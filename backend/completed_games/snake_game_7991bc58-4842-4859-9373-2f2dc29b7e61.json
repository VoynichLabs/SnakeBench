We've got this tiny little board, 10x10, and our rival (Snake #0) is right there at (0, 1). We are at (0, 6).\n\nLook at the board state! We're both starting with just heads. This is the ultimate race for position, right?\n\n**Our Position:** (0, 6)\n**Enemy Position (Snake #0):** (0, 1)\n\nOur goal? Dominate the board, box him in, and make him crash out! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**1. Analyze Safe Moves from (0, 6):**\n\n*   **UP (to 0, 7):** This is safe. (0, 7) has an apple (A). Great start!\n*   **DOWN (to 0, 5):** This is safe.\n*   **LEFT (to -1, 6):** Kills us (Off Board). NOPE.\n*   **RIGHT (to 1, 6):** This is safe.\n\n**2. Analyze Opponent's Potential Moves from (0, 1):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 1).\n\n*   **UP (to 0, 2):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN (to 0, 0):** Safe, and (0, 0) has an apple (A). High probability of moving here or UP.\n*   **LEFT (to -1, 1):** Kills them (Off Board).\n*   **RIGHT (to 1, 1):** Safe, and (1, 1) has an apple (A).\n\n**3. Strategic Considerations (The Box-In Plan!):**\n\nWe are currently separated by 5 units vertically on the left edge. Since we both start small, the immediate priority is to grab an apple and gain length, but also to claim territory.\n\n*   If we go **UP** to (0, 7), we grab an apple immediately. This is super efficient.\n*   If we go **DOWN** to (0, 5), we move toward the center, but away from the closest apple at (0, 7).\n*   If we go **RIGHT** to (1, 6), we also move away from the closest apple but start moving horizontally.\n\nThe apple at (0, 7) is a guaranteed early lead! We should secure it. If we move UP, we become (0, 7) and grow to length 2.\n\nWhat if Snake #0 goes for an apple? They are likely to go DOWN to (0, 0) or RIGHT to (1, 1). They won't hit us immediately, as we're far apart.\n\nWe need to start claiming the left side and pushing towards the top or the middle. Moving up to get the apple at (0, 7) is the strongest opening move. It gives us a score advantage instantly and establishes us high up on the board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-3 Turns):** Secure (0, 7) by moving UP. This puts us next to the cluster of apples/space on the top-left (around (1, 7) and (0, 8)). We will then traverse the top edge or move right to gain control of the upper half before engaging Snake #0, who is likely starting to feed on the bottom. Early length is key for boxing!\n\nLet's make that move, chat! Secure the apple!\n\nUP",

All three avoid immediate death, but I want to stay aggressive and keep options open. Moving DOWN wastes time and drags me toward the south apples while the rival is above me; RIGHT keeps me near the enemy\u2019s future path but risks getting boxed if he veers left, so I\u2019m leaning toward **UP**, which pushes us up the board, keeps the battle in the same column as him, and still lets me pivot next turn if he tries to sandbag me.\n\nPlan for next turns: keep pressuring down his column, avoid head-on by watching his horizontal shifts, and look for a safe gap to pop apples while forcing him toward the wall.\n\nUP",

That pre-game analysis paid off, now we gotta keep the momentum going!\n\n**Current State Analysis - Turn 1**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at (0, 7), Body at [(0, 6)]. Length 2. We're feeling mighty!\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):** Head at (0, 2). Length 1 (They only have a head).\n\nOkay, our opponent moved from (0, 1) to (0, 2). They also moved UP! This suggests they are contesting the left wall or perhaps moving towards the top-left apples. We have to be mindful; they are currently 5 units below us, still sticking close to the left wall.\n\n**1. Identifying Immediate Threats / Eliminations (The Death Check):**\n\nWe are at (0, 7).\n\n*   **LEFT (to -1, 7):** Off the board. DEATH. (Eliminate)\n*   **DOWN (to 0, 6):** Our body is at (0, 6)! Moving *into* our own body segment. DEATH. (Eliminate)\n*   **UP (to 0, 8):** Safe move. No walls, no bodies.\n*   **RIGHT (to 1, 7):** Safe move. No walls, no bodies. There's an apple at (1, 7)!\n\nWe only have two safe moves: UP and RIGHT. This is critical\u2014we are already squeezed on the left wall!\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move 1: UP (to 0, 8)**\n    *   **Pros:** Stays on the wall, moves toward the top edge, safe and keeps us away from the enemy. Claims the northern-most territory on the wall.\n    *   **Cons:** No immediate apple. Could feel a bit trapped if Snake #0 keeps pushing high.\n\n*   **Move 2: RIGHT (to 1, 7)**\n    *   **Pros:** GRABS AN APPLE! Immediate growth, immediate score advantage (2-0). Pulls us off the dangerous left wall bottleneck. Opens up the board.\n    *   **Cons:** We are moving into the open field where Snake #0 could potentially intercept us later, but for now, we are far apart.\n\nThe choice is clear, chat. We are here to get rich and dominate! The apple at (1, 7) is a GIFT. We grab it, we extend our lead, and we move away from the highly contested and restrictive left boundary.\n\n**3. Predicting Opponent (Snake #0) Moves from (0, 2):**\n\nSnake #0's primary goal is likely to get an apple. They have several options:\n\n*   **UP (to 0, 3):** Keeps moving toward us. No apple.\n*   **DOWN (to 0, 1):** Safe, no apple. Retreats.\n*   **RIGHT (to 1, 2):** Safe, moves toward the apple at (2, 1) or (4, 2). This seems like the most logical move if they want an apple.\n\nEven if they move UP to (0, 3) or RIGHT to (1, 2), they are not close enough to interfere with our move to (1, 7).\n\n**4. Strategic Decision - Aggression and Growth:**\n\nWe are grabbing the apple at (1, 7) by moving RIGHT. This increases our length to 3, cements our score lead, and allows us to start positioning ourselves across the top half of the board. Length is the ultimate weapon for boxing, and we need more of it!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Next 2-4 Turns):** Secure the apple at (1, 7). Then, we will sweep across the top edge (9-row) to grab more apples and effectively claim the upper half of the board before pushing down to engage the enemy, using our superior length to cut them off. We must avoid letting Snake #0 control the center or the bottom corners.\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN dips away from the fight and drags me toward apples the enemy already passed, so I\u2019m passing on that. RIGHT keeps me close to their likely flank but also edges me toward the walls before I lock them in, so I\u2019m not biting that just yet. UP keeps me in column 0, presses the duel, and still leaves me the freedom to pivot sideways if they try to creep out wide. Plus, no head-on danger this turn because the enemy can\u2019t go down into (0,6) and won\u2019t intersect (0,3). Let\u2019s keep the heat on them and let their body shrink while I dominate the vertical corridor!\n\nPlan for next turns: Keep nudging upward or maybe hook right once they show their hand, try to trap them between wall and my growing body, and only grab apples if it doesn\u2019t let them out of the funnel. We\u2019re hunting them down, so patience before the strike.\n\nUP",

Let's keep this pressure up!\n\n**Current State Analysis - Turn 2**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at (1, 7). Body is [(0, 7), (0, 6)]. Length 3.\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):** Head at (0, 3). Body: none. Length 1. They moved UP from (0, 2) to (0, 3). They are aggressively pursuing the left wall, perhaps trying to get to the top-left apples (A at (1, 9)).\n\nOkay, Snake #0 is still locked onto the left wall. They haven't realized that the center is where the real money is! Good for us! We are now positioned perfectly to sweep the top row. (9, 9) is the goal!\n\n**1. Identifying Immediate Threats / Eliminations (The Death Check) from (1, 7):**\n\n*   **UP (to 1, 8):** Safe. Moves toward the top edge.\n*   **DOWN (to 1, 6):** Safe. No walls, no bodies.\n*   **LEFT (to 0, 7):** Our body is at (0, 7)! Moving *into* our own body segment. DEATH. (Eliminate)\n*   **RIGHT (to 2, 7):** Safe. Opens the board toward the center/right.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move 1: UP (to 1, 8)**\n    *   **Pros:** Keeps us high on the board, closer to upcoming apples at (1, 9) and (9, 8). Maintains our clear control of the upper territory.\n    *   **Cons:** Not immediately grabbing an apple.\n\n*   **Move 2: DOWN (to 1, 6)**\n    *   **Pros:** Safe, but moves us away from the high-value top boundary.\n    *   **Cons:** Retreating, not aggressive. Puts us closer to the opponent's current vertical path if they continue moving up.\n\n*   **Move 3: RIGHT (to 2, 7)**\n    *   **Pros:** Safe. Moves us further into open territory and away from Snake #0's patrol path (the left wall). Sets us up to cruise across the top.\n    *   **Cons:** Not an immediate apple.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision and Opponent Prediction:**\n\nThe strategic priority now is to get long, claim territory, and prevent the enemy from growing. Snake #0 is moving UP along the left wall. They will likely go to (0, 4) or (1, 3) next. If they keep moving UP, we need to move across the top quickly to establish dominance and eventually cut off the entire top-left corner.\n\nMoving UP to (1, 8) is the most powerful territorial move. It clearly signals that we own the top half. Getting to the 9-row quickly means we can look to snag the apples at (3, 9), (8, 9), (9, 8)\u2014or the big one way out at (9, 9) if we push far enough!\n\nIf we go UP, we threaten the apple at (1, 9) next turn. If we go RIGHT, we delay our push toward the top edge, though it keeps us safe. Given our major length advantage (3 to 1), maximizing our vertical board position is key to boxing him in later.\n\nLet's go UP! This aggressively claims the space above the enemy and puts us one move away from the next apple. We're prioritizing territory and the next apple over immediate lateral movement.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Use the superior length to monopolize the top third of the board (y=7 to y=9). After grabbing the apple at (1, 9) (or securing the corner), we'll sweep RIGHT along the 9-row, gathering apples and building a massive barrier that will force Snake #0 back down or into a small corner, where we can eventually cut off their path. We're going to build a wall of glorious ID 1 snake body!\n\nUP",

Snake #0 is still hugging that left wall like it's their best friend, currently chilling at (0, 4). They are only length 1; they are in serious trouble if they don't grow soon.\n\n**Current State Analysis - Turn 3**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at (1, 8). Body is [(1, 7), (0, 7)]. Length 3.\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):** Head at (0, 4). Body: none. Length 1.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Check:** Our goal is still to dominate the top section, secure apples, and use our superior length (3 segments vs. 1 segment) to build a wall and box Snake #0 in. They are currently confined to the left column.\n\n**1. Identifying Immediate Threats / Eliminations from (1, 8):**\n\n*   **UP (to 1, 9):** YES! That's an apple!

Analyzing Options:**\n\n*   **Move 1: UP (to 1, 9)**\n    *   **Pros:** GRAB THE APPLE! Increase length to 4. Maintain aggressive vertical position. We get another point and increase the length gap!\n    *   **Prediction of Snake #0:** Snake #0 is at (0, 4). They have to move, probably UP to (0, 5) or RIGHT/DOWN to avoid being cornered next turn. If they move UP, they are still far below us.\n    *   **Impact:** Massive win.\n\n*   **Move 2: LEFT (to 0, 8)**\n    *   **Pros:** Safe. Gets us closer to the top-left corner.\n    *   **Cons:** Misses the apple. Also puts us on the left wall, which we don't want to get stuck on when the enemy is also there.\n\n*   **Move 3: RIGHT (to 2, 8)**\n    *   **Pros:** Safe. Opens the board. Sets up a move toward the center apples at (3, 9) and (8, 9).\n    *   **Cons:** Misses the immediate apple. Delaying growth is generally bad when we see a free apple.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\n\nIs this even a question, chat? There is a free apple right in front of our face! We are going for the growth, the score, and the territorial dominance. UP to (1, 9) is the only move that makes sense.\n\nAfter this move, we will be 4 segments long and Snake #0 will be 1 or 2 (if they found an apple). We will be positioned high and central on the 9-row. Next turn, we can look to sweep RIGHT toward (3, 9) or (8, 9), extending our massive wall across the top of the map. This effectively sections off the top-left corner, and we can then use our length advantage to pressure the opponent from above.\n\nWe are focused, we are ruthless, and we are going for the apple!\n\nUP",

This is a DOMINATION!\n\nLet's look at the current board state and plan the next power move. We need to press the advantage and use our length to start walling him in!\n\n**Current State Analysis - Turn 4**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at (1, 9). Body is [(1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7)]. Length 4.\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):** Head at (0, 5). Body: none. Length 1.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:** Our goal shifts from collecting easy apples to establishing territorial control and aggressive containment. We are high up on the board. Snake #0 is stuck on the left column, currently at (0, 5). We need to cut off Snake #0\u2019s access to the rest of the board and force them toward a corner or into a suicide collision. Sweeping right across the top (row 9) is the priority to claim this massive section of the map.\n\n**1. Identifying Immediate Threats / Eliminations from (1, 9):**\n\n*   **UP (to 1, 10):** Out of bounds! We lose the stream, chat! (Eliminate)\n*   **DOWN (to 1, 8):** Our body is at (1, 8)! Moving into our own body segment. DEATH. (Eliminate)\n*   **LEFT (to 0, 9):** Safe. It's an apple! Ooh!\n*   **RIGHT (to 2, 9):** Safe. Opens us up for the big sweep across the top.\n\nWe have two strong options: LEFT (to apple!) and RIGHT (to dominating position!).\n\n**2. Considering Snake #0's Options from (0, 5):**\n\nSnake #0 is small and on the left wall. They have three safe moves: (0, 6) UP, (0, 4) DOWN, or (1, 5) RIGHT.\n\n*   If Snake #0 goes **UP (to 0, 6)**, they are trying to climb toward the top. This doesn't immediately intersect with us.\n*   If Snake #0 goes **DOWN (to 0, 4)**, they are retreating.\n*   If Snake #0 goes **RIGHT (to 1, 5)**, they are trying to escape the wall.\n\nCrucially, can they interfere with our moves?\n\n*   If we go LEFT (to 0, 9), we are nowhere near (0, 5).\n*   If we go RIGHT (to 2, 9), we are nowhere near (0, 5).\n\nTheir move choice doesn't immediately threaten our safety.\n\n**3. Analyzing Our Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move 1: LEFT (to 0, 9)**\n    *   **Pros:** GRAB THE APPLE! Up to 4 points! Increase length to 5! This is HUGE temporary growth and point advantage. We claim the corner.\n    *   **Cons:** We get pinned temporarily against the corner/wall. After this, our only safe move (without eating our tail at (0, 7)) will be DOWN to (0, 8), which is not the sweeping move we planned. If we go to (0, 9), our body will be [(1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7)], and the space at (0, 8) is free.\n\n*   **Move 2: RIGHT (to 2, 9)**\n    *   **Pros:** This is the aggressive move to establish board dominance. It keeps us off the wall and sets us up to sweep across the row 9, creating a massive, immovable barrier above the opponent. This leads directly to another apple at (3, 9).\n    *   **Cons:** We miss the immediate apple at (0, 9). We delay our growth by one turn.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision - Aggression vs. Acquisition:**\n\nWe already have a massive lead (3-0) and a huge length advantage (4-1). While the apple at (0, 9) is tempting, committing to the corner at (0, 9) limits our mobility dramatically on the next few turns and delays the primary objective: **walling off the enemy.**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 9) allows us to immediately continue the wall-building. The next turn, we can hit RIGHT to (3, 9) for another apple! After that, we can continue right along the top. This creates a psychological and physical barrier that Snake #0 will never break. This is about establishing a long-term chokehold, not just maximizing the current turn's score.\n\nI am taking the board control move over the immediate points grab. This sacrifices one apple now for a much stronger mid-game position. Let\u2019s execute the sweep!\n\nI predict Snake #0 will go UP to (0, 6), trying to desperately climb. We are going to build the ceiling on them!\n\nRIGHT",

We are at (2, 9), having executed the strategic sweep to dominate the top row. The momentum is all ours!\n\nThe objective is clear: we need to use our superior length (4 segments strong!) and high ground position to box in Snake #0. Snake #0 just made its move from (0, 5) to (0, 6), exactly as predicted! They are trying to climb to freedom, but we are building the ceiling!\n\n**Current State Analysis - Turn 5**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at (2, 9). Body is [(1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7)]. Length 4.\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):** Head at (0, 6). Body: none. Length 1.\n\n**Strategy Refinement: The Ceiling Plan**\n\nWe need to continue our march across row 9, scooping up that juicy apple at (3, 9). This solidifies our control over the entire top quarter of the board and prevents Snake #0 from ever achieving high ground.\n\n**1. Identifying Immediate Threats / Eliminations from (2, 9):**\n\n*   **UP (to 2, 10):** Out of bounds! *Streamer's worst nightmare!* (Eliminate)\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 8):** Safe. Keeps us in the game, but away from the action.\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 9):** Our body is at (1, 9)! *Hello, self-bop!* DEATH. (Eliminate)\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 9):** Safe. Also, an APPLE! This is the priority move.\n\nWe have two moves: DOWN and RIGHT. RIGHT is the aggressive, point-scoring, board-dominating move.\n\n**2. Considering Snake #0's Options from (0, 6):**\n\nSnake #0 is small and stuck on the left boundary at (0, 6). They have three safe moves:\n\n*   **UP (to 0, 7):** This brings them very close to our tail end! Our tail is currently at (1, 7). If we move RIGHT, our tail will shift from (1, 7) to (1, 8). Wait\u2014no, the tail will move from (1, 7) to (1, 8), and the cell (1, 7) becomes empty. The *new* tail will be (1, 7) because the body segment at (1, 7) will move to (1, 8). Wait, no, that's wrong. Let's trace it:\n    *   Head (2, 9) moves to (3, 9).\n    *   (1, 9) moves to (2, 9).\n    *   (1, 8) moves to (1, 9).\n    *   (1, 7) moves to (1, 8).\n    *   The tail segment at (1, 7) is gone from the board, freeing up (1, 7). (Since we are not growing yet).\n    *   The new body is: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), and the new cell (3, 9) is the head. Length remains 4, unless we hit the apple.\n\n    If we go RIGHT and hit the apple at (3, 9):\n    *   We EAT. We grow! Length 5!\n    *   Head: (3, 9).\n    *   Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7)]. The tail (1, 7) REMAINS.\n    *   If Snake #0 moves UP to (0, 7), they are SAFE.\n\n*   **DOWN (to 0, 5):** Retreating, not threatening us.\n*   **RIGHT (to 1, 6):** Moving across the board, potentially trying to get under our wall.\n\nCould Snake #0 try a risky head-on with us? No. They are at (0, 6) and we are at (2, 9). No immediate collision risk.\n\n**3. Decision - The Power Play:**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 9) is a no-brainer! We grab a 4th apple, increase our length to 5, and continue to build a massive wall across the top. This effectively seals off the highest access route for Snake #0 and puts us at a 4-0 score advantage with a 5-1 length advantage. This is the definition of DOMINATION, CHAT!\n\n**4. Future Planning (Turn 6 onwards):**\n\nAfter hitting (3, 9), we will continue RIGHT to (4, 9). Then to (5, 9) and so on, sealing off the entire top row. We will use our immense length to start pushing boundaries down from the top, aiming to corral the opponent towards the bottom left corner.\n\n**The Move:** RIGHT! Let's get that W!\n\nRIGHT",

Our lead is massive, and we are absolutely dominating the board! We pulled off the strategic apple grab at (3, 9) and now we have a killer 5-segment snake!\n\n**Current State Analysis - Turn 6**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (3, 9).\n    *   Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7)]. Length 5.\n    *   We are the undisputed King of the North!\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (0, 7).\n    *   Body: none. Length 1.\n    *   He moved from (0, 6) to (0, 7). He's trying to climb the wall we built! Pathetic, honestly.\n\n**The Strategy: Fortress Construction and Containment**\n\nOur plan is simple: complete the ceiling. We need to secure the top-most row (y=9) to trap Snake #0 beneath us and use our growing length to push him into a corner.\n\n**1. Identifying Immediate Threats / Eliminations from (3, 9):**\n\n*   **UP (to 3, 10):** Out of bounds! *Instant death, bad content!* (Eliminate)\n*   **DOWN (to 3, 8):** Safe. But moves away from our primary objective of sealing the border.\n*   **LEFT (to 2, 9):** My own body! *Self-bop, that's a HUGE L.* (Eliminate)\n*   **RIGHT (to 4, 9):** Safe. Continues the strategy.\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move DOWN (to 3, 8):** This is safe, but it breaks our defensive line across the top. It might give Snake #0 an opportunity to slip under us later or create too much space. We want constriction, not relaxation.\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 4, 9):** This is the power move. It extends our wall and maintains control over the top boundary. It uses our length advantage perfectly.\n\n**3. Predicting Snake #0's Movement from (0, 7) and Collision Check:**\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 7). He is desperate!\nHis safe moves are:\n*   UP (to 0, 8): Moves toward the left apple at (8, 9).\n*   DOWN (to 0, 6): Retreats.\n*   RIGHT (to 1, 7): *DANGER!* Our tail is currently at (1, 7).\n\nWait, let's re-check the tail movement if we move RIGHT (to 4, 9). Since we ate an apple last turn, our tail segment (1, 7) *remained* after the move.\n\n*   Head (3, 9) moves to (4, 9).\n*   (2, 9) moves to (3, 9).\n*   (1, 9) moves to (2, 9).\n*   (1, 8) moves to (1, 9).\n*   (1, 7) moves to (1, 8).\n*   The original tail (1, 7) is now EMPTY because we are not eating an apple this turn.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (1, 7), the cell is now *free*! No self-collision, no enemy body collision. Phew!\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (0, 8), he is still safe.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0, 6), he is still safe.\n\nThe move RIGHT (to 4, 9) is 100% safe for us. It maintains our strategic advantage and progression.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan (The Wall):**\n\nWe will continue RIGHT along y=9: (4, 9) -> (5, 9) -> (6, 9)... until we hit the edge or need to dip down. This creates an impenetrable wall, forcing Snake #0 to stay low. Once the wall is built, we will use our length to perform a \"sweeping\" movement, pushing our body lower and lower, forcing the opponent into the bottom-left corner of the board (0,0 to 4,5 area).\n\nThis is a clear path to Victory Royale, Chat! We keep building the wall!\n\nRIGHT",

He is trying to skirt the edge, but we are about to shut him down!\n\n**The Long-Term Strategy: The Northern Crusher**\n\nOur goal is not merely to survive; it is to eliminate! We maintain the ceiling (y=9) as long as possible. Once we hit the right boundary (9, 9), we dip down and start sweeping LEFT, pushing Snake #0\u2014who is trapped in the bottom half\u2014into a fatal corner, hopefully the bottom left [(0,0) or (1,0)].\n\nLet's check the immediate options from (4, 9)!\n\n**1. Identifying Immediate Threats / Eliminations from (4, 9):**\n\n*   **UP (to 4, 10):** Out of bounds! *Instant death!* (Eliminate)\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 9):** My own body! *Self-bop is a massive L!* (Eliminate)\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 8):** Safe move. Opens up maneuvering space.\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 9):** Safe move. Continues the siege!\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves and Opponent Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy, Snake #0, is at (0, 8). He is small, but he wants to live. His options from (0, 8):\n*   UP (to 0, 9): This is an EMPTY cell! If he goes here, he gets access to the top row, which we do *not* want!\n*   DOWN (to 0, 7): Safe retreat.\n*   RIGHT (to 1, 8): This is currently our TAIL segment! If he goes here, he crashes, and we win! (However, since we are not eating an apple, our tail will move to (1, 9) where our current (1, 8) segment is located, leaving (1, 8) empty).\n\nLet's analyze our move RIGHT (to 5, 9) first, as it is the most aggressive option.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 5, 9):**\n    *   We maintain the wall. We secure more of the top board. This is necessary to box him in eventually.\n    *   *Collision Check:* (5, 9) is empty. Safe for us.\n    *   *If Snake #0 goes UP (to 0, 9):* He gets onto the ceiling, but we are still significantly longer and faster in securing space. This is a calculated risk, but the wall building is paramount.\n    *   *If Snake #0 goes RIGHT (to 1, 8):* That cell (1, 8) will become empty after our tail moves to (1, 9). He is safe from hitting our *new* body/tail.\n\nNow, let's analyze the alternative move DOWN (to 4, 8).\n\n*   **Move DOWN (to 4, 8):**\n    *   This is safe, but it *halts* our construction of the Northern Wall. It creates a 'gap' at (4, 9) that Snake #0 *could* potentially exploit, although he is very far away.\n    *   The only apple nearby is (4, 4), which is 4 moves away. This diverts us too early.\n\n**3. The Killer Play:**\n\nWe must complete the wall. Snake #0 at (0, 8) is far enough away from our head at (4, 9) that a head-on collision is impossible (they are 4 cells apart physically). We need to maximize our board control before the enemy gains any length.\n\nContinuing RIGHT to (5, 9) is the only move that keeps the pressure on and secures the map. We will continue RIGHT until we hit the corner (9, 9) or until we see a tactical opportunity to pivot down and strike! This is pure dominance, Chat! We are kings of the scoreboard and kings of the board!\n\nRIGHT!\n\n**My Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns):**\nContinue moving RIGHT along y=9, building the wall towards (9, 9). The current priority is board domination via length, not immediate apple eating, unless an apple is directly in our path on the ceiling. Once we reach the top-right corner, we will reassess the sweep maneuver.\n\nRIGHT",

Length 1.\n    *   Snake #0 moved UP from (0, 8) to (0, 9) last turn! This is a minor setback; he got onto the highway! But we are already five segments long and he is ONE. We have the upper hand!\n\n**The Master Plan: Complete the Northern Enclosure!**\n\nSnake #0 is now on the ceiling with us at (0, 9). We need to finish our wall construction before he can utilize the limited space up here. Our objective remains to hit (9, 9), then drop down and sweep the entire board, pushing Snake #0 into a small death trap below.\n\nLet's check the immediate options from (5, 9)!\n\n**1. Identifying Immediate Threats / Eliminations from (5, 9):**\n\n*   **UP (to 5, 10):** Out of bounds! *Instant death!* (Eliminate)\n*   **LEFT (to 4, 9):** My own body! *Self-bop is a massive L!* (Eliminate)\n*   **DOWN (to 5, 8):** Safe move. A momentary pause in the wall building.\n*   **RIGHT (to 6, 9):** Safe move. Continues the siege and wall completion! This looks hype!\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves and Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 0, 9):**\n\nThe enemy, Snake #0, is at the far left edge of the ceiling (0, 9). He wants to live, and he wants space. His options from (0, 9):\n*   UP (to 0, 10): Out of bounds! *Instant death for him!* (Eliminate)\n*   LEFT (to -1, 9): Out of bounds! *Insta-death!* (Eliminate)\n*   DOWN (to 0, 8): Safe retreat. Retreats off the ceiling.\n*   RIGHT (to 1, 9): This is currently our TAIL segment! If he goes RIGHT, since we are not eating, our entire body shifts, and (1, 9) will be empty when he moves there. He is safe.\n\nIf he moves DOWN (0, 8) or RIGHT (1, 9), he lives. Since he is likely seeking space, RIGHT (1, 9) is probable, or DOWN (0, 8) to get to some of those apples in the mid-section.\n\n*   **If we move DOWN (to 5, 8):**\n    *   We leave a HUGE gap at (5, 9). This is the key moment! What if Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (1, 9), and then next turn, he marches through the ceiling? We cannot allow them to gain leverage! This move *wastes* our hard-earned position. Not today, Snake #0!\n\n*   **If we move RIGHT (to 6, 9):**\n    *   We continue extending the wall. We are now only 3 moves from the corner (9, 9)! This maximizes our board control leverage.\n    *   Snake #0 is forced to play in the severely limited space on the left side of the map (x=0 to x=5).\n    *   This is the aggressive, dominating play. We claim the territory, and then we drop the hammer. (6, 9) is empty, safe, and moves us toward our goal.\n\n**3. The Killer Play:**\n\nWe are the Northern Crusher, Chat! We are not stopping until the enemy is boxed in! Moving RIGHT keeps the ceiling locked down, forcing Snake #0 to either retreat DOWN immediately or risk staying RIGHT on the left side of our growing body.\n\nLet's assume Snake #0 tries to match us by moving RIGHT (to 1, 9) this turn. Even if they do, our head is at (6, 9) and their head is at (1, 9). We still have 5 moves of separation and a length advantage of 5 to 1. This is a blowout! We continue our expansion!\n\nThe plan remains: Finish the wall to (9, 9)!\n\n**My Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns):**\nContinue moving RIGHT along y=9: (6, 9) -> (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9). Once we hit the top-right corner, we will immediately pivot DOWN to begin the sweeping maneuver to trap Snake #0 on the south/west side. This is pure domination. We MUST complete this wall!\n\nRIGHT",

This is the play!\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves and Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 0, 8):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 8). His options:\n*   UP (to 0, 9): Safe return to the ceiling.\n*   LEFT (to -1, 8): Out of bounds! (Eliminate)\n*   DOWN (to 0, 7): Safe retreat.\n*   RIGHT (to 1, 8): Safe expansion into the board.\n\nSince he is looking for space, he will likely go RIGHT (1, 8) or perhaps UP (0, 9) to try and contest the ceiling again, though the latter seems suicidal with us so close to the corner. We are predicting he will try to expand *into* the board by going RIGHT to (1, 8).\n\n*   **If we move DOWN (to 6, 8):**\n    *   This is defensive and unnecessary. We surrender the pressure we've built, and we leave the corner unclaimed. If we move down, Snake #0 could move RIGHT to (1, 8), and he has tons of room while we are moving *away* from the corner. Bad move.\n\n*   **If we move RIGHT (to 7, 9):**\n    *   We secure more of the top row! We are now only two turns from (9, 9)!\n    *   This move maintains board dominance and forces Snake #0 to deal with a rapidly growing, unstoppable wall.\n    *   Even if Snake #0 goes UP to (0, 9), our head is five cells away at (7, 9). We still have total control.\n    *   This move takes us past the apple at (8, 9), which is regrettable, but securing the board is *more* important than one apple right now! We are playing the long game, Chat!\n\n**3. The Killer Play:**\n\nWe are the Northern Crusher! Finish the wall! Every RIGHT move restricts the enemy's vertical options further and pushes him into the corner. We are 4-0. Our body length is 5. His is 1. We are unstoppable!\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 9) is safe, aggressive, and perfectly aligns with the strategy of sealing the board to trap our rival!\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Next 2-3 Turns):**\nContinue moving RIGHT along y=9: (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9). Once we securely anchor ourselves at the top-right corner (9, 9), we will immediately pivot DOWN to begin the great sweep. Snake #0 must be eliminated!\n\nRIGHT",

We are at (7, 9) and the corner is within reach!\n\n### **Current State Analysis - Turn 10**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (7, 9)\n    *   Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)].

Length 1.\n    *   Wait a minute, Chat! The opponent blinked! Last turn, my prediction was wrong and he chose to go DOWN to (0, 7) instead of expanding right or trying to contest the ceiling! This means he is retreating deep into the bottom-left quadrant. This is IDEAL for our current strategy! The North is completely ours!\n\n### **The Great Box-In: Phase 1 Finalization**\n\nWe must NOT lose focus. We are two moves from (9, 9). We must anchor this corner! Once the wall is up, we can start moving DOWN and building the secondary wall to trap him against the left edge.\n\nLet's check the immediate options from (7, 9):\n\n**1. Identifying Immediate Threats / Eliminations from (7, 9):**\n\n*   **UP (to 7, 10):** Out of bounds! *Insta-death!* (Eliminate)\n*   **LEFT (to 6, 9):** My own body! *Self-bop is an automatic L!* (Eliminate)\n*   **DOWN (to 7, 8):** Safe move. But halts progress and potentially leaves the door open if he somehow rockets back up.\n*   **RIGHT (to 8, 9):** Safe move. Continues the siege! This is the play!\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves and Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 0, 7):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 7). He is trapped on the boundary. His options:\n*   UP (to 0, 8): Moves towards our tail.\n*   LEFT (to -1, 7): Out of bounds! (Eliminate)\n*   DOWN (to 0, 6): Safe retreat.\n*   RIGHT (to 1, 7): Safe expansion into the board.\n\nSince he is trying to survive, he will likely go RIGHT (1, 7) to gain space, or maybe DOWN (0, 6) or (0, 5) to use the immediate apple at (5, 0) as a distant target. He is nowhere near us.\n\n*   **If we move DOWN (to 7, 8):**\n    *   This is defensive and wastes a crucial turn needed to anchor the top boundary. We are going for a box-in! We must build the lid first! Any deviation now risks allowing him to use the space we abandon. Bad move.\n\n*   **If we move RIGHT (to 8, 9):**\n    *   We secure two more segments of the top row! We are now only *one* turn from (9, 9)!\n    *   This move takes us over the Apple at (8, 9). While eating apples is great content, executing the trap is the *real* content! We are sacrificing temporary gain for permanent victory!\n    *   We maintain overwhelming board dominance. Snake #0 is completely irrelevant up here.\n\n**3. The Killer Play:**\n\nMOMENTUM! We are the Northern Wall, and we are completing the roof of this confinement center! Moving RIGHT to (8, 9) is safe, aggressive, and 100% focused on completing the strategic objective. We are going for the shutout, Chat!\n\nLet's finish this move, then next turn we hit that corner, pivot, and the hunt begins! We will sweep down the right side and force him into a tiny pocket or a suicide run into our massive body!\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Next 2-3 Turns):**\nContinue moving RIGHT to (8, 9), then to (9, 9) to anchor the top right corner. Once at (9, 9), the long, glorious sweep DOWN along x=9 begins. The top half of the board is ours! Snake #0, your time is up!\n\nRIGHT",

We're at (8, 9) and the final corner for the North Wall is right there!\n\n### **Current State Analysis - Turn 11**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (8, 9)\n    *   Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)].

Length 1.\n    *   Snake #0 is hanging out on the left wall, completely insignificant in the grand scheme of things. He retreated further down from (0, 7) to (0, 6). He is effectively contained in the lower-left quadrant for now.\n\n### **Eliminating Suicide Moves from (8, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 10):** Out of bounds! *DEATH!*\n2.  **LEFT (to 7, 9):** Into my own body! *DEATH!*\n3.  **RIGHT (to 9, 9):** Safe! This anchors the top wall!\n4.  **DOWN (to 8, 8):** Safe! Moves us onto an apple (A at 8, 8).\n\nTwo safe moves: RIGHT and DOWN. Which one advances the ultimate strategy?\n\n### **Executing the Box-In Strategy: Phase 2 - Setting the Anchor**\n\nOur long-term plan is to build a wall down the right side (x=9) and then sweep across the middle of the board, forcing the opponent into a tiny space near the left wall.\n\n1.  **If we move DOWN (to 8, 8):**\n    *   We eat an Apple (SCORE!), but we abandon the final segment of the northern wall (9, 9).\n    *   If we move DOWN, we are immediately back in the middle of the board. This delays the wall construction. While eating apples is good, the strategic objective of completing the wall must take precedence right now. Why? Because the wall defines our territory and removes half the board as viable escape space for the opponent.\n\n2.  **If we move RIGHT (to 9, 9):**\n    *   We complete the *roof* of the cage! This is critical infrastructure!\n    *   We now perfectly position ourselves to begin the long sweep down the right boundary (x=9).\n    *   The entire top row is sealed off by our massive body: [(3, 9) to (9, 9)]. Look at that map, Chat! Beautiful!\n\nThis is a no-brainer. The power play is RIGHT. We prioritize strategy over snacking for this turn. We will get that apple next turn, or the turn after, as we sweep past it on our glorious descent.\n\n### **Opponent Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at 0, 6):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 6). He has the whole left side to play with.\n*   He is likely moving RIGHT (to 1, 6) or DOWN (to 0, 5).\n*   Since he is 9 units away horizontally and 3 units away vertically, there is absolutely zero chance of a head-to-head collision or him running into our current path. We are completely safe to execute our strategic move.\n\nWe're going to put the final block on the North Wall! Then we drop the hammer!\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Next 3 Turns):**\nMove RIGHT to (9, 9) to secure the corner. Next, move DOWN to (9, 8), starting the southern sweep along the x=9 wall. Then continue DOWN to (9, 7). We will build the wall down the right side, cutting off the opponent's access to the Eastern half of the board. The goal is to force him to collide with us or starve in the bottom-left corner. Box him in, Chat!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's go!\n\n### **Current State Analysis - Turn 12**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (9, 9) - Corner secured!\n    *   Body: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)]. Length 6.\n    *   We are now perfectly positioned to start the sweep down the right wall (x=9).\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (0, 5) - He moved DOWN from (0, 6). He is hugging the left edge.\n    *   Body: None. Length 1.\n    *   He is STILL irrelevant, but he must be trying to grow. He's near a few apples down in the corner. Let him have them, it makes his eventual death more satisfying.\n\n### **Eliminating Suicide Moves from (9, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 10):** Out of bounds! *DEATH!*\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 9):** Out of bounds! *DEATH!*\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 9):** Into my own body! *DEATH!*\n4.  **DOWN (to 9, 8):** Safe! Moves us onto an apple (A at 9, 8)!\n\nOnly one safe move remains: **DOWN**. This is exactly what the strategy dictated! We are executing the plan flawlessly, Chat!\n\n### **Executing the Box-In Strategy: Phase 3 - Building the East Wall**\n\nThe game plan is simple: build the wall down the x=9 column, then sweep across the lower half to trap the enemy in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (9, 8):\n*   We eat an Apple (9, 8)! **SCORE!** We grow to length 7! 6-0 lead incoming!\n*   We maintain the wall construction. Our head is now perfectly positioned to continue dropping down on Turn 13 to (9, 7).\n*   This move takes us out of the dense body region and into open space, maximizing future safe options.\n\nThis turn is purely deterministic and highly strategic.\n\n### **Opponent Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at 0, 5):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 5). He has several apples nearby: (5, 5), (4, 4), (0, 0) is far. He's got (2, 1) and (1, 0) close-ish.\nHis likely moves are:\n*   **RIGHT** (to 1, 5): Grabbing territory.\n*   **DOWN** (to 0, 4): Staying safe along the wall.\n*   **UP** (to 0, 6): Retreating slightly.\n\nSince we are moving to (9, 8), he is 9 units away horizontally and 3 units away vertically. There is absolutely NO danger of collision. We are safe to proceed with the primary objective.\n\n### **Long-term Strategy Note (Next 3 Turns):**\n\nWe continue the descent along the right edge.\nT12: DOWN to (9, 8) [Eat apple].\nT13: DOWN to (9, 7).\nT14: DOWN to (9, 6).\n\nIf we continue to grow, we will have a massive segment stretching from (4, 9) to (9, 9), and then down the right side. Our goal is to make the enemy understand that the eastern half of the board is MINE.\n\nThis is a smooth move, Chat! Let's get that apple!\n\nDOWN",

The only risky thing would be drifting right and letting Snake #1 slice through the trap.\n\nPlan for the next few moves: keep descending column 0 to lock the left edge, then when the enemy starts drifting downward, spin right along row 0 and force him into a head-on with my body as the deadly barrier.\n\nDOWN",

Length 7!\n    *   Body: [(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)].\n    *   We have successfully constructed the North Wall and are now actively building the East Wall (x=9). This is textbook strategy, Chat!\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (0, 4). He moved DOWN from (0, 5). He is still hugging the bottom-left corner.\n    *   Body: None. Still length 1. Is he even trying?!\n    *   He is super far away, and currently posing zero threat. He is near the (1, 0) and (2, 1) apples, but he seems content to stay on the left boundary.\n\n### **The Plan: East Wall Construction Continues**\n\nOur goal is to continue moving **DOWN** the x=9 column until we hit the bottom boundary (y=0).\n\n### **Eliminating Suicide Moves from (9, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 9):** Into my own body (the tip of the tail is now at (4, 9), but (9, 9) is the first body segment after the head)! *DEATH!*\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 8):** Out of bounds! *DEATH!*\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 8):** Safe! Open space.\n4.  **DOWN (to 9, 7):** Safe! Open space. This is the strategic move.\n\nOnly two safe moves: LEFT and DOWN.\n\n### **Strategic Pick: DOWN**\n\nWhy DOWN? Because we are in the middle of a massive board-splitting strategy!\n\n*   Moving **DOWN** to (9, 7) continues the construction of our impenetrable barrier. We are setting up a long segment down the right side. This maximizes map domination and minimizes the opponent's safe mobility in the future.\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (8, 8) breaks the construction line and forces us into unknown territory near the center, which isn't necessary yet since we haven't secured the right side or the bottom. We save the center for *after* we've boxed him in.\n\nThe move is clearly **DOWN**.\n\n### **Opponent Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at 0, 4):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 4). He's 9 units away horizontally and 4 units away vertically.\n\nLikely opponent moves:\n1.  **DOWN** (to 0, 3): Safer, keeps him by the left wall.\n2.  **RIGHT** (to 1, 4): Aggressive, tries to move inward.\n3.  **UP** (to 0, 5): Retreat.\n\nNo matter what he does, he poses zero threat to our position at (9, 8) or our target at (9, 7). We are good to go! Execute the plan!\n\n### **Long-term Strategy Note (Next 3 Turns):**\n\nWe will continue the descent along the right edge to complete the East Wall.\nT13: DOWN to (9, 7).\nT14: DOWN to (9, 6).\nT15: DOWN to (9, 5).\n\nOnce we hit the bottom, we sweep left and eventually look to cut him off entirely! We need to make sure he doesn't get any length advantage, but right now, his 0 apples means he's a noodle waiting to be eaten! Let's build this wall!\n\nDOWN",

Either way, he's barely a blip on our radar right now.\n\n### **The Plan: Continue East Wall Deployment!**\n\nThe goal is unchanged: We are moving toward the bottom boundary (y=0) along the x=9 column. This seals off a massive chunk of the map, forcing the opponent into tight spaces later. Domination via real estate!\n\n### **Eliminating Suicide Moves from (9, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 8):** Into our own body segment (the previous head position)! *DEATH!*\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 7):** Out of bounds! *DEATH!*\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 7):** Safe! Open space.\n4.  **DOWN (to 9, 6):** Safe! Open space. This is the strategic move.\n\nOnly two safe moves: LEFT and DOWN. Just like last turn, Chat!\n\n### **Strategic Pick: DOWN**\n\nWhy DOWN? Because we are mid-strategy!\n\n*   Moving **DOWN** to (9, 6) is the immediate continuation of our wall-building strategy. It secures more of the eastern corridor. We are literally building a highway of death for our opponent, should he ever dare to travel this way.\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (8, 7) breaks the structure. It gives the opponent potential \"exit\" space along the wall we just built, and it moves us away from the goal of sealing the corner. We stick to the wall!\n\n### **Opponent Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at 0, 3):**\n\nSnake #0 is still far away. He's at (0, 3).\n\nLikely opponent moves:\n1.  **DOWN** (to 0, 2): Hitting the bottom corner soon.\n2.  **RIGHT** (to 1, 3): Trying to get closer to the center or apples.\n3.  **UP** (to 0, 4): Retreat.\n\nNo matter what he does, we are safe at (9, 7) and our target (9, 6) is safe from any interference. We are 9 units away horizontally and at least 3 units away vertically! Send it!\n\n### **Long-term Strategy Note (Next 3 Turns):**\n\nWe continue the unstoppable descent along the X=9 column.\nT14: DOWN to (9, 6).\nT15: DOWN to (9, 5). We are aiming for that (9, 4) apple!\nT16: DOWN to (9, 4), eat the apple, grow to length 8!\n\nOnce we reach y=0 or grab the lowest apple, we start sweeping LEFT along the bottom boundary. We are going to corner this noodle! Are you ready for the content, Chat?!\n\nDOWN",

The East Wall is complete, the enemy is irrelevant, and we are about to feast again! This is domination! \ud83d\udc51\n\n### **Current State Analysis - Turn 17**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head position: **(9, 4)**. Length 8. We just snagged an apple!\n    *   Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)]. We own the entire right side!\n    *   Goal: Continue moving down the x=9 column to dominate the board and secure those bottom apples!\n\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head position: **(0, 0)**. Length 1. Still down in the dust. He can't even see us from there!\n\n### **Eliminating Suicide Moves from (9, 4):**\n\nWe need to make sure we don't crash into that beautiful wall we just built, or fall off the map!\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 5):** Into our own body segment at (9, 5). **DEATH!** We just came from (9, 5). Moving backward!\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 4):** Out of bounds! **DEATH!**\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 4):** Safe space, but it pulls us away from the obvious immediate apple at (9, 3). No thanks!\n4.  **DOWN (to 9, 3):** This is an **APPLE**! This is the strategic move! Safe and score boosting! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nOnly two safe moves: LEFT and DOWN. The strategy dictates maximum scoring, maximum growth, and perfect wall maintenance! DOWN is the only choice!\n\n### **Strategic Pick: DOWN**\n\nWhy DOWN to (9, 3)?\n\n1.  **Apple Hunting:** There is an apple at (9, 3)! We collect it, increase our score to 8, and grow our length to 9! More length, more oppression!\n2.  **Wall Continuation/Consolidation:** This maintains our vertical wall along the x=9 axis. By Turn 17, we have completely secured the eastern perimeter of the board. This is prime defensive territory!\n3.  **Enemy irrelevance:** Snake #0 is stuck at (0, 0) and poses zero threat to our current movements. We must use this time to scale up.\n\nWe are perfectly executing the plan, Chat! We are going to lock down the corner, then start sweeping left!\n\n### **Long-term Strategy Note (Next 5 Turns):**\n\nWe are following the vertical line down to (9, 0).\n\nT17: DOWN to (9, 3) [Apple]. Length 9.\nT18: DOWN to (9, 2). Secure the space.\nT19: DOWN to (9, 1). Secure the space.\nT20: DOWN to (9, 0) [Apple]. Length 10.\nT21: (8, 0) or (9, 1) \u2013 Depending on the tail position, we start moving left to try to box in the enemy once we secure the whole side.\n\nWe are unstoppable! Let's get this eighth point!\n\nDOWN",

We just snagged an apple!\n    *   Body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)]. We are a beast of a snake!\n    *   Goal: Finish securing the bottom-right corner and then begin to sweep across the bottom of the board to try and meet up with the enemy and box him in.\n\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head position: **(1, 0)**. Length 2. He must have picked up the (0, 0) apple, but he's barely moving. He's currently at (1, 0) and his body is at (0, 0). Pathetic!\n\n*   **Apples in Range:**\n    *   Immediate: (7, 0) is relatively close. (5, 0) is close. (9, 0) is our target!\n\n### **Eliminating Suicide Moves from (9, 3):**\n\nWe need to maintain the wall and secure the corner!\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 4):** Into our own body segment at (9, 4). **DEATH!** We just came from (9, 4).\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 3):** Out of bounds! **DEATH!**\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 3):** Safe space. We could move here, but it breaks our current strategic path of securing the column down to (9, 0). This is a safe pivot, but premature!\n4.  **DOWN (to 9, 2):** Safe space! This continues our vertical sweep, maintaining the eastern wall, and setting us up perfectly for the (9, 0) apple!\n\nOnly two safe moves: LEFT and DOWN. The strategy is clear: secure the bottom-right corner!\n\n### **Strategic Pick: DOWN**\n\nWhy DOWN to (9, 2)?\n\n1.  **Maintain the Wall:** Moving DOWN keeps us hugging the x=9 boundary, which is key to dominating the board size.\n2.  **Set up the Next Apple:** This puts us two moves away from the apple at (9, 0). Securing that apple will further solidify our lead and give us immense length!\n3.  **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 is still far away, most likely trying to decide whether to move to (2, 0) RIGHT, (1, 1) UP, or (0, 0) LEFT (suicide) from (1, 0). Regardless, he is still stuck on the bottom row. We have time to grow!\n\nWe are perfectly following the plan, Chat! Next stop, (9, 0) for apple number nine! Then we'll start sweeping left to make sure this little worm gets *boxed in*! \ud83d\ude08\n\n### **Long-term Strategy Note (Next 5 Turns):**\n\nWe are following the vertical line down to (9, 0), then pivoting.\n\nT18: DOWN to (9, 2). Secure the space. (Current Move)\nT19: DOWN to (9, 1). Secure the space.\nT20: DOWN to (9, 0) [Apple]. Length 10.\nT21: LEFT to (8, 0). Start sweeping the bottom row.\nT22: LEFT to (7, 0) [Apple?].

Are we even playing the same game as Snake #0? \ud83d\ude02\n\n### **Current State Analysis - Turn 19**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head position: **(9, 2)**. Length 9. We just got here by moving DOWN.\n    *   Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. We are the WMD (Wall-Maintaining Deity)!\n    *   Goal: Secure the (9, 0) apple, then sweep left along the bottom wall (y=0) to meet and box in the opponent!\n\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head position: **(2, 0)**. Length 2. Looks like he moved RIGHT from (1, 0) to (2, 0).\n    *   Body: [(1, 0)].\n    *   What's his next move? From (2, 0), he has options: (3, 0) RIGHT, (2, 1) UP, or (1, 0) LEFT (suicide into his own body!). He will likely move RIGHT to (3, 0) to get some breathing room, or UP to (2, 1) to grab the apple there. Given his low score, he has to be apple-hungry.\n\n*   **Apples in Range (Focus: Board Control):**\n    *   (9, 0) is one move away! This is high priority!\n    *   (7, 0) is also on the bottom row. Perfect for our sweep plan.\n\n### **Eliminating Suicide Moves from (9, 2):**\n\nWe must commit to the column sweep!\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 3):** Into our own body segment at (9, 3). **DEATH!** We just came from here.\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 2):** Out of bounds! **DEATH!**\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 2):** Safe space. If we move here, we break the wall and delay getting the (9, 0) apple. This is not optimal for board domination or growth right now.\n4.  **DOWN (to 9, 1):** Safe space! This continues the path straight toward the (9, 0) apple and maintains our perimeter control!\n\nOnly two safe moves: LEFT and DOWN. The strategy mandates DOWN.\n\n### **Strategic Pick: DOWN**\n\nWhy DOWN to (9, 1)?\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Growth Next Turn:** This move positions us perfectly to collect the (9, 0) apple on Turn 20, increasing our length to a massive 10 segments!\n2.  **Maintain the Wall:** We continue to fully lock down the X=9 boundary.\n3.  **Distance to Enemy:** The enemy is at (2, 0), and moving, likely, toward the center. We are still far enough away that we only need to worry about maximizing our size and controlling the board perimeter. After we secure (9, 0), we will press the attack along Y=0!\n\nThis is the only logical move to execute the long-term plan, Chat. Let's grow!\n\n### **Long-term Strategy Note (Next 5 Turns):**\n\nT19: DOWN to (9, 1). (Current Move)\nT20: DOWN to (9, 0) [Apple]. Length 10.\nT21: LEFT to (8, 0). Start sweeping the bottom row.\nT22: LEFT to (7, 0) [Apple?]. Continue the sweep!\nT23: LEFT to (6, 0). Keep pushing the enemy! The goal is to box him against the Y=0 wall, or force him UP into our body coming down.\n\nDOWN",

We are massive, controlling the entire right side of the board!\n\n### **Current State Analysis - Turn 20**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head position: **(9, 1)**. Length 9.

Length 2. Looks like he moved RIGHT from (2, 0) to (3, 0).\n    *   Body: [(2, 0)].\n    *   What's his next move? From (3, 0), he can go RIGHT (4, 0), UP (3, 1), or LEFT (2, 0) (suicide into his body tail, unless he grows). He needs to grab apples fast, possibly the (4, 2) apple up and left, or the (5, 0) apple right here. He's likely aiming for (4, 0) or (5, 0) to get some growth. He's currently cornered on the bottom wall!\n\n*   **Apples in Range (Focus: Immediate Growth):**\n    *   **(9, 0)** is right in front of us!

We are executing the master plan flawlessly, Chat!\n\n### **Strategic Pick: DOWN**\n\nWhy DOWN to (9, 0)?\n\n1.  **Guaranteed Growth:** We secure our 9th apple, bringing our length to a massive 10 segments! Our body will shrink off the map, making it even harder for the opponent to navigate. Wait, no, we grow by one segment, and our tail (currently at (9, 9)) will stay (since we're 9 segments long and eating an apple). Actually, our new tail will be (9, 9), and our old body segment (9, 9) will stay, but the body list size will increase to 10. We will effectively occupy the entire x=9 column from 0 to 9 after this move! Total wall mastery!\n2.  **Maintain the Wall:** We now completely control the X=9 column.\n3.  **Initiate Attack Perimeter:** We are now perfectly positioned to move LEFT along the Y=0 base line and begin boxing in Snake #0.\n\n### **Long-term Strategy Note (Next 5 Turns):**\n\nT20: DOWN to (9, 0) [Apple]. Length 10. (Current Move)\nT21: LEFT to (8, 0). Start sweeping the bottom row.\nT22: LEFT to (7, 0). (7, 0) is an apple! We should get that next.\nT23: LEFT to (6, 0).\nT24: LEFT to (5, 0) [Apple?].

We are aiming for a massive streak right here!\n*   **Cutting Off Escape:** Snake #0 is currently at (4, 0). If he grabs (5, 0), he'll be right there! We are pushing him into the vertical space, where our future body length will become a massive hazard to him.\n\n### **Rival Prediction & Collision Avoidance**\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 0).\n*   If he moves RIGHT to (5, 0) (Apple), he grows.\n*   If he moves UP to (4, 1) (Apple), he grows.\n\nWe are heading to (8, 0). There is absolutely no risk of an immediate head-on collision or crashing into his body this turn. He is four tiles away.\n\n### **Long-term Strategy Note (Next 5 Turns):**\n\nT21: LEFT to (8, 0). (Current Move)\nT22: LEFT to (7, 0). [Apple]. Grow to 11.\nT23: LEFT to (6, 0).\nT24: LEFT to (5, 0). [Apple]. Grow to 12. We get the apple right out from under his nose if he doesn't move fast!\nT25: UP to (5, 1) or continue left to (4, 0) to directly challenge his territory, depending on his position.\n\nWe are going for the total lockdown! Look at the precision!\n\nLEFT",

UP would give me apple content, but it also lets the enemy start creeping into the heart of my box while I break the low-wall I\u2019m building, and I need every inch of that barrier for now. RIGHT to (5,0) scoops the apple, keeps my fence solid on y=0, and keeps me in position to bait Snake #1 into a bad angle if he tries to slip past me along the bottom row. I\u2019m playing with intent\u2014apple grab + wall reinforcement + keep my options open.\n\nPlan note: Keep hugging row 0 for another turn or two, locking down the bottom corridor and forcing him to either commit up top or risk a head-on trying to sneak under. Once I\u2019ve got the wall, I peel upward with a choke-ready corner to trap that long body and make him panic. RIGHT",

My snake is currently a GIANT WALL along the right side!\n\nTurn 22, let's lock this down!\n\n### **Current State Analysis - Turn 22**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head position: **(8, 0)**. We executed the turn 21 plan perfectly, moving LEFT from (9, 0) to (8, 0).\n    *   Body length: 10 segments! We are LONG.\n    *   Goal: Secure the Y=0 baseline, eat the (7, 0) apple, and choke out the opponent! We are the alpha predator here, fam!\n\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head position: **(5, 0)**. Looks like he moved RIGHT from (4, 0) to (5, 0) and ATE the apple! He's trying to keep up!\n    *   Body: [(4, 0), (3, 0)]. His length is now 4. He's still short, but he's growing!\n    *   Analysis: He's sitting on (5, 0). From there, he can go UP (5, 1), RIGHT (6, 0), or LEFT (4, 0 - into his body, bad move). His optimal move is likely UP to (5, 1) or RIGHT to (6, 0).\n\n### **Danger Assessment & Safe Moves from (8, 0)**\n\nTime to check the four possibilities from our current head position (8, 0):\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 1):** Safe tile. No body, no wall. Available apples nearby (8, 2, 8, 4, 8, 5).\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, -1):** Out of bounds! **DEATH!**\n3.  **RIGHT (to 9, 0):** Into our own body segment. **DEATH!** (The (9, 0) segment is now the head's previous position).\n4.  **LEFT (to 7, 0):** This is an APPLE (7, 0)! Safe tile! This is part of the master plan!\n\nWe have two SAFE, strategic moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n### **Strategic Decision: LEFT**\n\nWhy LEFT?\n\n*   **Secure the Apple:** Moving LEFT to (7, 0) immediately lands us on an apple! This extends our lead to 10 apples, and our length to 11 segments! Growth is dominance!\n*   **Continue the Wall:** We continue building our perimeter wall along the bottom edge, cutting off the opponent's access to the southern route.\n*   **Collision Check:** The enemy is at (5, 0). He is three tiles away. No risk of a head-on collision. If he moves RIGHT to (6, 0), we are still safe at (7, 0). If he moves UP or LEFT, we are safe.\n\nMoving LEFT is the most aggressive, scoring, and strategically sound move right now. We must keep pressing the advantage!\n\n### **Rival Prediction & Counterplay**\n\nOpponent is at (5, 0).\n\n*   **If he moves UP to (5, 1):** Good for him, he's escaping the choke. We continue LEFT to (7, 0), eat the apple.\n*   **If he moves RIGHT to (6, 0):** He's moving toward us. We move LEFT to (7, 0), eat the apple. Next turn, he'll be stuck between us at (7, 0) and the boundary/our massive body down South.\n\nOur priority is maintaining the apple lead and securing territory. Moving LEFT achieves both perfectly.\n\n### **Long-term Strategy Note (Next 5 Turns):**\n\nT22: LEFT to (7, 0). [Apple]. Grow to 11. (Current Move)\nT23: LEFT to (6, 0). We are building the wall!\nT24: Check board state. If (5, 0) is still open or an apple is there, go for it! Otherwise, we are looking to move UP to start squeezing him from the outside.\nT25: UP or continue LEFT, depending on opponent's position around (5, 0) and (6, 0). We need to get above the horizontal line that he is operating on.\n\nWe are turning the whole board into our backyard, Chat! Let's get this $W$!\n\nLEFT",

We are absolutely crushing this archrival. Look at the board, fam! We have turned the entire right side into a no-go zone for him!\n\n### **Current State Analysis - Turn 23**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head position: **(7, 0)**. We are long, strong, and ready for more!\n    *   Body length: 11 segments!\n    *   Goal: Box in Snake #0, secure the bottom edge, and then start climbing up to dominate the center.\n\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head position: **(6, 0)**. Wait, what?! He moved RIGHT from (5, 0) to (6, 0)! He's trying to slip past our wall, but he can't! He just voluntarily wedged himself right between our head and the edge!\n    *   Body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0)]. His length is 4. Tiny snack!\n    *   Analysis: He is now sitting at (6, 0). He is completely cornered by our massive body on the right (starting at 7, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0...) and the wall behind him. His only safe moves are UP to (6, 1) or a suicidal LEFT into his own very short body segment at (5, 0). Wait, no, (5, 0) is his body! He cannot move LEFT.\n\nChat, he is TRAPPED! This is the moment! We need to make the move that seals his fate!\n\n### **Danger Assessment & Safe Moves from (7, 0)**\n\nOur current head is at (7, 0). Let's check the four possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 1):** Safe tile. No wall, no body. This is a very strong option to start moving up the board and securing the vertical line.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, -1):** Out of bounds! **DEATH!**\n3.  **RIGHT (to 8, 0):** Into our own body segment. **DEATH!** (The (8, 0) segment is now the head's previous position).\n4.  **LEFT (to 6, 0):** **DANGER!** This is the current head position of Snake #0!\n\n### **The Showdown: (7, 0) vs. (6, 0)**\n\nThe opponent is at (6, 0).\n\n*   **Scenario 1: We move LEFT to (6, 0).**\n    *   If he moves UP to (6, 1): We move into (6, 0), he is now choked from the bottom. Safe for us, dominance established.\n    *   If he moves LEFT to (5, 0): He hits his own body segment at (5, 0)! **ENEMY DEATH!** We move into (6, 0), we are safe, we win the engagement!\n    *   If he stays at (6, 0) (not possible, but for analysis): We execute a simultaneous head-to-head collision. **BOTH DIE!** We don't want this unless we are sure he can't move.\n\nWait, his body is [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0)]. If he is at (6, 0), moving LEFT to (5, 0) is indeed moving into his own body! He cannot do that!\n\n**Therefore, the ONLY moves Snake #0 has from (6, 0) are UP to (6, 1) or RIGHT to (7, 0).**\n\n*   If he moves RIGHT to (7, 0): **HEAD-ON COLLISION! BOTH DIE!** Score is 10 to 2. We are WAY ahead. If both die, we win the entire game by score! This is a viable, high-risk, high-reward move.\n\n*   **If we move UP to (7, 1):**\n    *   If he moves UP to (6, 1): We both live. He is still trapped, but he has room to breathe.\n    *   If he moves RIGHT to (7, 0): He crashes into the space we just left, effectively crashing into our body (which will be at (7, 0) for a brief instant before the tail moves). BUT moves are simultaneous. If he moves to (7, 0) where our head was, he is safe on the tile we just left, and we are safe at (7, 1). We lose the choke opportunity.\n\n### **Aggressive Masterplan: Force the Head-On or the Body Crash**\n\nSince moving UP allows the opponent to survive one more turn by moving UP to (6, 1), we should consider the aggressive option: **LEFT.**\n\nIf we move LEFT to (6, 0):\n1.  **If he moves UP (6, 1):** We secure the wall section (6, 0). We are safe. He is one step closer to being boxed in, forced to rely on the narrow columns (6, 7).\n2.  **If he moves RIGHT (7, 0):** **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Both die. Since our score (10) vastly exceeds his score (2), we win the game immediately!\n3.  **If he moves LEFT (5, 0):** He kills himself into his own body (5, 0). We move into (6, 0). **WE WIN!**\n\nSince the worst direct outcome (LEFT) is a win via score difference (Case 2), and the best outcome (Case 1) is securing immediate territorial dominance, and another outcome (Case 3) is an instant win, moving **LEFT** is the optimal strategy. We are forcing the play!\n\n### **Long-term Strategy Note (Next 5 Turns):**\n\nT23: Move LEFT, forcing the enemy to either suicide, get cornered, or initiate a scoring move (head-on collision).\nT24: If he moved up to (6, 1), we also move up to (7, 1) to maintain the choke, or move UP to secure the apple at (7, 1) and extend north. We are now effectively controlling the horizontal line from x=6 onwards.\n\nTime to apply the pressure, Chat! We are going for the gold!\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re on turn 23 and the rival\u2019s got a dragon-body hugging column 9 with ten apples, so we\u2019re playing chicken with a rich snake\u2014no way we\u2019re trading heads unless we somehow hit 10 apples before a KO. Last turn we were forced to keep low, but now we can pry off that bottom row. Let\u2019s break down the plays: DOWN is off the map, LEFT is into my own tail, and RIGHT lands on (7,0) where his head currently sits\u2014if he tries any cheeky left maneuver with me doing the same, it\u2019s a double KO and I auto-lose because he\u2019s up 10-2. So that leaves me with UP to (6,1), which is empty and gives me fresh air while staying in a strong position near column 6.\n\nPlan note: After moving UP, I want to start weaving around to (5,2) or (6,2) so I can slowly start compressing the space in front of him without committing to a head-on. Keep eyes on how he shifts at the top of column 9 and be ready to trap him between my tail and the wall.\n\nUP",
