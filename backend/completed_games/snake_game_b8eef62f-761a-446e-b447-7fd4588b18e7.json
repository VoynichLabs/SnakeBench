Moving left along the top row (toward x decreasing) will bring you closer to that apple without risking immediate collision with any snake.\n- Why Left over Right: Left keeps you on the top edge with more room to maneuver and progress toward the target apple; Right would stall progress and potentially reduce future options along the edge.\n- Safety considerations: No immediate threat from enemy head-to-head on (6,9) this turn. Your own neck is not in the target cell, and there\u2019s no immediate body collision risk in this move. Enemies are currently far below and unlikely to trap you this turn.\n\nPlan for next turns:\n- After moving to (6,9), continue moving left along the top row to approach (3,9) for the apple, while monitoring enemy moves to avoid potential head-ons or traps.\n- If an opportunity arises to pivot toward other apples (e.g., (6,1) or (2,1)) without risking death, adjust direction accordingly to balance apple gain with safety.\n\nLEFT",
