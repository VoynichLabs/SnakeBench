This gets me to x=6, and the apple at (6, 4) is just 2 squares north from there. This is quite direct.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nThe best apple to target is (6, 4) because:\n- It's relatively close and reachable in just a few moves\n- From (5, 2), moving RIGHT takes me to (6, 2), then UP to (6, 3), then UP again to (6, 4)\n- This gets me my first apple quickly, which is crucial for staying ahead\n\nThe enemy snake at (8, 5) is far enough away that there's no immediate collision risk on this move.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nTarget the apple at (6, 4) first. It's only 2 moves away (RIGHT then UP twice). After collecting it, reassess and potentially move toward the (3, 6)/(4, 6) cluster or the apple at (6, 8). Early apples are critical for gaining an advantage.\n\nRIGHT",

ELIMINATED.\n\n3. **LEFT (5, 5)**: Safe. Moves laterally away from my current apple target. Less efficient but keeps options open.\n\n4. **RIGHT (7, 5)**: Dangerous! The enemy snake #1 is at (8, 5). If I move RIGHT to (7, 5), the enemy is right next to me. They could move LEFT to (7, 5) and we'd collide head-on. Even if they don't, moving RIGHT puts me in a vulnerable position near the enemy. AVOID.\n\n**Collision Analysis:**\n- Enemy at (8, 5) is directly to my right.\n- Moving UP keeps distance and continues toward my apple target.\n- Moving RIGHT risks immediate head-on collision with the enemy.\n\n**Clear Winner:** UP continues my strategic path toward (6, 8) without any collision risk, and it's only 2 moves away now.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\nAfter reaching (6, 8) next turn (move UP), I'll be at (6, 6), then one more UP gets me to (6, 8) for the apple. After that, turn my attention to the cluster of apples at (4, 6) and (3, 6). The enemy snake appears to be stationary or moving slowly, so I can focus on efficient apple collection.\n\nUP",

Moves me left along this row. Takes me away from the immediate apple cluster below but keeps options open.\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 7)**: Valid move. Moves me right, away from the apple cluster. Less strategic.\n\n**Safety Analysis:**\n- UP would be suicide (my own body at (5, 8))\n- DOWN (5, 6) is safe. The enemy at (7, 5) is moving independently and won't collide with me on (5, 6).\n- LEFT (4, 7) is safe and keeps me in the apple zone area\n- RIGHT (6, 7) is safe but moves away from apples\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\nDOWN (5, 6) is the most direct path toward the apple cluster at (4, 6) and (3, 6). From (5, 6), I can then move LEFT to (4, 6) or (3, 6) to collect apples. This maintains momentum toward high-value targets.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n- Turn 10: Move DOWN to (5, 6)\n- Turn 11: Move LEFT to (4, 6) - collect apple\n- Turn 12: Continue LEFT to (3, 6) - collect apple\n- Then reassess for next target\n\nDOWN",
