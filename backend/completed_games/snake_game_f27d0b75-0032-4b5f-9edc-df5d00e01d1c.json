If we continue upward, we risk hitting the wall at (0,9), but since (0,9) is inside the grid, it's safe. But then we face the risk of approaching enemy\u2019s position at (2,9), which is two steps to the right.\n\n- Moving left from (0,8): outside the board, so invalid.\n\n- Moving down from (0,8) to (0,7): safe, brings us closer to apples at (8,1) and (9,6). But (0,7) doesn't have an apple, so this is a safe move to stay alive, but perhaps not the best if we're aiming for apples.\n\n- Moving right from (0,8) to (1,8): interior safe move. This brings us closer to apples at (2,3), (1,3), and more, and avoids enemy at (2,9). Moving right positions us closer to multiple apples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- I want to pursue apples efficiently.\n- The closest apple seems to be at (1,3) or (2,3), which are directly below or slightly to the right.\n- Moving right from (0,8) to (1,8) is safe and brings us closer.\n- Moving down from (0,8) to (0,7) is another safe option but less direct toward apples.\n- Moving up is also safe but less strategic because the apple at (2,3) is below us, and upward movement risks staying put unnecessarily.\n- Moving left isn't valid.\n\nThus, a good move seems to be moving RIGHT to (1,8). This keeps us moving toward the apples at lower y coordinates and avoids immediate threat from enemy at (2,9).\n\nNext turn, I will consider moving towards apples further down but for now, the immediate plan is to move RIGHT.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"
