Apples everywhere but we ignore apples for now \u2014 we want to DOMINATE.\n\nFirst, check all moves for immediate death:\n\nUP \u2192 (4,9) \u2014 inside board, no body there, enemy far away. SAFE.\nDOWN \u2192 (4,7) \u2014 inside board, safe.\nLEFT \u2192 (3,8) \u2014 inside board, safe.\nRIGHT \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 oh wait, that's an apple at (5,8)! But more importantly, it's safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now. No risk of running into enemy body (none) or my body (none).\n\nBut we gotta think about enemy movement. Enemy at (2,2). Where can they go? They can go UP to (2,3), DOWN to (2,1), LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2). All safe for them too.\n\nHead-on collision risk? Only if we pick a move that lands on same cell they move into. They don't know our move. But we're far apart \u2014 no chance this turn.\n\nSo all moves equally safe immediately.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to BOX HIM IN. He's in bottom-left area. We're top-center. We should start moving toward him to cut off his space. Also, we want to grow to have longer body to trap him.\n\nRight now, moving toward him means going DOWN and LEFT generally. But moving toward (2,2) from (4,8) means big distance.\n\nActually, maybe grab an apple early to get length advantage? If we take RIGHT to (5,8), we eat apple, grow to length 2, score 1-0. That gives us advantage for head-on collisions later.\n\nBut moving toward apples might not be the aggressive boxing move. Hmm.\n\nLet's think: If we go RIGHT and eat apple, our body will be at (4,8) and head at (5,8). That's fine. Then next turn we can move toward enemy.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3,8), we're closer to left side but no apple.\n\nActually, being longer helps us win head-on collisions. So maybe get that first apple NOW.\n\nAlso, going RIGHT to (5,8) keeps more options open \u2014 we can go UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT next turn from there.\n\nGoing LEFT to (3,8) also fine.\n\nBut I think early growth is key. Let's take the apple at (5,8).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating, start moving down-left toward enemy, use our longer body to cut off his escape routes. Try to force him into a wall or into us.\n\nAlright chat, we're going for the apple and the early lead! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nFirst, check all moves for immediate death:\n\nUP \u2192 (5,9) \u2014 inside board, no body, enemy far. SAFE.\nDOWN \u2192 (5,7) \u2014 inside board, safe.\nLEFT \u2192 (4,8) \u2014 WAIT! That's my own body segment! That's a crash into myself. ELIMINATE! \u274c\nRIGHT \u2192 (6,8) \u2014 inside board, safe.\n\nSo LEFT is out. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, enemy is at (2,3). Where can they go? They could move UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), RIGHT to (3,3). All safe for them.\n\nHead-on collision risk? We're far apart, no chance this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: We have a length advantage (2 vs 1). We want to use that to pressure and box him in! He's in the bottom-left quadrant. We're top-right area. We should start moving toward him while controlling space.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (6,8), we move away from him, but there's an apple at (6,8)? Wait, looking at board: at row 8, x=6 is '.' actually? Let's check: Board shows at (6,8) is '.'? Actually row 8: . . . A T 0 A . A A \u2014 positions: (0,8) ., (1,8) ., (2,8) ., (3,8) A, (4,8) T (my tail), (5,8) 0 (my head), (6,8) A, (7,8) ., (8,8) A, (9,8) A. So (6,8) is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nSo RIGHT gets us an apple, grow to length 3, score 2-0. More length = more advantage in head-on collisions.\n\nIf we go UP to (5,9), no apple, stays length 2.\nIf we go DOWN to (5,7), no apple, stays length 2.\n\nBut is moving RIGHT away from enemy bad? Maybe, but growing bigger faster lets us dominate later. Also from (6,8) we can go DOWN/LEFT next turn toward enemy.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,7), we're closer to enemy but no growth.\n\nWe should also think about future safe moves: from (6,8) after eating apple, our body will be at (5,8) and (4,8). Then next turn from (6,8), possible moves: UP (6,9) safe, DOWN (6,7) safe, LEFT (5,8) \u2014 that's our body! So LEFT would be unsafe next turn if we go RIGHT now. But we'd have other options.\n\nFrom (5,7) if we go DOWN now, body at (5,8),(4,8). Next turn from (5,7): UP (5,8) body \u2014 unsafe, DOWN (5,6) safe, LEFT (4,7) safe, RIGHT (6,7) safe. So 3 safe options.\n\nFrom (5,9) if we go UP now, body at (5,8),(4,8). Next turn from (5,9): DOWN (5,8) body \u2014 unsafe, UP off board \u2014 unsafe, LEFT (4,9) safe, RIGHT (6,9) safe. Only 2 safe options.\n\nSo UP is risky for future. DOWN gives 3 options. RIGHT gives 3 options (UP,DOWN,RIGHT safe, LEFT unsafe).\n\nI think taking the apple at (6,8) is good \u2014 extend lead, get longer to trap enemy. Then next turn start moving down/left toward him.\n\nAlso, enemy might go for apples near him \u2014 at (3,4), (3,5), (3,2), etc. We want to cut off his space before he grows.\n\nLet's go RIGHT, get that apple, and press the advantage! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

I\u2019m not chasing fruit right now\u2014he\u2019s the one with the lead, so I\u2019m gonna posture aggressively toward the open lanes and keep that corridor tight, ready to cut him off if he starts drifting down.

We have a HUGE size advantage! Let's use it to pressure him early.\n\nFirst, check immediate safety for each move:\n\nUP \u2192 (6,9) \u2014 inside board, empty. SAFE \u2705  \nDOWN \u2192 (6,7) \u2014 inside board, empty. SAFE \u2705  \nLEFT \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 WAIT, that's my own body segment! \u274c CRASH INTO MYSELF. ELIMINATE!  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7,8) \u2014 inside board, empty. SAFE \u2705  \n\nSo LEFT is out. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, enemy at (2,4). He can move UP to (2,5), DOWN to (2,3), LEFT to (1,4), RIGHT to (3,4). All safe for him. No immediate head-on risk\u2014we're far apart.\n\nBut long-term plan: We want to box him in while he's short! He's in bottom-left. We're top-right. We should move toward him to cut off his space and force a trap.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,8), we move slightly away from him, but there's an apple at (8,8) nearby for future. Not ideal for pressure.\n\nIf we go UP to (6,9), we go to top edge\u2014limits options next turn and away from enemy.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (6,7), we move closer to the center and toward enemy! From (6,7), next turn we can go further DOWN/LEFT toward him. That's aggressive!\n\nAlso, think about future safe moves after each:\n\nFrom (6,7):  \nUP \u2192 (6,8) body? Wait, body will be at (6,8)?? Actually after moving DOWN, our new body: head to (6,7), tail stays? We grow only on apples. We didn't eat apple this turn, so length stays 3, body becomes [(6,7), (6,8), (5,8)]. So UP to (6,8) would be our own body next turn\u2014unsafe. But DOWN to (6,6) safe, LEFT to (5,7) safe, RIGHT to (7,7) safe. So 3 safe options.\n\nFrom (7,8): body becomes [(7,8), (6,8), (5,8)]. Next turn from (7,8): UP (7,9) safe, DOWN (7,7) safe, LEFT (6,8) body\u2014unsafe, RIGHT (8,8) safe (apple there). Also 3 safe options.\n\nFrom (6,9): body becomes [(6,9), (6,8), (5,8)]. Next turn from (6,9): DOWN (6,8) body\u2014unsafe, UP off board\u2014unsafe, LEFT (5,9) safe, RIGHT (7,9) safe. Only 2 safe options\u2014risky!\n\nSo UP is bad for future flexibility.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \nDOWN moves us toward enemy and keeps options.  \nRIGHT moves us toward apple at (8,8) next turn but away from enemy.\n\nWe have a size lead\u2014we should press the advantage, not just chase apples. Let's move DOWN to get closer, cut off his escape, and maybe force him into a corner!\n\nPlan for next turns: From (6,7), aim to go LEFT/DOWN toward (2,4) area, use our length to block his paths.\n\nDOWN",

I\u2019d rather set up the trap, not chase the snack.\n\nThe safest, most menacing move is UP \u2014 keeps my follow-up doors open, strengthens my presence over the open center, and lets me shadow his head while sizing up a potential box-in once he commits to a side.\n\nPlan note: Keep eyeballing his next move from the center column, keep creeping upward so I\u2019m aligned with his lane, and be ready to pivot hard once he either drops into the mid lane or starts hugging the wall.

Enemy head at (2,5), still no body\u2014he's tiny! We have a MASSIVE size advantage.

DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nHe's at (2,5). He can go UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5). All safe for him. No immediate head-on collision risk\u2014we're far apart.\n\n**Long-term aggression plan:**  \nWe want to box him in while he's short! He's in the left side. We're center-right. Moving LEFT gets us closer to him directly. Moving DOWN moves us toward center but also slightly away. Moving RIGHT moves us away from him\u2014bad for pressure.\n\nFrom (5,7) if we go LEFT:  \nNext turn we could go further LEFT toward him, or DOWN/UP to cut off his escape routes. We're building a wall with our body!\n\nFrom (6,6) if we go DOWN:  \nWe're more central, but maybe too passive.\n\nFrom (7,7) if we go RIGHT:  \nWe're moving away\u2014letting him breathe.

Wait, check: body will be [(5,7), (6,7), (6,8)]. So (5,8) is empty? Actually (5,8) was our tail at turn 2, but we moved from (6,8) to (6,7), so tail moved? Let's trace:  \nTurn 2: head (6,8), body [(5,8), (4,8)]  \nTurn 3: we move head to (5,7). Body shifts: new head (5,7), then previous head (6,8) becomes segment 2, then (5,8) becomes segment 3? Wait, snake moves: head goes to new cell, each body segment moves into the previous segment's position. So:  \nOld: head (6,8), seg2 (5,8), seg3 (4,8)  \nMove LEFT: new head (5,7)  \nSeg2 becomes old head (6,8)  \nSeg3 becomes old seg2 (5,8)  \nSo body: [(5,7), (6,8), (5,8)]  \nYes! So (5,8) is occupied by our tail. So UP to (5,8) is our own tail\u2014safe? Actually it's our body, so unsafe.  \nDOWN (5,6) safe, LEFT (4,7) safe, RIGHT (6,7) is our body segment (6,8)? Wait (6,7) is empty? Actually (6,7) is now empty because head left it. So RIGHT to (6,7) safe. So 3 safe options.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (6,6):  \nBody: [(6,6), (6,7), (6,8)]  \nNext turn from (6,6):  \nUP (6,7) body\u2014unsafe, DOWN (6,5) safe, LEFT (5,6) safe, RIGHT (7,6) safe. 3 safe options.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,7):  \nBody: [(7,7), (6,7), (6,8)]  \nNext turn from (7,7):  \nUP (7,8) safe, DOWN (7,6) safe, LEFT (6,7) body\u2014unsafe, RIGHT (8,7) safe. 3 safe options.\n\nAll three keep good options. But LEFT advances our positioning toward the enemy\u2014AGGRESSION!\n\n**Strategic note for next turn:**  \nWe're closing in on snake #1. From (5,7), aim to move further LEFT/UP/DOWN to cut off his potential moves. He's at (2,5); we want to get between him and the center. Maybe next turn go LEFT to (4,7) or DOWN to (5,6) to continue pressuring. Avoid letting him get to apples and grow. Use our length to block!\n\nLEFT",

Score\u2019s 0\u20132 so I\u2019m the hungry underdog, but that just means I gotta play the smart, aggressive grind. Every move is loaded with intent\u2014where\u2019s he going next, and how can I start hemming him in?\n\nLet\u2019s break this down:\n\n- **UP (to 2,7)** keeps me centered, keeps the pressure on his lane around x=5, and leaves me with escape routes left, right, and even future upward pushes. He\u2019s cramped between the wall and his own body segments, so staying close while he tries to reroute I can bait him into a predictable lane. Keeps the fight tight, and I can pivot into a head-on if he panics.\n\n- **DOWN (to 2,5)** would put me drifting toward the apples I\u2019m not focused on, and it shrinks my vertical real estate\u2014less room to dance, more chance he sneaks around me. No thanks, I\u2019m not giving him a corridor to run in.\n\n- **LEFT (to 1,6)** hugs the wall, which might seem cozy, but that\u2019s a trap I\u2019m literally avoiding. Walls limit options and help him trap me if I start hugging that edge. I\u2019m playing the board center-right now.\n\n- **RIGHT (to 3,6)** edges toward a juicy apple at (3,5), but also puts me just one step away from his current lane while not actually pressuring anything. I\u2019d rather keep my hand on the throttle and stay aligned with him instead of chasing fluff.\n\nSo the move that keeps me dangerous and flexible is **UP**\u2014maintain the mid-column fight, keep tying up his exits, and let him sweat while I\u2019m still got open avenues.\n\nPlan note: Stay on column x=2, keep shading his top-right quadrant, and once he commits to a direction I\u2019ll cut him off with a curved loop; gotta stay tall and pressure those exits before I go for a head-on.\n\nUP",

ELIMINATE!\n\nSo RIGHT is out. UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nHe's at (2,6). He can go UP (2,7), DOWN (2,5), LEFT (1,6), RIGHT (3,6). All safe for him. No immediate collision risk \u2014 we're far apart.\n\n**AGGRESSION PLAN:**  \nWe want to BOX HIM IN while he's short! Moving LEFT to (4,7) gets us CLOSER to him \u2014 cutting off his right side! Moving UP to (5,8) moves us away slightly. Moving DOWN to (5,6) is neutral.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY AFTER EACH MOVE:**\n\nIf we go UP to (5,8):  \nNew body: [(5,8), (5,7), (6,7)]  \nNext turn from (5,8):  \nUP (5,9) safe, DOWN (5,7) body \u2014 unsafe, LEFT (4,8) safe, RIGHT (6,8) safe. 3 safe options.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,6):  \nNew body: [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]  \nNext turn from (5,6):  \nUP (5,7) body \u2014 unsafe, DOWN (5,5) safe, LEFT (4,6) safe, RIGHT (6,6) safe. 3 safe options.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,7):  \nNew body: [(4,7), (5,7), (6,7)]  \nNext turn from (4,7):  \nUP (4,8) safe, DOWN (4,6) safe, LEFT (3,7) safe, RIGHT (5,7) body \u2014 unsafe. 3 safe options.\n\nAll three keep good options. But LEFT advances us TOWARD THE ENEMY \u2014 we're building a WALL with our body! We want to trap him against the left edge! From (4,7), next turn we can go further LEFT to (3,7) or DOWN/UP to cut off his escape. He's at (2,6) \u2014 we're closing in!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nKeep pressing LEFT/DOWN to get between enemy and center. If he moves toward apples on left side, we can block. Use our length to limit his space. Avoid letting him grow. If he stays tiny, we can force a head-on collision when we have length advantage! \ud83d\udea8\n\nLEFT",

He might choose RIGHT to (3,8) to avoid? That also avoids collision.  \nHmm \u2014 maybe he avoids collision either way. But if we go UP, we're closer to top wall, limiting his space. If we go LEFT, we're closer to left wall.  \nI think UP is more aggressive \u2014 we go towards him and the top wall, cornering him.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY AFTER EACH MOVE:**\n\nIf we go UP to (3,8):  \nNew body: [(3,8), (3,7), (4,7)]  \nNext turn from (3,8): UP (3,9) safe, DOWN (3,7) body \u2014 unsafe, LEFT (2,8) \u2014 that's enemy's CURRENT head, but he'll move, so likely empty next turn?

Possibly safe. DOWN (2,6) safe, LEFT (1,7) safe, RIGHT (3,7) body \u2014 unsafe. 3 safe options likely.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nWe're hunting a single-head snake! Keep pressing him against walls. Use our length to cut off escape routes. If we can force a head-on collision while we have higher score, TAKE IT \u2014 instant win!

Do we take it?  \nI say YES \u2014 GO FOR THE THROAT!

Possibly safe. RIGHT (3,8) body \u2014 unsafe. 3 safe options likely.\n\nIf we go UP to (3,9):  \nNew body: [(3,9), (3,8), (3,7)]  \nNext turn from (3,9): UP off board \u2014 unsafe, DOWN (3,8) body \u2014 unsafe, LEFT (2,9) safe, RIGHT (4,9) safe. Only 2 safe options \u2014 risky!

Keep pressing him against walls. Use our length to cut off escape routes. If we can force a head-on collision while we have higher score, TAKE IT \u2014 instant win! Next turn, if we're at (2,8) and he's at (1,8) or (0,8), we can go LEFT to (1,8) to threaten. Keep the pressure! Don't let him breathe! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**DECISION:**  \nLEFT forces him towards the left wall and threatens immediate head-on win if he goes right.

The opponent head is at (1,7) in the board state, but in the \"OPPONENTS\" list it says Head: (1,7), Body: none. So he's at (1,7) now. My head is at (2,8). He just moved UP from (1,8) to (1,7)? No \u2014 last turn he was at (1,8) according to my last rationale, and I moved LEFT to (2,8). Now he's at (1,7). That means he moved DOWN to (1,7)!

Higher score wins in a head-on? Wait \u2014 rules: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" Then if both die, game ends and snake with more apples wins. That's us! So forcing head-on while we have higher apples is a WIN!  \nIf I go LEFT to (1,8) and he goes UP to (1,8), also head-on.  \nIf I go UP to (2,9), no immediate collision risk.\n\n**AGGRESSION PLAN:**  \nHe's running DOWN/LEFT probably. We want to CUT HIM OFF and force him into a corner! If we go DOWN to (2,7), we block his RIGHT escape and threaten head-on if he goes right. If he goes LEFT to (0,7) or DOWN to (1,6), we can chase.  \nBut CHAT \u2014 think about this: If we go LEFT to (1,8), we're above him. That might push him further down toward bottom wall. If we go DOWN to (2,7), we're to his right, pushing him left against wall.  \nWe have length advantage \u2014 we can use our body to limit his space. Our body is at (3,8), (3,7), (4,7) \u2014 that's a block to our right side.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY AFTER EACH MOVE:**\n\nIf we go DOWN to (2,7):  \nNew body: [(2,7), (2,8), (3,8)] (tail at (3,7) disappears because no apple).  \nNext turn from (2,7): UP (2,8) body \u2014 unsafe, DOWN (2,6) safe, LEFT (1,7) enemy's current head (but he'll move), RIGHT (3,7) safe.

Likely 2 safe options.\n\nIf we go UP to (2,9):  \nNew body: [(2,9), (2,8), (3,8)]  \nNext turn from (2,9): UP off board \u2014 unsafe, DOWN (2,8) body \u2014 unsafe, LEFT (1,9) safe, RIGHT (3,9) safe. Only 2 safe options \u2014 risky near top wall.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nWe're hunting him! Force him against the left or bottom wall. If we go DOWN to (2,7), we're positioned to go LEFT next turn to (1,7) if he moves down/left, continuing the pressure. A head-on collision while we have higher score is an instant win \u2014 so if we can predict his move and match it, take it! Keep him cornered! Don't let him get to open space! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**DECISION:**  \nDOWN to (2,7) threatens immediate head-on if he goes RIGHT, and pushes him leftward toward the wall.

That leaves LEFT hitting (0,6) and DOWN to (1,5), both keeping us alive, but I\u2019m going LEFT to snag the apple, stay glued to the west wall, and keep multiple exits open while he\u2019s forced to dance around columns 1\u20132 and can\u2019t safely take a head-on.\n\nPlan note: keep drifting south along the left wall, keep my body compact, and force him to chase me eastward so he eventually traps himself while I still have room to spiral away. You think he can slip through when we\u2019re boxing him like this?? \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

The enemy is on the run!\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**  \nMy head now at (2,7) after moving DOWN last turn. My body: [(2,8), (3,8), (3,7)] \u2014 wait, that\u2019s 3 body segments plus head? Actually, I have 3 apples \u2192 length 4. Head (2,7), then (2,8), (3,8), (3,7) as tail. Yes!  \nEnemy head at (1,6) \u2014 he moved DOWN from (1,7) last turn! He\u2019s fleeing toward the bottom-left corner!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (2,7):**\n\nUP \u2192 (2,8) \u2014 That\u2019s my own body segment! \u274c CRASH INTO MYSELF! ELIMINATE!  \nDOWN \u2192 (2,6) \u2014 Empty! \u2705 SAFE  \nLEFT \u2192 (1,7) \u2014 Empty! \u2705 SAFE  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3,7) \u2014 That\u2019s my tail! But tails move after heads \u2014 careful! Since no apple eaten last turn, my tail at (3,7) will move away this turn (to (3,8)? Wait, tail follows path). Actually, simultaneous movement: at the start of this turn, my tail is at (3,7). If I move RIGHT into (3,7), that\u2019s moving into my own body segment that hasn\u2019t moved yet this turn \u2014 THAT\u2019S A CRASH! \u274c ELIMINATE!  \nSo only DOWN and LEFT are safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nHe\u2019s at (1,6). He can go UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6). All are empty for him.  \nHe\u2019s probably avoiding me \u2014 likely DOWN or LEFT away from my head at (2,7).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION OPPORTUNITY?**  \nIf I go DOWN to (2,6) and he goes RIGHT to (2,6) \u2192 HEAD-ON! I have 4 segments (score 3 apples) vs his 1 segment (score 0). Higher apples wins if both die \u2014 that\u2019s an INSTANT WIN! \ud83c\udfc6  \nIf I go LEFT to (1,7) and he goes UP to (1,7) \u2192 also head-on! Same win condition.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE BOXING PLAN:**  \nWe want to force him into a corner! He\u2019s near bottom-left. If we go LEFT to (1,7), we\u2019re above him, maybe pushing him down against bottom wall at y=0.  \nIf we go DOWN to (2,6), we\u2019re to his right, pushing him left against left wall at x=0.  \nWhich is better? Look at the board: bottom row has apples at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6) \u2014 lots of apples there! If he goes down, he might eat and grow, making him harder to kill. We want to deny him apples!  \nGoing LEFT to (1,7) blocks him from going UP, but he can still go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT.  \nGoing DOWN to (2,6) blocks him from going RIGHT, and if he goes DOWN to (1,5), we can chase.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY AFTER EACH MOVE:**\n\nIf we go DOWN to (2,6):  \nNew body: [(2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8)] (tail (3,7) disappears).  \nNext turn from (2,6): UP (2,7) body \u2014 unsafe, DOWN (2,5) safe, LEFT (1,6) enemy\u2019s current head (he\u2019ll move), RIGHT (3,6) safe. Likely 2 safe options unless he stays.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (1,7):  \nNew body: [(1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8)]  \nNext turn from (1,7): UP (1,8) safe, DOWN (1,6) enemy\u2019s current head, LEFT (0,7) safe, RIGHT (2,7) body \u2014 unsafe. Likely 2 safe options.\n\nBoth give similar future flexibility.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nWe want to FORCE the head-on if possible! Which move is more likely to cause head-on?  \nIf he\u2019s scared, he\u2019ll move AWAY from me. From (1,6), my head is at (2,7) \u2014 that\u2019s DOWN-RIGHT from him. He might move DOWN or LEFT.  \nIf I go DOWN to (2,6), I\u2019m moving to his RIGHT side \u2014 he might move LEFT to avoid, not RIGHT into me.  \nIf I go LEFT to (1,7), I\u2019m moving to his UP side \u2014 he might move DOWN to avoid, not UP into me.  \nHmm\u2026 but if he moves randomly, both have equal chance?  \nActually, think: He has no body, so he\u2019s nimble. He might go toward apples! Apples at (0,5),(0,6) are near him. He might go LEFT to (0,6) or DOWN to (1,5) toward (2,0) apple?  \nIf he goes LEFT to (0,6), and I go LEFT to (1,7), no collision. If he goes DOWN to (1,5), and I go DOWN to (2,6), no collision.  \nBut if he goes RIGHT to (2,6) while I go DOWN to (2,6) \u2014 COLLISION! Is he likely to go RIGHT? Possibly if he wants to go toward center.  \nI think DOWN to (2,6) is more aggressive \u2014 it cuts off his right escape and sets up a potential chase downward. Also, if he goes RIGHT, we WIN!  \n\n**LET\u2019S GO FOR THE THROAT! DOWN to (2,6) and hope he goes RIGHT for the instant win! If not, we continue boxing him toward the left wall!** \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

So 3 safe options.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nLEFT (1,6) offers a chance at instant win if he goes RIGHT into us! He might not, but it's the only move that pressures him directly.  \nAlso, going LEFT cuts off his main escape route (right) and keeps him pinned to the wall.  \nDOWN or RIGHT give more future safe moves but let him breathe.\n\nWe're playing to WIN, not just survive! Let's force the issue! If he dodges, we still have him cornered. Next turn we can move to (1,5) or (1,7) to further restrict him.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nIf we go LEFT to (1,6) and he moves UP/DOWN, next turn we move to block his remaining exits. If he's at (0,7), we go to (1,7) to block down. If he's at (0,5), we go to (1,5) to block up. Squeeze him against the wall until he crashes!\n\nLEFT",
