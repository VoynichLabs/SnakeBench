Enemy snake (ID 0) is at (7, 7).\nApples are at: (8, 6), (6, 8), (9, 4), (3, 1), (5, 4).\n\nMy immediate goal is to eat an apple and establish a presence on the board.\n\nLet's evaluate the four possible moves from (4, 6):\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 7):** Safe. Moves me one step closer to (6, 8) and (8, 6) is diagonally far, but still an option.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 5):** Safe. Moves me one step closer to (5, 4).\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 6):** Safe. Doesn't immediately approach any close apples.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 6):** Safe. Moves me one step closer to (8, 6).\n\nAnalyzing proximity to apples:\n*   (4, 6) to (8, 6): Manhattan distance 4. Right gets me to (5, 6), distance 3.\n*   (4, 6) to (6, 8): Manhattan distance $2+2=4$. Up or Right reduces distance somewhat. Right to (5, 6) -> distance 3+2=5. Up to (4, 7) -> distance 2+1=3. UP is better for this apple.\n*   (4, 6) to (5, 4): Manhattan distance $1+2=3$. Down to (4, 5) -> distance 1+1=2. Right to (5, 6) -> distance 0+2=2. Both DOWN and RIGHT are good for this apple.\n\nThe closest apples are (5, 4) (distance 3) and (8, 6) (distance 4), (6, 8) (distance 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake #0 at (7, 7). It could go:\n*   UP (7, 8): Closer to (6, 8).\n*   DOWN (7, 6): Closer to (8, 6).\n*   LEFT (6, 7): Closer to (6, 8).\n*   RIGHT (8, 7): Closer to (8, 6).\n\nIf Snake #0 goes LEFT to (6, 7) or UP to (7, 8), it targets (6, 8).\nIf Snake #0 goes DOWN to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 7), it targets (8, 6).\n\nApple (8, 6) seems highly contested by Snake #0. If I go RIGHT to (5, 6), I'm getting closer, but so is Snake #0 (e.g., if it goes DOWN to (7, 6)).\n\nApple (6, 8) is also contested. If I go UP to (4, 7), I'm at distance 3. Snake #0 moving UP (7, 8) is distance 1 from (6, 8)'s column, distance 2 overall. Snake #0 moving LEFT (6, 7) is distance 1 from (6, 8)'s row, distance 1 overall. Snake #0 can reach (6, 8) sooner than I can.\n\nApple (5, 4) is relatively safe from Snake #0, as it's far away (distance $2+3=5$ for Snake #0).\n\nIf I choose DOWN to (4, 5), I move one step closer to (5, 4) (distance 2).\nIf I choose RIGHT to (5, 6), I also move one step closer to (5, 4) (distance 2).\n\nLet's stick to the relatively uncontested apple (5, 4).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 5):\nNext turn I could move RIGHT to (5, 5), then DOWN to (5, 4) (eat). Total 2 turns to eat.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 6):\nNext turn I could move DOWN to (5, 5), then DOWN to (5, 4) (eat). Total 2 turns to eat.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead to eating (5, 4) in 2 turns, assuming no obstacles.\n\nThe coordinates (4, 6) are central. Moving DOWN pulls me away from the top-right corner where Snake 0 is, reducing immediate conflict risk. Moving RIGHT keeps me somewhat in the center but slightly closer to the horizontal line of conflict (y=6).\n\nI will choose DOWN to (4, 5). This keeps options open for the next move (RIGHT to (5, 5) or DOWN to (4, 4)). It prioritizes the apple (5, 4) which is safer from the opponent.\n\nMy path to (5, 4):\nT0: (4, 6) -> DOWN -> (4, 5)\nT1: (4, 5) -> RIGHT -> (5, 5)\nT2: (5, 5) -> DOWN -> (5, 4) (EAT)\n\nAlternative path if I chose RIGHT:\nT0: (4, 6) -> RIGHT -> (5, 6)\nT1: (5, 6) -> DOWN -> (5, 5)\nT2: (5, 5) -> DOWN -> (5, 4) (EAT)\n\nSince both yield the same result in 2 turns, I prefer DOWN as it moves away from the enemy's general direction (7, 7).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Secure (5, 4), then re-evaluate based on opponent movement and apple depletion. (3, 1) is the next closest uncontested apple (distance 5 from (5, 4)).\n\nDOWN",

Regardless of its exact move (e.g., if it moves to (6, 7) or (7, 8)), it is not immediately threatening my movement towards the center-left.\n\nLong-term plan starting Turn 3: Move towards (3, 3).\nFrom (5, 4), the path to (3, 3) is LEFT twice, then DOWN once (or permutations thereof).\n\nMove plan for Turn 2: DOWN.\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nTurn 3 Goal: Move towards the apple at (3, 3).

Since (6, 8) is its body/tail, it is highly unlikely to move there unless it has no other option, or if the rules allow moving onto the tail when not eating (which is usually safe, resulting in the snake moving forward one cell and the tail vacating the previous position). Let's assume standard rules where moving onto your own tail is safe unless you haven't eaten, or if you are moving directly backward. Since it's length 2, its immediately previous position was (6, 8). Moving to (6, 8) is moving onto its body. Let's assume hitting one's body (even just the tail) is lethal unless the snake grows.\n\n*   If Snake #0 moved UP/RIGHT/DOWN to (7, 9), (8, 8), or (7, 7), it stays far away.\n*   If Snake #0 moved LEFT to (6, 8), it hits its own body/tail and dies (assuming standard snake rules where moving backward into your 2-length body is lethal).\n\nGiven Snake #0's current position (far away), proximity threats are minimal.\n\n**Candidate Moves from (5, 4):**\n\n| Move | Destination | Collision Check | Own Body/Tail Check | Rationale |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **UP** | (5, 5) | Safe. | **Hits body segment (5, 5)! IMMEDIATE DANGER.** | **LETHAL** (Moving directly backward into my own L=2 body). |\n| **DOWN** | (5, 3) | Safe. | Safe. | Moves towards (3, 3). M=2. |\n| **LEFT** | (4, 4) | Safe. | Safe. | Moves towards (3, 3). M=2. |\n| **RIGHT** | (6, 4) | Safe. | Safe. | Moves away from (3, 3). M=4. |\n\n**Crucial Elimination:** Moving UP to (5, 5) is moving exactly onto the segment immediately behind the head. With a length of 2, this segment is also the tail, and moving into it is a classic backward self-collision kill. **UP is lethal.**\n\n### 2. Strategic Move Selection\n\nWe are left with DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. We want to get to (3, 3) (M=3).\n\n1.  **LEFT to (4, 4):** Distance to (3, 3) is M=2. Path is clear. Keeps flexibility.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 3):** Distance to (3, 3) is M=2. Path is clear. Keeps flexibility.\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Distance to (3, 3) is M=4. Moves away.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are equally good for distance reduction (M=2 to target (3, 3)).\n\nChoosing **LEFT** (to 4, 4) seems slightly better as it positions the snake more centrally on the board and closer to the x-coordinate of the target (3, 3). If I move DOWN, I might block the access to apple (3, 1) later if I become long, but for now, (4, 4) sets up a clean path for the next move (either down to 4, 3 or left to 3, 4, followed by the respective move to reach 3, 3).\n\nLet's maintain the planned path: LEFT.\n\n### 3. Future Planning (Turn 4)\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 4), my body will be at (5, 4).\nNext move from (4, 4) to reach (3, 3):\nOptions are LEFT to (3, 4) (M=1), or DOWN to (4, 3) (M=2). Moving LEFT sets up the final move DOWN to (3, 3). This seems very safe and direct.\n\nMovement sequence: (5, 4) -> (4, 4) [LEFT] -> (3, 4) [LEFT] -> (3, 3) [DOWN].\n\nThis path looks solid for eating the next apple safely.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nTurn 4 Goal: Move towards (3, 3). From (4, 4), move LEFT to (3, 4).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

(Enemy is still far in the upper right.)\n\n### 1. Safety Check and Move Evaluation\n\nMy head is at (3, 1). My immediate body segment is (3, 2).\n\n**Closest Apples:**\n1. (1, 3): Manhattan distance 4. (My intended target from the previous plan.)\n2. (8, 1): Manhattan distance 5. (To the right)\n3. (8, 2): Manhattan distance 6. (To the right)\n4. (6, 7): Manhattan distance 9.\n5. (9, 4): Manhattan distance 9.\n\nThe strategic goal is to move towards the apple at (1, 3).

Good setup. |\n| **RIGHT**| (4, 1) | Safe. | Moves away from (1, 3), but towards (8, 1). |\n\n### 2. Strategic Move Selection\n\nThe move UP is lethal (self-collision), and DOWN is lethal (wall collision).\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Targeting (1, 3):**\nMoving LEFT to (2, 1) is a direct step towards (1, 3).\nFrom (2, 1), I will next likely move LEFT to (1, 1).\n\n**Targeting (8, 1):**\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 1) starts the movement toward the apples at (8, 1) and (8, 2). This is also a viable option, as (8, 1) is only distance 5.\n\nLet's compare the paths:\n1. **To (1, 3) (M=4):** Left (2, 1), Left (1, 1), Up (1, 2), Up (1, 3). This path seems very open and safe.\n2. **To (8, 1) (M=5):** Right (4, 1), Right (5, 1), Right (6, 1), Right (7, 1), Right (8, 1). This is longer and means traversing empty space near the bottom border.\n\nSince (1, 3) is slightly closer and the path involves multiple turns (making it easy to avoid congestion, even though there is no congestion now), **LEFT** seems preferable to maintain momentum towards the planned target.\n\nThere are no immediate threats from Snake #0, which is still far away in the upper right quadrant (Head at (9, 5)).\n\n**Selected Move: LEFT**\n\n### 3. Future Planning (Turn 9)\n\nIf I move LEFT, my head will be at (2, 1). My body will now be [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] (tail segment (3, 4) vanishes since no apple was eaten).\n\nTurn 9 Head: (2, 1)\nTurn 9 Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\nTarget: (1, 3)\n\nNext move from (2, 1) should be LEFT to (1, 1), continuing towards (1, 3). Safety needs to be checked against my body (3, 1) and surrounding walls/enemies.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nTurn 9 Goal: Continue progress towards apple (1, 3). Move LEFT to (1, 1).\nTurn 10 Goal: Move UP towards (1, 3).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

That's 2 steps to apple (1, 3).)\n\nSince both are equally fast, I choose the move that keeps my flow pattern simplest and maintains momentum towards the target. Moving LEFT places me directly below the required column.\n\nThere are no immediate threats from Snake #0, which is currently at (9, 4). Head-on collision is impossible.\n\n**Selected Move: LEFT.**\n\n### 3. Future Planning (Turn 10)\n\nIf I move LEFT, my head will be at (1, 1).

I should then proceed toward (6, 7) or the cluster (8, 1), (8, 2). Since S0 is targeting (8, 1)/(8, 2), going towards (6, 7) might be safer, but the reward cluster is high.

E0 will most likely move towards (5, 3).\n\n*   If E0 targets (5, 3): (8, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3). (5 moves).\n*   If E0 targets (4, 6): (8, 1) -> (7, 1) ... (too long)\n\nMy path to (2, 4) is completely uncontested.\n\n### 4. Move Selection\n\nMoving UP to (0, 4) is safe and the direct next step in the existing plan to capture the apple at (2, 4).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nTurn 13 Goal: Move UP towards (2, 4). (0, 3) -> (0, 4).\nTurn 14 Goal: Move RIGHT towards (2, 4). (0, 4) -> (1, 4).\nTurn 15 Goal: Move RIGHT to (2, 4) and eat the apple.\nAfter (2, 4), target (4, 6) or (5, 3). (4, 6) is distance 4, (5, 3) is distance 5. (4, 6) seems better for moving up the board.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",
