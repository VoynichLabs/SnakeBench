From the given, the only occupied cells in row 9 are at (4,9) (enemy snake) and (6,9), which isn't marked explicitly, but the only obstacle in row 9 is at (4,9). Therefore, (7,9) appears empty.  \n\nIs moving UP to (7,9) safe?  \nYes, it seems safe, no immediate obstacle or enemy in that cell.\n\nWhat about potential apples?  \n- Apples are at (6,1), (7,3), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,6).  \n- So, moving there doesn't immediately ensure collection, but moving upward now keeps options open for future moves toward apples that are vertically and horizontally reachable.\n\nStrategically, moving upward seems sound, especially because moving down or left might lead to dead ends or collisions with walls or other snakes.\n\nNext turn: I will move UP.",
