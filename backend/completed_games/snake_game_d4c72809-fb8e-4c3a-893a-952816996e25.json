With the apple consumed, the new body configuration would be [(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)].\n3. **Movement Options:** From (8, 5), the next possible moves are:\n   - **UP to (8, 6):** Not valid (snake's body).\n   - **DOWN to (8, 4):** Valid move.\n   - **LEFT to (7, 5):** Valid move.\n   - **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Valid move.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\n- Since the apple at (5, 1) to the south (after potentially moving down to (8, 4)) is available, my trajectory could take that direction. However, I'd then also need to take into consideration the enemy snake's proximity and potential movement.\n- Moving down will allow me to pursue the apple at (4, 2) subsequently. I should avoid conflicts with my own body.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMy strategy is to move an apple further down toward (8, 4) or consider left/right moves that might also set me up optimally to navigate towards the potential apples while avoiding conflicts.\n\n**I will move:** DOWN (to consume the apple at (8, 5))."
