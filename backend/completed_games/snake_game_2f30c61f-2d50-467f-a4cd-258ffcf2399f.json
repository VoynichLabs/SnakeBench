Apples everywhere but we ignore for now \u2014 gotta think about positioning and aggression early!\n\nFirst, check all four moves for immediate death:\n\n- UP to (4,6): empty, in bounds \u2705  \n- DOWN to (4,4): empty, in bounds \u2705  \n- LEFT to (3,5): empty, in bounds \u2705  \n- RIGHT to (5,5): empty, in bounds \u2705  \n\nAll moves safe \u2014 no body anywhere yet. Enemy head is far top-left, so no immediate collision risk unless he moves toward me fast.\n\nBut we gotta think long-term: enemy at (1,9) \u2014 he could go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (UP off board). Most likely he'll go DOWN or LEFT toward center/apples. If I move UP, I go toward top half, maybe cut him off later. If I move RIGHT, I go toward right side apples but maybe give him space.\n\nI want to control the board center and pressure him early. Moving UP to (4,6) puts me closer to top apples and maybe box him from below if he comes down. Moving LEFT toward (3,5) gets me closer to his side but maybe too aggressive turn 1 with no body.\n\nActually, let's think about future safe moves:  \nFrom (4,6), next turn I\u2019d have UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT likely all open unless enemy moves into one.  \nFrom (4,4), similar.  \nFrom (3,5), still good.  \nFrom (5,5), also fine.\n\nBut I want to dominate \u2014 so maybe move UP to claim top-center early and keep options open. Also, apples at (4,7) and (2,7) are near top \u2014 moving UP sets up potential eats next turn.\n\nEnemy might go DOWN to (1,8) or LEFT to (0,9). Either way, distance stays big this turn.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**  \n- After moving UP, look to either grab apple at (4,7) or (2,7) if safe.  \n- Watch enemy movement \u2014 if he moves toward left wall, consider cutting off his escape by moving left next.  \n- Start growing to get longer than him so we can force head-on collisions later when we have length advantage.  \n- Keep center control, don\u2019t get pinned to edges early.\n\nAlright chat, we're going UP to take control! \ud83d\ude0e\u2b06\ufe0f\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let\u2019s assess the board after that last turn! \ud83d\ude24\n\nWe\u2019re at (4,7) with body at (4,6). Enemy is at (2,8) with no body yet. We have 1 apple, enemy has 0. We\u2019re longer \u2014 that\u2019s an advantage in head-on collisions now! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nFirst, check all moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (4,8): empty \u2705  \n- **DOWN** to (4,6): our own body \u274c \u2014 DEATH! Can\u2019t go backwards into our tail.  \n- **LEFT** to (3,7): empty \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** to (5,7): empty \u2705  \n\nSo DOWN is out. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow think about enemy\u2019s possible moves from (2,8):  \nHe can go UP (2,9) \u2014 off board? Wait, y=9 is top row, so (2,9) is off board \u2014 so UP is suicide for him. He won\u2019t do that unless he\u2019s throwing.  \nHe can go DOWN to (2,7) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nLEFT to (1,8) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nRIGHT to (3,8) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n\nSo likely he goes DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nWe want to pressure him while staying safe. If we go UP to (4,8), we\u2019re moving away from him \u2014 gives him space. If we go LEFT to (3,7), we\u2019re closer to him horizontally. If we go RIGHT to (5,7), we\u2019re moving away.\n\nBut also think about apples: there\u2019s an apple at (4,3) but far, apple at (2,7) \u2014 that\u2019s right below enemy! If he goes DOWN he gets it and grows to length 2, tying our length. We don\u2019t want that.\n\nMaybe we can cut him off from that apple? From (3,7), we could next turn go DOWN to (3,6) or LEFT to (2,7) \u2014 but (2,7) is where the apple is. If he goes DOWN this turn, he\u2019ll be at (2,7) with apple, grow, and his body will be at (2,8). Then if we go to (2,7) next turn, we\u2019d collide with his body \u2014 death. So we can\u2019t contest that apple directly unless we get there same turn as him (head-on collision). But we\u2019re longer \u2014 head-on collision now means he dies, we survive! \ud83d\ude08\n\nSo if we think he\u2019ll go DOWN for the apple, we could go LEFT to (3,7) this turn, then next turn go LEFT again to (2,7) if he\u2019s there \u2014 but wait, he\u2019d be at (2,7) this turn, so next turn he moves away from (2,7) (since he ate apple, his tail stays at (2,8)? Actually, when you eat apple, you grow at end of turn, so next turn his body will be at (2,8) and head moves somewhere. So (2,7) will be empty next turn? Let\u2019s check: If he moves DOWN to (2,7) this turn, he eats apple, grows, so his body becomes [(2,7), (2,8)] head to tail. Next turn his head moves, body shifts, so (2,7) becomes his body segment, (2,8) becomes tail. So (2,7) will be his body next turn \u2014 so we can\u2019t move into it.\n\nHmm. But if we go LEFT to (3,7) now, then next turn we could go DOWN to (3,6) or UP to (3,8) etc. That\u2019s fine.\n\nBut maybe better: go RIGHT to (5,7) to control more space, stay central, avoid early confrontation until we\u2019re longer? But we\u2019re already longer! We should use that to pressure.\n\nActually, risky play: go LEFT to (3,7). If he goes RIGHT to (3,8), we\u2019re adjacent vertically. Could set up head-on next turn if we both move into same cell. But since we\u2019re longer, we win head-on. So that\u2019s good for us.\n\nLet\u2019s check each of our safe moves for future safe moves:\n\nFrom (4,8): next turn can go UP (off board \u274c), DOWN (to 4,7 \u2014 our body will be at 4,7? Wait our body now is (4,6) and head at (4,7). After moving to (4,8), body becomes [(4,8),(4,7),(4,6)]? No \u2014 we didn\u2019t eat apple, so length stays 2: head to (4,8), tail at (4,6), body at (4,7). So next turn from (4,8):  \nUP to (4,9) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nDOWN to (4,7) \u2014 our body \u274c  \nLEFT to (3,8) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nRIGHT to (5,8) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nFrom (3,7): body becomes [(3,7),(4,7),(4,6)]? Wait, we move head to (3,7), body shifts: segment1 at (4,7), segment2 at (4,6). So next turn from (3,7):  \nUP to (3,8) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nDOWN to (3,6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nLEFT to (2,7) \u2014 maybe enemy body if he goes DOWN? Possibly risky.  \nRIGHT to (4,7) \u2014 our body \u274c  \nSo at least 2 safe moves guaranteed.\n\nFrom (5,7): body becomes [(5,7),(4,7),(4,6)]. Next turn from (5,7):  \nUP to (5,8) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nDOWN to (5,6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nLEFT to (4,7) \u2014 our body \u274c  \nRIGHT to (6,7) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nSo 3 safe moves.\n\nAll have decent options.\n\nBut we want to be aggressive \u2014 we have length advantage. Let\u2019s try to force enemy into bad spot. If we go LEFT to (3,7), we\u2019re closer to him. If he goes DOWN for apple, we can\u2019t intercept this turn, but we can maybe trap him against wall later. If he goes RIGHT to (3,8), we\u2019re directly below him \u2014 could go UP next turn for potential head-on if he goes DOWN.\n\nI think LEFT is the aggressive, controlling move. RIGHT is safer but gives him room. UP is safe but passive.\n\nWe\u2019re here to dominate! Let\u2019s pressure early. \ud83d\ude24\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n- After moving LEFT to (3,7), watch where enemy goes.  \n- If he goes DOWN and eats apple, he\u2019ll be length 2 same as us \u2014 then head-on collisions are double KO (equal length). So avoid head-on then.  \n- If he doesn\u2019t eat apple, we keep length advantage \u2014 look to force head-on.  \n- Try to steer him toward top wall or left wall to limit his moves.\n\nAlright chat, we\u2019re going in! LEFT to pressure! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let's break it down! \ud83d\ude24\n\nOur head at (3,7), body at (4,7). Enemy head at (2,7), body at (2,8). We're both length 2 now \u2014 equal apples! Head-on collision would be double KO now \u2014 not good unless we have a clear advantage later.\n\nFirst, check moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (3,8): empty \u2705  \n- **DOWN** to (3,6): empty \u2705  \n- **LEFT** to (2,7): enemy head this turn \u2014 but simultaneous move means if we go LEFT and he stays still or moves into us, possible head-on collision. Since equal length, that's mutual death \u274c too risky!  \n- **RIGHT** to (4,7): our own body \u274c DEATH.\n\nSo LEFT is risky (possible head-on), RIGHT is suicide. UP and DOWN are safe.\n\nNow think about enemy's possible moves from (2,7):  \nHe can go UP to (2,8) \u2014 his own body \u274c  \nDOWN to (2,6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nLEFT to (1,7) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nRIGHT to (3,7) \u2014 our head currently, but if we move away, it's empty. But if we go UP or DOWN, (3,7) becomes our body segment after moving? Wait, after we move, our old head (3,7) becomes body? No \u2014 if we move UP to (3,8), our body becomes [(3,8), (3,7), (4,7)? Actually length 2: head to (3,8), tail at (4,7). So (3,7) is empty next turn. So enemy could go RIGHT to (3,7) safely if we leave.\n\nBut we care about simultaneous moves this turn: if enemy goes RIGHT to (3,7) and we go LEFT to (2,7), head-on collision at (2,7)? No \u2014 he's going to (3,7), we're going to (2,7) \u2014 different cells. So no collision. Actually, LEFT for us is only dangerous if he stays at (2,7) or moves LEFT to (1,7) while we go LEFT to (2,7) \u2014 then we'd both be at (2,7)? If he stays, we move into his head \u2014 head-on. If he moves LEFT, we move into where he was \u2014 no, he'd be gone. Hmm, simultaneous moves:  \nCase 1: He stays at (2,7) (not moving? possible but unlikely). If we go LEFT to (2,7), we collide with his stationary head \u2014 double KO.  \nCase 2: He moves DOWN to (2,6), we go LEFT to (2,7) \u2014 safe, we occupy his old head position after he leaves.  \nCase 3: He moves LEFT to (1,7), we go LEFT to (2,7) \u2014 safe.  \nCase 4: He moves RIGHT to (3,7), we go LEFT to (2,7) \u2014 safe, different cells.\n\nSo LEFT is only unsafe if he chooses to stay still (unlikely) or possibly if he moves UP? He can't move UP into his body. So maybe LEFT is actually safe? Wait, but moving into a cell where an enemy head *currently* is at start of turn is only collision if both heads end in same cell. If we go to (2,7) and he leaves (2,7), no crash. So LEFT is safe unless he stays. But would he stay? Probably not \u2014 he has safe moves DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Staying still isn't allowed \u2014 must pick a direction. So he won't stay. So LEFT might be safe after all! But still risky if he chooses RIGHT to (3,7) and we choose LEFT to (2,7) \u2014 no issue.\n\nBut let's check board after moves: If we go LEFT to (2,7), our body becomes [(2,7), (3,7), (4,7)]? Wait length 2: head (2,7), tail (4,7), body segment at (3,7). So (3,7) is our body. If enemy goes RIGHT to (3,7), he crashes into our body and dies! That's good for us! So LEFT could be a trap for him if he goes RIGHT.\n\nBut if he goes DOWN to (2,6), we're at (2,7) \u2014 we're above him, could chase.\n\nActually, UP and DOWN are safer with no head-on risk. Which is better strategically?\n\nLook at apples: closest apple at (4,3) far, (2,4) somewhat close, (3,1) below. Going DOWN to (3,6) moves toward center and toward some apples. Going UP to (3,8) moves toward top wall \u2014 limits future moves.\n\nWe want to control space and force enemy into bad spots. If we go DOWN, we stay central. If we go LEFT, we pressure him directly \u2014 maybe force him toward left wall.\n\nBut equal length means avoid head-on. If we go LEFT, we risk him staying still (unlikely) for double KO. But also, if he goes RIGHT into our new body at (3,7), he dies \u2014 that's good! So LEFT could kill him if he chooses RIGHT. What's the chance he goes RIGHT? He might see our head at (3,7) and think RIGHT is safe (since we'll move). But if we move LEFT, (3,7) becomes our body \u2014 he'd crash. That's a nice trap!\n\nLet's check his perspective: From (2,7), his safe moves: DOWN (2,6), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7). RIGHT looks safe if we move away. If we go UP or DOWN, we move away from (3,7), so RIGHT is safe for him. If we go LEFT, we move to (2,7), so (3,7) becomes our body \u2014 he'd die if he goes RIGHT. So going LEFT potentially baits him into death!\n\nThat's a pro gamer move! \ud83d\ude08\n\nBut if he chooses DOWN or LEFT, we're at (2,7) and he's at (2,6) or (1,7) \u2014 we're adjacent, could chase.\n\nI think LEFT is aggressive and possibly lethal for him. UP and DOWN are safe but passive.\n\nWe're here to dominate! Let's set the trap. If he falls for it, he's dead next turn. If not, we're still fine.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n- After moving LEFT to (2,7), if enemy dies by crashing into our body at (3,7), we win.  \n- If he goes DOWN or LEFT, we have length parity \u2014 avoid head-on, try to outmaneuver and eat apples to get longer.  \n- Next turn from (2,7): safe moves likely DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), UP to (2,8) (enemy's old tail? empty), RIGHT to (3,7) our body (no). So we'll have options.\n\nAlright chat, we're going for the bait! LEFT to pressure and possibly insta-kill! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",
