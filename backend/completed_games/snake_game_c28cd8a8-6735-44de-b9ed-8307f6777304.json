No other apples at distance <=2.\n- No adjacent apples anywhere, so maximum 1 apple possible in 3 turns (eat on turn 1, i.e., after second move).\n- Enemy's closest apples are at distance 4+ ((9,5) or (4,9)); cannot reach any in 3 moves, so will score 0.\n- Both paths to (4,9) allow 2 safe follow-up moves on turn 2 (after eating). Choosing LEFT first positions me at (4,8), reducing distance to target to 1 while staying in open space (row 8 mostly empty). Keeps options open for the path without crowding the top row prematurely.\n- No risk of head-on collision or enemy interference en route to (4,9), as enemy max leftward progress in 2 turns is to (7,9).\n\n### Long-term plan:\nTurn 1: Go UP to (4,9) to eat apple (grow to length 2, body at (4,8)).

Alternative first moves (e.g., LEFT) delay eating (4,9) and prevent reaching (2,9) in time for 2 apples.\n- No risks: No head-on potential, no trapping (top row open post-eat), survival prioritized.\n\n### Long-term plan:\nTurn 1: UP eat (4,9), head (4,9) tail (4,8).
