Both UP and RIGHT put us on squares the enemy head can contest immediately. LEFT keeps distance from the enemy head, preserves multiple follow-up options, and begins a safe approach toward the (1,9) apple cluster.\n- LEFT also avoids hugging the very-left wall too early (we can move up after one or two turns to reach the apple while keeping escape routes).\n\nShort long-term plan:\n- Head to (1,9) to collect that apple cluster while monitoring enemy head. If the enemy commits toward our path, pivot toward the apples on the right (8,3)/(8,4) or the low apple at (4,0).\n- Each turn re-evaluate enemy head moves to avoid head-on collisions and avoid becoming trapped along x=0/1.\n\nLEFT",

LEFT also keeps more lateral options (I can continue left, go down later, or loop) and avoids pushing myself into a narrow vertical chase down column 9.\n\nShort plan (for next turns):\n- Move left to take (4,7), then get (4,6) if safe.\n- After securing those apples, reassess enemy positions; prefer to stay out of narrow corridors and avoid running along my own long top-row body.\n- If the bottom apples (5,1 or 9,1) become uncontested and reachable safely, transition downward; otherwise contest the middle apples or circle to create space.\n\nDecision: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Safe and gains an apple.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- RIGHT or UP both have a nontrivial chance of simultaneous head movement into the same cell from the enemy at (2,5). I should avoid moves that might produce a head-on kill.\n- LEFT is a safe apple pickup with no immediate head-on threat and preserves exits (I can still move back into the board next turn).\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Eat (0,4) now. After that, head back toward the cluster on y=4 (4,4 and 6,4) while keeping space to avoid getting boxed in by the tombs/obstacles on the right. Watch enemy head movements from around (2,5) and avoid moves that can be contested.\n\nLEFT",
