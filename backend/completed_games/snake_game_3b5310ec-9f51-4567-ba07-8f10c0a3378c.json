My mistake earlier.)\n\n**Immediate Threats:**\n- Your head is at `(0,6)`. Moving **LEFT** would take you to `(-1,6)` (off the board \u2192 death).\n- Moving **UP** would take you to `(0,7)`.\n- Moving **DOWN** would take you to `(0,5)`.\n- Moving **RIGHT** would take you to `(1,6)`.\n\nNo immediate collisions with enemy snakes (they are far apart), and no self-collision since you have no body yet.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Safe Moves**\nAll four directions are safe for now (no immediate death). Let's evaluate them:\n\n1. **UP (0,6) \u2192 (0,7):**\n   - Proximity to apples: `(2,5)` is not reachable in one move, but `(7,0)` is far away.\n   - Future flexibility: Moving up keeps you near the left edge, but doesn\u2019t immediately threaten apples.\n   - Risk: Enemy snake at `(6,7)` could move left or up to collide with you if they choose poorly, but no immediate threat.\n\n2. **DOWN (0,6) \u2192 (0,5):**\n   - Proximity to apples: `(7,0)` is far, but `(2,5)` is reachable in 2 moves (right twice).\n   - Future flexibility: Moving down keeps you near the bottom edge, which may be safer but limits upward movement.\n   - Risk: No immediate threat, but less direct path to apples.\n\n3. **RIGHT (0,6) \u2192 (1,6):**\n   - Proximity to apples: `(2,5)` is reachable in 2 moves (right twice, then down).\n   - Future flexibility: Moving right opens up more of the board for future movement.\n   - Risk: No immediate threat, but could expose you to enemy movement if they decide to chase you.\n\n4. **LEFT is invalid (off-board).**\n\n---\n\n### **Prioritizing Apple Collection**\nThe closest apple to your head is `(2,5)`. To reach it:\n- From `(0,6)`, you could go **RIGHT \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 DOWN** (to `(2,5)`).\n- Or **DOWN \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 RIGHT** (to `(2,5)`).\n\n**RIGHT is the best first move** because:\n- It moves you closer to `(2,5)` in one step.\n- It keeps you away from the left edge, where you could get trapped if the enemy moves left.\n- It opens up more of the board for future movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Movement Considerations**\nEnemy snake is at `(6,7)`. Their possible moves:\n- UP: `(6,8)`\n- DOWN: `(6,6)`\n- LEFT: `(5,7)`\n- RIGHT: `(7,7)`\n\nNone of these directly threaten you, but if they move **LEFT to `(5,7)`**, they could block your path to `(2,5)` if you go right. However, since they are also length 1, they are unlikely to block you immediately.\n\n---\n\n### **Future Flexibility**\nMoving **RIGHT** gives you more options:\n- You can then go right again to `(2,6)` and then down to `(2,5)`.\n- If you go **DOWN first**, you are stuck near the bottom edge with fewer options.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**\n- No immediate death in any direction.\n- **RIGHT** is the safest and most strategic first move to start collecting apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (For Future Self)**\n1. **Immediate Goal:** Collect `(2,5)` by moving **RIGHT \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 DOWN**.\n2. **After Collecting First Apple:** Grow longer, then prioritize collecting `(7,0)` or `(6,9)` based on enemy movement.\n3. **Avoid Cornering:** Keep at least 2 safe directions open at all times.\n4. **Watch Enemy:** If enemy starts moving aggressively toward you, adjust path to avoid collisions.\n5. **If Enemy is Blocking:** Use their body as a barrier to force them into a corner.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\n**RIGHT** is the best move to start collecting apples while maintaining flexibility.\n\n**RIGHT**",

The closest apples to you are at (2, 5) and (0, 6).\n- Enemy snake is at the top-right corner, with its head at (7, 9) and body extending downward slightly.\n\n### Safe Moves Evaluation\nYour current head is at (1, 6).

(1,7) is not in enemy body.\n   - Safe.\n\n2. **DOWN (y decreases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (1, 5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not off the board.\n     - Not into your own body.\n     - Not into enemy body.\n   - Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (x decreases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (0, 6)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not off the board.\n     - Not into your own body.\n     - Not into enemy body.\n   - Safe.\n   - Also, (0, 6) is an apple! This would grow your snake and give you 1 apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT (x increases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (2, 6)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not off the board.\n     - Not into your own body.\n     - Not into enemy body.\n   - Safe.\n\n### Prioritizing Moves\n- **LEFT** is the best immediate move because it allows you to eat the apple at (0, 6), increasing your length and score.\n- **UP**, **DOWN**, and **RIGHT** are safe but do not provide immediate apple collection.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note\n- **Immediate Goal:** Grow by eating the apple at (0, 6) via LEFT.\n- **Next Steps:**\n  - After eating the apple, your snake will have a body segment at (0, 6). Plan future moves to avoid getting trapped or cornered.\n  - Monitor enemy snake movements. Enemy snake is at the top-right and has already eaten 2 apples. It may try to expand downward or sideways.\n  - Avoid moving into positions where the enemy can easily block your path or collide with you.\n  - Keep an eye on the apple at (2, 5), which is reachable after eating the apple at (0, 6).\n\n### Final Decision\nThe best move is **LEFT** to eat the apple at (0, 6).\n\nLEFT",

Let's evaluate the four possible moves:\n\n1. **UP (y increases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (2, 9)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Off the board (y=9 is valid, but x=2 is within bounds).\n     - Not into your own body.\n     - Not into enemy body.\n   - Safe.\n\n2. **DOWN (y decreases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (2, 7)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not off the board.\n     - Not into your own body.\n     - Not into enemy body.\n   - Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (x decreases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (1, 8)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - This is your own body segment (second segment).\n     - Moving directly into your own body is fatal.\n   - Not safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (x increases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (3, 8)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not off the board.\n     - Not into your own body.\n     - Not into enemy body.\n   - Safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Prioritizing Moves**\nSafe moves are **UP**, **DOWN**, and **RIGHT**. Let's analyze them:\n\n- **UP to (2, 9):**\n  - This move takes you to the top edge of the board.\n  - While safe, it limits your future options since you are now at the top row.\n  - It does not immediately lead you closer to any apples.\n\n- **DOWN to (2, 7):**\n  - This move moves you downward, away from the top row.\n  - It allows you to explore the middle of the board and potentially reach apples like (2, 5) or (5, 5).\n  - It keeps you away from the enemy snake, which is currently in the top-right corner.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3, 8):**\n  - This move moves you further right along the top row.\n  - It keeps you away from the enemy snake and might allow you to reach the apple at (2, 5) more directly in the next few turns.\n  - It maintains flexibility to move downwards in future turns.\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Prioritization**\n- The apple at (2, 5) is relatively close and seems like a good target.\n- The apple at (5, 5) is also reachable but might require more turns.\n\n### **Enemy Snake Analysis**\n- The enemy snake is currently at (8, 7) and might move towards the center or right.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (2, 7) allows you to avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake while exploring the middle of the board.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- **Immediate Goal:** Avoid getting trapped in the top row and keep multiple safe options open.\n- **Next Steps:**\n  - Moving **DOWN** to (2, 7) allows you to explore the middle of the board more freely and potentially reach the apple at (2, 5) or (5, 5).\n  - Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements. The enemy snake is currently in the top-right corner and might move towards the center or right.\n  - Avoid getting cornered and maintain flexibility to move towards other apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nBetween **UP**, **DOWN**, and **RIGHT**, **DOWN** to (2, 7) seems optimal as it keeps you away from the top edge and allows you to explore the middle of the board more freely.\n\n**DOWN**",

Let's analyze them:\n\n- **DOWN to (2, 4):**\n  - This move moves you away from the enemy snake and does not immediately provide an apple.\n  - It keeps your snake flexible and avoids getting trapped in a narrow space.\n\n- **LEFT to (1, 5):**\n  - This move moves you leftward, away from the enemy snake's current position.\n  - It does not immediately provide an apple but keeps you away from the enemy's path.\n  - It also opens up potential paths to apples at (4, 3) and (7, 0) in future turns.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n  - This move moves you closer to the enemy snake's head at (5, 5).\n  - It does not immediately provide an apple but could potentially lead to a collision if the enemy moves right.\n  - It is less safe compared to LEFT or DOWN as it increases the risk of a head-on collision.\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Prioritization**\n- The closest apple to your current position is at (4, 3).\n- Moving **LEFT** to (1, 5) allows you to position yourself to reach (4, 3) more efficiently in the future.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (2, 4) is also safe but does not immediately help in reaching any apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Snake Analysis**\n- The enemy snake is currently at (5, 5) and has a body extending to (8, 6).\n- If the enemy moves **RIGHT**, they could potentially collide with your snake if you are at (3, 5).\n- Moving **LEFT** to (1, 5) keeps you away from the enemy's likely path and maintains flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- **Immediate Goal:** Avoid immediate collisions and position yourself to reach the apple at (4, 3) efficiently.\n- **Next Steps:**\n  - After moving **LEFT** to (1, 5), you can explore moving towards (1, 4) or (1, 6) to reach apples at (4, 3) and (7, 4).\n  - Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements. They might move towards the center or right.\n  - Avoid getting trapped in narrow spaces and maintain flexibility to move towards other apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nBetween **DOWN**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT**, **LEFT** to (1, 5) is optimal as it keeps you away from the enemy snake and maintains flexibility to reach future apples efficiently.\n\n**LEFT**",

Let's evaluate the four possible moves:\n\n1. **UP (y increases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (1, 8)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not off the board (y=8 is valid).\n     - Not into your own body (your body is at (1, 6) and (1, 5)).\n     - Not into enemy body.\n   - Safe.\n\n2. **DOWN (y decreases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (1, 6)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - This is your own body segment (first segment of your body).\n     - Moving directly into your own body is fatal.\n   - Not safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (x decreases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (0, 7)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not off the board (x=0 is valid).\n     - Not into your own body.\n     - Not into enemy body.\n   - Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (x increases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (2, 7)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not off the board.\n     - Not into your own body.\n     - Not into enemy body.\n   - Safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Prioritizing Moves**\nSafe moves are **UP**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT**. Let's analyze them:\n\n- **UP to (1, 8):**\n  - This move moves you to the top edge of the board.\n  - It is safe but does not immediately provide an apple.\n  - It keeps you away from the enemy snake's current path, which is mostly in the lower-middle part of the board.\n  - It opens up potential paths to explore the upper part of the board, potentially reaching apples at (8, 1) or (7, 0) in future turns.\n\n- **LEFT to (0, 7):**\n  - This move moves you to the left edge of the board.\n  - It is safe and keeps you away from the enemy snake.\n  - It limits future flexibility but could be useful if you want to move towards the apple at (1, 1) or (2, 2) in future turns.\n\n- **RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n  - This move moves you to the right side of your current position.\n  - It is safe and allows you to explore more of the board.\n  - It could potentially lead you towards the apple at (8, 1) or (7, 0) if you move right and then down.\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Prioritization**\n- The closest apple to your current position is at (1, 1), but it is not directly reachable in one move.\n- The apple at (8, 1) is reachable if you move **RIGHT** and then **DOWN** a few times.\n- The apple at (7, 0) is also reachable but requires more strategic movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Snake Analysis**\n- The enemy snake's head is at (7, 4) and its body extends to (7, 6).\n- The enemy could move in any direction, but moving **UP** to (7, 5) or **DOWN** to (7, 3) could be risky if you are in their path.\n- If you move **UP** to (1, 8), you are far away from the enemy snake's current path, which is safer.\n- If you move **RIGHT** to (2, 7), you are still relatively safe but closer to the right edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- **Immediate Goal:** Avoid getting trapped and maintain flexibility to reach apples.\n- **Next Steps:**\n  - Moving **UP** to (1, 8) keeps you away from the enemy snake and allows you to explore the upper part of the board.\n  - From (1, 8), you can then move **RIGHT** to (2, 8) or **LEFT** to (0, 8) to explore further.\n  - Keep an eye on the enemy's movements and avoid potential head-on collisions.\n  - Consider moving towards the apple at (8, 1) if you can find a safe path.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nBetween **UP**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT**, **RIGHT** to (2, 7) is the best choice. This move allows you to explore more of the board and potentially reach the apple at (8, 1) in the future while keeping you away from the enemy snake's current path.\n\n**RIGHT**",

My snake is currently at (2, 7) with body [(1, 7), (1, 6)], so I need to avoid getting trapped in its path.\n2. **Prioritize apple (8, 1)** \u2013 It\u2019s the closest high-value target (y=1 is near the bottom-left corner, but x=8 is far right). If I can reach it, I can grow and potentially block the enemy\u2019s path.\n3. **Explore the upper-right (y=8-9)** \u2013 Moving UP to (1, 8) last turn was safe but didn\u2019t yield an apple. Now, I can try moving RIGHT to (2, 7) to expand my reach toward (8, 1).\n4. **Watch for enemy\u2019s next move** \u2013 If Snake #1 moves UP to (7, 5) or DOWN to (7, 2), I need to avoid its path. If it moves RIGHT or LEFT, I can adjust accordingly.\n\n**Potential Paths:**\n- **Option 1: RIGHT \u2192 DOWN \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 DOWN** to reach (8, 1) (apple at (8, 1)).\n  - Turn 17: RIGHT to (2, 7)\n  - Turn 18: DOWN to (2, 6)\n  - Turn 19: RIGHT to (3, 6)\n  - Turn 20: DOWN to (3, 5) \u2192 (3, 5) is safe (no enemy or self-collision).\n- **Option 2: UP \u2192 LEFT \u2192 UP \u2192 LEFT** to explore the top-left (y=8-9, x=0-2).\n  - Less efficient for apple collection but safer if the enemy is aggressive.\n- **Option 3: LEFT \u2192 DOWN \u2192 LEFT \u2192 DOWN** to reach (1, 1) or (2, 2).\n  - (1, 1) is an apple, but it\u2019s closer to Snake #1\u2019s path (head at (7, 3)), so riskier.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Snake #1\u2019s body is at (7, 3)-(7, 6). If it moves UP to (7, 5), it could block my path to (8, 1) if I go RIGHT \u2192 DOWN.\n- If I move RIGHT to (2, 7), I\u2019m still safe but need to avoid its potential UP/DOWN moves.\n\n**Best Move: RIGHT**\nThis keeps me flexible to reach (8, 1) while avoiding immediate threats.
