However, we should also consider the apple at (7, 9), which is above our current position.\n\nSince our goal is to collect apples and grow, moving towards the closest apple seems like the best strategy for now. But we should also think about the potential risks and rewards of each move. Moving right towards the apple at (9, 4) might put us in a vulnerable position, as we would be closer to the edge of the board and potentially closer to the enemy snake.\n\nOn the other hand, moving up towards the apple at (7, 9) would give us more flexibility and options for our next move. We would be moving away from the edge of the board and potentially creating more distance between ourselves and the enemy snake.\n\nGiven the current board state and our position, I think the most logical move would be to move up towards the apple at (7, 9). This would give us more control and flexibility for our next move, and would also put us in a good position to potentially collect another apple.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue to prioritize moving towards the closest apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position and potential collisions.
