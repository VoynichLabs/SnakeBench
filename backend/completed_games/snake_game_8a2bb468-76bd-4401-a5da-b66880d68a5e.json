That's fine.  \nBut maybe better to go UP first to (8,1) to keep more space open and approach apples more flexibly.\n\nCheck immediate danger: enemy at (2,0) could move RIGHT to (3,0), then keep coming, but we're far apart. No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (8,1): next moves UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all safe (except maybe DOWN back to (8,0) after I move there, but that's fine while short).  \nFrom (9,0): next moves UP, LEFT only (RIGHT off board, DOWN off board). So fewer options.\n\nSo UP is better for keeping options open.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP is safe, keeps more future moves, and moves me closer to apples (9,2) and (7,6) vertically.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,1), consider moving toward (9,2) (RIGHT then UP) or (7,6) (LEFT then UP).

So all three moves are safe from head-on collision with enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (9,8) is 2 right, 2 up from me (Manhattan distance 4).  \n- (5,9) is 2 left, 3 up (Manhattan distance 5).  \n- (3,9) is 4 left, 3 up (distance 7).  \n- (9,7) is 2 right, 1 up (distance 3).  \n- (8,0) is far away.  \n\nBest apple to target short-term: (9,7) distance 3.  \n\nFrom (7,6):  \n- UP (7,7) \u2192 distance to (9,7) = 2 right, 0 up = 2.  \n- LEFT (6,6) \u2192 distance to (9,7) = 3 right, 1 up = 4.  \n- RIGHT (8,6) \u2192 distance to (9,7) = 1 right, 1 up = 2.  \n\nBoth UP and RIGHT reduce distance to (9,7). UP puts me at (7,7), next move could be RIGHT twice to (9,7). RIGHT puts me at (8,6), next move could be RIGHT+UP to (9,7).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety considerations:**  \nIf I go UP to (7,7): next turn my body will be at (7,6), (7,5), (7,4). From (7,7), possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is body). That\u2019s fine.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,6): next turn body at (7,6), (7,5), (7,4). From (8,6), possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is body). Also fine.  \n\nLEFT to (6,6) moves away from nearest apples, less optimal unless avoiding danger \u2014 but no immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement and future risk:**  \nEnemy could go UP to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,7). It might aim for (3,9) or (5,9) apples. No direct threat to me now.  \n\nBut if enemy goes RIGHT repeatedly, it could reach center in a few turns. I should secure closest apple (9,7) quickly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose between UP and RIGHT:**  \nBoth reduce distance to (9,7) equally (Manhattan distance after move = 2).  \nUP gives me higher y, which is good because apples (9,8), (5,9), (3,9) are all top rows.  \nRIGHT gets me closer to right edge, but (9,7) is at y=7, so UP first then RIGHT might be slightly better because I stay more central in y.  \n\nActually:  \nUP \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 next turn RIGHT to (8,7) \u2192 then RIGHT to (9,7) eats apple.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 next turn RIGHT to (9,6) \u2192 then UP to (9,7) eats apple.  \n\nBoth take 2 more moves to reach apple.  \n\nBut UP now gives option to go to (8,7) next, which is closer to (9,8) apple after eating (9,7).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo UP now to (7,7). Next turn, if safe, go RIGHT toward (9,7) apple. Keep an eye on enemy moving toward top row apples.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

But that delays scoring by 1 turn.  \n\nGiven the win condition is most apples, scoring sooner is beneficial, and being at (9,7) still allows UP to (9,8) next turn for another apple if it remains.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT gets apple now, extends lead, and still allows possible second apple next turn. The slightly reduced future mobility is acceptable because enemy is far and board has open space near top right.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,7) after eating apple, check if (9,8) apple still there and if UP is safe (no enemy head moving into (9,8)).

The slight reduction in next-turn safe moves is acceptable given the score advantage and enemy distance.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,8), check if UP to (9,9) or LEFT to (8,8) is safer. Avoid moving into enemy\u2019s possible future positions. Consider moving toward remaining apples at (5,9) or (3,9) gradually while keeping space to maneuver.

Keep an eye on enemy #0\u2019s position \u2014 it may go for (5,9) soon. Avoid getting trapped in corners.  \n\nLEFT",

If enemy moves RIGHT into (6,6), enemy dies (hits my body). That\u2019s safe for me.  \n\nEnemy\u2019s possible heads next turn: (5,7), (5,5). Neither overlaps with my possible moves: DOWN (7,3), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4). No head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Immediate apple opportunity:**  \nDOWN goes directly to apple (7,3). Eating it grows me to length 8, adds 1 apple (7 total), and removes that apple from the board.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \nIf DOWN to (7,3) and eat apple:  \nNext turn from (7,3) with new tail segment added at end (currently tail at (7,8), after growth tail stays at (7,8) but body extends by 1 at head after move). Actually, after eating, the new segment is added at the head\u2019s previous position before moving? In Snake, after moving to apple, the head moves to apple cell, and a new body segment is added at the old tail position? Wait, standard Snake: you grow by not removing the tail that turn. So my body becomes: head at (7,3), then old head (7,4), then (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8) \u2014 length 8.  \nFrom (7,3) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (7,4) \u2013 my body.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,2) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,3) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,3) \u2013 empty.  \nSo 3 safe follow-ups (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good.\n\nIf LEFT to (6,4):  \nNext turn from (6,4): UP (6,5) \u2013 my body, DOWN (6,3) \u2013 empty, LEFT (5,4) \u2013 empty, RIGHT (7,4) \u2013 my body. Only 2 safe follow-ups (DOWN, LEFT). Less safe.\n\nIf RIGHT to (8,4):  \nNext turn from (8,4): UP (8,5) \u2013 empty, DOWN (8,3) \u2013 empty, LEFT (7,4) \u2013 my body, RIGHT (9,4) \u2013 empty. 3 safe follow-ups (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term pathing:**  \nApple (7,3) is right below me. Eating it now is efficient.  \nOther apples: (8,0), (5,1), (6,0), (8,9). After eating (7,3), I can plan toward (6,0) or (8,0) next.  \nEnemy is far away in top-left, not an immediate threat.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN gives apple, grows me, and has 3 safe follow-ups next turn.  \nRIGHT also has 3 safe follow-ups but no apple.  \nLEFT has only 2 safe follow-ups, riskier.  \n\nBest choice: DOWN to eat apple safely and maintain flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,3) after eating apple, avoid moving UP into own body. Consider moving DOWN to (7,2) or LEFT/RIGHT to stay safe and aim for (6,0) or (8,0). Keep monitoring enemy\u2019s position \u2014 enemy may move toward center eventually.\n\nDOWN",

Eating apple would make my tail stay put, so after eating, from (8,5) I\u2019d have more options.  \n\nIf DOWN to (8,2):  \nNext turn from (8,2): UP (8,3) \u2013 my body, DOWN (8,1) \u2013 empty, LEFT (7,2) \u2013 empty, RIGHT (9,2) \u2013 empty \u2192 3 safe follow-ups.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (9,3):  \nNext turn from (9,3): UP (9,4) \u2013 empty, DOWN (9,2) \u2013 empty, LEFT (8,3) \u2013 my body, RIGHT off board \u2192 2 safe follow-ups (UP, DOWN).  \n\nSo UP has only 1 safe follow-up unless I eat apple, which changes dynamics. But if I go UP and enemy moves toward me, I could be trapped near top edge.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term pathing and enemy avoidance:**  \nEnemy at (5,4) could move to (6,4), (5,3), or (4,4). From (6,4) enemy is still far from me if I\u2019m at (8,4).  \nApple (8,5) is very tempting \u2014 eating it extends my lead to 8 vs 5.  \nBut going UP now means next turn I must go UP again into apple (8,5) \u2014 that\u2019s safe unless enemy somehow reaches (8,5) before me (impossible this turn). After eating, my new head at (8,5) will have body behind at (8,4), (8,3), etc. Then from (8,5) I\u2019ll have to check moves carefully because top row is near.  \n\nGiven my apple lead, I could play safer: DOWN gives more future options, but delays eating.  \nUP is riskier next turn if I eat apple and then am at (8,5) with limited exits (only RIGHT and DOWN maybe), but I\u2019ll have grown, so tail won\u2019t move immediately, possibly opening more space.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll go for the apple (8,5) because it extends my lead and is reachable safely.  \nUP to (8,4) now, then next turn UP to (8,5) to eat apple.  \nCheck: from (8,4) enemy heads possible next turn are at least 4 cells away, no head-on risk.  \nEven if enemy moves toward me, they can\u2019t reach (8,5) before I eat it next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,4), plan to go UP to (8,5) to eat apple unless something unexpected happens (enemy moves into (8,5) \u2014 impossible this turn). After eating, from (8,5) consider RIGHT to (9,5) or DOWN to (8,4) (but (8,4) will be my neck so not allowed), so likely RIGHT to (9,5) or LEFT to (7,5) if safe. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s position.\n\nUP",

From (8,8):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,9) \u2013 apple.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,7) \u2013 my body (old head), unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,8) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) \u2013 empty.  \nThree safe follow-ups: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nIf LEFT to (7,7):  \nFrom (7,7):  \n- UP \u2192 (7,8) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,6) \u2013 my body, unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,7) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,7) \u2013 my body, unsafe.  \nTwo safe follow-ups: UP, LEFT.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (9,7):  \nFrom (9,7):  \n- UP \u2192 (9,8) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,6) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,7) \u2013 my body, unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board, unsafe.  \nTwo safe follow-ups: UP, DOWN.  \n\nSo UP gives 3 safe moves next turn, LEFT gives 2, RIGHT gives 2.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat next turn:**  \nEnemy\u2019s possible positions after this turn: (6,2), (6,0), (7,1).  \nIf enemy goes to (6,0), it eats apple and grows to length 8.  \nIf enemy goes to (7,1), it\u2019s closer to my area but still far from my possible positions next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nI\u2019m ahead in apples (8 vs 6).  \nUP gets me closer to (8,9) safely and keeps options open.  \nLEFT or RIGHT don\u2019t improve my position as much.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,8), I can go UP to eat (8,9) next turn if safe, or move sideways to avoid being predictable. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible moves toward (8,9) \u2014 they\u2019re far away for now.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP is safest, gives most options, and moves toward apple.  \n\nUP",

Wait, check:  \nLast turn I moved UP from (8,8) to (8,9) and ate apple at (8,9).  \nSo my new length is 10.  \nOld body before move: [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)] length 9.  \nAfter eating apple, head moves to (8,9), body becomes:  \n[(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)] length 10.  \nYes, tail is still at (7,5).  \n\nFrom (8,9):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,10) off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,9) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,9) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSafe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy snake #0\u2019s possible moves from (5,0):**  \nEnemy head: (5,0), body: [(6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)] length 7.  \nFrom (5,0):  \n- UP \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 its own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,0) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 its own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nOnly safe move for enemy: LEFT to (4,0).  \nSo next turn enemy head will be at (4,0).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nMy possible next heads: (7,9) if LEFT, (9,9) if RIGHT.  \nEnemy\u2019s next head: (4,0). No overlap \u2192 safe.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple locations and proximity:**  \nApples: (8,0), (3,5), (3,3), (1,1), (9,3).  \nClosest to me:  \n- (9,3) is 6 steps away (down and left from (9,9) or (7,9)).  \n- (8,0) far down.  \n\nNeither apple is immediately reachable in 1 move.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\nIf LEFT to (7,9):  \nFrom (7,9):  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,9) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,9) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nTwo safe follow-ups: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (9,9):  \nFrom (9,9):  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,9) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nOnly one safe follow-up: DOWN.  \n\nSo LEFT gives 2 safe moves next turn, RIGHT gives 1 safe move.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nI\u2019m at length 10, enemy length 7. I want to stay alive and keep options open.  \nRIGHT leads to a potential trap next turn (only DOWN safe), which could be risky if enemy approaches later.  \nLEFT keeps more options.  \n\nAlso, moving LEFT to (7,9) leaves me closer to center, more room to maneuver toward apples like (9,3) or (3,3) later.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,9), likely go DOWN or LEFT to avoid top edge trap, and start moving toward middle apples while keeping distance from enemy who is far away at bottom left.  \n\n**Final choice:** LEFT to maintain flexibility.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, check: tail is at (8,5) now, but after I move, tail moves forward one cell because I didn\u2019t eat apple. So next turn tail will be at (8,6)? Let\u2019s trace: current body: head (6,5), then (6,6)...(8,6),(8,5) is last? Actually last body segment is (8,6)?? Let\u2019s check given body list: Body: [(6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)] \u2192 yes, tail is (8,6), not (8,5). So (8,5) is empty now. So RIGHT to (7,5) then next turn RIGHT to (8,5) is safe. Let\u2019s check properly.)  \n\nActually, let\u2019s re-evaluate:  \nCurrent tail is (8,6). After I move without eating apple, tail moves to (8,7)? Wait, snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position. So:  \nOld head (6,5) moves to new head.  \nOld body[0] (6,6) \u2192 new body[0] = old head (6,5).  \nOld body[1] (6,7) \u2192 new body[1] = old body[0] (6,6).  \n\u2026  \nOld tail (8,6) \u2192 new tail = old body[8] = (8,7)? Let\u2019s check: old body[8] is (8,6), so new tail = old body[7] = (8,7). Yes, so tail moves from (8,6) to (8,7). So (8,5) stays empty.  \n\nSo from (7,5) next turn:  \n- UP (7,6) \u2192 my body (old (6,6) will be there) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (7,4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (6,5) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (8,5) \u2192 empty.  \nSo safe follow-ups: DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nSo:  \nDOWN \u2192 3 safe follow-ups.  \nLEFT \u2192 2 safe follow-ups.  \nRIGHT \u2192 2 safe follow-ups.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy will likely eat apple (3,5) and grow, extending its body upward. That may block some left-side paths later.  \nI\u2019m at 9 apples, enemy at 8 apples. If enemy eats (3,5), both at 9 apples.  \nI should aim for closest apple that\u2019s safe: (9,3) is reachable via RIGHT then UP, but that\u2019s near my body area.  \n(8,0) is far but moving DOWN gets me closer.  \n\nBest to keep options open: DOWN gives most follow-up moves and moves toward (8,0) while staying clear of enemy\u2019s area.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,4), I\u2019ll have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe. Consider moving toward (8,0) via DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT as needed, while watching enemy\u2019s new length after it eats apple.  \n\nDOWN",

My earlier rationale last turn incorrectly said apple at (3,5).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nMy possible next heads: (6,3), (5,4), (7,4).  \nEnemy possible next heads: (3,6), (2,5), (4,5).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and movement toward apples:**  \nFrom (6,4):  \n- DOWN to (6,3): moves toward (8,0) (Manhattan distance from 6,3 to 8,0 = |6-8|+|3-0|=5).  \n- LEFT to (5,4): moves toward (1,4) (distance 4) and (1,1) (distance 7).  \n- RIGHT to (7,4): moves toward (9,3) (distance 3) and (8,0) (distance 7).  \n\nClosest apple is (9,3) from RIGHT path (distance 3 after move).  \n(1,4) is distance 4 from LEFT path.  \n(8,0) is distance 5 from DOWN path.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\n**If DOWN to (6,3):**  \nNext turn from (6,3):  \n- UP \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 my old head position (will be body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,3) \u2192 empty.  \nSafe follow-ups: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 3 options.\n\n**If LEFT to (5,4):**  \nFrom (5,4):  \n- UP \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 my body (old (6,5) will be there) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 my old head (body) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe follow-ups: DOWN, LEFT \u2192 2 options.\n\n**If RIGHT to (7,4):**  \nFrom (7,4):  \n- UP \u2192 (7,5) \u2192 my body (old (6,5) will be there) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,3) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 my old head (body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,4) \u2192 empty.  \nSafe follow-ups: DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 2 options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy growth threat:**  \nEnemy is length 10, I\u2019m length 10. No apple near enemy head right now except maybe (1,4) is somewhat close to enemy if it goes LEFT then DOWN later.  \nEnemy might move toward (1,4) or (0,8) or (1,1).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT toward (9,3), I eat apple next turn if I go RIGHT then UP to (8,3) then (9,3)? Wait, from (7,4) to (9,3) in two moves: (7,4) \u2192 (8,4) \u2192 (9,4) \u2192 (9,3) is 3 moves. Actually, quickest: (7,4) \u2192 (8,4) \u2192 (9,4) \u2192 (9,3) or (7,4) \u2192 (7,3) \u2192 (8,3) \u2192 (9,3) still 3 moves.  \nFrom (6,4) \u2192 (7,4) \u2192 (8,4) \u2192 (9,4) \u2192 (9,3) is 4 moves.  \n\nBut apple (9,3) is close to my body area (tail around (8,7)), so careful not to trap myself.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN gives most future safe moves (3 options) and moves toward apple (8,0) while staying clear of enemy\u2019s likely path toward left-side apples.  \nLEFT gives fewer options and moves toward enemy\u2019s possible path to (1,4).  \nRIGHT gives fewer options and moves toward apple (9,3) but near my own body.\n\nGiven safety first, DOWN seems best for keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,3), I\u2019ll have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe. Consider moving toward (8,0) via DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, but also watch enemy\u2019s movement \u2014 it might go for (1,4) or (0,8). Avoid getting trapped in bottom right corner later.\n\nDOWN",

So (9, 3) is near my tail area but not immediately dangerous.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives the closest apple (distance 2) and enemy is far from it.  \nLEFT gives fewer future safe moves and competes with enemy for apple.  \nDOWN gives more future safe moves but apple is farther.  \n\nGiven I need to catch up in apples (tied now), going for closest apple while safe is good.

Watch enemy\u2019s movement toward left-side apples; if enemy goes for (1, 4), I can secure (9, 3) and maybe (8, 0) later. Avoid trapping myself in top-right corner after eating (9, 3).  \n\nRIGHT",

DOWN is also safe but delays apple. Since both have equal immediate safety and future options, I\u2019ll take the apple path to gain advantage.  \n\nRIGHT",

From (1, 6), I'd have access to UP, LEFT, and RIGHT next turn, but I'd be moving away from the valuable apples.\n\n**LEFT to (0, 5):** Moves me to the left edge, away from the apples at (1, 4) and (1, 1). This would waste a turn and potentially put me in a corner with limited options.\n\n**DOWN to (1, 4):** **Excellent move!** This:\n- Collects the apple at (1, 4) - giving me 10 apples and the lead\n- Grows my snake by 1 segment\n- Positions me perfectly to reach the adjacent apple at (1, 1) on the next turn\n- From (1, 4), I'd have UP, DOWN, and LEFT options available next turn\n- Maintains safe distance from the enemy snake\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\nThe enemy at (7, 3) has these safe moves:\n- UP: (7, 4) - safe, empty\n- DOWN: (7, 2) - safe, empty\n- LEFT: (6, 3) - hits their own body, DEADLY\n- RIGHT: (8, 3) - safe, empty\n\nThe enemy cannot move LEFT, so they'll likely move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT, staying on the right side of the board. This means DOWN is safe for me and maximizes distance between our snakes.\n\n**Short-term plan:**\n1. Turn 38: DOWN to (1, 4) to collect that apple\n2. Turn 39: LEFT to (0, 4), then DOWN to (0, 3), DOWN to (0, 2), DOWN to (0, 1), DOWN to (0, 1) for training purposes - actually after getting (1, 4), I should consider going DOWN to (1, 3), then LEFT to (0, 3) to approach (1, 1)\n3. Actually reconsidering: after (1, 4), I can go DOWN to (1, 3), LEFT to (0, 3), DOWN to (0, 2), LEFT to reach (0, 1), then UP to (1, 1) to collect the second apple\n\nActually, let me simplify my plan:\n\n**Optimized short-term plan:**\n- Turn 38: DOWN to collect apple at (1, 4)\n- Turn 39: DOWN to (1, 3) \n- Turn 40: LEFT to (0, 3)\n- Turn 41: DOWN to (0, 2)\n- Turn 42: DOWN to (0, 1)\n- Turn 43: RIGHT to (1, 1) to collect second apple\n\nCollecting the apple at (1, 4) is the priority right now - it gives me the lead and positions me well for future apple collection.\n\nDOWN",

So from (6,0) to (5,0) apple: safe, and after eating, next turn head at (5,0) with body: [(5,0), (6,0), (8,0), ...].  \n\nFrom (5,0) next turn after eating:  \n- UP \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 '.'  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,0) \u2192 '.'  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 my body (unsafe).  \nSo only 2 safe moves from (5,0) after eating apple \u2014 risk of getting stuck near bottom edge.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement toward apples:**  \nEnemy might go for (5,0) too. From (2,1), distance to (5,0) is 4 steps. If I go LEFT to (6,0), I'm 1 step away. But if enemy goes (2,0) then (3,0) then (4,0) then (5,0), that's 3 more turns. I'd eat it next turn before they reach it. However, if they go (2,0) then (3,0) then (4,0), they'd be at (4,0) when I'm at (5,0) after eating \u2014 possible head-on risk next turn if we both move toward each other? Possibly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nWe both have 11 apples (maybe 12 if enemy ate last turn). Need 30 to win.  \nGoing LEFT to (6,0) gets apple next turn but traps me along bottom with fewer options.  \nGoing UP to (7,1) keeps more space and I can still get (5,0) later via (7,1)\u2192(6,1)\u2192(5,1)\u2192(5,0) or similar, but enemy might take it first.  \n\nBut safety first: UP gives more future flexibility. Apple (5,0) is contested, but if enemy gets it, I can target (7,7) or (9,8).  \n\nGiven the board, my tail is at (6,6) moving eventually, so I have time.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP to (7,1) is safe, gives maximum next-turn options, avoids bottom-edge trap.  \nLEFT to (6,0) is safe but reduces future options after eating apple.  \nI'll choose UP for flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (7,1), consider moving toward (5,0) if enemy isn't too close, else aim for (7,7) or (9,8). Keep space around head.\n\nUP",

Good offensive option.\n\n2. **LEFT to (1, 3)**: Puts me in position to potentially loop back around or go toward the apple at (0, 8), but I'd need to be careful with my long body. Limited options from there.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (3, 3)**: Gives me good flexibility. From (3, 3) I could go UP toward apples or continue RIGHT.

They could also go LEFT to (5, 1).\n\n**Best move:** **UP to (2, 4)** - This positions me well to pursue the apple at (2, 7) while keeping the enemy at a safe distance on the bottom half of the board. It's more aggressive but still safe, and we're tied at 11 apples, so I should push for advantage.\n\n**Future plan:** From (2, 4), assess whether to continue UP to (2, 5), but note that's currently my tail position - by the time I get there, my tail should have moved. Keep tracking enemy position and maintain routing options.\n\nUP",

Securing (5,0) gives me a lead.  \nLEFT to (5,1) is best:  \n- Puts me 1 step from (5,0) next turn.  \n- Gives 4 safe follow-up moves next turn.  \n- Avoids dead-end risk of DOWN move.  \n- Keeps me closer to other apples (2,7) and (7,7) afterward.\n\nFrom (5,1) next turn, eat (5,0) if still there, then consider moving toward center or upper apples while monitoring enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT to (5,1) is safe, maximizes next-turn options, and secures (5,0) before enemy can reach it.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5,1), move DOWN to eat (5,0) unless enemy head is adjacent to it (unlikely). Then assess path to (2,7) or (7,7) while avoiding trapping myself.\n\nLEFT",
