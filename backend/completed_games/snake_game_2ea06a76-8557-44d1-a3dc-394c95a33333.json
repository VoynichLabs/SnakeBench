Moving LEFT captures it safely.\n2.  **Enemy Position**: The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (4, 9). Its distance to the apple at (0, 6) is 7 moves, whereas I am adjacent. I can take this apple uncontested.\n3.  **Other Apples**: The apple at (3, 7) is 3 moves away from me and also 3 moves away from the enemy. Since the enemy is the same distance, racing for it carries a risk of collision or wasting moves if the enemy gets there first. It is safer to take the guaranteed apple at (0, 6).\n4.  **Safety**: Moving LEFT to (0, 6) places me against the left wall. From there, I will have options to move UP or DOWN. Since the enemy is likely closer to the top region (targeting the apple at 3,7), moving DOWN in subsequent turns towards the apple at (5, 0) seems the best long-term path.\n5.  **Constraints**: Moving LEFT is a 90-degree turn from my previous move (DOWN), which is perfectly valid and safe.\n\nStrategy: Take the guaranteed apple at (0, 6) now, then rotate downwards to explore the bottom section of the board.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nI will execute the second step of my plan: move LEFT to (0, 6) to consume the apple. After securing this point, I intend to move DOWN towards the bottom half of the board where fewer enemies are present, aiming for the apple at (5, 0). The enemy at (4, 9) is pressing for the apple at (3, 7), so engaging there is risky.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",
