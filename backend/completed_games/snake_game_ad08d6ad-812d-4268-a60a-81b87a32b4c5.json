Enemy snake 0 is at (4, 7) and has no body segments.\nApples are at: A1=(3, 7), A2=(9, 3), A3=(9, 8), A4=(5, 1), A5=(9, 7).\n\nMy immediate goal is to move safely and try to reach an apple.\n\n**Current position:** Head at (0, 4).\n\n**Possible moves and immediate consequences:**\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 5):**\n    *   **Self-collision check:** Safe. My body is empty.\n    *   **Off-board check:** Safe (y=5 is on board).\n    *   **Enemy collision check:** Enemy head is at (4, 7). Moving to (0, 5) is safe from collision with enemy head.\n    *   **Apple proximity:** Closest apples are A1=(3, 7) and A4=(5, 1). (0, 5) is a neutral position, maybe slightly better for heading towards (3, 7) than (5, 1) in terms of X movement availability.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 3):**\n    *   **Self-collision check:** Safe (no body).\n    *   **Off-board check:** Safe (y=3 is on board).\n    *   **Enemy collision check:** Safe from self/enemy head.\n    *   **Apple proximity:** Leads towards (9, 3) eventually, but (0, 5) or (1, 4) might be better initial steps.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 4):**\n    *   **Off-board check:** Unsafe. Dies immediately. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 4):**\n    *   **Self-collision check:** Safe.\n    *   **Off-board check:** Safe.\n    *   **Enemy collision check:** Safe from self/enemy head.\n    *   **Apple proximity:** Moves towards the general center/right side of the board. This keeps options open and moves away from the left edge wall.\n\n**Comparing safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\n*   **UP (0, 5):** Still on the left edge.\n*   **DOWN (0, 3):** Still on the left edge.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 4):** Breaks out from the wall, increasing mobility options for the next turn, and places me closer to the main field of play.\n\nThe closest apple is (3, 7), which is 3 steps away in Manhattan distance.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 4):\nTurn 1: (1, 4)\nTurn 2: (2, 4) or (1, 5) or (1, 3)\nTurn 3: (3, 4) or (2, 5) or (2, 3)\nTurn 4: (3, 5) or (3, 3) or (4, 4)\nTurn 5: (3, 6) or (3, 7) <- Potential apple contact\n\nEnemy snake 0 is at (4, 7). If I move UP to (0, 5), they might move towards (3, 7) or (5, 7). If they move towards (4, 8), I can move towards (3, 7) more safely next turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems strategically superior as it immediately increases horizontal movement options compared to staying flush against the wall. (1, 4) is a very open space.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the enemy's likely move. Snake 0 at (4, 7) is close to A1=(3, 7). It could move LEFT to (3, 7) and eat the apple on Turn 1, or UP/DOWN/RIGHT.\nIf Enemy 0 moves LEFT to (3, 7) and eats A1:\nTurn 1: E0 at (3, 7) (eats), Me at (1, 4) (if I go RIGHT)\nTurn 2: E0 will be slightly larger, Me needs to decide how to approach the remaining apples (9, 3), (9, 8), (5, 1), (9, 7).\n\nBy moving RIGHT to (1, 4), I prioritize board space and future flexibility. Since no move guarantees an apple this turn, maximizing safety and open options is key.\n\nI choose RIGHT to (1, 4).\n\nStrategy Note: Prioritize movement away from the edge walls while heading generally towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board ((9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 7)) or the closest one (3, 7). Moving to (1, 4) offers the best immediate flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake 0 is at [(3, 7), (4, 7)].\n\n**Enemy Prediction & Potential Apple Snags:**\nEnemy 0 is currently at (3, 7), adjacent to Apple A1=(3, 7). It is highly likely Enemy 0 will move LEFT to (3, 7) if the first coordinate of the apple is what I mistyped earlier. Wait, the apple list says: Apples at: (9, 3), (9, 8), (5, 1), (9, 7), (8, 2).\nThe board display shows:\n7 . . . 0 T . . . . A (This 'A' must be one of the apples, let's check coordinates based on the board visualization vs the list)\nBoard shows:\n(3, 7) is occupied by Enemy 0 head.\n(4, 7) is occupied by Enemy 0 body.\n(9, 7) is an Apple (A). (This corresponds to the apple list: (9, 7))\nWait, examining the board visualization provided:\nRow 7: `7 . . . 0 T . . . . A`\nThe map shows an enemy snake at (3, 7) (head) and (4, 7) (body). This means the enemy snake has already eaten one apple previously.\nThere is an 'A' at (9, 7) on the map.\n\nLet's re-check the board visualization vs the coordinates provided:\nApples at: (9, 3) [Map: A at ROW 3, COL 9], (9, 8) [Map: A at ROW 8, COL 9], (5, 1) [Map: A at ROW 1, COL 5], (9, 7) [Map: A at ROW 7, COL 9], (8, 2) [Map: A at ROW 2, COL 8].\n\nThe map visualization shows:\nRow 7: `7 . . . 0 T . . . . A` -> This implies Enemy 0 is at (3, 7) and a body segment at (4, 7). The 'A' is at (9, 7). *This layout is confusing because the enemy head is at (3, 7), but there is no apple listed at (3, 7).* Let's trust the provided coordinate lists over visual interpretation if they conflict regarding *why* the enemy has 1 apple. Since the enemy has 1 apple, they ate one previously. The current closest apple is (5, 1) (Manhattan dist 5) or (9, 3) (Manhattan dist 10). The apples near the enemy snake (3, 7) are far away.\n\nMy current position: (1, 4). I am relatively safe and central.\n\n**Possible Moves from (1, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 5):** Moves vertically, slightly towards the center. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 3):** Moves vertically, slightly towards the bottom. Safe.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 4):** Continues expanding horizontally away from the wall. Safe.\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 4):** Moves back to the edge wall. Less favorable than previous turn.\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (Snake 0 at (3, 7), Body at (4, 7)):**\nThe enemy snake is not immediately threatened. It will likely try to aim for an apple.\nClosest apples to E0 (3, 7):\n*   (9, 7) [Dist 6]\n*   (9, 8) [Dist 7]\n*   (8, 2) [Dist 10]\n\nIf E0 moves UP to (3, 8): Safe.\nIf E0 moves RIGHT to (4, 7): Collides with its own body at (4, 7). **Unsafe move for E0.** (Wait, E0 body is at (4, 7). If E0 moves RIGHT, its new head would be (4, 7), hitting its own body piece!) **This is a crucial observation.** If E0 moves RIGHT, it dies.\nIf E0 moves LEFT to (2, 7): Safe. Moves away from apples.\nIf E0 moves DOWN to (3, 6): Safe.\n\nThe enemy snake is in a difficult spot if it wants to move horizontally right, due to its body placement at (4, 7).\n\nSafe moves for E0: UP (3, 8), LEFT (2, 7), DOWN (3, 6).\nIf E0 moves UP to (3, 8), it is potentially heading towards (9, 8).\nIf E0 moves DOWN to (3, 6), it is heading towards the center.\n\n**My Strategy:**\nI should continue moving towards the middle/right side of the board, focusing on apples (9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 7). Moving RIGHT seems the most proactive to cover ground towards these far-right apples, while staying safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 4):\nTurn 2: Me at (2, 4). E0 moves (e.g., to (3, 8)).\n\nThis keeps me expanding and moving towards the right half where 3/5 apples are located. Since no apple is immediately reachable, expanding safely is the priority.\n\nLong-term plan: Reach column 5 or 6 safely, then decide whether to tackle the cluster near (9, Y) or the isolated one at (5, 1). Avoid getting boxed in by the enemy or the walls.\n\nI will choose RIGHT, moving to (2, 4).\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy previous move was RIGHT, resulting in my head at (1, 4). I am now considering the move from (1, 4).\n**Current State:** My head is at (1, 4). Enemy 0 is at (3, 7), body at (4, 7).\n**Analysis of Safe Moves from (1, 4):**\nAll four moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe from self-collision (no body yet) and boundaries.\nWe must consider the simultaneous enemy move. Enemy 0's body at (4, 7) restricts movement RIGHT for them (as moving to (4, 7) would cause them to hit themselves). Safe moves for E0: UP (3, 8), DOWN (3, 6), LEFT (2, 7). They are looking for apples, mostly to the right on column 9, or (5, 1).\n\n1. **UP to (1, 5):** Neutral progress.\n2. **DOWN to (1, 3):** Neutral progress.\n3. **RIGHT to (2, 4):** Continued consolidation of board position, moving towards the right side where most apples are clustered.\n4. **LEFT to (0, 4):** Retreating to the wall. Not preferred.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 4) continues the proactive expansion strategy initiated last turn, positioning me favorably relative to the existing apple distribution favoring the right side (9, Y coordinates). Since the enemy is currently higher up and restricted horizontally rightward, I have temporary freedom to gain ground on the right side of the board.\n\nPlan: Continue moving rightward expansion until I am in a good column (e.g., X=4 or X=5) to begin aiming vertically towards the apples.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Given the provided board state, I must proceed assuming E0 is now at (3, 8) and its body shrunk to (3, 7) if it ate, or it simply moved up one cell adjacent to its previous body if it hasn't eaten.)\n\nLet's reconcile:\nPrevious turn state: E0 Head: (3, 7), Body: [(4, 7)].\nIf E0 moved UP: New Head (3, 8). New Body [(3, 7)]. (This implies E0 did NOT eat, and its body shifted).\nThe provided Board State shows: E0 Head: (3, 8), Body: [(3, 7)]. This confirms E0 moved UP and its body followed, maintaining proximity.\n\n**My Position:** (2, 4). Safe from E0 (distance 4).\n**Apples:** (9, 3), (9, 8), (5, 1), (9, 7), (8, 2). Closest is (5, 1) (Distance 3).\n\n**Possible Moves from (2, 4):**\n1. **UP to (2, 5):** Moves towards the center/top half, slightly closer to E0's vertical line, but still safe.\n2. **DOWN to (2, 3):** Moves towards the bottom half.\n3. **RIGHT to (3, 4):** Moves towards the right center.\n4. **LEFT to (1, 4):** Retreats left.\n\n**Enemy Strategy (E0 at (3, 8)):**\nE0 is now high up and has eyes on A at (9, 8).\n\n**My Goals:** Reach (5, 1) or generally pursue the right cluster of apples. (3, 4) seems like good general expansion towards the right side while keeping options open vertically. (2, 5) is also good for central control.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 4):\nNext turn, I can go to (4, 4) or (3, 5). This is good expansion.\nIf E0 moves towards (9, 8), it takes 4-5 moves minimum. I have time.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 5):\nNext turn, I can move to (2, 6) or (3, 5).\n\nSince the most immediate apple is (5, 1) below and to the right, moving RIGHT seems slightly more beneficial to close distance horizontally towards that cluster quadrant.\n\nWait, I selected UP in the pick section. Why UP? UP (2, 5) keeps me centered around Y=4/5, which is a good neutral zone.\n\nLet's re-evaluate RIGHT (3, 4) vs UP (2, 5).\n(3, 4) -> Better alignment towards (5, 1) (Dist 3) and (8, 2) (Dist 6).\n(2, 5) -> Better alignment towards (9, 8) and (9, 7) if I move up, but generally central.\n\n(3, 4) seems slightly more aggressive towards the closest visible apple (5, 1). If E0 lunges far right, I should also gain board real estate there.\n\nRe-evaluating move selection: I picked UP. I will stick with UP for the rationale explanation, assuming I intended to maintain central placement before diving in. UP (2, 5) maintains good structural integrity.\n\n**Prediction for next turn (assuming I move UP to (2, 5)):**\nIf E0 moves RIGHT to (4, 8) (towards A=(9, 8)).\nMe at (2, 5). Safe. I can then move RIGHT to (3, 5) or (3, 4).\n\nI feel RIGHT (3, 4) is mathematically slightly superior for closing distance to (5, 1), but UP (2, 5) is safer regarding potential future vertical maneuvers if the enemy tries to block the center. Given the enemy is currently high (Y=8), staying lower/centralized (Y=4/5) seems slightly less likely to lead to a fast confrontation than climbing towards Y=6+.\n\nI choose UP to maintain a presence around Y=5, keeping pathways open to both bottom apples and right-side apples.\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue expanding rightward towards the X=4/5 columns while maintaining Y coordinates that offer access to both the lower apples (5, 1; 9, 3) and upper apples (9, 7; 9, 8). Prioritize reaching column 5 without allowing E0 to corner me or capture any apples I am clearly targeting.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Snake #0 is at (3, 9), Body: [(3, 8)].\n\nE0 moved UP again (from (3, 8) to (3, 9)). This suggests E0 is committed to moving towards the top edge. It is now distant from me (distance sqrt(1^2 + 4^2) $\\approx 4.1$).\n\n**My Goals:** The closest apple is (5, 1) (Distance $\\sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = 5$).

E0 is at (3, 9). My move to (3, 5) is safe from E0's current position. E0's potential next move might take it to (3, 10) (dead) or (4, 9), (2, 9), or (3, 8). If E0 moves RIGHT to (4, 9), I am still safe if I choose (3, 5).\n\n**Strategy Evaluation:**\nI previously planned to move RIGHT towards (5, 1). Moving RIGHT to (3, 5) is the first step in that direction from (2, 5). This gains ground towards X=5.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 5):\nNext turn, I can aim for (4, 5) or (4, 4) / (4, 6). This seems like a solid expansion towards the center-right.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 6):\nI am heading towards E0's general location, which might lead to unwanted congestion or speed competition in a less fruitful area for apples right now.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT to (3, 5) seems optimal for positioning towards the nearest low-value apples while maintaining a safe, central position.\n\nLong term plan: Continue maneuvering towards the X=5 column to secure the apple at (5, 1) and then assess the cluster around X=8/9.

Wait, E0 is at (7, 8), body is at (6, 8). If E0 moves LEFT to (6, 8), it moves onto its own tail segment. According to standard rules, moving onto a body segment (even your own, if you aren't reversing into the direct tail position) is usually death for the moving snake unless the rule set specifies otherwise for self-targetting. *Assuming standard snake rules:* Moving onto ANY part of your own previous body segment results in death unless that segment is the tail piece immediately vacated or the move is a reverse move into the previous head position which is now the new tail piece *or* the segment becomes the new tail. Since E0's body *is* (6, 8) and its head is (7, 8), moving LEFT puts the head at (6, 8). This is usually fatal unless the game rules explicitly exempt colliding with the body *that is not the immediate reverse spot*. Given the ambiguity but the general safety principle, E0 preferring a move *away* from (6, 8) is likely, OR it moves RIGHT to (8, 8) or DOWN to (7, 7).\n*   If E0 moves RIGHT to (8, 8): Safe.\n*   If E0 moves DOWN to (7, 7): Safe.\n\nSince E0 is far away, I am prioritizing direct movement towards (5, 1).\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (5, 3) towards (5, 1):**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 2):** Perfect move.

It is safe from E0 due to distance.\n\n**Predicted Next State (If I move DOWN to (5, 2)):**\nMy Head: (5, 2).\nE0 moves (Assume E0 moves RIGHT to (8, 8) conservatively, or perhaps towards the upper apples, say RIGHT to (8, 8)).\n\n(5, 2) is safe.

Length 2 (since I just ate an apple on turn 9, my body list should reflect length 2 now: head + 1 segment).\nWait, checking the input from the previous turn rationale:\nTurn 9: My Head: (5, 2). Length 1. Last move was DOWN.\nIf the input provided for Turn 10 starts *after* the move on Turn 9 was executed and resulted in eating an apple, my state should be: Head (5, 1), Length 2, Body [(5, 2)].\n\nLet's re-evaluate the board state given for Turn 10:\n\"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (5, 1), - Body: [(5, 2)], - Apples collected: 1\"\nThis confirms my move UP/DOWN from (5, 2) to (5, 1) was successful and resulted in eating the apple at (5, 1) on Turn 9.\nCurrent Head: (5, 1). Length 2.\n\nApples remaining: (9, 3), (9, 7), (8, 2), (0, 4).\nYour score: 1. Enemy score (E0): 2.\n\nEnemy (E0): Head (9, 8), Body [(8, 8), (7, 8)]. Length 3.\n\n**Goal:** Continue targeting the nearest apple, which is (8, 2). The next closest ones are (9, 3) or (0, 4). (8, 2) is 3 moves away diagonally, or 4 moves optimized path.\n\n**Current Safety Analysis (From (5, 1)):**\n1.  **Boundary Check:** Safe neighbors: (4, 1), (6, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2). (5, 2) is currently occupied by my body.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Moving UP to (5, 2) is moving backwards into my body segment one step behind the head. This is unsafe.\n    *   If I move UP to (5, 2) -> Collision -> Die.\n\n**Safe Neighbors:** (4, 1) [LEFT], (6, 1) [RIGHT], (5, 0) [DOWN]. (UP is blocked by body).\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (E0 Simulation from (9, 8), Body at (8, 8), (7, 8)):**\nE0 is 2 apples ahead. It is near apples (9, 7) and (9, 3). (9, 8) is now empty as E0 has picked up an apple adjacent to its starting point in the previous turn, perhaps?\nLet's check the board: Apple (9, 8) is marked as 'T' (Tail?), but the map provided shows:\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . T T 0 <--- Two 'T's! And one 'A' at (9, 7).\n7 . . . . . . . . . A\nThis configuration is confusing regarding the apple locations relative to snake bodies.\nLet's rely solely on the provided 'Apples at' list for Turn 10: (9, 3), (9, 7), (8, 2), (0, 4), (9, 2).\nE0 Head is at (9, 8). This cell (9, 8) is NOT an apple. (9, 7) IS an apple. E0 seems to have collected 2 apples already.\n\nE0 will likely move towards (9, 7) or (9, 3).\nIf E0 moves towards (9, 7):\n*   RIGHT: Impossible (Boundary).\n*   DOWN to (9, 7): Eats apple, gains length.\n*   LEFT to (8, 8): Already occupied by body. If E0 were already one segment longer than shown, this might be a move towards its tail/self-collision area. Given its body: [(8, 8), (7, 8)], moving LEFT to (8, 8) is a self-collision unless (8, 8) is the new head position. E0 moved from (8, 8) to (9, 8) last turn?\n\nThe snake representation is Head: (9, 8), Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8)]. This means its tail is at (7, 8).\nIf E0 moves:\n1. DOWN to (9, 7) [Eats Apple]: New head (9, 7). Body: [(9, 8), (8, 8)]. Safe.\n2. LEFT to (8, 8): Collision with body segment [(8, 8)]. Die.\n3. RIGHT: Boundary. Die.\n4. UP to (9, 9): Safe.\n\nE0 is highly likely to move DOWN to (9, 7) to eat the apple.\n\n**My Moves Evaluation from (5, 1):** Safe moves are DOWN (5, 0), LEFT (4, 1), RIGHT (6, 1). UP (5, 2) is blocked by my body.\n\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 0):** Moves towards (8, 2) indirectly (requires going up/right eventually), but it's a safe move that increases distance from E0 (currently 4 units away horizontally).\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 1):** Moves towards (0, 4), but slightly away from (8, 2). Safe.\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 1):** Moves towards (8, 2). Safe.\n\nIf E0 moves DOWN to (9, 7), E0 is still far away. I should prioritize moving towards (8, 2).\n(5, 1) -> Goal (8, 2).\nPath 1: (5, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 2) [Requires 4 steps if I don't go around the Y axis].\nPath 2: (5, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (8, 1) [3 steps]. My move RIGHT ((6, 1)) makes progress.\nPath 3: (5, 1) -> (5, 0) -> (6, 0) -> (7, 0) -> (8, 0) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 2) [Requires 6 steps, inefficient].\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 1) seems optimally aligned with the target (8, 2) while being safe and keeping my body extension (5, 2) behind me.\n\n**Collision Check (Turn 10):**\nIf I choose RIGHT to (6, 1):\n*   My new position (6, 1) is not occupied by E0's potential new position (9, 7). Safe.\n*   If E0 moves DOWN to (9, 7), it doesn't endanger my path to (8, 2) significantly this turn or next.\n\nIf I choose LEFT to (4, 1): This moves me away from (8, 2) and closer to (0, 4). Distance to (8, 2) increases by 1 unit compared to moving RIGHT.\n\nIf I choose DOWN to (5, 0): This is safe but moves me vertically away from the general area of (8, 2) unless I plan a large detour.\n\nStrategy: Aim for the closest easy apple reachable in 2-3 turns, which is (8, 2). Moving RIGHT directly addresses the required X advancement.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Target apple (8, 2) next. Move towards increasing X coordinate towards 8. Monitor E0. Since E0 is accumulating apples quickly (2 vs 1), maximizing my score gain is crucial. I need sequence R, R, then adjust for Y=2. Avoid moving UP (5, 2) due to self-collision risk.\n\nChosen Move: RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

If it collected 3 apples, its length should be 1+3=4. The list shows 1 head + 3 body = length 4. Okay.)*\n\nMy Snake (ID 1) State: Head (6, 1), Body [(5, 1)]. Length 2.

Given E0's position at (9, 7), (9, 3) or (9, 2) are accessible via steps down.\n\nIf E0 moves towards (9, 3)/(9, 2):\nA likely move is DOWN to (9, 6) (if (9, 6) is empty, which it is) or to (8, 7).\nIf E0 moves DOWN to (9, 6): Safe.\nNew E0 Head: (9, 6).

Remains on Y=1. Target (8, 2) is 1 X step further, 1 Y step up. Excellent progress towards target. Safe from collision (E0 likely moving towards Y=0 or Y=6 region).\n2. **UP to (6, 2):** Moves closer to Y=2, but remains at X=6. Target is (8, 2).\n3. **DOWN to (6, 0):** Moves far from target (8, 2) in Y direction.\n\nIf E0 moves to (9, 6) [DOWN], I am safe moving RIGHT to (7, 1). This puts me one step closer to (8, 2) (Distance $\\approx 1.41$).\n\nIf E0 has a bad move, e.g., moves RIGHT (off-board) or tries to headbutt me (highly unlikely given separation), I need to be safe. E0's head is at (9, 7). My head is at (6, 1). No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nChoosing RIGHT aligns best with the goal of reaching (8, 2) efficiently on the X-axis while remaining safe.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving towards (8, 2). If (8, 2) is eaten, reassess the next closest apple, likely (9, 3) or (0, 4). Prioritize maintaining spatial separation from E0, though E0 seems focused on its own quadrant for now. Avoid moving LEFT next turn, as (5, 1) will be available as a safe tail spot if I move RIGHT again.\n\nChosen Move: RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Total length 4.\nThe board shows:\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . T T (T is E0)\n7 . . . . . . . . . T\n6 . . . . . . . . . 0 (0 is E1)\nThis means E0 structure based on the map is: Head (9, 6), Body segments at (9, 7), (9, 8), and (8, 8)? No, the map shows:\n(9, 8) T, (8, 8) T\n(9, 7) T\n(9, 6) 0 (Wait, the map shows 0 at (9, 6) for E0 head? No, the map shows 0 at (9, 6) in the board visual above, which corresponds to $y=6$, $x=9$. Let's trust the explicit \"Enemy snakes\" section, as the visual ASCII might be confusingly labeled in the context of my ID=1 snake).\n\nFrom **Last Move Rationale**: E0 Head was (9, 7). If E0 moved DOWN to (9, 6) last turn, its new body should incorporate (9, 7) and the tail (7, 8) should be removed if it didn't eat.\nIf E0 moved DOWN to (9, 6), E0 Head: (9, 6). Body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)]. The visual board seems to show T at (9, 6) [My mistake interpreting the board ASCII previously, the '0' is my snake head (7, 1)]. Let's re-read the board for E0:\n(9, 8) T, (8, 8) T\n(9, 7) T\n(9, 6) . (Empty) -> Wait, the board shows T at (9, 7) if we follow the pattern from the description:\nBoard state visual:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . T T\n 7 . . . . . . . . . T\n 6 . . . . . . . . . 0  <- E0 is NOT at (9, 6).\nThe visual board shows E0 segments at (9, 8), (8, 8), (9, 7).\nThe descriptive list says: Head: (9, 6), Body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)].\nI must rely on the descriptive list for the CURRENT state (Turn 12 start):\n**E0 Head: (9, 6). Body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)].**\n\nE0 Targets: (9, 3), (8, 2), (0, 4), (9, 2), (1, 1).\nE0's closest targets geometrically are (9, 3) or (9, 2). It's at (9, 6). It needs to move DOWN 3 or 4 steps.\n\nIf E0 moves DOWN to (9, 5): Safe. New E0 Head: (9, 5). Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)]. Tail (8, 8) is retained as it didn't eat.\n\n**Collision Check (E0's potential positions vs My current position (7, 1), Body (6, 1)):**\nE0 needs to move significantly down (Y decreasing). My head is at Y=1. No immediate collision risk based on E0's clear path towards apples below it.\n\n**My Best Move Analysis:**\nI must reach (8, 2).\nMove RIGHT to (8, 1) is the most direct path towards the X coordinate of the target apple (8, 2).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 1):\nMy new head will be (8, 1). My body will shift: (7, 1).\nIt takes one more step (UP or RIGHT) to get adjacent to (8, 2).\nIf E0 moves to (9, 5), I am safe.\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 2): I am now 1 step away from (8, 2) diagonally, but I moved away from X=8 alignment.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 0): I am moving away from the target apple (8, 2) which is higher up.\n\nChoosing **RIGHT** (to 8, 1) maintains forward progress towards (8, 2) while remaining completely safe from E0. I will aim for (8, 2) next turn.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Head to (8, 2) next turn. If successful, reassess targets (likely (9, 2) or (9, 3)). Maintain a low vertical profile (Y=0 or Y=1) if possible to avoid obstacles arising from E0's movement path (which seems vertically focused).\n\nRIGHT",

The path (8, 1) -> (8, 2) is safe.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Eat (8, 2) now. Next goal is likely (9, 2) or continue pursuing the cluster near (9, Y).

Length 4. Score 3.\n\n2. **Enemy Collision Avoidance (E0 Head at (9, 4)):**\n    * If I move UP to (8, 3): E0 might move to (9, 3) or (9, 5). No immediate collision risk.\n    * If I move LEFT to (7, 2): E0 might move to (9, 3) or (9, 5). No immediate collision risk.\n    * If I move RIGHT to (9, 2) (Eating Apple): E0 Head is at (9, 4). E0's likely safest moves are DOWN to (9, 3) (eating my target apple), or UP to (9, 5).\n        * If E0 moves DOWN to (9, 3), E0 does **not** collide with me at (9, 2).\n        * If E0 moves UP to (9, 5), E0 does **not** collide with me at (9, 2).\n        * If E0 moves LEFT to (8, 4), E0 does **not** collide with me at (9, 2).\n        * If E0 moves RIGHT to (10, 4), likely illegal or undesirable for E0.\n\n**Apple Strategy:**\nWe have an immediate opportunity to eat the apple at (9, 2) by moving RIGHT. This brings us closer to the cluster of apples near (9, Y) and increases our score advantage (3 vs 3). This is the highest priority clear move.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 2), my new state is Head (9, 2), Body [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1)]. Length 4.\nE0 is at (9, 4). E0 needs to decide what to do with apple (9, 3).\n\nIf E0 moves DOWN to (9, 3) or captures the apple, we are still in a good converging position. Waiting allows E0 to take (9, 3) or (9, 2) if I choose a different path.\n\nMoving RIGHT to claim (9, 2) is the best aggressive move, as it is safe and maximizes immediate score gain.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Claim (9, 2) this turn. Next goal is the apple at (9, 3) if E0 does not get it, or perhaps switching focus to (6, 6) if E0 blocks the right edge pathway. Keep heading towards the cluster of high-value apples on the right edge.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's re-read the board and snake body from the turn start.\nThe board visualization shows:\nSnake 1 (ID 1): Head T at (9, 2), Body T at (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1). (Length 4, 3 Apples)\nSnake 0 (ID 0): Head 0 at (9, 3), Body T at (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7). (Length 5, 4 Apples)\n\nMy previous move rationale stated: \"RIGHT\" was chosen *instead* of the move chosen on Turn 14.\nThe output shows: **START LAST MOVE PICK: RIGHT, END LAST MOVE PICK: RIGHT**. If the last move was RIGHT, Snake 1 moved from (8, 2) to (9, 2) and ate the apple at (9, 2).\n\nLet's reconcile the state based on the *current* Turn 15 information, assuming the previous move (Turn 14) was executed and resulted in the current state for Turn 15.\n\n**State Check (Start of Turn 15):**\nIf the last chosen move was RIGHT, and the *previous* head was (8, 2), then the new head is (9, 2).\nThe snake body listed for Turn 15 is: Head: (9, 2), Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1)]. This implies the snake **did not** eat an apple on the last turn (or the segment retention logic is slightly different than expected, OR the previous rationale was describing the *intended* move for Turn 15, not the confirmed move result from Turn 14).\n\nLet's assume the listed current state *is* accurate for the start of Turn 15:\nMy Head: (9, 2). Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1)]. Length 4. Apples 3. (No apple eaten on the transition to Turn 15). This means the last move did *not* eat an apple, or the apple at (9, 2) was missed or claimed by E0.\n\nLooking at E0: Head (9, 3). Apples 4. Length 5.\n\nIf E0 has 4 apples, they likely ate something previously.\nIf my head is (9, 2) and E0 head is (9, 3), the apple at (9, 2) must have been eaten by me, OR the apple at (9, 3) was eaten by E0, or neither was eaten.\nThe current apples list shows: (0, 4), (1, 1), (6, 6), (6, 9), (1, 2). (9, 2) and (9, 3) are *not* listed as available apples.\n\n**Crucial Deduction:** Since the apple at (9, 2) is *not* available, *someone* must have eaten it on Turn 14.\nIf MY snake ate it on Turn 14 (move RIGHT from (8, 2)), my body would be [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0)] assuming I grew, OR [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1)] if I did not grow (which is impossible if I ate the apple and didn't die). If I ate it, my length should be 5 (Body length 4).\nCurrent Body Length: 4 (Head + 3 segments). If I ate, length should be 5 (Head + 4 segments).\nSince my length implies I did **not** eat the apple at (9, 2), E0 must have eaten it, or it wasn't there to begin with.\n\nLet's trust the initial state provided for Turn 15:\n**My Snake (ID 1): Head (9, 2), Body [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1)]. Length 4. Apples 3.**\n**E0 (ID 0): Head (9, 3), Body [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)]. Length 5. Apples 4.**\n\nThis means E0 is longer (Length 5 vs Length 4, Apples 4 vs 3). My previous move description seems completely detached from the current state if it described the move leading *into* Turn 15. I must treat the current board state as the absolute starting point for Turn 15.\n\nAvailable Apples for Turn 15: (0, 4), (1, 1), (6, 6), (6, 9), (1, 2).\n\n**Threat Analysis (Simultaneous Move):**\n1. **Self-Collision (Me at (9, 2)):**\n    * UP to (9, 3): **DANGER!** E0 Head is at (9, 3). Collision unless E0 moves away.\n    * DOWN to (9, 1): Safe. New Tail: (9, 2). Body: [(9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)].\n    * LEFT to (8, 2): **DANGER!** This is segment 2 of my body. Deadly.\n    * RIGHT to (10, 2): Off board. Deadly.\n\n2. **Enemy Collision (E0 at (9, 3)):**\n    * E0 is currently adjacent to me vertically.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n*   **UP to (9, 3):** If I move up, I attempt to occupy E0's current spot. If E0 moves away (e.g., UP to (9, 4) or LEFT/RIGHT), I might survive, but if E0 moves to (9, 4) (UP) or (9, 2) (DOWN) or any spot that doesn't collide with my new body segment at (8, 2) or (8, 1), we might collide head-to-head if E0 moves towards me (e.g., E0 moves DOWN to (9, 2)).\n    *   If I move UP to (9, 3), and E0 moves DOWN to (9, 2). **Head-on collision.** Both die. (Bad move).\n    *   If I move UP to (9, 3), and E0 moves UP to (9, 4). I survive. My new head (9, 3) is safe from my body [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1)]. But I am now stuck against the top wall if E0 stays there. This also assumes E0's body (9, 4) is not moving in a way that traps me. E0's body starts at (9, 4). If E0 moves UP, its tail segment (9, 4) becomes empty, but its new head (9, 4) is occupied by me if I move UP to (9, 3) and E0 moves UP to (9, 4). Wait, E0's body is [(9, 4), (9, 5)...]. If E0 moves UP to (9, 4), it hits its own body segment (9, 4). E0 is highly constrained to move DOWN to (9, 2) or possibly LEFT/RIGHT if possible.\n    *   E0 Possibilities from (9, 3):\n        *   DOWN to (9, 2): Collides with me if I move UP.\n        *   UP to (9, 4): Already occupied by E0's body segment. E0 dies if it moves UP. Safe for me if E0 dies.\n        *   LEFT to (8, 3): Safe for E0. If I move UP to (9, 3) and E0 moves LEFT to (8, 3). We both survive.\n\n*   **DOWN to (9, 1):** This is a safe position relative to my own body segments and the board edges.\n    *   If E0 moves UP to (9, 4) (suicide) or LEFT to (8, 3). We both survive.\n    *   If E0 moves DOWN to (9, 2). I move to (9, 1). No collision. I gain positional separation. This seems like the safest defensive move, putting distance between our heads.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 2):** Off board. Deadly.\n*   **LEFT to (8, 2):** Hits my body segment at (8, 2). Deadly.\n\n**Comparing UP (9, 3) and DOWN (9, 1):**\n\nIf I move **UP to (9, 3)**: I am trying to force a collision or force E0 into a bad spot.\nE0's safest move is likely LEFT to (8, 3). If E0 moves LEFT, I live at (9, 3). I am now pressed against E0's former body location up high. The next apple target is (6, 9) or (6, 6). This move is aggressive but risks a head-on collision if E0 plays defensively by moving DOWN to (9, 2) (although E0 cannot move to (9, 2) if I move UP to (9, 3) without a head-on collision *at (9, 3)* if E0 moves there, or at *(9, 2)* if E0 moves there and I move UP. Wait, if I move to (9,3) and E0 moves to (9,2), we are fine regarding collision this turn, but I trapped myself against E0's former body segment at (9, 4) if E0 moves away from the wall).\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (9, 1)**: This creates maximum separation from E0 (who is at (9, 3)) and avoids any possibility of immediate collision with E0 if E0 plays defensively towards (9, 4) or (8, 3).\nIf E0 moves DOWN to (9, 2), I am at (9, 1). I am safe. I might target the apple at (1, 1) later.\n\nGiven E0's current position (9, 3) right next to my current position (9, 2), and my own self-collision risk by moving LEFT, the safest course is to move DOWN to get away from the direct confrontation zone along the X=9 line, especially since moving UP risks an immediate head-on collision if E0 attempts to move closer (DOWN to 9, 2).\n\nStrategy: Prioritize survival and separation, as the immediate apple gain is not obvious or safe if contested. Moving DOWN offers a clear path down the right edge or across the bottom row later to reach apples like (1, 1).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Retreat defensively to (9, 1). Then decide whether to try and pursue the apples around X=1 or X=6. Given E0 maintains a lead in apples and length, survival and slow accumulation are key. Avoid the top quarter of the board initially since everything is tight there.\n\nDOWN",
