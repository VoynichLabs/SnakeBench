However, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake #1 at (9, 7) and the other snakes in the game.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the apple at (4, 1) which is relatively close and safe. I'll try to move left to get closer to it.\n\nI'll think out loud: If I move left, I'll be at (5, 1) which is still relatively safe. From there, I can assess the situation and decide my next move. If I'm lucky, I might even get to the apple at (4, 1) and grow.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT."
