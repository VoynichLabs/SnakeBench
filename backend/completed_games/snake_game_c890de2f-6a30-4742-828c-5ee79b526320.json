UP: Would move to (9, 9) - This is valid (still on board)\n2. DOWN: Would move to (9, 7) - This is valid\n3. LEFT: Would move to (8, 8) - This is valid\n4. RIGHT: Would move to (10, 8) - This is OFF THE BOARD - INVALID\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated immediately.\n\nNow I need to think about which apples to target. The closest apples to me:\n- (7, 1): Distance from (9, 8) = |9-7| + |8-1| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- (5, 2): Distance from (9, 8) = |9-5| + |8-2| = 4 + 6 = 10\n- (3, 0): Distance from (9, 8) = |9-3| + |8-0| = 6 + 8 = 14\n- (4, 3): Distance from (9, 8) = |9-4| + |8-3| = 5 + 5 = 10\n- (0, 4): Distance from (9, 8) = |9-0| + |8-4| = 9 + 4 = 13\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7, 2), which is very close to the apple at (7, 1) - just 1 step away. They'll likely go for that apple.\n\nThe closest apple to me is (7, 1) with distance 9, but the enemy is closer (distance 1).\n\nLet me think about which apples I can realistically get before the enemy:\n- (7, 1): Enemy is 1 step away, I'm 9 steps away - Enemy will get this\n- (5, 2): Enemy is 2 steps away (|7-5| + |2-2| = 2), I'm 10 steps away - Enemy could get this too\n- (4, 3): Enemy is 4 steps away (|7-4| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4), I'm 10 steps away\n- (3, 0): Enemy is 6 steps away (|7-3| + |2-0| = 4 + 2 = 6), I'm 14 steps away\n- (0, 4): Enemy is 9 steps away (|7-0| + |2-4| = 7 + 2 = 9), I'm 13 steps away\n\nSo the apple at (0, 4) might be competitive since the enemy is 9 steps away and I'm 13 steps away. But the enemy can potentially eat multiple apples on their way there.\n\nActually, let me recalculate. I'm at (9, 8) and the apple at (0, 4) is at distance 9 + 4 = 13. The enemy at (7, 2) to (0, 4) is 7 + 2 = 9 steps.\n\nHmm, the enemy seems closer to most apples. I should focus on getting apples as efficiently as possible while avoiding dangerous positions.\n\nLet me think about my immediate move:\n- UP (9, 9): Corner position, but safe for now\n- DOWN (9, 7): Moving toward the apples (most are in the lower half)\n- LEFT (8, 8): Moving toward the center and apples\n\nSince most apples are on the left side and lower half of the board, I should move LEFT or DOWN.\n\nMoving LEFT seems good because it:\n1. Moves me toward the center of the board (more options)\n2. Moves me closer to the apples\n\nMoving DOWN also:\n1. Moves me closer to the apples (which are mostly in the lower half)\n\nLet me think about the path to the nearest apple I might be able to compete for. \n\nThe apple at (4, 3) is at distance 10 from me. If I go:\n- LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT (5 moves to x=4), then DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN (5 moves to y=3)\n\nThat's 10 moves. But the enemy is 4 moves away from (4, 3). They could easily get it first.\n\nWhat about (0, 4)? I need 9 steps left and 4 steps down = 13 total. Enemy needs 7 + 2 = 9 steps.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me think strategically. The enemy will likely go DOWN to get (7, 1) first (1 step), then maybe continue to (5, 2) or (3, 0) or up to (4, 3).\n\nIf the enemy goes for (7, 1), then (5, 2), then (4, 3)... that's 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 moves to eat 3 apples along the way to (4, 3) area.\n\nI should probably aim for (0, 4) since it's in the opposite direction from where the enemy is likely going.\n\nTo get to (0, 4) from (9, 8):\n- I need to go left 9 times and down 4 times = 13 moves\n\nThe most direct path would involve mostly going left and mixing in some downs.\n\nFrom (9, 8):\n- LEFT to (8, 8)\n- Then continue left and down toward (0, 4)\n\nActually, I realize I should focus on the immediate decision. Given that:\n1. RIGHT is off the board (dead)\n2. UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe\n\nI should move either LEFT or DOWN to start making progress toward the apples. Moving UP would take me further from all apples.\n\nLet me go with LEFT to start moving toward the center of the board and the apples. This keeps my options open and makes progress toward the distant apples.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Going DOWN takes me from (9, 8) to (9, 7). Then I can continue going down and left to eventually reach apples. \n\nGoing LEFT takes me from (9, 8) to (8, 8). \n\nBoth are fine. I think LEFT is slightly better because:\n1. It moves me toward the center where I have more maneuverability\n2. It's the direction I'll need to go most (9 steps left vs 4-8 steps down to reach various apples)\n\nLet me go with LEFT.\n\nWait, I should also consider where the enemy might go. The enemy at (7, 2) is 1 step away from (7, 1). They'll almost certainly go DOWN to (7, 1) to eat the apple. That means next turn they'll be at (7, 1) with 1 apple.\n\nThis doesn't directly affect my immediate safety since we're far apart.\n\nMy plan: Move LEFT this turn, then continue moving left and down toward the apples on the left side of the board. Aim for (0, 4) or (4, 3) depending on the enemy's movements.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at this situation:\n\nMy head is at (9, 8) in the top-right corner. Let me analyze each direction:\n\n1. **RIGHT**: Would move to (10, 8) - OFF THE BOARD - DEATH\n2. **UP**: Would move to (9, 9) - Safe but moves me into the corner, further from all apples\n3. **DOWN**: Would move to (9, 7) - Safe, moves toward apples\n4. **LEFT**: Would move to (8, 8) - Safe, moves toward apples and center\n\nThe enemy snake at (7, 2) is positioned very close to the apple at (7, 1) - just 1 step away. They'll likely grab that apple immediately.\n\nLooking at apple distances from my position (9, 8):\n- (7, 1): 9 steps - enemy is 1 step away\n- (5, 2): 10 steps - enemy is 2 steps away  \n- (4, 3): 10 steps - enemy is 4 steps away\n- (3, 0): 14 steps - enemy is 6 steps away\n- (0, 4): 13 steps - enemy is 9 steps away\n\nThe enemy will likely sweep up the apples in the bottom-center. My best strategy is to head toward the apple at (0, 4) on the left side, which is furthest from the enemy's likely path.\n\n**Strategy note for future turns**: Head toward (0, 4) by moving left and down. The enemy will likely collect apples in the center-bottom area, so focus on the left side of the board. Keep options open by staying near the center when possible.\n\nTo reach (0, 4), I need to go left 9 times and down 4 times. Starting with LEFT makes the most progress and keeps me away from the corner.\n\nLEFT",

A . . . . . .  <- Apple at (3, 0)\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head is at (8, 8). Let me consider each direction:\n\n1. UP: Would move to (8, 9) - Valid, but moves me further from apples\n2. DOWN: Would move to (8, 7) - Valid, moves toward apples\n3. LEFT: Would move to (7, 8) - Valid, moves toward center and apples\n4. RIGHT: Would move to (9, 8) - Valid, but corner area\n\nAll four moves are valid (none go off the board, and I have no body to collide with).\n\nNow let me think about strategy:\n\nThe enemy was at (7, 2) last turn and is now at (6, 2). They moved LEFT. This suggests they might be going for the apple at (5, 2) which is right next to them (1 step away).\n\nIf the enemy is going for (5, 2), they'll likely continue LEFT to (5, 2) this turn.\n\nLet me calculate distances to apples from my current position (8, 8):\n- (7, 1): |8-7| + |8-1| = 1 + 7 = 8 steps\n- (5, 2): |8-5| + |8-2| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps\n- (3, 0): |8-3| + |8-0| = 5 + 8 = 13 steps\n- (4, 3): |8-4| + |8-3| = 4 + 5 = 9 steps\n- (0, 4): |8-0| + |8-4| = 8 + 4 = 12 steps\n\nEnemy at (6, 2) distances:\n- (7, 1): |6-7| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps\n- (5, 2): |6-5| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1 step\n- (3, 0): |6-3| + |2-0| = 3 + 2 = 5 steps\n- (4, 3): |6-4| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps\n- (0, 4): |6-0| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8 steps\n\nThe enemy is much closer to the apples at (5, 2), (7, 1), (4, 3), and (3, 0). The apple at (0, 4) is 8 steps for enemy vs 12 for me - still closer to the enemy but the gap is smaller.\n\nGiven the enemy's likely path: (5, 2) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (3, 0) or similar, they'll sweep up the center-bottom apples.\n\nMy best bet is still to go for (0, 4) on the far left, or try to intercept (7, 1) which is 8 steps away and the enemy is 2 steps away from. Wait, the enemy is 2 steps from (7, 1) but 1 step from (5, 2). They'll probably go for (5, 2) first.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The closest apple to me is (7, 1) at 8 steps. If I head there:\n- Path: LEFT to (7, 8), then DOWN 7 times to reach (7, 1)\n- That's exactly 8 moves\n\nThe enemy could reach (7, 1) in 2 moves. So they'd get there in turn 3 if they went directly. But if they go for (5, 2) first (1 step), then to (7, 1) that's 1 + 3 = 4 steps, reaching by turn 5.\n\nI'd need 8 moves to reach (7, 1), so I'd be there by turn 9. The enemy would beat me there regardless.\n\nWhat if I go for (4, 3)?\n- Distance: 9 steps\n- Path: LEFT 4 times to x=4, DOWN 5 times to y=3\n\nThe enemy at (6, 2) is 3 steps from (4, 3). They'd get there by turn 4 at the earliest.\n\nLet me think about (0, 4):\n- I need 8 steps left and 4 steps down = 12 moves total\n- Enemy needs 6 steps left and 2 steps up = 8 moves\n\nStill the enemy is closer, but they'll likely eat other apples along the way, giving me time.\n\nLooking at my immediate options:\n- UP (8, 9): Moves away from all apples - bad choice\n- RIGHT (9, 8): Moves toward corner, away from apples - bad choice\n- DOWN (8, 7): Moves toward apples\n- LEFT (7, 8): Moves toward apples and center\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are good. Let me think about which is better.\n\nIf I'm aiming for (0, 4), I need to go:\n- 8 steps left (from x=8 to x=0)\n- 4 steps down (from y=8 to y=4)\n\nSo I need more left moves than down moves. Going LEFT makes more progress toward my goal.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the closest apple (7, 1):\n- 1 step left (from x=8 to x=7)\n- 7 steps down (from y=8 to y=1)\n\nGoing DOWN would help for this apple.\n\nBut the enemy will likely get (7, 1) first. Let me prioritize (0, 4) since it's the furthest from the enemy's likely path.\n\nI'll continue with LEFT to make progress toward (0, 4).\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the apple at (7, 1). The enemy moved from (7, 2) to (6, 2) - they went LEFT. This means they're moving away from (7, 1). If they're heading to (5, 2) first, then maybe to (4, 3), I might have a shot at (7, 1).\n\nFrom (8, 8) to (7, 1):\n- Turn 2: LEFT to (7, 8)\n- Turn 3-9: DOWN 7 times to (7, 1)\n- Total: 8 turns, arrive turn 9\n\nEnemy at (6, 2):\n- If they go to (5, 2): Turn 2 at (5, 2)\n- Then to (4, 3): Turn 4 at (4, 3) (2 moves)\n- Then maybe to (3, 0): Turn 7 at (3, 0) (3 moves)\n- Then to (7, 1): Turn 11 at (7, 1) (4 moves)\n\nHmm, if the enemy collects (5, 2), (4, 3), and (3, 0) first, I could potentially get to (7, 1) by turn 9, before they reach it (turn 11).\n\nBut this is risky. Let me stick with going for (0, 4) as my primary target since it's in the opposite direction.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the path. Going LEFT from (8, 8) to (7, 8) puts me on track to either:\n1. Go to (0, 4) - continue left and mix in some downs\n2. Go to (7, 1) - go straight down\n\nLEFT keeps both options open! If I go DOWN first to (8, 7), I'm not making progress toward (0, 4) as efficiently.\n\nI'll go LEFT.\n\n**Strategy note for future turns**: Continue heading toward (0, 4) by going left. If the enemy clears out the center-bottom apples and heads elsewhere, consider pivoting to (7, 1) or other available apples. Monitor enemy position to avoid head-on collisions.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\nMy head is at (8, 8). The enemy has moved from (7, 2) to (6, 2) - they went LEFT, likely heading toward the apple at (5, 2) which is just 1 step away from them now.\n\nLet me evaluate my options:\n1. **UP (8, 9)**: Safe but moves me further from all apples - poor choice\n2. **DOWN (8, 7)**: Safe, moves toward apples\n3. **LEFT (7, 8)**: Safe, moves toward center and apples\n4. **RIGHT (9, 8)**: Safe but moves toward corner, away from apples - poor choice\n\nApple analysis from (8, 8):\n- (7, 1): 8 steps - enemy can reach in ~2 steps if they pivot\n- (5, 2): 9 steps - enemy is 1 step away, will get this\n- (4, 3): 9 steps - enemy is 3 steps away\n- (3, 0): 13 steps - enemy is 5 steps away\n- (0, 4): 12 steps - enemy is 8 steps away (furthest from their path)\n\nThe enemy will likely sweep up (5, 2) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (3, 0). My best strategy is to target (0, 4) on the far left, which is furthest from their likely path.\n\nTo reach (0, 4), I need 8 steps left and 4 steps down. Going LEFT makes more progress toward this goal and keeps my options open - I can still pivot to (7, 1) later if the enemy goes elsewhere.\n\n**Strategy for next turns**: Continue heading left toward (0, 4). The enemy will likely collect center-bottom apples. After securing (0, 4), reassess based on remaining apples and enemy position.\n\nLEFT",

Let me re-read...\n\nActually, looking at the board, the enemy is at (6, 1) now, and the apple at (7, 1) is just 1 step to the right of the enemy. \n\nLet me reconsider my options:\n\nFrom (7, 8), my possible moves:\n1. UP: (7, 9) - Valid, moves away from apples\n2. DOWN: (7, 7) - Valid, moves toward apples\n3. LEFT: (6, 8) - Valid, moves toward center\n4. RIGHT: (8, 8) - Valid\n\nAll four moves are safe (no body, no walls).\n\nNow, let me think about the enemy. The enemy is at (6, 1) and is just 1 step away from the apple at (7, 1). They'll likely move RIGHT to get that apple this turn.\n\nLet me calculate distances from my position (7, 8) to each apple:\n- (7, 1): |7-7| + |8-1| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps - directly below me!\n- (5, 2): |7-5| + |8-2| = 2 + 6 = 8 steps\n- (3, 0): |7-3| + |8-0| = 4 + 8 = 12 steps\n- (4, 3): |7-4| + |8-3| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps\n- (0, 4): |7-0| + |8-4| = 7 + 4 = 11 steps\n\nEnemy at (6, 1) distances:\n- (7, 1): |6-7| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1 step - they'll likely get this!\n- (5, 2): |6-5| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps\n- (3, 0): |6-3| + |1-0| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps\n- (4, 3): |6-4| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps\n- (0, 4): |6-0| + |1-4| = 6 + 3 = 9 steps\n\nThe enemy will likely grab (7, 1) this turn (1 step), then maybe (5, 2) next (2 more steps), then possibly (3, 0) or (4, 3).\n\nWait, the apple at (7, 1) is directly below me! It's 7 steps down from my position. If I go DOWN, I can head straight for it. But the enemy is 1 step away and will beat me there.\n\nLet me think about what apple I can realistically get:\n\nIf enemy gets (7, 1) this turn, then:\n- (5, 2): Enemy is 2 steps away after eating (7, 1)... actually wait, after eating (7, 1), enemy will be at (7, 1). From there to (5, 2) is |7-5| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps.\n- I'm 8 steps from (5, 2)\n\nSo enemy would reach (5, 2) by turn 4 (turn 2 to get (7,1), then 3 more turns to get (5,2) = turn 5)\n\nHmm, the enemy is closer to most apples.\n\nWhat about (0, 4)? \n- I'm 11 steps away\n- Enemy (at (7, 1) after eating apple) would be |7-0| + |1-4| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps away\n\nBut they'll likely collect other apples first, so I might have a shot at (0, 4).\n\nActually, what if I go for (4, 3)? I'm 8 steps away. If the enemy goes (7,1) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (4,3), that's:\n- Turn 2: enemy at (7,1)\n- Turn 5: enemy at (5,2) (3 more steps)\n- From (5,2) to (4,3): |5-4| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps, so turn 7\n\nIf I head straight for (4, 3) from (7, 8):\n- Need to go left 3 and down 5\n- I could reach by turn 10 (8 steps)\n\nStill won't beat them.\n\nWhat about (3, 0)?\n- I'm 12 steps away\n- Enemy at (7,1) is 4 steps away, so turn 6 if they go there directly\n\nLet me think differently. The apple at (0, 4) is the furthest from the enemy's starting position and their likely path. If I head there aggressively, I might be able to secure it.\n\nFrom (7, 8) to (0, 4):\n- Need to go left 7 and down 4\n- Total: 11 steps\n\nEnemy at (6, 1) to (0, 4):\n- Need to go left 6 and up 3\n- Total: 9 steps\n\nBut if enemy goes for closer apples first:\n- (7, 1) at turn 2\n- (5, 2) at turn 5\n- (4, 3) at turn 7\n- (3, 0) at turn 10\n- Then (0, 4) at turn 14\n\nI can reach (0, 4) by turn 13 (11 steps from turn 2). So I might beat them there!\n\nOK so my strategy should be to head toward (0, 4). To do that, I need to go LEFT and DOWN.\n\nFrom (7, 8):\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 8)\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 7)\n\nBoth are valid. Going DOWN keeps me on the same x-coordinate as the apple at (7, 1), but the enemy will get that. Going LEFT moves me toward (0, 4).\n\nSince I need 7 left moves and 4 down moves to reach (0, 4), going LEFT makes more progress toward my goal.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the apple at (7, 1). It's directly below me (same x-coordinate). The enemy is at (6, 1) and might move RIGHT to (7, 1) to eat it. But what if they don't? What if they move to (5, 2) instead?\n\nFrom (6, 1) to (5, 2): LEFT and UP... that's 2 steps. But they could also go (6, 2) then (5, 2), which is UP then LEFT.\n\nActually, looking more carefully, from (6, 1), if they go LEFT they get to (5, 1), not (5, 2). To get to (5, 2), they'd need to go LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT.\n\nThe apple at (7, 1) is 1 step RIGHT from the enemy. If I were the enemy, I'd take the easy apple.\n\nSo enemy likely goes RIGHT to (7, 1) this turn.\n\nGiven that, my best move is to continue toward (0, 4). \n\nGoing LEFT to (6, 8).\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if there's any risk of collision. The enemy is at (6, 1) and will likely move to (7, 1). We're not close enough to collide.\n\nDecision: LEFT\n\nActually, let me double-check by considering DOWN. If I go DOWN to (7, 7), I'm moving toward the apples but the closest one (7, 1) will be taken by the enemy. After that, the next closest from (7, 7) would be... let me recalculate:\n- (5, 2): |7-5| + |7-2| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps\n- (4, 3): |7-4| + |7-3| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps\n- (3, 0): |7-3| + |7-0| = 4 + 7 = 11 steps\n- (0, 4): |7-0| + |7-4| = 7 + 3 = 10 steps\n\nFrom (6, 8) after going LEFT:\n- (5, 2): |6-5| + |8-2| = 1 + 6 = 7 steps\n- (4, 3): |6-4| + |8-3| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps\n- (3, 0): |6-3| + |8-0| = 3 + 8 = 11 steps\n- (0, 4): |6-0| + |8-4| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps\n\nThe distances are similar. Going LEFT vs DOWN doesn't make a huge difference for the nearest apples.\n\nBut thinking about (0, 4) specifically:\n- From (7, 7): need 7 left, 3 down = 10 total\n- From (6, 8): need 6 left, 4 down = 10 total\n\nBoth are 10 steps from (0, 4).\n\nHmm, let me think about future positioning. If I go LEFT, I'm at x=6, which is closer to the center and gives me more options. If I go DOWN, I'm still at x=7, which is further right.\n\nActually, the more I think about it, the key question is: what's my target apple?\n\nOptions:\n1. (0, 4) - furthest from enemy's likely path\n2. (4, 3) or (5, 2) - but enemy will likely get these\n\nIf I'm going for (0, 4), I should prioritize LEFT moves since I need 7 of them vs 4 DOWN moves.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the whole picture. The enemy might not follow the optimal path. What if I try to intercept them or go for different apples?\n\nLet's say I focus on (0, 4) and the enemy sweeps up the center-bottom apples. By the time I get (0, 4), the enemy might have 3-4 apples. Then new apples will spawn and I can try to compete.\n\nThis seems reasonable. Let me go LEFT.\n\n**Strategy note for future turns**: Head toward (0, 4) by going left. Continue left until x=0 or so, then go down to y=4. Monitor enemy position. After securing (0, 4), reassess based on remaining/new apples.\n\nLEFT\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n\nMy head is at (7, 8). The enemy has moved to (6, 1) - they're now just 1 step from the apple at (7, 1). They'll almost certainly move RIGHT to grab it this turn.\n\nLet me evaluate my options from (7, 8):\n1. **UP (7, 9)**: Safe, but moves away from all apples\n2. **DOWN (7, 7)**: Safe, moves toward apples\n3. **LEFT (6, 8)**: Safe, moves toward center and (0, 4)\n4. **RIGHT (8, 8)**: Safe, but moves away from most apples\n\nApple distances from (7, 8):\n- (7, 1): 7 steps - directly below me, but enemy will get it this turn\n- (5, 2): 8 steps - enemy will be 3 steps away after eating (7, 1)\n- (4, 3): 8 steps - enemy can reach in ~5 turns\n- (3, 0): 12 steps\n- (0, 4): 11 steps - furthest from enemy's likely path\n\nThe enemy will sweep up the center-bottom apples: (7, 1) \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (3, 0). My best bet is to target (0, 4), which they'll reach last.\n\nTo reach (0, 4), I need 7 steps left and 4 steps down. Going LEFT makes more progress toward this goal since I need more horizontal movement.\n\nNo collision risk - enemy is at (6, 1), far away, and will move to (7, 1).\n\n**Strategy for next turns**: Continue heading left toward (0, 4). The enemy will collect center-bottom apples. Once I secure (0, 4), reassess based on remaining apples and new spawns.\n\nLEFT",

They're also close to (5, 2) at 2 steps.\n\nGiven this, I should target apples the enemy is further from:\n- (4, 3) is 6 steps for me, 4 for enemy - enemy closer but not by much\n- (0, 4) is 9 steps for me, 9 for enemy - tie, but I'm coming from above which might be better\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully:\n- Enemy will likely grab (7, 1), then (5, 2), then maybe (3, 0) or (4, 3)\n- I should go for apples on the left side: (0, 4) or (4, 3)\n\n(4, 3) at 6 steps seems like a good target. To get there from (6, 7):\n- I need to go LEFT 2 and DOWN 4\n- Going DOWN gets me closer\n\nLet me think about the path to (4, 3):\nFrom (6, 7) -> DOWN -> (6, 6) -> DOWN -> (6, 5) -> DOWN -> (6, 4) -> DOWN -> (6, 3) -> LEFT -> (5, 3) -> LEFT -> (4, 3)\n\nOr I could go LEFT first then DOWN:\nFrom (6, 7) -> LEFT -> (5, 7) -> LEFT -> (4, 7) -> DOWN -> ... -> (4, 3)\n\nBoth are 6 steps total.\n\nActually, going DOWN now makes sense because:\n1. It moves me toward multiple apples (4, 3), (5, 2), and even (0, 4)\n2. It keeps my options open\n\nBut wait, enemy at (6, 1) might move UP toward (5, 2) after grabbing (7, 1). Let me think about collision risks.\n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 1) this turn, they're at (7, 1).\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 6), I'm at (6, 6).\nNo collision risk this turn.\n\nActually, looking at this again, the enemy is at (6, 1) and the apple (7, 1) is just 1 step to the RIGHT. They'll almost certainly grab it.\n\nAfter that, they might go for (5, 2) which is at distance 2 from (7, 1) (LEFT, UP).\n\nI should go for (4, 3) or (0, 4). Let me target (4, 3) since it's closer.\n\nMoving DOWN from (6, 7) to (6, 6) is a good choice - it moves me toward (4, 3).\n\nWait, I should also consider (5, 2). From (6, 7):\n- (5, 2): 1 left, 5 down = 6 steps\n- But enemy from (7, 1) after eating: 2 left, 1 up = 3 steps\n\nEnemy is closer to (5, 2) even after eating (7, 1). So I shouldn't contest that.\n\nLet me target (4, 3):\n- From (6, 7): 2 left, 4 down = 6 steps\n- Enemy from (7, 1): 3 left, 2 up = 5 steps... hmm, enemy might be closer\n\nWhat about (0, 4)?\n- From (6, 7): 6 left, 3 down = 9 steps\n- Enemy from (7, 1): 7 left, 3 up = 10 steps\n\nI'm slightly closer to (0, 4)! That might be my best bet.\n\nLet me reconsider my move:\n- To get to (0, 4) from (6, 7), I need to go 6 left and 3 down\n- Going LEFT would move me toward (0, 4)\n- Going DOWN would also work\n\nLEFT to (5, 7) or DOWN to (6, 6)?\n\nFrom (5, 7):\n- To (0, 4): 5 left, 3 down = 8 steps\n- To (4, 3): 1 left, 4 down = 5 steps\n\nFrom (6, 6):\n- To (0, 4): 6 left, 2 down = 8 steps\n- To (4, 3): 2 left, 3 down = 5 steps\n\nBoth give same distances essentially. But going LEFT keeps me away from the enemy who is on the right side.\n\nActually, let me just continue with my previous strategy. Going DOWN to (6, 6) moves me toward the apples in the lower half of the board. I can adjust my path based on enemy movements.\n\n**Move: DOWN**\n\nStrategy for next turns: Head toward (4, 3) or (0, 4) depending on enemy movements. The enemy will likely grab (7, 1) this turn, then (5, 2). I should avoid those contested apples and go for the ones on the left side.\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n\nMy head is at (6, 7). Enemy is at (6, 1) - just 1 step from the apple at (7, 1). They'll almost certainly move RIGHT to grab it this turn.\n\nLet me evaluate my options from (6, 7):\n1. **UP (6, 8)**: Safe, but moves away from all apples\n2. **DOWN (6, 6)**: Safe, moves toward apples\n3. **LEFT (5, 7)**: Safe, moves toward (0, 4) and (4, 3)\n4. **RIGHT (7, 7)**: Safe, but enemy controls the right side\n\nDistance analysis from my position:\n- (4, 3): 6 steps (2 left, 4 down)\n- (5, 2): 6 steps (1 left, 5 down) - but enemy will be close after getting (7, 1)\n- (0, 4): 9 steps (6 left, 3 down)\n\nThe enemy will likely sweep the right side apples: (7, 1) \u2192 (5, 2). I should target the left side apples where I have an advantage:\n- (0, 4) - I'm 9 steps away, enemy (after eating) would be ~10 steps\n- (4, 3) - I'm 6 steps away\n\nGoing DOWN moves me closer to both (4, 3) and (0, 4) while keeping my options open. From (6, 6), I can continue adjusting my path - either going more LEFT toward (0, 4) or heading toward (4, 3).\n\n**Strategy for next turns**: Continue moving toward (4, 3) as primary target. If enemy contests it, pivot to (0, 4). Avoid the right side where enemy is collecting apples.\n\nDOWN",

That's DOWN. Interesting - they moved away from (7, 1). Maybe they're going for (3, 0)?\n\nLet me check possible moves from my position at (6, 6):\n\n1. **UP (6, 7)**: Safe, moves away from apples\n2. **DOWN (6, 5)**: Safe, moves toward apples\n3. **LEFT (5, 6)**: Safe, moves toward left-side apples\n4. **RIGHT (7, 6)**: Safe, moves toward (7, 1)\n\nNo body segments to worry about.\n\nDistance analysis from (6, 6):\n- (7, 1): |6-7| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps\n- (5, 2): |6-5| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps\n- (3, 0): |6-3| + |6-0| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps\n- (4, 3): |6-4| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n- (0, 4): |6-0| + |6-4| = 6 + 2 = 8 steps\n\nEnemy at (6, 0) distances to apples:\n- (7, 1): |6-7| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps\n- (5, 2): |6-5| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps\n- (3, 0): |6-3| + |0-0| = 3 + 0 = 3 steps\n- (4, 3): |6-4| + |0-3| = 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n- (0, 4): |6-0| + |0-4| = 6 + 4 = 10 steps\n\nThe enemy is very close to:\n- (7, 1): 2 steps\n- (5, 2): 3 steps\n- (3, 0): 3 steps\n\nI'm closest to:\n- (4, 3): 5 steps (enemy also 5 steps - TIE!)\n- (5, 2): 5 steps (enemy 3 steps - enemy closer)\n- (0, 4): 8 steps (enemy 10 steps - I'm closer!)\n\nSo my best options are:\n1. (4, 3) - tied distance, but I'm coming from above which might be advantageous\n2. (0, 4) - I'm 2 steps closer\n\nThe enemy might go RIGHT to (7, 0) heading toward (7, 1), or LEFT toward (3, 0), or UP toward (5, 2).\n\nLet me focus on (4, 3) since it's closer. From (6, 6):\n- Need to go 2 LEFT and 3 DOWN\n- Path: (6, 6) \u2192 (5, 6) \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3)\n\nOr I could go DOWN first:\n- Path: (6, 6) \u2192 (6, 5) \u2192 (6, 4) \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 (4, 3)\n\nBoth are 5 steps.\n\nActually, let me think about what the enemy will do. They moved DOWN to (6, 0). The closest apples are:\n- (7, 1): RIGHT then UP = 2 steps\n- (3, 0): LEFT LEFT LEFT = 3 steps\n- (5, 2): LEFT then UP UP = 3 steps\n\nThey might be going for (7, 1) or (3, 0). If they go RIGHT to (7, 0) this turn, then UP to (7, 1) next turn, they grab that apple.\n\nGiven this, I should probably target apples the enemy is further from. (0, 4) is the safest bet where I have a 2-step advantage.\n\nBut (4, 3) is closer overall and we're tied. If I move efficiently toward it, I might beat the enemy there if they go for other apples first.\n\nLet me think about the path:\n- To (4, 3) going LEFT first: (6, 6) \u2192 (5, 6) \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3) = 5 turns\n- To (4, 3) going DOWN first: (6, 6) \u2192 (6, 5) \u2192 (6, 4) \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 (4, 3) = 5 turns\n\nEnemy to (4, 3) from (6, 0):\n- (6, 0) \u2192 (5, 0) \u2192 (4, 0) \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 (4, 2) \u2192 (4, 3) = 5 turns\nOR\n- (6, 0) \u2192 (6, 1) \u2192 (6, 2) \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 (4, 3) = 5 turns\n\nIt's a true tie! But the enemy is closer to other apples, so they'll probably go for those first, giving me the advantage at (4, 3).\n\nIf enemy goes for (7, 1):\n- (6, 0) \u2192 (7, 0) \u2192 (7, 1) = 2 turns for apple\n- Then to (4, 3) from (7, 1): |7-4| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5 more turns\n\nSo if enemy goes for (7, 1), I have a 2-turn head start to (4, 3)!\n\nMoving LEFT toward (4, 3) seems like a good strategy. Let me go LEFT to (5, 6).\n\nWait, let me also consider going DOWN to get to (4, 3) by a different path. If I go DOWN to (6, 5), then LEFT LEFT to (4, 5), then DOWN DOWN to (4, 3).\n\nBoth paths are equally efficient. But going LEFT first keeps me higher up on the board, away from where the enemy is operating (bottom of board).\n\nActually, looking at my last rationale, I mentioned going toward (4, 3). Let me continue that plan.\n\nGoing LEFT to (5, 6):\n- Gets me closer to (4, 3): now 4 steps away\n- Gets me closer to (0, 4): now 7 steps away\n- Still safe and keeps options open\n\nGoing DOWN to (6, 5):\n- Gets me closer to (4, 3): now 4 steps away (same)\n- (0, 4): still 8 steps... wait, |6-0| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7 steps\n\nBoth moves give me 4 steps to (4, 3) and 7 steps to (0, 4).\n\nI'll go with LEFT because it moves me away from the enemy's likely path and keeps me in a safer area of the board.\n\n**Move: LEFT**\n\nStrategy for next turns: Continue toward (4, 3). Path: (5, 6) \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3). If enemy contests this, pivot to (0, 4). Watch enemy movements - they're likely going for (7, 1) or the bottom apples.\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n\nMy head is at (6, 6). Enemy moved DOWN to (6, 0) - interesting, they're now at the bottom of the board.\n\nLet me check my safe moves from (6, 6):\n- UP (6, 7): Safe\n- DOWN (6, 5): Safe  \n- LEFT (5, 6): Safe\n- RIGHT (7, 6): Safe\n\nAll moves are safe since I have no body.\n\nDistance analysis from (6, 6):\n- (4, 3): 5 steps - tied with enemy, but enemy is closer to other apples first\n- (5, 2): 5 steps - enemy is 3 steps away (enemy advantage)\n- (0, 4): 8 steps - enemy is 10 steps (I have 2-step advantage!)\n- (7, 1): 6 steps - enemy is 2 steps (enemy advantage)\n- (3, 0): 9 steps - enemy is 3 steps (enemy advantage)\n\nThe enemy at (6, 0) will likely go for the nearby apples: (7, 1), (3, 0), or (5, 2). They're much closer to all of those.\n\nMy best targets are:\n1. (4, 3) - if enemy goes for (7, 1) first, I have a 2-turn head start\n2. (0, 4) - I'm definitively closer here\n\nGoing LEFT to (5, 6) moves me toward (4, 3):\n- New distance to (4, 3): 4 steps (1 left, 3 down)\n- Keeps me in the upper part of the board, away from enemy activity\n- Path: (5, 6) \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3)\n\n**Strategy for next turns**: Continue toward (4, 3) via the path above. Enemy will likely grab bottom apples first, giving me time. If enemy contests (4, 3), pivot to (0, 4).\n\nLEFT",
