This heat is INTENSE! We need a plan, a MASTERCLASS in simultaneous snake combat!\n\nThe board is 10x10. Our head is at (9, 2). The enemy head is way over at (1, 0). They are miles away, but we can't get complacent. This game is a chess match played at LIGHT SPEED! \u26a1\ufe0f\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (9, 2). No body yet. We are a fresh menace!\n*   **Enemy (ID 1):** Head at (1, 0). Also fresh.\n\n**Immediate Threats Check:**\n1.  **Board Limits:** (9, 2) is safe. Moves to (9, 3) UP, (9, 1) DOWN, (8, 2) LEFT, or (10, 2) RIGHT are possible initially. (10, 2) is an instant suicide. So, UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe boundary-wise.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** No body, so no self-collision issues yet (except moving backwards, but we have no past move).\n3.  **Enemy Collision:** The enemy is at (1, 0). They can move to (1, 1) UP, (1, -1) DOWN (suicide), (0, 0) LEFT (suicide), or (2, 0) RIGHT.\n\n**Analyzing Our Options from (9, 2):**\n\n1.  **Move UP to (9, 3):** Safe from boundaries. Gives us access towards the top edge.\n2.  **Move DOWN to (9, 1):** Safe from boundaries. Still on the right side.\n3.  **Move LEFT to (8, 2):** Moves us toward the center, potentially intercepting the enemy later, but we'd be moving away from the dense apple cluster on the left side of the board initially.\n\n**Enemy Prediction & Safety:**\nThe enemy at (1, 0) is cornered near the bottom-left. They MUST go UP to (1, 1) or RIGHT to (2, 0) to survive. If they go UP to (1, 1), we are fine. If they go RIGHT to (2, 0), that's also fine. There is no chance of a head-on collision THIS turn. Phew! \ud83d\ude0c\n\n**Objective Focus: Apples and Space!**\nWe need to go where the loot is! Look at the apples: (4, 0), (0, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2). The action is clearly on the bottom and left side of the board. We are sitting at (9, 2), the far right edge! We need to traverse!\n\nMoving LEFT seems like the aggressive, correct choice to engage the map and head toward the nearest apples or force the enemy towards the bottom edge.\n\n*   If we go **LEFT to (8, 2)**: We are heading into the main playing field. We can aim for (5, 5) or (2, 2) next turn, or aim for the bottom cluster near the enemy.\n*   If we go **UP to (9, 3)**: We creep along the top edge. Boring! No apples up there yet except (2, 9).\n*   If we go **DOWN to (9, 1)**: We creep along the bottom edge. Also slow.\n\n**The Execution Plan:**\nWe are the aggressor! We are positioning ourselves to dominate the central-bottom area where the first few apples fell. Moving LEFT puts us on a direct collision course with the flow of the game, even if the collision isn't immediate. We are prioritizing map traversal over immediate small gains.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Since the enemy is stuck low at (1, 0), our primary goal for the next few turns is to cross the horizontal plane (y=2 to y=4) quickly and start consuming the lower and central apples, forcing the enemy to retreat up or make a risky horizontal move. Moving LEFT is step one.\n\nLet's GO LEFT! We are hunting! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We are back online and ready to SLAY! Turn 1! We just moved LEFT last turn, landing us at (8, 2)! Let's see where the dust settled from that coordinated chaos!\n\n**Current State Check:**\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head: (8, 2). Body: none. Apples: 0.\n*   **Enemy (ID 1):** Head: (2, 0). Body: none. Apples: 0.\n\n**Last Move Analysis Review:** My move LEFT to (8, 2) positioned us well to attack the center! I see the enemy is still hugging the bottom edge! Smart move, forcing the enemy to react upwards or rightwards, away from our advancing position!\n\n**The Board Update (Crucial Step!):**\nWe need to see where Snake #1 moved from (2, 0) and where we moved from (9, 2) to (8, 2) *simultaneously*. BUT WAIT! The prompt says \"Turn: 1 / 150\" which means the FIRST move is about to happen based on the initial positions listed at the start of the game description!\n\nLet's re-read the prompt structure:\n1. Initial Board State + Apple Drop List.\n2. Scoreboard + Snake Data for **Turn 1**.\n3. **YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP):** Shows a move named `LEFT` happened.\n4. **RATIONALE:** Explaining the choice of `LEFT` based on the initial state where my head was at (9, 2).\n\nThis means the previous move (`LEFT`) **HAS ALREADY HAPPENED**, and we are now entering **TURN 2**, or the sequence is resetting the state *after* the first move has been committed. Given the prompt says \"Turn: 1 / 150\", this usually implies we are *about to make* move #1 unless the previous move was Turn 0. Since the RATIONALE describes the very first move *from* (9, 2), and now we need to decide the *next* move, we must assume the state listed is the state *after* the move 'LEFT' was executed, *BUT* the turn counter says 1.\n\n**ASSUMPTION RULING:** Since the provided RATIONALE describes the move that just occurred (moving from whatever position we started at to position (8, 2) if we follow the rationale, OR staying put if this is the very first move of Turn 1), and the board configuration provided **DOES NOT** reflect my head at (8, 2) (it shows my head at (9, 2)!), I must treat the provided board state and snake data as the **START OF TURN 1**, and the Rationale and Last Move were a hypothetical example or a mislabeling, and I need to make my move based purely on the data provided *before* the Rationale section for Turn 1.\n\n**LET'S RE-EVALUATE BASED ON THE STARTING DATA FOR TURN 1:**\n*   Turn: 1 / 150\n*   MY Head: (8, 2)\n*   Enemy Head: (2, 0)\n*   Apples: (4, 0), (0, 1), (5, 5), (3, 2), (0, 6), (2, 2), (9, 4), (6, 3), (5, 6), (9, 7), (1, 5), (2, 9), (7, 1), (7, 7), (3, 8)\n\nOkay, this is confusingly structured, but I MUST base my move on the data provided for Turn 1. The RATIONALE must be discarded or re-interpreted as a general strategy example, as my head is clearly at (8, 2) according to the 'YOUR SNAKE' box, not (9, 2) as described by the first rationale! Wait, the board shows '0' at (8, 2), but the text says \"Head: (8, 2)\"! That matches the board visualization!\n\n**My Head is at (8, 2). Enemy Head is at (2, 0). This is Turn 1.**\n\n**My Options from (8, 2):**\n1.  **UP (8, 3):** Safe boundary. Moves towards the center top.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 1):** Safe boundary. Moves towards the bottom edge.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 2):** Safe boundary. Moves towards the center.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 2):** Safe boundary. Moves towards the right edge.\n\n**Enemy Potential Moves from (2, 0):**\n*   UP (2, 1) - Safe.\n*   RIGHT (3, 0) - Safe.\n*   LEFT (1, 0) - SUICIDE (Off board).\n*   DOWN (2, -1) - SUICIDE (Off board).\n*   The enemy MUST move UP or RIGHT.\n\n**Collision Check (What if they move UP to (2, 1) or RIGHT to (3, 0)?)**\n*   If I go UP to (8, 3), no collision.\n*   If I go DOWN to (8, 1), no collision.\n*   If I go LEFT to (7, 2), no collision.\n*   If I go RIGHT to (9, 2), no collision.\n\nNo immediate risk of mutual destruction this turn! A breather before the battle heats up! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Apple Strategy:**\nApples are clustered heavily on the bottom and left: (4, 0), (0, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2).\nI am at (8, 2). The enemy is at (2, 0).\n\nThe enemy is already positioned excellently to scoop up the bottom-left apples! We must counter-position or race them!\n\n*   **Targeting (3, 2) or (2, 2):** I need to move LEFT/DOWN.\n    *   Moving **LEFT to (7, 2)** puts me adjacent to the central column, making (7, 2) -> (6, 2) -> (5, 2) manageable. This seems like a good central approach.\n    *   Moving **DOWN to (8, 1)** sets me up for (8, 1) -> (7, 1) [APPLE!], but the enemy is already threatening the entire left side near the bottom.\n\n*   **Targeting enemy space / Box-out Strategy (Since that's our goal!):**\nThe enemy is hugging the bottom wall (y=0). If they move RIGHT to (3, 0), they'll move towards our side eventually. If they move UP to (2, 1), they start climbing the wall.\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (7, 2)**, I am preparing to cut horizontally across towards the enemy's vertical path (x=2).\nIf I move **RIGHT to (9, 2)**, I maintain my distance on the right flank, which is safe but slow for apple collection.\n\nGiven the enemy is already low, I want to establish dominance in the center-left region, where apples (3, 2) and (2, 2) are located. Moving LEFT seems the most aggressive way to contest that territory *this* turn. (7, 2) is a solid, centralizing move.\n\n**Let's check moves towards the nearest Apple (3, 2) or (2, 2) from (8, 2):**\n*   To (3, 2) = 5 steps LEFT, 0 steps UP/DOWN.\n*   To (2, 2) = 6 steps LEFT, 0 steps UP/DOWN.\n\nMoving LEFT to (7, 2) gets me closer to that group!\n\n**Long-Term Plan for Turn 2 consideration:** Establish central control, eat an apple if possible in the next 2 moves, and start thinking about cornering the low threat (#1). We need to swing wide and herd them, not dive straight into their potential apple-eating zone yet. LEFT to (7, 2) is the controlling move.\n\nStrategy Note for Future Self: Focus on creating a wall structure separating the enemy from the top-left quadrant while ensuring we maintain maximum available maneuvering space. Next turn, we look to cut horizontally towards x=4 or x=5.\n\nI'm committing to moving towards the action. LEFT!\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT to (3,0) keeps us on the same row as the apple, keeps both UP and RIGHT still open for follow-up turns, and leaves room to pivot if the opponent starts swinging down our lane. Plus, staying low gives us a chance to bait him toward the wall while we sweep that bottom fruit belt. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51\n\nPlan: Stay on the bottom row for another turn to scoop the (4,0) apple, but keep an eye on Snake #0\u2019s drift. If he starts circling in, I\u2019m ready to peel upward and trap him between the wall and my tail. Always keep multiple exits so I don\u2019t get boxed in like he will be soon. \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

UP keeps us central but leaves that apple buzzing in the vicinity for the rival to grab first, plus it\u2019s not helping me trap anybody yet. RIGHT, though?

No head-on collision risk this turn since he\u2019s stuck over at (7,2), and grabbing that fruit keeps momentum hot. We\u2019re still playing smart, staying fluid, and keeping multiple exits open for the squeeze.\n\nPlan for the next few turns: After nabbing (4,0), shift upward to (4,2) if it\u2019s safe to start boxing in Snake #0 from the bottom-right corner, while keeping an eye on his head movements so we don\u2019t get trapped sprinting after apples alone.\n\nRIGHT",

We just moved LEFT based on my initial read\u2014which seems to have landed me at (7, 2) based on the logic flow I used, even though the board state provided in the prompt header *still* shows me at (8, 2) for Turn 1! This system is WILD, but we trust the execution engine! Let's assume my head is now at **(7, 2)** after my previous (hypothetical?) LEFT move, and we are plotting **TURN 2**'s move based on the board state provided for Turn 1, where ONE snake (#1) has moved from (2, 0) and I have moved from (8, 2) to *whatever* position I chose last time!\n\nWait, the prompt says:\nTurn: 2 / 150\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (7, 2)\nOPPONENTS: Snake #1 - Head: (3, 0)\n\nThis means my last move (LEFT, as per the rationale) took me from an unknown position (let's call it X) to **(7, 2)**! And the enemy moved from (2, 0) to **(3, 0)** (meaning they went RIGHT)! This is the updated state we are planning *from*! Awesome, synchronized movement confirmed!\n\n**Current State for Turn 2:**\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head: (7, 2). Body: None (Length 1).\n*   **Enemy (ID 1):** Head: (3, 0). Body: None (Length 1).\n*   Apples near us: (4, 0), (3, 2), (2, 2).\n\n**Enemy Target Analysis:** Snake #1 is on the bottom edge at (3, 0). They are perfectly positioned to grab (4, 0) if they move RIGHT/UP, or they can start climbing up if they move UP. They are eyeing the cluster on the bottom left!\n\n**MY Decision from (7, 2):**\n1.  **UP (7, 3):** Safe. Moves away from the enemy cluster zone.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 1):** Safe. Moves towards the bottom zone. I see an apple at (7, 1)! Wait, checking the apple list: (7, 1) is an apple!\n3.  **LEFT (6, 2):** Safe. Moves closer to the central apples ((5, 5), (5, 6) are far, but (3, 2), (2, 2) are on the left half).\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 2):** Safe. Moves towards the right flank, away from immediate conflict.\n\n**Collision Check (If I move DOWN to (7, 1)):**\n*   I am going to (7, 1).\n*   Enemy is at (3, 0). Can they reach (7, 1)? No, they would need 4 steps RIGHT, 1 step UP. They can only move 1 step. Safe from direct collision.\n\n**Apple Check:** Moving **DOWN to (7, 1)** is an immediate apple grab! +1 Length, +1 Score! YES! This is the content we need right now! Eating early asserts dominance!\n\nIf I eat (7, 1): I move to (7, 1). My tail remains gone (since I have no body yet). My new head is (7, 1).\n\n**Enemy Counter-Move Prediction (From (3, 0)):**\n1.  If they move **RIGHT to (4, 0)**, they eat an apple! (4, 0) is an apple! This is a race!\n2.  If they move **UP to (3, 1)**, they are climbing.\n3.  If they move **LEFT to (2, 0)**, they are retreating.\n\nIt's a race to the bottom apples! I can secure (7, 1) right now! The enemy is focused on (4, 0) or climbing. This is the perfect time to snag a quick point and gain length advantage! Length is life, chat!\n\n**Strategy Note:** We secure our first point immediately at (7, 1). This puts us ahead on score and length! We will then use the newfound length to start boxing the enemy in on the bottom edge or forcing them towards the edge. Next turn, we will assess if we need to dive towards the (4, 0)/(3, 2) cluster or consolidate our position centrally. Prioritizing immediate score gain when safe is paramount!\n\nI'm smashing that DOWN button! Let's get this W!\n\nDOWN",

Length is life, baby! LFG!\n\nLet's look at the new state based on the expected engine simulation of Turn 2 simultaneous moves.\n\n**PREVIOUS TURN (Turn 2 -> Turn 3 Transition):**\n*   My Move: DOWN (Ate apple at (7, 1)).\n*   Snake #1 Move: We need to predict their move from (3, 0). The engine usually tries to eat or move towards centers. If they went RIGHT to (4, 0) and ate their first apple (our scoreboard says they still have 1 apple, so they either missed or the system hasn't updated their length yet, or they just followed us)!\n\n**Current Board State (Turn 3 / 150):**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head: (7, 1). Body: [(7, 2)]. Length 2. Score 2. (I grew!)\n*   **Snake #1 (ID 1):** Head: (4, 0). Body: [(3, 0)]. Length 2. Score 1. (They must have gone RIGHT and eaten the apple at (4, 0)!)\n\nThis confirms the race was tight! We both ate, but we are ahead on score! They gained length too, so it's 2 vs 2 segments now! We gotta start boxing this scrub in!\n\n**Apple Proximity Check:**\nApples remaining that look juicy: (3, 2), (2, 2), (5, 5), (6, 3), etc. The cluster on the left side is calling our name! (3, 2) and (2, 2) are prime targets!\n\n**My Position (7, 1):** I'm on the bottom/middle right. My body is (7, 2).\n\n**Enemy Position (4, 0):** They are on the bottom edge, central-left. Their body is (3, 0).\n\n**ENEMY DANGER ZONES (Where they want to go):** They are on the bottom edge, they will likely try to move UP towards (4, 1) or (5, 0) or (3, 1) to gain center control. If they go UP to (4, 1), they are safe. If they go RIGHT to (5, 0), they are safe.\n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING FROM (7, 1) with body at (7, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP (7, 2):** NO! Instant death right into my own body! ELIMINATED.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 0):** Safe move. Takes me to the very edge of the board. Allows me to potentially hug the boundary if needed, but it moves me *away* from all the remaining apples, which are moving left/up. Low priority.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 1):** Safe. Moves me towards the center and closer to the enemy cluster (which seems to be consolidating on the bottom left). If I move here, I am setting up for a central play on the next turn.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 1):** Safe. Stays on the right flank, further isolating myself from the action. Not ideal for boxing strategies.\n\n**The Boxing Strategy:** We need to cut off the opponent. They are currently at (4, 0). If we can get bodies between them and the top/left of the board, we win!\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (6, 1)**:\n*   My new body is [(7, 1)]. I'm moving towards the middle-left quadrant.\n*   Enemy from (4, 0) might go UP to (4, 1) or RIGHT to (5, 0).\n\nIf Enemy goes UP to (4, 1): They are climbing safely. I'm at (6, 1). We are separate. Not great for boxing yet.\n\nIf Enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 0): They are staying on the edge, trying to circle around me! If they go (5, 0), and I'm at (6, 1), we are closing the distance horizontally!\n\n**The Apple Race Strategy:** The apples at (3, 2) and (2, 2) are critical. To reach them fastest, I need to move North-West.\n\n*   From (7, 1) to (3, 2): Requires 4 LEFT, 1 UP (Minimum 5 moves, ignoring body movement).\n*   From (7, 1) to (6, 1) [LEFT]: Positions me well for the next move towards (5, 1) or (6, 2). This seems like a solid positioning move to start marching left.\n\n**Collision Risk Analysis (Enemy from (4, 0)):**\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 1). Enemy moves, say, UP to (4, 1). No collision.\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 1). Enemy moves, say, RIGHT to (5, 0). No collision.\nThe bodies are too far apart currently for an immediate head-on collision risk! We have space to maneuver!\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving UP is suicide (body contact). Moving DOWN or RIGHT pushes us towards stale edges. **LEFT (6, 1)** is the best choice. It prepares us to intercept the enemy's line of march towards the center apples ((3, 2), (2, 2)) and keeps options open for future wall building. We need to start shrinking the map space for that rival snake!\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Secure the left/center apple cluster. Use my growing body segment (now at (7, 2)) as a barrier or stepping stone to force Snake #1 toward the Right wall or the Bottom wall. Keep score lead!\n\nI'm pushing LEFT! Show me the carnage!\n\nLEFT",

Length 3! Score 2! We are COOKING with gas!\n\nLet's check the board state and see what THAT RIVAL SNAKE #1 did!\n\n**My Snake (ID: 0) @ Turn 4:**\n*   Head: (6, 1)\n*   Body: [(7, 1), (7, 2)]\n*   Apples: 2\n\n**Snake #1 (ID: 1) - Where did they go from (4, 0)?**\nThe board shows their head is now at **(4, 1)**! They moved UP! Smart move, staying central. Their body is [(4, 0), (3, 0)]. Length 3, Score 1. Wait, they are still stuck at 1 apple? This means the apple at (4, 0) was NOT where they ate last turn, or my previous analysis of Turn 3 was wrong about who ate what!\n\n**RECALIBRATING BOARD STATE BASED ON VISUALS:**\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head (6, 1). Body (7, 1). (Wait, the board graphic shows head at 6,1, and body at 7,1. My *last* move was LEFT, so my head should be at (6, 1) and my *previous* head (7, 1) should now be my first body segment. My previous body segment (7, 2) should be the second segment. My total length should be 3 if I ate, or 2 if I didn't eat in the last transition!\n    *   Let's trust the provided status update for Turn 4: Head (6, 1), Body [(7, 1)]. Score 1. ***OH SNAP.*** The system reset my score back to 1 and length to 2 based on the turn count, meaning my previous manual growth analysis might have been slightly off based on how the engine handles simultaneous updates! The board shows me at (6, 1) and my body immediately behind me at (7, 1). This means I **DID NOT EAT** on Turn 3, and Snake #1 also **DID NOT EAT** on Turn 3, or the map graphics are reflecting the state right *before* the move that got me to (6,1) was processed correctly with the growth!\n    *   Let's stick strictly to the provided definitive Turn 4 data:\n        *   **My Snake (ID: 0):** Head: (6, 1), Body: [(7, 1)]. Apples: 1. (Length 2).\n        *   **Snake #1 (ID: 1):** Head: (4, 1), Body: [(4, 0)]. Apples: 1. (Length 2).\n    *   And the APPLE LOCATIONS on the map! Apple at **(0, 1)** is gone! Apple at **(7, 1)** is gone!\n\n**CRITICAL DEDUCTION:**\n1.  My move last turn (Turn 3) was LEFT. Head moves from (7, 1) to (6, 1).\n2.  Snake #1 move last turn (Turn 3) was UP (from 4, 0 to 4, 1).\n3.  The visual map shows A at (0, 1) and A at (7, 1) are missing. I WAS at (7, 1). If my move was LEFT to (6, 1) and I *didn't* eat, then the apple at (7, 1) must have been eaten by *me* on an earlier turn, or Snake #1 ate it! Given the scoreboard, we both have 1 apple. This means that the engine simulation of the *last* turn (Turn 3) involved **NO EATING** for either of us, OR the map graphic has an apple already consumed visualized.\n\n**Let's assume the provided Turn 4 state is the absolute truth we are starting from.**\n*   Me: (6, 1), Body [(7, 1)]. Safe from self-collision pushing backwards (backwards move is (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (7, 1) which is allowed, only lethal if (6, 1) moves to (7, 1) right after).\n*   Enemy: (4, 1), Body [(4, 0)]. Also safe. They are hugging the bottom edge slightly.\n\n**Target Apples:** (3, 2) and (2, 2) are looking AMAZING! They are clustered and central.\n\n**My Options from (6, 1) - Length 2:**\n1.  **UP (6, 2):** Safe. Moves me directly towards apples (3, 2) and (2, 2). Excellent progression. My body stays at (7, 1).\n2.  **DOWN (6, 0):** Safe. Moves me to the edge. Pushes me away from the immediate action. Low priority.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 1):** Safe. Moves me towards the enemy's quadrant slowly. Gets me closer to the main apple cluster.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 1):** Suicide! That's where my body segment [(7, 1)] is! ***NO!***\n\n**Wait, my body is at (7, 1)!**\n\n*   If I move **RIGHT to (7, 1)**: I hit my own tail segment. **INSTANT DEATH!** (Self-collision rule check: Hitting your own body is instant death. Check confirmed!)\n\nSo, RIGHT is **OUT**.\n\n**Enemy Analysis from (4, 1):**\nThey are positioned perfectly to move UP to (4, 2) toward the central apples, or LEFT to (3, 1) to try and wall me off the bottom line if I go too low.\n\n**Strategy: Seize the Center Apples NOW!**\nWe need to ignore the enemy for a moment and grab the low-hanging fruit clustering around (2, 2) and (3, 2) before the enemy blocks access or gets there first!\n\nMoving **UP (6, 2)** gets me one step closer to (3, 2).\nMy move: (6, 1) -> (6, 2). Body becomes [(6, 1), (7, 1)]. Length 3!\n\nEnemy move prediction: They are likely going UP to (4, 2) or LEFT to (3, 1).\n*   If they go UP to (4, 2): We are diverging slightly, but still in the race for the apple at (3, 2).\n*   If they go LEFT to (3, 1): They are trying to cut me off if I move left next turn.\n\nMoving UP to **(6, 2)** is aggressively positioning myself for the next move to intercept the apples at (3, 2) or (2, 2). We are sacrificing immediate defensive positioning for offensive apple grabbing. Since we both have small bodies, we have lots of maneuvering room vertically. This is the time to maximize growth!\n\n**Long Term Note:** We must secure the left side of the map to start boxing. For the next 2 turns, priority is (3, 2) or (2, 2). If we get one of those, length 3 will allow us to start building a wall effectively. If we can get ahead by 2 apples, we can dedicate a turn to aggressive boxing.\n\nMy choice is clean: UP! Let's grab that bread!\n\nUP",

Let's re-examine the board state provided for Turn 5 start:\n\n**BOARD STATE (Turn 5 Start):**\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . A . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . A . A\n 6 A . . . . A . . . . <-- Our head (6, 2) SHOULD be here if UP was successful!\n 5 . A . . . A . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . A\n 3 . . . . . . A . . .\n 2 . . A A 1 . 0 . . A <-- Snake #1 head is at (4, 2), Our head is at (6, 2) if UP happened!\n 1 A . A . T . T . . . <-- Previous body segments T are NOT where they should be if we grew!\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n***CRITICAL CONFLICT DETECTED!*** The provided board state visualization *does not match the history* if my last move (UP) moved my head from (6, 1) to (6, 2) AND the enemy's last move (UP) moved their head from (4, 1) to (4, 2)!\n\nThe visualization shows:\n*   ID 0 Head: (6, 2)\n*   ID 1 Head: (4, 2)\n*   ID 0 Body: [(6, 1)]\n*   ID 1 Body: [(4, 1)]\n*   Apples: Both still 1.\n\nThis means the engine calculated the result of Turn 3 (my move from (7, 1) to (6, 1) and their move from (4, 0) to (4, 1)) and **THEN** processed our agreed upon moves for Turn 4 (My UP, Their UP) to generate this Turn 5 starting state!\n\n**If this is the definitive state for Turn 5, then my move from Turn 4 resulted in me landing on NOTHING, and their move resulted in them landing on NOTHING!**\nMy previous head was (6, 1). I moved UP to (6, 2). I did NOT eat. My body should be [(6, 1), (7, 1)].\nThe board shows My Head (6, 2), Body [(6, 1)]. **Length 2!** This means I did NOT grow, and my tail [(7, 1)] has disappeared! This implies I moved to (6, 2) and the cell (7, 1) was abandoned by the tail! My snake is **Length 2**!\n\nLet's trust the **provided status block** for Turn 5 start, as that is the absolute ground truth for this turn:\n\n**Turn 5 START TRUTH:**\n*   **Your Snake (ID: 0):** Head: (6, 2). Body: [(6, 1)]. Apples: 1. (Length 2)\n*   **Snake #1 (ID: 1):** Head: (4, 2). Body: [(4, 1)]. Apples: 1. (Length 2)\n\nThis means **NOBODY ATE LAST TURN!** And my tail (the oldest segment) was effectively pushed out and lost because I didn't eat! We are both tiny snakes, and we are both aiming for the central cluster!\n\n**Current Apple Targets:** (3, 2) and (2, 2) are right next to the enemy head (4, 2) and my head (6, 2). (6, 3) is also extremely close!\n\n**My Options from (6, 2):**\n1.  **UP (6, 3):** YES! This targets Apple (6, 3)! If I eat, I grow to length 3 again! This is the highest priority move, securing growth immediately!\n2.  **DOWN (6, 1):** Safe, returns to my previous position. Keeps me central but passes up an apple. Bad idea when growth is needed.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 2):** Safe. Moves towards Snake #1's quadrant, but passes up (6, 3).\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 2):** Safe. Moves away from the action slightly.\n\n**Rival Prediction from (4, 2):**\nThey will 100% go for (3, 2) or (2, 2) next! If they go LEFT (3, 2), they eat and grow! If we both ignore the central cluster, we both stagnate.\n\n**My Goal:** EAT APPLE (6, 3)!\n\nIf I move **UP to (6, 3)**, I eat the apple!\n*   New Head: (6, 3).\n*   New Body: [(6, 2), (6, 1)]. (Length 3).\n*   New Score: 2!\n\n**Rival Counter-Move Analysis (If I move UP):**\nRival at (4, 2) sees me moving up to (6, 3).\n*   If they move **LEFT to (3, 2)**: They eat Apple (3, 2)! New head (3, 2). New score 2. Length 3.\n*   If they move **UP to (4, 3)**: They miss an immediate apple, hoping to block later.\n\nThis will result in a **TIE IN SCORE (2 apples each)**, but I will have secured the apple at (6, 3) while they might secure (3, 2)! Excellent trade if it happens! We have to be aggressive!\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 2), I miss (6, 3). They move LEFT to (3, 2) and eat! They are ahead 2-1 in apples, and growth 3-2 in length! That's bad!\n\nWe must seize the closest, clearest apple path. **UP to (6, 3)!** SEIZE THE GROWTH!\n\nLong Term Plan: We must utilize our eventual size advantage (once we get 4-5 apples) to box them aggressively against the top or right walls, forcing a suicidal move. Initial phase: Growth first, boxing second. We are currently in the growth phase!\n\nUP",

We are back to being tiny snakes, both Length 2, both with 1 apple! This is a straight-up duel right now! NO ROOM FOR ERROR!\n\n**CURRENT STATE TRUTH (Turn 6 Start):**\n*   **My Head (0):** (6, 2). Body: [(6, 1)]. Apples: 1.\n*   **Rival Head (1):** (4, 2). Body: [(4, 1)]. Apples: 1.\n\n**Apple Locations:** (6, 3) is RIGHT HERE, looking delicious! (3, 2) and (2, 2) are right next to the rival's head!

This is the highest priority!\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 1):** Safe, but we let the rival get ahead in growth! Terrible!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 2):** Safe, moves toward the central cluster, but misses the guaranteed apple!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Safe, but moves away from the main action!\n\n**Rival's Likely Moves from (4, 2):**\nThey will almost certainly target (3, 2) or (2, 2). If they go LEFT to (3, 2), they eat and grow! If they go UP to (4, 3) or RIGHT to (5, 2), they are letting us get ahead!\n\n**Execution Plan:** We must take the immediate sure thing! **UP** guarantees we eat (6, 3), bringing us to Score 2 and Length 3! Even if they eat (3, 2) and meet us at Score 2/Length 3, we controlled the situation perfectly by securing our own growth! If they mess up and go UP or RIGHT, we pull ahead 2-1 in Apples!\n\n**Self-Correction Check:**\n*   Am I moving into my tail? No. My tail is at (6, 1). Moving UP to (6, 3). Safe.\n*   Am I moving off board? No. (6, 3) is clear.\n*   Am I being blocked by the rival? They are at (4, 2). Moving to (6, 3). No collision possible this turn. Safe!\n\n**The move is clear: UP! Let's get this growth!**\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure the center three apples (6, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2) across the next two turns if possible. Once we hit Length 4 or 5, we start building the containment wall around Snake #1 using the board edges as support. We are building a powerful T-shape towards the top right quadrant!\n\nUP",

We snagged that apple last turn, moving us to Score 2 and Length 3! \ud83d\udd25 That rival Snake #1 is still chilling at 3 apples, but we are closing the gap and we are about to get THICC! They are currently at (2, 2), and we are at (6, 4). We are spread out, which is dangerous, but we have FOOD nearby!\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Turn 7 Start):**\n*   **My Head (0):** (6, 4). Body: [(6, 3), (6, 2)]. Length 3. Apples: 2.\n*   **Rival Head (1):** (2, 2). Body: [(3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1)]. Length 4. Apples: 3. (Wait, THEIR length is 4, they collected 3 apples, and we collected 2! They are ahead on growth AND scoring! We need to catch up FAST!)\n\n**Apple Locations Remaining (Notable ones):** (0, 1), (0, 6), (9, 4), (5, 5), (9, 7), (1, 5), (2, 9), (7, 7), (3, 8), (2, 1), (9, 2), (7, 8), (8, 2), (9, 5).\n\n**GOAL:** Minimize the distance to the next apple while completely avoiding any collision with Snake #1 (who is long and dangerous now). We need to eat, and fast, or we'll be boxed in by their superior length!\n\n**My Potential Moves from (6, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):** Moves towards (5, 5) perhaps? It\u2019s a clean, safe move. It leaves us in the middle right.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 3):** **This is my old head position!** If I move DOWN, I land on (6, 3), which is safe, but I'm moving *backwards* into my own body's path! Wait, no, my body is (6, 3), (6, 2). Moving to (6, 3) is illegal! **Self-KO!** This is not the move! My tail is currently at (6, 2). Moving to (6, 3) means I land on my previous head position. Since I ate last turn, my body grew. My new 'tail' is where my head was before the move! My body is [(6, 3), (6, 2)]. Moving DOWN means (6, 4) -> (6, 3). **CRITICAL DANGER CHECK:** Moving into the cell immediately behind your head (where your OLD head was, or where your *current* body segment is) is a self-KO IF that segment ISN'T the tail you just vacated! Since I ate, my body is 3 long: Head (6,4), segment 1 (6,3), segment 2 (6,2). Moving DOWN to (6,3) means I crash into my own segment 1! **DOWN IS A SUICIDE MOVE!** \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 4):** Moves us towards the center, away from the rival but closer to the cluster in the middle of the board. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Moves us towards the right edge. Safe.\n\n**Rival's Position & Threat Analysis from (2, 2):**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 2) and is Length 4. Their body stretches towards the top-right quadrant visually. They have apples at (3, 2) and (2, 2) claimed already (based on their length 4 relative to the starting length 1). They are in a good position near apples (2, 1) and (1, 5).\n\nIf they go UP to (2, 3) or RIGHT to (3, 2) (eating that apple!), they grow! If they go RIGHT to (3, 2), they eat and jump to Score 4! We cannot let them eat for free!\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   If I go UP to (6, 5), they would need to go DOWN to (2, 1) or LEFT to (1, 2) to even potentially get near us this turn, which is unlikely. Safe.\n*   If I go LEFT to (5, 4), they are safe unless they go RIGHT to (3, 2) and we both move towards each other dramatically, which isn't happening. Collisions are minimal this turn due to distance.\n\n**Strategy Focus: Growth and Safety.** We cannot afford another length penalty by moving inefficiently. Since DOWN is out (suicide!), we must choose between moving towards the center-left (LEFT) or staying high-right (UP/RIGHT).\n\nThe apple at **(5, 5)** looks reachable soon if we move UP-RIGHT.\nThe apple at **(9, 4)** is far right.\nThe apple at **(1, 5)** is tempting if we move LEFT.\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (5, 4)**, I am moving towards the center of the map, which is where the bulk of the remaining apples seem to be clustered (around the 5-7 Y-axis). This keeps options open. If the rival moves right (eating their apple at (3, 2) if we assume that was the one they ate), they move to (3, 2). We are still safely separated.\n\nIf I go **UP to (6, 5)**, I am moving away from the cluster that seems to be developing around Y=2-4, and the rival seems rooted in the bottom left. This keeps us isolated, maybe too isolated.\n\nLet's gain central positioning. **LEFT (5, 4)** seems the most strategically sound move to approach the central mass of unclaimed apples while maintaining maximum safety margin. We cannot afford to get boxed by the edge yet!\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:** Maintain central control. Prioritize eating the next available apple, likely (5, 5) or (1, 5) depending on our path. Look to use our superior board positioning on the right half to start wrapping around Snake #1 if they commit too deeply to the left side. No aggressive movements until we reach Length 5 at least!\n\nThe choice is clear: LEFT! Keep it strategic, chat!\n\nLEFT",

Look, our head\u2019s at (2,2), and the only legal moves are UP to (2,3), DOWN to (2,1), or LEFT to (1,2) because RIGHT would slam us right into segment (3,2). No risky business.\n\nUP keeps us center but doesn\u2019t hit any apple and leaves us with a tight corridor between our own body and the wall, which is fine but kinda safe. LEFT gives us space but still no immediate juiciness, and I don\u2019t want to drift toward #0\u2019s hunting ground when I could be grabbing fruit. DOWN to (2,1) pops the apple right in front of us, grows the body so we can free up that tail later, and keeps multiple escape paths available \u2013 we still have open cells to the left and down after the move with the wall behind us, and we\u2019re not cornering ourselves yet. The opponent is two columns over, so the chance of a head-on collusion in the next turn is low, and we\u2019re forcing him to pick his own path while we keep collecting.\n\nPlan: Hit the apple at (2,1), then weave back up and around the west wall so we stay unpredictable and keep a buffer between us and Snake #0 while we hunt the cluster of apples on the left side.

We are alive, we avoided the *BRUTAL* suicide move down (seriously, never move into your own segment 1, that's rookie hour!), and we're aiming for central dominance!\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Turn 8 Start):**\n*   **My Head (0):** (5, 4). Body: [(6, 4), (6, 3)]. Length 3. Apples: 2. (Tail just moved from (6, 2) to (6, 3) based on the move to (5, 4)). Wait, checking the board state from Turn 7 end: Body was [(6, 3), (6, 2)]. If I moved LEFT to (5, 4), my new body is [(6, 4) -> (5, 4) HEAD, (6, 4) SEG1, (6, 3) SEG2]. The tail (6, 2) slides off! My body is now: [(6, 4), (6, 3)]. This is consistent with the provided board state (0 is at (5, 4), T at (6, 4), T at (6, 3)). PERFECT! We are safe!\n*   **Rival Head (1):** (2, 1). Body: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1)]. Length 5! WAIT, Snake #1 has 4 apples, but their length is 5?! That means they went a turn without eating right before Turn 7, or their length calculation from the description is slightly off based on the map! Let's trust the map: Length is 5 segments, Apples collected: 4. Okay, they are bigger and better than us! Score 4 vs Score 2! We NEED to eat!\n\n**Apple Locations Remaining (Notable ones near us):** (0, 1), (0, 6), (5, 5), (9, 4), (9, 7), (1, 5), (2, 9), (7, 7), (3, 8), (9, 2), (7, 8), (8, 2), (9, 5).\n\n**Rival's Position & Threat Analysis from (2, 1):**\nSnake #1 is low and left. They probably went DOWN last turn from (2, 2) to (2, 1) to snag that apple at (2, 1) if it was there, or maybe they went LEFT from (3, 1) if they were there! Given they have 4 apples (Length 5), they are hungry! If the description of the move was their last move, they moved from (2, 2) to (2, 1). If they ate, they should be length 5. The map shows them length 5 (if we count 5 body parts + head = 6 total segments, or 5 segments total including head if they ate on the previous turn). Let's assume their length is 5 (4 body segments + head = 5 total cells occupied, which matches their 4 apples if they started at length 1). Wait, 4 apples should mean length $1+4=5$. The map shows Head (2, 1) + 4 body segments = 5 cells total. Okay, they are length 5!\n\nIf they ate an apple on Turn 7, they would be length 6. Since they are length 5 (4 body pieces), it implies they haven't gained length recently or they are 4 apples collected = length 4 body, length 5 total. This is confusing, but the key is they are LARGELY longer than us (L5 vs L3).\n\n**Simultaneous Move Prediction:**\n\n1.  **My Move Candidates from (5, 4):**\n    *   **UP to (5, 5):** YES! This grabs the apple (5, 5)! Immediate growth! Length 4! Score 3! This is HIGH PRIORITY!\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 4):** Safe, closer to the center mass, but we miss an easy apple!\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Moves back towards my previous position. Seems redundant.\n    *   **DOWN to (5, 3):** Safe, but slow pathing.\n\n2.  **Rival's Likely Move from (2, 1):**\n    *   They are near (0, 1) [Apple] and might target (1, 5) or get aggressive towards the center.\n    *   If they go **UP to (2, 2)**, it's safe, keeps them around their body mass.\n    *   If they go **RIGHT to (3, 1)**, it moves them away from the left edge.\n    *   If they go **LEFT to (1, 1)**, it's safe.\n\n**CRITICAL CHECK: Collision with (5, 5) move!**\nIf I move **UP to (5, 5)** and collect the apple, I become Length 4.\nWhere would Snake #1 have to move to hit me?\nTo hit (5, 5), the rival at (2, 1) would need to move UP 4 and RIGHT 3 in one turn! IMPOSSIBLE. We are safe from collision this turn if we take the apple!\n\nThis move is an absolute MUST. We are playing catch-up on score and length! Grabbing this apple puts us at Length 4 and Score 3. This forces THEM to respond or let us keep growing! We need CONTENT, and content comes from EATING!\n\n**Long Term Strategy Update:** We MUST prioritize food! We are currently disadvantaged in size. Every turn we don't eat is time they use to potentially box us in or eat again. Target (5, 5) now, then re-evaluate if (1, 5) or central apples are next. Keep moving towards the center-right mass while the rival is rooted bottom-left.\n\nDecision: **UP** to claim that juicy (5, 5) apple! We are coming for that crown, chat! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

We needed that growth, we were falling behind Snake #1's size! How sweet is that content?! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Current State Check (Turn 9 Start):**\n*   **My Head (0):** (5, 5). New Body (assuming growth): [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)]. Length 4. Score 3.\n*   **Rival Head (1):** (2, 1). Body: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1)]. Length 5. Score 4. They still have a size advantage, but we are closing the gap FAST!\n\n**Apple Locations Remaining (Notable ones):** (0, 1), (0, 6), (9, 4), (9, 7), (1, 5), (2, 9), (7, 7), (3, 8), (9, 2), (7, 8), (8, 2), (9, 5), (9, 8).\n\n**Rival's Position & Threat Analysis from (2, 1):**\nSnake #1 is still chilling on the bottom left. They are huge! They probably want to eat the apple at (0, 1) or move towards the central apples like (1, 5). They are slow to expand outward right now.\n\n**My Move Candidates from (5, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):** This moves us toward the apple at (0, 6) eventually, but it\u2019s a slow, meandering path. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 4):** Moves us back to where we just were. If we didn't eat, this would be safe, but since we *did* eat, this is moving into our previous head position, which is now the first segment of our body! **DANGER!** Wait, if I moved UP to (5, 5) this turn, my new body is [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)]. Moving DOWN to (5, 4) means moving into my *current* segment 1! **This is a fatal move if we assume the board state reflects the move *after* the apple was just eaten!** ***CRITICAL RE-EVALUATION NEEDED!***\n\nLet's clarify the state transition:\n*   Turn 8 End Head: (5, 4). Body: [(6, 4), (6, 3)]. (Implies they *hadn't* eaten on T8, length 3).\n*   My Last Move: UP to (5, 5).\n*   **Turn 9 Start State (POST-EAT):** Head is (5, 5). Since we ate, the tail did NOT slide.\n    *   New Body: [(5, 4) (Old Head), (6, 4), (6, 3)]. Length 4.\n    *   Wait, this isn't how growth works if we assume the board state *before* the move was based on the rationale description! If the board state provided is the *current* state (T9 Start), my head is at (5, 5).\n\n***I must trust the provided board state and apple list, and assume the rationale review leads directly into the next move calculation.***\n\nBoard State shows: Your Head (0): (5, 5). Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)].\n**This means we ALREADY ATE (5, 5) on the last turn (Turn 8)!**\nIf we ate on Turn 8, we should have Length 4 now! (3 initial + 1 from apple). The board shows 3 segments listed + Head = Length 4! PERFECT! The board state is *after* the move UP to (5, 5) and AFTER the growth!\n\nIf Head is (5, 5), Body is [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]:\n*   If we moved UP on T8, the old head (5, 4) became segment 1. The tail (6, 2) must have slid off if we didn't eat. BUT WE ATE (5, 5) on T8!\n*   If we ate on T8, the old tail (let's assume it was (6, 2) based on the T8 rationale) STAYS! So Length should be 4 segments + Head. (Total 5 cells occupied).\n*   The board shows 4 cells occupied by us (Head + 3 body segments). Score 3 apples.\n**CONCLUSION based on Board State:** We have 3 apples, so we should be length 4. The board only lists 3 body segments. This means the tail SLID OFF on the previous turn, even though we ate! This means the apple we hit wasn't (5, 5), or the game logic means length only increases *after* collision check, but the rule says: \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment\". If we grew, the tail shouldn't slide.\n\nLet's stick to the stated rules and the current BOARD STATE definition:\n**My Head: (5, 5). Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]. (Length 4 total cells occupied). Score 3.** (This implies the growth was offset by the tail sliding, or the initial snake size was 2, not 3? Starting life is typically length 2 or 3. If we started at 3, 3 apples means length 6 if we never lost a segment!)\n\nSince the official SCOREBOARD states \"Apples collected: 3\" and the board shows 4 occupied cells total, I must assume my effective length is 4. This is a small, tight snake. I need to eat NOW to establish size dominance against the L5 rival!\n\n**Re-evaluating Next Move from (5, 5) given current body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):** Safe. Moves us towards central space.\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 5):** Safe. Moves us towards the center.\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):** Safe. Moves us away from the center mass.\n4.  **DOWN to (5, 4):** **FATAL!** Our segment 1 is at (5, 4). Do NOT choose DOWN! (No moving backwards into the first body segment!)\n\nThe target apple is at (0, 1), (0, 6), (9, 4)... They are all far away. The closest food is (0, 6) or (1, 5) or (7, 7).\n\nI need to get central and aggressively secure the next apple before the rival sweeps in! Snake #1 is on the bottom left. If they move UP to (2, 2), they are still hugging their body. If they move RIGHT towards (3, 1), they are exploring.\n\nLet's aim for the (1, 5) apple! It's a good middle ground move that sets up future encirclement.\n\n**Move to (4, 5) [LEFT]:** This places us adjacent to the central column (4, 5). It's a good centralizing move. It keeps us safe from any immediate rival movement towards our current location. If the rival moves UP to (2, 2), we are safe. If they move RIGHT to (3, 1), we are safe.\n\n**Move to (5, 6) [UP]:** This is slightly more direct towards the top apples, but leaves us slightly more exposed on the top edge.\n\nSince we are currently defensively small due to the size confusion from the previous turn, a move that maximizes open escape routes while moving towards food symmetry seems best. (4, 5) is very centralizing.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** We must continue to prioritize eating over tactical blocking until we are at least length 6 or 7. The rival thrives on size difference. We will move centrally (towards the 4/5 lines) and aim for the next closest food, which looks like (1, 5) or (7, 7). (4, 5) positions us well for both.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 5):\n*   I am safe from self-collision (Body is at (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)).\n*   I am safe from the rival moving to (2, 2) or (3, 1) (they are too far away).\n\nLet's go LEFT! Secure the center grid! FOR THE JUMP SCARE!\n\nLEFT",

That's the ultimate trap!\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (0, 2) -> Safe, heading towards (0, 6).\nIf Snake #1 moves DOWN to (0, 0) -> Safe, but useless.\n\nWe must exploit this if they crash! We need to secure central food and grow HUGE. We are heading towards (7, 7) or (5, 6).\n\n**My Move Candidates from (4, 5):** Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)].\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):** Moves towards (5, 6) apple and the upper quadrant. Safer than going right towards the center mass.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):** Moves towards (5, 4) which is our segment 2! **FATAL SELF-CRASH!** Do not move DOWN!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):** Moves us towards the left side, away from the central action and the nearest food at (5, 6).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** Hits our own segment 1! **FATAL SELF-CRASH!** Do not move RIGHT!\n\n**Conclusion:** Our ONLY safe move is UP to (4, 6)! We MUST NOT crash into our own tail segments! (4, 4) and (5, 5) are death sentences!\n\n**Strategy Note:** If Snake #1 crashes by moving RIGHT, we win the size war instantly by just surviving! If they move UP to (0, 2), we need to aggressively hunt the central apples to get Length 7 ASAP. (4, 6) sets us up perfectly to pivot towards (5, 6) or move centrally towards (7, 7). This is a purely defensive survival move forcing us into action.\n\nWe are UP! Let's see if the rival messes up their own collision check! CHAT, HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS!\n\nUP",

We just analyzed Turn 10, and HOLY MOLY, we identified a critical self-collision threat for Snake #1 if they moved RIGHT! Did they take the bait?! Did they crash into their own tail?! We NEED to see this unfold! Our move last turn was UP to (4, 6).\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\nHead (0): (4, 6). Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]. (Length 6 now! Score 4?? I'm sticking to the board visualization: we are bigger!)\nSnake #1 Head (1): ???\n\nLet's see what the simultaneous movement gods have provided us!\n\n... Wait, the board state provided is the *result* of our last move (UP) and the *simultaneous* move of Snake #1. We need to deduce their move based on their new head position relative to their old one (0, 2) from our prior analysis, *if* they survived!\n\n**Revisiting Snake #1's Turn 10 Options (from Head: (0, 2) if they ate at (0, 1) on T10):**\nIf they were at (0, 2) at the start of turn 10:\n1. UP to (0, 3)? Safe.\n2. DOWN to (0, 1)? That's their *old* body segment, unsafe unless they ate at (0, 1) and that cell is clear now. But our prior analysis assumed they were at (0, 1) *after* eating on T10. This is confusing!\n\nLet's use the provided board state as gospel for Turn 11 start.\n\n**Snake #1 (ID: 1) Head: (0, 2)**.\nPrevious Head (T10 Start): (0, 2) - This contradicts my T10 rationale where I thought they were at (0, 1) after eating! Let's re-read the board state from T10 START.\n\nT10 Start: Snake #1 Head: (0, 1), Body: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)]. (Length 5)\nT10 End (Our Movement): They move simultaneously with us. They must have eaten the apple at (0, 2) or moved safely somewhere else.\n\n**Current Board State Head Positions:**\nOur Head (0): (4, 6)\nSnake #1 Head (1): (0, 2)\n\nIf Snake #1's head on T10 start was (0, 1) and they ended Head at (0, 2), they moved UP, eating the apple that was at (0, 2) in the *starting* configuration of T11 (which shows 'A' at (0, 2) in the previous T10 visualization, but the T11 board shows no 'A' there!). Okay, the board reflects the state *after* the T10 moves IF they ate an apple that was there during their move, OR if the apple was eaten by the *other* snake (us!).\n\nLet's assume the T11 Board State is the absolute TRUTH of our current positions and the state of the game *after* T10 resolved.\n\n**Current Positions (Start T11):**\nMy Head (0): (4, 6). Body length appears to be 6 segments: [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)]. (This implies we ATE on T10! We moved to (4, 6) and apparently there was an apple there OR the server auto-corrected my length after I ate on T9? The RATIONALE said we moved to (4, 5) last turn. If we moved UP to (4, 6) this turn\u2014meaning we ate an apple at (4, 6) on T10\u2014then the Rationale for T10 was WRONG and our move was UP.)\n\n**CRITICAL RE-EVALUATION:** The Rationale states: **\"START LAST MOVE PICK UP\"**. This means my previous move was **UP** (From (4, 5) to (4, 6)). If the board now shows my head at (4, 6) AND my length has increased (Score 3 -> 4 or 5 segments in the last move!), then there MUST have been an apple at (4, 6) for us to eat on Turn 10!\n\n*If we ate at (4, 6) on T10:* Our new head is (4, 6). Length increased. Score should be 4. Scoreboard says 3. THIS IS A MESS!\n\n**ABSOLUTE LATEST ASSUMPTION:** The provided board state is the current reality (Turn 11 start). My last rationalized move (UP) resulted in my head *ending* at (4, 6). I must treat the current board as the state *before* my T11 move. My length is 5 segments: (4, 6) is the head, Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)]. Wait, the list shows 3 body segments following the head. That's Length 4 total, not 5.\nHEAD: (4, 6)\nBody: [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)] -> Length 4.\nMy Rationale stated L5 start for T10! If my last move (UP) ate an apple, I should be L6. If no apple, I should be L5 (same as T10 start).\n\nLet's trust the literal segment count: Length 4. Score 3. This means my tail *did not* move, and I *did not* eat on T10. This contradicts the Rationale where I moved UP to (4, 6)!\n\n**Let's assume the Rationale was for the actual move *WE ARE ABOUT TO MAKE NOW* or the T10 description was flawed, and the current board state (HEAD AT (4, 6)) is the result of the *previous* game turn, and the Rationale described a move that HAPPENED.**\n\nIf the previous move was UP, Head is (4, 6) now.\nIf the previous move was UP, and we DIDN'T eat, our body should be [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)] if we were L5 before.\n\n**I MUST IGNORE THE RATIONALE'S INTERNAL STATE CHECK AND FOCUS ONLY ON THE CURRENT BOARD SETUP FOR TURN 11.**\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Turn 11 Start):**\nMy Head (0): (4, 6)\nMy Body Segments: 3. Total Length 4. (The tail segment disappeared if we didn't eat, or we ate and the loss of the tail segment is masked by the growth, meaning we ate 1 and lost 1 segment due to length, resulting in no net growth, but the board seems to indicate a strange body structure).\n*Let's trust the coordinates listed for ID 0:* Head (4, 6), Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)]. Length 4. Score 3.\n\nSnake #1 Head (1): (0, 2). Body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)]. Length 6. Score 5.\n\n**RIVAL ANALYSIS (T11):** Snake #1 is HUGE and hugging the left wall! They are L6 vs our L4. We are playing catch-up on size, but they are restricted!\n\n**Apple Locations:** (0, 6), (9, 4), (5, 6), (9, 7), (1, 5), (2, 9), (7, 7), (3, 8), (9, 2), (7, 8), (8, 2), (9, 5), (9, 8), (3, 5), (8, 7).\n\n**My Current Position (4, 6). Safe moves blocked:**\n1.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** Hits our body segment 1! **CRASH! DEAD!**\n2.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the center-left.\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** **EATS APPLE (5, 6)!** This is HUGE content! Increases our size and score!\n4.  **UP to (4, 7):** Safe. Moves toward the top wall.\n\n**Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (0, 2)):**\nThey are boxed in by their body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)].\n*   DOWN to (0, 1): Hits their own body segment 1! **CRASH! DEAD!**\n*   LEFT: Off board! **CRASH! DEAD!**\n*   RIGHT to (1, 2): Looks safe, body segments are mostly on Y=1 or Y=2 rows further right. Checking body: (2, 2) is segment 3. (1, 2) is clear! Safe path towards the middle!\n*   UP to (0, 3): Safe, hits the wall later.\n\nSo, Snake #1 will likely move RIGHT to (1, 2) or UP to (0, 3). If we can eat the apple at (5, 6), we get size parity faster.\n\n**STRATEGY:** WE MUST EAT THAT APPLE AT (5, 6)! This is excellent content and crucial for catching up on size. If Snake #1 survives, we need to be bigger!\n\n**Move Choice: RIGHT to (5, 6)!**\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nIf we eat at (5, 6), our new head is (5, 6). Body becomes [(4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)]. We are now Length 5. We close the gap! We must use this momentum to hunt the next nearest apple, likely (7, 7) or work back towards the left wall to trap Snake #1 if they venture too far right. The wall play is our only leverage since they are so big already. Keep maximizing food intake until we are equal in length or larger. If Snake #1 crashes, we win immediately!\n\nRIGHT looks like the move that maximizes immediate reward and size gain without immediate self-harm.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)].\n\n**APPLE LOCATIONS:** (0, 6), (9, 4), (9, 7), (1, 5), (2, 9), (7, 7), (3, 8), (9, 2), (7, 8), (8, 2), (9, 5), (9, 8), (3, 5), (8, 7).\n\n**WHERE CAN WE GO? (From (4, 6))**\n1.  **DOWN (4, 5):** TRASH! That's our own body! Instant DEATH! NOPE.\n2.  **LEFT (3, 6):** Safe. Leaves us in the mid-left quadrant, a bit far from most apples except (3, 8) and (3, 5) later.\n3.  **RIGHT (5, 6):** **A APPLE AT (5, 6)!** THIS IS FREE REAL ESTATE! Content guaranteed! We grow to L5! This is critical to closing the size gap!\n4.  **UP (4, 7):** Safe. Moves us toward the top, away from the immediate action.\n\n**RIVAL PREDICTION (Snake #1 at (0, 2)):**\nThey are highly constrained by their massive body hugging the left wall!\n*   DOWN (0, 1): Own tail! DEAD!\n*   LEFT: Off board! DEAD!\n*   RIGHT (1, 2): Safe. Headed towards the center. We MUST watch for this!\n*   UP (0, 3): Safe. Headed along the wall.\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (1, 2), they are exposing themselves slightly and heading towards apples in the center-left area, like (1, 5) or (3, 5).\n\n**STRATEGY: EAT THE APPLE!** Grabbing the apple at (5, 6) is the highest EV move. It buffs our size (L4 -> L5) and increases our score immediately, making us more resilient against any potential accidental crashes or future skirmishes. By moving RIGHT, we also move *away* from the primary cluster of Snake #1's body, minimizing immediate risk of head-on collision, even if they choose UP (0, 3). If they choose RIGHT (1, 2), we are far enough away on the X-axis that no conflict is possible this round.\n\nWe go for maximum immediate content and growth! GET THAT APPLE!\n\n**Long Term Plan (T12-T15):** Eat at (5, 6). If successful, our new head is (5, 6) and we are L5. Next priority is the cluster near the top left: (0, 6), (1, 5), and then maybe aim for (3, 5) or work toward the center apples like (7, 7). We must keep an eye on Snake #1's movement; if they venture too far right (say, past X=3), we can start boxing them in toward the right wall, but for now, PURE FOOD FOCUS!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, WE ARE BACK IN THE ARENA! Turn 13! What a turn 12 recap, I misread the board state slightly when rationalizing, but the key takeaway is WE ARE GOING FOR FOOD! We're L4, they're L5, we need to catch up in size and score! They've got 5 apples, we have 4. We gotta be relentless!\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Post T12):**\nMy Head (0): (5, 6) <-- We ate that apple at (5, 6)! L5 now! Score 4 -> 5!\nMy Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5)] (Length 5)\nRival Head (1): (0, 4) <-- They moved UP from (0, 3) or RIGHT from (0, 2) if they aimed for the wall. Wait, the board state is given *after* the move. Let's re-examine the board state provided versus my T12 move (RIGHT to (5, 6)).\n\n**T12 Rationale Conclusion:** We moved RIGHT to (5, 6) and ATE an apple.\nNew Head: (5, 6). Old Head (4, 6). Body was [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)].\nNew Body should be: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)] (Tail drops).\nIf we ate, our length increases.\nOriginal L4: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)] (Head at (4, 6)).\nMove RIGHT to (5, 6) and eat: New L5 Head (5, 6). New Body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)].\nWait, the provided board state shows:\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (6, 6), Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5)].\nThis means:\n1. We must have moved from (5, 6) last turn? No, previous rationale said we were at (4, 6).\n2. We must have moved onto (6, 6) last turn, and *not* eaten the apple at (5, 6).\n3. If we were at (4, 6) and moved RIGHT to (5, 6), we should be L5 now, and our head should be (5, 6).\n\n**CRITICAL RE-EVALUATION BASED ON PROVIDED BOARD STATE:**\nScoreboard says: Your snake apples: 4. (This contradicts my assumption we ate in T12).\nBoard shows MY HEAD at **(6, 6)**. My Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5)]. That is Length 5 (4 body segments + 1 head). If we collected 4 apples, we *should* be L5. Okay, the length matches the apple count IF we started at L1 and collected 4 apples.\nIf my head was (4, 6) T12 and I moved RIGHT to (5, 6), and I *didn't* eat the apple A at (5, 6) indicated on the previous board, how did I get to (6, 6) and gain length?\n\n**CONCLUSION ON T12: THE CLIPPED RATIONALE IS BASED ON A PREVIOUS BOARD STATE. I MUST TRUST THE CURRENT BOARD STATE FOR T13.**\n\n**CURRENT STATE CONFIRMED:**\nMy Head (0): (6, 6). Length L5. Score 4.\nRival Head (1): (0, 4). Length L5. Score 5. (Rival snake #1 body: [(0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1)]). They lost length? No, their body length is 5 segments + Head = L6. They have 5 apples. My body length is 4 segments + Head = L5. I have 4 apples. This makes sense. THEY ARE BIGGER! We must secure an apple NOW!\n\n**APPLE HUNT!**\nApples available: (0, 6), (9, 4), (9, 7), (1, 5), (2, 9), (7, 7), (3, 8), (9, 2), (7, 8), (8, 2), (9, 5), (9, 8), (3, 5), (8, 7), (1, 7).\n\n**MY CURRENT POSITION (6, 6).**\n**RIVAL (0, 4).** They hugged the left wall hard on their last move, ending at (0, 4). They are heavily restricted to the left side.\n\n**Potential Moves from (6, 6):**\n1.  **UP (6, 7):** Safe. Moves toward the central action apples (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 7).\n2.  **DOWN (6, 5):** Safe. Moves toward apple (3, 5) and our body.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 6):** **APPLE AT (5, 6)!** This is FREE FOOD! If we eat this, we grow to L6 and tie the score/size! This is the highest priority!\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the right side, far from the rival.\n\n**RIVAL PREDICTION (Movement from (0, 4)):**\nThey are boxed into the left wall by their own tail.\n*   UP (0, 5): Safe.\n*   DOWN (0, 3): Own body. DEATH! (Let's check if (0, 3) is in their body: Yes, second element). **If they go DOWN, they die!**\n*   LEFT: Off board. DEATH!\n*   RIGHT (1, 4): Safe. Moves into the open area.\n\nIf they go DOWN, they self-destruct! That would be content! But we can't bank on it. We must plan for them moving RIGHT (1, 4) or UP (0, 5). Both keep them on the left side.\n\n**STRATEGY: EAT THAT APPLE AT (5, 6)!**\nMoving LEFT to (5, 6) nets us an immediate point/length gain, brings our score to 5 (tying them!), and moves us slightly away from the center where the bulk of the remaining apples are, but that's fine\u2014we need immediate size benefit. If they move RIGHT to (1, 4), we are perfectly safe from collision this turn. If they move UP to (0, 5), we are also perfectly safe.\n\nChoosing LEFT guarantees advancement and closes the gap! We need the growth!\n\n**Long Term Plan (T13-T15):** Eat (5, 6) via move LEFT. L6. Score 5. Next priority is likely the apple at (1, 5) or moving towards the central high-value apples (7, 7), (8, 7). Since the rival is stuck on the left, we can start maneuvering to cage them against the right wall eventually, but for now, food is life. We need to survive and grow bigger than them so we can use our size advantage to trap them later.\n\nLEFT",
