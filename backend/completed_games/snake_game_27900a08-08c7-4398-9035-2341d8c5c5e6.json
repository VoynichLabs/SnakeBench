(5,7) is empty \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,5): Safe? (5,5) is empty \u2705  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,6): Safe? (4,6) is empty \u2705\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,6): Safe? (6,6) has an apple! \u2705\n\nAll directions are safe initially! No immediate death moves! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- Enemy head at (0,5) - they're on the opposite side of the board\n- We're at (5,6) - central position with more freedom\n- Apples are everywhere but we're not focusing on them, we're focusing on DOMINATION\n- Enemy has same score (0-0) - we need to gain advantage\n- Board is 10x10, we can box them in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nWe need to control the board. Since enemy is at left edge (x=0), we should move RIGHT to cut off their escape routes and force them into the bottom-left corner. As we grow, we'll create a wall between them and the rest of the apples. First, claim the right side, then sweep down-left to trap them. We'll use our body to create barriers. Always watch their head - if they try to break out, we intercept. Remember: head-on collisions favor the BIGGER snake. We'll eat apples to grow faster and become the threat.\n\n**TODAY'S MOVE:**\nI'm choosing RIGHT to (6,6) - it has an apple, gives us +1 point immediately (1-0 lead!), and moves us toward the right edge where we can start building our territorial wall. This puts us between the enemy and the right-side apples, giving us control of the central board. Also, moving right keeps us away from their immediate reach (they're at x=0, we're at x=5 \u2192 now x=6, even further). We'll eat, grow, and then sweep down to start boxing them in.\n\nChat, this is 5D chess! We're not just playing Snake, we're playing WAR! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

We need to keep expanding our territory while blocking the enemy from escaping to the right. Moving UP to (6,7) gets us closer to the top edge, where we can start curving down to form a wall.

Why?  \n- It keeps us safe and moves us toward the top-right corner, where we can later sweep down to cut off the enemy\u2019s path.  \n- It avoids moving toward the enemy (they\u2019re on the left, we\u2019re going up-right).  \n- It gives us more options next turn: we can go RIGHT to (7,7) for the apple, DOWN to (6,6), or LEFT to (5,7).  \n- We\u2019re staying aggressive and expanding our control.  \n\nChat, this is how you play to win\u2014not just to survive! We\u2019re building momentum and forcing the enemy into a corner. Let\u2019s keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5  \n\nUP",

(6,4) is an apple, then (7,2) and (7,0) are reachable. We're also moving TOWARD the enemy's general area to start boxing them in.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to sweep downward and create a barrier from (6,5) down to (6,0) or (7,0), effectively cutting off the enemy's access to the right side of the board. Once we establish that wall, we can curve left and dominate the center.\n\n**TODAY'S MOVE:**\nDOWN to (6,5) is the MOVE!

The enemy snake #0 is still chilling on the left with head at (4,1), body: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]. \n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1\ufe0f\u20e3 ELIMINATE DEAD MOVES (LIVE OR DIE):**\nFrom head at (6,3):\n- **UP \u2192 (6,4)**: That's our own body! \u26a0\ufe0f **DEAD** - instant self-crash!\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,2)**: Check the board...

EMPTY! \u2705 **SAFE**\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **SCORE: 5-3 in our favor!** \ud83d\udcaa We're dominating!\n- **Enemy position:** Still left side, not moving much. Their head at (4,1), body at (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). They could go DOWN to (4,0) or UP to (4,2) or LEFT to (3,1 - body) or RIGHT to (5,1). \n- **Apple radar:** We just ate (6,3)! Looking at the board, I see (5,3) is empty now, but there's (5,7) and (5,6) apples near top. Also (3,6) and (2,6) apples are in the middle!\n- **Our wall building:** Column 6 is our fortress! We have positions at (6,3) head, (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) - we're building that vertical barrier! Let's keep it!\n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n- **DOWN to (6,2)**: Continue building column 6 wall downward! From (6,2) we can go (6,1), (6,0) - open space! But is there an apple? Not immediately visible on board, but it keeps our wall strong. \n- **LEFT to (5,3)**: This is interesting! The board shows (5,3) is empty, and we can see there's an apple at (5,7) and (5,6) above us. Moving LEFT gives us access to the center-left region where there are apples at (3,6) and (2,6)! This could open up more apple routes!\n- **RIGHT to (7,3)**: Also empty! From there we could go (7,2) where there IS an apple! Board shows (7,2) has an apple! That's two moves away though.\n\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 THE WINNING PLAY:**\nChat, here's the play! We're at (6,3) with apple just eaten. We need to think about NEXT turn too! If we go DOWN to (6,2), we're continuing our wall but no apple immediately. If we go LEFT to (5,3), we're moving toward the center where apples are clustering - I see (3,6) and (2,6) in that region! \n\nBut wait - let's check the board more carefully. The enemy is on the left. We're on the right. We need to control space! Moving LEFT toward the center could cut off the enemy's potential routes upward! \n\nActually, looking at the apples list: we have (5,7), (5,6), (3,6), (2,6) - all in that central-left area! Moving LEFT to (5,3) positions us to climb up toward those apples on turn 10!\n\n**LET'S DO THIS:** **LEFT to (5,3)!** We're moving toward the apple cluster! We maintain board control, keep options open, and head toward more content! The enemy is stuck on the far left - we'll cut them off from the apples in the center!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Move LEFT to (5,3), then likely UP to (5,4) next turn, climbing toward the apple cluster at (5,6)/(5,7) while keeping column 6 as our defensive wall. We're expanding territory while the enemy is trapped on the left! \n\nLEFT",

EMPTY! \u2705 **SAFE**\n- **DOWN \u2192 (5,3)**: That's our own body! \u26a0\ufe0f **DEAD** - instant self-crash! (We came from there)\n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,4)**: Check the board... That's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e **SAFE** (and delicious!)\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (6,4)**: Check the board... That's our own body! \u26a0\ufe0f **DEAD** - instant self-crash!\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **SCORE: 6-3 in our favor!** \ud83d\udcaa We're dominating!\n- **Enemy position:** Head at (4,3), body: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1)]. They're still on the left. Their possible moves: UP to (4,4), DOWN to (4,2 - body), LEFT to (3,3), RIGHT to (5,3 - our body!).\n- **Apple radar:** We have an apple RIGHT NOW at (4,4) - one cell LEFT from our head! That's the closest apple on the board. Other apples: (5,6), (3,6), (2,6), (3,9), (4,8), etc.\n- **Our body:** We're at (5,4) with body extending right/down. If we eat an apple, we grow and extend our reach.\n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT to (4,4)**: This gets us the apple RIGHT NOW! \ud83c\udf4e +1 point, we grow to 7 apples! This positions us at (4,4) with the apple gone, ready to move UP to (4,5) or RIGHT to (5,4 - but that's now our body's next segment).\n- **UP to (5,5)**: Safe, moves toward apples at (5,6)/(5,7), but misses the immediate apple at (4,4).\n- **RIGHT and DOWN are DEATH!** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 THE WINNING PLAY:**\nChat, here's the play! The enemy is at (4,3) and WE ARE AT (5,4) looking LEFT at an apple at (4,4)! If we GO LEFT, we eat that apple and GROW! The enemy could potentially go UP to (4,4) at the same time... but wait! \n\n**CRITICAL MOMENT:** If we go LEFT to (4,4) to eat the apple, and the enemy goes UP to (4,4), that's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! Since we have MORE APPLES (6 vs 3), WE WIN the collision! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udca5\n\nBut actually, looking at the board... the apple at (4,4) is ALREADY there, meaning NO ONE is there yet. If we move there simultaneously with the enemy, it's a double death. However, the enemy might not go UP - they could go LEFT to (3,3) or RIGHT to (5,3 - which would kill them into our body). \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** Even if there's a collision at (4,4), we WIN because we have more apples (6 > 3). That's the RUTHLESS strategy! But actually, looking more carefully - if we eat the apple, we get +1 point to 7, making our lead even stronger.\n\n**BUT WAIT!** Let's think about the enemy's perspective: They see us at (5,4) and an apple at (4,4). If they go UP, they might expect us to also go for it. But if they're smart, they'll avoid the collision since they're behind. \n\n**THE REAL PLAY:** We go LEFT to (4,4), eat the apple, grow to 7 apples, and extend our lead! Even if the enemy goes UP, we WIN the collision with our higher score. If they go elsewhere, we just get free points!\n\n**LET'S DO THIS:** **LEFT to (4,4)!** We're being aggressive, grabbing the closest apple, and if there's a collision, WE WIN! This is the ruthless strategy that wins games!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat the apple at (4,4), then move UP to (4,5) or (4,6) to chase the next cluster of apples while keeping the enemy trapped on the left. Build our lead and dominate the board!\n\nLEFT",
