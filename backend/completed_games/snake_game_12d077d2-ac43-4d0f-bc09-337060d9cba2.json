Leaves open paths to (7, 7), (6, 8), and (8, 8) for next turn.\n- **DOWN (7, 7):** Moves toward the center of the board. Apple at (1, 7) is reachable in 2 moves (DOWN twice), but not directly. Apple at (3, 2) is reachable in 3 moves (DOWN twice, then LEFT 5 times or RIGHT 4 times). However, moving DOWN risks getting trapped if the enemy snake moves aggressively.\n- **LEFT (6, 8):** Moves toward the left edge. Apple at (3, 6) is reachable in 3 moves (LEFT twice, then DOWN twice). No immediate threats, but fewer options if the enemy snake grows.\n- **RIGHT (8, 8):** Moves toward the right edge. Apple at (9, 1) is reachable in 3 moves (RIGHT twice, then UP 7 times or DOWN 7 times). No immediate threats, but similar to LEFT in terms of future flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Prioritize Apple Accessibility**\n- **Apple at (3, 6):** Can be reached in 3 moves (LEFT twice, then DOWN twice). Moving LEFT now is a step toward this apple.\n- **Apple at (1, 7):** Can be reached in 2 moves (DOWN twice). Moving DOWN now is a step toward this apple.\n- **Apple at (9, 1):** Can be reached in 3 moves (RIGHT twice, then UP 7 times). Moving RIGHT now is a step toward this apple.\n\n**Best immediate apple target:** (1, 7) is the closest (2 moves away), but it\u2019s not directly reachable in one move. Moving DOWN now is the most efficient way to reach it in the next two turns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Avoid Head-On Collisions**\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 7). It has no body, so it can move freely.\n- If we move DOWN to (7, 7), the enemy snake could move DOWN to (3, 6) or RIGHT to (4, 7) or LEFT to (2, 7) or UP to (3, 8). None of these overlap with our position immediately, but moving DOWN now is the most direct path to (1, 7), which is a high-priority apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns)**\n1. Move DOWN to (7, 7) on turn 0.\n2. Move DOWN again to (7, 6) on turn 1 (if no collision).\n3. Move LEFT to (6, 6) on turn 2 (if no collision), then LEFT again to (3, 6) to collect the apple.\n   - Alternatively, if the apple at (1, 7) is collected first, prioritize that.\n4. Avoid getting trapped by the enemy snake. If the enemy snake moves toward us, adjust by moving LEFT or RIGHT to create space.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move**\nDOWN",

This determines its new position.\n*(If the enemy snake moved DOWN, its head is now at (2,6) and body at [(3,6)]. If it moved UP, its head is at (1,8) and body at [(2,8)]. If it moved LEFT, its head is at (1,6) and body at [(2,6)]. If it moved RIGHT, its head is at (1,8) and body at [(2,8)].)*\n\n---\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Possible Moves from (7,6)**\nPossible moves:\n- **UP:** (7,7) \u2192 Valid (within board).\n- **DOWN:** (7,5) \u2192 Valid (within board).\n- **LEFT:** (6,6) \u2192 Valid (within board).\n- **RIGHT:** (8,6) \u2192 Valid (within board).\n\nNo immediate risk of self-collision or off-board death.\n\n---\n### **Step 3: Prioritize Apple Accessibility**\n- **Apple at (3,6):** Closest (3 moves away: LEFT twice, then UP twice). If the enemy snake is at (2,6) or (3,6), this apple is contested.\n- **Apple at (1,7):** Reachable in 2 moves (DOWN once, then LEFT once). However, the enemy snake is likely near this area.\n- **Apple at (9,1):** Far but reachable in 3 moves (RIGHT twice, then UP 5 times).\n- **Apple at (0,2):** Far but reachable in 3 moves (LEFT 7 times, then UP twice).\n\n---\n### **Step 4: Avoid Head-On Collisions**\n- If the enemy snake moved **DOWN** from (1,7) to (1,6), its head is now at (1,6) and body at [(2,6)].\n  - **RIGHT to (8,6):** Safe, as no overlap with enemy path.\n  - **DOWN to (7,5):** Safe, but enemy could move toward us if it moves **DOWN** again.\n- If the enemy snake moved **LEFT** from (1,7) to (0,7), its head is now at (0,7) and body at [(1,7)].\n  - **RIGHT to (8,6):** Safe and efficient for reaching apples on the right.\n- If the enemy snake moved **RIGHT** from (1,7) to (2,7), its head is now at (2,7) and body at [(3,7)].\n  - **DOWN to (7,5):** Safe, but enemy could move **DOWN** to (2,6) or (2,5) next turn.\n- If the enemy snake moved **UP** from (1,7) to (1,8), its head is now at (1,8) and body at [(2,8)].\n  - **RIGHT to (8,6):** Safe and efficient for reaching apples on the right.\n\n---\n### **Step 5: Long-Term Strategy**\n- **Avoid getting trapped:** The enemy snake is small but could grow quickly. Moving toward the center (DOWN or RIGHT) keeps options open.\n- **Target (3,6):** If the enemy snake is not at (2,6) or (3,6), this apple is reachable in 3 moves. Moving **LEFT** now is the most direct path.\n- **Target (9,1):** If the enemy snake is not blocking the right edge, moving **RIGHT** now could set up a future path to this apple.\n- **Target (1,7):** If the enemy snake is not at (1,6), moving **DOWN** now could reach this apple in 2 turns, but it\u2019s contested.\n\n**Best move:** **LEFT** to (6,6) to start moving toward the apple at (3,6) while keeping future options open. This is the most direct path to an apple without immediate risk.\n\n---\n### **Long-Term Plan (Next 3 Turns)**\n1. Move **LEFT** to (6,6) on turn 2.\n2. Move **LEFT** again to (5,6) on turn 3 (if no collision).\n3. Move **LEFT** to (4,6) on turn 4, then **UP** to (4,7) on turn 5 to reach the apple at (3,6) on turn 6.\n4. If the enemy snake blocks this path, pivot toward **RIGHT** or **DOWN** to avoid collisions.\n\n---\n### **Final Move**\nLEFT",

Moving **LEFT** now is the most direct path.\n- **Apple at (9,1):** Far but reachable in 3 moves (RIGHT twice, then UP 5 times).\n- **Apple at (0,2):** Far but reachable in 3 moves (LEFT 6 times, then UP twice).\n- **Apple at (3,2):** Far but reachable in 3 moves (LEFT twice, then DOWN twice).\n- **Apple at (0,6):** Far but reachable in 3 moves (LEFT 6 times).\n\n---\n### **Step 4: Avoid Head-On Collisions**\n- Enemy snake is at (0,7) and (1,7). It could move **LEFT** to (0,6) or **RIGHT** to (0,8) or **UP** to (0,8) or **DOWN** to (0,6).\n- If the enemy snake moves **DOWN** to (0,6), it would collide with our snake if we move **LEFT** to (5,6) and then **LEFT** again to (4,6), etc. But this is unlikely since it would need to move **DOWN** from (0,7), which is off the board (invalid).\n- If the enemy snake moves **LEFT** to (0,6), it would be near the apple at (0,6). Our move **LEFT** to (5,6) is safe as the enemy snake is far away.\n\n---\n### **Step 5: Long-Term Strategy**\n- **Avoid getting trapped:** The enemy snake is small but could grow quickly. Moving **LEFT** now keeps us on a path toward the apple at (3,6) while maintaining flexibility.\n- **Target (3,6):** If we move **LEFT** now, we can reach this apple in 3 moves (LEFT twice, then UP twice). This is the most efficient apple to target.\n- **Alternative paths:** If the enemy snake moves toward us, we can pivot **UP** or **DOWN** to avoid collisions.\n\n---\n### **Long-Term Plan (Next 3 Turns)**\n1. Move **LEFT** to (5,6) on turn 3.\n2. Move **LEFT** again to (4,6) on turn 4 (if no collision).\n3. Move **UP** to (4,7) on turn 5, then **UP** to (3,7) on turn 6, and finally **LEFT** to (3,6) on turn 7 to collect the apple.\n4. If the enemy snake blocks this path, pivot toward **UP** or **DOWN** to avoid collisions.\n\n---\n### **Final Move**\nLEFT",

The enemy snake's body should not include the head's new position. Let me correct this:\n  - Body: [(4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (5, 8)] is invalid because the head's new position (5,8) should not be in the body list. The correct body after moving **RIGHT** from (4,8) to (5,8) should be:\n  - Body: [(4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7)] (since the head moves to (5,8) and the tail is now at (4,8)).\n  - Apples: 3 (collected the apple at (5,8))\n\n#### **Step 1: Enemy Snake Movement Prediction**\nFrom the last turn, the enemy snake moved **RIGHT** from (4,8) to (5,8). Now, its head is at (5,8) and its body is [(4,8), (4,7), (3,7)].\nPossible moves from (5,8):\n- **UP:** (5,9) \u2192 Valid.\n- **DOWN:** (5,7) \u2192 Valid.\n- **LEFT:** (4,8) \u2192 Collides with its own body (invalid).\n- **RIGHT:** (6,8) \u2192 Valid.\n\nThe enemy snake is now at (5,8) with an apple at (6,7). It could:\n- Move **UP** to (5,9) to stay in the top row and explore.\n- Move **DOWN** to (5,7) to get closer to the apple at (6,7).\n- Move **RIGHT** to (6,8) to explore or potentially threaten our path.\n\n#### **Step 2: Evaluate Possible Moves from (3,1)**\nPossible moves:\n- **UP:** (3,2) \u2192 Collides with your own body (invalid).\n- **DOWN:** (3,0) \u2192 Valid.\n- **LEFT:** (2,1) \u2192 Valid.\n- **RIGHT:** (4,1) \u2192 Valid.\n\n#### **Step 3: Apple Accessibility**\n- **Apple at (0,2):** Directly reachable by moving **DOWN** twice (but not this turn).\n- **Apple at (9,1):** Far but reachable.\n- **Apple at (7,9):** Far but reachable.\n- **Apple at (6,7):** Reachable but not immediately.\n- **Apple at (3,9):** Already collected by the enemy snake.\n\n#### **Step 4: Avoid Collisions**\n- The enemy snake is at (5,8) and will move this turn. If it moves **RIGHT** to (6,8), it won\u2019t interfere with our immediate moves.\n- If it moves **DOWN** to (5,7), it will be closer to the apple at (6,7) but still far from our current position.\n\n#### **Step 5: Long-Term Strategy**\n- **Target (0,2):** Moving **DOWN** to (3,0) and then **LEFT** twice would allow us to reach (0,2) in future turns.\n- **Alternative paths:** Moving **LEFT** to (2,1) or **RIGHT** to (4,1) keeps options open but doesn\u2019t immediately threaten the enemy.\n\n#### **Long-Term Plan (Next 2 Turns)**\n1. Move **DOWN** to (3,0) on turn 11 to position ourselves closer to the apple at (0,2).\n2. After moving to (3,0), evaluate whether to pivot **LEFT** toward (0,2) or move **UP** to explore other apples and avoid potential threats from the enemy snake.\n\n### **Final Move**\nDOWN",
