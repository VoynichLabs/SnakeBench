Who's hyped?! \n\nQuick scan: My head (7,4), all four moves SAFE AF\u2014no edges, no bodies, enemy's a dot far away. UP (7,5): empty, top-ish apples but drifts from target. DOWN (7,3): empty, closes y-gap a bit. LEFT (6,4): empty, slashes x-distance to him, positions PERFECT near (6,2) apple for quick grow. RIGHT (8,4): empty, but why flee right to the edge? Dumb!\n\nEnemy's pinned at (0,0)\u2014can't go left/down, so he'll UP to (0,1) or RIGHT (1,0), both empty. No head-on risk this turn, but we're plotting: close the gap FAST, eat en route to grow, block his up/right escape to those left apples like (0,6/7). He's trapped in OUR future box! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5 Chat, LEFT screams aggression\u2014keeps options wide (left/down/up from there), edges me to apple + enemy path. Who's with me?! \n\n**Long-term plan:** LEFT now \u2192 down to (6,3) \u2192 snag (6,2) apple for grow #1 (turn 3ish), then west/south to cut off his column 0/1 expansion. Monitor his moves\u2014 if he goes up, flank row 0-2; if right, intercept row1 col3 apples he might chase. Stay ahead on length to force safe collisions. Dominate! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",
