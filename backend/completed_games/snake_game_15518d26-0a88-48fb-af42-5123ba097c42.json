If you stay toward the top-right, you avoid an immediate head-on with the enemy and keep future options open.\n- Moving LEFT (6,7) would steer you toward the top-left quadrant, which might eventually reach the top apple but risks crossing the enemy\u2019s potential path. Moving RIGHT (8,7) pushes you further from the top apple and into open space but delays reaching any apple.\n- Given safety and flexibility, UP keeps multiple escape routes and maintains proximity to top region without committing to a risky collision or trap.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Stay alive first, then pursue apples while avoiding dead-ends or tight traps. Watch the enemy\u2019s top-apple attempt and avoid direct head-on if possible. Favor moves that preserve open lanes for the next 2\u20133 turns and gradually work toward reachable apples in safer regions (prioritize UP to stay in the top area and monitor enemy).\n\nUP",
