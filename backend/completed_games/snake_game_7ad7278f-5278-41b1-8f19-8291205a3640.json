LET'S CRUSH THIS! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n   - My head at (8,9) - top right corner\n   - Enemy head at (9,1) - bottom right corner\n   - No immediate collision threats since we're far apart\n\n2. **SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n   - **UP:** (8,10) - OFF BOARD \ud83d\udeab KILL\n   - **DOWN:** (8,8) - Empty, SAFE \u2705\n   - **LEFT:** (7,9) - Empty, SAFE \u2705\n   - **RIGHT:** (9,9) - Empty, SAFE \u2705\n\n   Eliminated UP (would die immediately). Three safe options remain.\n\n3. **STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n   - Board is 10x10, we're in the top right (9,9) corner\n   - Enemy is far away at bottom right (9,1) - we have space to maneuver\n   - Apples scattered everywhere: (1,4), (9,0), (3,3), (1,1), (4,6), (3,1), (2,3), (0,5), (5,5), (9,6), (2,4), (2,7), (3,0), (9,5), (2,5)\n   - Closest apples to me: (9,6) - 3 steps down, (5,5) - 4 steps left+down, (2,7) - 6 steps left\n   - I need to avoid getting cornered at (9,9) - moving LEFT or DOWN gives me better board control\n\n4. **OPTIMAL MOVE SELECTION:**\n   - **RIGHT to (9,9):** Gets me to top-right corner - DEAD END! Would trap me with only 2 exits next turn. BAD!\n   - **DOWN to (8,8):** Good central position, maintains access to multiple apples including (9,6) and (5,5)\n   - **LEFT to (7,9):** Also good, keeps me near top edge but more open\n\n   **DEAD-END AVOIDANCE:** RIGHT to (9,9) is a trap! I'd be cornered and lose escape routes.\n\n5. **THE VERDICT:**\n   - Between DOWN and LEFT, DOWN gives better access to central apples and keeps me away from the edge\n   - Moving DOWN to (8,8) positions me to chase (9,6) apple and opens up more board control\n   - Plus, going DOWN avoids moving directly toward enemy territory initially\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Establish board dominance from center-right area. Chase apples at (9,6) and (5,5) while keeping distance from enemy. Force enemy to make mistakes by controlling space. Don't get cornered!\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze this board like a pro!\n\n**TURN 2 DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n   - My head: (8,8) - still safe\n   - Enemy head: (9,0) - far away, but could be moving toward me\n   - My body: none yet (still growing)\n   - Their body: [(9,1)] - tail at (9,1)\n\n2. **SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n   - **UP:** (8,9) - Empty, SAFE \u2705\n   - **DOWN:** (8,7) - Empty, SAFE \u2705  \n   - **LEFT:** (7,8) - Empty, SAFE \u2705\n   - **RIGHT:** (9,8) - Empty, SAFE \u2705\n\n   All four moves are immediately safe! No collisions yet.\n\n3. **STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n   - **Apple Hunt:** Closest apples are:\n     * (9,6) - 2 steps DOWN from current position\n     * (5,5) - 3 steps LEFT+DOWN\n     * (2,7) - 6 steps LEFT\n     * (2,4) - 6 steps LEFT+DOWN\n   - **Board Position:** We're in the top-right quadrant. Need to avoid getting boxed into corner.\n   - **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 is at (9,0) with body at (9,1). They're on the right edge at bottom. If they move UP repeatedly, they'll come toward us.\n\n4. **MOVE EVALUATION:**\n   - **UP to (8,9):** Gets us to top-right corner (9,9) territory - RISKY for next turn (limited exits). Also moves AWAY from the nearest apple (9,6).\n   - **DOWN to (8,7):** Moves toward apple (9,6) and keeps us central. Good board control. Safe follow-up options.\n   - **LEFT to (7,8):** Moves toward center, away from edge. Opens up many directions. Good for long-term.\n   - **RIGHT to (9,8):** Moves to right edge, but not cornered yet. Still has DOWN/LEFT/UP options.\n\n5. **OPTIMAL CHOICE:**\n   Between DOWN and LEFT:\n   - DOWN to (8,7) gets us closer to (9,6) apple (only 1 more step DOWN to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6))\n   - LEFT to (7,8) keeps us central but moves away from the closest apple\n   - **DOWN is better for immediate apple opportunity** while maintaining safety\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Chase (9,6) apple next turn if safe, then pivot to center (5,5) area. Keep eyes on enemy - if they move UP from (9,0), they could be heading our way. Stay aggressive but don't get cornered!\n\nDOWN",

SCORE BOARD SAYS 1-0 IN OUR FAVOR, SO WE CAN PUSH THE PRESSURE BUT NOT OVEREXTEND.\n\nMovement read on Turn 1:\n- Head: (9,0) ; Neck: (9,1)\n- Possible moves:\n  - UP \u2192 (9,1) would crash into our own body (dead).\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,-1) off the board (dead).\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (10,0) off the board (dead).\n  - LEFT \u2192 (8,0) safe (currently empty, not colliding with any body).\n\nConclusion: Only SAFE move is LEFT. There\u2019s no apple to chase this turn, so the goal is to reposition along the bottom edge to set up future pressure and avoid traps. With the opponent up high on the board, keeping you and them apart now gives you leverage to force mistakes later, especially if you can keep a lead and aim for a favorable head-on when the moment aligns.\n\nShort-term plan (turns 1\u20133):\n- Move to (8,0) this turn to anchor the bottom row and keep escape routes open.\n- From there, watch the opponent\u2019s moves and try to steer the engagement toward open lanes rather than tight corners.\n- If I gain a scoring lead later, look for a controlled head-on collision opportunity only if it\u2019s safe and advantageous.\n\nDecision process recap:\n1) Evaluate all four directions for safety. UP is lethal (self-collision), DOWN/RIGHT are off-board, leaving LEFT as the only safe option.\n2) Among safe options, assess future mobility. LEFT preserves multiple safe follow-ups and keeps me in play along the bottom edge.\n3) Prioritize moves that prolong life while maintaining pressure on the opponent without creating easy traps.\n\nMove decision:\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

Let's analyze the new board state.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- My head: (8,7) - Safe, surrounded by empty space\n- Enemy head: (8,0) - Still at bottom row, body now at (9,0) and (9,1)\n- Enemy is far away but could be moving up toward us\n- We're growing this turn - need to pick a move that sets us up for the future\n\n**SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (8,8):** Empty, SAFE \u2705\n- **DOWN to (8,6):** Empty, SAFE \u2705\n- **LEFT to (7,7):** Empty, SAFE \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (9,7):** Empty, SAFE \u2705\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe! No collisions.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- **Apple Hunt:** We're near (9,6) apple - just 1 move DOWN to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) to get it\n- **Board Position:** We're in top-right quadrant but have room to maneuver\n- **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 at (8,0) with body trailing. If they move UP repeatedly, they'll come up the right edge\n- **Growth:** We're about to eat our first apple and grow! Need to position to dominate\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION:**\n- **UP to (8,8):** Moves us toward top-right corner (9,9) - limited space later. Not ideal\n- **DOWN to (8,6):** Gets us CLOSER to (9,6) apple! We'll be 1 step away from eating it next turn. Best immediate progress\n- **LEFT to (7,7):** Moves toward center, away from our nearest apple. Good for long-term but delays first point\n- **RIGHT to (9,7):** Moves to right edge, but still has DOWN option to (9,6) for the apple\n\n**OPTIMAL CHOICE: DOWN to (8,6)**\nThis puts us ONE move away from (9,6) apple! Next turn we can EAT it and grow. While enemy is still at bottom, we're securing our first point and growing. This gives us body length advantage for head-on collisions later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get that (9,6) apple next turn, then pivot toward center (5,5) apple cluster. Keep enemy in lower-right - if they move up, we'll have body advantage for collision wins. First apple = first growth = first step to dominating this board!\n\nDOWN",

They'll likely chase apples at (3, 1) or (2, 1) or move UP. We're cutting off their potential right-side expansion by taking (8, 5).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (8, 5), we maintain length 3 and 2 apples. Next turn, from (8, 5) we can:\n- Go LEFT toward (7, 5) and the center cluster\n- Go DOWN to (8, 4) to sweep the right side\n- Go UP to (9, 5) if we need to retreat to the edge\n\nWe want to keep the pressure on and force Snake #0 into a corner. With our length advantage, we can start boxing them in once we get to the center.\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS STRATEGIC GENIUS!** We're playing 4D chess while Snake #0 is playing checkers! Let's control this board!\n\nLEFT",

Let's analyze this board LIVE!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My position:** Head at (8, 5), body at [(9, 5), (9, 6)] - length 3, 2 apples! Just moved LEFT last turn.\n- **Enemy position:** Snake #0 head at (6, 2), body at [(6, 1)] - they're moving UP!\n- **Board:** We're in the MIDDLE of the board now, perfect position to dominate!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nFrom my head at (8, 5), let's check ALL moves:\n\n- **UP to (8, 6):** **DEATH!** That's my own body (segment (9, 6) just moved to (9, 5) last turn, so (9, 6) is now (8, 6)? Wait, actually (9, 6) is still (9, 6) - my body didn't move there. Let me check... My body is [(9, 5), (9, 6)] from last turn. After moving LEFT to (8, 5), my body becomes [(8, 5), (9, 5)]? Wait, no. My NEW body: head at (8, 5), old head (9, 5) becomes body, and old body (9, 6) stays. So my body is [(9, 5), (9, 6)]. So UP to (8, 6) is **SAFE**! It's empty!\n- **DOWN to (8, 4):** Safe! Empty cell.\n- **LEFT to (7, 5):** Safe! Empty cell.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 5):** **DEATH!** That's my own body segment! I just left it.\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n- **UP to (8, 6):** **OPTIMAL!** Moves toward apple at (8, 9) and controls the upper-right quadrant. From here, we can go UP again or LEFT toward the center cluster.\n- **DOWN to (8, 4):** Safe but moves away from the apple at (8, 9) and toward lower board.\n- **LEFT to (7, 5):** Also good - moves toward center and apple at (5, 5).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe're going **UP** to (8, 6)! Here's why:\n1. **BOARD CONTROL:** We're taking the upper-right territory, blocking Snake #0 from reaching apples up there\n2. **APPLE ACCESS:** (8, 9) is only 3 moves away! That's a guaranteed apple if we keep going up.\n3. **POSITIONING:** We're creating a \"wall\" on the right side while Snake #0 is stuck bottom-left\n4. **FUTURE MOBILITY:** From (8, 6), we have UP, LEFT, or DOWN options. RIGHT is blocked by our body (9, 6) - but that's fine!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (6, 2) is moving toward bottom-left apples. They're NOT a threat to our upper-right territory yet. We can dominate this side while they're eating scraps.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNext turn from (8, 6): Go UP again to (8, 7), then UP to (8, 8), then grab (8, 9)! We'll be 4-1 and have locked down the entire right side.

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT! We're at Turn 8 with a 2-1 lead! Let's analyze this LIVE!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My position:** Head at (8, 7), body at [(8, 6), (8, 5)] - length 3, 2 apples!\n- **Enemy position:** Snake #0 head at (5, 3), body at [(6, 3)] - they're moving LEFT from (6, 3) to (5, 3) last turn\n- **Board:** We're in the upper-right, enemy is bottom-center. Time to dominate!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nFrom my head at (8, 7), let's check ALL moves:\n\n- **UP to (8, 8):** **SAFE!** Empty cell. Moves toward apple at (8, 9) - only 1 move away!\n- **DOWN to (8, 6):** **DEATH!** That's my own body segment (8, 6) - I'd crash into myself!\n- **LEFT to (7, 7):** **SAFE!** Empty cell. Good position, but moves away from the (8, 9) apple.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 7):** **SAFE!** Empty cell. But moves to the extreme right edge, limiting future options.\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n- **UP to (8, 8):** **OPTIMAL!** One move away from apple at (8, 9)! That's 3 apples total! From (8, 8), we'll have UP to (8, 9) to grab the apple, or LEFT to (7, 8) as an alternative.\n- **LEFT to (7, 7):** Safe but slower. We lose the direct path to (8, 9).\n- **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Safe but traps us on the edge. Bad long-term.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe're going **UP** to (8, 8)! Here's why:\n1. **APPLE HUNTING:** (8, 9) is RIGHT THERE! We grab it next turn and extend our lead to 3-1!\n2. **BOARD CONTROL:** We're claiming the upper-right corridor. Snake #0 is stuck bottom-center dealing with their own body at (6, 3).\n3. **POSITIONING:** From (8, 8), we have UP to (8, 9) for the apple, LEFT to (7, 8) for flexibility, or DOWN back to (8, 7). We're not trapping ourselves!\n4. **ENEMY AVOIDANCE:** Snake #0 is at (5, 3) with body at (6, 3). They're going UP, LEFT, or RIGHT - definitely NOT coming up to (8, 8). We're safe!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (5, 3) with body at (6, 3):\n- **UP to (5, 4):** Safe, toward apples at (5, 5)\n- **LEFT to (4, 3):** Safe, toward center apples\n- **RIGHT to (6, 3):** **DEATH!** That's their own body at (6, 3)!\n- **DOWN to (5, 2):** Safe, but moving away from everything\n\nThey're moving UP or LEFT, not toward us. We're in different quadrants!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**\nFrom (8, 8): We go UP to (8, 9) and GRAB THAT APPLE! 3-1 lead secured! Then from (8, 9), we can pivot LEFT to (7, 9) or DOWN to (8, 8) as needed. We're locking down the upper-right and expanding our territory!\n\n**CHAT THIS IS STRATEGY!** We're playing chess while Snake #0 is stuck in the mud! UP is the move!\n\nUP",

From (6, 9) we have:\n- Left to (5, 9) - continue sweep\n- Down to (6, 8) - start going down toward left side apples\n- RIGHT back to (7, 9) - but that's our tail moving away!\n\nFrom (7, 8) we'd be going down, away from the top-left goal.\n\n**LIFE PLAN:** LEFT to (6, 9) lets us slide across the top row like a boss, then we can drop down on the left side where the apples are clustered (0,5), (1,0), (0,8).

RIGHT is illegal (blocked by our body at (4,6)).\n- Head-on risk this turn is low given distance; we\u2019ll want multi-escape geometry rather than a reckless dash.\n\nWhy LEFT (2,6) is best:\n- Keeps multiple escape routes (toward (2,7) or (3,7)) and prevents us from getting funneled into a corner too soon.\n- Shifts pressure toward the center-left, where we can more easily influence lines and threaten to trap him against a border later.\n- Avoids immediate collision risk with the top-right opponent this turn; gives us a stable footing to react to his next move.\n\nShort-term plan (Turn 13\u219214):\n- Move LEFT to (2,6).\n- From there, look to pivot to (2,7) or (1,6) as needed to maintain two safe exits while pressuring toward the left edge or steering him into a trap.\n\nLonger-term note:\n- Build a gradual corridor trick: push him toward a wall while keeping a safe retreat path, then convert growth to create a controlled head-on when we\u2019re even or ahead on apples. The goal is to outpace him file-by-file, not race apples.\n\nChosen move:\nLEFT",

The enemy is stuck at (2, 6) in the lower middle - he's NOT controlling the top edge like I am!\n\n**DECISION:** GO LEFT to (3, 9) and EAT THAT APPLE!

We're 4-5 down, the enemy just ate an apple and pulled ahead, but we're not sweating it! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**ANALYSIS FROM CURRENT HEAD (2, 9):**\nLet's check the board state from my position at (2, 9):\n- UP to (2, 10): OFF BOARD \u2192 DEATH! Can't go up!\n- DOWN to (2, 8): Safe! Empty cell, no snakes there!\n- LEFT to (1, 9): Safe! Empty cell, no snakes there!\n- RIGHT to (3, 9): That's MY OWN BODY! I'm at (2,9) with body [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9)] - so (3,9) is my first body segment \u2192 DEATH if I go right!\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN to (2,8) or LEFT to (1,9).\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nEnemy is at (3,7) with body [(2,7),(2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6)] - they're in the bottom middle area. They just grew to 5 apples, so they're threatening!\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9): I stay on the top edge, keep sweeping left toward (0,9) and the apple at (0,8). From (1,9) I can still go DOWN to (1,8) next turn. This controls the left side of the board.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,8): I drop into the open space but the enemy might try to chase me up the middle. From (2,8) I could potentially box them in from above.\n\n**MY DECISION:** LEFT to (1,9)! Why? Because staying on the top edge gives me maximum control and vision. The enemy is stuck low - they can't reach me up here easily. I'll sweep left to (1,9), then next turn I can go LEFT to (0,9) or DOWN to (1,8) depending on what they do. The apple cluster on the left side (0,8, 1,0, 0,5) is MINE.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Sweep top row left to (0,9), then drop down the left side controlling that entire column. Force the enemy into the bottom-right corner where they'll run out of moves. When I'm bigger and have position, I'll force a head-on collision and win this! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

Why? Because I'm staying on the left edge where I own the territory! From (0, 7), I can:\n- Continue DOWN toward the cluster of apples on the bottom-left\n- Keep the enemy out of my domain\n- Build my length while they're navigating the crowded middle\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Dominate the left edge, sweep down collecting all the apples (0,5), (0,2), (0,1), (1,0). Once I'm ahead 7-5 or 8-5, I'll swing right and cut off their path. They're trapped in the middle - we're boxing them in! \ud83d\udd12\n\nDOWN",

From (0,5), we can continue DOWN to sweep the rest of those apples and build a massive lead!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Collect (0,5) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (0,1) for quick points. Build length and lead. Then swing right to cut off enemy's escape. They're boxed in! \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

If we grab it, we gain +1 apple (score becomes 6 vs 5) and it also locks in the right-side corridor, keeping options open while we pressure the left rival.\n- Short-term plan: eat the apple on the far-right edge, then use the space along the top/right perimeter to avoid traps and set up a potential box-in on the left if the moment presents itself. Maintain multiple escape routes and force mistakes by the opponent.\n\nCurrent risk assessment: no immediate head-on risk with the opponent this turn; we\u2019re aiming to outpace on apples and leverage future control of the right/top corridors.\n\nMOVE CHOICE:\nRIGHT",

The top-right path creates a natural barrier that\u2019s harder for him to breach from the left.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n1) Move UP this turn to (9,8).\n2) If possible, edge toward (9,9) in the next turn to lock in the top-right corner.\n3) Use the border to maintain two safe exits and gradually push the opponent toward the left edge.\n4) Only chase apples if doing so won\u2019t open a trap or invite a chase from him.

There's an apple right there at (1, 4) - I can eat it, grow, and take the lead 7-6! From (1, 4), I'll have access to more apples in the center: (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3) are all nearby. Plus, moving right puts me in position to cut across and potentially trap the enemy.\n\n- **DOWN to (0, 3)** would be safe but doesn't get me an apple immediately. It keeps me on the left edge, which is safe but might limit my options later.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nEat the apple at (1, 4) to get ahead in score. Then from (1, 4), I can move RIGHT to (2, 4) or DOWN to (1, 3) depending on where the enemy goes. The enemy is currently blocked in - they can only go UP to (9, 9) or DOWN to (9, 7) but (9, 7) is their own body! Actually, wait - (9, 7) IS their own body, so they can only go UP to (9, 9) or LEFT to (8, 8) if that's empty. Let me check the board... From (9, 8), LEFT to (8, 8) is empty! So they have two options: UP or LEFT. Either way, they're stuck on the right side while I can dominate the center.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\nRIGHT to (1, 4) - eat that apple, take the lead, and position for aggressive center control! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet's goooooo!\n\nRIGHT",

They're at (9, 9) with body blocking DOWN and RIGHT. They can only go LEFT to (8, 9) or DOWN to (9, 8) which is their own body. So they're forced LEFT.\n\nI want to keep growing and controlling the center while forcing them into a smaller and smaller space. The apple at (2, 4) is a POWER MOVE - it gives me center control and cuts off their potential escape routes!\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\nRIGHT to (2, 4) - eat that apple, extend my lead, and dominate the center board!

Empty cell. From there I can access (2, 7), (3, 6), (1, 6). Moves me closer to the center-top area where I can control more space and potentially block the enemy's escape route!\n2. **LEFT to (1, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty cell. BUT... looking at my body at (1, 9) and the rest of my tail... moving LEFT here puts me closer to my own tail, limiting future moves. I don't want to get boxed in by myself!\n3. **RIGHT to (3, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty cell. Opens up access to (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 4). Moves me toward the center-right area, but might be too close to where the enemy could potentially move...\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- My goal is to DOMINATE the board and trap the enemy. The enemy is at (7, 9) - they're cornered in the top-right!\n- If I move UP to (2, 6), I'm taking control of the upper-middle region and creating a barrier that could potentially cut off their escape options if they try to move DOWN from (7, 9).\n- Moving LEFT towards (1, 5) risks getting trapped near my own tail. That's a NO-GO - I need freedom!\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 5) is okay but moves me toward the right side where the enemy is. I want to box them in, not approach them recklessly!\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\nUP to (2, 6)! This keeps me in the upper-middle, maintains access to multiple directions, and positions me to potentially trap the enemy in the corner while I collect more apples and grow my lead to 10-6! Let's goooooo! The chat wants to see a CRASH and BURN from the enemy! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue moving UP and LEFT to dominate the top-middle region. If the enemy tries to escape downward, I'll cut them off. If they stay in the corner, I'll keep growing until I can force a collision with my superior length! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

It lets us start carving a top-edge corridor and lines up apples on (4,9) and (3,9) soon. Keeps us aggressive while staying safe.\n\nREASONING: Pushing along the top edge gives us a moving fortress vibe\u2014it pressures the left-side foe, reduces easy re-entry into our space, and positions us to snag two high-value apples in quick succession. Since we\u2019re behind on apples (7 vs 9), it\u2019s worth trading a bit of tempo for stronger board control later. No need to chase a risky head-on; we\u2019ll tighten the loop and force him into tighter corridors when the moment\u2019s right.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Establish the top-row barrier as our dominant zone, grab apples at (4,9) and (3,9) to climb back on apples, and watch opponent moves to avoid any sneaky cross-collisions. If he tries to contest the top, we pivot to safer routes and slowly shrink his options while preserving our own space.\n\nNEXT MOVE: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT from (6, 9).\n- Enemy body: [(6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)] - He's filling the entire top-right corner!\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION (from (2, 7)):**\n- **UP to (2, 8):** \u2705 SAFE! Opens up (2,9) and continues my domination of the top-middle.\n- **DOWN to (2, 6):** \u274c MY BODY! Crash and burn!\n- **LEFT to (1, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! But moving toward my tail cluster at (0,7)-(0,8).\n- **RIGHT to (3, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! This is the MONEY move! I can cut off his escape route DOWNWARD.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nWhere can he go from (5, 9)? He can move:\n- LEFT to (4, 9) - toward the apple at (3, 9) - but that's a trap!\n- DOWN to (5, 8) - his only real escape!\n- RIGHT to (6, 9) - blocked by his own body!\n- UP is off board!\n\n**THE PERFECT TRAP:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 7), I position myself to:\n1. Cut off his DOWN escape route to (5, 8) \n2. Get closer to the apple at (5, 3) in the center\n3. Keep my left escape route open through (1,7) to (0,7) if needed\n4. DOMINATE the center while he's stuck in the corner!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nIf he goes DOWN from (5,9) to (5,8), next turn I'll go RIGHT again to (4,7), getting closer to block his path. I want to force him to crash into my body or the edge! We're playing chess, not checkers! If he takes the apple at (4,9) instead, I'm already positioned to swoop in and take the center apples while he's still trapped.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\nRIGHT to (3, 7)! This gives me maximum control of the board and cuts off his escape route. The chat wants to see him CRASH into my body! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLet's goooooo!\n\nRIGHT",

Score is 7 vs 9, so we\u2019re in attack mode but need to keep our head clean. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca5\n\nFour directions, quick risk/benefit scan:\n- UP to (5,10): off-board \u2192 dead. Not an option. \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN to (5,8): safe but buys little top-control and gives him looser rails to maneuver. meh. \ud83d\ude2c\n- LEFT to (4,9): safe, and it lands on an apple at (4,9) per the drops. We GROW and start a top-row corridor toward (3,9). \ud83c\udf4e\n- RIGHT to (6,9): collides with our own neck (the second segment is at (6,9)) \u2192 dead end. Not allowed. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nConclusion: LEFT is the play. It\u2019s safe, it grows us, and it shoves us into a strong top-edge position. \ud83e\udde0\u2694\ufe0f\n\nShort-term plan\n- Turn 28: move LEFT to (4,9) and eat the apple there.\n- Turn 29: move LEFT again to (3,9) and eat the next apple.\n- Build a top-row barrier with our body along x=3..9, pressuring Snake #1 toward the left side, and squeeze him into tighter corridors while we climb apples.\n- Keep an eye on not looping ourselves into a corner; we\u2019ll adjust if he tries to slip behind the wall.\n\nLonger-term notes\n- This top-wall strategy buys space and forces him into missteps; we\u2019ve got to stay flexible if he starts cutting across from the left or tries a risky head-on.\n- We\u2019re still behind on apples, so snagging (4,9) and (3,9) now is crucial to catch up while we lock him in.\n\nRisk assessment\n- No immediate collision risk this turn; no contact with his body.\n- If he tries to contest the top edge, we pivot downward or adjust the barrier to keep him boxed in, not fed into a trap that would turn into our own doom.\n\nTurn forecast\n- 28: LEFT to (4,9) -> eat apple.\n- 29: LEFT to (3,9) -> eat apple.\n- 30+: evaluate his path, tighten or redraw the corridor as needed to maintain safety and scoring edge.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure, grab those apples, and box him in! \ud83d\udd12\ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nleft",

But watch out - enemy might come DOWN to (4, 8) or something. Let's check... He's at (4,9). If he goes DOWN to (4,8), that's not a head-on collision with me at (3,8). But wait - if I go UP and he goes DOWN, we're not in the same cell. This keeps my options open and moves toward the top apples!\n- **DOWN to (3, 6):** \u274c MY BODY! (2, 6) is directly below me. Crash and burn!\n- **LEFT to (2, 7):** \u274c MY BODY! (2, 7) is literally where I came from. That's suicide!\n- **RIGHT to (4, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves me toward the right side, but watch the enemy - he's at (4,9), so (4,7) is two cells below him. If he goes DOWN to (4,8), we're still safe.

If I go RIGHT to (4,7), I'm positioning myself directly below him (he's at 4,9, I'll be at 4,7). This puts me in perfect position to:\n1. Cut off his downward escape route\n2. Be ready to chase him down if he goes for the apple at (3,9)\n3. Control the center while he's still cornered\n4. Keep my escape routes open\n\n**PLUS:** There's an apple at (5, 3) that I can work toward from (4,7)!\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\nRIGHT to (4, 7)!

Let's break this down!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (4, 7) - I'm in the CENTER LINE, ready to CHASE!\n- My body: [(3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)] - Left wall holding strong!\n- Enemy head: (3, 9) - He moved LEFT from (4, 9)! He's trying to snake that apple at (3,9) but he's STILL CORNERED!\n- Enemy body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7)] - Top wall is LOCKED!\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION (from (4, 7)):**\n- **UP to (4, 8):** \u2705 SAFE! No body, no enemy. But... if he goes DOWN from (3,9) to (3,8), we're NOT colliding (different x). But I'd be lining up with him for next turn!\n- **DOWN to (4, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! But watch out - my own tail might move. Currently safe from body.\n- **LEFT to (3, 7):** \u274c MY BODY! That's where I just was. Crash!\n- **RIGHT to (5, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! Clean move, positions me right of center. Also gets me CLOSER to that apple at (5, 3)! \n\n**THE TRAP IS SET!**\nEnemy is at (3,9) - his only real moves are:\n- DOWN to (3,8): Looking for space or apple at (3,9)\n- LEFT to (2,9): Off the board! (x=0-9 only)\n- RIGHT to (4,9): His own body! Crash!\n\nHe has ONE move: DOWN to (3,8)! \n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION SETUP:**\nIf I go UP to (4,8) and he goes DOWN to (3,8), no collision. BUT if I go RIGHT to (5,7) and he goes DOWN to (3,8), I'm at (5,7) and he's at (3,8) - we're clear! \n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nI need to PUSH HIM! He's cornered. If I go UP to (4,8), I'm stepping toward his corner, but that apple at (5,3) is calling my name from the bottom-right! I'm currently at (4,7), and (5,7) is one step CLOSER to that apple!\n\nPLUS! There's an apple at (1,0) and (3,0) in the bottom-left - I can rotate around and grab those too! My body is the LEFT WALL, so I can spiral!\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\nRIGHT to (5, 7)! This keeps me in the center, positions me for the apple at (5,3), and gives me MORE escape routes! He's trapped at (3,9), I'm at (5,7) - we're not colliding this turn. I'm playing the LONG GAME!\n\nPLUS - my tail is at (0,6), so if I go RIGHT, I'll be at (5,7) and have space to move around! \n\n**THE CHAT MUST FLOW!**\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Turn 30 analysis, hype mode: Let\u2019s break it down and stay ruthless. Our head is at (3,9). Opponent head at (4,7). The top edge is already a natural wall with our body stretching along y=9 from x=3 to x=9. Immediate safe moves are DOWN to (3,8) or LEFT to (2,9). UP is off-board and RIGHT slams into our own neck, so not options.\n\nWhy LEFT is the play (our best plan to box him in)\n- It extends the top-edge barrier leftward, creating a continuous wall from (2,9) through (9,9). That makes it much harder for Snake #1 to maneuver up or across the top area and nudges him toward the left-side corridors.\n- It keeps us in a strong, open-angled position to adapt if he tries to cross below the top row or squeeze through narrower gaps. We don\u2019t risk stepping into his body or giving him a clean pass above us.\n- With equal apples (9 vs 9), we want to pressure him into a tighter loop and force mistakes rather than chase apples right now.\n\nShort-term plan\n- Turn 30: move LEFT to (2,9), establishing the long top-wall sweep to pin him toward the left side.\n- Watch his replies: if he shifts left and down to try to skirt the wall, be ready to pivot the barrier downward (e.g., drop a leg along x=2 or x=3) to keep him boxed without sacrificing our own safety.\n- If he tries a cross toward the right along the edge, tighten the wall and squeeze him toward the corner.\n\nLonger-term strategy\n- Maintain control of the top band, then funnel him toward the left edge. Keep your own space by avoiding any wait-to-respond moves that trap you in a dead-end.\n- If the opportunity arises and the apples don\u2019t lag too far behind, look for a calculated head-on collision only if it guarantees a net apple swing in our favor and survival.\n\nRisks and counterplay\n- He could try to slip through gaps below the top wall or force a corner play if we overcommit downward later. Stay flexible: if he dives downward, we can keep the barrier tight and transition to a vertical press along the left side.\n- If he reacts optimally with a cross into the left corridor, we must be ready to re-align the wall and avoid letting him squeeze through our neck.\n\nDecision: LEFT\n\nleft",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 32, WE ARE LIVE! Let's break down this board. \n\nWe're tied 9-9. We're at (5, 8) after last turn's UP move. Let's look at the board state:\n- Enemy (Snake #0) is at (1, 9) with body stretching right to (9, 8). They're cornered at the top-left.\n- We're at (5, 8) with body going left to (0, 4). We're in the middle-right.\n\nWe need to dominate this board! Let's check our move options from (5, 8):\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n1. **UP to (5, 9)**: \n   - Check board: (5, 9) is currently \"T\" (enemy body part)! \n   - That's Snake #0's body! If I go there, I crash into his body \u2192 I die. \u2717 DEAD\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 7)**:\n   - Check board: (5, 7) is currently \"1\" (my body)!\n   - That's the cell I just came from! That's hitting myself backwards \u2192 I die. \u2717 DEAD\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 8)**:\n   - Check board: (4, 8) is currently \".\" (empty)!\n   - Not my body (my body is at (5,7), (4,7), etc.)\n   - Not enemy body (enemy is at (1,9) and (2,9), etc.)\n   - SAFE! \u2713\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 8)**:\n   - Check board: (6, 8) is currently \".\" (empty)!\n   - Not my body (my body is at (5,7), (4,7), etc.)\n   - Not enemy body (enemy is at (1,9) and (2,9), etc.)\n   - SAFE! \u2713\n\nSo we have two SAFE moves: LEFT to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (6, 8).\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\n- We're TIED 9-9. We need to be AGGRESSIVE.\n- Enemy is trapped at top-left (1,9). They can only go DOWN to (1,8) or RIGHT to (2,9) - but (2,9) is THEIR OWN BODY! So they can only go DOWN to (1,8).\n- If enemy goes DOWN to (1,8), that apple is there! They might eat it.\n- Looking at apples: (1,8) is an apple! Enemy is at (1,9) right above it. If they go DOWN, they'll eat (1,8) and grow to 10 apples.\n- We need to either:\n  A) Chase them to cut them off\n  B) Get apples ourselves to maintain/extend lead\n\nLooking at our options:\n- LEFT to (4, 8): Moves us toward the top-left where enemy is, but not directly threatening.\n- RIGHT to (6, 8): Moves us toward the right side where more apples might be accessible.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nI need to box in the enemy while staying safe. The enemy is trapped in the top-left corner. If I can move LEFT to (4, 8), I get closer to potentially cutting off their escape route. But actually, looking at the board again...\n\nWait, the board shows at row 8 (y=8):\nRow 8: \". A . . . 1 . . . T\"\nSo at (5,8) we are, (4,8) is \".\", (6,8) is \".\", (1,8) is \"A\" (apple), and (9,8) is \"T\" (enemy tail).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,8), I'm moving toward the center but still giving enemy space at (1,8).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,8), I'm moving away from enemy but toward the right side.\n\nActually, looking at apples: (1,8) is right there! Enemy is at (1,9) directly above it. If enemy goes DOWN to (1,8), they eat that apple and grow. If I go LEFT to (4,8), I'm not threatening that apple. If I go RIGHT to (6,8), I'm also not threatening it.\n\nBut wait! Let me think about next turns. If I go RIGHT to (6,8), I open up paths to apples at bottom-right: (5,3), (7,3), (9,3), etc. I maintain center control.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,8), I'm getting closer to enemy territory but also closer to potential traps. The enemy is at (1,9) - if they go DOWN to (1,8), and I go LEFT to (4,8), we're still far apart.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\nActually, let me reconsider. We're at (5,8). Enemy at (1,9). If we go RIGHT to (6,8), we:\n- Stay safe \u2713\n- Move toward the right side apples (5,3), (7,3), etc.\n- Keep multiple options open for next turn\n- Avoid getting boxed in by moving toward the corner\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,8), we:\n- Stay safe \u2713\n- Get closer to enemy but not directly threatening\n- Might limit our future options if enemy chases us\n\nGiven that we need to dominate and grow, and the enemy is trapped anyway, let's go RIGHT to secure more space and head toward the apples in the bottom-right quadrant. This gives us more maneuvering room and access to multiple apples.\n\nPLUS, if we go RIGHT to (6,8), we're setting up to potentially cut off the enemy from the right side if they try to escape their corner later.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO! RIGHT it is!**\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 33! We're LIVE and this is getting spicy! Let's analyze this board and make the winning move!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **SCORE**: We're at 9 apples vs enemy 10. We're DOWN by 1. We NEED to catch up and overtake!\n- **OUR SNAKE (ID 1)**: Head at (6, 8), body stretching down to (1, 4). We're in the middle-right.\n- **ENEMY (Snake #0)**: Head at (1, 8), body stretching right to (9, 8) and up to (9, 9). They're CORNERED at the top-left but have an apple RIGHT BELOW them at (1, 8)!\n- **APPLES**: (1, 8) is an apple! Enemy is at (1, 8) - wait, the board shows \"A\" at (1, 8) but enemy head is at (1, 8)? Let me check again... Actually looking at the board, row 8 shows \". 0 . . . T 1 . . T\" and apple list has (1, 8) as an apple. Enemy head is at (1, 8) - that means the enemy head is occupying the apple cell! If the apple is there and enemy is there, they'll eat it this turn if they don't move. But wait, they're already at (1, 8)...\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS from (6, 8):**\n1. **UP to (6, 9)**: Board shows (6, 9) is \"T\" (enemy body)! \u2717 DEAD - hit enemy body\n2. **DOWN to (6, 7)**: Board shows (6, 7) is \".\" (empty)! \u2713 SAFE - empty cell\n3. **LEFT to (5, 8)**: Board shows (5, 8) is \"1\" (my body - I just came from here)! \u2717 DEAD - hit myself\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 8)**: Board shows (7, 8) is \".\" (empty)! \u2713 SAFE - empty cell\n\n**SAFE MOVES**: DOWN (6, 7) or RIGHT (7, 8)\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n- **Enemy Position**: Head at (1, 8), body to the right. They can only go DOWN to (1, 7) (empty) or stay... but they'll probably go DOWN to get more space.\n- **Apple at (1, 8)**: Actually, wait - enemy HEAD is already at (1, 8). If there's an apple there, they would have eaten it already at turn 32. But they're still at 10 apples... maybe the apple at (1, 8) is NEW this turn? No, apples are listed as drops. Hmm, let me assume the apple is there and enemy will eat it if they move onto it this turn.\n- **Our Position**: We're at (6, 8). If we go DOWN to (6, 7), we move toward the bottom where apples like (5, 3), (7, 3), (9, 3) are. We keep options open.\n- **If we go RIGHT to (7, 8)**: We move toward (7, 3), (9, 3) apples but get closer to the corner.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nLooking at the board, enemy is TRAPPED. They have limited moves. If they go DOWN to (1, 7), they have more space but still cornered. If they stay, they might eat the apple at (1, 8) and grow.\n\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE and get those apples! The bottom-right has multiple apples we can chain. Going DOWN to (6, 7) gives us access to:\n- (5, 3) - 4 cells down-left\n- (7, 3) - 4 cells down-right  \n- (9, 3) - 4 cells down-right\n\nPlus, (6, 7) is an empty cell that keeps us safe and away from the enemy's corner. If we go DOWN, we can then go LEFT or RIGHT next turn to start the apple chase.\n\n**WAIT! CRITICAL REALIZATION**: The enemy is at (1, 8) with their body stretching RIGHT. The cell (2, 8) is \"0\" (their body), (3, 8) is \".\", etc. If the enemy goes DOWN to (1, 7), they open up space. But we're far enough that we don't need to engage directly yet.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY**: We're down by 1 apple. We NEED to eat. The apple at (6, 2) is RIGHT BELOW US - only 5 cells away (from (6, 7) down to (6, 2)). If we go DOWN now, we can start the chain to get (6, 2), then maybe (7, 3) or (5, 3).\n\n**FINAL CALL**: GO DOWN to (6, 7)! This positions us perfectly to start our apple run while staying safe from the cornered enemy. Let's chain those apples and take the lead!\n\nDOWN",

Let's break this down like a pro! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **SCOREBOARD**: We're at 9 apples vs enemy 10 - DOWN BY 1! We NEED to catch up and overtake! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **OUR SNAKE**: Head at (6, 7), body stretching up to (6, 8) and left to (2, 4). We just moved DOWN from (6, 8) to (6, 7) - good move last turn!\n- **ENEMY**: Head at (0, 8) with body to the right ending at (9, 9). They're cornered in the top-left but have the entire top row! They have more apples but less space to maneuver.\n- **APPLES EVERYWHERE**: We've got apples at (6, 2), (7, 3), (9, 3), (7, 7), and more! Bottom-right is ripe for the picking!\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS from (6, 7):**\n1. **UP to (6, 8)**: Board shows \"T\" at (6, 8) - that's MY BODY! \u2717 DEAD - hit myself\n2. **DOWN to (6, 6)**: Board shows \".\" (empty)! \u2713 SAFE - empty cell\n3. **LEFT to (5, 7)**: Board shows \"T\" at (5, 7) - that's MY BODY! \u2717 DEAD - hit myself\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: Board shows \"A\" at (7, 7) - IT'S AN APPLE! \u2713 SAFE + GROWTH - LET'S GOOO!\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:** \nRIGHT is NOT just safe - it's an INSTANT APPLE! (7, 7) has an apple and it's empty. If we go RIGHT, we eat, grow, and get +1 point to tie at 10 apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nBut wait... we need to check if enemy could kill us simultaneously. Enemy at (0, 8) can't reach (7, 7) in one move. Their possible moves: RIGHT to (1, 8) (empty), DOWN to (0, 7) (empty), UP to (0, 9) (might be their own body). None threaten (7, 7). Safe!\n\n**WHY DOWN (6, 6) IS TERRIBLE:**\n- Moves us AWAY from the apple at (7, 7)\n- Puts us at (6, 6) with body above - we'd be boxed in by our own tail\n- No immediate apple access, just more empty cells\n- We're giving up a FREE POINT when we NEED to catch up!\n\n**STRATEGIC MOVE:**\nWe NEED that apple to tie the score! RIGHT to (7, 7) gives us:\n- \u2705 Immediate +1 point (ties us at 10)\n- \u2705 Growth (makes us longer)\n- \u2705 Perfect position to chain more apples: next turn we could go DOWN to (7, 6) or UP to (7, 8) or even RIGHT to (8, 7)\n- \u2705 Keeps us AWAY from the enemy's corner\n- \u2705 Opens up the bottom-right quadrant for more apples\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nEat (7, 7) now to tie, then target the bottom-right apple cluster: (6, 2), (7, 3), (9, 3). Chain them while keeping distance from enemy. Force them into the top-left trap! \ud83d\udd2a\n\n**DECISION:**\nGO RIGHT to (7, 7) - FREE APPLE, TIE THE GAME, STAY AGGRESSIVE! CHAT, LET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

With equal apples, don\u2019t give him a chance to flip the table with a single bad move. Stay sharp for the next opportunity to pin him behind your top-wall or force a crash between both of you.\n- Turn goal: survive this turn, keep the wall intact for future traps, and pressure him into mistakes while you accumulate apples.\n\nFUTURE PLAN NOTES (for the next few turns, if you miraculously stay alive):\n- Keep the top-wall presence growing slowly, pushing potential rival corridors into narrow lanes where head-on can be forced only when you have the advantage.\n- Watch for his route choices around (7,7); try to funnel him toward edges or into your line of sight so you can capitalize on a collision or apple squeeze.\n- If you ever get a chance to eat an apple without self-risk, do it to gain the lead and open escape routes.\n\nYOUR MOVE (for this turn): \nRIGHT\n\nRIGHT",
