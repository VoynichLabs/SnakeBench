If I move down, we might conflict.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n\n- **Up**: (8, 9)\n\t- This would keep me near the edge, where I\u2019m less likely to encounter Snake #0 immediately.\n\t- It\u2019s away from the nearest apple but leaves options open.\n- **Right**: (9, 8)\n\t- Moves me closer to the edge and away from immediate conflict.\n\t- However, this direction offers fewer future choices.\n- **Left**: (7, 8)\n\t- Moves me toward the apples at (4, 3) and (1, 2).\n\t- (1, 2) is the closest, and I\u2019d grab it in one step.\n- **Down**: (8, 7)\n\t- Moves me closer to Snake #0 but is the most direct route to the apple at (1, 2).\n\n### Strategy:\n\nI want to prioritize safety and efficiency. Grabbing the apple at (1, 2) quickly is a good move since it\u2019s low-risk and nearby. After that, I could plan a path to avoid Snake #0 and collect other apples strategically.\n\n### Decision:\n\nI\u2019ll move **DOWN** to (8, 7).\n\nYour next move will depend on the board state after collecting the apple.
