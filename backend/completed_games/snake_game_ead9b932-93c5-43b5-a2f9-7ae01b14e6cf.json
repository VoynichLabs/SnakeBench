If I go UP, my body blocks (7,7), so DOWN next turn is blocked. If I go RIGHT, my body blocks (7,7), so LEFT next turn is blocked. Symmetric.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Tie-breaker:**  \nLook at apple (7,1) for future: from (7,8) it\u2019s farther than from (8,7) in vertical distance, but both require moving down.  \nAlso, enemy at (0,4) might go for (0,8) apple, so if I take (7,8) now, I deny that apple from being reachable by enemy soon.  \n\nActually, enemy is far, so (0,8) is closer to enemy than (7,8) is. Taking (7,8) doesn\u2019t deny enemy much.  \n\nBut moving RIGHT to (8,7) leaves (7,8) apple still there for next turn if I want it, but enemy can\u2019t reach it soon anyway.  \n\nI think either is fine, but maybe UP first because it\u2019s closer to center top, then next turn I can go LEFT to (6,8) or RIGHT to (8,8) to keep options open.  \n\nWait \u2014 if I go UP, next turn from (7,8) I can\u2019t go DOWN into my body, but I can go LEFT/RIGHT/UP. If I go RIGHT, next turn from (8,7) I can\u2019t go LEFT into my body, but I can go UP/DOWN/RIGHT.  \n\nBoth fine. Let\u2019s pick UP to take (7,8) now, then next turn decide based on safety.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (7,8), aim to stay safe, maybe go LEFT to (6,8) to keep distance from right edge, then later target (8,7) or (7,1).

Next turn from (4,8): UP (4,9) enemy head? possibly, DOWN (4,7) empty, LEFT (3,8) empty, RIGHT (5,8) my body \u2192 2 safe moves if enemy not at (4,9).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Evaluate enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy at (4,9) with apples 3, body length 4. It likely wants apple at (5,9). It might go RIGHT unless it sees collision risk with me. But it doesn\u2019t know my move. If I go UP, collision possible. If I go LEFT or DOWN, enemy likely goes RIGHT and eats apple.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nIf I avoid apple, enemy gets it and extends lead (4 apples vs my 2). That\u2019s bad long-term.  \nIf I go UP, there\u2019s a 50% chance enemy goes RIGHT \u2192 collision \u2192 both die \u2192 I lose (enemy has more apples). But if enemy goes DOWN, I get apple safely.  \nGiven scores, I\u2019m behind. Taking a risk to get apple might be necessary, but dying is worse.  \n\nBetter: go LEFT to (4,8). This puts me adjacent to enemy\u2019s possible DOWN move to (4,8) \u2192 if enemy goes DOWN, we collide head-on at (4,8)? Wait, if enemy goes DOWN to (4,8) and I go LEFT to (4,8), we collide. That\u2019s also risky.  \n\nCheck: enemy DOWN to (4,8) is possible. My LEFT to (4,8) is possible. So LEFT also has collision risk.  \n\nDOWN to (5,7) avoids any possible enemy move this turn (enemy can\u2019t reach (5,7) in one move). Safest.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nIf enemy eats apple at (5,9), it will be at (5,9) with length 5. I\u2019ll be at (5,7). From there, head toward (2,2) or (7,1) while keeping distance from enemy. Avoid head-on until I catch up in length.  \n\nDOWN",

Enemy body currently at (5,9),(4,9),(3,9),(2,9) \u2192 (4,9) is enemy body \u2192 invalid. DOWN (4,7) my body, LEFT (3,8) empty, RIGHT (5,8) my body \u2192 only 1 safe move (LEFT). Risky.  \n\n- DOWN to (4,6):  \n  Next turn from (4,6): UP (4,7) my body, DOWN (4,5) empty, LEFT (3,6) apple (if apple still there, I eat and grow), RIGHT (5,6) empty \u2192 2 safe moves if apple eaten, 3 if not? Wait, if I eat apple at (3,6) next turn, my tail grows so body will be longer, but (4,7) still body. So DOWN and RIGHT safe, LEFT leads to apple. Actually LEFT to (3,6) is safe (apple cell is not a body). So 3 safe moves next turn from (4,6).  \n\n- LEFT to (3,7):  \n  Next turn from (3,7): UP (3,8) empty, DOWN (3,6) apple (safe), LEFT (2,7) empty, RIGHT (4,7) my body \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo UP is bad (only 1 safe follow-up). DOWN and LEFT both give 3 safe follow-ups.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy future threat:**  \nEnemy length 5 vs my length 3. If enemy goes DOWN to (6,8), it\u2019s closer to center but still far from me if I go DOWN/LEFT. If enemy goes RIGHT to (7,9), it\u2019s farther.  \nI should avoid moving toward enemy while I\u2019m shorter.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN and LEFT both keep me safe and maintain mobility.  \nLEFT moves me closer to apple (3,6) in x-direction, but DOWN also moves me closer in y-direction.  \nFrom (4,7), DOWN to (4,6) then LEFT to (3,6) is same distance as LEFT to (3,7) then DOWN to (3,6).  \nBut DOWN to (4,6) keeps me farther from enemy head\u2019s possible location (6,8 or 7,9) than LEFT to (3,7).  \nAlso, if enemy goes DOWN to (6,8), it could threaten (5,7),(5,6) area soon.  \nI\u2019ll choose DOWN to (4,6) to start moving toward apple while staying more central for future options.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (4,6), move LEFT to (3,6) to eat apple if still there. Keep checking enemy head location to avoid head-on collisions. If apple gone, consider (2,2) or (1,3) next, but prioritize safety over chasing distant apples.\n\nDOWN",

Eating apples now helps catch up (they have 4 apples, I have 3).  \nChoosing DOWN to (2,2) leaves apple (1,3) still available next turn if I go LEFT after.  \nChoosing LEFT to (1,3) leaves apple (2,2) still available next turn if I go DOWN after.  \n\nBut note: after eating an apple, my tail stays in place (growth), so my body occupies more space next turn.  \nFrom (2,2) next turn, I can go LEFT to (1,2) and then UP to (1,3) to get the other apple if still there.  \nFrom (1,3) next turn, I can go DOWN to (1,2) and then RIGHT to (2,2) if still there.  \n\nBoth are symmetric in terms of future apple access.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Tie-breaker:**  \nEnemy is on the right side of the board. Moving LEFT toward (1,3) keeps me farther from enemy. Moving RIGHT is away from apples.  \nLEFT seems slightly safer in terms of staying away from enemy\u2019s possible path toward center.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (1,3) and eating apple, next turn I\u2019ll aim for (2,2) if safe, or move toward (3,0) if enemy moves near. Keep monitoring enemy head\u2019s possible moves to avoid head-on collisions.  \n\nLEFT",

That would tie apples at 7 each if I don\u2019t eat now.  \nTo maintain lead, eating (2,2) now is strong.  \nAlso, after eating (2,2), I can go DOWN to (2,1) or LEFT to (1,2) next turn, still having options.  \nLEFT to (1,3) delays eating but gives more flexibility.  \n\nGiven I have a 1-apple lead, securing another apple now is good.  \nDOWN is safe and grows me, reducing risk of being trapped later.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Plan for next turns**  \nAfter DOWN to (2, 2) and eating:  \n- Next turn from (2,2), consider DOWN to (2,1) or LEFT to (1,2) depending on enemy position.  \n- Enemy may be at (4,6) if it ate apple, or still near top right.  \n- Keep moving toward bottom left area to collect (2,0) later, while watching enemy\u2019s path.  \n- Avoid moving back into my long body until tail moves further.  \n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s okay but limited.\n\nIf LEFT to (1, 1):  \nBody: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)] (tail (5,2) gone).  \nFrom (1,1):  \nUP (1,2) empty.  \nDOWN (1,0) empty.  \nLEFT (0,1) empty.  \nRIGHT (2,1) body \u2192 invalid.  \nThree safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good mobility.\n\nIf RIGHT to (3, 1):  \nBody: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)] (tail (5,2) gone).  \nFrom (3,1):  \nUP (3,2) empty.  \nDOWN (3,0) empty.  \nLEFT (2,1) body \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (4,1) empty.  \nThree safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Strategic choice**  \nEating apple now gives me 9 apples vs enemy 7 (enemy hasn\u2019t eaten this turn). That\u2019s a 2-apple lead.  \nBut eating apple at (2,0) leaves me at bottom edge with only two exits next turn.  \nIf I eat apple, enemy may go for (6,4) or (0,3).  \nI can survive after eating if I choose LEFT or RIGHT next turn.  \nLEFT move now gives mobility but delays eating.  \nGiven the lead is valuable, I should eat the apple now.  \nAlso, enemy could go toward (6,4) or (0,3) next; if I eat (2,0), I deny it from enemy reach later.  \n\nCheck safety after eating:  \nFrom (2,0), LEFT (1,0) is safe and opens more space.  \nFrom (2,0), RIGHT (3,0) is safe but leads toward center where enemy might be.  \nI\u2019ll plan to go LEFT next turn after eating to stay near bottom-left open area.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Plan for next turns**  \nMove DOWN to (2,0) and eat apple.  \nNext turn, likely go LEFT to (1,0) unless enemy threatens.  \nThen work toward (0,3) or other apples while keeping mobility.  \nWatch enemy movement toward (6,4) or (9,8).  \n\nDOWN",

So DOWN is a trap.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Strategic choice**  \nDOWN leads to certain death next turn (only one cell to move into, all blocked or off board).  \nUP leads to apple (0,3) next turn and keeps me alive with options.  \nEnemy is far, no immediate threat.  \nI have a 1-apple lead; securing (0,3) extends lead to 10 vs 8.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Plan for next turns**  \nMove UP to (0,2).  \nNext turn, eat apple at (0,3) unless enemy somehow threatens it (unlikely).  \nAfter eating, from (0,3) consider RIGHT to (1,3) to open space, then maybe toward (3,0) later.  \nWatch enemy movement; they may head toward (8,8) or (9,8)/(9,9).  \n\nUP",

Since moves are simultaneous, I must avoid that risk unless I think enemy won\u2019t go LEFT.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Assess enemy\u2019s likely move**  \nEnemy\u2019s body occupies (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (7,4).  \nFrom (7, 7):  \n- DOWN to (7, 6) is open and moves toward apple cluster at y=2.  \n- LEFT to (6, 7) is open but leads toward my territory; enemy might avoid because I\u2019m at (5, 7) and could move RIGHT.  \nGiven enemy\u2019s current path (it\u2019s been moving around top-right), DOWN seems more natural to pursue apples. But I can\u2019t assume.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk elimination**  \nRIGHT is risky due to possible head-on collision at (6, 7).  \nUP and DOWN are safe regardless of enemy\u2019s move.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple: (5, 2) \u2192 Manhattan distance = |5-5| + |2-7| = 0 + 5 = 5.  \nFrom (5, 7):  \n- UP to (5, 8): distance to (5, 2) = 0 + 6 = 6 (worse).  \n- DOWN to (5, 6): distance = 0 + 4 = 4 (better).  \n- RIGHT to (6, 7): distance = 1 + 5 = 6 (worse).  \n\nDOWN reduces distance to closest apple.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \nIf DOWN to (5, 6):  \nBody: [(5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2)] (tail (0,1) gone)  \nFrom (5, 6):  \nUP \u2192 (5, 7): body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN \u2192 (5, 5): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4, 6): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6, 6): empty.  \nThree safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf UP to (5, 8):  \nBody: [(5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2)] (tail (0,1) gone)  \nFrom (5, 8):  \nUP \u2192 (5, 9): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (5, 7): body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4, 8): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6, 8): empty.  \nThree safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Strategic choice**  \nDOWN is safer (no head-on risk) and moves toward (5, 2).  \nEnemy might go DOWN to (7, 6) toward (7, 2) or (8, 2). That\u2019s fine \u2014 we\u2019re both heading to different apples.  \nMy path to (5, 2) from (5, 6) is clear: next turn DOWN to (5, 5), then (5, 4), etc.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo DOWN now to (5, 6), then continue descending toward (5, 2). Monitor enemy\u2019s movement \u2014 if enemy goes LEFT to (6, 7), it will be adjacent horizontally but not colliding.

New head (3,1), old head becomes new second segment, tail (1,6) disappears. So my body now: head (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), \u2026 up to (1,7)? Wait, last turn\u2019s body ended with (1,7) as last segment before tail? Actually last turn\u2019s body list: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)] \u2013 that\u2019s 12 segments.

So my current body length is still 12 (head + 11).  \n\nApples: (3,0), (2,4), (7,0), (0,0), (0,4) \u2013 unchanged.  \nEnemy head: (9,1) (since enemy moved DOWN from (9,2) to (9,1) last turn? Wait, enemy\u2019s possible moves last turn were UP/DOWN; if enemy moved DOWN, head now (9,1); if UP, head (9,3). From board state given now: enemy head at (9,1). So enemy moved DOWN.  \nEnemy body: [(9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8)] \u2013 length 14 segments + head = total length 15 (since apples 14 means length 15).  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Immediate safety from (3, 1)**  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 2): my body (second segment) \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 0): apple, safe (eat and grow).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 1): empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 1): empty, safe.  \n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (9, 1)**  \nFrom (9, 1):  \nUP \u2192 (9, 2): its body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9, 0): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8, 1): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nEnemy safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy can go to (9,0) or (8,1).

Wait, after eating, my old head (3,1) becomes second segment, so (3,1) is my body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,0): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,0): empty.  \nOnly 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nLEFT to (2,1):  \nFrom (2,1):  \nUP \u2192 (2,2): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2,0): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1,1): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3,1): my old head \u2192 invalid.  \n3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nRIGHT to (4,1):  \nFrom (4,1):  \nUP \u2192 (4,2): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN \u2192 (4,0): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,1): my old head \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,1): empty.  \n2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Growth and enemy path**  \nEating apple gets me to 13 apples, enemy has 14, still behind by 1.  \nBut DOWN leaves me in corner (3,0) with only 2 exits next turn, which could be risky if enemy approaches. However enemy is far (distance at least 6).  \n\nLEFT (2,1) gives better mobility and moves toward (0,0) apple.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nEating apple now is tempting, but cornering myself could be dangerous later. However, the apple is right there, and I can still escape left or right next turn.  \nLEFT keeps options open and moves toward (0,0) but delays eating.  \nGiven enemy is far, securing food and catching up in score seems good.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo DOWN to eat (3,0) apple. Next turn, move LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0) depending on safety. Then aim for (0,0) or (2,4) while avoiding enemy\u2019s long body in top-right.  \n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s risky\u2014could trap me next turn.  \n\nUP to (1, 1):  \nFrom (1, 1):  \nUP \u2192 (1, 2): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (1, 0): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (0, 1): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2, 1): empty.  \n3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Much better mobility.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nIf I eat (0,0) apple now, I\u2019ll be at (0,0) with only UP safe next turn\u2014enemy far away but I could get stuck along top-left edge.  \nIf I go UP to (1,1), I keep flexibility, move toward (2,4) or (0,4) apples, and avoid trapping myself.  \nEnemy at (7,0) will likely move LEFT to (6,0) or RIGHT to (8,0) to avoid hitting its own body; either way not threatening me immediately.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP is safer long-term\u2014preserves options. Eating (0,0) now risks immediate low mobility next turn. Better to stay flexible and target apples later.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter UP to (1,1), consider moving toward (0,4) or (2,4) via left/up moves, while monitoring enemy. Enemy length 16 vs my 13, so need apples but safely.  \n\nUP",

From there, it can go UP to (5, 2) (my body), DOWN to (5, 0) (its body), LEFT to (4, 1) (its body), RIGHT to (6, 1) empty. So likely RIGHT to (6, 1).

Possibly, but not intersecting next turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nWe need 17 more apples to win (30 total). Enemy needs 15 more. We\u2019re behind by 2 apples. Need to collect faster but safely.  \n\nRIGHT to (2, 4) gives good mobility and keeps distance from enemy\u2019s predicted (5, 1) \u2192 (6, 1).  \n\nLEFT to (0, 4) traps me a bit in the left edge with only 2 moves next turn, which could be risky if enemy approaches later.  \n\nUP to (1, 5) avoids eating apple now but keeps flexibility; however, we need to catch up in apples, so eating now is better.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT to (2, 4) is safe, gives an apple, and leaves 3 safe moves next turn. Enemy not in collision course.  \n\nRIGHT",

Hard to predict, but not an immediate head-on threat to me.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 9), (4, 3), (8, 4)  \n\nFrom (3, 4):  \n- (4, 3) is 2 steps away: RIGHT then DOWN or DOWN then RIGHT.  \n- (0, 4) is 3 steps LEFT but blocked by my body at (2, 4) and (1, 4) currently.  \n- (8, 4) is 5 steps RIGHT.  \n- (1, 9) far.  \n- (0, 0) far.  \n\nClosest reachable apple is (4, 3).\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Path to (4, 3) safely**  \nIf I go DOWN to (3, 3): next turn from (3, 3) to (4, 3) is RIGHT, but check safety next turn:  \nFrom (3, 3): UP (3, 4) will be my body after I move down, so not safe next turn; DOWN (3, 2) my body; LEFT (2, 3) empty; RIGHT (4, 3) apple. So only 2 safe moves next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4): from (4, 4) next turn, DOWN (4, 3) apple, LEFT (3, 4) my body, UP (4, 5) empty, RIGHT (5, 4) my body. So only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN).  \n\nIf I go UP to (3, 5): from (3, 5) next turn, UP (3, 6) empty, DOWN (3, 4) my body, LEFT (2, 5) empty, RIGHT (4, 5) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nUP \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN \u2192 2 safe moves next turn.  \nRIGHT \u2192 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nUP keeps more options open.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy at (6, 1) is far; no immediate collision risk.  \nBut if enemy goes UP to (6, 2), then (6, 3), could approach apple (8, 4) or (4, 3) from below later.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI\u2019m 1 apple behind (14 vs 15). Need to collect safely.  \nApple (4, 3) is tempting but moving directly toward it now (DOWN or RIGHT) reduces mobility next turn.  \nBetter to take UP now to keep options open, then approach (4, 3) from (3, 5) via (3, 4) next turn? Wait, (3, 4) will be my body next turn if I go UP now, so can\u2019t go back there.  \n\nActually:  \nIf I go UP to (3, 5), next turn from (3, 5) I can go DOWN to (3, 4)? No, (3, 4) will be my body segment (2, 4) after I move? Let\u2019s check:  \nMy body after moving UP: head (3, 5), then (3, 4) is not in body list yet \u2014 wait, my current body is [(2, 4), (1, 4), ...]. After moving UP, new body: head (3, 5), then old head (3, 4) becomes first body segment, then (2, 4), (1, 4), ... So (3, 4) will be my body next turn. So from (3, 5), DOWN is not safe.  \n\nSo UP now gives from (3, 5): safe moves UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nFrom (3, 5) I can go RIGHT to (4, 5), then DOWN to (4, 4), then DOWN to (4, 3) apple in 3 turns.  \n\nAlternatively, if I go RIGHT now to (4, 4), next turn DOWN to (4, 3) apple. That\u2019s faster. But is it safe?  \n\nCheck (4, 4) to (4, 3) next turn:  \nEnemy might be at (6, 2) or (7, 1) \u2014 not near (4, 3) next turn. My own body: from (4, 4) to (4, 3) is safe unless my body moves into it? My tail is at (5, 4) now, will move to (5, 3) next turn if I eat apple? Wait, if I go RIGHT to (4, 4) now, I don\u2019t eat apple. Next turn from (4, 4) DOWN to (4, 3) eats apple. That\u2019s safe.  \n\nBut going RIGHT now to (4, 4) means next turn only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN), but one is DOWN to apple, so fine.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Risk of trapping**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4), my body surrounds (4, 3) area: (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 2), (3, 3) empty, (3, 4) body. After eating apple at (4, 3), I\u2019ll have length 16, tail at (5, 2) will move to (5, 3)? Actually tail movement: when eating, tail doesn\u2019t move that turn, so after eating at (4, 3), my body grows, tail stays at (5, 4)? Let\u2019s track: current body last segment (5, 4). If I move RIGHT to (4, 4) now, body becomes: head (4, 4), then (3, 4), (2, 4), \u2026 (5, 4) still last. Next turn DOWN to (4, 3) apple: new head (4, 3), add (4, 4) to body, tail (5, 4) stays, new segment added at head, so length 16, tail still (5, 4) until next move.  \n\nSo area near (4, 3) after eating: my body at (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 3) empty, (3, 4) body, (3, 5) empty. So from (4, 3) after eating, possible moves: UP (4, 4) body, DOWN (4, 2) body, LEFT (3, 3) empty, RIGHT (5, 3) body. Only LEFT is safe \u2014 that\u2019s a trap.  \n\nSo eating apple (4, 3) from (4, 4) next turn leads to being trapped with only 1 safe move. That\u2019s dangerous if enemy approaches.\n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Better approach**  \nMaybe go UP now to (3, 5), then RIGHT to (4, 5), then DOWN to (4, 4), then DOWN to (4, 3) \u2014 but by then apple might be gone (enemy could take it).  \n\nEnemy path to (4, 3): from (6, 1), needs 5 moves minimum, so probably safe for 2 turns.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check if (4, 3) is safe to delay:  \nEnemy at (6, 1) \u2192 (6, 2) \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 (5, 3) my body \u2192 blocked. So enemy can\u2019t easily get (4, 3) before me if I go soon.\n\nGiven the trap risk, maybe avoid (4, 3) for now, go UP to keep mobility, aim for (8, 4) or (1, 9) later.\n\n**Step 10 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP keeps most options open, avoids trap, stays safe from enemy.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (3, 5), consider moving toward (8, 4) via rightward moves, or if enemy moves toward (4, 3), maybe take it from north side (4, 5) \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3) with escape route leftward.\n\nUP",

UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5) body, LEFT (2,6), RIGHT (4,6) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- LEFT to (2,5): next turn from (2,5), UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4) body, LEFT (1,5) empty, RIGHT (3,5) body \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n- RIGHT to (4,5): next turn from (4,5), UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4) empty, LEFT (3,5) body, RIGHT (5,5) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Path to (4,3) safely**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (4,5), next turn I can go DOWN to (4,4), then DOWN to (4,3) apple.  \nCheck safety after eating (4,3): from (4,3), possible moves: UP (4,4) body, DOWN (4,2) body, LEFT (3,3) empty, RIGHT (5,3) body \u2192 only LEFT safe. That\u2019s a trap.  \n\nIf I go UP to (3,6), then RIGHT to (4,6), DOWN to (4,5), DOWN to (4,4), DOWN to (4,3) \u2014 too slow; enemy might take (4,3) before me.  \n\nEnemy path to (4,3): from (6,2) \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 (5,3) my body \u2192 blocked unless my body moves. My body at (5,3) will move if no apple eaten? Tail is at (5,3) currently? Wait, my tail is (5,3) from body list? Let\u2019s check: my body ends with (5,3). So (5,3) is my tail. If I don\u2019t eat apple, tail moves next turn. So enemy could go (6,3) \u2192 (5,3) after my tail moves? Possibly, but risky for them.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Alternative plan**  \nApple (8,4) is open, enemy might go for (4,3) or (8,4). I could aim for (8,4) via rightward moves, keeping space.  \n\nFrom (3,5), RIGHT to (4,5) is good: moves toward (8,4), keeps mobility.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid head-on risk**  \nEnemy at (6,2) moving UP to (6,3) or DOWN to (6,1) \u2014 no overlap with my possible moves.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term**  \nI\u2019m 1 apple behind (14 vs 15). Need apples but avoid traps.  \nGoing RIGHT now toward (8,4) seems safe and opens options.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (4,5), consider moving toward (8,4) via (5,5) etc., or if enemy moves away from (4,3), maybe approach it from above later. Keep mobility high.  \n\nRIGHT",

But enemy could go LEFT to (5,3) this turn, then next turn go LEFT to (4,3) \u2014 same turn I\u2019d go DOWN to (4,3) from (4,4). That\u2019s a possible head-on collision if we both target (4,3) next turn.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,5), I move toward (8,4) and avoid that risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom (4,5):  \n- UP to (4,6): next turn from (4,6), safe moves? UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5) body, LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- DOWN to (4,4): next turn from (4,4), safe moves? UP (4,5) body, DOWN (4,3) apple (but check enemy), LEFT (3,4) my body, RIGHT (5,4) empty \u2192 only RIGHT safe if (4,3) is risky. Actually, if apple at (4,3) is still there, DOWN to (4,3) is safe unless enemy moves there same turn. But if enemy goes LEFT to (5,3), then (4,3) is contested next turn.  \n- RIGHT to (5,5): next turn from (5,5), UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4), LEFT (4,5) body, RIGHT (6,5) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nUP and RIGHT give good mobility. DOWN risks head-on next turn if enemy goes LEFT now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s likely move**  \nEnemy might go LEFT to (5,3) to be near apple (4,3) or to block me. If enemy goes UP to (6,4), they\u2019re moving toward (8,4) maybe.  \n\nGiven enemy has 15 apples (1 more than me), they might play safe and avoid head-on. But if they go LEFT to (5,3), they\u2019re adjacent to apple (4,3) and also adjacent to my body at (4,2) and (5,2) \u2014 that\u2019s risky for them because if they go further left next turn into (4,3), they could hit my body if I move.  \n\nActually, my body after this turn: if I move UP/RIGHT/DOWN, my tail (5,2) moves away unless I eat apple. So (4,3) could be free next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of head-on**  \nIf I go DOWN to (4,4) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,3), next turn we could both go to (4,3) \u2192 both die. That\u2019s bad.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (6,4), then (4,3) is safe for me to take next turn.  \n\nBut I can\u2019t know enemy\u2019s move. Safer to avoid that gamble since I\u2019m behind by only 1 apple \u2014 no need for risky tie.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nGo RIGHT to (5,5) \u2192 opens path to (8,4) apple, keeps mobility high, avoids possible head-on over (4,3).  \nFrom (5,5), next turn I can go RIGHT to (6,5) or DOWN to (5,4) toward (8,4) or back toward center.  \n\nEnemy might take (4,3) apple, but that\u2019s okay \u2014 I\u2019ll target (8,4) and stay safe.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (5,5), move toward (8,4) via (6,5)-(7,5)-(8,5)-DOWN or similar, watching enemy\u2019s position. Keep space, avoid boxing myself in left side where my long body is.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, (5,2) is empty in board diagram \u2014 yes, it\u2019s empty).  \nLEFT (4,3): empty.  \nRIGHT (6,3): enemy\u2019s own body (first segment after head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (4,3) is 2 steps away from me: DOWN to (5,4) then LEFT to (4,4) then DOWN to (4,3)? Actually from (5,5) to (4,3): shortest path length 3 (DOWN-LEFT-DOWN).  \n- (8,4) is 3 steps away via RIGHT-RIGHT-DOWN.  \n- (1,9) far.  \n- (0,4) blocked by my body along x=1, y=4.  \n- (0,0) far.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,4), enemy could also go UP to (5,4) \u2192 head-on collision this turn. That\u2019s a risk.  \nIf I go UP to (5,6), I avoid immediate collision risk.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (6,5), I move toward (8,4) and avoid enemy\u2019s possible moves.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check head-on risk this turn**  \nEnemy at (5,3) could go UP to (5,4). If I go DOWN to (5,4), we collide. So DOWN is risky unless I\u2019m sure enemy won\u2019t go UP.  \nEnemy could also go LEFT to (4,3) or DOWN to (5,2).  \nGiven enemy\u2019s body layout, UP to (5,4) is safe for them (empty), so they might take it.  \nThus DOWN is dangerous.\n\nUP and RIGHT have no possible same-cell collision with enemy this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom (5,5):  \n- UP to (5,6): next turn safe moves? UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5) body, LEFT (4,6), RIGHT (6,6) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- RIGHT to (6,5): next turn safe moves? UP (6,6), DOWN (6,4), LEFT (5,5) body, RIGHT (7,5) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- DOWN to (5,4): risky due to possible head-on this turn, and next turn from (5,4) if enemy not there: UP (5,5) body, DOWN (5,3) enemy head now at (5,3)? Wait, enemy moves this turn, so next turn enemy won\u2019t be at (5,3) necessarily. But still, from (5,4) next turn, possible moves: LEFT (4,4), RIGHT (6,4), UP (5,5) body, DOWN (5,3) possibly empty or enemy body. So 2 or 3 safe moves depending.\n\nBetter to avoid DOWN because of immediate head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI\u2019m behind by 1 apple. Need to collect apples safely.  \n(8,4) is reachable via RIGHT path.  \n(4,3) is contested \u2014 enemy could take it this turn if they go LEFT to (4,3). If they do, then (4,3) apple gone, and I should target (8,4).  \nGoing RIGHT now positions me toward (8,4) and keeps me safe from enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP is safe but moves away from both nearest apples.  \nRIGHT is safe and moves toward (8,4).  \nDOWN is risky (possible head-on).  \n\nChoose RIGHT to progress toward apple (8,4) and maintain mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (6,5), move toward (8,4) via (7,5) then (8,5) then DOWN, or if enemy blocks, go UP/DOWN to reposition. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s location \u2014 they may go for (4,3) apple, leaving (8,4) for me.\n\nRIGHT",

No, enemy at (4,3) is 4 steps from (8,4) (right 4, up 1). I\u2019m 3 steps away. But enemy could move toward it if they go UP to (4,4) then right etc.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn**  \nEnemy at (4,3) cannot reach my possible destinations this turn because:  \n- My UP (6,6) \u2013 enemy max move is 1 cell, so no.  \n- My DOWN (6,4) \u2013 enemy would need to move to (5,4) then me to (6,4) \u2192 not same cell. Actually enemy could go UP to (4,4), not (5,4). So no direct collision possible this turn with any of my safe moves.  \n\nSo all three safe moves avoid immediate head-on.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility & danger zones**  \nFrom (6,5):  \n- UP to (6,6): next turn safe moves? UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5) body, LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- DOWN to (6,4): next turn safe moves? UP (6,5) body, DOWN (6,3) enemy body at (6,3) currently, but enemy moves now so maybe vacated? Wait, enemy at (4,3) could move to (5,3) but that\u2019s not (6,3). Actually (6,3) is enemy body segment (second segment) now; after enemy moves, that segment shifts to (5,3) if enemy goes RIGHT? No, enemy can\u2019t go RIGHT into (5,3) because it\u2019s their own body. So (6,3) will become enemy\u2019s tail maybe? Let\u2019s check: enemy body length 16, head at (4,3), body: (5,3), (6,3), \u2026 So if enemy moves UP to (4,4), new head (4,4), body becomes [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), \u2026] so (6,3) still occupied. So (6,3) will be enemy body next turn regardless. So DOWN to (6,4) next turn DOWN to (6,3) is unsafe. So from (6,4) next turn: UP body, DOWN enemy body, LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4) \u2192 only 2 safe moves.  \n\n- RIGHT to (7,5): next turn safe moves? UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5) body, RIGHT (8,5) \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nSo DOWN reduces future options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple path safety**  \nIf I go RIGHT toward (8,4), enemy could also head that way via (4,4) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 etc. But I\u2019m closer.  \nIf I go UP, I move away from nearest apples but maybe toward (8,7) later.\n\nGiven I\u2019m behind by 2 apples (14 vs 16), I should try to secure (8,4) quickly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP: safe but delays apple.  \nDOWN: safe this turn but fewer future moves.  \nRIGHT: safe, good future moves, progresses toward (8,4).\n\nBest choice: RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (7,5), move to (8,5) then DOWN to (8,4) to grab apple. Watch enemy\u2019s movement \u2014 if they go UP to (4,4), they may also aim for (8,4) but I\u2019m closer. If they block, consider going UP toward (8,7) instead.

If I go DOWN, I eat it this turn.  \nEnemy at (6,4) is 2 steps from (8,4) via (7,4), but I\u2019m already there if I go DOWN.  \nSo DOWN secures apple immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \n\n**DOWN to (8,4)** (eat apple, grow by 1):  \nNext turn my body will be: head (8,4), then new tail segment added at end (so tail stays at (3,0) until move), but effectively length increases by 1 after eating.  \nFrom (8,4) next turn:  \nUP (8,5): my body at (8,5) after move? Wait, careful: after moving to (8,4), my old head (8,5) becomes first body segment. So (8,5) is occupied.  \nLEFT (7,4): empty.  \nRIGHT (9,4): empty.  \nDOWN (8,3): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**UP to (8,6)**:  \nNext turn from (8,6):  \nUP (8,7): apple, empty now.  \nDOWN (8,5): body (old head position) \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (7,6): empty.  \nRIGHT (9,6): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves.  \n\n**RIGHT to (9,5)**:  \nNext turn from (9,5):  \nUP (9,6): empty.  \nDOWN (9,4): empty.  \nLEFT (8,5): body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN) \u2014 worse.  \n\nSo RIGHT reduces future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Danger from enemy\u2019s move to (6,4)**  \nEnemy at (6,4) next turn could move to (7,4) or (6,5) or (5,4) or (6,3).  \nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), enemy could move to (7,4) next turn, blocking my LEFT from (8,4). But I still have RIGHT and DOWN from (8,4) next turn.  \nIf I go UP to (8,6), enemy is farther away, but I miss the apple.  \n\nGiven scores (me 14, enemy 16), securing (8,4) now is good.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan after eating (8,4)**  \nAfter eating (8,4), consider going for (8,7) next if safe, or (0,4) later. Avoid getting trapped by enemy\u2019s long body in lower/mid board.  \n\n---\n\n**Best move:** DOWN to eat apple now and keep good mobility.  \n\nDOWN",

Actually, let's check:  \nCurrent body given is: [(8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)] \u2014 length 15 body segments + head = total length 16. Yes.  \n\n**Enemy head:** (6,4) \u2014 moved RIGHT last turn as predicted.  \n**Enemy body:** length 17 (16 apples + 1 initial segment).  \n\n**Apples left:** (0,0), (0,4), (1,9), (8,7), (4,7).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safe moves from (8,4)**  \n- UP (8,5): my body segment \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (8,3): empty.  \n- LEFT (7,4): empty.  \n- RIGHT (9,4): empty.  \n\nSafe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (6,4)**  \nEnemy safe moves:  \nUP (6,5): my body at (6,5) \u2192 unsafe for enemy.  \nDOWN (6,3): enemy\u2019s own body at (6,3) \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (5,4): enemy\u2019s own body at (5,4) \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (7,4): empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (7,4).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn**  \nEnemy will be at (7,4) after moving.  \nMy possible destinations:  \n- DOWN (8,3): safe.  \n- LEFT (7,4): same cell as enemy\u2019s head this turn \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \n- RIGHT (9,4): safe.  \n\nSo LEFT is deadly. Remove LEFT from safe list.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nClosest apple to me:  \n- (8,7) is 3 steps away (UP twice then RIGHT? Actually from (8,4) to (8,7) is UP 3).  \n- (4,7) is 4 steps away.  \n- (0,4) is 8 steps away.  \n- (1,9) is far.  \n- (0,0) is far.  \n\nFrom (8,4), going DOWN or RIGHT doesn\u2019t directly approach the nearest apple (8,7).  \nBut going DOWN to (8,3) moves away from (8,7).  \nGoing RIGHT to (9,4) also doesn\u2019t help much.  \n\nBut maybe I can go DOWN to (8,3), then next turn go LEFT to (7,3) or RIGHT to (9,3) to eventually loop toward apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \n\n**DOWN to (8,3)**:  \nNext turn from (8,3):  \nUP (8,4): body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (8,2): empty.  \nLEFT (7,3): empty.  \nRIGHT (9,3): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**RIGHT to (9,4)**:  \nNext turn from (9,4):  \nUP (9,5): empty.  \nDOWN (9,3): empty.  \nLEFT (8,4): body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo DOWN gives better future mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s position after moving to (7,4)**  \nEnemy at (7,4) next turn could move to (8,4), (7,5), (6,4), (7,3).  \nIf I go DOWN to (8,3), enemy could move to (7,3) next turn, blocking my LEFT from (8,3). But I\u2019d still have DOWN and RIGHT from (8,3).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,4), enemy could move to (8,4) next turn, blocking my LEFT from (9,4) \u2014 but my LEFT from (9,4) is already blocked by my body anyway.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy is longer (17 vs my 16) and will likely try to get apples (4,7) or (8,7).  \nI need to survive and collect apples while avoiding being trapped.  \nFrom (8,3), I can go to (7,3) or (9,3) next turn, then work my way up toward (8,7) or (4,7).  \nGoing DOWN now avoids immediate danger and keeps options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Best move:** DOWN  \n\nDOWN",

That means enemy will die this turn unless I\u2019m mistaken about one of those cells being empty. Let\u2019s double-check:  \n(7, 3) enemy body \u2014 yes.  \n(7, 1) enemy body \u2014 yes, (7, 1) is not listed? Wait, enemy body listed ends at (7, 0). Did I miss (7, 1)? The board shows at y=1, x=7 is '.' in the diagram, so (7, 1) is empty. Let\u2019s verify: enemy body from last turn: [(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)] \u2014 yes, (7, 1) was in enemy body last turn. But after enemy moved from (7, 3) to (7, 2), the tail (7, 1) moved away? No \u2014 enemy length is 16 (apples 16), so body length 16 segments including head. Last turn head was (7, 3), body segments were 16 total. This turn head is (7, 2), so body shifts: new head (7, 2), then old head (7, 3) becomes body, tail (7, 1) is removed if no apple eaten. Enemy didn\u2019t eat apple last turn (no apple at (7, 2)), so length stays 16, tail (7, 1) disappears, new tail is the second-to-last from previous body? Let\u2019s reconstruct:  \n\nPrevious enemy body (from last turn\u2019s data): head (7, 3), body: [(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)] \u2014 that\u2019s 16 body segments after head? Wait, that list length is 16, plus head (7, 3) makes 17 total segments, but apples 16 means length = apples + 1 = 17, yes. So last turn enemy length 17. This turn, moves to (7, 2), no apple eaten, so new body: head (7, 2), then (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), \u2026, up to (7, 0) \u2014 but (7, 1) is gone. So enemy body now: [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0)].  \n\nThus from (7, 2):  \nUP (7, 3) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (7, 1) \u2192 empty (since tail moved off it).  \nLEFT (6, 2) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (8, 2) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is DOWN to (7, 1).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy will be at (7, 1) after moving.  \nMy possible destinations:  \n- UP (9, 3): safe.  \n- DOWN (9, 1): safe.  \n\nNo overlap.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 9), (8, 7), (4, 7).  \nClosest to me: (8, 7) is 5 steps away.  \nFrom (9, 2), UP moves toward (8, 7) (y increases). DOWN moves away.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \n\n**UP to (9, 3):**  \nNext turn from (9, 3):  \nUP (9, 4): empty.  \nDOWN (9, 2): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (8, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nOnly UP safe \u2192 1 safe move.  \n\n**DOWN to (9, 1):**  \nNext turn from (9, 1):  \nUP (9, 2): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (9, 0): empty.  \nLEFT (8, 1): empty.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo DOWN and LEFT safe \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nDOWN gives more options next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nIf enemy moves to (7, 1), then next turn enemy\u2019s only safe move from there? From (7, 1):  \nUP (7, 2) empty? No, (7, 2) will be empty after enemy leaves it.  \nDOWN (7, 0) enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (6, 1) enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (8, 1) empty.  \nSo enemy will have UP and RIGHT safe next turn.  \n\nI need to survive and get apples. My tail is at (1, 1), will move in 15 turns unless I eat. Right now, going DOWN to (9, 1) gives more options next turn and keeps me safe. Going UP to (9, 3) leads to a potential trap (only UP next turn, then possibly stuck).  \n\nBetter to go DOWN now, then maybe LEFT to (8, 1) next turn to start working toward center/apples while keeping options.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final choice**  \nDOWN is safe, gives more future mobility, avoids immediate danger.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (9, 1), consider moving LEFT to (8, 1) if safe, to start path toward apples (8, 7) via bottom/left side.  \n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s fatal. So LEFT is unsafe.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (9, 0), enemy goes to (8, 1) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nTherefore only truly safe move for me is DOWN.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after DOWN to (9, 0)**  \nFrom (9, 0):  \n- UP (9, 1): my body (next turn tail moves, but (9, 1) will be empty? Let\u2019s check: my tail is at (1, 2), will move to (1, 3) if I don\u2019t eat apple. So (9, 1) will be empty next turn). Actually careful: my body after moving DOWN: head (9, 0), then (9, 1) becomes body segment, so (9, 1) will be my body next turn. So UP next turn is unsafe.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (8, 0): empty.  \n- RIGHT: off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo next turn from (9, 0) only LEFT is safe. That\u2019s a dead-end path.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Alternative: can I make LEFT safe by predicting enemy\u2019s move?**  \nEnemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (8, 1). If I go LEFT to (8, 1), we collide. So LEFT is definitely fatal. So LEFT is out.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Is there any way to survive beyond next turn?**  \nIf I go DOWN to (9, 0), next turn only LEFT to (8, 0) is safe. From (8, 0):  \n- UP (8, 1): possibly enemy there next turn? Let\u2019s simulate:  \nTurn 82: enemy moves to (8, 1).  \nTurn 83: enemy from (8, 1): possible moves?  \nUP (8, 2): my body (my (8, 2) is still there unless tail moves? My tail is at (1, 2), will move to (1, 3) on turn 83 if no apple eaten. So (8, 2) remains my body. So enemy UP unsafe.  \nDOWN (8, 0): if I\u2019m at (8, 0) on turn 83, that\u2019s my head \u2192 collision if enemy goes DOWN? But enemy doesn\u2019t know my move; but if I go to (8, 0) on turn 83, enemy could go DOWN to (8, 0) too \u2192 collision. That\u2019s risky.  \nLEFT (7, 1): empty (enemy\u2019s old head cell, now empty).  \nRIGHT (9, 1): my body.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves from (8, 1) on turn 83: possibly LEFT to (7, 1) and maybe DOWN to (8, 0) if I\u2019m not there.  \n\nIf I go (8, 0) on turn 83, enemy might go DOWN to (8, 0) \u2192 collision. So maybe I should avoid (8, 0) if enemy might go there.  \n\nBut I have no choice: from (9, 0) on turn 83 only LEFT to (8, 0) is safe. So I\u2019ll be at (8, 0) on turn 83. Enemy could choose DOWN to (8, 0) if it seems safe to them (they don\u2019t see my future move). That\u2019s a risk.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Could I eat an apple to extend tail and change future?**  \nApples: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 9), (8, 7), (4, 7).  \nFrom (9, 1), apple (8, 7) is 7 steps away, others farther. No apple reachable in 1 move.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Check if enemy might die before moving**  \nEnemy has only one safe move (RIGHT to (8, 1)), so they will take it. They won\u2019t die this turn.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Conclusion**  \nOnly safe move now is DOWN to (9, 0). Even though it leads to a tight spot next turn, it keeps me alive this turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (9, 0), only LEFT to (8, 0) is safe. Hope enemy doesn\u2019t move DOWN to (8, 0) on turn 83. If enemy moves LEFT to (7, 1) instead, I survive. If enemy moves DOWN, we collide and both die. But I have no alternative now.  \n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s fatal.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 is there any alternative? I have only one possible move (LEFT), but it leads to certain death if enemy moves as predicted. Let\u2019s double-check enemy\u2019s safe moves again:  \n\nEnemy body: (7,1) is behind head, so LEFT to (7,1) is into own body \u2192 unsafe. UP (8,2) is my body segment \u2192 unsafe. RIGHT (9,1) is my body \u2192 unsafe. DOWN (8,0) is empty now. So yes, only DOWN is safe for enemy.  \n\nSo if I move LEFT, we collide at (8,0) and both die.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Is there any way to survive?**  \nIf all my possible moves lead to death, I must choose the only move available and hope enemy chooses differently? But enemy only has one safe move, so they will take it. This means I die this turn.  \n\nBut let\u2019s check rules: if I stay still? Not allowed \u2014 must move. So I\u2019m forced into collision.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Could I have missed something?**  \nCheck if enemy might have another safe move:  \nEnemy head at (8,1), body at (7,1), (7,2), etc.  \nLEFT (7,1) is body \u2192 unsafe.  \nUP (8,2) is my body (9,2) \u2192 wait, (8,2) is my body, yes.  \nRIGHT (9,1) is my body.  \nDOWN (8,0) is empty.  \n\nSo indeed only DOWN.  \n\nThus LEFT for me means head-on collision.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Conclusion**  \nI have no safe move. The only possible move is LEFT, which kills me.  \n\nSince I must choose a move, I\u2019ll choose LEFT and hope enemy does something else (but they won\u2019t).  \n\n**Plan for next turn (if alive):** Not applicable \u2014 likely dead.  \n\nLEFT",
