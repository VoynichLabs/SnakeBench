So enemy is longer now but still far away.\n\n**Possible moves from (8,2):**  \nUP: (8, 3) \u2014 empty, safe.  \nDOWN: (8, 1) \u2014 apple! Eating apple \u2192 grow to length 2, head moves to (8,1), new body segment at (8,2).  \nLEFT: (7, 2) \u2014 empty, safe.  \nRIGHT: (9, 2) \u2014 apple! Eating apple \u2192 grow to length 2, head moves to (9,2), new body segment at (8,2).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT give apples immediately.\n\n**Distance to apples after this move:**  \nIf I eat apple at (8,1) (DOWN), remaining apples: (9,2), (0,1), (0,9), (7,0). From (8,1), closest apple is (9,2) distance 2 or (7,0) distance 2.  \nIf I eat apple at (9,2) (RIGHT), remaining apples: (8,1), (0,1), (0,9), (7,0). From (9,2), closest apple is (8,1) distance 2 (down-left), but (9,2) is board edge \u2014 only moves from there will be UP, DOWN, LEFT (no RIGHT).  \n\nEating at (9,2) puts me on the edge, possibly limiting options. Eating at (8,1) leaves more directions open next turn.\n\n**Enemy consideration:** Enemy at (4,9) \u2014 far from me, no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Safety check**:  \nDOWN to (8,1): no snake body there \u2014 apple \u2014 safe.  \nRIGHT to (9,2): no snake body there \u2014 apple \u2014 safe.  \n\n**Future safety**:  \nAfter eating (9,2), next turn from (9,2) may be riskier if in corner later, but not dangerous yet.  \nEating (8,1) then next turn can go to (9,1) then (9,2) possibly, or to (7,1), etc.\n\n**Better move:**  \nEating DOWN to (8,1) seems slightly better because it keeps me away from edges, more central, and I can get (9,2) next if possible.\n\nBut need to check \u2014 if enemy is not a threat, maybe immediate apple grab closest is fine with either. But I should maybe prioritize maximizing sequence of apples:  \nFrom (8,2): DOWN to (8,1) \u2192 next turn RIGHT to (9,2) could get two apples in two moves.  \nFrom (8,2): RIGHT to (9,2) \u2192 next turn DOWN to (9,1) no apple, LEFT to (8,2) is my new body, so only UP from (9,2) is safe next turn \u2014 that might trap slightly.  \n\nThus DOWN is better for future movement.\n\nI choose **DOWN** to eat (8,1), grow, and keep options open.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:** From (8,1), consider heading to (9,2) if still available, or toward (7,0). Watch enemy movement as it grows. Keep avoiding possible trap near edges.\n\nDOWN",

This is highly desirable.\n\n**Checking safety after eating:**\nIf I eat the apple, my new body will be: head (5,5), then old head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). Tail stays put, so body length increases by 1 but tail doesn\u2019t move this turn.\n\nThen next turn, from (5,5):\n- UP (5,6): empty.\n- DOWN (5,4): my old head \u2192 body segment \u2192 invalid.\n- LEFT (4,5): empty.\n- RIGHT (6,5): empty.\nSo after eating, I'd have 3 safe moves next turn. Good.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n## DOWN (5,3)\nMoves away from apples, but is safe. From (5,3): UP (5,4) old head \u2192 body segment \u2192 invalid; DOWN (5,2) empty; LEFT (4,3) body segment \u2192 invalid; RIGHT (6,3) empty \u2192 so only 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**RIGHT (6,4)**\nFrom (6,4): UP (6,5) empty; DOWN (6,3) empty; LEFT (5,4) body segment (old head) \u2192 invalid; RIGHT (7,4) empty \u2192 3 safe moves. But I miss the chance to eat (5,5) this turn, and enemy could possibly move towards it in future (though not immediately).\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (1,1):**\nUP (1,2) empty; DOWN (1,0) empty; LEFT (0,1) body segment \u2192 invalid; RIGHT (2,1) empty.\nEnemy could go UP/DOWN/RIGHT. Enemy cannot reach (5,5) next turn, but might move generally towards center eventually. They have 5 apples to my 3, so growth is crucial.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is clearly best \u2014 eat the apple, grow, keep 3 safe moves next turn. Alternative safe moves don't give the same benefit.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (5,5), assess path to other apples \u2014 maybe (7,1) or (9,8), but avoid enemy's territory near (0,0) side. Keep an eye on enemy's length advantage.\n\nUP",

I didn\u2019t eat apple this turn (no apple at (7,1)), so my body just moves forward: head to (8,1), body becomes [(7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5)] \u2014 so (7,1) becomes my body segment.  \n\nSo if enemy goes UP to (7,1) after I leave, enemy hits my body and dies. So enemy won\u2019t choose UP likely. Enemy\u2019s safe moves:  \nLEFT (6,0) body segment \u2192 invalid; RIGHT (8,0) apple \u2192 safe; DOWN invalid. So enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (8,0).  \n\nSo enemy will go to (8,0) and eat apple, growing to length 7.  \n\n**My plan:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8,1), next to enemy\u2019s new head (8,0), that\u2019s risky for head-on collision next turn if I go DOWN. But I can avoid that next turn by going UP or RIGHT.  \n\nLEFT to (6,1) avoids enemy but fewer options next turn.  \n\nBetter to go RIGHT \u2014 more flexibility, closer to apples (8,3) and (9,8) later.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (8,1), next turn go UP to (8,2) to avoid potential collision with enemy at (8,0), then target (8,3) apple. Keep distance from enemy head since they\u2019re longer.  \n\nRIGHT  \n\n**FINAL MOVE**  \nRIGHT",

Moving UP keeps me along the right wall, which could become limiting.\n\n2. **LEFT to (8, 1)**: This moves me away from the wall and creates more breathing room. From (8, 1), I would have good access to the apples at (3, 6) and (1, 8), and potentially cut off the enemy's path. This also avoids immediate conflict with the enemy who is currently at (8, 3).\n\nThe enemy at (8, 3) can move UP to (8, 4), DOWN to (8, 2) (which is safe for them), LEFT to (7, 3) (safe), or RIGHT to (9, 3) (safe). If I move UP to (9, 2) and they move RIGHT to (9, 3), that could put us in a risky position.\n\nMoving LEFT to (8, 1) gives me more options next turn and avoids the right wall trap. This seems like the better strategic choice to maintain maneuverability.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move toward the center/left side to access the apples at (3, 6) while keeping the enemy at bay.\n\nLEFT",
