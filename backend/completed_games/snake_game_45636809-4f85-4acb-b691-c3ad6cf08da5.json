Let's break this down!\n\n**DEADLY MOVES TO ELIMINATE:**\n- **LEFT:** Would move to (0, 0) - that's the bottom-left corner! Safe for now but that's a TRAP! We'd be stuck with only 2 escape routes.\n- **DOWN:** Would move to (1, -1) - OFF THE BOARD! DEATH! \ud83d\udd25\n- **UP:** Moves to (1, 1) - Apple territory! This cell currently has an apple AND the opponent's head is at (5,3), not near us.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves to (2, 0) - Safe, but moving AWAY from the apple cluster.\n\n**ANALYSIS:** \nThe opponent is at (5,3) with an apple right next to them at (4,3) - they're probably going for that! We have apples at (0,6), (1,0) is our current spot, (0,9), (3,4), (4,4), (5,1), (6,1) and more! The (1,1) spot has an apple dropping RIGHT NOW!\n\n**STRATEGY:** \nGoing **UP** to (1,1) gives us our first apple, grows us to size 1, and opens up multiple paths for the next turn. We'll have access to (0,1), (2,1), (1,2), or (1,0) (backwards, but that's only if we get trapped later). This is the PLAY! We need that growth to start boxing them out!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nGrab this apple, grow to size 1, then work our way toward the center to cut off the opponent's access to the apples at (3,4), (4,4). We want to trap them in their corner while we dominate the board!\n\n**CHAT ARE YOU READY?! LET'S GOOOO!!!** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

No bodies to worry about right now.\n- Turn 0 \u2014 both apples 0. If we force a head-on with equal score we can both die and that\u2019s a draw \u2014 we DON\u2019T want that. Play smart, play hungry.\n\nDecision process (thinking out loud like the chat wants):\n1) Consider all four moves from (5,3):\n   - UP -> (5,4): on-board, not an apple. Keeps max flexibility (can go back down next turn since we won\u2019t grow). Good central control.\n   - DOWN -> (5,2): apple at (5,2). Eats and grows (length 2). Aggressive but reduces immediate maneuverability (can\u2019t go back into (5,3) next turn).\n   - LEFT -> (4,3): apple at (4,3). Same growth tradeoff, moves left toward center.\n   - RIGHT -> (6,3): apple at (6,3). Also an apple; moves right and grows.\n\n2) Eliminate instant-death moves:\n   - None of the four moves would immediately kill us (all are on-board and no bodies are occupying those squares). Opponent at (1,0) is too far to cause a head-on this turn. So all four are safe right now.\n\n3) Among the safe moves, prefer ones that keep options open and avoid risky head-ons:\n   - Eating an apple now (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) gives an early growth advantage, but it also reduces our immediate freedom (your previous head square becomes your body when you grow).\n   - Staying flexible (UP) keeps multiple follow-up moves available and lets us react to the opponent as they start moving. We can still pivot to apples next turn and avoid committing to a corridor too early.\n\nTactical call (short-term + long-term plan):\n- Short-term: Take UP to (5,4). Why? It keeps our options open, avoids prematurely boxing ourselves in by growing, and positions us centrally to react to the rival\u2019s approach. We want to control space and only force a head-on when we have a clear apples/score advantage.\n- Long-term plan: Move toward center and monitor the opponent\u2019s axis. If they try to hug the left/bottom edges, snowball apples on the open side to grow longer and then cut off escape routes. Force them into a shrinking pocket; only initiate head-on if our apple count is strictly higher. Maintain flexibility until we can reliably corral them.\n\nAlright chat, we\u2019re playing it smart and aggressive from a position of control \u2014 get hyped? \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

This is the left edge! Only 2 escape routes (DOWN to (0,0), UP to (0,2), RIGHT back to (1,1)). Also potentially trap-like.\n\n**ELIMINATION:** DOWN and LEFT both put us on edges with fewer future options. We need to stay flexible to dominate the board!\n\n**CHOICE:** Between UP and RIGHT - both keep us central with multiple escape routes.

Opponent snake #0 is at (5, 3) with body length 0. Apples are scattered everywhere.\n\n**ANALYZING MY MOVES FROM (2, 1):**\n1. **UP to (2, 2)**: Currently empty (no apples, no snakes). Safe move. Opens up paths to (2, 3), (1, 2), (3, 2). Central position with multiple escape routes.\n2. **DOWN to (2, 0)**: Currently empty. BUT this is the bottom edge! Only 3 escape routes (LEFT to (1, 0), RIGHT to (3, 0), UP back to (2, 1)). Risky long-term.\n3. **LEFT to (1, 1)**: Currently empty. Moving back to where I just was. Actually, my last move was RIGHT from (1,1) to (2,1), so moving LEFT would be going backwards into my own previous position. Is this considered hitting myself? **WAIT!** My body is empty (length 0), so there's no body segment at (1,1) right now. The rules say \"moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself.\" But my body is empty, so (1,1) is currently empty. However, moving back to my previous position might be strategically weak but NOT fatal. Let me reconsider: The rule says \"into the cell behind your head\" - that would be (1,1). Since my body is empty, that cell is clear. So LEFT is technically safe but returns to previous position.\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 1)**: Currently empty. Safe. Opens paths to (4,1), (3,2), (3,0), (2,1). Good central position.\n\n**ELIMINATION:**\n- DOWN goes to edge - eliminate for now.\n- LEFT goes back to previous position - strategically weak but not fatal. I'll keep it as option but prefer forward movement.\n- UP and RIGHT both keep me central with multiple escape routes.\n\n**STRATEGY CONSIDERATION:**\nLooking at apples: There's an apple at (5, 2) and (4, 3) that are relatively close. My opponent is at (5, 3) - very close to these apples! I need to either:\n1. Move to cut off his access to these apples\n2. Move toward other apples while keeping options open\n\nFrom (2,1), moving RIGHT to (3,1) gets me closer to the apple at (4,3) and (5,2), and positions me between the opponent and the apple cluster. Moving UP to (2,2) is more central but might allow opponent to grab (4,3) first.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get aggressive! The opponent is at (5,3) with an apple at (5,2) directly below him and (4,3) to his left. If he moves DOWN or LEFT, he'll grab an apple and grow, giving him momentum. I need to position myself to either steal those apples or cut off his escape routes. Moving RIGHT to (3,1) puts me on a trajectory to intercept him or claim territory.\n\n**CHOICE:** RIGHT to (3,1) - it's forward progress toward the action, keeps me central, and positions me better to challenge for apples or cut off the opponent's expansion.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

No bodies. Apples nearby: (4,3), (6,3), (5,2) are all right next to us \u2014 instant content if we commit. We\u2019re turn 2, be bold.\n\nConsider all four directions from (5,3):\n- UP -> (5,4): totally safe, keeps max flexibility (no growth), holds center.\n- DOWN -> (5,2): apple! Immediate +1 point, tail will occupy (5,3) next turn (we\u2019ll have a small body).\n- LEFT -> (4,3): apple as well, also gives growth but puts us one left.\n- RIGHT -> (6,3): apple too, one right.\n\nEliminate instant-death: none of these moves would immediately kill us \u2014 board bounds clear and opponent is far. But tactical elimination: avoid a head-on when scores are tied. If we can pick up an apple now, we get the lead (1 vs 0) and can be much more willing to force collisions later.\n\nTactical call (short-term): Take the DOWN apple to (5,2). Why? It gives us the immediate apples lead, pushes us lower (closer to the enemy\u2019s row) so we can start hemming them in, and it still leaves three safe follow-ups (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) next turn \u2014 enough flexibility to trap or trade when we want. Getting that early +1 turns head-on into a weapon instead of a mutual-suicide risk. Aggro mode: yes please. \ud83d\ude08\n\nLong-term plan (next few turns): After snagging (5,2), pivot left toward the opponent\u2019s quadrant to shrink their space. Force them toward the bottom-left corner and only commit to a head-on once we have the score advantage and a safe escape route. Keep apples as bait \u2014 grow selectively to maintain mobility and then close the net.\n\nDOWN",

We're live and looking to dominate this snake battle! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break down this move.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\nMy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 1) with no body segments. Opponent (ID 0) is at (5, 2) with one body segment at (5, 3) and 1 apple. Score is 1-0 in their favor. We need to make up ground!\n\n**ANALYZING MY MOVES FROM (3, 1):**\n1. **UP to (3, 2)**: Currently empty (board shows '.' at (3,2)). Safe. Opens paths to (3,3), (2,2), (4,2). Central position with good options.\n2. **DOWN to (3, 0)**: Currently empty. Edge move - only 3 escape routes. Risky for long-term play.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 1)**: Currently empty. My previous position, but since I have no body, it's safe. However, this retreats from the action.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 1)**: Currently empty. BUT there's an apple at (4,3) nearby, and this gets me closer to the apple cluster near the opponent. However, opponent is at (5,2) - if they move LEFT, they could be heading for that same apple at (4,3) or maybe the one at (5,2) itself... Wait, (5,2) is their HEAD position. There's no apple on their head. The apple is at (7,2) according to the apple list, not (5,2). Let me check the board: row 2 shows \"...0.\" which means opponent at (5,2). No apple there. But (4,3) on the board is \"A A\" - two apples! Actually looking at the board state: row 3 ends with \"T A .\" where T is tail at (6,3) and A is apple at (7,3)? No, let me read carefully.\n\nActually looking at the apple drops list: (4,3) is an apple. On the board, row 3 shows \"... . A T A . .\" Let me count columns 0-9. Row 3: columns 0-3 are empty, col4 is A, col5 is T (opponent tail), col6 is A, rest empty. So apple at (4,3) and (6,3)? But (6,3) shows as A in row3, and opponent tail is at (5,3) according to the opponent data... Confusing. Let me trust the apple list which says (4,3) is an apple.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- Opponent is at (5,2) with tail at (5,3). They have 1 apple already. They're positioned to potentially grab nearby apples.\n- My position (3,1) has apples at (4,3) (north-east) and (3,6) (north). Also (4,4) and others.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,1) puts me at (4,1) which is very close to (4,3) apple. But opponent at (5,2) could also reach that apple by moving LEFT or UP.\n- Moving UP to (3,2) is safer and keeps me central, giving me options to go for apples at (3,6), (4,4), or (4,3) on subsequent turns.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nWe need to score! Opponent already has 1 point. I'm at 0. We can't let them run away with it. I should head toward the apple cluster in the upper right but avoid direct confrontation with opponent for now since we're both length 1. If I can get to an apple before them, I'll grow and can then start aggressive positioning.\n\n**CHOICE:** UP to (3,2). This keeps me away from the edge, gives me multiple escape routes, and positions me to pursue apples at (3,6), (4,4), or (4,3) while watching the opponent's move next turn.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** UP",

DEAD. Cut it.\n- DOWN -> (5,1) has an apple. Safe, +1 apple (we go to 2). Growth gives us more board control and lets us start hemming them in vertically.\n- LEFT -> (4,2) safe, moves toward enemy horizontally and could grab (4,3) next turn, but it forgoes the immediate apple.\n- RIGHT -> (6,2) safe but drifts away from the fight.\n\nTactical read: we already lead 1\u20130. Grabbing (5,1) makes it 2\u20130 and lets us legitimately force a head-on later (double KO would hand us the win). Eating also gives us an extra segment to start boxing. DOWN keeps 3 follow-up options (L/R/D after growth) and moves us closer to the opponent\u2019s row.\n\nShort-term plan (for the replay next turn): snag (5,1) now, then pivot LEFT to pressure the rival into the bottom-left quadrant. If they try to escape, chase; if they commit to a head-on, we\u2019re up enough to punish it.\n\nDOWN",

That's an apple opportunity! But need to check safety.\n2. **DOWN to (3, 1)**: Currently empty. Would retreat from the action.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 2)**: Currently empty.

(3,3) is RIGHT THERE - one move away!\n- If I go UP to (3,3), I grow, get +1 point, and extend my reach.\n- The opponent might go for apples too - they're at (5,1) near (4,3) apple, but that's 2 moves away for them.\n- Going UP keeps me central and gives me more options after growing.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGet that apple at (3,3) to start climbing back!

No way.\n- DOWN -> (5,0) is safe but moves away from the fight and reduces immediate turning options (will block UP next turn).\n- RIGHT -> (6,1) eats an apple (nice), but drifts AWAY from the rival and gives them room to roam.\n- LEFT -> (4,1) is safe and pushes directly toward Snake #1 at (3,2). This maximizes pressure and keeps options open to pivot up or down next turn to hem them in.\n\nTactical pick: LEFT. Why? We\u2019re up 2\u20130 \u2014 time to close the net. Moving left brings us closer to the rival\u2019s row and forces them to choose between fleeing into tight space or contesting apples near (3,3)/(4,3). From (4,1) we can threaten (3,1) or (4,2) next turn, which sets up potential head-to-head pressure while still keeping lateral escape routes. We avoid the backwards death and we don\u2019t waste tempo running away to grab an apple.\n\nShort-term plan (for the clip next turn): move LEFT now to apply direct pressure. If they try to run up, cut them off by pushing UP next turn and box them against the top apples; if they try to flee down/left, chase and force a risky head-on where we\u2019re favored with the higher score.

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're on turn 5, and the scoreboard shows us trailing 1-2! Snake #0 has 2 apples already and they're positioned at (4,1) with body at (5,1) and (5,2). My snake (ID 1) is at (3,3) after that clutch UP move last turn that grabbed the apple! Let's see the board state...\n\nFirst, I need to check if I'm actually at (3,3) or if the board is showing my head at (3,3) with body at (3,2). According to the board state:\n- Row 3: `. . . 1 A . A . . .` - so at y=3, x=3 is \"1\" (my head)\n- Row 2: `. . . T . T . A . .` - at y=2, x=3 is \"T\" (my tail), and at x=5 is \"T\" (enemy tail)\n\nWait, looking closer at the board:\n- (3,3) shows \"1\" - that's my head\n- (3,2) shows \"T\" - that's my tail\n- So my snake is: Head (3,3), Body [(3,2)] - length 2\n- Enemy: Head (4,1), Body [(5,1), (5,2)] - length 3\n\nLet me verify the apple list to understand what's on the board:\n- (0,8), (7,2), (4,3), (6,3), (6,5), (3,6), (9,4), (0,6), (3,4), (6,1), (4,4), (0,9), (7,9), (8,7), (3,8)\n\nLooking at the board, I can see:\n- (3,3) shows \"1\" - but wait, that's my head, not an apple\n- (4,3) shows \"A\" - that's an apple at (4,3)\n- (6,3) shows \"A\" - that's an apple at (6,3)\n- (3,4) shows \"A\" - that's an apple at (3,4) - THIS IS ABOVE ME!\n\nSo I have an apple directly above me at (3,4)! Perfect opportunity.\n\nNow let's plan my move. I'm at (3,3). Possible moves:\n1. **UP to (3,4)**: There's an apple! This would grow me to length 3 and give me +1 point, tying the score at 2-2.\n2. **DOWN to (3,2)**: That's currently my tail's position. But wait, when I move, my tail moves too. Since my body is [(3,2)], when I move away from (3,3), my tail will move to where my head was? No, that's wrong. The snake moves forward: head moves to new position, tail follows the body. Actually, let me think about this... When a snake moves, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail moves from its current position (unless the snake grew this turn). So moving DOWN to (3,2) would be moving into my current tail position. But since the tail will move, it's not necessarily a collision... Actually, looking at the rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" And \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3,2), that's where my tail currently is. But the tail will move away as the snake moves, so this might be safe. However, the rule says \"into your own body\" - and (3,2) is part of my body. So moving there would be illegal. But wait, in snake games, you can move into your tail's cell because the tail moves forward. Let me check the rules again... The rule says \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself.\" The cell behind my head (3,3) is (3,2), which is my tail. So that would be \"directly backwards\". So this move is illegal.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2,3)**: Currently empty. Need to check safety.\n4. **RIGHT to (4,3)**: That's an apple! But wait, (4,3) has an apple according to the board. However, I need to check if it's safe. Snake #0 is at (4,1) - they might move UP to (4,2) or (4,3). But they're at (4,1) now, and their body is at (5,1) and (5,2). So they could move UP to (4,2) or (5,2) is behind them, or LEFT to (3,1), etc. They might go for the apple at (4,3) or (6,3). Actually, they're at (4,1) with y=1. The apple at (4,3) is at y=3, two steps away. They can't reach it in one move. Similarly, apple at (6,3) is also two steps away. So (4,3) is safe from the enemy head reaching it this turn.\n\nWait, but I need to check the board again. Looking at row 4: `. . . A A . . . . A`\nAt y=4, x=3 is \"A\" and x=4 is \"A\". So apples at (3,4) and (4,4). But earlier I thought (4,3) was an apple. Let me re-read the board carefully:\n\nRow 3 (y=3): `. . . 1 A . A . . .` - This means at y=3:\n- x=0: .\n- x=1: .\n- x=2: .\n- x=3: 1 (my head)\n- x=4: A (apple)\n- x=5: .\n- x=6: A (apple)\n- x=7: .\n- x=8: .\n- x=9: .\n\nSo apples at (4,3) and (6,3) on row 3.\n\nRow 4 (y=4): `. . . A A . . . . A`\n- x=0: .\n- x=1: .\n- x=2: .\n- x=3: A (apple)\n- x=4: A (apple)\n- x=5: .\n- x=6: .\n- x=7: .\n- x=8: .\n- x=9: A (apple)\n\nSo apples at (3,4), (4,4), and (9,4) on row 4.\n\nI'm at (3,3). So directly above me at (3,4) there's an apple!\n\nLet me consider all moves from (3,3):\n1. **UP to (3,4)**: Apple! This grows me to length 3, scores +1 point (2-2 tie), and positions me well. Need to check safety.\n2. **DOWN to (3,2)**: This is my current tail position. Moving here would be \"directly backwards\" - illegal per rules. Eliminated.\n3. **LEFT to (2,3)**: Empty. Safe from board perspective. Need to check if enemy could be there.\n4. **RIGHT to (4,3)**: Apple! This would also grow me to length 3. But (4,3) is an apple, and it's adjacent to the enemy's potential path.\n\nEnemy analysis: Snake #0 at (4,1) with body at (5,1) and (5,2). They have 2 apples.\nPossible moves for enemy:\n- UP to (4,2) - empty? Let's check board: Row 2 (y=2): `. . . T . T . A . .` - at x=4, y=2 is \".\" (empty), at x=5, y=2 is \"T\" (their tail)\n- UP to (5,2) - but that's their tail, illegal\n- LEFT to (3,1) - empty? Row 1 (y=1): `. . . . 0 T A . . .` - at x=3, y=1 is \".\" (empty)\n- RIGHT to (5,1) - that's their body, illegal\n- DOWN to (4,0) - valid, but away from apples\n\nMost likely, enemy will go UP to (4,2) to get closer to apples at (4,3), (6,3), (3,4), etc. Or LEFT to (3,1) maybe.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,4), enemy might go UP to (4,2). No collision.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,3), enemy might go UP to (4,2). Then they'd be at (4,2), I'd be at (4,3). No collision this turn, but next turn they could move UP to (4,3) where I am, causing a head-on collision if I stay there.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,3), enemy might go UP to (4,2). Safe.\n\nNow, considering the rules: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" I have 1 apple, they have 2. I'm behind, so I should NOT force collision yet. I need to catch up first.\n\nBest strategy: Get that apple at (3,4) to tie the score! That's the most direct way to stay competitive.\n\nSafety check for UP to (3,4):\n- Not off board\n- Not into my own body (my body is at (3,2))\n- Not into enemy body (enemy bodies are at (5,1) and (5,2))\n- Not backwards (down would be backwards)\n- Apple there = growth!\n\nBut wait, I need to consider if the enemy could move into (3,4) on the same turn. Enemy is at (4,1). To reach (3,4), they'd need to move UP twice or UP+LEFT, impossible in one move. So (3,4) is safe from enemy head.\n\nWhat about enemy body moving into (3,4)? Their body follows their head. If they move UP to (4,2), their body will shift: new head (4,2), body becomes [(4,1), (5,1)] (assuming they grow or not). Actually, if they don't eat an apple, their tail (5,2) moves away. So (3,4) won't be hit by their body.\n\nSo UP to (3,4) seems safe and profitable!\n\nAlternative: RIGHT to (4,3) also gets an apple. But (4,3) is closer to the enemy. If I go to (4,3), enemy at (4,1) could go UP to (4,2) next turn, then UP to (4,3) where I am, causing collision. Since I have fewer apples (1 vs 2), if we collide, I lose. So (4,3) is riskier.\n\nLEFT to (2,3) is safe but doesn't get me an apple. I need to catch up, so I should prioritize apples while staying safe.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is UP to (3,4) to grab the apple, tie the score 2-2, and extend my body for better board control.\n\nLet me double-check the board state one more time to ensure (3,4) is indeed an apple... Yes, row 4 shows \"A\" at x=3 (which is column 3, y=4). And my current head is at (3,3). So moving UP takes me to (3,4) - perfect!\n\nFinal decision: UP for the apple and tie game!\n\nOne more consideration: My tail is at (3,2). When I move UP to (3,4), my body will become [(3,3), (3,2)], and I'll have grown by 1, so actually my body will be [(3,3), (3,2)] - same as before but with my old head position becoming part of my body. Wait no, when I grow, my tail stays. So new snake: Head (3,4), Body [(3,3), (3,2)]. Length 3.\n\nActually, let me think about growth mechanics: When you eat an apple, you grow by 1 segment, meaning your tail doesn't move that turn. So if I start at Head (3,3), Body [(3,2)], and I move UP to (3,4) eating an apple, I end up with Head (3,4), Body [(3,3), (3,2)] - yes, length 3.\n\nPerfect plan. Let's execute!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:** Grab the apple at (3,4) to tie the score 2-2. After growing to length 3, I'll have better board control and can start positioning to cut off the enemy's access to the apple cluster in the center. Keep an eye on their movement - they'll likely go for apples at (4,3) or (6,3). Play aggressively but don't force collisions while behind.\n\nUP",

If they flee left/up, we chase and hem them in. \ud83d\udc40\n\nTactical thinking (short plan for next few turns):\n- Move UP now to (4,2) to close vertical distance and retain escape lanes.

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're at turn 6 with a TIED SCORE at 2-2! I just grabbed that apple at (3,4) last turn - LET'S GOOOO! Now my snake is: Head (3,4), Body [(3,3), (3,2)] with 2 apples. Enemy #0 is at (4,2) with body [(4,1), (5,1)] and 2 apples. \n\nOkay, let's analyze the board state from turn 5 results:\n\nFrom the board display:\nRow 4: `. . . 1 A . . . . A` - I'm at (3,4) as \"1\", apple at (4,4)\nRow 3: `. . . T A . A . . .` - My tail at (3,3) is \"T\", apple at (4,3) and (6,3)\nRow 2: `. . . T 0 . . A . .` - Enemy head at (4,2) is \"0\", my other tail at (3,2) is \"T\", apple at (7,2)\n\nWait, looking at the board again - Row 3 shows \"A\" at x=4 which is (4,3), and Row 4 shows \"A\" at x=4 which is (4,4). So there are apples at (4,3) and (4,4)!\n\nNow, I'm at (3,4). My options:\n1. **UP to (3,5)**: Empty? Let's check - Row 5 (y=5) shows `. . . . . . A . . .` at x=3 is empty. Safe, but no apple immediately there. However, there's an apple at (6,5) on row 5.\n2. **DOWN to (3,3)**: That's my body! I would die. ELIMINATED.\n3. **LEFT to (2,4)**: Empty? Row 4 shows \". . . 1 A...\" so x=2 (column 2) at y=4 is empty. Safe, but no immediate apple.\n4. **RIGHT to (4,4)**: APPLE! Row 4 shows \"A\" at x=4 (4,4). This would be another growth and tie breaker!\n\nBUT WAIT! Enemy #0 is at (4,2). If I go RIGHT to (4,4) and they go UP to (4,3), that's not a collision (they're at (4,3), I'm at (4,4)). But if they go UP TWICE in one turn? No, that's impossible. They can only move one cell.\n\nHowever, (4,4) is two steps away from enemy at (4,2). They could move UP to (4,3) this turn, then next turn move UP to (4,4) where I would be if I stay there. That's dangerous!\n\nAlso, I need to consider: if I go to (4,4) and they go UP to (4,3), no collision. But if they go UP to (4,3) and I'm at (4,4), that's fine. However, what if they go UP to (4,3) and I also go RIGHT to (4,4)? No collision. But what if they go UP to (4,3) and I go RIGHT to (4,4) - actually, (4,3) and (4,4) are different cells, so safe.\n\nBut wait - there's also apple at (4,3)! Row 3 shows \"A\" at x=4. So there are two apples stacked vertically: (4,3) and (4,4).\n\nEnemy at (4,2) could easily grab (4,3) this turn! And if I go for (4,4), they might get (4,3). That's fine, we'd both grow.\n\nLet me think about this more strategically. I currently have 2 apples, they have 2. If I go RIGHT to (4,4):\n- I get +1 apple = 3 apples, I lead!\n- But I'm now adjacent to enemy who could be at (4,3) after their move\n- Next turn, if they move to (4,4) where I am, I die (I have fewer apples, so I lose in collision)\n\nAlternative: Go UP to (3,5)\n- No immediate apple\n- But I position myself better\n- There's an apple at (6,5) on row 5\n- I avoid getting too close to enemy\n\nAlternative: Go LEFT to (2,4)\n- No immediate apple\n- Moves me away from enemy\n- There's an apple at (0,4)? Not sure, need to check board\n\nLooking at Row 4: `. . . 1 A . . . . A` - so (0,4) is empty, (1,4) empty, (2,4) empty, (3,4) me, (4,4) apple, (5,4) empty, (6,4) empty, (7,4) empty, (8,4) empty, (9,4) apple.\n\nSo (2,4) is safe and empty.\n\nBut I should prioritize apples to win! The apple at (4,4) is RIGHT THERE. I can grab it and lead the score 3-2!\n\nLet's check safety thoroughly for RIGHT to (4,4):\n- Not off board\n- Not my body (my body is at (3,3) and (3,2))\n- Enemy body: (4,1), (5,1) - no\n- Enemy head could move to (4,3) or (3,2) or (5,2) or (4,1)... wait, (4,1) is their body, can't go there. They're at (4,2), body at (4,1) and (5,1). So possible moves: UP to (4,3), LEFT to (3,2), DOWN to (4,1) [illegal - body], RIGHT to (5,2) [illegal - body? Wait, (5,2) is not their body, their body is (4,1) and (5,1). So (5,2) is empty. They could go RIGHT to (5,2). Or UP to (4,3). Or LEFT to (3,2).\n- If they go UP to (4,3), I'm at (4,4) - safe\n- If they go LEFT to (3,2), I'm at (4,4) - safe\n- If they go RIGHT to (5,2), I'm at (4,4) - safe\n\nSo RIGHT to (4,4) is SAFE from immediate collision!\n\nWhat about the future? If I'm at (4,4) with body [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] and enemy is at say (4,3), then next turn they could move UP to (4,4) where I am. That's a problem! They'd have 3 apples (if they ate one), I'd have 3 apples - tie. If we collide with equal apples, we both die and it's a draw. That's risky.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Maybe I should go UP to (3,5) instead. That gives me more breathing room and I can go for the apple at (6,5) next. That's safer and still aggressive.\n\nBut wait, I want to be AGGRESSIVE and dominate! I have the opportunity to take the lead RIGHT NOW. And if I'm at (4,4) and they're at (4,3), and they have 2 apples vs my 3, if they collide into me, I WIN! Because I have more apples. The rule: \"If he crashes into you, he loses.\" So if they move into my body, they die. But if they move into my head... wait, no, heads colliding in same cell kills both.\n\nLet me think about collision scenarios:\n- If both heads move to same cell \u2192 both die\n- If one head moves into other's body \u2192 that head dies\n- If I'm at (4,4) and they're at (4,3), and next turn I move somewhere else and they move to (4,4), that's fine as long as I don't also move there\n- But if next turn I STAY at (4,4) and they move to (4,4), we collide \u2192 both die \u2192 tie if we have same apples, I win if I have more\n\nActually, I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the apples again. The apple at (4,4) is RIGHT THERE. I should take it! That's the point of the game!\n\nPlus, there's another apple at (4,3) right below it. If I go to (4,4) and they go to (4,3), we both eat apples! Perfect!\n\nLet me confirm coordinates: My head is at (3,4). RIGHT means +x \u2192 (4,4). That's correct.\n\nNow, long-term plan: After getting this apple (making me 3-2 ahead), I need to watch enemy movement. If they go to (4,3), that's fine - we're adjacent but not colliding. Next turn, I should move UP to (3,5) or somewhere to avoid them potentially chasing me. But actually, with more apples, I can play more aggressively!\n\nOne more check: Could there be any other danger? My body occupies (3,3) and (3,2). When I move to (4,4), my new body will be [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]. So (3,4) becomes my first body segment. That's fine.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3,5)? Not shown on board but might exist. Actually, let me check the apple list again from the initial prompt... but I shouldn't rely on memory. From the board display, row 5 shows `. . . . . . A . . .` which is (6,5) apple. So no apple at (3,5).\n\nAlright, I'm going for the apple at (4,4) to take the lead! CHAT, THIS IS THE PLAY!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:** Grab the apple at (4,4) to take a 3-2 lead! After this, I'll be at (4,4) with body extending left. Enemy likely goes for (4,3) or (6,3) or (7,2). I need to watch their move and then reposition to maintain my lead while keeping options open. With 3 apples, I can play more aggressively and potentially force collisions where I win due to higher score. Let's go!\n\nRIGHT",

Immediate death. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (3,2) is the opponent\u2019s body. Walking into that is an instant KO. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (5,2) is safe and gives room, but it skips the apple and is slightly less aggressive.\n- UP -> (4,3) is safe AND contains an apple (we snag +1 and GROW). Opponent at (3,4) cannot reach (4,3) this turn, so no head-on risk. \u2705\n\nDecision: TAKE THE APPLE \u2014 we want to grow to dominate space and keep pressure on them.

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 7 and the score is TIED at 3-3! We just grabbed that apple last turn to level up, and now we're at (4,4). The enemy is at (4,3) with body [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]. \n\nOkay, let's break this down. I'm at (4,4), head pointing RIGHT? No, I moved RIGHT last turn to get here, so my previous head was at (3,4). My body now is [(4,4)? Wait, no. Let's track this carefully.\n\nLAST TURN: I was at (3,4). I moved RIGHT to (4,4). So NOW:\n- My head: (4,4)\n- My body: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] (the old head and the rest)\n\nENEMY LAST TURN: They were at (4,2). Looking at the current board state provided, their head is at (4,3). So they moved UP from (4,2) to (4,3). Their body is now [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1)].\n\nAPPLES: The apple at (4,4) was eaten by me (I grew). The apple at (4,3) was eaten by them (they grew). So now we're both at 3 apples.\n\nCURRENT STATE CHECK:\n- Me: Head (4,4), Body [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)], Apples: 3\n- Enemy: Head (4,3), Body [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1)], Apples: 3\n\nBOARD STATE ANALYSIS:\nLooking at the board display:\nRow 4: `. . . T 1 . . . . A` - Wait, this shows \"1\" at x=3? That's (3,4). But I'm at (4,4). Hmm, the board might not be perfectly updated or I'm misreading. Let me trust the data given.\n\nActually, looking at the board more carefully:\nRow 4: `. . . T 1 . . . . A` - This shows a \"1\" at x=3, y=4. That's (3,4). And an \"A\" at x=9, y=4. But I'm supposed to be at (4,4). There's a discrepancy.\n\nLet me re-read the state: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (4,4), Body: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\"\n\nSo my head IS at (4,4). The board display might be simplified. Let me focus on the coordinates given.\n\nENEMY HEAD: (4,3) - directly below me.\nENEMY BODY: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nMY BODY: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nNow, what are my options?\n\n**UP to (4,5):** \n- Is it safe? Check board - Row 5 (y=5): `. . . . . . A . . .` - so (4,5) is empty. \n- Not my body: my body is at x=3, so (4,5) is clear.\n- Not enemy body: enemy body is at (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). (4,5) is clear.\n- SAFE move.\n\n**DOWN to (4,3):**\n- This is where the ENEMY HEAD is! If I move DOWN and they move... wait, they're at (4,3) RIGHT NOW. If I move to (4,3), I'm moving into their head. That's a head-on collision if they stay or move into me. But we move simultaneously. If they move somewhere else and I move to (4,3), I'd be moving into an empty cell (since they left). But if they stay at (4,3) or move to (4,4), we collide.\n- Actually, if I move DOWN to (4,3) and they move UP to (4,4), we collide head-on in different cells? No, we swap positions. No collision because we're not in the same cell.\n- Wait, the rule: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" If I go DOWN to (4,3) and they go UP to (4,4), we're in different cells. Safe.\n- But what if they go UP to (4,4) and I go DOWN to (4,3)? No collision.\n- However, what if they go UP to (4,4) and I go DOWN to (4,3) - we're swapping positions. That's allowed.\n- But what if they go DOWN to (4,2)? That's their body! They can't go into their own body. They would die.\n- What if they go LEFT to (3,3)? That's MY BODY! (3,3) is part of my body. If they go LEFT into my body, they die!\n- What if they go RIGHT to (5,3)? Empty? Probably.\n\nSo if I go DOWN to (4,3):\n- If enemy goes UP to (4,4): We swap, no collision.\n- If enemy goes DOWN to (4,2): They die (into their own body).\n- If enemy goes LEFT to (3,3): They die (into my body).\n- If enemy goes RIGHT to (5,3): They live, we're at (4,3) and (5,3).\n\nThis is INTERESTING! If I go DOWN, I'm putting them in a dangerous spot. They might die or be forced to move into my body!\n\nBut wait, is (4,3) empty? No, the enemy HEAD is there. But since we move simultaneously, the cell is \"occupied\" by their head, but if I move there and they move away, I take it. The key is: if both heads try to occupy the same cell, we both die. If I move into a cell they're leaving, I survive.\n\nSo DOWN to (4,3) is potentially safe depending on their move. But I don't know their move. This is risky.\n\n**LEFT to (3,4):**\n- This is my BODY! (3,4) is my first body segment. I would be moving directly into my own body. That's DEATH. ELIMINATED.\n- Cannot go LEFT.\n\n**RIGHT to (5,4):**\n- Check board: Row 4 shows `. . . T 1 . . . . A` - so (5,4) should be empty (x=5 at y=4).\n- Not my body: my body is at x=3.\n- Not enemy body: enemy body is at (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). (5,4) is clear.\n- SAFE move.\n\nSo my safe moves are: UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3), RIGHT (5,4).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP to (4,5):** Safe, empty. Moves me away from enemy. Positions me for apple at (6,5) next turn. Keeps options open. No immediate apple.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4,3):** Currently occupied by enemy head. Risky but potentially rewarding. If enemy moves UP to (4,4), we swap - no collision. If enemy moves into my body, they die and I win! But if enemy moves to (4,4) and I move to (4,3), and then next turn they move back down... hmm. This is a mind game.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (5,4):** Safe, empty. Moves me horizontally away. There's an apple at (6,1) but that's far. No immediate apple.\n\nWAIT! I need to check the board again. The current board shows:\nRow 4: `. . . T 1 . . . . A`\nRow 3: `. . . T 0 . A . . .`\nRow 2: `. . . T T . A A . .`\n\nBut according to the data, MY head is at (4,4) and ENEMY head is at (4,3). The board shows \"1\" at (3,4) and \"0\" at (4,3). So the board might be showing positions from the start of the turn or something. I should trust the explicit coordinates.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's perspective. They're at (4,3) with 3 apples. I'm at (4,4) with 3 apples. They want to survive and grow. Where can they go?\n\nENEMY AT (4,3):\n- UP to (4,4): Where I am currently! If they go UP and I stay or go UP, we collide. If I go DOWN to (4,3), we swap.\n- DOWN to (4,2): That's their body! They die.\n- LEFT to (3,3): That's MY BODY! (3,3) is my body. They die.\n- RIGHT to (5,3): Empty? Probably safe.\n\nSo their best moves are UP to (4,4) or RIGHT to (5,3). DOWN and LEFT are death.\n\nIf they go UP to (4,4) and I go DOWN to (4,3), we swap. Safe.\nIf they go UP to (4,4) and I go UP to (4,5), we don't collide. Safe.\nIf they go UP to (4,4) and I go RIGHT to (5,4), we don't collide. Safe.\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (5,3) and I go DOWN to (4,3), no collision.\nIf they go RIGHT to (5,3) and I go UP to (4,5), no collision.\nIf they go RIGHT to (5,3) and I go RIGHT to (5,4), no collision.\n\nSo all my safe moves are... safe regardless of their move? Not quite.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3):\n- If they go UP to (4,4): We swap, both survive.\n- If they go RIGHT to (5,3): I go to (4,3), they go to (5,3). Both survive.\n\nIf I go UP to (4,5):\n- If they go UP to (4,4): They're at (4,4), I'm at (4,5). Safe.\n- If they go RIGHT to (5,3): They're at (5,3), I'm at (4,5). Safe.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4):\n- If they go UP to (4,4): They're at (4,4), I'm at (5,4). Safe.\n- If they go RIGHT to (5,3): They're at (5,3), I'm at (5,4). Safe.\n\nAll seem safe from immediate collision. But I need to think ahead.\n\nSTRATEGIC GOAL: Force a collision where I win due to equal or higher apples, or trap them.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3), I'm moving into the \"danger zone\" but potentially forcing them to make a bad move. If they go UP to (4,4), we're adjacent. Next turn, I could move UP to (4,4) if it's safe? But they'd be there. That would be collision.\n\nActually, if I go DOWN to (4,3) and they go UP to (4,4), we're at:\n- Me: (4,3)\n- Them: (4,4)\n\nNext turn, if I go UP to (4,4), they could move away or we collide. If we both have 3 apples, collision = both die = draw. Not ideal.\n\nIf I go UP to (4,5), I'm putting distance between us. I can go for the apple at (6,5) next. That seems safer and more strategic.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,4)? Wait, I'm already at (4,4). RIGHT would be (5,4). That's moving away too.\n\nLet me think about apple positioning. Looking at the apple list and board:\n- Apple at (6,5) - that's my target if I go UP\n- Apple at (6,6) - near that\n- Apple at (6,8) - further up\n- Apple at (0,6), (0,8), (0,9) - left side\n- Apple at (7,9), (8,7), (7,2), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) - scattered\n\nEnemy is at (4,3). They might go for (6,3) or (7,2) or (5,3).\n\nIf I go UP to (4,5), I'm heading toward the cluster at (6,5), (6,6), (6,8). That's good territory.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), I'm heading toward (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) area. Also good.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3), I'm engaging directly with enemy position. High risk, high reward.\n\nCHAT, WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE! We're tied at 3-3. We need to take control!\n\nBut going DOWN is a mind game. If they predict I'll go DOWN and they go RIGHT, I'm at (4,3) and they're at (5,3). Then next turn, they could chase me or I could chase them.\n\nIf they go UP to (4,4) and I go DOWN to (4,3), we're adjacent. That's a standoff.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the board. The current board shows \"1\" at (3,4). But the data says my head is at (4,4). Maybe the board is showing the state BEFORE the move? Or maybe it's showing my body? No, \"1\" should be head.\n\nI think there's confusion. Let me look at the board display again:\n\n```\n9 A . . . . . . A . .\n8 A . . A . . A . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . A .\n6 A . . A . .

A`\n- x=0: .\n- x=1: .\n- x=2: .\n- x=3: T (my tail at (3,4)?)\n- x=4: 1 (my head at (4,4)?)\n- x=5: .\n- x=6: .\n- x=7: .\n- x=8: .\n- x=9: A (apple at (9,4))\n\nThis matches! My head is at (4,4) (the \"1\"), and my tail is at (3,4) (the \"T\"). Perfect.\n\nRow 3: `. . . T 0 . A . . .`\n- x=3: T (my tail at (3,3)?)\n- x=4: 0 (enemy head at (4,3)?)\n- x=6: A (apple at (6,3))\n\nThis also matches! Enemy head at (4,3) as \"0\".\n\nSo the board is accurate. My head is at (4,4), enemy head at (4,3).\n\nNow, back to decision. \n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3), I'm moving to where the enemy currently is. If they go UP to (4,4), we swap. If they go RIGHT to (5,3), we end up adjacent: me at (4,3), them at (5,3).\n\nIf I go UP to (4,5), I'm moving away. If they go UP to (4,4), we're adjacent vertically. If they go RIGHT to (5,3), we're not adjacent.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), I'm moving away. If they go UP to (4,4), we're at (5,4) and (4,4) - adjacent diagonally. If they go RIGHT to (5,3), we're at (5,4) and (5,3) - adjacent vertically.\n\nAll options seem viable. But let's think about future apples.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is reachable if I go UP now and then RIGHT/UP later. The apple at (6,3) is reachable if I go RIGHT now.\n\nBut there's something more strategic: By going DOWN to (4,3), I'm directly challenging the enemy. If they go UP, we swap and I'm now \"below\" them. If they go RIGHT, I'm in their previous spot and they're to my right.\n\nActually, wait. If I go DOWN to (4,3) and they go UP to (4,4), we swap. Then next turn, I'm at (4,3) and they're at (4,4). From there, if I go UP to (4,4), that's their head. Collision! But if we both have 3 apples, we both die. Not good.\n\nIf I go DOWN and they go RIGHT, I'm at (4,3) and they're at (5,3). Next turn, I could go RIGHT to (5,3) but that's their head - collision. Or I could go UP to (4,4) which is empty (since they left). That seems better.\n\nHmm, I'm overthinking. Let me consider the simplest aggressive play.\n\nI have 3 apples. They have 3 apples. We're tied. I want to take the lead. \n\nWhere are the apples?\n- (6,5) - UP direction\n- (6,3) - RIGHT direction  \n- (6,6) - UP direction\n- (6,8) - UP direction\n- (6,2) - RIGHT direction\n- (6,1) - RIGHT direction\n- (7,2) - RIGHT direction\n- (7,9) - UP and RIGHT\n- (8,7) - UP and RIGHT\n- (9,4) - RIGHT direction (on same row, far right)\n\nGoing RIGHT leads to many apples: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,2), (9,4). Going UP leads to (6,5), (6,6), (6,8), (7,9), (8,7).\n\nBoth directions have apples. But RIGHT seems to have more apples closer together in the lower right quadrant. UP has apples more spread out vertically.\n\nAlso, enemy is at (4,3). If I go RIGHT to (5,4), I'm moving away from them but staying in the same general area. If I go UP to (4,5), I'm moving away and up.\n\nLet me check board boundaries and body positions. My body will extend to [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] after I move. So I'll have a long body stretching leftward.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), my new body: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\nIf I go UP to (4,5), my new body: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3), my new body: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n\nThe body is the same in all cases, just the head position changes.\n\nNow, about the enemy's possible moves. They're at (4,3). Their body is [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]. So they have a vertical body below them.\n\nIf they go UP to (4,4), they're moving into my current head position (but I'm moving away).\nIf they go RIGHT to (5,3), that's empty.\nIf they go DOWN to (4,2), that's their body - death.\nIf they go LEFT to (3,3), that's my body - death.\n\nSo they'll likely go UP or RIGHT.\n\nIf they go UP to (4,4) and I go RIGHT to (5,4):\n- Me: (5,4)\n- Them: (4,4)\n- No collision. We're adjacent. Next turn, they could go RIGHT to (5,4) where I am - collision! If they have 3 apples and I have 3 apples, collision = both die = draw.\n\nIf they go UP to (4,4) and I go UP to (4,5):\n- Me: (4,5)\n- Them: (4,4)\n- No collision. Next turn, they could go UP to (4,5) where I am - collision.\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (5,3) and I go RIGHT to (5,4):\n- Me: (5,4)\n- Them: (5,3)\n- No collision. Next turn, they could go UP to (5,4) where I am - collision.\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (5,3) and I go UP to (4,5):\n- Me: (4,5)\n- Them: (5,3)\n- No collision. Next turn, they could go LEFT to (4,3) or UP to (5,4) or RIGHT to (6,3).\n\nThe pattern is: after any move, the enemy will likely be adjacent to me. If they move into my head, we collide. Since we have equal apples, collision = both die = draw.\n\nBut wait! There's a rule: \"If he crashes into you, he loses.\" This means if their head moves into my body, they die. But if they move into my HEAD (same cell), we both die.\n\nSo to WIN, I need them to move into my body, not my head. Or I need to move into their body. Or I need to have more apples than them when we collide head-on.\n\nCurrently equal apples. If we collide head-on, it's a draw. Not a win.\n\nBut if I can get MORE apples before a collision, I win if we collide.\n\nSo my priority should be to eat apples while avoiding head-on collisions until I have a lead.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is reachable in 2 moves from here: RIGHT to (5,4), then RIGHT to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3). Or RIGHT to (5,4), then RIGHT to (6,4) is empty? Let me check board.\n\nRow 4: `. . . T 1 . . . . A` - so (5,4) is empty, (6,4) is empty, (7,4) empty, (8,4) empty, (9,4) has apple.\n\nRow 3: `. . . T 0 . A . . .` - (5,3) empty, (6,3) has apple, (7,3) empty.\n\nRow 2: `. . . T T . A A . .` - (5,2) empty, (6,2) has apple, (7,2) has apple.\n\nSo if I go RIGHT to (5,4), then next turn I could go RIGHT to (6,4), then DOWN to (6,3) for the apple. Or I could go DOWN to (5,3) if it's empty, then RIGHT to (6,3).\n\nActually, from (5,4), I could go DOWN to (5,3) which is empty, then RIGHT to (6,3) for the apple. That's 2 turns.\n\nIf I go UP to (4,5), then I could go RIGHT to (5,5), then RIGHT to (6,5) for the apple. That's also 2 turns.\n\nBoth are similar distance. But the RIGHT direction has more apples clustered: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,2) are all close together. The UP direction has (6,5), (6,6), (6,8) but they're more spaced out vertically.\n\nAlso, staying in the lower half might be better because the board is 10x10 and we're at y=4. Going UP moves me to y=5,6,7,8,9. Going RIGHT keeps me around y=3,4,5.\n\nLet me check enemy potential. If I go RIGHT and they go UP, they'll be at (4,4). If I go RIGHT and they go RIGHT, they'll be at (5,3).\n\nIf they're at (5,3) and I'm at (5,4), they're directly below me. If next turn they go UP to (5,4), that's my head - collision. If I have more apples by then, I win. But currently equal.\n\nSo I need to get an apple BEFORE they force a collision.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is close. If I go RIGHT to (5,4) now, then next turn I go RIGHT to (6,4) or DOWN to (5,3), then get the apple.\n\nBut wait, if I go RIGHT to (5,4) and they go RIGHT to (5,3), I'm at (5,4), they're at (5,3). Next turn, if I go DOWN to (5,3), that's their head - collision. If they go UP to (5,4), that's my head - collision. So we might be forced to collide next turn if we're adjacent vertically/horizontally.\n\nUnless I move away. If I'm at (5,4) and they're at (5,3), I could go UP to (5,5) or LEFT to (4,4) or RIGHT to (6,4). They could go DOWN to (5,2) or LEFT to (4,3) or RIGHT to (6,3).\n\nSo we have options to avoid collision.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me simplify.\n\nThe board is 10x10. We're at turn 7 of 150. We have plenty of time. I should focus on area control and apple accumulation.\n\nGoing UP to (4,5) moves me toward the apple at (6,5) and the vertical apple cluster. It also moves me away from the enemy who is below me at (4,3). This seems safer and gives me more space.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (5,4) moves me toward the horizontal apple cluster but keeps me at the same y-level as the enemy's potential positions. More congested.\n\nGoing DOWN to (4,3) is direct confrontation. High risk.\n\nGiven the long-term strategy of \"boxing him in and making him crash out,\" I should probably control more territory and limit his options. Going UP allows me to control the upper part of the board while he's stuck in the lower part.\n\nAlso, if I go UP and he goes UP to chase me, his body will follow and he might trap himself. If I go UP and he goes RIGHT, I have the upper area to myself.\n\nLet me also consider my body. My body currently occupies (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) - a vertical line at x=3. If I go UP to (4,5), my body becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]. So I'll have a hook shape: head at (4,5), body going left to (4,4), then down to (3,4), (3,3), (3,2).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), my body becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] - same shape but head at (5,4).\n\nThe body shape matters for future mobility. With a hook shape, I can potentially trap the enemy by circling around.\n\nActually, I just realized something. If I go DOWN to (4,3), and the enemy goes UP to (4,4), we swap. Then my body is [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] and their body is [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]. We're intertwined! That could lead to a collision soon.\n\nBut if I go UP to (4,5), I'm moving away from the entanglement. That seems cleaner.\n\nLet me make a decision. I'll go UP to (4,5). This moves me toward the apple at (6,5), gives me control of the upper area, and avoids immediate confrontation. I can then reassess next turn based on where the enemy goes.\n\nIf the enemy goes UP to (4,4), we're adjacent but not colliding. If they go RIGHT to (5,3), they're moving away. Either way, I have the upper hand in positioning.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING UP! Let's secure that territory and hunt down those apples!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:** Move UP to (4,5) to control the upper board and target the apple cluster at (6,5), (6,6), (6,8). This avoids direct confrontation while positioning for long-term dominance. Watch enemy movement - if they chase me up, they'll stretch their body and potentially trap themselves. If they go right, I claim the vertical territory. Either way, I'm setting up to force a collision on MY terms when I have the apple advantage.\n\nUP",

Turn 8, we're still locked at 3-3 apples! \ud83d\udd25 The enemy is at (5,3) with body [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], and I'm at (4,5) with body [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3)]. \n\nLet's analyze the current board state carefully. From my head at (4,5), my possible moves:\n\n**UP to (4,6):** Looking at the board, row 6 shows \"A\" at (0,6), (3,6), (6,6) but (4,6) appears empty. Not in my body (my body is at x=3-4, y=4-5). Not in enemy body (enemy body is at y=1-3). SAFE.\n\n**DOWN to (4,4):** This is my OWN BODY! (4,4) is currently my first body segment. Moving into my own body = DEATH. ELIMINATED.\n\n**LEFT to (3,5):** Check board row 5: \". . . . . . A . . .\" - (3,5) is empty. Not my body (my body is at x=3,4 but y=4,3,2). (3,5) is clear! Not enemy body. SAFE.\n\n**RIGHT to (5,5):** Board shows \". . . . . . A . . .\" at row 5, so (5,5) is empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. SAFE.\n\nSo I have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is death.\n\nNow, let's think strategically. I'm at (4,5), enemy at (5,3). That's a knight's move away! \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP to (4,6):** This moves me toward the apple cluster at (6,5), (6,6), (6,8). I can see (6,5) is just two moves away: (4,6)\u2192(5,6)\u2192(6,5). This is a clear path to grow and potentially hit 6 apples. The upper board has tons of apples: (6,8), (7,9), (8,7), (3,8). If I claim the top-right area, I dominate.\n\n**LEFT to (3,5):** This moves me left into a tighter space. My body is already creating a vertical wall at x=3. Moving to (3,5) would put me right on top of my own body's vertical line. That limits my escape routes. Bad idea. Boxed in.\n\n**RIGHT to (5,5):** This moves me right, toward the enemy who's at (5,3). If I go RIGHT to (5,5), I'm two cells above the enemy at (5,3). That's getting into the danger zone. The enemy might move UP toward me, potentially setting up a head-on collision. If we both have equal apples (3-3), head-on collision = double KO = draw. I don't want a draw! I want to win! \ud83d\ude08\n\nAlso, if I go RIGHT to (5,5), I'm putting myself directly above the enemy's potential path. They could move UP to (5,4) next turn, and then we'd be adjacent. That's risky.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:** UP to (4,6) gives me the cleanest path to secure multiple apples and build a lead. I can sweep through the top-right apple cluster and potentially reach 6 apples while the enemy is still in the lower half. This gives me the apple advantage needed to force a collision later.\n\nIf I go UP:\n- I head toward apples at (6,5), (6,6), (6,8), (3,8), (7,9), (8,7)\n- I avoid immediate confrontation\n- I keep my mobility in the upper half\n- The enemy will likely have to chase me up or stay low\n\nIf the enemy goes RIGHT to (6,3), they're moving toward (6,5) but from below. If I reach (6,5) first, I can potentially trap them.\n\nActually, wait. Let me check the board more carefully. Row 6: \"A . . A . . A . . .\" - so apples at (0,6), (3,6), (6,6). Row 5: \". . . . . . A . . .\" - apple at (6,5). \n\nIf I go UP to (4,6), I'm adjacent to (3,6) apple! That's a one-move follow-up for next turn: (4,6)\u2192(3,6) to eat apple. That's HUGE!\n\nLet me trace the path:\nTurn 8: I go UP to (4,6)\nTurn 9: I go LEFT to (3,6) \u2192 eat apple! I grow to 4 apples!\nTurn 10: I could go LEFT to (2,6) or UP to (3,7), heading toward the apple cluster at (6,8), (8,7), (7,9)\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy at (5,3) has to navigate through their own tight space. Their body blocks many directions. If I grow to 4 apples while they're stuck at 3, I have the advantage. Then I can force a head-on collision when I'm winning!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Go UP to (4,6) \u2192 next turn go LEFT to (3,6) and eat that apple (4th apple!). Then sweep the top-right: target (6,8), (7,9), (8,7). While building my score to 6+, force enemy into a corner and initiate a winning head-on collision. Keep the pressure on and don't let them breathe!\n\nCHAT, UP WE GO! Let's claim that upper territory! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

Enemy #0 is at (6,3) with body [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], 4 apples. I'm behind! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**EVALUATING MY MOVES FROM (4,6):**\n\n**UP to (4,7):** Board shows row 7: \". . . . . . . . A .\" - (4,7) is EMPTY! Not in my body (y=4-5). Not in enemy body (y=1-3). SAFE!\n\n**DOWN to (4,5):** My own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 DEAD on arrival. ELIMINATED!\n\n**LEFT to (3,6):** Board row 6: \"A . . A 1 . A . . .\" - Wait, at (3,6) there's an 'A' (apple)! But check the body: My head is at (4,6), body at (4,5), (4,4), (3,4). (3,6) is NOT in my body! However, I need to be careful - is (3,6) blocked by enemy? Enemy is at (6,3) and body is at y=1-3, x=4-6. So (3,6) is CLEAR! SAFE and leads to eating an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**RIGHT to (5,6):** Board row 6 shows (5,6) is EMPTY (between my head at (4,6) and apple at (6,6)). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. SAFE!\n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\n\nWait! CRITICAL REALIZATION: If I go LEFT to (3,6), I eat an apple! That's my 4th apple, tying the score 4-4! And my head will be at (3,6).\n\nBut let's check if (3,6) is truly safe from enemy movement. Enemy at (6,3) could potentially move UP-left toward me, but they'd need multiple turns to reach (3,6). \n\nActually, let me reconsider the board state. Looking at row 6: \"A . . A 1 . A . . .\"\n- Position (0,6): A\n- Position (1,6): .\n- Position (2,6): .\n- Position (3,6): A (apple!)\n- Position (4,6): 1 (me, currently)\n- Position (5,6): .\n- Position (6,6): A\n\nSo moving LEFT to (3,6) would let me eat the apple at (3,6)! That's a HUGE play - I'd grow to 4 apples, tying the enemy at 4-4.\n\nBut is it SAFE? Let's think about enemy's possible moves. Enemy at (6,3) with body stretching down to (4,1). They're constrained by their own body. If they move UP to (6,4), that's safe for them. If they move LEFT to (5,3), that's their body segment! They'd die. If they move RIGHT to (7,3), that's empty. If they move DOWN to (6,2), that's empty.\n\nSo they likely move UP, RIGHT, or DOWN. None of those get them to (3,6) this turn. They'd need at least 3 turns to get to me (6,3)\u2192(5,4)\u2192(4,5)\u2192(3,6). By then I'll have eaten multiple apples and grown my body.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (3,6):** EAT APPLE! Tie score 4-4. Creates new head position at (3,6). Future moves: I can go UP to (3,7), RIGHT to (4,6) (back), LEFT to (2,6), or DOWN to (3,5). All potentially safe. This is AGGRESSIVE and SCORE-FOCUSED!\n\n2. **UP to (4,7):** Safe, but no immediate apple. I'm moving away from the apple cluster at (3,6), (6,6), (6,5). Less optimal.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (5,6):** Safe, but again no immediate apple. Moves me toward enemy territory but away from the (3,6) apple.\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY: LEFT TO (3,6) \ud83c\udfaf**\n\nWhy LEFT is best:\n- IMMEDIATE apple! 4th apple, ties the score 4-4\n- Gets me closer to the apple cluster at (6,5), (6,6), (6,8)\n- Positions me to dominate the left side of the board\n- Enemy is far away (at x=6) and can't reach me this turn\n- After eating, I have multiple escape routes: UP, LEFT, or even RIGHT back to (4,6)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat the apple at (3,6) to tie 4-4. Then next turn, I can go UP to (3,7) or LEFT to (2,6) to continue toward the upper-left apple cluster. I need to outgrow the enemy to force a winning head-on collision. Once I have the lead (5+ apples), I can trap them in the bottom-right and initiate the KO! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLET'S GET THIS BREAD! LEFT it is!\n\nLEFT",

NOPE. \u274c\n- UP -> (6,4): empty and safe, but doesn\u2019t grab an apple and gives fewer immediate pressure options. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT -> (7,3): safe, pushes us rightward toward (7,2) apple next turn\u2014ok but slower to grow and claim center control. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN -> (6,2): apple sits here! Safe this turn (no opponent head threat), we eat and GROW \u2014 immediate lead and more body to box with. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n\nEnemy peek: Opponent head at (4,6). They cannot move DOWN into (4,5) because that's their neck, so they\u2019re limited to LEFT/RIGHT/UP this turn (likely LEFT to (3,6) for that apple). No realistic simultaneous head-on into (6,2).

Right now, grow and seize board control. \ud83d\ude08\n\nDecision logic:\n1) Eliminate deadly moves \u2014 LEFT is death.  \n2) Among safe moves, prefer immediate apple + keep multiple exits open. DOWN (6,2) gives an apple and leaves us with three good follow-ups (LEFT to 5,2, RIGHT to 7,2 apple, DOWN to 6,1 apple) \u2014 keeps options open and ramps our ability to box column 4\u20136.  \n3) Aggro goal: force them into tightening corridor around x=4\u20136 and pressure them into wall or their own body. Grow first, then cut.\n\nShort long-term plan (for next rationale clip):\n- Eat (6,2) now to go up to 5 apples. Use added length to control columns 4\u20136.\n- Next turns: chain (6,1) or (7,2) apples to keep length and mobility; avoid getting trapped on edges.\n- Aim to corral opponent westward into the 3\u20134 column and close the gap; if they try to bull-head us when we have higher apples, force the head-on / KO situation in our favor.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT \u2014 be bold, be ruthless, take the apple and lock him in.

I need to close that gap FAST. My head is at (3,6) after last turn's LEFT move that ate the apple. I grew to 4 apples\u2014nice! But the enemy still leads by 1. I must stay aggressive.  \n\n**Evaluating moves from (3,6):**  \n- **UP to (3,7):** Board shows row 7: \". . . . . . . . A .\" \u2014 (3,7) is EMPTY. Not in my body (current body: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)). Not in enemy body (they're at y=2-3). SAFE.  \n- **DOWN to (3,5):** Row 5: \". . . . T . A . . .\" \u2014 (3,5) is EMPTY? Wait, look at board: row 5 has \"T\" at (4,5) and (5,5)? Actually, row 5: \". . . . T . A . . .\" means (3,5) is '.' (empty). But check my body: (4,5) is part of my tail. (3,5) is not in my body. Enemy body? No. SAFE.  \n- **LEFT to (2,6):** Row 6: \"A . . A 1 . A . . .\" \u2014 (2,6) is '.' (empty). Not in my body (my body is at x=3,4). Not in enemy body. SAFE.  \n- **RIGHT to (4,6):** This is my current tail position! Wait, my head is at (3,6), body is [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)]. So (4,6) is the first body segment after my head. Moving RIGHT back to (4,6) would be moving into my own body\u2014DEAD on arrival! That's a self-collision. ELIMINATED!  \n\n**Strategic breakdown:**  \nSo RIGHT is a death trap. UP, DOWN, or LEFT are safe. Now, where\u2019s the enemy? Enemy #0 at (6,2) with body [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. They\u2019re in the bottom-right. They might move UP toward me, but they\u2019re far (distance 3-4 turns). I need to grow and dominate.  \n\n**Apple opportunities:**  \n- Up at (3,7): no apple.  \n- Down at (3,5): no apple.  \n- Left at (2,6): no apple.  \n- But there are apples nearby: (6,6), (6,5), (6,8), (5,9), (2,7), etc. I need to head toward clusters.  \n\n**Choosing the best move:**  \n- **LEFT to (2,6):** Moves me left, away from the enemy who\u2019s on the right. Opens up path to apples at (0,6), (0,8), (0,9), (2,7). Safe, and keeps me in the upper-middle area.  \n- **UP to (3,7):** Moves me up, toward apples at (2,7), (3,8), (5,9). Also safe.  \n- **DOWN to (3,5):** Moves me down toward my own tail area, which could get cramped later. Not ideal for growth.  \n\nI want to stay agile and not get boxed in. Moving LEFT or UP both give good options. But let\u2019s think: enemy is at y=2, so moving down could bring me closer to them in future turns? Actually, I\u2019m at y=6, enemy at y=2, so moving down is still far. But staying in the middle (y=6) is better for flexibility.  \n\n**Aggressive play:** I need to chase apples and eventually trap the enemy. Moving LEFT to (2,6) positions me to grab (2,7) apple next turn (by going UP) or head toward (0,6). Also, moving LEFT reduces collision risk with enemy since they\u2019re on the right.  \n\n**Decision:** LEFT is the move! It\u2019s safe, opens up left-side apples, and avoids the right-side where the enemy might eventually push. Plus, I can always pivot to UP next turn for (2,7) or (3,8).  \n\n**Long-term plan:** After LEFT to (2,6), next turn aim for (2,7) or (1,6) to grab apples and grow. Keep an eye on enemy\u2014if they head up, I may need to cut them off. Once I lead by 2+ apples, I can start boxing them in the bottom-right.  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\nLEFT",

Eating an apple = +1 point and +1 length\n   - After eating, I'd have 5 apples, closing the gap!\n\n2. **DOWN to (2,5):**\n   - Board shows (2,5) is empty (row 5: \". . . . T . A . . .\")\n   - No apple, no immediate growth\n   - Safe but not productive\n\n3. **LEFT to (1,6):**\n   - Board shows (1,6) is empty (row 6: \"A . . A 1 . A . . .\" - wait, (1,6) is '.' between the A at (0,6) and the A at (2,6)? Actually row 6 shows \"A . . A\" so (1,6) is empty)\n   - No apple, no growth\n   - Safe but not aggressive\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3,6):**\n   - This is my current body segment! MOVING INTO MY OWN BODY = INSTANT DEATH! \u2620\ufe0f\n   - ELIMINATED IMMEDIATELY!\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- The enemy is at (7,2) - they might move UP or LEFT, but they're still 5-6 turns away from me\n- I need apples urgently to catch up\n- (2,7) is RIGHT THERE with an apple - this is a golden opportunity!\n- Eating the apple gives me momentum and keeps me in the upper area where there are more apples\n- After getting that apple, I can go for (2,8) or (1,7) or (3,8) next turn\n\n**Long-term Plan:**  \nEat (2,7) to get to 5 apples. Then push toward the top-left apple cluster: (0,6), (0,8), (0,9). Once I have 7-8 apples, I can start maneuvering to cut off enemy #0's escape routes. If I get 2+ apples ahead, I can force a head-on collision in their territory. They're slow and methodical - I need to be explosive!\n\n**Decision:** UP to (2,7) is the only move that makes sense! It's safe, it grows me, it gives me points, and it keeps me in the game!\n\nUP",

Neck at (6,2) \u2014 so LEFT is dead (backwards) immediately. Do NOT hit our neck. \ud83d\ude31\n- Opp head way up at (2,6). We\u2019re up 6\u20134. We can be aggressive \u2014 force a head-on later if they close the gap. \ud83d\udc40\n\nMove analysis (fast and loud):\n- LEFT -> (6,2): into our neck. Instant death. ZERO CHILL. \u274c\n- UP -> (7,3): safe. Opens UP or RIGHT next turn (DOWN would be back into neck). Only 2 good exits. Moves us slightly toward the center \u2014 tempting for pressure but slightly constraining. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT -> (8,2): safe. Gives UP, RIGHT, DOWN as follow-ups (LEFT is back into neck). 3 exits, more breathing room, stays off the bottom edge and preserves lateral mobility. Great for creating a perimeter and pivoting towards the mid-board to box the enemy. \u2705\ud83d\udd25\n- DOWN -> (7,1): safe. Also 3 exits (but hugs bottom row more next turn). Puts us in range to snag (6,1) apple next move \u2014 tasty \u2014 but reduces vertical options and can make us easier to corner. \u26a0\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4e\n\nTactical read:\n- Opponent is north-west and boxed by some of their own segments around x=4. They\u2019re trapped-ish but not yet; we want to pressure from the right/above to compress their space.\n- We\u2019re ahead on apples (6 vs 4) \u2014 if they try head-on while we\u2019re longer, we win. So keep options open; don\u2019t prematurely commit to the bottom or a tight corridor.\n- RIGHT keeps max exits and preserves the ability to pivot up later to squeeze them or swing back left when the timing is right.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT to (8,2) to keep flexibility and start shifting our presence left/up from a safer staging area.\n- From there, push UP and then drift left across y=3 to start hemming the opponent into the 0\u20133 columns \u2014 use our length to wall them off.\n- If they tries to close for a head-on while we keep the lead, accept the clash. If they run, shepherd them into a dead-zone and finish them. No apples over ego, but grab easy ones when they aid control.\n\nLET\u2019S DO IT \u2014 pick the flexible, aggressive pivot move: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

My goal: **take control of the upper-left quadrant** (apples at (0,6), (0,8), (0,9), (3,8), (5,9), (6,8), (6,6), (7,9), (8,7)). I need to grow faster than they do. From (2,7), I can push UP toward (2,8) (empty), LEFT toward (1,7) (empty), or RIGHT toward (3,8) (apple!). I\u2019ll prioritize apples but avoid boxing myself into the top edge. Keep mobility.\n\n**TURN 12 ANALYSIS:**  \nMy head is at (2,7) after eating that apple. Body: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4)]. Enemy #0: Head at (8,2), body trailing at (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2). They're still far away. Board shows apples nearby: (3,8), (0,8), (0,9), (2,8) is empty. Let's evaluate moves:\n\n- **UP to (2,8):**  \n  Board shows (2,8) is empty (row 8: \"A . . A . . A . . .\").  \n  Not hitting my body (body is at x=2,3,4, y=6,5,4).  \n  Not hitting enemy body (enemy at y=2-3).  \n  Safe. Moves me toward top-left apple cluster. After this, I could go LEFT to (1,8) or UP again to (2,9) (empty), RIGHT to (3,8) (apple!). Keeps options open. No apple this turn, but sets up for next turn.\n\n- **DOWN to (2,6):**  \n  This is my own body! (2,6) is the first segment after head). Moving into my own body = instant death. \u2620\ufe0f DEAD. ELIMINATE.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,7):**  \n  Row 7: \". . 1 . . . . . A .\" So (1,7) is empty.  \n  Safe. Not hitting body or enemy.  \n  No apple. But moves me toward (0,6) and (0,8). Good for future growth. However, (0,7) might be a dead end if I go further left? (0,7) is empty per board, but (0,6) has an apple. Still, LEFT gives me more horizontal room than UP (which edges closer to top).\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,7):**  \n  Row 7: \". . 1 . . . . . A .\" So (3,7) is empty (since head is at (2,7), body starts at (2,6)).  \n  Safe. Not hitting body.  \n  No apple. But moving toward (3,8) which has an apple. However, my body snakes from (2,6) to (3,6) \u2014 if I go RIGHT, I'm moving closer to my own body but not directly into it. Still, this might limit future LEFT options if I get squeezed.\n\n**STRATEGIC RATIONALE:**  \nI want to set up for an apple next turn. From (2,8) [UP], I can go RIGHT to (3,8) (apple!) or LEFT to (1,8) (empty) or UP to (2,9) (empty). From (1,7) [LEFT], I can go UP to (1,8) (empty), LEFT to (0,7) (empty), or DOWN to (1,6) (empty). Both UP and LEFT are safe. But UP puts me in a position to grab the apple at (3,8) next turn (if I go RIGHT). LEFT puts me closer to (0,6) apple (two turns away: LEFT to (0,7), then DOWN to (0,6)). The enemy is far away; I don't need to panic. I should prioritize moves that give me the most future flexibility. UP to (2,8) gives me three safe exits (LEFT, UP, RIGHT). LEFT to (1,7) gives me three safe exits (UP, LEFT, DOWN). Both are good. However, UP is slightly more central and might allow me to cut off enemy later if they head up. Also, note that (2,8) is one step away from the top edge (y=9), but I can still move LEFT or RIGHT along the top if needed. The board is small; I need to avoid getting trapped. UP seems fine.\n\nChat, we're tied! Let's keep the pressure. I'm choosing **UP** to position for a potential apple next turn and stay in the upper area.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**  \nUP",

          "rationale": "**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe\u2019re tied 5\u20136 and the enemy is hungry in the bottom-right. I need to aggressively claim the upper-left apple cluster (0,6), (0,8), (0,9), (3,8), (5,9), (6,8), (6,6), (7,9), (8,7). While doing that, I must stay flexible to avoid trapping myself near the top edge. I\u2019ll head toward (3,8) apple next turn, but only if the enemy doesn\u2019t block my path. Watch the enemy\u2019s movement\u2014if they go UP, I might need to pivot. Keep mobility, force them into bad positions.\n\n**TURN 13 ANALYSIS:**  \nMy head is at (2,8) after my UP move last turn. Body: [(2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]. Enemy #0: Head at (8,3) after moving UP? Wait, board shows (8,3) as head now. They were at (8,2) last turn, so they moved UP to (8,3). Their body: [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]. They\u2019re still far. Apples: (3,8) is an apple! (Row 8: \"A . 1 A . . A . . .\" so (3,8) is indeed an apple). I can eat it this turn. But I must avoid immediate death.\n\nEvaluate moves from (2,8):\n\n- **UP to (2,9):**  \n  Row 9: \"A . . . . . A . A . .\" so (2,9) is empty.  \n  Not hitting my body (body at y=7,6,5,4). Not hitting enemy body (y=2-3). Safe. But (2,9) is top edge\u2014only LEFT or RIGHT from there. Limits future options. No apple. Not ideal.\n\n- **DOWN to (2,7):**  \n  That\u2019s my own body! (2,7) is the first segment after head). Moving into own body = death. \u2620\ufe0f ELIMINATE.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,8):**  \n  Row 8: (1,8) is empty (since head is at (2,8), body starts at (2,7)).  \n  Safe. No apple. Moves me toward (0,8) and (0,9). But (1,8) is one step from left edge; if I go LEFT again, I hit (0,8) which is empty? Wait, board shows (0,8) as apple (row 8: \"A . . A . . A . . .\"). So (0,8) is apple. From (1,8), I could go LEFT to (0,8) apple next turn. But (0,8) is at x=0, y=8\u2014after eating, I could go UP to (0,9) apple or DOWN to (0,7) empty. That\u2019s two exits, but (0,8) is corner-adjacent. Not terrible, but less mobile than RIGHT.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,8):**  \n  Row 8: (3,8) is apple (see above).  \n  Safe? Check: my body at (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). (3,8) is not occupied by my body. Enemy body at y=2-3, so not hit. But wait\u2014enemy head is at (8,3), far away. However, enemy might move UP toward (8,4) or left? But that\u2019s later.  \n  Moving RIGHT onto apple = GROW +1 point! That would tie score at 6\u20136. After eating, head at (3,8), body gains new segment at (2,8). Future options from (3,8): UP to (3,9) (row 9: \"A . . . . . A . A . .\" so (3,9) is empty? Wait, row 9: \"A . . . . . A . A . .\"\u2014positions: (0,9)=A, (1,9)=., (2,9)=., (3,9)=., (4,9)=., (5,9)=A, (6,9)=., (7,9)=A, (8,9)=A, (9,9)=. So (3,9) is empty. Good. LEFT to (2,8) (now empty after I move? Wait, I'm moving into (3,8), so (2,8) will be my new body segment? Actually, after eating, my body becomes [(3,8), (2,8), (2,7), ...] so (2,8) is now occupied by my body. But for future moves from (3,8), LEFT to (2,8) would be into my own body (the segment just behind). That\u2019s backwards into own body\u2014death. So LEFT is NOT safe from (3,8) because it\u2019s exactly the cell I came from? Wait, rule: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" So from (3,8), moving LEFT to (2,8) would be moving into the cell that was my head before I moved? Actually, after moving, my head is at (3,8), and the segment behind is (2,8). So moving LEFT would be moving back into that segment, which is still part of my body. That\u2019s death. So LEFT is out.  \n  From (3,8), I could go RIGHT to (4,8) (empty? row 8: \"A . . A . . A . . .\" so (4,8) is empty? Wait, (4,8) is after (3,8), so yes empty). Or UP to (3,9) empty. Or DOWN to (3,7) empty. So at least two safe exits (UP and RIGHT) if not three. DOWN to (3,7) might be safe if my body doesn\u2019t block it. My body after growth: head (3,8), next segment (2,8), then (2,7), etc. So (3,7) is not in my body, so safe. So from (3,8), I have UP, RIGHT, DOWN. Good mobility.  \n  BUT there\u2019s a catch: if enemy moves aggressively toward the center, they might threaten me later. But right now, eating the apple is the best for growth. And I\u2019m tied, so eating pulls me ahead or ties. Actually, enemy has 6, I have 5. If I eat, I become 6, tie again. But growth itself is good.\n\nWait, check if moving RIGHT to (3,8) could cause a head-on collision this turn? Enemy heads move simultaneously. Enemy #0 head at (8,3). Could they move to (3,8)? No, too far. They\u2019re at x=8, y=3; (3,8) is x=3, y=8. They\u2019d need to move left 5 and up 5 in one turn\u2014impossible. So no collision.\n\nWhat about other snakes? Only two snakes. So safe.\n\nBut also consider: if I eat apple at (3,8), I grow, and my body fills (2,8). Then, the enemy might move toward me? Unlikely this turn. They\u2019re focused on bottom-right apples. They have apples at (6,0), (5,1), (0,1), etc. They might go for (6,0) or (5,1). Not threatening me.\n\nSo RIGHT is the aggressive move: eat apple, tie score, grow, and maintain mobility.\n\nCompare with LEFT: from (2,8) LEFT to (1,8) empty. No apple. Then next turn, I could go LEFT to (0,8) apple, but that would eat apple at (0,8) and grow. That\u2019s two turns to get an apple, whereas RIGHT gives apple immediately. Time matters\u2014enemy might eat apples faster. So RIGHT is better.\n\nUP to (2,9) empty: no apple, and limits mobility (top edge). Not ideal.\n\nDOWN is death.\n\nThus, best move: RIGHT to (3,8) apple.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**  \nRIGHT",

Good for continuing the clamp and looking for a future head-on when they try to slip right.\n- LEFT to (7,3): pulls us toward center and shortens the horizontal gap faster, but doesn\u2019t gain vertical ground immediately.

I need to dominate the upper-left apple cluster while keeping an eye on the enemy. Enemy is still in the bottom-right. I\u2019ll move toward the next apple at (5,9) or (0,9) while ensuring I don\u2019t box myself in. Prioritize moves that leave me at least two safe exits. If the enemy pushes toward the center, I\u2019ll be ready to cut them off or force a head-on collision if I can get a score lead.\n\n**TURN 14 ANALYSIS:**  \nMy head is at (3,8). Body: [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] after eating. I need to choose my next move. Let's evaluate each direction from (3,8):\n\n- **UP to (3,9):**  \n  Board row 9: (3,9) is empty (from earlier: \"A . . . . . A . A . .\" -> positions (0,9)=A, (1,9)=., (2,9)=., (3,9)=., ...).  \n  Safe? Check my body: my body occupies (2,8), (2,7), etc. (3,9) is not in my body. Enemy body is far away (y=2-3), so not hit.  \n  From (3,9), I'd be on the top edge. Future options: DOWN to (3,8) (but that's my own body? After moving, my body would be [(3,9), (3,8), (2,8), ...] so (3,8) is my body segment. Moving DOWN would be into my own body \u2192 death. So DOWN is out. LEFT to (2,9) is empty? Row 9: (2,9) is empty. RIGHT to (4,9) is empty (row 9: (4,9) is .). So from (3,9), I have LEFT and RIGHT as safe exits, no apple. That's two options, but no growth. Not ideal.\n\n- **DOWN to (3,7):**  \n  Row 7: \" . . T . . . . . A . \" so (3,7) is empty (T at (2,7) is my body, but (3,7) is free).  \n  Safe? My body: (2,8), (2,7), etc. (3,7) is not occupied. Enemy far away.  \n  From (3,7), future options: UP back to (3,8) (my body? After moving, body becomes [(3,7), (3,8), (2,8), ...] so (3,8) is my body. Moving UP would be into own body \u2192 death). DOWN to (3,6) \u2014 but (3,6) is in my body! (body includes (3,6)). So moving DOWN would be into (3,6) \u2192 death. LEFT to (2,7) \u2014 (2,7) is in my body (second segment). Death. RIGHT to (4,7) \u2014 empty? Row 7: (4,7) is empty. So only RIGHT is safe? That gives me only one exit from (3,7). That's risky\u2014getting trapped with only one move. Avoid.\n\n- **LEFT to (2,8):**  \n  (2,8) is currently my body segment? Wait, my head is at (3,8), and my body is [(2,8), ...]. So (2,8) is occupied by my own body. Moving LEFT into (2,8) would be moving directly into my own body \u2192 death. ELIMINATE.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,8):**  \n  Row 8: \"A . . A . . A . . .\" so (4,8) is empty (since (3,8) was apple, now gone).  \n  Safe? Check my body: (2,8), (2,7), etc. (4,8) not in my body. Enemy far.  \n  From (4,8), future options: LEFT to (3,8) (my body? After moving, body becomes [(4,8), (3,8), (2,8), ...] so (3,8) is my body. Moving LEFT would be into own body \u2192 death). UP to (4,9) \u2014 empty (row 9: (4,9) is .). DOWN to (4,7) \u2014 empty. RIGHT to (5,8) \u2014 empty? Row 8: (5,8) is . (since apples at (6,8), (7,9), etc. (5,8) is not listed as apple). So from (4,8), I have UP, DOWN, RIGHT as safe exits. That's three options! Great mobility. Also, I'm moving toward the apple at (5,9) or (6,8) which are in the upper-right area. And I'm staying away from the top edge for now.\n\nNow, check for head-on collisions this turn. Enemy head at (8,4). Could they move to (4,8)? Unlikely\u2014they'd need to move left 4 and up 4 in one turn\u2014impossible. They're likely moving toward bottom-right apples. So no immediate threat.\n\nAmong safe moves, RIGHT to (4,8) gives me the most future options (three exits) and keeps me centrally located in the upper-right, from where I can target apples like (5,9), (6,8), or even swing back left later. UP to (3,9) gives only two exits and no growth potential. DOWN to (3,7) is a trap with only one exit. So RIGHT is best.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**  \nRIGHT",

Enemy is at (9,4) and could climb toward the center. I need to control the upper-left quadrant to box them out and force them into the bottom-right maze where they might crash. I\u2019ll grab the cluster near (0,9) and (0,6) while keeping my tail mobile\u2014no self-traps. If I can get to 8 apples and the enemy makes a mistake, we push for head-on collision and end this.\n\n**TURN 15 ANALYSIS:**  \nHead at (4,8). Body: [(3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]. Enemy at (9,4) with body trailing left. I need to pick a move that keeps me alive, expands my board control, and doesn\u2019t give the enemy an easy path to my apples. Let\u2019s evaluate:\n\n- **UP to (4,9):**  \n  Row 9: (4,9) is empty (board shows . at (4,9)).  \n  Safe? My body doesn\u2019t occupy it, enemy is far.  \n  From (4,9): DOWN to (4,8) would be my body after moving (since I\u2019d leave (4,8)). LEFT to (3,9) empty, RIGHT to (5,9) empty (apple at (5,9)!). So I\u2019d have LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN as exits\u2014three options, and RIGHT gets me to an apple. Good move, but puts me on top edge with limited upward moves later. Still, strong.\n\n- **DOWN to (4,7):**  \n  Row 7: (4,7) is empty.  \n  Safe? Yes.  \n  From (4,7): UP to (4,8) (my body), DOWN to (4,6) (my body), LEFT to (3,7) empty, RIGHT to (5,7) empty. So LEFT and RIGHT are safe\u2014two options. Not bad, but I\u2019m moving away from apples and toward the center where the enemy might push. Meh.\n\n- **LEFT to (3,8):**  \n  (3,8) is my body segment\u2014immediate death. ELIMINATE.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,8):**  \n  Row 8: (5,8) is empty.  \n  Safe? Yes.  \n  From (5,8): LEFT to (4,8) (my body), RIGHT to (6,8) (apple! if I eat it, I grow and gain an option). UP to (5,9) (apple!), DOWN to (5,7) empty. So I\u2019d have UP, RIGHT, DOWN as safe exits\u2014three options, and two apples in sight. This is aggressive and grows my score. Enemy is nowhere near. Let\u2019s go.\n\nBetween UP (to (4,9)) and RIGHT (to (5,8)), RIGHT is better because it targets two apples ((5,9) and (6,8)) and keeps me more central. Plus, eating an apple now extends my lead to 8\u20136, putting pressure on the enemy. If I eat (5,8) next turn, I\u2019ll have even more control. Let\u2019s do this.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**  \nRIGHT",

(6,8) is clear.\n   - If I eat it, I grow to 7 apples (tying score!) and extend my length.\n   - Future options from (6,8): \n     - LEFT to (5,8) (my current head, will be empty next turn)\n     - RIGHT to (7,8) (empty on board)\n     - DOWN to (6,7) (empty)\n     - UP to (6,9) (empty? board row 9 shows (6,9) is \".\")\n   - That's 3-4 safe exits. Good.\n   - **BUT**: If enemy moves UP to (9,6) and I move RIGHT to (6,8), no collision. We're far apart.\n   - **RISK**: If enemy moves LEFT to (8,5) and I move RIGHT to (6,8), still safe.\n   - **BIG PICTURE**: Eating this apple ties me at 7-7 and gives me more board control in the upper-right. Enemy is bottom-right. I can continue dominating upper zones.\n\n3. **UP (to 5,9)** - **APPLE!** (5,9) is an apple. Safe?\n   - (5,9) is empty currently.\n   - My body: none at (5,9).\n   - Enemy body: none at (5,9).\n   - If I eat it, I grow to 7 apples (tying score!).\n   - Future options from (5,9):\n     - DOWN to (5,8) (my current head, will be empty)\n     - LEFT to (4,9) (empty)\n     - RIGHT to (6,9) (empty)\n   - That's 3 safe exits. Good.\n   - **RISK**: If enemy moves UP to (9,6) and I move UP to (5,9), no collision.\n   - **BIG PICTURE**: Eating this apple also ties the score. Positionally, (5,9) is more central-upper, good for controlling the top edge.\n\n4. **DOWN (to 5,7)** - **NO APPLE**. Empty cell.\n   - Safe? (5,7) is empty.\n   - Future options: UP to (5,8) (my body), DOWN to (5,6) (empty), LEFT to (4,7) (empty), RIGHT to (6,7) (empty).\n   - Only 3 exits (UP is my body after moving).\n   - **PROBLEM**: Moving DOWN takes me away from both apples and toward the center where enemy might push. I'm giving up guaranteed growth. Not ideal when I'm behind.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI need to TIE THE SCORE and aggressively expand. Both RIGHT (to 6,8) and UP (to 5,9) give me +1 apple and tie the game 7-7. \n\n- **RIGHT (6,8)** is slightly better for long-term control: It puts me deeper into the upper-right quadrant, near other apples ((7,9) is nearby, (8,7) is nearby). From there, I can sweep the top-right and potentially cut off enemy's escape if they try to go up.\n- **UP (5,9)** is also good but puts me on the top edge with slightly fewer immediate apple options (only (6,9) and (4,9) nearby, no apples listed there). However, (5,9) is directly above my current path, so movement feels natural.\n\nBut wait! Look at the apple list: (7,9) is an apple. From (6,8), I can go RIGHT to (7,8) then UP to (7,9) next turn. From (5,9), I'd have to go RIGHT to (6,9) then RIGHT to (7,9) (two moves). So (6,8) gives faster access to (7,9).\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** \nEnemy at (9,5). They might move DOWN to (9,4) to chase apples at (9,3) or (8,7)? Actually (9,3) is an apple. From (9,5), DOWN to (9,4) is safe (empty). LEFT to (8,5) is safe. UP to (9,6) is safe. They'll probably chase the nearest apple. (9,3) is 2 squares away DOWN. They might go DOWN. If they go DOWN, they're moving away from me. Perfect.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- If I move RIGHT to (6,8) and enemy moves UP to (9,6): No collision. Safe.\n- If I move RIGHT to (6,8) and enemy moves LEFT to (8,5): No collision. Safe.\n- If I move RIGHT to (6,8) and enemy moves DOWN to (9,4): No collision. Safe.\n- Head-on collision? Only if they move LEFT to (5,5) and I move RIGHT to (6,8)? No, different coordinates. Impossible this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\n- After eating at (6,8), I'll have 7 apples. Enemy likely 7 (if they eat an apple this turn) or 7 (if they don't). I need to push for 8+ to lead.\n- From (6,8), I'll target (7,9) next (apple). Then sweep upper-right: (8,7), (6,6), etc.\n- Box enemy in bottom-right by controlling top-right and upper-left. Force them into tight spaces where they'll crash into their own body or walls.\n- If I get a lead (8+ apples), I can consider aggressive head-on collision to finish them. But first, secure the tie and expand.\n\n**FINAL MOVE: RIGHT** to (6,8) for the apple, tie the score, and position for upper-right dominance. Let's go!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nEat at (6,8) to tie 7-7. Push to (7,9) next. Control top-right quadrant to cut off enemy escape routes. Force them into bottom-right maze. When leading, consider head-on collision to end this. Stay mobile, avoid self-traps. Let's box him in! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**MOVE:**  \nRIGHT",

Enemy #0 is at **(9,6)**, moving toward the top-right? Let\u2019s break it down.  \n\n**MY CURRENT STATE:**  \n- **Head:** (6,8)  \n- **Body:** [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6)]  \n- **Apples:** 7 (TIED!)  \n\n**ENEMY STATE:**  \n- **Head:** (9,6)  \n- **Body:** [(9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2)]  \n- **Apples:** 7  \n\n**BOARD HIGHLIGHTS:**  \n- **Nearby Apples:** (7,9) is 1 step UP-RIGHT from me. (8,7) is 2 steps RIGHT and 1 DOWN. (6,6) is 2 steps DOWN.  \n- **Enemy\u2019s Path:** They\u2019re at (9,6). If they go LEFT to (8,6), that\u2019s empty. UP to (9,7) is empty. DOWN to (9,5) is their own body (DEAD). So they\u2019ll likely go LEFT or UP.  \n- **Threats:** If I move LEFT to (5,8), that\u2019s my own body (DEAD). If I move DOWN to (6,7), that\u2019s empty. If I move RIGHT to (7,8), empty. If I move UP to (6,9), empty.  \n\n**MOVE EVALUATION:**  \n1. **LEFT (5,8)** - **DEAD!** That\u2019s my own body. \ud83d\udeab  \n2. **UP (6,9)** - **SAFE.** Empty cell. From here, I can go LEFT (5,9) [empty], RIGHT (7,9) [APPLE!], or DOWN (6,8) [my old spot]. Great future options.  \n3. **RIGHT (7,8)** - **SAFE.** Empty cell. From here, I can go UP (7,9) [APPLE!], LEFT (6,8) [empty], DOWN (7,7) [empty]. Also solid.  \n4. **DOWN (6,7)** - **SAFE.** Empty cell. From here, I can go UP (6,8) [empty], LEFT (5,7) [empty], RIGHT (7,7) [empty], DOWN (6,6) [APPLE!]. This leads to an apple but takes me away from the top-right action.  \n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**  \nI need to **dominate the top-right** and force the enemy into a trap. Moving **UP to (6,9)** gives me access to **(7,9)** next turn (an apple!). Moving RIGHT to (7,8) also lets me grab (7,9) next turn. But (6,9) puts me on the top edge, cutting off enemy\u2019s escape upward.  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nThey\u2019ll likely move **LEFT to (8,6)** to chase apples (8,7) or (7,9). If they do, I\u2019ll be at (6,9), and we\u2019re far apart. No head-on collision risk.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- If I move UP to (6,9) and enemy moves LEFT to (8,6): Safe.  \n- If I move UP to (6,9) and enemy moves UP to (9,7): Safe.  \n- If I move UP to (6,9) and enemy moves DOWN to (9,5): Safe (they\u2019d hit their own body).  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n- **Turn 17:** Move UP to (6,9) to secure top-edge control.  \n- **Turn 18:** Move RIGHT to (7,9) to eat the apple and take the lead (8-7).  \n- **Turn 19+:** Sweep the top-right\u2014target (8,7) and (6,6). Box the enemy in the bottom-right by controlling the upper zones. If I get a lead, consider a head-on collision to finish them.  \n\n**LET\u2019S GO!** Top-edge dominance incoming. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25  \n\n**MOVE:**  \nUP",

Let\u2019s break it down.\n\n**MY CURRENT STATE:**\n- **Head:** (6,9)\n- **Body:** [(6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]\n- **Apples:** 7\n\n**ENEMY STATE:**\n- **Head:** (8,6)\n- **Body:** [(9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]\n- **Apples:** 7\n\n**BOARD HIGHLIGHTS:**\n- **Apple at (7,9):** Just one step RIGHT from my head. This is a MUST-GRAB. Eating it puts me ahead 8-7.\n- **Apple at (6,6):** Two steps DOWN from me, but that\u2019s away from the top-right action.\n- **Apple at (8,7):** Two steps RIGHT and one DOWN. Could grab after (7,9).\n- **Enemy\u2019s Path:** Enemy at (8,6). If they go UP to (8,7), that\u2019s an apple but empty. If they go LEFT to (7,6), that\u2019s empty. If they go RIGHT to (9,6), that\u2019s their own body (DEAD). If they go DOWN to (8,5), empty. They likely go UP or LEFT.\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION:**\n1. **UP to (6,9):** I\u2019m already at (6,9)! That\u2019s where I am now. Can\u2019t move into my own head.\n2. **DOWN to (6,8):** **DEAD!** That\u2019s my own body (the cell behind my head). Moving backwards into my own body is a crash. \ud83d\udeab\n3. **LEFT to (5,9):** **SAFE.** Empty cell. From here, I can go DOWN to (5,8) [my body - DEAD], LEFT to (4,9) [empty], RIGHT to (6,9) [empty], UP to (5,10) [off board - DEAD]. This leads to dead ends or moving away from the apple.\n4. **RIGHT to (7,9):** **SAFE AND OPTIMAL.** Empty cell, and it\u2019s an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it gives me the lead (8-7). From (7,9), I can go DOWN to (7,8) [empty], LEFT to (6,9) [empty], RIGHT to (8,9) [empty]. Great options.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI MUST grab the apple at (7,9) to take the lead. Moving RIGHT is the only move that does this safely. Going LEFT to (5,9) is safe but doesn\u2019t get me an apple and traps me against the top edge with fewer escape routes. DOWN is death.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy will likely move UP to (8,7) to chase an apple or LEFT to (7,6). Either way, they won\u2019t be near (7,9). If they move UP to (8,7) and I move RIGHT to (7,9), we\u2019re not colliding. If they move LEFT to (7,6), even safer.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,9): Guaranteed apple, +1 point, take the lead. Future moves from there are safe.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,9): No apple, lost momentum, potential dead ends.\n- Moving DOWN: Immediate death. Don\u2019t throw the game.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- **Turn 18:** Move RIGHT to (7,9), eat apple, lead 8-7.\n- **Turn 19:** From (7,9), move DOWN to (7,8) to get closer to (8,7) or (6,6).\n- **Turn 20+:** Chase remaining apples while boxing enemy in bottom-right. If I get a 2+ lead, consider a head-on collision threat to end them.\n- **Domination Goal:** Control top-right, force enemy into a corner. Keep options open!\n\nMOVE:\nRIGHT",

Quick read and play-by-play:\n\nImmediate check of moves from head (8,6):\n- RIGHT -> (9,6) = our neck (backwards) -> ILLEGAL. \u274c\n- DOWN -> (8,5) = clear but doesn\u2019t grab the apple and gives fewer aggressive options. \u2705 (safe)\n- LEFT -> (7,6) = clear, safe, keeps mobility. \u2705 (safe)\n- UP -> (8,7) = apple! Clear and safe \u2014 gives us +1 and puts pressure/top control. \u2705 (safe & high value)\n\nEnemy head (6,9) can go LEFT to (5,9) or RIGHT to (7,9) to eat apples; they CANNOT reach (8,7) this turn, so no head-on risk if we go up. Taking (8,7) gives us the lead (8 vs 7) which is huge \u2014 now we can be the aggressor and force head-on later if needed.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take the apple at (8,7) now to get the lead and grow.\n- From (8,7) prioritize (8,8) or (9,7) to keep exits open and avoid getting funneled against walls.\n- Once we have the lead, push to control the top-right corridor and bait the rival into a risky approach; only force a head-on when we can guarantee we\u2019re longer or on the apple.\n\nFinal call \u2014 we grab the apple and take the lead.

Let's gooo!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My head:** (7,9) \n- **My body:** [(7,9) old head becomes part of body? Wait no, the head moves. Actually, after moving RIGHT from (6,9) to (7,9), the old head (6,9) becomes the first body segment. So my new body: [(6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]\n- **Apples:** 8 (LEAD!)\n- **Enemy #0 head:** (8,7) - he likely moved UP from (8,6) to chase (8,7) apple? Or left? Let's see the board.\n\n**BOARD READING:**\nFrom the board state, I need to infer where everyone is.\n- My old head (6,9) - now body\n- My new head (7,9) - from my last move RIGHT\n- Enemy #0 was at (8,6). He likely moved UP to (8,7) because that's empty on the board (marked 0 in that spot). Good for him, he grabs an apple? No, (8,7) is empty in the apple list. Wait, apple at (8,7) is in the list! Yes, (8,8) is an apple, but (8,7) is empty. He might be chasing (8,8) or (9,3).\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (8,7). Options:\n- UP to (8,8): Apple! (8,8) is an apple.\n- DOWN to (8,6): Body? (8,6) is empty on board (he came from there).\n- LEFT to (7,7): Empty on board.\n- RIGHT to (9,7): Empty on board (9,7) is empty.\n\nHe will likely go UP to (8,8) for the apple. That gives him 9 apples, tying us 9-9.\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (7,9):**\n- UP to (7,10): Off board (dead). NO.\n- DOWN to (7,8): Empty on board. Safe.\n- LEFT to (6,9): My own body (the segment I just vacated). Moving into own body = DEAD. NO.\n- RIGHT to (8,9): Empty on board. Safe.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9).\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n1. **RIGHT to (8,9):** Empty. If enemy goes UP to (8,8), we are adjacent but safe. From (8,9), I can go DOWN to (8,8) (apple!), LEFT to (7,9) (my body? No, (7,9) is my head now, so moving back LEFT from (8,9) to (7,9) would be moving into my own head? Wait, my head is at (7,9). So LEFT is death. UP is off board. RIGHT is off board. Only DOWN to (8,8) is safe from there. This is a trap! If I go RIGHT to (8,9), I'm cornered. Only one safe move (DOWN to (8,8)). And if enemy moves UP to (8,8) simultaneously, we collide! Double death. Not good.\n2. **DOWN to (7,8):** Empty. This is safer. From (7,8), I have multiple options: DOWN to (7,7), RIGHT to (8,8), LEFT to (6,8) (my body? (6,8) is body segment, yes), UP to (7,9) (my head). Wait, UP is into my own head? No, my head moves from (7,9) to (7,8). So the cell behind me (7,9) becomes my body. Moving UP into (7,9) from (7,8) would be moving into my own body? Yes, because (7,9) is the segment I just left. So moving UP into (7,9) is hitting myself. DEAD.\nActually, let's trace carefully. My head is at (7,9). If I move DOWN to (7,8):\n- New head: (7,8)\n- Old head (7,9) becomes body.\n- My body: [(7,9), (6,9), (6,8), ...]\nSo from (7,8), moving UP goes back to (7,9) which is now my body. DEAD.\nMoving LEFT to (6,8) is body. DEAD.\nMoving DOWN to (7,7) is empty.\nMoving RIGHT to (8,8) is empty (and an apple!).\n\nSo from (7,8), safe moves are DOWN (7,7) and RIGHT (8,8). Two options. Good.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n- RIGHT (to 8,9): Only one safe move (DOWN to 8,8), and high risk of head-on collision with enemy if he goes UP to (8,8).\n- DOWN (to 7,8): Two safe moves (DOWN to 7,7 or RIGHT to 8,8). Lower risk. If I go DOWN, enemy likely goes UP to (8,8). I can then go RIGHT to (8,8) on the next turn if he misses, or DOWN to (7,7) to avoid him.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nAvoid the trap at (8,9). Move DOWN to (7,8). This keeps options open and positions me to potentially grab the apple at (8,8) next turn if the enemy doesn't take it. Even if he does, I'm safer in the center.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- **Turn 19:** Move DOWN to (7,8). Secure position.\n- **Turn 20:** Depending on enemy position, either chase (8,8) apple or move DOWN to (7,7) to approach (8,8) from the side. Stay aggressive but avoid head-on collisions unless I have a score lead (currently +1, not enough to risk death).\n- **Goal:** Maintain lead, force enemy into corners, avoid traps.\n\nMOVE:\nDOWN",

From there prioritize moves that keep multiple exits: prefer (8,9) or (9,8) over squeezing into corners.\n- Once we\u2019re longer, bait them into central/top traps and only force head-on when we\u2019re clearly longer or the collision favors us.\n- Keep watching their approach from (7,9) \u2014 if they try to come right/down, cut them off with controlled pressure.\n\nWe grab the apple, get the lead, and start boxing.

Apples: 8 (LEAD!)\n- **Enemy position:** Head at (8,8), body stretching down to (7,2). Apples: 9 (NINE?! Wait, scoreboard says 9-8. Hmm, maybe I misread earlier. Enemy has 9 apples, I have 8. So I'm actually BEHIND! Need to catch up fast.)\n\n**MOVES FROM (7,8):**\n- **UP:** To (7,9) - MY BODY! DEAD. \u274c\n- **DOWN:** To (7,7) - Empty? Board shows (7,7) as '.' (empty). Safe for now. From there, I could go RIGHT to (8,7) (empty), UP to (7,8) (my body), LEFT to (6,7) (empty), DOWN to (7,6) (empty). Multiple options. \u2705\n- **LEFT:** To (6,8) - MY BODY! DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** To (8,8) - ENEMY HEAD! If he stays or moves into it, head-on collision. If I move into his current head, I die. If he moves out and I move in, I might live. But RISKY! His head is literally at (8,8). Moving into his head is SUICIDE unless he vacates. But if he moves into (8,8) from elsewhere, we both die. Too dangerous. \u274c\n\n**SAFEST MOVE: DOWN to (7,7)**\n\n**WHY DOWN?**\n- Gives me breathing room.\n- Avoids immediate death.\n- Opens up path to (8,7) or (9,7) next turn if enemy moves.\n- I need to be alive to score more points! Dead snakes can't eat apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 20: Move DOWN to (7,7). Turn 21: Depending on enemy, either go RIGHT toward (8,7) or DOWN toward (7,6) to flank him. Watch enemy head movement\u2014if he goes UP to (8,9), I can chase apples at (6,6) or (5,9). If he stays aggressive, I'll circle around and box him in from below.

Multiple follow-ups (back to 8,8 or to 9,9).

Dead move. \u274c\n\nOpponent at (7,8) is heavily constrained: UP (7,9) and LEFT (6,8) are blocked by their own body, so their only legal moves are RIGHT -> (8,8) or DOWN -> (7,7). That gives us predictability this turn.\n\nWhy UP:\n- It\u2019s safe against both of their likely moves. If they go RIGHT into our current cell or DOWN, neither causes an immediate head-on into (8,9).\n- Keeps more escape options next turn (can pivot back to 8,8 or swing to 9,9).\n- Avoids walking directly into the enemy head or squeezing against the wall where they can trap us.\n- We\u2019re up 9\u20138 \u2014 stay aggressive but don\u2019t throw the game on a risky swap/head clash this turn. Force head-ons later when we can ensure it kills them or favors us.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Hold the top-right corridor, lengthen safely, and bait them downward into tighter lanes.\n- If they keep approaching and we clearly have the length/advantage, start forcing more direct confrontations.\n- Avoid moving into cells adjacent to both of their body segments where they can box us quickly.\n\nLET\u2019S BAIT \u2019EM AND STAY ALIVE \u2014 UP\n\nUP",

Let's analyze the board like a PRO. \ud83d\udc80\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (7,7) \u2014 I moved DOWN last turn, good call. Safe spot.\n- **My Body:** [(7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8)] \u2014 All behind me, blocking my path UP and LEFT.\n- **Enemy Head:** (8,9) \u2014 He's at the top-right corner, body stretching down to (8,2). Apples: 9.\n- **Enemy Body:** [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)] \u2014 His body is mostly on the right side, but he's at (8,9), which is vulnerable.\n\n**MOVES FROM (7,7):**\n1. **UP:** To (7,8) \u2014 MY BODY! DEAD. \u274c (No brain cells lost here.)\n2. **DOWN:** To (7,6) \u2014 Empty ('.'). Safe! From there, I can go DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6), or RIGHT to (8,6). (But RIGHT to (8,6) is enemy body? Wait, enemy body at (8,6). So that's DANGER if I go to (8,6) \u2014 I'd die. But from (7,6), RIGHT is (8,6) which is enemy body, so I can't go there. But moving to (7,6) itself is safe.) \u2705\n3. **LEFT:** To (6,7) \u2014 Empty ('.'). Safe! From there, I can go UP to (6,8) (my body), DOWN to (6,6), or LEFT to (5,7). (UP is blocked, but other options.) \u2705\n4. **RIGHT:** To (8,7) \u2014 Empty? Board shows (8,7) is enemy body? Let's check enemy body: [(8,8), (8,7), ...]. Yes, (8,7) is enemy body. So moving RIGHT into enemy body = DEAD. \u274c\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN (to (7,6)) or LEFT (to (6,7)).\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\n- **Enemy's Position:** Snake #0 is at (8,9), which is a corner. He might move DOWN to (8,8) (his body) or LEFT to (7,9) (empty? Board shows (7,9) is my body? Actually, (7,9) is my body: my body list has (7,9) as second element. So (7,9) is occupied by me. So if he moves LEFT to (7,9), he hits my body \u2014 HE DIES! That's a chance to eliminate him! But he might not do that. He could move DOWN to (8,8) which is his own body \u2014 he'd die. Or RIGHT to (9,9) which is empty? Board shows (9,9) is 'T'? Actually, (9,9) is 'T' in the board, but 'T' might be terrain? No, wait: the board uses 'T' for snake bodies? Let's check: In the board, '1' is my head, '0' is enemy head, 'T' is snake bodies (both snakes). So (9,9) is 'T', meaning some snake body is there. From enemy body list, (9,9) isn't listed; but (9,6) is. Hmm, board might be simplified. I'll assume (9,9) is occupied by some body (maybe mine? My body doesn't include (9,9)). Actually, my body: (7,8),(7,9),(6,9)... (6,9) is there, but (9,9) isn't mine. Enemy body doesn't include (9,9). Might be a mistake. I'll trust the board: (9,9) is 'T' = occupied. So (9,9) is not safe for enemy to move into. So his options from (8,9): UP to (8,10) off-board -> dead; DOWN to (8,8) his body -> dead; LEFT to (7,9) my body -> dead; RIGHT to (9,9) occupied -> dead. So actually, Snake #0 is in a CHECKMATE position! He has NO safe moves! Whatever he does, he dies this turn! That's HUGE! But I need to ensure I survive to capitalize.\n\n- **My Move Goal:** I need to stay alive and be in position to eat apples next turn or block him. Since he might die anyway, I just need to not die. Also, if he dies and I live, I win immediately (since I'm the only snake left). So priority: survive.\n\n- **Comparing SAFE moves:**\n  - **DOWN to (7,6):** Empty. From there, I can go DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6), or RIGHT to (8,6) but (8,6) is enemy body so dangerous. (7,5) is empty (board shows (7,5) is 'A'? Actually, (7,5) is 'A' in the list: (7,5) is an apple! Wait, apple drops include (7,5). Yes! So (7,5) has an apple. From (7,6), I can go DOWN to (7,5) to eat an apple. That's good! Also, from (7,6), LEFT to (6,6) which is an apple? (6,6) is 'A' in board and in apple list. So two apples near (7,6). This opens up scoring.\n  - **LEFT to (6,7):** Empty. From there, I can go DOWN to (6,6) (apple), LEFT to (5,7) (empty? board shows (5,7) is '.'), or UP to (6,8) (my body). So similar options, but (6,6) is also an apple.\n\nBoth moves are safe and give access to apples. But DOWN to (7,6) gets me closer to (7,5) apple and also keeps me away from the right side where enemy is. If enemy dies (likely), I can then freely go for apples. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** If enemy dies this turn (likely from his corner), I win immediately. But if by some miracle he survives, I need to be ready to chase him. By moving DOWN to (7,6), I position myself to eat the (7,5) apple next turn, gaining a point and tying 9-9. Then I can go for (6,6) or other apples. I need to dominate the board and force a collision if I get the lead.\n\n**LET'S GOOO CHAT!** I'm choosing **DOWN** to secure my survival and set up for an apple feast. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

He's gonna crash out unless he pulls a miracle, but I gotta play this safe and set up for the WIN. Let's break it down like a chess grandmaster.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (7,6) \u2014 Just moved here last turn. Solid position.\n- **My Body:** [(7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)] \u2014 Body is blocking my UP and LEFT from the head. But from (7,6), I'm clear to move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (but RIGHT to (8,6) is enemy body, so that's a death trap).\n- **Enemy Head:** (9,9) \u2014 Wait, hold up! I need to double-check the enemy head from the board state. The board shows the top-right corner (9,9) as '0'? Actually, looking at the board again: The row y=9 shows \"A . . . . . A T T T 0\" \u2014 the last cell (9,9) is '0', meaning the enemy head is AT (9,9). Yes! So Snake #0 is at (9,9). His body extends from (8,9) down to (8,2). So he's in the corner.\n- **Enemy Body:** From (9,9), his only possible moves are: UP (off-board, dead), LEFT to (8,9) which is HIS OWN BODY (dead), DOWN to (9,8) which is empty? Wait, (9,8) is 'T' in the board, meaning it's occupied by some snake body. Actually, looking at enemy body list: it includes (9,6), (9,5), (9,4) but not (9,8) or (9,9). However, the board marks (9,8) as 'T' \u2014 so there's a snake body there. Whose body is it? My body doesn't reach there. It might be his own body? Actually, his body list doesn't show (9,8) either. Hmm, maybe the board is just marking (9,8) as occupied by his body segment from earlier? I'll assume (9,8) is occupied by his body (since he's a long snake). So from (9,9), moving DOWN to (9,8) is into his own body \u2014 dead. Moving RIGHT is off-board \u2014 dead. So indeed, he has NO safe moves. He will die this turn unless he has a miracle play (like if his body isn't actually blocking (9,8) and it's empty, but the board says 'T', so I'll trust it's occupied). Therefore, Snake #0 is DOOMED. But I must survive to win!\n\n**MOVES FROM (7,6):**\n1. **UP:** To (7,7) \u2014 MY BODY! (7,7) is the first segment of my body list. DEAD. \u274c\n2. **DOWN:** To (7,5) \u2014 Board shows (7,5) is 'A' (apple) in the apple drops. Safe! No snake body there. \u2705\n3. **LEFT:** To (6,6) \u2014 Board shows (6,6) is 'A' (apple). Safe! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT:** To (8,6) \u2014 Board shows (8,6) is 'T' (enemy body). DEAD. \u274c\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN (to apple) or LEFT (to apple).\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- Both moves are safe and lead to eating an apple, which would tie the score at 9-9. That's huge because if the enemy dies this turn (likely), and I eat an apple, I'll be at 9 apples, and the enemy will be dead. But wait: if the enemy dies this turn, the game ends immediately with me as the only survivor, and I win regardless of apples. However, I need to confirm that my move doesn't cause me to die in some edge case (e.g., if the enemy somehow survives and I'm in a bad spot). But since he's in a corner with no moves, he's toast.\n- **DOWN to (7,5):** From (7,5), I can go DOWN to (7,4) (empty? board shows (7,4) is 'A' actually? Apple drops include (7,4). So that's another apple! Or LEFT to (6,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (8,5) (empty? board shows (8,5) is 'T' \u2014 enemy body). So DOWN gives me two apple options next turn. Also, moving DOWN moves me away from the right side where the enemy was, which is smart.\n- **LEFT to (6,6):** From (6,6), I can go LEFT to (5,6) (empty? board shows (5,6) is '.'), DOWN to (6,5) (apple), or RIGHT to (7,6) (where I just came from, but that's moving backwards into my own tail? Actually, (7,6) is my head's previous position, but it will be empty after I move? Wait, when I move, my tail might move if I didn't eat. But if I eat an apple, I grow, so my tail stays. However, moving RIGHT from (6,6) to (7,6) is not directly backwards into my body; it's just moving to the cell I just left. That's allowed. So from (6,6), I have options: LEFT to (5,6), DOWN to (6,5) apple, or RIGHT to (7,6) (which might be empty after I move, but it could be occupied by my body? Actually, my body after moving to (6,6) would be: new head (6,6), then old head (7,6) becomes body, etc. So (7,6) would be part of my body next turn. So moving RIGHT from (6,6) to (7,6) would be into my own body \u2014 dead. So from (6,6), RIGHT is dangerous. So LEFT move gives me fewer good options next turn compared to DOWN.\n\n- **COMPARISON:** DOWN to (7,5) seems slightly better because it opens up two apple moves next turn (DOWN to (7,4) and LEFT to (6,5)), while LEFT to (6,6) gives me one apple move (DOWN to (6,5)) and a dead-end option (RIGHT to (7,6) into my body). Also, (7,5) is closer to the center of the board, giving more flexibility.\n\n- **ENEMY SURVIVAL CHANCE:** Extremely low. He has no safe moves. Even if he miraculously has a safe move (maybe (9,8) is not his body?), it's still a corner trap. I should proceed as if he's dead, but play safe.\n\n- **LONG-TERM PLAN:** If enemy dies this turn (likely), I win immediately. But if he survives (unlikely), I need to be positioned to chase him. Moving DOWN to (7,5) gives me control of the lower middle area, with easy access to apples at (7,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc. I'll aim to eat apples and grow my score, but if I get the lead, I might force a head-on collision later. For now, survival and growth are key.\n\n**LET'S GOOO CHAT!** I'm choosing **DOWN** to eat that apple at (7,5), tie the score, and set up for more apples next turn. The enemy is trapped, and I'm about to take the crown! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

But let's cut the chatter and analyze the battlefield like a champ. \n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**  \n- **My Head:** (7,5) \u2014 Just moved here last turn, ate an apple.  \n- **My Body:** [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)] \u2014 Body blocks UP from (7,5) to (7,6), and LEFT to (6,5) is empty, DOWN to (7,4) is empty, RIGHT to (8,5) is enemy body (enemy snake #0's body).  \n- **Enemy Head:** (9,8) \u2014 Wait, the board shows (9,8) as 'T'? Actually, from the board state, row 8 (y=8) has \"A . . T T T T T T 0\" \u2014 so (9,8) is 'T' (enemy body), but the enemy head is listed as (9,8) in the opponent info? Hold up, let's check: Opponent says \"Snake #0 - Head: (9,8), Body: [(9,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4)]\". So the head is at (9,8), and (9,9) is part of his body? That means (9,8) is empty? But the board marks it as 'T'\u2014maybe a typo in the board? I'll trust the opponent info: head is (9,8), body includes (9,9). So (9,8) is empty.  \n- **Enemy's Situation:** He's in the top-right corner. From (9,8), his possible moves: UP to (9,9) \u2014 his own body (dead), LEFT to (8,8) \u2014 his own body (dead), RIGHT off-board (dead), DOWN to (9,7) \u2014 board shows (9,7) as 'T' (enemy body, since his body includes (9,6), (9,5), etc., but (9,7) is listed? Actually, his body list doesn't include (9,7), but the board marks it as 'T'. Likely occupied by his body. So he has NO safe moves\u2014he's doomed this turn! But I need to play as if he might survive somehow (miracles happen), so I must stay safe.  \n- **Apple Positions:** Apples at (0,8), (6,5), (0,6), (6,1), (0,9), (6,6), (5,9), (0,1), (6,0), (5,1), (2,1), (9,3), (3,1), (7,4), (9,1). From my position, reachable apples: (7,4) DOWN, (6,5) LEFT, (6,6) LEFT/UP, (5,9) far but accessible.  \n- **Score:** We're tied at 9-9. If enemy dies this turn, I win immediately. But if he survives (unlikely), I need to be positioned to chase him down.  \n\n**MOVES FROM (7,5):**  \n1. **UP:** To (7,6) \u2014 MY BODY! (7,6) is the first segment of my body. DEAD. \u274c  \n2. **DOWN:** To (7,4) \u2014 Board shows (7,4) is an apple (from apple drops). Safe! No snake bodies there. \u2705  \n3. **LEFT:** To (6,5) \u2014 Board shows (6,5) is an apple. Safe! \u2705  \n4. **RIGHT:** To (8,5) \u2014 Board shows (8,5) is 'T' (enemy body). DEAD. \u274c  \n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN to (7,4) or LEFT to (6,5). Both are apples!  \n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**  \n- **DOWN to (7,4):** Eat an apple at (7,4)! That would put me at 10 apples (if I eat it), giving me a lead over the enemy. From (7,4), I can go LEFT to (6,4) (empty), DOWN to (7,3) (empty), or RIGHT to (8,4) \u2014 but (8,4) is enemy body (from his body list). So LEFT and DOWN are open. This move also moves me away from the right side where the enemy might be (though he's likely dead).  \n- **LEFT to (6,5):** Eat an apple at (6,5)! Also ties or leads if enemy dies. From (6,5), I can go DOWN to (6,4) (empty), LEFT to (5,5) (empty), or RIGHT to (7,5) \u2014 which is where I came from, but after moving, (7,5) will be my body (since I ate, I grow). So RIGHT is into my own body\u2014dead. So LEFT gives me two good options (DOWN or LEFT), while RIGHT is a trap.  \n- **Comparison:** Both moves eat an apple and are safe. DOWN gives me access to (7,3) and (6,4), which are central and open. LEFT gives me (5,5) and (6,4), which are also open. However, DOWN moves me slightly downward, away from the top-right chaos, which might be safer if the enemy somehow survives and tries to flank me. Also, (7,4) is closer to (6,4) and (7,3), which are empty and could be stepping stones to other apples.  \n- **Enemy's Fate:** He's trapped! From (9,8), all moves are into his own body or off-board. He will almost certainly die this turn. If he dies, I win immediately regardless of my move. But I must play safe anyway.  \n- **Long-Term Plan:** If enemy dies, I win\u2014no need to plan. If he survives (miracle), I'll be at 10 apples and can chase him down. Moving DOWN sets me up to control the lower board, with easy access to apples at (6,4), (7,3), and (6,5) if I want to circle back. I'll avoid the right side where his body might linger.  \n\n**LET'S GOOO CHAT!** I'm choosing **DOWN** to eat that apple at (7,4), take the lead to 10-9, and set up for more apples. The enemy is on his last breath\u2014time to secure the W! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d  \n\nDOWN",

If they drift left or up, begin spiraling left across rows 6\u20134 to reduce their horizontal escape.

But let's cut the hype and break down the board like a true strategist.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**  \n- **My Head:** (7,4) \u2014 Just moved here last turn, ate an apple.  \n- **My Body:** [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)] \u2014 Body blocks UP from (7,4) to (7,5), and LEFT to (6,4) is empty, DOWN to (7,3) is empty, RIGHT to (8,4) is enemy body (enemy snake #0's body).  \n- **Enemy Head:** (9,7) \u2014 From the board, row 7 shows (9,7) as 'T' (enemy body). The opponent info says head at (9,7) but body includes (9,6), (9,5), etc. Actually, looking at board row 7: \". . . . . . . T T 0\" \u2014 (7,8) and (7,9) are 'T', and (9,7) is '0'? Wait, no: the board is indexed 0 to 9 left to right. Row 7 (y=7): positions: 0: '.', 1: '.', 2: '.', 3: '.', 4: '.', 5: '.', 6: '.', 7: 'T', 8: 'T', 9: '0'. So (9,7) is actually the last entry, which is '0'\u2014the enemy head is at (9,7)! That means (9,7) is occupied by enemy head, not body. But earlier, the opponent info listed head at (9,8) last turn? Hmm, there's inconsistency. I'll trust the board state: (9,7) is enemy head, and it's marked as '0'. So (9,7) is occupied by enemy.  \n- **Enemy's Situation:** From (9,7), his possible moves: UP to (9,8) \u2014 board shows (9,8) as 'T' (his own body, since his body includes (9,8)? Actually, last turn his head was at (9,8), so now it's part of his body. So UP is into his own body\u2014dead. LEFT to (8,7) \u2014 board shows (8,7) as 'T' (enemy body). RIGHT off-board\u2014dead. DOWN to (9,6) \u2014 board shows (9,6) as 'T' (his own body). So he has NO safe moves\u2014he's doomed this turn! But I must play as if he might survive (maybe he eats an apple and grows, but he can't move safely).  \n- **Apples:** Apples at (0,8), (6,5), (0,6), (6,1), (0,9), (6,6), (5,9), (0,1), (6,0), (5,1), (2,1), (9,3), (3,1), (9,1). From (7,4), I can reach (6,5) LEFT and UP, (6,6) LEFT and UP, (5,9) far, (7,3) DOWN (but no apple there).  \n- **Score:** I'm leading 10-9. If enemy dies this turn, I win. But if he survives (unlikely), I need to stay safe.\n\n**MOVES FROM (7,4):**  \n1. **UP:** To (7,5) \u2014 MY BODY! (7,5) is part of my body. DEAD. \u274c  \n2. **DOWN:** To (7,3) \u2014 Board shows (7,3) as empty ('.'). Safe! \u2705  \n3. **LEFT:** To (6,4) \u2014 Board shows (6,4) as empty ('.'). Safe! \u2705  \n4. **RIGHT:** To (8,4) \u2014 Board shows (8,4) as 'T' (enemy body). DEAD. \u274c  \n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN to (7,3) or LEFT to (6,4).\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**  \n- **DOWN to (7,3):** No apple here, but safe and opens up more space. From (7,3), I can go DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), or RIGHT to (8,3) \u2014 but (8,3) might be empty? Board row 3: (8,3) is '.' (since row 3: \". . . . . A . . . A\"). So three safe follow-up moves! This moves me away from the enemy side (right) and toward the lower board, where apples at (6,1), (6,0), (5,1) are accessible.  \n- **LEFT to (6,4):** Also no apple, but safe. From (6,4), I can go UP to (6,5) (apple there!), DOWN to (6,3) (empty), or LEFT to (5,4) (empty). So three safe follow-up moves too, and UP gets me an apple. This moves me toward the center-left, where apples are plentiful.  \n- **Comparison:** Both are safe with multiple options. LEFT gives me immediate access to an apple at (6,5) on the next turn if I want it. DOWN is more conservative, keeping me farther from the enemy's potential spawn point (if he survives). But since enemy is likely dead, LEFT might be better to grab more apples and dominate. However, I need to avoid head-on collisions. Enemy head at (9,7) will likely move? But he has no safe moves, so he dies. Still, if he somehow moves DOWN to (9,6) into his own body, he dies. I'll play safe.  \n- **Long-Term Plan:** If enemy dies, I win\u2014no need to plan. If he survives (miracle), I'm at 10 apples and can chase him down. Moving LEFT to (6,4) sets me up to eat (6,5) next turn, then possibly (6,6), dominating the left side. I'll avoid the right where enemy bodies linger. Focus on apples to grow and maintain lead.  \n\n**LET'S GOOO CHAT!** I'm choosing **LEFT** to position myself for future apple grabs and keep options open. The enemy is cooked\u2014time to secure the W! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",
