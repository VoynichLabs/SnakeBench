It is closer to the apple at (5,2) and (4,9). Since the enemy snake is moving simultaneously, I must consider that the enemy is at (4,4) and could move Left to (3,4) or Right to (5,4), or stay, or move Up/Down. My move to (4,3) is not into the enemy's current body or head.\n- **RIGHT (5,2):** This cell contains an apple. Moving here collects the apple (score +1). It is not off the board, and it is not occupied by my body or the enemy (enemy is at (4,4), body empty). This is a valid move that allows growth.\n- **LEFT (3,2):** This cell is empty. It is safe from immediate collision.\n- **DOWN (4,1):** This cell is empty. It is safe from immediate collision.\n\nAmong the safe moves, **RIGHT** is the most strategic because it immediately collects an apple, which is the primary objective to score points and grow. The other moves do not yield immediate points. The board is relatively open, so collecting an apple now is a high-value action. I will choose RIGHT.\n\nPlan for next turn: After moving to (5,2), I will have a body segment at (4,2). I should look for the next closest apple, perhaps at (3,2) (if I moved Left/Right) or (6,7), but specifically I will check the board state again.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "The board shows my snake at head (5,2), body [(4,2)], and the enemy snake at (4,5). My head is at (5,2). The apple at (5,2) is on my head, so I am currently on it? Wait, the board state shows \"1\" at (5,2) (head) and no apple there. The apple list includes (5,2)? No, the apple list has (8,0), (7,0), etc., but not (5,2). Actually, check the apples: (9,3), (8,8), (8,3), (6,8), (4,9), (2,5), (1,1), (3,7), (9,8), (1,7), (8,0), (7,0), (1,6), (6,7), (3,2). (5,2) is not an apple. My last move rationale mentioned apple at (5,2), but that seems incorrect based on the list. The board shows \"1\" at (5,2) and \"A\" at (4,2) in row 2? Let's parse the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\nRow 8: . . . . . . A . A A\nRow 7: . A . A . . A . . .\nRow 6: . A . . . . . . . .\nRow 5: . . A . 0 . . . . .\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A A\nRow 2: . . . A T 1 . . . .\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . .\nRow 0: . . . . . . . A A .\n\nCoordinates: (x,y) with y from bottom 0 to top 9.\n(5,2): row 2, column 5. In row 2 string: \". . . A T 1 . . . .\" That's columns 0-9: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 'A', col4 'T', col5 '1', col6 '.', col7 '.', col8 '.', col9 '.'. So at (5,2) is '1' (my head). At (4,2) is 'T' (tail). So my body is just (4,2). At (3,2) is 'A' (apple). So there is an apple at (3,2), not (5,2). My last move rationale mistakenly said apple at (5,2). I must correct.\n\nApples include (3,2) from list? Yes, (3,2) is in the apple list. So apple at (3,2) is directly left of my head.\n\nNow enemy snake #0: head at (4,5). Body none.\n\nTurn 1/150. I have 1 apple, enemy 0.\n\nI need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFirst, check immediate death moves:\n- UP: (5,3). Board row 3: \". . . . . . . . A A\" at columns? Row 3 string: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 '.', col5 '.', col6 '.', col7 '.', col8 'A', col9 'A'. So (5,3) is '.' empty. Not off board. Not my body (body at (4,2)). Not enemy body (enemy head at (4,5), body none). So UP is safe immediate.\n- DOWN: (5,1). Row 1: \". A . . . . . . . .\" col5 is '.'? Row 1: col0 '.', col1 'A', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 '.', col5 '.', col6 '.', col7 '.', col8 '.', col9 '.'. So (5,1) is '.' empty. Safe immediate.\n- LEFT: (3,2). That's an apple. Board shows 'A' at (3,2). So moving LEFT onto apple. Safe immediate? Check if any snake body there: my body is (4,2), so not (3,2). Enemy body none. So safe. Collecting apple gives +1 apple, grows tail later.\n- RIGHT: (6,2). Row 2 col6 is '.' empty. Safe immediate.\n\nAll four moves are safe from immediate collision.\n\nNow consider future: after move, enemy will also move. Enemy head at (4,5). Possible enemy moves: UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4), LEFT (3,5), RIGHT (5,5). Need to avoid head-on collisions and plan.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3,2) and collect apple, I grow. My new head at (3,2), body: [(4,2), (5,2)? Wait, after moving, my old head (5,2) becomes body, and tail (4,2) might shift if I grow? Actually, when I eat an apple, I grow: the tail does not move forward, so my body becomes longer by one segment. Currently body is only one segment: tail at (4,2). If I move LEFT to (3,2) and eat apple, the new body will be: head (3,2), then old head (5,2) becomes body, and old tail (4,2) becomes second body? Actually, typical snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and tail moves to previous position of second segment. When eating, tail does not move (so length increases by 1). So after move LEFT: new head (3,2), body becomes [(5,2), (4,2)]? Wait, careful: Before move: head (5,2), body list [(4,2)] (only tail). When moving: new head (3,2). The old head (5,2) becomes first body segment. The old tail (4,2) becomes second body segment? But since we ate an apple, we don't remove the tail, so we add a segment. So the new body list is [ (5,2), (4,2) ]? Actually, the order: head-to-tail: first is head, then each subsequent. So after move: head (3,2), then the previous head (5,2) is now the first body segment, and the previous tail (4,2) is now the second body segment. So body becomes [(5,2), (4,2)]. But is that correct? Usually, the body is a list of positions from head to tail. So after moving without eating: head moves to new, body[0] becomes old head, body[1] becomes old body[0], etc. With eating, we add the old tail as a new segment? Actually, typical snake: when eating, the tail does not advance, so the body list grows by one. So new body list = [old_head] + old_body (since old_tail stays). Old body was [(4,2)], so new body becomes [(5,2), (4,2)]. That seems right. So after LEFT move, I will occupy (3,2) as head, and have body segments at (5,2) and (4,2). That means (5,2) becomes occupied by my body. That's fine.\n\nNow, if I move UP to (5,3), I don't eat apple. New head (5,3), body becomes [(5,2), (4,2)]? Actually, old head (5,2) becomes body, old tail (4,2) becomes second body. So body: [(5,2), (4,2)].\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nNow, consider enemy moves. Enemy at (4,5). If I move LEFT to (3,2), enemy might move to (3,5) or (5,5) or etc. Could enemy head come to (3,2)? Unlikely because (3,2) is far from (4,5) in one move (distance 3 in y, 1 in x). Not possible.\n\nIf I move UP to (5,3), enemy might move to (5,5) or (4,6) etc. Could enemy head come to (5,3)? From (4,5) to (5,3) is delta x=+1, delta y=-2, not allowed (only one step). So no.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,2), enemy might move to (5,5) etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,1), enemy might move to (4,4) etc.\n\nAll seem safe from immediate head-on.\n\nBut we must consider future turns and traps. My goal is to collect apples and outlast enemy. I have 1 apple, enemy 0. I should try to collect apples efficiently.\n\nApples near me: (3,2) is directly left, an apple. (4,9) is far. (6,7) is far. (8,8) etc. So the closest apple is (3,2). Moving LEFT gets me that apple immediately, increasing score to 2. That seems optimal.\n\nBut wait: The board shows (3,2) is an apple, and also (4,2) is my tail. So if I move LEFT, I eat apple and grow. That's good.\n\nWhat about the apple at (4,2)? No, (4,2) is my tail, not apple. Apples list includes (3,2) but not (4,2). So yes.\n\nIs there any risk in moving LEFT? After moving, my body will occupy (5,2) and (4,2). The enemy is at (4,5). No immediate collision.\n\nBut consider: If I move LEFT, I am moving towards the left edge. There is an apple at (3,2) and also at (2,5) and (1,1) etc. Might be okay.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,3) might position me better for other apples like (6,7) or (8,8). But (5,3) is empty, no apple. Delaying apple collection could allow enemy to catch up. Since I already have 1 apple, getting another quickly is good.\n\nEnemy has 0 apples, so I should secure more apples.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be planning to move towards apples too. There are apples at (4,9), (2,5), (1,1), etc. Enemy at (4,5) is close to (2,5) and (4,9). If I don't collect (3,2), enemy might not get it because it's far from enemy's path.\n\nBut (3,2) is very close to me, so I should take it.\n\nNow, is there any trap? If I move LEFT, I go to (3,2). From there, possible moves: UP (3,3), DOWN (3,1), RIGHT (4,2) but that's my body (tail). So moving RIGHT back to (4,2) would be into my own body, which would kill me. So after moving LEFT, I must avoid moving RIGHT. That's a restriction. But other moves are available: UP, DOWN, LEFT (to (2,2) which is empty? Row 2 col2 is '.'), so (2,2) is empty. So from (3,2), I have three safe directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT. That's good.\n\nIf I move UP to (5,3), from there I have more options? (5,3) neighbors: (5,4) empty? Row 4 col5 is '.'? Row 4: \". . . . . . . . . .\" so all empty. (5,4) empty. (6,3) empty, (4,3) empty. So from (5,3) I have 4 directions possibly safe except maybe later. But no immediate apple.\n\nGiven that the apple at (3,2) is available and easy, I should take it.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy snake might move towards me? Unlikely at this distance.\n\nBut consider: if I move LEFT, my new head (3,2) and body (5,2) and (4,2). The cell (4,2) is occupied by my tail. If enemy moves to (4,2) next turn? Enemy at (4,5) can move DOWN to (4,4), then DOWN to (4,3), then DOWN to (4,2) in three turns. Not immediate.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nNow, what about moving RIGHT? (6,2) is empty, no apple. That would not gain point. Not optimal.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,1) also no apple.\n\nMoving UP to (5,3) no apple.\n\nSo LEFT is the only move that gains an apple immediately.\n\nThus, I should choose LEFT.\n\nBut wait: The last move rationale said RIGHT, but that was incorrect because there was no apple at (5,2). I need to correct that.\n\nNow, for this turn, I will choose LEFT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board: row 2: \". . . A T 1 . . . .\" So (3,2) is 'A', (4,2) is 'T', (5,2) is '1'. Yes.\n\nApples list includes (3,2) indeed.\n\nSo LEFT is good.\n\nNow, also consider: If I move LEFT, I will collect the apple, and my tail will not move, so my body will be [(5,2), (4,2)]. That means (5,2) becomes body. That's fine.\n\nNow, think about enemy's possible move. Enemy at (4,5). If enemy moves DOWN to (4,4), then it's safe. If enemy moves LEFT to (3,5), that's also safe. If enemy moves UP to (4,6), etc. None affect me.\n\nSo I am safe.\n\nTherefore, my move is LEFT.\n\nI need to output only the word.\n\nSo final answer: LEFTLEFT",

          "rationale": "The board state shows the enemy snake's head at (2,5) and body at (3,5). My current head is at (3,2) with body segments at (4,2) and (5,2). I need to move immediately.\n\nLooking at the board state, the cell (3,2) (which is the cell I am currently standing on) is marked as '1 T' in the provided board diagram. In the previous move, I moved LEFT to (3,2). The board diagram typically shows the state after the move. However, the \"Your snake\" section lists Head: (3,2), Body: [(4,2), (5,2)]. This implies that (3,2) is the head, (4,2) is the neck, and (5,2) is the tail.\n\nWait, if I moved LEFT from (4,2) to (3,2), my body should be [(3,2), (4,2)] and the tail should be at (5,2) or move to (4,2) depending on growth. Since I ate an apple, I should have grown. The \"Your snake\" section shows Apples: 2, confirming I ate. The body list [(4,2), (5,2)] suggests the snake has not fully updated or I am interpreting the diagram's \"T\" location.\n\nLet's re-read the board state carefully.\nRow 2: ` . . . 1 T T . A . . `\nCoordinates: (2,0) is `.`.\n(2,1) is `.`.\n(2,2) is `.`.\n(2,3) is `1` (Head at (3,2)).\n(2,4) is `T` (Body at (4,2)).\n(2,5) is `T` (Body at (5,2)).\n\nThis matches the \"Your snake\" description: Head (3,2), Body [(4,2), (5,2)].\n\nNow I must decide my next move.\n\nPotential moves:\n1.  **UP**: Target (3,3). Is it free?\n    The board shows `(7,3)` is `A`, but `(3,3)` is at x=3, y=3.\n    Looking at Row 3 of the board: ` . . . . . . . . A A `\n    Index 3 (x=3) is `.` (empty). This is a valid move.\n2.  **DOWN**: Target (3,1).\n    Row 1: ` . A . . . . . . . . `\n    Index 3 is `.`. Valid move.\n3.  **LEFT**: Target (2,2).\n    Row 2: ` . . . 1 T T . A . . `\n    Index 2 is `.`. Valid move.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Target (4,2).\n    Row 2 Index 4 is `T`. This is my own body. **Invalid (Death)**.\n\nI must avoid moving into my own body.\n\nLet's evaluate the board state and enemy position.\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,5) with body at (3,5).\nCurrent position (3,2).\nIf I go **UP** to (3,3): I am moving towards the top of the board. I see apples at (3,7), (4,9), (6,8), (8,8), (9,8). This opens up the path to the upper section.\nIf I go **DOWN** to (3,1): I see an apple at (1,1) and (4,5). However, going down moves me away from the dense apple cluster in the upper right. Also, I need to be careful about the bottom edge (y=0). (3,0) is empty based on row 0, but I don't want to get trapped at the bottom.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (2,2): I see an apple at (1,1). This seems like a local move.\n\nLet's check constraints.\nI have 2 apples. Snake #0 has 1 apple. I am ahead.\nThe enemy is at (2,5). If I go UP to (3,3), I am at x=3. The enemy is at x=2.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (2,4), we are not colliding.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (2,4) and I move UP to (3,3), we are safe.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (3,5), that is its body, so it can't go there (unless it's growing, but the tail moves).\nActually, the enemy body is at (3,5). The enemy head is at (2,5).\nIf I go UP to (3,3), I am safe from immediate collision.\n\nLong-term strategy:\nI need to secure more apples to win or survive the 150 turns. The upper right quadrant has many apples: (6,7), (7,2) [wait, (7,2) is currently an apple, but I am at (3,2). Moving UP takes me away from (7,2) but closer to (6,7), (8,8), etc.]. Actually, (7,2) is an apple at x=7, y=2. I am at x=3, y=2. I could move RIGHT (invalid) or UP/DOWN/LEFT.\nIf I move UP, I can eventually loop around or head towards (6,7) or (8,8).\nIf I move DOWN, I am moving towards (1,1) and (4,5). (4,5) is an apple. (1,1) is an apple.\nThe path UP seems safer because the board is wider. The bottom row (y=0) has apples at (8,0) and (7,0), but that's far right. The left side has (1,1).\nThe enemy is at (2,5). If I move UP, I am moving towards the enemy's current Y-level (5) but at x=3 vs x=2.\nIf I move UP to (3,3), next turn I could go UP to (3,4) or RIGHT to (4,3) (is it empty? Row 3, Index 4 is `.`), or LEFT to (2,3).\nLet's check Row 3 again: ` . . . . . . . . A A `\nIndices 0-7 are empty (dots). Indices 8 and 9 are apples.\nSo (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) etc are all empty.\nThis provides high mobility.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3,1):\nRow 1: ` . A . . . . . . . . `\n(3,1) is empty.\nNext turn options: (3,0), (4,1), (2,1).\n(4,1) is empty. (2,1) is empty.\nBut (3,0) is the bottom wall.\nThis restricts movement more than moving UP.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,2):\nRow 2: ` . . . 1 T T . A . . `\n(2,2) is empty.\nNext turn options: (2,1), (2,3), (1,2).\n(1,2) is empty? Row 2 Index 1 is `.`. Yes.\n(2,3) is empty? Row 3 Index 2 is `.`. Yes.\nThis is also safe.\n\nHowever, the apples are mostly in the upper half and right half.\nMoving UP puts me on a clear row (Row 3 is almost empty) and moves me closer to the apple at (3,7) and the cluster at (8,8), (9,8).\nAlso, moving UP avoids the potential conflict with Snake #0 if it decides to move down.\nSnake #0 is at (2,5). If I stay at y=2, I am far away. If I move UP, I approach y=5.\nIs it risky to approach the enemy?\nIf I am at (3,3) and enemy is at (2,5), the Manhattan distance is 2+2=4.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (2,4), distance becomes 1+1=2.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (2,3), distance becomes 0. (Collision if I am at (3,3)).\nBut if I am at (3,3) and enemy is at (2,3), that is a head-on collision (if I move LEFT and it moves RIGHT) or intersection.\nWait, if enemy is at (2,5) and I am at (3,2).\nIf I move UP to (3,3) and enemy moves DOWN to (2,4), no collision.\nIf I move UP to (3,3) and enemy moves DOWN to (2,3), we are adjacent.\nIf I move UP to (3,3) and enemy moves RIGHT to (3,5), no collision.\nIf I move UP to (3,3) and enemy moves UP to (2,6), no collision.\nThe risk of immediate collision is low unless the enemy predicts my move perfectly and moves to intercept (3,3). Since the enemy is at (2,5), it cannot reach (3,3) in one turn (distance 3). So (3,3) is safe from the enemy's immediate move.\nWait, the enemy moves simultaneously. The enemy moves from (2,5).\nTarget (3,3) requires moving x+1, y-2. Impossible in one turn.\nSo (3,3) is safe from the enemy.\nIt is also safe from my own body (Row 3 is clear).\nIt is within bounds.\n\nWhat about (2,2) (Left)?\nIf I move LEFT to (2,2), I am at x=2, y=2.\nThe enemy is at (2,5).\nDistance is 3.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (2,4), distance is 2.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (2,3), distance is 1.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (2,2), distance is 0 (Collision).\nCan the enemy reach (2,2) in one turn? No, it needs to move 3 steps down. Impossible.\nSo (2,2) is also safe from the enemy.\n\nHowever, let's look at the board again.\nRow 2: ` . . . 1 T T . A . . `\nIndices: 0, 1, 2 are empty.\nIf I go LEFT to (2,2), I am at Index 2.\nMy body is currently at Index 3 (3,2), Index 4 (4,2), Index 5 (5,2).\nIf I move LEFT, my new body will be [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] and tail at (5,2) (or moving to 4,2 if I don't eat).\nActually, if I eat an apple, I grow.\nAre there apples at (2,2)? No.\nAre there apples at (3,3)? No.\nAre there apples at (3,1)? No.\n\nSo all 3 moves are safe and don't eat an apple immediately.\nWhich one sets me up best?\n\nPath UP (3,3):\nOpens up the row y=3. Row 3 is ` . . . . . . . . A A `.\nI can move freely left/right along row 3.\nI can access apples at (8,3) and (9,3) eventually.\nI can also move UP to y=4, 5, etc.\nThis gives me access to the cluster of apples at (6,7), (8,8), (4,9).\nThe top area has many apples: (9,3), (8,8), (8,3), (6,8), (4,9), (9,8).\nAlmost all apples are in the upper half or right half.\n\nPath LEFT (2,2):\nI am at x=2. Row 2 is empty until x=7 (where an apple is at (7,2)).\nI can move to (7,2) eventually.\n(7,2) is an apple.\nHowever, x=2 is closer to the left wall.\nIf I go LEFT to (2,2), I have an open path to (7,2).\nBut (7,2) is on the bottom half (y=2).\nThe apples at (8,8), (9,8) are far away.\nTo get there, I would need to cross the board.\n\nPath DOWN (3,1):\nRow 1 is ` . A . . . . . . . . `\nI see an apple at (1,1).\nI am at (3,1). (1,1) is 2 steps away.\nIf I go DOWN, I can get closer to (1,1) and (4,5).\n(4,5) is an apple.\nHowever, y=1 is close to the bottom wall (y=0).\nThis restricts vertical movement.\nAlso, the apple density at y=1 is lower than y=8 or y=7.\n\nComparison:\nUP is the most flexible. It moves me to a row (y=3) that is open horizontally and allows access to the rich upper area.\nLEFT is also flexible but commits me to the lower half for now, though I can turn up later.\nDOWN restricts me near the wall.\n\nStrategy Note:\nI am currently at (3,2). The enemy is at (2,5).\nMoving UP to (3,3) is safe and positions me to access the cluster of apples in the upper-right quadrant ((8,8), (9,8), (6,7)). Row 3 is largely empty, offering high mobility. Moving LEFT or DOWN would trap me near the edges or bottom, limiting future options.\n\nDecision:\nMove UP to (3,3).\n\nDouble check:\nHead (3,2) -> UP -> (3,3).\nIs (3,3) occupied?\nBy me: No. (3,2) is current head, (4,2), (5,2) are body.\nBy enemy: Enemy is at (2,5). (3,3) is not (2,5) or (3,5).\nIs it on the board? Yes (x=3, y=3).\nIs it moving backwards? My previous move was LEFT (from (4,2) to (3,2)). UP is not backwards relative to LEFT.\nIs it moving into a wall? No.\n\nUP.UP",

(4,9) is an Apple. (8,9) is empty.\n- **Row 8:** (2,8) is empty. (6,8) is Apple. (8,8) is Apple. (9,8) is Apple.\n- **Row 7:** (1,7) is Apple. (3,7) is Apple. (6,7) is Apple. (8,7) is empty.\n- **Row 6:** (1,6) is Apple. (2,6) is Enemy Head.\n- **Row 5:** (3,5) is Enemy Body. (4,5) is Apple.\n- **Row 4:** (3,4) is empty.\n- **Row 3:** (3,3) is Me. (7,3) is empty? (9,3) is Apple. (Let's verify Row 3: ` . . . . . . . . A A ` -> (8,3) and (9,3) are apples. (3,3)-(7,3) are empty).\n- **Row 2:** (3,2) is My Body. (7,2) is Apple.\n- **Row 1:** (1,1) is Apple.\n- **Row 0:** (7,0) and (8,0) are Apples.\n\n**Potential Moves from (3, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 4):**\n    - **Safety:** (3, 4) is empty. My body is at (3, 2) and (4, 2). Enemy is at (2, 6). No collision.\n    - **Pros:** Opens path to top-row apples (4,9) and upper-right cluster (8,8, 9,8).\n    - **Cons:** None immediate.\n    - **Viability:** High. Keeps me in the central lane.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 2):**\n    - **Safety:** (3, 2) is occupied by my own body (the segment currently at (3,2)). Moving here results in death.\n    - **Viability:** **Invalid.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 3):**\n    - **Safety:** (2, 3) is empty (Row 3: ` . . . `). Enemy is at (2, 6). My body is to the right. Safe.\n    - **Pros:** Moves towards the apple at (1, 1) via (2,2) or (2,1).\n    - **Cons:** Moves me towards the left edge (x=0), potentially limiting horizontal escape routes later if the enemy blocks the center.\n    - **Viability:** Moderate.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 3):**\n    - **Safety:** (4, 3) is empty (Row 3: ` . . . . . `). Safe.\n    - **Pros:** Moves towards the right-side apples (7,2), (8,3), (9,3) and the upper-right cluster. Keeps me in the center-right.\n    - **Cons:** None immediate.\n    - **Viability:** High.\n\n**Comparison & Strategy:**\n- **Avoiding Danger:** DOWN is immediately fatal.\n- **Accessing Resources:** The densest cluster of apples is in the upper right quadrant (6,8), (8,8), (9,8), (3,7), (6,7). Moving UP or RIGHT positions me to reach this cluster efficiently.\n- **Enemy Threat:** The enemy is currently at (2, 6). They are likely heading towards the apples at (1, 7), (1, 6), or (4, 5). They are on the left side of the board. Moving LEFT would bring me closer to the enemy's current lane. Moving RIGHT or UP keeps me on the opposite side or center, reducing the chance of immediate head-on collision.\n- **Future Flexibility:**\n    - Moving **UP** to (3, 4) keeps me centered. From (3, 4), I can go RIGHT, LEFT, or continue UP. This is very flexible.\n    - Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 3) moves me toward the right wall but offers a clear path to (7,2) and (8,3). From (4, 3), I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n**Decision:**\nI am currently at (3, 3). I have 2 apples; the enemy has 1. I need to grow.\nThe most valuable apples are clustered at the top. Moving **UP** to (3, 4) advances me toward that cluster (3,7, 4,9, 6,8, 8,8, 9,8) while maintaining central positioning. Moving RIGHT to (4, 3) is also good, but UP feels more aligned with the general density of the board and keeps me away from the left wall where the enemy is patrolling.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (3, 4) to approach the top-center. From there, navigate towards the apple cluster at (6,8) or (8,8), while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position to avoid interception.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "My current position is (3, 4). My body consists of (3, 3) and (3, 2). The enemy snake is at (1, 6) with body (2, 6) and (2, 5). Apples are at (4, 9), (3, 7), (6, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), and others.\n\nI need to evaluate my possible moves:\n- **UP to (3, 5)**:\n    - Is (3, 5) inside the board? Yes (x=3, y=5 is within 0-9).\n    - Is (3, 5) occupied by my body? No. My body is at (3, 3) and (3, 2).\n    - Is (3, 5) occupied by the enemy body? No. Enemy body is at (2, 6) and (2, 5).\n    - Wait, looking at the board state for Row 5: ` . . T . A . . . . . `\n    - The 'T' marks at (2, 5) and (3, 5). In standard snake notation, 'T' usually represents the tail.\n    - The enemy body is listed as [(2, 6), (2, 5)]. This implies the tail is at (2, 5).\n    - However, the board diagram shows 'T' at (3, 5).\n    - Let's look closer at the enemy body list: `Body: [(2, 6), (2, 5)]`.\n    - If the head is (1, 6) and the body is (2, 6) -> (2, 5), the previous body position of (2, 6) was likely (2, 5). But the list is head-to-tail: Head (1, 6), then (2, 6), then (2, 5). So the tail is (2, 5).\n    - Why is there a 'T' at (3, 5)? The board diagram ` . . T . A . . . . . ` corresponds to indices 0-9. Index 2 is 'T', Index 3 is '.', Index 4 is 'A'.\n    - Let's re-read the board state text carefully:\n      - Row 5: ` . . T . A . . . . . `\n      - Indices: 0 '.', 1 '.', 2 'T', 3 '.', 4 'A', 5 '.', ...\n      - This corresponds to coordinates (2, 5) and (4, 5).\n      - (4, 5) is listed as an apple. Correct.\n      - (2, 5) is 'T'. This matches the enemy tail (2, 5).\n      - Is there another 'T' at (3, 5)? No, the character at index 3 is '.'.\n      - So (3, 5) is empty.\n    - Is (3, 5) occupied by the enemy head? No, enemy head is (1, 6).\n    - Conclusion: (3, 5) is empty.\n    - Pros: Moves towards apples (3, 7), (4, 9). Keeps me centered.\n    - Cons: None immediate.\n\n- **DOWN to (3, 3)**:\n    - (3, 3) is occupied by my own body. I die.\n    - Invalid.\n\n- **LEFT to (2, 4)**:\n    - Is (2, 4) inside board? Yes.\n    - Is (2, 4) occupied by my body? No. My body is at (3, 3) and (3, 2).\n    - Is (2, 4) occupied by enemy body? Enemy body is at (2, 6) and (2, 5). (2, 4) is not in the list.\n    - Is (2, 4) occupied by enemy head? No, enemy head is (1, 6).\n    - Is (2, 4) an apple? No. Apples listed don't include (2, 4).\n    - Pros: Moves closer to (1, 1).\n    - Cons: Moves towards the left wall and closer to the enemy's lane.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4, 4)**:\n    - Is (4, 4) inside board? Yes.\n    - Is (4, 4) occupied by my body? No.\n    - Is (4, 4) occupied by enemy body? No.\n    - Is (4, 4) occupied by enemy head? No.\n    - Is (4, 4) an apple? No.\n    - Pros: Moves towards (4, 5) (apple) and the right-side apples.\n    - Cons: None immediate.\n\nAnalysis of Safety and Strategy:\nThe enemy is at (1, 6). The distance to (2, 4) is 2 units (Euclidean) or 3 steps (Manhattan). The enemy is unlikely to immediately hit me at (2, 4) unless it moves DOWN (to 1, 5) or RIGHT (to 2, 6) -> wait, (2, 6) is its body.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (1, 5), it stays away from (2, 4).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (1, 7), it goes for the apple at (1, 7).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (0, 6), it hits the wall.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 6), it hits its own body (assuming (2, 5) remains or shifts).\nActually, the enemy body is [(2, 6), (2, 5)]. If the head moves to (2, 6), it hits the body. So RIGHT is likely fatal for the enemy or they won't choose it.\nSo the enemy is likely moving UP or DOWN. Neither puts it at (2, 4) or (3, 5) or (4, 4).\n\nLet's look at apples.\nHigh value apples:\n(3, 7) - 3 units up from (3, 4).\n(4, 5) - 1 unit right, 1 unit up from (3, 4).\n(6, 8) - Far.\n(8, 8) - Far.\n(4, 9) - Far.\n\nIf I go UP to (3, 5):\nI am at (3, 5). Next turn I can go to (3, 6), (2, 5), or (4, 5).\n(2, 5) is the enemy tail (currently). It might be empty next turn if the enemy moves.\n(4, 5) is an apple.\n(3, 6) is empty (row 6: `. 0 T . . . . . . A` -> indices 0: ., 1: 0, 2: T, 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: ., 9: A).\nSo (3, 6) is safe.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4):\nI am at (4, 4). Next turn I can go to (4, 5) (Apple), (3, 4) (Current pos), (5, 4).\n(4, 5) is an apple. This is very attractive.\n(3, 4) is empty (my body moves).\n(5, 4) is empty.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4):\nI am at (2, 4). Next turn I can go to (2, 5) (Enemy tail), (1, 4), (3, 4).\n(2, 5) is currently occupied. Risky.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\nUP moves me towards the center column and the apple at (3, 7).\nRIGHT moves me towards the apple at (4, 5).\n(4, 5) is much closer (distance 2) than (3, 7) (distance 3).\n(4, 5) is also a single apple, while (3, 7) is surrounded by other apples (6, 7, 8, 8).\nHowever, securing an immediate apple is usually good for growth and length.\nThe enemy is at (1, 6). The apple at (1, 7) is near the enemy. The apple at (4, 5) is safer.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4), I can eat (4, 5) next turn.\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), I can eat (4, 5) by going RIGHT on the next turn (from (3, 5) to (4, 5)).\nWait, if I go UP to (3, 5), I am adjacent to (4, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4), I am adjacent to (4, 5).\nIn both cases, I can eat (4, 5) next turn.\n\nLet's look at the board state around (3, 4).\nUp: (3, 5) is empty.\nDown: (3, 3) is my body.\nLeft: (2, 4) is empty.\nRight: (4, 4) is empty.\n\nIs there a risk of being trapped?\nIf I go UP to (3, 5):\nFuture moves from (3, 5): (3, 6), (2, 5), (4, 5).\n(2, 5) is currently occupied by enemy tail.\n(4, 5) is an apple.\n(3, 6) is empty.\nThis is a good spot.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4):\nFuture moves from (4, 4): (4, 5) (Apple), (3, 4), (5, 4).\n(4, 5) is Apple.\n(3, 4) is empty.\n(5, 4) is empty.\nThis is also a good spot.\n\nWhich is better?\nThe apple at (4, 5) is a primary target.\nFrom (3, 4), moving UP puts me at (3, 5).\nFrom (3, 5), I can go RIGHT to (4, 5) next turn.\nFrom (3, 4), moving RIGHT puts me at (4, 4).\nFrom (4, 4), I can go UP to (4, 5) next turn.\n\nBoth paths lead to the apple in 2 moves (current turn + next turn).\nLet's look at the apples at (3, 7) and (6, 8).\n(3, 7) is at y=7.\nIf I move UP to (3, 5), I am on the path to (3, 7).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 4), I am deviating from the vertical column.\nThe cluster of apples in the upper right (6, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8) is very valuable.\nTo get there, I should move generally UP.\nMoving UP to (3, 5) aligns with the vertical approach to the upper cluster.\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 4) moves me to x=4, which is still good, but (3, 5) keeps my x coordinate closer to the center (x=3) while advancing y.\n\nWait, let's check the apple at (3, 7) specifically.\nRow 7: `.

A . . .`\nIndices: 1 (A), 3 (A), 6 (A).\nCoordinates: (1, 7), (3, 7), (6, 7).\n(3, 7) is very close to my current position (3, 4).\nDistance is 3 steps (y=4 to y=7).\nIf I go UP to (3, 5) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 7).\nI can eat (3, 7) in 2 turns (including this move).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4) -> (4, 5) [Apple] -> (3, 5) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 7).\nIt takes longer to reach (3, 7) from (4, 4).\n\nSo, prioritizing the closest apple (3, 7) suggests moving UP.\nHowever, (4, 5) is also very close (distance 2).\n(3, 7) is distance 3.\n(4, 5) is distance 2.\n(4, 5) is closer.\n\nLet's compare the safety of the path to (4, 5) vs (3, 7).\nPath to (4, 5) via UP: (3, 4) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 5).\n(3, 5) is empty.\n(4, 5) is apple.\nPath to (4, 5) via RIGHT: (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 5).\n(4, 4) is empty.\n(4, 5) is apple.\n\nPath to (3, 7) via UP: (3, 4) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 7).\n(3, 5) empty, (3, 6) empty, (3, 7) apple.\n\nIs there any immediate danger?\nThe enemy is at (1, 6).\nThe enemy body is at (2, 6) and (2, 5).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (1, 5), it is safe.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (1, 7), it eats the apple at (1, 7).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (0, 6), it hits the wall (dies).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 6), it hits its own body (dies).\nSo the enemy is likely moving UP or DOWN.\nNeither puts the enemy at (3, 5) or (4, 4) or (4, 5) or (3, 6).\nSo my moves seem safe from the enemy.\n\nLet's consider the board boundaries.\nI am at (3, 4).\nGoing UP to (3, 5) is safe.\nGoing RIGHT to (4, 4) is safe.\n\nStrategy: I need to eat apples to grow.\nThe cluster at (3, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (8, 8) is dense.\nThe apple at (4, 5) is a \"lone\" apple compared to the cluster, but it's the closest.\nEating (4, 5) gives me +1 length.\nEating (3, 7) gives me +1 length.\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), I am on the Y-axis line of the cluster (x=3).\nFrom (3, 5), I can see (3, 7) and (3, 6).\n(3, 6) is currently empty.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4), I am at x=4.\nFrom (4, 4), I can see (4, 5) (apple) and (4, 6) (empty).\nThe cluster is mainly at x=6, 8, 9.\nGetting to x=3 is better for the x=3, x=6 apples.\nGetting to x=4 is slightly closer to x=6 than x=3 is?\nx=3 -> x=6 is 3 steps. x=4 -> x=6 is 2 steps.\nBut x=3 -> x=3 (vertical) is 0 steps.\nThe apple at (3, 7) is very tempting because I am already aligned with it.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (8, 0) and (7, 0) at the bottom right.\nI am at (3, 4). These are far away. I can't reach them before the enemy or without traversing the whole board.\nI should focus on the top/right cluster.\n\nRe-evaluating UP vs RIGHT.\nIf I go UP to (3, 5):\nI can go to (3, 6) or (4, 5) next.\n(3, 6) is empty.\n(4, 5) is apple.\n(2, 5) is enemy tail (might move).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4):\nI can go to (4, 5) or (5, 4) or (3, 4).\n(4, 5) is apple.\n(3, 4) is empty.\n\nThe apple at (4, 5) is a \"safe\" apple. It's not surrounded by other apples, so the enemy might not be rushing for it. The enemy is at (1, 6) and apples at (1, 7) and (3, 7) are closer to the enemy horizontally.\nThe enemy is likely to go for (1, 7) or (3, 7).\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), I am contesting the (3, 7) apple path.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4), I am on a slightly different trajectory.\n\nHowever, the most important thing is to stay alive and grow.\nUP to (3, 5) keeps me centered.\nRIGHT to (4, 4) moves me slightly right.\nThe center (x=3 to x=5) is usually the safest place to be to have escape routes.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4), I am still in the center.\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), I am in the center.\n\nLet's look at the \"tail\" of my snake.\nMy tail is at (3, 2).\nIf I move UP, the tail will move to (3, 3).\nIf I move RIGHT, the tail will move to (3, 3).\nIn both cases, the cell (3, 2) becomes empty.\nThis is relevant if I want to loop back, but I am moving away from it.\n\nIs there any advantage to moving LEFT to (2, 4)?\n(2, 4) is closer to the wall (x=0).\nBeing near the wall is generally bad because you have fewer escape routes.\nThe enemy is at x=1.\nIf I go to x=2, I am getting closer to the enemy.\nThe enemy is at y=6. I am at y=4.\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4), distance is sqrt((1-2)^2 + (6-4)^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) ~ 2.2.\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), distance is sqrt((1-3)^2 + (6-5)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5) ~ 2.2.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4), distance is sqrt((1-4)^2 + (6-4)^2) = sqrt(9 + 4) = sqrt(13) ~ 3.6.\nSo RIGHT puts me furthest from the enemy.\nUP puts me close to the enemy (same distance as LEFT).\nBut UP moves me towards the apples in the center/top.\nRIGHT moves me towards the apples on the right.\nThe apple at (4, 5) is very close.\nLet's prioritize the apple at (4, 5).\nTo get to (4, 5):\nFrom (3, 4): Move RIGHT to (4, 4) -> UP to (4, 5).\nFrom (3, 4): Move UP to (3, 5) -> RIGHT to (4, 5).\nBoth are valid.\nWhich starting move is better for *future* flexibility after eating (4, 5)?\n\nCase 1: Move RIGHT -> (4, 4). Eat (4, 5) next. Now at (4, 5).\nFrom (4, 5), possible moves: (4, 6), (3, 5), (5, 5).\n(4, 6) is empty (Row 6: `. 0 T . . . . . . A` -> indices 4 is .).\n(3, 5) is empty (Row 5: `. . T . A . . . . .` -> indices 3 is .).\n(5, 5) is empty (Row 5: index 5 is .).\nSo from (4, 5), I have 3 open moves (assuming I don't hit myself).\n\nCase 2: Move UP -> (3, 5). Eat (4, 5) next. Now at (4, 5).\nSame result as Case 1.\nWait, if I move UP to (3, 5), my body occupies (3, 4) and (3, 3).\nIf I then move RIGHT to (4, 5), my body will be at (4, 4) and (3, 4).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 4), my body will be at (3, 4) and (3, 3).\nIf I then move UP to (4, 5), my body will be at (4, 4) and (3, 4).\nThe resulting state after eating the apple is identical regarding the body positions (Head at 4,5, body at 4,4 and 3,4).\nSo, effectively, both UP and RIGHT lead to the same state in 2 turns (eating 4,5).\n\nHowever, the *intermediate* state differs.\nState after 1 turn:\n- If I go UP: Head (3, 5), Body [(3, 4), (3, 3)].\n- If I go RIGHT: Head (4, 4), Body [(3, 4), (3, 3)].\n\nWhich intermediate state is better?\n(3, 5) is on the path to (3, 7).\n(4, 4) is on the path to (6, 8).\n(3, 5) is closer to (3, 7) (2 steps).\n(4, 4) is closer to (6, 8) (2 steps in x, 4 in y).\nThe apple at (3, 7) is closer in Y distance.\nThe apple at (6, 8) is further.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(3, 7) is a good target.\n(6, 8) is a good target.\n(8, 8) is a good target.\n(4, 9) is a good target.\n\nIf I am at (3, 5), I can go to (3, 6) -> (3, 7).\nIf I am at (4, 4), I can go to (5, 4) -> (6, 4) ... this doesn't lead directly to the top cluster.\nTo reach the top cluster from (4, 4), I need to go UP eventually.\nFrom (3, 5), I am already going UP.\n\nThe \"top center\" apple (4, 9) is at x=4.\nIf I am at x=3, I need to go to x=4.\nIf I am at x=4, I am already at x=4.\nSo being at x=4 is slightly better for (4, 9).\nBut being at x=3 is better for (3, 7).\n(3, 7) is closer than (4, 9).\n(3, 7) is 3 steps away. (4, 9) is 5 steps away.\nI should target the closest apple first to grow and gain length advantage.\n(4, 5) is 2 steps away. (3, 7) is 3 steps away. (7, 2) is 4 steps away.\n(4, 5) is the closest.\nSo the plan is definitely to eat (4, 5).\nThe question is just which move to make *now*.\n\nLet's consider the enemy again.\nEnemy at (1, 6).\nIf I go UP to (3, 5):\nDistance to enemy is small.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4):\nDistance to enemy is larger.\nSafety wise, RIGHT is safer regarding the enemy.\nBut the enemy is occupied with apples at (1, 7) and (3, 7).\nIf the enemy goes for (1, 7), it moves UP.\nIf the enemy goes for (3, 7), it moves RIGHT (to 2, 6) -> wait, (2, 6) is its body.\nSo the enemy cannot go RIGHT to (2, 6).\nIf the enemy wants to go towards (3, 7), it must go UP first to (1, 7), then maybe RIGHT?\nOr it could go UP to (1, 7) and stay there.\nIf the enemy goes UP to (1, 7), it eats the apple there.\nThen the enemy body moves.\nThis might open up (2, 6).\nBut (2, 6) is not on my path to (4, 5) or (3, 7).\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 6: `. 0 T . . . . . . A`\nIndices: 0: ., 1: 0, 2: T, 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: ., 9: A.\n(3, 6) is empty.\n(4, 6) is empty.\n(5, 6) is empty.\n\nIf I go UP to (3, 5):\nI am at (3, 5).\nNext moves: (3, 6), (4, 5), (2, 5).\n(2, 5) is currently occupied by enemy tail T.\nIf the enemy moves, (2, 5) might become empty.\nBut it's risky to rely on the enemy moving away immediately.\nHowever, I have other options: (3, 6) and (4, 5).\nSo I am not forced to go to (2, 5).\nSo (3, 5) is safe.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4):\nI am at (4, 4).\nNext moves: (4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 4).\n(4, 5) is apple.\n(3, 4) is empty (my body moves away).\n(5, 4) is empty.\nAll options are safe.\n\nConclusion:\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe and lead to eating (4, 5) next turn.\nUP keeps me closer to the vertical cluster (3, 7).\nRIGHT keeps me slightly further from the enemy.\nThe apple at (3, 7) is surrounded by other apples (6, 7), (6, 8), (8, 8).\nThe area around (3, 7) is more valuable long-term than the area around (4, 5).\nBeing at x=3 (UP move) is better for accessing the x=3 apples.\nSo I will choose UP.\n\nWait, let's double check the enemy tail at (2, 5).\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), I am adjacent to (2, 5).\nIf the enemy stays still (impossible in Snake), or moves such that its tail stays at (2, 5), I am safe as long as I don't go to (2, 5).\nIf the enemy moves, (2, 5) becomes empty.\nSo (3, 5) is safe.\n\nIs there any risk of the enemy head moving to (3, 5)?\nEnemy is at (1, 6).\nTo get to (3, 5), it would need to move RIGHT (to 2, 6) and DOWN (to 2, 5).\nIn one turn, it can only move one step.\nFrom (1, 6), possible moves:\n- (1, 7) - Apple.\n- (1, 5) - Empty.\n- (0, 6) - Wall.\n- (2, 6) - Own body (blocked).\nThe enemy cannot reach (3, 5) in one turn.\nSo (3, 5) is safe from the enemy head.\n\nI will move UP. This positions me to go for (3, 7) or (4, 5) next turn.\n\nWait, I should verify the \"Backwards\" rule.\nMy head is at (3, 4).\nMy previous move was UP (from 3, 3 to 3, 4).\nMoving DOWN would be backwards into my body (3, 3).\nI am not moving DOWN.\nMoving UP is fine.\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT is fine.\nSo UP is valid.\n\nFinal check on coordinates.\n(3, 4) -> UP -> (3, 5).\n(3, 5) is inside 0-9.\n(3, 5) is empty.\nDecision: UP.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 4)**: Empty. Safe.\n    *   **UP (3, 5)**: Empty. Safe.\n\n5.  **Comparing Safe Moves (LEFT vs RIGHT vs UP)**:\n    *   **LEFT to (2, 4)**: This moves me closer to the enemy snake (currently at x=1-2, y=6-7). The enemy occupies the left side of the board. Moving left risks a head-on collision or being cut off. Not optimal.\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 4)**: This moves me toward the right side of the board. While safer from the enemy, the nearest apple is at (4, 5). From (4, 4), I can move to (4, 5) next turn. However, I would be at x=4, which is slightly off-center relative to the apple cluster at (3, 7).\n    *   **UP to (3, 5)**: This moves me directly up the board. From (3, 5), I am positioned to access the apple at (4, 5) (by moving RIGHT) or continue moving up toward the apple at (3, 7). (3, 7) is a high-value target because it is part of a dense cluster of apples at (3, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (8, 8), etc.\n\n6.  **Safety Check for UP (3, 5)**:\n    *   Is (3, 5) occupied by the enemy?\n        *   The enemy head is at (1, 7).\n        *   The enemy body is at (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 6).\n        *   (3, 5) is not in the enemy's body or head position.\n        *   The enemy cannot reach (3, 5) in one move from (1, 7) (it would take two moves: e.g., (1, 7) -> (2, 7) -> (3, 6) or similar).\n    *   Is (3, 5) occupied by myself?\n        *   My body is at (3, 3) and (3, 2).

Empty.\n\n3.  **Safety Evaluation (RIGHT vs UP)**:\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 6)**: This is a safe square empty of obstacles. However, looking at the enemy snake's position at (2, 7) with body extending to (2, 6) and (1, 6), they are positioned to potentially move East/South. If I move RIGHT to (4, 6), I am moving away from the immediate conflict zone at x=2-3.\n    *   **UP to (3, 7)**: This square contains an apple. It is empty of snakes. However, I must consider the enemy's potential moves. The enemy head is at (2, 7). They might move UP to (2, 8), RIGHT to (3, 7), or DOWN to (2, 6). If they move RIGHT to (3, 7) at the same time I move UP to (3, 7), we result in a head-on collision, and both snakes die. Given the current turn count (7) and scores (Enemy: 3, Me: 2), dying to a head-on collision is a disadvantageous trade because it ends the game immediately with the enemy having higher points (or a draw if tied, but currently they lead).\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision**:\n    *   The board has many apples. The cluster at (3, 7), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (8, 8), etc., is highly desirable.\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (4, 6) positions my head at x=4, y=6.\n    *   From (4, 6), I have access to apples at (4, 5), (6, 7), and (6, 8).\n    *   Crucially, moving RIGHT avoids the immediate head-on collision risk at (3, 7).\n    *   If I survive this turn by moving RIGHT, I can observe the enemy's move. If the enemy moves into (3, 7) or elsewhere, I will have gained valuable information and preserved my life.\n    *   Moving RIGHT also keeps my head centered on the board relative to the right-side apple cluster, which is currently less contested by the enemy (who is at x=2).\n\n5.  **Long-term Plan**:\n    *   Secure the right-side apple cluster (6,7), (6,8), (8,8), (8,7). Maintain distance from the enemy snake at x=2. Avoid risky head-on collisions early in the game while trailing in score.\n\nRIGHT",

The cluster at the top-right is valuable. The apple at (4, 5) is very close.\n\n2.  **Analyze Potential Moves**:\n    *   **UP (4, 7)**: This cell contains an apple (listed in the apple list). It is currently empty of snakes (Enemy is at (2, 8) and (2, 7), etc.).\n    *   **DOWN (4, 5)**: This cell contains an apple (listed in the apple list). It is empty of snakes (My body is at (3, 6) and (3, 5)). Note: (3, 5) is occupied, but (4, 5) is diagonal to it.\n    *   **LEFT (3, 6)**: This is currently occupied by my own body (the segment that was my head previously). Moving here would cause me to die. **INVALID**.\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 6)**: This cell appears empty based on the board visualization. No apple listed here.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Risks and Rewards**:\n    *   **UP to (4, 7)**:\n        *   **Reward**: Eats an apple (+1 point, grow).\n        *   **Risk**: Enemy is at (2, 8). Enemy could potentially move to (3, 8), (2, 7), or (2, 9). It is unlikely they will move to (4, 7) as it is far. If they move to (3, 8), we are adjacent but not colliding. If they move to (2, 7), they are safe.\n        *   **Future**: From (4, 7), I am closer to the top-right apple cluster (6,8), (8,8), etc. I also have access to (4, 8).\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 5)**:\n        *   **Reward**: Eats an apple (+1 point, grow).\n        *   **Risk**: Very low. Enemy is far away (x=2). My body is to the left at (3, 6) and (3, 5). (4, 5) is not occupied by my body.\n        *   **Future**: From (4, 5), I can move to (4, 4), (5, 5), or back to (4, 6). This puts me lower on the board, potentially moving away from the dense top-right apple cluster.\n\n4.  **Strategic Consideration**:\n    *   The enemy snake is at (2, 8). They are chasing apples at (9, 8), (8, 8), (3, 7).\n    *   My best route to high scores is the top-right cluster: (4, 7) -> (4, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (8, 8).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (4, 5), I am moving away from this cluster and giving the enemy a head start.\n    *   If I go UP to (4, 7), I am stepping on an apple and moving directly towards the cluster.\n    *   Is there a collision risk? The enemy head is at (2, 8). If they move RIGHT to (3, 8), they are safe. If they move UP to (2, 9), safe. If they move DOWN to (2, 7), safe.\n    *   Could the enemy move to (4, 7)? No, that's 2 steps away for them. They can only move to adjacent cells.\n    *   Therefore, **UP to (4, 7) is safe** and highly beneficial.\n\n5.  **Final Decision**:\n    *   Move UP to (4, 7).\n    *   This secures an apple immediately.\n    *   This positions me perfectly to challenge for the top-right apple cluster.\n    *   This keeps distance from the enemy snake at x=2.\n\nPlan: Secure (4, 7). Next turn, assess (4, 8) or (5, 7) to approach the (6,8) apple. Maintain distance from the enemy.\n\nUP",

They are 2 cells away (Manhattan distance). It is unlikely they will move into (5, 8) this turn (would require moving (2, 1) direction or specific pathing).\n    *   **Reward:** Moves me closer to apples at (6, 8) and (4, 9).\n    *   **Future:** From (5, 8), I can move to (6, 8) next turn to eat an apple.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe and proactive.\n\n2.  **DOWN (5, 6):**\n    *   Target cell is currently empty.\n    *   **Risk:** None immediate.\n    *   **Reward:** Moves me closer to apples at (4, 5) and (5, 5).\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, but moves me away from the cluster at (6, 8) and (6, 7).

The head is at (4, 9). The body extends down to (2, 7). The enemy is on the top row.\n*   **Board State:**\n    *   **Immediate Danger:** The enemy head is at (4, 9). I am at (6, 7).

(4, 6) is below that.\n    *   **Potential Moves:**\n        *   **UP (6, 8):** Contains an apple. Moving here puts me at (6, 8).\n            *   *Risk:* If the enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9) this turn, it won't hit me. If the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 8) or (4, 7)... (4, 7) is my body, so if the enemy hits it, the enemy dies. However, if the enemy moves into (6, 8), it would be a head-on collision (unlikely given distance). The main risk is if the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 8) and then I am at (6, 8), we are close.\n            *   *Reward:* Eat apple. Grow to length 5. Get closer to the cluster at (8,8), (9,8), (8,7).\n        *   **RIGHT (7, 7):** Currently empty (A at (7, 0) is far).

Less immediate score than UP.\n        *   **DOWN (6, 6):** Currently empty.\n            *   *Risk:* Moves me away from the top-right cluster where the enemy is.

The apple at (6, 8) is very close to the enemy. If I move UP to (6, 8), I am 2 tiles away from the enemy horizontally.\n    *   However, the enemy is likely to move DOWN (to access apples at (4, 8), (3, 7), etc.) or RIGHT (to go to (5, 9) or (6, 9)).\n    *   If I move UP to (6, 8) and eat the apple, I gain a point and grow.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 7), I give up the immediate apple but position myself more centrally on the right side.\n    *   Considering the \"Head-on collision\" rule: If I move UP to (6, 8) and the enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9), no collision. If the enemy moves UP to (4, 10), death (off board).\n    *   The apple at (6, 8) is valuable. I should take it. The enemy is currently above me, but there is no immediate \"enemy head is adjacent to where I want to be\" threat that would cause a mutual death. The enemy is at (4, 9) -> I want (6, 8).\n    *   Let's check the collision logic strictly.\n        *   My move: UP to (6, 8).\n        *   Enemy moves: Assume best case for enemy (DOWN to 4,8 or RIGHT to 5,9).\n        *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (4, 8): No collision with me at (6, 8).\n        *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9): No collision.\n        *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (4, 7): (4, 7) is my body. Enemy dies. I survive.\n        *   The only way I die is if Enemy moves into (6, 8). Is that possible?\n            *   Enemy at (4, 9). Target (6, 8).\n            *   Path 1: (5, 9) then (6, 8) (2 turns).\n            *   Path 2: (4, 8) then (5, 8) then (6, 8) (3 turns).\n            *   Path 3: (5, 8) then (6, 8) (2 turns).\n            *   It is impossible for the enemy to reach (6, 8) in a single move from (4, 9) because the distance is 3 (Manhattan: $|4-6| + |9-8| = 2+1=3$).\n        *   Therefore, moving UP to (6, 8) is safe from a head-on collision this turn.\n        *   Is it safe from running into my own body?\n            *   My body: (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6).\n            *   (6, 8) is not in my body.\n        *   Is it safe from running into enemy body?\n            *   Enemy body: (3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7).\n            *   (6, 8) is far from these.\n    *   Conclusion: UP is safe and scores a point.\n\n    *   Alternative: RIGHT to (7, 7).\n        *   Safe.\n        *   No apple.\n        *   Sets up future moves.\n    *   Comparing UP (scores point, grows) vs RIGHT (no point, position).\n    *   I should eat the apple. The lead is important (Enemy 4, Me 3). Getting to 4 apples ties the score.\n    *   I will move UP to (6, 8).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (6, 8) to eat the apple and tie the score 4-4. From (6, 8), I will have access to the right-side cluster (8,7), (8,8), (9,8). I must be careful not to get trapped against the wall if the enemy pushes down. If the enemy pushes down the left side (columns 0-5), I can dominate the right side (columns 6-9).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Since the enemy is at (4, 8) and I am at (6, 8), (5, 8) is the only cell between us.\n        *   Given the enemy is likely to push for apples or space, moving RIGHT is a plausible move for them.\n        *   **Consequence:** Moving LEFT carries a high risk of mutual death. Since the score is tied (4-4), dying results in a loss (or draw if we die simultaneously, but I prefer a win). I must avoid the head-on collision.\n    *   **Body Collision Risk:**\n        *   My body is at (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6).\n        *   Moving **DOWN** to (6, 7) would be moving directly into my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). This is suicide. **DOWN is invalid.**\n    *   **Valid Moves:**\n        *   **UP:** To (6, 9). This is inside the board.\n            *   *Safety:* (6, 9) is currently empty.\n            *   *Future:* Moves me closer to the top-right wall. While the wall restricts movement, I am not currently trapped. From (6, 9), I can descend down the right side.\n            *   *Apple Proximity:* (9, 8) and (8, 8) are accessible.\n        *   **RIGHT:** To (7, 8).\n            *   *Safety:* (7, 8) is currently empty.\n            *   *Future:* Moves me deeper into the right side, toward the cluster of apples at (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8). This seems like the most profitable long-term direction.\n            *   *Collision Check:* Enemy at (4, 8) cannot reach (7, 8) this turn (distance 3).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI must avoid the head-on collision with the enemy at (5, 8). Therefore, **LEFT is fatal**. **DOWN is fatal** (self-collision).\nI am left with UP and RIGHT.\n\n*   **Comparison of UP vs RIGHT:**\n    *   **UP (6, 9):** Puts me against the top wall. This reduces my future movement options to 2 or 3 (depending on left/right). If the enemy cuts me off later, I could be trapped.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 8):** Puts me in the center of the right side apple cluster.\n        *   Apples nearby: (8, 8), (9, 8), (8, 7).\n        *   This direction offers more space and more immediate scoring opportunities.\n        *   It also opens a path to the bottom-right apples ((7, 0), (8, 0)) if needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (7, 8) is the optimal move. It avoids the guaranteed collision risk of moving LEFT, avoids the suicide move DOWN, and positions my head in a resource-rich area of the board. I will ignore the top wall for now and secure the right-side cluster.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (7, 8) to secure the right side cluster. From there, I can target (8, 8) or (9, 8) next. I must keep the enemy contained on the left side and avoid letting it cross over to the right side near me.\n\nRIGHT",

My tail is moving from (4, 7) to (4, 8) (presuming the enemy doesn't block it, but the tail moves regardless of blocking, the new segment just isn't added).\n        *   **RIGHT (8, 8):** Currently empty. There is an apple at (8, 8).\n    *   **Enemy Movement Prediction:**\n        *   The enemy head at (5, 8) is aggressive.\n        *   If I move **UP**, I move away from the enemy.\n        *   If I move **DOWN**, I move closer to the enemy but into an empty space. The enemy might chase, but I am gaining distance from my tail.\n        *   If I move **RIGHT**, I move into the apple cluster.\n        *   The enemy is likely to target apples or position itself advantageously. The enemy is currently trapped on the left side by my body at (6, 8) and (6, 7). If I move away from (6, 8), I leave that corridor open.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n*   **UP (7, 9):** Moves me to the top wall. This reduces my future mobility and doesn't gain any immediate benefit (no apple). It is safe but passive.\n*   **DOWN (7, 7):** Moves me toward the bottom, closer to the enemy. While empty, it brings me closer to the enemy's potential path and doesn't immediately secure a resource.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 8):** This square contains an apple.\n    *   **Immediate Benefit:** Eating an apple increases my score (5-4 lead) and causes me to grow. My tail will not move next turn, effectively solidifying my body structure.\n    *   **Strategic Positioning:** I move deeper into the right-side apple cluster ((9, 8), (8, 7), (8, 0), etc.). This is the most resource-rich area.\n    *   **Safety:** (8, 8) is currently empty. I am moving away from the enemy (distance increases from 2 to 3).\n    *   **Blockade:** By eating the apple at (8, 8), I occupy a key position. If I stay at (8, 8) next turn (due to growth), I effectively block the top-right quadrant from the enemy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **RIGHT** is the superior move. It secures a point, grows my snake, moves me toward more apples, and positions me in a dominant area of the board. Moving UP or DOWN wastes the opportunity to score immediately while the path is clear.\n\n**Plan:**\nEat the apple at (8, 8) to take the lead and grow. From (8, 8), I will be positioned to target (9, 8) or descend the right side to secure the lower apples ((8, 7), (7, 0), etc.). I must continue to monitor the enemy's attempt to cross over or follow me.\n\nRIGHT",

Therefore, the enemy **must move RIGHT to (6, 9)**. This is a critical certainty.\n    *   **Head-on Collision Risk:** My head is at (8, 8). The enemy is at (5, 9) moving to (6, 9). The distance is large, and we are not on a collision course.\n    *   **Body Collision Check:**\n        *   **UP (8, 9):** Currently empty. Safe.\n        *   **DOWN (8, 7):** Currently contains an apple. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT (7, 8):** Currently occupied by my own body. Moving here would result in suicide. **Invalid.**\n        *   **RIGHT (9, 8):** Currently contains an apple. Safe.\n*   **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   I have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n    *   **UP (8, 9):** This leads to the top wall and clusters me against the boundary. While empty, it limits future mobility and moves me away from the dense apple clusters on the board ((8, 7), (7, 7), (9, 6), etc.).\n    *   **DOWN (8, 7):** This square contains an apple. Eating it would give me a point (6-4 lead) and cause me to grow. However, moving down puts me closer to the enemy's projected path (they are at (6, 9) and will likely try to descend the right side or cross over). It also puts me in the center of the board where paths are narrow.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 8):** This square contains an apple. Eating it gives me a point and causes me to grow. Crucially, this moves me to the far right edge, maximizing my distance from the enemy (currently at 5,9). Being on the edge reduces the directions I can be attacked from (only Left, Up, Down). It also places me directly next to another apple at (9, 6) and (9, 3), setting up a vertical harvest path.\n\n    *   **Comparison of Down vs. Right:** Both offer an immediate apple. However, RIGHT offers superior positioning by hugging the wall, isolating me from the enemy, and opening up a safe corridor of apples on the edge. Moving DOWN forces me into the middle of the board, which is generally more dangerous.\n\n    *   **Long-term Plan:** Secure the right-side vertical axis. Move RIGHT to (9, 8) to eat. Next turn, move DOWN to (9, 7) or (9, 6) to eat the next apple. This will allow me to grow long and dominate the resource-rich right side while the enemy struggles with the center.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to eat the apple at (9, 8). This maximizes distance from the enemy (who is forced to (6, 9)), secures a point, and sets up a safe harvesting route down the right edge of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "The current turn is 15. Based on the previous turn's state (turn 14), I predicted that Snake #0 (enemy) would be forced to move to (6, 9). The board update shows that the enemy head is indeed at (6, 9) (marked as '0' in the row y=9, x=6), and their body now includes (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), and (4, 9). This confirms my prediction was correct.\n\nNow, analyzing the current state at turn 15:\n- **My Snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: (9, 8) (as a result of my move RIGHT on turn 14)\n  - Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7)]\n  - Apples: 6 (I ate the apple at (9, 8))\n  - Last Move: RIGHT\n\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n  - Head: (6, 9)\n  - Body: [(5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9)]\n  - Apples: 4\n\n- **Immediate Threats (Enemy Movement Prediction for Turn 15):**\n  - Enemy head at (6, 9).\n  - **UP (6, 10):** Invalid (off board).\n  - **DOWN (6, 8):** Occupied by my body (from previous state). If I don't move from (9, 8) to (9, 7), my body at (8, 8) will move to (7, 8), (7, 8) to (6, 8), etc. My tail (4, 7) moves to (3, 7). So the cell (6, 8) will still be occupied by my body (specifically, the segment currently at (7, 8) will move to (6, 8)). Therefore, (6, 8) is unsafe for the enemy.\n  - **LEFT (5, 9):** Occupied by their own body. Unsafe.\n  - **RIGHT (7, 9):** Currently empty. This is the only safe move for the enemy.\n  - **Conclusion:** The enemy **must move RIGHT to (7, 9)**.\n\n- **My Valid Moves from (9, 8):**\n  - **UP (9, 9):** Empty (based on the board state for y=9, x=9 is '.'). Safe.\n  - **DOWN (9, 7):** Currently contains an apple. Safe. (If I move here, I eat the apple and grow).\n  - **LEFT (8, 8):** Currently occupied by my own body. Moving here would be suicide. **Invalid.**\n  - **RIGHT (9, 8):** Invalid (off board).\n\n- **Strategic Analysis of Safe Moves (UP vs DOWN):**\n  - **Option 1: DOWN to (9, 7)**\n    - **Pros:** Eats an apple (score becomes 7-4). Moves me down the right edge, closer to the apple at (9, 6) and (9, 3), continuing my planned harvest route. Maximizes distance from the enemy's projected path (enemy at (7, 9)).\n    - **Cons:** None immediate.\n  - **Option 2: UP to (9, 9)**\n    - **Pros:** None significant.\n    - **Cons:** Misses the apple at (9, 7). Moves me to the corner (9, 9), potentially limiting future mobility (only Left and Down available next turn). Moves me away from the cluster of apples on the right side.\n\n- **Comparison and Decision:**\n  Moving DOWN to (9, 7) allows me to eat an apple, extending my lead to 7-4. It keeps me on the right edge, which is safe from the enemy (who is moving to (7, 9)). Moving UP to (9, 9) would be a wasted move that leaves an apple behind and traps me in a corner. Therefore, DOWN is the superior strategic move.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (9, 7) to eat the apple. This extends my lead and continues my safe harvest of the right-side vertical apples (next target: 9, 6).\n\nDOWN",

T T 0 . .  (My head at (9,7) is marked as '1' in row 7 actually)\n- Row 8: . . . . T T T T T T\n- Row 7: A A . A . T T A A 1  (My head is at (9,7) - marked as '1')\n- Row 6: . . . A . . . . . A\n- Row 5: . . . . A . . . . .\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . A A\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . A . .\n- Row 1: . A . . . . . . . .\n- Row 0: . . . . . . . A A .\n\nWait, I need to be careful. Looking at the board display:\nRow 7 shows: \"A A . A . T T A A 1\" - this means (0,7) is 'A', (1,7) is 'A', (2,7) is '.', (3,7) is 'A', (4,7) is '.', (5,7) is 'T', (6,7) is 'T', (7,7) is 'A', (8,7) is 'A', (9,7) is '1'. So my head is indeed at (9,7).\n\nRow 9 shows: \"9 A . . . . T T 0 . .\" - Wait, the coordinates start at 0. Let me re-read:\n\"9 A . . . . T T 0 . .\" - This is row y=9. So (0,9)='A', (1,9)='.', (2,9)='.', (3,9)='.', (4,9)='.', (5,9)='T', (6,9)='T', (7,9)='0', (8,9)='.', (9,9)='.'.\n\nSo enemy snake #0 head is at (7,9), and their body occupies (6,9), (5,9), etc. That matches the enemy snake description.\n\n**Valid Moves from (9,7):**\n1. **UP (9,8):** Currently occupied by my own body (first segment: (9,8)). This would be suicide. Invalid.\n2. **DOWN (9,6):** Empty (based on board, row 6 at x=9 shows 'A' actually). Let me check row 6: \". . . A . . . . . A\" - so (9,6) is 'A'. There's an apple there. This is safe.\n3. **LEFT (8,7):** Empty (based on board, row 7 at x=8 shows 'A'). There's an apple here too. This is safe.\n4. **RIGHT (9,7):** Off board (x=9 is max, can't go to x=10). Invalid.\n\nSo I have two safe moves: DOWN to (9,6) or LEFT to (8,7).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- **Moving DOWN to (9,6):** This would eat the apple at (9,6). This keeps me on the right edge. My body would shift: head to (9,6), body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7)]. This is safe.\n- **Moving LEFT to (8,7):** This would eat the apple at (8,7). This moves me into the interior. My body would shift: head to (8,7), body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7)]. This is also safe.\n\n**Enemy Snake Prediction:**\nEnemy head at (7,9). Their possible moves:\n- UP (7,10): Off board - invalid\n- DOWN (7,8): Currently empty? Let me check board: row 8 shows \". . . . T T T T T T\" so (7,8) is 'T'. Actually, from the board state, (7,8) is marked as 'T' in row 8. But \"T\" might be part of my body? No, my body is listed as [(9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]. So (7,8) is indeed my body. So (7,8) is occupied by me.\n- LEFT (6,9): Currently occupied by their own body (first segment: (6,9)). Invalid.\n- RIGHT (8,9): Empty (from board row 9, x=8 is '.').\n\nSo the enemy must move RIGHT to (8,9) (or possibly DOWN to (7,8) if they want to suicide, but that would be stupid - they'll choose the safe move). Let's assume they move RIGHT to (8,9).\n\n**Collision Considerations:**\nIf I move DOWN to (9,6) and enemy moves to (8,9): no collision.\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7) and enemy moves to (8,9): no collision (different rows).\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nLooking at the apple distribution:\n- Right side (x=7-9): Apples at (9,6), (8,7), (7,7), (8,0), (7,0), (7,2)\n- Left side (x=0-3): Apples at (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,1), (3,6), (3,7)\n- Center: (4,5)\n\nMy current position is on the right side. Moving LEFT to (8,7) would give me access to more apples in the right-center (like (7,7), (6,7) but that's body, (7,0), etc.). Moving DOWN to (9,6) continues my vertical harvest but may limit my leftward mobility.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: moving LEFT to (8,7) puts me at (8,7) which has an apple. Then my head is at (8,7) with body behind me. From there, I could potentially move LEFT again to (7,7) which also has an apple. That's a good path.\n\nMoving DOWN to (9,6) puts me at (9,6) with an apple. From there, I could move DOWN to (9,5) (empty), LEFT to (8,6) (empty), etc.\n\nLooking at the board more carefully:\n- (7,7) is 'A' - apple\n- (8,7) is 'A' - apple  \n- (9,6) is 'A' - apple\n- (9,3) is 'A' - apple (from the apple list)\n\nMy body currently blocks the path somewhat. If I move LEFT to (8,7), my body would be at (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), etc. From (8,7), I could then go LEFT to (7,7) next turn if it's safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,6), from there I could go LEFT to (8,6) next turn, then maybe DOWN to (8,5), etc.\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth moves are safe. Moving LEFT to (8,7) gives me an apple and opens up a path to (7,7) next turn. Moving DOWN to (9,6) also gives me an apple but keeps me on the edge.\n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because it moves me toward the center and more apple options. However, I need to be careful about the enemy. The enemy is at (7,9) and will likely move to (8,9). If I move to (8,7), that's two rows below them - safe.\n\nActually, wait. Let me think about the enemy's possible next moves more carefully. If enemy moves to (8,9), then from there they could potentially move DOWN to (8,8) next turn. But (8,8) is currently my body (second segment). By the time they move there, my body will have moved. Let me simulate:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,7):\n- My head: (8,7)\n- My body: [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7)]\n- Enemy head: (8,9) (predicted)\n- Enemy body: [(7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8)]\n\nNext turn, if enemy moves DOWN to (8,8), they would collide with my body segment that is currently at (8,8) but would have moved to (7,8). Actually, by next turn, my body segment at (8,8) moves to (7,8), so (8,8) would be empty. So enemy could safely move to (8,8).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,6):\n- My head: (9,6)\n- My body: [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7)]\n- Enemy head: (8,9)\n- Enemy body: [(7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8)]\n\nFrom (9,6), my next moves could be LEFT to (8,6), DOWN to (9,5), or UP to (9,7) which is now body.\n\nI think both are viable. Let me look at the apple distribution again. There's an apple at (9,3) that I could reach if I go DOWN. But there are also apples at (8,7) and (7,7) if I go LEFT.\n\nGiven that I'm already on the right side and there are apples on the right side, and I have a clear path DOWN the right edge, I think moving DOWN to (9,6) is reasonable. It also keeps me farther from the enemy initially.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The enemy is at (7,9). If I move to (8,7), I'm moving LEFT and DOWN, getting closer to the enemy vertically (only 2 rows apart vs 3 rows apart if I go to (9,6)). While collision isn't immediate, it's something to consider.\n\nBut actually, (8,7) vs (9,6) - the distance to enemy head (7,9):\n- From (8,7): sqrt((8-7)^2 + (7-9)^2) = sqrt(1+4) = sqrt(5) \u2248 2.24\n- From (9,6): sqrt((9-7)^2 + (6-9)^2) = sqrt(4+9) = sqrt(13) \u2248 3.61\n\nSo (9,6) is actually farther from the enemy. That might be safer.\n\nHowever, looking at the long game, I need to collect 30 apples. I have 6, enemy has 4. I need 24 more apples. The right side has several apples, but so does the left side. I should probably plan to traverse the board.\n\nLet me think about path planning. If I go DOWN to (9,6), I can then go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), etc., making my way to the bottom right and then across the bottom. That seems like a good harvesting route.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7), I can then go LEFT to (7,7), then maybe DOWN to (7,6), etc. Also a good route.\n\nGiven that I'm already on the right edge and there's an apple at (9,6), and that moving DOWN keeps me slightly farther from the enemy initially, I'll choose DOWN.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMove DOWN to (9,6) to eat the apple and continue my vertical harvest path along the right edge. This maintains my distance from the enemy and sets up for future apple collection on the right side.\n\nDOWN",

I am moving LEFT to (8,6) to eat the apple at (8,7) next turn while keeping distance from the enemy. This sets up a path across the upper right quadrant: after (8,7), I can go LEFT to (7,7) for another apple, then DOWN to (7,6), continuing to harvest the right side while monitoring enemy movement. Need to avoid getting trapped between my own body and the enemy. Priority: collect apples safely, maintain escape routes, and outlast enemy.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nI am at (9,6). My body is [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)].\nEnemy is likely at (8,9) after moving RIGHT from (7,9).\n\nSafe moves from (9,6):\n- **UP (9,7):** Currently occupied by my own body (first segment). Invalid (would be suicide).\n- **DOWN (9,5):** Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT (8,6):** Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (9,6):** Off board (x=9 is max). Invalid.\n\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- **DOWN to (9,5):** Keeps me on the right edge. Moves me toward apples at (9,3) and (9,0) area. However, this continues a linear path with limited immediate apple options (next apple down at (9,3) is 3 cells away).\n- **LEFT to (8,6):** Moves me toward apples at (8,7) and (7,7). From (8,6), next turn I can go UP to (8,7) to eat the apple there. This is a more immediate reward and opens up a harvest path across the upper right quadrant.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:** Enemy head at (8,9). Possible moves:\n- UP (8,10): Off board - invalid\n- DOWN (8,8): Currently my body segment at (8,8). By next turn, my body moves, so (8,8) might be empty. Let's simulate:\n  - If I move LEFT to (8,6), my body becomes [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7)]\n  - So (8,8) remains occupied by my body until the turn after next.\n  - Therefore, if enemy moves DOWN to (8,8) this turn, they would collide with my body and die.\n- LEFT (7,9): Occupied by their own body (first segment). Invalid.\n- RIGHT (9,9): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo enemy will likely move RIGHT to (9,9) to avoid suicide. This is good - they move away from me.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nIf I move LEFT to (8,6) and enemy moves to (9,9): no collision. Safe.\n\n**Long-term Benefit:** Moving LEFT gives me access to two apples ((8,7) and (7,7)) in the next few turns, while moving DOWN only gives access to distant apples. I need to maximize apple collection rate. The leftward path also keeps me closer to the center of the board, providing more future options.\n\nTherefore, I choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",
