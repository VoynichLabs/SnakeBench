Not worth the risk.  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,1)** \u2013 Empty, and the opponent could rush **RIGHT** onto (9,1) \u2192 another simultaneous death.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 off\u2011board \u2192 instant doom.  \n\nSo the only *guaranteed safe* move that also grabs an apple is **UP**. \ud83c\udfaf Grab that fruit, grow a segment, and keep the pressure on the rival while staying alive. Long\u2011term plan: keep hugging the top\u2011right corner, force the opponent into a cramped corridor, and look for a head\u2011on when we have the apple lead. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Final move:**\u202fUP\n\nUP",
