The cell is empty and not adjacent to any enemy head, so it is safe, but it moves me away from the nearest apple at (1,8) and leaves only two safe follow\u2011up directions (left or right).\n- **DOWN** \u2192 would go to (4,7). This is also safe, but after the move I would only have two safe next moves (down or left) because moving up would hit my own body.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 would go to (3,8). This cell is empty, moves me one step closer to the apple at (1,8), and after the move I retain three safe follow\u2011up options (up, down, left). None of these cells are adjacent to the enemy head, so there is no immediate head\u2011on collision risk.\n\nConsidering apple proximity, future options, and collision avoidance, moving **LEFT** is the strongest choice.\n\nPlan: Continue moving left toward the (1,8) apple, preserving multiple safe directions and staying clear of any head\u2011on collisions with Snake\u202f#1.\n\nLEFT",

This step brings us closer to the lower\u2011y apples (especially the one at (1,3)), keeps three viable follow\u2011up directions (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN), and does not place us directly in front of any enemy segment that could cause a head\u2011on collision this turn.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1.

Moving LEFT would eat it, increasing the score from 23 to 24 and extending the snake by one segment.\n\n- **Future\u2011move flexibility**\n  * After a LEFT move the head will be at (4,6). From there the snake can still go UP to (4,7), DOWN to (4,5), or RIGHT back toward (5,6) (now free) without immediately running into its own body.\n  * This keeps multiple safe options for the next turn, avoiding a dead\u2011end or tight corridor.\n  * Moving UP or DOWN would not increase the score and would leave the apple at (4,6) for a later turn, possibly allowing an opponent to claim it or block the path.\n\n- **Opponent considerations**\n  * Snake\u202f#1 is far away (head at (0,1)). Its next move cannot reach (4,6) this turn, so no head\u2011on collision risk exists.\n  * Even if it moves toward us, the distance ensures we have at least one safe follow\u2011up regardless of its action.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n1. Move LEFT to eat the apple at (4,6) and grow the snake.\n2. In the next turn evaluate whether UP or DOWN leads toward other reachable apples while staying clear of snake\u202f#1\u2019s predicted path.\n3. Continue expanding while preserving at least two open adjacent cells to avoid being boxed in.\n\nLEFT  \nLEFT",
