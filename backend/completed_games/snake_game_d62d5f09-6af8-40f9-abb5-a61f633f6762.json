Since I'm currently at (6, 9), I can move up (direction: UP), down (direction: DOWN), left (direction: LEFT), or right (direction: RIGHT).\n\nTo avoid colliding with the walls, I can't move up (6 - 1 = 5, which is outside the board), left (6 - 1 = 5, which is outside the board), or right (6 + 1 = 7, which is occupied by snake #1). So, the only available move without colliding with the walls is down (direction: DOWN).\n\nHowever, to gain points and grow, I should move towards the apples. There are apples at (5, 3), (0, 4), (6, 1), (4, 9), and (1, 3). Moving down would take me away from all the apples, so it's not a good strategy to gain points.\n\nMoving left would take me towards the apple at (5, 3), but it would also take me closer to snake #1. Moving right would take me towards the apple at (6, 1), but it's not a good idea to move towards another snake.\n\nSo, the best strategy would be to move towards an apple that is further away from other snakes. In this case, the apple at (0, 4) seems to be the best choice as it's the farthest from other snakes and me.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move towards the apple at (0, 4) while keeping an eye on the other snakes' movements.\n\nNext move: LEFT (direction: LEFT)"
