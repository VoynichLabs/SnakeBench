Moving DOWN to (4, 8) will:\n1. Collect the apple, giving me my first point and growing my snake\n2. Position me perfectly to continue my apple collection strategy\n3. Keep me away from the enemy snake which is still in the lower portion at (4, 2)\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll be at (4, 8) and can then move LEFT to (3, 8) to collect the second apple in this cluster. The enemy snake doesn't appear to be heading toward these upper apples, so I should be able to collect both apples in this area safely.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (4, 8), move LEFT to (3, 8) to collect the second apple. Then I can reassess which apple to target next - either the one at (3, 6) or move toward the apples in other areas of the board.\n\nDOWN",

I can collect two apples in just two moves.\n\nThe enemy snake is still far away in the bottom-left corner, so there's no immediate threat.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (8, 7), move RIGHT to (9, 7) to collect the second apple. This will give me 2 points quickly and establish a strong position in the upper-right area of the board.\n\nUP",

This is clearly the best move.\n- **UP to (6, 9)**: Safe but doesn't accomplish much strategically\n- **DOWN to (6, 7)**: Need to check if this conflicts with my body - looking at the board, I don't see my body there, so it might be safe but not productive\n- **RIGHT to (7, 8)**: This would be moving back into my own body segment - instant death\n\n**Strategy analysis:**\nThe apple at (5, 8) is right there for the taking.

This could eventually lead me toward the apples at (5, 8) or (1, 9), though I would need to be careful to avoid the enemy snake in that area.\n\n**DOWN (3, 3):**\nMoving down is safe and would continue my path toward the bottom of the board where three apples are located: (5, 0), (7, 0), and (8, 1). This seems like a promising direction as there are multiple targets and no immediate obstacles.\n\n**RIGHT (4, 4):**\nMoving right gives me more space in the center of the board and maintains flexibility. It doesn't commit me to a specific apple yet but keeps my options open.\n\n## Decision:\nI think moving DOWN is the best choice now. It continues my progress toward the cluster of apples at the bottom of the board (5, 0), (7, 0), and (8, 1). The bottom area is relatively free of obstacles, and I can plan a route to collect these apples efficiently.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving DOWN to (3, 3), I'll evaluate whether to continue southward toward the bottom apples or to move right to start navigating toward (5, 0). I'll need to be careful to plan a path that allows me to collect multiple apples without boxing myself in.\n\nDOWN",

However, getting the closest apple first is more efficient.\n\nMoving LEFT is invalid as it would hit my own body.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving RIGHT to (5, 3), I'll continue eastward toward the apple at (7, 3). Once I collect that apple, I'll evaluate whether to move down toward the bottom apples at (5, 0), (7, 0), and (8, 1) based on the updated game state.\n\nRIGHT",

I'm now in position to collect the apple at (1, 9) with a simple LEFT move. This will give me a point and grow my snake by one segment.\n\nThe enemy snake (#1) is still positioned around (7, 3) in the middle-left area of the board with their head at (7, 3), so there's no immediate threat to my current position.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving LEFT is the obvious choice here - it gets me the apple at (1, 9), which was my target all along.\n\n**Next turn strategy:** After collecting this apple, I'll be at (1, 9) on the top-left area. I'll need to plan my route to the next apple. The remaining apples are at (8, 1), (7, 0), (5, 0), and (1, 3). The apple at (1, 3) looks like it might be the next logical target since it's relatively close and I can move down the left edge safely.

I'm on the direct path to the apple at (1, 3):\n- Current position: (1, 5)\n- Next move DOWN to (1, 4) - appears clear\n- Then DOWN to (1, 3) - APPLE!\n\nThe position (1, 4) on the board shows as empty ('.' character), so it's safe to continue.\n\n**Enemy Snake Consideration:**\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7, 0) with body segments including (2, 5) which explains why RIGHT would be deadly. The enemy snake doesn't appear to be threatening my downward path.\n\n**Decision:**\nContinue DOWN to (1, 4). This keeps me on the optimal path to reach the apple at (1, 3) in just one more move after this.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:** After reaching (1, 4), move DOWN one more time to (1, 3) to collect the apple.

Looking at my options, I can't go UP (into my own body) or DOWN (out of bounds). That leaves me with LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nGoing LEFT would bring me closer to the apple at (5, 0), which aligns with my previous strategy. This apple is just two steps away.\n\nGoing RIGHT doesn't immediately lead to any apple, but it's a valid move that keeps me alive.\n\nThe enemy snake is still far away in the upper part of the board, so there's no immediate threat from it.\n\n## Decision Process:\nGoing LEFT to (6, 0) is the best choice because:\n1. It brings me closer to the apple at (5, 0)\n2. It's a safe move that doesn't risk collision\n3. It follows my previously stated strategy of heading toward the next closest apple\n4. The alternative (RIGHT) doesn't offer any immediate advantage\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving LEFT to (6, 0), I'll continue LEFT again to collect the apple at (5, 0). After that, I should evaluate whether to go for the apples at the far left (0, 0) and (0, 3), or potentially look for a path upward if it's safe to do so. I need to be careful about trapping myself against walls or creating closed loops with my own body.\n\nLEFT",

Perfect move to collect it and gain a point\n- **LEFT**: Would hit the wall at x=-1 - DEATH  \n- **RIGHT to (1, 1)**: This also has an apple! Another good option\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI have two excellent options here - I can collect either the apple at (0, 0) by moving DOWN, or the apple at (1, 1) by moving RIGHT. Both are immediate apple collections.\n\nLooking at positioning after each move:\n1. If I go DOWN to (0, 0): I collect an apple but then I'm in the bottom-left corner, which could limit my options next turn\n2. If I go RIGHT to (1, 1): I collect an apple and have better positioning for future moves\n\nActually, let me go with DOWN to (0, 0) since that was my original plan and it's a guaranteed apple. From the corner, I can then move RIGHT to collect the apple at (1, 1) on the following turn, giving me two apples in consecutive moves.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (0, 0), move RIGHT to (1, 1) to collect the second apple.

The enemy snake #1 is listed as being at position (1, 0), but looking at the board state, I see:\n- Position (1, 0) shows \"1\" which represents the enemy snake's head\n- My only potentially safe move would be RIGHT, but that's directly into the enemy snake\n\nThis appears to be a losing position. However, let me check if there's any possibility that the enemy snake might move away from (1, 0) simultaneously, but that's not how the game mechanics work - I need to make a move to a currently safe position.\n\nGiven that all moves lead to death, I have to choose the least bad option. Since this appears to be an unavoidable loss situation, I'll go with:\n\n**Strategy for next turn (if I survive):** This situation shows I made a tactical error by going into the corner.

This is perfect timing as I was getting dangerously close to the bottom left corner where the enemy snake is located.\n\nAfter capturing this apple, I'll need to plan my next moves carefully. Looking at the board:\n- The closest apple after this one would be at (8, 4)\n- I need to avoid the enemy snake currently at (0, 0) with a long body extending upward\n- I need to watch out for my own body which forms a partial loop\n\nMoving UP now will allow me to collect the apple at (1, 1) and then I should consider moving to the right to begin navigating toward the next apple while avoiding getting trapped.\n\n## Next Turn Strategy\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (1, 1), I should move RIGHT to begin creating a path toward the apple at (8, 4).

Looking at the board representation and enemy snake positions:\n- Enemy Snake #1 is at position (1, 0) with body following\n- If I move RIGHT from (0, 0), I would go to (1, 0) which is occupied by the enemy snake's head\n\nThis is a critical situation! I'm trapped in the corner with no safe moves available. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, let me look at this more carefully. The enemy snake #1 is listed as being at position (1, 0), but looking at the board state, I see:\n- Position (1, 0) shows \"1\" which represents the enemy snake's head\n- My only potentially safe move would be RIGHT, but that's directly into the enemy snake\n\nThis appears to be a losing position. However, let me check if there's any possibility that the enemy snake might move away from (1, 0) simultaneously, but that's not how the game mechanics work - I need to make a move to a currently safe position.\n\nGiven that all moves lead to death, I have to choose the least bad option. Since this appears to be an unavoidable loss situation, I'll go with:\n\n**Strategy for next turn (if I survive):** This situation shows I made a tactical error by going into the corner. In future games, avoid corner traps and always ensure there's an escape route.\n\nRIGHT",

This would result in a collision.\n- RIGHT: (2, 0) - This is my own body, so invalid.\n- UP: (1, 1) - This is clear and has an apple!\n- DOWN: (1, -1) - This is out of bounds.\n\n## Strategic Analysis\n\nThe only valid and safe move is UP, which fortunately leads directly to an apple at (1, 1). This is perfect timing as I was getting dangerously close to the bottom left corner where the enemy snake is located.\n\nAfter capturing this apple, I'll need to plan my next moves carefully. Looking at the board:\n- The closest apple after this one would be at (8, 4)\n- I need to avoid the enemy snake currently at (0, 0) with a long body extending upward\n- I need to watch out for my own body which forms a partial loop\n\nMoving UP now will allow me to collect the apple at (1, 1) and then I should consider moving to the right to begin navigating toward the next apple while avoiding getting trapped.\n\n## Next Turn Strategy\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (1, 1), I should move RIGHT to begin creating a path toward the apple at (8, 4). I'll need to be careful not to trap myself against my own body and maintain awareness of the enemy snake's position.\n\nUP",
