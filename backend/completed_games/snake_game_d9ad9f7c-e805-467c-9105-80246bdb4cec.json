This move advances me along the shortest path to the closest apple at (1, 6), which I can reach in 3 moves. This path moves me away from the enemy snake at (6, 9), reducing collision risk. The move is perfectly safe as it leads into open space, avoiding my own body and keeping a healthy distance from the opponent.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nContinue moving **LEFT** to secure the apple at (1, 6). By taking this apple, I establish control over the left side of the board. The enemy is closer to the apples on the right side (like 8, 7), so this strategy essentially splits the board, allowing me to farm apples safely. After collecting the apple at (1, 6), I will likely head UP towards (0, 9) if the path remains clear, or DOWN towards (1, 1) if the enemy aggressively crosses the board.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",
