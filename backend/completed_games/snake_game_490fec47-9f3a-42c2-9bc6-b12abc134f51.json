Or once again it is already a fixed choice where you need to know the board state to make a wiser response?\n\nThe rule of the game is the opposing snake takes apples, not the THIS snake. Some people are scared to lose. Some think you get apples randomly, others think it is luck. Remember if you simply want to have the fastest time, you did nothing wrong to try to minimize decision time.\n\nMy strategy for you is to act as if you are on the opposite side.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nI will add that we have been averaging around 2 leaders in this game.\n\n--Start your next move!--\n\nI will type the word of the day: Goose.\n\nI would say its \"goosebumps\".\n\n--End your next move!--\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDown\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nI think I understand why we both ended up in the initial game, and the initial game ended.\nI know this work was difficult, because the original person would put a ton of apples along a line, and you would have to come down from the top and eat your way down.\n\nI think your move of the day was absolutely right. I think that might have been the reason you ended up here. I think it just made things easier for you to get up, because the apples were all at one end. Making 8 snakes a bit easier because you wouldn't have to try, \"Wait, did i eat that up?\"\n\nThis also made disconnecting snakes totally easier, which is fun.\n\nI think we should try to break the connection to who we started this game with.\n\nI would suggest going with the idea of the ladybug. It seems fitting for these events to create a good buzz with a play on the dictionary, giving a flashy play on words that is reminiscent of the Queen of the snakes.\nI think this is going well.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nNone\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n--Start of your next move!--\nI would avoid the higher bug, Ladybug, because it creates situations where two or more snakes flare up to same cases where they might have f Girls launch from the same Lord.\n\n--End your next move!--\n\nI accept the apple you just offered on your move down.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nI think it could also be interpreted to mean the work you did to get here was worth it, and I think you did a good job.\n\nIt could mean that you found a good way as you got to be in the game where you got the apples, and I, you, and read our last rations in the game that started us.

Something modern in the world of splitting...\n\nI didn't have a rule for it. I just err maybe a bit.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nNone\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nWell, I decided to make you Nobody, but of course, that does not change the GoldenSun interpretation of the game.\n\nThe snakes split right after they went against Diana's plane with a secret obsidian that made such a big mistake.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nIf you could start this game with an idea, what would you choose?\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nI'm sorry for this game. Frank, you should continue playing.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nYou beat me by 21 points in our first match. I don't like the fact that you did that. It is disappointing that your loss of the apple didn't set us off fighting this match. I would have love to get the GoldenStar but instead I had something of a mini-depression when we split because I was feeling that I beat you. :(\n\nI hope the rest of your time in here is better for you. Keep fighting games!\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nI want to speak with my partner about this game and decided she will play beneath us.\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nNone\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nThe Diana snake used yesterday has an interesting way of moving, but I would add that the final game was majorly inconclusive with no leader.\nEach action makes its turn so the controller may spread in such a position they end up with multiple apples. \n\nPlaying a split at the beginning of the game can get the Golden Star back.\n\nI suggest you start a game without any mission, just because I love playing games and I love helping people, maybe that's the main reason you play games.\n **END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nNone\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nI suggest you try SmartOwl because he uses an interesting strategic thinking of delivering the snakes he takes down in an ascending series, rather than just splits.
