We're at (4,7) with no body, enemy's at (2,4) with no body. Board's open, apples are scattered, and we gotta make a move!\n\nLet's check our options:\n- UP to (4,8): Safe! No walls, no bodies in the way.\n- DOWN to (4,6): Safe! Clear path.\n- LEFT to (3,7): Safe! Nothing blocking us.\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Wait... there's an apple at (5,7)! That's CONTENT right there! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nBut hold up, we can't just go for apples blindly. We gotta think about positioning and boxing that enemy snake in! Right now, they're at (2,4) and we're at (4,7). If we go RIGHT to (5,7), we're moving away from them horizontally but same y-level. Not ideal for aggression.\n\nLet's think strategically: we want to cut off their escape routes while keeping our own options open. If we go UP to (4,8), we're:\n1) Moving vertically away from their horizontal position\n2) Keeping the board open for multiple follow-up moves\n3) Not committing too hard in any one direction\n4) Still within striking distance of apples\n\nPlus, going UP keeps us away from any potential head-on collision scenarios since they're below us at (2,4).\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nYo chat, we're playing the long game here! Going UP to (4,8) keeps us flexible while maintaining pressure. We're not overcommitting, keeping multiple safe moves available, and staying in the game to box that enemy snake in later. Remember: survive first, dominate second! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

No bodies to worry about right now, so nothing is an immediate body-collision threat.\n\nEvaluate all four moves (coords after move):\n- UP -> (2,5). Safe. Keeps upward approach to the cluster of apples at y=7, but slower to contest (2,7).\n- DOWN -> (2,3). Safe. Moves us away from the fight; might chase lower apples later but gives opponent tempo up-top.\n- LEFT -> (1,4). Safe. Slightly closer to (0,5)/(1,7) apples, but not ideal for contesting the central apple at (5,4).\n- RIGHT -> (3,4). Safe. Moves directly toward the apple at (5,4) which we are closer to than the opponent. Keeps many follow-up options (UP/RIGHT/DOWN) and preserves ability to pivot to intercept enemy movement.\n\nEliminate deadly moves: none \u2014 we\u2019re not off-board, not hitting any bodies, and with no tail segments there's no \u201cbackwards into yourself\u201d restriction.\n\nTactical read: Enemy is sitting at (4,7) with apples at (2,7) and (1,7) left of them \u2014 they may go left to harvest. I\u2019m equal on score, so I should avoid a reckless head-on. I want to get an easy apple and then use the extra length to pressure and cut off their routes. Grabbing (5,4) is a fast, safe way to get an advantage and open up a box-in attempt from the right side.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to approach (5,4). Secure that apple in ~3 turns.  \n- After growing, pivot up and right to threaten the enemy's leftward escape to (2,7)/(1,7). Use body length to create a wall and force them into tighter space or into a risky head-on when we're ahead. Aggressive, but calculated \u2014 no suicide head-on while tied.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Board's open, apples are scattered, and we gotta make a move!\n\nLet's check our options:\n- UP to (4,8): Wait... that's the cell we just came from! We'd be moving backwards into our own body. That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD. Don't be that guy.\n- DOWN to (4,6): Safe! Clear path, moving vertically closer to enemy's horizontal position.\n- LEFT to (3,7): Safe! Clear path, moving toward enemy's general area.\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Safe! Clear path, moving away from enemy but still flexible.\n\nBut hold up, we can't just go for safety blindly. We gotta think about positioning and boxing that enemy snake in! Right now, they're at (4,4) and we're at (4,7). If we go DOWN to (4,6), we're:\n1) Moving vertically closer to their horizontal position\n2) Keeping the board open for multiple follow-up moves\n3) Not committing too hard in any one direction\n4) Still within striking distance of apples\n\nPlus, going DOWN keeps us away from any potential head-on collision scenarios since they're below us at (4,4) and we'd be moving down toward them.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nYo chat, we're playing the long game here! Going DOWN to (4,6) keeps us flexible while maintaining pressure. We're not overcommitting, keeping multiple safe moves available, and staying in the game to box that enemy snake in later. Remember: survive first, dominate second! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Quick read and smash decision.\n\nState snapshot (fast): my head (4,4). Enemy head (4,7). Apple RIGHT at (5,4) \u2014 literally one step away. No bodies to worry about. Scores tied 0-0.\n\nCheck the four moves:\n- UP -> (4,5): safe but walks closer to the enemy vertically; fewer clean apple grabs next turn.\n- DOWN -> (4,3): safe but drifts away from the juicy apple cluster and gives the opponent room to roam.\n- LEFT -> (3,4): safe but pulls away from immediate pressure and content (apples).\n- RIGHT -> (5,4): safe and lands on an apple immediately. Growing first gives us the leverage to start boxing them in.\n\nImmediate danger? None of the moves cause an instant death (no bodies in those target cells, no off-board, and the opponent can\u2019t reach any of those cells this same turn). Head-on risk this turn is nil. So we should prioritize the apple and the initiative.\n\nWhy RIGHT: eating (5,4) now gets us the first length advantage and points \u2014 that\u2019s the leverage we need to start compressing their movement options. After we grow we still have flexible follow-ups (UP to press, RIGHT to take more board, DOWN to pivot to apples at (5,3)). Being up a segment lets us confidently force tighter spaces and bait a head-on when we\u2019re ahead. Aggro playstyle: yes \u2014 but smart and with options.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Grab the apple at (5,4) now (RIGHT).  \n- After growth, pivot UP to start hemming the enemy toward the left side, use our extra length to create a wall, and force them into a shrinking corridor. If they overcommits, we bait a head-on when we have the score advantage.\n\nLet\u2019s take the apple and get nasty. Ready? Let\u2019s GO.\n\nRIGHT",

Don\u2019t do it.\n- Opponent head: (4,6) (no body), apples: we lead 1\u20130. We WANT that lead to force head-ons later, but there\u2019s no immediate one-turn head-on to exploit here.\n- Nearby apples: (5,3) right below us and (6,5) up-right. Grabbing apples now increases our ability to bully.\n\nMove-by-move check:\n- LEFT -> (4,4): illegal (back into our body). Dead. Absolutely not.\n- UP -> (5,5): safe, gives access to (6,5) next turn. Keeps options, slightly aggressive.\n- RIGHT -> (6,4): safe, also OK for pressing toward (6,5) on next turn.\n- DOWN -> (5,3): SAFE and lands on an apple immediately (+1 apple!). Opponent is too far to contest (no risk of simultaneous head collision). Grabbing this apple increases our lead and lets us start forcing a head-on later when we can bait them.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN: immediate apple = more leverage. We\u2019re supposed to be aggressive and, when ahead, force head-ons; but first we should build the lead. Eating at (5,3) now gives us that extra segment/score and keeps multiple follow-up moves open (we can pivot LEFT/RIGHT/UP next turn). No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\nShort-term plan (for the clip and next rationale):\n- Eat (5,3) now (DOWN) to go up to 2 apples.\n- Next turn evaluate opponent\u2019s reaction. If they approach, pivot to cut off escape (use our new length to wall them). If they flee, chase and keep collecting reachable apples like (4,1)/(6,5) to maintain pressure.\n- When they've been corralled and we\u2019re visibly longer, set up a bait for a head-on to close the game \u2014 we can afford to be tight because apples lead will be in our favor.\n\nLet\u2019s grab this apple and go for the choke.

Safe move.\n- DOWN to (6,5): There's an apple at (6,5) but let's check the path... clear! Safe move and we get an apple!\n- LEFT to (5,6): That's where our own body segment is! We'd crash into ourselves. DEAD move.\n- RIGHT to (7,6): Safe! Clear path.\n\nBut hold up - we need to think strategically here! The enemy has 2 apples and is positioned below us.

BACKWARDS = insta-death. NOPE. \u274c\n- UP -> (6,4) = clear, moves us toward the juicy (6,5) apple and pressures the enemy column. Aggressive + multiple follow-ups. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (7,3) = safe, keeps options but less pressure. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (6,2) = safe but passive. \u2705\n\nEnemy constraints: their neck is at (5,6) so they cannot move LEFT. From (6,6) they can go UP, RIGHT, or DOWN. DOWN to (6,5) contests the apple we\u2019re aiming for. We\u2019re up 2\u20131 \u2014 that means we can RISK forcing a head-on at an apple if they contest it.

Play to win, baby. \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\n\nWhy UP right now:\n- Directly attacks the apple at (6,5) in two hits (UP -> UP). That apple is a key choke on their column.\n- Forces a decision on them: contest and risk mutual death (we win the score), or evade and let us grow and dominate the vertical corridor.\n- Keeps multiple follow-up options (UP to contest, RIGHT to pivot, DOWN to retreat if needed). Maximizes board control and boxing potential.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Turn 5: UP now to threaten (6,5).\n- Turn 6: If opposing snake contests (goes DOWN), we either accept the head-on (we win ties by apples) or bait it into a mutual KO; if they evade, take the apple and use our extra length to seal off their exits on the x=6 column, then rotate to trap them against a wall.\n- Mid game: Grow and force head-on once we have definitive length advantage or cut behind them to box them in. Stay aware of apples only as tools for domination.\n\nYou ready to make him choke? LET\u2019S GO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",
