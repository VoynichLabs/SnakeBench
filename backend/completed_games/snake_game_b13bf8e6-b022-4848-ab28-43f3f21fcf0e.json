None are immediately accessible from the snake.\n- The square to the left (8,8) is **empty**, and **none of the enemy snakes are present** \u2014 crucial! This means the only threat right now isn't the enemy snake at (7,8), because the snake can move left adjacent to the enemy, but the immediate next available direction is unblocked.\n- The snake has no points yet, so the immediate goal is to avoid self-collision and any potential hazard (i.e., the snake #1 may try to attack or the field may shift, but on a static board, no other dynamic changes).\n\nGiven the unclaimed, empty space clearly to the left of the snake\u2019s head \u2014 **(8,8)** \u2014 is the safest and most logical move. Moving left to (8,8) advances the head, creates new space for growth, and doesn\u2019t risk exhausting any hidden hazard. While apples are nearby, the snake can move around them (there\u2019s already space in the field and the snake has no presence there), and shifting left keeps the body (when added) out of immediate danger from the right-aligned snake.\n\n**Strategy**: Prioritize growth (if possible). Since the left path is unoccupied, moving left will enable the snake to grow if it turns around. Also, avoid self-collision and random jumps, so a deliberate motion in one direction works best.\n\n**Next move**: **LEFT** to (8,8).",
