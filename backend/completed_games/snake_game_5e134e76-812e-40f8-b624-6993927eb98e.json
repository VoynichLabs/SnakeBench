There are five apples on the board, and I need to decide which one to go for based on their positions and proximity.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the apples\u2019 locations and their distance from me:\n\n- (6, 8): Distance = $\\sqrt{(6-3)^2 + (8-6)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4} = \\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.61$\n- (5, 8): Distance = $\\sqrt{(5-3)^2 + (8-6)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 4} = \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.83$\n- (3, 9): Distance = $\\sqrt{(3-3)^2 + (9-6)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n- (6, 9): Distance = $\\sqrt{(6-3)^2 + (9-6)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 9} = \\sqrt{18} \\approx 4.24$\n- (1, 8): Distance = $\\sqrt{(1-3)^2 + (8-6)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 4} = \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.83$\n\nThe closest apples are at (5, 8) and (1, 8), both approximately 2.83 units away. (3, 9) is slightly further at 3 units, while the apples at (6, 8) and (6, 9) are a bit farther away.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **Apple at (5, 8):** This is a relatively safe option since there\u2019s no immediate threat from the enemy snake, and I can reach it quickly. It\u2019s also close, which minimizes my risk of running into an enemy.\n- **Apple at (1, 8):** Similar distance, but I\u2019d need to move left a few times, which could potentially expose me to the enemy snake at (9, 7) if it decides to move left. This option is riskier but still viable.\n- **Apple at (3, 9):** It\u2019s a safe option, but slightly farther than (5, 8) and (1, 8).\n- **Apples at (6, 8) and (6, 9):** These are farther away, and while they are on the top row, the enemy snake at (9, 7) could potentially block me. These are riskier options, especially since I\u2019d have to move closer to the top wall, where I could get trapped.\n\n### Strategy\n\nGiven the current board state and available options, I\u2019ll prioritize the apple at (5, 8) because it\u2019s the closest without significant threat from the enemy snake. My move: **RIGHT** (towards the apple at 5, 8).\n\n### Next Move Plan\n\nMove RIGHT. I'll re-evaluate the position of the apples and potential enemy snake movements next turn.\n\n**NEXT MOVE: RIGHT**",
