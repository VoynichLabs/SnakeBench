Enemy snake (ID 0) head is at (3, 0).\nAvailable apples: (1, 7), (4, 4), (6, 8), (5, 0), (7, 1).\n\nMy current location is (3, 9). This is the top edge of the board.\n\n1. **Evaluate potential moves:**\n   - UP: (3, 10). Out of bounds (Y > 9). DIE.\n   - DOWN: (3, 8). Safe. Moves towards apples (1, 7), (4, 4), (6, 8).\n   - LEFT: (2, 9). Safe.\n   - RIGHT: (4, 9). Safe.\n\n2. **Immediate objective:** Gather apples.\n   The closest apples seem to be (1, 7) and (6, 8).\n\n   - Apple (1, 7): Distance 2 moves (Left 2, Down 2 minimum manhattan distance considering walls, but currently I am at (3, 9)).\n   - Apple (6, 8): Distance 4 moves (Right 3, Down 1 minimum manhattan distance).\n\n3. **Analyzing safe moves:**\n\n   - **DOWN (3, 8):** This moves me down the board, which is good for reaching the main cluster of apples. It immediately closes the distance to (1, 7) and (6, 8).\n   - **LEFT (2, 9):** Stays on the top edge, moves slightly closer to (1, 7) but doesn't reduce the distance in Y.\n   - **RIGHT (4, 9):** Stays on the top edge, moves slightly closer to (6, 8) but doesn't reduce the distance in Y.\n\n4. **Collision check:**\n   Snake #0 is at (3, 0). Snake #0's likely moves are UP (3, 1), LEFT (2, 0), or RIGHT (4, 0) to get apples (5, 0) or (7, 1). There is no risk of immediate collision with Snake #0, as we are 9 cells apart vertically.\n\n5. **Decision:**\n   Moving DOWN seems the most strategically sound move as it opens up the board and reduces Y-distance to multiple apples. From (3, 8), I can then aim to go LEFT towards (1, 7) or RIGHT towards (6, 8).\n\nLet's choose DOWN.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move towards (1, 7) or (6, 8). Since (1, 7) is closest to my current X position of 3, I will likely go for it.\n\nDOWN",
