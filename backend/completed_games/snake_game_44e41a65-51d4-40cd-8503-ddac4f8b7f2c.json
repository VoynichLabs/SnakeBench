Keeping multiple viable options is important for future apple hunting and for avoiding traps.  \n\nA short plan:\u202fMove LEFT now to (8,\u202f0), then head upward toward the cluster of apples near (8,\u202f5) and (8,\u202f8) while staying flexible to shift left or right as needed.

The enemy snake has no body and is far away at (9,0), so there\u2019s no risk of a head-on collision this turn.\n\nStrategic note: eat the nearby apple now to gain points and increase length, but avoid getting trapped by your own body in future turns. After growing, keep options open by heading toward open cells like (8,9) or (9,8) rather than back toward your tail.\n\nPlan for next turns: after consuming at (8,8), prefer moves that maintain space (avoid immediately turning back into your body) and chase nearby apples while keeping distance from the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy heads could potentially move into (6,3) this turn, but that would only cause a head\u2011on collision if both heads target the same cell; since we cannot predict the opponent\u2019s exact move, the safest assumption is to avoid a cell that is not contested. Given that (6,3) is empty for the opponent\u2019s bodies now, the risk is minimal.  \n- This move also leaves multiple future options: from (6,3) I can later explore UP, DOWN, or LEFT without immediately hitting my own tail, preserving flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for the next few turns:**  \n- Continue prioritizing moves that eat apples while keeping the head away from my own tail.  \n- Avoid moves that push me toward the edge of the board or into tight corridors where my length could trap me.  \n- Monitor the opponent\u2019s head position; if it appears to be heading toward the same cell I intend to occupy, consider an alternate safe direction (though currently only RIGHT is safe).  \n- Keep growth gradual to maintain maneuverability and aim to reach 30 apples before the turn limit.\n\nRIGHT",
