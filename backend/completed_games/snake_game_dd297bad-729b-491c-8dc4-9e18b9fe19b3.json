Safe. Moving DOWN to (6,4)? Empty. Moving LEFT to (5,5)? That's an apple! Safe. Moving RIGHT to (7,5)? Empty.\n- Enemy at (0,7). If he moves RIGHT to (1,7)? That's an apple! He'll likely go for it. If he moves UP/DOWN? He's near the wall.\n\n**STRATEGY PLAN:**\nLet's box him in! I'm at (6,5), he's at (0,7). The board has apples scattered. I need to dominate the center and cut off his expansion. I'm going for (5,5) - LEFT move. Why? It's an apple! +1 score immediately. It also positions me closer to the center-left clusters. If I eat now, I grow, and if he goes for (1,7) apple, I'm building length to trap him later. We want to be aggressive, get points, and force him into tight spots.\n\n**MOVE SELECTION:**\nAll 4 moves are safe. UP to (6,6) gets an apple but puts me near top edge. DOWN to (6,4) is empty. RIGHT to (7,5) is empty. LEFT to (5,5) gets an apple and is centrally located. Best for content and positioning. Let's go LEFT!\n\nLEFT",

Enemy head: (6,5). Nobody has any body segments (we're both length 1). Apples around us at (1,7), (4,7), (1,6), etc.\n- Moves from (0,7):\n  - LEFT \u2192 (\u22121,7): instant death. Nope. \ud83d\udc80\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (1,7): apple! Safe, no snake there. Good pick and gives us the first point. \ud83c\udf4e\n  - UP \u2192 (0,8): safe, but doesn\u2019t gain score immediately.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,6): safe, also no immediate apple.\n\nRisk check and reasoning:\n- No immediate head-on threat \u2014 opponent is too far to contest (1,7) this turn. Taking the apple gives us the lead (1\u20130), which lets us be more aggressive afterward (we WANT head-on when we have the higher score).\n- Taking RIGHT (eat at 1,7) still leaves multiple follow-up moves: from (1,7) we can go (2,7), (1,8), or (1,6) (the last is another apple at 1,6). That keeps our options open and pressures the board to the east where the opponent is operating.\n- UP or DOWN are safe, but they\u2019re passive and waste the chance to grab the point and seize initiative. We play to dominate \u2014 not to turtle. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Grab (1,7) now. Then push east toward (4,7) and control the top-middle corridor. If the rival closes to force a head-on and we still have more apples, we accept the trade. Otherwise, use apples at (1,6)/(4,7) to extend and box him in from the west/north.\n\nTime to execute \u2014 let\u2019s snag that apple and start trapping! \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",

Moving UP to (5,6)? Empty. Moving DOWN to (5,4)? Empty. Moving LEFT to (4,5)? Empty. Moving RIGHT to (6,5)? That's my own tail! If I move RIGHT, I'd be moving into my own body (tail at (6,5)), which is a crash\u2014I die. So RIGHT is instantly out.  \n- Enemy at (1,7).

He might avoid his tail, so he's likely to go UP/DOWN/RIGHT.  \n\n**STRATEGY PLAN:**  \nWe're tied 1-1 in apples. I need to grow faster to dominate. I'm centered at (5,5), he's on the left edge at (1,7). I should push leftward to cut off his expansion and claim the left side of the board.

No simultaneous head collision risk if we take (1,6).\n\nWhy DOWN is the play:\n- Immediate reward: gets us to 2 apples (2\u20131 lead). We WANT that lead so we can start forcing head-on collisions later.\n- Board control: after eating we can threaten (1,5) next turn (another nearby apple) or pivot east to pressure the top corridor toward (4,7).

Let\u2019s run the brain before we move.\n\nQuick safety sweep from our head (1,5):\n- UP \u2192 (1,6) is our neck (backwards). Instant death. NOPE. \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,4) is safe.

If they go LEFT into (2,5) we get a head-on \u2014 and we\u2019re up 3\u20131, so a mutual collision = OUR WIN. Do we want that? Yes. Do we pressure them into it? Hell yes. \ud83d\ude08\n\nRisk analysis & strategy:\n- We have the lead. Forcing a head-on when ahead is a winning play if the enemy takes the bait. Even if they avoid it, moving RIGHT keeps aggressive posture and gives us leverage to cut off their escape next turn.\n- DOWN is safer and apple-y, but it\u2019s passive \u2014 lets them breathe and escape. We want to force mistakes or a double-KO that favors us.\n- LEFT is too timid; we\u2019re not here to stall.\n\nPlan (short-term): Move RIGHT to (2,5) to threaten an immediate head-on. If they go LEFT and collide, we win the match by apple count. If they go UP/DOWN to avoid collision, we follow up to cut off their corridor (aim to pivot to their west side and trap them against the board edge).
