This is the most direct path to gaining an apple.\n- LEFT (6, 0): Safe but moves me away from the immediate apple at (8, 0) and toward the center of the board.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position at (8, 2), it has several possible moves:\n- DOWN to (8, 1): This would move it toward the bottom\n- LEFT to (7, 2): This moves it toward the center\n- UP to (8, 3): This moves it toward the top\n- RIGHT to (9, 2): This is off the board, so it's not a valid move for the enemy\n\n**Long-term plan:** The bottom cluster of apples (8, 0) is the most accessible and valuable. I should move RIGHT to (8, 0) to collect the apple immediately. This increases my apple count and keeps me in the game.
