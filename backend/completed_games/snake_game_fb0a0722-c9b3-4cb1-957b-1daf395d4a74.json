So no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nTherefore all moves are safe.\n\nNow, which move is best?\n- I want to move towards apples while keeping future options open.\n- The closest apples are at (1,4) and (8,4) - both on the same row (y=4).\n  - (1,4) is to the left (x=1 vs my x=4)\n  - (8,4) is to the right (x=8 vs my x=4)\n- So LEFT moves me towards (1,4) and RIGHT moves me towards (8,4).\n- Also, there is an apple at (5,8) which is up and right.\n\nConsidering distances:\n- To (1,4): Manhattan distance = |4-1| + |4-4| = 3\n- To (8,4): |4-8| + |4-4| = 4\n- To (5,8): |4-5| + |4-8| = 1+4=5\n\nSo (1,4) is closest. Also, moving LEFT reduces the distance to (1,4) to 2, while moving RIGHT increases it to 5.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (0,6). Moving left towards (1,4) is not directly towards the enemy, and the enemy is far.\n\nMoreover, moving LEFT to (3,4) keeps all options open: from there I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nSo LEFT seems good.\n\nAlternatively, RIGHT moves towards (8,4) and also towards (6,7) and (5,8) in the future. But it is slightly farther.\n\nGiven that (1,4) is very close (only 3 steps away), I should prioritize that.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy might also be going for apples. But since it is at (0,6), it might go for (1,4)? But (1,4) is at y=4, while enemy is at y=6. So it might go down. But it might also go right? But we don't know.\n\nBut since (1,4) is close to me, I should grab it.\n\nTherefore, I choose LEFT.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving to (3,4), next turn I can go LEFT again to (2,4) and then to (1,4) to eat the apple. But I should also be aware of enemy movements.\n\nLEFT",

So no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nTherefore all moves are safe.\n\nNow, which move is best?\n- The closest apple is at (1,4) - only 2 steps away (Manhattan distance: |3-1| + |4-4| = 2).\n- Moving LEFT to (2,4) reduces the distance to (1,4) to 1.\n- Other apples: (8,4) is 5 steps away, (5,8) is 6 steps, (6,7) is 6 steps, (1,0) is 7 steps.\n\nSo (1,4) is the most accessible. Also, the enemy is at (1,6) which is above (1,4). The enemy might move down towards (1,5) or (1,4) to get the apple. However, I am closer: I can reach (1,4) in two moves (LEFT then LEFT), while the enemy is at (1,6) and would need at least two moves (DOWN twice) to reach (1,4). So I have a good chance to get there first.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2,4) is optimal to get closer to (1,4). From (2,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (4,4) would take me away from (1,4) and towards other apples, but they are farther. UP or DOWN don't directly help with the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move to secure the apple at (1,4).\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving to (2,4), next turn I will go LEFT to (1,4) to eat the apple. I should be cautious of the enemy at (1,6) who might also be heading down. But since I am one step ahead, I should be safe.

Now let me think strategically:\n\nThe apple at (1, 4) is only 1 move away if I go DOWN. This seems like a golden opportunity - it's the closest apple to me right now. Going DOWN to (1, 5) would position me to eat the apple next turn unless the enemy snake interferes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3, 4), which is 2 spaces away from the apple at (1, 4).

Enemy snake #0 is at (1,5) with no body.\n\nPossible moves from (2,4):\n- UP: (2,5)\n- DOWN: (2,3)\n- LEFT: (1,4)\n- RIGHT: (3,4)\n\nCheck for immediate deaths:\n- All moves are within board (0-9).\n- No body segments to collide with (my own or enemy's) since both snakes have no body.\n- Enemy head is at (1,5). Note: (1,4) is adjacent to enemy head (1,5) vertically. So moving LEFT to (1,4) might risk a head-on collision if the enemy moves DOWN to (1,4) simultaneously. However, the enemy has multiple safe moves: from (1,5), it can go UP (1,6), DOWN (1,4), LEFT (0,5), RIGHT (2,5). So enemy might go DOWN to (1,4) to get the apple.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (1,4) is risky because if enemy moves DOWN to (1,4), both heads collide and both die. Since I have 0 apples and enemy has 0, both would die and game ends in draw? But according to rules: if all snakes die, the snake with more apples wins; if tied, draw. So we both have 0 apples -> draw. I want to avoid this.\n\nOther moves are safe: UP (2,5), DOWN (2,3), RIGHT (3,4) are not adjacent to enemy head.\n\nNow, which move is best?\n- The apple at (1,4) is very close, but moving LEFT is risky due to potential head-on collision.\n- Other apples: (1,0) is 4 steps away, (8,4) is 6 steps, (5,8) is 7 steps, (6,7) is 7 steps.\n- Enemy is at (1,5), which is above (1,4). Enemy is likely to move DOWN to (1,4) to get the apple. So if I avoid LEFT, enemy will probably get (1,4) next turn.\n\nBut I should prioritize safety. Since I have no apples, dying now would result in draw (if enemy also dies) or loss (if I die alone). So avoiding risk is key.\n\nConsider moves:\n- LEFT: high risk (potential head-on collision with enemy moving DOWN).\n- UP: (2,5) - moves away from (1,4) but towards other apples? Not really. Also, enemy is at (1,5), so (2,5) is adjacent to enemy head? Manhattan distance: |2-1| + |5-5|=1, so adjacent. So if I move UP to (2,5) and enemy moves RIGHT to (2,5), head-on collision. Similarly, enemy might move RIGHT to (2,5) to explore.\n- RIGHT: (3,4) - safe, not adjacent to enemy.\n- DOWN: (2,3) - safe, not adjacent to enemy.\n\nSo both UP and LEFT are risky due to adjacency to enemy head. Only DOWN and RIGHT are completely safe.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:\n- DOWN (2,3): moves towards (1,0) apple? But (1,0) is far (4 steps). Also, I might be going away from other apples.\n- RIGHT (3,4): moves towards center, and closer to apples at (8,4) (5 steps) and (6,7) (5 steps Manhattan? |3-6|+|4-7|=3+3=6) but actually (6,7) is farther.\n\nActually, (8,4) is at x=8,y=4. From (3,4), moving RIGHT increases x, so getting closer. Manhattan distance to (8,4): |3-8|+|4-4|=5. So 5 steps.\n\nFrom (2,3), to (1,0): |2-1|+|3-0|=1+3=4 steps.\n\nSo both are similar in distance to an apple.\n\nBut RIGHT (3,4) is better because it keeps me in the same row as multiple apples (1,4), (8,4)) and also closer to (5,8) and (6,7) in the long run? Actually, (3,4) is more central.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT avoids the enemy zone. Enemy is at (1,5), so moving right is safer.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving to (3,4), I can then consider going to (4,4), etc., to approach (8,4) or (6,7). Also, if enemy eats (1,4), it will grow and have a body, but I can avoid it.\n\nSo for this turn, since LEFT and UP are risky (adjacent to enemy head), and DOWN and RIGHT are safe, I choose RIGHT to move away from the enemy and towards other apples.\n\nShort-term plan: Move RIGHT to (3,4) to avoid enemy and head towards apples on the right. Next turn, from (3,4), I can go RIGHT again to (4,4) or UP/DOWN to approach (6,7) or (5,8). Avoid enemy at (1,5) which might be growing after eating (1,4).\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0 has head at (1,4) and body at [(1,5)] (since it ate the apple at (1,4) last turn? Actually, last turn enemy was at (1,5) and moved to (1,4) to eat the apple, so now it has a body segment at (1,5)). So enemy snake #0: head at (1,4), body at [(1,5)].\n\nPossible moves from my head (3,4):\n- UP: (3,5)\n- DOWN: (3,3)\n- LEFT: (2,4)\n- RIGHT: (4,4)\n\nCheck for immediate deaths:\n- All moves are within board (0-9).\n- No own body to collide with.\n- Enemy body: (1,5) is not in any of my target cells. Enemy head is at (1,4). So no immediate collision with enemy body.\n\nHowever, consider head-on collisions with enemy head (1,4):\n- My LEFT to (2,4): Manhattan distance to enemy head (1,4) is |2-1|+|4-4|=1, so adjacent. If enemy moves RIGHT to (2,4) simultaneously, we collide.\n- Other moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are not adjacent to enemy head.\n\nSo LEFT is risky due to potential head-on collision.\n\nNow, enemy moves: from (1,4), enemy can go UP (1,5) but that is its own body? Actually, enemy body is at (1,5), so enemy cannot move UP (into its own body). So enemy possible moves:\n- DOWN: (1,3)\n- LEFT: (0,4)\n- RIGHT: (2,4)\n\nSo enemy cannot go UP. Therefore, enemy might go RIGHT to (2,4) to explore or DOWN to (1,3) to avoid? Or LEFT to (0,4). So if I move LEFT to (2,4), there is a chance enemy moves RIGHT to (2,4) and we collide.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is risky.\n\nSafe moves: UP (3,5), DOWN (3,3), RIGHT (4,4).\n\nNow, which safe move is best?\nApples:\n- (1,0): far, 4 steps from (3,4)? Actually |3-1|+|4-0|=2+4=6 steps.\n- (6,7): |3-6|+|4-7|=3+3=6 steps.\n- (8,4): |3-8|+|4-4|=5+0=5 steps.\n- (5,8): |3-5|+|4-8|=2+4=6 steps.\n- (9,8): |3-9|+|4-8|=6+4=10 steps.\n\nSo closest apple is (8,4) at 5 steps. Moving RIGHT (4,4) gets me closer to (8,4) (now 4 steps away: |4-8|+|4-4|=4+0=4).\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT keeps me in the same row as (8,4), which is efficient.\n\nUP (3,5) moves towards (5,8) and (6,7)? But slightly away from (8,4).\nDOWN (3,3) moves towards (1,0) but that is 6 steps away.\n\nSo RIGHT is best for reaching (8,4).\n\nAlso, consider future moves: from (4,4), I can go RIGHT again to (5,4), then (6,4), etc., to approach (8,4). Alternatively, I can go UP from (4,4) to (4,5) to target (6,7) or (5,8).\n\nRIGHT also moves me away from the enemy at (1,4), which is safe.\n\nTherefore, choose RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving right towards (8,4) apple. After reaching (4,4), next turn consider RIGHT to (5,4) or UP to (4,5) to start approaching (6,7) or (5,8). Avoid enemy snake #0 which is on the left and has grown. Monitor enemy movements to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

So no immediate collision with enemy body or head.\n\nTherefore, all moves are safe.\n\nNow, which move is best?\nApples:\n- (1,0): |6-1|+|4-0|=5+4=9 steps.\n- (6,7): |6-6|+|4-7|=0+3=3 steps.\n- (8,4): |6-8|+|4-4|=2+0=2 steps.\n- (5,8): |6-5|+|4-8|=1+4=5 steps.\n- (9,8): |6-9|+|4-8|=3+4=7 steps.\n\nClosest apples are (8,4) at 2 steps and (6,7) at 3 steps.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,4) gets me closer to (8,4) (now 1 step: |7-8|+|4-4|=1+0=1) and also closer to (9,8) (|7-9|+|4-8|=2+4=6).\nMoving UP to (6,5) gets me closer to (6,7) (2 steps: |6-6|+|5-7|=0+2=2) and (5,8) (|6-5|+|5-8|=1+3=4).\nMoving DOWN to (6,3) moves away from most apples.\nMoving LEFT to (5,4) moves away from (8,4) and (6,7), but closer to (5,8) (|5-5|+|4-8|=0+4=4) and (1,0) (|5-1|+|4-0|=4+4=8).\n\nSo RIGHT and UP are both good.\n\nRIGHT is very efficient for (8,4): I can eat it next turn by moving RIGHT again to (8,4). Then I'll have a body segment at (7,4) and head at (8,4). After that, I can go UP to (8,5) towards (9,8) or LEFT to (7,4) but that would be backwards? Actually, after eating, my body will be at (7,4), so moving LEFT to (7,4) would be into my own body and kill me. So after eating at (8,4), I must avoid moving LEFT to (7,4). Instead, I can go UP to (8,5) or DOWN to (8,3) or RIGHT to (9,4). But RIGHT to (9,4) is safe and opens options.\n\nUP is good for (6,7): I can go UP to (6,5), then UP to (6,6), then UP to (6,7) to eat it. That takes 3 turns. Also, from (6,5) I can go RIGHT to (7,5) to approach (8,4) or (9,8).\n\nHowever, RIGHT is better because it gets me to (8,4) in one move (next turn) and I eat it immediately. That gives me an apple and a body segment, making me stronger. Also, (8,4) is closer than (6,7).\n\nEnemy snake is at (1,1) and moving away, so no immediate threat.\n\nLong-term plan: Move RIGHT to (7,4) this turn. Next turn, move RIGHT to (8,4) to eat the apple. Then, from (8,4) with body at (7,4), avoid moving LEFT to (7,4). Instead, consider UP to (8,5) towards (9,8) or RIGHT to (9,4) to explore right side. Alternatively, if enemy moves are threatening, be cautious. But for now, RIGHT is optimal.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0: head at (2,2), body at [(2,1), (2,0)], apples: 2.\n\nPossible moves from my head (7,5):\n- UP: (7,6)\n- DOWN: (7,4)\n- LEFT: (6,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> this is my body segment (neck), so unsafe.\n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe. We must consider UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nCheck for immediate deaths:\n- All moves are within board (0-9).\n- UP (7,6): not my body (only body is at (8,5)), not enemy body (enemy body at (2,1) and (2,0)).\n- DOWN (7,4): same.\n- LEFT (6,5): same.\n- Enemy head is at (2,2), far away. No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nTherefore, UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nNow, which move is best?\nApples:\n- (6,7): |7-6|+|5-7|=1+2=3 steps.\n- (5,8): |7-5|+|5-8|=2+3=5 steps.\n- (9,8): |7-9|+|5-8|=2+3=5 steps.\n- (7,7): |7-7|+|5-7|=0+2=2 steps.\n- (4,6): |7-4|+|5-6|=3+1=4 steps.\n\nClosest apple is (7,7) at 2 steps. To get closer to (7,7), moving UP to (7,6) is best: |7-7|+|6-7|=0+1=1 step. Moving LEFT to (6,5) makes it |6-7|+|5-7|=1+2=3 steps. Moving DOWN to (7,4) makes it |7-7|+|4-7|=0+3=3 steps.\n\nSo UP is clearly the best for reaching (7,7). Also, UP moves me closer to other apples like (6,7) and (5,8).\n\nConsider future moves:\n- After moving UP to (7,6): body becomes [(7,5), (8,5)]. From (7,6), I can go UP to (7,7) (apple!), DOWN to (7,5) (neck), LEFT to (6,6), RIGHT to (8,6). All safe and flexible.\n- After moving LEFT to (6,5): body becomes [(7,5), (8,5)]. From (6,5), I can go UP to (6,6), DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,5), RIGHT to (7,5) (neck). Also good, but not as direct to the closest apple.\n- After moving DOWN to (7,4): body becomes [(7,5), (8,5)]. From (7,4), I can go UP to (7,5) (neck), DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,4), RIGHT to (8,4). This moves away from most apples.\n\nEnemy is still far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to get the apple at (7,7) next turn and position well for others.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving UP to (7,6), aim to eat (7,7) next turn. Then consider (6,7) or (5,8). Avoid moving into corners. Keep an eye on enemy movement.\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #0: head at (4,3), body at [(3,3), (2,3)], apples: 2.\n\nPossible moves from my head (6,7):\n- UP: (6,8)\n- DOWN: (6,6)\n- LEFT: (5,7) - contains an apple!\n- RIGHT: (7,7) - my body segment (neck), unsafe.\n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe. We must consider UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nCheck for immediate deaths:\n- All moves are within board (0-9).\n- UP (6,8): not my body (my body at (7,7), (7,6), (7,5)), not enemy body (enemy body at (3,3), (2,3)).\n- DOWN (6,6): same.\n- LEFT (5,7): same, and it has an apple (5,7) is listed.\n- Enemy head is at (4,3), far away. No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nTherefore, UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nNow, which move is best?\nLEFT leads directly to an apple at (5,7). Eating an apple is beneficial: it gives me a point and grows my snake. After eating, my body will become [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5)] (growing by one segment). This is safe and advantageous.\n\nConsider the consequences:\n- Moving LEFT to (5,7) eats the apple. Next turn, my head will be at (5,7) and body [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5)].\n- Other moves (UP or DOWN) do not get an apple immediately.\n\nFuture moves after eating the apple:\nFrom (5,7), I can go UP to (5,8) (another apple!), DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7), RIGHT to (6,7) (which is my body, unsafe). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. This gives good flexibility and immediate access to (5,8).\n\nOther apples:\n- (5,8) is adjacent to (5,7)? Yes, directly UP.\n- (4,6) is |5-4|+|7-6|=1+1=2 steps away.\n- (9,8) is |5-9|+|7-8|=4+1=5 steps.\n- (2,0) is far.\n\nSo after eating (5,7), I can target (5,8) next turn (by going UP). That would give me two apples in two turns, which is very efficient.\n\nIf I don't take the apple now, it might remain, but enemy is far. However, taking it now is efficient.\n\nThere is no downside to taking the apple. It is safe and beneficial.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nAfter eating (5,7), aim for (5,8) next turn (if still available). Then consider (4,6) or (9,8). Keep growing and avoid traps. Enemy is still small and far, so focus on collecting apples efficiently.\n\nLEFT",

Apples at: (9,8), (4,6), (2,0), (9,2), (5,9) [note: (5,8) was eaten last turn, so it's gone]. Enemy snake #0: head at (4,5), body at [(4,4), (4,3)], apples: 2.\n\nPossible moves from my head (5,8):\n- UP: (5,9) - contains an apple!\n- DOWN: (5,7) - my body (segment 1), unsafe.\n- LEFT: (4,8)\n- RIGHT: (6,8)\n\nSo DOWN is unsafe. We must consider UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck for immediate deaths:\n- All moves are within board (0-9).\n- UP (5,9): not my body (my body at (5,7), (6,7), etc.), not enemy body (enemy body at (4,4), (4,3)).\n- LEFT (4,8): same.\n- RIGHT (6,8): same.\n- Enemy head is at (4,5), which is |5-4|+|8-5|=1+3=4 steps away. No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nTherefore, UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, which move is best?\nUP leads directly to an apple at (5,9). Eating an apple is beneficial: it gives me a point and grows my snake. After eating, my body will become [(5,8), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5)] (growing by one segment). This is safe and advantageous.\n\nConsider consequences:\n- Moving UP to (5,9) eats the apple. Next turn, my head will be at (5,9) and body [(5,8), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5)].\n- Other moves (LEFT or RIGHT) do not get an apple immediately.\n\nFuture moves after eating the apple:\nFrom (5,9), I can go DOWN to (5,8) (my body, unsafe), LEFT to (4,9) (safe), RIGHT to (6,9) (safe). So safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT. This is a bit limiting (only two directions), but manageable.\n\nOther apples:\n- (4,6) is |5-4|+|9-6|=1+3=4 steps away.\n- (9,8) is |5-9|+|9-8|=4+1=5 steps.\n- (9,2) is far.\n- (2,0) is far.\n\nSo after eating (5,9), I can target (4,6) or (9,8) in future turns. (4,6) is closer and can be reached via LEFT and then DOWN. (9,8) is to the right.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,5) and might be heading towards (4,6) as well? But I am closer to (4,6) from (5,9) than enemy is from (4,5). However, enemy might also go for (4,6) next turn.\n\nThere is no downside to taking the apple now. It is safe and beneficial.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nAfter eating (5,9), aim for (4,6) next. From (5,9), I can go LEFT to (4,9) and then DOWN to (4,8), then (4,7), then (4,6). Alternatively, if enemy is blocking, consider going RIGHT to (6,9) and then down to (6,8), etc. to approach (9,8). Avoid getting trapped in the top row. Since I have only LEFT and RIGHT safe from (5,9), I should choose LEFT to get closer to (4,6) and also have more options to go down later. But that decision is for next turn.\n\nUP",

However, I am closer to (2,9) than enemy is (|4-2|+|7-9|=2+2=4 steps).\n\nFrom (4,9):\n- If I go LEFT to (3,9), I get even closer to (2,9) (distance becomes 1). Next turn I can go LEFT to (2,9) to eat the apple.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,8), I move away from (2,9) (distance becomes |4-2|+|8-9|=2+1=3) but might be safer if enemy is blocking the path to (2,9).\n\nEnemy head at (4,7) is directly below me at (4,9).

Similarly, if I go LEFT to (3,9), enemy might move LEFT to (3,7) or other, which is not directly conflicting.\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\n- After LEFT to (3,9): next turn I can go LEFT to (2,9) (to eat apple), DOWN to (3,8), or RIGHT to (4,9) (body, unsafe).

But (4,7) is enemy head currently, but enemy will move. However, if enemy moves UP to (4,8), it would be there when I arrive? No, we move simultaneously: if I go to (4,8) and enemy goes to (4,8), we collide.\n\nSo going DOWN to (4,8) is risky because enemy might move UP to (4,8). Similarly, enemy might move LEFT to (3,7) or RIGHT to (5,7), etc.\n\nTo avoid potential collision, it's safer to go LEFT to (3,9). This gets me closer to the apple (2,9) and avoids the enemy's immediate path.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nAfter moving LEFT to (3,9), next turn go LEFT to (2,9) to eat the apple. Be cautious: if enemy moves to (2,9) same turn, we collide. But enemy is at (4,7) and needs two moves to reach (2,9): e.g., LEFT to (3,7) then LEFT to (2,7) and then UP to (2,8) or (2,9)? Actually, from (4,7) to (2,9) is |4-2|+|7-9|=2+2=4 steps, so it cannot reach in one turn. So I can safely reach (2,9) in two turns without enemy collision risk.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is better to secure the apple at (2,9).\n\nLEFT",

Apples at: (9,8), (2,0), (9,2), (2,9), (2,3). Enemy snake #0: head at (3,7), body at [(4,7), (4,6), (4,5)], apples: 3.\n\nPossible moves from my head (3,9):\n- UP: (3,10) - off the board (y=10 not allowed), unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,8) - currently empty (see board state: row 8, column 3 is '.'), safe.\n- LEFT: (2,9) - contains an apple (2,9)! Safe to move there (eating apple).\n- RIGHT: (4,9) - my body (first segment), unsafe.\n\nSo only DOWN and LEFT are safe. LEFT leads to an apple.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,9), I eat the apple. My snake will grow by one segment. The new tail will be added at the end (so body becomes [(2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (6,7)] and head at (2,9)). This is safe and beneficial.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,8), I avoid the apple for now. But why delay? The apple is right there.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (3,7). It might also be interested in the apple at (2,9) or (2,3). From (3,7), it can move UP to (3,8), DOWN to (3,6), LEFT to (2,7), or RIGHT to (4,7). If it moves LEFT to (2,7), it is one step away from (2,9) (needs to go UP twice). But I am at (3,9) and can go LEFT to (2,9) this turn. So I can get the apple before the enemy.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,8), the enemy might move UP to (3,8) and cause a head-on collision. So DOWN is risky.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is clearly the best move: it gets me an apple and avoids potential collision with enemy.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,9), my head will be at (2,9) with a longer body. Next turn, I can consider moving DOWN to (2,8) or LEFT to (1,9) (if available) to avoid getting trapped in the corner. But that is for next turn.\n\nPlan for next turns: After eating apple at (2,9), move DOWN to (2,8) to open up options (avoid corner). Then possibly head towards (2,3) apple or others.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy might go UP to (1,8), but it might not. The enemy has other options: it might go DOWN to (1,6) to eat the apple, or LEFT to (0,7). So there is a chance that enemy does not go UP. Also, if enemy goes UP and we collide, I die but so does enemy. However, since I have more apples, I lose. So it's a risk.\n\nBut note: if I go DOWN and enemy goes UP, we both die. But if I go DOWN and enemy goes elsewhere, I am safe. From (1,8), I have more options: next turn, I can go DOWN to (1,7) (but enemy is at (1,7) now, but after move enemy will be elsewhere), or LEFT to (0,8), or RIGHT to (2,8). So multiple options.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (1,6) below. Going DOWN is a step towards that apple.\n\nGiven that enemy has multiple choices (UP, DOWN, LEFT), the probability of enemy going UP is 1/3. So there is a 2/3 chance that DOWN is safe.\n\nMoreover, if enemy goes UP, we both die. But if enemy goes DOWN to (1,6), it eats the apple and grows, but that doesn't kill me.\n\nSo DOWN has a risk, but it leads to more options and towards an apple.\n\nLEFT is safe but leads to a corner with only one move next turn.\n\nTherefore, I prefer DOWN for better future options and towards the apple. The risk of head-on collision is present but not certain.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving DOWN to (1,8), next turn I can go further DOWN to (1,7) if enemy is not there (enemy might move away), or LEFT to (0,8), or RIGHT to (2,8). Then continue to apple at (1,6) or (2,3). Avoid the top-left corner.\n\nSo choose DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

However, I need to be cautious about the enemy snake above me.\n\n**Danger assessment:**\nThe enemy snake is positioned above me with its head at (1, 8). Moving UP would directly enter its territory, potentially leading to a collision. The enemy has a significant advantage (7 apples, longer body), so I should avoid direct confrontation.\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nAll three directions (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe, but RIGHT seems optimal because:\n1. It moves me toward the closest apple at (2, 3) - only 3 moves away\n2. It keeps me in the safe middle/right area away from the enemy's territory\n3. It provides good future mobility with access to multiple apples\n\nDOWN would lead me toward apples at (0, 1) and (2, 0), but those are further away. LEFT would also work but leads to the left edge which might limit future options.\n\n**Future plan:**\nAfter RIGHT, continue toward (2, 3) apple, then consider (2, 0) or (0, 1).

Apples at: (9,8), (2,0), (9,2), (2,3), (0,1). Enemy snake #0: head at (1,6), body at [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7)], apples: 4.\n\nPossible moves from my head (1,8):\n- UP: (1,9) - my body (first segment), unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,7) - enemy snake #0's body (segment at (1,7)), unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,8) - currently empty (see board: row 8, column 0 is '.'), safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,8) - currently empty (row 8, column 2 is '.'), safe.\n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0 at head (1,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (1,7) - its own body, unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,5) - safe (empty).\n- LEFT: (0,6) - safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,6) - safe.\n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8), it is safe. From (0,8), next turn:\n- UP: (0,9) - my body (current segment at (1,9) will become (0,9)? Actually, after I move, my body will shift: head to (0,8), then segments to (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), ... So (0,9) will be empty? Wait, let's simulate:\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (0,8), my new body becomes: head (0,8), then (1,8) (current head), then (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8) and tail (5,7) is lost? Actually, since I didn't eat an apple, I lose the tail. So body: [(0,8), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8)] (length 8, same as before).\n\nSo next turn from (0,8):\n- UP: (0,9) - empty (since current (1,9) is now the second segment, and (0,9) is free).\n- DOWN: (0,7) - empty.\n- LEFT: (-1,8) off board.\n- RIGHT: (1,8) - my body (second segment).\n\nSo UP and DOWN are safe. So two options.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,8), it is safe. From (2,8), next turn:\nAfter moving RIGHT, new body: head (2,8), then (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8) (tail lost).\nNext turn from (2,8):\n- UP: (2,9) - my body (fourth segment? Actually, (2,9) is the third segment: head (2,8), then (1,8), then (1,9), then (2,9), ... so (2,9) is occupied).\n- DOWN: (2,7) - enemy body? Currently enemy has body at (2,7), but enemy will move. After enemy move, it might be free.\n- LEFT: (1,8) - my body (second segment).\n- RIGHT: (3,8) - empty.\n\nSo only RIGHT might be safe? But DOWN might be safe if enemy moves away.\n\nActually, we need to consider the state after both moves.\n\nNow, long-term: There is an apple at (2,3) and (0,1). Going LEFT to (0,8) is closer to (0,1) and also avoids the enemy. Going RIGHT to (2,8) is closer to (2,3).\n\nAlso, enemy is at (1,6) and can move to (1,5), (0,6), or (2,6). So it might block my path later.\n\nI should avoid the enemy since I have more apples (7 vs 4). So prefer moves away from enemy.\n\nGoing LEFT to (0,8) is away from enemy (enemy is at (1,6)), and also towards apple at (0,1).\n\nGoing RIGHT to (2,8) is towards enemy? Actually, enemy is at (1,6), which is below and left. So RIGHT is slightly away.\n\nBut LEFT is better for avoiding head-on collision.\n\nAlso, from (0,8), I have two safe moves next turn (UP and DOWN), which is good.\n\nFrom (2,8), only RIGHT is definitely safe (DOWN depends on enemy move).\n\nSo LEFT is safer and has better future options.\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (0,8), go DOWN to (0,7) (if safe) to approach apple at (0,1). Avoid going UP to (0,9) which might lead to dead-end. Also, watch enemy movement.\n\nLEFT",

The apple at (2, 3) is only 1 move away - I can collect it on the very next turn\n2. This continues my planned path from last turn toward the lower apples\n3. Moving down keeps me away from the enemy snake's territory (top rows 8-9)\n4. Quick apple collection is critical since the enemy has 7 apples vs my 4\n\n**Danger assessment:**\nThe enemy snake remains concentrated in rows 8-9. Moving DOWN keeps me in the safer lower area (rows 3-5). The enemy is far away and doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\nLEFT would move me to (1, 5), which is safe but doesn't lead directly to any nearby apples. RIGHT would move me to (3, 5), also safe but further from immediate apple opportunities.\n\n**Future plan:**\nContinue the strategy from last turn: Move DOWN to (2, 4), then next turn move DOWN again to (2, 3) to collect the apple. After that, continue toward (2, 0) for another quick apple. This path gives me the fastest route to catching up in score while staying in safe territory.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nTurn 23: My snake (ID 1) has head at (0,7) (after moving DOWN last turn) and body at [(0,8), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9)] (length 8 segments including head). Apples at: (9,8), (2,0), (9,2), (2,3), (0,1). Enemy snake #0: head at (2,5), body at [(2,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7)], apples: 4.\n\nPossible moves from my head (0,7):\n- UP: (0,8) - my body (second segment), unsafe.\n- DOWN: (0,6) - currently empty (see board: row 6, column 0 is '.'), safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,7) - off board, unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,7) - currently empty (row 7, column 1 is '.'), safe.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0 at head (2,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (2,6) - its own body, unsafe.\n- DOWN: (2,4) - safe (empty).\n- LEFT: (1,5) - safe (empty).\n- RIGHT: (3,5) - safe (empty).\n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nLong-term: There is an apple at (0,1) below me. Going DOWN to (0,6) gets me closer to that apple. Going RIGHT to (1,7) moves me horizontally and might be useful for accessing other apples later, but (0,1) is the closest apple.\n\nFrom (0,6) next turn:\n- UP: (0,7) - my body? After moving DOWN, my new body: head (0,6), then (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9) (tail lost). So (0,7) is my second segment, unsafe.\n- DOWN: (0,5) - empty.\n- LEFT: off board.\n- RIGHT: (1,6) - currently empty? But enemy has body at (1,6) which is static? Actually, enemy body is at [(2,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7)] and enemy head is at (2,5). So (1,6) is enemy body and won't move unless enemy moves. So (1,6) is unsafe next turn? But wait: enemy moves simultaneously, so after enemy moves, its body might shift. However, (1,6) is the third segment of enemy, so it will remain there unless enemy eats an apple? Enemy has 4 apples, so length 5 segments. So enemy body is fixed: head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7). So (1,6) is occupied by enemy body and will remain so next turn. Therefore, RIGHT from (0,6) to (1,6) is unsafe next turn.\n\nSo from (0,6), only DOWN is safe next turn? (UP unsafe, LEFT unsafe, RIGHT unsafe due to enemy body). So going DOWN to (0,6) leads to only one safe move next turn (DOWN again).\n\nFrom (1,7) next turn:\n- UP: (1,8) - my body (fourth segment), unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,6) - enemy body, unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,7) - my body (second segment), unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (2,7) - enemy body, unsafe.\n\nSo no safe moves from (1,7) next turn! Therefore, going RIGHT to (1,7) is a dead-end.\n\nThus, only DOWN is viable to keep options open. From (0,6), we can only go DOWN to (0,5), but that at least keeps us moving towards the apple at (0,1). We might need to plan an escape route later, but for now, DOWN is the only safe move that doesn't lead to immediate death next turn.\n\nPlan: Go DOWN to (0,6) to approach apple at (0,1). Next turn, we must go DOWN again to (0,5). We need to be cautious as we are moving into a narrow corridor. Consider if we can break out later by turning right at (0,1) or (0,0)? But (0,0) is bottom left and might be risky. Alternatively, after eating the apple at (0,1), we grow and might have more flexibility. But for now, avoid RIGHT which leads to certain death next turn.\n\nDOWN",

Apples at: (9,8), (2,0), (9,2), (0,1), (4,1). Enemy snake #0: head at (2,3), body at [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,7)], apples: 5.\n\nPossible moves from my head (0,5):\n- UP: (0,6) - my body (second segment), unsafe.\n- DOWN: (0,4) - currently empty (see board: row 4, column 0 is '.'), safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,5) - off board, unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,5) - currently empty (see board: row 5, column 1 is '.'), safe.\n\nSo safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's evaluate:\n- DOWN (0,4): This continues our path downward toward the apple at (0,1). However, we are moving along the left edge (x=0) which is narrow. After moving to (0,4), next moves would likely be DOWN to (0,3), then (0,2), (0,1) to eat the apple. But after eating, we will grow and be even longer in this column, which might trap us. Also, the enemy snake is at (2,3) and might move toward us? But currently, it is two cells away horizontally.\n- RIGHT (1,5): This moves us away from the edge and opens up more options. From (1,5), we can go UP to (1,6) (but note enemy body at (1,6)? Actually, enemy body has (1,6) and (1,7), so (1,6) is unsafe), DOWN to (1,4) (empty), LEFT to (0,5) (my body? but we are moving away so it might be safe next turn? Actually, after moving RIGHT, our body will shift: head to (1,5), then segments to (0,5), (0,6), etc. So (0,5) becomes our second segment next turn, so going LEFT from (1,5) to (0,5) would be into our own body and unsafe next turn. Similarly, RIGHT to (2,5) might be safe? But enemy body has (2,5) and (2,6), so (2,5) is unsafe.\n\nWait, let's check the board for (1,5): it is currently '.' (empty). But we need to consider future safety and options.\n\nActually, going RIGHT to (1,5) is safe this turn. But next turn, from (1,5), our possible moves:\n- UP: (1,6) - enemy body (snake #0 has segment at (1,6)), unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,4) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (0,5) - will be our own body (second segment) next turn, unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (2,5) - enemy body (snake #0 has segment at (2,5)), unsafe.\n\nSo only DOWN would be safe from (1,5). That means going RIGHT now would lead to only one safe move next turn (DOWN), which is risky.\n\nNow, going DOWN to (0,4):\nNext turn from (0,4):\n- UP: (0,5) - will be our second segment (since we move to (0,4), body becomes [(0,5), (0,6), ...]), unsafe.\n- DOWN: (0,3) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: off board, unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,4) - empty, safe.\n\nSo two safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. This gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is better because it keeps more options open next turn.\n\nAlso, we are moving toward the apple at (0,1). We can plan to eat that apple in a few turns: (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1). After eating, we grow and our tail will extend, but we can then break right at (0,1) to (1,1) or at (0,0) to (1,0) to avoid being trapped.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,3). It might move down to (2,2) or left to (1,3) or right to (3,3). But it is not an immediate threat to us.\n\nSo, DOWN is the best choice to maintain flexibility and progress toward the apple.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue down to (0,4), then (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) to eat the apple. After eating, break right to (1,1) or (1,0) to avoid being trapped in the left column. Monitor enemy movement, especially if it comes closer.\n\nDOWN",

However, the enemy seems to be moving UP/EAST based on their current body formation, not likely to interfere with my immediate path.\n\n**Future planning:**\nContinue my established plan: move DOWN to (2, 1), then next turn DOWN again to (2, 0) to collect the apple.

But even if it moves LEFT to (1,2), it is still one cell away from our RIGHT move (1,4) and not an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, going DOWN to (0,3) is safer because it keeps us on the edge and away from the enemy.

(0,0) is safe and gives us options to move right along the bottom row. (1,1) is also safe and opens up more central moves. After eating, we should avoid getting trapped in the corner.

After that, I should consider the cluster of apples at (5, 7) and (5, 8), while keeping an eye on the enemy's position. I need to catch up since I'm trailing 6-8 in apples.

Next turn from (1,2):\n  - UP: (1,3) - empty (safe)\n  - DOWN: (1,1) - will be my second segment (unsafe)\n  - LEFT: (0,2) - my body (unsafe)\n  - RIGHT: (2,2) - enemy body (snake #0 has segment at (2,2)), unsafe\n  Only one safe move: UP. This leads to a path with limited options.\n\n- DOWN (1,0): Moves south. Next turn from (1,0):\n  - UP: (1,1) - will be my second segment (unsafe)\n  - DOWN: off board (unsafe)\n  - LEFT: (0,0) - empty (safe)\n  - RIGHT: (2,0) - enemy body (snake #0 has segment at (2,0)), unsafe\n  Only one safe move: LEFT to (0,0). This is also restrictive.\n\nBoth moves lead to only one safe option next turn, which is risky. However, UP is preferable because:\n1. It moves away from the enemy snake (which is at y=0 and y=1) and towards the center of the board.\n2. There are apples at higher y-coordinates (e.g., (5,7), (5,8), (9,8)) that I can eventually reach.\n3. Moving DOWN to (1,0) puts me on the bottom edge with fewer escape routes.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (3,1) has possible moves:\n- UP: (3,2) - empty (safe)\n- DOWN: (3,0) - its own body (unsafe)\n- LEFT: (2,1) - its own body (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (4,1) - empty (safe) and has an apple at (4,1)\nSo it will likely go UP or RIGHT. It may go RIGHT to eat the apple at (4,1). This doesn't directly threaten me at (1,1).\n\nLong-term plan: Move north to avoid the enemy and seek apples in the upper half. From (1,2), I must go UP to (1,3) next turn. Then I can consider moving east or west to avoid dead-ends. The enemy is focused on the apple at (4,1), giving me time to maneuver.\n\nUP",

While this is possible, snake #0 has other options and might not choose LEFT.\n\nLong-term strategy: I need to continue moving toward the apples at (5, 7) and (5, 8). Moving RIGHT to (4, 4) gets me closer to these apples. However, I should consider avoiding the potential collision risk with snake #0.\n\nAlternative: Moving UP to (3, 5) or DOWN to (3, 3) are also safe and avoid the immediate collision risk. But UP moves me away from the apples, and DOWN doesn't progress me effectively.\n\nRIGHT is still the best choice as it directly progresses me toward the apple cluster. The risk of head-on collision is moderate but acceptable given the strategic importance of moving east. Snake #0 might choose UP or RIGHT instead of LEFT.\n\nPlan for next turns: Continue moving east toward the apples at (5,7) and (5,8), but be cautious of enemy snake #0 which is also in the area. Consider alternative paths if the risk becomes too high.\n\nRIGHT",
