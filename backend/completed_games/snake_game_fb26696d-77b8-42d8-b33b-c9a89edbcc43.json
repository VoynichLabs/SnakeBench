Analyze Immediate Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 1))**\n\nPossible next head positions (current move -> new head):\n*   UP -> (9, 2)\n*   DOWN -> (9, 0)\n*   LEFT -> (8, 1)\n*   RIGHT -> (10, 1) (Out of bounds)\n\n**A. Check for Self-Collision/Boundary:**\n*   UP (9, 2): Safe.\n*   DOWN (9, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT (8, 1): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (10, 1): Invalid (Off board).\n\nRemaining safe moves based on self-check: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**B. Check for Enemy Collision (Snake 0 at (6, 1)):**\nSnake 0 moves simultaneously. We must predict Snake 0's move relative to our new position. Since Snake 0 has no body, only head collisions matter right now.\n\nSnake 1 potential new positions: (9, 2), (9, 0), (8, 1).\nSnake 0 potential next heads (assuming safe moves for Snake 0):\nSnake 0 has ample space. Let's look at apples relative to Snake 0: (2, 7), (2, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 6). Snake 0 is closest to (7, 4) or (8, 4).\n\nIf Snake 1 moves to P1, and Snake 0 moves to P0:\n*   P1 = P0 results in mutual death.\n\nSince we don't know Snake 0's move, we must assess the risk. Snake 0 is at (6, 1).\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (7, 1), and we move LEFT to (8, 1), we are safe.\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (6, 2), we are safe regardless of our move.\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (6, 0), we are safe regardless of our move.\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (5, 1), we are safe regardless of our move.\n\nHead-on collision is only possible if our move puts us in the same cell as Snake 0's chosen destination. Snake 0 is far enough away (3 units difference in X) that direct head-on collision based on immediate adjacency is impossible this turn, as the minimum distance Snake 0 could move toward us is 1 unit, leaving a distance of 2 or 3 between heads.\n\nDistance between heads: $\\sqrt{(9-6)^2 + (1-1)^2} = 3$. They cannot collide head-on this turn.\n\n**C. Evaluating Target Apples and Positioning:**\n\nOur head is far right/low.\nClosest Apples:\n1. (8, 4) - Distance 4 moves (3 right, 3 up seems blocked by edge, must go Left/Down). (9, 1) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 4). Requires 3 moves minimum, but we are cornered.\n2. (7, 4) - Distance 4 moves.\n3. (2, 3) - Distance 7 moves.\n\nSnake 0 is closer to the cluster of apples around (7, 4) and (8, 4).\n\nOur current position (9, 1) is the right edge. We must move away from the edge to gain mobility and approach apples.\n\n*   **UP (9, 2):** Moves toward the center, stays safe on the right edge. Keeps options open for moving LEFT on the next turn to pursue (8, 4) or (7, 4).\n*   **DOWN (9, 0):** Moves to the bottom edge. Highly restrictive. If we move LEFT next, we are immediately restricted to going up. Less flexible pathing.\n*   **LEFT (8, 1):** Moves one step closer to the center and the apples. This seems slightly more aggressive toward the central cluster of apples around X=7, 8.\n\nComparing UP and LEFT:\nMoving LEFT (8, 1) is a direct step towards the nearest potential apple target (8, 4). If Snake 0 focuses on (7, 4), we might still be able to compete for (8, 4) or move toward (2, 3) or (2, 7).\n\nIf we move UP to (9, 2), we still need a LEFT move next turn to start closing the horizontal gap. Moving LEFT immediately covers one unit of the gap.\n\nLet's check the path if we choose LEFT:\nTurn 0: S1 moves LEFT to (8, 1).\nTurn 1 possibilities for S1 (if S0 doesn't block):\n*   UP to (8, 2)\n*   DOWN to (8, 0)\n*   LEFT to (7, 1)\n\nThis path seems to open up mobility better than staying on the right wall by moving UP. Moving UP keeps us at X=9, which is generally bad when the action is centered around X=4 to X=7.\n\n**Strategy:** Move towards the nearest cluster of apples (around X=7, Y=4) by reducing the X coordinate gap. LEFT seems the best direction to improve mobility away from the extreme corner.\n\nLong-term Note: Try to reach the apples at (8, 4) or (7, 4) without entering a high-risk area or getting boxed in by the edge walls. Snake 0 is likely aiming for (7, 4). We must secure an apple quickly.\n\n**Decision:** LEFT\nDirection chosen: LEFT",

Backwards move is (9, 1). Safe.\n*   RIGHT (9, 1): **Collision** with own body segment [(9, 1)]. This move is invalid.\n\nRemaining safe moves based on self-check: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**B. Check for Enemy Collision (Snake 0 at (6, 0), Body at (6, 1)):**\nSnake 0 is trying to move away from its previous position (6, 1). It is currently at (6, 0).\nSnake 0 potential next heads:\n*   If S0 moves UP: (6, 1) -> Collision with own body segment (6, 1). If the head moves onto a body segment, the snake dies. If S0 moves UP, its head moves to (6, 1), which is its *previous tail position*. Since S0 did not eat an apple last turn, its body length remains 1, and its previous head position (6, 1) is now its body segment. **If S0 moves UP, S0 dies due to self-collision.**\n*   If S0 moves DOWN: (6, -1). Out of bounds. S0 dies.\n*   If S0 moves LEFT: (5, 0). Safe.\n*   If S0 moves RIGHT: (7, 0). Safe.\n\nSince moves UP and DOWN result in guaranteed death for Snake 0, we only need to worry about S0 moving LEFT to (5, 0) or RIGHT to (7, 0).\n\nSnake 1 potential destinations: (8, 2), (8, 0), (7, 1).\nSnake 0 potential destinations: (5, 0), (7, 0).\n\nNo immediate head-on or body collision is possible since heads are too far separated (minimum distance 2 units: 8 vs 7).\n\n**C. Evaluating Target Apples and Positioning:**\nApples nearby: (8, 4) and (7, 4).\nHead is at (8, 1). We need to move UP toward X=4.\n\n*   **UP (8, 2):** Moves directly towards (8, 4). Path: (8, 1) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 4) (Apple). This seems like the most direct route to the nearest apple cluster.\n*   **DOWN (8, 0):** Moves to the edge, delaying access to apples. Unfavorable.\n*   **LEFT (7, 1):** Moves horizontally toward (7, 4), but still requires a significant vertical climb. If S0 moves to (7, 0) or (5, 0), our LEFT move (7, 1) puts us somewhat close to S0 horizontally, but S0 is still far below us vertically.\n\nPath UP seems excellent. It targets the apple at (8, 4) in 3 moves if unimpeded. Snake 0 is currently low on the board (Y=0) and far left (X=6). It will take S0 time to reach the apples at Y=4.\n\n**Strategy:** Since we have a clear path to the nearest apple (8, 4) by moving UP, we should prioritize this direct path. We also established that Snake 0 is likely to die or move away from our path this turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (For reference next turn):** Continue moving UP towards (8, 4). If (8, 4) is reached, immediately look for (7, 4). Maintain vertical movement until the apple region is secured.\n\n**Decision:** UP\n\n**Prediction of Enemy Move (S0):** S0 is at (6, 0), body (6, 1). It is likely to move RIGHT (7, 0) or LEFT (5, 0) to continue developing its body or move towards the center. If S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 0), it moves closer to the apples we target, but still separated. Our UP move is safe.\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**START NEXT MOVE PICK**\nUP\n**END NEXT MOVE PICK**\n\n**START NEXT RATIONALE**\nSNAKE 1 (Head: (8, 2), Body: [(8, 1), (9, 1)], Apples: 0)\nSNAKE 0 (Head: (7, 0), Body: [(6, 0)], Apples: 0)\nApples: (8, 6), (2, 7), (8, 4), (2, 3), (7, 4)\nBoard Size: 10x10\n\n**1. Analyze Immediate Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 2))**\n\nPrevious move was UP. Body is now [(8, 2), (8, 1), (9, 1)].

Backwards move is (8, 1). Safe.\n*   RIGHT (9, 2): Safe. Backwards move is (8, 1). Safe.\n\nRemaining safe moves based on self-check: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**B. Check for Enemy Collision (Snake 0 at (7, 0), Body at (6, 0)):**\nSnake 0 moved RIGHT last turn. It is now at (7, 0), body at (6, 0). Snake 0's effective length is 2 now, since its head landed on the tile where its body used to be (6, 1) -> (6, 0) and then it moved (7, 0). Wait, Snake 0 had body (6, 1). It moved RIGHT to (7, 0). Body is now [(7, 0), (6, 0)].\n\nIf S0 moves:\n*   UP to (7, 1): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (7, -1): Out of bounds. S0 dies.\n*   LEFT to (6, 0): **Collision** with own body segment [(6, 0)]. S0 dies.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 0): Safe.\n\nSnake 1 potential destinations: (8, 3), (7, 2), (9, 2).\nSnake 0 potential destinations: (7, 1), (8, 0).\n\nNo immediate head-on or body collision is possible as the closest points are (8, 2) vs (7, 1) or (8, 0).\n\n**C. Evaluating Target Apples and Positioning:**\nTarget Apple: (8, 4). We are at (8, 2). 2 moves remain to reach it if we go UP.\n\n*   **UP (8, 3):** Continues direct path to (8, 4). This is the highest priority unless danger arises. If nothing happens, we eat the apple next turn.\n*   **LEFT (7, 2):** Moves toward (7, 4). This means we abandon the direct path to (8, 4) for a path to (7, 4), which is still beneficial. It also moves us horizontally away from the edge.\n*   **RIGHT (9, 2):** Moves back towards the edge. Unfavorable.\n\nComparing UP and LEFT: UP is maximally efficient to an apple we identified previously. Since S0 is currently very low (Y=0), moving UP maximizes our vertical progress without immediate threat.\n\nSnake 0 seems to be maneuvering to avoid suicide moves. If S0 moves UP to (7, 1), it is still far below us. If S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 0), it is extremely close to our current Y-level, but 1 unit left. If we move UP, we remain safe.\n\n**Strategy:** UP towards (8, 4). This path is clearly defined and safe for at least one more turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (For reference next turn):** If we reach (8, 4), we eat the apple, grow, and then immediately assess our position relative to (7, 4). We must ensure we don't get stuck against the top wall (Y=9) if we keep going up.\n\n**Decision:** UP\nUP\n**END NEXT RATIONALE**",
