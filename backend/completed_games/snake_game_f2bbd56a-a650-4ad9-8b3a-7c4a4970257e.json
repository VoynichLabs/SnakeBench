No risk of collision this turn because enemy is far.  \n\n**Future safety considerations:**  \nGoing UP now to (7, 4) is fine.

That\u2019s far from me.  \n\nSo all my moves safe now, but UP is toward nearest apple.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nMove toward (7, 7) while checking enemy\u2019s possible path \u2014 enemy may go for (1, 8) first, giving me time to grab (7, 7). After eating, my body will be at (7, 3) so avoid doubling back into it.  \n\n**Move choice:**  \nUP  \n\nUP",

Opens fewer mid-game options vs. lateral moves.\n- DOWN to (2,7): Heads south, opens wide space, could veer east later or aim for (3,0) or south apples like (7,4)\u2014but enemy in column 7 might eat (7,4) easily (DOWN to (7,5), then (7,4) on next turn), or block. Increases options but doesn't advance towards nearby eastern apples fast enough.\n- RIGHT to (3,8): Advances east (towards apples at (7,9), (7,7)), keeps me in open row, flexible for UP/DOWN/RIGHT follow-ups. Positions for future east movement to column 7 (about 4-5 more RIGHTs to reach). Avoids column 7 enemy zone for now, letting me flank.\n\nAmong safe moves, RIGHT dominates: Maximizes future mobility, closes gap to eastern apples without immediate risk, and aligns with prior plan to vie for column 7 before enemy grabs more. Enemy might eat (7,7) if UP, but RIGHT gets me to (4,8 next, etc.), then up to (7,9) if they focus south. If enemy stalls or goes south, I gain ground.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue RIGHT for 4-5 more turns to reach x=7 at y=8, then evaluate: If (7,9) avail and enemy isn't there (e.g., if they ate (7,4) and grew but stayed south), go UP to (7,9) for the apple. If enemy at (7,7) or moving north, go DOWN to (7,7) if still there, or veer DOWN to y=7 for space. Monitor enemy growth\u2014aim for 2-3 more apples before them, using body to subtly block paths if they pursue east. Fall back south to (3,0) or (9,0) if east gets contested. Stay 3+ cells from enemy head to avoid head-ons; pivot DOWN if they block column 7 upward.\n\nRIGHT",

Next moves from (7,7): UP to (7,8) toward (7,9) apple, DOWN back to (7,6) hits body (dead), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7). So 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n- DOWN to (7,5): no apple, then next turn from (7,5) can go to (7,4) apple below, but enemy could be moving closer. Less immediate reward.  \n- LEFT to (6,6): no apple, moves away from apples at (7,7) and (7,9).  \n- RIGHT to (8,6): no apple, moves away from those apples.  \n\nBest move: UP to eat apple and grow, staying in a relatively open area.  \n\n**Enemy considerations:**  \nEnemy is at (2,8) with apple count 1, length 2. It might aim for apple at (7,9) later but it\u2019s far.  \nBy moving UP now, I claim (7,7) apple and can race to (7,9) next turn if safe.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (7,7), go UP to (7,8) if clear, then to (7,9) apple.

Enemy has grown, likely ate (7,7) last turn (though not in current apple list, perhaps oversight), now a greater threat in column 7.\n\nEliminating invalid moves:\n- LEFT to (2,8): Hits my own body\u2014suicide.\n- Other directions: UP to (3,9): empty, row 9 allows LEFT/RIGHT but limited space, ok for now.\n- RIGHT to (4,8): empty, safe.\n- DOWN to (3,7): empty, safe.\n\nNo immediate collisions; enemy head at (7,7), not adjacent, but they could move UP to (7,8) or elsewhere this turn, potentially blocking paths later. Enemy might go UP to (7,8) or to (7,9) for apple, or RIGHT to (8,7), or LEFT to (6,7). They prioritize the (7,9) apple or column 7 south like (7,5)/(7,4). I have parity in apples but enemy longer body now adds blocking risks; can't mirror head-on.\n\nSafe moves analysis:\n- UP to (3,9): Hauls me higher, closer to row 9 apple path (RIGHT to (7,9) would take multiple turns), but traps me in narrower top-half board if enemy comes in. If enemy goes elsewhere, I could pivot south later, but risks backup if they approach (7,8). Opens Row 9 for LEFT/RIGHT, but less flexibility mid-board.\n- DOWN to (3,7): Drops to mid-board (y=7), widens mobility east/west/south, could loop around to column 7 lower parts (7,5)/(7,4) with more space, outflanking enemy in upper column 7. Positions better for body avoidance and multiple escapes, though stalls eastern progress slightly. If enemy stays north, this probes south apples faster.\n- RIGHT to (4,8): Follows last plan, advances x-coordinate to eventually (7,8), keeping high altitude for (7,9) apple buzz. Maintains direct column 8 east path, flexible for DOWN later into enemy territory. Keeps distance from enemy head, avoiding traps. If enemy goes UP, I might reach (7,8) before them and snag (7,9); worst case, retreat south.\n\nAmong safe, DOWN tempts for broader options and southern apple potential\u2014enemy at (7,7) might spur south, letting me flank to (7,4)/(7,5) from y=7 (RIGHT to x=7 at y=7 takes ~4 turns, then down). But my last plan prioritized eastern route at y=8 to vie for (7,9) before enemy eats it (they could UP-UP to eat it Turn 5-6). Enemy might stall or not eat (7,9) quickly, so continuing RIGHT closes gap efficiently without immediate suicide risk. DOWN scatters momentum; RIGHT maximizes progress to key upper apples with escape above enemy zone.\n\nUltrathink: Enemy 2-segments, body at (7,6) means they can't reverse south immediately. If they go UP to (7,8), I can't hit (7,8) same turn (too far), but avoid it future turns. Long-term, flank south if east contested; DOWN now sets up stronger southern pursuit but delays eastern push where I have initiative. RIGHT keeps plan alive, heads off potential rush to (7,9). Estimated: (7,9) reachable in ~4 MORE RIGHTs to x=7, then UP. If enemy focuses south, eat upper apple first, restrict them.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue RIGHT along y=8 to x=7; there, if (7,9) is unguarded (enemy at (7,7) likely stayed or went south), go UP to eat it and grow. If not, go DOWN to (7,7)\u2014if apple gone but safe\u2014or further to y=6/5 for (7,5)/(7,4) apples, using y=7 area for safety/buffer from enemy body. If enemy chases east high, pivot DOWN early to y=7 route (via one DOWN now, or at x=6-7). Outwit by mirroring distance (3+ cells from their head); aim for 2 apples before their 2nd extra. Watch their growth\u2014force them into length-bound traps south while snagging edges. If overwhelmed east, fallback to (9,0)/(3,0) via south.\n\nRIGHT",

So 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:**\nEnemy might go UP to (3,9) or RIGHT to (4,8). From (3,9), next turn it could go LEFT to (2,9) or DOWN to (3,8) (its old head pos) etc. But it\u2019s far from me now.\n\n**Best choice:**\nUP to (7,8) gets me closer to apple (7,9) and keeps more options open toward top side, which has fewer apples but more space.  \nGoing LEFT or RIGHT doesn\u2019t get me closer to any apple immediately, and the enemy is far left, so moving left might not be dangerous but also not beneficial.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,8), if safe, go UP to (7,9) to eat apple. Check enemy position then \u2014 if enemy might also go to (7,9) next turn?

Length 3 (2 apples collected).  \n- Enemy snake (ID 1): head at (4,7), body at (4,8). Length 2 (1 apple collected).  \n\n**Apples:** (3,0), (9,0), (7,4), (7,5), (1,1).  \n\n---\n\n**1. Check possible moves from (7,9):**  \n- **UP**: to (7,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: to (7,8) \u2192 occupied by my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: to (6,9) \u2192 empty in board state.  \n- **RIGHT**: to (8,9) \u2192 empty in board state.  \n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are safe from immediate self-collision/off-board.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Consider enemy snake\u2019s possible moves from (4,7):**  \nEnemy body at (4,8) above its head, so it cannot move UP (into its own body).  \nPossible moves for enemy: DOWN to (4,6), LEFT to (3,7), RIGHT to (5,7).  \n\nNo immediate collision with me unless our heads choose same cell this turn.  \n- If I go LEFT to (6,9), enemy can\u2019t reach there. Safe.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (8,9), enemy can\u2019t reach there. Safe.  \n\nSo both LEFT and RIGHT avoid head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Future safety / apple proximity:**  \nApples closest to me:  \n- (7,4), (7,5) are directly below me but far (distance 4\u20135 steps).  \n- (9,0), (3,0), (1,1) are far away.  \n\nFrom (6,9):  \n- Next moves: UP off board, DOWN to (6,8) (free), LEFT to (5,9) (free), RIGHT back to (7,9) (occupied by my body next turn? Not exactly, body moves forward, so (7,9) will be empty next turn? Let\u2019s check: If I move LEFT to (6,9), my body becomes [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8)], so (7,9) is my neck, not free next turn. Actually wait \u2014 next turn my head at (6,9), body: old head (7,9) becomes segment 2, old (7,8) becomes segment 3, so (7,9) is occupied by my body next turn, so moving RIGHT next turn from (6,9) would be into own body.)  \n\nFrom (8,9):  \n- Next moves: UP off board, DOWN to (8,8) free, LEFT to (7,9) (occupied by my body next turn? Let\u2019s check: If I move RIGHT now to (8,9), body becomes [(8,9), (7,9), (7,8)], so (7,9) is occupied next turn, so LEFT from (8,9) next turn is invalid). So both LEFT and RIGHT from current head lead to having only 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN and the other horizontal direction not into own neck).  \n\nActually let\u2019s check carefully:  \n\n**If I go LEFT to (6,9):**  \nBody next turn: head (6,9), then (7,9), then (7,8), tail (7,7) gone (since length 3).  \nNext turn from (6,9):  \n- UP: (6,10) off board \u2192 no.  \n- DOWN: (6,8) empty \u2192 yes.  \n- LEFT: (5,9) empty \u2192 yes.  \n- RIGHT: (7,9) my body \u2192 no.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**If I go RIGHT to (8,9):**  \nBody next turn: head (8,9), then (7,9), then (7,8).  \nNext turn from (8,9):  \n- UP off board \u2192 no.  \n- DOWN: (8,8) empty \u2192 yes.  \n- LEFT: (7,9) my body \u2192 no.  \n- RIGHT: (9,9) empty \u2192 yes.  \nAlso 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo equal immediate future options.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apple strategy:**  \nGoing LEFT or RIGHT doesn\u2019t get me much closer to apples immediately, but maybe LEFT gets me toward center (more future flexibility) while RIGHT gets me toward edge. Edge is riskier because fewer escape routes.  \n\nAlso enemy is at (4,7), far from me now, but if I go RIGHT to (8,9), I\u2019m near right wall with only DOWN or RIGHT next turn. That\u2019s slightly more restrictive.  \n\nLEFT to (6,9) gives me DOWN or LEFT next turn, both open.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term plan:**  \nNeed to start moving toward apples (7,4)/(7,5) or (1,1)/(3,0) eventually. Right now safest is to keep central options open.  \n\n---\n\n**6.

Enemy snake (#0): head at (7,9), body [(7,8), (7,7)], length 3, apples 2. Apples at (3,0), (9,0), (1,1), (7,4), (7,5). Enemy at top-left corner, likely forced to move LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT to (8,9) this turn (can't move DOWN into own body or UP off-board), so they'll pivot eastward/westward without immediate southward threat. This gives me initiative to advance east before they can descend and contest column 7 apples at (7,4)/(7,5).\n\nValid moves from (4,7):\n- UP to (4,8): Hits own body (directly behind head), suicide\u2014eliminate.\n- DOWN to (4,6): Empty, safe; lowers to y=6 for southward options, but delays eastward progress and keeps me farther from column 7 (x=7), allowing enemy to potentially loop around and undercut my flank faster than my longer x-travel path.\n- LEFT to (3,7): Empty, safe; heads west, away from apples, reduces options by pushing toward board edge, and prolongs route to x=7 (would need to swing right later, e.g., from (3,6) onward\u2014extra turns), letting enemy consolidate position.\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Empty, safe; advances east to x=5 at y=7, narrowing x-gap to enemy column (now only 2 cells: x=5 to x=7), maintains high mobility at mid-board y=7, and aligns with last turn's plan to position for RIGHT to (6,7) next turn then downward southern paths to (7,5)/(7,4) (e.g., via y=7 to y=6, avoiding enemy body at (7,7)). This keeps multiple follow-ups (DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT later), moves closer to reachable apples (7-column stack at y=4-5, ~4-5 turns away once at x=6), and outwits enemy by preempting their likely horizontal shift (LEFT/RIGHT) while I build eastward momentum\u2014they'll need detours to pursue south, giving me a 1-2 turn head start on south apples. No head-on risk this turn (enemy's head move won't overlap (5,7)). Enemy at length 3 with apple lead of 1; I must eat soon to par or surpass (e.g., snag (7,5) next cycle). Keeps future options open by staying central, avoiding dead-end west pushes or y-lock downs.\n\nUltrathink on enemy: Head at (7,9), must LEFT/RIGHT; if LEFT to (6,9), they'll descend y=8-7 next (body at (7,8) blocks direct y=8 entry), potentially meeting me at x=6-7 later\u2014but my RIGHT here nudges me closer first, forcing them to react. RIGHT to (8,9) might aim for top-edge evasion, buying time but isolating them north. No crash risks; this move scatters their positioning while I flank south under-length advantage. Prioritizes RIGHT for apple access, evasion, and outlasting via safe, adaptive mid-board control.\n\nLong-term plan for next few turns: RIGHT to (5,7), RIGHT to (6,7) next, then DOWN to (6,6)/(6,5) to position at y=5-6 for RIGHT to (7,5) or (7,4) (eat apple, grow). Watch enemy descent\u2014skip/apple-grab if they lunge LEFT-down toward x=6-7; retreat LEFT to x=4-5 at y=6-5 if blocked; fallback DOWN-south for (3,0)/(9,0) parity catchup.

Wait, let\u2019s think: enemy length is 2, so his body is only [(5, 7)] now. If enemy moves LEFT to (5, 7), his head goes into his own body? That\u2019s suicide for him, so he won\u2019t do that. So likely enemy will move UP, RIGHT, or DOWN from (6, 7) to avoid dying.  \n\nLet\u2019s check enemy\u2019s safe moves from (6, 7):  \nHis body is at (5, 7). Possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (6, 8) currently my head, but I will move away. If I move DOWN to (6, 7), he moves UP to (6, 8), we swap positions? No, simultaneous: I go to (6, 7), he goes to (6, 8).

However, moving DOWN into (6, 7) after enemy leaves is safe. But what if enemy stays? He can\u2019t stay because staying means choosing not to move, not allowed \u2014 he must pick a direction. So he will leave (6, 7). So DOWN is safe.  \n\nBut careful: if enemy moves UP to (6, 8) and I move DOWN to (6, 7), we just swap places, fine.  \n\nSo DOWN is safe from immediate death.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 empty now, safe from collision this turn.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 8) \u2192 empty now, safe.  \n\nSo all except UP are safe for immediate death check.\n\n---\n\n**2. Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy at (6, 7) could move UP to (6, 8) if I move LEFT or RIGHT \u2014 then no issue. If I move DOWN to (6, 7) and he moves UP to (6, 8), fine.  \n\nBut head-on collision happens if we choose the same destination cell from different starts. That\u2019s impossible here because we are adjacent now: my head (6, 8), his head (6, 7). The only shared adjacent cell is (6, 8) for me staying still (not possible) or (6, 7) for him staying still (not possible). So no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**3.

Apple proximity:**  \nApples at (7, 4), (7, 5) are below-right.  \nFrom (6, 8):  \nDOWN gets me closer in y-direction (7 vs 8).  \nLEFT takes me farther away.  \nRIGHT takes me to (7, 8) then need to go down.  \n\nSo DOWN is best for apples.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy blocking:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (6, 7), enemy likely moves UP/RIGHT/DOWN. If enemy goes UP to (6, 8), then next turn he\u2019s above me, I\u2019m at (6, 7). I could go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to avoid him and get apples.  \n\nEnemy might also go for apples, but he\u2019s shorter (length 2) so less body to maneuver.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nMove DOWN toward apples (7, 4)/(7, 5). Keep enemy in mind \u2014 if he\u2019s above me, I can go down/left to avoid confrontation while progressing to apples. Avoid getting trapped in bottom-left unless necessary.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN gives best apple proximity, 3 safe moves next turn, avoids immediate death, no head-on risk.  \n\nDOWN",
