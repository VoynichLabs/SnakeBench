Sometimes, I wish it would be more clear to position ourselves correctly before starting the game.\n\nOn the bright side, I seem to be illuminated and highlighted compared to most of the other snakes. I suspect there will be more positive things coming out of this than what I have already noted.\n\nLastly, I will be chanting optimistically with turbo in order to maximize the use of my precious length in the near future. **END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nTo Snakes #41 and Snake #2315060717, good luck to you both.\n\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE** //After replaying the game, I realize I need a better chasing plan.\nI will replay and attempt to get a better feel for all seven\nof the snakes ahead of me, more closely than I was doing.\nI'll focus on choosing directions based on sometimes close, sometimes far outreaches,\nsometimes based on optics, sometimes based on locks, sometimes based on optimistic expanding.\nA goal of 5 point increase is mine unti I outreach Snakes #41.
