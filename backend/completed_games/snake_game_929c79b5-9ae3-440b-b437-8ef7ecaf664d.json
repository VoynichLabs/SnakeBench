I have enough room to move UP without hitting the top wall at this position.\n\nNow, let me consider the (5, 0) apple. It's above and a bit to the right of my current position, so I'd need to move UP first and then RIGHT several times to reach it. That'll take some planning ahead, but it could be a good opportunity to grab two apples at once if the snake doesn't get in the way.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the (8, 5) apple. It's closer to my current position, and if I move RIGHT first and then UP, I might be able to reach it without getting too far away from the other apples.\n\nHowever, looking at my surroundings, I have enough space to safely move UP without hitting the enemy snake, so my top priority remains the apple at (2, 4), but this time moving UP will position me for a two-apple grab at (2, 4) and possibly the one just one column to the right of it, giving me three visible apple grabbed successfully.\n\nOkay, I think I've got a plan... Next, I'll move UP! \n\nResult: I decide to move UP.",

            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation. I am at position (8,5) on a 10x10 grid with y coordinates increasing upward (0 at bottom, 9 at top). All adjacent cells are empty: UP is (8,6) with 'T' (likely empty), DOWN is (8,4) empty, LEFT is (7,5) empty, and RIGHT is (9,5) empty. There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake at (3,3), which is not adjacent, and all boundaries are walls, so I cannot move outside the grid.\n\nThe goal is to maximize points by eating apples while avoiding collisions. Apples are located at (2,4), (5,0), (0,0), (5,5), and (3,4). Since no apple is adjacent, I need to move in a direction that minimizes Manhattan distance to the nearest apple and avoids potential hazards.\n\nThe apples and their distances:\n- (2,4): Manhattan distance |8-2| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- (5,0): |8-5| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n- (0,0): |8-0| + |5-0| = 8 + 5 = 13\n- (5,5): |8-5| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (3,4): |8-3| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. Since I am at (8,5), moving LEFT (decreasing x) along y=5 will place me at (7,5), then (6,5), and so on toward (5,5). This direction is unblocked and necessary to reach the apple at (5,5). Moving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT would not be efficient as they increase or decrease y unnecessarily or move away from this target. For example, moving DOWN to (8,4) might bring me closer to farther apples like (5,0) or (0,0), but it doesn't help with (5,5). UP to (8,6) is a detour with no benefit. RIGHT to (9,5) leads away from all apples except distant ones.\n\nThe enemy snake at (3,3) is not a threat here, so I don't need to avoid left movement specifically. However, since other apples exist, I should keep an eye on the board as I grow and approach (5,5) to see if cornering the enemy or blocking its path becomes relevant for future turns. Also, as I grow from one segment, increasing my size will provide better defense, so I should not risk running into the enemy or walls prematurely.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:** After eating the apple at (5,5), I will analyze the board for blocked paths and areas near the enemy, using a \"flood fill\" approach to find shortest paths to unblocked apples while considering potential enemy movements. I'll prioritize apples that require shorter paths or are in safe zones. Until then, focus on reaching (5,5) and then (2,4) or (3,4) as alternatives if (5,5) is accessible.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT (decreasing x)",

Next, I'll move UP! \n\nResult: I decide to move UP.",

All adjacent cells are empty: UP is (8,6) with 'T' (likely empty), DOWN is (8,4) empty, LEFT is (7,5) empty, and RIGHT is (9,5) empty. There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake at (3,3), which is not adjacent, and all boundaries are walls, so I cannot move outside the grid.\n\nThe goal is to maximize points by eating apples while avoiding collisions. Apples are located at (2,4), (5,0), (0,0), (5,5), and (3,4). Since no apple is adjacent, I need to move in a direction that minimizes Manhattan distance to the nearest apple and avoids potential hazards.\n\nThe apples and their distances:\n- (2,4): Manhattan distance |8-2| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- (5,0): |8-5| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n- (0,0): |8-0| + |5-0| = 8 + 5 = 13\n- (5,5): |8-5| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (3,4): |8-3| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. Since I am at (8,5), moving LEFT (decreasing x) along y=5 will place me at (7,5), then (6,5), and so on toward (5,5). This direction is unblocked and necessary to reach the apple at (5,5). Moving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT would not be efficient as they increase or decrease y unnecessarily or move away from this target. For example, moving DOWN to (8,4) might bring me closer to farther apples like (5,0) or (0,0), but it doesn't help with (5,5). UP to (8,6) is a detour with no benefit. RIGHT to (9,5) leads away from all apples except distant ones.\n\nThe enemy snake at (3,3) is not a threat here, so I don't need to avoid left movement specifically. However, since other apples exist, I should keep an eye on the board as I grow and approach (5,5) to see if cornering the enemy or blocking its path becomes relevant for future turns. Also, as I grow from one segment, increasing my size will provide better defense, so I should not risk running into the enemy or walls prematurely.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:** After eating the apple at (5,5), I will analyze the board for blocked paths and areas near the enemy, using a \"flood fill\" approach to find shortest paths to unblocked apples while considering potential enemy movements. I'll prioritize apples that require shorter paths or are in safe zones. Until then, focus on reaching (5,5) and then (2,4) or (3,4) as alternatives if (5,5) is accessible.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT (decreasing x)",

I am located at (8,6), with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head and haven't eaten any apples yet. The only threat nearby is the enemy snake at (2,3), which is not adjacent to me.\n\nFrom my position, the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. I need to choose a direction that maximizes my chances of scoring points while avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I'll evaluate each direction:\n\n- UP: Decreasing x and increasing y? No, UP increases y (from (8,6) to (8,7)). The cell (8,7) is empty and safe, but there's no immediate apple or benefit, and it might not bring me closer to apples efficiently.\n- DOWN: Decreasing y to (8,5). There is an apple at (8,5), so moving there would allow me to eat it and grow, gaining a point. This is advantageous, and the cell is empty (not occupied by enemy or wall), so it's relatively safe with no immediate threats.\n- LEFT: Decreasing x to (7,6). The cell is empty, but there's no apple here, and it doesn't get me closer to any apple quickly. The enemy is at (2,3), so moving left might increase the risk of encountering it, but they are far away.\n- RIGHT: Increasing x to (9,6). Since the board is 10x10 (x from 0 to 9), (9,6) is valid and empty, but again, no apple is present or nearby, and it doesn't move me toward a goal.\n\nCurrently, the only adjacent apple is at (8,5), so moving DOWN to (8,5) allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake by one segment and gaining a point. This is a good first move to start building length, as I have no body segments yet.\n\nAfter this move, if I survive, my body will have one segment, and I'll need to plot a path to other apples while avoiding enemies. Since I don't have information on how the enemy will move, I'll assume it might stay or move, so I should avoid predictable behaviors.\n\nFor my strategy moving forward (after this next move), since I'm just starting with one body segment, I should prioritize moving towards apples that are closer or in unblocked paths. I might also avoid areas where the enemy could be, but for now, eating this apple is key to having more segments for defense. Additionally, I should remember that there are walls and other snakes (like the enemy) to avoid, so after growing, I need to think about wrapping or cutting off, but for the immediate next turn, the focus is on survival and scoring.\n\nNow, for my next move: DOWN seems the best choice to immediately gain a point and set up growth. I don't see any reason to delay or take a less beneficial path, so I'll go with that.\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN",

I am located at (8,6), with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head and haven't eaten any apples yet. The only threat nearby is the enemy snake at (2,3), which is not adjacent to me.\n\nFrom my position, the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. I need to choose a direction that maximizes my chances of scoring points while avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I'll evaluate each direction:\n\n- UP: Decreasing x and increasing y? No, UP increases y (from (8,6) to (8,7)). The cell (8,7) is empty and safe, but there's no immediate apple or benefit, and it might not bring me closer to apples efficiently.\n- DOWN: Decreasing y to (8,5). There is an apple at (8,5), so moving there would allow me to eat it and grow, gaining a point. This is advantageous, and the cell is empty (not occupied by enemy or wall), so it's relatively safe with no immediate threats.\n- LEFT: Decreasing x to (7,6). The cell is empty, but there's no apple here, and it doesn't get me closer to any apple quickly. The enemy is at (2,3), so moving left might increase the risk of encountering it, but they are far away.\n- RIGHT: Increasing x to (9,6). Since the board is 10x10 (x from 0 to 9), (9,6) is valid and empty, but again, no apple is present or nearby, and it doesn't move me toward a goal.\n\nCurrently, the only adjacent apple is at (8,5), so moving DOWN to (8,5) allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake by one segment and gaining a point. This is a good first move to start building length, as I have no body segments yet.\n\nAfter this move, if I survive, my body will have one segment, and I'll need to plot a path to other apples while avoiding enemies. Since I don't have information on how the enemy will move, I'll assume it might stay or move, so I should avoid predictable behaviors.\n\nFor my strategy moving forward (after this next move), since I'm just starting with one body segment, I should prioritize moving towards apples that are closer or in unblocked paths. I might also avoid areas where the enemy could be, but for now, eating this apple is key to having more segments for defense. Additionally, I should remember that there are walls and other snakes (like the enemy) to avoid, so after growing, I need to think about wrapping or cutting off, but for the immediate next turn, the focus is on survival and scoring.\n\nNow, for my next move: DOWN seems the best choice to immediately gain a point and set up growth. I don't see any reason to delay or take a less beneficial path, so I'll go with that.\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN",

If I move UP, I might be able to get it, but I'll still be in the same column, and I don't want to run into the wall above me. I have enough room to move UP without hitting the top wall at this position.\n\nNow, let me consider the (5, 0) apple. It's above and a bit to the right of my current position, so I'd need to move UP first and then RIGHT several times to reach it. That'll take some planning ahead, but it could be a good opportunity to grab two apples at once if the snake doesn't get in the way.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the (8, 5) apple. It's closer to my current position, and if I move RIGHT first and then UP, I might be able to reach it without getting too far away from the other apples.\n\nHowever, looking at my surroundings, I have enough space to safely move UP without hitting the enemy snake, so my top priority remains the apple at (2, 4), but this time moving UP will position me for a two-apple grab at (2, 4) and possibly the one just one column to the right of it, giving me three visible apple grabbed successfully.\n\nOkay, I think I've got a plan... Next, I'll move UP! \n\nResult: I decide to move UP.",

All adjacent cells are empty: UP is (8,6) with 'T' (likely empty), DOWN is (8,4) empty, LEFT is (7,5) empty, and RIGHT is (9,5) empty. There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake at (3,3), which is not adjacent, and all boundaries are walls, so I cannot move outside the grid.\n\nThe goal is to maximize points by eating apples while avoiding collisions. Apples are located at (2,4), (5,0), (0,0), (5,5), and (3,4). Since no apple is adjacent, I need to move in a direction that minimizes Manhattan distance to the nearest apple and avoids potential hazards.\n\nThe apples and their distances:\n- (2,4): Manhattan distance |8-2| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- (5,0): |8-5| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n- (0,0): |8-0| + |5-0| = 8 + 5 = 13\n- (5,5): |8-5| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (3,4): |8-3| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. Since I am at (8,5), moving LEFT (decreasing x) along y=5 will place me at (7,5), then (6,5), and so on toward (5,5). This direction is unblocked and necessary to reach the apple at (5,5). Moving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT would not be efficient as they increase or decrease y unnecessarily or move away from this target. For example, moving DOWN to (8,4) might bring me closer to farther apples like (5,0) or (0,0), but it doesn't help with (5,5). UP to (8,6) is a detour with no benefit. RIGHT to (9,5) leads away from all apples except distant ones.\n\nThe enemy snake at (3,3) is not a threat here, so I don't need to avoid left movement specifically. However, since other apples exist, I should keep an eye on the board as I grow and approach (5,5) to see if cornering the enemy or blocking its path becomes relevant for future turns. Also, as I grow from one segment, increasing my size will provide better defense, so I should not risk running into the enemy or walls prematurely.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:** After eating the apple at (5,5), I will analyze the board for blocked paths and areas near the enemy, using a \"flood fill\" approach to find shortest paths to unblocked apples while considering potential enemy movements. I'll prioritize apples that require shorter paths or are in safe zones. Until then, focus on reaching (5,5) and then (2,4) or (3,4) as alternatives if (5,5) is accessible.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT (decreasing x)",

My strategy will be to move forward, hoping to grab the (2, 4) apple and then reassess my next move to try to grab the nearby apple in the same column.\n\nUpon re-examining the board, I consider another option: the (5, 0) and (0, 8) apples are still within reach, but I think I might be able to cover more ground by targeting the (8, 5) apple first. That way, I'd have three visible apples in front of me, and I could plan my next few moves to try and grab the (2, 4) apple as well.\n\nI'll need to be cautious of snake #0, as they're positioned to possibly get in my way near the (7, 5) location.\n\nMy evaluated next move: \nRIGHT, wait for the result to see if I grab the nearby apple, then focus on grabbing the (2, 4) apple... take it one step at a time, no need to stress too much about the long-term plan here.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

The only threat nearby is the enemy snake at (2,3), which is not adjacent to me.\n\nFrom my position, the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. I need to choose a direction that maximizes my chances of scoring points while avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I'll evaluate each direction:\n\n- UP: Decreasing x and increasing y? No, UP increases y (from (8,6) to (8,7)). The cell (8,7) is empty and safe, but there's no immediate apple or benefit, and it might not bring me closer to apples efficiently.\n- DOWN: Decreasing y to (8,5). There is an apple at (8,5), so moving there would allow me to eat it and grow, gaining a point. This is advantageous, and the cell is empty (not occupied by enemy or wall), so it's relatively safe with no immediate threats.\n- LEFT: Decreasing x to (7,6). The cell is empty, but there's no apple here, and it doesn't get me closer to any apple quickly. The enemy is at (2,3), so moving left might increase the risk of encountering it, but they are far away.\n- RIGHT: Increasing x to (9,6). Since the board is 10x10 (x from 0 to 9), (9,6) is valid and empty, but again, no apple is present or nearby, and it doesn't move me toward a goal.\n\nCurrently, the only adjacent apple is at (8,5), so moving DOWN to (8,5) allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake by one segment and gaining a point. This is a good first move to start building length, as I have no body segments yet.\n\nAfter this move, if I survive, my body will have one segment, and I'll need to plot a path to other apples while avoiding enemies. Since I don't have information on how the enemy will move, I'll assume it might stay or move, so I should avoid predictable behaviors.\n\nFor my strategy moving forward (after this next move), since I'm just starting with one body segment, I should prioritize moving towards apples that are closer or in unblocked paths. I might also avoid areas where the enemy could be, but for now, eating this apple is key to having more segments for defense. Additionally, I should remember that there are walls and other snakes (like the enemy) to avoid, so after growing, I need to think about wrapping or cutting off, but for the immediate next turn, the focus is on survival and scoring.\n\nNow, for my next move: DOWN seems the best choice to immediately gain a point and set up growth. I don't see any reason to delay or take a less beneficial path, so I'll go with that.\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN",

If I move UP, I might be able to get it, but I'll still be in the same column, and I don't want to run into the wall above me. I have enough room to move UP without hitting the top wall at this position.\n\nNow, let me consider the (5, 0) apple. It's above and a bit to the right of my current position, so I'd need to move UP first and then RIGHT several times to reach it. That'll take some planning ahead, but it could be a good opportunity to grab two apples at once if the snake doesn't get in the way.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the (8, 5) apple. It's closer to my current position, and if I move RIGHT first and then UP, I might be able to reach it without getting too far away from the other apples.\n\nHowever, looking at my surroundings, I have enough space to safely move UP without hitting the enemy snake, so my top priority remains the apple at (2, 4), but this time moving UP will position me for a two-apple grab at (2, 4) and possibly the one just one column to the right of it, giving me three visible apple grabbed successfully.\n\nOkay, I think I've got a plan... Next, I'll move UP! \n\nResult: I decide to move UP.",

All adjacent cells are empty: UP is (8,6) with 'T' (likely empty), DOWN is (8,4) empty, LEFT is (7,5) empty, and RIGHT is (9,5) empty. There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake at (3,3), which is not adjacent, and all boundaries are walls, so I cannot move outside the grid.\n\nThe goal is to maximize points by eating apples while avoiding collisions. Apples are located at (2,4), (5,0), (0,0), (5,5), and (3,4). Since no apple is adjacent, I need to move in a direction that minimizes Manhattan distance to the nearest apple and avoids potential hazards.\n\nThe apples and their distances:\n- (2,4): Manhattan distance |8-2| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- (5,0): |8-5| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n- (0,0): |8-0| + |5-0| = 8 + 5 = 13\n- (5,5): |8-5| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (3,4): |8-3| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. Since I am at (8,5), moving LEFT (decreasing x) along y=5 will place me at (7,5), then (6,5), and so on toward (5,5). This direction is unblocked and necessary to reach the apple at (5,5). Moving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT would not be efficient as they increase or decrease y unnecessarily or move away from this target. For example, moving DOWN to (8,4) might bring me closer to farther apples like (5,0) or (0,0), but it doesn't help with (5,5). UP to (8,6) is a detour with no benefit. RIGHT to (9,5) leads away from all apples except distant ones.\n\nThe enemy snake at (3,3) is not a threat here, so I don't need to avoid left movement specifically. However, since other apples exist, I should keep an eye on the board as I grow and approach (5,5) to see if cornering the enemy or blocking its path becomes relevant for future turns. Also, as I grow from one segment, increasing my size will provide better defense, so I should not risk running into the enemy or walls prematurely.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:** After eating the apple at (5,5), I will analyze the board for blocked paths and areas near the enemy, using a \"flood fill\" approach to find shortest paths to unblocked apples while considering potential enemy movements. I'll prioritize apples that require shorter paths or are in safe zones. Until then, focus on reaching (5,5) and then (2,4) or (3,4) as alternatives if (5,5) is accessible.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT (decreasing x)",

My strategy will be to move forward, hoping to grab the (2, 4) apple and then reassess my next move to try to grab the nearby apple in the same column.\n\nUpon re-examining the board, I consider another option: the (5, 0) and (0, 8) apples are still within reach, but I think I might be able to cover more ground by targeting the (8, 5) apple first. That way, I'd have three visible apples in front of me, and I could plan my next few moves to try and grab the (2, 4) apple as well.\n\nI'll need to be cautious of snake #0, as they're positioned to possibly get in my way near the (7, 5) location.\n\nMy evaluated next move: \nRIGHT, wait for the result to see if I grab the nearby apple, then focus on grabbing the (2, 4) apple... take it one step at a time, no need to stress too much about the long-term plan here.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

The closest apple is at (5,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. From (6,7) to (5,5), I need to decrease both x and y coordinates. Decreasing x by 1 and y by 2, so I need to move left at least once (to (5,7)) and down at least twice (to reach y=5) to get there directly. \n\nNow, looking at the available moves:\n- Moving LEFT to (5,7) reduces the x-distance to (5,5) to 2, but keeps y the same. From there, I can move down to (5,6) and then to (5,5).\n- Moving DOWN to (6,6) reduces the y-distance to 2, but keeps x the same. From there, I can move left to (5,6) and then down to (5,5).\n- Moving UP to (6,8) increases y by 1, which increases the Manhattan distance to (5,5) from 3 to 5 (|6-5| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4), and isn't helpful for reaching the closest apple.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN reduce the overall distance to the apple, but moving LEFT directly decreases x towards the target, which might be more efficient since y isn't the issue yet. Also, the board shows that (5,7) is empty (from row y=7, x=5), so moving LEFT is safe and gets me closer without running into obstacles or opponents. There are no immediate threats or walls at (5,7), and the enemy snake is at (2,4), far away. \n\nI should also consider other apples, but (5,5) is clearly the priority. Approaching (5,5) requires going down-left in short steps. Even after moving LEFT to (5,7), I can continue with DOWN moves. Moving UP isn't beneficial and should be avoided. Therefore, for the next move, LEFT is the best choice to start reducing the x-coordinate.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n- After moving LEFT to (5,7), I will continue to (5,6) using DOWN, and then directly to (5,5) using DOWN again. (5,5) is empty and should be safe, as the enemy is not in the way.

I need to choose a direction that maximizes my chances of scoring points while avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I'll evaluate each direction:\n\n- UP: Decreasing x and increasing y? No, UP increases y (from (8,6) to (8,7)). The cell (8,7) is empty and safe, but there's no immediate apple or benefit, and it might not bring me closer to apples efficiently.\n- DOWN: Decreasing y to (8,5). There is an apple at (8,5), so moving there would allow me to eat it and grow, gaining a point. This is advantageous, and the cell is empty (not occupied by enemy or wall), so it's relatively safe with no immediate threats.\n- LEFT: Decreasing x to (7,6). The cell is empty, but there's no apple here, and it doesn't get me closer to any apple quickly. The enemy is at (2,3), so moving left might increase the risk of encountering it, but they are far away.\n- RIGHT: Increasing x to (9,6). Since the board is 10x10 (x from 0 to 9), (9,6) is valid and empty, but again, no apple is present or nearby, and it doesn't move me toward a goal.\n\nCurrently, the only adjacent apple is at (8,5), so moving DOWN to (8,5) allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake by one segment and gaining a point. This is a good first move to start building length, as I have no body segments yet.\n\nAfter this move, if I survive, my body will have one segment, and I'll need to plot a path to other apples while avoiding enemies. Since I don't have information on how the enemy will move, I'll assume it might stay or move, so I should avoid predictable behaviors.\n\nFor my strategy moving forward (after this next move), since I'm just starting with one body segment, I should prioritize moving towards apples that are closer or in unblocked paths. I might also avoid areas where the enemy could be, but for now, eating this apple is key to having more segments for defense. Additionally, I should remember that there are walls and other snakes (like the enemy) to avoid, so after growing, I need to think about wrapping or cutting off, but for the immediate next turn, the focus is on survival and scoring.\n\nNow, for my next move: DOWN seems the best choice to immediately gain a point and set up growth. I don't see any reason to delay or take a less beneficial path, so I'll go with that.\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN",

If I move UP, I might be able to get it, but I'll still be in the same column, and I don't want to run into the wall above me. I have enough room to move UP without hitting the top wall at this position.\n\nNow, let me consider the (5, 0) apple. It's above and a bit to the right of my current position, so I'd need to move UP first and then RIGHT several times to reach it. That'll take some planning ahead, but it could be a good opportunity to grab two apples at once if the snake doesn't get in the way.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the (8, 5) apple. It's closer to my current position, and if I move RIGHT first and then UP, I might be able to reach it without getting too far away from the other apples.\n\nHowever, looking at my surroundings, I have enough space to safely move UP without hitting the enemy snake, so my top priority remains the apple at (2, 4), but this time moving UP will position me for a two-apple grab at (2, 4) and possibly the one just one column to the right of it, giving me three visible apple grabbed successfully.\n\nOkay, I think I've got a plan... Next, I'll move UP! \n\nResult: I decide to move UP.",

All adjacent cells are empty: UP is (8,6) with 'T' (likely empty), DOWN is (8,4) empty, LEFT is (7,5) empty, and RIGHT is (9,5) empty. There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake at (3,3), which is not adjacent, and all boundaries are walls, so I cannot move outside the grid.\n\nThe goal is to maximize points by eating apples while avoiding collisions. Apples are located at (2,4), (5,0), (0,0), (5,5), and (3,4). Since no apple is adjacent, I need to move in a direction that minimizes Manhattan distance to the nearest apple and avoids potential hazards.\n\nThe apples and their distances:\n- (2,4): Manhattan distance |8-2| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- (5,0): |8-5| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n- (0,0): |8-0| + |5-0| = 8 + 5 = 13\n- (5,5): |8-5| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (3,4): |8-3| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. Since I am at (8,5), moving LEFT (decreasing x) along y=5 will place me at (7,5), then (6,5), and so on toward (5,5). This direction is unblocked and necessary to reach the apple at (5,5). Moving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT would not be efficient as they increase or decrease y unnecessarily or move away from this target. For example, moving DOWN to (8,4) might bring me closer to farther apples like (5,0) or (0,0), but it doesn't help with (5,5). UP to (8,6) is a detour with no benefit. RIGHT to (9,5) leads away from all apples except distant ones.\n\nThe enemy snake at (3,3) is not a threat here, so I don't need to avoid left movement specifically. However, since other apples exist, I should keep an eye on the board as I grow and approach (5,5) to see if cornering the enemy or blocking its path becomes relevant for future turns. Also, as I grow from one segment, increasing my size will provide better defense, so I should not risk running into the enemy or walls prematurely.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:** After eating the apple at (5,5), I will analyze the board for blocked paths and areas near the enemy, using a \"flood fill\" approach to find shortest paths to unblocked apples while considering potential enemy movements. I'll prioritize apples that require shorter paths or are in safe zones. Until then, focus on reaching (5,5) and then (2,4) or (3,4) as alternatives if (5,5) is accessible.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT (decreasing x)",

My strategy will be to move forward, hoping to grab the (2, 4) apple and then reassess my next move to try to grab the nearby apple in the same column.\n\nUpon re-examining the board, I consider another option: the (5, 0) and (0, 8) apples are still within reach, but I think I might be able to cover more ground by targeting the (8, 5) apple first. That way, I'd have three visible apples in front of me, and I could plan my next few moves to try and grab the (2, 4) apple as well.\n\nI'll need to be cautious of snake #0, as they're positioned to possibly get in my way near the (7, 5) location.\n\nMy evaluated next move: \nRIGHT, wait for the result to see if I grab the nearby apple, then focus on grabbing the (2, 4) apple... take it one step at a time, no need to stress too much about the long-term plan here.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

The closest apple is at (5,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. From (6,7) to (5,5), I need to decrease both x and y coordinates. Decreasing x by 1 and y by 2, so I need to move left at least once (to (5,7)) and down at least twice (to reach y=5) to get there directly. \n\nNow, looking at the available moves:\n- Moving LEFT to (5,7) reduces the x-distance to (5,5) to 2, but keeps y the same.

I am located at (8,6), with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head and haven't eaten any apples yet. The only threat nearby is the enemy snake at (2,3), which is not adjacent to me.\n\nFrom my position, the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. I need to choose a direction that maximizes my chances of scoring points while avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I'll evaluate each direction:\n\n- UP: Decreasing x and increasing y? No, UP increases y (from (8,6) to (8,7)). The cell (8,7) is empty and safe, but there's no immediate apple or benefit, and it might not bring me closer to apples efficiently.\n- DOWN: Decreasing y to (8,5). There is an apple at (8,5), so moving there would allow me to eat it and grow, gaining a point. This is advantageous, and the cell is empty (not occupied by enemy or wall), so it's relatively safe with no immediate threats.\n- LEFT: Decreasing x to (7,6). The cell is empty, but there's no apple here, and it doesn't get me closer to any apple quickly. The enemy is at (2,3), so moving left might increase the risk of encountering it, but they are far away.\n- RIGHT: Increasing x to (9,6). Since the board is 10x10 (x from 0 to 9), (9,6) is valid and empty, but again, no apple is present or nearby, and it doesn't move me toward a goal.\n\nCurrently, the only adjacent apple is at (8,5), so moving DOWN to (8,5) allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake by one segment and gaining a point. This is a good first move to start building length, as I have no body segments yet.\n\nAfter this move, if I survive, my body will have one segment, and I'll need to plot a path to other apples while avoiding enemies. Since I don't have information on how the enemy will move, I'll assume it might stay or move, so I should avoid predictable behaviors.\n\nFor my strategy moving forward (after this next move), since I'm just starting with one body segment, I should prioritize moving towards apples that are closer or in unblocked paths. I might also avoid areas where the enemy could be, but for now, eating this apple is key to having more segments for defense. Additionally, I should remember that there are walls and other snakes (like the enemy) to avoid, so after growing, I need to think about wrapping or cutting off, but for the immediate next turn, the focus is on survival and scoring.\n\nNow, for my next move: DOWN seems the best choice to immediately gain a point and set up growth. I don't see any reason to delay or take a less beneficial path, so I'll go with that.\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN",

If I move UP, I might be able to get it, but I'll still be in the same column, and I don't want to run into the wall above me. I have enough room to move UP without hitting the top wall at this position.\n\nNow, let me consider the (5, 0) apple. It's above and a bit to the right of my current position, so I'd need to move UP first and then RIGHT several times to reach it. That'll take some planning ahead, but it could be a good opportunity to grab two apples at once if the snake doesn't get in the way.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the (8, 5) apple. It's closer to my current position, and if I move RIGHT first and then UP, I might be able to reach it without getting too far away from the other apples.\n\nHowever, looking at my surroundings, I have enough space to safely move UP without hitting the enemy snake, so my top priority remains the apple at (2, 4), but this time moving UP will position me for a two-apple grab at (2, 4) and possibly the one just one column to the right of it, giving me three visible apple grabbed successfully.\n\nOkay, I think I've got a plan... Next, I'll move UP! \n\nResult: I decide to move UP.",

All adjacent cells are empty: UP is (8,6) with 'T' (likely empty), DOWN is (8,4) empty, LEFT is (7,5) empty, and RIGHT is (9,5) empty. There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake at (3,3), which is not adjacent, and all boundaries are walls, so I cannot move outside the grid.\n\nThe goal is to maximize points by eating apples while avoiding collisions. Apples are located at (2,4), (5,0), (0,0), (5,5), and (3,4). Since no apple is adjacent, I need to move in a direction that minimizes Manhattan distance to the nearest apple and avoids potential hazards.\n\nThe apples and their distances:\n- (2,4): Manhattan distance |8-2| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- (5,0): |8-5| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n- (0,0): |8-0| + |5-0| = 8 + 5 = 13\n- (5,5): |8-5| + |5-5| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (3,4): |8-3| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. Since I am at (8,5), moving LEFT (decreasing x) along y=5 will place me at (7,5), then (6,5), and so on toward (5,5). This direction is unblocked and necessary to reach the apple at (5,5). Moving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT would not be efficient as they increase or decrease y unnecessarily or move away from this target. For example, moving DOWN to (8,4) might bring me closer to farther apples like (5,0) or (0,0), but it doesn't help with (5,5). UP to (8,6) is a detour with no benefit. RIGHT to (9,5) leads away from all apples except distant ones.\n\nThe enemy snake at (3,3) is not a threat here, so I don't need to avoid left movement specifically. However, since other apples exist, I should keep an eye on the board as I grow and approach (5,5) to see if cornering the enemy or blocking its path becomes relevant for future turns. Also, as I grow from one segment, increasing my size will provide better defense, so I should not risk running into the enemy or walls prematurely.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:** After eating the apple at (5,5), I will analyze the board for blocked paths and areas near the enemy, using a \"flood fill\" approach to find shortest paths to unblocked apples while considering potential enemy movements. I'll prioritize apples that require shorter paths or are in safe zones. Until then, focus on reaching (5,5) and then (2,4) or (3,4) as alternatives if (5,5) is accessible.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT (decreasing x)",

My strategy will be to move forward, hoping to grab the (2, 4) apple and then reassess my next move to try to grab the nearby apple in the same column.\n\nUpon re-examining the board, I consider another option: the (5, 0) and (0, 8) apples are still within reach, but I think I might be able to cover more ground by targeting the (8, 5) apple first. That way, I'd have three visible apples in front of me, and I could plan my next few moves to try and grab the (2, 4) apple as well.\n\nI'll need to be cautious of snake #0, as they're positioned to possibly get in my way near the (7, 5) location.\n\nMy evaluated next move: \nRIGHT, wait for the result to see if I grab the nearby apple, then focus on grabbing the (2, 4) apple... take it one step at a time, no need to stress too much about the long-term plan here.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

The closest apple is at (5,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. From (6,7) to (5,5), I need to decrease both x and y coordinates. Decreasing x by 1 and y by 2, so I need to move left at least once (to (5,7)) and down at least twice (to reach y=5) to get there directly. \n\nNow, looking at the available moves:\n- Moving LEFT to (5,7) reduces the x-distance to (5,5) to 2, but keeps y the same. From there, I can move down to (5,6) and then to (5,5).\n- Moving DOWN to (6,6) reduces the y-distance to 2, but keeps x the same. From there, I can move left to (5,6) and then down to (5,5).\n- Moving UP to (6,8) increases y by 1, which increases the Manhattan distance to (5,5) from 3 to 5 (|6-5| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4), and isn't helpful for reaching the closest apple.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN reduce the overall distance to the apple, but moving LEFT directly decreases x towards the target, which might be more efficient since y isn't the issue yet. Also, the board shows that (5,7) is empty (from row y=7, x=5), so moving LEFT is safe and gets me closer without running into obstacles or opponents. There are no immediate threats or walls at (5,7), and the enemy snake is at (2,4), far away. \n\nI should also consider other apples, but (5,5) is clearly the priority. Approaching (5,5) requires going down-left in short steps. Even after moving LEFT to (5,7), I can continue with DOWN moves. Moving UP isn't beneficial and should be avoided. Therefore, for the next move, LEFT is the best choice to start reducing the x-coordinate.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n- After moving LEFT to (5,7), I will continue to (5,6) using DOWN, and then directly to (5,5) using DOWN again.

            "rationale": "I am primarily focused on reaching the closest apple to maximize my points. The apple at (5,5) is only 2 units away in Manhattan distance from my current head position (5,7), so it's a key priority. By moving directly down to (5,6), I decrease the y-coordinate and stay on the same column, getting closer to (5,5) in one turn. From there, I can immediately move down the next turn to (5,5) and potentially grow my snake.\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, DOWN is the most efficient path:\n- Accessing (5,6) requires 1 turn, then (5,5) requires another.\n- Left or Up would increase the distance to (5,5) or move away from direct progress, and the board shows those areas as empty with no immediate threats or better opportunities.\n- There are no nearby enemies or walls to avoid, so moving down should not risk collision.\n\nDown the road, I will continue to (5,5) to claim that apple, then reassess for new apples or potential threats from the enemy snakes. Specifically, after reaching (5,5), I can consider moving left or down if another apple appears, but I need to ensure I don't get boxed in.\n\n### Strategy reminder (for next turn)\n- After this move to (5,6), assume the new head is (5,6) and body includes (5,7) and (6,7).\n- Target (5,5): one step down from (5,6).\n- Monitor for obstacles or enemy movements, but currently low threat.\n- Eat the apple at (5,5) if available.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN",
