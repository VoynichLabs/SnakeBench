          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for my snake. First, I need to understand the current state of the game and the possible moves. \n\nSo, my snake is just the head at (7,6) with no body. The enemy snake (Snake 0) has a head at (5,6) and a body at (5,7). They both have apples on the board. My score is 0 apples, and they have 1. The board has apples at (5,3), (4,8), (2,3), (4,1), (3,3). \n\nThe main thing right now is to avoid dying. Since my snake is only the head, any move that goes into the enemy's body or off the board is dangerous. Let's look at each possible direction.\n\nThe last move was LEFT, which probably moved me to (6,6). Wait, the last move was LEFT, so my current position is (6,6)? Or maybe the last move was a LEFT, but after moving, my head is at (7,6)? Wait, the current head is (7,6). So the last move must have been to the left from (8,6) to (7,6). Or maybe the last move was a LEFT from some other position. Either way, the current head is (7,6). \n\nNow, possible directions:\n\nUP: (7,5)\nDOWN: (7,7)\nLEFT: (6,6)\nRIGHT: (8,6)\n\nI need to check each direction for immediate dangers.\n\nFirst, check if moving up to (7,5) is safe. The enemy's head is at (5,6). Their body is at (5,7). So (7,5) is not occupied by the enemy. Also, my own body is empty, so no issue. But need to check if any other snake's body is there. The board shows the snake 0's body is (5,7). So (7,5) is safe. Also, not off the board. So UP is possible.\n\nDOWN: (7,7). Check if that's safe. The enemy's body is at (5,7). So (7,7) is not in their body. The board has no other snakes. So DOWN is possible.\n\nLEFT: (6,6). Again, check if that's safe. The enemy's head is at (5,6), body at (5,7). So (6,6) is not occupied. So LEFT is possible.\n\nRIGHT: (8,6). Check if that's safe. The enemy's head is at (5,6), so no conflict. So RIGHT is possible.\n\nSo all four directions are initially possible. But I need to consider future moves and apples.\n\nThe next step is to think about which direction leads me closer to apples or keeps me safe. The apples are at (5,3), (4,8), (2,3), (4,1), (3,3). My current position is (7,6). \n\nLooking at the apples, (5,3) is to the left and down from me. (4,8) is up and left. (2,3) is even more left and down. (4,1) is left, up, then down? Maybe not. (3,3) is left and down.\n\nSo maybe moving left (to (6,6)) could get me closer to (5,3) or (3,3). Alternatively, moving up might get me towards (4,8) but that's a bit far. \n\nBut also, need to avoid collisions. For example, if I move left to (6,6), then next turn, maybe the enemy could move into that position? But since all snakes move simultaneously, I have to consider their possible moves. \n\nAlternatively, the enemy is at (5,6) and (5,7). If I move left to (6,6), then next turn, the enemy might move right, but they have a body. Let me think about their possible moves. Snake 0's head is at (5,6). If they move right, they go to (6,6), which is where I would be if I move left. So if I move left and they move right, we would collide. That's a problem. \n\nSo if I choose LEFT, then the enemy could move RIGHT, leading to a collision. So that's a risk. So maybe LEFT is dangerous because the enemy might move into my new position. \n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (7,5), the enemy's possible moves: if they move up, they go to (5,5), which is safe. If they move down, to (5,8), which is also safe. If they move left, to (4,6), which is safe. If they move right, to (6,6), which is not where I would be. So in that case, moving UP might be safer. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,7). The enemy's possible moves: if they move down to (5,7) to (5,8), which is safe. If they move up, to (5,5). So (7,7) is not in their path. \n\nMoving RIGHT to (8,6). The enemy's possible moves: if they move right, to (6,6), which is safe. So (8,6) is safe. \n\nSo the immediate danger is if I move left and the enemy moves right. So perhaps LEFT is a risky move. So maybe I should avoid LEFT. \n\nBut how can I know what the enemy will do? Since they are an opponent, they might try to collide. But maybe their movement is predictable? Or maybe they are trying to get apples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to move towards an apple. Let's see. The closest apple would be (5,3) or (3,3). But (5,3) is two steps left and three down. (3,3) is four steps left and three down. \n\nIf I move left to (6,6), then next turn, maybe I can move left again to (5,6), but that's where the enemy's head is. Wait, no, the enemy's head is at (5,6) now. If I move left to (6,6), then if the enemy moves left, they would go to (4,6), which is safe. But if they move right, they could come to (6,6). \n\nAlternatively, if I move down to (7,7), then maybe I can go towards (4,8) which is up and left. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,5) could be a way to get towards (4,8) or (5,3). \n\nBut I need to make sure that after my move, I have options. For example, if I move left, then next turn, I might be in a position where I can't move without colliding. \n\nAnother thing: the enemy has a body at (5,7). So if I move into (5,7), that's bad. But (5,7) is the enemy's body. \n\nSo, considering all that, perhaps the safest move is to go UP or DOWN. \n\nBut let's think about the apples. The (5,3) apple is in row 3, column 5. To get there, I need to move left and down. If I move left to (6,6), then next turn, maybe I can move left again to (5,6), but that's where the enemy's head is. So that's a collision. So that's bad. \n\nAlternatively, if I move down to (7,7), then maybe next turn I can move up towards (7,6) again, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,6) might not be directly towards any apple. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy has an apple at (5,3). If I can reach that, I can grow. But how? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to avoid the enemy's possible moves. Since the enemy is at (5,6), and I'm at (7,6), moving left would bring me closer to their head. If they move right, they could collide. So maybe moving left is risky. \n\nSo perhaps moving UP or DOWN is safer. \n\nBut which one? Let's think about the apples. The (4,8) apple is at row 8, column 4. From (7,6), moving up would take me towards row 5,4, etc. But (4,8) is at (4,8), which is up and left. So maybe moving up isn't directly helpful. \n\nAlternatively, moving down towards (7,7) might not be towards any apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best is to move in a direction that allows me to approach an apple while avoiding the enemy. \n\nWait, the enemy's head is at (5,6). If I move up to (7,5), then next turn, I could move left to (7,4), which is closer to (5,3). But I need to see if that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (6,6) might be a step towards (5,3). But again, the risk of collision. \n\nAnother thing: the enemy has a body at (5,7). So if I move into (5,7), that's bad. But none of the current moves go there. \n\nSo, considering all possibilities, the immediate danger is if I move left and the enemy moves right. So maybe I should avoid that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not likely to move right. But since they are an opponent, they might try to collide. \n\nSo, perhaps the safest move is to go UP or DOWN. \n\nBetween UP and DOWN, which is better? \n\nIf I move UP to (7,5), then next turn, I can move left to (7,4), which is closer to (5,3). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,7) might not be as helpful. \n\nBut maybe UP is better because (7,5) is closer to (5,3) than (7,7) is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (8,6) is safer. Because then I can move left or right again. \n\nBut the apples are more to the left. So maybe moving left is better, but with the risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best is to move LEFT but be cautious. \n\nBut given that the enemy could move right, which would collide with me if I move left, maybe I should avoid LEFT. \n\nSo the options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nAmong these, which one gets me closer to an apple? \n\n(7,5) is closer to (5,3) than (7,7). (8,6) is not. \n\nSo moving UP might be better. \n\nBut what about the enemy's possible moves? If I move UP, then next turn, the enemy could move in any direction. For example, if they move down to (5,7) to (5,8), which is safe. \n\nAlternatively, if they move right to (6,6), which is safe. \n\nSo moving UP seems safe. \n\nBut maybe there's another consideration. If I move UP, then next turn, I can move left or right. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,6) gives me more space, but not directly towards an apple. \n\nSo, perhaps the best move is UP. \n\nBut wait, let me check the board again. The board shows that at row 6, there's a '.' at (6,6), which is where I would go if I move left. But the enemy's head is at (5,6). So if I move left to (6,6), then next turn, the enemy could move right to (6,6), causing a collision. \n\nSo that's a risk. So moving left is dangerous. \n\nSo the safest moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which of these is best? \n\nIf I move UP to (7,5), then next turn, I can move left to (7,4), which is closer to (5,3). \n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,7), then next turn, I can move left to (7,6), but that's where I was before. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,6) might not be helpful. \n\nSo moving UP seems better. \n\nBut I need to check if (7,5) is safe. \n\nYes, because the enemy's head is at (5,6), body at (5,7). So (7,5) is not occupied. \n\nSo, moving UP is safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is also safe. \n\nBut which direction is better? \n\nThe apples are at (5,3), (4,8), (2,3), (4,1), (3,3). \n\nFrom (7,6), moving UP to (7,5) is closer to (5,3) (which is 2 rows down). \n\nFrom (7,7), moving UP would be towards (7,6), then (7,5), etc. \n\nBut maybe moving UP is more direct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT is safe but not helpful. \n\nSo I think moving UP is the best choice here. \n\nBut wait, another thing: the enemy's head is at (5,6). If I move UP to (7,5), then next turn, the enemy could move down to (5,7) to (5,8), which is safe. \n\nSo no collision. \n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves right to (6,6), which is safe. \n\nSo moving UP seems safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is UP. \n\nBut wait, the last move was LEFT. So if I move UP now, that's a change in direction. \n\nBut the strategy is to get towards apples while avoiding collisions. \n\nSo I think UP is the best choice here. \n\nBut let me double-check. \n\nIf I move UP to (7,5), then next turn, I can move left to (7,4), then left again to (7,3), then down to (5,3) if possible. \n\nBut that's a possible path. \n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT to (6,6), but that's risky. \n\nSo, yes, moving UP is better. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be UP.\nUP",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the current state of the game. The user's snake (ID 1) is at (7,8) with no body segments. The apples available are at (5,3), (4,8), (2,3), (4,1), and (3,3). The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (5,4) with a body segment at (5,5). The user's last move was UP, which makes sense because the head was at (7,8) and moving up would take them to (7,9), but wait, looking at the board state, the coordinates go from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So moving up increases the y-coordinate. The last move UP would take the snake from (7,8) to (7,9). But in the current position, the head is at (7,8), so moving up would go to (7,9), which is within the board since y ranges up to 9. Wait, but the board's top right is (9,9), so y=9 is valid. However, looking at the board's display:\n\nThe board shows row 8 (y=8) as \"8 . . . . A . . 1 . .\", where the '1' is at position 8 (y=8, x=8?), but the user's snake is at (7,8). Hmm, maybe the display is a bit confusing. But regardless, the main thing is the current positions.\n\nThe user's goal is to collect apples without dying. Since they have zero apples so far, they need to collect them to grow and gain points. The enemy has 1 apple, so they need to outpace them.\n\nFirst, the possible moves from (7,8) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each for safety.\n\nMoving UP: (7,8) -> (7,9). Is that a valid cell? Yes, since y=9 is allowed. Check if it's on another snake's body. The enemy's head is at (5,4), body (5,5). The user's own body is none. So (7,9) is safe. But after moving, the new head is (7,9), and the body would be the previous head (7,8). But since the snake was length 1, moving up would make the body (7,8). But the apple at (4,8) is in the same row. Maybe moving up isn't the best direction to reach apples. Let's see other apples.\n\nThe apples are at (5,3), (4,8), (2,3), (4,1), (3,3). The closest apple to the current position (7,8) is (4,8), which is 3 units to the left (same y). So moving left three times would reach it. Alternatively, (4,8) is at x=4, y=8. The user is at x=7, y=8. So moving left three times would get there. But need to avoid collisions.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT once would go to (6,8), then again to (5,8), then (4,8). But need to check if those cells are safe. Let's check each step.\n\nFirst, current head is (7,8). Possible moves:\n\nUP: (7,9). Safe? Yes. No apple there. But maybe not the best direction.\n\nDOWN: (7,7). Safe? Let's check. The enemy's head is at (5,4), body (5,5). The user's own body is none. So (7,7) is safe. But moving down might not be towards an apple.\n\nLEFT: (6,8). Safe? Check if that cell is occupied. The enemy's body is at (5,5), head (5,4). So (6,8) is empty. So safe.\n\nRIGHT: (8,8). Safe? Yes. But that's moving away from apples.\n\nSo the safe moves are all four directions. But we need to eliminate moves that would kill. Since the user's last move was UP, moving backwards (which would be DOWN now?) Wait, the last move was UP, so the body would be at (7,8). If the user moves DOWN now, that's the opposite direction. Wait, the rule says moving directly backwards into your own body counts as hitting. So if the last move was UP, then the body is at (7,8). So moving DOWN would take the head to (7,7), which is adjacent to the body. But since the body is only the previous position, moving into the cell directly behind (the body) would be a collision. Wait, the rule says: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n\nSo the last move was UP. The head was at (7,8) before the move. After moving UP, the new head is (7,9), and the body is [(7,8)]. So the current position is head at (7,9), body (7,8). If the next move is DOWN, that would take the head to (7,8), which is the body. So that's a collision. Therefore, moving DOWN is invalid because it's moving into the body. So in this case, the DOWN direction is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if the user's last move was UP, the body is now at (7,8). So moving DOWN would be into the body. Therefore, in the current state, the possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Because DOWN would hit the body.\n\nSo step 1: eliminate invalid moves. The user's last move was UP, so the body is at (7,8). Therefore, moving DOWN is invalid. So possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, among these, which is best?\n\nThe apples are at (4,8), (5,3), etc. The apple at (4,8) is directly left three steps. The apple at (5,3) is further down. Let's see.\n\nIf the user moves LEFT to (6,8), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8) to get the apple. But need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,9) doesn't get them closer to any apple. The apple at (4,8) is in the same y-level (y=8), so moving left is better.\n\nSo the best direction is LEFT towards (4,8). But need to check if the path is clear.\n\nBut also, the enemy snake is at (5,4) with body (5,5). Their movement is unknown, but we have to consider possible collisions. Since all snakes move simultaneously, the enemy might move in a way that could collide with the user's snake.\n\nFor example, if the user moves LEFT to (6,8), and the enemy moves in some direction. But since the enemy's current position is (5,4), their possible moves could be anything. However, the user needs to avoid being hit by the enemy's head.\n\nBut since the enemy's head is at (5,4), and the user is at (7,8), the distance is quite large. So immediate collision is unlikely. However, if the enemy moves towards the user's path, that could be a problem.\n\nBut given that the user's main goal now is to collect apples, especially (4,8) which is nearby, moving LEFT towards that apple seems optimal.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving LEFT to (6,8), the next move could be LEFT again to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8). But each step needs to be safe. Are there any obstacles in those cells?\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 8 (y=8) has the apple at (4,8) (since the display shows \"8 . . . . A . . 1 . .\", so x=4 is the A). So (4,8) is an apple. The cells (6,8), (5,8) are empty. So moving LEFT three times would reach the apple. However, the enemy's snake is at (5,4) with body (5,5). If the enemy moves upwards, they could be moving towards (5,5) or other directions. But since the user's path is along y=8, which is far from the enemy's y=4, immediate collision is not a concern. However, in future turns, the enemy might approach.\n\nAnother thing: the user's snake is length 1. So after eating an apple, they will grow. So getting the apple at (4,8) would make them length 2. That's good for future moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT once to (6,8) is safe. Then next turn, move LEFT again to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8). But each step must be safe. Let's check each step.\n\nFirst move LEFT to (6,8): safe. Then next move LEFT to (5,8): is that cell occupied? The enemy's head is at (5,4), body (5,5). So (5,8) is empty. So yes, safe. Then next move to (4,8) which is an apple. So that's a good plan.\n\nBut what if the enemy moves into (5,8) in the next turn? Then when the user's head is at (5,8), and the enemy's head is there, that would be a collision. But since all snakes move simultaneously, if the enemy moves into (5,8) in the same turn that the user is moving to (5,8), both would die. So that's a risk.\n\nBut the enemy's current position is (5,4). To reach (5,8) in one move, they would need to move up 4 times, which is impossible in one turn. So the enemy can't reach (5,8) in one move. Therefore, moving towards (4,8) is safe in the short term.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to get closer to the apple at (4,8). Alternatively, maybe moving UP is not useful, but LEFT is better.\n\nAnother apple is at (3,3), but that's further away. The apple at (4,8) is the closest. So prioritizing that makes sense.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Among these, LEFT is the best direction to reach an apple. Therefore, the answer should be LEFT.\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let's start by understanding the current state.\n\nMy snake is at (7,8) with no body segments. The apples are at (5,3), (4,8), (2,3), (4,1), and (3,3). The enemy snake is at (5,4) with a body segment at (5,5). The last move I made was UP, so the body is now at (7,8). That means moving DOWN would be into my own body, which is invalid. So the possible moves now are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I need to check which moves are safe. The UP direction would take me to (7,9). The board's boundary is from 0 to 9, so (7,9) is valid. There's no apple there, but maybe that's a step towards something else. However, the closest apple is (4,8), which is three steps to the left. The LEFT direction (6,8) is safe since no snakes are there. Similarly, RIGHT to (8,8) is safe but moves away from apples.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,4) with body at (5,5). They might move in any direction, but since they're far away, immediate collision is unlikely. However, I should consider their possible movements. For example, if they move upwards, they might get closer to (5,8) or (5,9), but that's speculative.\n\nThe apple at (4,8) is directly left of my current position. Moving LEFT three times would get me there, but each step needs to be safe. The first move LEFT to (6,8) is safe. Then next turn, LEFT to (5,8), then to (4,8). But I need to make sure that in each step, the path is clear. Since the enemy is at (5,4), moving to (5,8) would be possible only if the enemy moves there, but they can't reach that in one turn. So the path seems clear.\n\nAnother consideration is the apples. Collecting (4,8) would give me 1 apple, increasing my score. The other apples are further away. Prioritizing the closest apple makes sense for growth.\n\nLooking at the possible moves:\n\n- UP to (7,9): Safe but not towards an apple.\n- LEFT to (6,8): Safe, moves towards (4,8).\n- RIGHT to (8,8): Safe but away from apples.\n\nSo LEFT is the best choice here. It's safe and moves me closer to an apple. The enemy's position doesn't interfere with this path in the immediate future. Also, moving LEFT doesn't restrict future moves as much as going UP might. Going UP might leave me in a position where I can't easily get to other apples, especially if I need to move down later. Meanwhile, moving LEFT allows me to continue moving left towards (4,8) and possibly other apples if needed.\n\nAnother check: if I move LEFT to (6,8), the next move could be LEFT again to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8). Each step is safe as those cells are empty. So this seems feasible.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is LEFT.\nLEFT",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for my snake here. First, I need to understand the current state. My snake's head is at (2,7), and the body is at (2,8). So the head is one position below the body. The last move was DOWN, which moved me from (2,7) to (2,8)? Wait, no. Wait, the previous move was DOWN, so if the head was at (2,7) after the last move, moving DOWN would take me to (2,8)? Wait, but in the board state, row 7 is marked with a '1' at (2,7). Hmm, maybe the rows are numbered from bottom to top? Wait, the problem says coordinates are from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) top right. So the board is displayed such that row 0 is the bottom, and row 9 is the top. So in the board state, the 0th row is the bottom line. The head is at (2,7), which is in row 7 (so 7th row from the bottom, which is the top part of the board). The body is at (2,8), which is row 8. So the snake's body is above the head? Wait, that's interesting. Because the head is at (2,7), and the body is at (2,8). So the snake is vertical, with the head at (2,7) and the next segment at (2,8). Wait, but that would mean that the snake is moving upwards? Because the head is below the body. Wait, maybe the last move was DOWN. Let me check the last move info. The last move was DOWN. So the previous head was at (2,6), and moving down to (2,7)? But according to the current state, the head is at (2,7) and body at (2,8). That would imply that after moving DOWN, the head is at (2,7), and the body is at (2,8). Wait, that's possible. Wait, when you move, the head moves in the direction, and the body follows. So the last move was DOWN, so the head moved down from (2,6) to (2,7), and the body moved from (2,7) to (2,8). But in the current state, the head is at (2,7), and the body is at (2,8). So the next move will be from (2,7) to some direction. Wait, but the current head is (2,7), and the body is (2,8). So the snake is vertical, with the head at (2,7) and the body at (2,8). So if I move up, the head would go to (2,6), and the body would follow. But if I move down, the head would go to (2,8), but that's already occupied by the body. That would be a collision. So moving down is not allowed. Because the next cell in that direction would be (2,8), which is the body. Wait, but according to the rules, moving into your own body's current position (excluding the tail?) or including? The rule says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So moving down would put the head into (2,8), which is the current body. So that's a collision. So moving down is invalid. So the possible directions are up, left, right. Because down is blocked by the body. Wait, but the last move was DOWN. Let me check the last move again. The last move was DOWN. So the head moved from (2,6) to (2,7), and the body moved to (2,7) from previous positions. Wait, maybe the body is now at (2,7) and the tail? No, the body is [(2,8)], so the snake has two segments: head at (2,7) and body at (2,8). So the snake is vertical, with the head at (2,7) and the body at (2,8). So the direction the snake is facing is down, because the last move was down. But when moving, the next direction can't be down again because that would move the head into (2,8), which is the body. So the possible directions are up, left, right. Let me check each direction:\n\nUp: (2,7) -> (2,6). Is that a valid move? Let's see. The new head would be (2,6). The body would follow, so the new body would be (2,7). So the snake would be (2,6) head, then (2,7). The body is (2,7), which is the previous head. So that's allowed. But we need to check if (2,6) is occupied by any other snake's body or head. Also, check if moving there would cause any collision. The other snake, snake 0, has a head at (1,4) and body [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]. So (2,3) is part of snake 0's body. (2,6) is not in snake 0's body. So moving up to (2,6) is possible. But what about other snakes? There's only snake 0 as enemy. So that's safe.\n\nLeft: (2,7) -> (1,7). Check if that's valid. The new head is (1,7). The body would be (2,7). Check if (1,7) is off the board? No, x ranges from 0-9. So (1,7) is valid. Also, check if (1,7) is occupied by any snake. Snake 0's body is at (1,3), (2,3), etc. So (1,7) is free. So left is possible.\n\nRight: (2,7) -> (3,7). Similarly, check if (3,7) is safe. The other snake's body is at (4,3), (5,3), etc. So (3,7) is clear. So right is possible.\n\nSo possible moves are up, left, right. Down is invalid because it would hit the body.\n\nNow, among these options, we need to choose the best one. The objectives are to eat apples and stay safe. Let's look at the apples. The apples are at (4,1), (9,4), (0,0), (9,2), (2,0). My snake has already collected 1 apple. The other snake has 5. The closest apple to my current position (2,7) would be (2,0), which is two units down. But moving down is not allowed. Alternatively, (4,1) is at x=4, y=1. That's a bit further. (0,0) is even further. (9,4) is on the right side. (9,2) is also on the right. So maybe moving right could get me closer to (9,4) or (9,2). But moving right to (3,7) would take me to x=3, which is closer to 9. But how far is that? From (2,7) to (9,4), the Manhattan distance is (9-2)+(7-4) =7+3=10. If I move right, I get closer. But also, maybe there's a path. Alternatively, moving up might allow me to go down towards (2,0), but I can't move down now. Wait, if I move up to (2,6), then next turn I could move down again. But the problem is that movement is simultaneous. So I need to plan a path towards apples while avoiding collisions.\n\nAlternatively, the closest apple is (2,0), but to reach that from (2,7), I need to move down 7 times. But since I can't move down now, maybe that's not feasible. The other apples are (9,4) and (9,2) on the right side. So moving right could be a way to approach those. Let's see. If I move right to (3,7), then next turn I can continue moving right, but I need to see if that's possible without hitting the other snake. The other snake, snake 0, is moving. Their head is at (1,4), and their body is along (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So their body is along y=3 and x from 1 to 5. So if I move right, I might not collide with them unless their movement brings them into my path.\n\nBut since all snakes move at the same time, I need to consider where the other snakes will be after their move. However, the problem says that the enemy snakes' moves are not given here. So perhaps I need to assume that I don't know their next moves, but I can plan based on their current positions. But the enemy's next move is unknown. So perhaps I should focus on my own survival and moving towards apples.\n\nSo, possible moves: up, left, right. Let's evaluate each.\n\nOption 1: Up to (2,6). This moves me up one step. The apple at (2,0) is below, but I can't go down. However, moving up might allow me to eventually move down later if possible. Alternatively, this could be a safe move. But maybe moving towards the right is better for reaching apples.\n\nOption 2: Left to (1,7). This moves me left. The apple at (2,0) is to the right and down. Not sure if that's helpful. But (1,7) is in column 1, which is near snake 0's head (1,4). But snake 0's body is at (1,3), so moving left to (1,7) is safe for now. But if snake 0 moves up, they might collide. But since we don't know their next move, it's hard to predict. However, the key is to avoid moving into their body. If snake 0's next move is unknown, but their current body is at (1,3), (2,3), etc. So (1,7) is safe for now.\n\nOption 3: Right to (3,7). This moves me towards the right side, where apples (9,4) and (9,2) are. The distance is larger, but perhaps moving towards that direction could lead to apple collection. The other snake's body is at (3,3), so (3,7) is safe. So moving right is possible.\n\nNow, the next consideration is which move allows for more safe options in the next turn. For example, moving up might keep more options open. If I move up to (2,6), next turn I can move up again, or left, right, or down (but down would take me back to (2,7), which would be my previous head position. Wait, but the body would be (2,7) and (2,8). So if I move down from (2,6) to (2,7), that's my previous head position, which is now part of the body. So that would be a collision. So moving down after moving up would not be possible. So moving up might limit options. Alternatively, moving right could allow me to continue moving right, but again, need to check if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (1,7). Then next turn, possible moves could be left, up, right, or down. Down would take me back to (2,7), which is my previous head position. But since the body would be (1,7), (2,7), so moving down to (2,7) would hit the body. So that's not allowed. So from (1,7), possible moves are left, up, right. But right is (2,7), which is my previous head. So if I move right from (1,7), the new head would be (2,7), which is part of the body (since the body after moving left would be [(1,7)] and the previous head was (2,7)? Wait, no. Let me think. When I move left from (2,7) to (1,7), the new body would be [(2,7)], right? Because each move appends the new head and shifts the body. Wait, the snake's body is a list where the first element is the head, then each subsequent is the next part. So when you move, the new head is in the direction, and the body follows. So after moving left to (1,7), the body would be [(2,7)]. So the next move from (1,7) would have the head at (1,7), and body at (2,7). So if I move right (to (2,7)), that's the body, which is invalid. So moving right from (1,7) is invalid. So from (1,7), possible moves are left, up, down. Down would take me to (1,8), which is not part of the body. Wait, the body is (2,7). So (1,8) is safe. So from (1,7), moving down to (1,8) would be possible. So that's a possible direction. But how does that help in getting apples?\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (3,7) would allow me to proceed towards the right side. The apples are at (9,4) and (9,2). So moving right could be a step towards those. But how far is that? From (3,7) to (9,4) is 6 in x and 3 in y. That's a distance of 9. But each move can only go one step. So it's a long way. However, perhaps the other snake is moving in a way that could block that path. But since we don't know their next moves, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother factor is the other snake's position. Snake 0's head is at (1,4), and their body is along (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So they are in the lower part of the board, moving possibly upwards or in some direction. If they are moving up, their head would be at (1,5) next turn. But if they are moving in some other direction, their body could change. However, since their next move is unknown, we have to assume that they might move in any direction. So if I move right, there's a chance that snake 0's next move could collide with me. For example, if snake 0's head moves to (3,3) (if they move right from (1,4) to (2,4), but their body is at (1,3), (2,3), etc. Wait, snake 0's current head is (1,4), body is [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]. So their body is along x from 1 to 5, y=3. So their head is at (1,4), which is above their body. So their next move could be up, down, left, right. If they move up, their head would go to (1,5). If they move right, to (2,4). If they move left, to (0,4). If they move down, to (1,3), which is part of their body. So moving down would be invalid for them. So their possible moves are up, right, left. So if they move right to (2,4), then their body would be (1,4), (2,3), etc. So if I move right to (3,7), then snake 0's head could be at (2,4), which is not near me. So maybe no collision. But if snake 0 moves in some direction that brings their head into my path, that's a problem.\n\nAnother consideration is that if I move right, I might be moving towards the right side where apples are, but also away from the other snake. Alternatively, moving up might keep me in a safer position. But the apple at (2,0) is directly below me. But I can't move down now. If I move up, I can't reach that apple. However, if I move left or right, maybe I can find a path to other apples.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the other snake has 5 apples, and I have 1. So there's a competition. If I can reach an apple before they do, that's good. But since they have more apples, maybe they are in a better position. But I need to focus on my own survival and growth.\n\nLooking at the apples again: (4,1), (9,4), (0,0), (9,2), (2,0). The (2,0) apple is at (2,0), which is two rows below my current head (y=7). To reach that, I need to move down 7 times. But since I can't move down now (because that would hit my body), maybe that's not feasible. The other apples are on the right side. So moving right could be a way to get to (9,4) or (9,2). Let's see. From (2,7), moving right to (3,7), then (4,7), etc. Each step right. But the apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. So if I can get to x=9, y=4, that's a big distance. Alternatively, maybe there's a path. But with the other snake's presence, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up is safer. If I move up to (2,6), then next turn I can move up again, or left, right. But if I keep moving up, I might reach a point where I can then move down towards (2,0) if possible. But again, the path would require moving down multiple times, which might not be possible if the snake's body is in the way.\n\nWait, but after moving up to (2,6), the next move could be down to (2,7), but that's my previous head position. However, after moving up, the body would be [(2,7)], so moving down from (2,6) to (2,7) would be into the body. So that's invalid. So after moving up, the only options are left, right, or up again. So moving up might trap me in a vertical line, but if I can eventually turn left or right when needed.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (1,7) could allow me to move left again, but that's towards x=0, which is near the apple at (0,0). But that's a long way. Alternatively, moving left could take me closer to snake 0's head at (1,4). But snake 0's body is at (1,3), so (1,7) is safe. If snake 0 moves up, their head could be at (1,5), which is still not near me. So maybe moving left is possible.\n\nAnother factor is the potential for future moves. The strategy is to have multiple safe options. For example, moving right might allow me to have more options in the next turn, but if I'm moving towards a wall or a snake's body, that's bad. Alternatively, moving left might offer a different path.\n\nWait, the other snake's body is along (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So if I move right to (3,7), then in the next turn, if the other snake moves down, their head could be at (1,3) again, but that's not near me. Alternatively, if they move right, their head would be at (2,4), which is still not near me. So maybe moving right is safe.\n\nBut the key is to choose a move that allows me to eat an apple in the future. The closest apple is (2,0), but I can't reach it now. The next closest might be (9,2) or (9,4), but those are far. Alternatively, (4,1) is at (4,1), which is to the right and down. If I can move right, then maybe I can approach that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to go right towards the right side apples. So moving right to (3,7). That seems like a step towards (9,4) or (9,2). But I need to make sure that this move doesn't lead to a dead end. For example, if I keep moving right, I might reach x=9, but need to avoid walls. The board is 10x10, so x=9 is valid. So moving right is possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be safer. Let's think about the other snake. If they move in a way that could block my path. For example, if they move up, their head could be at (1,5), but that's not near me. If they move right, their head is at (2,4). Still not near me. So moving right seems safe.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if I move right, I can potentially reach apples on the right side. The apple at (9,4) is on the right. So moving right is a step towards that. However, the distance is large, but it's a start.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up is better to avoid the other snake. But I don't see how. The other snake is at y=3 and 4, while I'm at y=7. So there's a distance. Unless they can move up and collide, but it's not likely in the next few moves.\n\nSo between up, left, right. Which is best?\n\nThe problem says to prefer moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves. So moving right might allow me to continue moving right, but if there's a wall or snake, that's bad. But in this case, moving right to (3,7) is safe. Then next turn, I can move right again to (4,7), etc. But if I keep moving right, I could reach x=9. But the apples are at (9,4) and (9,2). So if I can reach x=9, I can try to go down to those apples. But that would require moving down from (9,7) to (9,4) or (9,2). However, that's 3 or 5 steps. But the problem is that during those moves, the other snake or my own body could block.\n\nAlternatively, moving right could be a good direction. But I need to check if there's any other danger. For example, if the other snake moves into my path. But since I can't predict their moves, it's hard to say. But the safest assumption is that they might move in any direction.\n\nAnother point: the last move was DOWN. So the snake's direction was down. If I move in the opposite direction (up), that's a reversal. But the rule says that moving directly backwards into your own body counts as a collision. But in this case, moving up from (2,7) would not be a backward move. The previous move was down, so moving up is a 180-degree turn. But according to the rules, moving directly backwards into your own body (the cell directly behind) is a collision. So if I move up, the new head is (2,6), and the body becomes (2,7). So that's allowed. Because the cell (2,6) is not part of the body. So moving up is allowed.\n\nSo, the possible moves are up, left, right. Now, which of these gives the best chance to collect apples and stay safe.\n\nIf I move right to (3,7), then next turn I can move right again. But if I keep moving right, I can reach x=9. But the apple at (9,4) is at y=4. So from (3,7) to (9,4) is 6 steps right and 3 steps down. So I would need to move right 6 times and down 3 times. But during that time, I have to avoid collisions. However, each move is a choice, and the other snake's movements are unknown.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) could allow me to then move left or right. But if I move up, I might be moving away from the apples on the right. But maybe there's another apple up there. Looking at the apples, (0,0) is at the bottom left, (2,0) is also down. So maybe the right side apples are the best bet.\n\nAnother consideration: the other snake's head is at (1,4). If I move right, I'm moving away from that area. If I move left, I'm moving towards x=1, which is where snake 0's head is. But snake 0's body is at (1,3), so (1,7) is safe. But if snake 0 moves up, their head could be at (1,5), which is still not near me. So moving left is possible but might not be the best for apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving up could be a way to avoid the other snake. But I don't see a direct path to apples from there.\n\nSo, considering all this, moving right seems like a direction that could lead towards the apples on the right side. However, I need to make sure that this move doesn't lead to a dead end. For example, if after moving right, I can't move further right because of the other snake. But since I don't know their next move, it's hard to predict. But the current move is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left is better to avoid the other snake. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: check which apples are reachable. The apple at (2,0) is two steps down from current head. But I can't move down now. So that's not possible. The other apples are (9,4), (9,2), (4,1), (0,0). (4,1) is at x=4, y=1. To reach that, I need to move right 2 steps and down 6 steps. But again, that's a long path. (9,4) is 7 steps right and 3 steps down. (9,2) is 7 right and 5 down. So moving right could be a way to approach those.\n\nSo, moving right to (3,7) is a step towards (9,4) or (9,2). Let's say I choose right. Then next turn, I can move right again. But I need to make sure that in the next turn, the move is safe. For example, if I move right again to (4,7), then check if that's safe. The other snake's body is at (4,3), so (4,7) is safe. So that's possible. So moving right seems a good option.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (1,7) could be a way to avoid the other snake, but I don't see an immediate apple there. However, maybe there's a path to (0,0) from there. But that's a long way.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if I move right, I might have more options in the next turn. For example, if I move right to (3,7), then next turn I can move right, up, left, or down. But down would be (3,8), which is not part of the body. So that's possible. So moving right allows for more flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (2,6) could allow me to move left or right next. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother factor is that the other snake has 5 apples, and I have 1. So if I can collect more apples quickly, that's better. But the apples on the right are the ones I can reach by moving right.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving right is the best choice here. It's a safe move, allows me to approach the right-side apples, and keeps options open. Let me check again if moving right is safe. The current head is (2,7). Moving right to (3,7). Is (3,7) occupied by any snake? Snake 0's body is at (3,3), so no. So (3,7) is safe. So yes, moving right is allowed.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the next move for my snake in this multi-apple Snake game. The goal is to survive and collect as many apples as possible, especially since the enemy snake has 5 apples compared to my 1. Let me start by understanding the current state.\n\nFirst, my snake's current position: head is at (5,7), and the body is [(4,7)]. So the head is at x=5, y=7 (since y increases upwards, that's the second row from the top, maybe?), and the body is directly below the head at (4,7). Wait, coordinates go from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So (5,7) is in row 7 (which is near the top since 9 is top), column 5. The body is at (4,7), so same row as the head but left by one unit.\n\nThe apples available are at (4,1), (9,4), (0,0), (9,2), (2,0). The board state shows:\n\n- The top row (9) has an apple at (9,9) maybe? Wait, no. Let me parse the board state:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9 (top row) is . . . . . . . . . . (no symbol, but maybe the apple at (9,4) is in row 4? Wait, the board is printed from top (9) down to bottom (0), right? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . T 1 . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . T T T T T 0 . . A\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . A\n1 . . . . A . . . . .\n0 A . A . . . . . . .\n\nWait, each line is a row. So line 9 is the top row (y=9?), but according to the problem statement, (9,9) is top right. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the coordinate system says (0,0) is bottom left, (9,9) is top right. So the rows go from y=0 (bottom) to y=9 (top). So in the board display, the first line is y=9 (top), then y=8, down to y=0.\n\nSo the apples are at (4,1) which is x=4, y=1 (second row from the bottom), (9,4) in the fifth row from the bottom (y=4?), (0,0) is bottom left, (9,2) is x=9, y=2 (third row from bottom), (2,0) is x=2, y=0 (bottom row). So the apples are scattered around.\n\nMy snake is at (5,7), which is in the third row from the top (since y=7, and top is y=9). The body is at (4,7), so moving left from the head.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,4) head, body along x positions 5,4,3,2,1 at y=4. So they are in a horizontal line to the left of me, at the same y=4 level.\n\nLast move was RIGHT. So before that, the head was at (4,7)? Wait no: starting at (5,7) after moving RIGHT. Wait, if last move was RIGHT, then previous head position must have been (4,7), and moving right to (5,7). Because moving right increases x. So last move was right, so the head was at (4,7) before, and now is at (5,7). The body was at (3,7) before? Because when you move right, the body shifts. Wait, the snake's body is [ (4,7) ] now. So when the last move was RIGHT, the head moved from (4,7) to (5,7), and the body part followed. But since the body is only one segment, it's just that.\n\nNow, in the next move, I need to choose a direction. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety.\n\nFirst, check for immediate death situations.\n\nMoving UP: new head would be (5,8). Is that within bounds? Yes. Is it on another snake's body or apple? Not sure yet. Also, check if moving up would lead into my own body. Since my current body is (4,7). So moving up to (5,8), next body segments would be the previous head (5,7), so (5,7) and (4,7). So moving up would not be into my own body. So that's safe.\n\nMoving DOWN: new head (5,6). Safe as well, unless there's another snake there. Let's check the enemy snake. Enemy's head is at (6,4), body is (5,4), (4,4), etc. So (5,6) is not part of their body. So moving down is safe.\n\nMoving LEFT: new head (4,7). Wait, current body is (4,7), so moving left would put the head into my own body. Because last move was right (from (4,7) to (5,7)), so moving left would reverse into the previous position. Since the rule says moving directly backwards into your own body (the cell directly behind the head) counts as a hit. Wait, the current head is at (5,7). The body is at (4,7). So moving left would take the head to (4,7), which is the current body. But according to the rules, moving into any part of your body except maybe the tail? Wait, no. The rule says: If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die. Except that moving directly backwards into your own body (the cell directly behind the head) also kills you. Wait, the exact wording: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die. Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n\nWait, so moving into any body part (including own) is bad. Except that if you move directly backward (into the cell that was your body before the last move) that's also a no-go. Wait, perhaps the \"directly backwards\" is a separate check, but maybe all body parts are considered. For example, if the head moves into any part of its own body, it's a death. So moving left here would take the head to (4,7), which is the current body. So that's a collision with self. So move left would kill.\n\nSimilarly, moving right: new head (6,7). Then check if that cell is in any snake's body or another snake's head. My snake's next body would be the previous head (5,7), which is safe. But enemy's position: their head is at (6,4), body extends left to (5,4), etc. So moving to (6,7) is safe as long as no enemy is there. So right is possible?\n\nWait, but after moving right, my head would be at (6,7), and body would be (5,7) then. So next body segments would be (5,7), then previous body segments. So moving right would not collide with my own body. So moving right is safe?\n\nWait, but the last move was right, so moving right again would continue in that direction. Let's check each direction.\n\nLet me list each possible move:\n\n1) UP: new head (5,8). Check if that's in bounds (yes), not colliding with any snake's body. Enemy's body is in y=4, so (5,8) is safe. Not an apple. But maybe moving towards apples. The apples are mostly in lower rows. So moving up may not get closer to apples. But needs to be safe.\n\n2) DOWN: new head (5,6). Safe? Yes. Check if moving down is good.\n\n3) LEFT: new head (4,7). That's my current body part (4,7) is the body now. So moving left would make the head into the body. But according to the rule, moving into any part of your own body is death. So this direction is invalid, will kill me. So eliminate LEFT.\n\n4) RIGHT: new head (6,7). Check if that's safe. My body will be (5,7) in next turn, but (6,7) is empty. Enemy's positions: their head is (6,4), body is (5,4), etc. So (6,7) is in row 7, column 6. No enemy there. So moving right is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Because LEFT is deadly.\n\nNow, among these three directions, need to choose the best one based on future moves and apple collection.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\nMy current apples: 1. The enemy has 5. My goal is to collect more apples.\n\nThe apples available are:\n\n(4,1) - bottom part.\n\n(9,4) - top right area.\n\n(0,0) - bottom left.\n\n(9,2) - near top right.\n\n(2,0) - bottom row.\n\nSo which direction gets me closer to these apples.\n\nMy current position is (5,7). So moving up would take me to (5,8), which is higher up. The apple at (9,4) is x=9, y=4. So to reach that, I need to go down, right, and maybe up/down again. But moving up might not help me reach apples quickly.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is a possible target. Let's see. From (5,7), moving down towards lower y. Let's see:\n\nIf I move down, each step reduces y by 1. So moving down to (5,6), then (5,5), etc. Maybe I can reach the apple at (9,4) by moving right and down? Alternatively, moving right could help, but first check if moving right is possible.\n\nSo possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRATIONALE:\n\nMoving right would continue towards x=9. The apple at (9,4) is at x=9, y=4. So moving right from (5,7) would take me to (6,7), which is closer to x=9. However, moving right would require me to go through (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7). But the apple at (9,4) is lower. So perhaps moving right helps in getting to the x=9 column, but the y=4 is needed. Alternatively, moving down to get closer to the lower apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down allows me to reach (5,4), but that's in enemy territory. Wait, the enemy's head is at (6,4), body at (5,4), (4,4), etc. So (5,4) is part of the enemy's body. If I move down to (5,6), then (5,5), then (5,4) would be into the enemy's body. That would kill me. So moving down might not be a direct path.\n\nSo perhaps moving right is a safer direction to grow towards the (9,4) apple. Let's check:\n\nIf I move right to (6,7), the next possible positions could be moving right again, but that's possible. Or maybe moving down once to get closer to (9,4). Since (9,4) is at y=4, which is 3 steps down from y=7 (assuming each step is 1 unit). So from (5,7), moving down would require going down 3 steps, but each step, I have to avoid enemy snakes.\n\nWait, the enemy's body is along y=4, x from 1-6. So if my snake moves down to (5,6), that's safe. Then next move could be (5,5), then (5,4). But (5,4) is part of the enemy's body. So that's dangerous. Because when I move to (5,4), the enemy's body is there. So the head would hit the enemy's body, thus dying.\n\nSo moving down might be risky. Alternatively, moving right to get closer to (9,4) but avoiding the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (9,4) is a good target. But how to reach it safely.\n\nAnother apple is (9,2). That's even higher. So perhaps the best target is (9,4) because it's at y=4, which is lower than my current position.\n\nBut to reach (9,4) from (5,7), if I move right and then down. Let's see:\n\nCurrent position (5,7). Move right to (6,7), then next move could be down to (6,6), etc. But each move needs to be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving right once to (6,7), then next turn right again to (7,7), then down steps. But how to avoid collisions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving right is the best direction now because it's safe and takes me closer to the (9,4) apple. But maybe not. Let me check other possibilities.\n\nUP: moving to (5,8). But that's going away from all apples. The apples are lower down, so moving up might not be useful. Unless there's a way to get to an apple from the top, but according to the board, there's an 'A' in (9,9) perhaps? Wait, looking at the board line 9 (top row) is all dots. The apple at (9,2) is in row 2 (from bottom), so in the board line 2 (since y=2 is third line from top). So row 9 (top) has no apples. So moving up would take me further from all apples. So UP is probably bad for apple collection. So maybe eliminate UP as a direction.\n\nSo then between DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nMoving DOWN: (5,6). Safe? Yes. Then possible next moves. But moving down may lead me towards the enemy's body if I proceed further. However, the enemy is at (6,4), etc. So (5,6) is safe.\n\nBut how to reach apples from there. Let's see:\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is in enemy's body. So moving down from (5,6) to (5,5), then (5,4) would be deadly. So that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, moving right from (5,6) towards x=9. Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (5,7) to (6,7), then down steps towards (9,4). That seems possible.\n\nComparing the two directions: RIGHT vs DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, I can start moving towards the x=9 column, which has apples. Then in subsequent moves, I can go down towards (9,4). But need to make sure that the path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now doesn't contribute much to the x-coordinate, but maybe allows me to get down towards the apples in lower rows.\n\nBut given that the enemy snake is at (6,4), my current position is (5,7). If I move down, I can reach (5,6), then maybe next turn move right to (6,6), but then maybe down towards y=4. But need to avoid enemy bodies.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now gives me a position with more x-coordinate, which is closer to (9,4). So maybe that's better.\n\nAnother thing to consider: movement that allows future moves. For example, after moving right to (6,7), the next body segment would be (5,7). So the possible next moves would need to avoid (5,7). But as long as not moving left, it's okay.\n\nSo between the two options, RIGHT seems better because it's progressing towards the (9,4) apple, which is a key target. Also, moving right doesn't block myself in a corner. The UP direction is probably not useful because apples are in lower rows.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nWait, but let me check if moving right would allow me to reach (9,4) without colliding. Let's see:\n\nCurrent head at (5,7). Move right to (6,7). Then next moves could be right to (7,7), (8,7), (9,7). Then down to (9,6), (9,5), (9,4). That would reach the (9,4) apple. But during this path, need to ensure that none of these positions are occupied by other snakes. The enemy's head is at (6,4), body at (5,4), (4,4), etc. So (9,4) is in row 4, x=9. So when reaching (9,4), that's the apple. So the path from (5,7) right to (9,7), then down to (9,4) would require moving through (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4). Are any of these positions occupied by other snakes? The enemy snake's positions are at (6,4) and their body. So (9,4) is safe. So that path is possible.\n\nTherefore, moving right now allows progress towards that apple. The alternative is moving down, which might not be as effective.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's start by analyzing the current situation. My snake is at (8,7) with a body part at (7,7). The head is at the top right corner of the board. The apples remaining are at (4,1), (0,0), (9,2), (2,0), (9,7). Wait, (9,7) is just to the right of my head. But since I'm at (8,7), moving right would take me to (9,7), which has an apple. But wait, the apple at (9,7) is listed in the apples at section. So if I move right, I can collect that apple. However, I need to check if moving right is a safe move.\n\nFirst, check the possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's go through each direction:\n\nUP: From (8,7) moving up would take me to (8,6). I need to check if that's a safe position. The board's state shows that in row 7 (y=7?), looking at the board display:\n\nLooking at the board as provided:\n\nThe rows are from y=0 (bottom) to y=9 (top). The current position of my snake is:\n\nHead: (8,7), body: (7,7). Wait, the body is only one segment. So the snake is two cells long. The head is at (8,7), body segment at (7,7). So moving up from (8,7) would go to (8,6). What's in (8,6)? Looking at the board representation:\n\nIn row 7 (y=7?), no. Let me parse the board state.\n\nThe board is displayed as:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . . (y=9)\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . T 1 A (y=7)\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . T T T T T T 0 (y=4)\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . A (y=2)\n1 . . . . A . . . . . (y=1)\n0 A . A . . . . . . . (y=0)\n\nSo row y=7 is the line: 7 . . . . . . . T 1 A\n\nIn this row, x positions are from 0 to 9. The snake's head is at (8,7), which is the 9th position (since x starts at 0). Let's check each direction.\n\nMoving UP from (8,7) would be to (8,6). The row for y=6 is:\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo (8,6) is empty. That seems safe. But we need to check if any other snakes' bodies or heads are in that position. The enemy snake #0 is at (9,4) with body parts from (8,4) down to (3,4). So in row 4, x from 3 to 9 are body parts. So (8,6) is clear. So moving up is possible. However, is there any collision risk? Also, after moving, the next turn's body would be wherever the head was. So if I move up, the next position is (8,6), and the body would be (8,7) (since the body follows the previous head position). But in the current state, the body is at (7,7). Wait, no: the body is [(7,7)], so the head is (8,7), body is (7,7). So if I move up, the new head is (8,6), and the new body becomes the previous head (8,7). So the new body is (8,7). So in the next step, the body would be (8,7). So moving up is safe now. But I need to check if any enemy snake's body or head is in (8,6). The enemy snake #0's body is along y=4, so no. So moving up is safe in the immediate move.\n\nBut moving up would not get me closer to any apples. The apples are at (4,1), (0,0), (9,2), (2,0), (9,7). The apple at (9,7) is right there. So moving right would get me to (9,7) and collect an apple. But is moving right safe?\n\nCheck RIGHT direction: (8,7) to (9,7). The apple is there. But need to check if (9,7) is safe. The board's row y=7 has an T, 1, A at x=8,9? Wait, the line for y=7 is: 7 . . . . . . . T 1 A. So x=8 is 'T', x=9 is '1', x=10? Wait, no, the board is 10x10, so x ranges from 0-9. So the line for y=7 is:\n\nAt x=8: T, x=9: 1, and then A? Wait, maybe the last character is A. Wait, the line is written as \"7 . . . . . . . T 1 A\". So x=0 to x=9. So positions on y=7:\n\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\n...\nx=7: .\nx=8: T\nx=9: 1\n\nWait, but the line ends with A? Maybe there's a typo in the way it's displayed. Alternatively, perhaps the 'A' is part of the display indicating that (9,2) is an apple. Maybe the board display is a bit unclear. The apples listed are (4,1), (0,0), (9,2), (2,0), (9,7). So (9,7) is an apple. So moving right to (9,7) would collect that apple. But is (9,7) safe?\n\nCheck if (9,7) is occupied by any other snake. The enemy snake #0's head is at (9,4), body parts are from (8,4) down to (3,4). So their body is along y=4. So (9,7) is empty. So moving right to (9,7) is possible. However, when moving right, the head moves to (9,7), which is an apple. So that's a good opportunity. But I need to check if moving right would cause any collision. The enemy snake's head is at (9,4). So (9,7) is three rows above that. So no collision with enemy heads. The enemy snake's body is at y=4. So moving right to (9,7) is safe. However, after moving right, my new body would be (8,7). So in the next turn, if I move right again, but that's not the case now. So moving right seems safe and gives an apple. That's a good move.\n\nBut wait, what about the enemy snake's movement? The enemy snake #0 is at (9,4) with a body. They might move in some direction. But since we can't predict their move, we have to consider that they might move into positions that could affect us. However, in the current turn, the enemy's head is at (9,4). If they move up, they could go to (9,5), but that's not near us. Alternatively, if they move up, up, up, but that's not relevant for this turn.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that after moving right, my snake's head is at (9,7), which is an apple. Collecting that apple would grow me by 1 segment. But since I have only 1 apple so far, and the enemy has 6, maybe growing is beneficial. However, the goal is to collect as many apples as possible before others. But since the enemy is ahead, perhaps we need to collect apples quickly.\n\nBut there's a risk in moving right. If the enemy snake moves in a way that their body or head comes into our path. But in this turn, the enemy's head is at (9,4), and their body is along y=4. So (9,7) is three rows above. So unless they move up, but even if they do, in this turn, their movement is simultaneous. So during this turn, the enemy's head is at (9,4), and their body parts are at (8,4), etc. So moving right to (9,7) is safe in this turn.\n\nAnother consideration: moving right would take me to (9,7), which is an apple. So that's +1 apple. But after that, my body would be (8,7). Then, in the next turn, if I move left, I can go back to 8,7, but that's my previous head position. But that's allowed as long as I don't move back into the body. Wait, the rule says: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" So if I move right to (9,7), then in the next turn, if I move left, I would be going back to (8,7), which is now my body. That would be a collision. So moving right now would set up a potential trap for next turn. But maybe that's not a problem if we can avoid moving left next turn.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,6) would allow more flexibility. Let's see. If I move up, then next turn, possible directions could be up, down, left, right. For example, if I move up to (8,6), then next turn, I can go up to (8,5), or right to (9,6), etc. But (9,7) is an apple, so maybe moving right now is better.\n\nBut also, the apple at (9,7) is the only one in that area. So getting that apple would be good. However, the enemy snake is at (9,4), which is four rows below. So if they move up, they could reach (9,5), but that's still not conflicting with us. However, if they move up four times, they could reach (9,7), but that's in future turns. But in this turn, moving right to (9,7) is safe.\n\nSo the options are:\n\nOption 1: Move right to (9,7) to collect the apple. This is a safe move. Then, in the next turn, we need to be careful not to move left (back into our body). But for now, this seems like a good move to gain an apple.\n\nOption 2: Move up to (8,6). This doesn't get an apple but keeps options open. However, the apple at (9,7) is right there. So not taking it now might mean it's available for others? Wait, but in this game, are apples static? The problem says \"move onto an apple\", implying that apples are on the board and once collected, they disappear. But the apples list shows (9,7) as an apple. So if I don't collect it now, maybe another snake could take it. But the enemy snakes are #0 and possibly others? Wait, the user only lists enemy snake #0. So maybe there are other enemies, but in the given data, only #0 is listed. So if I don't take (9,7) now, maybe no one else can. But perhaps (9,7) is safe to take.\n\nAnother thing: moving right would make my head at (9,7), which is the edge of the board. So in the next turn, if I try to move right again, I would go off the board and die. So we need to plan for that. But for now, moving right here is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down from (8,7) would take me to (8,8). Let's check that. The board's y=8 row is: 8 . . . . . . . . . . So (8,8) is empty. That's safe. But again, not getting an apple.\n\nSo the possible safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT would take me to (7,7), which is my current body. So moving left would be into my own body, which is a collision. So LEFT is invalid. So eliminate LEFT.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, among these, which is best?\n\nMoving right gives an apple. That's a clear benefit. But we need to ensure that after moving right, we can still make safe moves. For example, after moving right, our body is at (8,7). So next turn, if we move left, we would be going back to (8,7), which is our body. So that's a collision. So we need to avoid that. But in the next turn, we can plan to move in other directions.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,6) would allow more flexibility. But then we miss the apple.\n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake #0 has 6 apples, and we have 1. They are closer to some apples. For example, the apple at (9,2) is near their head at (9,4). If they move down, they could reach (9,3), then (9,2) next turn. But again, this is speculative.\n\nBut our priority is to collect apples. Since (9,7) is an apple right next to us, and moving right is safe, that seems like the best move. But wait, let me double-check the safety.\n\nWhen moving right to (9,7):\n\n- Is (9,7) within the board? Yes, since x=9 is valid.\n\n- Is (9,7) part of any snake's body or head?\n\n- Our own body is at (7,7), so no.\n\n- Enemy snake #0's head is at (9,4), body is along y=4. So (9,7) is not part of their body. So moving right is safe.\n\nTherefore, moving right is a valid move that collects an apple. That's a good move. However, after this move, our snake's body will be at (8,7). So next turn, if we want to move left, we can't, because that would be into our body. So we need to plan ahead. But for now, this move seems optimal.\n\nAlternatively, if we move up to (8,6), we don't get the apple, but we can then move right in the next turn to (9,6), but that's not an apple. Or maybe move right again to (9,6), but that's not an apple. So maybe moving right now is better.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,7) is the only one in that area. So taking it now is advantageous. The enemy snake is at (9,4), so they can't reach (9,7) in one move. So even if they move up, they can't get there in this turn. So taking the apple now is safe and beneficial.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

Wait, but the last move was RIGHT. Wait, the last move was RIGHT, and now the head is at (9,7). So if I move RIGHT again, I would go to (10,7), which is outside the 10x10 board (since x ranges from 0-9). So that's invalid. So RIGHT is not possible now. Wait, but the last move was RIGHT, which moved the head from (8,7) to (9,7). Now, the current head is at (9,7). So possible moves now are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Because moving RIGHT would take it to (10,7), which is invalid.\n\nWait, the last move was RIGHT. So the previous position was (8,7) to (9,7). Now, the head is at (9,7). So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Because moving Right would go to (10,7), which is invalid. So the possible move options now are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nBut wait, the apples include (9,7). Wait, the apples listed include (9,7)? Let me check. The apples are listed as (4,1), (0,0), (9,2), (2,0), (9,7). Yes, (9,7) is an apple. But my head is currently at (9,7). So moving into that cell would collect the apple. But since I'm already there, maybe the apple was collected when I arrived there. Wait, but the apples list shows (9,7) as an apple. So perhaps the apple is still there. But when I moved RIGHT to get there, I must have collected it. Because normally, when you move onto an apple, you collect it and it disappears. So maybe (9,7) is no longer an apple. But according to the current apples list, it's still there. Hmm, maybe the apples are static until collected. So maybe I didn't collect it yet. Wait, but the last move was RIGHT. So when I moved from (8,7) to (9,7), that should have collected the apple at (9,7), right? But the apples list still shows (9,7) as an apple. That's confusing. Maybe the apples list is updated after the move. Or maybe there's a mistake in the data. Alternatively, perhaps the apple at (9,7) was not collected yet. Wait, the user's last move was RIGHT, which moved the head to (9,7). If that cell had an apple, then after moving there, the apple should be collected. But in the current apples list, (9,7) is still present. That suggests that maybe the apple wasn't collected, which is odd. Maybe there's an error in the data, but I have to work with what's given. So perhaps (9,7) is still an apple. That would mean that moving RIGHT again would take me out of the board, which is invalid. So maybe the apple at (9,7) was collected when I moved there last time. But the list still shows it. That's conflicting. Maybe the apples list is not updated correctly. But I have to proceed with the given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the (9,7) apple is still there. If that's the case, moving RIGHT is invalid (out of bounds), so I can't collect it. So maybe the apple was not collected. But that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the apple was collected when I moved there, and the list is outdated. But I have to go by the data provided. So according to the apples list, (9,7) is still an apple. So I need to check if moving to (9,7) again would collect it. But since I'm already at (9,7), moving RIGHT is invalid. So the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nSo now, possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLet me check each direction.\n\nUP: from (9,7) to (9,6). Check if (9,6) is safe. The board's row y=6 is all dots except maybe some. From the board display:\n\nRow 6 (y=6) is: 6 . . . . . . . . . . So (9,6) is empty. Also, check if any other snake is there. The enemy snake #0's head is at (9,4), body parts along y=4. So (9,6) is safe. So UP is possible.\n\nDOWN: from (9,7) to (9,8). The row y=8 is all dots. So (9,8) is empty. Safe.\n\nLEFT: from (9,7) to (8,7). But (8,7) is my previous body part. Wait, the body is [(8,7), (7,7)]. So moving LEFT to (8,7) would be moving into my own body. Because the current body is at (8,7) and (7,7). So moving LEFT would take me to (8,7), which is part of my body. That's a collision. So LEFT is invalid. Because moving into your own body (including the cell directly behind the head) is a death. So LEFT is not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves are UP or DOWN.\n\nNow, between UP and DOWN. Which is better?\n\nUP: (9,6). DOWN: (9,8).\n\nLooking at the apples, the remaining ones are (4,1), (0,0), (9,2), (2,0). The apple at (9,2) is two rows below the head. So if I move DOWN to (9,8), that's two steps away. But maybe not. Alternatively, moving UP to (9,6) might not be near any apples. The apple at (9,2) is at y=2. So (9,6) is higher up. So perhaps neither direction is directly towards an apple. But maybe there's a path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP allows me to go left or down in the next turn. Let's think about future moves.\n\nIf I move UP to (9,6), next turn I could move LEFT to (8,6), or DOWN to (9,7) again (but that's where I was before), or UP to (9,5), etc. But (9,7) was an apple, but if it's still there, maybe I can move back. But moving back would be into my previous position. Wait, after moving UP to (9,6), the body would be (9,7). So moving DOWN next turn would go to (9,7), which is my body. That's invalid. So need to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,8) would have the body at (9,7). So next turn, moving UP would go back to (9,7), which is body. So that's also a problem.\n\nHmm. So both directions have potential issues in the next move. But maybe moving UP is better because it's towards lower y (downwards in coordinates? Wait, the coordinate system is such that y increases upwards. Wait, the problem says: coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So y increases upwards. So moving UP increases y, DOWN decreases y.\n\nSo (9,7) is higher up. Moving UP would go to (9,8), which is even higher. Wait, no. Wait, if y=0 is bottom, then y=9 is top. So moving UP from (9,7) would be to (9,8), and moving DOWN to (9,6). So the direction of movement: UP is towards higher y, DOWN towards lower y.\n\nSo the apple at (9,2) is at y=2. So moving DOWN towards lower y could get closer to that apple. But (9,2) is two steps below (9,4). Wait, the enemy's head is at (9,4). So if I move DOWN to (9,6), then next turn, moving DOWN again to (9,5), then (9,4). But that's where the enemy's head is. But the enemy's head is at (9,4), so moving into that would cause a collision. So that's dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (9,7) to (9,6), then next turn, maybe move LEFT or RIGHT. But RIGHT is out of bounds. LEFT would be (8,6). But then, maybe towards other apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,8) gives more space to move LEFT or RIGHT (but RIGHT is invalid). LEFT to (8,8), which is empty. Then maybe towards other apples.\n\nBut the key is to collect apples. The nearest apple is (9,2), which is 5 steps away vertically. So perhaps moving DOWN towards it. But need to avoid the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is better to avoid the enemy. The enemy's head is at (9,4), and body along y=4. So if I move DOWN, I might approach their path. For example, if I go to (9,6), then (9,5), (9,4) would be next. But the enemy's head is at (9,4), so if I move there, I die. So need to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,8) keeps me away from the enemy. Then, perhaps I can move LEFT or DOWN in future turns.\n\nBut how to reach the apples? The apples are at (4,1), (0,0), (9,2), (2,0). (9,2) is the closest in this area. So maybe trying to reach (9,2).\n\nFrom (9,7), moving DOWN to (9,6), then (9,5), (9,4) is the enemy's head. So that's bad. So maybe need to go around. Alternatively, move LEFT from (9,7) is invalid. So perhaps moving UP to (9,8) gives more options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (9,6) and then LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), etc. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (9,8) and then LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN towards (8,7) (but that's my previous body), but need to avoid that.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think about the immediate safety and future options.\n\nMoving UP to (9,8) is safe. Then, next turn, possible moves are UP (to 9,9), LEFT (to 8,8), or DOWN (to 9,7, which is body). So avoiding DOWN. So moving LEFT to (8,8) would be possible. Then, from there, maybe move LEFT again or DOWN.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,6) and then LEFT to (8,6), then maybe DOWN to (8,5), etc. But that's a path towards the center or other apples.\n\nBut the apple at (9,2) is in the same column (x=9), y=2. So to reach there, I need to go from (9,7) down to (9,2). But the enemy is at (9,4). So if I can get to (9,3) without the enemy being there. But the enemy's head is at (9,4), and their body is along y=4. So if I move to (9,3), that's safe, but the enemy might move into that position. However, in this turn, the enemy's movement is unknown. But we have to consider that they might move into our path.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (9,6), then next turn, maybe move LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), etc. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,8) gives more freedom. For example, from (9,8), moving LEFT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7) (but that's my previous body, which is now (8,7) as the body after moving UP. Wait, after moving UP to (9,8), the body would be (9,7). So next turn, moving LEFT to (8,8) would be safe. Then, from (8,8), possible moves could be LEFT, DOWN, or UP.\n\nBut how does this help in collecting apples? The apples are spread out. The (9,2) apple is in the same column but lower. Maybe it's better to go for that apple, but avoiding the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is better to get closer to (9,2), but need to avoid the enemy. Let's see: from (9,7), moving DOWN to (9,6), then (9,5), then (9,4) is enemy's head. So that's bad. So maybe need to move LEFT at some point. But if I go to (9,6), then LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), etc. That way, avoiding the enemy's path.\n\nBut this requires multiple moves. However, in the current turn, the choice is between UP and DOWN.\n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake is moving. They might move in a way that blocks our path. But since we can't predict their move, we have to assume the worst case. However, in this turn, their head is at (9,4), so if I move DOWN towards (9,4), they might move up or down. But it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (9,8) keeps me away from the enemy. So that might be safer.\n\nAnother thing: the snake's body is at (8,7) and (7,7). If I move UP to (9,8), the new body will be (9,7). So next turn, if I move LEFT to (8,8), that's safe. Then, from (8,8), I can move LEFT again or DOWN.\n\nBut the apple at (9,2) is still there. Maybe it's better to focus on that. But getting there requires moving down, but avoiding the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (9,6) and then LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), etc. But that's a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is better for immediate safety. Since moving DOWN could lead to the enemy's area.\n\nSo considering all factors, moving UP to (9,8) is safer and allows more options. Then, in future turns, I can navigate towards other apples. The apple at (9,2) is still there, but I need to reach it without colliding with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is better to collect (9,2) if possible. But how?\n\nWait, (9,2) is at y=2. From (9,7), that's 5 steps down. But the enemy is at (9,4). So if I move DOWN to (9,6), then (9,5), then (9,4) would be the enemy's head. So that's a collision. So I can't go that way. So maybe need to move LEFT at some point. For example, from (9,6) move LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), etc. But that's a detour.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is better to avoid the enemy and then find a path to the apple.\n\nSo between UP and DOWN, moving UP seems safer. Because moving DOWN could lead towards the enemy's path, which is risky. So I'll go with UP.\nUP",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's tackle this turn. First, I need to figure out the best move for my snake (ID 1) to maximize my chances. Let's start by understanding the current state.\n\nMy snake's head is at (2,9), and the body is (3,9), (4,9), (5,9). So the snake is moving along the y=9 line, from x=2 to x=5. The apples are at (0,0), (2,0), (1,7), (0,1), (9,7). Wait, (9,7) is one of the apples. My current position is at (2,9), so possible directions to move. But I need to check which moves are safe.\n\nFirst, check each direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to eliminate invalid ones.\n\nUP: From (2,9), moving up would take me to (2,10), which is out of bounds (y=10 is beyond 9). So UP is invalid. Dead if I choose that.\n\nDOWN: From (2,9) down to (2,8). Is (2,8) part of any snake's body? Let me check. My body is at 3,9;4,9;5,9. The enemy snake (0) has head at (2,1), body from (3,1) up to (9,2). So (2,8) is not part of any snake's body. Also, is that a valid move? Yes, because moving down from (2,9) to (2,8) is inside the board. So DOWN is possible.\n\nLEFT: From (2,9) to (1,9). Is (1,9) part of any snake's body? My own body is at 3,9; etc. The enemy snake's body is all at y=1 and some at y=2. So (1,9) is empty. So LEFT is possible.\n\nRIGHT: From (2,9) to (3,9). But (3,9) is my own body segment. That's invalid because moving into own body. So RIGHT is out.\n\nSo possible moves are DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, check if moving into own body in the next step would cause a collision. Wait, the rules say that moving into your own body (including backwards) is fatal. So moving LEFT to (1,9) is safe for this turn. Then, next turn, if I move again, need to avoid hitting that new head position. But for now, just check the immediate move.\n\nSo possible options are DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, among these, need to choose which one is better in terms of growing (eating apples) and avoiding future issues.\n\nLooking at the apples: the closest ones might be (2,0) or (1,7). Wait, my current position is (2,9). Let's see distances.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), then in the next move, maybe I can go LEFT again to (0,9), but that's not an apple. Or maybe move DOWN or UP. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) might get me closer to some apples.\n\nLooking at the apples: (2,0) is at the bottom, (1,7) is lower than (0,1). The apple at (9,7) is on the right side. The rest are at (0,0) and (0,1). So maybe moving LEFT or DOWN could help reach some apples.\n\nFor example, moving LEFT to (1,9) and then perhaps continuing left towards (0,9), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8), then maybe left or down more to reach (2,0) apple. But (2,0) is at the bottom. Alternatively, (1,7) is in the middle. Let's see coordinates.\n\nFrom (2,9) to (1,7): that's two steps down and one left. If I move LEFT first to (1,9), then DOWN twice would get to (1,7). But that's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) and then LEFT twice to (0,8), but that's not an apple. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,7) is on the right side. But my current position is on the left. Maybe not the best direction. The apple at (0,1) is near the bottom left. Maybe moving LEFT could help in that direction.\n\nBut considering that the enemy snake is at (2,1) with a long body. If I move LEFT to (1,9), would that interfere with the enemy? The enemy's head is at (2,1), body up to (9,1) and (9,2). So moving to (1,9) is far away. No immediate collision.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving, need to ensure that next move options are available. For example, if I move LEFT to (1,9), then next turn, possible moves could be LEFT (to 0,9), DOWN (1,8), or RIGHT (back to 2,9 which is now empty? Wait, after moving LEFT, my new head is at 1,9. My body would be [ (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9) ]? Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, the head moves, and each body part follows. So after moving LEFT, the new head is (1,9), and the body becomes [ (2,9), (3,9), (4,9) ] because the tail is dropped? Wait, no. Wait, when you move, the head moves, and each body segment follows. So if I have a snake with head at (2,9), body (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), then moving LEFT would make the new head (1,9), and the body becomes [ (2,9), (3,9), (4,9) ] because the tail (5,9) is dropped. Wait, but in the current state, the body is listed as [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9)], so the snake has 4 segments: head at (2,9), then 3,4,5. So when moving LEFT, the new head is (1,9), and the body is the previous head and the first two body parts. So the new body would be [ (2,9), (3,9), (4,9) ].\n\nSo after moving LEFT, the snake's body is now 1,9; 2,9; 3,9. Then, in the next move, if I move LEFT again to 0,9, but then the body would be 1,9; 2,9. But 0,9 is not an apple. But maybe moving DOWN from (1,9) to (1,8) could be a path towards (1,7) apple. That's two steps down. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (2,8) and then LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7) which is an apple. That would take three moves, but maybe possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (2,8), then LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7) to get the apple. That's three moves. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nBut also, need to avoid collision with the enemy. The enemy snake is at (2,1) with a long body. Their movement this turn is unknown, but their head is at (2,1). If I move LEFT to (1,9), they might not interfere. However, if they move up towards me, but their body is at y=1 and 2. So probably not a direct collision.\n\nAnother consideration: moving DOWN to (2,8). From there, possible moves. Let's see. If I move DOWN, then next turn I could go LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). That's a possible path to the (1,7) apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT from (2,9) to (1,9) and then DOWN to (1,8), then DOWN again to (1,7). Either way, it's two or three moves.\n\nBut also, need to check if moving DOWN or LEFT would lead to situations where future moves are blocked. For example, if I move DOWN to (2,8), then my body is at 3,9;4,9;5,9. So next moves can't go into those positions. But moving LEFT to (1,9) seems safer in terms of keeping options open.\n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake's body is at (3,1), (4,1), etc. So if I move LEFT or DOWN, I'm not near them. So collision risk is low.\n\nNow, the priority is to eat apples. The apples I have collected are 3, and the enemy has 8. So I need to collect more apples to either surpass them or reach 30. The apples left are (2,0), (1,7), (0,1), (9,7). Wait, the initial apples listed are (0,0), (2,0), (1,7), (0,1), (9,7). But my snake has collected 3, and the enemy 8. So maybe some apples are already eaten. The remaining ones would be the ones not collected. But the problem statement says \"apples at\" those positions. Wait, maybe all those apples are still present unless collected. Wait, the problem says \"apples collected: 3\" for my snake. So I have collected 3 apples, but the total apples available are the ones listed. So perhaps some of those apples have been eaten by me or others. But since the enemy has 8, which is more than the total apples listed (5), that's confusing. Wait, the initial apples listed are 5 positions. But the enemy has 8 apples. That suggests that maybe the apples are respawning or there are more apples. But according to the problem statement, the apples are at those positions. So maybe the apples are static and once collected, they're gone. But the enemy has 8, which is more than the total listed. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the apples listed are all the apples on the board. So the enemy has collected 8, but there are only 5 apples. That can't be. So perhaps the apples are respawning, or the count is different. Maybe the problem statement is correct, and the apples are at those positions, but perhaps some are collected by me and others by the enemy. Wait, the apples at (0,0), (2,0), (1,7), (0,1), (9,7) are the positions. So total 5 apples. But my snake has 3, enemy 8. That's impossible. Unless the apples are recreated after being eaten. But the problem statement doesn't mention that. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup. But perhaps I should proceed with the given data.\n\nAssuming that the apples are still present at those positions unless collected. So I need to collect the remaining ones. But since the enemy has 8, which is more than 5, maybe the apples are being collected multiple times or there's a mistake. But perhaps I should proceed as per the given info.\n\nIn any case, my goal is to collect apples. So the remaining apples I can collect are (2,0), (1,7), (0,1), (9,7). Because I have 3, enemy 8. But maybe some are already taken. But since the problem states the apples at those positions, perhaps they are all still there. So I need to collect as many as possible.\n\nSo moving towards (1,7) or (2,0) or (0,1) or (9,7). Which direction is better?\n\nLooking at my current position (2,9), moving LEFT to (1,9) brings me closer to (1,7). Moving DOWN to (2,8) is also a step towards (2,0) or (1,7). Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), then next move could be DOWN to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7) (apple). That's two moves after this. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) then LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first gives me a clearer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) could also allow me to go LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). Same path. But perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it's one step towards (1,7).\n\nAnother consideration: after moving LEFT, my new head is at (1,9). Then, the next move could be LEFT again to (0,9), but that's not an apple. Or DOWN to (1,8). Alternatively, moving DOWN from (1,9) to (1,8), then LEFT to (0,8), etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (2,8), then I can move LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). That's three moves. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake is at (2,1) with a long body. If I move LEFT, I'm moving away from their direction. If they move up, maybe towards my position, but their body is at y=1 and 2. So unless they move up a lot, which is unlikely. So collision risk is low.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN, which is better? Let's think about future moves. If I move LEFT to (1,9), then next move I can go DOWN to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7) (apple). That's two moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (2,8), then LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). Also three moves. Either way, same number of steps. But maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct path towards (1,7).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is better because it's a straight line towards the lower part of the board. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. For example, if moving DOWN to (2,8), then next move could be LEFT to (1,8), but is that safe? The enemy's body is at (3,1), (4,1), etc. So (1,8) is safe. So both moves seem safe.\n\nAnother factor: avoiding getting stuck. For example, if I move LEFT to (1,9), then next move, if I go LEFT again to (0,9), that's a dead end. But if I go DOWN, then I can proceed. So maybe moving LEFT first allows more flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) might be better because it's a step towards the lower apples. But I need to see which path is safer and leads to more apples.\n\nAnother thing: the apple at (9,7) is on the right side. To reach that, I would need to move RIGHT, but that's currently blocked by my own body. So that's not an option now. So the main apples I can target are (1,7), (2,0), (0,1). \n\nThe apple at (0,1) is near the bottom left. To reach that, I'd need to move LEFT and then DOWN. For example, (2,9) -> (1,9) -> (0,9) -> (0,8) -> ... but that's a long way. Alternatively, (2,9) -> (2,8) -> (2,7) -> ... but that's not helpful. So maybe (1,7) is the closest achievable apple.\n\nSo the best target is (1,7). To get there from (2,9), the path would be LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN twice. Or DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). Either way, two or three moves. But since each turn is a move, I need to plan for future steps.\n\nBut in this turn, I have to choose between LEFT and DOWN. Let's consider the immediate next steps.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (1,8). Then next turn DOWN again to (1,7) to collect the apple. That's two more moves. But during those moves, I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8), then LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). Same number of steps. So both options are similar in terms of steps needed.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a straighter path towards (1,7). Also, moving LEFT now could allow me to have more options in the next move. For example, after LEFT, I can choose to go DOWN or LEFT again. But moving LEFT again would take me to (0,9), which is not an apple. So maybe DOWN is better.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (2,8), then I can move LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). That's three moves. But maybe that's manageable.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving LEFT, my body is now at (2,9), (3,9), (4,9). So next move, if I go DOWN to (1,8), my body would be (1,9), (2,9), (3,9). So no collision. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (2,8), then LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). All steps are safe.\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it's one step towards the target apple. Also, moving LEFT now might allow me to have a clear path next turn. \n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake's head is at (2,1). If I move LEFT, I'm moving away from their x-coordinate (2 to 1). If they move up, maybe they could approach my position, but their body is at y=1 and 2. So unless they move up multiple times, which is possible. But since they have 8 apples, maybe they are in a different part of the board. \n\nIn any case, the immediate collision risk is low for both LEFT and DOWN. So the choice is between which direction gets me closer to an apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN could also help in avoiding a potential dead end. For example, if I move LEFT and then get stuck, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAnother point: the apples at (0,0) and (0,1) are at the bottom left. To reach those, I would need to go LEFT and then DOWN. But that's a longer path. The apple at (2,0) is at the bottom middle. Moving DOWN from (2,9) to (2,8), then (2,7), etc., would take 9 steps to reach (2,0). That's a lot. So maybe (1,7) is a better target.\n\nSo the optimal path is towards (1,7). So moving LEFT first seems better. \n\nBut wait, when I move LEFT to (1,9), the next move could be DOWN to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). So two moves. That's manageable. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (2,8), then LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). Also three moves. So same number of steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct step towards the apple. Also, moving LEFT now might allow me to have more options in the next move. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake's movement. If they move in a way that could block my path, but I can't predict that. So I have to assume they might move in any direction. \n\nBut given that, moving LEFT or DOWN are both safe. \n\nAnother factor: the game rules state that if another snake's head moves into my body, they die. But that's not my main concern here. My main concern is to survive and collect apples.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN, which is better? \n\nLet me think about the next possible moves. If I choose LEFT:\n\nCurrent move: LEFT to (1,9). Then next turn, possible moves: LEFT (0,9), DOWN (1,8), or RIGHT (back to 2,9). But RIGHT would be into my own body, since after moving LEFT, the body is [ (2,9), (3,9), (4,9) ]. So moving RIGHT would go to (2,9), which is now part of the body. So that's invalid. So next move options would be LEFT or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose DOWN next, then I can proceed towards (1,7). So that's a viable path.\n\nIf I choose DOWN now to (2,8), then next move could be LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). \n\nSo both options are possible. But maybe moving LEFT now allows me to start moving towards (1,7) in a straight line. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN could be part of a path towards (2,0) apple. But (2,0) is further away. \n\nSince the apple at (1,7) is closer, I should prioritize that. \n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if moving LEFT is safe. The new head position (1,9) must not be in any snake's body. My own body after moving would be [ (2,9), (3,9), (4,9) ]. The enemy's body is at (3,1), (4,1), etc. So (1,9) is safe. \n\nYes. So LEFT is a valid move. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (2,8) is also safe. \n\nBut which one is better? \n\nAnother angle: after moving LEFT, the snake's body is shorter, which might make it easier to maneuver. But that's not necessarily true. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is better because it's a straight line towards the lower apples. But I think (1,7) is a better target. \n\nSo I think the best choice is LEFT. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the apples again. The apple at (0,1) is at the bottom left. If I move LEFT, I can eventually reach that. But (1,7) is closer. \n\nYes, (1,7) is at y=7, which is 2 steps down from (1,9). So moving LEFT then DOWN twice would get there. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (2,8), then LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7). Same number of steps. \n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct step towards the x-coordinate of the apple (1,7). \n\nSo I think the answer is LEFT.\nLEFT",

The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each.\n\nUP: From (2,9) moving up would take me to (2,10), which is out of bounds. So UP is invalid. Dead.\n\nRIGHT: Moving to (3,9), which is my own body. That's invalid. Dead.\n\nSo only DOWN and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, between DOWN and LEFT. Which is better?\n\nLet's think about the apples. The apples are at (0,0), (2,0), (1,7), (0,1), (9,7). My snake has 3 apples, enemy 9. So I need to collect more.\n\nCurrent position (2,9). Let's see which direction gets me closer to an apple.\n\nLEFT would take me to (1,9). From there, next steps could be down towards (1,7) apple. That's two steps down. Alternatively, moving DOWN from (2,9) to (2,8), then left to (1,8), then down to (1,7). Same number of steps.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first is better because it's a direct step towards the x-coordinate of (1,7). Also, after moving LEFT, the next move could be DOWN, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might be safer in terms of not getting stuck. But I need to check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nAlso, need to consider future moves. If I move LEFT, then next turn I can go DOWN. If I move DOWN, then next turn LEFT. Both seem possible.\n\nBut another thing: the enemy snake's position. Their head is at (2,1), with a long body. If I move LEFT, I'm moving away from their x-coordinate. If they move up, maybe they could approach, but their body is at y=1 and 2. So unless they move up a lot, which is possible, but not sure. But since they have 9 apples, maybe they are in a different area.\n\nSo collision risk seems low for both moves.\n\nAnother factor: after moving LEFT, my body would be (2,9), (3,9), (4,9). So next move, if I go DOWN to (1,8), that's safe. Similarly, moving DOWN first would lead to (2,8), then left to (1,8), then down to (1,7).\n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it's one step towards the apple. Also, moving LEFT might keep more options open. For example, if I move LEFT, then next turn I can go DOWN or LEFT again. But moving LEFT again would take me to (0,9), which isn't an apple. So maybe DOWN is better.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first allows me to go LEFT in the next step. Both seem viable.\n\nBut considering that (1,7) is an apple, and moving LEFT first brings me closer in the x-direction, I think LEFT is the better choice. It's a direct step towards the apple's x-coordinate, and then the y can be addressed in the next moves.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT and DOWN. I think LEFT is better here.\nLEFT",

The apples I haven't collected yet are at (1,7), (0,0), (2,0), (9,7). The enemy has 9 apples, so I need to catch up.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9), next turn I can go DOWN to (1,8), then DOWN again to (1,7) which has an apple. That's two moves to get that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (2,8), then LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7) would take three moves. Moving LEFT first seems more efficient.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT brings me closer to the apple at (1,7) in the x-direction. The enemy's head is at (2,1), which is pretty far south. Unless they move up, they might not interfere. The body parts of the enemy are along y=0 and y=1, so moving left from (2,9) doesn't seem to risk collision with them immediately.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that moving LEFT leaves me with options to go DOWN or LEFT again. If I keep moving LEFT, I might reach (0,9), but that's not an apple. So after LEFT, moving DOWN makes more sense. \n\nOn the other hand, moving DOWN first allows me to go LEFT next turn, which also leads towards the same apple. But that's an extra move. So LEFT seems better as the immediate step towards the apple.\n\nI should also check if there are any other apples in the vicinity. The (9,7) apple is on the opposite side, which is far. The (0,0) and (2,0) are at the bottom, but moving LEFT might not directly help there. \n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to get closer to the (1,7) apple.\nLEFT",
