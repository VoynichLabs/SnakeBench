The board is 10x10.\n\nAvailable apples are at: (5, 6), (9, 7), (2, 3), (3, 9), (5, 8).\nThe nearest apple seems to be (5, 8).\n\nLet's evaluate safe moves from (0, 8):\n\n1.  **UP (to (0, 9))**: Safe. On the board.\n2.  **DOWN (to (0, 7))**: Safe. On the board.\n3.  **LEFT (to (-1, 8))**: Kills me (off board).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (1, 8))**: Safe. On the board.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nMy objective is to get apples. The nearest apples are (5, 8) and (3, 9).\n\n*   **Apple (5, 8)**: 5 steps right, 0 steps up/down.\n*   **Apple (3, 9)**: 3 steps right, 1 step up.\n\nLet's assess the direction towards the apples.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (0, 9): I am closer to (3, 9). Distance to (3, 9) is 3 horizontal steps. Distance to (5, 8) is 5 horizontal + 1 down step (Manhattan distance 6).\nIf I move **DOWN** to (0, 7): I am further from (3, 9). Distance to (5, 8) is 5 horizontal + 1 up step (Manhattan distance 6).\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (1, 8): I am moving directly towards both (5, 8) and (3, 9). Distance to (5, 9) is 4 horizontal + 1 up. Distance to (5, 8) is 4 horizontal.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems optimal as it decreases the distance to (5, 8) immediately, which is the closest apple (4 steps away after this move).\n\nLet's check the enemy snake (Snake #0) at (9, 3). It is far away and won't interfere with my chosen move (RIGHT). Snake #0 will likely move towards the apples closer to it, like (9, 7) or (5, 6).\n\nIf I choose RIGHT, my position will be (1, 8). I will be setting myself up to move right towards (5, 8) or possibly up towards (3, 9).\n\nIf I choose UP, my position will be (0, 9). Then I would need to move RIGHT to reach (3, 9) or move DOWN and RIGHT to reach (5, 8). While (3, 9) is only 3 steps away horizontally, moving RIGHT now keeps the option open to choose either (5, 8) (4 steps away) or (3, 9) (3 right, 1 down, or 3 right if I was at (0,9)). Since (5, 8) is at the same vertical level as me, moving RIGHT is the most direct path towards it.\n\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\nPlan for next turns: Move towards (5, 8). (1, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) (Apple in 4 turns).\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 will likely pursue A2 (9, 7) or A1 (5, 6). Any move I make towards (5, 8) is highly unlikely to result in a head-on collision or immediate danger from Snake #0 this turn. Snake #0's closest apple is A2 (1 step away if it moves right to (9, 3) or up/right to (9, 4), or 4 steps away to (9, 7)). It's most likely moving towards A2 (9, 7) or A1 (5, 6), both of which are far from me.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 8) directly reduces the distance to the target apple (5, 8) and maintains maximum flexibility.\n\n**Future Plan:** Continue moving RIGHT towards (5, 8): (1, 8) -> **(2, 8)** -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) (Eat apple on turn 4).\n\nRIGHT",

Decision:**\nMove UP to collect Apple A4 at (3, 9).\n\n**Future Plan:**\nAfter eating A4 at (3, 9), the snake will have length 2 (Head at (3, 9), Tail at (3, 8)). The next closest apple is A5=(5, 8).\nFrom (3, 9), the path to (5, 8) requires moving DOWN to (3, 8), then RIGTH/RIGHT.\nAnother close apple is A2=(9, 7).\n\n*   If I move UP: New location (3, 9) [Eats A4]. Next target: A5 (5, 8). Distance 3 steps (down, right, right).\n*   If I move RIGHT: New location (4, 8). Next target: A5 (5, 8). Distance 1 step (right).\n\nEven though moving RIGHT now would maintain the faster path to A5 (eating it on T4), eating A4 now (T3) guarantees an apple sooner. Having a body segment will also protect the rear of the snake slightly, though the size 2 snake is still very vulnerable.\n\nIt is better to secure the immediate point.\n\nUP",
