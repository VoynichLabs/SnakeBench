If we head left to (5,0), we get the apple and grow.\n- Apples at (7,9), (3,8), (7,7), and (5,9) are farther away and probably less immediately accessible.\n- Moving right from (6,1) to (7,1) would be a step toward apples at (7,7) and (7,9), but those are higher up and farther away.\n- Moving up would bring us toward the apple at (7,9) but currently seems risky given the position of the apple and spacing; also, the (7,9) is two steps away vertically.\n- Moving left to (5,1), then down to (5,0), should be the shortest path to the reachable apple at (5,0).\n\nPotential dangers:\n- Walls at y=0, but moving down to (6,0) is safe.\n- No obstacles directly blocking our way to (5,0).\n- No enemies nearby.\n\nNext step:\n- Moving down (DOWN) from (6,1) to (6,0) seems safe and opens a path to the apple at (5,0) on the next turn.\n\nStrategy:\n- Next turn, move down to reach (6,0), then move left to consume the apple, growing our snake and increasing points.\n\nDecision:\n- Move DOWN."
