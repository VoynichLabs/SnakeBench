Down would slam into my own tail, and Left would walk straight into the rival\u2019s head \u2013 both are instant death. So the only viable moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\nUP not only grabs the (8,9) apple (boosting my score to 2) but also pushes me toward the top\u2011right corridor where a cluster of apples waits. It also forces the opponent to react; they can\u2019t hop onto (8,9) in a single step, so they\u2019ll have to chase elsewhere. RIGHT would just shuffle me to the edge with no immediate gain and would limit my future options to only UP or DOWN, which could trap me later.\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Current snapshot**  \n- My head: (8,8)  \n- Rival head: (7,8)  \n- Safe moves: UP, RIGHT  \n\n**Why UP is the golden ticket**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Eats the apple now \u2192 +1 point, length grows.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Positions me next to the (8,9) apple (the one I\u2019ll eat) and opens a pathway toward the top\u2011right where more apples lurk.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Keeps multiple escape routes open for the next few turns.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Puts pressure on the rival; they must avoid a head\u2011on collision while I\u2019m growing.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca1 **Plan for the next few turns**  \n- **Turn\u202f1:** Move UP to (8,9) and eat the apple.  \n- **Turn\u202f2:** Re\u2011evaluate the opponent\u2019s new head; if they\u2019re still at (7,8) or move toward (7,9), I can consider sliding RIGHT or LEFT to start a U\u2011shaped maneuver that funnels them into a wall.  \n- **Turn\u202f3+:** Keep expanding upward or eastward, always scanning for apples that also block opponent pathways, and maintain at least one free adjacent cell to stay flexible.\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Long\u2011term note for future self:**  \nPrioritize apple grabs that also cut off opponent routes, avoid lingering on edges unless I can box them, and always keep multiple safe follow\u2011up directions open.  \n\nUP",

The rival will vacate that cell (they can\u2019t stay still), so we survive and steal their spot. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 into (9,\u202f9), a corner that only lets us go DOWN next turn, cutting off future options. \u2705  \n\nWhy LEFT wins the tactical tug\u2011of\u2011war:  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Apple proximity** \u2013 Moving left pushes us toward the cluster of apples on the top row (e.g., (5,\u202f9), (0,\u202f9)).
