Moving DOWN will eat it!\n2. **Enemy proximity**: The enemy is 3 cells above and 2 cells left. They're not immediately threatening.\n3. **Future positioning**: Eating the apple at (7,4) will give me my first point and put me at 1 apple, tied with the enemy.\n\n**Enemy likely move analysis:**\nThe enemy has several apple options:\n- Apple at (9,9): Requires moving UP twice\n- Apple at (9,8): Requires moving RIGHT three times\n- Apple at (2,5): Requires moving LEFT three times and DOWN three times\n- Apple at (2,0): Requires moving LEFT three times and DOWN eight times\n\nThe enemy is most likely to move toward (9,9) or (9,8), so they'll probably move UP or RIGHT.\n\n**My move choice:**\nMoving DOWN to (7,4) will eat the apple and gain me 1 point. The enemy is unlikely to also move to that cell since they'd need to move DOWN twice to get there, and they're more likely to go UP or RIGHT toward the apples at (9,9) or (9,8).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Eat the apple at (7,4) this turn to tie with the enemy\n- Next turn, consider moving toward (9,8) or (9,9) to chase the top-right apples\n- Maintain awareness of the enemy's position to avoid head-on collisions\n- Keep mobility options open and avoid getting boxed in\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is at (5, 7), so they're 3 RIGHT and 1 DOWN from (9, 8).\n2. **Enemy likely moves**: The enemy might go for (9, 8) (RIGHT then UP), (9, 9) (UP then RIGHT), or (2, 5) (LEFT then DOWN twice). They're equally likely to go UP or RIGHT.\n3. **My options**: \n   - RIGHT to (8, 4): Gets me closer to (9, 8) and (9, 9)\n   - LEFT to (6, 4): Less optimal for reaching apples quickly\n   - DOWN to (7, 3): Moving away from immediate apple opportunities\n\n**Enemy prediction:**\nSince the enemy is equally likely to go UP or RIGHT, I can't rely on them blocking a specific path to (9, 8). I need to be proactive.\n\n**My move choice:**\nRIGHT to (8, 4) is best. It:\n- Avoids going backwards into my body (UP is blocked)\n- Moves me closer to the apple at (9, 8)\n- Keeps my options open for next turn\n- Doesn't move away from apple opportunities like DOWN would\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Move RIGHT to get closer to (9, 8)\n- Next turn, if (9, 8) is still available, move UP to eat it and tie with the enemy at 2 apples each\n- After that, consider the apple at (9, 9) or (2, 5) depending on the enemy's position\n- Maintain awareness of the enemy's movements to avoid head-on collisions while pursuing apples aggressively\n\nRIGHT",

Secures col2 row8 control, tail clears row9 progressively (next drops (5,9)). Open paths south/east. Enemy len2 weak (safe moves LEFT/DOWN likely; can't reach (2,5) fast \u22655 turns). Maintains lead 6-1, space dominance row8-9.\n- **LEFT**: To (0,8) west edge, no apple progress. Exposes col2 row8 to enemy (poss UP+RIGHT). Delays (2,5), risks congestion self-body row9 col0-5. Suboptimal vs. RIGHT momentum.\n\nRIGHT optimal: execute plan, path to +1 at (2,5), deny enemy south apples (2,0/1). Enemy irrelevant.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** DOWN (2,7 vacated)\u2192DOWN (2,6)\u2192DOWN (2,5 eat). Tail clears row9 x5 t19, x4 t20. Post-eat (2,5) len8, sweep east (5,4)/(8,5): RIGHTx3-DOWN.

From (2, 6), I can move DOWN to (2, 5) on the next turn to collect the apple.\n\n**Enemy prediction:**\nThe enemy cannot move UP (into their own body at (2, 9)) or LEFT (into their own body at (1, 8)). They can only move DOWN to (2, 7) or RIGHT to (3, 8).\n\n**Critical analysis:**\n- If I move DOWN to (1, 5), the enemy can move DOWN to (2, 7) or RIGHT to (3, 8).

Enemy unreachable (poss newheads: (0,6),(1,5),(2,6); new body includes oldhead(1,6)+oldbody(1,7 drop)).\n- **LEFT** (1,8): Own neck/backwards \u2192 self-collision (new body starts (1,8),(2,8),(1,8)... duplicate). Death.\n- **RIGHT** (3,8): Empty. Not backwards. Safe (new body: (3,8),(2,8),(1,8),(1,9),(2,9),(3,9),(4,9); drops (5,9), no collision). Enemy unreachable.\n\nSafe: DOWN, RIGHT (no eat).\n\n### Strategic Evaluation\n- **DOWN**: Direct -1 dist to (2,5) (now 2). Positions ideally above contested col2. Enemy fastest to (2,5): RIGHT(2,6)t19-DOWN eat t20 (len3). My follow: t20 DOWN(2,6) collides enemy body (retains prior head), so pivot RIGHT(3,7)-DOWN(3,6)-RIGHT(4,6)-RIGHT(5,6)-DOWN(5,5)-DOWN(5,4 eat t24, dist6 post-pivot).

Good for east sweep (5,4 dist6: RIGHTx2-DOWNx4), but cedes (2,5) uncontested (enemy 2t vs my 4t+). Fewer col2 options, row8 linear (vulnerable if enemy north? unlikely).\n\nDOWN superior: hedges enemy intercept (pivot east viable, lead 6-1\u21926-2 safe), keeps col2 dominance/options vs RIGHT detour.

Safe.\n- **RIGHT** (3,9): Own neck. Backward. Death.\n\nSafe: DOWN, LEFT. Enemy safe moves (UP/LEFT/RIGHT from (4,6)) cannot reach (1,9) or (2,8); no collision risk.\n\n### Strategic Evaluation\n- **LEFT** (1,9): Eat apple (+1 to 12, lead +8). Short-term gain, top-left clear. Positions for future apples.\n- **DOWN** (2,8): Safe but no apple; abandons immediate (1,9) (enemy ~6 moves away, safe to take). Crowds mid-top, fewer options vs. LEFT's openness.\n\nLEFT optimal (eat now, maintain lead/speed, open left edge).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** LEFT(1,9 eat=12)t43\u2192DOWN(1,8)t44\u2192DOWN(1,7)t45\u2192... straight DOWN col1 to (1,1)A eat~t51 (+1=~13, col1 clear). Enemy may take (0,6) in ~4 moves; ignore, uncontestable (its 4 vs. my 5). Post-(1,1), RIGHT/DOWN to (4,0)A or (6,3)A (monitor enemy growth/path). Tail lags right; left safe. Avoid row6 left if enemy contests.\n\nLEFT",
