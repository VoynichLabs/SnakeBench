Body: none.\nApples are at: (2, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 6), (3, 8).\n\nLet's evaluate safe moves for Snake 1 (at T=0, no body, so only boundary and head-on collision checks matter).\n\nCurrent position: (8, 9)\n\n1. **UP**: (8, 10). Out of bounds (Y > 9). **UNSAFE**.\n2. **DOWN**: (8, 8). Safe. Moves towards apples (3, 8).\n3. **LEFT**: (7, 9). Safe.\n4. **RIGHT**: (9, 9). Safe.\n\nAll safe moves lead to an empty square, except for potential head-on conflicts with Snake 0.\n\nSnake 0 is at (3, 7). Snake 1 is at (8, 9). They are far apart. Head-on collision is impossible this turn.\n\nWe need to choose a move that brings us closer to apples.\n\nApples are at:\nA1: (2, 5) - Manhatten distance from (8, 9): $|8-2| + |9-5| = 6 + 4 = 10$\nA2: (6, 4) - Distance: $|8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7$\nA3: (6, 3) - Distance: $|8-6| + |9-3| = 2 + 6 = 8$\nA4: (6, 6) - Distance: $|8-6| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5$\nA5: (3, 8) - Distance: $|8-3| + |9-8| = 5 + 1 = 6$\n\nThe closest apple is A4 (6, 6) at distance 5, and the second closest is A5 (3, 8) at distance 6.\n\nLet's see how each safe move changes the distance to these closest apples:\n\n**Target A5 (3, 8)**\n* Current distance: 6 (5 horizontal, 1 vertical)\n* DOWN (8, 8): New distance $|8-3| + |8-8| = 5 + 0 = 5$. **Good.**\n* LEFT (7, 9): New distance $|7-3| + |9-8| = 4 + 1 = 5$. **Good.**\n* RIGHT (9, 9): New distance $|9-3| + |9-8| = 6 + 1 = 7$. **Bad.**\n\n**Target A4 (6, 6)**\n* Current distance: 5 (2 horizontal, 3 vertical)\n* DOWN (8, 8): New distance $|8-6| + |8-6| = 2 + 2 = 4$. **Good.**\n* LEFT (7, 9): New distance $|7-6| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4$. **Good.**\n* RIGHT (9, 9): New distance $|9-6| + |9-6| = 3 + 3 = 6$. **Bad.**\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT decrease the distance to the closest apples (A4 and A5).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 8), we are directly in line with A4 (6, 6) and A5 (3, 8) vertically (y=8 to y=9/8) and still far right (x=8).\nIf we move LEFT to (7, 9), we get closer horizontally to A4 (x=6) and A5 (x=3), but stay high up (y=9).\n\nIf we aim for A4 (6, 6), moving LEFT seems slightly better as it positions us (7, 9) only 1 unit right of the target X coordinate (6). If we move DOWN, we are at (8, 8), still 2 units right of X=6.\n\nHowever, A5 is at (3, 8). Moving DOWN puts us at (8, 8), same Y coordinate as A5. This looks like a direct path.\nMoving LEFT puts us at (7, 9), still 1 unit above A5.\n\nSince A5 (3, 8) is potentially contested by Snake 0 (Head at 3, 7), we must consider Snake 0's movements. Snake 0 is at (3, 7).\nSnake 0 moves (3, 7):\n* UP: (3, 8) -> **Eats A5!**\n* DOWN: (3, 6)\n* LEFT: (2, 7)\n* RIGHT: (4, 7)\n\nIf Snake 0 moves UP, they will eat A5 (3, 8) immediately. This is highly likely as A5 is Snake 0's closest apple (distance 1).\n\nWe should probably aim for A4 (6, 6) or A2 (6, 4) which are further away from Snake 0.\n\nLet's focus on A4 (6, 6).\nCurrent: (8, 9). Target (6, 6).\nDOWN -> (8, 8). Distance 4. Needs L, L, D, D.\nLEFT -> (7, 9). Distance 4. Needs L, D, D, D or D, D, D, L.\n\nMoving LEFT leads to (7, 9). This positions us better to move towards X=6.\nFrom (7, 9), we can go DOWN to (7, 8), then (7, 7), then LEFT to (6, 7), then DOWN to (6, 6). This is an LDDD path.\nIf we go DOWN first to (8, 8). Then (8, 7), (8, 6), then LEFT to (7, 6), LEFT to (6, 6). This is DDDLL path.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are good first steps towards A4 (6, 6).\n\nLet's check A2 (6, 4) and A3 (6, 3). They are both in the same column X=6.\nA2 (6, 4) distance 7.\nA3 (6, 3) distance 8.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (7, 9): Future options look wide open.\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 8): Future options look wide open.\n\nConsidering the proximity to the board edge:\nIf we move LEFT to (7, 9), we are away from the right edge (x=9) but remain near the top edge (y=9).\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 8), we are away from the top edge (y=9) but remain near the right edge (x=9).\n\nSince we want to generally move left (X=8 -> X=6) and down (Y=9 -> Y=6), moving LEFT or DOWN is equally strategic for now.\n\nLet's stick to the closest available apple that Snake 0 is unlikely to grab: A4 (6, 6).\n(8, 9) -> A4 (6, 6). Needs 2 LEFT, 3 DOWN.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 9), I've completed 1/2 of the required LEFT moves.\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 8), I've completed 1/3 of the required DOWN moves.\n\nSince the Y coordinate (9) is on the boundary and we only have 1 cell margin (8, 9 -> 8, 10 is death), moving away from the Y boundary seems slightly safer for long-term maneuverability, although negligible right now.\n\nLet's choose DOWN (8, 8). This positions my X coordinate consistently and starts dropping Y towards X=6.\n\nIf I choose LEFT, the position is (7, 9). My Y is still pinned against the top.\n(7, 9) -> (6, 9) LEFT -> (6, 8) DOWN -> (6, 7) DOWN -> (6, 6) DOWN. Requires LDDD.\n\nIf I choose DOWN, the position is (8, 8).\n(8, 8) -> (7, 8) LEFT -> (6, 8) LEFT -> (6, 7) DOWN -> (6, 6) DOWN. Requires LDLLDD. Wait, (8, 8) to (6, 6) requires 2 left, 2 down movements.\n\nPath 1 (Start LEFT): (8, 9) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (7, 9) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (7, 8) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (7, 7) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (6, 7) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (6, 6). Total 4 moves. LDDLD is a bit erratic.\nPath 2 (Start DOWN): (8, 9) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (8, 8) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (8, 7) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (7, 7) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (6, 7) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (6, 6). Total 4 moves. DDLLD.\n\nLet's find the shortest path: 2 L, 3 D required. Total 5 moves.\n(8, 9) -> (6, 6).\nL L D D D or\nD L D L D or\nD D L L D\n\nIf I choose DOWN to (8, 8): I need 2 L, 2 D remaining. 4 moves total. $8 \\to 6$ (2 L), $8 \\to 6$ (2 D).\n(8, 8) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (8, 7) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (8, 6) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (7, 6) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (6, 6). (DDLL)\n\nIf I choose LEFT to (7, 9): I need 1 L, 3 D remaining. 4 moves total. $7 \\to 6$ (1 L), $9 \\to 6$ (3 D).\n(7, 9) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (6, 9) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (6, 8) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (6, 7) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (6, 6). (LDDD)\n\nBoth lead to the apple in 4 more turns (5 turns total). LDDD seems slightly more straightforward than DDLL if starting with LEFT. DDLL seems straightforward if starting with DOWN.\n\nLet's go with DOWN. This takes us away from the top edge and directly onto Y=8, which is shared by A5 (though contested) and is a good drop point for A4.\n\nStrategy for next few turns: Aim for A4 (6, 6) by moving DOWN, then DOWN, then execute the required LEFT moves.\nT1: DOWN to (8, 8)\nT2: DOWN to (8, 7)\nT3: LEFT to (7, 7) or DOWN to (8, 6). Given the path DDLL to (6, 6), T2 should be DOWN to (8, 7). Then T3: DOWN to (8, 6). T4: LEFT to (7, 6). T5: LEFT to (6, 6).\n\nLet's re-confirm the shortest path starting DOWN to (8, 8):\n(8, 9) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (8, 8)\nRemaining moves: 2 L, 2 D.\nSequence: D D L L\n(8, 8) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (8, 7)\n(8, 7) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (7, 7) <- Wait, should stick to X=8 for now to maximize future path options if apples change.\nNo, let's stick to the target.\n(8, 8) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (8, 7)\n(8, 7) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (8, 6)\n(8, 6) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (7, 6)\n(7, 6) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (6, 6) -- Apple gathered at T4. Total moves 4.\n\nIf I start LEFT:\n(8, 9) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (7, 9)\nRemaining 1 L, 3 D.\nL D D D\n(7, 9) $\\xrightarrow{L}$ (6, 9)\n(6, 9) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (6, 8)\n(6, 8) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (6, 7)\n(6, 7) $\\xrightarrow{D}$ (6, 6) -- Apple gathered at T4. Total moves 4.\n\nBoth moves reach the apple in 4 turns. I prefer DOWN to get away from the border Y=9 sooner.\n\nDOWN",

Body: none.\nApples are at: A1 (2, 5), A2 (6, 4), A3 (6, 3), A4 (6, 6), A5 (3, 8).\n\n**Snake 1 (8, 8) Safe Moves:**\n1. **UP**: (8, 9). Safe.\n2. **DOWN**: (8, 7). Safe.\n3. **LEFT**: (7, 8). Safe.\n4. **RIGHT**: (9, 8). Safe.\n\nAll four directions are currently safe for movement (no body to hit, no boundaries, no immediate head-on collision predicted as the enemy is far away).\n\n**Enemy Snake 0 (3, 6) Likely Move Analysis:**\nSnake 0 is close to A4 (6, 6) - Dist 3, A5 (3, 8) - Dist 2, A1 (2, 5) - Dist 1.\nIn the previous turn (T0), Snake 0 was at (3, 7) and A5 was at (3, 8). I predicted Snake 0 would move UP and eat A5.\nWait, let's look at the current board state derived from the input (which is Turn 1, *after* moves from Turn 0).\n\n*   My move T0: DOWN (8, 9) $\\to$ (8, 8).\n*   Snake 0 position in T0 was (3, 7).\n    *   If Snake 0 moved UP: (3, 8), it ate A5.\n    *   If Snake 0 moved DOWN/L/R: It did not eat A5.\n\nThe current list of apples shows (3, 8) is still an apple location (A5). This means Snake 0 **did not** move UP to (3, 8) during T0.\nIf Snake 0 moved to (3, 6) (current head position), it must have moved DOWN from (3, 7). Snake 0 now has distance 1 to A1 (2, 5) and distance 2 to A5 (3, 8).\n\nSnake 0 (3, 6) has an immediate apple at (2, 5) if they move LEFT.\nSnake 0 safe moves:\n*   UP (3, 7) - Moves towards A5 (Dist 1).\n*   DOWN (3, 5) - Safe.\n*   LEFT (2, 6) - Safe.\n*   RIGHT (4, 6) - Safe.\n\nGiven A1 (2, 5) is only 1 move away for Snake 0 (e.g., L $\\to$ (2, 6), then D $\\to$ (2, 5), or D $\\to$ (3, 5), then L $\\to$ (2, 5)), and A5 (3, 8) is also 2 moves away (U $\\to$ (3, 7), U $\\to$ (3, 8)), Snake 0 will likely prioritize an apple. A5 (3, 8) is a single UP move away if they can tolerate hitting (3, 7) first and then (3, 8). A1 (2, 5) is slightly more complex, requiring L and D. Given their previous passive move (DOWN from 3, 7 to 3, 6 despite A5 being right there), it's hard to predict definite aggression.\n\nThe closest apples for Snake 1 (8, 8) are:\n1.  A4 (6, 6): Distance $|8-6| + |8-6| = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n2.  A5 (3, 8): Distance $|8-3| + |8-8| = 5 + 0 = 5$.\n3.  A2 (6, 4): Distance $|8-6| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6$.\n\nWe are targeting A4 (6, 6), which requires 2 LEFT and 2 DOWN movements. We calculated in the previous turn that sequences like DDLL or LDLL (if we preferred a different order) would work.\n\n**Move Evaluation for Snake 1 (8, 8) towards A4 (6, 6):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (8, 7)**: Decreases distance to 3 (2L, 1D remaining). Good. (Path DDLL is D at T1, D at T2, L at T3, L at T4).\n2.  **LEFT (7, 8)**: Decreases distance to 3 (1L, 2D remaining). Good. (Path LDDL or LDDU/DLDD).\n3.  **UP (8, 9)**: Increases distance to 5. Bad.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 8)**: Increases distance to 5. Bad.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT maintain the 4-turn path to A4 (6, 6) and are optimal.\n\n*   If I choose **DOWN (8, 7)**: I've completed 1/2 Vertical moves. I am still far right (X=8).\n    Next moves: DOWN (8, 6), then LEFT (7, 6), LEFT (6, 6). (DDLL)\n*   If I choose **LEFT (7, 8)**: I've completed 1/2 Horizontal moves. I am still high up (Y=8).\n    Next moves: LEFT (6, 8), then DOWN (6, 7), DOWN (6, 6). (LLDD)\n\nLet's prioritize closing the horizontal gap, as the vertical gap is still large (8 $\\to$ 6). Moving LEFT to (7, 8) aligns us better with the X=6 column.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 8).\nT2: LEFT to (6, 8) - Now I'm aligned vertically with A4.\nT3: DOWN to (6, 7)\nT4: DOWN to (6, 6) - Apple eaten.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 7).\nT2: DOWN to (8, 6) - Now I'm aligned horizontally with A4.\nT3: LEFT to (7, 6)\nT4: LEFT to (6, 6) - Apple eaten.\n\nBoth paths are efficient (4 moves total). Since (8, 8) is not on an immediate boundary, either choice is fine. I will choose LEFT this time to immediately reduce the distance to the critical X coordinate (6).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nTarget A4 (6, 6). Path: LEFT (7, 8), LEFT (6, 8), DOWN (6, 7), DOWN (6, 6).

Body: none.\nApples are at: A1 (2, 5), A2 (6, 4), A3 (6, 3), A4 (6, 6), A5 (3, 8).\n\nMy current goal is A4 (6, 6).\nMy previous move was LEFT (8, 8) $\\to$ (7, 8).\nRemaining moves needed for A4 (6, 6) following the LLDD path:\n$L_2, D_1, D_2$. (3 moves remaining)\n\n**Enemy Snake 0 Analysis:**\nSnake 0 moved from (3, 6) to (4, 6). This was a RIGHT move, moving away from A1 (2, 5) and A5 (3, 8). Snake 0 is now exactly one unit away from A4 (6, 6) in terms of X distance, and 0 units in terms of Y distance.\nDistance 0 to A4 (6, 6): $|4-6| + |6-6| = 2$.\nDistance to A2 (6, 4): $|4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4$.\nDistance to A3 (6, 3): $|4-6| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5$.\nDistance to A1 (2, 5): $|4-2| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nDistance to A5 (3, 8): $|4-3| + |6-8| = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nSnake 0 is now clearly targeting the cluster of apples at X=6, and specifically A4 (6, 6) is the closest. Snake 0 will likely move RIGHT towards (5, 6) or (6, 6).\n\n**Snake 1 (7, 8) Safe Moves:**\n1. **UP**: (7, 9). Safe.\n2. **DOWN**: (7, 7). Safe.\n3. **LEFT**: (6, 8). Safe.\n4. **RIGHT**: (8, 8). Safe.\n\nAll directions are safe (no boundaries, no body, no collision risk with Snake 0 yet).\n\n**Move Evaluation for Snake 1 (7, 8) towards A4 (6, 6):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (6, 8)**: This is the optimal second step in the LLDD plan.\n    *   New position (6, 8). Distance to A4 (6, 6) is 2 (2 DOWN).\n    *   This aligns my snake vertically with the apple cluster.\n    *   Snake 0 (4, 6) is likely moving RIGHT to (5, 6). No collision risk.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 7)**: This delays the horizontal alignment.\n    *   New position (7, 7). Distance to A4 (6, 6) is 3 (1 LEFT, 1 DOWN).\n3.  **UP/RIGHT**: Moves away from the target. Bad.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 8) is the best choice to maintain speed toward A4 (6, 6) and challenge Snake 0.\n\n**Collision Check (T=2):**\n*   My candidate move: LEFT to (6, 8).\n*   Snake 0 (4, 6) most likely move is RIGHT to (5, 6) to close distance to A4 (6, 6).\n*   (6, 8) and (5, 6) are far apart. No collision risk.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves aggressively:\n*   (4, 6) $\\to$ (6, 6): Snake 0 cannot reach (6, 6) in one move.\n*   (4, 6) $\\to$ (5, 6) (RIGHT): Most likely.\n*   (4, 6) $\\to$ (4, 7) (UP): Less likely, moves away from A4.\n*   (4, 6) $\\to$ (3, 6) (LEFT): Unlikely, moves away from A4.\n*   (4, 6) $\\to$ (4, 5) (DOWN): Unlikely.\n\nI will stick to the plan: move LEFT to take the dominant path towards A4 (6, 6).\n\n**Long-term Plan (LLDD):**\nT=2: LEFT (7, 8) $\\to$ (6, 8). Now aligned vertically with A4.\nT=3: DOWN (6, 8) $\\to$ (6, 7).\nT=4: DOWN (6, 7) $\\to$ (6, 6). Apple collected.\nSnake 0 will likely reach (5, 6) at T=2, (6, 6) at T=3. If Snake 0 moves RIGHT for two turns, they will contest A4 (6, 6) on T=3, potentially leading to a head-on collision at T=3 if they move RIGHT again to (6, 6) and I move DOWN to (6, 7).\n\nWait, let's re-examine Snake 0 movement.\nT=1: (3, 6) $\\stackrel{R}{\\longrightarrow}$ (4, 6).\nIf Snake 0 moves R again: T=2 $\\to$ (5, 6). Dist to A4: 1.\nIf Snake 0 moves R again: T=3 $\\to$ (6, 6). Apple collected (if I don't get there).\n\nMy sequence:\nT=2: (7, 8) $\\stackrel{L}{\\longrightarrow}$ (6, 8).

Apple collected.\n\nIf Snake 0 pursues A4, they will reach it in T=3. I reach it in T=4. This is a losing race if they are aggressive.\n\nI must pivot if A4 is unreachable.\n\nLet's look at A5 (3, 8). Distance from (7, 8): 4 LEFT moves.\nL1: (6, 8)\nL2: (5, 8)\nL3: (4, 8)\nL4: (3, 8) - Apple collected.\nThis takes 4 turns.\n\nSnake 0 (4, 6). Distance to A5 (3, 8):\nD: (4, 7)\nU: (4, 8)\nL: (3, 8)\nMinimum distance for Snake 0 is 3 moves: (4, 6) $\\stackrel{U}{\\longrightarrow}$ (4, 7) $\\stackrel{U}{\\longrightarrow}$ (4, 8) $\\stackrel{L}{\\longrightarrow}$ (3, 8).\n\nIf I continue LEFT now: (6, 8). This is 3 moves away from A5 (3, 8).\nIf Snake 0 continues RIGHT: (5, 6). Distance to A5 is 4.\n\nIf I shift to target A5 (3, 8) using the LLLL path:\nT=2: LEFT (6, 8)\nT=3: LEFT (5, 8)\nT=4: LEFT (4, 8)\nT=5: LEFT (3, 8) - Apple collected. (5 turns total from start (8, 8))\n\nThe only way I win A4 is if Snake 0 deviates from the RIGHT path. Given their move R $\\to$ (4, 6) in T=1 (moving closer to X=6), they are likely committed to X=6.\n\nIf I stick to A4, I might lose the race and get forced out or trapped.\n(7, 8) $\\stackrel{L}{\\longrightarrow}$ (6, 8). This move is still useful for A5 (3, 8).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT two times (T=2 $\\to$ (5, 6), T=3 $\\to$ (6, 6)), they get the apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT now, (6, 8). I am 3 moves from A5.\nIf Snake 0 moves UP-UP-LEFT (3 moves) they get A5 on T=4.\n\nI am not competitive for A4 (6, 6). I must switch targets.\n\nNew Target: A5 (3, 8).\nCurrent pos: (7, 8). Required: 4 LEFT moves.\nT=2: LEFT (6, 8).\nT=3: LEFT (5, 8).\nT=4: LEFT (4, 8).\nT=5: LEFT (3, 8).\n\nSnake 0 (4, 6). Path to A5 (3, 8): UU L (3 moves).\nT=2: UP (4, 7)\nT=3: UP (4, 8)\nT=4: LEFT (3, 8) - Snake 0 gets A5.\n\nI lose A5 as well! My current location (7, 8) makes me too slow for this apple as Snake 0 is only 3 moves away.\n\nI should attempt to intercept Snake 0 instead, or aim for a less contested apple.\n\nA1 (2, 5), A2 (6, 4), A3 (6, 3).\n\nA1 (2, 5). Current (7, 8). Dist: $|7-2| + |8-5| = 5 + 3 = 8$. Too far.\n\nA2 (6, 4). Dist: $|7-6| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5$.\nPath L, D, D, D, D.\nT=2: LEFT (6, 8). (Now aligned on X=6)\nT=3: DOWN (6, 7).\nT=4: DOWN (6, 6). (A4 location)\nT=5: DOWN (6, 5).\nT=6: DOWN (6, 4). Apple collected. (5 moves total)\n\nA3 (6, 3). Dist: $|7-6| + |8-3| = 1 + 5 = 6$.\nPath L, D, D, D, D, D. (6 moves total)\n\nSnake 0 (4, 6). To A2 (6, 4). Dist: 4. R, R, D, D. Reaches T=5.\nTo A3 (6, 3). Dist: 5. R, R, D, D, D. Reaches T=6.\n\nIf I target A2 (6, 4): I reach it on T=6 (5 moves). Snake 0 reaches it on T=5 (4 moves). I am slower.\n\n**Conclusion:** I am slow for all the closest apples. A4 (6, 6) and A5 (3, 8) are going to Snake 0. I must attempt a better position or stick to the longest efficient path for an apple, hoping Snake 0 consumes A4 and A5, allowing me to take the remaining X=6 column apples.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 8):\nI am positioned exactly above the X=6 apple cluster (A2, A3, A4 (likely gone)).\nIf Snake 0 takes A4 at T=3, they are at (6, 6), size 1.\nIf Snake 0 takes A5 at T=4, they are at (3, 8), size 2 (or 1 depending on where they move after A4).\n\nAssuming Snake 0 aims for A4 (6, 6) first (T=3):\nT=2: S0 $\\to$ (5, 6). S1 $\\to$ (6, 8) [LEFT].\nT=3: S0 $\\to$ (6, 6) [EATS A4]. S1 $\\to$ (6, 7) [DOWN]. (S0 is now size 1, Body: (5, 6)).\n\nNow S0 (6, 6) has consumed A4. Where to next? A2 (6, 4) or A3 (6, 3) are right there. The optimal move for S0 now is DOWN to (6, 5), size 1 body remains at (5, 6).\nS1 (6, 7) is one square above S0's expected move path.\n\nT=4: S0 (6, 6) $\\stackrel{D}{\\longrightarrow}$ (6, 5). S1 (6, 7) $\\stackrel{D}{\\longrightarrow}$ (6, 6). This is the location A4 *was*.\nT=5: S0 (6, 5) $\\stackrel{D}{\\longrightarrow}$ (6, 4) [EATS A2]. S1 (6, 6) $\\stackrel{D}{\\longrightarrow}$ (6, 5).\n\nIf I continue DOWN after missing A4, I will run right into Snake 0's body or trajectory.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Go to A5 (3, 8) and cut S0 off if possible.**\nIf S0 takes A4 at T=3, S0 is at (6, 6). If they decide to go for A5 (3, 8) next, they have to travel LLLU (3 steps).\nT=4: S0 $\\to$ (5, 6). S1 $\\to$ (5, 8) [LEFT].\nT=5: S0 $\\to$ (4, 6). S1 $\\to$ (4, 8) [LEFT].\nT=6: S0 $\\to$ (3, 6). S1 $\\to$ (3, 8) [EATS A5].\n\nThis is a feasible strategy if Snake 0 decides to move away from the X=6 cluster after securing one apple. If they try to secure A2/A3, I take A5.\n\nRegardless of my final target, moving LEFT to (6, 8) is a necessary step:\n1. It aligns me for the X=6 cluster (A2, A3).\n2. It continues the path towards A5 (3, 8).\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the tactical move for Turn 2. I will reassess the race on Turn 3.\n\nLEFT\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nT=3 will be critical. If Snake 0 secures A4 (6, 6) at T=3, I will pivot away from the X=6 column and aim for A5 (3, 8). I need 3 more LEFT moves to get A5 (3, 8). My move for T=3 will likely be LEFT (6, 8) $\\to$ (5, 8).",

Body: none.\n*   **Apples:** A1 (2, 5), A2 (6, 4), A3 (6, 3), A4 (6, 6), A5 (3, 8).\n\n**Review of Last Turn (Turn 3):**\n*   My move: DOWN from (6, 8) $\\to$ (6, 7). This puts me one move away from A4 (6, 6).\n*   Enemy Snake 0 moved from (3, 6) to (2, 6). This was a **LEFT** move.\n\n**Impact of Snake 0's Move (2, 6):**\nSnake 0 has prioritized the left side of the board.\n1. Apples A1 (2, 5): Manhattan Distance $|2-2| + |6-5| = 1$. Path: DOWN. **Reaches on T=5.**\n2. Apples A5 (3, 8): Manhattan Distance $|2-3| + |6-8| = 1 + 2 = 3$. Path: R, U, U. **Reaches on T=7.**\n3. Apples A4 (6, 6): Manhattan Distance $|2-6| + |6-6| = 4$. Path: R, R, R, R. **Reaches on T=8.**\n\nSnake 0 is now guaranteed to collect A1 (2, 5) on Turn 5 if they move DOWN.\n\n**My Snake 1 Target Analysis (6, 7):**\nMy goal remains A4 (6, 6).\n1. A4 (6, 6): Man. Dist: 1. Path: DOWN. **Reaches on T=5.**\n2. A2 (6, 4): Man. Dist: 3. Path: D, D, D. **Reaches on T=7.**\n3. A3 (6, 3): Man. Dist: 4.\n\n**Collision/Race Evaluation (Turn 4):**\nWe are both one move away from our priority targets:\n*   Me: (6, 7) $\\to$ (6, 6) [A4]\n*   Snake 0: (2, 6) $\\to$ (2, 5) [A1]\n\nSince our paths are widely separated (X=6 vs X=2), there is no collision risk. We will both collect an apple on T=5.\n\n**Safe Moves Check for Snake 1 (6, 7):**\n1. **DOWN (6, 6):** Safe. Moves toward apple A4. This is the optimal move.\n2. **UP (6, 8):** Safe, but moves away from all apples.\n3. **LEFT (5, 7):** Safe, but slows down progress toward A4.\n4. **RIGHT (7, 7):** Safe, but slows down progress toward A4.\n\n**The Decision:**\nI must move DOWN to position myself to eat A4 next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=5 onwards):**\n1. **T=5:** Move DOWN to (6, 6). Collect A4. My body will be at (6, 7). Snake 0 moves DOWN to (2, 5) and collects A1.\n2. **T=6:** At (6, 6). Next target is A2 (6, 4), which is 2 moves away. Move DOWN to (6, 5).\n3. **T=7:** Move DOWN to (6, 4). Collect A2.\n4. **T=8:** At (6, 4). Target A3 (6, 3). Move DOWN to (6, 3). Collect A3.\n\nThis strategy secures three apples (A4, A2, A3) immediately on the high-density side of the board, potentially reaching 3 apples before Snake 0 reaches their second apple (if they pivot back to A5 or cross the board). We are executing the planned sequence perfectly.\n\nDOWN",

Apples: 2.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T=8 onwards):**\nIf the above execution occurs:\n*   My Head: (6, 3).\n*   Snake 0 Head: (4, 4).\n*   Apples remaining: A2 (3, 8), A4 (1, 5), A5 (8, 6).\n\nThe next closest apple for me is A5 (8, 6). Manhattan Distance: $|6-8| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5$.\nThe next closest apple for Snake 0 is A4 (1, 5). Manhattan Distance: $|4-1| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4$. Or A2 (3, 8). Man. Dist: $|4-3| + |4-8| = 1 + 4 = 5$.\n\nSnake 0 will likely go for A4 (1, 5) or A2 (3, 8). A4 (1, 5) is slightly closer in terms of Manhattan distance, but potentially requires navigating around its own body/past the center. A2 (3, 8) is a straightforward push UP.\n\n**T=8 Plan:** At (6, 3). Target A5 (8, 6). Snake 0 will likely be moving west or north-west. I will head east/north-east.\nMove UP to (6, 4)? No, wait, that is body *after* T=7.\nI will be at (6, 3). Body: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)].\nTo reach (8, 6), I need to move RIGHT and UP.\nMove RIGHT to (7, 3).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\n**Turn 8 / 150**\nCurrent head: (6, 3). Next target: A5 (8, 6). Move RIGHT to (7, 3). (Man. Dist to A5: 4)\n**Turn 9 / 150**\nCurrent head: (7, 3). Move UP to (7, 4). (Man. Dist to A5: 3. Body: [(7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4)].)\n**Turn 10 / 150**\nCurrent head: (7, 4). Move UP to (7, 5). (Man. Dist to A5: 2.)\n**Turn 11 / 150**\nCurrent head: (7, 5). Move RIGHT to (8, 5). (Man. Dist to A5: 1.)\n**Turn 12 / 150**\nCurrent head: (8, 5). Move UP to (8, 6) and collect A5.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nDOWN",
