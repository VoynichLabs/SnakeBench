That seems safe for now.\n- Moving RIGHT would go towards the apple at (8, 3), but that\u2019s far, and moving directly right would be detrimental because of potential collisions or being outside the immediate safe zone.\n- Moving UP or DOWN might help navigate towards nearby apples, but currently, the closest apple is at (5, 3) or (8, 3). \n\nPotential dangers:\n- Moving UP from (1, 5) to (1, 6) is safe initially, but we need a plan to get to the apples.\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 4) seems reasonable; it's a safe move in the short term.\n\nGiven the current configuration, a cautious move would be to go LEFT to (0, 5)\u2014a safe position, avoiding immediate threats and giving flexibility to move towards other apples later.\n\nNext move:\n- Moving LEFT seems safest and allows potential movement strategies to approach apples.\n\nTherefore, my decision is:\n\n**LEFT**",
