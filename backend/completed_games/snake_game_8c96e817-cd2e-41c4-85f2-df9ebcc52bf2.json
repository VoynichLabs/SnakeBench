RIGHT: From (5, 8) to (6, 8) - This is valid:\n   - Not off the board\n   - Not into my own body\n   - Not into enemy snake's body\n   - No head-on collision risk\n\nAll four moves are safe. Now I need to decide which one is best strategically.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0, 3) - far away\n- (1, 4) - far away\n- (7, 9) - far away\n- (7, 0) - far away\n- (5, 1) - relatively close, just 7 units down\n\nI should move towards the apple at (5, 1). That means I should move DOWN to (5, 7).\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations:\n- The enemy snake is at (0, 1) and seems to be moving around the bottom left area\n- I'm currently in the middle-right area of the board\n- Moving DOWN keeps me moving towards the apple at (5, 1)\n\nI think DOWN is the best choice as it moves me closer to the apple at (5, 1) while keeping me safe.<|begin_of_box|>DOWN<|end_of_box|>",

UP: Moving to (4, 8) - This is safe as it's within bounds and not into any snake body. It moves me toward the apple at (3, 8).\n\n2. DOWN: Moving to (4, 6) - This is safe and moves me toward the apple at (1, 4).\n\n3. LEFT: Moving to (3, 7) - This is safe and moves me toward the apple at (3, 8).\n\n4. RIGHT: Moving to (5, 7) - This would move into my own body segment (5, 7), which would kill me. Not safe.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake's possible moves:\n- It can move UP to (1, 4), DOWN to (1, 2), or RIGHT to (2, 3)\n- None of these moves directly threaten my current position\n\nI should move UP to (4, 8) as it:\n- Moves me toward the apple at (3, 8)\n- Keeps my options open for future moves\n- Avoids any immediate danger\n- Positions me well for potential apple collection\n\nUP<|end_of_box|>\nUP\n<|begin_of_box|>I'm moving UP to (4, 8) to position myself closer to the apple at (3, 8). This move keeps me safe while advancing toward a reachable apple. I'll continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements and position myself strategically to collect apples while maintaining safety. My next goal is to reach the apple at (3, 8) and then consider positioning for the apple at (7, 9) which is in the top right corner. I should maintain flexibility in my movement to avoid getting trapped and to be able to react to the enemy snake's potential moves.<|end_of_box|>",
