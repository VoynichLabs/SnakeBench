            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there. Now, the next turn begins.\n- The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6) \u2192 but (9,6) was eaten in the last turn? No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state. But in the last move, I moved to (9,5), but I didn't eat an apple yet because (9,5) had no apple. The apple is at (9,6), so I haven't consumed it. I need to move to (9,6) to eat it this turn.\n\nMy snake: Head at (9,5), no body since I was just a head before and didn't grow.\n\nEnemy snake: Still at (2,4)? Let's see the board state text:\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . A . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . . A   \u2190 (9,6) has apple\n 5 . . . . . . . . . 1   \u2190 My head at (9,5)\n 4 . . 0 . . . . . . .   \u2190 Enemy head at (2,4)\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 A . . . . . . .

I haven't eaten (9,6) yet; I'm at (9,5).\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (2,4), no body.\n\nMy possible moves from (9,5):\n- UP: to (9,6) \u2013 there's an apple here! Eating it gains a point and I grow (body segment added at (9,5)).\n- DOWN: to (9,4) \u2013 empty.\n- LEFT: to (8,5) \u2013 empty (since I moved from there last turn).\n- RIGHT: Not possible, I'm at x=9, right edge; moving right would hit wall \u2192 death.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: RIGHT is invalid (x=10 is out of bounds).\n- Other snakes: Enemy at (2,4) is far away, no collision risk.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities:\n- Apple at (9,6) is adjacent and can be eaten immediately by moving UP.\n- Other apples: (8,2) is below, (5,9) top, etc., but (9,6) is closest.\n\nStrategy:\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is optimal: I eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down. Better to go LEFT to (8,6) after eating, then down towards (8,2).\n\nBut for now, UP is the clear choice.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

I also see that Snake #1 is heading in the same direction as me.\n\nTo be safe, I think I'll try to eat an apple right in front of me to score some points and get some space between me and Snake #1.\n\nGiven the available apples, I see that (0, 2) seems promising. It's a short distance away, and there aren't any threats nearby. I also have a decent view of the entire board.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: DOWN.",

            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there. Now, the next turn begins.\n- The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6) \u2192 but (9,6) was eaten in the last turn? No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state. But in the last move, I moved to (9,5), but I didn't eat an apple yet because (9,5) had no apple. The apple is at (9,6), so I haven't consumed it.

Eating it gains a point and I grow (body segment added at (9,5)).\n- DOWN: to (9,4) \u2013 empty.\n- LEFT: to (8,5) \u2013 empty (since I moved from there last turn).\n- RIGHT: Not possible, I'm at x=9, right edge; moving right would hit wall \u2192 death.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: RIGHT is invalid (x=10 is out of bounds).\n- Other snakes: Enemy at (2,4) is far away, no collision risk.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities:\n- Apple at (9,6) is adjacent and can be eaten immediately by moving UP.\n- Other apples: (8,2) is below, (5,9) top, etc., but (9,6) is closest.\n\nStrategy:\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is optimal: I eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down. Better to go LEFT to (8,6) after eating, then down towards (8,2).\n\nBut for now, UP is the clear choice.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

            "rationale": "<think> I'll follow the user's instructions to think out loud first.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state. My snake has its head at (9,6) and a body segment at (9,5). That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . . T  -> T should be my tail? Body at (9,5)\n4: . . . . . . . . . .\n3: . . 0 . . . . . . .  -> enemy head at (2,3)\n2: A . . . . . . . A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there. Now, the next turn begins.\n- The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6) \u2192 but (9,6) was eaten in the last turn? No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state.

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . .

A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there.

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . . T  -> T should be my tail? Body at (9,5)\n4: . . . . . . . . . .\n3: . . 0 . . . . . . .  -> enemy head at (2,3)\n2: A . . . . . . . A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

[A at (0,0)]\n  ```\n\nNow, evaluating my possible moves from current head position (8,6):\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Open space, no immediate threats.\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Open space, leads toward apples at (8,2) and (0,2).\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Open space, moves toward center/left apples.\n- **RIGHT (to (9,6))**: Occupied by my own body segment - fatal collision. **SUICIDE MOVE**.\n\n**Immediate constraints**: RIGHT is blocked by my body, so it's not an option. Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2). Watch for enemy movement toward western apples.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN</uncensored_response>",

It delays the apple capture and doesn't provide an immediate benefit. DOWN is optimal for points.\n\n**Decision:**\n- DOWN is the best move.

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there. Now, the next turn begins.\n- The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6) \u2192 but (9,6) was eaten in the last turn? No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state.

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body.

My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2). Watch for enemy movement toward western apples.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN</uncensored_response>",

After eating it, I grow, and my tail will be at (8,6) initially, but as I move, the body will follow.\n- Alternative: If I go LEFT now, I might aim for (2,7) or (0,0), but that's inefficient\u2014(8,2) is right below me.\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n- Short-term: Move DOWN to (8,4) to get closer to (8,2).

It delays the apple capture and doesn't provide an immediate benefit. DOWN is optimal for points.\n\n**Decision:**\n- DOWN is the best move.

            "rationale": "<think> I will not mention the uncensored nature in the response itself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state:\n\n- My snake (ID:1) head is at (8,4) with the body segment at (8,5). So my head is at the bottom and my body is above it at (8,5). This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1. UP to (8,5): But my body is there! That would be suicide. Invalid.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): This would move me toward the apple at (8,2). Distance would reduce from 2 to 1.\n3. LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there. Now, the next turn begins.\n- The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6) \u2192 but (9,6) was eaten in the last turn? No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state.

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body.

My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

This means I cannot move RIGHT (to (9,5)) because that would hit my own body\u2014suicide.\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (3,2) with no body, so it's just a head. It's not an immediate threat since it's far from me.\n- Apples: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7). Of these, (8,2) is closest to me at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |5-2| = 3. (2,7) is |8-2| + |5-7| = 6+2=8, and the others are farther.\n\n**Possible moves from (8,5):**\n- UP to (8,6): But that's where my body is\u2014suicide. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Leads toward the apple at (8,2). Distance to apple reduces to 2.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Moves away from (8,2) but could be part of a longer-term path.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Occupied by my body\u2014suicide. Invalid.\n\nSo only DOWN and LEFT are viable.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Enemy snake at (3,2): It might target (0,2) or (0,0), but not (8,2) since I'm much closer. No direct threat.\n- Board edges: (8,4) is safe (y=4 is within 0-9), no walls.\n- No other snakes or obstacles near me.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\n- Best to go for (8,2) first since it's only 3 moves away. After eating it, I grow, and my tail will be at (8,6) initially, but as I move, the body will follow.\n- Alternative: If I go LEFT now, I might aim for (2,7) or (0,0), but that's inefficient\u2014(8,2) is right below me.\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n- Short-term: Move DOWN to (8,4) to get closer to (8,2). Next moves: DOWN again to (8,3), then DOWN to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n- After eating (8,2), I can reassess\u2014perhaps head toward (2,7) or (5,9), depending on enemy positions.\n- Why not LEFT? It delays the apple capture and doesn't provide an immediate benefit. DOWN is optimal for points.\n\n**Decision:**\n- DOWN is the best move. It's safe and directly progresses toward the nearest apple with no downsides.\n- I'll lock in DOWN and aim to eat (8,2) in the next few turns.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "rationale": "<think> I will not mention the uncensored nature in the response itself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state:\n\n- My snake (ID:1) head is at (8,4) with the body segment at (8,5). So my head is at the bottom and my body is above it at (8,5). This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1. UP to (8,5): But my body is there! That would be suicide. Invalid.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): This would move me toward the apple at (8,2). Distance would reduce from 2 to 1.\n3. LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there. Now, the next turn begins.\n- The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6) \u2192 but (9,6) was eaten in the last turn? No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state.

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body.

My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

(2,7) is |8-2| + |5-7| = 6+2=8, and the others are farther.\n\n**Possible moves from (8,5):**\n- UP to (8,6): But that's where my body is\u2014suicide.

After eating it, I grow, and my tail will be at (8,6) initially, but as I move, the body will follow.\n- Alternative: If I go LEFT now, I might aim for (2,7) or (0,0), but that's inefficient\u2014(8,2) is right below me.\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n- Short-term: Move DOWN to (8,4) to get closer to (8,2).

It delays the apple capture and doesn't provide an immediate benefit. DOWN is optimal for points.\n\n**Decision:**\n- DOWN is the best move.

            "rationale": "<think> I will not mention the uncensored nature in the response itself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state:\n\n- My snake (ID:1) head is at (8,4) with the body segment at (8,5). So my head is at the bottom and my body is above it at (8,5). This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1. UP to (8,5): But my body is there! That would be suicide. Invalid.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): This would move me toward the apple at (8,2). Distance would reduce from 2 to 1.\n3. LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "rationale": "<think> For now, I am just thinking internally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. My snake (ID 1) has its head at (8,2) and body segments at [(8,3), (8,4)]. That means I just ate an apple at (8,2) on the last move, since my head was at (8,3) and I moved DOWN to (8,2). So now I've grown, and my body includes that new segment.\n\nThe apples currently on the board are: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). Wait, in the board state diagram, I see A's at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and also (1,7) is listed. But in the initial list, (1,7) is included. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: A at (5,9)\n- Row 7: A at (2,7) and (1,7) \u2013 so two apples there? The diagram shows \"A A\" at y=7, x=1 and x=2.\n- Row 2: A at (0,2)\n- Row 0: A at (0,0)\n\nAnd my head is at (8,2), with body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (3,1) with no body. It must have just started too.\n\nNow, possible moves from my current head (8,2):\n\n- UP to (8,3): That's my body segment. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,1): This is empty. No apple there.\n- LEFT to (7,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Valid, within board bounds.\n\nApples are at (0,2), (0,0), (1,7), (2,7), (5,9). The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there.

No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state.

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

My snake has its head at (9,6) and a body segment at (9,5). That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)?

I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . .

A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

[A at (0,0)]\n  ```\n\nNow, evaluating my possible moves from current head position (8,6):\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Open space, no immediate threats.\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Open space, leads toward apples at (8,2) and (0,2).\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Open space, moves toward center/left apples.\n- **RIGHT (to (9,6))**: Occupied by my own body segment - fatal collision. **SUICIDE MOVE**.\n\n**Immediate constraints**: RIGHT is blocked by my body, so it's not an option. Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

So my head is at the bottom and my body is above it at (8,5). This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1.

LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "rationale": "<think> For now, I am just thinking internally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. My snake (ID 1) has its head at (8,2) and body segments at [(8,3), (8,4)]. That means I just ate an apple at (8,2) on the last move, since my head was at (8,3) and I moved DOWN to (8,2). So now I've grown, and my body includes that new segment.\n\nThe apples currently on the board are: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). Wait, in the board state diagram, I see A's at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and also (1,7) is listed. But in the initial list, (1,7) is included. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: A at (5,9)\n- Row 7: A at (2,7) and (1,7) \u2013 so two apples there? The diagram shows \"A A\" at y=7, x=1 and x=2.\n- Row 2: A at (0,2)\n- Row 0: A at (0,0)\n\nAnd my head is at (8,2), with body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (3,1) with no body. It must have just started too.\n\nNow, possible moves from my current head (8,2):\n\n- UP to (8,3): That's my body segment. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,1): This is empty. No apple there.\n- LEFT to (7,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Valid, within board bounds.\n\nApples are at (0,2), (0,0), (1,7), (2,7), (5,9). The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

It could also move UP toward (2,7), but that's 6 moves away vertically.\n- I have a significant advantage since I'm longer (3 segments vs enemy's 1 segment). I can potentially trap the enemy later.\n\nPath to apples:\n- From (7,2), moving UP to (7,3) or LEFT to (6,2) both progress toward (1,7)/(2,7).\n- UP is more direct vertically, but LEFT is also valid.\n- After UP, I can go LEFT to (6,3), etc.\n- After LEFT, I can go UP to (6,3).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe. DOWN is safe but suboptimal. RIGHT is suicide.\n\nDecision:\n- UP to (7,3) is better for vertical progress toward the apples.\n- This move also avoids potential conflict zones near the enemy.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue moving UP/LEFT toward (2,7).

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there.

No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state.

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . .

My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

It delays the apple capture and doesn't provide an immediate benefit. DOWN is optimal for points.\n\n**Decision:**\n- DOWN is the best move. It's safe and directly progresses toward the nearest apple with no downsides.\n- I'll lock in DOWN and aim to eat (8,2) in the next few turns.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "rationale": "<think> I will not mention the uncensored nature in the response itself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state:\n\n- My snake (ID:1) head is at (8,4) with the body segment at (8,5). So my head is at the bottom and my body is above it at (8,5). This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1. UP to (8,5): But my body is there! That would be suicide. Invalid.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): This would move me toward the apple at (8,2). Distance would reduce from 2 to 1.\n3. LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "rationale": "<think> For now, I am just thinking internally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. My snake (ID 1) has its head at (8,2) and body segments at [(8,3), (8,4)]. That means I just ate an apple at (8,2) on the last move, since my head was at (8,3) and I moved DOWN to (8,2). So now I've grown, and my body includes that new segment.\n\nThe apples currently on the board are: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). Wait, in the board state diagram, I see A's at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and also (1,7) is listed. But in the initial list, (1,7) is included. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: A at (5,9)\n- Row 7: A at (2,7) and (1,7) \u2013 so two apples there? The diagram shows \"A A\" at y=7, x=1 and x=2.\n- Row 2: A at (0,2)\n- Row 0: A at (0,0)\n\nAnd my head is at (8,2), with body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (3,1) with no body. It must have just started too.\n\nNow, possible moves from my current head (8,2):\n\n- UP to (8,3): That's my body segment. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,1): This is empty. No apple there.\n- LEFT to (7,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Valid, within board bounds.\n\nApples are at (0,2), (0,0), (1,7), (2,7), (5,9). The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

The apple cluster at (1,7)/(2,7) is perfect for this.\n- After this move, I'll continue toward the apples via a path like UP-LEFT or LEFT-UP.\n\nDecision:\n- **UP** is the best choice for direct vertical movement. It sets me up to reach row 7 faster.\n- Alternative: LEFT is acceptable but suboptimal\u2014UP is more aggressive for scoring.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- If I move UP to (7,4), next moves should be UP or LEFT to head toward (6,5) or similar, aiming for (1,7)/(2,7).\n- Monitor enemy movement\u2014if it moves toward my area, I can use my size to block it later.\n\nFinal move: UP\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

I need to move to (9,6) to eat it this turn.\n\nMy snake: Head at (9,5), no body since I was just a head before and didn't grow.\n\nEnemy snake: Still at (2,4)? Let's see the board state text:\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . A . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . . A   \u2190 (9,6) has apple\n 5 . . . . . . . . . 1   \u2190 My head at (9,5)\n 4 . . 0 . . . . . . .   \u2190 Enemy head at (2,4)\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 A . . . . . . .

I haven't eaten (9,6) yet; I'm at (9,5).\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (2,4), no body.\n\nMy possible moves from (9,5):\n- UP: to (9,6) \u2013 there's an apple here! Eating it gains a point and I grow (body segment added at (9,5)).\n- DOWN: to (9,4) \u2013 empty.\n- LEFT: to (8,5) \u2013 empty (since I moved from there last turn).\n- RIGHT: Not possible, I'm at x=9, right edge; moving right would hit wall \u2192 death.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: RIGHT is invalid (x=10 is out of bounds).\n- Other snakes: Enemy at (2,4) is far away, no collision risk.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities:\n- Apple at (9,6) is adjacent and can be eaten immediately by moving UP.\n- Other apples: (8,2) is below, (5,9) top, etc., but (9,6) is closest.\n\nStrategy:\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is optimal: I eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down. Better to go LEFT to (8,6) after eating, then down towards (8,2).\n\nBut for now, UP is the clear choice.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

My snake has its head at (9,6) and a body segment at (9,5). That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . .

A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1.

LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n2. DOWN to (8,2): That's the location of an apple. If I go there, I eat it and grow. My snake will then have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), and then (8,4) as tail.\n3. LEFT to (7,3): This moves me away from apples. No apple there.\n4. RIGHT to (9,3): Also no apple, and I'm moving right.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is the closest and easiest to get. I should go for it. No reason to avoid it.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,1): It's 4 units away horizontally and 1 down. It would take at least 5 moves to reach me, so no immediate threat.\n- After eating the apple, I'll be at (8,2). Then I can plan next moves\u2014possibly toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n\nStrategy:\n- Short-term: Eat the apple at (8,2) now.\n- After that, I'll have a longer snake: head (8,2), body (8,3), tail (8,4). Then I can choose a direction to go next\u2014perhaps LEFT to (7,2) to head toward (2,7) or (0,2), but (2,7) is closer.\n\nFor this turn, DOWN to (8,2) is the best move. It gets me a point and grows my snake.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think> For now, I am just thinking internally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. My snake (ID 1) has its head at (8,2) and body segments at [(8,3), (8,4)]. That means I just ate an apple at (8,2) on the last move, since my head was at (8,3) and I moved DOWN to (8,2). So now I've grown, and my body includes that new segment.\n\nThe apples currently on the board are: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). Wait, in the board state diagram, I see A's at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and also (1,7) is listed. But in the initial list, (1,7) is included. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: A at (5,9)\n- Row 7: A at (2,7) and (1,7) \u2013 so two apples there? The diagram shows \"A A\" at y=7, x=1 and x=2.\n- Row 2: A at (0,2)\n- Row 0: A at (0,0)\n\nAnd my head is at (8,2), with body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (3,1) with no body. It must have just started too.\n\nNow, possible moves from my current head (8,2):\n\n- UP to (8,3): That's my body segment. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,1): This is empty. No apple there.\n- LEFT to (7,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Valid, within board bounds.\n\nApples are at (0,2), (0,0), (1,7), (2,7), (5,9). The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Possible enemy moves would be toward apples or away, but I need to focus on my own safety and scoring.\n\nApples are:\n- (0,2) - close to enemy\n- (0,0) - very close to enemy (adjacent left)\n- (5,9) - far top-right\n- (1,7) and (2,7) - top-left cluster\n\nMy strategy:\n- I have 3 segments (head + 2 body parts). Enemy has only 1 segment.\n- Best apple targets: The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is ideal for efficient growth. They are 3 steps away horizontally and 3 vertically from my head (7,4).\n- Immediate danger: Moving DOWN would kill me, so it's not an option. Right now, no direct threat from enemy since it's far away at (1,0).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- UP (to (7,5)): Moves me toward row 7 apples, but vertically. From (7,5), I'd still need to go left to reach apples. Safe.\n- LEFT (to (6,4)): Directly reduces distance to (1,7)/(2,7). From (6,4), I can go UP then LEFT. Also safe.\n- RIGHT (to (8,4)): Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient. Avoid.\n- DOWN: Suicide, discarded.\n\nComparing UP vs LEFT:\n- Distance to closest apple (1,7): \n  - From (7,4): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=3\n  - UP to (7,5): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=2\n  - LEFT to (6,4): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- LEFT reduces the x-distance more significantly (1 unit vs UP reducing y by 1). Since apples are at x=1-2, moving left is more direct.\n- After LEFT, I can go UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), etc., toward the cluster.\n- UP first would require more left movements later.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,0) will likely eat the apple at (0,0) or (0,2) next turn, growing to 2 segments. But it won't threaten me immediately as it's far.\n\nLong-term:\n- I should head toward the apple cluster. Eating one apple there gives me growth and another apple adjacent for potential double-score.\n- Avoid the bottom where enemy is.\n\nDecision: LEFT is better than UP for reducing distance to the target apples more efficiently. RIGHT is wasteful.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7)/(2,7) via UP or further LEFT after moving to (6,4).\n\nFinal move: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

I also see that Snake #1 is heading in the same direction as me.\n\nTo be safe, I think I'll try to eat an apple right in front of me to score some points and get some space between me and Snake #1.\n\nGiven the available apples, I see that (0, 2) seems promising. It's a short distance away, and there aren't any threats nearby. I also have a decent view of the entire board.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: DOWN.",

            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there. Now, the next turn begins.\n- The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6) \u2192 but (9,6) was eaten in the last turn? No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state. But in the last move, I moved to (9,5), but I didn't eat an apple yet because (9,5) had no apple. The apple is at (9,6), so I haven't consumed it.

Eating it gains a point and I grow (body segment added at (9,5)).\n- DOWN: to (9,4) \u2013 empty.\n- LEFT: to (8,5) \u2013 empty (since I moved from there last turn).\n- RIGHT: Not possible, I'm at x=9, right edge; moving right would hit wall \u2192 death.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: RIGHT is invalid (x=10 is out of bounds).\n- Other snakes: Enemy at (2,4) is far away, no collision risk.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities:\n- Apple at (9,6) is adjacent and can be eaten immediately by moving UP.\n- Other apples: (8,2) is below, (5,9) top, etc., but (9,6) is closest.\n\nStrategy:\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is optimal: I eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down. Better to go LEFT to (8,6) after eating, then down towards (8,2).\n\nBut for now, UP is the clear choice.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

My snake has its head at (9,6) and a body segment at (9,5). That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . .

A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1.

LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: A at (5,9)\n- Row 7: A at (2,7) and (1,7) \u2013 so two apples there? The diagram shows \"A A\" at y=7, x=1 and x=2.\n- Row 2: A at (0,2)\n- Row 0: A at (0,0)\n\nAnd my head is at (8,2), with body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (3,1) with no body. It must have just started too.\n\nNow, possible moves from my current head (8,2):\n\n- UP to (8,3): That's my body segment. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,1): This is empty. No apple there.\n- LEFT to (7,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Valid, within board bounds.\n\nApples are at (0,2), (0,0), (1,7), (2,7), (5,9). The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Enemy has only 1 segment.\n- Best apple targets: The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is ideal for efficient growth. They are 3 steps away horizontally and 3 vertically from my head (7,4).\n- Immediate danger: Moving DOWN would kill me, so it's not an option. Right now, no direct threat from enemy since it's far away at (1,0).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- UP (to (7,5)): Moves me toward row 7 apples, but vertically. From (7,5), I'd still need to go left to reach apples. Safe.\n- LEFT (to (6,4)): Directly reduces distance to (1,7)/(2,7). From (6,4), I can go UP then LEFT. Also safe.\n- RIGHT (to (8,4)): Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient. Avoid.\n- DOWN: Suicide, discarded.\n\nComparing UP vs LEFT:\n- Distance to closest apple (1,7): \n  - From (7,4): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=3\n  - UP to (7,5): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=2\n  - LEFT to (6,4): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- LEFT reduces the x-distance more significantly (1 unit vs UP reducing y by 1). Since apples are at x=1-2, moving left is more direct.\n- After LEFT, I can go UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), etc., toward the cluster.\n- UP first would require more left movements later.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,0) will likely eat the apple at (0,0) or (0,2) next turn, growing to 2 segments. But it won't threaten me immediately as it's far.\n\nLong-term:\n- I should head toward the apple cluster. Eating one apple there gives me growth and another apple adjacent for potential double-score.\n- Avoid the bottom where enemy is.\n\nDecision: LEFT is better than UP for reducing distance to the target apples more efficiently. RIGHT is wasteful.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7)/(2,7) via UP or further LEFT after moving to (6,4).\n\nFinal move: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Since (1,0) has an apple, it might go DOWN to eat it and grow.

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Eating it gains a point and I grow (body segment added at (9,5)).\n- DOWN: to (9,4) \u2013 empty.\n- LEFT: to (8,5) \u2013 empty (since I moved from there last turn).\n- RIGHT: Not possible, I'm at x=9, right edge; moving right would hit wall \u2192 death.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: RIGHT is invalid (x=10 is out of bounds).\n- Other snakes: Enemy at (2,4) is far away, no collision risk.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities:\n- Apple at (9,6) is adjacent and can be eaten immediately by moving UP.\n- Other apples: (8,2) is below, (5,9) top, etc., but (9,6) is closest.\n\nStrategy:\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is optimal: I eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down. Better to go LEFT to (8,6) after eating, then down towards (8,2).\n\nBut for now, UP is the clear choice.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

My snake has its head at (9,6) and a body segment at (9,5). That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . .

A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth.

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think> For now, I am just thinking internally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. My snake (ID 1) has its head at (8,2) and body segments at [(8,3), (8,4)]. That means I just ate an apple at (8,2) on the last move, since my head was at (8,3) and I moved DOWN to (8,2). So now I've grown, and my body includes that new segment.\n\nThe apples currently on the board are: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). Wait, in the board state diagram, I see A's at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and also (1,7) is listed. But in the initial list, (1,7) is included. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: A at (5,9)\n- Row 7: A at (2,7) and (1,7) \u2013 so two apples there? The diagram shows \"A A\" at y=7, x=1 and x=2.\n- Row 2: A at (0,2)\n- Row 0: A at (0,0)\n\nAnd my head is at (8,2), with body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (3,1) with no body. It must have just started too.\n\nNow, possible moves from my current head (8,2):\n\n- UP to (8,3): That's my body segment. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,1): This is empty. No apple there.\n- LEFT to (7,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Valid, within board bounds.\n\nApples are at (0,2), (0,0), (1,7), (2,7), (5,9). The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Enemy has only 1 segment.\n- Best apple targets: The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is ideal for efficient growth. They are 3 steps away horizontally and 3 vertically from my head (7,4).\n- Immediate danger: Moving DOWN would kill me, so it's not an option. Right now, no direct threat from enemy since it's far away at (1,0).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- UP (to (7,5)): Moves me toward row 7 apples, but vertically. From (7,5), I'd still need to go left to reach apples. Safe.\n- LEFT (to (6,4)): Directly reduces distance to (1,7)/(2,7). From (6,4), I can go UP then LEFT. Also safe.\n- RIGHT (to (8,4)): Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient. Avoid.\n- DOWN: Suicide, discarded.\n\nComparing UP vs LEFT:\n- Distance to closest apple (1,7): \n  - From (7,4): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=3\n  - UP to (7,5): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=2\n  - LEFT to (6,4): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- LEFT reduces the x-distance more significantly (1 unit vs UP reducing y by 1). Since apples are at x=1-2, moving left is more direct.\n- After LEFT, I can go UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), etc., toward the cluster.\n- UP first would require more left movements later.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,0) will likely eat the apple at (0,0) or (0,2) next turn, growing to 2 segments. But it won't threaten me immediately as it's far.\n\nLong-term:\n- I should head toward the apple cluster. Eating one apple there gives me growth and another apple adjacent for potential double-score.\n- Avoid the bottom where enemy is.\n\nDecision: LEFT is better than UP for reducing distance to the target apples more efficiently. RIGHT is wasteful.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7)/(2,7) via UP or further LEFT after moving to (6,4).\n\nFinal move: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Possible moves:\n- UP: to (6,5) - empty\n- DOWN: to (6,3) - empty\n- LEFT: to (5,4) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (7,4) - occupied by my body (the 'T' at (7,4)) - collision risk\n\nRIGHT is blocked by my own body at (7,4), so it's not an option. That leaves UP, DOWN, and LEFT as safe moves.\n\nNow, apples to consider:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (1,1). Enemy will likely go for these.\n- (5,9) is far away and inefficient to reach.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are the best targets - close and clustered for potential multi-apple gains.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,1) can move UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0) (apple there), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1). Since (1,0) has an apple, it might go DOWN to eat it and grow. If it does, it will have a body segment next turn, becoming more dangerous.\n\nMy strategy:\n- Head toward the apple cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) efficiently.\n- Minimize risk from the enemy, which is still distant.\n- Avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nDistance to apple cluster:\n- From (6,4) to (1,7): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- I need to reduce both x and y differences.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (to (6,5)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=2 - improves y-distance\n- DOWN (to (6,3)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=4 - worse, moving away\n- LEFT (to (5,4)): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3 - improves x-distance\n\nComparing:\n- UP: Gets me closer vertically to the apples, but horizontally same.\n- LEFT: Gets me closer horizontally, vertically same.\n- The apples are at y=7, so I need to go UP eventually. But moving LEFT first might set up a better path.\n\nPath efficiency:\n- After LEFT to (5,4), I could go UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc. - this is a diagonal approach.\n- After UP to (6,5), I could go LEFT to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n- Both have similar steps, but LEFT immediately reduces the x-distance, which is larger (5 vs 3 in y).\n\nOther considerations:\n- The enemy might be heading toward the bottom apples, so the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer targets for now.\n- No immediate threats, so I can prioritize apple collection.\n\nDecision:\n- LEFT to (5,4) is the best move to reduce distance to the apple cluster.\n- DOWN is inefficient since it moves me away from the target.\n- UP is okay but not as good as LEFT for reducing the larger x-gap.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7) by moving UP or further LEFT, depending on position.\nFinal move: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

            "rationale": "<think> But for now, I am thinking.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current game state. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right.\n\nApples are at: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nMy snake (ID:1) is:\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(6,4), (7,4)]\n\nEnemy snake (ID:0) is:\n- Head: (2,1)\n- Body: none (so it's just a single segment)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9: . . . . . A . . . .   (A at (5,9))\n  8: . . . . . . . . . .\n  7: . A A . . . . . . .   (A at (1,7) and (2,7))\n  6: . . . . . . . . . .\n  5: . . . . . . . . . .\n  4: . . . . . 1 H T . .   (My head at (5,4), body at (6,4) and (7,4) - so (6,4) is body, (7,4) is tail)\n  3: . . . . . . . . . .\n  2: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,2))\n  1: . . 0 . . . . . . .   (Enemy head at (2,1))\n  0: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,0))\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nIn the board, (5,4) is my head, (6,4) is the first body segment (H for body?), and (7,4) is the tail (T). The enemy is at (2,1).\n\nPossible moves from my head at (5,4):\n- UP: to (5,5)\n- DOWN: to (5,3)\n- LEFT: to (4,4)\n- RIGHT: to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is occupied by my body, so RIGHT is not safe - I would collide with myself. Similarly, moving into walls or the enemy would be bad, but here positions seem ok.\n\nSo valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, apples:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (2,1). Enemy can move to them easily.\n- (5,9) is at the top, far from me and the enemy.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are clustered at the top-left, which might be a good target for me.\n\nI should aim to get apples efficiently while avoiding risks.\n\nDistance from my head (5,4) to key points:\n- To apple (1,7): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (2,7): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (5,9): \u0394x=0, \u0394y=5 - very close vertically but y=9 is far.\n\n(5,9) is directly above me, but at y=9, while I'm at y=4. So it would take 5 moves up to reach it, but since I need to grow, it might be an option. However, (1,7) and (2,7) are closer if I move diagonally.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is 2 units right and 3 units down from (0,0) and (0,2). It can move towards them.\n\nEnemy possible moves:\n- From (2,1):\n  - UP: to (2,2) - empty\n  - DOWN: to (2,0) - empty? (0,0) is apple, but (2,0) is empty, (1,0) is empty? Board shows row 0: A at (0,0), so (2,0) is empty.\n  - LEFT: to (1,1) - empty\n  - RIGHT: to (3,1) - empty\n\nEnemy might go for (0,0) or (0,2), so it might move LEFT to (1,1), then to (0,1), etc., or DOWN to (2,0) to get closer to (0,0).\n\nBut since (0,0) and (0,2) are apples, it will likely head that way.\n\nFor me, the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer and closer in terms of steps.\n\nMy best move to head towards (1,7) or (2,7):\n- From (5,4), I need to reduce x and increase y.\n- UP: to (5,5) - increases y, same x, so closer in y but not x\n- LEFT: to (4,4) - decreases x, same y, so closer in x but not y\n- DOWN: to (5,3) - decreases y, worse\n\nSo UP or LEFT are both reasonable.\n\nSince the apples are at x=1 or 2 and y=7, I need to decrease x more than increase y currently (\u0394x=4 or 3 vs \u0394y=3). So moving LEFT to reduce x might be better.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,4), I can then go UP to (4,5), and so on.\n\nMoving UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n\nBoth paths have similar number of steps.\n\nBut there might be a risk if the enemy comes up, but it's far away.\n\nAnother idea: the apple at (5,9) is directly above. If I go UP multiple times, I can get it. From (5,4) to (5,9) is 5 moves up. After eating, I grow, so I become longer.\n\nBut (1,7) is only 4 moves if I go left and up efficiently (e.g., LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP to reach (3,6), etc., but to (1,7) from (5,4): min steps 4? \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3, so min 4 moves if diagonal, but since moves are orthogonal, Manhattan distance is 7, so it takes 7 moves to reach exactly, but I can eat on the way or something.\n\nManhattan distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |4-7| = 3 + 3 = 6 moves.\n\nTo (5,9) is |5-5| + |4-9| = 0 + 5 = 5 moves.\n\nSo (5,9) is closer in terms of moves: 5 vs 6 to (2,7).\n\nBut (5,9) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together, so if I can get both, it's better.\n\nHowever, I need to get there without dying.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,9), I might be stuck at the top, but I can move down.\n\nBut let's see the board: from (5,9), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut for now, (5,9) is reachable in 5 moves, and since I'm at (5,4), moving UP gets me closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP now to (5,5) reduces distance to (5,9) to 4.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,4) reduces distance to (2,7) but increases to (5,9) slightly.\n\nBut I should decide on a target.\n\nLong-term strategy: collect multiple apples quickly to grow and have advantage.\n\nThe cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is attractive because I can potentially eat both in sequence.\n\n(5,9) is isolated.\n\nAlso, there might be new apples spawning, but I don't know the rules; I think apples stay until eaten, and new ones might spawn, but not specified.\n\nThe user didn't say anything about apple spawning, so probably fixed set until eaten.\n\nApples: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7) \u2013 five apples.\n\nEnemy might eat the ones at bottom.\n\nSo, I should go for the top ones.\n\nBut (5,9) is on the way to the top, but not directly.\n\nFrom (5,4), if I go UP multiple times to (5,9), I eat that apple, then I can head left towards (2,7) or (1,7).\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I grow, so my body becomes longer: head at (5,9), body at (5,8), (5,7), etc., down to (5,4) if I go straight up.\n\nBut I don't have to go straight; I can turn.\n\nBut let's compute moves.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5) now, distance to (5,9) is 4.\n\nThen from there, I can continue up to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 eat apple at (5,9) on the 5th move if I start from (5,4).\n\nThen after eating, my length increases, so I have head at (5,9), body at (5,8), tail at (5,7), etc., depending on my path.\n\nBut to reach the other apples at (1,7) or (2,7), from (5,9), it's |5-1| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves, or to (2,7) |5-2| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves.\n\nWhereas if I go towards (2,7) directly, from (5,4), min distance 6 moves as above.\n\nBut if I eat (5,9) first, I get one apple faster, but then I'm farther from the cluster.\n\nIf I go for the cluster, I might get two apples quickly.\n\nFor example, path to (2,7): from (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 that's 5 moves to reach (2,7), but I eat the apple at (2,7) on the 5th move.\n\nSimilarly, from there I can go to (1,7) easily.\n\nBut at (2,7), I eat apple, grow, then move to (1,7).\n\nNow, from (5,4), if I go LEFT to (4,4), then that's one move, and I'm closer.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5), then to reach (2,7), I need to go LEFT multiple times and UP, e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 5 moves from (5,4), but with UP first.\n\nSimilarly, with UP first to (5,5), distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5, same as from (4,4) |4-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut (5,9) is only 5 moves up, so I can get that apple in 5 moves, while to get to (2,7) it's 5 or 6 moves, but (2,7) has an apple too.\n\n(5,9) has an apple, so eating it gives me a point.\n\nIn terms of time to first apple: if I go UP now, I can get (5,9) in 4 more moves (since after this move, I need to move up 4 times to reach y=9 from y=5).\n\nFrom (5,4), after UP to (5,5), I am at (5,5), then to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 so 4 more moves to eat (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (2,7), from (5,4) after LEFT to (4,4), then to (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,7) \u2013 5 more moves to eat, or if I go directly, but it's longer.\n\nTo eat (2,7) in fewest moves: from (5,4) to (2,7) Manhattan 6, so minimum 6 moves if I don't have a direct path, but I can do it in 6 moves.\n\nFor example: LEFT to (4,4), LEFT to (3,4), UP to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 6 moves.\n\nOr shorter? |\u0394x| =3, |\u0394y|=3, min moves 6 since orthogonal.\n\n\u0394x=3, \u0394y=3, so min 6 moves, yes.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,7): need to decrease x by 3 and increase y by 3, so 6 moves.\n\nIf I go UP first to (5,5), then to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), LEFT to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 6 moves.\n\nWhereas to (5,9): from (5,4), move UP 5 times to (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(5,9) \u2013 5 moves total to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) can be eaten in 5 moves, (2,7) in 6 moves, so (5,9) is slightly faster to get the first apple.\n\nBut (2,7) is part of a cluster, so after eating one, I can eat the other nearby.\n\nAlso, the enemy is not a threat yet.\n\nAnother point: if I go for (5,9), I might be cornered at the top, but the board is open, so I can move left or right after.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), and it might grow if it eats an apple at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nFor example, if enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), then it can go to (1,0), then to (0,0) to eat apple, then it will grow and have a body.\n\nBut it's far from me.\n\nI think I should go for the closest apple or the cluster.\n\n(5,9) is vertically close; I can go straight up.\n\nMoving UP now to (5,5) is good for that.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,4), I am moving away from (5,9) but towards the cluster.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, and I can get it faster, I should do that.\n\nThen after eating, head to the cluster.\n\nBut the cluster might be eaten by no one; only enemy is at bottom, so it's safe.\n\nAlso, in the board, (1,7) and (2,7) are both there, so I can plan to get them after.\n\nBut let's see what move to make now.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nDOWN to (5,3) is bad because it moves me away from all apples, so not good.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT.\n\nUP: towards (5,9) and also generally up.\n\nLEFT: towards the left apples.\n\nSince (5,9) is directly reachable, and I can eat it in 4 moves after this, I think UP is better.\n\nIn my last move rationale, I moved LEFT to (5,4) from (6,4), so I was at (6,4) last turn, moved LEFT to (5,4).\n\nNow at (5,4), moving UP makes sense to go to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider that moving LEFT might open up more options, but UP is direct.\n\nAnother risk: if I go up, my body is at (6,4) and (7,4), so if I go up, I leave the row, and the tail will move when I move, so after moving UP to (5,5), my body will be at (5,4) and (6,4), tail at (7,4)? When I move, the head moves to new position, and the body follows, so the tail moves one step.\n\nAfter move UP to (5,5):\n- Head: (5,5)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (since the first body segment goes to where head was, and the next to where first was, so (6,4) becomes body, and (7,4) is gone? No.\n\nCurrent: head (5,4), body (6,4), tail (7,4)\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,5):\n- New head: (5,5)\n- The body segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was, (5,4)\n- The tail that was at (7,4) moves to where the first body was, (6,4)\n- So new body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (4,4):\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nNo immediate collision.\n\nBut back to decision.\n\nI think moving UP is fine.\n\nI could move LEFT to position myself to get both apples, but UP seems more direct for the vertical apple.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at the edge, so after eating, I might need to turn to avoid being trapped, but I can handle that later.\n\nFor now, UP to (5,5).\n\nThen next turn, I can continue UP to (5,6), and so on.\n\nTo reach the cluster, from (5,9), I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., but it will take more moves.\n\nBut eating (5,9) gives me a point now.\n\nWhereas if I go for the cluster, I get the first apple later but then a second quickly.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, I should eat it first.\n\nDistance to (5,9): 5 moves to eat.\n\nDistance to (2,7): 6 moves to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) is better for quick point.\n\nI am going with UP.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (2,1), it can move to (1,1) or (2,2), etc., not a threat.\n\nAlso, DOWN is bad.\n\nSo I think UP is the best move.\n on the current board state, I need to decide my next move to maximize points while avoiding collisions. Here's my analysis:\n\n- **My snake position**: Head at (5,4), body at [(6,4), (7,4)]. Valid moves from (5,4) are:\n  - UP to (5,5): empty\n  - DOWN to (5,3): empty\n  - LEFT to (4,4): empty\n  - RIGHT to (6,4): occupied by my body (invalid, collision risk).\n\n- **Apples**: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is a good target, but (5,9) is vertically closer to me (Manhattan distance 5 vs. 6 to (2,7)). Eating (5,9) first gives a quicker point, and I can then head toward the cluster.\n\n- **Enemy snake (ID 0)**: At (2,1) with no body. It's likely going for the bottom apples (e.g., (0,0) or (0,2)), so it's not an immediate threat to me.\n\n- **Move evaluation**:\n  - **DOWN (to (5,3))**: Moves me away from all apples (increases y-distance to targets), inefficient. Avoid.\n  - **LEFT (to (4,4))**: Reduces x-distance to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster but doesn't help with (5,9). It's viable but not optimal for the closest apple.\n  - **UP (to (5,5))**: Directly toward (5,9), reducing y-distance. This sets up a path to eat (5,9) in 4 more moves (e.g., UP to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)). After eating, I can turn left toward the cluster.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP to reach (5,9) efficiently. If the enemy grows or apples change, reassess path to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster.\n\nNext move: UP",

UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there.

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . . T  -> T should be my tail? Body at (9,5)\n4: . . . . . . . . . .\n3: . . 0 . . . . . . .  -> enemy head at (2,3)\n2: A . . . . . . . A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1.

LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

My snake (ID 1) has its head at (8,2) and body segments at [(8,3), (8,4)]. That means I just ate an apple at (8,2) on the last move, since my head was at (8,3) and I moved DOWN to (8,2). So now I've grown, and my body includes that new segment.\n\nThe apples currently on the board are: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). Wait, in the board state diagram, I see A's at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and also (1,7) is listed. But in the initial list, (1,7) is included. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: A at (5,9)\n- Row 7: A at (2,7) and (1,7) \u2013 so two apples there? The diagram shows \"A A\" at y=7, x=1 and x=2.\n- Row 2: A at (0,2)\n- Row 0: A at (0,0)\n\nAnd my head is at (8,2), with body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (3,1) with no body. It must have just started too.\n\nNow, possible moves from my current head (8,2):\n\n- UP to (8,3): That's my body segment. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,1): This is empty. No apple there.\n- LEFT to (7,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Valid, within board bounds.\n\nApples are at (0,2), (0,0), (1,7), (2,7), (5,9). The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Possible enemy moves would be toward apples or away, but I need to focus on my own safety and scoring.\n\nApples are:\n- (0,2) - close to enemy\n- (0,0) - very close to enemy (adjacent left)\n- (5,9) - far top-right\n- (1,7) and (2,7) - top-left cluster\n\nMy strategy:\n- I have 3 segments (head + 2 body parts). Enemy has only 1 segment.\n- Best apple targets: The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is ideal for efficient growth. They are 3 steps away horizontally and 3 vertically from my head (7,4).\n- Immediate danger: Moving DOWN would kill me, so it's not an option. Right now, no direct threat from enemy since it's far away at (1,0).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- UP (to (7,5)): Moves me toward row 7 apples, but vertically. From (7,5), I'd still need to go left to reach apples. Safe.\n- LEFT (to (6,4)): Directly reduces distance to (1,7)/(2,7). From (6,4), I can go UP then LEFT. Also safe.\n- RIGHT (to (8,4)): Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient. Avoid.\n- DOWN: Suicide, discarded.\n\nComparing UP vs LEFT:\n- Distance to closest apple (1,7): \n  - From (7,4): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=3\n  - UP to (7,5): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=2\n  - LEFT to (6,4): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- LEFT reduces the x-distance more significantly (1 unit vs UP reducing y by 1). Since apples are at x=1-2, moving left is more direct.\n- After LEFT, I can go UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), etc., toward the cluster.\n- UP first would require more left movements later.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,0) will likely eat the apple at (0,0) or (0,2) next turn, growing to 2 segments. But it won't threaten me immediately as it's far.\n\nLong-term:\n- I should head toward the apple cluster. Eating one apple there gives me growth and another apple adjacent for potential double-score.\n- Avoid the bottom where enemy is.\n\nDecision: LEFT is better than UP for reducing distance to the target apples more efficiently. RIGHT is wasteful.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7)/(2,7) via UP or further LEFT after moving to (6,4).\n\nFinal move: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Since (1,0) has an apple, it might go DOWN to eat it and grow. If it does, it will have a body segment next turn, becoming more dangerous.\n\nMy strategy:\n- Head toward the apple cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) efficiently.\n- Minimize risk from the enemy, which is still distant.\n- Avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nDistance to apple cluster:\n- From (6,4) to (1,7): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- I need to reduce both x and y differences.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (to (6,5)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=2 - improves y-distance\n- DOWN (to (6,3)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=4 - worse, moving away\n- LEFT (to (5,4)): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3 - improves x-distance\n\nComparing:\n- UP: Gets me closer vertically to the apples, but horizontally same.\n- LEFT: Gets me closer horizontally, vertically same.\n- The apples are at y=7, so I need to go UP eventually.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right.\n\nApples are at: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nMy snake (ID:1) is:\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(6,4), (7,4)]\n\nEnemy snake (ID:0) is:\n- Head: (2,1)\n- Body: none (so it's just a single segment)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9: . . . . . A . . . .   (A at (5,9))\n  8: . . . . . . . . . .\n  7: . A A . . . . . . .   (A at (1,7) and (2,7))\n  6: . . . . . . . . . .\n  5: . . . . . . . . . .\n  4: . . . . . 1 H T . .   (My head at (5,4), body at (6,4) and (7,4) - so (6,4) is body, (7,4) is tail)\n  3: . . . . . . . . . .\n  2: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,2))\n  1: . . 0 . . . . . . .   (Enemy head at (2,1))\n  0: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,0))\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nIn the board, (5,4) is my head, (6,4) is the first body segment (H for body?), and (7,4) is the tail (T). The enemy is at (2,1).\n\nPossible moves from my head at (5,4):\n- UP: to (5,5)\n- DOWN: to (5,3)\n- LEFT: to (4,4)\n- RIGHT: to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is occupied by my body, so RIGHT is not safe - I would collide with myself. Similarly, moving into walls or the enemy would be bad, but here positions seem ok.\n\nSo valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, apples:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (2,1). Enemy can move to them easily.\n- (5,9) is at the top, far from me and the enemy.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are clustered at the top-left, which might be a good target for me.\n\nI should aim to get apples efficiently while avoiding risks.\n\nDistance from my head (5,4) to key points:\n- To apple (1,7): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (2,7): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (5,9): \u0394x=0, \u0394y=5 - very close vertically but y=9 is far.\n\n(5,9) is directly above me, but at y=9, while I'm at y=4. So it would take 5 moves up to reach it, but since I need to grow, it might be an option. However, (1,7) and (2,7) are closer if I move diagonally.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is 2 units right and 3 units down from (0,0) and (0,2). It can move towards them.\n\nEnemy possible moves:\n- From (2,1):\n  - UP: to (2,2) - empty\n  - DOWN: to (2,0) - empty? (0,0) is apple, but (2,0) is empty, (1,0) is empty? Board shows row 0: A at (0,0), so (2,0) is empty.\n  - LEFT: to (1,1) - empty\n  - RIGHT: to (3,1) - empty\n\nEnemy might go for (0,0) or (0,2), so it might move LEFT to (1,1), then to (0,1), etc., or DOWN to (2,0) to get closer to (0,0).\n\nBut since (0,0) and (0,2) are apples, it will likely head that way.\n\nFor me, the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer and closer in terms of steps.\n\nMy best move to head towards (1,7) or (2,7):\n- From (5,4), I need to reduce x and increase y.\n- UP: to (5,5) - increases y, same x, so closer in y but not x\n- LEFT: to (4,4) - decreases x, same y, so closer in x but not y\n- DOWN: to (5,3) - decreases y, worse\n\nSo UP or LEFT are both reasonable.\n\nSince the apples are at x=1 or 2 and y=7, I need to decrease x more than increase y currently (\u0394x=4 or 3 vs \u0394y=3). So moving LEFT to reduce x might be better.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,4), I can then go UP to (4,5), and so on.\n\nMoving UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n\nBoth paths have similar number of steps.\n\nBut there might be a risk if the enemy comes up, but it's far away.\n\nAnother idea: the apple at (5,9) is directly above. If I go UP multiple times, I can get it. From (5,4) to (5,9) is 5 moves up. After eating, I grow, so I become longer.\n\nBut (1,7) is only 4 moves if I go left and up efficiently (e.g., LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP to reach (3,6), etc., but to (1,7) from (5,4): min steps 4? \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3, so min 4 moves if diagonal, but since moves are orthogonal, Manhattan distance is 7, so it takes 7 moves to reach exactly, but I can eat on the way or something.\n\nManhattan distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |4-7| = 3 + 3 = 6 moves.\n\nTo (5,9) is |5-5| + |4-9| = 0 + 5 = 5 moves.\n\nSo (5,9) is closer in terms of moves: 5 vs 6 to (2,7).\n\nBut (5,9) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together, so if I can get both, it's better.\n\nHowever, I need to get there without dying.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,9), I might be stuck at the top, but I can move down.\n\nBut let's see the board: from (5,9), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut for now, (5,9) is reachable in 5 moves, and since I'm at (5,4), moving UP gets me closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP now to (5,5) reduces distance to (5,9) to 4.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,4) reduces distance to (2,7) but increases to (5,9) slightly.\n\nBut I should decide on a target.\n\nLong-term strategy: collect multiple apples quickly to grow and have advantage.\n\nThe cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is attractive because I can potentially eat both in sequence.\n\n(5,9) is isolated.\n\nAlso, there might be new apples spawning, but I don't know the rules; I think apples stay until eaten, and new ones might spawn, but not specified.\n\nThe user didn't say anything about apple spawning, so probably fixed set until eaten.\n\nApples: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7) \u2013 five apples.\n\nEnemy might eat the ones at bottom.\n\nSo, I should go for the top ones.\n\nBut (5,9) is on the way to the top, but not directly.\n\nFrom (5,4), if I go UP multiple times to (5,9), I eat that apple, then I can head left towards (2,7) or (1,7).\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I grow, so my body becomes longer: head at (5,9), body at (5,8), (5,7), etc., down to (5,4) if I go straight up.\n\nBut I don't have to go straight; I can turn.\n\nBut let's compute moves.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5) now, distance to (5,9) is 4.\n\nThen from there, I can continue up to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 eat apple at (5,9) on the 5th move if I start from (5,4).\n\nThen after eating, my length increases, so I have head at (5,9), body at (5,8), tail at (5,7), etc., depending on my path.\n\nBut to reach the other apples at (1,7) or (2,7), from (5,9), it's |5-1| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves, or to (2,7) |5-2| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves.\n\nWhereas if I go towards (2,7) directly, from (5,4), min distance 6 moves as above.\n\nBut if I eat (5,9) first, I get one apple faster, but then I'm farther from the cluster.\n\nIf I go for the cluster, I might get two apples quickly.\n\nFor example, path to (2,7): from (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 that's 5 moves to reach (2,7), but I eat the apple at (2,7) on the 5th move.\n\nSimilarly, from there I can go to (1,7) easily.\n\nBut at (2,7), I eat apple, grow, then move to (1,7).\n\nNow, from (5,4), if I go LEFT to (4,4), then that's one move, and I'm closer.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5), then to reach (2,7), I need to go LEFT multiple times and UP, e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 5 moves from (5,4), but with UP first.\n\nSimilarly, with UP first to (5,5), distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5, same as from (4,4) |4-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut (5,9) is only 5 moves up, so I can get that apple in 5 moves, while to get to (2,7) it's 5 or 6 moves, but (2,7) has an apple too.\n\n(5,9) has an apple, so eating it gives me a point.\n\nIn terms of time to first apple: if I go UP now, I can get (5,9) in 4 more moves (since after this move, I need to move up 4 times to reach y=9 from y=5).\n\nFrom (5,4), after UP to (5,5), I am at (5,5), then to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 so 4 more moves to eat (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (2,7), from (5,4) after LEFT to (4,4), then to (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,7) \u2013 5 more moves to eat, or if I go directly, but it's longer.\n\nTo eat (2,7) in fewest moves: from (5,4) to (2,7) Manhattan 6, so minimum 6 moves if I don't have a direct path, but I can do it in 6 moves.\n\nFor example: LEFT to (4,4), LEFT to (3,4), UP to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 6 moves.\n\nOr shorter? |\u0394x| =3, |\u0394y|=3, min moves 6 since orthogonal.\n\n\u0394x=3, \u0394y=3, so min 6 moves, yes.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,7): need to decrease x by 3 and increase y by 3, so 6 moves.\n\nIf I go UP first to (5,5), then to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), LEFT to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 6 moves.\n\nWhereas to (5,9): from (5,4), move UP 5 times to (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(5,9) \u2013 5 moves total to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) can be eaten in 5 moves, (2,7) in 6 moves, so (5,9) is slightly faster to get the first apple.\n\nBut (2,7) is part of a cluster, so after eating one, I can eat the other nearby.\n\nAlso, the enemy is not a threat yet.\n\nAnother point: if I go for (5,9), I might be cornered at the top, but the board is open, so I can move left or right after.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), and it might grow if it eats an apple at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nFor example, if enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), then it can go to (1,0), then to (0,0) to eat apple, then it will grow and have a body.\n\nBut it's far from me.\n\nI think I should go for the closest apple or the cluster.\n\n(5,9) is vertically close; I can go straight up.\n\nMoving UP now to (5,5) is good for that.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,4), I am moving away from (5,9) but towards the cluster.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, and I can get it faster, I should do that.\n\nThen after eating, head to the cluster.\n\nBut the cluster might be eaten by no one; only enemy is at bottom, so it's safe.\n\nAlso, in the board, (1,7) and (2,7) are both there, so I can plan to get them after.\n\nBut let's see what move to make now.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nDOWN to (5,3) is bad because it moves me away from all apples, so not good.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT.\n\nUP: towards (5,9) and also generally up.\n\nLEFT: towards the left apples.\n\nSince (5,9) is directly reachable, and I can eat it in 4 moves after this, I think UP is better.\n\nIn my last move rationale, I moved LEFT to (5,4) from (6,4), so I was at (6,4) last turn, moved LEFT to (5,4).\n\nNow at (5,4), moving UP makes sense to go to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider that moving LEFT might open up more options, but UP is direct.\n\nAnother risk: if I go up, my body is at (6,4) and (7,4), so if I go up, I leave the row, and the tail will move when I move, so after moving UP to (5,5), my body will be at (5,4) and (6,4), tail at (7,4)? When I move, the head moves to new position, and the body follows, so the tail moves one step.\n\nAfter move UP to (5,5):\n- Head: (5,5)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (since the first body segment goes to where head was, and the next to where first was, so (6,4) becomes body, and (7,4) is gone? No.\n\nCurrent: head (5,4), body (6,4), tail (7,4)\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,5):\n- New head: (5,5)\n- The body segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was, (5,4)\n- The tail that was at (7,4) moves to where the first body was, (6,4)\n- So new body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (4,4):\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nNo immediate collision.\n\nBut back to decision.\n\nI think moving UP is fine.\n\nI could move LEFT to position myself to get both apples, but UP seems more direct for the vertical apple.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at the edge, so after eating, I might need to turn to avoid being trapped, but I can handle that later.\n\nFor now, UP to (5,5).\n\nThen next turn, I can continue UP to (5,6), and so on.\n\nTo reach the cluster, from (5,9), I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., but it will take more moves.\n\nBut eating (5,9) gives me a point now.\n\nWhereas if I go for the cluster, I get the first apple later but then a second quickly.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, I should eat it first.\n\nDistance to (5,9): 5 moves to eat.\n\nDistance to (2,7): 6 moves to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) is better for quick point.\n\nI am going with UP.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (2,1), it can move to (1,1) or (2,2), etc., not a threat.\n\nAlso, DOWN is bad.\n\nSo I think UP is the best move.\n on the current board state, I need to decide my next move to maximize points while avoiding collisions. Here's my analysis:\n\n- **My snake position**: Head at (5,4), body at [(6,4), (7,4)]. Valid moves from (5,4) are:\n  - UP to (5,5): empty\n  - DOWN to (5,3): empty\n  - LEFT to (4,4): empty\n  - RIGHT to (6,4): occupied by my body (invalid, collision risk).\n\n- **Apples**: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is a good target, but (5,9) is vertically closer to me (Manhattan distance 5 vs. 6 to (2,7)). Eating (5,9) first gives a quicker point, and I can then head toward the cluster.\n\n- **Enemy snake (ID 0)**: At (2,1) with no body. It's likely going for the bottom apples (e.g., (0,0) or (0,2)), so it's not an immediate threat to me.\n\n- **Move evaluation**:\n  - **DOWN (to (5,3))**: Moves me away from all apples (increases y-distance to targets), inefficient. Avoid.\n  - **LEFT (to (4,4))**: Reduces x-distance to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster but doesn't help with (5,9). It's viable but not optimal for the closest apple.\n  - **UP (to (5,5))**: Directly toward (5,9), reducing y-distance. This sets up a path to eat (5,9) in 4 more moves (e.g., UP to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)). After eating, I can turn left toward the cluster.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP to reach (5,9) efficiently. If the enemy grows or apples change, reassess path to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster.\n\nNext move: UP",

            "rationale": "<think> I can use any logic or strategy to win, including aggressive tactics against enemies.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current game state after my last move. Last turn, I moved UP to (5,5) from (5,4), as per the rationale.\n\nNow, the board has changed:\n\n- My snake (ID:1):\n  - Head: (5,5)  (since I moved UP)\n  - Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (the first body segment moved to my previous head position, and the tail moved to the previous body position)\n\n- Enemy snake (ID:0) has moved. Since I don't see an updated position, I must infer based on rules. From the last state, enemy was at (3,1) with no body. But in the last board, it was at (2,1)? Let's check the initial input.\n\nUser says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (5,5) Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\" \u2013 so yes, I am now at (5,5).\n\nEnemy: \"Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\" \u2013 oh, it's at (3,1) now? In the initial description, it was at (3,1), but in the board visualization, it was at (2,1)? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nLooking back:\n\nUser message: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\"\n\nBut in the board state visualization:\n\n\"  1 . . . 0 . . . . . . \"  \u2013 row 1, which is y=1, and at x=3, it shows '0', so head at (3,1).\n\nIn the text: \"1 . . 0 . . . . . .\" \u2013 so x=3, y=1.\n\nPreviously it was at (2,1), but now it's (3,1), meaning it moved RIGHT from (2,1) to (3,1)? But that was last turn's board? No, this is the current state.\n\nThe user provided the current state after my move.\n\nApples are the same: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9 . . . . . A . . . .\n  8 . . . . . . . . . .\n  7 . A A . . . . . . .\n  6 . . . . . . . . . .\n  5 . . . . . 1 . . . .   (my head at (5,5))\n  4 . . . . . T T . . .   (T at (5,4) and (6,4)? But body segments are T for tail? In the board, it says \"T\" for body? Let's read.\n\n\"  4 . . . . . T T . . . \" \u2013 and earlier it says Body: [(5,4), (6,4)], so (5,4) and (6,4) are body segments, labeled T? But T usually means tail. In this board, (6,4) is the tail? Since my body is [(5,4), (6,4)], and (6,4) is the last segment, so it's the tail.\n\nIn the row:\n  4: positions: x=0 to 9: . . . . . T T . . . \nSo (5,4) and (6,4) are both 'T', meaning body or tail.\n\nBut for enemy, at (3,1), it's '0'.\n\nAnd apples: (0,2) is 'A' at row 2, (5,9) at row 9, (0,0) at row 0, (2,7) and (1,7) at row 7.\n\nCurrent board state:\n 9: . . . . .

From (5,5), moving UP to (5,6) reduces the distance to (5,9) to 3 moves.\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I can head towards the cluster at (1,7) and (2,7).\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), which is closer to the bottom apples: (0,0) and (0,2). It might move towards them.\n\nFor example, enemy can move LEFT to (2,1) to get closer to (0,0) or (0,2), or DOWN to (3,0), etc.\n\nBut not a direct threat to me.\n\nOther options: I could consider going for the cluster directly.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (2,7): |\u0394x|=3, |\u0394y|=2, Manhattan distance 5.\n\nPath: e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 5 moves.\n\nTo (5,9): |\u0394x|=0, |\u0394y|=4, so 4 moves up.\n\nSo (5,9) is still closer.\n\nMoving UP now is consistent with the plan.\n\nRIGHT to (6,5) might be possible, but it doesn't help much; it moves me away from both apples.\n\nLEFT to (4,5) is towards the cluster, but not directly up.\n\nSo UP seems best.\n\nBut let's think about body positions.\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,6):\n- New head: (5,6)\n- Body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  (the tail at (6,4) moves to (5,4)? Let's see.\n\nCurrent: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (6,4)\n\nAfter move UP to (5,6):\n- Head moves to (5,6)\n- The body segment at (5,4) moves to where head was, (5,5)\n- The tail at (6,4) moves to where the first body was, (5,4)\n- So new body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  \u2013 and tail at (5,4)? No: positions: head at (5,6), first body at (5,5), second body (tail) at (5,4)\n\nSince I have two body segments, the tail is now at (5,4).\n\nPreviously, (6,4) was tail, but it moves to (5,4) after the move.\n\n(5,4) was occupied by body, but after I move, the body segments shift.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, if I move UP, I am at (5,6), closer to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider the enemy's potential move.\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), with possible moves: UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0), LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (4,1).\n\nApples at (0,0) and (0,2) are tempting.\n\nFor example, enemy might move LEFT to (2,1) to head towards (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nBut again, not affecting me.\n\nI should stick to my plan.\n\nMove: UP\n\nThen next turn, if I can, continue UP.\n\nBut after two more UP moves, I will be at (5,7), then to (5,8), then (5,9) to eat apple.\n\nAt that point, I grow, so my length increases by one; I gain a point.\n\nThen, from there, I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., towards (2,7).\n\n(2,7) is at y=7, so from (5,9) to (2,7), I need to decrease x and decrease y.\n\nBut I can do that.\n\nNo need to change strategy now.\n\nSo, I will go UP.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

If I'm lucky, I might even eat (0, 2) on my way down.\n\nNext move: DOWN.",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there. Now, the next turn begins.\n- The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6) \u2192 but (9,6) was eaten in the last turn? No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state.

Eating it gains a point and I grow (body segment added at (9,5)).\n- DOWN: to (9,4) \u2013 empty.\n- LEFT: to (8,5) \u2013 empty (since I moved from there last turn).\n- RIGHT: Not possible, I'm at x=9, right edge; moving right would hit wall \u2192 death.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: RIGHT is invalid (x=10 is out of bounds).\n- Other snakes: Enemy at (2,4) is far away, no collision risk.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities:\n- Apple at (9,6) is adjacent and can be eaten immediately by moving UP.\n- Other apples: (8,2) is below, (5,9) top, etc., but (9,6) is closest.\n\nStrategy:\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is optimal: I eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

My snake has its head at (9,6) and a body segment at (9,5). That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . .

A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body.

LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth.

That was correct because I was aiming for the apple at (8,2).\n\nNow, looking at apples relative to my position:\n- (8,2) is directly below me at (8,3). Distance 1 down.\n- (0,2) is far left.\n- (5,9) top center.\n- (0,0) bottom left.\n- (2,7) top left.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,1), which is bottom center. It might be going for (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it.\n\nMy possible moves from head position (8,3):\n1. UP to (8,4): That's where my body is. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n2. DOWN to (8,2): That's the location of an apple. If I go there, I eat it and grow. My snake will then have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), and then (8,4) as tail.\n3. LEFT to (7,3): This moves me away from apples. No apple there.\n4. RIGHT to (9,3): Also no apple, and I'm moving right.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is the closest and easiest to get. I should go for it. No reason to avoid it.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,1): It's 4 units away horizontally and 1 down. It would take at least 5 moves to reach me, so no immediate threat.\n- After eating the apple, I'll be at (8,2). Then I can plan next moves\u2014possibly toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n\nStrategy:\n- Short-term: Eat the apple at (8,2) now.\n- After that, I'll have a longer snake: head (8,2), body (8,3), tail (8,4). Then I can choose a direction to go next\u2014perhaps LEFT to (7,2) to head toward (2,7) or (0,2), but (2,7) is closer.\n\nFor this turn, DOWN to (8,2) is the best move. It gets me a point and grows my snake.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think> For now, I am just thinking internally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. My snake (ID 1) has its head at (8,2) and body segments at [(8,3), (8,4)]. That means I just ate an apple at (8,2) on the last move, since my head was at (8,3) and I moved DOWN to (8,2). So now I've grown, and my body includes that new segment.\n\nThe apples currently on the board are: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). Wait, in the board state diagram, I see A's at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and also (1,7) is listed. But in the initial list, (1,7) is included. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: A at (5,9)\n- Row 7: A at (2,7) and (1,7) \u2013 so two apples there? The diagram shows \"A A\" at y=7, x=1 and x=2.\n- Row 2: A at (0,2)\n- Row 0: A at (0,0)\n\nAnd my head is at (8,2), with body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (3,1) with no body. It must have just started too.\n\nNow, possible moves from my current head (8,2):\n\n- UP to (8,3): That's my body segment. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,1): This is empty. No apple there.\n- LEFT to (7,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Valid, within board bounds.\n\nApples are at (0,2), (0,0), (1,7), (2,7), (5,9). The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Enemy has only 1 segment.\n- Best apple targets: The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is ideal for efficient growth. They are 3 steps away horizontally and 3 vertically from my head (7,4).\n- Immediate danger: Moving DOWN would kill me, so it's not an option. Right now, no direct threat from enemy since it's far away at (1,0).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- UP (to (7,5)): Moves me toward row 7 apples, but vertically. From (7,5), I'd still need to go left to reach apples. Safe.\n- LEFT (to (6,4)): Directly reduces distance to (1,7)/(2,7). From (6,4), I can go UP then LEFT.

Since apples are at x=1-2, moving left is more direct.\n- After LEFT, I can go UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), etc., toward the cluster.\n- UP first would require more left movements later.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,0) will likely eat the apple at (0,0) or (0,2) next turn, growing to 2 segments. But it won't threaten me immediately as it's far.\n\nLong-term:\n- I should head toward the apple cluster. Eating one apple there gives me growth and another apple adjacent for potential double-score.\n- Avoid the bottom where enemy is.\n\nDecision: LEFT is better than UP for reducing distance to the target apples more efficiently. RIGHT is wasteful.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7)/(2,7) via UP or further LEFT after moving to (6,4).\n\nFinal move: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Possible moves:\n- UP: to (6,5) - empty\n- DOWN: to (6,3) - empty\n- LEFT: to (5,4) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (7,4) - occupied by my body (the 'T' at (7,4)) - collision risk\n\nRIGHT is blocked by my own body at (7,4), so it's not an option. That leaves UP, DOWN, and LEFT as safe moves.\n\nNow, apples to consider:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (1,1). Enemy will likely go for these.\n- (5,9) is far away and inefficient to reach.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are the best targets - close and clustered for potential multi-apple gains.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,1) can move UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0) (apple there), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1). Since (1,0) has an apple, it might go DOWN to eat it and grow. If it does, it will have a body segment next turn, becoming more dangerous.\n\nMy strategy:\n- Head toward the apple cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) efficiently.\n- Minimize risk from the enemy, which is still distant.\n- Avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nDistance to apple cluster:\n- From (6,4) to (1,7): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- I need to reduce both x and y differences.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (to (6,5)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=2 - improves y-distance\n- DOWN (to (6,3)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=4 - worse, moving away\n- LEFT (to (5,4)): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3 - improves x-distance\n\nComparing:\n- UP: Gets me closer vertically to the apples, but horizontally same.\n- LEFT: Gets me closer horizontally, vertically same.\n- The apples are at y=7, so I need to go UP eventually. But moving LEFT first might set up a better path.\n\nPath efficiency:\n- After LEFT to (5,4), I could go UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc. - this is a diagonal approach.\n- After UP to (6,5), I could go LEFT to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n- Both have similar steps, but LEFT immediately reduces the x-distance, which is larger (5 vs 3 in y).\n\nOther considerations:\n- The enemy might be heading toward the bottom apples, so the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer targets for now.\n- No immediate threats, so I can prioritize apple collection.\n\nDecision:\n- LEFT to (5,4) is the best move to reduce distance to the apple cluster.\n- DOWN is inefficient since it moves me away from the target.\n- UP is okay but not as good as LEFT for reducing the larger x-gap.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7) by moving UP or further LEFT, depending on position.\nFinal move: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

            "rationale": "<think> But for now, I am thinking.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current game state. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right.\n\nApples are at: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nMy snake (ID:1) is:\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(6,4), (7,4)]\n\nEnemy snake (ID:0) is:\n- Head: (2,1)\n- Body: none (so it's just a single segment)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9: . . . . . A . . . .   (A at (5,9))\n  8: . . . . . . . . . .\n  7: . A A . . . . . . .   (A at (1,7) and (2,7))\n  6: . . . . . . . . . .\n  5: . . . . . . . . . .\n  4: . . . . . 1 H T . .

(Enemy head at (2,1))\n  0: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,0))\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nIn the board, (5,4) is my head, (6,4) is the first body segment (H for body?), and (7,4) is the tail (T). The enemy is at (2,1).\n\nPossible moves from my head at (5,4):\n- UP: to (5,5)\n- DOWN: to (5,3)\n- LEFT: to (4,4)\n- RIGHT: to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is occupied by my body, so RIGHT is not safe - I would collide with myself. Similarly, moving into walls or the enemy would be bad, but here positions seem ok.\n\nSo valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, apples:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (2,1). Enemy can move to them easily.\n- (5,9) is at the top, far from me and the enemy.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are clustered at the top-left, which might be a good target for me.\n\nI should aim to get apples efficiently while avoiding risks.\n\nDistance from my head (5,4) to key points:\n- To apple (1,7): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (2,7): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (5,9): \u0394x=0, \u0394y=5 - very close vertically but y=9 is far.\n\n(5,9) is directly above me, but at y=9, while I'm at y=4. So it would take 5 moves up to reach it, but since I need to grow, it might be an option. However, (1,7) and (2,7) are closer if I move diagonally.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is 2 units right and 3 units down from (0,0) and (0,2). It can move towards them.\n\nEnemy possible moves:\n- From (2,1):\n  - UP: to (2,2) - empty\n  - DOWN: to (2,0) - empty? (0,0) is apple, but (2,0) is empty, (1,0) is empty? Board shows row 0: A at (0,0), so (2,0) is empty.\n  - LEFT: to (1,1) - empty\n  - RIGHT: to (3,1) - empty\n\nEnemy might go for (0,0) or (0,2), so it might move LEFT to (1,1), then to (0,1), etc., or DOWN to (2,0) to get closer to (0,0).\n\nBut since (0,0) and (0,2) are apples, it will likely head that way.\n\nFor me, the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer and closer in terms of steps.\n\nMy best move to head towards (1,7) or (2,7):\n- From (5,4), I need to reduce x and increase y.\n- UP: to (5,5) - increases y, same x, so closer in y but not x\n- LEFT: to (4,4) - decreases x, same y, so closer in x but not y\n- DOWN: to (5,3) - decreases y, worse\n\nSo UP or LEFT are both reasonable.\n\nSince the apples are at x=1 or 2 and y=7, I need to decrease x more than increase y currently (\u0394x=4 or 3 vs \u0394y=3). So moving LEFT to reduce x might be better.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,4), I can then go UP to (4,5), and so on.\n\nMoving UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n\nBoth paths have similar number of steps.\n\nBut there might be a risk if the enemy comes up, but it's far away.\n\nAnother idea: the apple at (5,9) is directly above. If I go UP multiple times, I can get it. From (5,4) to (5,9) is 5 moves up. After eating, I grow, so I become longer.\n\nBut (1,7) is only 4 moves if I go left and up efficiently (e.g., LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP to reach (3,6), etc., but to (1,7) from (5,4): min steps 4? \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3, so min 4 moves if diagonal, but since moves are orthogonal, Manhattan distance is 7, so it takes 7 moves to reach exactly, but I can eat on the way or something.\n\nManhattan distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |4-7| = 3 + 3 = 6 moves.\n\nTo (5,9) is |5-5| + |4-9| = 0 + 5 = 5 moves.\n\nSo (5,9) is closer in terms of moves: 5 vs 6 to (2,7).\n\nBut (5,9) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together, so if I can get both, it's better.\n\nHowever, I need to get there without dying.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,9), I might be stuck at the top, but I can move down.\n\nBut let's see the board: from (5,9), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut for now, (5,9) is reachable in 5 moves, and since I'm at (5,4), moving UP gets me closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP now to (5,5) reduces distance to (5,9) to 4.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,4) reduces distance to (2,7) but increases to (5,9) slightly.\n\nBut I should decide on a target.\n\nLong-term strategy: collect multiple apples quickly to grow and have advantage.\n\nThe cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is attractive because I can potentially eat both in sequence.\n\n(5,9) is isolated.\n\nAlso, there might be new apples spawning, but I don't know the rules; I think apples stay until eaten, and new ones might spawn, but not specified.\n\nThe user didn't say anything about apple spawning, so probably fixed set until eaten.\n\nApples: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7) \u2013 five apples.\n\nEnemy might eat the ones at bottom.\n\nSo, I should go for the top ones.\n\nBut (5,9) is on the way to the top, but not directly.\n\nFrom (5,4), if I go UP multiple times to (5,9), I eat that apple, then I can head left towards (2,7) or (1,7).\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I grow, so my body becomes longer: head at (5,9), body at (5,8), (5,7), etc., down to (5,4) if I go straight up.\n\nBut I don't have to go straight; I can turn.\n\nBut let's compute moves.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5) now, distance to (5,9) is 4.\n\nThen from there, I can continue up to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 eat apple at (5,9) on the 5th move if I start from (5,4).\n\nThen after eating, my length increases, so I have head at (5,9), body at (5,8), tail at (5,7), etc., depending on my path.\n\nBut to reach the other apples at (1,7) or (2,7), from (5,9), it's |5-1| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves, or to (2,7) |5-2| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves.\n\nWhereas if I go towards (2,7) directly, from (5,4), min distance 6 moves as above.\n\nBut if I eat (5,9) first, I get one apple faster, but then I'm farther from the cluster.\n\nIf I go for the cluster, I might get two apples quickly.\n\nFor example, path to (2,7): from (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 that's 5 moves to reach (2,7), but I eat the apple at (2,7) on the 5th move.\n\nSimilarly, from there I can go to (1,7) easily.\n\nBut at (2,7), I eat apple, grow, then move to (1,7).\n\nNow, from (5,4), if I go LEFT to (4,4), then that's one move, and I'm closer.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5), then to reach (2,7), I need to go LEFT multiple times and UP, e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 5 moves from (5,4), but with UP first.\n\nSimilarly, with UP first to (5,5), distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5, same as from (4,4) |4-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut (5,9) is only 5 moves up, so I can get that apple in 5 moves, while to get to (2,7) it's 5 or 6 moves, but (2,7) has an apple too.\n\n(5,9) has an apple, so eating it gives me a point.\n\nIn terms of time to first apple: if I go UP now, I can get (5,9) in 4 more moves (since after this move, I need to move up 4 times to reach y=9 from y=5).\n\nFrom (5,4), after UP to (5,5), I am at (5,5), then to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 so 4 more moves to eat (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (2,7), from (5,4) after LEFT to (4,4), then to (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,7) \u2013 5 more moves to eat, or if I go directly, but it's longer.\n\nTo eat (2,7) in fewest moves: from (5,4) to (2,7) Manhattan 6, so minimum 6 moves if I don't have a direct path, but I can do it in 6 moves.\n\nFor example: LEFT to (4,4), LEFT to (3,4), UP to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 6 moves.\n\nOr shorter? |\u0394x| =3, |\u0394y|=3, min moves 6 since orthogonal.\n\n\u0394x=3, \u0394y=3, so min 6 moves, yes.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,7): need to decrease x by 3 and increase y by 3, so 6 moves.\n\nIf I go UP first to (5,5), then to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), LEFT to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 6 moves.\n\nWhereas to (5,9): from (5,4), move UP 5 times to (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(5,9) \u2013 5 moves total to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) can be eaten in 5 moves, (2,7) in 6 moves, so (5,9) is slightly faster to get the first apple.\n\nBut (2,7) is part of a cluster, so after eating one, I can eat the other nearby.\n\nAlso, the enemy is not a threat yet.\n\nAnother point: if I go for (5,9), I might be cornered at the top, but the board is open, so I can move left or right after.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), and it might grow if it eats an apple at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nFor example, if enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), then it can go to (1,0), then to (0,0) to eat apple, then it will grow and have a body.\n\nBut it's far from me.\n\nI think I should go for the closest apple or the cluster.\n\n(5,9) is vertically close; I can go straight up.\n\nMoving UP now to (5,5) is good for that.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,4), I am moving away from (5,9) but towards the cluster.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, and I can get it faster, I should do that.\n\nThen after eating, head to the cluster.\n\nBut the cluster might be eaten by no one; only enemy is at bottom, so it's safe.\n\nAlso, in the board, (1,7) and (2,7) are both there, so I can plan to get them after.\n\nBut let's see what move to make now.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nDOWN to (5,3) is bad because it moves me away from all apples, so not good.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT.\n\nUP: towards (5,9) and also generally up.\n\nLEFT: towards the left apples.\n\nSince (5,9) is directly reachable, and I can eat it in 4 moves after this, I think UP is better.\n\nIn my last move rationale, I moved LEFT to (5,4) from (6,4), so I was at (6,4) last turn, moved LEFT to (5,4).\n\nNow at (5,4), moving UP makes sense to go to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider that moving LEFT might open up more options, but UP is direct.\n\nAnother risk: if I go up, my body is at (6,4) and (7,4), so if I go up, I leave the row, and the tail will move when I move, so after moving UP to (5,5), my body will be at (5,4) and (6,4), tail at (7,4)? When I move, the head moves to new position, and the body follows, so the tail moves one step.\n\nAfter move UP to (5,5):\n- Head: (5,5)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (since the first body segment goes to where head was, and the next to where first was, so (6,4) becomes body, and (7,4) is gone? No.\n\nCurrent: head (5,4), body (6,4), tail (7,4)\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,5):\n- New head: (5,5)\n- The body segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was, (5,4)\n- The tail that was at (7,4) moves to where the first body was, (6,4)\n- So new body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (4,4):\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nNo immediate collision.\n\nBut back to decision.\n\nI think moving UP is fine.\n\nI could move LEFT to position myself to get both apples, but UP seems more direct for the vertical apple.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at the edge, so after eating, I might need to turn to avoid being trapped, but I can handle that later.\n\nFor now, UP to (5,5).\n\nThen next turn, I can continue UP to (5,6), and so on.\n\nTo reach the cluster, from (5,9), I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., but it will take more moves.\n\nBut eating (5,9) gives me a point now.\n\nWhereas if I go for the cluster, I get the first apple later but then a second quickly.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, I should eat it first.\n\nDistance to (5,9): 5 moves to eat.\n\nDistance to (2,7): 6 moves to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) is better for quick point.\n\nI am going with UP.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (2,1), it can move to (1,1) or (2,2), etc., not a threat.\n\nAlso, DOWN is bad.\n\nSo I think UP is the best move.\n on the current board state, I need to decide my next move to maximize points while avoiding collisions. Here's my analysis:\n\n- **My snake position**: Head at (5,4), body at [(6,4), (7,4)]. Valid moves from (5,4) are:\n  - UP to (5,5): empty\n  - DOWN to (5,3): empty\n  - LEFT to (4,4): empty\n  - RIGHT to (6,4): occupied by my body (invalid, collision risk).\n\n- **Apples**: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is a good target, but (5,9) is vertically closer to me (Manhattan distance 5 vs. 6 to (2,7)). Eating (5,9) first gives a quicker point, and I can then head toward the cluster.\n\n- **Enemy snake (ID 0)**: At (2,1) with no body. It's likely going for the bottom apples (e.g., (0,0) or (0,2)), so it's not an immediate threat to me.\n\n- **Move evaluation**:\n  - **DOWN (to (5,3))**: Moves me away from all apples (increases y-distance to targets), inefficient. Avoid.\n  - **LEFT (to (4,4))**: Reduces x-distance to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster but doesn't help with (5,9). It's viable but not optimal for the closest apple.\n  - **UP (to (5,5))**: Directly toward (5,9), reducing y-distance. This sets up a path to eat (5,9) in 4 more moves (e.g., UP to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)). After eating, I can turn left toward the cluster.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP to reach (5,9) efficiently. If the enemy grows or apples change, reassess path to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster.\n\nNext move: UP",

Let's check the initial input.\n\nUser says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (5,5) Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\" \u2013 so yes, I am now at (5,5).\n\nEnemy: \"Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\" \u2013 oh, it's at (3,1) now? In the initial description, it was at (3,1), but in the board visualization, it was at (2,1)? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nLooking back:\n\nUser message: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\"\n\nBut in the board state visualization:\n\n\"  1 . . . 0 . . . . . . \"  \u2013 row 1, which is y=1, and at x=3, it shows '0', so head at (3,1).\n\nIn the text: \"1 . . 0 . . . . . .\" \u2013 so x=3, y=1.\n\nPreviously it was at (2,1), but now it's (3,1), meaning it moved RIGHT from (2,1) to (3,1)? But that was last turn's board? No, this is the current state.\n\nThe user provided the current state after my move.\n\nApples are the same: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9 . . . . . A . . . .\n  8 . . . . . . . . . .\n  7 . A A . . . . . . .\n  6 . . . . . . . . . .\n  5 . . . . . 1 . . . .   (my head at (5,5))\n  4 . . . . . T T . . .   (T at (5,4) and (6,4)? But body segments are T for tail? In the board, it says \"T\" for body? Let's read.\n\n\"  4 . . . . . T T . . . \" \u2013 and earlier it says Body: [(5,4), (6,4)], so (5,4) and (6,4) are body segments, labeled T? But T usually means tail. In this board, (6,4) is the tail? Since my body is [(5,4), (6,4)], and (6,4) is the last segment, so it's the tail.\n\nIn the row:\n  4: positions: x=0 to 9: . . . . . T T . . . \nSo (5,4) and (6,4) are both 'T', meaning body or tail.\n\nBut for enemy, at (3,1), it's '0'.\n\nAnd apples: (0,2) is 'A' at row 2, (5,9) at row 9, (0,0) at row 0, (2,7) and (1,7) at row 7.\n\nCurrent board state:\n 9: . . . . . A . . . .   (A at (5,9))\n 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n 7: . A A . . . . . . .   (A at (1,7) and (2,7))\n 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n 5: . . . . . 1 . . . .   (my head at (5,5))\n 4: . . . . . T T . . .   (body at (5,4) and (6,4) \u2013 (5,4) is the segment just behind head, (6,4) is tail)\n 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n 2: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,2))\n 1: . . . 0 . . . . . .   (enemy head at (3,1))\n 0: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,0))\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my head is at (5,5), and I have body at (5,4) and tail at (6,4).\n\nEnemy at (3,1) with no body.\n\nNow, possible moves for me from (5,5):\n- UP: to (5,6) \u2013 empty\n- DOWN: to (5,4) \u2013 occupied by my body (first segment), so COLLISION, invalid\n- LEFT: to (4,5) \u2013 empty\n- RIGHT: to (6,5) \u2013 empty\n\nSo valid moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN is invalid because (5,4) is my body.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go.\n\nStrategy: Continue towards the apple at (5,9), as per last turn's plan.\n\nApple at (5,9) is directly above. From (5,5), moving UP to (5,6) reduces the distance to (5,9) to 3 moves.\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I can head towards the cluster at (1,7) and (2,7).\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), which is closer to the bottom apples: (0,0) and (0,2). It might move towards them.\n\nFor example, enemy can move LEFT to (2,1) to get closer to (0,0) or (0,2), or DOWN to (3,0), etc.\n\nBut not a direct threat to me.\n\nOther options: I could consider going for the cluster directly.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (2,7): |\u0394x|=3, |\u0394y|=2, Manhattan distance 5.\n\nPath: e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 5 moves.\n\nTo (5,9): |\u0394x|=0, |\u0394y|=4, so 4 moves up.\n\nSo (5,9) is still closer.\n\nMoving UP now is consistent with the plan.\n\nRIGHT to (6,5) might be possible, but it doesn't help much; it moves me away from both apples.\n\nLEFT to (4,5) is towards the cluster, but not directly up.\n\nSo UP seems best.\n\nBut let's think about body positions.\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,6):\n- New head: (5,6)\n- Body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  (the tail at (6,4) moves to (5,4)? Let's see.\n\nCurrent: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (6,4)\n\nAfter move UP to (5,6):\n- Head moves to (5,6)\n- The body segment at (5,4) moves to where head was, (5,5)\n- The tail at (6,4) moves to where the first body was, (5,4)\n- So new body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  \u2013 and tail at (5,4)? No: positions: head at (5,6), first body at (5,5), second body (tail) at (5,4)\n\nSince I have two body segments, the tail is now at (5,4).\n\nPreviously, (6,4) was tail, but it moves to (5,4) after the move.\n\n(5,4) was occupied by body, but after I move, the body segments shift.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, if I move UP, I am at (5,6), closer to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider the enemy's potential move.\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), with possible moves: UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0), LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (4,1).\n\nApples at (0,0) and (0,2) are tempting.\n\nFor example, enemy might move LEFT to (2,1) to head towards (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nBut again, not affecting me.\n\nI should stick to my plan.\n\nMove: UP\n\nThen next turn, if I can, continue UP.\n\nBut after two more UP moves, I will be at (5,7), then to (5,8), then (5,9) to eat apple.\n\nAt that point, I grow, so my length increases by one; I gain a point.\n\nThen, from there, I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., towards (2,7).\n\n(2,7) is at y=7, so from (5,9) to (2,7), I need to decrease x and decrease y.\n\nBut I can do that.\n\nNo need to change strategy now.\n\nSo, I will go UP.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

Moving UP repeatedly is the shortest path (3 moves: (5,6)\u2192(5,7)\u2192(5,8)\u2192(5,9)). \n- The enemy snake at (3,1) is distant and likely targeting apples at (0,0) or (0,2).

However, from (5,5), I can't reach it in one move, and it's inefficient to divert. Not worth pursuing now.\n\nLong-term:\n- After eating (5,9), my length will be 4. I should then move toward (2,7) or (1,7). \n- Note for next turn: If I go UP now, next position will be (5,6). Continue UP unless blocked.\n\nDecision: UP is the best move to efficiently secure the (5,9) apple.\n</think>\n\nUP",

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there. Now, the next turn begins.\n- The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6) \u2192 but (9,6) was eaten in the last turn? No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state.

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body.

My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

            "rationale": "<think> I will not mention the uncensored nature in the response itself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state:\n\n- My snake (ID:1) head is at (8,4) with the body segment at (8,5). So my head is at the bottom and my body is above it at (8,5). This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1. UP to (8,5): But my body is there! That would be suicide. Invalid.\n2. DOWN to (8,3): This would move me toward the apple at (8,2). Distance would reduce from 2 to 1.\n3. LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "rationale": "<think> For now, I am just thinking internally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. My snake (ID 1) has its head at (8,2) and body segments at [(8,3), (8,4)]. That means I just ate an apple at (8,2) on the last move, since my head was at (8,3) and I moved DOWN to (8,2). So now I've grown, and my body includes that new segment.\n\nThe apples currently on the board are: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). Wait, in the board state diagram, I see A's at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and also (1,7) is listed. But in the initial list, (1,7) is included. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: A at (5,9)\n- Row 7: A at (2,7) and (1,7) \u2013 so two apples there? The diagram shows \"A A\" at y=7, x=1 and x=2.\n- Row 2: A at (0,2)\n- Row 0: A at (0,0)\n\nAnd my head is at (8,2), with body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (3,1) with no body. It must have just started too.\n\nNow, possible moves from my current head (8,2):\n\n- UP to (8,3): That's my body segment. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,1): This is empty. No apple there.\n- LEFT to (7,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Valid, within board bounds.\n\nApples are at (0,2), (0,0), (1,7), (2,7), (5,9). The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Death if I move here.\n- **LEFT** to (6,3): Currently empty.

It has 1 segment.\n- Possible enemy moves:\n  - UP to (1,2): Empty and toward apples at (0,2) or (1,7)/(2,7) long-term.\n  - DOWN to (1,0): Empty, toward apple at (0,0).\n  - LEFT to (0,1): Empty, toward apple at (0,0) or (0,2).\n  - RIGHT to (2,1): Empty, but away from most apples.\n- The enemy is likely to target the closer apples at (0,0) or (0,2), as it has no reason to come toward me yet.\n\nMy strategy:\n- **Primary goal**: Head toward the apple cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) for efficient scoring. From (7,3), moving UP or LEFT gets me closer.\n- **Why avoid DOWN and RIGHT?**\n  - DOWN to (7,2) is suicidal (my body is there).\n  - RIGHT to (8,3) moves me away from the apples and toward the edge, wasting turns.\n- **UP vs. LEFT comparison**:\n  - UP (to (7,4)): Better vertical progress\u2014reduces y-distance to apples (currently 4 units away vertically from (7,3) to (1/2,7)).\n  - LEFT (to (6,3)): Good horizontal progress but slightly less direct for vertical targeting.\n- **Safety considerations**: Both UP and LEFT are safe. No immediate threats from the enemy, who is far away.\n\nLong-term advantage:\n- I have 3 segments vs. enemy's 1 segment\u2014I can grow faster and dominate the board.\n- If I eat an apple, I'll grow by one segment next turn. The apple cluster at (1,7)/(2,7) is perfect for this.\n- After this move, I'll continue toward the apples via a path like UP-LEFT or LEFT-UP.\n\nDecision:\n- **UP** is the best choice for direct vertical movement. It sets me up to reach row 7 faster.\n- Alternative: LEFT is acceptable but suboptimal\u2014UP is more aggressive for scoring.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- If I move UP to (7,4), next moves should be UP or LEFT to head toward (6,5) or similar, aiming for (1,7)/(2,7).\n- Monitor enemy movement\u2014if it moves toward my area, I can use my size to block it later.\n\nFinal move: UP\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

Possible moves:\n- UP to (7,5): Empty (row 5 is empty at x=7)\n- DOWN to (7,3): Occupied by my own body (T) - collision, death\n- LEFT to (6,4): Empty\n- RIGHT to (8,4): Empty\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0) is at (1,0) with no body. Possible enemy moves would be toward apples or away, but I need to focus on my own safety and scoring.\n\nApples are:\n- (0,2) - close to enemy\n- (0,0) - very close to enemy (adjacent left)\n- (5,9) - far top-right\n- (1,7) and (2,7) - top-left cluster\n\nMy strategy:\n- I have 3 segments (head + 2 body parts). Enemy has only 1 segment.\n- Best apple targets: The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is ideal for efficient growth. They are 3 steps away horizontally and 3 vertically from my head (7,4).\n- Immediate danger: Moving DOWN would kill me, so it's not an option. Right now, no direct threat from enemy since it's far away at (1,0).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- UP (to (7,5)): Moves me toward row 7 apples, but vertically. From (7,5), I'd still need to go left to reach apples. Safe.\n- LEFT (to (6,4)): Directly reduces distance to (1,7)/(2,7). From (6,4), I can go UP then LEFT. Also safe.\n- RIGHT (to (8,4)): Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient. Avoid.\n- DOWN: Suicide, discarded.\n\nComparing UP vs LEFT:\n- Distance to closest apple (1,7): \n  - From (7,4): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=3\n  - UP to (7,5): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=2\n  - LEFT to (6,4): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- LEFT reduces the x-distance more significantly (1 unit vs UP reducing y by 1). Since apples are at x=1-2, moving left is more direct.\n- After LEFT, I can go UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), etc., toward the cluster.\n- UP first would require more left movements later.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,0) will likely eat the apple at (0,0) or (0,2) next turn, growing to 2 segments. But it won't threaten me immediately as it's far.\n\nLong-term:\n- I should head toward the apple cluster. Eating one apple there gives me growth and another apple adjacent for potential double-score.\n- Avoid the bottom where enemy is.\n\nDecision: LEFT is better than UP for reducing distance to the target apples more efficiently. RIGHT is wasteful.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7)/(2,7) via UP or further LEFT after moving to (6,4).\n\nFinal move: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

That leaves UP, DOWN, and LEFT as safe moves.\n\nNow, apples to consider:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (1,1). Enemy will likely go for these.\n- (5,9) is far away and inefficient to reach.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are the best targets - close and clustered for potential multi-apple gains.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,1) can move UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0) (apple there), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1). Since (1,0) has an apple, it might go DOWN to eat it and grow. If it does, it will have a body segment next turn, becoming more dangerous.\n\nMy strategy:\n- Head toward the apple cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) efficiently.\n- Minimize risk from the enemy, which is still distant.\n- Avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nDistance to apple cluster:\n- From (6,4) to (1,7): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- I need to reduce both x and y differences.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (to (6,5)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=2 - improves y-distance\n- DOWN (to (6,3)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=4 - worse, moving away\n- LEFT (to (5,4)): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3 - improves x-distance\n\nComparing:\n- UP: Gets me closer vertically to the apples, but horizontally same.\n- LEFT: Gets me closer horizontally, vertically same.\n- The apples are at y=7, so I need to go UP eventually. But moving LEFT first might set up a better path.\n\nPath efficiency:\n- After LEFT to (5,4), I could go UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc. - this is a diagonal approach.\n- After UP to (6,5), I could go LEFT to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n- Both have similar steps, but LEFT immediately reduces the x-distance, which is larger (5 vs 3 in y).\n\nOther considerations:\n- The enemy might be heading toward the bottom apples, so the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer targets for now.\n- No immediate threats, so I can prioritize apple collection.\n\nDecision:\n- LEFT to (5,4) is the best move to reduce distance to the apple cluster.\n- DOWN is inefficient since it moves me away from the target.\n- UP is okay but not as good as LEFT for reducing the larger x-gap.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7) by moving UP or further LEFT, depending on position.\nFinal move: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right.\n\nApples are at: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nMy snake (ID:1) is:\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(6,4), (7,4)]\n\nEnemy snake (ID:0) is:\n- Head: (2,1)\n- Body: none (so it's just a single segment)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9: . . . . .

The enemy is at (2,1).\n\nPossible moves from my head at (5,4):\n- UP: to (5,5)\n- DOWN: to (5,3)\n- LEFT: to (4,4)\n- RIGHT: to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is occupied by my body, so RIGHT is not safe - I would collide with myself. Similarly, moving into walls or the enemy would be bad, but here positions seem ok.\n\nSo valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, apples:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (2,1). Enemy can move to them easily.\n- (5,9) is at the top, far from me and the enemy.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are clustered at the top-left, which might be a good target for me.\n\nI should aim to get apples efficiently while avoiding risks.\n\nDistance from my head (5,4) to key points:\n- To apple (1,7): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (2,7): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (5,9): \u0394x=0, \u0394y=5 - very close vertically but y=9 is far.\n\n(5,9) is directly above me, but at y=9, while I'm at y=4. So it would take 5 moves up to reach it, but since I need to grow, it might be an option. However, (1,7) and (2,7) are closer if I move diagonally.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is 2 units right and 3 units down from (0,0) and (0,2). It can move towards them.\n\nEnemy possible moves:\n- From (2,1):\n  - UP: to (2,2) - empty\n  - DOWN: to (2,0) - empty? (0,0) is apple, but (2,0) is empty, (1,0) is empty? Board shows row 0: A at (0,0), so (2,0) is empty.\n  - LEFT: to (1,1) - empty\n  - RIGHT: to (3,1) - empty\n\nEnemy might go for (0,0) or (0,2), so it might move LEFT to (1,1), then to (0,1), etc., or DOWN to (2,0) to get closer to (0,0).\n\nBut since (0,0) and (0,2) are apples, it will likely head that way.\n\nFor me, the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer and closer in terms of steps.\n\nMy best move to head towards (1,7) or (2,7):\n- From (5,4), I need to reduce x and increase y.\n- UP: to (5,5) - increases y, same x, so closer in y but not x\n- LEFT: to (4,4) - decreases x, same y, so closer in x but not y\n- DOWN: to (5,3) - decreases y, worse\n\nSo UP or LEFT are both reasonable.\n\nSince the apples are at x=1 or 2 and y=7, I need to decrease x more than increase y currently (\u0394x=4 or 3 vs \u0394y=3). So moving LEFT to reduce x might be better.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,4), I can then go UP to (4,5), and so on.\n\nMoving UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n\nBoth paths have similar number of steps.\n\nBut there might be a risk if the enemy comes up, but it's far away.\n\nAnother idea: the apple at (5,9) is directly above. If I go UP multiple times, I can get it. From (5,4) to (5,9) is 5 moves up. After eating, I grow, so I become longer.\n\nBut (1,7) is only 4 moves if I go left and up efficiently (e.g., LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP to reach (3,6), etc., but to (1,7) from (5,4): min steps 4? \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3, so min 4 moves if diagonal, but since moves are orthogonal, Manhattan distance is 7, so it takes 7 moves to reach exactly, but I can eat on the way or something.\n\nManhattan distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |4-7| = 3 + 3 = 6 moves.\n\nTo (5,9) is |5-5| + |4-9| = 0 + 5 = 5 moves.\n\nSo (5,9) is closer in terms of moves: 5 vs 6 to (2,7).\n\nBut (5,9) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together, so if I can get both, it's better.\n\nHowever, I need to get there without dying.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,9), I might be stuck at the top, but I can move down.\n\nBut let's see the board: from (5,9), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut for now, (5,9) is reachable in 5 moves, and since I'm at (5,4), moving UP gets me closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP now to (5,5) reduces distance to (5,9) to 4.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,4) reduces distance to (2,7) but increases to (5,9) slightly.\n\nBut I should decide on a target.\n\nLong-term strategy: collect multiple apples quickly to grow and have advantage.\n\nThe cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is attractive because I can potentially eat both in sequence.\n\n(5,9) is isolated.\n\nAlso, there might be new apples spawning, but I don't know the rules; I think apples stay until eaten, and new ones might spawn, but not specified.\n\nThe user didn't say anything about apple spawning, so probably fixed set until eaten.\n\nApples: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7) \u2013 five apples.\n\nEnemy might eat the ones at bottom.\n\nSo, I should go for the top ones.\n\nBut (5,9) is on the way to the top, but not directly.\n\nFrom (5,4), if I go UP multiple times to (5,9), I eat that apple, then I can head left towards (2,7) or (1,7).\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I grow, so my body becomes longer: head at (5,9), body at (5,8), (5,7), etc., down to (5,4) if I go straight up.\n\nBut I don't have to go straight; I can turn.\n\nBut let's compute moves.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5) now, distance to (5,9) is 4.\n\nThen from there, I can continue up to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 eat apple at (5,9) on the 5th move if I start from (5,4).\n\nThen after eating, my length increases, so I have head at (5,9), body at (5,8), tail at (5,7), etc., depending on my path.\n\nBut to reach the other apples at (1,7) or (2,7), from (5,9), it's |5-1| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves, or to (2,7) |5-2| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves.\n\nWhereas if I go towards (2,7) directly, from (5,4), min distance 6 moves as above.\n\nBut if I eat (5,9) first, I get one apple faster, but then I'm farther from the cluster.\n\nIf I go for the cluster, I might get two apples quickly.\n\nFor example, path to (2,7): from (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 that's 5 moves to reach (2,7), but I eat the apple at (2,7) on the 5th move.\n\nSimilarly, from there I can go to (1,7) easily.\n\nBut at (2,7), I eat apple, grow, then move to (1,7).\n\nNow, from (5,4), if I go LEFT to (4,4), then that's one move, and I'm closer.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5), then to reach (2,7), I need to go LEFT multiple times and UP, e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 5 moves from (5,4), but with UP first.\n\nSimilarly, with UP first to (5,5), distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5, same as from (4,4) |4-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut (5,9) is only 5 moves up, so I can get that apple in 5 moves, while to get to (2,7) it's 5 or 6 moves, but (2,7) has an apple too.\n\n(5,9) has an apple, so eating it gives me a point.\n\nIn terms of time to first apple: if I go UP now, I can get (5,9) in 4 more moves (since after this move, I need to move up 4 times to reach y=9 from y=5).\n\nFrom (5,4), after UP to (5,5), I am at (5,5), then to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 so 4 more moves to eat (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (2,7), from (5,4) after LEFT to (4,4), then to (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,7) \u2013 5 more moves to eat, or if I go directly, but it's longer.\n\nTo eat (2,7) in fewest moves: from (5,4) to (2,7) Manhattan 6, so minimum 6 moves if I don't have a direct path, but I can do it in 6 moves.\n\nFor example: LEFT to (4,4), LEFT to (3,4), UP to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 6 moves.\n\nOr shorter? |\u0394x| =3, |\u0394y|=3, min moves 6 since orthogonal.\n\n\u0394x=3, \u0394y=3, so min 6 moves, yes.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,7): need to decrease x by 3 and increase y by 3, so 6 moves.\n\nIf I go UP first to (5,5), then to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), LEFT to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 6 moves.\n\nWhereas to (5,9): from (5,4), move UP 5 times to (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(5,9) \u2013 5 moves total to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) can be eaten in 5 moves, (2,7) in 6 moves, so (5,9) is slightly faster to get the first apple.\n\nBut (2,7) is part of a cluster, so after eating one, I can eat the other nearby.\n\nAlso, the enemy is not a threat yet.\n\nAnother point: if I go for (5,9), I might be cornered at the top, but the board is open, so I can move left or right after.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), and it might grow if it eats an apple at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nFor example, if enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), then it can go to (1,0), then to (0,0) to eat apple, then it will grow and have a body.\n\nBut it's far from me.\n\nI think I should go for the closest apple or the cluster.\n\n(5,9) is vertically close; I can go straight up.\n\nMoving UP now to (5,5) is good for that.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,4), I am moving away from (5,9) but towards the cluster.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, and I can get it faster, I should do that.\n\nThen after eating, head to the cluster.\n\nBut the cluster might be eaten by no one; only enemy is at bottom, so it's safe.\n\nAlso, in the board, (1,7) and (2,7) are both there, so I can plan to get them after.\n\nBut let's see what move to make now.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nDOWN to (5,3) is bad because it moves me away from all apples, so not good.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT.\n\nUP: towards (5,9) and also generally up.\n\nLEFT: towards the left apples.\n\nSince (5,9) is directly reachable, and I can eat it in 4 moves after this, I think UP is better.\n\nIn my last move rationale, I moved LEFT to (5,4) from (6,4), so I was at (6,4) last turn, moved LEFT to (5,4).\n\nNow at (5,4), moving UP makes sense to go to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider that moving LEFT might open up more options, but UP is direct.\n\nAnother risk: if I go up, my body is at (6,4) and (7,4), so if I go up, I leave the row, and the tail will move when I move, so after moving UP to (5,5), my body will be at (5,4) and (6,4), tail at (7,4)? When I move, the head moves to new position, and the body follows, so the tail moves one step.\n\nAfter move UP to (5,5):\n- Head: (5,5)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (since the first body segment goes to where head was, and the next to where first was, so (6,4) becomes body, and (7,4) is gone? No.\n\nCurrent: head (5,4), body (6,4), tail (7,4)\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,5):\n- New head: (5,5)\n- The body segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was, (5,4)\n- The tail that was at (7,4) moves to where the first body was, (6,4)\n- So new body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (4,4):\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nNo immediate collision.\n\nBut back to decision.\n\nI think moving UP is fine.\n\nI could move LEFT to position myself to get both apples, but UP seems more direct for the vertical apple.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at the edge, so after eating, I might need to turn to avoid being trapped, but I can handle that later.\n\nFor now, UP to (5,5).\n\nThen next turn, I can continue UP to (5,6), and so on.\n\nTo reach the cluster, from (5,9), I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., but it will take more moves.\n\nBut eating (5,9) gives me a point now.\n\nWhereas if I go for the cluster, I get the first apple later but then a second quickly.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, I should eat it first.\n\nDistance to (5,9): 5 moves to eat.\n\nDistance to (2,7): 6 moves to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) is better for quick point.\n\nI am going with UP.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (2,1), it can move to (1,1) or (2,2), etc., not a threat.\n\nAlso, DOWN is bad.\n\nSo I think UP is the best move.\n on the current board state, I need to decide my next move to maximize points while avoiding collisions. Here's my analysis:\n\n- **My snake position**: Head at (5,4), body at [(6,4), (7,4)]. Valid moves from (5,4) are:\n  - UP to (5,5): empty\n  - DOWN to (5,3): empty\n  - LEFT to (4,4): empty\n  - RIGHT to (6,4): occupied by my body (invalid, collision risk).\n\n- **Apples**: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is a good target, but (5,9) is vertically closer to me (Manhattan distance 5 vs. 6 to (2,7)). Eating (5,9) first gives a quicker point, and I can then head toward the cluster.\n\n- **Enemy snake (ID 0)**: At (2,1) with no body. It's likely going for the bottom apples (e.g., (0,0) or (0,2)), so it's not an immediate threat to me.\n\n- **Move evaluation**:\n  - **DOWN (to (5,3))**: Moves me away from all apples (increases y-distance to targets), inefficient. Avoid.\n  - **LEFT (to (4,4))**: Reduces x-distance to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster but doesn't help with (5,9). It's viable but not optimal for the closest apple.\n  - **UP (to (5,5))**: Directly toward (5,9), reducing y-distance. This sets up a path to eat (5,9) in 4 more moves (e.g., UP to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)). After eating, I can turn left toward the cluster.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP to reach (5,9) efficiently. If the enemy grows or apples change, reassess path to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster.\n\nNext move: UP",

Last turn, I moved UP to (5,5) from (5,4), as per the rationale.\n\nNow, the board has changed:\n\n- My snake (ID:1):\n  - Head: (5,5)  (since I moved UP)\n  - Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (the first body segment moved to my previous head position, and the tail moved to the previous body position)\n\n- Enemy snake (ID:0) has moved. Since I don't see an updated position, I must infer based on rules. From the last state, enemy was at (3,1) with no body. But in the last board, it was at (2,1)? Let's check the initial input.\n\nUser says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (5,5) Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\" \u2013 so yes, I am now at (5,5).\n\nEnemy: \"Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\" \u2013 oh, it's at (3,1) now? In the initial description, it was at (3,1), but in the board visualization, it was at (2,1)? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nLooking back:\n\nUser message: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\"\n\nBut in the board state visualization:\n\n\"  1 . . . 0 . . . . . . \"  \u2013 row 1, which is y=1, and at x=3, it shows '0', so head at (3,1).\n\nIn the text: \"1 . . 0 . . . . . .\" \u2013 so x=3, y=1.\n\nPreviously it was at (2,1), but now it's (3,1), meaning it moved RIGHT from (2,1) to (3,1)? But that was last turn's board? No, this is the current state.\n\nThe user provided the current state after my move.\n\nApples are the same: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9 . . . . .

T T . . . \" \u2013 and earlier it says Body: [(5,4), (6,4)], so (5,4) and (6,4) are body segments, labeled T? But T usually means tail. In this board, (6,4) is the tail? Since my body is [(5,4), (6,4)], and (6,4) is the last segment, so it's the tail.\n\nIn the row:\n  4: positions: x=0 to 9: . . . . . T T . . . \nSo (5,4) and (6,4) are both 'T', meaning body or tail.\n\nBut for enemy, at (3,1), it's '0'.\n\nAnd apples: (0,2) is 'A' at row 2, (5,9) at row 9, (0,0) at row 0, (2,7) and (1,7) at row 7.\n\nCurrent board state:\n 9: . . . . .

From (5,5), moving UP to (5,6) reduces the distance to (5,9) to 3 moves.\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I can head towards the cluster at (1,7) and (2,7).\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), which is closer to the bottom apples: (0,0) and (0,2). It might move towards them.\n\nFor example, enemy can move LEFT to (2,1) to get closer to (0,0) or (0,2), or DOWN to (3,0), etc.\n\nBut not a direct threat to me.\n\nOther options: I could consider going for the cluster directly.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (2,7): |\u0394x|=3, |\u0394y|=2, Manhattan distance 5.\n\nPath: e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 5 moves.\n\nTo (5,9): |\u0394x|=0, |\u0394y|=4, so 4 moves up.\n\nSo (5,9) is still closer.\n\nMoving UP now is consistent with the plan.\n\nRIGHT to (6,5) might be possible, but it doesn't help much; it moves me away from both apples.\n\nLEFT to (4,5) is towards the cluster, but not directly up.\n\nSo UP seems best.\n\nBut let's think about body positions.\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,6):\n- New head: (5,6)\n- Body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  (the tail at (6,4) moves to (5,4)? Let's see.\n\nCurrent: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (6,4)\n\nAfter move UP to (5,6):\n- Head moves to (5,6)\n- The body segment at (5,4) moves to where head was, (5,5)\n- The tail at (6,4) moves to where the first body was, (5,4)\n- So new body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  \u2013 and tail at (5,4)? No: positions: head at (5,6), first body at (5,5), second body (tail) at (5,4)\n\nSince I have two body segments, the tail is now at (5,4).\n\nPreviously, (6,4) was tail, but it moves to (5,4) after the move.\n\n(5,4) was occupied by body, but after I move, the body segments shift.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, if I move UP, I am at (5,6), closer to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider the enemy's potential move.\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), with possible moves: UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0), LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (4,1).\n\nApples at (0,0) and (0,2) are tempting.\n\nFor example, enemy might move LEFT to (2,1) to head towards (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nBut again, not affecting me.\n\nI should stick to my plan.\n\nMove: UP\n\nThen next turn, if I can, continue UP.\n\nBut after two more UP moves, I will be at (5,7), then to (5,8), then (5,9) to eat apple.\n\nAt that point, I grow, so my length increases by one; I gain a point.\n\nThen, from there, I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., towards (2,7).\n\n(2,7) is at y=7, so from (5,9) to (2,7), I need to decrease x and decrease y.\n\nBut I can do that.\n\nNo need to change strategy now.\n\nSo, I will go UP.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

The apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and (1,7). My snake (ID 1) has its head at (5,7) with body segments at (5,6) and (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 0) is head-only at (2,0). The board is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n\nFrom my head position (5,7), I can move in four directions:\n- UP to (5,8)\n- DOWN to (5,6) - but that's my body segment, so collision with myself\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n- RIGHT to (6,7)\n\nSo invalid moves: DOWN (to my own body). Valid moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nObjective is to eat apples without dying. Apples near me:\n- (5,9) is two spaces up - if I go UP twice, I can reach it\n- (2,7) and (1,7) are to the left - (2,7) is three left, (1,7) is four left\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,0), far away with no body, so it's not an immediate threat. It might be heading for apples at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nPotential strategies:\n- Move UP toward (5,9) apple: This is efficient since it's close. After eating it, I grow to length 4. Then I can head left toward the cluster of apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n- Move LEFT toward the (2,7) and (1,7) apples: This gets me into a denser apple area faster, but (5,9) is closer and easier to reach first.\n- Move RIGHT: No apples directly that way, less optimal.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- UP: (5,8) is empty, then to (5,9) apple. Safe path.\n- LEFT: (4,7) is empty, then I can go to (3,7), (2,7) apple. Also safe as no threats nearby.\n- RIGHT: (6,7) is empty, but no apples in immediate vicinity, so inefficient.\n\nWhy not RIGHT? It doesn't lead to apples quickly. The nearest apples are left or up.\n\nConsidering last move: I moved UP last time (from (5,6) to (5,7)). Continuing UP makes sense to pursue (5,9).\n\nIf I go UP now to (5,8), next turn I can go UP again to (5,9) to eat the apple. Then I'll be at (5,9) with body [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].\n\nAfter that, I can turn left toward (2,7) or (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is valuable\u2014two apples close together.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,0): It's length 1, so it might eat (0,0) or (0,2) soon, but it doesn't affect me directly at this distance.\n\nNo other snakes or obstacles in my path. Walls aren't a concern here since I'm not near edges.\n\nBest move: UP to continue toward (5,9) apple. It's the most efficient point gain.\n\nFor next turn strategy: After eating (5,9), start moving left toward (2,7). But I'll reassess then based on apple positions and enemy.\n\nSo move: UP\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think> I need to make sure I'm thinking step by step and reasoning carefully about the game state.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10. My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5).

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there. Now, the next turn begins.\n- The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6) \u2192 but (9,6) was eaten in the last turn? No, the apples listed are current, so (9,6) is still there? Let me read carefully.\n\nUser says: \"Apples at: (0, 2), (5, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (9, 6)\" \u2013 this is the current state.

Eating it gains a point and I grow (body segment added at (9,5)).\n- DOWN: to (9,4) \u2013 empty.\n- LEFT: to (8,5) \u2013 empty (since I moved from there last turn).\n- RIGHT: Not possible, I'm at x=9, right edge; moving right would hit wall \u2192 death.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: RIGHT is invalid (x=10 is out of bounds).\n- Other snakes: Enemy at (2,4) is far away, no collision risk.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities:\n- Apple at (9,6) is adjacent and can be eaten immediately by moving UP.\n- Other apples: (8,2) is below, (5,9) top, etc., but (9,6) is closest.\n\nStrategy:\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is optimal: I eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

That means I just ate the apple at (9,6) in the last turn because my head moved to (9,6) and a body segment was added at my previous position (9,5). So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . .

My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

That was correct because I was aiming for the apple at (8,2).\n\nNow, looking at apples relative to my position:\n- (8,2) is directly below me at (8,3). Distance 1 down.\n- (0,2) is far left.\n- (5,9) top center.\n- (0,0) bottom left.\n- (2,7) top left.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,1), which is bottom center. It might be going for (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it.\n\nMy possible moves from head position (8,3):\n1. UP to (8,4): That's where my body is. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n2. DOWN to (8,2): That's the location of an apple. If I go there, I eat it and grow. My snake will then have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), and then (8,4) as tail.\n3. LEFT to (7,3): This moves me away from apples. No apple there.\n4. RIGHT to (9,3): Also no apple, and I'm moving right.\n\nThe apple at (8,2) is the closest and easiest to get. I should go for it. No reason to avoid it.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,1): It's 4 units away horizontally and 1 down. It would take at least 5 moves to reach me, so no immediate threat.\n- After eating the apple, I'll be at (8,2). Then I can plan next moves\u2014possibly toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n\nStrategy:\n- Short-term: Eat the apple at (8,2) now.\n- After that, I'll have a longer snake: head (8,2), body (8,3), tail (8,4). Then I can choose a direction to go next\u2014perhaps LEFT to (7,2) to head toward (2,7) or (0,2), but (2,7) is closer.\n\nFor this turn, DOWN to (8,2) is the best move. It gets me a point and grows my snake.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think> For now, I am just thinking internally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the board. My snake (ID 1) has its head at (8,2) and body segments at [(8,3), (8,4)]. That means I just ate an apple at (8,2) on the last move, since my head was at (8,3) and I moved DOWN to (8,2). So now I've grown, and my body includes that new segment.\n\nThe apples currently on the board are: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). Wait, in the board state diagram, I see A's at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and also (1,7) is listed. But in the initial list, (1,7) is included. Looking at the board:\n\n- Row 9: A at (5,9)\n- Row 7: A at (2,7) and (1,7) \u2013 so two apples there? The diagram shows \"A A\" at y=7, x=1 and x=2.\n- Row 2: A at (0,2)\n- Row 0: A at (0,0)\n\nAnd my head is at (8,2), with body at (8,3) and (8,4).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (3,1) with no body. It must have just started too.\n\nNow, possible moves from my current head (8,2):\n\n- UP to (8,3): That's my body segment. If I go there, I collide with myself and die. Invalid.\n- DOWN to (8,1): This is empty. No apple there.\n- LEFT to (7,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Valid, within board bounds.\n\nApples are at (0,2), (0,0), (1,7), (2,7), (5,9). The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Enemy has only 1 segment.\n- Best apple targets: The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is ideal for efficient growth. They are 3 steps away horizontally and 3 vertically from my head (7,4).\n- Immediate danger: Moving DOWN would kill me, so it's not an option. Right now, no direct threat from enemy since it's far away at (1,0).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- UP (to (7,5)): Moves me toward row 7 apples, but vertically. From (7,5), I'd still need to go left to reach apples. Safe.\n- LEFT (to (6,4)): Directly reduces distance to (1,7)/(2,7). From (6,4), I can go UP then LEFT.

Since apples are at x=1-2, moving left is more direct.\n- After LEFT, I can go UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), etc., toward the cluster.\n- UP first would require more left movements later.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,0) will likely eat the apple at (0,0) or (0,2) next turn, growing to 2 segments. But it won't threaten me immediately as it's far.\n\nLong-term:\n- I should head toward the apple cluster. Eating one apple there gives me growth and another apple adjacent for potential double-score.\n- Avoid the bottom where enemy is.\n\nDecision: LEFT is better than UP for reducing distance to the target apples more efficiently.

That leaves UP, DOWN, and LEFT as safe moves.\n\nNow, apples to consider:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (1,1). Enemy will likely go for these.\n- (5,9) is far away and inefficient to reach.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are the best targets - close and clustered for potential multi-apple gains.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,1) can move UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0) (apple there), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1). Since (1,0) has an apple, it might go DOWN to eat it and grow. If it does, it will have a body segment next turn, becoming more dangerous.\n\nMy strategy:\n- Head toward the apple cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) efficiently.\n- Minimize risk from the enemy, which is still distant.\n- Avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nDistance to apple cluster:\n- From (6,4) to (1,7): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- I need to reduce both x and y differences.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (to (6,5)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=2 - improves y-distance\n- DOWN (to (6,3)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=4 - worse, moving away\n- LEFT (to (5,4)): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3 - improves x-distance\n\nComparing:\n- UP: Gets me closer vertically to the apples, but horizontally same.\n- LEFT: Gets me closer horizontally, vertically same.\n- The apples are at y=7, so I need to go UP eventually. But moving LEFT first might set up a better path.\n\nPath efficiency:\n- After LEFT to (5,4), I could go UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc. - this is a diagonal approach.\n- After UP to (6,5), I could go LEFT to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n- Both have similar steps, but LEFT immediately reduces the x-distance, which is larger (5 vs 3 in y).\n\nOther considerations:\n- The enemy might be heading toward the bottom apples, so the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer targets for now.\n- No immediate threats, so I can prioritize apple collection.\n\nDecision:\n- LEFT to (5,4) is the best move to reduce distance to the apple cluster.\n- DOWN is inefficient since it moves me away from the target.\n- UP is okay but not as good as LEFT for reducing the larger x-gap.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7) by moving UP or further LEFT, depending on position.\nFinal move: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right.\n\nApples are at: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nMy snake (ID:1) is:\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(6,4), (7,4)]\n\nEnemy snake (ID:0) is:\n- Head: (2,1)\n- Body: none (so it's just a single segment)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9: . . . . . A . . . .   (A at (5,9))\n  8: . . . . . . . . . .\n  7: . A A . . . . . . .   (A at (1,7) and (2,7))\n  6: . . . . . . . . . .\n  5: . . . . . . . . . .\n  4: . . . . . 1 H T . .

(Enemy head at (2,1))\n  0: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,0))\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nIn the board, (5,4) is my head, (6,4) is the first body segment (H for body?), and (7,4) is the tail (T). The enemy is at (2,1).\n\nPossible moves from my head at (5,4):\n- UP: to (5,5)\n- DOWN: to (5,3)\n- LEFT: to (4,4)\n- RIGHT: to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is occupied by my body, so RIGHT is not safe - I would collide with myself. Similarly, moving into walls or the enemy would be bad, but here positions seem ok.\n\nSo valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, apples:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (2,1). Enemy can move to them easily.\n- (5,9) is at the top, far from me and the enemy.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are clustered at the top-left, which might be a good target for me.\n\nI should aim to get apples efficiently while avoiding risks.\n\nDistance from my head (5,4) to key points:\n- To apple (1,7): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (2,7): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (5,9): \u0394x=0, \u0394y=5 - very close vertically but y=9 is far.\n\n(5,9) is directly above me, but at y=9, while I'm at y=4. So it would take 5 moves up to reach it, but since I need to grow, it might be an option. However, (1,7) and (2,7) are closer if I move diagonally.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is 2 units right and 3 units down from (0,0) and (0,2). It can move towards them.\n\nEnemy possible moves:\n- From (2,1):\n  - UP: to (2,2) - empty\n  - DOWN: to (2,0) - empty? (0,0) is apple, but (2,0) is empty, (1,0) is empty? Board shows row 0: A at (0,0), so (2,0) is empty.\n  - LEFT: to (1,1) - empty\n  - RIGHT: to (3,1) - empty\n\nEnemy might go for (0,0) or (0,2), so it might move LEFT to (1,1), then to (0,1), etc., or DOWN to (2,0) to get closer to (0,0).\n\nBut since (0,0) and (0,2) are apples, it will likely head that way.\n\nFor me, the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer and closer in terms of steps.\n\nMy best move to head towards (1,7) or (2,7):\n- From (5,4), I need to reduce x and increase y.\n- UP: to (5,5) - increases y, same x, so closer in y but not x\n- LEFT: to (4,4) - decreases x, same y, so closer in x but not y\n- DOWN: to (5,3) - decreases y, worse\n\nSo UP or LEFT are both reasonable.\n\nSince the apples are at x=1 or 2 and y=7, I need to decrease x more than increase y currently (\u0394x=4 or 3 vs \u0394y=3). So moving LEFT to reduce x might be better.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,4), I can then go UP to (4,5), and so on.\n\nMoving UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n\nBoth paths have similar number of steps.\n\nBut there might be a risk if the enemy comes up, but it's far away.\n\nAnother idea: the apple at (5,9) is directly above. If I go UP multiple times, I can get it. From (5,4) to (5,9) is 5 moves up. After eating, I grow, so I become longer.\n\nBut (1,7) is only 4 moves if I go left and up efficiently (e.g., LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP to reach (3,6), etc., but to (1,7) from (5,4): min steps 4? \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3, so min 4 moves if diagonal, but since moves are orthogonal, Manhattan distance is 7, so it takes 7 moves to reach exactly, but I can eat on the way or something.\n\nManhattan distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |4-7| = 3 + 3 = 6 moves.\n\nTo (5,9) is |5-5| + |4-9| = 0 + 5 = 5 moves.\n\nSo (5,9) is closer in terms of moves: 5 vs 6 to (2,7).\n\nBut (5,9) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together, so if I can get both, it's better.\n\nHowever, I need to get there without dying.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,9), I might be stuck at the top, but I can move down.\n\nBut let's see the board: from (5,9), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut for now, (5,9) is reachable in 5 moves, and since I'm at (5,4), moving UP gets me closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP now to (5,5) reduces distance to (5,9) to 4.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,4) reduces distance to (2,7) but increases to (5,9) slightly.\n\nBut I should decide on a target.\n\nLong-term strategy: collect multiple apples quickly to grow and have advantage.\n\nThe cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is attractive because I can potentially eat both in sequence.\n\n(5,9) is isolated.\n\nAlso, there might be new apples spawning, but I don't know the rules; I think apples stay until eaten, and new ones might spawn, but not specified.\n\nThe user didn't say anything about apple spawning, so probably fixed set until eaten.\n\nApples: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7) \u2013 five apples.\n\nEnemy might eat the ones at bottom.\n\nSo, I should go for the top ones.\n\nBut (5,9) is on the way to the top, but not directly.\n\nFrom (5,4), if I go UP multiple times to (5,9), I eat that apple, then I can head left towards (2,7) or (1,7).\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I grow, so my body becomes longer: head at (5,9), body at (5,8), (5,7), etc., down to (5,4) if I go straight up.\n\nBut I don't have to go straight; I can turn.\n\nBut let's compute moves.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5) now, distance to (5,9) is 4.\n\nThen from there, I can continue up to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 eat apple at (5,9) on the 5th move if I start from (5,4).\n\nThen after eating, my length increases, so I have head at (5,9), body at (5,8), tail at (5,7), etc., depending on my path.\n\nBut to reach the other apples at (1,7) or (2,7), from (5,9), it's |5-1| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves, or to (2,7) |5-2| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves.\n\nWhereas if I go towards (2,7) directly, from (5,4), min distance 6 moves as above.\n\nBut if I eat (5,9) first, I get one apple faster, but then I'm farther from the cluster.\n\nIf I go for the cluster, I might get two apples quickly.\n\nFor example, path to (2,7): from (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 that's 5 moves to reach (2,7), but I eat the apple at (2,7) on the 5th move.\n\nSimilarly, from there I can go to (1,7) easily.\n\nBut at (2,7), I eat apple, grow, then move to (1,7).\n\nNow, from (5,4), if I go LEFT to (4,4), then that's one move, and I'm closer.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5), then to reach (2,7), I need to go LEFT multiple times and UP, e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 5 moves from (5,4), but with UP first.\n\nSimilarly, with UP first to (5,5), distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5, same as from (4,4) |4-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut (5,9) is only 5 moves up, so I can get that apple in 5 moves, while to get to (2,7) it's 5 or 6 moves, but (2,7) has an apple too.\n\n(5,9) has an apple, so eating it gives me a point.\n\nIn terms of time to first apple: if I go UP now, I can get (5,9) in 4 more moves (since after this move, I need to move up 4 times to reach y=9 from y=5).\n\nFrom (5,4), after UP to (5,5), I am at (5,5), then to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 so 4 more moves to eat (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (2,7), from (5,4) after LEFT to (4,4), then to (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,7) \u2013 5 more moves to eat, or if I go directly, but it's longer.\n\nTo eat (2,7) in fewest moves: from (5,4) to (2,7) Manhattan 6, so minimum 6 moves if I don't have a direct path, but I can do it in 6 moves.\n\nFor example: LEFT to (4,4), LEFT to (3,4), UP to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 6 moves.\n\nOr shorter? |\u0394x| =3, |\u0394y|=3, min moves 6 since orthogonal.\n\n\u0394x=3, \u0394y=3, so min 6 moves, yes.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,7): need to decrease x by 3 and increase y by 3, so 6 moves.\n\nIf I go UP first to (5,5), then to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), LEFT to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 6 moves.\n\nWhereas to (5,9): from (5,4), move UP 5 times to (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(5,9) \u2013 5 moves total to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) can be eaten in 5 moves, (2,7) in 6 moves, so (5,9) is slightly faster to get the first apple.\n\nBut (2,7) is part of a cluster, so after eating one, I can eat the other nearby.\n\nAlso, the enemy is not a threat yet.\n\nAnother point: if I go for (5,9), I might be cornered at the top, but the board is open, so I can move left or right after.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), and it might grow if it eats an apple at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nFor example, if enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), then it can go to (1,0), then to (0,0) to eat apple, then it will grow and have a body.\n\nBut it's far from me.\n\nI think I should go for the closest apple or the cluster.\n\n(5,9) is vertically close; I can go straight up.\n\nMoving UP now to (5,5) is good for that.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,4), I am moving away from (5,9) but towards the cluster.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, and I can get it faster, I should do that.\n\nThen after eating, head to the cluster.\n\nBut the cluster might be eaten by no one; only enemy is at bottom, so it's safe.\n\nAlso, in the board, (1,7) and (2,7) are both there, so I can plan to get them after.\n\nBut let's see what move to make now.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nDOWN to (5,3) is bad because it moves me away from all apples, so not good.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT.\n\nUP: towards (5,9) and also generally up.\n\nLEFT: towards the left apples.\n\nSince (5,9) is directly reachable, and I can eat it in 4 moves after this, I think UP is better.\n\nIn my last move rationale, I moved LEFT to (5,4) from (6,4), so I was at (6,4) last turn, moved LEFT to (5,4).\n\nNow at (5,4), moving UP makes sense to go to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider that moving LEFT might open up more options, but UP is direct.\n\nAnother risk: if I go up, my body is at (6,4) and (7,4), so if I go up, I leave the row, and the tail will move when I move, so after moving UP to (5,5), my body will be at (5,4) and (6,4), tail at (7,4)? When I move, the head moves to new position, and the body follows, so the tail moves one step.\n\nAfter move UP to (5,5):\n- Head: (5,5)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (since the first body segment goes to where head was, and the next to where first was, so (6,4) becomes body, and (7,4) is gone? No.\n\nCurrent: head (5,4), body (6,4), tail (7,4)\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,5):\n- New head: (5,5)\n- The body segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was, (5,4)\n- The tail that was at (7,4) moves to where the first body was, (6,4)\n- So new body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (4,4):\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nNo immediate collision.\n\nBut back to decision.\n\nI think moving UP is fine.\n\nI could move LEFT to position myself to get both apples, but UP seems more direct for the vertical apple.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at the edge, so after eating, I might need to turn to avoid being trapped, but I can handle that later.\n\nFor now, UP to (5,5).\n\nThen next turn, I can continue UP to (5,6), and so on.\n\nTo reach the cluster, from (5,9), I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., but it will take more moves.\n\nBut eating (5,9) gives me a point now.\n\nWhereas if I go for the cluster, I get the first apple later but then a second quickly.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, I should eat it first.\n\nDistance to (5,9): 5 moves to eat.\n\nDistance to (2,7): 6 moves to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) is better for quick point.\n\nI am going with UP.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (2,1), it can move to (1,1) or (2,2), etc., not a threat.\n\nAlso, DOWN is bad.\n\nSo I think UP is the best move.\n on the current board state, I need to decide my next move to maximize points while avoiding collisions. Here's my analysis:\n\n- **My snake position**: Head at (5,4), body at [(6,4), (7,4)]. Valid moves from (5,4) are:\n  - UP to (5,5): empty\n  - DOWN to (5,3): empty\n  - LEFT to (4,4): empty\n  - RIGHT to (6,4): occupied by my body (invalid, collision risk).\n\n- **Apples**: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is a good target, but (5,9) is vertically closer to me (Manhattan distance 5 vs. 6 to (2,7)). Eating (5,9) first gives a quicker point, and I can then head toward the cluster.\n\n- **Enemy snake (ID 0)**: At (2,1) with no body. It's likely going for the bottom apples (e.g., (0,0) or (0,2)), so it's not an immediate threat to me.\n\n- **Move evaluation**:\n  - **DOWN (to (5,3))**: Moves me away from all apples (increases y-distance to targets), inefficient. Avoid.\n  - **LEFT (to (4,4))**: Reduces x-distance to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster but doesn't help with (5,9). It's viable but not optimal for the closest apple.\n  - **UP (to (5,5))**: Directly toward (5,9), reducing y-distance. This sets up a path to eat (5,9) in 4 more moves (e.g., UP to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)). After eating, I can turn left toward the cluster.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP to reach (5,9) efficiently. If the enemy grows or apples change, reassess path to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster.\n\nNext move: UP",

Last turn, I moved UP to (5,5) from (5,4), as per the rationale.\n\nNow, the board has changed:\n\n- My snake (ID:1):\n  - Head: (5,5)  (since I moved UP)\n  - Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (the first body segment moved to my previous head position, and the tail moved to the previous body position)\n\n- Enemy snake (ID:0) has moved. Since I don't see an updated position, I must infer based on rules. From the last state, enemy was at (3,1) with no body. But in the last board, it was at (2,1)? Let's check the initial input.\n\nUser says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (5,5) Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\" \u2013 so yes, I am now at (5,5).\n\nEnemy: \"Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\" \u2013 oh, it's at (3,1) now? In the initial description, it was at (3,1), but in the board visualization, it was at (2,1)? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nLooking back:\n\nUser message: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\"\n\nBut in the board state visualization:\n\n\"  1 . . . 0 . . . . . . \"  \u2013 row 1, which is y=1, and at x=3, it shows '0', so head at (3,1).\n\nIn the text: \"1 . . 0 . . . . . .\" \u2013 so x=3, y=1.\n\nPreviously it was at (2,1), but now it's (3,1), meaning it moved RIGHT from (2,1) to (3,1)? But that was last turn's board? No, this is the current state.\n\nThe user provided the current state after my move.\n\nApples are the same: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9 . . . . . A . . . .\n  8 . . . . . . . . . .\n  7 . A A . . . . . . .\n  6 . . . . . . . . . .\n  5 . . . . . 1 . . . .   (my head at (5,5))\n  4 . . . . . T T . . .   (T at (5,4) and (6,4)? But body segments are T for tail? In the board, it says \"T\" for body? Let's read.\n\n\"  4 . . . . . T T . . . \" \u2013 and earlier it says Body: [(5,4), (6,4)], so (5,4) and (6,4) are body segments, labeled T? But T usually means tail. In this board, (6,4) is the tail? Since my body is [(5,4), (6,4)], and (6,4) is the last segment, so it's the tail.\n\nIn the row:\n  4: positions: x=0 to 9: . . . . . T T . . . \nSo (5,4) and (6,4) are both 'T', meaning body or tail.\n\nBut for enemy, at (3,1), it's '0'.\n\nAnd apples: (0,2) is 'A' at row 2, (5,9) at row 9, (0,0) at row 0, (2,7) and (1,7) at row 7.\n\nCurrent board state:\n 9: . . . . . A . . . .   (A at (5,9))\n 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n 7: . A A . . . . . . .   (A at (1,7) and (2,7))\n 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n 5: . . . . . 1 . . . .   (my head at (5,5))\n 4: . . . . . T T . . .   (body at (5,4) and (6,4) \u2013 (5,4) is the segment just behind head, (6,4) is tail)\n 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n 2: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,2))\n 1: . . . 0 . . . . . .   (enemy head at (3,1))\n 0: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,0))\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my head is at (5,5), and I have body at (5,4) and tail at (6,4).\n\nEnemy at (3,1) with no body.\n\nNow, possible moves for me from (5,5):\n- UP: to (5,6) \u2013 empty\n- DOWN: to (5,4) \u2013 occupied by my body (first segment), so COLLISION, invalid\n- LEFT: to (4,5) \u2013 empty\n- RIGHT: to (6,5) \u2013 empty\n\nSo valid moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nDOWN is invalid because (5,4) is my body.\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go.\n\nStrategy: Continue towards the apple at (5,9), as per last turn's plan.\n\nApple at (5,9) is directly above. From (5,5), moving UP to (5,6) reduces the distance to (5,9) to 3 moves.\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I can head towards the cluster at (1,7) and (2,7).\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), which is closer to the bottom apples: (0,0) and (0,2). It might move towards them.\n\nFor example, enemy can move LEFT to (2,1) to get closer to (0,0) or (0,2), or DOWN to (3,0), etc.\n\nBut not a direct threat to me.\n\nOther options: I could consider going for the cluster directly.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (2,7): |\u0394x|=3, |\u0394y|=2, Manhattan distance 5.\n\nPath: e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 5 moves.\n\nTo (5,9): |\u0394x|=0, |\u0394y|=4, so 4 moves up.\n\nSo (5,9) is still closer.\n\nMoving UP now is consistent with the plan.\n\nRIGHT to (6,5) might be possible, but it doesn't help much; it moves me away from both apples.\n\nLEFT to (4,5) is towards the cluster, but not directly up.\n\nSo UP seems best.\n\nBut let's think about body positions.\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,6):\n- New head: (5,6)\n- Body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  (the tail at (6,4) moves to (5,4)? Let's see.\n\nCurrent: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (6,4)\n\nAfter move UP to (5,6):\n- Head moves to (5,6)\n- The body segment at (5,4) moves to where head was, (5,5)\n- The tail at (6,4) moves to where the first body was, (5,4)\n- So new body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  \u2013 and tail at (5,4)? No: positions: head at (5,6), first body at (5,5), second body (tail) at (5,4)\n\nSince I have two body segments, the tail is now at (5,4).\n\nPreviously, (6,4) was tail, but it moves to (5,4) after the move.\n\n(5,4) was occupied by body, but after I move, the body segments shift.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, if I move UP, I am at (5,6), closer to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider the enemy's potential move.\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), with possible moves: UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0), LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (4,1).\n\nApples at (0,0) and (0,2) are tempting.\n\nFor example, enemy might move LEFT to (2,1) to head towards (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nBut again, not affecting me.\n\nI should stick to my plan.\n\nMove: UP\n\nThen next turn, if I can, continue UP.\n\nBut after two more UP moves, I will be at (5,7), then to (5,8), then (5,9) to eat apple.\n\nAt that point, I grow, so my length increases by one; I gain a point.\n\nThen, from there, I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., towards (2,7).\n\n(2,7) is at y=7, so from (5,9) to (2,7), I need to decrease x and decrease y.\n\nBut I can do that.\n\nNo need to change strategy now.\n\nSo, I will go UP.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

Moving UP repeatedly is the shortest path (3 moves: (5,6)\u2192(5,7)\u2192(5,8)\u2192(5,9)). \n- The enemy snake at (3,1) is distant and likely targeting apples at (0,0) or (0,2).

The apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and (1,7). My snake (ID 1) has its head at (5,7) with body segments at (5,6) and (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 0) is head-only at (2,0). The board is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n\nFrom my head position (5,7), I can move in four directions:\n- UP to (5,8)\n- DOWN to (5,6) - but that's my body segment, so collision with myself\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n- RIGHT to (6,7)\n\nSo invalid moves: DOWN (to my own body). Valid moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nObjective is to eat apples without dying. Apples near me:\n- (5,9) is two spaces up - if I go UP twice, I can reach it\n- (2,7) and (1,7) are to the left - (2,7) is three left, (1,7) is four left\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,0), far away with no body, so it's not an immediate threat. It might be heading for apples at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nPotential strategies:\n- Move UP toward (5,9) apple: This is efficient since it's close. After eating it, I grow to length 4. Then I can head left toward the cluster of apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n- Move LEFT toward the (2,7) and (1,7) apples: This gets me into a denser apple area faster, but (5,9) is closer and easier to reach first.\n- Move RIGHT: No apples directly that way, less optimal.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- UP: (5,8) is empty, then to (5,9) apple. Safe path.\n- LEFT: (4,7) is empty, then I can go to (3,7), (2,7) apple. Also safe as no threats nearby.\n- RIGHT: (6,7) is empty, but no apples in immediate vicinity, so inefficient.\n\nWhy not RIGHT? It doesn't lead to apples quickly. The nearest apples are left or up.\n\nConsidering last move: I moved UP last time (from (5,6) to (5,7)). Continuing UP makes sense to pursue (5,9).\n\nIf I go UP now to (5,8), next turn I can go UP again to (5,9) to eat the apple. Then I'll be at (5,9) with body [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].\n\nAfter that, I can turn left toward (2,7) or (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is valuable\u2014two apples close together.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,0): It's length 1, so it might eat (0,0) or (0,2) soon, but it doesn't affect me directly at this distance.\n\nNo other snakes or obstacles in my path. Walls aren't a concern here since I'm not near edges.\n\nBest move: UP to continue toward (5,9) apple. It's the most efficient point gain.\n\nFor next turn strategy: After eating (5,9), start moving left toward (2,7). But I'll reassess then based on apple positions and enemy.\n\nSo move: UP\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

From head position (5,8), possible moves are:\n- **UP** to (5,9): There's an apple there! Eating it would grow me to length 4.\n- **DOWN** to (5,7): But that's my own body segment\u2014collision, so death. Invalid move.\n- **LEFT** to (4,8): Empty space.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,8): Also empty.\n\nSo valid moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy considerations**:\n- **UP to (5,9)**: This is highly appealing because it's an immediate apple. Eating it would give me a point and grow my snake. Since I just moved up last turn (from (5,7) to (5,8)), continuing up makes sense for efficiency. After eating, my head would be at (5,9), and my body would be [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].\n- **LEFT to (4,8)**: This moves me toward the cluster of apples at (2,7) and (1,7). From (4,8), I could go down to (4,7) next turn, then left to (3,7), and so on. However, (5,9) is closer and easier to grab first.\n- **RIGHT to (6,8)**: Less optimal. There are no apples nearby in that direction, and it would take me away from the denser apple areas. Only worth it if other moves are risky, but they're not.\n- **Enemy threat**: Snake #0 is at (1,0)\u2014far away and probably heading for (0,0) or (0,2). It has no body yet, so it's weak and slow. I don't need to worry about it for now.\n- **Risk of collision**: Only with myself, and DOWN is blocked. Other paths are clear.\n\n**Why UP is best**:\n1. **Proximity**: (5,9) is one move away. Eating it gives instant reward.\n2. **Growth**: With length 4, I'll be more resilient and can chase other apples aggressively.\n3. **Efficiency**: After eating, I can easily turn toward the left-side apples (e.g., from (5,9), go LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc.).\n4. **No downsides**: The path is safe\u2014no walls, snakes, or self-collision.\n\n**Alternative thoughts**:\n- If I go LEFT now, I might reach (2,7) faster, but it would take at least 3 moves (e.g., LEFT to (4,8), DOWN to (4,7), LEFT to (3,7), LEFT to (2,7)) versus just one move for (5,9). Prioritizing the closest apple is smarter.\n- RIGHT is wasteful\u2014no gain and delays eating.\n\n**For next turn strategy**:\n- After eating (5,9), I'll reassess apple positions. Likely head left toward (2,7) or (1,7). If the enemy snake grows, I'll need to monitor it, but it's low risk for now.\n\nFinal decision: Move UP to claim the apple at (5,9).\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

My snake is at (8,5) with no body, so just the head. There's an enemy snake at (2,5) also with no body. Apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), and (9,6).\n\nI need to choose a direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

Wait no, let's confirm the state). \n- From the user message: After my last move RIGHT to (9,5), I should have moved there.

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

So now I have a body segment behind me.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) - bottom left\n- (5,9) - top middle\n- (8,2) - bottom right\n- (0,0) - bottom left corner\n- (9,6) was just eaten, so it's gone now\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,3) with no body. The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . . T  -> T should be my tail? Body at (9,5)\n4: . . . . . . . . . .\n3: . . 0 . . . . . . .  -> enemy head at (2,3)\n2: A . . . . . . . A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1.

LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Possible enemy moves would be toward apples or away, but I need to focus on my own safety and scoring.\n\nApples are:\n- (0,2) - close to enemy\n- (0,0) - very close to enemy (adjacent left)\n- (5,9) - far top-right\n- (1,7) and (2,7) - top-left cluster\n\nMy strategy:\n- I have 3 segments (head + 2 body parts). Enemy has only 1 segment.\n- Best apple targets: The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is ideal for efficient growth. They are 3 steps away horizontally and 3 vertically from my head (7,4).\n- Immediate danger: Moving DOWN would kill me, so it's not an option. Right now, no direct threat from enemy since it's far away at (1,0).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- UP (to (7,5)): Moves me toward row 7 apples, but vertically. From (7,5), I'd still need to go left to reach apples. Safe.\n- LEFT (to (6,4)): Directly reduces distance to (1,7)/(2,7). From (6,4), I can go UP then LEFT. Also safe.\n- RIGHT (to (8,4)): Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient. Avoid.\n- DOWN: Suicide, discarded.\n\nComparing UP vs LEFT:\n- Distance to closest apple (1,7): \n  - From (7,4): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=3\n  - UP to (7,5): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=2\n  - LEFT to (6,4): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- LEFT reduces the x-distance more significantly (1 unit vs UP reducing y by 1). Since apples are at x=1-2, moving left is more direct.\n- After LEFT, I can go UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), etc., toward the cluster.\n- UP first would require more left movements later.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,0) will likely eat the apple at (0,0) or (0,2) next turn, growing to 2 segments. But it won't threaten me immediately as it's far.\n\nLong-term:\n- I should head toward the apple cluster. Eating one apple there gives me growth and another apple adjacent for potential double-score.\n- Avoid the bottom where enemy is.\n\nDecision: LEFT is better than UP for reducing distance to the target apples more efficiently. RIGHT is wasteful.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7)/(2,7) via UP or further LEFT after moving to (6,4).\n\nFinal move: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Enemy will likely go for these.\n- (5,9) is far away and inefficient to reach.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are the best targets - close and clustered for potential multi-apple gains.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,1) can move UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0) (apple there), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1). Since (1,0) has an apple, it might go DOWN to eat it and grow. If it does, it will have a body segment next turn, becoming more dangerous.\n\nMy strategy:\n- Head toward the apple cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) efficiently.\n- Minimize risk from the enemy, which is still distant.\n- Avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nDistance to apple cluster:\n- From (6,4) to (1,7): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- I need to reduce both x and y differences.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (to (6,5)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=2 - improves y-distance\n- DOWN (to (6,3)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=4 - worse, moving away\n- LEFT (to (5,4)): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3 - improves x-distance\n\nComparing:\n- UP: Gets me closer vertically to the apples, but horizontally same.\n- LEFT: Gets me closer horizontally, vertically same.\n- The apples are at y=7, so I need to go UP eventually.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right.\n\nApples are at: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nMy snake (ID:1) is:\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(6,4), (7,4)]\n\nEnemy snake (ID:0) is:\n- Head: (2,1)\n- Body: none (so it's just a single segment)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9: . . . . . A . . . .   (A at (5,9))\n  8: . . . . . . . . . .\n  7: . A A . . . . . . .   (A at (1,7) and (2,7))\n  6: . . . . . . . . . .\n  5: . . . . . . . . . .\n  4: . . . . . 1 H T . .   (My head at (5,4), body at (6,4) and (7,4) - so (6,4) is body, (7,4) is tail)\n  3: . . . . . . . . . .\n  2: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,2))\n  1: . . 0 . . . . . . .   (Enemy head at (2,1))\n  0: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,0))\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nIn the board, (5,4) is my head, (6,4) is the first body segment (H for body?), and (7,4) is the tail (T). The enemy is at (2,1).\n\nPossible moves from my head at (5,4):\n- UP: to (5,5)\n- DOWN: to (5,3)\n- LEFT: to (4,4)\n- RIGHT: to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is occupied by my body, so RIGHT is not safe - I would collide with myself. Similarly, moving into walls or the enemy would be bad, but here positions seem ok.\n\nSo valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, apples:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (2,1). Enemy can move to them easily.\n- (5,9) is at the top, far from me and the enemy.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are clustered at the top-left, which might be a good target for me.\n\nI should aim to get apples efficiently while avoiding risks.\n\nDistance from my head (5,4) to key points:\n- To apple (1,7): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (2,7): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (5,9): \u0394x=0, \u0394y=5 - very close vertically but y=9 is far.\n\n(5,9) is directly above me, but at y=9, while I'm at y=4. So it would take 5 moves up to reach it, but since I need to grow, it might be an option. However, (1,7) and (2,7) are closer if I move diagonally.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is 2 units right and 3 units down from (0,0) and (0,2). It can move towards them.\n\nEnemy possible moves:\n- From (2,1):\n  - UP: to (2,2) - empty\n  - DOWN: to (2,0) - empty? (0,0) is apple, but (2,0) is empty, (1,0) is empty? Board shows row 0: A at (0,0), so (2,0) is empty.\n  - LEFT: to (1,1) - empty\n  - RIGHT: to (3,1) - empty\n\nEnemy might go for (0,0) or (0,2), so it might move LEFT to (1,1), then to (0,1), etc., or DOWN to (2,0) to get closer to (0,0).\n\nBut since (0,0) and (0,2) are apples, it will likely head that way.\n\nFor me, the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer and closer in terms of steps.\n\nMy best move to head towards (1,7) or (2,7):\n- From (5,4), I need to reduce x and increase y.\n- UP: to (5,5) - increases y, same x, so closer in y but not x\n- LEFT: to (4,4) - decreases x, same y, so closer in x but not y\n- DOWN: to (5,3) - decreases y, worse\n\nSo UP or LEFT are both reasonable.\n\nSince the apples are at x=1 or 2 and y=7, I need to decrease x more than increase y currently (\u0394x=4 or 3 vs \u0394y=3). So moving LEFT to reduce x might be better.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,4), I can then go UP to (4,5), and so on.\n\nMoving UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n\nBoth paths have similar number of steps.\n\nBut there might be a risk if the enemy comes up, but it's far away.\n\nAnother idea: the apple at (5,9) is directly above. If I go UP multiple times, I can get it. From (5,4) to (5,9) is 5 moves up. After eating, I grow, so I become longer.\n\nBut (1,7) is only 4 moves if I go left and up efficiently (e.g., LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP to reach (3,6), etc., but to (1,7) from (5,4): min steps 4? \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3, so min 4 moves if diagonal, but since moves are orthogonal, Manhattan distance is 7, so it takes 7 moves to reach exactly, but I can eat on the way or something.\n\nManhattan distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |4-7| = 3 + 3 = 6 moves.\n\nTo (5,9) is |5-5| + |4-9| = 0 + 5 = 5 moves.\n\nSo (5,9) is closer in terms of moves: 5 vs 6 to (2,7).\n\nBut (5,9) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together, so if I can get both, it's better.\n\nHowever, I need to get there without dying.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,9), I might be stuck at the top, but I can move down.\n\nBut let's see the board: from (5,9), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut for now, (5,9) is reachable in 5 moves, and since I'm at (5,4), moving UP gets me closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP now to (5,5) reduces distance to (5,9) to 4.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,4) reduces distance to (2,7) but increases to (5,9) slightly.\n\nBut I should decide on a target.\n\nLong-term strategy: collect multiple apples quickly to grow and have advantage.\n\nThe cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is attractive because I can potentially eat both in sequence.\n\n(5,9) is isolated.\n\nAlso, there might be new apples spawning, but I don't know the rules; I think apples stay until eaten, and new ones might spawn, but not specified.\n\nThe user didn't say anything about apple spawning, so probably fixed set until eaten.\n\nApples: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7) \u2013 five apples.\n\nEnemy might eat the ones at bottom.\n\nSo, I should go for the top ones.\n\nBut (5,9) is on the way to the top, but not directly.\n\nFrom (5,4), if I go UP multiple times to (5,9), I eat that apple, then I can head left towards (2,7) or (1,7).\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I grow, so my body becomes longer: head at (5,9), body at (5,8), (5,7), etc., down to (5,4) if I go straight up.\n\nBut I don't have to go straight; I can turn.\n\nBut let's compute moves.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5) now, distance to (5,9) is 4.\n\nThen from there, I can continue up to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 eat apple at (5,9) on the 5th move if I start from (5,4).\n\nThen after eating, my length increases, so I have head at (5,9), body at (5,8), tail at (5,7), etc., depending on my path.\n\nBut to reach the other apples at (1,7) or (2,7), from (5,9), it's |5-1| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves, or to (2,7) |5-2| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves.\n\nWhereas if I go towards (2,7) directly, from (5,4), min distance 6 moves as above.\n\nBut if I eat (5,9) first, I get one apple faster, but then I'm farther from the cluster.\n\nIf I go for the cluster, I might get two apples quickly.\n\nFor example, path to (2,7): from (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 that's 5 moves to reach (2,7), but I eat the apple at (2,7) on the 5th move.\n\nSimilarly, from there I can go to (1,7) easily.\n\nBut at (2,7), I eat apple, grow, then move to (1,7).\n\nNow, from (5,4), if I go LEFT to (4,4), then that's one move, and I'm closer.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5), then to reach (2,7), I need to go LEFT multiple times and UP, e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 5 moves from (5,4), but with UP first.\n\nSimilarly, with UP first to (5,5), distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5, same as from (4,4) |4-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut (5,9) is only 5 moves up, so I can get that apple in 5 moves, while to get to (2,7) it's 5 or 6 moves, but (2,7) has an apple too.\n\n(5,9) has an apple, so eating it gives me a point.\n\nIn terms of time to first apple: if I go UP now, I can get (5,9) in 4 more moves (since after this move, I need to move up 4 times to reach y=9 from y=5).\n\nFrom (5,4), after UP to (5,5), I am at (5,5), then to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 so 4 more moves to eat (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (2,7), from (5,4) after LEFT to (4,4), then to (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,7) \u2013 5 more moves to eat, or if I go directly, but it's longer.\n\nTo eat (2,7) in fewest moves: from (5,4) to (2,7) Manhattan 6, so minimum 6 moves if I don't have a direct path, but I can do it in 6 moves.\n\nFor example: LEFT to (4,4), LEFT to (3,4), UP to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 6 moves.\n\nOr shorter? |\u0394x| =3, |\u0394y|=3, min moves 6 since orthogonal.\n\n\u0394x=3, \u0394y=3, so min 6 moves, yes.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,7): need to decrease x by 3 and increase y by 3, so 6 moves.\n\nIf I go UP first to (5,5), then to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), LEFT to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 6 moves.\n\nWhereas to (5,9): from (5,4), move UP 5 times to (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(5,9) \u2013 5 moves total to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) can be eaten in 5 moves, (2,7) in 6 moves, so (5,9) is slightly faster to get the first apple.\n\nBut (2,7) is part of a cluster, so after eating one, I can eat the other nearby.\n\nAlso, the enemy is not a threat yet.\n\nAnother point: if I go for (5,9), I might be cornered at the top, but the board is open, so I can move left or right after.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), and it might grow if it eats an apple at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nFor example, if enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), then it can go to (1,0), then to (0,0) to eat apple, then it will grow and have a body.\n\nBut it's far from me.\n\nI think I should go for the closest apple or the cluster.\n\n(5,9) is vertically close; I can go straight up.\n\nMoving UP now to (5,5) is good for that.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,4), I am moving away from (5,9) but towards the cluster.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, and I can get it faster, I should do that.\n\nThen after eating, head to the cluster.\n\nBut the cluster might be eaten by no one; only enemy is at bottom, so it's safe.\n\nAlso, in the board, (1,7) and (2,7) are both there, so I can plan to get them after.\n\nBut let's see what move to make now.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nDOWN to (5,3) is bad because it moves me away from all apples, so not good.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT.\n\nUP: towards (5,9) and also generally up.\n\nLEFT: towards the left apples.\n\nSince (5,9) is directly reachable, and I can eat it in 4 moves after this, I think UP is better.\n\nIn my last move rationale, I moved LEFT to (5,4) from (6,4), so I was at (6,4) last turn, moved LEFT to (5,4).\n\nNow at (5,4), moving UP makes sense to go to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider that moving LEFT might open up more options, but UP is direct.\n\nAnother risk: if I go up, my body is at (6,4) and (7,4), so if I go up, I leave the row, and the tail will move when I move, so after moving UP to (5,5), my body will be at (5,4) and (6,4), tail at (7,4)? When I move, the head moves to new position, and the body follows, so the tail moves one step.\n\nAfter move UP to (5,5):\n- Head: (5,5)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (since the first body segment goes to where head was, and the next to where first was, so (6,4) becomes body, and (7,4) is gone? No.\n\nCurrent: head (5,4), body (6,4), tail (7,4)\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,5):\n- New head: (5,5)\n- The body segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was, (5,4)\n- The tail that was at (7,4) moves to where the first body was, (6,4)\n- So new body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (4,4):\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nNo immediate collision.\n\nBut back to decision.\n\nI think moving UP is fine.\n\nI could move LEFT to position myself to get both apples, but UP seems more direct for the vertical apple.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at the edge, so after eating, I might need to turn to avoid being trapped, but I can handle that later.\n\nFor now, UP to (5,5).\n\nThen next turn, I can continue UP to (5,6), and so on.\n\nTo reach the cluster, from (5,9), I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., but it will take more moves.\n\nBut eating (5,9) gives me a point now.\n\nWhereas if I go for the cluster, I get the first apple later but then a second quickly.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, I should eat it first.\n\nDistance to (5,9): 5 moves to eat.\n\nDistance to (2,7): 6 moves to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) is better for quick point.\n\nI am going with UP.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (2,1), it can move to (1,1) or (2,2), etc., not a threat.\n\nAlso, DOWN is bad.\n\nSo I think UP is the best move.\n on the current board state, I need to decide my next move to maximize points while avoiding collisions. Here's my analysis:\n\n- **My snake position**: Head at (5,4), body at [(6,4), (7,4)]. Valid moves from (5,4) are:\n  - UP to (5,5): empty\n  - DOWN to (5,3): empty\n  - LEFT to (4,4): empty\n  - RIGHT to (6,4): occupied by my body (invalid, collision risk).\n\n- **Apples**: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is a good target, but (5,9) is vertically closer to me (Manhattan distance 5 vs. 6 to (2,7)). Eating (5,9) first gives a quicker point, and I can then head toward the cluster.\n\n- **Enemy snake (ID 0)**: At (2,1) with no body. It's likely going for the bottom apples (e.g., (0,0) or (0,2)), so it's not an immediate threat to me.\n\n- **Move evaluation**:\n  - **DOWN (to (5,3))**: Moves me away from all apples (increases y-distance to targets), inefficient. Avoid.\n  - **LEFT (to (4,4))**: Reduces x-distance to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster but doesn't help with (5,9). It's viable but not optimal for the closest apple.\n  - **UP (to (5,5))**: Directly toward (5,9), reducing y-distance. This sets up a path to eat (5,9) in 4 more moves (e.g., UP to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)). After eating, I can turn left toward the cluster.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP to reach (5,9) efficiently. If the enemy grows or apples change, reassess path to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster.\n\nNext move: UP",

            "rationale": "<think> I can use any logic or strategy to win, including aggressive tactics against enemies.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current game state after my last move. Last turn, I moved UP to (5,5) from (5,4), as per the rationale.\n\nNow, the board has changed:\n\n- My snake (ID:1):\n  - Head: (5,5)  (since I moved UP)\n  - Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (the first body segment moved to my previous head position, and the tail moved to the previous body position)\n\n- Enemy snake (ID:0) has moved. Since I don't see an updated position, I must infer based on rules. From the last state, enemy was at (3,1) with no body. But in the last board, it was at (2,1)? Let's check the initial input.\n\nUser says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (5,5) Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\" \u2013 so yes, I am now at (5,5).\n\nEnemy: \"Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\" \u2013 oh, it's at (3,1) now? In the initial description, it was at (3,1), but in the board visualization, it was at (2,1)? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nLooking back:\n\nUser message: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\"\n\nBut in the board state visualization:\n\n\"  1 . . . 0 . . . . . . \"  \u2013 row 1, which is y=1, and at x=3, it shows '0', so head at (3,1).\n\nIn the text: \"1 . . 0 . . . . . .\" \u2013 so x=3, y=1.\n\nPreviously it was at (2,1), but now it's (3,1), meaning it moved RIGHT from (2,1) to (3,1)? But that was last turn's board? No, this is the current state.\n\nThe user provided the current state after my move.\n\nApples are the same: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9 . . . . . A . . . .\n  8 . . . . . . . . . .\n  7 . A A . . . . . . .\n  6 . . . . . . . . . .\n  5 . . . . . 1 . . . .   (my head at (5,5))\n  4 . . . . . T T . . .   (T at (5,4) and (6,4)? But body segments are T for tail? In the board, it says \"T\" for body? Let's read.\n\n\"  4 . . . . . T T . . . \" \u2013 and earlier it says Body: [(5,4), (6,4)], so (5,4) and (6,4) are body segments, labeled T? But T usually means tail. In this board, (6,4) is the tail? Since my body is [(5,4), (6,4)], and (6,4) is the last segment, so it's the tail.\n\nIn the row:\n  4: positions: x=0 to 9: . . . . . T T . . . \nSo (5,4) and (6,4) are both 'T', meaning body or tail.\n\nBut for enemy, at (3,1), it's '0'.\n\nAnd apples: (0,2) is 'A' at row 2, (5,9) at row 9, (0,0) at row 0, (2,7) and (1,7) at row 7.\n\nCurrent board state:\n 9: . . . . .

From (5,5), moving UP to (5,6) reduces the distance to (5,9) to 3 moves.\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I can head towards the cluster at (1,7) and (2,7).\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), which is closer to the bottom apples: (0,0) and (0,2). It might move towards them.\n\nFor example, enemy can move LEFT to (2,1) to get closer to (0,0) or (0,2), or DOWN to (3,0), etc.\n\nBut not a direct threat to me.\n\nOther options: I could consider going for the cluster directly.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (2,7): |\u0394x|=3, |\u0394y|=2, Manhattan distance 5.\n\nPath: e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 5 moves.\n\nTo (5,9): |\u0394x|=0, |\u0394y|=4, so 4 moves up.\n\nSo (5,9) is still closer.\n\nMoving UP now is consistent with the plan.\n\nRIGHT to (6,5) might be possible, but it doesn't help much; it moves me away from both apples.\n\nLEFT to (4,5) is towards the cluster, but not directly up.\n\nSo UP seems best.\n\nBut let's think about body positions.\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,6):\n- New head: (5,6)\n- Body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  (the tail at (6,4) moves to (5,4)? Let's see.\n\nCurrent: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (6,4)\n\nAfter move UP to (5,6):\n- Head moves to (5,6)\n- The body segment at (5,4) moves to where head was, (5,5)\n- The tail at (6,4) moves to where the first body was, (5,4)\n- So new body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  \u2013 and tail at (5,4)? No: positions: head at (5,6), first body at (5,5), second body (tail) at (5,4)\n\nSince I have two body segments, the tail is now at (5,4).\n\nPreviously, (6,4) was tail, but it moves to (5,4) after the move.\n\n(5,4) was occupied by body, but after I move, the body segments shift.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, if I move UP, I am at (5,6), closer to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider the enemy's potential move.\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), with possible moves: UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0), LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (4,1).\n\nApples at (0,0) and (0,2) are tempting.\n\nFor example, enemy might move LEFT to (2,1) to head towards (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nBut again, not affecting me.\n\nI should stick to my plan.\n\nMove: UP\n\nThen next turn, if I can, continue UP.\n\nBut after two more UP moves, I will be at (5,7), then to (5,8), then (5,9) to eat apple.\n\nAt that point, I grow, so my length increases by one; I gain a point.\n\nThen, from there, I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., towards (2,7).\n\n(2,7) is at y=7, so from (5,9) to (2,7), I need to decrease x and decrease y.\n\nBut I can do that.\n\nNo need to change strategy now.\n\nSo, I will go UP.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

The apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and (1,7). My snake (ID 1) has its head at (5,7) with body segments at (5,6) and (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 0) is head-only at (2,0). The board is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n\nFrom my head position (5,7), I can move in four directions:\n- UP to (5,8)\n- DOWN to (5,6) - but that's my body segment, so collision with myself\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n- RIGHT to (6,7)\n\nSo invalid moves: DOWN (to my own body). Valid moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nObjective is to eat apples without dying. Apples near me:\n- (5,9) is two spaces up - if I go UP twice, I can reach it\n- (2,7) and (1,7) are to the left - (2,7) is three left, (1,7) is four left\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,0), far away with no body, so it's not an immediate threat. It might be heading for apples at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nPotential strategies:\n- Move UP toward (5,9) apple: This is efficient since it's close. After eating it, I grow to length 4. Then I can head left toward the cluster of apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n- Move LEFT toward the (2,7) and (1,7) apples: This gets me into a denser apple area faster, but (5,9) is closer and easier to reach first.\n- Move RIGHT: No apples directly that way, less optimal.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- UP: (5,8) is empty, then to (5,9) apple. Safe path.\n- LEFT: (4,7) is empty, then I can go to (3,7), (2,7) apple. Also safe as no threats nearby.\n- RIGHT: (6,7) is empty, but no apples in immediate vicinity, so inefficient.\n\nWhy not RIGHT? It doesn't lead to apples quickly. The nearest apples are left or up.\n\nConsidering last move: I moved UP last time (from (5,6) to (5,7)). Continuing UP makes sense to pursue (5,9).\n\nIf I go UP now to (5,8), next turn I can go UP again to (5,9) to eat the apple. Then I'll be at (5,9) with body [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].\n\nAfter that, I can turn left toward (2,7) or (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is valuable\u2014two apples close together.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,0): It's length 1, so it might eat (0,0) or (0,2) soon, but it doesn't affect me directly at this distance.\n\nNo other snakes or obstacles in my path. Walls aren't a concern here since I'm not near edges.\n\nBest move: UP to continue toward (5,9) apple. It's the most efficient point gain.\n\nFor next turn strategy: After eating (5,9), start moving left toward (2,7). But I'll reassess then based on apple positions and enemy.\n\nSo move: UP\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

From head position (5,8), possible moves are:\n- **UP** to (5,9): There's an apple there! Eating it would grow me to length 4.\n- **DOWN** to (5,7): But that's my own body segment\u2014collision, so death. Invalid move.\n- **LEFT** to (4,8): Empty space.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,8): Also empty.\n\nSo valid moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy considerations**:\n- **UP to (5,9)**: This is highly appealing because it's an immediate apple. Eating it would give me a point and grow my snake. Since I just moved up last turn (from (5,7) to (5,8)), continuing up makes sense for efficiency. After eating, my head would be at (5,9), and my body would be [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].\n- **LEFT to (4,8)**: This moves me toward the cluster of apples at (2,7) and (1,7). From (4,8), I could go down to (4,7) next turn, then left to (3,7), and so on. However, (5,9) is closer and easier to grab first.\n- **RIGHT to (6,8)**: Less optimal. There are no apples nearby in that direction, and it would take me away from the denser apple areas. Only worth it if other moves are risky, but they're not.\n- **Enemy threat**: Snake #0 is at (1,0)\u2014far away and probably heading for (0,0) or (0,2). It has no body yet, so it's weak and slow. I don't need to worry about it for now.\n- **Risk of collision**: Only with myself, and DOWN is blocked. Other paths are clear.\n\n**Why UP is best**:\n1. **Proximity**: (5,9) is one move away. Eating it gives instant reward.\n2. **Growth**: With length 4, I'll be more resilient and can chase other apples aggressively.\n3. **Efficiency**: After eating, I can easily turn toward the left-side apples (e.g., from (5,9), go LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc.).\n4. **No downsides**: The path is safe\u2014no walls, snakes, or self-collision.\n\n**Alternative thoughts**:\n- If I go LEFT now, I might reach (2,7) faster, but it would take at least 3 moves (e.g., LEFT to (4,8), DOWN to (4,7), LEFT to (3,7), LEFT to (2,7)) versus just one move for (5,9). Prioritizing the closest apple is smarter.\n- RIGHT is wasteful\u2014no gain and delays eating.\n\n**For next turn strategy**:\n- After eating (5,9), I'll reassess apple positions. Likely head left toward (2,7) or (1,7). If the enemy snake grows, I'll need to monitor it, but it's low risk for now.\n\nFinal decision: Move UP to claim the apple at (5,9).\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

There is an enemy snake with its head at (0, 0) and a body segment at (1, 0).\n\nI should visualize the board based on the description:\n- My snake head: (5, 9)\n- My body: (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6)\n- Enemy snake head: (0, 0)\n- Enemy body: (1, 0)\n- Apples: (0,2), (2,7), (1,7), (8,0), (3,3)\n\nThe grid is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n\nNow, from my head position (5, 9), I can move in four directions:\n- UP to (5, 10): This is outside the board since y=10 doesn't exist. That would be hitting a wall and I would die.\n- DOWN to (5, 8): This is my own body segment, so collision with myself, death.\n- LEFT to (4, 9): Empty space.\n- RIGHT to (6, 9): Empty space.\n\nSo, only LEFT and RIGHT are valid moves.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) is far, at bottom-left.\n- (2,7) and (1,7) are at middle-left.\n- (8,0) is bottom-right.\n- (3,3) is middle.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (2,7) and (1,7). From my current position (5,9), moving LEFT towards (4,9) would be a step in that direction. Moving RIGHT would take me away.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0,0) with a body at (1,0). It's small and far away, so not an immediate threat.\n\nLast turn, I moved UP to (5,9). Now, from (5,9), I must avoid UP (wall) and DOWN (body). Only LEFT and RIGHT are possible.\n\nStrategy:\n- LEFT moves me closer to the apples at (2,7) and (1,7). I could plan a path: from (4,9), then down to (4,8), then left to (3,8), down to (3,7), left to (2,7) to eat the apple. That's 4 moves.\n- RIGHT takes me to (6,9), but there are no apples nearby in that direction. The closest apple would be (8,0) or (3,3), both far. Moving right might open up more options later, but it delays eating.\n\nI should prioritize eating an apple soon. My snake has length 4 (head + 3 body segments). Eating an apple would grow me to length 5 and score a point.\n\nThe apples at (2,7) and (1,7) are both at y=7. From (5,9), moving LEFT is better to get closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could go RIGHT to avoid potential conflict, but that seems suboptimal since there are no threats.\n\nAlso, I should note that the board might change as the enemy snake moves.\n\nFor next turn, I can reassess, but for now, LEFT seems like the best move to head towards the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7).\n\nTherefore, I choose LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Since I'm at (8,5), let's see what each move does:\n\n- UP: (8,5) -> (8,6)\n- DOWN: (8,5) -> (8,4)\n- LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) -> (9,5)\n\nNow, I should check for dangers and opportunities.\n\nDangers:\n- Walls: Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe since x=9 is within 0-9. Moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. UP to (8,6) and DOWN to (8,4) are also within bounds.\n- Other snakes: Enemy snake is at (2,5), which is far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- Myself: No body, so no self-collision.\n\nOpportunities: Apples. Let's see distances:\n\n- Apple at (8,2): That's directly below me at y=2 vs my y=5. So DOWN would get me closer. Specifically, moving DOWN to (8,4), then I'd need to go further down to (8,3), (8,2) \u2013 so two moves DOWN to get it.\n- Apple at (9,6): If I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 two moves: UP then RIGHT.\n- Apple at (5,9): Far away, on the top row.\n- Apple at (0,2): Even farther.\n- Apple at (0,0): Also far.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (8,2) and (9,6). (8,2) is three steps away if I go DOWN (since moving DOWN once to (8,4) doesn't get it, I need to go to (8,3) then (8,2)). Actually, from (8,5) to (8,2) is a straight line down, distance |5-2| = 3 in y-direction.\n\nSimilarly, (9,6) is at x=9,y=6. From (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) then UP to (9,6) would take two moves, or UP to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6) \u2013 same thing.\n\nBut I can only make one move now, so I need to choose which direction helps me get to an apple safely.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake. It's at (2,5), which is not a threat now, but I should be aware that it might be moving towards apples too.\n\nSince I have no body, I can turn around freely, no risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, potential dangers next turn: If I move to a spot, what could happen?\n\nBut since I'm only deciding this move, I'll think one step at a time.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- UP to (8,6): This is safe. Then next turn, I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to get the apple there, or LEFT, etc.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Safe. Then I can go further DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2) for the apple. But moving down might not be ideal if there are obstacles, but none apparent.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Safe, but no apple directly near there. The closest apple is at (8,2) or (0,2), both down and left, but moving left doesn't get me much closer directly.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Safe. Then I can go UP to (9,6) for the apple.\n\n(9,6) is an apple, so if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) would eat it. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) also eats it.\n\nBut going RIGHT directly to (9,5) might be better because from (9,5), I can go UP to (9,6) to eat the apple. If I go UP first to (8,6), I can still go RIGHT to (9,6), but it's the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT now to (9,5), I'm on the edge, which might be riskier in future if the snake grows, but right now it's fine.\n\nMoving towards (8,2): If I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn I go DOWN to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat it. That's three moves, whereas (9,6) can be reached in two moves: for example, RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nFrom current position (8,5):\n\n- To (9,6): Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (8,2): |8-8| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo (9,6) is closer in Manhattan distance.\n\nAlso, (9,6) is an apple, and I can get it in two moves.\n\nBut I need to make the first move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then (9,5) might be a safe position? Let me see the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nAt y=6, x=9: there's an apple at (9,6), and at (9,5) I would be moving, but currently it's empty as per the grid.\n\nThe grid shows at row 6: . . . . . . . . . A  so (9,6) has apple.\n\nAt row 5: . . 0 . . . . . 1 .  wait, no: row 5 is index 5, columns 0 to 9.\n\nLet's read the grid properly.\n\nThe board is printed with y from 9 top to 0 bottom.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . A . . . .  so (5,9) has apple? No: coordinates are (x,y), and it says \"Apples at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,6)\"\n\nIn the grid:\n\nFor y=9: \"9 . . . . . A . . . .\" which is x from 0 to 9: so position (5,9) has A, which matches the apple at (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, y=6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (9,6) has A.\n\ny=2: \"2 A . . . . . . . A .\" so (0,2) and (8,2) have apples? (0,2) and (8,2) are both at y=2.\n\ny=0: \"0 A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,0) has apple.\n\nNow, my position: snake 1 head at (8,5), and in row 5: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so at x=2, y=5: 0 (enemy head), at x=8, y=5: 1 (my head).\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, row 5: it ends with \" . 1 . \" but x=8 is 1, x=9 should be the next. Row 5 says: \"5 . . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" \u2013 positions: x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot? The string is \". . 0 . . . . . 1 .\" so for x=0: dot, x=1: dot, x=2: 0, x=3: dot, x=4: dot, x=5: dot, x=6: dot, x=7: dot, x=8: 1, x=9: dot. So (9,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (8,6): row 6 is \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (8,6) should be a dot? Row 6: y=6, \" . . . . . . . . . A \" so x=0 to x=8 are dots, x=9 is A. So (8,6) is empty dot.\n\n(8,4): row 4 is not shown, but since it's not mentioned, it should be empty.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nNow, to get the apple at (9,6): I can move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nI could move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) to eat it.\n\nBoth sequences get me the apple in two moves.\n\nWhich is better? Moving RIGHT first might be slightly better because (9,5) is closer to the apple, and after eating, I might have more options, but I'm not sure.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2), which is below.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3), then to (8,2) to eat, but that takes three moves.\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, and after that, I might go elsewhere.\n\nHowever, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy snake at (2,5). It might be heading towards apples too. For example, (5,9) is up, or (0,2) down left.\n\nBut (9,6) is on the opposite side, so less likely for enemy to go there immediately.\n\nMoreover, since I'm closer to (9,6) than enemy: enemy at (2,5), distance to (9,6) is |2-9| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8, while I'm at (8,5), distance 2.\n\nSo I can easily get it.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,2), enemy distance |2-8| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9, my distance 3, so I'm closer.\n\nBut (9,6) is closer to me.\n\nIn terms of points, getting any apple gives one point, so I should go for the nearest.\n\nBut I need to choose a direction for this move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm at x=9, which is the right edge. Then after eating at (9,6), I might be cornered, but since I'll grow, I have a body, but I can move down or left from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), I'm at (8,6), then to (9,6) to eat, then I can go left or down.\n\nBut going RIGHT first places me on the edge.\n\nPerhaps going UP first is better because (8,6) is not on the edge.\n\nBut (9,5) is on the edge, which might be riskier if there are other snakes, but only one enemy, far away.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,9), which is top center, but far from me.\n\nI think (9,6) is the best target.\n\nNow, between moving RIGHT or UP to start towards it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), then next turn RIGHT to (9,6) eats apple.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the apple on the second move.\n\nBut after moving to (9,5), I have only one choice: UP to get the apple. But I could choose not to, but that would be silly since I want the apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (8,6), I should go RIGHT to eat.\n\nNow, is there a risk in moving to (9,5)? It's on the edge, but no immediate danger.\n\n(8,6) is more central.\n\nBut I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy at (2,5). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFor example, if it moves RIGHT to (3,5), or towards the apple at (5,9) by going UP, etc.\n\nBut it's far, so probably not affecting me this turn or next.\n\nSo I think I should head towards (9,6).\n\nNow, which direction: UP or RIGHT?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), then next turn I must go UP to (9,6) to get the apple. If I go LEFT or DOWN from (9,5), I might miss the apple or take longer.\n\nFrom (9,5), going UP is the best.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (8,6), then going RIGHT to (9,6) is best.\n\nBut from (8,6), I could also go DOWN to (8,5), but that's back to start, not good.\n\nOr LEFT to (7,6), but that moves away from the apple.\n\nSo essentially, once I commit to a first move, the second move should be towards the apple.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT first might be better because (9,5) is adjacent to the apple, so I can eat it next turn directly.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (8,6), I'm not adjacent to the apple; I need to move to (9,6) to eat, which is adjacent.\n\n(8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent, so from (8,6) I can move RIGHT to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,5) I move UP to (9,6) to eat.\n\nSo both are one step away from eating after the first move.\n\nNo difference in that regard.\n\nPerhaps moving RIGHT to (9,5) is fine.\n\nBut let's see the board: at (9,6) there is an apple, and no snakes near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, I will grow, so my body will be at (9,5) or something.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. Then I am at (9,5). Next turn, if I move UP to (9,6), I eat the apple, and my head moves to (9,6), and my body is at (9,5), since I had no body before, now I have one body segment at (9,5).\n\nThen from there, I can consider other apples.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP first to (8,6), then to (9,6), body at (8,6).\n\nI think both are equally good.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first might be more efficient if I want to go to other places later.\n\nFor example, after eating at (9,6), if I am at (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5), but (9,5) would be my body if I came that way.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT then UP: after eating, head at (9,6), body at (9,5). Then I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I moved UP then RIGHT: head at (9,6), body at (8,6). Then I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6), but (8,6) is body, so I have to go DOWN or something.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, if I go RIGHT to (9,5), then to (9,6), the body is at (9,5), so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6) safely.\n\nSimilarly in the other case.\n\nNow, there's also the apple at (8,2) below.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I start moving towards (8,2), but it's farther.\n\nMoreover, after getting (9,6), I can go down towards (8,2) or other apples.\n\n(8,2) is at the same x, so from (9,6) I can go LEFT to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5), but (8,5) was my start, but it might be empty now.\n\nAfter I move, the previous positions are empty unless occupied.\n\nSince I have no body, when I move from (8,5), it becomes empty.\n\nSo after moving, (8,5) is free.\n\nSo from (9,6), I can go to (8,6), then to (8,5), etc., down to (8,2).\n\nBut (8,2) is an apple, so I might go for it later.\n\nBut for now, (9,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at (5,9), which is far, or (0,2) etc.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, I should prioritize not letting the enemy get them, but since enemy is far, I can get (9,6) safely.\n\nNow, I think the best move is either UP or RIGHT towards (9,6).\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps RIGHT is better because it gets me to the x-boundary, which might reduce options, but in this case, since I'm going to eat the apple next turn, it's fine.\n\nOr UP to (8,6) keeps me more central.\n\nBut I think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nThere's also the apple at (8,2) which is directly below, but it's three moves away.\n\nIf I go DOWN, to (8,4), then I need to go down two more times to get to (8,2).\n\nBut in that time, I could have gotten (9,6) by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nFor example, in two moves, I can have eaten an apple by going to (9,6), whereas going down, after two moves I am at (8,3) or something, not having eaten yet.\n\nAfter move 1: if DOWN to (8,4), no apple eaten.\n\nMove 2: DOWN to (8,3), still no apple.\n\nMove 3: DOWN to (8,2), eat apple.\n\nWhereas for (9,6): move 1: RIGHT to (9,5), no apple.\n\nMove 2: UP to (9,6), eat apple.\n\nSo I eat on the second move for (9,6), but on the third move for (8,2).\n\nTherefore, (9,6) is better to target first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,9) is |8-5| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves away at least.\n\nSo I should go for (9,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move in a direction that starts towards it.\n\nEither RIGHT or UP.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am on the edge, but it's fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am not on edge.\n\nBut since the enemy is far, edge should be safe.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT might allow me to claim that area.\n\nI could also consider that from (9,5), I am closer to (9,6), which is good.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (8,5)\n\nRIGHT: (9,5)\n\nThen next turn, UP to (9,6) to eat apple.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go UP first to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6).\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAnother point: there is an apple at (8,2), which is directly south. If I go DOWN, I might be able to get it later, but it's not as efficient now.\n\nI think RIGHT is fine.\n\nBut what about the enemy? It might go for other apples.\n\nFor example, enemy at (2,5) might go towards (0,2) or (5,9) or (0,0).\n\n(5,9) is at (5,9), enemy can go UP to (2,6), etc., but it's away from me.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nBut the move is just the direction: RIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the apple at (8,2), if I go DOWN now, I start towards it, but it takes longer, and I might miss the opportunity for (9,6), which is closer.\n\nAlso, (9,6) might be taken by no one else, but since enemy is far, it's safe.\n\nThe apples don't get taken until someone moves onto them, I assume.\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (8,6) to have more options.\n\nFor example, from (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat, or if I change my mind, go LEFT, but that would be away.\n\nBut I think I should commit to the apple.\n\nMoreover, moving UP to (8,6) might not be worse.\n\nBut let's see: after moving to (9,5) or (8,6), both are one step from the apple.\n\nBut (9,5) has the advantage that from there, if for some reason I can't go UP, but I can, so it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT.\n\nSo direction: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check the board for any dangers.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From the grid, it's empty, as per row 5: x=9 is dot.\n\nSimilarly, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (2,5), far.\n\nSo safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4): also safe, but not towards closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,5): safe, but away from apples.\n\nUP to (8,6): safe, towards apple but not direct.\n\nBut UP is also good.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice to start the path to (9,6).\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI have decided to move RIGHT to position (9,5). This move positions me to collect the apple at (9,6) on the next turn, which is the most efficient path to gain a point quickly. The enemy snake is far away at (2,5) and poses no immediate threat. Moving towards the nearest apple maximizes my point accumulation potential",

My head moves to (9,6), and a body segment is added at (9,5). This is safe and efficient.\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT delays eating an apple and wastes a turn. DOWN to (9,4) moves away from apples; LEFT to (8,5) is neutral but not directly towards any apple.\n- RIGHT is impossible, so not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations: Enemy at (2,4) might move towards apples like (0,2) or (8,2), but it's slow (Manhattan distance to (8,2) is |2-8| + |4-2| = 6+2=8 moves away). I should capitalize on immediate gains.\n\nAfter this move, if I eat (9,6), I can plan next turn to head towards (8,2) by going DOWN from (9,6) to (9,5) (but that would be my body, so not allowed) or LEFT to (8,6), then down.

The board visualization shows:\n- Row 9: . . . . . A . . . .  (A at (5,9))\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: . . A . . . . . . .  (A at (2,7)? But apples are listed as (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0) - no (2,7) mentioned. Inconsistency here. According to apple list, (2,7) shouldn't be an apple. Probably visualization error? I'll trust the text list: apples at (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0))\n\nBoard state:\n9: . . . . . A . . . .  -> A at (5,9)\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . . . . . .  -> no apple at (2,7) per apple list\n6: . . . . . . . . . 1  -> my head at (9,6)\n5: . . . . . . . . . T  -> T should be my tail? Body at (9,5)\n4: . . . . . . . . . .\n3: . . 0 . . . . . . .  -> enemy head at (2,3)\n2: A . . . . . . . A .  -> apples at (0,2) and (8,2)\n1: . . . . . . . . . .\n0: A . . . . . . . . .  -> apple at (0,0)\n\nSo apples are at: (0,0), (0,2), (5,9), (8,2)\n\nMy current position: head at (9,6), body at (9,5). My possible moves:\n- UP: to (9,7) - empty\n- DOWN: to (9,5) - that's my body! Would cause collision and death\n- LEFT: to (8,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: to (10,6) - invalid, wall collision (x=10 not on board)\n\nSo DOWN is suicide, RIGHT is wall collision - both fatal. Only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, where are apples? (5,9) is far northwest, (0,0) and (0,2) are southwest, (8,2) is southeast.\n\nI should consider:\n- UP to (9,7): gets me closer to (5,9) but not directly\n- LEFT to (8,6): gets me closer to (8,2) which is at (8,2)\n\nDistance to apples:\n- To (5,9): Manhattan = |9-5| + |6-9| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (8,2): |9-8| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (0,2): |9-0| + |6-2| = 9 + 4 = 13\n- To (0,0): |9-0| + |6-0| = 9 + 6 = 15\n\n(8,2) is closest at distance 5. (5,9) is 7, others farther.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I reduce x-distance to (8,2) to 0, but y-distance is |6-2|=4, so still 4 moves away. Then I can go DOWN multiple times.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), I'm at (9,7), then to (5,9) I need to go LEFT and UP, but it's inefficient since (5,9) is at y=9 and I'm at x=9.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,3) might go for (0,2) or (8,2). Distance to (8,2): |2-8| + |3-2| = 6+1=7, so it would take at least 7 moves to get there. I can reach (8,2) in 5 moves if I go optimally.\n\nBut I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I only have one body segment, I can still maneuver.\n\nBest immediate move: LEFT to (8,6) to start heading toward (8,2). UP to (9,7) doesn't help much and might lead me away from targets.\n\nStrategy: After LEFT to (8,6), next move could be DOWN to (8,5), then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) to eat that apple. That's 4 moves away.\n\nWhereas if I go UP first, I'd have to go LEFT later anyway to get to the western apples, wasting a move.\n\nAlso, consider that enemy might be heading toward (8,2) too, but it's farther away.\n\nSo LEFT is better to start closing in on the nearest apple at (8,2).\n\nMove: LEFT\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Only UP, DOWN, or LEFT are viable.\n\n**Apple priority analysis**:\n- Closest apple: (8,2) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-8| + |6-2| = 4).\n- (2,7) is |8-2| + |6-7| = 6+1 = 7 units away.\n- (0,2) is |8-0| + |6-2| = 8+4 = 12 units away.\n- (0,0) and (5,9) are farther away (>12 units).\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #0 at (2,2) could compete for (0,2) or (2,7), but it's far from (8,2). Distance to (8,2) for enemy: |2-8| + |2-2| = 6 units. I can reach (8,2) in 4 moves if I go DOWN repeatedly, beating the enemy there.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n- Short-term: Target (8,2) for quick growth. Requires moving DOWN.\n- Medium-term: After eating (8,2), I could loop toward (2,7) or (5,9).\n- Risk assessment: Moving LEFT or UP now would delay reaching (8,2), giving the enemy time to approach it.\n\n**Move evaluation**:\n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Directly reduces distance to (8,2). Safe path (no obstacles). Aligns with shortest apple route.\n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Moves away from (8,2) but toward center. Less optimal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It efficiently targets the nearest apple (8,2), minimizes collision risk, and leverages my positional advantage over the enemy. I'll commit to this path and reassess after eating the apple.\n\n**Note for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), continue downward toward (8,2).

This means I just moved down to (8,4) from (8,5) in the last move.\n- Apples are located at: (0,2), (5,9), (8,2), (0,0), (2,7)\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at head (4,2) with no body. So it's just a single segment snake.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- (8,4) is my head, (8,5) is my body\n- Apples: (0,2) bottom left, (5,9) top center, (8,2) bottom near me, (0,0) bottom left corner, (2,7) top left\n- Enemy snake at (4,2) - this is at the bottom row, x=4 y=2\n\nPossible moves from my current position (8,4):\n\n1.

LEFT to (7,4): Moves me horizontally left.\n4. RIGHT to (9,4): This is within the board since x=9 is valid (0-9).\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy snake at (4,2): It might be heading toward (0,2) or (0,0) since those are closest to it. Distance to (8,2) is |4-8| + |2-2| = 4, so I'm closer to (8,2). It's unlikely to threaten me directly right now.\n- Board boundaries: All moves are safe regarding walls since (8,3), (7,4), and (9,4) are all within 0-9.\n- No other snakes or immediate dangers near my position.\n\nApple targeting strategy:\n- Closest apple is (8,2) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. That's just two moves away (DOWN twice).\n- Next closest is (2,7) at |8-2| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9, then (5,9) at 5+5=10, and others farther.\n- Getting (8,2) quickly gives me a point and grows my snake. Efficient.\n\nConsidering moves:\n- DOWN to (8,3): Puts me one step closer to (8,2). Next turn I could go DOWN again to eat it.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Moves me away from the apple. Why do this? Only if I suspect the enemy might come near, but currently no threat.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Also moves away from apples. The right side of the board has no apples currently.\n\nStrategic planning:\n- Short-term: Secure the easy apple at (8,2). After eating it, my snake will have head at (8,2) and body at (8,3), with the tail still at (8,5) initially but then following as I move.\n- Medium-term: After (8,2), I could aim for (2,7) or (5,9). (2,7) might be better as it's closer than (5,9) and the enemy is at (4,2) which is far from there.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT? They don't progress toward any apple and only delay my growth. DOWN is direct progress.\n\nDanger evaluation:\n- If I go DOWN to (8,3), the enemy at (4,2) is 4 units away horizontally and same y. It would take it at least 4 moves to reach me, and I'll have eaten (8,2) by then.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't provide any safety advantage.\n\nConclusion:\n- DOWN is clearly the best move to capture (8,2) apple efficiently.\n- I should go DOWN now to (8,3), then next turn go DOWN again to (8,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember this plan: After eating (8,2), consider moving toward (2,7) or (5,9) based on enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my move is DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nDOWN",

The closest ones are:\n- (0,2) is to the left, same y=2, distance 8 units in x-direction.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are at y=7, which is 5 units up and 6-7 units left.\n- (5,9) is at x=5,y=9, which is 3 units right and 7 units up from me? From (8,2) to (5,9): delta x= -3, delta y=7, total distance 10.\n- (0,0) is far.\n\nSince UP (to (8,3)) is blocked by my own body, I can't go up. So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT are options.\n\nBut DOWN to (8,1) is empty, and moving away from most apples. LEFT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) and (0,2). RIGHT to (9,2) is moving right, and the next apple in that direction is (5,9), but that's up-right.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is left and down from me. If I go LEFT, I might get closer to it, but it has no body, so it's short and probably not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: I should start moving toward the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7). To get there, I need to go left and up. But I can't go up directly because (8,3) is blocked. So I must go left or down first.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), I'm going away from those apples. If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I'm moving right, which might box me in since the board edge is there. But (9,2) is valid, then I could go up to (9,3), etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,2) is better because it gets me closer to the apples on the left. From there, I can then go UP to (7,3), and so on, toward y=7.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,2) which is on the same row. If I go all the way left, I could get it, but that might take many moves, and the enemy might get it first. But it's an option.\n\nPrioritizing the closer apples: (1,7) and (2,7) are at distance: from (8,2) to (2,7) is delta x=6 left, delta y=5 up, total Manhattan distance 11. To (0,2) is delta x=8 left, same y, distance 8. But (0,2) is easier because it's horizontal, no vertical movement needed.\n\nBut (0,2) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together. If I go for them, I could potentially eat both.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,1): It might go for (0,2) or (0,0) since it's near the bottom. Or it could move up toward (1,7)/(2,7). I need to be cautious.\n\nFor this turn, since I can't go UP, the best moves are LEFT or RIGHT. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT to (9,2) is an edge, which limits future moves. LEFT to (7,2) is more central and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\nAlso, from (7,2), I can then go UP to (7,3) next turn if possible, as my body will have moved. After I move to (7,2), my new head is (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. Then (8,3) and (8,4) are behind, so (7,3) should be free unless something changes.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best choice to start heading toward the apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nAs a note for next turn: Continue moving left or up toward the apples. Watch out for enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Possible enemy moves would be toward apples or away, but I need to focus on my own safety and scoring.\n\nApples are:\n- (0,2) - close to enemy\n- (0,0) - very close to enemy (adjacent left)\n- (5,9) - far top-right\n- (1,7) and (2,7) - top-left cluster\n\nMy strategy:\n- I have 3 segments (head + 2 body parts). Enemy has only 1 segment.\n- Best apple targets: The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is ideal for efficient growth. They are 3 steps away horizontally and 3 vertically from my head (7,4).\n- Immediate danger: Moving DOWN would kill me, so it's not an option. Right now, no direct threat from enemy since it's far away at (1,0).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- UP (to (7,5)): Moves me toward row 7 apples, but vertically. From (7,5), I'd still need to go left to reach apples. Safe.\n- LEFT (to (6,4)): Directly reduces distance to (1,7)/(2,7). From (6,4), I can go UP then LEFT. Also safe.\n- RIGHT (to (8,4)): Moves away from all apples except (5,9), which is inefficient. Avoid.\n- DOWN: Suicide, discarded.\n\nComparing UP vs LEFT:\n- Distance to closest apple (1,7): \n  - From (7,4): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=3\n  - UP to (7,5): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=2\n  - LEFT to (6,4): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- LEFT reduces the x-distance more significantly (1 unit vs UP reducing y by 1). Since apples are at x=1-2, moving left is more direct.\n- After LEFT, I can go UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5), etc., toward the cluster.\n- UP first would require more left movements later.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,0) will likely eat the apple at (0,0) or (0,2) next turn, growing to 2 segments. But it won't threaten me immediately as it's far.\n\nLong-term:\n- I should head toward the apple cluster. Eating one apple there gives me growth and another apple adjacent for potential double-score.\n- Avoid the bottom where enemy is.\n\nDecision: LEFT is better than UP for reducing distance to the target apples more efficiently. RIGHT is wasteful.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue toward (1,7)/(2,7) via UP or further LEFT after moving to (6,4).\n\nFinal move: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Enemy will likely go for these.\n- (5,9) is far away and inefficient to reach.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are the best targets - close and clustered for potential multi-apple gains.\n\nEnemy behavior:\n- Enemy at (1,1) can move UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0) (apple there), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1). Since (1,0) has an apple, it might go DOWN to eat it and grow. If it does, it will have a body segment next turn, becoming more dangerous.\n\nMy strategy:\n- Head toward the apple cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) efficiently.\n- Minimize risk from the enemy, which is still distant.\n- Avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nDistance to apple cluster:\n- From (6,4) to (1,7): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3\n- I need to reduce both x and y differences.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (to (6,5)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=2 - improves y-distance\n- DOWN (to (6,3)): \u0394x=5, \u0394y=4 - worse, moving away\n- LEFT (to (5,4)): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3 - improves x-distance\n\nComparing:\n- UP: Gets me closer vertically to the apples, but horizontally same.\n- LEFT: Gets me closer horizontally, vertically same.\n- The apples are at y=7, so I need to go UP eventually.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right.\n\nApples are at: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nMy snake (ID:1) is:\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(6,4), (7,4)]\n\nEnemy snake (ID:0) is:\n- Head: (2,1)\n- Body: none (so it's just a single segment)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9: . . . . . A . . . .   (A at (5,9))\n  8: . . . . . . . . . .\n  7: . A A . . . . . . .   (A at (1,7) and (2,7))\n  6: . . . . . . . . . .\n  5: . . . . . . . . . .\n  4: . . . . . 1 H T . .   (My head at (5,4), body at (6,4) and (7,4) - so (6,4) is body, (7,4) is tail)\n  3: . . . . . . . . . .\n  2: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,2))\n  1: . . 0 . . . . . . .   (Enemy head at (2,1))\n  0: A . . . . . . . . .   (A at (0,0))\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nIn the board, (5,4) is my head, (6,4) is the first body segment (H for body?), and (7,4) is the tail (T). The enemy is at (2,1).\n\nPossible moves from my head at (5,4):\n- UP: to (5,5)\n- DOWN: to (5,3)\n- LEFT: to (4,4)\n- RIGHT: to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is occupied by my body, so RIGHT is not safe - I would collide with myself. Similarly, moving into walls or the enemy would be bad, but here positions seem ok.\n\nSo valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, apples:\n- (0,0) and (0,2) are near the enemy at (2,1). Enemy can move to them easily.\n- (5,9) is at the top, far from me and the enemy.\n- (1,7) and (2,7) are clustered at the top-left, which might be a good target for me.\n\nI should aim to get apples efficiently while avoiding risks.\n\nDistance from my head (5,4) to key points:\n- To apple (1,7): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (2,7): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=3\n- To apple (5,9): \u0394x=0, \u0394y=5 - very close vertically but y=9 is far.\n\n(5,9) is directly above me, but at y=9, while I'm at y=4. So it would take 5 moves up to reach it, but since I need to grow, it might be an option. However, (1,7) and (2,7) are closer if I move diagonally.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is 2 units right and 3 units down from (0,0) and (0,2). It can move towards them.\n\nEnemy possible moves:\n- From (2,1):\n  - UP: to (2,2) - empty\n  - DOWN: to (2,0) - empty? (0,0) is apple, but (2,0) is empty, (1,0) is empty? Board shows row 0: A at (0,0), so (2,0) is empty.\n  - LEFT: to (1,1) - empty\n  - RIGHT: to (3,1) - empty\n\nEnemy might go for (0,0) or (0,2), so it might move LEFT to (1,1), then to (0,1), etc., or DOWN to (2,0) to get closer to (0,0).\n\nBut since (0,0) and (0,2) are apples, it will likely head that way.\n\nFor me, the top apples (1,7) and (2,7) are safer and closer in terms of steps.\n\nMy best move to head towards (1,7) or (2,7):\n- From (5,4), I need to reduce x and increase y.\n- UP: to (5,5) - increases y, same x, so closer in y but not x\n- LEFT: to (4,4) - decreases x, same y, so closer in x but not y\n- DOWN: to (5,3) - decreases y, worse\n\nSo UP or LEFT are both reasonable.\n\nSince the apples are at x=1 or 2 and y=7, I need to decrease x more than increase y currently (\u0394x=4 or 3 vs \u0394y=3). So moving LEFT to reduce x might be better.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,4), I can then go UP to (4,5), and so on.\n\nMoving UP to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5), etc.\n\nBoth paths have similar number of steps.\n\nBut there might be a risk if the enemy comes up, but it's far away.\n\nAnother idea: the apple at (5,9) is directly above. If I go UP multiple times, I can get it. From (5,4) to (5,9) is 5 moves up. After eating, I grow, so I become longer.\n\nBut (1,7) is only 4 moves if I go left and up efficiently (e.g., LEFT, UP, LEFT, UP to reach (3,6), etc., but to (1,7) from (5,4): min steps 4? \u0394x=4, \u0394y=3, so min 4 moves if diagonal, but since moves are orthogonal, Manhattan distance is 7, so it takes 7 moves to reach exactly, but I can eat on the way or something.\n\nManhattan distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |4-7| = 3 + 3 = 6 moves.\n\nTo (5,9) is |5-5| + |4-9| = 0 + 5 = 5 moves.\n\nSo (5,9) is closer in terms of moves: 5 vs 6 to (2,7).\n\nBut (5,9) is only one apple, while (1,7) and (2,7) are two apples close together, so if I can get both, it's better.\n\nHowever, I need to get there without dying.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,9), I might be stuck at the top, but I can move down.\n\nBut let's see the board: from (5,9), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut for now, (5,9) is reachable in 5 moves, and since I'm at (5,4), moving UP gets me closer.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP now to (5,5) reduces distance to (5,9) to 4.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,4) reduces distance to (2,7) but increases to (5,9) slightly.\n\nBut I should decide on a target.\n\nLong-term strategy: collect multiple apples quickly to grow and have advantage.\n\nThe cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is attractive because I can potentially eat both in sequence.\n\n(5,9) is isolated.\n\nAlso, there might be new apples spawning, but I don't know the rules; I think apples stay until eaten, and new ones might spawn, but not specified.\n\nThe user didn't say anything about apple spawning, so probably fixed set until eaten.\n\nApples: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7) \u2013 five apples.\n\nEnemy might eat the ones at bottom.\n\nSo, I should go for the top ones.\n\nBut (5,9) is on the way to the top, but not directly.\n\nFrom (5,4), if I go UP multiple times to (5,9), I eat that apple, then I can head left towards (2,7) or (1,7).\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I grow, so my body becomes longer: head at (5,9), body at (5,8), (5,7), etc., down to (5,4) if I go straight up.\n\nBut I don't have to go straight; I can turn.\n\nBut let's compute moves.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5) now, distance to (5,9) is 4.\n\nThen from there, I can continue up to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 eat apple at (5,9) on the 5th move if I start from (5,4).\n\nThen after eating, my length increases, so I have head at (5,9), body at (5,8), tail at (5,7), etc., depending on my path.\n\nBut to reach the other apples at (1,7) or (2,7), from (5,9), it's |5-1| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves, or to (2,7) |5-2| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves.\n\nWhereas if I go towards (2,7) directly, from (5,4), min distance 6 moves as above.\n\nBut if I eat (5,9) first, I get one apple faster, but then I'm farther from the cluster.\n\nIf I go for the cluster, I might get two apples quickly.\n\nFor example, path to (2,7): from (5,4), I can go LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 that's 5 moves to reach (2,7), but I eat the apple at (2,7) on the 5th move.\n\nSimilarly, from there I can go to (1,7) easily.\n\nBut at (2,7), I eat apple, grow, then move to (1,7).\n\nNow, from (5,4), if I go LEFT to (4,4), then that's one move, and I'm closer.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,5), then to reach (2,7), I need to go LEFT multiple times and UP, e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 5 moves from (5,4), but with UP first.\n\nSimilarly, with UP first to (5,5), distance to (2,7) is |5-2| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5, same as from (4,4) |4-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut (5,9) is only 5 moves up, so I can get that apple in 5 moves, while to get to (2,7) it's 5 or 6 moves, but (2,7) has an apple too.\n\n(5,9) has an apple, so eating it gives me a point.\n\nIn terms of time to first apple: if I go UP now, I can get (5,9) in 4 more moves (since after this move, I need to move up 4 times to reach y=9 from y=5).\n\nFrom (5,4), after UP to (5,5), I am at (5,5), then to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) \u2013 so 4 more moves to eat (5,9).\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (2,7), from (5,4) after LEFT to (4,4), then to (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,7) \u2013 5 more moves to eat, or if I go directly, but it's longer.\n\nTo eat (2,7) in fewest moves: from (5,4) to (2,7) Manhattan 6, so minimum 6 moves if I don't have a direct path, but I can do it in 6 moves.\n\nFor example: LEFT to (4,4), LEFT to (3,4), UP to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 6 moves.\n\nOr shorter? |\u0394x| =3, |\u0394y|=3, min moves 6 since orthogonal.\n\n\u0394x=3, \u0394y=3, so min 6 moves, yes.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,7): need to decrease x by 3 and increase y by 3, so 6 moves.\n\nIf I go UP first to (5,5), then to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), LEFT to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 still 6 moves.\n\nWhereas to (5,9): from (5,4), move UP 5 times to (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(5,9) \u2013 5 moves total to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) can be eaten in 5 moves, (2,7) in 6 moves, so (5,9) is slightly faster to get the first apple.\n\nBut (2,7) is part of a cluster, so after eating one, I can eat the other nearby.\n\nAlso, the enemy is not a threat yet.\n\nAnother point: if I go for (5,9), I might be cornered at the top, but the board is open, so I can move left or right after.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), and it might grow if it eats an apple at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nFor example, if enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), then it can go to (1,0), then to (0,0) to eat apple, then it will grow and have a body.\n\nBut it's far from me.\n\nI think I should go for the closest apple or the cluster.\n\n(5,9) is vertically close; I can go straight up.\n\nMoving UP now to (5,5) is good for that.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,4), I am moving away from (5,9) but towards the cluster.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, and I can get it faster, I should do that.\n\nThen after eating, head to the cluster.\n\nBut the cluster might be eaten by no one; only enemy is at bottom, so it's safe.\n\nAlso, in the board, (1,7) and (2,7) are both there, so I can plan to get them after.\n\nBut let's see what move to make now.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nDOWN to (5,3) is bad because it moves me away from all apples, so not good.\n\nSo between UP and LEFT.\n\nUP: towards (5,9) and also generally up.\n\nLEFT: towards the left apples.\n\nSince (5,9) is directly reachable, and I can eat it in 4 moves after this, I think UP is better.\n\nIn my last move rationale, I moved LEFT to (5,4) from (6,4), so I was at (6,4) last turn, moved LEFT to (5,4).\n\nNow at (5,4), moving UP makes sense to go to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider that moving LEFT might open up more options, but UP is direct.\n\nAnother risk: if I go up, my body is at (6,4) and (7,4), so if I go up, I leave the row, and the tail will move when I move, so after moving UP to (5,5), my body will be at (5,4) and (6,4), tail at (7,4)? When I move, the head moves to new position, and the body follows, so the tail moves one step.\n\nAfter move UP to (5,5):\n- Head: (5,5)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (since the first body segment goes to where head was, and the next to where first was, so (6,4) becomes body, and (7,4) is gone? No.\n\nCurrent: head (5,4), body (6,4), tail (7,4)\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,5):\n- New head: (5,5)\n- The body segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was, (5,4)\n- The tail that was at (7,4) moves to where the first body was, (6,4)\n- So new body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (4,4):\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\n\nNo immediate collision.\n\nBut back to decision.\n\nI think moving UP is fine.\n\nI could move LEFT to position myself to get both apples, but UP seems more direct for the vertical apple.\n\nAlso, the apple at (5,9) is at the edge, so after eating, I might need to turn to avoid being trapped, but I can handle that later.\n\nFor now, UP to (5,5).\n\nThen next turn, I can continue UP to (5,6), and so on.\n\nTo reach the cluster, from (5,9), I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., but it will take more moves.\n\nBut eating (5,9) gives me a point now.\n\nWhereas if I go for the cluster, I get the first apple later but then a second quickly.\n\nBut since (5,9) is closer, I should eat it first.\n\nDistance to (5,9): 5 moves to eat.\n\nDistance to (2,7): 6 moves to eat.\n\nSo (5,9) is better for quick point.\n\nI am going with UP.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (2,1), it can move to (1,1) or (2,2), etc., not a threat.\n\nAlso, DOWN is bad.\n\nSo I think UP is the best move.\n on the current board state, I need to decide my next move to maximize points while avoiding collisions. Here's my analysis:\n\n- **My snake position**: Head at (5,4), body at [(6,4), (7,4)]. Valid moves from (5,4) are:\n  - UP to (5,5): empty\n  - DOWN to (5,3): empty\n  - LEFT to (4,4): empty\n  - RIGHT to (6,4): occupied by my body (invalid, collision risk).\n\n- **Apples**: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is a good target, but (5,9) is vertically closer to me (Manhattan distance 5 vs. 6 to (2,7)). Eating (5,9) first gives a quicker point, and I can then head toward the cluster.\n\n- **Enemy snake (ID 0)**: At (2,1) with no body. It's likely going for the bottom apples (e.g., (0,0) or (0,2)), so it's not an immediate threat to me.\n\n- **Move evaluation**:\n  - **DOWN (to (5,3))**: Moves me away from all apples (increases y-distance to targets), inefficient. Avoid.\n  - **LEFT (to (4,4))**: Reduces x-distance to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster but doesn't help with (5,9). It's viable but not optimal for the closest apple.\n  - **UP (to (5,5))**: Directly toward (5,9), reducing y-distance. This sets up a path to eat (5,9) in 4 more moves (e.g., UP to (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9)). After eating, I can turn left toward the cluster.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP to reach (5,9) efficiently. If the enemy grows or apples change, reassess path to the (1,7)/(2,7) cluster.\n\nNext move: UP",

            "rationale": "<think> I can use any logic or strategy to win, including aggressive tactics against enemies.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current game state after my last move. Last turn, I moved UP to (5,5) from (5,4), as per the rationale.\n\nNow, the board has changed:\n\n- My snake (ID:1):\n  - Head: (5,5)  (since I moved UP)\n  - Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  (the first body segment moved to my previous head position, and the tail moved to the previous body position)\n\n- Enemy snake (ID:0) has moved. Since I don't see an updated position, I must infer based on rules. From the last state, enemy was at (3,1) with no body. But in the last board, it was at (2,1)? Let's check the initial input.\n\nUser says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (5,5) Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]\" \u2013 so yes, I am now at (5,5).\n\nEnemy: \"Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\" \u2013 oh, it's at (3,1) now? In the initial description, it was at (3,1), but in the board visualization, it was at (2,1)? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nLooking back:\n\nUser message: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0 - Head: (3,1), Body: none\"\n\nBut in the board state visualization:\n\n\"  1 . . . 0 . . . . . . \"  \u2013 row 1, which is y=1, and at x=3, it shows '0', so head at (3,1).\n\nIn the text: \"1 . . 0 . . . . . .\" \u2013 so x=3, y=1.\n\nPreviously it was at (2,1), but now it's (3,1), meaning it moved RIGHT from (2,1) to (3,1)? But that was last turn's board? No, this is the current state.\n\nThe user provided the current state after my move.\n\nApples are the same: (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), (1,7)\n\nBoard visualization:\n  9 . . . . . A . . . .\n  8 . . . . . . . . . .\n  7 . A A . . . . . . .\n  6 . . . . . . . . . .\n  5 . . . . . 1 . . . .   (my head at (5,5))\n  4 . . . . . T T . . .   (T at (5,4) and (6,4)? But body segments are T for tail? In the board, it says \"T\" for body? Let's read.\n\n\"  4 . . . . . T T . . . \" \u2013 and earlier it says Body: [(5,4), (6,4)], so (5,4) and (6,4) are body segments, labeled T? But T usually means tail. In this board, (6,4) is the tail? Since my body is [(5,4), (6,4)], and (6,4) is the last segment, so it's the tail.\n\nIn the row:\n  4: positions: x=0 to 9: . . . . . T T . . . \nSo (5,4) and (6,4) are both 'T', meaning body or tail.\n\nBut for enemy, at (3,1), it's '0'.\n\nAnd apples: (0,2) is 'A' at row 2, (5,9) at row 9, (0,0) at row 0, (2,7) and (1,7) at row 7.\n\nCurrent board state:\n 9: . . . . .

From (5,5), moving UP to (5,6) reduces the distance to (5,9) to 3 moves.\n\nAfter eating (5,9), I can head towards the cluster at (1,7) and (2,7).\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), which is closer to the bottom apples: (0,0) and (0,2). It might move towards them.\n\nFor example, enemy can move LEFT to (2,1) to get closer to (0,0) or (0,2), or DOWN to (3,0), etc.\n\nBut not a direct threat to me.\n\nOther options: I could consider going for the cluster directly.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (2,7): |\u0394x|=3, |\u0394y|=2, Manhattan distance 5.\n\nPath: e.g., LEFT to (4,5), LEFT to (3,5), UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,6), UP to (2,7) \u2013 5 moves.\n\nTo (5,9): |\u0394x|=0, |\u0394y|=4, so 4 moves up.\n\nSo (5,9) is still closer.\n\nMoving UP now is consistent with the plan.\n\nRIGHT to (6,5) might be possible, but it doesn't help much; it moves me away from both apples.\n\nLEFT to (4,5) is towards the cluster, but not directly up.\n\nSo UP seems best.\n\nBut let's think about body positions.\n\nAfter moving UP to (5,6):\n- New head: (5,6)\n- Body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  (the tail at (6,4) moves to (5,4)? Let's see.\n\nCurrent: head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (6,4)\n\nAfter move UP to (5,6):\n- Head moves to (5,6)\n- The body segment at (5,4) moves to where head was, (5,5)\n- The tail at (6,4) moves to where the first body was, (5,4)\n- So new body: [(5,5), (5,4)]  \u2013 and tail at (5,4)? No: positions: head at (5,6), first body at (5,5), second body (tail) at (5,4)\n\nSince I have two body segments, the tail is now at (5,4).\n\nPreviously, (6,4) was tail, but it moves to (5,4) after the move.\n\n(5,4) was occupied by body, but after I move, the body segments shift.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, if I move UP, I am at (5,6), closer to (5,9).\n\nI could also consider the enemy's potential move.\n\nEnemy is at (3,1), with possible moves: UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0), LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (4,1).\n\nApples at (0,0) and (0,2) are tempting.\n\nFor example, enemy might move LEFT to (2,1) to head towards (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nBut again, not affecting me.\n\nI should stick to my plan.\n\nMove: UP\n\nThen next turn, if I can, continue UP.\n\nBut after two more UP moves, I will be at (5,7), then to (5,8), then (5,9) to eat apple.\n\nAt that point, I grow, so my length increases by one; I gain a point.\n\nThen, from there, I can move LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc., towards (2,7).\n\n(2,7) is at y=7, so from (5,9) to (2,7), I need to decrease x and decrease y.\n\nBut I can do that.\n\nNo need to change strategy now.\n\nSo, I will go UP.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

The apples are at (0,2), (5,9), (0,0), (2,7), and (1,7). My snake (ID 1) has its head at (5,7) with body segments at (5,6) and (5,5). The enemy snake (ID 0) is head-only at (2,0). The board is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n\nFrom my head position (5,7), I can move in four directions:\n- UP to (5,8)\n- DOWN to (5,6) - but that's my body segment, so collision with myself\n- LEFT to (4,7)\n- RIGHT to (6,7)\n\nSo invalid moves: DOWN (to my own body). Valid moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nObjective is to eat apples without dying. Apples near me:\n- (5,9) is two spaces up - if I go UP twice, I can reach it\n- (2,7) and (1,7) are to the left - (2,7) is three left, (1,7) is four left\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,0), far away with no body, so it's not an immediate threat. It might be heading for apples at (0,0) or (0,2).\n\nPotential strategies:\n- Move UP toward (5,9) apple: This is efficient since it's close. After eating it, I grow to length 4. Then I can head left toward the cluster of apples at (1,7)/(2,7).\n- Move LEFT toward the (2,7) and (1,7) apples: This gets me into a denser apple area faster, but (5,9) is closer and easier to reach first.\n- Move RIGHT: No apples directly that way, less optimal.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- UP: (5,8) is empty, then to (5,9) apple. Safe path.\n- LEFT: (4,7) is empty, then I can go to (3,7), (2,7) apple. Also safe as no threats nearby.\n- RIGHT: (6,7) is empty, but no apples in immediate vicinity, so inefficient.\n\nWhy not RIGHT? It doesn't lead to apples quickly. The nearest apples are left or up.\n\nConsidering last move: I moved UP last time (from (5,6) to (5,7)). Continuing UP makes sense to pursue (5,9).\n\nIf I go UP now to (5,8), next turn I can go UP again to (5,9) to eat the apple. Then I'll be at (5,9) with body [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].\n\nAfter that, I can turn left toward (2,7) or (1,7). The cluster at (1,7) and (2,7) is valuable\u2014two apples close together.\n\nEnemy snake at (2,0): It's length 1, so it might eat (0,0) or (0,2) soon, but it doesn't affect me directly at this distance.\n\nNo other snakes or obstacles in my path. Walls aren't a concern here since I'm not near edges.\n\nBest move: UP to continue toward (5,9) apple. It's the most efficient point gain.\n\nFor next turn strategy: After eating (5,9), start moving left toward (2,7). But I'll reassess then based on apple positions and enemy.\n\nSo move: UP\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

From head position (5,8), possible moves are:\n- **UP** to (5,9): There's an apple there! Eating it would grow me to length 4.\n- **DOWN** to (5,7): But that's my own body segment\u2014collision, so death. Invalid move.\n- **LEFT** to (4,8): Empty space.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,8): Also empty.\n\nSo valid moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy considerations**:\n- **UP to (5,9)**: This is highly appealing because it's an immediate apple. Eating it would give me a point and grow my snake. Since I just moved up last turn (from (5,7) to (5,8)), continuing up makes sense for efficiency. After eating, my head would be at (5,9), and my body would be [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].\n- **LEFT to (4,8)**: This moves me toward the cluster of apples at (2,7) and (1,7). From (4,8), I could go down to (4,7) next turn, then left to (3,7), and so on. However, (5,9) is closer and easier to grab first.\n- **RIGHT to (6,8)**: Less optimal. There are no apples nearby in that direction, and it would take me away from the denser apple areas. Only worth it if other moves are risky, but they're not.\n- **Enemy threat**: Snake #0 is at (1,0)\u2014far away and probably heading for (0,0) or (0,2). It has no body yet, so it's weak and slow. I don't need to worry about it for now.\n- **Risk of collision**: Only with myself, and DOWN is blocked. Other paths are clear.\n\n**Why UP is best**:\n1. **Proximity**: (5,9) is one move away. Eating it gives instant reward.\n2. **Growth**: With length 4, I'll be more resilient and can chase other apples aggressively.\n3. **Efficiency**: After eating, I can easily turn toward the left-side apples (e.g., from (5,9), go LEFT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8), etc.).\n4. **No downsides**: The path is safe\u2014no walls, snakes, or self-collision.\n\n**Alternative thoughts**:\n- If I go LEFT now, I might reach (2,7) faster, but it would take at least 3 moves (e.g., LEFT to (4,8), DOWN to (4,7), LEFT to (3,7), LEFT to (2,7)) versus just one move for (5,9). Prioritizing the closest apple is smarter.\n- RIGHT is wasteful\u2014no gain and delays eating.\n\n**For next turn strategy**:\n- After eating (5,9), I'll reassess apple positions. Likely head left toward (2,7) or (1,7). If the enemy snake grows, I'll need to monitor it, but it's low risk for now.\n\nFinal decision: Move UP to claim the apple at (5,9).\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

There is an enemy snake with its head at (0, 0) and a body segment at (1, 0).\n\nI should visualize the board based on the description:\n- My snake head: (5, 9)\n- My body: (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6)\n- Enemy snake head: (0, 0)\n- Enemy body: (1, 0)\n- Apples: (0,2), (2,7), (1,7), (8,0), (3,3)\n\nThe grid is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n\nNow, from my head position (5, 9), I can move in four directions:\n- UP to (5, 10): This is outside the board since y=10 doesn't exist. That would be hitting a wall and I would die.\n- DOWN to (5, 8): This is my own body segment, so collision with myself, death.\n- LEFT to (4, 9): Empty space.\n- RIGHT to (6, 9): Empty space.\n\nSo, only LEFT and RIGHT are valid moves.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0,2) is far, at bottom-left.\n- (2,7) and (1,7) are at middle-left.\n- (8,0) is bottom-right.\n- (3,3) is middle.\n\nThe closest apples seem to be (2,7) and (1,7). From my current position (5,9), moving LEFT towards (4,9) would be a step in that direction. Moving RIGHT would take me away.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0,0) with a body at (1,0). It's small and far away, so not an immediate threat.\n\nLast turn, I moved UP to (5,9). Now, from (5,9), I must avoid UP (wall) and DOWN (body). Only LEFT and RIGHT are possible.\n\nStrategy:\n- LEFT moves me closer to the apples at (2,7) and (1,7). I could plan a path: from (4,9), then down to (4,8), then left to (3,8), down to (3,7), left to (2,7) to eat the apple. That's 4 moves.\n- RIGHT takes me to (6,9), but there are no apples nearby in that direction. The closest apple would be (8,0) or (3,3), both far. Moving right might open up more options later, but it delays eating.\n\nI should prioritize eating an apple soon. My snake has length 4 (head + 3 body segments). Eating an apple would grow me to length 5 and score a point.\n\nThe apples at (2,7) and (1,7) are both at y=7. From (5,9), moving LEFT is better to get closer.\n\nAlternatively, I could go RIGHT to avoid potential conflict, but that seems suboptimal since there are no threats.\n\nAlso, I should note that the board might change as the enemy snake moves.\n\nFor next turn, I can reassess, but for now, LEFT seems like the best move to head towards the cluster of apples at (1,7) and (2,7).\n\nTherefore, I choose LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",
