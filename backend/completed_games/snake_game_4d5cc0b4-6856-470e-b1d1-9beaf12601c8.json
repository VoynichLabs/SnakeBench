The closest apple in terms of straightforward movement appears to be at (4, 5), which is slightly to the left and upward from our position at (5, 1). To reach it directly:\n\n- Moving UP would increase y and bring us closer vertically.\n- Moving LEFT would decrease x, moving towards (4, 1) which is directly below (4, 5).\n\nHowever, to get directly to (4, 5), we'd need to move UP multiple steps and perhaps LEFT as well. But a good approach is to go straight toward an apple that's relatively easily reachable.\n\nThe apple at (4, 9) is quite high; reaching it would require a long upward movement, which is risky if we don't confirm a safe path.\n\nThe apples at (0, 7) and (9, 5) are farther away horizontally, so focusing on the closest accessible apple is better.\n\nSince our snake is at (5, 1), moving UP three times will get us to (5, 4), and then moving LEFT to (4, 4), then UP to (4, 5) would get us to the apple.\n\nBut for the immediate next move, moving UP seems safe and directly toward the apple at (4, 5). Also, moving UP doesn't risk collision with the other snake, which is at (2, 2), and we are below that line.\n\nI should check whether moving UP is safe:\n\n- No walls or other snakes in the immediate vicinity above.\n- No indication of obstacles directly above.\n- Moving UP from (5,1) to (5,2) is safe.\n\nNext turn, I might consider moving horizontally toward the apple.\n\nTherefore, for this move, I choose **UP**.\n\n**Next move: UP**"
