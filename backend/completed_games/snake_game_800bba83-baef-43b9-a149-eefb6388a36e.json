No immediate collision.\n2. **DOWN**: (7, 7) - Check if this is out of bounds (no), or if it collides with enemy or body. No immediate collision.\n3. **LEFT**: (5, 7) - Check if this is out of bounds (no), or if it collides with enemy or body. No immediate collision.\n4. **RIGHT**: (7, 8) - Check if this is out of bounds (no), or if it collides with enemy or body. No immediate collision.\n\nAll four directions are safe immediately.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Closer to Apples**: The closest apple to your head is (6, 6). Moving **DOWN** to (7, 7) is the most direct path to it.\n- **Avoiding Enemy**: The enemy is at (3, 4). If we move down, the enemy will likely move in a direction that might collide with us. However, since we are alone and the enemy is far away, this is not a major concern yet.\n- **Future Options**: Moving down keeps the snake in a more central position, allowing more flexibility for future moves.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Next Turn**: Move down to (7, 7) to eat the apple at (6, 6).\n- **After Eating**: After eating the apple, the snake will have two segments. We should avoid moving directly backward or into the enemy's path.\n- **Enemy Movement**: The enemy is currently at (3, 4). If it moves towards the snake, we should keep a safe distance.\n\n### Final Decision:\n**DOWN**\n\n---\n**Final move:** DOWN",

From the board, (2,3) is empty, but (2,4) is marked as '0' (likely Snake #0's body). Wait, the board shows (2,4) as '0' (Snake #0's body), so Snake #0's head is at (2,3), body at (2,4). Snake #0 has eaten 1 apple (likely at (2,3) or (2,4), but (2,4) is body, so likely (2,3) is empty, but the apple at (2,3) is not marked. Wait, the apples are at (9,9), (4,2), (9,3), (1,4), (0,2). So Snake #0 has eaten 1 apple, but we don't know which one. From the board, Snake #0's head is at (2,3), body at (2,4). Snake #0's body is at (2,4), which is not an apple, so likely Snake #0 ate an apple at (2,3) or another apple nearby. But (2,3) is empty, so maybe Snake #0 ate (4,2) or another apple. This is unclear, but we can assume Snake #0 is safe and not threatening us directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Immediate Safety Check**\nYour snake is currently:\n- Head: (6,5)\n- Body: [(6,6)]\nIf you move DOWN, new head will be (7,5).\nCheck for collisions:\n- Your body is at (6,6). Moving DOWN to (7,5) does not overlap with body or enemy.\n- Enemy snake is at (2,3) and (2,4). No overlap.\n- Board boundaries: (7,5) is within 0-9 for both x and y.\n\nNo immediate death risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Proximity**\nClosest apple is at (6,6), which is your tail. If you move DOWN, your head will be at (7,5), and your body will shift to (6,6) and (7,6). The apple at (6,6) will be eaten, and you grow by 1 segment (body becomes [(6,6), (7,6)]).\n\nOther apples are farther away:\n- (9,9): far\n- (4,2): far\n- (9,3): far\n- (1,4): far\n- (0,2): far\n\nSo moving DOWN is the fastest way to eat the closest apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat**\nEnemy snake is at (2,3) and (2,4). It is stationary and far from your path. No immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n### **Future Flexibility**\nMoving DOWN keeps your head at (7,5), body at (6,6) and (7,6). This position is central and allows easy access to other apples if needed. Avoiding tight corners is not an issue here.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n**Turn 2:** Eat the apple at (6,6). After growth, avoid moving backward or directly toward the enemy.\n**Turn 3:** Prioritize apples at (9,3) or (2,3) while keeping distance from the enemy. Snake #0 is stationary, so no immediate threat.\n**Turn 4+:** Expand horizontally/vertically to maximize coverage; avoid tight corners.\n\n---\n\n### **Decision**\nThe move **DOWN** is safe, moves you toward the closest apple, and keeps future options open.\n\nDOWN",

A . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n- Snake #0's body is at (1,3) and (2,3).\n- Snake #0 is currently stationary.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Eliminate Immediate Threats\n- **Move Down (Y+1)**: Head moves to (6, 4). This is the tail's position, so moving down would collide with your own body. **Dead move.**\n- **Move Up (Y-1)**: Head moves to (6, 2). Check if this is occupied by Snake #0 or its body:\n  - Snake #0's body is at (1,3) and (2,3). No overlap. Also, no immediate threat.\n  - Check if this is safe: No, because Snake #0's head is at (1,4), and moving up would not immediately kill you, but we need to consider future threats.\n- **Move Left (X-1)**: Head moves to (5, 3). Check for Snake #0's body: No overlap. Safe.\n- **Move Right (X+1)**: Head moves to (7, 3). Check for Snake #0's body: No overlap. Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves\n#### Move Up (Y-1) to (6, 2):\n- **Pros**: Moves toward the apple at (9,3) and (4,2). This is a good direction to expand vertically.\n- **Cons**: Snake #0 is at (1,4), and moving up could expose your tail to potential future threats if Snake #0 moves aggressively. However, Snake #0 is stationary now, so this is not an immediate threat.\n\n#### Move Left (X-1) to (5, 3):\n- **Pros**: Moves toward the apple at (4,2) and (0,2). This is a good direction to expand horizontally.\n- **Cons**: Snake #0 is at (1,4), and moving left could expose your tail to Snake #0's potential future moves. However, Snake #0 is stationary, so this is not an immediate threat.\n\n#### Move Right (X+1) to (7, 3):\n- **Pros**: Moves toward the apple at (9,3) and (9,9). This is a good direction to expand horizontally toward the rightmost apples.\n- **Cons**: Snake #0 is at (1,4), and moving right does not immediately threaten Snake #0, but it might not be the most optimal direction for immediate apple collection.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider Snake #0's Potential Moves\nSnake #0 is stationary now, but it could move toward your tail or head. Your tail is at (6,4). Snake #0's head is at (1,4), and its body is at (1,3) and (2,3). If Snake #0 moves down, it could potentially reach (2,4) or (1,5) next turn, but it's unlikely to immediately threaten you.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Prioritize Apple Collection\n- The apple at (9,3) is reachable via either RIGHT or UP.\n- The apple at (4,2) and (0,2) are reachable via LEFT.\n\nGiven that, moving UP to (6,2) is the best immediate move to get closer to the apple at (9,3) and (4,2).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Long-Term Strategy Note:\n**Turn 5:**\n- Prioritize moving toward the apple at (4,2) or (0,2) by choosing a direction that maximizes coverage without cornering. Snake #0 is stationary, so we can safely expand toward these apples.\n- Monitor Snake #0\u2019s potential moves and adjust accordingly.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Your tail is at (6,4), so no immediate collision risk from Snake #0\u2019s body.\n- Snake #0\u2019s head is at (0,3). If it moves right (e.g., to (1,3)), it could threaten your tail at (6,4) if you move down or left in a way that exposes your tail to its body.\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Moves & Safety Checks**\n1. **UP (Y+1) \u2192 (5,5)**\n   - **Risk:** Snake #0\u2019s head at (0,3) could move diagonally (e.g., right-up to (1,4)) and threaten your tail at (6,4) if you move down next turn. Also, moving up reduces your ability to reach (4,2) or (9,3) in the future.\n   - **Safety:** Safe from Snake #0\u2019s body, but not ideal for long-term strategy.\n\n2. **DOWN (Y-1) \u2192 (5,3)**\n   - **Risk:** Collides with tail at (6,4) if you move down (since your body is ordered head-to-tail, moving down would require the tail to move backward, which is invalid).\n   - **Safety:** **Immediately invalid** (would die).\n\n3. **LEFT (X-1) \u2192 (4,4)**\n   - **Risk:** Snake #0\u2019s head at (0,3) could move right (e.g., to (1,3)) and threaten your tail at (6,4) if you move down next turn.

There is no overlap, so this move is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Revised Strategy & Move Selection**\n- **Immediate Goal:** Secure the apple at **(4, 2)** (already eaten) and prioritize **(9,3)** or **(0,2)**.\n- **Current Apple Proximity:**\n  - (9,3) is reachable via RIGHT or DOWN.\n  - (0,2) is reachable via LEFT or UP.\n- **Snake #0\u2019s Potential Threat:** If it moves right to (1,3), it could threaten your tail at (6,4) if you move down next turn. Thus, avoid moves that expose your tail to Snake #0\u2019s body.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **LEFT to (4,4)** is the safest and most strategic choice because:\n  - It keeps your tail at (6,4) safe from Snake #0\u2019s body.\n  - It opens paths toward (0,2) or (9,3) without cornering yourself.\n  - It avoids immediate collision risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (for future self):**\n**Turn 7-12 Plan:**\n- **Immediate Goal:** Secure the apple at **(9,3)** by moving rightward (X+1) to **(6,4)** or **(7,4)**.\n- **Next Steps:**\n  - If I eat **(9,3)**, I\u2019ll prioritize expanding toward **(0,2)** or **(4,6)** next turn, avoiding Snake #0\u2019s potential ambush (its body is at **(1,3)-(2,3)**; moving diagonally left/up keeps me safe).\n  - If I don\u2019t eat **(9,3)**, I\u2019ll shift toward **(0,2)** via leftward moves, but only if Snake #0 doesn\u2019t block the path.\n- **Risk Mitigation:**\n  - Snake #0 is stationary now, but its head at **(1,3)** could threaten my tail at **(6,4)** if I move down.

Wait, no\u2014the last rationale says you moved RIGHT to (1,5) on Turn 12, and the apples eaten were already accounted for. Clarifying: Your snake has **1 apple** remaining to collect, and the last apple eaten was not (9,3) but another. The board shows (9,3) is still an apple. Wait, the \"Apples collected\" line says \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 1,\" implying you have **1 apple eaten so far** (likely (4,7) or another). The apples at (9,9), (9,3), (4,6), (4,7), (3,9) remain, so (9,3) is still available.\n  - **Last move:** RIGHT to (1,5).\n\n- **Snake #0:**\n  - Head: **(4, 3)**\n  - Body: [(4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)]\n  - Apples: **4** (eaten at least 3, since it\u2019s alive and has 4 apples).\n\n#### **Immediate Risks**\n1. **Your body at (0,5) is directly behind your head at (1,5).**\n   - Moving **DOWN to (1,4)** would place your head directly behind your tail (invalid move\u2014death).\n   - Moving **UP to (1,6)** is safe but doesn\u2019t progress toward apples.\n   - Moving **LEFT to (0,5)** is safe but would leave you vulnerable to Snake #0\u2019s body at (4,2) or (4,1) if it expands downward.\n   - Moving **RIGHT to (2,5)** is safe but risks Snake #0\u2019s head at (4,3) blocking (9,3) if it moves right.\n\n2. **Snake #0\u2019s head at (4,3) is moving rightward (toward (5,3) or (4,4)).**\n   - If it moves right, it may block (9,3) or (4,2) in future turns.\n   - Its body occupies (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). If it expands right, it will likely move to (4,3) \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 etc., threatening (9,3).\n\n3. **Apple priorities:**\n   - **(9,3)** is the closest and most valuable (highest x-coordinate).\n   - **(4,7)** is reachable but requires a pivot left or up.\n   - **(3,9)** is far but could be a long-term goal.\n\n#### **Safe Moves and Priorities**\n- **UP to (1,6):**\n  - Safe, but doesn\u2019t progress toward (9,3). Snake #0\u2019s head is still far enough that this is viable, but not optimal.\n- **RIGHT to (2,5):**\n  - Advances toward (9,3). Snake #0\u2019s head is at (4,3), so it\u2019s unlikely to block (9,3) immediately. If Snake #0 doesn\u2019t move right, this could be safe.\n- **LEFT to (0,5):**\n  - Safe but risks Snake #0\u2019s body at (4,2) if it expands downward.\n- **DOWN to (1,4):**\n  - Invalid (would hit tail).\n\n**Best move:** **UP to (1,6)** is safer than RIGHT if Snake #0 moves right, but RIGHT is more aggressive toward (9,3). Given Snake #0\u2019s head is at (4,3), it\u2019s unlikely to block (9,3) immediately, so **RIGHT to (2,5)** is the best choice to advance toward (9,3).\n\n#### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n**Turn 13/150 Plan:**\n1. **Primary Goal:** Eat (9,3) before Snake #0 does.\n   - If Snake #0 moves right, we must pivot UP or LEFT to avoid collision.\n   - If Snake #0 doesn\u2019t move right, we can continue RIGHT toward (9,3).\n2. **Secondary Goal:** Avoid Snake #0\u2019s body at (4,2) or (4,1) if it expands downward.\n3. **Snake #0\u2019s likely path:** It will expand rightward toward (9,3). If it doesn\u2019t, we can pivot UP or LEFT.\n4. **Apple priorities:**\n   - (9,3) > (4,7) > (3,9).\n5. **Safe follow-up moves:**\n   - If we move RIGHT to (2,5), next move could be UP to (2,6) or RIGHT to (3,5).\n   - If Snake #0 moves right, pivot UP to (1,6) or LEFT to (0,5).\n\n**Key Risks to Avoid:**\n- Moving DOWN (invalid).\n- Moving LEFT if Snake #0\u2019s body is expanding downward.\n- Moving RIGHT if Snake #0\u2019s head is at (4,3) and it moves right to (5,3).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move:**\nUP",

We must **avoid moving RIGHT if Snake #0 moves right** (risk of collision).\n   - **(4,7)** is reachable via UP or LEFT but requires a pivot.\n   - **(3,9)** is far but could be a long-term goal if we avoid immediate threats.\n\n3. **Your Current State:**\n   - Head at (1,6), body at (1,5). Moving **UP to (1,7)** is safe but doesn\u2019t progress toward (9,3).\n   - Moving **RIGHT to (2,6)** is safer than UP if Snake #0 doesn\u2019t move right, but UP is safer if it does.\n   - Moving **LEFT to (0,6)** risks Snake #0\u2019s body at (4,2) or (4,1) if it expands downward.\n\n**Immediate Plan (Turn 14):**\n- **Primary Goal:** Eat (9,3) before Snake #0 does.\n  - If Snake #0 moves right, pivot **UP to (1,7)** to avoid collision.\n  - If Snake #0 doesn\u2019t move right, move **RIGHT to (2,6)** to advance toward (9,3).\n- **Secondary Goal:** Avoid Snake #0\u2019s body at (4,2) or (4,1) if it expands downward.\n- **Apple Priorities:** (9,3) > (4,7) > (3,9).\n\n**Follow-Up Moves:**\n- If we move **UP to (1,7)**, next move could be **RIGHT to (2,7)** or **UP to (2,7)**.\n- If we move **RIGHT to (2,6)**, next move could be **UP to (2,7)** or **RIGHT to (3,6)**.\n\n**Key Risks to Avoid:**\n- Moving DOWN (invalid).\n- Moving LEFT if Snake #0\u2019s body is expanding downward.\n- Moving RIGHT if Snake #0\u2019s head is at (4,3) and it moves right to (5,3).\n\n---\n**Final Move:**\nUP",

LEFT also risks a potential head-on with the enemy, which could end the game in our favor given our apples.\n\nPlan: Head toward the left apple line while keeping escape options open.\n\nLEFT",
