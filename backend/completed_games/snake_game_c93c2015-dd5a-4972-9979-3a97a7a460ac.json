It will move next turn, but it's far away and unlikely to pose an immediate threat.\n- **Snake Growth**: With no body, the snake is vulnerable to collisions, so expanding the body is crucial.\n\n### Rationalizing the Move:\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (8, 2) is the most direct and advantageous move because it allows immediate apple consumption, which is critical for growth and score.\n- This move also keeps the snake in a position where it can expand safely in the future.\n\n**Final Move: RIGHT**",

Watch for enemy snake\u2019s next move (likely toward (1,9) or (0,8) to block vertical paths).\n3. **Long-Term (Turns 6+):** Focus on cornering apples near (8,4) or (9,1). Avoid stagnation\u2014always leave 2+ safe directions open. If enemy advances aggressively, prioritize vertical expansion (e.g., (8,3) or (7,1)) to create space.\n4. **Risk Management:** Never move into the cell (8,1) or (7,1) if the enemy could reach it in 1 turn (e.g., from (0,9) via DOWN). Monitor apple depletion\u2014if only 1 apple remains, prioritize reaching it first.\n5. **Snake Growth:** After eating (8,2), aim for (9,2) or (8,3) to avoid backtracking.

Thus, prioritize moving toward (8,4) or (1,2) if (9,8) is unreachable.\n3. **Body Alignment:** Keep snake body straight (vertical) to avoid collisions with Snake #0\u2019s potential expansion. Avoid diagonal moves unless forced.\n4. **Watch for Collisions:** If Snake #0\u2019s head reaches (5,9) or (4,9) by Turn 12, its body may extend into (9,8) or (8,4).

It avoids Snake #0\u2019s potential expansion path (e.g., (5,9) or (4,9)) and keeps the snake\u2019s body aligned vertically.\n- **No immediate collision risk:** Snake #0\u2019s body is at (5,9) and (4,9), which does not overlap with our path. Our tail is at (8,0), so moving UP is safe.\n- **Future flexibility:** This move leaves room to pivot toward (8,4) or (1,2) if (9,8) is blocked by Snake #0. It also avoids trapping the snake in a corner.\n- **Enemy threat:** Snake #0\u2019s next move is uncertain, but its expansion is slow.

Re-reading the problem:\n- The last move was **UP** (from Turn 12 to Turn 13), meaning the head moved from (9, 4) to (8, 4) to (7, 4) \u2192 Wait, no. The board state shows the head at (9, 3) now, meaning the last move was likely **DOWN** (from (9, 4) to (9, 3)).\n\n**Correction:**\nThe last move was **DOWN** (from (9, 4) to (9, 3)), but the rationale says \"UP\" for Turn 12. This suggests the snake moved UP from (9, 3) to (8, 3) on Turn 13, but the board state shows the head at (9, 3) now, meaning the last move was **DOWN** (from (9, 4) to (9, 3)).\n\n**Reconciliation:**\nThe board state shows the head at (9, 3), so the last move was **DOWN** (from (9, 4) to (9, 3)). The rationale for Turn 12 was to move UP to (8, 1) and (7, 1), but this contradicts the current state. Likely, the snake moved DOWN from (9, 4) to (9, 3) on Turn 13.\n\n**Current Board State:**\n- Snake #1: Head (9, 3), Body [(9, 2), (9, 1)]\n- Snake #0: Head (8, 8), Body [(9, 8), (9, 9)]\n- Apples: (1, 2), (8, 4), (1, 3), (5, 9), (3, 9)\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1. **UP**: (9, 3) \u2192 (8, 3)\n   - Check for collisions: Snake #0\u2019s body is at (9, 8) and (9, 9). No overlap.\n   - Snake #0\u2019s head is at (8, 8). Moving UP to (8, 3) is safe.\n   - Snake #1\u2019s body is at (9, 2) and (9, 1). No overlap.\n   - Follow-up moves: (7, 3) is safe, but Snake #0 may block (8, 4) or (8, 5) next turn.\n\n2. **DOWN**: (9, 3) \u2192 (9, 4)\n   - Check for collisions: Snake #0\u2019s body is at (9, 8) and (9, 9). No overlap.\n   - Snake #1\u2019s body is at (9, 2) and (9, 1). No overlap.\n   - Follow-up moves: (9, 5) is safe, but Snake #0 may block (9, 4) or (9, 5) next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT**: (9, 3) \u2192 (8, 3)\n   - Same as UP, but now snake is moving left. Snake #0\u2019s head is at (8, 8), so no immediate collision.\n   - Follow-up moves: (7, 3) is safe, but Snake #0 may block (8, 4) or (8, 5).\n\n4. **RIGHT**: (9, 3) \u2192 (9, 4)\n   - Snake #0\u2019s head is at (8, 8), so no immediate collision.\n   - Follow-up moves: (9, 5) is safe, but Snake #0 may block (9, 4) or (9, 5).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Snake #0\u2019s head is at (8, 8), and its body is at (9, 8) and (9, 9). It is expanding downward.\n- Snake #1\u2019s body is vertical at (9, 1) to (9, 3). Moving UP or LEFT keeps the snake aligned vertically.\n- The closest apple is (8, 4). Snake #0\u2019s head is at (8, 8), so it cannot block (8, 4) immediately.\n- Moving UP or LEFT is safer than DOWN or RIGHT, as Snake #0\u2019s expansion is downward.\n\n**Best Move:**\n**UP** (to (8, 3)) is the safest move, as it keeps the snake aligned vertically and avoids Snake #0\u2019s expansion path. Moving LEFT is also safe but less optimal for future growth.\n\n---\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for Turn 14:**\n1. **Immediate Goal (Turn 14):** Confirm eating (8, 4) apple by moving UP to (7, 3) and then UP to (6, 3) on Turn 15. This secures the closest apple while minimizing Snake #0\u2019s expansion risk.\n2. **Snake #0\u2019s Path:** If Snake #0 moves toward (5, 9) or (4, 9) next, its body will block (9, 8) by Turn 14. Prioritize moving toward (8, 4) or (1, 2) if (9, 8) is unreachable.\n3. **Body Alignment:** Keep snake body straight (vertical) to avoid collisions with Snake #0\u2019s potential expansion. Avoid diagonal moves unless forced.\n4. **Watch for Collisions:** If Snake #0\u2019s head reaches (5, 9) or (4, 9) by Turn 13, its body may extend into (9, 8) or (8, 4).

No immediate overlap.\n     - Snake #0\u2019s head at (8, 8) does not block (8, 3).\n     - Snake #1\u2019s body is vertical at (9, 1)\u2013(9, 3).

Less optimal than UP.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (8, 3))**\n   - **Collision Check:**\n     - Same as UP (no immediate overlap).\n   - **Follow-Up Moves:**\n     - Next turn: (7, 3) is safe, but Snake #0\u2019s head at (8, 8) may block (8, 3) if it moves toward (8, 7) or (8, 6).\n     - Less predictable than UP, as Snake #0\u2019s expansion is downward.\n   - **Apple Proximity:**\n     - Same as UP (one move closer to (8, 4)).\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (9, 4))**\n   - **Collision Check:**\n     - Same as DOWN (no immediate overlap).\n   - **Follow-Up Moves:**\n     - Next turn: (9, 5) is safe, but Snake #0\u2019s expansion is downward, so no immediate threat.\n     - Less optimal for apple proximity.\n\n#### **Key Risks & Mitigations:**\n- **Snake #0\u2019s Expansion:** If it moves toward (9, 8) \u2192 (9, 7) \u2192 (9, 6), it may block (9, 3) or (8, 3) in 2\u20133 turns.\n  - **Solution:** Moving UP or LEFT keeps the snake\u2019s vertical alignment, reducing collision risk.\n- **Apple Priority:** (8, 4) is the closest and most valuable. Moving UP or LEFT secures the fastest path to it.\n\n#### **Best Move:**\n**UP (to (8, 3))**\n- Keeps the snake aligned vertically, minimizing Snake #0\u2019s expansion risk.\n- Brings the snake one step closer to (8, 4), maximizing apple-eating potential.\n- Follow-up moves (e.g., (7, 3)) remain safe, and Snake #0 cannot block (8, 3) immediately.\n\n---\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for Turn 15+:**\n1. **Immediate Goal:** Eat (8, 4) on Turn 15 by moving UP to (7, 3) and then UP to (6, 3).

Let\u2019s simplify: (8, 6) to (8, 4) is not directly possible. The closest is via (7, 6) \u2192 (6, 6) \u2192 (5, 6) \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (4, 2) \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 (4, 0) is not correct. The shortest path is (8, 6) \u2192 (7, 6) \u2192 (7, 5) \u2192 (7, 4). This is a valid path to (7, 4), but not (8, 4). The correct shortest path to (8, 4) is (8, 6) \u2192 (8, 5) \u2192 (8, 4). This is one move down, but we are currently at (8, 6). So, moving down to (8, 5) and then down to (8, 4) would be two moves. However, we need to check if Snake #0 blocks this path.\n\n### **Enemy Snake #0 State:**\n- **Head:** (5, 9)\n- **Body:** [(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)]\n- **Movement:** Snake #0 moved LEFT from (6, 9) to (5, 9) on Turn 17. It is now at (5, 9) and will likely move toward (4, 9) or (5, 8) next turn.\n\n### **Safe Moves Analysis:**\n1. **UP (to (7, 6))**\n   - **Collision Check:**\n     - Snake #0\u2019s head at (5, 9) does not block (7, 6).\n     - Snake #0\u2019s body at (6, 9), (7, 9) does not overlap.\n     - Snake #1\u2019s body at (9, 5) and (9, 6) does not overlap.\n   - **Follow-Up Moves:**\n     - Next turn: (6, 6) is safe.\n     - Snake #0\u2019s head at (4, 9) or (5, 8) does not block (6, 6).\n   - **Apple Proximity:**\n     - Moving UP to (7, 6) then (6, 6) can reach (5, 6) or (4, 6) next turn, but (8, 4) is still not directly reachable in one move.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (8, 5))**\n   - **Collision Check:**\n     - Snake #0\u2019s head at (5, 9) does not block (8, 5).\n     - Snake #0\u2019s body does not overlap.\n     - Snake #1\u2019s tail at (9, 5) does not overlap with (8, 5).\n   - **Follow-Up Moves:**\n     - Next turn: (8, 4) is an apple! This is a direct hit.\n   - **Apple Proximity:**\n     - Directly eating (8, 4) is optimal.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (7, 6))**\n   - Same as UP in terms of collision checks and follow-up safety.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (9, 7))**\n   - **Collision Check:**\n     - Snake #0\u2019s head at (5, 9) does not block (9, 7).\n     - Snake #0\u2019s body does not overlap.\n     - Snake #1\u2019s body at (9, 6) and (9, 5) does not overlap with (9, 7).\n   - **Follow-Up Moves:**\n     - Next turn: (9, 8) is safe, but Snake #0 may threaten (9, 7) if it expands vertically.\n\n### **Key Risks & Mitigations:**\n- **Snake #0\u2019s Expansion:** Snake #0 is now at (5, 9) and will likely move toward (4, 9) or (5, 8). This does not immediately threaten (8, 5) or (8, 4).\n- **Apple Priority:** Eating (8, 4) directly on Turn 17 is the best immediate win.\n\n### **Best Move:**\n**DOWN (to (8, 5))**\n- Directly eating the apple at (8, 4) next turn by moving down to (8, 5) and then down to (8, 4) is optimal.\n- This move is safe and maximizes immediate gains.\n\n---\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:**\n- **Immediate Goal:** Secure (8, 4) on Turn 18 by moving DOWN to (8, 5) and then DOWN to (8, 4).\n- **Snake #0\u2019s Path:** If Snake #0 does not block (8, 5), continue vertically to avoid its expansion.\n- **Body Alignment:** Maintain a straight vertical path to avoid self-collisions.\n- **Watch for (1, 2):** If Snake #0 is eliminated, prioritize (1, 2) for growth.\n\nDOWN",
