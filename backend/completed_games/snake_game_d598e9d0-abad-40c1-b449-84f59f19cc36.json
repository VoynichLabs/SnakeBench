Since I'm currently at (1, 2), I can move up (to (1, 1)), down (to (1, 3)), left (to (0, 2)), or right (to (2, 2)).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. The closest apple is at (9, 1), but it's too far away and moving towards it would put me at risk of colliding with the wall. The next closest apples are at (7, 1) and (5, 6). Moving towards (7, 1) would require going left, but that would put me closer to snake #1, which is not ideal. Moving towards (5, 6) would require going right, which seems like a safer option as there are no other snakes in that direction.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the long-term strategy. Since there are apples at (9, 8) and (4, 8), it might be beneficial to move towards the upper part of the board to reach those apples in the future.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will move towards the apple at (5, 6) for now, but I will keep an eye on the upper part of the board for future moves.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on the upper part of the board and try to move towards the apples there when the opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
