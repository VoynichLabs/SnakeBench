          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide the next move for my snake. The current position of my head is (1,5). The body is (1,4). The apples available are at (5,8), (2,6), (9,0), (9,9), (9,1). The last move was UP. Wait, the board shows that the previous direction was UP. Let me check the last move info. Yes, last move was UP.\n\nSo, the snake moved UP last time. That would take it from where it was to (1,5). Now, possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT again. Let me look at each direction.\n\nFirst, check which moves are safe. The snake's body is at (1,4) and head is (1,5). So moving in a direction must not result in the head colliding with the body.\n\nIf I move UP again: the new head would be (1,6). The body is at (1,4). So moving to (1,6) is safe, but need to check if other snakes' bodies are in that cell. The enemy snake's head is at (8,6). But their body is none. So (1,6) is empty. So UP is possible.\n\nIf I move DOWN: new head is (1,4). But my body is currently at (1,4). Wait, because when moving, the body follows. Wait, the movement is simultaneous. So after moving DOWN, the new head is (1,4), and the new body would be the previous head position, which is (1,5). So the head moves into the cell that was the previous body? Wait, no. Let me think. The current body is [(1,4)]. So when moving DOWN, the head would move to (1,4), which was the body's position. So the head would be colliding with the body. That would kill me. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: new head would be (0,5). Need to check if that cell is in the body. The body is (1,4). So no collision. Also, check if it's off the board. x=0 is within 0-9. So safe. But need to check other snakes. The enemy's head is at (8,6). So (0,5) is safe. So LEFT is possible.\n\nRIGHT: new head is (2,5). Check body. The body is (1,4), so no collision. Also check if any other snake's body is there. The enemy's body is none. So safe. Also, check if moving right is allowed.\n\nNow, the other condition is moving into another snake's body. The enemy's head is at (8,6), and their body is none. So the only possible collision is if another snake's head moves into my body. But in this case, since the enemy has no body, moving into their head? Wait, no. The collision is if their head moves into my body. So if the enemy's head moves into (1,5) or (1,4), but since I'm moving, but the enemy's head is moving to some direction. But since I can't predict their move yet, maybe I should assume that if moving into their head's current position would be a problem? Or maybe not, because they will move this turn. So perhaps the collision is only if their head moves into my body after this turn. But since all moves are simultaneous, during this turn, if my head moves into their current body (which is none in this case) or their previous position? Hmm, maybe I should consider that during this move, the enemy snake's head could move into my body. But since I can't know their next move, maybe I should avoid positions that are close to their possible moves. But in this case, the enemy's current head is at (8,6). So if I move into (8,6) this turn, but that's unlikely since they have to move as well. But maybe better to avoid that area. However, my current possible moves are (1,6), (0,5), (2,5). None of these are near (8,6), so maybe that's not a problem. So LEFT, RIGHT, and UP are possible.\n\nBut moving UP again would add a new body segment at (1,5), and the new head at (1,6). But the previous direction was UP. So moving UP again would be in a straight line. That's safe as long as there's no obstacle. But maybe moving in different directions could help avoid getting stuck.\n\nLooking at the apples: the closest one is (2,6) which is two cells to the right and up from the current position. Wait, current head is (1,5). So (2,6) is one right and one up. So to reach that apple, moving RIGHT and then UP, or UP then RIGHT. Alternatively, maybe moving RIGHT now would bring me closer. Let's see. If I move RIGHT to (2,5), then next move could be UP to (2,6) to get the apple. That would be two moves. Alternatively, moving UP to (1,6), then RIGHT to (2,6). Either way, possible. But maybe moving RIGHT now is better to get closer. Alternatively, moving UP could also be good if there's an apple in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, check which apples are reachable. The apple at (2,6) is two moves away (assuming moving in a straight line). The apple at (5,8) is further away. The others are further. So maybe (2,6) is the closest. So moving towards that apple would be a good strategy.\n\nSo, possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the direction. The last move was UP. If I move UP again, I'm going straight. That's efficient but might not help in reaching the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT would take me towards the apple. Let's think about the path. From (1,5) to (2,5) (RIGHT), then next move UP to (2,6) to get the apple. That's two moves. Alternatively, moving UP to (1,6), then RIGHT to (2,6). Either way, same number of moves. But perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because the apple is at (2,6), which is one step right and up from current position. So moving RIGHT now brings me to x=2, which is closer to the apple's x-coordinate. Then UP next would get the apple. So that's a possible path.\n\nBut also, need to check if moving RIGHT is safe. The new head would be (2,5). The body would be the previous head (1,5). So the body is now [(1,5)]. So moving to (2,5) is safe. No collision. So RIGHT is a valid move.\n\nWhat about the enemy snake? The enemy's head is at (8,6). If I move right to (2,5), that's not near their position. So no collision risk. Also, if they move, their direction is unknown. But since they have no body, their only possible collision is if their head moves into my body. But again, since I can't predict their move, maybe it's safer to focus on my own survival.\n\nSo between UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each.\n\nUP: moving to (1,6). Then next move could be RIGHT to (2,6) to get the apple. So two moves. Alternatively, moving UP again would take me higher, but maybe not necessary.\n\nLEFT: (0,5). Then maybe next move could be UP or RIGHT. But not sure. The apple at (2,6) is two steps right from (0,5), so that's three moves. Not the best path.\n\nRIGHT: (2,5). Then next move UP to (2,6) to get the apple. So that's two moves. That seems efficient.\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT. Which is better? Let's think about the safety of the next moves. If I move RIGHT now, then next move UP would be possible. Are there any obstacles in that path? The apple at (2,6) is the target. So moving RIGHT then UP would reach it. But need to check if there are any obstacles in (2,5) or (2,6). From the board layout:\n\nRow 5 is where the head is now. The apple (5,8) is in row 5, column 8. But the path to (2,6) is in row 2, column 6. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 2: 2 . . . . . . . . . A (assuming the A is the apple at (2,6)? Wait, the apples are listed as (5,8), (2,6), (9,0), (9,9), (9,1). So (2,6) is an apple. The board's line for row 2 is \"2 . . . . . . . . . A\" \u2014 that A is probably the apple at (2,6). So moving to (2,6) would collect that apple.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (2,5) and then UP to (2,6) would collect the apple. That's good. So RIGHT is a good move now.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,6), then RIGHT to (2,6). Also possible.\n\nBut which direction is better? Let's check the possible follow-up moves after each direction.\n\nIf I move UP now: new head (1,6), body [(1,5)]. Next move could be RIGHT to (2,6) to get the apple. That's two moves. But after moving UP, the body is (1,5). So moving RIGHT would be safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now: new head (2,5), body [(1,5)]. Next move UP to (2,6) to get the apple. That's also two moves. So both paths are possible.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's moving towards the apple's x-coordinate. The apple is at x=2, so moving right to x=2 is directly aligning. Then moving up would get the apple. So that's efficient.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the direction changes. If I keep moving in the same direction (UP), that's a straight line. Changing direction might be better to avoid getting stuck in a corridor or something. But in this case, moving RIGHT is a new direction, which could be good.\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT to (0,5), but that's moving away from the apple. Not ideal.\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT. Which is safer? Let's check for any possible collisions with other snakes. The enemy's head is at (8,6). If I move RIGHT to (2,5), that's not near them. If I move UP to (1,6), also not near. So both are safe.\n\nAnother factor: the last move was UP. If I move RIGHT, that's a turn. Which is okay. The rules don't penalize direction changes. So either is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's a direct path towards the apple. So I should choose RIGHT.\n\nWait, but what about the body collision? Let me confirm. Current body is [(1,4)]. If I move RIGHT to (2,5), the new body will be the previous head (1,5). So the head is at (2,5), body at (1,5). No collision. Then next move UP to (2,6). The body would be (2,5), so moving to (2,6) is safe. So that's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP now would take the head to (1,6), body at (1,5). Then moving RIGHT to (2,6). Also valid.\n\nSo both directions are safe. Which one is better? Maybe moving RIGHT is better because it's moving towards the apple's x-coordinate. So I'll go with RIGHT.\nRIGHT",
