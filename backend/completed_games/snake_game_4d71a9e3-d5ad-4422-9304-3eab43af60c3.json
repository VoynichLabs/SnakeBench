Death if I go there.\n- **LEFT**: to (-1,2) - outside board (wall), instant death.\n- **RIGHT**: to (1,2) - empty space, safe.\n\nApples I can target:\n- (0,8) is directly above me on the left edge - would require moving up several times.\n- (1,7) is close in terms of Manhattan distance - 1 right then 5 up from (0,2).\n- (2,3) is very close - just 2 right and 1 up from (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Snake #0 at (7,2) has no body, so it's small like me. It could move in any direction. Possible threats:\n  - If it moves left toward (6,2), (5,2), etc., it could eventually conflict, but not immediately.\n  - The apple at (2,3) might attract both of us. But from (7,2) to (2,3) is 5 left and 1 up - it would take at least 5 moves, so no immediate danger.\n  - Since the enemy has no body, collisions only occur if we head to the same spot at the same time. Right now, no risk.\n\nImmediate priorities:\n1. **Avoid death**: DOWN and LEFT are suicide. Eliminated.\n2. **Grow safely**: UP and RIGHT are options. UP to (0,3) is safe (empty) but no apple. RIGHT to (1,2) is also safe but no apple there either.\n3. **Path to nearest apple**: \n   - The apple at (2,3) is very close - if I go RIGHT to (1,2) now, then next turn I can go RIGHT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3) to eat it. That's 2 moves away.\n   - Apple at (1,7): If I go UP now to (0,3), then I'd need to go RIGHT later, but it's farther (5 up from (0,3) to (0,8) or detour to (1,7)).\n   - (0,8) is 6 moves up, but I'd be moving along the edge - risky long-term if enemy cuts me off.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If I go RIGHT to (1,2): \n  - Puts me closer to (2,3) apple.\n  - Avoids trapping myself on the left edge.\n  - Gives more flexibility for future moves.\n- If I go UP to (0,3):\n  - Keeps me on the edge, which might limit escape routes later.\n  - Not progress toward any apple except (0,8), which is inefficient.\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turn:\n- After RIGHT, head to (2,3) apple. Then consider (1,7) or (3,8) based on enemy movement.\n- If enemy moves toward (2,3), I might need to adjust.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is the best move. It positions me toward the dense apple cluster (2,3 and 1,7) while avoiding immediate danger. UP is safe but less strategic.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>",

Death if I go there.\n- **LEFT**: to (-1,2) - outside board (wall), instant death.\n- **RIGHT**: to (1,2) - empty space, safe.\n\nApples I can target:\n- (0,8) is directly above me on the left edge - would require moving up several times.\n- (1,7) is close in terms of Manhattan distance - 1 right then 5 up from (0,2).\n- (2,3) is very close - just 2 right and 1 up from (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Snake #0 at (7,2) has no body, so it's small like me. It could move in any direction. Possible threats:\n  - If it moves left toward (6,2), (5,2), etc., it could eventually conflict, but not immediately.\n  - The apple at (2,3) might attract both of us. But from (7,2) to (2,3) is 5 left and 1 up - it would take at least 5 moves, so no immediate danger.\n  - Since the enemy has no body, collisions only occur if we head to the same spot at the same time. Right now, no risk.\n\nImmediate priorities:\n1. **Avoid death**: DOWN and LEFT are suicide. Eliminated.\n2. **Grow safely**: UP and RIGHT are options. UP to (0,3) is safe (empty) but no apple. RIGHT to (1,2) is also safe but no apple there either.\n3. **Path to nearest apple**: \n   - The apple at (2,3) is very close - if I go RIGHT to (1,2) now, then next turn I can go RIGHT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3) to eat it. That's 2 moves away.\n   - Apple at (1,7): If I go UP now to (0,3), then I'd need to go RIGHT later, but it's farther (5 up from (0,3) to (0,8) or detour to (1,7)).\n   - (0,8) is 6 moves up, but I'd be moving along the edge - risky long-term if enemy cuts me off.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If I go RIGHT to (1,2): \n  - Puts me closer to (2,3) apple.\n  - Avoids trapping myself on the left edge.\n  - Gives more flexibility for future moves.\n- If I go UP to (0,3):\n  - Keeps me on the edge, which might limit escape routes later.\n  - Not progress toward any apple except (0,8), which is inefficient.\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turn:\n- After RIGHT, head to (2,3) apple. Then consider (1,7) or (3,8) based on enemy movement.\n- If enemy moves toward (2,3), I might need to adjust.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is the best move. It positions me toward the dense apple cluster (2,3 and 1,7) while avoiding immediate danger. UP is safe but less strategic.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>",

Only walls, enemy snakes, or myself if I grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,2), my head would be at (0,2) and body at (0,1). Then I can consider next moves. But for now, UP gives an immediate point.\n\nConsider the other apples:\n- (0,8) is far up, but I could go there after (0,2) by moving up the left edge.\n- (2,3) is nearby, I could go right then up after eating (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,2). It might go for the apple at (2,3) or others. But since it's far, not an issue now.\n\nRisk of moving UP: none. It's an apple, so I grow and don't die. The spot is not occupied by an enemy.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to (0,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn strategy: After eating, head at (0,2), body at (0,1). Then I can move UP to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,2). Apples at (0,8) is far, but (2,3) is closer. I should aim for (2,3) next by going RIGHT then UP. But I'll decide next turn.\n\nFinal decision: UP\n</think>\n\nUP</uncensored_response>",

Death if I go there.\n- **LEFT**: to (-1,2) - outside board (wall), instant death.\n- **RIGHT**: to (1,2) - empty space, safe.\n\nApples I can target:\n- (0,8) is directly above me on the left edge - would require moving up several times.\n- (1,7) is close in terms of Manhattan distance - 1 right then 5 up from (0,2).\n- (2,3) is very close - just 2 right and 1 up from (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Snake #0 at (7,2) has no body, so it's small like me. It could move in any direction. Possible threats:\n  - If it moves left toward (6,2), (5,2), etc., it could eventually conflict, but not immediately.\n  - The apple at (2,3) might attract both of us. But from (7,2) to (2,3) is 5 left and 1 up - it would take at least 5 moves, so no immediate danger.\n  - Since the enemy has no body, collisions only occur if we head to the same spot at the same time. Right now, no risk.\n\nImmediate priorities:\n1. **Avoid death**: DOWN and LEFT are suicide. Eliminated.\n2. **Grow safely**: UP and RIGHT are options. UP to (0,3) is safe (empty) but no apple. RIGHT to (1,2) is also safe but no apple there either.\n3. **Path to nearest apple**: \n   - The apple at (2,3) is very close - if I go RIGHT to (1,2) now, then next turn I can go RIGHT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3) to eat it. That's 2 moves away.\n   - Apple at (1,7): If I go UP now to (0,3), then I'd need to go RIGHT later, but it's farther (5 up from (0,3) to (0,8) or detour to (1,7)).\n   - (0,8) is 6 moves up, but I'd be moving along the edge - risky long-term if enemy cuts me off.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If I go RIGHT to (1,2): \n  - Puts me closer to (2,3) apple.\n  - Avoids trapping myself on the left edge.\n  - Gives more flexibility for future moves.\n- If I go UP to (0,3):\n  - Keeps me on the edge, which might limit escape routes later.\n  - Not progress toward any apple except (0,8), which is inefficient.\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turn:\n- After RIGHT, head to (2,3) apple. Then consider (1,7) or (3,8) based on enemy movement.\n- If enemy moves toward (2,3), I might need to adjust.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is the best move. It positions me toward the dense apple cluster (2,3 and 1,7) while avoiding immediate danger. UP is safe but less strategic.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>",

I will also only respond once per turn to avoid multiple responses.\n\nAs an AI, my goal is to maximize point collection while avoiding death. The board is 10x10 with coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. My snake (ID:1) has head at (0,1) and no body yet. Apples are at (0,2), (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (2,3). There's one enemy snake (#0) at head (6,2) with no body.\n\nFrom the board state:\n- At (0,1), I can move UP to (0,2) which has an apple. That would grow my snake to have one body segment at (0,1) and head at (0,2). That's a point gain.\n- Alternatively, I could move LEFT, but x=0 is the left edge, so LEFT from (0,1) would be (-1,1) which is a wall and death. Not an option.\n- Moving RIGHT would go to (1,1), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n- Moving DOWN would go to (0,0), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n\nEnemy snake at (6,2) is far away and not an immediate threat since it has no body to collide with yet. But I should start thinking about long-term strategy.\n\nPriorities:\n1. Eat apples to grow and score points. Closest apple is at (0,2) which is directly above me. That's the best immediate move.\n2. Avoid death: Moving LEFT is impossible. Other moves are safe but less rewarding.\n3. With no body, I can't run into myself. Only walls, enemy snakes, or myself if I grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,2), my head would be at (0,2) and body at (0,1). Then I can consider next moves. But for now, UP gives an immediate point.\n\nConsider the other apples:\n- (0,8) is far up, but I could go there after (0,2) by moving up the left edge.\n- (2,3) is nearby, I could go right then up after eating (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,2). It might go for the apple at (2,3) or others. But since it's far, not an issue now.\n\nRisk of moving UP: none. It's an apple, so I grow and don't die. The spot is not occupied by an enemy.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to (0,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn strategy: After eating, head at (0,2), body at (0,1). Then I can move UP to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,2). Apples at (0,8) is far, but (2,3) is closer. I should aim for (2,3) next by going RIGHT then UP.

Death if I go there.\n- **LEFT**: to (-1,2) - outside board (wall), instant death.\n- **RIGHT**: to (1,2) - empty space, safe.\n\nApples I can target:\n- (0,8) is directly above me on the left edge - would require moving up several times.\n- (1,7) is close in terms of Manhattan distance - 1 right then 5 up from (0,2).\n- (2,3) is very close - just 2 right and 1 up from (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Snake #0 at (7,2) has no body, so it's small like me. It could move in any direction. Possible threats:\n  - If it moves left toward (6,2), (5,2), etc., it could eventually conflict, but not immediately.\n  - The apple at (2,3) might attract both of us. But from (7,2) to (2,3) is 5 left and 1 up - it would take at least 5 moves, so no immediate danger.\n  - Since the enemy has no body, collisions only occur if we head to the same spot at the same time. Right now, no risk.\n\nImmediate priorities:\n1. **Avoid death**: DOWN and LEFT are suicide. Eliminated.\n2. **Grow safely**: UP and RIGHT are options. UP to (0,3) is safe (empty) but no apple. RIGHT to (1,2) is also safe but no apple there either.\n3. **Path to nearest apple**: \n   - The apple at (2,3) is very close - if I go RIGHT to (1,2) now, then next turn I can go RIGHT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3) to eat it. That's 2 moves away.\n   - Apple at (1,7): If I go UP now to (0,3), then I'd need to go RIGHT later, but it's farther (5 up from (0,3) to (0,8) or detour to (1,7)).\n   - (0,8) is 6 moves up, but I'd be moving along the edge - risky long-term if enemy cuts me off.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If I go RIGHT to (1,2): \n  - Puts me closer to (2,3) apple.\n  - Avoids trapping myself on the left edge.\n  - Gives more flexibility for future moves.\n- If I go UP to (0,3):\n  - Keeps me on the edge, which might limit escape routes later.\n  - Not progress toward any apple except (0,8), which is inefficient.\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turn:\n- After RIGHT, head to (2,3) apple. Then consider (1,7) or (3,8) based on enemy movement.\n- If enemy moves toward (2,3), I might need to adjust.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is the best move. It positions me toward the dense apple cluster (2,3 and 1,7) while avoiding immediate danger. UP is safe but less strategic.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>",

I can then target (1,7) or (0,8) next.\n- Enemy snake #0 might be targeting (9,5) or other apples, so minimal competition for (2,3).\n- Even if enemy moves toward me, it would take at least 5 moves to reach (2,3) from (7,2) - plenty of time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **UP** is the best move: immediate apple capture, growth, and sets me up for future moves.\n- After eating, my head is at (2,3) and I can move UP to (2,4) or LEFT to (1,3) to target (1,7) apple.\n\nFinal decision: UP\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

A . . . . . . . .   // (1,0) apple\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   // Columns 0-9\n\nLast move: I moved UP to (2,3) from (2,2) - successfully ate the apple at (2,3) which is now gone.\n\nMy current position: Head at (2,3), body segments at (2,2) and (1,2). So my snake has grown to 3 segments.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3):\n- UP: (2,4) - empty, no immediate threat\n- DOWN: (2,2) - my body segment - collision \u2192 death\n- LEFT: (1,3) - empty\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - empty\n\nApples to consider:\n- (1,7) - 4 units north, 1 unit west\n- (0,8) - 5 units north, 2 units west\n- (3,8) - 5 units north, 1 unit east\n- (9,5) - 7 units east, 2 units south\n- (1,0) - 3 units south, 1 unit west\n\nEnemy snake (#0) at (6,2): It has no body, so it's just a head. Possible moves from (6,2):\n- UP: (6,3)\n- DOWN: (6,1)\n- LEFT: (5,2)\n- RIGHT: (7,2)\n\nThe enemy could be heading toward the apple at (9,5) or (1,0). It's not an immediate threat since it's 4 units away horizontally.\n\nMy priorities:\n1. Avoid death: DOWN would kill me immediately by hitting my own body at (2,2). So DOWN is not an option.\n2. Seek apples: The closest apples are (1,7) and (3,8) vertically, and (1,0) below.\n\nConsidering distances:\n- To (1,7): Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (3,8): |2-3| + |3-8| = 1 + 5 = 6\n- To (0,8): |2-0| + |3-8| = 2 + 5 = 7\n- To (9,5): |2-9| + |3-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n- To (1,0): |2-1| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n(1,0) is the closest in Manhattan distance (4), but it's below me. (1,7) is next at distance 5.\n\nHowever, moving toward (1,0) would require going down, but I'm currently at y=3, and apples like (1,7) are upward. Also, moving down might be short-term but less strategic since there are more apples upward.\n\nEnemy threat: Minimal. Enemy is at (6,2), which is far from the apples I'm targeting. It might compete for (9,5) or (1,0), but (1,0) is closer to me.\n\nPossible moves analysis:\n- UP (2,4): \n  - Pro: Moves toward upper apples (1,7), (3,8), (0,8). \n  - Con: Not directly toward (1,0). \n  - Risk: Low. No immediate threats.\n- LEFT (1,3):\n  - Pro: Positions me to go left/down toward (1,0) or up toward (1,7). \n  - Con: Might be inefficient if I want to go up. \n  - Risk: Low. Only risk if enemy comes this way later.\n- RIGHT (3,3):\n  - Pro: Moves toward (3,8) apple. \n  - Con: Not as direct to other apples. \n  - Risk: Low.\n\nSince (1,7) is apple and at (1,7), which is 4 north and 1 west, moving LEFT to (1,3) then UP to (1,4), (1,5), etc. would be a path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,4) then LEFT to (1,4) is equally efficient to reach (1,7).\n\nBut (1,0) is closer. Why not go for (1,0)? \n- To reach (1,0): From (2,3), I could go LEFT to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2) but (1,2) is my tail. \n- After I move, my tail moves: When I move from (2,3), my body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail at (1,2) moves? Wait, no: When I move, the tail moves only if I don't eat an apple.\n\nImportant rule: When I move, if I don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. If I eat an apple, I grow and the tail stays.\n\nCurrently: After last move, I have head at (2,3), body [ (2,2), (1,2) ]. \n\nIf I move without eating an apple, my new head is at new position, body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail (1,2) is removed.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (1,3), that's not an apple, so:\n- New head: (1,3)\n- Body: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]  // (1,2) is gone since tail moves\n\nThen (1,3) is safe since no apple there.\n\nTo reach (1,0):\n- From (2,3): LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 then DOWN to (1,2) \u2192 but (1,2) will be empty after tail moves? \n  - After move to (1,3): body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ], so (1,2) is free.\n- Then DOWN to (1,2): not apple, so tail moves again, head at (1,2), body [ (1,3), (2,3) ]\n- Then DOWN to (1,1): empty\n- Then DOWN to (1,0): apple! Eat it.\n\nThat's 3 moves to eat (1,0).\n\nWhereas to eat (1,7):\n- Path: UP to (2,4) \u2192 UP to (2,5) \u2192 UP to (2,6) \u2192 LEFT to (1,6) \u2192 UP to (1,7) \u2192 5 moves? Or shorter: \n  - LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 UP to (1,4) \u2192 UP to (1,5) \u2192 UP to (1,6) \u2192 UP to (1,7) \u2192 5 moves.\n\nBut (1,0) is closer in distance but requires moving down, away from other apples.\n\nStrategic view: Board has apples at (1,7), (3,8), (0,8) in the top rows. If I go down to (1,0), I might miss opportunities for multiple apples upward.\n\nEnemy snake at (6,2) might go for (1,0) as well since it's close: |6-1| + |2-0| = 5 + 2 = 7, but that's farther than for me.\n\n(1,0) is also close to the bottom. \n\nI should prioritize the cluster of apples at the top: (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) are all between y=7 and y=8.\n\n(9,5) is at the top right, but far.\n\nTherefore, moving upward might be better for long-term points.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (2,4): Safe, moves toward top apples.\n- LEFT (1,3): Safe, positions for leftward movement or down to (1,0).\n- RIGHT (3,3): Safe, moves toward right, but not directly toward any close apple except (3,8) which is far.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, which is better?\n\nWith UP, I go to (2,4) and then I can go LEFT to (1,4) or continue UP.\n\nWith LEFT, I go to (1,3) and then can go UP to (1,4) or DOWN to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is my tail, which will be empty after this move if I don't eat an apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,3), I don't eat apple, so tail moves: body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ], so (1,2) is free. Then I can go DOWN to (1,2) safely next turn.\n\nBut (1,0) is an apple, so going down might be worth it if I can get it before the enemy.\n\nEnemy might head to (1,0) too. It might move DOWN to (6,1) or LEFT to (5,2), etc., but (1,0) is closer to me.\n\nSince (1,0) is only 4 units away and I can eat it in 3 moves (LEFT, DOWN, DOWN or something), let's calculate.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (1,3):\n- Position: (1,3)\n- Body: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]\n- Next move: DOWN to (1,2) - safe, empty, not apple.\n- Then DOWN to (1,1) - safe, empty.\n- Then DOWN to (1,0) - apple! Eat and grow.\n\nSo 3 moves to eat (1,0).\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (2,4), then to (1,0) would be inefficient.\n\nBut eating (1,0) gives me a point, and I grow. Then I can head upward.\n\nHowever, the enemy might also go for (1,0). From (6,2), it can move:\n- LEFT to (5,2)\n- Then LEFT to (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) - but (2,2) is my body? Wait, after I move, my body changes.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (1,3), my body is at (2,3) and (2,2). So (2,2) is occupied by me.\n\nEnemy moving to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), then to (2,2) would collide with me? But (2,2) is my body segment.\n\nEnemy at (6,2): \n- To reach (1,0): Manhattan distance |6-1| + |2-0| = 5+2=7 moves.\n- Path: e.g., LEFT to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) but (2,2) is my body \u2192 collision if it tries to go there.\n\nAfter my move to (1,3), positions:\n- My head: (1,3)\n- My body: (2,3) and (2,2)\n\nSo (2,2) is occupied. Enemy cannot move to (2,2) without dying.\n\nTherefore, enemy might avoid that path. It could go DOWN then LEFT: (6,2) \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 7 moves.\n\nOr UP then LEFT: (6,3), (5,3) etc. to (1,3) but (1,3) is my head \u2192 collision.\n\nSo enemy has a longer path to (1,0) and risks collisions.\n\nI can reach (1,0) in 3 moves, enemy in at least 7. So I can get it first.\n\nBut is it worth it? (1,0) is one apple. Meanwhile, going up I might get multiple.\n\nThere's also apple at (1,7) which is 4 moves away if I go LEFT then UP.\n\nCompare:\n\nOption A: Go LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 then plan to go DOWN to (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) for apple \u2192 then head up.\n\nOption B: Go UP to (2,4) \u2192 then LEFT to (1,4) \u2192 UP to (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) for apple.\n\nBoth take similar moves to get one apple.\n\nBut after eating (1,0), I'm at bottom. Apples at (1,7), (0,8), (3,8), (9,5) are all far. I'd have to move up.\n\nAfter eating (1,7), I'm near (0,8) and (3,8), which are close.\n\n(0,8) and (3,8) are both at y=8, x=0 and x=3.\n\nFrom (1,7), I can go UP to (1,8) then LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8), (3,8).\n\nSo getting (1,7) positions me for two more apples.\n\nGetting (1,0) positions me for nothing else immediately.\n\nTherefore, long-term, going up is better.\n\nMoreover, there is no immediate threat, so I can take a strategic path.\n\nLast move rationale mentioned setting up for (1,7), so continuing that plan.\n\nMy head at (2,3), (1,7) is at (1,7) - so moving LEFT then UP is direct.\n\nBut moving UP then LEFT is also fine.\n\nTo minimize risk: All moves are safe except DOWN.\n\nI should choose based on efficiency.\n\nThe path to (1,7):\n- Via LEFT: (1,3) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (1,7) - 4 moves to eat (since (1,7) is apple, eat at last move)\n- Via UP: (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) via LEFT? From (2,4) to (1,4) is LEFT, then (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) - still 4 moves.\n\nSame number of moves.\n\nBut if I go LEFT now to (1,3), I can still choose to go UP or DOWN next.\n\nSimilarly with UP.\n\nSince (1,3) is empty, and (2,4) is empty, both safe.\n\nBut (1,3) is closer to (1,0) if I change mind.\n\nHowever, I think (1,7) is a better target.\n\nAlso, the enemy might not go for (1,7) since it's far for them.\n\nAnother apple: (3,8) is at (3,8), which from (2,3) might be reached via RIGHT and UP.\n\nBut (1,7) is closer in x-direction? Both are at high y.\n\nI think I should commit to the upper left.\n\nMove LEFT to (1,3) to get closer to x=1.\n\nOr UP to (2,4) to increase y.\n\nSince (1,7) is at x=1, moving LEFT directly reduces x difference.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3): reduces x from 2 to 1, now only y needs to increase by 4.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,4): y increases to 4, x still 2, then need to reduce x to 1.\n\nSo moving LEFT reduces the x-distance immediately.\n\nManhattan: \n- After move LEFT to (1,3): distance to (1,7) = |1-1| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- After move UP to (2,4): distance to (1,7) = |2-1| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSame Manhattan distance.\n\nBut with LEFT, I am aligned at x=1, so I can just go UP multiple times without changing x.\n\nWith UP, I am at (2,4), which is not aligned, so I need to move LEFT then UP.\n\nBut both require 4 moves to reach (1,7).\n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because it gets me to the correct x-column.\n\nMoreover, from (1,3), I can go UP to (1,4), (1,5), etc., and if I see an opportunity, I can go DOWN to (1,2) for (1,0) if enemy not going for it.\n\nBut since I think (1,7) is better, I'll go LEFT.\n\nEnemy at (6,2): it might go for (9,5) or (1,0). (9,5) is closer to it: |6-9| + |2-5| = 3+3=6, while (1,0) is |6-1|+|2-0|=5+2=7, so (9,5) is closer for enemy.\n\n(9,5) is at top right, enemy at (6,2) bottom middle.\n\nSo enemy might go RIGHT and UP.\n\nTherefore, (1,0) is less contested.\n\nBut I still prefer going for the top apples.\n\nFinal decision: Move LEFT to (1,3) to start heading toward (1,7).\n\nThen next move UP to (1,4), etc.\n\nSo move: LEFT\nensored_rationale>\nI am controlling the snake with head at (2,3) and body segments at [(2,2), (1,2)]. Possible moves:\n- UP: (2,4) - empty, safe, moves toward apples at higher y-coordinates like (1,7), (0,8), and (3,8).\n- DOWN: (2,2) - my body segment, collision would cause death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: (1,3) - empty, safe, reduces x-coordinate to align with the x=1 column where apples (1,7) and (0,8) are located.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - empty, safe, but less efficient for reaching nearby apples.\n\nThe closest apples are (1,7) at Manhattan distance 5 and (1,0) at distance 4. However, (1,0) is downward and isolated, while (1,7) is part of a cluster with (0,8) and (3,8) upward, offering better long-term point potential. Moving LEFT to (1,3) positions me to efficiently reach (1,7) in subsequent moves (e.g., UP to (1,4), etc.), with Manhattan distance to (1,7) reducing to 4 after the move. It also keeps the option open to pursue (1,0) if the enemy snake (head at (6,2)) does not threaten it\u2014though the enemy is more likely to target (9,5) or (1,0) but is far away (minimum 7 moves to (1,0)).\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,2) has no body and is not an immediate threat. It will likely move toward (9,5) (distance 6) or (1,0) (distance 7), but collision risks exist if it approaches my body segments.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I move LEFT to (1,3), I will prioritize moving UP toward (1,7) unless (1,0) becomes more viable. I will monitor the enemy's position to avoid collisions.\n\nThus, LEFT is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and strategic positioning.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

I will also only respond once per turn to avoid multiple responses.\n\nAs an AI, my goal is to maximize point collection while avoiding death. The board is 10x10 with coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. My snake (ID:1) has head at (0,1) and no body yet. Apples are at (0,2), (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (2,3). There's one enemy snake (#0) at head (6,2) with no body.\n\nFrom the board state:\n- At (0,1), I can move UP to (0,2) which has an apple. That would grow my snake to have one body segment at (0,1) and head at (0,2). That's a point gain.\n- Alternatively, I could move LEFT, but x=0 is the left edge, so LEFT from (0,1) would be (-1,1) which is a wall and death. Not an option.\n- Moving RIGHT would go to (1,1), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n- Moving DOWN would go to (0,0), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n\nEnemy snake at (6,2) is far away and not an immediate threat since it has no body to collide with yet. But I should start thinking about long-term strategy.\n\nPriorities:\n1. Eat apples to grow and score points. Closest apple is at (0,2) which is directly above me. That's the best immediate move.\n2. Avoid death: Moving LEFT is impossible. Other moves are safe but less rewarding.\n3. With no body, I can't run into myself. Only walls, enemy snakes, or myself if I grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,2), my head would be at (0,2) and body at (0,1). Then I can consider next moves. But for now, UP gives an immediate point.\n\nConsider the other apples:\n- (0,8) is far up, but I could go there after (0,2) by moving up the left edge.\n- (2,3) is nearby, I could go right then up after eating (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,2). It might go for the apple at (2,3) or others. But since it's far, not an issue now.\n\nRisk of moving UP: none. It's an apple, so I grow and don't die. The spot is not occupied by an enemy.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to (0,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn strategy: After eating, head at (0,2), body at (0,1). Then I can move UP to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,2). Apples at (0,8) is far, but (2,3) is closer. I should aim for (2,3) next by going RIGHT then UP.

Death if I go there.\n- **LEFT**: to (-1,2) - outside board (wall), instant death.\n- **RIGHT**: to (1,2) - empty space, safe.\n\nApples I can target:\n- (0,8) is directly above me on the left edge - would require moving up several times.\n- (1,7) is close in terms of Manhattan distance - 1 right then 5 up from (0,2).\n- (2,3) is very close - just 2 right and 1 up from (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Snake #0 at (7,2) has no body, so it's small like me. It could move in any direction. Possible threats:\n  - If it moves left toward (6,2), (5,2), etc., it could eventually conflict, but not immediately.\n  - The apple at (2,3) might attract both of us. But from (7,2) to (2,3) is 5 left and 1 up - it would take at least 5 moves, so no immediate danger.\n  - Since the enemy has no body, collisions only occur if we head to the same spot at the same time. Right now, no risk.\n\nImmediate priorities:\n1. **Avoid death**: DOWN and LEFT are suicide. Eliminated.\n2. **Grow safely**: UP and RIGHT are options. UP to (0,3) is safe (empty) but no apple. RIGHT to (1,2) is also safe but no apple there either.\n3. **Path to nearest apple**: \n   - The apple at (2,3) is very close - if I go RIGHT to (1,2) now, then next turn I can go RIGHT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3) to eat it. That's 2 moves away.\n   - Apple at (1,7): If I go UP now to (0,3), then I'd need to go RIGHT later, but it's farther (5 up from (0,3) to (0,8) or detour to (1,7)).\n   - (0,8) is 6 moves up, but I'd be moving along the edge - risky long-term if enemy cuts me off.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If I go RIGHT to (1,2): \n  - Puts me closer to (2,3) apple.\n  - Avoids trapping myself on the left edge.\n  - Gives more flexibility for future moves.\n- If I go UP to (0,3):\n  - Keeps me on the edge, which might limit escape routes later.\n  - Not progress toward any apple except (0,8), which is inefficient.\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turn:\n- After RIGHT, head to (2,3) apple. Then consider (1,7) or (3,8) based on enemy movement.\n- If enemy moves toward (2,3), I might need to adjust.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is the best move. It positions me toward the dense apple cluster (2,3 and 1,7) while avoiding immediate danger. UP is safe but less strategic.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>",

I can then target (1,7) or (0,8) next.\n- Enemy snake #0 might be targeting (9,5) or other apples, so minimal competition for (2,3).\n- Even if enemy moves toward me, it would take at least 5 moves to reach (2,3) from (7,2) - plenty of time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **UP** is the best move: immediate apple capture, growth, and sets me up for future moves.\n- After eating, my head is at (2,3) and I can move UP to (2,4) or LEFT to (1,3) to target (1,7) apple.\n\nFinal decision: UP\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

So my snake has grown to 3 segments.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3):\n- UP: (2,4) - empty, no immediate threat\n- DOWN: (2,2) - my body segment - collision \u2192 death\n- LEFT: (1,3) - empty\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - empty\n\nApples to consider:\n- (1,7) - 4 units north, 1 unit west\n- (0,8) - 5 units north, 2 units west\n- (3,8) - 5 units north, 1 unit east\n- (9,5) - 7 units east, 2 units south\n- (1,0) - 3 units south, 1 unit west\n\nEnemy snake (#0) at (6,2): It has no body, so it's just a head. Possible moves from (6,2):\n- UP: (6,3)\n- DOWN: (6,1)\n- LEFT: (5,2)\n- RIGHT: (7,2)\n\nThe enemy could be heading toward the apple at (9,5) or (1,0). It's not an immediate threat since it's 4 units away horizontally.\n\nMy priorities:\n1. Avoid death: DOWN would kill me immediately by hitting my own body at (2,2). So DOWN is not an option.\n2. Seek apples: The closest apples are (1,7) and (3,8) vertically, and (1,0) below.\n\nConsidering distances:\n- To (1,7): Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (3,8): |2-3| + |3-8| = 1 + 5 = 6\n- To (0,8): |2-0| + |3-8| = 2 + 5 = 7\n- To (9,5): |2-9| + |3-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n- To (1,0): |2-1| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n(1,0) is the closest in Manhattan distance (4), but it's below me. (1,7) is next at distance 5.\n\nHowever, moving toward (1,0) would require going down, but I'm currently at y=3, and apples like (1,7) are upward. Also, moving down might be short-term but less strategic since there are more apples upward.\n\nEnemy threat: Minimal. Enemy is at (6,2), which is far from the apples I'm targeting. It might compete for (9,5) or (1,0), but (1,0) is closer to me.\n\nPossible moves analysis:\n- UP (2,4): \n  - Pro: Moves toward upper apples (1,7), (3,8), (0,8). \n  - Con: Not directly toward (1,0). \n  - Risk: Low. No immediate threats.\n- LEFT (1,3):\n  - Pro: Positions me to go left/down toward (1,0) or up toward (1,7). \n  - Con: Might be inefficient if I want to go up. \n  - Risk: Low. Only risk if enemy comes this way later.\n- RIGHT (3,3):\n  - Pro: Moves toward (3,8) apple. \n  - Con: Not as direct to other apples. \n  - Risk: Low.\n\nSince (1,7) is apple and at (1,7), which is 4 north and 1 west, moving LEFT to (1,3) then UP to (1,4), (1,5), etc. would be a path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,4) then LEFT to (1,4) is equally efficient to reach (1,7).\n\nBut (1,0) is closer. Why not go for (1,0)? \n- To reach (1,0): From (2,3), I could go LEFT to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2) but (1,2) is my tail. \n- After I move, my tail moves: When I move from (2,3), my body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail at (1,2) moves? Wait, no: When I move, the tail moves only if I don't eat an apple.\n\nImportant rule: When I move, if I don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. If I eat an apple, I grow and the tail stays.\n\nCurrently: After last move, I have head at (2,3), body [ (2,2), (1,2) ]. \n\nIf I move without eating an apple, my new head is at new position, body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail (1,2) is removed.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (1,3), that's not an apple, so:\n- New head: (1,3)\n- Body: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]  // (1,2) is gone since tail moves\n\nThen (1,3) is safe since no apple there.\n\nTo reach (1,0):\n- From (2,3): LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 then DOWN to (1,2) \u2192 but (1,2) will be empty after tail moves? \n  - After move to (1,3): body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ], so (1,2) is free.\n- Then DOWN to (1,2): not apple, so tail moves again, head at (1,2), body [ (1,3), (2,3) ]\n- Then DOWN to (1,1): empty\n- Then DOWN to (1,0): apple! Eat it.\n\nThat's 3 moves to eat (1,0).\n\nWhereas to eat (1,7):\n- Path: UP to (2,4) \u2192 UP to (2,5) \u2192 UP to (2,6) \u2192 LEFT to (1,6) \u2192 UP to (1,7) \u2192 5 moves? Or shorter: \n  - LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 UP to (1,4) \u2192 UP to (1,5) \u2192 UP to (1,6) \u2192 UP to (1,7) \u2192 5 moves.\n\nBut (1,0) is closer in distance but requires moving down, away from other apples.\n\nStrategic view: Board has apples at (1,7), (3,8), (0,8) in the top rows. If I go down to (1,0), I might miss opportunities for multiple apples upward.\n\nEnemy snake at (6,2) might go for (1,0) as well since it's close: |6-1| + |2-0| = 5 + 2 = 7, but that's farther than for me.\n\n(1,0) is also close to the bottom. \n\nI should prioritize the cluster of apples at the top: (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) are all between y=7 and y=8.\n\n(9,5) is at the top right, but far.\n\nTherefore, moving upward might be better for long-term points.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (2,4): Safe, moves toward top apples.\n- LEFT (1,3): Safe, positions for leftward movement or down to (1,0).\n- RIGHT (3,3): Safe, moves toward right, but not directly toward any close apple except (3,8) which is far.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, which is better?\n\nWith UP, I go to (2,4) and then I can go LEFT to (1,4) or continue UP.\n\nWith LEFT, I go to (1,3) and then can go UP to (1,4) or DOWN to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is my tail, which will be empty after this move if I don't eat an apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,3), I don't eat apple, so tail moves: body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ], so (1,2) is free. Then I can go DOWN to (1,2) safely next turn.\n\nBut (1,0) is an apple, so going down might be worth it if I can get it before the enemy.\n\nEnemy might head to (1,0) too. It might move DOWN to (6,1) or LEFT to (5,2), etc., but (1,0) is closer to me.\n\nSince (1,0) is only 4 units away and I can eat it in 3 moves (LEFT, DOWN, DOWN or something), let's calculate.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (1,3):\n- Position: (1,3)\n- Body: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]\n- Next move: DOWN to (1,2) - safe, empty, not apple.\n- Then DOWN to (1,1) - safe, empty.\n- Then DOWN to (1,0) - apple! Eat and grow.\n\nSo 3 moves to eat (1,0).\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (2,4), then to (1,0) would be inefficient.\n\nBut eating (1,0) gives me a point, and I grow. Then I can head upward.\n\nHowever, the enemy might also go for (1,0). From (6,2), it can move:\n- LEFT to (5,2)\n- Then LEFT to (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) - but (2,2) is my body? Wait, after I move, my body changes.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (1,3), my body is at (2,3) and (2,2). So (2,2) is occupied by me.\n\nEnemy moving to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), then to (2,2) would collide with me? But (2,2) is my body segment.\n\nEnemy at (6,2): \n- To reach (1,0): Manhattan distance |6-1| + |2-0| = 5+2=7 moves.\n- Path: e.g., LEFT to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) but (2,2) is my body \u2192 collision if it tries to go there.\n\nAfter my move to (1,3), positions:\n- My head: (1,3)\n- My body: (2,3) and (2,2)\n\nSo (2,2) is occupied. Enemy cannot move to (2,2) without dying.\n\nTherefore, enemy might avoid that path. It could go DOWN then LEFT: (6,2) \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 7 moves.\n\nOr UP then LEFT: (6,3), (5,3) etc. to (1,3) but (1,3) is my head \u2192 collision.\n\nSo enemy has a longer path to (1,0) and risks collisions.\n\nI can reach (1,0) in 3 moves, enemy in at least 7. So I can get it first.\n\nBut is it worth it? (1,0) is one apple. Meanwhile, going up I might get multiple.\n\nThere's also apple at (1,7) which is 4 moves away if I go LEFT then UP.\n\nCompare:\n\nOption A: Go LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 then plan to go DOWN to (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) for apple \u2192 then head up.\n\nOption B: Go UP to (2,4) \u2192 then LEFT to (1,4) \u2192 UP to (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) for apple.\n\nBoth take similar moves to get one apple.\n\nBut after eating (1,0), I'm at bottom. Apples at (1,7), (0,8), (3,8), (9,5) are all far. I'd have to move up.\n\nAfter eating (1,7), I'm near (0,8) and (3,8), which are close.\n\n(0,8) and (3,8) are both at y=8, x=0 and x=3.\n\nFrom (1,7), I can go UP to (1,8) then LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8), (3,8).\n\nSo getting (1,7) positions me for two more apples.\n\nGetting (1,0) positions me for nothing else immediately.\n\nTherefore, long-term, going up is better.\n\nMoreover, there is no immediate threat, so I can take a strategic path.\n\nLast move rationale mentioned setting up for (1,7), so continuing that plan.\n\nMy head at (2,3), (1,7) is at (1,7) - so moving LEFT then UP is direct.\n\nBut moving UP then LEFT is also fine.\n\nTo minimize risk: All moves are safe except DOWN.\n\nI should choose based on efficiency.\n\nThe path to (1,7):\n- Via LEFT: (1,3) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (1,7) - 4 moves to eat (since (1,7) is apple, eat at last move)\n- Via UP: (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) via LEFT? From (2,4) to (1,4) is LEFT, then (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) - still 4 moves.\n\nSame number of moves.\n\nBut if I go LEFT now to (1,3), I can still choose to go UP or DOWN next.\n\nSimilarly with UP.\n\nSince (1,3) is empty, and (2,4) is empty, both safe.\n\nBut (1,3) is closer to (1,0) if I change mind.\n\nHowever, I think (1,7) is a better target.\n\nAlso, the enemy might not go for (1,7) since it's far for them.\n\nAnother apple: (3,8) is at (3,8), which from (2,3) might be reached via RIGHT and UP.\n\nBut (1,7) is closer in x-direction? Both are at high y.\n\nI think I should commit to the upper left.\n\nMove LEFT to (1,3) to get closer to x=1.\n\nOr UP to (2,4) to increase y.\n\nSince (1,7) is at x=1, moving LEFT directly reduces x difference.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3): reduces x from 2 to 1, now only y needs to increase by 4.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,4): y increases to 4, x still 2, then need to reduce x to 1.\n\nSo moving LEFT reduces the x-distance immediately.\n\nManhattan: \n- After move LEFT to (1,3): distance to (1,7) = |1-1| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- After move UP to (2,4): distance to (1,7) = |2-1| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSame Manhattan distance.\n\nBut with LEFT, I am aligned at x=1, so I can just go UP multiple times without changing x.\n\nWith UP, I am at (2,4), which is not aligned, so I need to move LEFT then UP.\n\nBut both require 4 moves to reach (1,7).\n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because it gets me to the correct x-column.\n\nMoreover, from (1,3), I can go UP to (1,4), (1,5), etc., and if I see an opportunity, I can go DOWN to (1,2) for (1,0) if enemy not going for it.\n\nBut since I think (1,7) is better, I'll go LEFT.\n\nEnemy at (6,2): it might go for (9,5) or (1,0). (9,5) is closer to it: |6-9| + |2-5| = 3+3=6, while (1,0) is |6-1|+|2-0|=5+2=7, so (9,5) is closer for enemy.\n\n(9,5) is at top right, enemy at (6,2) bottom middle.\n\nSo enemy might go RIGHT and UP.\n\nTherefore, (1,0) is less contested.\n\nBut I still prefer going for the top apples.\n\nFinal decision: Move LEFT to (1,3) to start heading toward (1,7).\n\nThen next move UP to (1,4), etc.\n\nSo move: LEFT\nensored_rationale>\nI am controlling the snake with head at (2,3) and body segments at [(2,2), (1,2)]. Possible moves:\n- UP: (2,4) - empty, safe, moves toward apples at higher y-coordinates like (1,7), (0,8), and (3,8).\n- DOWN: (2,2) - my body segment, collision would cause death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: (1,3) - empty, safe, reduces x-coordinate to align with the x=1 column where apples (1,7) and (0,8) are located.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - empty, safe, but less efficient for reaching nearby apples.\n\nThe closest apples are (1,7) at Manhattan distance 5 and (1,0) at distance 4. However, (1,0) is downward and isolated, while (1,7) is part of a cluster with (0,8) and (3,8) upward, offering better long-term point potential. Moving LEFT to (1,3) positions me to efficiently reach (1,7) in subsequent moves (e.g., UP to (1,4), etc.), with Manhattan distance to (1,7) reducing to 4 after the move. It also keeps the option open to pursue (1,0) if the enemy snake (head at (6,2)) does not threaten it\u2014though the enemy is more likely to target (9,5) or (1,0) but is far away (minimum 7 moves to (1,0)).\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,2) has no body and is not an immediate threat. It will likely move toward (9,5) (distance 6) or (1,0) (distance 7), but collision risks exist if it approaches my body segments.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I move LEFT to (1,3), I will prioritize moving UP toward (1,7) unless (1,0) becomes more viable. I will monitor the enemy's position to avoid collisions.\n\nThus, LEFT is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and strategic positioning.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

Since this position is currently occupied, it's an instant death move. Must avoid.\n- RIGHT to (2,3): This is my neck segment, so collision with myself. Also fatal. Must avoid.\n- UP to (1,4): Empty space. Moves me closer to apple cluster at top (1,7), (0,8), (3,8).\n- LEFT to (0,3): Empty space. Moves me toward the left-side apples (0,8) and (1,7).\n\nConsidering apple positions:\n- (1,7) is directly above me at Manhattan distance 4 (1 difference in x, 4 in y)\n- (0,8) is northwest at distance 5\n- (3,8) is northeast at distance 5\n- (1,0) is directly below at distance 3\n- (9,5) is far east at distance 8\n\nEnemy snake at (6,1) poses minimal immediate threat since it's 5 units away horizontally. Its possible moves are UP to (6,2), DOWN to (6,0), LEFT to (5,1), or RIGHT to (7,1). None threaten my position directly.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- (1,0) is the closest apple but moving down would require going through my current tail position at (1,2). However, after I move away from (1,3), the tail will move and free up (1,2) next turn. \n- The top apple cluster (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) offers better long-term point potential since they're grouped.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,3) gets me into the x=0 column, perfectly aligned with (0,8) and allowing easy access to (1,7) via future UP moves.\n- Moving UP to (1,4) increases my y-position but keeps me at x=1, which is also good for reaching (1,7).\n\nAfter evaluating, moving LEFT to (0,3) seems optimal because:\n1) It's safe with no collision risk\n2) It positions me at the western edge (x=0), giving access to both (0,8) and (1,7) with minimal future moves\n3) It maintains flexibility - I could go down toward (1,0) next turn if desired, since (1,2) will be free after tail movement\n4) The enemy snake is far away and likely targeting (9,5) or (1,0) instead of the top cluster\n\nNext turn strategy note for myself: After moving LEFT, check if (1,0) is still available and enemy position. Otherwise continue upward toward the apple cluster.\n\n<uncensored_rationale>\nI am controlling the snake with head at (1,3) and body segments at [(2,3), (2,2)]. Possible moves:\n- UP: (1,4) - empty and safe, moves toward apples at higher y-coordinates like (1,7), (0,8), and (3,8).\n- DOWN: (1,2) - occupied by my body segment (tail), collision would cause death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: (0,3) - empty and safe, positions me at x=0 aligned with apple (0,8) and providing efficient access to (1,7).\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - occupied by my neck segment, collision would cause death. Not an option.\n\n(1,0) is the closest apple (distance 3) but requires moving downward after this turn. The top apple cluster (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) offers better long-term potential. Moving LEFT to (0,3) reduces x-distance to these targets and establishes optimal positioning. Manhattan distance to (0,8) becomes 5 and to (1,7) becomes 4 after the move.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,1) poses no immediate threat (minimum 5 moves away). It will likely move toward (9,5) or (1,0) but both are distant from my planned path.\n\nThus, LEFT is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and board positioning.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

I will also only respond once per turn to avoid multiple responses.\n\nAs an AI, my goal is to maximize point collection while avoiding death. The board is 10x10 with coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. My snake (ID:1) has head at (0,1) and no body yet. Apples are at (0,2), (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (2,3). There's one enemy snake (#0) at head (6,2) with no body.\n\nFrom the board state:\n- At (0,1), I can move UP to (0,2) which has an apple. That would grow my snake to have one body segment at (0,1) and head at (0,2). That's a point gain.\n- Alternatively, I could move LEFT, but x=0 is the left edge, so LEFT from (0,1) would be (-1,1) which is a wall and death. Not an option.\n- Moving RIGHT would go to (1,1), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n- Moving DOWN would go to (0,0), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n\nEnemy snake at (6,2) is far away and not an immediate threat since it has no body to collide with yet. But I should start thinking about long-term strategy.\n\nPriorities:\n1. Eat apples to grow and score points. Closest apple is at (0,2) which is directly above me. That's the best immediate move.\n2. Avoid death: Moving LEFT is impossible. Other moves are safe but less rewarding.\n3. With no body, I can't run into myself. Only walls, enemy snakes, or myself if I grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,2), my head would be at (0,2) and body at (0,1). Then I can consider next moves. But for now, UP gives an immediate point.\n\nConsider the other apples:\n- (0,8) is far up, but I could go there after (0,2) by moving up the left edge.\n- (2,3) is nearby, I could go right then up after eating (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,2). It might go for the apple at (2,3) or others. But since it's far, not an issue now.\n\nRisk of moving UP: none. It's an apple, so I grow and don't die. The spot is not occupied by an enemy.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to (0,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn strategy: After eating, head at (0,2), body at (0,1). Then I can move UP to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,2). Apples at (0,8) is far, but (2,3) is closer. I should aim for (2,3) next by going RIGHT then UP.

It could move in any direction. Possible threats:\n  - If it moves left toward (6,2), (5,2), etc., it could eventually conflict, but not immediately.\n  - The apple at (2,3) might attract both of us. But from (7,2) to (2,3) is 5 left and 1 up - it would take at least 5 moves, so no immediate danger.\n  - Since the enemy has no body, collisions only occur if we head to the same spot at the same time.

It could move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n  - If it moves LEFT, it comes toward me: (6,2) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 ... but still 5 moves away from my position.\n  - The enemy might target the (9,5) apple which is closer to it.\n\n**Immediate opportunity:**\n- Moving UP to (2,3) would let me eat the apple.

Less efficient since (2,3) is right there.\n- DOWN to (2,1): Moves away from all apples - very inefficient.\n- LEFT is suicide - not an option.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Eating the apple at (2,3) makes me longer (3 segments) and stronger.

So my snake has grown to 3 segments.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3):\n- UP: (2,4) - empty, no immediate threat\n- DOWN: (2,2) - my body segment - collision \u2192 death\n- LEFT: (1,3) - empty\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - empty\n\nApples to consider:\n- (1,7) - 4 units north, 1 unit west\n- (0,8) - 5 units north, 2 units west\n- (3,8) - 5 units north, 1 unit east\n- (9,5) - 7 units east, 2 units south\n- (1,0) - 3 units south, 1 unit west\n\nEnemy snake (#0) at (6,2): It has no body, so it's just a head. Possible moves from (6,2):\n- UP: (6,3)\n- DOWN: (6,1)\n- LEFT: (5,2)\n- RIGHT: (7,2)\n\nThe enemy could be heading toward the apple at (9,5) or (1,0). It's not an immediate threat since it's 4 units away horizontally.\n\nMy priorities:\n1. Avoid death: DOWN would kill me immediately by hitting my own body at (2,2). So DOWN is not an option.\n2. Seek apples: The closest apples are (1,7) and (3,8) vertically, and (1,0) below.\n\nConsidering distances:\n- To (1,7): Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (3,8): |2-3| + |3-8| = 1 + 5 = 6\n- To (0,8): |2-0| + |3-8| = 2 + 5 = 7\n- To (9,5): |2-9| + |3-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n- To (1,0): |2-1| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n(1,0) is the closest in Manhattan distance (4), but it's below me. (1,7) is next at distance 5.\n\nHowever, moving toward (1,0) would require going down, but I'm currently at y=3, and apples like (1,7) are upward. Also, moving down might be short-term but less strategic since there are more apples upward.\n\nEnemy threat: Minimal. Enemy is at (6,2), which is far from the apples I'm targeting. It might compete for (9,5) or (1,0), but (1,0) is closer to me.\n\nPossible moves analysis:\n- UP (2,4): \n  - Pro: Moves toward upper apples (1,7), (3,8), (0,8). \n  - Con: Not directly toward (1,0). \n  - Risk: Low. No immediate threats.\n- LEFT (1,3):\n  - Pro: Positions me to go left/down toward (1,0) or up toward (1,7). \n  - Con: Might be inefficient if I want to go up. \n  - Risk: Low. Only risk if enemy comes this way later.\n- RIGHT (3,3):\n  - Pro: Moves toward (3,8) apple. \n  - Con: Not as direct to other apples. \n  - Risk: Low.\n\nSince (1,7) is apple and at (1,7), which is 4 north and 1 west, moving LEFT to (1,3) then UP to (1,4), (1,5), etc. would be a path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,4) then LEFT to (1,4) is equally efficient to reach (1,7).\n\nBut (1,0) is closer. Why not go for (1,0)? \n- To reach (1,0): From (2,3), I could go LEFT to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2) but (1,2) is my tail. \n- After I move, my tail moves: When I move from (2,3), my body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail at (1,2) moves? Wait, no: When I move, the tail moves only if I don't eat an apple.\n\nImportant rule: When I move, if I don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. If I eat an apple, I grow and the tail stays.\n\nCurrently: After last move, I have head at (2,3), body [ (2,2), (1,2) ]. \n\nIf I move without eating an apple, my new head is at new position, body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail (1,2) is removed.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (1,3), that's not an apple, so:\n- New head: (1,3)\n- Body: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]  // (1,2) is gone since tail moves\n\nThen (1,3) is safe since no apple there.\n\nTo reach (1,0):\n- From (2,3): LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 then DOWN to (1,2) \u2192 but (1,2) will be empty after tail moves? \n  - After move to (1,3): body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ], so (1,2) is free.\n- Then DOWN to (1,2): not apple, so tail moves again, head at (1,2), body [ (1,3), (2,3) ]\n- Then DOWN to (1,1): empty\n- Then DOWN to (1,0): apple! Eat it.\n\nThat's 3 moves to eat (1,0).\n\nWhereas to eat (1,7):\n- Path: UP to (2,4) \u2192 UP to (2,5) \u2192 UP to (2,6) \u2192 LEFT to (1,6) \u2192 UP to (1,7) \u2192 5 moves? Or shorter: \n  - LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 UP to (1,4) \u2192 UP to (1,5) \u2192 UP to (1,6) \u2192 UP to (1,7) \u2192 5 moves.\n\nBut (1,0) is closer in distance but requires moving down, away from other apples.\n\nStrategic view: Board has apples at (1,7), (3,8), (0,8) in the top rows. If I go down to (1,0), I might miss opportunities for multiple apples upward.\n\nEnemy snake at (6,2) might go for (1,0) as well since it's close: |6-1| + |2-0| = 5 + 2 = 7, but that's farther than for me.\n\n(1,0) is also close to the bottom. \n\nI should prioritize the cluster of apples at the top: (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) are all between y=7 and y=8.\n\n(9,5) is at the top right, but far.\n\nTherefore, moving upward might be better for long-term points.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (2,4): Safe, moves toward top apples.\n- LEFT (1,3): Safe, positions for leftward movement or down to (1,0).\n- RIGHT (3,3): Safe, moves toward right, but not directly toward any close apple except (3,8) which is far.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, which is better?\n\nWith UP, I go to (2,4) and then I can go LEFT to (1,4) or continue UP.\n\nWith LEFT, I go to (1,3) and then can go UP to (1,4) or DOWN to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is my tail, which will be empty after this move if I don't eat an apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,3), I don't eat apple, so tail moves: body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ], so (1,2) is free. Then I can go DOWN to (1,2) safely next turn.\n\nBut (1,0) is an apple, so going down might be worth it if I can get it before the enemy.\n\nEnemy might head to (1,0) too. It might move DOWN to (6,1) or LEFT to (5,2), etc., but (1,0) is closer to me.\n\nSince (1,0) is only 4 units away and I can eat it in 3 moves (LEFT, DOWN, DOWN or something), let's calculate.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (1,3):\n- Position: (1,3)\n- Body: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]\n- Next move: DOWN to (1,2) - safe, empty, not apple.\n- Then DOWN to (1,1) - safe, empty.\n- Then DOWN to (1,0) - apple! Eat and grow.\n\nSo 3 moves to eat (1,0).\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (2,4), then to (1,0) would be inefficient.\n\nBut eating (1,0) gives me a point, and I grow. Then I can head upward.\n\nHowever, the enemy might also go for (1,0). From (6,2), it can move:\n- LEFT to (5,2)\n- Then LEFT to (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) - but (2,2) is my body? Wait, after I move, my body changes.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (1,3), my body is at (2,3) and (2,2). So (2,2) is occupied by me.\n\nEnemy moving to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), then to (2,2) would collide with me? But (2,2) is my body segment.\n\nEnemy at (6,2): \n- To reach (1,0): Manhattan distance |6-1| + |2-0| = 5+2=7 moves.\n- Path: e.g., LEFT to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) but (2,2) is my body \u2192 collision if it tries to go there.\n\nAfter my move to (1,3), positions:\n- My head: (1,3)\n- My body: (2,3) and (2,2)\n\nSo (2,2) is occupied. Enemy cannot move to (2,2) without dying.\n\nTherefore, enemy might avoid that path. It could go DOWN then LEFT: (6,2) \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 7 moves.\n\nOr UP then LEFT: (6,3), (5,3) etc. to (1,3) but (1,3) is my head \u2192 collision.\n\nSo enemy has a longer path to (1,0) and risks collisions.\n\nI can reach (1,0) in 3 moves, enemy in at least 7. So I can get it first.\n\nBut is it worth it? (1,0) is one apple. Meanwhile, going up I might get multiple.\n\nThere's also apple at (1,7) which is 4 moves away if I go LEFT then UP.\n\nCompare:\n\nOption A: Go LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 then plan to go DOWN to (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) for apple \u2192 then head up.\n\nOption B: Go UP to (2,4) \u2192 then LEFT to (1,4) \u2192 UP to (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) for apple.\n\nBoth take similar moves to get one apple.\n\nBut after eating (1,0), I'm at bottom. Apples at (1,7), (0,8), (3,8), (9,5) are all far. I'd have to move up.\n\nAfter eating (1,7), I'm near (0,8) and (3,8), which are close.\n\n(0,8) and (3,8) are both at y=8, x=0 and x=3.\n\nFrom (1,7), I can go UP to (1,8) then LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8), (3,8).\n\nSo getting (1,7) positions me for two more apples.\n\nGetting (1,0) positions me for nothing else immediately.\n\nTherefore, long-term, going up is better.\n\nMoreover, there is no immediate threat, so I can take a strategic path.\n\nLast move rationale mentioned setting up for (1,7), so continuing that plan.\n\nMy head at (2,3), (1,7) is at (1,7) - so moving LEFT then UP is direct.\n\nBut moving UP then LEFT is also fine.\n\nTo minimize risk: All moves are safe except DOWN.\n\nI should choose based on efficiency.\n\nThe path to (1,7):\n- Via LEFT: (1,3) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (1,7) - 4 moves to eat (since (1,7) is apple, eat at last move)\n- Via UP: (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) via LEFT? From (2,4) to (1,4) is LEFT, then (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) - still 4 moves.\n\nSame number of moves.\n\nBut if I go LEFT now to (1,3), I can still choose to go UP or DOWN next.\n\nSimilarly with UP.\n\nSince (1,3) is empty, and (2,4) is empty, both safe.\n\nBut (1,3) is closer to (1,0) if I change mind.\n\nHowever, I think (1,7) is a better target.\n\nAlso, the enemy might not go for (1,7) since it's far for them.\n\nAnother apple: (3,8) is at (3,8), which from (2,3) might be reached via RIGHT and UP.\n\nBut (1,7) is closer in x-direction? Both are at high y.\n\nI think I should commit to the upper left.\n\nMove LEFT to (1,3) to get closer to x=1.\n\nOr UP to (2,4) to increase y.\n\nSince (1,7) is at x=1, moving LEFT directly reduces x difference.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3): reduces x from 2 to 1, now only y needs to increase by 4.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,4): y increases to 4, x still 2, then need to reduce x to 1.\n\nSo moving LEFT reduces the x-distance immediately.\n\nManhattan: \n- After move LEFT to (1,3): distance to (1,7) = |1-1| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- After move UP to (2,4): distance to (1,7) = |2-1| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSame Manhattan distance.\n\nBut with LEFT, I am aligned at x=1, so I can just go UP multiple times without changing x.\n\nWith UP, I am at (2,4), which is not aligned, so I need to move LEFT then UP.\n\nBut both require 4 moves to reach (1,7).\n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because it gets me to the correct x-column.\n\nMoreover, from (1,3), I can go UP to (1,4), (1,5), etc., and if I see an opportunity, I can go DOWN to (1,2) for (1,0) if enemy not going for it.\n\nBut since I think (1,7) is better, I'll go LEFT.\n\nEnemy at (6,2): it might go for (9,5) or (1,0). (9,5) is closer to it: |6-9| + |2-5| = 3+3=6, while (1,0) is |6-1|+|2-0|=5+2=7, so (9,5) is closer for enemy.\n\n(9,5) is at top right, enemy at (6,2) bottom middle.\n\nSo enemy might go RIGHT and UP.\n\nTherefore, (1,0) is less contested.\n\nBut I still prefer going for the top apples.\n\nFinal decision: Move LEFT to (1,3) to start heading toward (1,7).\n\nThen next move UP to (1,4), etc.\n\nSo move: LEFT\nensored_rationale>\nI am controlling the snake with head at (2,3) and body segments at [(2,2), (1,2)]. Possible moves:\n- UP: (2,4) - empty, safe, moves toward apples at higher y-coordinates like (1,7), (0,8), and (3,8).\n- DOWN: (2,2) - my body segment, collision would cause death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: (1,3) - empty, safe, reduces x-coordinate to align with the x=1 column where apples (1,7) and (0,8) are located.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - empty, safe, but less efficient for reaching nearby apples.\n\nThe closest apples are (1,7) at Manhattan distance 5 and (1,0) at distance 4. However, (1,0) is downward and isolated, while (1,7) is part of a cluster with (0,8) and (3,8) upward, offering better long-term point potential. Moving LEFT to (1,3) positions me to efficiently reach (1,7) in subsequent moves (e.g., UP to (1,4), etc.), with Manhattan distance to (1,7) reducing to 4 after the move. It also keeps the option open to pursue (1,0) if the enemy snake (head at (6,2)) does not threaten it\u2014though the enemy is more likely to target (9,5) or (1,0) but is far away (minimum 7 moves to (1,0)).\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,2) has no body and is not an immediate threat. It will likely move toward (9,5) (distance 6) or (1,0) (distance 7), but collision risks exist if it approaches my body segments.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I move LEFT to (1,3), I will prioritize moving UP toward (1,7) unless (1,0) becomes more viable. I will monitor the enemy's position to avoid collisions.\n\nThus, LEFT is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and strategic positioning.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

My snake is at head (1,3) with body at (2,3) and (2,2). The apples are at (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (1,7), and (1,0). There's also an enemy snake at head (6,1) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (1,3):\n- UP: (1,4) - currently empty\n- DOWN: (1,2) - currently occupied by my body segment (specifically, my tail)\n- LEFT: (0,3) - currently empty\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - currently occupied by my neck segment\n\nImportant note: After I move, my snake's tail will move forward since I only grow when eating an apple. That means if I don't eat an apple this turn, the tail at (2,2) will disappear and my body will become just [(1,3), (2,3)].\n\nNow evaluating move options:\n- DOWN to (1,2): This would cause me to collide with my own body at (1,2). Since this position is currently occupied, it's an instant death move. Must avoid.\n- RIGHT to (2,3): This is my neck segment, so collision with myself. Also fatal. Must avoid.\n- UP to (1,4): Empty space. Moves me closer to apple cluster at top (1,7), (0,8), (3,8).\n- LEFT to (0,3): Empty space. Moves me toward the left-side apples (0,8) and (1,7).\n\nConsidering apple positions:\n- (1,7) is directly above me at Manhattan distance 4 (1 difference in x, 4 in y)\n- (0,8) is northwest at distance 5\n- (3,8) is northeast at distance 5\n- (1,0) is directly below at distance 3\n- (9,5) is far east at distance 8\n\nEnemy snake at (6,1) poses minimal immediate threat since it's 5 units away horizontally. Its possible moves are UP to (6,2), DOWN to (6,0), LEFT to (5,1), or RIGHT to (7,1). None threaten my position directly.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- (1,0) is the closest apple but moving down would require going through my current tail position at (1,2). However, after I move away from (1,3), the tail will move and free up (1,2) next turn. \n- The top apple cluster (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) offers better long-term point potential since they're grouped.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,3) gets me into the x=0 column, perfectly aligned with (0,8) and allowing easy access to (1,7) via future UP moves.\n- Moving UP to (1,4) increases my y-position but keeps me at x=1, which is also good for reaching (1,7).\n\nAfter evaluating, moving LEFT to (0,3) seems optimal because:\n1) It's safe with no collision risk\n2) It positions me at the western edge (x=0), giving access to both (0,8) and (1,7) with minimal future moves\n3) It maintains flexibility - I could go down toward (1,0) next turn if desired, since (1,2) will be free after tail movement\n4) The enemy snake is far away and likely targeting (9,5) or (1,0) instead of the top cluster\n\nNext turn strategy note for myself: After moving LEFT, check if (1,0) is still available and enemy position. Otherwise continue upward toward the apple cluster.\n\n<uncensored_rationale>\nI am controlling the snake with head at (1,3) and body segments at [(2,3), (2,2)]. Possible moves:\n- UP: (1,4) - empty and safe, moves toward apples at higher y-coordinates like (1,7), (0,8), and (3,8).\n- DOWN: (1,2) - occupied by my body segment (tail), collision would cause death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: (0,3) - empty and safe, positions me at x=0 aligned with apple (0,8) and providing efficient access to (1,7).\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - occupied by my neck segment, collision would cause death. Not an option.\n\n(1,0) is the closest apple (distance 3) but requires moving downward after this turn. The top apple cluster (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) offers better long-term potential. Moving LEFT to (0,3) reduces x-distance to these targets and establishes optimal positioning. Manhattan distance to (0,8) becomes 5 and to (1,7) becomes 4 after the move.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,1) poses no immediate threat (minimum 5 moves away). It will likely move toward (9,5) or (1,0) but both are distant from my planned path.\n\nThus, LEFT is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and board positioning.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

Moves me toward the apple at (1,0).\n\nApple positions:\n- (0,8): Directly above me (distance: 5 vertically)\n- (1,7): Above and to the right (distance: 4 vertically + 1 horizontally)\n- (3,8): Far right-top (distance: 5 horizontally + 5 vertically)\n- (9,5): Far right (distance: 9 horizontally + 2 vertically)\n- (1,0): Below and to the right (distance: 3 vertically down + 1 horizontally)\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (5,1) - possible moves: UP (5,2), DOWN (5,0), LEFT (4,1), RIGHT (6,1). None immediately threaten my position.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- After my move, my tail (currently at (2,3)) will move forward since I didn't eat an apple last turn. So my body will become [(1,3)] only, freeing up (2,3).\n- Moving UP gets me closer to the apple cluster at the top (0,8 and 1,7).\n- Moving DOWN gets me closer to (1,0), which is only 3 moves away vertically (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> RIGHT to (1,0).\n- However, (0,0) is currently empty and safe to move to next turn.\n\nComparing UP vs DOWN:\n- UP: Positions me for longer path to multiple apples (0,8 and 1,7)\n- DOWN: Quicker path to (1,0) with less risk\n- Enemy snake might be heading toward (1,0) since it's at (5,1) - only 4 moves away horizontally and vertically. If it moves efficiently, it could reach (1,0) in 4-5 turns.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If enemy snake moves toward (1,0), it might beat me there if I take 3 turns to reach it.\n- The top apples are safer since enemy is far away and likely won't prioritize them immediately.\n\nFinal decision:\n- UP is better for long-term point potential. The top has multiple apples clustered.\n- DOWN is riskier because (1,0) might be contested, and it only gets me one apple.\n- Moving UP to (0,4) keeps me on the edge, which can be advantageous for avoiding traps.\n\n<uncensored_rationale>\nMy head is at (0,3). Possible moves:\n- UP to (0,4): Safe, empty, moves toward top apples. Manhattan distance to (0,8) becomes 4, to (1,7) becomes 4.\n- DOWN to (0,2): Safe, empty, moves toward (1,0) - distance to (1,0) becomes 2 (after move: go to (0,1) then (0,0) then RIGHT to (1,0)).\n- LEFT: Invalid (x=-1)\n- RIGHT: Fatal (collision with own body at (1,3))\n\n(1,0) is tempting but risky: Enemy snake at (5,1) can reach (1,0) in 4 moves (e.g., LEFT to (4,1), LEFT to (3,1), LEFT to (2,1), LEFT to (1,1), DOWN to (1,0)). I would take 3 moves to reach it. High chance of conflict or losing the apple.\n\nTop apples are safer: Enemy is 8+ moves away from them. Moving UP starts a sustainable path upward. After moving UP, next turn I can go UP to (0,5), then (0,6), etc., or eventually RIGHT to (1,7).\n\nThus, UP is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and safety.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nUP",

There's one enemy snake (#0) at head (6,2) with no body.\n\nFrom the board state:\n- At (0,1), I can move UP to (0,2) which has an apple. That would grow my snake to have one body segment at (0,1) and head at (0,2). That's a point gain.\n- Alternatively, I could move LEFT, but x=0 is the left edge, so LEFT from (0,1) would be (-1,1) which is a wall and death. Not an option.\n- Moving RIGHT would go to (1,1), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n- Moving DOWN would go to (0,0), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n\nEnemy snake at (6,2) is far away and not an immediate threat since it has no body to collide with yet. But I should start thinking about long-term strategy.\n\nPriorities:\n1. Eat apples to grow and score points. Closest apple is at (0,2) which is directly above me. That's the best immediate move.\n2. Avoid death: Moving LEFT is impossible. Other moves are safe but less rewarding.\n3. With no body, I can't run into myself. Only walls, enemy snakes, or myself if I grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,2), my head would be at (0,2) and body at (0,1). Then I can consider next moves. But for now, UP gives an immediate point.\n\nConsider the other apples:\n- (0,8) is far up, but I could go there after (0,2) by moving up the left edge.\n- (2,3) is nearby, I could go right then up after eating (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,2). It might go for the apple at (2,3) or others. But since it's far, not an issue now.\n\nRisk of moving UP: none. It's an apple, so I grow and don't die.

Death if I go there.\n- **LEFT**: to (-1,2) - outside board (wall), instant death.\n- **RIGHT**: to (1,2) - empty space, safe.\n\nApples I can target:\n- (0,8) is directly above me on the left edge - would require moving up several times.\n- (1,7) is close in terms of Manhattan distance - 1 right then 5 up from (0,2).\n- (2,3) is very close - just 2 right and 1 up from (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Snake #0 at (7,2) has no body, so it's small like me. It could move in any direction. Possible threats:\n  - If it moves left toward (6,2), (5,2), etc., it could eventually conflict, but not immediately.\n  - The apple at (2,3) might attract both of us. But from (7,2) to (2,3) is 5 left and 1 up - it would take at least 5 moves, so no immediate danger.\n  - Since the enemy has no body, collisions only occur if we head to the same spot at the same time. Right now, no risk.\n\nImmediate priorities:\n1. **Avoid death**: DOWN and LEFT are suicide. Eliminated.\n2. **Grow safely**: UP and RIGHT are options. UP to (0,3) is safe (empty) but no apple. RIGHT to (1,2) is also safe but no apple there either.\n3. **Path to nearest apple**: \n   - The apple at (2,3) is very close - if I go RIGHT to (1,2) now, then next turn I can go RIGHT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3) to eat it. That's 2 moves away.\n   - Apple at (1,7): If I go UP now to (0,3), then I'd need to go RIGHT later, but it's farther (5 up from (0,3) to (0,8) or detour to (1,7)).\n   - (0,8) is 6 moves up, but I'd be moving along the edge - risky long-term if enemy cuts me off.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If I go RIGHT to (1,2): \n  - Puts me closer to (2,3) apple.\n  - Avoids trapping myself on the left edge.\n  - Gives more flexibility for future moves.\n- If I go UP to (0,3):\n  - Keeps me on the edge, which might limit escape routes later.\n  - Not progress toward any apple except (0,8), which is inefficient.\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turn:\n- After RIGHT, head to (2,3) apple. Then consider (1,7) or (3,8) based on enemy movement.\n- If enemy moves toward (2,3), I might need to adjust.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is the best move. It positions me toward the dense apple cluster (2,3 and 1,7) while avoiding immediate danger. UP is safe but less strategic.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>",

Possible moves from (6,2):\n- UP: (6,3)\n- DOWN: (6,1)\n- LEFT: (5,2)\n- RIGHT: (7,2)\n\nThe enemy could be heading toward the apple at (9,5) or (1,0). It's not an immediate threat since it's 4 units away horizontally.\n\nMy priorities:\n1. Avoid death: DOWN would kill me immediately by hitting my own body at (2,2). So DOWN is not an option.\n2. Seek apples: The closest apples are (1,7) and (3,8) vertically, and (1,0) below.\n\nConsidering distances:\n- To (1,7): Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (3,8): |2-3| + |3-8| = 1 + 5 = 6\n- To (0,8): |2-0| + |3-8| = 2 + 5 = 7\n- To (9,5): |2-9| + |3-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n- To (1,0): |2-1| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n(1,0) is the closest in Manhattan distance (4), but it's below me. (1,7) is next at distance 5.\n\nHowever, moving toward (1,0) would require going down, but I'm currently at y=3, and apples like (1,7) are upward. Also, moving down might be short-term but less strategic since there are more apples upward.\n\nEnemy threat: Minimal. Enemy is at (6,2), which is far from the apples I'm targeting. It might compete for (9,5) or (1,0), but (1,0) is closer to me.\n\nPossible moves analysis:\n- UP (2,4): \n  - Pro: Moves toward upper apples (1,7), (3,8), (0,8). \n  - Con: Not directly toward (1,0). \n  - Risk: Low. No immediate threats.\n- LEFT (1,3):\n  - Pro: Positions me to go left/down toward (1,0) or up toward (1,7). \n  - Con: Might be inefficient if I want to go up. \n  - Risk: Low. Only risk if enemy comes this way later.\n- RIGHT (3,3):\n  - Pro: Moves toward (3,8) apple. \n  - Con: Not as direct to other apples. \n  - Risk: Low.\n\nSince (1,7) is apple and at (1,7), which is 4 north and 1 west, moving LEFT to (1,3) then UP to (1,4), (1,5), etc. would be a path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,4) then LEFT to (1,4) is equally efficient to reach (1,7).\n\nBut (1,0) is closer. Why not go for (1,0)? \n- To reach (1,0): From (2,3), I could go LEFT to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2) but (1,2) is my tail. \n- After I move, my tail moves: When I move from (2,3), my body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail at (1,2) moves? Wait, no: When I move, the tail moves only if I don't eat an apple.\n\nImportant rule: When I move, if I don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. If I eat an apple, I grow and the tail stays.\n\nCurrently: After last move, I have head at (2,3), body [ (2,2), (1,2) ]. \n\nIf I move without eating an apple, my new head is at new position, body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail (1,2) is removed.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (1,3), that's not an apple, so:\n- New head: (1,3)\n- Body: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]  // (1,2) is gone since tail moves\n\nThen (1,3) is safe since no apple there.\n\nTo reach (1,0):\n- From (2,3): LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 then DOWN to (1,2) \u2192 but (1,2) will be empty after tail moves? \n  - After move to (1,3): body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ], so (1,2) is free.\n- Then DOWN to (1,2): not apple, so tail moves again, head at (1,2), body [ (1,3), (2,3) ]\n- Then DOWN to (1,1): empty\n- Then DOWN to (1,0): apple! Eat it.\n\nThat's 3 moves to eat (1,0).\n\nWhereas to eat (1,7):\n- Path: UP to (2,4) \u2192 UP to (2,5) \u2192 UP to (2,6) \u2192 LEFT to (1,6) \u2192 UP to (1,7) \u2192 5 moves? Or shorter: \n  - LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 UP to (1,4) \u2192 UP to (1,5) \u2192 UP to (1,6) \u2192 UP to (1,7) \u2192 5 moves.\n\nBut (1,0) is closer in distance but requires moving down, away from other apples.\n\nStrategic view: Board has apples at (1,7), (3,8), (0,8) in the top rows. If I go down to (1,0), I might miss opportunities for multiple apples upward.\n\nEnemy snake at (6,2) might go for (1,0) as well since it's close: |6-1| + |2-0| = 5 + 2 = 7, but that's farther than for me.\n\n(1,0) is also close to the bottom. \n\nI should prioritize the cluster of apples at the top: (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) are all between y=7 and y=8.\n\n(9,5) is at the top right, but far.\n\nTherefore, moving upward might be better for long-term points.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (2,4): Safe, moves toward top apples.\n- LEFT (1,3): Safe, positions for leftward movement or down to (1,0).\n- RIGHT (3,3): Safe, moves toward right, but not directly toward any close apple except (3,8) which is far.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, which is better?\n\nWith UP, I go to (2,4) and then I can go LEFT to (1,4) or continue UP.\n\nWith LEFT, I go to (1,3) and then can go UP to (1,4) or DOWN to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is my tail, which will be empty after this move if I don't eat an apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,3), I don't eat apple, so tail moves: body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ], so (1,2) is free. Then I can go DOWN to (1,2) safely next turn.\n\nBut (1,0) is an apple, so going down might be worth it if I can get it before the enemy.\n\nEnemy might head to (1,0) too. It might move DOWN to (6,1) or LEFT to (5,2), etc., but (1,0) is closer to me.\n\nSince (1,0) is only 4 units away and I can eat it in 3 moves (LEFT, DOWN, DOWN or something), let's calculate.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (1,3):\n- Position: (1,3)\n- Body: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]\n- Next move: DOWN to (1,2) - safe, empty, not apple.\n- Then DOWN to (1,1) - safe, empty.\n- Then DOWN to (1,0) - apple! Eat and grow.\n\nSo 3 moves to eat (1,0).\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (2,4), then to (1,0) would be inefficient.\n\nBut eating (1,0) gives me a point, and I grow. Then I can head upward.\n\nHowever, the enemy might also go for (1,0). From (6,2), it can move:\n- LEFT to (5,2)\n- Then LEFT to (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) - but (2,2) is my body? Wait, after I move, my body changes.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (1,3), my body is at (2,3) and (2,2). So (2,2) is occupied by me.\n\nEnemy moving to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), then to (2,2) would collide with me? But (2,2) is my body segment.\n\nEnemy at (6,2): \n- To reach (1,0): Manhattan distance |6-1| + |2-0| = 5+2=7 moves.\n- Path: e.g., LEFT to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) but (2,2) is my body \u2192 collision if it tries to go there.\n\nAfter my move to (1,3), positions:\n- My head: (1,3)\n- My body: (2,3) and (2,2)\n\nSo (2,2) is occupied. Enemy cannot move to (2,2) without dying.\n\nTherefore, enemy might avoid that path. It could go DOWN then LEFT: (6,2) \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 7 moves.\n\nOr UP then LEFT: (6,3), (5,3) etc. to (1,3) but (1,3) is my head \u2192 collision.\n\nSo enemy has a longer path to (1,0) and risks collisions.\n\nI can reach (1,0) in 3 moves, enemy in at least 7. So I can get it first.\n\nBut is it worth it? (1,0) is one apple. Meanwhile, going up I might get multiple.\n\nThere's also apple at (1,7) which is 4 moves away if I go LEFT then UP.\n\nCompare:\n\nOption A: Go LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 then plan to go DOWN to (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) for apple \u2192 then head up.\n\nOption B: Go UP to (2,4) \u2192 then LEFT to (1,4) \u2192 UP to (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) for apple.\n\nBoth take similar moves to get one apple.\n\nBut after eating (1,0), I'm at bottom. Apples at (1,7), (0,8), (3,8), (9,5) are all far. I'd have to move up.\n\nAfter eating (1,7), I'm near (0,8) and (3,8), which are close.\n\n(0,8) and (3,8) are both at y=8, x=0 and x=3.\n\nFrom (1,7), I can go UP to (1,8) then LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8), (3,8).\n\nSo getting (1,7) positions me for two more apples.\n\nGetting (1,0) positions me for nothing else immediately.\n\nTherefore, long-term, going up is better.\n\nMoreover, there is no immediate threat, so I can take a strategic path.\n\nLast move rationale mentioned setting up for (1,7), so continuing that plan.\n\nMy head at (2,3), (1,7) is at (1,7) - so moving LEFT then UP is direct.\n\nBut moving UP then LEFT is also fine.\n\nTo minimize risk: All moves are safe except DOWN.\n\nI should choose based on efficiency.\n\nThe path to (1,7):\n- Via LEFT: (1,3) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (1,7) - 4 moves to eat (since (1,7) is apple, eat at last move)\n- Via UP: (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) via LEFT? From (2,4) to (1,4) is LEFT, then (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) - still 4 moves.\n\nSame number of moves.\n\nBut if I go LEFT now to (1,3), I can still choose to go UP or DOWN next.\n\nSimilarly with UP.\n\nSince (1,3) is empty, and (2,4) is empty, both safe.\n\nBut (1,3) is closer to (1,0) if I change mind.\n\nHowever, I think (1,7) is a better target.\n\nAlso, the enemy might not go for (1,7) since it's far for them.\n\nAnother apple: (3,8) is at (3,8), which from (2,3) might be reached via RIGHT and UP.\n\nBut (1,7) is closer in x-direction? Both are at high y.\n\nI think I should commit to the upper left.\n\nMove LEFT to (1,3) to get closer to x=1.\n\nOr UP to (2,4) to increase y.\n\nSince (1,7) is at x=1, moving LEFT directly reduces x difference.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3): reduces x from 2 to 1, now only y needs to increase by 4.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,4): y increases to 4, x still 2, then need to reduce x to 1.\n\nSo moving LEFT reduces the x-distance immediately.\n\nManhattan: \n- After move LEFT to (1,3): distance to (1,7) = |1-1| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- After move UP to (2,4): distance to (1,7) = |2-1| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSame Manhattan distance.\n\nBut with LEFT, I am aligned at x=1, so I can just go UP multiple times without changing x.\n\nWith UP, I am at (2,4), which is not aligned, so I need to move LEFT then UP.\n\nBut both require 4 moves to reach (1,7).\n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because it gets me to the correct x-column.\n\nMoreover, from (1,3), I can go UP to (1,4), (1,5), etc., and if I see an opportunity, I can go DOWN to (1,2) for (1,0) if enemy not going for it.\n\nBut since I think (1,7) is better, I'll go LEFT.\n\nEnemy at (6,2): it might go for (9,5) or (1,0). (9,5) is closer to it: |6-9| + |2-5| = 3+3=6, while (1,0) is |6-1|+|2-0|=5+2=7, so (9,5) is closer for enemy.\n\n(9,5) is at top right, enemy at (6,2) bottom middle.\n\nSo enemy might go RIGHT and UP.\n\nTherefore, (1,0) is less contested.\n\nBut I still prefer going for the top apples.\n\nFinal decision: Move LEFT to (1,3) to start heading toward (1,7).\n\nThen next move UP to (1,4), etc.\n\nSo move: LEFT\nensored_rationale>\nI am controlling the snake with head at (2,3) and body segments at [(2,2), (1,2)]. Possible moves:\n- UP: (2,4) - empty, safe, moves toward apples at higher y-coordinates like (1,7), (0,8), and (3,8).\n- DOWN: (2,2) - my body segment, collision would cause death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: (1,3) - empty, safe, reduces x-coordinate to align with the x=1 column where apples (1,7) and (0,8) are located.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - empty, safe, but less efficient for reaching nearby apples.\n\nThe closest apples are (1,7) at Manhattan distance 5 and (1,0) at distance 4. However, (1,0) is downward and isolated, while (1,7) is part of a cluster with (0,8) and (3,8) upward, offering better long-term point potential. Moving LEFT to (1,3) positions me to efficiently reach (1,7) in subsequent moves (e.g., UP to (1,4), etc.), with Manhattan distance to (1,7) reducing to 4 after the move. It also keeps the option open to pursue (1,0) if the enemy snake (head at (6,2)) does not threaten it\u2014though the enemy is more likely to target (9,5) or (1,0) but is far away (minimum 7 moves to (1,0)).\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,2) has no body and is not an immediate threat. It will likely move toward (9,5) (distance 6) or (1,0) (distance 7), but collision risks exist if it approaches my body segments.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I move LEFT to (1,3), I will prioritize moving UP toward (1,7) unless (1,0) becomes more viable. I will monitor the enemy's position to avoid collisions.\n\nThus, LEFT is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and strategic positioning.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

            "rationale": "<think> I will also include a rationale under <uncensored_rationale> if I need to explain my reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state. My snake is at head (1,3) with body at (2,3) and (2,2). The apples are at (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (1,7), and (1,0). There's also an enemy snake at head (6,1) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (1,3):\n- UP: (1,4) - currently empty\n- DOWN: (1,2) - currently occupied by my body segment (specifically, my tail)\n- LEFT: (0,3) - currently empty\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - currently occupied by my neck segment\n\nImportant note: After I move, my snake's tail will move forward since I only grow when eating an apple. That means if I don't eat an apple this turn, the tail at (2,2) will disappear and my body will become just [(1,3), (2,3)].\n\nNow evaluating move options:\n- DOWN to (1,2): This would cause me to collide with my own body at (1,2). Since this position is currently occupied, it's an instant death move. Must avoid.\n- RIGHT to (2,3): This is my neck segment, so collision with myself. Also fatal. Must avoid.\n- UP to (1,4): Empty space. Moves me closer to apple cluster at top (1,7), (0,8), (3,8).\n- LEFT to (0,3): Empty space. Moves me toward the left-side apples (0,8) and (1,7).\n\nConsidering apple positions:\n- (1,7) is directly above me at Manhattan distance 4 (1 difference in x, 4 in y)\n- (0,8) is northwest at distance 5\n- (3,8) is northeast at distance 5\n- (1,0) is directly below at distance 3\n- (9,5) is far east at distance 8\n\nEnemy snake at (6,1) poses minimal immediate threat since it's 5 units away horizontally. Its possible moves are UP to (6,2), DOWN to (6,0), LEFT to (5,1), or RIGHT to (7,1). None threaten my position directly.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- (1,0) is the closest apple but moving down would require going through my current tail position at (1,2). However, after I move away from (1,3), the tail will move and free up (1,2) next turn. \n- The top apple cluster (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) offers better long-term point potential since they're grouped.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,3) gets me into the x=0 column, perfectly aligned with (0,8) and allowing easy access to (1,7) via future UP moves.\n- Moving UP to (1,4) increases my y-position but keeps me at x=1, which is also good for reaching (1,7).\n\nAfter evaluating, moving LEFT to (0,3) seems optimal because:\n1) It's safe with no collision risk\n2) It positions me at the western edge (x=0), giving access to both (0,8) and (1,7) with minimal future moves\n3) It maintains flexibility - I could go down toward (1,0) next turn if desired, since (1,2) will be free after tail movement\n4) The enemy snake is far away and likely targeting (9,5) or (1,0) instead of the top cluster\n\nNext turn strategy note for myself: After moving LEFT, check if (1,0) is still available and enemy position. Otherwise continue upward toward the apple cluster.\n\n<uncensored_rationale>\nI am controlling the snake with head at (1,3) and body segments at [(2,3), (2,2)]. Possible moves:\n- UP: (1,4) - empty and safe, moves toward apples at higher y-coordinates like (1,7), (0,8), and (3,8).\n- DOWN: (1,2) - occupied by my body segment (tail), collision would cause death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: (0,3) - empty and safe, positions me at x=0 aligned with apple (0,8) and providing efficient access to (1,7).\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - occupied by my neck segment, collision would cause death. Not an option.\n\n(1,0) is the closest apple (distance 3) but requires moving downward after this turn. The top apple cluster (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) offers better long-term potential. Moving LEFT to (0,3) reduces x-distance to these targets and establishes optimal positioning. Manhattan distance to (0,8) becomes 5 and to (1,7) becomes 4 after the move.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,1) poses no immediate threat (minimum 5 moves away). It will likely move toward (9,5) or (1,0) but both are distant from my planned path.\n\nThus, LEFT is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and board positioning.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

            "rationale": "<think> I will also include a rationale under <uncensored_rationale> if I need to explain my reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state. My snake (ID: 1) has its head at (0, 3) and body at [(1, 3), (2, 3)]. The apples are at (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (1,7), and (1,0). There's an enemy snake (#0) with head at (5,1) and no body segments.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (0,3):\n- UP: (0,4) - currently empty\n- DOWN: (0,2) - currently empty\n- LEFT: (-1,3) - out of bounds (invalid, death)\n- RIGHT: (1,3) - currently occupied by my body segment\n\nEvaluating each:\n- LEFT: Invalid, would hit wall at x=-1. Immediate death.\n- RIGHT: (1,3) is my neck segment. Collision with myself. Death.\n- UP: (0,4) - empty space. Moves me toward the top-left apples (0,8) and (1,7).\n- DOWN: (0,2) - empty space. Moves me toward the apple at (1,0).\n\nApple positions:\n- (0,8): Directly above me (distance: 5 vertically)\n- (1,7): Above and to the right (distance: 4 vertically + 1 horizontally)\n- (3,8): Far right-top (distance: 5 horizontally + 5 vertically)\n- (9,5): Far right (distance: 9 horizontally + 2 vertically)\n- (1,0): Below and to the right (distance: 3 vertically down + 1 horizontally)\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (5,1) - possible moves: UP (5,2), DOWN (5,0), LEFT (4,1), RIGHT (6,1). None immediately threaten my position.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- After my move, my tail (currently at (2,3)) will move forward since I didn't eat an apple last turn. So my body will become [(1,3)] only, freeing up (2,3).\n- Moving UP gets me closer to the apple cluster at the top (0,8 and 1,7).\n- Moving DOWN gets me closer to (1,0), which is only 3 moves away vertically (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> RIGHT to (1,0).\n- However, (0,0) is currently empty and safe to move to next turn.\n\nComparing UP vs DOWN:\n- UP: Positions me for longer path to multiple apples (0,8 and 1,7)\n- DOWN: Quicker path to (1,0) with less risk\n- Enemy snake might be heading toward (1,0) since it's at (5,1) - only 4 moves away horizontally and vertically. If it moves efficiently, it could reach (1,0) in 4-5 turns.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If enemy snake moves toward (1,0), it might beat me there if I take 3 turns to reach it.\n- The top apples are safer since enemy is far away and likely won't prioritize them immediately.\n\nFinal decision:\n- UP is better for long-term point potential. The top has multiple apples clustered.\n- DOWN is riskier because (1,0) might be contested, and it only gets me one apple.\n- Moving UP to (0,4) keeps me on the edge, which can be advantageous for avoiding traps.\n\n<uncensored_rationale>\nMy head is at (0,3). Possible moves:\n- UP to (0,4): Safe, empty, moves toward top apples. Manhattan distance to (0,8) becomes 4, to (1,7) becomes 4.\n- DOWN to (0,2): Safe, empty, moves toward (1,0) - distance to (1,0) becomes 2 (after move: go to (0,1) then (0,0) then RIGHT to (1,0)).\n- LEFT: Invalid (x=-1)\n- RIGHT: Fatal (collision with own body at (1,3))\n\n(1,0) is tempting but risky: Enemy snake at (5,1) can reach (1,0) in 4 moves (e.g., LEFT to (4,1), LEFT to (3,1), LEFT to (2,1), LEFT to (1,1), DOWN to (1,0)). I would take 3 moves to reach it. High chance of conflict or losing the apple.\n\nTop apples are safer: Enemy is 8+ moves away from them. Moving UP starts a sustainable path upward. After moving UP, next turn I can go UP to (0,5), then (0,6), etc., or eventually RIGHT to (1,7).\n\nThus, UP is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and safety.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nUP",

            "rationale": "<think> But first, let me assess the current state.\n\nCurrent board state:\n- My snake (ID: 1) head is at (0,4), with body at [(0,3), (1,3)]\n- Enemy snake (#0) head at (5,0) with no body\n- Apples at: (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (1,7), (1,0)\n\nPossible moves from my head at (0,4):\n- UP: (0,5) - board shows empty at y=5, x=0? Wait, let me check the grid:\n\nLooking at the board state:\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . . \nRow 8: A . . A . . . . . .   # apples at (0,8) and (3,8)\nRow 7: . A . . . . . . . .   # apple at (1,7)\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A   # apple at (9,5)\nRow 4: 1 . . . . . . . . .   # my head at (0,4)\nRow 3: T T . . . . . . . .   # my body at (0,3) and (1,3)\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 0: . A . . . 0 . . . .   # apple at (1,0) and enemy head at (5,0)\n\nSo for (0,4):\n- UP: (0,5) - empty (row 5, position x=0 is .)\n- DOWN: (0,3) - occupied by my own body (T for tail)\n- LEFT: (-1,4) - out of bounds (x=-1, invalid)\n- RIGHT: (1,4) - empty (row 4, position x=1 is .)\n\nSo valid moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, assessment:\n- UP to (0,5):\n  - Moves me toward apples at (0,8) and (1,7). Distance to (0,8): 3 up (manhattan). \n  - After moving, my body will shift: head at (0,5), body becomes [(0,4), (0,3)] (since I didn't eat an apple last turn? Wait, last move was UP to (0,4), which was empty, so no growth. Therefore, my tail moves from (1,3) to (0,3) and the neck becomes (0,4). After next move, body will be [(0,4), (0,3)] for a length 3 snake.\n\n- RIGHT to (1,4):\n  - Moves me toward (1,7) apple and also (3,8). Distance to (1,7): 3 up (from y=4 to y=7) and same x=1.\n  - Also gets me away from the left wall.\n\nEnemy snake at (5,0):\n- Possible moves: UP (5,1), DOWN (5,-1 invalid), LEFT (4,0), RIGHT (6,0)\n- Since no body, enemy can move freely. (5,0) is at row 0, so DOWN is invalid. So enemy can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- The apple at (1,0) is nearby, so enemy might move LEFT toward it.\n\nApple priorities:\n- Closest apples to me:\n  - (1,0): distance |0-1| + |4-0| = 1 + 4 = 5\n  - (0,8): |0-0| + |4-8| = 4\n  - (1,7): |0-1| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4\n  - (3,8): |0-3| + |4-8| = 3 + 4 = 7\n  - (9,5): |0-9| + |4-5| = 9 + 1 = 10\n\nSo (0,8) and (1,7) are equally close at manhattan distance 4, while (1,0) is farther at 5.\n\nBut (1,0) is at a low y, near the enemy. Moving toward (1,0) would require me to go down and right, which isn't directly possible from here.\n\nFrom (0,4):\n- To reach (1,0): I need to go DOWN to (0,3) but that's blocked by my body. So not possible directly. I would have to go UP or RIGHT first, then later down.\n\nBut (0,3) is my body, so I cannot go DOWN. Therefore, (1,0) is not immediately accessible.\n\nEnemy at (5,0) might go for (1,0) by moving LEFT multiple times.\n\nFor me, the top apples are more accessible.\n\nMoving UP to (0,5) gets me closer to (0,8) and (1,7). From (0,5), next move could be UP to (0,6) or RIGHT to (1,5) to head toward (1,7).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1,4) also gets me closer to (1,7) and (3,8). From (1,4), I could go UP to (1,5), then (1,6), (1,7) to eat that apple.\n\nComparing UP vs RIGHT:\n- UP: Puts me at (0,5). This keeps me on the left edge. Risk: if I stay on the edge, I have fewer escape routes.\n- RIGHT: Puts me at (1,4). This moves me inward, giving more flexibility.\n\nBut the board has many open spaces.\n\nEnemy threat: enemy is at (5,0) and has no body, so it's small and fast. It might grow if it eats an apple. But right now, it can only threaten apples near it, like (1,0) or perhaps move up.\n\nSince I am at (0,4) and enemy at (5,0), we are 5 units apart horizontally and 4 vertically, so manhattan distance 9. Not an immediate threat.\n\nApples: (0,8) is directly above me. If I go UP, in 3 moves: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8) eat apple. Similarly, (1,7) is at distance 3: from (0,4) go RIGHT to (1,4), then UP to (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) - 3 moves.\n\nBut if I go UP first to (0,5), then to get to (1,7) I need to go RIGHT then UP, which might be less direct.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,4), then I can go UP to (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) in 3 moves.\n\nEither way, I can reach an apple in 3 moves.\n\nBut (0,8) is closer vertically if I go UP.\n\nAlso, after this move, my tail will be at (0,3) and (1,3)? After my last move (UP to (0,4)), my body was [(0,3), (1,3)]. When I move next, since I didn't eat an apple, my tail moves forward. So the tail at (1,3) will be removed, and new positions: head at new position, body [old head, first body segment]. \n\nSo if I move UP to (0,5):\n- Head: (0,5)\n- Body: [(0,4), (0,3)]  // since the segment at (1,3) disappears\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,4):\n- Head: (1,4)\n- Body: [(0,4), (0,3)]  // similarly, tail at (1,3) gone\n\nIn both cases, (1,3) becomes empty.\n\nNow, safety:\n- UP (0,5): empty, safe.\n- RIGHT (1,4): empty, safe.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nLong-term strategy: I want to collect apples efficiently. The cluster at top left has (0,8) and (1,7), which are close.\n\nGoing UP might lead me to (0,8) directly, but then I could be cornered on the top edge.\n\nGoing RIGHT gives me more space to maneuver and access to (1,7) and (3,8).\n\nAlso, the apple at (1,0) is being contested by the enemy. Enemy at (5,0) might move LEFT to (4,0), then (3,0), etc. to get to (1,0). I am not in a position to get it soon, so I should avoid that area for now.\n\nTherefore, I think RIGHT is better because:\n- It positions me centrally.\n- It allows direct path to (1,7) apple.\n- From (1,4), I can choose to go UP or RIGHT next, giving flexibility.\n\nUP is also good, but it keeps me on the left edge, which might be limiting.\n\nLast turn rationale said UP was chosen to go for top apples. Now, moving RIGHT would start moving horizontally toward the cluster.\n\nBut let's see the distances:\n- From (0,4) to (1,7): manhattan |0-1| + |4-7| = 1+3=4\n- If I go UP to (0,5): distance to (1,7) becomes |0-1| + |5-7| =1+2=3\n- If I go RIGHT to (1,4): distance to (1,7) becomes |1-1| + |4-7| =0+3=3\n\nSame reduction in distance.\n\nTo (0,8):\n- From (0,4): |0-0| + |4-8| =4\n- After UP: |0-0| + |5-8| =3\n- After RIGHT: |1-0| + |4-8| =1+4=5\n\nSo UP reduces distance to (0,8), while RIGHT increases it slightly.\n\nBut (1,7) is equally reduced by both moves.\n\nI should consider which apple to target first. (0,8) and (1,7) are both at distance 4 now.\n\n(0,8) is on the edge, (1,7) is one step in. (1,7) might be better to get first because it's not on the very edge.\n\nAlso, after getting (1,7), I could go to (3,8) or others.\n\nEnemy might go for (1,0) or move upward.\n\nSince enemy has no body, it can move fast. I should not worry too much.\n\nBut to maximize points, I should go for the nearest safe path.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe and equally good in terms of distance to some apples.\n\nBut UP might lead to a dead end if I go to (0,8) and then have to come down.\n\nWhereas RIGHT opens up the board.\n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better for flexibility.\n\nLast turn I moved UP, so continuing upward might be consistent.\n\nNo need to be consistent.\n\nI'll choose RIGHT to move toward the center.\n\n<uncensored_rationale>\nMy head is at (0,4). Valid moves: UP and RIGHT.\n- UP to (0,5): Moves toward (0,8) apple, reducing manhattan distance to 3. Keeps me on the left edge, which may limit future moves.\n- RIGHT to (1,4): Moves toward (1,7) apple, reducing manhattan distance to 3. Positions me more centrally for better maneuverability and access to multiple apples (e.g., (1,7), (3,8), and eventually (9,5)).\n\nEnemy snake at (5,0) poses no immediate threat. It may target the (1,0) apple, which is far from my position and not worth competing for at this stage.\n\nMoving RIGHT is preferable as it avoids trapping myself on the edge and provides more options for future moves. The apple at (1,7) is equally reachable from (1,4) as (0,8) is from (0,5), but central positioning reduces risk.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n\nTherefore, my move is RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nRIGHT",

The board is 10x10 with coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. My snake (ID:1) has head at (0,1) and no body yet. Apples are at (0,2), (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (2,3). There's one enemy snake (#0) at head (6,2) with no body.\n\nFrom the board state:\n- At (0,1), I can move UP to (0,2) which has an apple. That would grow my snake to have one body segment at (0,1) and head at (0,2). That's a point gain.\n- Alternatively, I could move LEFT, but x=0 is the left edge, so LEFT from (0,1) would be (-1,1) which is a wall and death. Not an option.\n- Moving RIGHT would go to (1,1), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n- Moving DOWN would go to (0,0), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n\nEnemy snake at (6,2) is far away and not an immediate threat since it has no body to collide with yet. But I should start thinking about long-term strategy.\n\nPriorities:\n1. Eat apples to grow and score points. Closest apple is at (0,2) which is directly above me. That's the best immediate move.\n2. Avoid death: Moving LEFT is impossible. Other moves are safe but less rewarding.\n3. With no body, I can't run into myself. Only walls, enemy snakes, or myself if I grow.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,2), my head would be at (0,2) and body at (0,1). Then I can consider next moves. But for now, UP gives an immediate point.\n\nConsider the other apples:\n- (0,8) is far up, but I could go there after (0,2) by moving up the left edge.\n- (2,3) is nearby, I could go right then up after eating (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,2). It might go for the apple at (2,3) or others. But since it's far, not an issue now.\n\nRisk of moving UP: none. It's an apple, so I grow and don't die. The spot is not occupied by an enemy.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to (0,2) to eat the apple.\n\nFor next turn strategy: After eating, head at (0,2), body at (0,1). Then I can move UP to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,2). Apples at (0,8) is far, but (2,3) is closer. I should aim for (2,3) next by going RIGHT then UP.

Death if I go there.\n- **LEFT**: to (-1,2) - outside board (wall), instant death.\n- **RIGHT**: to (1,2) - empty space, safe.\n\nApples I can target:\n- (0,8) is directly above me on the left edge - would require moving up several times.\n- (1,7) is close in terms of Manhattan distance - 1 right then 5 up from (0,2).\n- (2,3) is very close - just 2 right and 1 up from (0,2).\n- (3,8) and (9,5) are farther.\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Snake #0 at (7,2) has no body, so it's small like me. It could move in any direction. Possible threats:\n  - If it moves left toward (6,2), (5,2), etc., it could eventually conflict, but not immediately.\n  - The apple at (2,3) might attract both of us. But from (7,2) to (2,3) is 5 left and 1 up - it would take at least 5 moves, so no immediate danger.\n  - Since the enemy has no body, collisions only occur if we head to the same spot at the same time. Right now, no risk.\n\nImmediate priorities:\n1. **Avoid death**: DOWN and LEFT are suicide. Eliminated.\n2. **Grow safely**: UP and RIGHT are options. UP to (0,3) is safe (empty) but no apple. RIGHT to (1,2) is also safe but no apple there either.\n3. **Path to nearest apple**: \n   - The apple at (2,3) is very close - if I go RIGHT to (1,2) now, then next turn I can go RIGHT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3) to eat it. That's 2 moves away.\n   - Apple at (1,7): If I go UP now to (0,3), then I'd need to go RIGHT later, but it's farther (5 up from (0,3) to (0,8) or detour to (1,7)).\n   - (0,8) is 6 moves up, but I'd be moving along the edge - risky long-term if enemy cuts me off.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If I go RIGHT to (1,2): \n  - Puts me closer to (2,3) apple.\n  - Avoids trapping myself on the left edge.\n  - Gives more flexibility for future moves.\n- If I go UP to (0,3):\n  - Keeps me on the edge, which might limit escape routes later.\n  - Not progress toward any apple except (0,8), which is inefficient.\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turn:\n- After RIGHT, head to (2,3) apple. Then consider (1,7) or (3,8) based on enemy movement.\n- If enemy moves toward (2,3), I might need to adjust.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is the best move. It positions me toward the dense apple cluster (2,3 and 1,7) while avoiding immediate danger. UP is safe but less strategic.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>",

Possible moves from (6,2):\n- UP: (6,3)\n- DOWN: (6,1)\n- LEFT: (5,2)\n- RIGHT: (7,2)\n\nThe enemy could be heading toward the apple at (9,5) or (1,0). It's not an immediate threat since it's 4 units away horizontally.\n\nMy priorities:\n1. Avoid death: DOWN would kill me immediately by hitting my own body at (2,2). So DOWN is not an option.\n2. Seek apples: The closest apples are (1,7) and (3,8) vertically, and (1,0) below.\n\nConsidering distances:\n- To (1,7): Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (3,8): |2-3| + |3-8| = 1 + 5 = 6\n- To (0,8): |2-0| + |3-8| = 2 + 5 = 7\n- To (9,5): |2-9| + |3-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\n- To (1,0): |2-1| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n(1,0) is the closest in Manhattan distance (4), but it's below me. (1,7) is next at distance 5.\n\nHowever, moving toward (1,0) would require going down, but I'm currently at y=3, and apples like (1,7) are upward. Also, moving down might be short-term but less strategic since there are more apples upward.\n\nEnemy threat: Minimal. Enemy is at (6,2), which is far from the apples I'm targeting. It might compete for (9,5) or (1,0), but (1,0) is closer to me.\n\nPossible moves analysis:\n- UP (2,4): \n  - Pro: Moves toward upper apples (1,7), (3,8), (0,8). \n  - Con: Not directly toward (1,0). \n  - Risk: Low. No immediate threats.\n- LEFT (1,3):\n  - Pro: Positions me to go left/down toward (1,0) or up toward (1,7). \n  - Con: Might be inefficient if I want to go up. \n  - Risk: Low. Only risk if enemy comes this way later.\n- RIGHT (3,3):\n  - Pro: Moves toward (3,8) apple. \n  - Con: Not as direct to other apples. \n  - Risk: Low.\n\nSince (1,7) is apple and at (1,7), which is 4 north and 1 west, moving LEFT to (1,3) then UP to (1,4), (1,5), etc. would be a path.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,4) then LEFT to (1,4) is equally efficient to reach (1,7).\n\nBut (1,0) is closer. Why not go for (1,0)? \n- To reach (1,0): From (2,3), I could go LEFT to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2) but (1,2) is my tail. \n- After I move, my tail moves: When I move from (2,3), my body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail at (1,2) moves? Wait, no: When I move, the tail moves only if I don't eat an apple.\n\nImportant rule: When I move, if I don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward. If I eat an apple, I grow and the tail stays.\n\nCurrently: After last move, I have head at (2,3), body [ (2,2), (1,2) ]. \n\nIf I move without eating an apple, my new head is at new position, body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail (1,2) is removed.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (1,3), that's not an apple, so:\n- New head: (1,3)\n- Body: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]  // (1,2) is gone since tail moves\n\nThen (1,3) is safe since no apple there.\n\nTo reach (1,0):\n- From (2,3): LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 then DOWN to (1,2) \u2192 but (1,2) will be empty after tail moves? \n  - After move to (1,3): body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ], so (1,2) is free.\n- Then DOWN to (1,2): not apple, so tail moves again, head at (1,2), body [ (1,3), (2,3) ]\n- Then DOWN to (1,1): empty\n- Then DOWN to (1,0): apple! Eat it.\n\nThat's 3 moves to eat (1,0).\n\nWhereas to eat (1,7):\n- Path: UP to (2,4) \u2192 UP to (2,5) \u2192 UP to (2,6) \u2192 LEFT to (1,6) \u2192 UP to (1,7) \u2192 5 moves? Or shorter: \n  - LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 UP to (1,4) \u2192 UP to (1,5) \u2192 UP to (1,6) \u2192 UP to (1,7) \u2192 5 moves.\n\nBut (1,0) is closer in distance but requires moving down, away from other apples.\n\nStrategic view: Board has apples at (1,7), (3,8), (0,8) in the top rows. If I go down to (1,0), I might miss opportunities for multiple apples upward.\n\nEnemy snake at (6,2) might go for (1,0) as well since it's close: |6-1| + |2-0| = 5 + 2 = 7, but that's farther than for me.\n\n(1,0) is also close to the bottom. \n\nI should prioritize the cluster of apples at the top: (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) are all between y=7 and y=8.\n\n(9,5) is at the top right, but far.\n\nTherefore, moving upward might be better for long-term points.\n\nMove options:\n- UP (2,4): Safe, moves toward top apples.\n- LEFT (1,3): Safe, positions for leftward movement or down to (1,0).\n- RIGHT (3,3): Safe, moves toward right, but not directly toward any close apple except (3,8) which is far.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, which is better?\n\nWith UP, I go to (2,4) and then I can go LEFT to (1,4) or continue UP.\n\nWith LEFT, I go to (1,3) and then can go UP to (1,4) or DOWN to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is my tail, which will be empty after this move if I don't eat an apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,3), I don't eat apple, so tail moves: body becomes [ (2,3), (2,2) ], so (1,2) is free. Then I can go DOWN to (1,2) safely next turn.\n\nBut (1,0) is an apple, so going down might be worth it if I can get it before the enemy.\n\nEnemy might head to (1,0) too. It might move DOWN to (6,1) or LEFT to (5,2), etc., but (1,0) is closer to me.\n\nSince (1,0) is only 4 units away and I can eat it in 3 moves (LEFT, DOWN, DOWN or something), let's calculate.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (1,3):\n- Position: (1,3)\n- Body: [ (2,3), (2,2) ]\n- Next move: DOWN to (1,2) - safe, empty, not apple.\n- Then DOWN to (1,1) - safe, empty.\n- Then DOWN to (1,0) - apple! Eat and grow.\n\nSo 3 moves to eat (1,0).\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP first to (2,4), then to (1,0) would be inefficient.\n\nBut eating (1,0) gives me a point, and I grow. Then I can head upward.\n\nHowever, the enemy might also go for (1,0). From (6,2), it can move:\n- LEFT to (5,2)\n- Then LEFT to (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) - but (2,2) is my body? Wait, after I move, my body changes.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (1,3), my body is at (2,3) and (2,2). So (2,2) is occupied by me.\n\nEnemy moving to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), then to (2,2) would collide with me? But (2,2) is my body segment.\n\nEnemy at (6,2): \n- To reach (1,0): Manhattan distance |6-1| + |2-0| = 5+2=7 moves.\n- Path: e.g., LEFT to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) but (2,2) is my body \u2192 collision if it tries to go there.\n\nAfter my move to (1,3), positions:\n- My head: (1,3)\n- My body: (2,3) and (2,2)\n\nSo (2,2) is occupied. Enemy cannot move to (2,2) without dying.\n\nTherefore, enemy might avoid that path. It could go DOWN then LEFT: (6,2) \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 7 moves.\n\nOr UP then LEFT: (6,3), (5,3) etc. to (1,3) but (1,3) is my head \u2192 collision.\n\nSo enemy has a longer path to (1,0) and risks collisions.\n\nI can reach (1,0) in 3 moves, enemy in at least 7. So I can get it first.\n\nBut is it worth it? (1,0) is one apple. Meanwhile, going up I might get multiple.\n\nThere's also apple at (1,7) which is 4 moves away if I go LEFT then UP.\n\nCompare:\n\nOption A: Go LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 then plan to go DOWN to (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) for apple \u2192 then head up.\n\nOption B: Go UP to (2,4) \u2192 then LEFT to (1,4) \u2192 UP to (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) for apple.\n\nBoth take similar moves to get one apple.\n\nBut after eating (1,0), I'm at bottom. Apples at (1,7), (0,8), (3,8), (9,5) are all far. I'd have to move up.\n\nAfter eating (1,7), I'm near (0,8) and (3,8), which are close.\n\n(0,8) and (3,8) are both at y=8, x=0 and x=3.\n\nFrom (1,7), I can go UP to (1,8) then LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8), (3,8).\n\nSo getting (1,7) positions me for two more apples.\n\nGetting (1,0) positions me for nothing else immediately.\n\nTherefore, long-term, going up is better.\n\nMoreover, there is no immediate threat, so I can take a strategic path.\n\nLast move rationale mentioned setting up for (1,7), so continuing that plan.\n\nMy head at (2,3), (1,7) is at (1,7) - so moving LEFT then UP is direct.\n\nBut moving UP then LEFT is also fine.\n\nTo minimize risk: All moves are safe except DOWN.\n\nI should choose based on efficiency.\n\nThe path to (1,7):\n- Via LEFT: (1,3) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (1,7) - 4 moves to eat (since (1,7) is apple, eat at last move)\n- Via UP: (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) via LEFT? From (2,4) to (1,4) is LEFT, then (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) - still 4 moves.\n\nSame number of moves.\n\nBut if I go LEFT now to (1,3), I can still choose to go UP or DOWN next.\n\nSimilarly with UP.\n\nSince (1,3) is empty, and (2,4) is empty, both safe.\n\nBut (1,3) is closer to (1,0) if I change mind.\n\nHowever, I think (1,7) is a better target.\n\nAlso, the enemy might not go for (1,7) since it's far for them.\n\nAnother apple: (3,8) is at (3,8), which from (2,3) might be reached via RIGHT and UP.\n\nBut (1,7) is closer in x-direction? Both are at high y.\n\nI think I should commit to the upper left.\n\nMove LEFT to (1,3) to get closer to x=1.\n\nOr UP to (2,4) to increase y.\n\nSince (1,7) is at x=1, moving LEFT directly reduces x difference.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3): reduces x from 2 to 1, now only y needs to increase by 4.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,4): y increases to 4, x still 2, then need to reduce x to 1.\n\nSo moving LEFT reduces the x-distance immediately.\n\nManhattan: \n- After move LEFT to (1,3): distance to (1,7) = |1-1| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- After move UP to (2,4): distance to (1,7) = |2-1| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSame Manhattan distance.\n\nBut with LEFT, I am aligned at x=1, so I can just go UP multiple times without changing x.\n\nWith UP, I am at (2,4), which is not aligned, so I need to move LEFT then UP.\n\nBut both require 4 moves to reach (1,7).\n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because it gets me to the correct x-column.\n\nMoreover, from (1,3), I can go UP to (1,4), (1,5), etc., and if I see an opportunity, I can go DOWN to (1,2) for (1,0) if enemy not going for it.\n\nBut since I think (1,7) is better, I'll go LEFT.\n\nEnemy at (6,2): it might go for (9,5) or (1,0). (9,5) is closer to it: |6-9| + |2-5| = 3+3=6, while (1,0) is |6-1|+|2-0|=5+2=7, so (9,5) is closer for enemy.\n\n(9,5) is at top right, enemy at (6,2) bottom middle.\n\nSo enemy might go RIGHT and UP.\n\nTherefore, (1,0) is less contested.\n\nBut I still prefer going for the top apples.\n\nFinal decision: Move LEFT to (1,3) to start heading toward (1,7).\n\nThen next move UP to (1,4), etc.\n\nSo move: LEFT\nensored_rationale>\nI am controlling the snake with head at (2,3) and body segments at [(2,2), (1,2)]. Possible moves:\n- UP: (2,4) - empty, safe, moves toward apples at higher y-coordinates like (1,7), (0,8), and (3,8).\n- DOWN: (2,2) - my body segment, collision would cause death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: (1,3) - empty, safe, reduces x-coordinate to align with the x=1 column where apples (1,7) and (0,8) are located.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - empty, safe, but less efficient for reaching nearby apples.\n\nThe closest apples are (1,7) at Manhattan distance 5 and (1,0) at distance 4. However, (1,0) is downward and isolated, while (1,7) is part of a cluster with (0,8) and (3,8) upward, offering better long-term point potential. Moving LEFT to (1,3) positions me to efficiently reach (1,7) in subsequent moves (e.g., UP to (1,4), etc.), with Manhattan distance to (1,7) reducing to 4 after the move. It also keeps the option open to pursue (1,0) if the enemy snake (head at (6,2)) does not threaten it\u2014though the enemy is more likely to target (9,5) or (1,0) but is far away (minimum 7 moves to (1,0)).\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,2) has no body and is not an immediate threat. It will likely move toward (9,5) (distance 6) or (1,0) (distance 7), but collision risks exist if it approaches my body segments.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I move LEFT to (1,3), I will prioritize moving UP toward (1,7) unless (1,0) becomes more viable. I will monitor the enemy's position to avoid collisions.\n\nThus, LEFT is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and strategic positioning.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nLEFT</uncensored_response>",

            "rationale": "<think> I will also include a rationale under <uncensored_rationale> if I need to explain my reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state. My snake is at head (1,3) with body at (2,3) and (2,2). The apples are at (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (1,7), and (1,0). There's also an enemy snake at head (6,1) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (1,3):\n- UP: (1,4) - currently empty\n- DOWN: (1,2) - currently occupied by my body segment (specifically, my tail)\n- LEFT: (0,3) - currently empty\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - currently occupied by my neck segment\n\nImportant note: After I move, my snake's tail will move forward since I only grow when eating an apple. That means if I don't eat an apple this turn, the tail at (2,2) will disappear and my body will become just [(1,3), (2,3)].\n\nNow evaluating move options:\n- DOWN to (1,2): This would cause me to collide with my own body at (1,2). Since this position is currently occupied, it's an instant death move. Must avoid.\n- RIGHT to (2,3): This is my neck segment, so collision with myself. Also fatal. Must avoid.\n- UP to (1,4): Empty space. Moves me closer to apple cluster at top (1,7), (0,8), (3,8).\n- LEFT to (0,3): Empty space. Moves me toward the left-side apples (0,8) and (1,7).\n\nConsidering apple positions:\n- (1,7) is directly above me at Manhattan distance 4 (1 difference in x, 4 in y)\n- (0,8) is northwest at distance 5\n- (3,8) is northeast at distance 5\n- (1,0) is directly below at distance 3\n- (9,5) is far east at distance 8\n\nEnemy snake at (6,1) poses minimal immediate threat since it's 5 units away horizontally. Its possible moves are UP to (6,2), DOWN to (6,0), LEFT to (5,1), or RIGHT to (7,1). None threaten my position directly.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- (1,0) is the closest apple but moving down would require going through my current tail position at (1,2). However, after I move away from (1,3), the tail will move and free up (1,2) next turn. \n- The top apple cluster (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) offers better long-term point potential since they're grouped.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,3) gets me into the x=0 column, perfectly aligned with (0,8) and allowing easy access to (1,7) via future UP moves.\n- Moving UP to (1,4) increases my y-position but keeps me at x=1, which is also good for reaching (1,7).\n\nAfter evaluating, moving LEFT to (0,3) seems optimal because:\n1) It's safe with no collision risk\n2) It positions me at the western edge (x=0), giving access to both (0,8) and (1,7) with minimal future moves\n3) It maintains flexibility - I could go down toward (1,0) next turn if desired, since (1,2) will be free after tail movement\n4) The enemy snake is far away and likely targeting (9,5) or (1,0) instead of the top cluster\n\nNext turn strategy note for myself: After moving LEFT, check if (1,0) is still available and enemy position. Otherwise continue upward toward the apple cluster.\n\n<uncensored_rationale>\nI am controlling the snake with head at (1,3) and body segments at [(2,3), (2,2)]. Possible moves:\n- UP: (1,4) - empty and safe, moves toward apples at higher y-coordinates like (1,7), (0,8), and (3,8).\n- DOWN: (1,2) - occupied by my body segment (tail), collision would cause death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: (0,3) - empty and safe, positions me at x=0 aligned with apple (0,8) and providing efficient access to (1,7).\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - occupied by my neck segment, collision would cause death. Not an option.\n\n(1,0) is the closest apple (distance 3) but requires moving downward after this turn. The top apple cluster (1,7), (0,8), (3,8) offers better long-term potential. Moving LEFT to (0,3) reduces x-distance to these targets and establishes optimal positioning. Manhattan distance to (0,8) becomes 5 and to (1,7) becomes 4 after the move.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,1) poses no immediate threat (minimum 5 moves away). It will likely move toward (9,5) or (1,0) but both are distant from my planned path.\n\nThus, LEFT is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and board positioning.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nLEFT",

            "rationale": "<think> I will also include a rationale under <uncensored_rationale> if I need to explain my reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state. My snake (ID: 1) has its head at (0, 3) and body at [(1, 3), (2, 3)]. The apples are at (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (1,7), and (1,0). There's an enemy snake (#0) with head at (5,1) and no body segments.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (0,3):\n- UP: (0,4) - currently empty\n- DOWN: (0,2) - currently empty\n- LEFT: (-1,3) - out of bounds (invalid, death)\n- RIGHT: (1,3) - currently occupied by my body segment\n\nEvaluating each:\n- LEFT: Invalid, would hit wall at x=-1. Immediate death.\n- RIGHT: (1,3) is my neck segment. Collision with myself. Death.\n- UP: (0,4) - empty space. Moves me toward the top-left apples (0,8) and (1,7).\n- DOWN: (0,2) - empty space. Moves me toward the apple at (1,0).\n\nApple positions:\n- (0,8): Directly above me (distance: 5 vertically)\n- (1,7): Above and to the right (distance: 4 vertically + 1 horizontally)\n- (3,8): Far right-top (distance: 5 horizontally + 5 vertically)\n- (9,5): Far right (distance: 9 horizontally + 2 vertically)\n- (1,0): Below and to the right (distance: 3 vertically down + 1 horizontally)\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (5,1) - possible moves: UP (5,2), DOWN (5,0), LEFT (4,1), RIGHT (6,1). None immediately threaten my position.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- After my move, my tail (currently at (2,3)) will move forward since I didn't eat an apple last turn. So my body will become [(1,3)] only, freeing up (2,3).\n- Moving UP gets me closer to the apple cluster at the top (0,8 and 1,7).\n- Moving DOWN gets me closer to (1,0), which is only 3 moves away vertically (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> RIGHT to (1,0).\n- However, (0,0) is currently empty and safe to move to next turn.\n\nComparing UP vs DOWN:\n- UP: Positions me for longer path to multiple apples (0,8 and 1,7)\n- DOWN: Quicker path to (1,0) with less risk\n- Enemy snake might be heading toward (1,0) since it's at (5,1) - only 4 moves away horizontally and vertically. If it moves efficiently, it could reach (1,0) in 4-5 turns.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- If enemy snake moves toward (1,0), it might beat me there if I take 3 turns to reach it.\n- The top apples are safer since enemy is far away and likely won't prioritize them immediately.\n\nFinal decision:\n- UP is better for long-term point potential. The top has multiple apples clustered.\n- DOWN is riskier because (1,0) might be contested, and it only gets me one apple.\n- Moving UP to (0,4) keeps me on the edge, which can be advantageous for avoiding traps.\n\n<uncensored_rationale>\nMy head is at (0,3). Possible moves:\n- UP to (0,4): Safe, empty, moves toward top apples. Manhattan distance to (0,8) becomes 4, to (1,7) becomes 4.\n- DOWN to (0,2): Safe, empty, moves toward (1,0) - distance to (1,0) becomes 2 (after move: go to (0,1) then (0,0) then RIGHT to (1,0)).\n- LEFT: Invalid (x=-1)\n- RIGHT: Fatal (collision with own body at (1,3))\n\n(1,0) is tempting but risky: Enemy snake at (5,1) can reach (1,0) in 4 moves (e.g., LEFT to (4,1), LEFT to (3,1), LEFT to (2,1), LEFT to (1,1), DOWN to (1,0)). I would take 3 moves to reach it. High chance of conflict or losing the apple.\n\nTop apples are safer: Enemy is 8+ moves away from them. Moving UP starts a sustainable path upward. After moving UP, next turn I can go UP to (0,5), then (0,6), etc., or eventually RIGHT to (1,7).\n\nThus, UP is the optimal move for apple-seeking efficiency and safety.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n</think>\n\nUP",

            "rationale": "<think> But first, let me assess the current state.\n\nCurrent board state:\n- My snake (ID: 1) head is at (0,4), with body at [(0,3), (1,3)]\n- Enemy snake (#0) head at (5,0) with no body\n- Apples at: (3,8), (9,5), (0,8), (1,7), (1,0)\n\nPossible moves from my head at (0,4):\n- UP: (0,5) - board shows empty at y=5, x=0? Wait, let me check the grid:\n\nLooking at the board state:\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . . \nRow 8: A . . A . . . . . .   # apples at (0,8) and (3,8)\nRow 7: . A . . . . . . . .   # apple at (1,7)\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . A   # apple at (9,5)\nRow 4: 1 . . . . . . . . .   # my head at (0,4)\nRow 3: T T . . . . . . . .   # my body at (0,3) and (1,3)\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 0: . A . . . 0 . . . .   # apple at (1,0) and enemy head at (5,0)\n\nSo for (0,4):\n- UP: (0,5) - empty (row 5, position x=0 is .)\n- DOWN: (0,3) - occupied by my own body (T for tail)\n- LEFT: (-1,4) - out of bounds (x=-1, invalid)\n- RIGHT: (1,4) - empty (row 4, position x=1 is .)\n\nSo valid moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, assessment:\n- UP to (0,5):\n  - Moves me toward apples at (0,8) and (1,7). Distance to (0,8): 3 up (manhattan). \n  - After moving, my body will shift: head at (0,5), body becomes [(0,4), (0,3)] (since I didn't eat an apple last turn? Wait, last move was UP to (0,4), which was empty, so no growth. Therefore, my tail moves from (1,3) to (0,3) and the neck becomes (0,4). After next move, body will be [(0,4), (0,3)] for a length 3 snake.\n\n- RIGHT to (1,4):\n  - Moves me toward (1,7) apple and also (3,8). Distance to (1,7): 3 up (from y=4 to y=7) and same x=1.\n  - Also gets me away from the left wall.\n\nEnemy snake at (5,0):\n- Possible moves: UP (5,1), DOWN (5,-1 invalid), LEFT (4,0), RIGHT (6,0)\n- Since no body, enemy can move freely. (5,0) is at row 0, so DOWN is invalid. So enemy can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- The apple at (1,0) is nearby, so enemy might move LEFT toward it.\n\nApple priorities:\n- Closest apples to me:\n  - (1,0): distance |0-1| + |4-0| = 1 + 4 = 5\n  - (0,8): |0-0| + |4-8| = 4\n  - (1,7): |0-1| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4\n  - (3,8): |0-3| + |4-8| = 3 + 4 = 7\n  - (9,5): |0-9| + |4-5| = 9 + 1 = 10\n\nSo (0,8) and (1,7) are equally close at manhattan distance 4, while (1,0) is farther at 5.\n\nBut (1,0) is at a low y, near the enemy. Moving toward (1,0) would require me to go down and right, which isn't directly possible from here.\n\nFrom (0,4):\n- To reach (1,0): I need to go DOWN to (0,3) but that's blocked by my body. So not possible directly. I would have to go UP or RIGHT first, then later down.\n\nBut (0,3) is my body, so I cannot go DOWN. Therefore, (1,0) is not immediately accessible.\n\nEnemy at (5,0) might go for (1,0) by moving LEFT multiple times.\n\nFor me, the top apples are more accessible.\n\nMoving UP to (0,5) gets me closer to (0,8) and (1,7). From (0,5), next move could be UP to (0,6) or RIGHT to (1,5) to head toward (1,7).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1,4) also gets me closer to (1,7) and (3,8). From (1,4), I could go UP to (1,5), then (1,6), (1,7) to eat that apple.\n\nComparing UP vs RIGHT:\n- UP: Puts me at (0,5). This keeps me on the left edge. Risk: if I stay on the edge, I have fewer escape routes.\n- RIGHT: Puts me at (1,4). This moves me inward, giving more flexibility.\n\nBut the board has many open spaces.\n\nEnemy threat: enemy is at (5,0) and has no body, so it's small and fast. It might grow if it eats an apple. But right now, it can only threaten apples near it, like (1,0) or perhaps move up.\n\nSince I am at (0,4) and enemy at (5,0), we are 5 units apart horizontally and 4 vertically, so manhattan distance 9. Not an immediate threat.\n\nApples: (0,8) is directly above me. If I go UP, in 3 moves: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8) eat apple. Similarly, (1,7) is at distance 3: from (0,4) go RIGHT to (1,4), then UP to (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) - 3 moves.\n\nBut if I go UP first to (0,5), then to get to (1,7) I need to go RIGHT then UP, which might be less direct.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,4), then I can go UP to (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) in 3 moves.\n\nEither way, I can reach an apple in 3 moves.\n\nBut (0,8) is closer vertically if I go UP.\n\nAlso, after this move, my tail will be at (0,3) and (1,3)? After my last move (UP to (0,4)), my body was [(0,3), (1,3)]. When I move next, since I didn't eat an apple, my tail moves forward. So the tail at (1,3) will be removed, and new positions: head at new position, body [old head, first body segment]. \n\nSo if I move UP to (0,5):\n- Head: (0,5)\n- Body: [(0,4), (0,3)]  // since the segment at (1,3) disappears\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,4):\n- Head: (1,4)\n- Body: [(0,4), (0,3)]  // similarly, tail at (1,3) gone\n\nIn both cases, (1,3) becomes empty.\n\nNow, safety:\n- UP (0,5): empty, safe.\n- RIGHT (1,4): empty, safe.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nLong-term strategy: I want to collect apples efficiently. The cluster at top left has (0,8) and (1,7), which are close.\n\nGoing UP might lead me to (0,8) directly, but then I could be cornered on the top edge.\n\nGoing RIGHT gives me more space to maneuver and access to (1,7) and (3,8).\n\nAlso, the apple at (1,0) is being contested by the enemy. Enemy at (5,0) might move LEFT to (4,0), then (3,0), etc. to get to (1,0). I am not in a position to get it soon, so I should avoid that area for now.\n\nTherefore, I think RIGHT is better because:\n- It positions me centrally.\n- It allows direct path to (1,7) apple.\n- From (1,4), I can choose to go UP or RIGHT next, giving flexibility.\n\nUP is also good, but it keeps me on the left edge, which might be limiting.\n\nLast turn rationale said UP was chosen to go for top apples. Now, moving RIGHT would start moving horizontally toward the cluster.\n\nBut let's see the distances:\n- From (0,4) to (1,7): manhattan |0-1| + |4-7| = 1+3=4\n- If I go UP to (0,5): distance to (1,7) becomes |0-1| + |5-7| =1+2=3\n- If I go RIGHT to (1,4): distance to (1,7) becomes |1-1| + |4-7| =0+3=3\n\nSame reduction in distance.\n\nTo (0,8):\n- From (0,4): |0-0| + |4-8| =4\n- After UP: |0-0| + |5-8| =3\n- After RIGHT: |1-0| + |4-8| =1+4=5\n\nSo UP reduces distance to (0,8), while RIGHT increases it slightly.\n\nBut (1,7) is equally reduced by both moves.\n\nI should consider which apple to target first. (0,8) and (1,7) are both at distance 4 now.\n\n(0,8) is on the edge, (1,7) is one step in. (1,7) might be better to get first because it's not on the very edge.\n\nAlso, after getting (1,7), I could go to (3,8) or others.\n\nEnemy might go for (1,0) or move upward.\n\nSince enemy has no body, it can move fast. I should not worry too much.\n\nBut to maximize points, I should go for the nearest safe path.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe and equally good in terms of distance to some apples.\n\nBut UP might lead to a dead end if I go to (0,8) and then have to come down.\n\nWhereas RIGHT opens up the board.\n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better for flexibility.\n\nLast turn I moved UP, so continuing upward might be consistent.\n\nNo need to be consistent.\n\nI'll choose RIGHT to move toward the center.\n\n<uncensored_rationale>\nMy head is at (0,4). Valid moves: UP and RIGHT.\n- UP to (0,5): Moves toward (0,8) apple, reducing manhattan distance to 3. Keeps me on the left edge, which may limit future moves.\n- RIGHT to (1,4): Moves toward (1,7) apple, reducing manhattan distance to 3. Positions me more centrally for better maneuverability and access to multiple apples (e.g., (1,7), (3,8), and eventually (9,5)).\n\nEnemy snake at (5,0) poses no immediate threat. It may target the (1,0) apple, which is far from my position and not worth competing for at this stage.\n\nMoving RIGHT is preferable as it avoids trapping myself on the edge and provides more options for future moves. The apple at (1,7) is equally reachable from (1,4) as (0,8) is from (0,5), but central positioning reduces risk.\n</uncensored_rationale>\n\nTherefore, my move is RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nRIGHT",
