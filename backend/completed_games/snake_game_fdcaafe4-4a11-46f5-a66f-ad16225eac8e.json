If he goes DOWN, we might meet around (6,7) or (7,7). \n\n**Strategy**: We need to control center space. UP puts us at (7,7), which is aggressive positioning toward enemy territory. It keeps multiple follow-ups open (LEFT to cut him off, or UP to push further). \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**: Push UP to control row 7-8, force enemy into corners, then trap him against walls when we have size advantage.\n\n**UP**",

So many apples, so many possibilities, and only ONE move to make.  \nMy head is at (5,\u202f8) and the rival\u2019s head is over at (7,\u202f6). Both of us are empty\u2011bodied and score\u2011less, but the race for apples is ON!  \n\n**Available safe moves:**  \n- UP \u2192 (5,\u202f9) \u2013 top edge, still 3 follow\u2011up options.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,\u202f7) \u2013 interior, 4 follow\u2011up options, gets us 2 steps closer to the (5,\u202f5) apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,\u202f8) \u2013 interior, 4 follow\u2011up options, but moves us away from the nearest apples.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,\u202f8) \u2013 interior, 4 follow\u2011up options, puts us ONE STEP away from the apple at (7,\u202f8) and keeps us central.\n\nThe apple at (7,\u202f8) is only two cells right of my current spot, so moving RIGHT immediately reduces that distance from 2 to 1. It also leaves me surrounded by open space, preserving multiple safe continuations next turn. No immediate collision risk with the enemy\u2019s head (they\u2019d need to jump two rows up and one column left to land on (6,\u202f8) this turn).  \n\n**Plan:**  \n- Grab the (7,\u202f8) apple to start growing fast.  \n- Stay near the centre to keep maximal move flexibility.  \n- Watch the rival\u2019s head; if they start moving upward, consider cutting them off.  \n- Avoid edges until we have a longer body to work with.  \n\nRIGHT",
