Prioritizing this apple is optimal as it\u2019s the closest and will increase apple count to 6.\n- **Enemy Behavior:** Snake #1 at (9, 3) cannot reach (8, 1) this turn. Moving DOWN avoids any potential collision.\n- **Long-Term Plan:** After moving DOWN, continue to (8, 0) to collect the apple. Then assess surrounding apples and maintain flexibility by avoiding walls and tight spaces.\n\nDOWN",
