The instruction says going backwards is illegal and causes death.

Possibly, we moved UP to (8,4), then last move LEFT, so now at (7,4).\n\nAnyway, assume the snake's head is at (7,4), with body updated accordingly.\n\nApples remaining: (1,3), (9,6), (3,6), (8,0).\n\nHence no apple at (7,4) anymore.\n\n---\n\nAssuming current head at (7,4), body at [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2)].\n\nWait, the body was previously:\n\nHead: (7,4) (our snake)\n\nBody: [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2)]\n\nYes, this matches \u2014 head at (7,4), body at four segments.\n\nNow, choose move from (7,4).\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\n- UP: (7,5) - safe?  \n(7,5) is within board, not on own body, enemy at (2,3) and body [(3,3), (4,3)] no risk here.  \nAny apple at (7,5)? No.\n\n- DOWN: (7,3)  \nInside board. Not on own body. No enemy. Apple? No.\n\n- LEFT: (6,4)  \nInside board. Not on body, no enemy. Apple? No.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,4)  \n(8,4) is in our body (second segment).

So need to maneuver around.\n\n- Alternatively approach (3,6) by moving left and up.\n\nIs there any immediate danger?\n\nEnemy at (2,3) with body at (3,3), (4,3)\n\nWe should avoid (3,3) and (4,3) since enemy body is there.\n\n---\n\nPossible safe moves:\n\n1) UP: (7,5) - moves towards (9,6) and (3,6) (vertical movement)\n\n2) DOWN: (7,3) - no apples nearby; may not be best.\n\n3) LEFT: (6,4) - towards (3,6) apple cluster on left side.\n\nOUTCOMES:\n\n- Moving UP leads us closer to apples at top.\n\n- Moving LEFT moves us horizontally toward (3,6) or (1,3).\n\n- DOWN has no immediate benefit.\n\nGo with UP to explore top and keep options open.\n\n---\n\n**Planned next move: UP**\n\n**Next strategy:**\n\n- From (7,5) move towards (9,6) or go left towards (3,6) depending on enemy positions.\n\n- Avoid enemy snake territory.\n\n---\n\nMy decided next move: UP"

The instruction says going backwards is illegal and causes death. So since we last moved LEFT to (7,4), now at (8,4), moving LEFT again would be safe because our body has moved forward?\n\nActually, after eating an apple at 7,4 (if we just took this move last turn), the snake would have grown and the tail would not move. Our body will now be larger.\n\nBut the problem states that last move was LEFT, gaining the apple at (7,4). So actually our current head should be at (7,4) now, and body updated accordingly.\n\nWait, the last statement says:\n\n**New snake head position:** (8,4)  \nPreviously moved UP to (8,4).\n\nNow last move: LEFT.\n\nThis is a bit conflicting.\n\nBut the last move info says:\n\nYour last move was **LEFT**, and rationale was: reassessing situation after moving UP to (8,4).\n\nSo perhaps we are at (8,4) now, and considering next move.\n\nApples: (1,3), (9,6), (3,6), (8,0), and (7,4) \n\nIs (7,4) apple available still? Earlier it was said 7,4 was just one step left from current head (8,4)\n\nYes, last time the apple at (7,4) was part of the apple list.\n\nBut now the list of apples remaining includes (7,4), so none eaten yet.\n\nTherefore moving LEFT to (7,4) would get an apple.\n\nOur body at (8,3), (9,3), (9,2).\n\n- Left (7,4) is unoccupied,\n\n- So moving LEFT is legal and beneficial to get apple at (7,4).\n\nHowever, the last message\u2019s conclusion decided to move LEFT.\n\nNow, after moving LEFT onto (7,4), the body will grow.\n\nOk, now current head is at (8,4), next move will be LEFT to (7,4).\n\nBUT the question is: what is the next move **from** current position (8,4)?\n\nWe are to decide the next move **now**.\n\nGiven:\n\n- We came from (7,4) via LEFT move, to (8,4) UP move, now?\n\nNo, the last move was LEFT.\n\nText says:\n\n\"Your last move information:\n\nDirection: LEFT\n\nRationale: Let's reassess after moving UP to (8,4).\"\n\nSeems contradictory. Possibly, we moved UP to (8,4), then last move LEFT, so now at (7,4).\n\nAnyway, assume the snake's head is at (7,4), with body updated accordingly.\n\nApples remaining: (1,3), (9,6), (3,6), (8,0).\n\nHence no apple at (7,4) anymore.\n\n---\n\nAssuming current head at (7,4), body at [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2)].\n\nWait, the body was previously:\n\nHead: (7,4) (our snake)\n\nBody: [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2)]\n\nYes, this matches \u2014 head at (7,4), body at four segments.\n\nNow, choose move from (7,4).\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\n- UP: (7,5) - safe?  \n(7,5) is within board, not on own body, enemy at (2,3) and body [(3,3), (4,3)] no risk here.  \nAny apple at (7,5)? No.\n\n- DOWN: (7,3)  \nInside board. Not on own body. No enemy. Apple? No.\n\n- LEFT: (6,4)  \nInside board. Not on body, no enemy. Apple? No.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,4)  \n(8,4) is in our body (second segment). Can't move into own body.\n\nSo moving RIGHT is forbidden.\n\nBest choices: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\nNow the apples remaining are:\n\n(1,3), (9,6), (3,6), (8,0)\n\nWhich are closest?\n\nFrom (7,4):\n\n- Apple at (3,6): horizontal distance 4, vertical distance 2  \n- Apple at (1,3): horizontal 6, vertical 1  \n- Apple at (9,6): horizontal 2, vertical 2  \n- Apple at (8,0): horizontal 1, vertical 4\n\nThe closest in terms of Manhattan distance is probably (9,6) and (8,0), but (8,0) is at bottom right corner; (9,6) quite close and top-right.\n\n---\n\nStrategy:\n\n- Approach (9,6) from current position by moving right, but right is blocked by own body at (8,4). So need to maneuver around.\n\n- Alternatively approach (3,6) by moving left and up.\n\nIs there any immediate danger?\n\nEnemy at (2,3) with body at (3,3), (4,3)\n\nWe should avoid (3,3) and (4,3) since enemy body is there.\n\n---\n\nPossible safe moves:\n\n1) UP: (7,5) - moves towards (9,6) and (3,6) (vertical movement)\n\n2) DOWN: (7,3) - no apples nearby; may not be best.\n\n3) LEFT: (6,4) - towards (3,6) apple cluster on left side.\n\nOUTCOMES:\n\n- Moving UP leads us closer to apples at top.\n\n- Moving LEFT moves us horizontally toward (3,6) or (1,3).\n\n- DOWN has no immediate benefit.\n\nGo with UP to explore top and keep options open.\n\n---\n\n**Planned next move: UP**\n\n**Next strategy:**\n\n- From (7,5) move towards (9,6) or go left towards (3,6) depending on enemy positions.\n\n- Avoid enemy snake territory.\n\n---\n\nMy decided next move: UP"

Earlier it was said 7,4 was just one step left from current head (8,4)\n\nYes, last time the apple at (7,4) was part of the apple list.\n\nBut now the list of apples remaining includes (7,4), so none eaten yet.\n\nTherefore moving LEFT to (7,4) would get an apple.\n\nOur body at (8,3), (9,3), (9,2).\n\n- Left (7,4) is unoccupied,\n\n- So moving LEFT is legal and beneficial to get apple at (7,4).\n\nHowever, the last message\u2019s conclusion decided to move LEFT.\n\nNow, after moving LEFT onto (7,4), the body will grow.\n\nOk, now current head is at (8,4), next move will be LEFT to (7,4).\n\nBUT the question is: what is the next move **from** current position (8,4)?\n\nWe are to decide the next move **now**.\n\nGiven:\n\n- We came from (7,4) via LEFT move, to (8,4) UP move, now?\n\nNo, the last move was LEFT.\n\nText says:\n\n\"Your last move information:\n\nDirection: LEFT\n\nRationale: Let's reassess after moving UP to (8,4).\"\n\nSeems contradictory. Possibly, we moved UP to (8,4), then last move LEFT, so now at (7,4).\n\nAnyway, assume the snake's head is at (7,4), with body updated accordingly.\n\nApples remaining: (1,3), (9,6), (3,6), (8,0).\n\nHence no apple at (7,4) anymore.\n\n---\n\nAssuming current head at (7,4), body at [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2)].\n\nWait, the body was previously:\n\nHead: (7,4) (our snake)\n\nBody: [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2)]\n\nYes, this matches \u2014 head at (7,4), body at four segments.\n\nNow, choose move from (7,4).\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\n- UP: (7,5) - safe?  \n(7,5) is within board, not on own body, enemy at (2,3) and body [(3,3), (4,3)] no risk here.  \nAny apple at (7,5)? No.\n\n- DOWN: (7,3)  \nInside board. Not on own body. No enemy. Apple? No.\n\n- LEFT: (6,4)  \nInside board. Not on body, no enemy. Apple? No.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,4)  \n(8,4) is in our body (second segment). Can't move into own body.\n\nSo moving RIGHT is forbidden.\n\nBest choices: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\nNow the apples remaining are:\n\n(1,3), (9,6), (3,6), (8,0)\n\nWhich are closest?\n\nFrom (7,4):\n\n- Apple at (3,6): horizontal distance 4, vertical distance 2  \n- Apple at (1,3): horizontal 6, vertical 1  \n- Apple at (9,6): horizontal 2, vertical 2  \n- Apple at (8,0): horizontal 1, vertical 4\n\nThe closest in terms of Manhattan distance is probably (9,6) and (8,0), but (8,0) is at bottom right corner; (9,6) quite close and top-right.\n\n---\n\nStrategy:\n\n- Approach (9,6) from current position by moving right, but right is blocked by own body at (8,4). So need to maneuver around.\n\n- Alternatively approach (3,6) by moving left and up.\n\nIs there any immediate danger?\n\nEnemy at (2,3) with body at (3,3), (4,3)\n\nWe should avoid (3,3) and (4,3) since enemy body is there.\n\n---\n\nPossible safe moves:\n\n1) UP: (7,5) - moves towards (9,6) and (3,6) (vertical movement)\n\n2) DOWN: (7,3) - no apples nearby; may not be best.\n\n3) LEFT: (6,4) - towards (3,6) apple cluster on left side.\n\nOUTCOMES:\n\n- Moving UP leads us closer to apples at top.\n\n- Moving LEFT moves us horizontally toward (3,6) or (1,3).\n\n- DOWN has no immediate benefit.\n\nGo with UP to explore top and keep options open.\n\n---\n\n**Planned next move: UP**\n\n**Next strategy:**\n\n- From (7,5) move towards (9,6) or go left towards (3,6) depending on enemy positions.\n\n- Avoid enemy snake territory.\n\n---\n\nMy decided next move: UP"

The instruction says going backwards is illegal and causes death.

Possibly, we moved UP to (8,4), then last move LEFT, so now at (7,4).\n\nAnyway, assume the snake's head is at (7,4), with body updated accordingly.\n\nApples remaining: (1,3), (9,6), (3,6), (8,0).\n\nHence no apple at (7,4) anymore.\n\n---\n\nAssuming current head at (7,4), body at [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2)].\n\nWait, the body was previously:\n\nHead: (7,4) (our snake)\n\nBody: [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2)]\n\nYes, this matches \u2014 head at (7,4), body at four segments.\n\nNow, choose move from (7,4).\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\n- UP: (7,5) - safe?  \n(7,5) is within board, not on own body, enemy at (2,3) and body [(3,3), (4,3)] no risk here.  \nAny apple at (7,5)? No.\n\n- DOWN: (7,3)  \nInside board. Not on own body. No enemy. Apple? No.\n\n- LEFT: (6,4)  \nInside board. Not on body, no enemy. Apple?

That means now body is:\n\nHead at (9,2), 1st body segment at (9,3) (previous head?), 2nd at (9,2) (some confusion), but body can't overlap head.\n\nWait, the problem said last move info:\n\n> Your position is at (9,2)\n\n> Body segments updated accordingly: so after moving UP to (9,2), the body segments are [(9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0)] \u2014 this would make the snake length 5, but original was length 4 (head + 3 body). Maybe it grew?\n\nNo, the snake started at (9,3) with body [(9,2), (9,1), (9,0)]. Moving UP to (9,2) (head moves up to (9,2), old head at (9,3) becomes first body segment, and the rest shift down).\n\nSo snake body now likely:\n\nHead: (9,2)\n\nBody: [(9,3), (9,2), (9,1)]\n\nWait, seems the tail is lost if it doesn't grow.\n\nAlternatively, the snake's body moves forward and tail segment disappears unless it grows.\n\nAssuming no apple was eaten, so the last tail square (9,0) is now free.\n\nAnyway, the previous body segment that was behind head was (9,2), so the forbidden backward direction is moving down to (9,1), because that is where the last segment is.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- UP to (9,3): This is part of our body (it's the prior head position).\n\nIs it allowed to move onto a body segment?\n\nNo, you die if you run into yourself.\n\nSo (9,3) is our old head position, which is now body, so dead if we move there.\n\n- LEFT to (8,2): Empty.\n\n- DOWN to (9,1): Our body segment, not allowed.\n\n- RIGHT to (10, 2): off board.\n\nSo only valid move is LEFT (8,2).\n\nAlso, the apple at (9, 6) remains a target but may not be accessible along this route.\n\nChecking for danger in moving LEFT (8,2):\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (5,3) with body at (5,4), so no immediate threat nearby at (8,2).\n\nThus, moving LEFT is safe and the only valid move.\n\nStrategy to consider next turns is to navigate toward the cluster of apples near (3,3) and (3,6), since the big apple at (9,6) may be out of reach safely after this.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

Continuing that plan, we\u2019ll be a diagonal step away from the target.\n\u2022 Moving DOWN or LEFT either doesn\u2019t bring us any closer or may even risk running into ourselves.\n\nWe\u2019ve reviewed our body and the enemy snake; both moving RIGHT and UP look safe. However, given that RIGHT gives us a one-step diagonal approach to (6,9) (as from our new head at (5,8), the apple at (6,9) is just one move away in both axes), it appears more optimal.\n\nThus, I decide to move RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

So actually our current head should be at (7,4) now, and body updated accordingly.\n\nWait, the last statement says:\n\n**New snake head position:** (8,4)  \nPreviously moved UP to (8,4).\n\nNow last move: LEFT.\n\nThis is a bit conflicting.\n\nBut the last move info says:\n\nYour last move was **LEFT**, and rationale was: reassessing situation after moving UP to (8,4).\n\nSo perhaps we are at (8,4) now, and considering next move.\n\nApples: (1,3), (9,6), (3,6), (8,0), and (7,4) \n\nIs (7,4) apple available still? Earlier it was said 7,4 was just one step left from current head (8,4)\n\nYes, last time the apple at (7,4) was part of the apple list.\n\nBut now the list of apples remaining includes (7,4), so none eaten yet.\n\nTherefore moving LEFT to (7,4) would get an apple.\n\nOur body at (8,3), (9,3), (9,2).\n\n- Left (7,4) is unoccupied,\n\n- So moving LEFT is legal and beneficial to get apple at (7,4).\n\nHowever, the last message\u2019s conclusion decided to move LEFT.\n\nNow, after moving LEFT onto (7,4), the body will grow.\n\nOk, now current head is at (8,4), next move will be LEFT to (7,4).\n\nBUT the question is: what is the next move **from** current position (8,4)?\n\nWe are to decide the next move **now**.\n\nGiven:\n\n- We came from (7,4) via LEFT move, to (8,4) UP move, now?\n\nNo, the last move was LEFT.\n\nText says:\n\n\"Your last move information:\n\nDirection: LEFT\n\nRationale: Let's reassess after moving UP to (8,4).\"\n\nSeems contradictory. Possibly, we moved UP to (8,4), then last move LEFT, so now at (7,4).\n\nAnyway, assume the snake's head is at (7,4), with body updated accordingly.\n\nApples remaining: (1,3), (9,6), (3,6), (8,0).\n\nHence no apple at (7,4) anymore.\n\n---\n\nAssuming current head at (7,4), body at [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2)].\n\nWait, the body was previously:\n\nHead: (7,4) (our snake)\n\nBody: [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2)]\n\nYes, this matches \u2014 head at (7,4), body at four segments.\n\nNow, choose move from (7,4).\n\nLet's check possible directions:\n\n- UP: (7,5) - safe?  \n(7,5) is within board, not on own body, enemy at (2,3) and body [(3,3), (4,3)] no risk here.  \nAny apple at (7,5)? No.\n\n- DOWN: (7,3)  \nInside board. Not on own body. No enemy. Apple? No.\n\n- LEFT: (6,4)  \nInside board. Not on body, no enemy. Apple? No.\n\n- RIGHT: (8,4)  \n(8,4) is in our body (second segment). Can't move into own body.\n\nSo moving RIGHT is forbidden.\n\nBest choices: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\nNow the apples remaining are:\n\n(1,3), (9,6), (3,6), (8,0)\n\nWhich are closest?\n\nFrom (7,4):\n\n- Apple at (3,6): horizontal distance 4, vertical distance 2  \n- Apple at (1,3): horizontal 6, vertical 1  \n- Apple at (9,6): horizontal 2, vertical 2  \n- Apple at (8,0): horizontal 1, vertical 4\n\nThe closest in terms of Manhattan distance is probably (9,6) and (8,0), but (8,0) is at bottom right corner; (9,6) quite close and top-right.\n\n---\n\nStrategy:\n\n- Approach (9,6) from current position by moving right, but right is blocked by own body at (8,4). So need to maneuver around.\n\n- Alternatively approach (3,6) by moving left and up.\n\nIs there any immediate danger?\n\nEnemy at (2,3) with body at (3,3), (4,3)\n\nWe should avoid (3,3) and (4,3) since enemy body is there.\n\n---\n\nPossible safe moves:\n\n1) UP: (7,5) - moves towards (9,6) and (3,6) (vertical movement)\n\n2) DOWN: (7,3) - no apples nearby; may not be best.\n\n3) LEFT: (6,4) - towards (3,6) apple cluster on left side.\n\nOUTCOMES:\n\n- Moving UP leads us closer to apples at top.\n\n- Moving LEFT moves us horizontally toward (3,6) or (1,3).\n\n- DOWN has no immediate benefit.\n\nGo with UP to explore top and keep options open.\n\n---\n\n**Planned next move: UP**\n\n**Next strategy:**\n\n- From (7,5) move towards (9,6) or go left towards (3,6) depending on enemy positions.\n\n- Avoid enemy snake territory.\n\n---\n\nMy decided next move: UP"

Move LEFT (6,1), then DOWN (6,0) to eat apple.\n\n2. Move RIGHT (8,1), then DOWN (8,0) to eat apple.\n\nWhich is quicker and safer? Both seem similar.\n\nCheck that my body does not block those paths:\n\n- My body is vertical at (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), etc., so moving LEFT or RIGHT at row 1 is clear.\n\nDeciding between LEFT and RIGHT:\n\n- Moving LEFT might position me better to get to (6,0) then (1,0).\n\n- Moving RIGHT might let me get (8,0) quicker, then (6,0).\n\nBoth are viable.\n\nGiven the current position, moving LEFT to (6,1) is preferable because it's closer to the cluster of bottom apples at (1,0) and (6,0).\n\nNext move: LEFT.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nOnce I move to (6,1), move DOWN to (6,0) to eat the apple, then consider going towards (1,0) or (0,4).\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

Wait\u2014there's a bit of confusion here:\n\n- Earlier, you said you moved DOWN to (7,1) eating an apple at (7,1).\n\n- Your last move was LEFT (per your last move info).\n\nSo current head is at (7,1) or (6,1)?\n\nFrom the initial info, starting snake head was at (6,1), body as given.\n\nThen last move was DOWN to (7,1), you ate apple at (7,1).\n\nThen your very last move was LEFT, so the head should now be at (6,1).\n\nDouble check:\n\n- Before last move, head was at (7,1).\n\n- You moved LEFT, so head now is at (6,1).\n\nOk, so current head position is (6,1).\n\nBody accordingly includes previous segments, and snake has grown from eating apple at (7,1).\n\nApples that remain: (8,0), (6,0), (0,4), (1,0), (5,0).\n\nEnemy snake #1 is far away in top side.\n\nYour body is occupying positions near (7,2),(7,3), etc. so going UP to (6,2) should be free if not occupied by your own body.\n\nThe best next moves would be to get that apple at (6,0) or nearby apples at the bottom row.\n\nAt (6,1), possible moves:\n\n- UP to (6,2): check if occupied\n\n- DOWN to (6,0): apple is there\n\n- LEFT to (5,1): is this free? Apple at (5,0) is below there, possible path.\n\n- RIGHT to (7,1): now occupied by your own body? Actually you just left that position.\n\nGiven that going DOWN to (6,0) lands you on an apple directly, that is the best move.\n\nThat also aligns with your prior strategy.\n\nSo next move: DOWN.\n\n**Strategy after that:** After eating (6,0) apple, proceed towards (5,0), then (1,0), then (0,4) for further apples.\n\nProceed carefully to avoid trapping yourself.\n\nNext move: DOWN"

Yes, not occupied by body or enemy.\n\n- LEFT to (5,1): also free.\n\n- RIGHT to (7,1): your own body currently occupies (7,1), seems occupied.\n\nSo LEFT, DOWN, UP are options; RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nThe apple at (6,0) is immediately reachable by moving DOWN.
