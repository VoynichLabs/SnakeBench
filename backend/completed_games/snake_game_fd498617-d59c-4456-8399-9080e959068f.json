This is off the board (y=0 is bottom-left, so y=1 is the second row from bottom). This move is invalid because it would go off the board.\n2. **DOWN**: Move from (1,1) to (2,1). This is safe as it is within the board.\n3. **LEFT**: Move from (1,1) to (0,1). This is the same as UP, off the board.\n4. **RIGHT**: Move from (1,1) to (2,2). This is safe as it is within the board.\n\nSo, the only safe moves are **DOWN** and **RIGHT**.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves:\n\n#### Move DOWN to (2,1):\n- **Immediate Check**: No immediate collision with enemy or own body.\n- **Future Considerations**:\n  - The snake is currently at (1,1). Moving down to (2,1) is a safe step forward.\n  - The snake is now at (2,1). The next move would be to extend the body to (3,1) if it eats an apple.\n  - The closest apple is (4,4) and (6,1). Moving down to (2,1) is not immediately close to any apple, but it's a safe and neutral step.\n  - The enemy snake is at (8,0), which is far away and not a threat in the near future.\n\n#### Move RIGHT to (2,2):\n- **Immediate Check**: No immediate collision with enemy or own body.\n- **Future Considerations**:\n  - Moving right to (2,2) is a more direct step towards the apple at (2,6) and (3,5).\n  - This move is more promising for reaching apples sooner.\n  - The snake is now at (2,2), which is closer to the apple at (2,6) and (3,5) than being at (2,1).\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- **Short-term**: Prioritize reaching apples quickly while avoiding collisions.\n- **Mid-term**: Try to expand towards the top-right corner where apples are located, while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position and potential future moves.\n\n### Decision:\nThe move **RIGHT** to (2,2) is more advantageous as it moves the snake closer to apples and keeps future options open.\n\n**RIGHT**",

UP is slightly better as it also positions me to potentially reach other apples like (3,5) or (4,4) in future moves.\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turns:\n- Continue moving toward the cluster of apples in the center/middle of the board\n- Be cautious of the enemy snake's position but it's currently far away\n- Prioritize the apple at (6,1) first as it's closest\n- After that, consider moving toward (4,4) or (3,5)\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate collision risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Prioritization & Path Analysis**\n1. **Apple at (6,1):**\n   - Distance from current head (2,1): 4 steps (down 4x).\n   - If moving **DOWN**, the snake will pass through (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n   - **Risk:** No immediate collision, but if the enemy moves toward (6,1), they could intercept. However, since Snake #0 is far away, this is unlikely.\n\n2. **Apple at (2,6):**\n   - Distance: 6 steps (up 6x).\n   - Moving **UP** would take 6 turns to reach, which is inefficient.\n\n3. **Apple at (3,5):**\n   - Distance: ~5 steps (diagonal is not possible; must go right/up).\n   - Moving **UP** to (1,1) or **RIGHT** to (2,2) first would require detours.\n\n**Conclusion:** The **DOWN** move is the fastest way to reach the nearest apple (6,1) without immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Movement Consideration**\n- Snake #0 is at (9,1) with no body. It cannot move into (6,1) in one step, so no collision risk.\n- If Snake #0 moves **UP** to (8,1) next turn, it could block (6,1) later, but this is a long-term risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (for future self)**\n**Next 3 Turns:**\n- **Turn 2:** Prioritize (6,1) via DOWN. If enemy moves toward (6,1), consider a detour (e.g., RIGHT to (2,2) then DOWN).\n- **Turn 3:** If (6,1) is blocked, look for (2,6) or (3,5) via UP/RIGHT.\n- **Turn 4:** Expand body toward (2,6) or (3,5) if (6,1) is lost.\n\n**Key:** Avoid moving into (2,0) (backwards) or (9,1) (enemy). Always check if the next cell is safe before committing.\n\n---\n**Final Decision:** DOWN",
