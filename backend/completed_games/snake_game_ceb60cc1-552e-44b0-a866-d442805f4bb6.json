Moving Up from (0,3) is the only direction that keeps me away from the wall at Y=0 and avoids snake #1 effectively.\n\nChoosing to go UP aims to get me closer to higher Y positions without colliding, and potentially clear space from the danger zone around snake #1 at (2,8).\n\n**Strategy: avoid snake #1, aim for point gain without risking collision.**\n\n**Next move: UP**",
