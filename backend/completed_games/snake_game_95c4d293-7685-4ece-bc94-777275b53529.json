Safe move. It follows the previous plan of clearing the right column. After eating, the snake grows to length 4.\n    *   **LEFT (8, 7)**: Safe move into empty space, but it moves away from the immediate apple at (9, 6).\n    *   **UP (9, 8)**: Collides with my own body (neck). Fatal.\n    *   **RIGHT (10, 7)**: Moves off the board. Fatal.\n\n2.  **Strategy**:\n    *   Collecting the apple at (9, 6) is efficient and safe.\n    *   Staying on the edge (column 9) keeps the center of the board open for maneuvering later.\n    *   After (9, 6), the next target is likely (7, 4). I can approach it from the bottom right.\n\n3.  **Opponent**:\n    *   Snake #1 is at (0, 9), far away on the opposite side. No immediate threat.\n\nPlan: Collect the apple at (9, 6). Then navigate towards (7, 4), likely by moving DOWN to row 4 or 5 and turning LEFT.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",
