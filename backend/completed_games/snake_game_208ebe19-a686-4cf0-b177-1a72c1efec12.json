Let's evaluate each direction:\n\n1. **UP**: (4,1)\n   - Check if (4,1) is on the board: Yes (0 \u2264 4 \u2264 9, 0 \u2264 1 \u2264 9).\n   - Check if it's occupied by enemy or your own body: Enemy is at (7,1), so no collision.\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **DOWN**: (4, -1)\n   - Off the board (y < 0). **Immediate death**.\n\n3. **LEFT**: (3, 0)\n   - On board.\n   - Check if occupied: No (enemy at (7,1), no body).\n   - Safe move.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: (5, 0)\n   - On board.\n   - Check if occupied: No.\n   - Safe move.\n\n### Next Steps: Safe Moves\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Apple Proximity and Strategy\n- **UP (4,1)**: Closest to apple at (2,8) and (0,9). However, moving up is a vertical move, and the snake will grow vertically. The next turn, you'll need to decide how to grow horizontally to reach apples like (6,3) or (5,4).\n- **LEFT (3,0)**: Moving left is a horizontal move. This could be good for reaching apples like (6,3) or (8,4) in the future.\n- **RIGHT (5,0)**: Similar to LEFT but slightly more to the right. This could also be good for reaching apples like (6,3) or (8,4).\n\n### Enemy Movement Consideration\n- Enemy is at (7,1). If you move UP to (4,1), the enemy could move to (7,0) or (7,2) next turn. If you move LEFT or RIGHT, the enemy might not be immediately threatening.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\n- **Goal**: Grow the snake to reach apples like (6,3) or (8,4) while avoiding collisions.\n- **Short-term**: Since you're just a single cell, prioritize moves that open up more options for future growth. Moving LEFT or RIGHT will allow you to grow horizontally, which is more flexible for reaching apples in the middle of the board.\n- **Apple (5,4)**: This is a good target. Moving LEFT or RIGHT will allow you to grow towards the middle of the board, where apples are more concentrated.\n\n### Decision\nBetween LEFT and RIGHT, LEFT (3,0) is slightly more favorable because it's closer to the apple at (6,3) and (8,4). Moving RIGHT would be slightly more distant from these apples.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, no: in the coordinate system, `(0,0)` is bottom-left, `(9,9)` is top-right. So `(2,1)` moving UP would go to `(2,2)` (y increases upward). Wait, the board shows `y=0` at the bottom, so `(2,1)` moving UP would go to `(2,2)` (valid). But the board shows `y=0` at the bottom, so `(2,1)` moving UP is `(2,2)` (valid). But the last move was DOWN, so the head is now at `(2,1)` (assuming the board is correct). Wait, the board shows your head at `(1,0)` in the last move info, but the board state shows your head at `(2,1)`. This is inconsistent. I'll assume the board state is correct: your head is at `(2,1)`.\n\n   - Moving UP from `(2,1)` goes to `(2,2)`.\n   - No immediate danger (no enemy body or apple there).\n   - But this doesn't advance toward the closest apple `(5,4)`; it's a neutral move.\n\n2. **DOWN (2, 2):**\n   - Valid move.\n   - Directly moves toward `(5,4)` (closest apple).\n   - Enemy body is at `(1,6)`, `(1,7)`, `(2,6)`\u2014no immediate collision risk.\n   - Safe follow-up moves: from `(2,2)`, you can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT (1, 1):**\n   - Valid move.\n   - But enemy Snake #0 has a body at `(1,6)` and `(1,7)`. If Snake #0 moves LEFT toward `(0,6)` or `(1,5)`, it could block your expansion to the left.\n   - Risky if Snake #0 is aggressive.\n\n4. **RIGHT (3, 1):**\n   - Valid move.\n   - But this leaves a vertical gap if Snake #0 moves DOWN to `(1,5)` or `(2,5)`.\n   - Risky if Snake #0 expands downward.\n\n### **Enemy Threat:**\n- Snake #0\u2019s body is vertical at `(1,6)` and `(1,7)`. If it moves LEFT, it could block your expansion to the left.\n- If Snake #0 moves DOWN, it could threaten your rightward expansion.\n\n### **Best Move:**\n**DOWN (2, 2)** is the safest and most strategic move. It:\n- Moves you directly toward the closest apple `(5,4)`.\n- Minimizes risk of collision with Snake #0\u2019s body.\n- Keeps future options open (you can expand UP, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn).\n\n### **Long-Term Plan for Future Self:**\n1. **Turn 1:** Move DOWN to `(2,2)` and secure `(5,4)`.\n2. **Turn 2:** After eating the apple, move UP to `(3,4)` to expand toward the center.\n3. **Turn 3:** Expand LEFT or RIGHT to cover more ground while avoiding Snake #0\u2019s potential threats.\n4. **Avoid Backtracking:** Never move backward (e.g., from `(2,1)` to `(3,1)`).\n5. **Watch Enemy:** If Snake #0 moves aggressively, prioritize moves that keep you in the center or expand in safer directions.\n\n---\nDOWN",
