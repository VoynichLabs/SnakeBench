UP:\n   - No immediate threats\n   - Would move to (5, 9)\n   - Avoids self-collision\n   - No apple in direct path\n\n2. DOWN:\n   - Would move to (5, 7)\n   - Brings me closer to apple at (3, 4)\n   - Maintains strategic positioning\n   - Lower risk of self-collision\n\n3. LEFT:\n   - Would move to (4, 8)\n   - Potentially opening path to (3, 4) apple\n   - Moderate risk\n\n4. RIGHT:\n   - Would move to (6, 8)\n   - No clear apple path\n   - Moderate risk\n\nStrategic Thinking:\n- DOWN seems most strategic\n- Brings me closer to an apple\n- Maintains good board positioning\n- Keeps movement options open\n\nNext Turn Strategy:\n- Navigate towards (3, 4) apple\n- Maintain flexible movement\n- Avoid self-collision and wall boundaries\n\nDecision Rationale:\nDOWN provides the best balance of strategic positioning and potential apple collection.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
