Our immediate concerns:\n\n1. **Adjacent threats**: The enemy snake at (7,8), directly to our left. Moving LEFT would cause us to collide with the enemy or at least collide with the grid boundary if we move further left. Since the enemy is at (7,8), moving LEFT from (8,8) will take us to (7,8), which currently is occupied by the enemy. Colliding with an enemy results in death.\n\n2. **Movement options**:\n   - **UP**: moves from (8,8) to (8,9), which is a safe move. Also, (8,9) is within bounds, and no threats are there.\n   - **DOWN**: moves to (8,7). Not occupied, safe, but this path doesn't lead directly to any apples.\n   - **LEFT**: would go to (7,8), which is occupied by the enemy, so not safe.\n   - **RIGHT**: to (9,8). Is it safe? (9,8) is free; moving right besides being safe is also interesting because there are apples at (9,7) (bottom of (9,7)) and possibly gives access to pathways.\n\n3. **Prioritize apples**:\n   - The closest apples in our immediate vicinity:\n     - (9,7): directly above (9,6) which is no closer, but it's directly above the apple at (9,7). Moving towards it might be promising.\n     - (7,6): to the left and just below.\n     - (5,7) and (5,4): farther away.\n     - (1,4): very far.\n\nGiven that, moving UP toward (8,9) seems safe and can position us to approach the apple at (9,7) next.\n\n**Next step:**\n\n- Moving UP from (8,8) to (8,9) is safe since it\u2019s within the bounds and not occupied.\n- Moving UP also positions us nearer to the apples at (9,7) and (7,6). \n- It also avoids the enemy snake blocking or threatening immediate collision at (7,8) if we go UP.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**\n\nNext move: **UP**"
