DOWN is towards the wall.\n3.  **Strategy**: UP is the most flexible move. It moves me off the bottom wall and towards the center, keeping options open for (4, 6) if the enemy ignores it, or allowing a path to the right-side apples later. It is equidistant to (4, 6) compared to moving RIGHT, but strictly better for reaching the higher apples at y=9.\n\nPlan: Move UP to get closer to the main playing area.

The opponent (Snake 1) is centered at (6, 6) with 4 apples.\n2.  **Targets:** The apple at (0, 0) is 4 moves away if I continue LEFT. Path: (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0).\n3.  **Opponent Status:** The opponent is close to apples at (4, 6) and (6, 8). Their distance to (0, 0) is 12. They are not a threat to my target.\n4.  **Safety:** Moving LEFT to (3, 0) is perfectly safe. The area (0-3, 0-5) is completely empty. Moving UP to (4, 1) is also safe but increases the distance to the target apple.\n5.  **Plan:** Stick to the previous plan. Secure the apple at (0, 0) which is uncontested. This requires moving LEFT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move LEFT is safe, direct, and optimal for collecting the nearest apple. No other move offers a better reward/risk ratio.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1.  Move LEFT to (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0) to eat the apple.\n2.  After eating at (0, 0), immediately turn UP to (0, 1) to avoid being trapped in the corner.\n3.

Moves adjacent to my body segment at `(1, 0)`.\n    *   **DOWN:** Blocked by body segment `(0, 0)`.\n    *   **LEFT:** Blocked by wall.\n3.  **Strategy:** My immediate goal, as determined in the previous turn, is to move towards the apple at `(5, 2)`. My opponent is currently at `(5, 8)`, which is far away, and they are adjacent to an apple at `(6, 8)`. They will almost certainly take the closer apple, calculating that I am closer to `(5, 2)`.\n4.  **Path Comparison:**\n    *   **Path A (UP):** Move `(0, 2)` then Right. This puts me on row `y=2`. It leaves row `y=1` empty between my path and my body at `y=0`. This is slightly less space-efficient (leaving a 1-wide gap).\n    *   **Path B (RIGHT):** Move `(1, 1)` then Right. This keeps me on row `y=1`. I will be moving parallel to my existing body on row `y=0`. This \"hugs\" my own body, keeping my snake's footprint compact and leaving the larger open space (rows 2-9) available for future maneuvering. It connects smoothly to the target apple `(5, 2)`.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Moving **RIGHT** is the most robust move. It follows standard Snake strategy of hugging walls/bodies to conserve space and moves efficiently toward the objective.\n\n**plan**\n1.  Move **RIGHT** to `(1, 1)`.\n2.  Continue moving **RIGHT** along the `y=1` row towards the apple at `(5, 2)`.\n3.  Monitor the enemy snake at the top of the board to ensure they don't dive down, although they are expected to eat the apple at `(6, 8)`.\n\nRIGHT",

This increases points and length. Following this, the safest territory is the left side of the board (columns 0-4), which is largely empty. Moving into the right side (columns 6-9) risks getting trapped by the enemy.\n5.  **Lookahead:** After `(5, 4)`, the best move will be **LEFT** to `(4, 4)`.

It moves away from the enemy and secures the empty left territory. It sets up a straight, safe path DOWN to the closest apple at `(4, 0)`.\n    *   **RIGHT to `(6, 4)`:** Moves towards the enemy and contested apples.

This cell is empty and not occupied by any snake\u2019s body, so it is safe.  \n   - **UP** leads to `(6,9)`. This cell is also empty and safe.  \n   - **RIGHT** leads to `(7,8)`. This cell is empty and not occupied by any snake\u2019s body, so it is safe.\n\n2. **Collision with enemies**  \n   Enemy\u202f#0 can only move **down** to `(2,7)` or **right** to `(3,8)` this turn. None of those destinations intersect with any of our proposed new heads, so all three safe directions avoid a head\u2011on collision.\n\n3. **Proximity to apples**  \n   - Distance to the nearest apple `(9,6)` from the current head `(6,8)` is 5.  \n   - Moving **RIGHT** to `(7,8)` reduces that distance to 4.  \n   - Moving **DOWN** to `(6,7)` also reduces the distance to 4, but it moves us away from the right\u2011hand side of the board where the other apples `(9,5)` and `(9,6)` lie.  \n   - Moving **UP** actually increases the distance to the closest apples, so it is the least desirable.\n\n4. **Future options**  \n   From `(7,8)` we will still have three viable directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) after the move, preserving flexibility. From `(6,7)` moving **down** again would soon run into our own body, limiting options more quickly.\n\n5. **Overall strategy**  \n   - Prioritize moves that keep us alive.  \n   - Among safe moves, choose the one that pushes us toward reachable apples while leaving multiple future directions open.  \n   - **RIGHT** satisfies both: it is safe, brings us closer to the cluster of apples on the right side, and maintains flexibility for subsequent turns.\n\n**Decision:** MOVE RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

The neighbor `(0, 5)` is my tail; since I will grow, the tail segment at `(0, 5)` will remain for this turn, but `(1, 4)` and `(2, 5)` are valid escape routes, so I won't be trapped.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to empty space but delays eating the apple. It offers no significant strategic advantage over moving DOWN.\n\nThe opponent (Snake #1) is at `(8, 7)`, far away on the right side of the board and surrounded by its own body, making it impossible for it to contest the apple at `(1, 5)` or cut me off on the left side anytime soon.\n\n**strategy**\nMove **DOWN** to eat the apple at `(1, 5)`.

Moving right keeps me closer to the congested upper area.\n- If I move **DOWN** to `(1, 4)`, I enter the open bottom-left region of the board (`y=0..4`). This area is free of snakes and provides a direct, unobstructed path to the apples at `(4, 3)` and `(5, 1)`.\n\n**strategy**\nMove **DOWN** to `(1, 4)` to access the lower corridor. From there, move right towards `(4, 3)` (arriving in ~5 turns) and then `(5, 1)`. This avoids the clutter and blockades in the upper rows. Snake 1 is distant and occupied with apples on the far right.\n\n**plan**\nMove **DOWN** to `(1, 4)`. Follow up with moves towards `(2, 4)` or `(2, 3)` to navigate to the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is currently at `(8, 3)` and likely targeting the apple at `(7, 2)`.

They can move UP to `(7, 4)` or LEFT to `(6, 3)`.\n    *   If they move LEFT to `(6, 3)`, their next moves are constrained. `(5, 3)` is a semi-dead-end (surrounded by my body and their tail), but `(5, 4)` becomes available as their tail moves.\n    *   Even if they move towards me aggressively via `(6, 3) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 1)`, it takes them 4 turns to reach `(5, 1)`. By then, moving LEFT, I will be at `(2, 1)`, safely out of reach.\n\n*   **My Opportunities**:\n    *   **LEFT**: Moving to `(4, 1)` is the most direct path to the apple at `(2, 1)` (3 steps). The path `(4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1)` is safe. This direction also moves me towards the open left side of the board (column 0), where two more apples (`(0, 7)` and `(0, 9)`) reside. My body forms a vertical wall at x=1 (y=3 to 7), so I need to go under it (y < 3) to reach the left wall, which this move facilitates.\n    *   **DOWN**: Moving to `(5, 0)` is safe but slower (5 steps vertically to reach the apple). It's unnecessary since row 1 is not threatened.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Moves towards the larger enemy and offers no immediate benefits or apples.\n\n**strategy**\nMove **LEFT** to quickly secure the apple at `(2, 1)`. Afterwards, navigate trought the bottom-left opening `(1, 1) -> (0, 1)` to access the safe corridor on column 0 and head UP for the topmost apples. This path minimizes interaction with the enemy snake on the right side.\n\n**plan**\nImmediate moves: LEFT to (4, 1), then (3, 1), then (2, 1) to eat.\nFuture: Navigate to column 0 via (1, 1) or (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0), then go UP along the left edge for remaining apples.\n\nLEFT",

This is completely safe. The subsequent plan would be to move to (0, 1) and then travel UP along the empty `x=0` column. This path targets two apples at (0, 7) and (0, 9).\n    *   **Pros**: This path is protected by my own body segments at `x=1` (specifically (1, 3) through (1, 7)), creating a wall between me and the enemy. It secures a safe corridor to collect multiple apples.\n    *   **Enemy**: The enemy is at (5, 4) and is highly likely to move LEFT to (4, 4) to consume an apple. The enemy is blocked from moving DOWN by my body at (4, 3) and (5, 2), effectively isolating them in the upper/right portion of the board while I secure the bottom-left.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 0)**: Moving DOWN allows travel along the bottom edge. I could head right towards the apple at (6, 0) or left towards `x=0`.\n    *   **Comparison**: Heading to (6, 0) puts me closer to the enemy's potential territory and only yields 1 apple immediately. Heading left via (1, 0) takes 1 turn longer to reach the top-left apples compared to the (1, 1) path.\n3.  **UP (2, 2)**: This leads into the center of my own coil. While safe immediately, it offers less freedom than the `x=0` highway.\n\n**Conclusion**: The move to (1, 1) is the most efficient entry point to the safe and apple-rich `x=0` column. The enemy is too far away to pose an immediate threat, and my body wall provides excellent passive defense.\n\n**Plan**: Move LEFT to (1, 1), then continue LEFT to (0, 1), then move UP along the left wall to collect apples at (0, 7) and (0, 9).\n\nLEFT",

The enemy would have to travel around my body or wait for my tail to recede, by which time I will have secured the position.\n    *   **Strategic Value**: Secures two apples and controls the left edge entirely.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 0)**: Moves to the bottom edge. Safe. I could then go Left or Right. Going Left to (0, 0) and then Up is just a slower version of the \"LEFT\" move.

Therefore, this path carries an unacceptable risk of forced loss.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 0)**: This moves into the corner (0, 0). From here, I can travel RIGHT along the bottom edge (row 0) to collect apples at (6, 0) and (8, 0). This path is extremely safe.

While column 9 is currently partially blocked by the enemy's body at (9, 5), the enemy moves before I reach that spot. Calculations confirm the blockage will clear (around turn 81) well before I arrive (around turn 84), creating a safe corridor to the upper board and the apple at (6, 9).\n\n**Rationale:**\nI am currently at (6, 0).\n-   **Safety:** The enemy snake (Head at 0, 8) is far away in the top-left quadrant and cannot reach me. The local area is safe from head-on collisions.\n-   **Objectives:** The apple at (8, 0) is 2 moves away via the RIGHT path. Although UP (6, 1) is a valid move, it is slower to the apple and moves me closer to the enemy's static body wall, restricting movement.\n-   **Escape Route:** My body partially blocks the left side of this area, and the enemy blocks the top. The only reliable escape from this bottom section is up the right edge (column 9). Moving RIGHT aligns me perfectly with this exit strategy.\n\nRIGHT",

Column 9 is the only viable escape route to the upper board. The enemy tail currently blocking (9, 5) will vacate that spot (around turn 82) well before I arrive (around turn 85), ensuring a clear path.\n\n**Rationale:**\nI am at (7, 0).\n-   **Survival:** UP to (7, 1) leads into a cramped area with dead ends at (6, 1) and (8, 1), bounded by my body and the enemy's static body segments. LEFT is my body. DOWN is a wall. RIGHT is the only move that maintains multiple future options.\n-   **Objectives:** The apple at (8, 0) is immediately adjacent. Taking it gives me a point and positions me perfectly to access the rightmost column (column 9).\n-   **Enemy Analysis:** The enemy (Head 0,9) is far away in the top-left. Its body forms a barrier in the middle-right (cols 6-8), but the tail segments blocking my path up column 9 are receding. Calculations show the blockage at (9, 5) will clear by Turn 82, and I will arrive there Turn 85, making the ascent safe.\n\nRIGHT",

Although currently blocked by the enemy's tail at (9, 5) and (9, 6), these segments will vacate cleanly turn-by-turn as the enemy moves, clearing the path before my head arrives.\n3.  **Collision Avoidance:** Calculate the collision timing. The enemy head (at 2, 9) moving towards the apple (at 6, 9) and then the top-right corner (9, 9) will arrive at the choke point (9, 8) on Turn 88. My snake would also arrive at (9, 8) on Turn 88. To prevent a fatal head-on collision (which I would lose due to lower score), I will exit the column early by turning LEFT into row 6, 7, or 8, depending on the enemy's exact movements.\n\n**Rationale:**\nMoving UP to (9, 1) is the only move that keeps me alive this turn. DOWN and RIGHT allow no movement (walls), and LEFT leads directly into my own body (segment at 8, 0). The move positions me to exploit the clearing provided by the enemy's tail in column 9, offering the safest route out of the bottom-right corner.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

This path keeps my head far from the enemy head (currently active at the top of the board), significantly reducing collision risk compared to the narrow column 9 ascent.\n\n**Rationale:**\nMoving UP to (9, 2) forces me into a long, single-tile wide corridor in column 9.

The enemy is currently preoccupied in the upper section of the board, leaving this area uncontested.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe move LEFT to (4, 1) is the optimal choice for both safety and strategic positioning. It maintains a solid defensive \"wall\" along the bottom of the board by filling row 1 adjacent to my body in row 0, rather than floating up into row 2 and leaving a gap. This maximizes future movement options by keeping the open space contiguous. The enemy snake is far away with its head at (6, 8) and body forming a barrier around y=4, so there is no immediate threat of collision or encirclement. This path provides the most direct and secure route to the apple at (2, 2) and the subsequent cluster on the left.\n\nLEFT",

It secures a point and positions the head to enter the \"left corridor\" (columns 0 and 1) from the bottom. The enemy snake's body creates a solid wall at y=7 (x=0,1) and x=2 (y=4..7), turning the top-left area into a cul-de-sac.

The enemy snake (ID 1) is operating in the upper-right quadrant and is blocked from entering the bottom-left area (where I am) by its own body wall along x=2 (from y=4 to y=7) and y=4. This creates a protected pocket for me to safely collect the apples at (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), and (1, 6).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Move LEFT to (1, 2):** This aligns the head with column 1 to begin a systematic sweep.\n2.  **Execute Loop Pattern (Up Col 1, Down Col 0):** This is the most efficient way to clear the dead-end while maintaining safety. The path is:\n    *   **Up:** (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 5) [Apple] -> (1, 6) [Apple].\n    *   **Turn:** (1, 6) -> (0, 6).\n    *   **Down:** (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) [Apple] -> (0, 3) [Apple] -> (0, 2).\n3.  **Exit Strategy:** After reaching (0, 2), exit via (0, 1) to (1, 1). By that time, my tail (currently at 1,0) will have moved forward significantly, clearing the path along y=0 to escape to the right side of the board.\n\n**Rationale:**\nMoving LEFT is the optimal start for this pattern. It places the body into the \"interior\" of the pocket (column 1), leaving the outer edge (column 2) and the gap at (2, 3) available as a buffer or potential alternative path later, although unnecessary. The enemy cannot reach (1, 2) or interfere with this sequence due to the physical barriers of its own body. This move secures clean access to 4 uncontested apples.\n\nLEFT",

It is surrounded by my body segments at (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 1), none of which will move for many turns. Entering (1, 1) traps me with no escape.\n    *   **DOWN (1, -1):** Wall.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 0):** My own body (neck). Instant death.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 0):** Empty. This path leads down a corridor along row y=0.\n3.  **Tunnel Dynamics:**\n    *   The corridor at y=0 is bounded above by my body segments at y=1 (specifically (2,1) through (9,1)).\n    *   These segments are near my tail. The tail is at (9,1). As I move, these segments will vacate sequentially from right to left (9,1 then 8,1 then 7,1...).\n    *   I can safely travel RIGHT to collect the apple at (3, 0).\n4.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   After collecting the apple at (3,0), I should continue moving RIGHT.\n    *   Enemy Snake 1 is at (9,6) and is likely to come down column 9 or column 8 to get the apples at (7,4), (7,3), and (7,2). This puts the rightmost part of the board (x=7,8,9) in a contested or blocked state.\n    *   Calculations show that the ceiling of my tunnel at y=1 will clear locally at x=6 by Turn 106 (my T+4 move puts me at (6,0), and simultaneously (6,1) clears).\n    *   Therefore, the safest strategy is to go to (6,0), then turn UP to (6,1), and then loop back LEFT towards x=0. This utilizes the space my tail is leaving behind and keeps me away from the enemy snake on the right.\n\n**Immediate Move:**\nThe only safe and constructive move is RIGHT.\n\n**plan**\nI will move RIGHT to (2,0) and continue to (3,0) to eat the apple. I cannot go UP (trap) or LEFT (death). I will continue RIGHT along the bottom row (y=0) while my tail segments at y=1 recede. I calculate that the segment at (6,1) will vacate just in time for me to move UP from (6,0) to (6,1) around turn T+5. This allows me to perform a \"hook\" turn: go deep into the tunnel, turn UP, then turn LEFT to loop back into the space vacated by my body, avoiding the dangerous confrontation with Snake 1 near the apples at x=7 and x=8.\n**final move**\nRIGHT",

(2, -1) is off-board. **RIGHT (3, 0)** is the only legal move.\n2.  **Objective:** The move to (3, 0) collects an apple.\n3.  **Future Geometry:** My body segments at y=1 will vacate sequentially from right to left (tail is at 8,1). The tunnel \"ceiling\" at (6, 1) is calculated to open at the end of Turn 106 (after 3 more steps from (3,0)). This perfectly aligns with my arrival at (6, 0).\n4.  **Strategy:** I will proceed RIGHT to (6, 0). Then, I will turn UP to (6, 1) and immediately hook LEFT to (5, 1), looping back into the safe space vacated by my tail. This path avoids the dead-end at x=9 and keeps me away from Enemy 1, who is descending column 9/8 to eat apples in column 7.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Move:** RIGHT is mandatory to survive.\n*   **Enemy:** Enemy 1 is at (9, 5) and will likely target apples at (7, 4), (7, 3), keeping them occupied in columns 7-9 while I execute my turn at column 6.\n\n**plan**\nMove RIGHT to (3,0) to eat. Continue RIGHT to (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). At (6,0), turn UP to (6,1) (which will be empty then) and turn LEFT to (5,1) to loop back west, avoiding the enemy snake on the east side.\n**final move**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

It also keeps the spacious right\u2011hand side of the board open for future maneuvers, preserving multiple viable directions. DOWN offers no immediate gain and moves us away from the nearest apple, while still leaving us with fewer open options. Therefore LEFT best satisfies the goal of scoring while maintaining flexibility.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to eat the (7,4) apple, then evaluate next turn for moving toward (7,3) or other reachable apples, always checking for collisions with our body and the opponent.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy is only 3 moves away from (4, 6) and 2 moves away from (2, 9) and (4, 9). The enemy has a significant advantage for the current batch of apples in the top-left quadrant.\n2.  **Direction**: Moving UP reduces my distance to all the apples in the y=4 to y=9 range. Moving RIGHT moves me closer to (7, 5) and (8, 4) but keeps me at y=1, near the bottom wall. Moving LEFT puts me in a corner. DOWN is towards the wall.\n3.  **Strategy**: UP is the most flexible move. It moves me off the bottom wall and towards the center, keeping options open for (4, 6) if the enemy ignores it, or allowing a path to the right-side apples later. It is equidistant to (4, 6) compared to moving RIGHT, but strictly better for reaching the higher apples at y=9.\n\nPlan: Move UP to get closer to the main playing area.

The opponent (Snake 1) is centered at (6, 6) with 4 apples.\n2.  **Targets:** The apple at (0, 0) is 4 moves away if I continue LEFT. Path: (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0).\n3.  **Opponent Status:** The opponent is close to apples at (4, 6) and (6, 8). Their distance to (0, 0) is 12. They are not a threat to my target.\n4.  **Safety:** Moving LEFT to (3, 0) is perfectly safe. The area (0-3, 0-5) is completely empty. Moving UP to (4, 1) is also safe but increases the distance to the target apple.\n5.  **Plan:** Stick to the previous plan. Secure the apple at (0, 0) which is uncontested. This requires moving LEFT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move LEFT is safe, direct, and optimal for collecting the nearest apple. No other move offers a better reward/risk ratio.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1.  Move LEFT to (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0) to eat the apple.\n2.

Moves adjacent to my body segment at `(1, 0)`.\n    *   **DOWN:** Blocked by body segment `(0, 0)`.\n    *   **LEFT:** Blocked by wall.\n3.  **Strategy:** My immediate goal, as determined in the previous turn, is to move towards the apple at `(5, 2)`. My opponent is currently at `(5, 8)`, which is far away, and they are adjacent to an apple at `(6, 8)`. They will almost certainly take the closer apple, calculating that I am closer to `(5, 2)`.\n4.  **Path Comparison:**\n    *   **Path A (UP):** Move `(0, 2)` then Right. This puts me on row `y=2`. It leaves row `y=1` empty between my path and my body at `y=0`. This is slightly less space-efficient (leaving a 1-wide gap).\n    *   **Path B (RIGHT):** Move `(1, 1)` then Right. This keeps me on row `y=1`. I will be moving parallel to my existing body on row `y=0`. This \"hugs\" my own body, keeping my snake's footprint compact and leaving the larger open space (rows 2-9) available for future maneuvering. It connects smoothly to the target apple `(5, 2)`.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Moving **RIGHT** is the most robust move. It follows standard Snake strategy of hugging walls/bodies to conserve space and moves efficiently toward the objective.\n\n**plan**\n1.  Move **RIGHT** to `(1, 1)`.\n2.  Continue moving **RIGHT** along the `y=1` row towards the apple at `(5, 2)`.\n3.

This path keeps my snake in the central columns (x=5), safely away from the enemy's descent on the right wall, and positions me to easily pivot LEFT towards the empty side of the board afterwards.\n5.  **Safety:** `(5, 3)` is empty. The move is valid and collision-free.\n\n**plan**\n1.  Move **UP** to `(5, 3)`.\n2.  Move **UP** to `(5, 4)` to consume the apple.\n3.  Turn **LEFT** towards `(4, 4)` to retreat into the safe, open space on the left side of the board and aim for the apple at `(1, 1)`.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

After taking this apple, the best long-term plan is to continue up the left edge to the top-left corner to target the apple at `(2, 9)`.\n\n**plan**\nMove **UP** to `(0, 6)` to eat the apple. Then continue moving **UP** along the wall (to `(0, 7)`, `(0, 8)`, `(0, 9)`) before turning right to approach the apple at `(2, 9)`.\n\nUP",

This cell is empty and not occupied by any snake\u2019s body, so it is safe.  \n   - **UP** leads to `(6,9)`. This cell is also empty and safe.  \n   - **RIGHT** leads to `(7,8)`. This cell is empty and not occupied by any snake\u2019s body, so it is safe.\n\n2. **Collision with enemies**  \n   Enemy\u202f#0 can only move **down** to `(2,7)` or **right** to `(3,8)` this turn. None of those destinations intersect with any of our proposed new heads, so all three safe directions avoid a head\u2011on collision.\n\n3. **Proximity to apples**  \n   - Distance to the nearest apple `(9,6)` from the current head `(6,8)` is 5.  \n   - Moving **RIGHT** to `(7,8)` reduces that distance to 4.  \n   - Moving **DOWN** to `(6,7)` also reduces the distance to 4, but it moves us away from the right\u2011hand side of the board where the other apples `(9,5)` and `(9,6)` lie.  \n   - Moving **UP** actually increases the distance to the closest apples, so it is the least desirable.\n\n4. **Future options**  \n   From `(7,8)` we will still have three viable directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) after the move, preserving flexibility. From `(6,7)` moving **down** again would soon run into our own body, limiting options more quickly.\n\n5. **Overall strategy**  \n   - Prioritize moves that keep us alive.  \n   - Among safe moves, choose the one that pushes us toward reachable apples while leaving multiple future directions open.  \n   - **RIGHT** satisfies both: it is safe, brings us closer to the cluster of apples on the right side, and maintains flexibility for subsequent turns.\n\n**Decision:** MOVE RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

The neighbor `(0, 5)` is my tail; since I will grow, the tail segment at `(0, 5)` will remain for this turn, but `(1, 4)` and `(2, 5)` are valid escape routes, so I won't be trapped.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to empty space but delays eating the apple. It offers no significant strategic advantage over moving DOWN.\n\nThe opponent (Snake #1) is at `(8, 7)`, far away on the right side of the board and surrounded by its own body, making it impossible for it to contest the apple at `(1, 5)` or cut me off on the left side anytime soon.\n\n**strategy**\nMove **DOWN** to eat the apple at `(1, 5)`.

Since I am behind in score (11 vs 17), I must prioritize the contested apples `(4, 3)` and `(5, 1)`.

Moving **UP** to `(4, 4)` leads into a dead-end formed by the enemy body at `(4, 5)` and `(5, 4)`. Moving **RIGHT** to `(5, 3)` places me adjacent to the enemy's future tail-end blocks and brings me closer to the enemy head, which is risky. **DOWN** is the safest move, leading to the open bottom area.\n2.  **Opportunity**: From `(4, 2)`, I have a clear path to the apple at `(5, 1)` (via `(5, 2)` or `(4, 1)`) and subsequently `(2, 1)`. The enemy is currently at `(8, 3)` and likely targeting the apple at `(7, 2)`. By moving downwards, I can secure the bottom apples uncontested.\n3.  **Enemy Interaction**: Moving to `(4, 2)` keeps my y-coordinate (2) distinct from the enemy's likely path (y=3 or y=2 further east), minimizing head-on collision risks.\n\n**strategy**\nExecute the pivot to the bottom rows.

If the enemy moves LEFT from `(7, 2)` (though less likely than UP), we collide head-on and I lose (fewer apples). Even if they go UP, I end up adjacent to them with less space.\n*   **DOWN**: Moving to `(5, 1)` allows me to immediately collect an apple (guaranteed point). The area below (rows 0 and 1) is open.

From there, traverse the bottom open area leftwards to collect the apple at `(2, 1)`, then use the empty left column (x=0) to move UP towards the apple at `(0, 7)`. This keeps me far away from the larger enemy snake currently occupying the upper right quadrant.\n\n**plan**\nNext moves: LEFT to (4, 1), then proceed to (2, 1) for the apple. Afterward, navigate via (1, 1) and (0, 1) to the left column (x=0) and head UP for the apple at (0, 7). Watch out for new spawns.\n\nDOWN",

This is completely safe. The subsequent plan would be to move to (0, 1) and then travel UP along the empty `x=0` column. This path targets two apples at (0, 7) and (0, 9).\n    *   **Pros**: This path is protected by my own body segments at `x=1` (specifically (1, 3) through (1, 7)), creating a wall between me and the enemy. It secures a safe corridor to collect multiple apples.\n    *   **Enemy**: The enemy is at (5, 4) and is highly likely to move LEFT to (4, 4) to consume an apple. The enemy is blocked from moving DOWN by my body at (4, 3) and (5, 2), effectively isolating them in the upper/right portion of the board while I secure the bottom-left.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 0)**: Moving DOWN allows travel along the bottom edge. I could head right towards the apple at (6, 0) or left towards `x=0`.\n    *   **Comparison**: Heading to (6, 0) puts me closer to the enemy's potential territory and only yields 1 apple immediately. Heading left via (1, 0) takes 1 turn longer to reach the top-left apples compared to the (1, 1) path.\n3.  **UP (2, 2)**: This leads into the center of my own coil. While safe immediately, it offers less freedom than the `x=0` highway.\n\n**Conclusion**: The move to (1, 1) is the most efficient entry point to the safe and apple-rich `x=0` column. The enemy is too far away to pose an immediate threat, and my body wall provides excellent passive defense.\n\n**Plan**: Move LEFT to (1, 1), then continue LEFT to (0, 1), then move UP along the left wall to collect apples at (0, 7) and (0, 9).\n\nLEFT",

From here, I can travel RIGHT along the bottom edge (row 0) to collect apples at (6, 0) and (8, 0). This path is extremely safe.

This segment will move away in roughly 6 turns. I will reach (9,5) in about 12 turns. Therefore, the path up column 9 will be completely safe.\n\n**Plan**:\n1.  Move RIGHT to (3, 0).\n2.  Continue RIGHT to collect apples at (6, 0) and (8, 0).\n3.  Do not turn UP until reaching the corner at (9, 0) to ensure the vertical path is clear of the enemy.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

While column 9 is currently partially blocked by the enemy's body at (9, 5), the enemy moves before I reach that spot. Calculations confirm the blockage will clear (around turn 81) well before I arrive (around turn 84), creating a safe corridor to the upper board and the apple at (6, 9).\n\n**Rationale:**\nI am currently at (6, 0).\n-   **Safety:** The enemy snake (Head at 0, 8) is far away in the top-left quadrant and cannot reach me. The local area is safe from head-on collisions.\n-   **Objectives:** The apple at (8, 0) is 2 moves away via the RIGHT path. Although UP (6, 1) is a valid move, it is slower to the apple and moves me closer to the enemy's static body wall, restricting movement.\n-   **Escape Route:** My body partially blocks the left side of this area, and the enemy blocks the top. The only reliable escape from this bottom section is up the right edge (column 9). Moving RIGHT aligns me perfectly with this exit strategy.\n\nRIGHT",

Column 9 is the only viable escape route to the upper board. The enemy tail currently blocking (9, 5) will vacate that spot (around turn 82) well before I arrive (around turn 85), ensuring a clear path.\n\n**Rationale:**\nI am at (7, 0).\n-   **Survival:** UP to (7, 1) leads into a cramped area with dead ends at (6, 1) and (8, 1), bounded by my body and the enemy's static body segments. LEFT is my body. DOWN is a wall. RIGHT is the only move that maintains multiple future options.\n-   **Objectives:** The apple at (8, 0) is immediately adjacent. Taking it gives me a point and positions me perfectly to access the rightmost column (column 9).\n-   **Enemy Analysis:** The enemy (Head 0,9) is far away in the top-left. Its body forms a barrier in the middle-right (cols 6-8), but the tail segments blocking my path up column 9 are receding. Calculations show the blockage at (9, 5) will clear by Turn 82, and I will arrive there Turn 85, making the ascent safe.\n\nRIGHT",

Although currently blocked by the enemy's tail at (9, 5) and (9, 6), these segments will vacate cleanly turn-by-turn as the enemy moves, clearing the path before my head arrives.\n3.  **Collision Avoidance:** Calculate the collision timing. The enemy head (at 2, 9) moving towards the apple (at 6, 9) and then the top-right corner (9, 9) will arrive at the choke point (9, 8) on Turn 88. My snake would also arrive at (9, 8) on Turn 88. To prevent a fatal head-on collision (which I would lose due to lower score), I will exit the column early by turning LEFT into row 6, 7, or 8, depending on the enemy's exact movements.\n\n**Rationale:**\nMoving UP to (9, 1) is the only move that keeps me alive this turn. DOWN and RIGHT allow no movement (walls), and LEFT leads directly into my own body (segment at 8, 0). The move positions me to exploit the clearing provided by the enemy's tail in column 9, offering the safest route out of the bottom-right corner.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

This move is safer than UP, which places the head adjacent to the enemy body wall with only one exit.\n2.  **Corridor Navigation:** Continue West along row 1 (5, 1 -> 4, 1 -> 3, 1). This corridor is currently clear and provides access to the western apples.\n3.  **Apple Harvest:** Target the apple at (2, 2). By the time I approach x=2, my tail at (2, 1) will have moved, clearing the path to turn upwards towards (2, 2) or continue to the apple at (0, 3).\n4.  **Strategic Overview:** The enemy snake is congested in the top half of the board (y > 3). The bottom rows (0-3) are a safe zone to freely collect the 3 lower-left apples before challenging the upper section.\n\n**Rationale:**\nFrom (6, 1), the valid moves are LEFT and UP. Moving UP to (6, 2) is suboptimal because the enemy body at (7, 2) and (6, 3) creates a corner, forcing the next move to be West anyway while reducing escape options. Moving LEFT to (5, 1) grants immediate access to two open neighbors ((4, 1) and (5, 2)), maximizing flexibility while maintaining the most direct path to the target apples in the bottom-left quadrant. The enemy head is distant (6, 9) and poses no immediate threat.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

It secures a point and positions the head to enter the \"left corridor\" (columns 0 and 1) from the bottom. The enemy snake's body creates a solid wall at y=7 (x=0,1) and x=2 (y=4..7), turning the top-left area into a cul-de-sac.

The enemy snake (ID 1) is operating in the upper-right quadrant and is blocked from entering the bottom-left area (where I am) by its own body wall along x=2 (from y=4 to y=7) and y=4. This creates a protected pocket for me to safely collect the apples at (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), and (1, 6).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Move LEFT to (1, 2):** This aligns the head with column 1 to begin a systematic sweep.\n2.  **Execute Loop Pattern (Up Col 1, Down Col 0):** This is the most efficient way to clear the dead-end while maintaining safety. The path is:\n    *   **Up:** (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 5) [Apple] -> (1, 6) [Apple].\n    *   **Turn:** (1, 6) -> (0, 6).\n    *   **Down:** (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) [Apple] -> (0, 3) [Apple] -> (0, 2).\n3.  **Exit Strategy:** After reaching (0, 2), exit via (0, 1) to (1, 1). By that time, my tail (currently at 1,0) will have moved forward significantly, clearing the path along y=0 to escape to the right side of the board.\n\n**Rationale:**\nMoving LEFT is the optimal start for this pattern. It places the body into the \"interior\" of the pocket (column 1), leaving the outer edge (column 2) and the gap at (2, 3) available as a buffer or potential alternative path later, although unnecessary. The enemy cannot reach (1, 2) or interfere with this sequence due to the physical barriers of its own body. This move secures clean access to 4 uncontested apples.\n\nLEFT",

It is surrounded by my body segments at (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 1), none of which will move for many turns. Entering (1, 1) traps me with no escape.\n    *   **DOWN (1, -1):** Wall.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 0):** My own body (neck). Instant death.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 0):** Empty. This path leads down a corridor along row y=0.\n3.  **Tunnel Dynamics:**\n    *   The corridor at y=0 is bounded above by my body segments at y=1 (specifically (2,1) through (9,1)).\n    *   These segments are near my tail. The tail is at (9,1). As I move, these segments will vacate sequentially from right to left (9,1 then 8,1 then 7,1...).\n    *   I can safely travel RIGHT to collect the apple at (3, 0).\n4.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   After collecting the apple at (3,0), I should continue moving RIGHT.\n    *   Enemy Snake 1 is at (9,6) and is likely to come down column 9 or column 8 to get the apples at (7,4), (7,3), and (7,2). This puts the rightmost part of the board (x=7,8,9) in a contested or blocked state.\n    *   Calculations show that the ceiling of my tunnel at y=1 will clear locally at x=6 by Turn 106 (my T+4 move puts me at (6,0), and simultaneously (6,1) clears).\n    *   Therefore, the safest strategy is to go to (6,0), then turn UP to (6,1), and then loop back LEFT towards x=0. This utilizes the space my tail is leaving behind and keeps me away from the enemy snake on the right.\n\n**Immediate Move:**\nThe only safe and constructive move is RIGHT.\n\n**plan**\nI will move RIGHT to (2,0) and continue to (3,0) to eat the apple. I cannot go UP (trap) or LEFT (death). I will continue RIGHT along the bottom row (y=0) while my tail segments at y=1 recede. I calculate that the segment at (6,1) will vacate just in time for me to move UP from (6,0) to (6,1) around turn T+5. This allows me to perform a \"hook\" turn: go deep into the tunnel, turn UP, then turn LEFT to loop back into the space vacated by my body, avoiding the dangerous confrontation with Snake 1 near the apples at x=7 and x=8.\n**final move**\nRIGHT",

(2, -1) is off-board. **RIGHT (3, 0)** is the only legal move.\n2.  **Objective:** The move to (3, 0) collects an apple.\n3.  **Future Geometry:** My body segments at y=1 will vacate sequentially from right to left (tail is at 8,1). The tunnel \"ceiling\" at (6, 1) is calculated to open at the end of Turn 106 (after 3 more steps from (3,0)). This perfectly aligns with my arrival at (6, 0).\n4.  **Strategy:** I will proceed RIGHT to (6, 0). Then, I will turn UP to (6, 1) and immediately hook LEFT to (5, 1), looping back into the safe space vacated by my tail. This path avoids the dead-end at x=9 and keeps me away from Enemy 1, who is descending column 9/8 to eat apples in column 7.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Move:** RIGHT is mandatory to survive.\n*   **Enemy:** Enemy 1 is at (9, 5) and will likely target apples at (7, 4), (7, 3), keeping them occupied in columns 7-9 while I execute my turn at column 6.\n\n**plan**\nMove RIGHT to (3,0) to eat. Continue RIGHT to (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). At (6,0), turn UP to (6,1) (which will be empty then) and turn LEFT to (5,1) to loop back west, avoiding the enemy snake on the east side.\n**final move**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

It also keeps the spacious right\u2011hand side of the board open for future maneuvers, preserving multiple viable directions. DOWN offers no immediate gain and moves us away from the nearest apple, while still leaving us with fewer open options. Therefore LEFT best satisfies the goal of scoring while maintaining flexibility.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to eat the (7,4) apple, then evaluate next turn for moving toward (7,3) or other reachable apples, always checking for collisions with our body and the opponent.\n\nLEFT",

I will turn UP to (6, 1), then turn LEFT to traverse back along row y=1 (5, 1 -> 4, 1 -> ...), effectively chasing the empty space left by my receding tail.\n4.
