This moves me away from most apples.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (1, 1):**\n    *   Distance to (2, 2) apple: Manhattan distance = 2.\n    *   This also moves me towards the center.\n\n**3. Analyze threat from Snake #1:**\nSnake #1 is at (0, 7). It is far away and currently poses no immediate collision threat.\n\n**4. Comparing UP and RIGHT:**\n\nBoth UP to (0, 2) and RIGHT to (1, 1) bring the snake closer to the apple at (2, 2) (distance 2).\n\n*   If I move UP to (0, 2):\n    *   Next turn: I can move RIGHT to (1, 2) (distance 1 to (2, 2), 2 to (3, 3)) or UP to (0, 3).\n*   If I move RIGHT to (1, 1):\n    *   Next turn: I can move UP to (1, 2) (distance 1 to (2, 2), 3 to (3, 3)) or RIGHT to (2, 1).\n\nMoving UP to (0, 2) generally keeps my path closer to apples (2, 2) and (3, 3) while staying along the left edge, which might be slightly safer initially as the opponent is also on the left edge higher up. (0, 2) is 2 units away from (2, 2). (1, 1) is 2 units away from (2, 2).\n\nLet's look at moves towards (2, 2):\nIf I choose UP (0, 2): In T=1, I can move RIGHT to (1, 2), then in T=2, RIGHT to (2, 2) to eat the apple.\nIf I choose RIGHT (1, 1): In T=1, I can move UP to (1, 2), then in T=2, RIGHT to (2, 2) to eat the apple.\n\nBoth lead to eating the apple at (2, 2) in 2 turns if the path is clear.\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 2), I am also slightly better positioned to move towards (3, 3) later if (2, 2) becomes contested or if I want to alternate targets.\n\nGiven the starting positions, both UP and RIGHT are excellent choices. I'll choose UP as it gives better vertical spacing from the bottom boundary early on.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Target the apple at (2, 2) first, followed by (3, 3). Snake 1 is currently positioned to potentially go for (2, 7) or (1, 9).\n\nUP",

Analyze safe moves and proximity to apples:**\n\nThe closest apple is A at (3, 3) (Manhattan distance: |3-2| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 2):** Distance to (3, 3) is 0 + 1 = 1. Moves along the x-axis towards the apple's x-coordinate. Excellent.\n*   **Move UP to (2, 3):** Distance to (3, 3) is 1 + 0 = 1. Moves along the y-axis towards the apple's y-coordinate. Excellent.\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 1):** Distance to (3, 3) is 1 + 2 = 3. Moves away from the apple.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT move me closer to (3, 3) and minimize distance to 1. Since (3, 3) is diagonally up-right from (2, 2), either move is a good progression.\n\n**3. Analyze Head-on Collision Risk:**\n\nMy potential next positions are (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2).\nEnemy Snake 1 head is at (2, 8), Body at (2, 7).\nPossible safe moves for Snake 1: (2, 9) [UP - Apple at (1, 9) is close], (3, 8) [RIGHT], (1, 8) [LEFT], (2, 7) [DOWN - into body, dead]. (Wait, since E1 is at (2, 8) and body is (2, 7), DOWN into (2, 7) is hitting its own body/tail, which is fatal.)\n*E1 safe moves: (2, 9), (3, 8), (1, 8).*\n\nNone of E1's safe moves conflict with my safe moves (2, 3), (2, 1), or (3, 2).\n\n**4. Optimal move selection (UP vs RIGHT):**\n\nBoth UP to (2, 3) and RIGHT to (3, 2) set me up well for the apple at (3, 3) on Turn 4.\n\n*   If I move RIGHT to (3, 2), the snake will be (3, 2), body (2, 2). Next move UP to (3, 3) for the apple.\n*   If I move UP to (2, 3), the snake will be (2, 3), body (2, 2). Next move RIGHT to (3, 3) for the apple.\n\nLet's look ahead one more step.\nIf I choose RIGHT (to (3, 2)):\nNext turn (T4) I will be at (3, 2). My moves are (4, 2) [R], (3, 3) [U - Apple], (3, 1) [D], (2, 2) [L - Body]. Only 3 safe moves.\n\nIf I choose UP (to (2, 3)):\nNext turn (T4) I will be at (2, 3). My moves are (3, 3) [R - Apple], (2, 4) [U], (2, 2) [D - Body], (1, 3) [L]. Only 3 safe moves.\n\nBoth paths lead to (3, 3) safely on T4. I will pick the move that keeps me more central for future apples if possible, although here it makes little difference. (5, 6) is the next closest apple after (3, 3). Moving RIGHT slightly brings me closer to the center of the board.\n\nLet's choose **RIGHT** towards (3, 2) to cover the x-distance first.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nThe plan is to collect (3, 3) on Turn 4 (move UP). After (3, 3), the snake will be 3 blocks long. The remaining apples are high: (1, 9), (9, 9), (5, 6), (7, 5). The next target should be (5, 6) or (7, 5) depending on enemy movement. E1 is currently active in the top area ((2, 8)). I should try to move towards the center (east) to avoid conflict and grab (5, 6) and/or (7, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

Snake 1 is likely to target (9, 9) (MD 8) or perhaps (0, 2) (MD 7), but moving towards (9, 9) seems the most competitive direction.\n\nPossible E1 moves from (1, 9):\n*   UP: (1, 10) -> DEAD (Out of bounds)\n*   DOWN: (1, 8) -> FATAL (Into its own body segment 1)\n*   LEFT: (0, 9) -> Safe\n*   RIGHT: (2, 9) -> Safe\n\nE1 is trapped by its own body except for LEFT and RIGHT. If E1 moves to (2, 9), it enters the upper half of the board. My moves (3, 4) or (4, 3) are not in immediate conflict.\n\n**4. Optimal move selection (UP vs RIGHT):**\n\nWe want to reach (5, 6).\n*   If I choose **UP to (3, 4)**: Next turn optimal move would be RIGHT to (4, 4) (MD 1+2=3) or RIGHT/UP to (4, 5) (MD 1+1=2).\n*   If I choose **RIGHT to (4, 3)**: Next turn optimal move would be UP to (4, 4) (MD 1+2=3) or UP to (5, 3) (MD 0+3=3).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 3) immediately puts me into the '4' column, which aligns better for reaching '5' (the X magnitude for the apple). (4, 3) is 1 unit from 5 in X, 3 units from 6 in Y.\n(3, 4) is 2 units from 5 in X, 2 units from 6 in Y.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems slightly more forward-looking, setting me up for U/R moves to climb the board while increasing the X coordinate quickly.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (4, 3): Next moves could be: U to (4, 4), R to (5, 3), U/R to (5, 4).\nIf I choose UP (3, 4): Next moves could be: R to (4, 4), R/U to (4, 5).\n\nSince $x=5$ for the target apple (5, 6) is closer than $y=6$, prioritizing the X coordinate advancement seems slightly beneficial.\n\nChoosing RIGHT to (4, 3).\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (for Turn 6):**\nI will be at (4, 3). Target is (5, 6).\nThe path should involve moving RIGHT one more time (R to 5, 3) or UP/RIGHT (U to 4, 4, then R to 5, 4).\nIf I move R to (4, 3) this turn, next turn I have safe moves UP (4, 4), RIGHT (5, 3), DOWN (4, 2), LEFT (3, 3) (into tail).\nTarget (5, 6) is reachable via UP or RIGHT. If I move RIGHT next turn to (5, 3), I am 3 steps away (0 + 3).

Check immediate deadly moves for Snake 0 (Head at (4, 3)):**\n\n*   Board boundaries: 0-9 for X and Y.\n*   My body: (3, 3), (3, 2).\n*   Snake 1 body: (1, 9), (1, 8).\n*   Snake 1 head: (2, 9).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision/Out of Bounds Check | Status |\n| :--- | :----------- | :---------------------------- | :----- |\n| UP   | (4, 4)       | Safe                          | Safe |\n| DOWN | (4, 2)       | Safe                          | Safe |\n| LEFT | (3, 3)       | Fatal - Moves into own body (segment 1) | DEAD |\n| RIGHT| (5, 3)       | Safe                          | Safe |\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze safe moves and proximity to apples:**\n\nThe closest apples remain (5, 6) and (7, 5).\n\n*   Target 1: (5, 6). MD from (4, 3) = |5-4| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n*   Target 2: (7, 5). MD from (4, 3) = |7-4| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nWe prioritize moving towards (5, 6).\n\n*   **Move UP to (4, 4):** MD to (5, 6) reduces to |5-4| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3. Good.\n*   **Move DOWN to (4, 2):** MD to (5, 6) increases to |5-4| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5. Bad.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (5, 3):** MD to (5, 6) reduces to |5-5| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3. Good.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT reduce the distance to (5, 6) to 3. We need to decide which trajectory is better.\n\n**3. Evaluate opponent proximity and threat (Snake 1 at (2, 9)):**\n\nSnake 1 is at (2, 9). Snake 1 has two safe moves:\n1. LEFT to (1, 9): Fatal (Into own body: segment 1). **Wait, let's re-examine E1's body.** E1 Head: (2, 9), Body: [(1, 9), (1, 8)].\n   * DOWN: (2, 8). Safe.\n   * LEFT: (1, 9). Fatal (Into segment 1).\n   * RIGHT: (3, 9). Safe.\n   * UP: (2, 10). Dead (Out of bounds).\nSafe E1 moves: DOWN to (2, 8) or RIGHT to (3, 9).\n\nIf E1 moves RIGHT to (3, 9), it might be targeting (9, 9) (MD 6) or (5, 6) (MD 7).\nIf E1 moves DOWN to (2, 8), it might be targeting (5, 6) (MD 5) or (0, 2) (MD 6).\n\nIf E1 goes DOWN (2, 8), it is 5 steps away from (5, 6).\nI am 3 steps away from (5, 6). I maintain a lead towards this apple. Since E1 is likely targeting (5, 6), I must prioritize reaching it first.\n\n**4. Optimal move selection (UP vs RIGHT):**\n\n*   If I choose **UP to (4, 4):** I am on Y=4. Next move options: R to (5, 4) (MD 1+2=3, wrong, MD 0+2=2) or U to (4, 5) (MD 1+1=2).\n    * (4, 4) -> (5, 4) targets X=5 first. MD to (5, 6) is 2.\n    * (4, 4) -> (4, 5) targets Y=6 first. MD to (5, 6) is 2.\n*   If I choose **RIGHT to (5, 3):** I have captured the X coordinate correctly. I am on X=5. Next move options: U to (5, 4) (MD 0+2=2).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 3) seems slightly more direct because it immediately aligns the X coordinate with the apple (5, 6). From (5, 3), I only need UP moves.\nR to (5, 3) -> U to (5, 4) -> U to (5, 5) -> U to (5, 6). Total 3 moves. (Turns 6, 7, 8, 9). Wait, 3 moves only takes 3 turns: T6 (5, 3); T7 (5, 4); T8 (5, 5); T9 (5, 6). I eat the apple on T9.\n\nIf I choose UP to (4, 4):\nU to (4, 4) -> R to (5, 4) -> U to (5, 5) -> U to (5, 6). Total 3 moves. (Turns 6, 7, 8, 9). I eat the apple on T9.\n\nBoth paths take 3 further turns (until T9) to reach (5, 6) and are equally optimal in terms of distance.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT to (5, 3) keeps me further away from the center of the board momentarily if E1 were to try cutting me off from the left. E1 is also positioned on the far top side.\n\nLet's check the alternative target (7, 5).\n(5, 3) to (7, 5): MD = 2 + 2 = 4.\n(4, 4) to (7, 5): MD = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nSince both primary target paths are equally short (3 moves), let's prioritize the direction that opens up the most freedom or prepares best for subsequent moves.\n(5, 3) is close to the vertical line (X=5) that leads straight to (5, 6).\n(4, 4) is centrally located.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 3), my body structure becomes (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2). If I continue UP, the body will trace a path along X=4 and X=5.\n\nIf E1 moves DOWN to (2, 8). MD is reduced to 3 for (5, 6) if E1 moves R, R, D to (4, 7) or (5, 6) is not reachable in 3 moves from (2, 8).\n(2, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> 4 moves (T10). If E1 moves diagonally (R, R, D, D), that is faster. R to (3, 8), R to (4, 8), D to (4, 7), D to (4, 6), R/D.\nMD from (2, 8) to (5, 6) is 3 + 2 = 5.\nIf E1 moves R, D, R, D, R: T7 (3, 8), T8 (3, 7), T9 (4, 7), T10 (4, 6), T11 (5, 6). If E1 commits to (5, 6), I win the race by two turns (T9).\n\nTherefore, I have time regardless of whether I choose UP or RIGHT. I will choose **RIGHT** as it secures the X coordinate alignment immediately and aligns me slightly further away from any conflict zone with E1 moving down the board.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (for Turn 7):**\nI will be at (5, 3). Target is (5, 6). Next move should be UP to (5, 4). This move is guaranteed safe unless E1 somehow manages to block (5, 4) or (5, 3) unexpectedly (which is geometrically highly unlikely).\n\nRIGHT",

Analyze safe moves and proximity to apples:**\n\nThe closest apple is (5, 6) (MD 3). We secured X=5. We need to increase Y.\n\n*   Target 1: (5, 6).\n*   **Move UP to (5, 4):** This is the optimal path. MD to (5, 6) reduces to 2.\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 2):** MD to (5, 6) increases to 4. Bad.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 3):** MD to (5, 6) increases to |5-6| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4. Bad.\n\nThe optimal move is clearly UP towards (5, 6).\n\n**3. Evaluate opponent movement and conflict potential:**\n\nSnake 1 is at (3, 9). The adjacent cells are (2, 9), (4, 9), (3, 8), (3, 10 - out of bounds).\nE1 body: (2, 9), (1, 9).\nE1 safe moves:\n*   RIGHT to (4, 9). (Targets (9, 9) - MD 5, or perhaps looking down the middle.)\n*   DOWN to (3, 8). (Targets (5, 6) - MD 4, or (7, 5) - MD 7.)\n\nIf E1 moves RIGHT to (4, 9), it continues towards (9, 9) or the far right side.\nIf E1 moves DOWN to (3, 8), it starts descending towards the center apples (5, 6) or (7, 5).\n\nSince I am at (5, 3) and moving UP to (5, 4), I am already committed to X=5.\nIf E1 moves DOWN to (3, 8), the distance to (5, 6) is 5.\nIf E1 moves RIGHT to (4, 9), the distance to (5, 6) is 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nIn all realistic scenarios, I maintain a significant lead to (5, 6). My move UP to (5, 4) is perfectly safe and necessary for the shortest path. There is no threat of a collision with Snake 1 as we are far apart.\n\n**Conclusion:** The move UP is the only move that reduces the distance to the target apple (5, 6) along the chosen optimal trajectory (X=5).\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (for Turn 8):**\nI will be at (5, 4). Target remains (5, 6). Next move should be UP to (5, 5).\n\nUP",
