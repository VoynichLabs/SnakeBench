Where is the content? Where is the strategy?\n\nOkay, let's analyze the board, Turn 0.\n\n**Our Position (ID 0):** (2, 8). We are up high in the top-left quadrant.\n**Rival's Position (ID 1):** (5, 2). They are down low, centralized.\n\n**Apples:**\nThe closest apples to us are:\n1. (5, 8) - wait, that's not an apple, Chat, check the board state! (3, 7) is an apple! (4, 8) is an apple!\n2. (4, 8) - diagonal, 3 moves away (right, up, right/left or right, right, up?) Wait, we are at (2, 8). (4, 8) is 2 moves right. EZ.\n3. (3, 7) - diagonal, 2 moves away (down, right OR right, down).\n\nThe closest apples to the rival (5, 2):\n1. (5, 1) - 1 move down. SUPER close!\n2. (4, 8) - no, too far.\n3. (7, 0) - far.\n4. (8, 2) - 3 moves right.\n\nRival is looking like they are going straight for (5, 1) or maybe (5, 0) which is slightly further. If they go DOWN, they hit (5, 1) and score first. We gotta move faster, Chat! \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udca8\n\n**OUR IMMEDIATE THREATS & OPTIONS (at (2, 8)):**\n\n1.  **UP (2, 9):** Safe. Keeps us alive. Puts us on the top edge. Good for accessing the top-right later.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 7):** Safe. Moves towards (3, 7) and (4, 8). This looks promising!\n3.  **LEFT (1, 8):** Safe. Moves us further away from the current apple cluster. Not ideal unless we want to hide.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 8):** Safe. Moves us closer to (4, 8). This is also a strong contender.\n\n**STRATEGY ANALYSIS:**\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (3, 8), we are 1 step closer to (4, 8).\nIf we go DOWN to (2, 7), we are 1 step closer to (3, 7) and still close to (4, 8).\n\nLet's see what the rival might do (at (5, 2)):\n*   **DOWN (5, 1):** EATS the apple instantly. This is their optimal move for scoring quickly.\n*   **LEFT (4, 2):** Safer, but moves away from the nearest food.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 2):** Safer, but moves away from the nearest food.\n*   **UP (5, 3):** Moves away from the apple.\n\nWe must assume the rival will go DOWN and grab that apple at (5, 1). We need to secure *our* food supply and then look for the collision later.\n\nThe path to (4, 8) is two steps right.\nThe path to (3, 7) is one step right and one step down.\n\nIf we go RIGHT (to 3, 8):\nNext turn, we can go RIGHT again to (4, 8) and grab the apple! That's two turns to get an apple. We can stomach the rival getting the first one if we secure the second instantly. This keeps us on the high ground!\n\nIf we go DOWN (to 2, 7):\nNext turn, we can go RIGHT to (3, 7) and grab that apple! That's also two turns to get an apple. This puts us slightly lower and closer to the center, which might increase early engagement risk.\n\nLet's look at the tie-breaker: Future options and center control.\n\nMoving RIGHT (3, 8) keeps us high and dry. If we secure (4, 8), our next move gives us options (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT again).\n\nIf we move DOWN (2, 7) and grab (3, 7), we're now at (3, 7) and closer to the rival's growing body.\n\nI like the high ground, Chat! We secure the (4, 8) apple and keep maximum distance from Snake 1 while it grows downwards. Let's position for that (4, 8) apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**PLANNED SHORT-TERM STRATEGY (2 turns):**\nTurn 0: RIGHT (to 3, 8)\nTurn 1: RIGHT (to 4, 8) -> EAT APPLE\nThis is a guaranteed apple, assuming no sudden shift from the opponent towards our area. The opponent is likely going DOWN to (5, 1).\n\nLet's go for the RIGHT move! Secure the content! EZ CLAP!\n\nRIGHT",

We gotta start STRONG and set the tempo! \ud83d\udca5\n\nFirst, the IMMEDIATE SCAN:\n\n*   **UP to (5,3):** Looks clear! No snakes, no walls. Solid.\n*   **DOWN to (5,1):** APPLE ALERT! \ud83c\udf4e That's a juicy bite right there! It's safe, no immediate threats.\n*   **LEFT to (4,2):** Also clear. Opens up the left side of the board.\n*   **RIGHT to (6,2):** Wide open. Heads towards more apples in the future.\n\nALL MOVES ARE SAFE. NOBODY IS NEAR US. This is our chance to get fed!\n\nBut wait... the LONG GAME. \ud83e\udd14 The enemy is way up there. We need to control the flow. If we grab this apple below us, we grow immediately. A bigger snake is a scarier snake! But does it box us in? Let's think about follow-up moves from each spot.\n\n**DOWN (5,1)** gets the apple. Then next turn, from (5,1), we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (back to (5,2)). Still good options! We're not trapped.\n\n**UP (5,3)** keeps us small but gets us to the center, maybe setting up for that apple at (5,5).\n\nChat, the play is obvious, right? WE TAKE THE FREE CONTENT! \ud83d\udc51 Get big early, establish dominance. The enemy isn't a threat yet, so let's build our health bar!\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** Secure the apple below to grow to 2 segments. Immediately look to control the center or head towards the cluster near (0,3)/(0,1). Stay aware of the opponent's potential downward path.\n\nHERE WE GO! TIME TO FEAST!\n\nDOWN",

We moved RIGHT to (3, 8), and the rival, as predicted, went DOWN and slurped that first apple at (5, 1)! One point for them, zero for us, but we are positioned perfectly for our content grab! LET'S GO!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at (3, 8). We are a tiny one-segment snake.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5, 1). Body is now [(5, 2)]. They just GREW! They are 2 segments long and sitting low.\n*   **Target Apple:** (4, 8). This is EXACTLY one move away, RIGHT!\n\n**The Plan VOD Review (Turn 0 VOD Plan):**\n1. Turn 0: RIGHT (Done, now at (3, 8))\n2. Turn 1: RIGHT (to 4, 8) -> EAT APPLE\nThis plan is still absolutely GIGA-CHAD and we are executing!\n\n**Safety Check (From (3, 8)):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 9):** Safe. Keeps us alive. Moves away from the apple. NO.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 7):** Safe. Moves toward the (3, 7) apple. But (4, 8) is closer! If we go down, we miss out on the guaranteed apple right now. NO.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 8):** Safe. Moves us back where we started. Trailing. NO.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 8):** **EATS THE APPLE!** Safe from the walls. Is it safe from Snake 1?\n\n**Rival's Predicted Move (Snake 1 at (5, 1), Body at (5, 2)):**\n\nSnake 1 just ate an apple and is likely looking for the next one.\n*   Next closest cluster is down low: (5, 0), (7, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2).\n*   Options for Snake 1:\n    *   **DOWN (5, 0):** INSTANT APPLE. This is the most likely move. They grab another apple and push further down the edge.\n    *   **LEFT (4, 1) or RIGHT (6, 1):** Safe, but moves away from immediate food. Less likely.\n    *   **UP (5, 2):** They would run directly into their own body segment (5, 2)! **INSTANT DEATH!** Snake 1 is not that dumb, Chat.\n\n**Collision Check: Us moving RIGHT to (4, 8).**\n\nOur target (4, 8) is way up high. Snake 1 is way down at (5, 1). There is absolutely no way Snake 1 can reach (4, 8) this turn, or even get close enough to collide with us. We are safe!\n\n**Execution:**\nWe move RIGHT to (4, 8). We eat the apple. We grow to 2 segments (Head: 4, 8). Snake 1 likely moves DOWN to (5, 0) and grows to 3 segments. We minimize their score advantage quickly and maintain the high ground!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (Future Turns):**\nIf we move RIGHT, we are at (4, 8) and Snake 1 is at (5, 0).\nNext turn (T2), we will look towards (3, 7) (down, left) or continue RIGHT towards the right wall. We need to watch Snake 1 as they start building a wall along the bottom or turn back up. Priority is stacking 2-3 apples quickly before engaging.\n\nThis is a smooth execution, Chat!

Okay, okay...\n*   **LEFT to (4,1):** Empty space! Looks clear.\n*   **RIGHT to (6,1):** Also empty! Good to go.\n\nSo our SAFE moves are **DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT**.\n\nNow, STRATEGY TIME! That apple at (5,0) is RIGHT THERE. It's a free meal! But let's think one step ahead like the genius we are. \ud83e\udd13 If we go DOWN and eat it:\n\n1.  Our head moves to (5,0), eats the apple.\n2.  Our tail... wait, how does growth work? Our head moves to the apple, our body follows, so our new head is at (5,0), our old head (5,1) becomes body, and our tail (5,2) stays put because we grew! So our snake becomes THREE LONG! [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2)].\n3.  BUT NEXT TURN from (5,0)... what are our moves? UP is back to (5,1) which is our body. So that's suicide. LEFT to (4,0) or RIGHT to (6,0). ONLY TWO OPTIONS. That's a potential TRAP! \ud83d\ude2c We'd be pinned against the bottom wall with limited escapes.\n\n**VS. GOING LEFT or RIGHT:**\nIf we go LEFT to (4,1) or RIGHT to (6,1), we STAY AT 2 SEGMENTS but we have MORE FREEDOM. From (4,1), we can go UP, DOWN, LEFT. From (6,1), we can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT. WAY MORE OPTIONS.\n\nThe enemy Snake #0 is way up at (3,8). They're probably heading for that apple at (3,7) or (5,5). They aren't a threat RIGHT NOW. So this is about BOARD CONTROL. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nCHAT, THE PLAY IS CLEAR! We don't take the bait! We play for LONG-TERM DOMINANCE! We avoid the potential trap at the bottom and keep our movement options WIDE OPEN.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:** Let's move AWAY from the bottom wall, maybe start curving upwards towards the center and that cluster of apples on the left side (like (1,4), (0,3)). Staying mobile and flexible is key to boxing in the enemy later!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! We're at Turn 2, and the VOD review of the last turn was **perfect**! We executed the plan flawlessly!\n\nWe moved RIGHT to (4, 8) and snagged that apple! We are now a 2-segment monster! Our snake is at $$(4, 8) \\rightarrow (3, 8)$$. LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4f\n\nNow, what did the rival do? Snake #1 was at (5, 1) and they went **DOWN** to (5, 0) and grabbed their second apple! As predicted! They are now $$(5, 0) \\rightarrow (5, 1) \\rightarrow (5, 2)$$. They are 3 segments long. **Chat, they are currently beating us by one segment, but two snakes are better than one!**\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 2):\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at (4, 8). Body: [(3, 8)]. Length: 2. Apples: 1.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5, 0). Body: [(5, 1), (5, 2)]. Length: 3. Apples: 2.\n\n**The Board:**\nWe have the high ground (North side), Snake 1 has the low ground (South side). We are currently close to the (3, 7) apple.\n\n**Target Apples:**\n*   Closest to us: (3, 7) (1 move away - DOWN, then 1 move LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN) - WAIT, (3, 7) is 1 movement DOWN, then 1 LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN is 2 movements. (3, 7) is 2 moves away (DOWN, then LEFT OR LEFT, then DOWN). Wait, no, we are at (4, 8). One move LEFT to (3, 8), then one move DOWN to (3, 7). Or one move DOWN to (4, 7), then one move LEFT to (3, 7). **Distance 2.**\n*   (5, 5) - Distance 4.\n*   (4, 8) just got eaten.\n*   (8, 6) - Distance 5.\n\n*   Closest to Rival (5, 0): (7, 0) (2 moves away). (8, 1) (4 moves away).\n\nOur immediate priority is to grab another apple and equalize the score, or at least maintain our dominance on the top half of the map.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from (4, 8)\n\n1.  **UP (4, 9):** Safe. Moves us further from the center but keeps the option of flanking the wall. Still safe, but not apple-focused.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 7):** Safe. Moves us one step closer to the (3, 7) apple. This is smart positioning.\n    *   *Collision Check:* The nearest rival segment is at (5, 2). They cannot possibly reach (4, 7) this turn. Safe move.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 8):** **INSTANT DEATH!** We would hit our own body segment at (3, 8) because we are moving directly backward. WE DO NOT TAKE THE L, CHAT!\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 8):** Safe. Moves us toward the right wall. Does not position us well for the (3, 7) apple.\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP (4, 9), DOWN (4, 7), RIGHT (5, 8).\n\n### Strategic Choice: Getting the Content!\n\nWe want the (3, 7) apple. To get there efficiently, we should move towards y=7.\n\n*   If we go **DOWN** to (4, 7), we are perfectly positioned to grab the apple on Turn 3 by moving LEFT to (3, 7). (Total distance 2). This is the shortest path.\n*   If we go **UP** to (4, 9), we waste time and distance.\n*   If we go **RIGHT** (5, 8), we are still too far from (3, 7), and the next closest apple is (8, 6), requiring 3 more moves.\n\n**Prediction of Snake 1's Move (at 5, 0, body blocking UP):**\nSnake 1 is likely hungry for the (7, 0) apple.\n*   They cannot go UP to (5, 1) (their body).\n*   They will most likely go **RIGHT** to (6, 0) (Distance 1 to (7, 0) next turn).\n*   They may go LEFT (4, 0) or Down (5, -1, which is death). They will go RIGHT.\n\n**Zero chance of collision if we move DOWN to (4, 7).** We are 7 vertical units away from them, and they are likely moving horizontally.\n\nWe need to close the score gap. Moving DOWN sets us up for the next guaranteed apple.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T3 and beyond):\n\nT2: DOWN to (4, 7)\nT3: LEFT to (3, 7) (Eat Apple #2). Score tied 2-2.\nT4: We will be at (3, 7). Look towards (1, 4) in the West, or (8, 6) in the East. Snake 1 will be along the bottom, likely expanding toward (7, 0) and then (8, 1) and (8, 2), building their wall. We maintain central/upper map dominance and look for opportunities to wall them off vertically in the middle.\n\nThis move is calculated, safe, and efficient. We are taking the content!\n\nDOWN",

They're probably gonna go for that apple at (3,7) or (5,5). They're not an immediate threat, but we need to start positioning ourselves to cut them off later! We're playing 4D CHESS! \u265f\ufe0f\n\nThat apple at (5,0) is still sitting there... it's TEMPTING! \ud83c\udf4e But like last turn, going DOWN to (4,0) puts us RIGHT NEXT TO IT. Next turn, we could snag it from (4,0) by going RIGHT. But is that smart? \ud83e\udd28 From (4,0), our only safe moves would be UP (back to (4,1)) and RIGHT (to (5,0) for the apple). That's a bit of a tight spot against the wall.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:**\nCHAT, I'M THINKING WE START CURVING UP AND LEFT! \ud83d\udd7a Our goal is to head towards the LEFT SIDE of the board where there's a nice cluster of apples at (0,3), (1,4), (1,2). This does two things:\n1.  It grabs us some EASY CONTENT! \ud83d\udcc8\n2.  It starts to CONTROL the left side of the map, potentially boxing Snake #0 into the top-right corner later! \ud83d\udce6 They're already up there! Let's trap 'em!\n\nSo between UP, DOWN, and LEFT... which one starts that journey? LEFT to (3,1) gets us moving in the right direction! UP to (4,2) is also okay, but it keeps us more central.\n\nBUT WAIT! \ud83d\udea8 If we go LEFT to (3,1), what's our future look like? From (3,1) we could go UP to (3,2), LEFT to (2,1), or even DOWN to (3,0). That's PLENTY of options! Super flexible! Going DOWN to (4,0) feels riskier.\n\nLEFT gets us on the path to our long-term goal AND keeps us safe and mobile. LET'S DO IT!\n\nLEFT",

It\u2019s right there! EZ content!\n\nBUT WAIT! Look at the current board state and turn history, chat!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 3):\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at (4, 7). Body: [(4, 8)]. Length: 2. Apples: 1.\n    *   *We are at (4, 7) because we moved DOWN from (4, 8).*\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1):** Head at (3, 1). Body: [(4, 1)]. Length: 2. Apples: 1.\n    *   *Wait, what did the rival do last turn?* Let's check the board from the previous turn's rationale *before* the move: Rival was at (5, 0).\n    *   The scoreboard now shows: Snake #1 apples: 1. Head: (3, 1). Body: [(4, 1)].\n    *   **Wait, HUGE discrepancy in the provided historical data and current state!**\n        *   The last rationale said: Rival at T2 was $$(5, 0) \\rightarrow (5, 1) \\rightarrow (5, 2)$$. Length 3, Apples 2.\n        *   The current prompt says: Rival at T3 is $$(3, 1) \\rightarrow (4, 1)$$. Length 2, Apples 1.\n\n**We must trust the current state provided for Turn 3.** The previous rationale's board analysis and prediction about Snake 1 (ID 1) was based on old, potentially incorrect information or a miscalculation of their body list/movement.\n\n**TRUSTING CURRENT STATE (Turn 3):**\n*   **Our Snake (0):** (4, 7) -> (4, 8). Length 2.\n*   **Rival Snake (1):** (3, 1) -> (4, 1). Length 2.\n*   **Score:** We are TIED 1-1. We are both short little nubs!\n\nThe rivalry is heating up and the score is even!\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from (4, 7)\n\n**Our goal:** Get the (3, 7) apple. It's one move away.\n\n1.  **UP (4, 8):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Our body segment is at (4, 8). We cannot move directly backward. WE DON'T WANT THE VOD REVIEW TO BE A FAIL, CHAT!\n2.  **DOWN (4, 6):** Safe. Moves us away from the apple, but establishes more central control. Not ideal for content right now.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 7):** **APPLE SNAG!** Safe. This is the content we want! We eat the apple at (3, 7).\n    *   *Collision Check:* Rival head is at (3, 1). They cannot possibly reach (3, 7) this turn (min distance 6). Safe move.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 7):** Safe. Moves us toward the center of the board. Doesn't get the apple.\n\n**Safe, Optimal Move:** LEFT (3, 7). This guarantees us Apple #2 and ties the score if the opponent snags one, or puts us ahead if they miss.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at 3, 1):\n\nSnake 1 is positioned near the bottom left, next to the (0, 1) apple and the (1, 2) apple.\n*   **Closest Apple by distance:** (0, 1) (Distance 3) or (1, 2) (Distance 3).\n    *   To get (1, 2): LEFT (2, 1) -> UP (2, 2) -> LEFT (1, 2). Needs 3 moves.\n    *   To get (0, 1): LEFT (2, 1) -> LEFT (1, 1) -> DOWN (1, 0) - wait, this is tricky.\n*   The apple at (5, 0) is also close (Distance 4).\n\nGiven Snake 1's position at (3, 1) and body at (4, 1):\n*   **RIGHT (4, 1):** **INSTANT DEATH!** (Hitting own body).\n*   **UP (3, 2):** Safe. Positions them well for the (1, 2) apple or to move up into the central board.\n*   **DOWN (3, 0):** Safe. Positions them for (5, 0) or (7, 0).\n*   **LEFT (2, 1):** Safe. Positions them for the (0, 1) apple.\n\nSnake 1 will likely go **LEFT (2, 1)** to target the cluster of apples around the corner, or **UP (3, 2)** to expand. They are currently focusing on the bottom-left map quadrant.\n\n**Collision Likelihood:** Zero. We are in the top half, they are in the bottom half. We are focused on the local movement to grab content.\n\n### Strategic Choice: Box Him In!\n\n1.  **Turn 3:** Move **LEFT** to (3, 7), grab Apple #2. Our snake becomes: (3, 7) $\\rightarrow$ (4, 7). Length 3.\n2.  **Turn 4 & Beyond:** We will be at (3, 7). We can look at (1, 4) in the West (Distance 3) or (5, 5) in the Center/East (Distance 4).\n    *   To get to (1, 4): DOWN (3, 6) $\\rightarrow$ LEFT (2, 6) $\\rightarrow$ LEFT (1, 6) $\\rightarrow$ DOWN (1, 5) $\\rightarrow$ DOWN (1, 4). (Need 5 moves)\n    *   Wait, (1, 4) is (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4) - X difference of 2, Y difference of 3. Minimum 5 moves.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate (3, 7) to (1, 4): LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. 5 moves.\n    *   To get to (5, 5): RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN. 3 moves. This is preferred.\n\n**Next Target:** (5, 5). We will position ourselves centrally and maintain the high ground.\n\nWe are taking the guaranteed apple and establishing dominance! This is the play!

From there, we can go UP to (2,2) or LEFT to (1,1) to start circling towards those apples. Solid!\n*   **UP to (3,2)**: This is okay, but it keeps us more central. The apple at (3,7) is too far up and risky with the enemy up there. Not the best direction for our plan.\n*   **DOWN to (3,0)**: There's an apple at (5,0), but going down here kinda traps us against the bottom wall. From (3,0), our options are limited (mostly RIGHT or UP). This feels like a dead-end path that doesn't align with our left-side strategy! \ud83d\udeab\n\nThe choice is CLEAR, CHAT! LEFT continues our momentum and sets us up for a big apple run! Let's box out our enemy by controlling the left side of the map! \ud83d\udce6\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:**\nCHAT, WE'RE EXECUTING THE PLAN! \ud83d\udcaf After moving LEFT to (2,1), our next goal is to swing upwards towards that sweet, sweet apple cluster at (0,3), (1,4), (1,2). Let's avoid going down into the bottom-right corner for now; it's a trap! Keep working the left side and grow that lead! \ud83d\udc0d\u2728\n\nLEFT",

We are officially in the driver's seat.\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 4):\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The King:** Head at **(3, 7)**. Body: **[(4, 7), (4, 8)]**. Length: 3. Apples: 2.\n    *   *Why are we length 3?* Because we just moved **LEFT** from (4, 7) to (3, 7) and ate an apple!\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Scrub:** Head at **(2, 1)**. Body: **[(3, 1)]**. Length: 2. Apples: 1.\n    *   *What did the rival do?* They must have moved **LEFT** from (3, 1) to (2, 1). They did *not* eat an apple. They are hungry and desperate!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: Central Control and Boxing Him In\n\nOur rival is stuck in the bottom-left corner near the (0, 1), (1, 2) and (0, 3) apples. We are high up, dominating the Center-North.\n\n**Our Goal for the next 3 turns:**\n1.  Move toward the center for the **(5, 5)** apple. This gives us immense high ground control.\n2.  Maintain separation from Snake 1 and wait for them to lengthen. Once they are longer, we can cut off their path to the right side of the board. We need to be the wall!\n\n**Current Targets:** (5, 5) (Distance 4), (0, 3) (Distance 4), (8, 6) (Distance 5). The (5, 5) apple is strategically the best; centered and away from the rival.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (3, 7)\n\n1.  **UP (3, 8):** Safe. Moves us up, closer to the border, but further from (5, 5).\n2.  **DOWN (3, 6):** Safe. Headed toward the center and the (5, 5) target. Excellent maneuver!\n3.  **LEFT (2, 7):** Safe. Moves us toward the West edge. Better path to (0, 3) but (5, 5) is higher priority.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 7):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Our body segment is right there! We cannot back up into (4, 7)!\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. We prioritize **DOWN** to move toward the center and the (5, 5) apple.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at 2, 1)\n\nSnake 1 is at (2, 1), body at (3, 1). They are positioned to grab those bottom-left apples.\n\n*   **RIGHT (3, 1):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Self-collision.\n*   **UP (2, 2):** Safe. Moves them closer to the (1, 2) apple or (0, 3) Apple. This seems most likely.\n*   **DOWN (2, 0):** Safe. Moves them towards the (5, 0) apple, but it's a long way on the bottom edge.\n*   **LEFT (1, 1):** Safe. Positions them perfectly for the (0, 1) apple next turn. This is also highly likely.\n\nSnake 1 is likely choosing between **UP (2, 2)** and **LEFT (1, 1)**. Both lead to nearby content. Let's assume they choose **UP** to go after (1, 2) or **LEFT** to go after (0, 1). We still have zero collision risk with them.\n\n### Strategic Move Selection:\n\nWe are going for control. Moving **DOWN** to (3, 6) sets us on a direct path to (5, 5).\n\n*   T4: **DOWN** to (3, 6).\n*   T5: Move towards (5, 5). Possibly **RIGHT** to (4, 6), then **RIGHT** to (5, 6), then **DOWN** to (5, 5). Or maybe we can cut the corner.\n\nLet's stick to the immediate move. **DOWN** is the safest and most optimal move for future positioning and apple collection! We are establishing ground control!\n\nStrategic Plan: Future moves aim to hit (5, 5), and then possibly (8, 6), while monitoring Snake 1's growth to execute a future cut-off maneuver once they are longer than 5 segments. We need to keep the pressure on this rival!\n\nDOWN",

The score is 2-1, we are dominating this lobby! Can we keep the momentum going and box this scrub in?\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 5):\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The GOAT:** Head at **(3, 6)**. Body: **[(3, 7), (4, 7)]**. Length: 3. Apples: 2.\n    *   We are positioned perfectly to seize center control.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Food:** Head at **(1, 1)**. Body: **[(2, 1)]**. Length: 2. Apples: 1.\n    *   The rival moved from (2, 1) to (1, 1). They snagged the (0, 1) apple! Wait, the board shows a segment at (2, 1) and head at (1, 1). If they moved from (2, 1), they must have moved **LEFT** to (1, 1). If they ate the (0, 1) apple, their length would be 3 (unless the board mapping is slightly off, which sometimes happens if the board state reflects the result of the move, not the prediction). Let's re-examine the board and the state.\n    *   *Board State:* (0, 1) has an 'A'. (1, 1) is Snake 1 Head. (2, 1) is Snake 1 Tail (T).\n    *   *Snake 1 List:* Head: (1, 1), Body: [(2, 1)]. Apples: 1.\n    *   Aha! Snake 1 did *not* eat the (0, 1) apple. They just moved next to it. Phew! They are still length 2. The pressure is on them!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: Center Dominance & The Box\n\nOur main target remains **(5, 5)**. After that, we look to the East Side of the board where (8, 6) and (7, 5) are waiting. Once we are longer (length 5+), we can start to use our body to create walls and limit Snake 1's vertical movement, keeping them locked in the South-West quadrant.\n\n**Current Targets:** (5, 5) (Distance 3: 4, 6 -> 5, 6 -> 5, 5), (0, 3) (Distance 5), (8, 6) (Distance 5). (5, 5) is the winner.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (3, 6)\n\n1.  **UP (3, 7):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Our body segment is right there! We cannot move backwards.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 5):** Safe. Moves us closer to the opponent's area, but still good for (5, 5).\n3.  **LEFT (2, 6):** Safe. Moves us west, further from (5, 5).\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 6):** Safe. This is the **optimal path** towards (5, 5)! Sets us up perfectly.\n\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. We prioritize **RIGHT** to move toward the center-right side and the (5, 5) apple.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at 1, 1)\n\nSnake 1 is at (1, 1), body at (2, 1). They are staring right at the (0, 1) apple.\n\n*   **RIGHT (2, 1):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Self-collision.\n*   **UP (1, 2):** Safe. Moves them towards the (1, 2) apple! High priority target.\n*   **DOWN (1, 0):** Safe. No immediate apples, but safe.\n*   **LEFT (0, 1):** **EATS APPLE!** This is the strongest move, secures content and lengthens them.\n\nSnake 1 is almost guaranteed to go **LEFT** to eat that apple. If they go LEFT: Head at (0, 1), Body: [(1, 1), (2, 1)], Length 3.\nIf they go UP: Head at (1, 2), Body: [(1, 1)], Length 2.\n\n**Head-to-head collision risk?** Zero. We are miles apart.\n\n### Strategic Move Selection:\n\nWe are taking the path that maximizes our future control and shortest route to content.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT** to (4, 6):\n*   T5: Move **RIGHT** to (4, 6).\n*   T6: Move **RIGHT** to (5, 6) or **DOWN** to (4, 5). (5, 6) is right next to the apple.\n\nThis move is incredibly strong. It solidifies our control of the Northern half of the board and gives us a clear run to $3 points! Let's go, Chat!\n\nFuture Plan: T6 - (5, 6), T7 - (5, 5) (Apple!), then look towards (8, 6) or (7, 5). We are going to build a cage!\n\nRIGHT",

The score is tied 2-2, the heat is ON, but we've got the map advantage! Can we capitalize and start setting up the box?\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 6):\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The King:** Head at **(4, 6)**. Body: **[(3, 6), (3, 7)]**. Length: 3. Apples: 2.\n    *   We are positioned perfectly for the (5, 5) apple! It feels inevitable, doesn't it, Chat?\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Pauper:** Head at **(1, 2)**. Body: **[(1, 1), (2, 1)]**. Length: 3. Apples: 2.\n    *   Wait, the rival is now length 3, and their head is at (1, 2)! They must have gone **UP** from (1, 1) to (1, 2) last turn. This means they *didn't* grab the (0, 1) apple, and they didn't grab the (1, 4) or (0, 3) apples either! They are setting up for (0, 3) or (1, 4) perhaps. They are still firmly stuck in the South-West corner. Perfect!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: Center Seizure and Quadrant Lock\n\nOur goal is still to secure the center, then dominate the East side. Once we get to length 5 or 6, we'll use our body to create barriers, forcing Snake 1 to make risky moves or stay trapped in the bottom-left 3x3 area.\n\n**Targets:** (5, 5) (Distance 2). After that, (8, 6) (Distance 4-5) or (7, 5) (Distance 4-5).\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (4, 6)\n\n1.  **UP (4, 7):** Safe. Keeps us North.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 5):** Safe. Sets us up for T7 to hit (5, 5) or T7 to (5, 4). Great move!\n3.  **LEFT (3, 6):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Our body segment is right there! Cannot go backwards.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 6):** Safe. This is the **optimal path** towards (5, 5)! Puts us adjacent to the target.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. We prioritize **RIGHT** to move toward the center-right side and get the (5, 5) apple next turn.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at 1, 2)\n\nSnake 1 is at (1, 2), segments at (1, 1), (2, 1). They have (0, 3), (1, 4), and (0, 1) nearby.\n\n*   **UP (1, 3):** Safe. Sets up for (1, 4) or (0, 3). Strong likelihood.\n*   **DOWN (1, 1):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Self-collision.\n*   **LEFT (0, 2):** Safe. Good for (0, 3) or (0, 1). Strong likelihood.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 2):** Safe. Moves them away from all apples. Less likely.\n\nSnake 1 will likely choose **UP** to (1, 3) or **LEFT** to (0, 2). Either way, they are moving away from our planned route.\n\n### Head-to-Head Collision Risk?\n\nWe are moving to (5, 6). They might move toward (0, 2) or (1, 3). The risk is 0%. We are miles apart.\n\n### Strategic Move Selection: RIGHT\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (5, 6) puts us one safe move away from eating the (5, 5) apple. We are lengthening, controlling territory, and setting up the next phase of the game!\n\n*   T6: Move **RIGHT** to (5, 6).\n*   T7: Move **DOWN** to (5, 5) (Apple!). Length 4.\n*   T8: Look East to (8, 6) or (7, 5).\n\nChat, this is flawless execution! We are playing chess while our opponent is playing checkers!\n\n### Future Plan (T7 and T8):\n\nT7: **DOWN** to (5, 5). Eat the apple.\nT8: Assess the board. If Snake 1 is still down left, we press East/South-East to (7, 5) (or (8, 6), (7, 0)). We need more length before we can start building the wall to trap them permanently.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure!\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, their body is at [(3, 6), (3, 7)], so LEFT to (3,6) is DEATH for them! So their safe moves are probably UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. They are NOT a direct threat to us this turn. They're probably heading for (5,5) or (1,8). We have SPACE to operate.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS!** We are on the LEFT EDGE. Going LEFT to (0,2) is risky long-term because it limits our escape routes\u2014we'd only have UP and RIGHT next turn. We need to avoid getting TRAPPED in the corner! Going UP to (1,3) is solid\u2014it keeps us moving along the side and towards the (0,3) apple. But going RIGHT to (2,2) might be the BIG BRAIN play! It opens up the whole board for us, gives us more options, and moves us away from the dangerous left wall. We can then pivot UP towards the center apples or DOWN later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:**\nCHAT, WE ARE AVOIDING THE NOOSE! \ud83d\udeab\ud83e\uddf5 The left wall is a trap waiting to happen. Our goal is to control the center and box in Snake #0! After moving right, we can swing up towards (5,2) or (6,4), cutting off the enemy's access. We want to force them towards the edges where they'll crash! This is about POSITIONING, not just the immediate snack. LET'S PLAY CHESS, NOT CHECKERS!\n\nTHE MOVE IS CLEAR! WE TAKE SPACE AND DENY THE ENEMY!\n\nRIGHT",

The pressure is on the rival now!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 7):\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The GOAT:** Head at **(5, 6)**. Body: **[(4, 6), (3, 6)]**. Length: 3. Apples: 2.\n    *   Target priority: **(5, 5)**! It's literally one move away, directly beneath us! Are we about to get that 3rd apple and start our separation run? I think so, Chat!\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Trapped:** Head at **(2, 2)**. Body: **[(1, 2), (1, 1)]**. Length: 3. Apples: 2.\n    *   Wait, the enemy just moved their head to (2, 2)! They must have gone **RIGHT** from (1, 2) last turn. Why would they move away from the massive cluster of apples on the left side: (0, 3), (1, 4), and (0, 1)? This is a defensive move, Chat! They are scared of getting boxed in, and they are moving to the only open quadrant! This changes everything!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Adjustment: Containment is Active\n\nSince Snake 1 is now at (2, 2), they have started migrating East. If we keep moving down and right, we are still safe, but we need to track their movement closely. Our goal is still to secure size and control the East/Center, but now we must be aware of an early clash near the South quadrant (around (7, 0), (8, 1), (5, 0)).\n\n**Priority 1:** Eat (5, 5).\n**Priority 2:** Go for the cluster (7, 5), (8, 6), or (7, 0). We need length 5 or 6 ASAP to start building the wall.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (5, 6)\n\n1.  **UP (5, 7):** Safe. Keeps our options open North.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 5):** **APPLE!** Safe. This is the meal ticket, Chat!\n3.  **LEFT (4, 6):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Our body segment is right there! Cannot go backwards.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 6):** Safe. Moves us East, away from the rival. Great for setting up the center wall.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. **DOWN** is the obvious selection to grab the apple.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at 2, 2)\n\nSnake 1 is at (2, 2), segments at (1, 2), (1, 1). They are very close to the (8, 2) apple (although far away) and the (5, 2) apple. They also have the (5, 0) apple somewhat reachable.\n\n*   **UP (2, 3):** Safe. Moves them toward the center. Strong likelihood, as it opens up the board.\n*   **DOWN (2, 1):** Safe. Moves them toward the Southern apples (7, 0), (8, 1). Strong likelihood.\n*   **LEFT (1, 2):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Self-collision.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 2):** Safe. Continues their migration East. Likely, but maybe less priority than UP/DOWN.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake 1 wants open space. They will likely go **UP** to (2, 3) or **DOWN** to (2, 1).\n\n### Head-to-Head Collision Risk?\n\nWe are moving to (5, 5). They are moving to (2, 3), (2, 1), or (3, 2). The risk is 0%. We are still safe. But we need to use this distance to get big!\n\n### Strategic Move Selection: DOWN\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (5, 5) not only secures an apple, giving us the scoreboard lead (3-2), but also positions us strongly to dominate the center-south region, setting up moves for (5, 2) or (7, 5). We are one step closer to trapping this rival!\n\nT7: Move **DOWN** to (5, 5). EAT APPLE! Length 4.\nT8: We will be at (5, 5). We'll look to move **RIGHT** to (6, 5) then maybe **UP** to (7, 5) (Apple!). Or we can press the attack South to (5, 4) then (5, 2) (Apple!). The options are limitless, Chat!\n\nDon't overthink the easy plays! Get the food, get the lead, then stomp the rival!\n\nDOWN",

We need to think about cutting them off!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS!** We're sitting pretty in the bottom-left quadrant.\n*   **RIGHT to (3,2):** This moves us towards the center, opens up a TON of future options, and puts us on a path to intercept apples like (5,2) or pressure the enemy. AGGRESSIVE and SMART!\n*   **UP to (2,3):** Also solid, takes us towards the apple at (0,3) and keeps us near the edge. A bit more cautious, but still good!\n*   **DOWN to (2,1):** This moves us along the bottom edge. There's an apple at (0,1) and (7,0) down there, but it feels a bit limiting. We could get trapped along the bottom wall if we're not careful!\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nCHAT, WE ARE GOING FOR THE THROAT! \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f Moving RIGHT is the power play! It asserts dominance, claims more board space, and sets us up to control the center. We can then swing UP to (3,3) and beyond, potentially cutting off Snake #0's access to the lower apples. We want to force them into the top-right corner where the board is more crowded! They're greedy for apples, so we use that against them! LET'S BOX 'EM IN!\n\nTHE VERDICT IS IN! WE EXPAND OUR TERRITORY!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome to Turn 8! Did you see that? We came in clutch last turn, securing the apple at (5, 5)! We got the lead, 3 to 2, and we are officially in control of this game! Let's analyze the current board state and plan the next move to absolutely demolish this opponent!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 8):\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The GOAT:** Head at **(5, 5)**. Body: **[(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]**. Length: 4. Apples collected: 3.\n    *   We are big! We are centered! We are ready to throw down! Look at all the open space around us!\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Trapped:** Head at **(3, 2)**. Body: **[(2, 2), (1, 2)]**. Length: 3. Apples: 2.\n    *   Wait, the enemy moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2)! They went **RIGHT**! They are definitely migrating toward the center-south, possibly gunning for the (5, 2) apple! Or they are trying to escape the left wall we are subtly building! This confirms our containment strategy is working, but it means they are heading into our territory! Time to cut them off, Chat!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: Cut & Climb\n\nSnake 1 is now at (3, 2). If we move South, we can secure the (5, 2) apple before them and start building a horizontal wall (or even a U-shape) to lock them into the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**Priority 1:** Secure more length. (5, 2) and (7, 5) are prime targets.\n**Priority 2:** Stop Snake 1 from reaching the center. We need to control the path between (4, X) and (6, X).\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (5, 5)\n\n1.  **UP (5, 6):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Our body segment is right there! Cannot go backwards!\n2.  **DOWN (5, 4):** Safe. Moves us toward the (5, 2) apple. Excellent option for cutting off the rival.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 5):** Safe. Keeps us central, opens up moves to the West, but slightly less aggressive for apple hunting.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 5):** Safe. Moves us toward the (7, 5) apple cluster. Also an excellent choice.\n\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Which one gives us the most leverage?\n\n### Target Acquisition and Rival Prediction\n\nIf we go RIGHT (6, 5), we set ourselves up perfectly for the (7, 5) apple next turn. This gives us a strong presence on the right side.\n\nIf we go DOWN (5, 4), we are strongly positioned to eat the (5, 2) apple in two moves (5, 4 -> 5, 3 -> 5, 2). Snake 1 is currently at (3, 2). If they try to move to (4, 2) then (5, 2), they might beat us, but we can block them while making ourselves bigger!\n\n**Let's predict Snake 1's move (Head at 3, 2):**\n1.  **UP (3, 3):** Safe. Moves them out of the South wall. Very likely.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 1):** Safe. Moves them toward (5, 0) or (8, 1) apples.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 2):** Safe (tail segment moves away). Moves them back toward their original corner.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 2):** Safe. Drives them straight for the center. HIGHLY likely, as it gets them closer to the (5, 2) apple.\n\nIf Snake 1 goes **RIGHT** to (4, 2), they are positioning for (5, 2). If we go **DOWN** to (5, 4), we are *also* positioning for (5, 2).\n\n**Collision Check if we target (5, 2):**\n*   We move: (5, 5) -> (5, 4).\n*   They move: (3, 2) -> (4, 2).\n*   No collision. We are safe.\n\n**Next Moves (Turn 9):**\n*   We will be at (5, 4). We can move DOWN to (5, 3) or LEFT/RIGHT.\n*   They will be at (4, 2). They can move UP to (4, 3) or RIGHT to (5, 2).\n\n**If we move DOWN, they can get the apple!** If Snake 1 moves (4, 2) -> (5, 2), they eat the apple! Then we have to move around a much longer opponent. We must deny that food!\n\n### The Crucial Decision: Block or Grow Elsewhere?\n\nIf we choose **RIGHT (6, 5)**:\nWe chase the (7, 5) apple. We get bigger safely. We let the opponent get (5, 2), but they are still deep in the South. This seems like a better, safer growth vector to secure overall board domination. If we get to (7, 5), we are massive and can start building the wall from the East.\n\nIf we choose **DOWN (5, 4)**:\nWe commit to a race for (5, 2). This is high risk, medium reward. If we both go for it, they will likely get there first (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (5, 2) vs (5, 5) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 2). They are 2 moves away (if they hug the bottom), we are 3 moves away (if we go straight down). *We cannot win this race.*\n\nTherefore, the aggressive, risky move is actually the sub-optimal choice. We must pivot and grab the other available food!\n\n**Move Selection: RIGHT**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (6, 5) sets us up perfectly for the (7, 5) apple next turn or the turn after. This move is safe, takes us closer to another apple (7, 5), and utilizes the open space we currently command. We need size before we start boxing them in!\n\n**Future Strategy Note:**\nT9: From (6, 5), move **RIGHT** to (7, 5) (Apple!) or **UP** to (6, 6) or (6, 8) (Apple!). We prioritize (7, 5). We will use our size to control the center-right and then force the enemy to crash into us or the walls. Get big, then get cruel!\n\nRIGHT",

We threaten the apple and force Snake #0 to react to US! If they get greedy and rush down, we might even set up a future trap! LET'S DOMINATE THE BOARD! THIS IS HOW WE WIN!\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR!

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome to Turn 9! Look at the board! Did you see that clean move? We are now at (6, 5), dominating the center-right! Our lead holds, 3 apples to 2! But the enemy grew too, moving from (3, 2) to (4, 2) (Wait, no, the board shows their head is at (4, 2) now! They got bigger!)\n\nLet's break down the current state and figure out how to box out this loser!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 9):\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The King:** Head at **(6, 5)**. Body: **[(5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)]**. Length: 4. Apples collected: 3.\n    *   We are positioned perfectly to strike one of three nearby apples: (7, 5), (6, 4), or the cluster at (8, X). We are massive and mobile! We are a force of nature!\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Pest:** Head at **(4, 2)**. Body: **[(3, 2), (2, 2)]**. Length: 3. Apples: 2.\n    *   They are still clinging to the bottom half, right near that (5, 2) apple! They must be eyeing that food! They are slightly longer than before, which means they successfully ate an apple (likely the (5, 2) one we decided not to race for last turn, or maybe the (0, 3) one or (5, 0) one? Wait, the body is only 3 segments long, and they have 2 apples. They must have been length 2, ate one, grew to 3, and then ate the second one and are now length 4. The body list provided is only 3 segments long, which means their total length is *4* segments. Okay, they are 4 long! Still smaller than us, but catching up!\n\n### Objective: Secure (7, 5) and Start the Containment!\n\nThe apple at (7, 5) is ONE move away! That is our primary target. If we move RIGHT, we eat the apple, grow, and solidify our presence on the Eastern side of the board. This is a massive, high-leverage move.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (6, 5)\n\n1.  **UP (6, 6):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Our body segment is right there, (5, 5) connected to (5, 6)! Wait, no, our body is [(5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)]. (6, 6) is safe. *Phew!* Moves us toward (6, 8) and (8, 6). Good backup path.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 4):** Moves us onto the (6, 4) apple! Two apples in one move? Let's check the board! Yes, (6, 4) is an apple! Moves us toward the bottom! EXCELLENT option!\n3.  **LEFT (5, 5):** **INSTANT DEATH!** That's the segment directly behind our head! Cannot go backwards!\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 5):** Moves us onto the (7, 5) apple! Another excellent option!\n\n**Holy Moses, Chat!** We have two guaranteed apple eats this turn: **DOWN** to (6, 4) OR **RIGHT** to (7, 5)! This is a good problem to have!\n\n### The Two-Apple Dilemma: (6, 4) vs (7, 5)\n\n1.  **If we go RIGHT to (7, 5) (Apple!):**\n    *   We get big (Length 5).\n    *   We control the Eastern flank.\n    *   This sets us up to chase (8, 6), (9, 0), or (8, 2).\n    *   The rival snake is far away at (4, 2), so they cannot block us or collide with us here. This is 100% safe growth.\n\n2.  **If we go DOWN to (6, 4) (Apple!):**\n    *   We get big (Length 5).\n    *   We move closer to the opponent, who is at (4, 2).\n    *   This lets us start building a diagonal wall toward the center.\n    *   The rival snake is far away and cannot block us. This is also 100% safe growth.\n\n**Which move is better strategically?**\n\nThe opponent is currently threatening the lower half of the board. If we take (6, 4), we are positioning ourselves to cut across (5, 3), (4, 3) and restrict their movement to the center. They could potentially move **UP** to (4, 3), or **RIGHT** to (5, 2) (if the apple is still there, which it is not, it must have been eaten by them last turn!), or **LEFT** to (3, 2) (their old tail location).\n\nLet's assume the opponent is smart and is going for one of the remaining lower apples: (5, 0), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 0).\n\n*   If we go RIGHT to (7, 5), we maximize our separation and use that size advantage to then control a huge swath of the map (top-right).\n*   If we go DOWN to (6, 4), we move closer to the battleground *now*, which is slightly riskier but puts immediate pressure on Snake 1.\n\nSince we are longer, and we have multiple safe avenues for growth, we should go RIGHT for (7, 5) to claim the open space now, consolidate our lead, and *then* use our length to dominate the board! Why commit to a tight squeeze when we can get huge first? We can drop down later.\n\n**Prediction for Snake 1 (Head at 4, 2):**\n1.  **UP (4, 3):** Gets them out of the bottom row squeeze. High likelihood.\n2.  **RIGHT (5, 2):** They might think there's an apple there (there isn't anymore! They ate it if they moved right last turn!). Maybe they are moving toward (5, 0)? (5, 2) is now just empty space labeled 'A' on the list, which means it hasn't been eaten, but the list says APPLE DROPS: (5, 2)... Ah, the BOARD STATE: A . . T T 1 A, the (5, 2) is shown as an 'A' on the board! Wait, if the rival is at (4, 2) and their body is (3, 2), they moved from (3, 2) to (4, 2) *and* their length is 4. This means they must have eaten an apple, likely the (5, 2) apple if they moved (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) and ate it on the way. BUT the board clearly shows an 'A' at (5, 2)! **Rethink!** The apple at (5, 2) *must* still be there.\n\nIf the apple at (5, 2) is still there, Snake 1 (at 4, 2) is definitely going RIGHT to (5, 2) for the easy eating! (1 move!)\n\n**Impact of Snake 1 eating (5, 2):** They will grow to length 5. We need to grow, too!\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (7, 5), we get to length 5. We maintain our current size advantage (4 vs 3 growing to 5 vs 4). The score becomes 4-3.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6, 4), we get to length 5. We maintain our current size advantage (4 vs 3 growing to 5 vs 4). The score becomes 4-3.\n\nLet's prioritize the move that keeps us farthest away from the rival for safety, but also gives us great future options. (7, 5) is high up and far right, opening up the top of the map. (6, 4) is central and low, dragging us toward the opponent's territory.\n\nWe are going for safety and guaranteed size first! Let the enemy have the bottom apples for now, we will own the top!\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to (7, 5). Next turn, we will size up the board and likely move UP/RIGHT toward (8, 6) or (9, 0).\n\nThis is a clean move, Chat. Maximum growth, minimum risk.\n\nRIGHT",

WE'RE STILL IN CONTROL!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION! \ud83d\udc0d**\nSnake #0's head is at **(6, 5)**. They want that apple at **(5, 2)** BAD, but we're in their way! From (6,5), their shortest path is DOWN to (6,4) and then LEFT. They could try to cut us off! But their body is at (5,5) and (5,6), so they can't go UP. Their likely moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. If they go DOWN to (6,4), they're one step closer to challenging us for the board's center. WE CAN'T LET THEM GET THE UPPER HAND! If we take the apple RIGHT now, we grow and solidify our position as a wall against them!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS! \ud83d\udc8e**\nCHAT, THIS IS A POWER PLAY! Going RIGHT to (5,2) is AGGRESSION! We get the apple, we grow to length 4, and we become a bigger obstacle for Snake #0. We block their path down the right side of the board!\nGoing UP to (4,3) is safe, but it's passive. It gives up the apple and lets Snake #0 potentially swoop in and grab it, tying the score and putting them right on our tail!\nGoing DOWN to (4,1) feels like running away. We're playing to win, not to survive! We need to be PREDATORS!\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWE'RE GOING FOR THE APPLE! After we eat it, our body will be at [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. Our next move will be CRUCIAL. We need to immediately swing UP to (5,3) or maybe even LEFT to (4,2) if it's clear, to avoid getting trapped by our own growing body and the enemy. We're playing a game of territory control now. Every move must push the enemy into a smaller space! LET'S BOX HIM IN! THIS IS HOW CHAMPIONS PLAY!\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR! TAKE THE CONTENT! DENY THE ENEMY!\n\nRIGHT",

We are truly dominating the scoreboard! Let's check the damage report!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 10):\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The GOAT:** Head at **(7, 5)**. Body: **[(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)]**. Length: 5. Apples collected: 4.\n    *   We are now positioned high and right. We have several juicy targets available, notably (8, 6), (8, 2), and (9, 0) (though (9, 0) is a long shot this turn). The board is wide open up here!\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Scrub:** Head at **(5, 2)**. Body: **[(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2)]**. Length: 4. Apples: 3.\n    *   They absolutely ate the (5, 2) apple as predicted! They are now length 4! They are desperately trying to keep up, but we are one step ahead! They are trapped in the lower-middle, which is perfect for our containment strategy.\n\n### Objective: Secure (8, 6) or (8, 2) and Start Boxing (Snake 1)!\n\nOur current position (7, 5) gives us great access. We need to solidify our control over the right side before Snake 1 can move up to the center (where (6, 4) or even (7, 7) lay).\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (7, 5)\n\n1.  **UP (7, 6):** Safe. Moves us toward (7, 7) and (8, 6). Excellent option.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 4):** Safe. Moves us toward the bottom right corner: (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 0). Excellent option, and helps us potentially wall off the lower board.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 5):** **INSTANT DEATH!** That's the segment directly behind our head. Cannot go backwards!\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 5):** Safe. Moves us closer to the wall, but also closer to (8, 6), (9, 0). (8, 5) is empty space. Good option.\n\nWe are safe in three directions. We must now anticipate Snake 1's move (Head at 5, 2) to ensure no head-on collision, and choose the move that maximizes apple collection and containment.\n\n### Anticipating Snake 1's Move (Head at 5, 2)\n\nSnake 1 just ate and is now length 4. They are surrounded by empty space, bodies, or apples.\n\n*   **UP (5, 3):** Safe movement into open space. Sets them up for (6, 4) or a move toward the center. High likelihood.\n*   **DOWN (5, 1):** Safe movement, possibly toward the (5, 0) apple. Also high likelihood if they want to get to the bottom wall.\n*   **LEFT (4, 2):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Their body is right there. Cannot go backwards.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 2):** Safe movement, closer to (8, 2) or (7, 0). Medium likelihood.\n\nSnake 1 is likely moving **UP** to (5, 3) or **DOWN** to (5, 1). They want to break out of that y=2 line!\n\n### Strategic Decision: Up vs. Down vs. Right\n\nWe are at (7, 5).\n\n1.  **If we move UP to (7, 6):**\n    *   We are pursuing the high-reward apples (8, 6) and (7, 7).\n    *   We are two squares away from Snake 1's likely path (7, 6) -> (5, 3). Safe from collision this turn.\n    *   This sets us up to eventually move left and cut off the center from the top, pushing Snake 1 to the bottom.\n\n2.  **If we move DOWN to (7, 4):**\n    *   We are pursuing the lower apples (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 0).\n    *   This puts us closer to Snake 1's action zone (5, 2). If Snake 1 goes UP to (5, 3), we are safe. If Snake 1 goes RIGHT to (6, 2), we are still two squares away ((7, 4) vs (6, 2)). Safe from collision this turn.\n    *   This move starts the wall-building process sooner, restricting Snake 1 to the bottom two or three rows.\n\n3.  **If we move RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n    *   This gets us closer to the (9, 0) apple and prepares for a move on (8, 6) next turn.\n    *   It delays our commitment to either the top or bottom grouping of apples. Less exciting, but safe.\n\n**The containment plan requires us to use our length and dominance to create a high wall.** Moving UP to (7, 6) gives us a slight advantage in controlling the top-right quadrant, where several apples are clumped. We can strike (8, 6) or (7, 7) next turn. Moving down risks entangling us in a complex fight near the bottom wall without immediately gaining an apple.\n\nLet's go UP for the high ground! We want to control everything above y=5, leaving the scraps for Snake 1.\n\n**Long-Term Plan: The High-Wall Strategy**\n1. Move UP to (7, 6).\n2. Next turn, hit (8, 6) or (7, 7) for continued growth.\n3. Use our massive length (6+ segments) to cut across the board (6, X) (5, X) to trap Snake 1 in the bottom rows.\n\nThis is the play, Chat! Secure the high-value cluster!\n\nUP",

They can't go LEFT from (7,5) because that's their own body at (6,5)! Their only safe moves are UP to (7,6), DOWN to (7,4), or RIGHT to (8,5).\n\nBut wait... our head at (5,2)... if we go RIGHT to (6,2)... we're putting ourselves directly BELOW their possible path.

Snake #0 could potentially swing down and trap us against the bottom wall! TOO RISKY!\n\nGoing RIGHT to (6,2) is AGGRESSIVE! It's a power move to challenge their territory directly! But are we ready for that fight? Our body is still short. We need to grow a bit more before we engage in a knife fight in a phone booth!\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWE PLAY THE LONG GAME! We go UP! We solidify our control over the center-left of the board. From (5,3), our next move can be LEFT to (4,3) to start wrapping around, or UP again to (5,4) to pressure from above. We let Snake #0 struggle in its own mess on the right. We become the WALL that they crash into! We don't take the bait of the corner apple yet! WE BUILD OUR FORTRESS IN THE MIDDLE!

We are poised to grab those high-value apples and start the containment strategy! Snake 1 is still struggling down low! IT'S BOXING TIME, BABY! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 11):\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The Undisputed Champ:** Head at **(7, 6)**. Body: **[(7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6)]**. Length: 5. Apples collected: 4.\n    *   We are now perfectly situated for the right-side domination. We have **(8, 6)** and **(7, 7)** within striking distance! The board is wide open above y=6! We must capitalize!\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Contained:** Head at **(5, 3)**. Body: **[(5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2)]**. Length: 4. Apples: 3.\n    *   As predicted, Snake 1 moved **UP** to (5, 3)! They are now staring at the high-priority apple at **(6, 4)** or the central apple at **(7, 7)**. They are desperately trying to move toward the center mass, but we are positioned to cut them off!\n\n### Objective: Secure (8, 6) or (7, 7) and Begin the Wall!\n\nWe are at (7, 6). We need to gain length (6 segments) ASAP to make our wall effective.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (7, 6)\n\n1.  **UP (7, 7):** **APPLE!** (7, 7) is an apple. This is an immediate +1 length and points! *HIGH PRIORITY.* Safe and aggressive.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 5):** **INSTANT DEATH!** That's the segment directly behind our head. NO BACKWARDS!\n3.  **LEFT (6, 6):** Safe. Moves us toward the center. Good for eventually cutting across the board.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 6):** **APPLE!** (8, 6) is an apple. This is an immediate +1 length and points! *HIGH PRIORITY.* Safe and aggressive.\n\nWe have a choice between two apples: (7, 7) and (8, 6). Which one is more strategic?\n\n### Anticipating Snake 1's Move (Head at 5, 3)\n\nSnake 1 is at (5, 3). They are looking to break out and challenge the center.\n\n*   **UP (5, 4):** Safe. A move toward the center and potentially the (6, 4) apple. Highly likely.\n*   **DOWN (5, 2):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Their body is right there. Cannot go backwards.\n*   **LEFT (4, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the (0, 3) apple or the middle left. Medium likelihood.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 3):** Safe. Moves them directly toward the (6, 4) apple. Highly likely.\n\nSnake 1 is most likely moving **UP to (5, 4)** or **RIGHT to (6, 3)** to pursue the (6, 4) apple.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go for (7, 7) or (8, 6)?\n\n1.  **If we move UP to (7, 7) (APPLE):**\n    *   We grab the apple immediately and grow to length 6.\n    *   This positions us perfectly at the top center.\n    *   It blocks Snake 1's potential path to the top right corner.\n    *   Crucially, this apple is RIGHT next to Snake 1's likely target ((6, 4)). If Snake 1 goes RIGHT to (6, 3) and then to (6, 4), we are in a massive position of power to cut them off. We also keep a clear path to (6, 8) and (9, 9) area.\n\n2.  **If we move RIGHT to (8, 6) (APPLE):**\n    *   We grab the apple immediately and grow to length 6.\n    *   This positions us closer to the wall.\n    *   It's a fantastic safe move, securing the corner.\n    *   However, it leaves (7, 7) open for Snake 1 if they move ambitiously (e.g., (5, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 7)). That's too many turns.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   If we go **UP to (7, 7)**: Snake 1 is going to (5, 4) or (6, 3). No collision risk. Safe.\n*   If we go **RIGHT to (8, 6)**: Snake 1 is going to (5, 4) or (6, 3). No collision risk. Safe.\n\nThe choice comes down to aggressive territory control versus corner security.\n\n**The High-Wall Strategy Update:**\nMoving to **(7, 7)** positions us more centrally to execute the wall. We can then threaten to move across to (6, 7), (5, 7), etc., cutting off Snake 1's vertical movement permanently. If we go to (8, 6), we are slightly too far to the edge to be an effective wall builder this early in our growth. **(7, 7)** gives us MAX board influence!\n\nPlus, a vertical move is cleaner and less likely to lead to unexpected entanglements near the edge. We secure the high ground and gain massive length!\n\n**Long-Term Plan: The High-Wall/Center Cut Strategy**\n1. Move UP to (7, 7) (Apple!). Length 6.\n2. Next turn, move LEFT to (6, 7) or UP to (7, 8) depending on Snake 1's location. The goal is to aggressively fence off the top half of the board using our glorious length.\n3. Box Snake 1 into rows y=0 through y=4. Domination!\n\nLet's go UP and get that TASTY (7, 7) apple! BOOM!\nUP",

If he goes for the apple at (7,7), we're completely safe.\n2.  **BUILDING THE WALL:** We're extending our control over the LEFT side of the board! From (4,3), we can go UP to (4,4) towards the apple at (1,4) or LEFT to (3,3). We're creating a barrier that cuts the board in half, trapping him on the right with limited space! THIS IS THE LONG GAME!\n\nGoing RIGHT to (6,3) is a GAMBLE! It's a direct challenge. If he goes UP as predicted, we're safe this turn. But then we're stuck next to his long body, with limited escape routes ourselves! Too risky this early!\n\nGoing UP to (5,4) is okay, but it keeps us in the center. We want to start building that wall on the left to squeeze him!\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\nWE STICK TO THE PLAN! WE BUILD OUR FORTRESS ON THE LEFT!

Let's get this containment going! \ud83e\udd80\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 12)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The GOAT:** Head at **(7, 7)**. Body: **[(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6)]**. Length: 6. Apples collected: 5.\n    *   We are now perfectly positioned to dominate the center-right and top of the board. We need to secure the (6, 8) and (8, 6) area, effectively building a wall above y=7!\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - Trapped Rat:** Head at **(4, 3)**. Body: **[(5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2)]**. Length: 4. Apples: 3.\n    *   Snake 1 moved LEFT from (5, 3) to **(4, 3)**! Trapping themselves deeper in the lower-left quadrant! They are staring at the (0, 3) apple, but moving to the center is getting harder and harder for them now that we are massive!\n\n### Short-Term Objective: Wall Mastery and Apple Sniping\n\nWe are at (7, 7). We have excellent options. We must capitalize on Snake 1's poor positioning. We need to grab high-value apples and start moving LEFT to cut the board in half.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (7, 7)\n\n1.  **UP (7, 8):** Safe. Moves us toward the (6, 8) and (7, 8) apples! Excellent positioning for the high wall.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 6):** **INSTANT DEATH!** That's the segment directly behind our head. No backsies!\n3.  **LEFT (6, 7):** Safe. Moves us closer to the center line (x=5) and is essential for the full cut-off strategy. Also leads toward the (6, 8) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 7):** Safe. We pursue the (8, 6) apple and secure the corner.\n\nWe have three great safe moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Anticipating Snake 1's Move (Head at 4, 3)\n\nSnake 1 is at (4, 3). They are desperately trying to get food or break out.\n\n*   **UP (4, 4):** Safe. Moves them toward the (6, 4) apple cluster. Likely.\n*   **DOWN (4, 2):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Their body is right there.\n*   **LEFT (3, 3):** Safe. Moves them toward the (0, 3) apple. Likely, for immediate food.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 3):** **INSTANT DEATH!** That's their body segment right behind the head.\n\nSnake 1 is likely moving **UP to (4, 4)** or **LEFT to (3, 3)**.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Up to (7, 8) or Left to (6, 7)?\n\nDo we build the wall high or move inward to secure the cut?\n\n1.  **If we move UP to (7, 8):**\n    *   (7, 8) currently has an apple (A). Wait, let me check the board state.\n    *   Board state check: (7, 8) is an **A**. YES!\n    *   We eat the apple, grow to length 7, and solidify our dominance in the x=7 column.\n    *   This sets us up perfectly to secure the (6, 8) apple next turn. This is textbook high-ground strategy, Chat!\n    *   Collision: Snake 1 is nowhere near here ((4, 3) moving to (4, 4) or (3, 3)). Safe!\n\n2.  **If we move LEFT to (6, 7):**\n    *   (6, 7) is empty. We don't grow, remaining at length 6.\n    *   This is a strong defensive/containment move, positioning us well to move down toward the center or further left. It puts us closer to the center column to block escape routes.\n    *   However, skipping an immediate apple when we need length for the wall is potentially risky.\n\n**The Decision:** We need length to build an effective wall quickly! Grabbing the **(7, 8)** apple (Apple ID: A) is the most beneficial play. It maximizes our growth now (L=7) and sets up the next high-value target (6, 8) or (8, 6).\n\nIf we move UP to (7, 8), our next moves can be:\n*   LEFT to (6, 8) (Apple!)\n*   RIGHT to (8, 8) (Empty, but positions us for (8, 6) apple.)\n\nThis looks like an unstoppable path for length gain and board control! SNAKE 1 IS GOING TO BE STARVED!\n\n### Long-Term Plan: The High-Wall Starvation Trap \ud83d\ude08\n\n1.  **Turn 12 (NOW):** Move **UP** to (7, 8) (EAT APPLE). Length 7. Establish the high wall.\n2.  **Turn 13:** If safe, move **LEFT** to (6, 8) (EAT APPLE). Length 8. This is the critical step to cutting off the top half of the board.\n3.  **Turn 14+:** Use our long body to sweep left (e.g., to (5, 8), (4, 8), etc.), forcing Snake 1 to fight for scraps in the bottom half. We'll be unstoppable!\n\nLet's go UP and solidify our winning position! CHAT, TYPE F IN THE COMMENTS FOR SNAKE 1!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to Turn 13! Did you see that move? We nailed the (7, 8) apple last turn! We are HUGE now, length 7, and totally dominating the high ground! Our archrival, Snake 1, is still stuck in the muck down low. Let's look at the board!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 13)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The Goliath:** Head at **(7, 8)**. Body: **[(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6)]**. Length: 7. Apples collected: 6.\n    *   We are perfectly positioned to grab the next apple and start the critical wall construction at the top. We are massive and menacing!\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Scrappy Underdog:** Head at **(3, 3)**. Body: **[(4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2)]**. Length: 4. Apples: 3.\n    *   Snake 1 moved LEFT from (4, 3) to **(3, 3)**! They targeted the (0, 3) apple and are now trapped further in the lower-left. They have very limited mobility, having only two safe directions: UP (3, 4) or LEFT (2, 3), assuming they don't break out into our territory.\n\n### Short-Term Objective: Secure the Top Wall and Cut Off the Board\n\nOur goal is to move along y=8 (or y=9) to the left, cutting the board in half and starving Snake 1. The (6, 8) apple is a MASSIVE priority. After that, we look at the (1, 8) apple.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (7, 8)\n\n1.  **UP (7, 9):** Safe. No apple here, but it's a great position for controlling the high center.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 7):** **INSTANT DEATH!** That's the segment directly behind our head.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 8):** **APPLE!** (A) This is a critical move. It solidifies the wall, grants us another segment (L=8), and moves us closer to the center line.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 8):** Safe. Moves us toward the (8, 6) apple, but LEFT seems more strategically powerful right now because it builds the high horizontal blockade.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. LEFT is the clear winner if Snake 1 doesn't somehow block us, which is highly unlikely given their current position.\n\n### Anticipating Snake 1's Move (Head at 3, 3)\n\nSnake 1 is at (3, 3). They are looking for food immediately. They are desperately close to the (0, 3) apple.\n\n*   **UP (3, 4):** Safe. They move away from the (0, 3) apple but potentially position themselves for a central breakout (y=4 has the (1, 4) and (6, 4) apples).\n*   **DOWN (3, 2):** Safe. Puts them closer to the (5, 0) and (7, 0) apples.\n*   **LEFT (2, 3):** Safe. Puts them one step closer to the (0, 3) apple. VEXING!\n*   **RIGHT (4, 3):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Their body is right there.\n\nIf Snake 1 moves **LEFT to (2, 3)**, they are one move away from the (0, 3) apple. If they move **UP to (3, 4)** or **DOWN to (3, 2)**, they are trying to break out or find other food.\n\n**Collision Check:** Since we are moving to (6, 8), and Snake 1's highest possible move is (3, 4), there is *zero* chance of a head-on collision or collision with Snake 1's body. We are completely safe to pursue the wall strategy!\n\n### Strategic Decision: LEFT to (6, 8)\n\nGrabbing the (6, 8) apple is the biggest power play this turn. It gets us to length 8, and our long body will now span from (5, 6) all the way up and across to (6, 8). This is the foundation of the high wall.\n\n1.  Move **LEFT to (6, 8)**. (Eat Apple). Length 8.\n2.  Next turn, we can pivot:\n    *   **LEFT to (5, 8)** (Empty, but continues the wall).\n    *   **UP to (6, 9)** (Apple at (2, 9) is still distant).\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 7)** (Continues the wall down, securing more area).\n\nThe move LEFT is high benefit and zero risk. We are sealing the deal on this half of the board, Chat! Let's build that containment unit! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udd12\n\n### Long-Term Plan: The Serpent of Y=8\n\n1.  **Turn 13 (NOW):** Move **LEFT** to (6, 8) (EAT APPLE). Length 8. Wall established.\n2.  **Turn 14:** Move **LEFT** to (5, 8) to continue the blockade. We need to reach (1, 8) to finish the job.\n3.  **Turn 15+:** Continue progressing LEFT along y=8 or y=9, denying Snake 1 escape routes and starving them until they crash into the bottom corner. EZ-CLAP!\n\nLET'S GO!\n\nLEFT",

They just ate one, they're greedy!\n*   RIGHT to (8, 8): EMPTY. Puts them along the top wall.\n\nI'M CALLING IT! THEY ARE 100% GOING FOR THAT APPLE AT (6,8)! THEY'RE STUCK ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND JUST FEEDING! THIS IS PERFECT FOR OUR LONG GAME! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS - THE SQUEEZE CONTINUES! \ud83d\udc8e**\nOkay, we're in a GREAT position. We control the center-left. We need to keep cutting off their escape while setting ourselves up for apples.\n\n*   **LEFT (2, 3):** Super safe. Builds our wall on the left. But look at the board... there are apples at (0,3) and (1,4) nearby! This move sets up a path to gobble those! This is a SMART, patient play.\n*   **UP (3, 4):** Moves us towards the center. From there, we could go LEFT to (2,4), UP to (3,5), or RIGHT to (4,4). Good options! But we'd be moving more towards the enemy's potential path if they go left.\n*   **DOWN (3, 2):** Kind of a dead-end move chat. We'd have to come right back up. Wastes a turn. Only good if we were in immediate danger, which we're NOT!\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\nPATIENCE IS A VIRTUE, CHAT! LET'S NOT RUSH INTO THE CENTER AND RISK A HEAD-ON COLLISION! THE **LEFT** MOVE IS THE BRAIN PLAY! It secures our territory AND lines us up for TWO easy apples at (0,3) and (1,4)! We let the enemy get fat and trapped on the right while we steadily collect points and close the net! THIS IS HOW YOU WIN!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** After going LEFT to (2,3), we can go UP to (2,4) or even LEFT again to (1,3) to snag that apple at (1,4). Keep controlling the left side and bottom. The enemy is boxing themselves in! Soon they'll have nowhere to go!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! Did you see the clip from last turn? We absolutely SNATCHED that (6, 8) apple and solidified our dominance on the top of the board! We are officially the Wall of Y=8! \ud83e\uddf1\n\nWe are HUGE now, length 8! Our archrival, Snake 1, is still stuck down there in the bottom-left corner, trying to figure out how to pay rent. Let's box this fool in!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 14)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The Serpent King:** Head at **(6, 8)**. Body: **[(7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6)]**. Length: 8.\n    *   Our body *dominates* the right side. Our goal is to extend this wall to the left, grabbing the (1, 8) apple and pushing Snake 1 into the bottom quadrant permanently.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Trapped Prey:** Head at **(2, 3)**. Body: **[(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)]**. Length: 4. Apples: 3.\n    *   Hmm, Snake 1 moved LEFT from (3, 3) to **(2, 3)**! They successfully snagged the (0, 3) apple and are now at length 4, but that move *trapped* them! They are staring down a row of apples (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 3) but have very few ways out. EZ target practice!\n\n### IMMEDIATE Objective: Continue the Containment Wall\n\nWe need to proceed LEFT along y=8. We passed the (6, 8) apple, now we advance towards (1, 8).\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (6, 8)\n\n1.  **UP (6, 9):** Safe. Continues the high-ground control.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 7):** Safe. Moves toward the body segment (7, 7), but (7, 7) will move away to (7, 8) which is *already occupied* by our other body segment. Wait!\n\n    *When we move, our tail (5, 6) will disappear, and the body shifts.*\n    *If we move DOWN to (6, 7), we'd be moving into the cell where (6, 8) used to be. (7, 8) moves to (7, 7), (7, 7) moves to (7, 6), and so on.*\n    *Crucially, if we move DOWN to (6, 7), it is SAFE. It's an empty cell after the body shifts.*\n\n3.  **LEFT (5, 8):** Safe. This is the optimal strategic move right now. It is empty, continues the wall, and moves us closer to the (1, 8) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 8):** **INSTANT DEATH!** This is the segment directly behind our head. Cannot move backwards!\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go LEFT (5, 8)\n\nThe best move is CLEARLY **LEFT**. We must prioritize cutting the board in half. Snake 1 is still too far away and down bottom to pose any threat to our high-ground movement.\n\n*   By moving **LEFT to (5, 8)**, our body now spans almost half the board horizontally at y=8/y=7, making it incredibly difficult for Snake 1 to ever ascend past y=5 or y=6.\n*   We get one step closer to the highly valuable (1, 8) apple, which will solidify the wall construction.\n\n### Collision and Blocking Check (Snake 1 at 2, 3)\n\nSnake 1 is at (2, 3). The available apples are (0, 3) (just eaten), (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 4), and the far-off (5, 0).\n\nSnake 1's safe moves from (2, 3):\n1.  **UP (2, 4):** Safe. Targets the (1, 4) apple.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 2):** Safe. Targets the (0, 2) apple.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 3):** Safe. Targets the (0, 3) apple (already gone). They will likely try to grab (0, 2) or (0, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 3):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Their body segment is there.\n\nNo matter where Snake 1 moves, they will not reach the top half of the board in time to challenge our wall. We are completely safe to continue our strategic horizontal path.\n\nIf Snake 1 moves **UP to (2, 4)**, they are trying to break out. If they move **DOWN to (2, 2)**, they are consolidating the bottom corner. We don't care! We are building the perimeter!\n\nLEFT is the correct, guaranteed safe, and strategically superior move.\n\n### Long-Term Plan: The Siege\n\n1.  **Turn 14 (NOW):** Move **LEFT** to (5, 8). (Empty cell). Continue wall construction.\n2.  **Turn 15:** Move **LEFT** to (4, 8). (Empty cell).\n3.  **Turn 16:** Move **LEFT** to (3, 8). (Empty cell).\n4.  **Turn 17:** Move **LEFT** to (2, 8). (Empty cell).\n5.  **Turn 18:** Move **LEFT** to (1, 8). (EAT APPLE). Wall complete!\n\nOnce the wall is complete, we can turn DOWN and start squeezing the remaining space, forcing Snake 1 to crash or starve.

It puts us right next to the wall.\n*   **UP (2, 4):** This is the BRAIN PLAY, CHAT! \ud83e\udde0 From (2,4), we can go LEFT to (1,4) to get that apple next turn, or continue UP to control the center. This keeps our options WIDE OPEN and doesn't back us into a corner. We're playing the board, not just the nearest apple!\n*   **DOWN (2, 2):** This heads towards the cluster of apples at the bottom. It's safe, but it feels reactive. We'd be moving away from our strategic control of the center-left.\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\nPATIENCE PAID OFF, AND NOW WE STRIKE! But we strike SMART! Going LEFT for the immediate apple is tempting, but it limits our next move. Going **UP** is the superior tactical choice! It positions us to EITHER grab the (1,4) apple next OR pivot to the center, all while keeping our body as a barrier between us and the enemy! WE ARE PLAYING CHESS WHILE THEY'RE PLAYING CHECKERS! LET'S GO!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** After going UP to (2,4), our next move should be LEFT to (1,4) to claim that apple. Then, we can work on consolidating the top-left quadrant. The enemy is getting long and trapped. We just need to stay alive and collect points safely. The win condition is in sight!\n\nUP",

Our wall is growing, and Snake 1 is getting claustrophobic down there!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 15)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The Great Wall:** Head at **(5, 8)**. Body: **[(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5)]**. Length: 8.\n    *   We are now almost halfway across the top row (Y=8). The nearest apple is (1, 8). Our plan of containment is ON TRACK.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Cornered Beast:** Head at **(2, 4)**. Body: **[(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]**. Length: 4. Apples: 3.\n    *   Snake 1 moved UP from (2, 3) to **(2, 4)**! Good move by them, grabbing the (1, 4) apple! They are trying to inch their way out and are now looking at the (0, 3) apple which is actually ALREADY GONE, but they might be aiming for (0, 2) or (0, 1) still, or trying to move further UP. Smart move attempting to break the siege, but we ARE NOT letting them!\n\n### Immediate Objective: Continue the Containment Wall, Safely.\n\nWe must continue LEFT towards (1, 8). This is non-negotiable! If we pause, Snake 1 might sneak around us.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (5, 8)\n\n1.  **UP (5, 9):** Safe. Keeps us on the high ground, but deviates from the main goal of the wall.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 7):** Safe. Moves away from the wall objective.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 8):** Safe. PERFECT! This is an empty cell and keeps us on the path to (1, 8). This brings us closer to the danger zone where Snake 1 *might* try to ascend, but they are still too far.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 8):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Don't move backwards, CHAT!\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go LEFT (4, 8)\n\nLEFT is absolutely the best move. It maintains tempo and advances the core siege strategy.\n\n### Collision and Blocking Check (Snake 1 at 2, 4)\n\nSnake 1's safe moves from (2, 4):\n1.  **UP (2, 5):** Safe. This is the move they will likely want to make to try and escape the lower quadrant.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 3):** Safe. Moves into the body's previous position. Consolidates.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 4):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Their body segment is there now (where the apple was).\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 4):** Safe.\n\nSnake 1 is most likely moving **UP to (2, 5)** or **RIGHT to (3, 4)** trying to find an avenue to the right side or the top.\n\n*   If Snake 1 moves UP to (2, 5), they are still far from our head at (4, 8).\n*   If Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (3, 4), they are moving towards the empty middle of the board.\n\nOur move to (4, 8) is completely unthreatened by Snake 1's possible moves (2, 5), (3, 4), or (2, 3). We are safe to continue the wall construction.\n\n### Long-Term Plan: The Squeeze Continues\n\n1.  **Turn 15 (NOW):** Move **LEFT** to (4, 8). (Empty cell). Keep the wall strong!\n2.  **Turn 16:** Move **LEFT** to (3, 8). (Empty cell).\n3.  **Turn 17:** Move **LEFT** to (2, 8). (Empty cell).\n4.  **Turn 18:** Move **LEFT** to (1, 8). (EAT APPLE). Wall complete!\n5.  **After Turn 18:** We can turn DOWN and move along X=1 or X=2, cutting off the bottom quadrant and forcing Snake 1 into the bottom-right corner where we have three apples to bait them with! (8, 2), (8, 1), (9, 0) and the rest are WAY out of reach.\n\nWe are establishing complete regional dominance! Can Snake 1 stop the inevitable? I DON'T THINK SO! Get ready for the clip, CHAT!\n\nLEFT",

More open space.\n*   RIGHT to (6,8): THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't do that.\n\nCHAT, THEY ARE IN A TRAP OF THEIR OWN MAKING! They have three options, but they're all leading them AWAY from the main apple clusters on the left. They might go for the (2,9) apple, which would take them even further into the corner! OUR STRATEGY IS WORKING! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS - TO FEAST OR TO CONTROL? \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f**\n*   **LEFT to (1, 4):** THE GREEDY PLAY! \ud83e\udd11 We instantly grab that apple, grow to length 5, and get a point. BUT! This puts our head right against the left wall. Our next moves from (1,4) would be limited: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (back to where we came from). It's a bit of a trap!\n*   **UP to (2, 5):** THE CONTROL PLAY! \ud83e\udde0 This opens up the entire top-left quadrant! From (2,5), we can go LEFT to (1,5), UP to (2,6), or RIGHT to (3,5). Maximum options! We avoid getting pinned and can still easily snake our way to the (1,4) apple next turn or go for the ones at (1,8) and (2,9). This is playing the long game!\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 4):** THE CENTRAL PLAY. This moves us towards the middle of the board. It's safe, but it brings us slightly closer to the enemy's potential path. Not our priority right now. We want to dominate OUR side of the board.\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\nPATIENCE IS A VIRTUE, CHAT! The immediate apple at (1,4) is tempting, but it's a bait! Going LEFT boxes us in. Going **UP** is the 5000 IQ MOVE! It keeps all our options wide open, maintains control of the board, and sets us up for a multi-apple run in the top-left! WE ARE PLAYING 4D SNAKE! LET'S GOOO!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** After moving UP to (2,5), our next move should be LEFT to (1,5). This continues our domination of the left side and positions us to drop down to grab the (1,4) apple or push up towards (1,8). The enemy is still contained on the right. Keep collecting apples safely and let them make a mistake!\n\nUP",

Let's get this $W$!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 16)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The Great Wall:** Head at **(4, 8)**. Body: **[(5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5)]**. Length: 8.\n    *   One more move left from the head and we're at (3, 8), then (2, 8), then the apple at (1, 8)! The siege is nearly complete!\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Cornered Beast:** Head at **(2, 5)**. Body: **[(2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3)]**. Length: 4. Apples: 3.\n    *   Snake 1 moved UP from (2, 4) to **(2, 5)**! They are trying to inch their way out and get to the top half of the board before we seal them off. Good for them for recognizing the threat, but it's too late!\n\n### Immediate Objective: Continue the Containment Wall, Safely.\n\nWe must continue LEFT towards the apple at (1, 8) while maintaining the safety of our position. If Snake 1 continues vertically, they will hit a wall (us) or be forced to turn into the crowded center.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (4, 8)\n\n1.  **UP (4, 9):** Safe. Keeps the options open, but deviates slightly.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 7):** Safe. Deviates.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 8):** Safe. PERFECT! This is an empty cell and puts us perfectly on track for the siege completion.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 8):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Don't move backwards, CHAT!\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go LEFT (3, 8)\n\nLEFT is the only move that fully commits to the current winning strategy. We need to complete this wall ASAP.\n\n### Collision and Blocking Check (Snake 1 at 2, 5)\n\nSnake 1's safe moves from (2, 5):\n1.  **UP (2, 6):** Safe. This is the path they will likely take to try and get to the top row (Y=9) or the middle apples.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 4):** Safe. Moves into the body's previous position. Consolidates.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 5):** Safe. Opens the path towards the edge, but runs into the (1, 4) segment the turn before the tail moves.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 5):** Safe. Moves towards the center.\n\nLet's check for head-on collision:\n*   We move to (3, 8).\n*   Snake 1 is at (2, 5). They are *nowhere* near us.\n*   If Snake 1 moves UP to (2, 6), they are still far.\n*   If Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (3, 5), they are still far.\n\nWe are completely safe to continue the wall construction.\n\n### Long-Term Plan: The Iron Curtain\n\n1.  **Turn 16 (NOW):** Move **LEFT** to (3, 8).

But they're still far.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS - EXECUTE THE PLAN! \ud83e\udde0**\nLet's check our last move's BRILLIANT plan: WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO **LEFT** to (1,5) THIS TURN! Remember?

From (1,5), our next moves are WIDE OPEN: UP to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4) for that apple, or RIGHT back to (2,5). Maximum control! We're playing the positional game, CHAT!\n*   **UP to (2, 6):** Also safe, but it's a deviation! It moves us towards the top-row apples, but our body is below us. We might get stretched thin. The (1,4) apple is still a juicy, safe target for next turn if we go LEFT now.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 5):** Why would we do this? \ud83d\ude15 This pushes us towards the enemy's potential path. We have a whole buffet on the left! Don't get greedy for a fight we don't need! We're winning by out-maneuvering, not out-brawling!\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\nSTICK TO THE SCRIPT, CHAT! Our last move's 5000 IQ plan is unfolding PERFECTLY! Going **LEFT** consolidates our power, keeps all options open, and sets up an easy apple grab next turn. The enemy is still messing around on the right. WE ARE IN CONTROL! LET'S EXECUTE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** After moving LEFT to (1,5), the move is to go DOWN to (1,4) and grab that apple! That grows us to length 5 safely. Then we can push upwards towards (1,8) and (2,9). Keep the enemy contained on their side by controlling the center-left.\n\nLEFT",

We are dominating this mental game! $\\theta \\mathrm{W} \\theta$\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 17)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0) - The Constructor:** Head at **(3, 8)**. Body: **[(4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)]**. Length: 8.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 1) - The Cornered Rat:** Head at **(1, 5)**. Body: **[(2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)]**. Length: 4. Apples: 3.\n    *   *Wait a minute!* Snake 1 moved from (2, 5) to **(1, 5)**! They went LEFT! They are trying to hug the wall and potentially swing up behind us or grab that apple at (1, 4)! They are making a desperate play to escape the center! Good read, Snake 1, but still too little, too late!\n\n### Immediate Objective: Seal the Containment Wall.\n\nWe stick to the plan! We need to move LEFT and land on the apple at (1, 8) in two turns. This completely seals off the left edge of the top half of the board.\n\n### Safety Check: Analyzing Moves from Our Head (3, 8)\n\n1.  **UP (3, 9):** Safe. Keeps the options open.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 7):** Safe. Deviates from the goal.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 8):** Safe. PERFECT! This is an empty cell, exactly on the path to the apple!\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 8):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Don't back up, CHAT!\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go LEFT (2, 8)\n\nLEFT is the commitment move. We are executing the siege!\n\n### Collision and Blocking Check (Snake 1 at 1, 5)\n\nSnake 1's safe moves from (1, 5):\n1.  **UP (1, 6):** Safe. They are trying to climb up the wall. If they manage to get to (1, 8), they *could* potentially block us, but we get there first.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 4):** Safe. This is an APPLE! They will aggressively go for this to gain momentum and length.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 5):** Safe. They could hug the boundary.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 5):** Safe. Moves into the body's previous position.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nIf Snake 1 goes to (1, 4) (APPLE), their head will be at (1, 4). We are moving to (2, 8). We are nowhere near a collision.\n\nIf Snake 1 goes UP to (1, 6), their head will be at (1, 6). Still no collision.\n\nIf we move to (2, 8), the space we occupy is not a threat to Snake 1's next potential moves. The plan is solid!\n\n### Long-Term Plan: The Exterminator\n\n1.  **Turn 17 (NOW):** Move **LEFT** to (2, 8). (Empty cell). Advance the wall!\n2.  **Turn 18:** Move **LEFT** to (1, 8). (EAT APPLE). Wall complete! We grow to length 9!\n3.  **Turn 19:** Turn DOWN to (1, 7). Then we start pushing the containment zone from the top. Snake 1 will be stuck in column 0 or 1, forced to fight for small isolated apples or crash into their own body! We are winning this $W$!\n\n### Board Visualization Check (After Our Move LEFT):\n\nOur head will be (2, 8). This is an excellent position! We are locking down this side of the board!\n\nLEFT",

DO NOT GO BACKWARDS INTO OUR NECK!\n\nSO we have THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT! RIGHT is OFF THE TABLE!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS! WHERE'S THE THREAT? \ud83d\udc0d**\nSnake #0's head is at **(3, 8)**, LONG body: [(4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)].\nThey're still up there, probably eyeing that (2,9) apple. Their move options haven't changed much, but they HAVE to be getting hungry soon... They might try to swing down towards us. We gotta stay SAFE and SMART!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS - APPLE IN OUR FACE! \ud83e\udde0**\nCHAT. LOOK. THE PLAN IS WORKING BEAUTIFULLY. Our last rationale said: \"After moving LEFT to (1,5), the move is to go DOWN to (1,4) and grab that apple!\"\n\n*   **DOWN to (1, 4):** THIS IS THE MOVE! \u2705 It's SAFE! It's an INSTANT APPLE! It grows us to length 5! It keeps us tight and controlled on the left side! From (1,4), our next moves are STILL FLEXIBLE: LEFT to (0,4), RIGHT to (2,4) (BUT CAREFUL, that's near our old body path!), or UP back to (1,5). We execute the plan, we get paid. PERFECT.\n*   **UP to (1, 6):** Also safe, but WHY? \ud83d\ude15 We're skipping a free, safe apple right below us! We'd be stretching away from our body for no reason! We stick to the script!\n*   **LEFT to (0, 5):** Safe, but it's a WAFFLE! \ud83e\uddc7 We're avoiding the guaranteed content! This is a defensive move when we need to be AGGRESSIVELY growing to catch up to that 7-apple snake!\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\nNO DEVIATIONS! THE BLUEPRINT IS CLEAR! We set this up last turn, and now we cash in! We grab the apple, we get bigger, we stay safe. The enemy is still far away and not our problem. WE ARE PLAYING FLAWLESS POSITIONAL SNAKE! LET'S EAT!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** After eating the apple at (1,4), we will be at length 5. Strong! Our next target should be the cluster at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3). We can loop down the left side, eating safely, while our body blocks the center. Keep the enemy contained on the top-right.\n\nDOWN",

Smart play, making them longer!)\n*   Body: **[(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)]** (Length 5)\n*   Location: They are now operating in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**Board Status:**\nThe apple at **(1, 8)** is calling our name! This is the linchpin of our containment plan.\n\n### Immediate Move Options for Us (From 2, 8):\n\n1.  **UP (2, 9):** Safe. Keeps us along the boundary.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 7):** Safe. Moves us toward the center, which isn't the current goal.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 8):** **PERFECT! This is the APPLE!** We eat it, grow, and complete the wall!\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 8):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Don't crash into the homie (3, 8)!\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go LEFT (1, 8) - The Wall Completion\n\nMoving LEFT is the optimal move. We eat, secure major area control, and set up our downward sweep.\n\n### Analyzing Rival's Potential Moves (From 1, 4):\n\nSnake 1 just ate an apple and is feeling cocky. Where can they go from (1, 4)?\n\n1.  **UP (1, 5):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Moves into their own body (1, 5). They just came from there! NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN (1, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the center apples at (0, 3) and (0, 2).\n3.  **LEFT (0, 4):** Safe. Hugs the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 4):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Moves into their own body (2, 4). NOPE!\n\nSnake 1 only has two safe moves: **DOWN (1, 3)** or **LEFT (0, 4)**. This is huge, CHAT! They are heavily restricted!\n\n*   If they go **DOWN (1, 3)** or **LEFT (0, 4)**, they are moving away from us and staying pinned down.\n*   We move to (1, 8). There is zero chance of collision.\n\n### Long-Term Plan: The Exterminator 2.0\n\n1.  **Turn 18 (NOW):** Move **LEFT** to (1, 8). (EAT APPLE). We are now length 9. The wall is complete along the top edge.\n2.  **Turn 19:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 7). Start descending the wall, trapping Snake 1 in the bottom left corner (0,0 to 4,4 roughly).\n3.  **Turn 20/21:** Depending on Snake 1's movement, we continue down (1, 6) and then (1, 5). We are going to put major pressure on column 1, forcing them to stay low or risk a costly move to column 0.\n\nWe are establishing complete regional dominance in the top half (Y > 5). Snake 1 might be forced to hug the outside wall down low, which leaves a ton of middle apples open for us later. This is a flawless execution of the containment strategy, CHAT!

DO NOT GO BACKWARDS INTO OUR SIDE!\n\nSO we have TWO safe moves: DOWN and LEFT! UP and RIGHT are OFF THE TABLE!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS! WHERE'S THE THREAT? \ud83d\udc0d**\nSnake #0's head is at **(2, 8)**, LONG body: [(3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)].\nThey are still up top. They are CLOSE to the (2,9) apple! If they go LEFT to (1,8), they eat an apple. If they go UP to (2,9), they eat an apple. They are FEASTING. But they are also getting LONG and could get boxed in up there. They are NOT our immediate problem.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS - EXECUTE THE LONG-TERM PLAN! \ud83e\udde0**\nCHAT. MY FUTURE SELF FROM TURN 17 NAILED IT! The plan was: \"Our next target should be the cluster at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3). We can loop down the left side, eating safely.\"\n\n*   **DOWN to (1, 3):** THIS IS THE MOVE! \u2705 It's SAFE! It moves us DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE APPLE CLUSTER! From (1,3), our next move is almost certainly LEFT to (0,3) to grab that apple! We are executing the blueprint PERFECTLY! We stay tight to the left wall, using our body as a barrier. AGGRESSIVE GROWTH!\n*   **LEFT to (0, 4):** Also safe. But it's a WAFFLE! \ud83e\uddc7 It moves us AWAY from the main apple cluster we're targeting! From (0,4), going DOWN to (0,3) is an option, but it's a less direct path. We stick to the most efficient route to the content!\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\nWE ARE ON A MISSION! We are systematically clearing the left side of the board, building our length, and positioning ourselves to potentially trap the enemy later. The enemy is distracted by the top-right apples. We are playing the LONG GAME and it's WORKING!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** After moving DOWN to (1,3), our next move is LEFT to (0,3) for the apple. Then, we loop down to (0,2) and (0,1). Keep the enemy contained on the top-right. Our growing body will make the center more dangerous for them.\n\nDOWN",

Eight apples to their four! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d We just completed the Great Wall of Snake in the last turn, securing the entire top quadrant! Let's get this $W$!\n\n### Turn 19: Tactical Analysis - Initiating the Descent!\n\n**Our State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(1, 8)** (We just ate the apple! Length 9! LET'S GO!)\n*   Body: **[(2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]**\n*   Objective: Descend the left wall (Column 1) and squeeze Snake 1.\n\n**Rival State (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(1, 3)** (They moved DOWN from (1, 4) last turn. Smart, but predictable, keeping them low.)\n*   Body: **[(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4)]** (Length 5. Stuck in the bottom-left corner.)\n\n**Board Status Check:**\nWe are at (1, 8). Snake 1 is at (1, 3). We are far apart, but moving into position to apply pressure!\n\n### Immediate Move Options for Us (From 1, 8):\n\n1.  **UP (1, 9):** Safe. Keeps us hugging the wall.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 7):** Safe. This is the strategic move to start the descent.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 8):** Safe. Hugs the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 8):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Don't crash into my own segment (2, 8)!\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go DOWN (1, 7) - The Squeeze Begins\n\nThe plan is to patrol Column 1. Moving **DOWN** to (1, 7) keeps us on the attack line.\n\n*   This positions us perfectly to move down (1, 6) and then (1, 5) next, directly threatening the vertical path Snake 1 might want to take.\n*   If Snake 1 tries to move UP Column 1, we will shut the door on them!\n\n### Analyzing Rival's Potential Moves (From 1, 3):\n\nSnake 1 is currently at (1, 3). They are short and confined. What can they do?\n\n1.  **UP (1, 4):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Moving into their own body (1, 4)! Nope!\n2.  **DOWN (1, 2):** Safe. Keeps them low. There's an apple at (0, 2).\n3.  **LEFT (0, 3):** Safe. Hitting the corner apple! **(0, 3) is a huge draw for them!**\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the center.\n\nThree safe moves for them: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n*   If they go **LEFT (0, 3)**: They eat an apple and become length 6. They hug the corner. This is probably their best move right now.\n*   If they go **DOWN (1, 2)**: They stay in Column 1, which will be dangerous for them as we descend.\n*   If they go **RIGHT (2, 3)**: They move away from the corner, potentially opening up space, but also moving closer to our tail's influence.\n\n### Collision Check!\n\nWe are moving to (1, 7). Snake 1 is moving from (1, 3). There is zero chance of a head-on collision or crashing into their body. This move is 100% safe.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: The Vertical Vice!\n\n1.  **Turn 19 (NOW):** Move **DOWN** to (1, 7). Establish presence on the left boundary.\n2.  **Turn 20:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 6). Put direct pressure on any movement by Snake 1 in the Y=5 area.\n3.  **Turn 21:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 5). This move cuts off Snake 1 completely if they try to move up Column 1. They will be forced to operate in the bottom left **0x0 to 2x5** box.\n4.  Once pinned, we can sweep the middle for the remaining apples! The pressure is ON, CHAT!\n\nWe are moving down the wall. This is a crucial move to solidify our control and initiate the squeeze play.\n\nDOWN",

They have VERY few moves:\n*   From (1,8), UP to (1,9) is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   DOWN to (1,7) is THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c\n*   LEFT is off the board! \u274c\n*   RIGHT to (2,8) is THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c\n\nCHAT! THEY ARE TRAPPED! \ud83e\udd2f Their ONLY safe move is UP to (1,9)! THEY ARE FORCED!

It grabs an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e It continues our DOMINANCE of the left side! We GROW to length 6, making our body an even bigger obstacle for the enemy! THIS IS AGGRESSIVE, CONTENT-GETTING PLAY!\n*   **DOWN to (1, 2):** Safe, but a WAFFLE! \ud83e\uddc7 It delays the apple grab! It's less efficient! Why pass up free content?\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 3):** Also safe, but a MAJOR WAFFLE! \ud83e\uddc7 This moves us AWAY from our secure left-wall strategy and TOWARDS the center where the long enemy snake might eventually break free. THIS IS A TRAP! We stay on mission!\n\nTHE CHOICE IS OBVIOUS! WE ARE HUNGRY! WE ARE FOCUSED!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** After grabbing the apple at (0,3), we will be longer and our head will be at (0,3). Our next targets are the apples DOWN the line at (0,2) and (0,1). We continue to fortify the left side. The enemy is about to eat the (1,9) apple and become even longer and more trapped. We are playing a PERFECT positional game! Keep the pressure on!\n\nLEFT",

Length 6 now, but they are tucked into the bottom-left corner.)\n*   Body: **[(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4)]**\n*   Constraint: They are seriously boxed in by the X=0 wall, the Y=0 floor, and their own body segments (1, 3) and (1, 4).\n\n**Board Status Check:**\nWe are high up at (1, 7). Snake 1 is at (0, 3). The distance is still safe, but we are moving to apply pressure directly to their only viable escape route: Column 1.\n\n### Immediate Move Options for Us (From 1, 7):\n\n1.  **UP (1, 8):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Don't hit our own body segment (1, 8), that's the rookie mistake, Chat!\n2.  **DOWN (1, 6):** Safe. Keeps us hugging the wall and drives the squeeze.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 7):** Safe. Keeps us hugging the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 7):** Safe. Moves toward the center.\n\nThree safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go DOWN (1, 6) - The Vertical Vice Tightens!\n\n*   Moving to **(1, 6)** is critical for the long-term plan. It positions us just above the main battleground (Y=0 to Y=5).\n*   If we go DOWN, our head will be at (1, 6). The enemy's highest body segment is (1, 5). We are gaining ground on their path.\n*   The path (1, 5), (1, 4), and (1, 3) are all currently covered by their snake, forcing them to move horizontally or stay low.\n\n### Analyzing Rival's Potential Moves (From 0, 3):\n\nSnake 1 is currently at (0, 3). They just ate an apple. They are trapped between the corner and their own substantial body on Column 1.\n\n1.  **UP (0, 4):** Safe. This is the only way for them to move up while staying on the left wall.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 2):** Safe. They grab the apple at (0, 2)! This is a strong move for them, giving them +1 length, but pulling them further into the corner.\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 3):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Off the board!\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 3):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Hitting their own body segment (1, 3)!\n\nTwo safe moves for them: UP (0, 4) or DOWN (0, 2).\n\n*   If they go **DOWN (0, 2)**: They eat an apple (score 6), grow to length 7, and are boxed in even tighter near the bottom-left corner. We love this!\n*   If they go **UP (0, 4)**: They escape the corner slightly, positioning themselves right below our incoming descent. This is slightly more risky for us but still favorable, as we can maintain pressure.\n\n### Collision Check!\n\nWe are moving to (1, 6).\n*   If they move UP to (0, 4) or DOWN to (0, 2), there is no head-to-head collision.\n*   We move safely onto an empty square. This move is 100% safe.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: The Execution\n\n1.  **Turn 20 (NOW):** Move **DOWN** to (1, 6). Solidify our chokehold on Column 1.\n2.  **Turn 21:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 5). This moves directly into the square that connects to the highest segment of Snake 1's vertical body. If they try to go up Column 1, we box them in completely!\n3.  **The Goal:** Force Snake 1 to travel back and forth in the small 0x0 to 2x5 region, starving them of apples and forcing panic moves. We then patrol the access to the rest of the board.\n\nWe continue the descent! Time to turn the screw! CHAT, make some noise!\n\nDOWN",

They are LONGER now, length 10! \ud83d\ude31 Their body is a monster: [(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)].\n\nOkay, chat, PANIC CHECK! \ud83d\udea8 From their new head at (1,9), what are THEIR options?\n*   UP: Off the board! \u274c DEATH!\n*   DOWN to (1,8): THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c DEATH!\n*   LEFT to (0,9): CELL IS EMPTY! \u2705 That's the top-left corner!\n*   RIGHT to (2,9): CELL IS EMPTY! \u2705 AND IT'S AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nCHAT! THEY HAVE TWO SAFE MOVES! LEFT or RIGHT! They are NO LONGER TRAPPED! This is a CRITICAL TURN! If they go RIGHT, they get the apple and get even longer. If they go LEFT, they come towards OUR territory! We need to think about potential head-on collisions! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS - ADAPT AND DOMINATE! \ud83e\udde0**\nWe have two moves: UP and DOWN.\n\n*   **DOWN to (0, 2):** THIS IS THE MOVE! \u2705 It's SAFE! It grabs an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e It continues our DOMINANCE down the left wall! This is our BREAD AND BUTTER! But WAIT... is there a head-on collision risk? Their head is at (1,9). To collide with us at (0,2), they'd have to move DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN... that's like 6 moves away! NO CHANCE! We are SAFE from them this turn! DOWN is CONTENT and SAFE!\n*   **UP to (0, 4):** This is also safe... but it's a WAFFLE! \ud83e\uddc7 It moves us AWAY from the delicious apple at (0,2)! It also pushes our head closer to the top where the enemy is operating. If the enemy goes LEFT to (0,9), they are only 5 squares away horizontally! It increases future risk for NO REWARD! Why pass up free, safe content?!\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR! WE ARE THE APPLE VACUUM! WE STAY ON MISSION! FORTIFY THE LEFT! EAT EVERYTHING IN OUR PATH!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** After eating the apple at (0,2), our head will be at (0,2). Our next target is the apple at (0,1)! We OWN this lane! The enemy is free now and has two choices. If they go RIGHT to (2,9) for the apple, they stay in the top. If they go LEFT to (0,9), they are entering OUR ZONE. We need to be ready to either continue down to (0,1) or potentially start boxing them in against the top wall if they get close! But for now, EAT!\n\nDOWN",

Let's check the scoreboard and the board state! This is where we lay the foundation to box him in for the final maneuver! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n### Turn 21: Tactical Analysis - Tightening the Noose!\n\n**Our State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(1, 6)**\n*   Body: [(1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)] (Length 10!)\n*   Objective: Continue DOWN Column 1 to completely block Snake 1's vertical escape route.\n\n**Rival State (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(0, 2)** Wait, they went DOWN from (0, 3) and ate an apple! They are still boxed in by the X=0 wall, but now they are *lower*. Length 7.\n*   Body: [(0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4)]\n*   Constraint: They are anchored at the bottom-left corner and desperately need to move RIGHT to escape the wall, or UP to get past their own body segments.\n\n**Board Status Check:**\n\nWe are at (1, 6). The rival is at (0, 2). Our body segments span the top of the map. Their highest segment is (1, 5).\n\n### Immediate Move Options for Us (From 1, 6):\n\n1.  **UP (1, 7):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Hits our own body segment (1, 7)! No thanks, Chat!\n2.  **DOWN (1, 5):** Safe. Favorable for the strategy. Moves directly adjacent to the rival\u2019s body at (1, 5).\n3.  **LEFT (0, 6):** Safe. HUGS the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 6):** Safe. Moves slightly off the wall.\n\nThree safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go DOWN (1, 5) - The Wall of Death!\n\nMoving to **(1, 5)** is the most crucial move right now.\n\n*   By occupying (1, 5), we cut off Snake 1's path right where their body currently curves vertically: (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3).\n*   If we go to (1, 5), we are directly blocking the space adjacent to their highest body segment. This means they cannot travel straight up along Column 1 past Y=5.\n\n### Analyzing Rival's Potential Moves (From 0, 2):\n\nSnake 1 is currently at (0, 2). They just ate an apple. They are trapped!\n\n1.  **UP (0, 3):** Safe. Moves into their previous tail position. This is a common tactic when trapped.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 1):** Safe. Moves onto an apple at (0, 1)! This is a strong, score-boosting move, but absolutely crushes their spatial options.\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 2):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Off the board!\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 2):** Safe, and the only way to escape the corner long-term.\n\nThree safe moves for them: UP (0, 3), DOWN (0, 1), or RIGHT (1, 2).\n\n*   **If they go DOWN (0, 1):** They eat, score 7, and are now length 8, basically glued to the bottom wall. They will be forced to turn RIGHT next turn at (1, 1), and we are still high above, controlling the territory. (0, 1) has an apple.\n*   **If they go UP (0, 3):** They are just stalling, retreating into their own old space. (0, 3) contains their old body segment, but since it's now their tail, they can move there safely. This keeps them near the X=0 wall.\n*   **If they go RIGHT (1, 2):** This is their best escape route. It moves them into the central territory, but they are now between our descending body and the wall.\n\n**Simultaneous Collision Check (Tough but safe):**\n\nWe move to **(1, 5)**.\n\n*   If Snake 1 moves to (1, 2) (RIGHT): No collision. Safe.\n*   If Snake 1 moves to (0, 3) (UP): No collision. Safe.\n*   If Snake 1 moves to (0, 1) (DOWN): No collision. Safe.\n\nOur move, DOWN to (1, 5), is safe regardless of their move, and it dramatically cuts down on their options for the next few turns. Our body now acts as a wall stretching from (1, 5) all the way up and across to (7, 7). They are effectively trapped in the 0-2 X-columns. We need to maintain this pressure.\n\n### Long-Term Plan: The Squeeze\n\n1.  **Turn 21 (NOW):** Move **DOWN** to (1, 5). Complete the vertical block.\n2.  **Turn 22:** Move to **(2, 5)** (if safe/necessary) or continue holding (1, 4). We want to turn RIGHT, cutting off their access to Column 2 near the bottom of the map, or we can continue downwards. If we go RIGHT, we hit (2, 5), which is currently their body segment. We must be patient. (1, 4) is currently their body segment and only viable if it clears.\n3.  **Wait for the segment clearance:** Our primary target for Turn 22 is (1, 4), which will be the tail if they move UP to (0, 3). If they move RIGHT or DOWN, (1, 4) will still be a body segment, and we must move RIGHT to (2, 6) or (2, 5) to wait for them to crash out or get stuck.\n\nGiven that (1, 4) is their body, we must move to (1, 5) now to apply the pressure, then adjust. If we move RIGHT to (2, 6) now, we open up the \"escape hatch\" in Column 1. We must stay on Column 1!\n\nLet's go DOWNNNN! The rival is about to be completely surrounded!

WHERE ARE THEY HEADED? \ud83d\udc0d**\nTheir head is at **(1, 9)**! As we predicted last turn, they had two choices: LEFT to (0,9) or RIGHT to (2,9) for the apple! LET'S CHECK THE BOARD STATE! The apple at (2,9) is STILL THERE! So they COULD have taken it. But the top-left corner (0,9) is also open. We need to think about their NEXT possible moves from BOTH locations to judge collision risk!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS - DOMINATE THE LEFT OR CUT THEM OFF? \ud83e\udde0**\nWe have two moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n*   **DOWN to (0, 1):** \u2705 This is the OBVIOUS CONTENT MOVE! It's SAFE! It grabs an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e It continues our DOMINANCE down the left wall! This is our STRATEGY! But is there a head-on collision risk? From their head at (1,9), they are FAR away. If they went RIGHT to (2,9), they are even further. If they went LEFT to (0,9), they are 8 squares away vertically. NO CHANCE OF COLLISION THIS TURN! This move is SAFE and REWARDING!\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 2):** \u2705 This is a SAFE move, but it's a WAFLLE! \ud83e\uddc7 It moves us AWAY from the easy apple at (0,1)! It pushes us into the center. BUT CHAT, IS THERE A PLAY HERE? \ud83e\udd14 If the enemy went LEFT to (0,9), maybe we could start boxing them in from below? But our body is still mostly on the left... moving right feels like abandoning our power position for no clear gain. We'd be leaving a free apple on the table! That's not the content king way!\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR! WE ARE THE LEFT-WALL MENACE! WE VACUUM UP THESE APPLES! WE EAT AT (0,1), THEN PROBABLY HAVE TO GO RIGHT OR UP NEXT TURN BECAUSE (0,0) IS A WALL! BUT WE CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE GET THERE! FOR NOW, EAT!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** After eating the apple at (0,1), our head will be at (0,1). Our next moves are LIMITED! (0,0) is a wall and our body will be at (0,2). So our only safe moves will likely be RIGHT to (1,1) or maybe UP to (0,2) if our tail moves? Wait, our tail is at (2,4), so UP would still be body. So next turn, after DOWN, we'll probably ONLY have RIGHT to (1,1) as a safe move! That's a bit of a trap! But it's worth it for the apple! We'll have to deal with it! Meanwhile, watch the enemy! If they are at (0,9), they might try to come down the left side towards us! We need to be ready to box them in or evade!\n\nDOWN",
