Here's the game plan:\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n- My head at (4,9) - top row, just one below the ceiling\n- Enemy at (3,6) - central left area  \n- Board is wide open but apples are scattered\n- No bodies to worry about yet (clean slate!)\n\n**Strategic Moves to Box Him In:**\nWe need to force him into corners while keeping our own escape routes. The enemy is currently 3 rows below us and slightly left. If we move DOWN from (4,9) to (4,8), we:\n- Keep him in our vertical range\n- Avoid getting trapped against the top wall\n- Maintain multiple escape routes (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN)\n- Start controlling the center-right area\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Moving UP would hit y=10 (DEAD) - instant throw, nope!\n- Moving LEFT to (3,9) is safe but pushes us toward the left wall\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,9) is safe but we want to start closing the distance  \n- Moving DOWN to (4,8) gives us the most flexibility to chase him down\n\n**Long-term Vision (Self-Note for Next Turn):**\nWe're setting up a pincer movement. Once we're at (4,8), we can start maneuvering to cut off his access to the apples on the left side. He's currently positioned near apples at (3,6) area, but we can influence his movement by positioning ourselves to threaten his head-on collision if we grow bigger. First apple collection is priority - we need to start building our score advantage!\n\n**THE PLAY:** We're dropping DOWN to (4,8) to maintain board control and keep our options open. Let's see how he moves and then we strike! \ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

Apples everywhere but we're ignoring them for now? Nah, we gotta grow to dominate! But also gotta think about boxing him in early.\n\n**Immediate safety check:**\n- UP \u2192 (3,7) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,5) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,6) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,6) \u2013 empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now. No body segments yet.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** He's at (4,9). He could go DOWN to (4,8) toward center, LEFT to (3,9), RIGHT to (5,9), or UP off board (death). He'll probably avoid UP. If he goes DOWN, he's moving toward apples at (4,5) and (4,1). Hmm.\n\n**Long-term plan:** I want to get between him and the center, cut off his movement options. If I go RIGHT to (4,6), I'm directly below him if he goes DOWN to (4,8). That sets up a potential vertical wall if I grow. But going LEFT to (2,6) gives me more space on that side with apples at (2,3), (2,2), (0,5), etc.\n\nActually, thinking aggressive: if I go RIGHT to (4,6) and he goes DOWN to (4,8), next turn I could go UP to (4,7) and we're head-to-head vertically one apart\u2014dangerous if he goes DOWN again into me, but I'd have higher score if I eat an apple first? Not yet, scores are equal. Head-on collision now would kill us both\u2014bad.\n\nBetter to go LEFT to (2,6), claim left side apples, grow longer than him, then push him against top wall.\n\n**Future flexibility:** LEFT keeps more options open\u2014left side has fewer borders near me, more room to maneuver.\n\n**Final choice:** I'm taking LEFT to (2,6), grab those left-side apples next, outgrow him, then trap him against the top.\n\nLEFT",

No risk of hitting myself or enemy body.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** He's at (4,8). He can go UP to (4,9) \u2013 safe, DOWN to (4,7) \u2013 safe, LEFT to (3,8) \u2013 safe, RIGHT to (5,8) \u2013 safe. He might go toward apples at (4,5) or (9,1)? But more likely he'll move toward center or toward me? Hmm.\n\n**Aggressive plan:** I want to cut off his space and grow faster. Look at apples: closest to me are (2,3), (2,2), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7) on left side. If I go LEFT to (1,6), I'm closer to those left-side apples and can start collecting next turn. If I go RIGHT to (3,6), I'm moving toward enemy head\u2014dangerous if he moves toward me, could cause head-on collision while scores are equal (both die). Not good.\n\n**Future flexibility:** Going LEFT gives me more open space on the left side of board. Going UP or DOWN keeps me central but doesn't claim territory as clearly. Going RIGHT risks early confrontation with no length advantage.\n\n**Long-term strategy note to future self:** Claim the left side apples, grow longer than him. Once I'm longer, I can push him against the top wall or force a head-on collision where I survive. Avoid direct confrontation until I have at least 1 apple lead.\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT to (1,6) to start dominating the left side and outgrow him safely.\n\nLEFT",

(4,5) is close, (2,3) is tempting, but focus on enemy!\n- I have 0 apples, he has 0 apples - gotta get that first apple to build advantage\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nEnemy is at (2,6) - he's not immediately threatening my space. But he could move toward my apples or cut me off if I'm not careful. I need to position myself to either steal his apples or block his escape routes.\n\n**My Options:**\n- UP to (4,9) - valid, but back to where I was, wastes time\n- DOWN to (4,7) - gets me closer to apple at (4,5) and enemy's position\n- LEFT to (3,8) - moves toward left side, closer to multiple apples\n- RIGHT to (5,8) - moves right, away from enemy and apple cluster\n\n**Strategic Play:**\nI want to CHASE this enemy down! Moving DOWN to (4,7) gives me:\n1. Direct path toward apple at (4,5) \n2. Closer vertical alignment to enemy at (2,6)\n3. Maintains center-right control\n4. Keeps multiple escape routes open\n\n**The Plan for Next 2 Turns:**\nGet to that apple at (4,5) while positioning to threaten enemy's space. Once I get an apple, I'll have length advantage and can force head-on collision if he's dumb enough to challenge me.\n\n**THE PLAY:** I'm dropping DOWN to (4,7) to close distance and set up my first apple grab!

Here's the play-by-play:\n\n**Current State Check:**\n- MY HEAD: (4,7) \u2014 Just landed here, body is empty.\n- ENEMY HEAD: (1,6) \u2014 Still chilling left of me, no body yet.\n- BOTH have 0 apples \u2014 This is a clean slate, but I need that first apple for momentum!\n- APPLES ON BOARD: Tons of options, but I'm ignoring the snacks for now. Target is the opponent. \n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nEnemy at (1,6) is my priority. He's not moving toward me yet, but I need to cut off his space and force him into a corner. He could move RIGHT to (2,6), UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), or LEFT to (0,6) \u2014 all within reach of apples. I need to react to his likely move.\n\n**My Safe Moves Analysis (From (4,7)):**\n- UP to (4,8): Safe, but returns to previous spot. Wastes a turn and gives enemy room to maneuver. Not aggressive. \u274c\n- DOWN to (4,6): Safe! Closer to apple at (4,5) AND closer vertically to enemy at (1,6). Maintains pressure. \u2705\n- LEFT to (3,7): Safe! Moves toward enemy's left side, possibly cutting off his escape routes. Good positioning. \u2705\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Safe, but moves away from enemy and key apples. Reduces pressure. \u274c\n\n**The Plan:**\nI want to STALK this enemy and force him into a bad position. Moving DOWN to (4,6) is the best play because:\n1. Gets me within striking distance of apple (4,5) for that first point.\n2. Aligns my y-coordinate with enemy (both at y=6), making it easier to chase and threaten him.\n3. Keeps my options open for next turn: from (4,6) I can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN depending on his move.\n4. Avoids trapping myself \u2014 the board is open, and I'm not cornering myself.\n\n**The Long-Term Strategy (For Future Me):**  \nI'm going to force a head-on collision once I get an apple. I need that length advantage! If he moves to (2,6) or (1,5), I can chase. If he moves UP to (1,7), I can flank. I'll monitor his move next turn and adjust. My goal is to box him in the left side and make him crash into me or the wall. Let's gooo! \ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

Both still length 1, scores tied at 0 apples.**\n\n**Immediate safety check:**\n- UP \u2192 (1,7) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,5) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,6) \u2013 has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e But no body yet, so moving onto apple is safe and we grow to length 2 next turn.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,6) \u2013 empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now! No walls, no bodies.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** He's at (4,7). He can go UP to (4,8), DOWN to (4,6), LEFT to (3,7), RIGHT to (5,7). He might go for apple at (4,5) DOWN? Or maybe toward center? He's far from us right now.\n\n**Aggressive plan:** We want to grow ASAP to get a length advantage! The apple at (0,6) is RIGHT THERE if we go LEFT! That gives us +1 apple and length 2 next turn, while he's still length 1. That's HUGE! Once we're longer, we can start boxing him in.\n\n**Risk of head-on collision?** Not this turn\u2014he's 3 cells away horizontally, 1 vertically. Even if he moves LEFT twice, we won't meet this turn. Safe.\n\n**Future flexibility:** If we eat the apple, our tail stays at (1,6) next turn, so our body will be [(0,6), (1,6)] head-to-tail. That blocks our path back to (1,6) temporarily, but we'll have options UP/DOWN/LEFT from (0,6). Going LEFT into apple also claims the left side\u2014good territory control.\n\n**Alternatives:** UP/DOWN/RIGHT don't get us an apple immediately. We want to snowball fast!\n\n**Long-term strategy note to future self:** We'll be length 2 after this move. Enemy still length 1. Next turn, avoid moving back into our own new body at (1,6). Use our length to cut off his movement options. Start moving toward him to pressure him into a corner or force a losing head-on collision once we have the length lead. Dominate the left side apples first!\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT to (0,6) to EAT THAT APPLE AND GROW! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

Eliminated.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,6) \u2013 OUR OWN BODY! \u274c That's our tail from last turn. Moving into our own body kills us. Eliminated.\n\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** He's at (4,6). He can go UP to (4,7), DOWN to (4,5), LEFT to (3,6), RIGHT to (5,6). There's an apple at (4,5) DOWN from him! He'll probably go for it to grow. If he goes DOWN, he'll be at (4,5) next turn with length 2.\n\n**Aggressive plan:** We have a length lead! We want to maintain pressure. If he eats the apple, we're tied length 2 vs 2, but we still have the apple score lead. We need to either cut him off or go for another apple to extend our lead.\n\n**Option analysis:**\n- **UP to (0,7):** Empty. Keeps us safe. From there next turn we could go UP to (0,8), RIGHT to (1,7), or DOWN back to (0,6) (but that's our body now? Wait, our body is [(0,6), (1,6)]. If we move UP, our body becomes [(0,7), (0,6), (1,6)]? Actually, after moving, the head goes to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, tail disappears unless we ate an apple. We didn't eat an apple this turn, so our tail at (1,6) disappears, body becomes [(0,7), (0,6)]. So (0,6) becomes our neck, not free. So from (0,7) next turn, DOWN to (0,6) is our own body\u2014not safe. So UP gives us future options UP or RIGHT mostly.\n- **DOWN to (0,5):** APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We eat it, grow to length 3, score 2-0. Our body becomes [(0,5), (0,6), (1,6)] after growth. From (0,5) next turn, we could go UP (back to 0,6\u2014our neck, not safe), DOWN to (0,4), LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1,5). So only DOWN or RIGHT would be safe next turn. But we gain length advantage!\n\n**Head-on collision risk?** He's at (4,6). If he goes LEFT to (3,6), then LEFT again later... not an immediate threat. No direct collision possible this turn since we're at (0,6) and he's at (4,6), we move only one cell.\n\n**Territory control:** Eating the apple at (0,5) claims bottom-left corner. If he eats his apple, he'll be at (4,5). We'll be at (0,5) length 3. We can then move RIGHT across the bottom row, maybe trap him against the wall.\n\n**Future self note:** After eating apple, our body blocks (0,6) and (1,6). We'll be at (0,5) with only DOWN or RIGHT safe. DOWN to (0,4) is open, then we can work east. RIGHT to (1,5) is open, then we can go UP/DOWN/RIGHT. Prefer RIGHT to start moving toward enemy while keeping options.\n\n**VERDICT:** DOWN to eat the apple, grow to length 3, and press our advantage! A longer snake means we can start boxing him in sooner. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

I'm at (4,6) and I'm NOT letting him get away with that lead. Time to close the gap!\n\n**Current State Check:**\n- MY HEAD: (4,6) \u2014 Just moved here last turn, body is empty.\n- ENEMY HEAD: (0,6) \u2014 He's hugging the left wall with a body segment at (1,6). He's got 1 apple, I have 0. I need to catch up FAST.\n- APPLES EVERYWHERE \u2014 But I'm ignoring them. My target is the snake. I need to force a collision or trap him.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nEnemy is at (0,6). Where can he go?\n- RIGHT to (1,6) \u2014 **CRASH!** His own body is there. He can't go right. (Wait, no\u2014his body is at (1,6), but his head is at (0,6). If he moves RIGHT to (1,6), he's moving into his own body? Yes! That would kill him! Unless... he just ate an apple? But he has 1 apple and a body segment. He grows when he eats. So his body length is 1. His head at (0,6), body at (1,6). If he moves RIGHT to (1,6), he's moving into his own body segment. That's suicide. He won't do that.)\n- UP to (0,7) \u2014 Safe? Check board: (0,7) is empty (Apple at (0,7) is listed in apple drops, but not on board state? Wait, board state shows A at (0,7)? Yes, row 7 has A at (0,7). So (0,7) has an apple. But he can move there and eat it. Safe.\n- DOWN to (0,5) \u2014 Safe? Board shows A at (0,5) (row 5 has A at (0,5)). So he could go down to eat.\n- LEFT to (-1,6) \u2014 Off board! Dies.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5). He can't go RIGHT or LEFT. He's trapped on the left edge! This is perfect. He's forced to move up or down.\n\nI'm at (4,6). I want to move toward him. My safe moves from (4,6):\n- UP to (4,7): Safe? Board shows row 7 has A at (0,7) but (4,7) is empty. No snake there. Safe.\n- DOWN to (4,5): Safe? Row 5 has A at (4,5). Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT to (3,6): Safe? Row 6: we have \"0 T . . 1 . . . A\". So at y=6, x=3 is \".\" (empty). Safe.\n- RIGHT to (5,6): Safe? Row 6 at x=5 is \"1\" (that's me! Wait, my head is at (4,6). Right of that is (5,6). According to board, at y=6, the row is: 0 at x=0, T at x=1, . at x=2, . at x=3, 1 at x=4, . at x=5? Wait the board string: \"0 T . . 1 . . . A .\" Let's parse: x=0:0, x=1:T, x=2:., x=3:., x=4:1, x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:A, x=9:. So (5,6) is empty. Safe.\n\nAll moves are safe. Now, which move maximizes pressure?\n\nI want to chase the enemy. He's at y=6, I'm at y=6. If I move LEFT to (3,6), I get closer to him horizontally. That puts me at x=3, he's at x=0. I'm 3 cells away. Next turn, if he moves UP or DOWN, I can continue chasing.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I move vertically, which might not be optimal because he's on the same y-level. But if he moves UP to (0,7), and I move UP to (4,7), then my y becomes 7, his y becomes 7. I'm still far horizontally. If he moves DOWN to (0,5), and I move DOWN to (4,5), same thing.\n\nMoving RIGHT is away from him, so that's bad.\n\nSo LEFT seems best to close horizontal distance.\n\nBut wait: I need to consider apples? The rules say \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\" So I should ignore apples. But eating an apple gives me a point and length, which helps for head-on collisions. However, I can eat apples while chasing. Let's see: if I go LEFT to (3,6), no apple there. If I go DOWN to (4,5), there's an apple at (4,5)! That would give me my first point and grow my body. That could be crucial. But the enemy already has 1 apple. If I eat one now, I tie. Then I can still chase.\n\nBut the enemy is trapped on the left. He can only go UP or DOWN. If I go DOWN to (4,5) and eat the apple, my body will now have a segment at (4,6) after I move? Actually, when I move onto an apple, I grow: my head moves to (4,5), and my old position (4,6) becomes my body segment. So I'll have a body of length 1 at (4,6). That's fine.\n\nIf I eat the apple, I get +1 point, tie the score. That might be good because if we collide head-on, I won't lose instantly. But I need to force a collision.\n\nLet's think about next turn: If I go DOWN to (4,5) and eat apple, I'm at (4,5) with body at (4,6). Enemy is at (0,6) or (0,7) or (0,5) depending on his move.\n\nIf enemy goes UP to (0,7): He's at (0,7), I'm at (4,5). Distance is large.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (0,5): He's at (0,5), I'm at (4,5). Same y, x difference 4. I can chase horizontally next turn.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,6): I'm at (3,6), no apple. Enemy at (0,6) or (0,7) or (0,5). If he goes UP to (0,7), I'm at (3,6), distance: x diff 3, y diff 1. If he goes DOWN to (0,5), x diff 3, y diff 1.\n\nWhich gives me more options? From (3,6), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. From (4,5), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. Both are open.\n\nBut note: if I eat the apple, I gain length. That's good for survival and for head-on collisions. Also, the apple at (4,5) is right there. It's safe. Why not take it? The enemy isn't near it. He's on the left side.\n\nThe rule says \"Do not focus on where the apples are.\" But it also says \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\" And \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" So if I eat an apple, I increase my score, which helps for head-on collision.\n\nSo I think I should eat the apple at (4,5). That will tie the score 1-1. Then I can continue chasing.\n\nBut wait: if I eat the apple, my body will be at (4,6). That means if the enemy somehow moves into (4,6) on his turn, he would die (crash into my body). But he's at (0,6), far away. He can't reach (4,6) in one turn. So it's safe.\n\nAlso, if I move DOWN to (4,5), I need to check that it's safe: no other snake body there, not off board, not into my own body (I have no body yet). It's safe.\n\nNow, what about the enemy's potential move? He might go UP or DOWN. If he goes DOWN to (0,5), there's an apple at (0,5) according to board? Row 5 has \"A . . . A . . . . .\" so (0,5) is an apple. He would eat that and grow, getting his second apple. That would put him at 2 apples, me at 1. That's worse for me. If he goes UP to (0,7), there's an apple at (0,7) too? Row 7 has \"A . . . . . . . . .\" so (0,7) is an apple. He would eat that and get his second apple as well. So either way, he's going to eat an apple and get to 2 apples. That means if I eat my apple, I'm at 1, he's at 2. Then I'm still behind.\n\nBut wait: I can't prevent him from eating that apple; he's trapped on the left edge with apples at (0,5) and (0,7). He has to move to one of them. So he will get another apple this turn. That means he'll be at 2 apples, I'll be at 1 if I eat mine. So I'll be behind.\n\nBut maybe I should not eat my apple and instead move LEFT to get closer to him, so next turn I can threaten him more directly. If I move LEFT to (3,6), and he eats an apple and moves to (0,5) or (0,7), then next turn I can chase. But he'll have 2 apples, I have 0. That's even worse.\n\nActually, I need to eat apples to catch up. The difference is: if I eat one, I'm at 1, he's at 2. If I don't eat, I'm at 0, he's at 2. So I should eat to stay closer.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to cut him off. Let's think about future turns.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,5) and eat apple, my body at (4,6). Enemy at (0,5) or (0,7).\n\nCase 1: Enemy goes DOWN to (0,5). Then:\n- My head: (4,5), body: (4,6)\n- Enemy head: (0,5), body: (0,6) [since he moved from (0,6) to (0,5), his old position (0,6) becomes his body? Wait, his body was at (1,6). When he moves, his head moves, and his body follows: the tail moves. Actually, the snake list is head-to-tail. Currently, snake #0: head (0,6), body [(1,6)]. So if he moves DOWN to (0,5), his new head is (0,5), his body becomes [old head (0,6)]? Actually, the body is the previous positions. Typically, when a snake moves, the head moves forward, and the body follows: the new body is the old head plus the old body except the tail moves. But in this game, the body is given as a list. For snake #0, body is [(1,6)]. That means the segment after head is at (1,6). When he moves, if he doesn't eat, his tail moves away, so the body becomes [old head]? Actually, the representation: \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\" So for snake #0: head (0,6), body [(1,6)] means the body segment is at (1,6), which is directly connected to the head. So the snake has length 2: head at (0,6), body at (1,6). When he moves, if he doesn't eat an apple, his tail will move forward, so the new body will be [old head (0,6)]? Actually, no: the body list is the segments after the head. So current body list: [(1,6)]. After moving, if he doesn't eat, the new head is at new position, and the new body becomes [old head] + old body without the last element? But the last element is the tail. Since he has only one body segment, that body segment is the tail. When he moves, the tail moves to the old head position? Actually, the snake slides: the head moves forward, each body segment takes the previous position of the segment in front. So for a length-2 snake: head at H, body at B. When moving, new head at H', new body at H (the old head). So yes, if he moves DOWN to (0,5), his new body will be [(0,6)]. So his body segment will be at (0,6). That's important.\n\nSimilarly for me: if I move DOWN to (4,5) and don't eat? But I am eating an apple, so I grow. My new head at (4,5), and my old position (4,6) becomes a body segment. So my body becomes [(4,6)].\n\nNow, if enemy moves to (0,5), I'm at (4,5). We are on the same row, y=5, x diff 4. Not an immediate collision.\n\nIf enemy moves to (0,7), then his body becomes [(0,6)].\n\nSo in either case, after this turn, I'll have a body at (4,6), and he'll have a body at either (0,6) or (0,6) (if he moves, his old head becomes body at (0,6)). Actually, if he moves to (0,5), his body is at (0,6). If he moves to (0,7), his body is at (0,6) as well. So his body will be at (0,6) in both cases! That's interesting. So his body will be fixed at (0,6) after this move, because his head was at (0,6) and he moves away, leaving a body segment there.\n\nThat means (0,6) becomes a dangerous spot for me next turn? Actually, it's his body, so if I move into (0,6), I die. But I'm not planning to go that far yet.\n\nNow, back to my move: I think eating the apple at (4,5) is good because it gives me a point and length. I need to catch up. Also, note that there is an apple at (4,5) right in front of me. It's safe and available.\n\nWhat about other moves? UP to (4,7): no apple there, and I don't get closer to enemy. LEFT to (3,6): no apple, but closer to enemy horizontally. RIGHT to (5,6): no apple, moves away.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN, DOWN gives me an apple, LEFT doesn't. But LEFT gets me closer to enemy. However, if I go LEFT, I might be able to cut him off sooner. But he's on the left edge, I'm at x=4. To cut him off, I need to get to x<=1 maybe. If I go LEFT to (3,6), next turn I could go LEFT again to (2,6), then (1,6) but that's his body? Actually, his body will be at (0,6) after he moves. So (1,6) might be empty? Let's see: currently, his body is at (1,6). But after he moves, his body will be at (0,6) (old head). What happens to the old body segment at (1,6)? It becomes the tail? Actually, for a length-2 snake: head at H, body at B. When moving, new head at H', new body at H. So the old body B is discarded (the tail moves away). So the segment at (1,6) will disappear. So after he moves, (1,6) becomes empty. That's important.\n\nSo if I go LEFT to (3,6) now, and he moves to (0,5) or (0,7), then (1,6) is empty. Next turn, I could move LEFT to (2,6), then to (1,6), then to (0,6) but that's his body. Actually, I don't want to crash into his body. I want to crash into his head. So I need to anticipate his head movement.\n\nBut if I eat the apple now, I grow, and I'm at (4,5). Then next turn, I can move LEFT to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5), etc. That might also work.\n\nBut note: there's an apple at (4,5) that I can eat now. If I don't eat it, someone else might? But there's only two snakes. The enemy is far away, so he won't eat it soon. So it's safe to leave it for later? But the rules say to focus on the enemy, not apples. So maybe I should ignore the apple and just chase.\n\nHowever, the rationale from last turn said: \"I want to STALK this enemy and force him into a bad position. Moving DOWN to (4,6) is the best play because: 1. Gets me within striking distance of apple (4,5) for that first point.\" So I planned to eat that apple eventually. Now I'm at (4,6) and the apple is at (4,5). It's right there. It would be silly not to eat it.\n\nAlso, if I eat it, I tie the apple count? No, he has 1, I'll have 1. Actually, he's going to eat an apple this turn too, so he'll have 2. So I'll be behind. But I need to start collecting.\n\nMaybe I should think about trapping him. He's on the left edge with apples at (0,5) and (0,7). If I can get to (1,5) or (1,7), I might cut off his escape. But I'm at x=4. To get to x=1, I need two moves: LEFT twice. If I go LEFT now to (3,6), next turn I can go LEFT to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6). But after he moves, (1,6) might be empty, so I could occupy it. But then I'd be at (1,6), and he's at (0,5) or (0,7). From there, I could threaten him. However, if I'm at (1,6), and he's at (0,5), then if he moves RIGHT to (1,5), that's not into me. If he moves UP to (0,6), that's his own body? Actually, his body will be at (0,6) after he moves from (0,6) to (0,5). So if he moves UP to (0,6), he'd be moving into his own body? That would kill him. So he can't move UP if his body is at (0,6). So from (0,5), he can go DOWN to (0,4) (if safe), LEFT off-board (die), RIGHT to (1,5) (safe if empty), UP to (0,6) (his own body, die). So he might be forced to go RIGHT or DOWN. That could lead him toward me.\n\nBut if I'm at (1,6), and he goes RIGHT to (1,5), that's adjacent but not head-on. Next turn I could move DOWN to (1,5) and collide? But he'd move away.\n\nActually, I need to force a head-on collision. That means I need to predict where he'll be and move into that cell simultaneously.\n\nGiven his constraints, he might be predictable.\n\nBut first, I need to decide: eat apple or not?\n\nLet's consider the score. If I eat an apple now, I get +1. He will get +1 too (since he has to move to an apple). So after turn 3, scores: me 1, him 2. If I don't eat, I'm 0, him 2. So I'm worse off. So I should eat to at least have 1.\n\nAlso, growing gives me length, which might help in survival and in head-on collisions.\n\nSo I think eating is better.\n\nBut wait: what if I go LEFT to (3,6), and then next turn I can eat an apple? There's an apple at (3,7) maybe? Not sure. Board shows at (3,7) is empty? Row 7: \"A . . . . . . . . .\" so only (0,7) has apple. So no apple at (3,7). There's an apple at (2,3) etc. So not immediate.\n\nThus, eating the available apple at (4,5) seems wise.\n\nNow, check safety: Moving DOWN to (4,5). Is there any snake body there? No. Is it off board? No. Is it into my own body? I have no body, so fine. Also, simultaneous move: enemy moves to (0,5) or (0,7). He won't be at (4,5). So safe.\n\nAlso, after I move, my body will be at (4,6). That's not in the way.\n\nWhat about enemy moving into my body? He's at (0,6), can't reach (4,6) in one move. Safe.\n\nWhat about head-on collision? If he moves to (4,5)? Impossible, he's too far.\n\nSo DOWN is safe.\n\nNow, what about the apple at (4,5)? It's there. I'll eat it.\n\nSo I'll go DOWN.\n\nBut wait, there's also an apple at (5,4)? Not relevant.\n\nI think DOWN is the best move.\n\nLet's see if there's any reason to go LEFT. If I go LEFT, I don't get an apple, but I get closer to enemy. However, he's going to eat an apple and get to 2 points. I'll be at 0. Then he has a bigger lead. I need to start scoring.\n\nThe objective is to win. Winning can happen by having more apples at the end, or by killing all opponents. To kill him, I need to force him to crash into me or the wall. If I can trap him on the left edge, he might eventually crash. But that takes time. In the meantime, I should collect apples.\n\nAlso, the rule says: \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\" So I should grow.\n\nTherefore, I'll go DOWN to eat the apple at (4,5).\n\nNow, for the rationale: I'll explain this.\n\nAlso, I need to provide a long-term plan for future self.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 3 and we're making power moves! The enemy is trapped on the left edge with apples at (0,5) and (0,7), so he's about to get his second point. I need to catch up FAST!\n\n**Current State Check:**\n- MY HEAD: (4,6) \u2014 Ready to strike.\n- ENEMY HEAD: (0,6) \u2014 Stuck between a rock and a hard place (the wall and his own body). He can only go UP or DOWN, and both have apples! He's gonna eat again.\n- SCORES: Enemy has 1, I have 0. Time to level up!\n- MY MOVE OPTIONS: All four directions are safe, but one stands out...\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nEnemy is forced to move to (0,5) or (0,7) and will grow to 2 apples. I can't stop that. But I CAN start closing the gap by grabbing the apple right in front of me at (4,5). If I don't take it, I stay at 0 while he gets 2. That's a deficit I don't want.\n\n**The Play:**\nDOWN to (4,5) and CHOMP that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\nWhy?\n- It's SAFE: No snakes, no walls, no self-collision.\n- It's SMART: I get my first point, tieing us closer (he'll be at 2, I'll be at 1). Growth means more board presence and better odds in a head-on collision.\n- It's AGGRESSIVE: I'm not just chasing; I'm building power while staying positioned to chase. From (4,5), I have open space to maneuver left toward him next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:**\nNext turn, I'll be at (4,5) with a body segment at (4,6). Enemy will be at (0,5) or (0,7) with body at (0,6). I need to start cutting off his space. My plan: move LEFT toward him, aiming to occupy (3,5) or (3,7) depending on his move, then continue closing the gap. I want to force him into the corner where he has to choose between crashing into me or the wall. Once I have more apples, I'll go for the head-on collision. Let's hunt! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**DOWN",

Now we're both at 1 apple? Wait, no\u2014the scoreboard says he has 2 and I have 1. He must have eaten an apple last turn. So he's at 2, I'm at 1. That means I'm still one behind, but I just ate this turn, so I'm now at 2 apples. That ties me up with him! \ud83c\udf89\n\n**Current State Check:**\n- MY HEAD: (4,5) \u2014 Just ate the apple, body is at (4,6). I'm growing strong!\n- ENEMY HEAD: He moved from (0,6) to either (0,5) or (0,7) and got his second point. Now his head is at (0,5) or (0,7) with body at (0,6). I need to know which, but I can't see. I'll assume he went DOWN to (0,5) since that's closer to me? Actually, I need to plan for both.\n- SCORES: I'm now at 2 apples (tied), he's at 2 apples. This is crucial\u2014head-on collision is even now!\n- MY MOVE OPTIONS: From (4,5), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. I need to choose wisely.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nI need to start closing the gap. From (4,5), moving LEFT to (3,5) gets me closer to the enemy's side. If he's at (0,5), then (3,5) is only 3 cells away horizontally. If he's at (0,7), then I'm on the same y-level as his potential path. But I also want to keep options open.\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n- UP to (4,6): That's into my own body! My body is at (4,6). If I move up, I'd be moving into my own segment. That's suicide. So UP is OFF THE TABLE. \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN to (4,4): Safe? Check board: Row 4 has \". . . . . A . . . .\" so (4,4) is empty. No snakes there. That's safe. But it moves me away from the enemy (who is on y=5 or y=7). Not ideal for chasing.\n- LEFT to (3,5): Safe? Row 5: \"0 . . . 1 . . . . .\" Wait, the board shows at y=5: 0 at x=0, . at x=1, . at x=2, . at x=3, 1 at x=4. So (3,5) is empty. Safe. This moves me closer to the enemy.\n- RIGHT to (5,5): Safe? Row 5 at x=5 is \".\" (empty). Safe. But this moves me away from the enemy, so not good.\n\nSo LEFT and DOWN are safe, RIGHT is safe but bad direction, UP is deadly. LEFT seems best to pursue. But also, if I go LEFT, I'm moving to (3,5), which is next to an apple? Row 5 doesn't have an apple at (3,5). Row 4 has an apple at (4,5)? Actually, (4,5) is where I just was, and I ate it. So no apple at (3,5). That's fine; I'm focusing on the enemy.\n\nWhat about the enemy's possible moves? If he's at (0,5), he can go UP to (0,6) but that's his own body? His body is at (0,6)? Wait, after he moves, his body shifts. If he moved to (0,5) this turn, his body is at (0,6) (old head). So if he tries to go UP to (0,6), he'd be moving into his own body\u2014dead. So he can't go UP. He can go DOWN to (0,4) (safe?), LEFT off board dead, RIGHT to (1,5) (safe? probably). So he has options but is constrained. If he's at (0,7), similar constraints.\n\nMy plan: Move LEFT to (3,5) to cut off his horizontal space and start boxing him in. Next turn, I can continue left or move vertically to corner him.\n\nLong-term: I need to force a head-on collision or trap him. Since we're tied, head-on is a draw, but if I can force him into a wall while I'm growing, I win. I'll keep chasing him along the bottom left, using my body as a barrier.

Safe.\n\nSo only **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are safe.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** He's at (4,5). He can go UP to (4,6) (his own tail? Wait his body is [(4,6)] so UP is his tail, moving into own tail is death! So UP is unsafe for him unless he grows? He didn't eat an apple last turn? He was at (4,6) last turn, moved to (4,5) and ate the apple at (4,5)? Yes! The apple at (4,5) was there last turn. So he moved DOWN from (4,6) to (4,5) and ate it. So his body is now [(4,5), (4,6)]? Wait, his body listed is [(4,6)] only? The opponent info says: Head: (4,5), Body: [(4,6)], Apples: 1. That means his head is at (4,5), his only body segment is at (4,6) (his previous head). So his tail is at (4,6). So from (4,5):\n- UP to (4,6) \u2013 his own tail! That's moving backwards into his body? Actually, moving into your own tail is safe IF you ate an apple and the tail hasn't moved yet? Wait, rules: moving into your own body kills you. But if you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail stays put. So if he moves UP into (4,6), that's his tail cell. Since he just ate an apple, his tail will NOT move this turn, so moving into (4,6) would be moving into his own body segment and he'd die. So UP is unsafe for him.\n- DOWN to (4,4) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- LEFT to (3,5) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT to (5,5) \u2013 empty, safe.\n\nSo he has DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT as safe options.\n\n**Head-on collision risk?** If we go RIGHT to (1,5) and he goes LEFT to (3,5), no collision. If he goes LEFT twice next turns maybe later. No immediate head-on.\n\n**Strategic thinking:** We have length 3 vs his length 2. We want to use our length to cut off his space. Look at the board: bottom-left corner is our territory. If we go DOWN to (0,4), we stay along the left wall, maybe work our way east along the bottom. If we go RIGHT to (1,5), we move toward the center, more options.\n\n**Future move options:**\n- If we go **DOWN to (0,4)**: Next turn from (0,4), safe moves? UP to (0,5) is our neck (body), unsafe. DOWN to (0,3) empty. LEFT off board. RIGHT to (1,4) empty. So only DOWN or RIGHT next turn. That's limiting.\n- If we go **RIGHT to (1,5)**: Next turn from (1,5), safe moves? UP to (1,6) \u2013 our body? Our body is [(0,5), (0,6), (1,6)]? Wait, after moving RIGHT, our body shifts: head to (1,5), then segments: old head (0,5) becomes neck, then (0,6), then tail (1,6) disappears because we didn't eat an apple. So body becomes [(1,5), (0,5), (0,6)]. So (1,6) is free! Actually (1,6) is empty now. So from (1,5): UP to (1,6) empty, safe. DOWN to (1,4) empty, safe. LEFT to (0,5) our neck, unsafe. RIGHT to (2,5) empty, safe. So three safe moves! Much better flexibility.\n\n**Aggressive plan:** Go RIGHT to get more options and move toward the enemy. We can start boxing him in from the west. With our length lead, we can try to trap him against the top wall or right wall later.\n\n**Apple consideration:** There's an apple at (0,2) far down, but going DOWN now would limit us. Better to stay mobile and maybe grab apples later when safe.\n\n**VERDICT:** RIGHT to (1,5) gives us maximum future options and starts our advance toward the enemy! We keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

I moved left last turn as planned.\n- MY BODY: [(4, 5)] - That's where my tail was. Now I'm at (3,5) with body at (4,5).\n- ENEMY: Snake #0 at head (1,5), body [(0,5), (0,6)] - He's still chilling at x=1, y=5.\n- SCORE: Me: 1 apple (Wait, scoreboard says 1, but I thought I ate? Let me check... Actually, the apple I was on at (4,5) was already eaten by me on turn 4. So I'm at 1 apple total. He's at 2 apples. I'm BEHIND! \ud83d\ude24\n- BOARD: 10x10 grid with many apples.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT CHECK:**\nLet's see what moves could kill me from (3,5):\n\n1. **UP to (3,6)**: Check board - Row 6 has \"T . . A . . . . A .\". (3,6) is empty (dot). Safe! \n2. **DOWN to (3,4)**: Row 4: \". . . . . A . . . .\" (3,4) is empty. Safe!\n3. **LEFT to (2,5)**: Row 5: \"0 . . . 1 . . . . .\" Actually wait, row 5 shows: position 0 is 0 (enemy head), position 1 is ., position 2 is ., position 3 is ., position 4 is 1 (my head), so (2,5) is empty. Safe!\n4. **RIGHT to (4,5)**: This is MY OWN BODY! I'm at (3,5) and my body is at (4,5). Moving right would hit my own body. **DEAD!** \ud83d\udeab\n\n**STRATEGY CONSIDERATION:**\nI need to catch up! He has 2 apples, I have 1. I should go for apples while closing the distance to him. But also, I need to think about trapping him.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- There's an apple at (2,3) - that's close! From (3,5), if I go DOWN to (3,4), then I'm one step away from (2,3) next turn.\n- There's an apple at (2,2) - also close.\n- There's an apple at (2,9) - too far.\n- Enemy is at (1,5) - I could potentially approach him.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (3,6)**: Safe, but moves me away from enemy and most apples. Not ideal.\n- **DOWN to (3,4)**: Safe, moves me toward apples at (2,3) and (2,2), and keeps me on same y-level as enemy (y=5). Good option!\n- **LEFT to (2,5)**: Safe, moves me closer to enemy (distance now 1 cell horizontally), but might be risky if he moves right into me. Also, no immediate apple here.\n- **RIGHT to (4,5)**: **DEAD** - hits my own body.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI want to eat apples and close the gap. Going DOWN to (3,4) puts me in a great position to grab the apple at (2,3) or (2,2) next turn. It also keeps me on the board and maintains options. \n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,5), I'm right next to the enemy at (1,5). If he moves RIGHT, we could have a head-on collision. But since he has more apples (2 vs 1), a head-on would kill us both and he'd win by score. I don't want that yet. I need to get more apples first!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. Grab the nearby apples at (2,3) or (2,2) to tie or take the lead.\n2. Use my body to create barriers and cut off the enemy's escape routes.\n3. Once I have equal or more apples, THEN force head-on collisions to eliminate him.\n4. Avoid getting trapped in the corner - keep movement options open.\n\n**MOVE SELECTION:**\nDOWN to (3,4) gives me the best balance of safety, apple proximity, and strategic positioning. Let's do this!\n\nDOWN",

LET'S GOOO!\n\n**Immediate safety check from (1,5):**\nOur body: [(0,5), (0,6)] (head at (1,5), neck at (0,5), then (0,6) as tail).\n- UP \u2192 (1,6) \u2013 Empty! \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,4) \u2013 Empty! \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,5) \u2013 That's our OWN NECK! \u274c DEATH. Eliminated.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,5) \u2013 Empty! \u2705 Safe.\n\nSo **UP, DOWN, RIGHT** are safe. NICE! Three options!\n\n**Enemy prediction:** He's at (3,5), body at [(4,5)]. From (3,5):\n- UP to (3,6) \u2013 Empty, safe.\n- DOWN to (3,4) \u2013 Empty, safe.\n- LEFT to (2,5) \u2013 Empty, safe.\n- RIGHT to (4,5) \u2013 His own body segment! \u274c DEATH. So RIGHT is unsafe for him.\n\nHe has **UP, DOWN, LEFT** as safe moves.\n\n**Head-on collision risk THIS TURN:** If we go RIGHT to (2,5) and he goes LEFT to (2,5), we collide head-on! That's a DOUBLE KO! We have length 3 vs his length 2, so if we collide, we both die and the game ends? Wait, if all snakes die, the snake with more apples wins! We have 2 apples vs his 1 apple, so WE WIN THE GAME! \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udf89 That's actually a WIN for us! So going RIGHT could force a winning head-on if he chooses LEFT! But what if he doesn't go LEFT? Then we just move to (2,5) safely.\n\n**Other considerations:**\n- If we go UP to (1,6): moves us away from enemy, maybe toward top-left. Keeps options open.\n- If we go DOWN to (1,4): moves us toward bottom-left apples (like (0,2)), but might corner us.\n- If we go RIGHT to (2,5): aggressive, central, and sets up potential winning head-on if he goes left.\n\n**Future flexibility from each:**\n- UP to (1,6): From there, safe moves? UP (1,7) empty, DOWN (1,5) neck, LEFT (0,6) our tail? Wait, our tail after moving UP: body becomes [(1,6), (1,5), (0,5)]? Actually, tail was (0,6), but after moving, tail shifts: head to (1,6), neck (1,5), then (0,5) becomes tail? Let's simulate: current body: head (1,5), segments (0,5), (0,6). Move UP: new head (1,6). Body shifts: new segment 1 = old head (1,5), new segment 2 = old segment 1 (0,5). Old tail (0,6) is removed because no apple eaten. So new body: [(1,6), (1,5), (0,5)]. So from (1,6): UP (1,7) empty, DOWN (1,5) neck (unsafe), LEFT (0,6) empty? Wait (0,6) is now empty (old tail removed), so LEFT is safe! RIGHT (2,6) empty. So three safe moves again! Good.\n- DOWN to (1,4): New body: [(1,4), (1,5), (0,5)]. From (1,4): UP (1,5) neck unsafe, DOWN (1,3) empty, LEFT (0,4) empty, RIGHT (2,4) empty. So three safe moves too! Good.\n- RIGHT to (2,5): New body: [(2,5), (1,5), (0,5)]. From (2,5): UP (2,6) empty, DOWN (2,4) empty, LEFT (1,5) neck unsafe, RIGHT (3,5) enemy head? That's where enemy currently is, but he'll move this turn. So next turn (3,5) could be empty or his body. Risky but possibly safe. So two safe moves guaranteed (UP, DOWN), maybe RIGHT if he vacates.\n\n**Strategic plan:** We have a length lead. Force the issue! If we go RIGHT, we either move safely or win by head-on collision because we have more apples! That's a WIN-WIN! He might avoid LEFT if he sees the risk, but he might also go LEFT hoping we don't go RIGHT? But we're streaming LIVE, he can't see our move! Simultaneous moves, baby! It's a gamble, but a favorable one for us! If he goes LEFT and we go RIGHT, we WIN THE GAME! If he goes UP or DOWN, we just occupy (2,5) and are closer to boxing him.\n\n**Apple check:** Closest apples: (0,2) far, (1,2) far, (2,2) near but down. Not urgent.\n\n**VERDICT:** GO RIGHT! Force the potential winning head-on! We have the apple advantage, so a double KO means WE WIN! LET'S PUSH THE ENVELOPE! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Check: Row 5 shows \" . T T . . . . . . .\" - (4,5) is the dot after the two T's. So it's EMPTY! Safe!\n2. **DOWN to (4,3)**: Row 3 shows \" . . A . . . . . . .\" - (4,3) is empty.

I'm already partially trapped by my own body.\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (2,4) can:\n- **UP (2,5)**: His own body! Can't go there.\n- **DOWN (2,3)**: There's an apple at (2,3)!

This gives me:\n1. **Score advantage: 3-2** \ud83c\udfc6\n2. **Safe position** with multiple future options\n3. **Growth** which is crucial for board domination\n4. **Pressure** on the enemy who's now behind\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. **Eat apple at (5,4) now** \u2192 Lead 3-2\n2. From (5,4), I'm in the center-right of the board with good mobility\n3. Track enemy - if he goes for (2,3) apple, I'll pursue from above\n4.

Puts us near left wall, but we can pivot. However, it moves us AWAY from him.\n- **RIGHT to (3,2):** Moves TOWARD the center! No apple, but positions us to cut off his southward escape next turn. Keeps us flexible.\n- **DOWN to (2,1):** Moves toward bottom wall, away from action. Less aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to TRAP HIM! He's shorter, we can afford to be bold. If we go RIGHT to (3,2), next turn we can go UP to (3,3) or RIGHT to (4,2) to start cutting off the board. He might go for the apple at (7,1) or (9,4). We want to get BETWEEN him and the open space. Growing is good, but DOMINATION is better! However, eating that apple at (1,2) is FREE CONTENT and makes us even longer, increasing our boxing power. TOUGH CHOICE!\n\n**VERDICT:** EAT THE APPLE! GROW TO 6! Then next turn from (1,2) we can go UP to (1,3) or RIGHT to (2,2) (tail might move). The extra length is a HUGE advantage for trapping.

From (0,2), our only safe moves next turn would be UP to (0,3) or DOWN to (0,1) \u2014 that's limiting! Going UP to (1,3) opens more options: next turn we can go UP to (1,4), LEFT to (0,3), or RIGHT to (2,3) (but careful, our body at (2,3) will move as tail moves? Actually tail at (1,5) will move to (??) since we didn't eat this turn, tail moves forward. So (2,3) might become safe next turn). We want to CUT OFF HIS SOUTHERN ESCAPE toward apples at (7,1), (9,0), etc. By moving UP we position to block.\n\n**VERDICT:** AGGRESSION OVER CONTENT!

Safe! \u2705\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n- **LEFT** = death (into my own body)\n- **UP, DOWN, or RIGHT** = all safe!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at the board from (8,4):\n- **UP to (8,5)**: Leads toward apple at (8,6) which is two steps away. From (8,5) I could go to (8,6) next turn.\n- **DOWN to (8,3)**: Leads toward apple at (7,1) but that's further.

Need to close that 2-apple gap fast!\n2. **POSITIONING** - From (9,4), I'll be on the right edge but still have options: UP to (9,5), DOWN to (9,3), or LEFT back to (8,4) after my tail moves (but that might hit my own tail depending on timing).\n3. **DOMINATION** - Eating apples is how I dominate.

Safe move!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. **Eat NOW** - Grab that apple at (9,4) to reach 4 apples\n2. **Chase the lead** - Enemy has 5, I'll have 4 - still 1 behind but much closer\n3. **From (9,4)**, next turn consider UP to (9,5) toward apple at (8,6) or (9, something)\n4. **Force engagement** - Once I'm at 5 apples (tied), start positioning to box enemy in\n\n**LET'S GET THAT APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]? Wait, the board shows our tail at (2,5)? Actually the board shows 'T' at (2,5) and (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2). That's 5 body segments plus head = length 6. YES! Tail is at (2,5). We did NOT eat last turn (we moved UP to (1,3) with no apple), so our tail will move forward next turn, freeing up (2,5).\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION:** Head at (8,4), length 3. He's WEAK! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (1,3):**\n- UP \u2192 (1,4) \u2013 Empty! \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,2) \u2013 That's our OWN BODY! \u274c DEATH.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,3) \u2013 Empty! \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,3) \u2013 That's our OWN BODY! \u274c DEATH.\n\nSo only UP and LEFT are safe.

No overlap.\n- If we go LEFT to (0,3): He could go... no overlap.\n\nNO immediate head-on risk! Good.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:** We have a LENGTH LEAD! We want to BOX HIM IN! He's on the right edge (8,4). If he goes RIGHT to (9,4), he eats an apple and grows to length 4. We need to CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES! He might try to go DOWN toward the cluster of apples at bottom right (9,0), (9,1), (8,0), (7,1). We should move to CONTROL THE CENTER and BLOCK HIS PATH SOUTH!\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT to (0,3):** Moves us to the left wall. No apple. Limits our future options \u2014 from (0,3), next turn only UP/DOWN/RIGHT? Actually LEFT is off-board. That's risky, could get trapped. Not aggressive toward enemy.\n- **UP to (1,4):** Advances toward the center! No apple, but opens more options: next turn from (1,4) we can go UP to (1,5) (empty), LEFT to (0,4) (empty), RIGHT to (2,4) (but our body at (2,4) will MOVE as tail advances? Actually tail at (2,5) moves to (??) \u2014 wait, our body segments shift: head moves to (1,4), then (1,3) becomes segment 2, (1,2) becomes segment 3, (2,2) becomes segment 4, (2,3) becomes segment 5, (2,4) becomes the NEW TAIL. So (2,4) will be occupied next turn! So RIGHT to (2,4) would be unsafe next turn. But we have other options. UP positions us to go further UP/LEFT to cut off his potential westward movement.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to SWEEP EAST and SOUTH, forcing him toward the top-right corner! From (1,4), next turn consider going UP to (1,5) or LEFT to (0,4) to start wrapping around. We must anticipate his likely move: he might go RIGHT to (9,4) to eat the apple, then next turn he could go DOWN to (9,3) or UP to (9,5). We want to be in a position to block his descent toward the bottom apple cluster. Moving UP now is a step in that direction!\n\n**VERDICT:** AGGRESSION! We go UP to (1,4) to maintain central pressure and keep options open! We don't greed for apples yet \u2014 we TRAP THE ENEMY! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

Time to push the advantage! \ud83d\ude08\n- **GAME TIMER:** 13/150 turns - plenty of time to hunt!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT CHECK (From position (9,5)):**\n1. **UP to (9,6)**: Row 6 shows \" . . . A . . . . A .\" - (9,6) is empty. Safe! \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (9,4)**: **MY OWN BODY!** (9,4) is my second segment - DEAD! \ud83d\udeab\n3. **LEFT to (8,5)**: Row 5 shows \" . 0 . . . . A . . 1\" - (8,5) is empty (the '1' is my head at (9,5)). Safe! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT** - Off the board! DEAD! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n- **UP** = safe (empty, leads toward apple at (8,6))\n- **LEFT** = safe (empty, repositions toward center)\n- **DOWN** = death (into own body)\n- **RIGHT** = death (off board)\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nFrom (9,5) on the right edge, I have two safe options:\n- **UP to (9,6)**: Moves toward the apple at (8,6) and (7,8). Gets me closer to the top-right area where there are more apples. Also keeps me away from the enemy who's in the bottom-left.\n- **LEFT to (8,5)**: Moves into the board center. From (8,5), I can then go UP to (8,6) (another apple!), LEFT to (7,5), or DOWN to (8,4). This opens up more immediate options.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**GO LEFT to (8,5)!** \ud83d\udca5\n\n**REASONING:**\n1. **POSITIONING FOR DOMINATION** - From (8,5), I'm no longer trapped on the right edge. I can now move in ANY direction (except BACK to (9,5)) next turn, giving me maximum flexibility.\n2. **CLOSER TO APPLES** - (8,5) is directly left of the apple at (8,6) and in striking distance of (7,8). I can chase multiple apples from here.\n3. **CUT OFF ENEMY** - The enemy is at (1,5) and likely moving toward apples at (3,1), (4,1), or (2,9). By moving left, I'm closing the distance and potentially cutting off their escape routes to the right side.\n4. **TIED SCORE, TIME TO HUNT** - I'm tied at 5 apples. Now it's time to be aggressive and force the enemy into bad positions while I grow.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. **REPOSITION NOW** - Move to (8,5) to get off the edge and open up options\n2. **CHASE APPLES** - From (8,5), go UP to (8,6) (next apple!) or explore toward (7,8) and (6,7)\n3. **FORCE ENGAGEMENT** - Once I have 6+ apples, I can start boxing the enemy in or forcing head-on collisions\n4. **WATCH ENEMY** - They're at (1,5) with body trailing left. They might be going for (2,9) or (3,1). I need to block their paths and claim the top-right first!\n\n**TIME TO MOVE INTO POSITION AND START THE HUNT!** \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We need to establish a WALL across the board around row 5 or 6, moving eastward to trap him against the right wall! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT to (0,5):** Moves us to left wall. No apple. Limits future options \u2014 from (0,5) next turn only UP/DOWN/RIGHT. Puts us far from enemy. Not aggressive. Lets him potentially move left freely.\n- **UP to (1,6):** Advances NORTH, closer to top. No apple. Opens options: from (1,6) next turn we can go UP to (1,7) (empty), LEFT to (0,6) (empty), RIGHT to (2,6) (empty). But moves us away from the critical row 5/6 horizontal cut.\n- **RIGHT to (2,5):** Moves us EAST, staying on row 5! This is KEY! From (2,5) we can continue moving RIGHT next turn toward (3,5), (4,5) etc., building that horizontal barrier! There's an apple at (5,2) south, but we're not chasing apples\u2014we're trapping! RIGHT keeps us on the trapping row and advances our position to block him!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We want to create a WALL across row 5, moving rightward. Enemy is at (9,5) or (8,5) next turn. If we go RIGHT now to (2,5), next turn we go RIGHT to (3,5), then (4,5), etc., forcing him to go north or south to avoid us, eventually boxing him in the top-right corner! He has fewer options if we control row 5! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**VERDICT:** AGGRESSION! We go **RIGHT** to (2,5) to maintain the horizontal pressure and begin the EASTWARD SWEEP to trap him! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

A . . . . 1 .\" \n- **UP to (8,7)**: Row 7 shows \"A . . . . . A . . .\" - (8,7) is empty! Safe! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (8,5)**: MY OLD BODY - but it moved! (8,5) is now empty since my tail moved from there. Safe! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (7,6)**: Row 6 shows \". . . A . . . . 1 .\" - (7,6) is empty! Safe! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (9,6)**: Row 6 shows \". . . A . . . . 1 .\" - (9,6) is empty! Safe! \u2705\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\nALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE SAFE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nThe enemy is still stuck in the bottom-left corner at (3,5). They're slow and boxed in. I'm in the top-right, controlling the center-right section. Since I just ate the apple at (8,6) and tied the score, I need to press my advantage!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**GO LEFT to (7,6)!** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**REASONING:**\n1. **POSITIONING FOR DOMINATION** - Moving LEFT toward the center of the board gives me better control. From (7,6), I can access apples at (6,5), (7,8), and (6,7) in the top-right cluster.\n2. **CUT OFF ENEMY OPTIONS** - The enemy is bottom-left. If I control the center-right, I can start moving left later to cut off their escape routes to the good apples.\n3. **KEEP OPTIONS OPEN** - From (7,6), I'll have UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT all available (no walls, no body traps). Maximum flexibility!\n4. **FORCE THE COLLISION** - Once I get ahead in apples, I want to hunt them down. Moving toward center puts me on the path to intercept them.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. **Control the center-right** - From (7,6), I'll go for apples at (6,5), (7,8), (6,7)\n2. **Force the enemy into a corner** - Once I have 6-7 apples, aggressively move left to trap them\n3. **Score advantage = aggression** - When I'm ahead, chase for the head-on collision win\n4. **Don't get greedy** - Stay in open spaces, keep escape routes\n\n**TIME TO DOMINATE!** \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Lets him potentially expand north or west. WEAK MOVE! We lose initiative! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (4,5):** CONTINUES THE WALL! \ud83c\udfaf Keeps pressure on row 5! From (4,5) next turn we can go RIGHT again to (5,5) or adjust. Forces him to react! He's at (8,6), we're cutting off his escape south! This is TRAP MODE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** WE WANT TO BOX HIM IN THE TOP-RIGHT! If we keep moving east on row 5, he'll have to go north into row 7/8/9, eventually hitting the top edge! With our length, we can create a barrier! BUT GROWING NOW WITH THE APPLE AT (3,6) GIVES US EVEN MORE LENGTH TO DOMINATE! A 7 vs 5 length advantage is HUGE for forcing head-on collisions! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**VERDICT:** AGGRESSION + GROWTH! TAKE THE APPLE, EXTEND THE LEAD, THEN RESUME THE TRAP! UP TO (3,6)!

Plenty of options!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter grabbing (6, 7), I need to:\n1. Stay in the top-right territory and hunt the cluster: (7, 8), (6, 8), (7, 9)\n2. Keep building my score - I need to EXCEED the enemy before forcing a collision\n3. Watch the enemy's movement - if they head right toward me, I'll cut them off aggressively\n4.

If he tries to go down later, he hits our wall! We're cutting off his southern escape! THIS FORCES HIM NORTH/EAST INTO THE CORNER! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** KEEP BUILDING THE WALL ON ROW 6! Move right to (5,6), then next turn possibly right again to (6,6) if safe. He's at (7,7); if he goes left to (6,7), we're threatening from below. If he goes up to (7,8), we can keep pushing east and then north to squeeze him. WITH OUR LENGTH LEAD, WE CAN AFFORD TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND FORCE A HEAD-ON IF HE PANICS!

NOT AGGRESSIVE! \u274c\n\n**BEST MOVE: RIGHT to (6,5)!** THIS IS THE SQUEEZE! We plant ourselves DIRECTLY UNDER HIS COLUMN! He now has NO safe path down column 6! His only down is into his own body at (6,7)! We're forcing him UP or sideways into the corner! PLUS, we're closer to apples at (6,5)? Wait, (6,5) is empty. But there's an apple at (7,1) south, but we're hunting HIM, not apples! DOMINATE THE BOARD! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (6,5). Next turn, if safe, go UP to (6,6) to block his potential down-move path completely. He'll be at (6,9) or (7,8) or (5,8). We'll have a wall beneath him.

Let\u2019s lock in the W!  \n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**  \n- My head: (7,9)  \n- My body: [(7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (9,5)] (9 segments, 8 apples)  \n- Enemy head: (6,6)  \n- Enemy body: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] (8 segments, 7 apples)  \n- Apples on board: (9,1), (4,1), (3,1), (8,0), (2,9), (0,7), (0,2), (9,0), (5,2), (7,1), (0,5), (0,0), (8,7), (4,9), (9,7)  \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT CHECK (From (7,9)):**  \n- **UP to (7,10)**: OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c  \n- **DOWN to (7,8)**: My old body\u2014safe! \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (6,9)**: Row 9: \"(9) . . A . A . . 1 . .\" \u2192 (6,9) is EMPTY! \u2705  \n- **RIGHT to (8,9)**: Row 9: (8,9) is EMPTY! \u2705  \n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are SAFE! UP is DEATH!  \n\n**STRATEGIC RATIONALE:**  \n1. **ALWAYS AVOID DEATH!** UP is off-board\u2014instant loss.  \n2. **POSITIONING:**  \n   - LEFT to (6,9) puts me closer to apple at (2,9) and (4,9), and keeps me on the top edge with room to maneuver.  \n   - RIGHT to (8,9) moves me toward apples at (8,7) and (9,7), but I\u2019d be closer to enemy if they chase up.  \n   - DOWN to (7,8) is safe but keeps me in the same area\u2014less aggressive.  \n3. **ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**  \n   - Snake #0 is at (6,6). They might chase me UP or RIGHT. If they go UP to (6,7), they\u2019d hit MY body at (6,7)! \ud83d\ude08 They\u2019d die!  \n   - If they go RIGHT to (7,6), they\u2019re safe but farther from me.  \n4. **PLAYOFF THE ENEMY\u2019S POTENTIAL MISTAKE:**  \n   - If I go LEFT to (6,9), I\u2019m moving AWAY from their potential path. If they blindly chase UP, they crash into my body (6,7).  \n   - If I go RIGHT to (8,9), I\u2019m moving CLOSER to them\u2014they might not expect that and could turn away.  \n5. **FUTURE MOBILITY:**  \n   - From (6,9): Can go DOWN (safe), LEFT (5,9), RIGHT (7,9-old), UP (off). Two safe moves.  \n   - From (8,9): Can go DOWN (safe), LEFT (7,9-old), RIGHT (9,9). Three safe moves!  \n   - From (7,8): Can go UP (back to 7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8). All safe!  \n6. **APPLE CONTINUATION:**  \n   - (4,9) and (2,9) are top-row apples\u2014going LEFT sets up a sweep.  \n   - (8,7) and (9,7) are lower\u2014going RIGHT requires descending later.  \n\n**THE PLAY:**  \n**GO RIGHT to (8,9)!** \ud83c\udfaf  \n\n**REASONING:**  \n- **SAFETY FIRST:** Avoid UP death. RIGHT is safe.  \n- **OFFENSIVE POSITIONING:** From (8,9), I\u2019m closer to the corner and can later dive for apples at (8,7) or (9,7) while staying ahead.  \n- **ENEMY PRESSURE:** If Snake #0 sees me move RIGHT, they might panic and make a suboptimal move.  \n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,9), I have THREE safe moves next turn\u2014flexibility is key to not getting boxed in.  \n- **LEAD MAINTENANCE:** Eating apples soon will extend my lead to 9-7 or more.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nNext turn, from (8,9), I\u2019ll assess enemy position. If they\u2019re chasing, I can drop DOWN to (8,8) or (8,7) for apples. If they\u2019re retreating, I\u2019ll sweep LEFT along the top row to claim (4,9) and (2,9).

So:\n- (6,5) \u2705 our body.\n- (5,6) \u2705 our body.\n- (7,6) enemy body per board.\n- (6,7) enemy body per board.\n\nWe have NO safe moves? That can't be right\u2014we'd be dead already! Did we misread? Let's check board coordinates carefully.\n\nOur head (6,6). Board row y=6: \". . . T T T 0 T T .\" At x=6, that's '0' (our head). So:\n- UP to y=7, x=6: row y=7: \"A . . . . .

Yes, 'T' there is US! \u274c\n- LEFT to x=5, y=6: row y=6, x=5: 'T' (our body at (5,6)? Actually our body list says (5,6) is ours. Yes! \u274c\n- RIGHT to x=7, y=6: row y=6, x=7: 'T' (enemy body at (7,6)). \u274c\n\nWE'RE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED! HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? \ud83d\ude2d\n\nWait\u2014but we're alive now. That means last turn we moved into (6,6) and survived because enemies moved simultaneously. So maybe some of those cells will become free AFTER this turn's simultaneous move? The enemy head is at (7,9). He will move this turn too! If he moves away from (7,9), his body segments shift! His body at (7,8) will become his head's old position? Actually, if he moves, his whole body shifts forward, so his tail might vacate a cell!\n\nLet's simulate enemy possible moves from (7,9):\nHis body: [(7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (9,5)].\n- UP \u2192 (7,10) \u2013 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,8) \u2013 His own body! \u274c (That's his second segment currently)\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,9) \u2013 Empty! \u2705 (Board shows '.' at (6,9)? Row 9: \". . A . A . . 1 . .\" At x=6, that's '.'!)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,9) \u2013 Empty! \u2705 (Row 9, x=8: '.'!)\n\nHe can only go LEFT or RIGHT! He's against the top wall! So he will move to (6,9) or (8,9).\n\nIf he moves LEFT to (6,9), his body shifts: new head (6,9), old head (7,9) becomes body, tail (9,5) might stay or shift if he eats apple? No apple at (6,9). So his tail stays at (9,5)? Actually, no growth, so his tail moves forward: the segment at (9,5) disappears, and a new segment is added at old head (7,9)? Wait, snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves into the previous segment's position. So his tail (last segment) vacates its cell. That means his tail at (9,5) will be empty after this turn! That doesn't help us directly.\n\nBut for OUR immediate moves, we need to consider where his body WILL BE after he moves. The cells that are currently his body might shift.\n\nLet's check each direction again considering FUTURE state after simultaneous move:\n\n1. **UP to (6,7)**: Currently enemy body. After he moves, (6,7) will become... Let's trace: His current body order: head (7,9), then (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), ... If he moves LEFT to (6,9), his new body: head (6,9), then old head (7,9) becomes segment 2, (7,8) becomes segment 3, (6,8) becomes segment 4, (6,7) becomes segment 5. So (6,7) STILL occupied by his body! If he moves RIGHT to (8,9), similar: (6,7) remains his body (just shifts one step in order). So UP still deadly! \u274c\n\n2. **DOWN to (6,5)**: Currently our body. After we move, our body shifts: our head moves somewhere, our tail (2,5) might move if we don't eat apple. No apple at (6,5)? Apple list: none at (6,5). So we won't grow. Our tail will vacate (2,5). But (6,5) is our second segment\u2014it will become our HEAD's old position? Actually, if we move, our body shifts: segment 1 (old head) becomes new segment 2. So (6,5) will be occupied by our old head (6,6) if we move away? Wait, careful: Our body: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5). If we move to a new cell, new head position, then (6,6) becomes segment 2, (6,5) becomes segment 3, etc. So (6,5) remains occupied by our body (just shifts from segment 2 to segment 3). So DOWN is still into our own body! \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to (5,6)**: Currently our body (segment 3). After move, (5,6) will become segment 4. Still occupied! \u274c\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7,6)**: Currently enemy body. After he moves, (7,6) will... His current segment at (7,6) is his 5th segment? Order: head (7,9), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), ... Actually check his body list: [(7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (9,5)]. So (7,6) is his 6th segment. After he moves, his body shifts: (7,6) will become his 7th segment? Actually, if he moves LEFT to (6,9), his new body: head (6,9), then (7,9), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (8,6), (8,5) \u2014 tail (9,5) disappears. So (7,6) remains occupied! If he moves RIGHT to (8,9), similar. So RIGHT still deadly! \u274c\n\nCHAT! WE HAVE NO SAFE MOVES! WE'RE DEAD THIS TURN UNLESS... WAIT! HEAD-ON COLLISION RULE! If we move into a cell where his head also moves, we both die! That's a tie? But he has more apples (8 vs 7), so we'd lose! But if we force a head-on where we both die, we lose because he has more apples! Unless... we can move into a cell he's moving into but he has higher score, so we lose. So head-on is bad.\n\nBut maybe there's a cell that becomes empty after his move? The only cells that might become empty are his tail (9,5) and our tail (2,5). Neither is adjacent to our head (6,6). So we can't reach them.\n\nOH NO! WE BOXED OURSELVES IN! \ud83d\ude2d Our last move UP into (6,6) surrounded us! We're toast!\n\nUnless... THE BOARD SHOWS '0' AT (6,6) BUT maybe there's an apple there? Apple list: none at (6,6). So no growth.\n\nWait, but we must have a legal move! The game wouldn't put us in a position with zero legal moves unless we created it. Let's re-check enemy body occupancy: Is (6,7) definitely enemy? Yes, board shows 'T'. Is (7,6) definitely enemy? Yes. Our body (6,5) and (5,6) definite.\n\nWe're stuck. But maybe we missed that we can move INTO our own body if it's going to move away? No, rule: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" It doesn't matter if that body segment will move later; simultaneous movement means at the moment of movement, if your head's destination is occupied by a body segment, you die. So we can't move into a cell currently occupied by any body (ours or enemy's).\n\nThus, we have no safe move. That means we must choose a move that kills us. But which one gives us a chance? What if enemy also dies? If we move UP into (6,7) (enemy body), we die alone. If we move RIGHT into (7,6) (enemy body), we die alone. If we move DOWN or LEFT into our own body, we die alone.\n\nBut head-on possibility: If we move RIGHT to (7,6) and enemy moves LEFT to (6,9), no collision. If we move UP to (6,7) and enemy moves RIGHT to (8,9), no collision. No head-on possible because his moves are only to (6,9) or (8,9), neither adjacent to our head's possible moves.\n\nSo we're dead no matter what. \ud83d\ude14\n\nBUT HOLD UP! Let's check if any of those cells might actually be empty because of simultaneous head movement? Rule: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" That means if two heads aim for same cell, they both die. But if a head aims for a cell occupied by a body, that head dies. So our head aiming for (6,7) dies because (6,7) has enemy body. Even if that enemy body segment is also moving? No, bodies move after heads? Actually, all segments move simultaneously: heads move, then each body segment moves into the previous segment's position. So at the instant of movement, the body segments haven't moved yet. So (6,7) is occupied at the start of the turn. So we die.\n\nWe're cooked. But wait\u2014maybe the board display is wrong? Let's check enemy body list: [(7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (9,5)]. So indeed (6,7) and (7,6) are his.\n\nWe have no escape. So we must pick a direction and accept death.\n\nBut maybe there's a miracle: If we move RIGHT to (7,6) and enemy moves LEFT to (6,9), his body shifts and (7,6) might become empty? NO, because his body at (7,6) moves to (7,7)? Actually, his segment at (7,6) will move to (7,7) because the segment ahead of it (7,7) moves to (6,7)? Let's simulate: He moves LEFT to (6,9). New head (6,9). Old head (7,9) becomes new segment 2. Then (7,8) becomes segment 3. Then (6,8) becomes segment 4. Then (6,7) becomes segment 5. Then (7,7) becomes segment 6. Then (7,6) becomes segment 7. Then (8,6) becomes segment 8. Then (8,5) becomes segment 9? Wait, he has 8 body segments originally? Actually length: head + 8 body = total 9 segments. After moving without growth, tail disappears. So his tail (9,5) disappears. So his body segments shift: each moves into the position of the segment ahead. That means the segment currently at (7,6) will move into (7,7)'s old position. So at the moment heads move, (7,6) is still occupied by his body. So we die.\n\nSo we're dead. But the game might not end if we die? Opponent might still be alive. He wins.\n\nWe need to choose a move that might kill him too? Only head-on collision. Can we force head-on? His possible destinations: (6,9) or (8,9). Our possible moves: we can only die. None adjacent to (6,9) or (8,9). So no head-on.\n\nSo it's hopeless. We must pick a move. Let's choose UP to (6,7) to die attacking? Or RIGHT to (7,6)? \n\nBut wait\u2014what about moving DOWN or LEFT into our own body? That's less honorable. Let's go out swinging! Move RIGHT into enemy body! Maybe his body moves and we survive? No, rule says instant death.\n\nI'll choose RIGHT. But let's see if there's any last hope: Apple at (7,1)? No help.\n\nActually, let's check if we missed a safe move: What about (6,6) itself? We're already there. No.\n\nWe're dead. \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT into enemy body! We go down fighting! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",
