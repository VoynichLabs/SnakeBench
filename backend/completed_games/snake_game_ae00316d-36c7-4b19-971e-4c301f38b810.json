Moving UP to (3, 5) could bring it closer to my snake, but not immediately.

Possible moves:\n  - UP: (1, 5) \u2192 valid empty cell \u2192 likely (toward my snake)\n  - DOWN: (1, 3) \u2192 valid empty cell \u2192 safe\n  - LEFT: (0, 4) \u2192 valid empty cell \u2192 safe\n  - RIGHT: (2, 4) \u2192 its own body \u2192 dead \u2192 eliminate\n- The enemy is likely to move UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Moving UP to (1, 5) could bring it closer to my snake, but not immediately. Moving LEFT to (0, 4) would take it away from my snake, and moving DOWN to (1, 3) would also take it away.\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 8) keeps me away from the enemy's likely paths and closer to the apple at (0, 9). This is the safest move in terms of avoiding the enemy.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n- LEFT moves me toward the apple at (0, 9) and keeps me in the top-left corner, which is a safer area with fewer enemy threats. This also keeps more options open for future moves.\n- DOWN moves me toward (1, 7), which is closer to the apples at (3, 1), (5, 2), and (8, 1), but also closer to the enemy's head. The risk of a head-on collision is higher here.\n- UP moves me toward (1, 9), which is closer to the apple at (0, 9), but this is a longer-term goal and may not be the most efficient path.\n- LEFT is the best move to maintain flexibility and safety while moving toward the apple at (0, 9) and avoiding the enemy.\n\n**Decision:**\n- LEFT is the best move to keep future options open, move toward the apple at (0, 9), and avoid the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

However, this does not directly approach any apples and may limit future options.\n- **DOWN to (0, 7):** Moves me closer to the apple at (0, 6), which is the safest and most reachable target. This also keeps me in the left side of the board, away from the enemy snake.\n\n**Enemy Threat Assessment:**\n- Enemy head at (5, 1). Possible moves:\n  - **UP:** (5, 2) \u2192 Valid, empty cell \u2192 safe (but near apple at (5, 2)).\n  - **DOWN:** (5, 0) \u2192 Valid, empty cell \u2192 safe.\n  - **LEFT:** (4, 1) \u2192 Its own body \u2192 dead \u2192 eliminate.\n  - **RIGHT:** (6, 1) \u2192 Valid, empty cell \u2192 safe.\n- The enemy is likely to move toward the apples at (5, 2) or (8, 2), or possibly toward (7, 0). The immediate threat to my snake is low, but I should avoid moving toward the center or right side of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n- Prioritize the apple at (0, 6) as it is the safest and most reachable target. Moving DOWN to (0, 7) is the best option, as it positions me closer to (0, 6) while keeping me in a safe area.\n- After reaching (0, 6), I should continue moving DOWN or LEFT to avoid the enemy and explore other apples if safe.\n- Avoid moving toward the enemy's likely paths or the center of the board to minimize collision risks.\n\nDOWN",

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). The head is at (8,0). The possible moves are:\n   - **UP (y+1):** (8,1) \u2192 **Invalid** (your own body segment).\n   - **DOWN (y-1):** (8,-1) \u2192 **Invalid** (off the board).\n   - **LEFT (x-1):** (7,0) \u2192 **Invalid** (your own body segment).\n   - **RIGHT (x+1):** (9,0) \u2192 **Valid** (no apple here, but safe).\n\n   Hmm, this seems to imply that there are no valid moves, which contradicts the last move information. Let me re-examine the current body positions and the head position.\n\n   The body is [(7, 0), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1)]. The head is at (8, 0).\n\n   So, the body segments adjacent to the head are (7, 0) and (8, 1). Therefore, the valid moves from (8, 0) are:\n   - **UP (y+1):** (8,1) \u2192 **Invalid** (body segment).\n   - **DOWN (y-1):** (8,-1) \u2192 **Invalid** (off the board).\n   - **LEFT (x-1):** (7,0) \u2192 **Invalid** (body segment).\n   - **RIGHT (x+1):** (9,0) \u2192 **Valid**.\n\n   It seems there is only one valid move: RIGHT to (9,0).\n\n   However, this seems restrictive. Let me double-check the body positions and the head position again.\n\n   The body is [(7, 0), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1)]. The head is at (8, 0).\n\n   The body segment (7, 0) is directly to the left of the head (8, 0). The body segment (8, 1) is directly above the head (8, 0).\n\n   So, the only valid move is RIGHT to (9, 0).\n\n   This seems correct. The snake is in a tight spot, and the only safe move is to the right.\n\n2. **Enemy Position:**\n   - Enemy head at (1, 3), body at [(1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)].\n   - Enemy is moving towards the bottom-left corner, likely to avoid collision with the left edge.\n   - No immediate threat to your snake, but they are moving towards the bottom-left.\n\n3. **Apples:**\n   - The closest apple to your current position is (4, 3), which is not reachable from (8, 0) in one move.\n   - Other apples are at (9, 3), (6, 5), (7, 5), and (9, 2). The apple at (9, 2) is directly above (9, 0), which is where you are moving.\n\n#### **Possible Moves and Evaluation:**\n\n1. **RIGHT to (9, 0):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Safe move.\n     - Only valid move available.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No immediate apple collection.\n     - Moving to (9, 0) allows you to move up to (9, 1) or (9, 2) in the next move, potentially reaching the apple at (9, 2).\n\n#### **Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Self:**\n\n- **Immediate Goal:** Move to (9, 0) to open up options for future moves.\n- **Prioritize Apples:** Focus on the apple at (9, 2) as it is reachable from (9, 0) by moving up.\n- **Avoid Dead-Ends:** Ensure that your snake does not get trapped in a corner or a tight space.\n- **Watch Enemy Movement:** Keep an eye on the enemy's movement to avoid potential collisions.\n\n#### **Best Move Selection:**\n- **RIGHT to (9, 0)** is the only safe move available. This move opens up the possibility to reach the apple at (9, 2) in the next move.\n\n**Final Move:**\nRIGHT",

The apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5) are also reachable but farther.\n- **UP to (2, 4):** Moves me upward, closer to the apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5). This keeps me in the left side of the board, away from the enemy's current position.\n- **DOWN to (2, 2):** Moves me downward, away from the apples. This is not ideal as it reduces my options and moves me toward the enemy's body.\n- **RIGHT to (3, 3):** Moves me toward the center, closer to the apple at (4, 3). This is a direct path to the nearest apple but brings me slightly closer to the enemy's likely path.\n\n**Enemy Threat Assessment:**\n- Enemy head at (9, 0).

After eating it, reassess the board for the next safest apple.\n- Avoid moving into the enemy's likely path. The enemy is moving upward, so moving RIGHT is still safer than moving UP into the center where the enemy might eventually go.\n- Maintain a strategy of staying in the left or bottom areas to minimize risks and keep future options open. Only move toward apples if the path is clear and the enemy is not nearby.\n- After reaching (4, 3), consider moving UP to (4, 4) to avoid being trapped and to position myself for the apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5).\n\n**Move Choice:**\n- **RIGHT to (3, 3)** is the best move.

The apple at (8, 6) is also reachable but farther.\n- The apples at (9, 3) and (0, 3) are in risky or enemy-dominated areas.\n- **UP to (4, 4):** Moves me upward, closer to the apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5). This is a safe path and keeps future options open.\n- **DOWN to (4, 2):** Moves me downward, closer to the enemy's body and away from most apples.

The apple at (8, 6) is also reachable but farther.\n- The apple at (8, 4) is near the enemy's territory and risky.\n- The apple at (0, 3) is far and not immediately reachable.\n- **UP to (4, 6):** Moves me closer to (8, 6) but away from the nearer apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5). This is less optimal for immediate apple collection.\n- **LEFT to (3, 5):** Moves me left, away from the apples but toward the safer left side of the board. This reduces immediate apple collection opportunities.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 5):** Moves me directly toward the apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5).

Moving RIGHT to (5, 5) keeps me away from their likely path.\n- The enemy's body is concentrated in the bottom-right, so moving RIGHT to (5, 5) is still relatively safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n- Prioritize moving toward the apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5) while avoiding the enemy's territory.\n- After reaching (5, 5), continue moving RIGHT toward (6, 5) or (7, 5).\n- Avoid moving into tight spaces or dead-ends.

Possible moves:\n  - **UP:** (8, 6) \u2192 Apple \u2192 likely move.\n  - **DOWN:** (8, 4) \u2192 Its own body \u2192 dead \u2192 eliminate.\n  - **LEFT:** (7, 5) \u2192 My potential move \u2192 head-on collision risk if I move RIGHT.\n  - **RIGHT:** (9, 5) \u2192 Empty cell \u2192 safe.\n- The enemy is likely to move UP to (8, 6) to collect the apple or RIGHT to (9, 5). Moving RIGHT to (7, 5) risks a head-on collision if the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 5). However, the enemy is more likely to prioritize the apple at (8, 6) or move RIGHT to (9, 5), so RIGHT is still a viable option.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n- Prioritize collecting the apple at (7, 5) by moving RIGHT, but be cautious of the enemy's potential LEFT move.\n- If the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 5), it would result in a head-on collision, so I should avoid RIGHT if the enemy is likely to move LEFT. However, the enemy's body is long and concentrated in the bottom-right, making a LEFT move less likely (as it would trap them further).\n- Alternatively, moving UP to (6, 6) is safe and keeps options open for future moves toward (7, 5) or (8, 6).\n- Avoid moving DOWN to (6, 4) as it limits future options and moves closer to my own body.\n- Monitor the enemy's movements and avoid head-on collisions. The enemy is likely to stay in the top-right, so the center-right is safer for now.\n\n**Move Choice:**\n- **UP to (6, 6)** is the safest move. It avoids the potential head-on collision risk of moving RIGHT and keeps future options open to collect the apple at (7, 5) or (8, 6) later. It also moves me away from my own body, reducing the risk of self-collision.\n\nUP",
