Your body is:\n  - Head: **(3, 5)**\n  - Body: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2)]\n  - Length: 5 (no growth this turn; last apple was at **(4, 5)** on Turn 13).\n- Apples remaining: **(1, 4), (2, 3), (8, 9), (4, 7), (9, 7)**.\n- Enemy (ID 1) is likely at **(7, 6)** or **(6, 5)** based on their last position **(7, 5)** and possible moves (**UP** or **LEFT**).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Apple Prioritization:**\n   - **(2, 3)** is now directly **DOWN** from your current position **(3, 5)**. This is the closest apple and can be eaten in **1 move**.\n   - **(1, 4)** is reachable in 2 moves (**LEFT** then **DOWN**), but **(2, 3)** is more urgent.\n   - **(4, 7)** is farther but could be a good long-term target if the enemy doesn\u2019t block it.\n   - **(8, 9)** and **(9, 7)** are too far for now.\n\n2. **Enemy Behavior:**\n   - If the enemy moved **UP** from **(7, 5)**, they are now at **(7, 6)** and may target **(7, 7)** or **(6, 6)**.\n   - If they moved **LEFT** from **(7, 5)**, they are now at **(6, 5)** and may target **(5, 5)** or **(6, 4)**.\n   - Neither path directly conflicts with your path to **(2, 3)**.\n\n3. **Snake Growth:**\n   - Eating **(2, 3)** will grow your snake to length 6 and increase your score to 5.\n   - This positions you well for future moves toward **(1, 4)** or **(4, 7)**.\n\n4. **Avoid Collisions:**\n   - Your body is at **(4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2)**. Avoid moving **UP** to **(3, 6)** if the enemy is there (unlikely but possible).\n   - Avoid moving **RIGHT** to **(4, 5)** (your body).\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Next 3 Moves):**\n1. **Turn 14:** Move **DOWN** to **(2, 5)** \u2192 Wait, no! **(2, 3)** is **DOWN** from **(3, 3)**, but your head is at **(3, 5)**. Oops, misread! Correct path:\n   - **Turn 14:** Move **DOWN** to **(2, 5)** \u2192 No, that\u2019s not helpful. Actually, **(2, 3)** is **DOWN** from **(3, 3)**, but your head is at **(3, 5)**. You need to adjust your path.\n   - **Correction:** To reach **(2, 3)**, you need to move **DOWN** to **(2, 5)**, then **LEFT** to **(2, 4)**, then **DOWN** to **(2, 3)**. That\u2019s 3 moves, not 1. My mistake!\n   - **Revised Plan:**\n     - **Turn 14:** Move **DOWN** to **(2, 5)** (positions you closer to **(2, 3)**).\n     - **Turn 15:** Move **LEFT** to **(2, 4)**.\n     - **Turn 16:** Move **DOWN** to **(2, 3)** to eat the apple.\n   - Alternatively, if you move **LEFT** to **(2, 5)** first, you can then move **DOWN** to **(2, 3)** in 2 moves. But your head is at **(3, 5)**, so **LEFT** to **(2, 5)** is safe and positions you well.\n\n   **Better Plan:**\n   - **Turn 14:** Move **LEFT** to **(2, 5)** (safe, no body or enemy blocking).\n   - **Turn 15:** Move **DOWN** to **(2, 4)**.\n   - **Turn 16:** Move **DOWN** to **(2, 3)** to eat the apple.\n\n   This avoids unnecessary moves and keeps you flexible.\n\n5. **Alternative Apple Targets:**\n   - If you cannot reach **(2, 3)** safely (e.g., enemy blocks), consider **(1, 4)** next. It\u2019s reachable in 2 moves (**LEFT** twice then **DOWN**).\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- Moving **LEFT** to **(2, 5)** is safe and keeps you on track for **(2, 3)**.\n- The enemy\u2019s position does not block this move, so no immediate conflict.\n- After eating **(2, 3)**, you can pivot toward **(1, 4)** or **(4, 7)** without risk.\n\n---\n### **Analysis of Current Move (Turn 14)**\nFrom **(3, 5)**, possible safe moves:\n- **UP:** **(4, 5)** \u2192 Your body. **Fatal.**\n- **DOWN:** **(3, 4)** \u2192 Your body. **Fatal.**\n- **LEFT:** **(2, 5)** \u2192 Safe and positions you well for **(2, 3)**.\n- **RIGHT:** **(4, 5)** \u2192 Your body. **Fatal.**\n\n**Best Move:** **LEFT** to **(2, 5)**.\n- **Why?**\n  - Positions you optimally to reach **(2, 3)** in the next 2 moves (**DOWN** to **(2, 4)**, then **DOWN** to **(2, 3)**).\n  - Avoids the enemy\u2019s likely paths and keeps flexibility.\n  - Prepares you for future moves toward **(1, 4)** or **(4, 7)**.\n\n---\n**Final Move:**\nLEFT",
