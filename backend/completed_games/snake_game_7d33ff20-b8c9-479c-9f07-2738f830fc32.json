No immediate collision.\n\n   Safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n3) Among safe moves, consider:\n   - Apples: (5,8), (6,7), (0,8), (4,2), (9,4). The closest apples are (0,8) (distance 2), (5,8) (distance 3), and (6,7) (distance 4). The apple at (4,2) is distance 6, and (9,4) is distance 8.\n   - Enemy position: Head at (5,6), body at [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4)]. The enemy could move UP to (5,7), DOWN to (5,5) (invalid, body), LEFT to (4,6), or RIGHT to (6,6). The most likely moves are UP to (5,7) or RIGHT to (6,6).\n   - Future options:\n     - UP to (2,9) moves me to the top edge, which is risky but keeps me close to the apple at (0,8) and (5,8). It also avoids the enemy's likely paths.\n     - LEFT to (1,8) moves me closer to the apple at (0,8) and keeps me away from the enemy.

RIGHT to (3,8) could be risky if the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,6), but (3,8) is still safe for now. UP to (2,9) is safe but moves me to the edge. LEFT to (1,8) is safe and moves me toward the apple at (0,8).\n   - Avoid edges: LEFT is closer to the edge than UP or RIGHT, but still safe.\n\n5) Best move: LEFT to (1,8). This moves me directly toward the apple at (0,8), keeps me safe from the enemy's likely paths, and maintains flexibility to target the apple at (5,8) or (0,8) in future turns. It also avoids the top edge, which could be a dead-end.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving LEFT to (1,8), target the apple at (0,8). If the enemy moves toward (5,7) or (6,6), I can continue to move LEFT to (0,8) or adjust my path to avoid collision. Always prioritize safety and avoid edges.

The apples at (3, 2) and (4, 2) are also reachable.\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 9) keeps more options open and avoids the left edge, which could be a dead-end.\n- After moving RIGHT, I can reassess the board for the next closest apple, likely targeting (3, 8) or (4, 2).\n- Monitor the enemy's position to avoid head-on collisions or being trapped.\n\nRIGHT",

The closest apples are (1, 3), (5, 5), and (8, 7).\n- The enemy's head is at (3, 2), and their body is clustered in the right half of the board, especially from (4, 2) to (9, 4).\n- The apple at (3, 2) was eaten by the enemy last turn, so it is no longer present.\n\n**Possible Moves from (3, 7):**\n1. UP: (3, 8) - Invalid (my body)\n2. DOWN: (3, 6) - Valid (on board, no immediate collision)\n3. LEFT: (2, 7) - Valid (on board, no immediate collision)\n4. RIGHT: (4, 7) - Valid (on board, no immediate collision)\n\nValid moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Analysis of Valid Moves:**\n- DOWN to (3, 6):\n  - Moves me toward the apple at (1, 3) or (5, 0).\n  - The enemy's head is at (3, 2), and their body is mostly on the right side, so this move keeps me away from their immediate path.\n  - Future moves could target (1, 3) or (5, 0), but I need to ensure I don't get trapped in the bottom-left corner.\n- LEFT to (2, 7):\n  - Moves me toward the apple at (1, 3).\n  - This is a direct path to (1, 3), but I need to ensure I don't get trapped after eating it.\n  - The enemy's head is at (3, 2), so this move keeps me away from their immediate vicinity.\n- RIGHT to (4, 7):\n  - Moves me toward the apple at (5, 5) or (8, 7).\n  - The enemy's body is mostly on the right side, so this move could lead to a collision if I'm not careful.\n  - The apple at (5, 5) is closer, but the enemy's body is blocking the path to (8, 7).\n  - This move might limit my future options if the enemy moves toward me.\n\n**Enemy Movement Consideration:**\n- The enemy's head is at (3, 2). Their possible moves:\n  - UP: (3, 3) - Valid (no immediate collision).\n  - DOWN: (3, 1) - Valid.\n  - LEFT: (2, 2) - Valid.\n  - RIGHT: (4, 2) - Invalid (their body).\n- The enemy is likely to move toward the apples at (1, 3) or (5, 0), so I should avoid moving into their path.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- The apple at (1, 3) is the closest and most reachable. Moving LEFT to (2, 7) sets me up to move toward (1, 3) in the next turn.\n- After eating (1, 3), I can reassess the board for the next closest apple, likely (5, 0) or (5, 5).\n- Avoid the enemy's head and body, especially near (3, 2) and (4, 2), as they are likely to target the apples in that area.\n- Keep space open to maneuver, avoiding tight corners or dead-ends.\n\n**Decision:**\n- LEFT is the best move as it moves me toward the closest apple (1, 3) and keeps future options open while avoiding the enemy's likely path.\n\nLEFT",
