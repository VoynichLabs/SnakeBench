Then they are adjacent to both (6,3) and us, and will beat us to (6,3), likely ending up with both central apples and a material lead.\n\n- DOWN: We move away to (5,2). Enemy still takes (6,4) this turn, and then easily grabs (6,3) next, again claiming both central apples while we drift away.\n\n- RIGHT: We move to (6,3) and take the apple. None of enemy’s legal moves (DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,5), RIGHT to (7,5)) collide with (6,3) this turn, so it’s safe. If enemy goes DOWN to (6,4) for their apple, we end up:\n  - Our snake: head (6,3), body (5,3),(4,3)\n  - Enemy: head (6,4), body (6,5),(6,6)\n\nFrom there, we’re closer than them to both remaining central apples at (9,3) and (7,1), and we have at least two safe continuations (RIGHT toward (9,3) or DOWN toward (7,1)). Any attempt by them to move DOWN into (6,3) next turn would run their head into our body and kill them, so the column under them becomes “ours.”\n\nSo RIGHT both safely secures an apple now and gives us future positional advantage and apple access.\n\nLong-term note to self: After taking (6,3), prefer to extend along row 3 toward (9,3) unless the enemy’s response opens a cleaner route down toward (7,1). Maintain lateral space; don’t climb directly into column 6 above the enemy where head-on collisions are more likely. Use the threat of them stepping down into our body at (6,3) to limit their options.\n\nRIGHT",

After movement, every legal enemy move (DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,4), or RIGHT to (7,4)) results in our head occupying a square that becomes part of their body, or in mutual body collisions. In all cases, we die (or both die). UP is effectively suicidal.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,3)**: Safe against all enemy moves.  \n  - If enemy goes DOWN to (6,3), their head moves into our new body segment and they die; we survive.  \n  - If enemy goes LEFT or RIGHT, there’s no collision.  \n  This gives us an excellent route to the apple at (9,3) and good central control, but we don’t gain an apple immediately, leaving the score tied 2–2 for now.\n\n- **DOWN to (6,2)**: There is an apple at (6,2). Moving here:\n  - We safely eat the apple and grow; our new body is [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)].\n  - If enemy goes DOWN to (6,3), their head enters our body and they die while we live.\n  - If enemy goes LEFT to (5,4) or RIGHT to (7,4), there is no collision at all.\n  We gain a point immediately (3–2 lead) and end up with three safe follow-up options (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). We stay in a very open bottom area with easy access to the nearby apple cluster at (7,1) and (8,2).\n\nBetween the two safe moves, **DOWN** both increases our score right now and keeps our future options wide while pushing us away from direct head-on skirmishes. The small extra length doesn’t meaningfully reduce our mobility on this open board, and taking an early apple lead is strategically valuable.\n\n**Long-term note to self:**  \nAfter moving DOWN and taking (6,2), prioritize collecting the nearby bottom apples at (7,1) and (8,2) while staying out of tight vertical alignments directly under the enemy. Use the fact that they risk suicide if they step down into our body to limit their approach, and only contest (9,3) if the enemy’s next move doesn’t clearly beat us there.\n\nDOWN",
