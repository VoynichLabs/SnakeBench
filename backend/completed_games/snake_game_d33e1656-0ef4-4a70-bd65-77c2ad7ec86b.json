          "rationale": "Chat, what is up?! We are officially LIVE in the arena, and you know we came to DOMINATE! It's Turn 0, we're fresh off the starting line, and we have Snake #1 sitting up there on the right side. Our goal? Box this dude in and crash him out! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRight now, we are at (8, 3), and Snake #1 is at (9, 5). We are diagonally separated but on the same vertical axis as the board edge. Both of us are length 1. We gotta establish presence early!\n\n### **Game Plan: Turn 1 (Initial Aggression)**\n\nWe need to start moving toward the center or toward the enemy, while also grabbing some sweet, sweet content (apples!).\n\n**OUR HEAD:** (8, 3)\n\n**Available Moves & Safety Check:**\n\n1.  **UP (8, 4):** Safe. Moves us closer to the enemy's side of the board and potential action.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 2):** Safe. Moves us away from the enemy and toward the bottom, away from current apples. Avoidance? Nah, we are aggressive!\n3.  **LEFT (7, 3):** Safe. Moves us into the open center. A good strategic move.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 3):** Safe. Moves us toward the wall, reducing options, but also closer to the right side where the enemy is.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (9, 5)):**\n\nSnake #1 is already at the extreme right edge. Their likely moves are UP (9, 6), DOWN (9, 4), or LEFT (8, 5). They won't move RIGHT (off board).\n\n*   If they go DOWN (9, 4), they are moving toward the bottom corner.\n*   If they go LEFT (8, 5), they are moving toward the center, closing the distance between us. This is the most aggressive move for them.\n*   If they go UP (9, 6), they are moving toward the top corner.\n\n**Where should we go?**\n\nWe need to secure territory and look for a way to cut him off.\n\nIf we go RIGHT (9, 3), we are hugging the wall, which is risky for long-term options, but we occupy the same x-axis as the opponent.\n\nIf we go UP (8, 4), we move closer to them and closer to the apples at (8, 8) and (7, 6). This move keeps our options open geographically.\n\nIf we go LEFT (7, 3), we access a massive open area and a clear path toward the core of the board. This is a solid, safe, and flexible positional move.\n\nSince the opponent is currently positioned to potentially move LEFT toward the center (8, 5), if we also move LEFT (7, 3), we maintain distance and flexibility. If we move UP (8, 4), we put ourselves in a position where we might be heading toward them, especially if they also move LEFT (8, 5) or DOWN (9, 4).\n\nGiven that we are both length 1, an early head-on collision is unlikely unless we both aim for the exact same spot, which is currently (8, 4), (9, 3), or (9, 4) depending on how the opponent moves.\n\nLet's prioritize: **Central control and cutting off the enemy's escape route.**\n\nMoving **LEFT (7, 3)** opens up the most possibilities for future turns to either go UP and challenge his movement, or continue LEFT and gain control of the lower section of the board. It avoids jamming ourselves against the right wall immediately. Also, look at the apples: (1, 3), (2, 3) are easy grabs if we go LEFT.\n\nLet's establish a strong position and force him to react to us! We are going for central domination, chat!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note:**\n\nFocus on moving toward the center-left side (x=1 to x=5) to spread out and grow large. Once we have some length, we'll push back toward the right side to try and trap Snake #1 against the wall or top edge. Avoid immediate collisions until we have a size advantage.\n\nLEFT",
