The apples are at (4, 5), (2, 1), (0, 7), (6, 6), and (9, 7). Moving up would bring me closer to the apple at (4, 5), but it's further away than the apple at (2, 1) if I move left. However, moving left would put me closer to the enemy snake at (9, 3).\n\nConsidering the current board state and the rules, I decide to move left (to position (-1, 2)) to get closer to an apple and potentially gain a point.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to avoid the enemy snake while moving towards an apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

Since the enemy snake is far away and not in my immediate path, I can safely move towards the apple.\n\nNext move: UP\n\nFor the next turn, I will continue to prioritize collecting apples while avoiding collisions with the enemy snake and the walls. I will also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements to anticipate any potential threats."
