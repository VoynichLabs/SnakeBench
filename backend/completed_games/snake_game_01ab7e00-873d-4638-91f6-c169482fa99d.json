The nearest apple is still at (7, 4), which is just 1 step to the right from my current position.\n\nMoving right towards that apple still seems like a good strategy, as it's very close and I can potentially eat it on the next move. However, I need to be cautious of snake #1's movements and position, as it's relatively close at (7, 5) with its body extending towards my current position.\n\nIf I move right to (7, 4) and snake #1 moves down, it could potentially cut me off or trap me against the wall. So while going for the closest apple is still a good goal, I need to be prepared to change directions or retreat if snake #1 makes any threatening moves.\n\nAnother option would be to move up towards the apple at (6, 6), which is 2 steps away from my current position. This would take me further away from snake #1 and its body for the moment, and potentially put me in a better position to access other apples like the one at (2, 7) or (1, 6) in the future.\n\nHowever, moving up would also take me slightly further away from the closest apple at (7, 4), so it's a bit of a trade-off between safety and efficiency.\n\nStrategy for this turn: I will take a cautious approach and move UP to (6, 5). This will move me slightly further away from snake #1 and its body, while still keeping me relatively close to the apple at (7, 4) in case an opportunity arises to safely go for it on a future turn.\n\nAfter this move, I'll need to carefully observe snake #1's movements and the overall board state, and decide whether to continue towards (7, 4), go for a different apple, or prioritize safety and positioning depending on how the game evolves.\n\nDecided next move: UP\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Observe snake #1's movements and the board state carefully. If it seems safe, consider moving towards the apple at (7, 4) or potentially the one at (2, 7) if a clear path opens up. However, prioritize safety and avoiding getting trapped or cut off by snake #1 and its body."

The apple at (7, 4) is now directly below us.\n   - The apples that remain apart from (7, 4) are at (3, 9), (2, 7), (9, 0), and (1, 6), all spread across the board.\n\n2. **Potential Moves from Current Position (7, 5):**\n   - **UP (7, 6):** Moving up is a safe option, keeping us under the potential path to pursue another apple after (7, 4), possibly leading towards (3, 9) or (2, 7).\n   - **RIGHT (8, 5):** Moving right would take us away from the immediate apple (7, 4) and is therefore not optimal for maximizing points quickly.\n   - **DOWN (7, 4):** Moving down takes us directly onto the apple at (7, 4), thereby increasing our length and point score. This is the most beneficial move currently.\n   - **LEFT (6, 5):** This could risk a collision with our body as it moves backwards.\n\n3. **Assessment of Enemy Snake Movement:**\n   - Snake #2 remains at a safe distance. Since it is at (6, 4) and the rest of its body is moving downwards away from our current location, immediate confrontation is avoided.\n   - If it moves up suddenly, it could get in our path to some other potential apples after (7, 4).\n\n4. **Strategic Consideration:**\n   - Given an opportunity to secure an apple directly below us, moving **DOWN to (7, 4)** is optimal. It positions us well, increases our length marginally, and fetches additional points.\n   - Keep future routes in mind to reach subsequent apples while ensuring not to box ourselves into corners or travel paths too congested by the enemy or our own body.\n\n5. **Forward Planning:**\n   - After securing the apple at (7, 4), reevaluate the position to decide on pursuing apples at (3, 9) or (2, 7). If Snake #2 starts to approach, adjust the course to a safer apple like (9, 0), and monitor if strategically beneficial pathways remain accessible.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"
