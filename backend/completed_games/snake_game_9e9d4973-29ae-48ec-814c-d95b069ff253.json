No apple.\n- DOWN to (6,5): The apple at (6,5) was eaten last turn (snake's body is now here), so no apple here now. Wait, based on info, the last move was moving onto (6,6) to eat the apple there. So the apple at (6,5) remains? The initial apple list said (6,5), but the board as given placed the apples at (5,4), (5,0), (1,4), (5,5), and (9,1). I do see the apple at (5,5) on the board; maybe the (6,5) apple was a mistake in the recap? The apple list is: (5,4), (5,0), (1,4), (5,5), (9,1). Not (6,5). The confusion is from the last message including (6,5) in the apple list, but the original apple positions do not include (6,5). Given the original board, (6,5) is our snake head's current position or body, so no apple there. **Conclusion: no apple at (6,5).**\n- LEFT to (5,6): This is part of our body; moving backward not allowed.\n- RIGHT to (7,6): Empty cell, no apple.\n\n**So:**\n\n- Moving DOWN (6,5) should be safe (no apple, but part of the body?), wait, the snake's body includes (6,5)? Last move was DOWN, previous body was (6,6), (5,6), (5,7). Since the snake grew, its tail probably remained in place. Let's check if moving DOWN to (6,5) means moving onto the body:\n\nYour snake is at:\n\nHead at (6,6)  \nBody [(6,5), (5,6), (5,7)]\n\nSo (6,5) is part of your body. Therefore, moving DOWN to (6,5) means collision with yourself: forbidden. So DOWN is not allowed.\n\n- UP (6,7) is safe and free.\n\n- RIGHT (7,6) is free.\n\n- LEFT (5,6) is part of the body, forbidden.\n\n**Next best move:**\n\n- Since DOWN and LEFT are forbidden/move onto your own body, move UP or RIGHT.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:\n\n- Moving UP (6,7):\n\n  Leads to safe spot, and closer to apple at (5, 7) is the body parts? There's body at (5,7), no apple there, so no direct target. But apples at (5,4) and (5,5) are south of this position, so moving UP slightly diverges from apple clusters, but it gives more maneuvering space.\n\n- Moving RIGHT (7,6):\n\n  Moves toward the right side, further from apple cluster.\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT, UP is slightly better because it keeps proximity to apple cluster on the left.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- DOWN: collides with self.\n\n- LEFT: collides with self.\n\n- RIGHT: safe, but less accessible to apples.\n\n- UP: safe, keeps apple cluster nearby.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMove UP.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn strategy:**\n\n- After moving UP to (6,7), next go DOWN again to target apple at (5,5) or (5,4).\n\n- Keep eyes on enemy snake at (2,4), which currently is distant.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move:** UP"

(6,7) appears empty.\n\n- **DOWN** to (6,5): This position has an apple.

            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n- The snake's head is at (6,6).\n- The body parts now likely are [(6,5), (5,6), (5,7)] following the last move, the snake has just eaten at (6,6) (previously the apple was at (6,6), now presumably gone).\n- Remaining apples are at (5,4), (5,0), (1,4), and (9,1).\n- Enemy snake is at (2,4) with body at [(2,3), (3,3)].\n\n**Possible moves:**\n\n- UP to (6,7): Board at (6,7) is free. No apple.\n- DOWN to (6,5): The apple at (6,5) was eaten last turn (snake's body is now here), so no apple here now. Wait, based on info, the last move was moving onto (6,6) to eat the apple there. So the apple at (6,5) remains? The initial apple list said (6,5), but the board as given placed the apples at (5,4), (5,0), (1,4), (5,5), and (9,1). I do see the apple at (5,5) on the board; maybe the (6,5) apple was a mistake in the recap? The apple list is: (5,4), (5,0), (1,4), (5,5), (9,1). Not (6,5). The confusion is from the last message including (6,5) in the apple list, but the original apple positions do not include (6,5). Given the original board, (6,5) is our snake head's current position or body, so no apple there. **Conclusion: no apple at (6,5).**\n- LEFT to (5,6): This is part of our body; moving backward not allowed.\n- RIGHT to (7,6): Empty cell, no apple.\n\n**So:**\n\n- Moving DOWN (6,5) should be safe (no apple, but part of the body?), wait, the snake's body includes (6,5)? Last move was DOWN, previous body was (6,6), (5,6), (5,7). Since the snake grew, its tail probably remained in place. Let's check if moving DOWN to (6,5) means moving onto the body:\n\nYour snake is at:\n\nHead at (6,6)  \nBody [(6,5), (5,6), (5,7)]\n\nSo (6,5) is part of your body. Therefore, moving DOWN to (6,5) means collision with yourself: forbidden. So DOWN is not allowed.\n\n- UP (6,7) is safe and free.\n\n- RIGHT (7,6) is free.\n\n- LEFT (5,6) is part of the body, forbidden.\n\n**Next best move:**\n\n- Since DOWN and LEFT are forbidden/move onto your own body, move UP or RIGHT.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:\n\n- Moving UP (6,7):\n\n  Leads to safe spot, and closer to apple at (5, 7) is the body parts? There's body at (5,7), no apple there, so no direct target. But apples at (5,4) and (5,5) are south of this position, so moving UP slightly diverges from apple clusters, but it gives more maneuvering space.\n\n- Moving RIGHT (7,6):\n\n  Moves toward the right side, further from apple cluster.\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT, UP is slightly better because it keeps proximity to apple cluster on the left.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- DOWN: collides with self.\n\n- LEFT: collides with self.\n\n- RIGHT: safe, but less accessible to apples.\n\n- UP: safe, keeps apple cluster nearby.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMove UP.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn strategy:**\n\n- After moving UP to (6,7), next go DOWN again to target apple at (5,5) or (5,4).\n\n- Keep eyes on enemy snake at (2,4), which currently is distant.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move:** UP"
