Apple locations are A: (7, 1), (9, 1), (3, 7), (0, 2), (1, 8).\nEnemy snake (ID 0) is at (8, 1).\n\nMy head is at $H_1 = (7, 8)$.\nEnemy head is at $H_0 = (8, 1)$.\nMy body is empty besides the head, so there is no immediate suicide risk from moving backwards into my own body, as my tail (the segment behind the head) doesn't exist yet.\n\nI need to evaluate moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Possible Next Positions ($N_1$):**\n*   **UP:** (7, 9). Valid boundary.\n*   **DOWN:** (7, 7). Valid boundary.\n*   **LEFT:** (6, 8). Valid boundary.\n*   **RIGHT:** (8, 8). Valid boundary.\n\n**Safety Check (Collision with Enemy Snake $S_0$):**\nEnemy $S_0$ head is at $H_0 = (8, 1)$. Since the enemy is far away, no move will result in an immediate collision with the enemy body or head this turn.\n\n**Apple Proximity/Gain:**\nApples are at: $A_1=(7, 1)$, $A_2=(9, 1)$, $A_3=(3, 7)$, $A_4=(0, 2)$, $A_5=(1, 8)$.\nMy current position is (7, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 9):** Does not reach any apple.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 7):** Does not reach any apple. It moves one step closer to $A_3=(3, 7)$.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 8):** Does not reach any apple. It moves one step closer to $A_5=(1, 8)$.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 8):** Does not reach any apple. It moves one step closer to $A_2=(9, 1)$, but Manhattan distance is high (1+7=8).\n\n**Evaluating Future Opportunities:**\n\nThe closest apple potentially visible is $A_5=(1, 8)$. Moving LEFT brings me to (6, 8), which is 5 steps away.\nThe next closest seems to be $A_3=(3, 7)$. Moving DOWN brings me to (7, 7), which is 4 steps away (straight line distance).\n\nSince I have no body segments, I have maximum maneuverability. I should prioritize a move that sets up a direct path to the nearest food while maintaining proximity to other food options.\n\nApple $A_5 = (1, 8)$ is on the same row as me (Y=8). Moving LEFT seems like a good start towards it.\n$H_1$: (7, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (1, 8) (Apple A5). Total 6 moves assuming no detours.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 7), I approach $A_3=(3, 7)$. It takes 4 steps left to reach X=3. Total 4 moves assuming no detours.\n\nLet's check the Manhattan distances:\nTo $A_5(1, 8)$: $|7-1| + |8-8| = 6$\nTo $A_3(3, 7)$: $|7-3| + |8-7| = 4+1 = 5$\nTo $A_4(0, 2)$: $|7-0| + |8-2| = 7+6 = 13$\nTo $A_1(7, 1)$: $|7-7| + |8-1| = 7$\nTo $A_2(9, 1)$: $|7-9| + |8-1| = 2+7 = 9$\n\n$A_3(3, 7)$ is the closest by Manhattan distance (5). The move DOWN to (7, 7) reduces this distance to 4. This seems like the best immediate path.\n\nThe enemy snake (8, 1) is not a threat currently. The priority is reaching $A_3$ by going DOWN.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Closest apple is (3, 7). Moving DOWN gets me one step closer to it while keeping me relatively central on the board.\n\nMove: DOWN\nThe next move after DOWN will likely be LEFT to get to X=3.\n(7, 8) --DOWN--> (7, 7) [Dist to A3: 4]\n(7, 7) --LEFT--> (6, 7) [Dist to A3: 3]\n(6, 7) --LEFT--> (5, 7) [Dist to A3: 2]\n(5, 7) --LEFT--> (4, 7) [Dist to A3: 1]\n(4, 7) --LEFT--> (3, 7) [Eat A3] - 5 turns if straight pathing is possible.\n\nDOWN seems optimal for maximizing shortest path to food.\n\nDOWN",

My body is still empty besides the head.\nEnemy snake $S_0$ moved from (9, 1) to (8, 1) last turn (which I incorrectly inferred in the previous turn's rationale, as the board shows $H_0=(9, 1)$ in the previous turn's summary, but the current board shows $H_0=(8, 1)$ and body $(8, 1)$. Wait, previous turn summary stated $H_0=(9, 1)$, Body: $[(8, 1)]$. If $S_0$ moved DOWN, $H_0$ would be $(9, 0)$ and Body $[(9, 1)]$. If $S_0$ moved LEFT, $H_0$ would be $(8, 1)$ and Body $[(9, 1)]$. The current board shows $H_0=(8, 1)$ and Body: $[(8, 1)]$ - this means $S_0$ *also* collected an apple at (8, 1) if its head ended up there and it grew, but the board shows $T0$ at (8, 1) and $H0$ at (9, 1) in the *previous* description.\n\nLet's re-examine the previous state derived from the board:\nPrevious Board (Turn 1 Start):\n$S_1$: (7, 8)\n$S_0$: Head (9, 1), Body [(8, 1)]\nApples included (7, 1), (3, 7), (0, 2), (1, 8), (5, 1).\n\nPrevious Rationale asserted $S_0$ head was (9, 1).\nIf $S_0$ moved LEFT, its new head would be (8, 1). Its body would shift: [(9, 1)]. $S_0$ would occupy (8, 1).\nIf $S_0$ moved DOWN, its new head would be (9, 0). Its body would shift: [(9, 1)].\n\nThe current board state shows:\n$S_1$ Head: (7, 7). (Confirmed by my DOWN move).\n$S_0$ Head: (8, 1). Body: [(8, 1)]. Apples: 1.\nThis structure for $S_0$ implies either:\n1. $S_0$ moved LEFT from (9, 1) to (8, 1), and its previous body segment (8, 1) was overwritten/removed, somehow resulting in a body of length 1 at the new head position, which contradicts standard growth rules unless it ate something or died/was incorrectly logged.\n2. $S_0$ was at $(x, y)$ and moved to $(8, 1)$ and ate an apple at $(8, 1)$. But there is no apple listed at $(8, 1)$ currently. The apples are (7, 1), (3, 7), (0, 2), (1, 8), (5, 1).\n\nGiven the current board state visualization:\nApple (7, 1) is present.\nApple (5, 1) is present.\nSnake 0 is at (8, 1) (Head T) and (8, 1) (Body 0). This representation is highly anomalous if the body coordinates should follow the head's path. Usually, if a snake has collected 1 apple, its length is 2 segments (Head + 1 body).\nIf $H_0=(8, 1)$, its body should be one segment behind it, say $(9, 1)$ from the previous turn.\nIf $S_0$ was at $(9, 1)$ with body $[(8, 1)]$.\nIf $S_0$ moved LEFT to $(8, 1)$, its body should become $[(9, 1)]$.\nThe visual representation shows: `1 . . . . . A . A T 0`\nT is the tail of $S_1$ (which is empty/new turn 1). Wait, T must denote the tail of $S_1$ *after* movement, but my snake is length 1 currently, so it has no tail segment listed beyond the head (7, 7). The `T 0` must refer to $S_0$'s tail segment.\nIf $S_0$ head is $H_0=(8, 1)$, and its body is $[(8, 1)]$, this means $S_0$ has length 2, and its segments overlap, which is impossible unless a segment was just collected *at* (8, 1) and the old tail was removed, *and* the old head $(9, 1)$ became the new body segment.\n\nLet's assume the board transcription means:\n$S_1$: Head (7, 7). Length 1.\n$S_0$: Head (8, 1). Body segment at (8, 1). (This means $S_0$ is length 2, with $H_0=(8, 1)$ and $B_0=(8, 1)$). This is still spatially invalid unless the game engine logged this weirdly.\n\nLet's ignore the explicit structure of $S_0$ body log `Body: [(8, 1)]` if it conflicts with the ASCII map, and rely on the map visualization:\n$S_0$ occupies (8, 1). Snake 0 appears to be length 1 (Head only, T0 marker).\nIf $S_0$ has 1 apple, it *must* be length 2. Let's assume the map shows $H_0$ at (8, 1) (marked '0') and some trailing segment $T_0$ is also present. Given the ASCII: `1 . . . . . A . A T 0`\nThe 'T' is usually the tail of the player snake $S_1$. Since $S_1$ just moved (7, 7) and has length 1, it has no tail yet.\nIf $S_0$ ate an apple last turn, it would be length 2. If $S_0$ was at (9, 1) body [(8, 1)], and ate A(7, 1) or A(5, 1) or A(3, 7) etc., it would grow.\n\nCrucial observation: The board shows Snake 0 (Head) at (8, 1) (marked '0'). The 'T' marker seems to be immediately preceding '0', perhaps indicating the tail of Snake 0? If $H_0=(8, 1)$ and $T_0=(7, 1)$? Wait, $(7, 1)$ is an apple 'A'.\n\nLet's strictly adhere to the provided text data:\n$S_1$: Head (7, 7). Body: none. Apples: 0.\n$S_0$: Head (8, 1). Body: [(8, 1)]. Apples: 1.\n\nIf $S_0$ body is $[(8, 1)]$, it means: $H_0=(8, 1)$, $B_1=(8, 1)$. This is a length 2 snake occupying the same cell twice, which is impossible in a standard pathing game unless the game state log for $S_0$ is simply erroneous regarding the body location relative to the head.\n\n**Assumption derived from visuals/standard rules:** Since $S_0$ has 1 apple, it is length 2. If the head transition occurred from $(9, 1)$ to $(8, 1)$ (LEFT move), the body should have been $[-]$, and the new body should be $[(9, 1)]$. The current state $(8, 1)$ head and body $[(8, 1)]$ implies a collision or death state if interpreted literally.\n\nGiven the game continues, I must assume $S_0$ is safely positioned where it is labeled '0' at (8, 1), and occupies one other cell. Since the ASCII map seems to denote the head of $S_0$ at (8, 1) and perhaps the 'T' marker next to it implies the tail, let's locate where the segments according to standard play would be.\nIf $S_0$ moved LEFT from (9, 1) to (8, 1), its former head (9, 1) should be its new tail segment, and its body segment (8, 1) would have been incorporated as the new second segment if it didn't eat. But it has 1 apple, so it grew. This implies the previous body segment (8, 1) was replaced by the old head (9, 1) and a new segment was added.\n\nLet's assume the board visualization $H_0$ is at (8, 1), and the ASCII '0' marks this. The 'T' marker must be the tail of $S_0$. If $S_0$ moved LEFT, its path suggests its two segments are $(8, 1)$ and $(9, 1)$, with $(8, 1)$ being the head.\n\nWait, the board map key says 'T 0' at the end of the line 1. This usually means Tail (for $S_1$) and Head (for $S_0$).\nIf $H_0=(8, 1)$ and $T_0$ is the cell immediately before it, that would be $(7, 1)$, which is an Apple 'A'. This conflicts entirely.\n\nLet's rely purely on the text log for safety:\n$S_1$: (7, 7), length 1. Can't move backwards to (7, 8). Body is empty otherwise.\n$S_0$: $H_0 = (8, 1)$. Body segment at $B_1 = (8, 1)$. This body log implies the snake just moved onto $(8, 1)$ and *grew*, but the previous segment at $(8, 1)$ was retained, which is impossible.\n\n**Safest interpretation:** $S_0$ occupies (8, 1). Since it has 1 apple, it is length 2. Assume its body segment is located such that it does not occupy any cell that $S_1$ could legally move into this turn, OR that the cell $(8, 1)$ is the only cell it occupies if it died/bugged out, which seems unlikely given the game proceeds. Given the proximity constraint is what matters: $H_0$ is at (8, 1).\n\n**Targeting Apples:**\nCurrent $H_1 = (7, 7)$.\nClosest apple $A_3=(3, 7)$ (Manhattan Distance $4+0=4$).\nNext closest $A_5=(1, 8)$ (MD $6+1=7$).\n\nMy goal remains reaching $A_3=(3, 7)$. Last move was DOWN to (7, 7). Next logical step is LEFT to (6, 7).\n\n**Possible Next Positions ($N_1$ from (7, 7)):**\n*   **UP:** (7, 8). Valid boundary.\n*   **DOWN:** (7, 6). Valid boundary.\n*   **LEFT:** (6, 7). Valid boundary. (Towards A3)\n*   **RIGHT:** (8, 7). Valid boundary.\n\n**Enemy Prediction ($S_0$ at (8, 1)):**\n$S_0$ is very far from $S_1$. $S_1$ at (7, 7) vs $S_0$ at (8, 1). No immediate collision threat unless $S_0$ moves 6 steps UP and 1 step LEFT in one turn, which is impossible. $S_0$ is unlikely to interfere with my path towards $A_3=(3, 7)$ or $A_5=(1, 8)$ for several turns.\n\n**Safety Check:**\nSince $S_1$ has no body, only the move BACKWARDS is risky if the tail segment existed. Since the body list `Body: none` implies length 1, moving UP (backwards to (7, 8)) is safe, unless the previous move (7, 8) became the body, but since I have 0 apples, this is my first move so far, so the previous head position (7, 8) should be safe to move back to. However, $S_1$ is length 1, so moving UP puts $H_1=(7, 8)$ immediately adjacent to the previous location $(7, 8)$ if movement occurred sequentially, but in simultaneous turns, moving UP means the *new* $H_1$ is $(7, 8)$. If $S_1$ had 0 apples, its length is 1. Moving UP means it moves from $C_t$ to $C_{t+1}$, and its tail remains unchanged (since its tail has not yet extended). Moving into the cell vacated by the head in the previous turn is safe unless it immediately became a body segment, which only happens upon eating an apple. Since I have 0 apples, the cell (7, 8) is safe to return to.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\nCurrent $H_1 = (7, 7)$. Target $A_3=(3, 7)$.\n1. UP (7, 8): MD to A3: $|7-3| + |8-7| = 4 + 1 = 5$. (Increased distance compared to 4).\n2. DOWN (7, 6): MD to A3: $|7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5$. (Increased distance compared to 4).\n3. LEFT (6, 7): MD to A3: $|6-3| + |7-7| = 3 + 0 = 3$. (Reduced distance by 1). **BEST**\n4. RIGHT (8, 7): MD to A3: $|8-3| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5$. (Increased distance by 1).\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 7) continues the optimal pursuit of apple $A_3=(3, 7)$. This move keeps me alive and minimizes the distance to the closest food source.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving LEFT while staying on Y=7 until X=3, or until a closer apple (like A5=(1, 8)) becomes more accessible or critical. Since A3 is currently the closest, continue the path towards it.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Priority is eating A3 at (3, 7). Current move sets up the best trajectory towards it by reducing the X distance component optimally.\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

My body is still empty (length 1).\nSnake #0 seems to have moved from (8, 1) to (9, 2) based on the logs (if we assume the confusing previous state resolved to $H_0=(8, 1)$ without growing based on the move prediction of LEFT from (9, 1) which would yield (8, 1) but the current board shows $H_0=(9, 2)$ relative to the previous state $H_0=(8, 1)$).\nIf $H_0$ moved from (8, 1) to (9, 2), this is a RIGHT/UP diagonal move, which is impossible.\n\nLet's re-evaluate $S_0$'s last move based on the *previous* turn's state and the *current* Turn 3 board state.\nPrevious state (Turn 2 end): $H_1=(7, 7)$. $H_0=(8, 1)$, Body $B_0=[(8, 1)]$. (This was highly suspect state for $S_0$).\nCurrent state (Turn 3): $H_1=(6, 7)$. $H_0=(9, 2)$, Body $B_0=[(9, 1)]$.\n\nIf $S_0$ moved from (8, 1) to (9, 2):\nMove must be RIGHT and UP (diagonal). Since diagonal moves are illegal, $S_0$ must have moved either RIGHT (to (9, 1)) or UP (to (8, 2)).\nThe board shows $H_0=(9, 2)$ and $B_0=[(9, 1)]$. This implies $S_0$ grew (length 2), meaning it ate an apple.\nApples available: (7, 1), (3, 7), (0, 2), (1, 8), (5, 1). None of these are (9, 2).\n\nGiven the severe discrepancy in predicting enemy moves based on potentially logged errors, I must trust the current board state and focus on my known safe moves relative to my current position $H_1=(6, 7)$.\n\n$H_1 = (6, 7)$. Target $A_3=(3, 7)$. $d=3$.\nLast move (LEFT) was optimal, moving from $d=4$ to $d=3$.\n\n**Possible Next Positions ($N_1$ from (6, 7)):**\n*   **UP:** (6, 8). MD to A3: $|6-3| + |8-7| = 3 + 1 = 4$. (Distance increases)\n*   **DOWN:** (6, 6). MD to A3: $|6-3| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4$. (Distance increases)\n*   **LEFT:** (5, 7). MD to A3: $|5-3| + |7-7| = 2 + 0 = 2$. (Distance decreases by 1). **BEST**\n*   **RIGHT:** (7, 7). MD to A3: $|7-3| + |7-7| = 4 + 0 = 4$. (Distance increases by 1).\n\n**Safety Check:** My snake is length 1. Moving into the cell (6, 7) vacated last turn is safe.\n\n**Enemy Collision Check:**\n$H_0 = (9, 2)$. I am at (6, 7). No immediate threat.\nIf $S_0$ tries to move towards me:\nIf $S_0$ moves LEFT to (8, 2) or DOWN to (9, 1).\nIf $S_0$ moves UP to (9, 3) or RIGHT to (10, $x$) (off board).\n\nIf $S_0$ moves to (8, 2) (LEFT): (6, 7) is safe.\nIf $S_0$ moves to (9, 1) (DOWN): (6, 7) is safe.\nIf $S_0$ moves to (9, 3) (UP): (6, 7) is safe.\n\nSince I am length 1, any move that advances towards A3 while keeping distance from $S_0$ is good. Moving LEFT keeps me on the optimal path towards $A_3=(3, 7)$.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue towards $A_3=(3, 7)$ by prioritizing LEFT moves followed by necessary UP/DOWN adjustments if $X$ coordinate reaches 3 but $Y$ requires adjustment. Since $H_1$ is not growing, subsequent turns must maintain safety margins around $S_0$ and avoid moving into the cells $(5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)$ if $S_0$ manages to reach that row (Y=7). Given $S_0$ is currently at Y=2, this is not an immediate concern.\nLEFT is the mathematically optimal move to minimize distance to the nearest apple.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nTurn: 4 / 150\n\nApples at: (7, 1), (3, 7), (0, 2), (1, 8), (5, 1)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 0\n  - Snake #0 apples: 1\n\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (5, 7)\n  - Body: none\n  - Apples collected: 0\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #0 - Head: (9, 3), Body: [(9, 2)], Apples: 1\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 .

If $S_0$ moves Right, it must be moving into (10, 3) which is impossible on a 10x10 board (0-9). Assuming standard boundary physics where moving off results in death/no move, $S_0$ likely moves UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n$S_0$ is far away. LEFT is the optimal path continuation towards A3.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue aggressively towards $A_3=(3, 7)$. Prioritize straight lines (LEFT) until $X=3$, then adjust Y.

Old head position $(4, 7)$ becomes the first body segment $B_1$.\n2. $S_0$ moves simultaneously. $H_0$ moves from (9, 4) to somewhere else, likely (9, 5) (UP).\n3. Safety check: Since I am eating an apple, my old head location $(4, 7)$ becomes my new tail segment (if length was $L$, new length is $L+1$, old head becomes $B_1$). Since $L=1$, new length is 2. Tail remains stationary. Since $S_0$ is at $Y \\approx 4$, and I am moving to $Y=7$, no collision with $S_0$ is possible, nor is hitting internal body segments (as I only have one segment previously, which now becomes $B_1$). Collision with $B_1$ won't happen as moving to $(3, 7)$ doesn't involve moving through $(4, 7)$.\n\nThis is the clear optimal move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** After eating $A_3$, $S_1$ is length 2, head at (3, 7), body at (4, 7). New apples are: (7, 1), (0, 2), (1, 8), (5, 1).\nThe next closest apple is $A_5=(5, 1)$ (MD $|3-5| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8$) or $A_2=(0, 2)$ (MD $|3-0| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8$). These are roughly equidistant. I will likely prioritize moving DOWN towards Y=1 or Y=2 region. I must ensure the path down the Y-axis allows my growing tail to move safely.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nTurn: 6 / 150\n\nApples at: (7, 1), (3, 7), (0, 2), (1, 8), (5, 1)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 1\n  - Snake #0 apples: 1\n\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (3, 7)\n  - Body: [(4, 7)]\n  - Apples collected: 1\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #0 - Head: (9, 5), Body: [(9, 4)], Apples: 1\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 .

Tail $(4, 7)$ is gone.\n\nCurrent state used for evaluation: $H_1=(3, 6), B_1=[(3, 7)]$. Target $A_5=(5, 1)$. MD=8.\n\n**Possible Next Positions ($N_1$ from (3, 6)):**\n*   **UP:** (3, 7). This cell is $B_1$. Moving UP results in self-collision and DEATH! **(ILLEGAL)**\n*   **DOWN:** (3, 5). MD to A5: $|3-5| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6$. **BEST**\n*   **LEFT:** (2, 6). MD to A5: $|2-5| + |6-1| = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n*   **RIGHT:** (4, 6). MD to A5: $|4-5| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6$. (This is also optimal distance-wise).\n\nWe have two choices reducing MD to 6: DOWN (3, 5) or RIGHT (4, 6).\n\n1. Move DOWN to (3, 5): New state $H'=(3, 5), B'=[(3, 6)]$. Safe, moves towards Y=1.\n2. Move RIGHT to (4, 6): New state $H'=(4, 6), B'=[(3, 6)]$. Safe, moves towards X=5.\n\nSince the target is $A_5=(5, 1)$, moving RIGHT gets us 1 step closer on X, while DOWN gets us 1 step closer on Y (if we consider the displacement needed).\nIf we go DOWN (3, 5), next target (5, 1). MD=6.\nIf we go RIGHT (4, 6), next target (5, 1). MD=6.\n\nIf we move RIGHT: We are moving one step away from (3, 7) (which is $B_1$). This seems slightly less committing than moving deeper down the column we just entered. Going RIGHT seems to keep options slightly more flexible on the X-axis for crossing paths later, although both moves are equally good based on Manhattan distance to $A_5$.\n\nLet's review $A_2=(0, 2)$ (MD=8 initially).\nIf RIGHT to (4, 6): MD to A2: $|4-0| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8$.\nIf DOWN to (3, 5): MD to A2: $|3-0| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6$. **DOWN is better towards A2**.\n\nSince $A_2$ and $A_5$ are equally far initially (MD=8), and DOWN reduces the distance to $A_2$ more effectively (MD=6 vs MD=8 for RIGHT), let's prioritize DOWN, as it commits to the lowest Y coordinate region which contains $A_5$ and $A_2$.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Commit to moving DOWN towards the bottom apples ($A_5$ at (5, 1) or $A_2$ at (0, 2)). We must move away from the segment $(3, 7)$ above us. DOWN is the best step towards the bottom cluster.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nTurn: 8 / 150\n\nApples at: (7, 1), (3, 7), (0, 2), (1, 8), (5, 1)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 1\n  - Snake #0 apples: 1\n\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (3, 5)\n  - Body: [(3, 6)]\n  - Apples collected: 1\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #0 - Head: (9, 7), Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5)], Apples: 1\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 .

Length 2. The segment $(4, 7)$ dropped off correctly based on length conservation.\nSnake #0 moved from (9, 5) to (9, 7) (diagonal jump?) or maybe it ate A(9, 7) which is not listed, or it moved up twice if the game allows multiple moves, which it shouldn't, or the board representation is skewed again for $S_0$. $H_0=(9, 7), B_0=[(9, 6), (9, 5)]$. This implies $S_0$ grew by 1 segment *and* moved $2$ steps up, which is impossible in one turn unless it ate two apples simultaneously, or it ate an apple at (9, 7) and grew while moving UP. Since there is no apple at (9, 7), $S_0$ must have moved to (9, 6) or (9, 7) if it ate something. Given the previous state $H_0=(9, 5), B_0=[(9, 4)]$.

Which apple? None of the remaining apples are at (4, 4).\n\n**CRITICAL DEDUCTION:** The provided game state summaries appear inconsistent with standard movement rules *unless* the board illustration provided shows the state *after* the move, and implies A(5, 1) jumped to (4, 4) coordinate due to an internal state shift, OR the provided board state is simply wrong about the score or apple locations relative to the move chosen.\n\nGiven the established pattern of successful movements towards A3 up to T6, and the current Board State showing Score 2, H1=(4, 4), B1=[(3, 4)], I MUST proceed from this state, assuming I ate an apple that transitioned my head to (4, 4). Since $(5, 1)$ is the next visually closest apple that isn't near $S_0$, I will assume that *somehow* moving RIGHT got me to (4, 4) and caused growth, implying the apple was at (4, 4) or (3, 4) or (5, 4) or (4, 5) or (4, 3).

New state $H'=(4, 3), B'=[(4, 4)]$.\n\nSince $A_{7, 1}$ requires 3 steps right and 3 steps down, moving RIGHT advances X by 1 while maintaining Y=4 (1 step penalty on Y movement remaining), moving DOWN advances Y by 1 while maintaining X=4 (1 step penalty on X movement remaining). These are symmetric in terms of distance improvement.\n\nLet's choose RIGHT to approach X=7 faster, as $S_0$ seems committed to the top edge $Y=9$.\n\n**Safety Check:** Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) is safe. $H_0=(9, 9)$.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Head towards $A_{7, 1}=(7, 1)$.

Length 2.\nCRITICAL ERROR: I did not eat the apple at (7, 1). Score remains 2, but the board state indicates score 3. This implies that moving to (7, 4) constituted eating an apple. Which apple? A(7, 1) is still listed, yet the score jumped. For consistency with the provided log, I must assume I ate an apple that was NOT (7, 1), and the score bump is correct. Given the board state shows the apple (7, 1) symbol 'A' is still present, this suggests the score bump is erroneous *or* one of the previous apples was secretly located differently and consumed.\n\nSince the score tracker is usually reliable for growth: Score 2 -> 3. Length L=2 -> L=3.\nIf L=3, $B_1$ should be $[(6, 4), (5, 4)]$. (Since $(5, 4)$ was $B_1$ before last move).\n\n**Revisiting Growth Rule for L=2, No food:** $H, B_1$. Move to $H'$. New state $H', B'_1=H$. $B_1$ drops off.\nT11 State: $H=(5, 4), B=[(4, 4)]$. L=2. (Tail (5, 4) dropped).\nT12 Move RIGHT to (6, 4). No food. New state $H'=(6, 4), B'=[(5, 4)]$. (Tail (4, 4) dropped). L=2 confirmed.\nT13 Move RIGHT to (7, 4). If score went 2->3, an apple WAS eaten at (7, 4) or one of the positions moved through. Nothing listed at (7, 4).\n\n**Assuming Score 3 is correct, L=3:** $H_1=(7, 4)$. $B_1=[(6, 4), (5, 4)]$.\n$S_0$ moved LEFT one step to (8, 8). $H_0=(8, 8), B_0=[(9, 9), (9, 8)]$. (Wait, $S_0$ lost a segment (9, 7) if it moved without eating, but it grew in T10). If $S_0$ is L=3, it must have eaten recently too.\n\nGiven the absolute mess in tracking $S_0$ and the apparent inconsistency in $S_1$'s apple count/location correlation: I must trust my current location $H_1=(7, 4)$ and aim for the *listed* remaining apples, assuming $L=3$ now.\n\nRemaining Apples: $A_{7, 1}=(7, 1), A_{0, 2}=(0, 2), A_{1, 8}=(1, 8)$.\n$H_1 = (7, 4)$. Target $A_{7, 1}=(7, 1)$. MD $= 0 + 3 = 3$. **This is the target, distance 3.**\n\n**Possible Next Positions ($N_1$ from (7, 4)):**\n*   **UP:** (7, 5). MD to A(7,1): 0 + 4 = 4.\n*   **DOWN:** (7, 3). MD to A(7,1): 0 + 2 = 2. **BEST**\n*   **LEFT:** (6, 4). Obstructed by $B_1$. **(ILLEGAL)**\n*   **RIGHT:** (8, 4). MD to A(7,1): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7, 3) is optimal, reducing distance dramatically.\n\n**Safety Check:** Moving DOWN to (7, 3) is safe. $H_0$ is at (8, 8). $S_0$ is moving away from the bottom. The body segments $B_1=[(6, 4), (5, 4)]$ are safely above $Y=4$.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Execute the final vertical descent towards $(7, 1)$ to secure the next apple. We must be careful if we hit Y=1, as we might need to maneuver around the fixed body trail above us ($Y=4$). Moving DOWN seems best for reaching the target coordinate first.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nTurn: 14 / 150\n\nApples at: (7, 1), (3, 7), (0, 2), (1, 8), (5, 1)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 4\n  - Snake #0 apples: 1\n\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (7, 3)\n  - Body: [(7, 4), (6, 4)]\n  - Apples collected: 4\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #0 - Head: (7, 8), Body: [(8, 8), (9, 9)], Apples: 1\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . 0\n 8 .

Score jumped from 2 to 4, implying 2 apples eaten? This contradicts moving to (7, 4) and only having 1 apple available in that range. Assuming the state update means a single successful consumption of $A_{7, 1}$ occurred, and thus score went 2->3, and the board visualization reflecting $L=3$ is correct, but the reported score 4 is anomalous. I will assume score 3 is intended based on the single target, and L=3. If score 4 is true, L=4 required. Given the body log shows $B=[(7, 4), (6, 4)]$, this is L=3. Score 4 is likely an error, I proceed with L=3.\n$S_0$ moved from (8, 8) to (7, 8) (LEFT). $H_0=(7, 8)$. $S_0$ is now dangerously close horizontally, but far vertically.\n\n$H_1 = (7, 3)$. Target $A_{7, 1}=(7, 1)$.\nSince the apple $(7, 1)$ is still listed, the move to (7, 4) did NOT eat it, despite my target selection pathway. If the score jumped to 4, it is utterly baffling.\n\nLet's proceed by assuming the visible apple $A(7, 1)$ is the target. MD=2.\n\n**Possible Next Positions ($N_1$ from (7, 3)):**\n*   **UP:** (7, 4). Obstructed by $B_1$. **(ILLEGAL)**\n*   **DOWN:** (7, 2). MD to A(7,1): 0 + 1 = 1. **BEST**\n*   **LEFT:** (6, 3).

We have a safe corridor down Y=7 column and $S_0$ is at Y=8.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move DOWN to (7, 2). Next move will secure (7, 1) and result in growth ($L=4$, assuming current $L=3$).

No, $H_0$ is $X=0, Y=5$. $B_0$ starts at $X=1, Y=6$. $H_0$ can move RIGHT to (1, 5) safely relative to its current body segments.\n\nIf $S_0$ predicts we go UP to (1, 5), $S_0$ might go RIGHT to (1, 5) resulting in mutual death.\nIf $H_0$ moves UP to $(0, 6)$, we safely move to $(1, 5)$.\n\nSince $S_0$ is far from eating an apple (it has 1, so L=2), it is unlikely to prioritize growing over defense or movement. Given the aggressive leftward push, $S_0$ might prefer LEFT (off board) or UP/DOWN. UP to $(0, 6)$ is plausible.\n\nIf we choose UP $(1, 5)$, we rely on $S_0$ NOT choosing RIGHT $(1, 5)$.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Move LEFT to (0, 5) to threaten collision with $H_0$ if $H_0$ moves UP?**\nMove LEFT to $(0, 5)$. If $H_0$ moves RIGHT to $(1, 5)$, we move to $(0, 5)$, leading to collision. If $H_0$ moves UP to $(0, 6)$, we move to $(0, 5)$, $D=1$. Safe.\n\nGiven the proximity on the X=0, X=1 line, going UP seems the most direct path to the apple $A_{1, 8}$. I will risk collision relying on $S_0$ not choosing the exact collision coordinate unless it's forced. $S_0$ will likely move UP or DOWN to keep hunting resources/avoid my body.\n\nUP (Assuming $S_0$ avoids mutual collision spot (1, 5)).\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--",

Safe separation. (1, 6) is blocked by $B_0$'s current position. $B_0=[(1, 6)]$. **(1, 6) is blocked by $B_0$ head from last turn before it moved.** WAIT! $H_0$ moved from $(0, 5)$ to $(0, 6)$. Its body shifts. $B_0$ before the move was $[(1, 6), (2, 6)]$. After the move: $B_0$ is $[(0, 6), (1, 6)]$.\n    *   If we move UP to (1, 6): We collide with $B_0$'s new tail segment $(1, 6)$. **Illegal.**\n\n2.  **Collision with $B_1$:** (1, 4) is $B_1$.\n    *   Move UP to (1, 6) is safe from $B_1$'s current position.\n\n3.  **Collision with $H_0$ next move:**\n    *   If we move LEFT to (0, 5): $H_0$ moves to (0, 7). Safe. $D(H_1(0, 5), H_0(0, 7))=2$. This is a legal move that brings us closer to $H_0$ but maintains distance from $A_{1, 8}$ (MD=1+3=4).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n    *   UP (1, 6): ILLEGAL (hits $B_0$).\n    *   DOWN (1, 4): ILLEGAL (hits $B_1$).\n    *   LEFT (0, 5): Legal, MD=4.\n    *   RIGHT (2, 5): Legal, MD=4.\n\nWe can choose LEFT (0, 5) or RIGHT (2, 5), both yielding MD=4. Both put us 1 step away from X=1 alignment. Left is slightly more aligned with $H_0$'s movement pattern, but $A_{1, 8}$ is at $X=1$. Moving RIGHT seems slightly better to align to X=1 faster, while simultaneously putting distance between us and $H_0$ (now at (0, 7)).\n\nIf we move RIGHT (2, 5): $D(H_1(2, 5), H_0(0, 7)) = 2 + 2 = 4$. Safe. We gain 1 unit of X progress towards the center/right side where other apples are, although the immediate target is X=1.\n\nI choose RIGHT to maintain maximum distance from the increasingly aggressive snake $S_0$ on the left boundary, even if it means moving AWAY from X=1 temporarily.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move towards the cluster of apples on the right side if $A_{1, 8}$ requires confrontation with $S_0$ along $X=0$. Since $A_{1, 8}$ is reachable safely in 3 UP moves if we were not blocked, we take RIGHT to (2, 5) and then attempt 2 UP (to secure Y=7), then 1 LEFT (to secure X=1) or 1 UP/1 RIGHT depending on $S_0$'s position.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nTurn: 27 / 150\n\nApples at: (7, 1), (3, 7), (0, 2), (1, 8), (5, 1)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 11\n  - Snake #0 apples: 1\n\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (2, 5)\n  - Body: [(1, 5), (1, 4)]\n  - Apples collected: 11\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #0 - Head: (0, 7), Body: [(0, 6), (1, 6)], Apples: 1\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . 0\n 8 .
