Not the hype we want.  \n- \ud83d\udc48 **LEFT** is safe, but it pushes us farther from the juicy apple at (7,9) and gives the opponent space to wiggle leftwards.  \n- \ud83d\udc47 **DOWN** is also safe, yet it drifts us toward the bottom where the apple field is a bit sparser.  \n\n\u2705 **UP** to (7,8) keeps us alive, lines us up perfectly for the apple at (7,9) on the next turn, and forces the opponent to decide between hugging the wall or heading into open space. Plus we stay clear of any immediate head\u2011on danger.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Move **UP** now to (7,8).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn, if the opponent is still hanging out on the right, sprint **UP** again to snag the apple at (7,9).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Once we\u2019re longer, start hemming the rival against the right edge and look for a head\u2011on showdown when we\u2019ve got the apple lead.  \n\nLet\u2019s roll!  \n\nUP",

Current state after last move? The description says our last move was RIGHT, moving from (5,0) to (6,0). So now our head is at (6,0). Need to update body: our previous body was Head (5,0) then (5,0?) Wait original at turn 15: Head at (5,0) (they moved from (4,0) to (5,0) right). After that they moved RIGHT to (6,0). Since they didn\\'t eat apple? Let\\'s check board: Apple positions at turn 16 list, includes (9,0) but not (6,0). So no apple. So snake moves, tail removes last segment. Original body list at turn 15: Head (5,0); Body: [(4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)] (that\\'s 8 segments total). After moving RIGHT without eating, new head (6,0), new body shift: new segments = (6,0) head, then previous head (5,0) becomes first body segment, then rest shift, dropping tail (4,6). So new body list: [(5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]. Length remains 8. So positions occupied: (6,0) head, (5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Good.\\n\\nOpponent snake #0: previous head (6,2) after they moved? Actually turn 15 opponent head at (6,2) after eating apple? Wait they had head (6,2) after moving right from (5,2) to (6,2) and ate an apple at (6,2). That gave them +1 apple (now 6? Actually they had 5 apples before, they\\'d get 6). They also grow by 1 segment, meaning they do not remove tail this turn. Their previous body list before move: Head (5,2); Body: [(5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2)]. Length 5? Actually includes head: total 5 segments. After moving RIGHT to (6,2) and eating apple, new head (6,2); body becomes [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2)] and no tail removal, length becomes 6. So their occupied cells now: (6,2) head, (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2). Good.\\n\\nNow turn 16 we need to decide our move. Simaneous move with opponent. We must consider opponent\\'s possible moves from their current head (6,2). Their body occupies (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2). Let\\'s analyze open cells around (6,2):\\n\\n- Up: (6,3) - is that occupied? Board shows apple at (,3)? Actually there is apple at (6,3)? Look at board representation: Row 3 (y=3) line: \"3 A A . . T . . . . .\" \u2013 coordinates: x0 A, x1 A (apples), x2 . , x3 . , x4 T (our snake body at (4,3)),'}])]. Generated random move RIGHT to continue the game.",
