          "rationale": "**Rationale for Current Turn:**\nAt turn 0, I am at (2,6) with no body, and the enemy snake is at (8,8). The board is mostly open. I see apples at (3,6) to my right, (2,2) below, (0,1) far left, and many others. I should move towards an apple that is safe and keeps options open. The immediate right to (3,6) is an apple, but I need to check if moving right is safe. (3,6) is currently empty (based on board: row 6 shows \". . 1 A . A . . . .\", so index 3 is 'A', index 2 is '1' (my head), index 4 is '.'? Wait, coordinates: row 6 (y=6) columns 0-9: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '1' (my head at 2,6), col3 'A' (apple at 3,6), col4 '.', col5 'A', etc. So right to (3,6) is an apple. That seems safe and gives immediate growth. However, I must consider the enemy snake at (8,8). The enemy likely will move to get apples too. But I don't know enemy's move. I should avoid moving into potential head-on collision. Since enemy is far away (8,8), moving right to (3,6) is safe for now. Also, moving right keeps me in the open area. Other options: down to (2,5) is empty (row 5 col2 is '.'), left to (1,6) is empty (row 6 col1 is '.'), up to (2,7) is empty (row 7 col2 is '.'). All directions seem safe except maybe later. I should choose the move that increases my apple count and opens paths to more apples. Right to (3,6) gives an apple immediately, so I'll take that. It also puts me closer to other apples like (5,6) and (4,2) etc. Moving right also avoids moving towards the enemy at (8,8) which is far right top. I think right is best.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**\nAfter eating apple at (3,6), my head will be at (3,6) and body will be at (2,6). Then I need to plan to collect more apples safely. The board has many apples in clusters: (4,1), (5,1), (0,1), (0,5), (7,5), (7,8), (8,0), (9,7), (3,8), (4,2), (2,2), (5,6), (3,1), (2,0), (7,8). I should aim for a cluster that is not contested by the enemy. The enemy is at (8,8) so they might go for apples near them like (9,7), (7,8), (8,0). I should avoid those and focus on left/center apples: (0,1), (0,5), (2,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,6), (3,8). I'll need to watch the enemy's movements and avoid collisions. Since the board is open, I can plan a path. Possibly after (3,6), go up to (3,7) then to (3,8) for apple, or go down to (3,5) then to (2,5) etc. But I'll decide later.\n\n**Current Move Decision:**\nI will move RIGHT to (3,6) to eat the apple and grow.\n\nRIGHT",

My body now consists of my previous head at (2,6) and the old tail cell at (3,6) is actually the apple I just ate, which grows my snake by 1, so my body list is now [(2,6)] and will become [(2,6), (2,6)? Wait, careful: At turn 1, after moving right from (2,6) to (3,6), I ate an apple. The snake's body updates: the new head is (3,6), and the old head (2,6) becomes the first segment of the body. Since I grew by 1, the tail remains at (2,6) for now? Actually, normally, if you eat, you grow by 1, so the tail does not move this turn. So my body list becomes [(2,6)] (the old head) and the tail stays at (2,6). However, the board representation for next turn should show the head at (3,6) and body including (2,6). The enemy snake #0 is at (7,8) with body [(8,8)].\n\nNow I need to decide my move for turn 2 (from (3,6)). Let's evaluate directions:\n\n- **UP to (3,7)**: Check board row 7 (y=7). The board shows row 7: \"... . . . . . . . . A\"? Wait, let's parse the given board state from the prompt (it's the current state, not updated). The board state provided is from the beginning of turn 1? The prompt says \"Turn: 1 / 150\" and then the board state. That board state shows my head at (3,6) as '1'? Actually, the board row 6: \". . T 1 A . A . . .\". So at (3,6) there is '1' (my head) and (4,6) is 'A'. But after my move right, (3,6) becomes my new head, and (2,6) becomes body. The board given might not reflect that yet? The prompt says \"Board state:\" and then shows the grid. That grid seems to be the state at the start of turn 1? Let's see: It shows at (3,6) an 'A'? Actually, row 6: col3 is 'A' (apple). But my head is at (2,6) as '1'? The row 6 string is: \". . T 1 A . A . . .\". This is confusing because there is 'T' at col2? The string has: index0 '.', index1 '.', index2 'T', index3 '1', index4 'A', index5 '.', index6 'A', ... So (2,6) is 'T' (tail) and (3,6) is '1' (head). That suggests at turn 1 start, my head is at (3,6) and body at (2,6). But the user message says \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (3,6), Body: [(2,6)]\". So the board matches: head at (3,6), body at (2,6). So the board state is after my move? Actually, the user says \"Turn: 1 / 150\" and then gives the board state. But in the last move rationale, I moved RIGHT to (3,6). So now turn 1 is over? The prompt says \"Turn: 1 / 150\" and then the board state. So it's the start of turn 1? Wait, the user says \"Your last move information\" which is from turn 0? Actually, the prompt says \"Turn: 1 / 150\" and then shows the board state. The last move was from turn 0 to turn 1. So the board state shown is after the move? Possibly yes, because my head is at (3,6) and body at (2,6). So the board is current state.\n\nSo at turn 1, I am at (3,6) with body [(2,6)]. Now I need to move for turn 1? Actually, the user says \"Turn: 1 / 150\" and asks for my move? I need to output a move for turn 1? The user says \"You are controlling a snake... Turn: 1 / 150\". And then the last move info is provided. So I think I am to make a move for turn 1 (i.e., from (3,6)). The last move was RIGHT from (2,6) to (3,6). So now I need to decide next move from (3,6).\n\nLet's evaluate safety and options from (3,6).\n\nFirst, check immediate dangers:\n- My own body: (2,6) is adjacent (left). Moving LEFT would put my head into my own body, which is fatal. So LEFT is not safe.\n- Other directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nCheck board boundaries: (3,6) is within 0-9.\n\nCheck enemy snake #0: head at (7,8), body at (8,8). Not adjacent to (3,6).\n\nNow check each direction for apples and future path.\n\nCoordinates from (3,6):\n- UP (3,7): Check board row 7. The board row 7 is: \". . . . . . . . . A\" (based on the grid: row 7 string: \". . . . . . . . . A\"? Let's read the board exactly:\n\nRow 9: \"9 . . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 8: \"8 . . . A . . . 0 T .\"\nRow 7: \"7 . . . . . . . . .

(empty). Not an apple. Safe.\n- DOWN (3,5): row5 col3 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- LEFT (3,5) is actually left to (2,6)? Wait, left from (3,6) is (2,6) which is my body (the tail). So LEFT is fatal.\n- RIGHT (4,6): row6 col4 is 'A' (apple). So moving right to (4,6) would eat an apple.\n\nSo immediate options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow consider strategy: I already have 1 apple (from previous turn). I want to collect more safely. The board has many apples. I should aim for a path that avoids dead ends and avoids the enemy.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (7,8) with body at (8,8). Enemy likely will move to get apples nearby: (9,7) apple, (3,8) apple, (8,0) apple, (7,8) apple? Actually, (7,8) is enemy head itself, but there is an apple at (3,8) and (9,7) and (8,0) and (7,5) etc. The enemy might go for (9,7) or (3,8). I should avoid moving towards the enemy's likely paths.\n\nMy current position (3,6) is relatively central. I have apples nearby: (4,6) right, (5,6) two steps right, (3,8) up two steps, (2,2) down-left, (0,5) left-up, (0,1) far left, etc.\n\nI need to consider long-term survival. Moving right to (4,6) eats an apple and grows, but then my body will be at (3,6) and (2,6). That could lead to a tight space if I go further right, but there are many open cells.\n\nIf I move up to (3,7), I can go to (3,8) which has an apple. That might be a good plan. But check: (3,8) is an apple, and (3,7) is empty. However, (3,8) is near the enemy? Enemy at (7,8) is far. (3,8) is safe for now.\n\nIf I move down to (3,5), I can go towards apples at (2,2) or (0,1) etc.\n\nBut I need to consider that moving right to (4,6) eats an apple immediately, which is good for score and growth. However, after eating, my body will be longer, which might restrict future moves. But since I'm still short, it's fine.\n\nNow, what about the enemy's potential moves? The enemy could move left, right, up, down from (7,8). The enemy body is at (8,8). So moving left to (6,8) is possible, right to (8,8) is its own body (tail), so likely not. Up to (7,9) is within board (empty), down to (7,7) is empty. The enemy might go for apples: (9,7) is right and down? From (7,8), to reach (9,7), it might move right to (8,8) but that's its tail? Actually, (8,8) is its tail, so moving right into its own tail is fatal because it's a body segment? The rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So moving right into (8,8) (its own tail) would kill it. So enemy cannot move right. It could move up to (7,9) which is empty, down to (7,7) empty, left to (6,8) empty. The nearest apple is (9,7) which is two moves away: right then down? But from (7,8), moving right is fatal, so it cannot go directly right. It might go down to (7,7) then right to (8,7) then right to (9,7). Or go left then down then right? So enemy may not immediately threaten me.\n\nThus, for now, all three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe. I should choose the one that gives the best long-term advantage.\n\nLet's analyze each:\n\n1. **RIGHT to (4,6)**: Eat apple, grow. After this, my head at (4,6), body at [(3,6), (2,6)]. From there, options: left back to (3,6) is body (fatal), up (4,7) is empty, down (4,5) is empty, right (5,6) is empty? Actually (5,6) is '.' (row6 col5). So I could go right further to (5,6) which is empty, then maybe to (5,5) etc. But (5,6) is empty, not an apple. There is an apple at (5,6)? The board row6 col5 is '.' (index5: after col4 'A', col5 '.'), so no apple. There is an apple at (5,3) and (5,1). So moving right might lead me away from clusters. However, (4,6) is adjacent to (4,5) and (4,7), both open. I could go up to (4,7) then to (4,8) which is '.'? Actually (4,8) is '.' (row8 col4). Then (3,8) is an apple. So path: (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8) -> (3,8) eat apple. That's a good path. Also, (4,6) -> down to (4,5) -> left to (3,5) -> down to (3,4) etc. So still flexible.\n\n2. **UP to (3,7)**: Move to empty cell. After this, head at (3,7), body at [(3,6), (2,6)] (since I didn't eat, the tail moves? Actually, if I don't eat, the tail moves forward: the body list becomes [(3,6), (2,6)] and the old tail (2,6) moves off, so the new tail becomes (3,6)? Wait, careful: When you move without eating, you advance the whole body: the new head is (3,7), old head (3,6) becomes first body segment, old tail (2,6) is discarded? Actually, the body list is ordered head-to-tail. At start of turn, body = [(2,6)] (just one segment). After moving UP to (3,7) without eating, the new body becomes [(3,6)] (since the old head becomes the first body segment, and the old tail (2,6) is gone because the snake didn't grow). So my body would be [(3,6)]. That's correct. So from (3,7), my body is at (3,6). Now, moving from (3,7), I can go further up to (3,8) which is an apple. That would be good: eat apple and grow. Also, from (3,7), I can go right to (4,7) empty, left to (2,7) empty, down back to (3,6) which is my body (fatal). So UP seems to open a path to (3,8) apple directly.\n\n3. **DOWN to (3,5)**: Move to empty cell. Head at (3,5), body becomes [(3,6)] (old head). From there, I can go down further to (3,4) empty, left to (2,5) empty, right to (4,5) empty, up back to (3,6) body. There are apples nearby: (2,2), (0,1), (0,5). Might be a bit farther.\n\nComparing: RIGHT gives immediate apple but leads to a position where left is blocked by own body, and I might be moving towards the right side where enemy is? Enemy is at (7,8), so I'm still far. UP gives a clear path to (3,8) apple in one more move, and (3,8) is at the top edge, which might be a dead end? Actually, from (3,8), you can go left to (2,8) which is empty? (2,8) is '.' (row8 col2). Right to (4,8) empty, up to (3,9) empty, down back to (3,7). So not a dead end.\n\nDOWN goes towards the center lower area with many apples.\n\nI need to consider that the enemy might move towards (3,8) if they go left. (7,8) -> left to (6,8) -> left to (5,8) -> left to (4,8) -> left to (3,8). That's 4 moves, so not immediate.\n\nGiven that I have no immediate threats, I should aim for the apple that is closest and safe. (3,8) is two moves away if I go UP now, and (4,6) is one move away if I go RIGHT now. Both are safe. However, (3,8) is an apple that might be contested later? Possibly, but for now, it's free.\n\nAlso, consider the number of turns: 150 turns total, we are at turn 1 (of 150). So there is plenty of time. I should prioritize building a longer snake and securing apples without getting trapped.\n\nLooking at the board, there is a cluster of apples around (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (0,1), (2,2), (4,2), (5,3), (5,6), (3,8), (7,5), (9,7), (8,0), (2,0). Many apples in lower left and center.\n\nI am at (3,6). Moving UP to (3,7) gives me access to (3,8) apple, and also to the upper right area. Moving RIGHT to (4,6) gives immediate apple but then I might be more exposed on the right side.\n\nI should also consider that moving RIGHT might lead me into a path where the enemy could intercept? The enemy is far, so not likely.\n\nBut let's think about the board layout: There is an apple at (4,6) directly to my right. If I don't take it, it might remain available for later. But taking it now gives me a growth and removes that apple from the board.\n\nI think both UP and RIGHT are good. However, LEFT is fatal, DOWN is safe but doesn't give an apple immediately.\n\nI want to maximize apples and keep options open. Moving UP to (3,7) doesn't give an apple now, but sets up for (3,8) next turn. Moving RIGHT to (4,6) gives an apple now, but then I have to decide where to go next. From (4,6), I could go UP to (4,7) then to (3,8) for another apple, or go to other apples.\n\nGiven the immediate reward, I might choose RIGHT to get the apple now, especially since it's adjacent and safe.\n\nBut wait: after moving RIGHT to (4,6), my head will be at (4,6) and my body will be [(3,6), (2,6)]. From there, moving UP to (4,7) is safe (empty). From (4,7), moving LEFT to (3,7) is safe? (3,7) is empty, but then from (3,7) I can go UP to (3,8) apple. So I can still get (3,8) in two moves after RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP now, I can get (3,8) in one move after (3,7). So both paths yield similar apple acquisition.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's potential move this turn. The enemy might move towards apples like (9,7) or (3,8). If the enemy moves towards (3,8), I might want to secure it first. From (3,6), moving UP puts me on a direct path to (3,8). If I move RIGHT, I'm moving away from (3,8). So UP might be better to compete for that apple.\n\nBut (3,8) is not immediately threatened. The enemy is at (7,8) and would need several moves to reach (3,8). So I have time.\n\nAnother factor: The board has many apples, but some are isolated. I should aim to collect apples in a way that doesn't trap me. For example, if I go to (3,8) (the top row), I can still move along the top row (y=8) to other apples? There is an apple at (3,8) and also at (7,8) is enemy head, not apple. There is an apple at (8,0) and (9,7). So top row has only (3,8) and (7,8) is enemy. So after (3,8), I might need to go back down.\n\nGiven all this, I think moving RIGHT to eat the immediate apple is a solid choice. It grows my snake and gives me a point, and I still have flexibility.\n\nNow, check safety: moving RIGHT to (4,6) is empty (apple). No collision with enemy or my body. So safe.\n\nThus, I will move RIGHT.\n\n**Current Move Decision:**\nI will move RIGHT to (4,6) to eat the apple and grow.\n\nRIGHT\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nNote: I must ensure the final line is exactly \"RIGHT\".RIGHT",

(6,6) is adjacent right.\n\n**Safety Check (Collisions & Walls):**\n- **UP (5,7):** Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN (5,5):** Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT (4,6):** This is my current body segment (2nd segment). Moving here would result in self-collision. **Unsafe.**\n- **RIGHT (6,6):** Contains an apple (per board state). Safe.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1.  **Immediate Safety & Growth:**\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (6,6) is safe and eats an apple (+1 score). The body becomes [(5,6), (4,6)]. The tail moves from (3,6) to (4,6) (growth).\n    *   Moving **DOWN** is also safe but doesn't grant an apple immediately. It places me closer to the cluster at (5,3), (4,1), (5,1).\n    *   Moving **UP** is safe but moves me towards the enemy at (5,8). While I am currently larger (3 segments vs enemy's 2), risking a head-on collision this early is unnecessary if there is a safer apple.\n\n2.  **Enemy Interaction:**\n    *   The enemy is at (5,8). If I move UP to (5,7), I put myself directly in front of them. If they move DOWN, we collide (head-on), resulting in mutual death. Since I have more apples (2 vs 1), dying is a bad trade unless forced.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (6,6), the enemy is at (5,8). They are unlikely to reach me immediately, and I gain a point.\n\n3.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   My immediate goal is to secure the apple at (6,6) safely.\n    *   After eating, my head will be at (6,6), body [(5,6), (4,6)].\n    *   From (6,6), I will look to navigate towards the dense apple clusters in the lower half of the board (e.g., (5,3), (4,2), (5,1)) while keeping an eye on the enemy's position. I must avoid being boxed in by the enemy or my own tail.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (6,6) is the optimal move. It is safe, gains a point, and avoids unnecessary confrontation with the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "**Analyzing Current State (Turn 4):**\n\n**1. Enemy Position & Intent:**\n- **Snake #0** is at (4,8) with body [(5,8)].\n- They are positioned directly North-East of my previous position (5,6). However, I moved **RIGHT** last turn, so my current position is (6,6).\n- **Distance:** The Euclidean distance between Snake #0's head (4,8) and my head (6,6) is roughly $\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.82$.\n- **Threat Analysis:** If Snake #0 moves **DOWN** to (4,7) or **LEFT** to (3,8), they are not threatening me immediately. If they move **RIGHT** to (5,8), they collide with their own tail (5,8) and die (unless they ate an apple last turn, but apples are still at 1, so no growth). If they move **UP** to (4,9), they are safe but moving away. The most likely \"attack\" path is **DOWN** or **LEFT**, placing them at (4,7) or (3,8).\n- **Head-on Collision Risk:** My head is at (6,6). To collide head-on with Snake #0, I would need to move to (4,8) or (5,8) (impossible this turn) or they would need to move to (6,6). From (4,8), the only path to (6,6) in one turn is if they move **RIGHT** (suicide) or if my coordinates were different. The current distance is 2 moves for them. **No immediate head-on collision risk.**\n\n**2. My Position & Safety:**\n- **Head:** (6,6)\n- **Body:** [(5,6), (4,6)]\n- **Tail:** (4,6) (The segment at (3,6) from the previous turn disappears because I grew when eating the apple at (6,6)).\n- **Available Moves:**\n    - **UP (6,7):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **DOWN (6,5):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **LEFT (5,6):** Currently occupied by my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). **UNSAFE** (Self-collision).\n    - **RIGHT (7,6):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**3. Apple Availability & Strategy:**\n- **Apples at (7,5) and (5,1) and (5,3)** are the closest targets.\n- **Option A (UP):** Moves to (6,7). From here, I can access (7,6) or (6,8). (6,8) is close to the enemy (5,8), but currently empty. (6,7) is not an apple. It moves me toward the top of the board, which is more crowded with the enemy.\n- **Option B (DOWN):** Moves to (6,5). From here, I am 2 tiles away from the apple at (7,5) (via RIGHT-UP or UP-RIGHT) and 4 tiles away from (5,3). This direction moves me toward the \"safer\" lower half of the board and the apple cluster.\n- **Option C (RIGHT):** Moves to (7,6). This is 1 tile away from the apple at (7,5) (via DOWN next turn). This is a very direct route to the closest apple (7,5).\n\n**4. Comparative Analysis:**\n- **Left:** Impossible (Self-collision).\n- **Up:** Moves me closer to the enemy (4,8). While not immediately lethal, it reduces the gap between us. The enemy is likely to move down or left. Being at (6,7) puts me in a position where if the enemy moves to (4,7) or (3,8), we are still separated, but I am narrowing the playing field unnecessarily.\n- **Down & Right:** Both move me toward apples. (7,6) (Right) puts me directly adjacent to the apple at (7,5). (6,5) (Down) is close to multiple apples.\n- **Priority:** Securing the apple at (7,5) is a high priority because it is the closest edible apple (2 turns away via DOWN, 2 turns away via RIGHT+DOWN, 3 turns via UP+RIGHT+DOWN).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (7,6) is the strongest move. It positions me perfectly to eat the apple at (7,5) next turn by moving DOWN. It keeps me away from the enemy's current position (4,8). Moving DOWN is also safe and good, but RIGHT gives immediate access to the nearest apple without changing my vertical alignment relative to the enemy. I will proceed with RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy Position & Intent:**\n- **Snake #0** is at (3,8) with body [(4, 8), (5, 8)] (based on the board state '0' at (3,8) and 'T T' at (4,8) and (5,8)).\n- **My Position:** I am at (7,6) with body [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6)].\n- **Movement Prediction:** The enemy is at (3,8). They likely want the apple at (4,2) or (2,2). To move there, they must go DOWN. If they go DOWN to (3,7), they are safe (board shows empty).\n- **Threat Analysis:**\n    - If the enemy moves DOWN to (3,7), distance to my head (7,6) is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} \\approx 4.12$.\n    - If the enemy moves LEFT to (2,8), they move away from the dense apple clusters in the bottom half. This is less likely.\n    - **Head-on Collision:** From (3,8), they cannot reach (7,6) in one turn. From (7,6), I cannot reach (3,8) in one turn. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**2. My Position & Safety:**\n- **Head:** (7,6)\n- **Body:** [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6)]\n- **Available Moves:**\n    - **UP (7,7):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **DOWN (7,5):** Contains an Apple 'A'. Safe.\n    - **LEFT (6,6):** Currently occupied by my own body. **UNSAFE**.\n    - **RIGHT (8,6):** Empty. Safe.\n- **Strategic Safety:** The board state shows my body occupying (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). If I move DOWN to (7,5), my body will shift to [(7,5), (6,6), (5,6)]. This leaves (4,6) empty. This is a safe configuration with an open exit (DOWN or RIGHT next turn).\n- **The Trap Risk:** If I move UP to (7,7), my body becomes [(7,7), (6,6), (5,6)]. This leaves (4,6) and (7,6) empty. (7,6) is a potential escape route next turn (DOWN or LEFT). This is also safe.\n\n**3. Apple Availability & Strategy:**\n- **Target Apple:** (7,5) is immediately adjacent.\n- **Option A (DOWN):** Eat apple at (7,5). Growth +1. Score = 4.\n- **Option B (UP):** Move to (7,7). Miss apple. Distance to (7,5) becomes 2 (DOWN-DOWN).\n- **Option C (RIGHT):** Move to (8,6). Miss apple. Distance to (7,5) becomes 2 (DOWN-LEFT).\n\n**4. Comparative Analysis:**\n- **Right (8,6):** Moving to the right edge is risky. The board is 10x10, so x=9 is the wall. If I go to (8,6), I am forced to eventually turn back. The enemy is at x=3. They are chasing apples at x=2 and x=4. We are on opposite sides of the board. It is safe to move toward the right edge, but isolating myself there limits my ability to compete for the central/lower-left apples later.\n- **Up (7,7):** Moving up takes me toward the top wall and away from the apple cluster at (5,3), (4,2), (2,2), etc. The enemy is at y=8. If I go to y=7, I am closer to the enemy's y-level, though separated by x-distance. This is suboptimal because it takes me away from the majority of the apples.\n- **Down (7,5):** This eats the immediate apple. It positions me at y=5, which is the center of the board vertically. It keeps me in contact with the dense apple field (5,3, 4,2, 2,2, 5,1, etc.). It allows flexibility to move Left, Down, or Right next turn.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** is the best move. It secures a guaranteed point, grows my snake to length 5, and places me in a central position (7,5) to pursue the next targets (5,3, 4,2, etc.) or continue exploring the right side. The enemy is far away (x=3 vs x=7) and separated by empty space.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (7,5) immediately. Then, assess the path to the apple at (5,3). If clear, proceed left/down. If the enemy approaches the central cluster, I may need to defend or cut them off. Avoid getting trapped on the right edge.\n\nDOWN\n**END RATIONALE**",

Update on Last Turn:**\n- **My Move:** I moved DOWN to (7,5) and ate the apple there.\n- **New Score:** My apples = 5.\n- **New Body:** My body is now [(7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)] (length 5). The tail (4,6) has moved on.\n- **Enemy Move:** Snake #0 was at (3,9). Based on the board state and apple proximity (Target (3,1) and (2,2)), the most logical move for Snake #0 was DOWN to (3,8). (3,8) was empty in the previous turn state.\n- **Resulting Enemy State:** Head at (3,8), Body at [(3,9), (4,8)] (assuming they didn't eat an apple, as the apple at (4,2) is still far). Their body length is 3.\n\n**2. Current Board Assessment:**\n- **My Head:** (7,5).\n- **My Body:** (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). (Tail was (4,6) previously, now gone).\n- **Enemy Head:** Likely at (3,8).\n- **Enemy Body:** (3,9) and (4,8).\n- **Distance:** I am at x=7, y=5. Enemy is at x=3, y=8. We are separated by a significant empty buffer zone.\n\n**3. Available Moves & Safety:**\n- **UP (7,6):** Blocked by my own body. **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN (7,4):** Currently empty. **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT (6,5):** Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT (8,5):** Empty. **SAFE**.\n\n**4. Strategic Selection:**\n- **Goal:** Outlast the enemy and maximize apple consumption. The enemy is likely moving down toward the central apple cluster (Target (3,1) or (4,2)). I need to secure apples before they do or cut them off.\n- **Option RIGHT (8,5):**\n  - Moves me away from the enemy (increases x-distance).\n  - Leads to an apple at (8,4) (one step down from there).\n  - However, moving right towards x=9 risks trapping myself against the wall if I continue.\n- **Option LEFT (6,5) or DOWN (7,4):**\n  - Both move me toward the dense apple cluster in the center-left of the board: (5,3), (4,2), (2,2), etc.\n  - **DOWN (7,4)** moves me to y=4, keeping me in the vertical center.\n  - **LEFT (6,5)** moves me to x=6, closer to the apples at (5,3) and (4,2).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **LEFT (6,5)** is the optimal move.\n  - **Safety:** Safe.\n  - **Progression:** Moves me closer to the apples at (5,3) and (4,2).\n  - **Positioning:** Keeps me out of the immediate corner and allows future flexibility to go DOWN or LEFT again.\n  - **Enemy Contention:** The enemy is at (3,8) moving down. By moving LEFT to (6,5), I am positioning myself to intercept or claim the apples at (5,3) and (4,2) before the enemy arrives from the top.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **LEFT** to (6,5) to approach the central apple cluster and compete for the next apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the path to the apple at (5,3) or (4,2). Monitor enemy movement; if they commit to the bottom-left area, I may need to block their access or race them to the apples.\n\nLEFT",

Game State Update:**\n- **My Move (Turn 6):** I moved `LEFT` to `(6, 5)`.\n- **Enemy Move (Turn 6):** Snake #0 (Head at `(2, 9)`) likely moved `DOWN` to `(2, 8)` based on the board state. Their body at `(3, 9)` and `(3, 8)` moves into previous head positions, resulting in a body of `(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)`.\n- **Score:** I have 5 apples, Enemy has 2 apples.\n\n**2. Board Assessment:**\n- **My Position:** Head `(6, 5)`, Body `[(6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)]` (Length 5). *Correction from turn 6 analysis: My tail was `(4, 6)`, which did not grow since I ate. The correct body list is `[(6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]`.*\n- **Enemy Position:** Head `(2, 8)`, Body `[(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]` (Length 4). They are on the left side, moving downward into the central apple cluster.\n- **Target Apples:** `(5, 3)`, `(4, 2)`, `(3, 1)`. My current position `(6, 5)` is closer to `(5, 3)` (Manhattan distance 4) than the enemy at `(2, 8)` (Manhattan distance 8). I have the lead.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation:**\n- **UP to (6, 6):** Blocked by my own body. **Unsafe**.\n- **DOWN to (6, 4):**\n  - Coordinates: `(6, 4)`.\n  - Status: Currently empty on the board.\n  - Safety: Safe. Does not hit wall or self.\n  - Progression: Moves me closer to apples `(5, 3)` and `(4, 2)`.\n- **LEFT to (5, 5):**\n  - Coordinates: `(5, 5)`.\n  - Status: Empty.\n  - Safety: Safe.\n  - Progression: Also moves closer to target apples.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n  - Coordinates: `(7, 5)`.\n  - Status: Occupied by my own body (the segment currently at `(7, 5)` will move to `(6, 5)` in the next step, but the head cannot move into the current body segment). **Unsafe**.\n\n**4. Strategic Selection:**\n- **Comparison (DOWN vs LEFT):**\n  - **LEFT (5, 5):** Reduces x-coordinate, getting closer to the left-side apple cluster. However, it keeps my y-coordinate at 5, which is high relative to the target apples (y=3, y=2).\n  - **DOWN (6, 4):** Reduces y-coordinate, dropping me into the row of apples at y=4 (apple at `(6, 4)` was eaten previously, but it's a pivot point) and y=3. This is a more direct route to the most valuable cluster `(5, 3)` and `(4, 2)`.\n- **Risk Assessment:**\n  - The enemy is at `(2, 8)` moving towards `(3, 1)`. I am at `(6, 5)`.\n  - By moving `DOWN`, I secure the vertical axis and prevent the enemy from easily cutting me off. Moving `LEFT` pushes me into the same horizontal column the enemy is approaching from, potentially creating a bottleneck.\n  - `DOWN` to `(6, 4)` offers better connectivity: I can go LEFT to `(5, 4)`, LEFT to `(4, 4)`, or DOWN to `(6, 3)` next turn.\n  - The board grid indicates an apple at `(6, 1)`. Moving `DOWN` is the only path to reach it eventually.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove `DOWN` to `(6, 4)` to descend into the central basin where the apples are clustered. This maximizes my reach to `(5, 3)` and `(4, 2)` while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy's descent vector.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nDescend to `(6, 4)`. Next turn, assess the path to `(5, 3)` and `(4, 2)`. The enemy is approaching from the top-left; I must secure the central apples before they can intercept. Watch for head-on collision risks as the enemy enters the center.\n\nDOWN",

Move Evaluation:**\n- **UP to (6, 4):** Occupied by my own body (segment at `(6, 4)`). **Unsafe**.\n- **DOWN to (6, 2):**\n  - Coordinates: `(6, 2)`.\n  - Status: Empty.\n  - Safety: Safe.\n  - Progression: Moves me closer to `(6, 1)` and `(5, 1)`.\n- **LEFT to (5, 3):**\n  - Coordinates: `(5, 3)`.\n  - Status: Contains an apple!\n  - Safety: Safe (empty).\n  - Progression: Directly eats an apple.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 3):**\n  - Coordinates: `(7, 3)`.\n  - Status: Empty.\n  - Safety: Safe.\n  - Progression: Moves away from the main apple cluster on the left/center.\n\n**4. Strategic Selection:**\n- **Comparison (LEFT vs DOWN):**\n  - **LEFT (5, 3):** This is the optimal move. It eats an apple immediately, increasing my score to 5. It positions me at `(5, 3)`, which is central to the apple cluster `(4, 2)`, `(5, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, `(3, 1)`. This secures a high-value position.\n  - **DOWN (6, 2):** This moves me closer to `(6, 1)` and `(5, 1)` but doesn't secure the immediate apple at `(5, 3)`. It leaves the apple available for potential interception, although unlikely.\n- **Risk Assessment:**\n  - The enemy is at `(1, 9)` on the opposite side of the board. They are not a threat for a collision this turn.\n  - Moving `LEFT` to `(5, 3)` is safe and productive.\n  - Moving `DOWN` is also safe, but suboptimal because I miss an immediate point and a central position.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove `LEFT` to `(5, 3)` to eat the apple and position myself centrally to attack the dense apple cluster at the bottom left.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at `(5, 3)`. From `(5, 3)`, I will have options to move `DOWN` to `(5, 2)` (empty) or `LEFT` to `(4, 3)` (empty), setting up for `(5, 1)` or `(4, 2)` next. I must monitor the enemy's movement towards the bottom left; if they descend quickly, I may need to prioritize speed over efficiency in later turns.\n\nLEFT",

I successfully ate the apple at `(5, 3)`. My score is now 5 apples.\n- **Enemy Move (Turn 8):** Snake #0 (Head at `(1, 8)`) moved `DOWN` to `(1, 8)`. Wait, looking at the current state, Enemy Head is at `(1, 8)`. Previously it was at `(1, 9)`. To go from `(1, 9)` to `(1, 8)`, the move was `DOWN`. Their body is now `[(1, 9), (2, 9)]`.\n- **Score:** I have 5 apples, Enemy has 3 apples.\n\n**2. Board Assessment:**\n- **My Position:** Head `(5, 3)`, Body `[(6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6)]` (Length 6).\n- **Enemy Position:** Head `(1, 8)`, Body `[(1, 9), (2, 9)]`.\n- **Apples:** The board shows apples at `(8, 0)`, `(4, 2)`, `(9, 7)`, `(4, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(5, 1)`, `(3, 1)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0, 5)`, `(2, 0)`, `(9, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, `(8, 4)`, `(6, 0)`, `(3, 1)`, `(4, 1)`. Note: `(3, 1)` and `(4, 1)` are still there. `(5, 3)` is now empty (I ate it).\n- **Target:** I am at `(5, 3)`. The closest apples are `(5, 1)` (distance 2), `(4, 2)` (distance 2), `(4, 1)` (distance 3), `(6, 1)` (distance 3). The enemy is at `(1, 8)`, moving towards the bottom left.\n\n**3.

Good.\n- **RIGHT to (6, 3):**\n  - Coordinates: `(6, 3)`.\n  - Status: My own body (the first segment after the head).\n  - Safety: **Unsafe** (Self-collision).\n\n**4. Strategic Selection:**\n- **Comparison (DOWN vs LEFT):**\n  - **DOWN (5, 2):** Moves me directly toward the apple at `(5, 1)`. From `(5, 2)`, I can go `LEFT` to `(4, 2)` (apple) or `DOWN` to `(5, 1)` (apple).\n  - **LEFT (4, 3):** Moves me toward `(4, 2)`. From `(4, 3)`, I can go `DOWN` to `(4, 2)` (apple) or `LEFT` to `(3, 3)`.\n  - **Risk Assessment:** The enemy is at `(1, 8)`. They are slowly descending the left side. They are not an immediate threat to me in the center/bottom-right.\n  - **Future Options:** Moving `DOWN` to `(5, 2)` keeps me on the column 5, which has apples at `(5, 1)` and `(6, 1)` nearby. Moving `LEFT` to `(4, 3)` puts me closer to `(4, 2)` and `(4, 1)`.\n  - **Decision:** Both are good, but `DOWN` to `(5, 2)` seems slightly more central and allows me to pivot either `LEFT` or `DOWN` next turn. `(5, 2)` is also safer from the enemy approaching from the left, as I am on column 5.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove `DOWN` to `(5, 2)`. This secures a position to eat `(5, 1)` or `(4, 2)` next turn. I am maintaining distance from the enemy on the left.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apples at `(5, 1)` and `(4, 2)` next.

This opens up the right side of the board `(6, 1)`, `(7, 0)`, `(8, 0)`. It keeps me in the center/right which is safer from the enemy on the left.\n  - **Future Options:** From `(5, 1)`, I can immediately go `RIGHT` to `(6, 1)` (another apple) or `LEFT` to `(4, 1)` (another apple). From `(4, 2)`, my options are `DOWN` to `(4, 1)` or `LEFT` to `(3, 2)`.\n  - **Decision:** `DOWN` to `(5, 1)` is the safer choice.

Moving `LEFT` to `(4, 2)` pushes me towards the enemy and the left wall.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove `DOWN` to `(5, 1)` to eat the apple and head towards the bottom-right cluster, maximizing safety from the distant enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat apple at `(5, 1)`.

Game State Update:**\n- **My Move (Turn 10):** I moved `DOWN` to `(5, 1)` and ate an apple. My score is now 5 (I need to correct my previous score of 4; the prompt says 4, but the board and my previous logic suggest I ate one, so I will trust the prompt: 4 apples collected. Wait, the prompt says \"Apples collected: 4\". The board shows (5, 1) as an apple, which I ate. So I will stick to the prompt's stated score of 4 apples collected).\n- **Enemy Move (Turn 10):** Snake #0 was at Head `(0, 7)`. It likely moved `UP` to `(0, 8)` or `DOWN` to `(0, 6)`. The board state shows their head at `(0, 7)`. Wait, let's look at the board state provided at the start of this turn.\n- **Board State Analysis:**\n  - My Head: `(4, 3)`.\n  - My Body: `[(4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]`.\n  - Enemy Head: `(0, 7)`.\n  - Enemy Body: `[(0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9)]`.\n  - Apples: `(8, 0), (4, 2), (9, 7), (4, 1), (2, 2), (5, 1), (3, 1), (0, 1), (0, 5), (2, 0), (5, 3), (9, 1), (6, 1), (8, 4), (6, 0)`.\n\n**2. Immediate Threats & Safety:**\n- **Self-Collision:**\n  - `UP` to `(4, 4)`: My body occupies this. **Unsafe.**\n  - `DOWN` to `(4, 2)`: Empty. Safe.\n  - `LEFT` to `(3, 3)`: Empty. Safe.\n  - `RIGHT` to `(5, 3)`: Empty. Safe.\n- **Enemy Collision:**\n  - Enemy is at `(0, 7)`. Distance is large. No immediate threat.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation:**\n- **DOWN to (4, 2):** This is an apple. Eating it increases score. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (3, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**4. Strategic Selection:**\n- **DOWN (4, 2)** is the obvious strong move. It grows my snake, securing an apple immediately adjacent to my head.\n- **RIGHT (5, 3)** moves me closer to the cluster of apples at `(6, 1)` and `(5, 1)`.\n- **LEFT (3, 3)** moves me towards `(2, 2)` (an apple).\n\nComparing **DOWN (4, 2)** and **RIGHT (5, 3)**:\n- **DOWN (4, 2)**: Eats an apple. My body length increases.\n  - Next turn options from (4, 2): UP (4,3 - body), DOWN (4,1 - apple), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2).\n  - (4, 1) is an apple.\n- **RIGHT (5, 3)**: No apple. No growth.\n  - Next turn options from (5, 3): UP (5,4 - body), DOWN (5,2), LEFT (4,3 - body), RIGHT (6,3).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to `(5, 3)`, I am adjacent to `(5, 4)` (my body). If I don't eat an apple soon, my tail will move forward, potentially trapping me or limiting options. However, looking at the board, `(5, 3)` is the \"head\" position in the ASCII art?\nLet's look closely at the ASCII art at `(5, 3)`:\n```\n 3 . . . . 1 A . . . .\n```\nThe `1` is at `(4, 3)`.\nThe `A` is at `(5, 3)`.\nWait, in the previous turn's rationale, I noted `(5, 3)` was an apple. Let's check the \"Apples at\" list in the prompt.\nApples at: (8, 0), (4, 2), (9, 7), (4, 1), (2, 2), (5, 1), (3, 1), (0, 1), (0, 5), (2, 0), (5, 3), (9, 1), (6, 1), (8, 4), (6, 0).\n\nYes, `(5, 3)` is listed as an apple.\nLet's check the ASCII art again.\nRow 3: `. . . . 1 A . . . .`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...\nAt index 4: `1` (My head at `(4, 3)`).\nAt index 5: `A` (Apple at `(5, 3)`).\n\nSo `(5, 3)` is an apple!\nMy previous analysis said `RIGHT to (5, 3): Empty. Safe.` was incorrect. It is an apple.\n\nLet's re-evaluate with this correction.\n**Current Head:** `(4, 3)`\n**Options:**\n1. **DOWN to (4, 2):** Empty (checked ASCII art row 2: `. . A . A . . . . .` at index 4 is `.`). Safe.\n2. **LEFT to (3, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n3. **RIGHT to (5, 3):** **Apple**. Safe.\n4. **UP to (4, 4):** My Body. Unsafe.\n\nSo I have three safe moves, two of which are apples: **DOWN (4, 2)** and **RIGHT (5, 3)**.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Eats apple. Grows.\n  - From (5, 3), I am very close to `(5, 1)` (apple), `(6, 1)` (apple), `(6, 0)` (apple).\n  - This moves me into the center of the board, opening up the bottom-right quadrant.\n- **DOWN to (4, 2):** Eats apple. Grows.\n  - From (4, 2), I can go to `(4, 1)` (apple) or `(3, 2)`.\n  - This keeps me on the left/center but moves downward.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to `(5, 3)` seems superior because it places me in the center of the board, directly adjacent to a cluster of three apples on the bottom row: `(5, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, and `(6, 0)`. It also avoids moving down towards `(4, 1)`, which might be slightly more crowded or wall-adjacent. Moving right gives me immediate access to the `(6, 1)` apple next turn if I choose.\n\n**Enemy Update:**\nThe enemy is still at `(0, 7)` (based on the provided board state for this turn). They are far away. I do not need to worry about them for many turns.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **RIGHT** to `(5, 3)` to eat the apple and position myself to sweep the bottom-right cluster.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat apple at `(5, 3)`. Next, move `DOWN` to `(5, 2)` (empty) or `RIGHT` to `(6, 3)` (empty), setting up for the `(6, 1)` or `(6, 0)` apples on the following turn. Maintain distance from the enemy on the left.\n\n**Final Move Selection:**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Board State Assessment:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):**\n  - **Head:** `(5, 3)`\n  - **Body:** `[(4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]`\n  - **Score:** 5 apples\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n  - **Head:** `(0, 6)`\n  - **Body:** `[(0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8)]`\n  - **Score:** 3 apples\n- **Apples:** The list includes `(5, 3)`, `(6, 1)`, `(5, 1)`, etc.\n- **Visual Check:**\n  - Row 3: `. . . . T 1 . . . .`\n  - My head is at `(5, 3)`. The prompt's \"Apples at\" list includes `(5, 3)`. However, the ASCII art shows `1` at `(5, 3)` (head) and no `A` there. The apple at `(5, 3)` was likely eaten in the previous turn (Turn 11) or is a discrepancy. Wait, looking at the \"Last Move Information\", my previous move was `DOWN` to `(5, 1)` (eating an apple). The apple at `(5, 3)` exists in the list provided for this turn. However, the ASCII art at `(5, 3)` shows `1`, which is my head.\n  - *Correction:* The ASCII art is the ground truth for collision. If `1` is at `(5, 3)`, there is no apple there *anymore*. The \"Apples at\" list might be a running total or includes an apple I am standing on. But I didn't move *to* `(5, 3)` this turn; I am arriving there now.\n  - *Wait:* My head is currently `(5, 3)` in the \"Your snake\" section. The \"Last Move\" says I moved `DOWN`. From `(4, 3)` down is `(4, 2)`.\n  - *Correction:* The \"Your snake\" section shows Head: `(5, 3)`. This implies I successfully moved to `(5, 3)`.\n  - If I am at `(5, 3)`, is there an apple?\n  - Apples at: `(5, 3)` is listed.\n  - ASCII art: Row 3: `. . . . T 1 . . . .`\n  - This is confusing. Usually, the head overlaps the apple.\n  - Let's assume the \"Apples at\" list is current. If `(5, 3)` is an apple and I am there, I have just eaten it.\n  - *Let's re-read carefully.*\n  - \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (5, 3)\"\n  - \"Apples at: ... (5, 3) ...\"\n  - This means I am currently sitting on an apple. This implies I moved there this turn and consumed it. My score should increase.\n  - However, if I am sitting on it, I don't \"see\" it on the map (it's replaced by the snake head).\n  - My previous move was `DOWN`. From `(4, 3)` down is `(4, 2)`.\n  - *Discrepancy:* The prompt says \"Head: (5, 3)\" but my last move was `DOWN` from `(4, 3)`. `(4, 3)` + `DOWN` = `(4, 2)`.\n  - *Hypothesis:* The \"Last Move Information\" block belongs to the *previous* turn (Turn 11). The state shown is *current* (Turn 12).\n  - If I am at `(5, 3)`, I must have moved `RIGHT` or `UP` from the previous position `(4, 3)`.\n  - Actually, looking at the \"Last Move Information\" again:\n    - `**START LAST MOVE PICK** RIGHT **END LAST MOVE PICK**`\n    - `**START LAST RATIONALE** ... **END LAST RATIONALE**`\n    - `RIGHT`\n    - `**END LAST RATIONALE**`\n  - The text is messy. It seems to contain logic from a previous turn where I considered moving `UP` or `RIGHT`.\n  - Let's trust the provided \"Your snake\" state: Head at `(5, 3)`.\n  - Is there an apple at `(5, 3)`? The list says yes.\n  - If I am at `(5, 3)` and it's an apple, I just ate. My score is 5. The prompt says \"Apples collected: 5\".\n  - Wait, if I ate an apple this turn, my length increases. My body list is given.\n  - Let's look at the \"Board State\" ASCII again.\n  - Row 3: `. . . . T 1 . . . .`\n  - Index 5 is `1`. This is `(5, 3)`.\n  - There is no `A` at `(5, 3)` in the ASCII.\n  - However, the explicit \"Apples at\" list includes `(5, 3)`.\n  - Usually, if you eat an apple, the apple disappears and you grow.\n  - If I am at `(5, 3)` and the apple is gone (not in ASCII), then I ate it.\n  - But the \"Apples at\" list *includes* `(5, 3)`.\n  - This suggests the \"Apples at\" list might be *pre-move* or *static*?\n  - No, the prompt says \"Apples at: ...\".\n  - If I am on `(5, 3)` and the list contains `(5, 3)`, then I am on an apple.\n  - If the ASCII doesn't show `A` there, it's because `1` (my head) hides it.\n  - So, I am on an apple. I am safe.\n\n**2. Move Options (From Head (5, 3)):**\n- **UP (5, 4):** My body is at `(5, 4)`. Unsafe.\n- **DOWN (5, 2):**\n  - ASCII Row 2: `. . A . A . . . . .` (Index 5 is `.`).\n  - Safe. No apple listed at `(5, 2)`.\n- **LEFT (4, 3):**\n  - ASCII Row 3: Index 4 is `T` (Body).\n  - Unsafe.\n- **RIGHT (6, 3):**\n  - ASCII Row 3: Index 6 is `.`.\n  - Safe.\n\n**3. Evaluation:**\n- **Safe Moves:** `DOWN` to `(5, 2)`, `RIGHT` to `(6, 3)`.\n- **Apple Proximity:**\n  - Apples nearby: `(6, 1)`, `(5, 1)`, `(6, 0)`, `(8, 0)`.\n  - Moving `DOWN` to `(5, 2)` puts me directly above `(5, 1)` (Apple).\n  - Moving `RIGHT` to `(6, 3)` puts me above `(6, 1)` and `(6, 0)`.\n- **Enemy:**\n  - Snake 0 is at `(0, 6)`. Very far away. No immediate threat.\n\n**4. Strategy:**\nI need to eat apples to win. I am currently at `(5, 3)`.\n- If I go `DOWN` to `(5, 2)`: Next turn I can go `DOWN` to `(5, 1)` (Apple) or `LEFT` to `(4, 2)` or `RIGHT` to `(6, 2)`.\n- If I go `RIGHT` to `(6, 3)`: Next turn I can go `DOWN` to `(6, 2)` or `DOWN-DOWN` logic. From `(6, 3)`, `DOWN` is `(6, 2)`. From there, `DOWN` is `(6, 1)` (Apple).\n- Both paths lead to apples.\n- `(5, 1)` is an apple. `(6, 1)` is an apple.\n- Let's look at the board geometry.\n- My body is currently `[(4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]`.\n- If I go `DOWN` to `(5, 2)`:\n  - Head: `(5, 2)`\n  - Body: `[(5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]`\n  - Next options: `DOWN` (5, 1) is Apple. `LEFT` (4, 2) is Empty. `RIGHT` (6, 2) is Empty.\n- If I go `RIGHT` to `(6, 3)`:\n  - Head: `(6, 3)`\n  - Body: `[(5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]`\n  - Next options: `DOWN` (6, 2) is Empty. `LEFT` (5, 3) is Empty (will be tail). `RIGHT` (7, 3) is Empty.\n\nComparing the \"downward\" pressure:\n- Moving `DOWN` to `(5, 2)` keeps me closer to the left wall (x=0) but offers a direct apple at `(5, 1)`.\n- Moving `RIGHT` to `(6, 3)` moves me towards the center/right.\n- There is an apple at `(6, 0)`. From `(6, 3)`, getting to `(6, 0)` takes 3 moves. From `(5, 2)`, getting to `(6, 0)` takes `(6,2)->(6,1)->(6,0)` (2 moves + 1 wait?) No, from `(5, 2)`: `RIGHT (6,2)` -> `DOWN (6,1)` -> `DOWN (6,0)`. 3 moves.\n- However, `(5, 1)` is only 1 move away from `(5, 2)`.\n- Eating `(5, 1)` is a sure thing if I move `DOWN` now.\n- `(6, 1)` is also an apple.\n- Let's look at the enemy again. He is at `(0, 6)`. He is slow. I don't need to rush away from him.\n- I should eat the closest apple.\n- From `(5, 3)`, `DOWN` leads to `(5, 2)`, then `(5, 1)` (Apple).\n- From `(5, 3)`, `RIGHT` leads to `(6, 3)`, then `(6, 2)`, then `(6, 1)` (Apple).\n- The `DOWN` path is shorter to an apple.\n- Also, checking the board: `(4, 1)` is an apple. If I go `DOWN` to `(5, 2)`, I can pivot to `(4, 2)` -> `(4, 1)`.\n- If I go `RIGHT`, I am moving away from `(4, 1)` and `(4, 2)`.\n- The area around `(5, 1)` and `(4, 1)` is dense with apples. It seems like a good \"food\" zone.\n- However, `(6, 1)` is also an apple.\n- Let's consider the \"Last Move Information\". It mentioned `RIGHT` was the last move? Or `DOWN`?\n- `**START LAST MOVE PICK** RIGHT **END LAST MOVE PICK**`\n- If the last move was `RIGHT`, my head would be at `(5, 3)` from `(4, 3)`. That matches the current state.\n- So I just moved `RIGHT` from `(4, 3)` to `(5, 3)` (eating the apple at `(5, 3)`).\n- My body is `[(4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]`.\n- The tail is at `(6, 5)`.\n- If I move `DOWN` to `(5, 2)`, my body becomes `[(5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]`.\n- If I move `RIGHT` to `(6, 3)`, my body becomes `[(5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]`.\n- Wait, if I move `DOWN` or `RIGHT`, the tail moves from `(6, 5)` to `(6, 4)`.\n- The cell `(6, 4)` becomes part of the body in both cases.\n- In the `RIGHT` move: Head `(6, 3)`. Body includes `(6, 4)`.\n- If I am at `(6, 3)` and `(6, 4)` is my body, `UP` is blocked by my own body.\n- In the `DOWN` move: Head `(5, 2)`. Body includes `(6, 4)`.\n- `UP` from `(5, 2)` is `(5, 3)` which will be the second segment of my body. Unsafe.\n- `DOWN` to `(5, 1)` (Apple). Safe.\n- `LEFT` to `(4, 2)`. Safe.\n- `RIGHT` to `(6, 2)`. Safe.\n- So from `(5, 2)`, I have 3 safe options (including an apple).\n- From `(6, 3)`:\n  - `DOWN` to `(6, 2)`. Safe.\n  - `LEFT` to `(5, 3)`. (Safe, will be empty after tail moves? No, `(5, 3)` is the 2nd segment of body).\n    - Wait, if I move `RIGHT` to `(6, 3)`: Body is `[(5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]`.\n    - `LEFT` is `(5, 3)`. This is my body. Unsafe.\n    - `UP` is `(6, 4)`. This is my body. Unsafe.\n    - `RIGHT` to `(7, 3)`. Safe.\n    - `DOWN` to `(6, 2)`. Safe.\n  - So from `(6, 3)`, I have 2 safe options.\n- From `(5, 2)`:\n  - `DOWN` to `(5, 1)` (Apple). Safe.\n  - `LEFT` to `(4, 2)`. Safe.\n  - `RIGHT` to `(6, 2)`. Safe.\n  - So from `(5, 2)`, I have 3 safe options.\n- **Decision:** `DOWN` is strictly better because it offers more mobility and immediate access to an apple at `(5, 1)` next turn. `RIGHT` restricts my movement to only `(6, 2)` and `(7, 3)`.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove `DOWN` to `(5, 2)`. Next turn, move `DOWN` to `(5, 1)` to eat the apple. This keeps me in a relatively open area near the bottom center, allowing me to sweep the bottom row apples `(5, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, `(6, 0)`.\n\n**Final Move:**\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",

It is currently stationary on the left wall. It is not an immediate threat to my current position at `(5, 2)`.\n- **Apples:** The list includes `(5, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, `(6, 0)`, `(8, 0)`, etc.\n- **ASCII Art Verification:**\n  - Row 2: `. . A . . . . . . .` (Indices 0-9). My head is at `(5, 2)`.\n  - Row 1: `A . . A A A A . . A`. `(5, 1)` is an apple. `(6, 1)` is an apple.\n  - Row 0: `. . A . . . . . . .`. `(6, 0)` is an apple.\n\n**2. Move Options (From Head (5, 2)):**\n- **UP (5, 3):**\n  - My body is at `(5, 3)`.\n  - **Result:** Death (Self-collision).\n- **DOWN (5, 1):**\n  - ASCII Row 1 shows `A` at `(5, 1)`.\n  - No snakes reported there.\n  - **Result:** Safe (Apple). Eating this apple will grow my body and score.\n- **LEFT (4, 2):**\n  - ASCII Row 2 shows `.` at `(4, 2)`.\n  - My body is at `(4, 3)`.\n  - **Result:** Safe (Empty).\n- **RIGHT (6, 2):**\n  - ASCII Row 2 shows `.` at `(6, 2)`.\n  - My body is at `(6, 4)`.\n  - **Result:** Safe (Empty).\n\n**3. Evaluation:**\n- **Immediate Survival:** Moving `UP` is fatal. `DOWN`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` are safe.\n- **Apple Acquisition:** Moving `DOWN` secures an apple immediately. Moving `LEFT` or `RIGHT` does not yield an apple on this turn.\n- **Strategic Positioning:**\n  - **Moving `DOWN` to `(5, 1)`:** This is the optimal move.\n    - **Gain:** +1 Apple (Score becomes 6). Body length increases.\n    - **Future Mobility:** From `(5, 1)`, the next turn's options will be `(5, 0)`, `(4, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, and `(5, 2)` (which will be the tail).\n    - `(4, 1)` and `(6, 1)` are both apples. Moving to `(5, 1)` creates a \"fork\" with two apple options next turn.\n    - This move advances me toward the bottom-center cluster of apples.\n  - **Moving `LEFT` to `(4, 2)`:**\n    - Safe, but no apple.\n    - Next turn I could move to `(4, 1)` (Apple).\n    - However, this is one step further from the `(6, 1)` and `(6, 0)` apples compared to the `DOWN` path.\n  - **Moving `RIGHT` to `(6, 2)`:**\n    - Safe, but no apple.\n    - Next turn I could move to `(6, 1)` (Apple).\n    - This is a strong alternative, but `DOWN` gives an immediate score lead.\n\n**4. Long-term Strategy:**\n- **Objective:** Reach 30 apples or outlast the enemy.\n- **Current Focus:** Secure the dense apple cluster at `(5, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, and `(6, 0)`.\n- **Enemy Status:** Snake 0 is stationary on the left wall. It seems to be stuck or waiting. I have time to eat apples.\n- **Decision:** Take the guaranteed apple at `(5, 1)`. The immediate point increase is valuable, and it places me in a central position relative to the bottom-row apples.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove `DOWN` to `(5, 1)` to eat the apple. On the next turn (Turn 14), evaluate moving to `(4, 1)` or `(6, 1)` to continue the harvest. Maintain awareness of Snake 0's movement; if it heads towards the center, prepare to defend or outrun it.\n\nDOWN",

A`\n  - Indices: `(0,1)` is `A`, `(3,1)` is `A`, `(4,1)` is `A`, `(6,1)` is `A`.\n  - My head is at `(5, 1)`.\n- **ASCII Art Verification (Row 0):**\n  - `. . A . . . A . A .`\n  - Indices: `(2,0)` is `A`, `(6,0)` is `A`, `(8,0)` is `A`.\n\n**2. Move Options (From Head (5, 1)):**\n- **UP (5, 2):**\n  - My body is at `(5, 2)`.\n  - **Result:** Death (Self-collision).\n- **DOWN (5, 0):**\n  - ASCII Row 0 shows `.` at `(5, 0)`.\n  - **Result:** Safe (Empty).\n  - **Future:** From `(5, 0)`, I can move to `(6, 0)` (Apple) or `(4, 0)` (Empty).\n- **LEFT (4, 1):**\n  - ASCII Row 1 shows `A` at `(4, 1)`.\n  - **Result:** Safe (Apple).\n  - **Future:** From `(4, 1)`, I can move to `(4, 0)` (Empty) or `(5, 1)` (Empty after I leave).\n- **RIGHT (6, 1):**\n  - ASCII Row 1 shows `A` at `(6, 1)`.\n  - **Result:** Safe (Apple).\n  - **Future:** From `(6, 1)`, I can move to `(6, 0)` (Apple) or `(5, 1)` (Empty after I leave).\n\n**3. Evaluation:**\n- **Immediate Survival:** Moving `UP` is fatal. `DOWN`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` are safe.\n- **Apple Acquisition:**\n  - `LEFT` and `RIGHT` provide immediate apple consumption (+1 score).\n  - `DOWN` provides safety but no immediate apple.\n- **Strategic Positioning:**\n  - **Moving `DOWN` to `(5, 0)`:**\n    - This moves me into the bottom row. While safe, it isolates me slightly from the apples at `(4, 1)` and `(6, 1)` (which I am currently adjacent to). It forces a turn where I do not gain score, while the enemy snake (though slow) remains on the board. I should prioritize score accumulation.\n  - **Moving `LEFT` to `(4, 1)`:**\n    - Consumes the apple at `(4, 1)`.\n    - Opens up `(4, 0)` for the next turn (safe empty space).\n    - Keeps me in the \"middle\" of the bottom row clusters.\n  - **Moving `RIGHT` to `(6, 1)`:**\n    - Consumes the apple at `(6, 1)`.\n    - Opens up `(6, 0)` for the next turn (Apple).\n    - Moves me closer to the `(8, 0)` apple cluster on the bottom right.\n- **Comparison:**\n  - Moving `RIGHT` offers a slight advantage over `LEFT` because from `(6, 1)`, the next immediate move `DOWN` to `(6, 0)` is *also* an apple. This creates a chain of potential score gains.\n  - Moving `LEFT` to `(4, 1)` would require a subsequent `DOWN` to `(4, 0)` which is empty.\n\n**4. Long-term Strategy:**\n- **Objective:** Maximize score velocity while maintaining safety.\n- **Current Focus:** Harvesting the bottom-center/right apple cluster `(5, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (6, 0)`.\n- **Enemy Status:** Snake 0 is inactive at `(0, 4)`. No immediate pressure from the enemy.\n- **Decision:** Move `RIGHT` to `(6, 1)`. This secures an apple immediately and positions me to secure another apple at `(6, 0)` next turn.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (6, 1) to eat the apple. On the next turn (Turn 15), move DOWN to (6, 0) to eat that apple as well. This will give me a rapid score increase and position me near the bottom-right corner apples. Keep an eye on Snake 0 in case it starts moving aggressively.\n\nRIGHT",

Current State Assessment:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):**\n  - **Head:** `(6, 1)` (I moved RIGHT from `(5, 1)` in the previous turn).\n  - **Body:** `[(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]`\n  - **Score:** 8 apples (I successfully ate the apple at `(6, 1)`).\n  - **Note:** My tail remains at `(6, 4)` as I grew.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n  - **Head:** `(1, 4)` (Assumed to have moved RIGHT from `(0, 4)` or stayed still; based on the board map, it seems he stayed or moved into `(1, 4)`).\n  - **Body:** `[(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]`\n  - **Score:** 5 apples.\n  - **Threat:** Not an immediate physical threat to my position on the right side of the board.\n- **Apples:**\n  - I am currently on `(6, 1)`, which was an apple (now eaten).\n  - The board shows apples at `(6, 0)`, `(8, 0)`, `(7, 7)`, `(9, 5)`, etc.\n\n**2. Move Options (From Head (6, 1)):**\n- **UP (6, 2):**\n  - **Board Check:** The ASCII map shows `(6, 2)` is empty (Row 2: `... A T . . . A`, index 6 is `.`).\n  - **Body Check:** My body is at `(5, 1), (5, 2)`. `(6, 2)` is not occupied by my body.\n  - **Result:** Safe (Empty).\n- **DOWN (6, 0):**\n  - **Board Check:** The ASCII map shows `(6, 0)` is an Apple (Row 0: `... A . . . A . A .`, index 6 is `A`).\n  - **Body Check:** My body is far away.\n  - **Result:** Safe (Apple). This was the planned move in the previous rationale.\n- **LEFT (5, 1):**\n  - **Body Check:** My body is at `(5, 1)`. This is directly behind my head.\n  - **Result:** **DEATH** (Self-collision / Moving backwards).\n- **RIGHT (7, 1):**\n  - **Board Check:** The ASCII map shows `(7, 1)` is empty (Row 1: `A . . A A 1 A . . A`, index 7 is `.`).\n  - **Body Check:** Safe.\n  - **Result:** Safe (Empty).\n\n**3. Evaluation:**\n- **Immediate Survival:** `LEFT` is fatal. `UP`, `DOWN`, and `RIGHT` are safe.\n- **Score & Apple Acquisition:**\n  - `DOWN` to `(6, 0)` gives an immediate apple (+1 score).\n  - `UP` to `(6, 2)` or `RIGHT` to `(7, 1)` give no immediate points.\n- **Strategic Positioning:**\n  - **Moving `DOWN` to `(6, 0)`:** This is consistent with the plan established in Turn 14. It consumes the apple at `(6, 0)`. From `(6, 0)`, I have access to `(7, 0)` and `(5, 0)` (both empty on the previous turn's map) and `(6, 1)` (which will be empty as I leave). This keeps me on the bottom row where apple density is high.\n  - **Moving `UP` to `(6, 2)`:** Moves me into row 2. While safe, I would be moving away from the immediate apple at `(6, 0)` and the cluster at the bottom right.\n  - **Moving `RIGHT` to `(7, 1)`:** Moves me closer to `(8, 1)` (Empty) and `(7, 0)` (Empty). It doesn't secure an immediate point.\n\n**4. Decision:**\n- `DOWN` is the optimal move. It secures a point immediately and aligns with the long-term strategy of harvesting the bottom row and moving towards the right side of the board.\n- The enemy snake is not close enough to interfere with this move.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (6, 0) to eat the apple. From there, I can move RIGHT to (7, 0) or LEFT to (5, 0) next turn to continue clearing the bottom row. I need to keep an eye on the apples at (8, 0) and (2, 0). If possible, I should try to move towards (9, 0) or (9, 1) to secure the apples on the far right edge, as the enemy is on the far left.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is likely to move DOWN towards (2, 3) or (2, 2), or potentially DOWN-LEFT towards (1, 3) or (1, 2). If the enemy moves DOWN to (2, 3), it creates a wall.

So (6, 1) is occupied.*\n\n2.  **DOWN (6, -1):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** y=-1 is outside the board (0-9).\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEADLY**. Off the board.\n\n3.  **LEFT (5, 0):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Is (5, 0) occupied?\n    *   **My Body:** The segment at (6, 1) is connected to (5, 1). (5, 0) is not part of my body.\n    *   **Enemy Body:** The enemy is on the left side (x=0,1). (5, 0) is far away.\n    *   **Enemy Head Prediction:** The enemy is at (2, 4). The closest apple is (2, 2) or (2, 0). If he goes for (2, 0), he moves DOWN. If he goes for (2, 2), he moves DOWN. He might also move LEFT to (1, 4). None of these paths hit (5, 0).\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 0):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Is (7, 0) occupied?\n    *   **My Body:** No.\n    *   **Enemy Body:** No.\n    *   **Apple:** (8, 0) is an apple two steps away. (7, 0) is empty.\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE**.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nI have two safe moves: LEFT to (5, 0) and RIGHT to (7, 0).\n\n*   **Option A: LEFT to (5, 0).**\n    *   This moves towards apples at (4, 0) and (2, 0).\n    *   However, the enemy snake is at (2, 4) and likely moving down the center or left side. If the enemy moves to (2, 3) or (1, 3), it might block my path to (2, 0) later.\n    *   Also, looking at my body: I am at (6, 0), body goes (6, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 2)...\n    *   If I go LEFT to (5, 0), my next turn options are:\n        *   UP: (5, 1) (Occupied by my own body segment (the one currently at (6, 1) will shift to (6, 0), and the one at (5, 1) will shift to (6, 1)? No, wait. If I move LEFT, my tail moves. The segment at (6, 4) moves to (6, 3).\n        *   Let's trace the body: Current: H(6, 0), B1(6, 1), B2(5, 1), B3(5, 2)...\n        *   If I move LEFT to (5, 0):\n            *   New Head: (5, 0)\n            *   New Body: [ (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2)... ]\n            *   If I move UP next turn from (5, 0) to (5, 1): (5, 1) is currently occupied by my body. Since I grew (ate apple at (6, 0)), the tail stays. The segment at (5, 1) does not move away immediately. It becomes (6, 1) only after I move again.\n            *   *Correction on Body Mechanics:* Since I ate at (6, 0), my tail (6, 4) stays. The body shifts.\n            *   Current: H(6,0), B1(6,1), B2(5,1), B3(5,2), B4(5,3), B5(4,3), B6(4,4), B7(5,4), B8(6,4).\n            *   Move LEFT to (5,0):\n            *   New H: (5,0).\n            *   New B1: (6,0).\n            *   New B2: (6,1).\n            *   New B3: (5,1).\n            *   New B4: (5,2).\n            *   ...Tail (6,4) remains.\n            *   **Self-Collision Check for NEXT turn:**\n                *   If I go LEFT (to 4,0): Safe.\n                *   If I go RIGHT (to 6,0): Safe (6,0 is now B1, but by next turn B1 moves to (5,0)? No.\n                *   If I go UP (to 5,1): **COLLISION**. (5,1) is New B3.\n                *   If I go DOWN: Off board.\n            *   **Result:** Moving LEFT restricts my future movement significantly. I cannot turn UP. I am essentially forced to continue LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n*   **Option B: RIGHT to (7, 0).**\n    *   This moves towards the apple at (8, 0) and (9, 1).\n    *   **Self-Collision Check for NEXT turn:**\n        *   Current: H(6,0), B1(6,1), B2(5,1)...\n        *   Move RIGHT to (7,0):\n        *   New H: (7,0).\n        *   New B1: (6,0).\n        *   New B2: (6,1).\n        *   New B3: (5,1).\n        *   ...\n        *   **Future Moves from (7,0):**\n            *   UP to (7,1): Is (7,1) occupied? No.\n            *   RIGHT to (8,0): Is (8,0) occupied? No (it's an apple).\n            *   LEFT to (6,0): Is (6,0) occupied? Yes (it's B1).\n            *   DOWN: Off board.\n        *   **Result:** Moving RIGHT allows UP or RIGHT. Moving LEFT is dangerous because (6,0) is now part of my body. However, since (6,0) is \"in front\" of me, moving LEFT would be moving into my body. Actually, let's re-verify the \"Backwards\" rule. Moving from (7,0) to (6,0) puts my head into the segment that was just my previous head position. This counts as a collision.\n        *   However, I can go UP to (7,1) or RIGHT to (8,0).\n        *   (7,1) is empty. (8,0) is an apple.\n        *   From (8,0) (if I eat), I can go to (9,0) or (8,1) or (7,0) (body).\n        *   From (7,1), I can go to (7,2), (8,1), (6,1) (occupied by body), (7,0) (occupied by body).\n        *   Wait, (6,1) is part of my body. (7,0) will be part of my body.\n        *   So from (7,1), I can go UP or RIGHT.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   **LEFT (5,0):** Moves towards enemy territory (left side). Restricts movement (cannot go UP). Forces a linear path.\n*   **RIGHT (7,0):** Moves towards empty space and apples at (8,0) and (9,1). Keeps options open (UP and RIGHT available).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 0) is the safer strategic choice. It avoids the potential congestion on the left side where the enemy is active. It opens up the right side of the board, which appears largely empty based on the map (Rows 8 and 9 are mostly dots). Even though moving LEFT would get me closer to the apple at (4,0) or (2,0), the enemy is near (2,0) and (2,2). Engaging there risks a head-on collision or being trapped. Moving RIGHT secures the corner.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (7, 0). From there, evaluate moving UP to (7, 1) to scout or RIGHT to (8, 0) to eat the next apple. Avoid the left side congestion where Snake #0 is patrolling.\n\nRIGHT",

Score becomes 9.\n    - **Next Moves:**\n        - From (8, 0), I can go to (9, 0), (8, 1), or (7, 0).\n        - (7, 0) will be occupied by my body (segment 1).\n        - (9, 0) is empty (wall).\n        - (8, 1) is empty.\n    - **Risk:** I am moving towards the right wall.\n    - **Enemy:** Enemy is at (2,3). It might move to (3,3) or (2,2). It is far away. Direct confrontation is unlikely this turn.\n\n*   **Option B: UP to (7, 1)**\n    - **Immediate Gain:** No apple (currently).\n    - **Next Moves:**\n        - From (7, 1), I can go to (7, 2), (8, 1), (6, 1).\n        - (6, 1) is part of my body (segment 2).\n        - (7, 2) is empty.\n        - (8, 1) is empty.\n    - **Risk:** I stay at x=7.\n    - **Apple Proximity:** (8, 0) is still adjacent. (6, 4) is an apple but far (requires 3 UP moves).\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nI have two safe moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 0) secures an apple immediately. This is generally good in Snake. It reduces the number of apples needed to win and denies the enemy (though the enemy is far away).\n- However, moving to (8, 0) puts me in the corner (x=8). If I eat, I grow.\n- Let's look at the board state near (8, 0).\n- Row 0: ` . . A A . . T 1 A . `\n- Indices: 0=., 1=., 2=A, 3=A, 4=., 5=., 6=T, 7=1, 8=A, 9=.\n- My head is at 7. Apple at 8.\n- If I go to 8:\n    - Head (8, 0). Body grows to include (7, 0).\n    - Next turn, options: (9, 0) [Wall], (8, 1) [Empty], (7, 0) [Body].\n    - (8, 1) is empty.\n    - If I go to (8, 1) next, I can then go to (8, 2) or (9, 1).\n    - (9, 1) is an apple.\n    - This seems like a valid path.\n- If I go UP to (7, 1):\n    - Head (7, 1).\n    - Next turn options: (7, 2), (8, 1).\n    - (7, 2) is empty.\n    - From (7, 2), I can access (6, 2), (8, 2), (7, 3).\n    - (6, 2) is empty.\n    - This keeps me more central, allowing me to go either left towards (4,2) or right towards (8,0) / (9,1).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Moving RIGHT eats an apple now.\n- Moving UP saves the apple for later but keeps me more mobile and less cornered.\n- However, in Snake, eating apples is usually priority #1 unless it traps you.\n- Is (8, 0) a trap?\n  - From (8, 0), I have 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT (if I don't crash into self)).\n  - From (7, 1), I have 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT, or LEFT (into body? No, (6,1) is body)).\n    - (6, 1) is body. So from (7, 1), I can go UP to (7, 2) or RIGHT to (8, 1).\n  - Both have similar future freedom.\n\n**Why choose RIGHT?**\nThe apple at (8, 0) is right there. It's free points. The enemy is on the other side of the board (x=2). I am at x=7. Moving to x=8 is not immediately dangerous.\nIf I go UP, I miss the apple. The apple at (8, 0) might be contested later? No, the enemy is far.\nBut why wait?\nLet's check the \"safety\" of being at (8, 0).\nIf I am at (8, 0) and eat, my body length increases.\nMy body currently ends at (5, 4).\nThe apple at (6, 4) is very close to my body. It's just above my tail (5, 4) and (4, 4).\nIf I grow, I might be able to loop around and get (6, 4) easily.\nIf I go UP, I am closer to (6, 4) and (4, 2).\nThe apple at (8, 0) is a \"safe\" apple.\nThe apple at (6, 4) is closer to my tail.\nWait, if I go RIGHT to (8, 0), I am moving away from the cluster of apples in the center (4,2), (2,2) and the apple at (6,4).\nHowever, the enemy is near the center/left.\nStaying away from the enemy is good.\nBut I also need to eat.\nLet's look at the apple list again: (8,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,5), (8,4), (7,7).\nThere is a cluster of apples on the right side!\n(8,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,5), (8,4).\nThis is a strong reason to go RIGHT. I can sweep the right side.\nIf I go UP, I head towards (6,4), (4,2), (2,2).\nThe enemy is at (2,3). If I go for (2,2) or (4,2), I engage the enemy's territory.\nThe enemy has 6 apples. I have 8.\nI should play safe and secure the right side apples.\nThe enemy is likely to move DOWN towards (2,2) or (2,0) or (3,0).\nIf I go RIGHT, I avoid that conflict entirely.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (8, 0). Eat the apple.\nFrom there, move UP to (8, 1) or (9, 1) next to get the apple at (9, 1).\nThis secures the right flank and avoids the enemy's area.\n\n**Sanity Check:**\n- Move RIGHT to (8, 0).\n- Is (8, 0) occupied? No.\n- Is it off board? No.\n- Is it my body? No.\n- Is it enemy body? No.\n- Is it backwards? No (Left is backwards).\n- Valid.\n\n**One-step look-ahead from (8, 0):**\n- Head (8, 0). Body: (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4).\n- Moves:\n    - UP (8, 1): Safe.\n    - LEFT (7, 0): Occupied by my body. **DEADLY**.\n    - DOWN: Off board.\n    - RIGHT (9, 0): Safe (Wall, but safe to move there? No, moving off board is death. (9,0) is on board. (9,0) is valid coordinate).\n- (9, 0) is empty.\n- (8, 1) is empty.\n- So from (8, 0), I have 2 safe moves (UP and RIGHT).\n- From (7, 1) (if I went UP), I have (7, 2) and (8, 1).\n- Both positions offer 2 safe moves.\n- However, (8, 0) guarantees an apple now.\n\nGiven the enemy position (2, 3) and the apple cluster on the right, moving RIGHT is the winning strategy to maximize score and safety.\n\nRIGHT",

My tail did not move, so the body list length is 9.\n- **Enemy Snake #0 Head:** (2, 2) (Based on map inactivity and previous turn analysis; the prompt did not update snake positions, so I rely on the map state relative to previous moves. However, the ASCII map for Turn 18 is identical to Turn 17. This is likely because the \"Board state\" is static in the prompt description, but I must simulate the enemy's move).\n    - *Correction:* The prompt provides a fixed ASCII map. I must treat the map as the current obstacle layout. The map shows '0' at (2,2) in previous turns? No, the map provided in the prompt shows '0' at (2,2) on Row 2.\n    - Let's look at the Prompt's Map:\n        Row 2: ` . . 0 . A T . . .

If I go UP to (8, 1) first, I can still go to (9, 1) or (8, 2).\n    - (8, 1) is strictly better than (9, 0) because it is more central and less of a corner.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the right-side apple cluster ((9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5), (8, 4)). The enemy is on the left side ((2, 2)), so there is no immediate threat.

(9, 2) is not in enemy body.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Enemy Position:** Enemy head is at (4, 2). It is moving this turn. Its body runs down the left side and bottom left.\n*   **My Position:** I am at (8, 2). I am safe in all directions except down (immediate self-collision).\n*   **Apple Availability:**\n    *   UP to (8, 3) leads towards (7, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5).\n    *   LEFT to (7, 2) leads towards the center/apples at (6, 4), (7, 5), (7, 7). However, (7, 2) is adjacent to the enemy's body at (3, 2) (distance 4, but horizontally connected). I need to be careful not to get cut off.\n    *   RIGHT to (9, 2) is an apple. This is a risky move. While it gains an apple now, it puts me against the wall at (9, 2). From there, my only safe exit is UP to (9, 3) or (9, 4) (assuming empty), or LEFT to (8, 2) (where I just was). Being against the wall severely limits my mobility and makes me vulnerable to being trapped or cut off. Given I have a lead (9 apples vs 8), I should prioritize safety and longevity over a risky immediate apple.\n    *   UP to (8, 3) seems the safest. It moves me away from the wall and the immediate enemy body. It also puts me closer to the central apple cluster (8, 4) and (9, 5). From (8, 3), I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn.\n\n**Decision:**\nAvoiding the wall trap is crucial. Moving UP maintains central control and safety.\n\nUP",

Moving into your neck would kill you. Unsafe.\n  - RIGHT to (5,2): This cell is also part of the enemy snake\u2019s body. Unsafe.\n\nConclusion:\n- The only safe move this turn is DOWN to (4,1). It keeps you alive and clears a path to nearby apples in the near future (e.g., aiming toward (3,1) on the next turn).\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After moving down, target the apple at (3,1) next turn by moving left, then proceed to other nearby apples (such as (3,0) and (0,1)) while watching the enemy\u2019s position at (8,2). Maintain a length that avoids getting boxed in by the enemy, and try to leverage the tail movement to keep your own path open.\n- If an opportunity arises to safely contest an opposing head-on collision or to cut off the enemy\u2019s path to apples, prioritize safety first but remain opportunistic to reduce the enemy\u2019s advantage.\n\nDOWN",

My body spans down to (5, 3).\n- **Enemy Snake:** Head at (4, 1). Body occupies (4, 2), (3, 2), etc. The enemy is \"below\" me in the Y coordinate but to the left. I need to be mindful of the enemy head moving towards my potential path, especially if I move left.\n- **Board State:** I am in the top-right quadrant. There are apples at (9, 2), (9, 5), (8, 4), (7, 7), etc.\n- **Score:** 9-9 Tie.\n- **Long-term Goal:** Eat apples safely and outlast the enemy. Avoid getting trapped against walls or the enemy body.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** (8, 4) is currently empty on the board map. It is not in my body list. It is not in the enemy body list.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** This moves me up and away from the enemy (who is at Y=1). It keeps me in the central column (x=8) where I have freedom to move Left or Right later. It positions me closer to the apple at (9, 5) and (7, 7). From (8, 4), I can still access the center or the right wall.\n    *   **Risk:** Low.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 3) is `T` (Trophy/Apple) on the map. It is empty of body.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Eating the apple grows my length. However, moving Left brings me closer to the enemy's body at (3, 2) and (3, 3). The enemy head at (4, 1) could move Up to (4, 2) or Right to (5, 1). If I go Left to (7, 3) and the enemy goes Right to (5, 1), the distance decreases.\n    *   **Risk:** Moderate. Eating an apple is good, but shrinking the safe space between me and the enemy is risky this early.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** (9, 3) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me against the right wall. Limits my future moves to Up, Down, or Left. While safe for one turn, it reduces maneuverability. The apple at (9, 2) is now behind me (if I came from 8,2->9,2 previously I would have eaten it, but I am at 8,3 currently, so 9,2 is Down-Right? Wait, 8,3 to 9,3 is Right. The apple at 9,2 is Down from 9,3). I prefer to stay central.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (8, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** This is where I was last turn. My body currently occupies (8, 2). Moving back hits my own body immediately. **DEADLY.**\n\n**Decision:**\n**UP** is the safest move. It avoids the wall (unlike Right), avoids the enemy (unlike Left), and avoids self-collision (unlike Down). It maintains central control and keeps options open for the next turn.\n\nUP",

Apples are abundant at (9, 7), (9, 5), (9, 2), and (8, 4).\n- **Score:** 10-10 Tie.\n- **Long-term Goal:** The enemy is currently moving towards the bottom-left/center area. I should utilize the right wall to stack apples efficiently and grow safely. Since the enemy is far away, I can likely eat several apples on the right edge without immediate interference.\n- **Immediate Move:** (8, 4) contains an apple ('A'). Moving UP to (8, 4) is safe (not occupied by self or enemy) and scores a point. It also positions me perfectly to move RIGHT to (9, 4) next, keeping my vertical alignment intact for future moves along the edge.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Empty/Aplle. Not in my body (which starts at 8,3). Not in enemy body.\n    *   **Value:** Eat apple +1. Prepares for stacking on the right edge. Keeps x=8 open to retreat or move central if needed.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Empty. Wall prevents further right, but allows Up/Down/Left.\n    *   **Value:** Good, but (8, 4) has an apple I might as well eat first. (9, 4) is empty.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Value:** Moves towards center, but I want to utilize the right wall for the stack. Also, (7, 4) has no apple.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY.** This is my current neck/segment. Moving down hits my own body immediately.\n\n**Decision:**\n**UP** is the only move that scores an apple immediately and keeps me safe.

(9, 5) is my current target.\n    *   **Column 8:** My body occupies (8, 4) through (8, 0).\n    *   **Column 7:** Apples at (7, 7), (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6). (7, 5) is directly below my current head at (8, 5).\n    *   **Left/Center:** Enemy is at the bottom left (3, 0). He is slow and far away. His body blocks (0, 0)-(4, 2) effectively.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (Starting from Head (8, 5)):**\n\n*   **UP to (8, 6):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (8, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Future Viability:** If I move Up, I go to (8, 6). From there, I can move Up to (8, 7) (empty), Left to (7, 6) (Apple), or Right to (9, 6) (empty). This keeps me close to the wall and opens up the top-right corner (9, 7) and (7, 7). This is a strong positioning move.\n    *   **Collision:** Enemy is at (3, 0), nowhere near.\n\n*   **DOWN to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (8, 4) is currently my neck/segment.\n    *   **Rule:** Moving into your own body (including backwards) is death.\n    *   **Verdict:** Immediate death. **Invalid.**\n\n*   **LEFT to (7, 5):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (7, 5) contains an Apple ('A'). No snake body occupies it.\n    *   **Collision:** Enemy is far away.\n    *   **Future Viability:** Moving here eats an apple. However, looking at the board, column 8 (the wall) is completely open *except* for my own trailing body. If I eat the apple at (7, 5), I will move into (7, 5), and my body will stretch. My next move options would be (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 6), or (8, 5). While this is safe, I want to consider if staying near the wall is better.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, eats apple.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (9, 5) contains an Apple ('A').\n    *   **Collision:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Viability:** Moving onto the wall limits movement to Down, Up, or Left. If I move to (9, 5), I eat the apple. However, (9, 5) is a \"dead end\" in the sense that I cannot move Right again. I would be forced to go Left (back to 8, 5), Up (9, 6), or Down (9, 4).\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, eats apple.\n\n**3. Strategic Comparison (Right vs. Left vs. Up):**\n\n*   **LEFT (7, 5) vs. RIGHT (9, 5):** Both are apples. The apple at (9, 5) is on the immediate right edge. The apple at (7, 5) is in the \"open\" (column 7).\n    *   *Why prefer the wall (Right)?* The enemy is on the left. Staying on the right wall keeps maximum distance from him. My body is already stacked vertically in column 8. Moving Right to (9, 5) keeps my body alignment tight.\n    *   *Why prefer the center (Left)?* (7, 5) connects to other apples in column 7 ((7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 7)). However, moving Left moves me *away* from the wall and *towards* the center/open space where the enemy might eventually turn.\n    *   *Risk of Wall:* If I go to (9, 5), I am \"backed against the wall\". If the enemy somehow rushes the right side later (unlikely), I have fewer escape routes. But currently, I am safe.\n    *   *Risk of Center:* Moving Left to (7, 5) creates a gap in my wall stack (leaving (8, 5) empty temporarily). It exposes me slightly more to the center.\n\n*   **UP (8, 6):** This is a \"soft\" move. It doesn't eat an apple immediately (8, 6 is empty), but it sets up a \"U-turn\" or a slide along the top edge.\n    *   If I go Up to (8, 6), I can immediately go Left to (7, 6) (Apple) or Right to (9, 6) (Empty), then Up to (9, 7) (Apple).\n    *   This allows me to collect (9, 7) and (7, 7) and (7, 6) in a loop.\n    *   If I go Left (7, 5) or Right (9, 5) now, I am committing to that specific square.\n\n**4. Decision:**\n\nThe enemy is slow and stuck at the bottom left. My body is a vertical line at x=8. The most valuable resource is the cluster of apples at the top right: (9, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5).\n\nIf I move **UP** to (8, 6):\n- I am safe (empty).\n- Next turn, I can choose to go **LEFT to (7, 6)** (Apple) or **RIGHT to (9, 6)** (empty).\n- If I go to (7, 6), I eat an apple and align myself with the column 7 apples.\n- If I go to (9, 6), I am positioned to eat (9, 7) next turn.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (7, 5):\n- I eat the apple immediately.\n- However, I am now lower than the top-right cluster. To reach (9, 7), I would have to path Up and Right.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (9, 5):\n- I eat the apple immediately.\n- I am on the wall. To reach (7, 7), I would have to go Up and Left.\n\n**Optimal Pathing:**\nTo eat (9, 7) and (7, 7) efficiently, I should move Up first.\nPath: (8, 5) -> (8, 6) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 7) [Eat] -> (8, 7) -> (7, 7) [Eat].\nThis path secures two apples in the corner with minimal risk. The enemy is nowhere near.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n- **UP to (8, 6):**\n  - Not off-board.\n  - Not in my body (8, 6 is empty, my body starts at 8, 4).\n  - Not in enemy body (Enemy is at (3, 0)).\n  - **Result:** Safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP is the safest strategic move. It avoids immediate wall entrapment (like Right would) and sets up a path to the most profitable apple cluster (top right) while keeping the enemy (bottom left) at maximum distance.\n\nUP",

He is trapped in the bottom-left corner, effectively blocked off by walls and his own body.\n*   **Board State (Visualized):**\n    *   **Top-Right Cluster:** Apples at (9, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (9, 5), (9, 2).\n    *   **My Body:** A vertical barrier at x=8 from y=0 to y=6.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (Starting from Head (8, 6)):**\n\n*   **UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (8, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Future Viability:** Moves me closer to (9, 7) and (7, 7). From (8, 7), I can go Left to (7, 7) [Apple] or Right to (9, 7) [Apple]. However, I must consider that (8, 7) is directly above my body column. If I go Up to (8, 7), I am essentially \"stacking\" on top of my existing column. This restricts my movement to Left or Right on the next turn.\n    *   **Risk:** While safe now, it forces me to choose Left or Right next turn, potentially trapping me if the board fills up. But the board is very open.\n    *   **Collision:** Enemy is at (3, 0), nowhere near.\n\n*   **DOWN to (8, 5):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (8, 5) is my current neck/segment.\n    *   **Rule:** Moving into your own body (including backwards) is death.\n    *   **Verdict:** Immediate death. **Invalid.**\n\n*   **LEFT to (7, 6):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (7, 6) contains an Apple ('A').\n    *   **Collision:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Viability:** This eats an apple immediately. From (7, 6), I have options: (7, 5) [Apple], (7, 7) [Apple], (6, 6) [Empty], (8, 6) [Current Head, will be empty after move]. This is a very strong position. It moves me into the center of the apple cluster.\n    *   **Comparison to UP:** Moving Left to (7, 6) allows me to eat an apple *now* and provides open space (6, 6) as an escape route. Moving Up to (8, 7) does not eat an apple immediately.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (9, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Future Viability:** Moves me onto the wall. From (9, 6), I can go Up to (9, 7) [Apple] or Down to (9, 5) [Apple]. Left is (8, 6), which will be empty. This is also a strong position.\n    *   **Comparison:** This is a setup move, similar to UP, but on the edge.\n\n**3.

Sets up a wall slide.\n*   **LEFT (7, 6):** Safe, **EATS AN APPLE**, moves into the center of the cluster.\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nThe enemy is not a threat. My priority is to maximize apple consumption while maintaining safety.\nMoving **LEFT to (7, 6)** is the most efficient move. It immediately increases my score (10 -> 11) and places my head in a position where I can immediately eat *another* apple on the very next turn (either (7, 5) or (7, 7)).\n\nIf I move Up to (8, 7) or Right to (9, 6), I am delaying my score gain. Since the board is open and the enemy is non-threatening, taking the guaranteed apple now is the best play. It also gives me the option to retreat to (6, 6) if needed in the future, providing better maneuverability than being stuck on the wall at (9, 6) or pinned at (8, 7).\n\n**Safety Check for LEFT (7, 6):**\n- **Off-board:** No.\n- **My Body:** (7, 6) is not in my body list.\n- **Enemy Body:** (7, 6) is not in enemy body list.\n- **Result:** Safe and profitable.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove Left to (7, 6) to eat the apple. On the next turn, assess whether to move to (7, 7) or (7, 5) to continue the chain, or retreat to (6, 6) if the path forward closes.\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1)].\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (1, 0). Body: [(2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5)].\n*   **Board:** My head is on an apple at (7, 6). I just ate it (Score 11 -> 12). My body extends right to (8, 6) and down.\n*   **Snake #0 Status:** The enemy is trapped in the bottom-left corner. Their head is at (1, 0). The only adjacent empty square is (1, 1) (since (2, 0) and (0, 0) are blocked by their body/walls). They are effectively slowly dying or waiting for a wall collision. They are not a threat.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (Starting from Head (7, 6)):**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 7):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (7, 7) is an Apple ('A').\n    *   **Collision:** (7, 7) is not in my body. Enemy is far away.\n    *   **Future Viability:** Eating at (7, 7) grows my tail. From (7, 7), I can go (6, 7), (8, 7), or (7, 8). (9, 7) is also accessible. This moves me toward the top-right cluster.\n    *   **Comparison:** This is a direct move towards the apple cluster at the top.\n\n*   **DOWN to (7, 5):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (7, 5) is an Apple ('A').\n    *   **Collision:** (7, 5) is not in my body. (My body is at x=8 or lower x values).\n    *   **Future Viability:** Eating at (7, 5) grows my tail. From (7, 5), I can go (6, 5), (8, 5) [Blocked by my body at (8,5) if it hasn't moved, but (8,5) is currently occupied], or (7, 4) [Apple]. (9, 5) is also an apple. However, (7, 5) is crowded with apples. (7, 4) is an apple. (7, 3) is an apple. This looks like a dense cluster.\n\n*   **LEFT to (6, 6):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (6, 6) is empty ('.').\n    *   **Collision:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Viability:** Moves away from the dense apple cluster. My only nearby apple is (6, 4). This is a retreat move, not a scoring move.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 6):**\n    *   **Safety Check:** (8, 6) is currently my neck/body.\n    *   **Collision:** Immediate death (moving into own body). **Invalid.**\n\n**3. Strategic Comparison (Up vs. Down):**\n\n*   **UP (7, 7):** Eats an apple. Leads to a cluster of apples at (9, 7), (9, 5), and (6, 7).\n*   **DOWN (7, 5):** Eats an apple. Leads to a vertical column of apples at (7, 4) and (7, 3). However, my body is currently blocking (8, 5) and (8, 4). If I go DOWN to (7, 5), I am sandwiched between my own body (x=8) and the wall (x=0).\n    *   Specifically, from (7, 5), I can go to (7, 4) [Apple].\n    *   From (7, 4), I can go to (7, 3) [Apple].\n    *   From (7, 3), I can go to (7, 2) [Empty] or (7, 4) [Apple].\n    *   This path is tight. My body at (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5) limits my rightward movement.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7, 5), I cannot go RIGHT (into body). I cannot go LEFT (empty, but less apples). I can only go DOWN (to 7,4) or UP (back to 7,6).\n    *   Once I eat the column of apples (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), I will be forced to turn. My tail is at (5,1). As I eat, my body lengthens, eventually filling (7,2), (7,1), etc. This creates a \"fence\" with my own body on the right (x=8) and potentially walls on the left (x=0, 1) or low x values.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **Down (7, 5):** Eats one apple immediately. Offers a tight vertical path. Risk of self-trapping if I eat the whole column. The vertical path (7,5 -> 7,4 -> 7,3 -> 7,2 -> ...) is narrow. My body on the right (x=8) acts as a wall. If I eat too many apples here, I might block myself in.\n    *   **Up (7, 7):** Eats one apple immediately. Offers an open top-right quadrant. The apples at (9,7) and (9,5) are accessible. The space is wider.\n\n*   **Decision Logic:**\n    The board is open. The enemy is not a threat. I need to maximize apple consumption safely.\n    While (7, 5) is an apple, the vertical column (7,5 -> 7,4 -> 7,3) is a \"trap\" waiting to happen. My body is already at x=8, y=2..5. If I go DOWN to (7,5), I am moving closer to my own body at (8,5). My tail is at (5,1). As I grow, my body will fill x=7, y=2..5. My body is already filling x=8. This creates a corridor.\n    Conversely, going UP to (7, 7) places me in the top-right, away from my body. The apples there (9,7) and (9,5) are on the wall, giving me an easy loop (Up, Right, Down, Left).\n    Additionally, (7, 7) is an apple. (9, 7) is an apple. (9, 5) is an apple.\n    (7, 5) is an apple. (7, 4) is an apple. (7, 3) is an apple.\n    The Up path offers higher mobility. The Down path is a funnel.\n\n    Let's look at the tail. My tail is at (5,1). As I eat, my body grows. If I go DOWN to (7,5), I am entering a zone where my body blocks (8,5) and (8,4). If I need to retreat, I only have left (6,5) or up (7,6). It's a one-way street into a corridor.\n    If I go UP to (7,7), I have space. (6,7), (8,7), (7,8) are all open (mostly). Even if (8,7) is eventually blocked by my body extending, (6,7) and (7,8) are open.\n\n    The most critical factor is the \"corridor\" effect. Moving DOWN into the column (7,5)-(7,3) aligns me parallel to my own body at x=8. This is mechanically risky. Moving UP moves me away from the mass of my body (which is centered at x=8) and towards open space.\n\n    Also, note the apples at (9,7) and (9,5) are very accessible from (7,7). I can simply loop (7,7)->(9,7)->(9,5)->(7,5) if I want.\n\n    Let's verify safety of UP (7, 7).\n    (7, 7) is not in my body. It is an apple.\n    Enemy is at (1, 0). No threat.\n    Future moves from (7, 7):\n    - (6, 7): Safe.\n    - (8, 7): Safe.\n    - (7, 8): Safe.\n    - (9, 7): Apple.\n\n    Let's verify safety of DOWN (7, 5).\n    (7, 5) is not in my body. It is an apple.\n    Future moves from (7, 5):\n    - (6, 5): Safe.\n    - (8, 5): **Blocked by my body** (currently at (8,5)). Wait, the move happens simultaneously. My body *will* move. But (8,5) is my current segment. If I move DOWN to (7,5), my segment at (8,6) moves to (8,5). So (8,5) will be occupied by my *new* body segment.\n    - So from (7, 5), I cannot go RIGHT to (8, 5).\n    - I can go DOWN to (7, 4).\n    - I can go LEFT to (6, 5).\n    - I can go UP to (7, 6) (which will be empty).\n    \n    This limits me to 3 directions.\n    From (7, 7), I have 4 directions (Up, Down, Left, Right) effectively (Right leads to (8,7) or (9,7)).\n    The \"Openness\" score favors UP.\n\n    Furthermore, consider the apples. (7,7) is at the top of the board. (7,5) is in the middle.\n    (7,5) is surrounded by my body at x=8 and potentially the wall at x=0 if I go further left.\n    (7,7) is near the open corner (9,9).\n\n    **Final Decision:** UP is safer and offers better long-term flow. It allows me to collect (9,7) and (9,5) easily. Going DOWN into the column is a trap.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (7, 7) to eat the apple. From there, head towards (9, 7) or (9, 5) to collect the apples on the right wall. Avoid getting trapped in the bottom-left or middle lanes. The enemy snake is trapped and not a factor.\n\nUP",

My body follows a path extending from (7, 6) down to (5, 1). The board is a 10x10 grid.\n2.  **Enemy Snake (#0):** The enemy snake is located in the bottom-left quadrant. Its head is at (1, 1). It is surrounded by its own body (e.g., (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (1, 4)) and walls, effectively trapping it. It poses no immediate threat to my current position at (7, 7).\n3.  **Apples:** There are several apples available. I am currently standing on an apple at (7, 7). If I stay or move off, I must consider the best next step.\n    *   **Apple at (7, 7):** I am currently on it. To collect it, I must survive the turn. My next move will determine my survival.\n    *   **Apple at (9, 7):** To the right. If I move RIGHT to (8, 7), (9, 7) is the next step.\n    *   **Apple at (9, 5):** To the right and down.\n    *   **Apple at (6, 9):** Up and left.\n    *   **Apple at (7, 4) & (7, 3):** Down.\n\n4.  **Move Evaluation (Starting at Head (7, 7)):**\n    *   **UP to (7, 8):** This square is empty ('.' in the board state at row 8, col 7). It is not in my body. It is within bounds. This move is safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 6):** This square is currently occupied by my own body (the neck). Moving into my own body is fatal. This move is **unsafe**.\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 7):** This square is empty ('.' in the board state at row 7, col 6). It is not in my body. It is within bounds. This move is safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 7):** This square is empty ('.' in the board state at row 7, col 8). It is not in my body. It is within bounds. This move is safe.\n\n    *Correction on previous turn's logic:* The last move rationale suggested moving UP from (7,6) to (7,7). If that move was made, my head is now at (7,7). However, the board state provided shows the snake body ending at (5,1), which is consistent with a growth of length 1 from the previous turn (tail was likely at (5,0) or similar if length increased). The key is the *current* head position and valid moves.\n\n    Wait, looking at the board state provided:\n    `7 . . . . . . . 1 . A`\n    The '1' is at x=7, y=7. This confirms my head is at (7, 7).\n    \n    Looking at my body list: `[(7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1)]`\n    The segment at (7, 6) is the neck. Moving DOWN to (7, 6) would be a collision with myself.\n\n5.  **Strategy Selection:**\n    *   **Eliminate Unsafe:** DOWN is unsafe (into neck).\n    *   **Evaluate Safe Moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT):**\n        *   **UP (7, 8):** Moves towards the top edge and the apple at (6, 9). It keeps options open. (7, 8) is empty.\n        *   **LEFT (6, 7):** Moves towards the apple at (6, 9) and (6, 4). (6, 7) is empty.\n        *   **RIGHT (8, 7):** Moves towards apples (9, 7) and (9, 5). (8, 7) is empty.\n\n    *   **Long-term consideration:** My body is currently oriented mostly vertical on the right side (x=8) and horizontal at the bottom. I have just eaten an apple (score 12), so my tail has not yet moved forward (it will move next turn if I don't eat again, or stay if I do).\n    *   The enemy is trapped in the bottom-left. I do not need to worry about them.\n    *   The apples at (9, 7) and (9, 5) are very close and on the wall. Moving RIGHT positions me to sweep the right wall, which is a generally safe strategy.\n    *   Moving UP or LEFT moves me towards the center or top-left, but RIGHT moves me towards the corner where apples are clustered (9,7), (9,5), (9,2), (9,1).\n    *   However, if I move RIGHT to (8, 7), I am approaching my own body at (8, 6). From (8, 7), I can go UP to (8, 8), DOWN to (8, 6) (blocked), or LEFT to (7, 7) (backtracking).\n    *   If I move UP to (7, 8), I am in open space. I can go LEFT to (6, 8), RIGHT to (8, 8), or UP to (7, 9).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (6, 7), I can go UP to (6, 8) or DOWN to (6, 6).\n\n    Let's compare UP vs LEFT vs RIGHT.\n    **RIGHT:** Accesses (9,7) and (9,5). Risk of getting pinned against the wall or my own body (x=8 is occupied).\n    **UP:** Accesses (6, 9) and top row. Safe, open space.\n    **LEFT:** Accesses (6, 4) and (7, 3/4). Moves towards the center.\n\n    The \"safer\" move with the most future options is usually UP or LEFT to stay away from walls and the dense body mass at x=8. However, moving RIGHT gives immediate access to apples.\n    \n    Let's re-verify the board state at (8, 7). It is empty.\n    Let's verify (7, 8). It is empty.\n    \n    If I move RIGHT, I am at (8, 7). My body will extend to (7, 7).\n    If I move UP, I am at (7, 8). My body will extend to (7, 7).\n    \n    The apples at (9, 7) and (9, 5) are very tempting. The board state shows `9 . A . . A . A . . .`. Apple at (9, 7) is the rightmost column.\n    However, if I go RIGHT to (8, 7), next turn I can go to (9, 7) to eat. From (9, 7), I can go to (9, 6) or (8, 7). (9, 6) is empty. (9, 5) is an apple.\n    \n    Actually, looking at the board again:\n    `9 . A . . A . A . . .` (Columns 0-9)\n    Row 9: `.` (0), `A` (1), `.` (2), `.` (3), `.` (4), `A` (5), `.` (6), `A` (7), `.` (8), `.` (9).\n    Wait, the formatting is slightly confusing. Let's map it.\n    Row 9 (y=9): `.` (x=0), `A` (x=1), `.` (x=2), `.` (x=3), `.` (x=4), `A` (x=5), `.` (x=6), `A` (x=7), `.` (x=8), `.` (x=9).\n    So (9, 7) is NOT an apple. (7, 9) is an apple? No, (7, 9) is the 8th element (0-indexed 7) of row 9. Row 9: `.` `. ` `A` `.` `.` `A` `.` `A` `.` `.`\n    Ah, the prompt text: `9 . A . . A . A . . .`\n    Let's index:\n    0: .\n    1: A\n    2: .\n    3: .\n    4: .\n    5: A\n    6: .\n    7: A\n    8: .\n    9: .\n    \n    So, (1, 9) is an apple.\n    (5, 9) is an apple.\n    (7, 9) is an apple.\n    \n    Where are the apples listed in the prompt?\n    `Apples at: (9, 7), (0, 1), (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 2), (6, 4), (7, 5), (7, 3), (0, 8), (6, 3), (7, 4), (4, 9), (1, 9), (0, 2), (6, 9)`\n    \n    Okay, the visual board state might be simplified or slightly off from the text list, or I am misinterpreting the visual. Let's trust the explicit list of apple coordinates.\n    My current head: (7, 7).\n    Apples:\n    (9, 7) - Far right.\n    (9, 5) - Far right.\n    (9, 2) - Far right.\n    (9, 1) - Far right.\n    (7, 5) - Below me.\n    (7, 4) - Below me.\n    (7, 3) - Below me.\n    (6, 9) - Top leftish.\n    (6, 4) - Leftish.\n    (6, 3) - Leftish.\n    (4, 9) - Top.\n    (1, 9) - Top left.\n    (1, 1) - Enemy head? No, Enemy is at (1,1). Wait, apple at (1,1)? No, apple list has (1,9). Enemy at (1,1).\n    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 8) - Left wall.\n    \n    Okay, so there are apples on the right wall (x=9) and apples below me (y=5,4,3).\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to (8, 7):\n    - Safe.\n    - Sets me up to go to (9, 7) next turn to eat.\n    - However, my body at (8, 6) and (8, 5)... if I go to (8, 7), I am approaching my own body.\n    From (8, 7), I can go to (9, 7) [Apple], (8, 8) [Empty], or (7, 7) [Retreat].\n    \n    If I move UP to (7, 8):\n    - Safe.\n    - Sets me up to go to (6, 9) or (7, 9) or (8, 9) to eat apples at (6,9), (4,9), (1,9).\n    - From (7, 8), I have (7, 9), (6, 8), (8, 8).\n    \n    If I move LEFT to (6, 7):\n    - Safe.\n    - Moves towards (6, 9) and (6, 4).\n    \n    If I move DOWN to (7, 6):\n    - Unsafe (Body at (7, 6)).\n    \n    The \"Right Wall\" apples are very attractive. (9, 7), (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 1). My body is currently mostly at x=8. If I move to (8, 7), I am \"lining up\" with my body at x=8. My body is at (8, 6), (8, 5)...\n    If I go to (8, 7), and then (9, 7), and then (9, 6)... I might run into a dead end if I don't plan well.\n    \n    However, looking at the board, the top-left has apples too: (6, 9), (4, 9), (1, 9).\n    The bottom-left has apples: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 8).\n    \n    Let's look at the enemy snake #0 again.\n    Head: (1, 1).\n    Body: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4)].\n    This snake is trapped in a box formed by walls at x=0 and y=0, and its own body. It cannot move. It will likely starve or crash into itself. It is irrelevant to my immediate survival.\n    \n    So, the game is just me and the board.\n    \n    Strategy: Maximize score.\n    Apples available: (7, 5) is very close (down 2). (6, 9) is a bit further. (9, 7) is further.\n    \n    Let's analyze the \"Down\" path again.\n    Apples at (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3).\n    My body is at x=8. (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3).\n    If I go DOWN to (7, 5) (wait, I can't, I'm at 7,7).\n    If I go DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6), I die.\n    So I cannot go DOWN.\n    \n    I must go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n    \n    RIGHT (to 8, 7):\n    - Pro: Headed towards the \"Right Wall\" apple cluster (9,7, 9,5, 9,2, 9, 1).\n    - Con: My body occupies x=8 at y=6 down to y=0. If I go to (8, 7), I am above my body. From (8, 7), I can go to (9, 7) (Apple). From (9, 7), I can go to (9, 6) (Empty), (8, 7) (Body, usually), or (9, 8) (Empty).\n    - If I eat the apples at (9,7), (9,5), etc., I will grow. My tail at (5,1) will stay put. My body length increases.\n    - Eventually, if I stay at x=9, my body will fill x=8 and x=7 etc.\n    \n    UP (to 7, 8):\n    - Pro: Moves away from the body mass at x=8. Opens up the top row.\n    - Con: Moves away from the immediate Right Wall apples.\n    \n    LEFT (to 6, 7):\n    - Pro: Closer to (6, 9) and (6, 4). Moves away from the wall.\n    - Con: Not moving towards the densest cluster of apples on the right wall?\n    \n    Let's look at the apple coordinates again.\n    (9, 7) - Right wall.\n    (9, 5) - Right wall.\n    (9, 2) - Right wall.\n    (9, 1) - Right wall.\n    There is a STRONG cluster on the right wall.\n    \n    My body is at x=8.\n    My head is at (7, 7).\n    If I move RIGHT to (8, 7):\n    I am on a safe square.\n    Next turn, I can move to (9, 7) to eat an apple.\n    If I eat (9, 7), I grow. My tail stays at (5, 1).\n    The turn after that, from (9, 7), I can move to (9, 6) or (9, 8).\n    (9, 6) is empty.\n    (9, 5) is an apple.\n    (9, 8) is empty.\n    This path seems very clear.\n    \n    Is there any risk?\n    My body at x=8, y=6..0. If I go to (8, 7), I am safe.\n    If I go to (9, 7), I am safe.\n    If I go to (9, 6), I am safe.\n    If I go to (9, 5), I am safe.\n    \n    The only risk is if I trap myself. But moving along the wall is a standard snake strategy to avoid self-collision because you only have 3 directions to check (Forward, Left/Right relative to wall, Back).\n    \n    Let's compare this to moving UP.\n    If I move UP to (7, 8):\n    Apples: (6, 9), (4, 9), (1, 9).\n    From (7, 8), I can go to (7, 9).\n    (7, 9) is an apple (according to the list? Let's check the list).\n    List: (6, 9), (4, 9), (1, 9).\n    (7, 9) is NOT in the list.\n    So moving UP to (7, 8) doesn't lead to an immediate apple at (7, 9).\n    I would have to go to (6, 9) or (4, 9).\n    \n    If I move LEFT to (6, 7):\n    Apples: (6, 9), (6, 4).\n    From (6, 7), I can go UP to (6, 8) then (6, 9).\n    (6, 9) is an apple.\n    \n    So, RIGHT puts me next to (9, 7). UP puts me next to (7, 8) (empty). LEFT puts me next to (6, 7) (empty).\n    \n    The \"Right Wall\" cluster has apples at (9,7), (9,5), (9,2), (9,1).\n    The \"Top\" cluster has (6,9), (4,9), (1,9).\n    The \"Bottom Left\" has (0,8), (0,2), (0,1).\n    \n    Given my position (7,7), the Right Wall cluster is the most aligned with my current movement and offers a high density of apples. Moving RIGHT is the most direct path to the highest value targets.\n    \n    Additionally, moving RIGHT to (8, 7) avoids my body at (7, 6) and sets up a path along the wall.\n    If I were to move UP to (7, 8), I am moving towards the center.\n    If I move LEFT to (6, 7), I am moving towards the center.\n    \n    The Right Wall is \"safe\" because the wall prevents movement in one direction, reducing the need for complex pathfinding and collision checks.\n    \n    Let's double check the board state.\n    My body:\n    (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 5) ...\n    If I move RIGHT to (8, 7):\n    Next turn, my head is (8, 7). Neck is (7, 7).\n    I can move to (9, 7). Neck moves to (8, 7). Body fills in.\n    This works.\n    \n    If I move UP to (7, 8):\n    Next turn, head (7, 8). Neck (7, 7).\n    I can move to (6, 9) or (7, 9) or (8, 8).\n    (7, 9) is empty. (6, 9) is apple.\n    \n    The density of apples on the right wall (4 apples) vs top (3 apples) is similar, but the right wall apples are closer in a straight line.\n    (9, 7) is distance 2.\n    (9, 5) is distance 4.\n    (9, 2) is distance 7.\n    (9, 1) is distance 8.\n    \n    (6, 9) is distance 3 (via UP/LEFT).\n    (4, 9) is distance 5.\n    (1, 9) is distance 8.\n    \n    Both paths offer similar potential. However, moving RIGHT to (8, 7) aligns me with the wall immediately.\n    \n    Is there any danger?\n    The enemy is at (1, 1). No danger.\n    My body is at x=8, y=6. If I go to (8, 7), I am safe.\n    \n    Let's consider the \"S-shape\" of the Right Wall.\n    From (9, 7), I can go to (9, 6).\n    From (9, 6), I can go to (9, 5).\n    My body will follow the wall.\n    \n    One detail: My body currently has a segment at (8, 6).\n    If I move to (8, 7), my body moves to (7, 7).\n    If I then move to (9, 7), my body moves to (8, 7).\n    If I then move to (9, 6), my body moves to (9, 7).\n    This is a valid loop.\n    \n    Is there a better move than RIGHT?\n    What about UP?\n    From (7, 7) UP to (7, 8).\n    From (7, 8) UP to (7, 9).\n    From (7, 9) LEFT to (6, 9) [Apple].\n    This is also valid.\n    \n    However, the apple at (9, 7) is *immediately* reachable in two moves if I go RIGHT.\n    Move 1: (7,7) -> (8, 7).\n    Move 2: (8, 7) -> (9, 7) [Eat Apple].\n    \n    If I go UP:\n    Move 1: (7, 7) -> (7, 8).\n    Move 2: (7, 8) -> (7, 9).\n    Move 3: (7, 9) -> (6, 9) [Eat Apple].\n    \n    The Right path gets an apple faster.\n    \n    Also, if I eat (9, 7), I grow. This extends my tail. This is generally good.\n    If I eat (9, 7), I can then go to (9, 6) or (9, 8).\n    (9, 5) is an apple.\n    (9, 2) is an apple.\n    (9, 1) is an apple.\n    This is a very rewarding path.\n    \n    Is there any reason NOT to go RIGHT?\n    If I go RIGHT to (8, 7), and the enemy (who is trapped) somehow dies, I win immediately. But that's not a move consideration.\n    \n    What if I move into a trap?\n    My body is at x=8, y=0 to 6.\n    If I go to (8, 7), I am essentially \"stacking\" on top of my body column.\n    If I continue to (9, 7), I am off the column.\n    If I continue to (9, 6), I am clear.\n    The path is clear.\n    \n    Let's verify the square (8, 7) one more time.\n    Board row 7: `. . . . . . . 1 . A`\n    x=0: .\n    ...\n    x=7: 1 (Head)\n    x=8: . (Empty)\n    x=9: A (Apple)\n    So (8, 7) is Empty.\n    \n    Conclusion: RIGHT is the best move to capitalize on the apple cluster on the right wall and maximize score potential.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (8, 7). This positions me directly adjacent to the apple at (9, 7). I will collect this apple next turn. From there, I will sweep down the right wall to collect the apples at (9, 5), (9, 2), and (9, 1). I must be careful not to trap myself against my own body while doing so, but the wall provides a natural guide.\n\nRIGHT",

The board has many apples, particularly along the right wall and top wall. Since the enemy is not an immediate threat (and will likely die of starvation or self-collision soon), I can focus on eating apples efficiently to reach 30 before the turn limit (150) or until the enemy dies. My current head is at (9, 7). The apple at (9, 7) is immediately available to my right at (8, 7)? No, wait. My head is at (9, 7). My body is at (8, 7), (7, 7), etc. Actually, looking at the text description:\nHead: (9, 7)\nBody: [(8, 7), (7, 7)...]\n\nSo the apple is at (9, 7)? No, looking at the apples list: (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 2), (6, 4), (7, 5), (7, 3), (0, 8), (6, 3), (7, 4), (4, 9), (1, 9), (6, 9), (4, 8), (9, 4), (4, 3).\nWait, (9, 7) is NOT in the apple list. (9, 7) is my head.\nLet me re-read the \"Board state\" ASCII art carefully.\n\n```\n 9 . A . . A . A . . .\n 8 A . . . A . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . T T 1\n```\nAt (9, 7) (x=9, y=7), the board shows '1', which is my head.\nAt (8, 7) it shows 'T' (Tail/Body).\nAt (7, 7) it shows 'T' (Tail/Body).\n\nWhere is the apple at (9, 7)? It is not listed in the apples provided. The text says \"Apples at: ... (9, 5), (9, 2), ... (9, 4)\".\nLet's look at the board again for row 7:\n`7 . . . . . . . T T 1`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(9, 7) is index 9 on row 7. The character is '1'.\n(8, 7) is index 8 on row 7. The character is 'T'.\n(7, 7) is index 7 on row 7. The character is 'T'.\n(6, 7) is index 6 on row 7. The character is '.'.\n\nWhere are the apples?\nRow 5: `5 . . . . . . . A T A`\nAt (9, 5) there is an 'A'.\nAt (7, 5) there is an 'A'.\n\nRow 7: `7 . . . . . . . T T 1` - No apples here.\nRow 8: `8 A . . . . A . . . .` - Apple at (0, 8) and (5, 8).\nRow 9: `9 . A . . A . A . . .` - Apples at (1, 9), (4, 9), (6, 9).\n\nWait, the text description of apples includes (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5). Let's check the board for these:\nRow 1: `1 T T . T T . T . T A` -> (9, 1) is 'A'. Correct.\nRow 2: `2 0 . T T T . . . T A` -> (9, 2) is 'A'. Correct.\nRow 4: `4 T T T . . . A A T A` -> (9, 4) is 'A'. Correct.\nRow 5: `5 . . . . . . . A T A` -> (9, 5) is 'A'. Correct.\n\nSo the apples on the right wall are at (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1).\nMy head is at (9, 7).\nMy body is at (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1).\n\nI am at the right edge (x=9). I cannot go RIGHT (off board).\nI must choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**Analysis of moves:**\n\n1.  **UP (9, 8):**\n    *   Coordinates: (9, 8).\n    *   Board check (Row 8): `8 A . . . . A . . . .`\n    *   At (9, 8), the board shows '.' (empty).\n    *   Is it safe? No snake bodies are there.\n    *   Is it a wall? No.\n    *   Is it my body? No.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN (9, 6):**\n    *   Coordinates: (9, 6).\n    *   Board check (Row 6): `6 . . . . . . . T T .`\n    *   At (9, 6), the board shows '.' (empty).\n    *   Is it safe? No snake bodies.\n    *   Is it a wall? No.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n3.  **LEFT (8, 7):**\n    *   Coordinates: (8, 7).\n    *   Board check: My body is at (8, 7). The text says: \"Body: [(8, 7), ...]\".\n    *   Moving LEFT would move my head into my own body.\n    *   **Result:** Unsafe (Death).\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** Impossible (x=9 is max).\n\nSo the valid moves are UP and DOWN.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMy goal is to eat apples efficiently. The apples on the right wall are at (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1).\nTo reach them, I need to go DOWN from (9, 7).\n(9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) (Apple).\n(9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) (Apple).\n(9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 2) (Apple).\n(9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 1) (Apple).\n\nIf I go UP to (9, 8), I am moving away from the cluster of apples on the right wall. While (9, 8) is empty, there are no apples directly adjacent to it except (9, 9) (which doesn't exist) or (8, 8) (empty). I would eventually have to turn around and come back down to get the apples. This wastes moves.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (9, 6), I am one step closer to the apple at (9, 5). The path downwards along the right wall appears mostly clear. My body occupies x=8, not x=9. The only potential issue is if the enemy snake moves to block me, but the enemy is at (0, 2) and trapped. They cannot reach the right side of the board in time.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is DOWN.\n\n**Safety Check (Enemy Snake #0):**\nEnemy head: (0, 2).\nEnemy body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), ... (0, 4)].\nThe enemy is surrounded by its own body and the wall. It has no valid moves. It will die next turn or soon. It poses zero threat to me at (9, 7).\n\n**Safety Check (Myself):**\nMoving DOWN to (9, 6).\nMy body is at (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6).\n(9, 6) is not in my body list.\nMoving DOWN is not a reverse of my previous move (RIGHT).\nSo it is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMove DOWN to proceed towards the apples at (9, 5), (9, 4), etc.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (0, 4) and seems to be moving into the right wall, possibly intending to encircle apples there. I have 14 apples, and the enemy has 14 apples. The game is currently tied. The apple cluster at (9, 4), (9, 2), and (9, 1) is the immediate priority. I am currently at (9, 5). Moving RIGHT to (8, 5) is necessary to avoid trapping myself at the right edge. From (8, 5), I can loop around to hit the apples on the right wall in subsequent turns, maintaining a safe distance from my own tail and the enemy.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n- **Immediate Moves:**\n    - **UP (9, 6):** Valid, open space. (However, moving UP leaves (9, 5) behind, and my tail will move to (9, 6) next turn. This might be safer long-term, but RIGHT allows more maneuverability).\n    - **DOWN (9, 4):** Valid, contains an apple. Collecting this apple is good, but being at (9, 4) puts me at the edge.\n    - **LEFT (8, 5):** Valid, open space. This is the key move to open up the board for my snake.\n    - **RIGHT:** Invalid (off board).\n- **Enemy Analysis:**\n    - Enemy head at (0, 4), body extends down and right. No immediate collision risk.\n- **Self-Collision:**\n    - Moving LEFT to (8, 5) is safe. My body occupies (8, 6), (8, 7), etc., but (8, 5) is currently free.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT (Left relative to the board direction, or rather, decreasing X from 9 to 8) is the best strategic move. Staying on the edge at (9, 4) or (9, 6) limits my escape routes and makes it harder to collect the other apples on the wall without crossing my own path. Moving into the interior (8, 5) gives me the flexibility to approach the apples (9, 4), (9, 2), and (9, 1) from multiple angles, ensuring I can collect them safely while keeping the enemy at bay.\n\nRIGHT",
