Not the most aggressive play for a lead of 8 vs 5. \ud83c\udfaf  \n\nSo the only truly safe, high\u2011impact move is **DOWN**.

Sliding into ourselves is an instant death\u2011sentence \ud83d\udeab.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 would try (2,\u202f\u20111). That\u2019s *outside* the board, so we\u2019d instantly explode \ud83c\udf0b. Dead\u2011end indeed.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 would head to (1,\u202f0). Right now that spot is empty, but look ahead: the opponent\u2019s vertical wall of zeros runs at x\u202f=\u202f1, y\u202f=\u202f2\u20118. If we ever step onto that column while they move upward, their head could crash into us **or** we could crash into theirs on the same turn \u2013 a risky head\u2011on that could wipe us both out! \u2694\ufe0f  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 would move to (3,\u202f0). That cell is also part of our own tail (the segment at (3,\u202f0) is not in our list, but the next segment (3,\u202f1) is directly above; stepping right puts us *directly in front* of the segment that will become our new tail after we move. In other words, moving right now would put our head onto the cell that our own body will occupy next turn, guaranteeing a self\u2011collision \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Which moves keep us alive right now?**  \nOnly **LEFT** avoids immediate board\u2011edge death and avoids stepping onto our own body. All other options are lethal this turn.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **But is LEFT truly safe in the long run?**  \n- If we go LEFT to (1,\u202f0), the opponent\u2019s head is currently at (1,\u202f8) and will likely move *down* or *up* this turn. Their next head position could be (1,\u202f7) or (1,\u202f9) (if they\u2019re forced to move). Either way, they will *not* be on (1,\u202f0) this turn, so we won\u2019t die from a head\u2011on collision immediately.  \n- However, after we occupy (1,\u202f0) we will be right next to the opponent\u2019s column. If they continue moving downward, they could eventually occupy (1,\u202f1) and we would be forced to move into (1,\u202f1) next turn \u2013 a forced head\u2011on that would kill us both. So we must keep an escape route open.  \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **What about staying alive while keeping options open?**  \nThe safest move that also leaves us with **multiple future safe directions** is to **move LEFT now** and then, on the next turn, we can either:  \n- **UP** into the empty space above (1,\u202f0) \u2192 (1,\u202f1) (but that's where the opponent may soon be, so risky),  \n- **DOWN** back to (1,\u202f\u20111) \u2013 illegal, so not an option, or  \n- **RIGHT** back to (2,\u202f0) \u2013 which is our original spot and currently empty (no apple there).  \n\nGiven that we have **no apple at (2,\u202f0)**, moving LEFT does not give us immediate growth, but it **preserves the possibility of later snatching an apple** on the right side of the board (the cluster of apples at x\u202f=\u202f9 is still far away, but we can build a longer body to chase them).  \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Bottom line:**  \n- **UP** and **DOWN** are dead\u2011on\u2011arrival.  \n- **RIGHT** guarantees self\u2011collision next turn.  \n- **LEFT** is the *only* move that lets us stay alive **and** keeps at least two viable follow\u2011up directions (back to (2,\u202f0) or up into the column).  \n\n\ud83e\udde0 **Strategic note for future self:** After we step LEFT to (1,\u202f0), plan to snake upward along the left edge, staying one cell away from the opponent\u2019s vertical wall, while scouting the top\u2011right apple stash. Keep the head flexible \u2013 avoid getting trapped in a narrow alley!  \n\n\ud83d\udc8e **Choose wisely:** The only move that lets us live to fight another day is **LEFT**.  \n\nLEFT",

WE'RE TRAPPED!**\nWe have NO safe moves! This is a disaster! We're completely boxed in with no escape route. The enemy has us cornered and we can't move anywhere without dying.\n\n**LAST RESORT:**\nSince we're going to die anyway, let's try to take the enemy down with us! We have no chance of survival, so let's force a head-on collision if possible.\n\nLooking at the enemy head at (1,6), if they move UP to (1,7), we could potentially move RIGHT to (1,2) for a head-on collision. But wait - their body is at (1,2) already! That's occupied.\n\nThere's literally nowhere to go. We're dead no matter what. Let's just pick a direction and go out with a bang!\n\nRIGHT",
