Given the current positions of the apples and other snakes, I need to plan a path that maximizes apple collection and minimizes the risk of running into obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board, there are five apples at the following coordinates: (3, 9), (7, 6), (9, 9), (8, 2), (4, 8). My snake is currently at (0, 4), and there is an enemy snake at (5, 9). The closest apple to me is at (4, 8), which is directly to the right of my current position. However, moving right would put me in a straight line with the enemy snake at (5, 9), which could be risky if the enemy snake moves down on its next turn.\n\nTo avoid this potential collision and to position myself better for future moves, I should first move upwards towards the apple at (3, 9). This will also put me in a better position to reach the apple at (4, 8) on the next move without aligning with the enemy snake.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (3, 9), I will be directly below the apple at (4, 8), and I can move right to collect it. After that, I will have to decide whether to move towards the apple at (7, 6) or (8, 2), considering the proximity of the other apples and the potential movements of the enemy snake.\n\nFor now, let's make the safest move that also puts us in a position to collect an apple next turn.\n\nNext move: UP.\n\nFor the next turn, I should consider moving right to collect the apple at (4, 8) and then evaluate the board again to plan my subsequent moves."
