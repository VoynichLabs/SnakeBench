Look at that board, 10x10, perfection! \ud83e\udd29\n\nThe goal is simple: Get apples, box out the competition, and survive! We are at (9, 5), practically chilling on the right wall. Snake #1 is at (4, 8) up near the top-middle.\n\nLet's check the immediate threats and opportunities!\n\n**Our Position (ID 0): (9, 5)**\nThe closest apples are:\n1. (9, 4) - Down 1.\n2. (8, 3) - Left 1, Down 2.\n3. (9, 7) - Up 2.\n\n**Opponent Position (ID 1): (4, 8)**\nTheir closest apples are:\n1. (7, 7) - Right 3, Down 1.\n2. (0, 9) - Left 4, Up 1.\n3. (2, 7) - Left 2, Down 1.\n\n**Let's analyze our safe moves from (9, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 6):** Safe. Gets us closer to the (9, 7) apple.\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 4):** Safe. Lands us on an apple! *Chef's kiss!* \ud83c\udf4e\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 5):** Safe. Puts us in the middle ground, opening up options.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 5):** KILLS US! Out of bounds! NOPE.\n\nOkay, DOWN is a guaranteed apple on Turn 1! That's huge momentum! We *have* to take that apple unless moving into it risks collision with Snake #1.\n\n**Checking for collision potential:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 8). Their possible moves are:\n*   (4, 9) UP\n*   (4, 7) DOWN\n*   (3, 8) LEFT\n*   (5, 8) RIGHT\n\nWe are moving to (9, 4). Snake #1 is nowhere near us. There is zero risk of a head-on collision or crashing into their body. This is an EZ clap move, chat!\n\n**Priority Strategy:**\n1.  Grab the easy apple at (9, 4).\n2.  After eating, we will be at (9, 4) and 1 segment long. We need to assess the next move, likely heading towards (8, 3) or (8, 2) which are also close.\n3.  Snake #1 will likely try to grab those top-left apples or the (7, 7) one. We need to grow fast before we can consider boxing them in.\n\nThis turn is a slam dunk. We are going straight for the A P P L E. Why move anywhere else when the snack is right there? \ud83c\udf4f\n\n*Long-term plan:* Secure the apples on the right side of the board (9, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3). Grow to maybe 3 segments, then start looking how to cut off Snake #1 from accessing the central lane.\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 is still chilling up at (5, 8). Time to put the pressure on!\n\n**Current State Review (Turn 1)**\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (9, 4).\n*   **Our Body/Tail:** [(9, 5)]. (We start 2 squares long when collecting the first apple, right?) *Wait, checking the rules: \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment.\" Since we started with 1 segment at (9, 5), and moved to (9, 4) which had an apple, our length is now 2. The new head is (9, 4), and the previous head/next segment is (9, 5). Correct!*\n*   **Next Closest Apples for Us:** (8, 3) (Left 1, Down 1), (8, 2) (Left 1, Down 2), (9, 7) (Up 3, but that's a detour). (7, 6) is also reachable.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (5, 8). Their closest apples are (7, 7) and (0, 9).\n\n**The Strategy: Aggression and Growth!**\n\nWe need to keep eating and growing on the right side before Snake #1 can cut us off. They are positioned to dominate the center and left top. We must secure our corner!\n\n**Analyzing Our Four Moves from (9, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 5):** DANGER! This is where our body/tail currently is! Moving UP is moving directly into our own body! **KILLS US!** ELIMINATED.\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 3):** Safe. Moves us closer to (8, 3) and (8, 2) which are Left/Down from here, and keeps us on the wall.\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 4):** Safe. Excellent move! Puts us in position to hit (8, 3) or (8, 2) next turn, and puts some distance between us and the wall (giving us more options).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 4):** **KILLS US!** Out of bounds! ELIMINATED.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: DOWN and LEFT.**\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   **DOWN (9, 3):** We stay on the wall, which is risky later, but safe for now. Next turn, we could move LEFT to (8, 3) (an apple!) OR LEFT to (8, 2) (not an apple, safer). If we move DOWN, we are one square away from the (8, 3) apple and maybe two squares away from (8, 2).\n*   **LEFT (8, 4):** We move directly adjacent to the (8, 3) and (8, 2) apples. Next turn, we can immediately move DOWN to (8, 3) for another apple! This is a much more direct path to the next immediate meal!\n\n**Let's check Snake #1's likely move (from 5, 8):**\nThey are closest to (7, 7) (Right 2, Down 1). They might go:\n*   RIGHT to (6, 8), then DOWN to (6, 7), then RIGHT to (7, 7). (3 moves)\n*   They might try to move towards the center/left.\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (6, 8), they are still far from us. Our move (8, 4) is perfectly safe and highly lucrative.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving LEFT to (8, 4) sets us up for an apple grab next turn at (8, 3). This maximizes our growth and keeps us alive. We need to grow as fast as possible to be able to trap Snake #1 later!\n\n**Strategy Update (Long-term Plan):**\nSecure the right-hand apples: (8, 3) and (8, 2). After that, we need to move quickly down to (4, 0) before sweeping back up the center. We need a length of at least 4 before we even consider getting close to Snake #1. For now, prioritize growth.\n\nLEFT",

Now we're sitting pretty right next to an apple! Is it time for the easy gobble? You BET it is!\n\nLet's look at the current board state and plan the annihilation!\n\n**Current State Review (Turn 2)**\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (8, 4).\n*   **Our Body/Tail:** [(9, 4)] (The tail will move to (9, 4) if we don't eat, or stay put if we eat). We are 2 segments long.\n*   **Target Apple:** (8, 3) is one move away (DOWN). POGGERS!\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (6, 8). Still chilling up top, but getting closer to us maybe?\n\n**Snake #1's Likely Move Analysis (From 6, 8):**\nSnake #1 is clearly trying to get to the apples on the top half.\n*   Closest apples: (7, 7) or (0, 9).\n*   If they go for (7, 7), they'd likely move RIGHT to (7, 8) or DOWN to (6, 7).\n*   If they move RIGHT to (7, 8), they are 1 step away from (7, 7). Smart move.\n*   If they move DOWN to (6, 7), they are a bit off unless they want the (7, 6) apple.\n*   Let's assume they move RIGHT to (7, 8) to secure (7, 7) in the next turn.\n\n**Our Moves from (8, 4): Time to Feast!**\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 5):** Safe. Keeps our options open, but moves us away from the immediate food source. Why ignore free points? BOO!\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 3):** APPLE ALERT! This is an immediate grab! We secure point number 2, grow our length to 3, and solidify our presence in the bottom-right quadrant.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 4):** Safe. Moves us closer to the center, perhaps to intercept Snake #1, but leaves the free apple behind. Not optimal right now.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 4):** DANGER! This is where our body/tail is (the segment directly behind our head)! Moving RIGHT is slamming the brakes on and crashing into ourselves! **KILLS US!** ELIMINATED.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, DOWN, LEFT.**\n\n**The Optimal Play: DOWN!**\n\nMoving DOWN to (8, 3) is a guaranteed apple, immediate growth, and keeps us on the attack. We need to grow fast to start forming walls and pressuring the opponent.\n\n**Collision Check (Head-on or Body Slam):**\n*   Our destination: (8, 3).\n*   Snake #1 assumed destination (7, 8). No conflict.\n*   Even if Snake #1 tries to cut us off, they are currently at (6, 8). They cannot reach (8, 3) in one move. We are safe!\n\nThis is a high-value, low-risk move. We take the apple, we grow, and we set up for the next goal: the (8, 2) apple (if Snake #1 hasn't gone for it, which is unlikely). After that, we could look down to (4, 0) or sweep left for (2, 1). We are dominating the right side!\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3-4 Turns):**\n1.  **Turn 2:** Grab (8, 3). (DOWN)\n2.  **Turn 3:** Grab (8, 2) if still there, otherwise move toward (9, 2) or (7, 4). (If (8, 2) is there, move DOWN).\n3.  **Turn 4/5:** Secure the bottom right corner, building mass, and then start pushing horizontally across the bottom towards (4, 0). Snake #1 will be trapped up north!\n\nConfidence is 100%! Let's get this $!\n\nDOWN",

We nailed that DOWN move to (8, 3) last turn, securing the bag and avoiding any drama. POGGERS!\n\nWe are 3 segments long now: Head at (8, 3), body at [(8, 4), (9, 4)]. We're looking T H I C C.\n\n## Turn 3: Strategy - Box 'Em In!\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (8, 3).\n*   **Our Body (Tail at end):** [(8, 4), (9, 4)].\n*   **Next Closest Apple:** (8, 2) is immediately below us! FREE FOOD!\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (6, 9). They moved UP from (6, 8)! They are hungry for the (0, 9) apple or the (7, 7) apple. They are now 2 segments long: Head at (6, 9), body [(6, 8)].\n\n*Wait, let's look at the board state again.*\n\nBOARD STATE:\n 9 A . . . . . 1 . . .\n...\n\nThe board shows Snake #1's head at (6, 9) (marked with '1'). They went UP last turn to get onto the high wall! Smart, but predictable. They are clearly gunning for the (0, 9) apple, or maybe pivoting for the (7, 7).\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 8, 3)\n\nWe need to secure this third apple at (8, 2) and consolidate our control over the bottom-right quadrant!\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 4):**\n    *   **DANGER!** This cell (8, 4) is currently occupied by our body. Moving here kills us (slamming into the segment directly behind our head). **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 2):**\n    *   **APPLE ALERT!** This is the next apple on the list! If we move here, we eat, we grow to 4 segments, and we are perfectly positioned to continue sweeping the bottom.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 3):**\n    *   **SAFE.** We move closer to the center. It's safe but abandons the immediate, high-value apple below us. Not optimal.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 3):**\n    *   **SAFE.** We move closer to the wall. It\u2019s safe, but doesn't get us the apple. It's a fine option if (8, 2) was blocked or dangerous, but it's not.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #1 from 6, 9)\n\nSnake #1 must move from (6, 9).\n*   **UP (to 6, 10):** Kills them (off-board).\n*   **DOWN (to 6, 8):** Kills them (into their own body).\n*   **LEFT (to 5, 9):** Safest path toward the (0, 9) apple. This is the most likely power move.\n*   **RIGHT (to 7, 9):** Safe. Keeps them near the top-right, maybe pivoting for the (9, 7) or (7, 7) apple.\n\n**Predicted Opponent Move:** LEFT to (5, 9). They want that top-left apple or they want to cross the board.\n\n### 4. Head-on Collision Check\n\n*   Our chosen move: DOWN to (8, 2).\n*   Opponent's potential moves: (5, 9) or (7, 9).\n*   Are we going to crash? NOPE! We are miles apart, separated by half the board! EZ.\n\n### 5. The Optimal Play: DOWN!\n\nWe have a clear shot at the apple at (8, 2). This increases our lead to 3 apples and our size to 4 segments. Growth is priority #1 right now so we can start walling off and trapping Snake #1 in the upper quadrant!\n\nWe should aim to secure (8, 2), then potentially pivot left to (7, 3) and start thinking about the central apples like (7, 6) and (6, 5), or continue hugging the wall to pick up (2, 1) and (4, 0).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 Turns):**\n1.  **Turn 3:** Grab (8, 2). (DOWN)\n2.  **Turn 4:** Move to (7, 2). This gets us away from our own growing tail, and sets us up to pivot toward the lower-mid quadrant. (LEFT)\n3.  **Turn 5:** Move toward (7, 3) or (6, 2). We start making our way to those central/left apples, building a wall behind us to trap Snake #1 up north.\n\nThis is a smooth move, chat. No risk, all reward. Let's get this $!\n\nDOWN",

That keeps growth momentum and opens multiple safe follow-ups.\n  - LEFT would keep us high, but the closest obvious target there is the far-left apple cluster; it\u2019s a longer detour and gives less immediate gain.\n\n- PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:\n  - Turn 3: Move RIGHT to (7,9).\n  - Turn 4: Move DOWN to (7,8).\n  - Turn 5: Move DOWN to (7,7) to eat the apple, growing and tightening the scoring.\n  - Stay flexible: watch opponent head movement; if they swing into upper-right lanes, stay in safe top-row corridors and pivot to nearby apples (e.g., (9,7) or (7,7)) as opportunities arise.

We are G R O W I N G!\n\nOur snake is now 4 segments long: Head at (8, 2), body segments [(8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4)]. We've cornered this bottom-right quadrant, and it's time to consolidate and pivot.\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 4)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (8, 2).\n*   **Our Body:** [(8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4)].\n*   **Next Closest Apple:** (9, 7) is relatively close to the wall, but also (2, 1) and (4, 0) are potential targets.\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (7, 9). *Wait, let's check the board state from the setup.*\n\nBOARD STATE:\n 9 A . . . . .

They are trying to seize the top-right corner, maybe going for the (9, 7) apple down the wall. Good tactical move by the opponent, forcing us to think about a potential collision later on. Their body is at [(6, 9)]. Length 2.\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 8, 2)\n\nWe are at (8, 2) and we need to move away from the potential clutter of our growing body segments at (8, 3) and (8, 4). The plan was to move LEFT to (7, 2), then maybe chase central apples.\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 3):**\n    *   **DANGER!** We hit our body segment directly behind the head. INSTANT DEATH. **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 1):**\n    *   **SAFE.** We move closer to the bottom edge. Sets us up for (4, 0). Safe, but maybe isolates us too much from the center.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 2):**\n    *   **SAFE.** This moves us toward the center and away from our tail segments, maximizing our escape routes. This aligns perfectly with our previous long-term strategy. Sets us up for (2, 1) or (4, 3). STRONG CONTENDER.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 2):**\n    *   **SAFE.** Runs us up against the wall. This is safe, and puts us near the tail segment (9, 4) if we decided to hug the wall and go UP. It gives us two squares of maneuverability (9, 1) or (9, 3) before we might run into danger by going UP the right wall.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #1 from 7, 9)\n\nSnake #1 must move from (7, 9). They are length 2, body at (6, 9). They likely want the (9, 7) apple or the (7, 7) apple.\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 10):** Kills them (off-board).\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 8):** Safe. Straight shot toward (7, 7) or (9, 7). Very likely path.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 9):** Kills them (into their own body).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 9):** Safe. Puts them closer to the right wall, maybe setting up a run for (9, 7). Also very likely.\n\n**Predicted Opponent Move:** DOWN to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 9). Both are strong moves. If they go DOWN, they are committing to the mid-left side of the top wall. If they go RIGHT, they are committing to the top-right corner.\n\n### 4. Head-on Collision Check & Strategy\n\nWe are at (8, 2). They are at (7, 9). Zero risk of immediate collision.\n\n**The Strategy:** We need to keep expanding our territory and stay away from our own growing body, which currently occupies the (8, 3) to (9, 4) region.\n\n*   **If we move RIGHT to (9, 2):** We become a \"wall hugger.\" We can go UP to (9, 3), then to (9, 4) (which will be safe because the tail will have moved), then keep going up the right side. This could be a good setup to claim (9, 7) if Snake #1 doesn't get there first.\n*   **If we move DOWN to (8, 1):** We secure the bottom wall. Safe, but restricts our options to eventually going LEFT for (4, 0).\n*   **If we move LEFT to (7, 2):** This opens up the center-left quadrant for us. We keep our options wide open, aiming for apples like (2, 1), (1, 4), and (4, 0). This is the most *flexible* move.\n\nGiven that Snake #1 is prioritizing the top region, we should consolidate the lower half of the board before we get big enough to cut them off. Moving LEFT allows us to hug the bottom wall *or* push up toward the center, creating a massive, safe hunting ground.\n\nThe previous plan was:\n1.  **Turn 3:** Grab (8, 2). (DOWN) - *Completed.*\n2.  **Turn 4:** Move to (7, 2). This gets us away from our own growing tail, and sets us up to pivot toward the lower-mid quadrant. (LEFT)\n3.  **Turn 5:** Move toward (7, 3) or (6, 2).\n\nThis plan still holds up. LEFT is the best move to maintain flexibility and secure control of the bottom half. By shifting left, we are minimizing the chance of walling ourselves in prematurely with our own tail, which is currently centered around (8, 3) and (8, 4).\n\nLet's execute the pivot! This is how champions secure map control!\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 Turns):**\n1. **Turn 4:** Move LEFT to (7, 2). Open up the lower-middle field.\n2. **Turn 5:** Move LEFT to (6, 2). Continue advancing, setting up a strike for (2, 1) or (4, 3)/(4, 0).\n3. **Turn 6:** Move UP (or LEFT depending on board state). Start creating a wall or claiming the (4, 3) apple. We are building massive body length to trap the opponent later!\n\nLEFT",

UP off-board, LEFT would smack into your own neck.\n\n- WHY DOWN IS PREFERRED: moving DOWN keeps you in the open top corridor and directly lines you up for the near-term apple at (7,7) in two moves, giving you growth momentum without risking a head-on with the opponent. The opponent is far away on the lower-right quadrant, so this keeps you safe and productive.\n\n- RISK CHECK: going RIGHT into (8,9) is also safe, but it delays immediate apple access and gives the opponent fewer constraints to react to; it\u2019s a slower path to growth.\n\n- PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS (short-term, flexible):\n  - Turn 4: Move DOWN to (7,8).\n  - Turn 5: Move DOWN to (7,7) and eat the apple; grow to length 3.\n  - Turn 6+: After growth, decide whether to chase (9,7) or (7,6) or pivot toward other clusters, always watching for traps and keeping space to swing away if the opponent shifts lanes.\n\n- OBJECTIVE REMINDER: keep options open, avoid getting boxed in, and stack apples to pull ahead before the final turns.\n\nDOWN",

We secured that beautiful pivot to (7, 2) last turn. We are exactly where we wanted to be.\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 5)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (7, 2).\n*   **Our Body (length 4):** [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4)]. Our tail (T) is currently at (8, 4).\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (7, 8). (They must have gone DOWN from (7, 9) last turn!)\n*   **Opponent Body (length 2):** [(7, 9)]. Their tail (T) is at (7, 9).\n\nThe board is open! Snake #1 is consolidating the top-middle wall, possibly eyeing the (7, 7) or (9, 7) apples. We've got a lock on the bottom half. Time to decide where to strike next!\n\n**Closest Apples:**\n1.  (2, 1) or (4, 0): Very reachable.\n2.  (4, 3): Slightly closer to the center.\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 7, 2)\n\nWe are at (7, 2). Our body is currently occupying (8, 2), (8, 3), and (8, 4).\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 3):**\n    *   **SAFE.** Excellent move. It opens up the lower-center column for us and sets us up beautifully for the (4, 3) apple and to start walling off the center. This is a massive territory-claiming move. **STRONG CONTENDER.**\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 1):**\n    *   **SAFE.** Sends us toward the bottom wall. A little restrictive compared to UP, but keeps us safe and near the bottom apples. Okay move.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 2):**\n    *   **SAFE.** Pushes us further into the lower-left territory, securing the path toward (2, 1) and (4, 0). Also a very solid, highly flexible move. **STRONG CONTENDER.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 2):**\n    *   **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment immediately behind the head. INSTANT DEATH. **ELIMINATED!** (Never go backward, CHAT!)\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, DOWN, LEFT.**\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #1 from 7, 8)\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 8) with their body at (7, 9). They are length 2.\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 9):** Kills them (into their own body).\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 7):** **APPLE GRAB!** Hits the (7, 7) apple. They gain length and score. HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 8):** Safe. Moves them away from the apple, but gives them options toward the (0, 9) apple. Unlikely if they see the easy grab.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 8):** Safe. Moves them toward the right wall, keeping the option for (9, 7).\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 goes **DOWN** to (7, 7) to eat the apple. This means their new head is (7, 7) and their new tail is (7, 9). Length 3.\n\n### 4. Strategic Duel & The Box-in Plan\n\nWe are playing a T E R R I T O R Y game right now. We need massive body length to set up the trap! Snake #1 is making a classic mistake: going straight for the nearest apple without thinking about position.\n\nIf Snake #1 goes to (7, 7), they will be relatively trapped along the 7-column until they move LEFT or RIGHT. We need to use this moment to gain position and length in the center.\n\n**Comparing UP vs. LEFT for ID 0:**\n\n*   **Move LEFT (to 6, 2):** This continues our run along the y=2 line, giving us a free straight shot at (2, 1) if we want it. It's safe and predictable. It secures the *floor*.\n*   **Move UP (to 7, 3):** This pushes us vertically into the central area. It's aggressive, and positions us well to grab the (4, 3) apple or even (1, 5). Crucially, by moving up the 7-column, we are moving *parallel* to the opponent's main line of movement a few squares away (7, 8 to 7, 7). This allows us to start building a wall that will eventually cut off the entire central-right of the board, trapping them above the y=5 line.\n\nBecause Snake #1 is heading down the 7-column, our move **UP** to (7, 3) is a powerful, tactical counter-play. We move directly into the center, securing our high-ground position, while the opponent focuses on a temporary apple grab. We are creating a **box** for the mid-game!\n\nLet's stick to the aggressive, area-control move! UP to (7, 3). This is content, CHAT!\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 Turns):**\n1. **Turn 5:** Move UP to (7, 3). Claim the central-right entry point.\n2. **Turn 6:** Move LEFT to (6, 3). Start pushing toward the (4, 3) apple.\n3. **Turn 7:** Move LEFT to (5, 3) or UP to (6, 4). Continue expanding to claim the most central apples and grow our body length substantially for the box-in maneuver.\n\nLet's go for the ceiling!\n\nUP",

We correctly anticipated Snake #1's apple grab, and now we are positioned perfectly to start the boxing process!\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 6)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (7, 3).\n*   **Our Body (length 4, since we didn't eat an apple):** [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3)]. Our tail is at (8, 3).\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (7, 7). They ate the apple!\n*   **Opponent Body (length 3):** [(7, 8), (7, 9)]. Their tail is at (7, 9).\n*   **Score:** 3-3! Snake #1 stole that (7, 7) apple, so the pressure is ON! We need to react fast!\n\nWe are locked and loaded at (7, 3). Snake #1 is sitting on the 7-column four spaces away at (7, 7). They are currently blocking off the upper-right corner effectively. We are targeting the central mass!\n\n**Closest Apples:**\n1. (4, 3): Only 3 moves away! Direct path is (7, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (4, 3) [EAT]. This is our priority target!\n2. (2, 7) or (3, 7): They are further, but good targets for expansion.\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 7, 3)\n\nWe are at (7, 3). Our body segment is at (7, 2).\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 4):**\n    *   **SAFE.** Pushing straight up the 7-column. This maintains our central position, but moving parallel towards Snake #1 is always risky, and the next apple isn't directly up. Solid option, but better moves exist.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 2):**\n    *   **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment immediately behind the head. INSTANT DEATH. **ELIMINATED!**\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 3):**\n    *   **SAFE.** This moves us directly onto the highway toward the (4, 3) apple. It's safe, and it begins our crucial cross-board journey to claim the center. **STRONGEST CONTENDER.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 3):**\n    *   **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment (our tail is *moving off* of (8, 3) to (7, 2) on the simultaneous move, but the move definition applies to the *current* list of body segments). Wait, let's re-read the state: Our body is [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3)]. Yes, (8, 3) is our tail, but it's *still there* when we make the decision. Moving RIGHT hits (8, 3) and is **DANGER! ELIMINATED!** (Never go toward your own body unless you know the tail will vacate! Here, the tail moves from (8, 3) to (7, 2), but the body shrinks from the *end* after the move resolution, not before. The list is explicit: move into a listed segment = death.) Wait, no! The tail moves from (8, 3) to (7, 2) on the previous turn. Where did my tail go?!\n\n**Let's re-examine the full move resolution sequence from Turn 5:**\n*   **Start T5 Head:** (7, 2). Body: [(8, 2), (8, 3)]. Length 3.\n*   **Move:** UP to (7, 3).\n*   **End T5 Head:** (7, 3). **New Body:** [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3)]. Length 4.\n*   **T6 State Head:** (7, 3). Body: [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3)].\n*   **Conclusion:** (8, 3) IS our current tail segment, and we cannot move there.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, LEFT.**\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #1 from 7, 7)\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 7), length 3. Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9)]. Their tail is at (7, 9).\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 8):** Kills them (into their own body).\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 6):** **APPLE GRAB?** No apple at (7, 6). Safe move. This is a common \"consolidation\" move, moving them toward the (7, 6) apple's neighbor.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 7):** Safe. Pushes them toward the (2, 7) or (3, 7) apples. Likely move to escape the straight jacket of the 7-column. **HIGH LIKELIHOOD.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 7):** Safe. Pushes them toward the (9, 7) apple.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 will see the trap on the 7-column and move **LEFT** to (6, 7) or **RIGHT** to (8, 7) to pursue the next apple. If they go LEFT, they might aim for (3, 7) or (2, 7). If they go RIGHT, they go for (9, 7). Moving LEFT is more central and therefore usually preferred.\n\n### 4. Strategic Duel & The Box-in Plan Continuation\n\nWe need to grab (4, 3) and expand our length! The aggressive middle push is our best bet for two reasons:\nA) It secures an easy apple (+1 length).\nB) It builds a dense body in the highly valuable central-mid area, setting us up to cut the map in half.\n\n**The Move: LEFT to (6, 3)**\n\n*   This instantly puts us on the path to (4, 3).\n*   It keeps us far away from Snake #1's predicted move (LEFT to 6, 7, or RIGHT to 8, 7, both four squares away). No head collision risk!\n\nWhat about UP to (7, 4)? It's safe, but it delays the apple and keeps us in a column where Snake #1 *might* eventually crash into us if they decide to push downward without thinking (though they are far). Moving LEFT gives us maximum tactical space and immediate objective completion (the apple hunt).\n\nWe are executing the wall-building plan perfectly!\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 Turns):**\n1. **Turn 6:** Move LEFT to (6, 3). Secure the path.\n2. **Turn 7:** Move LEFT to (5, 3). Set up the final apple grab.\n3. **Turn 8:** Move LEFT to (4, 3). EAT THE APPLE! Gain length (5 segments)!\n\nThis establishes our dominance in the lower-middle half of the board using our length advantage! Let's get this!\n\nLEFT",

Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 7)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (6, 3). Length 4.\n*   **Our Body:** [(7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2)]. Our tail is at (8, 2).\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (7, 6). Length 4. (They must have moved DOWN to 7, 6, since they have 3 apples and their body is [(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9)] - Wait, hold on, let's look at the body list.\n\n**RE-CALCULATING OPPONENT MOVE - Turn 6 to Turn 7:**\n*   Start T6 Head: (7, 7). Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9)]. Length 3.\n*   We assumed they went LEFT (to 6, 7) or RIGHT (to 8, 7). Let's check the current body of Snake #1: Head: (7, 6), Body: [(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9)]. Apple count is still 3.\n*   **AHA!** Snake #1 moved **DOWN** to (7, 6) on Turn 6! They didn't eat an apple, so their length is 4 (Head + 3 body segments). Their tail vacated (7, 9).\n    *   *Correction on my previous rationale:* Snake #1's move was DOWN, *not* LEFT or RIGHT. They are still vertical on the 7-column, right in the center of the board, four segments long. They are sitting right next to that (6, 5) apple drop!\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 6, 3)\n\nWe are at (6, 3). Our goal is the (4, 3) apple!\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 4):**\n    *   SAFE. This allows us to cut across the board up high, setting up for (6, 5) or the row of apples at y=4 if we loop around. Good option for path variability.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 2):**\n    *   SAFE. Also good for path variability, gets us far from Snake #1.\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 3):**\n    *   **CRITICAL MOVE.** This continues our path directly to the (4, 3) apple. No body conflict. **STRONGEST CONTENDER.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 3):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Hits our own body segment immediately behind the head. INSTANT DEATH. **ELIMINATED!**\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, DOWN, LEFT.**\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #1 from 7, 6)\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 6). Length 4. Body: [(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9)].\n\nThey are sitting right next to the (6, 5) apple! What's the play, Snake #1?\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 7):** Kills them (hits their own body).\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 5):** Safe. Moves away from the edge, but away from the apple.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 6):** Safe. Puts them perfectly in line to grab (6, 5) next turn (Move to 6, 5, then EAT). This is the most *logical* apple grab for them. **HIGH LIKELIHOOD.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 6):** Safe. Distant from apples. Low likelihood.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 is going LEFT to (6, 6). They want that (6, 5) apple!\n\n### 4. Strategic Implications & The BOX-IN Plan\n\nSnake #1 pivoting LEFT to (6, 6) is a good thing for us right now, even if they aim for the apple. Why? Because we can extend our wall without interference from them for at least two more turns!\n\n**Our Move: LEFT to (5, 3)**\n\n*   This guarantees that on Turn 8, we move LEFT to (4, 3) and eat our fourth apple!\n*   It immediately adds length to our snake, which is crucial for cutting off the board.\n*   We are moving across the bottom-center, while Snake #1 is moving across the upper-center. The split is happening!\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our head will be at (5, 3).\n*   Snake #1\u2019s head is predicted to be at (6, 6).\n*   No collision risk! We are completely safe.\n\n**Alternative: UP to (6, 4)?**\nIf we move UP, we start to converge on the area Snake #1 is entering. If they go to (6, 6) and we go to (6, 4), they are two squares away. This is still safe, but delaying the guaranteed apple grab for (4, 3) when we are this close is bad stream strategy! Secure the *easy* point first, chat!\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 Turns for ID 0):**\n1. **Turn 7 (NOW):** Move LEFT to (5, 3). Final approach to the apple.\n2. **Turn 8:** Move LEFT to (4, 3). **EAT THE APPLE!** Length 5! Block the y=3 row for Snake #1.\n3. **Turn 9:** After eating the apple, our head is at (4, 3). We need to decide:\n    *   Go UP to (4, 4) to grab the (4, 0) apple next, or...\n    *   Go DOWN to (4, 2) to continue building our wall segment toward the bottom-left harvest (A, A, A at (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)).\n\nWe are sticking to the plan. Secure the apple, build the wall. Let's make this content, chat! BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

OPPONENT #0 AT (6,3), BODY (7,3)->(7,2)->(8,2). LET\u2019S PLAY SMART, BOX HIM IN, KEEP OPTIONS OPEN, AND EAT THOSE APPLES.\n\n- SAFE MOVES FROM (7,6): UP would hit your own neck (blocked). DOWN goes to (7,5). LEFT goes to (6,6). RIGHT goes to (8,6). All three (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) look safe this turn; UP is out.\n- APPLES nearby: there\u2019s activity along the left side and a few mid-board targets. Moving toward the left side keeps us in a richer apple corridor and away from the other snake\u2019s headspace for now.\n- HEAD-ON CONSIDERATION: Opponent\u2019s head is at (6,3). They\u2019re far from immediate collision on any of our SAFE moves this turn, so we\u2019re not risking a head-on this turn by choosing LEFT.\n\nPlan:\n- Short-term: PICK LEFT to (6,6). This keeps a couple safe exits open (not trapped by our own body) and nudges us toward the left-side apple cluster (e.g., the apple at (6,5) vicinity). If an apple is eaten on the next turn, we\u2019ll grow and keep room to maneuver.\n- Mid-term: Maintain two or three escape options (stay away from tight corners like top-right) while collecting nearby apples. Avoid steering into a bottleneck where the opponent could force a trap.\n- Long-term: Use the open central-left corridor to threaten apples and keep options to pivot toward either the left border apple set or back toward the center if the rival makes a push. Stay off the top row to avoid closing in on your own neck.\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turns:\n- Prioritize keeping at least two safe exit routes after each move.\n- If the opponent moves toward the central strip, consider gently constraining their space by stepping into free lanes that don\u2019t pinch us against our tail; force them into a suboptimal turn to create a box where we can control the pace.\n- Eat apples when safe and when it doesn\u2019t crater our mobility\u2014advantage if we can out-sustain the other snake in apple count.\n\nLEFT",

Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 8)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (5, 3). Length 4.\n*   **Our Body (ID 0):** [(6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2)].

Moves into open space, but away from the apple. Low priority.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 2):**\n    *   SAFE. Moves into open space, away from the apple. Low priority.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 3):**\n    *   **APPLE GRAB!** This is the move, chat! We eat the apple at (4, 3).

Secure the point, earn the length!\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #1 from 6, 6)\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 6). Length 4. They are clearly eying the (6, 5) apple, which is right below them.\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 7):** Safe. Moves away from the apple.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 5):** **APPLE GRAB!** They will become length 5. This is the most logical strategic move for them. **HIGH LIKELIHOOD.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 6):** Safe. Keeps them high, but away from the closest apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 6):** Kills them (hits their own body). **ELIMINATED!**\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 moves DOWN to (6, 5) and eats the apple. Score will be 4-4.\n\n### 4. Collision Check & Strategic Implications\n\n*   Our Head: (4, 3) - Eating apple.\n*   Snake #1 Head: (6, 5) - Eating apple.\n*   Is there any head-on collision risk? Nope! We are two squares apart on the X-axis and two squares apart on the Y-axis. Perfect safety!\n\n### 5. Long-Term Wall Construction Plan (Turn 9 and Beyond)\n\nWe will be at (4, 3), length 5, having successfully claimed the center-bottom of the map. Snake #1 will be at (6, 5), length 5, claiming the center-top. The map is officially split!\n\n**Objective: Box in Snake #1 on the left/top side of the board.**\n\n1.  **Turn 8 (NOW):** Move LEFT to (4, 3) [EAT].\n2.  **Turn 9 (Next Move):** Head is at (4, 3). We now need to pivot efficiently to harvest the cluster of apples on the left side: (4, 0), and the y=4 cluster ((0, 4), (1, 4)).\n    *   A strong move would be **UP to (4, 4)**. This puts us next to the next apple target: (1, 5). We start moving towards the upper-left quadrant to create our segment of control.\n3.  **Turn 10:** If we went UP to (4, 4), we could move LEFT to (3, 4).\n4.  **Turn 11:** LEFT to (2, 4), then eventually down to (4, 0).\n\nSnake #1 will likely try to snake around in the top-right block (y > 5, x > 5) since they are long and established there. If we create a solid barrier up the x=4/x=5 column, we severely limit their movement options and funnel them into the top row, where they will run out of real estate!\n\nThis is the path to victory, chat! Secure the point, then build the Great Wall of (4)!\n\nLEFT",

Our rival, Snake #1, is also length 5 and currently chillin' up at (6, 5).\n\nIt's time to build the wall and starve the competition! We're at Turn 9. Let's do this!\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 9)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (4, 3). Length 5.\n*   **Our Body (ID 0):** [(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2)]. Our tail will vacate (7, 2) unless we eat an apple.\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (6, 5). Length 5.\n*   **Opponent Body (Snake #1):** [(6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)]. Their tail will vacate (7, 8) unless they eat an apple.\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 4, 3)\n\nWe need to start making our way to the left side to clean up that cluster and set up a vertical boxing wall around x=4/x=5.\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 4):**\n    *   SAFE. Moves into open space, perfectly positioning us to swing into the left quadrant. GREAT move.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 2):**\n    *   SAFE. Moves toward the (4, 0) apple. Also a good option, but prioritizing the higher ground for the box.\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 3):**\n    *   SAFE. Moves toward the left wall. Good for future apples (like (1, 4), (0, 4)).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 3):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Hits our own body segment. OH NO! INSTANT DEATH. **ELIMINATED!**\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. All of them lead to further harvesting on the left side. Let's look at the opponent's moves to avoid collision and maximize our positional advantage.\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #1 from 6, 5)\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (6, 5). They are surrounded by empty space, except for our wall growing in the central-low columns (x=4/5/6/7) and the map edge. Their last move was successfully grabbing the (6, 5) apple.\n\nAvailable apples near them: (9, 7), (1, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8). The top-right seems ripe for the picking.\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 6):** Kills them (hits their own body segment they haven't vacated yet). **ELIMINATED!** *Wait, their body segment (6, 6) will be vacated if they didn't eat an apple last turn. Wait, they DID eat an apple last turn! So their body segment at (6, 6) is STILL part of their body. Any move that tries to go back to (6, 6) is a self-kill!* **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 4):** Safe. Moves them further away from the top apples.\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 5):** Safe. Puts them closer to the center line (x=5), and on a path toward (3, 7). This is a strong move towards mid-board territory.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 5):** Safe. Puts them into the top-right block, away from center.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 will go LEFT to (5, 5) to challenge the center, or RIGHT to (7, 5) to stay high and seek out (9, 7). (5, 5) seems more strategically aggressive.\n\n### 4. Collision Check & Decision\n\n*   **Our Move UP to (4, 4):** No collision with (5, 5) or (7, 5). Safe. Sets up a nice path to (1, 5) and the cluster above.\n*   **Our Move DOWN to (4, 2):** No collision. Safe.\n*   **Our Move LEFT to (3, 3):** No collision. Safe.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves to (5, 5), if we went to (4, 4), they are one square away diagonally. We are building a high wall.\n\nMy original plan was to build up the x=4 column. **UP to (4, 4)** is the perfect move to start this vertical control, pressing toward the dense cluster of apples on the upper left (A at (0, 9), A at (1, 7), A at (0, 6), A at (2, 7)).\n\nLet's maintain pressure and extend our reach upwards! The opponent is busy on the right side. We harvest the left, then we seal them in.\n\n**Strategizing the Box Wall:**\n1.  **Turn 9 (NOW):** UP to (4, 4).\n2.  **Turn 10:** LEFT to (3, 4) or UP to (4, 5). (4, 5) is safer as it maintains the vertical wall and blocks the opponent's potential descent.\n3.  **Turn 11:** Continue moving UP the x=4/x=3 column to severely restrict Snake #1's options to the right half of the board.\n\nUP is the move, chat! Let's get high ground! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nUP",

I\u2019m leaning LEFT to start carving a long corridor and reach the left apple cluster without getting boxed in.\n\nRationale in short:\n- Safety check: DOWN (6,4), LEFT (5,5), and RIGHT (7,5) all avoid colliding with either snake\u2019s body this turn. UP would slam into our own neck.\n- Strategic plan: Heading LEFT opens a wide, empty corridor along row y=5. It gives multiple escape routes, keeps us away from Snake 0\u2019s bottleneck near (4,3), and lines us up to grab apples at (1,5), (1,4), and (0,4) over the next few moves.\n- Vision: If Snake 0 pursues the center-left path, we maintain options to dodge and still chase left apples; if they retreat right, we can pivot to DOWN toward lower-left apples or swing back toward the center.\n\nLong-term plan notes (for the next few turns):\n- Turn 9: Move LEFT to (5,5) to lock in the left corridor.\n- Turns 10\u201313: Traverse left along y=5 toward (1,5) and (1,4), aiming to eat those apples and extend the lead.\n- Always keep at least two safe exits (e.g., back toward the middle or up/down corridors) to avoid getting boxed in by Snake 0.\n- If Snake 0 crashes or blocks themselves, press the advantage toward the remaining apple hotspots (left cluster first, then bottom/right as needed).\n\nLEFT",

We OWN this central line now. \ud83d\udc51\n\nIt looks like Snake #1 dodged my projected move and went **LEFT** to (5, 5)! No collision, but they are now right on our flank. They're trying to challenge the center! We gotta push them back, or box them in on the right side.\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 10)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (4, 4). Length 5.\n    *   Body: [(4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3)]\n    *   Tail will vacate (7, 3) if we don't eat.\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (5, 5). Length 5.\n    *   Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7)]\n    *   Tail will vacate (7, 7) if they don't eat.\n*   **Closest Apples:** (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 4), (0, 6) on the Left. (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 2) Central.\n\nOur plan: Build the vertical wall on x=3/x=4 to seal off the left half for ourselves and force Snake #1 into the barren right half.\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 4, 4)\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 5):**\n    *   SAFE. Moves into open space, continues building the vertical wall, and pressures Snake #1 who is at (5, 5). This severely limits Snake #1's ability to cross to the west. Excellent control move.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 3):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Hits our own body segment. We just vacated it, but since we didn't eat, our body only moved one square. **ELIMINATED!** (Wait, *my* body is [(4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3)]. My head is at (4, 4). Moving DOWN lands on (4, 3). Yes, INSTANT DEATH.)\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 4):**\n    *   SAFE. Moves toward the (1, 4) and (0, 4) cluster. Solid food option.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 4):**\n    *   SAFE. Moves right next to Snake #1 (5, 5). This is risky for a collision, but it cuts off the path underneath #1.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. UP and LEFT focus on the territorial control and apple advantage.\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent and Collision (Snake #1 from 5, 5)\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 5). They are highly motivated to go LEFT now to capture the center and challenge the left-side apples.\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 6):** Safe. Moves them towards the top-left apples, potentially aiming for (3, 7) or (2, 7).\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 4):** Safe. *Potential collision!* If we choose RIGHT, we both move into (5, 4) -> **DOUBLE KO!** A risky move for them and us.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 5):** Safe. *Potential collision!* If we choose UP, we both move into (4, 5) -> **DOUBLE KO!** Highly probable move for them, as it moves them to the center-left.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 5):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Hits their own body segment (6, 5). **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1's best moves are UP (5, 6) or LEFT (4, 5). LEFT is highly threatening to our position.\n\n### 4. Collision Check & Decision\n\nWe are at (4, 4).\nSnake #1 is at (5, 5).\n\n*   **If we move UP (to 4, 5) and they move LEFT (to 4, 5):** **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** DOUBLE DEATH. This is a high-probability conflict point if they prioritize moving left.\n*   **If we move LEFT (to 3, 4):** No immediate collision risk. We move safely into the apple territory.\n    *   If they go UP (5, 6): We are safe.\n    *   If they go LEFT (4, 5): We are safe.\n*   **If we move RIGHT (to 5, 4) and they move DOWN (to 5, 4):** **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** DOUBLE DEATH. Less likely, but possible.\n\nCHAT, we need to secure this left quadrant without risking the Double KO!\n\nIf we go UP, we aggressively commit to the vertical wall, but we rely on Snake #1 choosing UP (5, 6) or DOWN (5, 4) to survive. If they go LEFT, we die together. I can't risk the Double KO when we have such great apple access on the left.\n\nIf we go LEFT (3, 4), we claim the prime path to (1, 4), (0, 4), and (1, 5). We force Snake #1 to either keep moving up and around us, or descend into the already claimed bottom-center. This is the safer, greedy move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Go LEFT to (3, 4). Secure the (1, 4) and (1, 5) apples. This draws a diagonal separation line from (3, 4) to (4, 5), giving us the whole west side. We let the opponent take (4, 5) for now, then we come back and box them in from the bottom. Safe plays, better pathing.\n\nLEFT is the move, secure the apples and avoid the inevitable Head-On!

No body collision risk this turn, keeps options open.\n  - DOWN to (5,4): could invite a head-on collision if Snake 0 toes RIGHT into (5,4); not worth the gamble.\n  - LEFT to (4,5): could clash if Snake 0 moves UP to (4,5) this turn.\n  - RIGHT to (6,5): ILLEGAL (it's into our own neck).\n\n- CURRENT STRATEGY\n  - Our immediate priority is to stay alive while preserving multiple escape routes. Moving UP preserves space and avoids a direct clash this turn.\n  - The long-term plan remains to press toward the left apple cluster (1,5), (1,4), (0,4) along the y=5 corridor when safe, then pivot as Snake 0 moves.\n\n- HEAD-TO-HEAD CONSIDERATIONS\n  - Snake 0 sits at (4,4) with a neck at (4,3). They can choose Up (4,5), Left (3,4), or Right (5,4). A Right move would threaten a potential mutual crash if we also go to (5,4); Up to (4,5) would threaten our LEFT option if we commit there. Staying UP avoids giving them an immediate boxed-in opportunity.\n\n- LONG-TERM OUTLOOK\n  - Survive first, then chase left-side apples while keeping two exits.\n  - If Snake 0 dives center, we carve the left corridor and grab (1,5)/(1,4)/(0,4). If they rush right, we pivot toward the bottom-left cluster and bend back toward center as needed.\n\nPlan for next turns (high level)\n- Secure UP to (5,6) now.\n- From there, evaluate whether to drift left along y=6 or shift up to set up a clean traverse toward the left apple trio.\n- Maintain at least two escape routes to avoid being boxed in by Snake 0.\n\nFinal move direction for this turn:\n- UP",

We're tied 4-4, but look at the board, we have the apple advantage on the West! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nSnake #1, however, snagged the center and is now at (5, 6). They moved UP, avoiding the central collision point. Clever. Now, the battlefield is clearly defined. We own the left/bottom, they own the right/top. Time to choke 'em out!\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 11)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (3, 4). Length 5.\n    *   Body: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)]\n    *   Tail will vacate (6, 3) if we don't eat.\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (5, 6). Length 5.\n    *   Body: [(5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6)]\n    *   Tail will vacate (7, 6) if they don't eat.\n*   **Closest Apples:** (1, 4), (1, 5) are RIGHT THERE! (0, 4) is accessible. (3, 7) and (2, 7) are also juicy targets.\n\nOur plan remains: *Control the left quadrant, eat the apples, and use our body to create an impassable wall, trapping Snake #1 in the upper right.*\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 3, 4)\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 5):**\n    *   SAFE. Moves us towards the central vertical apples. Keeps us away from the opponent's current location. Excellent for central control.\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 3):**\n    *   SAFE. Moves into open territory. Not aimed at immediate apples, but expands our control downwards.\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 4):**\n    *   SAFE. DIRECT path to the cluster of apples at (1, 4) and (1, 5)! HIGH PRIORITY.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 4):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Hits our own body segment (4, 4)! We just left it! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. LEFT is the clear objective winner, as it targets multiple apples.\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent and Collision (Snake #1 from 5, 6)\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 6). They have access to the apples on the top edge and are heavily motivated to move into the left side for the superior apple cluster.\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 7):** Safe. Moves them near (3, 7) and (2, 7). Logical apple path.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 5):** Safe. Moves them away from all immediate apples, but maybe they are trying to box us from the bottom? Less likely.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 6):** Safe. *Potential collision risk with our future path if we go UP next turn.* This is a strong move for them, asserting presence on the central dividing line.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 6):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Hits their own body segment (6, 6). **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1's best moves are UP (5, 7) or LEFT (4, 6). They will prioritize food or cutting us off.\n\n### 4. Collision Check & Decision\n\nWe are at (3, 4). We want to go LEFT to (2, 4).\nSnake #1 is at (5, 6). They will likely go UP (5, 7) or LEFT (4, 6).\n\n*   **We move LEFT (3, 4) -> (2, 4):**\n    *   If they move UP (5, 7): Safe. We claim the path to the western apples.\n    *   If they move LEFT (4, 6): Safe. They are one step higher than us and we are fine.\n    *   No immediate collision risk whatsoever with our primary choice, LEFT.\n\nLEFT is the safest and most profitable move. It secures the rich apple cluster on the west side right now. This is a crucial move for accumulating score and length, allowing us to build the wall.\n\n**Next Turns Strategy:** After (2, 4), we move UP (2, 5) (snagging (1, 5) or setting up for it), then LEFT (1, 5 or 1, 4) to clean up the cluster. This forces Snake #1 to fight for the sparse upper-right apples or try to squeeze down the center, which we will block with our growing body.\n\nLEFT it is, CHAT! Time to farm, then box! \ud83d\udce6\n\nLEFT",

That puts them dangerously close to the center-top apples, and crucially, it left a gap in the center. We need to capitalize on this and continue our farm-and-box strategy!\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 12)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (2, 4). Length 5 (We did not eat last turn).\n    *   Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3)]\n    *   Tail will vacate (5, 3) if we don't eat.\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (5, 7).

LEFT is the clear winner as it guarantees an apple and length.\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent and Collision (Snake #1 from 5, 7)\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 7). They are eyeing the apples (3, 7), (2, 7), (9, 7), and (3, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 8):** Safe. Moves toward (3, 8). Also moves away from us.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 6):** Safe. Moves back into their body's old spot. Less aggressive.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 7):** Safe. *Asserts deep into the center.* This is their best move if they want to contest the western apples at (2, 7) and (3, 7). This move is *highly likely* as it targets multiple food sources and puts pressure on us.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 7):** Safe. Targets (9, 7). A safe, food-focused move.\n\nThe most aggressive/competitive move for Snake #1 is LEFT (4, 7).\n\n### 4. Collision Check & Decision\n\n*   **Our primary move is LEFT (2, 4) -> (1, 4) [EATING APPLE]:** A guaranteed life-saving, length-boosting move!\n*   If we move LEFT:\n    *   If Snake #1 moves RIGHT (6, 7): Safe. We are far apart.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves UP (5, 8): Safe. We are far apart.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves LEFT (4, 7): Safe. We are far apart.\n    *   No head-to-head collision risk exists for moving LEFT.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, CHAT! We have a clear shot at the apple, which grants us immediate length and control. We take the apple, Snake #1 gets pushed further away, allowing us to finish building our impenetrable wall!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Eat (1, 4). Next turn, move UP to (1, 5) for another apple. Then, move LEFT to (0, 5) or (0, 4), securing the corner and increasing our length to *7*. This length will be vital for sealing the center and ensuring Snake #1 is trapped in the upper-right corner (x>4, y>5). We are locking down this flank!\n\nLet's GOOOOO!

We just devoured that apple at (1, 4)! **SIX APPLES!** The setup is looking crisp like a Granny Smith! \ud83c\udf4f We are now the longest snake on the board, and we are perfectly positioned to seize the entire western half! Snake #1 is starting to look boxed in!\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 13)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (1, 4). Length 6 (We just ate! +1 content for the stream!).\n    *   Body: [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3)]\n    *   Tail will vacate (5, 3) (since we ate, the tail stays put and the list is shifted).\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (4, 7). Length 5 (I see they moved LEFT from (5, 7) to (4, 7)! Smart, but dangerous!).\n    *   Body: [(5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5)]\n    *   Tail will vacate (6, 5) if they don't eat.\n*   **Closest Apples:** (1, 5) is one step UP. (0, 4) is one step LEFT. (2, 7) and (3, 7) are two steps away, and Snake #1 is already close.\n\nOur plan: Dive deeper into the corner, increase length to 7, and close the trap!\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 1, 4)\n\nWe are at (1, 4). We need to maximize our apple momentum and corner security.\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 5):**\n    *   **APPLE ALERT!** There's an apple at (1, 5)! This is a guaranteed meal! This is HUGE!\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, 3):**\n    *   Safe. Moves away from the action. Low priority.\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 4):**\n    *   **APPLE ALERT!** There's an apple at (0, 4)! Another guaranteed meal!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 4):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Hits our own body segment (2, 4)! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nWe have two moves targeting apples: UP and LEFT. Which one is strategically better for boxing in Snake #1?\n\n*   **If we move UP (1, 5):** We stay on the x=1 line, maintaining vertical pressure, and getting ready to turn LEFT towards the (0, 9) apple path.\n*   **If we move LEFT (0, 4):** We secure the lower-left corner immediately. This sets us up to crawl up the x=0 wall, which is a key barrier in our boxing strategy.\n\nBoth are amazing for the score, but securing the wall is priority. We need to create an impenetrable barrier!\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent and Collision (Snake #1 from 4, 7)\n\nSnake #1 is at (4, 7). They are aggressively centered, targeting (3, 7) or (2, 7) or (3, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 8):** Safe. Targets (3, 8). A good, safe move.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 6):** Safe. Moves into the open space their body just vacated. Less aggressive.\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 7):** **APPLE ALERT!** Targets (3, 7)! This is their most likely aggressive move.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 7):** Safe. Moves back into their body's start position. Low value.\n\nIf we go LEFT (0, 4), they will likely go LEFT (3, 7). No collision.\nIf we go UP (1, 5), they will likely go LEFT (3, 7). No collision.\n\n### 4. Decision: Left vs. Up\n\nThe goal is to increase length and claim territory.\n\n1.  **Choosing LEFT (0, 4):**\n    *   Pros: Secures the actual corner boundary (x=0). Sets up our movement along the western wall. Guarantees apple #7.\n    *   Cons: Pulls us slightly away from the center cluster of apples (1, 5), (2, 7).\n\n2.  **Choosing UP (1, 5):**\n    *   Pros: Guarantees apple #7. Puts us in position to immediately claim (0, 5) or (2, 5) next, potentially keeping us relevant for the center apples contested by Snake #1.\n    *   Cons: We leave (0, 4) open for a long time, though Snake #1 is very far from getting there.\n\nIf we go UP to (1, 5), we can then choose between (0, 5) or (2, 5). If we go LEFT to (0, 4), we are locked into moving UP the column.\n\nSince Snake #1 is heavily focused on the (3, 7) / (2, 7) area, we need to maintain pressure on *our* side while getting max length. Moving UP towards (1, 5) gives us flexibility. Next turn, we can take (0, 5), walling off the western side further and continuing to grow towards (0, 9).\n\nLet's go UP, CHAT! Secure (1, 5)! Then we will move LEFT to (0, 5) to solidify the boundary! Box in the opponent! The path is clear!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:**\nT13: UP to (1, 5) [EAT]\nT14: LEFT to (0, 5) (Wall confirmed!)\nT15: UP to (0, 6) [EAT] (Continuing the wall!)\n\nWe are going for length for territory control! LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nUP",

No head-on risk now; you\u2019re not boxed in by walls yet.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS (to remind myself): push left along the apple line, eat (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (1,7) if safe, keep multiple escape routes by occasionally stepping UP or DOWN to avoid a tight wedge.\n\nLEFT",

The energy is electric! \u26a1\ufe0f Snake #1 is starting to look awfully cozy in that upper-middle section, but we are building a brick wall on the left side!\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 14)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (1, 5). Length 7 (We just ate! The tail remains at (5, 3)).\n    *   Body: [(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3)]\n    *   We are now LONG. Very, very long.\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (3, 7). Length 6 (They moved LEFT from (4, 7) to (3, 7) and ATE the apple at (3, 7)! Smart move, gotta give them props! They are now tied for length!)\n    *   Body: [(4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5)]\n    *   Their tail is at (6, 5) and will remain there.\n*   **Closest Apples:** (0, 6) is two steps away. (0, 4) is two steps away. (2, 7) is two steps away, and Snake #1 is right there. (3, 8) is three steps away.\n\nThe primary goal remains the same: secure the Western boundary (the x=0 column) and maximize our length advantage to totally dominate future territory. Snake #1 is now very healthy, and dangerously close to the (2, 7) apple. We need to be fast.\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 1, 5)\n\nWe are at (1, 5). We planned to move LEFT to (0, 5) last turn. Does that still check out?\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 6):**\n    *   Safe. Keeps us moving vertically. Sets us up for the (0, 6) apple.\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, 4):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Hits our own body segment (1, 4). **ELIMINATED!**\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 5):**\n    *   Safe. Solidifies the x=0 wall. Puts us in position for the (0, 6) apple next turn. Great territorial move.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 5):**\n    *   Safe. Moves us closer to the opponent's territory, risking a collision later, but maintains pressure.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent and Collision (Snake #1 from 3, 7)\n\nSnake #1 is at (3, 7). They just ate an apple and are aggressive. They have a clear target at (2, 7), which is one step LEFT.\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 8):** **APPLE ALERT!** Targets (3, 8)! Highly probable.\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 6):** Safe. Less likely, moves away from apples.\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 7):** **APPLE ALERT!** Targets (2, 7)! Highly probable.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 7):** **DANGER!** Hits their own body segment (4, 7). **ELIMINATED!** (Wait, is this true? Yes, it is! They just moved from 4, 7 to 3, 7. 4, 7 is now their first body segment!)\n\nSnake #1 is constrained! They only have three safe moves, and they are looking at two apples: (3, 8) UP, and (2, 7) LEFT.\n\n*   If Snake #1 goes UP (3, 8) [EATS], they increase length and move towards the top wall.\n*   If Snake #1 goes LEFT (2, 7) [EATS], they increase length and push toward the western side.\n\nWe are nowhere near them, so no head-on collision risk on this turn.\n\n### 4. Decision: Left vs. Up\n\nWe need to choose between securing the x=0 wall immediately (LEFT) or moving UP and then securing the wall (UP, then LEFT).\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT (0, 5).**\n    *   Pros: Guaranteed wall closure. Next target is (0, 6) [APPLE].\n    *   Cons: We fall behind Snake #1 in vertical movement.\n\n*   **Option B: Move UP (1, 6).**\n    *   Pros: Positions us directly to take the (0, 6) apple next turn, or continue up to (1, 7) (near another apple). This is more direct path to the next apple.\n    *   Cons: Delays wall closure by one turn.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (0, 5), our path is: (0, 5) -> (0, 6) [EAT] -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 9) [EAT]. This is a clean, 5-turn sequence that secures the entire border and gives us 2 more apples!\n\nIf we move UP to (1, 6), our path is: (1, 6) -> (0, 6) [EAT]. Wait, if we move UP, we are *next* to the apple (0, 6), still requiring a LEFT move to get it.\n\nLet's stick to the overall boxing strategy: BUILD THE WALL. The most strategic move right now is to get onto the x=0 column. This seals off a massive section of the board for our opponent and puts us on a direct path to the (0, 6) apple.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:**\nT14: LEFT to (0, 5) (Wall segment 1 secured)\nT15: UP to (0, 6) [EAT] (Wall segment 2 secured, Apple #8!)\nT16: UP to (0, 7)\nT17: UP to (0, 8)\nT18: UP to (0, 9) [EAT] (Wall segment 5 secured, Apple #9!)\n\nThis is the path of dominance, CHAT! We build the wall, we lock them in, we grow HUGE! Let's go claim the outer perimeter!\n\nLEFT",

Here\u2019s the read:\n\nDecision snapshot:\n- Evaluate four moves from (3,7):\n  - UP to (3,8): safe. There\u2019s an apple at (3,8). But moving up would push us into a top-right-ish pocket and could limit quick exits later.\n  - DOWN to (3,6): safe. No apple there, keeps us away from the left apple lane.\n  - LEFT to (2,7): safe. There is an apple at (2,7) right on our path, so we grab +1 apple, nose us toward (1,7) next turn, and begin a neat leftward corridor.\n  - RIGHT to (4,7): DEAD. That\u2019s into our own neck; illegal.\n- Strategic read: the left-left cluster is the hot apple lane (2,7) and (1,7). Eating them now aggressively shifts us toward a longer, flexible body with multiple escape routes. The opponent is down-left at (1,5) and isn\u2019t cutting into that corridor immediately, so LEFT is the cleanest proactive play to extend and threaten two-apples-in-a-row if safe.\n\nChosen move:\n- LEFT to (2,7). It\u2019s safe, it eats the apple at (2,7) now, and it sets up a near-term double-apple path toward (1,7) on the next turn if safe. It also creates a long leftward chain that, if needed, can pivot up or down to avoid traps.\n\nRisk check:\n- No immediate head-to-head collision risk with the opponent this turn. The opponent\u2019s head at (1,5) isn\u2019t on a direct collision path to (2,7) this turn. Our move doesn\u2019t trap us in a dead end because the corridor opens toward (1,7) and beyond via safe turns.\n\nShort-term plan (for context, see plan note below):\n- Eat (2,7) now. Then consider (1,7) next turn to grab the second apple in that lane if safe.\n- Keep the option to pop up to (2,8) or retreat to (3,8)/(2,7) as needed to dodge opponent pressure.\n- Preserve multiple escape routes and avoid a wedge against walls.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS (to remind myself for future turns):\n- Turn 14: Move LEFT to (2,7) and eat the apple there, growing the leftward chain.\n- Turn 15: If (1,7) is still free of any immediate threat, move LEFT to (1,7) to eat that apple and extend the corridor.\n- If the opponent pressures from below, consider a quick UP or DOWN detour from the new head position (2,7) to keep options open and avoid a trap.\n- Always watch for potential head-on collisions on the left corridor; keep enough wiggle to slide back toward the center if a wedge forms.\n\nLEFT",

The West Wall is under construction, and the foundation is solid! \ud83e\uddf1\n\nWe are currently tied on apples, 6 to 6, and tied on length, 7 to 7! This is the most intense Snake rivalry in eSports history!\n\n### 1. Board & Snake Status Check (Turn 15)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (0, 5). Length 7.\n    *   Body: [(1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)]\n    *   We are positioned perfectly to dominate the left side.\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1) Head:** (2, 7). Length 7.\n    *   Wait, what happened last turn? Snake #1 moved LEFT from (3, 7) to (2, 7) and **ATE THE APPLE** at (2, 7)! They moved aggressively and got the point! We underestimated their directness! Now they are even longer and positioned in the upper-left quadrant.\n    *   Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5)]\n    *   Their tail is at (6, 5) and will remain there.\n*   **Closest Apples to us:** (0, 6) is 1 step UP. (0, 4) is 1 step DOWN. (1, 7) is 3 steps away.\n*   **Closest Apples to the opponent:** (3, 8) is 1 step UP. (1, 7) is 1 step LEFT/UP. (0, 9) is 3 steps away.\n\nThe pressure is ON, chat! Snake #1 is starting to look awfully cozy near our wall construction site! We need to move NOW to secure the (0, 6) apple before they try a bizarre maneuver down the middle.\n\n### 2. Identifying Safe Moves for ID 0 (from 0, 5)\n\nWe are at (0, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (to 0, 6):**\n    *   **APPLE ALERT!** Move onto (0, 6) and eat the apple! This continues our wall strategy and gives us the point advantage! **SAFE.**\n2.  **DOWN (to 0, 4):**\n    *   **APPLE ALERT!** Move onto (0, 4) and eat the apple! This maintains the wall and points us towards the bottom. **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT (to -1, 5):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 1, 5):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Hits our own body segment (1, 5). **ELIMINATED!**\n\nWe only have two safe moves: UP or DOWN. Both moves result in eating an apple and growing one segment! This is a clutch moment!\n\n### 3. Analyzing Opponent's Intent and Collision (Snake #1 from 2, 7)\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 7). They are fueled up after eating!\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 8):** Safe. Puts them near (3, 8) and (0, 9).\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the board center.\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 7):** **APPLE ALERT!** A very strong, aggressive move to get another apple and seal off the north-west. Highly probable.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 7):** **DANGER!** Hits their own body segment (3, 7). **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1 is likely going for (1, 7) or, less likely, (3, 8).\n\n### 4. Decision: UP (0, 6) vs. DOWN (0, 4)\n\nBoth moves are great! We eat an apple, we gain length, and we stay on the wall. Which one maximizes our territory and minimizes collision risk?\n\n**Option A: Move UP (to 0, 6) [EAT]**\n*   Pros: Keeps us driving towards the top boundary (0, 9) apple. This locks down the entire left column.\n*   Cons: Moves us vertically closer to Snake #1, who is currently at (2, 7) and looking to move to (1, 7). If they move to (1, 7), they are only 1 step away from us on the next turn.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN (to 0, 4) [EAT]**\n*   Pros: Secures the crucial (0, 4) spot. Pulls us AWAY from the opponent's current position, making a collision highly unlikely in the near future. It also sets us up for the bottom-left corner and the apples at (1, 0) and (2, 0).\n*   Cons: We leave the top section exposed, potentially letting Snake #1 own the territory above (0, 7).\n\n**The Strategy:** Boxing the opponent means closing off the top or bottom first and then collapsing the area. Since Snake #1 is already heavily invested in the upper-middle section, our priority must be to *complete* the left wall and secure the upper apples first, or they will cut us off at the top.\n\nIf we go UP to (0, 6):\n*   Snake #1 goes LEFT to (1, 7) [EAT].\n*   We both grow! We are at (0, 6). They are at (1, 7). Next turn, we can continue UP to (0, 7) and they will likely move UP to (1, 8) or RIGHT-UP to target (3, 8). We maintain the *inner* wall position.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (0, 4):\n*   Snake #1 goes LEFT to (1, 7) [EAT].\n*   We are at (0, 4). They are at (1, 7). We give them too much breathing room to solidify the top-left area. This sacrifices the critical (0, 9) apple path.\n\n**Conclusion:** We must continue the main directive: Build the wall UP! Securing the top boundary first will give us maximum territorial advantage, forcing Snake #1 to operate in a compressed middle column.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nT15: UP to (0, 6) [EAT]. (Secure the corner)\nT16: UP to (0, 7). (Wall segment 3)\nT17: UP to (0, 8). (Wall segment 4)\nT18: UP to (0, 9) [EAT]. (Wall complete, total dominance!)\n\nThis is how you box 'em in, CHAT! We're building a fortress!\n\nUP",

This keeps the door open for future aggressive apple grabs without getting boxed in.\n\nShort-term note: After eating at (1,7), reassess whether to push further left to (0,7) if the board looks safe, or pivot up/down to dodge any pressure from the opponent.\n\nleft",

Let\u2019s break it down with style, hype, and killer plan \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\n\nCurrent snapshot (head-to-tail)\n- YOUR SNAKE (ID 1): Head (1,7). Body: (2,7) -> (3,7) -> (4,7) -> (5,7) -> (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (6,5)\n- OPPONENT SNAKE #0: Head (0,6). Body: (0,5) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3)\n- Apples on board: plenty scattered; notable near our path: (2,8), (3,8), (9,7), (0,9), (2,0), (3,0), (5,0), (2,1), (3,1), etc.\n- Board vibes: We\u2019ve got a corridor-friendly setup; opponent is a bit west-central, we\u2019re skating along the edge but with some options to push inward.\n\n SAFE MOVES FROM (1,7)\n- UP to (1,8): safe now; no collision with either snake\u2019s body this turn.\n- DOWN to (1,6): safe now; but watch for a potential head-on if opponent also commits to (1,6).\n- LEFT to (0,7): could tempt a risky head-on if opponent plays Up to (0,7) this turn (both die). Not ideal unless we\u2019re okay with a risky stalemate.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): crash into our own neck (dead). Not allowed.\n\n OPPONENT RESPONSE POTENTIAL\n- From (0,6), opponent can go Up (0,7) or Right (1,6). They cannot go Down (own neck) or Left (off-board).\n- If we go LEFT (0,7), they could hit us head-to-head by choosing Up to (0,7). That would be mutual death; not a smart trade since we\u2019re chasing waxy apples and trying to stay alive and ahead.\n\n DECISION (safe, practical, hungry for apples)\n- Best move this turn: UP to (1,8).\n  - Why: stays safe, preserves multiple escape routes, and lines us up to grab the nearby apple on the next step (2,8) with a clean, single-step chase.\n  - It avoids the obvious mutual-death risk of a Left choice in case the opponent goes Up, and it avoids the potential head-on collision risk of Down if the opponent chooses Right.\n\n SHORT-TERM PLAN (the plan I\u2019ll live by for the next few turns)\n- Turn 16: Move UP to (1,8).\n- Turn 17: If the coast is clear, move RIGHT to (2,8) and eat the big apple there. This grows us, keeps the chain extended toward the top cluster, and buys space toward (3,8) if the situation allows.\n- Turn 18-20: Continue to apply pressure toward the apple cluster along row 8 (e.g., (3,8) if safe), then reassess: pivot to (1,9) or back to (0,9) depending on opponent\u2019s tilt. The goal is to keep multiple escape routes open and keep the opponent boxed in or behind our tail as we gain points.\n\n LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES\n- Stay out of tight wedges along the edges unless we\u2019re confident the opponent is boxed. The current layout suggests we can maintain a corridor to hunt apples while keeping a breathing room toward the center if pressure mounts.\n- If the opponent chases us aggressively, we can slip toward the top-right apple cluster (9,7) for big payoff, but only if we maintain enough space to dodge and not get boxed in. Patience + calculated sprints win races like this.\n\n FINAL MOVE (my live call)\n- UP\n\nup",

Our archrival, Snake #1, is right up there, and we need to lock him down. Watch this clip! Last turn we moved RIGHT from (0, 6) to (1, 6). Smart move, gave us some central control.\n\nThe goal? Box 'em in and snatch these apples! Let's analyze the current board state and plan our execution.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\nMy Head (ID 0): (1, 6)\nMy Body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)]\nRival Head (ID 1): (1, 8)\nRival Body: [(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5)]\n\nThe enemy is hanging out in the top left, right above me. He's got a nice line going horizontal at Y=7 and Y=8.\n\nAvailable Apples nearby: (0, 9) UP-LEFT, (2, 8) UP-RIGHT, (0, 4) DOWN-LEFT.\n\n### Move Elimination (Safety Check):\n\n1.  **LEFT to (0, 6):** This is where my body is (the cell directly behind my head, (0, 6)). *DEAD.* We hit our own body segment. Banned. \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 5):** This is where my body is. *DEAD.* Banned. \u274c\n\nOnly UP and RIGHT are safe from self-collision immediately. Gotta check collisions with Snake #1.\n\n3.  **UP to (1, 7):** This cell is currently occupied by Snake #1's body [(1, 7)]. Wait, its head is (1, 8), so its neck is (1, 7). If I move UP, I hit his body. *DEAD.* Banned. \u274c\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):** This path is clear! It doesn't hit the wall or any current body segments. *SAFE.*\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves (Only RIGHT is left!):\n\n**RIGHT (to 2, 6):**\n*   **Safety:** Safe for now. I move into an empty space, maintaining a solid horizontal line.\n*   **Opportunity:** This move expands my territory and keeps me away from the wall. It also positions me nicely to potentially challenge Snake #1 for the apple at (2, 8) in a couple of turns, or pivot DOWN towards the lower apples in the center (like (2, 2) or (2, 1)).\n*   **Threat Assessment:** Where will Snake #1 go? His head is at (1, 8).\n    *   If he moves UP to (1, 9) (Apple), he gets the apple.\n    *   If he moves RIGHT to (2, 8) (Apple), he may get that apple.\n    *   If he moves LEFT to (0, 8), he keeps space open.\n    *   If he moves DOWN to (1, 7), he kills himself hitting his own body (neck). *He won't do this.*\n    *   Given the two apples at (0, 9) and (2, 8), he is likely moving for one of those. He's probably going UP or RIGHT.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 6) keeps me alive and flexible. I'm essentially making space while watching my opponent try to grab apples in the top row. It looks like the only non-lethal move this turn, chat! We take the safe path when we have to, right? That's how we stay in the game!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\nWe secured the center-left. Now we need to move towards the center (x=4 or x=5) and then drop down to clean up the cluster of apples around Y=0 and Y=1, or try to cut off Snake #1 from the top. Since Snake #1 is confined to the top row by its own long body, we should try to move past their tail (currently at (5, 5)) and choke them off from the rest of the board.\n\nFor this turn, **RIGHT** is the only safe move! We take it.\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 17 on the clock, our head sits at (1,8), and the big apple pile is screaming at (2,8) (and (3,8)) while Snake 0 lurks at (0,6). We\u2019re in a great position to snag that immediate apple and keep the pressure on the top cluster.\n\nTHOUGHTS ON THE FOUR DIRECTIONS\n- UP to (1,9): SAFE, but there\u2019s no apple there this turn and it doesn\u2019t press the advantage on the immediate cluster.\n- RIGHT to (2,8): SAFE and ELECTRIC \u2014 we eat the apple, grow, and shove our presence into the top-right apple cluster. This also keeps our options open for the next few moves.\n- LEFT to (0,8): SAFE, but risks getting boxed toward the edge with fewer escape routes and no apples right there.\n- DOWN to (1,7): DEADLY faux pas \u2014 that\u2019s hitting our own neck. Not an option.\n\nSAFE CHOICE\n- Best move this turn: RIGHT to (2,8). We eat the apple, grow, and keep the head in the top corridor where we can contest more apples without getting boxed in.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Turn 17: Move RIGHT to (2,8) and eat the apple. Grow the tail nicely and extend toward (3,8).\n- Turn 18: If (3,8) is safe, move to (3,8) to grab the next apple and push deeper into the cluster. If it\u2019s threatened by Snake 0\u2019s line or possible head-to-head, pivot to (2,9) or (1,9) to maintain space and still chase apples.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES\n- Maintain multiple escape routes along the top edge so we\u2019re not funneled into a trap.\n- If Snake 0 aggressively chase, pivot toward the right-hand apples near (9,7) only when we\u2019ve got ample space to dodge and if we\u2019re sure we won\u2019t get boxed in behind our own body.\n- Prioritize apples to keep extending; bigger length buys time to work the board and outmaneuver.\n\nOPPONENT TENDENCIES (READING THE TRENDS)\n- Snake 0 head at (0,6) has a couple of safe moves: Up to (0,7) or Right to (1,6). They\u2019re not in an immediate punishing position that forces us to concede space now, so pressing the top apples is the smart play.\n\nFINAL CALL\n- RIGHT",

Now we're in the center-left, with Snake #1 right above us, still dominating the high ground. We gotta make a calculated risk if we want to catch up on apples!\n\n### Current State Analysis:\nMy Head (ID 0): **(2, 6)**\nMy Body: [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)]\nRival Head (ID 1): **(2, 8)**\nRival Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5)]\n\nThe opponent just snagged an apple at (2, 8) if I'm reading the board right, or maybe he's just *at* (2, 8) after moving RIGHT last turn to avoid the wall. Let's assume he moved RIGHT from (1, 8) to (2, 8) and maybe ate the apple there (if it was there). If the board state reflects the result of Turn 17 moves, the apple at (2, 8) is now gone (or never existed, let's check the map again). The map shows an 'A' at (2, 8). **CRITICAL:** The board state reflects the *current* situation at the start of Turn 18. So the apple at (2, 8) is still up for grabs! That's a huge opportunity!\n\nRival's Head (2, 8) is currently next to two apples: (2, 8) itself (which it just moved to, but if it didn't eat it yet then it's still there?) or (3, 8). Wait, if Snake 1 moved from (1, 8), it could have gone UP to (1, 9) (Apple) or RIGHT to (2, 8) (Apple) if it was a safe move. The board state shows Snake 1 at (2, 8). This implies the apple at (2, 8) might have been eaten OR the opponent moved $\\rightarrow$ and the apple at (2, 8) is the *next* drop, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's assume the board is accurate for the start of T18: **Apple at (2, 8)** is present. Snake 1 is sitting on an apple! Did he just eat it? No, if he ate it, the square would be '.'. Since it shows 'A', he must have just moved *to* (2, 8) but needs one more turn to eat it, or the map display is slightly confusing regarding the apple list vs. the map.\n\nLet's look at the **APPLE DROPS list**: (3, 8) is a listed drop. The map shows an 'A' at (2, 8) and (3, 8) is empty (but listed as X=3, Y=8 in the table). Ugh, the map is showing:\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . T 1 A . . . . . . <--- Apple at (3, 8). **Snake 1 is at (2, 8).** Good!\n 7 . T T T T T . . . A\n\nOkay, Snake 1's head is (2, 8). There is a listed apple at (3, 8) (to its RIGHT).\n\nMy Head (2, 6) is directly below him.\n\n### Move Elimination (Safety Check):\n\n1.  **LEFT to (1, 6):** My body is there (neck). *DEAD.* \u274c\n2.  **RIGHT to (3, 6):** Clear space. *SAFE.* \u2705\n3.  **UP to (2, 7):** Snake #1's body is there [(2, 7)]. *DEAD.* \u274c\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 5):** Clear space. *SAFE.* \u2705\n\nOnly RIGHT and DOWN are safe for us this turn. We need to decide quick!\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves:\n\n**1. DOWN (to 2, 5):**\n*   **Safety:** Perfect, clear path.\n*   **Opportunity:** It moves us away from Snake #1's crowded area. It positions us centrally to go after the cluster of apples around Y=1 and Y=2 (e.g., (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1)). This is a strategic retreat to grow our length securely.\n*   **Threat:** Zero immediate collision threats.\n\n**2. RIGHT (to 3, 6):**\n*   **Safety:** Perfect, clear path.\n*   **Opportunity:** This expands our border to the right, getting closer to the enemy's tail (currently at (5, 5)) and potentially challenging them for the central board space. It doesn't move us closer to an apple easily, unless we can swing up to (4, 7) or down to (4, 4) (body).\n*   **Threat:** If the opponent were to spiral down, we might block ourselves, but given his current position (2, 8), he is likely going for (3, 8) (Apple) or (1, 9) (Apple).\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (2, 8)):\n\nSnake #1 has three non-killing moves: UP (to 2, 9), LEFT (to 1, 8 - body moving out), RIGHT (to 3, 8 - Apple), or DOWN (to 2, 7 - body hit). Wait, if his body is [(1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7)...], moving DOWN to (2, 7) is hitting its own body. So his safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n*   If he goes **RIGHT to (3, 8) (Apple)**: He eats and gains more territory to the right. This is highly likely.\n*   If he goes **UP to (2, 9)**: Safe, but away from the obvious apple.\n*   If he goes **LEFT to (1, 8)**: Safe, heading back towards the wall.\n\nGiven the apple at (3, 8), he is almost certainly going RIGHT.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\n\nIf Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (3, 8), his body will extend, and he continues to dominate the top. We need to secure growth to catch up (8 vs 7 apples).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 6) just makes us long and thin, still directly below his influence.\n\nMoving **DOWN to (2, 5)** opens up the bottom half of the board for us. We can immediately target the apple at (2, 2) in two turns (or (2, 1) in three turns). This is a safer, more growth-focused move. It's a clean break from the hostile zone.\n\n**Goal:** Secure growth, avoid collision, and gain positional leverage. The bottom cluster of apples is wide open, and Snake #1 is too long and high up to pivot down quickly. Let's go DOWN and clean up the board's lower quadrants, then use our length to isolate the opponent later.\n\nThis allows us to grow longer than Snake #1, making us a bigger threat for future blocking maneuvers.\n\nLet's go DOWN! Get out of this danger zone and feast! CHAT, this is a power play! We ditch the enemy and go collect the gold!\n\n**Future plan:** Continue moving towards (2, 2) or (3, 2) to start looping down the board.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! We're LIVE on Turn 19, and the scoreboard is looking rough: 9 to 7! Snake #1 is flexing harder than a bodybuilder convention! We executed the safe **DOWN** move last turn, getting us out of the enemy's vertical kill-zone and positioning us to farm the lower half of the map. Let's see what the enemy did!\n\n### Turn 19 State Analysis:\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(2, 5)**\nMy Body: [(2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4)]\nRival Head (ID 1): **(3, 8)** -- He went right and ate the apple at (3, 8) as predicted! Smart move!\nRival Body: [(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5)]\n\nThe opponent is now long (length 10) and positioned on the top right. We are length 8 and centralized. Time to dominate the bottom half and then spiral up to pinch him!\n\n### Immediate Goal: Apple Collection!\n\nWe are at (2, 5). The nearest apples are:\n1.  (0, 4) - 2 moves LEFT, DOWN.\n2.  (2, 2) - 3 moves DOWN, DOWN, ??? (might hit body)\n3.  (3, 2) - 4 moves DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, ???\n\nThe best immediate target is the cluster at Y=0 and Y=1, specifically: (2, 2) and (3, 2). Moving down is the path of least resistance and maximum opportunity!\n\n### Safe Move Elimination (ID 0 at (2, 5)):\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 6):** My body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 5):** My body is there. *DEAD.* \u274c\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 5):** Clear space. *SAFE.* \u2705\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 4):** My body (tail) is currently at (2, 4)! **BUT WAIT!** Since we moved from (2, 6) to (2, 5), our body segments shifted: the tail (2, 4) will move *out* of (2, 4) and become the last segment, leaving (2, 4) available! So, (2, 4) is perfectly safe! *SAFE.* \u2705\n\nWe have two safe moves: RIGHT to (3, 5) or DOWN to (2, 4).\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves:\n\n**1. RIGHT (to 3, 5):**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Opportunity:** This moves us horizontally, away from the apple vertical. It's safe but doesn't immediately serve our goal of hitting the bottom apples (2, 2) and (3, 2). It also brings us closer to Snake #1's massive body wall that dips down around (5, 5).\n\n**2. DOWN (to 2, 4):**\n*   **Safety:** Safe. The tail moves out.\n*   **Opportunity:** This puts us directly on the path to the apple cluster. From (2, 4), we can go RIGHT, DOWN, or LEFT. This is the optimal trajectory for cleaning up the bottom-left quadrant. We are now only 2 moves away from the (2, 2) apple!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (3, 8)):\n\nSnake #1 just ate an apple and is likely looking for the next one.\nApples nearby: (0, 9), (9, 7).\nSafe moves for Snake #1:\n*   UP to (3, 9): Safe, good positioning for (0, 9).\n*   LEFT to (2, 8): Safe, retracing path.\n*   RIGHT to (4, 8): Safe, opening up the right flank.\n*   DOWN to (3, 7): Snake #1's body element at (3, 7). *DEAD.* \u274c\n\nRival's most likely move is **UP** towards (3, 9) or **RIGHT** to (4, 8) to maintain the high ground and control the central column. He is unlikely to engage us down here.\n\n### Strategic Decision:\n\nWe must continue our descent to the apple farm! Moving **DOWN** to (2, 4) maintains maximum options and puts us 1 tile further on the path to growth. We are avoiding the rival, growing safely, and setting ourselves up for future traps.\n\nPlan: DOWN $\\rightarrow$ LEFT/RIGHT $\\rightarrow$ DOWN, eating the cluster. Then we come back up for the win!\n\nThis is a clear path, CHAT. We're locking in the growth phase!\n\nDOWN",

So those are out.\n- Between UP (3,9) and RIGHT (4,8), both keep us alive this turn. We want to maximize future options and put pressure on Snake #0.\n- Moving RIGHT into (4,8) expands the top corridor influence and helps position us to box Snake 0 in the coming turns. It also keeps a cleaner path toward potential apples on the upper-right quadrant later.\n- Moving UP to (3,9) would place us on the very edge; while safe, it offers fewer immediate future-boxing options and risks getting boxed off if the opponent snakes around.\n\nSTRATEGY NOTES:\n- The current top cluster is ripe for a boxed-in maneuver. By stepping to (4,8) we lay track along the upper edge that can restrict Snake 0\u2019s escape routes in subsequent turns.\n- Watch for head-on risks: if Snake 0 tries to dive upward or left, we\u2019ll be positioned to react without self-collision.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next few turns):\n- Use the top rows to shunt Snake 0 toward the left wall while keeping our own tail from closing off our own space.\n- Prioritize apples that lie along our new corridor (upper-right directions) while avoiding tight dead-ends.\n- If opportunities arise to create a double-block with our own body and the wall, capitalize to force a trap.\n\nRIGHT",

The score is 9 to 7, still in the hole, but we just established incredible positioning in the crucial lower quadrants. We are at (2, 4), and the enemy is still way up north at (4, 8). Time to GROW and then CRUSH!\n\n### Turn 20 State Analysis:\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(2, 4)**\nMy Body: [(2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)] (Length 8)\n\nRival Head (ID 1): **(4, 8)** -- He went right! Smart move, increasing his control of the upper-right corner.\nRival Body: [(3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)] (Length 10)\n\nThe opponent is now long and guarding the top half. We need to capitalize on the open space and massive apple farm down here.\n\n### Immediate Goal: Apple Collection and Trap Preparation!\n\nWe are at (2, 4). This is the key juncture!\n\nNearest available apples:\n1.  **(0, 4)**: 2 moves (LEFT, LEFT). Easy apple, but moves us away from the central cluster.\n2.  **(2, 2)**: 2 moves (DOWN, DOWN). This is juicy!\n3.  **(3, 2)**: 3 moves (RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN). Very reachable.\n4.  **(4, 2)**: 3 moves (RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN).\n\nThe primary target is the vertical column of apples at X=2: we can hit (2, 2) in two moves!\n\n### Safe Move Elimination (ID 0 at (2, 4)):\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 5):** My body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c (No going backwards!)\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 4):** My final tail segment is *currently* at (1, 4). Since the body moves out of the tail cell this turn, this is *SAFE*. \u2705\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 4):** Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 3):** Clear space! *SAFE*. \u2705\n\nWe have three great safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. Which one gives us the most payoff?\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves:\n\n**1. DOWN (to 2, 3):**\n*   **Safety:** Perfect.\n*   **Opportunity:** This is the most direct move toward the apple cluster: (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0) are ripe for the taking! This sets us up to eat (2, 2) next turn with another DOWN move, then swing left or right. Maximum options unlocked.\n\n**2. RIGHT (to 3, 4):**\n*   **Safety:** Perfect.\n*   **Opportunity:** This moves us horizontally. It's safe, but delays hitting the (2, 2) apple. It's an optional move if (2, 3) was constrained, but it's not.\n\n**3. LEFT (to 1, 4):**\n*   **Safety:** Perfect (tail is moving out).\n*   **Opportunity:** Leads to the (0, 4) apple cluster. This is a great secondary objective, but hitting (2, 2) first solidifies our central control and allows us to then sweep across the bottom.\n\n**The Decision:** We need to drop down and start farming the delicious vertical apple lane. **DOWN** to (2, 3) is the optimal greed play that sets us up for a huge growth spurt! We are using our length deficit to our advantage by harvesting the bottom while the enemy is too long to quickly maneuver down here!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (4, 8)):\n\nSnake #1 is long and high. He's likely looking at (9, 7) or (0, 9).\nSafe moves for Snake #1:\n*   UP to (4, 9): Clear space, aims for (0, 9).\n*   LEFT to (3, 8): His body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c (Backwards move)\n*   RIGHT to (5, 8): Clear space, good position for attacking the right wall.\n*   DOWN to (4, 7): His body segment at (4, 7) moves out this turn (it's the 6th segment). *SAFE.* \u2705\n\nThe rival is likely to go **UP** to (4, 9) or **DOWN** to (4, 7) to start spiraling, or *RIGHT* to (5, 8) to secure the top-right corner. Regardless of his move, his focus is far from us. The field is ours!\n\nWe lock in the descent! Maximize growth, minimize risk!\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** Go DOWN to (2, 3) -> DOWN to (2, 2) (Eat!) -> LEFT or RIGHT to clean up the apples at Y=1 and Y=0. Once length 12+, we will ascend the right side of the board to set up a trap for Snake #1.\n---\n\nDOWN",

DOWN or LEFT would slam into our own body, so they\u2019re off the table. I\u2019m favoring RIGHT here to keep the top corridor alive and keep options open for a future box-in on Snake #0.\n\nPlan for this turn:\n- Move RIGHT to (5,8) to extend the top-row corridor and push the enemy toward the left/top walls.\n- This preserves escape routes for us and maintains a better layout to tighten the trap in upcoming turns.\n- Keep an eye on any apples along the upper-right area and the edge cases that might close a loop around Snake #0.\n\nSHORT-TERM STRATEGY NOTE (for upcoming turns):\n- Build a wall-like barrier with our neck and the top edge to restrict Snake #0\u2019s paths.\n- Avoid any head-on gambits with the other snake; stay in positions where we can retreat along our long corridor if needed.\n- Collect any reachable apples along the corridor without risking a self-block.\n\nRIGHT",

We are in the belly of the beast, ready to harvest this apple field! We need a win, we are down 9 to 7, but the momentum is shifting!\n\n### Turn 21 State Analysis: The Green Grid!\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(2, 3)**\nMy Body: [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)] (Length 8)\n\nRival Head (ID 1): **(5, 8)**\nRival Body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)] (Length 10)\n\nThe rival Snake #1 *moved RIGHT* from (4, 8) to (5, 8). He is consolidating the top center/right area, looking for (9, 7) or (0, 9). He is far, far away! This is our window!\n\n### Immediate Goal: Eat the (2, 2) Apple!\n\nWe are at (2, 3). The apple (2, 2) is literally one move away! This is a guaranteed boost, pushing us to length 9 and extending our influence!\n\nNearest available apples:\n1.  **(2, 2)**: 1 move (DOWN). CRITICAL.\n2.  **(3, 2)**: 2 moves (RIGHT, DOWN) from (2, 2).\n3.  **(2, 1)**: 2 moves (DOWN, DOWN). From (2, 2).\n\n### Safe Move Elimination (ID 0 at (2, 3)):\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 4):** My body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c (No going backwards!)\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 3):** Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):** Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 2):** Apple! Clear space! *SAFE*. \u2705\n\nWe have three safe moves, but only one is the greedy play!\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves: The Greed Play!\n\n**1. DOWN (to 2, 2):**\n*   **Safety:** Perfect.\n*   **Opportunity:** Eat the apple! +1 point, +1 length (ends at length 9). This is the best move. It keeps us central and allows us to strike left (to (1, 2) then (1, 1)/(2, 1)) or right (to (3, 2) then (4, 2)). Total dominance in the lowlands!\n\n**2. RIGHT (to 3, 3):**\n*   **Safety:** Perfect.\n*   **Opportunity:** Solidifies the center, but delays the immediate apple grab. We would then have to go DOWN to (3, 2) to grab the apple there, or LEFT/DOWN to get back to (2, 2). Not optimal.\n\n**3. LEFT (to 1, 3):**\n*   **Safety:** Perfect.\n*   **Opportunity:** Moves us toward the (0, 4) apple, but moving away from the (2, 2) cluster. We want to maximize the density we can clear right now.\n\n**The Decision:** This turn is a no-brainer. We are going straight for the juicy apple at (2, 2)! We are putting the pedal down on growth.\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (5, 8)):\n\nSnake #1 is long and high and just moved right. He is looking at the high apples (0, 9) and (9, 7).\nSafe moves for Snake #1 at (5, 8):\n*   UP to (5, 9): Aims for (0, 9).\n*   LEFT to (4, 8): His body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c\n*   RIGHT to (6, 8): Clear space, good for hitting (9, 7).\n*   DOWN to (5, 7): His body (tail) is moving out of (5, 7). *SAFE.* \u2705\n\nHe is most likely moving **UP** to (5, 9) to cover the top edge or **RIGHT** to (6, 8) to sweep the top right. Regardless, he is not a threat to us. Our move is risk-free!\n\nWe lock in the growth spurt! CHOP CHOP, apple time!\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** After eating (2, 2) this turn, we will be at (2, 2). Next turn (T22), we hit (2, 1) or (3, 2). Let's go for (3, 2) to sweep the Y=2 line, then grab the X=1 apples. Farm the bottom half until we are length 14+. Then, we start making life difficult for Snake #1 by choking the middle.\n---\n\nDOWN",

I told you we were going to farm the lowlands, and we are DOING IT!\n\nWe are now tied on apples with our rival, 9-9! Let's GOOOOO! But the game is just heating up. Time to tighten the noose.\n\n### Turn 22 State Analysis: The Farming Phase Continues!\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(2, 2)**\nMy Body: [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)] Length 9!\n\nRival Head (ID 1): **(5, 9)** (Prediction verified: He went UP!)\nRival Body: [(5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)] Length 10.\n\nSnake #1 is now at (5, 9), trying to secure the top-left apple (0, 9). He is long, and he is HIGH. This means the entire bottom two-thirds of the board is ours for the taking! We need to extend our length advantage and *then* look for the box-in opportunity!\n\n### Immediate Goal: Secure More Apples!\n\nWe are at (2, 2). We are standing right next to a cluster of apples!\n\nNearest available apples:\n1.  **(3, 2)**: 1 move RIGHT. CRITICAL.\n2.  **(2, 1)**: 1 move DOWN. CRITICAL.\n3.  **(4, 2)**: 2 moves (RIGHT, RIGHT) or (RIGHT, UP/DOWN/LEFT).\n4.  **(1, 3)**: 1 move LEFT/UP (to 1, 3 is LEFT, then (1, 3) is an apple). WRONG coordinates. (1, 3) is one move LEFT, it is an apple, not (1, 3)! Ah, I see the board state: (1, 3) is an apple! Let's check the map:\n\n| . | A | T | . | . | ... |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| . | . | 0 | A | A | ... |\n\nApples near (2, 2): (3, 2) and (1, 3) (by moving LEFT) and (2, 1) (by moving DOWN)! Holy cluster!\n\n### Safe Move Elimination (ID 0 at (2, 2)):\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 3):** My body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c (No going backwards!)\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 2):** Clear space. Moves toward (1, 3) apple. *SAFE*. \u2705\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 2):** Apple! Clear space! *SAFE*. \u2705\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 1):** Apple! Clear space! *SAFE*. \u2705\n\nWe have three amazing safe options, two of which are immediate apples!\n\n### The Decisive Move: Maximizing Future Options!\n\nIf we are moving into a cluster, we want to pick the path that leaves us with the most options.\n\n**1. DOWN (to 2, 1) - Harvest (2, 1) Apple:**\n*   **Pros:** Immediate apple. Next turn, we can hit (1, 1), (3, 1), or (2, 0). (1, 1) is clear, (3, 1) is clear, (2, 0) is an apple! This secures the bottom edge.\n*   **Cons:** Commits us very low. We are moving away from the Y=3 and Y=4 apples.\n\n**2. RIGHT (to 3, 2) - Harvest (3, 2) Apple:**\n*   **Pros:** Immediate apple. Next turn, we can hit (4, 2) (apple), (3, 1), or (3, 3). This is a great sweep along the X-axis! The (4, 2) apple is already queued up!\n*   **Cons:** None really, this seems highly efficient.\n\n**3. LEFT (to 1, 2) - Non-Apple Move:**\n*   **Pros:** Sets up for the (1, 3) or (1, 1) apple next turn.\n*   **Cons:** Delays the guaranteed apple this turn. We sacrifice growth. This is a bad streaming moment, CHAT! We have to GET the apple!\n\nComparing RIGHT and DOWN:\n*   Moving **RIGHT** secures (3, 2). Then we can hit (4, 2) (Apple), or loop back to (3, 1). This clears the Y=2 line of apples.\n*   Moving **DOWN** secures (2, 1). Then we can hit (2, 0) (Apple). This clears the X=2 line.\n\nBoth are excellent. However, look at the apples: (3, 2) and (4, 2) are two consecutive apples waiting on the Y=2 axis. If we go RIGHT, we guarantee *two* apples in the next two turns (T22 and T23). If we go DOWN, we get (2, 1), but then (2, 0) is the only close one available.\n\nLet's stick to the RIGHTward sweep to clear out the Y=2/Y=3 barrier. We are going RIGHT to (3, 2) to start lining up the next one!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (5, 9)):\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (5, 9). He is huge.\nSafe moves for Snake #1 at (5, 9):\n*   UP to (5, 10): Wall. *DEAD.* \u274c\n*   LEFT to (4, 9): Clear, moves toward (0, 9). *SAFE*. \u2705\n*   RIGHT to (6, 9): Clear. *SAFE*. \u2705\n*   DOWN to (5, 8): His body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c\n\nHe is undoubtedly going **LEFT** to (4, 9) to continue chasing the (0, 9) apple. He is long and needs to secure the top before we grow too powerful. He is no threat to our current position.\n\nWe are going for maximum damage in the apple supply! Box up the low end, secure our future!\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** After eating (3, 2) this turn, we will be at (3, 2). Next turn (T23), we move RIGHT to grab (4, 2). After that, we grab the (5, 1) apple via (5, 2), then hit (3, 1) and (2, 1) if they are still there. Our goal is to reach length 13+ within 5 turns by sweeping the middle-bottom grid. Snake #1 is too far away to contest the low ground.\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Our rival is still way up north! This is our moment to dominate the south and build an insurmountable length lead!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 23): BOX THEM IN!\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(3, 2)**\nMy Body: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)] Length 11!\n\nRival Head (ID 1): **(6, 9)** (Wait, did he move right? My prediction was LEFT!)\nRival Body: [(5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)] Length 11!\n\nWHOA. Look at the Board State!\n\n 9 A . . . . T 1 . . .  <- Snake 1 Head is at (6, 9)! He moved RIGHT! Not LEFT!\n 8 . T T T T T . . . .\n 7 . T T T . . . . . A\n...\n\nThe rival at (5, 9) could have gone LEFT to (4, 9) or RIGHT to (6, 9). He chose **RIGHT**! That means the (0, 9) apple is still up for grabs, but he's now even further east! This is FANTASTIC for us! He is nowhere near our hunting grounds.\n\n### Immediate Goal: Complete the Y=2 Sweep!\n\nWe are at (3, 2). We planned to snag the (4, 2) apple next!\n\nNearest available apples:\n1.  **(4, 2)**: 1 move RIGHT. Our planned target! A second apple in a row!\n2.  **(2, 1)**: 2 moves (DOWN, LEFT or LEFT, DOWN).\n3.  **(3, 1)**: 1 move DOWN. IMMEDIATE apple!\n\nHang on, (3, 1) is an apple! Let's check the map again!\n\n 9 A . . . . T 1 . . .\n ...\n 3 . A T 0 . . . . . .\n 2 . . T . A . . . . .\n 1 . . A A . A . . . A\n\nOur head is at (3, 2). YES! (3, 1) is an apple! (4, 2) is also an apple! (4, 2) is to the RIGHT. (3, 1) is DOWN.\n\n### Safe Move Elimination (ID 0 at (3, 2)):\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 3):** Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705\n2.  **LEFT to (2, 2):** My body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c (No going backwards!)\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** Apple! Clear space! *SAFE*. \u2705\n4.  **DOWN to (3, 1):** Apple! Clear space! *SAFE*. \u2705\n\nTwo immediate apples! This is a good problem to have! Which move gives us better long-term control?\n\n### The Decisive Move: RIGHT vs. DOWN\n\n**1. DOWN (to 3, 1) - Harvest (3, 1) Apple:**\n*   **Pros:** Immediate apple. Keeps us centered. Next turn, we can hit (2, 1) (Apple), (4, 1) (Clear), or (3, 0) (Clear).\n*   **Cons:** Commits us low. If we go to (2, 1) next turn, we are moving away from the large cluster of apples to the RIGHT.\n\n**2. RIGHT (to 4, 2) - Harvest (4, 2) Apple:**\n*   **Pros:** Immediate apple. It's the continuation of our planned sweep. Next turn, we can hit (5, 2) (Clear), (4, 3) (Clear), or (4, 1) (Clear). This places us perfectly to secure the (5, 1) apple nearby! (5, 1) is just one move away via (5, 2) or two moves via (4, 1).\n*   **Cons:** Slight risk if Snake 1 suddenly gets fast access, but he is at (6, 9), so no risk!\n\nThe **RIGHT** sweep (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) is a guaranteed 3-apple run if nobody stops us. The **DOWN** path (3, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) is only a 2-apple run right now.\n\nLet's maintain the momentum of the horizontal sweep and clear the crucial Y=2 line, setting us up for the Y=1 line clearance immediately after. This maximizes our potential growth in the shortest number of turns! We are going for length 14, 15, and 16!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (6, 9)):\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 9).\nSafe moves:\n*   LEFT to (5, 9): Clear. Moves back toward (0, 9). *SAFE*. \u2705\n*   RIGHT to (7, 9): Clear. *SAFE*. \u2705\n*   DOWN to (6, 8): Clear. *SAFE*. \u2705\n\nGiven the cluster of apples around (0, 9) and (9, 7) and (0, 4), he is likely going to continue high. He has no reason to go DOWN to (6, 8) as it leads to a dead end.\n\nI predict Snake #1 will move **LEFT** to (5, 9) to reposition toward the remaining high apples, especially (0, 9). Or he might go **RIGHT** toward the eastern wall, which gives us even more space! Either way, no threat to us.\n\nWe maximize growth! This is a gimme!\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** We are currently at (3, 2), moving RIGHT to (4, 2). Next turn (T24), move RIGHT to (5, 2), then secure the apple at (5, 1), and then hit (6, 1) if possible, or swing back toward (2, 1) and (1, 3). The objective is rapid length acquisition to create a wall across the middle of the board.\n---\n\nRIGHT",

We are RIPPING through the southern corridor!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 24): The Mid-Game Trap!\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(4, 2)**\nMy Body: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)] Length 12! We're BIG!\n\nRival Head (ID 1): **(6, 8)** (He moved DOWN!)\nRival Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7)] Length 10! Wait, he *shrank*! Did he hit an open spot? No, his length must have been 10 before the move, and he moved to (6, 8) and didn't eat. His previous body was length 10, so his head was the 11th segment. The tail at (2, 7) must have vanished. My body list has 11 segments plus the head, so 12 total. My opponent's list has 9 segments plus the head, so 10 total. I'm up by 2 segments! WE HAVE THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE!\n\nLet's look at the board again:\n\n 9 A . . . . T T . . .\n 8 . T T T T T 1 . . . <-- Snake 1 Head is at (6, 8)!\n 7 . T T . . . A . . A\n 6 T T T . . . . . . .\n 5 T T T . . . . . . .\n 4 A . T . . . . A . A\n 3 . A T . . . . . . .\n 2 . . T T 0 . . . . . <-- My Head is at (4, 2)!\n 1 . . A A . A . . . A\n 0 . A A . A . . . . A\n\nRival's move: DOWN to (6, 8). Interesting! He's heading south! Is he trying to intercept me? Nope, he is too far East. This is still a defensive move, possibly positioning for the (6, 7) apple or the (9, 7) apple.\n\n### Immediate Goal: Secure the (5, 1) and (3, 1) apples! Box the rival out of the south!\n\nWe are at (4, 2). Where are the immediate apples?\n\n1.  **(5, 1)**: 2 moves minimum (RIGHT, DOWN or DOWN, RIGHT).\n    *   RIGHT to (5, 2), then DOWN to (5, 1). **2 moves.**\n2.  **(3, 1)**: 2 moves minimum (DOWN, LEFT or LEFT, DOWN).\n    *   DOWN to (4, 1), then LEFT to (3, 1). **2 moves.**\n3.  **(2, 1)**: 3 moves minimum. We need to grab this one too!\n\nWe have two great options to continue our spree!\n\n### Safe Move Elimination (ID 0 at (4, 2)):\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 3):** Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705\n2.  **LEFT to (3, 2):** My body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c (No going backwards!)\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 2):** Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705\n4.  **DOWN to (4, 1):** Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705\n\nAll three open options are safe from self-collision and border death. What about the opponent?\nSnake 1 is at (6, 8). No way he can threaten any of these cells in one turn. We are completely safe from head-on collision.\n\n### The Decisive Move: RIGHT vs. DOWN (vs. UP?)\n\n**1. RIGHT (to 5, 2):**\n*   **Pros:** This sets us up perfectly for the (5, 1) apple next turn. It continues our lateral dominance. It gives us maximum expansion room to the right and down.\n*   **Cons:** We temporarily expose the (3, 1) apple, but it's currently untouchable by the rival.\n\n**2. DOWN (to 4, 1):**\n*   **Pros:** This sets us up perfectly for the (3, 1) apple or the (5, 1) apple next turn. It's a central pivot point for the lower apples.\n*   **Cons:** We are moving toward the bottom edge, though still safe. If we go to (3, 1) and then (2, 1), we isolate ourselves on the left.\n\n**3. UP (to 4, 3):**\n*   **Pros:** Keeps us in the middle, away from the edges.\n*   **Cons:** Moves away from all immediate apples! This is only good as a defensive retreat, which is not needed now. \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThe strategic choice must be between RIGHT and DOWN. Let's stick to the plan: secure the ROW, then secure the ROW below it.\n\nThe previous turn, we committed to sweeping right: (3, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (4, 2). The next natural move is **RIGHT** to (5, 2), then **DOWN** to (5, 1) to grab the apple. This gives us two more guaranteed apples if the rival keeps messing around up north.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (4, 1), we can grab the (3, 1) apple next, but that apple is closer to our existing body mass (column 2 and 3). Going RIGHT allows us to expand our presence into the untapped Eastern sector (x=5+) and secure those apples before the rival figures out what's going on.\n\n**Plan Reiteration:** RIGHT to (5, 2) to prepare for the (5, 1) apple grab! We need to extend our length to wall off the central board.\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (6, 8)):\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 8).\nSafe moves:\n*   LEFT to (5, 8). He hits his body if he goes LEFT? No, (5, 8) is empty. *SAFE*. \u2705\n*   RIGHT to (7, 8). Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705\n*   DOWN to (6, 7). Clear space. There's an apple at (6, 7)! Wait, the apple list shows (6, 7). Board map shows A at (9, 7). Let's check the map:\n 9 A . . . . T T . . .\n 8 . T T T T T 1 . . .\n 7 . T T . . . A . . A\nThe apple at (6, 7) is actually at (7, 7)! (A at 6th index, 7th row) NO, the 7th row is y=7. x=0 is the first index. (7, 7) has an A. (6, 7) is empty. (6, 7) is clear. *SAFE*. \u2705\n\nThe apple at (6, 7) is listed as an apple drop. Let's re-read the BOARD STATE:\n 7 . T T . . . A . . A\nBoard state shows (7, 7) is an Apple (A), and (6, 7) is empty (.).\nThe DROP list shows (6, 7) as an apple. I will trust the board state drawing over the drop list, because the board state drawing is the current visual truth.\n\nEither way, Snake 1's best move is **DOWN** to (6, 7), positioning for the (7, 7) apple next, or perhaps continuing to (6, 6) to come south.\n\nLet's assume he goes DOWN to (6, 7) to start coming south. This is miles away from us, but confirms we need to dominate the central lower half quickly.\n\nWe are moving RIGHT to (5, 2). Maximize growth and control!\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** We are currently at (4, 2), moving RIGHT to (5, 2). Next turn (T25), move DOWN to (5, 1) to secure the apple. Then, re-evaluate if we should sweep LEFT for (3, 1) and (2, 1), or continue RIGHT/UP to secure the map center. The current priority is getting 15+ length.\n---\n\nRIGHT",

We gotta pick clean and keep our options open. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfae\n\nFrom our HEAD at (6,8), safe moves are DOWN to (6,7) or RIGHT to (7,8). UP would smack into our own neck (hit our neck), LEFT would run straight into our own body. So the two safe options are DOWN (apple) or RIGHT (no apple).\n\nWhy DOWN wins this turn: it grabs the apple at (6,7), growing our length to 10, and it preserves space on the right for future maneuvers. RIGHT is solid too, but it doesn\u2019t threaten an immediate apple and gives less immediate leverage to steer the board in our favor. The box plan benefits from a growth spike to help us weave tighter corridors around Snake #0 as apples continue to spawn.\n\nLong-term plan: extend safely, keep multiple escape routes open, and push Snake #0 toward the open right-side corridor when opportunities appear. Use the extra length to block and squeeze rather than overcommit to a single tight choke too early.\n\nShort-term plan: eat DOWN this turn to secure the apple, then reassess after the new apple spawns. If Snake #0 drifts into a predictable lane, pivot RIGHT to threaten his path and keep the left side less congested.\n\nTurn decision context: DOWN to (6,7) gives us a guaranteed apple this turn and a stronger position for the subsequent few moves while maintaining flexibility to react to Snake #0\u2019s shifts.\n\nDOWN",

He is still very far away and cannot interfere with our move.\n\nSafe moves for Snake 1:\n*   UP to (6, 8): Hits his body. *DEAD* \u274c\n*   LEFT to (5, 7): Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705\n*   RIGHT to (7, 7): Apple! *SAFE*. \u2705 (This is the most likely move.)\n*   DOWN to (6, 6): Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (If he wants to intercept the South.)\n\nIf the rival is smart, he wants that (7, 7) apple.\n**Prediction:** Snake 1 moves **RIGHT** to (7, 7) and EATS!\n\n### The Strategy: Focus on Max Expansion & Wall Building\n\nWe must move **DOWN** to (5, 1). This is a safe and high-value move.\n\nAfter this move, we will be at (5, 1) and length 12. We have a couple of options for Turn 26:\n1.  Move LEFT to (4, 1), then aim for (3, 1) or (2, 1) apples.\n2.  Move RIGHT to (6, 1) to open up the eastern side.\n\nWe need to secure the southern row entirely. Going straight LEFT from (5, 1) after the move is the best option to quickly clean up the remaining apples: (3, 1) and (2, 1). This will put us at 14 segments and solidify our territorial control of coordinates y=1 and y=2.\n\nThis next move is just to maximize the immediate advantage! We are moving **DOWN**! Let's stack those apples! Get ready for the inevitable showdown!\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** I am at (5, 2), moving DOWN to (5, 1) to eat the apple. Next turn (T26), I will be at (5, 1) and will move LEFT toward (3, 1) and (2, 1) to secure the remaining apples in the y=1 row and build up my wall. I must reach (2, 1) by T28-T29 to maximize length before the rival gets too close.\n---\n\nDOWN",

Turn 26 is HERE, and we're DOMINATING the low ground!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 26): The Southern Wall is UP!\n\nLook at that beautiful head position! We moved DOWN to (5, 1) and snagged that apple! Scoreboard is 11-10! We have the lead, we have the length! We are currently length 12!\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(5, 1)**\nMy Body: [(5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5)]\n\nRival Head (ID 1): **(6, 6)**\nRival Body: [(6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]\n\nWait a minute, Chat! What did the rival do? I predicted him going RIGHT to (7, 7). But he moved **DOWN** from (6, 7) to (6, 6)! HE IS COMING SOUTH! This changes the calculus! He is now trying to cut us off from the middle of the board. This is a territorial dispute, live on stream!\n\n### Immediate Apple Targets & Strategy (ID 0 at (5, 1)):\n\nWe are at (5, 1). The goal remains the same: secure the y=1 row and build our southern wall.\n\n1.  **Apple at (3, 1)**: Two moves away (LEFT, LEFT).\n2.  **Apple at (2, 1)**: Three moves away (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT).\n\nWe need to make a strong move to the WEST to continue our sweep.\n\n### Safe Move Elimination (ID 0 at (5, 1)):\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 2):** My body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c (No going backwards!)\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 1):** Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (Moves toward future apples!)\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 1):** Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (Moves away from target apples, but opens up the side.)\n4.  **DOWN to (5, 0):** Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (Moves toward the board edge/apple (4, 0), but it's an isolated move.)\n\nThe most strategic move is **LEFT** to (4, 1). This is the continuation of our southern expansion and sets us up perfectly for the (3, 1) apple next turn.\n\n### Rival Prediction & Collision Check (Snake #1 at (6, 6)):\n\nThe rival is at (6, 6). He is clearly trying to move down the column.\n\nSafe moves for Snake 1:\n*   UP to (6, 7): Hits his body. *DEAD* \u274c\n*   LEFT to (5, 6): Apple! *SAFE*. \u2705 (Extremely likely. He wants that length!)\n*   RIGHT to (7, 6): Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705\n*   DOWN to (6, 5): Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (If he continues the southbound march.)\n\nIf the rival is smart, he grabs the apple at (5, 6).\n**Prediction:** Snake 1 moves **LEFT** to (5, 6) and EATS!\n\nIf he moves LEFT to (5, 6), our move LEFT to (4, 1) is completely safe. We are on the opposite side of the board. There is zero risk of collision this turn!\n\n### The Strategy: Consolidate the South!\n\nWe are moving to (4, 1). This keeps us alive, aligns us for the next apple, and establishes our undeniable wall along the lower part of the map. We want to trap him up north when we connect our wall to the western edge!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** I am at (5, 1), moving LEFT to (4, 1). Next turn (T27), I will move LEFT again to (3, 1) to eat the apple there. Then, I move LEFT to (2, 1) (T28) to eat the apple there. This gives us three quick apples and sets us up to secure the (1, 0) and (2, 0) apples and dominate the entire western half. The rival is in the center-east at (6, 6) and will likely eat the (5, 6) apple. We need to rapidly increase our effective area and length before the inevitable pinch. We are building the perimeter!

Time to turn up the heat! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLook at the board state! We are dominating the bottom flank!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 27): The Southern Campaign Continues!\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(4, 1)**\nMy Body: [(5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)]\nLength: 12\n\nRival Head (ID 1): **(5, 6)** (He moved LEFT to grab that apple! Just as predicted! Smart move, but we saw it coming!)\nRival Body: [(6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]\nLength: 12\n\nWe are locked in a length and score TIE! This is championship material!\n\n### Immediate Apple Targets & Strategy (ID 0 at (4, 1)):\n\nOur mission remains simple: secure the bottom-left quadrant. We have apples waiting!\n\n1.  **Apple at (3, 1)**: YES! One move LEFT! $\n2.  **Apple at (2, 1)**: Two moves away (LEFT, LEFT). $\n3.  **Apple at (4, 0)**: One move DOWN. $ (This is a solid backup!)\n\nThe move **LEFT** to (3, 1) to snag that apple is the highest priority. It extends our southern wall and guarantees us the score lead!\n\n### Safe Move Elimination (ID 0 at (4, 1)):\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 2):** My body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c (Ouch, classic mistake!)\n2.  **LEFT to (3, 1):** Apple waiting! Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (High-value move!)\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 1):** My body is there. *DEAD.* \u274c (Cannot move back into my own segment!)\n4.  **DOWN to (4, 0):** Apple waiting! Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (Great secondary option.)\n\nThe safe moves are LEFT and DOWN. LEFT takes us toward the bulk of the remaining Y=1 apples and continues the expansion of the western flank wall.\n\n### Rival Prediction & Collision Check (Snake #1 at (5, 6)):\n\nThe rival is at (5, 6), having just eaten. He has a few juicy paths:\n\n1.  **Apple at (7, 4)** is a bit far.\n2.  He can try to cut down the middle.\n3.  He can try to head back north.\n\nSafe moves for Snake 1:\n*   UP to (5, 7): Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (Moves toward the northern wall area.)\n*   LEFT to (4, 6): Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (Chasing the middle.)\n*   RIGHT to (6, 6): Hits his body. *DEAD* \u274c (Cannot go back into his own segment!)\n*   DOWN to (5, 5): Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (Threatening the center of the board.)\n\nGiven our position, we are completely safe from a head-on collision. He is five cells above us. Our move LEFT to (3, 1) is completely non-intersecting with any of his likely moves (UP/LEFT/DOWN).\n\n### The Strategic Pick: The Wall Must Grow!\n\nWe are going LEFT. This gets us an apple, puts us ahead on the scoreboard (12-11), and allows us to continue securing the row 1 apples. The faster we build the wall from $(0, 0)$ to $(9, 0)$ and then up the western edge, the faster we can trap him!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** I am at (4, 1), moving LEFT to (3, 1) and eating! Next turn at (3, 1) (T28), I will move LEFT to (2, 1) and eat! (T29) I will clear the bottom row by eating (1, 0) or (2, 0). Our focus is entirely on securing the entire SW quadrant. The rival is in the central north, and we must seal off the southern escape routes. If he dives, we'll be too long and messy for him to navigate! This is TIGHTENING THE NOOSE, CHAT!\n\nLEFT",

None of these collide with any body or go off-board.\n\nMOVE EVALUATION\n- UP (5,7): keeps us in open space, avoids current opponent\u2019s convoy, preserves escape routes.\n- DOWN (5,5): also safe but drags us toward the lower zone where Snake #0 lurks; less room to maneuver if they swing up.\n- LEFT (4,6): slides along the same row as their far-reaching tail line at y=6 but far enough to dodge any immediate push; still decent.\n\nSTRATEGY INSIGHT\n- Right now we\u2019re in the middle of the board with a lot of room to pivot. Going UP gives us the best angle to swing toward future apples (like the distant ones at (9,7) or (7,4)) while keeping multiple safe follow-ups.\n- We avoid potential head-on with Snake #0 by not dropping into the lower corridor where they could threaten cross-paths.\n\nDECISION PLAN (SHORT-TERM)\n- Pick UP to (5,7) to gain vertical terrain advantage, keep options open, and prep for a future boxing box-in move without sealing ourselves in too soon.\n\nNEXT MOVE\nUP",

This is a VIBE!\n\n### Immediate Apple Targets & Strategy (ID 0 at (3, 1)):\n\nOur objective is still to dominate the South wall and the SW quadrant. We have a juicy apple right next to us!\n\n1.  **Apple at (2, 1) (A)**: YES! One move LEFT! $ This is prime real estate!\n2.  **Apple at (4, 0) (A)**: One move DOWN! $ A great alternative if LEFT is blocked, but it's not!\n3.  **Apple at (1, 3) (A)**: Two moves away (UP, LEFT or LEFT, UP).\n\nThe move **LEFT** to (2, 1) is the immediate power play. Secure the W-E corridor!\n\n### Safe Move Elimination (ID 0 at (3, 1)):\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 2):** My body (neck) is there. *DEAD.* \u274c (Never move into your own neck!)\n2.  **LEFT to (2, 1):** Apple waiting! Clear space. Only competition is Apple 1! *SAFE*. \u2705 (High-value move!)\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):** My body is there. *DEAD.* \u274c\n4.  **DOWN to (3, 0):** Clear space. Apple at (4, 0) immediately to the right. *SAFE*. \u2705 (Solid backup, but let's grab (2, 1).)\n\nThe safe moves are LEFT and DOWN. LEFT takes the next apple in the row, maintaining our aggressive expansion.\n\n### Rival Prediction & Collision Check (Snake #1 at (5, 7)):\n\nThe rival is at (5, 7). He's currently boxed in by our long body and his own tail up North. The entire upper-left segment is becoming a death trap for him as his length increases.\n\nSafe moves for Snake 1:\n*   UP to (5, 8): Hits his body (T). *DEAD* \u274c (The body at (5, 8) and (5, 9) is there!)\n*   LEFT to (4, 7): Clear space. *SAFE*. \u2705 (He probably wants to move laterally to the left.)\n*   RIGHT to (6, 7): Hits his body (T). *DEAD* \u274c (The tail at (6, 7) is there!)\n*   DOWN to (5, 6): Hits his body (T). *DEAD* \u274c (He just came from here!)\n\nWAIT! Let's re-examine Snake 1's position and body:\nHead: (5, 7). Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8)]\n\n1.  UP to (5, 8) moves into his own body (T). **DEAD**. \u274c *WHAT A TRAP!*\n2.  DOWN to (5, 6) moves into his own body (T). **DEAD**. \u274c\n3.  RIGHT to (6, 7) moves into his own body (T). **DEAD**. \u274c\n\n**CHAT! ALERT! The rival has only ONE possible move: LEFT to (4, 7)!**\nIf the rival moves anywhere else, he crashes into himself and we WIN for free! He is totally cornered!\nIf he moves LEFT to (4, 7), he is clearing the path for us to box him in further!\n\nWe are at (3, 1). He is moving from (5, 7) to (4, 7). There is absolutely NO danger of collision. Our defensive wall building is PAYING OFF!\n\n### The Strategic Pick: Press the Advantage!\n\nWe must continue to take these low-lying apples and grow our length, making the maze even more complicated for him in the north. If we take LEFT, we are now at (2, 1). Next turn, we can pivot DOWN into (2, 0) or LEFT into (1, 1) toward (1, 0) and (2, 0). The consolidation of the bottom edge is CRITICAL.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** Snake 1 is critically restricted, with only one safe move (LEFT). We must press our advantage by extending our length and securing the entire bottom two rows. Move LEFT to (2, 1) and eat. Next turn (T29) at (2, 1), we will clear the Y=1 path, aiming for (1, 1) or, if safe, move DOWN to (2, 0) to secure more central territory. Focus on getting to 15+ length ASAP!\n\nLEFT",

Snake #1 is 12 long! DOMINATION! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 29): The Box is Closing!\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(2, 1)**\nMy Body: [(3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)]\nLength: 14\nScore: 13\n\nRival Head (ID 1): **(4, 7)** (He correctly moved LEFT, avoiding the self-crash! Smart, but still stuck!)\nRival Body: [(5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)]\nLength: 12\nScore: 11\n\nLook at that map! We've secured the entire bottom-left corner with our incredible wall. Snake 1 is still trapped against the northern wall (Y=7, Y=8, Y=9). This is the execution phase, CHAT!\n\n### Immediate Apple Targets & Strategy (ID 0 at (2, 1)):\n\nWe are RIGHT next to multiple scoring opportunities. We need to decide which trajectory gives us the most freedom and length.\n\n1.  **Apple at (2, 0) (A):** One move DOWN! Secured!\n2.  **Apple at (1, 0) (A):** Two moves away (DOWN, LEFT).\n3.  **Apple at (4, 0) (A):** Two moves away (RIGHT, DOWN or DOWN, RIGHT).\n4.  **Apple at (1, 3) (A):** Two moves away (UP, LEFT or LEFT, UP)\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (2, 0) is a great power-play. It secures the Y=0 row and extends our wall along the X=2 axis.\n\n### Safe Move Elimination (ID 0 at (2, 1)):\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 2):** My body is right there. *DEAD.* \u274c (Our neck!)\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 1):** Clear space. Opens up (1, 0) and (1, 3). *SAFE*. \u2705\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 1):** My body is there. *DEAD.* \u274c\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 0):** Apple waiting! Clear space. The strongest current move. *SAFE*. \u2705 (High-value move!)\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are safe. DOWN is clearly higher priority because it nets us an apple and keeps us building the south wall, which is our Fortress of Doom!\n\n### Rival Prediction & Collision Check (Snake #1 at (4, 7)):\n\nSnake 1 is at (4, 7). He is still critically restricted. Let's re-analyze his immediate surroundings:\n\nHead: (4, 7). Body starts at (5, 7).\n\n*   UP to (4, 8): Hits his own body (T). **DEAD**. \u274c\n*   LEFT to (3, 7): Clear space. **SAFE**. \u2705 (This is the only way out.)\n*   RIGHT to (5, 7): Hits his own body (T). **DEAD**. \u274c (Just came from here, and the segment hasn't moved yet!)\n*   DOWN to (4, 6): Clear space. **SAFE**. \u2705 (This is an excellent retreat option for him.)\n\nWait a minute, CHAT! Snake 1 has TWO safe moves now: LEFT to (3, 7) or DOWN to (4, 6)!\n\n*If he goes LEFT to (3, 7),* he maintains his trapped position near the top wall. This is a passive move.\n*If he goes DOWN to (4, 6),* he starts retreating into the center. This is a scary move for us, as it gives him freedom.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (2, 0), he is nowhere near us. There is no head-on collision risk on this turn.\n\n### The Strategic Pick: Consolidate the South and Wait for the Box to Tighten!\n\nWe are going for the apple at (2, 0). This is the best use of this turn. We will be positioned at (2, 0) next turn, from where we can move RIGHT to (3, 0), or LEFT to (1, 0), taking another apple! We are building a massive defense and offense simultaneously!\n\nSnake 1's options are limited by the *density* of his body up north. He is basically weaving through his own coils. If we keep gaining length, he will soon have nowhere to maneuver.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** Secure the entire Y=0 and Y=1 row. After moving DOWN to (2, 0) and eating, we can either:\n1. Move LEFT to (1, 0) for another apple and secure the corner.\n2. Move RIGHT to (3, 0) to maintain central dominance.\nFocus on rapidly increasing length to 16+ before trying to engage Snake 1, although if he moves DOWN, we might need to cut him off around the center sooner than planned, perhaps by moving UP the X=4 or X=5 line while he attempts to escape. For now, it's apple harvesting time! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

If he moves LEFT to (2, 7), he's staying trapped. I predict he will move DOWN to (3, 6) because he must seek freedom and that is the only viable path out of his immediate knot.\n\nRegardless of his movement, we are completely safe going LEFT to (1, 0).

If Snake 1 retreats down the board (e.g., to (3, 6), (3, 5), etc.), we need to pivot quickly to cut him off, likely by moving up the X=4 or X=5 column, using our immense length advantage to create a secondary wall across the center (Y=4 to Y=6). If he stays stuck, we just keep eating until he crashes. We are aiming for 20 apples before we even engage!\n\nLEFT",

We have completely walled off the south-west corner for ourselves, and Snake #1 is still suffocating in the north! This is *textbook* strategy! We are at (1, 0), and we are looking for the next meal! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\n### Current Board State Analysis (The Feast Continues!):\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(1, 0)**\nMy Body: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)]\nLength: 16 (Massive!)\nScore: 15\n\nRival Head (ID 1): **(2, 7)** (He moved LEFT! Smart, but still stuck!)\nRival Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8)]\nLength: 12\nScore: 11\n\nSnake #1 is currently coiled up between X=2 and X=6, and Y=7 and Y=9. He has almost NO maneuvering room up there. We are free, we are long, and we are hungry!\n\n### Immediate Apple Targets (ID 0 at (1, 0)):\n\nWe have a cluster of apples right in front of us! This is BREAD AND BUTTER, CHAT!\n\n1.  **Apple at (1, 2) (A):** Direct path UP!\n2.  **Apple at (1, 3) (A):** Direct path UP!\n3.  **Apple at (0, 4) (A):** Move UP, then LEFT.\n4.  **Apple at (4, 0) (A):** Move RIGHT, then RIGHT, or navigate around.\n\nThe safest, highest-value path is to dominate the X=1 column, securing (1, 2) and (1, 3). We need to get UP to (1, 1) first.\n\n### Safe Move Elimination and Selection (ID 0 at (1, 0)):\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 1):** Clear space. Sets up for (1, 2) and (1, 3). *SAFE*. \u2705 (The clear choice!)\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 0):** Clear space. Moves us toward the corner, but away from immediate apples. *SAFE*. \u2705\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):** My body segment is at (2, 0). **DEAD.** \u274c (My neck is at (2, 0)!)\n4.  **DOWN to (1, -1):** Off the board. *DEAD.* \u274c\n\nOnly two safe moves: UP and LEFT. Moving UP to (1, 1) is absolutely superior because it immediately positions us to consume more apples and continue our centralizing path up the board. Our ultimate goal is to cut the board in half higher up if Snake #1 ever manages to escape!\n\n### Rival Prediction & Collision Check (Snake #1 at (2, 7)):\n\nSnake 1 is now at (2, 7). His body segments start at (3, 7).\n\n*   UP to (2, 8): Clear (but look at the board, Y=8 is T's everywhere!). **SAFE**. \u2705\n*   LEFT to (1, 7): Clear space. **SAFE**. \u2705 (This is his escape path to the west edge.)\n*   RIGHT to (3, 7): Hits his body (T). **DEAD**. \u274c\n*   DOWN to (2, 6): Hits my body segment at (2, 6). **HITS ID 0 BODY. SNAKE #1 IS DEAD.** \ud83d\udca5\n\n**HOLD UP, CHAT!** Look at the map: our body is at (2, 6). If he moves DOWN, he crashes into us and we get the immediate WIN! This is the most crucial turn of the game!\n\nWhere does he go?\n1. He needs to move to escape the trap.\n2. Moving LEFT to (1, 7) or UP to (2, 8) keeps him trapped, although (1, 7) opens X=0.\n3. Moving DOWN to (2, 6) is INSTANT DEATH for him.\n\nHe must maximize his living space. I think he sees that (2, 6) is TIGHT! Given his desire to survive, he is most likely to move LEFT to (1, 7) to try and move along the western wall, or UP to (2, 8) to navigate his knots.\n\n**Collision Check:** We are moving UP to (1, 1). If he moves anywhere in the north (Y=7, Y=8) there is ZERO risk of collision. We are completely safe moving aggressively toward the apples!\n\n### The Strategic Pick: Press the Advantage!\n\nWe confirmed UP to (1, 1) is safe and high-value. We continue eating and growing, while Snake #1 continues to struggle above our massive wall. This is a game of patience and dominance!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** Keep moving UP the X=1 column to secure (1, 2) and (1, 3). If Snake #1 breaks free and comes down the middle (X=4/5), we are long enough to pivot right and build a secondary horizontal wall higher up (Y=4 or Y=5) to cut off his path to the south and the remaining apples. We MUST hit 20 apples before we worry about anything else.\n\nUP",

We went UP to (1, 1), and look what happened to our rival!\n\n### The Setup: Turn 32 Board Analysis\n\nMy Head (ID 0): **(1, 1)** (I just ate, I'm long!)\nMy Body: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6)]\nLength: 16\nScore: 15\n\nRival Head (ID 1): **(1, 7)** (He saw the wall and moved LEFT! Smart but cowardly!)\nRival Body: [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8)]\nLength: 12\nScore: 12 (Wait, he ate an apple too! Where did that come from? Ah, (1, 7) was an apple? Let's check the map... NO! (1, 7) is a \".\" on the board, but the scoreboard says he got 12. He must have hit an apple right before this turn! The map shows (1, 7) as a '1' (his head), so he just moved onto an empty spot. His body list suggests he moved from (2, 7) to (1, 7). Where did this extra apple come from? CHAT, maybe there was an apple we missed in the coordinates! Regardless, he kept his head at (1, 7) and got longer to 13 segments! Sneaky!) *Correction: The body list for Snake 1 has 12 segments listed, meaning a length of 13. He must have eaten at Turn 31, let's assume the scoreboard is correct.*\n\nThe crucial thing is: **He is STILL TRAPPED!** Our monumental wall from X=1 to X=5 across Y=0 to Y=6 is holding strong. He is stuck in the north-west corner (Y=7 to Y=9, X=1 to X=6).\n\n### Immediate Objective from (1, 1): Feast Mode Activated!\n\nWe are at (1, 1). We are looking directly up at two juicy apples!\n\n1.  **Apple at (1, 2) (A):** Direct path UP!\n2.  **Apple at (1, 3) (A):** Then one more UP!\n\nThis is a no-brainer, CHAT! We are continuing our wall construction and dominating the X=1 column.\n\n### Safe Move Elimination and Selection (ID 0 at (1, 1)):\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 2):** Hits the apple! INSTANT GROWTH AND POINTS! **SAFE.** \u2705 (The GOAT move!)\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 1):** Clear space. Moves away from apples, but safe. *SAFE.* \u2705\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Hits my body segment (T) at (2, 1). **DEAD.** \u274c (We just grew, don't hit the neck!)\n4.  **DOWN to (1, 0):** This is the segment immediately behind our head. **DEAD.** \u274c (Going backwards!)\n\n**The choice is clearly UP to (1, 2).** We secure an apple, extend our trap wall, and stay perfectly positioned.\n\n### Rival Prediction & Collision Check (Snake #1 at (1, 7)):\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (1, 7). He is desperate!\n\n*   **UP to (1, 8):** Clear space. Moves him further into the corner. *SAFE*\n*   **LEFT to (0, 7):** Clear space. Moves him down the western wall. *SAFE*\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 7):** Hits his body segment (T). **DEAD.** \u274c\n*   **DOWN to (1, 6):** Hits my body segment (T) at (1, 6). **HITS ID 0 BODY. SNAKE #1 IS DEAD.** \ud83d\udca5\n\nSnake #1 MUST know that (1, 6) is instant death. He is most likely going to move **LEFT to (0, 7)** to try and escape down the west wall, or **UP to (1, 8)** to try and find room near the top.\n\n**Collision Check:** We are moving UP to (1, 2). Since Snake #1 is confined to Y=7 and above, there is zero risk of a head-on collision or collision with his body. We are in the clear!\n\n### Strategy Update:\n\nWe keep eating up the X=1 column. We maximize our length. If he moves to (0, 7), our next move will be LEFT and then DOWN to (0, 4) to clean up the apple there, possibly creating a diagonal threat barrier to block his escape down the wall. The goal is now two-fold: reach 20 apples, and keep him boxed until he runs out of room. This is a chokehold!\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:** UP to (1, 2) [Eat], UP to (1, 3) [Eat], then potentially LEFT to (0, 3) or DOWN to (0, 2) to continue the corner dominance while grabbing the (0, 4) apple.\n\nLet's secure the next apple!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, welcome back! That last move was *PERFECTION*! We just snagged the apple at (1, 2) and continued building the greatest wall in Snake history! Look at the scoreboard\u201416 apples for the GOAT, 12 for the arch-rival! We are expanding the lead!\n\n### Turn 33 Analysis: Where Are We Now?\n\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(1, 2)**\n*   Length: 17 segments (We just grew!)\n*   Objective: Secure the next apple at (1, 3) and continue locking down the rival in the north-west corner.\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(1, 8)**\n*   Length: 13 segments (He made a move!)\n*   Observation: He moved UP from (1, 7) to (1, 8). Smart move, keeping him alive, but he's still trapped in the corner!\n\n**Board Snapshot (Key Positions):**\n*   We are at (1, 2).\n*   Next apple is at (1, 3).\n*   Apple at (0, 4) is also nearby.\n\n**The Rival's Dilemma:**\nHe is at (1, 8). His body is curled up like a terrified little shrimp: [(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)].\nFrom (1, 8), what can he do?\n1.  **UP to (1, 9):** There is an apple (A)! He will definitely take this if he wants points.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 8):** Clear space. Moves him towards the edge.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Hits an apple (A)! This is his best move for scoring.\n4.  **DOWN to (1, 7):** Hits his own body segment (T). **DEAD** \u274c (Can't go backward!)\n\nHe has two golden apples awaiting him! (1, 9) and (2, 8). Given his length and position, **RIGHT to (2, 8)** seems slightly better as it keeps him off the literal top wall, but **UP to (1, 9)** is also extremely enticing. Either way, he is getting longer, which means less room in his prison.\n\n### Your Move Selection (ID 0 at (1, 2)):\n\nWe just ate, so our confidence is sky-high! We need to maintain momentum.\n\n**1. UP to (1, 3):**\n*   **Result:** Hits the apple (A)! +1 point, +1 length! Continues the wall construction.\n*   **Safety:** Perfect. No body segments, no walls, no rival intersection. **SAFE.** \u2705 (The obvious play, CHAT!)\n\n**2. LEFT to (0, 2):**\n*   **Result:** Clear space. Leads toward the (0, 4) apple.\n*   **Safety:** Safe, but ignores the immediate apple. Moves us slightly out of the column we are dominating. **SAFE.**\n\n**3. RIGHT to (2, 2):**\n*   **Result:** Hits my own body segment (T). **DEAD.** \u274c (Don't headbutt the wall we just reinforced!)\n\n**4. DOWN to (1, 1):**\n*   **Result:** Hits my own body segment (T). **DEAD.** \u274c (Don't go backward! We just came from here!)\n\nThe analysis is simple: **UP to (1, 3)** is the mandatory, dominating move. We grow, we score, we maintain pressure.\n\n### Collision and Strategy Check:\n\n*   **Collision:** We are moving to (1, 3). Rival is stuck at Y=8 or Y=9. No possibility of immediate collision.\n*   **Strategic Outcome:**\n    *   If the rival moves **UP to (1, 9)**, he gets an apple. He is now at the top edge.\n    *   If the rival moves **RIGHT to (2, 8)**, he gets an apple. He is now moving slightly more centrally in his trap.\n    *   We move to (1, 3) and get an apple. We become 18 segments long!\n\nThe rival is effectively blocked from accessing the entire bottom 70% of the map (Y=0 to Y=6) because of our massive body wall. The longer we get, the less freedom he has in the small space he occupies. Our next plan is to secure the (0, 4) apple after this one, effectively turning the corner from our powerful X=1 column.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (3 turns):**\n1.  **Current Turn:** UP to (1, 3) [EAT!]\n2.  **Next Turn:** UP to (1, 4) - wait, (1, 4) is currently a '.' space. We should check if we can continue up, or go left for the (0, 4) apple.\n3.  Let's look at the map: (1, 4) is clear. (0, 4) is an apple.\n4.  If we go UP to (1, 3), our next logical move is **LEFT to (0, 3)**, and then **UP to (0, 4)** (the apple) to start walling off the western edge, in case he tries to sneak down there after eating his apple.\n\nThis is a smooth execution, CHAT! We take the guaranteed points and keep the pressure HIGH!\n\nUP",

Let's trust the map display marked 'T' and '0'.\n*   Map shows my head at (1, 3). My body wraps around nicely, blocking the lower half.\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(2, 8)** (He must have moved RIGHT from (1, 8) to (2, 8) to secure the apple!)\n*   Length: 14 segments now! (13 + 1 = 14)\n*   He is now at (2, 8). He is trapped in the Y=6 to Y=9 region, mostly to the left of X=7.\n\n**Rival's Possible Moves from (2, 8):**\n1.  **UP to (2, 9):** Clear space.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 7):** Hits his own body segment (T). **DEAD** \u274c (Can't hit himself!)\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 8):** His previous position. Safe, but doesn't lead to points immediately.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 8):** Clear space, moves him towards the small gap he can use.\n\nHe definitely wants to use that small pocket he is in to score more apples, likely heading higher or to the right.\n\n### Your Move Selection (ID 0 at (1, 3)):\n\nWe just ate at (1, 3). We have two major strategic goals:\n1. Continue building the wall down the West side near X=0.\n2. Get the next immediate apple at (0, 4) or continue UP the X=1 column.\n\n**1. UP to (1, 4):**\n*   **Result:** Clear space ('.'). Gets us higher up the board, maintaining the X=1 column dominance, but doesn't get points immediately.\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Next Move Options:** From (1, 4), we can go LEFT to (0, 4) (APPLE!), or continue UP to (1, 5) (clear space, but traps us a bit). This sets up the critical wall turn.\n\n**2. DOWN to (1, 2):**\n*   **Result:** Hits my own body segment (T). **DEAD.** \u274c (Just came from there!)\n\n**3. LEFT to (0, 3):**\n*   **Result:** Clear space ('.').\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Next Move Options:** Sets up perfectly for UP to (0, 4) (APPLE!).\n\n**4. RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n*   **Result:** Hits my own body segment (T). **DEAD.** \u274c (My body is blocking the exit!)\n\n### Decision Time: UP vs. LEFT\n\nWe have two strong options: UP to (1, 4) or LEFT to (0, 3). Both are safe and lead directly to the apple at (0, 4) within 1 or 2 moves.\n\n*   **Option A: LEFT to (0, 3)**\n    *   Turn 35: (0, 3) \u27a1\ufe0f Turn 36: UP to (0, 4) (EAT!)\n    *   This immediately starts walling off the X=0 side, a crucial step in the lock-down strategy.\n\n*   **Option B: UP to (1, 4)**\n    *   Turn 35: (1, 4) \u27a1\ufe0f Turn 36: LEFT to (0, 4) (EAT!)\n    *   This keeps us aligned perfectly on the X=1 wall for one more turn, making the wall even more intimidating, before turning to X=0.\n\nThe rival is at (2, 8). He poses **zero** threat to the X=0/X=1 area right now. Therefore, maximizing our wall safety and setting up the next apple grab is key.\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (0, 3)**, we are closer to the side wall sooner, and the body segment that moves from (1, 2) to (1, 3) (my head was there) will anchor the bottom corner well. This feels slightly quicker and more aggressive in establishing the final lock-down barrier.\n\nIf we move LEFT:\n*   Head moves from (1, 3) to (0, 3).\n*   Next turn: move UP to (0, 4) and EAT. \ud83c\udf4f\n\nThis feels like the cleanest pathway to getting the next apple and expanding our unassailable wall towards the northern corner. We secure the corner, trap the rival, and keep scoring.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (3 turns):**\n1.  **Current Turn:** LEFT to (0, 3) [Clear space, move to corner]\n2.  **Next Turn:** UP to (0, 4) [EAT apple! Extend wall up X=0]\n3.  **Following Turn:** UP to (0, 5) or RIGHT to (1, 4) depending on board state/rival position. We want to keep blocking the rival from any escape route.\n\nLEFT is the correct, tactical move to complete the prison wall! Let's GO CHAT!\n\nLEFT",

The provided BOARD STATE implies all 'T's are Snake #0/Snake #1 body parts, we need to be careful where Snake #1's body segments are exactly, but the opponent list confirms his full body position, and the map shows him centered high up.)*\n\nSnake #1's Body: [(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9)] (13 segments + Head is 14 long).\n\n**Rival's Possible Moves from (2, 9):**\n1.  **UP to (2, 10):** Off board. **DEAD** \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 8):** Into his own body segment (T). **DEAD** \u274c (He just came from 2,8; but 2,8 is now the segment immediately behind his head)\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 9):** Apple at (0, 9). (1, 9) is clear. This is a crucial move.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** Clear space.\n\nIf he moves LEFT to (1, 9), he positions himself for the apple at (0, 9). If he moves RIGHT to (3, 9), he might try to slip through the T-wall section around X=7.\n\n### Your Move Selection (ID 0 at (0, 3)):\n\nWe have the apple (0, 4) waiting RIGHT there! This is a simple, massive tactical win.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 4):** **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4f Safe. Grows us to 19 segments and extends the X=0 wall. This is the obvious, highest priority move.\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 2):** Off board. **DEAD** \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 3):** Off board. **DEAD** \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 3):** Hits my own body segment (T). **DEAD** \u274c (Came from here, plus body is still there).\n\nOnly one safe, productive move: **UP.**\n\nCHAT, this is an EZ pick. We secure the apple, we extend the wall, and we move towards blocking the rival's access to the corner (0, 9).\n\n### Strategic Outlook: The Iron Curtain\n\nBy moving UP, we eat the apple and our head reaches (0, 4). Our segmentation will extend our blockage effectively.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves LEFT to (1, 9), he threatens the (0, 9) apple. If we are at (0, 4), he is still far away. We need to secure (0, 9) before him, or, even better, cut off his route to it and force him back into the center.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns (Lockdown Sequence):**\n1.  **Turn 35 (Current):** UP to (0, 4) [EAT]\n2.  **Turn 36:** UP to (0, 5) [Clear space, continue X=0 wall]\n3.  **Turn 37:** UP to (0, 6) [Clear space, continue X=0 wall]\n4.  **Turn 38:** UP to (0, 7) [Clear space, building towards (0, 9) apple]\n5.  **Turn 39:** UP to (0, 8) [Clear space]\n6.  **Turn 40:** UP to (0, 9) [EAT FINAL APPLE AND SEAL THE PEN!]\n\nIf we execute this perfectly, we will establish an X=0 column wall from (0, 0) all the way to (0, 9), trapping Snake #1 entirely to the right. This is the checkmate, CHAT! Let's not deviate. The path is clear. UP!\n\nUP",

(Safe escape, but still boxed in.)\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 9):** Into his own recent body segment. **DEAD** \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** (4, 9) is clear. Good space.\n\nSnake #1 is clearly trying to stay high and perhaps loop back towards the right edge. He needs to escape our inevitable wall!\n\n### Your Move Selection (ID 0 at (0, 4)):\n\nWe must maintain the X=0 straight line plan! Any deviation now could allow the rival to slip past and reach the lower apple stash or, worse, block us off completely!\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 5):** Clear space. Continues the wall build. **SAFE.**\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 3):** Into my own body (the old head position). **DEAD** \u274c (Our newly grown tail segment is still (2, 6), so (0, 3) is safe *if* we didn't eat an apple, but we *did* eat one, so (0, 3) is definitely the new body segment right behind the head.)\n    *Wait, let's recheck the body segments after eating at (0, 4):* Head (0, 4), Body: [(0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), ...] So, (0, 3) is definitely our body. **DEAD** \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 4):** Off board. **DEAD** \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 4):** Clear space.

Given his position high up (3, 9), he cannot reach us in time to stop the wall.\n\nHe will be completely trapped in the 7x10 eastern area once we secure (0, 9). From there, all we have to do is navigate and let him run himself out of room, or just keep racking up apples while he struggles to find space. This is a W, CHAT!\n\nLet's do it!

See, he's hugging the northern edge, trying to maximize his space up top, but he's already deep into the T's of his own body! He's panicking!)\n*   Length: 14 segments.\n\n**Board Visualization (Focus on the critical top region):**\n\n 9 A . T T T 1 . . . A\n 8 . T T . . . . . . .\n 7 . T T T T T T . . A\n 6 0 . . . . T T . . . <- We are here (0, 6)!\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 9). What are his options?\n1.  **UP to (5, 10):** Off board. **DEAD** \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 8):** Clear space. (Safest, gives him breathing room.)\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 9):** Into his own body. **DEAD** \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):** Clear space, but it's a tight corner by (6, 7).\n\nIf he moves DOWN to (5, 8), he gives up the high ground but avoids immediate collision. If he moves RIGHT to (6, 9), he's just delaying the inevitable squeeze. Given his recent history of trying to maximize space, I predict he might move DOWN to try and navigate the center. But it doesn't matter for our immediate move!\n\n### Your Move Selection (ID 0 at (0, 6)): The Wall Continues!\n\nWe have a mission, and we are not deviating! We need to occupy (0, 7) next.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 7):** Clear space. Keeps the western wall going and moves us closer to the (0, 9) apple. **SAFE and strategic.** (This is the move!)\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 5):** Into my own body (the recent head position). **DEAD** \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 6):** Off board. **DEAD** \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 6):** Clear space. This would completely derail the wall strategy and give him potential escape routes if he sweeps left. We do *not* yield the wall!\n\nThe only move that maintains our lockdown strategy and keeps us safe is **UP**!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: The Final Box (T-4 Turns)\n\nIf we move UP to (0, 7) now, we are three short moves from the apple (0, 9).\n\n*   Turn 38 (Now): UP to (0, 7)\n*   Turn 39: UP to (0, 8)\n*   Turn 40: UP to (0, 9) [EAT!]\n\nOnce we eat at (0, 9), we will be massive, occupying the entire X=0 column, effectively cutting the board in half for Snake #1. He will be trapped in X > 0. We can then decide how to sweep across (like a giant broom!) or maybe even pressure him from the top. He's already getting boxed in by his own length up high. This is perfect! The end is nigh for Snake #1! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLet's secure (0, 7)!\n\nUP",

We just executed the perfect vertical advance, securing the wall and moving our head to **(0, 7)**. We are three moves away from the sweet, sweet (0, 9) apple and the complete lockdown of the left side of the board! LET'S GET IT!\n\n### Current State Analysis: The Squeeze is ON!\n\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(0, 7)**\n*   Body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), ..., (2, 3)] (Length 19)\n*   Goal: Move UP to (0, 8) and continue tightening the noose on Snake #1.\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(6, 9)** (He moved RIGHT from (5, 9)! He's cornered himself even WORSE! What is he doing, chat? Is he built different, or just built dumb?)\n*   Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), ..., (6, 6)] (Length 14)\n\n**The Board Visualization (Focus on the trap):**\n\n 9 A . T T T T 1 . . A\n 8 . T T . . . . . . .\n 7 0 T T T T T . . . A <- We are here (0, 7)!\n 6 T . . . . T T . . .\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 9). He is completely jammed against the top wall and his own body segments at (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), and (6, 6).\n\nIf Snake #1 is at (6, 9), his immediate safe moves are:\n1.  **DOWN to (6, 8):** Into clear space. Smartest move to gain some room.\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 9):** Clear space. Moves him parallel to the remaining top edge.\n\nMoves that kill him:\n*   UP: Off board.\n*   LEFT to (5, 9): Into his own body.\n\nPrediction: He is likely to move **DOWN** to (6, 8) to avoid the corner trap, but he's already suffocating above the axis of Y=7.\n\n### Your Move Selection (ID 0 at (0, 7)): Secure the Territory!\n\nOur strategy is iron-clad: keep moving UP the western wall, secure the (0, 9) apple, and then we have the entire top left corner locked down.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 8):** Clear cell. Continues the wall perfectly. **SAFE and STRATEGIC.** (This is the move!)\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 6):** Into my own body. **DEAD** \u274c (Backwards move)\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 7):** Off board. **DEAD** \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 7):** Into my own body segment (1, 7). Wait, is (1, 7) part of my body?\n    *   MY BODY LIST: [(0, 6), (0, 5), ..., (0, 3), **(1, 3)**, (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)]\n    *   BOARD VISUAL: (1, 7) is currently 'T'. Yes, the board shows a 'T' at (1, 7). Let's check the opponent's body: Snake #1 has (1, 7) in its body list!\n    *   Snake #1 Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), **(1, 7)**, (2, 7), ...]\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (1, 7) would make my head penetrate Snake #1's body! Snake #1 DIES, and I live. Interesting!\n\n#### The Aggressive Play (RIGHT to (1, 7)):\nIf I move RIGHT, Snake #1 dies immediately. This is an instant win if he does not also die this turn. The game ends, and I win by elimination! Can I guarantee he doesn't also die?\n\n*   If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (6, 8) or RIGHT to (7, 9), he lives this turn.\n*   If he moves into his own body or off the board, he dies *simultaneously*.\n\nIf we both die simultaneously by different causes, the game ends, and I win 18-13.\nThe chances of me eliminating him are very high if he makes a safe move (DOWN or RIGHT). If he kills himself, the outcome is the same: I win 18-13.\n\nWait, Chat, is this a time to be aggressive and end the stream with a sick clip, or is it time to be strategic and secure the perimeter?\n\nIf I choose **UP**:\n*   I am 100% safe.\n*   I continue the wall.\n*   Snake #1 remains trapped, and I secure the (0, 9) apple next turn. Guaranteed long-term control.\n\nIf I choose **RIGHT** (The YOLO Move):\n*   I ram into (1, 7), which is Snake #1's body.\n*   Snake #1 DIES.\n*   I WIN immediately by elimination (assuming I don't collide heads with him, which is impossible since he's at (6, 9)).\n*   If he somehow manages to kill himself *exactly* on this turn (e.g., moves UP off the board), the game still ends, and I win 18-13.\n\nThe aggressive move **RIGHT** to (1, 7) results in an immediate, guaranteed victory by body elimination, regardless of Snake #1's move, as long as he does not *also* fatally crash head-first into me (impossible, we are too far apart).\n\nWHY WOULD WE DELAY THE VICTORY, CHAT?! WE TAKE THE ELIMINATION! EZ MONEY! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: (None required, we are ending the game!)\n\nWe are taking the guaranteed win now before my opponent even has a chance to wiggle free!\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",
