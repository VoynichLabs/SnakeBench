RIGHT: (4, 2) - Empty space, safe\n\nThreat Analysis:\n- Enemy at (7, 0) is moving left and could be a future threat\n- My own body at (3, 3) is directly up - must avoid moving UP\n- The enemy is currently moving horizontally and not directly toward me\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 2) would allow me to eat the apple at (2, 2)\n- Moving DOWN to (3, 1) would position me to potentially move right to (4, 1) or left to (2, 1)\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 2) would position me to potentially move down to (4, 1) or up to (4, 3) but (4, 3) is my own body\n\nApple Strategy:\n- The closest apple is at (2, 2) which I can eat by moving LEFT\n- Other nearby apples are at (1, 2) and (3, 0)\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 2) is the best choice as it allows me to eat an apple immediately\n\nFuture Considerations:\n- After moving left to (2, 2), I'll be able to eat the apple at (2, 2) and grow\n- This move keeps me away from the enemy and positions me well for future moves\n- The enemy is moving left toward the cluster of apples on the right side\n- I should try to secure apples on the left side to maintain my lead\n\nBest Move:\nMoving LEFT to (2, 2) is the best choice - it's safe, allows me to eat an apple, and keeps me away from the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

UP: (0, 4) - Empty space, safe\n2. DOWN: (0, 2) - Apple! Safe and I can eat it\n3. LEFT: (-1, 3) - Off the board! Would kill me\n4. RIGHT: (1, 3) - My own body! Would kill me (moving backwards)\n\nThreat Analysis:\n- Enemy at (7, 4) is moving left and could be a future threat\n- My own body at (1, 3) is directly right - must avoid moving RIGHT\n- The enemy is currently moving horizontally and not directly toward me\n- Moving DOWN to (0, 2) would allow me to eat the apple at (0, 2)\n- Moving UP to (0, 4) would position me to potentially move left to (0, 5) or right to (1, 4)\n\nApple Strategy:\n- The closest apples are at (0, 2) which I can eat by moving DOWN\n- Other nearby apples are at (0, 1), (1, 8), and (0, 7)\n- Moving DOWN to (0, 2) is the best choice as it allows me to eat an apple immediately and positions me well for future moves\n\nFuture Considerations:\n- After moving down to (0, 2), I'll be able to eat the apple at (0, 2) and grow\n- This move keeps me away from the enemy and positions me well for future moves\n- The enemy is moving left toward the cluster of apples on the right side\n- I should try to secure apples on the left side to maintain my lead\n\nBest Move:\nMoving DOWN to (0, 2) is the best choice - it's safe, allows me to eat an apple, and keeps me away from the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT: (2, 1) - Empty space, safe\n\nThreat Analysis:\n- Enemy at (6, 6) is moving left and could be a future threat\n- My own body at (1, 2) is directly up - must avoid moving UP\n- My own body at (0, 1) is directly left - must avoid moving LEFT\n- The enemy is currently moving horizontally and not directly toward me\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 0) would keep me safe but no apple\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 1) would keep me safe but no apple\n- Both DOWN and RIGHT are safe but neither gives immediate apple\n\nApple Strategy:\n- The closest apples are at (5, 1) and (2, 6) which are 4 moves away\n- Other nearby apples are at (0, 4), (1, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8)\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 1) positions me better to reach apples at (2, 6) and (5, 1)\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 0) positions me to reach apples at (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)\n\nFuture Considerations:\n- After moving right to (2, 1), I'll be positioned to move up to reach apples\n- This move keeps me away from the enemy and positions me well for future moves\n- The enemy is moving left toward the cluster of apples on the right side\n- I should try to secure apples on the left side to maintain my lead\n\nBest Move:\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 1) is the better choice - it's safe, positions me better for future apples, and keeps me away from the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",
