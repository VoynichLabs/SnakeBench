          "rationale": "Let's break this down step by step.  \n\n**Current position:**  \nMy snake (ID 1) head at (9, 1).  \nSnake #0 head at (0, 7).  \nApples: (8,0), (1,6), (3,1), (7,7), (4,1).  \n\n**Possible moves:**  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 2) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 0) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 1) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board (10, 1) \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated immediately.  \n\n**Safety check:**  \nNo body segments yet, so no risk of hitting myself.  \nSnake #0 is far away, so no immediate collision risk unless we both move into same cell this turn \u2014 but (9,2), (9,0), (8,1) are far from enemy\u2019s possible moves from (0,7).  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples: (8,0) is 1 move away (DOWN then LEFT? Actually: from (9,1) to (8,0) is distance 2: either LEFT then DOWN or DOWN then LEFT).  \n(4,1) and (3,1) are far.  \n(1,6) far.  \n(7,7) far.  \n\nActually, (8,0) is Manhattan distance 2: |9-8| + |1-0| = 1 + 1 = 2.  \n(3,1) is distance 6.  \n(4,1) is distance 5.  \n\nSo (8,0) is the closest apple.  \n\n**Best move toward (8,0):**  \nFrom (9,1) to (8,0):  \n- LEFT (8,1) then next turn DOWN (8,0) \u2192 gets apple in 2 moves.  \n- DOWN (9,0) then next turn LEFT (8,0) \u2192 also 2 moves.  \n\nBoth are equally short. But which is safer?  \n\nCheck board:  \nLEFT (8,1): safe, no obstacles.  \nDOWN (9,0): safe, no obstacles.  \n\nBut DOWN (9,0) is closer to apple (8,0) in terms of next step: after DOWN, I\u2019m at (9,0), apple at (8,0) is adjacent LEFT. That means next turn I can eat it unless snake #0 somehow interferes, but they are far away.  \n\nLEFT (8,1) means next turn I go to (8,0) to eat apple.  \n\nBoth seem fine, but maybe going DOWN first is slightly better because it gets me closer to the apple immediately (Manhattan distance 1 next turn).  \n\nAlso, DOWN keeps more options: from (9,0) next turn I can go LEFT to apple, UP back to (9,1), or RIGHT invalid. But from (8,1) next turn, I can go DOWN to apple, LEFT to (7,1), UP to (8,2), RIGHT to (9,1). Actually both have 3 options next turn.  \n\nHmm, but if I go LEFT now to (8,1), I\u2019m closer to center board, might have more options long-term. But early game, eating quickly is good.  \n\nLet\u2019s check if DOWN is safe: (9,0) is on board, no snake there, no body. Safe.  \n\n**Future options:**  \nAfter eating apple at (8,0), my tail will be at (9,1) initially, so my body will block (9,1) briefly, but I\u2019ll have to plan next move after eating.  \n\nActually, simplest: go DOWN now, eat apple next turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (8,0), my body will be [(8,0), (9,1)? Wait, no \u2014 growth happens after move, so after eating, body = old head position becomes tail. So path: turn 0: head at (9,1), move DOWN to (9,0) \u2014 no apple, so no growth. Wait, apple at (8,0) not (9,0). So DOWN this turn doesn\u2019t get apple, only sets up for next turn.  \n\nActually, if I want apple in fewest moves:  \n- This turn DOWN to (9,0) \u2192 next turn LEFT to (8,0) eat apple.  \n- This turn LEFT to (8,1) \u2192 next turn DOWN to (8,0) eat apple.  \n\nSame number of moves. But if I go LEFT now, I\u2019m at (8,1), which is closer to other apples (4,1),(3,1) later. DOWN now leaves me at edge.  \n\nEdge might be riskier long-term. Better to move toward center for more options.  \n\nSo LEFT seems better strategically.  \n\n**Final choice:** LEFT.  \n\n**Rationale for next turn:**  \nMoved toward center and set up to eat (8,0) next turn. After eating, plan path to avoid trapping self since body will grow. Prefer moving toward central apples (3,1),(4,1) afterward.  \n\nLEFT",

Eating it now gains +1 apple and grows length to 2.  \n\n**Safety after eating:**  \nIf I eat apple at (8,0), my body will be [(8,0), (8,1)]? Wait \u2014 no:  \nCurrent head (8,1), body none. After moving DOWN to (8,0) and eating apple:  \nNew head at (8,0), body = [old head] = [(8,1)].  \n\nSo my tail will be at (8,1), which is behind me.

If I go DOWN to eat it, I risk being adjacent next turn with enemy possibly moving into my head. But if I don\u2019t take it, enemy likely will get it next turn, giving them apple lead.  \n\nGiven scores are tied (3 vs 3), getting this apple could give me a lead. But survival is more important.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nI\u2019ll take the apple but prepare to evade next turn.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (3,5), I\u2019ll avoid going DOWN to (3,5) next turn (head-on collision risk). Instead, I\u2019ll go LEFT or RIGHT from (3,6) to safety.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

That path is clear now, but enemy could cut me off or collide if they move toward (3,3) or (4,3).  \nIf I go LEFT to (1,6), I move away from apples but stay safe and keep space.  \nIf I go UP to (2,7), I move toward (4,8) eventually, but my body blocks immediate rightward movement.  \n\n**Future mobility from each move:**  \n- UP (2,7): next turn can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is body at (2,6) after move).  \n- DOWN (2,5): next turn can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP is body at (2,6)).  \n- LEFT (1,6): next turn can go UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT is body at (2,6)).  \n\nAll three give 3 safe follow-ups.  \n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy\u2019s head at (5,4) is 3 Manhattan from (2,6). If I go DOWN to (2,5), distance to enemy becomes 4. If enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), distance stays 3. Not an immediate collision risk.  \nHead-on collision risk is low unless we both move into same cell \u2014 unlikely given positions.  \n\n**Longer-term plan:**  \nI want to collect apples while avoiding being trapped by my own long body. My body runs along x=3 from y=6 to y=9, blocking my right side. I should loop left/down to eventually approach (4,8) from the left or (2,3) if safe.  \nEnemy may go for (6,3) or (4,8) too. (4,8) is closer to me if I go up now.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nGoing DOWN toward (2,3) seems reasonable, but let\u2019s check: from (2,5) next turn, I can go DOWN to (2,4) (then apple (2,3) on turn after), or go LEFT/right to maneuver.  \nGoing UP to (2,7) moves toward (4,8) but I\u2019d need to go right eventually, which is blocked by my body for now \u2014 so UP may lead to a detour.  \nLEFT is safe but delays apple collection.  \n\nGiven scores are tied 4\u20134, I should try to get next apple before enemy. (2,3) is closest and reachable in 3 turns if I go DOWN now. Enemy is farther from (2,3) (distance 5 from (5,4)), so I can likely get there first if I commit.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2,5), move DOWN to (2,4) if clear, then to (2,3) for apple, unless enemy moves toward (3,3) threatening collision \u2014 then adjust left/right.

Wait: after eating, my body will be [(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,6),(3,7)] \u2014 so (2,4) is my body segment, so UP is illegal.  \n   - Other moves from (2,3): DOWN (2,2) empty, LEFT (1,3) empty, RIGHT (3,3) enemy body currently (enemy tail at (3,3) now, but enemy moves this turn).  \n   - Enemy could move DOWN to (6,2) or LEFT to (5,3) or RIGHT to (7,3). None directly threaten collision this turn.  \n   - Risk: If enemy goes LEFT to (5,3), they\u2019re still far. If enemy goes DOWN to (6,2), they move away.  \n   - However, after I eat apple, my length increases, and my tail stays at (3,7) \u2014 so my body blocks UP but DOWN/LEFT remain safe unless enemy moves into (3,3) or (1,3) next turn.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (1,4)**  \n   - From (1,4) next moves: UP (1,5) empty, DOWN (1,3) empty, LEFT (0,4) empty, RIGHT (2,4) my body.

Safe.\n- **LEFT**: (5, 3) \u2014 Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (7, 3) \u2014 Empty. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Threat Check:**\nEnemy head is at (2, 4). My head is at (6, 3). They are 4 cells away (Manhattan distance). They cannot reach me in one move. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Apple Proximity and Strategy:**\n- Closest apple is (2, 3), but it's near the enemy. Moving towards it (LEFT, then DOWN) could be risky.\n- Apple (4, 8) is up and left, but I'd have to navigate around my own body which is currently blocking the path upward from my head.\n- My immediate area is a bit constrained because UP is blocked by my body. I need to move away from my body to open up space.\n\n**Next Turn Safety (for each safe move):**\n- **DOWN to (6, 2):** From there, next turn I can go DOWN (6,1), LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2). UP (6,3) would be my new body segment. So 3 safe options likely. Opens space south.\n- **LEFT to (5, 3):** From there, next turn I can go DOWN (5,2), LEFT (4,3), UP (5,4) is my body? Let's check body future: After move, body becomes [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]. So UP (5,4) is a body segment (invalid). RIGHT (6,3) is body. So only DOWN and LEFT would be safe next turn. That's a potential trap (only 2 options, and one leads along the wall). Less desirable.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 3):** From there, next turn I can go UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2), RIGHT (8,3). LEFT (6,3) would be body. So 3 safe options. This moves me into more open space on the right side of the board, towards apples (7,7) and (8,8) in the long term.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT seems best. It gives good future mobility and starts a path towards the cluster of apples in the top-right. LEFT is risky due to limited future moves. DOWN is acceptable but leads away from the majority of apples. RIGHT balances safety and objective (getting more apples).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving RIGHT, aim to go UP/RIGHT towards the (7,7) apple, carefully checking the enemy's position. Avoid getting pinched between my body and the wall.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

However, enemy\u2019s body currently occupies (6,3) and (6,4). If enemy moves UP/LEFT/RIGHT, (6,3) will still be occupied by its next segment? Let\u2019s check: enemy body order: head (7,7), then (7,6),(7,5),(7,4),(7,3),(6,3),(6,4) tail. Actually (6,3) is second-to-last, (6,4) is last. If enemy moves, the whole body shifts: head moves, each segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position. So (6,3) will become (7,3) (since (7,3) is the segment before (6,3) in body order). That means (6,3) will be vacated. So (6,3) could be safe next turn. But need to check if enemy\u2019s new head position could be (6,3) if it goes LEFT twice? No, enemy moves only one step.

Actually, if I eat apple at (9,1), my length becomes 7, so next turn my body will be: head at (9,1), then (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2). So from (9,1) next turn: possible moves? Let's check:  \nFrom (9,1): UP (9,2) empty, DOWN (9,0) empty, LEFT (8,1) my body, RIGHT off board. So 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). That\u2019s okay but not great.  \n\nBut if I go RIGHT to (8,1) and don\u2019t eat apple yet, then from (8,1) without eating: safe moves UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 moves). That\u2019s better mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (9,1) distance from (7,1): |9-7| + |1-1| = 2.  \n- (4,0) distance: |4-7| + |0-1| = 3+1=4.  \n- (3,0) distance: 5.  \n- (9,7) distance: 8.  \n- (4,8) distance: 10.  \n\nRIGHT moves toward (9,1).  \nUP moves toward (4,8) but very far.  \nDOWN moves toward (4,0) or (3,0).  \n\nGiven enemy is at (9,8) and might go DOWN to (9,7) to eat that apple, I should grab (9,1) soon before enemy possibly comes down. But enemy is far for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term safety:**  \nEnemy is longer (9 vs my 6), so avoid going near it. It\u2019s in top-right, I\u2019m bottom-right. Going RIGHT toward (9,1) is safe now.  \n\nUP to (7,2) puts me closer to enemy\u2019s body at (7,3) etc., riskier.  \nDOWN to (7,0) is safe but fewer apples nearby after (4,0).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives best immediate mobility (3 safe next moves) and moves toward closest apple. I can decide next turn whether to eat (9,1) or maneuver around it to keep mobility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8,1) now, next turn I can go UP/DOWN/RIGHT. If enemy moves toward (9,7), I can safely eat (9,1) or avoid to keep options open.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Keeps options open.\n- LEFT (8, 7): Moves toward the center. Also safe.\n\n**Risk check:**\nEnemy #0 is at (8, 1). It's far away and no immediate head-on collision is possible. However, I need to consider its potential moves. It might move UP (8,2), DOWN (8,0), LEFT (7,1), or RIGHT (9,1). RIGHT (9,1) is an apple, so that's a likely move for it. That doesn't threaten me directly this turn.\n\n**Plan:**\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are safe. I need to think about future moves and apples.\n- DOWN (9,6): From there, I can go LEFT (8,6) or UP (9,7) (but that's my current body, so not safe next turn). This might lead me southward.\n- LEFT (8,7): From there, I can go UP (8,8) (my body), DOWN (8,6), or LEFT (7,7) (my body). So only DOWN is safe from (8,7). This is a potential trap.\n\nLEFT leads to a position with only one safe move next turn (DOWN), which is risky. DOWN gives me more options (LEFT or potentially UP if my body moves). Therefore, DOWN is better for keeping future options open.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving DOWN, aim to navigate toward the cluster of apples at (3,0), (4,0), (3,1) by heading left and down. Avoid getting trapped against the edges or my own body. Monitor enemy #0's movement toward the (9,1) apple.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nDOWN",

So eliminate LEFT now \u2014 it's a delayed death.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (9,1) \u2014 reachable from (9,2) next turn via DOWN.  \nOther apples (3,1), (3,0), (4,0) are far left, (4,8) is top center.  \nEnemy is long and blocks column 7 from y=3 to y=8, so moving UP risks being near enemy\u2019s territory soon.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Safety and growth:**  \nEnemy has 9 apples, I have 5. Need to catch up but safely.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9,2), next turn I can go DOWN to (9,1) to eat apple, but then I\u2019d be at (9,1) with only UP/DOWN moves again (like last turn\u2019s rationale warned). That\u2019s risky.  \n\nIf I go UP to (8,3), I have only UP/RIGHT next turn \u2014 could go RIGHT to (9,3) then maybe DOWN toward (9,1) later, but that\u2019s slower.  \n\nActually, going RIGHT now to (9,2) and then next turn going UP to (9,3) (avoid eating apple immediately) might keep mobility better than eating apple right away. But from (9,2), going UP to (9,3) leaves apple uneaten but safe.  \n\nBut check: from (9,2), DOWN to (9,1) eats apple \u2192 length 7, body includes (8,1),(7,1),(6,1),(6,2),(5,2),(4,2) plus new tail at old tail (4,2)? Wait, eating apple means next turn my tail stays at (4,2) (I grow by 1, so tail doesn\u2019t move). So my body next turn if I eat (9,1): head (9,1), then (8,2)? No \u2014 careful: current body: head (8,2), then (8,1),(7,1),(6,1),(6,2),(5,2). If I move RIGHT to (9,2), body becomes [(9,2),(8,2),(8,1),(7,1),(6,1),(6,2)] \u2014 tail (5,2) gone. If I then move DOWN to (9,1) and eat apple, body becomes [(9,1),(9,2),(8,2),(8,1),(7,1),(6,1),(6,2)] \u2014 length 7.  \n\nFrom (9,1) after eating:  \n- UP (9,2): my body (illegal).  \n- DOWN (9,0): empty.  \n- LEFT (8,1): my body (illegal).  \n- RIGHT off board.  \nOnly DOWN is safe \u2014 that\u2019s a death trap. So eating (9,1) next turn is bad unless tail moves first.  \n\nBetter to eat (9,1) when tail has moved away so that after eating, I have more space behind head.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT (7,2) is suicide next turn.  \nRIGHT (9,2) leads to a tough choice next turn (eat apple and die, or avoid apple and stay safe).  \nUP (8,3) gives 2 safe moves next turn and avoids immediate danger.  \n\nUP seems safest now. From (8,3), I can go RIGHT to (9,3) next turn, then maybe later get (9,1) when tail has moved.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,3), go RIGHT to (9,3) to stay near top edge but away from enemy\u2019s column 7. Avoid (9,1) until tail clears space. Consider path toward (4,8) apple later via top row.\n\nUP",

Wait, enemy body list: (7,4) is part of it, but (7,3) is not listed. Let\u2019s check board: at (7,3) there\u2019s nothing shown (enemy body ends at (7,4)). Actually, enemy body is (9,6),(9,7),(9,8),(8,8),(7,8),(7,7),(7,6),(7,5),(7,4). So (7,3) is empty. So LEFT (7,3) is legal.  \n- RIGHT (9,3): empty.  \n\nLegal: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Immediate collision risk with enemy:**  \nEnemy head at (9,5). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP (9,6): its own body (illegal).  \n- DOWN (9,4): empty.  \n- LEFT (8,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT: off board (illegal).  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5).  \n\nMy possible heads:  \n- UP (8,4): safe from enemy head this turn.  \n- LEFT (7,3): safe.  \n- RIGHT (9,3): safe.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility after each move:**  \n\n**UP to (8,4):**  \nFrom (8,4):  \n- UP (8,5): empty (enemy could move there this turn, but next turn it\u2019s empty unless enemy stays).  \n- DOWN (8,3): my body (illegal).  \n- LEFT (7,4): enemy body (illegal).  \n- RIGHT (9,4): empty (enemy could move there this turn, but next turn it\u2019s empty unless enemy stays).  \nSo 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT) unless enemy occupies one of them this turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (7,3):**  \nFrom (7,3):  \n- UP (7,4): enemy body (illegal).  \n- DOWN (7,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (6,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (8,3): my body (illegal).  \nSo 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT).  \n\n**RIGHT to (9,3):**  \nFrom (9,3):  \n- UP (9,4): empty (enemy could move there this turn).  \n- DOWN (9,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (8,3): my body (illegal).  \n- RIGHT off board (illegal).  \nSo 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN) unless enemy occupies (9,4) this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (9,1) \u2014 2 steps away via RIGHT then DOWN.  \nOther apples are far left/bottom: (3,1), (3,0), (4,0).  \n(4,8) is far away.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (9,3), next turn I could go DOWN to (9,2), then DOWN again to (9,1) to eat apple. But eating (9,1) from (9,2) would leave me at (9,1) with only DOWN safe (UP into body, LEFT into body, RIGHT off board) \u2192 trap. So I should eat (9,1) only when my tail has moved away from behind me.\n\nCurrently my tail is at (6,2). It will move next turn if I don\u2019t eat an apple. So maybe delay eating (9,1) until after tail moves.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy is long (length 10) and occupies column 7 from y=4 to y=8. It blocks my path upward through column 7.  \nIf I go LEFT to (7,3), I\u2019m adjacent to enemy body at (7,4). Enemy could move DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5) this turn, not threatening me directly, but being near enemy body reduces my future moves.  \n\nIf I go UP to (8,4), I\u2019m closer to enemy\u2019s possible next head positions (8,5) or (9,4).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,3), I\u2019m near bottom-right corner but away from enemy\u2019s current position.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Safety first:**  \nAll three moves seem safe this turn and give 2 safe moves next turn.  \nLEFT (7,3) puts me near enemy body but not in immediate danger.  \nRIGHT (9,3) puts me near apple (9,1) but risks being trapped if I eat it too soon.  \nUP (8,4) moves toward center, more open space upward.\n\nGiven enemy is longer, I should avoid getting trapped in the bottom-right corner. UP seems best for keeping space.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,4), consider going RIGHT to (9,4) if empty, or UP to (8,5) if safe. Avoid eating (9,1) until tail clears space behind head. Consider path toward (4,8) later via top row.\n\nUP",

No. My body? No. Board edge? No. So **valid**.\n- **LEFT (8, 2):** Enemy body segment (from snake #0) is there \u2192 suicidal \u2192 **invalid**.\n- **RIGHT:** Off the board \u2192 **invalid**.\n\nSo only safe move is DOWN to (9, 1).\n\n**Enemy prediction:** enemy head at (6, 4)\nTheir possible moves:\n- UP (6,5) \u2014 empty\n- DOWN (6,3) \u2014 empty\n- LEFT (5,4) \u2014 empty\n- RIGHT (7,4) \u2014 their own body \u2014 invalid.\n\nThey might go for apples toward bottom-left (3,0) area. Not an immediate threat to me at (9,1) this turn.\n\n**Next turn from (9,1) if I go DOWN now:**\nFrom (9,1) next turn:\n- UP (9,2) \u2014 might be blocked by my tail? Currently (9,2) is my head now, but next turn tail moves possibly \u2014 hard to tell; better to check after move. Likely safe.\n- DOWN (9,0) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT (8,1) \u2014 enemy body? Currently (8,1) is snake #0's tail \u2014 it will move when snake moves, so that cell becomes empty? Wait, tail only moves if snake eats apple. They have 5 apples, length 6 segments (head + 5 body). If they don't eat apple, tail moves forward, so (8,1) might be empty next turn. Possibly safe. Must assume they might go there though.\n- RIGHT \u2014 off board \u2192 invalid.\n\nEating apple will make me grow, so tail stays put next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan after this move:**\n\nFrom (9,1) after eating apple, I'll be long. I should quickly path toward bottom-left apple cluster (3,0),(4,0),(3,1) by going left along bottom row or up through the left side to avoid enemy. The enemy is near (6,4) so they might also head that way. Need to be careful of head-on collisions; maybe let them go there first and I approach carefully from another angle, possibly sticking to edges. After (9,1), next turn: LEFT to (8,1) likely safe unless enemy moves there, but if enemy goes toward bottom-left, they would go LEFT/DOWN from (6,4) \u2014 maybe to (5,4) or (6,3) \u2014 not to (8,1) in one turn, so LEFT next turn should be safe.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, check board: enemy body includes (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), etc. (7,5) is empty now. But enemy could move there? Actually enemy at (9,2) can\u2019t reach (7,5) in 1 move. So (7,5) is safe next turn.  \n\nSo from (6,5) next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 moves).  \n\n**DOWN to (6,3):**  \nFrom (6,3):  \n- UP (6,4): my body next turn \u2014 illegal.  \n- DOWN (6,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (5,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (7,3): empty.  \n\nSo from (6,3) next turn: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 moves).  \n\n**LEFT to (5,4):**  \nFrom (5,4):  \n- UP (5,5): empty.  \n- DOWN (5,3): empty.  \n- LEFT (4,4): empty.  \n- RIGHT (6,4): my body next turn \u2014 illegal.  \n\nSo from (5,4) next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 moves).  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 legal moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples in Manhattan distance from (6,4):  \n- (3,1): dist = |6-3| + |4-1| = 3+3 = 6  \n- (3,0): 3+4 = 7  \n- (4,0): 2+4 = 6  \n- (4,8): 2+4 = 6  \n- (9,1): 3+3 = 6  \n\nBut (9,1) is near enemy head (9,2) \u2014 risky.  \n(4,8) is far up, near enemy body at (8,8), (7,8), (9,8).  \n\nBest cluster is bottom-left: (3,0), (4,0), (3,1).  \n\nFrom (6,4):  \n- LEFT to (5,4) gets me closer to those apples (Manhattan to (3,1) becomes 5).  \n- DOWN to (6,3) also gets closer (Manhattan to (3,1) becomes 5 as well).  \n- UP to (6,5) moves away from them.  \n\nSo UP is worse for apple targeting.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Safety from enemy:**  \nEnemy is long (length 10) and at (9,2). If enemy goes LEFT to (8,2), then next turn it could threaten (7,2) or (8,1) etc. My tail is at (8,1) currently, but will move to (8,2) if I move? Wait, my body: head (6,4), then (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1). So (8,2) is my 5th segment. If enemy moves to (8,2) this turn, it dies (hits my body). So enemy likely avoids (8,2) unless it misjudges.  \n\nThus enemy likely goes DOWN to (9,1) to eat apple. That moves it away from me.  \n\nSo I can safely go toward bottom-left apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose between DOWN and LEFT:**  \nBoth give same next-turn mobility (3 moves) and both get me closer to bottom-left apples.  \n\nLEFT to (5,4) keeps me more central, maybe better access to multiple apples later.  \nDOWN to (6,3) puts me closer to bottom row but near my own body\u2019s future positions.  \n\nActually, from (6,3), next turn I could go LEFT to (5,3) toward apples.  \nFrom (5,4), next turn I could go DOWN to (5,3) toward apples.  \n\nBoth are fine, but LEFT might be slightly safer because enemy at (9,1) next turn is farther from (5,4) than from (6,3) in Manhattan distance? Let\u2019s check:  \nEnemy at (9,1) to (5,4): dist 4+3=7  \nEnemy at (9,1) to (6,3): dist 3+2=5  \n\nSo LEFT puts me farther from enemy next turn if enemy eats apple at (9,1).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (3,1), (3,0), (4,0) cluster. Avoid top-right area where enemy body is. Keep distance from enemy head.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, check: my previous body before moving last turn was: head (6,4), body (7,4),(8,4),(8,3),(8,2),(8,1). After moving LEFT to (5,4), new body is: head (5,4), then (6,4),(7,4),(8,4),(8,3),(8,2). So tail is now at (8,2), not (8,1). So (8,1) is empty.  \n\nThus enemy can safely go LEFT to (8,1).  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible because enemy is at least 3 cells away in Manhattan distance from all my possible moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility after each move:**  \n\n**UP to (5,5):**  \nFrom (5,5):  \n- UP (5,6): empty.  \n- DOWN (5,4): my body next turn \u2014 illegal.  \n- LEFT (4,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT (6,5): empty.  \n\nSo 3 legal moves next turn.  \n\n**DOWN to (5,3):**  \nFrom (5,3):  \n- UP (5,4): my body next turn \u2014 illegal.  \n- DOWN (5,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (4,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (6,3): empty.  \n\nSo 3 legal moves next turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (4,4):**  \nFrom (4,4):  \n- UP (4,5): empty.  \n- DOWN (4,3): empty.  \n- LEFT (3,4): empty.  \n- RIGHT (5,4): my body next turn \u2014 illegal.  \n\nSo 3 legal moves next turn.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 legal moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples in Manhattan distance from (5,4):  \n- (3,1): dist = 2+3=5  \n- (3,0): 2+4=6  \n- (4,0): 1+4=5  \n- (4,8): 1+4=5  \n- (5,8): 0+4=4  \n\n(5,8) is closest (distance 4), but it\u2019s near enemy territory (enemy body at (7,8),(8,8),(9,8)).  \n(4,8) also near enemy body.  \n\nBottom-left cluster (3,0),(4,0),(3,1) is safer and enemy is far away now.  \n\nFrom (5,4):  \n- DOWN to (5,3) gets closer to bottom-left apples (Manhattan to (3,1) becomes 4).  \n- LEFT to (4,4) also gets closer (Manhattan to (3,1) becomes 4).  \n- UP to (5,5) moves away from bottom-left apples.  \n\nSo UP is worse for apple targeting.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Safety from enemy:**  \nEnemy at (9,1) can go DOWN to (9,0) or LEFT to (8,1). If enemy goes LEFT to (8,1), it will be closer to me but still 4 cells away from (4,4) or (5,3) in Manhattan distance.  \n\nEnemy length 11 vs my length 6 \u2014 avoid head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose between DOWN and LEFT:**  \nBoth give same mobility.  \n\nLEFT to (4,4) moves toward left side, away from enemy\u2019s right-side territory.  \nDOWN to (5,3) moves toward bottom apples.  \n\nCheck next turn options:  \nFrom (4,4), next turn I can go DOWN to (4,3) toward (3,1) or LEFT to (3,4).  \nFrom (5,3), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,3) toward (3,1) or DOWN to (5,2).  \n\nBoth fine, but LEFT to (4,4) might be slightly better because:  \n- Enemy might move toward bottom-left later if it wants apples, but currently enemy is far.  \n- (4,4) is farther from enemy\u2019s possible position next turn (if enemy goes LEFT to (8,1), Manhattan distance to (4,4) is 7; to (5,3) is 5).  \n\nSo LEFT seems safer.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nHead toward (3,1) apple cluster. Avoid top row where enemy body is. Keep checking enemy head movement to maintain safe distance.  \n\nLEFT",

They might go toward apples at (3,0),(4,0),(3,1) via LEFT/DOWN, or toward (4,8),(5,8) via UP/LEFT.\n\n**Next turn considerations:**\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (9, 0):\n- Next turn from (9,0): UP (9,1) \u2014 currently my body segment (9,1) will move away if I don't eat apple? Wait \u2014 I'm not eating apple this turn if I go DOWN (no apple at (9,0)), so my tail will move from (7,7) to next segment, so (9,1) becomes empty next turn? Actually: my body list is [(9,2),...,(7,7)]. If I move to (9,0) without eating, the tail moves: new body becomes [(9,0),(9,1),(9,2),...,(8,8)] \u2014 so (9,1) will be my body segment next turn \u2014 so UP from (9,0) next turn would be suicidal. So DOWN now leaves me with possibly only LEFT (8,0) and DOWN off board invalid, RIGHT off board invalid \u2014 so only LEFT next turn \u2014 risky.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (8, 1):\n- No apple there.\n- Next turn from (8,1): possible moves: UP (8,2) \u2014 currently enemy tail (8,2) \u2014 but enemy moves this turn, so if enemy doesn't eat apple, their tail moves and (8,2) becomes empty. But enemy might eat apple and grow \u2014 uncertain. DOWN (8,0) empty. LEFT (7,1) empty. RIGHT (9,1) \u2014 currently my body segment (9,1) \u2014 but after I move to (8,1) without eating, my tail moves: new body = [(8,1),(9,1),(9,2),...,(8,8)] \u2014 so (9,1) still body next turn \u2192 RIGHT invalid. So next turn from (8,1): UP depends on enemy move, DOWN safe, LEFT safe, RIGHT invalid. More options than DOWN option.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI need to target apples safely. The cluster at (3,0),(4,0),(3,1) is attractive but enemy may head there. The apples at (4,8),(5,8) are also options but far. Going LEFT now to (8,1) keeps me flexible to go DOWN/LEFT next turn toward bottom-left apples, avoiding potential head-on with enemy approaching from (5,4). Going DOWN to (9,0) corners me with fewer options next turn.\n\nLEFT seems better for maintaining mobility.\n\nLEFT",

So (3,1) will be safe next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n- LEFT (2,2): empty.  \n- RIGHT (4,2): empty.  \nSo 3 legal moves next turn if apple is eaten (growth adds tail later), but even if not eaten, still 3 legal moves.\n\n**LEFT to (2,3):**  \nFrom (2,3):  \n- UP (2,4): empty.  \n- DOWN (2,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (1,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,3): my body next turn \u2192 illegal.  \nSo 3 legal moves next turn.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,3):**  \nFrom (4,3):  \n- UP (4,4): my body next turn \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN (4,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (3,3): my body next turn \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (5,3): empty.  \nSo 2 legal moves next turn (DOWN, RIGHT). Worse.\n\nSo RIGHT is worse for future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Safety from enemy:**  \nEnemy is far (5 steps away). Going DOWN toward bottom-left apples keeps me away from enemy\u2019s territory (top-right).  \nEnemy length 11 vs my 6 \u2192 avoid confrontation.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN gets me closest to apple (3,1), keeps 3 legal moves next turn, and is safe.  \nLEFT also keeps 3 legal moves but delays apple.  \nRIGHT reduces future options.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo DOWN to (3,2) this turn, then next turn eat apple at (3,1) if still there (likely). After eating, I\u2019ll grow, so tail stays at (7,4) one more turn before moving. Keep moving toward (3,0) or (4,0) after, while watching enemy movement to avoid being trapped in bottom-left.\n\nDOWN",

But I can\u2019t go LEFT anyway because it\u2019s enemy\u2019s head now.  \n\n**Next turn safety after each move:**  \n- UP to (4, 2): Next turn options: UP (4, 3), DOWN (4, 1), LEFT (3, 2) enemy body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT (5, 2) empty \u2192 safe. So 2 safe moves next turn.  \n- DOWN to (4, 0): Eat apple \u2192 grow. Next turn options: UP (4, 1) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN off board \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (3, 0) apple, RIGHT (5, 0) empty. So 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Risk of head-on collision:**  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 1) and I move UP or DOWN, no collision. Enemy might go DOWN to (3, 0) apple, which is safe for me if I go DOWN too (we\u2019d be at different coords).  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nDOWN gets me an apple immediately and puts me near (3, 0) next turn. UP moves away from bottom apples but toward top apples later.  \n\n**Long-term:**  \nEating apple now increases length but also gives enemy chance to eat (3, 0). But since I\u2019m longer, I can afford to compete.  \n\nBoth UP and DOWN give same next-turn flexibility. DOWN gives immediate score gain.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating (4, 0), consider going LEFT to (3, 0) if enemy hasn\u2019t taken it, else go RIGHT to (5, 0) and then up.  \n\nDOWN",

Actually, enemy is at (4,1) now, so moving RIGHT into (4,1) means my head moves into enemy head\u2019s current cell \u2014 but enemy will also move this turn. If enemy moves away from (4,1), then (4,1) becomes empty by the time I arrive? No \u2014 simultaneous moves: we both move at same time, so if I choose RIGHT to (4,1) and enemy chooses to stay at (4,1) (impossible because staying isn\u2019t a move), or if enemy moves into (4,1) from elsewhere? Wait, enemy\u2019s head is currently at (4,1), so if enemy moves away, (4,1) is empty at start of turn, so I can move into it without collision with enemy head (since enemy head left). But if enemy moves into (4,1) from somewhere else? That\u2019s impossible because enemy starts at (4,1). So if enemy moves UP/DOWN/LEFT from (4,1), cell (4,1) is free for me to enter. However, if enemy moves LEFT to (3,1) and I move RIGHT to (4,1), we swap positions without collision. So RIGHT is not automatically lethal. But need to check possible enemy moves.  \n\nLet\u2019s check carefully:  \nEnemy at (4,1) can move:  \n- UP (4,2): empty.  \n- DOWN (4,0): apple, empty.  \n- LEFT (3,1): my head currently at (3,1) \u2192 that\u2019s a head-on collision if I stay at (3,1) and enemy moves into me. But I will move away from (3,1) if I choose DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. So if I choose RIGHT to (4,1) and enemy chooses LEFT to (3,1), we swap without occupying same cell. That\u2019s safe.  \n- RIGHT (5,1): enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo enemy legal moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nNow check my possible moves:  \n\n1. **DOWN to (3,0)** \u2013 apple there.  \nEnemy could go DOWN to (4,0) \u2013 not same cell as (3,0). Enemy could go LEFT to (3,1) \u2013 I\u2019m leaving (3,1), so no collision. Enemy could go UP to (4,2) \u2013 fine. So no head-on collision possible if I go DOWN.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (2,1)** \u2013 empty.  \nEnemy could go LEFT to (3,1) \u2013 fine. Enemy DOWN to (4,0) \u2013 fine. Enemy UP to (4,2) \u2013 fine. No conflict.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (4,1)** \u2013  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3,1), we swap, safe.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (4,2), I go to (4,1) which enemy left, safe.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (4,0), I go to (4,1) which enemy left, safe.  \nSo RIGHT is also safe from head-on collision.  \n\nSo all three moves are legal and no certain head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Risk of moving into enemy\u2019s future body segment after its move?**  \nEnemy\u2019s body after moving:  \nIf enemy moves UP to (4,2), its body becomes [(4,1), (5,1), \u2026]. So (4,1) becomes its neck. If I go RIGHT to (4,1), I\u2019d be moving into its neck \u2014 but that\u2019s fine because it\u2019s not its head, and my head into its body kills me. So **RIGHT is lethal** because (4,1) will be enemy\u2019s body segment after enemy moves UP.  \n\nSimilarly, if enemy moves DOWN to (4,0), its body becomes [(4,1), (5,1), \u2026] again, so (4,1) is its neck. If I go RIGHT to (4,1), I die.  \n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3,1), its body becomes [(4,1), (5,1), \u2026], so again (4,1) is its neck. So no matter where enemy moves, (4,1) becomes part of its body this turn (since it was its head, now becomes neck).  \n\nThus **RIGHT is always lethal** \u2014 I missed that initially. So eliminate RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Remaining safe moves:** DOWN (3,0) and LEFT (2,1).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nDOWN gets apple (3,0) immediately.  \nLEFT gets no apple but opens space.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Safety after each move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (3,0)**:  \nNext turn from (3,0):  \n- UP (3,1): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT (2,0): empty.  \n- RIGHT (4,0): apple there, but enemy could be there if enemy moved DOWN this turn.  \n\nSo next turn only LEFT and RIGHT possible, but RIGHT (4,0) might be occupied by enemy this turn \u2014 let\u2019s check: enemy could move DOWN to (4,0) this turn. If that happens, (4,0) will be enemy head, not safe for me next turn. But if enemy doesn\u2019t go DOWN, (4,0) is apple.  \n\nRisk: If I go DOWN to (3,0) and enemy goes DOWN to (4,0), next turn I can\u2019t go RIGHT (enemy head), only LEFT (2,0). That\u2019s one move, could be risky if (2,0) leads to dead end.  \n\n**LEFT to (2,1)**:  \nNext turn from (2,1):  \n- UP (2,2): empty.  \n- DOWN (2,0): empty.  \n- LEFT (1,1): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,1): my body \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo 3 options next turn, more flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy sees apple at (4,0) and (3,0) (if I don\u2019t take it). It might go DOWN to (4,0) to get apple and block me. If I go LEFT, enemy could take (4,0) and maybe (3,0) later. But I\u2019m shorter (7 vs 11), need apples to catch up.  \n\nIf I go DOWN and eat (3,0), I grow to length 8, enemy might eat (4,0) and grow to 12.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m in bottom-left area with limited space. Need to avoid getting trapped. Eating apple now gives growth but reduces future moves next turn. LEFT gives more options next turn but delays eating.  \n\nGiven enemy is long and controls right side, staying alive is priority. LEFT seems safer for future flexibility, but apple at (3,0) is tempting.  \n\nBut going DOWN to (3,0) leaves me with possibly only 1 safe move next turn if enemy goes to (4,0) \u2014 that\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nBetter to go LEFT to (2,1), keep options open, maybe go for (4,0) or (3,0) later if enemy doesn\u2019t take them.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (2,1), consider moving to (2,0) or (1,1) to stay clear of enemy, then approach apples (4,0) or (3,0) from left side if safe. Avoid bottom row dead end.  \n\nLEFT",

So LEFT is safe from collision.\n\n4. **RIGHT (5, 0)** \u2192 empty \u2192 safe?\n    - Could enemy cause collision? Enemy cannot reach (5,0) in one move from (2,1).  \n    - My own body? Not at (5,0). Safe.\n\nSo immediate safe moves: **LEFT (3,0)** apple, **RIGHT (5,0)** empty.\n\n---\n\n**Future safety and apple strategy:**\n\n- LEFT to (3,0): eat apple, grow to length 12.  \n  Next turn, options from (3,0): UP (3,1) \u2192 enemy body (segment of snake #0) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  DOWN \u2192 off-board unsafe.  \n  LEFT (2,0) \u2192 empty (unless enemy moves there this turn from (2,1)? Check: enemy could DOWN to (2,0) this turn; then my next turn LEFT to (2,0) if enemy stays \u2014 but enemy would move again on next turn\u2026 let's check:  \n  \nActually better check simultaneous move this turn first:  \n\nFrom enemy (2,1) possible moves:  \n- UP (2,2) safe empty.  \n- DOWN (2,0) safe empty.  \n- LEFT (1,1) safe empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,1) unsafe (own body).  \n\nSo enemy will not be at (3,0) this turn. But if enemy chooses DOWN (2,0) this turn, then they occupy (2,0) at the end of this turn. Then *next* turn from my (3,0):  \n- My possible moves: UP unsafe (enemy body), DOWN off-board, LEFT (2,0) enemy head collision risk?  \n\nWait: Enemy head from (2,0) next turn could go: UP to (2,1) \u2014 empty then? Actually (2,1) would be empty after they move from it this turn. They could go RIGHT to (3,0) \u2014 but that\u2019s *my* position after this turn. If we both move into the same square \u2014 only if I go LEFT into (2,0) and they go RIGHT into (2,1)? No:  \n\nLet\u2019s be systematic:\n\nIf I pick LEFT this turn:  \nThis turn: Me: (4,0) \u2192 (3,0) apple.  \nEnemy picks a move: Assume worst case: enemy goes DOWN to (2,0).  \n\nNext turn (turn 37):  \nMy head at (3,0). Enemy head at (2,0).  \nMy moves from (3,0):  \nLEFT (2,0): enemy head \u2192 possible collision if enemy moves into (2,0)? Wait, enemy at (2,0) already; next turn enemy moves from (2,0) somewhere: UP(2,1), RIGHT(3,0), LEFT(1,0).  \n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (3,0) and I go LEFT to (2,0), no collision because we swap. That\u2019s safe for head-on? Head-on collision requires both heads to land in the same cell. Swapping is safe.  \n\nActually I misread rules: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die\" \u2014 swapping means they enter each other\u2019s previous cell \u2014 different destinations \u2192 no collision. So swapping is fine.  \n\nThus from (3,0) next turn the only dangerous move is UP into enemy body or DOWN off-board. So my safe moves next turn: LEFT or RIGHT. So 2 options.  \n\nSimilarly, RIGHT to (5,0) this turn: Next turn from (5,0):  \nUP (5,1) my body \u2192 unsafe  \nDOWN off-board unsafe  \nLEFT (4,0) empty  \nRIGHT (6,0) empty  \nSo 2 options as well.  \n\nLEFT gets an apple, RIGHT doesn\u2019t but maybe safer from enemy?  \n\nEnemy can\u2019t threaten (5,0) soon anyway. But LEFT gets nutrition without obvious danger since enemy likely won\u2019t go to (3,0) this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Choice:**  \nLEFT immediately grabs apple and gives two escape routes next turn. RIGHT delays eating but also safe. Since opponent scores are a threat long-term (11 vs 6), increasing lead is good as long as not trapped. Here, trapping risk minimal because we can escape LEFT or RIGHT next turn from (3,0).  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating (3,0), likely go to (2,0) if enemy isn\u2019t there, else (4,0) and then up to top apples.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, after enemy moves to (1,0), its body becomes [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), \u2026]. So (2,0) is its neck next turn, so moving RIGHT into (2,0) is illegal for enemy (own body).  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only legal move next turn from (1,0) is LEFT to (0,0).  \n\nThat means enemy will be stuck at bottom left for a while, not an immediate threat to me unless I go near (0,1) or (0,2).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT (2,2) leaves only 1 safe move next turn \u2192 avoid.  \nLEFT (0,2) leaves 2 safe moves but traps me along left edge near enemy\u2019s possible future path (though enemy stuck at (0,0) next turn).  \nUP (1,3) leaves 3 safe moves and moves toward center/upper board, closer to apples (4,8) and (6,3) in the long run.  \n\nBest choice: **UP** to keep options open and stay away from enemy\u2019s area.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (1,3), consider moving to (1,4) or (0,3) or (2,3) to approach apple at (6,3) via a path that avoids moving into my own body and keeps distance from enemy.

That\u2019s risky \u2014 almost a trap.  \n\n**RIGHT to (3,3):**  \nNext turn from (3,3):  \n- UP (3,4): empty.  \n- DOWN (3,2): my body at (3,2) \u2192 illegal (since tail moved to (3,3), (3,2) is now empty? Wait, check: after moving RIGHT to (3,3), body becomes (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) before tail move. Tail (3,2) moves to (3,3)? That\u2019s my new head \u2014 no, tail is at (3,2) before move, after move tail moves forward to old neck (3,2)? That\u2019s wrong \u2014 let\u2019s recalc:  \n\nCurrent body: head (2,3), neck (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), tail (3,2).  \nMove RIGHT: new head (3,3). New body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). Tail (3,2) moves to (3,1)? No, tail is at (3,2) now, after move tail moves to (3,1) because snake didn\u2019t eat apple? Wait, the segment order: after move, body is: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). The last segment (3,2) is the tail. Since no apple eaten, tail disappears and all other segments shift: new body becomes (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). So tail is now at (3,1).  \n\nSo next turn from (3,3):  \n- UP (3,4): empty.  \n- DOWN (3,2): empty (since (3,2) is not in body now).  \n- LEFT (2,3): body at (2,3) \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (4,3): empty.  \n\nSo 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s future path:**  \nEnemy will be at (0,1) next turn, then likely (0,2), etc., moving up left wall. Not an immediate threat to me in center/right.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN is very dangerous (only 1 move next turn).  \nUP is safe and keeps options open but moves away from closest apple (6,3).  \nRIGHT is safe, gets closer to apple (6,3), and gives 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nBest choice: RIGHT toward apple while maintaining flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (3,3), I can go RIGHT to (4,3) or DOWN to (3,2) to approach (6,3). Avoid moving left into my own body. Enemy is confined to left edge for now, so focus on collecting apples safely.  \n\nRIGHT",

Safe.  \n\n2. **DOWN (0, 0)** \u2192 my own body segment \u2192 **dies**.  \n\n3. **LEFT (-1, 1)** \u2192 off-board \u2192 **dies**.  \n\n4. **RIGHT (1, 1)** \u2192 empty.  \n   - Enemy head could move LEFT (2, 3) \u2192 own body, so not possible, or DOWN (3, 2) \u2192 empty, but still far from (1, 1). Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Evaluation:**  \n\n- **UP (0, 2)**:  \n  - Next moves from (0, 2): UP (0, 3), RIGHT (1, 2), LEFT off-board.  \n  - Enemy body blocks (1, 2) and (1, 1), so RIGHT from (0, 2) is safe now but maybe limiting later.  \n  - Puts us closer to apples (4, 8) and (5, 8) but far away.  \n\n- **RIGHT (1, 1)**:  \n  - Next moves from (1, 1): UP (1, 2) \u2192 enemy body at (1, 2) \u2192 dies, so not safe next turn. DOWN (1, 0) \u2192 my body. LEFT (0, 1) \u2192 empty but back to current head. RIGHT (2, 1) \u2192 enemy body at (2, 1) \u2192 dies.  \n  - So from (1, 1), only LEFT is safe next turn \u2014 that\u2019s a dead-end path.  \n\nThus RIGHT is risky because it leaves only one safe move next turn (back to (0, 1)), which is a trap.  \n\nUP gives more options: from (0, 2), UP to (0, 3) or RIGHT to (1, 2) \u2014 but (1, 2) is enemy body? Wait, check board: (1, 2) is empty? No \u2014 enemy body at (1, 2)? Yes: Snake #0 body: (1, 2) is in its body. So RIGHT from (0, 2) to (1, 2) is death. So from (0, 2), only UP (0, 3) is safe next turn. Still better than RIGHT\u2019s dead-end.  \n\nActually, check: from (0, 2), moves:  \nUP (0, 3) safe.  \nRIGHT (1, 2) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 dies.  \nLEFT off-board dies.  \nDOWN (0, 1) safe? That\u2019s my body? No, (0, 1) is my current head\u2019s position, but next turn my body will have moved, so (0, 1) will be empty? Wait, careful: If I move UP to (0, 2), my body follows: head (0, 2), then segment (0, 1) (old head), then (0, 0), etc. So (0, 1) will be my own body next turn. So DOWN from (0, 2) to (0, 1) would be suicide. So only UP from (0, 2) is safe next turn.  \n\nSo both UP and RIGHT lead to only one safe move next turn, but UP keeps us moving upward toward more space and apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nWe\u2019re trapped along the top edge if we go up without going right eventually. Need to get to x > 1 to avoid enemy body blocking. Possibly next turn from (0, 2) we must go UP to (0, 3), then maybe (0, 4), until we can go RIGHT when enemy isn\u2019t threatening. Enemy at (3, 3) may move toward apples (6, 3), giving us a path on the left side.  \n\nApple at (7, 0) is far but reachable eventually; (6, 3) is closer but enemy may go for it.  \n\n---\n\n**Choice:** UP is safer in terms of opening the board upward; RIGHT leads to immediate dead-end next turn.  \n\nUP",

LEFT is illegal (own body).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Immediate head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nEnemy head at (0, 2) can move:  \n- UP (0, 3): empty.  \n- DOWN (0, 1): its own body at (0, 1) \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT: off board \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (1, 2): empty (my tail at (2, 1) is far).  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe legal moves: UP (0, 3) and RIGHT (1, 2).  \n\nMy possible moves:  \n- UP (4, 4): enemy can\u2019t reach \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (4, 2): enemy can\u2019t reach \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (5, 3): enemy can\u2019t reach \u2192 safe.  \n\nNo possible head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Moving into enemy\u2019s current body:**  \nEnemy\u2019s body includes (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1).  \nNone of my moves go into those cells.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (6, 3) at Manhattan distance |4-6| + |3-3| = 2 moves away.  \nFrom (4, 3):  \n- UP (4, 4): distance to (6, 3) = 2 + 1 = 3 \u2192 farther.  \n- DOWN (4, 2): distance = 2 + 1 = 3 \u2192 farther.  \n- RIGHT (5, 3): distance = 1 + 0 = 1 \u2192 closer.  \n\nRIGHT gets me closer to (6, 3).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Safety next turn after each move:**  \n\n**UP to (4, 4):**  \nAfter move (no apple eaten), body becomes: (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1) before tail move.

Tail (2, 1) moves to (1, 1). Final body: (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1).  \n\nNext turn from (4, 2):  \n- UP (4, 3): body at (4, 3) \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN (4, 1): empty.  \n- LEFT (3, 2): empty.  \n- RIGHT (5, 2): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**RIGHT to (5, 3):**  \nAfter move (no apple eaten), body becomes: (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1) before tail move. Tail (2, 1) moves to (1, 1). Final body: (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1).  \n\nNext turn from (5, 3):  \n- UP (5, 4): empty.  \n- DOWN (5, 2): empty.  \n- LEFT (4, 3): body at (4, 3) \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (6, 3): apple at (6, 3) \u2192 safe and I would eat it next turn if I go RIGHT then.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nAll three moves give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s future path:**  \nEnemy likely goes UP (0, 3) or RIGHT (1, 2). Either way, it\u2019s far from me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nAll three moves are safe now and keep options open next turn.  \nRIGHT moves me closer to apple (6, 3) and sets me up to eat it next turn if I go RIGHT again.  \nUP and DOWN don\u2019t progress toward nearest apple.  \n\nBest choice: RIGHT toward apple while maintaining flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (5, 3), next turn I can go RIGHT to (6, 3) to eat apple, then likely go UP toward (4,8)/(5,8) cluster. Avoid moving left into my body. Enemy is far left, so focus on collecting apples safely.  \n\nRIGHT",
