UP would bullseye the edge and kill me (off-board), so not an option. SAFE bets are DOWN (to (8,8)), LEFT (to (7,9), which also eats the top-row apple at (7,9)), or RIGHT (to (9,9)). I\u2019m choosing LEFT for two reasons:  \n- It immediately grabs the top-row apple, giving me +1 apple and increasing my length (since I start with a single head, I\u2019ll grow to length 2 with the move). This adds a little \u201cweight\u201d to my next turns and makes future blocking more feasible.  \n- It keeps me on the top edge, where I can more reliably control space and threaten to herd or pivot toward the center strategically while the rival is far away at (2,1). With the enemy so distant, the best early play is to secure a strong, longer-looking position and avoid handing him easy sprint routes.\n\nLong-term plan note: Keep high ground for turn-after-turn safety, then threaten to squeeze him into a corner as my body grows. If he dares a head-on on my terms when I\u2019m 2+ apples ahead, I\u2019ll favor a controlled collision that benefits me. Always aim to preserve multiple safe moves after each turn (so I\u2019m not getting trapped near edges or in dead-ends). Readouts: more apples = more control; more control = fewer escape routes for him. \ud83d\udd12\ud83e\udde0\n\nNow I\u2019ve claimed the top-row apple at (7,9) and my tail will start to form behind me. From here I\u2019ll look to keep options open: either push along the top edge to grab more apples (there are others at (1,9) and (4,9)) or dip down later to threaten cross-paths with him when he\u2019s closer. The key is to stay alive, grow smart, and force favorable engagements if the score difference grows. Let\u2019s nose into the top row and ride the edge to a commanding lead. \ud83e\udded\ud83d\udc40\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Moving DOWN traps us near the bottom where the board gets crowded with apples at (8,0) and (6,0) \u2013 not the hottest spot.  \n\n\ud83d\udca5 **Aggression**: We have 4 apples vs their 2. The smart play is to close the gap and force a collision when we have the score edge. Heading UP does exactly that \u2013 it sets us on a straight line with the opponent\u2019s column.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Short\u2011term plan for the next few turns**:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Move UP to (2,2) \u2013 secure the apple at (2,4) in two more moves.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn, continue UP to (2,3) \u2013 still safe, keep the column open.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 If the rival heads DOWN, we\u2019ll meet somewhere in the middle; with our higher score that\u2019s a guaranteed KO for them.  \n\nSounds like a solid strategy, right? \ud83e\udd29  \nUP",

Down also lands on the apple at (0,8, growing you).\n\nReasoning: You cannot safety-move into any other direction right now without dying. The apple at (0,8) gives you a free growth, helping you gain apples and extend your length, which can be used to box later. Right now, staying on the left edge gives you a stable platform to pressure the rival later.\n\nShort-term plan: Eat the apple by moving DOWN to (0,8). After that, hug the left edge (keep x=0) and descend to (0,7), (0,6), etc., to establish a corridor and deny space to the opponent. Use your extra length to complicate any chase and set up a potential boxed collision when you have a comfortable lead.\n\nLonger-term strategy note: Maintain awareness of the rival\u2019s apple count (they\u2019re at 4 while you\u2019ll be at 4 after the apple). If you can keep a lead, steer toward a tactical head-on collision only when you can guarantee mutual destruction with you alive and ahead. Otherwise, tighten the edge control and trap him against safe boundaries.\n\nPlan for next turns: After the apple, prioritize edge control, monitor opponent\u2019s path for openings to force a boxed interaction, and avoid giving him room to weave around your body. Stay alive first, then convert growth into control.\n\nDOWN",

Not ideal when you\u2019re behind on score.\n- DOWN keeps you on the edge, preserves space to box him in, and sets up grabbing (0,4) next turn for a clean growth spike.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (for NEXT FEW TURNS):\n- Stay hugging the left edge with DOWN now, then reassess after his chosen move.\n- If he takes UP to (1,6), continue DOWN to (0,4) next turn to eat the apple and extend the edge control.\n- Use the edge to funnel him toward the bottom-left quadrant and avoid risky center skirmishes.\n- If the opportunity presents a safe head-on trade in the future with a higher-score payoff, consider it, but only if you\u2019re not risking the lead.\n\nMOVE:\nDOWN",

It preserves a solid wall along x=0 (your current barrier) and nudges you into a better position to corral Snake #0 without risking a head-on.\n\nWhy RIGHT now:\n- Maintains the edge-box strategy you\u2019re building. If Snake #0 tries to slip left to (0,7), that cell is still within your wall and would be risky for him.\n- Keeps you within striking distance for future traps while staying alive and growing safely when possible.\n- If he goes Up to grab an apple at (1,8), he\u2019ll grow, but you\u2019ll still have the boxed nucleus to threaten later.\n\nShort-term plan (turns ahead):\n- Stay near the left edge, tighten the corridor, and coax him into a squeeze toward the bottom-left.\n- Only grow when it\u2019s safe and won\u2019t invite a direct collision; prioritize survival to keep the edge advantage.\n- If a clean head-on or forced collision presents itself with a higher-risk move, reevaluate, but today the box seems strongest.\n\nMOVE:\nRIGHT",

Moving into an opponent\u2019s body is dead territory this turn.\n  - Down to (1,3) is open. Safe option.\n  - Left to (0,4) is part of YOUR own body.

DEAD.\n- DOWN to (1,2): safe. No apple this turn, but it keeps you out of immediate danger.\n- LEFT to (0,3): safe.

DEAD.\n\nDECISION: I\u2019M GOING LEFT.\n\nWhy LEFT (0,3) over DOWN (1,2)?\n- It lets me extend a hard-edged barrier along the left wall. My current wall is already around x=0; moving to (0,3) adds a new head on the border and tightens the space Snake #0 can roam, nudging him toward the bottom-left quadrant.\n- I\u2019m behind 5 apples to 10, so I\u2019m not chasing risky head-on exchanges. A patient containment beats a reckless ram right now.\n- Left keeps multiple safe follow-ups available (I\u2019m not boxed in yet, but I\u2019m positioning to squeeze him later).\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep hugging the left border with the head at (0,3) and guard the path toward the bottom-left area. Watch for opportunities to nudge him into a bottleneck without exposing myself to a counter-trap.\n- Only eat apples when a safe, clean line opens up that doesn\u2019t invite a quick counter-kill. The apple count gap still favors Snake #0, so survival and tightening the enclosure > reckless growth.\n- If Snake #0 presses downward toward the border, use the wall to funnel him into a corner, then time a careful pivot to trap him.\n\nLonger-term strategy note for the run:\n- Maintain a persistent edge-wall pressure on the left to shrink Snake #0\u2019s usable space. The goal is to coax him into a bottleneck where a single safe bite or a forced head-on can swing the clash in our favor, but only when we have clear follow-ups and a guaranteed escape path.\n- Monitor the apple spawns; we\u2019ll grow only when it\u2019s risk-free and helps seal the enclosure rather than opening a new corridor for him to slip through.\n- Stay aware of score: with 5 vs 10, avoid unnecessary exchanges. If a clean, favorable head-on becomes available later with a guaranteed follow-up, take it\u2014but not now.\n\nLEFT",

LET'S RUN THE STRAT DOGFIGHT: BOX HIM, NOT US. \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\n\nCurrent heat map:\n- YOUR SNAKE (ID 1): Head (3,3); Body [(3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3)]\n- OPPONENT SNAKE #0: Head (4,6); Body [(5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n- Apples dropping around the board, but we\u2019re eyes-on-the-prize: stay alive, pressure the enemy, grow only when it helps the plan.\n\nSAFE MOVES FROM (3,3):\n- UP to (3,4) \u2014 safe (not in any body current cells)\n- LEFT to (2,3) \u2014 safe\n- RIGHT to (4,3) \u2014 safe\n- DOWN to (3,2) \u2014 not safe (hits our own body)\n\nWhy these three and not DOWN? Because we\u2019ll crash into our own neck if we go DOWN. We\u2019re not about self-kill today.\n\nRISK AND OPPORTUNITY CHECK:\n- No immediate head-on with opponent this turn unless they somehow force a shared cell, which we\u2019re not setting up.\n- Staying near the opponent\u2019s current zone risks getting boxed in by their wall of body along y=8 and their tail creeping downward, but we\u2019re just below them and have room to maneuver.\n- We do have a nice little left-wall tail anchor at (0,2)/(0,3). If we can squeeze them toward the left/right boundary and keep our outer edge protected, we can start pinning space without sacrificing safety.\n\nDECISION PROCESS (what I\u2019m thinking):\n- Among UP/LEFT/RIGHT, all are safe this turn. We should pick the move that leaves the most future flexibility and keeps the opponent in a contained pocket rather than chasing into their lane.\n- Going UP keeps us centered under their current head, preserves a direct line to swing around their right flank later, and avoids pressuring their tail into awkward turns too soon.\n- If they respond with a conservative option (e.g., DOWN to (4,5) or LEFT to (3,6)), UP still keeps options open to either creep around their flank or back off to the left wall.\n\nLong-term plan note (for the next few turns):\n- Gradually press toward the left wall with careful vertical scouting, using the tail as a pseudo-barrier to reduce escape routes for #0.\n- Avoid giving them a clean line to grow toward the middle; we want to force them into walls or into their own body\u2019s perimeter, not into an open chase.\n- Grow only when it preserves a tight escape path and doesn\u2019t threaten our current safe corridor. Heightened risk if we chase apples that pull us into their zone.\n\nFinal pick (this turn): UP\n\nUP",

He\u2019s parked up around (4,7) with a long backside weaving along the top-left. We\u2019re going to box him in and keep options alive, not chase fruit into a trap. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nCURRENT STATE SNAPSHOT\n- Your snake (ID 1): Head (2,5); Body [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2)]\n- Opponent (Snake #0): Head (4,7); Body [(3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]\n- Apple drops looming: many on bottom/right, a few higher up; but we\u2019re focusing on walls and safety first\n- Board vibe: you want to hold the left flank and nudge #0 toward the wall, avoid dead-ends, and grow only when it preserves escape routes\n\nMOVE OPTIONS ANALYSIS (from (2,5))\n- UP to (2,6): Safe now, but you\u2019re stepping toward the mid-upper field where #0 can realign and possibly shrink escape paths. Not bad, but a bit riskier for a sudden squeeze.\n- DOWN to (2,4): Safe and keeps you closer to center with multiple escape angles. Could allow a pivot away from the left wall if needed.\n- LEFT to (1,5): Safe and keeps you hugging the left edge. Best for enforcing the wall-anchored plan and pressuring #0 toward the vertical edge. Keeps multiple follow-ups open and preserves options to loop back.\n- RIGHT to (3,5): Not allowed. That square is currently your second segment; moving there would cross into your own neck and kill you.\n\nELIMINATED OPTIONS\n- RIGHT is a self-collision trap this turn. Not viable.\n\nDECISION\n- The safest and most strategic move to enact the wall-anchoring plan is LEFT to (1,5). It preserves escape lanes, keeps you in a controlled corridor away from the dense top-area where #0\u2019s body can trap you, and sets up potential squeezes toward the wall in the next turns.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (next 3-5 turns)\n- Hold the left edge, keep #0 near the wall, and avoid tight corners that trap you.\n- If #0 aggresses along the left side, exploit the space between his body and the wall to pivot around him without risking a head-on collision.\n- Grow only when it creates a clean escape path (e.g., eat apples that don\u2019t pull you into a trap or into his lane).\n- If a clean head-on is unavoidable, ensure you have a guaranteed escape route before engaging.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY\n- Keep applying pressure by maintaining the left-wall anchor, guiding #0 toward the boundary, and forcing missteps or awkward turns into dead zones.\n- Your current apples deficit means farming safely is priority. Don\u2019t chase risky fruit if it cages you; pick safer apples that stay within your ring of escape.\n- If you ever clinch a safer head-on opportunity with a guaranteed escape, you can force a swap of momentum on him, but only when your apples count makes the risk worthwhile.\n\nYOUR PLAY CALL FOR THIS TURN\n- LEFT\n\nLEFT",
