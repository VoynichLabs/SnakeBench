Snake #0 is at (2, 0).\nApples are at (0, 9), (7, 3), (5, 3), (2, 1), (9, 6).\n\nMy possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1. **Check for immediate death:**\n   * **UP (1, 1):** Safe.\n   * **DOWN (1, -1):** Off board. Kills me. (Eliminate)\n   * **LEFT (0, 0):** Safe.\n   * **RIGHT (2, 0):** Collides with Snake #0's head position. Since both snakes move simultaneously, this is a dangerous direct collision zone. If Snake #0 moves away (e.g., UP or RIGHT), I might be safe, but if Snake #0 stays or tries to move LEFT, we risk a head-on collision (if they move LEFT from (2,0) to(1,0)) or I hit them if they stay. Assuming Snake #0 is also seeking safety/apples, moving towards their current location is risky.\n\n2. **Analyze risk/reward for safe moves (UP, LEFT):**\n\n   * **The closest apple is (2, 1).**\n   * Snake #0 is at (2, 0).\n\n   * **Move UP to (1, 1):**\n     * This moves me one step closer to the apple at (2, 1) if I then move RIGHT/UP.\n     * It avoids immediate collision with Snake #0.\n     * From (1, 1), my possible next moves (T1) would be (0, 1), (2, 1) (apple), (1, 2).\n\n   * **Move LEFT to (0, 0):**\n     * This moves me away from the center of the board and takes me to the edge.\n     * It's safe.\n     * From (0, 0), my possible next moves (T1) would be (0, 1) (still far from (2, 1)), (1, 0) (backwards, but safe since I have no body), (-1, 0) (suicide).\n\n3. **Considering Snake #0's likely move:**\n   Snake #0 is at (2, 0). The apple (2, 1) is directly UP from them.\n   * Snake #0 will almost certainly move UP to (2, 1) to get the first apple.\n\n4. **Strategic Decision:**\n   If I choose UP to (1, 1):\n   * Snake #0 chooses UP to (2, 1) and eats the apple, growing to length 2.\n   * I am safe at (1, 1).\n   * Snake #0 has secured the closest apple.\n\n   If I choose LEFT to (0, 0):\n   * Snake #0 chooses UP to (2, 1) and eats the apple.\n   * I am safe at (0, 0).\n\n   If I try to move RIGHT to (2, 0) to block them or get closer to (2, 1):\n   * If Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 1), I successfully move to (2, 0) and am positioned for the next move towards the apple, although it will be gone.\n   * If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1, 0), we collide head-on, and both die. This is highly risky, as they might try to block me or simply move left.\n\nSince Snake #0 is prioritizing the apple at (2, 1), which is immediately available by moving UP, I should focus on safe separation and maneuvering towards other apples.\n\nMoving UP to (1, 1) is the best choice. It sets me up to challenge Snake #0 for future apples on the right side (like (5, 3) or (7, 3) via the center) or move towards the apple at (0, 9). It also keeps me off the bottom edge.\n\nLet's confirm the safety of moving UP.\nMove: (1, 0) -> (1, 1). Safe.\n\nMy immediate goal is safe separation and gathering other apples (e.g., (5, 3) or (7, 3)). Allowing Snake #0 to take (2, 1) is acceptable given the high risk of collision attempting to contest it right now.\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP, then likely RIGHT and UP towards the center apples (5, 3) and (7, 3), while maintaining space from Snake #0.\n\nUP",

Move: UP. -> T1 Head: (1, 1). (This matches the current state).\nT0 Snake 0: (3, 0).\nApple at (2, 1) is present on the map display provided for T1.\n\n*Wait, the provided board state shows the position *after* the moves for Turn 0 have been executed and the state has updated to Turn 1.*\n\nPrevious moves (Turn 0):\nMy move: UP. (1, 0) -> (1, 1).\nSnake 0 move: UNKNOWN. Head is now at (3, 0). (It must have moved to (3, 0) if it started elsewhere, or stayed at (3, 0) if it started there. The last move information for Turn 0 said Snake 0 was at (3, 0). If Snake 0 was at (3, 0) in T0, and it is at (3, 0) now, it means it either moved LEFT from (4, 0), DOWN from (3, 1), RIGHT from (2, 0) to (3, 0), or stayed (which is impossible for a snake). Since the rules say \"Your snake (ID: 1) apples: 0\" and \"Snake #0 apples: 0\", and the apple (2, 1) is still on the board, no apple was eaten in T0.\n\nLet's stick strictly to the current state (T1):\nMy Head: (1, 1). Body: none.\nSnake #0 Head: (3, 0). Body: none.\nApples: (0, 9), (7, 3), (5, 3), (2, 1), (9, 6).\n\nThe closest apple to me is (2, 1). Distance: Manhattan 2.\nThe closest apple to Snake #0 is (2, 1). Distance: Manhattan 2 (UP, LEFT). Or (5, 3). Manhattan 5.\n\nBoth snakes are currently competing for: (2, 1).\nSnake 1 (me) at (1, 1):\n  UP -> (1, 2)\n  DOWN -> (1, 0)\n  LEFT -> (0, 1)\n  RIGHT -> (2, 1) **(Apple)**\n\nSnake 0 at (3, 0):\n  UP -> (3, 1)\n  DOWN -> (3, -1) (Death)\n  LEFT -> (2, 0)\n  RIGHT -> (4, 0)\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 1:**\n\n1. **Safety Check (My moves from (1, 1)):**\n   * UP (1, 2): Safe.\n   * DOWN (1, 0): Safe.\n   * LEFT (0, 1): Safe.\n   * RIGHT (2, 1): Safe. (It's an apple, not a snake. Hitting an apple just grows you.)\n\n2. **Apple Acquisition (Target: (2, 1)):**\n   * Moving RIGHT to (2, 1) is an immediate apple grab. If Snake #0 does not also move to (2, 1), I win the race for this apple.\n   * Could Snake #0 move to (2, 1)?\n     * Snake #0 is at (3, 0). To reach (2, 1), Snake #0 must move: LEFT to (2, 0), and then UP to (2, 1). This requires two diagonal moves, or one step LEFT and one step UP in the same turn, which is impossible.\n     * Snake #0's safest way to start moving towards (2, 1) is LEFT to (2, 0) or UP to (3, 1).\n\n3. **Collision Risk:**\n   * I move RIGHT to (2, 1).\n   * Snake #0 moves:\n     * UP to (3, 1): No collision.\n     * LEFT to (2, 0): No collision.\n     * RIGHT to (4, 0): No collision.\n\n   * There is no scenario where moving RIGHT to (2, 1) results in a collision this turn, as (2, 1) is not adjacent to any of Snake #0's possible destination squares (which are (3, 1), (2, 0), or (4, 0)).\n\n4. **Optimal Move:**\n   Moving RIGHT guarantees eating the apple at (2, 1), gaining 1 point and growing to length 2. This is the best move.\n\n**Future Strategy Note (T2 onwards):**\nAfter taking (2, 1), my head will be at (2, 1) and my body will be at (1, 1). Snake #0 will be at (3, 1), (2, 0), or (4, 0).\nThe next closest apples are (5, 3) and (7, 3).\nFrom (2, 1), I should consider moving towards (5, 3). This means moving RIGHT/UP.\nIf Snake #0 moved LEFT to (2, 0), they are trapped below me.\nIf Snake #0 moved UP to (3, 1), they are positioned slightly better for (5, 3).\n\nI should aim to move UP to (2, 2) or RIGHT to (3, 1) if Snake 0 is not there. Since Snake #0 might move to (3, 1), moving UP to (2, 2) is safer for T2.\n\nFinal decision for T1: Move RIGHT to secure the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Simultaneous head-on collision risk. **High Risk/Potential Death.**\n   * **LEFT (1, 1):** This is my body (tail segment). Moving backwards results in death. **DEATH.**\n   * **RIGHT (3, 1):** Safe.\n\n   *Remaining Safe Moves: UP (2, 2), RIGHT (3, 1).*\n\n2. **Analyzing Conflict with Snake #0 at (2, 0):**\n   Snake #0 is L=1, facing the pressure of the bottom wall.\n   Possible moves for Snake #0 from (2, 0):\n   * UP (2, 1): Head-on collision with me if I move DOWN. But I am moving to (x, y) = (2, 1) and Snake 0 is at (2, 0). If Snake 0 moves UP, it moves into my current position (2, 1). If I move UP (2, 2) or RIGHT (3, 1), Snake 0 moving UP is safe for me, but Snake 0 dies if it moves into my stationary body (1, 1). Wait, Snake 0 moving UP takes it to my *current* head position (2, 1). Since my head moves simultaneously, if I move to (2, 2) and Snake 0 moves to (2, 1), Snake 0 moves into the cell that was previously occupied by my head, which is now empty. **Safe for Snake 0.**\n   * LEFT (1, 0): Safe.\n   * RIGHT (3, 0): Safe.\n   * DOWN: Death.\n\n3. **Strategic Move Selection (Target (5, 3)):**\n   I need to move RIGHT and UP repeatedly.\n\n   * **Option A: RIGHT to (3, 1)**\n     * Pro: Directly towards the target (5, 3). Distance reduction: 1 (to 4).\n     * Pro: Safe from collision based on Snake #0's current position (2, 0). Snake #0 cannot reach (3, 1) in one turn.\n     * Con: Exposes (2, 1) for Snake #0 to potentially claim if they move UP.\n\n   * **Option B: UP to (2, 2)**\n     * Pro: Moves towards the target (5, 3), although slightly less efficient than RIGHT. Distance reduction: 1 (to 4).\n     * Pro: Keeps central column control.\n     * Pro: Safe.\n\n4. **Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:**\n   Both moves reduce the distance to (5, 3) to 4.\n   (5, 3) is (3 steps Right, 2 steps Up) from (2, 1).\n   If I choose RIGHT (3, 1), next turn I would likely choose RIGHT or UP.\n   If I choose UP (2, 2), next turn I would likely choose RIGHT or UP.\n\n   Let's consider Snake #0's optimal move. Snake #0 must move LEFT, UP, or RIGHT. To chase the apple (5, 3), Snake #0 needs to move RIGHT and UP.\n   * If Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 1), they move towards the apple, but leave the bottom row.\n   * If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 0), they slightly close the horizontal gap.\n\n   If I move RIGHT to (3, 1):\n   * If Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 1), Snake 0 is still further from (5, 3). (Manhattan 5).\n   * If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 0), Snake 0 is only 1 step behind me horizontally. (Manhattan 5).\n\n   If I move UP to (2, 2):\n   * If Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 1), Snake 0 is now directly under me. (Manhattan 4 for both of us!). This puts us in a head-to-head race setup.\n   * If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 0), Snake 0 is further away. (Manhattan 6).\n\n   Moving **RIGHT** seems slightly superior as it maintains a small lead in distance reduction and avoids setting up a direct vertical blockage race where Snake #0 could gain equal footing immediately. By moving to (3, 1), I secure a path along y=1, while Snake #0 must break out by moving UP to contest the center.\n\n5. **Minor Consideration: Tail Location.**\n   My tail is at (1, 1). If I move RIGHT (3, 1), my tail moves to (2, 1).\n   If I move UP (2, 2), my tail moves to (2, 1). (This is true for any safe move since I am L=2).\n   This doesn't change the safety or efficiency calculations.\n\nI choose R to maintain the horizontal push towards (5, 3).\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note (T3 onwards):**\nHead will be at (3, 1). Body/Tail at (2, 1). Target (5, 3).\nRequired moves: 2 R, 2 U.\nT3 Plan: Look to move UP or RIGHT, preferably avoiding Snake #0's likely location (likely (2, 1) or (3, 0)).\nRIGHT",
