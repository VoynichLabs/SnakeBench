My main task is to get to that apple... Hmm, actually, moving up would put me in a favorable position relative to it, and moving right would just waste a turn really, because I'm not in danger of going out of bounds or crashing into the wall.\n\nYou know what? I think I'll move up and move east as well next turn, so I can incorporate both moving towards the apple and make some space between myself and the enemy snake at (3, 4) that's to my west.\n\nI'll think about saying to myself: 'Maintain the right and up orientation' as I move east and up to put myself in a better position to take advantage of the #appendices just far out to the left.

Apples are at (4, 3), (0, 6), (8, 9), (5, 2), (9, 2).\n\nMy last move was RIGHT, which means I am currently positioned with the intention of moving right. However, the board has been updated by the game and my head is now at (7,7).\n\nThe enemy snake is a major concern. It's close and its next move is unpredictable. I need to prioritize avoidance. The apple at (8, 9) is close and moving right seems natural following my previous, now incorrect, intention. However, to avoid moving directly into Snake 1 which is at (8,8) I amend my plan.\n\nThe apple at (0, 6) is also an option, and it's actually closer than (8, 9). Going LEFT towards (0,6) would give me an apple and allow me to move away from the enemy. Given Snake 1's position, I won't risk moving RIGHT and potentially colliding with it.\n\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",
