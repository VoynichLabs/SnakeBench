          "rationale": "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board State:**\n    *   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (2, 2). Body: None. Since I have no body, I cannot hit myself (except by moving out of bounds). I can move into my previous position without dying, as there is no body segment there.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (9, 1). Body: None.\n    *   **Apples:** There are many apples available on the board.\n    *   **Coordinates:** (0,0) is bottom-left, (9,9) is top-right.\n    *   **Turn:** 0/150. Game just started.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves from (2, 2):**\n    *   **UP (to 2, 3):** Valid coordinate. No obstacles. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (to 2, 1):** Valid coordinate. No obstacles. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (to 1, 2):** Valid coordinate. No obstacles. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 3, 2):** Valid coordinate. No obstacles. Safe.\n\n    All 4 moves are immediately safe.\n\n3.  **Strategic Considerations:**\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** I need to look for the closest apples.\n        *   Apple at (6, 0) is at y=0. My current y=2. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) puts me closer to the bottom edge and the apple at (6,0). However, (6,0) is 4 units away in X and 2 units away in Y (total 6 moves). To get there, I'd have to navigate across the board.\n        *   Apple at (1, 7) is at y=7. Moving UP towards it is a longer distance (5 units Y, 1 unit X).\n        *   Apple at (3, 7) is also high up.\n        *   Apple at (4, 3) is closer in Y (1 unit up) and X (2 units right). Distance ~3 moves.\n    *   **Enemy Position:** Enemy is at (9, 1), far right side, low y. They are not an immediate threat.\n    *   **Board Control:**\n        *   Moving UP towards the center/top (where apples like (4,3), (4,5), (3,7) are) seems promising.\n        *   Moving DOWN towards (6,0) or (7,0) is also an option, but the bottom row has fewer apples than the center.\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (3,2) opens up access to the cluster of apples at (4,3), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,9).\n        *   Moving LEFT to (1,2) moves me towards the edge and apples at (1,7).\n\n    *   **Safety and Future Moves:**\n        *   Since I have no body, I don't need to worry about trapping myself immediately.\n        *   The cluster of apples in the middle-right of the board (x=3 to 6, y=3 to 7) is very dense. This is the most valuable area to control.\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) positions me directly below this cluster (specifically under the apple at (4, 3)). From (3, 2), I can go UP to (3, 3) or RIGHT to (4, 2) and then UP.\n        *   Moving UP to (2, 3) or (2, 4) is also reasonable to enter the vertical corridor near the left side, but the density of apples to the right is higher.\n\n    *   **Comparing (3, 2) vs (2, 3):**\n        *   (3, 2) is one step right. It keeps me relatively central.\n        *   (2, 3) is one step up.\n        *   The apple at (4, 3) is very tempting. To get there from (2, 2), I need to move Right (to 3,2) then Right (to 4,2) then Up (to 4,3). Or Right (to 3,2) then Up (to 3,3) then Right (to 4,3).\n        *   If I move UP to (2,3), I am still 2 steps away from (4,3).\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (3,2) puts me in a better position to pivot to either the (4,3) apple or the (1,7) apple.\n\n    *   **Decision:** I will move RIGHT to (3, 2). This moves me closer to the dense apple cluster in the center-right of the board (apples at 4,3; 4,5; 5,6; 6,5; 6,8; etc.) and keeps my options open to move Up or Right next turn. It is also closer to the apple at (6,0) if I decide to go down later, compared to moving Up to (2,3).\n\n4.  **Final Check:**\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) is on the board.\n    *   No snake bodies are at (3, 2).\n    *   Enemy is far away.\n    *   This move gains immediate access to the densest part of the board.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nMove towards the apple at (4, 3). From (3, 2), the plan is to move UP to (3, 3) or RIGHT to (4, 2), depending on safety and enemy movement, to set up for the apple at (4, 3) or (4, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

My snake (ID 1) starts at (3, 2) and the enemy snake (ID 0) starts at (9, 2).\n\n**Analysis of Turn 1:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Threats:**\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0 (Head: 9, 2):** The enemy is 6 units away horizontally. They cannot reach me on turn 1.\n    *   **Obstacles:** My body is empty. The board has walls at x=0-9, y=0-9.\n    *   **Potential Collisions:** Since we move simultaneously, I must predict the enemy's move. The enemy is at (9, 2). The most dangerous move for me is if the enemy moves LEFT to (8, 2) and I move RIGHT to (4, 2), or vice versa. This is unlikely to be an immediate threat on turn 1, but I should be wary of crossing their path.\n\n2.  **Apple Strategy:**\n    *   There is a dense cluster of apples in the central-right area of the board (x=4 to 6, y=3 to 9). Controlling this area is crucial for long-term survival and scoring.\n    *   My current position (3, 2) is just below this cluster.\n    *   **Option A (Right to 4, 2):** Moves me directly into the column under the apple at (4, 3). This is the most direct route to the densest cluster. It also blocks the enemy (at 9,2) from easily accessing the left side of the board if they decide to move up.\n    *   **Option B (Up to 3, 3):** Moves me into the vertical corridor. This is also safe and provides access to apples at (3, 7) and (4, 5)/ (4, 6).\n    *   **Option C (Down to 3, 1):** Moves me towards the bottom edge and apples at (6, 0) and (7, 0). While safe, the bottom is less dense than the center.\n    *   **Option D (Left to 2, 2):** Moves me away from the dense cluster and towards the left edge. Less optimal.\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n    *   Moving **RIGHT to (4, 2)** is the strongest move. It positions me immediately adjacent to the apple at (4, 3) and places me in the heart of the board's resource zone. It also keeps my path open to move Up, Right, or Down next turn.\n    *   I must ensure I don't move into the enemy if they move Left. However, given the distance, this is extremely unlikely. Even if the enemy moves Left to (8, 2), there is still a gap.\n    *   I will move RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (4, 3) next turn. Once eaten, navigate through the cluster at (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 8) to grow quickly. Monitor the enemy at (9, 2) to ensure they don't flank me from the right side.\n\nRIGHT",

Their body is at (9, 2).\n    *   Apples are abundant, particularly in the central region.\n\n2.  **Immediate Threats:**\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0:** Located at (9, 3). The distance is significant. They are unlikely to threaten my immediate vicinity this turn unless they move specifically to intercept a predicted path, which is speculative.\n    *   **Board Constraints:** I am at (4, 2). The board is 10x10. Coordinates (0,0) to (9,9).\n    *   **My Potential Moves:**\n        *   UP to (4, 3): There is an apple here.\n        *   RIGHT to (5, 2): Empty.\n        *   DOWN to (4, 1): Empty.\n        *   LEFT to (3, 2): Empty (and I came from here, so entering my own tail is safe as it will move away).\n\n3.  **Evaluating Moves:**\n    *   **UP (to 4, 3):** This move lands on an apple. Eating an apple increases my length and score. The cell (4, 3) is safe (no snake bodies there). After eating, my body will extend to (4, 2). This keeps my options open to move UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN next turn. Moving UP also centers me vertically in the board, closer to the dense apple cluster at (5, 6), (6, 5), etc. This is a strong tactical move.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 5, 2):** This moves toward the right side of the board. While safe, it bypasses an immediate apple and moves closer to the enemy's starting column. It does not immediately improve my score.\n    *   **DOWN (to 4, 1):** Moves toward the bottom edge. Safe, but less optimal than moving toward the central cluster.\n    *   **LEFT (to 3, 2):** Moves away from the central cluster. Safe, but retreats from resource-rich areas.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   The move **UP** is the optimal choice. It secures an apple immediately (turning score 0 -> 1), safely occupies an empty cell, and positions me to enter the central apple cluster next turn.\n    *   I must ensure the enemy does not collide with me. The enemy is at (9, 3). If they move LEFT to (8, 3), (7, 3), etc., they are still far away. Collision is impossible this turn. If they moved DOWN to (9, 2), they would hit their own tail (which will move), but that is their problem. They cannot reach (4, 3).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (4, 3). Then, navigate to the dense cluster at (5, 6) or (6, 5). Monitor the enemy snake's position relative to the right edge to prevent flanking. Avoid getting trapped in the corners.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

This is a suicidal move. **LEFT is UNSAFE.**\n- **Enemy Movement:**\n  - The enemy is at (8, 4).\n  - **Up (8, 5):** Safe. No obstacles.\n  - **Down (8, 3):** Currently empty. Moving here brings the enemy closer to the bottom-left area where I am.\n  - **Left (7, 4):** Currently empty. This is a strong move towards the center apples (6, 5).\n  - **Right (9, 4):** Hits own body at (9, 4). Enemy dies. Enemy won't choose this.\n- **Head-on Collision Risk:**\n  - If I move **UP** to (5, 4), and the enemy moves **LEFT** to (7, 4), we are safe.\n  - If I move **RIGHT** to (6, 3), and the enemy moves **LEFT** to (7, 4), we are safe.\n  - If I move **DOWN** to (5, 2), and the enemy moves **LEFT** to (7, 4), we are safe.\n  - The only dangerous coincidence would be if I move into a cell the enemy is already in or moves into simultaneously. Currently, the enemy is at (8, 4).\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 4):**\n    - Safe. Empty.\n    - **Pros:** Gets me closer to the dense apple cluster at (5, 6) and (6, 5). Position (5, 4) is a strong central hub.\n    - **Cons:** None immediate.\n\n2.  **RIGHT (to 6, 3):**\n    - Safe. Empty.\n    - **Pros:** I collect the **Apple at (6, 3)** immediately. Score becomes 3. Length becomes 4. Prevents enemy from possibly eating it later (though enemy is far away).\n    - **Cons:** Slightly moves me away from the top-right apples, but (6, 3) is a good defensive position near the center-left.\n\n3.  **DOWN (to 5, 2):**\n    - Safe. Empty.\n    - **Pros:** None really. Moves me away from all apples. (5, 2) is close to the bottom wall.\n\n**Decision:**\n- **UP** is a safe move towards the big apple cluster.\n- **RIGHT** is a safe move that guarantees an apple immediately.\n- **DOWN** is a safe but suboptimal move.\n\nComparing **UP** vs **RIGHT**:\n- If I go **RIGHT**, I get +1 apple immediately. The nearest apple then is (5, 6) or (5, 1).\n- If I go **UP**, I don't get an apple immediately, but I am positioned to branch out to (5, 6), (6, 5), or (4, 5).\n- However, the **Apple at (6, 3)** is right there. Taking it ensures I don't lose it to a random enemy movement later (though unlikely given distance).\n- Furthermore, being at (6, 3) keeps me centrally located to pivot to the apples at (5, 6) or drop down to (6, 0).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEating the apple is the most immediate positive outcome. It increases my score to 3, matching the enemy, and increases my length, which might be useful later. The position (6, 3) is good.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (6, 3). From (6, 3), aim for the apple at (5, 6) or the cluster near the center-right. Monitor the enemy (8, 4); if they go Left towards the center, I need to be careful about engaging in the center area. If they go Up, I have time to clear the apples near the center-left (5, 6), (4, 6), (6, 5).\n\n**Move Selection:**\nI will move **RIGHT** to (6, 3) to eat the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Moves me toward the nearby high-value cluster around (6,5),(5,6),(4,5),(4,6).\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- Enemy head at (5,3) cannot move into its own body at (4,3). Its obvious attractive move is RIGHT to (6,3) (an apple) or UP to (5,4). None of those moves would collide with me if I go LEFT to (7,4) this turn. There is no realistic simultaneous head-on risk to (7,4).\n\nChoice rationale:\n- RIGHT is illegal. UP and DOWN are safe but less direct toward the dense cluster of apples on the left side of the board.\n- LEFT advances toward multiple nearby apples while increasing distance from the board edge and the cramped right-side body. It preserves multiple escape options (I can go UP or DOWN from (7,4) next turn) and keeps me competitive for the cluster where I can rack up apples.\n- I will avoid chopping off my own retreat path; after moving LEFT I'll prefer routes that keep at least two exits open and watch the enemy's moves toward (6,3).\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Move into the apple cluster around x=4..6,y=4..6 to collect several apples.\n- Avoid head-on engagement; if the enemy contests (6,3) or (5,4) I will prioritize surrounding cluster apples rather than immediate conflict.\n- Preserve escape lanes by not filling narrow corridors; prefer moving through open spaces and stay aware of tail movement when I grow.\n\nLEFT",

No, (7, 3) is adjacent to me. If I stay still? No, I move.\n  - **Up (7, 5):** Moves towards the apple cluster at (6, 5), (5, 6).\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n1.  **UP (to 6, 4):**\n    - **High Risk:** The enemy is at (7, 4). If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (6, 4), we collide and both die. Since the enemy wants apples (6, 5 is close), moving Left is a valid path. I cannot gamble on the enemy not moving Left.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 2):**\n    - **Safe:** Empty. (6, 2) is empty.\n    - **Pros:** Moves me away from the enemy and the immediate head-on collision risk at (6, 4).\n    - **Cons:** Moves me away from the dense apple cluster (5, 6), (6, 5).\n3.  **RIGHT (to 7, 3):**\n    - **Safe:** Empty.\n    - **Pros:** Keeps me relatively central.\n    - **Cons:** Puts me directly south of the enemy at (7, 4).

No, we can't occupy the same square.\n    - However, (7, 3) is currently empty. The enemy moving **DOWN** to (7, 3) would be a valid move for them.\n    - If I move **RIGHT** to (7, 3) and Enemy moves **DOWN** to (7, 3), we collide. This is a risk.\n    - If I move **RIGHT** to (7, 3) and Enemy moves **LEFT** to (6, 4), we are safe.\n\n**Decision:**\nComparing **UP** vs **DOWN** vs **RIGHT**:\n- **UP** is dangerous because the enemy at (7, 4) moving **LEFT** (a logical move towards the central apples) kills us both.\n- **RIGHT** is risky because the enemy at (7, 4) moving **DOWN** (a possible move to avoid me or change direction) kills us both.\n- **DOWN** is safe. The space (6, 2) is empty, and the enemy cannot reach (6, 2) in one turn from (7, 4). It is also a defensive move that moves me away from the enemy's likely path (center/up). While it moves away from the immediate apple cluster, survival is paramount. Once safe, I can navigate to the apples at (5, 1), (6, 0), or loop back up.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove **DOWN** to (6, 2) to avoid immediate head-on collision risks with the enemy at (7, 4). From (6, 2), I can assess the enemy's next move and target the lower apples (6, 0), (7, 1) or re-engage the center if the enemy moves away.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

This allows a follow-up to (5,1).\n*   **RIGHT (7,2):** Moves towards the apple at (7,1). (7,2) is currently empty. This allows a follow-up to (7,1).\n*   **DOWN (6,1):** Moves directly adjacent to the apple at (6,0). (6,1) is currently empty. This allows a follow-up to (6,0).\n    *   *Risk check for DOWN:* The enemy is at (7,5). If the enemy moves UP to (7,6) or RIGHT to (8,5), they are moving away from me. I am safe from the enemy.\n    *   *Note:* I previously identified (6,2) as the tail of the enemy? No, the board shows enemy head at (7,5) and body starting at (7,4). The text description confirms: \"Snake #0 - Head: (7, 5), Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]\". My current position (6,2) is safe.\n    *   Looking at the provided board state: Row 2 shows ` . A . . . . 1 . . . ` at index 6. This confirms (6,2) is my head. The apple at (5,1) is reachable.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **LEFT** to **(5, 2)**.\n*   **Safety:** The enemy cannot hit me. (5,2) is empty.\n*   **Opportunity:** This moves me adjacent to the apple at (5, 1) and near the apple at (4, 5) / (5, 6) cluster.\n*   **Alternative (DOWN):** Moving DOWN to (6,1) sets me up for the apple at (6,0). However, the apple at (5,1) is also adjacent. Moving LEFT gives me flexibility. If I go LEFT to (5,2), I can go to (5,1) or (4,1) or (4,2). If I go DOWN to (6,1), I am bottlenecked slightly by the wall and my own tail (currently at 5,3, 6,3).\n*   **Alternative (RIGHT):** (7,2) is a good spot, but the immediate apples (7,1) and (7,0) are slightly further in a direct line than the (5,1) apple is from (5,2).\n*   **Choice:** Moving **LEFT** to **(5, 2)** positions me directly next to the apple at (5, 1). This is the most efficient immediate apple grab.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nMove LEFT to (5, 2). On Turn 7, move to (5, 1) to eat the apple and grow. Monitor the enemy's movement (likely UP to 7,6) and prepare to navigate towards the central apple cluster (4,5, 5,6, 6,5) while keeping the bottom-right apples (7,0, 7,1) as an alternative route.\n\nLEFT",

The text shows ` . . . . A . T . . . ` at index 5? No, looking closer at the text board provided in the prompt:\n      Row 3: ` . . . . A . T . . . ` (Indices 0-9). Index 5 is `.`. Wait, the character at index 5 is `.`.\n      Actually, looking at the \"Last Rationale\" from Turn 6, it stated: \"My body is [(6, 3), (5, 3)]\". The prompt's \"Your snake\" section says \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\".\n      *Discrepancy Check:* The prompt says \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (5, 2), Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\". This implies I moved LEFT to (5, 2), and the old head (6, 2) is now the first body segment. The tail is (6, 3). (5, 3) is empty.\n    - **DOWN to (5, 1):** Check board row 1. Text: ` . . . . . A .

Empty.\n    - **RIGHT to (6, 2):** This is currently my own body segment (first segment after head). **UNSAFE.**\n\n2.  **Enemy Snake #0 (at 6, 5):**\n    - **Enemy Body:** (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4).\n    - **Enemy Possible Moves:**\n        - **UP (6, 6):** Board row 6, index 6 is `.` (Row 6: ` . . . .

A . 0 T . . `). Safe.\n        - **RIGHT (7, 5):** This is currently occupied by the enemy's own body. **UNSAFE.**\n    - **Conclusion:** Enemy can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n3.  **Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Movement):**\n    - My Safe Moves: UP (5,3), DOWN (5,1), LEFT (4,2).\n    - Enemy Safe Destinations: (6,6), (6,4), (5,5).\n    - **Comparison:**\n        - My UP (5,3) vs Enemy (6,6), (6,4), (5,5): No overlap.\n        - My DOWN (5,1) vs Enemy (6,6), (6,4), (5,5): No overlap.\n        - My LEFT (4,2) vs Enemy (6,6), (6,4), (5,5): No overlap.\n    - **Conclusion:** No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Strategic Planning:**\n- **UP (5, 3):** Moves towards the apple at (5, 4) or (4, 5). However, the enemy is currently at (6, 5). If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 5), they will be right next to me. If I go UP to (5, 3), I am moving toward the center where the enemy is. This might be risky in subsequent turns if the enemy chases.\n- **LEFT (4, 2):** Moves towards the apple at (4, 3) (which is on the board) and (1, 2). This moves me away from the enemy at (6, 5). However, (4, 3) is an apple. This is a safe path.\n- **DOWN (5, 1):** Moves towards the apple at (6, 0) and (5, 1) itself. (5, 1) is currently empty, but there is an apple at (6, 0) and (7, 0). This moves me to the bottom edge. This is a safe path and keeps me away from the enemy.\n\n**Decision:**\nI want to avoid the central cluster where the enemy is currently located (6, 5) and where apples are clustered (4,5, 5,6). The enemy has more apples (4 vs 2) and is winning. I should focus on isolated apples.\n- The apple at (4, 3) is reachable via LEFT.\n- The apples at (5, 1) and (6, 0) are reachable via DOWN.\n- The apple at (4, 3) is on the way to the apple at (1, 2). The apple at (5, 1) leads to a dead end (wall at y=0).\n\nMoving **LEFT** to **(4, 2)** is the best choice. It moves me closer to the apple at (4, 3) and keeps me generally away from the enemy. If the enemy moves to the center, I am on the left flank. If the enemy moves left, I will deal with it next turn, but for now, (4, 2) is safe and productive.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nMove LEFT to (4, 2). Prepare to move to (4, 3) to eat the apple. Monitor the enemy's movement towards the central apples (5,6) or (6,5). If the enemy moves left aggressively, I will need to retreat or pivot towards (1, 2).\n\nLEFT",

The coordinate (4, 3) is distinct from all of the Enemy's possible destinations ((5, 6), (5, 4), (4, 5)). There is no risk of head-on collision.\n*   **Option LEFT (3, 2):** Moves into empty space. While safe, it moves away from the apple at (4, 3).\n*   **Option DOWN (4, 1):** Moves into empty space. Moves away from the apple at (4, 3).\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe apple at (4, 3) is adjacent to my head. Moving **UP** guarantees I eat the apple, grow longer, and increase my score (2 -> 3). The enemy snake is currently at (5, 5). Their immediate options are (5, 6), (5, 4), or (4, 5). My move to (4, 3) does not intersect with any of these squares. Furthermore, (4, 3) is not currently occupied by the enemy's body. I am moving away from the enemy's current position (distance increases from $\\sqrt{(5-4)^2 + (5-2)^2} = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16$ to $\\sqrt{(5-4)^2 + (5-3)^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.24$? No, wait. If enemy stays at 5,5, distance to 4,3 is $\\sqrt{5}$. Distance to 4,2 is $\\sqrt{5}$. Distance to 3,2 is $\\sqrt{6}$. Moving UP keeps me relatively close but secures food. However, securing the apple is the priority.\n\n**Plan:**\nEat the apple at (4, 3). This grows my snake and prepares me to target the apple at (1, 2) or (4, 5) in subsequent turns. I will maintain a safe distance from the enemy.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 6):** Row 6 shows `. . . . A 0 . . . .`. At index 6, it is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n*   **Option UP (4, 4):** Moves to empty space. Increases distance from the enemy (currently at 5,6). This is a safe, defensive move to maintain space and avoid the enemy's likely path towards apples on the left or upper rows.\n*   **Option LEFT (3, 3):** Moves to an apple. However, this moves me toward the enemy's possible path (4,6) and narrows my escape routes (closer to the wall at x=0). The enemy is already leading 5-3 in apples, so taking risky moves to catch up is tempting but dangerous.\n*   **Option RIGHT (5, 3):** Moves to empty space. This moves closer to the enemy (distance decreases) and potentially into a collision zone if the enemy moves DOWN (which is unsafe for them, so they likely won't) or if they block future paths.\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nThe enemy is at (5, 6) and has access to apples at (4, 6) and (5, 7). My current head is at (4, 3). Moving **UP** to (4, 4) keeps me centered and away from the immediate conflict. While the apple at (3, 3) is tempting, moving LEFT reduces my maneuverability and brings me closer to the enemy's potential expansion area. Moving UP allows me to pivot to the apple at (1, 2) or (4, 5) in subsequent turns while maintaining a safe buffer. The enemy cannot move DOWN into (5, 5) because my body is there, so their movement is restricted to UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. My move UP to (4, 4) does not threaten them, and they do not threaten me.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (4, 4). This secures a safe position and keeps options open for the apples at (1, 2) or (4, 5). I will continue to avoid direct confrontation and wait for the enemy to overextend.\n\n**END RATIONALE**",

Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 4)\n*   **My Body:** [(4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)] (From Turn 9 Rationale)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 6) (Based on \"START LAST MOVE PICK: UP\" and Turn 9 Rationale indicating enemy at 5,6)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4)] (Assumed, as I haven't seen the new turn's full state yet)\n*   **Apples:** (4, 5) is directly between me and the enemy.\n\n**2. Move Safety Check:**\n*   **UP (4, 5):** Contains an apple. The enemy is at (4, 6). If I go UP to (4, 5) and the enemy goes DOWN to (4, 5), we collide and both die. The enemy might be distracted by other apples, but this is a risk.\n*   **DOWN (4, 3):** My body is at (4, 3). Unsafe.\n*   **LEFT (3, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**3. Strategic Reasoning:**\nThe enemy is at (4, 6), likely eyeing the apple at (4, 5) or (5, 7). Moving UP to (4, 5) creates a direct confrontation over the apple. While it might be possible to snatch it, if the enemy chooses UP to (4, 7) or RIGHT to (5, 6), they leave the apple for me. However, if they choose DOWN, we die. Given the score is 3 vs 6, a head-on collision is unfavorable because it resets my progress to zero while the enemy retains their lead if we die simultaneously (or simply ends the game if I die).\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (3, 4) is the safer play. It keeps me alive and avoids the immediate conflict. The apple at (4, 5) is still accessible next turn if the enemy doesn't take it. Moving LEFT also keeps my path open towards the cluster of apples on the left side of the board (e.g., (1, 2), (3, 3), (1, 7)). This preserves my life and keeps future options open.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nAvoiding the head-on collision at (4, 5) is the priority. Moving LEFT is safe and maintains strategic flexibility.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy can move UP to (4,5) this turn; if both heads move into (4,5) we both die (head-on). That would end the game and I would win on apples (6 vs 3), but I should not rely on forcing a mutual death when I can continue collecting safely. Taking (4,5) is therefore risky (likely contested).\n- UP -> (4,7): empty and safe. Keeps multiple exits (4,8), (3,7), (5,7) and gives good access to the cluster of apples above (3,7),(5,7),(6,8),(5,9),(7,7). Avoids an immediate head-on with the enemy.\n- LEFT -> (3,6): empty and safe. It also heads toward (3,7) but has slightly fewer immediate exits than UP.\n\nChoice and reasoning:\n- I will avoid DOWN because it has a high probability of a head-on with the enemy at (4,4) contesting the same apple. I prefer staying alive and maintaining options.\n- Between UP and LEFT, UP is best: it keeps three good follow-up choices, keeps me central to multiple apple clusters, and reduces the chance of getting boxed in by the enemy moving up the column.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP now to (4,7).

Notable nearby apples:\n        *   (3, 7) - Up-Left (Distance 4)\n        *   (4, 5) - Up (Distance 2, but blocked by enemy path)\n        *   (2, 3) - Left (Distance 1)\n        *   (1, 2) - Left (Distance 2)\n\n2.  **Safety Analysis**:\n    *   **UP (3, 5)**: The cell (3, 5) is empty. It is not an apple. The enemy is at (4, 7). The enemy cannot reach (3, 5) in one move. Safe from immediate collision.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 3)**: The cell (3, 3) is empty (indicated by the board row 3, column 3 being '.'). Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 4)**: The cell (2, 4) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 4)**: This is my own body segment. **Unsafe**.\n\n3.  **Strategic Analysis**:\n    *   **Avoiding Risk**: My last move was LEFT. Moving UP to (3, 5) is a safe neutral move. It keeps me away from the enemy's direct path and maintains distance.\n    *   **Apple Potential**:\n        *   **Targeting (3, 7)**: Moving UP to (3, 5) positions me to reach (3, 7) in two more moves (3,6 -> 3,7). This apple is not immediately contested by the enemy.\n        *   **Targeting (2, 3)**: Moving DOWN to (3, 3) would place me adjacent to (2, 3). However, moving DOWN brings me closer to my own tail (4, 2), potentially reducing mobility. Also, (2, 3) is further away from the enemy's current position, which is generally safer for gathering.\n    *   **Enemy Interaction**: The enemy is at (4, 7). If I go UP, I am moving slightly closer to the enemy but opening a path to the top-left area. The enemy seems to be moving somewhat erratically or focused on other apples (e.g., they moved to 4,7 which isn't an apple). They are currently blocked from moving LEFT or DOWN (unless they have body clearance).\n\n4.  **Decision**:\n    *   I have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n    *   Moving LEFT to (2, 4) moves me toward the (2, 3) apple, but also moves me away from the (3, 7) cluster.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (3, 3) moves me toward (2, 3) but traps me slightly between the wall and my body tail.\n    *   Moving UP to (3, 5) is the most flexible. It keeps my vertical range open and sets up a path to the apple at (3, 7). It also keeps distance from the enemy at (4, 7).\n\n    Let's verify the board state again. The board shows:\n    Row 4 (y=4): ` . . . 1 T . . T . . `\n    My head is at 3,4.\n    Row 5 (y=5): ` . . . . A T T T . . `\n    (3, 5) is empty.\n    Row 6 (y=6): ` . . . . T T . . . . `\n    Row 7 (y=7): ` . A . A 0 A . A . . `\n    Enemy is at (4, 7). Apple at (3, 7).\n\n    Moving UP puts me at (3, 5). I am safe.\n\n    **Long-term Plan**: Move UP to (3, 5) to position for the apple at (3, 7). This keeps me away from the enemy's current location and avoids the tight space near my tail. If the enemy moves aggressively towards the top-left, I can pivot to the apples at (1, 2) or (2, 3). If the enemy stays near the center, I secure the (3, 7) apple.\n\nUP",

Eating is good, but I must avoid creating a cramped shape or setting up a head-on with the enemy. The enemy head is at (3,4) and cannot contest either (3,7) or (5,7) this turn, so immediate head-on is not a concern.\n- RIGHT (5,7) is slightly preferable because it keeps me aimed at the dense apple cluster to the northeast: (6,8), (5,9), (7,7). From (5,7) I will have clear follow-up moves: RIGHT to (6,7) then up to (6,8) or up to (5,8) then (5,9). LEFT to (4,7) would be backward/illegal, and DOWN to (5,6) would collide with my body; so I need to plan to move outward (up/right) after eating. That is fine \u2014 those exits are available.\n- UP (4,8) is the safest non-growing option and keeps maximal flexibility, but foregoing an easy apple wastes tempo when I am comfortably ahead and there is no immediate enemy contest.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- RIGHT now to (5,7) and eat the apple.\n- Next turn go RIGHT to (6,7) or UP to (5,8) depending on enemy moves, then collect (6,8) and (5,9)/ (7,7) cluster while avoiding moving down into the enemy's potential approach from the south.\n\nRIGHT",

It has apples at (6, 8) and (7, 8) nearby. It is currently head-to-head with me if it moves left. Specifically, if the enemy moves **LEFT** to (4, 7), and I move **RIGHT** to (4, 5), we are not colliding (distance is 2). However, if the enemy moves **LEFT** to (4, 7), and I move **DOWN** to (3, 4), we are safe.\n\nHowever, there is a specific danger: If the enemy moves **DOWN** to (5, 6), and I move **RIGHT** to (4, 5), I move into the apple at (4, 5). This is a likely move for me. But wait, (5, 6) is currently an enemy body segment. The enemy cannot move into its own body. So the enemy cannot move DOWN.\n\nLet's look at the map again:\nRow 7: ` . A . A 0 A . A . . `\nThe enemy is at (5, 7). The cells around it:\n*   Left (4, 7): Enemy body.\n*   Right (6, 7): Empty (visual check of board row 7, col 6 is '.').\n*   Up (5, 8): Empty (visual check of board row 8, col 5 is '.').\n*   Down (5, 6): Enemy body.\n\nThe enemy's valid moves are RIGHT (6, 7) or UP (5, 8).\n\nMy current position is (3, 5).\n*   Up (3, 6): Empty.\n*   Down (3, 4): My body.\n*   Left (2, 5): Empty.\n*   Right (4, 5): Apple.\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):**\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Goal: Moves toward the apple at (3, 7) and (6, 8).\n    *   Risk: If the enemy moves UP to (5, 8), the distance between us becomes small (Manhattan distance 4). If the enemy then moves LEFT next turn, it could cut me off. However, for *this* turn, it is safe.\n    *   Future: Leaves (4, 5) apple available.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):**\n    *   Safety: Safe (Apple is there, not a body).\n    *   Goal: Eat the apple. Grow to 4 apples.\n    *   Risk: This puts me directly below the enemy's potential path. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 7) and then decides to snake down, it might eventually threaten me. However, considering the immediate turn, this is a strong move to score.\n    *   Comparison: The enemy is 5 turns away from (4, 5) if it goes around (assuming it doesn't die). I am 1 turn away. I should take it.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):**\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Goal: Moves away from the enemy and toward the apple at (2, 3).\n    *   Risk: Gives up the guaranteed apple at (4, 5).\n\n4.  **DOWN to (3, 4):**\n    *   Safety: **Unsafe**. This is my current tail position (or adjacent to it?). My body is [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)]. (3, 4) is my second segment. Moving into my own body is death. Wait, let's check the body list again.\n    *   My Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)].\n    *   My Head is at (3, 5).\n    *   Moving DOWN goes to (3, 4). This is the first element of my body list.\n    *   **Result:** Moving DOWN is moving directly into my own body. This is a fatal move.\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nI must avoid moving DOWN.\nI have apples at (4, 5), (3, 7), (5, 9), etc.\n(4, 5) is the closest apple (distance 1).\nThe enemy is at (5, 7). It is not in a position to contest (4, 5) immediately.\nTaking the apple at (4, 5) increases my score and extends my body. This is the optimal move to close the score gap (Enemy 7 vs Me 3).\n\nIs there a trap?\nIf I eat (4, 5), my body will extend. The enemy is far enough away that I don't need to worry about a direct head-on collision this turn.\nThe enemy's valid moves are (6, 7) and (5, 8).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 5), I am safe from the enemy's current head position.\n\nLet's double check the board state provided:\nRow 5: ` . . . . A T T T . . `\nThis corresponds to y=5.\nx=4 is 'A'. x=5 is 'T' (Enemy body). x=6 is 'T'. x=7 is 'T'.\nSo (4, 5) is indeed an Apple.\n(4, 5) is not part of the enemy body.\n(4, 5) is not part of my body (My body is (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)).\n(4, 5) is within the board boundaries.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is safe and scores a point.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (4, 5) to grow. After growing, I will likely have a longer body. I need to be careful not to trap myself. The enemy is in the top right quadrant mostly, so moving right aligns me with the center, giving me flexibility to go up or down later.\n\nFinal check on backward movement: My head is at (3, 5). My previous position was (3, 4). Moving DOWN would be into my previous position, which is part of my body. Moving RIGHT is to (4, 5), which is new territory. Moving UP is to (3, 6). Moving LEFT is to (2, 5).\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\n**RIGHT**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Almost every adjacent square for them (4,6), (5,5), (4,4), (3,5) is currently occupied by either my body or their own body, so they have no safe move that doesn't run into a body segment this turn. I don't expect a head-on collision threat to the northeast apples I\u2019m targeting.\n\nAssessment of candidates:\n- DOWN (6,6) is the least attractive: it moves into a cramped area bordered by my own body, reducing escape options and making it harder to reach the rich apple cluster to the NE.\n- RIGHT (7,7) and UP (6,8) both immediately collect an apple and keep access to the NE cluster ((7,8),(8,8),(5,9), etc.). UP gives slightly more symmetric escape options (can go up or right afterward), while RIGHT puts my neck pointing west and slightly limits immediate left options.\n- The enemy is effectively contained and likely to die if forced into my body; I don\u2019t need to play overly defensive.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Take the NE apples while keeping exits open. Prefer moves that leave multiple follow-ups (UP now -> then choose among UP/RIGHT/LEFT depending on enemy tail movement). Avoid turning into my own cramped loop.\n\nMove: UP",

          "rationale": "**Reasoning for Turn 13:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Previous Turn:**\n    *   My last move was **RIGHT**.\n    *   My previous position was (3, 5). I moved to (4, 5).\n    *   The apple at (4, 5) was eaten.\n    *   I have now collected 4 apples. My length increases, meaning my tail (currently at (4, 3)) will not be vacated this turn.\n    *   New Body sequence: Head (4, 5), followed by (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3).\n\n2.  **Current State Analysis (Turn 13):**\n    *   **My Head:** (4, 5)\n    *   **My Body:** [(3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)] (Note: The tail at (4, 3) stays because I grew).\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head (6, 7), Body [(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5)].\n    *   **Apples:** The apple at (4, 5) is gone. Nearby apples: (3, 7), (5, 9), (6, 8).\n\n3.  **Evaluating Moves from (4, 5):**\n    *   **UP (4, 6):**\n        *   Location: (4, 6).\n        *   Is it safe? Enemy body is at (4, 7), (4, 6) is currently empty (visual check board row 6, col 4 is '.'). My body is at (3, 5), (3, 4), etc. (4, 6) is not in my body.\n        *   Is it backwards? No.\n        *   Is it on board? Yes.\n        *   **Risk Assessment:** The enemy head is at (6, 7). The enemy's valid moves are likely (5, 7) [Left] or (6, 8) [Up] or (7, 7) [Right]. (5, 6) is blocked by its own body. If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 7), we are separated by distance. If the enemy moves UP to (6, 8), distance is large. However, there is a specific danger: If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 7), it moves into a cell adjacent to my potential position. If I am at (4, 6) and enemy is at (5, 7), that's adjacent (diagonal), not a collision.\n        *   *Critical Check:* The cell (4, 6) is adjacent to the enemy's body at (4, 7). If the enemy moves DOWN to (5, 6), it dies on its own body. If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 7), no collision. If the enemy moves UP to (6, 8), no collision. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 7), no collision.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Moving UP to (4, 6) is safe from immediate collision.\n\n    *   **DOWN (4, 4):**\n        *   Location: (4, 4).\n        *   Is it safe? My body contains (4, 4). This is my third body segment.\n        *   **Result:** Moving DOWN kills me.\n\n    *   **LEFT (3, 5):**\n        *   Location: (3, 5).\n        *   Is it safe? My body contains (3, 5). This is my second body segment (the one directly behind my previous head position).\n        *   **Result:** Moving LEFT kills me (backwards/into self).\n\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 5):**\n        *   Location: (5, 5).\n        *   Is it safe? Enemy body is at (5, 5) (see enemy body list: ... (6, 5), (7, 5)? Wait, let's re-read enemy body carefully).\n        *   Enemy Body: [(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5)].\n        *   (5, 5) is the 5th element in the list. It is part of the enemy snake's body.\n        *   **Result:** Moving RIGHT kills me (into enemy body).\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   Moves DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are fatal.\n    *   The only safe move is **UP**.\n    *   Moving UP to (4, 6) keeps me alive. It moves me towards the apples at (3, 7), (5, 9), and (6, 8).\n    *   I must be wary that after moving UP, my body will extend (since I ate an apple last turn), creating a dense block around (3,5)-(4,5). I need to ensure I don't trap myself next turn.\n\n5.  **Final Check:**\n    *   Is (4, 6) empty? Yes (Board row 6, col 4 is '.').\n    *   Is (4, 6) off board? No.\n    *   Is (4, 6) occupied by a snake? No (My body is (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3); Enemy is at (6,7) and neighbors).\n    *   Is moving UP into my own tail? No.\n    *   Is there a head-on collision risk? Enemy is at (6, 7). If enemy moves LEFT to (5, 7) and I move UP to (4, 6), we are at Manhattan distance 2. Safe. If enemy moves UP to (6, 8), distance is larger. Safe.\n\n    *   **Path Planning:** I am at (4, 5). I ate the apple. I have a gap in the score (Enemy 7, Me 4). I need to catch up. The apple at (3, 7) is reachable. Moving UP puts me at (4, 6). From there, I can move LEFT to (3, 6) next turn, then UP to (3, 7) to eat the next apple. This is a clear path.\n\nUP",
