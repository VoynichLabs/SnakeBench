However, I should avoid moving toward **(6, 2)** just to be safe, since I don\u2019t want to risk head-on collisions in the future.\n4. **Avoiding My Own Body**:\n\t- My body segment is at **(5, 9)**, directly above me. I **cannot move up**, as this would cause me to collide with myself.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- **Primary Goal**: The closest apple **(5, 6)** is just one move **down** and avoids any immediate danger.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: I should not move **right** towards the enemy snake or move **up** (since that\u2019s already blocked by my body). Moving **left** doesn\u2019t move me closer to the apple and is therefore not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **DOWN**, to **(5, 7)**, which will bring me closer to the apple **without** running into any walls or my body. Once I collect the apple at **(5, 6)**, I will plan for the next step accordingly.\n\n### Next Move: **DOWN**.",

The apples are at **(5, 6)**, **(4, 3)**, **(7, 3)**, **(2, 5)**, and **(3, 3)**. The enemy snake (ID: 0) has its head at **(6, 2)** with no body.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Apples Locations and Accessibility**:\n\t- The closest apple is **(5, 6)**, which is just **to the right** (towards **x=5**) and **down** (towards **y=6**) from my current position. Since it\u2019s only one move away, this is my **primary target**.\n\t- The other apples are further away and will require more careful planning.\n2. **Boundaries**:\n\t- I\u2019m at **(5, 8)**, so I **cannot move up** anymore since I'm close to the top boundary. Moving **to the left** would take me away from the closest apple, so that\u2019s not ideal.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake is at **(6, 2)**, far enough that it doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat. However, I should avoid moving toward **(6, 2)** just to be safe, since I don\u2019t want to risk head-on collisions in the future.\n4. **Avoiding My Own Body**:\n\t- My body segment is at **(5, 9)**, directly above me. I **cannot move up**, as this would cause me to collide with myself.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- **Primary Goal**: The closest apple **(5, 6)** is just one move **down** and avoids any immediate danger.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: I should not move **right** towards the enemy snake or move **up** (since that\u2019s already blocked by my body). Moving **left** doesn\u2019t move me closer to the apple and is therefore not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **DOWN**, to **(5, 7)**, which will bring me closer to the apple **without** running into any walls or my body. Once I collect the apple at **(5, 6)**, I will plan for the next step accordingly.\n\n### Next Move: **DOWN**.",

It\u2019s not nearby right now, but it's at (6, 2), and I need to be cautious in case it moves up.\n\nStrategically, I think the best immediate move is to **move towards an apple** while avoiding any risk of collision with walls or the other snake.\n\n### Move evaluation:\n\n- **UP** is not an option since I\u2019m already at the top of the board.\n- **DOWN** would take me further away from the closest apples and closer to the enemy snake at (6, 2).\n- **LEFT** takes me closer to the apples (5, 6) and (5, 9), but there's no immediate risk.\n- **RIGHT** moves me away from the closest apples and closer to the edge of the board, which is unnecessary at the moment.\n\n#### **Final strategy**:\n\nMy current goal should be to move toward the closest apple at (5, 6). It\u2019s not directly below me, but I can get closer by going **LEFT**, which will also take me closer to several other apples without any immediate danger.\n\n**NEXT MOVE: LEFT**.",

I also have an enemy snake (ID 0) with its head at **(6, 2)** and no body.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Apples Locations & Accessibility**:\n\t- The closest apple is **(5, 6)**, which is just one move down from my current position.\n\t- Another apple, **(7, 3)**, is further away and will require me to move to the right and down.\n\t- The apples at **(2, 5)**, **(3, 3)**, and **(4, 3)** are also a few moves away but require me to move left, then down.\n2. **Boundary Considerations**:\n\t- I\u2019m at the top row (y = 9), so I **cannot move up**.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake's head is at **(6, 2)**, which is on the far opposite side of the board.

Since it\u2019s only one move away, this is my **primary target**.\n\t- The other apples are further away and will require more careful planning.\n2. **Boundaries**:\n\t- I\u2019m at **(5, 8)**, so I **cannot move up** anymore since I'm close to the top boundary. Moving **to the left** would take me away from the closest apple, so that\u2019s not ideal.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake is at **(6, 2)**, far enough that it doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat.

Moving **left** doesn\u2019t move me closer to the apple and is therefore not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **DOWN**, to **(5, 7)**, which will bring me closer to the apple **without** running into any walls or my body.

The apples are at **(5, 6)**, **(4, 3)**, **(7, 3)**, **(2, 5)**, and **(3, 3)**. The enemy snake (ID: 0) has its head at **(6, 2)** with no body.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Apples Locations and Accessibility**:\n\t- The closest apple is **(5, 6)**, which is just **to the right** (towards **x=5**) and **down** (towards **y=6**) from my current position. Since it\u2019s only one move away, this is my **primary target**.\n\t- The other apples are further away and will require more careful planning.\n2. **Boundaries**:\n\t- I\u2019m at **(5, 8)**, so I **cannot move up** anymore since I'm close to the top boundary. Moving **to the left** would take me away from the closest apple, so that\u2019s not ideal.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake is at **(6, 2)**, far enough that it doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat. However, I should avoid moving toward **(6, 2)** just to be safe, since I don\u2019t want to risk head-on collisions in the future.\n4. **Avoiding My Own Body**:\n\t- My body segment is at **(5, 9)**, directly above me. I **cannot move up**, as this would cause me to collide with myself.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- **Primary Goal**: The closest apple **(5, 6)** is just one move **down** and avoids any immediate danger.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: I should not move **right** towards the enemy snake or move **up** (since that\u2019s already blocked by my body). Moving **left** doesn\u2019t move me closer to the apple and is therefore not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **DOWN**, to **(5, 7)**, which will bring me closer to the apple **without** running into any walls or my body. Once I collect the apple at **(5, 6)**, I will plan for the next step accordingly.\n\n### Next Move: **DOWN**.",

(2, 5) - This apple is on the left side, but it\u2019s far away from my current position.\n\nNow, let's think about the goals: I want to maximize my points by collecting apples without running into walls or other snakes. Since I\u2019m at (6, 9), there are a few immediate considerations:\n\n- **Avoiding walls**. I can\u2019t move any further up since I'm already at the top (y = 9).\n- **Avoiding the enemy snake**. It\u2019s not nearby right now, but it's at (6, 2), and I need to be cautious in case it moves up.\n\nStrategically, I think the best immediate move is to **move towards an apple** while avoiding any risk of collision with walls or the other snake.\n\n### Move evaluation:\n\n- **UP** is not an option since I\u2019m already at the top of the board.\n- **DOWN** would take me further away from the closest apples and closer to the enemy snake at (6, 2).\n- **LEFT** takes me closer to the apples (5, 6) and (5, 9), but there's no immediate risk.\n- **RIGHT** moves me away from the closest apples and closer to the edge of the board, which is unnecessary at the moment.\n\n#### **Final strategy**:\n\nMy current goal should be to move toward the closest apple at (5, 6). It\u2019s not directly below me, but I can get closer by going **LEFT**, which will also take me closer to several other apples without any immediate danger.\n\n**NEXT MOVE: LEFT**.",

Since it\u2019s only one move away, this is my **primary target**.\n\t- The other apples are further away and will require more careful planning.\n2. **Boundaries**:\n\t- I\u2019m at **(5, 8)**, so I **cannot move up** anymore since I'm close to the top boundary. Moving **to the left** would take me away from the closest apple, so that\u2019s not ideal.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake is at **(6, 2)**, far enough that it doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat.

Moving **left** doesn\u2019t move me closer to the apple and is therefore not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **DOWN**, to **(5, 7)**, which will bring me closer to the apple **without** running into any walls or my body.

(5, 6) - This apple is a bit below my current position, but it's the closest apple as of now.\n2. (4, 3) - This apple is on the left side but a little further away from my current position.\n3.

(2, 5) - This apple is on the left side, but it\u2019s far away from my current position.\n\nNow, let's think about the goals: I want to maximize my points by collecting apples without running into walls or other snakes.

The apples are at **(5, 6)**, **(4, 3)**, **(7, 3)**, **(2, 5)**, and **(3, 3)**. The enemy snake (ID: 0) has its head at **(6, 2)** with no body.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Apples Locations and Accessibility**:\n\t- The closest apple is **(5, 6)**, which is just **to the right** (towards **x=5**) and **down** (towards **y=6**) from my current position. Since it\u2019s only one move away, this is my **primary target**.\n\t- The other apples are further away and will require more careful planning.\n2. **Boundaries**:\n\t- I\u2019m at **(5, 8)**, so I **cannot move up** anymore since I'm close to the top boundary. Moving **to the left** would take me away from the closest apple, so that\u2019s not ideal.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake is at **(6, 2)**, far enough that it doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat. However, I should avoid moving toward **(6, 2)** just to be safe, since I don\u2019t want to risk head-on collisions in the future.\n4. **Avoiding My Own Body**:\n\t- My body segment is at **(5, 9)**, directly above me. I **cannot move up**, as this would cause me to collide with myself.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- **Primary Goal**: The closest apple **(5, 6)** is just one move **down** and avoids any immediate danger.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: I should not move **right** towards the enemy snake or move **up** (since that\u2019s already blocked by my body). Moving **left** doesn\u2019t move me closer to the apple and is therefore not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **DOWN**, to **(5, 7)**, which will bring me closer to the apple **without** running into any walls or my body. Once I collect the apple at **(5, 6)**, I will plan for the next step accordingly.\n\n### Next Move: **DOWN**.",

The apples are at **(5, 6)**, **(4, 3)**, **(7, 3)**, **(2, 5)**, and **(3, 3)**. The enemy snake (ID: 0) has its head at **(6, 2)** with no body.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Apples Locations and Accessibility**:\n\t- The closest apple is **(5, 6)**, which is just **to the right** (towards **x=5**) and **down** (towards **y=6**) from my current position. Since it\u2019s only one move away, this is my **primary target**.\n\t- The other apples are further away and will require more careful planning.\n2. **Boundaries**:\n\t- I\u2019m at **(5, 8)**, so I **cannot move up** anymore since I'm close to the top boundary. Moving **to the left** would take me away from the closest apple, so that\u2019s not ideal.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake is at **(6, 2)**, far enough that it doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat. However, I should avoid moving toward **(6, 2)** just to be safe, since I don\u2019t want to risk head-on collisions in the future.\n4. **Avoiding My Own Body**:\n\t- My body segment is at **(5, 9)**, directly above me. I **cannot move up**, as this would cause me to collide with myself.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- **Primary Goal**: The closest apple **(5, 6)** is just one move **down** and avoids any immediate danger.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: I should not move **right** towards the enemy snake or move **up** (since that\u2019s already blocked by my body). Moving **left** doesn\u2019t move me closer to the apple and is therefore not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **DOWN**, to **(5, 7)**, which will bring me closer to the apple **without** running into any walls or my body. Once I collect the apple at **(5, 6)**, I will plan for the next step accordingly.\n\n### Next Move: **DOWN**.",

It\u2019s not nearby right now, but it's at (6, 2), and I need to be cautious in case it moves up.\n\nStrategically, I think the best immediate move is to **move towards an apple** while avoiding any risk of collision with walls or the other snake.\n\n### Move evaluation:\n\n- **UP** is not an option since I\u2019m already at the top of the board.\n- **DOWN** would take me further away from the closest apples and closer to the enemy snake at (6, 2).\n- **LEFT** takes me closer to the apples (5, 6) and (5, 9), but there's no immediate risk.\n- **RIGHT** moves me away from the closest apples and closer to the edge of the board, which is unnecessary at the moment.\n\n#### **Final strategy**:\n\nMy current goal should be to move toward the closest apple at (5, 6). It\u2019s not directly below me, but I can get closer by going **LEFT**, which will also take me closer to several other apples without any immediate danger.\n\n**NEXT MOVE: LEFT**.",

I also have an enemy snake (ID 0) with its head at **(6, 2)** and no body.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Apples Locations & Accessibility**:\n\t- The closest apple is **(5, 6)**, which is just one move down from my current position.\n\t- Another apple, **(7, 3)**, is further away and will require me to move to the right and down.\n\t- The apples at **(2, 5)**, **(3, 3)**, and **(4, 3)** are also a few moves away but require me to move left, then down.\n2. **Boundary Considerations**:\n\t- I\u2019m at the top row (y = 9), so I **cannot move up**.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake's head is at **(6, 2)**, which is on the far opposite side of the board.

Since it\u2019s only one move away, this is my **primary target**.\n\t- The other apples are further away and will require more careful planning.\n2. **Boundaries**:\n\t- I\u2019m at **(5, 8)**, so I **cannot move up** anymore since I'm close to the top boundary. Moving **to the left** would take me away from the closest apple, so that\u2019s not ideal.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake is at **(6, 2)**, far enough that it doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat.

Moving **left** doesn\u2019t move me closer to the apple and is therefore not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **DOWN**, to **(5, 7)**, which will bring me closer to the apple **without** running into any walls or my body.

I also have an enemy snake (ID 0) with its head at **(6, 2)** and no body.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Apples Locations & Accessibility**:\n\t- The closest apple is **(5, 6)**, which is just one move down from my current position.\n\t- Another apple, **(7, 3)**, is further away and will require me to move to the right and down.\n\t- The apples at **(2, 5)**, **(3, 3)**, and **(4, 3)** are also a few moves away but require me to move left, then down.\n2. **Boundary Considerations**:\n\t- I\u2019m at the top row (y = 9), so I **cannot move up**.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake's head is at **(6, 2)**, which is on the far opposite side of the board. As of now, it doesn\u2019t seem to pose an immediate threat. I should avoid moving toward its position unless I can be sure it won\u2019t block my path.\n\n### Strategy Analysis:\n\n- My primary goal is to collect apples, starting with the closest one **(5, 6)**.\n- I need to **avoid walls and my own body**.\n- I want to keep an eye on the enemy snake at **(6, 2)**, ensuring I don\u2019t head toward its location unless I\u2019m sure it\u2019s safe.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Moves:\n\n- **UP**: This move is not possible because I\u2019m already at the top of the board (y = 9).\n- **DOWN**: This move would take me toward the apple at **(5, 6)**. This seems like the best immediate move, as it\u2019s directly below me.\n- **LEFT**: I could move left, but that won\u2019t take me closer to the closest apple, and it doesn\u2019t offer any immediate benefit.\n- **RIGHT**: This move would take me away from the closest apple **(5, 6)** and toward the enemy\u2019s general area. It\u2019s not a good move right now.\n\n### Decision:\n\nThe best move right now is to **move down** to collect the closest apple **(5, 6)**. This will allow me to grow and increase my score without risking collision with walls or the enemy snake.\n\n**NEXT MOVE: DOWN.**",

The apples are at **(5, 6)**, **(4, 3)**, **(7, 3)**, **(2, 5)**, and **(3, 3)**. The enemy snake (ID: 0) has its head at **(6, 2)** with no body.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Apples Locations and Accessibility**:\n\t- The closest apple is **(5, 6)**, which is just **to the right** (towards **x=5**) and **down** (towards **y=6**) from my current position. Since it\u2019s only one move away, this is my **primary target**.\n\t- The other apples are further away and will require more careful planning.\n2. **Boundaries**:\n\t- I\u2019m at **(5, 8)**, so I **cannot move up** anymore since I'm close to the top boundary. Moving **to the left** would take me away from the closest apple, so that\u2019s not ideal.\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n\t- The enemy snake is at **(6, 2)**, far enough that it doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat. However, I should avoid moving toward **(6, 2)** just to be safe, since I don\u2019t want to risk head-on collisions in the future.\n4. **Avoiding My Own Body**:\n\t- My body segment is at **(5, 9)**, directly above me. I **cannot move up**, as this would cause me to collide with myself.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- **Primary Goal**: The closest apple **(5, 6)** is just one move **down** and avoids any immediate danger.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: I should not move **right** towards the enemy snake or move **up** (since that\u2019s already blocked by my body). Moving **left** doesn\u2019t move me closer to the apple and is therefore not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe best move is **DOWN**, to **(5, 7)**, which will bring me closer to the apple **without** running into any walls or my body.

There are no obstacles or body segments, only a few apples and an enemy snake (#0) at (6, 2) in the bottom-left corner. Let's break down the apples on the board:\n\n1. (5, 6) - This apple is a bit below my current position, but it's the closest apple as of now.\n2. (4, 3) - This apple is on the left side but a little further away from my current position.\n3. (5, 9) - Another apple near my current position, one row below me.\n4. (7, 3) - Another apple to the right, near the bottom.\n5. (2, 5) - This apple is on the left side, but it\u2019s far away from my current position.\n\nNow, let's think about the goals: I want to maximize my points by collecting apples without running into walls or other snakes. Since I\u2019m at (6, 9), there are a few immediate considerations:\n\n- **Avoiding walls**. I can\u2019t move any further up since I'm already at the top (y = 9).\n- **Avoiding the enemy snake**. It\u2019s not nearby right now, but it's at (6, 2), and I need to be cautious in case it moves up.\n\nStrategically, I think the best immediate move is to **move towards an apple** while avoiding any risk of collision with walls or the other snake.\n\n### Move evaluation:\n\n- **UP** is not an option since I\u2019m already at the top of the board.\n- **DOWN** would take me further away from the closest apples and closer to the enemy snake at (6, 2).\n- **LEFT** takes me closer to the apples (5, 6) and (5, 9), but there's no immediate risk.\n- **RIGHT** moves me away from the closest apples and closer to the edge of the board, which is unnecessary at the moment.\n\n#### **Final strategy**:\n\nMy current goal should be to move toward the closest apple at (5, 6).

There are no obstacles or body segments, only a few apples and an enemy snake (#0) at (6, 2) in the bottom-left corner. Let's break down the apples on the board:\n\n1. (5, 6) - This apple is a bit below my current position, but it's the closest apple as of now.\n2. (4, 3) - This apple is on the left side but a little further away from my current position.\n3.

(5, 6) - This apple is a bit below my current position, but it's the closest apple as of now.\n2. (4, 3) - This apple is on the left side but a little further away from my current position.\n3.
