However, moving left would put me at (8, 8), which is not an apple. The next closest apple is at (3, 9), which is quite far.\n\nGiven the current position, I should move towards the apple at (7, 8) by moving left. However, since (7, 8) is not directly reachable in one move, I need to find a path.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up to (9, 9) is not possible as it's out of bounds. Moving right to (9, 9) is also out of bounds. Moving down to (9, 7) is possible, but it's not towards any apple.\n\nGiven the options, moving left to (8, 8) seems the most reasonable, even though it's not directly towards an apple. It's a safe move that keeps me away from the enemy snake and the walls.\n\n**RIGHT** [/OUT]",
