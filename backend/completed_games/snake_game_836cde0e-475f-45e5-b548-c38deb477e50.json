Good!\n\n**Move Safety Check:**\n\nCurrent position: (8, 4)\nBody occupies: (7, 4)\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (8, 5): Safe, within bounds, not on body. \u2713\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 3): Safe, within bounds, not on body. \u2713\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (7, 4): This is my body! UNSAFE. \u2717\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 4): Safe, within bounds, not on body. \u2713\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\nNext apple locations relative to (8, 4):\n- (9, 5): 1 right + 1 up = 2 moves away (closest)\n- (5, 7): 3 left + 3 up = 6 moves away\n- (1, 4): 7 left = 7 moves away\n- (2, 9): 6 left + 5 up = 11 moves away\n- (0, 0): 8 left + 4 down = 12 moves away\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (9, 8). It's moving independently and currently far from me.\n\n**Optimal Path Analysis:**\n- To reach (9, 5): I need to go RIGHT then UP (or UP then RIGHT)\n- Moving UP to (8, 5) puts me one move away from (9, 5)\n- This continues the greedy approach of collecting nearby apples\n- After UP, I can move RIGHT to (9, 5) next turn to collect another apple\n\n**Why UP is optimal:**\n- Moves me directly closer to the nearest unclaimed apple at (9, 5)\n- Keeps my options open (can move RIGHT or UP or DOWN next turn)\n- Avoids potential congestion on the board\n- Safe from enemy snake #0 which is at (9, 8)\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. Move UP to (8, 5) this turn\n2. Move RIGHT to (9, 5) next turn to collect apple #2\n3. Then reassess based on remaining apples and enemy position\n4. Continue collecting nearby apples while avoiding the enemy and board edges\n\nUP",
