None of these adjacent cells have an apple, but (5,5) gets me closer to (6,5), while moving to (5,3) or (4,4) would take me farther from the closest apple. Enemy snake is at (5,1), which is below, not an immediate threat, but I should avoid areas with potential danger. Staying in the middle of the board gives me more movement options. For the first move, I'll choose to move up to (5,5) since it's the best path toward the nearest food without risking anything. In the next turn, I'll move right to (6,5) if it's still free and then eat the apple. But I must ensure I don't move into any obstacles.\n\n**Decided next move:** I am choosing to move up to (5,5).

The apples available are at (7,9), (1,1), (3,1), (2,0), and (5,0). The closest apple is at (3,1), with a Manhattan distance of |3-3| + |5-1| = 4. Moving DOWN (decreasing y) is the most efficient way to reduce this distance, as it keeps the x-coordinate the same and decreases y towards the apple. Other directions like LEFT, RIGHT, or UP either keep the distance high or increase it, potentially wasting moves.\n\nThe board is mostly empty, with no obvious threats from walls, apples, or enemy snakes in this vicinity. The enemy snake is at (8,1) with no body, so it's just a threat at y=1, but it's not close enough to interfere with my path. After eating the apple at (3,1), my body will grow, and I'll need to then target the next closest apple, such as (2,0) or (1,1), using a similar step-by-step approach. I should avoid wandering into areas with high enemy risk or multiple obstacles, but for now, the direct path is clear and safe.\n\n**Decided next move: DOWN**\n\n### Strategy for next turn:\nAfter moving DOWN multiple times to reach (3,1) and eat the apple, I will have a body size of 2. Then, I'll reassess the board to find the next closest apple, prioritizing (2,0) or (1,1) due to their positions relative to my new location. I'll continue moving step by-step, avoiding the enemy snake if possible by not going directly towards it. Since the game allows multiple apples, eating the small ones first helps build a point lead incrementally, but I need to watch for any changes in board state, such as enemy movements or new obstacles. I'll maintain a steady direction to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary u-turns.\n\n### End of response.",
