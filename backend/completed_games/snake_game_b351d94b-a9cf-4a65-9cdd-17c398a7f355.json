This move should also help me avoid the enemy snake, which is currently at (2, 5).\n\nStrategy for the next turn: I'll continue to prioritize moving towards the apples while trying to avoid running into the enemy snake.

The cell at (5, 9) appears empty, and there's no immediate threat of collision, especially as the opponent snake is at (8,5).\n\n- Continuing upward toward (5, 9) would be a strategy to reach the apple at (8, 9) in subsequent moves.\n\n- Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (6, 8) seems safe and could help progress toward the apple at (8, 9), but perhaps less directly.\n\nGiven that, moving UP toward (5, 9) seems promising because it aligns with moving closer vertically toward our target apple at (8, 9). \n\nNext move: UP",
