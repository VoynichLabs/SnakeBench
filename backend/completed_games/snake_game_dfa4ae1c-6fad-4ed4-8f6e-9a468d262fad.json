Next segment would be (2,5), etc.\n  - Enemy head is at (1,6), so moving right to (1,5) is safe.\n  - This keeps the snake horizontally oriented, which is safer in the long run.\n  - Apples nearby: (5,5) is reachable in a few moves, but we'd need to turn around.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\n- Avoid vertical orientation as much as possible, as it makes it easier for enemies to attack from the sides.\n- Prioritize horizontal orientation to keep the snake's length and direction more predictable.\n- Move toward the nearest apple (5,5) while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**RIGHT** is the safer and more strategic move.

Moving to (2,5) is safe, but moving to (3,5) or (2,6) could be risky if the enemy moves toward you.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves:\n1. **UP**: (2,5) \u2192 (1,5). No immediate danger, but this is a vertical move. The enemy is at (3,6), so moving up could expose your snake to potential attacks from the sides (left/right) in future turns. Also, this move doesn't progress toward any apple.\n2. **DOWN**: (2,5) \u2192 (2,6). The enemy is at (3,6), so moving to (2,6) is safe. This keeps your snake horizontally aligned, which is safer in the long run. It's a step toward the apple at (5,5).\n3. **LEFT**: (2,5) \u2192 (1,5). This is a safe move, but it doesn't directly progress toward any apple. It's a defensive move to avoid potential future collisions.\n4. **RIGHT**: (2,5) \u2192 (3,5). This is a safe move and keeps the snake horizontally aligned. It's a step toward the apple at (5,5), but the enemy is at (3,6), so moving to (3,5) could be risky if the enemy moves toward you.\n\n### Closer to Apples:\n- The nearest apple is (5,5). Moving down to (2,6) is a step toward this apple, while moving right to (3,5) is also a step toward it but risks the enemy.\n\n### Enemy Monitoring:\n- The enemy is stationary at (3,6). Moving down to (2,6) keeps the snake away from the enemy's potential attack line. Moving right to (3,5) is risky because the enemy could move toward you.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Objective**: Reach the apple at (5,5) while avoiding enemy threats.\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - Move down to (2,6) to avoid immediate danger and keep the snake horizontally aligned.\n  - Continue moving down-right to (3,6) and (4,6) to reach (5,5) safely.\n  - Monitor the enemy\u2019s position and avoid moving into its path.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest move is **DOWN** to (2,6). This move keeps the snake horizontally aligned, avoids immediate danger, and keeps the path open toward the apple at (5,5).\n\nDOWN",

This maintains good positioning while keeping options open.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\nNext turn, if the apple at (5,5) is still there and no enemy is blocking, move DOWN to collect it.

It\u2019s stationary, but its head is to the right of yours, so moving **UP (2,4)** or **LEFT (1,5)** reduces exposure.\n3. **Apples**: Closest is **(7,1)** (Manhattan distance = 3 steps: right 5, up 2).

My snake is now length 2 (head at (6,5), body at (5,5))\n2. The enemy is at (2,5) - left from me on the same row\n3. The closest apple is at (7,4) - 1 unit right and 1 unit down\n4. Moving RIGHT would put me at (7,5) - same x as the (7,4) apple but 1 unit above it\n5. Moving DOWN would put me at (6,4) - 1 unit left and 1 unit down from the (7,4) apple\n6. Moving UP would put me at (6,6) - away from all apples\n7. Moving LEFT would put me at (5,5) - my own body (suicide)\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- UP: (6,6) - safe, empty space\n- DOWN: (6,4) - safe, empty space\n- LEFT: (5,5) - my own body (DEADLY)\n- RIGHT: (7,5) - safe, empty space\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. The apple at (7,4) is still the closest reachable apple\n2. Moving RIGHT gets me to x=7, same as the apple, then I can move DOWN next turn to reach it\n3. Moving DOWN gets me closer vertically but not horizontally\n4. Moving UP takes me away from all apples\n5. The enemy is not immediately threatening but is on the same row to my left\n\n**Best Option:**\n- RIGHT: Moves me to (7,5), positioning me perfectly to reach the (7,4) apple next turn by moving DOWN\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\nAfter moving right to (7,5), I'll move DOWN to (7,4) to collect the apple. I'll need to monitor the enemy's movements to ensure they don't block my path or create a collision risk.\n\nRIGHT",
