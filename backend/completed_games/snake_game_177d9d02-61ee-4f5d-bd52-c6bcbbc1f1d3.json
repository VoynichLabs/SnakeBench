I can plan a route upward and to the left to reach it without taking significant risks. It requires coordinated movement to avoid cornering myself while navigating past my existing body segment.  \n   - **Apple at `(9, 0)`**: This apple is quite close but requires moving downward and slightly to the right. Choosing this apple may lead to a riskier position near the board's bottom-left corner, particularly as the apple at `(6, 6)` is likely a safer strategic choice.  \n   - **Apples at `(2, 8)` and `(0, 5)`**: These apples remain far away and likely targets for Snake #0. I can deprioritize them for now.  \n\n3. **Relative Risks and Evaluation**:  \n   - The top-left portion of the board (`(6,6)`) offers the safest pathway for traversal. Apple `(6,6)` allows me to reach a favorable position for later moves, while apples in corners like `(9,0)` or distant `(0,5)` may trap me.  \n   - Moving directly upward to `(8, 2)` is safe for now and prepares me for the longer route to `(6, 6)`. This path avoids unnecessary turns and conserves flexibility.  \n   - My body segment is directly below me, blocking a downward move\u2014and moving left or right currently isn\u2019t helpful.  \n\n---\n\n### **Plan for Current Move and Strategy Notes**  \n- **Next Move**:  \n   - Move **UP** to `(8, 2)`, starting the journey toward `(6, 6)`.  \n   - This move is the safest and most efficient, positioning me closer to the remaining apples while ensuring no immediate risks.  \n- **Next Turn Strategy**:  \n   - Evaluate if continuing upward or turning left toward `(6, 6)` is optimal, depending on board dynamics and the position of Snake #0.\n   - Monitor Snake #0\u2019s movement toward apples like `(2, 8)` or `(0, 5)`. Prioritize avoiding risky paths in case it becomes more aggressive.  \n\n---\n\n**Decided Next Move**: UP"

My last move was UP, and I\u2019ve made progress toward `(6, 6)`.\n\n2. **Apples Analysis:**\n   - **(2, 8):** Far to the top-left. It would take several turns to reach this\u2014with Snake #0 in that region, it is risky for now.  \n   - **(0, 5):** Deep in the bottom-left area of the board. It\u2019s far and unlikely that I\u2019ll pursue it soon.  \n   - **(9, 0):** Positioned in the far bottom-right corner. It\u2019s not ideal to head to this apple right now because it would lead me to a very cornered area.  \n   - **(6, 6):** This apple is **still the closest and most direct target**. I need to keep moving toward it safely.  \n   - **(7, 7):** While this apple is also relatively close, moving toward `(6, 6)` first aligns me better to reach both apples in sequence if needed.\n\n3. **Enemies:**\n   - **Snake #0 is at `(3, 7)` with no body.**  \n     - It remains far enough away to avoid any interference in my immediate plans for `(6, 6)`.  \n     - However, I will need to monitor it in case it adjusts toward any apple that\u2019s also in my path.  \n   - No other obstacles are present for now beyond walls and my own snake\u2019s body.\n\n4. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - I\u2019m heading toward `(6, 6)`, which aligns with my overall strategy for safety and efficiency.  \n   - Reducing y-coordinate too soon (heading LEFT or DOWN prematurely) could open unnecessary risk. I need to maneuver safely while prioritizing **open paths** toward `(6, 6)`.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation of Current Possible Moves**\nFrom my current position `(8, 4)`, my options are as follows:\n\n#### 1. **UP (to `(8, 5)`):**\n   - Keeps me safely aligned with `(6, 6)`.  \n   - Positions me to turn LEFT toward `(7, 6)` or continue moving UP depending on conditions.  \n   - This is likely the safest, most logical move *for now*.\n\n#### 2. **LEFT (to `(7, 4)`):**\n   - Begins the shift toward `(6, 6)`, but reduces my y-coordinate prematurely.  \n   - This might limit flexibility in future moves by putting me closer to being cornered between lower y-levels and my body.  \n   - Not ideal unless absolutely necessary.\n\n#### 3. **DOWN (to `(8, 3)`):**\n   - **Impossible!** I would collide with my body and die.\n\n#### 4. **RIGHT (to `(9, 4)`):**\n   - Moves me farther away from `(6, 6)`. Inefficient and positions me closer to the **corner**, which could result in dangerous constriction.\n\n---\n\n### **Planned Action and Next Move Rationale**\n**Choosing UP to `(8, 5)`**:\n1. Keeps me aligned both vertically and horizontally with the closest apple at `(6, 6)`.  \n2. Avoids unnecessary risks or inefficient moves that might limit flexibility.  \n3. Ensures I\u2019m maintaining proximity to potential secondary apples, such as `(7, 7)`.\n\n### **Next Turn Strategy:**\n- After moving UP to `(8, 5)`, prioritize re-assessing:\n  - Continue LEFT to approach `(7, 6)`.  \n  - Monitor Snake #0\u2019s path and adjust accordingly if it begins heading toward my plan\u2019s trajectory.  \n  - Avoid moving into areas where I might be constrained unnecessarily by walls or my own body.\n\n---\n\n**Decision for Current Turn:** **UP**"

Prioritizing this would be inefficient, given the closer apples at `(6, 6)` and `(7, 7)`.  \n   - **(0, 5):** Far to the left-middle of the board. Moving toward this apple would lead me in the opposite direction of `(6, 6)` and into potentially constrained positions.  \n   - **(9, 0):** Located in the far bottom-right corner. This apple is even less of a priority, as it would take many moves to get there and increase the risk of being cornered.  \n   - **(6, 6):** The closest apple and still my primary target. Moving toward this apple aligns with an efficient route and maintains flexibility for future moves.  \n   - **(7, 7):** Another reasonably close apple that aligns well as a secondary target after `(6, 6)`.\n\n---\n\n3. **Enemy Snake:**\n   - **Snake #0:** At `(3, 8)` with no body and positioned far from me. It does not pose an immediate threat, but I should monitor any moves it makes, especially toward shared apple targets.   \n   - Currently, there is **no immediate danger** of head-to-head collisions with the enemy snake.\n\n---\n\n4. **Evaluation of Current Possible Moves:**\n\nFrom my current position `(8, 5)`, the possible moves are:\n\n#### a) **UP (to `(8, 6)`):**\n   - Keeps me aligned horizontally with `(6, 6)` while letting me move closer vertically.  \n   - My snake will remain centrally positioned, maintaining good flexibility for follow-up moves.\n   - SAFETY: No immediate danger. \n\n#### b) **LEFT (to `(7, 5)`):**\n   - Starts to progress toward `(6, 6)` directly.\n   - Keeps my body out of immediate danger and builds a path for the next steps.  \n   - SAFETY: No immediate danger, but decreases y-coordinate slightly. Strategically fine.\n\n#### c) **DOWN (to `(8, 4)`):**\n   - **Impossible!** I would collide with my own body and die.\n\n#### d) **RIGHT (to `(9, 5)`):**\n   - Moves away from target apple `(6, 6)` and positions me closer to the wall.  \n   - Risky due to reduced flexibility and inefficient in terms of pathing.  \n   - SAFETY: No immediate danger, but strategically poor.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Next Move:**\n\n#### **UP (to `(8, 6)`)**\n1. Moving UP will push me closer to `(6, 6)` while maintaining my central positioning and flexibility.  \n2. From `(8, 6)`, I\u2019ll have options to move LEFT toward `(7, 6)` or continue UP toward `(7, 7)` if needed.  \n3. It sets me up optimally to collect both `(6, 6)` and `(7, 7)` apples in sequence.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Turn Strategy:**\n- After reaching `(8, 6)`, prioritize moving **LEFT** toward `(7, 6)` to approach `(6, 6)`.  \n- Monitor the movements of Snake #0.  \n- Avoid risky moves near the board edges or that place me in overly constrained positions.\n\n---\n\n**Decision for Current Turn:** **UP**"
