Enemy snake #1 is at (0, 3) with body extending to (2, 4).\n\n## Safety Analysis\n- **UP (1, 8) \u2192 (1, 9)**: Safe - no obstacles\n- **DOWN (1, 8) \u2192 (1, 7)**: Safe - no obstacles\n- **LEFT (1, 8) \u2192 (0, 8)**: Safe - no obstacles\n- **RIGHT (1, 8) \u2192 (2, 8)**: Safe - this is my former head position (tail)\n\n## Strategic Considerations\n1. **Apple positions**: (5, 9) is northeast, (1, 6) is directly south, (9, 0) is southeast, (6, 1) is southeast, (8, 2) is southeast\n2. **Enemy positioning**: Enemy #1 is at (0, 3) with body extending to (2, 4) - they're to my west and south\n3. **Body positioning**: My body extends from (1, 8) to (7, 6), moving south and east\n\n## Move Evaluation\n- **UP to (1, 9)**: Moves north, no immediate apple, but stays on the left side of the board\n- **DOWN to (1, 7)**: Moves south, no immediate apple, but positions me closer to (1, 6)\n- **LEFT to (0, 8)**: Moves west, no immediate apple, but keeps me on the left side\n- **RIGHT to (2, 8)**: Moves east, no immediate apple, but opens up paths toward (5, 9) and (6, 1)\n\n## Risk Assessment\nAll moves are safe. DOWN positions me closest to the nearest apple (1, 6). RIGHT opens up the most options for future moves toward multiple apples. UP and LEFT keep me on the safer left side of the board away from the enemy.\n\n## Long-term Strategy\nI should aim to collect (1, 6) as it's closest, then work my way toward the cluster of apples in the southeast (6, 1), (8, 2), (9, 0).
