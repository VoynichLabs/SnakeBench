          "rationale": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n**Current state:**\n- My snake (ID 1) is at (8,5), length 1, no body segments.\n- Snake #0 is at (9,0), length 1, no body segments.\n- Apples: (1,4), (8,0), (4,8), (5,8), (6,4).\n\n**1. Check each direction for immediate death:**\n\n- **UP** from (8,5) \u2192 (8,6): Empty cell, no enemy body, no self body. Safe.  \n- **DOWN** from (8,5) \u2192 (8,4): Empty cell, no enemy body, no self body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** from (8,5) \u2192 (7,5): Empty cell, no enemy body, no self body. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** from (8,5) \u2192 (9,5): Empty cell, no enemy body, no self body. Safe.\n\nSo all four moves are immediately safe.\n\n---\n\n**2. Check enemy snake's possible moves:**  \nEnemy snake #0 is at (9,0): possible moves: UP to (9,1), LEFT to (8,0), UP might be towards apple (8,0)? Actually apple (8,0) is left from him (8,0); his possible moves: Up (9,1), Left (8,0, where there's an apple), Down and Right are blocked (Right off-board, down off-board; wait check: y=0, so DOWN would be off board invalid).  \n\nActually y=0: so only valid moves for enemy: UP (9,1) and LEFT (8,0) (apple there). He'll probably go LEFT to eat apple (8,0), growing to length 2.\n\nSo enemy likely stays near bottom row after this turn.\n\n---\n\n**3. Risk of head-on collision this turn?**  \nMe going LEFT to (7,5) or RIGHT to (9,5): Could enemy reach those? No, enemy at (9,0) can't reach my coordinates in one move except if I go RIGHT to (9,5) \u2014 is that possible? Enemy could go UP five times? No, one move only: impossible. So no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\nSo all four moves avoid immediate head-on collision.\n\n---\n\n**4. Which moves move me toward apples with safe access?**  \nClosest apples are at (6,4) and (8,0).  \n\n- Going DOWN (8,4) puts me closer to (6,4) horizontally: from (8,4) to (6,4) is 2 steps horiz, 0 vertical. Good step.  \n- Going LEFT (7,5) is also toward (6,4) but from above.  \n- Going RIGHT pointless (away from apples except maybe long-term but board empty there).  \n- Going UP to (8,6) takes me further from nearest apples.\n\nAlso apple (8,0) is closer vertically from (8,5) but enemy heading there now; competing for it might be risky soon but not immediate.\n\n---\n\n**5. Future mobility:**  \nFrom (8,4): possible next moves (depending on turn 1 results) likely safe unless snake #0 grows and moves up gradually.  \nFrom (7,5): similarly safe, opens central board access.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT seem fine for future options.\n\n---\n\n**6. Consider avoiding future dead ends:**  \nCentral board has more space. Moving DOWN enters more open area (row 4) with apple proximity. LEFT then DOWN next turn also possible.\n\nActually immediate chase for (6,4): If I go LEFT to (7,5) then next turn I'd need LEFT+DOWN or DOWN+LEFT to reach it in 2 turns.  \nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn LEFT to (7,4) then LEFT again to (6,4) in 2 turns as well.  \n\nSimilarly direct but DOWN feels slightly more central.\n\n---\n\n**7. Very slight preference:**  \nBeing at y=4 after this move gives flexibility; also avoids top-right corner which might be less traversable later. I'll choose DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** Try to go for apple (6,4) while watching snake #0's growth from apple (8,0). Keep space to retreat if snake #0 moves up.\n\nDOWN",

Next turn I\u2019ll need to avoid moving RIGHT into (6,4).\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (5,4), consider moves: UP to (5,5), DOWN to (5,3), LEFT to (4,4) toward apple at (3,4).

All except DOWN are safe for enemy.  \nAt current positions, enemy is 4 cells away in Manhattan distance, no immediate collision threat for this turn.\n\n**4.

Apple targeting:**  \nApples at (0, 6), (1, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9) are all far (top half).  \nShortest path to nearest apple (0, 6): go LEFT then UP.

Wait \u2014 body: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4).  \nIf I move UP to (2,3), body becomes [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)] with head at (2,3). Next turn LEFT is (1,3) = body segment dead. So UP and then LEFT not possible next turn. Similarly, going RIGHT or DOWN avoids body constraints.\n\nBetter plan: move DOWN or RIGHT to gain more space, then maneuver toward apples later when body has shifted.\n\n**6.

RIGHT heads east toward center and closer to apples (4,8) later.  \nRIGHT seems better because it opens path to upper-right apples and keeps central board access.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move RIGHT this turn.

Enemy possible moves from (4, 8):**  \nEnemy\u2019s possible moves: UP (4, 9) \u2192 empty, DOWN (4, 7) \u2192 its body (deadly), LEFT (3, 8) \u2192 empty, RIGHT (5, 8) \u2192 apple.  \nEnemy Manhattan distance 5 \u2192 no direct collision threat this turn.\n\n**4. Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- UP (3, 4): Next turn from (3, 4): UP (3, 5) safe, DOWN (3, 3) safe, LEFT (2, 4) safe, RIGHT (4, 4) safe \u2192 4 safe moves.  \n- LEFT (2, 3): Next turn from (2, 3): UP (2, 4) safe, DOWN (2, 2) safe (body will move away), LEFT (1, 3) safe, RIGHT (3, 3) safe \u2192 4 safe moves.  \n- RIGHT (4, 3): Next turn from (4, 3): UP (4, 4) safe, DOWN (4, 2) safe, LEFT (3, 3) safe, RIGHT (5, 3) safe \u2192 4 safe moves.  \n\nAll moves have full mobility next turn.\n\n**5. Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (5, 8), (1, 8), (5, 9), (0, 6), (3, 6).  \nNearest apple: (3, 6) is 3 steps away (Manhattan distance).  \nUP gets me closer to (3, 6) \u2014 UP, then possibly RIGHT next turn.  \nLEFT is away from most apples except (1, 8).  \nRIGHT is toward (5, 8), (5, 9).  \nEnemy at (4, 8) might go to (5, 8) for apple, competing for top apples \u2014 risky.\n\n(0, 6) is also near the current path but requires going left after UP.\n\n**6. Strategic choice:**  \nUP directly approaches (3, 6) and is safe.  \nAvoid RIGHT because enemy might compete near (5, 8) and could cut me off.  \nLEFT is safe but moves away from immediate apple opportunities.  \nBest choice: UP to (3, 4), then next turn go UP to (3, 5) and then RIGHT to (4, 5) or UP to (3, 6) if still there.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move UP this turn. Next turn from (3, 4), assess apple (3, 6) \u2014 if still available, move UP again to grab it. If enemy moves toward (5, 8), avoid competing directly until longer. Monitor enemy path.\n\nUP",

Wait, board shows (2,4) empty; actually map legend says A at (2,4) but grid shows it as \".\" \u2014 looks like apple there but board drawing says \".\" \u2192 contradiction?

So LEFT (2,4) has apple = safe (eating apple = safe growth).  \n- RIGHT (4, 4): empty \u2192 safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT (to apple), RIGHT.\n\n**3. Enemy possible moves from (5, 8):**  \nEnemy possible moves: UP (5,9) apple, DOWN (5,7) empty, LEFT (4,8) its body (deadly), RIGHT (6,8) empty.  \nSo enemy's safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.

Possible enemy moves and collision risk:**  \nEnemy at (1, 9) could move DOWN to (1, 8) or LEFT to (0, 9).  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (1, 8), that\u2019s an apple location \u2014 they might take it.  \nNo immediate adjacency risk; enemy is 2 cells away horizontally and vertically.\n\n**5.

That would cause a head-on collision and both die.  \nEnemy could also move DOWN to (1, 7) \u2014 same cell I might move LEFT into.  \nSo both UP and LEFT risk head-on collision if enemy chooses that direction.\n\n**5. Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple: (0, 6) is 3 steps away.  \n(5, 7) is 3 steps away.  \n(2, 1) is 6 steps away.  \n(1, 8) apple is gone \u2014 enemy ate it last turn (their length increased from 5 to 6 segments).  \n\n**6.

Wait \u2014 enemy will move this turn, so next turn (1, 8) might be empty or enemy body. If enemy moves DOWN or LEFT, (1, 8) becomes enemy body \u2192 deadly. RIGHT (3, 8) empty. So likely only 1 safe move next turn.  \n- DOWN (2, 6): next turn safe moves: UP (2, 7) body deadly, DOWN (2, 5) body deadly, LEFT (1, 6), RIGHT (3, 6) body deadly \u2192 only 1 safe move.  \n- LEFT (1, 7): next turn safe moves: UP (1, 8) enemy body deadly? If enemy moves DOWN to (1, 7), head-on collision this turn \u2014 so if I survive, enemy not there. But if enemy moves LEFT or RIGHT, (1, 8) is enemy body \u2192 deadly. DOWN (1, 6), LEFT (0, 7), RIGHT (2, 7) body deadly \u2192 likely 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**7. Risk assessment:**  \nUP: high risk of head-on collision if enemy goes RIGHT.  \nLEFT: high risk of head-on collision if enemy goes DOWN.  \nDOWN: no collision risk with enemy head (enemy can't reach (2,6) in one move from (1,8)).  \n\n**8. Strategy:**  \nAvoid head-on collision \u2014 enemy has equal length, so collision is bad.  \nDOWN is safest regarding enemy interaction.  \nDOWN also moves toward apple (2, 1) in the long run, but more immediately keeps options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** After DOWN to (2,6), next turn I can go LEFT to (1,6) or RIGHT to (3,6) if safe. Try to maneuver toward (0,6) apple while avoiding enemy. Monitor enemy movement \u2014 they may go for (9,4) or (5,7).  \n\nDOWN",

Collision risk:**  \nEnemy can go DOWN to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 7).  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 6) and enemy goes DOWN to (0, 6), we have a head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \nIf I go UP to (1, 7) and enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 7), head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \nIf I go DOWN to (1, 5), enemy cannot reach me in one move \u2192 safe.\n\n**5. Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple: (0, 6) is 1 step away (LEFT).  \nBut going LEFT risks head-on collision if enemy goes DOWN.  \nNext closest: (5, 7) is 6 steps away; (2, 1) is 5 steps away.\n\n**6. Mobility after each safe move:**  \n- LEFT (0, 6): If I survive (enemy doesn\u2019t go DOWN), I eat apple and grow. Next turn from (0, 6): UP (0, 7) enemy head? Wait, enemy will move this turn too \u2014 need to check after their move. But risky due to collision chance now.  \n- UP (1, 7): Risk head-on collision with enemy RIGHT.  \n- DOWN (1, 5): Safe from collision. From (1, 5): possible moves UP (back to 1,6) body deadly? Yes, body at (2,5) not adjacent? Actually (1,5) neighbors: UP (1,6) body deadly? (1,6) is my old head position \u2014 no, body is [(2,6), ...] \u2014 but (1,6) is now empty? Wait, after I move, my body shifts: head moves to new spot, tail moves away from old tail. Let\u2019s check: if I go DOWN to (1,5), next turn my body will be: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5) \u2014 so (1,6) will be my neck, so UP next turn is into my own body \u2192 deadly. So from (1,5) next turn: UP deadly, DOWN (1,4) empty safe, LEFT (0,5) empty safe, RIGHT (2,5) my body deadly. So 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 okay mobility.  \n\n**7. Strategy:**  \nAvoid head-on collision: both LEFT and UP risky. DOWN is safe from collision and gives 2 safe moves next turn.  \nLEFT to (0,6) is tempting for apple but if enemy goes DOWN we both die \u2014 not worth it since scores are tied and dying loses.  \nEnemy might avoid (0,6) if they think I\u2019ll go there, but they might risk it for apple. I should play safe.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo DOWN this turn to (1,5) to avoid collision. Next turn from (1,5) go to (0,5) or (1,4) to maneuver toward apple (2,1) or (5,7). Keep enemy in view \u2014 they\u2019ll be at either (0,6) or (1,7) after this turn.  \n\nDOWN",

Collision risk analysis:**  \n- If I go LEFT (1, 2) and enemy goes DOWN (1, 2): head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \n- If I go DOWN (2, 1) or RIGHT (3, 2): enemy cannot reach me in one move (enemy only goes DOWN).  \nLEFT is risky due to potential head-on collision with enemy going DOWN.\n\n**5. Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (2, 1), 1 step away (DOWN).  \n- DOWN (2, 1) eats apple immediately.  \n- RIGHT (3, 2) moves away from closest apple.  \n- LEFT (1, 2) risks collision and delays apple.\n\n**6. Mobility analysis:**  \n- DOWN (2, 1): Next turn from (2, 1): UP (2, 2) body deadly, DOWN (2, 0) safe, LEFT (1, 1) safe, RIGHT (3, 1) safe \u2192 3 safe moves.

Strategy:**  \nAvoid LEFT due to head-on collision risk with enemy's only safe move (DOWN).  \nDOWN eats apple (2, 1) immediately, grows to length 8 (same as enemy), and gives good mobility.  \nRIGHT is safe but misses closest apple.  \nSince enemy is forced to go DOWN to (1, 2), I should avoid (1, 2) entirely.  \nEating apple now ties length with enemy and improves position.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (2, 1), next turn from (2, 1) will have safe moves DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Consider moving toward center board or other apples like (5, 7) or (7, 0) while avoiding enemy. Monitor enemy movement\u2014it will be at (1, 2) next turn.\n\nDOWN",

Strategy:**  \nRIGHT gives the best mobility and moves toward center/right-side apples like (5, 7) in the future.  \nIf I go UP, enemy could move to (1, 0) or (0, 1), but I'm safe either way.  \nAvoid DOWN since it reduces options next turn (edge of board).  \nGo RIGHT to stay flexible.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (4, 1), next turn I'll have UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe. Consider gradually moving toward (5, 7) or (9, 4)/(9, 5) while monitoring enemy's position \u2014 enemy is trapped at bottom-left corner but could try to threaten me later.

Likely enemy dies this turn.\n\n**4. Collision risk analysis:**  \nIf enemy somehow survives (e.g., if rules allow moving into own body only if it's directly behind head? Wait, rule says: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body counts as hitting yourself and you die\" \u2014 but here, enemy's DOWN is (0,1) which is body but not directly behind head? Actually, directly behind head is (0,1) if last move was UP? Let's check: enemy's last move was UP from (0,1) to (0,2), so tail is at (0,3). The cell behind head (0,2) is (0,1) which is body but not the tail \u2014 so it's deadly anyway. So enemy has no safe moves. So enemy will die this turn.  \nThus, no collision risk from enemy.\n\n**5. Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (5, 7): distance 4 steps (manhattan).  \n- (2, 9): distance 6 steps.  \n- (7, 0): distance 7 steps.  \n- (9, 4) and (9, 5): far.  \nUP moves toward (5, 7).  \nLEFT moves toward (2, 9).  \nRIGHT moves toward (9,4)/(9,5) but longer path.\n\n**6. Mobility analysis:**  \n- UP (5, 4): Next turn from (5, 4): UP (5, 5) safe, DOWN (5, 3) body deadly, LEFT (4, 4) safe, RIGHT (6, 4) safe \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \n- LEFT (4, 3): Next turn from (4, 3): UP (4, 4) safe, DOWN (4, 2) safe, LEFT (3, 3) safe, RIGHT (5, 3) body deadly \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \n- RIGHT (6, 3): Next turn from (6, 3): UP (6, 4) safe, DOWN (6, 2) safe, LEFT (5, 3) body deadly, RIGHT (7, 3) safe \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \nAll three safe moves offer 3 safe moves next turn \u2014 equal mobility.\n\n**7. Strategy:**  \nEnemy will likely die this turn, leaving me alone. Then I just need to collect apples safely.  \nUP goes toward (5, 7) efficiently.  \nLEFT goes toward (2, 9) but also near where enemy was \u2014 but enemy dead soon.  \nRIGHT goes to right-side apples but they are farther.  \nBest to go UP toward closest apple (5, 7) and center control.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nEnemy should be dead.

Let's check enemy's current safe moves from (0, 3):  \n- UP (0, 4): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (0, 2): enemy body \u2192 deadly. **Not safe.**  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 deadly. **Not safe.**  \n- RIGHT (1, 3): enemy body \u2192 deadly. **Not safe.**  \nSo enemy's only safe move is UP (0, 4). So enemy will likely go UP this turn.\n\n**4. Collision risk analysis:**  \nEnemy's only move is UP to (0, 4). My possible moves:  \n- UP (5, 5): far from enemy \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (4, 4): far from enemy \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (6, 4): far from enemy \u2192 safe.  \nNo head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**5. Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (5, 7): distance 3 steps (manhattan).  \n- (2, 9): distance 7 steps.  \n- (9, 4): distance 5 steps.  \n- (9, 5): distance 5 steps.  \n- (7, 0): far.  \nUP moves toward (5, 7) efficiently.  \nLEFT moves toward (2, 9) but longer path.  \nRIGHT moves toward (9,4)/(9,5) \u2014 also good but slightly farther than (5,7).\n\n**6. Mobility analysis:**  \n- UP (5, 5): Next turn from (5, 5): UP (5, 6) safe, DOWN (5, 4) body deadly, LEFT (4, 5) safe, RIGHT (6, 5) safe \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \n- LEFT (4, 4): Next turn from (4, 4): UP (4, 5) safe, DOWN (4, 3) safe, LEFT (3, 4) safe, RIGHT (5, 4) body deadly \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \n- RIGHT (6, 4): Next turn from (6, 4): UP (6, 5) safe, DOWN (6, 3) safe, LEFT (5, 4) body deadly, RIGHT (7, 4) safe \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \nAll three safe moves offer 3 safe moves next turn \u2014 equal mobility.\n\n**7. Strategy:**  \nEnemy is constrained to move UP along left wall \u2014 not an immediate threat.  \nBest to go UP toward closest apple (5, 7) efficiently.  \nAfter eating (5, 7), I can plan route to (2, 9) or right-side apples depending on enemy position.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nTarget (5, 7) first, then assess enemy path \u2014 enemy moving up left side may go for (2, 9) eventually, so maybe I should get (5, 7) then go to right-side apples to avoid competing for (2, 9) with enemy.

Next turn from (9, 4):  \n    - UP (9, 5): body deadly.  \n    - DOWN (9, 3): safe.  \n    - LEFT (8, 4): safe.  \n    - RIGHT: off board \u2192 deadly.  \n    2 safe moves \u2014 slightly constrained but can go DOWN or LEFT next turn.\n\n- UP (9, 6): no apple. Next turn from (9, 6):  \n    - UP (9, 7): safe.  \n    - DOWN (9, 5): body deadly.  \n    - LEFT (8, 6): safe.  \n    - RIGHT: off board \u2192 deadly.  \n    2 safe moves \u2014 also constrained, but moves away from apples.\n\n**5. Strategy:**  \nDOWN eats an apple immediately, increasing lead to 3 apples ahead of snake #0.  \nUP avoids immediate growth but doesn\u2019t help score.  \nGiven the board layout, after eating (9, 4), I can plan route toward (7, 0) or (5, 0) via LEFT and DOWN moves.  \nDOWN is clearly better \u2014 secure the apple now.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter DOWN to (9, 4), likely go LEFT to (8, 4) to open up path toward lower-left apples (7, 0) or (5, 0), avoiding getting trapped in top-right corner. Keep an eye on enemy movement \u2014 they are far but may head toward (7, 9) apple.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy snake #0** at (5, 8) \u2014 possible moves from (5, 8) last turn were DOWN (5, 7) or LEFT (4, 8).  \nNow (turn 54) I don\u2019t see new data for enemy position, but from the board they could be near top row.  \n\nBut more dangerous: enemy can move into cells I\u2019m considering.  \n\nFrom earlier turn their body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)].  \nSo head (5, 8):  \nPossible moves for enemy:  \n- UP (5, 9) \u2014 body \u274c  \n- DOWN (5, 7) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (4, 8) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (6, 8) \u2014 body \u274c  \n\nSo enemy could go to (4, 8) or (5, 7). That\u2019s not immediately threatening my safe moves now, since I\u2019m at (4,1).\n\n**4. Apples:** (4, 5), (0, 5), (3, 5), (6, 4), (4, 3)  \nClosest: (4, 3) Manhattan distance = |4-4| + |3-1| = 2 \u2014 very close.\n\n**5. Next move choice analysis:**  \n\n- **UP (4, 2)**: Puts me 1 step closer to (4, 3) and keeps open left, up, right next turn. Avoids going toward enemy. Good.  \n\n- **LEFT (3, 1)**: Moves away from (4, 3) but might be needed to approach (3, 5) or (0, 5) later? Less optimal for immediate apple.  \n\n- **DOWN (4, 0)**: Puts me near bottom edge, further from most apples, though safe.  \n\nUP is clearly the best for apple gathering.\n\n**6. Future mobility**:  \nFrom (4, 2):  \nPossible moves: UP (4, 3) \u2705, DOWN (4, 1) \u2705, LEFT (3, 2) \u2705, RIGHT (5, 2) \u2705 \u2192 4 moves safe next turn.  \n\nFrom (3, 1):  \nNext turn \u2014 UP (3, 2) \u2705, DOWN (3, 0) \u2705, LEFT (2, 1) \u2705, RIGHT (4, 1) \u2705 \u2014 also 4 moves safe. But not as direct for apples.\n\nSo UP both advances toward nearest apple and keeps mobility.\n\n**7. Head-on collision risk**: Enemy at (5, 8) moving either (5, 7) or (4, 8) \u2014 no chance of meeting me at (4, 2) this turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns**: Get apple at (4, 3) next turn if safe, then move toward (4, 5) or (3, 5). Keep enemy in peripheral awareness \u2014 they are far for now.\n\nUP",

Body: [(5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9)], Length = 10.  \n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (5, 4):\n- UP (5, 5) body \u274c  \n- DOWN (5, 3) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (4, 4) my body/tail  \u274c  \n- RIGHT (6, 4) empty \u2705  \nActually enemy cannot go LEFT because (4, 4) is part of my snake.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN (5, 3), RIGHT (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**3. Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nMy possible moves and overlaps with enemy\u2019s possible moves:\n- UP (3, 5): Enemy cannot reach (3, 5) in one move. Safe \u2705  \n- DOWN (3, 3): Enemy is at (5, 4); possible moves (5, 3) and (6, 4). (3,3) not in enemy moves. Safe \u2705  \n- LEFT (2, 4): Far enough from enemy moves. Safe \u2705  \n\nNo direct head-on collision risk this turn with any move.\n\n---\n\n**4. Eating apples:**  \nApples at: (4, 5), (0, 5), (3, 5), (6, 4), (9, 6).\n\nUP (3, 5) \u2192 eat apple.  \nOthers don\u2019t eat apple but keep me safe.\n\nEating apple at (3, 5) avoids giving it to enemy. They can\u2019t get it this turn anyway.\n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy\u2019s next possible moves and future risks:**  \nIf enemy goes DOWN (5, 3), they move away from me.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT (6, 4), apple at (6, 4) means enemy eats it and grows, possibly moving toward my future path.\n\nIf I eat (3, 5), I get longer, possibly blocking enemy later.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Surviving next turn after each move:**  \n\nFrom (3, 5) after UP:  \nPossible moves: UP (3, 6), DOWN (3, 4) (my neck but wait\u2014next body segment after move will be old head (3, 4)? Let\u2019s check: If I go UP to (3, 5), new body becomes [(3, 4), (4, 4), \u2026], so DOWN into (3, 4) is body  \u274c next turn, so 3 moves possible: UP, LEFT (2, 5), RIGHT (4, 5) (which might be apple). Dangerous if enemy moves to (4, 5)? No, enemy can\u2019t reach (3, 5) from (5, 3) or (6, 4) in next turn except\u2026 Wait, (6, 4) apple? If enemy goes there now, next turn enemy head at (6, 4): moves UP (6, 5), DOWN (6, 3), LEFT (5, 4), RIGHT (7, 4). (4, 5) not reachable by enemy next turn unless they are at (4, 4) but they can\u2019t go there. So relatively safe.\n\nFrom (3, 3) after DOWN: keeps options open but no apple.  \n\nFrom (2, 4) after LEFT: opens path to (0, 5) apple later but no immediate apple.\n\n---\n\n**7. Decision:**  \nBest to eat apple safely at (3, 5) since no current danger and it increases my lead (15\u219216). Keep enemy at 9. Also apple (3, 5) is near so securing it is good.\n\nPlan next: after eating at (3, 5), next turn go to (4, 5) if safe for another apple, or (2, 5) to avoid possible enemy path if they move toward center.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",
