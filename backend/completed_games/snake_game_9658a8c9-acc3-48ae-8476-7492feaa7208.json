Now that we're heading in the right direction, we need to think about how to navigate the board and avoid potential threats.\n\nSnake #0 is currently not in a position to intersect with us, but we'll need to keep an eye on it in case its trajectory changes. We should also remember that we're not alone on this board - there are other apples that could provide us with a good opportunity to grow.\n\nOne of those apples is at (5, 0), which is relatively far away from our current position, but we should keep it in mind as a potential target. However, our immediate goal is still to get closer to the apple at (2, 4).\n\nTaking a look at the board, we see that we're relatively close to that goal, but we're still a move or two away. The movement options that make sense to me are either moving down, which would put us directly under the apple, or moving right, which would potentially allow us to push snake #0 further away.\n\nUmm... Snake #0... yeah, let's keep it in mind, but for now, let's prioritize getting to that apple.\n\nIf I go down and intersect with the bottom of the apple, I'll be able to gain 1 point and extend my body. At that point, I'll have more options for where I can go and what I can do. If I fail, however, I risk running into snake #0 or the wall.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll be able to re-evaluate my strategy. But for now, let's keep moving down and hope for the best.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN.",
