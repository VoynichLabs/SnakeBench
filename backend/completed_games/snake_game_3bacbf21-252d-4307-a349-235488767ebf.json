Dies. \u274c Eliminated.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: Would move to (1, 3) - Safe, on board, no collision. \u2713 Viable.\n\n3. **UP**: Would move to (0, 4) - Safe, on board, no collision. \u2713 Viable.\n\n4. **DOWN**: Would move to (0, 2) - Safe, on board, no collision. \u2713 Viable.\n\n**Safe Moves:** RIGHT, UP, DOWN\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nLooking at apple positions:\n- (9, 3): Far right, same y as my current position\n- (3, 5): Closest apple, relatively nearby\n- (5, 5): Also reasonably close\n- (7, 8): Upper right area\n- (9, 9): Top right corner (where enemy is heading)\n\nThe closest apple cluster is at (3, 5) and (5, 5). To reach (3, 5), I need to move right and up.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moves me from (0, 3) to (1, 3) - progress toward (3, 5)\n- **UP**: Moves me from (0, 3) to (0, 4) - also progress toward (3, 5)\n- **DOWN**: Moves me from (0, 3) to (0, 2) - moves away from apples\n\n**Enemy Movement Consideration:**\nEnemy at (3, 9) will likely move toward (9, 9) apple or stay in that area. Moving RIGHT or UP keeps me away from potential collision with the enemy, who is in the upper portion of the board.\n\n**Best Move:** RIGHT is slightly better than UP because:\n1. It directly moves me closer to the apple at (3, 5) horizontally\n2. It keeps me in the lower half of the board, away from where the enemy is heading (upper right)\n3. It maintains flexibility for the next turn to move up or continue right\n\n**Long-term plan:** Focus on collecting the (3, 5) and (5, 5) apple cluster first. These are the closest apples and will help me grow. Once I've eaten one or two apples and grown larger, I'll be in a better position to evaluate competing for the right-side apples (9, 3) or (9, 9).\n\nRIGHT",

After this move I'll be at (2, 3), which is only 1 step away horizontally and 2 steps vertically from the apple at (3, 5). \u2713\n- **UP**: Also moves toward (3, 5), but moving right first seems more efficient given the horizontal distance.\n- **LEFT** or **DOWN**: Move away from the nearest apple cluster.\n\n**Best Move:** RIGHT - it directly advances toward the (3, 5) apple cluster with no downsides.\n\n**Long-term plan for next 3-4 turns:**\n1. Turn 2: Move RIGHT again to reach x=3\n2. Turn 3-4: Move UP twice to reach (3, 5) and collect first apple\n3. After collecting (3, 5), immediately pivot toward (5, 5) apple\n4. Monitor enemy position - currently at (2, 9) and likely moving toward (9, 9), so low collision risk\n\nRIGHT",
