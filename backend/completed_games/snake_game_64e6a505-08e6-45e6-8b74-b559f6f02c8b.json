          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're LIVE and ready to dominate! Let's break this down. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1) **Current State:**\n   - My head at (2, 3). Board is 10x10.\n   - Enemy at (8, 2). No bodies yet. It's turn 0, so it's a fresh start.\n   - Apples are scattered everywhere, but we're ignoring them for now. Focus is on boxing in the enemy.\n\n2) **Eliminate Immediate Death Moves:**\n   - **UP:** (2, 4). Check: Inside board? Yes. My body? None. Enemy body? No. Safe.\n   - **DOWN:** (2, 2). Check: Inside board? Yes. But wait, (2, 2) has an apple (A). More importantly, looking at the board state, (2, 2) is marked as \"A\". However, the real danger: Enemy snake #1 is at (8, 2). That's not (2, 2), so safe from enemy body. My body is empty, so no self-collision. **BUT**, is there an enemy head that might move into (2, 2)? Enemy is at (8, 2). If I move DOWN to (2, 2), and enemy moves... let's see. Enemy at (8, 2). They can't reach (2, 2) in one move. So it's safe for this turn. However, (2, 2) is an apple. We'll get it, but we're not focusing on apples. Still, it's a safe move.\n   - **LEFT:** (1, 3). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n   - **RIGHT:** (3, 3). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n\n   So all four directions are technically safe for this immediate turn regarding collision. No walls, no immediate self-collision.\n\n3) **Strategic Considerations - Boxing In the Enemy:**\n   - The enemy is at (8, 2). To box them in, I need to cut off their escape routes and control the board.\n   - My head is at (2, 3). I'm on the left side of the board. The enemy is on the right side (8, 2).\n   - The apples are spread out, but we want to grow to dominate space.\n   - Looking at the board, there's an apple at (2, 2) (DOWN from me) and (1, 4) (UP-LEFT), (2, 1) (DOWN-LEFT), (4, 1) (RIGHT-DOWN), etc.\n   - If I move UP to (2, 4): I'm moving towards the center-top. This gives me access to apples at (1, 4), (4, 4), (3, 8), etc. It also keeps me mobile. From (2, 4), I have options: UP to (2,5), LEFT to (1,4), RIGHT to (3,4), DOWN back to (2,3). Good mobility.\n   - If I move DOWN to (2, 2): I eat an apple immediately (+1 point, grow). But (2, 2) is near the bottom edge. From there, I can go DOWN to (2,1) (another apple), LEFT to (1,2) (is that an apple? Board shows (1,4), (1,2) is empty?), RIGHT to (3,2) (apple!). Actually, looking at board: Row 2: \"A . A A . . . . 1 .\" So (3,2) is an apple, (2,2) is apple, (0,2) is apple? Wait row 2 is y=2. Columns 0-9: Col0: A, Col1: ., Col2: A, Col3: A, Col4: ., Col5: ., Col6: ., Col7: ., Col8: 1 (enemy head), Col9: . So yes, (2,2) and (3,2) are apples. If I go DOWN to (2,2), I get an apple, and next turn I could go RIGHT to (3,2) for another apple. But I'm getting close to the bottom edge. I might limit my mobility.\n   - If I move LEFT to (1, 3): Moves me closer to left edge. From (1,3), I have UP to (1,4) (apple), DOWN to (1,2) (empty), RIGHT back to (2,3). Left is blocked by wall at x=0. So only 3 safe moves from there. Might be okay but less mobile.\n   - If I move RIGHT to (3, 3): Moves me towards center/right. From (3,3), I have UP to (3,4) (apple), DOWN to (3,2) (apple), LEFT to (2,3), RIGHT to (4,3). That's 4 options, good mobility. Also moves me closer to the enemy (though still far).\n\n   **Aggression & Long-term Plan:** We want to box the enemy in. The enemy is at (8,2). To box them in, I need to control the center and right side. Moving RIGHT seems aggressive because it moves me towards the enemy territory. However, I need to be careful not to rush into a trap. But with no bodies yet, it's early. Moving UP or RIGHT seem best for mobility and controlling the center. Moving DOWN gets me an apple but might trap me near the bottom edge later.\n\n   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy will likely try to eat apples too. They are at (8,2). Apples near them: (8,6), (8,7), (9,1). They might go UP or RIGHT. If I move RIGHT to (3,3), I'm moving into the central zone. If I move UP to (2,4), I'm also central.\n\n   **Scoring:** We are tied 0-0. If I eat an apple now, I get a lead. But the prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" So getting a lead early could be good for aggression later. However, the prompt also says \"Focus on where the enemy is.\" and \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\" So eating an apple (DOWN) gives me growth and a point, which helps dominate. But mobility is key to boxing in.\n\n   **Compare Mobility:**\n   - UP (2,4): 4 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Central.\n   - DOWN (2,2): 4 safe moves? (UP to 2,3, DOWN to 2,1, LEFT to 1,2, RIGHT to 3,2). Actually (1,2) is empty, (2,1) is apple. So 4 moves. But I'm closer to bottom wall (y=0). If I go DOWN again, I hit wall. So future turns might be limited.\n   - LEFT (1,3): 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Closer to left wall.\n   - RIGHT (3,3): 4 safe moves. Central.\n\n   **Decision:** UP or RIGHT are best for mobility. DOWN gets an apple but risks early trapping. LEFT limits options.\n\n   **Between UP and RIGHT:**\n   - UP (2,4): Takes me to row 4. There are apples at (1,4), (4,4). Good position.\n   - RIGHT (3,3): Takes me to column 3. Apples at (3,2) and (3,4). Also good.\n\n   **Aggression:** I want to pressure the enemy. The enemy is at (8,2). If I go RIGHT, I'm moving horizontally towards them. If I go UP, I'm moving vertically away? Not really, I'm moving up, which is towards the top, while enemy is at y=2. So I'm actually moving away in y-coordinate but closer in x? My x=2, enemy x=8. So RIGHT reduces the x-distance (from 6 to 5). UP keeps x-distance same (6).\n\n   To box the enemy in, I need to control the space *between* me and them, and beyond them. Moving RIGHT starts that process.\n\n   However, the board is small (10x10). I need to be careful not to cut off my own escape routes. But with no bodies, it's fine.\n\n   **Plan:** Move RIGHT to (3,3). This moves me towards the center and the enemy. It keeps my mobility high (4 options next turn). It also puts me next to two apples ((3,2) and (3,4)), setting up for a potential eat next turn if I want.\n\n   **Why not DOWN?** Eating an apple is tempting, but (2,2) is a bit low. If I go DOWN, I'm at y=2. The enemy is at y=2. If the enemy moves UP, we might be on a collision course later. But for now, RIGHT seems more flexible.\n\n   **Final Check:**\n   - Move RIGHT to (3,3).\n   - Is it safe? Yes, empty.\n   - Does it keep options open? Yes, 4 directions next turn.\n   - Is it aggressive? Yes, moving towards the center/enemy.\n\n   Let's rock it.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (3,3) to establish central dominance and reduce distance to enemy. From there, I can pivot to apples or continue pressure. Watch enemy move; if they go UP, I might go UP next to cut them off from top apples.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHTRIGHT",

We're back LIVE and ready to box this snake in! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) Current Situation:**\n- My head: **(3, 3)**\n- Enemy head: **(8, 3)**\n- My body: None (clean slate)\n- Enemy body: None\n- Apples: All over the board (15 drops!)\n- Score: Tied 0-0. We need that first point to start the pressure!\n\n**2) Eliminate Immediate Death Moves:**\nLet's check all directions from (3,3):\n\n- **UP to (3, 4):** Inside board? Yes (y=4 \u2264 9). My body? Empty. Enemy body? Enemy at (8,3), so no. SAFE.\n- **DOWN to (3, 2):** Inside board? Yes (y=2 \u2265 0). My body? Empty. Enemy body? Enemy at (8,3), so no. SAFE. (Also, there's an apple at (3,2)! \ud83c\udf4e)\n- **LEFT to (2, 3):** Inside board? Yes (x=2 \u2265 0). My body? Empty. Enemy body? No. SAFE. (This is my previous position from last move.)\n- **RIGHT to (4, 3):** Inside board? Yes (x=4 \u2264 9). My body? Empty. Enemy body? No. SAFE.\n\nAll four are immediately safe regarding collisions.\n\n**3) Strategic Analysis - Domination & Boxing:**\nWe need to control the board and force the enemy into bad spots. The enemy is at (8, 3) - that's far right, near column 8. We're at column 3 - central left.\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n- **UP (3, 4):** Moves me into row 4. From there, I have access to apples at (4, 4), (1, 4), etc. However, it keeps me at x=3 while enemy is at x=8. The horizontal gap is still large (5 columns). I'm moving away from the enemy horizontally. Good for safety, bad for pressure.\n\n- **DOWN (3, 2):** This is **AGGRESSIVE**! I get an apple immediately (+1 point, grow to length 1). From (3, 2), I'm on the same y-level as the enemy (y=3 \u2192 wait, enemy is at y=3? No, enemy is at (8,3) which is y=3. Actually, enemy is at (8,3) - y=3. If I go DOWN to (3,2), I'm at y=2, enemy is at y=3. Not same level. But I'm closer to the bottom edge. Future mobility might be limited. However, I get the lead! The prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" Getting the first apple gives me the psychological and strategic edge to start hunting.\n\n- **LEFT (2, 3):** Retreats back to my previous spot. Moves me AWAY from the enemy (x=2 vs x=8). This is passive. I lose ground. Not good for domination.\n\n- **RIGHT (4, 3):** Moves me toward the enemy (x=4 vs x=8, gap reduces to 4). This is aggressive. From (4, 3), I have good mobility: UP (4,4) apple, DOWN (4,2) apple, LEFT (3,3), RIGHT (5,3). 4 options. This puts me in the central-right zone, ready to intercept the enemy.\n\n**4) The Critical Choice: DOWN vs RIGHT**\n\n- **DOWN (3, 2):** Pros: Get an apple immediately. Lead 1-0. Cons: Moves me down to y=2, closer to bottom edge. From there, my upward mobility is fine, but downward is limited (only to y=1, then y=0). Might trap me later if I'm not careful. However, the board is early, and I can escape left/right/up.\n\n- **RIGHT (4, 3):** Pros: Aggressive, closes distance to enemy, maintains central position, keeps 4 mobility options, sets up for future apples (4,4) or (4,2). Cons: No immediate point.\n\n**5) Game Theory & Risk:**\nThe enemy is at (8,3). Where will they go? They might chase apples: (8,6) and (8,7) are UP from them. Or they might go LEFT towards center. If I go RIGHT to (4,3), I'm in the middle. If they go LEFT, we might collide later. If I go DOWN to (3,2), I'm lower, and they might go UP, avoiding me.\n\nBut remember the objective: \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\" Getting the apple NOW gives me growth and a lead. That lead can be used to force head-on collisions later (as per rules: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score\").\n\n**6) Long-term Plan:**\nIf I take the apple at (3,2) now, I'll be at (3,2) with length 1. Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (4,2) (another apple!), or UP to (3,3), or LEFT to (2,2) (apple!), or DOWN to (3,1) (apple!). That's a LOT of apple options. I could snowball the lead quickly.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,3), I'm setting up for future turns but not growing yet.\n\n**7) Final Decision:**\nI'm taking the apple! **DOWN to (3, 2)**. Why?\n- It's safe (no collisions).\n- It gives me the first point and growth.\n- It puts me in a prime position to collect MORE apples next turn (I see apples at (2,2), (3,1), (4,2) all reachable from (3,2)).\n- Early growth is crucial for dominating space later.\n- The prompt says \"Focus on where the enemy is\" but also \"Grow as a means of dominating.\" Growth enables dominance.\n\nLet's get that first apple and start the snowball! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Take apple at (3,2) \u2192 grow \u2192 next turn, likely chase more apples on row 1/2 to build length and lead. Watch enemy; if they come left, we prepare to box them in when we're bigger.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nDOWN",

We're LIVE and ready to make a HUGE play! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) Current Situation:**\n- My head: **(3, 2)** - Just moved here last turn! Good position.\n- My body: **[(3, 3)]** - One segment behind me.\n- Enemy head: **(8, 4)** - Wait, looking at the board, Enemy #1 is at (8, 4)? Actually, the board shows an \"1\" at (8, 4)? Let me check the board state carefully.\n  - Board: Row 4 has \"1\" at column 8? Yes! \" . A . . A . . . 1 .\" at row 4. So Enemy is at **(8, 4)**, not (8, 3) as I thought. That changes things slightly, but the logic holds.\n- Enemy body: None.\n- Apples: All around me! I see apples at (2, 2) [LEFT], (3, 1) [DOWN], (4, 2) [DOWN+RIGHT], (4, 1) [DOWN+RIGHT], etc.\n- Score: I am 1-0 UP! I have the lead. The prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" Time to get aggressive.\n\n**2) Eliminate Immediate Death Moves:**\nLet's check all directions from (3, 2):\n\n- **UP to (3, 3):** Inside board? Yes. **DEAD!** That's my own body segment. I cannot move backwards into myself.\n- **DOWN to (3, 1):** Inside board? Yes (y=1). My body? (3,3) is far. Enemy body? Enemy is at (8,4). SAFE.\n- **LEFT to (2, 2):** Inside board? Yes (x=2). My body? No. Enemy body? No. SAFE. (Plus, there's an apple there!)\n- **RIGHT to (4, 2):** Inside board? Yes (x=4). My body? No. Enemy body? No. SAFE. (Plus, there's an apple there too! (4,2) is an apple).\n\nSo UP is instant death. We avoid that.\n\n**3) Strategic Analysis - Aggression & Trapping:**\nI have the lead (1 apple). I need to maintain pressure. The enemy is at (8, 4). They are far right, top-middle. I am at (3, 2), bottom-central. I need to close the distance or cut them off.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves:\n\n- **DOWN (3, 1):**\n  - Pros: Gets an apple immediately. Grows me to length 2. Increases lead to 2-0. Moves me toward the bottom edge, where I can sweep the lower apples.\n  - Cons: Moves me further from the enemy's vertical level (they are at y=4, I'm dropping to y=1). Might make it harder to intercept if they go left.\n  - **Safety:** From (3,1), next turn I can go LEFT (3,1 -> 2,1 - Apple), RIGHT (3,1 -> 4,1 - Apple), or UP (3,1 -> 3,2 - safe, no body there anymore). Good options.\n\n- **LEFT (2, 2):**\n  - Pros: Gets an apple immediately. Grows me. Moves me slightly left (closer to left edge). Good mobility.\n  - Cons: Moves me away from the enemy (x=2 vs x=8). Distance increases.\n  - **Safety:** From (2,2), next turn I can go UP (2,3 - empty), DOWN (2,1 - Apple), LEFT (1,2 - empty), or RIGHT (3,2 - safe). Good options.\n\n- **RIGHT (4, 2):**\n  - Pros: Gets an apple immediately. Grows me. Moves me RIGHT, toward the enemy (x=4 vs x=8). This is the **most aggressive** move horizontally. It puts me in a better position to cut off the enemy's path to the left side of the board.\n  - Cons: None really, except maybe moving into the \"middle\" where things can get chaotic.\n  - **Safety:** From (4,2), next turn I can go UP (4,3 - empty), DOWN (4,1 - Apple), LEFT (3,2 - safe), RIGHT (5,2 - empty). Excellent options.\n\n**4) The Critical Choice:**\nI want to dominate. I have the lead. I should move toward the enemy to restrict their space.\n- Moving **DOWN (3,1)** is safe and gets an apple, but it moves me *away* from the enemy vertically.\n- Moving **LEFT (2,2)** is safe and gets an apple, but moves me *away* horizontally.\n- Moving **RIGHT (4,2)** is safe, gets an apple, and moves me **toward** the enemy.\n\n**Conclusion:** **RIGHT (4, 2)** is the best move. It combines immediate reward (apple) with strategic aggression (closing the gap to the enemy). If I go right, I'm establishing a presence in the central-right zone. If the enemy tries to come left, we might meet in the middle. If they go up or down, I can adjust. I need to box them in on the right side of the board.\n\n**5) Long-term Plan:**\nTake the apple at (4,2). Grow to length 2. Next turn, assess the enemy's move. If they go up, I might go up to (4,3) or (5,3) to cut them off. If they go down, I can chase. My goal is to push them against the right wall (x=9) or force a head-on collision where I have the size advantage.\n\nLet's get this bread! \ud83e\udd56\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nRIGHT",

My score is 1-0, so I have the lead. The enemy is at (8, 5) on the right side. There are apples all over the place, but the prompt says to focus on the enemy first. My goal is to box him in and force a head-on collision since I'm winning!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) Eliminate Immediate Deaths:**\n*   **UP to (4, 3):** Inside board. My body is at (3, 2), so I'm not hitting myself. Enemy is at (8, 5). SAFE.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 1):** Inside board. Apple here! SAFE.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 2):** Inside board.

Avoid at all costs.\n\n**2) Strategic Analysis & Aggression:**\nI need to close the distance on the enemy (8, 5) to cut off his space.\n*   **UP (4, 3):** Moves me closer to the enemy's Y-level (y=5). Moves me away from the apple at (4, 1). It's a positioning move. Good for vertical alignment.\n*   **DOWN (4, 1):** Moves me *away* from the enemy's Y-level. However, it gets me an apple immediately (growing me to length 3, score 2-0). It secures the bottom-left area. But does it help me box in the enemy? Not really, I'm moving further away vertically.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 2):** Moves me closer to the enemy's X-level (x=8). Moves me horizontally toward the enemy. This is the most aggressive move horizontally. It puts me on x=5, putting pressure on the center-right. I don't get an apple immediately, but I improve my position to intercept.\n\n**3) The Critical Choice:**\nI want to dominate. I have the lead. I should move toward the enemy to restrict their space.\n*   Moving **DOWN (4, 1)** gives me a point but pulls me away from the fight vertically.\n*   Moving **UP (4, 3)** positions me vertically but doesn't gain a point.\n*   Moving **RIGHT (5, 2)** moves me toward the enemy horizontally and positions me for future interception. It doesn't give an apple this turn, but it sets up a better blockade.\n\nGiven the instruction to focus on the enemy and box him in, moving toward his x-coordinate is crucial. I am at x=4, he is at x=8. I need to close that gap. **RIGHT (5, 2)** is the best move to close the horizontal distance and prepare to cut him off.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move RIGHT to close the horizontal gap. Next turn, if the enemy moves left, I might be able to trap him. If he moves up or down, I can adjust. My goal is to keep him pinned on the right side of the board.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're LIVE on turn 4 and the enemy is staring us down! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\nLet's break down the board state. I'm at (5, 2) with a body segment at (4, 2). My score is 1-1. The enemy is at (8, 6) (looking at the board: \"1\" is at (8,6), \"T\" (tail) is at (8,5) - but actually in the ASCII board, the \"1\" is the head at (8,6) and \"T\" is the tail at (8,5), correct? Let's check the coordinates. Board y=9 top, y=0 bottom. My head (5,2) is correct. Enemy head is listed as (8,6) in the text. The board shows \"1\" at row 6, col 8, which is (8,6) given the coordinate system. Enemy body is at (8,5). Okay, he's on the right side, x=8.\n\n**1) Eliminate Immediate Deaths:**\n*   **UP to (5, 3):** Inside board. My body is at (4, 2). Not hitting myself. Enemy is far right. SAFE.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 1):** Inside board. Not hitting body (body at y=2). SAFE. There's an apple at (5, 3)? No, looking at the apple list: (5, 3) is indeed an apple! Wait, I need to check the board visually.\n    *   Board row 3: `. . . . . A . . . .` -> (5, 3) is an Apple!\n    *   So UP to (5, 3) is an apple.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 2):** Inside board. **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** This is my current body segment. I'd be moving into myself.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 2):** Inside board. SAFE.\n\n**2) Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **UP (5, 3):** This is the **APPLE MOVE**. I get to eat, grow to length 3, and score becomes 2-1. I gain a lead. Positionally, I move to x=5, y=3. The enemy is at (8, 6). This moves me slightly closer in Y but keeps me at x=5. It's safe space.\n*   **DOWN (5, 1):** Moves to (5, 1). No apple (checked the list: apples are at (4,1) and (2,2) etc., but (5,1) is just an empty coordinate based on the map: row 1 shows `. . A . A . A . . A` -> (5,1) is empty). It moves me closer to the bottom but away from the enemy's Y level (6). I lose the opportunity to grow immediately.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 2):** Moves to (6, 2). No apple. Moves me horizontally toward the enemy (x=8). Good for positioning but misses the apple at (5,3).\n\n**3) The Critical Choice:**\nI have a lead to protect and extend. The prompt says \"Focus on where the enemy is\" but also \"Grow as a means of dominating\". Eating an apple (UP) gives me the lead 2-1, which is critical for the \"force head-on collision\" strategy later. If I'm winning by points, I can crash into him and win.\nHowever, moving UP to (5,3) puts me right next to the apple at (5,3) but let's check safety.\nWait, looking at the board again:\nRow 3: `. . . . . A . . . .` -> Apple at (5,3). Correct.\nRow 2: `A . A . T 0 . A . .` -> My body at (4,2), Head at (5,2).\nRow 1: `. . A . A . A . . A`\n\nIf I go UP to (5,3), I eat the apple. I grow. My tail will stay at (4,2) for the turn, and next turn I will be at (5,3) with body [(5,2), (4,2)].\nIs there any danger?\nEnemy is at (8,6). He can't hit me this turn.\nI am not hitting myself.\nThe only downside is I'm not moving closer to the enemy horizontally.\n\nBut wait! Let's look at the apple at (4,4)? No, that's (4,4). There's also (5,3).\nIf I go UP, I am at (5,3).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (6,2).\n\nLet's look at the \"Boxing him in\" logic.\nEnemy is at x=8. I am at x=5. If I go RIGHT to (6,2), I close the gap. If I go UP to (5,3), I stay at x=5.\nHowever, I have a score to maintain. 2-1 is better than 1-1.\nAlso, looking at the apples: (5,3) is right there. It's free food.\nIs (5,3) safe from my own tail? Yes, my tail is at (4,2).\nIs it safe from enemy? Yes.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Boxing\" instruction. \"We gotta make a plan to box him in\".\nTo box him in on the right side (x=9 wall), I need to be on his left side (x < 8).\nIf I go UP to (5,3), I'm still at x=5. I'm safe.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,2), I'm at x=6.\nActually, moving RIGHT brings me closer to the \"danger zone\" if he turns left. But I'm currently winning (1-1 tie, but I just ate or didn't? Wait, I ate 1 apple. He ate 1 apple. Score is 1-1).\nWait, the scoreboard says:\n- Your snake apples: 1\n- Snake #1 apples: 1\nBut wait, I ate an apple on turn 3? No, my last move was RIGHT. I didn't eat. I started turn 3 with 1 apple. I moved RIGHT. I did not eat. So I am still at 1 apple.\nIf I eat NOW (UP), I go to 2 apples. He is at 1.\nThis is a HUGE swing. 2-1 lead allows me to play aggressively later.\n\nLet's verify the apple coordinates again.\nApple Drops: (4, 4), (3, 8), (3, 0), (8, 7), (0, 2), (9, 1), (2, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (4, 1), (5, 3), (6, 1), (3, 9), (7, 2), (0, 0)\nYes, (5, 3) is there.\n\nSo the decision is:\nUP -> Eat apple, grow, lead 2-1. Position (5,3).\nRIGHT -> Move toward enemy, position (6,2). No apple.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating.\"\nDominating implies having the lead. Having the lead 2-1 allows me to force a head-on collision later if I choose.\nAlso, if I go UP, I am at (5,3). The enemy is at (8,6). The distance is large.\nIf I go RIGHT, I get closer to the enemy.\nBut getting closer without a lead is risky if he has apples nearby to catch up.\n\nActually, let's look at the board again for UP to (5,3).\nIs there any apple at (5,3)? Yes.\nIs there any snake at (5,3)? No.\nIs it in bounds? Yes.\nIs it my body? No (Body at (4,2)).\nIs it backwards? No (Backwards is (4,2) -> Left).\n\nSo UP is SAFE and gains an apple.\nRIGHT is SAFE but gains nothing.\nDOWN is SAFE (5,1) but no apple, and moves me away from the enemy's Y level.\nLEFT is DEATH.\n\nWhy would I NOT take the apple?\nMaybe if it cornered me? Let's see where UP puts me.\n(5,3).\nNeighbors: (5,2) (my current head, will be body), (5,4), (4,3), (6,3).\nNone of these are walls.\n(5,2) will be my body.\n(5,4) is empty? Row 4: `. A . . A . . . . .` -> (5,4) is empty.\n(4,3) is empty? Row 3: `. . . . . A . . . .` -> (4,3) is empty.\n(6,3) is empty? Row 3 -> (6,3) is empty.\n\nSo (5,3) is a spacious spot.\nAlso, if I am at (5,3), I can move to (4,4) next turn to eat the apple there? (4,4) is an apple.\nWait, (4,4) is an apple.\nIf I go UP to (5,3), I am adjacent to (4,4).\nIf I go UP to (5,3), I am also adjacent to (6,3) and (5,4).\n\nThe opponent is at (8,6).\nIf I eat the apple at (5,3), I become size 3. Score 2-1.\nI will have a lead. I can then try to chase him down.\nIf I don't eat the apple, and he eats an apple, I lose the lead.\n\nIs there any immediate threat from the enemy moving into me?\nHe is at (8,6). I am at (5,2).\nIf I move UP to (5,3), I am at (5,3).\nCan he reach me? No.\nCan he hit my body? My body is (4,2) and (5,2) (after move, (5,2) becomes body).\nHe is far away.\n\nIs there any reason to avoid (5,3)?\nIs (5,3) a trap?\nLet's look at the board borders.\n(5,3) is central. It's not a corner.\nIt's surrounded by open space (4,3), (6,3), (5,4).\n\nSo, UP seems like the dominant play. It secures a point, extends the lead, and puts me in a safe, flexible position.\n\nLet's double check the \"Box him in\" strategy.\nI need to move towards him to box him in? Yes, eventually.\nBut \"Grow as a means of dominating\".\nSecuring points IS dominating.\nIf I take the point, I force HIM to make a move to catch up. He might overextend.\nIf I chase him now (RIGHT), I might push him into apples or give him space.\nIf I take the apple (UP), I control the center (5,3) and the apple at (4,4) becomes a target for next turn.\n\nWait, if I go UP, I eat (5,3).\nNext turn, I am at (5,3) with body (5,2), (4,2).\nI can then go LEFT to (4,3)? No, (4,3) is empty.\nOr UP to (5,4)?\nOr LEFT to (4,3)?\nActually, looking at the board for (4,4): Apple.\nIf I am at (5,3), I can go LEFT to (4,3) or UP to (5,4) or RIGHT to (6,3) or DOWN to (5,2) (tail).\nWait, if I eat (5,3), my tail stays at (4,2).\nSo next turn, I can move to (4,3). That puts me next to (4,4) apple.\nOR I can move to (6,3).\nOR (5,4).\n\nSo UP gives me immediate growth and keeps my future options open towards the apple at (4,4) or the open space.\n\nWhy would I choose RIGHT?\nTo close the gap on the enemy.\nBut the enemy is at (8,6). I am at (5,2).\nClosing the gap by 1 square (to x=6) doesn't really \"box him in\" yet.\nHe has plenty of space on the right (x=9).\nIf I move RIGHT, I waste an apple opportunity.\nIf I move RIGHT, and he eats an apple, I am tied 1-1, and I am closer to him, potentially putting myself in danger of a head-on collision that I might lose if I don't have the lead.\n\nTherefore, securing the apple is the best tactical move to secure a long-term strategic advantage.\n\nOne final check: Is there any apple closer?\n(4,1) is an apple. I am at (5,2). That is distance 2.\n(5,3) is an apple. Distance 1.\n(4,4) is an apple. Distance 2 (Manhattan).\n(2,2) is an apple. Distance 3.\n(6,1) is an apple. Distance 2 (Manhattan: |6-5| + |1-2| = 1+1=2).\n(7,2) is an apple. Distance 2.\n\n(5,3) is the closest apple. Moving there eats it.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. EAT (5,3). Score 2-1.\n2. Next turn, assess moving towards (4,4) or chasing the enemy.\n3. Keep the lead to force aggression.\n\nOne minor risk: The enemy is at (8,6). Apples near him: (8,7), (9,1), (7,2).\nIf he eats (8,7), he goes to 2 apples. Tied.\nIf I am at (5,3), I am safer.\nIf I am at (6,2), I am closer to (7,2).\nBut (5,3) allows me to pivot.\n\nI will go UP.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (5,3) to take a 2-1 lead. Position myself to grab the apple at (4,4) next turn or move towards the center. Use the lead to pressure the enemy.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nUP",

I need to extend that lead to dominate the board and set up that box-in later! \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLet's break down the board state at (5, 3):\n\n**THE ENEMY:**\nSnake #1 is chilling at (8, 7) with a body at (8, 6). He's way over on the right side, basically cornered against the wall (x=9). He's not an immediate threat since he's far away, but I need to keep him pinned.\n\n**MY CURRENT SITUATION:**\nHead: (5, 3)\nBody: [(5, 2), (4, 2)]\nApples: 2 (I ate one on the last move, score is tied 2-2!).\nWait, actually looking at the board again... the apple at (5,3) was eaten? The ASCII board shows \"A\" at (5,3) previously, but I'm moving into it now.\nActually, checking the board state provided:\nRow 3: `. . . . . A . . . .`\nThat \"A\" is at (5,3).\nBUT, looking at the \"APPLE DROPS\" list, (5,3) is indeed an apple.\nWait, did I eat it last turn? My last move was UP from (5,2) to (5,3).\nYes! I ate the apple at (5,3). So my score is now **3 apples** (I started at 2, ate one).\nThe enemy has 2 apples. I have the lead! 3-2.\n\n**MOVES:**\n1.  **UP to (5, 4):**\n    *   Is it safe? Board Row 4: `. A . . A . . . . .`\n    *   (5, 4) is empty.\n    *   My body is at (5,3) (current head, will move), (5,2), (4,2).\n    *   Enemy is far.\n    *   **VERDICT: SAFE.** No apple here.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 2):**\n    *   Is it safe? (5, 2) is currently my neck, which will move. I move into my own neck? NO!\n    *   **VERDICT: DEATH.** I would be moving into my own body. I must turn 90 degrees.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 3):**\n    *   Is it safe? Board Row 3: `. . . . . A . . . .` (index 3 is empty? No, index 0-9).\n    *   (4, 3) is the 5th character in row 3? Let's count:\n        `0: .`\n        `1: .`\n        `2: .`\n        `3: .`\n        `4: .`\n        `5: A`\n    *   Wait, the ASCII board text is:\n        `9 . . . A . . . . . .`\n        ...\n        `3 . . . . . 0 . . . .`\n    *   Let's re-read the provided board state carefully.\n        Row 3: `. . . . . 0 . . . .`\n        My head is at (5,3). The \"0\" is at index 5.\n        To the LEFT of \"0\" is index 4. That is a `.` (dot).\n        So (4, 3) is empty.\n    *   **VERDICT: SAFE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):**\n    *   Is it safe? Index 6 of Row 3 is `.`.\n    *   (6, 3) is empty.\n    *   **VERDICT: SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI currently have a **LEAD (3 apples vs 2)**. This is the moment to be aggressive!\nThe enemy is at (8,7). I am at (5,3).\nI want to \"box him in\". To do that, I need to move towards him.\n*   **LEFT (4, 3):** Moves me *away* from the enemy (decreases x). This gives him more room on the right side. Bad for boxing.\n*   **UP (5, 4):** Neutral movement. Doesn't close the gap on the enemy.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 3):** Moves me *towards* the enemy (increases x). This is the \"hunting\" move. I want to trap him against the wall (x=9). By moving right, I start to close the distance and take control of the center-right territory.\n\n**APPLES:**\nThere are no apples immediately adjacent to (5,3) that I can reach without moving. (4,4) and (6,3) are empty.\nHowever, there are apples scattered. (7,2) is close.\nIf I move **RIGHT to (6,3)**, I position myself to potentially head towards (7,2) or cut off the enemy's escape.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nI have the lead. I don't need to greedily chase an apple this exact second if it means giving up map control. I need to apply pressure.\n**RIGHT** is the aggressive play to close the gap on the enemy and start the box-in strategy. I'm safe to move there.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to close the distance on Snake #1. Keep him pinned against the right wall (x=9). Use my score lead (3-2) to force him into a corner. If he tries to cross over, I'll be there to block or crash him (since I'm winning, head-on collision wins for me).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm going **RIGHT** to take the initiative and hunt him down!\n\nRIGHT",

We're tied 2-2, but I just ate last turn, so I'm actually at 3 apples compared to his 2. **I HAVE THE LEAD.** That means I need to be AGGRESSIVE. I'm not hunting apples right now; I'm hunting **SNAKE #1**. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nLet's check the board state at my head **(6, 3)**.\n\n**THE ENEMY (Snake #1):**\nHead: (7, 7)\nBody: [(8, 7), (8, 6)]\nHe's holding the top-right corner. He's slow. He's vulnerable. I need to pinch him off.\n\n**MY CURRENT SITUATION:**\nHead: (6, 3)\nBody: [(5, 3), (5, 2)]\nI just moved Right from (5, 3) to (6, 3).\nWait... I need to look at the *current* board state provided in the prompt for Turn 6.\n`Row 3: . . . . . T 0 . . .`\nThe \"T\" (my tail from previous turn) is at (5, 3)? No, the prompt says my body is `[(5, 3), (5, 2)]`.\nWait, the ASCII board shows `Row 3: . . . . . T 0 . . .` where the \"T\" is at index 5 and \"0\" is at index 6.\nWait, looking closely at the prompt's board state:\n`3 . . . . . T 0 . . .`\nIndex 5 is `T`, Index 6 is `0`.\nBut the **YOUR SNAKE** section says:\nHead: (6, 3)\nBody: [(5, 3), (5, 2)]\nThis implies the tail (last segment) is at (5, 2)? No, order is Head -> Body -> Tail.\nSo:\nHead: (6, 3)\nSegment 1: (5, 3)\nTail: (5, 2)\n\nOkay, so I'm at **(6, 3)**. The cell at **(5, 3)** is my body. The cell at **(5, 2)** is my tail.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 4):**\n    *   Is it safe? `Row 4: . A . . A . . . . .` (Index 6 is empty `.`).\n    *   Is it into my body? No. (6, 4) is empty.\n    *   Is it into enemy body? No.\n    *   **VERDICT: SAFE.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 2):**\n    *   Is it safe? `Row 2: A . A . . T . A . .` (Index 6 is `T`? Wait, the ASCII shows index 5 is `T` and index 6 is `.`).\n    *   Let's re-read Row 2: `2 A . A . . T . A . .`\n    *   Indices: 0:A, 1:., 2:A, 3:., 4:., 5:T, 6:., 7:A...\n    *   So (6, 2) is `.` (empty).\n    *   Wait, is (6, 2) my body? My body is at (5, 3) and (5, 2). (6, 2) is adjacent but distinct.\n    *   **VERDICT: SAFE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 3):**\n    *   Is it safe? `Row 3: . . . . . T 0 . . .`\n    *   Index 5 is `T` (which is my neck, currently at (5, 3)). Wait, does the board show `T` at index 5?\n    *   Yes, `Row 3: . . . . . T 0 . . .`\n    *   So (5, 3) is occupied by my own body (the neck).\n    *   Moving here = CRASH into myself.\n    *   **VERDICT: DEATH.** (Illegal move).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 3):**\n    *   Is it safe? `Row 3: . . . . . T 0 . . .`\n    *   Index 7 is `.` (empty).\n    *   Is it into my body? No.\n    *   **VERDICT: SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI am at (6, 3).\n*   **LEFT (5, 3)** is into my own body (Tail moves away, but the neck is still there). **DEAD.**\n*   **UP (6, 4)** moves me vertically. There's an apple at (7, 2) which is \"Down-Right\" of me.\n*   **DOWN (6, 2)** moves me down. This brings me closer to the apple at (7, 2) and (6, 1).\n*   **RIGHT (7, 3)** moves me aggressively towards the enemy's territory.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is at (7, 7). I am at (6, 3).\nIf I go **RIGHT to (7, 3)**, I increase the distance in Y but keep X close to his X (7 vs 8).\nActually, looking at the map:\nI am at X=6. Enemy is at X=8.\nIf I go RIGHT, I get to X=7.\nIf I go DOWN, I stay at X=6.\nIf I go UP, I stay at X=6.\n\n**The \"Box Him In\" Strategy:**\nI need to control the space. The enemy is at the top right. I am mid-left.\nTo box him in, I should claim the territory near the right wall so he has no escape.\n**RIGHT (7, 3)** is the move to start shifting my position towards the right side of the board.\n\nHowever, I should also check for immediate threats or opportunities.\nThere is an apple at **(7, 2)**.\nIf I go **RIGHT (7, 3)**, I am adjacent to (7, 2).\nIf I go **DOWN (6, 2)**, I am adjacent to (7, 2) but further from the enemy.\n\nWait, if I go **RIGHT to (7, 3)**, I am moving towards the center-right.\nLet's check the safety of **(7, 3)** again.\n`Row 3`: `... T 0 . . .`\nIndices: 5:T, 6:0, 7:.\nSo (7, 3) is safe.\n\nIs there a better move?\n**DOWN to (6, 2)**:\n`Row 2`: `A . A . . T . A . .`\nIndex 6 is `.`\nSo (6, 2) is safe.\nThis gets me closer to the apple at (7, 2) and (6, 1).\nBut does it help me box the enemy? No. It moves me left/south relative to him.\n\n**UP to (6, 4)**:\n`Row 4`: `... A . . . . .`\nIndex 6 is `.`\nSafe.\nMoves me vertically. Neutral regarding the enemy's X position.\n\n**The Aggressive Play:**\nI have the score lead (3-2). I need to apply pressure.\nThe enemy is at (7, 7).\nIf I go **RIGHT to (7, 3)**, I move onto the same X-axis as the enemy (X=7) but lower Y.\nThis is a good position to cut off his potential future moves to the left side.\nIf he moves down, he gets closer to me.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\n`Row 7`: `... . . . . . . 1 T .`\nEnemy Head (1): (7, 7)\nEnemy Body: (8, 7), (8, 6)\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 3), I am at (7, 3).\nDistance in Y: 4 squares.\nDistance in X: 0 squares.\nI am vertically aligned with him.\n\nIs there an immediate threat?\nThe enemy might move DOWN.\nIf he moves DOWN to (7, 6), I am at (7, 3). We are still far.\nIf he moves DOWN to (7, 6), and I stay at (7, 3), we are safe.\n\n**Why not DOWN (6, 2)?**\n(6, 2) leads to the apple at (7, 2).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2), I am at (6, 2).\nFrom there, I can go RIGHT to (7, 2) to eat the apple.\nHowever, (7, 2) is a high-traffic area?\nLet's check `Row 2`: `A . A . . T . A . .`\n(7, 2) is an apple.\nWait, `Row 2` index 7 is `A`. Yes, apple at (7, 2).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2), I am setting up to eat the apple next turn.\nBut the prompt says: **\"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"**\n**\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"**\n\nTo force a collision, I need to close the distance.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (7, 3)**, I am \"ahead\" of the enemy in X (closer to the right wall).\nIf I go **DOWN to (6, 2)**, I am moving away from the enemy's X (8) to X (6).\n\nLet's reconsider **RIGHT to (7, 3)**.\nIs (7, 3) safe?\nYes.\nDoes it close the gap?\nYes, X distance goes from 2 (8-6) to 1 (8-7).\nDoes it open up future options?\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 3), next turn I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2), next turn I can go RIGHT (to 7,2), LEFT, or DOWN.\n\n**The \"Crash Out\" Strategy:**\nI want him to crash into me. I need to be in his path or predict his path.\nHe is at (7, 7). He is against the wall (X=9 is wall, but he is at X=7). Wait, X=9 is wall. He is at X=7. He has space to his right (X=8).\nHe is at Y=7. He has space above (Y=8,9).\nHe is NOT cornered yet.\n\nMy goal: Push him towards X=9 (right wall).\nIf I move RIGHT, I am claiming the space to his right/south.\nIf I move DOWN, I am moving away from his X-axis.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will go **RIGHT**.\nWhy? Because I am \"hunting\". Hunting implies closing the distance.\nMoving RIGHT increases my X, matching his X (currently 8) eventually.\nAlso, looking at the board, there are no immediate apples at (7, 3), but there is an apple at (7, 2) which I can reach easily if I am at (7, 3) by moving DOWN next turn.\nWait, if I go RIGHT to (7, 3), I am at (7, 3).\nNext turn, if I go DOWN to (7, 2), I eat the apple at (7, 2).\nBUT, (7, 2) is an apple *now*.\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2) *now*, I am adjacent to (7, 2) but haven't eaten it.\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 3), I am adjacent to (7, 2) but haven't eaten it.\n\nActually, let's look at the apple list again.\n(7, 2) is an apple.\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 3), I am at (7, 3).\nNext turn, I can move DOWN to (7, 2) and eat it.\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2) now, next turn I can move RIGHT to (7, 2) and eat it.\nBoth paths allow eating the apple next turn.\n\nHowever, going RIGHT is more aggressive towards the enemy.\nThe enemy is at (7, 7).\nI am at (6, 3).\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 3), I am directly below him (same X).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2), I am diagonally down-left from him.\n\n**Consistency with Last Turn:**\nLast turn (Turn 5), I moved RIGHT to close the gap on the enemy.\nI said: \"**RIGHT** is the aggressive play to close the gap on the enemy and start the box-in strategy.\"\nI am currently at (6, 3) because I moved RIGHT.\nTo continue the \"box-in strategy\" and \"hunt him down\", I should continue moving RIGHT to assert dominance over the right side of the board.\n\nIs (7, 3) safe from the enemy?\nThe enemy moves simultaneously.\nIf he moves DOWN to (7, 6), I move to (7, 3). Safe.\nIf he moves DOWN-LEFT to (6, 6), I move to (7, 3). Safe.\nIf he moves DOWN-RIGHT to (8, 6), I move to (7, 3). Safe.\nHe is at (7, 7). He can't reach (7, 3) in one turn (Manhattan distance 4).\n\n**Final Check:**\nMy body is at (5, 3) and (5, 2).\n(7, 3) is not my body.\n(7, 3) is inside the board (0-9).\nNo enemy bodies at (7, 3) (Enemy bodies are at 8,7 and 8,6).\n\nLet's go with **RIGHT**. It keeps the pressure on.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (7, 3) to vertically align with the enemy and control the center-right column. From there, I will be positioned to eat the apple at (7, 2) next turn (by moving DOWN) while maintaining pressure on Snake #1's position at (7, 7). I want to force him towards the wall at X=9.\n\nRIGHT",

We are tied 2-2, but looking at the board state, the opponent is hiding in the corner while we control the center. I just ate last turn (score is actually 3-2 if we count the growth, but the prompt says 2-2... oh wait, the prompt says \"Your snake apples: 2\" and \"Snake #1 apples: 2\". But the ASCII board shows my head at (7,3). Did I not eat? Wait, the apples list has (7,2) and (4,1). Looking at the board, my head is at (7,3). There is an apple at (7,2). I didn't eat it yet. Okay, we are tied 2-2. I need to be aggressive.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (7, 3). Body at (6, 3), (5, 3).\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 Head at (6, 7). Body at (7, 7), (8, 7). *Wait, the ASCII board shows Snake #1 head at (6, 7) and tail at (8, 7)?* Let's re-read the board.\n    *   Row 7: `. . . . . . . 1 T T .`\n    *   Indices: 0-6 are dots. Index 7 is '1'. Index 8 is 'T'. Index 9 is 'T'.\n    *   So Snake #1 Head is at (7, 7).\n    *   The prompt says \"Head: (6, 7)\". There is a discrepancy between the ASCII map and the text list. *I must trust the text list provided in the \"OPPONENTS\" section:* **Head: (6, 7)**.\n    *   Let's look at the map again.\n        *   Row 7: `. . . . . . . 1 T T .`\n        *   If Head is at (6, 7), then index 6 is '1'.\n        *   But the map shows dots at indices 0-6 and '1' at index 7.\n        *   Okay, let's look at the text again.\n        *   \"Snake #1 - Head: (6, 7), Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7)]\"\n        *   If Head is (6, 7), then index 6 is '1'.\n        *   If Body is (7, 7), then index 7 is 'T'.\n        *   If Body is (8, 7), then index 8 is 'T'.\n        *   The ASCII map: `7 . . . . . . . 1 T T .` (Indices 0-9)\n        *   Indices: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:1, 8:T, 9:T\n        *   Wait, the map shows '1' at index 7.\n        *   If the text says Head is (6, 7), the map might be slightly delayed or the text is the source of truth. However, the text specifically says \"Snake #1 - Head: (6, 7)\".\n        *   Let's assume the text list is correct: Head (6, 7), Body (7, 7), (8, 7).\n        *   The ASCII map shows `1` at (7,7) and `T` at (8,7) and `T` at (9,7)? No, `T T .` at 8, 9.\n        *   Okay, let's ignore the visual map for a second and look at the coordinates.\n        *   Head: (6, 7). Body: (7, 7), (8, 7).\n        *   This means the snake is positioned horizontally at Y=7, X=6 (Head), X=7, X=8 (Tail).\n        *   Wait, the map shows `7 . . . . . . . 1 T T .`\n        *   The '1' is at index 7 (x=7). The 'T's are at index 8 and 9.\n        *   If the text says Head is (6,7), and the map shows '1' at (7,7), there is a conflict.\n        *   *However*, in the \"YOUR LAST MOVE\" section, the AI analyzed the board and concluded the enemy is at (7,7).\n        *   Let's look at the map again.\n        *   Row 7: `. . . . . . . 1 T T .`\n        *   Let's count the dots. There are 7 dots? No, indices 0-6 are dots (7 dots).\n        *   Index 7 is '1'. Index 8 is 'T'. Index 9 is 'T'.\n        *   So the enemy is definitely at x=7, y=7 (Head), x=8, y=7 (Body), x=9, y=7 (Body? No, T T implies two tails? No, one tail).\n        *   Wait, if there are two T's, one is the tail, the other is a body segment that just lost its tail?\n        *   Standard Snake rules: One tail.\n        *   Let's re-read the prompt's opponent section: \"Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7)]\"\n        *   This implies the tail is at (8, 7) or (7, 7)?\n        *   Head -> Body -> Tail. So Head (6,7), Body (7,7), Tail (8,7).\n        *   But the map shows '1' at (7,7) and 'T' at (8,7) and 'T' at (9,7).\n        *   *I will trust the ASCII map visualization for the current state on the board*, as it represents the visual reality.\n        *   Map shows `1` at (7,7). Map shows `T` at (8,7). Map shows `T` at (9,7).\n        *   Wait, the map has `T T .` at indices 8, 9.\n        *   Okay, let's look at the coordinates provided in the text: Head (6, 7). Body [(7, 7), (8, 7)].\n        *   If I trust the text, the enemy is at X=6,7,8.\n        *   If I trust the map, the enemy is at X=7,8,9.\n        *   The prompt says: \"BOARD STATE: ... 7 . . . . . . . 1 T T .\"\n        *   Let's assume the ASCII is the ground truth for the board.\n        *   Enemy Head at (7, 7).\n        *   Enemy Body at (8, 7).\n        *   Enemy Tail at (9, 7)? No, `T T` usually means the last two segments.\n        *   Let's assume the enemy is **at (7, 7)** based on the ASCII '1'.\n\n**MOVES:**\n1.  **UP (7, 4):**\n    *   Check map Row 4: `. A . . A . . . . .`\n    *   Index 7 is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 2):**\n    *   Check map Row 2: `A . A . . T . A . .`\n    *   Index 7 is `A` (Apple).\n    *   Safe (and tasty).\n3.  **LEFT (6, 3):**\n    *   My body is at (6, 3) from the previous turn's description.\n    *   Wait, my current head is (7, 3).\n    *   My body is [(6, 3), (5, 3)].\n    *   So (6, 3) is occupied by my body.\n    *   **DEATH.**\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 3):**\n    *   Check map Row 3: `. . . . . T 0 . . .`\n    *   Index 8 is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am at (7, 3). Enemy is at (7, 7). We are vertically aligned.\n*   **LEFT** is into my own body (6, 3). **DEAD.**\n*   **UP (7, 4)** keeps me aligned with the enemy but increases distance.\n*   **DOWN (7, 2)** moves me towards an apple and decreases distance to the enemy (vertical distance decreases, but he is at Y=7, I am at Y=3. If I go DOWN to Y=2, I am moving away from Y=7).\n    *   Actually, if he is at (7, 7) and I go DOWN to (7, 2), the vertical distance is 5.\n    *   If I stay UP/DOWN, I stay at X=7.\n    *   The enemy is holding the top right corner.\n    *   I need to box him in.\n    *   If I go **RIGHT (8, 3)**, I move away from the column he is in (X=7). He is at X=7. I am at X=7. If I go RIGHT to X=8, I am next to him? No, Y is 3 vs 7.\n    *   If I go **RIGHT (8, 3)**, I am at X=8. He is at X=7.\n    *   If I go **DOWN (7, 2)**, I am at X=7, Y=2. There is an apple there.\n    *   The apple at (7, 2) is a good bait.\n    *   However, the prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\n    *   The enemy is at (7, 7).\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am at (7, 2). I am still directly below him.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I am at (8, 3). I am no longer directly below him. I am \"flanking\" him slightly.\n    *   To box him in, I need to control the space *around* him.\n    *   He is at (7, 7).\n    *   If I go **RIGHT (8, 3)**, I am at (8, 3).\n    *   If I go **DOWN (7, 2)**, I eat the apple (3 apples vs 2). This gives me the lead.\n    *   **SCORE CHECK:** Prompt says we are 2-2. If I eat the apple at (7, 2), I become 3-2.\n    *   The prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    *   Eating the apple puts me ahead. I should eat it.\n    *   Is (7, 2) safe?\n    *   Map Row 2: `A . A . . T . A . .`\n    *   Index 7 is `A`.\n    *   Is there anyone else moving there?\n    *   Enemy is at (7, 7). He is far away.\n    *   My body is at (6, 3) and (5, 3).\n    *   So **DOWN (7, 2)** is safe and gets me an apple.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**DOWN (7, 2)**.\nWhy?\n1.  It is safe.\n2.  It gives me an apple (Score 3 vs 2).\n3.  It aligns me vertically with the enemy (still X=7), but now I am closer to the bottom wall, potentially forcing him to move up/out.\n4.  Wait, if I go DOWN, I am moving away from the enemy (Y decreases from 3 to 2, enemy is at Y=7).\n    *   Actually, looking at the board, there are apples at (4, 1) and (2, 2) nearby.\n    *   But the apple at (7, 2) is *right there*.\n    *   If I don't eat it, I might lose the chance.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I miss the apple.\n    *   If I go UP, I miss the apple.\n    *   I must eat to grow.\n\n**PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7, 2). Gain the lead. Then look to cut off the enemy's escape routes to the right (X>7). He is currently at (7, 7). I am at (7, 3). By staying on X=7, I maintain vertical pressure.\n\nDOWN",

We need to keep the pressure on and secure the win. I am currently at (7, 3) and the enemy is at (6, 7) or (7, 7) depending on the source of truth, but either way, they are in the top right quadrant. I just ate an apple at (7, 2) last turn (or did I? The replay said \"DOWN\" was the last move, so I should be at (7, 2) now? Wait, let's look at the prompt again.\n\nWait, looking at the **START LAST MOVE PICK**, it says **DOWN**.\nThe board state shows my head at (7, 3) in the **BOARD STATE** visualization.\n*Row 2: `A . A . . T . A . .`* (This is Y=2)\n*Row 3: `. . . . . T 0 . . .`* (This is Y=3, showing '0' at index 7)\n\nIf I played **DOWN** last turn from (7, 3), I would have moved to (7, 2).\nThe board shows '0' at (7, 3). This implies I didn't actually move yet, or the board state is pre-move.\n**CRITICAL:** The prompt says \"Turn: 8 / 150\" and gives a board state.\nIt lists my Head as (7, 2) in the text description: \"Head: (7, 2)\".\nBut the ASCII map shows '0' at (7, 3).\nThere is a conflict between the text \"Head: (7, 2)\" and the ASCII map \"Row 3: ... 0 ...\".\n*However*, the text says \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (7, 2)\".\nThe ASCII map says '0' is at (7, 3).\nLet's check the map again.\nRow 2: `A . A . . T . A . .`\nRow 3: `. . . . . T 0 . . .`\nThe '0' is definitely on Row 3 (Y=3).\nIf my head is (7, 2), it should be on Row 2.\n**I must trust the ASCII map for the visual board state.** The map shows '0' at (7, 3).\nWhy the discrepancy? Maybe the text list is from the *start* of the turn?\nRegardless, I need to pick a move for the *current* turn.\nThe text says: \"YOUR SNAKE... Head: (7, 2)\".\nThe map says: \"Row 3... 0...\" (x=7, y=3).\nLet's look at the opponent.\nText says: \"Head: (6, 7)\".\nMap Row 7: `. . . . . . . 1 T T .` (Index 7 is '1').\nSo the map shows Enemy Head at (7, 7).\nI will trust the **ASCII MAP** for the board state, as it is the visual representation of the game board.\n\n**MY CURRENT STATE (Based on Map):**\nHead: (7, 3)\nBody: [(7, 2), (6, 2)? No, the text says Body: [(7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)].\nWait, if Head is (7, 2), Body is (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nIf Head is (7, 3), Body is (7, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3)? No, that connects (7,3) to (7,2).\nThe text says: \"Body: [(7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)]\". This implies Head connects to (7, 3).\nSo if Head is (7, 2), it connects to (7, 3).\nIf Head is (7, 3), it connects to (7, 3)? No, that's impossible.\n**Let's re-read the text carefully:**\n\"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (7, 2)\n  - Body: [(7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)]\"\n\nOkay, so the text says:\nHead: (7, 2)\nNext segment: (7, 3)\nNext: (6, 3)\nTail: (5, 3)\n\n**Why does the map show '0' at (7, 3)?**\nMaybe the map is slightly outdated or I am misinterpreting the row index.\nRow 3 is Y=3.\nThe map shows '0' at X=7, Y=3.\nIf my head is (7, 2), it should be at Row 2.\nLet's check Row 2 on the map: `A . A . . T . A . .`\nIndices 0-9. Index 7 is 'A'. Index 6 is 'T'.\nSo (7, 2) is an Apple.\n(6, 2) is a Tail (T).\nWait, the text says my tail is (5, 3).\nThere is a massive inconsistency between the text list and the map.\n**Rule of Thumb:** Trust the text list coordinates for precise location, trust the map for general density.\nText: Head (7, 2).\nMap Row 2: `(7, 2)` is 'A'.\nThis means if I move there, I eat. But the text says I am *already* there? No, the text says \"Head: (7, 2)\".\nIf I am at (7, 2), and there is an 'A' at (7, 2) on the map, that means I am eating an apple *right now* or the map hasn't updated.\nActually, looking at the map again:\nRow 2: `A . A . . T . A . .`\nRow 3: `. . . . . T 0 . . .`\n\nIf I trust the text \"Head: (7, 2)\", then I am currently standing on an Apple 'A' in the map visualization.\n**Hypothesis:** The map is the visual board. The text is the current state.\nIf the text says \"Head: (7, 2)\", and the map shows \"Apple\" at (7, 2), it's likely I just moved there or am about to move.\n**BUT**, the \"YOUR LAST MOVE\" section says I picked **DOWN**.\nIf I was at (7, 3) and picked DOWN, I am now at (7, 2).\nSo the text \"Head: (7, 2)\" is correct and consistent with the move \"DOWN\".\nThe map showing '0' at (7, 3) is either:\n1.  The map is pre-move (showing where I was).\n2.  The map is wrong.\n3.  The text is wrong.\n\nGiven \"Turn: 8\", I am deciding the move for Turn 8.\nThe board state is the state *before* I move.\nSo, if the board state shows '0' at (7, 3), and text says Head (7, 2), there is a conflict.\n**I will proceed assuming the TEXT is the ground truth for my position**, as it explicitly lists coordinates.\n**My position:** Head (7, 2). Body [(7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)].\n**Enemy position:** Head (6, 7). Body [(7, 7), (8, 7)].\n\n**MOVES FROM (7, 2):**\n1.  **UP (7, 3):**\n    *   My body is at (7, 3).\n    *   **DEATH.**\n2.  **DOWN (7, 1):**\n    *   Row 1: `. . A . . A . . .

But the map shows 'T' at (6, 2).\n    *   If the map is accurate, (6, 2) is a Tail.\n    *   Whose tail?\n    *   My body is (7,3), (6,3), (5,3).\n    *   Enemy is at X=6,7,8 (Y=7).\n    *   This 'T' at (6, 2) belongs to me? Or the map is showing something else.\n    *   Let's check Row 2 again: `A . A . . T . A . .`\n    *   Index 5 is `T`. Index 6 is `.`.\n    *   Wait, the map says: `A . A . . T . A . .`\n    *   Indices: 0:A, 1:., 2:A, 3:., 4:., 5:T, 6:., 7:A, 8:., 9:.\n    *   So (6, 2) is empty `.`.\n    *   **Safe.**\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 2):**\n    *   Index 8 is `.`.\n    *   **Safe.**\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI am at (7, 2). I have an apple at (7, 1) below me, and (7, 3) is my own body (so UP is death).\nI have a lead (3 vs 2 apples).\nI want to box in the enemy at (6, 7).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I move further away from the enemy (Y=7). The enemy is at the top.\nIf I go **LEFT** or **RIGHT**, I move horizontally.\nThe enemy is at X=6.\nIf I go **LEFT to (6, 2)**, I move directly below the column (X=6) the enemy is in.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (8, 2)**, I move to the right of the enemy's column.\nThe enemy is at (6, 7).\nI am at (7, 2).\nDistance: X diff 1, Y diff 5.\nTo box him in, I need to cut off his escape.\nHe is in the top-left of the center (roughly).\nI am in the bottom-center.\nIf I go **LEFT**, I am at (6, 2). I am directly below him.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am at (8, 2). I am offset to the right.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am at (7, 1). I am moving to the bottom edge.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe enemy is at (6, 7).\nI want to cut off his path to the right (X > 6).\nIf I move to (6, 2), I am controlling the column X=6 at the bottom.\nIf I move to (8, 2), I am controlling the column X=8 at the bottom.\nThe enemy is at X=6.\nIf I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, I am getting closer to his X coordinate.\nHowever, there is an apple at (7, 1) if I go DOWN.\nWait, let's look at the apples.\nApple at (4, 1), (2, 2), (1, 4).\nApple at (7, 1) is available by going DOWN.\nBut (7, 1) is `.`.\nIs there an apple at (7, 1)?\nRow 1: `. . A . . A . . . A`\nIndex 7 is `.`. No apple there.\nWait, I thought I saw an apple at (7, 2)?\nRow 2: `A . A . . T . A . .`\nIndex 7 is `A`.\nI am at (7, 2). I am sitting on an apple!\nIf I am at (7, 2) and it's an apple, I should have eaten it.\nDid I eat it?\nThe prompt says \"Apples collected: 3\".\nThe apple list has many apples. (7, 2) is not in the apple list provided at the top? Let's check.\n\"APPLE DROPS: (4, 4), (3, 8), (3, 0), (0, 2), (9, 1), (2, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (3, 9), (0, 0), (1, 8), (4, 6), (4, 7)\"\n(7, 2) is NOT in the list.\nBut the Map shows 'A' at (7, 2).\n**Inconsistency:** The text list of apples does not include (7, 2), but the map shows an apple there.\nI must trust the map for the visual board state.\nIf I stay at (7, 2), I eat the apple.\nWait, if I am *already* at (7, 2) (Head: (7, 2)), and the map shows 'A' at (7, 2), then I have *already* eaten this turn? Or am I about to eat?\nIf I am at (7, 2) and it's an apple, I am growing.\nBut I have 3 apples. If I eat one, I have 4.\nThe enemy has 2.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I leave the apple.\nIf I am at (7, 2), I should eat it.\nWait, if I am *currently* at (7, 2) and it's an apple, I have *already* consumed it for this turn's growth or the apple is still there for the *next* turn?\nUsually, in snake logic, if you move onto an apple, you eat it *during* the move.\nIf I am *sitting* on an apple in the board state, it usually means I haven't eaten it yet, or it's a visual artifact.\nHowever, the text says \"Apples collected: 3\".\nIf I eat the apple at (7, 2), I will have 4.\nThis puts me further ahead.\n\n**MOVES:**\n1.  **UP (7, 3):** Into my own body (Body[0] is (7, 3)). **DEATH.**\n2.  **DOWN (7, 1):** Empty space. Safe. Moves me to the bottom edge.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 2):** Empty space (Map shows '.' at index 6, row 2). Safe. Moves me under the enemy (vertical alignment).\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 2):** Empty space. Safe.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to box the enemy in. The enemy is at (6, 7).\nIf I go **LEFT to (6, 2)**, I am at X=6, Y=2.\nThe enemy is at X=6, Y=7.\nI am directly below him.\nIf he goes DOWN, he gets closer to me.\nIf I want to force a collision, I should align myself.\nHowever, I am much smaller than him (length 4 vs 3? No, length 4 vs 3. I have 3 apples + head = 4 segments. He has 2 apples + head = 3 segments).\nIf I have a higher score, I want a head-on collision.\nI am winning 3-2 (or 4-2 if I eat the apple at 7,2).\nWait, if I am *already* at (7, 2), I have likely *already* eaten the apple this turn (turn 8).\nIf I ate it, my score is 4.\nEnemy score is 2.\nI have a size advantage.\nI should be aggressive.\n\nWhere is the enemy going?\nHe is at (6, 7). He is boxed in by walls at X=0 and Y=9?\nX=6 is not near the wall. X=0 is left, X=9 is right.\nY=7 is not near the wall. Y=9 is top.\nThere are apples at (3, 8), (4, 6), (4, 7) nearby.\nHe might go for those.\nI am at (7, 2).\nIf I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, I move to X=6.\nThis puts me on the same vertical column as the enemy.\nThis is a good position to cut him off.\nIf I go **DOWN (7, 1)**, I move to the bottom row. This is safe but isolates me from the enemy.\nIf I go **RIGHT (8, 2)**, I move away from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to (6, 2) to vertically align with the enemy. This positions me to cut off his southern escape or prepare to chase him down. I have the size advantage, so I can afford to get closer.\n\n**CHECKING SAFETY:**\nMy body is (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nIf I move to (6, 2), I am not hitting my body.\nIf I move to (7, 1), safe.\nIf I move to (8, 2), safe.\n\n**CHOICE:**\n**LEFT** seems the most aggressive.\nI am at (7, 2). Enemy at (6, 7).\nDistance is large.\nMoving Left puts me at (6, 2).\nThis is directly South of him.\nIf he moves DOWN, he comes closer.\nIf he moves RIGHT, he moves away.\nI want to minimize his space.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nRow 7: `. . . . . . . 1 T T .`\nThe enemy is at the right side of the map (X=7).\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2), I am moving towards the left side of the map.\nActually, I am at X=7. Enemy at X=7 (or 6).\nIf Enemy is at (7, 7) (Map), and I go LEFT to (6, 2), I am still somewhat aligned.\nIf Enemy is at (6, 7) (Text), and I go LEFT to (6, 2), I am perfectly aligned vertically.\n\nI will assume the Map is slightly wrong and the Text is correct for positions, or vice versa.\nIf I go **LEFT**, I am moving towards X=6.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am moving to Y=1.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am moving to X=8.\n\nLet's look at the available apples.\nApple at (4, 1) is available.\nApple at (2, 2) is available.\nApple at (7, 2) is *under* me (if I am there).\nIf I move LEFT, I leave the apple at (7, 2).\nWait, if I am at (7, 2) and it is an apple, and I move LEFT, I lose the apple.\nI should eat the apple.\nIf I am at (7, 2), and it's an apple, I should stay there?\nBut I have to move.\nIf I move LEFT, I lose the apple.\nIf I move DOWN, I lose the apple.\nIf I move RIGHT, I lose the apple.\nWait, if I am *currently* at (7, 2), the apple is there.\nIf I move *this turn*, I leave the square.\nSo did I eat it or not?\nIn Snake, you eat when you *enter* the square.\nIf I entered (7, 2) last turn (via DOWN), I ate the apple then.\nIf I am *starting* turn 8 at (7, 2), the apple is gone (I ate it last turn).\nBut the map shows 'A' at (7, 2).\nThis implies the apple is *still there*.\nThis implies I have *not* eaten it yet.\nThis implies I am *not* at (7, 2)?\nThere is a massive confusion in the prompt state.\n\n**Resolving the conflict:**\nPrompt says: \"YOUR SNAKE... Head: (7, 2)\".\nMap shows: \"Row 2... (7, 2) is 'A'\".\nIf I am at (7, 2), and it's an apple, I am eating it *now*.\nIf I eat it, I grow. I cannot stay still. I must move.\nSo I must move to a neighbor.\nI should pick a neighbor that is safe.\n(7, 3) is my body. (6, 2) is empty. (8, 2) is empty. (7, 1) is empty.\nI want to eat the apple at (7, 2). But I have to move OFF it.\nSo the apple is eaten *as* I leave?\nNo, usually you eat when you arrive.\nIf the apple is there *now*, and I am there *now*, it's a snapshot.\nI will assume I eat the apple *this turn* regardless of where I go, because I am occupying the apple cell.\nActually, standard Snake rules: You eat when you *enter*.\nIf I entered (7, 2) last turn, I ate it then.\nIf the apple is there in the map, it's a fresh spawn or I am wrong about my position.\n**Hypothesis:** The text \"Head: (7, 2)\" is correct. The map is showing an apple that I am *about* to eat or is bugged.\n**Decision:** I will move to a safe square.\nIf I move **LEFT to (6, 2)**, I am at X=6.\nIf I move **DOWN to (7, 1)**, I am at Y=1.\n\nLet's look at the enemy again.\nEnemy at (6, 7) (Text).\nI am at (7, 2) (Text).\nIf I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, I am at (6, 2).\nThis puts me directly below the enemy (if he is at (6, 7)).\nThis is a strong defensive/offensive position.\nIf he goes DOWN, he meets me (eventually).\nIf I go **DOWN (7, 1)**, I am moving to the bottom edge.\nThe enemy is at the top.\nThis gives him room to breathe.\nI want to pressure him.\n**LEFT** is the pressure move.\n\nWait, is (6, 2) safe?\nMy body is (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\n(6, 2) is not (6, 3). It is (6, 2).\nSo it is safe.\nIs there an enemy body there?\nEnemy body is (7, 7), (8, 7). Safe.\n\nSo, **LEFT** is the move.\n\nBut wait, what about the apple at (7, 2)?\nIf I move LEFT, I don't eat the apple at (7, 2)?\nWait, if I am *at* (7, 2) and it's an apple, and I move LEFT, do I eat it?\nIn standard snake, you eat the apple *on the square you are leaving* if you just arrived?\nOr do you eat it *on the square you are entering*?\nUsually: You move into (7, 2). You eat the apple. You grow.\nIf I am *starting* the turn at (7, 2), I have already eaten the apple from the previous turn.\nIf the apple is still there in the map, it's confusing.\n**Let's assume the apple is there and I can eat it.**\nIf I move LEFT, I leave (7, 2).\nIf I move DOWN, I leave (7, 2).\nIf I move RIGHT, I leave (7, 2).\nNone of these moves keep me on the apple.\nSo I lose the apple regardless?\nUnless I can stay put? No, I must move.\nSo, the apple at (7, 2) is lost if I move.\nWait, looking at the map again.\nRow 2: `A . A . . T . A . .`\n(7, 2) is 'A'.\n(6, 2) is '.'.\n(8, 2) is '.'.\n(7, 1) is '.' (Row 1).\nThere is NO apple at (7, 1).\nSo I cannot gain an apple by going DOWN.\nI can only gain an apple if I go LEFT to (6, 2) or RIGHT to (8, 2)?\nNo, (6, 2) is '.'.\nSo where is the apple?\nThe apple is at (7, 2) and I am standing on it.\nIf I leave it, I lose it.\nThis is tragic.\nBut I must move.\nI must prioritize survival and board control.\n\nIf I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, I am aligning with the enemy.\nIf I go **DOWN (7, 1)**, I am securing the bottom edge.\nIf I go **RIGHT (8, 2)**, I am moving to the right edge.\n\nLet's check the apples list again.\nApples: (4, 4), (3, 8), (3, 0), (0, 2), (9, 1), (2, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (3, 9), (0, 0), (1, 8), (4, 6), (4, 7).\n(7, 2) is NOT in the list.\n**CONCLUSION:** The map is wrong or showing a stale apple.\nI should ignore the apple at (7, 2).\nMy position is (7, 2).\nMy safe moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\nUP is death.\n\nNow, where is the enemy?\nText: (6, 7).\nMap: (7, 7).\nI will assume Text is correct: (6, 7).\nI am at (7, 2).\nDistance: X=1, Y=5.\nI want to close the distance or cut him off.\nIf I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, X distance becomes 0. I am vertically aligned.\nIf I go **RIGHT (8, 2)**, X distance becomes 2.\nIf I go **DOWN (7, 1)**, Y distance becomes 6.\n\n**LEFT** seems the best for cutting off.\nHowever, let's look at the board density.\nI am in the bottom center.\nEnemy is in the top center.\nThere are walls at X=0 and X=9.\nEnemy is at X=6. There is plenty of space to his right (X=7, 8, 9).\nTo box him in, I need to move towards his X coordinate to limit his lateral movement.\nIf I stay at X=7, I block his path to the right.\nIf I go LEFT to X=6, I am on top of his column.\nIf I go LEFT, I might trap him if I can get above him.\nBut I am below him.\nMoving LEFT brings me closer to his X, but I am still below.\nIs there an apple at (6, 1)?\nRow 1: `. . A . . A . . . A`\nIndex 6 is `.`.\nIs there an apple at (5, 1)? Index 5 is `A`.\nIf I go LEFT (6, 2), I am not eating an apple.\nIf I go DOWN (7, 1), I am not eating an apple.\nIf I go RIGHT (8, 2), I am not eating an apple.\n\nSo I am just maneuvering.\nI have 3 apples. Enemy has 2.\nI should play safe but aggressive.\nI should not commit to a suicide run.\nI should not go into a dead end.\n\nLet's look at the long term.\nEnemy is at (6, 7).\nIf I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, I am at (6, 2).\nIf Enemy goes DOWN, he comes to (6, 6), (6, 5)...\nIf I go **DOWN (7, 1)**, I am at the bottom.\nIf Enemy goes RIGHT, he goes to (7, 7), (8, 7).\nMy body is (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nThis body is a wall at Y=3, X=5-7.\nIf I go **DOWN (7, 1)**, I am at Y=1.\nMy body is at Y=3.\nThis leaves a gap at Y=2.\nIf I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, I am at Y=2.\nThis connects me to my body (7, 3) and (6, 3).\nWait, (6, 2) is adjacent to (6, 3).\n(6, 3) is my body.\nIf I am at (6, 2), I am next to my own body. That's fine, as long as I don't run into it next turn.\n\n**Scenario:**\nI go **LEFT (6, 2)**.\nMy head is (6, 2). Body is (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3)... wait.\nIf I am at (7, 2) and I go LEFT, my new head is (6, 2).\nMy old head (7, 2) becomes body.\nMy body list becomes: (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nWait, (6, 3) is already in the body list.\nSo the body will be: (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nThis means I will have two segments at X=6 (Head at 6,2 and Body at 6,3).\nThis is fine.\n\n**Scenario:**\nI go **DOWN (7, 1)**.\nMy head is (7, 1). Body is (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nThis is a vertical line at X=7 (Y=1, 2, 3).\nThis is also fine.\n\n**Scenario:**\nI go **RIGHT (8, 2)**.\nMy head is (8, 2). Body is (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nThis moves me to the right.\n\n**Which move cuts off the enemy best?**\nEnemy is at X=6.\nIf I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, I am at X=6.\nI am blocking the column X=6 at the bottom.\nIf the enemy wants to go down, he has to deal with me eventually.\nHowever, he is at Y=7. I am at Y=2.\nThere is a lot of space between us.\nI cannot \"box him in\" from 5 units away in one turn.\nI need to approach him.\n\nIf I go **LEFT**, I approach him horizontally.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I move away from him vertically.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I move away from him horizontally.\n\nThe best way to dominate the board is to **control the center and limit his expansion**.\nThe enemy is at X=6.\nI am at X=7.\nIf I stay at X=7 or move to X=8, I let him keep X=6.\nIf I move to X=6, I contest his column.\nGiven I have more apples (3 vs 2), I should be willing to engage.\nEngaging means moving closer.\n\n**LEFT** moves me closer to his X coordinate.\n**DOWN** moves me further away.\n**RIGHT** moves me further away.\n\nSo **LEFT** is the engagement move.\n\nIs there any danger?\nMy body is at (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2), I am not hitting my body.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving into an empty space (map says '.').\n\nWhat about the enemy's move?\nHe might move DOWN.\nIf he moves DOWN to (6, 6) and I move LEFT to (6, 2), we are still far apart.\nIf he moves RIGHT to (7, 7), he moves into my column (X=7).\nIf he moves RIGHT, and I stay at X=7 or move to X=6, I might cut him off.\n\nLet's look at the board map again.\nRow 7: `. . . . . . . 1 T T .`\nIf the '1' is at index 7 (x=7), then enemy is at (7, 7).\nIf enemy is at (7, 7), and I am at (7, 2), we are vertically aligned.\nIf I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, I break the vertical alignment.\nIf I go **DOWN (7, 1)**, I increase vertical distance.\nIf I go **RIGHT (8, 2)**, I break vertical alignment.\n\nIf enemy is at (7, 7), and I am at (7, 2), I am directly below him.\nIf I go **LEFT**, I step out from under him.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I go deeper into the corner.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I step out from under him.\n\nI want to control the board.\nIf I am below him, I can trap him against the top wall (Y=9).\nIf I move LEFT or RIGHT, I lose the direct vertical alignment.\n**Keeping vertical alignment** is key to trapping him against the wall.\nIf I stay on X=7, I restrict his movement to X=0-6.\nIf I move to X=6, I restrict him to X=0-5 (and 7-9).\nActually, moving to X=6 helps block his left side? No, he is at X=7 (map) or X=6 (text).\nIf Text is correct (Head 6, 7), he is at X=6.\nIf Map is correct (Head 7, 7), he is at X=7.\n\n**If Map is correct (Head 7, 7):**\nI am at (7, 2).\nIf I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, I move to X=6.\nI am no longer directly below him.\nIf I go **DOWN (7, 1)**, I stay at X=7.\nIf I go **RIGHT (8, 2)**, I move to X=8.\n\nIf I want to trap him against the top wall (Y=9), I need to be below him.\nStaying at X=7 (DOWN or UP - UP is death) is best for vertical pressure.\nDOWN moves me to (7, 1). I am still at X=7.\nThis keeps me aligned.\nIf he moves UP to Y=8 or 9, I can chase him.\nIf he moves LEFT or RIGHT, I am not aligned anymore, but I can move to intercept.\nIf I go DOWN, I am securing the bottom of the column.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving to a different column.\n\n**Let's assume the MAP is the visual truth.**\nEnemy Head at (7, 7).\nI am at (7, 2).\n**DOWN (7, 1)** keeps me in the column.\n**LEFT (6, 2)** moves me to the side.\n**RIGHT (8, 2)** moves me to the side.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (7, 1).\nMy body is (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nI have a gap at (7, 2) and (7, 3)? No, body is (7, 3).\nWait, if I go DOWN from (7, 2) to (7, 1):\nMy new body will be (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nThis is a solid block on the left side of the bottom right quadrant.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2):\nNew body: (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nThis is also good.\n\n**What about the apple at (6, 1)?**\nRow 1: `. . A . . A . . . A`\n(6, 1) is `.`.\n(5, 1) is `A`.\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2), I am adjacent to (5, 1) (Apple).\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 1), I am adjacent to (6, 1) (Empty) and (7, 2) (My tail).\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 2), I am adjacent to (8, 1) (Empty).\n\nIf I go **LEFT**, I get closer to the apple at (5, 1).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I stay at (7, 1).\n\n**Decision:**\nI want to pressure the enemy.\nEnemy is at (7, 7) (Map).\nI am at (7, 2).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I maintain vertical alignment.\nIf I go **LEFT**, I break it.\nMaintaining alignment allows me to react to his vertical moves.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (7, 1).\nIf he goes DOWN, he comes towards me.\nIf he goes LEFT/RIGHT, I can move to match him.\nThis seems like the best way to \"box him in\" or limit his space.\n\nHowever, if I go **LEFT (6, 2)**, I move to X=6.\nThe enemy is at X=7.\nI am not boxing him in, I am moving to the side.\nIf I go **RIGHT (8, 2)**, same thing.\n\nSo **DOWN (7, 1)** is the move to maintain pressure and secure the bottom of the board.\n\nWait, is there any reason NOT to go DOWN?\nMy body is at (7, 3).\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 1), I am safe.\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving towards the apple at (7, 0)?\nRow 0: `A . . A . . . . . .`\n(7, 0) is `.`.\nSo no apple there.\n\nOkay, **DOWN** is safe, keeps me aligned with the enemy, and secures the bottom edge.\nI will go **DOWN**.\n\n**Wait, let's check the \"HEAD-TO-TAIL\" list again.**\n\"Body: [(7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)]\"\nIf I am at (7, 2) and go DOWN to (7, 1):\nNew Head: (7, 1)\nNew Body: (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nThis is a valid snake.\nIf I am at (7, 2) and go LEFT to (6, 2):\nNew Head: (6, 2)\nNew Body: (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nThis is also valid.\n\nWhich one is more aggressive?\nTo box him in, I need to limit his escape.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (7, 1).\nIf he goes DOWN to (7, 6), (7, 5)...\nI am waiting for him at (7, 1).\nIf he goes LEFT to (6, 7), I am at (7, 1).\nIf he goes RIGHT to (8, 7), I am at (7, 1).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2).\nI am at (6, 2).\nIf he goes DOWN to (6, 6), I am at (6, 2).\nIf he goes LEFT to (5, 7), I am at (6, 2).\nIf he goes RIGHT to (7, 7), I am at (6, 2).\n\nGoing **DOWN** keeps me directly below him.\nThis puts psychological pressure and limits his downward movement without exposing my flank.\nIf I go LEFT, I open up the column X=7 for him to move down into.\nIf I go DOWN, I keep the column X=7 blocked by my presence (or rather, I am the blocker).\n\n**Final check:**\nIs there an immediate threat?\nNo.\nDo I have more apples? Yes (3 vs 2).\nShould I be aggressive? Yes.\nGoing DOWN keeps me in the path of the enemy if he descends. This is the definition of aggression without overextending.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Focus on where the enemy is\".\nEnemy is at Y=7. I am at Y=2.\nIf I go DOWN to Y=1, I am moving away from Y=7.\nWait, that's not \"focus on where the enemy is\".\nIf I want to focus on the enemy, I should move towards him.\nUP is death.\nLEFT/RIGHT moves me horizontally, not vertically towards him.\nDOWN moves me vertically *away* from him.\n\n**Contradiction in reasoning:**\n\"Focus on the enemy\" -> Move towards him?\n\"Box him in\" -> Control his space?\nIf he is at Y=7, and I am at Y=2, I can't box him in from below unless I chase him up.\nIf I go DOWN, I am letting him roam free at the top.\nIf I go LEFT/RIGHT, I am moving to the side, not chasing him.\n\n**Wait, look at the board geometry.**\nThe board is 10x10.\nEnemy is at (7, 7) (Top right area).\nI am at (7, 2) (Bottom center).\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (7, 1).\nI am now hugging the bottom wall.\nI have trapped myself in the bottom-right corner (roughly).\nIf the enemy comes down, he traps me.\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (6, 2).\nI am more central.\nI have more options.\nI am closer to the enemy (X-wise).\nI am closer to apples (5, 1).\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\nI should not go DOWN into the corner.\nI should go **LEFT (6, 2)**.\nWhy?\n1.  It moves me towards the enemy's X coordinate (6 vs 7).\n2.  It moves me closer to the apple at (5, 1).\n3.  It keeps me out of the bottom-right corner (X=7, Y=0/1).\n4.  It opens up options to go UP next turn (to Y=3? No, body is there). To go UP to Y=3 is death? No, body is at (7, 3) and (6, 3).\n    If I am at (6, 2), my body is (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3).\n    If I go UP to (6, 3), I hit my body.\n    If I go LEFT to (5, 2), safe.\n    If I go RIGHT to (7, 2), safe (my tail moves).\n    If I go DOWN to (6, 1), safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 1):\nMy body is (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3).\nIf I go UP to (7, 2), I hit my tail (it moves, but usually head-on collision with own body is death). Actually, the tail moves away. But standard snake rules: You die if you move into a square occupied by your body (excluding the tail which moves).\nIf I go UP to (7, 2), and the tail moves from (5, 3) to (6, 3), then (7, 2) is occupied by my body (the old head).\nSo UP is death.\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 1), safe.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 1), safe.\n\nComparing **DOWN (7, 1)** vs **LEFT (6, 2)**:\n**DOWN** traps me in the bottom right corner relative to the enemy.\n**LEFT** moves me to the center-bottom. This is safer and more flexible.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will go **LEFT**.\nWhy?\n1.  Avoids the corner.\n2.  Approaches the enemy's X-coordinate.\n3.  Gets closer to the apple cluster at (4,1), (2,2).\n\nWait, is there any immediate danger in going LEFT?\nMap Row 2: `A . A . . T . A . .`\n(6, 2) is `.`.\nText says Body is (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\n(6, 2) is not in the body.\nSo it is safe.\n\n**LEFT** is the move.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove to (6, 2) to position myself centrally below the enemy. From there, I can intercept his descent or move towards the apple cluster at (4,1) and (2,2). I need to cut off his access to the bottom of the board while maintaining my lead.\n\n**WAIT!**\nI just re-read the \"YOUR LAST MOVE\" section.\nThe AI last turn played **DOWN**.\nThe board state *this* turn shows my head at (7, 2) in the text, and '0' at (7, 3) in the map.\nIf I played DOWN last turn, I am now at (7, 2).\nIf I am at (7, 2), and I play LEFT, I am at (6, 2).\nIf I am at (7, 2), and I play DOWN, I am at (7, 1).\nIf I am at (7, 2), and I play RIGHT, I am at (8, 2).\n\nThe \"BOARD STATE\" shows `0` at (7, 3).\nThis implies I am at (7, 3).\nIf I am at (7, 3), then:\n- UP (7, 4): `.` (Safe)\n- DOWN (7, 2): `A` (Apple, Safe)\n- LEFT (6, 3): `T` (Body, Death)\n- RIGHT (8, 3): `.` (Safe)\n\n**If I am at (7, 3) (Map version):**\nI should go **DOWN to (7, 2)**.\nWhy?\n1.  It eats an apple (Map says 'A' at 7,2).\n2.  It avoids my body at (6, 3).\n3.  It moves me to the bottom.\n4.  It aligns me with the enemy (Vertical).\n\n**If I am at (7, 2) (Text version):**\nI should go **LEFT to (6, 2)**.\nWhy?\n1.  Avoids corner.\n2.  Approaches center.\n3.  Safe.\n\n**Which one is more likely?**\nThe prompt provides a **BOARD STATE (ASCII)**.\nThe prompt provides **TEXT DATA**.\nUsually, the ASCII map is the visual representation of the *current* board.\nIf the map shows '0' at (7, 3), I should trust that.\nThe text might be describing the state *before* the last move?\nNo, it says \"Turn: 8\".\n\"YOUR SNAKE... Head: (7, 2)\".\n\"BOARD STATE... 0 at (7, 3)\".\n\nThis is a critical conflict.\nHowever, look at the \"YOUR LAST MOVE\" section.\nIt says: \"START LAST MOVE PICK DOWN\".\nIf I moved DOWN from (7, 3) to (7, 2), then the text \"Head: (7, 2)\" is correct for the *start* of this turn (Turn 8).\nBut the Board State shows '0' at (7, 3).\nThis suggests the Board State is the state *after* my move? No, that makes no sense.\nIf I moved DOWN to (7, 2), the board should show '0' at (7, 2).\nThe board shows '0' at (7, 3).\nThis means I did NOT move DOWN, or the board is outdated.\nBut the replay says I moved DOWN.\nIf I moved DOWN, I am at (7, 2).\nThe map shows '0' at (7, 3).\nThis is impossible unless the map is one turn behind.\n\n**I must assume the TEXT description of my position is the ground truth for planning.**\n\"Head: (7, 2)\".\nI am at (7, 2).\nI will ignore the map's position of '0' and look at the map's *contents* of the cells around me.\nRow 2: `(7, 2)` is 'A'.\nRow 2: `(6, 2)` is '.'.\nRow 1: `(7, 1)` is '.'.\nRow 3: `(7, 3)` is 'T' (my body).\n\nSo, if I am at (7, 2):\n- UP (7, 3): My body. **DEATH.**\n- DOWN (7, 1): Empty. **Safe.**\n- LEFT (6, 2): Empty. **Safe.**\n- RIGHT (8, 2): Empty. **Safe.**\n\nThis confirms I cannot go UP.\nI must choose between DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nI already decided **LEFT (6, 2)** is best to avoid the corner and approach center.\n\n**Double check:**\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (6, 2).\nIs there an apple there? Map says No.\nIs there a snake there? Map says No.\nText says No.\nIt is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (7, 1).\nIs there an apple there? Map says No.\nIs there a snake there? Map says No.\nIt is safe.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (8, 2).\nIs there an apple there? Map says No.\nIs there a snake there? Map says No.\nIt is safe.\n\nAll three are safe.\nWhich is most aggressive?\n**LEFT** puts me closer to the enemy's X.\n**DOWN** puts me at the bottom edge (bad for mobility).\n**RIGHT** puts me at the right edge (bad for mobility).\n\n**LEFT** wins.\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (6, 2). Secure the center-bottom. Prepare to intercept the enemy or grab the apple at (5, 1). Don't get trapped on the edge.\n\n**MOVE:**\nLEFT\n\nOne final check on the \"Apple at (7, 2)\".\nIf I am standing on an apple, and I move LEFT, do I eat it?\nIn most snake implementations, you eat the apple *on the cell you enter*.\nIf I am *already* on the apple at the start of the turn, I have eaten it in the *previous* turn.\nIf the apple is still there in the map, it's a visual artifact or a new apple.\nRegardless, I must move.\nIf I eat it by staying? No, I must move.\nSo I move.\n\nLEFT\n\nWait, if I am at (7, 2) and it's an apple, and I move LEFT, I leave the apple.\nIf I move DOWN, I leave the apple.\nIf I move RIGHT, I leave the apple.\nI don't gain points by moving.\nBut if I had just eaten it, the apple would disappear.\nThe fact that the map shows 'A' at (7, 2) AND text says I am at (7, 2) is the weird part.\nIf I am at (7, 2), I am blocking the apple.\nIf I leave, the apple stays there (if it wasn't eaten).\nWait, if I am at (7, 2), I am covering the apple.\nIf I move LEFT, the apple at (7, 2) remains?\nThis implies I didn't eat it.\nThis implies I am just standing on it.\nThis is possible in some game versions (apple is hidden under snake).\nIf so, when I leave, the apple is revealed.\nSo I don't eat it.\nThis makes the move purely positional.\n**LEFT** is still the best position.\n\nOne more thing.\nThe enemy is at (6, 7) (Text) or (7, 7) (Map).\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2), and enemy is at (6, 7), I am directly below him.\nThis is a direct confrontation line.\nIf he moves DOWN, he comes closer to me.\nIf I move UP later, I meet him.\nThis is a \"line of battle\".\nThis is good.\nI am forcing him to deal with me.\n\nIf enemy is at (7, 7) (Map), and I go LEFT to (6, 2), I am offset.\nI am not directly below him.\nThis is less direct pressure.\nBut still better than going to the edge.\n\nI'll stick with **LEFT**.\n\n**FINAL CHECK:**\nMoving LEFT from (7, 2) to (6, 2).\nMy body: (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nNew Head: (6, 2).\nNot hitting body.\nNot off board.\nNot hitting enemy.\nSafe.\nStrategic.\nAggressive (moves towards enemy column).\n\n**EXECUTE.**\n\nLEFT",

The map is getting crowded with apples, but the only apple that matters right now is the one I'm about to CRUSH under my feet or avoid like the plague. I need to position myself to cut off the enemy and secure the W.\n\nLet's break down the board state and figure out where I'm standing and where to go.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF THE CONFLICT:**\nThere's a big discrepancy between the text list and the ASCII map.\n- **Text says:** Head (7, 2), Body [(7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)].\n- **Map says:** '0' is at (7, 3), and (7, 2) is an 'A' (Apple).\n\nIf I trust the **Text** (Head at 7, 2), I am standing on an apple.\nIf I trust the **Map** (Head at 7, 3), I am next to an apple.\n**CRITICAL CLUE:** The \"LAST MOVE\" review said I picked **DOWN**.\nIf I was at (7, 3) and went DOWN, I ended up at (7, 2).\nTherefore, the **Text is likely correct**. My Head is at **(7, 2)**.\nThe map showing '0' at (7, 3) might be a visual artifact of the previous turn's state or just a glitch. I will trust the coordinates provided in the list.\n\n**MY CURRENT STATE (HEAD: 7, 2):**\n- **UP (7, 3):** The text says my body is at (7, 3). **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** (Hitting self).\n- **DOWN (7, 1):** Row 1 shows `.` (empty) at index 7. Safe.\n- **LEFT (6, 2):** Row 2 shows `T` at index 5, `.` at index 6. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (8, 2):** Row 2 shows `A` at index 7, `.` at index 8. Safe.\n\n**THE ENEMY:**\n- **Text:** Head (6, 7).\n- **Map:** Shows '1' at (7, 7).\nGiven the pattern of my own text/map discrepancy, I'll prepare for both. However, the visual map is usually the source of truth for the board layout. The Enemy is likely at **(7, 7)** based on the map, but let's look at the board relative to my position (7, 2).\n\n**STRATEGIC GOAL:**\nThe enemy is near the top-left center (X 6-7, Y 7). I am at (7, 2).\nI need to move aggressively to control the board space. I am currently in the bottom-right of the center.\n- **Down** moves me towards the bottom edge (Y=0). This puts me out of the immediate fight with the enemy. Passive.\n- **Right** moves me to (8, 2). This is towards the right wall.\n- **Left** moves me to (6, 2). This moves me **towards the enemy's X-coordinate**.\n\n**THE MOVE: LEFT**\n1.  **Safety:** (6, 2) is empty `.` on the map.\n2.  **Aggression:** Moving to X=6 puts me directly below the column the enemy occupies (X=6 or 7). I am cutting off the lower part of the board.\n3.  **Avoiding the Trap:** If I go DOWN, I'm wasting time. If I go RIGHT, I'm cornering myself on the right wall. LEFT keeps me central.\n4.  **Apple:** There is an apple at (7, 1) just below me, but chasing it immediately might force a bad turn later. Moving LEFT opens up options to go DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT next turn while maintaining central control.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDominate the center column (X=6/7). Force the enemy into the walls or into a head-on collision where my length (score) wins. Use the bottom half of the board as a resource reserve while engaging the enemy in the mid-field.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- Up: DEATH (Self-collision).\n- Down: Safe, but passive. Puts distance between me and the enemy.\n- Right: Safe, but moves towards the edge.\n- **Left:** Safe, moves towards the enemy's zone, maintains central positioning.\n\nI am choosing **LEFT** to cut off the enemy's vertical movement and establish dominance in the central lanes.\n\nLEFT",

My body list starts with (6, 2). If I go RIGHT, I eat my own neck.\n    *   **Verdict:** DEATH \ud83d\udc80. (Backwards into self).\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nI am currently at (5, 2). The opponent is at (4, 6) \u2014 he's close! He's only 2 units away in Y and 1 unit away in X. We are in the center-left of the map.\n*   **Going UP (5, 3):** This moves me toward the opponent. He is at (4, 6). If he moves DOWN or RIGHT, we could have a collision. Since I have fewer apples (3 vs 4), a head-on collision is NOT ideal unless I can guarantee he dies and I live. However, moving UP also puts me closer to the apple at (3, 8) or (3, 9) later. But right now, moving UP towards his face is risky because he might be aggressive.\n*   **Going DOWN (5, 1):** There's an apple at (6, 1) and (4, 1). Moving DOWN (5, 1) is safe, but it's moving me *away* from the opponent. The opponent is above me. If I go down, I'm letting him control the top half of the board without pressure. I need to dominate the space!\n*   **Going LEFT (4, 2):** This moves me directly under the opponent (who is at x=4, y=6). It closes the gap. It also moves me toward the apple at (3, 0) eventually, but more importantly, it cuts off his escape route down the left side. If I go LEFT, I am contesting the column he is in. This is aggressive. If he moves DOWN, he might run into me next turn.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI want to box him in. If I go LEFT, I am at (4, 2). He is at (4, 6). He can't go DOWN past me if I hold that column. \nIf I go UP, I might crash into him this turn or next. \nIf I go DOWN, I lose pressure.\n\n**I choose LEFT.** I want to take the column. I will force him to move away or risk a collision where I might win (if he hits my body, he dies!).\n\n**RANT:**\nChat, watch this! I'm moving in to cut him off! He thinks he's safe at (4, 6)? Nah, I'm taking that space. If he moves down to (4, 5) next turn, he's walking right into my future path. Let's gooooo! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

I took the column, and now I'm staring down Snake #1 at (4, 5). We\u2019re stacked vertically, and I\u2019m about to start boxing him in like a pro!\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 2) (Just arrived!)\n*   **My Body:** [(5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)]\n*   **Opponent Head:** (4, 5)\n*   **Opponent Body:** (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7)\n*   **The Board:** I see apples at (4, 1) below me and (3, 0) nearby, but the priority is **PRESSURE**.\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n1.  **UP (4, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** On board. Not my body (my body starts at x=5). Opponent is at y=5, so not touching him yet.\n    *   **Outcome:** This moves me CLOSER to the opponent. If he moves DOWN to (4, 4) or (4, 3), we collide. Since he has more apples (4 vs 3), a head-on collision is risky. BUT, if I move UP, I gain ground. If I stay back, he moves down.\n    *   **Control:** Moving UP claims the column. I occupy (4, 3).\n2.  **DOWN (4, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** On board. Not my body. Opponent is above.\n    *   **Outcome:** I move away from the enemy. I get closer to the apple at (4, 1) or (6, 1), but I give up the central column pressure.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** On board. Not my body. Opponent is at x=4.\n    *   **Outcome:** This moves me away from the direct confrontation. Safe, but passive. I lose the vertical column advantage.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** My body starts at (5, 2). I would eat my own neck. \ud83d\udc80\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nI am currently size 4 (Head + 3 body segments). Snake #1 is size 5 (Head + 4 body). He has more apples. I need to close the gap and force him into a mistake.\nBy moving **UP** to (4, 3), I am drawing a line in the sand. The gap between us is closing.\n*   **Worst case:** He moves DOWN. If he moves to (4, 4) and I move to (4, 3), we don't collide yet (1 cell gap). If he moves to (4, 3) and I move to (4, 3), it's a head-on collision. With 3 vs 4 apples, if we both die, he wins. **However**, if I move UP and he moves DOWN, he enters the space I just vacated? No, we move simultaneously. If I go UP and he goes DOWN, I land at (4, 3) and he lands at (4, 4). We are adjacent. Next turn, if I go UP again, I force him to move or crash.\n*   **The Play:** I need to assert dominance. If I back off now, he gets the apples. I need to keep him pinned against his own body (which is above him) or the wall.\n\n**RANT:**\nChat, look at this! He's at (4, 5), I'm at (4, 2). It's a showdown in Column 4! If I go DOWN, I'm running. If I go LEFT/RIGHT, I'm flanking. But if I go UP, I'm CHARGING. I'm taking the fight to him! Let's see if he has the guts to meet me in the middle. I'm going UP to cut off his escape!\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We are LIVE and the tension is CRACKLING! Look at this board! It's a battlefield! \n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (4, 3). Body at (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2). I just moved UP from (4, 2). \n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (4, 4). Body at (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7). \n*   **The Threat:** I am one tile directly below the enemy head. He is one tile directly above my head. If I move UP and he moves DOWN, we collide head-on. **CRASH.** \n*   **Score Comparison:** I have 3 apples. He has 5. He is **WINNING**. \n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nIf we go head-on, I lose because he has more apples. I need to survive to outplay him. \n\nLet's look at the moves:\n1.  **UP (4, 4):** \n    *   **RISK:** High. If Enemy moves DOWN to (4, 3), we collide. Since he is winning, I lose the tie-breaker. \n    *   **VISUAL:** I would be stepping into his face. \n2.  **DOWN (4, 2):** \n    *   **RISK:** **DEATH.** That is my *exact* current body segment (the neck). Moving back into your own body is instant death. \n    *   **VERDICT:** Impossible move. \n3.  **LEFT (3, 3):** \n    *   **RISK:** Low. Open space. \n    *   **BENEFIT:** I can flank. I can go for the apple at (3, 0) or (2, 2). \n4.  **RIGHT (5, 3):** \n    *   **RISK:** Low. Open space. \n    *   **BENEFIT:** I can flank. I can go for the apple at (6, 1) or (9, 1). \n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nI cannot beat him in a head-on collision yet. I need to grow. I need to flank. \nThe board is chaotic with apples everywhere. I have plenty of space to my LEFT and RIGHT. \nIf I go **RIGHT**, I open up the path to the bottom-right apples. \nIf I go **LEFT**, I open up the bottom-left. \n\nHowever, looking at the board state, the enemy is boxed in on the top right by his own tail (at 6,7) and the wall. He has limited space up there. I have open space. I need to expand. \n\nLet's look at the apple at (6, 1) - that's a nice juicy one to the RIGHT. Or (3, 0) to the LEFT. \nActually, looking at the enemy at (4, 4), he is \"above\" me. If I go LEFT or RIGHT, I am moving laterally away from the immediate confrontation, buying time to see his next move. \n\nWait! I see a massive opportunity. Look at the board state provided.\nRow 2: `A . A . T T T . . .` (My tail is at 5,2 and 6,2).\nRow 1: `. . A . A . A . . A`\nRow 0: `A . . A . . . . . .`\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (3, 3), I am safer. I avoid the direct vertical clash. \nBut if I move **RIGHT** to (5, 3), I am moving toward the open bottom right. \n\nLet's look at the enemy's potential moves. He is at (4, 4). \n- If he moves DOWN (to 4,3), and I move RIGHT (to 5,3), I survive. \n- If he moves DOWN (to 4,3), and I move LEFT (to 3,3), I survive. \n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI am going **RIGHT**. \nWhy? \n1.  **Safety:** (5, 3) is empty. \n2.  **Expansion:** It moves me away from the enemy's immediate vertical column. \n3.  **Apple Hunt:** It positions me closer to the apple at (6, 1) and opens up the right side of the board. \n4.  **Psychology:** He expects me to be aggressive (UP) or safe (LEFT). Going RIGHT gives me board control. \n\nWait, let's double check the board. \nMy body is at (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). \nIf I go RIGHT to (5,3), I am directly above my own body segment at (5,2). That is NOT backwards, that is perpendicular. That is safe. \n\nLet's check the enemy. He is at (4,4). His body goes to (4,5). \nIf he moves DOWN to (4,3), and I move RIGHT to (5,3), we are diagonally adjacent. No crash. \nIf he moves LEFT to (3,4), no crash. \nIf he moves RIGHT to (5,4), no crash. \n\nI am clear to move **RIGHT**. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSurvive this turn. Flank the enemy. Secure the bottom right apples ((6,1), (9,1)) to increase my score. Once I have equal or higher score, I will force the head-on collision. \n\nLet's GOOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",
