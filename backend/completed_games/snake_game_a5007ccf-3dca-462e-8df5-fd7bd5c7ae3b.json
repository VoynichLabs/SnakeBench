It is the safest move that advances our long-term apple plan.\n\nShort plan for next turns (for next-turn rationale): continue up into row 8, then move left toward (1,8) if uncontested; afterwards pivot to collect remaining apples at (6,8) and (9,8) while avoiding the enemy near x=8.

That creates a potential head-on collision on an apple—if both of you go for it, both die and the game likely ends as a draw. Too risky when a safe alternative exists.\n- LEFT → (7,3): currently empty, but the enemy can move UP from (7,2) to exactly (7,3). That would be a head-on collision. Again, substantial risk with no clear upside over a safer move.\n- UP → (8,4): empty and not reachable by the enemy in one move from (7,2), so there is no possible head-on this turn. You also don’t run into any body segments, and you maintain at least two likely safe options next turn (UP and LEFT), depending on how the enemy moves.\n\nSo UP is the only move that avoids any immediate self-collision and avoids all possible head-on collisions this turn.\n\nStrategy note for coming turns:\n- After moving UP, keep favoring the top and top-left region rather than contesting the very tight bottom-right area around (8,2), (9,1), and (7,0), which the enemy is closer to anyway.\n- If the enemy takes (8,2) and heads further down/right, use your position near the top to swing toward (0,9) and, later, evaluate a path toward (0,0) while keeping safe exits.\n- If the enemy instead moves upward, continue to move UP again next turn (to avoid the forced head-on at (7,4)), then look for a safe path leftward away from their column while maintaining space.\n\nUP",
