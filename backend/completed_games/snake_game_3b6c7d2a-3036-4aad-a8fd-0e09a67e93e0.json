Actually, (5,6) is **1 move down** from (5,2) (since decreasing y is down). So moving **DOWN** would take me to (4,2), but the apple is at (5,6) which is **1 move down** from (5,2) but in the opposite direction (since (5,6) has y=6, which is greater than y=2). Wait, no: (5,6) is **4 moves up** from (5,2) (since 6-2=4). My mistake.\n   - **Correction:** The apple at (5,6) is **4 moves up** from (5,2). So moving **DOWN** to (4,2) is not toward the apple at (5,6).\n   - **Clarification:** The apple at (5,6) is **2 moves right and 4 moves up** from (5,2), so it's not directly reachable in one move.

This is not reachable in one move.\n  - **Correction:** The apple at (2,1) is **not reachable in one move**. The closest apple is (4,1) or (5,2), but both require multiple moves.\n  - **Re-evaluating:** The apple at (1,8) is far away, and the apple at (8,7) is also distant. The apple at (5,2) is the closest reachable apple in the next few turns, but not this turn.\n  - **Alternative:** The apple at (4,1) is reachable in **2 moves (UP, UP)** from (7,1).
