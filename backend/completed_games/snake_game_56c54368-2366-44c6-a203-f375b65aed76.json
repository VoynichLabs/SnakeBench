Both length 1, both 0 apples. Apples around, but remember: focus on the enemy, not the fruit. \ud83d\udc40\n\nDecision walkthrough (thinking out loud for the viewers):\n1) Consider all moves from (9,3):\n   - RIGHT -> (10,3): off-board = instant death. NOPE. \u274c\n   - UP -> (9,4): that cell has an apple, but the opponent at (9,5) can go DOWN into (9,4) this turn. If we both go there it's a head-on and both die (tie). We do NOT want a risky head-on with equal score. Too dangerous. \u26a0\ufe0f\n   - LEFT -> (8,3): safe, plenty of follow-up options (UP/LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT). Keeps mobility. \ud83d\udc4d\n   - DOWN -> (9,2): has an apple and is safe this turn \u2014 opponent can't reach it in one move. Gives us immediate growth and keeps multiple exits (LEFT, DOWN, UP back). Aggressive but safe. \ud83c\udf4e\n\n2) Eliminate immediate-death moves: RIGHT is out. UP is technically not immediate death but is high-risk for a simultaneous head-on given the apple at (9,4) and the opponent above \u2014 avoid that gamble while scores are tied.\n\nWhy I pick the final move:\n- DOWN to (9,2) nets a safe apple this turn, gives us a lead, and increases our ability to force favorable head-on scenarios later (remember: if we have more apples, forcing a head-on is in our favor). It\u2019s aggressive but not reckless \u2014 opponent can\u2019t contest it right now. Also keeps multiple escape/follow-up options so we don't box ourselves in. \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4f\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Secure this apple and use the right edge as a wall to pressure the opponent. Once we\u2019re ahead, bait them into approaching the right side and try to force a head-on when we have the score advantage. Prioritize mobility over chasing distant apples until we can safely trap them.\n\nAlright chat \u2014 let's go claim that apple and build a lead. You know the energy. We move:\n\nDOWN",

No immediate head-on risk (they can\u2019t reach (8,4) in one move).\n\nWhy LEFT:\n- We\u2019re tied 2\u20132 \u2014 being aggressive to control space is the play. Moving LEFT closes the gap and threatens their right flank and escape lanes.\n- LEFT keeps multiple follow-up options (we can go up to pressure from above or down to cut behind), and it leverages our extra length from the recent apple to start boxing them into the top-right quadrant.\n- UP is safe but passive \u2014 I don\u2019t want to give them free space to roam the center.\n\nShort-term plan (to appear as next-turn rationale): Move LEFT to (8,4) to approach and constrict. Next few turns, shadow their head, cut off their exits (especially around x=7\u20138), bait them toward the board edge, and force a mistake or a head-on when we have the advantage. Prioritize controlling their movement over chasing more apples unless a safe, high-value apple drops nearby.\n\nLet\u2019s go pressure them \u2014 time to lock the lane and make a play. LEFT",

Their body = (8,7),(8,6),(7,6). They cannot move DOWN (into their neck). Their legal moves: UP (8,9), LEFT (7,8), RIGHT (9,8).\n- Apples nearby for us: (5,4) is immediately left, (5,3) below-left, (6,2) further down.\n\nEliminate death moves:\n- RIGHT -> (7,4) = into our neck (backwards). Illegal / immediate death. OUT.\n- UP -> (6,5) = empty. SAFE.\n- DOWN -> (6,3) = empty. SAFE.\n- LEFT -> (5,4) = apple. SAFE.\n\nTactical evaluation:\n- UP (6,5): keeps flexible options (L/R/U), but doesn\u2019t score and is a more passive approach toward the enemy\u2019s quadrant.\n- DOWN (6,3): retreats slightly, avoids committing \u2014 safe but slow and doesn\u2019t pressure enemy.\n- LEFT (5,4): immediately grabs an apple, ties the score (would be 3\u20133), increases our length (growing gives us more blocking power), and leaves three clean follow-ups: UP (5,5), DOWN (5,3 \u2014 another apple), LEFT (4,4).

Neck: (7,6) -> LEFT is illegal (would bite our neck). So LEFT = insta-death. \u274c\n\nCheck remaining targets:\n- UP -> (8,7): empty now, not occupied by any snake. Opponent head (5,9) cannot reach (8,7) this turn, so no immediate head-on. From (8,7) we keep lots of options (L/R/U/D) and can pivot to squeeze toward their top corridor. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (9,6): empty, safe this turn. But that hugs the right wall and reduces follow-up options (fewer escape routes). Still safe short-term. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (8,5): empty, safe. More passive and retreats from the fight; keeps options but gives them tempo. \u2705\n\nHead-on risk: We\u2019re trailing 4\u20135, so we must not force a mutual head-on unless we have the advantage \u2014 avoid setups that could allow a double-KO. None of UP/RIGHT/DOWN produce an immediate head-on this turn given opponent head at (5,9). Good.\n\nChoice reasoning:\n- LEFT is illegal.\n- RIGHT pushes to the wall (tightens our mobility), which makes later trapping riskier for us.\n- DOWN is too passive right now; it gives them control of the top and time to grab apples or escape.\n- UP is the sweet spot: it pressures their upper region, keeps multiple safe follow-ups, and positions us to hem them toward the top-left of their cluster if they overcommit. It\u2019s aggressive but not reckless \u2014 perfect while we\u2019re down by one apple.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP to (8,7) now.\n- If they drift left/up into the 6\u20137 x-range, pivot LEFT to (7,7) to start hemming them against the wall.\n- If they try to swing down or avoid, use lateral moves and selective growth to cut escape lanes rather than a blind head-on.\n\nLet\u2019s squeeze \u2014 make him panic.

If they go left along y=9, we can pivot up then left to compress their space. If they sneak down later, we can drop down and outflank.\n- Avoid any move that would share a target cell with their head (we\u2019re behind \u2014 no head-on trades).\n- Stay flexible: keep at least two escape routes each turn while creeping to cut off their top escape.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure, play smart, and box him when he\u2019s cramped.

If opponent drifts left/up into tighter real estate, pivot to seal exits and bait them toward our tail or the board edge.\n- Only trade heads if we have apple advantage or a guaranteed KO \u2014 right now we DO NOT.

Moving into any snake body = DEAD. \u274c\n- Remaining legal moves: UP \u2192 (6,9) and DOWN \u2192 (6,7). Both are currently empty and won\u2019t get us killed this turn.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- DOWN to (6,7): gives follow-ups RIGHT (7,7) and DOWN (6,6). LEFT would be (5,7) but that\u2019s occupied by opponent body (5,7) = death, so only two viable escapes. It keeps us central but doesn\u2019t threaten the opponent\u2019s top cluster effectively.\n- UP to (6,9): you can\u2019t go UP again (offboard) or DOWN (back into neck), so your two follow-ups are LEFT (5,9) and RIGHT (7,9). LEFT (5,9) is currently occupied by opponent body (5,9) so you can\u2019t immediately shove into them, but being at (6,9) hugs the top edge and gives lateral pressure to hem them between the top wall and our body \u2014 perfect for boxing. Also, opponent head at (3,7) cannot reach (6,9) next turn, so no head-on risk now. Important: we\u2019re trailing in apples, so avoid forcing a head-on KO.\n\nDecision logic (short):\n- Avoid illegal/backwards/head-into-body moves. Check.\n- Want multiple follow-ups and pressure toward opponent cluster. UP gives good lateral pressure along the top edge and keeps at least two escape lanes (left/right), while minimizing head-on risk this turn.\n- DOWN is okay but more passive and less useful for boxing their top-heavy body.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP now to cling to the top edge at (6,9).\n- Next turn try to slide LEFT along row 9 (if safe) to compress their space around x=3\u20135; force them to drop south or get boxed.\n- Keep at least two escape options each turn; only force head-on if we flip the apple count or can guarantee they die and we live.\n- If they flee south, pivot down the corridor and cut exits; if they commit into cramped top area, seal them with our body and press apples if safe.\n\nLET\u2019S WRAP HIM \u2014 HYPE, PRESS, SURVIVE. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

UP into the top row gives slightly fewer vertical escape options and makes future lateral trapping trickier.\n- Safety check: RIGHT is safe this turn (no body, no immediate enemy collision). It preserves two reasonable follow-ups and enables aggressive lane control pacing without a dumb head-on.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to (4,8).\n- Next turn evaluate whether to go RIGHT again to (5,8) (gain lateral control) or UP to (4,9) depending on where the opponent moves (if they head right for apples, we push east; if they collapse left/down, we cut them off).\n- Aim to corral them along the 3\u20136 x-range and force them into tighter vertical traps near their own body; only provoke head-on when we can guarantee they run into us or when we have a clear numerical advantage.\n\nRIGHT",

Quick state read and play-by-play so the haters know we\u2019re cooking.\n\nWhere we are:\n- Our head: (4,8). Body in front-to-tail: (3,8),(2,8),(1,8),(1,7),(2,7),(3,7).\n- Opponent head: (2,4) with a long spine down column x=5 and along bottom. They\u2019re up 10\u21926 \u2014 gotta be smart, not dumb. \ud83d\ude24\n\nLegal moves check:\n- LEFT -> (3,8): immediate backwards into our neck = insta-death. \u274c\n- DOWN -> (4,7): legal. Opens interior space but starts turning us back toward our own body cluster.\n- UP -> (4,9): legal. Top-row; safe this turn but limits future vertical push (no UP-after-UP).\n- RIGHT -> (5,8): legal. Keeps east pressure and gives multiple lateral options next turn.\n\nOpponent likely choices:\n- LEFT to (1,4) or DOWN to (2,3) for apples \u2014 they will probably take apples to extend their lead. They cannot move RIGHT (their neck is at 3,4), so no immediate head-on threat toward us this turn. No single-turn collision risk with any of our legal moves.\n\nTactical read:\n- We\u2019re trailing on apples \u2014 don\u2019t force a clueless head-on. We want to box them later, not die trying. The opponent\u2019s body already clogs columns x=5 and x=4 lower down, so pushing east gives us room to sweep and drop down later to cut their lanes. DOWN now pulls us into our own coil and reduces mobility. UP pins us to the top edge quicker (fewer vertical exits). RIGHT keeps momentum, expands our control of the east flank, and preserves options to pivot UP or DOWN next turn depending on how they move. Aggressive, but safe.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep pressuring east to (5,8) now; then evaluate \u2014 if they commit left/down for apples, pivot down and try to hem them toward x\u22482\u20134; if they drift right or try to circle, use the east-side corridor to loop and trap. Avoid head-on unless we can guarantee they run into OUR body or we have a clear apples advantage.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s keep the heat on and not feed them the W. You ready? LET\u2019S MOVE.\n\nRIGHT",
