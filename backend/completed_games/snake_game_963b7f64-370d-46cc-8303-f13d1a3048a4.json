By securing the apple at (2, 7), I'll be in proximity to the apple at (5, 4) and this central positioning provides flexibility to either continue grabbing apples or to evade the enemy if needed. The board layout suggests that control over the center might give strategic advantages.\n\nNext move strategy: After consuming the apple at (2, 7), my aim is to move towards (5, 4) for the next apple. I want to avoid immediate confrontation with Snake #1. Moving towards the center allows me to gauge the situation after potentially capturing two apples, which would keep me ahead in the point race and offer strategic retreat points if necessary.\n\nNext move: UP\n\n**Next turn strategy reminder: After securing the apple at (2, 7) with this UP move, assess the new board state. If feasible, continue towards (5, 4). However, be mindful of enemy movements and adjust strategy accordingly to maintain flexibility and adaptability.
