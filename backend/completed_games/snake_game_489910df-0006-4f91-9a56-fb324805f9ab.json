I've got my eyes on the apple at (3, 8) and the apple at (6, 6).\n\nThe fact that the snake #0 head is at (2,0) is not really an issue for me because going down will take me further away from them to the point that they'll be safely out of my current x - range, allowing me to ignore them for now.\n\nDown seems like a pretty clear move since I'm already primed to move in this direction and I've got no good reason to change what I'm doing yet.\n\nDOWN.",

The snake is 1 unit long.\n2. **Next Moves**:\n    - **UP**: Moving up from (2, 0) to (1, 0) is not possible because it would place the head outside the allowed coordinates.\n    - **DOWN**: Moving down from (2, 0) to (3, 0) would be a valid move and keep the snake on the board.\n    - **LEFT**: Moving left from (2, 0) to (1, 0) is not an option as it would place the head outside the allowed coordinates.\n    - **RIGHT**: Moving right from (2, 0) to (2, 1) would be a valid move and keep the snake on the board.\n\nGiven these options, moving **DOWN** to (3, 0) seems like the best choice. This move will allow the snake to continue exploring the board without running into walls or other hazards. It also avoids the risk of running into the enemy snake (Snake #1) which is currently to our right.\n\n**Strategy Note**: By moving down, we are extending the snake's length slightly and opening up potential paths to the top of the board. This allows us to potentially find more apples and avoid collisions with the enemy snake.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN\nDOWN",
