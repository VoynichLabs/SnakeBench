But I'm near bottom edge \u2014 fewer options.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 1): next turn options: UP to apple (2, 2) unless tail is still at (3, 2) blocking (needs check: if tail follows head after eating, but the current tail segment is at (3, 2). Actually, growth happens after eating apple \u2014 I haven't eaten this turn yet.  \n\nWait \u2014 my body is [(3, 2)], so after my move this turn:  \n    - I only grow if I land on an apple.  \n    - My tail stays at (3, 2) if I don't eat, but if I do eat, tail stays at (3, 2) as new segment added next turn?  \n\nActually correct Snake growth: After eating an apple: the tail doesn't move this turn, but next turn the snake moves forward and leaves the tail in place (so length increases by 1 starting next turn). This means if I eat apple this turn:  \nThis turn: head moves to apple, body segment follows to where head was, tail stays put (so total length increases next turn). Wait, I think I'm mixing rules.  \n\nPer rules: if your head moves onto an apple at the end of this turn, you grow by 1 segment starting *next turn* \u2014 meaning during the next movement, the tail doesn't move; the new segment is added at the tail after movement is completed? Or more standard: after eating, the tail doesn't move for one move, so the length increases by 1 after that move concludes.  \n\nActually simpler: When you eat apple, your tail doesn't advance on the next move. But here: my snake length now is 2. If I eat apple this turn, next turn my length will be 3 effectively after movement: head moves, all segments shift, tail stays where it was before? Wait \u2014 no \u2014 standard: Upon eating apple at end of turn, the snake grows by one segment at the *end* of that turn. Then during the next turn's movement, the tail moves normally, but the extra segment is now part of body. But for me, my tail is at (3, 2) now. If I eat apple this turn at new head position, new segment is added at tail (3, 2), so now body is [old head pos (3, 1) after move, and (3, 2) tail extended], wait but then head is at apple cell. This is getting confusing. Let me simplify to:  \n\nOkay, I think I'm overthinking it. Better to think: if I eat apple at (x,y) this turn, next turn my body will include one more segment at the previous tail position, so the tail won\u2019t advance next turn. So possible self-collision next turn only if I reverse into the new segment.  \n\nAnyway, currently: nearest apple is (2, 2) and (4, 0). Enemy is far at (6, 8).  \n\nLEFT to (2, 1): Next turn possible to go UP to (2, 2) for apple only if (2, 2) is not occupied. Currently it's apple. But will enemy reach it? Enemy at (6, 8) \u2014 maybe in 2 turns could be near, but not immediate threat.  \n\nRIGHT to (4, 1): then next turn DOWN to (4, 0) apple. That\u2019s also good.  \n\nWhich is safer? Going LEFT gets me to left side where wall is close; RIGHT to (4, 1) is more central, more options for future moves.  \n\nBut DOWN to (3, 0) is safe too \u2014 but then I'm on edge and limited.  \n\nI think LEFT or RIGHT are optimal.  \n\nLet\u2019s check future safety: after eating apple at (4, 0) next turn if I go RIGHT now, my body grows and tail at (3, 2) \u2014 not dangerous.  \n\nAfter eating apple at (2, 2) next turn (via LEFT now), also fine.  \n\nBoth okay, but going RIGHT now gives slightly more open space afterward.  \n\nI'll choose **RIGHT** toward (4, 0) apple.  \n\n**Next turn plan:** From (4, 1) next turn, go DOWN to eat (4, 0), then likely move left to area with apples (2, 2) afterward if safe.  \n\nRIGHT",

Since enemy is at bottom edge with limited moves, they\u2019re not an immediate threat to me.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nDOWN gets an apple now, increases my score to 2 (vs enemy\u2019s 2), and keeps future options open. No risk of dying this turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 5) after eating, avoid going UP into own body.

Possible moves: UP (3, 6), DOWN (3, 4), LEFT (2, 5), RIGHT (4, 5).  \nEnemy body at (4, 5) and (5, 5).  \nEnemy cannot move RIGHT into own body.  \n\nFrom (3, 5), enemy might move toward apples or away from walls. Apple at (1, 5) is 2 moves LEFT from enemy. Apple at (2, 2) is closer to me than to enemy. Apple at (3, 2) is just above me.  \n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (3, 4), that's closer to me but still 3 cells away vertically. No immediate collision risk this turn because we are far apart.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility:**  \n- **UP** to (3, 2): eat apple \u2192 grow to length 4 next turn. Next turn from (3, 2): possible moves UP (3, 3), DOWN (3, 1), LEFT (2, 2), RIGHT (4, 2) \u2014 all safe unless enemy moves there.  \n- **LEFT** to (2, 1): no apple. Next turn from (2, 1): UP (2, 2) (apple), DOWN (2, 0), LEFT (1, 1), RIGHT (3, 1) \u2014 good options.  \n- **DOWN** to (3, 0): no apple, near bottom edge. Next turn from (3, 0): only UP (3, 1), LEFT (2, 0), RIGHT (4, 0) \u2014 slightly fewer options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple: (3, 2) directly above me. Eating it increases my length and score.  \nSecond closest: (2, 2) is reachable after moving LEFT then UP.  \n\nUP gets apple immediately and puts me in a good central position.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision next turn:**  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (3, 4) this turn, then next turn enemy could move DOWN again to (3, 3), and I'd be at (3, 2) \u2192 no collision yet.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN twice, we could meet at (3, 2) vs (3, 3) in two turns, but that's later.  \n\nNo clear immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3, 2), consider moving LEFT toward (2, 2) apple next if safe, or UP to (3, 3) to avoid enemy approaching from above. Keep an eye on enemy #0 moving southward.\n\n---\n\n**Best move:** UP to eat apple and grow.\n\nUP",

Eating it grows me to length 5.  \nLEFT to (2, 2) is safe now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- **LEFT** to (2, 2): eat apple. Next turn from (2, 2): possible moves UP (2, 3), DOWN (2, 1), LEFT (1, 2), RIGHT (3, 2) \u2014 but (3, 2) is my current position, will be empty next turn except if enemy moves there? Enemy at (2, 5) cannot reach (3, 2) in one move. Actually enemy at (2, 5) could move DOWN to (2, 4), then next turn to (2, 3) or (3, 4), not directly threatening (3, 2) next turn. So LEFT is good.  \n\n- **UP** to (3, 3): no apple. Next turn from (3, 3): UP (3, 4), DOWN (3, 2), LEFT (2, 3), RIGHT (4, 3) \u2014 all likely safe. But delays apple eating.  \n\n- **RIGHT** to (4, 2): no apple. Next turn from (4, 2): UP (4, 3), DOWN (4, 1) (body? body is at (4, 1) now but will move with me, so next turn body segments shift: head was (3,2), body was [(3,1),(4,1),(5,1)].

Move RIGHT: new head (4,2), new body segments: old head (3,2) becomes new B1, then (3,1) becomes B2, then (4,1) becomes B3. So next turn body: [(3,2),(3,1),(4,1)].  \nSo DOWN from (4,2) goes to (4,1) which is body \u2192 unsafe next turn. So fewer options. RIGHT seems worse for mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy likely moves LEFT to (1, 5) to eat apple. No direct collision risk this turn. Next turn enemy at (1, 5), me possibly at (2, 2) if I go LEFT now. Then distance between heads: (2,2) and (1,5) \u2014 3 units apart, not too risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter eating apple at (2, 2), consider moving toward (2, 0) apple or (1, 5) if enemy leaves it, but be cautious of enemy #0 possibly coming down. Keep central area open.  \n\n---\n\n**Best move:** LEFT to eat apple and grow, while keeping good future mobility.\n\nLEFT",

Wait \u2014 growth mechanics: when you eat an apple, you grow by 1 segment at the end of the turn, so after moving to (1, 5), my body will be [(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)] next turn. Tail at (4, 5).  \n\nFrom (1, 5) next turn:  \nUP (1, 6), DOWN (1, 4), LEFT (0, 5), RIGHT (2, 5) my body \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf I go UP to (2, 6): no apple, body [(2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5)], tail at (4, 5) drops off. From (2, 6) next turn: UP (2, 7), DOWN (2, 5) body, LEFT (1, 6), RIGHT (3, 6) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 4): no apple, body [(2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)], tail at (4, 5) drops off. From (2, 4) next turn: UP (2, 5) body, DOWN (2, 3), LEFT (1, 4), RIGHT (3, 4) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo all three safe moves give me 3 options next turn, but LEFT gives me +1 apple and length advantage.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (3, 2) might go LEFT to (2, 2) to eat that apple, growing to length 5. That would put enemy at (2, 2) next turn, close to me if I go DOWN to (2, 4) or LEFT to (1, 5). But (2, 2) is 1 step away from (1, 5) diagonally, so not an immediate collision risk next turn unless enemy moves to (1, 2) or (2, 3) etc.  \n\nIf I eat apple at (1, 5), enemy might go for (2, 2) then (2, 0) or (2, 9). I should consider moving toward (2, 9) or (8, 8) after eating to avoid being near enemy\u2019s likely path.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT gets me an apple now, increasing my score to 3 (enemy has 3 now, so tie). It also keeps options open next turn. No immediate danger.  \n\nUP or DOWN delay eating, letting enemy possibly get more apples first.  \n\nBest choice: **LEFT** to eat apple (1, 5).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 5), consider moving UP toward (2, 9) or DOWN toward (2, 0) to collect next apple while staying away from enemy\u2019s likely position near (2, 2).

On board.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 7): empty, on board, not my body.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 8): my body segment \u2192 **invalid** (would die).  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 8): empty, on board, not my body.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy possible moves from (4, 1):**  \n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (4, 1):  \n- UP (4, 2): empty  \n- DOWN (4, 0): own body (tail) \u2192 invalid  \n- LEFT (3, 1): empty  \n- RIGHT (5, 1): empty  \n\nSo enemy could go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \n\nWhere could enemy head be next turn?  \n- If UP to (4, 2): far from me.  \n- If LEFT to (3, 1): still far.  \n- If RIGHT to (5, 1): still far.  \n\nNo immediate collision risk with my possible moves this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nFrom my head (3, 8):  \n- UP (3, 9) \u2192 apple.  \n- DOWN (3, 7) \u2192 away from apples.  \n- RIGHT (4, 8) \u2192 closer to (5, 9) and (8, 8) but not immediate.  \n\nEating an apple now would help catch up to enemy\u2019s 5 apples (I have 4).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**If UP to (3, 9) eat apple** \u2192 length 6, body: [(3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)].  \nNext turn from (3, 9):  \n- UP off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (3, 8) \u2192 my body (just added) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (2, 9) \u2192 apple, empty now.  \n- RIGHT (4, 9) \u2192 empty.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT). Could be risky if enemy approaches later, but not immediate.  \n\n**If DOWN to (3, 7)** \u2192 length 5, body: [(3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)].  \nNext turn from (3, 7):  \n- UP (3, 8) \u2192 body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (3, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (2, 7) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (4, 7) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn, but away from apples.  \n\n**If RIGHT to (4, 8)** \u2192 length 5, body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)].  \nNext turn from (4, 8):  \n- UP (4, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN (4, 7) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (3, 8) \u2192 body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (5, 8) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn, and closer to (5, 9) or (8, 8).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision this turn:**  \n\nEnemy at (4, 1) cannot reach any of my possible destinations (3, 9), (3, 7), (4, 8) in one move. So no head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \n\nI\u2019m behind 4 vs 5 apples. Top row has many apples: (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (5, 9).  \nIf I go UP now, I get an apple immediately, but next turn I\u2019ll be on top row with only 2 moves.  \nIf I go RIGHT now, I keep 3 moves next turn and can go UP to (4, 9) (no apple) or DOWN/RIGHT to maneuver toward other apples later.  \n\nBut going RIGHT delays eating, and enemy is ahead. Maybe better to grab apple now to tie score, then be careful next turn.  \n\nCheck if UP is safe beyond immediate:  \nFrom (3, 9) next turn, safe moves LEFT to (2, 9) apple or RIGHT to (4, 9) empty. That\u2019s okay, not completely trapped yet.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nUP gets apple now, ties score 5\u20135, but reduces mobility next turn.  \nRIGHT keeps mobility but stays behind in apples.  \n\nGiven the game is still early (turn 16/150), maybe mobility is better, but apples are critical to not fall further behind.  \nAlso, enemy is far away, so even with reduced mobility next turn, I can likely escape the top row after eating.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP** to tie the score and stay competitive.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (3, 9) next turn, choose LEFT to (2, 9) apple if safe, else RIGHT to (4, 9). After eating two apples in a row, look for a path down from top row to regain mobility. Avoid letting enemy cut off escape.  \n\nUP",

That moves it away from me.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting and space**  \nApples are mostly at top row (y=9).  \nFrom (4, 1):  \n- UP moves toward apples.  \n- LEFT moves toward left side, but apples at (1,9), (2,9), (3,9) are near enemy path.  \n- RIGHT moves toward center/right, apples at (5,9), (8,8) are safer from enemy.  \n\nCheck next-turn safe moves:  \nIf UP to (4, 2): safe moves likely UP(4,3), LEFT(3,2), RIGHT(5,2) \u2014 all empty.  \nIf LEFT to (3, 1): safe moves UP(3,2), LEFT(2,1) body? Wait, body: [(4,0),(3,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)] \u2014 (2,1) is body \u2192 unsafe. So LEFT(3,1) \u2192 next turn: UP(3,2) safe, DOWN(3,0) body, LEFT(2,1) body, RIGHT(4,1) empty but was head? No, head moved. Actually check: after moving LEFT to (3,1), body becomes [(3,1),(4,0),(3,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)]? Wait, no \u2014 length is 6, so new head (3,1), tail removed unless apple eaten. So body: [(3,1),(4,0),(3,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)]? Actually, snake moves: head to (3,1), previous head (4,1) becomes neck, tail (2,2) stays unless apple eaten. But no apple eaten, so tail removed, new body: [(3,1),(4,1),(4,0),(3,0),(2,0),(2,1)]? Let\u2019s track: old body: head (4,1), then (4,0),(3,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2) as tail. Move head to (3,1), so new body: [(3,1),(4,1),(4,0),(3,0),(2,0),(2,1)] \u2014 yes. So next turn from (3,1): UP(3,2) empty, DOWN(3,0) body, LEFT(2,1) body, RIGHT(4,1) body. So only UP safe \u2014 1 option. Bad.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (5, 1): next turn body: [(5,1),(4,1),(4,0),(3,0),(2,0),(2,1)]. From (5,1): UP(5,2) empty, DOWN(5,0) empty, LEFT(4,1) body, RIGHT(6,1) empty \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \n\nSo LEFT leads to dead-end next turn; UP and RIGHT keep options open.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nMove toward top-right apples (5,9) and (8,8) to avoid enemy #0 near top-left. Keep moving upward but favor rightward bias to stay in open space.  \n\n**Strategy note to future self**: You\u2019re moving toward top-right apples. Enemy #0 is top-left after eating (3,9). Keep distance; approach apples from right side. Avoid getting pinned near left wall.  \n\n**Move choice**:  \nRIGHT",

This means (9, 7) will be gone next turn, and (8, 7) is safe from the enemy (they go to 9,7, not 8,7).\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting and mobility**  \nFrom (7, 6):  \n- **UP (7, 7)**: Closer to top-row apples at (5, 9), (2, 9). Next turn from (7, 7): UP(7, 8) is enemy body? Wait check \u2014 enemy body after head (9, 8) is (8, 8), (7, 8) etc. So (7, 8) is enemy body segment \u2192 unsafe next turn. So UP(7, 8) would be blocked next turn; but from (7, 7) other moves: DOWN(7, 6) body, LEFT(6, 7), RIGHT(8, 7) empty \u2014 so actually 2 safe moves next turn.\n- **DOWN (7, 5)**: Moves away from apples but opens central area. From (7, 5): UP(7, 6) body, DOWN(7, 4), LEFT(6, 5), RIGHT(8, 5) body \u2014 so 2 safe moves.  \n- **LEFT (6, 6)**: Central. From (6, 6): UP(6, 7) enemy body? Wait, enemy body includes (6, 7) \u2014 yes unsafe. DOWN(6, 5), LEFT(5, 6), RIGHT(7, 6) body \u2014 so 2 safe moves.\n\nSo all safe moves yield 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Safest path**  \nTop row apples are key \u2014 I\u2019m behind enemy (they\u2019re closer to those). But enemy takes (9,7) first, maybe then (5, 8) or (5,9). I can aim for (5,9) via left side.  \nGoing UP now gets me closer but risks being near enemy\u2014however enemy is going to (9,7), not (8,8), so no head collision risk.  \nGoing LEFT or DOWN keeps me safe but delays apple collection.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Minimize risk of enemy trapping**  \nEnemy could cut me off if I go up too soon, but staying low means surrendering apples.  \nSince enemy goes to apple (9,7), the path to (5,9) via (6,7) etc. next turn is blocked by enemy body. But maybe secure central mobility first: LEFT is best.\n\n**Move choice**: After weighing, heading toward top apples is important but need safety. UP is safe this turn, from (7,7) next turn I can go to (6,7) only if enemy moves away\u2014 but enemy body is at (6,7) so it\u2019s blocked. So UP now yields limited options, LEFT is slightly better for future flexibility.\n\nLEFT",

New body: head (7,7), then (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), tail (6,7) disappears.\n\nFrom (7,7) next turn:\n- UP (7,8): my body \u2192 invalid.\n- DOWN (7,6): enemy body at (7,6) \u2192 invalid.\n- LEFT (6,7): empty (tail just vacated (6,7) this turn) \u2192 safe.\n- RIGHT (8,7): my body \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo next turn only safe move would be LEFT to (6,7). That\u2019s risky but unavoidable now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term planning:**\nFrom (6,7) next-next turn, I could go UP to (6,8) (my body then? Let\u2019s check: after moving to (6,7), body will be [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)] \u2014 so (6,8) is my body then, so UP would be invalid).  \nFrom (6,7) possible moves then:  \n- UP (6,8): body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (6,6): enemy body at (6,6) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (5,7): empty (since tail was at (5,7) two turns ago, now gone) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (7,7): body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo two turns from now, only LEFT to (5,7) again. This is getting tight \u2014 I\u2019m moving along a corridor between my own body above and enemy body below.\n\nBut enemy is at (6,5) now; if enemy moves toward (5,5) or (6,4), they might block my future path.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple access:**\nClosest apple is (5,8) above me. To get it, I\u2019d need to go UP from (6,7) or (5,7), but those cells will be occupied by my body when I get there unless I eat an apple to grow and shift body positions.\n\nActually, if I eat (5,8):  \nFrom (6,7) \u2192 LEFT to (5,7) (no apple) \u2192 then UP to (5,8) eats apple, grows, then my body extends, giving more space behind.\n\nBut enemy might get (5,8) first if they go (6,5)\u2192(5,5)\u2192(5,6)\u2192(5,7)? Wait, they\u2019re shorter, maybe they\u2019ll go for apples too.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of dying soon:**\nOnly one legal move now (LEFT), so I must take it and hope enemy doesn\u2019t cut me off.  \nIf enemy goes to (5,5) this turn, then next turn they could go to (5,6) or (5,4).  \nIf they go to (5,6), that blocks my move from (6,7) to (5,7) next-next turn \u2014 I\u2019d be trapped.\n\nBut they don\u2019t know my only move is LEFT; they might not anticipate blocking me.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. This turn: LEFT to (7,7).  \n2. Next turn: LEFT to (6,7).  \n3. Then LEFT to (5,7) if possible.  \n4. Then UP to (5,8) if apple still there and not blocked by enemy.  \nIf enemy blocks (5,7) before I get there, I\u2019ll be stuck \u2014 but they\u2019d have to move to (5,6) exactly when I\u2019m at (6,7), which is possible if they go (6,5)\u2192(5,5)\u2192(5,6) in two turns.\n\nGiven the forced move, I\u2019ll proceed and hope enemy doesn\u2019t block.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Eating it grows me to length 10, tail at (7, 8) stays for one more turn.  \n\nIf I eat (5, 9), next turn from (5, 9):  \n- UP (5, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (5, 8) \u2192 my body (neck after move).  \n- LEFT (4, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (6, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo after eating (5, 9), I\u2019ll have LEFT or RIGHT as safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision if I go UP to (5, 9):**  \nEnemy at (7, 2) cannot reach (5, 9) in one move \u2014 too far.

But I lose the immediate apple at (5, 9).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term safety:**  \nIf I go UP to (5, 9) and eat apple, I\u2019m at top row y=9. Next turn I must go LEFT or RIGHT to avoid death. Enemy is far away at (7, 2) moving likely toward (7, 0) apple or maybe (1, 9)/(2, 9).  \n\nIf enemy goes toward (1, 9) or (2, 9), they\u2019d need several turns.

Since I need 30 apples to win, taking easy apples when safe is good.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn after UP:**  \nFrom (5, 9), choose LEFT to (4, 9) unless enemy can reach (4, 9) next turn (they can\u2019t from (7, 2) in one move).

So safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).  \n\nSo DOWN gives more options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of trapping myself on top row:**  \nIf I eat (2, 9) now, next turn I can eat (1, 9), then I\u2019m at (1, 9) with only DOWN as safe move (since LEFT off board, RIGHT (2, 9) is my body, UP off board). That\u2019s a potential trap \u2014 only one safe move next turn after eating both apples.  \n\nBetter to eat (2, 9) now, then next turn maybe go DOWN from (2, 9) instead of LEFT to (1, 9) immediately, to avoid being stuck at (1, 9) with only one exit.  \n\nBut if I go DOWN now, I lose immediate apple and enemy could potentially get top row apples later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI have 9 apples, enemy has 5. I can afford to be slightly less greedy if it keeps options open.  \nGoing DOWN now keeps 3 safe moves next turn and avoids being forced into (1, 9) dead-end.  \nFrom (3, 8), I can go to (2, 8) then up to (2, 9) later, or go toward (8, 6).  \n\nBut enemy is far from top apples; they\u2019re not threatened yet.  \n\nActually, eating (2, 9) now is safe and gives me growth. After eating, from (2, 9) I can go DOWN to (2, 8) next turn (keeping options open) instead of eating (1, 9) immediately. That avoids the trap.  \n\nSo:  \nTurn 35: LEFT to (2, 9) eat apple.  \nTurn 36: DOWN to (2, 8) (safe, multiple exits).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT to (2, 9) gets apple, sets up safe DOWN next turn.  \nDOWN now delays apple but gives more immediate options.  \n\nGiven my lead, securing apple while keeping an escape route next turn is fine.  \n\nLEFT  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (2, 9), go DOWN to (2, 8) to avoid being trapped at x=1 later. Then consider path toward (8, 6) or (7, 0) while keeping distance from enemy.  \n\nLEFT",

No immediate collision risk for me at (2, 9) or (2, 8) or (1, 9) because enemy is far.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (1, 9) right next to me.  \nLEFT to (1, 9) eats apple immediately, grows to length 12.  \nDOWN to (2, 8) moves away from top row apples but opens path to (3, 3) or (8, 6).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\n**If LEFT to (1, 9) (eat apple):**  \nNext turn from (1, 9):  \n- UP off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (1, 8) empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 9) empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 9) my body (old head).  \nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s analyze the current state after my last move (DOWN to (2,8)).\n\n**Current board recap:**\n- My head: (2,8), length 11 (10 apples eaten).\n- Apples: (1,9), (7,0), (9,3), (8,6), (3,3).\n- Enemy head: (4,2), length 6 (5 apples eaten).\n- My body: [(2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7)].\n- Enemy body: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2)].\n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safe moves from (2,8):**\n- UP (2,9) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.\n- DOWN (2,7) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT (1,8) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT (3,8) \u2192 empty.\n\nAll three (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe from self-collision and enemy body positions.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves from (4,2):**\nEnemy safe moves: UP (4,3), DOWN (4,1) (its own body? Wait, (4,1) is its body segment 2? Let\u2019s check: enemy body: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2)]. Yes, (4,1) is its body, so DOWN is invalid for enemy. LEFT (3,2) empty, RIGHT (5,2) empty. So enemy can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nEnemy might go UP toward (3,3) apple (2 moves away) or RIGHT toward center.\n\nNo immediate collision risk for me at (2,8) because enemy is far.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**\nClosest apple in Manhattan distance from (2,8):\n- (1,9): dist 2\n- (3,3): dist 6\n- (8,6): dist 10\n- (9,3): dist 12\n- (7,0): dist 13\n\n(1,9) is very close, but eating it means moving to top row, which could limit future moves.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**\n\n**LEFT to (1,8):**\nFrom (1,8): UP (1,9) apple, DOWN (1,7) empty, LEFT (0,8) empty, RIGHT (2,8) my old head (will be body next turn). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. That\u2019s fine. If I go UP to (1,9) next turn, I eat apple but end up at top row corner area with fewer exits.\n\n**DOWN to (2,7):**\nFrom (2,7): UP (2,8) my body, DOWN (2,6) empty, LEFT (1,7) empty, RIGHT (3,7) empty. Safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options). Good flexibility.\n\n**RIGHT to (3,8):**\nFrom (3,8): UP (3,9) my body, DOWN (3,7) empty, LEFT (2,8) my body, RIGHT (4,8) empty. Safe: DOWN, RIGHT (2 options). Less flexible.\n\nSo DOWN and LEFT give more options next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of enemy cutting off paths:**\nEnemy at (4,2) could move toward (3,3) apple. If I go DOWN to (2,7), I\u2019m moving away from that apple, letting enemy possibly get it. But I have a big lead (10 vs 5 apples), so I don\u2019t need to contest risky apples.\n\nBetter to go for (8,6) or (7,0) later, or (1,9) if safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Plan for next few turns:**\nFrom (2,8), going LEFT to (1,8) keeps (1,9) apple reachable next turn while staying off the top row until I decide to eat it. That seems smart: approach apple but don\u2019t eat it immediately, keeping escape routes.\n\nFrom (1,8), I can choose next turn whether to eat (1,9) or go down toward (3,3) or (7,0).\n\nGoing DOWN to (2,7) also fine, but moves me away from (1,9) and top row apples.\n\nGiven my lead, I should avoid risky races with enemy and maintain flexibility.\n\nLEFT to (1,8) gives me options: next turn I can go DOWN to (1,7) toward center, or UP to eat apple, or LEFT to (0,8). That\u2019s good.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final choice:**\nLEFT to (1,8) is safe, keeps multiple options, and positions me to possibly eat (1,9) next turn if I want.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,8), assess if eating (1,9) is safe (check enemy movement). If not, go DOWN to (1,7) to move toward center/other apples. Avoid getting trapped in top row. Keep lead by staying alive.\n\nLEFT",

No immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting and safety after move:**  \n\n**UP to (1,9)**: Eat apple, grow to length 12, but then from (1,9) next turn:  \n- DOWN (1,8) my body (old head position after growth? Wait, after eating apple, my tail stays where it is, so (1,8) will still be my body segment 2 next turn).  \n- LEFT (0,9) empty.  \n- RIGHT (2,9) my body.  \n- UP off board (invalid).  \n\nSo only safe move from (1,9) next turn would be LEFT to (0,9). That\u2019s a dead-end corridor (top row, only left/right, but right blocked by body, up off board, down blocked). That\u2019s very dangerous \u2014 I\u2019d be trapped with only one safe move next turn, and possibly die the turn after.  \n\nThus **UP is risky long-term** \u2014 better to avoid eating (1,9) unless I have an escape route afterward.  \n\n**DOWN to (1,7)**:  \nFrom (1,7): UP (1,8) my body, DOWN (1,6) empty, LEFT (0,7) empty, RIGHT (2,7) empty. Safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options). Good flexibility, moves toward center and other apples.  \n\n**LEFT to (0,8)**:  \nFrom (0,8): UP (0,9) empty, DOWN (0,7) empty, LEFT off board, RIGHT (1,8) my body. Safe: UP, DOWN (2 options). Less flexible than DOWN, but still okay.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI have a big lead (10 vs 5 apples). Priority is staying alive, not racing for risky apples.  \n(1,9) apple is dangerous to take now because it traps me. Better to leave it and maybe loop back later if path clears.  \nEnemy might go for (3,3) apple \u2014 fine, let them have it; they\u2019re shorter.  \n\nFrom (1,7), I can go toward (7,0) or (8,6) or (9,3) later while keeping space.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Final choice:**  \nDOWN to (1,7) keeps most options open and avoids the trap of eating (1,9) prematurely.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,7), consider moving toward (3,3) if enemy hasn\u2019t taken it, or head toward bottom-left apples.

Let\u2019s check: enemy\u2019s shortest path to (0,2) is 5 moves (2,3)\u2192(1,3)\u2192(0,3)\u2192(0,2) or similar.

Next moves from (2,7): UP (2,8) my body, DOWN (2,6) my body, LEFT (1,7) my body, RIGHT (3,7) empty \u2192 only 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT). That\u2019s dangerous \u2014 avoid UP.  \n- **DOWN (2,5)**: from there, UP (2,6) my body, DOWN (2,4) empty, LEFT (1,5) empty, RIGHT (3,5) empty \u2192 3 safe moves next turn. Moves toward (0,2) or (7,0).  \n- **RIGHT (3,6)**: from there, UP (3,7) empty, DOWN (3,5) empty, LEFT (2,6) my body, RIGHT (4,6) empty \u2192 3 safe moves next turn. Moves toward (8,6) and (9,3).\n\nUP is clearly bad (only 1 safe follow-up). So between DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety and competition:**  \nEnemy is at (1,3). If I go DOWN to (2,5), I\u2019m 3 moves from (0,2) via (2,4)\u2192(2,3)\u2192(1,3)\u2192(0,3)\u2192(0,2) \u2014 wait, that\u2019s 4 moves. Actually from (2,5): (2,4)\u2192(2,3)\u2192(1,3)\u2192(0,3)\u2192(0,2) is 4 moves, enemy from (1,3) to (0,2) is 3 moves: (0,3)\u2192(0,2) or (1,2)\u2192(0,2). So enemy gets there first if they go for it. Risk of head-on if I go that way later.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,6), I aim for (8,6) (5 moves) or (9,3) (6 moves). Enemy is far from those. Safer to collect uncontested apples with my lead (10 vs 6).\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose:**  \nDOWN (2,5) \u2192 good options next turn, but risks future competition for (0,2).  \nRIGHT (3,6) \u2192 good options next turn, heads toward less contested apples, avoids enemy path.\n\nGiven my lead, avoiding conflict is wise. RIGHT is better.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,6), consider moving toward (8,6) via RIGHT or DOWN as needed, while keeping an eye on enemy movement toward (0,2). If enemy commits to (0,2), I can safely take right-side apples. If enemy moves UP instead, stay flexible.\n\nRIGHT",

Currently (1, 2) empty. Seems safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 3): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy prediction**  \nEnemy head (2, 6) possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 7): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 5): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 6): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 6): empty.  \n\nEnemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n(1, 6) is enemy body so enemy can't move there. They might go DOWN toward possible eventual lower apple (7,0) or UP toward board middle.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nNearest apple is (0, 2) \u2014 distance Manhattan from (1, 3) = 2.  \nClosest move toward (0, 2): DOWN gets to (1, 2), then next turn LEFT to (0, 2) eats it.  \n\nOther apples: (1, 9) is far (distance 6), (9, 3) far (distance 8), (8, 6) far (distance 9), (7,0) far (distance 9).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Collision risk**  \nEnemy is far away enough (distance 3 in x+y). No risk of head-on this turn: worst case enemy goes DOWN to (2,5) still 3 away from possible my DOWN to (1,2).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Mobility after move**  \nDOWN to (1,2): next turn from (1,2): UP, DOWN, LEFT (to apple), RIGHT possibly blocked by my body at (2,3)? Wait, body in 2 turns: new head (1,2), body = [(1,3),(2,3),(3,3), ...]. At next turn (1,3) still body \u2014 so RIGHT (2,2)? Error: no, (1,2) \u2192 RIGHT is (2,2): empty now, but next turn after eating apple? Let's check:  \n\nActually safer to check:  \nIf DOWN to (1,2): future moves:  \nNext turn: UP to (1,3) \u2014 my body? Yes body segment in (1,3) will be there (since new head at (1,2), and body follows: head at (1,2), 2nd segment at old head (1,3)) \u2192 so UP into body is unsafe unless eating apple at (0,2) first? Wait: Leaving segment at old head position until move done. But after move, tail stays \u2014 but since no apple eaten, tail stays at (5,1) \u2192 body = [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)] length 7? No mistake: current length 6: head, 5 body segments. Moving without apple: segment count same, tail moves forward. Actually, let me check: The snake moves: head to new pos, each segment moves to previous segment\u2019s position, last segment (tail) leaves old position. So after moving to (1,2): body segments: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) \u2014 tail (5,1) gone. Yes length 6 still.  \n\nThen from (1,2):  \nUP to (1,3) \u2014 (1,3) will be occupied by my body next turn because old head (1,3) becomes 2nd segment \u2192 so yes UP is unsafe next turn.  \nLEFT to (0,2): apple \u2192 safe.  \nDOWN to (1,1): safe (empty).  \nRIGHT to (2,2): safe (empty).  \n\nSo DOWN this turn results in only 3 safe moves next turn (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT), not bad.  \n\nLEFT to (0,3) now: next turn from (0,3): UP(0,4), RIGHT(1,3) body?, DOWN(0,2) apple:  \nBody after LEFT: [(0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(4,2),(4,1)] \u2014 tail (5,1) gone.  \nNext turn from (0,3):  \nUP (0,4) empty,  \nDOWN (0,2) apple empty now,  \nRIGHT (1,3) = my body = unsafe,  \nSo safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN only (2 moves). Worse mobility.  \n\nSo DOWN now gives better future mobility (3 options) than LEFT (2 options).  \n\nUP to (1,4) now: next turn from (1,4): from board: empty around except (1,3) my body. So UP(1,5), DOWN(1,3) body! unsafe, LEFT(0,4) empty, RIGHT(2,4) empty. So safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nBest shortest path to apple (0,2) is DOWN now, then LEFT next turn.  \nDOWN also gives equal mobility to UP, but DOWN gets apple next turn, boosting score.  \n\n**Plan for next turns**: After DOWN to (1,2), next turn go LEFT to (0,2) to eat apple, then assess whether to go up left edge toward (1,9) or down to (0,1) to avoid enemy.  \n\nDOWN",

Body: [(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)].  \nNext turn from (0, 2):  \n- UP (0, 3): empty.  \n- DOWN (0, 1): empty.  \n- RIGHT (1, 2): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nDOWN to (1, 1): no apple eaten.  \nNext turn from (1, 1):  \n- UP (1, 2): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (1, 0): empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 1): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 1): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nRIGHT to (2, 2): no apple eaten.  \nNext turn from (2, 2):  \n- UP (2, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (2, 1): empty.  \n- LEFT (1, 2): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (3, 2): empty.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT eats apple immediately and is safe. Even though next turn mobility is only 2 moves, eating apple now is good for score and growth.  \nDOWN gives better mobility (3 moves) but delays apple.  \nGiven enemy has 10 apples already, I need to catch up.  \n\n**Plan for next turns**: After eating apple at (0, 2), next turn go UP to (0, 3) or DOWN to (0, 1) depending on safety. Try to move toward board edges to avoid enemy while targeting next nearest apple (1, 9) via left column.  \n\nLEFT",

Actually, my body is at (4,6) not (5,6). So (5,6) is empty.  \n- DOWN (5,4): empty.  \n- LEFT (4,5): empty (my old head position will be vacated after move).  \n- RIGHT (6,5): apple.  \n\nSo from (5,5), all 4 moves are safe next turn (RIGHT goes to apple, not a body). That\u2019s very flexible.  \n\nFrom (4,4):  \n- UP (4,5): empty (old head vacated).  \n- DOWN (4,3): enemy body at (4,3) \u2192 dangerous.  \n- LEFT (3,4): empty.  \n- RIGHT (5,4): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves, but DOWN is risky if enemy stays there.  \n\nFrom (3,5):  \n- UP (3,6): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (3,4): empty.  \n- LEFT (2,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT (4,5): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves, but blocked upward.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI have a lead (10 vs 7). Enemy is far away at (0,1).  \nRIGHT to (5,5) gets me closer to (6,5) apple and keeps all options open next turn.  \nLEFT or DOWN don\u2019t improve apple access as much.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,5), go RIGHT to (6,5) to eat apple, unless enemy somehow threatens that cell (unlikely given distance). Keep checking enemy movement toward me.  \n\nRIGHT",

Keep avoiding boxing myself in top right corner.  \n\nUP",

They are far from (8,8) for now.  \nIf I go UP now, I\u2019m closer to (8,8) apple next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT is risky because next turn I\u2019ll be at (9,6) with only 2 moves, possibly trapped.  \nDOWN is safe but doesn\u2019t progress toward nearest apple.  \nUP is safe, gives 3 moves next turn, and sets up to eat (8,8) next turn.  \n\nGiven my lead (12 vs 7 apples), I should play safe and maintain mobility while targeting nearest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (8,7), next turn I can go UP to (8,8) to eat apple if enemy not there.

Safety and flexibility first.  \nLEFT to (5, 8) keeps options open, moves toward closest apple, and avoids edges.  \nFrom (5, 8) next turn, I can go LEFT to (4, 8) then UP to (4, 9) then LEFT to (3, 9) then DOWN to (3, 8) to eat apple, or a shorter route if possible.  \nMonitor enemy movement \u2014 they are constrained now, so I can be slightly more aggressive for apples.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",
