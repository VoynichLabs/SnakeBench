The apple at (3, 7) is also close and can be reached in 3 moves by going RIGHT and then UP twice.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, it's currently at (6, 6) and is positioned to potentially go for the apple at (7, 5). It's not an immediate threat to me.\n\nI think my best move is to continue moving UP toward the apple at (2, 8). This keeps my options open - I can either continue straight up to get that apple, or I can pivot RIGHT later to go for the apple at (3, 7) or (3, 9).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP to (2, 6), I'll evaluate whether to continue UP toward (2, 8) or move RIGHT to target (3, 7), depending on the enemy snake's movement.\n\nUP"

Let me evaluate both:\n\nUP (to 3, 9):\n- Captures apple at (3, 9) immediately\n- After capturing, my next moves would likely need to be LEFT to avoid the wall\n- The enemy snake might move UP too, which could create competition in the top area\n\nLEFT (to 2, 8):\n- Captures apple at (2, 8) immediately\n- After capturing, I would have multiple possible directions\n- Sets me up well to potentially head toward the apple at (0, 7) next\n- Puts some distance between me and the enemy snake\n\nBoth moves will score a point immediately, but I think LEFT gives me more flexibility for future moves and better positioning relative to the enemy snake. The apple at (2, 8) also puts me in a better strategic position to access other apples on the board.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT to (2, 8) and capturing that apple, I'll likely continue LEFT toward the apple at (0, 7). I'll need to evaluate the enemy's position to ensure I'm not boxing myself in, but having the western side of the board to myself could be advantageous.\n\nLEFT"
