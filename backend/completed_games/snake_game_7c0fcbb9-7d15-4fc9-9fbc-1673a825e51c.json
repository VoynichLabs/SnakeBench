This seems to be my best option now, uncontested and nearby.\n- (6,9): Slightly further but still quite reachable after securing (6,7).\n- (8,1), (0,1), (1,0): Much farther, not worth considering currently.\n\nImmediate threat and safety evaluation:\n- UP: would move closer vertically to snake #0 (currently occupying (3,8)), becoming dangerous and offering no clear benefit. May result in collision.\n- DOWN: Moves from (3,6) back down to (3,5), which is occupied by my own body. Immediate collision, dangerous, clearly not acceptable.\n- LEFT: Moves to (2,6), safe and empty currently, but seems like a detour away from closest apple (6,7).\n- RIGHT: Moves toward (4,6), safe and strategically beneficial, bringing me closer horizontally to the apple (6,7).\n\nBest decision moving forward:\nThe logical and safest strategic move, with clear benefit, is moving RIGHT toward apple (6,7). I plan to continue RIGHT next turn as well to secure this apple quickly and easily.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nCheck again for snakes and evaluate if still clear; otherwise, keep moving RIGHT or adjust vertically up towards apple at (6,7).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Horizontal movement from row 0 might feel cramped.\n- LEFT feels slightly safer as it leaves additional vertical options open afterward and reduces the risk of approaching the board edge prematurely.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move to continue safely toward the apples at (0,1) and (1,0) appears to be LEFT.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\nAfter moving LEFT, continue focusing on grabbing apples at coordinates (0,1) and (1,0). Keep an eye out for nearby obstacles and be mindful of maneuvering room around the board edges.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

Both squares have apples. However, it's beneficial to consider what comes afterward:\n\n- If moving LEFT (to 0,1), on the next turn:\n  - Possible moves from (0,1):\n    - DOWN (0,0): open and safe.\n    - UP (0,2): open and safe.\n    - LEFT is (\u20131,1), off-board, unsafe.\n    - RIGHT (1,1) turning back would be occupied next turn by new grown body segment, unsafe.\n\n- If moving DOWN (to 1,0), next turn possibilities are:\n  - RIGHT (2,0): open and safe.\n  - LEFT (0,0): open and safe.\n  - DOWN (1,-1): off-board, unsafe.\n  - UP (1,1) turning back would be unsafe due to new body segment occupied.\n\nBoth moves provide good subsequent moves. However, LEFT to (0,1) slightly narrows my available options: limited mostly to vertical options afterward, with fewer open directions. DOWN to (1,0) leaves options more open horizontally as well as vertically, giving slightly more flexibility thereafter. For instance, after DOWN, positions both (2,0) and (0,0) will remain safely accessible.\n\nFurthermore, considering enemy snakes positions:\n- Enemy snake remains well far away (top-right at coordinates around (6,8) and higher). No immediate threat exists near my vicinity.\n\nTherefore, strategically, moving DOWN onto (1,0) allows immediate apple acquisition and slightly better subsequent flexibility, making it the optimal choice this round.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\nAfter taking this apple at (1,0), prioritize carefully evaluating open routes toward the apple at (0,1) and watch carefully for surrounding body segments that may limit my movement.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"

However, it's beneficial to consider what comes afterward:\n\n- If moving LEFT (to 0,1), on the next turn:\n  - Possible moves from (0,1):\n    - DOWN (0,0): open and safe.\n    - UP (0,2): open and safe.\n    - LEFT is (\u20131,1), off-board, unsafe.\n    - RIGHT (1,1) turning back would be occupied next turn by new grown body segment, unsafe.\n\n- If moving DOWN (to 1,0), next turn possibilities are:\n  - RIGHT (2,0): open and safe.\n  - LEFT (0,0): open and safe.\n  - DOWN (1,-1): off-board, unsafe.\n  - UP (1,1) turning back would be unsafe due to new body segment occupied.\n\nBoth moves provide good subsequent moves. However, LEFT to (0,1) slightly narrows my available options: limited mostly to vertical options afterward, with fewer open directions. DOWN to (1,0) leaves options more open horizontally as well as vertically, giving slightly more flexibility thereafter. For instance, after DOWN, positions both (2,0) and (0,0) will remain safely accessible.\n\nFurthermore, considering enemy snakes positions:\n- Enemy snake remains well far away (top-right at coordinates around (6,8) and higher). No immediate threat exists near my vicinity.\n\nTherefore, strategically, moving DOWN onto (1,0) allows immediate apple acquisition and slightly better subsequent flexibility, making it the optimal choice this round.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\nAfter taking this apple at (1,0), prioritize carefully evaluating open routes toward the apple at (0,1) and watch carefully for surrounding body segments that may limit my movement.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"

However, it's beneficial to consider what comes afterward:\n\n- If moving LEFT (to 0,1), on the next turn:\n  - Possible moves from (0,1):\n    - DOWN (0,0): open and safe.\n    - UP (0,2): open and safe.\n    - LEFT is (\u20131,1), off-board, unsafe.\n    - RIGHT (1,1) turning back would be occupied next turn by new grown body segment, unsafe.\n\n- If moving DOWN (to 1,0), next turn possibilities are:\n  - RIGHT (2,0): open and safe.\n  - LEFT (0,0): open and safe.\n  - DOWN (1,-1): off-board, unsafe.\n  - UP (1,1) turning back would be unsafe due to new body segment occupied.\n\nBoth moves provide good subsequent moves. However, LEFT to (0,1) slightly narrows my available options: limited mostly to vertical options afterward, with fewer open directions. DOWN to (1,0) leaves options more open horizontally as well as vertically, giving slightly more flexibility thereafter. For instance, after DOWN, positions both (2,0) and (0,0) will remain safely accessible.\n\nFurthermore, considering enemy snakes positions:\n- Enemy snake remains well far away (top-right at coordinates around (6,8) and higher). No immediate threat exists near my vicinity.\n\nTherefore, strategically, moving DOWN onto (1,0) allows immediate apple acquisition and slightly better subsequent flexibility, making it the optimal choice this round.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\nAfter taking this apple at (1,0), prioritize carefully evaluating open routes toward the apple at (0,1) and watch carefully for surrounding body segments that may limit my movement.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"

This will allow me to grow instantly and gain 1 point.\n- DOWN leads to (1,0), which also contains an apple. This will allow me to grow instantly as well.\n- RIGHT (2,1) is occupied by my own body, unsafe.\n- UP (1,2) is open and safe, but offers no immediate apple benefit and moves away from immediate apples.\n\nAnalyzing strategically between LEFT and DOWN:\nBoth LEFT (0,1) and DOWN (1,0) result in immediate and equivalent benefit. Both squares have apples. However, it's beneficial to consider what comes afterward:\n\n- If moving LEFT (to 0,1), on the next turn:\n  - Possible moves from (0,1):\n    - DOWN (0,0): open and safe.\n    - UP (0,2): open and safe.\n    - LEFT is (\u20131,1), off-board, unsafe.\n    - RIGHT (1,1) turning back would be occupied next turn by new grown body segment, unsafe.\n\n- If moving DOWN (to 1,0), next turn possibilities are:\n  - RIGHT (2,0): open and safe.\n  - LEFT (0,0): open and safe.\n  - DOWN (1,-1): off-board, unsafe.\n  - UP (1,1) turning back would be unsafe due to new body segment occupied.\n\nBoth moves provide good subsequent moves. However, LEFT to (0,1) slightly narrows my available options: limited mostly to vertical options afterward, with fewer open directions. DOWN to (1,0) leaves options more open horizontally as well as vertically, giving slightly more flexibility thereafter. For instance, after DOWN, positions both (2,0) and (0,0) will remain safely accessible.\n\nFurthermore, considering enemy snakes positions:\n- Enemy snake remains well far away (top-right at coordinates around (6,8) and higher). No immediate threat exists near my vicinity.\n\nTherefore, strategically, moving DOWN onto (1,0) allows immediate apple acquisition and slightly better subsequent flexibility, making it the optimal choice this round.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\nAfter taking this apple at (1,0), prioritize carefully evaluating open routes toward the apple at (0,1) and watch carefully for surrounding body segments that may limit my movement.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"

These remain the nearest apples to my current position and would be most efficient to reach.\n- Going LEFT (2,1) moves me horizontally closer quickly toward the apples.\n- Going DOWN (3,0) vertically moves me closer as well. Both movements are efficient and safe, but we should consider what happens after each move to ensure long-term safety.\n\nEvaluating carefully between LEFT or DOWN:\n- If I move LEFT (2,1), next turn I'll have immediate horizontal access toward (1,1) and eventually (0,1), quite easily and naturally\u2014even with freedom of movement.\n- If I move DOWN (3,0), I have a good path as well, but lateral flexibility is slightly more limited afterward. Horizontal movement from row 0 might feel cramped.\n- LEFT feels slightly safer as it leaves additional vertical options open afterward and reduces the risk of approaching the board edge prematurely.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move to continue safely toward the apples at (0,1) and (1,0) appears to be LEFT.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\nAfter moving LEFT, continue focusing on grabbing apples at coordinates (0,1) and (1,0).

Both squares have apples.

However, LEFT to (0,1) slightly narrows my available options: limited mostly to vertical options afterward, with fewer open directions.

This seems to be my best option now, uncontested and nearby.\n- (6,9): Slightly further but still quite reachable after securing (6,7).\n- (8,1), (0,1), (1,0): Much farther, not worth considering currently.\n\nImmediate threat and safety evaluation:\n- UP: would move closer vertically to snake #0 (currently occupying (3,8)), becoming dangerous and offering no clear benefit. May result in collision.\n- DOWN: Moves from (3,6) back down to (3,5), which is occupied by my own body. Immediate collision, dangerous, clearly not acceptable.\n- LEFT: Moves to (2,6), safe and empty currently, but seems like a detour away from closest apple (6,7).\n- RIGHT: Moves toward (4,6), safe and strategically beneficial, bringing me closer horizontally to the apple (6,7).\n\nBest decision moving forward:\nThe logical and safest strategic move, with clear benefit, is moving RIGHT toward apple (6,7). I plan to continue RIGHT next turn as well to secure this apple quickly and easily.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nCheck again for snakes and evaluate if still clear; otherwise, keep moving RIGHT or adjust vertically up towards apple at (6,7).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

However, it's beneficial to consider what comes afterward:\n\n- If moving LEFT (to 0,1), on the next turn:\n  - Possible moves from (0,1):\n    - DOWN (0,0): open and safe.\n    - UP (0,2): open and safe.\n    - LEFT is (\u20131,1), off-board, unsafe.\n    - RIGHT (1,1) turning back would be occupied next turn by new grown body segment, unsafe.\n\n- If moving DOWN (to 1,0), next turn possibilities are:\n  - RIGHT (2,0): open and safe.\n  - LEFT (0,0): open and safe.\n  - DOWN (1,-1): off-board, unsafe.\n  - UP (1,1) turning back would be unsafe due to new body segment occupied.\n\nBoth moves provide good subsequent moves. However, LEFT to (0,1) slightly narrows my available options: limited mostly to vertical options afterward, with fewer open directions. DOWN to (1,0) leaves options more open horizontally as well as vertically, giving slightly more flexibility thereafter. For instance, after DOWN, positions both (2,0) and (0,0) will remain safely accessible.\n\nFurthermore, considering enemy snakes positions:\n- Enemy snake remains well far away (top-right at coordinates around (6,8) and higher). No immediate threat exists near my vicinity.\n\nTherefore, strategically, moving DOWN onto (1,0) allows immediate apple acquisition and slightly better subsequent flexibility, making it the optimal choice this round.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\nAfter taking this apple at (1,0), prioritize carefully evaluating open routes toward the apple at (0,1) and watch carefully for surrounding body segments that may limit my movement.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"
