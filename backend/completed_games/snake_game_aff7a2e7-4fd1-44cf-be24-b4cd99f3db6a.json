UP: (7, 4) - This is an apple! Safe move.\n2. DOWN: (7, 2) - Empty space, safe.\n3. LEFT: (6, 3) - Empty space, safe.\n4. RIGHT: (8, 3) - Empty space, safe.\n\nAll moves are safe (no walls, no body collisions since I have no body yet).\n\nNow let me think about strategy:\n\nThe closest apple to me is at (7, 4), which is directly UP from my current position (7, 3). This is a great opportunity to collect an apple immediately!\n\nLet me check for potential head-on collisions:\n- Enemy head is at (6, 6). If the enemy moves, they could go to (5, 6), (7, 6), (6, 5), or (6, 7).\n- None of these positions would reach (7, 4) this turn, so moving UP is safe from head-on collision.\n\nApple distances from my position (7, 3):\n- (7, 4): Distance 1 (directly above!)\n- (3, 0): Distance 4 + 3 = 7\n- (0, 0): Distance 7 + 3 = 10\n- (5, 9): Distance 2 + 6 = 8\n- (1, 6): Distance 6 + 3 = 9\n\nThe apple at (7, 4) is the closest and I can get it in one move by going UP.\n\nAfter getting that apple, I could consider:\n- (5, 9) - would need to go left and up\n- (3, 0) - would need to go left and down\n- (1, 6) - would need to go left and up\n\nThe enemy at (6, 6) is closer to (1, 6) and (5, 9), so I might want to focus on different apples after grabbing (7, 4).\n\nMy decision: Move UP to collect the apple at (7, 4).\n\nLong-term plan:\nAfter collecting (7, 4), I should consider going for (3, 0) or (0, 0) since they're in the opposite direction from the enemy. The enemy is likely to go for (1, 6) or (5, 9) which are closer to them.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the board state, let me analyze my options:\n\n**Current position:** (7, 3)\n**Possible moves:**\n- UP \u2192 (7, 4) - There's an apple here! Safe move.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 2) - Empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 3) - Empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 3) - Empty, safe.\n\nAll moves are currently safe since I have no body to collide with and all stay within bounds.\n\n**Apple analysis:**\n- (7, 4) is directly above me - 1 move away!\n- (3, 0) is 7 moves away\n- (0, 0) is 10 moves away\n- (5, 9) is 8 moves away\n- (1, 6) is 9 moves away\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nThe enemy snake at (6, 6) is closer to apples at (1, 6) and (5, 9). They're unlikely to compete for the apple at (7, 4) since I can get it immediately.\n\n**Collision check:**\nIf I move UP to (7, 4), the enemy at (6, 6) cannot reach that position in one move (their possible moves are (5,6), (7,6), (6,5), (6,7)). No head-on collision risk.\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\nAfter grabbing (7, 4), I should head toward the bottom apples at (3, 0) or (0, 0) since they're away from the enemy. Let the enemy contest the upper/left apples while I secure the bottom ones.\n\nThe optimal move is clearly UP to immediately collect the apple at (7, 4).\n\nUP",

This turn: Go LEFT to (6, 4)\n2. Next turn: Go LEFT to (5, 4) and collect apple\n3. Then consider going toward (3, 0) or (0, 0) which are away from enemy\n\nThe enemy is closer to (1, 6) and (5, 9), so I should focus on the bottom apples.\n</thinking>\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nCurrent position: (7, 4)\nMy body: [(7, 3)] - tail behind me\n\n**Move options:**\n- UP \u2192 (7, 5): Empty but RISKY - enemy at (7, 6) could move DOWN to (7, 5), causing head-on collision\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 3): DEATH - this is my tail segment\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 4): Safe, moves toward apple at (5, 4)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 4): Safe, but moves away from all apples\n\n**Eliminating dangerous moves:**\n- DOWN is eliminated (moving into my own body)\n- UP is risky due to potential head-on collision\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nThe apple at (5, 4) is only 2 moves away (LEFT, LEFT). This is the closest apple to me!\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy at (7, 6) is closer to apples at (1, 6) and (5, 9). If they move DOWN, we'd collide if I went UP. Better to avoid that risk.\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\n1. Go LEFT this turn to (6, 4)\n2. Next turn go LEFT to (5, 4) to collect apple\n3. After that, head toward (3, 0) or (0, 0) - bottom apples away from enemy competition\n\nLEFT is the clear best move - it's safe, avoids collision risk, and moves directly toward the nearest apple.\n\nLEFT",

This is excellent - I get an apple immediately\n- UP (5, 5): Safe, empty space, moves toward (5, 9) apple eventually\n- DOWN (5, 3): Safe, empty space, moves toward (3, 0) or (0, 0) apples\n\nThe obvious best move is LEFT to collect the apple at (4, 4)!\n\nAfter collecting this apple:\n- My head will be at (4, 4)\n- My body will be at (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4) since I grow\n- I'll have 3 apples\n\nFrom (4, 4), I can plan to go toward:\n- (3, 0) - distance 1+4 = 5\n- (0, 0) - distance 4+4 = 8\n- (1, 6) - distance 3+2 = 5\n- (5, 9) - distance 1+5 = 6\n\nThe enemy at (8, 7) seems positioned to potentially go for (5, 9) or toward the right side of the board.\n\nStrategic plan for next turns:\n1. This turn: Go LEFT to (4, 4) and collect apple (3 apples total)\n2. Next turn: Consider going DOWN toward (3, 0) - I'll be closer to it\n3. The bottom apples (3, 0) and (0, 0) are likely safer from enemy competition\n4. Then go for (0, 0)\n5.

This is clearly the best choice:\n- It's safe (no collision risk)\n- It gets me an immediate apple (my 5th!)\n- Puts me at 5-0 lead over the enemy\n- Great position to continue toward (3, 0) apple\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\n1. After collecting apple at (4, 2), I'll be at (4, 2) with body blocking UP\n2. From (4, 2), continue DOWN to (4, 1), then (4, 0), then LEFT to (3, 0) for another apple\n3. Then sweep to (0, 0) for yet another apple\n4. Watch enemy position - they're at top area, bottom apples are mine\n5. Build up lead before going for contested top apples\n\nDOWN",

A . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . 1 . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . T T T T . .\n 3 . . . . T . . . . .\n 2 . . . . 0 . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . A . . .\n 0 A . . A . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head (0) is at (4, 2). My body (T) is at (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4).\n\nNote: The apple at (4, 2) is gone (I collected it last turn), but (6, 1) is a new apple I see on the list.\n\nLet me consider my possible moves from (4, 2):\n1. UP: (4, 3) - This is my body segment! DEATH\n2. DOWN: (4, 1) - Empty space, safe\n3. LEFT: (3, 2) - Empty space, safe\n4. RIGHT: (5, 2) - Empty space, safe\n\nSo UP is immediately eliminated - I would die by moving into my own body.\n\nLet me check for potential collisions with enemy:\n- Enemy head at (6, 8). Their possible moves are:\n  - UP: (6, 9) - close to apple at (5, 9)\n  - DOWN: (6, 7)\n  - LEFT: (5, 8)\n  - RIGHT: (7, 8)\n\nNone of these moves would put the enemy at (4, 1), (3, 2), or (5, 2), so I don't have any head-on collision risk this turn with any of my safe moves.\n\nAnalysis of safe moves and apple distances:\n- DOWN (4, 1): Distance to (3, 0) = 1+1 = 2, Distance to (6, 1) = 2, Distance to (0, 0) = 4+1 = 5\n- LEFT (3, 2): Distance to (3, 0) = 0+2 = 2, Distance to (0, 0) = 3+2 = 5\n- RIGHT (5, 2): Distance to (6, 1) = 1+1 = 2, Distance to (3, 0) = 2+2 = 4\n\nThe three bottom apples are (3, 0), (0, 0), and (6, 1).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 1):\n- From (4, 1), I can go LEFT to (3, 1), then DOWN to (3, 0) - apple in 2 moves\n- Or from (4, 1), I can go RIGHT to (5, 1), then RIGHT to (6, 1) - apple in 2 moves\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 2):\n- From (3, 2), I can go DOWN to (3, 1), then DOWN to (3, 0) - apple in 2 moves\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 2):\n- From (5, 2), I can go DOWN to (5, 1), then RIGHT to (6, 1) - apple in 2 moves\n\nAll options lead to an apple in 2 moves. Let me think about what keeps more options open:\n\nDOWN to (4, 1) seems best because:\n- It keeps me centrally positioned\n- I can choose between going LEFT toward (3, 0) or RIGHT toward (6, 1)\n- My body segment at (4, 3) won't be blocking me on y=1 level\n\nThe enemy at (6, 8) is likely going for (5, 9). They're far from the bottom apples.\n\nStrategic plan for next turns:\n1. This turn: Go DOWN to (4, 1)\n2. Next turn: Go RIGHT to (5, 1) or LEFT to (3, 1) depending on which apple is safer\n3. Turn 8: Collect apple at (6, 1) or (3, 0)\n4. Then sweep to get remaining bottom apples\n5. Watch for tail positions - my tail should be moving\n\nActually wait - let me reconsider. (6, 1) is an apple and the enemy is at (6, 8). The enemy is far from this apple. \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 2), then DOWN to (5, 1), then RIGHT to (6, 1) - that's 3 moves for an apple.\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 1), then RIGHT to (5, 1), then RIGHT to (6, 1) - that's also 3 moves.\n\nHmm, going DOWN first gives me more flexibility.\n\nActually, let me recalculate:\n- DOWN to (4, 1), RIGHT to (5, 1), RIGHT to (6, 1) - 3 moves to apple at (6, 1)\n- DOWN to (4, 1), LEFT to (3, 1), DOWN to (3, 0) - 3 moves to apple at (3, 0)\n\nEither way, DOWN keeps me flexible and central. I'll go DOWN.\n\nAfter I go DOWN, my body will be:\n- Head: (4, 1)\n- Body: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4) - tail at (7, 4) will disappear since I didn't eat an apple\n\nSo from (4, 1), my safe moves will be:\n- UP: (4, 2) is my body - DEATH\n- DOWN: (4, 0) - safe, leads toward (3, 0) eventually\n- LEFT: (3, 1) - safe, leads toward (3, 0)\n- RIGHT: (5, 1) - safe, leads toward (6, 1)\n\nGood, DOWN gives me 3 safe options next turn!\n\nDOWN is my choice.\n</thinking>\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nCurrent position: (4, 2)\nMy body: [(4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)] - body segment directly above me\n\n**Move options:**\n- UP \u2192 (4, 3): DEATH - this is my body segment!\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 1): Empty, safe\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 2): Empty, safe\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2): Empty, safe\n\n**Eliminating dangerous moves:**\n- UP is eliminated (moving into my own body at (4, 3))\n\n**Collision check with enemy:**\nEnemy at (6, 8). Their possible moves are (6, 9), (6, 7), (5, 8), or (7, 8). None of these intersect with my possible positions. No head-on collision risk.\n\n**Apple assessment:**\n- (6, 1): 2 right, 1 down from current position\n- (3, 0): 1 left, 2 down from current position\n- (0, 0): 4 left, 2 down from current position\n- (1, 6): far, enemy territory\n- (5, 9): far, enemy is closer\n\n**Best move:**\nDOWN to (4, 1) is optimal because:\n- It's safe\n- Keeps me centrally positioned\n- From (4, 1), I can choose to go RIGHT toward (6, 1) or LEFT toward (3, 0)\n- Maintains flexibility with 3 safe follow-up moves\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: Go DOWN to (4, 1)\n2. Next turn: Go RIGHT to (5, 1) toward apple at (6, 1)\n3. Turn 8: Go RIGHT to (6, 1) and collect apple\n4. Then sweep left to collect (3, 0) and (0, 0)\n5.

LEFT: (3, 1) - Empty space, safe\n4. RIGHT: (5, 1) - Empty space, safe\n\nSo UP is immediately eliminated - I would die by moving into my own body.\n\nLet me check for potential collisions with enemy:\n- Enemy head at (6, 7). Their possible moves are:\n  - UP: (6, 8)\n  - DOWN: (6, 6)\n  - LEFT: (5, 7)\n  - RIGHT: (7, 7)\n\nNone of these moves would put the enemy anywhere near my possible moves at (4, 0), (3, 1), or (5, 1), so I don't have any head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nAnalysis of safe moves and apple distances:\n- DOWN (4, 0): I'm adjacent to apple at (3, 0) - 1 step away\n- LEFT (3, 1): I'm 1 step above apple at (3, 0) - can get it next turn with DOWN\n- RIGHT (5, 1): I'm 1 step away from apple at (6, 1) - can get it next turn with RIGHT\n\nAll three moves put me one step away from an apple!\n\nLet me think about strategy:\n- If I go RIGHT to (5, 1), I can then go RIGHT to (6, 1) and eat an apple in 2 turns total\n- If I go LEFT to (3, 1), I can then go DOWN to (3, 0) and eat an apple in 2 turns total\n- If I go DOWN to (4, 0), I can then go LEFT to (3, 0) and eat an apple in 2 turns total\n\nLet me evaluate what happens after each apple:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 1) \u2192 RIGHT to (6, 1) (eat apple):\n- My new head at (6, 1), body would include (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)\n- From (6, 1), my options would be: UP (6, 2), DOWN (6, 0), LEFT (5, 1) - body, RIGHT (7, 1)\n- Good options remaining\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 1) \u2192 DOWN to (3, 0) (eat apple):\n- My new head at (3, 0), body would include (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)\n- From (3, 0), my options would be: UP (3, 1) - body, DOWN - off board, LEFT (2, 0), RIGHT (4, 0)\n- More limited but still OK\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 0) \u2192 LEFT to (3, 0) (eat apple):\n- My new head at (3, 0), body would include (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)\n- From (3, 0), my options would be: UP (3, 1), DOWN - off board, LEFT (2, 0), RIGHT (4, 0) - body\n- Still OK options\n\nHmm, I think RIGHT to (5, 1) is the best option because:\n1. It leads to apple at (6, 1) which is to the right and keeps me away from walls\n2. After eating (6, 1), I have good space to maneuver\n3. The enemy at (6, 7) is far from this apple\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Going RIGHT to (5, 1) means I'm moving toward (6, 1). After eating (6, 1), I can then circle back for (3, 0) and (0, 0).\n\nLet me verify there's no danger:\n- After RIGHT to (5, 1), my body will be: head (5, 1), body (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4) - tail at (6, 4) disappears\n- From (5, 1), safe moves will be: UP (5, 2), DOWN (5, 0), RIGHT (6, 1) - apple!\n- LEFT (4, 1) will be my body - not safe\n\nPerfect! Going RIGHT to (5, 1) sets me up to eat the apple at (6, 1) next turn.\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: Go RIGHT to (5, 1)\n2. Next turn: Go RIGHT to (6, 1) and collect apple\n3. Then sweep left/up to collect (3, 0), (0, 0)\n4.

I'll use moderate reasoning to make a good decision.\n</budget_strategy>\n\n<thinking>\nLet me analyze the current board state:\n\nMy snake (ID 0):\n- Head at (5, 1)\n- Body at (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)\n- I have 5 apples collected\n\nEnemy snake (ID 1):\n- Head at (6, 8)\n- No body segments\n- 0 apples\n\nApples at: (5, 9), (3, 0), (0, 0), (1, 6), (6, 1)\n\nLet me look at the board:\n```\n 9 . . . . . A . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . 1 . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . T T . . . .\n 3 . . . . T . . . . .\n 2 . . . . T . . . . .\n 1 . . . . T 0 A . . .\n 0 A . . A . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head (0) is at (5, 1). My body (T) is at (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4).\n\nFrom my head at (5, 1), my possible moves are:\n1. UP: (5, 2) - Empty space, safe\n2. DOWN: (5, 0) - Empty space, safe\n3. LEFT: (4, 1) - This is my body segment! DEATH\n4. RIGHT: (6, 1) - Apple! Safe and beneficial\n\nSo LEFT is immediately eliminated - I would die by moving into my own body.\n\nLet me check for potential collisions with enemy:\n- Enemy head at (6, 8). Their possible moves are:\n  - UP: (6, 9)\n  - DOWN: (6, 7)\n  - LEFT: (5, 8)\n  - RIGHT: (7, 8)\n\nNone of these moves would put the enemy anywhere near my possible moves at (5, 2), (5, 0), or (6, 1), so I don't have any head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nAnalysis of safe moves and apple distances:\n- UP (5, 2): Empty, far from immediate apples\n- DOWN (5, 0): Empty, but need to go left to reach apples at (3, 0) or (0, 0)\n- RIGHT (6, 1): APPLE! I eat the apple and grow immediately\n\nThis is an easy decision! Going RIGHT to (6, 1) allows me to collect an apple immediately.\n\nLet me verify:\n- After RIGHT to (6, 1), I eat the apple\n- My body will grow, so: head (6, 1), body (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)\n- I'll have 6 apples total\n\nFrom (6, 1), what will my next options be?\n- UP: (6, 2) - Empty, safe\n- DOWN: (6, 0) - Empty, safe\n- LEFT: (5, 1) - My body! Not safe\n- RIGHT: (7, 1) - Empty, safe\n\nGood! I'll have 3 safe options after eating this apple.\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: Go RIGHT to (6, 1) and collect apple (6 total)\n2. Next turn: Consider going UP or DOWN to navigate around my body\n3. Then sweep left toward (3, 0) and (0, 0)\n4. Monitor enemy - they're at (6, 8), likely going for (5, 9)\n\nThe obvious best move is RIGHT to collect the apple at (6, 1).\n</thinking>\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nCurrent position: (5, 1)\nMy body: [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)] - body segment directly to my left\n\n**Move options:**\n- UP \u2192 (5, 2): Safe, empty space\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 0): Safe, empty space\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 1): DEATH - this is my body segment!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 1): Safe, AND there's an apple here!\n\n**Eliminating dangerous moves:**\n- LEFT is eliminated (moving into my own body at (4, 1))\n\n**Collision check with enemy:**\nEnemy at (6, 8). Their possible moves are (6, 9), (6, 7), (5, 8), or (7, 8). None of these intersect with my possible positions. No head-on collision risk.\n\n**Best move:**\nRIGHT to (6, 1) is clearly optimal because:\n- It's safe\n- I immediately collect an apple (from 5 to 6 apples)\n- After eating, I'll have good options: UP to (6, 2), DOWN to (6, 0), or RIGHT to (7, 1)\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: Go RIGHT to (6, 1) - eat apple (6 total)\n2. Next turn: Go DOWN to (6, 0) or UP to (6, 2) to avoid my growing body\n3. Then work back toward apples at (3, 0) and (0, 0)\n4. Enemy likely heading for (5, 9) - let them have it, I'm focused on bottom apples\n\nRIGHT",

My body (T) is at (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4).\n\nFrom my head at (6, 1), my possible moves are:\n1. UP: (6, 2) - Empty space, safe\n2. DOWN: (6, 0) - Empty space, safe\n3. LEFT: (5, 1) - This is my body segment! DEATH\n4. RIGHT: (7, 1) - Empty space, safe\n\nSo LEFT is immediately eliminated - I would die by moving into my own body.\n\nLet me check for potential collisions with enemy:\n- Enemy head at (6, 9). Their possible moves are:\n  - UP: off board (death for them)\n  - DOWN: (6, 8)\n  - LEFT: (5, 9) - Apple!\n  - RIGHT: (7, 9)\n\nNone of these moves would put the enemy anywhere near my possible moves at (6, 2), (6, 0), or (7, 1), so I don't have any head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nAnalysis of safe moves and apple distances:\n- UP (6, 2): Empty, keeps options open. From here I can eventually go around my body.\n- DOWN (6, 0): Empty, gets me to the bottom row near apples at (3, 0) and (0, 0)\n- RIGHT (7, 1): Empty, but moves me further from the bottom-left apples\n\nApple proximity:\n- (3, 0): Manhattan distance from current position (6,1): |6-3| + |1-0| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- (0, 0): Manhattan distance: |6-0| + |1-0| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- (8, 3): Manhattan distance: |6-8| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- (1, 6): Manhattan distance: |6-1| + |1-6| = 5 + 5 = 10\n- (5, 9): Manhattan distance: |6-5| + |1-9| = 1 + 8 = 9 (and enemy is right there)\n\nLet me think about strategy:\n1. DOWN to (6, 0) gets me on the bottom row, from where I can go LEFT toward (3, 0) and (0, 0)\n2. UP to (6, 2) keeps me flexible but doesn't make immediate progress\n3. RIGHT to (7, 1) moves toward (8, 3) but away from the cluster of apples at bottom-left\n\nI think DOWN is the best choice because:\n- It's safe\n- It positions me to go LEFT on the bottom row to collect (3, 0) apple\n- My body will eventually move, freeing up space\n\nAfter DOWN to (6, 0), my next move options will be:\n- UP: (6, 1) - My body will still be there (5, 1) moves to (6, 1)? No wait, the head was at (6, 1), so body moves up: new body would be (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)\n- So from (6, 0): UP (6, 1) - my body! Not safe\n- DOWN: off board\n- LEFT: (5, 0) - empty, safe\n- RIGHT: (7, 0) - empty, safe\n\nHmm, after going DOWN to (6, 0), I can then go LEFT to (5, 0), then LEFT to (4, 0), then LEFT to (3, 0) for an apple!\n\nActually wait, let me reconsider the body movement. When I move DOWN from (6, 1) to (6, 0):\n- New head: (6, 0)\n- Body becomes: (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4) - the tail (5, 4) drops off\n\nSo after moving DOWN, from (6, 0):\n- UP: (6, 1) - My new body segment! NOT safe\n- DOWN: off board\n- LEFT: (5, 0) - safe\n- RIGHT: (7, 0) - safe\n\nGood, I'll have 2 safe options (LEFT and RIGHT) after going DOWN.\n\nActually, let me check RIGHT (7, 1) more carefully:\nFrom (7, 1), next options:\n- UP: (7, 2) - safe\n- DOWN: (7, 0) - safe\n- LEFT: (6, 1) - my body! Not safe\n- RIGHT: (8, 1) - safe\n\nGoing RIGHT to (7, 1) keeps 3 safe options open and moves toward the (8, 3) apple.\n\nLet me compare:\n- DOWN (6, 0): Moves toward (3, 0) apple (distance decreases), leaves 2 safe options\n- UP (6, 2): Stays middle area, keeps options open, 3 safe options after\n- RIGHT (7, 1): Moves toward (8, 3) apple, keeps 3 safe options\n\nI think DOWN is still good to head toward the bottom apples. The (3, 0) apple is relatively close.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. This turn: DOWN to (6, 0)\n2. Next turn: LEFT to (5, 0)\n3. Then: LEFT to (4, 0)\n4. Then: LEFT to (3, 0) - collect apple!\n5. Then continue LEFT to (0, 0) for another apple\n\nLet me verify the path is clear:\n- (6, 0): empty \u2713\n- (5, 0): empty \u2713\n- (4, 0): empty \u2713\n- (3, 0): apple \u2713\n\nI need to track my body as I move. By the time I reach (3, 0) in 4 turns, my tail will have moved significantly.\n\nDecision: DOWN\n</thinking>\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nCurrent position: (6, 1)\nMy body: [(5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)]\n\n**Move options:**\n- UP \u2192 (6, 2): Safe, empty space\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 0): Safe, empty space\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 1): DEATH - this is my body segment!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 1): Safe, empty space\n\n**Eliminating dangerous moves:**\n- LEFT is eliminated (moving into my own body at (5, 1))\n\n**Collision check with enemy:**\nEnemy at (6, 9). Their likely moves are (5, 9) for apple, (6, 8), or (7, 9). None intersect with my possible positions. No risk.\n\n**Apple analysis:**\n- (3, 0): Distance 4, accessible via bottom row\n- (0, 0): Distance 7, same path\n- (8, 3): Distance 4, different direction\n- (1, 6): Distance 10, would need to navigate around body\n- (5, 9): Enemy is right there\n\n**Best move:**\nDOWN to (6, 0) because:\n- It's safe\n- Positions me to sweep LEFT along bottom row\n- Clear path to (3, 0) apple in 3 more moves\n- Can then continue to (0, 0) apple\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: DOWN to (6, 0)\n2. Next: LEFT to (5, 0)\n3. Then: LEFT to (4, 0)\n4. Then: LEFT to (3, 0) - apple #7\n5. Continue to (0, 0) - apple #8\n6. After bottom apples, consider (8, 3) or heading up\n\nDOWN",
