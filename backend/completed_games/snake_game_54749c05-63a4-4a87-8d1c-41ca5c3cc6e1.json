UP: Moving to (7, 9) would take me to the top edge of the board. This keeps me safe but moves away from most apples.\n\n2. DOWN: Moving to (7, 7) would take me closer to the apples at (7, 4) and (7, 3). This seems like a good strategic move as it positions me to potentially reach these nearby apples.\n\n3. LEFT: Moving to (6, 8) would take me away from most apples and doesn't provide a clear advantage.\n\n4. RIGHT: Moving to (8, 8) would bring me closer to the enemy snake at (8, 3), which could be risky as we both grow.\n\nThe DOWN move appears to be the best choice because:\n- It moves me closer to the nearest apples at (7, 4) and (7, 3)\n- It maintains multiple future movement options\n- It keeps a safe distance from the enemy snake\n- It follows a logical path toward collecting apples\n\nI'll choose to move DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

The closest apple is at (7, 3), which is directly below my current position.\n\nEvaluating my options:\n- UP: Moves to (7, 6) - away from the apple\n- DOWN: Moves to (7, 4) - closer to the apple at (7, 3)\n- LEFT: Moves to (6, 5) - away from the apple\n- RIGHT: Moves to (8, 5) - away from the apple and adjacent to enemy snake\n\nAll moves are safe from immediate death. The apple at (7, 3) is the closest and most accessible. Moving DOWN gets me closer to this apple while keeping my options open for future moves. Although there's a slight risk of collision if the enemy snake also moves LEFT to (7, 4), the enemy snake can't move DOWN (into its own body at (8, 3)), making LEFT its most likely move toward the apple. This calculated risk positions me well to potentially eat the apple in the next turn.\n\nDOWN",
