DOWN favors eating an apple soon while maintaining maneuverability post-eat (can go LEFT to (4,1) or RIGHT to (5,armes0 6 \u0686\u06cc\u0632,1) after). UP or RIGHT defer progress and might scatter toward distant apples ((3,8),(0,6),(0,4)) later.\n\nLong-term: After eating (5,1), prioritize left toward (0,4) or center-right experimenting toward (9,5)/(3,8), watching enemy (who has length advantage but slow growth). Stay mid-board to avoid edges, eat efficiently to surpass enemy's 2 apples. Avoid tight spaces like bottom-left where enemy lurks.\n\nDOWN",

Horizontal body blocks rightward movement and reversal (RIGHT is forbidden and into own body).\n- **Safe Moves**:\n  - UP to (3,4): Free space, no self-collision, no enemy body overlap, not reversing. Opens paths toward mid-board y-levels.\n  - DOWN to (3,2): Free, but leads to lower y-level with fewer immediate apples (risks dead-end at bottom, apples at y=1,4,5,8 prefer mid/high).\n  - LEFT to (2,3): Free, but shifts farther left (x=2) away from right-leaning apples like (6,4), (9,4), (9,5); could access (9,1) later but circuitous.\n  - RIGHT: Unsafe (directly into own body at (4,3), reversal).\n- **Apples and Opportunities**:\n  - Nearby: (6,4) \u2013 reachable via UP then RIGHT/RIGHT to (4,4)-(5,4)-(6,4) in ~3 moves if I move efficiently.\n  - Further: x=9 cluster (9,4), (9,5) via prolonged RIGHTward path from y=3-4; (9,8) higher; (9,1) lower.\n  - Eating potential: None immediately; (6,4) is attractive for fast +1 (score to 6) without deep forays.\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Head (6,8), body L-shaped north (x=2-6 at y=8-9). Likely targeting top/right apples ((9,8), (9,5), etc.). They have 6 apples (tied if we die/draw rules apply, but aim to win). Avoid head-on or body overlap; their possible down moves (e.g., DOWN to (6,7)) could threaten y=7+ if I linger.\n- **Board Risks/Traps**: Low y (DOWN) risks bottom edge/bottlenecks; LEFT disperses but delays apple access. UP to y=4 keeps ~4x options, avoids low traps, gains height for evasion/clustering (apples @ y=4-8).\n- **Strategy**: Prioritize UP for northward momentum, +1 apple pursuit (e.g., (6,4) then x=9 cluster), space maintenance (mid-y flexible), enemy separation (they're north, UP opens gap). Avoid stagnation; rapid eating key (their lead).\n\n### New Short-Term Plan for Next 1-2 Turns\nFrom (3,4) after UP, assess (6,4) accessibility: if clear UP to (3,5) or RIGHT to (4,4)-(5,4), prioritize RIGHTward chain to (6,4) for eat (+1, length to 8, score to 6). If enemy encroaches south (e.g., via (6,7)), zigzag RIGHT/UP to evade and loop toward x=9 cluster ((9,4)/(9,5)). Keep >4 safe move options; don't commit to low y or direct enemy overlap near x=6.\n\nUP",

Other apples ((9,4),(9,5),(9,8),(9,1)) require detours/flanking post-eat\u2014RIGHT keeps momentum toward right cluster. Eating now is critical to catch enemy before right-side area gets contested (enemy heads toward x=8-9).\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Head (8,8), likely moving RIGHT to (9,8) apple or UP/DOWN for exploration; no immediate collision risk this turn (heads far apart, no shared-space danger). Their rightward lean could crowd (6,4) area or block paths, so seizing apple quickly maintains advantage/growth. Avoid mirroring if they go UP, as it widens y-gap.\n- **Board Risks**: RIGHT limits follow-ups early but unlocks +1/eat quickly with no self-trap; path to y=4 corridor remains clear post-eat. UP disperses options without rewards but avoids early commitment\u2014trade-off is speed of eating. No head-on risks predicted. Board edges/lateral body avoidable.\n- **Strategy**: Continue last plan's RIGHTward apple pursuit to eat (6,4) for visual +1 (to 6 apples), gaining length/space; post-eat (from (6,4)), prioritize RIGHT to (7,4) then branch to (9,4)/(9,5) for evasion/options.

RIGHT moves onto apple at (6,4) for guaranteed eat and growth (from 6 to 7 segments), increasing apples from 5 to 6, and closing the gap with enemy Snake #1 who has 7.\n- **Safe Moves**:\n  - RIGHT to (6,4): Safe, eats apple (+1 apple, +1 length); post-move head at (6,4), body remains intact and grown. 3 follow-up options: UP (6,5), RIGHT (7,4), DOWN (6,3). Opens direct path RIGHT to (7,4)-(8,4)-(9,4) apple chain, or DOWN to (8,3) apple; keeps mid-board flexibility while prioritizing eating. Board right-side is open, with enemy body distant (y=8-9, x=4-9), no imminent crowding for this move.\n  - UP to (5,5): Safe, no eat; 3 follow-up options: UP (5,6), LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5). Spreads options across y=5-6, avoiding rightward commitment early, but delays eating and doesn't reduce enemy lead. Less aggressive toward apples.\n- **Apples and Opportunities**: RIGHT guarantees +1 in 1 turn, advancing toward cluster ((9,4),(9,5),(8,3)). UP doesn't eat this turn, allowing enemy to potentially eat first (though no obvious apple near their head at (9,8)). Eating RIGHT sets up future eats without over-committing in a dead-end.\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Head (9,8), body curving from x=9 y=8 down/left to x=4 y=9. Likely safe moves: LEFT to (8,8), UP (9,9), DOWN (9,7). No apple at adjacent cells; probable LEFT/UP exploration or toward distant apples like (9,4)-(9,5). RISK: Possible head-on if enemy somehow moves LEFT multiple steps (e.g., to x=5-6 y=8), but unlikely this turn\u2014heads are far (4 units apart). If they go UP/DOWN, no collision; RIGHT isn't possible (off-board). If I go RIGHT, their movement this turn won't overlap.\n- **Board Risks**: No off-board, no self-body hits, no enemy body contact this turn. RIGHT commits somewhat right but unlocks growth/apples without self-trap; body tail at (5,3) and enemy at high y keeps lower board open. Long-term: Enemy right-side presence (body in x=4-8 y=8-9) might force leftward escapes later, so growing quickly mitigates.\n- **Strategy**: Eat with RIGHT to score and grow, then pursue RIGHTward apples ((9,4)/(9,5) via (7,4)-(8,4), or detour DOWN to (8,3)). This mirrors prior plan's apple hunting while separating vertically. If enemy descends post-this, pivot to UP/LEFT for space.\n\n### Short-Term Plan (1-3 Turns Ahead)\nMove RIGHT to (6,4) for eat (+1 apple to 6, +1 length); then RIGHT to (7,4) > RIGHT to (8,4); then DOWN to (8,3) for another eat, or RIGHT to (9,4). This builds length/distance from enemy, targeting right apples; monitor enemy if they shift south\u2014then abort right moves for UP/LEFT to y=6+.\n\nRIGHT",

Opens routes without crowding; my body/tail allows left-ish escapes; enemy body high right (y=8-9) distant, no near blocks.\n  - DOWN to (6,3): Safe, no eat this turn, 3 follow-ups ((5,3) is own tail, invalid; but UP (6,4), RIGHT (7,3), LEFT (5,3) invalid); positions toward (8,3) apple (RIGHT then RIGHT to (8,3) in 2 moves) or (7,0). Keeps vertical flexibility but weaker on rightward apple cluster; board lower-left open, less direct competition risk.\n  - UP to (6,5): Safe, no eat this turn, 3 follow-ups (UP (6,6), RIGHT (7,5), LEFT (5,5)); maximizes mid-board mobility (y=5-6 open), indirect path to (9,5) via Rights and UPs (longer), avoids right commitment but no aggressive eat setup; enemy tail/body at y=8-9 may force pivots later.\n- **Apples and Opportunities**: RIGHT best for guaranteed future eats ((9,4) in 2 turns), DOWN in 3 turns ((8,3)). UP delays eats, risking enemySnake#1 (7 apples) to extend lead by eating (9,4) or (9,5) first (though their head at (9,7), path ~3-4 turns away). Score parity critical (I have 6, they 7); growing/lengthening via eats creates escape buffer. (9,1) and (7,0) distant, lower priority.\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Head (9,7), curved body x=4-9 y=8-9. Likely safe: LEFT to (8,7) or DOWN to (9,6) (UP into own (9,8) dies). No near apple for them; probable LEFT exploration or south. RISK: Minimal head-on this turn (me at (6,4), them ~3-4 units away); if they LEFT twice next turn to ~x=7 y=7, watch for collisions. RIGHT path skirts their high-right body; if RIGHT to (7,4), follow-ups avoid y=8-9. If DOWN, my RIGHT still safe.\n- **Board Risks**: All moves avoid off-board, self-body, enemy body. Long-term right commitment vs. RIGHT could trap if enemy descends/highlights top (their body there), but board's open lower/mid (y=0-7 mostly clear) allows escapes via LEFT/DOWN if needed. Growing mitigates.\n\n### Short-Term Plan (1-3 Turns Ahead)\nMove RIGHT to (7,4) for eat setups; then RIGHT to (8,4) > RIGHT to (9,4) to eat at (9,4) (+1 apple to 7, 8 segments); then decide from (9,4): UP to (9,5) apple or DOWN to (9,3) for space.

UP invalid (directly into own body at (7,4)).\n- **Safe Moves Evaluation**:\n  - RIGHT to (8,3): Eats apple, gains 1 apple to 7. Opens good mid-board mobility (y=2-4 relatively open), direct follow-up to adjacent open spaces; sets up pivots toward (2,2) via LEFT/DOWN or upper board via RIGHT/UP. No enemy collision risk this turn (enemy head at (9,5)). Closes apple gap (enemy likely eats (9,4) to 9, so down 2); keeps options open without funnelling toward enemy.\n  - DOWN to (7,2): No eat; moves to lower board (y=2 open), near (2,2) apple (could setup via RIGHT to (8,2) then LEFT/DOWN to reach). More constrained in terms of immediate upward mobility (y increases harder from here). Lower enemy risk (enemy unlikely to descend soon), but delays eating\u2014enemy eats (9,4), up to 9 while I remain 6.\n  - LEFT to (6,3): No eat; mid-board detour, potential indirect path to (2,2) via LEFT/DOWN/LEFT or back-track options. Good for mid-field freedom, avoiding upper enemy cluster, but no apple setup and enemy could pivot left after their potential eat, crowding this area.\n- **Apples and Opportunities**: Enemy (8 apples) has clear path to (9,4) via DOWN, likely gaining to 9. RIGHT eats (8,3), mitigates gap (to 7 vs. 9). Other apples: (9,1) and (7,0) need longer sets, (2,2) reachable via LEFT/DOWN path. Skipping eat here worsens score deficit without strong positional gains.\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Head at (9,5); likely moves DOWN to (9,4) for immediate eat (gain to 9). No direct threat this turn, but post-eat, their head at (9,4) could turn LEFT to (8,4), pressuring mid-right. Their longer body (9 segments) and top-right position give them upper-board advantage; avoid rushing there. Their safe moves: DOWN (eat) or LEFT (8,5), prioritizing eat.\n- **Board Risks**: All safe moves avoid walls/self/enemy. RIGHT eats and keeps y=3-4 open after growth (tail adds at old tail (3,3), extending up); no head-ons or tight spots. Board has clear corridors mid/lower left; enemy descending could cause future upper congestion.\n\n### Short-Term Plan (1-3 Turns Ahead)\nEat (8,3) via RIGHT to gain apple (to 7) and close gap\u2014enemy will likely eat (9,4) too, up to 9. Post-eat, head at (8,3); prioritize downward maneuvers toward (2,2) apple (e.g., DOWN to (8,2), then LEFT to chase (2,2) in 2-3 turns, avoiding enemy upper clustering). If enemy pivots left after eat, pivot DOWN/LEFT to lower board for safer eats at (7,0)/ (2,2); aim to reach 8+ before enemy chains upper apples.

Risk: If enemy (head at (9,4)) chooses LEFT to (8,4), head-on collision. Enemy's safe moves are only DOWN to (9,3) or LEFT to (8,4), no immediate apples, but LEFT could aim for mid-board/opening options. Avoid if possible to minimize deadly risk.\n  - DOWN to (8,2): Eats apple, gains 1 to 8 apples (closes gap to enemy's 9 temporarily). Opens clear leftward path toward (2,2) apple on same row (y=2); low risk (enemy can't reach (8,2) this turn from (9,4)). Immediate growth keeps game pace; board mid-lower left (rows 0-4) relatively open for follow-ups. No self/enemy collision threats; enemy would need multiple turns to interfere here.\n  - RIGHT to (9,3): No eat; moves closer to enemy head at (9,4), pressuring right column. Risk: If enemy chooses DOWN to (9,3), head-on collision. Board right is enemy-dominated/occupied, limiting future options without eats; why risk death when better eats exist?\n- **Apples and Opportunities**: DOWN eats promptly, risking no collision (enemy likely prioritizes LEFT for mobility or DOWN for unknown reasons, but neither hits me). Other apples: (2,2) next reachable via LEFT chain post-eat (direct row access); (7,0) further down/left, (9,1) enemy-adjacent. Enemy (9 apples) lacks immediate eats, so they stay ahead unless I chain eats.\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Head at (9,4); cannot UP (into own body at (9,5)). Safe: DOWN to (9,3) or LEFT to (8,4). No nearby apples; likely LEFT to gain mid-board space or reposition, but no guarantee\u2014both moves avoid walls/self.

If path blocked by own tail (new segments grow at old tail (3,3), extending right/vertical), detour DOWN to y=1 then LEFT pivot.

RIGHT (9,2, empty but risks head-on with enemy at (9,3), who can only safely go DOWN to (9,2), leading to collision and both die; enemy has 9 apples vs. my 8, so I'd lose).\n- **Safe Moves Evaluation**:\n  - DOWN to (8,1): Moves to lower row; next turn could LEFT to (7,1) or DOWN to (8,0), then toward (7,0) apple (at y=0). Enemy at (9,2) after this, can only DOWN to (9,1); if I then go RIGHT to (9,1) next turn toward the apple, enemy can also DOWN to (9,1), causing head-on collision (both die, enemy wins due to higher apples). Better to avoid RIGHT next turn if choosing this.\n  - LEFT to (7,2): Shifts left on open y=2 row toward (2,2) apple. Path to (2,2) is immediately clear on y=2 (can LEFT 5 more turns to eat without self-obstruction). Enemy heading to lower row leaves mid-board open; enemy's limited safe moves keep them pressured right-side and away from my path. This move stays at y=2, opening straight horizontal mobility and approaching an apple without immediate risk. No collision threats (enemy can't reach y=2 safely soon).\n- **Apples and Opportunities**: (2,2) is accessible via LEFT chain (clear path, ~5 turns to eat). DOWN offers indirect paths to (7,0) but risked by enemy mirroring RIGHT for (9,1) apple. Prioritize LEFT for quick, safe eat to close apple gap (enemy at 9). Enemy must prioritize survival (only DOWN safe); their upper-right bias keeps them distant.\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Head at (9,3); only safe move is DOWN to (9,2) (LEFT hits my body, dies). After move to (9,2), their next safe is DOWN to (9,1) (UP/LEFT die into own/my body, RIGHT off board). They can't interfere with my y=2 path; no nearby apples, so likely to descend right column.

No tight spaces yet; tail shifting post-move affects future options minimally at y=2. Growing via LEFT keeps me ahead without trapping.\n\n### Short-Term Plan (1-3 Turns Ahead)\nGo LEFT to (7,2) to start unchallenged path toward (2,2) at y=2 (eat in ~5 LEFT moves, increasing apples to 9 and tying/surpassing if enemy can't chain apples). Stay y=2 to dodge upward congestion and enemy; if own tail/(3,4) blocks (unlikely soon), detour DOWN one step at x=3 or 4 then LEFT back up.

Safe moves: UP (6,3, empty), DOWN (6,1, empty), LEFT (5,2, empty). RIGHT (7,2) hits own body (backwards move, death).\n- **Safe Moves Evaluation**:\n  - LEFT (5,2): Advances toward (2,2) apple on open y=2 row (3 more LEFT moves to eat, gaining 9 apples). Row remains empty and spacious, allowing detours if needed (e.g., UP or DOWN later). Low risk of trapping self soon.\n  - UP (6,3): Steps into y=3, but options are limited (LEFT to (5,3), DOWN back to (6,2) not viable; RIGHT to (7,3) hits own body). Could reach y=4 own body at (6,4) next turn via LEFT. Moderate risk of funnelling into tighter space or if enemy closes.\n  - DOWN (6,1): Moves to y=1 toward (7,0) apple (can reach in ~3 moves via (6,1) -> (7,1) -> (7,0)). Enemy is nearby at (9,1), could crowd row if he LEFT or follow. Risky if enemy pursues (e.g., he could reach y=1 and block escapes).\n- **Apples and Opportunities**: (2,2) is safest near-term priority \u2013 quick eat with open space for recovery/turns. (7,0) faster (reach in 3 moves) but invites enemy interference in narrower bottom rows. Upper apples ((1,6), (5,6), (2,8)) farther; prioritize after this eat to surpass enemy's 10 apples.\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Head at (9,1). Safe moves: LEFT (8,1, empty, puts him in y=1), DOWN (9,0, empty, toward (7,0)). Likely to pursue his right-column strategy or apple at (7,0), but could LEFT to y=1 to pressure if I go DOWN. Simultaneous moves mean potential alignments/collisions.\n- **Board Risks**: Row y=2 (my path) stays open (-wide with no obstacles until x=2); avoids bottlenecks. Enemy's presence at y=1/0 could become problematic if I divert DOWN. Avoid UP for now to escape limited options early. No imminent head-on threats based on simultaneous movement.\n\n### Short-Term Plan (Next 1-5 Turns)\nStick to LEFT path: Eat (2,2) for 9 apples (~3 more LEFT moves). Post-eat at (2,2), avoid immediate LEFT off-board ((1,2) -> (0,2, death)); instead, move UP to (2,3) or RIGHT to (3,2) if safe to open y-axis options and loop left around my lower body clusters, aiming for upper apples ((1,6) or (5,6) next) to reach 10+ apples while enemy (10 apples) navigates right/top areas. Monitor enemy for potential bottom-row crowding or head-ons; divert DOWN/Unturn only if he fully commits up/right.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT is into own body.\n- Immediate goal: Move closer to apple at (2,2) via the open left area while maintaining flexible paths, avoiding confinement near enemy segments (e.g., bottom-right where enemy head is at (7,0) and body extends upward).\n\n### Move Evaluation\n- **UP to (4,2)**: Positions me closer to the apple path toward (2,2) (then potentially LEFT to (3,2), LEFT to (2,2)). Keeps me somewhat separated from enemy but limits follow-up options to only two (LEFT and UP after checking; DOWN blocked by own body). Provides a direct approach to (2,2) in two more moves.\n- **DOWN to (4,0)**: Opens a lower path, potentially toward more open space, but it's farther from (2,2) (longer detour via left) and riskier near enemy head area\u2014only two follow-up options (LEFT and UP), and might box me in vertically if enemy moves down.\n- **LEFT to (3,1)**: Maintains momentum toward (2,2) (then UP to (3,2), LEFT to (2,2) in two moves) with the most follow-up options (three: UP, LEFT, DOWN). Aligns with the previous strategy of leveraging open left space for flexibility and apple access without closing in on enemy or my own trailing body.\n\n### Strategic Plan for Next Few Turns\nContinue prioritizing leftward movement to access the cluster of left-side apples ((2,2), (2,6), (1,6), (2,8)) for quick gains while keeping a buffer from the enemy snake. Avoid vertical dead-ends near the right edge where enemy blocks. Aim to consume 1-2 apples in the next 3-5 turns without extending too far into contested areas. If enemy approaches left, switch to defensive spacing rather than direct competition.\n\nLEFT",

I have a path to the left cluster via the open left space; enemy is distant but could pursue upwards or left.\n- Safe moves: UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0), LEFT to (2,1). RIGHT is into own body (4,1).\n\n### Move Evaluation\n- **UP to (3,2)**: Provides three follow-up options (LEFT to (2,2) for apple, UP to (3,3), RIGHT to (4,2) if not blocked). Keeps me in open space away from enemy, but moves slightly away from the immediate (2,2) apple path in next moves (would need an extra LEFT after).\n- **DOWN to (3,0)**: Only two follow-up options (LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0); UP reverses into body, DOWN off-board). Limits flexibility and takes me farther from apples, potentially into a dead-end near the bottom where enemy could maneuver.\n- **LEFT to (2,1)**: Keeps three follow-up options (UP to (2,2) for apple, LEFT to (1,1), DOWN to (2,0)). Directly advances toward (2,2) in one more move (then UP), aligns with planned leftward push for the apple cluster, maintains open space, and gives distance from enemy on the right. Avoids closing in on own trailing body or enemy.\n\n### Strategic Long-Term Plan\nPrioritize heading to (2,2) via LEFT then UP to eat it safely, aiming for growth to challenge the enemy (currently +3 apples ahead). After eating, navigate upward toward the y=6 cluster ((1,6), (2,6), (5,6)) via x=1-2 paths, using left tunnels to stay ahead and flexible. Watch for enemy moving UP into y=2-4; if enemy approaches, create space by circling or going DOWN/LEFT to avoid collisions. Target 2-3 apples in next 5-8 turns to narrow the gap, focusing on isolated left-side apples before enemy blocks them.\n\nLEFT",

Apples: Cluster at y=6 [(1,6), (2,6), (5,6)], and upper [(2,8), (2,9)].\n- Enemy from (3,0) will likely move UP to (3,1) or LEFT to (2,0) to avoid corner; no immediate threat to (2,4) for head-on collision this turn. Upper board has open space in x=2 (apples at y=6,8,9), but lower rows crowded with enemy and my tail.\n\n### Move Evaluation\n- Safe moves from (2,3): UP (2,4; empty, not into body or off-board), LEFT (1,3; empty), RIGHT (3,3; empty). DOWN invalid (into own body at 2,2).\n- **UP to (2,4)**: Positions head toward y=6 cluster via x=2 (direct path: up to 2,5 then 2,6 for apple in 2 moves). Keeps 3 safe follow-ups (up, left, right) after move; travels x=2 lane with multiple apples [(2,6),(2,8),(2,9)] helping pursue 50 apples. Avoids risk of crowding near enemy (who stays at x=3-ish potentially); matches prior plan for quick (2,6) eat.\n- **LEFT to (1,3)**: Good space (up, left, right follow-ups) entering x=1, leading to (1,6) in 3 ups; slower for additional y=6 apples if (2,6) lingers, and x=1 has fewer options above (no apples below y=6). Detour per last rationale; less efficient for high-density cluster.\n- **RIGHT to (3,3)**: 3 follow-ups available; shifts closer to enemy tail ([4,0]-[9,0]) but directly toward (5,6) potential. Risks future pressure if enemy rises via x=3/4, reducing flexibility in crowded lower-right; better to use later after y=6 eat.\n\n### Strategic Long-Term Plan\nPrioritize UP path for (2,6) eat in 2 moves [(2,4) this turn, (2,5) next, (2,6) eat]. After, pivot LEFT to (1,6) for another apple or RIGHT to (3,6) toward (5,6) to target 11+ apples soon. If enemy shifts RIGHT/UP toward x=3, counter with zigzags in x=1-2 or loop lower rows; upper x=2 offers uncontested access to (2,8)/(2,9) for 13+ apples to outpace rival. Avoid x=1x-3 RIGHT probes until y=6 eaten and growth secured.\n\nUP",

Fewer upper options; risks crowding x=1 if enemy rises.\n- **RIGHT to (3,5)**: Moves toward distant (5,6) but no quick eats; narrows against growing enemy, weaker on cluster access.\n\n### Strategic Long-Term Plan\nEat (2,6) for 10 apples now; flexibility remains. Next move from (2,6) post-grow: likely LEFT to (1,6) for +11 if safe, or UP to (2,7) toward (2,8)/(2,9) chain to aim 12-13 total. Monitor enemy left/up rise (they'd need 6+ turns to (1,6)); if invading x=1-2, zig right evade/loop low to reset below. Prioritize clearing edibles (y=6 then up) to hit 14+ mid-game, surpassing enemy 12 length bias.\n\nUP",

Skips eating this turn but maintains \u22652 safe follow-ups (UP/DOWN from (0,6)) and better positional advantage than committing UP/DOWN in contested x=1.\n\n### Strategic Long-Term Plan\nShift to x=0 to evade x=1 enemy upward progress and avoid potential x=1 collisions/head-ons (they\u2019ll likely hit y=3+/apples higher-isolated; we stay below).

Enemy at (1,4) is unlikely to block this turn, as their safe moves are UP or LEFT, but neither reaches y=7 quickly.
