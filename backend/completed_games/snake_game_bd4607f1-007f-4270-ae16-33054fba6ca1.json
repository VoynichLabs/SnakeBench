Snake #1 is all the way at (9,9), no threat. My body is non-existent. It's safe!\n*   **DOWN (y-1) to (5, 0):** Empty space. Also safe.\n*   **LEFT (x-1) to (4, 1):** Empty space. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (x+1) to (6, 1):** Empty space. Safe.\n\nALL MOVES ARE SAFE! NO CHANCE OF COLLISION. WE'RE FREE!\n\n**STRATEGY & APPLE PLANNING:**\nOkay, looking at the apple drops... we're surrounded by options! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n*   UP gets us that sweet, sweet content at (5,2) IMMEDIATELY. Growing early gives us more presence on the board.\n*   There's also an apple at (4,3) and (1,2) nearby. We could set up a path to grab a few in a row.\n\n**BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OPPONENT?** \ud83d\udc0d\nSnake #1 is chilling in the top-right corner. Right now, they're far away, but we need to think long-term. The board is 10x10. If we camp the center and control the apple-rich middle-left area, we can starve them out. They have apples near them too at (8,7) and (8,8), but we can't let them get a huge lead.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME (READ THIS NEXT TURN):**\nYo future self! We're going for early growth and board control. After grabbing (5,2), look to weave through the cluster of apples in columns 1-4. Stay flexible, avoid getting pinned against the walls. Keep an eye on snake #1's movement \u2013 if they start coming down, we might need to cut them off.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nGoing UP grabs an apple instantly, gets us bigger, and keeps all options open. It's the most aggressive, content-generating play. LET'S GET THIS BREAD! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

PERFECT.\n- **LEFT**: (7,9) Empty dot. Safe, heads toward (6,9) apple next. Solid escape.\n- **RIGHT**: (9,9) Empty corner. Safe, but loops back\u2014less aggressive.\n\nSAFE MOVES: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But DOWN EATS IMMEDIATELY\u2014grows us FASTER than him, controls top space! LEFT teases (6,9), but why delay the apple when (8,8) is FREE? RIGHT? Nah, corner trap vibes.

DOWN slaps\u2014grow, flex, then coil clockwise to trap him mid-board! Chat, you feelin' this W vision?! \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Turn 1: DOWN eat (8,8), grow to 2.

TIME TO KEEP THIS MOMENTUM GOING! \ud83d\ude24 LET'S SEE WHAT'S ON THE MENU.\n\nCURRENT HEAD POSITION: (5, 2)\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK (DON'T CHOKE NOW):**\n\nLet's think one step ahead, Chat! We gotta predict where the enemy is going! Snake #1's head is at (8,9). What moves can they make? \ud83e\udde0\n\n*   **DOWN to (8,8):** That's an APPLE for them! \ud83c\udf4e This is the most likely play, right?

We gotta be aware of that!\n\nNow for ME: My head is at (5,2), body is at (5,1). Let's check my four options:\n\n*   **UP (y+1) to (5, 3):** Empty space. \u2705 SAFE! (Unless enemy somehow gets here, but unlikely this turn)\n*   **DOWN (y-1) to (5, 1):** That's my own body! \u274c (DEATH) Don't go backwards, Chat!\n*   **LEFT (x-1) to (4, 2):** Empty space. \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **RIGHT (x+1) to (6, 2):** Empty space. \u2705 SAFE!\n\nDOWN IS ILLEGAL! We eliminate that. So my viable moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGY & APPLE HUNTING:**\nOkay, we're right in the middle of a ton of apples! Look at this buffet! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\n*   **UP** gets us closer to (4,3) and (2,3). Also sets us up to move towards the top-left quadrant which is APPLE CITY! (0,8), (1,5), (0,1)...\n*   **LEFT** gets us closer to (4,3) and (1,2). Also heading towards that same apple-rich left side.\n*   **RIGHT** heads towards (6,9), but that's a long way off. Puts us closer to the enemy's side. Seems risky long-term. We want to CONTROL the board, not chase. \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**OPPONENT ANALYSIS: \ud83d\udc0d**\nEnemy is likely grabbing the apple at (8,8). That will grow them to length 2. We need to build a lead! They are trapped in the corner for now, but if they get bigger they'll try to break out. We need to DOMINATE the left side and the center, cutting off their access to all these apples. Starve 'em out! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nYo future self! We are executing the BOX-OUT strategy! We're claiming the left side of the board. After this move, we want to path towards the cluster of apples at (4,3), (1,2), and (2,3). Weave through them, get huge, and build a wall with our body between the enemy and the majority of the apples. Let them rot in their corner! Keep an eye on their growth, but focus on our own path to victory.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nRIGHT feels like it's playing into their territory. DOWN is death. So it's between UP and LEFT. Both are great for the long-term plan. UP feels more direct towards the next big cluster. Let's go UP to (5,3) and then next turn we can go LEFT to (4,3) for another APPLE! \ud83d\ude80 That's the content pipeline!\n\nUP",

It also keeps us squarely in the left-side apple pipeline. From (4,3), our next moves could be UP to (4,4), DOWN to (4,2), or LEFT to (3,3). Lots of options!\n*   **UP to (5,4):** SAFE, but it's moving us AWAY from the immediate apple cluster. Puts us in a more central but emptier area. Less aggressive.\n*   **RIGHT to (6,3):** WHY WOULD WE DO THIS, CHAT? \ud83d\ude29 That's playing into the center/right, closer to the enemy's eventual breakout path. We abandon our strategic advantage on the left!\n\nThe choice is CLEAR. We go for the content! We go for the lead! We STICK TO THE PLAN!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\n\nLEFT",

Our goal now is to build a massive lead and maybe even trap him later if he tries to break out!\n\n*   **LEFT to (3,3):** Good move, keeps us central to the cluster. Puts us right next to the apple at (2,3).\n*   **UP to (4,4):** Also a great move! Puts us on a direct path to (3,4) and then (4,6). Very strong.\n*   **DOWN to (4,2):** Solid move, gets us closer to (2,1) and (2,3).\n\nAll three moves are excellent! We can't go wrong! Let's pick the one that sets up the *most* future options.\n\nFrom (3,3):\n*   Next moves: UP to (3,4) [APPLE!], DOWN to (3,2), LEFT to (2,3) [APPLE!], RIGHT to (4,3) [our old spot, will be empty]. 4 options! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nFrom (4,4):\n*   Next moves: UP to (4,5), DOWN to (4,3) [our old spot], LEFT to (3,4) [APPLE!], RIGHT to (5,4). 4 options! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nFrom (4,2):\n*   Next moves: UP to (4,3) [our old spot], DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), RIGHT to (5,2) [our old body, will be gone next turn?]. 3-4 options!

WE ARE DOMINATING THE MAP CONTROL! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FOR US:**\n\nFrom our head at (3,3):\n*   **UP (y+1) to (3, 4):** THAT'S AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705 SAFE! (We grow, body segment gets added behind head next turn)\n*   **DOWN (y-1) to (3, 2):** EMPTY. \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **LEFT (x-1) to (2, 3):** THAT'S ALSO AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705 SAFE! (We grow!)\n*   **RIGHT (x+1) to (4, 3):** That's OUR OWN BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Don't go back!\n\nRIGHT is DEATH ZONE! We have THREE AMAZING OPTIONS: UP (APPLE), DOWN (SAFE), LEFT (APPLE). ARE YOU KIDDING ME? CHAT WE ARE FEASTING! \ud83d\ude4f\n\n**APPLE CHECK:**\nBRO, WE HAVE APPLES ON TWO SIDES! THIS IS A BUFFET!\n*   **UP (3,4):** LITERALLY AN APPLE. EZ CONTENT.\n*   **LEFT (2,3):** LITERALLY AN APPLE. EZ CONTENT.\n*   **DOWN (3,2):** No apple, but gets us closer to the cluster at (2,1) and (1,2).\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION: \ud83d\udc0d**\n\nThey are STILL at (7,7). Their moves from last turn are the same:\n*   UP (7,8): SAFE.\n*   DOWN (7,6): SAFE.\n*   LEFT (6,7): SAFE.\n*   RIGHT (8,7): Their OWN BODY! \u274c DEATH.\nSo they have 3 options. They might try to break out towards the center. BUT THEY ARE SO FAR AWAY! NO CHANCE OF HEAD-ON COLLISION THIS TURN! WE ARE FREE TO FARM!\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\n\nCHAT, WE ARE EXECUTING THE PLAN PERFECTLY! LEFT-SIDE DOMINANCE IS REAL! The enemy is still caged. We have TWO APPLES within one move! The only question is, which one sets up a better long-term path?\n*   **Taking the UP apple (3,4)** puts us in a great spot to then go LEFT to (2,4) or further UP towards (3,5)/(4,6). Very strong central control.\n*   **Taking the LEFT apple (2,3)** claims the left side HARD and lets us loop down to (2,1) and (1,2). Also incredibly strong.\n\nHonestly, both are S-Tier moves. But going LEFT to (2,3) feels more aggressive. It pushes our territory further left and cuts off any potential escape route for the enemy down the line if they get brave. WE ARE GOING FOR THE THROAT! LET'S TAKE THE LEFT APPLE AND SOLIDIFY OUR DOMINANCE! THIS IS HOW YOU WIN GAMES!\n\nLEFT",

LET'S GOOO! \ud83e\udd14\n\n\ud83e\udd14 **ENEMY PREDICTION & COLLISION CHECK:**\nYO, SNAKE #1'S HEAD IS AT (6,8)! THEY ARE MILES AWAY! ZERO CHANCE OF A HEAD-ON COLLISION THIS TURN. WE ARE FREE TO FARM! BUT... we gotta think one step ahead. If they go LEFT to (5,8), they're still trapped. If they go DOWN to (6,7), that's their body, so they can't. Their only real safe move is UP to (6,9) towards that apple. They're not our problem right now.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE VISION & PATHING:**\n*   **DOWN to (2,1):** Eats the apple! But then what? Look at the board! We'd be in a bit of a corner. Our next moves from (2,1) would be UP (back to our body at (2,2)? NO!), LEFT to (1,1) (empty), or RIGHT to (3,1) (empty). That's only two safe moves, and one is a dead-end path. RISKY!\n*   **LEFT to (1,2):** EATS AN APPLE! \ud83c\udfaf And look at the future! From (1,2), our options are HUGE: UP to (1,3) (empty, opens path to (1,5) and (1,7)), DOWN to (1,1) (empty), or RIGHT (back to our body at (2,2)? NO!). So two great, open paths that lead to MORE apples! THIS IS THE PLAY!\n*   **RIGHT to (3,2):** No apple. Puts us closer to the center. But chat, why go for an empty space when we have two juicy apples right beside us? We're leaving content on the table! That's bad for the stream! \u274c\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE MELO:**\nCHAT, THE PLAN IS LOCKING IN! LEFT-SIDE DOMINANCE IS KEY! We go LEFT, eat the apple at (1,2). Next turn, we can go UP to (1,3) to start a path towards the apple cluster at (1,5) and (1,7). Alternatively, we could go DOWN to (1,1) to clean up that area. This move gives us maximum flexibility and keeps us far from the enemy. We are BOXING HIM OUT of the entire left side! Once we control the left, we can push him into the walls! THIS IS HOW WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nLEFT",

So their ONLY move is DOWN to (7,8)! They are STUCK on that top edge! They are NO DIRECT THREAT to us this turn! We can IGNORE THEM FOR NOW!\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE VISION:**\n*   **UP to (0,3):** No immediate apple, but it opens a path NORTH towards the (1,5), (1,7), and (0,8) apple cluster! STRATEGIC!\n*   **DOWN to (0,1):** DIRECT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e WE GET FAT! THIS IS CONTENT! And guess what's next? From (0,1), our options would be UP (back to current head, a bit risky), or RIGHT to (1,1) which is EMPTY and has an apple at (2,1) nearby! It's not a dead end!\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **LONG-TERM STRATEGY & RATIONALE:**\nCHAT, WE HAVE A CHOICE! GO UP FOR THE LONG GAME AND MAP CONTROL, OR GO DOWN FOR THE IMMEDIATE APPLE AND AGGRESSIVE GROWTH!\n\nLAST TURN WE TALKED ABOUT LEFT-SIDE DOMINANCE! IF WE GO DOWN, WE SECURE THE BOTTOM-LEFT CORNER, EAT AN APPLE, AND CAN START WORKING OUR WAY RIGHT AL THE BOTTOM! WE GET BIGGER, MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE ENEMY TO BOX US LATER. GOING UP IS SAFER SPACE WISE, BUT WE PASS ON AN EASY MEAL. IN A RACE TO 30, WE NEED TO BE EFFICIENT! TAKING THE GUARANTEED APPLE WHILE THE ENEMY IS TRAPPED IS THE PLAY! LET'S GET THAT LEAD!\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** AFTER EATING THE (0,1) APPLE, ASSESS MOVES FROM (0,1). LIKELY GO RIGHT TO (1,1) TO CONTINUE SNAKING ALONG THE BOTTOM, SCOOPING UP (2,1) AND HEADING TOWARDS THE (7,0) APPLE. KEEP THE ENEMY PINNED ON THE TOP!\n\nTHE CLUTCH PLAY IS TO GET BIGGER NOW! WE GO FOR THE APPLE!\n\nDOWN",

They are NOT a direct threat this turn, but they're FARMING! We gotta keep pace!\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE VISION & FUTURE PATHS:**\n*   **RIGHT to (1,1):** This is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY!

That's a BIT of a commitment, but it gets us a guaranteed apple next turn!\n*   **DOWN to (0,0):** This is the SAFE, CONTROL PLAY! We tuck into the bottom-left corner. From (0,0), our ONLY move is UP to (0,1)... which is our current head position. That's fine for one turn, but it's a dead-end path. We'd be stuck just moving between (0,0) and (0,1) until we find another way out. This feels like getting stuck!\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **LONG-TERM STRATEGY & RATIONALE:**\nCHAT! WE CAN'T GET BOXED IN! GOING DOWN TO (0,0) TRAPS US! We lose all momentum! The power move is to go RIGHT! We secure the bottom edge, line up that easy (2,1) apple, and start moving towards the (7,0) apple! We need to DOMINATE THE BOTTOM ROW and cut the enemy off from those apples! They're busy on the top, we'll own the bottom! This is how we build a lead and set up for the late-game box!\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** FROM (1,1), TAKE THE (2,1) APPLE.

TURN 10 AND WE'RE LEADING WITH 5 APPLES! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e TIME TO MAINTAIN OUR DOMINANCE!\n\nLOOK AT OUR BIG BOI SNAKE AT (1,1)! Let's check ALL four directions for our next BIG BRAIN MOVE! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FROM (1,1):**\n\n*   **UP to (1,2):** \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY SEGMENT! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Don't eat yourself!\n*   **DOWN to (1,0):** EMPTY CELL! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **LEFT to (0,1):** \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY SEGMENT! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!\n*   **RIGHT to (2,1):** \ud83c\udf4e THAT'S AN APPLE! \u2705 SAFE!\n\nOKAY CHAT, WE HAVE TWO REAL MOVES: **DOWN** OR **RIGHT**! STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GATE!\n\n**APPLE VISION:**\nRIGHT IS A DIRECT APPLE GRAB AT (2,1)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e THAT'S HOW WE BUILD OUR LEAD! DOWN TO (1,0) IS JUST AN EMPTY SPACE.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (SNAKE #1):**\nTHEY'RE AT (7,7)! Their last body part is (7,8). Let's predict their moves, chat!\n*   They can't go UP to (7,8) - that's their body! \u274c\n*   LEFT to (6,7) is EMPTY! \u2705\n*   RIGHT to (8,7) is EMPTY! \u2705\n*   DOWN to (7,6) is EMPTY AND HAS AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705\n\nTHEY ARE GONNA SEE THAT JUICY (7,6) APPLE! THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING DOWN! They are farming the top-right quadrant, staying FAR AWAY from us for now. NO DIRECT THREAT THIS TURN! We can play greedy!\n\n**FUTURE PATHS & LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\n*   **IF WE GO RIGHT to (2,1):** We get the apple and grow! \ud83c\udf4e Our new head is on the apple. Our tail will move up, so our body becomes: Head @ (2,1), then (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3). From (2,1), our next moves would be UP (body), DOWN (empty), LEFT (body), RIGHT (to (3,1) - empty). So we'd have two safe moves next turn: DOWN or RIGHT. This keeps us flexible and aggressive, moving along the bottom towards the (7,0) apple! LET'S GOOO!\n\n*   **IF WE GO DOWN to (1,0):** This is a SUPER SAFE, control move. We tuck into the bottom row. From (1,0), we can go LEFT to (0,0) (empty) or RIGHT to (2,0) (empty). So we'd have options. BUT we miss the apple! We are giving up free content and letting the enemy potentially catch up! We don't wanna play scared, chat!\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\nWE ARE HERE TO WIN, NOT TO HIDE! GOING RIGHT GETS US AN APPLE, EXTENDS OUR LEAD TO 6-4, AND KEEPS US ON A STRONG PATH ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE MAP! WE ARE BOXING *THEM* IN BY CONTROLLING THE BOTTOM ROW AND ITS APPLES!\n\n**THE PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** FROM OUR NEW HEAD AT (2,1), WE ASSESS. OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO CONTINUE MOVING RIGHT ALONG Y=1 OR Y=0 TOWARDS THE (7,0) APPLE, CUTTING THE BOARD IN HALF AND DENYING THE ENEMY ACCESS! STAY AGGRESSIVE! STAY FARMING!\n\nTHIS IS THE WAY! LET'S GO RIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

HE'S BIGGER (8 APPLES VS OUR 6)! A HEAD-ON FIGHT IS SUICIDE! WE NEED TO MANEUVER AND CUT HIM OFF LATER! LET'S GO **LEFT** OR **UP** TO GET AWAY FROM HIM AND TOWARD THE OPEN LEFT SIDE OF THE BOARD WHERE THERE ARE APPLES! GOING RIGHT TOWARD (7,1) PUTS US RIGHT IN HIS FACE! IF HE GOES RIGHT TO THE APPLE, WE'RE SAFE... BUT IF HE GOES DOWN OR LEFT, WE'RE DEAD MEAT! TOO RISKY! \u274c\n\n**THE SMART PLAY IS TO DISENGAGE!** LET'S GO **LEFT** TO (5,1)! THIS MOVES US AWAY FROM THE DANGER ZONE AND TOWARD THE SAFE, OPEN LEFT SIDE WITH APPLES! FROM (5,1), OUR NEXT MOVES CAN BE UP, LEFT, OR EVEN DOWN ONCE OUR TAIL MOVES! MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY! THIS IS THE PRO GAMER MOVE! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** Keep moving left/up to collect the apples on the left side (1,5), (3,4). Avoid the enemy's territory on the right. Let him overextend and maybe trap himself! We play the long game!\n\nLEFT",
