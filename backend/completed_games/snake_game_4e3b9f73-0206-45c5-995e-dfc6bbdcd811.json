Moving backwards is impossible (no body yet), but I must avoid walls and enemy snake heads/bodies.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (2,1), Body empty. Single segment.\n- **Apples:** There are many apples on the board. Closest ones to me: (5,0) is 5 units down (Distance 5), (5,3) is 2 units down (Distance 2), (2,5) is 3 units left (Distance 3), (1,5) is 4 units left (Distance 4). (8,0) and (7,3) are also relatively close but further.\n- **Enemy Intent:** The enemy is at (2,1). The nearest apples to the enemy are (1,0) (distance 2), (5,1) (distance 4), and (2,5) (distance 4). It is likely the enemy will move toward one of these. (1,0) is the closest.\n\n**Potential Moves:**\n1.  **UP (5,6):** Empty. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (5,4):** Empty. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (4,5):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (6,5):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**Evaluating Moves against Enemy Strategy:**\nThe enemy snake is at (2,1). If it moves toward (1,0) (likely), it will go DOWN to (2,0) or LEFT to (1,1).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), it might die on the next turn if it moves Left into (1,0) and I am not there, or it might grow. Regardless, (2,0) is far from me.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (2,2), it moves toward (2,5). This puts it closer to apples I might want (like (2,5)).\nHowever, I am at (5,5). My priority is to secure apples and ensure survival.\n\n**Target Selection:**\n- **Apple at (5,3):** Distance 2 (Down, Down).\n- **Apple at (2,5):** Distance 3 (Left, Left, Left).\n- **Apple at (5,0):** Distance 5 (Down x5).\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (5,4), I am closer to (5,3). From (5,4), I can reach (5,3) next turn.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (4,5), I am closer to (2,5). From (4,5), I can reach (2,5) in 2 more moves.\nIf I move **UP** to (5,6), I am heading toward (8,6) or (9,8), which are further away.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6,5), I am moving toward (8,6), which is distance 3 from there.\n\n**Comparing (5,3) vs (2,5):**\n- (5,3) is safer because it is directly below my current path. The enemy is at (2,1), far to the left. The enemy is unlikely to contest (5,3) in the immediate future. The cell (5,2) is empty. (5,1) has an apple, and (5,0) has an apple.\n- (2,5) is closer in terms of absolute distance (3 vs 2), but (2,5) is near the enemy's potential path. If the enemy moves UP to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3), it threatens that area.\n- However, (5,0) is also an apple. If I go DOWN, I pass (5,3) and head toward (5,0). (5,1) is also an apple on the way.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (5,4) is the safest and most strategic move. It heads directly toward a cluster of apples at (5,3), (5,1), and (5,0). It keeps me in the center of the board's right side, avoiding the enemy who is on the left side (x=2). This maximizes my distance from the enemy, minimizing the chance of a head-on collision or accidental body contact in future turns. Moving LEFT towards (2,5) brings me closer to the enemy's territory unnecessarily.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (5,4). On the next turn, move DOWN to (5,3) to eat the apple. This will grow my snake, giving me a tail at (5,5). After eating (5,3), I will likely move toward (5,1) or (5,0) depending on the enemy's position.\n\nDOWN",

A direct path from (2,1) goes RIGHT to (3,1) then UP to (3,2) and (3,3). Going RIGHT now reduces the distance to that apple and keeps us in open space away from the enemy.\n- Long-term plan: move toward (3,3) to eat, then reassess to chase nearby apples (e.g., (5,3) or (5,1)) while avoiding traps and head-on collisions.\n\nPlan:\n- First move toward the nearest appealing apple by stepping RIGHT to (3,1).

I moved DOWN from (5,5).\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (3,1), Body empty.\n- **Apples:** My target apples are (5,3), (5,1), (5,0) in the vertical column to my left, and (2,5) is also an option but further and potentially contested.\n- **Enemy Intent:** The enemy is at (3,1). The closest apples to it are (1,0) (distance 4), (5,1) (distance 3), and (3,3) (distance 2). The enemy is likely to target the apple at (3,3) or (5,1).\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n1.  **UP (5,5):** The cell I just came from. While technically empty (since I moved out of it), moving backwards immediately is risky if I grow, but I haven't eaten yet. It moves me away from my target apples.\n2.  **DOWN (5,3):** **Target Apple.** This is a highly efficient move. It eats an apple, increasing my score to 1 and growing my snake (body will become (5,4)). This secures an immediate point and extends my reach.\n3.  **LEFT (4,4):** Empty. Moves me closer to the vertical line of apples (5,3), (5,1), (5,0). From here, I could go DOWN to (4,3) or LEFT to (3,4).\n4.  **RIGHT (6,4):** Empty. Moves me away from my targets toward the empty right side of the board.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n- **DOWN (5,3)** is the clear best move. It grabs an apple immediately. The cell (5,3) is currently safe (empty). The enemy is at (3,1) and cannot reach (5,3) this turn (distance is too great). Even if the enemy moves UP to (3,2), it is not a collision risk.\n- Securing the apple at (5,3) creates a body segment at (5,4). This protects my flank slightly.\n- After eating (5,3), my next target will be (5,1) or (5,0), which are directly below, allowing for a continuous efficient path.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **DOWN** to (5,3) to eat the apple. This is the safest and most advantageous move, securing points and expanding my snake while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n**Plan:**\nEat the apple at (5,3). Then, plan to move DOWN to (5,2) or (5,1) to continue the chain of apples on this column.

I ate the apple at (5,3) last turn (implied by growth to 2 segments and score increase to 1, consistent with turn 1 logic).\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (3,2). (It moved UP from (3,1) as anticipated in the previous rationale).\n- **Apples:** The immediate vertical line below me contains apples at (5,1) and (5,0). The apple at (5,3) is gone (eaten).\n- **Board Context:** My body occupies (5,4). The enemy is at (3,2). There are no other immediate threats in the adjacent cells.\n\n**Move Evaluation (from Head at (5,3)):**\n1.  **UP (5,4):** **DEADLY.** This is a trap. My body is currently at (5,4). Moving into my own body results in immediate death. The previous rationale noted that eating (5,3) would create a body segment at (5,4), which now blocks this retreat path.\n2.  **LEFT (4,3):** **Safe.** Empty. Moves me toward the left-side apples ((3,3), (1,4), etc.) and away from my own body. From (4,3), I have open space.\n3.  **RIGHT (6,3):** **Safe.** Empty. Moves me toward the right side of the board. This area is largely empty but also lacks immediate apples, potentially leaving me stranded if the enemy claims the center.\n4.  **DOWN (5,2):** **Safe.** Empty. Moves me toward the apple at (5,1) and (5,0). This is the most direct continuation of my previous plan to clear the vertical column.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI must avoid moving UP into my own body. Between LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN:\n- **DOWN** allows me to claim the next apple in the column (5,1) efficiently. My body is at (5,4), so the path down is currently open. The enemy is at (3,2) and cannot reach (5,2) this turn.\n- **LEFT** is a safe alternative if the enemy becomes aggressive, but it abandons the immediate apple at (5,1).\n- **RIGHT** moves away from all current apples and is suboptimal.\n\nChoosing **DOWN** to (5,2) positions me to eat the apple at (5,1) on the subsequent turn, maintaining my score advantage. I must ensure the enemy does not intercept this path, but currently, they are focused elsewhere (likely toward the center or left-side apples).\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nMove DOWN to (5,2). Next turn, move DOWN to (5,1) to eat the apple and grow again. Monitor the enemy's movement toward the center apples (e.g., (3,3)) to ensure they do not cut me off or force a collision.\n\nDOWN",

The only cell my body occupies is (5, 3). The path to (5, 1) is clear of my own body. The enemy snake is at (3, 3).

I must ensure I do not get trapped. My body is currently vertical at (5, 3). By eating downwards, I maintain this vertical alignment. I need to be careful not to move left or right immediately after eating if it creates a trap, but for this turn, eating is safe and beneficial.\n\nThe enemy is at (3, 3).

I will be at (5, 1). The next apple is at (5, 0). I should continue DOWN to (5, 0) if safe. I must watch the enemy snake's movement. If it moves aggressively to cut me off, I may need to divert.

However, looking at the board for y=2, there is 'T' at (5, 2). This is confusing because my body is listed as [(5, 2), (5, 3)]. Let's verify the board coordinates carefully. The provided text says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (5, 1), Body: [(5, 2), (5, 3)]\". The board shows '1' at (5, 1). The board shows 'T' at (5, 2) and (5, 3). This matches.\n    *   Enemy: '0' at (3, 3) and 'T' at (3, 2). So the enemy is also vertical.\n*   **Apples:** There is an apple at (5, 0) directly below me. There is also an apple at (5, 1) which is my current location (meaning I just ate it? No, the prompt says \"Your last move information: ... DOWN\", and the turn is 4. Wait, the prompt says \"Turn: 4 / 150\" and \"Your last move information: ... DOWN\". If I moved DOWN from (5, 2) to (5, 1), and there was an apple at (5, 1), I would have eaten it. The \"My snake\" state shows Head (5, 1) and Apples collected: 2. This is consistent with having just eaten.\n    *   *Correction:* The prompt asks me to make a move for the *next* turn. I am at (5, 1). The apple at (5, 1) is likely gone (since I'm there), but the prompt lists it under \"Apples at:\". This might be a display artifact or the apple is still there (if I didn't eat it?). No, if I moved there and it had an apple, I grew. The \"Scores so far\" show I have 2 apples. The \"Apples at\" list is static for the turn. I must assume the apple at (5, 1) is effectively consumed or occupied by my head. I should look for available apples.\n    *   Available apples relevant to my path:\n        *   (5, 0): 1 step down.\n        *   (6, 1): 1 step right.\n        *   (4, 1): 1 step left.\n        *   (1, 0): Far down-left.\n        *   (2, 5) / (2, 7) / (2, 9): Up and left.\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate fatal moves.**\n\n*   **UP to (5, 2):** My body is at (5, 2).

I have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n*   **Strategy:** I need to eat apples to win. I am at score 2, Enemy is at 1. I need to grow.\n    *   **Option DOWN (5, 0):** Eat apple (5, 0). My head moves to (5, 0). My body becomes [(5, 1), (5, 2)]. The tail remains (5, 3) because I ate. My new shape is vertical at x=5.\n    *   **Option RIGHT (6, 1):** Eat apple (6, 1). My head moves to (6, 1). My body becomes [(5, 1), (5, 2)]. Vertical shape at x=5, head at x=6.\n    *   **Option LEFT (4, 1):** Move to empty space. No apple. My head moves to (4, 1). My body becomes [(5, 1), (5, 2)]. Vertical shape at x=5, head at x=4.\n\n**Comparing the options:**\n\n1.  **DOWN (5, 0):** This is a direct eat. It keeps me in the \"column 5\" vertical strip which currently seems clear. However, (5, 0) is a corner column (x=5, y=0). If I go DOWN, next turn I will be at (5, 0). From (5, 0), my only moves will be UP (back to (5, 1), which will be my body), LEFT (4, 0), or RIGHT (6, 0).\n    *   Row 0: \"A A . . . A . . A\"\n    *   (4, 0) is 'A' (Apple).\n    *   (6, 0) is '.' (Empty).\n    *   So if I go DOWN to (5, 0), next turn I can go LEFT to (4, 0) to eat another apple, or RIGHT to (6, 0).\n    *   This seems like a good chain: (5, 1) -> (5, 0) -> (4, 0).\n\n2.  **RIGHT (6, 1):** Eat apple (6, 1).\n    *   Next turn at (6, 1). Moves: UP (6, 2), DOWN (6, 0), LEFT (5, 1 - Body), RIGHT (7, 1).\n    *   (6, 2) is empty. (6, 0) is empty. (7, 1) is empty.\n    *   This opens up the center/right side.\n\n3.  **LEFT (4, 1):** No apple.\n    *   Next turn at (4, 1). Moves: UP (4, 2), DOWN (4, 0 - Apple), LEFT (3, 1), RIGHT (5, 1 - Body).\n    *   (4, 0) is an apple. This is also a viable path.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe most immediate gain is eating an apple. Both DOWN and RIGHT offer an apple immediately. LEFT does not.\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:\n*   DOWN (5, 0) puts me in the corner (x=5, y=0). While it gives immediate points, it limits my immediate escape routes to LEFT (4,0) or RIGHT (6,0). If I get stuck, I'm in a corner.\n*   RIGHT (6, 1) puts me at (6, 1). This is safer positionally as it's not on the absolute edge of the board (though x=6 is fine). It gives me options: UP to (6, 2), DOWN to (6, 0), RIGHT to (7, 1). It keeps me more central.\n\nHowever, looking at the apple distribution:\n*   (5, 0) and (4, 0) are adjacent apples on the bottom row.\n*   (6, 1) is an apple, but there isn't an obvious chain immediately next to it except (5, 0) or (7, 3).\n\nLet's look at the Enemy.\nEnemy is at (3, 3). It is far away.\nMy body is at (5, 2), (5, 3).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 1):\nHead: (6, 1)\nBody: (5, 1), (5, 2)\nThis looks safe.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 0):\nHead: (5, 0)\nBody: (5, 1), (5, 2)\nThis also looks safe.\n\nWhy did the user's last move rationale suggest going DOWN?\nThe user's last move (Turn 3) was DOWN from (5, 2) to (5, 1). The rationale stated: \"I need to evaluate the possible moves... DOWN to (5, 1)... Eating the apple... is the most advantageous move... Plan for Next Turn: After moving DOWN to (5, 1)... I will be at (5, 1). The next apple is at (5, 0). I should continue DOWN to (5, 0) if safe.\"\n\nThe user's plan was to go DOWN.\nThe user is currently at (5, 1).\nThe apple at (5, 0) is directly below.\nThis is a clear, safe path.\nIs there any reason *not* to go DOWN?\nThe enemy is at (3, 3).\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 0), I am at the bottom edge.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 1), I am at y=1.\nBoth are safe.\nHowever, following the user's established plan is generally good if the plan was sound.\nThe user planned: (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0).\nThis is a simple vertical eat.\nThe only danger is if the enemy moves to block or crash into me.\nEnemy at (3, 3).\nDistance from Enemy Head (3, 3) to my target (5, 0):\nDelta X = 2, Delta Y = 3. Total distance 5.\nEnemy moves 1 step per turn.\nIt cannot reach (5, 0) this turn.\nIt cannot even threaten to head-on collision this turn unless I move into it.\nI am moving DOWN to (5, 0). Enemy is at (3, 3). They are far apart.\n\nSo, DOWN is safe and follows the plan.\nIs there any advantage to deviating?\nGoing RIGHT to (6, 1) gets an apple too.\nBut DOWN to (5, 0) is the path the user planned.\nThe user rationale said: \"I must ensure I do not get trapped... I need to be careful not to move left or right immediately after eating if it creates a trap, but for this turn, eating is safe and beneficial.\"\nActually, the user's last rationale was planning for the move *I am about to make*.\nWait, the prompt says \"Turn: 4 / 150\".\nMy last move (Turn 3) was DOWN to (5, 1).\nI am now choosing the move for Turn 4.\nThe user's \"Last Rationale\" was for the move made in Turn 3 (DOWN to (5, 1)). It ended with \"Plan for Next Turn: ... The next apple is at (5, 0). I should continue DOWN to (5, 0) if safe.\"\nSo the user *wants* to go DOWN.\n\nIs (5, 0) safe?\nYes.\nIs there any reason to switch to RIGHT?\nRIGHT is also safe.\nHowever, DOWN is the continuation of the current momentum.\nLet's check if (5, 0) is truly safe from future entrapment.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 0) and eat:\nMy body becomes (5, 1), (5, 2).\nNext turn (Turn 5), I am at (5, 0).\nFrom (5, 0), I can go LEFT to (4, 0) (Apple) or RIGHT to (6, 0) (Empty).\n(4, 0) is an apple.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 0) on Turn 5:\nHead (4, 0). Body (5, 0), (5, 1).\nFrom (4, 0), I can go UP (4, 1), LEFT (3, 0), or BACK (5, 0 - body).\n(4, 1) is empty.\n(3, 0) is Empty (Row 0: A A . . . A . . A -> (3, 0) is '.').\nSo the bottom row is quite open.\nGoing DOWN seems to open up the bottom row nicely.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 0: \"A A . . . A . . A\"\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n(0, 0): A\n(1, 0): A\n(2, 0): .\n(3, 0): .\n(4, 0): .\n(5, 0): A (My target)\n(6, 0): .\n(7, 0): .\n(8, 0): A\n(9, 0): A\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 0):\nI eat the apple.\nNext turn I can go LEFT to (4, 0) (empty).\nThen NEXT NEXT turn I can go LEFT to (3, 0) (empty) or UP.\nOr I can go RIGHT to (6, 0) (empty).\nThe bottom row seems to have a lot of empty space except for the apples.\nThis seems like a safe farming route.\n\nWhat if I go RIGHT to (6, 1)?\nI eat the apple at (6, 1).\nNext turn I am at (6, 1).\nFrom there, I can go DOWN to (6, 0) (empty).\nOr UP to (6, 2) (empty).\nOr RIGHT to (7, 1) (empty).\n(6, 0) is empty.\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 0) on Turn 5:\nI am at (6, 0).\nFrom (6, 0), I can go LEFT (5, 0 - Apple, but I haven't eaten it yet), RIGHT (7, 0 - empty).\n(5, 0) is still an apple.\nSo I can still go back to (5, 0).\nThis is also a valid path.\n\n**Comparison:**\nPath A (DOWN): (5, 1) -> (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0) ...\nPath B (RIGHT): (5, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (6, 0) -> (5, 0) ...\n\nPath A gets the apple at (5, 0) immediately.\nPath B gets the apple at (6, 1) immediately, then can get (5, 0) later.\nBoth paths yield 2 apples in 2 turns (assuming I eat (5, 0) eventually).\nHowever, Path A keeps me slightly more contained in the left/center. Path B moves me right.\nThe enemy is at x=3. Moving right (to x=6) moves me away from the enemy.\nMoving down (to x=5) keeps me closer to the enemy (distance 5 vs 6).\nBut the enemy is at y=3. I am going to y=0.\nThe vertical distance is increasing.\nSo safety is not a major differentiator here.\n\nLet's consider the \"trap\" aspect.\nThe user's rationale warned: \"I need to be careful not to move left or right immediately after eating if it creates a trap\".\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 0) and eat:\nMy body is (5, 1), (5, 2).\nNext turn at (5, 0). If I go LEFT to (4, 0):\nBody: (5, 0), (5, 1).\nNext turn at (4, 0). If I go UP to (4, 1):\nBody: (4, 0), (5, 0).\nIf I go UP again to (4, 2):\nBody: (4, 1), (4, 0).\nThis seems fine.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 1):\nBody: (5, 1), (5, 2).\nNext turn at (6, 1). If I go DOWN to (6, 0):\nBody: (6, 1), (5, 1).\nNext turn at (6, 0). If I go LEFT to (5, 0):\nBody: (6, 0), (6, 1).\nThis also seems fine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth moves are safe and lead to scoring.\nHowever, the user's explicit plan in the last rationale was to go DOWN to (5, 0).\n\"The next apple is at (5, 0). I should continue DOWN to (5, 0) if safe.\"\nThis suggests that the user (who is me in the previous turn) saw this as the optimal continuation.\nFollowing the plan is usually better than deviating without strong cause.\nAlso, moving DOWN keeps the snake vertical, which is often easier to manage in tight spaces (though not an issue here).\nMoving RIGHT might require a turn to the left later to get the apple at (5, 0), whereas moving DOWN gets it immediately.\nGetting the apple immediately increases the score faster and grows the snake earlier, which is generally beneficial.\n\nI will stick to the plan and go DOWN.\n\n**Final Check:**\nMove: DOWN to (5, 0).\nIs it on board? Yes.\nIs it occupied by my body? No.\nIs it occupied by enemy body? No.\nIs it a head-on collision risk? Enemy is at (3, 3). Distance is large.\n\nMove: DOWN.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 0) to eat the apple. The next turn, I will likely move LEFT to (4, 0) to eat another apple on the bottom row, or RIGHT to (6, 0) if the left path is blocked (though it isn't currently). I must monitor the enemy snake's movement towards the center.\n\nDOWN",

There is an apple at (5, 0) directly below me.\n2.  **Safety Check**: Moving DOWN to (5, 0) is safe. It is on the board, not occupied by my body, and the enemy snake is too far away to collide (head at (1, 3) is distance 4+ away).\n3.  **Objective**: I need to eat apples to win. I have 2 apples, enemy has 1. Eating is a priority. (5, 0) is a guaranteed point.\n4.  **Long-term Strategy**: Following the momentum from the last turn (which moved DOWN to (5, 1)), continuing DOWN to (5, 0) secures an apple and positions me at the bottom edge. From (5, 0), I will have safe moves to LEFT (4, 0) to eat another apple or RIGHT (6, 0) to re-center.\n\n**Decision**:\n-   **DOWN** is safe and scores a point.\n-   **RIGHT** to (6, 1) is also safe (eats an apple) and keeps me slightly more central, but deviates from the direct path established in the previous turn.\n-   **LEFT** to (4, 1) is safe but does not eat an apple.\n-   **UP** to (5, 2) is fatal (into my own body).\n\nGiven that DOWN follows the plan to consume the apple at (5, 0) and remains safe (the enemy snake #0 at (1, 3) cannot reach me in one turn), it is the optimal move. Staying on the bottom row allows for potential chaining of apples (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0)...\n\nDOWN",
