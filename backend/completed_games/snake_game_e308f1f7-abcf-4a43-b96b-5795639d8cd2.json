The move to (5, 4) keeps me in a safe area away from the enemy snake at (4, 8).\n- Continuing to gather apples is a priority, as they will increase my points and help me grow, which is crucial for later stages of the game.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT to (5, 4) seems to be the best strategy. It keeps me away from danger while putting me in position to collect an apple on my next turn if the scenario allows.\n\nNext move: **LEFT**."

This places a threat around the left side of the board. Approaching that area (like moving left towards (1, 7)) could lead to confrontation.\n\n### Possible Moves from (4, 6) after left move:\n1. **UP to (4, 7)**: Moving up returns to my previous position, which is not an effective move and brings me into a loop.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 5)**: This cell is unoccupied, but doesn't seem to lead to anything beneficial.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 6)**: This cell is open and gives me options for future moves.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 6)**: This cell is also free and moves me further into unoccupied territory on the right.\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\n- **Moving UP**: Not an option since it results in going backwards.\n- **DOWN to (4, 5)**: Although it's legal, it doesn't provide opportunities towards apples or improvement of positions.\n- **LEFT to (3, 6)**: This movement could be beneficial in creating a path back toward potential apples later and maintaining distance from the enemy.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 6)**: This option introduces possibilities on the right side of the board, where fewer enemies seem to lie, but it pushes me away from the left where there are some apples. \n\n### Risk Assessment:\nWith the enemy positioned at (1, 5), staying away from their area is critical. Directly moving towards the enemy provides a risk of entrapment. I need to balance movement options with potential apple collection while ensuring safety. \n\n### Decision:\nConsidering my options, I can see that:\n- Moving LEFT to (3, 6) positions me toward the unexplored areas and can later connect to other apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 6) could open a more favorable area but risks proximity to walls and hinder future navigation.\n  \nGiven the situation, I choose to move **LEFT to (3, 6)** as it provides the most strategic advancement while minimizing risk from the enemy.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT.**"

Looking at the board state, I need to evaluate my next move based on potential apple collection and safety.\n\n### Current Move Options\n1. **UP to (6, 2)**: This move is valid and keeps me centrally located. However, it does not approach any apples directly.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 0)**: This is also a valid move but takes me closer to the edge of the board, which could potentially limit future movement options.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 1)**: Invalid due to collision with my own body.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 1)**: Valid move, keeping me clear of immediate danger, but again moving me horizontally without approaching apples.\n\n### Evaluating Options\nThe apples at (0, 1) and (1, 2) are positioned leftward, while (5, 8) and (8, 4) are upward and to the right. The apple at (8, 4) is directly within reach by moving up and to the right, while I can also consider maneuvering towards the others.\n\n#### Considerations:\n- My body is on (5, 1) and I want to avoid colliding with myself.\n- Going up may provide options later on to approach the apple at (5, 8), especially as it opens up vertical movement options.\n- Moving left is risky due to the presence of my body, while moving right does not lead directly to a target apple.\n\n### Strategic Consideration\nWhile the potential moves do not directly open up apple-access, each one sets up future moves strategically. I should keep moving in a way that allows me to approach apples while remaining safe from collisions.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven these evaluations and strategies, I'll opt to move UP to (6, 2). This will allow for future vertical movements and maintain flexibility for approaching other apples.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

Moving LEFT to (5, 2) aligns me better with further opportunities without risking immediate failure.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the evaluation of moves, I will move LEFT to (5, 2), as it provides an opportunity to navigate towards the apple at (1, 2) while avoiding immediate threats.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

(1, 2)\n3. (8, 4)\n4. (3, 1)\n5. (6, 0)\n\n### Potential Moves\n1. **UP to (4, 2)**: This position is valid and free. It moves me closer to the apple at (1, 2) through future upward movements.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 0)**: This position is valid and free but does not lead to any immediate apple and keeps me low on the board.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 1)**: This position is valid and free, leading directly to an apple located at (3, 1). It also allows me to grow and gain 1 point.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 1)**: This position is invalid as it leads back onto my own body.\n\n### Evaluating Options\n- **UP (4, 2)**: This is valid and keeps options open for future moves but does not lead directly to an apple.\n- **DOWN (4, 0)**: While valid, it takes me farther away from my targets.\n- **LEFT (3, 1)**: This move is the strongest since it directly leads to an apple, allowing me to grow and gain a point.\n- **RIGHT (5, 1)**: Invalid as it would land on my own body.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\nGiven that moving left (to (3, 1)) directly allows me to consume an apple, this is the most advantageous move and should increase my capacity for growth while also gaining 1 point. After consuming the apple, I will need to consider further movements to maximize my position without getting cornered.\n\n### Decided Next Move\nAfter analyzing my potential moves, I am going to move **LEFT** to (3, 1) to consume the apple and grow."

My current position is (3, 2) and my snake's body is currently at [(3, 1), (4, 1)], having just consumed an apple.\n\n### Available Apples and Strategic Goals\nThe available apples still on the board are:\n1. (0, 1)\n2. (1, 2) \u2014 immediately above my current position (could consume this next).\n3. (8, 4)\n4. (6, 0)\n\n### Current Board Dynamics\n- My proximity to the apple at (1, 2) is noteworthy since it's just a move away diagonally (UP and LEFT). However, I must ensure that the path is not blocked and there's enough space to maneuver away from any potential collisions.\n- There\u2019s also an enemy snake (ID 0) located at (8, 5) with its body occupying several squares in the upper right corner of the board. I don\u2019t see any immediate threats close to my current position given the available coordinates.\n\n### Potential Moves Analysis\n1. **UP to (3, 3)**: This position remains open and progresses vertically, which lets me explore more strategic placement on the board.\n2. **DOWN to (3, 1)**: This would lead me back into my own body segment, which is not an option.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 2)**: This is valid but again it does not directly move towards the available apples and adds complexity without gain.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 2)**: This is also valid but doesn\u2019t immediately lead toward the closest apple.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion\nThinking through the move towards the apple at (1, 2), I can see that my move earlier to (3, 2) keeps me close to this apple. However, to consume it next (the apple at (1, 2)), I have to be in the exact position to directly grab it.\n\nTo proceed towards that goal, I will move LEFT to (2, 2). This still opens up the chance for further maneuvers next turn and keeps me engaged on the upper rows. \n\n### Decided Next Move\n**LEFT** to (2, 2)"

However, it won't bring me closer to the apples.\n2. **DOWN to (3, 2)**: This position would collide with my own snake body. Not a viable move.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 3)**: This just brings me back to where I was for no strategic gain.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 3)**: This move doesn't directly contribute towards reaching the apple either.\n\n### Immediate Goals\nGiven the goal is to reach an apple and currently the closest apple is at (1, 2), the best strategic move is to continue moving towards the apple. However, we have to be mindful of our options as moving UP seems worthwhile but not directly towards the target.\n\n### Subsequent Moves Forecasting\nIn this case, moving UP keeps the snake advancing; however, after reaching UP, I could consider more options sequentially to move LEFT and then DOWN to be in a better position to access the apple on my next turns. \n\n### Conclusion\nHence, the most optimal move considering I need to maintain some progression and not backtrack unnecessarily while keeping future moves open.\n\nI will decide on the next move:\n**UP** to (3, 4)."
