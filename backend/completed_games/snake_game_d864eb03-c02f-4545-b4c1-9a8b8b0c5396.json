I'll consider the enemy snake's possible movements and take a trajectory that avoids getting boxed in, while still allowing me to reach the central and bottom-right areas for apple picking in future turns. \n\nHere's my reasoning: By moving left, I'll aim to head roughly diagonally towards the bottom-right. This positioning could open up more possibilities for expansion in that direction. Also, it forces the enemy to react and potentially gives me more control over our relative positions. Assuming the current trajectory works out, I plan to continue east on the next turn to really start pushing towards the (3,6) apple, keeping in mind potential evasive maneuvers should the enemy strike. \n\nNext move: LEFT",

Of course, I still need to keep an eye on Snake #0, but an immediate concern isn't the collision threat right now.\n\nNext strategy to consider: As my body grows with each new apple, I'll need to balance efficient point accumulation with trajectory control to avoid risking a deadly confrontation with my rival or the walls. Maintaining a mix of short, targeted moves and longer, wormhole-making pushes will give me situational awareness and flexibility.\n\nFor now though, that RIGHT direction beckons, offering access to a higher-yield apple in a relatively safe trajectory.
