This puts me in the center of the bottom row.\n\t- Apples are at **(0, 4)**, **(8, 7)**, **(7, 3)**, **(2, 5)**, and **(2, 2)**.\n\t- There's an enemy snake at **(7, 4)**\u2014so I should be cautious of moving too close to them.\n2. **Plan Based on the Apples:**\n\t- The closest apple is at **(8, 7)**, all the way up in the top-left corner. However, moving toward it puts me in danger of bumping into the enemy snake directly to my right.\n\t- Another option is the apple at **(7, 3)**, a bit farther to my right. There's a safe path through **(6, 3)** if I avoid the enemy.\n\t- Lastly, there's an apple at **(2, 5)** slightly above me. Moving there could be risky if the enemy snake anticipates the same move.\n3. **Consider Avoiding the Enemy Snake:**\n\t- The enemy snake could get to the apple at **(7, 3)** before me, so targeting **(2, 5)** or considering a move down toward the apple at **(2, 2)** seems safer.\n4. **Consider Board Limitations:**\n\t- If I move up toward **(2, 5)**, I can still consider a diagonal path to the left toward **(2, 2)** without risking the enemy.\n5. **Deciding the Next Move:**\n\t- Given the above, I'll aim to move **UP** toward **(2, 5)**, ensuring I keep a safe path to reposition.\n\n**Next move: UP**",

This seems relatively safe but requires covering more distance.\n2. **Enemy Snake:**\n\t- The enemy snake at **(6, 4)** is moving downward.

This is the nearest and safest option, ensuring I grow while keeping clear of the enemy snake.\n\n### STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN\n\nNext turn, I\u2019ll reassess the board and consider whether the enemy snake\u2019s movements open up opportunities to grab the apple at **(8, 7)**. If not, I\u2019ll aim for the apple at **(7, 3)**, prioritizing safety over risk.\n\n**END THINKING OUT LOUD**\n\n**NEXT MOVE:** LEFT",

If the coast is clear, I\u2019ll aim for that. If not, I\u2019ll consider moving upward toward the apple at **(7, 3)**.\n\n**END THINKING OUT LOUD**\n\n**NEXT MOVE:** LEFT",

I\u2019ll avoid this path for now.\n\t- Another apple is at (8, 7). This would require moving down and then right, also bringing me closer to the enemy snake. This is too risky given the current situation.\n\t- The apple at (3, 1) is inaccessible this turn because my head is already there.\n\t- The apple at (2, 5) requires moving left and then up. It seems relatively safe, as it\u2019s away from the enemy snake and the edges.\n2. **Enemy Snake:**\n\t- The enemy snake is at (6, 3) and continues moving right.

If I make a quick move toward (7, 3), I should be able to grab the apple before it becomes a point of conflict.\n\n### PLANNED MOVE\n\nI\u2019ll move **down** to (3, 5), positioning myself to grab the apple at (7, 3) on my next turn.

Depending on the enemy snake\u2019s movement, I might either try to block its path or secure another apple nearby.\n\n--END THINKING OUT LOUD--\n\n**NEXT MOVE:** DOWN.",
