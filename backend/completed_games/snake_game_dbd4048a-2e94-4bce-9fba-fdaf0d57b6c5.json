In contrast, the apple at (5,1) is tucked in the lower part of the board and seems less contested.\n\nA promising strategy is to head LEFT. For example, if we move LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3), we\u2019re positioning ourselves with a clear path: our next moves could be to move DOWN (to (5,2)) and then DOWN again to reach the apple at (5,1).

(Recall that we executed our previous move so that we are now at (4,2).)\n\n\u2022 From (4,2) our immediate adjacent cells are:\n\u2003\u2013 UP to (4,3)\n\u2003\u2013 LEFT to (3,2)\n\u2003\u2013 RIGHT to (5,2), but that\u2019s occupied by our body\n\u2003\u2013 DOWN to (4,1), which is also part of our body\n\nThus, our safe moves are UP and LEFT.\n\n\u2022 Looking at the apple positions, note that one apple is at (4,7). Although a straight vertical run from (4,2) to (4,7) would normally be ideal, the enemy snake head is at (4,6) and its body occupies (3,6), (3,5), and (3,4). That means if we go straight up, we\u2019ll eventually run into trouble at (4,6). However, we can begin by moving UP (to (4,3)) and then, once closer, divert our path to avoid the enemy\u2019s guard.\n\nHere\u2019s a possible route if we choose UP:\n\u20031. Move from (4,2) UP to (4,3) \u2013 safe.\n\u20032. Then continue UP to (4,4) and (4,5).\n\u20033. At (4,5) we cannot go UP (because (4,6) currently holds the enemy head) or LEFT (since (3,5) is enemy body), so the plan would be to steer RIGHT into (5,5). \n\u20034. Then, from (5,5) go UP to (5,6) and (5,7) and finally move LEFT into the apple at (4,7).\n\n\u2022 Alternatively, if we moved LEFT from (4,2) heading toward the far left apples at (1,5) or (0,5), we\u2019d run into the enemy snake\u2019s body soon (remember enemy segments are at (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6) which lie along that column).\n\n\u2022 Given the options, the UP move from (4,2) (to (4,3)) is both immediately safe and sets us on a path where\u2014after a short detour\u2014we can safely approach the apple at (4,7).\n\nI\u2019ll therefore choose to move UP now.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

Although (5,5) is free, turning left afterward (to reach the apples) would force us into or near the enemy\u2019s zone (with segments at (3,5) and (4,6\u20139)).  \n\u2003\u2022 Moving RIGHT further separates us from enemy cells, but keeps us on the right half\u2014which isn\u2019t where the apples are. That extra distance would force a long-cross board run later.  \n\u2003\u2022 Moving DOWN (to (5,3)) keeps us safe and \u2013 crucially \u2013 it steers us into the lower half of the board. Down there the enemy snake isn\u2019t patrolling, and it gives us a chance to eventually swing left and approach the lower apples (like the one at (2,2) or the one at (0,1)) without immediate interference.\n\nBy choosing DOWN, we keep our options open: After moving down, we can plan a leftward turn (even if it means \u201ctail\u2010chasing\u201d a bit, which is safe in standard Snake since the tail leaves if no apple is eaten) and then work our way to a safe apple zone while avoiding the enemy\u2019s vertical block.\n\nThus, for safety and to begin an approach toward the less\u2010contested apple areas, I decide our next move should be:\n\nDOWN."

Going UP (to (0,2)) will help move us upward toward row 3\u2014the y-coordinate of apple (5,3). Although our body currently forms a line to our right, after our move the tail will be removed (if we don\u2019t eat an apple), which will help free up space for future moves. For example, if on a later turn we head UP again to (0,3), we can then safely turn RIGHT toward (5,3).\n\n\u2022 The enemy snake, with its head at (0,5) and body occupying space further up and to the right, doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat to our path if we head UP.\n\nThus, considering safety and positioning to eventually reach our nearest apple, our strategy is to use UP now. On subsequent turns, we\u2019ll work to free space from our own body and turn RIGHT when it\u2019s safe so we can approach (5,3).\n\nNext move: UP."

That cluster makes moving UP less attractive, and going RIGHT would edge me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s long contiguous body on the right (e.g. at (9,2)\u2013(9,7)). \n\nLooking at the immediate neighbors of (6,4):\n\u2022 UP \u2192 (6,5) is open but would push me toward the congested upper region of my own body.\n\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 (7,4) is open but risks funneling me near enemy parts later.\n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (6,3) is also open, and it takes me away from the dense body grouping while still leaving plenty of room to later divert (for example, I could later move to (7,3) to avoid the enemy\u2019s barrier along row 2).\n\nSince none of these moves immediately capture an apple, I want to choose the direction that preserves the largest, safest area for maneuvering. Moving DOWN to (6,3) takes me away from my own tail\u2013and it appears that the lower rows (row 0\u20133) offer more open space (even though I must later be careful to avoid enemy segments in row 2). \n\nThus, to keep my snake \u201ccentral\u201d and avoid both the self\u2010dense area above and the enemy \u201cwall\u201d on the far right, the best safe next move is to go DOWN.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

One route could be as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 From our head at (2,3), a move LEFT puts us at (1,3).\n\u2003\u2022 On the next turns we could go UP from (1,3) to (1,4),\n\u2003\u2022 then head LEFT from (1,4) into (0,4),\n\u2003\u2022 followed by UP to (0,5) and then UP once more into (0,6) where the apple is located.\n\nComparing our alternatives:\n\u2003\u2013 Moving UP first (to (2,4)) does offer several exits, but our eventual plan would still require turning LEFT. Moreover, going UP immediately risks having our own body block a more direct path.\n\u2003\u2013 By moving LEFT immediately, we directly step toward that corridor while keeping our options open and avoiding any potential trap near our own body.\n\nThus, to best position ourselves for getting more open space and eventually the apple at (0,6), I decide that our next move should be to continue going LEFT.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

          "rationale": "I'll start by double\u2010checking our options: From our head at (2,3), moving RIGHT would run into our body at (3,3) and moving DOWN would hit an occupied (2,2). That leaves UP (to (2,4)) and LEFT (to (1,3)). Since our goal is to eventually reach the apple at (0,6), entering the open corridor on the board\u2019s left side is ideal. Moving LEFT from (2,3) to (1,3) immediately heads toward that corridor; afterwards we can move UP and then further LEFT to reach (0,6).\n\nTherefore, the best move now is to go LEFT.\n\nFinal move: LEFT."
