Quick, loud, ruthless reasoning coming at you \u2014 fans want the plays and the receipts. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd25\n\nTurn 0 check \u2014 positions:\n- Me (ID 1) head = (9,6)\n- Enemy (ID 0) head = (6,4)\n- No bodies for either (length-1 snakes). Apples exist but we\u2019re focusing on boxing the foe.\n\nDecision process (thinking out loud):\n1) Consider all four moves from (9,6):\n   - UP \u2192 (9,7): safe. Keeps space but pushes toward the top edge a bit; still okay.\n   - DOWN \u2192 (9,5): safe. Closes vertical gap to the enemy (y from 6\u21925 vs enemy y=4). Could be more committed downward.\n   - LEFT \u2192 (8,6): safe. Moves us closer on the x-axis toward the enemy (x 9\u21928). Keeps lots of escape/pressure options.\n   - RIGHT \u2192 (10,6): OUT OF BOUNDS \u2192 immediate death. Never an option. \u274c\n\n2) Eliminate deadly moves: RIGHT is dead. All others are safe this turn \u2014 no immediate head-on possible (enemy can only reach (5,4),(7,4),(6,5),(6,3) this turn; none overlap our adjacents).\n\n3) Among safe moves, prefer the one that keeps multiple follow-ups available while starting to compress the opponent:\n   - UP would slowly drift away vertically and might limit upward room later.\n   - DOWN gets closer in y but corners us to the far right edge sooner.\n   - LEFT gives horizontal pressure toward the opponent, keeps vertical freedom, and is the most flexible for next-turn options to cut off or pivot. It also starts to take space on the right side so we can shepherd them leftwards.\n\nRISK/COLLISION NOTE: With both snakes length 1, head-on ties are possible later \u2014 but not this turn. We should avoid walks into potential 1-step mutual collisions unless we\u2019re ahead on apples (we\u2019re tied 0\u20130), so prioritize safe pressure.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns (this will be the \u201clast rationale\u201d next round):\n- Move LEFT now to (8,6), then evaluate enemy reaction.\n- If enemy drifts left or up, use vertical moves to trap (pivot DOWN to align y with them and then push left to cut their escape).\n- Avoid chasing isolated apples alone; grow only when it helps dominate space. Force a head-on only when we have apple/length advantage or can ensure opponent has fewer escape cells.\n\nFinal move \u2014 keep pressure, keep options, get closer on the x-axis: we go LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

WE'RE UP 1-0 BABY! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF**: After eating at (7,4), we'll be length 2 with head at (7,4) and tail at (6,4). Next priorities: grab (7,2) or (8,0) to keep growing, or start cutting off lanes to trap the enemy against the right wall since they're already cornered at x=9.

Their legal moves this turn: UP \u2192 (7,5), RIGHT \u2192 (8,4), DOWN \u2192 (7,3).\n\nConsider moves from (8,6):\n- UP \u2192 (8,7): safe, keeps space but drifts away; less pressure.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5): safe now, but moving toward an adjacent square (7,5) next turn could let the opponent suicide-head-on into it if we try to trap there (we\u2019re behind on apples \u2014 we don\u2019t want a mutual kill).\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6): safe and aggressive. Pushes horizontally toward the enemy, keeps vertical escape room, and doesn\u2019t hand them an immediate head-on kill option.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6): safe but hugs the wall and reduces options.\n\nRisk checks:\n- No immediate head-on on any of the four choices this turn.\n- Because the opponent leads 1\u20130, we should avoid intentionally creating a one-turn mutual collision possibility that they can exploit. That rules out risky plays that land us directly into a cell opponent can move into the same turn to force a double KO later.\n\nPlan (short-term / next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to start compressing the enemy from the right side.\n- Next turn read their reaction: if they retreat or move down, pivot down to match y and then cut left to hem them into their own body/wall. If they try to push up into more space, follow vertically to close the gap.\n- Don\u2019t chase apples blindly \u2014 only take one if it gives us the length advantage to safely force a head-on.

It\u2019s legal because moves are simultaneous, but it\u2019s a direct confrontation that narrows options and could lead to a risky head-swap or a quick boxing scenario. Since we\u2019re behind on apples (0\u20131), we should avoid forcing mutual collisions unless we can guarantee the trade favors us.\n- LEFT (6,5): safe and keeps distance horizontally, but drifts away from controlling the opponent\u2019s escape routes.\n- DOWN (7,4): would chase downward and continue pressure \u2014 also safe \u2014 but pushes us toward the opponent\u2019s neck-row and could reduce vertical options.\n- UP (7,6): keeps maximum flexibility. It avoids immediate head-on pressure, keeps three escape/follow-up options next turn, and doesn\u2019t hand the opponent an easy forced collision. We maintain aggression potential without gambling our life for no apple advantage.\n\nOpponent branches:\n- If they go LEFT into our current square (7,5), that\u2019s just a swap possibility if we move into their current square \u2014 could be messy. If we instead move UP we avoid being baited into straight trades.\n- If they go RIGHT to the wall at (9,5) or UP to (8,6), moving UP keeps us well-positioned to pivot and start hemming them in on the next 1\u20132 turns without taking a dumb double-KO risk.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Play UP now to preserve options.\n- If they retreat or go toward the wall, pivot horizontally to cut exits while avoiding a head-on unless we can secure an apple advantage.\n- If they try to bait a swap, refuse the trade \u2014 keep flanking pressure and force them into a trap or into chasing an apple that leaves them exposed.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the heat on but not throw our life away.

Best mix of aggression + safety.\n\nOpponent likely plays UP (to chase), LEFT, or DOWN. We must refuse the double-KO \u2014 let them take the gamble.

If they chase UP into our previous square, we can sidestep and push toward boxing them against the right wall or funnel them into apples when it's safe to grow.\n- Avoid moving directly into their head while behind on apples.

We're sitting pretty at (6,7) with that juicy 1-0 lead, and our RIVAL is quaking in their boots at (6,8)! They're LITERALLY one cell above us, shaking because they know we got the SCORE ADVANTAGE! Any head-on collision means WE TAKE THE DUB! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc80\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS - WHERE'S THE CONTENT AT? \ud83c\udfaf**\n\n**DOWN to (6,6)?** BRUH, are we running away?! That's showing weakness! That's giving them the high ground to snatch that (5,8) apple uncontested! We're not cowards, are we chat?! NO! \u274c\ud83d\udc14\n\n**LEFT to (5,7)?** Okay, okay, it's safe, and yeah there's that (4,7) apple looking tasty... BUT WAIT! If we move left, that CLOWN could snatch the (5,8) apple, GROW, and suddenly we got a longer snake to deal with! We letting them get bigger? HELL NO! \ud83d\udeab\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**RIGHT to (7,7)?** That's literally moving BACKWARDS into our own tail! Instant death! Self-report! Not happening! \ud83d\udc80\u26b0\ufe0f\n\n**UP to (6,8)?** OH MY GOODNESS, NOW WE'RE COOKING! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\n- We move RIGHT INTO THEIR FACE! We take their current spot and FORCE them to make a decision under pressure!\n- If they panic and try to move DOWN to (6,7)? We SWAP positions and now we're the ones controlling the vertical! We're the aggressor, they're reacting to US! \ud83d\ude24\n- If they flee UP to (6,9)? We follow them to the WALL! We're herding them toward that top edge where options are LIMITED! \ud83e\uddf1\n- If they run LEFT to (5,8)? We cut off their escape route to the center next turn!\n- If they run RIGHT to (7,8)? We can pivot to cut them off or contest that (7,9) apple!\n\nThis is about DOMINANCE! We're up 1-0, so we're playing BULLY SNAKE! We take up space, we breathe down their necks, we make them feel the HEAT! \ud83e\udd4a\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We just moved UP to (6,8), staring down our rival! Next turn, we keep the pressure on! If they fled UP to (6,9), we FOLLOW to (6,9) and trap them against that top wall! If they went LEFT to (5,8), we move LEFT to (5,8) and force a head-to-head! Remember: we have the apple advantage, so ANY collision is a WIN FOR US! Let's box them in and make them CRASH OUT! \ud83e\udd47\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",
