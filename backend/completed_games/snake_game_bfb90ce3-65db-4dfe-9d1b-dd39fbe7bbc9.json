This puts me directly above the apple at (1, 0), and then I can move DOWN twice to collect it. This is the most efficient path.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT to (1, 2), I should move DOWN to (1, 1), then DOWN again to (1, 0) to collect the apple. Keep monitoring the enemy snake to ensure it doesn't interfere with my path.\n\nLEFT"

Directly below my current path after moving UP.\n\n**Enemy Snake (#0) Information:**\n- **Head at (2, 2):** Still in a central position but should not pose an immediate threat in its current trajectory.\n\n### New Considerations and Strategy:\n\n1. **Immediate Goals:**\n   - Now that the apple at (0, 5) is consumed, consider targeting the apple at (1, 0), which requires moving vertically down after this move if possible, keeping caution against the snake body overlap.\n   \n2. **Move Safety:**\n   - **UP to (1, 6):** A valid move considering the current safe path without nearing any immediate danger. This also helps clear immediate threats and gives time to decide which apple to target next. \n   - **LEFT to (0, 5):** Steps away from the current body and is safe from immediate threats.\n   - **RIGHT to (2, 5):** Engages with Snake #0 territory soon, and could increase risk.\n   - **DOWN to (1, 4):** Directly back into my own body, leading to self-collision.\n\n3. **Risk Management:**\n   - Continue monitoring Snake #0. If moving UP opens additional paths without nearing risks, it also gives time to strategize for the next apple capture. As Snake #0 is still away, maintaining current board awareness is key.\n\n4. **Recommended Move and Strategy:**\n   - Move **UP** to (1, 6) to maintain tactical positioning and consider future targeting towards the apples at boundaries. Post this move, reassess which apple is closest and most strategic to aim for next, while staying cautious of Snake #0's potential movement.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nMoving UP to (1, 6) will position the snake advantageously, securing safety while further assessing the map and enemy positions. This approach ensures a balance between offense (apple targeting) and defense (position safety).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:** After securing safety in the next higher row, explore opportunities that align with reaching another apple, but with a strong focus on minimizing potential collision risks. Monitor Snake #0's trajectory to decide if staying in high rows is essential or if there is a clear path moving down.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**"

I successfully collected the apple that was at (1, 0) and grew by one segment.\n\nLooking at the board, the remaining apples are at:\n- (0, 9) - far top left corner\n- (0, 5) - left side middle  \n- (8, 0) - bottom right corner\n- (9, 9) - far top right corner\n- (4, 6) - center area\n\nEnemy snake (ID: 1) is at position (1, 8) with body at [(1, 7)]. It's still far away and moving in the upper area.\n\nFrom my current position (1, 0), let me check my movement options:\n- UP: Would move to (1, 1) - BLOCKED! This is where my body segment is\n- DOWN: Would move to (1, -1) - OUT OF BOUNDS! This would kill me\n- LEFT: Would move to (0, 0) - Safe! This gets me to the left edge\n- RIGHT: Would move to (2, 0) - Safe! This moves me along the bottom edge\n\nSince I'm at the bottom edge of the board (y=0), I can't go DOWN. Going UP would hit my own body. So my safe options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nStrategy consideration: The apple at (0, 5) is relatively close and I could work my way up the left side of the board to get it. The apple at (8, 0) is along the bottom edge but much further away. The apple at (4, 6) is in a more central location.\n\nGoing LEFT to (0, 0) puts me in the corner, which could be risky for future movement, but it also positions me to eventually go up the left side toward the (0, 5) apple.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (2, 0) keeps me along the bottom edge and could set me up for either the (8, 0) apple or I could turn upward later.\n\nI think LEFT is the better choice here because:\n1. It positions me for the (0, 5) apple which is closer than (8, 0)\n2. The enemy snake is in the upper middle area, so staying on the left side might avoid conflict\n3. After reaching (0, 0), I can start moving UP along the left wall\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT to (0, 0), I'll be in the bottom-left corner. From there, I should move UP to start working toward the apple at (0, 5). The left wall will provide a clear path upward.\n\nLEFT"

I successfully collected the apple that was at (1, 0) and grew by one segment.\n\nLooking at the board, the remaining apples are at:\n- (0, 9) - far top left corner\n- (0, 5) - left side middle  \n- (8, 0) - bottom right corner\n- (9, 9) - far top right corner\n- (4, 6) - center area\n\nEnemy snake (ID: 1) is at position (1, 8) with body at [(1, 7)]. It's still far away and moving in the upper area.\n\nFrom my current position (1, 0), let me check my movement options:\n- UP: Would move to (1, 1) - BLOCKED! This is where my body segment is\n- DOWN: Would move to (1, -1) - OUT OF BOUNDS! This would kill me\n- LEFT: Would move to (0, 0) - Safe! This gets me to the left edge\n- RIGHT: Would move to (2, 0) - Safe! This moves me along the bottom edge\n\nSince I'm at the bottom edge of the board (y=0), I can't go DOWN. Going UP would hit my own body. So my safe options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nStrategy consideration: The apple at (0, 5) is relatively close and I could work my way up the left side of the board to get it. The apple at (8, 0) is along the bottom edge but much further away. The apple at (4, 6) is in a more central location.\n\nGoing LEFT to (0, 0) puts me in the corner, which could be risky for future movement, but it also positions me to eventually go up the left side toward the (0, 5) apple.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (2, 0) keeps me along the bottom edge and could set me up for either the (8, 0) apple or I could turn upward later.\n\nI think LEFT is the better choice here because:\n1. It positions me for the (0, 5) apple which is closer than (8, 0)\n2. The enemy snake is in the upper middle area, so staying on the left side might avoid conflict\n3. After reaching (0, 0), I can start moving UP along the left wall\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT to (0, 0), I'll be in the bottom-left corner.

This puts me directly above the apple at (1, 0), and then I can move DOWN twice to collect it. This is the most efficient path.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT to (1, 2), I should move DOWN to (1, 1), then DOWN again to (1, 0) to collect the apple. Keep monitoring the enemy snake to ensure it doesn't interfere with my path.\n\nLEFT"

This also helps clear immediate threats and gives time to decide which apple to target next. \n   - **LEFT to (0, 5):** Steps away from the current body and is safe from immediate threats.\n   - **RIGHT to (2, 5):** Engages with Snake #0 territory soon, and could increase risk.\n   - **DOWN to (1, 4):** Directly back into my own body, leading to self-collision.\n\n3. **Risk Management:**\n   - Continue monitoring Snake #0. If moving UP opens additional paths without nearing risks, it also gives time to strategize for the next apple capture. As Snake #0 is still away, maintaining current board awareness is key.\n\n4. **Recommended Move and Strategy:**\n   - Move **UP** to (1, 6) to maintain tactical positioning and consider future targeting towards the apples at boundaries. Post this move, reassess which apple is closest and most strategic to aim for next, while staying cautious of Snake #0's potential movement.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nMoving UP to (1, 6) will position the snake advantageously, securing safety while further assessing the map and enemy positions. This approach ensures a balance between offense (apple targeting) and defense (position safety).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:** After securing safety in the next higher row, explore opportunities that align with reaching another apple, but with a strong focus on minimizing potential collision risks.

The apple at (0, 5) on the left side might be a good target since it's not too far and I can approach it safely. I'll need to be careful not to box myself in as I grow larger.\n\nDOWN"

A viable immediate move.\n   - **LEFT to (0, 8):** Initiates the trajectory toward apple (0, 9). This is also a safe path without immediate threats.\n   - **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Moves us unnecessarily towards Snake #0's previous trail; not desirable.\n   - **DOWN to (1, 7):** Not viable as it results in collision with my own body.\n\n3. **Risk Management:**\n   - Remain vigilant of Snake #0\u2019s position; maintain a readiness to adjust strategy if it shifts its course toward our territory.\n   - Avoid isolation in the top left that might constrain future options.\n\n4. **Recommended Strategy for Next Turns:**\n   - This turn, focus on leveraging the board's leftward edge towards the apple (0, 9). \n   - Once we reach (0, 9), reassess Apple positions and movement patterns of Snake #0 for further strategies, potentially pivot back toward the center depending on board dynamics.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT to (0, 8) initiates a direct path toward (0, 9), maintaining safe board navigation and offering optimal progression toward scoring the apple with minimal immediate threats. Engage in consistent monitoring to ensure versatile movement and readiness for rapid adaptations.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

I successfully collected the apple that was at (1, 0) and grew by one segment.\n\nLooking at the board, the remaining apples are at:\n- (0, 9) - far top left corner\n- (0, 5) - left side middle  \n- (8, 0) - bottom right corner\n- (9, 9) - far top right corner\n- (4, 6) - center area\n\nEnemy snake (ID: 1) is at position (1, 8) with body at [(1, 7)]. It's still far away and moving in the upper area.\n\nFrom my current position (1, 0), let me check my movement options:\n- UP: Would move to (1, 1) - BLOCKED! This is where my body segment is\n- DOWN: Would move to (1, -1) - OUT OF BOUNDS! This would kill me\n- LEFT: Would move to (0, 0) - Safe! This gets me to the left edge\n- RIGHT: Would move to (2, 0) - Safe! This moves me along the bottom edge\n\nSince I'm at the bottom edge of the board (y=0), I can't go DOWN. Going UP would hit my own body. So my safe options are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nStrategy consideration: The apple at (0, 5) is relatively close and I could work my way up the left side of the board to get it. The apple at (8, 0) is along the bottom edge but much further away. The apple at (4, 6) is in a more central location.\n\nGoing LEFT to (0, 0) puts me in the corner, which could be risky for future movement, but it also positions me to eventually go up the left side toward the (0, 5) apple.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (2, 0) keeps me along the bottom edge and could set me up for either the (8, 0) apple or I could turn upward later.\n\nI think LEFT is the better choice here because:\n1. It positions me for the (0, 5) apple which is closer than (8, 0)\n2. The enemy snake is in the upper middle area, so staying on the left side might avoid conflict\n3. After reaching (0, 0), I can start moving UP along the left wall\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT to (0, 0), I'll be in the bottom-left corner. From there, I should move UP to start working toward the apple at (0, 5). The left wall will provide a clear path upward.\n\nLEFT"
