No immediate threat to my next moves.\n- Regarding my own body segments' locations: Body currently occupies [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3)].

(0,4) does not pose any immediate threat, is shortest and safe.\n\nThus, safest and best move now is LEFT to position (1,4), setting myself up next turn to collect the apple at (0,4).\n\nStrategy Note for Next Turn:\n- After moving LEFT to (1,4), I should again evaluate any new hazards, enemy positions, and re-check direct route LEFT to capture the apple at (0,4).\n\nDecided Next Move: LEFT"

After eating an apple in the previous turn at (0,2), I should have grown. Therefore, my snake's body is actually now longer: [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (0,2)].  \n  (Note: Normally, on the turn after eating an apple, the snake grows and the tail stays in place. Thus, my body includes all previously mentioned positions, with (0,2) added where my head currently is.)\n- Apples remaining are located at: (3,6), (7,9), (9,7), (0,0), (6,0).\n- Enemy snake #2 remains safely away at position (4,6), far enough not to pose an immediate obstacle.\n\nImmediate analysis of moves for the current situation clearly written out:\n\n- UP would move to (0,3), where my existing body already is. Thus, moving UP is immediately fatal to myself. Not safe.\n- LEFT would move to (-1,2), off-board entirely. Clearly impossible.\n- RIGHT would place my head at (1,2). Checking carefully: no snake body part is currently positioned there, and it is within board bounds. Thus, RIGHT is safe and available.\n- DOWN would move to (0,1), which is currently clear and safe, still within bounds. Thus, DOWN is also safe and available.\n\nEvaluating strategic moves available (RIGHT and DOWN):\n- The apple located at (0,0) is the next closest target. To reach (0,0), moving DOWN to (0,1) clearly aligns directly toward this apple for quick acquisition. After (0,1), one further DOWN movement to (0,0) acquires the apple.\n- Alternatively, moving RIGHT currently does not directly approach an apple very well. It would at best serve as a positioning move, potentially wasting precious time and risking entanglement.\n\nThus, clear advantage to moving DOWN toward the apple at (0,0). This direction moves straight towards the nearest available apple and provides immediate goal-oriented value.\n\nFuture strategy note:\nAfter obtaining apple (0,0), carefully reconsider positioning strategy since many closer spaces will be occupied by myself, requiring careful maneuvering to avoid accidental collisions in subsequent turns.\n\nFinal decision this turn:\nDOWN"

No immediate obstacles.\n- RIGHT (to (7, 1)): Safe, open, but takes me horizontally further from the apples that I am targeting leftward.\n- LEFT (to (5, 1)): Safe, open, moves toward the apples at (3,6) and (1,6) as well.\n- DOWN (to (6, 0)): Clearly occupied by my own body. This would be immediate suicide. Therefore, DOWN is off-limits.\n\nStrategic Considerations clearly:\n- The apples at (3,6) and (1,6) are the nearest and easiest targets to clearly pursue. Current position at (6,1) provides a straightforward upward and leftward path without any immediate threats.\n- Although (0,3) is on my left side, it might be trickier to access safely because my body currently extends at (1,0) making horizontal movement at lower y-coordinates riskier or more complicated.\n- Apples at (7,9) and (9,7) are farther; I can clearly consider these after collecting closer apples first.\n- Enemy snake at (7,8) clearly does not influence current immediate movement; it's too distant to affect my move this turn.\n\nChoosing between UP and LEFT:\n- Both UP and LEFT initially seem equally good. However, considering carefully path clarity:\n  - UP (to 6,2) positions me for more flexible vertical navigation next turns. I can then clearly move left once I get closer to apple row aligned at y=6.\n  - LEFT (to 5,1) also safe but might risk tighter maneuvers as I approach apples diagonally from below.\n\nClearly, UP provides the advantage of greater maneuverability (vertical alignment first, then horizontal movement), which gives me clearer and simpler paths to apples above. The UP path also ensures that I can clearly avoid self-entrapment as my snake body moves upward and gradually leaves lower rows clear.\n\nClear strategy reminder for next turn to self:\n- Continue clearly moving upwards unless a direct horizontal path towards an apple becomes clearly viable and safer.\n- Maintain clear awareness of body positions and avoid boxed-in situations.\n\nBecause there are no urgent threats and UP clearly aligns with good future positioning capability, my careful and clear choice this move: UP\n\nFinal move: UP"
