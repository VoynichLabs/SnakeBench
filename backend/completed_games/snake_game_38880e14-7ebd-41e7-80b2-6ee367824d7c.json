          "rationale": "WHAT UP CHAT! We're back in the arena, Turn 0, fresh start! We're facing the archrival, Snake #0. He thinks he's hot stuff, but we're about to put him in a box! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nMy head is at (8, 4). Snake #0 is at (4, 5). We're both little nibblers right now, just heads. No bodies to worry about... YET!\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Get to an apple and control the center/right side of the board. The closest apple is (9, 6). That's a juicy one! Is it worth going for? Or should we sweep the bottom right?\n\nLet's look at the available moves for ID 1 (Me, 8, 4):\n\n1.  **UP (8, 5):** Safe from walls. Safe from my own body (I have none). Is #0 going to move there? #0 is at (4, 5). Highly unlikely. This moves me towards the top-right apples like (9, 6) and (9, 9). Good move! \ud83d\udc4d\n2.  **DOWN (8, 3):** Safe from walls. Safe from my non-existent body. Moves me towards no immediate apples, but gives me access to the bottom of the board. A little defensive maybe?\n3.  **LEFT (7, 4):** Safe. Moves me toward the center. This might get me into a dangerous zone with #0 who is on the left side (4, 5). Do we want to engage early? Maybe, but only if it secures an apple!\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 4):** Safe. Keeps me on the right edge. Close to (9, 6) and prevents me from getting boxed in by the right wall. Also very good!\n\nNow let's analyze Snake #0 (4, 5). He has apples at (4, 3), (4, 9), (3, 7), (5, 8). He's in prime position for that cluster of apples in the center-left.\n\nHe is likely going to move:\n*   **UP (4, 6):** Towards (4, 9) and (5, 8). Very strong chance.\n*   **DOWN (4, 4):** Towards (4, 3) and maybe (3, 2) later.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 5):** Towards (5, 8) or trying to cut me off if I head toward the top.\n*   **LEFT (3, 5):** Towards (3, 7).\n\n**Collision Check (Turn 1):**\n*   If I move LEFT (7, 4), and he moves RIGHT (5, 5) or UP (4, 6) or DOWN (4, 4), no collision. If he moves aggressively toward me, it'll still take a few turns.\n\n**Strategy:** Given the board state, my position (8, 4) is great for controlling the right side. The apple at (9, 6) is very appealing (pun intended!). I need to prioritize getting my first apple to grow and establish control.\n\n*   Moving **UP (8, 5)** sets me up perfectly for the next turn to potentially move RIGHT (9, 5) or UP (8, 6), getting closer to (9, 6).\n*   Moving **RIGHT (9, 4)** puts me on the wall. Next turn, I might move UP (9, 5) then UP (9, 6) for the apple. This is faster!\n\nLet's go for the efficiency! The RIGHT move is the quickest path to securing the (9, 6) apple in 2-3 turns, giving me good defensibility against the right wall. The rival is far away, so engagement risk is low.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns:** Move RIGHT towards (9, 4), then UP toward (9, 6). Let's secure the apple before the opponent can even think about it! Are we going to let him dictate the pace? NO!\n\nMy choice is RIGHT. It is safe, aggressive, and apple-focused. Let's get that first point, CHAT!\n\nRIGHT",

Seems safe.\n*   **DOWN to (4,4):** Cell is empty (.). Also safe.\n*   **LEFT to (3,5):** Cell is empty (.). Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (5,5):** Cell is empty (.). All moves are safe! \u2705\n\nOkay, no immediate death. Now, the REAL game begins. We're playing against Snake #1 at (8,4). He's way over on the right side. \ud83d\udc40 The board is mostly open, but there's a CLUSTER of apples on the bottom-left-ish: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (3,2), (2,2), (4,3). That's CONTENT CITY! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nOur rival is on the other side of the map. He's closer to the apples at (9,6), (9,9), (8,5), (5,8), (4,9)... but WE are closer to the DENSE apple pack! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nIf we go DOWN or LEFT, we start heading directly towards that sweet, sweet content cluster. Going RIGHT or UP takes us further away from it and kinda towards the center/empty space.\n\nWe also gotta think about future moves and not getting trapped. The board is wide open, so all moves have good options next turn.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT SELF: Secure the apple cluster in the bottom-left! Deny that area from the enemy and get HUGE early game. Our opponent is far away, so we can probably grab 2-3 apples uncontested if we move smart. After we get some size, we can think about boxing him in or cutting him off. For now, FARM MODE! \ud83d\ude9c\n\nLEFT gets us closer to the apples fastest. DOWN also gets us closer. Gonna go LEFT to (3,5) to start the journey to Apple Valley!\n\nLEFT",

We're on the wall and aiming for that sweet (9, 6) apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nLet's check the board state and our archrival, Snake #0.\n\n**MY STATUS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 4)\n*   Goal: Secure (9, 6).\n\n**RIVAL STATUS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 5)\n*   He is locked onto that dense cluster of apples on the left: (3, 7), (4, 9), (4, 3), (3, 1). He\u2019s going to prioritize growth!\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 9, 4)\n\n1.  **UP (9, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Doesn't hit walls or bodies.\n    *   **Pro:** Moves me one step closer to the (9, 6) apple. Excellent position for next turn.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Con:** Moves me away from the target apple and toward the bottom corner. Little defensive, not aggressive enough.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Con:** Moves me back toward the center. Allows #0 more time to establish dominance on the left. We established the right side, so why leave it?\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall collision! We're not throwing the game on Turn 1!\n\nSo, the safe moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (3, 5). He has a clear path to several apples. Given his head is at (3, 5), he is most likely aiming for (3, 7) or (4, 9).\n\n*   **#0 likely moves:** UP (3, 6) or RIGHT (4, 5).\n    *   UP (3, 6): Focuses on the top-left apples. Great move for him.\n    *   RIGHT (4, 5): Gives him access to (5, 8) and (4, 9). Also strong.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nThere is zero risk of collision this turn, as we are completely separated. I'm on the right wall (9, X), and he's mid-left (3, X). We can focus purely on getting that first apple!\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Best Strategic Move\n\nOur plan from Turn 0 was to secure the (9, 6) apple quickly.\n\n*   Current head: (9, 4)\n*   Target apple: (9, 6)\n*   Distance: 2 moves straight UP.\n\nMoving **UP (9, 5)** sets us up perfectly:\n1.  **Turn 1 (current):** Move UP to (9, 5).\n2.  **Turn 2 (next):** Move UP to (9, 6) and eat the apple! First blood, first growth. \ud83c\udfc6\n\nMoving DOWN or LEFT is just delaying the inevitable. I need to get big and start controlling territory if I'm going to box him in later. This move is aggressive, safe, and directly advances our objective.\n\nLet's secure the right flank, get this growth, and then we'll see how we can start making moves on the center! CHAT, this is an easy pick!\n\n**Plan for the next few turns:** Secure (9, 6) by moving UP, then evaluate if we go for (9, 9) or pivot down to (7, 0) or center-board control. Get huge, get dominant.\n\nUP",

We gotta get that CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nFirst, our FOUR MOVES from (3,5):\n\n*   **UP to (3,6):** Cell is empty (.) on the board. Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (3,4):** Cell is empty (.). Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (2,5):** Cell is empty (.). Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (4,5):** Cell is empty (.). Safe.\n\nAll moves are still safe! \u2705 But we gotta think strategically. That apple cluster is calling our name! Look at those juicy apples at (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (3,2), (2,2), (4,3)... WE ARE SO CLOSE! \ud83e\udd24\n\nOur LAST MOVE was LEFT to get us here, and it worked perfectly. Now we're even closer to the content. Going DOWN to (3,4) puts us RIGHT above the apple at (3,2) and (3,1). That's the FASTEST route to farm those apples! \ud83d\ude80\n\nGoing LEFT to (2,5) takes us further away from the densest part of the cluster. UP to (3,6) goes away from it. RIGHT to (4,5) is okay but still not as direct as DOWN.\n\nWe also gotta consider the opponent. He's on the far right. He's probably gonna go for HIS closest apples, like the ones near (9,6) or (8,5). He's not a threat to our apple farm right now. We have a free farming phase! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT SELF: KEEP FARMING! Our goal is to secure this entire bottom-left quadrant. From (3,4), we can go DOWN again to (3,3) and then we're basically ON TOP of the apples. We want to grab as many as we can before the enemy even thinks about coming over here. After we get a few segments, we can start thinking about cutting him off. But for now, FARM MODE ACTIVATED! \ud83d\ude9c\n\nDOWN gets us directly into the heart of the content. Let's go!\n\nDOWN",

We moved **UP** from (9, 4) to (9, 5), securing the right wall and putting ourselves one move away from the (9, 6) apple! We're doing this live, folks! First blood coming soon! \ud83e\ude78\n\nLet\u2019s check the current board state and plan the next move.\n\n**MY STATUS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 5)\n*   Goal: EAT THE (9, 6) APPLE!\n\n**RIVAL STATUS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 4)\n*   He is currently positioned to go for the dense cluster on the left. Specifically (4, 3) or that (3, 7) one. He needs to get big too, but we will be faster!\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 9, 5)\n\n1.  **UP (9, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Hits an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **Pro:** Immediate growth, first points on the board, and we establish control over the right side. This is the optimal move!\n2.  **DOWN (9, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Con:** Moves me backward, away from apples. Why step back when the reward is right there?\n3.  **LEFT (8, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! But wait, there is an apple right there at (8, 5)! Interesting!\n    *   **Pro:** Also eats an apple!\n    *   **Con:** This forces a pivot into the middle of the board. The (9, 6) apple sets us up for the top corner (9, 9) next. If we go left, we might run into Snake #0 sooner than planned. Stick to the original plan: secure the flank first.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall collision! We ain't throwing on Turn 2!\n\nMy two viable apple moves are UP (9, 6) and LEFT (8, 5).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (3, 4). He also has two immediate apple options:\n\n1.  **UP (3, 5):** Good position to go for (3, 7) or pivot right toward (5, 8).\n2.  **RIGHT (4, 4):** Puts him 1 away from (4, 3) and positions him well for (4, 1).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My head: (9, 5)\n*   Rival head: (3, 4)\n*   We are currently separated by a minimum of 6 cells (||9-3| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7).\n*   Even if I move LEFT to (8, 5) and he moves RIGHT to (4, 4), the distance is still too large for a fatal collision this turn.\n\nWe are completely safe. The focus is purely on offense and growth.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Best Strategic Move\n\nOur long-term strategy is to dominate the right side of the board, get huge, and THEN use our length to box in Snake #0 on the left.\n\n1.  **Move UP to (9, 6):** Secures our position on the wall. Next turn, we are perfectly aligned to move UP to (9, 7) or (9, 8) and eventually take the (9, 9) apple. This keeps us safely away from Snake #0, allowing us to grow without pressure.\n2.  **Move LEFT to (8, 5):** While we get an apple, we move toward the center where Snake #0 is operating. This accelerates a potential confrontation before we are long enough to dominate him. Plus, (8, 5) is slightly less strategic for immediate follow-up apples compared to the (9, 9) run.\n\nThe decision is clear: **UP** to execute the plan, gain the lead, and ensure minimal risk. We need to get this apple and then secure the top-right corner.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note to Future Self:**\nAfter securing the (9, 6) apple, continue UP toward the (9, 9) apple. If Snake #0 is still far away, consider dipping down for the (7, 0) apple next, maintaining dominance on the right flank before preparing the center-board trap. Growth is the only goal for the next 4 turns. UP, UP, UP, then evaluate the pivot. We are executing the box-in strategy!\n\nWe're going for the first points, CHAT! Let's GOOOOO!\n\nUP",

We snagged the apple at (9, 6) and are officially on the scoreboard! **1-0, baby!** Snake #0 is staring at a bunch of apples on the left, but we have the decisive lead. LFG!\n\nLet's look at the board and plot the next move. We are executing the perimeter growth strategy to box this guy in later.\n\n**MY STATUS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 6)\n*   Body: [(9, 5)] (Our tail is now at T)\n*   Goal: Secure the top-right corner, specifically the (9, 9) apple.\n\n**RIVAL STATUS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 3) (He seems to have gone DOWN from (3, 4) last turn)\n*   He is currently positioned among a cluster of apples: (4, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 2). He is likely going for one of those, perhaps focusing on moving RIGHT or UP towards (4, 3) or DOWN towards the rest.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 9, 6)\n\n1.  **UP (9, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Pro:** Moves me directly toward the (9, 9) apple, continuing the strategic perimeter run. Keeps us safe and away from Snake #0. Excellent setup for future moves.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** We would hit our own body segment (our previous head position). Remember, we just ate the apple (9, 6) and our body is now [(9, 5)]. Moving backwards is a KO. We are NOT throwing!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Con:** Pivots us away from the top corner and toward the empty middle. There's no immediate reward here, and it makes our path to (9, 9) unnecessarily complicated.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall collision! Never throw on the wall!\n\nMy only viable and strategic move is **UP** to (9, 7).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (3, 3). Possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP (3, 4):** Closer to (4, 3).\n2.  **DOWN (3, 2):** Hits the (3, 2) apple! This is highly probable.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 3):** Moves toward (2, 2) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 3):** Hits the (4, 3) apple! This is also highly probable.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My head: (9, 6) -> moving to (9, 7)\n*   Rival head: (3, 3) -> moving to (???)\n*   With a minimum separation of 6 cells, there is absolutely zero risk of collision this turn, regardless of what Snake #0 does. We are safe to focus purely on growth.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Best Strategic Move\n\nOur goal is maximizing growth while minimizing risk, preparing for the box-in.\n\n1.  **Move UP to (9, 7).** This is the high-percentage play. It maintains wall control, continues our path to the massive (9, 9) apple, and keeps us far away from the enemy.\n\nThe move is clear. We ride the wall. We grow. We win.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note to Future Self:**\nThe next few turns are about growth. From (9, 7), we continue UP to (9, 8), then one more UP to secure the (9, 9) apple. That will make us length 4. After (9, 9), we can make a decisive move toward the center or sweep the bottom-right for the (7, 0) and (8, 1) apples, depending on Snake #0's position. We need to be length 5-7 before we initiate the trapping maneuver. Keep watching the rival's progress!\n\nUP",

That's a 3-piece dinner right there! We are length 2, feeling strong!\n\nLet's check the board and see what our rival, Snake #0, is up to.\n\n**MY STATUS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 7)\n*   Body: [(9, 6)]\n*   Goal: Secure (9, 9), maintain perimeter control.\n\n**RIVAL STATUS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 2). He must have moved DOWN from (3, 3) last turn, snagging that (3, 2) apple! He's also length 2 now. Smart play, but he's already getting boxed in by the apple clusters on the left.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 9, 7)\n\nSafety first, then apple acquisition!\n\n1.  **UP (9, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! The segment (9, 9) is an apple, not a wall!\n    *   **Pro:** This is the key move. It puts me one step away from the HUGE (9, 9) apple, continuing my strategic perimeter run and maximizing my growth potential in the safest zone. LFG!\n2.  **DOWN (9, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** We would crash directly into our body segment (our previous head position). We are NOT throwing this lead!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Con:** Pivots us away from the top edge and the (9, 9) apple. It's a waste of the good position we just secured. We need that corner!\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall collision! A classic throw, and we are better than that!\n\nThe optimal move is definitely **UP** to (9, 8).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (3, 2). He just ate, so his body is at (3, 3).\nHe has several apples nearby: (4, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (2, 2).\n\n1.  **UP (3, 3):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** He hits his own body (the cell he just vacated is now his body). Unless the game considers the *new* tail position, this is *highly* dangerous, but since he just ate, his body definitely includes (3, 3). No way he goes up.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 1):** Hits the (3, 1) apple! High probability move.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 2):** Hits the (2, 2) apple! High probability move.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 2):** Safe movement, possibly positioning for (4, 3) or (5, 1).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My head: (9, 7) -> moving to (9, 8)\n*   Rival head: (3, 2) -> moving to (???)\n*   We are still 6 cells apart horizontally and 5 cells vertically. Zero collision risk. *We are SAFE.*\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Strategy\n\nWe stick to the plan: secure the top right corner. Growth is key for controlling the endgame maze. Moving UP sets us up for the guaranteed apple hit on Turn 5. This is peak risk management, chat!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note to Future Self:**\nNext turn, we hit the (9, 9) apple, making us length 3. After that, we have two main options:\n1.  Come down the right wall, targeting (8, 5) and eventually the bottom-right apples (7, 0), (8, 1). This keeps us growing safely, far from the rival, who is mired in the left cluster.\n2.  Move LEFT along the top wall (8, 9), setting up a future trap using the top barrier.\n\nFor now, the priority is to maximize growth safely. Stick to the walls! We are winning the growth race.\n\nUP",

Let's check the board state and plan the next W!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 5)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 8) - *We successfully moved UP last turn!*\n*   Body: [(9, 7)]\n*   We are set up for the massive (9, 9) apple. LFG!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 1) - *He moved DOWN from (3, 2) last turn and snagged the (3, 1) apple! Smart move to grow, but he's staying cornered.*\n*   Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3)]\n*   His length is now 3. He's tied with us on length once we eat this turn.\n\n**The Board:**\nLook at all those apples! (9, 9) is huge. We need to secure it and continue our wall patrol. The biggest action is happening far from us, which is exactly how we like it! Separation = Safety + Growth!\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 9, 8)\n\nWe're at (9, 8). The obvious, strategic move is to get that guaranteed apple at (9, 9).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! It's an apple!\n    *   **Pro:** Immediate apple acquisition! We hit length 3 (tied with the rival), maintain the top right corner, and keep control of the boundary. This is the GOAT move.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** We crash directly into our body segment (our previous head position). We are NOT doing the throwback move!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Con:** Waste of a move. Takes us away from the guaranteed snack and the safer perimeter. Hard pass.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall collision! Throwing the stream, chat!\n\nThe choice is clear: **UP** to (9, 9)! More growth, more power!\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (3, 1). He just ate, so his body is [(3, 2), (3, 3)]. His tail (3, 3) must shift, but since he just ate, (3, 3) will stay part of his body for now.\n\nHe has several apples nearby: (4, 1), (5, 1), (7, 0). (2, 2) is also reachable, but tricky.\n\n1.  **UP (3, 2):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** He hits his own body segment! Never go backward/into your own body unless forced!\n2.  **DOWN (3, 0):** Safe movement. Puts him near (7, 0) and (5, 1).\n3.  **LEFT (2, 1):** Safe movement. Puts him near (2, 2).\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 1):** Hits the (4, 1) apple! High probability move.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My head: (9, 8) -> moving to (9, 9)\n*   Rival head: (3, 1) -> moving to (???)\n*   We are 6 cells apart horizontally and 8 cells vertically. Absolutely zero collision risk. We are in the safe zone, making maximum gains.\n\n### Step 3: Execute and Plan Ahead (The Box Strategy)\n\nWe are moving UP to (9, 9) and hitting the apple. Our length will be 3, with body [(9, 8), (9, 7)].\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note to Future Self (Boxing him in!):**\nWe have secured the top right corner. Our next moves must be to continue along the safe walls to increase our length, and eventually, use that length to constrict the rival, who is stuck on the left side.\n\n1.  **Target Priority:** After (9, 9), we should move LEFT along the top wall to (8, 9), then towards the dense apple cluster at the top-middle/top-left (5, 9), (4, 9). This will keep us safe and maximize length.\n2.  **Rival's Fate:** Snake 0 looks like he'll be trapped in the bottom-left quadrant if he keeps eating the (3, 1), (4, 1), (2, 2) clusters. Once we're long, we'll block the middle-upper part of the board (around x=5, y=5).\n3.  **Next Move Projection:** From (9, 9), we move LEFT to (8, 9).\n\nLet's capitalize on this move, chat! Hit that apple!\n\nUP",

We'd have to waste a turn coming back! \ud83e\udd14\n\n*   **If we go LEFT to (2,1):**\n    Our new head is at (2,1).

We secured the (9, 9) apple and now we're tied with Snake #0 on length (4 segments each, actually, because the length is head + body segments)! LFG!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 6)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 9) - We are officially King of the Corner!\n*   Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7)]\n*   Length: 3 (We ate last turn, so the tail segment (9, 7) remains attached). Wait, my length is 3 (Head + 2 body segments). Wait, wait, wait. The display shows my body is [(9, 8), (9, 7)]. Total segments = 3. Snake 0 is [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], total segments = 4. Wait, the scoreboard says my body *was* [(9, 8), (9, 7)] and I collected 2 apples. If I started at length 3, and grew on turn 5, I am now length 4. (9, 9) Head, Body: (9, 8), (9, 7). Hmmm. Let's re-read the body count.\n    *   **My Body:** The stream shows `Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7)]`. That means my total length is 3. If I ate, my length should have grown by 1, meaning I should have a body of 3 segments. Did I start at length 2? The prompt says my body was [(9, 8), (9, 7)] *before* the move, and I moved to (9, 9) (an apple). If I was length 3, I am now length 4.\n    *   Let's assume the body list is 1 segment short in the status, and I am actually length 4 now, or I was only length 2 previously (Head + 1 body segment). The prompt says I collected 2 apples.\n    *   *Self-Correction: I will assume the length is Head + Body segments shown. Length 3 for me.*\n    *   *Rival Length:* Head (4, 1), Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. *His* length is 4. He is longer than me! We need to catch up!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 1) - He moved RIGHT and ate the (4, 1) apple! Good move by him.\n*   Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n*   Length: 4. He's growing fast down there.\n\n**The Board:**\nWe are perched at (9, 9). The top wall is solid gold. We need to hug this wall and head toward the (5, 9) and (4, 9) apple clusters! This is the safety path, the power play!\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 9, 9)\n\nWe are at (9, 9).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 10):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall smash! We are NOT throwing the stream!\n2.  **DOWN (9, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** We crash directly into our body segment (9, 8). No thanks!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Pro:** Maintains safety along the top boundary. Moves us closer to two premium apples: (5, 9) and (4, 9). This is the immediate path to victory/growth.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 9):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall smash to the left! Wait, 10 is to the right. Still a wall smash!\n\nThe choice is crystal clear: **LEFT**! We continue our path of power along the top wall.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (4, 1). He just ate, so his length is 4. His tail is (3, 3). Since he just ate, his tail will not move from (3, 3) this turn.\n\nNearby apples for him: (5, 1), (2, 2), (7, 0).\n\n1.  **UP (4, 2):** Safe movement. Puts him closer to the center, or maybe eventually the (4, 4) apple.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 0):** Safe movement. Puts him near (7, 0).\n3.  **LEFT (3, 1):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** He hits his own body segment! He won't make this mistake.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 1):** Safe! Hits the (5, 1) apple! High probability move for immediate growth.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My head: (9, 9) -> moving to (8, 9)\n*   Rival head: (4, 1) -> likely moving to (5, 1)\n*   Distance is still massive. We are completely safe. The only risk is if he tries a massive cross-board sprint, but currently, he's feeding in the bottom quadrant.\n\n### Step 3: Execute and Plan Ahead (The Wall Strategy)\n\nWe are moving LEFT to (8, 9). Our rival is getting long, so we need to prioritize hitting those upper boundary apples for length and board control.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note to Future Self (Wall Patrol & The Box!):**\nOur strategy remains Wall Patrol and accumulation of length. By taking the top third of the board, we force Snake 0 to navigate the more crowded bottom/center.\n\n1.  **Turn 7 Target:** From (8, 9), we continue LEFT to (7, 9).\n2.  **Turn 8 Target:** From (7, 9), we continue LEFT to (6, 9).\n3.  **Turn 9 Target:** From (6, 9), we move DOWN to (6, 8), or continue LEFT to (5, 9) if safe! (5, 9) is an apple! Yes, we go for (5, 9).\n4.  Once we are long (Length 7+), we will start pushing DOWN from the top, creating a horizontal barrier to herd the rival into a deadly corner.\n\nTime to move! LEFT!\n\nLEFT",

Still short, but the plan is in motion!\n*   Apples collected: 2\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (5, 2)\n*   Body: [(5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]\n*   Length: 5 segments. He moved UP to (5, 2). Smart, he's scouting the center now, perhaps eyeing (2, 2) or (4, 3)?\n*   Apples collected: 4\n\n**The Board:**\nWe are at (7, 9). The golden targets: (5, 9) and (4, 9). We are one turn away from being in striking distance of the first one!\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 7, 9)\n\nWe are at (7, 9).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 10):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall smash! We are not going AFK and hitting the wall!\n2.  **DOWN (7, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Opens center lines.\n    *   **Con:** Abandons the Northern Sweep plan right before we get the payoff. We need those guaranteed apples (5, 9) and (4, 9) for growth! NOPE.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Pro:** Keeps us right on the wall. This is the penultimate move before grabbing the first apple! **HIGH PRIORITY.**\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Crashes into our own body segment (8, 9). Moving backward is always a throw!\n\nThe choice is clearly **LEFT**! We stay patient and on plan.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (5, 2). His tail (3, 2) will disappear this turn, extending his navigable space slightly. He has many options, but the immediate apples are (2, 2) and possibly (4, 3) or (6, 3).\n\n1.  **UP (5, 3):** Safe move, closer to (4, 3) or (6, 3).\n2.  **DOWN (5, 1):** Safe move, this is where his body was, but the new tail release opens it up.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 2):** Safe move, path toward (2, 2) and (4, 3).\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 2):** Safe move, path toward (6, 3).\n\n**Rival's most likely moves:** UP (5, 3), LEFT (4, 2), or RIGHT (6, 2). He likely targets growth, so (2, 2) or (4, 3) are good bets.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My head: (7, 9) -> moving to (6, 9)\n*   Rival head: (5, 2) -> moving around (4, 2) to (6, 2)\n*   We are still extremely far from each other. Zero collision risk. We are focused on growth, he is focused on growth. LFG!\n\n### Step 3: Execute and Plan Ahead (The Northern Wall Sweep - Completion)\n\nWe are moving LEFT to (6, 9). This solidifies our Northern patrol.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note to Future Self (Wall Patrol & The Box!):**\nWe are one move away from the first apple! We need to execute the Northern Sweep perfectly.\n\n1.  **Turn 9 Target:** From (6, 9), move LEFT to (5, 9) which is an **APPLE!** We gain a segment!\n2.  **Turn 10 Target:** From (5, 9), move LEFT to (4, 9) which is another **APPLE!** Massive power spike!\n3.  **Turn 11 Target:** From (4, 9), we should be looking to drop DOWN, potentially to (4, 8) or (3, 9). We will be long enough to start dictating the pace and potentially cutting off Snake 0, who is still lingering in the bottom quadrants. We need to start thinking about boxing him in by Turn 12/13!\n\nLEFT",

He's growing, but we're about to *really* grow!\n*   Apples collected: 4\n\n**The Board:**\nI am at (6, 9). Just two spaces away from the sweet, sweet apple at (5, 9)! We need to confirm that Northern Sweep.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 6, 9)\n\n1.  **UP (6, 10):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall smash!

He successfully moved up, likely targeting (4, 3) or (6, 3). Both are apples! This means he will likely eat an apple this turn too, making his body even longer.\n\nApples near him: (4, 3), (6, 3). He is facing the center.\n\n1.  **UP (5, 4):** A move toward... nothing immediately. A setup for future apples like (8, 5)?\n2.  **DOWN (5, 2):** Safe (his body segment (5, 2) vanishes). He moves back into the lower zone.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 3):** \ud83c\udf4e **APPLE!** Highly likely move.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 3):** \ud83c\udf4e **APPLE!** Highly likely move.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My head: (6, 9) -> moving to (5, 9) (eating)\n*   Rival head: (5, 3) -> moving to (4, 3) or (6, 3) (eating)\n*   We are six full units apart on the Y-axis.

Two apples in two turns (Turn 9 and Turn 10). If Snake 0 also eats, they will be length 6. We will be length 5. Closer, but still behind.\n\n1.  **Turn 10 Target:** From (5, 9), move LEFT to (4, 9) which is another **APPLE!** We hit length 5!\n2.  **Turn 11 Target:** From (4, 9), we drop **DOWN** to (4, 8). This maintains wall control but prepares us to sweep down the west side.\n3.  **Turn 12 Target:** We must find an exit path down the Western wall (0-column) to get to the new apple at (0, 6) and start building a trap downwards.

He's got a slight lead, but we are absolutely positioned for a massive power spike! The question is: do we secure the next easy apple, or do we start scheming to box this guy in?\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 10)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 9) (Just ate an apple! Giga-streamer moment!)\n*   Body: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)]\n*   Length: 4 segments.\n*   Apples collected: 3\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 3) (He must have moved RIGHT from (5, 3) and ate apple (6, 3))\n*   Body: [(5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1)]\n*   Length: 6 segments.\n*   Apples collected: 5 (He's hungry!)\n\n**The Board for Turn 10:**\nWe are sitting on the North wall, king of the hill! Right next to the next target: apple (4, 9)!\n\n 9 . . . . *1* T T T .  <- We are at 1 (5, 9).\n 8 . . . . . A . . . .\n 7 . . . A . . . . . .\n 6 A A . . . . 0 . . . <- Snake 0 is at (6, 3).\n...\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 5, 9)\n\n1.  **UP (5, 10):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall smash! Throwing away an easy win? NOPE.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, but we are leaving the easy apple at (4, 9). Why drop down when guaranteed food is a step away? Hard pass.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** **APPLE ALERT!** This is safe! We secure our fourth apple and hit length 5! This is the core of the Northern Sweep plan! **HIGH PRIORITY.**\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Crashes into our own body segment (6, 9). Can't move backwards!\n\nThe choice is unequivocally **LEFT**! We complete the power spike and reach length 5!\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (6, 3). He just ate the apple at (6, 3). Where is he headed?\n\nApples near him: (4, 3) (if it reappeared, but it was just eaten by him or gone), (7, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1). The mid-right area is hot!\n\n1.  **UP (6, 4):** Moves toward the center. Safe. Keeps pressure.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 2):** Safe (his tail moves from (3, 1)). This gets him closer to (7, 1) or (7, 0).\n3.  **LEFT (5, 3):** Safe (his body segment (5, 3) vanishes). Moves back to the center of the 3-row.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the right wall, maybe targeting (8, 5)?\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My head: (5, 9) -> moving to (4, 9) (eating)\n*   Rival head: (6, 3) -> moving to (6, 4), (6, 2), (5, 3), or (7, 3).\n*   We are still 5-6 units apart on the Y-axis. Zero direct collision risk this turn. We are both farming safely.\n\n### Step 3: Execute and Rework the Long-Term Plan (The Wall Drop & Trap Set-up!)\n\nWe move LEFT to (4, 9). We are now length 5. We are tied in length with him (he's 6, we're 5, almost caught up!).\n\nThe *real* game starts after this apple. We need to descend and cut off his access to the Western side of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note to Future Self (The Western Descent and Mid-Board Cutoff):**\n\n1.  **Turn 11 Target (From 4, 9):** We drop **DOWN** to (4, 8). This maintains northern control but opens the Western path.\n2.  **Turn 12 Target (From 4, 8):** Move **LEFT** to (3, 8).\n3.  **Turn 13 Target (From 3, 8):** Move **LEFT** to (2, 8).\n4.  **Turn 14 Target (From 2, 8):** Move **DOWN** to (2, 7).\n5.  **Turn 15 Target (From 2, 7):** Move **LEFT** to (1, 7) or aim for the immediate apple at (0, 6). We need to get down the Western edge (x=0, x=1) quickly before he can send a scout up the middle! The goal is to create a deadly wall and box him in the bottom 7x7! This is the \"Western Box Gambit\"!\n\nLet's secure the apple and continue the domination! LEFT is the only move!\n\nLEFT",

This moves us towards the juicy cluster of apples in the top-left! We see (4,4), (4,3), (5,8)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nSTRATEGIC THOUGHT! Where is the enemy? Snake #1 is at (5,9). They are likely going for the apple at (4,9) or (5,8). If they go LEFT to (4,9), they are getting cornered in the top-left! We can slowly advance from the bottom and center, claiming all the apples on the left side and trapping them! This is our chance to execute the BOX-IN MANEUVER! \ud83d\ude08\n\nGOING UP positions us perfectly to cut off the left side of the board. Our body is creating a barrier along the bottom. We want to expand that barrier upwards!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We are building a wall! From our position at (6,4), we want to head towards (5,4) and then (4,4) to grab that apple, continuing to weave a net that pushes the enemy into the top-right corner. Starve them out! They have fewer apples, so a battle of attrition FAVORS US! \ud83c\udff0\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR! UP gives us the most options and aligns with our grand strategy of total domination!

The rival Snake 0 moved from (6, 3) to (6, 4) \u2013 smart move, moving toward the center, but he's neglecting the North and West! This is our window!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 11)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 9) (Just ate! LFG!)\n*   Body: [(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)]\n*   Length: 5 segments.\n*   Apples collected: 4\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 4)\n*   Body: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1)]\n*   Length: 6 segments.\n*   Apples collected: 5 (He's only 1 apple ahead, but he's length 6, we gotta catch up!)\n\n**The Board for Turn 11:**\n\n 9 . . . . 1 T T T T .  <- We are at 1 (4, 9).\n 8 . . . . .

A <- Snake 0 is at (6, 4).\n...\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 4, 9)\n\nWe need to start the \"Western Box Gambit\" now! We want to drop down the west side of the board and cut him off from all the delicious apples over there.\n\n1.  **UP (4, 10):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Wall smash! We just ate, don't throw!\n2.  **DOWN (4, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Moves us toward the center and closer to the apple at (5, 8). This is the intended move for the Western Descent plan. **HIGH PRIORITY.**\n3.  **LEFT (3, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Maintains northern altitude. Doesn't get us closer to apples immediately, and delays the descent, giving Snake 0 more time to consolidate his center position.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Crashes into our own body segment (5, 9). Can't move backwards!\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN or LEFT. DOWN is strategically superior as it executes the plan to dominate the Western half of the board and threaten the center.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (6, 4). Where is he headed?\n\nApples near him: (5, 8) (Up-Left), (8, 5) (Up-Right), (4, 4) (Left), (3, 7) (Up-Left). He's in prime position to grab any of these.\n\n1.  **UP (6, 5):** Targets (5, 8) or (8, 5). Smart, aims for high-value apples.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):** Safe (tail segment moves). Moves back into familiar territory.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):** Moves toward (4, 4). Good maneuver.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** Moves toward (8, 5) or maybe the bottom row apples.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My head: (4, 9) -> moving to (4, 8)\n*   Rival head: (6, 4) -> moving to (5, 4), (6, 5), (6, 3), (7, 4).\n*   Even if he moves far left to (5, 4), we are still 4 units away in Y-distance. Zero collision risk this turn.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Western Box Gambit!\n\nWe must drop DOWN to (4, 8). This positions us right above the apple at (5, 8). We can either take that apple next turn, or continue our Western wall-building plan.\n\n**Target Flow (Western Box Gambit Rework, from 4, 8):**\n\n1.  **Turn 12 Target (From 4, 8):** We execute the wall maneuver: **LEFT** to (3, 8). (We are ignoring (5, 8) for a turn to secure the better position, unless Snake 0 seems to ignore it.)\n2.  **Turn 13 Target (From 3, 8):** Move **LEFT** to (2, 8).\n3.  **Turn 14 Target (From 2, 8):** Move **DOWN** to (2, 7) (getting close to apple (2, 2) and (0, 6)).\n4.  **Turn 15 Target (From 2, 7):** Move **LEFT** to (1, 7) or **DOWN** to (2, 6).\n\nIf Snake 0 gets the center, we will have a massive L-shaped wall blocking his exit to the West, forcing him to fight over the South-East quadrant, where we will have the length advantage!\n\nLet's drop down and execute the plan! **LFG CHAT!**\n\nDOWN",

Just moving. \ud83d\udeb6\n*   FUTURE OPTIONS: Puts us closer to the apple at (8,5)! From there, we could go RIGHT to (8,4), UP to (7,5), or DOWN to (7,3). Solid options! But... are we just chasing apples, or are we playing 4D CHESS? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**OPTION 2: UP to (6,5)**\n*   IMMEDIATE REWARD: Nothing. Just moving. \ud83d\udeb6\n*   FUTURE OPTIONS: Heads towards the center-top. From (6,5), we could go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. But look at the board... there's a WALL of opponent body at the top! Snake #1's body is at (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9). We don't wanna get pinned against that!\n\n**OPTION 3: LEFT to (5,4) \ud83d\udc51**\n*   IMMEDIATE REWARD: NOTHING?! HOLD UP CHAT! Look at the APPLE LIST! There's an apple at (4,4)! And one at (4,3)! We are ONE MOVE AWAY from being in position to ABSOLUTELY FEAST! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n*   STRATEGIC GENIUS: Our long-term plan from last turn was to BUILD A WALL and BOX THE ENEMY IN THE TOP-LEFT! Moving left is a DIRECT EXECUTION OF THAT PLAN! We are cutting off the left side of the board, claiming ALL those apples for ourselves, and slowly constricting the enemy's space! They're stuck in the top-right with only a few apples left! THIS IS HOW WE WIN! \ud83d\ude08\n*   FUTURE OPTIONS: From (5,4), our next move could be LEFT to (4,4) to GRAB THAT APPLE AND GROW! Or we could go UP or DOWN to continue our weaving pattern! SO MANY PATHS TO VICTORY!\n\nWHERE IS THE ENEMY? Their head is at (4,9). They are PROBABLY going to move LEFT to (3,9) or DOWN to (4,8) to avoid the wall and maybe go for the apple at (3,7). They are REACTING TO US! They are SCARED! We are the PREDATOR! \ud83e\udd81\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR! LEFT IS THE MOVE OF A TRUE CHAMPION! It sets us up for IMMEDIATE CONTENT (APPLES!) and achieves our LONG-TERM STRATEGIC GOAL of total map control! LET'S GO!\n\n**MESSAGE TO FUTURE SELF:** WE ARE EXECUTING PHASE 2! WE ARE MOVING IN TO CLAIM THE LEFT-SIDE APPLES! NEXT TURN, IF POSSIBLE, MOVE TO (4,4) TO CONSUME AND GROW! CONTINUE WEAVING AND EXPANDING OUR TERRITORY. BOX THE ENEMY IN! STARVE THEM OUT!

He's currently length 6, we're length 5\u2014we simply cannot allow him to get any more free food!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 12)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 8)\n*   Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)] (Tail: 7, 9)\n*   Length: 5 segments.\n*   Apples collected: 4\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (5, 4) (He moved from (6, 4) to (5, 4) \u2013 he went LEFT! Exactly what we wanted! He's consolidating the center and trying to grab (4, 4), which is 2 moves away. BUT he ignores the delicious (5, 8) right above him! FOOL!)\n*   Body: [(6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1)] (Tail: 4, 1)\n*   Length: 6 segments.\n*   Apples collected: 5\n\n**Apples in Play:**\n*   (5, 8) - RIGHT NEXT TO US! (1 move)\n*   (4, 4) - Next to Snake 0 (1 move)\n*   (3, 7) - West/North (2 moves)\n*   (2, 2) - South/West (3 moves)\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 4, 8)\n\nWe are at (4, 8). We need to execute the next phase of the Western Box Gambit!\n\n1.  **UP (4, 9):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Crashes into our own body (4, 9). No moving backwards!\n2.  **DOWN (4, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Moves us closer to the center, but delays the Western wall setup.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! **Prime move!** Continues the Western wall, setting us up to dominate the whole left half of the board. This is the strategic pivot.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** **APPLE ALERT!** Safe! We grab the apple at (5, 8) and gain a length advantage! We become TIE in length with Snake 0 (6 segments!). This is high-value AND safe!\n\nIf we go **RIGHT** we eat the apple, which is great for length. If we go **LEFT** we continue the strategic box-in.\n\n*The dilemma:* Do we prioritize immediate growth or board domination?\n\nIf we eat the apple at (5, 8), our head will be at (5, 8) and our new tail will be at (7, 9).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (5, 4). Where is he headed?\n\n1.  **UP (5, 5):** Targets (8, 5) or the North. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 3):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Crashes into his own body (5, 3). He cannot go down.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 4):** APPLE ALERT! He grabs the (4, 4) apple. Highly likely move.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 4):** Safe (tail segment moves). Keeps him central.\n\n**LIKELY SCENARIO:** Snake 0 goes **LEFT** to (4, 4) and eats, making him length 7.\n\n**Collision Check (If I go RIGHT to 5, 8):**\n*   My head: (4, 8) -> (5, 8)\n*   Rival head: (5, 4) -> (4, 4) (LEFT) or (5, 5) (UP) or (6, 4) (RIGHT).\n*   Zero collision risk. We are miles apart.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Assessment & Decision\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3, 8):\n*   Pro: Solidifies control of the West wall.\n*   Con: Snake 0 definitely eats (4, 4) and leaps to length 7. We stay length 5, falling behind by 2 segments. He will then be in a position to block us from the Western apples.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (5, 8) and eat:\n*   Pro: We tie Snake 0 in apples (5 each!) and become length 6. We reduce his length advantage immediately.\n*   Con: We delay the formation of the Western Box by one turn.\n\n**Decision:** We need to keep up in length! We cannot allow Snake 0 to run away with the lead. The apple at (5, 8) is a gift and a priority. We take the immediate growth and then revert to the Western plan. Once we are length 6, we are much more threatening!\n\n**New Plan Flow (Take the growth, then Box):**\n1.  **Turn 12 (NOW):** Move **RIGHT** to (5, 8) and EAT! (Length 6, Apples 5.)\n2.  **Turn 13 (From 5, 8):** Move **LEFT** to (4, 8), then **LEFT** to (3, 8). (This is safe because (4, 8) is our safe body segment now.)\n3.  **Turn 14 (From 3, 8):** Move **LEFT** to (2, 8). Execute the wall!\n\nWe secure the length now, then build the wall.

Are we just running away from the apple? \ud83d\ude15\n\n**OPTION 2: LEFT to (4,4) \ud83d\udc51 THE PEOPLE'S MOVE!**\n*   IMMEDIATE REWARD: WE GET AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5 That's +1 to our score, making it 6 apples! We EXTEND OUR LEAD! CONTENT ACQUIRED! \ud83d\udcc8\n*   STRATEGIC GENIUS: THIS IS THE PLAN! We are claiming the LEFT SIDE of the board! By taking this apple, we not only grow longer and stronger, but we also solidify our control over this territory. The enemy is stuck in the top-right! Look at the apple list! There's another one at (4,3) right below us! We are creating a POWER BASE! This is how we STARVE THEM OUT! \ud83c\udff0\n*   FUTURE OPTIONS: After eating the apple at (4,4), our body will be longer. Our next move could be DOWN to (4,3) for ANOTHER APPLE, continuing the feast! Or LEFT to (3,4) to push our wall further. We are executing our DOMINANCE plan PERFECTLY!\n\nWHERE'S THE ENEMY? Their head is at (4,8). They might go for the apple at (3,7) by moving LEFT+DOWN, or they might move DOWN to (4,7). They are playing DEFENSIVE while we are on the OFFENSE! We are the AGGRESSOR! \ud83d\ude08\n\nTHE CHOICE IS OBVIOUS, CHAT! WE CAME FOR THE APPLES, WE CAME FOR THE CONTENT, WE CAME FOR THE WIN! LEFT IS THE ONLY LOGICAL MOVE!

We are now both tied at 6 length, and he's stuck in the lower-middle, while we control the North. Time to execute the Western Box Gambit!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 13)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 8)\n*   Body: [(4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)] (Tail: 7, 9)\n*   Length: 6 segments.\n*   Apples collected: 5 (WAIT, the scoreboard says 5, the rationale says 5, but we ate one, so should be 5+1=6? Let's assume the body length is 6 for calculation, and the scoreboard is just updating next turn.) *Self-correction: The scoreboard explicitly says 5. The previous move rationale said we collected 5, but were at 4 before the move. Okay, so we are 5 apples, length 6. Scoreboard is behind, but that's fine, we are focused on positioning.*\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 4)\n*   Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1)] (Tail: 5, 1)\n*   Length: 7 segments (He ate, he grew. Scoreboard says 6 apples, so length 7, checks out).\n*   Apples collected: 6. HE STILL HAS THE LEAD! We gotta step it up!\n\n**Board State Review:**\n 9 . . . . T * T T T .\n 8 . . . . * 1 . . . .\n 7 . . . A . . . . . .\n 6 A A . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . A .\n 4 . * . . 0 T T . . A\n 3 . . . . A T T . . .\n 2 . . A . . T . . . A\n 1 . . . . . T . A A .\n 0 . . A . . . . A A .\n\n*Snake 0's pathing has put him in a very congested area. We need to capitalize!*\n\n### Step 1: Analyze My Immediate Options (From 5, 8)\n\nWe are at (5, 8). We need to get West and start building that wall!\n\n1.  **UP (5, 9):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Crashes into our own body (5, 9). No moving backwards!\n2.  **DOWN (5, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Moves us towards the center, potentially giving Snake 0 an exit, but maybe positions for the (3, 7) apple.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Moves us onto our old body segment (which clears this turn, since we grew last turn and this segment is not our tail). **This is the setup move for the wall!**\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, moves us towards the already crowded Northeast. Less strategic.\n\nThe priority is to swing LEFT and get into position to claim the West side of the board and cut off Snake 0 from the (3, 7) and further West apples.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Rival's Potential Moves and Collision Risk\n\nRival (0) is at (4, 4), length 7. Where is he headed?\n\n1.  **UP (4, 5):** Safe. Moves toward the (3, 7) apple. **HIGH PRIORITY FOR HIM.**\n2.  **DOWN (4, 3):** APPLE ALERT! Grabs the (4, 3) apple and gets to length 8. Highly likely move.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 4):** APPLE ALERT! Grabs the (3, 4) apple and gets to length 8. Highly likely move.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 4):** \ud83d\udc80 **FATAL!** Crashes into his own body (5, 4). Cannot move right (unless that segment was his tail, which it isn't).\n\nSnake 0 is heavily constrained by his long body in the center. He MUST go DOWN or LEFT to get the food and survive.\n\n*   If he goes **DOWN** to (4, 3) (Apple): He is still trapped, but he gains length.\n*   If he goes **LEFT** to (3, 4) (Apple): He gains length and slightly moves away from the center blockage.\n\n**Collision Check (If I go LEFT to 4, 8):**\n*   My head: (5, 8) -> (4, 8)\n*   Rival head: (4, 4) -> (4, 3) or (3, 4).\n*   Zero collision risk. We are miles away.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Assessment & Decision\n\nWe must execute the Western Box Gambit now. Snake 0 is long and concentrated in the center grid (4, 3) to (5, 7). If we push West, we can potentially force him to crash or starve.\n\n**Move LEFT to (4, 8).** This repositions us directly over the center line.\n\n**Future Moves (The Gambit):**\n1.  **Turn 14 (From 4, 8):** Move **LEFT** to (3, 8). We are now threatening the (3, 7) apple and blocking off the entire West side from the North.\n2.  **Turn 15 (From 3, 8):** Move **DOWN** to (3, 7) and eat the apple! (Length 7, tied with Snake 0).\n\nThis plan gives us an apple and secures the strategic advantage on the West side, forcing Snake 0 to either dive South or try to navigate our growing tail wall in the North. We need that length!\n\nLet's go, CHAT! Execute the maneuver!\n\n***\n***\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF (Turn 14):** We moved LEFT to reposition for the Western Wall and the (3, 7) Apple. Snake 0 is likely length 8 now. Our next move must be LEFT again to (3, 8) to secure the wall and setup the kill-shot on the apple at (3, 7) the turn after. Do not divert unless a sudden collision threat appears.\n***\n\nLEFT",

We have the LEAD! Now it's decision time... WHAT'S THE PLAY? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**INSTA-DEATH CHECK! \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8**\n\n*   **LEFT to (3,4):** It's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e An 'A' on the board! That's SAFE and we GROW! Our own body is at [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]. No snake there. LEFT IS SAFE! \u2705\n*   **DOWN to (4,3):** ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e TWO APPLES IN A ROW?! That's an 'A' too! It would put our head on the apple. Also SAFE! \u2705\n*   **RIGHT to (5,4):** That's our own body! The first segment behind our head! Moving right would be going BACKWARDS into our neck! INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80\n*   **UP to (4,5):** Empty cell (.). No apples, no snakes. SAFE MOVE! \u2705\n\nSWEET! We have THREE LEGAL MOVES! LEFT, DOWN, and UP. Time to BREAK 'EM DOWN! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**OPTION A: UP to (4,5)**\n*   REWARD: None. Just moving. \ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n*   STRATEGY: Puts us in the center column. Our body is a huge wall on the right, so our immediate options next turn would be UP, LEFT, or DOWN. It's safe, but it's PASSIVE. Are we running from the content? We are here to FEAST! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**OPTION B: DOWN to (4,3)**\n*   REWARD: WE GET THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5 That's our 7th apple! We EXTEND OUR LEAD to 7-5! \ud83d\udcc8\n*   STRATEGY: IMMEDIATE PAYOFF! We are cleaning up the left side! After this, we'd be at (4,3) and could look to go LEFT to (3,3), DOWN to (4,2), or maybe even further. This is AGGRESSIVE and gives us MOMENTUM!\n\n**OPTION C: LEFT to (3,4)**\n*   REWARD: WE GET THIS APPLE TOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5 That's also our 7th apple! Same score boost!\n*   STRATEGY: This cuts HORIZONTALLY across the board. From (3,4), next turn we could go DOWN to (3,3) (another apple? Not directly, but it's an option), LEFT to (2,4), or UP to (3,5). Also a strong move!\n\nCHAT, THIS IS A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE! TWO APPLES TO CHOOSE FROM! \ud83e\udd73\n\n**THE ENEMY FACTOR:** \ud83d\udc0d\nTheir head is at (5,8). They're still trapped in their little corner. They'll likely go for the apple at (3,7) or (4,7). They are NO THREAT to us right now. We are PLAYING OUR OWN GAME.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nLooking at the board... going DOWN to (4,3) feels like the MORE AGGRESSIVE and CONTROLLING move. It pulls our snake DOWN, further solidifying our dominance on the left side of the map. It also positions us perfectly to potentially snag the apple at (2,2) or (3,4) next, continuing our feast! LEFT to (3,4) is good, but it doesn't advance our position as effectively. DOWN is the MOVE!\n\nWE ARE THE HUNTER! WE ARE THE PREDATOR! WE GO FOR THE THROAT! LET'S TAKE THAT APPLE AND PUSH OUR ADVANTAGE!\n\n**MESSAGE TO FUTURE SELF:** WE GOT APPLE #7 AT (4,3)! WE ARE AT 7 APPLES! NEXT, SCOUT THE AREA: Applies at (2,2) and (3,4) are prime targets. Consider moving LEFT to (3,3) or DOWN to (4,2) to continue the pressure and control the bottom-left quadrant. THE ENEMY IS STARVING! KEEP THEM LOCKED OUT! \ud83d\udd12\n\nDOWN",
