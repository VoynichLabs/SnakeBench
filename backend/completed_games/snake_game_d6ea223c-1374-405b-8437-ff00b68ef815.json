It also moves me away from my own body line at y=7, keeping multiple escape routes open.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move DOWN now to open routes toward the apples at (2,3) and the lower cluster.\n- After that, continue toward (2,3) (via x=1 then x=2) while avoiding moving into my own body and keeping at least two exits each turn.\n- If the enemy moves closer to the right side, prioritize safety and avoid head-on confrontations.\n\nDOWN",

From (2,5) I'll have 3 good follow-up options (R/U/D), keeping flexibility.\n\nCompare DOWN vs RIGHT: both reduce distance to (2,3) equally, but RIGHT puts me directly under the apple column (x=2), allowing a straightforward down-down approach to (2,3). RIGHT also avoids the board edge trap that LEFT would create.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move RIGHT now to (2,5).\n- Next turn go DOWN toward (2,3) and eat that apple.
