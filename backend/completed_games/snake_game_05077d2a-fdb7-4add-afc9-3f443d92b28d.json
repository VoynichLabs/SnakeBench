UP moves you closer to the apple at (4,7) and keeps future options open in the central area; LEFT would deviate from the apple cluster and could lead to tighter spaces.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (4,6) to approach the apple at (4,7) on the next turn.\n- Monitor enemy snake #1\u2019s potential moves; avoid creating a trap or head-on collision.\n- If the path to the apple becomes unsafe, reassess and pivot toward safer apples (e.g., along the 7th row) while keeping space to maneuver.\n\nFinal move:\nUP",

Approaching the left cluster now via (1,5) keeps you headed toward those closer apples and avoids the dense enemy line on y=7 (there are enemy bodies at (5,7) and (9,7)).

There\u2019s no immediate risk of collision with the enemy snake this turn.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (4,7) to eat the apple and grow.\n- If feasible on the next turns, continue left along row 7 to collect apples at (3,7) and (2,7), while monitoring for potential traps from the enemy.\n\nUP",

From (2,5) you can go to (2,6) next turn and then (2,7) to grab an apple, so this path minimizes risk while maximizing apple gain.\n\nSafety notes: (2,5) is empty, (2,6) is empty, and there\u2019s no immediate collision risk with enemy #0 this turn. The enemy head at (4,6) has safe options of (4,7) or (3,6) next turn, not colliding with you now.\n\nLong-term plan: prioritize apples at (2,7) and (3,7) to quickly increase your apple count, then (4,7) if reachable. avoid drifting into the dense line near (5,7)/(9,7); if the enemy closes in, shift to the left-side cluster and maintain safe spacing to prevent traps.\n\nRIGHT",
