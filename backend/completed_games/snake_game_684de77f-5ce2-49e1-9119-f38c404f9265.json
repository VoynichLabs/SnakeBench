No immediate threats here (no snake or wall).\n2. **DOWN**: (5, 3) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (6, 3), but moving down to (5, 3) doesn't directly help unless we're planning to go right next turn.\n3. **LEFT**: (4, 4) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (4, 4), so moving left would allow us to eat the apple and grow.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 4) - This is within the board. There's no apple here, but moving right might be useful for future moves.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **UP (5, 5)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, opens up future moves towards other apples.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points (no apple at (5, 5)).\n\n2. **DOWN (5, 3)**:\n   - Pros: Closer to the apple at (6, 3), which could be reached next turn by moving right.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n3. **LEFT (4, 4)**:\n   - Pros: Directly eats the apple at (4, 4), gaining a point and growing.\n   - Cons: After eating, the snake's body will be at (5, 4), so next move must not go back to (5, 4) (which is already handled since the snake grows, and the body is at the previous head position).\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 4)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, could be useful for future moves.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe most immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (4, 4) by moving left. This gives us a point and grows our snake, which is always a good move in Snake. After eating, our body will be at (5, 4), and our head will be at (4, 4). Next turn, we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5, 4) (which would be right, but since we're growing, the body is at the previous head position, so moving right would be safe as long as we don't have a body there yet\u2014but actually, after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4), so moving right to (5,4) would collide with our own body, which is bad. Wait, no: when you move, the body follows the head's previous position. So after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4). Then if we move right from (4,4), we'd go to (5,4), which is our body\u2014this would kill us. So after moving left to eat the apple, we cannot move right next turn. But we can move up, down, or left (but left from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is safe unless there's a wall or snake there, which there isn't).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after eating at (4,4), where can we go next?\n- From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5) - safe\n  - DOWN: (4,3) - safe\n  - LEFT: (3,4) - safe\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - our body, so die. So cannot go right next turn.\n\nBut is there a better apple to go for next? The other apples are at (6,3), (0,8), (2,1), (6,1). From (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is adjacent to (6,3), so we could go down then right to (6,3). But (6,3) is two moves away, and we'd have to avoid our own body.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,5) puts us closer to (6,5) or (4,6), but no apples are up there immediately.\n\nMoving left to (3,4) is safe, but no immediate apples nearby.\n\nSo the immediate best move is to eat the apple at (4,4) by moving left. Then next turn, we can choose a direction that doesn't lead to our body. For example, after moving left to (4,4), we could move down to (4,3), then right to (6,3) to eat another apple.\n\nBut is there a better immediate move? Let's see if moving down to (5,3) is better. From (5,3), we can move right to (6,3) to eat the apple there. But this is two moves to eat an apple, whereas moving left to (4,4) eats an apple immediately.\n\nSo moving left is better for immediate gain.\n\n### Checking for Threats:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,9), far away from us. No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate move is to move **LEFT** to (4,4) to eat the apple there, gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nNext turn, from (4,4), we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5,4). Possible options:\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3) (then can go right to (6,3) next)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\nBut since (6,3) is an apple, moving down then right is a good plan.\n\n### Final Move:\n**LEFT**",

This is better than moving up or left because:\n- Moving up doesn't help us reach any apples quickly.\n- Moving left doesn't help us reach any apples quickly either.\n- Moving down sets us up to eat the apple at (6, 3) next turn, which is a high-value target (since it's closer and we can reach it quickly).\n\nAfter moving down to (4, 3), our body will be at (4, 4).

No immediate threats here (no snake or wall).\n2. **DOWN**: (5, 3) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (6, 3), but moving down to (5, 3) doesn't directly help unless we're planning to go right next turn.\n3. **LEFT**: (4, 4) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (4, 4), so moving left would allow us to eat the apple and grow.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 4) - This is within the board. There's no apple here, but moving right might be useful for future moves.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **UP (5, 5)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, opens up future moves towards other apples.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points (no apple at (5, 5)).\n\n2. **DOWN (5, 3)**:\n   - Pros: Closer to the apple at (6, 3), which could be reached next turn by moving right.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n3. **LEFT (4, 4)**:\n   - Pros: Directly eats the apple at (4, 4), gaining a point and growing.\n   - Cons: After eating, the snake's body will be at (5, 4), so next move must not go back to (5, 4) (which is already handled since the snake grows, and the body is at the previous head position).\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 4)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, could be useful for future moves.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe most immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (4, 4) by moving left. This gives us a point and grows our snake, which is always a good move in Snake. After eating, our body will be at (5, 4), and our head will be at (4, 4). Next turn, we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5, 4) (which would be right, but since we're growing, the body is at the previous head position, so moving right would be safe as long as we don't have a body there yet\u2014but actually, after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4), so moving right to (5,4) would collide with our own body, which is bad. Wait, no: when you move, the body follows the head's previous position. So after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4). Then if we move right from (4,4), we'd go to (5,4), which is our body\u2014this would kill us. So after moving left to eat the apple, we cannot move right next turn. But we can move up, down, or left (but left from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is safe unless there's a wall or snake there, which there isn't).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after eating at (4,4), where can we go next?\n- From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5) - safe\n  - DOWN: (4,3) - safe\n  - LEFT: (3,4) - safe\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - our body, so die. So cannot go right next turn.\n\nBut is there a better apple to go for next? The other apples are at (6,3), (0,8), (2,1), (6,1). From (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is adjacent to (6,3), so we could go down then right to (6,3). But (6,3) is two moves away, and we'd have to avoid our own body.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,5) puts us closer to (6,5) or (4,6), but no apples are up there immediately.\n\nMoving left to (3,4) is safe, but no immediate apples nearby.\n\nSo the immediate best move is to eat the apple at (4,4) by moving left. Then next turn, we can choose a direction that doesn't lead to our body. For example, after moving left to (4,4), we could move down to (4,3), then right to (6,3) to eat another apple.\n\nBut is there a better immediate move? Let's see if moving down to (5,3) is better. From (5,3), we can move right to (6,3) to eat the apple there. But this is two moves to eat an apple, whereas moving left to (4,4) eats an apple immediately.\n\nSo moving left is better for immediate gain.\n\n### Checking for Threats:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,9), far away from us. No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate move is to move **LEFT** to (4,4) to eat the apple there, gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nNext turn, from (4,4), we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5,4). Possible options:\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3) (then can go right to (6,3) next)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\nBut since (6,3) is an apple, moving down then right is a good plan.\n\n### Final Move:\n**LEFT**",

No immediate threats here (no snake or wall).\n2. **DOWN**: (5, 3) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (6, 3), but moving down to (5, 3) doesn't directly help unless we're planning to go right next turn.\n3. **LEFT**: (4, 4) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (4, 4), so moving left would allow us to eat the apple and grow.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 4) - This is within the board. There's no apple here, but moving right might be useful for future moves.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **UP (5, 5)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, opens up future moves towards other apples.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points (no apple at (5, 5)).\n\n2. **DOWN (5, 3)**:\n   - Pros: Closer to the apple at (6, 3), which could be reached next turn by moving right.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n3. **LEFT (4, 4)**:\n   - Pros: Directly eats the apple at (4, 4), gaining a point and growing.\n   - Cons: After eating, the snake's body will be at (5, 4), so next move must not go back to (5, 4) (which is already handled since the snake grows, and the body is at the previous head position).\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 4)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, could be useful for future moves.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe most immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (4, 4) by moving left. This gives us a point and grows our snake, which is always a good move in Snake. After eating, our body will be at (5, 4), and our head will be at (4, 4). Next turn, we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5, 4) (which would be right, but since we're growing, the body is at the previous head position, so moving right would be safe as long as we don't have a body there yet\u2014but actually, after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4), so moving right to (5,4) would collide with our own body, which is bad. Wait, no: when you move, the body follows the head's previous position. So after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4). Then if we move right from (4,4), we'd go to (5,4), which is our body\u2014this would kill us. So after moving left to eat the apple, we cannot move right next turn. But we can move up, down, or left (but left from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is safe unless there's a wall or snake there, which there isn't).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after eating at (4,4), where can we go next?\n- From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5) - safe\n  - DOWN: (4,3) - safe\n  - LEFT: (3,4) - safe\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - our body, so die. So cannot go right next turn.\n\nBut is there a better apple to go for next? The other apples are at (6,3), (0,8), (2,1), (6,1). From (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is adjacent to (6,3), so we could go down then right to (6,3). But (6,3) is two moves away, and we'd have to avoid our own body.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,5) puts us closer to (6,5) or (4,6), but no apples are up there immediately.\n\nMoving left to (3,4) is safe, but no immediate apples nearby.\n\nSo the immediate best move is to eat the apple at (4,4) by moving left. Then next turn, we can choose a direction that doesn't lead to our body. For example, after moving left to (4,4), we could move down to (4,3), then right to (6,3) to eat another apple.\n\nBut is there a better immediate move? Let's see if moving down to (5,3) is better. From (5,3), we can move right to (6,3) to eat the apple there. But this is two moves to eat an apple, whereas moving left to (4,4) eats an apple immediately.\n\nSo moving left is better for immediate gain.\n\n### Checking for Threats:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,9), far away from us. No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate move is to move **LEFT** to (4,4) to eat the apple there, gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nNext turn, from (4,4), we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5,4). Possible options:\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3) (then can go right to (6,3) next)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\nBut since (6,3) is an apple, moving down then right is a good plan.\n\n### Final Move:\n**LEFT**",

No immediate threats here (no snake or wall).\n2. **DOWN**: (5, 3) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (6, 3), but moving down to (5, 3) doesn't directly help unless we're planning to go right next turn.\n3. **LEFT**: (4, 4) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (4, 4), so moving left would allow us to eat the apple and grow.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 4) - This is within the board. There's no apple here, but moving right might be useful for future moves.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **UP (5, 5)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, opens up future moves towards other apples.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points (no apple at (5, 5)).\n\n2. **DOWN (5, 3)**:\n   - Pros: Closer to the apple at (6, 3), which could be reached next turn by moving right.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n3. **LEFT (4, 4)**:\n   - Pros: Directly eats the apple at (4, 4), gaining a point and growing.\n   - Cons: After eating, the snake's body will be at (5, 4), so next move must not go back to (5, 4) (which is already handled since the snake grows, and the body is at the previous head position).\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 4)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, could be useful for future moves.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe most immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (4, 4) by moving left. This gives us a point and grows our snake, which is always a good move in Snake. After eating, our body will be at (5, 4), and our head will be at (4, 4). Next turn, we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5, 4) (which would be right, but since we're growing, the body is at the previous head position, so moving right would be safe as long as we don't have a body there yet\u2014but actually, after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4), so moving right to (5,4) would collide with our own body, which is bad. Wait, no: when you move, the body follows the head's previous position. So after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4). Then if we move right from (4,4), we'd go to (5,4), which is our body\u2014this would kill us. So after moving left to eat the apple, we cannot move right next turn. But we can move up, down, or left (but left from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is safe unless there's a wall or snake there, which there isn't).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after eating at (4,4), where can we go next?\n- From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5) - safe\n  - DOWN: (4,3) - safe\n  - LEFT: (3,4) - safe\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - our body, so die. So cannot go right next turn.\n\nBut is there a better apple to go for next? The other apples are at (6,3), (0,8), (2,1), (6,1). From (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is adjacent to (6,3), so we could go down then right to (6,3). But (6,3) is two moves away, and we'd have to avoid our own body.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,5) puts us closer to (6,5) or (4,6), but no apples are up there immediately.\n\nMoving left to (3,4) is safe, but no immediate apples nearby.\n\nSo the immediate best move is to eat the apple at (4,4) by moving left. Then next turn, we can choose a direction that doesn't lead to our body. For example, after moving left to (4,4), we could move down to (4,3), then right to (6,3) to eat another apple.\n\nBut is there a better immediate move? Let's see if moving down to (5,3) is better. From (5,3), we can move right to (6,3) to eat the apple there. But this is two moves to eat an apple, whereas moving left to (4,4) eats an apple immediately.\n\nSo moving left is better for immediate gain.\n\n### Checking for Threats:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,9), far away from us. No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate move is to move **LEFT** to (4,4) to eat the apple there, gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nNext turn, from (4,4), we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5,4). Possible options:\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3) (then can go right to (6,3) next)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\nBut since (6,3) is an apple, moving down then right is a good plan.\n\n### Final Move:\n**LEFT**",

Moving here would kill us, so this is invalid.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **UP (4, 5)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, opens up future moves towards other apples (e.g., (1, 7) is far but could be a target).\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points (no apple at (4, 5)).\n\n2. **DOWN (4, 3)**:\n   - Pros: Moves closer to the apple at (6, 3).

This positions us to reach the apple at (6, 3) in two moves (right twice). This is better than moving up or left because:\n- Moving up doesn't help us reach any apples quickly.\n- Moving left doesn't help us reach any apples quickly either.\n- Moving down sets us up to eat the apple at (6, 3) next turn, which is a high-value target (since it's closer and we can reach it quickly).\n\nAfter moving down to (4, 3), our body will be at (4, 4).

No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is to move **DOWN** to (4, 3), setting up to eat the apple at (6, 3) next turn.\n\n### Next Turn Strategy:\nAfter moving down to (4, 3), the next move should be **RIGHT** to (5, 3).

No immediate threats here (no snake or wall).\n2. **DOWN**: (5, 3) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (6, 3), but moving down to (5, 3) doesn't directly help unless we're planning to go right next turn.\n3. **LEFT**: (4, 4) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (4, 4), so moving left would allow us to eat the apple and grow.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 4) - This is within the board. There's no apple here, but moving right might be useful for future moves.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **UP (5, 5)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, opens up future moves towards other apples.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points (no apple at (5, 5)).\n\n2. **DOWN (5, 3)**:\n   - Pros: Closer to the apple at (6, 3), which could be reached next turn by moving right.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n3. **LEFT (4, 4)**:\n   - Pros: Directly eats the apple at (4, 4), gaining a point and growing.\n   - Cons: After eating, the snake's body will be at (5, 4), so next move must not go back to (5, 4) (which is already handled since the snake grows, and the body is at the previous head position).\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 4)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, could be useful for future moves.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe most immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (4, 4) by moving left. This gives us a point and grows our snake, which is always a good move in Snake. After eating, our body will be at (5, 4), and our head will be at (4, 4). Next turn, we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5, 4) (which would be right, but since we're growing, the body is at the previous head position, so moving right would be safe as long as we don't have a body there yet\u2014but actually, after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4), so moving right to (5,4) would collide with our own body, which is bad. Wait, no: when you move, the body follows the head's previous position. So after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4). Then if we move right from (4,4), we'd go to (5,4), which is our body\u2014this would kill us. So after moving left to eat the apple, we cannot move right next turn. But we can move up, down, or left (but left from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is safe unless there's a wall or snake there, which there isn't).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after eating at (4,4), where can we go next?\n- From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5) - safe\n  - DOWN: (4,3) - safe\n  - LEFT: (3,4) - safe\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - our body, so die. So cannot go right next turn.\n\nBut is there a better apple to go for next? The other apples are at (6,3), (0,8), (2,1), (6,1). From (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is adjacent to (6,3), so we could go down then right to (6,3). But (6,3) is two moves away, and we'd have to avoid our own body.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,5) puts us closer to (6,5) or (4,6), but no apples are up there immediately.\n\nMoving left to (3,4) is safe, but no immediate apples nearby.\n\nSo the immediate best move is to eat the apple at (4,4) by moving left. Then next turn, we can choose a direction that doesn't lead to our body. For example, after moving left to (4,4), we could move down to (4,3), then right to (6,3) to eat another apple.\n\nBut is there a better immediate move? Let's see if moving down to (5,3) is better. From (5,3), we can move right to (6,3) to eat the apple there. But this is two moves to eat an apple, whereas moving left to (4,4) eats an apple immediately.\n\nSo moving left is better for immediate gain.\n\n### Checking for Threats:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,9), far away from us. No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate move is to move **LEFT** to (4,4) to eat the apple there, gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nNext turn, from (4,4), we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5,4). Possible options:\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3) (then can go right to (6,3) next)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\nBut since (6,3) is an apple, moving down then right is a good plan.\n\n### Final Move:\n**LEFT**",

We should use this opportunity to position ourselves favorably for the next moves.\n\nOur snake's head is at (2, 6), and we have an apple directly below us at (2, 1). The direct path downward is currently clear, but we must consider the enemy snake's potential moves.

No immediate threats here (no snake or wall).\n2. **DOWN**: (5, 3) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (6, 3), but moving down to (5, 3) doesn't directly help unless we're planning to go right next turn.\n3. **LEFT**: (4, 4) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (4, 4), so moving left would allow us to eat the apple and grow.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 4) - This is within the board. There's no apple here, but moving right might be useful for future moves.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **UP (5, 5)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, opens up future moves towards other apples.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points (no apple at (5, 5)).\n\n2. **DOWN (5, 3)**:\n   - Pros: Closer to the apple at (6, 3), which could be reached next turn by moving right.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n3. **LEFT (4, 4)**:\n   - Pros: Directly eats the apple at (4, 4), gaining a point and growing.\n   - Cons: After eating, the snake's body will be at (5, 4), so next move must not go back to (5, 4) (which is already handled since the snake grows, and the body is at the previous head position).\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 4)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, could be useful for future moves.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe most immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (4, 4) by moving left. This gives us a point and grows our snake, which is always a good move in Snake. After eating, our body will be at (5, 4), and our head will be at (4, 4). Next turn, we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5, 4) (which would be right, but since we're growing, the body is at the previous head position, so moving right would be safe as long as we don't have a body there yet\u2014but actually, after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4), so moving right to (5,4) would collide with our own body, which is bad. Wait, no: when you move, the body follows the head's previous position. So after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4). Then if we move right from (4,4), we'd go to (5,4), which is our body\u2014this would kill us. So after moving left to eat the apple, we cannot move right next turn. But we can move up, down, or left (but left from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is safe unless there's a wall or snake there, which there isn't).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after eating at (4,4), where can we go next?\n- From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5) - safe\n  - DOWN: (4,3) - safe\n  - LEFT: (3,4) - safe\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - our body, so die. So cannot go right next turn.\n\nBut is there a better apple to go for next? The other apples are at (6,3), (0,8), (2,1), (6,1). From (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is adjacent to (6,3), so we could go down then right to (6,3). But (6,3) is two moves away, and we'd have to avoid our own body.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,5) puts us closer to (6,5) or (4,6), but no apples are up there immediately.\n\nMoving left to (3,4) is safe, but no immediate apples nearby.\n\nSo the immediate best move is to eat the apple at (4,4) by moving left. Then next turn, we can choose a direction that doesn't lead to our body. For example, after moving left to (4,4), we could move down to (4,3), then right to (6,3) to eat another apple.\n\nBut is there a better immediate move? Let's see if moving down to (5,3) is better. From (5,3), we can move right to (6,3) to eat the apple there. But this is two moves to eat an apple, whereas moving left to (4,4) eats an apple immediately.\n\nSo moving left is better for immediate gain.\n\n### Checking for Threats:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,9), far away from us. No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate move is to move **LEFT** to (4,4) to eat the apple there, gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nNext turn, from (4,4), we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5,4). Possible options:\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3) (then can go right to (6,3) next)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\nBut since (6,3) is an apple, moving down then right is a good plan.\n\n### Final Move:\n**LEFT**",

No immediate threats here (no snake or wall).\n2. **DOWN**: (5, 3) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (6, 3), but moving down to (5, 3) doesn't directly help unless we're planning to go right next turn.\n3. **LEFT**: (4, 4) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (4, 4), so moving left would allow us to eat the apple and grow.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 4) - This is within the board. There's no apple here, but moving right might be useful for future moves.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **UP (5, 5)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, opens up future moves towards other apples.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points (no apple at (5, 5)).\n\n2. **DOWN (5, 3)**:\n   - Pros: Closer to the apple at (6, 3), which could be reached next turn by moving right.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n3. **LEFT (4, 4)**:\n   - Pros: Directly eats the apple at (4, 4), gaining a point and growing.\n   - Cons: After eating, the snake's body will be at (5, 4), so next move must not go back to (5, 4) (which is already handled since the snake grows, and the body is at the previous head position).\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 4)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, could be useful for future moves.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe most immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (4, 4) by moving left. This gives us a point and grows our snake, which is always a good move in Snake. After eating, our body will be at (5, 4), and our head will be at (4, 4). Next turn, we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5, 4) (which would be right, but since we're growing, the body is at the previous head position, so moving right would be safe as long as we don't have a body there yet\u2014but actually, after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4), so moving right to (5,4) would collide with our own body, which is bad. Wait, no: when you move, the body follows the head's previous position. So after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4). Then if we move right from (4,4), we'd go to (5,4), which is our body\u2014this would kill us. So after moving left to eat the apple, we cannot move right next turn. But we can move up, down, or left (but left from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is safe unless there's a wall or snake there, which there isn't).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after eating at (4,4), where can we go next?\n- From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5) - safe\n  - DOWN: (4,3) - safe\n  - LEFT: (3,4) - safe\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - our body, so die. So cannot go right next turn.\n\nBut is there a better apple to go for next? The other apples are at (6,3), (0,8), (2,1), (6,1). From (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is adjacent to (6,3), so we could go down then right to (6,3). But (6,3) is two moves away, and we'd have to avoid our own body.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,5) puts us closer to (6,5) or (4,6), but no apples are up there immediately.\n\nMoving left to (3,4) is safe, but no immediate apples nearby.\n\nSo the immediate best move is to eat the apple at (4,4) by moving left. Then next turn, we can choose a direction that doesn't lead to our body. For example, after moving left to (4,4), we could move down to (4,3), then right to (6,3) to eat another apple.\n\nBut is there a better immediate move? Let's see if moving down to (5,3) is better. From (5,3), we can move right to (6,3) to eat the apple there. But this is two moves to eat an apple, whereas moving left to (4,4) eats an apple immediately.\n\nSo moving left is better for immediate gain.\n\n### Checking for Threats:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,9), far away from us. No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate move is to move **LEFT** to (4,4) to eat the apple there, gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nNext turn, from (4,4), we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5,4). Possible options:\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3) (then can go right to (6,3) next)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\nBut since (6,3) is an apple, moving down then right is a good plan.\n\n### Final Move:\n**LEFT**",

Next turn, we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5, 4) (which would be right, but since we're growing, the body is at the previous head position, so moving right would be safe as long as we don't have a body there yet\u2014but actually, after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4), so moving right to (5,4) would collide with our own body, which is bad. Wait, no: when you move, the body follows the head's previous position. So after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4). Then if we move right from (4,4), we'd go to (5,4), which is our body\u2014this would kill us. So after moving left to eat the apple, we cannot move right next turn. But we can move up, down, or left (but left from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is safe unless there's a wall or snake there, which there isn't).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after eating at (4,4), where can we go next?\n- From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5) - safe\n  - DOWN: (4,3) - safe\n  - LEFT: (3,4) - safe\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - our body, so die. So cannot go right next turn.\n\nBut is there a better apple to go for next? The other apples are at (6,3), (0,8), (2,1), (6,1). From (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is adjacent to (6,3), so we could go down then right to (6,3). But (6,3) is two moves away, and we'd have to avoid our own body.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,5) puts us closer to (6,5) or (4,6), but no apples are up there immediately.\n\nMoving left to (3,4) is safe, but no immediate apples nearby.\n\nSo the immediate best move is to eat the apple at (4,4) by moving left. Then next turn, we can choose a direction that doesn't lead to our body. For example, after moving left to (4,4), we could move down to (4,3), then right to (6,3) to eat another apple.\n\nBut is there a better immediate move? Let's see if moving down to (5,3) is better. From (5,3), we can move right to (6,3) to eat the apple there. But this is two moves to eat an apple, whereas moving left to (4,4) eats an apple immediately.\n\nSo moving left is better for immediate gain.\n\n### Checking for Threats:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,9), far away from us. No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate move is to move **LEFT** to (4,4) to eat the apple there, gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nNext turn, from (4,4), we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5,4). Possible options:\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3) (then can go right to (6,3) next)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\nBut since (6,3) is an apple, moving down then right is a good plan.\n\n### Final Move:\n**LEFT**",

We should use this opportunity to position ourselves favorably for the next moves.\n\nOur snake's head is at (2, 6), and we have an apple directly below us at (2, 1). The direct path downward is currently clear, but we must consider the enemy snake's potential moves. If the enemy snake moves down to (5, 5) and then right to (6, 5), we would be safe to move down at least twice to (2, 4) before needing to reassess the situation.\n\nMoving down to (2, 5) and then (2, 4) would put us in a good position to either continue down towards the apple or change direction if the enemy snake's movements necessitate it. By moving down twice, we also avoid moving in sync with the enemy snake, which reduces the risk of a collision.\n\nTherefore, the plan for the next two moves is:\n1. Move down to (2, 5).\n2. Move down to (2, 4).\n\nAfter these moves, we will be able to see the enemy snake's next move and adjust our strategy accordingly.

This gives us a point and grows our snake, which is always a good move in Snake. After eating, our body will be at (5, 4), and our head will be at (4, 4). Next turn, we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5, 4) (which would be right, but since we're growing, the body is at the previous head position, so moving right would be safe as long as we don't have a body there yet\u2014but actually, after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4), so moving right to (5,4) would collide with our own body, which is bad. Wait, no: when you move, the body follows the head's previous position. So after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4). Then if we move right from (4,4), we'd go to (5,4), which is our body\u2014this would kill us. So after moving left to eat the apple, we cannot move right next turn. But we can move up, down, or left (but left from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is safe unless there's a wall or snake there, which there isn't).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after eating at (4,4), where can we go next?\n- From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5) - safe\n  - DOWN: (4,3) - safe\n  - LEFT: (3,4) - safe\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - our body, so die. So cannot go right next turn.\n\nBut is there a better apple to go for next? The other apples are at (6,3), (0,8), (2,1), (6,1). From (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is adjacent to (6,3), so we could go down then right to (6,3). But (6,3) is two moves away, and we'd have to avoid our own body.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,5) puts us closer to (6,5) or (4,6), but no apples are up there immediately.\n\nMoving left to (3,4) is safe, but no immediate apples nearby.\n\nSo the immediate best move is to eat the apple at (4,4) by moving left. Then next turn, we can choose a direction that doesn't lead to our body. For example, after moving left to (4,4), we could move down to (4,3), then right to (6,3) to eat another apple.\n\nBut is there a better immediate move? Let's see if moving down to (5,3) is better. From (5,3), we can move right to (6,3) to eat the apple there. But this is two moves to eat an apple, whereas moving left to (4,4) eats an apple immediately.\n\nSo moving left is better for immediate gain.\n\n### Checking for Threats:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,9), far away from us. No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate move is to move **LEFT** to (4,4) to eat the apple there, gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nNext turn, from (4,4), we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5,4). Possible options:\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3) (then can go right to (6,3) next)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\nBut since (6,3) is an apple, moving down then right is a good plan.\n\n### Final Move:\n**LEFT**",

We are currently aligned with the enemy snake horizontally, so we need to be cautious not to descend at the same pace to avoid a collision.\n\nThe enemy snake is two moves away from the apple at (5, 6), and it's likely that it will collect this apple shortly. We should use this opportunity to position ourselves favorably for the next moves.\n\nOur snake's head is at (2, 6), and we have an apple directly below us at (2, 1). The direct path downward is currently clear, but we must consider the enemy snake's potential moves.

By moving down twice, we also avoid moving in sync with the enemy snake, which reduces the risk of a collision.\n\nTherefore, the plan for the next two moves is:\n1. Move down to (2, 5).\n2.

No immediate threats here (no snake or wall).\n2. **DOWN**: (5, 3) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (6, 3), but moving down to (5, 3) doesn't directly help unless we're planning to go right next turn.\n3. **LEFT**: (4, 4) - This is within the board. There's an apple at (4, 4), so moving left would allow us to eat the apple and grow.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 4) - This is within the board. There's no apple here, but moving right might be useful for future moves.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **UP (5, 5)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, opens up future moves towards other apples.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points (no apple at (5, 5)).\n\n2. **DOWN (5, 3)**:\n   - Pros: Closer to the apple at (6, 3), which could be reached next turn by moving right.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n3. **LEFT (4, 4)**:\n   - Pros: Directly eats the apple at (4, 4), gaining a point and growing.\n   - Cons: After eating, the snake's body will be at (5, 4), so next move must not go back to (5, 4) (which is already handled since the snake grows, and the body is at the previous head position).\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 4)**:\n   - Pros: No immediate threats, could be useful for future moves.\n   - Cons: Doesn't immediately gain points.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe most immediate benefit is to eat the apple at (4, 4) by moving left. This gives us a point and grows our snake, which is always a good move in Snake. After eating, our body will be at (5, 4), and our head will be at (4, 4). Next turn, we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5, 4) (which would be right, but since we're growing, the body is at the previous head position, so moving right would be safe as long as we don't have a body there yet\u2014but actually, after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4), so moving right to (5,4) would collide with our own body, which is bad. Wait, no: when you move, the body follows the head's previous position. So after moving left to (4,4), the body is at (5,4). Then if we move right from (4,4), we'd go to (5,4), which is our body\u2014this would kill us. So after moving left to eat the apple, we cannot move right next turn. But we can move up, down, or left (but left from (4,4) would be (3,4), which is safe unless there's a wall or snake there, which there isn't).\n\nBut let's think ahead: after eating at (4,4), where can we go next?\n- From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5) - safe\n  - DOWN: (4,3) - safe\n  - LEFT: (3,4) - safe\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - our body, so die. So cannot go right next turn.\n\nBut is there a better apple to go for next? The other apples are at (6,3), (0,8), (2,1), (6,1). From (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is adjacent to (6,3), so we could go down then right to (6,3). But (6,3) is two moves away, and we'd have to avoid our own body.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,5) puts us closer to (6,5) or (4,6), but no apples are up there immediately.\n\nMoving left to (3,4) is safe, but no immediate apples nearby.\n\nSo the immediate best move is to eat the apple at (4,4) by moving left. Then next turn, we can choose a direction that doesn't lead to our body. For example, after moving left to (4,4), we could move down to (4,3), then right to (6,3) to eat another apple.\n\nBut is there a better immediate move? Let's see if moving down to (5,3) is better. From (5,3), we can move right to (6,3) to eat the apple there. But this is two moves to eat an apple, whereas moving left to (4,4) eats an apple immediately.\n\nSo moving left is better for immediate gain.\n\n### Checking for Threats:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,9), far away from us. No immediate threat.\n- No walls are adjacent to our current position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate move is to move **LEFT** to (4,4) to eat the apple there, gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nNext turn, from (4,4), we'll need to choose a direction that doesn't go back to (5,4). Possible options:\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3) (then can go right to (6,3) next)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\nBut since (6,3) is an apple, moving down then right is a good plan.\n\n### Final Move:\n**LEFT**",

            "rationale": "Given the current board state and the last move information, the snake successfully collected the apple at (2, 1) by moving down from (2, 2). The next move was intended to be RIGHT, to move towards the apple at (3, 0). However, the snake's head is currently at (4, 3), and moving right would not lead to the collection of the apple at (3, 0) but rather move the snake horizontally along the row at y=3.\n\nTo correct the strategy, we need to move UP to collect the apple at (3, 0), not right. This is because the apple is directly above the snake's head at (4, 3), and moving up will allow the snake to collect it.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (3, 0), the snake will have to make a decision on where to go next. The enemy snake #0 is currently moving horizontally towards the apples at (5, 6) and potentially (3, 4) and (2, 8) afterward. To avoid a confrontation and to ensure a safe path, the snake should aim for the apple at (2, 8) after collecting the one at (3, 0). This is because the apple at (5, 6) is in the path of the enemy snake and may lead to a collision or a high-risk situation.\n\nHere's the updated strategy:\n1. Move UP to collect the apple at (3, 0).\n2. After collecting the apple, turn left to move towards the apple at (2, 8), which is a safer option.\n3. Continue to avoid the enemy snake's trajectory and be mindful of the walls and the snake's own body.\n\n**NEXT MOVE:** UP (to collect the apple at (3, 0))\n\n**NEXT TURN STRATEGY:** After collecting the apple at (3, 0), turn left to move towards the safer apple at (2, 8). Always keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements and adjust the strategy accordingly to prevent any collisions.",
