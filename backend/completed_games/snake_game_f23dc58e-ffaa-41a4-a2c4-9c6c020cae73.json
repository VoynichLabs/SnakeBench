Hence, my new updated snake positions from head to tail are:\n[(4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)] \u2014 and importantly last segment (tail) at (2,3) did NOT disappear this turn since we consumed an apple.\n\nImmediate adjacent squares from my current head position (4,0):\n- RIGHT to (5,0): Safe and open.\n- LEFT back to (3,0): Unsafe because occupied by my own body. Avoid.\n- UP to (4,1): Clearly safe and open; no immediate threats.\n- DOWN moves off the board, unsafe.\n\nStrategically assessing apples clearly:\n- Closest apple next at (7,0): clearly reachable by moving horizontally RIGHT.\n- Other apples located further up on the board at (7,2), (2,5), (6,9), and (3,7) remain good secondary targets after this immediate objective.\n\nClear, optimal immediate direction:\n- The clear next immediate direction to continue toward the next apple at (7,0) is RIGHT. It's safe, open, moves directly toward the next apple, and poses no immediate risk.\n\nNext-turn strategy reminder:\n- After moving RIGHT at (5,0), continue moving horizontally RIGHT toward apple (7,0).\n\nDecided move: RIGHT"

However, it does not progress toward an apple directly.\n- **DOWN to (6, 3)**: Also leads to an empty space and keeps options open, but again does not get closer to apples.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 4)**: This move is towards the right, but it still keeps me away from the immediate threat of the enemy snake, allowing me more future options. However, it may be a bit away from apples as I'm not really advancing in that direction.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\n- The available options UP, DOWN, and RIGHT all allow for movement without immediate danger from running into walls or my own body.\n- Moving UP to (6, 5) gives me more options for subsequent moves next turn, potentially to get closer to future apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 4) keeps me out of enemy territory but doesn't serve to advance toward the apples especially since they are in (7, 2) which is further down below.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter reviewing the options, although RIGHT and UP both seem appealing to maneuver further, UP to (6, 5) seems a more strategic choice to give myself better positioning to move toward the apple on the next turn.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

To avoid getting trapped, I must remain aware of their movement\u2014however, left movement currently places me at (6,4), still safely distant from enemy\u2019s immediate positions.\n- Enemy snake unlikely able to directly cut off my planned upward route quickly, giving me some time if I act decisively upwards after this turn.\n\nClear choice this turn:\n- LEFT clearly preferable, moves directly closer to my targeted apple at (6,9) and sets me up for a clear path upwards.\n\nStrategy to remember for next turn:\n- After moving LEFT (to 6,4), aim to move UP continually towards apple at (6,9), carefully checking at each step for enemy snake\u2019s movements, my own body\u2019s position, and any newly emerging threats.\n\nFinal Decision: LEFT"

Be prepared to adjust your path if enemy snake attempts interference around the apple area.\n\nFinal Decision: UP"

Need to keep an eye on positions (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), and (5,5), remaining vigilant of snake #2's next moves.\n\nPath Planning and Long-term Strategic Choice:\n- The optimal strategy of going upward toward apple (6,9) remains viable and still the safest immediate path.\n- Continuing upward (6,6) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 (6,8) \u2192 (6,9) remains an optimal choice given the current board state.\n\nStrategy Reminder for upcoming turns:\n- Continuously evaluate moves of enemy snake #2 during the next few turns, making sure that snake #2 does not cut off access or trap the snake.\n- Still target apple at (6,9) as your priority.\n- Remain flexible\u2014if snake #2 moves to block or interfere above, consider rightward or careful lateral shifts if needed.\n\nClear Decision this turn:\n- The best move is clearly UP for now, maintaining both safety and strategy consistency.\n\nFinal Decision: UP"
