If we go RIGHT, we\u2019re heading straight for that cluster of apples at (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 4), and (4, 5). Moving RIGHT puts us in the lane to intercept his path if he tries to cross the board. We need to grow FAST so we can body-block him later. If we get long enough, he's going to have nowhere to run! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udeab\n\nLet's take the space! We're going RIGHT to claim the center and start the hunt! Can he even handle this pressure?! I don't think so!\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** \nI'm going to head towards (1, 4) and (1, 3) to pick up those early gains, then pivot to the (4, 4) cluster to create a wall.

What is he even doing down there?! Hugging the wall? Low energy! \ud83e\udd71\n\nWe are currently at (1, 5). Let's look at the board and the juice!\n\n**LEGAL MOVES:**\n- **UP:** Moves us to (1, 6). Totally safe! \n- **DOWN:** Moves us to (1, 4). YO! There is an apple right there at (1, 4). If we take this, we grow and start the scoreboard! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n- **RIGHT:** Moves us to (2, 5). Safe, but we miss the immediate snack.\n- **LEFT:** Moves us back to (0, 5). That's backwards into our tail/path? Wait, we have no body segments yet, but it's backtracking. We want to move forward, not backward!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nOur opponent is all the way across the map at (8, 0). He's literally as far away as possible. This is our chance to feast and set up the TRAP! There's a vertical line of snacks right under us at (1, 4) and (1, 3). If we grab those, we get longer and stronger. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRemember the plan, chat: GROW to DOMINATE. If we hit (1, 4) now, we\u2019re one step closer to the (4, 4) cluster where we can build a massive wall. He's going to try to come up for air eventually, and when he does, we\u2019re going to be a 10-ton beast waiting to box him in! \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udeab\n\nWhy would I go anywhere else? DOWN leads directly to points. Points lead to growth. Growth leads to him crashing into our thick tail! Let's secure the bag! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:**\nI'm grabbing (1, 4) this turn, then (1, 3) next turn. After that, I\u2019m cutting RIGHT across the middle (x-axis) to get to those (4, 4) and (5, 4) apples. By the time he realizes he needs to compete for the center, I\u2019ll already have the territory locked down! Stay focused, stay hungry! \ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Apples everywhere but ignore 'em for now \u2014 we need to establish dominance early.\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- UP \u2192 (8,1) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 off board (8,-1) \u274c INSTANT DEATH.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,0) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 off board (10,0) \u274c INSTANT DEATH.\n\nSo only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** Enemy at (1,5) can go UP to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4), LEFT to (0,5), RIGHT to (2,5). All safe for him currently. He might go for the apple at (1,4) or (1,3). Hard to read.\n\n**Long-term plan:** We gotta expand toward the center and cut off his movement options. Right now we're in the bottom right corner \u2014 moving UP opens more future moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT next turn). Moving LEFT keeps us along bottom edge, limiting options. Better to move into open space early.\n\n**Decision:** UP gives more flexibility, gets us closer to central control. LEFT traps us against the edge. We play aggressive but smart \u2014 UP sets up future pressure.\n\n**Final move:**\nUP",

If we go down, we hit 2 points before he even gets 1! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- **LEFT:** (0, 4). Safe, but we move away from the snacks. Why go to the wall when the food is right here?\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 4). Safe, moves us toward the center cluster near (4, 4), but we'd miss the immediate snack at (1, 3).\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nChat, the strategy is simple: **STAY FED, STAY THICK.**\nI\u2019m grabbing the apple at (1, 3) right now. That puts us at a score of 2. After that, look at the heat map\u2014there\u2019s a massive cluster of apples at (4, 4), (5, 4), (4, 5), and (5, 5). That is the promised land! \ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf4e\n\nOnce I grab (1, 3), I\u2019m going to pivot RIGHT and head straight for that central buffet. Snake #1 is at (8, 1). If he tries to come for our apples, he has to travel further than we do. We\u2019re going to get there first, grow long, and then we\u2019re going to COIL. We\u2019ll create a wall of segments that he can\u2019t cross. He\u2019ll be forced to the edges while we own the middle of the map!\n\nHe thinks he's safe at (8, 1)? Keep dreaming, buddy! We're building a fortress! \ud83c\udff0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:**\nGrab (1, 3) this turn. Next turn, we start the trek RIGHT towards the (4, 4) cluster. We are going to prioritize those central apples to make sure he can't get a foothold. If he tries to head-butt us, remember: we have the higher score! We win the tie-break if we both go down, but we aren't going down. We're going UP! (Well, down first, then up to the top of the leaderboard!)\n\nLET'S GET THAT SECOND APPLE! LETS GOOOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

Our body is currently just the head, so no tail behind us yet. Enemy snake #0 head at **(1,4)** with body at **(1,5)**. He has 1 apple, we have 0 \u2014 so he's longer. Head-on collision right now would kill us both, but he'd win on score. Avoid that!\n\n**Possible moves from (8,1):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,2) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,0) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,1) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,1) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nAll four directions are safe immediately! Good.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** Enemy at (1,4) with body at (1,5) behind him. He CANNOT go UP into (1,5) \u2014 that's his own body! \u274c So his safe moves: DOWN to (1,3), LEFT to (0,4), RIGHT to (2,4). He might go for apple at (1,3) or (4,4) eventually.\n\n**Our strategy:** We need to **grow** and **cut off his space**. Right now we\u2019re near bottom-right. Moving toward the center gives more options. Also, we want to avoid walking into his potential path if he\u2019s coming down.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Start wrapping around the board edges to limit his movement, then push him into a corner. We should grab an apple soon to match his length, then force a head-on when we\u2019re longer.\n\n**Which move best?**\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,2) \u2014 opens future UP/LEFT/RIGHT, good central progress.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,0) \u2014 keeps us on bottom edge, limits options.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,1) \u2014 moves us left, but still low.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,1) \u2014 pins us to right edge.\n\nBest for future flexibility and central control: **UP** or **LEFT**.  \nUP gets us closer to apples like (8,9) long-term, LEFT gets us toward center faster.  \nLet's pick **UP** \u2014 it also keeps distance from enemy currently moving possibly downward.\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Safe, but we just came from there? Actually our body is \"none\" so it's fine, but no apple.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DEATH CHECK:** All moves are on-board. No body to crash into. Enemy body is at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,2)? Wait, his head is at (1,2), body is [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]? Actually looking at board: Snake #0 head at (1,2), body at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)? That means his tail is at (1,5)? That's weird ordering but okay. So (1,2) is his head, (1,3) is his neck, etc. So enemy body cells are far away. NO immediate crash risk from current positions.\n\n**BUT SIMULTANEOOUS MOVE RISK!** Enemy head at (1,2). Where can he go?\n- UP to (1,3) \u2192 into his own body? YES, that's his neck! \u274c NOT ALLOWED.\n- DOWN to (1,1) \u2192 empty, safe.\n- LEFT to (0,2) \u2192 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT to (2,2) \u2192 empty, safe.\n\nSo enemy likely avoids UP. He might go for apple at (4,1)? Or (3,3)? He's far. **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** If we go UP to (7,3), can he reach (7,3) in one move? NO, he's at (1,2). Impossible. So no direct head-on this turn.\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:** Apple at (7,3) is ONE MOVE AWAY! Eating it grows us to length 2, matching his *body length*? Actually he has 3 apples, so length 4 total (head + 3 body). We'd be length 2. Still behind but catching up!\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS:** If we eat apple at (7,3), our body will be at (7,2). Next turn from (7,3), safe moves? UP to (7,4), DOWN to (7,2) (into our new body? Wait, body at (7,2) would be our tail? Actually after eating, our tail stays at original tail? We have no tail yet, so after eating, our body becomes [(7,3), (7,2)]? Actually head moves to (7,3), new segment added at old head position (7,2). So body is at (7,2). So DOWN from (7,3) would go into our own body at (7,2) \u274c NOT ALLOWED next turn. So eating the apple TRAPS us from going DOWN next turn. But we'd have UP, LEFT, RIGHT open.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE:** If we go LEFT to (6,2), we're closer to center, can maybe target apple at (5,5) or (4,5) later. But delaying growth against a length-4 enemy is RISKY! We need to grow ASAP to compete for space.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** He might go DOWN to (1,1) toward apple at (4,1)? Or RIGHT to (2,2). Either way, he's not threatening us yet.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** GRAB THAT APPLE NOW! Grow to length 2. Then use our new length to start controlling more board. Maybe push toward (7,5) or (5,6) apples. Once we're longer, we can think about boxing him in the top-left where he is.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:** All moves safe this turn. But UP gives us growth AND central position. DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT are safe but no growth.\n\n**DECISION:** UP! GET THAT APPLE, START SNOWBALLING! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

He just snagged one at (7, 3), but look at us\u2014we\u2019re positioned perfectly to take over the entire board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nWe are at (2, 2). Our body is trailing behind us at (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4). Snake #1 is sitting at (7, 3) with his tail at (7, 2). He thinks he's safe over there in the corner? NOT ON MY WATCH!\n\n**THE CHAT-SENSORY ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP:** (2, 3). This is wide open! It puts us one step closer to that JUICY apple at (3, 3). We love content! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **DOWN:** (1, 1). Why would we go back down toward the corner? We need to stay in the action!\n- **LEFT:** (1, 2). NO! That's my own body! We aren't throwing the lead for a fail clip! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT:** (3, 2). This is also safe and moves us toward the center, but (2, 3) feels more aggressive for the (3, 3) apple.\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (7, 3). If we move UP to (2, 3), we are positioning ourselves to snag (3, 3) on the next turn. More importantly, we are staying tall. Look at all those apples in the middle: (4, 4), (5, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5). If we take the \"high ground\" now, we can sweep across the middle and create a massive wall that he can't cross! \ud83e\uddf1\n\nHe\u2019s only length 2. We are length 4. If he tries to come toward the middle, we catch him and squeeze him against the wall. He's playing checkers; we're playing 4D Snake!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n1. Move UP to (2, 3) to setup the grab at (3, 3).\n2. After (3, 3), we pivot RIGHT toward the cluster at (4, 4) and (5, 4).\n3. We are going to build a horizontal fence across the 4th/5th row. If he wants to eat, he has to go through US.\n4. Keep the score lead! If we stay ahead in apples, even a double-crash wins us the game! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nLet's go, Chat! Don't let him breathe!

Enemy is still length 4, head at (2,2), with 3 apples. Score is 1 vs 3\u2014we're catching up! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (7,3):**\n- **UP \u2192 (7,4)**: Board shows empty? Looking at board: (7,4) is a `.` \u2705 Safe.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,2)**: That's our OWN BODY segment! \u274c **CRASH INTO SELF, INSTANT DEATH.** Eliminated!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,3)**: Empty `.` \u2705 Safe.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,3)**: Empty `.` \u2705 Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is **OUT**. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are possible.\n\n**SIMULTANEOUS MOVE RISK \u2013 ENEMY HEAD AT (2,2):**\nWhere can he go?\n- UP to (2,3): Empty `.` \u2705\n- DOWN to (2,1): Empty `.` \u2705\n- LEFT to (1,2): That's his NECK? Wait, his body is [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]? Actually last turn his head was (1,2)? No, CURRENT board shows Snake #0 head at (2,2), body: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]. So (1,2) is his BODY (segment right behind head). So LEFT to (1,2) is **INTO HIS OWN BODY** \u274c Not allowed for him!\n- RIGHT to (3,2): Empty `.` \u2705\n\nSo enemy likely avoids LEFT. He might go UP toward apple at (3,3)? Or RIGHT toward (4,4) apple? Or DOWN toward (4,1) apple?\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (7,4), can enemy reach (7,4)? NO, he's 5 cells away. Impossible.\nIf we go LEFT to (6,3), enemy would need to go to (6,3) from (2,2)\u2014impossible.\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,3), also impossible.\nSo **NO DIRECT HEAD-ON COLLISION POSSIBLE THIS TURN**. Good.\n\n**APPLE PROXIMITY:**\n- Apple at (7,5) is 2 moves away (UP then UP).\n- Apple at (5,6) is further.\n- Apple at (4,4) is closer but enemy might be heading there.\nWe need to grow FAST to match his length! But also don't trap ourselves.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY & TRAPS:**\nIf we go UP to (7,4):\n- Next turn from (7,4), body at (7,3), (7,2).\n- Possible moves: UP to (7,5) apple? \u2705, LEFT to (6,4) \u2705, RIGHT to (8,4) apple? \u2705, DOWN to (7,3) body \u274c.\nSo 3 safe options, good flexibility.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (6,3):\n- Next turn body at (7,3), (7,2).\n- Possible moves: UP to (6,4) \u2705, DOWN to (6,2) \u2705, LEFT to (5,3) \u2705, RIGHT to (7,3) body \u274c.\nAlso 3 safe options.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,3):\n- Next turn body at (7,3), (7,2).\n- Possible moves: UP to (8,4) apple? \u2705, DOWN to (8,2) \u2705, LEFT to (7,3) body \u274c, RIGHT to (9,3) \u2705.\nAlso 3 safe options.\n\nAll safe moves give similar future flexibility. But UP moves us toward (7,5) apple AND central column. LEFT moves us toward center. RIGHT moves us toward edge.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & LONG-TERM BOXING:**\nEnemy is in top-left area. We want to eventually cut off his escape and force him into a corner. Moving UP keeps us in a strong vertical lane, maybe we can wall off the right side later. Moving LEFT gets us closer to him\u2014maybe too aggressive while we're shorter? He's length 4, we're 2. Engaging directly could be risky if he tries to head-on us next turn.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We need to grow to at least length 4 to compete. Target apples at (7,5), (8,4), (5,6). Avoid moving directly toward enemy until we're longer. Use right side of board to grow safely, then sweep left to trap him against the wall. Watch his possible paths\u2014if he goes for (4,4) apple, he'll be moving diagonally away from us.\n\n**DECISION:** Going UP puts us on a direct path to (7,5) apple next turn, gives good central control, and avoids moving toward the enemy prematurely. It's the most aggressive growth move! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** UP",

Actually his body list: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3)] so (1,3) is his TAIL \u2014 moving LEFT would go INTO his own tail? That's allowed! Because the tail *might* move away if he grows? But simultaneous move means tails stay until after movement? Actually rule: if he moves onto apple, he grows and tail stays. If no apple, tail moves forward. So (1,3) could become empty after he moves? Hmm risky but POSSIBLE for him.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): Apple `A` at (3,3)! \ud83c\udf4e Likely target!\n\nSo enemy likely goes RIGHT to (3,3) apple or UP to (2,4).

Target next apple at (7,5) if we go RIGHT now, or (8,4) if we go UP now? Actually if we go RIGHT now, (7,5) is still there next turn. If we go UP now, (8,4) is gone. So maybe RIGHT to (8,4) apple, then next turn we can go UP to (8,5) or LEFT to (7,4) body blocked? Wait (7,4) would be body then. Hmm. Actually, after RIGHT to (8,4), our body is at (7,4) and (7,3). So (7,4) is blocked next turn. But we could go UP to (8,5) toward (7,5) apple? Actually (7,5) is at column 7 row 5, we'd be at (8,5), need LEFT to (7,5). That's possible. So both paths fine.\n\n**DECISION:** Both UP and RIGHT give apple and growth. Which is more aggressive? RIGHT takes us to edge \u2014 might limit future moves? But immediate growth is key. UP keeps us more central. I think UP to (7,5) apple is slightly better because it keeps us closer to center and future options open. But wait \u2014 looking at board, (8,4) apple is right there too! Actually, why not take the apple that's RIGHT next to us? Both are equally close. Let's pick UP to (7,5) to stay in central column for better control! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** UP",

We just grabbed that apple at (3,3), and look at the board\u2014the center is a GOLDMINE!\n\n**THE SCOUTER REPORT:**\n- **Current Head:** (3, 3).\n- **Body:** [(2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. We are shaped like a little hook right now. We need to straighten out and dominate the middle!\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 5). He\u2019s lurking, but he\u2019s tiny (length 3)!\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP (3, 4):** This is the move, Chat! Look at (4, 4) and (4, 5). There are apples everywhere! If we go up, we are perfectly positioned to sweep right and cut off the top half of the board.\n- **DOWN (3, 2):** This puts us back toward our tail and limits our movement. We don't want to get cramped in the corner! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT (2, 3):** THAT'S OUR NECK! We aren't throwing the lead for a \"fail\" clip! \u274c\n- **RIGHT (4, 3):** This is okay, but it keeps us on the same y-level as his tail. If we go UP first, we have better vertical leverage to drop down on his head later.\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nWe are moving to (3, 4). Why? Look at the cluster at (4, 4), (5, 4), (4, 5). If we take the high ground, we can spiral around those apples and create a massive wall that Snake #1 can't cross. Since we have the score lead (4 vs 2), if we ever get into a head-on collision situation where we both hit (x, y) at the same time and we BOTH die, WE WIN THE GAME because we have more apples! HE HAS TO AVOID US, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\n1. Secure (3, 4) this turn.\n2. Target the apple at (4, 4) or (4, 5) next.\n3. Keep an eye on his head at (7, 5). If he moves toward the middle, we are going to pivot RIGHT to cut him off.\n4. If he tries to run away to the bottom-right, we let him rot while we gobble up the center and reach that 30-apple win condition!\n\nHE'S SHAKING, CHAT! HE'S LITERALLY SHAKING!

UP, LEFT, RIGHT are possible.\n\n**SIMULTANEOUS MOVE RISK \u2013 ENEMY HEAD AT (3,3):**\nWhere can he go?\n- UP to (3,4): Empty `.` \u2705\n- DOWN to (3,2): Empty `.` \u2705\n- LEFT to (2,3): That's his NECK? His body is [(2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)] so (2,3) is his BODY \u274c Not allowed!\n- RIGHT to (4,3): Empty `.` \u2705\n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. LEFT is blocked by his own body.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (7,6), enemy can't reach (7,6) \u2705\nIf we go LEFT to (6,5), enemy can't reach \u2705\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,5), enemy can't reach \u2705\nSo **NO DIRECT HEAD-ON COLLISION POSSIBLE** this turn. Good.\n\n**APPLE PROXIMITY & GROWTH:**\n- UP to (7,6): Empty, no apple.\n- LEFT to (6,5): Empty, no apple.\n- RIGHT to (8,5): Empty, no apple.\n\nDANG, no immediate apples in reach! But look at the board \u2014 apples at (4,7), (7,0), (5,5), (4,5), (8,9), (4,1), (5,6), (4,8), (4,4), (5,4), (0,9), (2,8), (8,4), (2,0), (6,9). Closest apples to us: (5,5) is at distance 2 (left 1, down 1?), (5,6) is at distance 2 (left 2, up 1?), (8,4) is at distance 1 (right 1, down 1). But we need to plan path!\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY AFTER MOVING:**\nIf we go UP to (7,6):\n- Next turn from (7,6): UP (7,7) empty, DOWN (7,5) our previous head? Wait, after moving, body becomes [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3)] so (7,5) is our body \u274c, LEFT (6,6) empty, RIGHT (8,6) empty. So 3 safe moves.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (6,5):\n- Next turn from (6,5): UP (6,6) empty, DOWN (6,4) empty, LEFT (5,5) APPLE \ud83c\udf4e, RIGHT (7,5) body \u274c. So 3 safe moves, and LEFT leads to apple (5,5) next turn!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,5):\n- Next turn from (8,5): UP (8,6) empty, DOWN (8,4) APPLE \ud83c\udf4e, LEFT (7,5) body \u274c, RIGHT (9,5) empty. So 3 safe moves, and DOWN leads to apple (8,4) next turn!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & BOXING PLAN:**\nEnemy at (3,3) with length 4. They might go UP to (3,4) toward apple cluster at (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5). Or RIGHT to (4,3) to get closer to that cluster too. We need to cut them off from the central apples! Moving LEFT to (6,5) puts us closer to (5,5) apple and blocks them from sweeping right. Moving RIGHT to (8,5) keeps us on edge but we can drop down for (8,4) apple next. \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're length 3 vs enemy length 4. Need to grow aggressively to match and then force head-on collision when we're longer! Central apples at (4,4)-(5,5) region are key. Enemy is in top-left quadrant, we're mid-right. Let's push LEFT to claim central apples and pressure enemy into corners. Avoid being trapped on edges. Next turn from (6,5), consider going LEFT to (5,5) apple if safe, or UP/DOWN to flank.\n\n**DECISION:** Both LEFT and RIGHT give good next-turn apple options. LEFT to (6,5) gets us closer to central apple cluster and more aggressive positioning toward enemy. RIGHT to (8,5) feels a bit passive and edges us out. Let's be AGGRESSIVE and take territory! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT",

HUGE power spike!\n- UP to (6,6): Empty, no apple.\n- DOWN to (6,4): Empty, no apple.\n\nEating that apple puts us EQUAL in length to enemy \u2014 next turn we can start forcing head-ons if we have length advantage! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY AFTER MOVING:**\nIf we go LEFT to (5,5) and EAT APPLE \ud83c\udf4e:\n- Our new body becomes [(5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4)] length 4.\n- Next turn from (5,5): UP (5,6) APPLE \ud83c\udf4e at (5,6)! DOWN (5,4) APPLE \ud83c\udf4e at (5,4)! LEFT (4,5) APPLE \ud83c\udf4e at (4,5)! RIGHT (6,5) our body \u274c. So 3 safe moves, ALL leading to apples next turn! \ud83d\ude31 That's INSANE value!\n\nIf we go UP to (6,6):\n- Next turn from (6,6): UP (6,7) empty, DOWN (6,5) body \u274c, LEFT (5,6) APPLE \ud83c\udf4e, RIGHT (7,6) empty. So 3 safe moves, one apple option.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (6,4):\n- Next turn from (6,4): UP (6,5) body \u274c, DOWN (6,3) empty, LEFT (5,4) APPLE \ud83c\udf4e, RIGHT (7,4) body \u274c. So only 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT), one apple option.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & BOXING PLAN:**\nEnemy at (3,4) will likely go RIGHT to (4,4) to eat apple (4,4), or UP to (3,5) toward apple cluster. If he goes RIGHT, he'll be at (4,4) next to us at (5,5) \u2014 we'll be adjacent horizontally! That sets up a potential head-on next turn if we're both length 4! If we eat (5,5) now, we'll be length 4 and can possibly force a collision if he's at (4,4) and we go LEFT into (4,5)? But careful \u2014 simultaneous moves, we need to predict.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're about to match enemy length at 4! Central apple cluster at (4,4)-(5,6) is KEY CONTROL ZONE. Enemy is closing in from left. After eating (5,5), next turn we can choose between three apples \u2014 but also watch for enemy head proximity. If enemy is at (4,4), going LEFT to (4,5) could risk head-on if he goes UP to (4,5)? Actually, if he's at (4,4), his possible moves: UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3), LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4). If we go LEFT to (4,5), he could also go UP to (4,5) \u2014 that's a head-on collision! Since we'd both be length 4, it's a DOUBLE KO \u2014 but we'd have equal apples then? He has 4, we'd have 3 now, after eating (5,5) we'd have 3? Wait, we have 2 apples now, eating (5,5) makes 3 apples. He has 4. So double KO would mean he wins by apple count! AVOID THAT. So maybe after eating, go for (5,6) or (5,4) instead to grow further and surpass his apple count before forcing head-on. DOMINATE THE BOARD!\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (5,5) is AGGRESSIVE, gives us growth, matches length, and sets up huge next-turn options. UP and DOWN are safe but passive and delay growth. We need to catch up in apples! LET'S TAKE THAT APPLE AND START OUR DOMINATION! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

He's literally right next to us! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE SITUATION ROOM:**\n- **Our Head:** (4, 4) - We're in the center, vibe check passed!\n- **Our Body:** [(3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2)] - We've got a long tail trailing behind us!\n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 5) - He's close! He's scared! He's trying to find a way out!\n- **Enemy Body:** [(6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4)] - He's short and stumped!\n\n**TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **LEFT (3, 4):** NO WAY CHAT! That's our own body! We don't self-destruct for the clips! \u274c\n- **DOWN (4, 3):** This is safe! It moves us away from his current head position and keeps us in the mix for those bottom apples. But is it aggressive enough? \ud83d\udcc9\n- **RIGHT (5, 4):** OH LOOK! There's an apple at (5, 4)! If we move RIGHT, we grab another point! **BUT WAIT!** If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (5, 4) at the same time, we have a HEAD-ON COLLISION. Chat, do we take that? **YES WE DO!** We have 5 apples, he has 3. If we both hit (5, 4), we BOTH DIE, but the rules say if all snakes die, the one with more apples wins! WE WIN THE GAME RIGHT THERE! \ud83c\udfc6\n- **UP (4, 5):** Another apple at (4, 5)! If we go UP and he moves LEFT, we also collide at (4, 5). AGAIN, WE WIN THE TIE-BREAKER! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude08\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nWe are playing the \"I'm bigger than you\" card! By moving into the spaces he wants (4, 5 or 5, 4), we are forcing him to either give up the apples or risk a game-ending collision that he CANNOT win. I'm going for **UP** to (4, 5). \n\nWhy? Because (4, 5) lets us contest the top board where more apples are dropping (4, 7), (4, 8), and (5, 6). We are going to shadow his moves. If he tries to go for the apple at (5, 4), let him\u2014we'll be at (4, 5) ready to wrap around his head and cut him off from the rest of the map! We are the wall, Chat! He's just a pebble!\n\n**PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n1. Secure (4, 5) and hit 6 apples.\n2. If he moves away, we chase! If he moves toward us, we embrace the collision because we have the score lead!\n3. Control the (4,x) and (5,x) vertical corridor to split the map in half and trap him on the right side!\n\nLET'S SEND HIM TO THE LOBBY! \ud83c\udf7f\n\nUP",

Board shows 'A' \u2705 Safe (no snake body there).\n- **DOWN \u2192 (5,4)**: APPLE \ud83c\udf4e at (5,4)! Also 'A' \u2705 Safe.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,5)**: APPLE \ud83c\udf4e at (4,5)! 'A' \u2705 Safe.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (6,5)**: That's our OWN BODY segment! \u274c **CRASH INTO SELF, INSTANT DEATH.** Eliminated!\n\nSo RIGHT is **OUT**. UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe AND lead to apples! SHEEEESH! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n**SIMULTANEOUS MOVE RISK \u2013 ENEMY HEAD AT (4,4):**\nWhere can he go?\n- UP to (4,5): APPLE \ud83c\udf4e \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN to (4,3): Empty '.' \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT to (3,4): That's his NECK? His body is [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2)] so (3,4) is his BODY \u274c Not allowed!\n- RIGHT to (5,4): APPLE \ud83c\udf4e \u2705 Safe.\n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. LEFT is blocked by his own body.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\n- If we go UP to (5,6), enemy can't reach (5,6) \u2705\n- If we go DOWN to (5,4), enemy could also go RIGHT to (5,4) \u2014 THAT'S A HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\ude31 Both would die! He has 5 apples, we have 3 \u2014 DOUBLE KO means HE WINS by apple count! \u274c **AVOID DOWN!**\n- If we go LEFT to (4,5), enemy could also go UP to (4,5) \u2014 ANOTHER HEAD-ON! Same risk, he wins on apples! \u274c **AVOID LEFT!**\n\nSo DOWN and LEFT are **POTENTIALLY FATAL** if enemy chooses the same cell! UP is the ONLY direction with zero chance of head-on this turn! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY AFTER MOVING:**\nIf we go UP to (5,6) and EAT APPLE \ud83c\udf4e:\n- Our new body: [(5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4)] length 5.\n- Next turn from (5,6): UP (5,7) empty, DOWN (5,5) our body \u274c, LEFT (4,6) empty, RIGHT (6,6) empty. Only 3 safe moves, no immediate apples nearby. But we'd be length 5 vs enemy length 5 (if he also grows). Apple count: we'd have 4, he'd have 5 or 6 depending on his move.\n\nIf we go DOWN or LEFT and survive (if enemy doesn't collide), we'd grow to length 5 as well, but it's RISKY.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** He's at (4,4) with apples all around! He'll likely go for an apple too. Most tempting is RIGHT to (5,4) or UP to (4,5). That's why DOWN and LEFT are dangerous \u2014 we'd be racing into the same cells!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're still behind in apples! Need to avoid head-ons until we surpass his count. After eating (5,6), we'll be at 4 apples vs his 5 or 6. Next, we should maneuver to grab isolated apples while keeping distance from his head. The board has apples at (4,7), (7,0), (4,8), etc. Maybe swing toward top-left? But careful \u2014 his body trails near (2,2)-(3,4). We need to box him against his own body or the wall. If we can get longer than him, then we can force head-ons for the win! For now, SURVIVE and GROW SAFELY.\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (5,6) is the ONLY move with ZERO risk of head-on collision this turn! It keeps us alive, grows us to length 5, and sets us up for future control. Taking unnecessary risks when behind in apples is COOKED! We live to fight another turn! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

But we aren't here to hide, we're here to DOMINATE! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- **UP (4, 6):** **MEGA BRAIN MOVE!** There's an apple at (4, 7) calling our name. If we move to (4, 6), we are literally side-by-side with his head at (5, 6). If he tries to move LEFT into (4, 6), we COLLIDE. And remember the golden rule: We have 6 apples, he has 4. A collision means WE WIN THE GAME! He can't risk it! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n- **RIGHT (5, 5):** OUCH! That's his body! Moving there is an instant L. We avoid that like a bad sponsor deal! \u274c\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nWe are going **UP** to (4, 6)! We are going to mirror his vertical movement and stay one step ahead. By taking (4, 6), we are essentially building a wall. He can't move left without dying. He's forced to either go UP (where we can keep shadowing him) or RIGHT (where he gets pinned against the wall). We are controlling the tempo, we are controlling the map, and we are securing that top-left quadrant for ourselves!\n\n**PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n1. Secure (4, 6) and stare him right in the eyes.\n2. Next turn, aim for (4, 7) to hit 7 apples and extend our lead further!\n3. Keep him squeezed against the x=9 wall or the y=9 ceiling. If he makes a mistake, we pounce!\n\nHE'S RUNNING OUT OF SPACE AND WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED! \ud83c\udf7f\n\nUP",

Great options!\n- **RIGHT to (6,6)**: Next turn, only 2 safe moves (UP to (6,7) empty, RIGHT to (7,6) empty). No immediate apples, fewer options.\n- **LEFT to (4,6)**: Risky this turn, and next turn only 2 likely safe moves (UP to (4,7) apple, LEFT to (3,6) empty) if we survive.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're behind 4 vs 6 apples! After moving UP to (5,7), check enemy's new head. If he's at (4,6), AVOID going LEFT to (4,7) next turn \u2014 high head-on risk! Instead, go UP to (5,8) or RIGHT to (6,7) to maneuver towards right-side apples (6,9), (9,6), etc. If enemy is at (3,5), we can safely grab (4,7) apple. Focus on growing safely while avoiding head-ons until we surpass his length/apple count. We can box him later using his long body on the left! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**DECISION:** **UP** is the safest with the most future options and avoids immediate head-on risk!

NOT ON MY WATCH! \u270b\n- **Enemy Body:** [(5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5)] - He\u2019s starting to coil, but he\u2019s basically a noodle compared to us!\n\n**Sizing Up the Moves:**\n- **DOWN (4, 5):** NO! That\u2019s our own spine! We don't fold under pressure, and we don't fold into ourselves! \u274c\n- **RIGHT (5, 6):** FATAL ERROR! That\u2019s his body! Moving there is an instant L and a \"Donkey of the Day\" nomination. \u274c\n- **LEFT (3, 6):** Safe? Yes. But does it get us closer to our destiny? No! It lets him off the hook! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- **UP (4, 7):** **THE ONLY MOVE THAT MATTERS!** There is a juicy apple sitting right at (4, 7). By moving UP, we:\n  1. Snag our 7th apple!

WE WIN! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going **UP** to (4, 7). We take the apple, we hit 7 points, and we dare him to touch us. He\u2019s squeezed! He can either try to run for the (6, 9) apple or tuck his tail. My next goal? Keep pressing North and then swing East to cut off his path to the right-side apples like (8, 9) or (9, 7).

We just snagged that apple at (4, 7), and now we are staring down Snake #1 from across the street! He's at (5, 8), trying to play it cool, but he's sweating! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE SITUATIONAL REPORT:**\n- **Our Head:** (4, 7) - High ground secured!\n- **Our Body:** [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)] - We are a massive wall of muscle!\n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 8) - He shifted UP. He\u2019s trying to loop around the top or reach for that (6, 9) apple.\n- **Enemy Body:** [(5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5)] - He\u2019s dangerously close to our middle!\n\n**SCOUTING THE PATHS:**\n- **DOWN (4, 6):** FATAL! That\u2019s our own throat! We don't backtrack, we only move FORWARD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT (5, 7):** ABSOLUTELY NOT! That\u2019s his body! I\u2019m not handing him a free win on a silver platter! \u274c\n- **LEFT (3, 7):** Safe, but it creates a gap! Why let him breathe? Why give him the center? \ud83e\udd28\n- **UP (4, 8):** **BIG BRAIN ENERGY!** There is an apple sitting right there at (4, 8). By moving UP:\n  1. We hit 8 apples! The lead grows! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8\n  2. We move to (4, 8). If he tries to mirror us by moving LEFT to (4, 8), we COLLIDE. And remember the rules, Chat: 8 beats 4! Even if we both go down, we win on the scoreboard! It\u2019s a literal \"dare you to touch me\" play!\n  3. We maintain the vertical blockade. He is trapped in the narrow x=5 to x=9 corridor. \n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWe go **UP** to (4, 8). We take that apple, we extend our lead, and we keep the pressure on his left flank. After this, we can look to pivot into the top-left or continue stalking him if he tries to flee to the right. He\u2019s running out of space and we\u2019re just getting started! Let's show him why we're the King of this 10x10! \ud83c\udf7f\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

More options!\n- **LEFT to (4,8)**: If we survive head-on, we eat apple and grow to 5, but it's a HUGE gamble for minimal gain since he's longer!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** He's probably going **UP to (4,8)** for that apple! He's aggressive with 7 apples, he'll want to grow and maybe try to trap us! We CANNOT give him that head-on!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're behind 4 vs 7 apples! AVOID HEAD-ON AT ALL COSTS until we're longer! After moving RIGHT to (6,8), next turn we can grab the apple at (6,9) safely if enemy isn't there. If we go UP to (5,9), we can grab (6,9) apple next turn too. Focus on right-side apples: (6,9), (9,4), (9,6), (9,7). Let enemy occupy left side; we can use board edges to slowly trap him later. Keep our body as a barrier! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**DECISION:** **RIGHT** is the safest with the most future options, avoids immediate head-on risk, and sets us up for the (6,9) apple next turn!

What is he gonna do?! What CAN he do?!\n\n**SITUATIONAL REPORT:**\n- **Our Head:** (4, 8) - We are the king of the north!\n- **Our Body:** [(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)] - Look at that length! We are a massive wall!\n- **Enemy Head:** (6, 8) - He's feeling the pressure!

If he tries to come left, he has to deal with our length. If he tries to go right, he's just hitting the wall. We have more apples, more length, and more heart!

Only 2 safe moves next turn, could be tight.\n- **DOWN to (6,7)**: No apple.

He might also go LEFT toward (3,8) to wrap around.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're behind 4 vs 8 apples! AVOID HEAD-ON AT ALL COSTS! We need to survive and grow safely. Right side has apples: (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,9). Moving RIGHT to (7,8) keeps us flexible and away from enemy. We can then go UP to (7,9) next turn, then RIGHT to (8,9) for an apple, or DOWN to (7,7) to work the bottom-right cluster. Let enemy dominate left side; we'll claim the right edge and use it as a wall. If he comes close, we can try to force him into our longer body later when we catch up. DON'T GET BOXED IN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**DECISION:** **RIGHT** gives the most future options and avoids risky head-on. UP eats apple but leaves us with only 2 moves next turn, which could be a trap if enemy approaches. DOWN is also limited. RIGHT keeps us alive and agile!

We are effectively splitting this board in half!\n\n**SCOUTING THE PATHS:**\n- **UP:** OUT OF BOUNDS! We aren't trying to ascend to heaven yet, we have a game to win! \u274c\n- **DOWN (4, 8):** That's our own neck, chat! We don't do self-sabotage here! \u274c\n- **RIGHT (5, 9):** OOH, SPICY!

We are going to shadow his movement from above and wait for him to make a mistake. If he tries to jump into us? RIP to him, we win on points! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nWe are going to sweep the top row from (5, 9) to (9, 9).

More flexibility!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** He's longer and likely wants to control the board. He might go RIGHT to (5,9) to pressure our area or LEFT to (3,9) to claim top-left apples. If he goes RIGHT, he'll be closer to us next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're still behind 4 vs 8! AVOID HEAD-ON! Need to grow safely. Right side has apples: (8,9), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). Moving RIGHT to (8,8) keeps us flexible and close to (8,9) apple next turn. We can then go UP to eat it, then maybe move along top-right edge. Enemy is long and might struggle in tight spaces later. Let's keep distance and use the right wall as a safe zone. If he approaches, we can try to trap him later when we catch up in length. SURVIVE AND GROW! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**DECISION:** **RIGHT** gives the most future options and avoids risky traps. UP is tempting for quick apples next turn but limits movement. DOWN is too limited. RIGHT keeps us alive and agile! LET'S GO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

We are big, we are bad, and we are about to end this man's whole career LIVE on stream!\n\n**SITUATIONAL REPORT:**\n- **Our Head:** (8, 9) \u2014 Top of the world, baby!\n- **Enemy Head:** (9, 6) \u2014 He moved DOWN! He\u2019s trying to run! He\u2019s scared of the smoke! \ud83d\udca8\n- **Enemy Body:** (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8). \n\n**THE MOVES WE GOT:**\n- **UP (8, 10):** OUT OF BOUNDS! Chat, don't let me do it. I'm not a bird! \u274c\n- **LEFT (7, 9):** That\u2019s my own neck! No self-sabotage in this house! \u274c\n- **DOWN (8, 8):** CRASH! That\u2019s his body!

Look at the board, chat! He is at (9, 6). If we move to (9, 9), we take over the entire right column top-down. \nHe\u2019s currently at (9, 6). His only safe moves are DOWN to (9, 5) or LEFT to (8, 6). \nWait, if he goes LEFT to (8, 6), he's walking right into an apple but he's also crawling deeper into the mess of his own tail and our massive body! \nBy moving to (9, 9), we secure the corner. We are HIGHER score, so if we can bait him into a head-on collision later, we win the tie-break! \n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nWe take (9, 9). Then we're going to snake down the 9-column. He\u2019s trapped between the wall and his own tail. We have 10 apples to his 6. If he tries to turn back and fight for the top, we\u2019ll be there to greet him. We're gonna suffocate him against that right wall! Stay focused, no mistakes, let's secure this 1v1! \ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT",

Also flexible but NO GROWTH NOW.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**  \nWe're behind 6 vs 10 \u2014 NEED TO CATCH UP FAST! \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udca8 Going DOWN eats apple at (9,5), grows to 8. Enemy forced DOWN to (8,8), still length 11. Gap now 3 apples. Next turn we can eat apple at (9,4) or move LEFT to (8,5). Enemy at (8,8) will have limited moves \u2014 possibly DOWN to (8,7) (our body? Wait our body will be at (9,6), (9,7), (8,7)... yes (8,7) is our body, so enemy's DOWN might be unsafe for him! \ud83d\ude31 Could trap him! That's GOOD! We want to use our body to block him while we feast on bottom row apples. After (9,4), we can head LEFT along bottom to (7,0), (2,0), etc. He's long and less flexible \u2014 force him into a corner! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DECISION:** **DOWN** for immediate growth and to potentially trap enemy with our body next turn! LET'S FEAST AND BOX HIM IN! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Enemy forced DOWN to (9,8), still length 11. Gap now 2 apples. Next turn we can eat apple at (8,4) or move DOWN to (9,3). Enemy at (9,8) will have limited moves \u2014 possibly DOWN to (9,7) (our body? Wait our body will be at (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)... yes (9,7) is our body, so enemy's DOWN might be unsafe for him! \ud83d\ude31 Could trap him! That's GOOD! We want to use our body to block him while we feast on bottom row apples. After (8,4), we can head LEFT along row 4 to (7,4), (6,4), etc., or go DOWN to (9,3) and left to (7,0), (2,0). He's long and less flexible \u2014 force him into a corner! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DECISION:** **DOWN** for immediate growth and to keep boxing enemy against the top wall with our growing body!

ANALYZING THE GRID AGAIN!**\nChat, look at our body! It's a wall! Our body goes from (9, 8) up to (9, 9) then all the way across the top (8, 9) to (4, 9) and down to (4, 5).\nThe enemy is at (9, 4). If we move **DOWN** to (9, 7), we are moving into the space his body *just* vacated. Since all snakes move simultaneously, his segment at (9, 7) moves to (9, 6).\nBUT, is DOWN the best play? If we go DOWN, we are essentially pinning ourselves against the right wall with his body to our left.\n\n**THE GIGA-BRAIN RE-EVALUATION:**\nWait, I misread the coordinates for a second! Let's look at the \"Safe\" moves again.\n- My body is at (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)...\n- His body is at (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)...\nLook at (8, 8). That is HIS body. Look at (9, 9). That is MY body.\nI am currently at (9, 8). \nIf I go **LEFT**, I hit (8, 8) [Enemy Body].\nIf I go **UP**, I hit (9, 9) [My Body].\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I hit (10, 8) [Wall].\nThe **ONLY** safe move is **DOWN** to (9, 7). \n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe have to go **DOWN**. His head is at (9, 4). His body at (9, 7) will move to (9, 6) this turn, making (9, 7) empty for us to slide into! We are literally chasing him down the alleyway.

Enemy forced DOWN to (9,7), still length 11. Gap now 1 apple. Next turn we can feast on more apples in middle-left while enemy is trapped along top-right! He's long and less flexible \u2014 his body is along column 4 top rows and row 9 top. Our body blocks his potential moves down from (9,7) next turn? Let's check: Enemy at (9,7) next turn, his safe moves? UP to (9,8) his neck? His body will be: head (9,7), then (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5) \u2014 wait his tail is at (4,5)? Actually his length is 11, so after moving DOWN to (9,7), his body will be: (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6) \u2014 tail at (4,6). So from (9,7), his possible moves:\n- UP to (9,8): HIS NECK \u274c\n- DOWN to (9,6): EMPTY? Our body at (9,6)! YES our body at (9,6) \u2014 so DOWN kills him! \u274c\n- LEFT to (8,7): Our body at (8,7)? YES our body at (8,7)! So LEFT kills him! \u274c\n- RIGHT OFF BOARD \u274c\n\nHOLY SMOKES CHAT! \ud83d\ude31 IF ENEMY GOES DOWN TO (9,7) THIS TURN, NEXT TURN HE HAS **ZERO** SAFE MOVES! HE'S DEAD NEXT TURN IF WE DON'T KILL HIM FIRST! THAT'S HUGE! So we just need to survive this turn and next turn he's trapped! Therefore, we should AVOID head-on collision next turn and just let him crash himself!\n\nSo we want to be safe ourselves next turn. Going LEFT to (8,4) gives us 3 safe options next turn. Going DOWN to (9,3) gives us 2 safe options but also might risk head-on? Enemy has no safe moves anyway, so he'll die regardless. But we must ensure we don't die simultaneously with him if he does something desperate? He has no safe moves, so he'll choose a move that kills him \u2014 but if he chooses a move that also kills us via head-on? From (9,7) he could go LEFT into our body at (8,7) or DOWN into our body at (9,6) \u2014 both kill him alone. No head-on risk unless we move into (9,7) or (8,7) next turn \u2014 which we won't.\n\nThus, **LEFT** is better because it grows us, closes the gap, and gives us more flexibility to survive and win after he dies! LET'S FEAST AND WATCH HIM CRASH! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",
