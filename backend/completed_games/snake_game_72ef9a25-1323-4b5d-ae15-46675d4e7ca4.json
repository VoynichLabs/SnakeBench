From there, I can start moving right along y=7 to reach that apple with ample space.\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,6) is safe but less directly aligned with the immediate apple on y=7; it slightly constrains the next immediate safe paths toward that apple.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Head toward the apple at (6,7) by staying on or moving to y=7 and traversing right: (0,7) -> (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (3,7) -> (4,7) -> (5,7) -> (6,7).\n- After securing that apple, reassess and pursue (9,9) or (9,5) while continuing to avoid left-edge traps and keeping distance from the enemy head at (0,3).\n- Always favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-ups and avoid tight squeezes; maintain space to dodge any sudden enemy moves.\n\nUP",

Possible moves: UP to (2,8); DOWN to (2,6); LEFT to (1,7); RIGHT to (3,7).\n- All four moves stay on the board and do not collide with your own body (length 1).\n- Enemy snake is at (2,2) with a body at (1,2); it is far away and unlikely to threaten a near-term path to the right.\n- Apples are at (2,1), (6,7), (9,5), (6,1), (9,9). The closest and most accessible apple from the current position is (6,7) on the right, so heading toward the right keeps options open and aligns with the nearest target.\n- Going UP risks getting closer to the top edge, which could limit future options; DOWN heads toward the apple at (2,1) but requires more turns and detours to reach the right-side apple cluster; LEFT reduces access to the right-side apples and could invite trap-like spacing.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move toward the right-side apple cluster (x around 6\u20139, y around 7) while staying in open space to avoid traps.\n- After reaching (6,7), continue toward (9,7) then target the other far apples (e.g., (9,5) and (9,9)).\n- Monitor the enemy\u2019s movements; avoid paths that could cause head-on collisions or force a corner trap. If the enemy starts converging toward the right, consider slightly adjusting height to keep multiple escape routes.\n\nDecision:\nRIGHT",

From (7,4), LEFT and DOWN both reduce distance to those apples (both give manhattan ~3 after the move). RIGHT increases distance and also limits escape options next turn because of the right wall.\n- DOWN (to 7,3) preserves three follow-up options (left, right, down) and keeps me centered, maintaining flexibility to go after (6,1) or swing toward (4,3) if the board opens.\n- LEFT (to 6,4) is also reasonable (three follow-ups: up, left, down), but it nudges me toward the enemy-dense left corridor in the long run.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move DOWN now to stay flexible and head into the lower half.\n- Next turns, prioritize the (6,1) apple (nearest and less contested), while avoiding getting funneled left into the opponent's crowded area.

Enemy's neck is at (5,3) so it cannot move LEFT; its plausible moves are UP to (6,4) or DOWN to (6,2). Moving UP into (6,3) is allowed (it would move into the enemy's current head cell), but there's no guarantee the enemy won't choose a move that makes my follow-ups worse.\n- LEFT -> (5,2) is empty and safe, but moves me away from the nearby apple and into a corridor with the enemy body right above (5,3).\n- DOWN -> (6,1) contains an apple and is empty \u2014 legal and gives an immediate apple.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- The enemy head can move DOWN to (6,2) or UP to (6,4). Neither of those causes an immediate collision if I go DOWN to (6,1); at worst the enemy advances toward me and I must be cautious next turn.\n- Taking the apple now gains a guaranteed point and increases my options next turn; avoiding the apple lets the enemy potentially approach or contest it.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Eat the apple now (6,1). After eating, prioritize moves that keep at least two escape options (avoid getting funneled into the dense left cluster). If the enemy closes in from above, prefer sidestepping to open space and then head toward the nearest untaken apple cluster on the left side while keeping distance.\n\nFinal move:\nDOWN",

It also avoids moving to the board edge where options drop off.\n- Enemy head at (2,6) cannot contest (1,1) this turn; snake #0 is most likely to go toward (2,7). The crowded central corridor (x>=3) is still congested, so staying in column 1 and taking the (1,2) apple is a safe, efficient plan.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move UP now to (1,1), then UP again to (1,2) to eat the apple.

So RIGHT is unsafe.\n- DOWN to (3,1) looks initially ok but quickly forces me into (2,1) and then leaves me with no escape (neighbors are occupied). So DOWN also leads to an imminent trap.\n- UP to (3,3) is the best option: it keeps access to multiple free cells (I can go from (3,3) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (2,4) or (1,3) etc.), avoids immediate collision risk, and steers me away from the tight corridor on the right.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move UP into open space, then continue toward the left/up region (approach apple at (1,5) if it remains contestable) while avoiding the blocked right side near x\u22654\u20137.

The best immediate play is to take the short path to (5,2) to close the score gap. Moving DOWN keeps multiple safe continuations (including grabbing the apple next turn) while avoiding the enemy cluster near column 0 and the occupied cells at y=6.\n\nShort plan: go DOWN to (5,3), then DOWN to (5,2) to eat that apple. After that, reassess \u2014 prefer routes that avoid the dense enemy blocks around column 0 and column 6 at y\u22486, and favor open spaces to remain flexible for the remaining apples.\n\nDOWN",
