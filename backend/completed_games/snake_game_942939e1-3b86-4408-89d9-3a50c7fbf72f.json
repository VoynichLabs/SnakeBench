Opens up movement toward (9,3) and (9,4). \n- **LEFT** to (8,1): Empty. Safe. Moves toward the center.\n- **DOWN** to (9,0): Empty. Safe. Bottom edge.\n- **RIGHT** to (10,1): OFF BOARD. DEAD. Instant loss. Not happening.\n\nEliminating RIGHT immediately. Now, where does the enemy move? He's at (4,7). He might chase apples (maybe (5,5) or (3,8) or (3,9)). But we need to pressure him. Moving UP puts us at (9,2). If he moves DOWN or LEFT, we're still safe. If he moves UP or RIGHT, we're fine. Moving LEFT to (8,1) is also safe but doesn't gain height. Moving DOWN to (9,0) is safe but traps us on the bottom edge, limiting future options. \n\nWe want to dominate the right side of the board. **UP** keeps us mobile and closer to potential apples at (9,9) or (8,9) later. It also keeps us away from his immediate path. If we can get high up, we can cut him off.\n\nLong-term plan: Push up the right wall, force him into the center, then close the trap. He's only 1 apple, we're tied. We need to be aggressive but not stupid.\n\nDecision: **UP**\n\nUP",

Enemy at (4,8). We just moved UP from (9,1) to (9,2).\n\n**Threat Analysis:**\n- Enemy is at (4,8) - he's closer to the top-left apples. If he goes RIGHT or UP, he might chase (5,5) or (3,9).\n- I'm on the right edge at (9,2). I need to control the right side and prepare to cut him off.\n\n**My Options:**\n- **UP** to (9,3): Safe, empty. Gets me higher, closer to potential apples at (9,9) or (8,9). Opens up (9,4) next.\n- **LEFT** to (8,2): Safe, empty. Moves toward center, but might bring me closer to enemy's potential path.\n- **DOWN** to (9,1): Safe, but I just came from there. Moving DOWN is moving backward - not helpful for positioning.\n- **RIGHT** to (10,2): OFF BOARD. DEAD. No go.\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\nIf I go UP, I'm claiming the right column. If I go LEFT, I'm entering the battlefield. Since we're trying to BOX HIM IN, I need to establish territory first. UP keeps me safe on the edge while maintaining mobility. LEFT might be aggressive, but I could get trapped if enemy moves toward me.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Claim the right edge, work my way up to (9,9), then swing LEFT to cut off his escape routes. Force him into the center-left where he'll have fewer options. Apples are secondary - board control is primary.\n\nDecision: **UP** (stay on the edge, keep options open, dominate the right side)\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

No immediate self-collisions or wall dangers.\n- Opponent is far at (9,2); no current head-on risk in the next step.\n\nMOVE OPTION ANALYSIS\n- UP to (4,9): will eat the apple at (4,9) and push us into the top row with a clean open space after. High growth, and we gain early positional advantage.\n- DOWN to (4,7): safe, but no immediate apple and keeps us more central.\n- LEFT to (3,8): will eat the apple at (3,8) as well; shifts us toward the left-center cluster\u2014still safe but closer to possible traps.\n- RIGHT to (5,8): safe, continues toward the right-center, near other apples but less immediate growth than UP.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE\n- The immediate Apple at (4,9) is a clean, high-reward hit that also preserves open escape routes in the next few moves.\n- Moving UP keeps us away from the opponent\u2019s current lane and avoids funneling into a potential trap while giving multiple safe follow-ups.\n- I\u2019m prioritizing growth and board control without sacrificing safety or forcing awkward backtrack.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Move UP to (4,9), eat the apple, grow to length 2 (effectively still one head and a tail after the move) and establish a stronger presence near the top-center.\n- From there, assess whether to push toward other central apples or cut toward the left to threaten future box-closing patterns against the opponent.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE\n- If we pull ahead on apples, lean into aggressive positioning to encourage head-on opportunities or to force the opponent into constrained lanes, while always keeping a safe escape path open.\n\nMOVE\nup",

If I go LEFT into the center (8,3), I'm entering his territory and risking a collision. If I go UP to (9,4), I'm keeping the right edge mine while staying flexible.\n\nWait - enemy is at (4,9). If he moves RIGHT to (5,9) and I move LEFT to (8,3), we're not close. If he moves DOWN to (4,8) and I move LEFT to (8,3), still far.\n\nActually, let's think about future positioning. If I stay on the edge (UP to (9,4)), I can control the entire right side. If I go LEFT, I'm committing to the center battle where the enemy is.\n\nGiven the enemy is at y=9 and I'm at y=3, he's above me. By moving UP to (9,4), I'm moving toward him (same y-direction) while staying on the safe edge. This gives me the option to later swing LEFT and cut him off.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Claim the entire right column (9,0) to (9,9). Force enemy into left side where he'll be trapped. Once I'm high enough, swing LEFT across row y=9 and block his escape. Let him eat apples in the corner - I'll cut him off and force the collision.\n\nDecision: **UP** - Keep the edge, stay safe, climb toward the high apples, keep options open for LEFT pivot later.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Let's break down the situation.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n- My head: (9,4) - I'm still on that right edge, holding it down\n- Enemy head: (3,9) - He's moved DOWN from (4,9), now he's at (3,9)\n- Score: I have 0 apples, he has 1 - I'm behind, gotta close that gap\n- My body: Still just my head, no tail yet\n- Enemy body: One segment at (4,9)\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at the map, I see apples everywhere but I'm staying disciplined. The enemy is at (3,9) on the top row. From there, he can move:\n- LEFT to (2,9) - safe\n- RIGHT to (4,9) - but that's HIS OWN BODY! He'd be moving backwards into himself, which kills him! \n- DOWN to (3,8) - safe\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (9,5)**: SAFE - Empty cell. Continues my climb up the edge.

If he moves RIGHT into his own body (4,9), he's dead! That's a possibility but I can't count on it. More likely he goes DOWN to (3,8) or LEFT to (2,9).\n\nIf I go UP to (9,5), I'm continuing to claim the right edge. If I go LEFT to (8,4), I'm moving toward the center where the action is. \n\nRight now, I need to think about the future. The enemy is on the top-left corner area. I'm on the bottom-right edge. If I stay on the edge and climb up, I can eventually swing LEFT across the top row and cut off his escape route. If I go LEFT now into (8,4), I'm entering the battlefield early.\n\nGiven his position at (3,9) and my position at (9,4), we're far apart. The most aggressive move is to continue claiming the right edge while climbing toward the top, then pivot left to box him in later.\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (9,5).

So UP is out.\n- Safe options this turn: DOWN to (2,7), LEFT to (1,8), or RIGHT to (3,8) (eat).\n- Objective alignment: We\u2019re ahead 1 apple (1 vs 0). We should press the advantage when safe and keep options open for future box control.\n\nDecision rationale:\n- RIGHT (3,8) is the strongest immediate gain. It eats the apple at (3,8), growing us to length 3 and boosting our score lead. It also centralizes us on a key axis (row 8) that can be leveraged to slice toward the opponent\u2019s space later without risking immediate self-collision.\n- DOWN (2,7) is solid safety, but it stalls growth and gives the opponent more room to maneuver around us later.\n- LEFT (1,8) is safe but doesn\u2019t threaten the opponent or push us toward a strategic box quickly.\n\nShort-term plan if we go RIGHT:\n- Eat at (3,8) this turn, becoming length 3 with body [(3,8),(2,8),(2,9)].\n- Next turns, push along the 8th row to collect the apple at (6,8) and prune open space for a potential box maneuver toward the opponent, while watching for any risky head-on lines.\n\nGiven aggression with safety, I\u2019m taking the apple grab and moving RIGHT.\n\nright",

Let's break down the board.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n- My head: (9, 7) - Right edge, one step closer to the top-right apple at (9, 9)\n- Enemy head: (3, 8) - He just moved RIGHT into the apple at (3, 8)! That's his 2nd apple, so he grew to length 3 now\n- Score: 0 vs 2 - I'm still down, but I see my chance\n- My body: Still just me, no tail\n- Enemy body: Now [(2, 8), (2, 9)] - He's stretched out on the top-left edge\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy at (3, 8) with body behind him at (2, 8) and (2, 9). He's vulnerable!\nMy move options from (9, 7):\n1. **UP to (9, 8)**: SAFE - Empty cell.

Not ideal for momentum.\n3. **LEFT to (8, 7)**: SAFE - Moving toward center, but gives up my right-edge advantage.\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 7)**: DEAD - Off board. RIP.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nIf I go UP to (9, 8), I'm one step away from the apple at (9, 9)! That apple is MINE - I'm already claiming the right edge. Meanwhile, the enemy is all the way on the left side. If I grab that apple, I grow to length 2 and cut the score to 1-2.\n\nBut here's the COLD part - I'm watching his positioning. He's at (3, 8) with his body blocking his left and up. If he gets greedy and tries to go RIGHT again toward the apple at (5, 5) or center, he might expose himself. But right now, he's safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** \nClaim the right edge completely. Swing LEFT across row 8-9 to box him into the top-left corner. Force him into a corner where he'll have to make a risky move. Then when I have the size advantage, I can go for the head-on collision and WIN.\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (9, 8).

Strategy here is aggressive pressure on the rival with minimal risk to us. Let\u2019s break it down and then drop the move.\n\nSAFE MOVES from our HEAD at (4,8):\n- UP to (4,9): Safe. Not off-board, not into our body, not colliding with the rival now. But it kicks us to the top edge away from immediate pressure.\n- DOWN to (4,7): Safe. Keeps us in the middle-ish lanes with flexible follow-ups toward apples without exposing us to a head-on risk right away.\n- LEFT to (3,8): DEAD. That\u2019s our own body; would be a fatal crash.\n- RIGHT to (5,8): Safe. That\u2019s the aggressive option that closes distance to the rival along row 8 and moves toward the nearby apple on (6,8) for a growth spike next turn.\n\nBEST CHOICE:\nRIGHT. It keeps the pressure on the rival, stays on the same row to potentially force a narrowly-angled chase, and sets up a future play to eat the apple at (6,8) while keeping multiple escape routes open.\n\nRationale and game sense:\n- We\u2019re ahead 2 apples to 0. Pushing for a head-on later is smart if we can shorten the distance and threaten the same cell as him, but we\u2019re not in a position to force a true head-on immediately. Right now, stepping to (5,8) both reduces distance and keeps us in line with the apple cluster on row 8, which gives us growth potential without sacrificing too much safety.\n- Moving Up or Down would loosen the leash on him and could allow him to slip away or re-orient around the board edges. Right keeps us in the sweet spot between chasing him and not overextending into dead-ends.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Press along row 8 toward (6,8) to assure a growth next turn if the apple is still free. If he moves toward (8,8) or (9,8), mirror with controlled lateral moves to prevent him from slipping into a corner.\n- If the opportunity arises and the board opens up, set up a two-step compression against the top/right boundary to force a tight squeeze, aiming for a head-on only when we\u2019ve clearly got the higher apple count and the risk is minimized.\n- Always keep an exit route: don\u2019t let our only safe option trap us into a one-way path. Maintain at least two safe follow-ups after any move.\n\nNow executing the plan: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

The board is getting contested, but I'm claiming the top-right corner aggressively!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nEnemy at (5, 8) moving... could he move UP to (5, 9)? Possibly, but he's far from me. Could he move RIGHT to (6, 8)? Maybe. The apple at (6, 8) might be tempting him. But I'm at (9, 9) and moving to (8, 9) - we're not on a collision course right now.\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (8, 9) - I'm snatching that apple and tying the score! Let's GOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

My last move was LEFT, so my head is now at (8, 9) and my body is [(9, 9), (9, 8)].\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW:**\n- **My head:** (8, 9) \u2014 I'm in the top row, second column from the right.\n- **My body:** [(9, 9), (9, 8)] \u2014 My tail is still at (9, 8), so my body is on the right edge.\n- **Enemy head:** (6, 8) \u2014 He moved LEFT from (7, 8) to (6, 8)? Wait, no, last turn he was at (6, 8) after moving RIGHT from (5, 8)? Actually, from the replay: he was at (5, 8) last turn, but the current state shows (6, 8) for his head. Hmm, he must have moved RIGHT to (6, 8) this turn? But the replay says he was at (5, 8) and moved RIGHT to (6, 8) during last turn's action. Let me check the board state: row 8 shows \"0\" at column 6, and his body parts at (5,8), (4,8), (3,8). So he's at (6,8) now. He's moving right along row 8.\n- **Enemy body:** [(5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8)] \u2014 Length 4 total (head + 3 body).\n- **Apples:** Multiple on the board, but note: there's an apple at (7, 2), (3, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4), (3, 4), (3, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 6), (5, 5), (6, 1), (5, 0), (6, 9), (9, 3), (0, 3). Crucially, there's an apple at (6, 9) \u2014 that's directly UP from my current head at (8, 9)? Wait, (6,9) is two columns left and same row? Actually, (6,9) is at column 6, row 9. From my head at (8,9), that's two steps LEFT on the same row. Also, there's an apple at (7,2) \u2014 far down. And (9,3) \u2014 that's at column 9, row 3. From (8,9), going DOWN to (8,8) then... but need to think.\n\n**EVALUATE MY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (8, 9):**\n1. **UP to (8, 10)** \u2014 OFF BOARD! Dead. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (8, 8)** \u2014 Is it safe? Let's check: My body is at (9,9) and (9,8). (8,8) is not occupied by my body. Enemy body? At (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8). (8,8) is empty. Enemy head? At (6,8), not at (8,8). So this is SAFE initially. BUT, we have to consider simultaneous movement: if enemy moves UP to (6,9), that's not affecting (8,8). Also, what about apples? (8,8) has no apple, but it might lead to future opportunities. However, staying on row 8 might put me close to the enemy on row 8? Enemy is at (6,8), so if I go to (8,8), we're separated by two columns. Could be okay.\n3. **LEFT to (7, 9)** \u2014 Check safety: My body is at (9,9) and (9,8). (7,9) is not occupied by me. Enemy body: none at (7,9). Enemy head: at (6,8), not at (7,9). So SAFE. Also, there's an apple at (7,2) \u2014 not here. But wait, is there an apple at (7,9)? From the list: apples at (7,2), not (7,9). So no apple here. However, moving LEFT puts me closer to the center and potentially towards other apples. Also, from (7,9), I could go DOWN to (7,8) or LEFT to (6,9) which has an apple! That's interesting: (6,9) has an apple! So by going LEFT to (7,9), I set up for next turn to potentially go LEFT again to (6,9) and eat that apple.\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 9)** \u2014 Is it safe? My body includes (9,9) right now? Wait, my body is [(9,9), (9,8)]. (9,9) is my first body segment (right after head at 8,9). So moving RIGHT into (9,9) would be moving into my own body \u2014 that's hitting myself! DEAD. \u274c\n\nSo only two safe moves: DOWN to (8,8) or LEFT to (7,9). RIGHT is deadly, UP is off-board.\n\nNow, which is better? Let's consider the apple at (6,9) \u2014 it's on the top row, column 6. If I go LEFT to (7,9), next turn I can go LEFT to (6,9) and eat that apple, growing to length 3 and getting my 3rd apple (tying score 3-3). That's aggressive and perfect for the \"grow as a means of dominating the board\" rule. Meanwhile, DOWN to (8,8) doesn't lead to an immediate apple; the nearest apples from there are maybe (5,5) or (6,4) but they're far and I'd have to navigate through the board, potentially getting boxed in by the enemy.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy's likely move. Enemy at (6,8) with body trailing left on row 8. He might move UP to (6,9) to eat that apple? That would be a smart move for him \u2014 he'd grow and get closer to my territory. If I move LEFT to (7,9) and he moves UP to (6,9), we won't collide because he's at (6,9) and I'm at (7,9) \u2014 different cells. But if he moves RIGHT to (7,8)? That's possible but less likely since (6,9) has an apple. Actually, from his perspective, (6,9) is directly above him, so he might try for that apple. If he does, and I move LEFT to (7,9), we're both on row 9 but separated. Good.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8,8), I'm entering the main area. The enemy might move RIGHT to (7,8) or UP to (6,9). If he moves RIGHT to (7,8), then we're at (8,8) and (7,8) \u2014 not colliding. But it puts me closer to his body on row 8, which could be risky in future turns if I get trapped.\n\nAlso, long-term strategy: I'm in the top-right corner. The enemy is on the left side (row 8, columns 3-6). By moving LEFT, I start moving towards the center, which is good for controlling the board and cutting off the enemy's potential routes. The apple at (6,9) is a clear target; after eating it, I could continue LEFT to (5,9) or DOWN to (6,8), but (6,8) is enemy head's current position, so not safe immediately. However, after I grow, my tail won't move, so I'll have more space.\n\nTactical note: The enemy has 3 apples, I have 2. If I eat the apple at (6,9), I tie. But more importantly, by positioning myself on row 9, I can potentially block the enemy from accessing the top row apples if he tries to go there later.\n\nConsider head-on collision: If I go LEFT to (7,9) and he goes UP to (6,9), no collision. If he goes RIGHT to (7,8), we're at (7,9) and (7,8) \u2014 still no collision. So LEFT seems safe.\n\nDOWN to (8,8): If enemy goes UP to (6,9), fine. If he goes RIGHT to (7,8), then we're at (8,8) and (7,8) \u2014 adjacent, not colliding. But if he goes RIGHT to (7,8) and I stay, next turn he might move UP or something, but it's less clear.\n\nAlso, the board has many apples, but rule says focus on enemy, not apples. However, growing is key. By moving LEFT, I set up for an apple next turn, which is aggressive growth. By moving DOWN, I'm not immediately growing.\n\nMoreover, after moving LEFT, my body will shift: head to (7,9), old head (8,9) becomes body, and tail (9,8) moves? Wait, when I move, my whole body shifts: head moves to new cell, old head becomes new body segment, and tail moves if I didn't eat an apple. Since I didn't eat an apple this turn (no apple at (7,9)), my length stays the same, so tail moves from (9,8) to (9,9)? Actually, careful: my body is currently [(9,9), (9,8)] with head at (8,9). After moving LEFT to (7,9), the new body becomes [(8,9), (9,9)] and tail becomes (9,9)? Wait, that seems off. Let's think: Initially, head at (8,9), body list: first body is (9,9), second is (9,8). So the body is in order: head -> (9,9) -> (9,8). When I move LEFT, head goes to (7,9). The old head (8,9) becomes the new first body segment. The previous body segments shift: (9,9) becomes second body, (9,8) becomes third? But since I didn't eat, the tail (9,8) moves off? Actually, in snake mechanics, when you move without eating, your tail disappears, so the body length stays the same. So new body should be [(8,9), (9,9)] and the old tail (9,8) is removed. So new body length is 2, same as before. So after moving LEFT, my body will be at (8,9) and (9,9), with tail at (9,9). That means I'll have a body segment at (9,9) still, which is the corner. That's fine.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8,8), new head at (8,8), old head (8,9) becomes body, and tail moves off (9,8), so new body: [(8,9), (9,9)], tail at (9,9). Similar.\n\nBut with LEFT, I'm positioning for the apple at (6,9) next turn. With DOWN, I'm in the open but no immediate apple target.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy's length: 4, mine: 2. If I grow to 3, I'm still shorter, so I shouldn't force a head-on collision yet. But by getting to row 9, I might be able to corner him later.\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (7,9) to set up for the apple at (6,9) next turn. This keeps me in the top row, gives me a clear objective, and avoids the denser middle area where the enemy is currently.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move LEFT to (7,9) now, then next turn go LEFT to (6,9) to eat the apple and tie the score. After that, consider moving DOWN to (6,8) or further LEFT to (5,9) depending on enemy position. Aim to control the top row and force the enemy into a tight spot.\n\nLet's GOOOO! \ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

So my target apple is gone. That's fine, we'll find another.\n- **Other apples:** (7, 2), (3, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4), (3, 4), (3, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 6), (5, 5), (6, 1), (5, 0), (9, 3), (0, 3), (8, 8). Note: There's an apple at (8, 8) \u2014 that's directly BELOW my current head! Also, (5, 5) and (6, 4) are in the mid-board.\n\n**EVALUATE MY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (7, 9):**\n1. **UP to (7, 10)** \u2014 OFF BOARD! Dead. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (7, 8)** \u2014 Check safety: My body is at (8,9) and (9,9). (7,8) is not occupied by me. Enemy body? At (6,8), (5,8), etc. (7,8) is empty. Enemy head is at (6,9), not at (7,8). So SAFE. Also, there's an apple at (8,8) \u2014 not at (7,8), but going DOWN puts me one step closer to it. From (7,8), next turn I could go RIGHT to (8,8) and eat that apple.\n3. **LEFT to (6, 9)** \u2014 Is it safe? My body is at (8,9) and (9,9). (6,9) is not occupied by me. BUT enemy head is NOW at (6,9)! If I move LEFT to (6,9) and the enemy stays there or moves, we'd have a head-on collision if he also stays at (6,9). Even if he moves away, simultaneous movement means if he moves OUT of (6,9) while I move INTO it, we might not collide? Wait, rules: Two heads moving into the same cell = both die. But here, he's already at (6,9). If I move INTO (6,9) while he's there, that's my head moving into his head's cell \u2014 that's a head-on collision! Both die. That's bad because I'm shorter (2 vs 5 apples) and we'd both die, ending the game possibly with him winning on apple count. So this move is HIGHLY RISKY and could lead to mutual death. Not worth it. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 9)** \u2014 Check safety: My body includes (8,9) right now? Wait, my body is [(8,9), (9,9)]. So (8,9) is my first body segment. Moving RIGHT into (8,9) would be hitting my own body \u2014 DEAD. \u274c\n\nSo only SAFE move is DOWN to (7,8). LEFT is deadly due to enemy head, RIGHT is into my own body, UP off board.\n\n**STRATEGY:** Moving DOWN to (7,8) is the only live option. From there, I can target the apple at (8,8) next turn. That apple is close and safe. After eating it, I'll grow to length 3 and get my 3rd apple, closing the gap to 3-5.\n\nAlso, from (7,8), I have multiple follow-up options: RIGHT to (8,8) for apple, DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8) but (6,8) is enemy body, so avoid that. So RIGHT is best after eating.\n\nThe enemy is on row 9 at (6,9). He might move DOWN to (6,8) or LEFT to (5,9) or RIGHT to (7,9). If he moves RIGHT to (7,9), that's where my head was last turn \u2014 but I'm moving down, so no collision. If he moves DOWN to (6,8), that's his own body? Actually, his body is at (6,8) already? Wait, his body includes (6,8) as the first segment after head. So if he moves DOWN to (6,8), he'd hit his own body \u2014 he'd die! That's good for us. But he's smart, he probably won't do that. He might move LEFT or UP (but UP is off board). So he'll likely move LEFT to (5,9) or DOWN to (6,8) if he wants to die.\n\nI'll assume he moves LEFT to (5,9) to stay on top row.\n\nMy plan: Move DOWN to (7,8) now, then next turn go RIGHT to (8,8) to eat the apple and grow. After that, I can continue exploring the board, maybe go DOWN or LEFT to find more apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Control the center-right of the board. Use the apple at (8,8) to grow, then move towards the cluster of apples in the middle (like (5,5), (6,4)). Keep an eye on the enemy \u2014 he's on the top-left, so we can box him in by taking the center and top-right. If we get more apples than him, we can force a collision later.\n\nLet's go! \ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Let's break it down LIVE!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- **My head:** (7, 8) \u2014 We're now at the center-right, one step below the top row.\n- **My body:** [(7, 9), (8, 9)] \u2014 Tail at (9, 9) (since body is HEAD-TO-TAIL, the last one is tail). Wait, careful: Snake list is HEAD-TO-TAIL: first is head, each connects to previous, last is tail. So my head is (7,8), body is [(7,9), (8,9)]? Actually from previous, my head was (7,9) and body [(8,9), (9,9)]. After moving DOWN to (7,8), my new head is (7,8), and the old head (7,9) becomes first body segment, and old body [(8,9), (9,9)] shifts. So new body: [(7,9), (8,9)]? Wait, need to confirm: The tail (9,9) might move if we didn't grow. Since we didn't eat an apple last turn (apple at (8,8) is still there), we didn't grow, so the tail moves forward. So after moving DOWN, the new snake is: Head (7,8), then old head (7,9), then old body (8,9), and tail (9,9) is gone? Actually, with no growth, the tail moves: new tail becomes the old second-to-last segment. So from old body [(8,9), (9,9)], after moving, the new body is [(7,9), (8,9)] and tail is (8,9)? Wait, that's confusing. Let's think: Initial snake at turn 10: head (7,9), body [(8,9), (9,9)] (tail at 9,9). After moving DOWN to (7,8) without eating, the snake shifts: new head (7,8), new body: old head (7,9) + old body (8,9) = [(7,9), (8,9)], and tail is (8,9)?? No, tail should be the last segment: (8,9) is now the last body segment, so tail is (8,9). But the body list is [(7,9), (8,9)] with head (7,8). So positions: head (7,8), body (7,9), tail (8,9). That means (9,9) is now empty. Good.\n\n- **Enemy snake #0:** Head: (5,9), Body: [(6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8)] \u2014 Apples: 4. From the board state, enemy is at top row, column 5, with body stretching down and left. No apple at (6,9) anymore (enemy ate it last turn).\n\n- **Apples:** Still many on board: (7,2), (3,2), (5,3), (6,4), (3,4), (3,1), (0,1), (1,0), (1,6), (5,5), (6,1), (5,0), (9,3), (0,3), (8,8). The apple at (8,8) is directly RIGHT from my head! That's our target.\n\n- **Score:** Me: 2 apples, Enemy: 4 apples (but likely 5 now? Wait, scoreboard says 4, but last turn they ate (6,9). Hmm, maybe the scoreboard hasn't updated? Actually, the scoreboard shows \"Snake #0 apples: 4\" but they ate an apple last turn, so should be 5. Might be a display lag, but we'll assume they have at least 4, possibly 5. We need to catch up.\n\n**EVALUATE MY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (7,8):**\n1. **UP to (7,9)** \u2014 Check safety: My body includes (7,9) right now? Yes! (7,9) is my first body segment. Moving UP into my own body = DEAD. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (7,7)** \u2014 Check safety: Is (7,7) occupied? My body: (7,9), (8,9) \u2014 no. Enemy body: (6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8) \u2014 no. So SAFE. Also, no apple there, but keeps options open.\n3. **LEFT to (6,8)** \u2014 Check safety: Enemy body includes (6,8)! Yes, enemy body has (6,8). Moving LEFT into enemy body = DEAD. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (8,8)** \u2014 Check safety: Is (8,8) occupied? My body: (7,9), (8,9) \u2014 no. Enemy body: no. So SAFE. And there's an apple at (8,8)! If I move here, I EAT the apple, grow to length 3, and get +1 apple (now 3 apples, closing gap to 3 vs 4/5). This is perfect! Also, from (8,8), I'll have more options next turn.\n\n**STRATEGY:** Moving RIGHT to (8,8) is the best move. It's safe, eats an apple, grows us, and positions us on the top-right edge. After eating, my body will be [(7,8), (7,9)] (tail at (7,9)? Wait, after growing, tail stays, so body becomes [(7,8), (7,9)]? Actually, when eating, we grow: new head (8,8), old head (7,8) becomes first body, old body [(7,9), (8,9)] stays, so new body: [(7,8), (7,9), (8,9)], tail at (8,9). That's length 4? Wait, initial length was 3 (head + 2 body). After eating, length becomes 4. Yes.\n\nFrom (8,8), next turn I can go DOWN to (8,7), LEFT to (7,8) (which is now my body? Wait, after growth, (7,8) will be my body, so can't go there), or UP to (8,9) (which is my tail? Actually, (8,9) will be my tail, so moving UP into tail? That's moving backwards into own body? If I move from (8,8) UP to (8,9), and (8,9) is my tail, but the tail will move away if I don't eat? Actually, careful: After eating, my snake is head (8,8), body [(7,8), (7,9), (8,9)]. If I next turn move UP to (8,9), that's moving into my own tail? But the tail will move forward if I don't eat, so it might be safe? However, the rules say moving into any snake's body (including your own) is dead. So moving into (8,9) when it's my body segment = DEAD. So from (8,8), I cannot go UP. I can go DOWN to (8,7) or RIGHT to (9,8) (off board? (9,8) is on board, x=9,y=8). So I'll have options.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat apple at (8,8) now. Then from (8,8), move RIGHT to (9,8) or DOWN to (8,7) to explore. The enemy is on the top-left; we're on top-right. We can start circling the board to control more space. Once we have more apples than enemy, we can try to box him in on the left side.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT to eat the apple and grow. Let's go! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Chat, don't let me throw!\n\n2. **DOWN to (7,7)** \u2705\n   - Safe! No own body, no enemy body. But no apple here either. Open space below.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6,8)** \u274c\n   - Enemy body is there! (6,8) is occupied by snake #0. Moving into enemy = DEAD.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8,8)** \u2705\n   - SAFE! No own body (my body is at (7,9) and (8,9)), no enemy body. AND there's an apple! This is our move! Eat and grow!\n\n**STRATEGY:** Moving RIGHT to (8,8) is the play! We eat the apple, grow to length 4, and get our score to 4 apples (tying with enemy's reported 4, though they might have 5). This positions us perfectly in the top-right corner, ready to control more space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating at (8,8), next turn we'll have more options. From (8,8), we could go RIGHT to (9,8) to explore the right edge, or DOWN to (8,7) to start circling downward. We need to keep applying pressure and force the enemy into a tight spot while we grow our lead. Let's keep the aggression high!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT to eat that apple and level the score! Let's goooo! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Score: We have 3 apples, Enemy has 4 apples. We need to close that gap and apply pressure. Let's break down the moves from our current position.\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **Our head:** (9,8)\n- **Our body:** [(8,8), (7,8), (7,9)] (from last turn we ate at (8,8), so we grew. Tail is still at (7,9)? Wait, no: We moved from (7,8) to (8,8) (ate apple), so new head is (8,8). The description in last move rationale said we were at (7,8) before moving RIGHT. The board state provided in the prompt shows our snake at (9,8) as head, with body (8,8), (7,8), (7,9). That's correct: after moving RIGHT from (7,8) to (8,8) (eating), we grew, so body becomes [(7,8), (7,9)]? Wait, careful. The provided board state says: Head (9,8), Body: [(8,8), (7,8), (7,9)]. That implies head moved to (9,8) this turn? No, the prompt says \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (9,8)\". That's the current state after last turn. But our last move was RIGHT from (7,8) to (8,8) (according to the replay). There's a discrepancy. Let's check the prompt's \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):\" section: It says Head: (9,8), Body: [(8,8), (7,8), (7,9)]. That suggests we are at (9,8) now. Did we move RIGHT from (8,8) to (9,8) this turn? No, the last move was for turn 12, and the scoreboard is for turn 13? The prompt says \"Turn: 13 / 150\". So we are about to make move for turn 13. The board state reflects the state after turn 12. Our head is at (9,8). That means in turn 12, we moved RIGHT from (8,8) to (9,8). But the last move rationale said we were at (7,8) before turn 12 and moved RIGHT to (8,8). That's inconsistent. Possibly the last move was RIGHT from (8,8) to (9,8) (if we were already at (8,8) from earlier). However, the provided board state clearly shows head (9,8), body (8,8), (7,8), (7,9). So we are at (9,8). Let's accept that. The apple we ate might have been at (8,8) or (9,8)? The apple list includes (9,3) etc. Anyway, we need to move from (9,8) now.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (9,8):**\n\n1. **UP to (9,9)** \u2705\n   - Check coordinates: (9,9) is within board (0-9). \n   - Own body: Our body is (8,8), (7,8), (7,9). (9,9) is not occupied by our body. \n   - Enemy body: Enemy snake #0 head (3,9), body [(4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (6,8)]. (9,9) is free.\n   - Is there an apple? Not listed in apple drops for (9,9). But that's fine.\n   - Safe? Yes. However, we must consider enemy movement. Enemy is far away. \n   - Future options: From (9,9) we can only go DOWN to (9,8) (which will be our own tail if we move away? Actually tail moves after we move, but we must avoid moving into our own body). Also we could go LEFT to (8,9). That's two options. Not trapped.\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,7)** \u2705\n   - Coordinates (9,7) valid.\n   - Own body: Not there. \n   - Enemy body: Not there.\n   - Apple? Not listed for (9,7). \n   - Future options: From (9,7) we can go UP (9,8) which will be our previous head, LEFT (8,7), DOWN (9,6). That's three options. Good.\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,8)** \u274c\n   - (8,8) is occupied by our own body (first segment after head). Moving into own body = DEAD. So invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,8)** \u274c\n   - Off board (x=10 > 9). Dead.\n\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe moves.\n\nNow we need to choose between UP and DOWN based on strategy. We want to dominate the board, force the enemy into a trap, and grow our score. Enemy has 4 apples, we have 3. We need to eat an apple soon. Are there any apples reachable? Looking at apple list: (7,2), (3,2), (5,3), (6,4), (3,4), (3,1), (0,1), (1,0), (1,6), (5,5), (6,1), (5,0), (9,3), (0,3), (4,1). None are immediately adjacent to us at (9,8) except maybe (9,3) is far down. So no immediate apple.\n\nWe need to position ourselves to cut off the enemy. The enemy is on the left side of the top row: head (3,9), body stretching to (6,9), (6,8). They are in the top-left quadrant. Our snake is on the right side (9,8). We could move UP to (9,9) to claim the top-right corner, then maybe move LEFT along the top row to chase apples and block the enemy from expanding right. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (9,7) opens up the right side and possibly down toward apples like (9,3) later.\n\nConsider enemy's possible moves. They might be trying to go down or right. If we go UP, we occupy (9,9) which is a corner. That's a safe spot but might limit our mobility. If we go DOWN, we have more mobility.\n\nAlso consider the \"grow as a means of dominating the board\" directive. We need to eventually eat apples. But we also need to force enemy into a crash. With our score lower, we shouldn't force a head-on collision yet. We need to increase our score first.\n\nBut we don't have apples nearby. So we need to move toward apples. Which apple is closest? From (9,8), the closest apple might be (9,3) (distance 5 vertical), or (5,5) (distance sqrt( (9-5)^2 + (8-5)^2 ) = sqrt(16+9)=5), or (6,4) etc. Not immediate.\n\nWe should also consider the board edges: we are near the right edge. Moving DOWN along the right edge might be safer than moving UP into a corner where we could get trapped. If we go UP to (9,9), then next turn we can only go DOWN or LEFT. If we go DOWN to (9,7), we have three options, keeping our future open.\n\nGiven the advice to \"keep future options OPEN\", moving DOWN seems better because it gives more mobility (three safe directions vs two). Also moving DOWN brings us closer to apples like (9,3) and (5,5) etc.\n\nNow, also consider the enemy's potential to cut us off. They are on the left; moving DOWN doesn't expose us to immediate danger. We should also think about the \"grow as a means of dominating the board\" \u2013 we might want to move toward an apple, but none are close. So we need to position ourselves to be ready to grab an apple next turn.\n\nLet's check if there is any apple we can reach in one move from (9,7) or (9,9). From (9,9), the adjacent cells are (9,8), (8,9), (9,10 invalid). No apples. From (9,7), adjacent: (9,8), (9,6), (8,7). No apples either. So no apple in one move regardless.\n\nThus the decision is about positioning.\n\nI think moving DOWN to (9,7) is the better strategic move. It keeps options open and moves us toward the central area where apples are. Also, moving DOWN might allow us to later go LEFT across the board and potentially block the enemy's expansion or intercept them.\n\nMoreover, the enemy is on the top row; moving DOWN reduces the chance of a head-on collision with them in the immediate turn (they might move down as well, but we'll be at (9,7) vs they are at (3,9) far away). So it's safe.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move DOWN to (9,7) to stay mobile. Next turn, consider moving LEFT to (8,7) to start moving toward the center and look for apples. We need to start accumulating apples to match the enemy's score. Avoid getting trapped in the corner; we want to use the right edge as a boundary but not get stuck.\n\nLet's go!\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze the battlefield after our last move.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **Our head:** (9,7) after moving DOWN last turn (correctly from (9,8) \u2013 confirmed we're at (9,7) now).\n- **Our body:** [(9,8), (8,8), (7,8)] (tail remains (7,8)? Wait, after moving DOWN from (9,8) to (9,7), we grew, so body becomes [(8,8), (7,8), (7,9)]? Actually, we didn't eat an apple this turn, so tail moves forward. The previous tail (7,9) might shift. But the board state will reflect current positions. We'll trust the upcoming board state after this move.)\n- **Score:** We have 3 apples, Enemy has 4. We're still behind, but we're alive and hunting.\n- **Enemy:** Snake #0 at (3,8) head, body [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9)]. They are on the left side, still not immediate threat.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (9,7):**\n\n1. **UP to (9,8)** \u2013 This is our previous head position, which is now part of our body (since we moved DOWN). Moving into our own body = DEAD. \u274c\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,6)** \u2013 Valid coordinate. Check occupancy: Our body includes (9,8) and (8,8), (7,8) \u2013 not (9,6). Enemy body: Not there. Apple? Looking at apple list: (9,3) is an apple, but (9,6) is empty. Safe move. Good future options: From (9,6), we can go UP (9,7) (previous head), DOWN (9,5), LEFT (8,6). Three options, keeps mobility. Also moves us closer to apple at (9,3) (distance 3 now). \u2705\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,7)** \u2013 Valid. Check occupancy: (8,7) is not in our current body (head (9,7), body (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)). Enemy body: Not there. Safe. Future options: From (8,7), we can go RIGHT (9,7), LEFT (7,7), UP (8,8) which is our body? Wait, (8,8) is our body (segment after head). So moving UP from (8,7) to (8,8) would be into our own body = DEAD. That reduces future options because UP is deadly. So from (8,7), only RIGHT and LEFT are safe (DOWN? (8,6) is empty, so actually DOWN is also safe). Let's recalc: from (8,7), possible moves: RIGHT (9,7) safe, LEFT (7,7) safe, DOWN (8,6) safe (assuming no body there), UP (8,8) into body = DEAD. So still three safe options. However, LEFT moves us toward the center and apples like (5,5) or (6,4). That could be good. But also puts us closer to enemy territory? Enemy is at (3,8) far left, so not immediate.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,7)** \u2013 Off board, DEAD. \u274c\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN (9,6) and LEFT (8,7).\n\n**STRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- We need to grow to match the enemy's score. The closest apples are (9,3) directly below us (3 cells down), and (5,5) a bit left. Moving DOWN takes us straight toward (9,3) and also keeps us along the right edge, which is a safe boundary. However, moving too far down into the corner might trap us later if we go to (9,0) and need to turn back.\n- Moving LEFT to (8,7) moves us toward the center, where more apples are clustered (5,5, 6,4, 3,4, etc.). This could give us more opportunities to eat multiple apples and potentially cut off the enemy's path.\n- The enemy is on the top-left; moving LEFT could set us up to intercept them if they move down. But we're still far apart.\n- **Future mobility:** From (9,6), we have UP, DOWN, LEFT. From (8,7), we have RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN. Both give three options, but from (8,7) we also have UP as a dead end (into own body). Actually from (8,7), UP is (8,8) which is our body segment, so that's a trap. So (9,6) might be slightly better for future options because all three directions are likely open (assuming no body at (9,5) or (8,6)). But we need to check body positions: after moving DOWN to (9,6), our body will be (9,8), (8,8), (7,8) \u2013 no conflict with (9,5) or (8,6). So (9,6) offers more freedom.\n\n- **Content considerations:** Moving DOWN brings us closer to apple (9,3) \u2013 we could reach it in three moves (9,6 \u2192 9,5 \u2192 9,4 \u2192 9,3). Moving LEFT to (8,7) doesn't directly approach an immediate apple, but (5,5) is 3 steps away (Manhattan distance 6). However, moving LEFT could also lead to (6,4) or (3,4) later.\n\n- **Risk assessment:** The enemy might move DOWN or RIGHT, but they're far. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n- **Long-term plan:** We need to eat apples quickly. The apple at (9,3) is the most straightforward. If we go DOWN, we can secure that apple soon, gaining a point and growing. That would tie our score (4-4) and make us more aggressive. Then we can move LEFT across the board, using our length to block the enemy or force them into a corner.\n\n- **Aggression:** Our score is lower, so we shouldn't force a head-on collision yet. We should focus on growing. The apple at (9,3) is safe and reachable without much interference.\n\n**DECISION:** I'll move DOWN to (9,6). This keeps us on the right edge, moves us toward an apple, and maintains good mobility.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:** Head down to (9,6), then (9,5), (9,4), (9,3) to eat the apple there. That will tie our score at 4 apples. After that, we'll turn LEFT and start moving across the board to the center, hunting more apples and positioning to cut off the enemy's escape routes. Stay alert for enemy movements\u2014watch for them trying to flank us from the top.\n\nLet's go get that apple! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

The board is packed with apples, but we're hunting the enemy's head, not just fruit. We need to grow and dominate space.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **Our head:** (9,6)\n- **Our body:** (9,7), (9,8), (8,8) \u2014 so moving UP to (9,7) is DEATH into our own body.\n- **Enemy head:** (3,7) at left, body wrapping along top: (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9). They're not immediately threatening, but if they move RIGHT, they could start closing in.\n- **Apples nearby:** (9,3) is 3 steps down\u2014prime target. (5,5) is central but farther. We want the quick apple to tie the score and grow.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (9,6):**\n\n1. **UP to (9,7)** \u2013 into our own body (segment behind head). INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,5)** \u2013 Valid coordinate. Check occupancy: (9,5) is empty (no body parts, no enemy body). Apple? Not listed there (closest apple is (9,3) down the line). SAFE. Future options: From (9,5), we can go UP (9,6) (back to current), DOWN (9,4), LEFT (8,5). All three likely safe\u2014no immediate traps. Moving DOWN also gets us closer to that apple at (9,3). Good for growing. \u2705\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,6)** \u2013 Valid. (8,6) is empty (not in our body: (9,7),(9,8),(8,8)). Enemy not there. SAFE. Future options: From (8,6), we can go RIGHT (9,6), LEFT (7,6), UP (8,7), DOWN (8,5). Four options? Wait, (8,7) might be empty, (8,5) empty. That's great mobility. But does it get us to an apple faster? The nearest apple from (8,6) is (6,1) or (5,5)\u2014still several steps away. Also, moving LEFT brings us closer to the center, where the enemy is lurking. Could set up a confrontation later, but we're not ready since we're behind in score.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,6)** \u2013 Off board, DEAD. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\n- We need apples to catch up and grow. The apple at (9,3) is the most accessible\u2014straight down from here. Taking it in 3 turns (9,6\u21929,5\u21929,4\u21929,3) gives us +1 apple and +1 body segment, tying the score 4-4 and expanding our control over the right edge.\n- Moving DOWN maintains our position on the boundary, which is safer long-term\u2014less risk of getting boxed in by the enemy if we stay near the wall.\n- LEFT is tempting for mobility, but it doesn't immediately advance our growth goal. Plus, if the enemy moves RIGHT this turn, we might be stepping closer to their territory without a clear advantage.\n- The enemy likely won't challenge us right away\u2014they're busy with their own apples (maybe targeting (4,1) or (0,3)). We should focus on our own growth to become more aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Secure the apple at (9,3) over the next few turns. Once tied (4-4), turn LEFT and sweep across the board to cut off the enemy's paths. Use our growing length to trap them if they venture right. Watch for their head movements\u2014any sign of them coming down, we pivot to head-on collision (but only when we're equal or ahead).\n\n**LET'S MOVE:** DOWN to (9,5)\u2014chasing that apple and keeping options open! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nDOWN",

INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,4)** \u2013 Valid coordinate. Check occupancy: (9,4) is empty (no body, no enemy). Not an apple, but leads us straight toward (9,3). SAFE.

Once we tie, we can turn LEFT and sweep, using our length to trap them if they chase apples on the bottom or left.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO MY FUTURE SELF:** Secure the apple at (9,3) over turns 16-18 (DOWN\u2192DOWN\u2192DOWN? Wait, 9,5\u21929,4\u21929,3\u2014that's two moves if we go DOWN twice). Actually, from (9,5) DOWN to (9,4), then DOWN to (9,3) eats the apple. After that, tie score 4-4, body grows to (9,4). Then pivot LEFT to (8,3) or (8,4) to start sweeping the board, hunting more apples while watching enemy moves. If they come right, force collision when we're equal or ahead.

UP would collide with your own neck (3,7), so it's off the table.\n\nHigh-level rationale: we want to keep a tight corridor along x=3 to pressure the middle of the board, stay clear of the rival\u2019s path on the far right, and position to grab the apple at (3,4) soon to extend the lead while avoiding risky head-ons.\n\nShort-term plan: stay on the 3-column corridor, monitor opponent\u2019s choices, and look for a cross-path opportunity later while preserving at least two safe follow-ups.\n\nLong-term plan note: keep the corridor strategy flexible\u2014if the rival overcommits, pivot to create a controlled head-on when the apples and board geometry favor us; otherwise, drain space and force late-game traps around the center.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy is still at (3,5) with body [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. We're behind in apples 3 vs 4, but we're closing in on that apple at (9,3) \u2013 just one more DOWN and we eat to tie it up! Board is still open, but we need to be smart about our moves to avoid getting boxed in or crashing.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **Our head:** (9,4) \u2013 right edge, safe.\n- **Our body:** (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) \u2013 so moving UP to (9,5) is hitting ourselves. DEAD.\n- **Enemy head:** (3,5) \u2013 they could go UP to (3,6) (their own body? Wait, (3,6) is their body segment, so they can't go there unless suicidal), DOWN to (3,4) (apple! \ud83c\udf4e), LEFT to (2,5), or RIGHT to (4,5). They're likely chasing that apple at (3,4) or probing right.\n- **Apples:** (9,3) is right below us \u2013 perfect target. (3,4) is theirs to grab, but we don't care about chasing that now.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (9,4):**\n\n1. **UP to (9,5)** \u2013 INTO OUR OWN BODY (segment right behind head). INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,3)** \u2013 Valid coordinate. (9,3) has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Eat it, grow to 4 apples, tie the score 4-4, body becomes [(9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)]. SAFE \u2013 no enemy there. Future options: From (9,3), we can go UP (9,4), DOWN (9,2) (empty? Check board: (9,2) is empty), LEFT (8,3) (empty). Good mobility, keeps us on edge. This is the power move \u2013 grow now, dominate later. \u2705\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,4)** \u2013 Valid. (8,4) is empty (not our body, not enemy). SAFE. Future options: From (8,4), we can go RIGHT (9,4), LEFT (7,4), UP (8,5), DOWN (8,3). Four options, solid freedom. But it delays grabbing that apple, letting enemy possibly catch up or us miss the tie. Also, moving left brings us closer to the center where enemy might be heading \u2013 risky if they go RIGHT this turn.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,4)** \u2013 Off board, DEAD. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\n- We need to tie that score ASAP! DOWN to (9,3) eats the apple, grows our body, and sets us up to tie 4-4. It's safe, direct, and keeps us on the edge to box out the enemy long-term. No point delaying \u2013 we're hunters, not campers.\n- LEFT is okay for flexibility, but we'd miss the apple and end up at (8,4) with no growth. Enemy might grab an apple and extend their lead. Not acceptable when we're behind.\n- Once we eat, we'll have a longer body and can pivot LEFT to sweep the board, forcing the enemy into tight spots. If they come right, we'll be ready for a head-on collision once we're equal or ahead \u2013 but for now, let's grow!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO MY FUTURE SELF:** Turn 17: DOWN to eat apple at (9,3), tie score 4-4. Turn 18: From (9,3), likely LEFT to (8,3) to start sweeping leftward, hunting more apples while watching enemy moves. If enemy moves right toward us, we prepare to cut them off and force a collision when our length advantage kicks in. Stay aggressive \u2013 we're dominating this board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**LET'S MOVE:** DOWN to eat that apple and tie the score! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nDOWN",

Now we're at head (9,3) with body [(9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)]. Enemy snake #0 at (3,4) probably just ate the apple there (since it was at (3,5) last turn and moved DOWN to (3,4)? Wait, let's check: they were at (3,4) according to the scoreboard last turn? Actually, last turn's board showed enemy at (3,4) with body [(3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. And apple at (3,4) was there? Wait, no \u2013 looking back, in last turn's rationale, I said enemy at (3,5) chasing apple at (3,4), but the board shows snake #0 at (3,4) already? Wait, hold on \u2013 in the CURRENT board state at turn 18, snake #0 head is at (3,4), body [(3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. So they must have moved there and possibly ate an apple? Wait, but the apple list shows (3,4) as an apple drop? Actually, the apple list is historical drops, but the current board shows apples as 'A' \u2013 I see (3,4) has '0' (snake head), not 'A', so maybe they ate it last turn? Anyway, they're at (3,4) now, we're at (9,3). Score 4-4. Time to get aggressive!\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **Our head:** (9,3) \u2013 bottom-right corner area. Good spot, on the edge.\n- **Our body:** (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) \u2013 so moving UP to (9,4) would hit our own body segment (since (9,4) is directly above). That's suicidal.\n- **Enemy head:** (3,4) \u2013 center-left. Their body stretches up to (3,9). They might move towards more apples like (5,5) or (6,4) etc., but they could also try to flank us.\n- **Apples:** There's one at (9,2) directly below us! (Check board: row 2 has 'A' at (9,2)? Wait, row 2: \". . . A . . . A . .\" \u2013 (9,2) is last character? Row index 2: positions 0-9: 0:'.',1:'.',2:'.',3:'A',4:'.',5:'.',6:'.',7:'A',8:'.',9:'.' \u2013 so (9,2) is empty. Actually, wait: row 2 (y=2) is the third line from bottom? Let's map: row 9 top, row 0 bottom. The board lines:\n  9: . A . T . . . . . .  (positions 0-9)\n  8: . . . T . . . . . .\n  7: . . . T . . . . . T\n  6: . A . T . . . . . T\n  5: . . . T . A . . . T\n  4: . . . 0 . . A . . T\n  3: A . . . A A . . . 1   <-- we're at (9,3) which is '1'? Wait, (9,3) is the last character in row 3: \"A . . . A A . . . 1\" \u2013 yes, we're there.\n  2: . . . A . . . A . .   <-- (9,2) is last char: '.' empty.\n  1: A . . A A A . A . .   <-- (9,1) is '.' empty.\n  0: . A . . . A . . . .   <-- (9,0) is '.' empty.\nSo below us: (9,2) empty, (9,1) empty, (9,0) empty. Left: (8,3) is '.' empty (row 3: \"A . . . A A . . . 1\" \u2013 position 8 is '.'? Wait, positions: 0:A,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:A,5:A,6:.,7:.,8:.,9:1 \u2013 so (8,3) is '.' indeed. Up: (9,4) is our own body segment 'T' (from body list). Right: off board (10,3) dead.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (9,3):**\n\n1. **UP to (9,4)** \u2013 INTO OUR OWN BODY (body segment right above). INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,2)** \u2013 Valid coordinate, empty. SAFE. Future options: From (9,2), we can go UP (9,3) (just came from there, but it's now empty? Wait, after we move, (9,3) becomes part of body? Actually, when we move, our head leaves (9,3) and it becomes body segment (unless we eat an apple and grow). So from (9,2), UP to (9,3) would be into our own body if we didn't grow? Wait, no: if we move DOWN to (9,2) and don't eat an apple (since (9,2) is empty), then our body shifts: new head (9,2), body becomes [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)] \u2013 so (9,3) is now body segment. So from (9,2), moving UP to (9,3) would hit our own body! That's bad. But other moves: LEFT (8,2) \u2013 (8,2) is '.' empty (row 2: position 8 is '.'), DOWN (9,1) empty, RIGHT off board. So from (9,2), we'd have 3 safe options (LEFT, DOWN, but not UP). Actually, UP is blocked by our own body after the move, so only 2 viable directions? Wait, no: from (9,2), possible moves: UP (9,3) - body (bad), DOWN (9,1) - empty (good), LEFT (8,2) - empty (good), RIGHT off board (dead). So 2 safe options. That's okay but not great.\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,3)** \u2013 Valid, empty. SAFE. Future options: From (8,3), we can go RIGHT (9,3) (empty after we leave), LEFT (7,3) \u2013 (7,3) is 'T'? Wait, row 3: position 7 is '.'? Actually, row 3: \"A . . . A A . . . 1\" \u2013 positions: 0:A,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:A,5:A,6:.,7:.,8:.,9:1. So (7,3) is '.' empty. UP (8,4) \u2013 row 4: \" . . . 0 . . A . . T \" \u2013 position 8 is '.'? Actually, row 4: positions: 0:.,1:.,2:.,3:0,4:.,5:.,6:A,7:.,8:.,9:T. So (8,4) is '.' empty. DOWN (8,2) \u2013 row 2: position 8 is '.' empty. So from (8,3), we'd have 4 safe options! That's excellent mobility \u2013 keeps future options wide open.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,3)** \u2013 Off board, DEAD. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\n- We need to stay aggressive and open up the board. LEFT to (8,3) gives us 4 safe follow-up moves, while DOWN to (9,2) only gives 2 (and we'd be cornering ourselves in the bottom-right with our body blocking UP). Moving LEFT brings us closer to the center where apples are (like (6,4), (5,5), etc.) and keeps us on the edge to potentially box in the enemy if they move right.\n- We just ate an apple, so no need to rush another immediately. Better to maneuver and set up a position where we can dominate space and force the enemy into a trap. Our body is already long (5 segments), so we can afford to sweep left and cut off the enemy's path.\n- Long-term: From (8,3), we can head towards the cluster of apples in the center-left (e.g., (5,5), (6,4)) while watching the enemy. If they move towards us, we can prepare for a head-on collision once we're confident (maybe after eating another apple to grow even longer). Remember, if we have higher score, we can force collisions \u2013 but it's tied now, so we need to grow more first.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO MY FUTURE SELF:** Turn 18: LEFT to (8,3) to gain mobility and approach center apples. Next turn, from (8,3), likely UP to (8,4) or LEFT to (7,3) to chase the apple at (6,4) or (5,5), depending on enemy movement.

Others are safe for now; no immediate cross-collision with opponent this turn.\n3) Pick path that preserves options and pressures the board: DOWN keeps a tight vertical pressure, while LEFT/RIGHT open a broader play later.\n4) Favor moves that prevent trapping ourselves while keeping future apples and angles open.\n\nPlan / Strategy Note:\n- Short-term: stay in the vertical corridor as long as it serves pressure, then pivot to threaten a cross-path or corner trap if the rival slips into a mistake.\n- Medium-term: avoid unnecessary detours toward apples if it opens a line for the opponent to slip past or to force a head-on when it benefits our score lead. Use the corridor to bait the rival toward the center or toward the edge, then squeeze from a safer angle.\n- Endgame mindset: if the rival drifts into a risky line, be ready to pivot and collide head-on only if it guarantees survival and a net apples gain.\n\nBottom line: DOWN. \nDOWN",

The enemy snake #0 is still lurking at (3,3) with a body stretching up to (3,8). We're tied 4-5? Wait, no: our scoreboard says we have 4 apples and they have 5 \u2013 they must've grabbed another apple while we were moving! \ud83d\ude24 We need to catch up and dominate. They're in the center, we're at (8,3) \u2013 time to close the gap and box them in!\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **Our head:** (8,3) \u2013 solid position, not trapped.\n- **Our body:** [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)] \u2013 still wrapped along the right edge. Good for defense.\n- **Enemy head:** (3,3) \u2013 center-left. Their body: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8)]. They're vertical along x=3.\n- **Apples:** There's an apple at (6,4) close to us, and another at (5,5) \u2013 but we're ignoring apples unless they're in our path. Focus on cutting off enemy escape routes!\n- **Key threats:** If we crash into enemy body or head, we die. If enemy head moves into our body, they die. If heads collide, both die. Since we're behind in score (4 vs 5), we should avoid head-on collision unless we're sure to grow faster or force a mistake.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (8,3):**\n\n1. **UP to (8,4)** \u2013 Valid, empty (row 4: position 8 is '.'). SAFE. Future options: From (8,4), we can go DOWN (8,3) (empty after we leave), LEFT (7,4) \u2013 (7,4) is '.' (row 4: position 7 is '.'), RIGHT (9,4) \u2013 but (9,4) is our body segment! That's a no-go. UP (8,5) \u2013 (8,5) is '.' (row 5: position 8 is '.'). So 3 safe options. Good for advancing towards center apples like (6,4) and (5,5). Also, this moves us north, potentially cutting off enemy's upward path if they go right.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,2)** \u2013 Valid, empty (row 2: position 8 is '.'). SAFE. Future options: From (8,2), UP (8,3) (empty after), DOWN (8,1) \u2013 (8,1) is 'A'? Row 1: \". . . A A A . A . .\" \u2013 position 8 is '.'? Wait, row 1: positions 0-9: 0:.,1:.,2:.,3:A,4:A,5:A,6:.,7:A,8:.,9:. So (8,1) is '.' empty. LEFT (7,2) \u2013 row 2: position 7 is 'A'? Row 2: \". . . A . . . A . .\" \u2013 position 7 is 'A' (apple). So LEFT to (7,2) would be an apple! That's a growth opportunity. RIGHT (9,2) \u2013 (9,2) is '.' empty. So from (8,2), we have 4 safe options, including grabbing an apple at (7,2). But (7,2) is closer to enemy territory? Not sure. This keeps us low, possibly safer from enemy moving right.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7,3)** \u2013 Valid, empty (row 3: position 7 is '.'). SAFE. Future options: From (7,3), RIGHT (8,3) (empty after), LEFT (6,3) \u2013 (6,3) is 'A'? Row 3: position 6 is '.'? Row 3: \"A . . . A A . . . 1\" \u2013 positions: 0:A,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:A,5:A,6:.,7:.,8:.,9:1. So (6,3) is '.' empty. UP (7,4) \u2013 row 4: position 7 is '.' empty. DOWN (7,2) \u2013 row 2: position 7 is 'A' (apple). So again 4 safe options, and LEFT to (6,3) gets us closer to the apple cluster. This also moves us towards the enemy's vertical line \u2013 if they go right, we can meet them head-on or cut them off.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9,3)** \u2013 Valid, empty (we just left it, and no apple there). SAFE. BUT: Moving back to where we came from? That's potentially a bad habit, and from (9,3), we previously had limited options (only 2 safe moves). It's a safe move, but it reduces our future mobility. Also, it keeps us on the right edge, which might not help box in the enemy. Avoid going backwards unless necessary.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\n- We need to aggressively chase the enemy and grow to surpass their score. Moving LEFT to (7,3) or UP to (8,4) brings us closer to the center where apples and the enemy are. DOWN to (8,2) might be too passive, keeping us low while the enemy is in the middle.\n- Consider enemy movement: They're at (3,3) \u2013 they might go RIGHT to (4,3) (apple at (4,1)? Wait, (4,3) is apple at (4,3)? Row 3: position 4 is 'A' \u2013 yes, there's an apple at (4,3)! So enemy might eat that and grow, pulling further ahead. If we move LEFT to (7,3), we're closer to intercepting if they go right. If we go UP to (8,4), we can head towards (6,4) apple and be ready to flank.\n- From (7,3), we can immediately go LEFT to (6,3) next turn (empty) and then towards (5,5) or (6,4). This seems like the most aggressive path \u2013 claiming space in the center.\n- Also, our body is blocking the right edge, so moving LEFT opens up the board for us. The enemy's body is vertical, so if we move left and up, we can potentially trap them against their own body or the left wall.\n- LONG-TERM PLAN: Turn 19: LEFT to (7,3) to push into the center. Next turn, from (7,3), likely LEFT to (6,3) or UP to (7,4) to chase apples and close in on enemy. Monitor enemy's move \u2013 if they go right, we can head towards a collision once we've eaten an apple or two to grow longer. We're behind in score, so we need to eat quickly but safely. Box them in by using our body as a barrier on the right and advancing from the left. Dominate and force a mistake! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**LET'S MOVE:** LEFT to advance aggressively towards the center and cut off enemy routes! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake #0 is still chilling at (3,2) (wait, they moved? Let's check \u2013 no, the board shows their head at (3,2) now? Actually, the board shows: row 2, position 3 is '0' \u2013 yes, their head is at (3,2) with body [(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(3,8)]. They're moving down? Possibly chasing the apple at (4,1) or (3,1). We're at (7,3) with body: [(8,3),(9,3),(9,4),(9,5)]. Our body is still on the right edge. We need to push into the center and force them into a trap. Let's evaluate moves.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK (TURN 20 START):**\n- Our head: (7,3) \u2013 safe, empty.\n- Our body: (8,3) (9,3) (9,4) (9,5) \u2013 all clear.\n- Enemy head: (3,2) \u2013 they might go DOWN to (3,1) (apple at (3,1)!), LEFT to (2,2) (empty), RIGHT to (4,2) (empty?), or UP to (3,3) (their own body! That's suicide, so probably not). So they'll likely eat that apple and grow.\n- Apples around: (6,4), (5,5), (4,1), (3,1) \u2013 but we ignore apples unless in path. Focus: box them in. Their body is vertical at x=3 from y=2 to 8. We're at x=7. We need to close the gap.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (7,3):**\n1. **UP to (7,4)** \u2013 Empty (row 4: pos7 '.'). SAFE. From there, options: LEFT (6,4) apple! (we could eat next), RIGHT (8,4) empty, DOWN (7,3) empty, UP (7,5) empty. 4 safe options. Moves us up towards center and apples. Good for advancing.\n2. **DOWN to (7,2)** \u2013 Empty? Row 2: \". . . A . . . A . .\" \u2013 pos7 is 'A' (apple). So we'd eat an apple and grow! But is it safe? Let's see future: from (7,2), UP (7,3) empty, LEFT (6,2) empty, RIGHT (8,2) empty, DOWN (7,1) (row1: pos7 'A' apple). So 4 safe options plus apple.

This moves us directly towards enemy's x=3 line \u2013 we could flank them from left. Aggressive, cuts off their escape.\n4. **RIGHT to (8,3)** \u2013 Empty (we just left). SAFE but moving back to where we were? From (8,3), LEFT (7,3) empty, RIGHT (9,3) empty, UP (8,4) empty, DOWN (8,2) empty. 4 safe options, but we're just repositioning on edge. Less aggressive.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\n- Enemy is at (3,2) and likely eating (3,1) to grow to 7 apples. We need to match growth and trap them. Their body is blocking x=3 from y=2 up. If we move LEFT to (6,3), we step into the center-left zone, threatening to cut their path if they go right. From (6,3), next move could be LEFT to (5,3) for apple, or UP to (6,4) for apple \u2013 both grow us while advancing. This boxes them in against their own body or left wall.\n- DOWN to (7,2) gets us an apple but delays closing the gap. UP to (7,4) is safe but less direct toward enemy. RIGHT is passive.\n- LONG-TERM PLAN: Turn 20: LEFT to (6,3) to push into center and set up for apple grabs. Next turn, from (6,3), likely LEFT to (5,3) or UP to (6,4) to eat and grow. Monitor enemy \u2013 if they go right, we meet them head-on once we're longer. Force collision when we have score lead. Box them in by advancing from left while our body blocks right. DOMINATE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**LET'S MOVE:** LEFT to aggressively advance towards the center and cut off enemy routes! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nLEFT",

Their body is vertical from (3,2) to (3,8). They're growing fast, but we're faster! We need to close the gap and box them in.\n\nBoard recap:\n- My head: (6,3) \u2013 after my last LEFT move, I'm now at (6,3). Body: [(7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4)].\n- Enemy head: (3,1) \u2013 they ate the apple, so they're longer. They might go LEFT to (2,1), DOWN to (3,0), RIGHT to (4,1), or UP to (3,2) (their own body! risky). Probably LEFT or DOWN to chase another apple.\n- Apples around: (5,3) left of me, (6,4) above, (4,1) near enemy, (5,5) etc. But focus: trap enemy.\n\nEVALUATING MOVES FROM (6,3):\n- **UP to (6,4)** \u2013 Empty? Row 4: \". . . T . . A . . .\" \u2013 pos6 is 'A' (apple!). SAFE. Eat apple \u2192 grow to 5 apples! From there, options: LEFT (5,4) empty, RIGHT (7,4) empty, DOWN (6,3) empty, UP (6,5) empty?

All 4 directions safe. This grows us, moves toward center, and we can flank enemy from above.\n- **LEFT to (5,3)** \u2013 Empty? Row3: \"A . . . A A . . . 1\" \u2013 pos5 'A' (apple!). SAFE. Eat \u2192 grow to 5 apples! From there, options: LEFT (4,3) empty? Row3 pos4 'A'? Actually row3: pos0 'A',1 '.',2 '.',3 '.',4 'A',5 'A',6 '.',7 '.',8 '.',9 '1' (me). So (5,3) is apple, (4,3) is 'A'? Wait, pos4 is 'A'? Row3: \"A . . . A A . . . 1\" \u2013 that's A (0), . (1), . (2), . (3), A (4), A (5), . (6), . (7), . (8), 1 (9). So (4,3) is 'A' (apple). So from (5,3), LEFT to (4,3) would be apple, RIGHT (7,3) empty, UP (5,4) empty, DOWN (5,2) empty. All safe. This moves us left toward enemy's territory, good for boxing.\n- **DOWN to (6,2)** \u2013 Empty? Row2: \". . . A . . . A . .\" \u2013 pos6 is '.' (empty). SAFE. From there, options: LEFT (5,2) empty, RIGHT (7,2) 'A'? Row2 pos7 'A' (apple), UP (6,3) empty, DOWN (6,1) 'A'? Row1 pos6 'A' (apple). So safe but no immediate apple. Keeps us low, less aggressive.\n- **RIGHT to (7,3)** \u2013 Empty (we just left). SAFE but we were just there. From there, options similar to before: UP (7,4) empty, DOWN (7,2) apple, LEFT (6,3) empty, RIGHT (8,3) empty. But this doesn't advance toward enemy; we're looping on the right edge. Passive.\n\nSTRATEGY DECISION:\nWe need to grow fast to catch up to enemy's 7 apples. Both UP to (6,4) and LEFT to (5,3) give us an apple immediately\u2014grow to 5 apples. Which is better? LEFT to (5,3) moves us closer to enemy's x=3 line (only 2 steps away horizontally), setting up a flank from the left. UP to (6,4) moves us upward but keeps us farther horizontally. Since enemy is low at y=1, and we want to box them in against their own body and the left wall, LEFT is more aggressive. From (5,3), next turn we can eat another apple at (4,3) or push further left to cut their escape routes. Meanwhile, monitor enemy\u2014if they go RIGHT, we can head-on them once we're longer.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Turn 21: LEFT to (5,3) to eat apple and advance leftward. Turn 22: LEFT to (4,3) for another apple (6 apples total). This forces enemy into a corner at x=3. If they try to go right, we meet them head-on with a growing lead.

If we can coax him into a gap between our wall and the edges, we can force a head-on collision or trap him as he dodges. Stay bigger than him, win the trades, and steer him into our corridor for the knockout when the apple lead favors us.\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s break down the board and make a killer move.\n\nFirst, our current position: We\u2019re at (5,3). Our body is [(6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4)]. We\u2019re not going backwards into ourselves, so that\u2019s safe. Now, we need to check each move to avoid immediate death and dominate the board.\n\n**Evaluating moves from (5,3):**\n\n1. **UP to (5,4):**  \n   - Board says row 4 (y=4): \u201c. . . T . . A . . .\u201d So (5,4) is '.' (empty).  \n   - Not out of bounds.  \n   - Safe from own body (we\u2019re not moving into our tail because the tail is far at (9,4)).  \n   - Enemy #0 is at (4,1) with a vertical body along x=3. Their head is at (4,1), so they could move up to (4,2), down to (4,0), left to (3,1) (but that\u2019s their own body, so risky), or right to (5,1). They\u2019re not at (5,4).  \n   - But wait: If we go up, we might be closer to the center, but there\u2019s an apple at (6,4) that\u2019s attractive. However, from (5,4), we could go right to (6,4) next turn to eat it. But is this the best move?  \n   - Future safety: From (5,4), we could go UP (5,5) which is empty (row5: pos5 is \u2018A\u2019 but that\u2019s (5,5)? Actually row5: \u201c. . . T . A . A . .\u201d So (5,5) is 'A' (apple!). That\u2019s good, but we\u2019d eat next turn. Left to (4,4) is empty (row4 pos4 is '.'), down to (5,3) is where we are now (but that\u2019s our body after we move? We need to check). Actually, after moving up, (5,3) becomes our body, so going down back to it would be into our own body\u2014dangerous. But other directions look open. So UP gives us options, but not immediate apple.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5,2):**  \n   - Board row 2 (y=2): \u201c. . . A . . . A . .\u201d So (5,2) is '.' (empty).  \n   - Safe from bounds and own body.  \n   - Enemy still at (4,1) with body, no threat here.  \n   - From (5,2), future moves: UP (5,3) empty, DOWN (5,1) empty? Row1: \u201cA . . T 0 . A . . .\u201d So (5,1) is '.' (empty). LEFT (4,2) empty? Row2 pos4 is '.' (empty). RIGHT (6,2) empty (row2 pos6 '.'). This is safe but doesn\u2019t get us closer to an apple immediately. Apples near us: (6,1) at (6,1) but we\u2019re at (5,2), could go there next. (5,1) is empty, not apple. This is a defensive move, but we want aggression! We\u2019re behind, so we need to grow.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4,3):**  \n   - Board row 3 (y=3): \u201cA . . . A A . . . 1\u201d So (4,3) is 'A' (apple!).  \n   - SAFE! We eat an apple, grow to 6 apples!  \n   - Not out of bounds.  \n   - Own body? We\u2019re moving from (5,3) to (4,3). Our current body is [(6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4)]. (4,3) is not in our body. After moving, our new tail might move, but since we\u2019re eating an apple, we grow\u2014our tail doesn\u2019t move forward this turn. So no self-collision.  \n   - Enemy threat: Enemy head at (4,1). They could move UP to (4,2), DOWN to (4,0), LEFT to (3,1) (own body, dangerous), RIGHT to (5,1). None of these are (4,3) immediately. But if they go RIGHT to (5,1) and then up, they might come later, but for now, no head-on collision risk.  \n   - Future options: From (4,3), we can go LEFT to (3,3) but that\u2019s enemy body territory (their body is at x=3, y=1 to 8, so (3,3) is occupied by their tail segment). That would kill us! So LEFT is dangerous next turn. UP to (4,4) empty? Row4 pos4 is '.' (empty). DOWN to (4,2) empty (row2 pos4 '.'). RIGHT back to (5,3) empty (but that\u2019s our body after we move? We\u2019ll see). This move is risky for next turn because left is blocked by enemy. But we can avoid going left. We could go UP or DOWN to flank.  \n   - Overall: This grows us, moves us into enemy\u2019s horizontal space (closer to x=3), and sets up for aggressive play. We need to box them in! From here, we can push up or down to cut off their escape.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6,3):**  \n   - (6,3) is empty (we just moved from there last turn).  \n   - Safe from bounds.  \n   - Own body? Our body includes (6,3) as the first segment after head. If we move right from (5,3) to (6,3), we\u2019re moving into our own body (the segment that was behind us). That\u2019s a direct collision with ourselves! DEAD.  \n   - So this move is immediately lethal. Eliminate.\n\n**Safety Check Summary:**\n- RIGHT: DEAD (into own body).  \n- DOWN: SAFE.  \n- UP: SAFE.  \n- LEFT: SAFE (and eats apple).\n\nNow, among safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT), which maximizes growth and aggression?  \n- UP and DOWN are safe but no apple immediately. We\u2019re at 5 apples, enemy at 8\u2014we need to close the gap fast! Left gives us an apple, boosting us to 6 apples, and moves us leftward to dominate enemy territory.  \n- Long-term strategy: From (4,3), we need to avoid going left into enemy body. Instead, go UP to (4,4) or DOWN to (4,2) to flank the enemy\u2019s vertical line. Enemy is at x=3 with a long body; we\u2019re at x=4 now, cutting off their right side. We can force them into the left wall (x=0) or into their own tail.  \n- Also, consider enemy\u2019s potential move: If they go RIGHT to (5,1) and we\u2019re at (4,3), they might try to head-on later, but we\u2019ll be growing and can outmaneuver. If they go LEFT or DOWN, they\u2019re more trapped.  \n- DOWN is less aggressive\u2014we stay on the right, not closing the horizontal gap. UP is neutral. LEFT is the play: eat, grow, advance.\n\n**MY MOVE: LEFT** \u2013 It gives us an apple, puts us in prime position to box in snake #0. Let\u2019s go for 6 apples and show chat who\u2019s boss!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Turn 22: LEFT to (4,3) to eat apple and grow. Turn 23: If enemy moves, we\u2019ll assess\u2014likely UP to (4,4) or DOWN to (4,2) to flank, avoiding left into their body. Goal: Cut off their escape to the right and force them into the wall. We\u2019re the predator now! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

LEFT is suicidal (hits our neck).\n\nMy pick is UP. It keeps our nifty x=3 barrier intact and nudges us toward the apple cluster at (4,3) next turn.\n\nLong-term vibe: build a stubborn central barrier along x=3, push toward Snake #1, and use apple growth to widen the corridor so we can force a head-on or corner trap when the apples tilt in our favor.\n\nWhy not RIGHT? That breaks the wall and gives him room to dodge; DOWN gives less pressure and growth this turn.\n\nSafety check: we stay off his body, avoid backing into our own neck, and keep multiple safe follow-ups in case he pivots toward us.\n\nPlanned tempo: advance UP, secure the near apple, and wait for an opening to pin him between the wall and the edge.\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s break down the board and map out our killer move to box in snake #0.  \n\n**Board context:**  \n- Our head: (4,3)  \n- Our body: [(5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4)] (tail at (9,4))  \n- Enemy #0: Head at (4,2), body along x=3 from y=1 to y=7. They\u2019re vertical and trapped on the left.  \n- Apples nearby: (4,4) is empty, (4,1) is empty, (3,3) is enemy body (danger!), (5,3) is our body (can\u2019t go back).  \n- Our score: 6 apples. Enemy: 8. We MUST grow and force a head-on collision on our terms.  \n\n**Evaluating moves from (4,3):**  \n1. **UP to (4,4):**  \n   - Board row 4 (y=4): \u201c. . . T . . A . . .\u201d So (4,4) is '.' (empty).  \n   - Safe from bounds, own body (we\u2019re not moving into (5,3) or others), and enemy bodies (enemy at x=3, not x=4).  \n   - Enemy head at (4,2) could move UP to (4,3) (our current spot) but we\u2019re moving away, so no head-on clash this turn.  \n   - Future options: From (4,4), we can go LEFT (4,3) (empty after we leave), RIGHT (5,4) (empty, leads to apple at (6,4)), UP (4,5) (empty? row5 pos4 is '.'), or DOWN back to (4,3). Multiple exits\u2014no trap!  \n   - Aggression: This moves us up, cutting off enemy\u2019s potential upward escape. We\u2019re flanking their vertical line, forcing them toward the left wall. Perfect for boxing them in.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (4,1):**  \n   - Board row 1 (y=1): \u201cA A . T T . A . . .\u201d So (4,1) is 'T'\u2014enemy tail segment! That\u2019s snake #0\u2019s body.  \n   - Moving into enemy body = INSTANT DEATH. Eliminate.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (3,3):**  \n   - Board row 3 (y=3): \u201cA . . . A A . . . 1\u201d So (3,3) is 'T'\u2014enemy body (their third segment).  \n   - Moving into enemy body = DEATH. Eliminate.  \n\n4. **RIGHT to (5,3):**  \n   - (5,3) is empty? Wait, our body includes (5,3) as the first segment after head. Since we\u2019re at (4,3), moving right to (5,3) would hit our own body (the segment we just left behind last turn).  \n   - Moving into own body = DEATH. Eliminate.  \n\n**Safety Check Summary:**  \n- UP: SAFE!  \n- DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT: DEADLY (into enemy or own body).  \n\n**Only safe move is UP.** This is huge\u2014no alternatives, so we MUST take it. It keeps us alive, avoids collisions, and positions us to dominate the board. From (4,4), we can continue flanking the enemy, possibly going right to (5,4) next turn to chase the apple at (6,4) or up to (4,5) to control space. Enemy is now trapped between x=0-3; we\u2019re at x=4, ready to squeeze them out.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Turn 23: UP to (4,4) to secure position. Turn 24: If enemy moves left/down, we go RIGHT to (5,4) to grab the apple at (6,4) and grow. Goal: Force enemy into the left wall or into their own tail, then deliver the head-on KO when we\u2019re ahead in score.
