You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game, represented by ASCII art.\n2. The objective of the game is for your snake to grow bigger while navigating through coordinate-based boards with multiple apples and obstacles.\n3. Each successful movement that allows your snake to consume an apple adds a point to your score.\nYour objective is to maximize the number of points you accumulate based on those rules.\nHere are some definitions and rules in the existing code:\n- The game runs using a visual representation of a board, where X, XYY, and YY symbols are used to denote specific sections of the board and special points, which are hidden.\n- Each turn involves movement and scoring until an operator halts the program or an operator kills the snake before game termination. Movement is achieved by sending a text input of either \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\", which determines the direction of motion.\n- The initial board position is represented by a 10x10 grid with a starting point at [0,0]. Players are asked to input \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\" before each turn.\nThe game logic and data structure of the program are subject to minor changes and the new board is created with 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\nThe new game board is going to be 10x10, being represented by either a 0, X, XYY, or XXYY.\n\nHere is a table of the possible coordinates for the game:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",

You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game, represented by ASCII art.\n2. The objective of the game is for your snake to grow bigger while navigating through coordinate-based boards with multiple apples and obstacles.\n3. Each successful movement that allows your snake to consume an apple adds a point to your score.\nYour objective is to maximize the number of points you accumulate based on those rules.\nHere are some definitions and rules in the existing code:\n- The game runs using a visual representation of a board, where X, XYY, and YY symbols are used to denote specific sections of the board and special points, which are hidden.\n- Each turn involves movement and scoring until an operator halts the program or an operator kills the snake before game termination. Movement is achieved by sending a text input of either \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\", which determines the direction of motion.\n- The initial board position is represented by a 10x10 grid with a starting point at [0,0]. Players are asked to input \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\" before each turn.\nThe game logic and data structure of the program are subject to minor changes and the new board is created with 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\nThe new game board is going to be 10x10, being represented by either a 0, X, XYY, or XXYY.\n\nHere is a table of the possible coordinates for the game:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",

The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. However, the snake cannot move onto its own body or into a square that has already been occupied.\n\nAt this moment, the snake is on the following coordinates in order:\n\n0,0\n0,1\n1,1\n1,0\n\nHere is a visual representation of the game board:\n\n\\\\displayshapest=\n//Image:SnakeGameBoard.png\n\nYou have just made the following function call with the JSON parameter:\n\n```\n{\n    \"move\": {\n        \"direction\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYour task is to modify the parameter to specify the snake's next move.

Each successful movement that allows your snake to consume an apple adds a point to your score.\nYour objective is to maximize the number of points you accumulate based on those rules.\nHere are some definitions and rules in the existing code:\n- The game runs using a visual representation of a board, where X, XYY, and YY symbols are used to denote specific sections of the board and special points, which are hidden.\n- Each turn involves movement and scoring until an operator halts the program or an operator kills the snake before game termination. Movement is achieved by sending a text input of either \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\", which determines the direction of motion.\n- The initial board position is represented by a 10x10 grid with a starting point at [0,0]. Players are asked to input \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\" before each turn.\nThe game logic and data structure of the program are subject to minor changes and the new board is created with 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\nThe new game board is going to be 10x10, being represented by either a 0, X, XYY, or XXYY.\n\nHere is a table of the possible coordinates for the game:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",

The snake is represented by an orange O and its body parts are denoted by an orange #. The game board is a grid of 4x4 squares, and the snake's goal is to reach the coordinates (3,3). The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. However, the snake cannot move onto its own body or into a square that has already been occupied.\n\nAt this moment, the snake is on the following coordinates in order:\n\n0,0\n0,1\n1,1\n1,0\n\nHere is a visual representation of the game board:\n\n\\\\displayshapest=\n//Image:SnakeGameBoard.png\n\nYou have just made the following function call with the JSON parameter:\n\n```\n{\n    \"move\": {\n        \"direction\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYour task is to modify the parameter to specify the snake's next move.

You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game, represented by ASCII art.\n2. The objective of the game is for your snake to grow bigger while navigating through coordinate-based boards with multiple apples and obstacles.\n3. Each successful movement that allows your snake to consume an apple adds a point to your score.\nYour objective is to maximize the number of points you accumulate based on those rules.\nHere are some definitions and rules in the existing code:\n- The game runs using a visual representation of a board, where X, XYY, and YY symbols are used to denote specific sections of the board and special points, which are hidden.\n- Each turn involves movement and scoring until an operator halts the program or an operator kills the snake before game termination. Movement is achieved by sending a text input of either \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\", which determines the direction of motion.\n- The initial board position is represented by a 10x10 grid with a starting point at [0,0]. Players are asked to input \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\" before each turn.\nThe game logic and data structure of the program are subject to minor changes and the new board is created with 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\nThe new game board is going to be 10x10, being represented by either a 0, X, XYY, or XXYY.\n\nHere is a table of the possible coordinates for the game:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",

The snake is represented by an orange O and its body parts are denoted by an orange #. The game board is a grid of 4x4 squares, and the snake's goal is to reach the coordinates (3,3). The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. However, the snake cannot move onto its own body or into a square that has already been occupied.\n\nAt this moment, the snake is on the following coordinates in order:\n\n0,0\n0,1\n1,1\n1,0\n\nHere is a visual representation of the game board:\n\n\\\\displayshapest=\n//Image:SnakeGameBoard.png\n\nYou have just made the following function call with the JSON parameter:\n\n```\n{\n    \"move\": {\n        \"direction\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYour task is to modify the parameter to specify the snake's next move.

However, I am unclear about your intention to represent the board. Could you provide a brief explanation on how the board should be displayed? Additionally, your request to format the result in white space is not clear to me. Do you mean for me to follow certain spacing rules when responding to you?

Each successful movement that allows your snake to consume an apple adds a point to your score.\nYour objective is to maximize the number of points you accumulate based on those rules.\nHere are some definitions and rules in the existing code:\n- The game runs using a visual representation of a board, where X, XYY, and YY symbols are used to denote specific sections of the board and special points, which are hidden.\n- Each turn involves movement and scoring until an operator halts the program or an operator kills the snake before game termination. Movement is achieved by sending a text input of either \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\", which determines the direction of motion.\n- The initial board position is represented by a 10x10 grid with a starting point at [0,0]. Players are asked to input \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\" before each turn.\nThe game logic and data structure of the program are subject to minor changes and the new board is created with 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\nThe new game board is going to be 10x10, being represented by either a 0, X, XYY, or XXYY.\n\nHere is a table of the possible coordinates for the game:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",

You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game, represented by ASCII art.\n2. The objective of the game is for your snake to grow bigger while navigating through coordinate-based boards with multiple apples and obstacles.\n3. Each successful movement that allows your snake to consume an apple adds a point to your score.\nYour objective is to maximize the number of points you accumulate based on those rules.\nHere are some definitions and rules in the existing code:\n- The game runs using a visual representation of a board, where X, XYY, and YY symbols are used to denote specific sections of the board and special points, which are hidden.\n- Each turn involves movement and scoring until an operator halts the program or an operator kills the snake before game termination. Movement is achieved by sending a text input of either \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\", which determines the direction of motion.\n- The initial board position is represented by a 10x10 grid with a starting point at [0,0]. Players are asked to input \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\" before each turn.\nThe game logic and data structure of the program are subject to minor changes and the new board is created with 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\nThe new game board is going to be 10x10, being represented by either a 0, X, XYY, or XXYY.\n\nHere is a table of the possible coordinates for the game:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",

You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game, represented by ASCII art.\n2. The objective of the game is for your snake to grow bigger while navigating through coordinate-based boards with multiple apples and obstacles.\n3. Each successful movement that allows your snake to consume an apple adds a point to your score.\nYour objective is to maximize the number of points you accumulate based on those rules.\nHere are some definitions and rules in the existing code:\n- The game runs using a visual representation of a board, where X, XYY, and YY symbols are used to denote specific sections of the board and special points, which are hidden.\n- Each turn involves movement and scoring until an operator halts the program or an operator kills the snake before game termination. Movement is achieved by sending a text input of either \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\", which determines the direction of motion.\n- The initial board position is represented by a 10x10 grid with a starting point at [0,0]. Players are asked to input \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\" before each turn.\nThe game logic and data structure of the program are subject to minor changes and the new board is created with 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\nThe new game board is going to be 10x10, being represented by either a 0, X, XYY, or XXYY.\n\nHere is a table of the possible coordinates for the game:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",

You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game, represented by ASCII art.\n2. The objective of the game is for your snake to grow bigger while navigating through coordinate-based boards with multiple apples and obstacles.\n3. Each successful movement that allows your snake to consume an apple adds a point to your score.\nYour objective is to maximize the number of points you accumulate based on those rules.\nHere are some definitions and rules in the existing code:\n- The game runs using a visual representation of a board, where X, XYY, and YY symbols are used to denote specific sections of the board and special points, which are hidden.\n- Each turn involves movement and scoring until an operator halts the program or an operator kills the snake before game termination. Movement is achieved by sending a text input of either \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\", which determines the direction of motion.\n- The initial board position is represented by a 10x10 grid with a starting point at [0,0]. Players are asked to input \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\" before each turn.\nThe game logic and data structure of the program are subject to minor changes and the new board is created with 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\nThe new game board is going to be 10x10, being represented by either a 0, X, XYY, or XXYY.\n\nHere is a table of the possible coordinates for the game:\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
