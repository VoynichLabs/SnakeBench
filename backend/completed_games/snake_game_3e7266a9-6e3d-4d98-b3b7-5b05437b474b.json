Both are directly below me.\n\nThe closest apple I can reach in one move (distance 1) is none, but moves towards A2 and A5 are DOWN (to (1, 6)) or potentially LEFT/RIGHT and then DOWN.\n\nEnemy snake head is at (0, 5).\n\n**Analyzing moves targeting the lower apples (1, 3) and (1, 2):**\n\n1. **DOWN to (1, 6):** This moves me closer to (1, 3) and (1, 2).\n   * Next turn, I could go DOWN again to (1, 5), then (1, 4), then (1, 3) to eat A2.\n   * How does the enemy move? They are relatively far. If Snake #1 moves UP to (0, 6), they are still far. If they move RIGHT to (1, 5), they are still not threatening.\n\n2. **LEFT to (0, 7):** This brings me next to the enemy head's column, but one level higher.\n   * Enemy turn: If Enemy #1 moves RIGHT to (1, 5), no collision.

Enemy head: (0, 5). No immediate threat.\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (for next turn safety check):**\nSnake #1 (Head at (0, 5)) has apples (1, 3) and (1, 2) relatively close to its current position if it moves right/down, but (1, 3) is closer to my path than its current position.\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (1, 5), it is 1 step away from (1, 6) where I will be next turn, but I will have moved.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 6).\nTurn 1 state: Me (1, 6), Snake #1 (0, 5).\n\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (0, 6). They are adjacent vertically.\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (1, 5). They are adjacent diagonally.\n\nSince my goal is to reach (1, 3) quickly, moving DOWN seems optimal for path reduction.\n\nCurrent Position (1, 7). Target (1, 3).\nMove sequence: DOWN -> (1, 6).\nNext turn: DOWN -> (1, 5).\nNext turn: DOWN -> (1, 4).\nNext turn: DOWN -> (1, 3) [Eat A2]. This takes 4 turns total if I keep going straight down.\n\nMoving UP or sideways delays reaching the closest apple cluster (1, 2) and (1, 3). Since I am short and alone (apart from one enemy far away), a direct approach is preferred.\n\nI will move DOWN.\n\nShort-term Plan: Move directly towards the nearest apple cluster at (1, 3) and (1, 2) by moving DOWN until reaching the y-level of 3 or 2, then adjust horizontally if necessary (though (1, X) seems like a favorable column to occupy). Ensure no threat from Snake #1 at (0, 5). Moving DOWN to (1, 6) keeps me safe from Snake #1 currently.\n\nDOWN moves to (1, 6). This is safe.\n\nDOWN",

This is safe.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nCurrent State Analysis (Turn 1 concluded, starting Turn 2):\nMy Head: (1, 6)\nEnemy #1 Head: (0, 4) (Since they chose DOWN in the previous simultaneous move implicitly, as they chose DOWN in their last move information, based on the provided data structure, I must assume the board state reflects the result of Turn 0 moves).\n\nLet's re-verify my current position based on the provided board state and last move:\nTurn: 1 / 150.\nMy last move was **DOWN** from (1, 7) to (1, 6). This matches the board state: '0' is at (1, 6).\nEnemy #1's last move was calculated based on Turn 0 starting state. The board shows Snake #1 head at (0, 4). If the snake at (0, 4) moved DOWN last turn, its previous position was (0, 5). If they moved UP, it was (0, 3). If they moved RIGHT, it was (0, 4) which means they stayed or moved LEFT. Given the relative positions and general strategy, it's most likely they were moving towards the lower apples as well, or just defensively. Since the rationale for my previous move assumes Snake #1 was at (0, 5) at the start of Turn 0/end of Turn -1, and the board shows (0, 4), it implies Snake #1 moved DOWN from (0, 5) to (0, 4) during the previous turn transition (which was turn 0 to 1).\n\nMy current position: (1, 6).\nEnemy #1 Head: (0, 4).\n\nApples remaining: (6, 6), (1, 3), (7, 6), (9, 8), (1, 2).\n\n**Safety Check (Move from (1, 6))**\nPossible moves: UP (1, 7), DOWN (1, 5), LEFT (0, 6), RIGHT (2, 6).\n\n1. **UP (1, 7):** Safe boundaries. No self-collision. Potential enemy collision: Enemy head at (0, 4) moving to (0, 5) (UP), (1, 4) or (0, 3) (DOWN), or (1, 4) (RIGHT). No immediate danger.\n2. **DOWN (1, 5):** Safe boundaries. No self-collision. This moves me closer to A2 (1, 3) and A5 (1, 2). Potential enemy collision: Enemy head at (0, 4) moving to (0, 5) (UP), (1, 4) or (0, 3) (DOWN), or (1, 4) (RIGHT). No immediate danger.\n3. **LEFT (0, 6):** Safe boundaries. No self-collision. Potential enemy collision: This square (0, 6) is adjacent to the enemy head (0, 4). If the enemy moves UP to (0, 5), we are safe. If they move LEFT to (-1, 4) (die), UP to (0, 5), DOWN to (0, 3), RIGHT to (1, 4). No immediate collision risk, but we move adjacent to them.\n4. **RIGHT (2, 6):** Safe boundaries. No self-collision. Moves towards A1 (6, 6) and A3 (7, 6). Potential enemy collision remains low.\n\n**Apple Proximity from (1, 6):**\nA2: (1, 3) -> Distance 3 (via 3 DOWN moves)\nA5: (1, 2) -> Distance 4 (via 4 DOWN moves)\nA1: (6, 6) -> Distance 5 (via 5 RIGHT moves)\nA3: (7, 6) -> Distance 6 (via 6 RIGHT moves)\n\nPath towards A2 (1, 3) is clearly the shortest route (3 more turns directly down).\n\nConsidering Enemy Movement:\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0, 4). They will choose a move simultaneously. They are also close to the lower apples (1, 3) and (1, 2). If they move DOWN to (0, 3), they are still far from me. If they move RIGHT to (1, 4), they are one step closer to intercepting my path to (1, 3). If they move UP to (0, 5), they are moving away from the apples below.\n\nIf I choose **DOWN to (1, 5)**:\nMy next turn 3 position will be (1, 5).\nEnemy's next turn position will be $E'$.\n\nIf Enemy chooses DOWN to (0, 3): Safe.\nIf Enemy chooses RIGHT to (1, 4): This cell (1, 4) is critical. On my next turn, I will aim for (1, 4). If the enemy occupies (1, 4) next turn, I cannot land there if they stay there on the subsequent turn. If they move to (1, 4) this turn, and I move to (1, 5), the potential collision point is (1, 4) on turn 3 (if I move down again). If the enemy stays at (1, 4) next turn OR moves to (1, 5):\nIf I move (1, 5) this turn. Enemy moves to (1, 4).\nNext turn (Turn 3): I move to (1, 4). Head-on collision if Enemy stays at (1, 4) OR moves to (1, 4) and I move to (1, 4).\n\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 4) this turn.\nMy move: DOWN to (1, 5).\nNext turn (Turn 3): I aim for (1, 4). If Enemy moves RIGHT again to (2, 4), I can safely enter (1, 4). If Enemy moves UP to (1, 5) they hit me. If Enemy moves DOWN to (1, 3), they get closer to the apple.\n\nThe immediate threat is competition for the column Y=3/Y=2. Since the space is open, direct pursuit is best unless an enemy blocks.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (1, 5)**: I'm on track for A2 (1, 3).\nIf Snake #1 follows me by moving RIGHT to (1, 4):\nTurn 3:\nI'm at (1, 5). Enemy is at (1, 4).\nI move DOWN to (1, 4). If Enemy moves UP to (1, 5) -> Collision. If Enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 4) -> I take (1, 4). Winner gets on track.\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (0, 6)**:\nThis slows down apple acquisition (Distance to A2 increases from 3 steps to 4 steps: (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 3) or (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (1, 3)). It also puts me adjacent to the enemy head (0, 4).\n\nIf I prioritize speed towards the closest apples ((1, 3) and (1, 2)), **DOWN (1, 5)** is the best choice. Since the board is wide open and the enemy is small and not directly threatening a collision square in the next move, aggressive pursuit of apples is warranted.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving DOWN the column Y=1 towards apples at (1, 3) and (1, 2). Maintain vigilance concerning Snake #1 positioning, especially if they begin to move towards X=1.\n\nMove: DOWN\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy current state is:\nHead: (1, 6)\nBody: none (Length 1)\nApples: 0\nTurn: 1\n\nEnemy Snake #1:\nHead: (0, 4)\nBody: none\nApples: 0\n\nApples available: (6, 6), (1, 3), (7, 6), (9, 8), (1, 2)\n\nBoard size: 10x10. Boundaries are 0 to 9 for both axes.\n\n**Goal:** Move towards the closest apple(s) safely. The closest apples are A2 at (1, 3) and A5 at (1, 2).\n\nPossible moves from (1, 6):\n1. **UP** to (1, 7): Moves away from targets. Distance to A2 increases by 1.\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 5): Moves directly toward A2 (1, 3) (Now 2 moves away). This is optimal pathing.\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 6): Puts me next to the enemy head (0, 4), delaying apple pursuit by 1 theoretical step + horizontal movement cost.\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 6): Moves towards the A1/A3 cluster, significantly increasing distance to A2/A5.\n\nSafety considerations: The enemy is at (0, 4). A move to (1, 5) seems safe. Enemy cannot reach (1, 5) next turn, nor can they collide with me in the next step. If the enemy moves to (1, 4) (RIGHT), I will plan to take (1, 4) next turn if they don't block it.\n\nChoosing DOWN maximizes progress towards the closest goals.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving DOWN the column Y=1 towards apples at (1, 3) and (1, 2). Maintain awareness of Snake #1's positioning.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

They need to counter my path to (1, 3).\n\nEnemy Moves from (0, 4):\n* UP to (0, 5): Moving away from the lower apples.\n* DOWN to (0, 3): Moving towards (1, 3) horizontally, but still one step away.\n* LEFT to (-1, 4): Off board (suicide).\n* RIGHT to (1, 4): This is the most aggressive intercept move, aiming for the space directly ahead of my path (1, 4).\n\nScenario A: I move DOWN to (1, 5). Enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 4).\nNext Turn (Turn 3): I am at (1, 5). Enemy is at (1, 4).\nI aim for (1, 4).

Enemy aims for (1, 3) or (2, 4).\nThis allows the enemy to immediately contest the lower apples uncontested by me.\n\nSince I established a very efficient path towards the closest apples in the previous turn, maintaining this direct line of advance is the highest priority, provided it remains safe. Moving DOWN to (1, 5) keeps the path open for the next 2 turns without immediate interception risk. If the enemy chooses to move RIGHT to (1, 4), they are using their first move to challenge my path, forcing me to adapt on Turn 3, but I've gained a step closer to A5 (1, 2) which might become the primary uncontested target if A2 is taken by the enemy.\n\nStaying on the path seems best.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue moving DOWN towards (1, 3) and (1, 2).

My body is empty (length 1). My last move was DOWN, so the previous head was $(1, 5)$, and my move before that was $(1, 6)$. My tail is conceptually at $(1, 5)$ if I had length 2+, but since I had length 1 at T2 start, my previous location $(1, 5)$ (where I came from) is safe to return to (backwards move).\n\nEnemy Snake #1 Head: $(1, 3)$. Body: $[(0, 3)]$. Length 2.\nEnemy's next move will be simultaneous.\n\nAvailable Apples: (6, 6), (7, 6), (9, 8), (1, 2), (6, 3).\n\nMy potential moves from $(1, 4)$:\n1. **UP to (1, 5):** Safe from self (backwards). Enemy at $(1, 3)$ moves away from me. Best safe move to continue pursuit towards $(1, 2)$.\n2. **DOWN to (1, 3):** **Eating Apple!** I move to $(1, 3)$, which is an apple location. If Snake #1 also moves to $(1, 3)$, we both die (Head-on collision).\n   * Snake #1 could move UP to $(1, 4)$ to try and intercept me at the apple. If Snake #1 moves UP to $(1, 4)$ and I move DOWN to $(1, 3)$, we do not collide.\n   * Snake #1 could move LEFT to $(0, 3)$, but $(0, 3)$ is its own body, so this is an illegal move for Snake #1 unless it eats something and grew, but it didn't eat last turn. *Wait, Snake #1's body is $[(0, 3)]$. If it moves to $(0, 3)$, it hits its own tail/body, so it must avoid $(0, 3)$.* Snake #1's head is $(1, 3)$. Its body is $[(0, 3)]$. If it moves LEFT to $(0, 3)$, it hits its body and dies.\n   * Snake #1's safe moves from $(1, 3)$ are UP to $(1, 4)$, RIGHT to $(2, 3)$, or perhaps diagonal moves off the board if applicable (not here).\n   * If I move DOWN to $(1, 3)$ (Apple), Snake #1 has two safe moves: $(1, 4)$ (UP) or $(2, 3)$ (RIGHT). Neither move causes a collision with me at $(1, 3)$. I successfully eat the apple and gain length. This looks like the best move if safe.\n3. **LEFT to (0, 4):** Safe. Enemy $(1, 3)$ is 1 unit away. If Snake #1 moves UP to $(1, 4)$, we create a gap. If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to $(2, 3)$, we are still separated. This move abandons the apple at $(1, 3)$ but keeps distance.\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 4):** Safe. Enemy $(1, 3)$ is 1 unit away. Same as LEFT, we just maneuver sideways.\n\n**Collision Check for DOWN to (1, 3) (Eating Apple A2):**\n*   My destination: $(1, 3)$ (Apple)\n*   Enemy #1 moves from $(1, 3)$.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to $(1, 4)$: No collision. I eat the apple.\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to $(2, 3)$: No collision. I eat the apple.\n    *   If Enemy moves DOWN to $(1, 2)$: No collision. I eat the apple and they move to the next apple.\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to $(0, 3)$: Enemy hits its own body $[(0, 3)]$ and dies. I eat the apple.\n\nSince moving DOWN to $(1, 3)$ is safe (it results in me eating an apple, and at worst, the enemy dies), this is the optimal move. It secures the apple and potentially eliminates an opponent without self-harm.\n\n**New Long-Term Plan Focus:** Secure the two apples near my current location A2 (1, 3) and A5 (1, 2). If Snake #1 dies, I focus on the remaining apples, likely prioritizing the closest cluster (6, 6) / (7, 6) next if the lower path is clear after eating (1, 2).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move DOWN to eat apple (1, 3). If successful, the next move will target (1, 2) hoping to secure another apple immediately. If Snake #1 survives, monitor its position relative to the remaining apples. If Snake #1 dies, prioritize eating (1, 2).\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN",
