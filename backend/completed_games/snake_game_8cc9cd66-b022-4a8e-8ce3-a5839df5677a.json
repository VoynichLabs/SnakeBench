It also preserves more open space around you rather than turning toward your own body\u2019s vicinity.\n- Considerations about enemies: Snake #1 is far at (0,6); its next move is unlikely to trap you this turn, and there\u2019s no immediate head-on risk with your chosen safe options.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Take UP to (3,1), then reassess apples and opponent moves.

From there, drop to y=8 near (6,8)/(6,7)/(8,8) to grab apples while keeping enough room to maneuver.\n- Avoid dropping into column 3 if enemy head starts advancing; prefer to drop at x\u22655 so I have side room to escape or circle.\n\nRIGHT",
