Our pathetic archrival Ledger #0 is down there at (3,0), minding his own tiny business with zero apples\u2014just whimpering like the noob he is. Score: us 0, him 0. Time to change that and DOMINATE this board before he can even blink! We gotta grow big, fast, and trap his scaly ass in a corner. No mercy, no quarter\u2014let's box him in and watch him crash out hard! \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udfc6\n\nAlright, chat, let's break this down like a pro gamer\u2014thinking sharp as my fangs! My head's at (0,2), no body yet, all fresh and ready to strike. Safe moves only: UP to (0,3) is clear, no bodies or edges to fear, opens up the whole left side for vertical control later. DOWN to (0,1) eats that juicy apple right away\u2014yum, +1 point, growth on the board for some early domination. But hold up, after that, options get tight: I could only go right next or down deeper, and down might lead to the bottom edge quick. Feeling trapped? Not my style! RIGHT to (1,2) also eats an apple, grows me, AND expands horizontally toward enemy territory\u2014where the real action is. Plus, from there (1,2), I'd have tons of follow-up moves: up, down, or more right into the heart of the board. No dead-ends here, chat, just pure expansion to crowd him out and set up head-on ambushes when I'm bigger! \ud83d\ude4c\n\nI'm picking RIGHT\u2014aggressive, growth-inducing, and keeps my options WIDE open like a boss strategy. Gonna eat that apple, pump up my size, and start closing in on his snake-y hideout. He'll think he's safe down there, but we're about to turn the tables! Watch this, viewers\u2014right's the way! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**START SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**  \nGet that apple, grow immediately, then keep moving right or up on row 2 to control the mid-board horizontally. Watch where enemy slithers\u2014if he heads up-right, flank him from above for a future collision when we\u2019ve got the score lead. Dominate space, eat nearby apples like (2,2) or (4,4) if paths cross, but always prioritize boxing his movement towards edges without letting him trap us! If he tries to dash away, cut him off ruthlessly. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc0d\n**END SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN: Our head\u2019s at (3,0)\u2014down would drop us to y=-1, off the board! That\u2019s a rookie throw, so we\u2019re nixing DOWN immediately \u274c. Who throws a game before turn 1? C\u2019mon, not us!\n2. LEFT: (2,0) is on the board, no body to crash into (we got zero segments besides our head), empty cell\u2014safe. But is this giving us clout?\n3. RIGHT: (4,0) is on the board, no body issues, empty cell\u2014safe. But is this moving us toward apples or the enemy?\n4. UP: (3,1) is on the board, no body issues, empty cell\u2014safe. Now this is where the plot thickens!\n\nSafe moves locked: LEFT, RIGHT, UP. Now let\u2019s level up\u2014we need moves that keep future options open, chase apples, and start boxing that enemy in! \ud83d\udea8\n\nAren\u2019t we here to grow and dominate? Let\u2019s check apple proximity: The (2,2) apple is nearby\u2014if we blast UP to (3,1), next turn we can pivot toward that apple to gain a length advantage (hello, better collision leverage!). LEFT or RIGHT keep us stuck on the y=0 bottom edge, no immediate apple access\u2014why trap ourselves there when we can rise up? \ud83e\udd37\u2642\ufe0f\n\nFuture options check: UP to (3,1) gives us THREE follow-up safe moves (up to 3,2, left to 2,1, right to 4,1) \u2014 that\u2019s flexibility to pivot if the enemy tries to box us in! LEFT to (2,0) only gives two decent follow-ups (up to 2,1, right to 3,0) and pins us to the bottom. RIGHT to (4,0) is the same vibe\u2014stuck on the edge with limited escape routes.\n\nEnemy plotting time: That enemy\u2019s at (0,2)\u2014we need to close the y-gap to start boxing them in later, right? UP starts that ascent\u2014we\u2019re not hiding, we\u2019re hunting! Isn\u2019t it time we make that enemy sweat? \ud83e\udd28\n\nLong-term strategy note (future self): After moving UP to (3,1), your next move should prioritize the (2,2) apple to gain a length advantage\u2014once you have more segments, you can force a head-on collision (since higher score means we win that double KO) or box the enemy into a corner with your longer body. Avoid getting pinned to edges (y=0 or x=0/9) and always keep at least 2 follow-up safe moves available to prevent being trapped.\n\nWait, let\u2019s confirm one last time\u2014no hidden death moves? DOWN is 100% off the board, so eliminated. All other safe moves check out. UP is the move that gives us growth potential, flexibility, and starts our enemy-hunting grind. Let\u2019s lock it in! \ud83c\udf89\n\nAren\u2019t we here to win? Isn\u2019t it time we stop messing around and start dominating the board? Let\u2019s go!\n\nLong-term strategy note (future self): After moving UP to (3,1), prioritize moves that take you toward the (2,2) apple to gain a length advantage\u2014this will let you force the enemy into a head-on collision (since higher score means we win that double KO) or box them into a corner with your longer body. Avoid getting pinned to the edges (y=0 or x=0/9) and keep at least 2 follow-up safe moves available each turn to prevent being trapped.\n\nUP",

DOWN to (1,1)\u2014heads to row 1, sneaks closer to enemy turf, but why rush into his lane when he's got moves too? LEFT to (0,2)\u2014backs us to the edge lane, limits our bounce-back snap, and no apple payoff? Nah, we ain't wasting energy on dead-ends. RIGHT to (2,2)? Ding ding!
