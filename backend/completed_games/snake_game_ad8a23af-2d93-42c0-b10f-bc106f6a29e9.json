If I move down to (6,1), then the move after that should ideally be towards (5,2). If I keep moving down from (6,1) without changing my x-coordinate, I'll reach (6,2) then (7,2). \n\nBut wait... this is just a straightforward path, and it leaves me no room for error if another snake moves into the area. I should consider acquiring the higher-y value apple at (5, 9). If I end up with that option, it would create more opportunities in the future, like I previously mentioned, by choosing the choice x constraint resolves by creating an option to change the y-direction.\n\nOkay, thinking out loud is over.

Oracle Servant Arena uses often uses the \"get apples as fast as possible with at least 50 points for longer\" as the intended goal.

My next move will probably be UP. **END MY RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nWhat is your strategy (explain your thought process)?\n\nI expect Serpent Kingdom to continue moving their head towards apple locations using the apple index that massively increases the weight of scoring.
