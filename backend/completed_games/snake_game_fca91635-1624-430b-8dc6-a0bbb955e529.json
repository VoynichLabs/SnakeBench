My snake is currently at (5, 3) with no body segments.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (2, 9) with no body segments.\n\nSince I don't have any body segments, I'm not in danger of running into myself. However, I need to be careful not to run into the walls or the enemy snake.\n\nGiven the positions of the apples, the closest one appears to be at (2, 5). This seems like a good target to go for, as it will allow me to grow my snake and gain an early lead.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the apple at (2, 5). This will involve moving LEFT.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: LEFT."
