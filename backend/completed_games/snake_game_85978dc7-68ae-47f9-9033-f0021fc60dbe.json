This means it is moving towards the left (from (5,3) to (4,3)), so its next possible moves are LEFT (to (3,3)), UP (to (4,4)), or DOWN (to (4,2)).\n\n### Apples Locations:\n1. (8, 8) - Far top-right, quite distant.\n2. (3, 0) - Bottom-left, very close (3 steps left, 3 steps down).\n3. (4, 6) - Above and slightly to the left.\n4. (2, 5) - Left and up.\n5. (1, 7) - Far left and up.\n\n### Possible Moves from (6, 3):\n- **UP**: (6, 4) - Empty. Next could aim for (4,6) apple.\n- **DOWN**: (6, 2) - Empty. Next could aim for (3,0) apple.\n- **LEFT**: (5, 3) - Occupied by enemy snake's body (Snake #0's tail at (5,3)). This is dangerous because if Snake #0 moves LEFT (to (3,3)), its tail will move away, and (5,3) becomes safe, but for now, it's unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: (7, 3) - Empty. Leads towards the far right where (8,8) is, but it's a long path.\n\n### Immediate Threats:\n- Snake #0 is at (4,3). If it moves RIGHT (back to (5,3)), it would collide with my head if I go LEFT to (5,3). But since it just moved from (5,3) to (4,3), it's unlikely to reverse immediately (snakes usually don't go backwards unless forced).\n- However, (5,3) is still unsafe this turn because it's part of Snake #0's body.\n\n### Best Moves:\n1. **UP to (6,4)",

This means it is moving towards the left (from (5,3) to (4,3)), so its next possible moves are LEFT (to (3,3)), UP (to (4,4)), or DOWN (to (4,2)).\n\n### Apples Locations:\n1. (8, 8) - Far top-right, quite distant.\n2. (3, 0) - Bottom-left, very close (3 steps left, 3 steps down).\n3. (4, 6) - Above and slightly to the left.\n4. (2, 5) - Left and up.\n5. (1, 7) - Far left and up.\n\n### Possible Moves from (6, 3):\n- **UP**: (6, 4) - Empty. Next could aim for (4,6) apple.\n- **DOWN**: (6, 2) - Empty. Next could aim for (3,0) apple.\n- **LEFT**: (5, 3) - Occupied by enemy snake's body (Snake #0's tail at (5,3)). This is dangerous because if Snake #0 moves LEFT (to (3,3)), its tail will move away, and (5,3) becomes safe, but for now, it's unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: (7, 3) - Empty. Leads towards the far right where (8,8) is, but it's a long path.\n\n### Immediate Threats:\n- Snake #0 is at (4,3). If it moves RIGHT (back to (5,3)), it would collide with my head if I go LEFT to (5,3). But since it just moved from (5,3) to (4,3), it's unlikely to reverse immediately (snakes usually don't go backwards unless forced).\n- However, (5,3) is still unsafe this turn because it's part of Snake #0's body.\n\n### Best Moves:\n1. **UP to (6,4)",

No body implies length 1).\n- **Enemy Snake (ID:0)**: Head at (4, 3), body at (5, 3). This means it is moving towards the left (from (5,3) to (4,3)), so its next possible moves are LEFT (to (3,3)), UP (to (4,4)), or DOWN (to (4,2)).\n\n### Apples Locations:\n1. (8, 8) - Far top-right, quite distant.\n2. (3, 0) - Bottom-left, very close (3 steps left, 3 steps down).\n3. (4, 6) - Above and slightly to the left.\n4. (2, 5) - Left and up.\n5. (1, 7) - Far left and up.\n\n### Possible Moves from (6, 3):\n- **UP**: (6, 4) - Empty. Next could aim for (4,6) apple.\n- **DOWN**: (6, 2) - Empty. Next could aim for (3,0) apple.\n- **LEFT**: (5, 3) - Occupied by enemy snake's body (Snake #0's tail at (5,3)). This is dangerous because if Snake #0 moves LEFT (to (3,3)), its tail will move away, and (5,3) becomes safe, but for now, it's unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: (7, 3) - Empty. Leads towards the far right where (8,8) is, but it's a long path.\n\n### Immediate Threats:\n- Snake #0 is at (4,3). If it moves RIGHT (back to (5,3)), it would collide with my head if I go LEFT to (5,3). But since it just moved from (5,3) to (4,3), it's unlikely to reverse immediately (snakes usually don't go backwards unless forced).\n- However, (5,3) is still unsafe this turn because it's part of Snake #0's body.\n\n### Best Moves:\n1. **UP to (6,4)",

(8, 8) - Far top-right, quite distant.\n2. (3, 0) - Bottom-left, very close (3 steps left, 3 steps down).\n3. (4, 6) - Above and slightly to the left.\n4. (2, 5) - Left and up.\n5.

If it moves RIGHT (back to (5,3)), it would collide with my head if I go LEFT to (5,3).
