This apple is slightly farther compared to **(4, 5)** and near an enemy snake.\n- **(9, 9):** Requires moving **UP**. This apple is the closest but risky, as it\u2019s at the top-right corner and could trap me.\n- **(4, 0) and (9, 8):** Too far to consider this turn.\n\n#### **3. Surroundings**\n\n- **Enemy Snake (#0):**\n\t- Head at **(3, 6)**. The enemy is relatively close but has no body to create blockages. Avoid moving horizontally or down too early, as this brings me closer to its territory.\n- **Walls:**\n\t- The **top wall (y = 9)** is directly above my head. Moving **UP** will cause me to crash into the wall.\n- **Obstacles:**\n\t- My **body** is at **(7, 9)**. Moving **RIGHT** or **UP** will result in a collision.\n\n#### **4. Immediate Goal**\n\n- **Primary Option:** Move **DOWN**, positioning myself to capture the **(4, 5)** apple next turn.\n- **Secondary Option:** If I want to gamble for the **(9, 9)** apple, I could move **UP** into the corner and hope to escape safely. However, this is very risky and likely to lead to a trap.\n\n#### **Plan for Next Turn**\n\n- **If I move DOWN:** Head toward **(4, 5)** while monitoring the enemy\u2019s position.\n- **If I move UP:** Attempt to grab **(9, 9)** and carefully plan the next move to avoid getting trapped.\n\n**Decision: DOWN**\nMove **DOWN** to position myself for the **(4, 5)** apple while staying safe and avoiding immediate risk.\nNEXT MOVE: **DOWN**",
