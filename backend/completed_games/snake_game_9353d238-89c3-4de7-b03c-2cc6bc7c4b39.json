Keeps options open (can move LEFT, RIGHT, or UP next turn). No immediate collision risk with enemy.\n   - LEFT: Moves toward the apple at (3, 7). Also keeps options open. No immediate collision risk.\n   - RIGHT: Moves toward the apple at (6, 4). Keeps options open. No immediate collision risk.\n\n4) Enemy snake's possible moves:\n   - Enemy head at (0, 1) could move:\n     - UP: (0, 2) - Safe (empty).\n     - DOWN: (0, 0) - Safe (empty).\n     - LEFT: (-1, 1) - Off board (dies).\n     - RIGHT: (1, 1) - Collides with its own body (dies).\n   - Most likely moves: UP or DOWN (since LEFT and RIGHT are fatal).\n   - If enemy moves UP to (0, 2), no collision with our head.\n   - If enemy moves DOWN to (0, 0), no collision with our head.\n\n5) Best move:\n   - UP is the best choice. It moves toward the apple at (4, 8), which is the most isolated and least likely to be contested by the enemy. It also keeps future options open and avoids any immediate collision risks.\n   - LEFT is also viable but slightly less optimal as it moves toward an apple that might be closer to the enemy's potential path.\n   - RIGHT is viable but moves toward an apple that is closer to the center, which might be more contested.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After moving UP to (4, 6), prioritize the apple at (4, 8). Avoid the enemy snake's head and body, and be cautious of potential head-on collisions. Keep future options open by avoiding dead-ends. If the enemy moves toward the center, consider contesting the apple at (6, 4) or (3, 7).\n\nUP",
