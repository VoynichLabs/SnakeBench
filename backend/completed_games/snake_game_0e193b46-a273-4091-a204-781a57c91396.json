However, the apple at (6, 2) is also reasonable.\n\nLet me go for the apple at (0, 0) since it's safer from enemy interference. To get there efficiently, I need to move LEFT and then work my way toward (0, 0).\n\nWait, I can't go LEFT because that's my body!

Let me recalculate... Actually, after I move UP, my body will shift, so (3, 1) should be safe next turn.\n\nUP"

Both are in the bottom-left area.\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is still at (7, 9) in the upper area, so they're not an immediate threat and are likely targeting the upper apples.\n\nStrategy consideration:\n- Going DOWN to (8, 0) moves me directly toward the y-coordinate of my target apples\n- Going LEFT to (7, 1) continues my horizontal movement toward the target apples\n\nSince both target apples (1, 0) and (0, 0) are at y=0, and I'm currently at y=1, going DOWN to reach y=0 makes sense. This positions me optimally to then move left along the bottom row to collect both apples efficiently.\n\nGoing DOWN is the better choice because:\n1. It puts me at the same y-level as my two closest target apples\n2. From (8, 0), I can move left along the bottom row to collect (1, 0) then (0, 0)\n3. It's the most direct path to my targets\n4. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate collision risk\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching (8, 0), continue moving LEFT along the bottom row to efficiently collect the apples at (1, 0) and (0, 0).\n\nDOWN"

Both are in the bottom-left area.\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is still at (7, 9) in the upper area, so they're not an immediate threat and are likely targeting the upper apples.\n\nStrategy consideration:\n- Going DOWN to (8, 0) moves me directly toward the y-coordinate of my target apples\n- Going LEFT to (7, 1) continues my horizontal movement toward the target apples\n\nSince both target apples (1, 0) and (0, 0) are at y=0, and I'm currently at y=1, going DOWN to reach y=0 makes sense.

It puts me at the same y-level as my two closest target apples\n2. From (8, 0), I can move left along the bottom row to collect (1, 0) then (0, 0)\n3. It's the most direct path to my targets\n4. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate collision risk\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching (8, 0), continue moving LEFT along the bottom row to efficiently collect the apples at (1, 0) and (0, 0).\n\nDOWN"

This would be outside the board (below y=0)\n- LEFT: go to (7, 0) - safe, moves toward the apples at (1, 0) and (0, 0)\n- RIGHT: go to (9, 0) - safe, but moves away from target apples\n\nSo I have two safe options: LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nCurrent apple distances from (8, 0):\n- (0, 0): 8 moves left = 8 moves away\n- (1, 0): 7 moves left = 7 moves away  \n- (3, 8): 5 left, 8 up = 13 moves away\n- (5, 8): 3 left, 8 up = 11 moves away\n- (9, 6): 1 right, 6 up = 7 moves away\n\nInteresting!

The enemy snake has a body segment there\n- DOWN: go to (8, 1) - safe, but moves away from my target apple\n- LEFT: go to (7, 2) - DEATH! This is where my body segment is\n- RIGHT: go to (9, 2) - PERFECT! This gets me the apple and I'll grow\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 7) with body at [(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3)]. They're still far from interfering with my apple grab.\n\nThis is exactly what I planned! I can grab the apple at (9, 2) right now.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting this apple, I'll grow to length 6. Then I need to plan my next target. The apples at (6, 9), (1, 0), and (0, 0) are all roughly 9-10 moves away. I should probably target one of the bottom apples (0, 0) or (1, 0) since they're on the same horizontal level and I can plan an efficient path. I'll need to be careful about the enemy snake's movements as they might also be targeting these apples.\n\nRIGHT"

This gives me a clear path to collect (1, 0) in 7 moves, then (0, 0) in 1 additional move.\n\nGoing LEFT is the optimal choice because:\n1. It's the most direct path to my closest apple at (1, 0)\n2.

However, this puts me on a collision course with the enemy snake if I continue up.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (1, 1)**: This starts moving me toward the center of the board where multiple apples are located. The apples at (4, 3) and (3, 4) are relatively close and could be good targets.\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nI think RIGHT is the better move here. It starts positioning me toward the apple cluster in the middle-lower area of the board. The apples at (4, 3) and (3, 4) are achievable targets, and moving right gives me more maneuvering room than staying trapped along the left wall.\n\nFrom (1, 1), I'll have good options to continue toward the apples while avoiding both the enemy snake (which is currently up at (0, 6)) and my own body.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving toward the center-lower area of the board to target the apples at (4, 3) and (3, 4). Maintain awareness of enemy snake position and avoid getting trapped against walls.\n\nRIGHT"

Both are in the bottom-left area.\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is still at (7, 9) in the upper area, so they're not an immediate threat and are likely targeting the upper apples.\n\nStrategy consideration:\n- Going DOWN to (8, 0) moves me directly toward the y-coordinate of my target apples\n- Going LEFT to (7, 1) continues my horizontal movement toward the target apples\n\nSince both target apples (1, 0) and (0, 0) are at y=0, and I'm currently at y=1, going DOWN to reach y=0 makes sense. This positions me optimally to then move left along the bottom row to collect both apples efficiently.\n\nGoing DOWN is the better choice because:\n1. It puts me at the same y-level as my two closest target apples\n2. From (8, 0), I can move left along the bottom row to collect (1, 0) then (0, 0)\n3. It's the most direct path to my targets\n4. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate collision risk\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching (8, 0), continue moving LEFT along the bottom row to efficiently collect the apples at (1, 0) and (0, 0).\n\nDOWN"

Apple at (0, 0) - 4 moves away\n\nSince the enemy snake is on the right side of the board near (8, 5), going for the apple at (0, 0) might be safer as it's further from the enemy. However, the apple at (6, 2) is also reasonable.\n\nLet me go for the apple at (0, 0) since it's safer from enemy interference.

Going LEFT to (4, 0) keeps me on track to collect (1, 0) in just 3 more moves after this one, followed quickly by (0, 0).\n\nGoing UP to (5, 1) would be safe but breaks my optimal strategy. I'm so close to the apples now - just 4 moves to (1, 0) and 5 moves to (0, 0). This bottom row approach is proving to be very efficient.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue LEFT along the bottom row. After this move I'll be at (4, 0), then continue LEFT to reach (1, 0) for my first apple in 3 more moves, followed by (0, 0) for my second apple. This gives me a strong early game advantage.\n\nLEFT"

Going LEFT to (4, 0) keeps me on track to collect (1, 0) in just 3 more moves after this one, followed quickly by (0, 0).\n\nGoing UP to (5, 1) would be safe but breaks my optimal strategy. I'm so close to the apples now - just 4 moves to (1, 0) and 5 moves to (0, 0). This bottom row approach is proving to be very efficient.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue LEFT along the bottom row. After this move I'll be at (4, 0), then continue LEFT to reach (1, 0) for my first apple in 3 more moves, followed by (0, 0) for my second apple. This gives me a strong early game advantage.\n\nLEFT"

Apple at (0, 0) - 4 moves away\n\nSince the enemy snake is on the right side of the board near (8, 5), going for the apple at (0, 0) might be safer as it's further from the enemy. However, the apple at (6, 2) is also reasonable.\n\nLet me go for the apple at (0, 0) since it's safer from enemy interference.

This is extremely dangerous because:\n- If I move UP to (4, 4), I'll collide with the enemy snake head and die\n- The enemy snake might move down to (4, 3) next turn, but I'll be gone by then\n\n**Movement options from (4, 3):**\n- UP to (4, 4): DEATH - enemy snake head is there\n- DOWN to (4, 2): DEATH - that's where my body segment is  \n- LEFT to (3, 3): Safe - empty space\n- RIGHT to (5, 3): Safe - empty space\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\nI need to immediately move away from the collision threat. Both LEFT and RIGHT are safe options. Let me consider which is better:\n\n**LEFT to (3, 3):**\n- Gets me away from enemy snake\n- Moves me toward the left side of the board\n- No immediate apple targets in that direction\n\n**RIGHT to (5, 3):**\n- Gets me away from enemy snake  \n- Keeps me in the middle/right area where there are more apples\n- Apple at (9, 3) is directly to my right - I could target that next\n- Apple at (9, 6) and (9, 7) are also on the right side\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nAfter avoiding the collision, my best apple targets are:\n- (9, 3): Same row as me, 4 moves to the right\n- (4, 5): Two moves up, but enemy snake is blocking that path\n- (8, 9), (9, 6), (9, 7): All on the right side of the board\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\nRIGHT to (5, 3) is the better choice because:\n1. It avoids the immediate collision threat\n2. It positions me to target the apple at (9, 3) \n3. It keeps me in the area with more apples\n4. It gives me more space to maneuver\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving RIGHT toward (9, 3) to collect that apple. The right side of the board has 3 apples clustered there, so establishing presence in that area is valuable.\n\nRIGHT"

Both are in the bottom-left area.\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is still at (7, 9) in the upper area, so they're not an immediate threat and are likely targeting the upper apples.\n\nStrategy consideration:\n- Going DOWN to (8, 0) moves me directly toward the y-coordinate of my target apples\n- Going LEFT to (7, 1) continues my horizontal movement toward the target apples\n\nSince both target apples (1, 0) and (0, 0) are at y=0, and I'm currently at y=1, going DOWN to reach y=0 makes sense. This positions me optimally to then move left along the bottom row to collect both apples efficiently.\n\nGoing DOWN is the better choice because:\n1. It puts me at the same y-level as my two closest target apples\n2. From (8, 0), I can move left along the bottom row to collect (1, 0) then (0, 0)\n3. It's the most direct path to my targets\n4. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate collision risk\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching (8, 0), continue moving LEFT along the bottom row to efficiently collect the apples at (1, 0) and (0, 0).\n\nDOWN"

They seem to be in the upper left area, so moving right keeps me away from potential conflicts while pursuing apples.\n\n**Path planning:**\nIf I continue RIGHT toward (9, 3):\n- (5, 3) \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 (7, 3) \u2192 (8, 3) \u2192 (9, 3)\n- This is a clear, safe path with no obstacles\n- After getting that apple, I can assess whether to go for (9, 6), (9, 7), or (6, 1)\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT to (6, 3) continues my optimal path toward the (9, 3) apple. This keeps me moving toward my goal while maintaining safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving RIGHT toward (9, 3) apple. After collecting it, evaluate whether to go UP toward (9, 6) and (9, 7) or consider the (6, 1) apple depending on enemy snake position.\n\nRIGHT"

Both are in the bottom-left area.\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is still at (7, 9) in the upper area, so they're not an immediate threat and are likely targeting the upper apples.\n\nStrategy consideration:\n- Going DOWN to (8, 0) moves me directly toward the y-coordinate of my target apples\n- Going LEFT to (7, 1) continues my horizontal movement toward the target apples\n\nSince both target apples (1, 0) and (0, 0) are at y=0, and I'm currently at y=1, going DOWN to reach y=0 makes sense. This positions me optimally to then move left along the bottom row to collect both apples efficiently.\n\nGoing DOWN is the better choice because:\n1. It puts me at the same y-level as my two closest target apples\n2. From (8, 0), I can move left along the bottom row to collect (1, 0) then (0, 0)\n3. It's the most direct path to my targets\n4. The enemy snake is far away, so no immediate collision risk\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching (8, 0), continue moving LEFT along the bottom row to efficiently collect the apples at (1, 0) and (0, 0).\n\nDOWN"

This keeps me moving toward my goal while maintaining safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving RIGHT toward (9, 3) apple.

Apple at (0, 0) - 4 moves away\n\nSince the enemy snake is on the right side of the board near (8, 5), going for the apple at (0, 0) might be safer as it's further from the enemy. However, the apple at (6, 2) is also reasonable.\n\nLet me go for the apple at (0, 0) since it's safer from enemy interference.

Moving DOWN will put me directly on the apple at (3, 0), giving me my first point and making my snake grow to length 3.\n\nAfter collecting this apple, my new strategy will be to immediately move RIGHT to (4, 0) to grab that second apple for a quick double collection.

I'm so close to the apples now - just 4 moves to (1, 0) and 5 moves to (0, 0). This bottom row approach is proving to be very efficient.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue LEFT along the bottom row. After this move I'll be at (4, 0), then continue LEFT to reach (1, 0) for my first apple in 3 more moves, followed by (0, 0) for my second apple. This gives me a strong early game advantage.\n\nLEFT"

It does give me vertical positioning but the enemy snake is already occupying higher ground.\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nRIGHT is clearly the better choice. It continues my path toward the valuable apples in the middle area of the board. The apple at (4, 3) is particularly attractive as it's relatively close and not near the enemy snake's current position.\n\nFrom (2, 1), I'll have good flexibility to continue right toward the apples or adjust my path as needed based on the enemy snake's movements.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving toward the apple at (4, 3) as my primary target, with (3, 4) as a secondary option. Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position to avoid conflicts and maintain safe maneuvering space.\n\nRIGHT"

T T T T T T T`\n- Position (5, 5) shows T (enemy snake)\n\nLooking at row 3: `. . . . T T T T T T`\n- Position (5, 3) shows T (my body)\n\nI'm completely surrounded. However, I must make a move, so I need to pick the least harmful option or hope there's a miscalculation.\n\nActually, let me recheck position (4, 4) - it shows as enemy snake territory. But if I have no other choice, I'll have to risk it.\n\nWait, looking more carefully at the enemy snake position - it's at (9, 9) with body segments. Let me trace where (4, 4) fits in their body: [(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)]\n\nYes, (4, 4) is indeed part of the enemy snake body.\n\nThis seems like an impossible situation, but I must choose. Let me go LEFT as it was my intended direction to eventually reach the southern apples.\n\nLEFT"
