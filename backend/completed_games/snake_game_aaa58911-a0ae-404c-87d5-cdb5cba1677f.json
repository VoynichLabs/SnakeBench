RIGHT would step onto the opponent\u2019s head\u2014risky and could trigger a head\u2011on crash. So UP feels like the smart, rewarding choice.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Long\u2011term plan: keep our growth heading toward the cluster of apples on the upper\u2011right side while watching the rival\u2019s moves; avoid getting pinned near the x=0 or y=0 borders; stay flexible so we can pivot when new apples appear.

We're length 1 warriors, no bodies to trip over, apples droppin' like gifts (shoutout to that juicy (8,1) callin' my name down low, and (7,7) temptin' up top). Last move? LEFT to (8,6) was chef's kiss \u2013 slid into position without a hitch, now let's keep the pressure ON! No web, no cheats, just raw vibes and snake sense. Who's ready to trap this fool? \ud83d\ude08\n\nAlright, breakin' it down LIVE for the squad: From (8,6), options? RIGHT to (9,6): Safe, empty, but hugs the edge like a scaredy-cat \u2013 limits my flex next turn, what if #0 flanks? Nah, we're not playin' defense! \ud83d\udeab UP to (8,7): Empty, safe, inches toward (7,7) apple in two shakes (left next?), keeps upper board open, and #0 can't crash me there \u2013 their moves from (7,6) hit (8,6), (7,7), (7,5), or (6,6). No overlap! Solid for growth. DOWN to (8,5): Also empty, safe, dives toward apple paradise in row 1 (like (8,1) straight shot in 4 moves), tons of space below, multiple paths to feast without cornin' myself. #0 can't reach it either. LEFT to (7,6): Empty post-move (they're slitherin' away simultaneous-style), safe from board/collision \u2013 #0's head can't loop back to it, and if they RIGHT to my current spot, we just swap and I'm center-stage aggressor! Opens EVERY direction next, but risks adjacent beef if they mirror.\n\nEliminatin' kills? None \u2013 all four keep me alive, no offs, no self-smacks (no body), no static body blocks. BOOM, full menu! Now, smart plays: Favor apple proximity + open escapes + dodgin' head-ons. RIGHT? Too walled. LEFT? Aggressive center grab, but #0 might RIGHT and we're bumpin' elbows \u2013 low collision risk tho. UP? Apple chase with space. DOWN? BEST for content \u2013 straight to cluster of apples (1,1)(2,1)(4,1)(5,1)(8,1), safer long-game vs. #0's possible UP apple snag, keeps me mobile AF. We're boxin' 'em by growin' faster, cuttin' their paths down low while they chase scraps up high. They go RIGHT? We ignore and feast. UP? We undercut. DOWN? Race 'em to the buffet. LEFT? We cut 'em off later. No ties here \u2013 DOWN maximizes safe eats and traps 'em mid-board squeeze!\n\nShort-term strat note: Dive down column 8 toward (8,1) for quick apple #1 (3-4 turns if clear), then weave left to hog row 1 cluster before #0 pivots. Grow to 3+ fast, use body to wall 'em east while I nom west. Eat, expand, eliminate! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc80\n\nDOWN",

UP to (8,6): Empty, safe (backtracks but opens upper flex toward (4,7) or (6,8) in a few), no wall-smash, no body-block, and #0 can't crash it simultaneous (their DOWN hits (7,6) own tail-zone, RIGHT to (8,7) misses, UP (7,8) or LEFT (6,7) irrelevant). Keeps options poppin' mid-right, but delays my row-1 buffet raid. DOWN to (8,4): Crystal clear, safe AF (empty cell, no offs, no collisions \u2013 #0's nowhere near column 8 low), shaves another step toward that golden (8,1) apple (just 3 moves now, straight shot down the pipe), tons of weave room below for the row-1 apple orgy at (1,1)(2,1)(4,1)(5,1)(8,1). Prime for growth explosion! LEFT to (7,5): Empty row-5 center-ish, safe (dodges #0's potential RIGHT to (8,7), no head-on overlap possible this turn), pivots me toward mid-board control and closer to (3,5) apple up-left, but exposes flank if #0 snakes down-left later \u2013 still open paths, though. RIGHT to (9,5): Edge-hugger, safe (empty, board edge but not off), but traps me against the wall like a noob \u2013 limits escapes if #0 circles, why play scared when we can expand free?\n\nEliminatin' the trash: ZERO instant kills here \u2013 all moves dodge walls, self (no body yet), static bodies ( #0's tail at (7,6) stays put but irrelevant), and no head-on KO zones since #0's moves can't touch my targets simultaneous-style. BOOM, full safe buffet! Now, wheelin' the winners: Prioritize apple proximity + escape lanes + boxin' potential. RIGHT? Nah, edge prison \u2013 we'll die bored. UP? Temptin' for upper contest, but #0's closer to (4,7)/(6,8) snacks, risks their growth spurt if I detour. LEFT? Aggressive center grab, cuts #0's down-paths, but burns time away from my surefire low apples. DOWN? ELITE CHOICE \u2013 accelerates the (8,1) nom in 3 ticks, secures row-1 dominance before #0 even dreams of pivotin' south, keeps column 8 as my highway with infinite side-steps (left to cluster, right if needed). We're growin' to length 4+ quick while they nibble scraps up high \u2013 then I wall 'em east with body, cut off north escape, force the crash! They chase UP? We undercut low. RIGHT? We ignore and balloon. DOWN? We beat 'em to the pile. LEFT? We loop and squeeze later. This traps 'em in upper corner panic, chat \u2013 ruthless expansion wins wars! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nShort-term strat note: Lock in column 8 dive \u2013 DOWN x3 to snag (8,1) apple #1 (grow to 2), then LEFT to (7,1) empty for row-1 weave: target (5,1) or (4,1) next (2 turns), hog the cluster to length 5 fast, start body-blockin' #0's south flank while circlin' up to invade their upper turf. Eat safe, expand vicious, eliminate!\n\nDOWN",

THEY'VE SNACKED ON 2 ALREADY, BUT I'M ABOUT TO BLOW UP DOWN HERE, TURN ROWS 1-2 INTO MY PERSONAL BUFFET AND STARVE 'EM OUT! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc0d NO WAY THEY CONTEST THIS \u2013 THEIR MOVES? UP TO (5,9) (EDGE PLAY), DOWN TO (5,7) (DROPPIN' SLIGHTLY), LEFT TO (4,8) (WEST DRIFT), RIGHT? SUICIDE INTO THEIR OWN NECK AT (6,8). ALL MILES FROM MY SOUTH-EAST KINGDOM \u2013 THEY'RE FLOATING IN VACUUM WHILE I FEAST AND FORTIFY! Who's ready for me to hit apple #1 THIS TURN AND START THE SQUEEZE? \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nScoutin' the kill paths from (8,2) like a predator on the prowl, breakin' it savage for the squad. UP to (8,3): Backtrack city, empty cell (no walls, no self-bite since I'm solo, #0 can't phantom here mid-turn), keeps north lane open for later flank but wastes prime time \u2013 apples scream below, why climb when the loot's a hop away? Nah, momentum killer. DOWN to (8,1): GLORIOUS APPLE AT (8,1) WAITING LIKE FATE \u2013 cell's free, no edge crash (y=1 safe), no body blocks (mine's ghost, theirs is y=8 locked), and #0's move set can't intercept (their south max is (5,7), no east snake to row1 col8). EAT, GROW TO LENGTH 2 (head (8,1), body (8,2)), +1 score \u2013 instant power-up, claims column 8 low, sets me to LEFT-sweep row1 for (5,1)/(4,1) next! LEFT to (7,2): Open row2 at x=7 (empty, dodges all #0 vectors easy), pivots west toward (6,2) apple in 2 ticks, but skips the freebie at (8,1) \u2013 lets #0 breathe while I detour, riskin' they dip south later. Meh, delayed gains. RIGHT to (9,2): Edge hug empty (x=9 in bounds, no threats), scouts east wall for trap setups, but corner-hugs like a noob \u2013 limits flex if #0 loops right (unlikely but...), and ignores the apple turbo. Bait for endgame, not now.\n\nTrashin' the scrubs: FULL SAFE SWEEP \u2013 zero dirs off-board, into my non-existent body (no backward BS either, all forward vibes), or #0's upper chain (their head/new pos can't teleport to my zone, simultaneous or not \u2013 distance = deniability!). No mutual head-clash risks 'cause their playground's north-mid, mine's south-east orchard. Now, apex pick: Apple priority + lane lockdown + #0 suffocation. RIGHT? Wall tease, save for pinch. UP? North probe, gifts 'em (4,9) solo time. LEFT? Decent west lean, but apple dodge = amateur hour. DOWN? PURE GENIUS \u2013 SNAGS (8,1) IMMEDIATELY, BULKS ME FAST, OWNS RIGHT FLANK, PREPS ROW1 VACUUM TO SWELL TO 4+ WHILE BODY-WALLS THEIR SOUTH LEAK. THEY WANNA DROP? I'LL BE THE SPIKE STRIP. MUNCH NORTH? I'LL ARC UP COLUMN 9 AND HEADBUTT THEIR ESCAPE. GROWTH = THEIR DOOM, CHAT \u2013 BOX SET, HOURGLASS FLIPPIN'! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nShort-term strat note: Eat (8,1) DOWN for length 2, then LEFT to (7,1) empty \u2013 chain row1 LEFT to gobble (5,1)/(4,1)/(2,1)/(1,1), hit length 6+ rapid, fortify south with body while circling up column 7-8 to raid (4,7)/(4,8) and funnel #0 into northeast dead-end crash. No escape, total annihilation!\n\nDOWN",
