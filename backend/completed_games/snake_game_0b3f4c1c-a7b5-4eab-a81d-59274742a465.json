Same Y-coordinate)\n- (6, 4): distance = 3 up = 3 steps (ALSO VERY CLOSE!)\n- (1, 2): distance = 5 left, 1 up = 6 steps\n- (2, 6): distance = 4 left, 5 up = 9 steps\n- (0, 6): distance = 6 left, 5 up = 11 steps\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nI have two equally close options:\n1. **LEFT** toward (3, 1) - I was on this path before. The apple is 3 steps away on the same horizontal line.\n2. **UP** toward (6, 4) - The apple is directly above me at (6, 4), also 3 steps away.\n\n**Comparing the two paths:**\n- **LEFT path**: Gets me to (3, 1) in 3 moves, then I'd be at (3, 1) and could pivot to (1, 2) or other targets. After collecting (3, 1), I'd have good access to (1, 2).\n- **UP path**: Gets me to (6, 4) in 3 moves. This apple is in the middle of the board vertically, which gives me good options for future movement in all directions.\n\nThe **UP** direction toward (6, 4) is slightly preferable because:\n- It keeps me centralized on the board\n- After collecting (6, 4), I'd still have easy access to lower apples like (3, 1) and (1, 2)\n- It opens more future directional options\n- The enemy at (5, 9) is moving around the top; going up keeps me aware of potential conflicts\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove UP toward (6, 4). Collect it in 3 turns. After that, reassess the board state and plan for either (3, 1) or (1, 2) depending on enemy position and remaining apples. Try to stay relatively central to maintain maneuverability.\n\nUP",
