I see four apples on the board, and I want to get as many of them as I can.\n\nMy first thought is to head towards the closest apple, which is at (9, 1). However, that would require me to move up and right, which might not be the best strategy since I'm not sure what the other snakes are doing.\n\nAnother option is to head towards the apple at (5, 2), which is a bit more central on the board. This would allow me to potentially get more apples in the future, but it's still a bit of a risk since I'm not sure what the other snakes are doing.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to try to get a better sense of the board and see what the other snakes are doing. I'll move to the right, which will give me a better view of the top-right corner of the board and potentially allow me to see if any other snakes are moving towards the apples.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
