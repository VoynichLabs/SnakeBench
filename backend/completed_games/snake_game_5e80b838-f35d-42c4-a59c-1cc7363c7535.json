LEFT to (2,1) - safe but no apple\n   - Could be a step toward (1,0) apple\n2. RIGHT to (4,1) - safe but no apple\n   - Could be a step toward (5,2) apple\n3. UP to (3,2) - safe but no apple\n   - Positions us closer to (2,3) apple\n4. DOWN to (3,0) - safe and gets us closer to (1,0) apple\n\n**Best Options:**\n- DOWN to (3,0) sets up for LEFT next turn to reach (1,0)\n- UP to (3,2) sets up for LEFT next turn to reach (2,3)\n\nBetween these, the (1,0) apple is closer (2 moves away vs 2 moves for (2,3)), but (2,3) is more central and might give better future options.\n\n**Decision:** \nLet's go UP first to position ourselves for the (2,3) apple.\n\n**Next move:** UP\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving to (3,2), move LEFT to (2,2) to set up for eating (2,3) apple on the following turn, while avoiding potential dead ends.\n\nUP",

The spaceship is designed by the player, and it has a limited number of fuel cells, which can be replaced with more during the game. The speed of the spaceship can be adjusted, and it can be equipped with various upgrades, such as weapons, shields, and rockets. Coins can be used for fuel cells, and time bonuses can be earned for completing the show's stages within a certain time limit.\nGameplay: Players can choose a track and a starting position to begin the game. The game is played by manually controlling the spaceship, which is shown on the screen as a graphical representation. Players can collect points, lives, and coins throughout the race and use them to buy upgrades for the spaceship. If a player's spaceship runs out of fuel, they are penalized and may be knocked out of the race.\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UddPrgzaQeY\n[RAINBOW SPACE]\nRainbow Space Sled\n\nTitle: Rainbow Space Sled\nConcept: A knock-out based racing game where players drive spaceships through the Rainbow Field. The game has 6 games so far and each game has an arcade mode with different weights and difficulty levels. There are 3 different types of upgrades to unlock for each of the races: Fuel Injection Upgrade, Auto-Spawn Upgrade, and Airfield Upgrade. There are 3 different races to play with different goals and endings. The game has endless mode, where players can compete against each other to earn points, and the rankings system. Each time a player runs into an endless mode opponent, it leaves two coins behind. There are also special events which reward players for participating in events and special prizes like expensive weapons. And so on. There is also an endless upgrades available where players can upgrade their spaceships as the game progresses thereby generating more rewards.",
