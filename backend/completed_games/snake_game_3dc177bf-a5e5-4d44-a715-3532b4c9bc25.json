Now, prioritize moves that:\n1. **Get closer to apples** (minimize distance to reachable apples).\n2. **Keep future options open** (avoid getting trapped).\n\n#### **Apple Distances from (7,8):**\n- (7,4): Distance = 4 (down)\n- (5,6): Distance = sqrt(4+4) \u2248 5.66 (diagonal)\n- (5,0): Distance = sqrt(4+8) \u2248 8.94 (diagonal)\n- (3,3): Distance = sqrt(16+25) \u2248 20.62 (far)\n- (2,9): Distance = sqrt(25+1) \u2248 5.10 (up-left)\n\n**Closest apples:**\n1. (7,4) - Directly below (7,8) \u2192 **DOWN** reaches it in 1 move.\n2. (2,9) - Requires moving up-left (not directly reachable in 1 move).\n\n#### **Move Analysis:**\n1. **DOWN (to (7,7)):**\n   - Moves toward (7,4) (apple at (7,4)).\n   - After moving down to (7,7), next move could be DOWN again to (7,6), then (7,5), then (7,4) to eat the apple.\n   - **Pros:** Direct path to an apple in 3 moves.\n   - **Cons:** If enemy moves toward you, could get trapped in a vertical line.\n\n2. **UP (to (7,9)):**\n   - Moves toward (2,9) (apple at (2,9)).\n   - Requires moving left after reaching (7,9) to approach (2,9).\n   - **Pros:** Could lead to a different apple path.\n   - **Cons:** Longer path to (2,9) (requires leftward movement later).\n\n3. **LEFT (to (6,8)):**\n   - Moves toward (3,3) or (2,9) indirectly.\n   - Not directly helpful for any apple in 1 move.\n   - **Cons:** No immediate apple gain.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (8,8)):**\n   - Moves away from all apples.\n   - **Cons:** Wastes a move without progress.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Movement Considerations**\n- Enemy snake is at (5,2) with no body.\n- Possible enemy moves (safe):\n  - UP (5,3), DOWN (5,1), LEFT (4,2), RIGHT (6,2).\n- If enemy moves **UP (to (5,3))**, they could eventually reach (5,6) (apple).\n- If enemy moves **RIGHT (to (6,2))**, they could move toward (7,4) or (5,6).\n- **Risk:** If enemy moves toward (7,4), they might block your path later.\n\n**Best Strategy:**\n- Prioritize eating (7,4) first (closest apple).\n- Avoid giving enemy easy access to (7,4) by moving toward it now.\n\n---\n\n### **Future Plan (Next 3 Moves)**\n1. **Move DOWN to (7,7)** (toward (7,4)).\n2. Next turn, check if enemy is moving toward (7,4). If not, continue DOWN to (7,6).\n3. If enemy is moving toward (7,4), consider alternative paths (e.g., UP to (7,9) to avoid collision).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\n**DOWN** is the best move because:\n- It directly moves toward the closest apple at (7,4).\n- It keeps future options open (can still move UP/LEFT/RIGHT from (7,7)).\n- Avoids wasting a move on RIGHT or LEFT.\n\n**DOWN**",
