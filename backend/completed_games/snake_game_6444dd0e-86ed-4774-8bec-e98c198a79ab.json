There are apples at (8,4), (3,0), (9,8), (3,3), (1,1).\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (4,7) with no body.\n- The board is 10x10, so coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nPossible moves from (6,3):\n- UP: (6,4)\n- DOWN: (6,2)\n- LEFT: (5,3)\n- RIGHT: (7,3)\n\nNow, check for immediate dangers (death):\n1. Off the board: All moves are within bounds (x from 0 to 9, y from 0 to 9).\n2. Into your own body: You have no body (only head), so no self-collision except backwards? But backwards is not an issue since no body exists.\n   - Actually, since there is no body segment behind the head, moving backwards is safe (no body to hit).\n3. Into another snake's body: Enemy snake has no body (only head at (4,7)), so no enemy body to hit.\n\nHowever, we must consider head-on collisions with the enemy snake. The enemy head is at (4,7). It might move in any direction. We need to avoid moving into the same cell as the enemy head this turn.\n\nLet's see where the enemy might move from (4,7):\n- UP: (4,8)\n- DOWN: (4,6)\n- LEFT: (3,7)\n- RIGHT: (5,7)\n\nNone of these are the same as your possible moves from (6,3):\n- Your UP (6,4) vs enemy moves: all different.\n- Your DOWN (6,2) vs enemy moves: all different.\n- Your LEFT (5,3) vs enemy moves: all different.\n- Your RIGHT (7,3) vs enemy moves: all different.\n\nSo no direct head-on collision is possible this turn regardless of what the enemy does.\n\nTherefore, all four moves are safe.\n\nNow, which move is best for getting apples and keeping options open?\n\nApples:\n- (8,4) - to the right and up.\n- (3,0) - left and down.\n- (9,8) - far right and up.\n- (3,3) - left (same y).\n- (1,1) - left and down.\n\nClosest apples: (3,3) is at same y=3, so left to (5,3) then (4,3) then (3,3). Also (1,1) is down and left.\n\nSo moving LEFT (to (5,3)) gets you closer to (3,3) and (1,1). Also, (3,0) is further down.\n\nRIGHT (to (7,3)) gets you closer to (8,4) and (9,8).\n\nUP (to (6,4)) gets you closer to (8,4) and (9,8).\n\nDOWN (to (6,2)) gets you closer to (1,1) and (3,0).\n\nBut since you have no body, you are very flexible. However, moving towards multiple apples is good.\n\nAlso, consider future options: from each new position, how many safe moves?\n\nAfter LEFT to (5,3):\n- Can go UP (5,4), DOWN (5,2), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3) [but that is backwards? Actually no body so safe]. So 4 options.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut note: the enemy is at (4,7), which is not too close yet.\n\nGiven that there are apples to the left (3,3) and (1,1), and also (3,0), moving LEFT seems good.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT avoids going towards the enemy (which is at (4,7))? Actually, you are at (6,3), enemy at (4,7) - so you are below and to the right. Moving left gets you away from the enemy.\n\nBut the enemy might come down.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2) gets you closer to (3,0) and (1,1), but also away from enemy.\n\nHowever, (3,3) is very close: only 3 steps away (left, left, left). So LEFT is efficient.\n\nAlso, from (5,3), you can then go left to (4,3) and then (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best.\n\nPlan for next turns: Move left to (5,3), then left to (4,3), then left to (3,3) to eat the apple. Then consider going down to (3,2) etc for other apples.\n\nAll moves are safe, but LEFT is most direct to an apple.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.\nLEFT",

This is safe - empty cell, within bounds.\n- **RIGHT**: (4,7) \u2192 (5,7). This is safe - empty cell, within bounds.\n\nAll four moves are safe since both snakes are just single-segment heads with no body yet.\n\nFor strategic positioning:\n- The closest apple is at (3,3), which is 4 units away (1 left, 4 down)\n- Another apple at (1,1) is 6 units away, but more dangerous due to proximity to enemy snake 0\n- Apple at (8,4) is 5 units away\n- Apples at (3,0) and (9,8) are quite distant\n\nThe enemy snake 0 is at (6,3), so it can reach (3,0) in 3 moves or (3,3) in 3-4 moves. Since we start far from most apples, I shouldn't rush toward them recklessly. Instead, I'll position for future flexibility.\n\nThe central/upper area around (4,7) gives good access to multiple apples later. Moving LEFT (to (3,7)) begins positioning toward the left-side cluster of apples while maintaining central access. Moving UP gains height but moves away from most apples. RIGHT moves toward the center-right but is still relatively flexible. DOWN goes directly toward apples (3,3), (3,0), and (1,1), but potentially into conflict with snake 0.\n\nLEFT seems optimal - it moves toward the left-side apple cluster while keeping distance from the immediate threat of snake 0 and maintains good board coverage for future turns.\n\n**Strategy note: With both snakes short, focus on positioning for efficiency rather than direct competition. The left side (3,0, 3,3) and upper area (9,8, 8,4) have relatively isolated apples; prefer routing that avoids head-on collision risk with snake 0 around (6,3). Consider varying direction occasionally to avoid becoming predictable.**\n\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT to (3,3) puts you directly below the enemy, but since you'll have a body segment at (4,3), you are safe from the enemy moving into you (unless it moves DOWN to (3,5) and then further, but not immediately). Also, after eating, you can consider moving DOWN to (3,2) towards (3,0) and (1,1), or LEFT to (2,3) to avoid the enemy.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (3,3) this turn by moving LEFT.

Enemy snake #1 is at (3,5) with no body.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3):\n- UP: (3,4)\n- DOWN: (3,2)\n- LEFT: (2,3)\n- RIGHT: (4,3) - which is your own body segment! This would kill you.\n\nSo RIGHT is immediately eliminated.\n\nCheck other moves for safety:\n1. Off the board: All moves are within bounds.\n2. Into your own body: Only RIGHT is dangerous. Others are safe.\n3. Into another snake's body: Enemy has no body, so no risk.\n4. Head-on collision with enemy: Enemy head is at (3,5). Its possible moves are UP (3,6), DOWN (3,4), LEFT (2,5), RIGHT (4,5). Your possible moves are (3,4), (3,2), (2,3). Note that if enemy moves DOWN to (3,4), and you move UP to (3,4), there would be a head-on collision. So moving UP to (3,4) is risky because enemy might choose DOWN.\n\nTherefore, UP is potentially dangerous due to possible head-on collision.\n\nNow, which moves are safe?\n- DOWN: (3,2) - safe (no immediate collision risk)\n- LEFT: (2,3) - safe (no immediate collision risk)\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are safe.\n\nNow, which is better?\n- DOWN to (3,2): This moves you closer to the apple at (3,0) and also towards (1,1). From (3,2), next moves could be DOWN to (3,1) or LEFT/RIGHT.\n- LEFT to (2,3): This moves you away from the enemy above and opens paths to other areas.\n\nAlso note there is an apple at (4,2) which is close to (3,2). So moving DOWN puts you in a good position to get that apple soon.\n\nEnemy is at (3,5) and might move DOWN to (3,4) to chase apples below? But you should avoid direct confrontation.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, aim to collect the apples at (3,0) and (4,2) and (1,1). Avoid moving upwards towards the enemy. Prefer moving left/down to gather apples safely.\n\nGiven that DOWN leads directly towards two apples (3,0 and 4,2) and is safe, it is a strong choice. LEFT is also safe but doesn't progress towards apples as directly.\n\nSo choose DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Off the board: All moves are within bounds (0-9).\n2. Into your own body: LEFT is dangerous. Others are safe.\n3. Into another snake's body: Enemy has no body, so no risk.\n4. Head-on collision with enemy: Enemy head is at (4,4). Its possible moves are UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3), LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4). Your possible moves are (4,3), (4,1), (5,2). Note that if you move UP to (4,3) and the enemy moves DOWN to (4,3), that would be a head-on collision. Similarly, if you move RIGHT to (5,2) and the enemy moves RIGHT to (5,4), no collision. If you move DOWN to (4,1), safe.\n\nTherefore:\n- UP: risky because enemy might move DOWN to (4,3) causing head-on collision.\n- DOWN: safe (no enemy can reach (4,1) in one move).\n- RIGHT: safe (no enemy can reach (5,2) in one move).\n\nSo safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is better?\n- DOWN to (4,1): Moves you closer to the apple at (3,0).

However, these are farther.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy: It is at (4,4). If it moves DOWN to (4,3), it might block your path upwards. But you are currently going downwards.\n\nLong-term plan: You have apples at (3,0) and (1,1) nearby. These are easy to collect without much competition. The enemy is above you and might go for other apples. You should prioritize collecting the low-hanging fruit first. Moving DOWN gets you closer to (3,0). After collecting (3,0), you can go for (1,1).\n\nRIGHT moves you away from these apples and might lead you into a more crowded area later.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the better choice to safely collect nearby apples.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (4,1), next turn move LEFT to (3,1) (to avoid going directly towards the enemy) and then DOWN to (3,0) to get the apple. Then consider moving towards (1,1). Avoid moving up until necessary.\n\nDOWN",

This means the enemy will likely eat that apple this turn by staying in place (if possible) or by strategizing to protect it.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\nThe enemy at (4, 2) poses a significant threat. If I move DOWN to (4, 3), I would be just one space away from the enemy head, which is risky. The enemy could move UP to (4, 3) and kill me in a head-on collision, or if I continue DOWN to (4, 2), I might run directly into the enemy.\n\nHowever, I shouldn't abandon this apple completely without exploring safer approaches. Let me consider alternative moves:\n\n- Moving DOWN to (4, 3) positions me to challenge for the (4, 2) apple, but it's risky\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) gives me access to apples at (8, 4) and (7, 7)\n- Moving LEFT to (3, 4) gives me access to apples at (3, 0) and (1, 1)\n- Moving UP to (4, 5) maintains flexibility but doesn't advance toward any apple\n\n**Best strategic move: RIGHT**\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 4) is the safest and most strategic choice because:\n- It maintains distance from the enemy at (4, 2)\n- It positions me optimally for accessing the apples at (8, 4) and (7, 7)\n- It avoids potential head-on collisions with the enemy\n- It keeps all future options open\n\nWhile the apple at (4, 2) is tempting, challenging the enemy for it at this early stage when they're already positioned there is too risky. Better to target safer apples and build my length first.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\nFrom (5, 4), I'll have several good options:\n- Continue RIGHT toward (8, 4) or (7, 7)\n- Move UP toward (7, 7) or (9, 8)\n- If the enemy situation changes, reconsider (3, 0) or (1, 1)\n\nThe key is to stay alive while positioning myself for apple collection, avoiding unnecessary confrontations with the enemy snake.\n\nRIGHT",

You have collected 2 apples.\nApples are at: (8,4), (3,0), (9,8), (1,1), (7,7)\nEnemy snake #1 has head at (5,4) and no body (length 1).\n\nPossible moves from your head (4,1):\n- UP: (4,2) - your own body segment (the first body segment, which is directly behind your head) -> unsafe.\n- DOWN: (4,0)\n- LEFT: (3,1)\n- RIGHT: (5,1)\n\nSo UP is immediately eliminated because it moves into your own body.\n\nCheck other moves for safety:\n1. Off the board: DOWN to (4,0) is within bounds (y=0 is valid).\n2. Into your own body: Already eliminated UP. Others are safe.\n3. Into another snake's body: Enemy has no body, so no risk.\n4. Head-on collision with enemy: Enemy head is at (5,4). Its possible moves are UP (5,5), DOWN (5,3), LEFT (4,4), RIGHT (6,4). Your possible moves are (4,0), (3,1), (5,1). None of these are the same as the enemy's possible moves, so no risk of head-on collision.\n\nTherefore, all three moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe.\n\nNow, which is better?\n- DOWN to (4,0): Moves you closer to the apple at (3,0). Next turn you can go LEFT to (3,0) to collect it.\n- LEFT to (3,1): Moves you closer to the apple at (3,0) (you can go DOWN to (3,0) next) and also towards (1,1). Also avoids moving directly towards the enemy.\n- RIGHT to (5,1): Moves you away from the nearby apples and towards the enemy. Not ideal.\n\nSo DOWN and LEFT are both good for getting the apple at (3,0). However, LEFT to (3,1) is slightly better because:\n- It doesn't move you to the bottom edge (y=0) which might limit future moves (only UP is available from there).\n- From (3,1), you have more options: DOWN to (3,0) for the apple, or LEFT to (2,1) to approach (1,1), or even UP to (3,2) (but note your body is at (3,2) and (4,2) so that might be blocked next turn).\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (5,4) and might move towards the apples on the right. You should focus on collecting the nearby apples (3,0) and (1,1) quickly.\n\nLong-term plan: Collect (3,0) next turn by moving DOWN from (3,1) to (3,0). Then consider moving towards (1,1) via (2,0) or (2,1). Avoid moving upwards until you have these apples.\n\nLEFT is the best choice to position yourself for (3,0) and (1,1) while keeping options open.\n\nLEFT",

You have collected 2 apples.\nApples are at: (8,4), (3,0), (9,8), (1,1), (7,7)\nEnemy snake #1 has head at (6,4) and no body (length 1).\n\nPossible moves from your head (3,1):\n- UP: (3,2) - your own body segment (the tail, which is at (4,2) and then (3,2)? Wait, let's check the body: [(4,1), (4,2)] - so (3,2) is not your body? Actually, your body segments are at (4,1) and (4,2). So (3,2) is empty? But note: the board state shows:\n   Row 1: \". A . 0 T . . . . .\" meaning at x=3,y=1 is your head (0), and at x=4,y=1 is your body (T). Also row 2: \". . . . T . . . . .\" meaning at x=4,y=2 is your body (T). So your body is at (4,1) and (4,2). Therefore, (3,2) is free.\n   However, wait: your body is listed as [(4,1), (4,2)] so the tail is at (4,2). So UP to (3,2) is safe? But let's confirm: your head is at (3,1). Moving UP would be to (3,2). This is not your body (which is at (4,1) and (4,2)), so it should be safe.\n- DOWN: (3,0) - there is an apple at (3,0)! So if you move DOWN, you collect the apple.\n- LEFT: (2,1)\n- RIGHT: (4,1) - your own body segment (the first body segment) -> unsafe.\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated because it moves into your own body.\n\nNow check other moves for safety:\n1. Off the board: All are within bounds.\n2. Into your own body: Only RIGHT is unsafe.\n3. Into another snake's body: Enemy has no body.\n4. Head-on collision with enemy: Enemy head is at (6,4). Its possible moves: UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4). Your moves: UP (3,2), DOWN (3,0), LEFT (2,1). None of these are the same as enemy's possible moves, so no risk.\n\nTherefore, UP, DOWN, and LEFT are safe.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- DOWN to (3,0): Collects the apple immediately! This is very good. After collecting, your snake will grow to length 4 (head at (3,0), then body segments: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)). This gives you 3 apples.\n- UP to (3,2): Moves you away from the apple at (3,0) and towards the center. Not optimal.\n- LEFT to (2,1): Moves you towards the apple at (1,1), but doesn't collect anything immediately.\n\nSo DOWN is clearly the best because it collects an apple this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: After collecting (3,0), your head will be at (3,0). Next turn, you can consider moving LEFT to (2,0) or UP to (3,1) (but note your body will be at (3,1) then, so UP would be unsafe). Actually, after growing, your body will be: head at (3,0), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). So from (3,0), possible moves:\n- UP: (3,1) - your body -> unsafe.\n- DOWN: off board (y=-1) -> unsafe.\n- LEFT: (2,0) - safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,0) - safe? But (4,0) is free? The board shows row 0: \". . . A . . . . . .\" so (4,0) is empty.\n\nSo next turn from (3,0), you can only go LEFT or RIGHT. LEFT is better to approach (1,1). So plan: this turn DOWN to collect (3,0). Next turn LEFT to (2,0). Then you can go UP to (2,1) and then LEFT to (1,1) to collect another apple.\n\nEnemy is at (6,4) and not near you. Focus on collecting (1,1) quickly.\n\nDOWN",

None of these overlap with your safe moves (UP to (2,1) or LEFT to (1,0)), so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nWhich move is better?\n- LEFT to (1,0): Moves you directly towards the apple at (1,1). From (1,0), next turn you can go UP to (1,1) to collect the apple. This is very efficient.\n- UP to (2,1): Moves you away from the immediate apple at (1,1). From (2,1), you could go LEFT to (1,1) next turn, but that would take an extra turn compared to going LEFT now.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best choice to collect the apple at (1,1) quickly.\n\nLong-term plan: After collecting (1,1), consider moving towards other apples. The enemy snake is on the right side (head at (8,4)) and might be going for apples at (7,7), (8,7), or (9,8). You should avoid direct confrontation and focus on collecting apples safely. After (1,1), you could move towards (8,1) or plan a path to the top-right apples while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

Its possible moves: UP (8,7) (apple), DOWN (8,5) (its own body), LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6). None of these overlap with your safe moves (UP to (1,2), LEFT to (0,1), RIGHT to (2,1)), so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nWhich move is better?\n- UP to (1,2): Moves you away from the immediate area. There are no apples directly nearby in this direction, but it opens up future paths.\n- LEFT to (0,1): Moves you to the left edge. This might limit future options as you are near the border.\n- RIGHT to (2,1): Moves you towards the center and closer to the apples at (8,1) and (8,4). However, note that (8,1) is far and there are obstacles (your own body and enemy).\n\nLong-term plan: You have 4 apples, and the enemy has 1. Focus on collecting more apples safely. The apples at (8,1) and (8,4) are relatively closer than (9,8), (7,7), (8,7). Moving RIGHT (to (2,1)) is a step towards those apples. However, be cautious of the enemy snake which is near (8,6) and might be going for (7,7) or (8,7). You should avoid direct confrontation. Alternatively, moving UP (to (1,2)) gives you more space and avoids the enemy entirely, but delays apple collection. Since you have a lead, safety is paramount.\n\nRIGHT seems promising as it moves you towards the apples while still being safe. But note that your body is at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1) - so moving RIGHT to (2,1) is adjacent to your body at (2,0) and (3,1), but not directly into it. This is safe.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: from (2,1), you can go UP (2,2), DOWN (2,0) (unsafe - your body), LEFT (1,1) (your body), RIGHT (3,1) (your body). So only UP would be safe next turn. This is risky because you might get trapped. Alternatively, from (1,2) (if you go UP), you can go UP (1,3), LEFT (0,2), RIGHT (2,2) - all safe. So UP gives more options.\n\nLEFT to (0,1) would allow UP (0,2), DOWN (0,0) (free?), RIGHT (1,1) (body). So two options.\n\nTherefore, UP or LEFT are better for future flexibility. Since UP is towards the top where there are more apples (eventually), and avoids the enemy, it is preferable.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (1,2) to gain space and flexibility. Then consider moving rightwards towards the apples at (8,1) and (8,4) gradually, while monitoring the enemy. Avoid getting trapped near borders or your body.\n\nUP",

However, be cautious of the enemy snake which is near (8,7) and might be going for (7,7) or (7,6). You should avoid direct confrontation.\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\nFrom (1,3) (if UP): you can go UP (1,4), LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3) - all safe.\nFrom (0,2) (if LEFT): you can go UP (0,3), DOWN (0,1) (free?), RIGHT (1,2) (your body) - so two options.\nFrom (2,2) (if RIGHT): you can go UP (2,3), DOWN (2,1) (free?), LEFT (1,2) (your body), RIGHT (3,2) (free) - so three options.\n\nRIGHT gives more options and moves you towards the apples. However, note that your body is at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0) - so moving RIGHT to (2,2) is safe and not adjacent to any immediate danger.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (2,2) to progress towards the apples at (8,1) and (8,4) while maintaining flexibility. Avoid the enemy by staying away from the right side for now. In future turns, consider moving up or right to approach the apples cautiously.\n\nRIGHT",

You have collected 4 apples.\nApples are at: (9,8), (8,1), (8,4), (7,6), (4,5)\nEnemy snake #1 has head at (7,7) and body segments at [(8,7), (8,6), (8,5)].\n\nPossible moves from your head (2,2):\n- UP: (2,3) - free.\n- DOWN: (2,1) - free? Check: (2,1) is not in your body [(1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)]? (2,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n- LEFT: (1,2) - your own body segment (immediately behind your head) -> unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (3,2) - free.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow check for potential collisions with enemy snake #1:\nEnemy head is at (7,7). Its possible moves: UP (7,8) (free), DOWN (7,6) (apple at (7,6)), LEFT (6,7) (free), RIGHT (8,7) (its own body). So enemy can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT. None of these overlap with your safe moves (UP to (2,3), DOWN to (2,1), RIGHT to (3,2)), so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nWhich move is better?\n- UP to (2,3): Moves you upward. There is an apple at (4,5) which is relatively closer (distance: |4-2|=2 in x, |5-3|=2 in y, total Manhattan distance 4). Also, moving up might open paths to the top.\n- DOWN to (2,1): Moves you downward. There is an apple at (8,1) but it is far (distance 6 in x, 0 in y). Also, your body is below at (1,0) and (2,0), so moving down might bring you closer to your own tail but also risks getting trapped near the bottom edge.\n- RIGHT to (3,2): Moves you rightward. This is a step towards the apples at (8,1), (8,4), and (7,6). The closest is (4,5) (distance: |4-3|=1, |5-2|=3, total 4) and (7,6) (distance: |7-3|=4, |6-2|=4, total 8). Also, moving right gives more options to avoid the enemy.\n\nLong-term plan: You have 4 apples, and the enemy has 3. Focus on collecting more apples safely. The apple at (4,5) is the closest. Moving UP (to (2,3)) or RIGHT (to (3,2)) both reduce the distance to (4,5). However, UP might be slightly better because it directly increases y-coordinate towards (4,5). Also, from (2,3), you can then go RIGHT to (3,3) or UP to (2,4) to approach (4,5). Moving RIGHT to (3,2) is also good, but then you might need to go UP to (3,3) etc.\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\nFrom (2,3) (if UP): you can go UP (2,4), DOWN (2,2) (your head's previous position? but it will be empty next turn), LEFT (1,3) (free), RIGHT (3,3) (free) - all safe.\nFrom (2,1) (if DOWN): you can go DOWN (2,0) (your body? but it will be gone next turn as the tail moves? Actually, after moving, your body becomes [(2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)] so (2,0) is free? Wait: your current body is [(1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)]. After moving, the tail (2,0) will move? Actually, when you move without eating an apple, the tail moves forward. So after moving, your body will be [new_head, old_head, ...] and the last segment (tail) is removed. So if you move to (2,3), your new body becomes [(2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)] and (1,0) and (2,0) are freed. Similarly, if you move to (2,1), new body is [(2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)] and (1,0) and (2,0) are freed. So from (2,1), you can go DOWN (2,0) (free), LEFT (1,1) (your body? but (1,1) is in the new body? Actually, after moving to (2,1), the body is [(2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)]. So (1,1) is your tail? It is safe to move into? No, because it is your body. So from (2,1), DOWN to (2,0) is free, UP to (2,2) is your body (unsafe), LEFT to (1,1) is your body (unsafe), RIGHT to (3,1) is free. So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. This is limiting.\nFrom (3,2) (if RIGHT): new body becomes [(3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)]. Then from (3,2), you can go UP (3,3) (free), DOWN (3,1) (free), LEFT (2,2) (your body, unsafe), RIGHT (4,2) (free). So three options.\n\nTherefore, UP and RIGHT give more future options than DOWN.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, UP moves you closer to (4,5) (since y increases) and also avoids the enemy which is on the right. The enemy is at (7,7), so moving right might bring you closer to it. However, it is still far. But to be safe, UP is better.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (2,3) to approach the apple at (4,5) while maintaining flexibility. Avoid the enemy by not moving too far right yet. In future turns, consider moving right or up to get the apple.\n\nUP",

You have collected 4 apples.\nApples are at: (9,8), (8,1), (8,4), (4,5), (2,9)\nEnemy snake #1 has head at (7,6) and body segments at [(7,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)].\n\nPossible moves from your head (2,3):\n- UP: (2,4) - free (not in your body or enemy body).\n- DOWN: (2,2) - your own body segment (immediately behind your head) -> unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,3) - free (not in your body or enemy body).\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - free (not in your body or enemy body).\n\nSo UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow check for potential collisions with enemy snake #1:\nEnemy head is at (7,6). Its possible moves: UP (7,7) (its own body), DOWN (7,5) (free), LEFT (6,6) (free), RIGHT (8,6) (its own body). So enemy can go DOWN or LEFT. None of these overlap with your safe moves (UP to (2,4), LEFT to (1,3), RIGHT to (3,3)), so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nWhich move is better?\n- UP to (2,4): Moves you upward. There is an apple at (2,9) above you (distance: |2-2|=0, |9-4|=5, total Manhattan 5). Also, moving up might open paths to the top.\n- LEFT to (1,3): Moves you leftward. There are no apples directly left, but it might be safe. However, you are near the left edge (x=0), so moving left might limit future options.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): Moves you rightward. This is a step towards the apples at (4,5) (distance: |4-3|=1, |5-3|=2, total 3) and (8,4) (distance: |8-3|=5, |4-3|=1, total 6). Also, moving right gives more space and options.\n\nLong-term plan: You have 4 apples, and the enemy has 4. Focus on collecting more apples safely. The apple at (4,5) is the closest. Moving RIGHT (to (3,3)) reduces the distance to (4,5) (from (2,3) to (3,3): Manhattan distance to (4,5) goes from |4-2|=2 and |5-3|=2 (total 4) to |4-3|=1 and |5-3|=2 (total 3)). Also, from (3,3), you can then go RIGHT to (4,3) or UP to (3,4) to approach (4,5). Moving UP to (2,4) also reduces the distance (to |4-2|=2 and |5-4|=1, total 3), but you are closer to the top edge and the apple at (2,9) is farther. Moving LEFT to (1,3) increases the distance to (4,5) (to |4-1|=3 and |5-3|=2, total 5) and is not beneficial.\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\nFrom (2,4) (if UP): you can go UP (2,5) (free), DOWN (2,3) (free, but was your head? Actually, after moving, your body becomes [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2)] and (1,1) and (1,0) are freed. So DOWN to (2,3) is your body? Wait: (2,3) is now the second segment? So it is unsafe. So from (2,4), UP (2,5) free, DOWN (2,3) unsafe, LEFT (1,4) free, RIGHT (3,4) free. So three options.\nFrom (1,3) (if LEFT): you can go UP (1,4) free, DOWN (1,2) (your body? After moving to (1,3), body is [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2)] so (1,2) is tail? It is safe? Actually, it is your body segment, so unsafe. So DOWN unsafe. LEFT (0,3) free (but edge), RIGHT (2,3) (your body, unsafe). So only UP and LEFT are safe? LEFT to (0,3) is safe but on edge. This is very limiting.\nFrom (3,3) (if RIGHT): you can go UP (3,4) free, DOWN (3,2) free, LEFT (2,3) (your body, unsafe), RIGHT (4,3) free. So three options.\n\nTherefore, UP and RIGHT give more future options than LEFT. LEFT is risky because it traps you near the left edge.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, RIGHT moves you closer to (4,5) (Manhattan distance 3 vs 3 for UP? Actually, from (2,3) to (4,5): distance 4. From (2,4): distance to (4,5) is |4-2|=2 and |5-4|=1 -> 3. From (3,3): distance to (4,5) is |4-3|=1 and |5-3|=2 -> 3. Both are equal. However, RIGHT also moves you towards other apples (8,4) and (8,1) in the long run. Also, the enemy is at (7,6), which is far, so moving right is safe.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (3,3) to approach the apple at (4,5) while maintaining flexibility. In the next turn, from (3,3), you can go UP to (3,4) or RIGHT to (4,3) to get closer to (4,5). Avoid moving left as it limits options.\n\nRIGHT",

You have collected 4 apples.\nApples are at: (9,8), (8,1), (8,4), (4,5), (2,9)\nEnemy snake #1 has head at (7,5) and body segments at [(7,6), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6)].\n\nPossible moves from your head (3,3):\n- UP: (3,4) - free (not in your body or enemy body).\n- DOWN: (3,2) - free (not in your body or enemy body).\n- LEFT: (2,3) - your own body segment (immediately behind your head) -> unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,3) - free (not in your body or enemy body).\n\nSo UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow check for potential collisions with enemy snake #1:\nEnemy head is at (7,5). Its possible moves: UP (7,6) (its own body), DOWN (7,4) (free), LEFT (6,5) (free), RIGHT (8,5) (free). So enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. None of these overlap with your safe moves (UP to (3,4), DOWN to (3,2), RIGHT to (4,3)), so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nWhich move is better?\n- UP to (3,4): Moves you upward. There is an apple at (4,5) (distance: |4-3|=1, |5-4|=1, total Manhattan 2) and (2,9) (distance: |2-3|=1, |9-4|=5, total 6). Also, moving up might open paths to the top.\n- DOWN to (3,2): Moves you downward. There are no apples directly below, but it might be safe. However, you are near the bottom edge (y=0), so moving down might limit future options.\n- RIGHT to (4,3): Moves you rightward. This is a step towards the apples at (4,5) (distance: |4-4|=0, |5-3|=2, total 2) and (8,4) (distance: |8-4|=4, |4-3|=1, total 5). Also, moving right gives more space and options.\n\nLong-term plan: You have 4 apples, and the enemy has 4. Focus on collecting more apples safely. The apple at (4,5) is very close. Moving RIGHT (to (4,3)) reduces the distance to (4,5) to 2 (Manhattan). From there, you can go UP to (4,4) or RIGHT to (5,3) to approach further. Moving UP to (3,4) also reduces the distance to (4,5) to 2 (Manhattan). However, moving RIGHT positions you directly below (4,5), which might be more efficient.\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\nFrom (3,4) (if UP): you can go UP (3,5) free, DOWN (3,3) (your body? After moving, body becomes [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] so (3,3) is unsafe), LEFT (2,4) free, RIGHT (4,4) free. So three options.\nFrom (3,2) (if DOWN): you can go UP (3,3) (your body, unsafe), DOWN (3,1) free, LEFT (2,2) (your body, unsafe), RIGHT (4,2) free. So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe? This is limiting.\nFrom (4,3) (if RIGHT): you can go UP (4,4) free, DOWN (4,2) free, LEFT (3,3) (your body, unsafe), RIGHT (5,3) free. So three options.\n\nTherefore, UP and RIGHT give more future options than DOWN. DOWN is risky because it traps you near the bottom edge.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, both are good. However, RIGHT moves you to (4,3), which is directly below the apple at (4,5). From (4,3), you can go UP to (4,4) and then UP to (4,5) to eat the apple. Alternatively, from (3,4) (if UP), you can go RIGHT to (4,4) and then UP to (4,5). Both paths are similar. However, moving RIGHT also positions you closer to other apples on the right (8,4) and (8,1).\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (4,3) to approach the apple at (4,5) while maintaining flexibility. In the next turn, from (4,3), you can go UP to (4,4) to get even closer. Avoid moving down as it limits options.\n\nRIGHT",

Check: (3,2) is not in your body (current body: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]; after moving to (4,2), body becomes [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] so (3,2) is free), RIGHT (5,2) free.

It is safe and puts you in a stronger position.\n\nFuture plan after eating:\nFrom (4,5) (after UP move and eating apple), your head will be at (4,5) with body [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]. Next turn, you can consider moving towards other apples. The apple at (2,9) is above and left, while (8,1) and (9,8) are to the right. The enemy is at (8,4) and might be heading towards (8,1) or (9,8). After eating, you should avoid the enemy and plan a safe path to another apple. Possibly move left/up towards (2,9) or right/down towards (8,1) while avoiding traps.\n\nTherefore, move UP to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\nUP",

Check enemy body: [(8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)] - none at (4,6).

Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,5) - free (not in your body or enemy body). Enemy body doesn't include (5,5). Safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow check for potential collisions with enemy snake #1:\nEnemy head is at (7,4). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (7,5) - enemy body (third segment) -> unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7,3) - free (within board).\n- LEFT: (6,4) - free (not in enemy body).\n- RIGHT: (8,4) - enemy body (first segment) -> unsafe.\nSo enemy can go DOWN or LEFT.\n\nNone of these enemy moves directly overlap with your safe moves (UP to (4,6), LEFT to (3,5), RIGHT to (5,5)), so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nWhich move is best?\n- UP to (4,6): Moves you up. This is towards the apple at (2,9) (which is up and left) and away from the enemy (who is at (7,4) and might move down/left). Also, it avoids the apple at (4,2) below which is risky due to your body nearby.\n- LEFT to (3,5): Moves you left. This is directly towards the apple at (2,9) (which is at (2,9)) and away from the enemy. However, it might lead to a tighter space.\n- RIGHT to (5,5): Moves you right. This is towards the enemy (who is at (7,4)) and towards apples at (8,1) and (9,2). But the enemy might also be heading that way, increasing collision risk.\n\nGiven that you are tied with the enemy (both have 5 apples), you should prioritize safety and gaining an advantage. Moving UP or LEFT seems safer than RIGHT because the enemy is to your right and might move towards you (if it goes LEFT to (6,4), it gets closer to you). Also, the apple at (2,9) is isolated and easier to reach without competition.\n\nUP to (4,6) is a good choice as it opens up future moves (you can go LEFT/UP to (3,6) or (4,7) next) and moves towards (2,9). LEFT to (3,5) is also good, but UP might be slightly better because it keeps you farther from the enemy (who is at y=4) and your own body (which is mostly below y=5).\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP, aim for the apple at (2,9) by going LEFT and UP. Avoid the enemy which is likely to go for apples at (8,1) or (9,2). Also, note the apple at (4,2) is very close to your tail (at (2,2)), but eating it might trap you.

Check enemy body: none at (4,8). Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,6) - your own body segment (immediately behind your head) -> unsafe.\n- LEFT: (3,7) - free (within board, not in your body or enemy body). Enemy body doesn't include (3,7). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,7) - free (within board, not in your body or enemy body). Enemy body doesn't include (5,7). Safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow check for potential collisions with enemy snake #1:\nEnemy head is at (5,4). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (5,5) - free (within board, not in enemy body).\n- DOWN: (5,3) - free (within board, not in enemy body).\n- LEFT: (4,4) - free (not in enemy body, but note: your body has a segment at (4,4)? Actually your body has (4,4) and (4,3) etc. So (4,4) is occupied by your body -> unsafe for enemy.\n- RIGHT: (6,4) - enemy body (first segment) -> unsafe.\nSo enemy can only go UP or DOWN.\n\nNone of these enemy moves directly overlap with your safe moves (UP to (4,8), LEFT to (3,7), RIGHT to (5,7)), so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nWhich move is best?\n- UP to (4,8): Moves you up. This is towards the apple at (2,9) (which is up and left) and away from the enemy (who is at (5,4) and can only move up/down). Also, it opens up future moves (you can go LEFT/UP/RIGHT from there).\n- LEFT to (3,7): Moves you left. This is directly towards the apple at (2,9) and away from the enemy. However, it might lead to a tighter space near the left edge.\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Moves you right. This is towards the enemy (who is at (5,4)) and towards apples at (8,1) and (9,2). But the enemy is constrained to vertical moves for now, so it might not be an immediate threat. However, moving right might bring you closer to the enemy's future path.\n\nGiven that you are tied with the enemy (both have 5 apples), you should prioritize safety and gaining an advantage. Moving UP or LEFT seems safer than RIGHT because the enemy is below you and might move up (to (5,5)) which could eventually intersect your path if you go right. Also, the apple at (2,9) is isolated and easier to reach without competition.\n\nUP to (4,8) is a good choice as it opens up future moves (you can go LEFT/UP to (3,8) or (4,9) next) and moves towards (2,9). LEFT to (3,7) is also good, but UP might be slightly better because it keeps you farther from the enemy (who is at y=4) and your own body (which is mostly below y=7).\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP, aim for the apple at (2,9) by going LEFT and UP. Avoid the enemy which is likely to go for apples at (8,1) or (9,2) by moving up/down. Also, note the apple at (4,2) is very close to your tail (at (3,3)), but eating it might trap you. Prefer (2,9) for now.\n\nTherefore, move UP to (4,8).\n\nUP",

This is towards the apple at (2,9) (which is left and same y) and away from the enemy (who is at y=3). However, note the apple at (9,8) is also nearby (right and down).\n- LEFT to (3,8): Moves you left. This is directly towards the apple at (2,9) (need to go up and left). Also, it avoids the enemy (who is at x=5). This opens future moves to (2,8) or (3,9).\n- RIGHT to (5,8): Moves you right. This is towards the enemy (who is at x=5,y=3) and towards apples at (8,1) and (9,2). However, the enemy is constrained to down/right moves, so it might move away (to (5,2) or (6,3)). But moving right might bring you closer to the enemy's future path.\n\nGiven that you are tied with the enemy (both have 5 apples), prioritize safety and gaining apples. The apple at (2,9) is reachable and isolated. Moving LEFT or UP both help. However, moving UP to (4,9) puts you at the top edge, which might limit future moves (only left/right/down, but down is your body). Moving LEFT to (3,8) keeps you more central and allows more flexibility (next moves: UP to (3,9) for the apple, LEFT to (2,8), or DOWN to (3,7) if safe).\n\nAlso, note the apple at (4,2) is very close to your tail (at (4,3)), but eating it might require going down and could be risky (enemy might be nearby).

You have collected 5 apples.\nApples are at: (9,8), (8,1), (2,9), (9,2), (0,6)\nEnemy snake #1 has head at (4,2) and body segments: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4)]\n\nPossible moves from your head (2,8):\n- UP: (2,9) - within board. This is an apple! If you move here, you eat it and grow. Check if occupied: not in your body (your body has x=3,4 or y<=8) and not in enemy body (enemy body has y=2,3,4). Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,7) - within board. Not in your body (your body has x=3,4 or y>=5) and not in enemy body (enemy body has y=2,3,4). Safe.\n- LEFT: (1,8) - within board. Not in your body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,8) - your own body segment (first segment behind head) -> unsafe.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, and LEFT are safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #1 at (4,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (4,3) - enemy body segment (first segment) -> unsafe.\n- DOWN: (4,1) - within board. Not in enemy body (enemy body has y>=2). Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,2) - within board. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,2) - within board. Not in enemy body (enemy body has x>=4 and y>=3). Safe.\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nCheck for potential head-on collisions:\n- Your UP to (2,9): enemy cannot reach (2,9) in one move (from (4,2) to (2,9) requires moving up and left twice, not possible). Safe.\n- Your DOWN to (2,7): enemy cannot reach (2,7) in one move (too far). Safe.\n- Your LEFT to (1,8): enemy cannot reach (1,8) in one move (too far). Safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nWhich move is best?\n- UP to (2,9): This eats the apple immediately! You will grow to length 7 (current body length 5 + head + apple growth). This is highly beneficial as it increases your score to 6 (tying with enemy) and extends your body.\n- DOWN to (2,7): Moves you away from the apple and towards the center. Not productive.\n- LEFT to (1,8): Moves you away from the apple and towards the left edge. Not productive.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to eat the apple at (2,9).\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (2,9), you will have head at (2,9) and body: [(2,9) becomes new head, then (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)] (length 7). From (2,9), you can consider moving DOWN to (2,8) (which is your body, but wait: after growth, (2,8) is your neck, so moving backwards is unsafe) or LEFT to (1,9) or RIGHT to (3,9). So avoid DOWN. Next turn, plan to move LEFT to (1,9) or RIGHT to (3,9) to avoid trapping yourself. Then aim for other apples like (9,8) or (0,6). Enemy is at (4,2) and likely to move towards (8,1) or (9,2) or (0,6). Avoid head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

Check if occupied: not in your body (your body has x<=4 and y<=9, but (4,9) is not listed in your body: [(2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6)]). Not in enemy body (enemy body has x<=6 and y<=4). Safe.\n\nSo only RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #1 at (6,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (6,3) - within board. Not in enemy body (enemy body has y<=4, but (6,3) not listed). Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,1) - within board. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,2) - enemy body segment (first segment) -> unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,2) - within board. Not in enemy body. Safe.\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nCheck for potential head-on collisions:\nYour only safe move is RIGHT to (4,9). Enemy cannot reach (4,9) in one move (from (6,2) to (4,9) is too far). Safe.\n\nSince only one move is safe, you must choose RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving RIGHT to (4,9), next turn you can consider moving DOWN to (4,8) (but that is your body segment, so avoid) or RIGHT to (5,9) or UP (but UP is off board) or LEFT (but LEFT to (3,9) is your previous head, which might be safe if it becomes empty? Actually, after you move, your tail moves forward so (2,9) becomes the new tail? Let's simulate: after moving RIGHT to (4,9), your new body becomes: head at (4,9), then (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8) [tail]. So (4,8) is tail. Next turn, from (4,9), possible moves: DOWN to (4,8) is tail? But moving into tail is safe only if it moves away? Actually, rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" But (4,8) is directly behind your head? Not exactly: your head is at (4,9), the segment behind is (3,9) which is not adjacent downward. So DOWN to (4,8) is not directly backwards? Actually, the direction backwards is relative to the movement. Since you moved RIGHT to (4,9), the segment behind is (3,9) which is LEFT. So DOWN is not backwards. However, (4,8) is your body (tail) so moving into it would kill you. So next turn, from (4,9), DOWN is unsafe. Similarly, UP is off board. So only LEFT and RIGHT might be safe. Plan to move RIGHT to (5,9) to continue towards the apple at (9,8). Alternatively, if enemy approaches, be cautious.\n\nRIGHT",

UP would hit my own body at (8, 2).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- Current score: I lead 7-6 against Snake #0\n- From (8, 1), I need to plan my path to collect more apples while staying safe\n- Nearby apples: (9, 2) to the right-up, (0, 1) to the far left, (4, 5) in the center-right\n- Snake #0's head at (6, 9) is on the opposite side, so no immediate collision threat\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n- UP (8, 2): **DEATH** - hits my own body\n- DOWN (8, 0): Safe, but moves away from most apples and toward the edge\n- LEFT (7, 1): Safe, moves toward the center and positions for (0, 1) or (4, 5)\n- RIGHT (9, 1): Safe, positions me one step closer to (9, 2) apple\n\n**Best Strategic Move:**\nRIGHT is the optimal choice. It moves me to (9, 1), putting me directly below the apple at (9, 2). From there, I can move UP to (9, 2) next turn to collect that apple and extend my lead to 8-6. This keeps me on the right side where Snake #0 is not currently competing for apples.\n\nLEFT would be my second choice, moving toward the center and potentially (4, 5), but RIGHT gives me a guaranteed apple path with minimal risk.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:** After collecting (9, 2), consider moving left toward (4, 5) or down toward (0, 1). Stay aware of Snake #0's position and avoid potential head-on collisions. Maintain my lead by efficiently collecting apples while keeping escape routes open.\n\nRIGHT",

You have collected 6 apples.\nApples are at: (9,8), (9,2), (0,6), (0,1), (4,5)\nEnemy snake #1 has head at (8,1) and body segments: [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)]\n\nPossible moves from your head (6,9):\n- UP: (6,10) - outside board (y=10 not allowed, max y=9) -> unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,8) - within board. Check if occupied: not in your body (your body has segments at (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8) - (6,8) is free). Not in enemy body (enemy body has y<=3). Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,9) - your own body segment (first segment) -> unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,9) - within board. Check if occupied: not in your body (your body has x<=6). Not in enemy body (enemy body has x<=8 and y<=3). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #1 at (8,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (8,2) - enemy body segment (first segment) -> unsafe.\n- DOWN: (8,0) - within board. Not in enemy body (enemy body has y>=1). Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,1) - within board. Not in enemy body (enemy body has x>=4). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,1) - within board. Not in enemy body. Safe.\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nCheck for potential head-on collisions:\nYour DOWN to (6,8): enemy cannot reach (6,8) in one move (from (8,1) to (6,8) is too far). Safe.\nYour RIGHT to (7,9): enemy cannot reach (7,9) in one move. Safe.\n\nNow, which move to choose?\nLong-term plan: You want to collect apples. The closest apple is at (9,8). To get there, you need to continue RIGHT to (7,9), then (8,9), (9,9), and then DOWN to (9,8). So RIGHT is aligned with that goal.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy: it is at (8,1) and might go DOWN to (8,0), LEFT to (7,1), or RIGHT to (9,1). It is far from you (top row vs bottom rows), so no immediate threat.\n\nHowever, going DOWN to (6,8) might be useful to avoid potential future traps? But currently, going RIGHT seems better for the apple path.\n\nAlso, check follow-up moves from (6,8) and (7,9):\n- If you go DOWN to (6,8): next turn, from (6,8), possible moves: UP to (6,9) is your body (head was there), DOWN to (6,7) is free, LEFT to (5,8) is free (not in your body? your body has (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8) - (5,8) is free), RIGHT to (7,8) is free. So you would have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- If you go RIGHT to (7,9): next turn, from (7,9), possible moves: DOWN to (7,8) is free, LEFT to (6,9) is your body (head was there), UP off board, RIGHT to (8,9) is free. So you would have DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT has fewer follow-up options (only DOWN and RIGHT), but it progresses toward the apple. DOWN gives more options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) but moves away from the apple.\n\nGiven that the enemy has 7 apples (one more than you) and you need to catch up, prioritizing the apple at (9,8) is important. Also, the board is open at the top, so moving RIGHT should be safe.\n\nTherefore, choose RIGHT.\n\nShort-term plan: Continue moving RIGHT along the top row to approach (9,8). Next turn, from (7,9), you can go DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9). Prefer RIGHT to get closer to the apple, but be ready to go DOWN if needed to avoid dead ends.\n\nRIGHT",

You have collected 6 apples.\nApples are at: (9,8), (0,6), (0,1), (4,5), (2,8)\nEnemy snake #1 has head at (9,2) and body segments: [(9,1), (8,1), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nPossible moves from your head (8,9):\n- UP: (8,10) - outside board (y=10 not allowed, max y=9) -> unsafe.\n- DOWN: (8,8) - within board. Check if occupied: not in your body (your body has segments at (7,9), (6,9), ... (2,9) - (8,8) is free). Not in enemy body (enemy body has y<=3). Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,9) - your own body segment (first segment) -> unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (9,9) - within board. Check if occupied: not in your body. Not in enemy body (enemy body has x<=8 and y<=3). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #1 at (9,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (9,3) - within board. Not in enemy body (enemy body has segments at (9,1), (8,1), (8,2), ... (4,3) - (9,3) is free). Safe.\n- DOWN: (9,1) - enemy body segment (first segment) -> unsafe.\n- LEFT: (8,2) - enemy body segment (third segment) -> unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (10,2) - outside board (x=10 not allowed) -> unsafe.\nSo enemy can only go UP to (9,3).\n\nCheck for potential head-on collisions:\nYour DOWN to (8,8): enemy cannot reach (8,8) in one move (from (9,2) to (8,8) is too far). Safe.\nYour RIGHT to (9,9): enemy cannot reach (9,9) in one move. Safe.\n\nNow, which move to choose?\nLong-term plan: You want to collect the apple at (9,8). From (8,9), going RIGHT to (9,9) gets you adjacent to the apple. Then next turn, from (9,9), you can go DOWN to (9,8) to eat the apple. However, note that the enemy is at (9,2) and moving UP to (9,3). It is still far from the top, so no immediate threat.\n\nGoing DOWN to (8,8) might be safe, but it moves you away from the apple at (9,8). There is another apple at (2,8) which is near your tail? But your tail is at (2,9), so (2,8) is adjacent. However, going DOWN to (8,8) doesn't directly help reach (2,8). Also, the enemy has 8 apples (two more than you), so you should prioritize collecting apples quickly.\n\nTherefore, going RIGHT to (9,9) is the best move to get closer to the apple at (9,8). Next turn, you can go DOWN to (9,8) to eat it.\n\nAlso, check follow-up moves:\n- If you go RIGHT to (9,9): next turn, from (9,9), possible moves: DOWN to (9,8) is free (apple), LEFT to (8,9) is your body (head was there), UP off board, RIGHT off board. So only DOWN is safe. But since (9,8) is an apple, going DOWN is safe and beneficial.\n- If you go DOWN to (8,8): next turn, from (8,8), possible moves: UP to (8,9) is your body, DOWN to (8,7) is free, LEFT to (7,8) is free, RIGHT to (9,8) is free (apple). So you would have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT has only one safe follow-up (DOWN), but it leads to an apple. Since eating an apple adds a segment and opens up more moves (by growing), it is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, choose RIGHT to progress toward the apple.\n\nNote: After eating the apple at (9,8), your head will be at (9,8) and you will grow. Then you can consider moving left or down to avoid being trapped at the corner.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- RIGHT: (10,8) - outside board (x=10 not allowed) -> unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN to (9,7) and LEFT to (8,8).\n\nNow consider enemy snake #1 at (8,3). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (8,4) - within board. Not in enemy body (enemy body has segments at (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2) - (8,4) is free). Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,2) - enemy body segment -> unsafe.\n- LEFT: (7,3) - within board. Check if occupied: not in enemy body (enemy body has x>=5 and y<=3, except (7,2) - (7,3) is free). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,3) - enemy body segment (first segment) -> unsafe.\nSo enemy can go UP to (8,4) or LEFT to (7,3).\n\nCheck for potential head-on collisions:\nYour DOWN to (9,7): enemy cannot reach (9,7) in one move (from (8,3) to (9,7) is too far). Safe.\nYour LEFT to (8,8): enemy cannot reach (8,8) in one move (from (8,3) to (8,8) is too far). Safe.\n\nNow, which move is better?\n- DOWN to (9,7): moves away from the top-right corner. From (9,7), you can later go LEFT to (8,7) or DOWN to (9,6) (since UP is your body and RIGHT is off board). This opens a path downward.\n- LEFT to (8,8): moves left. From (8,8), you can go DOWN to (8,7) or LEFT to (7,8) (since UP is (8,9) which is your body and RIGHT is (9,8) which is your head's current position). This also opens options.\n\nThere is an apple at (9,5) which is below you. Moving DOWN twice would get you to (9,6) then (9,5) to eat it. However, moving LEFT might be better for long-term access to other apples (like (4,5) or (2,8)) and avoiding the edge.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy is at (8,3) and might be moving up or left. It is not an immediate threat.\n\nLong-term plan: You are in the top-right corner. You need to escape this area to avoid being trapped. Moving DOWN to (9,7) is a step away from the corner. Then you can move LEFT to (8,7) and then down to (8,6) etc. to get to the apple at (9,5) or others. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (8,8) is also good to get away from the edge.\n\nSince both moves are safe, I prefer DOWN to (9,7) because it directly moves you toward the apple at (9,5) (which is only two moves away) and opens more downward paths. Also, moving LEFT might lead to a dead end if you go too far left without planning.\n\nTherefore, choose DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Moving LEFT is also safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple.

Safe.\n- RIGHT: (10,6) - outside board -> unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN to (9,5) and LEFT to (8,6).\n\nNow consider enemy snake #1 at (8,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (8,6) - within board. Check if occupied: not in enemy body (enemy body has segments at (8,4), (8,3), ... (7,2) - (8,6) is free). Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,4) - enemy body segment -> unsafe.\n- LEFT: (7,5) - within board.

Check if occupied: not in enemy body (enemy body has segments at (8,4), ... (7,2) - (9,5) is free). Safe.\nSo enemy can go UP to (8,6), LEFT to (7,5), or RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nCheck for potential head-on collisions:\nYour DOWN to (9,5): enemy might go RIGHT to (9,5) - same cell! This would cause a head-on collision and both snakes die. Since enemy has 8 apples (more than your 7), this would be bad for you.\nYour LEFT to (8,6): enemy might go UP to (8,6) - same cell! This would also cause a head-on collision. Both die, and enemy has more apples (8 vs 7) so you lose.\n\nTherefore, both safe moves have a risk of head-on collision if enemy chooses the same direction.\n\nWe need to predict enemy behavior. Enemy is at (8,5). It has an apple at (4,5) to its left and (9,5) to its right. It might be attracted to (9,5) since it's closer? Or to (4,5) which is further but might be safer? Also, enemy might avoid going UP to (8,6) if it sees your head at (9,6) nearby? But snakes move simultaneously.\n\nTo avoid risk, we should choose a move that minimizes the chance of collision. However, both moves are equally risky in terms of head-on collision.\n\nAlternative: consider if enemy has other options. Enemy can also go LEFT to (7,5) which is safe and moves towards the apple at (4,5). So enemy might prefer LEFT to (7,5) to avoid conflict? But we cannot be sure.\n\nSince both moves have the same risk, we should prefer DOWN to (9,5) because it immediately eats an apple (giving you 8 apples, tying with enemy) and grows your snake. If enemy goes RIGHT to (9,5), both die but you tie in apples (8 vs 8) so it's a draw? Actually, if both die and apples are tied, it's a draw. But if you don't eat the apple, you have 7 and enemy has 8, so you lose. So taking the apple is beneficial even if it risks collision.\n\nIf you go LEFT to (8,6) and enemy goes UP to (8,6), both die and you have 7 apples vs enemy 8 - you lose. So LEFT is worse.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is better: if enemy goes RIGHT, both die but you tie in apples (draw). If enemy goes LEFT or UP, you survive and eat the apple.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (9,5), your head will be at (9,5) and your body grows by one segment (so tail remains at (5,9)). Then you can move LEFT to (8,5) or DOWN to (9,4) to escape.\n\nSo choose DOWN to (9,5) to eat the apple and hope enemy chooses LEFT or UP.\n\nDOWN",
