Directly reachable by moving UP. Other apples (9,1) and (9,8) are farther. (4,3) is at distance 2 horizontally, 2 vertically.\n- Opponent at (7,8): possible moves UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8), RIGHT to (8,8). If opponent moves LEFT to (6,8) or DOWN to (7,7), it will not block my path to (6,6). If it moves RIGHT to (8,8), it will eat the apple at (8,8) if not already eaten. If it moves UP to (7,9), it will not block my path.\n\n**Priority apple path**\n- Moving UP to (6,6) is safe and eats the apple at (6,6). Moving RIGHT to (7,5) is safe but moves away from (6,6) and toward (9,1) which is farther. Moving LEFT to (5,5) is safe but moves toward (4,3) which is farther. Moving DOWN to (6,4) is not safe because it is my body.\n- If I move UP to (6,6), I will eat the apple and grow to length 3. Opponent will be at (7,8) or have moved. If opponent moves LEFT to (6,8), it will be above my head at (6,6) and may block my path to other apples in the future. If opponent moves DOWN to (7,7), RIGHT to (8,8), or UP to (7,9), it will not block my path to (6,6) immediately.\n\n**Immediate choice**\n- UP to (6,6) is best: eats the apple, keeps options open for future moves, and avoids potential head-on collision with opponent.\n\n**Plan for next few turns**\n- Move UP now to (6,6) to eat the apple. After eating, I will be at (6,6) with body [(6,5), (6,4)]. Next turn, I can move UP to (6,7) to head toward (9,8) or (8,8), or LEFT to (5,6) to head toward (4,3), depending on opponent's position. Keep monitoring opponent's position to avoid head-on collision.\n\nUP",

If opponent moves UP, it will not collide with me at (7,9).\n\n**Plan for next few turns**\n- Move RIGHT now to (7,9) to get closer to (9,8). After moving, I will be at (7,9) with body [(6,9), (6,8)]. Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (8,9) to head toward (9,8), or LEFT to (6,9) to head toward (1,8), depending on opponent's position.
