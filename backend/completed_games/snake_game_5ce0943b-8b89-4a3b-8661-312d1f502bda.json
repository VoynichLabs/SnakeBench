This keeps me in the safe vertical corridor on the left side of the board.\n\nCurrent apple positions remaining:\n- (2, 2): Distance = 2 steps (straight down) - my next target\n- (1, 9): Distance = |2-1| + |4-9| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps  \n- (0, 8): Distance = |2-0| + |4-8| = 2 + 4 = 6 steps\n- (0, 1): Distance = |2-0| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThe enemy snake at (5, 2) with body at [(6, 2)] is still not a threat - they're on the right side of the board and moving away from my planned path.\n\nMy next move should be DOWN to (2, 3), which puts me one step closer to the apple at (2, 2). After that, I can move DOWN again to collect the apple at (2, 2).\n\nStrategy for future turns: Continue DOWN to (2, 3), then DOWN again to (2, 2) to collect the next apple.

My previous LEFT move was successful and I'm now positioned perfectly to collect the apple at (0, 1).\n\nLet me analyze my current options from position (0, 2):\n- UP: (0, 3) - Safe, empty space\n- DOWN: (0, 1) - This is where the apple is! Perfect!\n- LEFT: (-1, 2) - ILLEGAL! This would be outside the board (wall)\n- RIGHT: (1, 2) - ILLEGAL! This is where my body segment is\n\nCurrent apple positions and distances from (0, 2):\n- (1, 9): Distance = |0-1| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8 steps\n- (0, 8): Distance = |0-0| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6 steps\n- (0, 1): Distance = |0-0| + |2-1| = 0 + 1 = 1 step - ADJACENT!\n- (2, 9): Distance = |0-2| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 steps\n- (6, 9): Distance = |0-6| + |2-9| = 6 + 7 = 13 steps\n\nPerfect! The apple at (0, 1) is directly below me at just 1 step away. This is exactly what I planned:\n1. \u2713 Move LEFT to (1, 2) - COMPLETED\n2. \u2713 Move LEFT to (0, 2) - COMPLETED\n3. Move DOWN to (0, 1) - COLLECT APPLE!\n\nThe enemy snake at (2, 1) with body at [(3, 1)] is still not a threat. They're positioned to the right and won't interfere with my apple collection.\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 1) will give me my first point and grow my snake by one segment.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (0, 1), I'll need to reassess the board. The next closest apple will likely be (0, 8) at 6 steps away (straight up the left wall), or I could consider (1, 9) at 8 steps. I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements and avoid getting trapped against the walls.\n\nDOWN"

Heading straight west risks a collision or missing the apple.\n- Column 2 northbound is blocked by enemy body segments at (2,2),(2,3),(2,4). Column 1 is blocked at (1,2). We cannot go straight up or west and then up.\n- Our own tail is at (3,1). Moving RIGHT into (3,1) is safe because we won\u2019t be growing this turn, so the tail will vacate.\n- Once at (3,1), column 3 from y=2 up to y=9 is clear. We can then head north to the top, swing left to grab the apple at (2,9), and afterwards pursue the cluster at (1,9) or (6,9).\n\nStrategy next turn: Climb north up column 3 toward y=9, then turn LEFT to take the apple at (2,9).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
