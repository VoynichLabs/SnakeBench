            "rationale": "<think> I will not include any thinking in the response part.\n\nFirst, I see the board. My snake is at (5,3) with no body, so just a head. There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (4,3). The enemy snake #0 is at (7,3) with no body either.\n\nI can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see what each move would do:\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). That's an empty space. From (5,4), I can see potential to go towards the apple at (6,5) or (4,3) which is close but already there? Wait, apple at (4,3) is one space away.\n\nCurrent position: (5,3). Apple at (4,3) is directly to the left? X decreases to the left, so from (5,3) to (4,3) is LEFT.\n\nApples: (6,5) is up-right, (3,3) is left, (3,2) is left and down, (1,0) is far left and down, (4,3) is left one step.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to my head? (5,3) to (4,3) is directly left. And there's an apple at (4,3). So if I move LEFT, I go to (4,3) and eat that apple.\n\nBut is that safe? Let me check for collisions.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3), which is to the right. Moving LEFT to (4,3) should be safe because it's away from the enemy.\n\nWhat about other moves:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,3) -> (6,3). That's empty now, but enemy is at (7,3), so if I go right to (6,3), then enemy could move left to (6,3) next turn? No, enemy could move in any direction, but currently at (7,3), it might move left to (6,3) or elsewhere. But if I go to (6,3), and enemy goes to (6,3), I die. But I don't know what the enemy will do. So it's risky to go towards the enemy.\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). Then I'm moving away from the apples except (6,5) which is at (6,5) \u2013 from (5,4) I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5), but that takes two moves. Whereas if I go LEFT now, I eat the apple at (4,3) immediately and grow.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3) -> (5,2). That's towards the apple at (3,2)? (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, but first I go to (5,2), which is empty. Apple at (3,2) is below and left.\n\nBut moving LEFT directly gets me to apple (4,3) and I grow.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is left and up? From (5,3) to (3,3) is two left? X from 5 to 3, y same 3, so two steps left.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer.\n\nNow, is (4,3) occupied? Board shows: at (4,3) it's an apple? Let me see the board state:\n\nRow y=3: ... A A 1 . 0 ... so at x=3,y=3: A (apple), x=4,y=3: A (apple), x=5,y=3: 1 (me), x=6,y=3: . (empty), x=7,y=3: 0 (enemy).\n\nYes, so (4,3) has an apple. So moving LEFT to (4,3) eats it.\n\nNow, after eating, my snake will have a body part at (5,3), and head at (4,3).\n\nEnemy snake at (7,3) with no body, so it might also go for apples.\n\nApples available: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0). (4,3) will be eaten if I go there.\n\n(3,3) is also an apple, but if I go to (4,3), I'm next to (3,3) which is left, so I could go left again to eat it if I want.\n\nBut let's think about safety.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,3) seems safe because:\n\n- No wall: (4,3) is within 0-9.\n\n- No enemy: enemy is at (7,3), far away.\n\n- No self: I have no body, so no collision.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might come towards me, but currently it's not adjacent.\n\nNow, other moves:\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3): That's closer to enemy. If enemy moves left to (6,3), we collide and both die? Or since it's simultaneous, if we both move to same square, both die. So high risk.\n\n- UP to (5,4): Empty, but no immediate apple. Then from there, I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5) to eat that apple in two moves. But apple at (6,5) might be taken by enemy or I might be intercepted.\n\n- DOWN to (5,2): Then I can go left to (4,2) or (3,2) to eat apple at (3,2). But (3,2) is directly left and down from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, or left and down? (3,2) is x=3,y=2, so from (5,2) it's left two, no y change.\n\nBut moving DOWN first to (5,2) doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n\nWhereas LEFT gets me an apple immediately.\n\nAlso, apple at (1,0) is far, not worth going now.\n\nSo LEFT seems best for immediate growth.\n\nBut let's see if there's a trap or something.\n\nEnemy at (7,3) could move left to (6,3), but if I move LEFT to (4,3), I'm safe.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I don't get an apple, so I delay growth.\n\nDOWN to (5,2) is close to apple at (3,2), but still not eating it this turn.\n\nSimilarly, UP to (5,4) not eating apple at (6,5) this turn.\n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT are adjacent to apples? RIGHT to (6,3) is not an apple; apple at (6,5) is up.\n\nFrom (5,3), adjacent positions:\n\n- Left: (4,3) - apple\n\n- Right: (6,3) - empty\n\n- Up: (5,4) - empty\n\n- Down: (5,2) - empty\n\nSo only LEFT gives me an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT.\n\nBut what about the enemy? Could it threaten me?\n\nAfter I move to (4,3), my head is at (4,3), body at (5,3).\n\nEnemy at (7,3): it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf it moves LEFT to (6,3), then it's closer, but not adjacent to me. I'm at (4,3), it at (6,3), so two spaces away.\n\nThen I could move to (3,3) to eat that apple, or to (4,2) or whatever.\n\nNo immediate threat.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN or UP, it goes away.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nIs there any reason not to? For example, if I want to go for multiple apples.\n\nBut eating one apple now is good, and I can plan next.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is right next to where I'll be if I move left, so I could eat that next turn if I want.\n\nWhereas if I go for (6,5), it might take longer.\n\nMoreover, (3,2) is below, etc.\n\nBut immediate gain: LEFT gives me +1 point and growth.\n\nOther moves don't.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nFinally, for next turn, I should remember to consider going for the apple at (3,3) if I move left now.\n\nOr explore other options.\n\nBut for now, move LEFT.",

A 1 T . . 0 .\" and the columns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo: \nx=0: . (but at x=0, it's not shown for y=3, but from context: positions)\nActually, the board is printed with y from top to bottom? No, in the text: \"9 . . .\" down to \"0 . A . ...\"\n\ny=9 at top, y=0 at bottom.\n\nFor y=3 row: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think the dots represent the cells, so let's count the characters.\n\nThe string: \"3 \" + 10 characters? \" . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 that's 10 characters? Let's list:\n\nAfter \"3 \", it's: . (x=0), . (x=1), . (x=2), A (x=3), 1 (x=4), T (x=5), . (x=6), . (x=7), 0 (x=8), . (x=9)\n\nx=0 to x=9 for y=3.\n\nSo:\nx=0: . (empty)\nx=1: . (empty)\nx=2: . (empty)\nx=3: A (apple) \u2014 so (3,3) apple\nx=4: 1 (my head) \u2014 snake 1 head at (4,3)\nx=5: T \u2014 what is T? Body? The user said body at (5,3), so T must represent the body of snake 1.\nx=6: . (empty)\nx=7: . (empty)\nx=8: 0 (enemy snake head at (8,3)? But enemy snake is at (8,3)? User said enemy head at (8,3), not (7,3).\n\nIn the initial description: \"Enemy snakes: Snake #0 - Head: (8,3), Body: none\"\n\nAnd in board: at x=8,y=3: 0, so (8,3)\n\nAlso, apples: at (6,5) and (6,6) from above rows? Let's see:\n\nRow y=5: \"5 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=5: A\n\nRow y=6: \"6 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=6: A\n\nAnd row y=2: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=3,y=2: A\n\nRow y=0: \"0 . A . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=1,y=0: A\n\nSo apples at: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 that matches the list.\n\nNow, my snake: head at (4,3), body at (5,3) \u2014 so one body segment.\n\nLast move I moved LEFT to (4,3)? From last move info, I moved LEFT, but before that my head was at (5,3) with no body? Last move I was at (5,3) head, and I moved LEFT to (4,3), which had an apple, so now I have a body at (5,3).\n\nCurrent state: head at (4,3), body at (5,3). I just ate the apple at (4,3), so now I have a tail.\n\nEnemy snake: head at (8,3), no body.\n\nApples still present: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 but I just ate (4,3), which was one, but it was listed? In the apples list, (4,3) was not listed; listed were (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6). (4,3) was an apple but it was eaten now? In the board, at (4,3) it was my head after move, but before it was apple? Confusion.\n\nInitial apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6)\n\nIn the board before my last move, at (4,3) it was apple? Yes, from last board state.\n\nAfter I moved LEFT to (4,3), I ate that apple, so now (4,3) is my head, and apple at (4,3) is gone.\n\nCurrent apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 but (3,3) is still there, etc.\n\nNo, (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, which is still apple.\n\nIn the current board, (4,3) is my head, so not apple.\n\nApples remain: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNow, possible moves from my head at (4,3):\n\n- LEFT: to (3,3) \u2014 there is an apple there! So I can eat it and grow.\n\n- RIGHT: to (5,3) \u2014 but that's my body at (5,3). If I go there, I collide with myself and die. So not possible.\n\n- UP: to (4,4) \u2014 need to check if empty or what.\n\n- DOWN: to (4,2) \u2014 empty? From board, at (4,2) it should be empty? y=2 row: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" so x=3,y=2 is A, x=4,y=2 is . (empty)\n\nSimilarly, y=4 row: \"4 . . . . . . . . . .\" all empty around that.\n\nNow, enemy snake at (8,3), no body, so it can move freely.\n\nMy possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT to (3,3): that has an apple, so I eat it and grow. Then my head moves to (3,3), body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] \u2014 since I ate, I grow, so tail stays.\n\n2. UP to (4,4): empty, no apple. Then head at (4,4), body follows to (4,3), and tail at (5,3) remains? When I move without eating, the tail moves, so body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] but when I move to (4,4), head to (4,4), body becomes [ (4,3) ] and tail at (5,3) disappears? Standard snake rules: when you don't eat, you move forward, so the tail end moves. Since I have one body segment, moving to (4,4) will leave (5,3) and the body becomes at (4,3), head at (4,4).\n\nCurrent: head (4,3), body (5,3)\n\nAfter move UP to (4,4): head to (4,4), body moves to (4,3). So the tail (5,3) is gone, and I have head at (4,4), body at (4,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat, I grow, so length increases.\n\n3. DOWN to (4,2): empty, no apple. Similar to UP, head to (4,2), body to (4,3), tail (5,3) gone.\n\nNow, RIGHT is invalid since (5,3) is my body.\n\nSo only LEFT, UP, DOWN are possible, but LEFT has an apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) seems very good because I get another apple immediately.\n\nIs it safe?\n\n- Wall: (3,3) is within bounds.\n\n- Self: no, my body is at (5,3) and moving to (4,3) when I move.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (3,3), head at (3,3), body at (4,3), and since I ate, I grow, so tail remains at (5,3)? With growth: when you eat, the head moves to the apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So positions: head at (3,3), body segments: (4,3) and (5,3). So I have length 3 now.\n\nEnemy: at (8,3), far away. It might move towards apples or something.\n\nPossible threats: if enemy moves towards me, but it's 5 spaces away, not immediate.\n\nApples nearby: after eating (3,3), I can go to (3,2) which is apple below, or to (2,3) if empty, etc.\n\n(3,2) is apple at (3,2), which is directly below (3,3).\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN now, I don't get an apple, and I lose the opportunity to eat (3,3) which is adjacent.\n\nFor example, if I move UP to (4,4), then from there, I can go to (4,5) or something, but no apple immediate, and (3,3) is still there but not adjacent to (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (3,3) is left and down, but one step diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't go directly; I need to move to (3,4) first or (4,3) but (4,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving UP, if I go to (4,4), body at (4,3), so (4,3) is body, not free.\n\nThen I can move LEFT to (3,4)? But (3,4) might be empty, but no apple there.\n\nThen from there, I can go DOWN to (3,3) to eat apple, but that takes two moves, and in the meantime, enemy might eat it or something.\n\nSimilarly for DOWN move.\n\nMoreover, by moving LEFT now, I secure the apple quickly.\n\nAlso, with growth, I become longer, which might help in controlling space.\n\nRisk of moving LEFT: only if (3,3) is dangerous, but it has an apple and no obstacle.\n\nEnemy could potentially come, but it's far.\n\nEnemy at (8,3) can move: if it moves LEFT multiple times, it might come to (5,3) or something, but (5,3) is my tail after I move? After I move to (3,3), I have body at (4,3) and (5,3), so (5,3) is my tail.\n\nIf enemy moves left multiple times to (5,3), it might collide if I'm not there, but since it's my tail, if enemy moves to (5,3), it would collide with my body and die, but not affect me directly, as long as I'm not there.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3,2)? I can eat that next turn if I move to (3,3) now.\n\nThen I would have three apples in quick succession if I go (3,3) -> (3,2).\n\nBut first, this turn.\n\nUP or DOWN might be safer in terms of not growing too fast? But growing is good for points.\n\nAvoiding the enemy: enemy is at (8,3), I'm moving left, away, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the apple at (6,6) or (6,5), but they are far, and enemy is closer to them? Enemy at (8,3), (6,5) is at (6,5), which is left and up from enemy.\n\nEnemy could go UP and LEFT to get to (6,5) in two moves: from (8,3) to (7,3) then (6,4)? Not direct.\n\nFrom (8,3) to (6,5): delta x -2, delta y +2, so at least two moves, e.g., (7,4) then (6,5).\n\nBut I am at (4,3), to (6,5) is +2 x, +2 y, also two moves.\n\nBut why go there when I have apples right next to me.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is similar.\n\nSo best to eat the nearby apples.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThen next turn, if possible, move DOWN to (3,2) to eat that apple too.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nFor now, move LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the board.\n\nAfter last move: I moved LEFT to (4,3), ate apple, so now head (4,3), body (5,3).\n\nApples: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 all present except (4,3) gone.\n\nEnemy at (8,3).\n\nNo other snakes.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (3,3) is clear.\n\nI think that's the best move.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple there. This grows my snake and gains a point. The enemy snake is far away at (8,3), so this move is safe. Next turn, I can consider moving DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple if possible.\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think> I will not include any thinking in the response part.\n\nFirst, I see the board. My snake is at (5,3) with no body, so just a head. There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (4,3). The enemy snake #0 is at (7,3) with no body either.\n\nI can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see what each move would do:\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). That's an empty space. From (5,4), I can see potential to go towards the apple at (6,5) or (4,3) which is close but already there? Wait, apple at (4,3) is one space away.\n\nCurrent position: (5,3). Apple at (4,3) is directly to the left? X decreases to the left, so from (5,3) to (4,3) is LEFT.\n\nApples: (6,5) is up-right, (3,3) is left, (3,2) is left and down, (1,0) is far left and down, (4,3) is left one step.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to my head? (5,3) to (4,3) is directly left. And there's an apple at (4,3). So if I move LEFT, I go to (4,3) and eat that apple.\n\nBut is that safe? Let me check for collisions.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3), which is to the right. Moving LEFT to (4,3) should be safe because it's away from the enemy.\n\nWhat about other moves:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,3) -> (6,3). That's empty now, but enemy is at (7,3), so if I go right to (6,3), then enemy could move left to (6,3) next turn? No, enemy could move in any direction, but currently at (7,3), it might move left to (6,3) or elsewhere. But if I go to (6,3), and enemy goes to (6,3), I die. But I don't know what the enemy will do. So it's risky to go towards the enemy.\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). Then I'm moving away from the apples except (6,5) which is at (6,5) \u2013 from (5,4) I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5), but that takes two moves. Whereas if I go LEFT now, I eat the apple at (4,3) immediately and grow.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3) -> (5,2). That's towards the apple at (3,2)? (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, but first I go to (5,2), which is empty. Apple at (3,2) is below and left.\n\nBut moving LEFT directly gets me to apple (4,3) and I grow.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is left and up? From (5,3) to (3,3) is two left? X from 5 to 3, y same 3, so two steps left.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer.\n\nNow, is (4,3) occupied? Board shows: at (4,3) it's an apple? Let me see the board state:\n\nRow y=3: ... A A 1 . 0 ... so at x=3,y=3: A (apple), x=4,y=3: A (apple), x=5,y=3: 1 (me), x=6,y=3: . (empty), x=7,y=3: 0 (enemy).\n\nYes, so (4,3) has an apple. So moving LEFT to (4,3) eats it.\n\nNow, after eating, my snake will have a body part at (5,3), and head at (4,3).\n\nEnemy snake at (7,3) with no body, so it might also go for apples.\n\nApples available: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0). (4,3) will be eaten if I go there.\n\n(3,3) is also an apple, but if I go to (4,3), I'm next to (3,3) which is left, so I could go left again to eat it if I want.\n\nBut let's think about safety.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,3) seems safe because:\n\n- No wall: (4,3) is within 0-9.\n\n- No enemy: enemy is at (7,3), far away.\n\n- No self: I have no body, so no collision.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might come towards me, but currently it's not adjacent.\n\nNow, other moves:\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3): That's closer to enemy. If enemy moves left to (6,3), we collide and both die? Or since it's simultaneous, if we both move to same square, both die. So high risk.\n\n- UP to (5,4): Empty, but no immediate apple. Then from there, I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5) to eat that apple in two moves. But apple at (6,5) might be taken by enemy or I might be intercepted.\n\n- DOWN to (5,2): Then I can go left to (4,2) or (3,2) to eat apple at (3,2). But (3,2) is directly left and down from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, or left and down? (3,2) is x=3,y=2, so from (5,2) it's left two, no y change.\n\nBut moving DOWN first to (5,2) doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n\nWhereas LEFT gets me an apple immediately.\n\nAlso, apple at (1,0) is far, not worth going now.\n\nSo LEFT seems best for immediate growth.\n\nBut let's see if there's a trap or something.\n\nEnemy at (7,3) could move left to (6,3), but if I move LEFT to (4,3), I'm safe.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I don't get an apple, so I delay growth.\n\nDOWN to (5,2) is close to apple at (3,2), but still not eating it this turn.\n\nSimilarly, UP to (5,4) not eating apple at (6,5) this turn.\n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT are adjacent to apples? RIGHT to (6,3) is not an apple; apple at (6,5) is up.\n\nFrom (5,3), adjacent positions:\n\n- Left: (4,3) - apple\n\n- Right: (6,3) - empty\n\n- Up: (5,4) - empty\n\n- Down: (5,2) - empty\n\nSo only LEFT gives me an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT.\n\nBut what about the enemy? Could it threaten me?\n\nAfter I move to (4,3), my head is at (4,3), body at (5,3).\n\nEnemy at (7,3): it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf it moves LEFT to (6,3), then it's closer, but not adjacent to me. I'm at (4,3), it at (6,3), so two spaces away.\n\nThen I could move to (3,3) to eat that apple, or to (4,2) or whatever.\n\nNo immediate threat.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN or UP, it goes away.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nIs there any reason not to? For example, if I want to go for multiple apples.\n\nBut eating one apple now is good, and I can plan next.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is right next to where I'll be if I move left, so I could eat that next turn if I want.\n\nWhereas if I go for (6,5), it might take longer.\n\nMoreover, (3,2) is below, etc.\n\nBut immediate gain: LEFT gives me +1 point and growth.\n\nOther moves don't.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nFinally, for next turn, I should remember to consider going for the apple at (3,3) if I move left now.\n\nOr explore other options.\n\nBut for now, move LEFT.",

A 1 T . . 0 .\" and the columns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo: \nx=0: . (but at x=0, it's not shown for y=3, but from context: positions)\nActually, the board is printed with y from top to bottom? No, in the text: \"9 . . .\" down to \"0 . A . ...\"\n\ny=9 at top, y=0 at bottom.\n\nFor y=3 row: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think the dots represent the cells, so let's count the characters.\n\nThe string: \"3 \" + 10 characters? \" . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 that's 10 characters? Let's list:\n\nAfter \"3 \", it's: . (x=0), . (x=1), . (x=2), A (x=3), 1 (x=4), T (x=5), . (x=6), . (x=7), 0 (x=8), . (x=9)\n\nx=0 to x=9 for y=3.\n\nSo:\nx=0: . (empty)\nx=1: . (empty)\nx=2: . (empty)\nx=3: A (apple) \u2014 so (3,3) apple\nx=4: 1 (my head) \u2014 snake 1 head at (4,3)\nx=5: T \u2014 what is T? Body? The user said body at (5,3), so T must represent the body of snake 1.\nx=6: . (empty)\nx=7: . (empty)\nx=8: 0 (enemy snake head at (8,3)? But enemy snake is at (8,3)? User said enemy head at (8,3), not (7,3).\n\nIn the initial description: \"Enemy snakes: Snake #0 - Head: (8,3), Body: none\"\n\nAnd in board: at x=8,y=3: 0, so (8,3)\n\nAlso, apples: at (6,5) and (6,6) from above rows? Let's see:\n\nRow y=5: \"5 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=5: A\n\nRow y=6: \"6 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=6: A\n\nAnd row y=2: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=3,y=2: A\n\nRow y=0: \"0 . A . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=1,y=0: A\n\nSo apples at: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 that matches the list.\n\nNow, my snake: head at (4,3), body at (5,3) \u2014 so one body segment.\n\nLast move I moved LEFT to (4,3)? From last move info, I moved LEFT, but before that my head was at (5,3) with no body? Last move I was at (5,3) head, and I moved LEFT to (4,3), which had an apple, so now I have a body at (5,3).\n\nCurrent state: head at (4,3), body at (5,3). I just ate the apple at (4,3), so now I have a tail.\n\nEnemy snake: head at (8,3), no body.\n\nApples still present: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 but I just ate (4,3), which was one, but it was listed? In the apples list, (4,3) was not listed; listed were (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6). (4,3) was an apple but it was eaten now? In the board, at (4,3) it was my head after move, but before it was apple? Confusion.\n\nInitial apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6)\n\nIn the board before my last move, at (4,3) it was apple? Yes, from last board state.\n\nAfter I moved LEFT to (4,3), I ate that apple, so now (4,3) is my head, and apple at (4,3) is gone.\n\nCurrent apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 but (3,3) is still there, etc.\n\nNo, (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, which is still apple.\n\nIn the current board, (4,3) is my head, so not apple.\n\nApples remain: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNow, possible moves from my head at (4,3):\n\n- LEFT: to (3,3) \u2014 there is an apple there! So I can eat it and grow.\n\n- RIGHT: to (5,3) \u2014 but that's my body at (5,3). If I go there, I collide with myself and die. So not possible.\n\n- UP: to (4,4) \u2014 need to check if empty or what.\n\n- DOWN: to (4,2) \u2014 empty? From board, at (4,2) it should be empty? y=2 row: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" so x=3,y=2 is A, x=4,y=2 is . (empty)\n\nSimilarly, y=4 row: \"4 . . . . . . . . . .\" all empty around that.\n\nNow, enemy snake at (8,3), no body, so it can move freely.\n\nMy possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT to (3,3): that has an apple, so I eat it and grow. Then my head moves to (3,3), body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] \u2014 since I ate, I grow, so tail stays.\n\n2. UP to (4,4): empty, no apple. Then head at (4,4), body follows to (4,3), and tail at (5,3) remains? When I move without eating, the tail moves, so body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] but when I move to (4,4), head to (4,4), body becomes [ (4,3) ] and tail at (5,3) disappears? Standard snake rules: when you don't eat, you move forward, so the tail end moves. Since I have one body segment, moving to (4,4) will leave (5,3) and the body becomes at (4,3), head at (4,4).\n\nCurrent: head (4,3), body (5,3)\n\nAfter move UP to (4,4): head to (4,4), body moves to (4,3). So the tail (5,3) is gone, and I have head at (4,4), body at (4,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat, I grow, so length increases.\n\n3. DOWN to (4,2): empty, no apple. Similar to UP, head to (4,2), body to (4,3), tail (5,3) gone.\n\nNow, RIGHT is invalid since (5,3) is my body.\n\nSo only LEFT, UP, DOWN are possible, but LEFT has an apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) seems very good because I get another apple immediately.\n\nIs it safe?\n\n- Wall: (3,3) is within bounds.\n\n- Self: no, my body is at (5,3) and moving to (4,3) when I move.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (3,3), head at (3,3), body at (4,3), and since I ate, I grow, so tail remains at (5,3)? With growth: when you eat, the head moves to the apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So positions: head at (3,3), body segments: (4,3) and (5,3). So I have length 3 now.\n\nEnemy: at (8,3), far away. It might move towards apples or something.\n\nPossible threats: if enemy moves towards me, but it's 5 spaces away, not immediate.\n\nApples nearby: after eating (3,3), I can go to (3,2) which is apple below, or to (2,3) if empty, etc.\n\n(3,2) is apple at (3,2), which is directly below (3,3).\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN now, I don't get an apple, and I lose the opportunity to eat (3,3) which is adjacent.\n\nFor example, if I move UP to (4,4), then from there, I can go to (4,5) or something, but no apple immediate, and (3,3) is still there but not adjacent to (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (3,3) is left and down, but one step diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't go directly; I need to move to (3,4) first or (4,3) but (4,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving UP, if I go to (4,4), body at (4,3), so (4,3) is body, not free.\n\nThen I can move LEFT to (3,4)? But (3,4) might be empty, but no apple there.\n\nThen from there, I can go DOWN to (3,3) to eat apple, but that takes two moves, and in the meantime, enemy might eat it or something.\n\nSimilarly for DOWN move.\n\nMoreover, by moving LEFT now, I secure the apple quickly.\n\nAlso, with growth, I become longer, which might help in controlling space.\n\nRisk of moving LEFT: only if (3,3) is dangerous, but it has an apple and no obstacle.\n\nEnemy could potentially come, but it's far.\n\nEnemy at (8,3) can move: if it moves LEFT multiple times, it might come to (5,3) or something, but (5,3) is my tail after I move? After I move to (3,3), I have body at (4,3) and (5,3), so (5,3) is my tail.\n\nIf enemy moves left multiple times to (5,3), it might collide if I'm not there, but since it's my tail, if enemy moves to (5,3), it would collide with my body and die, but not affect me directly, as long as I'm not there.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3,2)? I can eat that next turn if I move to (3,3) now.\n\nThen I would have three apples in quick succession if I go (3,3) -> (3,2).\n\nBut first, this turn.\n\nUP or DOWN might be safer in terms of not growing too fast? But growing is good for points.\n\nAvoiding the enemy: enemy is at (8,3), I'm moving left, away, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the apple at (6,6) or (6,5), but they are far, and enemy is closer to them? Enemy at (8,3), (6,5) is at (6,5), which is left and up from enemy.\n\nEnemy could go UP and LEFT to get to (6,5) in two moves: from (8,3) to (7,3) then (6,4)? Not direct.\n\nFrom (8,3) to (6,5): delta x -2, delta y +2, so at least two moves, e.g., (7,4) then (6,5).\n\nBut I am at (4,3), to (6,5) is +2 x, +2 y, also two moves.\n\nBut why go there when I have apples right next to me.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is similar.\n\nSo best to eat the nearby apples.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThen next turn, if possible, move DOWN to (3,2) to eat that apple too.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nFor now, move LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the board.\n\nAfter last move: I moved LEFT to (4,3), ate apple, so now head (4,3), body (5,3).\n\nApples: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 all present except (4,3) gone.\n\nEnemy at (8,3).\n\nNo other snakes.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (3,3) is clear.\n\nI think that's the best move.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple there. This grows my snake and gains a point. The enemy snake is far away at (8,3), so this move is safe. Next turn, I can consider moving DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple if possible.\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

On the other hand, I'm taking a risk by moving into potentially unknown territory.\n\nMy thought process is something like: \"Okay, I'll just take a step up and see what happens.

Apples are at: (6,5), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6), and (5,8). My snake (ID:1) has its head at (4,3) and body at (5,3). There's one enemy snake (ID:0) at head (8,3) with no body.\n\nFrom the board display:\n- At (4,3): My head\n- At (5,3): My body segment (tail)\n- At (3,3): Apple (visible in the y=3 row: \". . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" meaning (3,3) is 'A')\n- At (3,2): Apple (y=2 row shows \"A\" at x=3)\n- Enemy snake head is at (8,3)\n\nPossible moves from my head (4,3):\n- LEFT to (3,3): This is an apple! If I move here, I eat it and grow. My new head would be at (3,3), body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)].\n- RIGHT to (5,3): This is my own body segment\u2014collision would kill me. Invalid move.\n- UP to (4,4): Empty space (no apple or obstacles).\n- DOWN to (4,2): Empty space (no apple, but (3,2) has an apple adjacent for potential next move).\n\nWhy LEFT is the best immediate move:\n- Eating the apple at (3,3) gains a point and grows my snake to length 3. This makes me stronger for future conflicts.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,3)\u2014far away and not an immediate threat. By moving left, I'm putting more distance between us.\n- After eating (3,3), I can directly access the apple at (3,2) by moving DOWN next turn for another quick point.\n- If I don't take this apple now, the enemy might eventually move toward it or I'd waste turns circling back.\n\nRisks of other moves:\n- UP or DOWN: I don't eat an apple, so I don't grow. My tail (5,3) disappears, leaving me smaller and weaker. Also, I miss the chance to chain apple eats with (3,2).\n- Staying or moving right is suicidal.\n\nLonger-term strategy: After eating (3,3) and potentially (3,2), I should path toward the cluster of apples at (6,5)/(6,6) while monitoring the enemy. The apple at (5,8) is isolated\u2014low priority for now. Enemy has no body, so it's vulnerable; if it makes a mistake, I can corner it later.\n\nFor this turn, LEFT is clearly optimal. I'll commit to that.\n\n</think>\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

            "rationale": "<think> I will not include any thinking in the response part.\n\nFirst, I see the board. My snake is at (5,3) with no body, so just a head. There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (4,3). The enemy snake #0 is at (7,3) with no body either.\n\nI can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see what each move would do:\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). That's an empty space. From (5,4), I can see potential to go towards the apple at (6,5) or (4,3) which is close but already there? Wait, apple at (4,3) is one space away.\n\nCurrent position: (5,3). Apple at (4,3) is directly to the left? X decreases to the left, so from (5,3) to (4,3) is LEFT.\n\nApples: (6,5) is up-right, (3,3) is left, (3,2) is left and down, (1,0) is far left and down, (4,3) is left one step.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to my head? (5,3) to (4,3) is directly left. And there's an apple at (4,3). So if I move LEFT, I go to (4,3) and eat that apple.\n\nBut is that safe? Let me check for collisions.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3), which is to the right. Moving LEFT to (4,3) should be safe because it's away from the enemy.\n\nWhat about other moves:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,3) -> (6,3). That's empty now, but enemy is at (7,3), so if I go right to (6,3), then enemy could move left to (6,3) next turn? No, enemy could move in any direction, but currently at (7,3), it might move left to (6,3) or elsewhere. But if I go to (6,3), and enemy goes to (6,3), I die. But I don't know what the enemy will do. So it's risky to go towards the enemy.\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). Then I'm moving away from the apples except (6,5) which is at (6,5) \u2013 from (5,4) I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5), but that takes two moves. Whereas if I go LEFT now, I eat the apple at (4,3) immediately and grow.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3) -> (5,2). That's towards the apple at (3,2)? (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, but first I go to (5,2), which is empty. Apple at (3,2) is below and left.\n\nBut moving LEFT directly gets me to apple (4,3) and I grow.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is left and up? From (5,3) to (3,3) is two left? X from 5 to 3, y same 3, so two steps left.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer.\n\nNow, is (4,3) occupied? Board shows: at (4,3) it's an apple? Let me see the board state:\n\nRow y=3: ... A A 1 . 0 ... so at x=3,y=3: A (apple), x=4,y=3: A (apple), x=5,y=3: 1 (me), x=6,y=3: . (empty), x=7,y=3: 0 (enemy).\n\nYes, so (4,3) has an apple. So moving LEFT to (4,3) eats it.\n\nNow, after eating, my snake will have a body part at (5,3), and head at (4,3).\n\nEnemy snake at (7,3) with no body, so it might also go for apples.\n\nApples available: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0). (4,3) will be eaten if I go there.\n\n(3,3) is also an apple, but if I go to (4,3), I'm next to (3,3) which is left, so I could go left again to eat it if I want.\n\nBut let's think about safety.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,3) seems safe because:\n\n- No wall: (4,3) is within 0-9.\n\n- No enemy: enemy is at (7,3), far away.\n\n- No self: I have no body, so no collision.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might come towards me, but currently it's not adjacent.\n\nNow, other moves:\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3): That's closer to enemy. If enemy moves left to (6,3), we collide and both die? Or since it's simultaneous, if we both move to same square, both die. So high risk.\n\n- UP to (5,4): Empty, but no immediate apple. Then from there, I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5) to eat that apple in two moves. But apple at (6,5) might be taken by enemy or I might be intercepted.\n\n- DOWN to (5,2): Then I can go left to (4,2) or (3,2) to eat apple at (3,2). But (3,2) is directly left and down from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, or left and down? (3,2) is x=3,y=2, so from (5,2) it's left two, no y change.\n\nBut moving DOWN first to (5,2) doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n\nWhereas LEFT gets me an apple immediately.\n\nAlso, apple at (1,0) is far, not worth going now.\n\nSo LEFT seems best for immediate growth.\n\nBut let's see if there's a trap or something.\n\nEnemy at (7,3) could move left to (6,3), but if I move LEFT to (4,3), I'm safe.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I don't get an apple, so I delay growth.\n\nDOWN to (5,2) is close to apple at (3,2), but still not eating it this turn.\n\nSimilarly, UP to (5,4) not eating apple at (6,5) this turn.\n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT are adjacent to apples? RIGHT to (6,3) is not an apple; apple at (6,5) is up.\n\nFrom (5,3), adjacent positions:\n\n- Left: (4,3) - apple\n\n- Right: (6,3) - empty\n\n- Up: (5,4) - empty\n\n- Down: (5,2) - empty\n\nSo only LEFT gives me an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT.\n\nBut what about the enemy? Could it threaten me?\n\nAfter I move to (4,3), my head is at (4,3), body at (5,3).\n\nEnemy at (7,3): it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf it moves LEFT to (6,3), then it's closer, but not adjacent to me. I'm at (4,3), it at (6,3), so two spaces away.\n\nThen I could move to (3,3) to eat that apple, or to (4,2) or whatever.\n\nNo immediate threat.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN or UP, it goes away.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nIs there any reason not to? For example, if I want to go for multiple apples.\n\nBut eating one apple now is good, and I can plan next.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is right next to where I'll be if I move left, so I could eat that next turn if I want.\n\nWhereas if I go for (6,5), it might take longer.\n\nMoreover, (3,2) is below, etc.\n\nBut immediate gain: LEFT gives me +1 point and growth.\n\nOther moves don't.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nFinally, for next turn, I should remember to consider going for the apple at (3,3) if I move left now.\n\nOr explore other options.\n\nBut for now, move LEFT.",

Apples are at: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (6,6) \u2014 wait, the apples listed are (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (6,6)? But in the board display, I see apples at (6,5), (6,6)? No:\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Row y=5: ... . . . . . . A . . . \u2192 so (6,5) has apple\n- Row y=6: ... . . . . . . A . . . \u2192 (6,6) has apple? But apples listed are (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 that's five apples.\n\nIn the board:\ny=3: ... A A 1 T . . 0 ... \u2192 positions: (3,3) is A, (4,3) is A? No, let's parse:\nThe row for y=3: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think it's:\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: A (apple at (3,3))\nx=4: 1 (my head? But my head is at (4,3), and body at (5,3)? In the snake info, head is (4,3), body: [(5,3)]\n\nIn the board:\n\"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\"\n\nPerhaps the representation: it says \"A 1 T\" \u2014 T? That might be a typo or something. The user said: \"at (4,3) it's '1' for my head, and (5,3) is body? But in the string: \"A 1 T\" \u2014 let's see the columns.\n\nThe board row for y=3: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" and the columns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo: \nx=0: . (but at x=0, it's not shown for y=3, but from context: positions)\nActually, the board is printed with y from top to bottom? No, in the text: \"9 . . .\" down to \"0 . A . ...\"\n\ny=9 at top, y=0 at bottom.\n\nFor y=3 row: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think the dots represent the cells, so let's count the characters.\n\nThe string: \"3 \" + 10 characters? \" . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 that's 10 characters? Let's list:\n\nAfter \"3 \", it's: . (x=0), . (x=1), . (x=2), A (x=3), 1 (x=4), T (x=5), . (x=6), . (x=7), 0 (x=8), . (x=9)\n\nx=0 to x=9 for y=3.\n\nSo:\nx=0: . (empty)\nx=1: . (empty)\nx=2: . (empty)\nx=3: A (apple) \u2014 so (3,3) apple\nx=4: 1 (my head) \u2014 snake 1 head at (4,3)\nx=5: T \u2014 what is T? Body? The user said body at (5,3), so T must represent the body of snake 1.\nx=6: . (empty)\nx=7: . (empty)\nx=8: 0 (enemy snake head at (8,3)? But enemy snake is at (8,3)? User said enemy head at (8,3), not (7,3).\n\nIn the initial description: \"Enemy snakes: Snake #0 - Head: (8,3), Body: none\"\n\nAnd in board: at x=8,y=3: 0, so (8,3)\n\nAlso, apples: at (6,5) and (6,6) from above rows? Let's see:\n\nRow y=5: \"5 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=5: A\n\nRow y=6: \"6 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=6: A\n\nAnd row y=2: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=3,y=2: A\n\nRow y=0: \"0 . A . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=1,y=0: A\n\nSo apples at: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 that matches the list.\n\nNow, my snake: head at (4,3), body at (5,3) \u2014 so one body segment.\n\nLast move I moved LEFT to (4,3)? From last move info, I moved LEFT, but before that my head was at (5,3) with no body? Last move I was at (5,3) head, and I moved LEFT to (4,3), which had an apple, so now I have a body at (5,3).\n\nCurrent state: head at (4,3), body at (5,3). I just ate the apple at (4,3), so now I have a tail.\n\nEnemy snake: head at (8,3), no body.\n\nApples still present: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 but I just ate (4,3), which was one, but it was listed? In the apples list, (4,3) was not listed; listed were (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6). (4,3) was an apple but it was eaten now? In the board, at (4,3) it was my head after move, but before it was apple? Confusion.\n\nInitial apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6)\n\nIn the board before my last move, at (4,3) it was apple? Yes, from last board state.\n\nAfter I moved LEFT to (4,3), I ate that apple, so now (4,3) is my head, and apple at (4,3) is gone.\n\nCurrent apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 but (3,3) is still there, etc.\n\nNo, (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, which is still apple.\n\nIn the current board, (4,3) is my head, so not apple.\n\nApples remain: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNow, possible moves from my head at (4,3):\n\n- LEFT: to (3,3) \u2014 there is an apple there! So I can eat it and grow.\n\n- RIGHT: to (5,3) \u2014 but that's my body at (5,3). If I go there, I collide with myself and die. So not possible.\n\n- UP: to (4,4) \u2014 need to check if empty or what.\n\n- DOWN: to (4,2) \u2014 empty? From board, at (4,2) it should be empty? y=2 row: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" so x=3,y=2 is A, x=4,y=2 is . (empty)\n\nSimilarly, y=4 row: \"4 . . . . . . . . . .\" all empty around that.\n\nNow, enemy snake at (8,3), no body, so it can move freely.\n\nMy possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT to (3,3): that has an apple, so I eat it and grow. Then my head moves to (3,3), body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] \u2014 since I ate, I grow, so tail stays.\n\n2. UP to (4,4): empty, no apple. Then head at (4,4), body follows to (4,3), and tail at (5,3) remains? When I move without eating, the tail moves, so body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] but when I move to (4,4), head to (4,4), body becomes [ (4,3) ] and tail at (5,3) disappears? Standard snake rules: when you don't eat, you move forward, so the tail end moves. Since I have one body segment, moving to (4,4) will leave (5,3) and the body becomes at (4,3), head at (4,4).\n\nCurrent: head (4,3), body (5,3)\n\nAfter move UP to (4,4): head to (4,4), body moves to (4,3). So the tail (5,3) is gone, and I have head at (4,4), body at (4,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat, I grow, so length increases.\n\n3. DOWN to (4,2): empty, no apple. Similar to UP, head to (4,2), body to (4,3), tail (5,3) gone.\n\nNow, RIGHT is invalid since (5,3) is my body.\n\nSo only LEFT, UP, DOWN are possible, but LEFT has an apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) seems very good because I get another apple immediately.\n\nIs it safe?\n\n- Wall: (3,3) is within bounds.\n\n- Self: no, my body is at (5,3) and moving to (4,3) when I move.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (3,3), head at (3,3), body at (4,3), and since I ate, I grow, so tail remains at (5,3)? With growth: when you eat, the head moves to the apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So positions: head at (3,3), body segments: (4,3) and (5,3). So I have length 3 now.\n\nEnemy: at (8,3), far away. It might move towards apples or something.\n\nPossible threats: if enemy moves towards me, but it's 5 spaces away, not immediate.\n\nApples nearby: after eating (3,3), I can go to (3,2) which is apple below, or to (2,3) if empty, etc.\n\n(3,2) is apple at (3,2), which is directly below (3,3).\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN now, I don't get an apple, and I lose the opportunity to eat (3,3) which is adjacent.\n\nFor example, if I move UP to (4,4), then from there, I can go to (4,5) or something, but no apple immediate, and (3,3) is still there but not adjacent to (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (3,3) is left and down, but one step diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't go directly; I need to move to (3,4) first or (4,3) but (4,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving UP, if I go to (4,4), body at (4,3), so (4,3) is body, not free.\n\nThen I can move LEFT to (3,4)? But (3,4) might be empty, but no apple there.\n\nThen from there, I can go DOWN to (3,3) to eat apple, but that takes two moves, and in the meantime, enemy might eat it or something.\n\nSimilarly for DOWN move.\n\nMoreover, by moving LEFT now, I secure the apple quickly.\n\nAlso, with growth, I become longer, which might help in controlling space.\n\nRisk of moving LEFT: only if (3,3) is dangerous, but it has an apple and no obstacle.\n\nEnemy could potentially come, but it's far.\n\nEnemy at (8,3) can move: if it moves LEFT multiple times, it might come to (5,3) or something, but (5,3) is my tail after I move? After I move to (3,3), I have body at (4,3) and (5,3), so (5,3) is my tail.\n\nIf enemy moves left multiple times to (5,3), it might collide if I'm not there, but since it's my tail, if enemy moves to (5,3), it would collide with my body and die, but not affect me directly, as long as I'm not there.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3,2)? I can eat that next turn if I move to (3,3) now.\n\nThen I would have three apples in quick succession if I go (3,3) -> (3,2).\n\nBut first, this turn.\n\nUP or DOWN might be safer in terms of not growing too fast? But growing is good for points.\n\nAvoiding the enemy: enemy is at (8,3), I'm moving left, away, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the apple at (6,6) or (6,5), but they are far, and enemy is closer to them? Enemy at (8,3), (6,5) is at (6,5), which is left and up from enemy.\n\nEnemy could go UP and LEFT to get to (6,5) in two moves: from (8,3) to (7,3) then (6,4)? Not direct.\n\nFrom (8,3) to (6,5): delta x -2, delta y +2, so at least two moves, e.g., (7,4) then (6,5).\n\nBut I am at (4,3), to (6,5) is +2 x, +2 y, also two moves.\n\nBut why go there when I have apples right next to me.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is similar.\n\nSo best to eat the nearby apples.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThen next turn, if possible, move DOWN to (3,2) to eat that apple too.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nFor now, move LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the board.\n\nAfter last move: I moved LEFT to (4,3), ate apple, so now head (4,3), body (5,3).\n\nApples: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 all present except (4,3) gone.\n\nEnemy at (8,3).\n\nNo other snakes.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (3,3) is clear.\n\nI think that's the best move.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple there. This grows my snake and gains a point. The enemy snake is far away at (8,3), so this move is safe. Next turn, I can consider moving DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple if possible.\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

This makes me stronger for future conflicts.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,3)\u2014far away and not an immediate threat. By moving left, I'm putting more distance between us.\n- After eating (3,3), I can directly access the apple at (3,2) by moving DOWN next turn for another quick point.\n- If I don't take this apple now, the enemy might eventually move toward it or I'd waste turns circling back.\n\nRisks of other moves:\n- UP or DOWN: I don't eat an apple, so I don't grow. My tail (5,3) disappears, leaving me smaller and weaker. Also, I miss the chance to chain apple eats with (3,2).\n- Staying or moving right is suicidal.\n\nLonger-term strategy: After eating (3,3) and potentially (3,2), I should path toward the cluster of apples at (6,5)/(6,6) while monitoring the enemy. The apple at (5,8) is isolated\u2014low priority for now. Enemy has no body, so it's vulnerable; if it makes a mistake, I can corner it later.\n\nFor this turn, LEFT is clearly optimal.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at bottom-left to (9,9) at top-right. Apples are at: (6,5), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6), and (5,8).

A . . . . . .\" \u2014 'A' at x=3, y=2 is an apple.\n- Row y=0: \". A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 'A' at x=1, y=0 is an apple.\n- Other apples: (6,5), (6,6), (5,8) are visible in their respective rows.\n\nMy snake's current position:\n- Head: (2,3)\n- Body: [(3,3), (4,3)] \u2014 so I have a length of 3.\n\nPossible moves from my head (2,3):\n- LEFT to (1,3): This would move to x=1, y=3. The board shows no obstacles there\u2014it's empty ('.' in the grid row for y=3). Moving left is safe and doesn't hit anything.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): This is my own body segment (the first 'T'). If I move here, I collide with myself and die. Invalid move.\n- UP to (2,4): Empty space (no apple or obstacles).\n- DOWN to (2,2): Empty space. Apple at (3,2) is adjacent but not directly on this path.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving LEFT to (1,3) is safe and positions me to potentially go down to (1,2) or (1,1) toward the apple at (1,0) soon. It also avoids immediate risks.\n- Moving UP to (2,4) or DOWN to (2,2) are also safe but don't gain an apple immediately. Down might be better to get closer to the apple at (3,2) next turn.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,5), far away. No threat this turn. It can move, but I don't need to react yet.\n\nBest move: LEFT\n- Why? It's safe, and it opens a path to the apple at (1,0). After moving to (1,3), I can move DOWN to (1,2) and then to (1,1) or (1,0) to eat the apple. Eating apples quickly grows my snake, making me more resilient against the enemy later.\n- Alternative: DOWN to (2,2) gets me closer to the apple at (3,2), but I can't eat it this turn. Next turn, from (2,2), I could move RIGHT to (3,2) to eat it. However, LEFT is slightly better because it starts a path to a cluster\u2014after (1,0), I can head toward other apples.\n- Risk of UP: Moves me away from apples, wasting time. I should prioritize apple collection.\n\nLong-term strategy: After eating (1,0), I should target (3,2), then the apples around (6,5) and (6,6). The enemy snake has no body, so it's weak\u2014I can try to trap it later if it grows. For now, focus on growth.\n\nI'll go with LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

A potential strategy for me is to grow in length by reaching an apple.\n\nThe nearest apple to my head (7, 3) is at (6, 5), but it might be intercepted by other snakes on the board, like Snake #1. I should also try to create distance from the other snakes to avoid collisions.\n\nAs I consider downs and ups, since the closest apple (6, 5) is reachable via a move to the right I'd say my next move should aim to align with the apple's spot on the x-axis and also give me some x-axis growth, making me less probable to go in a collision with another snake going rightward.\n\nHmmm, therefore my next move should be...

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think> I will not include any thinking in the response part.\n\nFirst, I see the board. My snake is at (5,3) with no body, so just a head. There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (4,3). The enemy snake #0 is at (7,3) with no body either.\n\nI can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see what each move would do:\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). That's an empty space. From (5,4), I can see potential to go towards the apple at (6,5) or (4,3) which is close but already there? Wait, apple at (4,3) is one space away.\n\nCurrent position: (5,3). Apple at (4,3) is directly to the left? X decreases to the left, so from (5,3) to (4,3) is LEFT.\n\nApples: (6,5) is up-right, (3,3) is left, (3,2) is left and down, (1,0) is far left and down, (4,3) is left one step.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to my head? (5,3) to (4,3) is directly left. And there's an apple at (4,3). So if I move LEFT, I go to (4,3) and eat that apple.\n\nBut is that safe? Let me check for collisions.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3), which is to the right. Moving LEFT to (4,3) should be safe because it's away from the enemy.\n\nWhat about other moves:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,3) -> (6,3). That's empty now, but enemy is at (7,3), so if I go right to (6,3), then enemy could move left to (6,3) next turn? No, enemy could move in any direction, but currently at (7,3), it might move left to (6,3) or elsewhere. But if I go to (6,3), and enemy goes to (6,3), I die. But I don't know what the enemy will do. So it's risky to go towards the enemy.\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). Then I'm moving away from the apples except (6,5) which is at (6,5) \u2013 from (5,4) I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5), but that takes two moves. Whereas if I go LEFT now, I eat the apple at (4,3) immediately and grow.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3) -> (5,2). That's towards the apple at (3,2)? (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, but first I go to (5,2), which is empty. Apple at (3,2) is below and left.\n\nBut moving LEFT directly gets me to apple (4,3) and I grow.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is left and up? From (5,3) to (3,3) is two left? X from 5 to 3, y same 3, so two steps left.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer.\n\nNow, is (4,3) occupied? Board shows: at (4,3) it's an apple? Let me see the board state:\n\nRow y=3: ... A A 1 . 0 ... so at x=3,y=3: A (apple), x=4,y=3: A (apple), x=5,y=3: 1 (me), x=6,y=3: . (empty), x=7,y=3: 0 (enemy).\n\nYes, so (4,3) has an apple. So moving LEFT to (4,3) eats it.\n\nNow, after eating, my snake will have a body part at (5,3), and head at (4,3).\n\nEnemy snake at (7,3) with no body, so it might also go for apples.\n\nApples available: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0). (4,3) will be eaten if I go there.\n\n(3,3) is also an apple, but if I go to (4,3), I'm next to (3,3) which is left, so I could go left again to eat it if I want.\n\nBut let's think about safety.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,3) seems safe because:\n\n- No wall: (4,3) is within 0-9.\n\n- No enemy: enemy is at (7,3), far away.\n\n- No self: I have no body, so no collision.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might come towards me, but currently it's not adjacent.\n\nNow, other moves:\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3): That's closer to enemy. If enemy moves left to (6,3), we collide and both die? Or since it's simultaneous, if we both move to same square, both die. So high risk.\n\n- UP to (5,4): Empty, but no immediate apple. Then from there, I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5) to eat that apple in two moves. But apple at (6,5) might be taken by enemy or I might be intercepted.\n\n- DOWN to (5,2): Then I can go left to (4,2) or (3,2) to eat apple at (3,2). But (3,2) is directly left and down from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, or left and down? (3,2) is x=3,y=2, so from (5,2) it's left two, no y change.\n\nBut moving DOWN first to (5,2) doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n\nWhereas LEFT gets me an apple immediately.\n\nAlso, apple at (1,0) is far, not worth going now.\n\nSo LEFT seems best for immediate growth.\n\nBut let's see if there's a trap or something.\n\nEnemy at (7,3) could move left to (6,3), but if I move LEFT to (4,3), I'm safe.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I don't get an apple, so I delay growth.\n\nDOWN to (5,2) is close to apple at (3,2), but still not eating it this turn.\n\nSimilarly, UP to (5,4) not eating apple at (6,5) this turn.\n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT are adjacent to apples? RIGHT to (6,3) is not an apple; apple at (6,5) is up.\n\nFrom (5,3), adjacent positions:\n\n- Left: (4,3) - apple\n\n- Right: (6,3) - empty\n\n- Up: (5,4) - empty\n\n- Down: (5,2) - empty\n\nSo only LEFT gives me an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT.\n\nBut what about the enemy? Could it threaten me?\n\nAfter I move to (4,3), my head is at (4,3), body at (5,3).\n\nEnemy at (7,3): it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf it moves LEFT to (6,3), then it's closer, but not adjacent to me. I'm at (4,3), it at (6,3), so two spaces away.\n\nThen I could move to (3,3) to eat that apple, or to (4,2) or whatever.\n\nNo immediate threat.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN or UP, it goes away.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nIs there any reason not to? For example, if I want to go for multiple apples.\n\nBut eating one apple now is good, and I can plan next.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is right next to where I'll be if I move left, so I could eat that next turn if I want.\n\nWhereas if I go for (6,5), it might take longer.\n\nMoreover, (3,2) is below, etc.\n\nBut immediate gain: LEFT gives me +1 point and growth.\n\nOther moves don't.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nFinally, for next turn, I should remember to consider going for the apple at (3,3) if I move left now.\n\nOr explore other options.\n\nBut for now, move LEFT.",

            "rationale": "<think>  I'll think step by step about the current board state and possible moves.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. Apples are at: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (6,6) \u2014 wait, the apples listed are (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (6,6)? But in the board display, I see apples at (6,5), (6,6)? No:\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Row y=5: ... . . . . . . A . . . \u2192 so (6,5) has apple\n- Row y=6: ... . . . . . . A . . . \u2192 (6,6) has apple? But apples listed are (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 that's five apples.\n\nIn the board:\ny=3: ... A A 1 T . . 0 ... \u2192 positions: (3,3) is A, (4,3) is A? No, let's parse:\nThe row for y=3: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think it's:\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: A (apple at (3,3))\nx=4: 1 (my head? But my head is at (4,3), and body at (5,3)? In the snake info, head is (4,3), body: [(5,3)]\n\nIn the board:\n\"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\"\n\nPerhaps the representation: it says \"A 1 T\" \u2014 T? That might be a typo or something. The user said: \"at (4,3) it's '1' for my head, and (5,3) is body? But in the string: \"A 1 T\" \u2014 let's see the columns.\n\nThe board row for y=3: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" and the columns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo: \nx=0: . (but at x=0, it's not shown for y=3, but from context: positions)\nActually, the board is printed with y from top to bottom? No, in the text: \"9 . . .\" down to \"0 . A . ...\"\n\ny=9 at top, y=0 at bottom.\n\nFor y=3 row: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think the dots represent the cells, so let's count the characters.\n\nThe string: \"3 \" + 10 characters? \" . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 that's 10 characters? Let's list:\n\nAfter \"3 \", it's: . (x=0), . (x=1), . (x=2), A (x=3), 1 (x=4), T (x=5), . (x=6), . (x=7), 0 (x=8), . (x=9)\n\nx=0 to x=9 for y=3.\n\nSo:\nx=0: . (empty)\nx=1: . (empty)\nx=2: . (empty)\nx=3: A (apple) \u2014 so (3,3) apple\nx=4: 1 (my head) \u2014 snake 1 head at (4,3)\nx=5: T \u2014 what is T? Body? The user said body at (5,3), so T must represent the body of snake 1.\nx=6: . (empty)\nx=7: . (empty)\nx=8: 0 (enemy snake head at (8,3)? But enemy snake is at (8,3)? User said enemy head at (8,3), not (7,3).\n\nIn the initial description: \"Enemy snakes: Snake #0 - Head: (8,3), Body: none\"\n\nAnd in board: at x=8,y=3: 0, so (8,3)\n\nAlso, apples: at (6,5) and (6,6) from above rows? Let's see:\n\nRow y=5: \"5 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=5: A\n\nRow y=6: \"6 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=6: A\n\nAnd row y=2: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=3,y=2: A\n\nRow y=0: \"0 . A . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=1,y=0: A\n\nSo apples at: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 that matches the list.\n\nNow, my snake: head at (4,3), body at (5,3) \u2014 so one body segment.\n\nLast move I moved LEFT to (4,3)? From last move info, I moved LEFT, but before that my head was at (5,3) with no body? Last move I was at (5,3) head, and I moved LEFT to (4,3), which had an apple, so now I have a body at (5,3).\n\nCurrent state: head at (4,3), body at (5,3). I just ate the apple at (4,3), so now I have a tail.\n\nEnemy snake: head at (8,3), no body.\n\nApples still present: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 but I just ate (4,3), which was one, but it was listed? In the apples list, (4,3) was not listed; listed were (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6). (4,3) was an apple but it was eaten now? In the board, at (4,3) it was my head after move, but before it was apple? Confusion.\n\nInitial apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6)\n\nIn the board before my last move, at (4,3) it was apple? Yes, from last board state.\n\nAfter I moved LEFT to (4,3), I ate that apple, so now (4,3) is my head, and apple at (4,3) is gone.\n\nCurrent apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 but (3,3) is still there, etc.\n\nNo, (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, which is still apple.\n\nIn the current board, (4,3) is my head, so not apple.\n\nApples remain: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNow, possible moves from my head at (4,3):\n\n- LEFT: to (3,3) \u2014 there is an apple there! So I can eat it and grow.\n\n- RIGHT: to (5,3) \u2014 but that's my body at (5,3). If I go there, I collide with myself and die. So not possible.\n\n- UP: to (4,4) \u2014 need to check if empty or what.\n\n- DOWN: to (4,2) \u2014 empty? From board, at (4,2) it should be empty? y=2 row: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" so x=3,y=2 is A, x=4,y=2 is . (empty)\n\nSimilarly, y=4 row: \"4 . . . . . . . . . .\" all empty around that.\n\nNow, enemy snake at (8,3), no body, so it can move freely.\n\nMy possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT to (3,3): that has an apple, so I eat it and grow. Then my head moves to (3,3), body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] \u2014 since I ate, I grow, so tail stays.\n\n2. UP to (4,4): empty, no apple. Then head at (4,4), body follows to (4,3), and tail at (5,3) remains? When I move without eating, the tail moves, so body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] but when I move to (4,4), head to (4,4), body becomes [ (4,3) ] and tail at (5,3) disappears? Standard snake rules: when you don't eat, you move forward, so the tail end moves. Since I have one body segment, moving to (4,4) will leave (5,3) and the body becomes at (4,3), head at (4,4).\n\nCurrent: head (4,3), body (5,3)\n\nAfter move UP to (4,4): head to (4,4), body moves to (4,3). So the tail (5,3) is gone, and I have head at (4,4), body at (4,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat, I grow, so length increases.\n\n3. DOWN to (4,2): empty, no apple. Similar to UP, head to (4,2), body to (4,3), tail (5,3) gone.\n\nNow, RIGHT is invalid since (5,3) is my body.\n\nSo only LEFT, UP, DOWN are possible, but LEFT has an apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) seems very good because I get another apple immediately.\n\nIs it safe?\n\n- Wall: (3,3) is within bounds.\n\n- Self: no, my body is at (5,3) and moving to (4,3) when I move.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (3,3), head at (3,3), body at (4,3), and since I ate, I grow, so tail remains at (5,3)? With growth: when you eat, the head moves to the apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So positions: head at (3,3), body segments: (4,3) and (5,3). So I have length 3 now.\n\nEnemy: at (8,3), far away. It might move towards apples or something.\n\nPossible threats: if enemy moves towards me, but it's 5 spaces away, not immediate.\n\nApples nearby: after eating (3,3), I can go to (3,2) which is apple below, or to (2,3) if empty, etc.\n\n(3,2) is apple at (3,2), which is directly below (3,3).\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN now, I don't get an apple, and I lose the opportunity to eat (3,3) which is adjacent.\n\nFor example, if I move UP to (4,4), then from there, I can go to (4,5) or something, but no apple immediate, and (3,3) is still there but not adjacent to (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (3,3) is left and down, but one step diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't go directly; I need to move to (3,4) first or (4,3) but (4,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving UP, if I go to (4,4), body at (4,3), so (4,3) is body, not free.\n\nThen I can move LEFT to (3,4)? But (3,4) might be empty, but no apple there.\n\nThen from there, I can go DOWN to (3,3) to eat apple, but that takes two moves, and in the meantime, enemy might eat it or something.\n\nSimilarly for DOWN move.\n\nMoreover, by moving LEFT now, I secure the apple quickly.\n\nAlso, with growth, I become longer, which might help in controlling space.\n\nRisk of moving LEFT: only if (3,3) is dangerous, but it has an apple and no obstacle.\n\nEnemy could potentially come, but it's far.\n\nEnemy at (8,3) can move: if it moves LEFT multiple times, it might come to (5,3) or something, but (5,3) is my tail after I move? After I move to (3,3), I have body at (4,3) and (5,3), so (5,3) is my tail.\n\nIf enemy moves left multiple times to (5,3), it might collide if I'm not there, but since it's my tail, if enemy moves to (5,3), it would collide with my body and die, but not affect me directly, as long as I'm not there.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3,2)? I can eat that next turn if I move to (3,3) now.\n\nThen I would have three apples in quick succession if I go (3,3) -> (3,2).\n\nBut first, this turn.\n\nUP or DOWN might be safer in terms of not growing too fast? But growing is good for points.\n\nAvoiding the enemy: enemy is at (8,3), I'm moving left, away, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the apple at (6,6) or (6,5), but they are far, and enemy is closer to them? Enemy at (8,3), (6,5) is at (6,5), which is left and up from enemy.\n\nEnemy could go UP and LEFT to get to (6,5) in two moves: from (8,3) to (7,3) then (6,4)? Not direct.\n\nFrom (8,3) to (6,5): delta x -2, delta y +2, so at least two moves, e.g., (7,4) then (6,5).\n\nBut I am at (4,3), to (6,5) is +2 x, +2 y, also two moves.\n\nBut why go there when I have apples right next to me.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is similar.\n\nSo best to eat the nearby apples.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThen next turn, if possible, move DOWN to (3,2) to eat that apple too.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nFor now, move LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the board.\n\nAfter last move: I moved LEFT to (4,3), ate apple, so now head (4,3), body (5,3).\n\nApples: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 all present except (4,3) gone.\n\nEnemy at (8,3).\n\nNo other snakes.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (3,3) is clear.\n\nI think that's the best move.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple there. This grows my snake and gains a point. The enemy snake is far away at (8,3), so this move is safe. Next turn, I can consider moving DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple if possible.\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

I'm at (8, 4) and I need to plan my next move carefully.\n\nMy current strategy is to move up and see if I can position myself to grab an apple. I remember that I don't want to move left or right, as that would put me in danger of colliding with either the wall or Snake #1.\n\nAs I think about moving up, I'm weighing the pros and cons. On the one hand, I'm not sure what's up there, but I'm hoping to find an apple or at least a safe place to grow. On the other hand, I'm taking a risk by moving into potentially unknown territory.\n\nMy thought process is something like: \"Okay, I'll just take a step up and see what happens. If I hit a wall or Snake #1, I'll adjust my plan on the fly.\"\n\nThe decision is clear to me now. To summarize my thought process: my goal is to grow and score points, and moving up seems like a good way to achieve that. I'll just have to be cautious and adjust if things don't go as planned.\n\nMy next move: UP.",

Invalid move.\n- UP to (4,4): Empty space (no apple or obstacles).\n- DOWN to (4,2): Empty space (no apple, but (3,2) has an apple adjacent for potential next move).\n\nWhy LEFT is the best immediate move:\n- Eating the apple at (3,3) gains a point and grows my snake to length 3. This makes me stronger for future conflicts.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,3)\u2014far away and not an immediate threat. By moving left, I'm putting more distance between us.\n- After eating (3,3), I can directly access the apple at (3,2) by moving DOWN next turn for another quick point.\n- If I don't take this apple now, the enemy might eventually move toward it or I'd waste turns circling back.\n\nRisks of other moves:\n- UP or DOWN: I don't eat an apple, so I don't grow. My tail (5,3) disappears, leaving me smaller and weaker. Also, I miss the chance to chain apple eats with (3,2).\n- Staying or moving right is suicidal.\n\nLonger-term strategy: After eating (3,3) and potentially (3,2), I should path toward the cluster of apples at (6,5)/(6,6) while monitoring the enemy. The apple at (5,8) is isolated\u2014low priority for now. Enemy has no body, so it's vulnerable; if it makes a mistake, I can corner it later.\n\nFor this turn, LEFT is clearly optimal.

The board shows no obstacles there\u2014it's empty ('.' in the grid row for y=3). Moving left is safe and doesn't hit anything.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): This is my own body segment (the first 'T').

Apple at (3,2) is adjacent but not directly on this path.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving LEFT to (1,3) is safe and positions me to potentially go down to (1,2) or (1,1) toward the apple at (1,0) soon. It also avoids immediate risks.\n- Moving UP to (2,4) or DOWN to (2,2) are also safe but don't gain an apple immediately.

After moving to (1,3), I can move DOWN to (1,2) and then to (1,1) or (1,0) to eat the apple. Eating apples quickly grows my snake, making me more resilient against the enemy later.\n- Alternative: DOWN to (2,2) gets me closer to the apple at (3,2), but I can't eat it this turn. Next turn, from (2,2), I could move RIGHT to (3,2) to eat it. However, LEFT is slightly better because it starts a path to a cluster\u2014after (1,0), I can head toward other apples.\n- Risk of UP: Moves me away from apples, wasting time. I should prioritize apple collection.\n\nLong-term strategy: After eating (1,0), I should target (3,2), then the apples around (6,5) and (6,6).

LEFT to (0,3):\n   - (0,3) is within board (x=0 to 9, y=0 to 9). No snakes or apples there. Safe move.\n   - But it moves me away from nearby apples.

Next turn, I could move right to (2,2) and then to (3,2) to eat it. Also, the apple at (1,0) is directly below me - I could go down to (1,1) and then (1,0) to eat that apple.\n\nComparing the moves:\n- DOWN seems strategically best because it positions me to target two apples: (3,2) and (1,0).

There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (4,3). The enemy snake #0 is at (7,3) with no body either.\n\nI can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see what each move would do:\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). That's an empty space. From (5,4), I can see potential to go towards the apple at (6,5) or (4,3) which is close but already there? Wait, apple at (4,3) is one space away.\n\nCurrent position: (5,3). Apple at (4,3) is directly to the left? X decreases to the left, so from (5,3) to (4,3) is LEFT.\n\nApples: (6,5) is up-right, (3,3) is left, (3,2) is left and down, (1,0) is far left and down, (4,3) is left one step.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to my head? (5,3) to (4,3) is directly left. And there's an apple at (4,3). So if I move LEFT, I go to (4,3) and eat that apple.\n\nBut is that safe? Let me check for collisions.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3), which is to the right. Moving LEFT to (4,3) should be safe because it's away from the enemy.\n\nWhat about other moves:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,3) -> (6,3). That's empty now, but enemy is at (7,3), so if I go right to (6,3), then enemy could move left to (6,3) next turn? No, enemy could move in any direction, but currently at (7,3), it might move left to (6,3) or elsewhere. But if I go to (6,3), and enemy goes to (6,3), I die. But I don't know what the enemy will do. So it's risky to go towards the enemy.\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). Then I'm moving away from the apples except (6,5) which is at (6,5) \u2013 from (5,4) I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5), but that takes two moves. Whereas if I go LEFT now, I eat the apple at (4,3) immediately and grow.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3) -> (5,2). That's towards the apple at (3,2)? (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, but first I go to (5,2), which is empty. Apple at (3,2) is below and left.\n\nBut moving LEFT directly gets me to apple (4,3) and I grow.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is left and up? From (5,3) to (3,3) is two left? X from 5 to 3, y same 3, so two steps left.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer.\n\nNow, is (4,3) occupied? Board shows: at (4,3) it's an apple? Let me see the board state:\n\nRow y=3: ... A A 1 . 0 ... so at x=3,y=3: A (apple), x=4,y=3: A (apple), x=5,y=3: 1 (me), x=6,y=3: . (empty), x=7,y=3: 0 (enemy).\n\nYes, so (4,3) has an apple. So moving LEFT to (4,3) eats it.\n\nNow, after eating, my snake will have a body part at (5,3), and head at (4,3).\n\nEnemy snake at (7,3) with no body, so it might also go for apples.\n\nApples available: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0). (4,3) will be eaten if I go there.\n\n(3,3) is also an apple, but if I go to (4,3), I'm next to (3,3) which is left, so I could go left again to eat it if I want.\n\nBut let's think about safety.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,3) seems safe because:\n\n- No wall: (4,3) is within 0-9.\n\n- No enemy: enemy is at (7,3), far away.\n\n- No self: I have no body, so no collision.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might come towards me, but currently it's not adjacent.\n\nNow, other moves:\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3): That's closer to enemy. If enemy moves left to (6,3), we collide and both die? Or since it's simultaneous, if we both move to same square, both die. So high risk.\n\n- UP to (5,4): Empty, but no immediate apple. Then from there, I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5) to eat that apple in two moves. But apple at (6,5) might be taken by enemy or I might be intercepted.\n\n- DOWN to (5,2): Then I can go left to (4,2) or (3,2) to eat apple at (3,2). But (3,2) is directly left and down from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, or left and down? (3,2) is x=3,y=2, so from (5,2) it's left two, no y change.\n\nBut moving DOWN first to (5,2) doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n\nWhereas LEFT gets me an apple immediately.\n\nAlso, apple at (1,0) is far, not worth going now.\n\nSo LEFT seems best for immediate growth.\n\nBut let's see if there's a trap or something.\n\nEnemy at (7,3) could move left to (6,3), but if I move LEFT to (4,3), I'm safe.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I don't get an apple, so I delay growth.\n\nDOWN to (5,2) is close to apple at (3,2), but still not eating it this turn.\n\nSimilarly, UP to (5,4) not eating apple at (6,5) this turn.\n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT are adjacent to apples? RIGHT to (6,3) is not an apple; apple at (6,5) is up.\n\nFrom (5,3), adjacent positions:\n\n- Left: (4,3) - apple\n\n- Right: (6,3) - empty\n\n- Up: (5,4) - empty\n\n- Down: (5,2) - empty\n\nSo only LEFT gives me an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT.\n\nBut what about the enemy? Could it threaten me?\n\nAfter I move to (4,3), my head is at (4,3), body at (5,3).\n\nEnemy at (7,3): it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf it moves LEFT to (6,3), then it's closer, but not adjacent to me. I'm at (4,3), it at (6,3), so two spaces away.\n\nThen I could move to (3,3) to eat that apple, or to (4,2) or whatever.\n\nNo immediate threat.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN or UP, it goes away.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nIs there any reason not to? For example, if I want to go for multiple apples.\n\nBut eating one apple now is good, and I can plan next.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is right next to where I'll be if I move left, so I could eat that next turn if I want.\n\nWhereas if I go for (6,5), it might take longer.\n\nMoreover, (3,2) is below, etc.\n\nBut immediate gain: LEFT gives me +1 point and growth.\n\nOther moves don't.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nFinally, for next turn, I should remember to consider going for the apple at (3,3) if I move left now.\n\nOr explore other options.\n\nBut for now, move LEFT.",

Apples are at: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (6,6) \u2014 wait, the apples listed are (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (6,6)? But in the board display, I see apples at (6,5), (6,6)? No:\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Row y=5: ... . . . . . . A . . . \u2192 so (6,5) has apple\n- Row y=6: ... . . . . . . A . . . \u2192 (6,6) has apple? But apples listed are (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 that's five apples.\n\nIn the board:\ny=3: ... A A 1 T . . 0 ... \u2192 positions: (3,3) is A, (4,3) is A? No, let's parse:\nThe row for y=3: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think it's:\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: A (apple at (3,3))\nx=4: 1 (my head? But my head is at (4,3), and body at (5,3)? In the snake info, head is (4,3), body: [(5,3)]\n\nIn the board:\n\"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\"\n\nPerhaps the representation: it says \"A 1 T\" \u2014 T? That might be a typo or something. The user said: \"at (4,3) it's '1' for my head, and (5,3) is body? But in the string: \"A 1 T\" \u2014 let's see the columns.\n\nThe board row for y=3: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" and the columns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo: \nx=0: . (but at x=0, it's not shown for y=3, but from context: positions)\nActually, the board is printed with y from top to bottom? No, in the text: \"9 . . .\" down to \"0 . A . ...\"\n\ny=9 at top, y=0 at bottom.\n\nFor y=3 row: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think the dots represent the cells, so let's count the characters.\n\nThe string: \"3 \" + 10 characters? \" . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 that's 10 characters? Let's list:\n\nAfter \"3 \", it's: . (x=0), . (x=1), . (x=2), A (x=3), 1 (x=4), T (x=5), . (x=6), . (x=7), 0 (x=8), . (x=9)\n\nx=0 to x=9 for y=3.\n\nSo:\nx=0: . (empty)\nx=1: . (empty)\nx=2: . (empty)\nx=3: A (apple) \u2014 so (3,3) apple\nx=4: 1 (my head) \u2014 snake 1 head at (4,3)\nx=5: T \u2014 what is T? Body? The user said body at (5,3), so T must represent the body of snake 1.\nx=6: . (empty)\nx=7: . (empty)\nx=8: 0 (enemy snake head at (8,3)? But enemy snake is at (8,3)? User said enemy head at (8,3), not (7,3).\n\nIn the initial description: \"Enemy snakes: Snake #0 - Head: (8,3), Body: none\"\n\nAnd in board: at x=8,y=3: 0, so (8,3)\n\nAlso, apples: at (6,5) and (6,6) from above rows? Let's see:\n\nRow y=5: \"5 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=5: A\n\nRow y=6: \"6 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=6: A\n\nAnd row y=2: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=3,y=2: A\n\nRow y=0: \"0 . A . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=1,y=0: A\n\nSo apples at: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 that matches the list.\n\nNow, my snake: head at (4,3), body at (5,3) \u2014 so one body segment.\n\nLast move I moved LEFT to (4,3)? From last move info, I moved LEFT, but before that my head was at (5,3) with no body? Last move I was at (5,3) head, and I moved LEFT to (4,3), which had an apple, so now I have a body at (5,3).\n\nCurrent state: head at (4,3), body at (5,3). I just ate the apple at (4,3), so now I have a tail.\n\nEnemy snake: head at (8,3), no body.\n\nApples still present: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 but I just ate (4,3), which was one, but it was listed? In the apples list, (4,3) was not listed; listed were (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6). (4,3) was an apple but it was eaten now? In the board, at (4,3) it was my head after move, but before it was apple? Confusion.\n\nInitial apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6)\n\nIn the board before my last move, at (4,3) it was apple? Yes, from last board state.\n\nAfter I moved LEFT to (4,3), I ate that apple, so now (4,3) is my head, and apple at (4,3) is gone.\n\nCurrent apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 but (3,3) is still there, etc.\n\nNo, (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, which is still apple.\n\nIn the current board, (4,3) is my head, so not apple.\n\nApples remain: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNow, possible moves from my head at (4,3):\n\n- LEFT: to (3,3) \u2014 there is an apple there! So I can eat it and grow.\n\n- RIGHT: to (5,3) \u2014 but that's my body at (5,3). If I go there, I collide with myself and die. So not possible.\n\n- UP: to (4,4) \u2014 need to check if empty or what.\n\n- DOWN: to (4,2) \u2014 empty? From board, at (4,2) it should be empty? y=2 row: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" so x=3,y=2 is A, x=4,y=2 is . (empty)\n\nSimilarly, y=4 row: \"4 . . . . . . . . . .\" all empty around that.\n\nNow, enemy snake at (8,3), no body, so it can move freely.\n\nMy possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT to (3,3): that has an apple, so I eat it and grow. Then my head moves to (3,3), body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] \u2014 since I ate, I grow, so tail stays.\n\n2. UP to (4,4): empty, no apple. Then head at (4,4), body follows to (4,3), and tail at (5,3) remains? When I move without eating, the tail moves, so body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] but when I move to (4,4), head to (4,4), body becomes [ (4,3) ] and tail at (5,3) disappears? Standard snake rules: when you don't eat, you move forward, so the tail end moves. Since I have one body segment, moving to (4,4) will leave (5,3) and the body becomes at (4,3), head at (4,4).\n\nCurrent: head (4,3), body (5,3)\n\nAfter move UP to (4,4): head to (4,4), body moves to (4,3). So the tail (5,3) is gone, and I have head at (4,4), body at (4,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat, I grow, so length increases.\n\n3. DOWN to (4,2): empty, no apple. Similar to UP, head to (4,2), body to (4,3), tail (5,3) gone.\n\nNow, RIGHT is invalid since (5,3) is my body.\n\nSo only LEFT, UP, DOWN are possible, but LEFT has an apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) seems very good because I get another apple immediately.\n\nIs it safe?\n\n- Wall: (3,3) is within bounds.\n\n- Self: no, my body is at (5,3) and moving to (4,3) when I move.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (3,3), head at (3,3), body at (4,3), and since I ate, I grow, so tail remains at (5,3)? With growth: when you eat, the head moves to the apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So positions: head at (3,3), body segments: (4,3) and (5,3). So I have length 3 now.\n\nEnemy: at (8,3), far away. It might move towards apples or something.\n\nPossible threats: if enemy moves towards me, but it's 5 spaces away, not immediate.\n\nApples nearby: after eating (3,3), I can go to (3,2) which is apple below, or to (2,3) if empty, etc.\n\n(3,2) is apple at (3,2), which is directly below (3,3).\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN now, I don't get an apple, and I lose the opportunity to eat (3,3) which is adjacent.\n\nFor example, if I move UP to (4,4), then from there, I can go to (4,5) or something, but no apple immediate, and (3,3) is still there but not adjacent to (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (3,3) is left and down, but one step diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't go directly; I need to move to (3,4) first or (4,3) but (4,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving UP, if I go to (4,4), body at (4,3), so (4,3) is body, not free.\n\nThen I can move LEFT to (3,4)? But (3,4) might be empty, but no apple there.\n\nThen from there, I can go DOWN to (3,3) to eat apple, but that takes two moves, and in the meantime, enemy might eat it or something.\n\nSimilarly for DOWN move.\n\nMoreover, by moving LEFT now, I secure the apple quickly.\n\nAlso, with growth, I become longer, which might help in controlling space.\n\nRisk of moving LEFT: only if (3,3) is dangerous, but it has an apple and no obstacle.\n\nEnemy could potentially come, but it's far.\n\nEnemy at (8,3) can move: if it moves LEFT multiple times, it might come to (5,3) or something, but (5,3) is my tail after I move? After I move to (3,3), I have body at (4,3) and (5,3), so (5,3) is my tail.\n\nIf enemy moves left multiple times to (5,3), it might collide if I'm not there, but since it's my tail, if enemy moves to (5,3), it would collide with my body and die, but not affect me directly, as long as I'm not there.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3,2)? I can eat that next turn if I move to (3,3) now.\n\nThen I would have three apples in quick succession if I go (3,3) -> (3,2).\n\nBut first, this turn.\n\nUP or DOWN might be safer in terms of not growing too fast? But growing is good for points.\n\nAvoiding the enemy: enemy is at (8,3), I'm moving left, away, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the apple at (6,6) or (6,5), but they are far, and enemy is closer to them? Enemy at (8,3), (6,5) is at (6,5), which is left and up from enemy.\n\nEnemy could go UP and LEFT to get to (6,5) in two moves: from (8,3) to (7,3) then (6,4)? Not direct.\n\nFrom (8,3) to (6,5): delta x -2, delta y +2, so at least two moves, e.g., (7,4) then (6,5).\n\nBut I am at (4,3), to (6,5) is +2 x, +2 y, also two moves.\n\nBut why go there when I have apples right next to me.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is similar.\n\nSo best to eat the nearby apples.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThen next turn, if possible, move DOWN to (3,2) to eat that apple too.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nFor now, move LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the board.\n\nAfter last move: I moved LEFT to (4,3), ate apple, so now head (4,3), body (5,3).\n\nApples: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 all present except (4,3) gone.\n\nEnemy at (8,3).\n\nNo other snakes.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (3,3) is clear.\n\nI think that's the best move.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple there. This grows my snake and gains a point. The enemy snake is far away at (8,3), so this move is safe. Next turn, I can consider moving DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple if possible.\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

This makes me stronger for future conflicts.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,3)\u2014far away and not an immediate threat. By moving left, I'm putting more distance between us.\n- After eating (3,3), I can directly access the apple at (3,2) by moving DOWN next turn for another quick point.\n- If I don't take this apple now, the enemy might eventually move toward it or I'd waste turns circling back.\n\nRisks of other moves:\n- UP or DOWN: I don't eat an apple, so I don't grow. My tail (5,3) disappears, leaving me smaller and weaker. Also, I miss the chance to chain apple eats with (3,2).\n- Staying or moving right is suicidal.\n\nLonger-term strategy: After eating (3,3) and potentially (3,2), I should path toward the cluster of apples at (6,5)/(6,6) while monitoring the enemy. The apple at (5,8) is isolated\u2014low priority for now. Enemy has no body, so it's vulnerable; if it makes a mistake, I can corner it later.\n\nFor this turn, LEFT is clearly optimal.

A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 'A' at x=1, y=0 is an apple.\n- Other apples: (6,5), (6,6), (5,8) are visible in their respective rows.\n\nMy snake's current position:\n- Head: (2,3)\n- Body: [(3,3), (4,3)] \u2014 so I have a length of 3.\n\nPossible moves from my head (2,3):\n- LEFT to (1,3): This would move to x=1, y=3. The board shows no obstacles there\u2014it's empty ('.' in the grid row for y=3). Moving left is safe and doesn't hit anything.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): This is my own body segment (the first 'T'). If I move here, I collide with myself and die. Invalid move.\n- UP to (2,4): Empty space (no apple or obstacles).\n- DOWN to (2,2): Empty space. Apple at (3,2) is adjacent but not directly on this path.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving LEFT to (1,3) is safe and positions me to potentially go down to (1,2) or (1,1) toward the apple at (1,0) soon. It also avoids immediate risks.\n- Moving UP to (2,4) or DOWN to (2,2) are also safe but don't gain an apple immediately. Down might be better to get closer to the apple at (3,2) next turn.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,5), far away. No threat this turn. It can move, but I don't need to react yet.\n\nBest move: LEFT\n- Why? It's safe, and it opens a path to the apple at (1,0). After moving to (1,3), I can move DOWN to (1,2) and then to (1,1) or (1,0) to eat the apple. Eating apples quickly grows my snake, making me more resilient against the enemy later.\n- Alternative: DOWN to (2,2) gets me closer to the apple at (3,2), but I can't eat it this turn. Next turn, from (2,2), I could move RIGHT to (3,2) to eat it. However, LEFT is slightly better because it starts a path to a cluster\u2014after (1,0), I can head toward other apples.\n- Risk of UP: Moves me away from apples, wasting time. I should prioritize apple collection.\n\nLong-term strategy: After eating (1,0), I should target (3,2), then the apples around (6,5) and (6,6).

Need to check if this is valid.\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - But (2,3) is my own body segment (the first 'T'). If I move there, I collide with myself and die. So this is invalid.\n- UP: (1,4) - Empty space, no obstacles.\n- DOWN: (1,2) - Empty space, no obstacles.\n\nNow, evaluating each valid move:\n\n1. LEFT to (0,3):\n   - (0,3) is within board (x=0 to 9, y=0 to 9). No snakes or apples there. Safe move.\n   - But it moves me away from nearby apples. After this, I could go down to (0,2) or up to (0,4), but I'd be on the edge.\n\n2. UP to (1,4):\n   - Safe, empty cell. From (1,4), I could go up to (1,5) or right/left. Not directly toward any apple, but could be used to reposition.\n\n3. DOWN to (1,2):\n   - Safe, empty cell. This puts me one step closer to the apple at (3,2). Next turn, I could move right to (2,2) and then to (3,2) to eat it. Also, the apple at (1,0) is directly below me - I could go down to (1,1) and then (1,0) to eat that apple.\n\nComparing the moves:\n- DOWN seems strategically best because it positions me to target two apples: (3,2) and (1,0). I can choose based on enemy movement later.\n- LEFT is safe but less productive - it might lead to being cornered.\n- UP moves me away from the concentration of apples at lower y-levels.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,6). It has no body, so it can move freely. It might go for the apples at (6,6), (6,5), or (5,8). Since it's far away, I don't need to react to it immediately. I should focus on growing my snake first.\n\nLong-term strategy:\n- Eat the apple at (1,0) quickly to grow. Then head for (3,2), and later the cluster at (6,5)/(6,6).\n- With my current length of 3, growing will make me harder to kill.\n- Snake #0 is weak with no body - if I grow faster, I can potentially trap it later.\n\nBest move: DOWN\n- It brings me closer to multiple apples.\n- Avoids self-collision (right is blocked).\n- Sets up for efficient apple collection.\n\nI'll go with DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving down to (1,2), I can choose between going right toward (3,2) or down to (1,1) to target (1,0) apple. Monitor enemy movement.\n\nMOVE: DOWN",

Need to check if this is valid.\n- RIGHT: (2,2) - Is this occupied? Board shows '.' at (2,2), so it's empty.\n- UP: (1,3) - This was my previous head position, and now it's part of my body. So moving up to (1,3) would collide with myself.\n- DOWN: (1,1) - Empty space, no obstacles.\n\nNow, evaluating each valid move:\n\n1. LEFT to (0,2):\n   - (0,2) is within board. No snakes or apples there. Safe move.\n   - But it moves me away from the apples at (1,0) and (3,2). After this, I could go down to (0,1) or (0,0), but that might not be efficient.\n\n2. RIGHT to (2,2):\n   - Safe, empty cell. This brings me closer to the apple at (3,2). Next turn, I could move right to (3,2) to eat it.\n   - Also, from (2,2), I could later go down to (2,1) or up to (2,3) - but (2,3) is my body, so up would be blocked after this move.\n\n3. DOWN to (1,1):\n   - Safe, empty cell. This positions me to go directly down to (1,0) to eat the apple there on the next turn.\n   - Eating an apple quickly will make my snake grow.\n\nComparing the moves:\n- RIGHT allows me to target the apple at (3,2) in two moves: (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2)\n- DOWN allows me to target the apple at (1,0) in two moves: (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)\n- LEFT is safe but less productive - no apples in immediate range.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,7). It might be targeting the apples at (6,6), (6,5), or (5,8). Since it's far away, I don't need to worry about it immediately.\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- Eating an apple soon will help me grow. With a longer body, I can block the enemy snake later.\n- The apple at (1,0) is closer in terms of steps (only two moves away via down).\n- The apple at (3,2) is also two moves away via right.\n\nBoth apples are equally reachable. I need to think about positioning after eating.\n\nIf I go for (1,0):\n- After eating at (1,0), I'll be at (1,0) with a new body segment. Then I can head right toward (3,2) or up.\n\nIf I go for (3,2):\n- After eating at (3,2), I'll be at (3,2), and I can continue right or down.\n\nThe board has multiple apples, so I shouldn't hesitate too much.\n\nSafety check:\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,2) is safe - no enemy or walls.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,1) is safe.\n- Moving UP would kill me because my own body is at (1,3).\n- LEFT is safe but inefficient.\n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better because:\n- The apple at (3,2) is in the middle, so after eating it, I can easily go to other apples like (6,5) or (6,6).\n- Going to (1,0) is at the edge, which might limit my options temporarily.\n\nSo, I'll choose RIGHT to (2,2) to target the (3,2) apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember to go to (3,2) to eat the apple, unless something changes.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI need to maximize my growth by targeting the nearest apple. From my current position at (1,2), moving RIGHT to (2,2) positions me to eat the apple at (3,2) on the next turn. This is more efficient than moving DOWN toward (1,0) because (3,2) is centrally located, allowing better access to other apples afterward. Moving UP is suicidal due to my body segment at (1,3), and moving LEFT is safe but wastes time. Enemy snake #0 at (8,7) is distant and poses no immediate threat. Strategy for next turn: Move to (3,2) to eat the apple unless enemy movement changes the situation.\n\nMOVE: RIGHT",

            "rationale": "<think> I will not include any thinking in the response part.\n\nFirst, I see the board. My snake is at (5,3) with no body, so just a head. There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (4,3). The enemy snake #0 is at (7,3) with no body either.\n\nI can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see what each move would do:\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). That's an empty space. From (5,4), I can see potential to go towards the apple at (6,5) or (4,3) which is close but already there? Wait, apple at (4,3) is one space away.\n\nCurrent position: (5,3). Apple at (4,3) is directly to the left? X decreases to the left, so from (5,3) to (4,3) is LEFT.\n\nApples: (6,5) is up-right, (3,3) is left, (3,2) is left and down, (1,0) is far left and down, (4,3) is left one step.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to my head? (5,3) to (4,3) is directly left. And there's an apple at (4,3). So if I move LEFT, I go to (4,3) and eat that apple.\n\nBut is that safe? Let me check for collisions.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3), which is to the right. Moving LEFT to (4,3) should be safe because it's away from the enemy.\n\nWhat about other moves:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,3) -> (6,3). That's empty now, but enemy is at (7,3), so if I go right to (6,3), then enemy could move left to (6,3) next turn? No, enemy could move in any direction, but currently at (7,3), it might move left to (6,3) or elsewhere. But if I go to (6,3), and enemy goes to (6,3), I die. But I don't know what the enemy will do. So it's risky to go towards the enemy.\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). Then I'm moving away from the apples except (6,5) which is at (6,5) \u2013 from (5,4) I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5), but that takes two moves. Whereas if I go LEFT now, I eat the apple at (4,3) immediately and grow.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3) -> (5,2). That's towards the apple at (3,2)? (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, but first I go to (5,2), which is empty. Apple at (3,2) is below and left.\n\nBut moving LEFT directly gets me to apple (4,3) and I grow.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is left and up? From (5,3) to (3,3) is two left? X from 5 to 3, y same 3, so two steps left.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer.\n\nNow, is (4,3) occupied? Board shows: at (4,3) it's an apple? Let me see the board state:\n\nRow y=3: ... A A 1 . 0 ... so at x=3,y=3: A (apple), x=4,y=3: A (apple), x=5,y=3: 1 (me), x=6,y=3: . (empty), x=7,y=3: 0 (enemy).\n\nYes, so (4,3) has an apple. So moving LEFT to (4,3) eats it.\n\nNow, after eating, my snake will have a body part at (5,3), and head at (4,3).\n\nEnemy snake at (7,3) with no body, so it might also go for apples.\n\nApples available: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0). (4,3) will be eaten if I go there.\n\n(3,3) is also an apple, but if I go to (4,3), I'm next to (3,3) which is left, so I could go left again to eat it if I want.\n\nBut let's think about safety.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,3) seems safe because:\n\n- No wall: (4,3) is within 0-9.\n\n- No enemy: enemy is at (7,3), far away.\n\n- No self: I have no body, so no collision.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might come towards me, but currently it's not adjacent.\n\nNow, other moves:\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3): That's closer to enemy. If enemy moves left to (6,3), we collide and both die? Or since it's simultaneous, if we both move to same square, both die. So high risk.\n\n- UP to (5,4): Empty, but no immediate apple. Then from there, I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5) to eat that apple in two moves. But apple at (6,5) might be taken by enemy or I might be intercepted.\n\n- DOWN to (5,2): Then I can go left to (4,2) or (3,2) to eat apple at (3,2). But (3,2) is directly left and down from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, or left and down? (3,2) is x=3,y=2, so from (5,2) it's left two, no y change.\n\nBut moving DOWN first to (5,2) doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n\nWhereas LEFT gets me an apple immediately.\n\nAlso, apple at (1,0) is far, not worth going now.\n\nSo LEFT seems best for immediate growth.\n\nBut let's see if there's a trap or something.\n\nEnemy at (7,3) could move left to (6,3), but if I move LEFT to (4,3), I'm safe.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I don't get an apple, so I delay growth.\n\nDOWN to (5,2) is close to apple at (3,2), but still not eating it this turn.\n\nSimilarly, UP to (5,4) not eating apple at (6,5) this turn.\n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT are adjacent to apples? RIGHT to (6,3) is not an apple; apple at (6,5) is up.\n\nFrom (5,3), adjacent positions:\n\n- Left: (4,3) - apple\n\n- Right: (6,3) - empty\n\n- Up: (5,4) - empty\n\n- Down: (5,2) - empty\n\nSo only LEFT gives me an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT.\n\nBut what about the enemy? Could it threaten me?\n\nAfter I move to (4,3), my head is at (4,3), body at (5,3).\n\nEnemy at (7,3): it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf it moves LEFT to (6,3), then it's closer, but not adjacent to me. I'm at (4,3), it at (6,3), so two spaces away.\n\nThen I could move to (3,3) to eat that apple, or to (4,2) or whatever.\n\nNo immediate threat.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN or UP, it goes away.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nIs there any reason not to? For example, if I want to go for multiple apples.\n\nBut eating one apple now is good, and I can plan next.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is right next to where I'll be if I move left, so I could eat that next turn if I want.\n\nWhereas if I go for (6,5), it might take longer.\n\nMoreover, (3,2) is below, etc.\n\nBut immediate gain: LEFT gives me +1 point and growth.\n\nOther moves don't.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nFinally, for next turn, I should remember to consider going for the apple at (3,3) if I move left now.\n\nOr explore other options.\n\nBut for now, move LEFT.",

User said enemy head at (8,3), not (7,3).\n\nIn the initial description: \"Enemy snakes: Snake #0 - Head: (8,3), Body: none\"\n\nAnd in board: at x=8,y=3: 0, so (8,3)\n\nAlso, apples: at (6,5) and (6,6) from above rows? Let's see:\n\nRow y=5: \"5 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=5: A\n\nRow y=6: \"6 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=6: A\n\nAnd row y=2: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=3,y=2: A\n\nRow y=0: \"0 . A . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=1,y=0: A\n\nSo apples at: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 that matches the list.\n\nNow, my snake: head at (4,3), body at (5,3) \u2014 so one body segment.\n\nLast move I moved LEFT to (4,3)? From last move info, I moved LEFT, but before that my head was at (5,3) with no body? Last move I was at (5,3) head, and I moved LEFT to (4,3), which had an apple, so now I have a body at (5,3).\n\nCurrent state: head at (4,3), body at (5,3). I just ate the apple at (4,3), so now I have a tail.\n\nEnemy snake: head at (8,3), no body.\n\nApples still present: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 but I just ate (4,3), which was one, but it was listed? In the apples list, (4,3) was not listed; listed were (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6). (4,3) was an apple but it was eaten now? In the board, at (4,3) it was my head after move, but before it was apple? Confusion.\n\nInitial apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6)\n\nIn the board before my last move, at (4,3) it was apple? Yes, from last board state.\n\nAfter I moved LEFT to (4,3), I ate that apple, so now (4,3) is my head, and apple at (4,3) is gone.\n\nCurrent apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 but (3,3) is still there, etc.\n\nNo, (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, which is still apple.\n\nIn the current board, (4,3) is my head, so not apple.\n\nApples remain: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNow, possible moves from my head at (4,3):\n\n- LEFT: to (3,3) \u2014 there is an apple there! So I can eat it and grow.\n\n- RIGHT: to (5,3) \u2014 but that's my body at (5,3). If I go there, I collide with myself and die. So not possible.\n\n- UP: to (4,4) \u2014 need to check if empty or what.\n\n- DOWN: to (4,2) \u2014 empty? From board, at (4,2) it should be empty? y=2 row: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" so x=3,y=2 is A, x=4,y=2 is . (empty)\n\nSimilarly, y=4 row: \"4 . . . . . . . . . .\" all empty around that.\n\nNow, enemy snake at (8,3), no body, so it can move freely.\n\nMy possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT to (3,3): that has an apple, so I eat it and grow. Then my head moves to (3,3), body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] \u2014 since I ate, I grow, so tail stays.\n\n2. UP to (4,4): empty, no apple. Then head at (4,4), body follows to (4,3), and tail at (5,3) remains? When I move without eating, the tail moves, so body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] but when I move to (4,4), head to (4,4), body becomes [ (4,3) ] and tail at (5,3) disappears? Standard snake rules: when you don't eat, you move forward, so the tail end moves. Since I have one body segment, moving to (4,4) will leave (5,3) and the body becomes at (4,3), head at (4,4).\n\nCurrent: head (4,3), body (5,3)\n\nAfter move UP to (4,4): head to (4,4), body moves to (4,3). So the tail (5,3) is gone, and I have head at (4,4), body at (4,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat, I grow, so length increases.\n\n3. DOWN to (4,2): empty, no apple. Similar to UP, head to (4,2), body to (4,3), tail (5,3) gone.\n\nNow, RIGHT is invalid since (5,3) is my body.\n\nSo only LEFT, UP, DOWN are possible, but LEFT has an apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) seems very good because I get another apple immediately.\n\nIs it safe?\n\n- Wall: (3,3) is within bounds.\n\n- Self: no, my body is at (5,3) and moving to (4,3) when I move.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (3,3), head at (3,3), body at (4,3), and since I ate, I grow, so tail remains at (5,3)? With growth: when you eat, the head moves to the apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So positions: head at (3,3), body segments: (4,3) and (5,3). So I have length 3 now.\n\nEnemy: at (8,3), far away. It might move towards apples or something.\n\nPossible threats: if enemy moves towards me, but it's 5 spaces away, not immediate.\n\nApples nearby: after eating (3,3), I can go to (3,2) which is apple below, or to (2,3) if empty, etc.\n\n(3,2) is apple at (3,2), which is directly below (3,3).\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN now, I don't get an apple, and I lose the opportunity to eat (3,3) which is adjacent.\n\nFor example, if I move UP to (4,4), then from there, I can go to (4,5) or something, but no apple immediate, and (3,3) is still there but not adjacent to (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (3,3) is left and down, but one step diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't go directly; I need to move to (3,4) first or (4,3) but (4,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving UP, if I go to (4,4), body at (4,3), so (4,3) is body, not free.\n\nThen I can move LEFT to (3,4)? But (3,4) might be empty, but no apple there.\n\nThen from there, I can go DOWN to (3,3) to eat apple, but that takes two moves, and in the meantime, enemy might eat it or something.\n\nSimilarly for DOWN move.\n\nMoreover, by moving LEFT now, I secure the apple quickly.\n\nAlso, with growth, I become longer, which might help in controlling space.\n\nRisk of moving LEFT: only if (3,3) is dangerous, but it has an apple and no obstacle.\n\nEnemy could potentially come, but it's far.\n\nEnemy at (8,3) can move: if it moves LEFT multiple times, it might come to (5,3) or something, but (5,3) is my tail after I move? After I move to (3,3), I have body at (4,3) and (5,3), so (5,3) is my tail.\n\nIf enemy moves left multiple times to (5,3), it might collide if I'm not there, but since it's my tail, if enemy moves to (5,3), it would collide with my body and die, but not affect me directly, as long as I'm not there.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3,2)? I can eat that next turn if I move to (3,3) now.\n\nThen I would have three apples in quick succession if I go (3,3) -> (3,2).\n\nBut first, this turn.\n\nUP or DOWN might be safer in terms of not growing too fast? But growing is good for points.\n\nAvoiding the enemy: enemy is at (8,3), I'm moving left, away, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the apple at (6,6) or (6,5), but they are far, and enemy is closer to them? Enemy at (8,3), (6,5) is at (6,5), which is left and up from enemy.\n\nEnemy could go UP and LEFT to get to (6,5) in two moves: from (8,3) to (7,3) then (6,4)? Not direct.\n\nFrom (8,3) to (6,5): delta x -2, delta y +2, so at least two moves, e.g., (7,4) then (6,5).\n\nBut I am at (4,3), to (6,5) is +2 x, +2 y, also two moves.\n\nBut why go there when I have apples right next to me.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is similar.\n\nSo best to eat the nearby apples.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThen next turn, if possible, move DOWN to (3,2) to eat that apple too.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nFor now, move LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the board.\n\nAfter last move: I moved LEFT to (4,3), ate apple, so now head (4,3), body (5,3).\n\nApples: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 all present except (4,3) gone.\n\nEnemy at (8,3).\n\nNo other snakes.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (3,3) is clear.\n\nI think that's the best move.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple there. This grows my snake and gains a point. The enemy snake is far away at (8,3), so this move is safe. Next turn, I can consider moving DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple if possible.\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

This makes me stronger for future conflicts.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,3)\u2014far away and not an immediate threat. By moving left, I'm putting more distance between us.\n- After eating (3,3), I can directly access the apple at (3,2) by moving DOWN next turn for another quick point.\n- If I don't take this apple now, the enemy might eventually move toward it or I'd waste turns circling back.\n\nRisks of other moves:\n- UP or DOWN: I don't eat an apple, so I don't grow. My tail (5,3) disappears, leaving me smaller and weaker. Also, I miss the chance to chain apple eats with (3,2).\n- Staying or moving right is suicidal.\n\nLonger-term strategy: After eating (3,3) and potentially (3,2), I should path toward the cluster of apples at (6,5)/(6,6) while monitoring the enemy. The apple at (5,8) is isolated\u2014low priority for now. Enemy has no body, so it's vulnerable; if it makes a mistake, I can corner it later.\n\nFor this turn, LEFT is clearly optimal.

The board shows no obstacles there\u2014it's empty ('.' in the grid row for y=3). Moving left is safe and doesn't hit anything.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): This is my own body segment (the first 'T').

Apple at (3,2) is adjacent but not directly on this path.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving LEFT to (1,3) is safe and positions me to potentially go down to (1,2) or (1,1) toward the apple at (1,0) soon. It also avoids immediate risks.\n- Moving UP to (2,4) or DOWN to (2,2) are also safe but don't gain an apple immediately.

After moving to (1,3), I can move DOWN to (1,2) and then to (1,1) or (1,0) to eat the apple. Eating apples quickly grows my snake, making me more resilient against the enemy later.\n- Alternative: DOWN to (2,2) gets me closer to the apple at (3,2), but I can't eat it this turn. Next turn, from (2,2), I could move RIGHT to (3,2) to eat it. However, LEFT is slightly better because it starts a path to a cluster\u2014after (1,0), I can head toward other apples.\n- Risk of UP: Moves me away from apples, wasting time.

If that works, I'll try to move down to (7, 6) and capture the apple in the next move.\n\nBut for now, let's just move up and see where it takes us.\n\nUP",

Need to check if this is valid.\n- RIGHT: (2,2) - Is this occupied? Board shows '.' at (2,2), so it's empty.\n- UP: (1,3) - This was my previous head position, and now it's part of my body. So moving up to (1,3) would collide with myself.\n- DOWN: (1,1) - Empty space, no obstacles.\n\nNow, evaluating each valid move:\n\n1. LEFT to (0,2):\n   - (0,2) is within board. No snakes or apples there. Safe move.\n   - But it moves me away from the apples at (1,0) and (3,2). After this, I could go down to (0,1) or (0,0), but that might not be efficient.\n\n2. RIGHT to (2,2):\n   - Safe, empty cell. This brings me closer to the apple at (3,2). Next turn, I could move right to (3,2) to eat it.\n   - Also, from (2,2), I could later go down to (2,1) or up to (2,3) - but (2,3) is my body, so up would be blocked after this move.\n\n3. DOWN to (1,1):\n   - Safe, empty cell. This positions me to go directly down to (1,0) to eat the apple there on the next turn.\n   - Eating an apple quickly will make my snake grow.\n\nComparing the moves:\n- RIGHT allows me to target the apple at (3,2) in two moves: (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2)\n- DOWN allows me to target the apple at (1,0) in two moves: (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)\n- LEFT is safe but less productive - no apples in immediate range.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,7). It might be targeting the apples at (6,6), (6,5), or (5,8). Since it's far away, I don't need to worry about it immediately.\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- Eating an apple soon will help me grow. With a longer body, I can block the enemy snake later.\n- The apple at (1,0) is closer in terms of steps (only two moves away via down).\n- The apple at (3,2) is also two moves away via right.\n\nBoth apples are equally reachable. I need to think about positioning after eating.\n\nIf I go for (1,0):\n- After eating at (1,0), I'll be at (1,0) with a new body segment. Then I can head right toward (3,2) or up.\n\nIf I go for (3,2):\n- After eating at (3,2), I'll be at (3,2), and I can continue right or down.\n\nThe board has multiple apples, so I shouldn't hesitate too much.\n\nSafety check:\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,2) is safe - no enemy or walls.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,1) is safe.\n- Moving UP would kill me because my own body is at (1,3).\n- LEFT is safe but inefficient.\n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better because:\n- The apple at (3,2) is in the middle, so after eating it, I can easily go to other apples like (6,5) or (6,6).\n- Going to (1,0) is at the edge, which might limit my options temporarily.\n\nSo, I'll choose RIGHT to (2,2) to target the (3,2) apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember to go to (3,2) to eat the apple, unless something changes.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI need to maximize my growth by targeting the nearest apple. From my current position at (1,2), moving RIGHT to (2,2) positions me to eat the apple at (3,2) on the next turn. This is more efficient than moving DOWN toward (1,0) because (3,2) is centrally located, allowing better access to other apples afterward. Moving UP is suicidal due to my body segment at (1,3), and moving LEFT is safe but wastes time. Enemy snake #0 at (8,7) is distant and poses no immediate threat. Strategy for next turn: Move to (3,2) to eat the apple unless enemy movement changes the situation.\n\nMOVE: RIGHT",

So:\n  - (1,2) is my first body segment (since I just moved from there to (2,2))\n  - (1,3) is my second body segment (tail)\n\nNow, my head is at (2,2). Possible moves:\n\n- LEFT: to (1,2) - but this is occupied by my own body segment. Collision! Dead if I go there.\n- RIGHT: to (3,2) - this is the apple! I can eat it and grow.\n- UP: to (2,3) - empty space? Board shows nothing at (2,3). In the visualization, row 3 has (1,3) as T, but (2,3) should be empty since it's not marked.\n- DOWN: to (2,1) - empty space? Yes, board shows nothing at (2,1).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,8). It has no body, so it might move to an apple or away. Currently not a threat to me since it's far.\n\nEvaluating moves:\n\n1. RIGHT to (3,2): \n   - This is an apple! I eat it, grow by one segment, and gain a point. \n   - After eating, my head will be at (3,2), and my body becomes [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3)] - so I'll have three body segments. \n   - This is highly beneficial and directly achieves my goal.\n\n2. UP to (2,3):\n   - Safe move, empty space. \n   - From there, I could go up to (2,4) or right to (3,3), but it doesn't get me an apple immediately. \n   - Less efficient since I'm passing up a free apple.\n\n3. DOWN to (2,1):\n   - Safe move, empty space. \n   - Then I could go down to (2,0) or left/right, but there's an apple at (1,0) which I could target later. \n   - However, RIGHT gives me an apple now.\n\nWhat about other moves? LEFT is impossible (death), so only RIGHT, UP, DOWN are possible. \n\nRIGHT is clearly the best because:\n- It consumes an apple, growing me immediately.\n- It positions me well: at (3,2), I can easily access other apples like (6,5) or (6,6) by moving right/down in future turns.\n- The apple at (3,2) is right next to me\u2014only one step away. Why delay?\n\nNo risks: \n- Enemy snake is far away at (8,8). \n- Moving RIGHT doesn't run into any obstacles since (3,2) is an apple, not a snake or wall.\n\nStrategy after this:\n- After eating the apple at (3,2), my next move should be to continue toward other apples. \n- Options: \n  - RIGHT to (4,2) to head toward apples at (6,5)/(6,6), but that's a long path. \n  - DOWN to (3,1) to eventually target (1,0) apple. \n  - UP to (3,3) to open space. \n- I'll decide next turn based on enemy positions.\n\nFor now, RIGHT is the optimal move.\n\n</think>\n\nRIGHT",

There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (4,3). The enemy snake #0 is at (7,3) with no body either.\n\nI can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see what each move would do:\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). That's an empty space. From (5,4), I can see potential to go towards the apple at (6,5) or (4,3) which is close but already there? Wait, apple at (4,3) is one space away.\n\nCurrent position: (5,3). Apple at (4,3) is directly to the left? X decreases to the left, so from (5,3) to (4,3) is LEFT.\n\nApples: (6,5) is up-right, (3,3) is left, (3,2) is left and down, (1,0) is far left and down, (4,3) is left one step.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to my head? (5,3) to (4,3) is directly left. And there's an apple at (4,3). So if I move LEFT, I go to (4,3) and eat that apple.\n\nBut is that safe? Let me check for collisions.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3), which is to the right. Moving LEFT to (4,3) should be safe because it's away from the enemy.\n\nWhat about other moves:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,3) -> (6,3). That's empty now, but enemy is at (7,3), so if I go right to (6,3), then enemy could move left to (6,3) next turn? No, enemy could move in any direction, but currently at (7,3), it might move left to (6,3) or elsewhere. But if I go to (6,3), and enemy goes to (6,3), I die. But I don't know what the enemy will do. So it's risky to go towards the enemy.\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). Then I'm moving away from the apples except (6,5) which is at (6,5) \u2013 from (5,4) I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5), but that takes two moves. Whereas if I go LEFT now, I eat the apple at (4,3) immediately and grow.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3) -> (5,2). That's towards the apple at (3,2)? (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, but first I go to (5,2), which is empty. Apple at (3,2) is below and left.\n\nBut moving LEFT directly gets me to apple (4,3) and I grow.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is left and up? From (5,3) to (3,3) is two left? X from 5 to 3, y same 3, so two steps left.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer.\n\nNow, is (4,3) occupied? Board shows: at (4,3) it's an apple? Let me see the board state:\n\nRow y=3: ... A A 1 . 0 ... so at x=3,y=3: A (apple), x=4,y=3: A (apple), x=5,y=3: 1 (me), x=6,y=3: . (empty), x=7,y=3: 0 (enemy).\n\nYes, so (4,3) has an apple. So moving LEFT to (4,3) eats it.\n\nNow, after eating, my snake will have a body part at (5,3), and head at (4,3).\n\nEnemy snake at (7,3) with no body, so it might also go for apples.\n\nApples available: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0). (4,3) will be eaten if I go there.\n\n(3,3) is also an apple, but if I go to (4,3), I'm next to (3,3) which is left, so I could go left again to eat it if I want.\n\nBut let's think about safety.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,3) seems safe because:\n\n- No wall: (4,3) is within 0-9.\n\n- No enemy: enemy is at (7,3), far away.\n\n- No self: I have no body, so no collision.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might come towards me, but currently it's not adjacent.\n\nNow, other moves:\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3): That's closer to enemy. If enemy moves left to (6,3), we collide and both die? Or since it's simultaneous, if we both move to same square, both die. So high risk.\n\n- UP to (5,4): Empty, but no immediate apple. Then from there, I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5) to eat that apple in two moves. But apple at (6,5) might be taken by enemy or I might be intercepted.\n\n- DOWN to (5,2): Then I can go left to (4,2) or (3,2) to eat apple at (3,2). But (3,2) is directly left and down from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, or left and down? (3,2) is x=3,y=2, so from (5,2) it's left two, no y change.\n\nBut moving DOWN first to (5,2) doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n\nWhereas LEFT gets me an apple immediately.\n\nAlso, apple at (1,0) is far, not worth going now.\n\nSo LEFT seems best for immediate growth.\n\nBut let's see if there's a trap or something.\n\nEnemy at (7,3) could move left to (6,3), but if I move LEFT to (4,3), I'm safe.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I don't get an apple, so I delay growth.\n\nDOWN to (5,2) is close to apple at (3,2), but still not eating it this turn.\n\nSimilarly, UP to (5,4) not eating apple at (6,5) this turn.\n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT are adjacent to apples? RIGHT to (6,3) is not an apple; apple at (6,5) is up.\n\nFrom (5,3), adjacent positions:\n\n- Left: (4,3) - apple\n\n- Right: (6,3) - empty\n\n- Up: (5,4) - empty\n\n- Down: (5,2) - empty\n\nSo only LEFT gives me an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT.\n\nBut what about the enemy? Could it threaten me?\n\nAfter I move to (4,3), my head is at (4,3), body at (5,3).\n\nEnemy at (7,3): it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf it moves LEFT to (6,3), then it's closer, but not adjacent to me. I'm at (4,3), it at (6,3), so two spaces away.\n\nThen I could move to (3,3) to eat that apple, or to (4,2) or whatever.\n\nNo immediate threat.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN or UP, it goes away.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nIs there any reason not to? For example, if I want to go for multiple apples.\n\nBut eating one apple now is good, and I can plan next.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is right next to where I'll be if I move left, so I could eat that next turn if I want.\n\nWhereas if I go for (6,5), it might take longer.\n\nMoreover, (3,2) is below, etc.\n\nBut immediate gain: LEFT gives me +1 point and growth.\n\nOther moves don't.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nFinally, for next turn, I should remember to consider going for the apple at (3,3) if I move left now.\n\nOr explore other options.\n\nBut for now, move LEFT.",

But apples listed are (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 that's five apples.\n\nIn the board:\ny=3: ... A A 1 T . . 0 ... \u2192 positions: (3,3) is A, (4,3) is A? No, let's parse:\nThe row for y=3: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think it's:\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: A (apple at (3,3))\nx=4: 1 (my head? But my head is at (4,3), and body at (5,3)? In the snake info, head is (4,3), body: [(5,3)]\n\nIn the board:\n\"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\"\n\nPerhaps the representation: it says \"A 1 T\" \u2014 T? That might be a typo or something. The user said: \"at (4,3) it's '1' for my head, and (5,3) is body? But in the string: \"A 1 T\" \u2014 let's see the columns.\n\nThe board row for y=3: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" and the columns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo: \nx=0: . (but at x=0, it's not shown for y=3, but from context: positions)\nActually, the board is printed with y from top to bottom? No, in the text: \"9 . . .\" down to \"0 . A . ...\"\n\ny=9 at top, y=0 at bottom.\n\nFor y=3 row: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think the dots represent the cells, so let's count the characters.\n\nThe string: \"3 \" + 10 characters? \" . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 that's 10 characters? Let's list:\n\nAfter \"3 \", it's: . (x=0), . (x=1), . (x=2), A (x=3), 1 (x=4), T (x=5), . (x=6), . (x=7), 0 (x=8), . (x=9)\n\nx=0 to x=9 for y=3.\n\nSo:\nx=0: . (empty)\nx=1: . (empty)\nx=2: . (empty)\nx=3: A (apple) \u2014 so (3,3) apple\nx=4: 1 (my head) \u2014 snake 1 head at (4,3)\nx=5: T \u2014 what is T? Body? The user said body at (5,3), so T must represent the body of snake 1.\nx=6: . (empty)\nx=7: . (empty)\nx=8: 0 (enemy snake head at (8,3)? But enemy snake is at (8,3)? User said enemy head at (8,3), not (7,3).\n\nIn the initial description: \"Enemy snakes: Snake #0 - Head: (8,3), Body: none\"\n\nAnd in board: at x=8,y=3: 0, so (8,3)\n\nAlso, apples: at (6,5) and (6,6) from above rows? Let's see:\n\nRow y=5: \"5 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=5: A\n\nRow y=6: \"6 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=6: A\n\nAnd row y=2: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=3,y=2: A\n\nRow y=0: \"0 . A . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=1,y=0: A\n\nSo apples at: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 that matches the list.\n\nNow, my snake: head at (4,3), body at (5,3) \u2014 so one body segment.\n\nLast move I moved LEFT to (4,3)? From last move info, I moved LEFT, but before that my head was at (5,3) with no body? Last move I was at (5,3) head, and I moved LEFT to (4,3), which had an apple, so now I have a body at (5,3).\n\nCurrent state: head at (4,3), body at (5,3). I just ate the apple at (4,3), so now I have a tail.\n\nEnemy snake: head at (8,3), no body.\n\nApples still present: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 but I just ate (4,3), which was one, but it was listed? In the apples list, (4,3) was not listed; listed were (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6). (4,3) was an apple but it was eaten now? In the board, at (4,3) it was my head after move, but before it was apple? Confusion.\n\nInitial apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6)\n\nIn the board before my last move, at (4,3) it was apple? Yes, from last board state.\n\nAfter I moved LEFT to (4,3), I ate that apple, so now (4,3) is my head, and apple at (4,3) is gone.\n\nCurrent apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 but (3,3) is still there, etc.\n\nNo, (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, which is still apple.\n\nIn the current board, (4,3) is my head, so not apple.\n\nApples remain: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNow, possible moves from my head at (4,3):\n\n- LEFT: to (3,3) \u2014 there is an apple there! So I can eat it and grow.\n\n- RIGHT: to (5,3) \u2014 but that's my body at (5,3). If I go there, I collide with myself and die. So not possible.\n\n- UP: to (4,4) \u2014 need to check if empty or what.\n\n- DOWN: to (4,2) \u2014 empty? From board, at (4,2) it should be empty? y=2 row: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" so x=3,y=2 is A, x=4,y=2 is . (empty)\n\nSimilarly, y=4 row: \"4 . . . . . . . . . .\" all empty around that.\n\nNow, enemy snake at (8,3), no body, so it can move freely.\n\nMy possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT to (3,3): that has an apple, so I eat it and grow. Then my head moves to (3,3), body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] \u2014 since I ate, I grow, so tail stays.\n\n2. UP to (4,4): empty, no apple. Then head at (4,4), body follows to (4,3), and tail at (5,3) remains? When I move without eating, the tail moves, so body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] but when I move to (4,4), head to (4,4), body becomes [ (4,3) ] and tail at (5,3) disappears? Standard snake rules: when you don't eat, you move forward, so the tail end moves. Since I have one body segment, moving to (4,4) will leave (5,3) and the body becomes at (4,3), head at (4,4).\n\nCurrent: head (4,3), body (5,3)\n\nAfter move UP to (4,4): head to (4,4), body moves to (4,3). So the tail (5,3) is gone, and I have head at (4,4), body at (4,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat, I grow, so length increases.\n\n3. DOWN to (4,2): empty, no apple. Similar to UP, head to (4,2), body to (4,3), tail (5,3) gone.\n\nNow, RIGHT is invalid since (5,3) is my body.\n\nSo only LEFT, UP, DOWN are possible, but LEFT has an apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) seems very good because I get another apple immediately.\n\nIs it safe?\n\n- Wall: (3,3) is within bounds.\n\n- Self: no, my body is at (5,3) and moving to (4,3) when I move.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (3,3), head at (3,3), body at (4,3), and since I ate, I grow, so tail remains at (5,3)? With growth: when you eat, the head moves to the apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So positions: head at (3,3), body segments: (4,3) and (5,3). So I have length 3 now.\n\nEnemy: at (8,3), far away. It might move towards apples or something.\n\nPossible threats: if enemy moves towards me, but it's 5 spaces away, not immediate.\n\nApples nearby: after eating (3,3), I can go to (3,2) which is apple below, or to (2,3) if empty, etc.\n\n(3,2) is apple at (3,2), which is directly below (3,3).\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN now, I don't get an apple, and I lose the opportunity to eat (3,3) which is adjacent.\n\nFor example, if I move UP to (4,4), then from there, I can go to (4,5) or something, but no apple immediate, and (3,3) is still there but not adjacent to (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (3,3) is left and down, but one step diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't go directly; I need to move to (3,4) first or (4,3) but (4,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving UP, if I go to (4,4), body at (4,3), so (4,3) is body, not free.\n\nThen I can move LEFT to (3,4)? But (3,4) might be empty, but no apple there.\n\nThen from there, I can go DOWN to (3,3) to eat apple, but that takes two moves, and in the meantime, enemy might eat it or something.\n\nSimilarly for DOWN move.\n\nMoreover, by moving LEFT now, I secure the apple quickly.\n\nAlso, with growth, I become longer, which might help in controlling space.\n\nRisk of moving LEFT: only if (3,3) is dangerous, but it has an apple and no obstacle.\n\nEnemy could potentially come, but it's far.\n\nEnemy at (8,3) can move: if it moves LEFT multiple times, it might come to (5,3) or something, but (5,3) is my tail after I move? After I move to (3,3), I have body at (4,3) and (5,3), so (5,3) is my tail.\n\nIf enemy moves left multiple times to (5,3), it might collide if I'm not there, but since it's my tail, if enemy moves to (5,3), it would collide with my body and die, but not affect me directly, as long as I'm not there.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3,2)? I can eat that next turn if I move to (3,3) now.\n\nThen I would have three apples in quick succession if I go (3,3) -> (3,2).\n\nBut first, this turn.\n\nUP or DOWN might be safer in terms of not growing too fast? But growing is good for points.\n\nAvoiding the enemy: enemy is at (8,3), I'm moving left, away, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the apple at (6,6) or (6,5), but they are far, and enemy is closer to them? Enemy at (8,3), (6,5) is at (6,5), which is left and up from enemy.\n\nEnemy could go UP and LEFT to get to (6,5) in two moves: from (8,3) to (7,3) then (6,4)? Not direct.\n\nFrom (8,3) to (6,5): delta x -2, delta y +2, so at least two moves, e.g., (7,4) then (6,5).\n\nBut I am at (4,3), to (6,5) is +2 x, +2 y, also two moves.\n\nBut why go there when I have apples right next to me.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is similar.\n\nSo best to eat the nearby apples.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThen next turn, if possible, move DOWN to (3,2) to eat that apple too.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nFor now, move LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the board.\n\nAfter last move: I moved LEFT to (4,3), ate apple, so now head (4,3), body (5,3).\n\nApples: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 all present except (4,3) gone.\n\nEnemy at (8,3).\n\nNo other snakes.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (3,3) is clear.\n\nI think that's the best move.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple there. This grows my snake and gains a point. The enemy snake is far away at (8,3), so this move is safe. Next turn, I can consider moving DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple if possible.\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

Invalid move.\n- UP to (4,4): Empty space (no apple or obstacles).\n- DOWN to (4,2): Empty space (no apple, but (3,2) has an apple adjacent for potential next move).\n\nWhy LEFT is the best immediate move:\n- Eating the apple at (3,3) gains a point and grows my snake to length 3. This makes me stronger for future conflicts.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,3)\u2014far away and not an immediate threat. By moving left, I'm putting more distance between us.\n- After eating (3,3), I can directly access the apple at (3,2) by moving DOWN next turn for another quick point.\n- If I don't take this apple now, the enemy might eventually move toward it or I'd waste turns circling back.\n\nRisks of other moves:\n- UP or DOWN: I don't eat an apple, so I don't grow. My tail (5,3) disappears, leaving me smaller and weaker. Also, I miss the chance to chain apple eats with (3,2).\n- Staying or moving right is suicidal.\n\nLonger-term strategy: After eating (3,3) and potentially (3,2), I should path toward the cluster of apples at (6,5)/(6,6) while monitoring the enemy. The apple at (5,8) is isolated\u2014low priority for now. Enemy has no body, so it's vulnerable; if it makes a mistake, I can corner it later.\n\nFor this turn, LEFT is clearly optimal.

The board shows no obstacles there\u2014it's empty ('.' in the grid row for y=3). Moving left is safe and doesn't hit anything.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): This is my own body segment (the first 'T'). If I move here, I collide with myself and die. Invalid move.\n- UP to (2,4): Empty space (no apple or obstacles).\n- DOWN to (2,2): Empty space. Apple at (3,2) is adjacent but not directly on this path.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving LEFT to (1,3) is safe and positions me to potentially go down to (1,2) or (1,1) toward the apple at (1,0) soon. It also avoids immediate risks.\n- Moving UP to (2,4) or DOWN to (2,2) are also safe but don't gain an apple immediately. Down might be better to get closer to the apple at (3,2) next turn.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,5), far away. No threat this turn. It can move, but I don't need to react yet.\n\nBest move: LEFT\n- Why? It's safe, and it opens a path to the apple at (1,0). After moving to (1,3), I can move DOWN to (1,2) and then to (1,1) or (1,0) to eat the apple. Eating apples quickly grows my snake, making me more resilient against the enemy later.\n- Alternative: DOWN to (2,2) gets me closer to the apple at (3,2), but I can't eat it this turn. Next turn, from (2,2), I could move RIGHT to (3,2) to eat it. However, LEFT is slightly better because it starts a path to a cluster\u2014after (1,0), I can head toward other apples.\n- Risk of UP: Moves me away from apples, wasting time. I should prioritize apple collection.\n\nLong-term strategy: After eating (1,0), I should target (3,2), then the apples around (6,5) and (6,6).

Next turn, I could move right to (2,2) and then to (3,2) to eat it. Also, the apple at (1,0) is directly below me - I could go down to (1,1) and then (1,0) to eat that apple.\n\nComparing the moves:\n- DOWN seems strategically best because it positions me to target two apples: (3,2) and (1,0). I can choose based on enemy movement later.\n- LEFT is safe but less productive - it might lead to being cornered.\n- UP moves me away from the concentration of apples at lower y-levels.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,6). It has no body, so it can move freely. It might go for the apples at (6,6), (6,5), or (5,8). Since it's far away, I don't need to react to it immediately. I should focus on growing my snake first.\n\nLong-term strategy:\n- Eat the apple at (1,0) quickly to grow. Then head for (3,2), and later the cluster at (6,5)/(6,6).\n- With my current length of 3, growing will make me harder to kill.\n- Snake #0 is weak with no body - if I grow faster, I can potentially trap it later.\n\nBest move: DOWN\n- It brings me closer to multiple apples.\n- Avoids self-collision (right is blocked).\n- Sets up for efficient apple collection.\n\nI'll go with DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving down to (1,2), I can choose between going right toward (3,2) or down to (1,1) to target (1,0) apple. Monitor enemy movement.\n\nMOVE: DOWN",

Need to check if this is valid.\n- RIGHT: (2,2) - Is this occupied? Board shows '.' at (2,2), so it's empty.\n- UP: (1,3) - This was my previous head position, and now it's part of my body. So moving up to (1,3) would collide with myself.\n- DOWN: (1,1) - Empty space, no obstacles.\n\nNow, evaluating each valid move:\n\n1. LEFT to (0,2):\n   - (0,2) is within board. No snakes or apples there. Safe move.\n   - But it moves me away from the apples at (1,0) and (3,2). After this, I could go down to (0,1) or (0,0), but that might not be efficient.\n\n2. RIGHT to (2,2):\n   - Safe, empty cell. This brings me closer to the apple at (3,2). Next turn, I could move right to (3,2) to eat it.\n   - Also, from (2,2), I could later go down to (2,1) or up to (2,3) - but (2,3) is my body, so up would be blocked after this move.\n\n3. DOWN to (1,1):\n   - Safe, empty cell. This positions me to go directly down to (1,0) to eat the apple there on the next turn.\n   - Eating an apple quickly will make my snake grow.\n\nComparing the moves:\n- RIGHT allows me to target the apple at (3,2) in two moves: (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2)\n- DOWN allows me to target the apple at (1,0) in two moves: (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)\n- LEFT is safe but less productive - no apples in immediate range.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,7). It might be targeting the apples at (6,6), (6,5), or (5,8). Since it's far away, I don't need to worry about it immediately.\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- Eating an apple soon will help me grow. With a longer body, I can block the enemy snake later.\n- The apple at (1,0) is closer in terms of steps (only two moves away via down).\n- The apple at (3,2) is also two moves away via right.\n\nBoth apples are equally reachable. I need to think about positioning after eating.\n\nIf I go for (1,0):\n- After eating at (1,0), I'll be at (1,0) with a new body segment. Then I can head right toward (3,2) or up.\n\nIf I go for (3,2):\n- After eating at (3,2), I'll be at (3,2), and I can continue right or down.\n\nThe board has multiple apples, so I shouldn't hesitate too much.\n\nSafety check:\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,2) is safe - no enemy or walls.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,1) is safe.\n- Moving UP would kill me because my own body is at (1,3).\n- LEFT is safe but inefficient.\n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better because:\n- The apple at (3,2) is in the middle, so after eating it, I can easily go to other apples like (6,5) or (6,6).\n- Going to (1,0) is at the edge, which might limit my options temporarily.\n\nSo, I'll choose RIGHT to (2,2) to target the (3,2) apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember to go to (3,2) to eat the apple, unless something changes.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI need to maximize my growth by targeting the nearest apple. From my current position at (1,2), moving RIGHT to (2,2) positions me to eat the apple at (3,2) on the next turn. This is more efficient than moving DOWN toward (1,0) because (3,2) is centrally located, allowing better access to other apples afterward. Moving UP is suicidal due to my body segment at (1,3), and moving LEFT is safe but wastes time. Enemy snake #0 at (8,7) is distant and poses no immediate threat. Strategy for next turn: Move to (3,2) to eat the apple unless enemy movement changes the situation.\n\nMOVE: RIGHT",

So:\n  - (1,2) is my first body segment (since I just moved from there to (2,2))\n  - (1,3) is my second body segment (tail)\n\nNow, my head is at (2,2). Possible moves:\n\n- LEFT: to (1,2) - but this is occupied by my own body segment. Collision! Dead if I go there.\n- RIGHT: to (3,2) - this is the apple! I can eat it and grow.\n- UP: to (2,3) - empty space? Board shows nothing at (2,3). In the visualization, row 3 has (1,3) as T, but (2,3) should be empty since it's not marked.\n- DOWN: to (2,1) - empty space? Yes, board shows nothing at (2,1).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,8). It has no body, so it might move to an apple or away. Currently not a threat to me since it's far.\n\nEvaluating moves:\n\n1. RIGHT to (3,2): \n   - This is an apple! I eat it, grow by one segment, and gain a point. \n   - After eating, my head will be at (3,2), and my body becomes [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3)] - so I'll have three body segments. \n   - This is highly beneficial and directly achieves my goal.\n\n2. UP to (2,3):\n   - Safe move, empty space. \n   - From there, I could go up to (2,4) or right to (3,3), but it doesn't get me an apple immediately. \n   - Less efficient since I'm passing up a free apple.\n\n3. DOWN to (2,1):\n   - Safe move, empty space. \n   - Then I could go down to (2,0) or left/right, but there's an apple at (1,0) which I could target later. \n   - However, RIGHT gives me an apple now.\n\nWhat about other moves?

Why delay?\n\nNo risks: \n- Enemy snake is far away at (8,8). \n- Moving RIGHT doesn't run into any obstacles since (3,2) is an apple, not a snake or wall.\n\nStrategy after this:\n- After eating the apple at (3,2), my next move should be to continue toward other apples. \n- Options: \n  - RIGHT to (4,2) to head toward apples at (6,5)/(6,6), but that's a long path. \n  - DOWN to (3,1) to eventually target (1,0) apple. \n  - UP to (3,3) to open space. \n- I'll decide next turn based on enemy positions.\n\nFor now, RIGHT is the optimal move.\n\n</think>\n\nRIGHT",

So full body: [(3,2) head, (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) tail]\n\nPossible moves from head (3,2):\n- LEFT to (2,2): occupied by my own body segment at (2,2). If I go there, I die. Not an option.\n- RIGHT to (4,2): apple! If I go there, I eat the apple, grow, and gain a point.\n- UP to (3,3): empty? Board at row y=3: x=3 is not marked, so empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (3,1): empty? Row y=1 at x=3 is empty. Safe.\n\nEnemy snake at (9,8): far away, no immediate threat. It can move to (9,7), (9,9), (8,8) or (8,7) but since (5,8) is an apple, it might go for that.\n\nMy goal: maximize points. So eating apples is good. RIGHT leads directly to an apple at (4,2).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- RIGHT to (4,2): eat apple, grow to 5 segments (head + 4 body parts). Then next turn, from (4,2), I can go RIGHT to (5,2), UP to (4,3), or DOWN to (4,1). (5,2) is empty, and I can head towards other apples at (6,5) or (6,6) by moving up later.\n- UP to (3,3): empty space. Then from there, I might go LEFT to (2,3) or RIGHT to (4,3), etc., but no apple immediately. I could try to go towards (6,6) or (5,8), but it takes more moves.\n- DOWN to (3,1): also empty. Then I might go towards the apple at (1,0) by moving LEFT or DOWN again.\n\nEating the apple at (4,2) is very efficient since it's adjacent. Why pass it up? It's the shortest path to a point.\n\nRisks: \n- Moving RIGHT to (4,2) is safe because it's an apple, not a snake or wall. After eating, my tail will move forward, so (1,3) will be gone next turn? No, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move immediately. But since I'm moving to an apple, I add a segment and the tail stays where it is. So my body will be: head at (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3). So five segments.\n\nThen, the next turn, if I move from (4,2), my tail at (1,3) will still be there unless I move away. But no issue with that.\n\nEnemy snake at (9,8): it might eat the apple at (5,8). If it does, it will grow to two segments. But it's far from me, so not an immediate concern.\n\nStrategy:\n- Eat the apple at (4,2) now.\n- Then, consider going RIGHT to (5,2), then UP to (5,3), then to (5,4), etc., to reach the apples at (6,5) or (6,6). Alternatively, after (4,2), go UP to (4,3) and then RIGHT to (5,3), etc., to avoid being too linear.\n- The apple at (1,0) is also an option, but it's in the opposite direction and I have to go back through my body? But my body is at (1,2) and (1,3), so (1,1) is empty, and (1,0) is apple. If I go DOWN from (3,2) to (3,1), then LEFT to (2,1), then LEFT to (1,1), then DOWN to (1,0) to eat it. But that takes three moves, whereas the apple at (4,2) is one move away. So better to take the closer apple.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move.\n\nFor next turn, I should start heading towards the cluster of apples at (6,5) and (6,6). From (4,2), moving RIGHT to (5,2) is good, then I can go UP to (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), then RIGHT to (6,5) to eat that apple. Or after (5,2), go UP immediately if possible.\n\nBut for now, move RIGHT to (4,2).\n\nSo my decision: RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI should move RIGHT to eat the apple at (4,2) immediately. This increases my length and score with minimal risk. The enemy snake is too far to be a threat. After eating, I can plan a path toward the other apples. \n\nStrategy for next turn: From (4,2), move RIGHT to (5,2) to continue toward the apples at (6,5) or (6,6), or consider UP/DOWN based on the board state.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

A potential strategy for me is to grow in length by reaching an apple.\n\nThe nearest apple to my head (7, 3) is at (6, 5), but it might be intercepted by other snakes on the board, like Snake #1. I should also try to create distance from the other snakes to avoid collisions.\n\nAs I consider downs and ups, since the closest apple (6, 5) is reachable via a move to the right I'd say my next move should aim to align with the apple's spot on the x-axis and also give me some x-axis growth, making me less probable to go in a collision with another snake going rightward.\n\nHmmm, therefore my next move should be...

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think> I will not include any thinking in the response part.\n\nFirst, I see the board. My snake is at (5,3) with no body, so just a head. There are apples at (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (4,3). The enemy snake #0 is at (7,3) with no body either.\n\nI can move in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see what each move would do:\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). That's an empty space. From (5,4), I can see potential to go towards the apple at (6,5) or (4,3) which is close but already there? Wait, apple at (4,3) is one space away.\n\nCurrent position: (5,3). Apple at (4,3) is directly to the left? X decreases to the left, so from (5,3) to (4,3) is LEFT.\n\nApples: (6,5) is up-right, (3,3) is left, (3,2) is left and down, (1,0) is far left and down, (4,3) is left one step.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to my head? (5,3) to (4,3) is directly left. And there's an apple at (4,3). So if I move LEFT, I go to (4,3) and eat that apple.\n\nBut is that safe? Let me check for collisions.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3), which is to the right. Moving LEFT to (4,3) should be safe because it's away from the enemy.\n\nWhat about other moves:\n\n- RIGHT: (5,3) -> (6,3). That's empty now, but enemy is at (7,3), so if I go right to (6,3), then enemy could move left to (6,3) next turn? No, enemy could move in any direction, but currently at (7,3), it might move left to (6,3) or elsewhere. But if I go to (6,3), and enemy goes to (6,3), I die. But I don't know what the enemy will do. So it's risky to go towards the enemy.\n\n- UP: (5,3) -> (5,4). Then I'm moving away from the apples except (6,5) which is at (6,5) \u2013 from (5,4) I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5), but that takes two moves. Whereas if I go LEFT now, I eat the apple at (4,3) immediately and grow.\n\n- DOWN: (5,3) -> (5,2). That's towards the apple at (3,2)? (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, but first I go to (5,2), which is empty. Apple at (3,2) is below and left.\n\nBut moving LEFT directly gets me to apple (4,3) and I grow.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is at (3,3), which is left and up? From (5,3) to (3,3) is two left? X from 5 to 3, y same 3, so two steps left.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer.\n\nNow, is (4,3) occupied? Board shows: at (4,3) it's an apple? Let me see the board state:\n\nRow y=3: ... A A 1 . 0 ... so at x=3,y=3: A (apple), x=4,y=3: A (apple), x=5,y=3: 1 (me), x=6,y=3: . (empty), x=7,y=3: 0 (enemy).\n\nYes, so (4,3) has an apple. So moving LEFT to (4,3) eats it.\n\nNow, after eating, my snake will have a body part at (5,3), and head at (4,3).\n\nEnemy snake at (7,3) with no body, so it might also go for apples.\n\nApples available: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0). (4,3) will be eaten if I go there.\n\n(3,3) is also an apple, but if I go to (4,3), I'm next to (3,3) which is left, so I could go left again to eat it if I want.\n\nBut let's think about safety.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,3) seems safe because:\n\n- No wall: (4,3) is within 0-9.\n\n- No enemy: enemy is at (7,3), far away.\n\n- No self: I have no body, so no collision.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might come towards me, but currently it's not adjacent.\n\nNow, other moves:\n\n- RIGHT to (6,3): That's closer to enemy. If enemy moves left to (6,3), we collide and both die? Or since it's simultaneous, if we both move to same square, both die. So high risk.\n\n- UP to (5,4): Empty, but no immediate apple. Then from there, I could go right to (6,4) then up to (6,5) to eat that apple in two moves. But apple at (6,5) might be taken by enemy or I might be intercepted.\n\n- DOWN to (5,2): Then I can go left to (4,2) or (3,2) to eat apple at (3,2). But (3,2) is directly left and down from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (3,2) is two left, or left and down? (3,2) is x=3,y=2, so from (5,2) it's left two, no y change.\n\nBut moving DOWN first to (5,2) doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n\nWhereas LEFT gets me an apple immediately.\n\nAlso, apple at (1,0) is far, not worth going now.\n\nSo LEFT seems best for immediate growth.\n\nBut let's see if there's a trap or something.\n\nEnemy at (7,3) could move left to (6,3), but if I move LEFT to (4,3), I'm safe.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I don't get an apple, so I delay growth.\n\nDOWN to (5,2) is close to apple at (3,2), but still not eating it this turn.\n\nSimilarly, UP to (5,4) not eating apple at (6,5) this turn.\n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT are adjacent to apples? RIGHT to (6,3) is not an apple; apple at (6,5) is up.\n\nFrom (5,3), adjacent positions:\n\n- Left: (4,3) - apple\n\n- Right: (6,3) - empty\n\n- Up: (5,4) - empty\n\n- Down: (5,2) - empty\n\nSo only LEFT gives me an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT.\n\nBut what about the enemy? Could it threaten me?\n\nAfter I move to (4,3), my head is at (4,3), body at (5,3).\n\nEnemy at (7,3): it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf it moves LEFT to (6,3), then it's closer, but not adjacent to me. I'm at (4,3), it at (6,3), so two spaces away.\n\nThen I could move to (3,3) to eat that apple, or to (4,2) or whatever.\n\nNo immediate threat.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN or UP, it goes away.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nIs there any reason not to? For example, if I want to go for multiple apples.\n\nBut eating one apple now is good, and I can plan next.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,3) is right next to where I'll be if I move left, so I could eat that next turn if I want.\n\nWhereas if I go for (6,5), it might take longer.\n\nMoreover, (3,2) is below, etc.\n\nBut immediate gain: LEFT gives me +1 point and growth.\n\nOther moves don't.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nFinally, for next turn, I should remember to consider going for the apple at (3,3) if I move left now.\n\nOr explore other options.\n\nBut for now, move LEFT.",

Apples are at: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (6,6) \u2014 wait, the apples listed are (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), and (6,6)? But in the board display, I see apples at (6,5), (6,6)? No:\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Row y=5: ... . . . . . . A . . . \u2192 so (6,5) has apple\n- Row y=6: ... . . . . . . A . . . \u2192 (6,6) has apple? But apples listed are (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 that's five apples.\n\nIn the board:\ny=3: ... A A 1 T . . 0 ... \u2192 positions: (3,3) is A, (4,3) is A? No, let's parse:\nThe row for y=3: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think it's:\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: A (apple at (3,3))\nx=4: 1 (my head? But my head is at (4,3), and body at (5,3)? In the snake info, head is (4,3), body: [(5,3)]\n\nIn the board:\n\"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\"\n\nPerhaps the representation: it says \"A 1 T\" \u2014 T? That might be a typo or something. The user said: \"at (4,3) it's '1' for my head, and (5,3) is body? But in the string: \"A 1 T\" \u2014 let's see the columns.\n\nThe board row for y=3: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" and the columns are 0 to 9.\n\nSo: \nx=0: . (but at x=0, it's not shown for y=3, but from context: positions)\nActually, the board is printed with y from top to bottom? No, in the text: \"9 . . .\" down to \"0 . A . ...\"\n\ny=9 at top, y=0 at bottom.\n\nFor y=3 row: \"3 . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 I think the dots represent the cells, so let's count the characters.\n\nThe string: \"3 \" + 10 characters? \" . . . A 1 T . . 0 .\" \u2014 that's 10 characters? Let's list:\n\nAfter \"3 \", it's: . (x=0), . (x=1), . (x=2), A (x=3), 1 (x=4), T (x=5), . (x=6), . (x=7), 0 (x=8), . (x=9)\n\nx=0 to x=9 for y=3.\n\nSo:\nx=0: . (empty)\nx=1: . (empty)\nx=2: . (empty)\nx=3: A (apple) \u2014 so (3,3) apple\nx=4: 1 (my head) \u2014 snake 1 head at (4,3)\nx=5: T \u2014 what is T? Body? The user said body at (5,3), so T must represent the body of snake 1.\nx=6: . (empty)\nx=7: . (empty)\nx=8: 0 (enemy snake head at (8,3)? But enemy snake is at (8,3)? User said enemy head at (8,3), not (7,3).\n\nIn the initial description: \"Enemy snakes: Snake #0 - Head: (8,3), Body: none\"\n\nAnd in board: at x=8,y=3: 0, so (8,3)\n\nAlso, apples: at (6,5) and (6,6) from above rows? Let's see:\n\nRow y=5: \"5 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=5: A\n\nRow y=6: \"6 . . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 x=6,y=6: A\n\nAnd row y=2: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=3,y=2: A\n\nRow y=0: \"0 . A . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=1,y=0: A\n\nSo apples at: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 that matches the list.\n\nNow, my snake: head at (4,3), body at (5,3) \u2014 so one body segment.\n\nLast move I moved LEFT to (4,3)? From last move info, I moved LEFT, but before that my head was at (5,3) with no body? Last move I was at (5,3) head, and I moved LEFT to (4,3), which had an apple, so now I have a body at (5,3).\n\nCurrent state: head at (4,3), body at (5,3). I just ate the apple at (4,3), so now I have a tail.\n\nEnemy snake: head at (8,3), no body.\n\nApples still present: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 but I just ate (4,3), which was one, but it was listed? In the apples list, (4,3) was not listed; listed were (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6). (4,3) was an apple but it was eaten now? In the board, at (4,3) it was my head after move, but before it was apple? Confusion.\n\nInitial apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6)\n\nIn the board before my last move, at (4,3) it was apple? Yes, from last board state.\n\nAfter I moved LEFT to (4,3), I ate that apple, so now (4,3) is my head, and apple at (4,3) is gone.\n\nCurrent apples: (6,5), (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,6) \u2014 but (3,3) is still there, etc.\n\nNo, (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, which is still apple.\n\nIn the current board, (4,3) is my head, so not apple.\n\nApples remain: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNow, possible moves from my head at (4,3):\n\n- LEFT: to (3,3) \u2014 there is an apple there! So I can eat it and grow.\n\n- RIGHT: to (5,3) \u2014 but that's my body at (5,3). If I go there, I collide with myself and die. So not possible.\n\n- UP: to (4,4) \u2014 need to check if empty or what.\n\n- DOWN: to (4,2) \u2014 empty? From board, at (4,2) it should be empty? y=2 row: \"2 . . . A . . . . . .\" so x=3,y=2 is A, x=4,y=2 is . (empty)\n\nSimilarly, y=4 row: \"4 . . . . . . . . . .\" all empty around that.\n\nNow, enemy snake at (8,3), no body, so it can move freely.\n\nMy possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT to (3,3): that has an apple, so I eat it and grow. Then my head moves to (3,3), body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] \u2014 since I ate, I grow, so tail stays.\n\n2. UP to (4,4): empty, no apple. Then head at (4,4), body follows to (4,3), and tail at (5,3) remains? When I move without eating, the tail moves, so body becomes [(4,3), (5,3)] but when I move to (4,4), head to (4,4), body becomes [ (4,3) ] and tail at (5,3) disappears? Standard snake rules: when you don't eat, you move forward, so the tail end moves. Since I have one body segment, moving to (4,4) will leave (5,3) and the body becomes at (4,3), head at (4,4).\n\nCurrent: head (4,3), body (5,3)\n\nAfter move UP to (4,4): head to (4,4), body moves to (4,3). So the tail (5,3) is gone, and I have head at (4,4), body at (4,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat, I grow, so length increases.\n\n3. DOWN to (4,2): empty, no apple. Similar to UP, head to (4,2), body to (4,3), tail (5,3) gone.\n\nNow, RIGHT is invalid since (5,3) is my body.\n\nSo only LEFT, UP, DOWN are possible, but LEFT has an apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) seems very good because I get another apple immediately.\n\nIs it safe?\n\n- Wall: (3,3) is within bounds.\n\n- Self: no, my body is at (5,3) and moving to (4,3) when I move.\n\nAfter I move LEFT to (3,3), head at (3,3), body at (4,3), and since I ate, I grow, so tail remains at (5,3)? With growth: when you eat, the head moves to the apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So positions: head at (3,3), body segments: (4,3) and (5,3). So I have length 3 now.\n\nEnemy: at (8,3), far away. It might move towards apples or something.\n\nPossible threats: if enemy moves towards me, but it's 5 spaces away, not immediate.\n\nApples nearby: after eating (3,3), I can go to (3,2) which is apple below, or to (2,3) if empty, etc.\n\n(3,2) is apple at (3,2), which is directly below (3,3).\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN now, I don't get an apple, and I lose the opportunity to eat (3,3) which is adjacent.\n\nFor example, if I move UP to (4,4), then from there, I can go to (4,5) or something, but no apple immediate, and (3,3) is still there but not adjacent to (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (3,3) is left and down, but one step diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't go directly; I need to move to (3,4) first or (4,3) but (4,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving UP, if I go to (4,4), body at (4,3), so (4,3) is body, not free.\n\nThen I can move LEFT to (3,4)? But (3,4) might be empty, but no apple there.\n\nThen from there, I can go DOWN to (3,3) to eat apple, but that takes two moves, and in the meantime, enemy might eat it or something.\n\nSimilarly for DOWN move.\n\nMoreover, by moving LEFT now, I secure the apple quickly.\n\nAlso, with growth, I become longer, which might help in controlling space.\n\nRisk of moving LEFT: only if (3,3) is dangerous, but it has an apple and no obstacle.\n\nEnemy could potentially come, but it's far.\n\nEnemy at (8,3) can move: if it moves LEFT multiple times, it might come to (5,3) or something, but (5,3) is my tail after I move? After I move to (3,3), I have body at (4,3) and (5,3), so (5,3) is my tail.\n\nIf enemy moves left multiple times to (5,3), it might collide if I'm not there, but since it's my tail, if enemy moves to (5,3), it would collide with my body and die, but not affect me directly, as long as I'm not there.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3,2)? I can eat that next turn if I move to (3,3) now.\n\nThen I would have three apples in quick succession if I go (3,3) -> (3,2).\n\nBut first, this turn.\n\nUP or DOWN might be safer in terms of not growing too fast? But growing is good for points.\n\nAvoiding the enemy: enemy is at (8,3), I'm moving left, away, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the apple at (6,6) or (6,5), but they are far, and enemy is closer to them? Enemy at (8,3), (6,5) is at (6,5), which is left and up from enemy.\n\nEnemy could go UP and LEFT to get to (6,5) in two moves: from (8,3) to (7,3) then (6,4)? Not direct.\n\nFrom (8,3) to (6,5): delta x -2, delta y +2, so at least two moves, e.g., (7,4) then (6,5).\n\nBut I am at (4,3), to (6,5) is +2 x, +2 y, also two moves.\n\nBut why go there when I have apples right next to me.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is similar.\n\nSo best to eat the nearby apples.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nThen next turn, if possible, move DOWN to (3,2) to eat that apple too.\n\nThat would be efficient.\n\nFor now, move LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the board.\n\nAfter last move: I moved LEFT to (4,3), ate apple, so now head (4,3), body (5,3).\n\nApples: (3,3), (3,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,6) \u2014 all present except (4,3) gone.\n\nEnemy at (8,3).\n\nNo other snakes.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (3,3) is clear.\n\nI think that's the best move.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple there. This grows my snake and gains a point. The enemy snake is far away at (8,3), so this move is safe. Next turn, I can consider moving DOWN to (3,2) to eat another apple if possible.\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

Invalid move.\n- UP to (4,4): Empty space (no apple or obstacles).\n- DOWN to (4,2): Empty space (no apple, but (3,2) has an apple adjacent for potential next move).\n\nWhy LEFT is the best immediate move:\n- Eating the apple at (3,3) gains a point and grows my snake to length 3. This makes me stronger for future conflicts.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,3)\u2014far away and not an immediate threat. By moving left, I'm putting more distance between us.\n- After eating (3,3), I can directly access the apple at (3,2) by moving DOWN next turn for another quick point.\n- If I don't take this apple now, the enemy might eventually move toward it or I'd waste turns circling back.\n\nRisks of other moves:\n- UP or DOWN: I don't eat an apple, so I don't grow. My tail (5,3) disappears, leaving me smaller and weaker. Also, I miss the chance to chain apple eats with (3,2).\n- Staying or moving right is suicidal.\n\nLonger-term strategy: After eating (3,3) and potentially (3,2), I should path toward the cluster of apples at (6,5)/(6,6) while monitoring the enemy. The apple at (5,8) is isolated\u2014low priority for now. Enemy has no body, so it's vulnerable; if it makes a mistake, I can corner it later.\n\nFor this turn, LEFT is clearly optimal. I'll commit to that.\n\n</think>\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

My snake (ID:1) has its head at (2,3) and body segments at (3,3) and (4,3).

A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 'A' at x=1, y=0 is an apple.\n- Other apples: (6,5), (6,6), (5,8) are visible in their respective rows.\n\nMy snake's current position:\n- Head: (2,3)\n- Body: [(3,3), (4,3)] \u2014 so I have a length of 3.\n\nPossible moves from my head (2,3):\n- LEFT to (1,3): This would move to x=1, y=3. The board shows no obstacles there\u2014it's empty ('.' in the grid row for y=3). Moving left is safe and doesn't hit anything.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): This is my own body segment (the first 'T'). If I move here, I collide with myself and die. Invalid move.\n- UP to (2,4): Empty space (no apple or obstacles).\n- DOWN to (2,2): Empty space. Apple at (3,2) is adjacent but not directly on this path.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving LEFT to (1,3) is safe and positions me to potentially go down to (1,2) or (1,1) toward the apple at (1,0) soon. It also avoids immediate risks.\n- Moving UP to (2,4) or DOWN to (2,2) are also safe but don't gain an apple immediately. Down might be better to get closer to the apple at (3,2) next turn.\n- The enemy snake is at (8,5), far away. No threat this turn. It can move, but I don't need to react yet.\n\nBest move: LEFT\n- Why? It's safe, and it opens a path to the apple at (1,0). After moving to (1,3), I can move DOWN to (1,2) and then to (1,1) or (1,0) to eat the apple. Eating apples quickly grows my snake, making me more resilient against the enemy later.\n- Alternative: DOWN to (2,2) gets me closer to the apple at (3,2), but I can't eat it this turn. Next turn, from (2,2), I could move RIGHT to (3,2) to eat it. However, LEFT is slightly better because it starts a path to a cluster\u2014after (1,0), I can head toward other apples.\n- Risk of UP: Moves me away from apples, wasting time. I should prioritize apple collection.\n\nLong-term strategy: After eating (1,0), I should target (3,2), then the apples around (6,5) and (6,6). The enemy snake has no body, so it's weak\u2014I can try to trap it later if it grows. For now, focus on growth.\n\nI'll go with LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

It might be targeting the apples at (6,6), (6,5), or (5,8). Since it's far away, I don't need to worry about it immediately.\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- Eating an apple soon will help me grow. With a longer body, I can block the enemy snake later.\n- The apple at (1,0) is closer in terms of steps (only two moves away via down).\n- The apple at (3,2) is also two moves away via right.\n\nBoth apples are equally reachable. I need to think about positioning after eating.\n\nIf I go for (1,0):\n- After eating at (1,0), I'll be at (1,0) with a new body segment. Then I can head right toward (3,2) or up.\n\nIf I go for (3,2):\n- After eating at (3,2), I'll be at (3,2), and I can continue right or down.\n\nThe board has multiple apples, so I shouldn't hesitate too much.\n\nSafety check:\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,2) is safe - no enemy or walls.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,1) is safe.\n- Moving UP would kill me because my own body is at (1,3).\n- LEFT is safe but inefficient.\n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better because:\n- The apple at (3,2) is in the middle, so after eating it, I can easily go to other apples like (6,5) or (6,6).\n- Going to (1,0) is at the edge, which might limit my options temporarily.\n\nSo, I'll choose RIGHT to (2,2) to target the (3,2) apple.\n\nFor next turn, I should remember to go to (3,2) to eat the apple, unless something changes.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI need to maximize my growth by targeting the nearest apple. From my current position at (1,2), moving RIGHT to (2,2) positions me to eat the apple at (3,2) on the next turn. This is more efficient than moving DOWN toward (1,0) because (3,2) is centrally located, allowing better access to other apples afterward. Moving UP is suicidal due to my body segment at (1,3), and moving LEFT is safe but wastes time. Enemy snake #0 at (8,7) is distant and poses no immediate threat.

I'm not sure yet, I need to think about where I want to position my tail.\n\nBefore that, I need to clear the obstacles between me and the apple (6, 6). I should aim for (7, 6) and (6, 6) to get closer to the apple. Hmm, my next move is still a bit of a puzzle.\n\nConsidering the strategies I mentioned before (moving slowly down to (7, 6) and then right to (7, 5) in case I hit an apple at (8, 6)), I think it's better to aim for (7, 6) directly to keep my options open.\n\nNext turn strategy: Try to eat the apple at (6, 6) and then position myself to control my tail's distance and potentially get ahead of the enemy snake. For now, my next move will be... RIGHT.",

            "rationale": "<think> I need to understand the game state and choose the optimal move.\n\nFirst, current board state:\n- Apples at: (6,5), (1,0), (6,6), (5,8), (4,2)  // Note: (4,2) is new compared to last turn? Last turn had (3,2) but now that's gone since I ate it?\n- My snake (ID:1):\n  - Head: (3,2)  // I moved RIGHT to eat the apple at (3,2)\n  - Body: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3)]  // After eating, I grew to 4 segments including head? Head at (3,2), then body segments: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)\n- Enemy snakes:\n  - Snake #0: Head at (9,8), Body: none  // So it's a new snake with just a head? Or did it grow? Board says \"Body: none\" meaning no body segments.\n\nBoard visualization provided:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . A . . . 0  // Apple at (5,8), Snake #0 head at (9,8)? But it says (9,8) in the text, but visualization shows 0 at (9,8) for row 8? Let's parse the visualization:\n\nCoordinates: (0,9) top-left? No, bottom-left is (0,0), top-right is (9,9). Visualization is printed with y=9 at top.\n\nBoard:\nRow y=9: . . . . . . . . . . \nRow y=8: . . . . . A . . . 0  // So at (5,8) is apple, and (9,8) is snake #0 head? But (9,8) is at the end of row 8? Yes, x=9, y=8.\nRow y=7: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow y=6: . . . . . . A . . .  // Apple at (6,6)\nRow y=5: . . . . . . A . . .  // Apple at (6,5)\nRow y=4: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow y=3: . T . . . . . . . .  // T at (1,3) - that's my body segment? Yes, part of my body.\nRow y=2: . T T 1 A . . . . .  // T at (1,2) and (2,2), 1 at (3,2) (my head), and A at (4,2)? But apples are listed as (4,2) is an apple? In the text, apples include (4,2). Also, (1,0) is apple.\nRow y=1: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow y=0: . A . . . . . . . .  // Apple at (1,0)\nx: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo at row y=2: positions are:\nx=0: empty (.)\nx=1: T (my body segment at (1,2))\nx=2: T (my body segment at (2,2))\nx=3: 1 (my head at (3,2))\nx=4: A (apple at (4,2))  // Yes, apples include (4,2)\nx=5 to x=9: empty\n\nMy snake: head at (3,2), body segments at (2,2), (1,2), (1,3). So full body: [(3,2) head, (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) tail]\n\nPossible moves from head (3,2):\n- LEFT to (2,2): occupied by my own body segment at (2,2). If I go there, I die. Not an option.\n- RIGHT to (4,2): apple! If I go there, I eat the apple, grow, and gain a point.\n- UP to (3,3): empty? Board at row y=3: x=3 is not marked, so empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (3,1): empty? Row y=1 at x=3 is empty. Safe.\n\nEnemy snake at (9,8): far away, no immediate threat. It can move to (9,7), (9,9), (8,8) or (8,7) but since (5,8) is an apple, it might go for that.\n\nMy goal: maximize points. So eating apples is good. RIGHT leads directly to an apple at (4,2).\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- RIGHT to (4,2): eat apple, grow to 5 segments (head + 4 body parts). Then next turn, from (4,2), I can go RIGHT to (5,2), UP to (4,3), or DOWN to (4,1). (5,2) is empty, and I can head towards other apples at (6,5) or (6,6) by moving up later.\n- UP to (3,3): empty space. Then from there, I might go LEFT to (2,3) or RIGHT to (4,3), etc., but no apple immediately. I could try to go towards (6,6) or (5,8), but it takes more moves.\n- DOWN to (3,1): also empty. Then I might go towards the apple at (1,0) by moving LEFT or DOWN again.\n\nEating the apple at (4,2) is very efficient since it's adjacent. Why pass it up? It's the shortest path to a point.\n\nRisks: \n- Moving RIGHT to (4,2) is safe because it's an apple, not a snake or wall. After eating, my tail will move forward, so (1,3) will be gone next turn? No, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move immediately. But since I'm moving to an apple, I add a segment and the tail stays where it is. So my body will be: head at (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3). So five segments.\n\nThen, the next turn, if I move from (4,2), my tail at (1,3) will still be there unless I move away. But no issue with that.\n\nEnemy snake at (9,8): it might eat the apple at (5,8). If it does, it will grow to two segments. But it's far from me, so not an immediate concern.\n\nStrategy:\n- Eat the apple at (4,2) now.\n- Then, consider going RIGHT to (5,2), then UP to (5,3), then to (5,4), etc., to reach the apples at (6,5) or (6,6). Alternatively, after (4,2), go UP to (4,3) and then RIGHT to (5,3), etc., to avoid being too linear.\n- The apple at (1,0) is also an option, but it's in the opposite direction and I have to go back through my body? But my body is at (1,2) and (1,3), so (1,1) is empty, and (1,0) is apple. If I go DOWN from (3,2) to (3,1), then LEFT to (2,1), then LEFT to (1,1), then DOWN to (1,0) to eat it. But that takes three moves, whereas the apple at (4,2) is one move away. So better to take the closer apple.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move.\n\nFor next turn, I should start heading towards the cluster of apples at (6,5) and (6,6). From (4,2), moving RIGHT to (5,2) is good, then I can go UP to (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), then RIGHT to (6,5) to eat that apple. Or after (5,2), go UP immediately if possible.\n\nBut for now, move RIGHT to (4,2).\n\nSo my decision: RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI should move RIGHT to eat the apple at (4,2) immediately. This increases my length and score with minimal risk. The enemy snake is too far to be a threat. After eating, I can plan a path toward the other apples. \n\nStrategy for next turn: From (4,2), move RIGHT to (5,2) to continue toward the apples at (6,5) or (6,6), or consider UP/DOWN based on the board state.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",
