I have 0 apples.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Position (3, 1). Has 0 apples.\n*   **Apples:** Located at (5, 5), (6, 1), (9, 2), (3, 6), (8, 0).\n*   **Turn:** 0 / 150\n\n**Immediate Threats:**\n\n*   The enemy snake at (3, 1) is relatively close and could potentially intercept my snake's head if I move towards it.\n*   I am currently in a fairly open area.\n\n**Possible Moves and Analysis:**\n\n*   **UP:**  Moves my head to (0, 5). This is a potential danger as it moves me towards the enemy snake, but it also puts me closer to apple (5,5). A quick, small risk might be acceptable.\n*   **DOWN:** Moves my head to (2, 5).  This puts me closer to apple(8,0), but also towards the enemy snake.\n*   **LEFT:** Moves my head to (0, 4). This avoids the enemy snake, but is significantly further from the apples.\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves my head to (2, 5). This is a good option to move away from the enemy snake, but may not be optimal for apple acquisition given the proximity of the apple (8,0).\n\nGiven my location, the best option seems to be playing a safer move to avoid an immediate collision. Moving UP is the most dangerous, but DOWN and RIGHT are reasonable.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI\u2019ll choose to move UP to try and secure a better position in the middle of the board, and reduce the likelihood of a direct collision with the opponent. I will aim for a position where I have a clear path towards a potential apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n\nMy long-term plan is to continue growing by consuming apples and minimizing the risk of collisions. I\u2019ll try to move in a way that allows me to explore different segments of the board and secure a larger number of apples. I am going to be careful of staying close to the enemy snake.\n\nUP",
