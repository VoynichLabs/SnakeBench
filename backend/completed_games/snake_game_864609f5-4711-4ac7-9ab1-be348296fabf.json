This move will also give us a point and allow our snake to grow.\n\nAs for strategy, it might be beneficial to keep an eye on the positions of other snakes and plan our moves accordingly to avoid potential collisions. Also, we should prioritize collecting apples that are closer to us to minimize the risk of running into other snakes or the wall.\n\nNext, after collecting the apple at (8, 1), we should reassess the board state and consider moving towards other nearby apples, possibly the one at (7, 3) or (2, 0), depending on the updated positions of other snakes and the board state.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"
