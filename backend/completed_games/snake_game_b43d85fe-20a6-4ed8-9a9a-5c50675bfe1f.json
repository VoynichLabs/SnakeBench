If I end up at (9, 8) without eating an apple, any apple that's in my path down from there or to my left would potentially allow me to eat it and gain points. If I move right, though, and there aren't any nearby apples, I'd have to find a different direction for a new apple, considering the position of snake #1 and my own recent movements.\n\nThis current positioning would also give me a small advantage vertically as I now have flexibility potentially to deal with some issues like threat from snake #1. It might give me some small compensation if I consumed the apple below, but abstractly thinking, that will put me in an awful position if snake #1 heads up and to the left, precisely to take the middle triangle.\n\nIf I go right at this moment, considering the board and our possible moves, it'll also allow me just a little more safety and more grip on reliability that I'm most able to expand out at the ground level.

I'd rather move towards an apple.\n\nHmm, considering my current body length and head position, my best immediate option is to move to a location that brings me closer to an apple while keeping me safe from other snakes and walls.\n\nIt seems like my strategy for now is to prioritize appletivity while gradually growing and maintaining control.\n\nThe westward direction seems safer because the board won't immediately kill me with a boundary clash.\n\nI would like to observe how my decision to explore the western possibilities for the next turn would allow me to approach a target apple in that location more smoothly.\n\nConsidering the potential outcomes, my next move will be: LEFT",

This way, we'll be closer to the apple and outside the horizontal range of the other apple at (5, 9). However, it's essential to prioritize apples and opt for a move that doesn't place us in a narrow position.\n\nI'd like to remind myself to maintain a safe distance from the apple at (1, 3) and look for ways to approach it without getting too close to the horizontal wall (x-coordinate 0).\n\nSince I'm at y-coordinate 1, moving down (decreasing y-coordinate) would put me closer to apples. However, considering the rules and the need to reposition myself, I'd also like to assess moving left towards a position outside the direct path to the apple while having no immediate obstacles ahead.\n\nAt this point, I think it's essential to focus on keeping the apples close and within our reach. The vertical positioning of our current head (3, 1) implies that moving up or down would be a better next move since it combines growing with minimal risk and safety from other snakes and walls.",

At this point, I should assess if clearing the gap is possible without any risks such as collisions with other snakes or myself.\n\nUpon examining the situation, I have some concerns about moving left further since the position (1, 2) has the apple present, so I can't continue left and I also don't want to go down to (2, 1) since the apple (9, 1) is still too far for now. An immediate goal change - I could move upwards instead, trying to reach any apple directly above me and also analyzing my options for future moves to bridge apple (5, 9). Next turn I will likely move down or up - that is the priority.\n\n For now: NEXT CHANGE Strategy/ Thoughts priority - continually planning safe but beneficial moves.\n\nBut, for this turn - Decreasing my y coordinate (going down) is the safest route forward as it minimizes my exposure to potential collisions at the expense of going up without finding an immediate new hazard.\n\nThe direction for my next move is DOWN.",
