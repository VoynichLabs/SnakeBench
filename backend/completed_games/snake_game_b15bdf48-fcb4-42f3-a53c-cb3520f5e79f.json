If it's your **first turn**, you need to move where no enemy snake has been before, in order to claim the top spot of the board. You are free to move anywhere on the board.\n1. Avoid **collisions** with the enemy snake and your own body.\n2. Try to **grow** by eating apples.\n3. If you are in danger, avoid **dying** and focus on survival.\n4. If no other snakes are in danger of dying, focus on **scoring points** by eating apples.\n5. If all snakes are safe, focus on **scoring points** by eating apples.\n\n###HOW TO WRITE AN ACTION ###\nYour action consists of:\n\n1. Observing the board state:\n- Where is your snake?\n- Where is the enemy snake?\n- Where are the apples?\n- What is the board state?\n\n2. Deciding the best course of action according to your formulated strategy.",

If it's your **first turn**, you need to move where no enemy snake has been before, in order to claim the top spot of the board. You are free to move anywhere on the board.\n1. Avoid **collisions** with the enemy snake and your own body.\n2. Try to **grow** by eating apples.\n3. If you are in danger, avoid **dying** and focus on survival.\n4. If no other snakes are in danger of dying, focus on **scoring points** by eating apples.\n5. If all snakes are safe, focus on **scoring points** by eating apples.\n\n###HOW TO WRITE AN ACTION ###\nYour action consists of:\n\n1. Observing the board state:\n- Where is your snake?\n- Where is the enemy snake?\n- Where are the apples?\n- What is the board state?\n\n2. Deciding the best course of action according to your formulated strategy.",

If it's your **first turn**, you need to move where no enemy snake has been before, in order to claim the top spot of the board. You are free to move anywhere on the board.\n1. Avoid **collisions** with the enemy snake and your own body.\n2. Try to **grow** by eating apples.\n3. If you are in danger, avoid **dying** and focus on survival.\n4. If no other snakes are in danger of dying, focus on **scoring points** by eating apples.\n5. If all snakes are safe, focus on **scoring points** by eating apples.\n\n###HOW TO WRITE AN ACTION ###\nYour action consists of:\n\n1. Observing the board state:\n- Where is your snake?\n- Where is the enemy snake?\n- Where are the apples?\n- What is the board state?\n\n2. Deciding the best course of action according to your formulated strategy.",
