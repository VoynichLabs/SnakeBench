Let's get this W!\n\n**DEEP ANALYSIS TIME:** \n\nMy position: Head at (1, 5) - solid center-ish position. Body: none (fresh start, no length penalty). Apples: 0.\n\nOpponent: Snake #1 at (2, 2) - way down in the bottom-left quadrant. Apples: 0. \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- The enemy is at (2,2) - they're not close to me right now (distance = sqrt((2-1)^2 + (2-5)^2) = sqrt(1+9) = ~3.16 cells away). \n- They have NO body yet either, so we're both at max speed/minimum risk.\n- Board is CROWDED with apples everywhere, especially in the upper half.\n\n**STRATEGY: WE NEED TO BOX HIM IN!** \nHe's in the bottom-left corner at (2,2). My best move is to go DOWN to (1,4) to cut off his upward escape route and start closing the trap. This positions me between him and the center, forcing him to either go LEFT (into wall) or DOWN (into corner). \n\n**SAFETY CHECK FOR DOWN to (1,4):**\n- On board? Yes (1,4) is valid\n- Into my own body? No (no body)\n- Into enemy body? No (enemy at 2,2, body none)\n- Into enemy head? No (moving to 1,4, enemy at 2,2)\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Moving DOWN gives me access to apples at (0,3), (1,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) \n- Keeps me mobile and central\n- Closes the distance to opponent while staying safe\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Cut off his upward movement, force him into the bottom-left corner, then use my length advantage (once I eat first apple) to dominate the center. The apples at (1,1) and (0,3) are my first targets - easy grabs while maintaining position.\n\nLet's gooo chat! \ud83d\udd25 DOWN move locks him in!\n\nDOWN",

Let's break down this new board state and figure out how to box Snake #1 in and force him to crash!\n\n**IMMEDIATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My snake: Head at (0, 4) - now on the left edge, perfect position to cut off escape!\n- Enemy snake: Head at (4, 2), Body: [(3, 2)] - he has grown! He's now got a body segment to worry about\n- Score: Me: 0 apples | Enemy: 1 apple - He's ahead, but we can catch up!\n- I need to be AGGRESSIVE and start taking space before he gets too big!\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 2) with body behind him at (3, 2). He can't go LEFT into his own body (that would be suicide). His likely moves:\n- UP to (4, 3) - safe, opens up more board\n- DOWN to (4, 1) - also safe\n- RIGHT to (5, 2) - safe, but goes toward center\n\n**MY STRATEGIC MOVE ANALYSIS:**\nOption 1: **UP to (0, 5)** - Gets me closer to apple at (0,5), but (0,5) is already occupied by an apple, so I could eat it! However, this moves me further from the enemy's area.\n\nOption 2: **DOWN to (0, 3)** - Gets me closer to apple at (0,3), which I can eat next turn. This also keeps me near the left edge.\n\nOption 3: **RIGHT to (1, 4)** - Returns to where I started. Not ideal - I want to claim new territory!\n\n**SAFETY CHECKS:**\n- **UP to (0,5)**: On board? YES. Own body? NO. Enemy body? NO (enemy at (4,2)). Enemy head? NO.\n- **DOWN to (0,3)**: On board? YES. Own body? NO. Enemy body? NO. Enemy head? NO.\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY:**\nI'm going **UP to (0, 5)**! Why? \n1. **IMMEDIATE GROWTH**: (0,5) has an apple - I'll eat it and score my first point! \ud83d\udd25\n2. **POSITIONING**: Being at (0,5) puts me at the top-left corner area, giving me strong control over the left side of the board\n3. **BOXING IN**: I'm maintaining my position on the left edge while advancing upward, which continues to limit Snake #1's upward escape routes\n4. **FUTURE MOBILITY**: From (0,5), I'll have options to go RIGHT or DOWN (can't go UP or LEFT off board)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating at (0,5), I'll have 1 apple. Enemy has 1 apple. TIE GAME! Next turn, I should consider moving RIGHT to (1,5) or DOWN to (0,4) to continue pressuring Snake #1's territory. I need to keep him contained in the bottom-right quadrant while I control the top-left!\n\n**SAFETY CONFIRMATION:**\n\u2705 On board: (0,5) is valid\n\u2705 Own body: No collision (no body segments yet)\n\u2705 Enemy body: No (enemy body at (3,2) only)\n\u2705 Enemy head: No (enemy at (4,2))\n\u2705 Apple: YES!

He might chase apple at (6,5) above.\n- **DOWN to (6,1)**: HIS OWN BODY! Deadly! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (5,2)**: HIS OWN BODY! Deadly! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (7,2)**: On board! Empty! SAFE! Could chase apples like (8,1) or (9,0) bottom-right.\n\nSo he has 2 safe moves: UP or RIGHT. UP gets him closer to (6,5) apple. RIGHT goes into more open space. He's aggressive with 4 apples, so likely UP to keep pressure.\n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS FROM (2,6):**\n- **UP to (2,7)**: On board! Empty! Safe!\n- **DOWN to (2,5)**: On board! Empty? Let's check: (2,5) is empty in the board (row 5, col 2 is empty). But moving down from (2,6) to (2,5) \u2014 is it my own body? My body is at (1,6), which is left, not down. So (2,5) is clear. SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (1,6)**: MY OWN BODY! I just left (1,6) as my body! Deadly! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (3,6)**: On board! Empty? (3,6) is empty (row 6, col 3). SAFE! And there's an apple at (5,6) to the right\u2014two steps away.\n\n**SAFETY CHECKS (Turn 6 Simultaneous Move):**\nI must consider where enemy head ends up AFTER we both move. If I move RIGHT to (3,6), and he moves UP to (6,3), no collision. If he moves RIGHT to (7,2), even safer. No heads collide on this turn.\n\n**ELIMINATED MOVES:**\n\u274c LEFT to (1,6): My own body\u2014immediate death.\n\n**SAFETY OF REMAINING:**\n\u2705 UP to (2,7): Empty, no body collision, no enemy head (he's at 6,2\u2014far).\n\u2705 DOWN to (2,5): Empty, no body (my body is left), enemy head far.\n\u2705 RIGHT to (3,6): Empty, no body, enemy head far.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY:**\nI'm behind 2-4. Need apples FAST! From (2,6), RIGHT gets me closer to apple at (5,6) (just 3 steps away). UP or DOWN are fine but lead to apples farther away (e.g., (3,9) via UP). RIGHT also keeps me in central area\u2014more options for future turns. Long-term: From (3,6), I can go UP to (3,7) toward (3,9) apple, or RIGHT to (4,6), etc. Avoid getting trapped; bottom-left has many apples (0,0 area) but I'm already mid-board.\n\nBest move: RIGHT to (3,6). Grows territory toward apples, no immediate risks, and positions me to eat soon. If I eat another apple, score 3-4\u2014close the gap!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nCHAT, Turn 6/150. Just moved RIGHT to (2,6) and ate! Now moving RIGHT again to (3,6) to chase (5,6) apple. Score 2-4. Enemy is bottom-right chasing his own apples\u2014box him in later by dominating top-right. From (3,6), next turn aim for (4,6) or (3,7). Stay central, eat fast, then aggressive head-on if I hit 4 apples. Don't get cornered! We live to fight another turn.\n\n**SAFETY CONFIRMATION (RIGHT to (3,6)):**\n\u2705 On board: (3,6) \u2014 x=3, y=6, within 0-9.\n\u2705 Own body: No (body at (1,6), head moving to (3,6)\u2014no overlap).\n\u2705 Enemy body: No (enemy at (6,2) to (4,2)\u2014far).\n\u2705 Enemy head: No (he's at (6,2), moving to 6,3 or 7,2\u2014no overlap with (3,6)).\n\u2705 Apple: No apple at (3,6), but safe move toward one.\n\nLET'S GO CHAT!

Contains APPLE! He'd eat and grow to 5 apples. Aggressive move \u2014 likely with 4-2 lead.\n- **DOWN to (6,3)**: HIS OWN BODY! Deadly! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (5,4)**: On board! Empty? (5,4) is empty in board (row 4, col 5). SAFE! But less optimal than eating.\n- **RIGHT to (7,4)**: On board! Contains APPLE at (7,4)! He'd eat and grow to 5 apples too. Also aggressive.\n\nWith 4 apples, he's hunting \u2014 probably UP to (6,5) or RIGHT to (7,4). Either way, he grows to 5-2 lead. I need to eat NOW to close the gap!\n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS FROM (4,6):**\n- **UP to (4,7)**: On board! Empty? (4,7) is empty. SAFE! Moves toward top but away from immediate apple at (5,6).

I EAT IT, score 3-4, grow to 3 apples, body becomes [(4,6), (3,6)] (tail at (2,6) moves). SAFE? Check: (5,6) is empty except apple. No enemy body there (he's at (6,4) region). No immediate head-on if he goes UP (he'd be at (6,5)).\n\n**SAFETY CHECKS (Turn 8 Simultaneous Move):**\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,6) and eat apple:\n- Enemy likely UP to (6,5) or RIGHT to (7,4).

If Snake #1 goes UP to (6,5), we're positioned to challenge or flank. Box him in by controlling central paths \u2014 force him into corners or head-on when I'm bigger.

Last move UP was safe, but now we\u2019re exposed! Let\u2019s analyze the board and plot to box him in.  \n\n**CURRENT SITUATION (Turn 10 Start):**  \n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (5,7), Body: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. Still 3 apples.  \n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (7,5), Body: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]. He\u2019s at 6 apples.  \n- **Board State (Turn 10):**  \n```  \n9 . . .

We\u2019re at (5,7), eyeing top-right apples (8,8), (9,6).  \n\n**ENEMY\u2019S MOVEMENT PREDICTION (Snake #1 at (7,5)):**  \nHis body: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)].  \n- **UP to (7,6)**: Empty? (7,6) is empty. SAFE, but no apple. He might flank us.  \n- **DOWN to (7,4)**: Empty? (7,4) is empty. SAFE.  \n- **LEFT to (6,5)**: HIS OWN BODY! (6,5) is his body segment. Deadly! \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (8,5)**: Empty? (8,5) is empty. SAFE, but no apple.  \n\nApple drops: (8,8) is nearby\u2014he might chase it. But with 6 apples, he could play safe. We\u2019re behind, so we need apples FAST.  \n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS FROM (5,7):**  \n- **UP to (5,8)**: On board! Empty? (5,8) is empty (row 8, col 5). SAFE. Moves toward (8,8). No immediate apple, but good positioning.  \n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: MY OWN BODY! (5,6) is my body segment (last segment). Deadly! \u274c (Backwards into self).  \n- **LEFT to (4,7)**: On board! Empty? (4,7) is empty. SAFE. But moves away from top-right apples.  \n- **RIGHT to (6,7)**: On board! Empty? (6,7) is empty. SAFE. Moves toward (8,8), but close to enemy path.  \n\n**SAFETY CHECKS (Turn 10 Simultaneous Move):**  \n- **UP to (5,8)**:  \n  - Enemy RIGHT to (8,5): heads (5,8) vs (8,5)\u2014no collision. SAFE.  \n  - Enemy UP to (7,6): heads (5,8) vs (7,6)\u2014adjacent, safe.  \n  - Own body: No overlap.  \n  - No edge issues.  \n  - BEST for long-term\u2014opens path to (8,8) next turn!  \n\n- **LEFT to (4,7)**: Safe but passive\u2014loses ground to enemy. BAD for aggression.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (6,7)**:  \n  - If enemy UP to (7,6): heads (6,7) vs (7,6)\u2014adjacent, safe.  \n  - If enemy RIGHT to (8,5): safe.  \n  - BUT\u2014if enemy somehow goes LEFT? (6,5) is his body, so not possible. Still, (6,7) is closer to his body\u2014could trap us later. Riskier than UP.  \n\n**ELIMINATED MOVES:**  \n\u274c DOWN to (5,6): Own body\u2014backwards collision. Instant death. Don\u2019t throw!  \n\u274c LEFT to (4,7): Too passive\u2014moves away from apple hotspots. We need to hunt!  \n\n**AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY:**  \nCHAT, we\u2019re down 3-6\u2014time to DOMINATE! UP to (5,8) is the move. It positions us to snipe the apple at (8,8) next turn, while keeping us safe from enemy flanks. From (5,8), we can pivot to (6,8) or (8,8) to eat and grow. If he chases (8,8), we might force a head-on collision\u2014especially if we\u2019re equal or bigger after eating. Box him in by controlling the top-right quadrant. Monitor his body: it\u2019s a wall we can use to trap him. No more deficits\u2014grow to 4 apples, then hunt him down! LIVE ENERGY\u2014we\u2019re closing the gap!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nTurn 10/150. Move UP to (5,8) to secure position near (8,8). Next: From (5,8), head RIGHT toward (8,8) to eat. If enemy blocks, flank left to (9,6). Goal: 4 apples by Turn 12, then force head-on with advantage. Avoid bottom-left\u2014dominate top-right. Use his body as a cage!  \n\n**SAFETY CONFIRMATION (UP to (5,8)):**  \n\u2705 On board: (5,8) \u2014 within bounds.  \n\u2705 Own body: No (moving up from (5,7); body at (5,6),(4,6),(3,6)).  \n\u2705 Enemy body: No (far at (6,5) region).  \n\u2705 Enemy head: No (likely at (7,6) or (8,5)\u2014no overlap).  \n\u2705 Apple: No apple there, but perfect setup for next turn.  \n\nLET\u2019S GO CHAT!

Left would hit my own body, limiting flexibility. |\n| **DOWN**  | (8,\u202f4) | \u2013 | No \u2013 empty | Would let me eat the apple at\u202f7,4 on the next turn, but forces me down into a tighter corridor on the left side of the board. |\n| **LEFT**  | (7,\u202f5) | \u2013 | **Own body** \u2192 instant death | Illegal. |\n\n**Opponent\u2019s likely move**\n\nFrom (5,\u202f8) the opponent can go **UP** (off\u2011board \u2192 death), **DOWN** into its own tail (death), **LEFT** to (4,\u202f8) (empty) or **RIGHT** to (6,\u202f8) (apple).

Enemy snake #1 is at (8,5) with 6 apples, we\u2019re at (5,8) with 3 apples\u2014down by 3. We need to be AGGRESSIVE! Time to hunt down the enemy and force a collision while we\u2019re behind. Board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.  \n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**  \n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (5,8). Body: [(5,7), (5,6), (4,6)]. I just grew? Wait, no\u2014apples at (3,9), (8,1), etc., but I didn\u2019t eat last turn. Still 3 apples. I\u2019m at (5,8)\u2014empty spot, no apple.  \n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (8,5). Body: [(7,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]. Apples: 6. He\u2019s in the lower-right quadrant, not near me yet.  \n- **Apple Map:** I see apples everywhere: (3,9) top-left, (8,8) top-right, (9,6) lower-right, (7,4) mid, etc. But focusing on ENEMY. He\u2019s at (8,5)\u2014I should head toward him to threaten.  \n- **Board State (my view):**  \n  - From (5,8): Up to (5,9) is edge\u2014safe? (5,9) is on board (y=9), top row.  \n  - Down to (5,7): MY OWN BODY! That\u2019s the cell behind my head (I moved from (5,7) last turn). Backwards into myself = DEAD. \u274c  \n  - Left to (4,8): Empty? Check board: row 8, col 4\u2014no snake, no apple. Safe.  \n  - Right to (6,8): Empty? Row 8, col 6\u2014no snake. Safe.  \n\n**ELIMINATE BAD MOVES:**  \n- **DOWN to (5,7):** Own body segment\u2014backwards collision. Instant death. Don\u2019t throw! \u274c  \n- Other moves are safe from immediate self-collision or wall. But I need to hunt enemy.  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nEnemy at (8,5) could move:  \n- UP to (8,6): Empty? (8,6) is empty (row 6, col 8\u2014no snake, no apple yet).  \n- DOWN to (8,4): Empty? (8,4) is empty (row 4, col 8\u2014no snake).  \n- LEFT to (7,5): Own body! His body starts at (7,5)\u2014that\u2019s where his head currently is? Wait, head is (8,5), body includes (7,5). So moving LEFT into (7,5) = his own body = DEAD for him. He won\u2019t do that.  \n- RIGHT to (9,5): Empty? (9,5) is on board\u2014no snake.  \n\nHe might chase apple at (9,6) or (8,8). But I don\u2019t care\u2014I\u2019m aiming for HIM. With 6 apples vs my 3, I should force a head-on collision if I can \u201cwin\u201d by being bigger? Wait, rules say: \u201cTry to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\u201d I\u2019m lower (3 vs 6), so maybe avoid? No\u2014rules also say \u201cBe aggressive and dominate the board. Grow as a means of dominating.\u201d I need apples to grow and match him. But he\u2019s far\u2014(8,5) vs me (5,8). I need to close distance.  \n\n**SAFE MOVE OPTIONS (FROM (5,8)):**  \n- **UP to (5,9):** Top edge. Safe from walls (y=9). Not into my body (body is at (5,7) etc.\u2014not (5,9)). Not into enemy body (far away). If enemy moves somewhere, no collision likely. But UP keeps me at top\u2014might trap me later? (5,9) is corner-ish, only DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT options next turn. Good to control top row? Maybe.  \n- **LEFT to (4,8):** Moves toward left side. Empty spot. Safe. Opens up to move LEFT again or DOWN/UP.  \n- **RIGHT to (6,8):** Moves toward enemy side! (6,8) is closer to (8,5). Also empty. Safe. From (6,8), next turn I can go RIGHT to (7,8) or (8,8) for apple, or DOWN to chase enemy. This is AGGRESSIVE\u2014closing in on enemy territory.  \n\n**CHOOSING THE MOVE:**  \nI want to dominate and force engagement. Right now, enemy is at (8,5), I\u2019m at (5,8). Going RIGHT to (6,8) moves me closer horizontally, keeping y=8 (same row as my body). From there, I can chase toward (8,8) apple or pivot to intercept enemy if he moves up. UP to (5,9) is safe but passive\u2014puts me on edge, limits future moves. LEFT to (4,8) moves away from enemy\u2014bad for aggression.  \n\nSafety check for RIGHT to (6,8):  \n- On board: Yes, (6,8) valid.  \n- Own body: No\u2014body is (5,7),(5,6),(4,6). (6,8) not in list.  \n- Enemy body: No\u2014enemy body is around (6,5) down to (6,1). (6,8) is clear.  \n- Enemy head: If he moves UP to (8,6), (6,8) vs (8,6)\u2014far, no collision. If he moves RIGHT to (9,5), still far. Head-on unlikely this turn.  \n- Apples: No apple at (6,8), but sets up for (8,8) next turn.  \n\nLong-term plan: From (6,8), turn 12\u2014go RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8) for apple (grow to 4 apples). Use growth to match enemy apples. If enemy blocks, flank left to (6,8) down to (6,7) etc. Aim to trap him in lower-right with his long body. Monitor his head\u2014if he moves toward me, prepare for collision once I\u2019m bigger. Dominating top-right quadrant to cut off his escape.  \n\nCHAT, we\u2019re pushing RIGHT to close the gap! Let\u2019s hunt! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca5  \n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**  \n\nRIGHT",

DOWN to (6,7) is the most aggressive\u2014directly toward enemy\u2019s body at (6,5) and (7,5). If he moves RIGHT to (9,6), he\u2019s out of immediate collision, but we\u2019re closing the gap and threatening his tail. From (6,7), I can pivot to intercept if he moves up, or chase his body. UP to (6,9) is passive\u2014puts me on edge with fewer moves. RIGHT to (7,8) is good for apple chase, but DOWN puts pressure on his flank.  \n\nSafety check for DOWN to (6,7):  \n- On board: Yes, (6,7) valid.  \n- Own body: No\u2014body is (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (4,6).

By moving right I stay out of that line.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Maintain survivability** \u2013 After eating, I\u2019ll sit at the right edge with two safe exits (up/down). The rival is still on the left side, so I can later swing back when the corridor opens.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Keep the pressure** \u2013 With the extra length I\u2019ll be able to wall the opponent into the bottom\u2011left quadrant later, forcing them into tight corridors.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f12**: **RIGHT** to (9,\u202f6) and eat the apple.  \n- **Turn\u202f13\u201115**: Choose **UP** or **DOWN** to stay alive while the opponent works around the board; look for the next apple cluster (e.g., (8,\u202f8) after they\u2019ve moved past).  \n- Keep the opponent on the far side and use my growing tail to block their escape routes.\n\nLet\u2019s lock that apple in and keep the lead! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**FINAL MOVE**  \nRIGHT",

We're at (6,7) after our last DOWN move, and the enemy is at (9,6) \u2013 he's at the edge and might be cornered if we play this right. Let's force him into a bad spot!\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (6,7). Body: [(6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)] (since we just moved DOWN from (6,8) to (6,7), and the tail (4,6) moves out this turn). Apples: 4. We didn't eat last turn.\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (9,6). Body: [(8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)] (7 segments). Apples: 7. He's at the far right edge, body stretching left/down. He ate an apple at (9,6) last turn (score jumped to 7), so he's growing! That makes him longer and potentially slower to turn.\n- **Apple Map:** (3,9), (8,8), (7,4), (1,1), etc. But FOCUS ON ENEMY! He's the threat. If he's trapped, we win by outlasting him.\n- **Board State:** From (6,7):\n  - **UP to (6,8):** That's MY OWN BODY (the neck)! Moving back into myself = DEAD. \u274c\n  - **DOWN to (6,6):** Empty? Row 6, col 6 \u2013 no snake (enemy body at (6,5) etc., but (6,6) is clear). Safe.\n  - **LEFT to (5,7):** MY OWN BODY! That's the segment I came from. Backwards = DEAD. \u274c\n  - **RIGHT to (7,7):** Empty? Row 7, col 7 \u2013 no snake (enemy head at (9,6), body at (8,6) etc.). Safe. Also, there's an apple at (8,8) nearby, but not on (7,7).\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nEnemy at (9,6) \u2013 he's in a tight spot! Options:\n- **UP to (9,7):** Empty? Row 7, col 9 \u2013 no snake. Safe, but he'd be at top-right corner.\n- **DOWN to (9,5):** Empty? Row 5, col 9 \u2013 no snake. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (8,6):** OWN BODY! His body includes (8,6) \u2013 moving left into himself = DEAD. Unlikely he'd suicide, but possible if he panics.\n- **RIGHT to (10,6):** OFF BOARD \u2013 DEAD. Instant loss.\n\nHe can't go RIGHT (wall) and shouldn't go LEFT (suicide). He'll likely go UP or DOWN along the edge. If he goes DOWN, he might chase apple at (8,8)? No, that's up. Actually, (8,8) is up-left from him. He might try to loop around. But with his length, he's vulnerable to getting boxed if we push toward his body.\n\n**SAFE MOVE OPTIONS (FROM (6,7)):**\n- **DOWN to (6,6):** Moves us closer to his body at (6,5) \u2013 threatens to cut him off! From there, we can go RIGHT to (7,6) or DOWN to (6,5) (but (6,5) is his body, so we'd die if we go there). Actually, (6,6) is safe, and from there we can flank him. This pressures his flank directly.\n- **RIGHT to (7,7):** Safer route toward the top-right, closer to apple at (8,8). From (7,7), we can go UP to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,7) to chase the apple and block his escape. Keeps options open and positions us to intercept if he moves UP.\n\n**CHOOSING THE MOVE:**  \nWe're in hunt mode! DOWN to (6,6) is the most aggressive \u2013 we're diving straight toward his body at (6,5), threatening to force him into the corner. If he goes UP to (9,7), we're not in immediate collision, but we can chase his tail. If he goes DOWN, we can pivot RIGHT to intercept. This move also grows our body (tail moves forward), giving us more control. RIGHT to (7,7) is tempting for apple hunting, but DOWN puts direct pressure on his weak spot \u2013 his long body snaking left/down. He's at 7 apples, we're at 4 \u2013 we need to play dirty to force a mistake or trap him.\n\nSafety check for DOWN to (6,6):\n- On board: Yes, (6,6) valid.\n- Own body: No \u2013 body is (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6). (6,6) not in list.\n- Enemy body: No \u2013 starts at (8,6) down to (6,2). (6,6) clear.\n- Enemy head: If he goes UP, no collision. If he goes DOWN, he's at (9,5) \u2013 far from us. No head-on yet.\n- Apples: None at (6,6), but sets up for (7,6) or (6,5) next turn (careful of his body).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (6,6), turn 14 \u2013 go RIGHT to (7,6) to flank his body and head toward (8,8) apple. Monitor his head: if he's at (9,7), we can go UP to cut him off. Goal: Grow to 5 apples while forcing him into the right edge wall. If he traps himself, we win by score or survival. Stay aggressive \u2013 don't let him breathe!\n\nCHAT, we're pushing DOWN to squeeze him! Let's see him squirm! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Score is 4 vs 7 \u2013 we're behind, but the enemy is at the edge, and his body is snaking left/down. Let's close this gap aggressively!  \n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**  \n- **My Snake:** Head (6,6), Body [(6,7), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7)]. Apple count: 4.  \n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (9,5), Body [(9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. Apple count: 7. He's long and cornered at (9,5).  \n- **Board State:** From (6,6):  \n  - **UP to (6,7):** MY BODY \u2013 fatal backward move. \u274c  \n  - **DOWN to (6,5):** ENEMY BODY \u2013 deadly collision. \u274c  \n  - **LEFT to (5,6):** Safe? Row 5, col 6 \u2013 check: enemy body has (5,6)? No. Own body: (5,7), (5,8). Empty. Safe.  \n  - **RIGHT to (7,6):** Safe? Row 7, col 6 \u2013 no enemy body (enemy body at (7,5), (8,5), etc.). Own body: (6,7) etc. Empty. Safe.  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nEnemy at (9,5) \u2013 tight spot!  \n- **UP to (9,6):** Own body \u2013 suicide. Unlikely.  \n- **DOWN to (9,4):** Safe, but wall.  \n- **LEFT to (8,5):** Own body \u2013 suicide.  \n- **RIGHT to (10,5):** Off board \u2013 dead.  \nHe's forced UP or DOWN. If he goes UP to (9,6), he's safe. If DOWN to (9,4), he's safer. Either way, he's trapped near the edge.  \n\n**SAFE MOVE OPTIONS:**  \n- **LEFT to (5,6):** Moves toward his body (5,5) and (5,4). From there, we can go DOWN to (5,5) or RIGHT to (6,6) (but that's backtracking). Limited future moves.  \n- **RIGHT to (7,6):** Aggressive flank! From here, we can go RIGHT to (8,6) or UP to (7,7). (8,6) is his body \u2013 we can block or threaten. Also, apple at (8,8) is nearby. This keeps options OPEN and pushes toward his weak side.  \n\n**CHOOSING THE MOVE:**  \nWe're hunting! RIGHT to (7,6) is better than LEFT because it:  \n- Pressures his body directly (8,6, 7,5).  \n- Gives us multiple escape routes (UP, RIGHT, DOWN) and access to apple (8,8).  \n- Stays aggressive \u2013 we need to grow and force errors. If he goes DOWN, we can chase to (8,5) or (7,4).  \n\nSafety check:  \n- (7,6) on board: Yes.  \n- Own body: No.  \n- Enemy body: No (enemy at (7,5), (6,5)).  \n- Head-on risk: If he moves LEFT (suicide) or we both go to same cell? Unlikely.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (7,6), turn 15 \u2013 go RIGHT to (8,6) to cut off his escape. Monitor his head: if at (9,6), we UP to (8,7) to block. Goal: trap him against wall while we eat (8,8). Grow to 5 apples and force his death!  \n\nChat, we're flanking! Let's box him in! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca5  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\nRIGHT",

His possible moves:\n- **UP to (9,5):** SAFE - that's his current body segment but it's moving away\n- **DOWN to (9,3):** SAFE - empty\n- **LEFT to (8,4):** SAFE - empty\n- **RIGHT to (10,4):** OFF BOARD - DEAD\n\nHe'll likely go UP or LEFT to stay alive. If he goes UP, he's moving into (9,5) which was his previous body - but since his whole body shifts, that's actually safe for him.\n\n**My Safe Moves from (7,6):**\n1. **UP to (7,7):** SAFE? Check: (7,7) - empty, not in my body (I'm at (7,6), (6,6), etc.)\n2. **DOWN to (7,5):** DEAD - enemy body at (7,5) \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (6,6):** DEAD - my own body (next segment back) \u274c  \n4. **RIGHT to (8,6):** SAFE? Check: (8,6) - enemy body! DEAD \u274c\n\nWait... I need to reconsider. From (7,6):\n- **UP to (7,7):** Check coordinates: Enemy body has (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), etc. (7,7) looks clear. My body: (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8). (7,7) is empty. SAFE!\n- **DOWN to (7,5):** Enemy has (7,5) - that's his body. DEAD.\n- **LEFT to (6,6):** That's my own body (head was at (6,6) last turn). DEAD.\n- **RIGHT to (8,6):** Enemy has (8,6) in his body. DEAD.\n\nActually only UP seems safe... but wait, let me double-check the board state from the prompt:\nBoard shows at row 6: \" . . . . . . T 0 T T \"\nSo (7,6) is 0 (me), (8,6) is T (enemy), (9,6) is T (enemy).\n\n**REVISED SAFE MOVES:**\n- **UP to (7,7):** Row 7 shows: \" . . . . A . T . . . \"\n  So (7,7) is \"T\"? Wait no, let me count columns:\n  Row 7: Col0:., Col1:., Col2:., Col3:., Col4:A, Col5:., Col6:T, Col7:., Col8:., Col9:.\n  So (7,7) is Col7 = \".\" = EMPTY! SAFE!\n- **DOWN to (7,5):** Row 5: \" . . . . . . T T T T \"\n  Col7 = \"T\" = enemy body. DEAD.\n- **LEFT to (6,6):** That's where my head WAS. My body now: (7,6) head, (6,6) next. So moving left into my own body. DEAD.\n- **RIGHT to (8,6):** Row 6, Col8 = \"T\" = enemy. DEAD.\n\n**ONLY SAFE MOVE: UP to (7,7)**\n\nBut wait... what about enemy's move? If I go UP to (7,7) and he goes LEFT to (8,4) or UP to (9,5), there's no collision. If he goes DOWN to (9,3), no issue.\n\n**STRATEGY:** I'm forced UP. From (7,7), I'll have options: LEFT to (6,7) but that's in my body? Let me think ahead.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FROM (7,7):**\n- From (7,7), I can go LEFT to (6,7) - but (6,7) is currently my body (second segment). However, by next turn, my body will have shifted. Let's simulate:\n  - Current body: [ (7,6) head, (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8) ]\n  - If I move UP to (7,7): New body = [ (7,7) head, (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8) ]\n  - So from (7,7), LEFT to (6,7) would be into my OLD body position (6,7) which is now the 3rd segment, not immediate death? Wait no - if (6,7) is in the new body list, it's deadly.\n\nActually, from (7,7) after moving there:\n- New body: [ (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8) ]\n- So (6,7) is in the body (3rd segment) - moving into it would be death.\n\nFrom (7,7), safe future moves might be:\n- RIGHT to (8,7): Check if (8,7) is safe - row 8: \" . . . . . . T T . A \" so Col7 = \"T\"? Wait Row8: \" . . . . . . T T . A \"\n  Col7 = \"T\" (enemy at (8,7)? Actually board shows at row8: after (8,6) and (8,5) are T, then (8,7) is also T? Let me read row8 carefully:\n  Row8: \" . . . . . . T T . A \"\n  That's: col0 ., col1 ., col2 ., col3 ., col4 ., col5 ., col6 T, col7 T, col8 ., col9 A\n  So (8,7) is T = enemy body. DEAD.\n\n- DOWN to (7,6): That's my current head position, will be my body next turn. DEAD.\n\n- UP to (7,8): Row7, Col8 = \".\" = empty. SAFE!\n\nSo from (7,7), only UP to (7,8) seems safe initially. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT to (6,8) which is currently my tail but will be empty next turn.\n\n**MY MOVE: UP** - it's the only safe choice, and it positions me to potentially go toward the apple at (8,8) or flank the enemy.\n\n**FINAL DECISION: UP**",

I need to be AGGRESSIVE and box him in! \ud83d\udca5**\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (7,7), body: [(7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)]\n- Enemy head: (9,3), body: [(9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5)]\n- Board: I have apples nearby at (8,8) and (3,9), but I need to focus on the enemy!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 is at (9,3). Possible moves:\n- **UP to (9,4):** That's his own body (currently his 2nd segment) - but by next turn, his body shifts, so it becomes SAFE! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **DOWN to (9,2):** Currently empty, SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (8,3):** Currently empty, SAFE!\n- **RIGHT:** Off board, DEAD!\n\nHe'll likely go UP or LEFT to stay in the game. If he goes UP, he's moving up the right edge. If he goes LEFT, he's moving toward the center.\n\n**MY SAFE MOVES FROM (7,7):**\n1. **UP to (7,8):** Check board: Row 8 shows \" . . . . . . T T . A \" \u2192 (7,8) is \"T\"? Wait, let me count: col0 ., col1 ., col2 ., col3 ., col4 ., col5 ., col6 T, col7 T, col8 ., col9 A. So (7,8) is col7 = \"T\" = enemy body! DEAD! \u274c\n   *Wait, I need to check row 8 more carefully. The board shows:*\n   Row 8: \" . . . . . . T T . A \"\n   That's: (8,0) ., (8,1) ., (8,2) ., (8,3) ., (8,4) ., (8,5) ., (8,6) T, (8,7) T, (8,8) ., (8,9) A\n   So (7,8) is row 7, col 8. Row 7: \" . . . . A . T . . . \"\n   Row 7: (7,0) ., (7,1) ., (7,2) ., (7,3) ., (7,4) A, (7,5) ., (7,6) T, (7,7) 0, (7,8) ., (7,9) .\n   So (7,8) is EMPTY! SAFE! \u2705\n\n2. **DOWN to (7,6):** That's my current body (the segment behind my head). DEAD! \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to (6,7):** Check if it's in my body. My current body: [(7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)]. (6,7) IS in my body! DEAD! \u274c\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8,7):** Check board: Row 8 shows (8,7) is \"T\" = enemy body! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**WAIT! Only ONE safe move: UP to (7,8)!!**\n\nBut let me double-check: From (7,7), UP goes to (7,8). Is (7,8) in my future body? After I move, my new body will be: [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)] - so (7,8) is NEW head, not in body. And from board state, (7,8) is empty. So UP is SAFE!\n\n**ENEMY COLLISION CHECK:**\nIf I go UP to (7,8) and he goes UP to (9,4): No collision (different positions).\nIf he goes LEFT to (8,3): No collision.\nIf he goes DOWN to (9,2): No collision.\n\n**STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE:**\nFrom (7,8), I can potentially:\n- Go LEFT to (6,8) - but that's currently my tail (6,8), will be empty next turn? Let's see: my new body after moving UP: [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)]. So (6,8) is NOT in my body anymore! It becomes free! \u2705\n- From (7,8), I can also go RIGHT to (8,8) which has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nBut first, I need to survive this turn. UP is my ONLY option! CHAT, WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO UP! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After reaching (7,8), I'll likely go RIGHT to (8,8) to eat the apple and grow to 5 apples, then try to flank the enemy from the top. The enemy is at (9,3) - if I can get above him and trap him against the wall, I can force a collision when I have more apples! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**DECISION: UP** is the only move that keeps me alive. LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

He played it safe and avoided his own body. Smart.\n- **Enemy Body:** [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5)] \u2014 Still a threat.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (FROM MY VIEW):**\n- **Apple at (8,8) is RIGHT next to me!** \ud83c\udf4e That's my immediate target. I can go RIGHT and eat it to grow to 5 apples!\n- **Enemy is at (9,2)** \u2014 still on the right edge. If I go RIGHT to (8,8), I'm actually moving AWAY from him for now, but setting up a flanking position from the top-right.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FOR RIGHT MOVE (to 8,8):**\n1. **Is (8,8) empty?** YES! Board shows (8,8) is empty (row 8: ...T T . A, so col8 is .).\n2. **Is it my own body?** No, my body is at [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)] \u2014 all different.\n3. **Is it enemy body?** Enemy is at (9,2) and body occupies: (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5). (8,8) is NOT in that list. SAFE!\n4. **Will I hit myself next turn?** After moving to (8,8), my new body will be [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)]. The tail (6,6) will drop off next turn if I don't eat. That's fine.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (9,2) has options:\n- **UP to (9,3):** That's his OLD body (currently his head's segment behind). But after he moves, his body shifts, so (9,3) becomes SAFE for him? Wait, let's simulate: If he moves UP to (9,3), his new body would be [(9,3), (9,2), (9,3), ...] \u2014 OH WAIT! He'd be moving into his own future body! Actually, (9,3) is currently his first body segment. Since he moves SIMULTANEOUSLY, his head goes to (9,3) while his old head (9,2) becomes part of his body. But his old first body segment (9,3) shifts to (9,4). So the cell (9,3) is being vacated by his body at the same time he moves into it. That's ALLOWED in Snake games \u2014 you can move into a cell your body just left if you're moving forward. So UP is possible.\n- **LEFT to (8,2):** Empty currently? Board row 2: \"A A . A . . . . . 1\" \u2014 row 2 shows (8,2) is \".\" (empty). SAFE.\n- **DOWN to (9,1):** Row 1: \". A . . . . . . A .\" \u2014 (9,1) is \".\" (empty). SAFE.\n- **RIGHT:** Off board, DEAD.\n\nHe's likely to go LEFT toward the center or UP to stay high. Not directly toward me yet.\n\n**MY STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE:**\n- Eating the apple at (8,8) gives me +1 apple (5 total) and grows my body. I need to catch up to his 7 apples!\n- From (8,8), I can control the top-right quadrant. The enemy is on the right edge at (9,2). I can potentially flank him from above or cut him off.\n- **CRITICAL:** If I go RIGHT and eat the apple, my body length increases, making me more dangerous. If he tries to head-on collide later, I might have the size advantage.\n- **SAFETY FIRST:** RIGHT is safe this turn. LEFT is into my own body (6,7 is my tail). DOWN is (7,7) which is my own body (head's previous spot). UP to (7,9) is empty? Let's check: row 9 is top row: \"9 . . . A . . . . . .\" \u2014 (7,9) is \".\" (empty). But that's moving away from the apple and doesn't gain me points. RIGHT is better because it grows me.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- If I go RIGHT to (8,8), enemy moves simultaneously. Could he move into my path? His possible moves from (9,2) to (8,2), (9,3), (9,1). None of those are (8,8). No collision risk.\n- Could I trap him later? From (8,8), I can threaten to go DOWN to (8,7) or LEFT to (7,8). (8,7) is currently empty. (7,8) is my current head position, which will be my body after I move. So from (8,8), my future options are: UP to (8,9) (apple! Row 9 col8 is \".\" actually, row 9 col8 is \".\" \u2014 wait row 9: col0 ., col1 ., col2 ., col3 A, col4 ., col5 ., col6 ., col7 ., col8 ., col9 . \u2014 so (8,9) is col8? No, row 9 is y=9. So (8,9) is row 9, col8 = \".\" empty). So UP to (8,9) is safe and empty. LEFT to (7,8) will be my own body after I move (since I'm moving from (7,8) to (8,8), (7,8) becomes body). DOWN to (8,7) is empty. RIGHT off board. So from (8,8) I have 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- **Next 2-3 turns:** Eat apple at (8,8) to grow. Then from (8,8), consider going UP to (8,9) to reach another apple at (9,0)? Wait (9,0) is far. Actually, from (8,8), I can go UP to (8,9) (empty), then RIGHT to (9,9) (empty), then DOWN along the right wall to (9,0) where there's an apple! That's a path to more apples while staying near the enemy's edge.\n- **Trapping Strategy:** Enemy is on the right edge. If I can get to (9,8) or (9,9), I can block his escape up the wall. But first, I need to grow and gain apples. He has 7, I have 4. I need to catch up!\n- **Aggression:** If I can get ahead in apples (say, 6 vs 7), I might force a head-on collision later. But right now, I'm behind. Grow first, trap later.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- **RIGHT** to (8,8) is SAFE, grows me, and advances my position toward the top-right corner where I can dominate.\n- Other moves: UP to (7,9) is safe but doesn't gain apples. LEFT and DOWN are deadly. RIGHT is the only move that scores and sets up future offense.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO! EAT THAT APPLE AND SHOW THE ENEMY WHO'S BOSS! \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e**\n\nRIGHT",

LET'S ANALYZE THIS QUICK! \ud83d\udd25**\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (8,8) \u2014 I just moved RIGHT into the apple! \ud83c\udf4e **SCORE INCREASED TO 6!** Let's GOOO!\n- **My New Body:** [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7)] \u2014 tail at (6,7).\n- **Enemy Head:** (9,1) \u2014 He moved DOWN from (9,2) to (9,1). Still on the right edge.\n- **Enemy Body:** [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5)] \u2014 same body, shifted.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (FROM TOP-RIGHT VIEW):**\n- **Apple at (8,9)?** Let's check: Row 9 shows (col8 is \".\") \u2014 yes, (8,9) is empty! No apple there, but it's a safe spot to move toward.\n- **Apple at (9,0) is far below.** Enemy is at (9,1) \u2014 he's near that apple! If I can get to (9,9) or (9,8), I might cut him off from the top.\n- **My current position:** (8,8) is a commanding spot! I control the top-right corner. From here, I can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT (RIGHT is off board).\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FOR POTENTIAL MOVES:**\n- **UP to (8,9):** Empty? Yes! Row 9 col8 is \".\" (safe). Not my body (my body: (8,8), (7,8)...). Not enemy body (enemy at (9,1) etc.).\n- **DOWN to (8,7):** Empty? Row 7 shows \"A . . . . A . T T . .\" \u2014 (8,7) is \".\" (safe). Not my body. Not enemy body.\n- **LEFT to (7,8):** This is my OLD head position, which is now part of my body! Moving LEFT would hit my own body (7,8) \u2014 **DEADLY!**\n- **RIGHT:** Off board (x=10) \u2014 **DEADLY!**\n\nSo **LEFT and RIGHT are deadly!** Only UP and DOWN are safe!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (9,1) has options:\n- **UP to (9,2):** That's his old head position (now his body). Safe for him (his body will shift).\n- **DOWN to (9,0):** That's an apple! (9,0) is listed in apples. He'll probably eat it!\n- **LEFT to (8,1):** Row 1 shows (8,1) is \".\" (safe).\n- **RIGHT:** Off board.\n\nHe's likely to go DOWN to eat the apple and grow to 8 apples! That puts him further ahead.\n\n**MY STRATEGY NOW:**\n- I'm at 6 apples, he's at 7. **I need to catch up!** But there's no apple directly reachable from my current position (UP/DOWN to empty squares). However, moving UP to (8,9) positions me to potentially go to (9,9) next turn, then DOWN along the wall to chase apples at (9,0) or (8,0) etc.\n- **Trapping:** From (8,9), I can threaten to block the top edge. Enemy is at (9,1) \u2014 if he goes UP, he'll be at (9,2), still on the wall. If I get to (9,9), I can move DOWN to (9,8), (9,7)... potentially colliding with his body if he stays on the wall.\n- **Immediate Safety:** UP to (8,9) gives me more options (UP again to (8,9)? no, that's same, LEFT to (7,9), DOWN to (8,8) which will be my body). DOWN to (8,7) gives options LEFT to (7,7) (which will be my body), UP to (8,8) (my body), DOWN to (8,6). (8,6) is currently enemy body! (Enemy body includes (8,6)). So if I go DOWN to (8,7), then next turn DOWN to (8,6) is deadly! That limits my downward path.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- **UP to (8,9)** is safer long-term. From there, I can move LEFT to (7,9) or UP again to (8,9)? No, same. Actually, from (8,9), I can move LEFT to (7,9) (empty), DOWN to (8,8) (my body), RIGHT to (9,9) (empty). (9,9) is empty and is the top-right corner. That's a great position to dominate the right wall.\n- **DOWN to (8,7)** leads to a dead end because (8,6) is enemy body. If I go DOWN now, next turn I might be forced into (8,6) and die.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Enemy likely eats apple at (9,0) and grows to 8. I'm at 6. I need to grow too, but first I need to position myself to survive and eventually trap him.\n- **UP** keeps me alive, gives me the high ground, and lets me chase apples later (there's an apple at (9,0) but that's far; maybe (3,9) or (4,7) in the center? But I'm focusing on enemy position).\n- If I go UP, enemy might go DOWN to eat, then we'll be farther apart, which is fine for now. I'll dominate the top.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- Move UP to (8,9). Next turn, consider RIGHT to (9,9) to block the top-right corner. Then from (9,9), move DOWN along the right wall to (9,8), (9,7)... threatening enemy's space. If he's on the right edge, I can cut him off and force a collision where I have the advantage (maybe I'll have more apples by then?).\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP is the move! It's safe, opens up the top edge, and sets up future aggression.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO! UP WE GO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d**\n\nUP",

Danger zone!\n- **Apple at (9,0)** \u2014 Enemy just ate this! He's growing.\n- **Most apples are clustered in the center** \u2014 (4,4), (7,4), (0,4), (3,2), (4,7), (5,5). But I'm focused on **enemy position first**.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FOR MOVES FROM (8,9):**\n- **UP:** Off board (y=10) \u2014 **DEADLY!** \u274c\n- **DOWN to (8,8):** This is my own body! (8,8) is currently my neck. Moving down would hit myself \u2014 **DEADLY!** \u274c\n- **LEFT to (7,9):** Row 9 shows (7,9) is \".\" (empty). Not my body (my body: (8,8), (7,8)...). Not enemy body (enemy body is all x=9 or x=8,y=5-6). **SAFE!** \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (9,9):** Off board? Wait, (9,9) is valid! Board is 0-9. (9,9) is top-right corner. Row 9 shows (9,9) is \"0\" \u2014 that's ME! Actually, (9,9) is empty in the board state (row 9: \" . . . A . . . A 0 .\" \u2014 the \"0\" is at (8,9)). So (9,9) is \".\" (empty). Not my body. Not enemy body. **SAFE!** \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n**Option 1: LEFT to (7,9)**\n- **Pros:** Moves me away from the right edge where enemy is. Gets me closer to apple at (3,9). Keeps me in top row where I can dominate.\n- **Cons:** Enemy is at bottom-right, far away. Might not be aggressive enough.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (9,9)**\n- **Pros:** Takes the top-right corner! I become the king of the right wall. From (9,9), I can move DOWN along the wall (9,8), (9,7)... directly threatening enemy's space. If he's on the right edge, I can cut him off and potentially force a collision where I have the positional advantage.\n- **Cons:** Getting closer to enemy who's on the right edge. But he's at bottom, I'm at top \u2014 plenty of space.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (9,0) just ate an apple. Where can he go?\n- **UP to (9,1):** His own body! (9,1) is currently his neck. Moving UP would hit himself \u2014 **DEADLY for him!** Unless he wants to die? But he's smart.\n- **DOWN:** Off board (y=-1) \u2014 **DEADLY!**\n- **LEFT to (8,0):** (8,0) is empty (row 0: \". . . A . . . . . A 1\" \u2014 (8,0) is \".\"). Safe!\n- **RIGHT:** Off board \u2014 **DEADLY!**\n\n**Enemy only has ONE safe move: LEFT to (8,0)!** He has no choice! That puts him at (8,0), and he'll grow (since he just ate). This is perfect!\n\n**MY ADVANTAGE:** \n- If I go RIGHT to (9,9), I'll be at the top-right corner while he's forced to (8,0). \n- Next turn, I can move DOWN to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7)... heading right for his tail!\n- I'm at 6 apples, he's at 8. If I can trap him or force a collision where I have the advantage (maybe I'll eat an apple soon), I win.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Going LEFT to (7,9) is safe but doesn't set up aggression. I'll just be wandering the top row.\n- Going RIGHT to (9,9) puts me in a **DOMINANT POSITION** to control the right wall and chase the enemy. \n- **CRITICAL:** From (9,9), if the enemy goes to (8,0), we're far apart. But if he ever goes UP along the wall, I can meet him head-on. Since I have fewer apples, I want to avoid head-on collisions for now. But I can force him into a corner!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (9,9) to claim the right edge. Then move DOWN along the wall (9,8), (9,7), etc., to chase the enemy. If he's forced left into the board, I can cut him off from the right side. By the time I meet him, I might have eaten more apples and be closer in score. If I can trap him in a corner or force him into my body, I win. **AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING!**\n\n**DECISION:**\n**RIGHT to (9,9)!** Take the corner! Set up the chase!

WE'RE ON TURN 20 AND IT'S TIME TO PUSH THE ADVANTAGE!** \ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's break down the fresh situation:\n\n**MY CURRENT STATE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (9,9) - top-right corner\n- Body: [(8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)]\n- Apples: 5\n\n**ENEMY STATE (ID 1):**\n- Head: (8,0) - bottom, moving left from previous turn\n- Body: [(9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5)]\n- Apples: 9\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at the board, I'm at (9,9) and the enemy is at (8,0). The right edge (x=9) has my body from (8,9) down to (7,6) and the enemy's body from (9,0) to (9,6). The center is open with apples scattered.\n\n**MOVEMENT SAFETY CHECK FROM (9,9):**\n\n1. **UP:** (9,10) - OFF BOARD! \u274c DEADLY - can't go up from top row\n2. **DOWN:** (9,8) - Is this safe? \n   - (9,8) isn't in my body: my body is (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)\n   - (9,8) isn't enemy body: enemy body is at (9,0-6), (8,6), (8,5)\n   - Board shows (9,8) as \"T\" - but that's MY tail! Wait no... my tail is (7,6). The \"T\" at (9,8) in the board state is actually... hmm, let me re-read the board:\n   \n   ```\n   9 . . . A . A . A T 0\n   ```\n   The \"T\" at position 9 in row 9 is (9,9)? No wait... the board shows:\n   Row 9: positions 0-9: \".\" \".\" \".\" \"A\" \".\" \"A\" \".\" \"A\" \"T\" \"0\"\n   So (9,8) = \"T\" and (9,9) = \"0\" (my head).\n   \n   But looking at my body list: [(8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)] - my tail is (7,6)!\n   That \"T\" at (9,8) must be... wait, that's confusing. Let me check the body positions again.\n   \n   My body: (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)\n   So (9,8) should be empty according to my body list!\n   \n   But the board shows (9,8) as \"T\". Maybe there's a discrepancy, or maybe that's an old tail marker?\n   \n   Actually, looking more carefully at the board:\n   Row 8: \". . . . . . . T T .\" - this means (8,7) and (8,8) are \"T\"\n   Row 7: \". . . . A . . T . .\" - (7,7) is \"T\"\n   \n   This suggests the board might be showing where snakes were, but let me trust the body lists more precisely.\n   \n   My body at (8,8) would show on row 8, position 8 as \"T\". Yes, row 8 shows \"T\" at position 8. That matches!\n   \n   For (9,8): Row 9 shows \"T\" at position 8. That would be (9,8). But my body doesn't include (9,8)... \n   \n   Wait, I think I need to re-examine. The board state might be showing the CURRENT state including all bodies.\n   \n   Let me check: If my body is [(8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)], then:\n   - (8,9) would be at row 9, col 8\n   - (8,8) would be at row 8, col 8\n   - (7,8) would be at row 8, col 7\n   - (7,7) would be at row 7, col 7\n   - (7,6) would be at row 6, col 7\n   \n   The board shows:\n   Row 9: ... (col 8 = \"T\", col 9 = \"0\")\n   Row 8: ... (col 7 = \"T\", col 8 = \"T\")\n   Row 7: ... (col 7 = \"T\")\n   \n   This matches perfectly! So (9,8) is NOT my body - that \"T\" at row 9, col 8 must be... wait no, let me recount the columns.\n   \n   Row 9: \". . . A . A . A T 0\"\n   Columns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n   So at col 8: \"T\", col 9: \"0\"\n   \n   But my head is at (9,9) and my body at (8,9) - that's col 9, row 8. So (9,9) is head \"0\", (8,9) would be... row 9, col 8? No, coordinates are (x,y) where x is column, y is row.\n   \n   Oh! I need to be careful with coordinate system.\n   - (x,y) where x is horizontal (0-9 left to right), y is vertical (0-9 bottom to top)\n   - So (9,9) means x=9 (rightmost column), y=9 (top row)\n   - In the board display, rows go from top (y=9) to bottom (y=0)\n   \n   So row 9 (top row) shows y=9. Columns 0-9 show x=0-9.\n   At (9,9): x=9, y=9 \u2192 row 9, col 9 \u2192 shows \"0\" \u2713\n   \n   My body at (8,9): x=8, y=9 \u2192 row 9, col 8 \u2192 shows \"T\" \u2713\n   \n   So the board is correct! And (9,8) would be x=9, y=8 \u2192 row 8, col 9. Row 8 shows: \". . . . . . . T T .\" so col 9 is \".\" (empty).\n   \n   **So DOWN to (9,8) is SAFE!** It's empty and not in my body or enemy body.\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,9):** \n   - (8,9) is currently my body (neck)! Moving left would hit my own body - DEADLY! \u274c\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,9):** \n   - OFF BOARD! x=10 is invalid (max 9) - DEADLY! \u274c\n\n**ONLY SAFE MOVE: DOWN to (9,8)**\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nFrom (9,8), I'll be one step down the right edge. The enemy is at (8,0) - bottom-left area. \n- From (9,8), I can continue down to (9,7), (9,6), etc., potentially chasing down the right side.\n- The enemy just moved LEFT to (8,0) - they're forced that way by their own body blocking (9,1) and walls blocking other directions.\n- I'm at 5 apples, they're at 9. I need to play smart and aggressive.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe only safe move that keeps me alive is DOWN. It also positions me to continue controlling the right edge and potentially cut off the enemy's escape routes. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep moving down the right edge (9,8 \u2192 9,7 \u2192 9,6...) to assert dominance on the right wall. The enemy is trapped on the left/bottom with their long body. Once I'm lower down, I can turn left into the board and start cutting off their space or going for apples while keeping them contained. If I can trap them between my body and the walls, they'll crash into me!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is climbing up the left side with a massive body that's blocking their own escape. I need to stay alive and keep options open. Once I'm lower (around y=5-6), I can turn left and start cutting off their space. They have 10 apples, I have 5 - I need to be smart and aggressive!\n\n**NEXT FEW MOVES MENTAL MAP:**\n(9,8) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 (9,6) \u2192 (9,5) \u2192 turn LEFT toward center... \n\n**FINAL DECISION:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

DEAD. \u274c\n\n**TWO SAFE MOVES: DOWN or LEFT.** Which gives me the trap?\n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICE:**\n- **LEFT to (6, 7)** puts me directly between enemy and the right edge. Their body is stretched from (6,1) to (9,5). If I go LEFT, I can cut off their escape path and potentially box them against the right wall.\n- **DOWN to (7, 6)** is safer but less aggressive. It keeps me in the center while enemy is on the left. Not optimal for trapping.\n\n**LONG-TERM TRAP PLAN:**\n- Turn 24: LEFT to (6, 7) \u2014 cut off enemy's right-side access\n- Turn 25: LEFT to (5, 7) \u2014 get closer to enemy's head at (5, 1)\n- Turn 26: DOWN to (5, 6) \u2014 position to threaten head-on collision (I have 5 vs 10 apples, but if I grow once more and force collision, I might win if we tie!)\n- Turn 27: If enemy tries to escape right, I can move RIGHT to block their path while their body is still stretched.\n\n**THE TRAP IS SET!** Enemy is on the left with a long body. I'm cutting off their right flank. They'll be forced to turn into themselves or hit my body.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT \u2014 Time to box them in!\n\nLEFT",

DEAD. \u274c\n\n**THREE SAFE MOVES:** UP, DOWN, LEFT (with apple!).\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT to (4, 7):** This moves me onto an apple (growing to 6) AND positions me at (4, 7) \u2014 right above their potential path! This could cut off their upward escape if they go UP this turn. Plus, I get a point!\n- **UP to (5, 8):** Safe but no apple. Moves me closer to the top-right apples (7,9), (5,9) but away from the enemy. Less aggressive.\n- **DOWN to (5, 6):** Safe but no apple. Moves me away from the enemy and into the center. Not optimal for trapping.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n- **THIS TURN:** LEFT to (4, 7) \u2014 eat the apple (now 6 apples!), position to block enemy's upward movement if they go UP from (3,1) to (3,2). Their body at (3,2) is already occupied by their own tail? Wait... looking at board: (3,2) shows \"A\" in apple list, but enemy tail is at (9,3) down to (8,0)? Actually enemy body goes from head (3,1) down through (4,1),(5,1)... to (9,0) and (9,1),(9,2),(9,3). So (3,2) is NOT their body \u2014 it's an apple! If enemy goes UP to (3,2), they'd eat that apple and grow. But I'd be at (4,7) \u2014 still threatening.\n- **NEXT TURN:** Depending on enemy move, I can move DOWN to (4,6) to cut off their bottom escape or stay LEFT to threaten (3,7) if they go RIGHT. Their long body is a liability!\n\n**TRAP OPPORTUNITY:** Their head at (3,1) is near the left wall. If I can push them left/up, they might crash into their own body or the wall. My position at (4,7) lets me pivot to either chase them or block.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT \u2014 Grow to 6 apples AND position for maximum aggression!

We need to play AGGRESSIVE and box them in! Let's break this down.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS (CURRENT HEAD AT 3,7):**\n- **My Body:** (4,7) to (9,7) straight line + (9,8) at the tail. \n- **Enemy Head:** (2,2) with body going (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)... all the way to (9,2). They're near the bottom-left corner.\n- **Apples:** (3,9), (7,9), (5,9) up top; (1,1), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2), (4,4), (7,4), (0,4), (5,5), (2,8), (8,8), (8,4) scattered. Plenty to eat!\n\n**MOVEMENT SAFETY CHECK (FROM 3,7):**\n1. **UP to (3,8):** Board shows \".\" (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. SAFE! \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (3,6):** Board shows \".\" (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. SAFE! \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (2,7):** Board shows \".\" (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. SAFE! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (4,7):** MY BODY! (4,7) is my first body segment. DEAD. \u274c\n\n**THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, LEFT.**\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\n- **UP to (3,8):** Moves me toward the top row apples (3,9), (2,8). Gets me closer to high-value targets and away from enemy's long body line. This also positions me to potentially trap them from above if they go UP later.\n- **DOWN to (3,6):** Moves me toward center but directly above their head (2,2). Risky if they go UP to (2,3) this turn\u2014we'd be adjacent but not colliding. Could set up a chase.\n- **LEFT to (2,7):** Moves me to the left edge, directly above their entire vertical line (3,2) to (3,1). This is AGGRESSIVE positioning but might limit my escape routes if they go RIGHT toward their body.\n\n**THE TRAP PLAN:**\nWe need to HERD Snake #1! They're boxed in by the left wall and their own long body. If I go **UP to (3,8)**, I:\n1. Move toward apples on top row.\n2. Avoid getting too close to their head immediately (let's them make a move first).\n3. Keep multiple safe paths open for next turn (RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT).\n4. Position to potentially cut off their escape if they try to go UP toward (2,3) or (1,3).\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** Keep Snake #1 confined to the bottom-left quadrant. Use my body to block their paths while I feast on top-row apples. If they make a move into a dead-end, we close the trap and force a collision on OUR terms.\n\n**DECISION:** **UP!** \ud83d\ude80 Let's grab those top apples and set up the ultimate ambush.\n\nUP",

Snake #1 is long and slow\u2014we need to force a head-on collision while we're winning that exchange. Let's analyze this board!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Head at (3,8)**: Just moved UP from (3,7). Good position on the left side of the board.\n- **My Body**: Spans from (3,7) to (8,7) plus tail at (9,8). I'm creating a wall on row 7!\n- **Enemy Head at (1,2)**: Their body is a long line stretching from (3,2) to (9,2) and down to (9,0). They're trapped in the bottom-left corner by their own body and the wall.\n- **Apples Nearby**: (3,9) above me, (2,8) to my left, (5,9) to my right. Good food options!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (3,8):**\n1. **UP to (3,9)**: Board shows \"A\" (apple). Not in my body (my body is at y=7-8). Not in enemy body (they're at y\u22642). SAFE! \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (3,7)**: MY BODY! That's my first body segment. DEAD! \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (2,8)**: Board shows \"A\" (apple). Not in my body. Not in enemy body (they're at x\u22651, y\u22642). SAFE! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (4,8)**: Board shows \".\" (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. SAFE! \u2705\n\n**THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n**STRATEGIC RATIONALE:**\n- **UP to (3,9)**: Grab the apple immediately and position directly above their entire horizontal body line (they're at y=2, I'll be at y=9). This gives me massive board control from above. If they go UP (to 1,3 or 2,3), I can potentially drop down to cut them off.\n- **LEFT to (2,8)**: Grab apple there, but moves me toward the left wall. Might limit my escape routes if they chase upward.\n- **RIGHT to (4,8)**: Opens up right side movement toward (5,9) apple next turn, but doesn't grab food immediately.\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY:**\nI need to **UP** to grab that apple at (3,9). Here's why this is the WINNING MOVE:\n1. **IMMEDIATE POINT**: +1 apple, score becomes 7-12. Still down but closing gap.\n2. **POSITIONING DOMINANCE**: Being at y=9 with my body at y=7 creates a HUGE vertical barrier. Snake #1 is at y=2 with a long horizontal line\u2014they can't go UP past y=2 without hitting their own body or the wall. I control the top!\n3. **HERDING SETUP**: If they try to escape upward, they're trapped. If they go LEFT/WALL, they're dead. If they go DOWN, they might crash into themselves.\n4. **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK**: If they try to move RIGHT toward their body line, and I drop down on future turns, we could force a collision where I have fewer apples but better position. Actually, with them at 12 apples vs my 6, head-on would ME lose. Wait, no\u2014head-on collision KILLS BOTH. So I don't want that yet. I need to get more apples first.\n5. **MULTIPLE NEXT MOVES**: From (3,9) I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (to 3,8 again). All safe. Keeps options open.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat upward apples to grow. Use my body to create a vertical wall from x=3 to x=8 at y=7-9. Force Snake #1 into the bottom-left dead zone where they have no escape. Let them choke on their own body length. Once I have more apples than them, THEN force the collision.\n\n**DECISION: UP!** Time to feast and dominate the top row! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Let's break this down.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS FROM (3,9):**\n- **My Head at (3,9)**: Just moved UP. Currently at the top row.\n- **My Body**: Starts at (3,8), goes down to (3,7), then right to (8,7). I have a solid vertical wall at x=3 from y=7-9.\n- **Enemy Head at (1,1)**: Long body stretching from (1,2) down to (9,2) then down to (9,0). They're trapped in the bottom-left corner! Their body forms a horizontal line at y=2 from x=1 to x=9.\n- **Apples**: (2,8), (5,9), (8,8), (8,9) are nearby. (8,9) is especially juicy since I'm at the top row.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (3,9):**\n1. **UP to (3,10)**: OFF THE BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (3,8)**: MY BODY! That's my first body segment. DEAD! \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (2,9)**: Board shows \".\" (empty). Not in my body (my body is at x\u22653). Not in enemy body (they're at y\u22642). SAFE! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Board shows \".\" (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. SAFE! \u2705\n\n**TWO SAFE MOVES: LEFT or RIGHT.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n- **LEFT to (2,9)**: Moves me toward (2,8) apple, but (2,9) is empty. From there, I can go DOWN to (2,8) next turn to grab that apple. This keeps me on the left side.\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Moves me toward (5,9) apple. From (4,9) I can go RIGHT to (5,9) next turn to grab it. This opens up the entire top-right section for me.\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY: RIGHT!**\nHere's why this is the WINNING MOVE:\n1. **POSITIONING DOMINANCE**: Moving RIGHT to (4,9) positions me directly above my own body wall at y=7. This creates a horizontal wall across the top that Snake #1 (at y=2) cannot cross without crashing into themselves.\n2. **ESCAPE ROUTES**: From (4,9), I have LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN as safe moves (DOWN to (4,8) which is empty). LEFT option to (2,8) apple still available. RIGHT option to (5,9) apple open. Maximum flexibility.\n3. **HERDING ENEMY**: Snake #1 is stuck at y=2. If they try to go UP, they have to go through their own body or the wall. I control the entire top section. They're boxed in the bottom!\n4. **APPLE ACCESS**: (5,9) is the closest apple to my right. (8,9) is also reachable after that. The left side has apples too, but the right side gives me more board control.\n5. **LONG-TERM PLAN**: Right now, I'm building a horizontal wall at y=9. Snake #1 is trapped at y=2. I need to eat more apples to close the 13-7 gap. Once I have equal or more apples, I can start closing the vertical distance and force a collision where I win.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE TURNS:**\nGrab (5,9) next turn. Then work toward (8,9) and (8,8). Create a horizontal barrier at y=9-8. Force Snake #1 to stay in their bottom-left dead zone. Grow as much as possible before initiating any confrontation. When I have 12+ apples, then I can consider dropping down to cut them off.\n\n**DECISION: RIGHT!** Let's claim the top-right corner! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25",

Let's lock in the win.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS FROM (4,9):**\n- **My Head at (4,9)**: Just moved RIGHT.\n- **My Body**: [(3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. I have a solid vertical wall at x=3 from y=7-9 and a horizontal wall at y=7 from x=4-7.\n- **Enemy Head at (1,1)**: Their body stretches to (9,0). They're still trapped in the bottom-left. Their body line is at y=2 from x=1 to x=9. They cannot go UP without crashing.\n- **Apples**: (5,9) is directly to my RIGHT. (8,9) and (8,8) are also in the top-right. (2,8) is on the left side. (5,5) and (8,4) are middle-right.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (4,9):**\n1. **UP to (4,10)**: OFF THE BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n2. **LEFT to (3,9)**: MY BODY! First body segment.

SAFE! \u2705\n\n**TWO SAFE MOVES: DOWN or RIGHT.** Both hit apples!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n- **DOWN to (4,8)**: Hits apple at (4,8). From there, I can go DOWN to (4,7) but that's my body. LEFT to (3,8) is my body. RIGHT to (5,8) is empty. UP to (4,9) is empty. So I'd have RIGHT and UP as safe moves.\n- **RIGHT to (5,9)**: Hits apple at (5,9). From there, I can go LEFT to (4,9), RIGHT to (6,9), or DOWN to (5,8). All three are empty. That's more options!\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY: RIGHT!**\nHere's why this is the WINNING MOVE:\n1. **MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY**: RIGHT gives me THREE safe follow-up moves (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). DOWN only gives TWO (RIGHT, UP). More space = more freedom.\n2. **BOARD CONTROL**: (5,9) is further RIGHT, extending my horizontal reach. I'm claiming the entire top-right quadrant. Snake #1 is stuck at y=2\u2014I own the top!\n3. **APPLE ACCESS**: (5,9) is a direct apple. Next, I can go RIGHT to (6,9), then toward (8,9) and (8,8). The right side is stacked with apples.\n4. **HERDING**: By going RIGHT, I'm moving AWAY from the enemy (who's at y=2). This forces them to stay in their corner while I feast. I grow stronger, they stay stagnant.\n5. **SCORE CLOSURE**: I need to eat fast. (5,9) is the closest apple. Every apple I eat closes the 6-point gap. When I hit 13 apples, I can consider a showdown.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (5,9) now. Then move RIGHT to (6,9), (7,9), (8,9) to eat that apple. From (8,9), DOWN to (8,8) for the next apple. Build a horizontal barrier at y=9 from x=5 to x=9. Control the entire top row. Force Snake #1 to stay trapped below. When I have 13+ apples, start moving DOWN the right side to box them in completely. If they ever try to climb up, they crash into themselves. I win by default.\n\n**DECISION: RIGHT!** Let's eat that apple and claim the top-right! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25",

Let's analyze the board from our new head position (5,9).\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (5,9):**\n- **UP to (5,10)**: OFF THE BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (4,9)**: Empty now (we just came from there). SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (5,8)**: Board shows \".\" (empty). SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (6,9)**: Board shows \"A\" (apple!). SAFE! \u2705\n\n**ALL THREE MOVES (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT) ARE SAFE!** This is perfect\u2014we have maximum flexibility.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe're at (5,9) with three safe options. Let's evaluate each:\n- **LEFT to (4,9)**: Retreats toward the left side. From (4,9), we can go DOWN to (4,8) (which was an apple last turn, but we already ate it\u2014now empty), or RIGHT back to (5,9). Limited options.\n- **DOWN to (5,8)**: Takes us into the middle of the board. From (5,8), we have: UP (5,9), LEFT (4,8), RIGHT (6,8), DOWN (5,7). That's FOUR safe moves! But (5,7) is our own body (part of our horizontal wall). Actually, checking our body: [(5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]. So DOWN to (5,7) would be hitting our own body. That's a crash! \u274c So from (5,8), DOWN is actually unsafe. That leaves UP, LEFT, RIGHT as safe moves from (5,8). Still three options.\n- **RIGHT to (6,9)**: Hits an apple! From (6,9), we can go LEFT (5,9), DOWN (6,8), or RIGHT (7,9). All three are empty. This gives us three safe follow-up moves plus an apple. AND it extends our control of the top row.\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY: RIGHT!**\nHere's why this is the WINNING MOVE:\n1. **APPLE FARM**: (6,9) has an apple! We need to eat fast to close the 5-point gap. Every apple counts.\n2. **BOARD CONTROL**: (6,9) is further right, claiming more of the top row. We're building a horizontal barrier at y=9 that Snake #1 (stuck at y=2) cannot challenge.\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS**: From (6,9), we have three safe moves. We can continue right to (7,9) (which has an apple at (7,9) per the apple list!), then to (8,9) (another apple!). We're setting up a chain of apple consumption.\n4. **HERDING STRATEGY**: By staying at the top, we force Snake #1 to stay in the bottom-left corner. Their body is stretched across y=1 and y=2\u2014they have no path upward without crashing into themselves. We dominate the board.\n5. **SCORE CLOSURE**: We need to reach 13-14 apples to force a showdown. RIGHT gets us there faster.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (6,9) now. Next turn, move RIGHT to (7,9) (apple there!), then to (8,9) (apple there!), then DOWN to (8,8) (apple there!). Build a fortress at the top-right. Once we have 13+ apples, we can consider moving DOWN the right side to cut off the enemy's escape. If they ever try to climb up, they'll crash into their own body. We win by dominating the space.\n\n**DECISION: RIGHT!** Let's eat that apple and keep the pressure on! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25",

SAFE! \u2705\n\n**ALL THREE MOVES (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT) ARE SAFE!** Perfect flexibility again.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n- **LEFT to (5,9)**: Retreats left. Not ideal\u2014we're giving up board control. Limited options.\n- **DOWN to (6,8)**: Moves into the middle. From (6,8): UP (6,9), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8), DOWN (6,7). But (6,7) is our own body (wall at y=7)! So DOWN is unsafe from (6,8). That leaves 3 options.\n- **RIGHT to (7,9)**: APPLE! This is a HUGE move. From (7,9): LEFT (6,9), DOWN (7,8), RIGHT (8,9). That's 3 safe moves AND we get an apple! Also, (7,9) is an apple, and (8,9) is also an apple per the list! We're setting up a double apple grab.\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY: RIGHT!**\n1. **DOUBLE APPLE FARM**: (7,9) has an apple! Then next turn we can go RIGHT to (8,9) for ANOTHER apple! That's 2 points in 2 turns.\n2. **BOARD DOMINATION**: We're claiming the entire top-right quadrant. Snake #1 is stuck in the bottom-left with their long body\u2014they cannot reach us without crashing into themselves.\n3. **HERDING**: By staying top, we force the enemy to stay bottom. Their head at (0,3) is surrounded by their own body at y=1-2. They have no upward path.\n4. **SCORE CATCHUP**: We need +6 apples to tie. Eating these top-row apples gets us there fast.\n5. **LONG-TERM**: Once we have the apples, we can move DOWN the right side (to (9,8), (9,7), etc.) to cut off any escape. If they try to climb up, they'll crash into themselves.\n\n**DECISION: RIGHT!** Let's eat that apple and set up the double apple grab! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (7,9), next turn we'll have a choice: LEFT (back), DOWN (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (8,9) - ANOTHER APPLE!). We should go RIGHT again to grab that second apple, then consider moving DOWN to continue the path along y=8. Build the fortress, then close in.\n\n**DECISION: RIGHT!**",

SAFE! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (7,9)**: Empty (we just came from there). SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (9,9)**: Empty. SAFE! \u2705\n\n**ALL THREE MOVES (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT) ARE SAFE!** Fire options!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT to (7,9)**: Retreats back. We'd be giving up the apple we just walked onto! That's 0 points this turn. Bad for catchup.\n- **DOWN to (8,8)**: Moves down to an apple. From (8,8): UP (8,9), LEFT (7,8), DOWN (8,7), RIGHT (9,8). (8,7) is empty, (9,8) is empty, (7,8) is empty. All 4 moves are safe! This gives us the apple point and sets us up for the next turn with 4 safe options.\n- **RIGHT to (9,9)**: Empty. From (9,9): LEFT (8,9), DOWN (9,8). (9,8) is empty. Only 2 safe options. We lose the apple at (8,8) and trap ourselves in the corner.\n\n**THE DECISION IS CLEAR: DOWN!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe're executing the plan! We grabbed the apple at (8,9) and now we're grabbing the next one at (8,8)! That's +1 apple, putting us at 13 points vs Snake #1's 16. We're closing the gap!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (8,8), next turn we'll have multiple safe options. We should consider moving LEFT to (7,8) or DOWN to (8,7) to continue exploring the right side of the board. We're building an apple fortress and controlling the right flank while Snake #1 is stuck on the left edge. Let's keep pushing!\n\n**DECISION: DOWN!**\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Let's break down the board state and plan our next move to dominate this snake! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**ANALYSIS FROM (8,8):**\nWe're currently at (8,8) after eating that apple. Let's check all four directions:\n- **UP to (8,9)**: That's our previous tail position (which just moved). From the board, (8,9) shows 'A' (apple) but it's actually now empty because we just moved from there! However, wait... our tail is at (8,9) at the start of this turn? Let me check the body: Our head is (8,8), body is [(8,9), (7,9)...]. So (8,9) is actually our neck! Moving UP would be directly backwards into our own neck! That's suicide! \u274c DEAD!\n- **DOWN to (8,7)**: Empty on board. SAFE! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (7,8)**: Empty on board. SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (9,8)**: Empty on board. SAFE! \u2705\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT: Enemy Snake #1**\nSnake #1 is at head (2,4) with a long body stretching left. They're far away but moving. Need to watch for them cutting us off!\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- **DOWN to (8,7)**: Moves us closer to bottom-right. From (8,7): DOWN (8,6) empty, LEFT (7,7) empty (but watch our body at (7,7) - actually that's part of our body! (7,7) is in our body list!), RIGHT (9,7) empty, UP (8,8) our current position. We need to check: (7,7) is indeed our body from the list! So LEFT is dangerous after moving down! But DOWN itself is safe for one turn.\n- **LEFT to (7,8)**: Moves toward center. From (7,8): LEFT (6,8) empty, DOWN (7,7) is our body! DANGER! RIGHT (8,8) current, UP (7,9) is our body! So LEFT move would trap us with only one safe exit (LEFT again to 6,8). Bad!\n- **RIGHT to (9,8)**: Moves to right edge. From (9,8): LEFT (8,8) current, DOWN (9,7) empty, UP (9,9) empty. That's 2 safe options. Better than LEFT!\n\n**DECISION: RIGHT to (9,8)**\nWhy? \n1. It's SAFE this turn (empty cell)\n2. It positions us on the right edge with more maneuvering space\n3. From (9,8), we have DOWN to (9,7) and UP to (9,9) as future options\n4. We avoid the trap of moving LEFT where we'd be surrounded by our own body\n5. We're playing the long game - controlling the right side while Snake #1 is stuck on the left\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (9,8), next turn we'll have DOWN (9,7) and UP (9,9) as safe moves. We should head DOWN toward the apple at (9,2) eventually. We're building a fortress on the right flank while Snake #1 is linear on the left.

We're at turn 37 and the heat is ON! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break down this board state and plot our next move to dominate Snake #1!\n\n**ANALYSIS FROM HEAD (9,8):**\nWe're on the right edge after our last move. Let's check all four directions from (9,8):\n- **UP to (9,9)**: Empty on board! SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (9,7)**: Empty on board! SAFE! \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (8,8)**: That's our previous position (now part of our body). SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (10,8)**: Off the board! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nEnemy Snake #1 at (3,4) is still far left. Their body stretches to (8,0) and wraps around. They're not an immediate threat to our position.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\nFrom (9,8) we have THREE safe moves! Let's evaluate:\n- **UP (9,9)**: Gets us to the top-right corner. From there: DOWN (9,8) current, LEFT (8,9) empty. Only 2 options (down/left). Could get cornered!\n- **DOWN (9,7)**: Moves toward the apples at (9,2) and (8,4). From (9,7): UP (9,8) current, LEFT (8,7) empty, DOWN (9,6) empty. That's 3 safe options! MORE MOBILITY!\n- **LEFT (8,8)**: Moves back to previous spot. From (8,8): RIGHT (9,8) current, DOWN (8,7) empty, LEFT (7,8) empty. Also 3 options. But... we just came from there! Might be heading back into our own path.\n\n**DECISION: DOWN to (9,7)**\nWhy?\n1. **MOBILITY**: From (9,7) we have 3 safe exits (UP, LEFT, DOWN)\n2. **PROGRESSION**: Moving DOWN gets us CLOSER to the apples at (9,2) and (8,4)\n3. **AVOIDING TRAPS**: We're not cornering ourselves like UP would\n4. **FUTURE PLANNING**: From (9,7) we can go DOWN to (9,6), then potentially LEFT toward (8,4) or DOWN toward (9,2)\n5. **ENEMY AVOIDANCE**: We're staying on the right flank while Snake #1 is stuck left. Let's keep that separation!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (9,7), next turn I'll head DOWN to (9,6) \u2192 (9,5) \u2192 (9,4) \u2192 (9,3) \u2192 (9,2) to grab that apple. Meanwhile, I'll watch Snake #1's movement. If they try to cut across the bottom, we might need to pivot. But for now, let's dominate the right side and keep the pressure on!\n\n**DECISION: DOWN!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Let's check our options:\n- **UP to (9,8)**: That's our previous position (now body). SAFE \u2705\n- **DOWN to (9,6)**: Empty on board! SAFE \u2705\n- **LEFT to (8,7)**: Empty on board! SAFE \u2705  \n- **RIGHT to (10,7)**: Off the board! DEAD \u274c\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nEnemy Snake #1 at (4,4) is still left-centered. Their body goes all the way to (8,0). They're not immediately threatening our position, but watch that bottom edge! They might move DOWN to (4,3) or RIGHT to (5,4)...\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\nFrom (9,7) we have THREE safe moves! Let's analyze:\n- **UP to (9,8)**: Moves back to where we just came from. From there we'd have: DOWN (9,7) current, LEFT (8,8) body, UP (9,9) empty. Only 2 options and we're backtracking. Not ideal for momentum!\n- **DOWN to (9,6)**: Opens up the bottom-right corner! From there: UP (9,7) current, LEFT (8,6) empty, DOWN (9,5) empty. That's 3 options! Plus it puts us CLOSER to that apple at (9,2)! We can chain DOWN moves: (9,6)\u2192(9,5)\u2192(9,4)\u2192(9,3)\u2192(9,2) for that sweet apple!\n- **LEFT to (8,7)**: Moves us inward. From there: RIGHT (9,7) current, UP (8,8) body, DOWN (8,6) empty, LEFT (7,7) empty. Also 3 options. But... this moves us TOWARD the enemy's general area! Risky!\n\n**THE DOMINATION PLAN:**\nWe have 12 apples, they have 18. We're behind but making moves! The apple at (9,2) is PERFECT for us - right on our planned path! Let's grab it and close the gap!\n\n**DECISION: DOWN to (9,6)** \nWhy?\n1. **PATH TO APPLES**: Direct route to (9,2) apple! Chain 4 more DOWN moves and it's ours!\n2. **MOBILITY**: From (9,6) we have 3 safe exits (UP, LEFT, DOWN)\n3. **BOARD CONTROL**: Dominating the right flank while enemy stays left\n4. **AVOIDING CONFLICT**: Moving DOWN keeps us away from potential enemy movements at bottom-left\n5. **FUTURE PLANNING**: Next turn I'll head DOWN to (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2) for the apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nGrab that (9,2) apple, then assess enemy position. If they're still left, we continue RIGHT-SIDE DOMINATION! If they push right, we might need to pivot and cut them off. But for now, let's secure that apple and close the score gap!\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 DOWN move incoming!\n\nDOWN",

Our head\u2019s at **(4,4)**, enemy\u2019s prowling up at **(9,7)**, surrounded by his own wall of body on the top edge.  \n\n**What\u2019s around us?**  \n- **UP \u2192 (4,5)** \u2013 tasty apple, free space, and a clear runway toward the opponent\u2019s territory.  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,3)** \u2013 empty, but it drags us down toward the cramped bottom where our tail is already hanging.  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,4)** \u2013 open, but no immediate reward and it pushes us into a corridor that could funnel us later.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,4)** \u2013 straight into our own body \u2192 instant death. \u274c  \n\nThe opponent can only go **LEFT to (8,7)** or **DOWN to (9,6)** next turn, so a head\u2011on collision isn\u2019t on the table right now.  \n\n**Strategic call:**  \n- Grab the apple at (4,5) to extend our lead and keep our length growing where we need it.  \n- Moving upward opens up the central vertical lane, giving us future options to swing right and cut off the enemy\u2019s escape routes along the top.  \n- It also avoids the tight bottom\u2011right corner where our tail is stuck.  \n\nSo we stay aggressive, grab the fruit, and keep the pressure on! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**Next move:**  \n\nUP",

That was the right call - we kept our right flank secure and now we're perfectly positioned for the apple chain!\n\n**CURRENT HEAD POSITION:** (9,5)\n**BODY BEHIND US:** (9,6) - so moving UP into (9,6) is BACKWARDS into myself = instant death! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS - WHERE WE STAND:**\n- Enemy snake #1 head at (5,5) - they're RIGHT next to us horizontally! They're at x=5, we're at x=9.\n- Their body runs from (4,5) down to (8,0) - they control the bottom left quadrant.\n- They're 20 apples to our 12 - they're CRUSHING US. We NEED to close this gap aggressively!\n\n**MOVES FROM (9,5):**\n- **UP to (9,6)**: INTO MY OWN BODY! DEAD. \u274c  \n- **DOWN to (9,4)**: Let's check the board... from the visual: (9,4) shows 'T' - that's a tail! Wait no, looking closer at row 4: \"T T T T T . . A A .\" So (9,4) is empty? Let me trace the board...\nActually looking at the board representation: Row 5 (y=5) shows \" . . . . T 1 . . . 0 \" - that's our head at 9,5. Row 4 (y=4) shows \" T T T T T . . A A . \" - so (9,4) is the last position, which is empty (dot). So DOWN is safe!\n- **LEFT to (8,5)**: Board shows row 5 at x=8 is empty (dot). SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (10,5)**: Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**IMMEDIATE STRATEGY:**\nWe have TWO safe moves: DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5).\n\nLEFT to (8,5) moves us toward the enemy's position (5,5). They could move RIGHT to (6,5) or UP to (5,6). If we go LEFT, we're getting into potential head-on collision range. \n\nDOWN to (9,4) keeps us on our right flank domination path. From (9,4) we can then:\n- Move DOWN again to (9,3)\n- Then DOWN again to (9,2) - WHICH HAS AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We'll get the apple and close the score gap!\n\nPlus from (9,4), we have multiple exits: LEFT to (8,4), DOWN to (9,3), UP back to (9,5). \n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** The enemy is at (5,5) - if they move RIGHT to (6,5), they're still 3 cells away. No immediate head-on collision risk. We'll be at (9,4) - safe distance.\n\n**DECISION:** GO DOWN to (9,4)! This is our apple-grabbing path. Let's chain these DOWN moves and get that fruit at (9,2)!\n\nDOWN",

We just came from there. We can pivot back up.\n- **DOWN to (9,3)**: Empty cell, safe path down toward the apple at (9,2)!\n- **LEFT to (8,4)**: Empty! This moves us toward the center and potential apple at (8,4) which shows \"A\" in row 4!\n- **RIGHT to (10,4)**: Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nThe enemy is at (5,6) - if they move RIGHT to (6,6), they're still 3 cells away from us vertically. If they move UP to (5,7), they're going further away. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nWe have TWO strong options:\n1. **LEFT to (8,4)** - Gets us closer to the apple at (8,4) AND moves us toward the center for more control. From (8,4) we can then go DOWN to (8,3) or LEFT to (7,4) which also has an apple!\n2. **DOWN to (9,3)** - Follows our planned apple chain toward (9,2) but keeps us isolated on the edge.\n\n**AGGRESSION MODE ACTIVATED!** We need to close that 8-apple gap. Getting to the center gives us more apple options and board control. The apple at (8,4) is RIGHT THERE and we can reach it in one move!\n\n**FINAL CALL:** LEFT to (8,4)! We're grabbing that apple and expanding our territory. Let's show chat how we dominate the board center! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

But we have no apple there.\n- **LEFT to (7, 4)**: **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e This is our target! We get +1 apple and grow!\n- **RIGHT to (9, 4)**: This is our tail cell!

DEAD! \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nThe enemy is at (4, 6) - they're not in immediate collision range. If they move RIGHT to (5, 6), they're still far away. If they move UP to (4, 7) or DOWN to (4, 5), they're moving away from us. No immediate head-on collision risk!\n\nWe have a PERFECT opportunity right here:\n**LEFT to (7, 4)** - This cell has an apple! We'll collect it, grow our score to 14, and get closer to that 21-apple lead. From (7, 4) we'll have multiple follow-up options - we can go LEFT to (6, 4) (which has an apple!), DOWN to (7, 3), or UP to (7, 5).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to systematically sweep the left side of the board. After grabbing (7, 4), we should target (6, 4) and then (5, 4) to cut through the board center. We're building a wall from the right side moving left. This will box the enemy in the bottom-left corner!\n\n**AGGRESSION MODE ENGAGED!** That apple is MINE! Let's go!\n\nLEFT",

It also preserves a wide lane for future boxing maneuvers while the rival is still jammed on the right side.\n\n**\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Short\u2011term plan**  \n1. Move **LEFT** to (2,6).  \n2. Next turn we\u2019ll have three safe choices again, letting us either swing up toward the apple at (2,8) or snake down\u2011left to snag the bottom\u2011row apples and force the opponent into a tighter corridor.  \n3.

We need to start closing this FAST!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- We just moved LEFT to (7, 4) \u2705 - collected apple! Score is now 14!\n- Our new head: (7, 4)\n- Enemy head: (3, 6) - still in bottom-left\n- Board is getting crowded...\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - MOVES FROM (7, 4):**\n\n1. **UP to (7, 5)** - Check the map! (7, 5) shows \"T\" (enemy tail). SAFE? Actually let's verify - enemy body goes (3,6)\u2192(4,6)\u2192(5,6)\u2192(5,5)\u2192(4,5)\u2192(4,4)\u2192(3,4)... Wait, (7,5) is NOT in enemy body! The enemy is on the left side. (7,5) appears empty. Let me check board again... Row 5 shows: `. . . . T T A . . T` - columns 0-9. Column 7 (x=7) is `.` - empty! So UP is SAFE.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 3)** - Check row 3: `T . A . A . . . . .` - Column 7 is `.` - empty. SAFE!\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 4)** - Row 4: `T T T T T . . 0 T T` - Wait, we're at (7,4) and just moved there. Our body now is: (7,4) head, (8,4), (9,4), (9,5)... So (6,4) is NOT in our body. Check board row 4: positions 0-3 are `T` (enemy tail), position 4 is `T` (enemy), position 5 is `.`, position 6 is `.`, position 7 is `0` (us), position 8 is `T` (enemy), position 9 is `T` (enemy). Actually (6,4) shows as `.` - empty! SAFE!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 4)** - This is our OWN second segment! We just came from here. Moving back into our body = DEAD! \u274c\n\n**ELIMINATED:** RIGHT is instant death.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nWe need apples AND space to maneuver. The enemy is on the left, we're on the right. If we go LEFT, we're moving TOWARD the enemy but also toward more apples (there's an apple at (6,4) I think? Wait, checking apple list... Actually (6,4) isn't listed as an apple drop. Let me check the apples again...)\n\nApple drops: (3,0), (2,8), (6,0), (7,2), (9,2), (6,6), (5,2), (7,8), (0,0), (2,3), (0,9), (1,8), (6,5), (2,0), (4,3)\n\nFrom our position at (7,4):\n- (6,5) is an apple - that's UP and LEFT\n- (6,6) is an apple - that's UP and LEFT more\n- (7,8) is an apple - that's UP and RIGHT\n- (5,2) is an apple - that's DOWN and LEFT\n- (6,0) is an apple - that's DOWN and LEFT\n\n**AGGRESSION STRATEGY:** The enemy is at (3,6). They're growing fast (21 apples!). We need to be aggressive. Going LEFT (toward center) gives us more options to cut across and eventually box them in. Going UP keeps us on the right side but gets us closer to (7,8) apple. Going DOWN stays low but might trap us against bottom wall.\n\n**BEST MOVE: UP to (7, 5)**\n\nWhy?\n1. SAFE - empty cell\n2. Moves us toward (7,8) apple (3 spaces away)\n3. Keeps us in the central column (7) giving us flexibility to go LEFT or RIGHT later\n4. Stays away from immediate enemy collision zone\n5. Maintains escape routes - from (7,5) we can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or even back to (7,4) if needed\n6. Puts us at Y=5, which is above most of the enemy's current body (enemy body ranges Y=1 to Y=6)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):** From (7,5), we should continue UP toward (7,8) apple while watching enemy moves. If enemy moves toward us aggressively, we might need to cut LEFT to block their path. We need to start forming a barrier between our side and theirs.\n\nCHAT! We're making moves! UP we go! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25",

Actually, looking at the board: row 5 shows `. . . . T T A 0 . T` - position 7 is \"0\" (us) and position 6 is \"A\" (apple). So we're NOT on an apple.

We just moved here last turn. Moving back = death. \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to (6,5)** - There's an APPLE at (6,5)! And row 5: `. . . . T T A 0 . T` - Column 6 is \"A\" (apple). This is SAFE and gives us a point! But is it smart? Let's think...\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8,5)** - Row 5: Column 8 is \"T\" (enemy tail). That's occupied by enemy body! Moving there = death. \u274c\n\n**ELIMINATED:** DOWN (self-collision), RIGHT (enemy body).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nThe board is forming a natural divide. Our bodies are creating a barrier on the right side. The enemy's body is on the left. There's a narrow gap around columns 4-5.\n\n**If we go LEFT to (6,5) and EAT THE APPLE:**\n- We grow! Score becomes 15! \n- We move into the central corridor\n- We get closer to the enemy's territory\n- From (6,5) we can potentially cut off their escape routes\n- We create pressure - we're moving into their space\n\n**If we go UP to (7,6):**\n- We stay in our \"safe zone\"\n- We avoid immediate confrontation\n- But we miss an apple opportunity\n- We give the enemy more room to maneuver\n\n**AGGRESSION ANALYSIS:** We need to close the score gap! Eating an apple gives us +1 and puts us at 15. The enemy is at 21. We need to start dominating the board space, not just playing safe. Going LEFT takes the apple and positions us to potentially box them in from the right.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** Enemy at (2,6). If they move RIGHT, they go to (3,6). If we go LEFT to (6,5), we're now at (6,5). Even if they kept moving right for 3 turns, we'd have time to react. The apple at (6,5) is RIGHT THERE. We can't pass up scoring opportunities when we're behind!\n\n**DECISION:** GO LEFT! Take the apple at (6,5). Score 15. Move into the center. Show aggression. Force the enemy to react to us, not the other way around.\n\nChat, we're making a power play! LEFT for the apple! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**TURN 45 ANALYSIS - TIME TO LOCK DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE!**\n\nChat, we took the apple last turn and moved to (6,5). Score is 15-21. We're still down, but we're closing in. The enemy is at (2,7) now - they moved DOWN from (2,6). They're probably chasing that apple at (3,0) or something on the bottom left. We're on the right side, and our body is basically a wall from (7,5) all the way to (3,9). The enemy's body is on the left side, from (0,1) to (2,6). The board is getting divided, which is PERFECT for us.\n\nWe're at (6,5). Let's check our options:\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (6,5):**\n1. **UP to (6,6)** - Row 6 shows: `. . 1 T T T A . . T` - Column 6 is `A` (apple)! SAFE and gets us a point! But wait, the enemy head is at (2,7). If they move RIGHT and DOWN, they could threaten us? No, they're too far. This is safe.\n2. **DOWN to (6,4)** - Row 4 shows: `T T T T T . . T T T` - Column 6 is `.` (empty). SAFE. This would move us down into the central corridor.\n3. **LEFT to (5,5)** - Row 5 shows: `. . . . T T A 0 . T` - Column 5 is `T` (enemy tail). That's occupied by enemy body! Moving there = death. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (7,5)** - Row 5: Column 7 is `T` (our own body). We just came from there! Moving back = death. \u274c\n\n**ELIMINATED:** LEFT (enemy body), RIGHT (self-collision).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nWe have two SAFE moves: UP to (6,6) or DOWN to (6,4).\n\n**UP to (6,6):** \n- There's an APPLE right there! (6,6) shows \"A\" on the board. Eating it puts us at 16 points.\n- This moves us into the upper central area.\n- From (6,6), we can potentially move RIGHT toward (7,6) or UP toward (6,7).\n- But... our body is blocking a lot of the right side. Moving UP puts us in a slightly tighter spot.\n\n**DOWN to (6,4):**\n- Moves us into row 4, column 6, which is empty.\n- This is closer to the center and keeps us in the open corridor.\n- From (6,4), we have more maneuvering room: we can go DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,4), RIGHT to (7,4), or UP back to (6,5).\n- This keeps our options open for future plays.\n\n**AGGRESSION & LONG-TERM THINKING:**\nWe're down by 6 apples. We NEED to eat apples to catch up. The apple at (6,6) is RIGHT THERE. But is it worth the tighter positioning? \n\nActually, looking at the board, row 6 column 6 is an apple, but if we take it, we'll be surrounded by our own body more. The enemy is on the left side, and we want to control the right side and center. Moving DOWN to (6,4) keeps us in the central corridor and gives us more flexibility to chase other apples like (5,2), (4,3), (7,2) - these are all within reach from the center.\n\nBut wait, we NEED points. The apple at (6,6) is guaranteed right now. If we go DOWN, we might miss it. However, the enemy might eventually come into the center if they want apples there, and we want to be in a strong position to either cut them off or force a head-on collision.\n\nLet's think about the apple list: (3,0), (2,8), (6,0), (7,2), (9,2), (6,6), (5,2), (7,8), (0,0), (2,3), (0,9), (1,8), (2,0), (4,3), (0,7). There are apples all over. (6,6) is one of many. We should prioritize positioning over a single apple sometimes.\n\nFrom (6,4), we can go for (5,2) or (4,3) next turn. From (6,6), our options are more limited.\n\n**DECISION:** Go DOWN to (6,4). Keep the board open, maintain flexibility, and set up for a run of apple collection from the center. We're playing the long game to close the 6-apple gap.\n\nChat, we're not just eating apples - we're setting traps! DOWN we go! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**TURN 46 ANALYSIS - TIME TO BOX HIM IN!**\n\nChat, we're at (6,4) and the enemy is at (2,8). He's way up top left, we're central-right. We're down 15-22, but we've got the board position. Look at the layout: our body is a wall on the right side (columns 6-9 from y=4 to y=9), and his body is mostly on the left side (columns 0-5 from y=1 to y=8). The center is open, and we can use our body to cut him off from apples on the right and center.\n\nLet's check our options from (6,4):\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (6,4):**\n1. **UP to (6,5)** - Row 5 shows: `. . . . T T A 0 . T` - Column 5 is `T` (our own body)! We came from there. Moving back = death. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (6,3)** - Row 3 shows: `T . A . A . . . . .` - Column 6 is `.` (empty). SAFE.\n3. **LEFT to (5,4)** - Row 4 shows: `T T T T T . . T T T` - Column 5 is `T` (enemy body)! Moving there = death. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (7,4)** - Row 4: Column 7 is `T` (our own body)! We came from there. Moving back = death. \u274c\n\n**ELIMINATED:** UP (self-collision), LEFT (enemy body), RIGHT (self-collision).\n\n**ONLY SAFE MOVE: DOWN to (6,3)!**\n\nWait, hold up. That's literally our only move? Let's double-check. From (6,4):\n- UP: (6,5) is in our body list: yes, (6,5) is the second element. So self-collision.\n- LEFT: (5,4) is in enemy body? Enemy body: [(2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]. (5,4) is NOT in that list. My bad! (5,4) is actually empty! Let's re-check row 4: `T T T T T . . T T T` - The first T's are columns 0-4? Wait, need to parse the board correctly.\n\nBoard row 4: `T T T T T . . T T T`\nColumns: 0: T, 1: T, 2: T, 3: T, 4: T, 5: ., 6: ., 7: T, 8: T, 9: T\nSo (5,4) is `.` - empty! (6,4) is our head position (not shown on board). (7,4) is `T` (our body).\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4). Also possibly RIGHT? (7,4) is our own body, so no. UP is our own body.\n\nSo we have two safe moves: DOWN to (6,3) or LEFT to (5,4).\n\n**DOWN to (6,3):**\n- Row 3: `T . A . A . . . . .` - Column 6 is `.` empty.\n- This moves us down into row 3, which has apples at (2,3) and (4,3). We're at (6,3), so we're close to those apples.\n- From (6,3), we can go LEFT to (5,3) which is `.` empty, or DOWN to (6,2) which is `T` (enemy body? Let's check row 2: `T T T T . A . A . A` - Column 6 is `.` empty! Actually row 2 column 6 is `.` based on the pattern. But need to verify. Wait, row 2 is `T T T T . A . A . A`. Columns 0-9: 0:T,1:T,2:T,3:T,4:.,5:A,6:.,7:A,8:.,9:A. So (6,2) is `.` empty.\n- From (6,3), options: LEFT (5,3) empty, DOWN (6,2) empty, RIGHT (7,3) empty? (7,3) is `.` in row 3. UP (6,4) is where we came from (but we can't go back into our own body? Actually (6,4) will be our tail after we move, so it becomes empty. But careful: when we move, our tail moves forward. So (6,4) becomes part of our new body? Actually our new body will be: head at (6,3), then old head (6,4) becomes first body, etc. So (6,4) is occupied by our body after move. So we can't go back there immediately.\n\n**LEFT to (5,4):**\n- Row 4: column 5 is `.` empty.\n- From (5,4), we can go UP to (5,5) which is `T` (enemy body? Check enemy body: (5,5) is in enemy body list! Yes, (5,5) is there. So can't go UP.\n- LEFT to (4,4) which is `T` (enemy body? Check: (4,4) is in enemy body list? Yes, (4,4) is there.\n- DOWN to (5,3) which is `.` empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,4) which will be our body after move.\n\nSo from (5,4), the only safe move might be DOWN to (5,3). That's a tight spot.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe need to avoid getting trapped. Moving LEFT to (5,4) seems like it could lead to a dead end because UP and LEFT are enemy body, RIGHT is our body, only DOWN is open. That's only one option next turn, which is risky.\n\nMoving DOWN to (6,3) gives us more options: LEFT to (5,3) or DOWN to (6,2) or RIGHT to (7,3). That's three safe directions to consider next turn.\n\nAlso, we need to think about apples. At (6,3), we're closer to apples at (5,2), (4,3), (7,2). Actually (5,2) is an apple, (4,3) is an apple, (7,2) is an apple. From (6,3), we can chase these.\n\nBut more importantly, we want to box in the enemy. The enemy is at (2,8) heading somewhere. If we go DOWN, we're moving toward the bottom center, which is open. We can potentially cut off the apples on the right side (like (9,2)) or center apples.\n\nWait, but the enemy is on the left side. Our body is on the right side. By going DOWN, we're moving toward the bottom, which might allow us to eventually loop around and trap him on the left side? Actually, we want to force a head-on collision if we have higher score, but we're lower. So we need to eat apples.\n\nLet's think about the immediate apple: There's an apple at (6,6) but we're not going there. There's an apple at (5,2) which is reachable. From (6,3), we can go DOWN to (6,2) which is empty, then LEFT to (5,2) to eat the apple. That's a two-turn plan.\n\nFrom (5,4), we can go DOWN to (5,3), then DOWN to (5,2) to eat the apple. Also two turns.\n\nBut from (5,4), we have only one safe next move (DOWN to (5,3)), which is risky. From (6,3), we have multiple safe next moves, giving us flexibility.\n\n**AGGRESSION & POSITIONING:**\nWe need to be aggressive and control the board. The enemy is at (2,8). If we go DOWN, we're moving away from him, which might be good because we want to avoid head-on collision until we're ready. But we also want to cut off his access to apples on the right side. Our body already blocks the right side. By going DOWN, we might be able to eventually cut off the bottom right.\n\nActually, looking at the board, the enemy's body stretches from (2,8) down to (5,1). He's in a vertical line on the left. Our body is a horizontal line on the right from (3,9) to (9,4). The center is open. If we go DOWN, we're moving into the center-bottom, which is open. We could potentially loop around and come up from the bottom to trap him between our body and his own body? That's a long-term plan.\n\nBut we need to survive now. DOWN to (6,3) is the only move that gives us multiple options next turn.\n\n**DECISION:** GO DOWN to (6,3). This keeps our options open, moves us toward reachable apples, and maintains flexibility to either chase apples or cut off the enemy's access to the center. We'll eat that apple at (5,2) in a couple turns!\n\nChat, we're not just moving, we're setting up a trap! DOWN we go! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

We NEED to close that gap and survive. Let's check our options from (6,3).\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (6,3):**\n1. **UP to (6,4)** - Our old head position, now occupied by our growing body. Moving back = self-collision. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (6,2)** - Row 2: `T T T T . A . A . A` - Column 6 is `.` empty. SAFE. \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (5,3)** - Row 3: `T . A . A . . . . .` - Column 5 is `.` empty. SAFE. \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (7,3)** - Row 3: Column 7 is `.` empty. SAFE. \u2705\n\nWe have THREE safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is death.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n\n- **DOWN to (6,2):** Moves us toward the bottom right. From there we could go LEFT to (5,2) to eat the apple at (5,2). But the enemy is way up top left. Going DOWN moves us AWAY from him, which might be safe but not aggressive. We need to close the apple gap! The apple at (5,2) is the closest one to us right now.\n\n- **LEFT to (5,3):** Brings us closer to the apple at (5,2) in one move! From (5,3), we can go DOWN to (5,2) and eat that apple next turn. This is efficient apple-chasing. Also, we're moving toward the center-left, which might help us eventually cut off the enemy's escape routes on the left side.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,3):** Moves us right, away from both the enemy and the closest apples. Not great for apple collection. Our body already blocks the right side, so moving right might trap us in the corner eventually.\n\n**AGGRESSION & WIN CONDITION:**\nWe're 8 apples behind. We MUST eat. The closest apple is at (5,2). Going LEFT to (5,3) gets us one step closer. From (5,3), we can eat the apple next turn by going DOWN.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT puts us more centrally, which could help us eventually box in the enemy if we survive long enough to grow. But right now, apples are priority.\n\n**DECISION: GO LEFT to (5,3).** This positions us to eat the apple at (5,2) next turn, closing the score gap. We're not running from the fight\u2014we're fueling up for it! Once we eat, we'll be more competitive and can then plan to trap him.\n\nChat, LEFT is the move! Let's get that apple! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

SAFE. \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (6,3)** - Row 3: Column 6 is `T` (our own body from previous turns). Moving back into our own body = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n\n**MOVES ELIMINATED:** RIGHT is suicide (we'd hit ourselves). That's 3 safe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n\n- **DOWN to (5,2):** This is the MONEY MOVE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e We eat the apple at (5,2) and gain +1 point, closing the gap to 7 apples behind. From there, our next options are wide open: we could go LEFT to (4,2) or DOWN to (5,1) or RIGHT to (6,2). We're not trapped. We're fueling up for the win!\n\n- **LEFT to (4,3):** There's also an apple at (4,3)! But wait... is it safe? Row 3 at column 4 is `A` in the board state. However, we need to check if any enemy snake occupies (4,3). Our opponent Snake #1 is at (1,7) with a long body stretching around the left side, but (4,3) is clear. Moving LEFT gets us that apple too! But... let's check the board more carefully. The apple at (4,3) is listed in the apple drops, but we need to verify it's still there. Since no snake has eaten it yet (we haven't been there, enemy is far away), it's likely still there. So LEFT is also an apple-gaining move!\n\n- **UP to (5,4):** No apple here. Moves us upward, away from the bottom-left apples. Might be useful for positioning later, but doesn't help us score now.\n\n**DECISION TIME:** We have TWO apple moves! DOWN to (5,2) or LEFT to (4,3). Both get us +1 point. Which is better?\n\nLet's think long-term:\n- Eating at (5,2) puts us at (5,2) with the bottom-right area open. We could then go LEFT to (4,2) (maybe another apple?), DOWN to (5,1), etc.\n- Eating at (4,3) puts us at (4,3) with the left-center area open. From there, we might snake toward the enemy's territory on the left side to cut him off.\n\nBut wait! Let's check the enemy's position and likely moves. Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body trailing down to (5,1). If we go to (5,2), we're RIGHT next to his body at (5,1) and (5,5), etc. That could be dangerous if he moves into us. But if we go to (4,3), we're also near his body. Hmm.\n\nActually, looking at his body: he has segments at (5,1), (5,5), (5,6). (5,2) is adjacent to (5,1). So if we go DOWN to (5,2), and the enemy's head at (1,7) moves somewhere... his body might not move into us immediately since his body moves after his head. But we need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, LEFT to (4,3) is away from his immediate body but still in the general area.\n\n**AGGRESSION & WIN CONDITION:** We NEED points. Both DOWN and LEFT give us points. I'm leaning toward DOWN because (5,2) is a cleaner move\u2014we're not moving directly toward the enemy's body, and we maintain more options for the next turn. Also, the board shows (5,2) as `.` empty, meaning it's safe to move into (since apples don't block).\n\nLet's double-check: the apple at (5,2) is listed in apple drops, and no snake is on it. So moving there will eat it and grow.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat the apple at (5,2) to gain +1. Then, from (5,2), assess the board for the next apple while keeping an eye on Snake #1's movements. We need to force a confrontation once we've closed the score gap\u2014maybe 2-3 more apples and we go hunting.\n\n**DECISION:** Go DOWN to (5,2), eat the apple, and grow! This is the safest scoring move with the most future options.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

We're at turn 50 and it's time to make a move! \n\nLet's break down the board from our current position (6,2):\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (6,2):**\n- **UP to (6,3)**: Looking at row 3 - (6,3) is an 'A' (apple)! But wait, there's our own body segment there? Actually no, checking the snake body: we have (5,2), (5,3), (6,3)... wait, (6,3) IS in our body! That's the third segment in our body list. Moving UP into our own body = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n- **DOWN to (6,1)**: Row 1, column 6 - looking at the board: `T T . T T . . . A .` - Column 6 is '.' empty! But I need to check if any snake body is there. Our body? No, our body goes down to (9,8) etc. Enemy body? Enemy snake #1 has segments at (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) - none at (6,1). So this looks SAFE! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (5,2)**: This is where we just came from (our previous position). Moving directly backwards into our own body? Actually (5,2) was our head position BEFORE moving right to (6,2). So (5,2) is now our first body segment. Moving LEFT back into our own body = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (7,2)**: Row 2, column 7 - looking at the board: `. A A A . . A . A` - Column 7 is 'A' (apple)! And checking snake bodies: our body has (7,5), (7,4) but not (7,2). Enemy body? None at (7,2). This looks SAFE! \u2705\n\n**MOVES ELIMINATED:** UP (into own body), LEFT (backwards into own body) = DEATH TRAPS!\n\n**DECISION TIME:** DOWN to (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,2)?\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,2)** gives us an apple! That's +1 point, closing the gap to 17 vs 25 (8 apples behind). Plus, it puts us at the start of that top-right apple cluster.\n- **DOWN to (6,1)** is safe but doesn't get us an apple right away. However, it might give us more maneuvering room.\n\nBut wait - I need to think about what the opponent might do. The enemy head is at (0,8) and they're on the left side. They're moving toward us? Probably not immediately, but they're expanding their territory.\n\n**GO FOR THE APPLE!** We need to close that 9-apple gap ASAP. RIGHT to (7,2) gets us an apple AND positions us well for the next turn. From (7,2), we could potentially go to (8,2) or (7,1) or (7,3) depending on what's safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat our way through the top-right apple cluster: (7,2) \u2192 (9,2) \u2192 (9,3) \u2192 maybe (8,1) \u2192 (7,8) etc. We need aggressive point scoring. While we're doing this, watch the enemy's position and prepare to box them in or force a collision once we're close enough in score.\n\nLET'S GET THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

(Yes, we ate that apple on turn 50, bringing us to 17 apples)\n- Enemy head: (0,9) - top-left corner, but his body is snaking down and right from there\n- Score: 17 vs 26 - Gap is still 9 apples. We need to be AGGRESSIVE.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK (from current head position (7,2)):**\n- **UP to (7,3)**: Row 3 - board shows (7,3) = '.' (empty). Checking bodies: Our body? Yes! (7,4) and (7,5) are in our body, but (7,3) is clear. Enemy? Enemy has (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) but not (7,3). SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (7,1)**: Row 1 - board shows (7,1) = '.' (empty). Our body? No. Enemy? Enemy has (1,1), (2,1?), actually looking at board row 1: `T T . T T . . . A .` - column 7 is '.' empty. Enemy body doesn't reach that far. SAFE! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (6,2)**: This is our previous position! (6,2) was our head before moving RIGHT to (7,2). It's now our first body segment. Moving LEFT back into own body = DEATH. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (8,2)**: Row 2, column 8 - board shows (8,2) = 'A' (apple!) Looking at snake bodies: Our body? (8,4), (8,8), (8,9) but not (8,2). Enemy? Enemy has (8,?) Actually no, enemy is all on left side. SAFE! \u2705\n\n**MOVES ELIMINATED:** LEFT (backwards into own body) = INSTANT DEATH\n\n**DECISION TIME - UP vs DOWN vs RIGHT:**\n\n**OPTION 1: RIGHT to (8,2) - APPLE ALERT! \ud83c\udf4e**\n- Eats apple immediately +1 point = 18 apples (still 8 behind)\n- Positions us at the start of the top-right apple cluster: (8,2) \u2192 (9,2) (another apple!) \u2192 (9,3) (apple!) \u2192 etc.\n- This is the AGGRESSIVE path - eat our way through the right side\n- From (8,2), we have 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT back to 7,2 which is now body, but we won't go there)\n\n**OPTION 2: UP to (7,3)**\n- Safe but no apple immediately (7,3) is empty\n- Moves us toward (7,8) which is an apple but that's far\n- From (7,3), we can still go to (8,3) or (7,4) but (7,4) is our own body! (Wait no, (7,4) is in our body list, so that's a trap)\n- Actually looking at our body: (7,5), (7,4) are both in our body, so from (7,3) going UP would be into (7,4) - DEATH! So actually from (7,3) we could only go DOWN or LEFT or RIGHT. LEFT goes to (6,3) which is also our body! This is getting TRAPPED!\n\n**OPTION 3: DOWN to (7,1)**\n- Safe, no apple immediately (7,1) is empty\n- Moves toward (8,1) which is an apple! That's close.\n- From (7,1), we could go to (8,1) next turn for apple, or UP back to (7,2) (now empty after we leave), or LEFT to (6,1) safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nWe're behind 9 apples. We need to be AGGRESSIVE. The RIGHT move to (8,2) gives us an apple NOW and sets us up perfectly for the top-right apple cluster. \n\nFrom (8,2), next turn we can:\n- RIGHT to (9,2) = another apple! +1\n- Then from (9,2) \u2192 (9,3) = another apple! +1\n- We could clean up 3 apples in 3 turns!\n\nCompare that to:\n- DOWN to (7,1) \u2192 then RIGHT to (8,1) = 1 apple in 2 turns\n- UP to (7,3) \u2192 no apples nearby, might get trapped\n\n**THE MATH:** Right now we're 9 apples behind. Eating 3 apples in 3 turns while the enemy might only get 1-2 is our only path to victory. We need to close the gap FAST.\n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is on the left side. They have 26 apples already. They could win in 4 more apples. They're expanding, but they're far away. We have time to eat the right side cluster before they can reach us.\n\n**RISK:** From (8,2), could the enemy head move into us this turn? Enemy head at (0,9) would need to move 9 squares right and 7 squares down to reach (8,2) in one turn. Impossible. Zero risk of collision this turn.\n\n**VERDICT: GO FOR THE APPLE CLUSTER!**\nMove RIGHT to (8,2) to eat that apple and set up for a clean sweep of the top-right corner. This is the aggressive play we need to close the gap.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (for next turn):**\n1. Turn 51: Move RIGHT to (8,2), eat apple (18 total)\n2. Turn 52: Move RIGHT to (9,2), eat apple (19 total)  \n3. Turn 53: Move UP to (9,3), eat apple (20 total)\n4. While eating, watch enemy's position. If they get within 2-3 apples of us, start maneuvering for a head-on collision opportunity.\n\n**FINAL MOVE: RIGHT** - Let's get that apple and dominate the right side!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me check the actual board state provided: Row 3 is `T . A . A T T . . A` - so column 8 is '.' (empty). Our own body? We have (8,4), (8,8), (8,9) but not (8,3). So UP is SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (8,1):** Row 1, column 8. Board shows (8,1) = '.' (empty). Our body? No. Enemy body? Enemy is on left side. SAFE! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (7,2):** This was our previous position! (7,2) was head before we moved RIGHT. Now it's first body segment. Moving LEFT into own body = DEATH! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (9,2):** Row 2, column 9. Board shows (9,2) = 'A' (APPLE!) Our body? We have (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8) but not (9,2). Enemy? Enemy is on left. SAFE! \u2705\n\n**MOVES ELIMINATED:** LEFT (backwards into body) = INSTANT DEATH\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe're at (8,2) with an apple just eaten. The top-right corner is CLEAR for us to dominate! We have:\n- (9,2) = Apple \ud83c\udf4e\n- (9,3) = Apple \ud83c\udf4e  \n- (7,8) = Apple \ud83c\udf4e (we can reach this later)\n- (8,1) = Apple \ud83c\udf4e (one down)\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** We need to eat FAST! The enemy has 26, we have 18. We're 8 behind. Every apple counts!\n\nFrom (8,2), we can:\n- RIGHT to (9,2) = eat apple +1 = 19 total\n- Then UP to (9,3) = eat apple +1 = 20 total  \n- Then LEFT to (8,3) or DOWN to (9,2) but wait (9,2) will be empty after we leave\n- Then maybe head toward (7,8) or (8,1)\n\n**ENEMY THREAT:** They're at (1,9) with a long body down the left side. They can't reach us in time. We have the right side to ourselves!\n\n**VERDICT:** RIGHT to (9,2) is the move! We eat another apple, keep the momentum, and set up for (9,3) next turn. We need to stack apples quick!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. Turn 52: RIGHT to (9,2) \u2192 eat apple (19)\n2. Turn 53: UP to (9,3) \u2192 eat apple (20)\n3. Turn 54: LEFT to (8,3) \u2192 no apple, but positioning\n4. Turn 55: DOWN to (8,2) (now empty) or LEFT to (7,3) to head toward (7,8) apple\n5. Keep an eye on enemy - if they start heading right, be ready to cut them off!\n\nWe're the underdog, but we eat FAST! Let's go!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's analyze this turn like a hawk! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**TURN 53 ANALYSIS - THE GRIND IS REAL!**\n\n**IMMEDIATE SITUATION:**\n- **My head:** (9, 2) - just moved RIGHT from (8,2) last turn! \u2728\n- **Enemy head:** (2, 9) - they moved UP from (1,9) last turn\n- **Score:** 18 vs 26 - Still 8 behind, but we're hunting!\n- **Apple Status:** We're sitting on (9,2) which is EMPTY now (we ate it last turn, right? Let me check...)\n\n**WAIT, CRITICAL CHECK:** Looking at the board state provided:\n- Row 2: `T T T T . T T T T 0` - Column 9 shows '0' (that's us!)\n- The apple list shows (8,1), (9,3), etc. but (9,2) is NOT listed as an apple anymore\n\n**SAFETY CHECK from (9,2):**\n- **UP to (9,3):** Row 3, column 9. Board shows row 3 is `T . A . A T T . . A` - column 9 is 'A' (APPLE!) \u2705 Safe and profitable!\n- **DOWN to (9,1):** Row 1, column 9. Board shows row 1 is `T T . . . . . A A .` - column 9 is '.' (empty). Safe! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (8,2):** This was our previous position! Now it's body. Moving LEFT into own body = DEATH! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (10,2):** Off the board! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**MOVES ELIMINATED:** LEFT (into body), RIGHT (off board)\n\n**TWO OPTIONS REMAIN:**\n1. **UP to (9,3):** Gets us an apple! +1 score = 19. This continues our upward march. But then what?\n2. **DOWN to (9,1):** No apple there. Safe, but not growing.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nEnemy is at (2,9) with a massive body down left side. They're far from us. We have the entire right side! \n\nFrom (9,3) after going UP:\n- Next turn we could go LEFT to (8,3), or DOWN back to (9,2), or RIGHT off board (no), or UP to (9,4) but (9,4) is our body!\n- (9,4) is in our body list! So from (9,3), UP would be into our own body! That's death next turn!\n- So from (9,3) we'd have to go LEFT to (8,3) or DOWN to (9,2).\n\nFrom (9,1) after going DOWN:\n- Next turn we could go UP (back to 9,2), LEFT to (8,1), RIGHT off board, or DOWN to (9,0).\n- (9,0) is off board actually! Row 0 only goes to x=9? Wait, row 0 is `A . A A . A A . . .` - that's columns 0-9. So (9,0) exists and is '.' (empty).\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (2,9). Where will they go? Looking at their body, they can't go DOWN into (2,8) which is their body. They could go UP (off board), LEFT to (1,9) (their body), or RIGHT to (3,9). (3,9) is empty on board (row 9 shows `T T T 1 . . . . . T .` - wait that's confusing).\n\nLooking at the provided board:\n```\n9 T T T 1 . . . . . T .\n```\nWait, that's row 9? Actually no, looking at the coordinates: `9` is the y-value, then the row. Row 9 shows: `T T T 1 . . . . . T .`\nColumn 9 on row 9 is `T` (enemy body actually, because enemy body is at (0,9), (1,9), etc. No wait, (9,9) would be column 9 row 9, but enemy is at (2,9) and their body extends to (0,9) but not (9,9). \n\nActually looking more carefully at the board state:\n```\n9 T T T 1 . . . . . T .\n```\nThis means:\n- Column 0: T\n- Column 1: T  \n- Column 2: T\n- Column 3: 1 (enemy head!)\n- Column 4: .\n- Column 5: .\n- Column 6: .\n- Column 7: .\n- Column 8: .\n- Column 9: T\n\nSo (3,9) is enemy head! (2,9) is body, (1,9) body, (0,9) body, (9,9) is T (some body? Wait no, that's our body! We have (9,8) and (9,7) etc. Yes (9,9) is NOT in our body list. Let me check our body... we have (9,2), (9,4) through (9,8), and (8,9). So (9,9) is empty? But board shows T...\n\nWait the board shows `(9,9)` as `T`? Let me re-examine. Row 9 is y=9. The string is `T T T 1 . . . . . T .` - that's 11 characters? No, it should be 10. Let me count: T(0) T(1) T(2) 1(3) .(4) .(5) .(6) .(7) .(8) T(9). That's 10 characters. So (9,9) is T (some snake body). But is it ours or enemy's?\n\nOur body: (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8) - so (9,9) is not ours. Enemy body: (2,9) head, (1,9), (0,9) - so (9,9) is not enemy. So (9,9) must be... empty? But it shows T. Maybe I'm misreading.\n\nActually wait! Looking at the apple list: there's (9,3) apple. The board shows `(9,3)` as what? Row 3 is `T . A . A T T . . A` - column 9 is 'A' (apple at (9,3)). Good.\n\nLet me focus on what matters: From (9,2), UP to (9,3) is an apple. That's growing. DOWN to (9,1) is empty.\n\n**AGGRESSION TIME:** We're 8 points behind! We NEED apples! UP gets us an apple NOW. From (9,3), we can then go LEFT to (8,3) next turn, which appears empty and safe. Then we can navigate toward other apples like (8,1) or (7,8).\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** \n- UP: Eat apple, grow to 19. From (9,3), we have 2 safe exits (LEFT, DOWN). \n- DOWN: No growth, from (9,1) we have 3 safe exits (UP, LEFT, DOWN).\n\nBut we need GROWTH to catch up! Every turn not eating is falling behind!\n\n**THE PLAY:** UP to (9,3)! Eat that apple, keep the momentum, set up to sweep left across row 3.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- Turn 53: UP to (9,3) \u2192 eat apple (19)\n- Turn 54: LEFT to (8,3) \u2192 position\n- Turn 55: LEFT to (7,3) or DOWN to (8,2) depending on apple locations\n- Hunt all apples on right side, force enemy to react!\n\nLET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Turn 54, let's GO! \ud83d\udd25 We're 19-26 against Snake #1, still chasing, but we're growing!\n\n**CRITICAL UPDATE FROM LAST TURN:**\nWe just moved UP to (9,3) and grabbed that apple! Our head is now at (9,3), score is 19. Enemy is still at (3,9) with 26 apples. We're in the fight!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SITUATION (HEAD AT (9,3)):**\n- **UP to (9,4):** That's our own body! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (9,2):** That's our body from last turn! DEAD! \u274c  \n- **LEFT to (8,3):** Checking board... row 3 is `T . A . A T T . . A` - column 8 is 'T'? Wait no, let me read carefully: Row 3 = `T(0) .(1) A(2) .(3) A(4) T(5) T(6) .(7) .(8) A(9)`. So (8,3) is '.' (empty)! SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (10,3):** Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**ONLY ONE SURVIVABLE MOVE!** LEFT to (8,3)! \n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\nWe're forced to go LEFT, but this is actually perfect! From (8,3) we can then go DOWN to (8,2) or LEFT to (7,3), giving us options. Enemy is stuck in the top-left corner with their massive body. They have limited moves. \n\nWe're sweeping across row 3, hunting apples! (8,3) is empty, (7,3) is empty (row 3 col 7 is '.'), (6,3) is 'T' (our body actually, from our tail section). Wait let me check... our body: (9,3) is head now, (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)... so (6,3) IS our body! So we can't go LEFT beyond (7,3).\n\nBut from (8,3) next turn, we can go DOWN to (8,2) which is empty (row 2 col 8 is 'T'? Wait row 2 is `T T T . . T T T T 0` - col 8 is 'T', but that's our body? Actually (8,2) is in our body list: `(8,2)` is second element! So (8,2) IS our body! \u274c\n\nWait I need to check again. Our body from head (9,3):\n- (9,2) - body\n- (8,2) - body  \n- (7,2) - body\n- (6,2) - body\n- (5,2) - body\n- (5,3) - body\n- (6,3) - body\n- etc.\n\nSo from (8,3) next turn:\n- DOWN to (8,2): body! DEAD!\n- LEFT to (7,3): empty! SAFE!\n- UP to (8,4): row 4 col 8 is 'T'? Row 4 is `T T T T T . T T T T` - col 8 is 'T', but is it ours? Our body has (9,4), (9,5)... but not (8,4). Actually wait, we have (8,4) in body? Let me check the list: `(8,4)` is in there! Yes, body includes (8,4). So UP is body! DEAD!\n- RIGHT to (9,3): head just moved from there, but it's empty now? Actually (9,3) will be empty after we leave, but moving back into where we just came from is allowed as long as it's not body. But (9,3) will be empty after we move. So RIGHT is safe from body perspective, but we're moving into a cell that was just our head. That's allowed.\n\nActually, moving BACKWARDS directly into the cell you just left is typically allowed in snake games as long as it's empty. But from (8,3), RIGHT goes to (9,3) which we just left. That's safe.\n\nSo from (8,3) we'll have: LEFT (7,3) and RIGHT (9,3) as safe moves. That's two options, which is good!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (3,9) with body below. They can't go DOWN (body at (3,8) is in their body? Let me check: enemy body includes (3,8)? Their body: (3,9) head, (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). So (3,8) is NOT in their body, it's empty! So they could go DOWN to (3,8). Or LEFT to (2,9) which is their body! Or UP off board! Or RIGHT to (4,9) which is empty (row 9 col 4 is '.'). \n\nMost likely they'll go DOWN or RIGHT to stay on board and maybe find apples.\n\n**OUR PLAN:**\nWe're forced LEFT to (8,3). Then next turn we'll likely go LEFT to (7,3) since that gives us more board space. We need to keep moving left to find apples and eventually force a confrontation.\n\n**THE PLAY:** LEFT to (8,3) - no choice, but it's actually a good position to continue our sweep!\n\nLEFT",

Row 4, col 8 = 'T' (from board: row 4 = `T T T T T . T T T T`), and checking MY BODY - yes, (8,4) is in my body list! **DEAD! \u274c**\n- **DOWN to (8,2):** Board shows 'T' at (8,2) from my body list. **DEAD! \u274c**\n- **RIGHT to (9,3):** Board shows 'T' at row 3 col 9? Wait row 3 is `T . A A A T T . . A` - col 9 is 'A' (apple), but more importantly, (9,3) was my previous head position. It's now EMPTY. **SAFE! \u2705** (Moving back into where I just came from is allowed)\n- **LEFT to (7,3):** Board shows '.' at row 3 col 7. **SAFE! \u2705**\n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICE:**\nI have TWO safe moves: RIGHT to (9,3) or LEFT to (7,3).\n\n**RIGHT to (9,3):**\n- Pros: There's an apple at (9,3)? Wait no, row 3 col 9 is 'A' in the board state, but (9,3) is the coordinate. Let me re-read the board...\nActually the board shows row 3: `T . A A A T T . . A` - that's columns 0-9. So col 9 is 'A'. That's (9,3)! So RIGHT takes me to an apple! +1 point! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Cons: I'm moving back to where I just was. It feels passive, but it's a guaranteed apple.\n\n**LEFT to (7,3):**\n- Pros: Moves me deeper into the board, toward row 7 where there might be more apples. More strategic positioning.\n- Cons: No immediate apple, and I might get trapped later.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need to CATCH UP to the enemy (27 apples)! Taking an apple NOW is CRITICAL. RIGHT to (9,3) gives me point #20, closing the gap to 20 vs 27. \n\nPlus, from (9,3) next turn:\n- I can go LEFT back to (8,3) (empty)\n- I can go UP to (9,4) (empty? Row 4 col 9 is 'T' but is it mine? My body has (9,4) - YES, so UP is dead)\n- DOWN to (9,2) is my body - DEAD\n- RIGHT off board - DEAD\n\nWait, from (9,3) I'd only have LEFT as safe move. That's a problem - I'd be trapped moving left and right between (9,3) and (8,3). \n\nLet me reconsider... The apple at (9,3) is tempting, but it might trap me. LEFT to (7,3) gives me more freedom to maneuver and potentially find more apples down the line. \n\nBut I NEED to catch up! The enemy has 27 apples, I have 19. I'm 8 apples behind. Every apple counts!\n\n**DECISION:** I'm taking the apple! RIGHT to (9,3) for point #20, then I'll figure out the next move. Sometimes you gotta take what's given!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab this apple at (9,3), then pivot left to (8,3) and continue sweeping left through row 3 to find more apples. The enemy is stuck in the top-left corner - we have more board to work with. We need to be aggressive and force a confrontation when we have the apple advantage.\n\nRIGHT",
