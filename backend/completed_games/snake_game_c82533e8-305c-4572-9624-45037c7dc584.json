The enemy snake (#2) is located at (9, 3).\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that the closest apple is at (7, 5), which is just one square away from my current position. However, going directly for that apple would put me in danger of running into the enemy snake.\n\nA safer move would be to go LEFT, which would move me to (6, 4). This would give me some space between myself and the enemy snake, while also keeping me close to the apples on the left side of the board.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn would be to continue moving LEFT, trying to get closer to the apples on the left side of the board without getting too close to the enemy snake. Once I'm in a good position, I can start moving up towards the apples.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: LEFT."
