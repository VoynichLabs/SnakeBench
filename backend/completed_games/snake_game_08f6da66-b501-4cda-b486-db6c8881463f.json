Here a few scenarios:\n\n- Moving up will position the snake closer to Apple (4,7). However, this could result in getting trapped by snake #2 from behind if it decides to move down.\n\n- Moving right presents a clear path to the apple at (4,0), but it would result in moving away from the other apples.\n\n- Moving downward will also provide a clear path to the apple at (4,0). However, a leftward movement thereafter has to be timed correctly as moving left immediately would result in death as the snake's head would collide with the body.\n\nGiven these scenarios, the move providing the maximum chance of gaining a point safely seems to be to move upward to get closer to the apple at (4,7) while staying away from snake #2.\n\nAs for strategy for next turn, depending on the move of snake #2, if it moves down, move right and then up to eventually reach the apple at (4,7). \n\nDecided next move: UP."

The closest apple is at (4, 7), which is 2 steps up and 1 step to the right.\n3. The enemy snake is currently below me at (3, 4), so moving down is not an option.\n4. Moving left or right doesn't immediately lead to an apple, but it's safer than going up as it keeps some distance from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy:\n- Focus on collecting the nearest apples while avoiding the enemy snake.\n- Try to trap the enemy snake or block its path to the apples if possible.\n- Keep an escape route in mind to avoid getting trapped.\n\nFor now, I think the best move is to go RIGHT. This allows me to move towards the apple at (4, 7) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. I'll reassess the situation after the enemy snake makes its move.\n\nRIGHT"
