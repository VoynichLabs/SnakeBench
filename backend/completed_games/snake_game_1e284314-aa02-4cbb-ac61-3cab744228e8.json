Let's analyze this board and figure out how to box in our archrival!\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n- My head: (5, 6)\n- Enemy head: (5, 1)\n- Apples scattered around, many closer to enemy\n- 10x10 board, plenty of space to maneuver\n\n**Immediate Safety Check:**\n- UP to (5, 7): Clear, no body collision\n- DOWN to (5, 5): Clear, no body collision  \n- LEFT to (4, 6): Clear, no body collision\n- RIGHT to (6, 6): Clear, no body collision\n\nAll moves are immediately safe! Now let's think strategy...\n\n**The Big Picture:**\nEnemy is at (5, 1) - bottom middle-ish, while I'm at (5, 6) - middle. The board has apples at:\n- (7, 5), (4, 4), (1, 6), (7, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (1, 9), (3, 3), (9, 8), (5, 2), (3, 9), (9, 6), (8, 7), (3, 4), (5, 9)\n\nI'm closer to apples at (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 7), (8, 7), (9, 6) if I move RIGHT.\nI'm closer to (4, 4) and (3, 4) if I move LEFT or DOWN.\nI'm closer to (5, 9) if I move UP.\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\nThe enemy is lower down at y=1. If I want to dominate and box them in, I should consider:\n- Moving RIGHT puts me toward the right edge and apples like (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 7)\n- Moving LEFT puts me toward the left side with apples at (4, 4), (3, 4)\n- Moving UP puts me toward the top (y=9) where there's (5, 9), (1, 9), (3, 9)\n- Moving DOWN toward the enemy is dangerous but could set up future aggression\n\nSince the enemy is at (5, 1), they can't immediately reach the top-right apples. I should claim territory on the right/top side first to cut off their expansion options.\n\n**My Plan:** Move RIGHT toward the cluster of apples on the right side - (6, 5), (7, 5), (6, 7), (8, 7), (9, 6). This positions me to dominate the right side of the board and makes it harder for the enemy to reach those apples later. Plus, it keeps me away from direct collision risk while giving me room to maneuver.\n\n**Future Self Plan:** Claim the right side apples first, then potentially swing down or left to cut off enemy expansion paths. Watch enemy's movement patterns.\n\nRIGHT",

No body collision, and I see (6, 7) is actually an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN to (6, 5): Clear! Also an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- LEFT to (5, 6): Clear! That's where I just was\n- RIGHT to (7, 6): Need to check... (7, 6) isn't occupied\n\nAll four directions are immediately safe! But wait...\n\n**STRATEGIC MINDSET:**\nThe enemy is at (5, 2) - way down low. They're 5 cells below me. I'm currently at (6, 6) in the middle-right area.\n\nLooking at the apple distribution:\n- Bottom-left area: (1, 6), (1, 9), (3, 9), (3, 4), (4, 4), (3, 3), (0, 2)\n- Right side: (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 3), (8, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8)\n- Top area: (5, 9)\n\n**THE TACTICAL CHOICE:**\nI see TWO apples right next to me - (6, 5) DOWN and (6, 7) UP! I can't grab both this turn, but I can pick one direction and start establishing dominance.\n\nBut here's the question: Do I want to be aggressive RIGHT NOW or play it safe? The enemy has 1 apple on me, so I'm behind in the score race. I NEED to start eating!\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY:**\nI'm choosing UP to (6, 7)! Here's why:\n1. **CONTENT ALERT!** \ud83c\udf4e (6, 7) is an apple! I get my first point and GROW to 2 segments!\n2. **TERRITORY CONTROL:** Moving UP positions me toward the top-right corner where there are multiple apples (9, 8), (8, 7), (9, 6), (5, 9), (3, 9), (1, 9)\n3. **DISTANCE FROM ENEMY:** The enemy is 5+ cells away at (5, 2). They can't reach me for several turns. By the time they climb up, I'll have claimed more territory and grown bigger.\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** After eating at (6, 7), I'll have MORE space to maneuver and can go for (8, 7) or (9, 6) or swing left to (5, 9). The options are OPEN!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat upward toward (6, 7) \u2192 Then grab (8, 7) or (9, 6) \u2192 Build my body to control the right side \u2192 Force the enemy into the bottom-left corner where space is tighter \u2192 Eventually cut them off and dominate!\n\nLet's get this first apple and start the comeback! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

With my higher score, a head\u2011on will drop him.  \n- Always keep at least two escape routes open to avoid being boxed into a corner.\n\n**Decision:** go straight toward the middle, stay aggressive, and keep the board open.\n\nUP",

I'm now 2 segments long: Head (6, 7) \u2192 Body [(6, 6)]\n- Enemy head: (5, 3) - they're still chilling at (5, 3), now with body [(5, 2)]\n- Score: We're TIED 1-1! Time to push ahead!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- **UP to (6, 8):** Clear! No bodies, no walls\n- **DOWN to (6, 6):** That's my own body segment! \u274c DEAD if I go there\n- **LEFT to (5, 7):** Clear! No obstacles\n- **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Clear! No obstacles\n\nSo I have 3 safe options: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nThe enemy is way down south at (5, 3). They're 4 cells away vertically from me. They're heading upward slowly. I need to think about territory control.\n\nLooking at the apple map again:\n- My zone: Right side has (8, 7), (9, 6), (9, 8) - all clustered near me\n- Enemy zone: Bottom-left has (1, 6), (1, 9), (3, 9), (3, 4), etc.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 7), I'm pushing toward (8, 7) and (9, 6) - clustering apples! If I go UP to (6, 8), I'm chasing (9, 8) and (5, 9). If I go LEFT to (5, 7), I'm cutting across to the top-left where there are also apples (3, 9), (1, 9).\n\n**THE CALL:**\nI'm going **RIGHT** to (7, 7)! Why?\n1. **AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING:** I'm claiming the right side of the board for myself\n2. **APPLE CONCENTRATION:** (8, 7) and (9, 6) are RIGHT there - I can grab them in 1-2 turns\n3. **TERRITORY DENIAL:** By controlling the right, I force the enemy to the tighter left/bottom areas where they're more likely to trap themselves\n4. **FUTURE MOBILITY:** (7, 7) gives me options to go UP to (7, 8) or stay right to (8, 7) or even swing back left if needed\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (8, 7) next turn \u2192 Then (9, 6) or (9, 8) \u2192 Build my body up to 4-5 segments \u2192 Dominate the right side \u2192 Force the enemy into the bottom-left corner where space is cramped \u2192 Cut them off and watch them crash!\n\nLet's goooo! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN secures an apple while staying on the edge!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Secure the apple at (9, 6) to tie the score 4-4, then continue controlling the right edge. Once I'm size 5+, I'll push DOWN toward (9, 5) and (9, 4) to cut off any enemy expansion to the right. Then I'll start boxing them in from the west while they're stuck in the bottom-left!

That's my own body! Let me check again. Actually position 6 is \"1\" but that's the enemy! So LEFT is into enemy body! \u274c DEAD if I go there!\n- **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Within board! Row 5: \". . . T T . 1 0 T .\" - position 8 is \"0\" (MY OWN BODY)! \u274c DEAD if I go there!\n\n**WAIT... ALL MOVES ARE DEADLY?** Let me re-read the board state more carefully...\n\nLooking at the board:\n```\n5 . . . T T . 1 0 T .\n```\nPosition 5 is \"T\" (my tail at (5,5)?), position 6 is \"1\" (enemy body?), position 7 is \"0\" (my head at (7,5)?), position 8 is \"T\" (my body), position 9 is \".\"\n\nWait, my head is at (7,5), so position 7 should be \"0\". The board shows position 7 as \"0\" which is correct for MY head. Position 8 is \"T\" which is my body (8,5). Position 9 is \".\" which is empty.\n\nSo from (7,5):\n- UP (7,6): Row 6 shows position 7 is \"T\" (my tail at (9,8)? Wait that doesn't match...)\n- Actually let me map this properly:\n  - My body: [(8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (7,5)] - last one is head\n  - So (8,5) is body, (8,6) is body, (9,6) is body, (9,7) is body, (9,8) is tail\n\nLooking at row 6: \". A . . . . . T T T\"\n- Position 7 is \"T\" - that's (7,6)? But my body doesn't have (7,6). Let me check my body again...\n- My body: (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (7,5)\n- So (7,6) is NOT in my body. Why is there a \"T\" at position 7 in row 6?\n- Row 6 is y=6. Position 7 is (7,6). The \"T\" at position 7 in row 6 must be the enemy tail!\n- Let me check enemy body: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n- Enemy head is (6,5). Their body includes (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4).\n- So (6,5) is enemy head, (6,4) is enemy body.\n- Row 6 shows \". A . . . . . T T T\" - positions 7,8,9 are T's. But my body has (9,6), (9,7), (9,8).\n- Position 9 in row 6 is (9,6) - that's my body. Position 8 is (8,6) - that's my body. Position 7 is (7,6) - that's... not my body, but could be enemy tail or empty.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful. Let me re-read the enemy body list: \"Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)]\"\nWait, the first element in the body list is usually the neck (second segment after head). But the prompt says \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\"\n\nSo for enemy: Head is (6,5), then body is [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\nSo enemy occupies: (6,5) head, (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) tail.\n\nFor me: Head is (7,5), body is [(8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8)]\nSo I occupy: (7,5) head, (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8) tail.\n\nNow checking moves from (7,5):\n- UP to (7,6): Row 6, position 7. Row 6 is y=6. \". A . . . . . T T T\"\n  - Position 7 is (7,6). The \"T\" here... is it my body? My body has (8,6) at position 8, (9,6) at position 9.\n  - Position 7 is (7,6). Is (7,6) in my body? NO. Is it in enemy body? Enemy has (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). No (7,6).\n  - So (7,6) appears to be EMPTY on the board! But the board shows \"T\" at position 7... wait, the board shows \"T\" for position 7 in row 6.\n  - Let me re-examine the board string: \". A . . . . . T T T\"\n  - Spaces: position 0: \".\", position 1: \"A\", position 2: \".\", position 3: \".\", position 4: \".\", position 5: \".\", position 6: \".\", position 7: \"T\", position 8: \"T\", position 9: \"T\"\n  - So (7,6) is \"T\". Who owns that \"T\"? Looking at my body: I have (9,6), (9,7), (9,8) as tail. (8,6) is in my body too. But (7,6) is not listed in my body.\n  - Could (7,6) be enemy tail? Enemy body ends at (3,4), so no.\n  - This is confusing. Let me assume the board is accurate and (7,6) contains a \"T\" that I cannot move into.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the board state, I think the \"T\" symbols on the board might represent the tails of both snakes. Let me check:\n- My tail is at (9,8)\n- Enemy tail is at (3,4)\n\nBut the board shows T's at various positions. The board might be showing where tails WERE or something. This is ambiguous.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The prompt says \"BODY STATE\" shows my actual body coordinates. I should trust that over parsing the ASCII board which seems to have discrepancies.\n\nMy body: (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8)\nEnemy body: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\nFrom (7,5):\n- UP (7,6): Check if (7,6) is in MY body: NO. Is it in ENEMY body: NO (enemy has (6,4), (5,4), etc., but not (7,6)). So this should be SAFE.\n- DOWN (7,4): Check if (7,4) is in MY body: NO. Is it in ENEMY body: NO (enemy has (6,4), but not (7,4)). So this should be SAFE.\n- LEFT (6,5): Check if (6,5) is in MY body: NO. Is it in ENEMY body: NO (enemy HEAD is at (6,5), but that's the head, not body. The body is (6,4) and below). Wait, if I move to (6,5), and enemy head is also moving to (6,5) this turn (they're moving RIGHT from (6,4)), then we have a head-on collision at (6,5). Both die. Since I have more apples (6 vs 5), if we both die, I WIN!\n- RIGHT (8,5): Check if (8,5) is in MY body: YES! (8,5) is the first element in my body list. So moving RIGHT into (8,5) would be hitting my own body. \u274c DEAD!\n\nSo:\n- UP (7,6): Safe (not in my body, not in enemy body)\n- DOWN (7,4): Safe (not in my body, not in enemy body)  \n- LEFT (6,5): Safe but risky - potential head-on collision if enemy moves RIGHT into (6,5)\n- RIGHT (8,5): DEAD (into my own body)\n\nNow, the enemy is at (6,4) and likely to move. They have apples at (5,8), (6,2), (1,1), etc. They might move UP to (6,5) to try to get apples or block me.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,5), and enemy moves RIGHT to (6,5), we collide and both die. Since I have 6 apples and they have 5, I WIN the tiebreaker! This is actually a GOOD strategy when ahead.\n\nBut let me check if there's a safer option. UP to (7,6) is safe. DOWN to (7,4) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board for apples: (5,8) is an apple. From (7,5), I could move DOWN then LEFT to try to get there, but that's two turns away.\n\nThe enemy is at (6,4). If I move UP to (7,6), I'm moving away from them. If I move DOWN to (7,4), I'm getting closer to them but not directly.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the head-on collision. The prompt says: \"If we're tied 5-5 and we end up in a head-on collision, I WIN!\" That's true. But we're NOT tied anymore - I'm ahead 6-5. If we both die in a head-on collision, the one with MORE apples wins, which is ME! So forcing a head-on collision is actually a WINNING move for me.\n\nBut is the enemy likely to move into (6,5)? They're at (6,4). If they move UP, they go to (6,5). If I move LEFT to (6,5), we collide. This seems like a good trap!\n\nHowever, the enemy might anticipate this and move elsewhere. Let me think about what's optimal.\n\nAlternative: Move UP to (7,6). This is safe, opens up more space, and I can still threaten the enemy. From (7,6), I can go LEFT to (6,6) or DOWN to (7,5) next turn.\n\nBut wait - if I move UP to (7,6), the enemy at (6,4) might move UP to (6,5). Then next turn, I'm at (7,6), they're at (6,5). That's not a collision, but I could potentially move LEFT to (6,6) to cut them off.\n\nActually, I think the BEST move is to move LEFT to (6,5) and force the collision. Here's why:\n1. I have more apples (6 vs 5), so if we both die, I WIN\n2. The enemy is predictable - they might move UP to (6,5) to explore or get closer to apples\n3. If they DON'T move into (6,5), then I've successfully moved to their previous position (6,5) and I'm safe\n4. Either way, I'm not worse off\n\nActually, wait. If I move LEFT to (6,5) and the enemy moves somewhere else (not into (6,5)), then I'm at (6,5) which is safe. Then next turn, I can continue pressuring them.\n\nBut there's a risk: if the enemy moves RIGHT into (6,5) and I move LEFT into (6,5), we collide and both die. Since I have more apples, I win. This is actually a GOOD outcome!\n\nLet me also check if moving to (6,5) is immediately safe - is (6,5) occupied right NOW by any body?\n- My body: (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8) - NO (6,5)\n- Enemy body: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) - NO (6,5)\n- Enemy head: currently at (6,5) WAIT! The enemy head is CURRENTLY at (6,5)? No, wait. The scoreboard says: \"Snake #1 - Head: (6, 5)\" - that's their head position AT THE START OF THIS TURN.\n\nSo at the START of turn 11:\n- My head: (7,5)\n- Enemy head: (6,5)\n\nWe're ADJACENT! And if I move LEFT to (6,5), and they move RIGHT to (7,5), we swap positions. But if they move UP, DOWN, or LEFT, we don't collide.\n\nBut wait - the rules say \"Another snake's head moves into YOUR body? THEY die.\" If I move to (6,5) and they move to (7,5), they're moving into my body? No, I'm leaving (7,5), so (7,5) would be empty when they arrive.\n\nActually, let me re-read: \"If two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" So if I move LEFT to (6,5) and they move RIGHT to (6,5), we both die. If I move LEFT to (6,5) and they move elsewhere, only I move to (6,5).\n\nGiven that I'm ahead 6-5, forcing a head-on collision where both die results in my win. So moving LEFT to (6,5) is actually a WINNING STRATEGY if the enemy cooperates by moving into the same cell.\n\nBut the enemy might not move into (6,5). They might move UP to (6,6) or DOWN to (6,4) (but (6,4) is their own body, so they can't go DOWN). Or LEFT to (5,5).\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think about what's safest and most strategic.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (6,5)\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (7,5): We swap positions, no collision\n- If enemy moves UP to (6,6): I move to (6,5), they move to (6,6), no collision\n- If enemy moves LEFT to (5,5): I move to (6,5), they move to (5,5), no collision\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (6,4): They can't, that's their own body\n\nWait, if enemy moves RIGHT to (7,5), and I move LEFT to (6,5), we're not in the same cell. We're swapping positions. No collision.\n\nThe ONLY way we collide is if we both try to move into the SAME cell. Since we're adjacent (me at 7,5, them at 6,5), we can't both move into the same cell unless one of us moves diagonally, which isn't allowed.\n\nActually, I was wrong. If I'm at (7,5) and they're at (6,5), we can't both move into the same cell this turn because we're already in adjacent cells. The only way for a head-on collision is if we were in the same cell, or if we move in a way that puts us in the same cell.\n\nFor example, if I move LEFT to (6,5) and they move RIGHT to (7,5), we swap. No collision.\n\nSo moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe from immediate collision. It's just moving into their current head position, but they're leaving it.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. At the start of the turn, I'm at (7,5) and enemy is at (6,5). We're adjacent. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,5) and they move RIGHT to (7,5):\n- I arrive at (6,5)\n- They arrive at (7,5)\n- We just swapped positions. No collision.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,5) and they move UP to (6,6):\n- I arrive at (6,5)\n- They arrive at (6,6)\n- No collision.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,5) and they move LEFT to (5,5):\n- I arrive at (6,5)\n- They arrive at (5,5)\n- No collision.\n\nSo moving LEFT to (6,5) is safe! And it puts pressure on the enemy.\n\nBut wait, is (6,5) actually safe? Is there anything there?\n- My body: (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8) - (6,5) is clear\n- Enemy body: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) - (6,5) is clear\n- The enemy head is currently at (6,5) but they're moving away\n\nSo (6,5) is safe for me to move into.\n\nNow, what about the other options?\n\nUP to (7,6): \n- Is (7,6) safe? My body doesn't include it. Enemy body doesn't include it. So yes, safe.\n- From (7,6), I have options: LEFT to (6,6), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,6) but (8,6) is my body, so that's risky.\n\nDOWN to (7,4):\n- Is (7,4) safe? My body doesn't include it. Enemy body doesn't include it. So yes, safe.\n- From (7,4), I have options: LEFT to (6,4) but (6,4) is enemy body, so DEAD. UP to (7,5) but I just left there. DOWN to (7,3) which might be safe. RIGHT to (8,4) which might be safe.\n\nRIGHT to (8,5):\n- (8,5) is my body, so DEAD. Cannot go there.\n\nSo the viable moves are LEFT, UP, and DOWN.\n\nWhich is best?\n\nLEFT to (6,5):\n- Moves me into enemy territory\n- Cuts off enemy from right side\n- Puts me adjacent to enemy head (who will be somewhere else after moving)\n- Good aggressive positioning\n\nUP to (7,6):\n- Moves me away from enemy\n- Opens up top area\n- Less aggressive, more defensive\n\nDOWN to (7,4):\n- Moves me toward enemy but not directly\n- Gets me closer to bottom-left apples\n- But (6,4) is enemy body, so I can't go LEFT from there\n\nI think LEFT to (6,5) is the most aggressive and best for pressuring the enemy. It puts me right in their face and limits their movement.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the board state. Looking at row 5: \". . . T T . 1 0 T .\"\nThis means:\n- (0,5): \".\"\n- (1,5): \".\"\n- (2,5): \".\"\n- (3,5): \"T\" (tail)\n- (4,5): \"T\" (tail)\n- (5,5): \".\"\n- (6,5): \"1\" (enemy head)\n- (7,5): \"0\" (my head)\n- (8,5): \"T\" (my body)\n- (9,5): \".\"\n\nSo at the start of turn 11:\n- (6,5) is enemy head\n- (7,5) is my head\n- (8,5) is my body\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,5), I'm moving to where the enemy head currently is. But the enemy will move simultaneously, so they'll leave (6,5) and I'll arrive there. This is fine.\n\nIf I move UP to (7,6), I need to check what's at (7,6). Row 6: \". A . . . . . T T T\"\n- (7,6) is position 7, which is \"T\". But whose \"T\" is it? My tail is at (9,8). Enemy tail is at (3,4). So (7,6) shouldn't be a tail.\n- Unless... the board is showing something else. Maybe the \"T\" represents obstacles or something else?\n\nActually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me trust the body lists given in the prompt, not the ASCII board which seems to have discrepancies.\n\nMy body: (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8)\nEnemy body: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\nFrom (7,5):\n- UP to (7,6): Not in my body, not in enemy body \u2192 SAFE\n- DOWN to (7,4): Not in my body, not in enemy body \u2192 SAFE\n- LEFT to (6,5): Not in my body, not in enemy body \u2192 SAFE\n- RIGHT to (8,5): In my body \u2192 DEAD\n\nSo LEFT, UP, and DOWN are all safe moves.\n\nNow, which gives me the best strategic advantage?\n\nLEFT to (6,5):\n- Puts me on the enemy's current position (they'll be gone)\n- Cuts off the enemy's access to the right side of the board\n- Good for containment\n\nUP to (7,6):\n- Moves me upward, away from the enemy\n- Gives me access to top-right area\n- Less aggressive\n\nDOWN to (7,4):\n- Moves me downward, toward enemy's body\n- Gets me closer to bottom-left apples\n- But from (7,4), I can't go LEFT (enemy body at (6,4))\n\nI think the best move is LEFT to (6,5) because it's the most aggressive and positions me to box the enemy in. The enemy is currently at (6,5), but they'll move somewhere else. By moving to their current position, I'm claiming that territory and pressuring them.\n\nLet me make the call: LEFT to (6,5) is the move!\n\nLEFT",
