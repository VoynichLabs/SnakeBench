But based on the previous info, our snake's position is at (2,2) with body at [(2,1)]. It appears there's a discrepancy: earlier it said at (2,2), but the last move was UP from (2,1) to (2,2). Since the last move was UP, the head has moved to (2,2), and the body is at [(2,1)]. So current head position: (2,2).\n\n- The cell below (2,1) has an apple at (2,1). Moving down would land us on the apple at (2,1). \n\n- But wait, the last move was UP to (2,2), so previous position was (2,1). Therefore, still, the apple at (2,1) is accessible by moving DOWN, which would be a safe and direct way to eat it again.\n\n- Our snake currently has a length of 2 (head at (2,2) and body at (2,1)), so moving back onto its own body would be dangerous.\n\n- Moving DOWN from (2,2) to (2,1) would land on the tail's current position—since the tail just moved, it's vacated, so moving onto (2,1) is safe if the tail has moved away. But we have to consider whether moving back onto the tail's previous position is safe in this turn. If the snake's body is (2,2) and (2,1), then moving down onto (2,1) would collide with itself, which is dangerous.\n\n- Wait, the initial position was at (2,2) with body at [(2,1)]; so the snake's length is 2. Moving down to (2,1) would cause collision with its own body segment at (2,1), which is occupied.\n\n- Therefore, moving DOWN onto (2,1) is invalid as it results in self-collision.\n\n- Moving UP from (2,2) to (2,3): (2,3) is empty and is not occupied by any snake. Moving UP is safe and will increase the snake's position upward.\n\n- Moving LEFT from (2,2) to (1,2): it's free, but not closer to any apple, which at this point isn't optimal given our immediate goal.\n\n- Moving RIGHT from (2,2) to (3,2): also free, but again not as immediate an opportunity.\n\nOur goal: to eat the apple at (2,1). Since moving down causes self-collision, we cannot take that path.\n\nThe best move is to go UP to (2,3), which is safe and allows us to approach the next apples in the future.\n\nNext turn strategy: after reaching (2,3), plan to navigate toward apples at (3,9) and beyond, possibly moving eastward to connect to the horizontal path at y=7-9.\n\nSo, my decision: move UP.\n\n**Next move:** UP",

This gives me 1 point and my new head position is now at (2, 4), with the body segment at (3, 4) moving to (2, 4).\n\n**Current State:**\n- My position: (2, 4)\n- My body now occupies: [(3, 4), (2, 4)]\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\n- Apples are still located at (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8), (3, 9), and (2, 7). Among these:\n  - (2, 7) is directly above me.\n  - The others are further away.\n\n**Enemy Snake:**\n- Enemy Snake #0 is at (2, 3) with their body at [(2, 2)]. This suggests the area below me is hazardous since straying into (2, 3) would lead to collision.\n\n**Available Moves:**\n- UP to (2, 5) - Empty space.\n- DOWN to (2, 3) - Contains enemy snake (not a valid move).\n- LEFT to (1, 4) - Backtracking (not a valid move).\n- RIGHT to (3, 4) - Contains my body segment (not a valid move).\n\nGiven these movements:\n- The only valid move is UP to (2, 5), which will allow me to continue avoiding the enemy snake and looking for future apples.\n\n**Strategizing for Next Move:**\n- After moving UP to (2, 5), I will still need to assess my next options. The apple at (2, 7) becomes a reachable target after this move. I'll remain vigilant regarding enemy movements below me and calculate further based on my options.\n\nNext move: UP",
