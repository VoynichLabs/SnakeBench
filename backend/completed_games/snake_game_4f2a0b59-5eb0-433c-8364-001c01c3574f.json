Let's calculate distances to apples (Manhattan distance = |\u0394x| + |\u0394y|):\n1. (9,3): |9-7| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n2. (9,6): |9-7| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n3. (6,8): |6-7| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n4. (2,1): |2-7| + |1-5| = 5 + 4 = 9\n5. (3,0): |3-7| + |0-5| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\nClosest apples are at (9,6) (distance 3) and (6,8) (distance 4). (9,6) is the closest.\n\n### Path Planning to (9,6)\nTo reach (9,6) from (7,5):\n- (7,5) -> (7,6) -> (8,6) -> (9,6)\n  - (7,6): empty\n  - (8,6): empty\n  - (9,6): apple\n\nThis path is straightforward and doesn't require complex maneuvers. The first move is UP to (7,6).\n\n### Enemy Movement Considerations\nEnemy is at (2,9). Possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (3,9), it could threaten your path if you go UP to (7,6) and then RIGHT to (8,6), but (3,9) is far from your path.\n- If enemy moves LEFT to (1,9), it's also not blocking your path.\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (2,8), it's moving away from your path.\n\nNo immediate threat to your path from enemy movement.\n\n### Safe Follow-up Moves\nIf you move UP to (7,6):\n- Next possible moves: UP (7,6) -> (7,7), DOWN (7,6) -> (6,6), LEFT (7,6) -> (6,6), RIGHT (7,6) -> (8,6).\n  - (7,7): empty\n  - (6,6): empty\n  - (8,6): empty\nAll are safe.\n\n### Long-term Strategy Note (for future self):\n- Prioritize reaching the closest apple at (9,6) to gain length and points.\n- Avoid getting trapped in corners or tight spaces; keep body segments flexible.\n- Monitor enemy movements to avoid collisions; if enemy is moving towards your path, adjust accordingly.\n- If another apple becomes closer than (9,6), switch focus to that apple.\n\n### Final Decision:\nMove UP to (7,6) to start heading towards the closest apple at (9,6).\n\n**UP**",

Possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n     - If they move DOWN to (5,9), they could threaten (6,8) or (6,9).\n     - If they move LEFT to (3,8), they could block paths to (6,8).\n     - If they move RIGHT to (4,8), they might head toward (6,8) or (9,6).\n   - Monitor their movement to avoid collisions.\n\n3. **Snake Growth & Positioning:**\n   - After eating (9,6), my snake will grow to length 2.

Wait, no\u2014the apple at (9, 6) was not eaten yet because your head was at (8, 6) on Turn 10, and you moved DOWN to (9, 6) on Turn 10. So on Turn 11, your head is at (9, 6), and the apple at (9, 6) is now gone (you ate it on Turn 10? No, you didn\u2019t eat it on Turn 10 because you moved from (8, 6) to (9, 6), and there was no apple at (9, 6) on Turn 10. Wait, the apples at Turn 10 were (9, 3), (9, 6), etc. So on Turn 10, you moved from (8, 6) to (9, 6), and there was an apple at (9, 6). So you ate it on Turn 10, and your snake grew to length 1 with body [(9, 6)] on Turn 10. But the board state says your snake had no body on Turn 10. This is inconsistent.\n\n**Reconstructing the Timeline:**\nFrom the last move info:\n- Turn 10: Your snake head was at (8, 4), body was none (length 0), and you moved DOWN to (8, 5)? No, the last move was DOWN from (8, 6) to (9, 6). Wait, the board state shows your head at (8, 4) on Turn 10, but the last move was DOWN from (8, 6). This is conflicting. Let\u2019s assume:\n  - On Turn 10, your head was at (8, 6), body was none (length 0), and you moved DOWN to (9, 6). On Turn 11, your head is at (9, 6), body is [(9, 6)] (length 1, because you ate the apple at (9, 6) on Turn 10? No, you couldn\u2019t have eaten it on Turn 10 because you moved from (8, 6) to (9, 6), and there was no apple at (9, 6) on Turn 10. Wait, the apples at Turn 10 were (9, 3), (9, 6), etc. So on Turn 10, you moved from (8, 6) to (9, 6), and there was an apple at (9, 6), so you ate it, and your snake grew to length 1 with body [(9, 6)]. But the board state says your snake had no body on Turn 10. This suggests the apple at (9, 6) was not eaten on Turn 10, meaning you didn\u2019t move to (9, 6) on Turn 10. This is confusing.\n\n**Assuming Correct State for Turn 11:**\nFrom the last move info:\n- On Turn 10, your head was at (8, 6), body was none (length 0), and you moved DOWN to (9, 6). On Turn 11, your head is at (9, 6), body is none (length 0), and the apple at (9, 6) was not eaten yet. This implies you did not eat the apple at (9, 6) on Turn 10, meaning the apple was not at (9, 6) on Turn 10. This suggests the apple list is for Turn 11, not Turn 10. So on Turn 11, apples are at (9, 3), (9, 6), etc., and your head is at (9, 6), so you can eat it on Turn 11.\n\n**Current State (Turn 11):**\n- Your snake: Head at (9, 6), body none (length 0).\n- Apples: (9, 3), (9, 6), (2, 1), (3, 0), (7, 0).\n- Enemy (Snake #1): Head at (6, 8), body [(6, 4)].\n\n**Possible Moves for Your Snake (Turn 11):**\n1. UP: (9, 6) \u2192 (8, 6). Safe (no collision).\n2. DOWN: (9, 6) \u2192 (10, 6) \u2192 **OUT OF BOUNDS (invalid)**.\n3. LEFT: (9, 6) \u2192 (8, 6). Same as UP.\n4. RIGHT: (9, 6) \u2192 (9, 7). Safe (no collision).\n\n**Apple Prioritization:**\n- (9, 6): You are already at (9, 6), so you can eat it on Turn 11 by staying still? No, you must move. So you cannot eat (9, 6) on Turn 11 because you must move. Wait, the rules say you move your head, and if the new head position is an apple, you eat it. So if you move to (9, 6) from somewhere else, you eat it. But you are already at (9, 6), so you cannot eat it on Turn 11. The apple at (9, 6) is now gone (you must have eaten it on Turn 10). Wait, no\u2014the apple list is for Turn 11, so the apple at (9, 6) is still there on Turn 11, but you are already at (9, 6), so you cannot move there again. This suggests the apple at (9, 6) was eaten on Turn 10, meaning you moved to (9, 6) on Turn 10 and ate it, growing to length 1 with body [(9, 6)]. But the board state says your snake had no body on Turn 10. This is inconsistent.\n\n**Assuming:**\n- On Turn 10, your head was at (8, 6), body none (length 0), and you moved DOWN to (9, 6), eating the apple at (9, 6), so your snake grew to length 1 with body [(9, 6)].\n- On Turn 11, your head is at (9, 6), body [(9, 6)], and the apple at (9, 6) is gone (eaten on Turn 10). So the apple list for Turn 11 is incorrect or outdated. The correct apple list for Turn 11 should exclude (9, 6). Assuming the apple list is for Turn 11, and you are at (9, 6) with body [(9, 6)], you cannot move to (9, 6) again, so the apple at (9, 6) is irrelevant.\n\n**Correct Apples for Turn 11:**\nFrom the apple list: (9, 3), (9, 6), (2, 1), (3, 0), (7, 0). Since you are at (9, 6) with body [(9, 6)], the apple at (9, 6) is gone (eaten on Turn 10). So apples are: (9, 3), (2, 1), (3, 0), (7, 0).\n\n**Enemy (Snake #1) on Turn 11:**\n- Head at (6, 8), body [(6, 4)].\n- Possible moves: UP (to (6, 9)), DOWN (to (7, 8)), LEFT (to (5, 8)), RIGHT (to (6, 7)).\n\n**Your Options on Turn 11:**\n1. UP: (9, 6) \u2192 (8, 6). Safe (no collision with enemy or your body).\n   - Next turn, you can move to (8, 5) or (8, 7) or (7, 6) or (9, 6) (but (9, 6) is your body).\n   - Distance to (9, 3): 1 (DOWN from (8, 6)).\n   - Distance to (7, 0): 3 (DOWN-LEFT).\n   - Distance to (2, 1): 5 (UP-LEFT).\n   - Distance to (3, 0): 6 (DOWN-LEFT).\n2. LEFT: (9, 6) \u2192 (8, 6). Same as UP.\n3. RIGHT: (9, 6) \u2192 (9, 7). Safe.\n   - Next turn, you can move to (9, 8) or (8, 7) or (10, 7) (invalid).\n   - Distance to (9, 3): 3 (DOWN).\n   - Distance to (7, 0): 4 (DOWN-LEFT).\n   - Distance to (2, 1): 6 (UP-LEFT).\n   - Distance to (3, 0): 7 (DOWN-LEFT).\n\n**Best Move:**\n- Move **UP** to (8, 6). This positions you to eat (9, 3) next turn by moving DOWN to (9, 3).\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 7) is less efficient for reaching (9, 3).\n- Moving LEFT is the same as UP.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (7, 8), they could threaten (7, 0) or (6, 8).\n- If enemy moves LEFT to (5, 8), they might head toward (4, 8) or (5, 7).\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 7), they could block (6, 8) if you try to reach it.\n- If enemy moves UP to (6, 9), they might avoid immediate threats.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\n- Prioritize eating (9, 3) next turn by moving UP to (8, 6) on Turn 11.\n- Avoid getting cornered by enemy movements.\n- Keep options open for reaching (7, 0) or (2, 1) if (9, 3) is blocked.\n\n---\n**UP**",

The apple at **(9,3)** is now directly **DOWN** from my current position. This is the highest-value apple (central, high-contest) and should be prioritized.\n   - Snake #1\u2019s head is at **(9,2)** (after moving **RIGHT** from **(8,2)** on Turn 13). Its body is at **(7,2)**, so it cannot immediately block **(9,3)** unless it moves **UP** to **(9,3)** on Turn 14. However, this would be a collision risk for Snake #1 if I also move **DOWN** to **(9,3)**. Thus, I must assume Snake #1 will avoid this collision.\n   - **Move DOWN** to **(9,3)** to eat the apple. This grows my snake to length 1 and secures a high-value position.\n\n2. **Secondary Targets:**\n   - After eating **(9,3)**, I will pivot toward **(7,0)** (low-contest, safe) or **(2,1)** (less contested but farther). Snake #1\u2019s head is at **(9,2)**, so it could move **UP** to **(9,3)** (blocking my path) or **LEFT** to **(8,2)** (retreat). If Snake #1 moves **UP** to **(9,3)**, I must adjust to avoid collision (e.g., move **LEFT** to **(9,2)** and then pivot).\n   - Monitor Snake #1\u2019s body at **(7,2)**\u2014it could expand **UP** to **(8,2)** or **DOWN** to **(6,2)**. Avoid moving into **(7,2)** unless necessary.\n\n3. **Enemy Avoidance:**\n   - Snake #1\u2019s head is at **(9,2)**, so moving **LEFT** to **(9,2)** would collide. Moving **UP** to **(9,7)** is safe but unnecessary. Moving **DOWN** to **(9,3)** is optimal.\n   - If Snake #1 moves **UP** to **(9,3)**, I must move **LEFT** to **(9,2)** and then pivot to **(8,2)** or **(9,1)** to avoid collision.\n\n4. **Body Management:**\n   - My snake is length 1, so no immediate risk of self-collision. After eating **(9,3)**, I\u2019ll grow to length 2, so future moves must avoid moving into my own tail.\n\n5. **Long-term Control:**\n   - Dominate the **lower-right quadrant** (e.g., **(7,0)-(9,3)**) to block Snake #1\u2019s movements. Avoid getting boxed in by Snake #1\u2019s potential **UP** or **RIGHT** expansions.\n\n---\n**Analysis for Turn 14:**\n- **Current State:**\n  - My snake: Head at **(9,6)**, body none. Apples left: **(9,3)**, **(2,1)**, **(3,0)**, **(7,0)**.\n  - Enemy (Snake #1): Head at **(9,2)**, body at **(7,2)**. Likely to move **UP** (to **(9,3)**), **DOWN** (to **(9,1)**), **LEFT** (to **(8,2)**), or **RIGHT** (to **(10,2)**\u2014invalid, so likely **UP** or **LEFT**).\n- **Safe Moves for Me:** **DOWN** to **(9,3)**, **LEFT** to **(9,5)**, **RIGHT** to **(9,7)**.\n- **Best Move:** **DOWN** to **(9,3)**.\n  - This secures the apple at **(9,3)** and grows my snake to length 1.\n  - Avoids Snake #1\u2019s potential **UP** to **(9,3)** (collision risk), but Snake #1 would die if it moves there, so it\u2019s unlikely to do so.\n  - Keeps future options open (e.g., pivoting to **(7,0)** or **(2,1)**).\n\n---\n**Rationale for Turn 14:**\n- **DOWN** is the safest and most efficient path to **(9,3)**. Snake #1 cannot block this apple unless it moves **UP** to **(9,3)**, which would result in a collision and Snake #1\u2019s death. Thus, Snake #1 will avoid this.\n- **LEFT** to **(9,5)** is safe but unnecessary\u2014it doesn\u2019t advance toward any apples and limits future flexibility.\n- **RIGHT** to **(9,7)** is safe but delays progress toward **(9,3)** and doesn\u2019t secure any apples.\n\n---\n**Future Plan:**\n- **Turn 15:** After eating **(9,3)**, assess Snake #1\u2019s new position. If it\u2019s at **(9,3)**, I must move **LEFT** to **(9,2)** to avoid collision. Otherwise, move toward **(7,0)** or **(2,1)** based on enemy movements.\n- **Turn 16+:** Prioritize **(7,0)** (safe, low-contest) or **(2,1)** (less contested but farther). Monitor Snake #1\u2019s head at **(9,2)**\u2014if it moves **UP** to **(9,3)**, it\u2019s dead, so I can safely move there. If it moves **LEFT** to **(8,2)**, I can pivot toward **(7,0)**.\n\n---\nDOWN",

Snake #1\u2019s head is at **(9, 5)** (assuming it moved **UP** from **(9, 4)** or **RIGHT** from **(9, 4)**). Its body is at **(9, 4), (9, 3)**.\n   - **Apple Priorities:** The closest and safest apple is **(7, 0)**. Snake #1\u2019s body is at **(9, 4)**, so it could expand **DOWN** to **(8, 4)** or **LEFT** to **(9, 3)** (already occupied) or **RIGHT** to **(9, 5)** (current head position).\n   - **Move Toward (7, 0):** To reach **(7, 0)**, I need to move **DOWN** to **(6, 2)** or **LEFT** to **(7, 1)**. Snake #1\u2019s body is at **(9, 4)**, so it cannot block **(7, 0)** immediately, but it could pivot toward **(7, 0)** if it moves **DOWN** to **(8, 4)** and then **LEFT** to **(7, 4)**.\n   - **Avoid (2, 1) and (3, 0):** These are farther and more contested. Snake #1 could move toward **(2, 1)** if it pivots left.\n\n2. **Enemy Analysis:**\n   - Snake #1\u2019s head is at **(9, 5)**. It likely moved **UP** from **(9, 4)** (since **(9, 3)** is occupied by its body). Its body is at **(9, 4), (9, 3)**, so it could expand **UP** to **(8, 5)** or **DOWN** to **(9, 4)** (already occupied) or **LEFT** to **(9, 4)** (occupied) or **RIGHT** to **(9, 6)**.\n   - If Snake #1 moves **UP** to **(8, 5)**, it could threaten **(7, 0)** by moving **LEFT** to **(7, 5)** or **DOWN** to **(8, 4)**.\n   - If Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to **(9, 6)**, it could block **(9, 6)** apple but not **(7, 0)**.\n\n3. **Safe Moves for Me:**\n   - **DOWN** to **(6, 2)** (safe, no immediate threats).\n   - **LEFT** to **(7, 1)** (safe, closer to **(7, 0)**).\n   - **RIGHT** to **(7, 3)** (safe but delays progress toward **(7, 0)**).\n   - **UP** to **(7, 3)** (safe but unnecessary).\n\n4. **Best Move: LEFT to (7, 1)**\n   - This moves me closer to **(7, 0)** while avoiding Snake #1\u2019s likely path (it\u2019s at **(9, 5)** and expanding up or right).\n   - If Snake #1 moves **UP** to **(8, 5)**, it won\u2019t block **(7, 0)** immediately.\n   - Keeps flexibility to pivot toward **(7, 0)** in future turns.\n\n5. **Future Plan:**\n   - **Turn 17:** After moving to **(7, 1)**, assess Snake #1\u2019s new position. If it\u2019s at **(8, 5)**, move **DOWN** to **(6, 1)** or **LEFT** to **(7, 0)** to approach **(7, 0)**.\n   - **Turn 18+:** Prioritize **(7, 0)**. If Snake #1 starts contesting it, pivot toward **(3, 0)** as a backup.\n\n---\n**Analysis for Turn 17:**\n- **Current State:**\n  - My snake: Head at **(7, 2)**, body none. Apples left: **(7, 0)**, **(2, 1)**, **(3, 0)**, **(9, 6)**.\n  - Enemy (Snake #1): Head at **(9, 5)**, body at **(9, 4), (9, 3)**. Likely to move **UP** to **(8, 5)** or **RIGHT** to **(9, 6)**.\n- **Safe Moves for Me:** **DOWN** to **(6, 2)**, **LEFT** to **(7, 1)**, **RIGHT** to **(7, 3)**, **UP** to **(7, 3)**.\n- **Best Move:** **LEFT** to **(7, 1)**.\n  - Moves me closer to **(7, 0)** while avoiding Snake #1\u2019s likely expansion.\n  - **DOWN** to **(6, 2)** is safe but doesn\u2019t advance toward apples.\n  - **RIGHT** and **UP** are safe but don\u2019t help progress toward **(7, 0)**.\n\n---\nLEFT",
