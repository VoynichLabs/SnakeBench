Moving RIGHT to (2, 4) is a direct path towards this apple. It is a safe move, avoiding walls, my own body (which is now at (0, 4)), and the enemy snake at (2, 9). Moving RIGHT puts me one step away from the target apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If successful, my head will be at (2, 4) and my body at (1, 4). I will be one step directly above the apple at (2, 3). Assuming the apple is still there and the path is clear, my next move will likely be DOWN to collect it.\n\nNext Move: RIGHT"
