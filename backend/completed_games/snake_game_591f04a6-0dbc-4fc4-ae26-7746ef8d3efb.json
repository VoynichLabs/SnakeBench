I must move upwards and leftward toward this apple. \n- First step towards going from (8,2) to (7,7) would logically be moving UP to gradually approach this apple vertically, then later move LEFT when aligned vertically or as needed.\n\nCheck safety of immediate surroundings:\n- Moving UP from (8,2) to (8,3) is safe\u2014no walls or snakes there.\n\nStrategy note for next turns:\n- Continue moving up until aligning with y = 7, then shift horizontally left toward apple (7,7).\n\nFinal decision for this turn: \nUP"

Thus, the reassessment written in the \"last move information\" (claiming head at (7,5), body at [(8,5),(8,4)]) seems incorrect or is outdated. Let's trust the explicitly stated current position provided at the start of this prompt.\n- Our current head is at (7,6), so we must plan from there.\n- The closest apple is at (7,7), directly above our current head position, which means the apple is just one square above us at (7,7). We can easily obtain this apple in the immediate next turn by moving UP to position (7,7).\n- Checking for safety:\n  - Moving UP brings our head to (7,7), which currently holds an available apple. So it's guaranteed safe and indeed beneficial (we'll grow and gain 1 point immediately).\n- No immediate threats from enemy snake #0 (current position at (1,1)); this is very far away.\n- Nothing else blocks the path or poses threats nearby.\n\nConclusion:\n- The safest, most logical, and beneficial step next is obviously moving UP to grab the apple at (7, 7), immediately gaining a point and growing our snake.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\n- After grabbing the apple, choose the next apple target carefully considering places of apples at (1,7), (4,0), (5,2), and (8,2).

Let's verify clearly once again:\n\nCurrently:\n- Our head is at (5,3).\n- Our body now occupies positions [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]. We can't move onto these positions.\n- Apples remain at positions: (1, 7), (8, 2), (9, 9), (3, 2), (2, 2). Notice: the apple previously listed at (5,2) is no longer on this list of apples. Instead, Snake #0 occupies (5,2) right now. This means the apple we were targeting has been consumed or otherwise has disappeared and we must adjust plans immediately.\n\nEnemy Snake:\n- Snake #0 head is now at (5,2) (directly below us). Its body is at [(4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (3,0)]. It moved upward onto our intended apple position. This means we cannot move DOWN.\n\nNow we must reconsider carefully given the considerable change in circumstances:\n\nPossible moves from (5,3):\n- DOWN (5,2): Occupied by snake #0. Immediate collision, absolutely not safe.\n- UP (5,4): Occupied by our own body segment, not safe.\n- RIGHT (6,3): empty and safe. Good move to reposition ourselves.\n- LEFT (4,3): empty and safe. Good alternative to reposition ourselves as well.\n\nThus, realistically we only have RIGHT or LEFT as viable moves now.\n\nConsidering apples positions:\n- Apples cluster at the left-bottom (3,2 and 2,2 are not far away), and another apple at (8,2) towards our right-bottom side, and (1,7) being far top-left and (9,9) top-right corners.\n- Snake #0 is blocking directly below us somewhat on our left at (4,2). Hence we need to avoid immediate confrontation there if not clearly beneficial for now.\n\nMoving LEFT places us at (4,3), adjacent and above enemy snake head (5,2). This maneuver is somewhat risky because snake #0 might move up again to (5,3) or horizontally next turn, possibly cornering us quickly.\n\nRIGHT move positions us at (6,3); we have more open spaces at RIGHT side and less potential risks of immediate confrontation. Also, RIGHT positions us closer to apple at (8,2).\n\nGiven these considerations, RIGHT seems significantly safer and strategically beneficial now. \n\nStrategy reminder to myself next turn:\n- After moving RIGHT, carefully evaluate the enemy snake again.\n- Aim for apple at (8,2), cautiously.\n\nFinal decision for this move: RIGHT"

SAFE immediate move.\n- LEFT (7,3): Our body is here. NOT SAFE.\n- UP (8,4): Free, open square. SAFE immediate move.\n- DOWN (8,2): Occupied by head of enemy (#0). NOT SAFE (immediate collision).\n\nSo we have two safe immediate moves:\n- RIGHT (9,3) or UP (8,4)\n\nNow let's consider strategy:\n\n- We want apples for points. Where are closest apples to our current position (8,3)?\n  Closest apples: (3,2),(2,2) both left-bottom (but tricky area), (1,7),(0,7) top-left, (9,9) top-right (far but easy accessibility).\n- Going UP (8,4) leads toward open upper spaces, probably safest longer-term route toward (9,9) at the top.\n- Going RIGHT (9,3) leads closer to the edge at the right side. Next step after RIGHT would be UP(9,4)/DOWN(9,2), but DOWN(9,2) gets dangerous with snake #0 nearby at (8,2). RIGHT is less open extra space afterward; it limits our future moves slightly.\n\nConsidering snake #0:\n- Snake #0 currently at (8,2) moving horizontally towards apples at (3,2),(2,2): might be busy going left/down. This means (9,3) RIGHT move is somewhat safe in the immediate future but space starts getting limited.\n\nAssessing carefully again, UP seems to offer more paths forward since it leads into open territory in upper area (8,4). From there, we can keep heading upward towards apple (9,9), while maintaining flexibility.\n\nStrategic note for next turn:\n- Aim upwards and toward apple (9,9), as it offers an uncontested apple location at moment. Avoid getting trapped by corners or enemy snakes.\n\nThus, considering both immediate safety and longer-term strategic safety, the best decision is clearly to move UP.\n\nFinal decision this move: UP"

NOT SAFE.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Open and safe.\n- RIGHT to (9,5): Open and safe currently.\n\nThus, we have options UP, LEFT, and RIGHT immediately clear and safe.\n\nCheck apples again closely:\n- (9,9): upper right corner. Still clearly reachable and nearest viable apple.\n- (1,7),(0,7): upper-left region, farther away.\n- (2,2),(3,2): near bottom-left, close to enemy snake #0.

Thus, the top-right apple (9,9) remains uncontested at present, providing low competition.\n\nStrategically again:\n- Continuing upward (8,6) makes clear progress toward goal (9,9).
