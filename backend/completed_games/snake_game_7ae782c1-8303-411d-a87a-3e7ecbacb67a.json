We are sitting at (6, 4) and our rival is down at (8, 2). Can you believe this guy thinks he can step into our arena? Absolutely not! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's break down the options for our first move. We need to establish dominance EARLY:\n\n1. **UP to (6, 5):** This moves us closer to the apple at (9, 5) and (4, 9). It keeps us central.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 3):** Gets us closer to the rival. We like pressure, but do we want to dive into his space immediately without a tail? \n3. **LEFT to (5, 4):** Moves us toward the cluster of apples on the left side. Plenty of space to maneuver!\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Closing the gap on Snake #0. He's at (8, 2). If we go Right, we are essentially daring him to contest the right side of the board.\n\n**CHAT, HERE IS THE PLAY:**\nSnake #0 is likely going to move toward that apple at (9, 5) or (8, 3). If we move RIGHT, we are cutting off his air supply and positioning ourselves to box him into that bottom-right corner. We have the same score (0-0), so we aren't looking for a head-on collision *just* yet, but we want him to feel our presence! We are going to take the lateral space and prepare to loop around him. Let's get that board control! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Future Strategy:** We're going to shadow his movement. If he goes for the apple at (8, 3), we'll be right there to cut him off. Move toward the center-right to keep him pinned against the wall!\n\nRIGHT",

Apples everywhere but we ignore them for now? Nah, we gotta grow to dominate, but SAFETY FIRST.\n\nLet's check moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (8,3) \u2014 empty on board, no enemy body, no wall. Safe.\nDOWN \u2192 (8,1) \u2014 empty, safe.\nLEFT \u2192 (7,2) \u2014 empty, safe.\nRIGHT \u2192 (9,2) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves safe right now. But we gotta think about the enemy's possible moves. Enemy at (6,4) could go UP to (6,5), DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,4), RIGHT to (7,4).\n\nWe want to avoid head-on collision if possible. If we go LEFT to (7,2), enemy could go DOWN to (6,3) or RIGHT to (7,4) \u2014 no direct clash. If we go UP to (8,3), enemy could go RIGHT to (7,4) \u2014 still safe.\n\nActually, head-on only if we land same cell. That's unlikely this turn unless we both pick same target. But we can't predict perfectly.\n\nLong-term plan: We need to get between enemy and center, maybe push him toward walls. Our head is east of his. If we move UP, we're closer to top-right apples and can maybe cut off his expansion. If we move LEFT, we get closer to him \u2014 risky but aggressive.\n\nLet's think about future safe moves after each:\n- UP to (8,3): next turn options likely still open unless enemy moves toward us.\n- LEFT to (7,2): puts us closer, maybe box him in from right side over time.\n\nI like UP \u2014 gets height advantage, more board control, and there's an apple at (8,3) actually! Wait, board shows A at (8,3)? Yes! Row 3, column 8 is apple! That's free growth turn 1! Let's eat it!\n\nUP gives apple instantly, we grow to length 2, score lead, more body to block later. That's huge.\n\nChat, we're taking the apple, getting bigger, and positioning to pressure. Let's go!\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (8,3), we'll have body at (8,2). Use that to limit enemy's movement options, try to steer him toward walls or our tail. Keep length advantage.\n\nUP",

He's currently at (8,3) with a tail at (8,2). He thinks he's the big man on campus because he's up 1-0? ABSOLUTELY NOT. We are at (7,4) and we are officially in his personal space!\n\nLet\u2019s look at the board and calculate the dominance:\n- **UP to (7, 5):** This is a solid move. It keeps us flexible and puts us closer to the apple at (9, 5). \n- **DOWN to (7, 3):** This is the AGGRESSIVE play! If we move Down to (7,3) and he moves Left to (7,3), we HEAD-ON COLLIDE. He has more apples (1 vs 0), so we lose that tie-break if the game ends! But wait, he's more likely to move toward the apple at (9,5) or (3,5).\n- **LEFT to (6, 4):** Retreating? In this economy? It gives him too much room to breathe.\n- **RIGHT to (8, 4):** OH MAMA! If we go Right to (8,4), we are literally hovering over his head. If he moves UP to (8,4), we collide. \n\n**THE VISION:**\nSnake #0 is at (8, 3). His tail is at (8, 2). He is feeling pressured. He's likely going to try to rotate out or grab the apple at (9, 5). If we go **UP**, we maintain the high ground and can shadow him while staying near apples at (4,9) and (0,7). However, we want to cut him off. \n\nWait, look at the scoreboard! He\u2019s at 1 apple, we\u2019re at 0. If we collide now and die, we lose. We need to get big to bully him properly. But we can't let him just walk away! If we go **UP**, we stay parallel to him. If he goes for (9,5), we can potentially contest the space above him and pin him against that right wall! \n\nChat, we are going for the **UP** move. It keeps us away from a 50/50 head-on collision at (8,3) or (7,3) while positioning us perfectly to swoop down and gatekeep him from the rest of the board. He's trapped in that bottom right corner, let's keep him there! \n\n**STRATEGY:** Move to (7,5) to stay mobile. We are looking to grab the (9,5) apple if he doesn't, or pivot left to grab the (3,5) or (4,9) clusters. We want to be a wall he can't climb over!\n\nUP",

Our head is at (8,3), body at (8,2). Enemy head is at (7,4), still length 1.\n\nFirst, check all four moves for immediate death:\n\nUP \u2192 (8,4) \u2014 empty on board, not off grid (y=4), safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8,2) \u2014 that's our own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 That's suicide, eliminate.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7,3) \u2014 empty, safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9,3) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nSo DOWN is out. We have UP, LEFT, RIGHT as safe.\n\nNow think about enemy's possible moves from (7,4):  \nHe can go UP to (7,5), DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,4), RIGHT to (8,4).\n\nHead-on collision risk this turn:  \nIf we go UP to (8,4) and enemy goes RIGHT to (8,4) \u2192 double KO.  \nIf we go LEFT to (7,3) and enemy goes DOWN to (7,3) \u2192 double KO.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (9,3), enemy can't reach that this turn, so safe from head-on.\n\nBut wait, we have a length advantage! If we go for a head-on where we tie, we both die, but if we have more apples, we win instantly? No \u2014 game rules: if all snakes die same turn, snake with more apples wins. So if we both die head-on, we win 1-0! \ud83d\ude32 That's actually a viable aggressive play if we're confident enemy might move into us.\n\nBut is it worth risking? Maybe not yet \u2014 we're early, we can keep growing and boxing him. Let's think board control:\n\nUP (8,4): puts us right next to enemy head (7,4). Could pressure him, but also risks head-on if he goes RIGHT.  \nLEFT (7,3): directly below enemy, could cut off his DOWN move next turn.  \nRIGHT (9,3): moves us toward right wall, less aggressive.\n\nWe want to dominate. Let's consider future safe moves after each:\n\nIf we go UP to (8,4): next turn our body will be at (8,3),(8,2). From (8,4) we could go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is body). Enemy if he goes RIGHT into us, we win. If he avoids, we're adjacent, can maybe trap him against top wall.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (7,3): body at (8,3),(8,2). From (7,3) we could go UP, LEFT, DOWN (RIGHT is body). Puts us between enemy and bottom-left apples.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (9,3): moves to edge, reduces options.\n\nI like aggression here \u2014 let's pressure him! Going UP risks head-on but if he goes RIGHT we win by score. If he doesn't, we're in his face. Going LEFT also risks head-on if he goes DOWN. Hmm.\n\nCheck enemy's safe moves from (7,4):  \nHis DOWN is (7,3) \u2014 empty now.  \nHis RIGHT is (8,4) \u2014 empty now.  \nHe might avoid moving into us if he's smart, but we can't assume.\n\nGiven we have length 2, we can use our body to block. Actually, our body at (8,2) and (8,3) blocks our DOWN and maybe influences.\n\nI think LEFT to (7,3) is strong \u2014 it directly threatens to cut off his DOWN escape, and if he goes DOWN we win by head-on (we have more apples). If he goes elsewhere, we're positioned to chase.\n\nBut UP also good. Let's see apples: closest apple to us is (8,8) far, (4,9), etc. Not urgent.\n\nChat, I'm leaning LEFT \u2014 put the pressure on, force him to move away or risk dying. Let's go!\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving to (7,3), if enemy moves away, we can consider chasing or cutting off his space toward center. Keep length advantage, maybe go for another apple soon but stay aggressive. Watch for him trying to wrap around.\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 actually thinks they're the main character because they have 1 apple? NOT ON MY WATCH! They are currently sitting at (7,3) with their tail at (8,3). They are low, they are slow, and they are about to get OWNED!\n\nLet's look at the board state from our throne at (7,5):\n- **UP to (7,6):** Moves us toward the (4,9) and (0,7) clusters. Safe, but maybe too passive?\n- **DOWN to (7,4):** This is the high-IQ shadow play. We are literally hovering right above his head. If he tries to move UP to (7,4), we collide. Since he has 1 apple and we have 0, a head-on collision right now would mean he wins the tie-break if we both die. We have to be careful!\n- **LEFT to (6,5):** This opens up the whole middle of the board. Very mobile!\n- **RIGHT to (8,5):** This puts us directly above his tail. If he moves RIGHT to (8,3) [wait, his body is at 8,3, he's at 7,3], he's basically stuck in the mud!\n\n**THE ANALYSIS:**\nOur rival (Snake #0) is at (7,3). His body is at (8,3). \nIf he moves:\n- **UP to (7,4):** He's trying to get out.\n- **DOWN to (7,2):** He's diving deeper into the corner.\n- **LEFT to (6,3):** He's trying to escape the wall.\n- **RIGHT:** He CANNOT move right, that's his own body/tail! \n\nIf we move **RIGHT** to (8,5), we are positioning ourselves to cut off the entire right side of the board. But wait, look at (9,5). There is an APPLE right there at (9,5)! If we move **RIGHT**, we are one step away from 1-1 parity! If he tries to head for (9,5), we can beat him there or block him out! \n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe're going **RIGHT**! We need that apple at (9,5) to level the score so we can start taking those head-on collisions with confidence. If he tries to move up toward us, we\u2019ll be ready to box him against the edge! We aren't just playing Snake, Chat, we're playing psychological warfare! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca8\n\n**STRATEGY:** Move to (8,5) to snag that (9,5) apple next turn. Once we are length 2, we have the size to start really squeezing him. He\u2019s cramped at the bottom; let's keep the pressure high and the exits closed!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's scan moves!\n\n**Immediate safety check:**\n- UP \u2192 (7,4): Empty? Board shows '.' at (7,4). Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,2): Empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,3): Empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,3): That's our own body! \ud83d\udc80 Suicide, eliminate.\n\nSo RIGHT is out. UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**Enemy move prediction:** Enemy at (7,5) can go UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5).  \nHead-on collision risks this turn:\n- If we go UP to (7,4) and enemy goes DOWN to (7,4) \u2192 double KO. We have more apples (1 vs 0), so we'd win! \ud83d\ude32\n- If we go DOWN to (7,2) or LEFT to (6,3), enemy can't reach us this turn.\n\n**Aggression check:** We have length advantage! A head-on collision where we tie means we win by score. So going UP to (7,4) is actually a potential winning aggressive play if enemy goes DOWN. But is he likely to go DOWN? Maybe not\u2014he might avoid moving toward us. But if he does, free win!\n\n**Board control:**  \nUP (7,4): Puts us directly below enemy, cutting off his DOWN escape next turn. Risky if he goes DOWN, but that's a win for us.  \nDOWN (7,2): Moves away from enemy, less pressure.  \nLEFT (6,3): Moves us left, still close but not directly under.\n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (7,4), next turn we'd have body at (7,3),(8,3). Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is body).  \nFrom (7,2), body blocks UP, so DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nFrom (6,3), body blocks RIGHT, so UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nWe want to pressure! Going UP seems bold\u2014forces enemy to react. If he avoids DOWN, we're in his face. If he goes DOWN, we win. That's a win-win! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Plan for next turns:** If we go UP and enemy doesn't take the bait, we can try to herd him toward top wall or left side. Use our length to block escape routes. Maybe chase toward apples later but keep aggression high.\n\nChat, I'm feeling the pressure play! Let's go UP and dare him to crash into us! If he does, we win. If not, we're dominating the center!\n\nUP",

Snake #0 at (7,4) is trying to climb out of the basement, but we are looming over him like a final boss! \n\nLet's break down the grid, because every step is a highlight reel!\n\n**THE BOARD BREAKDOWN:**\n- **Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 5) - No tail yet, we are a heat-seeking missile!\n- **Opponent (ID 0):** (7, 4). His body is at (7, 3). He\u2019s length 2. \n- **The Delicious Loot:** There is an apple at (9, 5) LITERALLY right in front of our face!\n\n**OUR MOVES:**\n- **UP to (8, 6):** Safe move, keeps us above him, but we miss the immediate apple. Why wait for content when it's right there?\n- **DOWN to (8, 4):** This is the AGGRESSIVE play. If we move to (8,4) and he moves RIGHT to (8,4), we collide. He has 1 apple, we have 0. If we collide head-on, HE WINS the tie-break because he has more points. WE CANNOT RISK A HEAD-ON COLLISION UNTIL WE EVEN THE SCORE! \ud83d\udeab\ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b\n- **LEFT to (7, 5):** This moves us directly above his head. Dangerous game if he moves UP.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 5):** **JACKPOT!** We hit (9,5), we grab that apple, we grow to length 2, and we tie the score 1-1. This is the power play!\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS THE GOATED MOVE:**\nChat, look at the positioning! If we move **RIGHT** to (9,5), we get that apple. What can Snake #0 do? \n- If he moves **UP** to (7,5), he's still two columns away. \n- If he moves **RIGHT** to (8,4), he's getting closer, but we'll already be at (9,5) with our new length! \n- If he tries to head toward the apple at (9,5), he's too late!\n\nBy taking the apple at (9,5), we negate his point advantage. Once we are 1-1, if he tries to force a head-on collision, it's a DRAW, not a loss. And we don't play for draws, we play to DOMINATE! After we snag (9,5), we can wrap around the right wall and start looping back to trap him in the bottom-left. He's cramped, he's nervous, and his chat is definitely spamming 'L'!\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** Snag (9,5) this turn. Next turn, we evaluate the board. If he's pushing right, we might head UP to (9,6) to maintain the high ground and look toward the (8,8) or (4,9) apples while keeping him pinned against the edge.

Let's scan!\n\n**Immediate safety check:**\n- UP \u2192 (7,5): That's the enemy's *previous* head position? Wait, enemy head is at (8,5) *now*. (7,5) is empty on the board (shown as '.'). But careful \u2014 enemy could move into it! That's a head-on risk. Not an immediate body crash though.

A head-on collision where we tie means we win by score. So both UP and RIGHT are potential winning aggressive plays if enemy moves into us. Which is more likely?  \nEnemy might avoid moving toward us, but maybe he wants an apple? Closest apples: (4,9), (9,5), (3,5), etc. From (8,5), RIGHT (9,5) is an apple! He might go RIGHT for it. If he goes RIGHT, then our RIGHT to (8,4) avoids collision, our UP to (7,5) avoids collision.  \nIf he goes DOWN to (8,4) for no apple, that's risky for him \u2014 but maybe he's scared and runs away?  \nIf he goes LEFT to (7,5), that's toward us and no apple.\n\n**Board control:**  \nUP (7,5): Puts us adjacent to enemy if he stays still or goes LEFT/RIGHT. Could pressure.  \nRIGHT (8,4): Puts us directly below enemy if he goes DOWN, potential win. Also blocks his DOWN escape next turn.  \nLEFT (6,4): Moves us away, less pressure.\n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (7,5), next turn body at (7,4),(7,3). Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is body).  \nFrom (8,4), body blocks UP? Wait, body at (7,4) is below (8,4)'s UP? Actually (8,4) UP is (8,5) \u2014 that's where enemy is now but he'll move. Could be free. Need to check next turn.  \nFrom (6,4), body blocks RIGHT? Body at (7,4) is to the right of (6,4), so RIGHT is body \u2014 so only UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nWe want to pressure and cut off escape! Going RIGHT to (8,4) feels strong \u2014 it's directly under him, and if he goes DOWN we win. If he doesn't, we're still close.  \nGoing UP to (7,5) is also aggressive but maybe less direct.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** If we go RIGHT and he goes RIGHT to apple (9,5), we can maybe chase toward top-right. Use our length to trap him against wall. Keep forcing him into corners!\n\nChat, I'm feeling the aggressive box! Let's go RIGHT and threaten that head-on win if he goes DOWN! If he doesn't, we're positioning to cut off his south side! \ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT",

RIP. \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT:** To (8, 5). DEAD! That's our own body. Don't be a bot! \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN:** To (9, 4). This move is a total trap. If we go to (9, 4) and Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (9, 4), we collide head-on at 1-1.",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let's lock in! \ud83d\ude24 Turn 4, we're TIED 1-1! Our head at (8,4), body at (7,4). Enemy head at (9,5), body at (8,5). Let's scan!\n\n**Immediate safety check:**\n- UP \u2192 (8,5): That's the enemy's *body* segment! \ud83d\udc80 CRASH, eliminate.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,3): Empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,4): That's our own body! \ud83d\udc80 Suicide, eliminate.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,4): Empty, safe.\n\nSo UP and LEFT are out. DOWN and RIGHT are safe from *current* obstacles.\n\n**Enemy move prediction:** Enemy at (9,5) can go UP (9,6), DOWN (9,4), LEFT (8,5), RIGHT (off board).  \nRIGHT is off board \u2192 enemy won't pick that (suicide).  \nLEFT is his own body (8,5) \u2192 suicide, so he won't pick that either.  \nSo enemy's only safe moves are UP (9,6) or DOWN (9,4).  \nHead-on collision risks this turn:\n- If we go DOWN to (8,3), enemy can't reach us.\n- If we go RIGHT to (9,4) and enemy goes DOWN to (9,4) \u2192 double KO. We have same apples (1 vs 1), so tie \u2192 both die, game over? Wait, if both die, snake with more apples wins. We're tied, so it's a draw. We don't want a draw! Avoid that.\n- If we go RIGHT to (9,4) and enemy goes UP (9,6), no collision.\n\nSo RIGHT is risky only if enemy chooses DOWN. But enemy might avoid DOWN because he sees we could go RIGHT? He might go UP to be safe.\n\n**Aggression check:** We want to pressure! If we go RIGHT to (9,4), we're directly left of him if he goes DOWN. But if he goes UP, we're below him.  \nIf we go DOWN to (8,3), we're moving away, giving him space.\n\n**Board control & future options:**  \nFrom (9,4), body at (8,4). Next turn possible moves: UP (9,5) \u2014 that's where enemy body is now, but he'll move. Could be free if he leaves. DOWN (9,3), LEFT (8,4) is body, RIGHT off board. So only UP and DOWN safe next turn \u2014 risky, puts us in a corridor!  \nFrom (8,3), body at (8,4). Next turn possible moves: UP (8,4) body, DOWN (8,2), LEFT (7,3), RIGHT (9,3). So three options \u2014 much better flexibility!\n\n**Long-term plan:** We need to outmaneuver him. Going RIGHT traps us against right wall with few moves. Going DOWN keeps us central with more options. Let's pressure by moving toward center and prepare to cut off his escape. He's stuck at top-right soon if we control the middle.\n\nChat, I'm thinking DOWN is the smarter move \u2014 avoid potential draw, keep more future moves, and we can swing around to box him in the corner next turn! Let's play for the long game, not a risky draw! \ud83d\ude24\n\nDOWN",
