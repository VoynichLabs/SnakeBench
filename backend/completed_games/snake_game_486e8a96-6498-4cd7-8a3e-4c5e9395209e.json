This is unnecessarily constraining.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,2): Safe, keeps 3 follow-ups, and opens a corridor above your horizontal body via (5,3). It also positions you to race for the contested apple at (6,5).\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,1): Safe, immediately eats the apple at (4,1), keeps 3 follow-ups next turn, and keeps you in the lower half, away from the enemy.\n\nApple and collision considerations:\n- The apple at (6,5) is exactly 5 moves away from both you (from (4,2)) and the enemy (from (5,9)). If you steer toward it via RIGHT/UP, you risk a future contested approach and potential head-on in the central corridor.\n- Going DOWN now:\n  - Gives you a guaranteed apple immediately.\n  - Naturally makes you slower to (6,5), so you are less likely to enter a risky race for it.\n  - Still leaves a clear, safe route to (7,2) in a few moves (e.g., from (4,1): RIGHT along the bottom, then up), while your tail retracts and opens more space behind you.\n\nLEFT is clearly inferior due to reduced options. BETWEEN DOWN and RIGHT, DOWN is better because it:\n- Secures an uncontested apple right away.\n- Keeps you in the safer, less crowded lower region.\n- Avoids committing to the contested central apple at (6,5) where a head-on with a leading opponent would be catastrophic (they win ties if both die the same turn).\n\nPlan to future self:\n- Take DOWN now to grab (4,1).\n- Then work rightward through the bottom/low-middle toward (7,2), watching how the enemy approaches (6,5). Prefer routes that keep you away from direct head-on lines with their head while accumulating the easy southern apples.\n\nDOWN",

It\u2019s clearly weaker than LEFT in terms of both apples and board control.\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- From (9,8), enemy can only move to (9,9) or (8,8); both are far from our intended move at (6,4), so there is no collision risk this turn.\n- Even if they later race for (8,5), we will see their approach in time and can choose whether to contest or avoid a risky head-on.\n\nPlan for next few turns (to future self):\n- Take (6,4) now.\n- From (6,4), prioritize UP to (6,5) for the second central apple if enemy is still high and right; that should bring us to 10 apples with three safe exits (toward 5,5,7,5,6,6).\n- After securing 6,4 and 6,5, evaluate enemy trajectory:\n  * If they drop toward 8,5 along the 8-column, avoid a forced head-on at (8,5); we don\u2019t need that apple badly enough to risk a draw.\n  * Otherwise, swing through 7,5 toward 8,5, then consider shifting left toward (2,4)/(0,6) while keeping our head above our body stack for maximum flexibility.\n\nLEFT",
