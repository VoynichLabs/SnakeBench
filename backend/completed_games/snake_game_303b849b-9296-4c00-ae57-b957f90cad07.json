They could move toward the apple at (8, 0) or (0, 3)/(0, 4)\n- If I move LEFT to (4, 6), I can eat the apple and grow, which is the best immediate outcome\n\n**Best Move Analysis:**\n1.

UP: (5, 8) - This is my body! Would kill me.\n2. DOWN: (5, 6) - This is enemy body! Would kill me.\n3. LEFT: (4, 7) - This is my body! Would kill me.\n4. RIGHT: (6, 7) - This is enemy head! Would cause head-on collision and both die.\n\nWait a minute, this is concerning. All four possible moves seem to lead to death:\n- UP: into my own body\n- DOWN: into enemy body\n- LEFT: into my own body\n- RIGHT: into enemy head (head-on collision)\n\nBut this can't be right - I must be missing something. Let me re-examine the board state carefully.\n\nLooking at the board:\n```\n 9 T T T T . . A . . .\n 8 T T T T T . . . A .\n 7 T T T . T 1 0 . A .\n 6 T . . . T T T . . .\n 5 . . . . T T . . . .\n 4 . . . T T T . . . .\n 3 . . . T . T . . . A\n 2 . . . T T T . . . .\n 1 . . . . T T . . . .\n 0 . A . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head is at (5,7) - let me verify the body positions:\n- (5,7) is head\n- (4,7) is first body segment (LEFT)\n- (4,8) is next (UP from (4,7))\n- And so on...\n\nEnemy head is at (6,7) - let me verify:\n- (6,7) is head\n- (6,6) is first body segment (DOWN)\n- (5,6) is next (LEFT from (6,6))\n- And so on...\n\nSo indeed:\n- UP from (5,7) would go to (5,8) - but my body is at (4,8), not (5,8). Let me check the board again.\n- DOWN from (5,7) would go to (5,6) - enemy body is at (5,6)\n- LEFT from (5,7) would go to (4,7) - my body is at (4,7)\n- RIGHT from (5,7) would go to (6,7) - enemy head is at (6,7)\n\nThis seems like a deadlock situation. But wait - let me double-check the board representation. The board shows:\n- Row 7: T T T . T 1 0 . A .\n- So at (5,7) is '1' (my head)\n- At (6,7) is '0' (enemy head)\n- At (4,7) is 'T' (my body)\n- At (5,6) is 'T' (enemy body)\n\nThis confirms all four moves would be fatal. But this can't be right - there must be an error in my interpretation.\n\nWait! Looking at the board more carefully:\n- The 'T' symbols represent body segments\n- The numbers '1' and '0' represent heads\n- The '.' symbols are empty spaces\n\nSo at (5,7) is my head (1)\nAt (6,7) is enemy head (0)\nAt (4,7) is my body (T)\nAt (5,6) is enemy body (T)\n\nBut what about (5,8)? The board shows row 8: T T T T T . . . A .\nSo (5,8) is '.' - empty space!\n\nI made a mistake earlier - UP from (5,7) would go to (5,8), not (5,8) being my body. My body is at (4,8), not (5,8).\n\nLet me re-evaluate all moves:\n\n1. UP: (5,8) - Looking at board, this is '.' (empty). Safe!\n2. DOWN: (5,6) - Enemy body (T). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (4,7) - My body (T). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (6,7) - Enemy head (0). Head-on collision. Unsafe.\n\nSo only UP is safe!\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- UP to (5,8): No immediate apple, but moves toward apple at (8,8)\n- This is the only safe move available\n\n**Enemy Movement Consideration:**\n- Enemy is at (6,7). They could move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT\n- If they move LEFT to (5,7), that would be into my current position (but I'll be moving UP)\n- If they move UP to (6,8), that's safe for them\n- If they move DOWN to (6,6), that's their body\n- If they move RIGHT to (7,7), that's safe\n\n**Best Move Analysis:**\n1. UP to (5,8):\n   - Only safe move available\n   - No immediate apple, but moves toward apple at (8,8)\n   - No risk of collision with enemy or myself\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\n- After this move, I'll be at (5,8) with my body stretching down to (0,6)\n- Need to find a way to move toward apples while maintaining safety\n- Should consider moving toward the apples at (8,7), (8,8), or (6,9) in the next few turns\n- Need to watch enemy movements carefully as we're very close\n- Should try to control the upper part of the board to limit enemy options\n\n**Final Decision:**\nUP (only safe move available)\n\nUP",

Among these, RIGHT is preferable as it continues toward the apple at (8,8), maintaining my eastward path and keeping options open for subsequent moves (e.g., DOWN to (8,8) next turn). This avoids potential crowding near my body and positions me away from the enemy's likely movements from (4,9).\n\n**START PLAN**  \nPrioritize reaching (8,8) next turn via RIGHT, then adjust based on board changes; if the enemy advances eastward, use the open space at (8,9) or (9,9) to circle around and target (8,7) or other apples.  \n**END PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

A .\n 7 . . T . T T T . A .\n 6 . . . . T T T . . .\n 5 . . . . T . . . . .\n 4 A . . T T T . . . .\n 3 . . . T . T . . . A\n 2 . . . T T T . . . .\n 1 . . . . T T . . . .\n 0 . A . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1. UP: (4, 10) - Off the board. Unsafe.\n2. DOWN: (4, 8) - This is my body (T). Unsafe.\n3. LEFT: (3, 9) - Looking at row 9, this is 'T' (my body). Unsafe.\n4. RIGHT: (5, 9) - This is my body (T). Unsafe.\n\nWait a minute, this seems problematic. All moves appear unsafe. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Row 9: \"T T T T 1 T T 0 . .\"\n- My head is at (4,9) which is '1' on the board\n- (3,9) is 'T' (my body)\n- (5,9) is 'T' (my body)\n- (4,8) is 'T' (my body)\n- (4,10) is off the board\n\nThis suggests I'm completely surrounded by my own body. But this can't be right - I must have made an error in interpreting the board.\n\nLooking more carefully at the board representation:\n- The board shows row 9 as: \"T T T T 1 T T 0 . .\"\n- My body is listed as: [(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7)]\n- So (3,9) should be part of my body (it is in the list)\n- (5,9) is also part of my body\n- (4,8) is part of my body\n- (4,10) is off the board\n\nThis means I'm completely boxed in by my own body. There are no safe moves available. This would mean I'm dead this turn.\n\nBut wait - let me check if I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly. The board shows:\n- Column 4, Row 9 is '1' (my head)\n- Column 3, Row 9 is 'T' (my body)\n- Column 5, Row 9 is 'T' (my body)\n- Column 4, Row 8 is 'T' (my body)\n\nThis confirms I'm completely surrounded. There are no safe moves.\n\nHowever, since this is a game and I need to make a move, I should choose the least bad option. But all options are equally bad (all result in death).\n\nGiven that I must choose a move, and all moves are unsafe, I'll choose one arbitrarily. But first, let me think if there's any way I could be misinterpreting the board.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n```\n 9 T T T T 1 T T 0 . .\n 8 T T T T T T T . A .\n 7 . . T . T T T . A .\n 6 . . . . T T T . . .\n 5 . . . . T . . . . .\n 4 A . . T T T . . . .\n 3 . . . T . T . . . A\n 2 . . . T T T . . . .\n 1 . . . . T T . . . .\n 0 . A . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nThe '1' at (4,9) is my head. The 'T's around it are indeed my body parts. There's no empty space adjacent to my head.\n\nThis is a very unfortunate situation. I appear to be completely trapped with no safe moves available.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nSince all moves are unsafe, I'll choose LEFT (even though it's into my body) as it's the first option.\n\nLEFT",
