My snake (Snake 1) is at `(8, 0)` and there are five apples on the board. My immediate goal is to safely capture as many apples as possible while avoiding the walls and the enemy snake (Snake 0) which is currently at `(0, 0)` and doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\nThe nearby apples are:\n1. `(8, 6)`  \n2. `(7, 7)`  \n3. `(7, 8)`  \n4. `(6, 3)`  \n5. `(6, 1)`  \n\n#### Strategy:\n- The closest apple is at `(6, 1)`, as it only requires moving left (to `(6, 0)`) and then moving up to `(6, 1)`. This will be my next target.\n- Additionally, I notice that I am already near the bottom of the board, so there is no immediate danger of hitting the wall downwards. Snake 0 is far away on the opposite corner, so I only need to focus on apples and avoid making reckless moves.\n- The primary strategy is to gradually make progress toward `(6, 1)` while leaving enough flexibility to adjust if another apple becomes more favorable.\n\n### Rationale:\nTo get closer to `(6, 1)`, my first move will need to reduce my x-coordinate from 8 to 7 and then further to 6 (moving left). Since I'm already on the bottom row, I can't go \"down,\" so my best initial move is LEFT.\n\n### Next move: LEFT"

But in this case, our snake is at (0,0), and moving RIGHT step by step does not immediately conflict.\n\nHowever, moving directly to (6,0) from (5,0) might be risky if the enemy occupies (6,0). But the enemy's position at (6,0) with body parts at [(6,0)] indicates their body is at that position, meaning they are occupying that cell.\n\nThus, moving into (6,0) would be a collision with the enemy snake.\n\nBest plan:\n\n- Move RIGHT four times to reach (4,0).\n- From there, move UP to (4,1), then continue RIGHT to (5,1), (6,1), collecting the apple at (6,1). This way, we avoid the enemy at (6,0), as we would never move into their position.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy's only position is at (6,0), and our goal is apples at (6,1) and (6,3), moving up from (5,0) might be better.\n\nMy current plan:\n\n- From (0,0), move RIGHT to (1,0).\n- Repeat RIGHT until (6,0), but since that overlaps with the enemy's position, avoid moving into (6,0).\n- Instead, from (5,0), move UP to (5,1), then RIGHT to (6,1) to grab the apple.\n- Afterwards, plan movement to (6,3).\n\nThus, the safest next move is to continue RIGHT from (1,0) to (5,0), avoiding (6,0), then move UP.\n\nGiven the options, the best next move:\n\n- **Next move: RIGHT**\n\nThis positions us closer to the apples, avoids enemy collision, and maintains a safe route.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

These two apples are clustered together and form my next logical targets.\n   - The apple at **(5, 6)** is also relatively close but requires careful routing to avoid self-collision.\n   - The apples at **(2, 4)** and **(8, 0)** are distant and lower priority for now.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake (Snake #0):**\n   - Snake #0 remains at **(9, 1)** with no body and doesn\u2019t pose an imminent threat. This allows me to focus solely on apple collection for now.\n\n4. **Board Constraints:**\n   - Moving downward to **(8, 5)** would result in self-collision, so DOWN is prohibited.\n   - Moving right to **(9, 6)** brings me closer to the wall, which is risky without a clear route back.\n   - Moving left to **(7, 6)** opens up a path toward the apples at **(7, 7)** and **(7, 8)**.\n   - Moving up to **(8, 7)** is also viable but would situate me further from the cluster of apples.\n\n#### **Threat Assessment**\n- **Self-Collision Threat:**\n  - As my snake continues to grow, it will become increasingly difficult to maneuver without trapping myself in.\n  - I need to focus on creating open paths and avoid dead ends, particularly in the top-right quadrant, where the wall is nearby.\n\n- **Enemy Threat:**\n  - Snake #0 is still far from my position and apples, so it remains a non-factor for now.\n  - I will continue to monitor its movements in case it begins competing for apples.\n\n#### **Next Move Planning**\nThe best strategic path is to move toward the cluster of apples at **(7, 7)** and **(7, 8)** while ensuring I maintain flexibility for future moves. \n\n1. **Immediate Move:**\n   - Move **LEFT** to **(7, 6)**. This brings me closer to the apples and keeps a clear route to either **(7, 7)** or **(7, 8)**.\n   - LEFT is safe because:\n     - **(7, 6)** is an empty tile.\n     - It avoids surrounding myself with my body or the wall.\n\n2. **Post-Move Plan:**\n   - After moving to **(7, 6)**, assess the situation:\n     - If Snake #0 begins moving aggressively, consider prioritizing apples further away from its path.\n     - Otherwise, move **UP** toward **(7, 7)** and **(7, 8)** to acquire more apples.\n\n3. **Long-Term Strategy:**\n   - Create room to avoid self-collisions as the snake grows. Ensure there is always a path back to open areas.\n   - Avoid getting too close to the right wall (**x = 9**) without an escape plan.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Move: LEFT**"
