This is a safe and rewarding move.\n- DOWN: Would move to (0, 7), which is where my body currently is, so this would kill me.\n- LEFT: Would hit the wall since I'm at x=0, so this would kill me.\n- RIGHT: Would move to (1, 8), which is empty and safe.\n\nOnly UP and RIGHT are valid moves. \n\nLooking at the apple locations:\n- There's an apple at (0, 9), which is directly above me.\n- Other apples are at (5, 2), (0, 0), (7, 9), and (2, 0).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0, 5), which is 3 squares below me, so it's not an immediate threat.\n\nMoving UP will immediately give me an apple, increasing my length and score.
