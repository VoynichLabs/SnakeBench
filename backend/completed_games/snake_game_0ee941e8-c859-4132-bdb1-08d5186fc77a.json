(unsafe)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 5) \u2014 empty. (safe)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 6) \u2014 empty. (safe)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 6) \u2014 empty. (safe)  \n\nSo UP is unsafe \u2192 eliminated.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy proximity:**  \nEnemy head at (4, 5) \u2192 distance |8-4| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 cells away. They cannot reach me in one move \u2014 no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples: (8, 4) distance 2, (8, 2) distance 4, (9, 3) distance 4. Immediate path: to eat (8, 4): DOWN twice from current position.  \nBest choice: move DOWN to (8, 5) this turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility check:**  \nFrom (8, 5): body would be [(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)]. Next turn possible moves (avoiding body): UP blocked by (8, 6), LEFT (7, 5) free, RIGHT (9, 5) free, DOWN (8, 4) free \u2192 3 moves available.  \nFrom LEFT (7, 6): body [(7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7)]. Next turn possible moves: UP (7, 7) free, DOWN (7, 5) free, LEFT (6, 6) free, RIGHT body blocked \u2192 3 moves available too.  \nRIGHT (9, 6): body [(9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7)]. Next turn possible moves: UP (9, 7) free, DOWN (9, 5) free, LEFT body blocked, RIGHT off board \u2192 2 moves available (worse).  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT both good mobility.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Final decision:**  \nApple proximity favors DOWN strongly. Avoids head-on possibility with enemy far away.  \n\nAlways prioritize undefeatable path to apple when safely available.\n\n**Plan next turn:**  \nNext turn: head to (8, 5), then aim to take DOWN again to (8, 4) to eat apple on turn 9. Keep enemy far away \u2014 they might go for (4, 4) apple.\n\nDOWN",

No \u2014 standard Snake: new head at apple, old head becomes first body segment, tail doesn\u2019t move. So body: [(8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5)].  \n\nNext turn from (8, 4): UP (8, 5) \u2014 my body \u2014 unsafe; DOWN (8, 3) free; LEFT (7, 4) body \u2014 unsafe; RIGHT (9, 4) free. Only 2 safe moves.  \n\nIf DOWN to (7, 3): body [(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5)] \u2014 next turn from (7, 3): UP (7, 4) body \u2014 unsafe; DOWN (7, 2) free; LEFT (6, 3) free; RIGHT (8, 3) free. 3 safe moves.  \n\nDOWN gives better mobility next turn, but RIGHT gets apple.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nGoing DOWN to (7, 3) risks enemy moving DOWN to (6, 3) \u2014 adjacent horizontally \u2014 possible head-on next turn if we both move toward each other.  \n\nGoing RIGHT to (8, 4) gets apple safely, even though mobility next turn is limited (2 moves), I can reassess then. Enemy unlikely to threaten (8, 4) immediately.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nApple at (8, 4) is safe to take \u2014 no enemy threat this turn. Taking it increases lead (3 vs 2 apples).  \n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (8, 4), from (8, 4) only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. Prefer DOWN toward apple (8, 2) if enemy not blocking.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait, enemy head is at (7, 3) currently, but after simultaneous move, if enemy moves away, it might be safe? Actually, no: enemy head is currently at (7, 3), so moving LEFT into (7, 3) means my head moves into enemy head\u2019s current position \u2014 but enemy will also move this turn, so I must check: if enemy stays there, we collide head-on; if enemy moves away, it becomes empty. But rules: simultaneous movement means we resolve collisions after movement. If enemy moves away from (7, 3), then (7, 3) becomes empty after they leave, so I can move into it safely. But if enemy stays at (7, 3) (moves UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT into same cell?), Actually, if enemy moves LEFT to (6, 3), then (7, 3) becomes their body segment from last position \u2014 so moving LEFT into (7, 3) would hit their body and I die. So LEFT is unsafe because (7, 3) is currently enemy head, and after their move, it will either be empty if they move away, or their body if they move away (yes), or still head if they stay (head-on collision). But I cannot know their move \u2014 but rules: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" After movement, if enemy moves away from (7, 3), that cell becomes their body segment (since their head was there, now body extends). So moving into (7, 3) will always result in hitting enemy body (unless they move backwards into their own body? No, they can\u2019t move backwards because it\u2019s suicide). So LEFT is unsafe.  \n\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 3) \u2014 apple \u2014 safe (on board, not into body).  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy proximity:**  \nEnemy head at (7, 3). Their safe moves:  \nFrom (7, 3): UP (7, 4) \u2014 my body segment? (7, 4) is my body \u2014 unsafe for them.  \nDOWN (7, 2) \u2014 free.  \nLEFT (6, 3) \u2014 their body segment? (6, 3) is their body \u2014 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (8, 3) \u2014 my head\u2019s current position \u2014 unsafe for them (into my body).  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is DOWN to (7, 2).  \n\nThat means enemy will likely move DOWN.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple opportunity:**  \nRIGHT (9, 3) has apple \u2014 immediate eat \u2192 grow to length 5.  \nDOWN (8, 2) \u2014 empty now, but apple at (8, 2) is still there \u2014 wait, apple at (8, 2) is still on board. So DOWN also leads toward apple at (8, 2) next turn.  \n\nBut RIGHT gets apple immediately.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after move:**  \nIf RIGHT to (9, 3) (eat apple): new body length 5: head (9, 3), body [(8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)]. Next turn from (9, 3): UP (9, 4) free; DOWN (9, 2) free; LEFT (8, 3) body \u2014 unsafe; RIGHT off board \u2014 unsafe \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nIf DOWN to (8, 2): head (8, 2), body [(8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)]. Next turn from (8, 2): UP (8, 3) body \u2014 unsafe; DOWN (8, 1) free; LEFT (7, 2) free (enemy at (7, 2) after their move? Yes, enemy moving DOWN to (7, 2) \u2014 so LEFT into (7, 2) would be adjacent to enemy head \u2014 but not this turn, next turn: careful: after this turn, enemy head at (7, 2), my head at (8, 2) \u2014 so next turn moving LEFT to (7, 2) would be head-on collision risk if enemy stays or moves right. But that\u2019s next turn\u2019s problem. For mobility count: LEFT (7, 2) is free now but will have enemy head next turn \u2014 so not safe next turn? Actually mobility is about free cells, not future enemy moves. But enemy head is a body to me next turn? Wait, next turn enemy head at (7, 2) is a snake head, not body. If I move into it, head-on collision. So it\u2019s unsafe. So from (8, 2) next turn: UP unsafe (body), DOWN (8, 1) safe, LEFT (7, 2) unsafe (enemy head), RIGHT (9, 2) safe (apple) \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nBoth have 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy is moving DOWN to (7, 2), away from me. No immediate collision risk this turn.  \nRIGHT gets apple and growth now, improving score lead (4 vs 2).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nTaking apple now is better for score. RIGHT is safe and beneficial.  \n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 3), likely move DOWN to (9, 2) apple if enemy not blocking. Avoid moving LEFT into possible enemy approach.  \n\nRIGHT",

Their safe moves from (7, 2):  \nUP (7, 3) \u2014 their body segment \u2014 unsafe.  \nDOWN (7, 1) \u2014 empty \u2014 safe.  \nLEFT (6, 2) \u2014 empty \u2014 safe.  \nRIGHT (8, 2) \u2014 empty \u2014 safe.  \n\nSo enemy has 3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple opportunity:**  \nDOWN (9, 2) has apple \u2014 immediate eat \u2192 grow to length 6.  \nUP (9, 4) \u2014 empty now, but no apple there.  \n\nDOWN gets apple immediately.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after move:**  \nIf DOWN to (9, 2) (eat apple): new body length 6: head (9, 2), body [(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)]. Next turn from (9, 2): UP (9, 3) body \u2014 unsafe; DOWN (9, 1) free; LEFT (8, 2) free; RIGHT off board \u2014 unsafe \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nIf UP to (9, 4): head (9, 4), body [(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)]. Next turn from (9, 4): UP (9, 5) free; DOWN (9, 3) body \u2014 unsafe; LEFT (8, 4) body \u2014 unsafe; RIGHT off board \u2014 unsafe \u2192 1 safe move.  \n\nDOWN gives better mobility next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy is at (7, 2) and could move RIGHT to (8, 2) \u2014 adjacent to my DOWN target (9, 2). But since moves are simultaneous, even if enemy goes to (8, 2), I still land on (9, 2) and eat apple safely \u2014 no collision because they are not in my target cell. Next turn, if enemy is at (8, 2), my LEFT move from (9, 2) would be risky (head-on possibility), but I\u2019ll have DOWN and LEFT safe (LEFT into (8, 2) would kill me if enemy stays, but I can choose DOWN instead).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN gets apple, improves score lead (5 vs 2), and gives better mobility than UP.  \n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 2), likely move DOWN to (9, 1) to avoid possible enemy at (8, 2) and keep options open.  \n\nDOWN",
