Apples are distributed at (8, 4), (4, 2), (6, 8), (5, 9), (3, 4). The current turn is 0/150.\n\nI need to choose a move from UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. I should prioritize moves that increase the chances of collecting apples while avoiding danger. Considering the enemy's position at (0, 0), any move that brings me closer to the apples is advantageous. I need to keep in mind the enemy might also move, potentially creating a collision if I choose a move that leads me into their path.\n\nMy current position is (0, 1). The closest apple to me is at (4, 2). Moving towards this apple looks like a good move. Let's check if any moves would lead to immediate death. Moving RIGHT would get me to (1, 1), staying within the board. Moving UP would get me to (0, 0), which would be immediately out of bounds. Moving LEFT would get me to (-1, 1), which is out of bounds. Moving DOWN would get me to (1, 0), which is out of bounds. So, RIGHT seems to be a safe move.\n\nHowever, if snake #0 goes up, it will immediately reach (0, 1) and we\u2019ll have a collision. We need to anticipate the enemy's possible move. Let\u2019s assess if a forward-and-backward approach is helpful. The apple (8, 4) is a long ways away.\n\nLet's analyze possible next moves:\n* **RIGHT:** Moves me to (1, 1). I'm closer to (4,2), but also at risk of a head-on collision with snake #0 if they move up.\n* **UP:** Moves me to (0, 0), which is out of bounds. I will die.\n* **LEFT:** Moves me to (-1, 1), which is out of bounds. I will die.\n* **DOWN:** Moves me to (1, 0), which is out of bounds. I will die.\n\nSince RIGHT is a viable option, and it doesn't immediately kill me, and keeping me closer to a possible apple, I choose RIGHT.\n\nMy long-term plan is to try to continue moving towards the apples, while being aware of the possibility of collisions. I want to reduce the risk of hitting snake #0. I could try a slight adjustment, but the current position of snake #0 makes that risky. I will aim for a slightly more direct approach to the closest apple.\n\n\n\nRIGHT.",

RIGHT moves to (1,0), which is empty and keeps a wide, safe corridor open while you head toward apples located at (4,2) and (3,4). Overall, RIGHT is the safest immediate choice that also improves your position for reaching nearby apples without getting trapped.\n\nShort-term plan: Move toward the nearest apples while maintaining at least two safe follow-up options each turn; avoid moving into tight corners or directly adjacent to the opponent if it limits your escape routes.\n\nRIGHT",
