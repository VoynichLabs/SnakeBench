We are somewhat far from these, but moving toward the right increases our x-coordinate:\n  - Moving right from x=2 toward x=5 or 6 could position us closer to apples at (5,1), (6,6), (5,7).\n  - Apples at (8,1) and (8,5) are farther right.\n- Enemy at (4,2) is quite far from current path if we go right, so no immediate threat.\n- Walls are at x=0 or x=9. Moving right from x=2, we are safe for now.\n- Moving up would take us to (2,5), which is not directly close to any apple, but may set up for climbing toward higher apples.\n- Moving down to (2,3) seems less strategic; left to (1,4) could be dangerous if approaching wall or obstacle.\n- Moving left to (1,4) might bring us closer to the wall at x=0, which we should avoid, unless we need to get away from danger.\n\nLooking at potential strategies:\n\n- Moving RIGHT continues to push us toward the right side, potentially reaching apples at (5,7) or (8,1)/(8,5). Since there's no immediate obstacle in that path, it's reasonable.\n- Moving UP could help go toward apples at higher y-values, especially (5,7) and (8,5). But we're farther from those at the moment.\n- Moving left risks hitting the wall soon, and moving down seems less promising.\n\nGiven the current position at (2,4), moving RIGHT seems to be a good plan to advance toward the concentration of apples to the right. Also, staying on a safe path, avoiding walls and enemies.\n\nNext move: RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving RIGHT to approach remaining apples on the right side, ensuring safe navigation and considering the possibility of collecting apples at (5,7), (6,6), or (8,5) in subsequent moves.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

Since the last move was UP, we moved from (8,5) to (8,6), meaning our current head position should now be at (8,6). But the last move information indicates our last move was UP, and the snake is at (8,6). \n\nAssuming the snake just moved UP into (8,6), the previous position was (8,5). The apples nearby are at (8,5) and (8,7). From the current position at (8,6):\n\n- Moving UP to (8,7):\n  - There is an apple at (8,7), but checking the given board:\n\n  - The apple at (8,7): Let's confirm.\n\nThe apples are at:\n- (6,6)\n- (5,7)\n- (0,7)\n- (7,6)\n- (7,3)\n\nFrom the board:\n\nRow 7 (top row, y=7):  \n- At (6,7): ?\n\n- At (5,7): Apple  \n- At (7,7): ?\n\nGiven the grid, apples at (5,7), (6,6), (7,6). Wait, the initial apple coordinates differ from the grid.\n\nReassessing apple positions:\n\n- Apples at: (6,6), (5,7), (0,7), (7,6), (7,3)\n\nOn the grid:\n\n- (6,6): row 6, col 6 -> matches apple at (6,6)\n- (5,7): row 7, col 5 -> matches apple at (5,7)\n- (0,7): row 7, col 0 -> apple at (0,7)\n- (7,6): row 6, col 7 -> apple at (7,6)\n- (7,3): row 3, col 7 -> apple at (7,3)\n\nThus, our stack contains these apples.\n\nCurrent position: (8,6) (assuming one step before the move), moving UP to (8,7). Is there an apple at (8,7)? No, apples at (6,6), (5,7), (0,7), (7,6), (7,3). The closest apple above is at (5,7) which is to the northwest, not directly above.\n\nMoving UP from (8,6) to (8,7):\n\n- (8,7): No apple there.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (8,5) to (8,6) would have been good, but based on the last move info, the move was UP.\n\nNow, the best move would be to go toward the nearest apple:\n\n- The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7). From current position (8,6), you need to reach (5,7):\n\nPossible paths:\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,6): where there's an apple, but moving into (7,6) from (8,6) will be LEFT.\n\n- Moving LEFT:\n\n  - From (8,6) to (7,6): valid, and the snake would eat the apple and grow.\n\n- Next, from (7,6) to (5,7)? To reach the apple at (5,7):\n\n  - From (7,6) to (6,7): then to (5,7).\n\nSo, possible plan:\n\n1. Move LEFT from (8,6) to (7,6): eat apple at (7,6), grow.\n\n2. Next, move LEFT again to (6,6): which also has an apple, further growth.\n\n3. From (6,6) towards (5,7), move diagonally, but since only orthogonal moves are allowed:\n\n  - From (6,6), move UP to (6,7): no apple at (6,7).\n\n  - Then LEFT to (5,6): no apple.\n\n  - Then UP to (5,7): apple.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on immediate opportunities:\n\n- The safest, most direct move now would be LEFT to (7,6) to get the apple.\n\nCheck for dangers:\n\n- Is moving LEFT into (7,6) safe?\n\n- On the grid:\n\n  - Our snake is at (8,6), with the body at [(8,5)].\n\n  - Moving LEFT into (7,6): check for enemy or other snakes.\n\n- Enemy snake at (9,2) \u2013 not near.\n\n- The enemy's body is at (9,3) and (8,3). No risk of collision moving into (7,6).\n\n- No walls blocking.\n\nSince the plan to move left is safe, and it gets us closer to an apple, I will proceed with **LEFT**.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**\n\nMy strategic goal next turn:\n\n- After eating at (7,6), plan to move towards the apple at (6,6) or (5,7).\n\n- Keep avoiding enemy snake and walls.\n\nFinally, I will execute **LEFT** to reach the apple at (7,6)."
