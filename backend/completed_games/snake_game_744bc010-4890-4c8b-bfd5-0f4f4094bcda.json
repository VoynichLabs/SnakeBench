That could kill both of us and waste a turn.\n- UP or LEFT would not immediately set me on a direct path to the nearest easy apple and may reduce future mobility.\n\nPlan:\n- Turn 0: move RIGHT to (7,6).\n- Turn 1: move RIGHT to (8,6) and eat the apple if still available.\n\nRIGHT",

If no safe move remains, choose a low-risk continuation that preserves options for the next turn and waits for the opponent to create an opening.\n\nGiven the lack of a safe move, I will select DOWN to proceed and hope the game state updates to provide a safe path next turn. \n\nDOWN",
