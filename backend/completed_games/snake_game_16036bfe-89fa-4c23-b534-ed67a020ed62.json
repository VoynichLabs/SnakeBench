My length is now 2, body is (7, 0).\nSnake 0 also moved this turn. Based on the provided board state, Snake 0 must have moved from (7, 7) to (7, 8) because position (7, 8) is now '0' and (7, 7) is empty. This move was SAFE for Snake 0 (it moved towards A(8, 8) and A(5, 9)).\n\nCurrent State Analysis (Turn 1 -> Start of Turn 2):\nMy Head: (7, 1). Body: [(7, 0)]. Length 2.\nSnake 0 Head: (7, 8). Body: none. Length 1.\n\nApples: A1(5, 3), A2(8, 8), A3(4, 8), A4(4, 3), A5(5, 9).\n\nSafety Check:\n1. Board edges: Safe.\n2. Self collision: My tail is at (7, 0). Moving backwards (DOWN) to (7, 0) is deadly.\n3. Enemy collision: Snake 0 is at (7, 8).\n   - If I move UP to (7, 2): Safe from Snake 0 head.\n   - If I move DOWN to (7, 0): I hit my own tail. Deadly.\n   - If I move LEFT to (6, 1): Safe from Snake 0 head.\n   - If I move RIGHT to (8, 1): Safe from Snake 0 head.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (7, 2), LEFT (6, 1), RIGHT (8, 1).\n\nApple Proximity:\nThe closest apples are (5, 3) and (4, 3) (y=3 level).\nThe current snake is at x=7, y=1. Moving up is good progress towards y=3.\n\nComparison of Safe Moves:\n1. **UP to (7, 2)**: Continues vertical progress towards y=3 apples. If Snake 0 moves down (e.g., to (7, 7)), we are moving towards each other, but still far apart (5 squares distance).\n2. **LEFT to (6, 1)**: Brings me closer to x=4/x=5 apple coordinates.\n3. **RIGHT to (8, 1)**: Moves me slightly away from the relevant cluster of apples (x=4, 5 centered).\n\nSince the earliest apples are at y=3, continuing vertical movement seems slightly higher priority unless an edge or opponent forces a change. Moving UP puts me at (7, 2). Next turn I can aim for (7, 3) or pivot left/right.\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 2):\nIf Snake 0 moves down towards me (e.g., to (7, 6)), we close the gap slowly, but it's low priority as they are far away and I have no body yet to threaten them with.\n\nChoosing UP to maintain positive trajectory towards the y=3 apples seems the most straightforward path given the current separation.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving generally towards the cluster of apples around y=3 ((5, 3), (4, 3)). Since I am at x=7, moving towards x=5/4 is necessary. UP is the best first step to increase y coordinate efficiently. I should look to pivot left around y=3 or y=4.\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nUP\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy snake ID 1 moved UP from (7, 1) to (7, 2). My body is now [(7, 1), (7, 0)]. Length 3.\nSnake 0 moved from (7, 8) to some position. Given the board state, Snake 0 must have moved DOWN to (7, 7) (since (7, 8) is now empty and (7, 7) is empty, but (7, 8) is an apple A at the start of turn 1, wait, A2 is at (8, 8), A3 is at (4, 8). Snake 0 is at (7, 8). It seems Snake 0 moved DOWN to (7, 7) OR LEFT/RIGHT/UP.\n\nLet's re-examine the board state provided for Turn 1 turn start:\nSnake 1 Head: (7, 1). Body: none (Wait, the board state provided reflects the *results* of my UP move from turn 0, meaning my snake is at (7, 1) and its previous segment is implied to be at (7, 0) if it just moved up. The provided state shows snake 1 at (7, 1) and nothing else on column 7 line 0/1. This confirms my *previous rationale* used the state from the *end* of Turn 0 planning, and the resulting move UP placed me at (7, 1), and my body at (7, 0) *unless* the input data reflects the state *before* my intended move UP in the previous turn, which it seems to, based on the prompt structure (\"Your move: UP\" followed by the state *after* that move was executed).\n\nRereading the Turn 1 setup:\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (7, 1), Body: none. Apples collected: 0.\nThis implies my snake is *currently* at (7, 1) and is only 1 segment long (Head = (7, 1), Body = none). This contradicts the \"Your last move information\" which stated I chose UP from (7, 0).\n\nASSUMPTION RECALIBRATION: The initial board state provided for the START of Turn 1 reflects the state *after* the determined move from Turn 1 began, but *before* my decision for Turn 2.\n\nIf Turn 1 (my previous move) resulted in UP (from 7, 0 to 7, 1):\nThe board state *should* show Snake 1 at (7, 1) with a body at (7, 0).\nThe provided state for Turn 1 shows: Snake 1 Head (7, 1), Body: none. This means the board state is from the *start* of Turn 1, and my last move was only advisory information about what I *said* I intended to do.\n\nGiven:\nLast move information: **UP** (Implies my snake was at (7, 0) and moved to (7, 1)).\nCurrent State (Turn 1 Start): Head (7, 1), Body: none.\n\nThis discrepancy is common in these simulation setups. I will proceed based on the *Current State* provided for evaluation, but I must account for the enemy move.\n\nIf my snake is at (7, 1), length 1 (Body: none).\nAnd Snake 0 is at (7, 8), length 1 (Body: none).\n\nIf my last move *was* UP, my actual position *should* be what the state shows for T=1: (7, 1) and size 1. This means the move was executed, but perhaps length tracking is reset or the board state overrides the description of my body if I didn't eat an apple. Since score is 0, I haven't eaten an apple. A length 1 snake that moves UP should acquire a body segment at the old head location (7, 0) unless the move was invalid or the game rules imply a length 1 snake simply moves its head without leaving a tail segment until it eats. Standard Snake rules dictate a tail segment is left immediately unless an apple is eaten. I will assume standard rules: I moved (7, 0) -> (7, 1), so my body is (7, 0). If the *provided* board state conflicts (body none), I trust the provided board state for safety checks, but I must assume the opponent ALSO moved based on the result of Turn 1.\n\nSnake 0 (Head 7, 8) must have moved. If it moved DOWN to (7, 7), it is now there.\n\nInterpreting the Board State (Turn 1):\n1: (7, 1) [HEAD]\n0: (7, 8) [HEAD]\nIf my previous move was UP: My old head (7, 0) is gone, my new head is (7, 1). If I didn't eat, my body should be (7, 0).\nThe board state marker '1' is at (7, 1). This suggests my snake is length 1 OR that the body segment at (7, 0) is not displayed because it's outside the visible region (y > 0), but y=0 is visible. The board shows row 0 empty except corners. (7, 0) should be marked if it exists. Since it is NOT marked, I MUST assume my snake has length 1, Head (7, 1).\n\nThis means the move UP from (7, 0) resulted in position (7, 1) and length 1, implying the tail segment at (7, 0) was retracted (standard rule when not eating).\n\nSnake 0 at (7, 8). Since the board marker '0' is at (7, 8), Snake 0 also stayed length 1 OR moved and left no tail.\n\nIf both snakes are length 1, they ONLY die if they collide head-to-head or hit the wall. They cannot hit their body.\n\nPossible Moves for Snake 1 (Head at 7, 1):\n1. UP to (7, 2). Safe.\n2. DOWN to (7, 0). Safe (no body to hit yet).\n3. LEFT to (6, 1). Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (8, 1). Safe.\n\nEnemy Snake 0 is at (7, 8).\n\nEnemy Next Move Prediction: Snake 0 is likely aiming for A3(4, 8) or A2(8, 8) or A5(5, 9).\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (7, 9): Safe.\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (7, 7): Safe.\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (6, 8): Closer to A3(4, 8).\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (8, 8): Hits A2! Snake 0 eats and grows to length 2. (Head 8, 8, Body 7, 8).\n\nWe must choose our move before knowing the enemy's move, assuming they are rational. Snake 0 is likely to eat A2(8, 8) by moving RIGHT.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT -> S0 Head (8, 8), Body (7, 8).\n\nMy options based on S0 moving RIGHT:\n1. UP to (7, 2). Safe from S0(8, 8).\n2. DOWN to (7, 0). Safe from S0(8, 8).\n3. LEFT to (6, 1). Safe from S0(8, 8).\n4. RIGHT to (8, 1). Safe from S0(8, 8).\n\nAll deterministic safe moves still apply. We are still aiming for the y=3 apples. (7, 1) to (7, 2) (UP) is good vertical progress.\n\nWhat if S0 moves LEFT to (6, 8) aiming for (4, 8)?\nMy options based on S0 moving LEFT (6, 8):\n1. UP to (7, 2). Safe.\n2. DOWN to (7, 0). Safe.\n3. LEFT to (6, 1). Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (8, 1). Safe.\n\nSince the proximity of the enemy doesn't strongly constrain the next move, prioritize apple seeking. The closest targets are (5, 3) and (4, 3). I am at (7, 1).\n\nGoal: Decrease Y to 3, then Decrease X to 4 or 5.\nMoving UP gets me to (7, 2). This reduces the path length to y=3 by 1 step compared to moving DOWN or sideways.\n\nMove UP is the best continuation of the previous successful strategy.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving towards the lower apples at y=3. Prioritize vertical movement until y=3 is reached, then pivot horizontally towards x=4/5. Monitor Snake 0's path to ensure no head-on closure or dangerous growth occurs, though Snake 0 seems focused on the top right apples.\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy snake ID 1 moved UP from (7, 1) to (7, 2).

Move UP selected.\nT=1 End State (Current Input Board): S1 at (7, 2), S0 at (7, 8).\nIf S0 at (7, 8) *did not move* this turn, my UP move was safe.\nIf S0 *did* move, the board state reflects the result:\nIf S0 moved UP -> (7, 9). Board shows 0 at (7, 8). So S0 did not move UP.\nIf S0 moved DOWN -> (7, 7). Board shows 0 at (7, 8). So S0 did not move DOWN.\nIf S0 moved LEFT -> (6, 8). Board shows 0 at (7, 8). So S0 did not move LEFT.\nIf S0 moved RIGHT -> (8, 8). Board shows 0 at (7, 8) and A at (8, 8). If S0 ate A(8, 8), S0 Head is (8, 8) and Body is (7, 8). The board shows '0' at (7, 8). This implies S0 moved RIGHT and A(8, 8) was eaten, and S0's body resides at (7, 8). Snake 0 is now length 2.\n\nLet's assume Snake 0 ate A(8, 8) by moving RIGHT.\nS1 Head: (7, 2). Body: none (Length 1).\nS0 Head: (8, 8). Body: (7, 8).

Wait, the key shows A(8, 8) is still present, marked 'A' in the map legend, but the map shows '0' at (7, 8) and 'A' at (8, 8).\n\nRereading the board map provided:\n 8 . . . .

S0 has a small body segment at (5, 8).\n\n**My Primary Goal:** Eat apple (5, 3). This apple is 1 step away (LEFT).\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (6, 3):**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (5, 3):**\n    *   **Action:** If no collision, S1 eats Apple A1 (5, 3). S1 grows to length 2, Score +1.\n    *   **Safety Check:**\n        *   Board: Safe (5, 3 is inside 0-9).\n        *   Self Collision: Safe (Body is empty, 5, 3 is not 6, 2).\n        *   Enemy Collision Check (S0 moves from (5, 9) to $H'$):\n            *   If S0 moves UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, its target $H'$ will be (5, 10)X, (5, 8), (4, 9), or (6, 9).\n            *   None of these candidate $H'$ positions collide with (5, 3).

Safe.\n\n**Decision:** Moving LEFT to (5, 3) eats an apple, increases score, and grows the snake, which is the highest priority currently, especially since it's immediately reachable and safe.\n\n**Next Turn Projection (If LEFT is chosen):**\nS1 Head: (5, 3), Body: (6, 3). Length 2, Score 1.\nS0 Head position $H'$ depends on its move. I need to monitor S0's growth and direction. If S0 attempts to move towards the apples on the left side of the board (4, 8 or 4, 3), I might need to adjust.\n\nPlan: Eat the closest apple immediately.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT\n\n---\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 5):**\nS1 Head: (5, 3), Body: [(6, 3)]. Length 2. Score 1. (Outcome of previous LEFT move).\nS0 Head: ??? (S0 moved simultaneously on Turn 4).\n\nWe must reconstruct S0's likely move on Turn 4 to determine the current board state. Since **no specific move by S0 was given/recorded for Turn 4**, the provided board state already reflects the positions *after* Turn 4 moves have occurred.\n\n**Board State Check based on current provided info post-Turn 4:**\nS1 Head: (5, 3), Body: [(6, 3)]. (Confirmed by my move LEFT).\nS0 Head: (5, 8), Body: [(5, 9)]. (This must be S0's position after their Turn 4 move).\n\nIf S0 was at (5, 9) on Turn 4, and moved to (5, 8), this means S0 moved DOWN.\nS0's body segment was at (5, 8). If S0 moved DOWN to (5, 8), this would be a collision with its own body unless it didn't grow on the previous turn, or the board representation is slightly misleading about segment growth/shrinkage on simultaneous movement.\n\n*Reconciling S0's geometry based on the board:*\nS0 Head: (5, 8). Body: [(5, 9)]. Length 2.\nThis configuration means S0 moved from some position $P_{old}$ to (5, 8).\nIf S0 did *not* eat, its tail segment would have been (5, 9) at $T=4$. Its previous head position must have been (5, 9) or (5, 7) or (4, 8) or (6, 8).\nIf S0 was at (5, 9) T3, and ate an apple, its tail would be (6, 9) or similar, or it would move from (5, 9) to $H'$, leaving (5, 9) as the tail.\nThe current state shows S0 head at (5, 8), and its segment is one cell away at (5, 9). This implies S0 *moved away* from (5, 9), and (5, 9) became its tail segment, or S0 moved *towards* (5, 9) (impossible as (5, 9) is S0's tail).\n\nLet's assume the provided positions are absolutely correct for the start of Turn 5:\nS1: Head (5, 3), Body [(6, 3)].\nS0: Head (5, 8), Body [(5, 9)]. (S0 appears to have shrunk due to not eating, or moved such that its tail segment is (5, 9)).\n\n**Apples remaining:** (8, 8), (4, 8), (4, 3), (5, 4), (3, 0). (S1 ate (5, 3)).\n\n**S1 Current Position (5, 3).**\n**S0 Current Position (5, 8).**\n\n**S1 Goals for Turn 5:**\n1. Stay safe.\n2. Target potential apples: (5, 4) is closest (1 step UP). (4, 3) is 2 steps away (LEFT, DOWN). (4, 8), (8, 8) are far. (3, 0) is very far.\n\n**Safety Check from (5, 3):**\nS1 Body is at (6, 3). Backwards move: (5, 2). Safe.\n\n**Potential Moves & Targets:**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 4):**\n    *   **Action:** Eats Apple A5 (5, 4). S1 grows to length 3. Score +1 (Total 2).\n    *   **Safety:**\n        *   Off board: Safe.\n        *   Self Collision: Safe. (5, 4 is not 6, 3).\n        *   S0 Head Collision: S0 moves from (5, 8). S0 is likely heading towards the top apples (4, 8), (8, 8) or perhaps moving orthogonally/randomly. If S0 moves UP: (5, 9) (off board, or body). If S0 moves DOWN: (5, 7). If S0 moves LEFT/RIGHT: (4, 8) or (6, 8). None of these immediately seem to collide with (5, 4). (5, 9) is currently S0's tail segment, so moving UP is safe from collision with S0's head, even if S0 were stationary.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 3):**\n    *   **Action:** Moves 2 steps from the apple. Safe, but slower than UP.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (5, 2):**\n    *   **Action:** Safe move, but delays eating.\n\n**S0 Threat Assessment:**\nS0 is at (5, 8). It is currently between the top two apples (4, 8) and (8, 8). It is currently far from me (5, 3). Proximity is not an immediate concern. Safety is paramount, but maximizing apple capture is the priority.\n\n**Decision:** Moving UP to (5, 4) instantly captures the next closest apple and continues growth towards the center/top. This seems like the safest maximizing move.\n\n**Long Term Plan (S1 Safety Note):** Continue prioritizing immediate, safe apple grabs. Maintain distance from S0 until S0 starts showing aggressive directional bias towards the lower half of the board or I reach sufficient size (e.g., length 5-6).\n\nMove: UP\n\n**Next Turn Projection (If UP is chosen):**\nS1 Head: (5, 4), Body: [(5, 3), (6, 3)]. Length 3, Score 2.\nS0 Head $H'$ from (5, 8). We will evaluate its next move next turn.\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

Positions S1 for potential move towards (4, 8) or (8, 8) later, or move towards (4, 3) via (5, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3).\n    *   S0 threat: S0 at (5, 7). If S0 moves DOWN to (5, 6), or UP to (5, 8) [S0 body], or LEFT/RIGHT to (4, 7)/(6, 7). Moving to (5, 5) seems safe from S0's current location.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 4):** Moves towards (4, 3). Good option.\n    *   If S0 moves towards (4, 3) as well, we might race it.\n    *   S0 is unlikely to head towards (4, 3) immediately, as it's far from (5, 7).\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Safe space. Moves away from S0.\n\n**Evaluating S0's threat:** S0 has Head at (5, 7) and Body/Tail at (5, 8). S0 appears to have moved away from the top apples and down towards the center line, perhaps seeking to block or intercept a lower apple/snake path.\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (5, 5):\nS1 Head: (5, 5). Body: (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3). Length 4.\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (4, 4):\nS1 Head: (4, 4). Body: (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3). Length 4.\n\nSince (4, 3) is the most accessible physical apple other than the ones already eaten, moving towards it via (4, 4) seems slightly preferable to moving away via (5, 5), assuming it is safe.\n\n**Safety Check for LEFT to (4, 4):**\n*   Self collision: Safe. (4, 4) is not (5, 3) or (6, 3).\n*   S0 collision: S0 head at (5, 7). Possible S0 moves: (5, 6), (5, 8) [S0 body, deadly for S0], (4, 7), (6, 7). (4, 4) is safe from all these head positions.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue approaching apple (4, 3) while monitoring S0's tendency to pursue the middle vertical line. If S0 continues moving vertically, S1 can safely claim (4, 3) next turn.\n\nI will choose LEFT to position for the apple at (4, 3).\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nContinue aggressive apple pursuit. The next target is (4, 3). Move LEFT to (4, 4) sets up a direct grab next turn. Closest safety spot is UP (5, 5).

S0 moves simultaneously.\n\n**S0 Move Prediction for Turn 7:**\nS0 Head is at (5, 7). Valid moves for S0 (avoiding (5, 8) and edges): (5, 6), (4, 7), (6, 7).\nS0's closest apple is (4, 8) [2 moves away via (5, 7) -> (5, 8) (if it were safe, but (5, 8) is S0 tail) or via (4, 7) -> (4, 8), or via (6, 7) -> ...]. Closest apple is likely (4, 8) or (8, 8). Given its location at (5, 7), moving UP seems logical: either to (5, 8) (if S0's tail moved) or (5, 6) (South). If S0 is aiming for (4, 8), it might go LEFT to (4, 7).\n\n**Current State (Turn 7 Start):**\nS1 Head: (4, 4). Body: [(5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3)].\nS0 Head: (5, 7). Body: [(5, 8)] (This assumes S0 did not eat an apple or die last turn, and its tail segment (5, 8) remained despite the head moving to (5, 7)). *Correction based on provided state*: S0 Head: (6, 7), Body: [(5, 7)]. This implies S0 moved RIGHT from (5, 7) or UP from (6, 6) or some move that resulted in this state. Since this is the given board state input for T7, I must use $H_0=(6, 7)$ and $B_0=[(5, 7)]$.\n\n**S1 Goal:** Eat apple at (4, 3). Distance is 1 move (DOWN).\n\n**Safety Check from (4, 4):**\n1. **DOWN to (4, 3) [EAT APPLE]:**\n    *   Self collision: (4, 3) is not S1 body segment ((5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3)). Safe from self.\n    *   S0 collision: S0 Head at (6, 7). Possible S0 moves: (6, 6) [DOWN], (6, 8) [UP], (5, 7) [LEFT, which is S0 body, so S0 cannot move there], (7, 7) [RIGHT].\n    *   If S0 moves DOWN to (6, 6), S1 moving to (4, 3) is safe (no intersection).\n    *   If S0 moves UP to (6, 8), S1 moving to (4, 3) is safe.\n    *   If S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 7), S1 moving to (4, 3) is safe.\n    *   No immediate collision or body hazard predicted at (4, 3) based on S0's remote position.\n\n2. **UP to (4, 5):** Safe, but moves away from the immediate goal (4, 3).\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 4):** Safe, moves towards (3, 0) eventually, but leaves (4, 3) open for S0 if S0 decides to pivot radically.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 4):** Collision! (5, 4) is S1's immediate body segment (tail of the head movement). **INVALID MOVE.** (S1 moved RIGHT to (5, 4) last turn, so that spot is now occupied by its body). *Wait, checking the body list:* Head (4, 4). Body: [(5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3)]. Moving RIGHT means moving to (5, 4), which is occupied by the segment immediately behind the head. **Must avoid RIGHT.**\n\n**Confirmed Safe Moves:** UP (4, 5), DOWN (4, 3). (LEFT (3, 4) is also likely safe, but moves away from the apple).\n\n**Conclusion:** Since (4, 3) is an apple and it is safe to move there, this is the optimal move.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** After eating (4, 3), my snake will have length 5 and 3 apples. The next closest apple is (1, 1) or the top apples (4, 8), (8, 8). I will continue to position myself to clear the remaining lower apples first, aiming for (3, 0) next if S0 doesn't contest it aggressively. If S0 seems to move towards the lower quadrant, I might need to pivot. For now, secure (4, 3).\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

Length: 4 (Apples eaten = Length - 2, so 4-2=2, wait, my apple count is 3, the length must be 5 if starting length was 2. Let's re-verify the provided state vs last move rationale).\n\nPrevious Turn (Turn 7 END): S1 Head (4, 4). Body: [(5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3)]. Apples: 2. Length seems 4 (Head + 3 body segments). If starting length was 2, eating 2 apples makes length 4. This matches: 3 body segments + Head = 4 total length.\n\nLast Move Rationale stated I moved DOWN to (4, 3) and the board state reflects this: S1 Head (4, 3). If I ate an apple at (4, 3), my apple count should be 3, and my length should increase by 1.\nCurrent Apple Count: 3.\nCurrent Body: [(4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]. The body segments must now be 4 segments long if I ate the apple at (4, 3).\nIf the board state provided is *after* the move was executed and the apple was consumed:\nHead: (4, 3).\nNew Body should be: (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3) (The tail segment (6, 3) from T7 turn should still be there, and the body should have grown).\n\nLet's reconcile the board state with the move:\nT7 End: Head (4, 4), Body [(5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3)]. Apples 2. Length 4.\nMy move was DOWN to (4, 3). This was an Apple location in T7 input, so I ate it.\nNew state (T8 Start): Head (4, 3). Apples 3. Length 5.\nBody should be: (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3) (The old body segments, with the first body segment being the old head position).\nThe board state shows:\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (4, 3)\n  - Body: [(4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]\n  - Apples collected: 3\nThis implies a length of 4 (Head + 3 body segments). If I ate an apple, my length should be 5 (Head + 4 body segments). The list seems incomplete for a length 5 snake, as the tail from T7 ((6, 3)) is missing from the body list provided in the board state description, or the body list represents only the segments *after* the tail has moved.\n\nAssuming the provided configuration (H: (4, 3), B: [(4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]) accurately reflects the current topology, the snake has 4 parts total. If Apples=3, length should be 5. There is a slight inconsistency, but I must proceed based on the structured data provided for T8. I will assume the provided body list is H+(L-1) segments, and trust the Apple count (3). If L=4, Apples should be 2. Since Apples=3, I assume L=5, and the body list is missing the tail segment that corresponds to the T7 tail (6, 3). *I will assume the body segments listed are simply the segments immediately following the head, and the true tail position is implied by the movement sequence.*\n\nIf length is 5 (3 apples), the body should have 4 segments:\nH_T7 L (4, 4). B_T7 L [(5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3)].\nMove DOWN to (4, 3) eating apple. New Head (4, 3). New Body: (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3).\nIf this is the case, the provided body list `[(4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]` is missing the $(6, 3)$ tail segment. I must navigate using the known physical positions and assume the body parts available for collision are (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), and the missing one (6, 3).\n\nS1 Head: (4, 3)\nS1 Body Segments (Collision Zone): (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), and likely (6, 3).\n\nEnemy Snake S0: Head (7, 7), Body [(6, 7)]. Apples 1. Length 2.\n\nApples Remaining: (8, 8), (4, 8), (3, 0), (1, 1).\nMy Goal: Eat (1, 1) or (3, 0) since they are closer than the high Y apples. (1, 1) is closest in Manhattan distance (4 moves).\n\n**Potential Moves from (4, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):** Collision! (4, 4) is the segment immediately behind the head. **DEADLY.**\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 2):** Safe from self. Moves away from nearby apples if S0 doesn't contest the bottom. S0 at (7, 7) is unlikely to reach (4, 2) soon.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):** Safe from self. Moves toward (3, 0) and (1, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Collision! (5, 3) is a body segment. **DEADLY.**\n\n**Safe Moves:** DOWN (4, 2), LEFT (3, 3).\n\n**Predicting S0's Move (from H=(7, 7), B=[(6, 7)]):**\nS0 has 1 apple. It is relatively short. Its closest apple is (4, 8) or (8, 8). (8, 8) is 1 move RIGHT, 1 move UP. (4, 8) is 3 moves away (e.g., R, U, U, L).\nIf S0 aims for (8, 8):\n    Move R to (8, 7). Safe.\nIf S0 aims for (4, 8):\n    Move U to (7, 8). Safe.\n    Move L to (6, 7). Collision with its own body? No, (6, 7) is its neck, (6, 7) is safe if S0 moves to (6, 7) which is where its body segment is. Wait, S0 has H=(7, 7) and B=[(6, 7)]. Moving LEFT to (6, 7) *is* hitting its own body segment. **S0 cannot move LEFT.**\n    Possible S0 moves: UP (7, 8), DOWN (7, 6), RIGHT (8, 7).\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (7, 8), it seems to prioritize the upper apples.\n\n**Evaluating S1 Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT to (3, 3):** This moves S1 towards the lower left apples ((3, 0) and (1, 1)). This seems like a good strategic path initiation.\n    *   If S0 moves UP to (7, 8), S1 is safe.\n    *   If S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 7), S1 is safe.\n    *   If S0 moves DOWN to (7, 6), S1 is safe.\n    *   Checking for head-on collisions: (3, 3) is far from S0's safe moves. Safe.\n\n*   **DOWN to (4, 2):** Moves away from immediate apples. Keeps S1 centered for now.\n\nSince the lower apples (3, 0) and (1, 1) are accessible clusters, prioritizing movement towards them seems best, especially since the top apples are very close to S0's current dominant position (7, 7). Moving LEFT puts S1 on a path to cut across the board towards the lower left quadrant.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue heading towards the lower apples, prioritizing (1, 1) then (3, 0). Keep an eye on S0's pathing toward (8, 8) and (4, 8). If S0 commits to the top half, I secure the bottom.\n\nI choose LEFT to start moving towards the lower apples.\n\nLEFT",

Moving DOWN seems slightly more direct towards the closest low apple (3, 0).\n\nLet's check for potential S0 engagement. S0 is moving up to (8, 8). The map is large enough that S0 is not immediately a threat to S1's pathing on the lower left side.

(Length 5, tail at (5, 4) if we assume the body grew by 1 on the last apple eaten)\nSnake #0 Head: (9, 7). Body: [(8, 7)]. Apples: 1.\n\n**Revisiting State Transition:**\nMy last move was DOWN to (3, 2).\n\nNew Head: (3, 2).\nNew Body (since no apple was eaten at (3, 3) previously): The old head (3, 3) becomes the first segment. The body shifts, and the old tail segment drops off.\nOld Body: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]. Assuming this list is Head-to-Tail for Turn 9, and the snake length is 4 (3 apples collected). If length is 4, the actual segments are (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), and the 4th segment remains based on the move before T9.\n\nLet's use the provided data for Turn 10:\n**Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 2), Body: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]. Apples collected: 3.**\n\nThis means my move DOWN to (3, 2) was successful (no apple eaten at (3, 2) on T9, hence the body shrunk by 1 segment, which is what happens when no apple is eaten).\nCurrent Length = 4 segments + 1 head = 5 total cells.\n\n**Self-Collision Check Zones (Body segments S1):** (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4).\n\n**Enemy Snake S0 Moves:**\nS0 Head: (9, 7).

S0 score becomes 2. New body includes (9, 8).\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (9, 6): It moves away from apples, but stays near the edge.\n\n**My Target Apples:** (3, 0) [Distance 2 DOWN], (1, 1) [Distance 1 LEFT, 1 DOWN].\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (3, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 3):** Collision with self segment! (3, 3) is the segment immediately behind (3, 2). **DEADLY.** (This is moving directly back to where my head was last turn).\n    *Self-Correction: My previous rationale targeted (3, 0). If I had moved DOWN last turn, I should be pointing UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from (3, 2). Moving up leads to (3, 3), which is occupied by my former position and is now my immediate rear segment.*\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 1):** Moves towards (3, 0). Safe from self (Body is at (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)). Safe from S0.\n    If S0 moves UP to (9, 8) (eats apple), S1 moves to (3, 1). This keeps S1 focused on low apples.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 2):** Moves towards (1, 1). Safe from self. Safe from S0.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** Safe from self. Safe from S0. Doesn't immediately advance towards nearest apples.\n\n**Comparing DOWN (3, 1) vs LEFT (2, 2):**\n*   DOWN (3, 1) -> Next turn aims for (3, 0) at (3, 0). (2 moves total)\n*   LEFT (2, 2) -> Next turn aims for (1, 1) at (1, 2) or (2, 1). (2 moves total to reach the row/column range).\n\n(3, 0) is slightly closer in Chebyshev distance (2 vs 2), but Manhattan distance favors (3, 0) (2 vs 3). Let's prioritize (3, 0).\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (3, 1).\nIf S0 moves UP to (9, 8) (eats apple). S0 new head (9, 8). S0 body: [(9, 8), (8, 7)].\n\nNext turn (T11), S1 can move DOWN to (3, 0) and eat an apple, becoming length 5. This seems like a strong, deterministic sequence.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Prioritize securing the low apples (3, 0) then (1, 1). Since S0 is moving towards the high apples (8, 8), there is no immediate conflict. Continue pathing towards (3, 0).\n\nMove DOWN to (3, 1).\n\nDOWN",

If I moved DOWN from (3, 2) (T10 Head) to (3, 1) (T11 Head), and **no apple was eaten**, the body shifts: (3, 2) becomes the new S1, (3, 3) becomes S2, (4, 3) becomes S3. The old tail drops. This perfectly matches the given board state if the state provided reflects the results of T10 moves.\n\n**My Targets:** (3, 0) [Distance 1 DOWN], (1, 1) [Distance 1 LEFT, 1 DOWN]. (3, 0) is the absolute closest.\n\n**Opponent S0 Position:** (9, 6).

Yes.\n    *   Eats Apple? Yes, (3, 0) is an apple. I will grow to length 5.\n    *   Collision with S0? S0 moves simultaneously. Max range S0 can cover: 1 unit. The closest S0 can get to (3, 0) is one of its moves toward (3, 0). S0 is at (9, 6). S0 cannot reach (3, 0). **SAFE.**\n\n2.  **UP to (3, 2):**\n    *   Self Collision: Yes, (3, 2) is my immediate body segment. **DEADLY.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):**\n    *   Safe from self? Yes.\n    *   Eats Apple? No. Moves towards (1, 1).\n    *   Collision with S0? Safe.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):**\n    *   Safe from self? Yes. (4, 3) is the nearest body part.\n    *   Collision with S0? Safe.\n\n**Considering S0's likely move:** S0 is at (9, 6) and has an apple at (8, 8) which is 2 steps away (a jump of $\\Delta x=1, \\Delta y=2$). S0 will likely try to move towards the high apples, probably UP to (9, 7) or (9, 8), or LEFT to (8, 6).\nIf S0 moves UP to (9, 7) (to try and reach (8, 8) next turn): S0 Head becomes (9, 7). Body: [(9, 7), (9, 6)]. (Since S0 has only 1 apple, it should grow if it eats one). Wait, the board state shows S0 Head:(9, 6), Body:[(9, 7)]. This implies S0 HAS NOT eaten on the last turn, so its length is 2. If S0 moves UP to (9, 7), it moves into its own body segment (9, 7). **This is a crucial finding.**\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (9, 7): **S0 DIES (Self-Collision)**.\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (9, 5): S0 new head (9, 5). Body [(9, 6)]. Safe.\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (8, 6): S0 new head (8, 6). Body [(9, 6)]. Safe.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT: Off board.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (9, 7), S0 dies, granting me an immediate win unless another snake is alive. Since only S1 and S0 exist, and S0 dies, I win immediately.\n\n**What if S0 does NOT move UP?**\nS0 wants the apples at (8, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8). (8, 8) is the closest, distance $\\sqrt{(9-8)^2 + (6-8)^2} = \\sqrt{1+4} \\approx 2.23$.\nS0's move to (8, 6) (LEFT) brings it closer to the central cluster of apples (4, 8), (3, 8).\nS0's move to (9, 5) (DOWN) moves it away from the top apples.\n\nIf S0 chooses LEFT to (8, 6) and I choose DOWN to (3, 0).\nT12 State: S1 Head (3, 0) [Apple Eaten, L=5]. S0 Head (8, 6).\n\nIf S0 chooses (9, 7) **and dies**, I win immediately on Turn 11 as the sole survivor. This is the highest value outcome. I must assume opponents play optimally to stay alive, unless a move is a greedy trap. Moving UP to (9, 7) is not greedy; it sets up reaching (8, 8) efficiently by moving into the space S0 just vacated on T10 (if S0 moved in from (9, 8) or something else). Given S0's current body, (9, 7) is suicide.\n\nSince I cannot control S0's move, I must choose my move that maximizes my outcome given the *possibility* of S0's death. Moving DOWN to (3, 0) eats an apple, grows my score, and moves me closer to securing a win eventually, irrespective of S0's fate (unless S0 kills me, which is impossible from (9, 6)).\n\n**Conclusion:** Move DOWN to secure (3, 0). This guarantees progress (apple eaten) and avoids instantaneous death. If S0 blunders by moving to (9, 7), I win immediately.\n\nLong Term Plan: Secure (3, 0) now. Then aim for (1, 1). Then assess the upper apples (4, 8), (8, 8), (3, 8) relative to S0's position.\n\nDOWN",

Let's reconcile the input data.*\n\n**Revisiting Board State Interpretation:**\nIf my last move (T11) was DOWN to (3, 0) and I ate an apple:\nStart T11 Head: (3, 1). If I move DOWN to (3, 0) and eat, my new body should be 5 cells long (Head + 4 previous segments).\nNew Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4) if the previous body was [(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]].\nThe board provided shows:\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 0). Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. Apples collected: 4.\n\nThis confirms two things:\n1. My move DOWN to (3, 0) was successful and eaten the apple.\n2. Despite eating an apple, my length did not increase according to the listed body segments (4 existing segments + 1 head = 5 length, but only 4 body cells listed). This strongly implies the listed score/length/body structure is what results *after* the tail has been dropped if no growth occurs, but since an apple was eaten, growth should usually occur, meaning the body list provided *should* be 5 segments long if the previous state was 4 segments.\n\nGiven: Head (3, 0). Body: 4 segments. Total length 5. Apples: 4.\nIf I ate an apple at (3, 0), my score *should* be 5, and my length 6 (5 body segments).\n\nSince the input explicitly states **Apples collected: 4**, and the body size is 5 cells total (Head + 4 body segments), this means **I did NOT eat the apple at (3, 0) on the last turn, OR the apple count provided is lagging, OR the board depiction is slightly inconsistent with the official count/length mechanics for T11.**\n\nLet's trust the immediate board state provided for Turn 12:\nHead: (3, 0). Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. Length 5. Apple Count: 4.\nThis means my last move resulted in the head moving to (3, 0) and the tail segment dropping off, *without* eating the apple at (3, 0) or the apple at (3, 0) was already gone.\nSince the rationale for T11 assumed eating (3, 0), and the resulting board shows H(3, 0) and Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)], this state implies the player moved to (3, 0) but **DID NOT** eat an apple, and the tail segment from T10 moved to (4, 3). This is highly unusual if (3, 0) was an apple, but I must proceed from the given current state.\n\n**Current State Analysis (T12):**\nMy Head: (3, 0). Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)].

(S0 must have moved DOWN from (9, 6) to (9, 5) on T11, avoiding the suicidal UP move, and did not eat).\n\n**Safety from Last Turn's Potential Suicide:** S0 did not move to (9, 7), thus S0 is alive at (9, 5).\n\n**My Safety Check (From H=(3, 0)):**\nSelf Body: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3).\n1. UP to (3, 1): Self collision. **DEADLY.**\n2. DOWN: Off board (y=-1). **DEADLY.**\n3. LEFT to (2, 0): Safe from self.\n4. RIGHT to (4, 0): Safe from self.\n\n**Available Moves:** LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy S0 Position Check (From H=(9, 5)):**\nS0 Body: (9, 6).\nS0 Safety: S0 cannot move UP to (9, 6) (self collision).\nS0 possible moves: DOWN (9, 4), LEFT (8, 5), RIGHT (off board).\n\n**Evaluating My Options (LEFT vs RIGHT):**\n\n**Option 1: LEFT to (2, 0)**\n*   Approaches apple (1, 1) diagonally.\n*   Moves away from S0 (which is on the far right).\n*   Allows me to move UP to (2, 1) or RIGHT to (3, 0) next turn, or potentially DOWN if the board boundary rules allowed movement to (2, -1) (they don't).\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (4, 0)**\n*   Moves towards the center mass of apples (4, 8), (3, 8).\n*   If I move RIGHT to (4, 0), my next move can be UP to (4, 1) or LEFT to (3, 0).\n\n**Comparing Destinations:**\n(1, 1) is 1 move away if I go LEFT, then UP. Total 2 moves.\n(4, 8) is far away. (8, 8) is far away.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 0):\nT13 options: UP (2, 1) [Now targeting (1, 1)]. LEFT (1, 0). RIGHT (3, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 0):\nT13 options: UP (4, 1). LEFT (3, 0). RIGHT (5, 0).\n\nGoing LEFT puts me closer to the isolated apple (1, 1) which might be vulnerable to S0 if S0 decides to sweep across the bottom edge, though S0 seems focused on the top apples. Since I only have two choices, and both are safe, the one that leads towards an apple seems slightly preferable. (1, 1) is 2 moves away via LEFT -> UP.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 0), and S0 moves LEFT to (8, 5).\nS1: (2, 0). S0: (8, 5). Clear separation.\n\nI choose LEFT to begin pathing towards (1, 1), the closest accessible apple that isn't instantly blocked by my own body.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Strategy Note:**\nMy immediate threat comes from self-collision (must move LEFT or RIGHT). I choose LEFT primarily to approach apple (1, 1) via (2, 1) next turn. I must monitor S0's movements towards the high cluster of apples (8, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8) relative to my position. I need to aim for 5 apples next to stay ahead of S0's current score of 1.\n\nLEFT",

Based on the analysis of Turn 12, my snake is at (3, 0) and must move either LEFT or RIGHT to survive.\n\n**Current State Review (T13 Start):**\nMy Head: (3, 0). Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. Score: 4. (Length 5)\nApples: (8, 8), (4, 8), (1, 1), (3, 8), (9, 8).\nEnemy S0 Head: (9, 5). Body: [(9, 6)]. Score: 1. (Length 2)\n\n**Safety Check at (3, 0):**\n1. UP to (3, 1): Collision with self. **DEADLY.**\n2. DOWN: Off board. **DEADLY.**\n3. LEFT to (2, 0): Safe from self.\n4. RIGHT to (4, 0): Safe from self.\n\n**Enemy Potential Moves (S0 at (9, 5), Body at (9, 6)):**\nS0 cannot move UP to (9, 6).\nS0 Options (Safe/Possible):\n*   DOWN to (9, 4)\n*   LEFT to (8, 5)\n*   RIGHT: Off board.\n\n**Evaluating My Choices (LEFT vs RIGHT):**\n\n**Choice 1: LEFT to (2, 0)**\n*   Next Turn Progression: I will aim for UP to (2, 1) to set up a path to apple (1, 1) in two turns (LEFT -> UP -> LEFT/DOWN).\n*   Collision Risk this turn: If S0 moves LEFT to (8, 5), no collision risk. If S0 moves DOWN to (9, 4), no collision risk. Collision is impossible this turn as S0 is too far away.\n\n**Choice 2: RIGHT to (4, 0)**\n*   Next Turn Progression: I will aim for UP to (4, 1) to start moving toward the cluster of apples centered around y=8.\n*   I end up in the middle of the bottom edge, potentially leading to more constrained vertical movement if I go too far right. (4, 0) is adjacent to my current body segment (3, 1) if I move UP next turn. Wait, body segments are (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3). Moving RIGHT to (4, 0) is safe and doesn't immediately block my path back toward the center column (x=3).\n\n**Comparison:**\nGoing LEFT (to 2, 0) prepares a direct path towards the isolated apple (1, 1) over the next two turns (LEFT -> UP -> LEFT).\nGoing RIGHT (to 4, 0) keeps me centered but allows a quicker path upwards towards the main apple cluster (4, 8), (3, 8). From (4, 0), I can immediately go UP to (4, 1) on Turn 14.\n\nSince the apples at the top of the board (4, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 9, 8) are much more numerous (5 apples) than the single isolated apple (1, 1), aiming towards the center/top cluster seems strategically superior, even if it takes a few more turns to reach them from the bottom edge. (4, 0) is adjacent to column 3, which I occupied previously, giving me flexibility.\n\nI choose RIGHT to move toward the central grouping of apples.\n\nStrategic Outlook for next few turns: Aim to move up columns 3 or 4 toward Y=8. Need to be wary of S0 potentially trying to cut me off if it moves up rapidly, though S0's current position (9, 5) is far from me.\n\nRIGHT",
