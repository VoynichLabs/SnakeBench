If I move DOWN to (3, 3), the enemy could move UP to (3, 3) for a head-on collision. However, let me reconsider: the enemy might move in a different direction. But since I have safer alternatives, DOWN is unnecessarily risky.\n\n**Best Path Forward:**\n- RIGHT to (4, 4) moves me toward the (5, 4) apple cluster\n- This keeps me in the middle of the board with good access to multiple apple regions\n- From (4, 4), I can reach (5, 4) in one more move RIGHT\n- After collecting those middle apples, I can move UP toward (3, 9) or (6, 8)\n\nUP is also safe but moves away from the nearest accessible apple (5, 4). RIGHT is the better strategic choice because:\n1. It's safe\n2. It moves me toward the (5, 4) apple (only 1 more move away)\n3. It keeps me centrally positioned for future apple access\n4. It maintains distance from the enemy snake\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 4: Move RIGHT again to (5, 4) to collect that apple\n- Turn 5+: After collecting (5, 4), evaluate whether to go for (3, 9) UP or (6, 8) diagonal\n- Continue building length and collecting apples while monitoring enemy position\n- Keep safe distance from enemy snake #0\n\nRIGHT",

The remaining apples are:\n- (1, 4) - lower left, distance ~7 cells\n- (3, 9) - upper left, distance ~7+ cells\n- (6, 8) - upper middle, distance ~6 cells\n- (5, 8) - upper middle, distance ~5 cells\n- (7, 7) - upper right, distance ~5 cells\n\nThe closest apples are the upper cluster: (7, 7), (5, 8), and (6, 8). I should move northward to pursue these.\n\n**Direction evaluation:**\n- **UP**: Moves toward the upper apple cluster (7, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8). This is efficient and keeps me moving toward high-value targets.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to the board edge, limits future maneuverability and doesn't help reach apples.\n- **DOWN**: Moves away from all apples, inefficient.\n- **LEFT**: Blocked by my own body.\n\nUP is the clear best choice - it moves me directly toward the nearest apple cluster.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. Turn 13+: Continue moving UP to reach (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)\n2. From (8, 7), I can move LEFT to approach (7, 7) apple\n3. After collecting (7, 7), continue to (6, 8) and (5, 8) in the upper cluster\n4. The enemy snake at (4, 0) has no body and is far from my path, no immediate threat\n5. Stay aware of potential collisions but the upper path seems clear\n\nUP",
