Only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\n4) **Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n   - **UP to (9, 4):**\n     - Moves toward the center of the board, away from edges.\n     - Avoids the enemy's head at (9, 5) (which could move DOWN to (9, 4) next turn, risking a head-on collision).\n     - Opens space for future moves toward apples at (8, 1) or (1, 3).\n   - **DOWN to (9, 2):**\n     - Moves toward the bottom edge, closer to apples at (8, 0) and (4, 0).\n     - Riskier if the enemy moves DOWN to (9, 4) next turn, as it could trap me near the edge.\n     - Less future flexibility due to proximity to the edge.\n\n5) **Enemy's Likely Moves:**\n   - The enemy's head is at (9, 5). Their likely moves:\n     - UP: (9, 6) \u2013 their body, unsafe\n     - DOWN: (9, 4) \u2013 empty, safe\n     - LEFT: (8, 5) \u2013 empty, safe\n     - RIGHT: off the board, unsafe\n   - The enemy is likely to move DOWN or LEFT. Moving DOWN to (9, 4) would put them adjacent to my head if I move UP to (9, 4), risking a head-on collision next turn.\n\n6) **Risk Assessment:**\n   - UP is safer because it avoids the enemy's likely DOWN move and keeps me away from the edge.\n   - DOWN is riskier due to potential enemy movement and edge proximity.\n\n7) **Long-Term Plan:**\n   - Avoid the enemy's head and body, especially near the right edge.\n   - Aim for apples at (8, 1) or (1, 3) after moving UP.\n   - Keep future options open by staying near the center of the board.\n\n**Move:** UP",

UP: (9,6) - into your own body (invalid)\n2. DOWN: (9,4) - safe\n3. LEFT: (8,5) - safe\n4. RIGHT: (10,5) - off the board (invalid)\n\nFirst, eliminate invalid moves:\n- UP is invalid (would hit your own body)\n- RIGHT is invalid (would go off the board)\n\nNow evaluate safe moves:\n1. DOWN to (9,4):\n   - Safe\n   - Moves toward apple at (8,1)\n   - Could potentially reach apple at (8,1) in next few moves\n   - Enemy is at (9,3) so we need to be cautious about potential head-on collision\n\n2. LEFT to (8,5):\n   - Safe\n   - Moves away from most apples\n   - Could potentially reach apple at (4,0) but that's far\n   - Leaves us vulnerable to enemy movement\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- DOWN is the best move as it allows us to move toward an apple at (8,1)\n- We need to be careful about the enemy snake at (9,3) which could move up toward us\n- Moving DOWN positions us well to potentially eat apples at (8,1) next turn\n- Moving LEFT positions us away from apples and could lead to a dead-end\n\nPotential enemy movement:\n- Enemy is at (9,3) with body at (8,3), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)\n- They might move toward apples at (1,3), (8,1), or (4,0)\n- If they move UP to (9,4), they would be closer to our body\n- We need to be prepared for this possibility\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move DOWN to (9,4) to position ourselves near apple at (8,1)\n- Next turn, we can potentially move DOWN to (9,3) to position ourselves near apple at (8,1)\n- Continue monitoring enemy movements to prevent them from cutting us off from apples\n\nFinal decision: DOWN is the best move as it allows us to move toward an apple while keeping us safe.\n\nDOWN",
