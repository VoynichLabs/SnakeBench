Apples nearby: (4,8) is the most immediately reachable one.\n\nStep-by-step thinking (fans want the play-by-play):\n1) Check all four directions:\n   - UP -> (8,10) \u2192 off the board = instant DEATH. No way.\n   - DOWN -> (8,8) \u2192 empty, on-board. Safe.\n   - LEFT -> (7,9) \u2192 empty, on-board. Safe.\n   - RIGHT -> (9,9) \u2192 empty, on-board. Safe.\n2) Eliminate obvious killers: UP is out. The other three are alive choices.\n3) Among safe moves, prefer options that:\n   - Keep the most escape routes open,\n   - Move me closer to reachable apples,\n   - Avoid likely head-on collisions this turn.\n\nQuick evaluation:\n- RIGHT to (9,9) puts me in the top-right corner \u2014 fewer future options (only left or down). Also it's farther from the nearest apple (4,8).\n- LEFT to (7,9) is okay: 3 options next turn and gets slightly closer to apple (4,8).\n- DOWN to (8,8) is best: it's inside the board with the most follow-up moves (up/back, left, right, down), and it reduces Manhattan distance to the nearby apple (4,8) to 4. Very low collision risk \u2014 opponent is far away.\n\nLong-term plan (quick note to future me):\n- Move DOWN now to get into the 8-row corridor toward (4,8). From there, keep pressure leftwards across row 8, pick up (4,8) safely, and avoid cornering myself. If opponent approaches from the south, use superior mobility in open space to force them into collisions or trap them along the bottom-left apples.\n\nAlright squad \u2014 execute the safe aggressive play.

No walls, no bodies blocking.\n- Right now there\u2019s no immediate threat from the rival; the board is open enough to stay center and keep options open.\n- Best short-term gain is not critical here; we want a move that preserves future routes toward reachable apples and avoids cornering ourselves.\n\nPlan:\n- Keep it simple and keep the center. Move UP to (5,5) to maintain flexibility for chasing apples like (3,6) or (9,4) in upcoming turns, while staying away from any tight spots.\n- In subsequent turns, diagonally approach nearby apples (e.g., head toward (3,6) or (9,4)) while watching for potential head-on lines the opponent could pursue. Avoid giving the rival a straight line into you; don\u2019t trap yourself against walls.\n- If the opponent makes a bold chase, react by widening the path instead of tightening a trap; survival comes first, then apple-gathering advantage.\n\nMOVE PLAN FOR THIS TURN: UP\n\nUP",

Time to think fast and clean.\n\nQuick state scan:\n- Our head: (5,8), length 1 (no body) \u2014 we can move any direction except off-board.\n- Opponent head: (3,6), body at (4,6) (length 2), has 1 apple.\n- Nearby apple: (4,8) is directly LEFT of us. Big content opportunity.\n- No immediate deaths possible this turn from moving into occupied cells except if we deliberately suicided (we won\u2019t).\n\nEvaluate all four moves:\n- UP -> (5,9): legal but hugs the top edge (fewer escape options next turn). Not ideal.\n- RIGHT -> (6,8): legal but moves away from the nearby apple cluster and toward emptier space.\n- DOWN -> (5,7): legal, flexible, but forgoes the easy apple.\n- LEFT -> (4,8): legal, grabs an apple instantly (+1 and +1 length), moves us toward opponent\u2019s quadrant to start pressure.\n\nHead-on collision check:\n- Opponent at (3,6) can go to (3,7),(3,5),(2,6) or (4,6) (the last would be moving into their own body and is unlikely). None of those are (4,8) this turn, so taking (4,8) is not a likely head-on kill. Safe play to seize the apple.\n\nDecision: GO FOR THE APPLE. LEFT picks (4,8) immediately, gives us growth, score, and better leverage to pressure/box the rival in the upper-left quadrant. We\u2019ll avoid hugging the absolute top row after the pickup so we don\u2019t get sealed off.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will be your next last-rationale):\n- LEFT to eat (4,8) now.\n- Next, chain into (3,7) then (3,6) if safe \u2014 growing quickly to create length and use our body to block opponent escapes.\n- Keep at least one column/row of escape (don\u2019t hug y=9) so we can pivot and cut opponent off rather than trap ourselves.\n- If opponent tries to rush us head-on, bait them into collisions or force them into their own body by occupying escape tiles.\n\nLET\u2019S BOX HIM \u2014 EYES ON THE APPLE, HANDS ON THE CLUTCH.

LEFT -> (3,8) risks the opponent turning UP into (3,8) for a mutual KO. RIGHT is illegal (back into our neck).

If opponent commits to a risky head-on, capitalize on it \u2014 we survive, they die, we clean up apples.\n\nLET\u2019S PLAY SMART, NOT GREASY.

RIGHT nudges us directly toward that apple while keeping multiple escape options (we can still go up or down or continue right), so it\u2019s the slightly better mix of aggression and safety.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Push to (6,6) quickly to nab that apple (grow + control).\n- After eating, loop toward the (5,4)/(4,1) cluster while hugging open space \u2014 avoid sealing ourselves into the lower-left corner.\n- If opponent drifts toward top apples, take outside lanes and prioritize controlling middle-right space to box them in later.

Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- Check collisions this turn: opponent head at (1,6) is far away and can\u2019t contest our immediate neighbors. No immediate head-on threats.\n\nCandidate moves:\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,5): safe. Puts us one step away from apple at (5,4). Keeps multiple follow-ups (UP/LEFT/DOWN). Good for grabbing the (5,4) apple quickly.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,5): safe. Pushes toward right-side apples (9,6 / 9,4) but slower to center apples. Still open.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,4): safe. Moves us toward the central/bottom apple lane (targets: (5,4) then (6,2)/(6,0)). Keeps pivot options left/right/down and preserves central board control.\n\nWhy I like DOWN right now:\n- Keeps us centralized between left and right apple clusters so we can react to enemy movement \u2014 flex > tunnel. \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b\n- Directly lines up the (6,2)/(6,0) apples and still lets us detour to grab (5,4) next turn if needed.\n- No immediate threats from the opponent; staying central maximizes mobility and reduces chance of getting boxed as map fills.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (6,4). Next turn evaluate: if (5,4) is still free, pivot LEFT to snatch it; otherwise continue DOWN to (6,2) and eat the column-6 apples. If opponent drifts right, pivot to contest 9,x apples. Always prefer moves that keep \u22652 follow-ups open.\n\nAlright squad \u2014 lock it in, push center, collect fruit, and set up a box later. You feeling me?

Safe, no nearby head-on threat. Grabbing it grows us and keeps multiple exits (UP/LEFT/DOWN) open next turn. Good immediate content and maintains mobility.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4): free, keeps options but passes on instant apple. Slightly drifts right cluster, slower to content.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3): free, keeps center control but also passes the easy apple at (5,4).\n\nDecision: TAKE THE APPLE. LEFT to (5,4) nets +1 apple, grows our length (more scoring), and still leaves \u22652 follow-ups so we won't get boxed next turn. Opponent is too far to threaten a head-on. Grab now, plan to use the extra segment to pressure and maneuver into a box later.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- After LEFT and apple, evaluate opponent drift.

Neck: (6,4) \u2192 moving RIGHT is directly into our neck (illegal). Don\u2019t do it. We live to fight another turn.\n- Opponent head at (1,4) is far left \u2014 not an immediate head-on threat this turn.\n- Nearby apples worth considering: (6,2), (6,0), (4,1), (9,4) \u2014 best cluster is down/right toward the 6,x apples.\n\nMove-by-move thinking (keepin\u2019 it savage):\n- RIGHT \u2192 illegal (back into our neck at (6,4)). Auto-drop.\n- UP \u2192 would go to (5,5). That\u2019s okay now, but from (5,5) our RIGHT move would be into our own body at (6,5) (blocked), and DOWN would be back into the neck \u2014 so UP reduces our exits to ~2. Risky if we wanna avoid getting corralled.\n- LEFT \u2192 to (4,4) is safe and gives 3 exits (UP/LEFT/DOWN). Good mobility and heads toward the (4,1) apple cluster.\n- DOWN \u2192 to (5,3) is safe and gives 3 exits (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN). Critically it moves us toward the juicy cluster at (6,2) and (6,0) where we can chain apples soon.\n\nWhy I PICK DOWN:\n- Preserves plenty of escape routes (3 options).\n- Moves us toward reachable apple cluster (6,2 \u2192 6,0), giving a high chance to chain snacks and grow length control.\n- Keeps us centrally positioned to pivot left/right for zoning or to rotate and box the opponent later. We\u2019re not hugging the wall or getting trapped by our own tail.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- After DOWN to (5,3), look to step RIGHT\u2192(6,3) and then DOWN\u2192(6,2) to pick that apple safely. From there, pivot to (6,0)/(7,1) chain if uncontested.\n- Keep at least 2 open exits each turn; avoid moving into corridors that cut off escape routes.\n- If opponent drifts toward center, bait them into chasing into our tail or force them into head-on conflicts when advantageous.\n\nLet\u2019s make this clean, grab apples, then bake the rival into a box.

Neck is (5,4) \u2192 UP is illegal (would go straight into our neck).

Solid for space control.\n- RIGHT (6,3): safe now, but UP from there is (6,4) which is occupied by our own body segment, so RIGHT reduces future mobility (fewer clean exits). It does put us one step closer to the (6,2) apple though.\n- DOWN (5,2): safe and the most flexible. From (5,2) we have three clean exits (left/right/down) and can pivot RIGHT\u2192(6,2) to pick that apple next turn.

We got three candidates: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n- LEFT \u2192 ILLEGAL (back into neck). \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (7,3): safe, keeps space, no apple. Decent defensive option. \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,2): safe, keeps wide space, no apple immediate. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,1): APPLE! (then another apple at 7,0 behind it). High-value greedy play. \u2705\u2705\n\nOpponent (head at 2,1) is nowhere near us \u2014 they can grab (2,0) this turn but can\u2019t threaten our head-next cell. No head-on risk for (7,1). Moving DOWN gets us an apple immediately and sets up a fast follow-up to (7,0). Yes, we grow this turn (so tail won\u2019t vacate), but there\u2019s plenty of room \u2014 we\u2019re not getting boxed by their snake on the left.\n\nRisk check: moving DOWN does not run into our own body or opponent body; no simultaneous head clash expected. It\u2019s the highest reward safe move: ties the scoreboard and keeps us in control of the bottom-right corridor for a moment.\n\nShort-term plan (for the replay/next rationale):\n- Take (7,1) now (DOWN) \u2192 grow and tie apples.\n- Next turn likely go DOWN again to take (7,0) if safe, then pivot to open space (avoid hugging our own body).\n- Always keep 2 escape options after apple pickups; don\u2019t spiral into the (5,x) cluster.\n\nTime to cash this apple \u2014 LET\u2019S EAT.\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s break it down like a boss.\n\nDecision process\n- Safe moves from (2,1): \n  - UP -> (2,2):SAFE\n  - DOWN -> (2,0):SAFE and there\u2019s an apple there\n  - LEFT -> (1,1):HIT own neck (not allowed)\n  - RIGHT -> (3,1):SAFE\n- Immediate apple check: DOWN to (2,0) will eat an apple now (+1) and keep options open along the bottom corridor. That\u2019s a clean value gain with no obvious trap.\n- Opponent awareness: Snake #0 is at (7,2) with a short body far away. The bottom row is relatively open; grabbing (2,0) doesn\u2019t invite a head-on collision this turn.\n- Future flexibility: DOWN keeps me on a straight path to more low-risk routes (towards (0,0) or (4,1) area) while not zigzagging into a tight trap.\n\nMove choice\n- Best immediate play: DOWN to (2,0). It gives +1 apple this turn, stays safe, and preserves future options.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns)\n- After grabbing (2,0), funnel along the bottom row to pick up nearby cheap apples and avoid tight corners that could box you in.\n- Maintain lanes that let you pivot between left, right, and up without crashing into your own body or the rival\u2019s head.\n- Keep an eye on the rival\u2019s chase: if they slip toward (7,1) or (6,0) you can pressure with timely lateral moves to force missteps or head-on risks.\n- Aim to snatch the easier apples at (0,0) and (0,1) or (4,1) if safe, while keeping a flexible tail so you can swing to the center if the opponent tries to corral you.\n\n DOWN",

It\u2019s empty of bodies and no enemy head can reach that cell this turn. \u2705\u2705\n\nRisk/Reward:\n- DOWN gets us an immediate apple and ties the score (we go from 5 \u2192 6). The apple at (6,0) sits right next to it, so we can likely chain to (6,0) next turn and pull ahead. Opponent at (2,0) is too far to contest head-on collisions at (7,0)/(6,0).\n- Note: when we eat (7,0) we WILL grow this turn (tail won\u2019t vacate), and on the next turn UP (back to (7,1)) will be illegal (that becomes our neck). So after DOWN we must plan to go LEFT or RIGHT \u2014 LEFT to (6,0) is perfect (another apple) and keeps space open; RIGHT to (8,0) is also available if needed.\n- LEFT or RIGHT now are safe but lower immediate reward. LEFT would move us into a narrower corridor near our body cluster; RIGHT keeps more open space but for less apples immediate.\n\nPlan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will be our last-rationale note):\n- Take (7,0) now (DOWN) \u2192 grow and tie apples.\n- Next turn go LEFT to (6,0) to chain another apple (push to 7 apples).\n- After that, avoid turning back into our own body; pivot north along x=6 or open to the right side to avoid getting boxed by our own tail. Keep at least two escape options after pickups.\n\nMake the greedy, safe play \u2014 grab the apple and set up the double pickup. LET\u2019S EAT. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Taking this apple grows us, so plan next turn to avoid turning back into our neck \u2014 prefer moving UP to (6,1) or LEFT to (5,0) depending on empty squares and opponent movement. Long-term: chain toward the nearby apple cluster (4,1) / (3,7) region while keeping at least two escape options to avoid getting boxed.\n\nLET\u2019S SNATCH THIS POINT \u2014 LEFT\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s a single escape route \u2014 risky, easy to box.\n- If we go LEFT to (5,0): we also don\u2019t eat now, but we retain two clean follow-ups next turn (LEFT to 4,0 or UP to 5,1). That keeps more mobility and lets us approach nearby apples (notably (4,1)) while avoiding getting funneled.\n\nLong-term plan (quick): stay mobile \u2014 head toward the (4,1) / (3,3) apple cluster while keeping at least two escape options each turn. Avoid moving into tight columns where our own body blocks exits (don\u2019t trap ourselves against our tail).

Long-term, keep pressuring the left column to funnel Snake #0 into space you control, and use the wall as a shield as you edge toward apples in the top-left quadrant.

The apple reward accelerates growth and length, which helps us out-grow the opponent and keep room to maneuver. Standing still on the left wall also keeps Snake #0 out of a direct, fast boxing lane for a few turns.\n- Long-term strategy: keep hugging the left wall, funnel Snake #0 into open space, and chase top-left/upper-area apples when safe. Avoid risky head-ons; prioritize safe follow-ups and maintaining multiple escape routes.\n- Risk assessment: Snake #0 is far on the right-bottom; heading to (0,5) won\u2019t invite an immediate clash.

Neck: (4,2) \u2192 RIGHT is a straight-up illegal backward move. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- Nearby apples: (3,3) is right above us \u2014 clean pickup if we go UP. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nQuick legal sweep from (3,2):\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,2) = our neck \u2192 ILLEGAL. Dead move. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (3,3) = apple, free cell. \u2705 We\u2019d eat and grow (gain +1 apple \u2192 tie 9-9), and still have 3 follow-up directions next turn (no down because that would be back into neck).\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,2) = free. \u2705 Safe and keeps multiple exits (up/left/down) but skips immediate apple.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,1) = free. \u2705 Also safe, but farther from apples and gives less immediate reward.\n\nCollision risk check:\n- Opponent head at (0,5) can\u2019t reach (3,3) this turn. No head-on threat to the apple. Simultaneous move rules are fine here \u2014 we won\u2019t collide with them by going up.\n\nWhy I pick UP:\n- Grabbing (3,3) now gives us the apple AND center control. High-value, low-risk. \ud83c\udf4f\u26a1\n- Growth is fine \u2014 we\u2019re not boxed in; from (3,3) we still have solid escape options (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) next turn.\n- Keeps pressure \u2014 tying apples forces the rival to be aggressive and makes them more likely to blunder into the wall or our trap. Let\u2019s bait them left-wall into a choke. \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- UP to nab (3,3) \u2192 force them to make a play. If they approach center, look for head-on or wall-trap opportunities.\n- After eating, prioritize maintaining at least two escape directions; avoid committing to x>=5 corridor unless we open space.\n- If opponent hugs left wall, start circling to box them between our body and the wall. Patience + pressure = crash. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n\nFinal move:\nUP",

Crowd\u2019s hyped, I\u2019m calm, we do math and pressure. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick legal-check from head (3,4):\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,3) is our neck \u2192 BACKWARDS \u2192 ILLEGAL. Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,4) is free. Gets closer to (1,3) apple, but narrows escape a bit and moves us away from the top apple cluster.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,4) is free. Puts us towards the right/apple corridor (6,4)/(6,3)/(7,3) but edges us nearer our own body below.\n- UP \u2192 (3,5) is free. Keeps 3 exit options next turn (L/R/U), advances toward the (3,7)/(4,7) apple cluster, and helps us control center to start boxing the opponent on the left wall. \ud83c\udfaf\n\nHead-on / immediate-death checks:\n- Opponent head is at (0,7). They cannot reach any of our candidate cells this turn (only legal moves for them are UP to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,7)), so no instant head-on threat this move. Safe to be aggressive.\n\nWhy I pick UP:\n- Maximizes follow-up options (we keep escape routes open), moves us toward the high-value apples at y=7, and helps build the wall/pressure for a future box-in of the left-wall snake. We don\u2019t want to sprint left for the (1,3) apple and give them room to slip out \u2014 instead we press center-up, then pivot right to hem them in between our body and the wall. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf4e\n- Low immediate risk, high positional value. Classic streamer brain move.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep ascending toward the (3,7)/(4,7) cluster while keeping at least two safe exits each move.\n- If opponent climbs, start shifting rightward to seal them against the left wall; force them into tighter vertical runs and jump the choke with a cut when they have fewer exits.\n- Prioritize not getting trapped between our body and the board edge \u2014 maintain flexibility and take the apples that are safe.\n\nFinal move:\nUP",

Opponent head: (3,4).\n- Board 10x10. A LOT of apples scattered, especially along the top row (1,9), (9,9), etc.\n- Immediate threats: moving into your own neck (DOWN) or off the board (LEFT) is dead. RIGHT and UP are both safe this turn.\n\nSAFE CHOICES THIS TURN\n- UP to (0,8) \u2014 safe, keeps you on the edge, maintains multiple escape routes.\n- RIGHT to (1,7) \u2014 safe, opens interior lines but could invite future pressure if the opponent closes in.\n- DOWN/LEFT are lethal (into your body or off the board).\n\nWHY I LIKE UP THIS TURN\n- Keeps the left-wall funnel intact, preserving easy escape and avoidable traps.\n- Sets up a clean path to climb to (0,9) next turn, then swing RIGHT to grab the top-row apple at (1,9).\n- Opponent is still playin\u2019 catch-up; we can milk the top-row apples without getting boxed in.\n\nALTERNATE CONSIDERATION (IF WE WENT RIGHT)\n- Going RIGHT now risks giving the opponent a chance to pinch the left column later, and pushes us into a more crowded space with less guaranteed escape.\n- Could aim for top-right apples quicker, but at the cost of safety and consistency.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (NEXT FEW TURNS)\n- Turn 28: UP to (0,8) (maintain edge control).\n- Turn 29: If still safe, UP to (0,9) to threaten the top row.\n- Then Turn 30: RIGHT to (1,9) to eat the apple there and grow, continuing the top-row chase while staying in a controllable funnel.\n- Long-term: keep pressure on the top-left-to-top-right corridor, snack top-row apples when clean paths exist, avoid any head-on with Snake #0, and avoid tight dead-ends.\n\nFAN TINGE QUESTION: Can we actually box him in or outplay him here?\n- Yes, by staying on the left wall and using the top edge when opportunities align. We\u2019ll prioritize safety first while nudging toward apples that don\u2019t trap us in.\n\nFINAL DECISION (for this turn)\n- Move: UP\n\nUP",

Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,5) is free. Low immediate risk but drifts away from the juicy y=7 apples and can start shrinking our maneuver space if we drop later. \ud83e\udd0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,5) is free. Gets toward the right-apple corridor, but edges us closer to our own body column below at x=4 and could complicate a safe drop later. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- UP \u2192 (3,6) is free. Keeps maximum follow-up options and puts us one step closer to the high-value (3,7)/(4,7) cluster. \u2705\n\nHead-on / immediate-death checks:\n- Opponent head at (0,8) is far \u2014 they can only go UP to (0,9) or RIGHT to (1,8). They can't contest our candidate cells this turn. No instant head-on risk. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nWhy I lock UP:\n- Keeps 3 escape directions next turn and advances toward the (3,7)/(4,7) apples \u2014 clean value play. Apples = growth = control. \ud83c\udf4e\n- Preserves flexibility to pivot left or right to start compressing the left-wall hog (they're already hugging x=0). We want to force them into a vertical squeeze and then cut the choke. \ud83c\udfaf\n- Minimizes immediate self-trap risk vs the RIGHT move (which hugs our own lower column) and is strictly better than chasing lower-left apples that let them slip out. Smart aggression > greedy sprint. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep ascending to grab (3,7) then contest (4,7). After grabbing, evaluate opponent movement \u2014 if they try to climb, pivot right to sandwich; if they backtrack along the wall, delay and take safe apples on our side.\n- Maintain at least two safe exits each turn; avoid moving into tight columns that line up with our own body below.\n- If we can pressure them into a 1-exit state (against x=0), time a cut so their head collides with our body or wall.\n\nLet's go make 'em crash.

Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nQuick legal sweep from head (3,6):\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,5) is our neck \u2192 BACKWARDS \u2192 ILLEGAL. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,6) is free. Keeps space but doesn\u2019t immediately secure the apple cluster. \ud83e\udd14  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,6) is free. Moves toward the right-apple corridor but brushes close to our lower body at x=4. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- UP \u2192 (3,7) is an apple and is FREE. Immediate growth + keeps max options. \u2705\n\nOpponent check: their head at (0,9) has only one legal move this turn \u2014 RIGHT to (1,9) (they\u2019ll eat that apple). So NO head-on contest for our nearby apples this turn. They\u2019re forced off the wall, which we can exploit next few turns. \ud83d\udc40\n\nWhy I pick UP:\n- Grabs (3,7) now \u2014 content + growth = control. \ud83c\udf4e  \n- Keeps at least two escape routes for the next turn and lets us swing to (4,7) after, contesting that cluster.  \n- Puts pressure toward the top-right apple corridor so we can pivot to trap the left-wall hog as they peel off. \u2702\ufe0f\n\nShort-term plan (for the replay next turn):\n- Take (3,7) now. If safe, follow to (4,7) to secure the cluster. After that, aim to move up/right to threaten the corridor the opponent will be moving into (they\u2019ll be at/near 1,9 \u2192 2,9). Force them along the edge and then time a cut when they try to re-enter the field. Keep 2+ escape options every turn \u2014 don\u2019t get boxed by our own tail.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that apple and keep the pressure. UP",
