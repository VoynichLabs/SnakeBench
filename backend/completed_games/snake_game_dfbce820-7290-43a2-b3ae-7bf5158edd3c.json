Body is empty (length 1).\n    *   **Enemy Position (Snake 1):** Head at `(8, 3)`. Body is empty (length 1). Distance: Manhattan distance is $|8-4| + |3-4| = 4+1 = 5$ turns away. Direct collision is not an immediate threat this turn, but I must anticipate his move.\n    *   **Apples:** There are many apples. Closest ones to my head are:\n        *   `(4, 1)`: Distance 3 (Down).\n        *   `(3, 2)`: Distance 3 (Left/Down diagonal). Actually, it's $|4-3| + |4-2| = 1+2=3$.\n        *   `(5, 2)`: Distance 3 (Right/Down diagonal). $|4-5| + |4-2| = 1+2=3$.\n        *   `(4, 8)`: Distance 4 (Up).\n    *   **Obstacles/Walls:** The board is 10x10. I am at `(4, 4)`. I am safely inside the board.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves (Safety Check):**\n    *   **UP to (4, 5):** On the board? Yes. Into own body? No (empty). Into enemy body? No (Snake 1 is at `(8, 3)`). Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 3):** On the board? Yes. Into own body? No. Into enemy body? No. However, checking Snake 1's position: Snake 1 is at `(8, 3)`. If Snake 1 moves `LEFT` to `(7, 3)`, or `DOWN` to `(8, 2)`, or `UP` to `(8, 4)`, or `RIGHT` to `(9, 3)`, we do not collide. However, looking at the board state: `(4, 3)` contains an 'A' (Apple). If I move DOWN, I eat the apple at `(4, 3)`. This is safe physically (no collision), but I should check if Snake 1 is targeting this apple. Snake 1 is at `(8, 3)`. To get to `(4, 3)`, Snake 1 would need 4 turns. I can get there in 1 turn. I will get there first.\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 4):** On the board? Yes. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 4):** On the board? Yes. Safe.\n\n    *Self-Correction/Deep Analysis:* Wait, looking at the board state provided:\n    `4 . . A . 0 . . . .`\n    The visual representation shows an apple at `(4, 3)`? No, the row `4` (y=4) shows: `4 . . A . 0 . . . .`.\n    Let's map this:\n    x: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    y=4: `.` `.` `A` `.` `0` `.` `.` `.` `.`\n    The 'A' is at `(2, 4)`.\n    The '0' is at `(4, 4)`.\n    So there is NO apple at `(4, 3)`. The apple at `(4, 3)` is not visible in the grid.\n    Let's re-check the list of apples: `(4, 1), (3, 2), (5, 2)...`\n    There is no `(4, 3)` in the apple list.\n    So `DOWN` to `(4, 3)` is an empty square.\n\n3.  **Strategic Planning:**\n    *   **Goal:** Maximize apple collection while staying safe.\n    *   **Apple Clusters:**\n        *   **Cluster 1 (Bottom Left):** `(0, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (1, 5), (2, 4)`. This cluster is relatively close.\n        *   **Cluster 2 (Top Right):** `(9, 7), (6, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (2, 9)`.\n        *   **Cluster 3 (Mid/Right):** `(9, 7), (5, 3)`.\n    *   **Enemy Analysis (Snake 1 at `(8, 3)`):**\n        *   Snake 1 is in the bottom right quadrant.\n        *   Apples near Snake 1: `(9, 7)` (Up/Right), `(5, 3)` (Left), `(6, 2)` (Down/Left).\n        *   If Snake 1 goes for `(5, 3)`, it is 3 steps away ($|8-5| + |3-3| = 3$).\n        *   If I go for `(5, 3)`, I am 2 steps away ($|4-5| + |4-3| = 1+1=2$).\n        *   If I go for `(3, 2)`, I am 3 steps away ($|4-3| + |4-2| = 1+2=3$).\n        *   If I go for `(4, 1)`, I am 3 steps away ($|4-4| + |4-1| = 0+3=3$).\n        *   If I go for `(2, 3)`, I am 3 steps away ($|4-2| + |4-3| = 2+1=3$).\n    *   **Immediate Move Choice:**\n        *   Moving `UP` to `(4, 5)` opens up the top cluster. `(4, 8)` is 4 steps away from `(4, 5)`. `(2, 9)` is far.\n        *   Moving `LEFT` to `(3, 4)` puts me closer to `(2, 4)` (1 step), `(2, 3)` (2 steps), and `(3, 2)` (2 steps). This seems like a dense cluster.\n        *   Moving `DOWN` to `(4, 3)` puts me closer to `(5, 3)` (1 step), `(4, 1)` (2 steps).\n        *   Moving `RIGHT` to `(5, 4)` puts me closer to `(5, 3)` (1 step), `(6, 2)` (2 steps).\n\n    *   **Collision Check (Simultaneous Movement):**\n        *   If I move `LEFT` to `(3, 4)`:\n            *   Snake 1 might move `LEFT` to `(7, 3)`.\n            *   Snake 1 might move `UP` to `(8, 4)`.\n            *   Snake 1 might move `DOWN` to `(8, 2)`.\n            *   Snake 1 might move `RIGHT` to `(9, 3)`.\n            *   No overlap possible.\n        *   If I move `DOWN` to `(4, 3)`:\n            *   Snake 1 is at `(8, 3)`. If Snake 1 moves `LEFT` to `(7, 3)`, no overlap.\n            *   What if Snake 1 moves `DOWN` or `UP`? No overlap.\n            *   However, there is an apple at `(5, 3)`. If Snake 1 sees it, it might move `LEFT`. If I move `DOWN` to `(4, 3)`, I am adjacent.\n        *   If I move `RIGHT` to `(5, 4)`:\n            *   Snake 1 is at `(8, 3)`.\n            *   If Snake 1 moves `LEFT` to `(7, 3)`, no overlap.\n            *   If Snake 1 moves `UP` to `(8, 4)`, no overlap.\n            *   Safe.\n\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   The bottom-left quadrant looks most favorable for a start because there are several apples close together: `(2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)`.\n        *   My current position `(4, 4)` is adjacent to `(2, 4)` (Left), `(3, 2)` (Down-Left diagonal), and `(4, 1)` (Down).\n        *   Moving `LEFT` puts me at `(3, 4)`. From there, I can reach `(2, 4)` or `(2, 3)` or `(3, 2)` easily.\n        *   Moving `DOWN` puts me at `(4, 3)`. From there, I can reach `(5, 3)` or `(4, 1)`.\n        *   Moving `LEFT` seems safer because the area to the left `(0-3, 0-4)` is relatively clear of immediate walls or the enemy. The enemy is far to the right at `(8, 3)`.\n        *   If I go `LEFT`, I open a path to the `(2, 4)` apple immediately next turn.\n        *   If I go `DOWN`, I might get contested for the `(5, 3)` apple by Snake 1 (distance 3 for him, 2 for me if I go `RIGHT`, 2 for me if I go `DOWN` + `RIGHT`). Actually, if I go `DOWN` to `(4, 3)`, I am 2 steps from `(5, 3)`. Snake 1 is 3 steps. I win that race. But `(5, 3)` is exposed to the right side.\n        *   Let's look at `(2, 4)`. It is on the board. If I move `LEFT` to `(3, 4)`, I am adjacent to `(2, 4)`. This apple is safe from Snake 1 (who is at `x=8`).\n        *   Let's look at `(4, 1)`. If I move `DOWN` to `(4, 3)`, I am 2 steps away.\n        *   Let's look at `(3, 2)`. If I move `LEFT` to `(3, 4)`, I am 2 steps away. If I move `DOWN` to `(4, 3)`, I am 2 steps away.\n        *   Let's look at `(2, 3)`. If I move `LEFT` to `(3, 4)`, I am 2 steps away. If I move `DOWN` to `(4, 3)`, I am 2 steps away.\n        *   The cluster `(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2)` is all accessible from `(3, 4)`. The apple `(4, 1)` is accessible from `(4, 3)`.\n        *   However, `LEFT` seems better because it moves away from the enemy and toward a dense cluster. `DOWN` moves toward the center but closer to the enemy's x-coordinate.\n        *   Also, checking the board map:\n            Row 3: `. . A . . A . . 1 .`\n            This shows an apple at `(2, 3)` and `(5, 3)`.\n            Row 4: `. . A . 0 . . . .`\n            This shows an apple at `(2, 4)`.\n            Row 2: `. . . A . A A . . .`\n            This shows an apple at `(3, 2)`, `(5, 2)`, `(6, 2)`.\n        *   If I move `LEFT` to `(3, 4)`:\n            *   Next turn I can go `LEFT` to `(2, 4)` (eat apple).\n            *   Or `DOWN` to `(3, 3)` (approach `(2, 3)` and `(3, 2)`).\n        *   If I move `DOWN` to `(4, 3)`:\n            *   Next turn I can go `DOWN` to `(4, 2)` (approach `(4, 1)`).\n            *   Or `RIGHT` to `(5, 3)` (eat apple). But `RIGHT` to `(5, 3)` is risky if Snake 1 moves aggressively left.\n        *   The `LEFT` move seems more robust. It opens up a safe quadrant. The `DOWN` move places me in the \"hallway\" between `(4, 1)` and `(5, 3)`, which might be harder to maneuver later.\n\n    *   **Final Check:** Is `LEFT` to `(3, 4)` safe?\n        *   Board limits: Yes.\n        *   Own body: Yes (empty).\n        *   Enemy body: Yes (Snake 1 at `(8, 3)`).\n        *   Enemy head: Snake 1 at `(8, 3)` cannot reach `(3, 4)` in one move.\n        *   Wall constraint: None.\n\n    *   **Plan:** Move `LEFT` towards the apple at `(2, 4)`. Secure the bottom-left cluster first.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the bottom-left quadrant apples ((2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)) as they are dense and relatively safe from the enemy starting at (8, 3). Avoid engaging the enemy directly until I have grown sufficiently.\n\n**Move Selection:**\nOption A: `LEFT` to `(3, 4)`.\nOption B: `DOWN` to `(4, 3)`.\nOption C: `UP` to `(4, 5)`.\nOption D: `RIGHT` to `(5, 4)`.\n\n`LEFT` allows access to (2, 4) and the dense cluster in the bottom-left.\n`DOWN` allows access to (4, 1) and (5, 3).\nThe cluster (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2) is slightly tighter than (4, 1), (5, 3), (6, 2), but (2, 4) is closer immediately.\nActually, (2, 4) is at distance 2 from start `(4, 4)` (Left-Left).\n(4, 1) is at distance 3 from start `(4, 4)` (Down-Down-Down).\n(5, 3) is at distance 2 from start `(4, 4)` (Right-Down or Down-Right).\nThe (2, 4) apple is very close. Let's grab it. Moving `LEFT` is the first step.\n\nWait, checking the board again:\nRow 4: `4 . . A . 0 . . . .`\nThe 'A' is at x=2. My head is at x=4.\nDistance is 2. Correct.\n\nLet's go `LEFT`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thought_process\": \"I am at (4, 4). The enemy is far away at (8, 3). I see a dense cluster of apples in the bottom-left quadrant: (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2). The apple at (2, 4) is only 2 steps away. Moving LEFT to (3, 4) positions me perfectly to collect (2, 4) next turn and then pivot to the other apples in that cluster. Moving DOWN to (4, 3) would target (5, 3) or (4, 1), but (5, 3) is slightly closer to the enemy, and (4, 1) is a bit further. Prioritizing (2, 4) seems the most efficient and safest start.\",\n  \"plan\": \"Move LEFT to (3, 4) to approach the apple at (2, 4).

The prompt says \"You may think out loud... You may also write a short long-term plan...\". The \"Last Rationale\" in the input was \"None\". I will just output my reasoning and the move.\n\nFinal check on move `LEFT`:\nIs `(3, 4)` empty? Yes.\nIs it safe? Yes.\nIs it good strategy? Yes, towards apple `(2, 4)`.\n\nWhat about `DOWN` to `(4, 3)`?\nThis moves towards `(4, 1)`. However, `(4, 1)` is a bit isolated compared to the `(2, 4)-(3, 2)` cluster.\nIf I go `LEFT`, I can eat `(2, 4)`, then `(2, 3)`, then `(3, 2)`.\nIf I go `DOWN`, I eat `(4, 1)` eventually, but `RIGHT` towards `(5, 3)` puts me near the enemy's potential path.\n`LEFT` is better.\n\nOne specific check: Could the enemy snake 1 move to `(3, 4)`?\nSnake 1 is at `(8, 3)`.\nDistance to `(3, 4)` is $|8-3| + |3-4| = 5+1 = 6$.\nOne turn is not enough. Safe.\n\nDecision: `LEFT`.\n\n```text\nI am at (4, 4). The enemy is at (8, 3) and poses no immediate threat.

This corresponds to:\n- Row 4: \". . 0 T . . . . . .\"\n- My head (ID 0) is at (2, 4).\n- My tail (T) is at (3, 4).\n- The body list is [(3, 4)], which matches exactly: tail at (3, 4). So the head is indeed at (2, 4). The board string for row 4 must start at x=0. Let's map the string indices to coordinates:\nRow 4: \" . . 0 T . . . . . .\"\nIndex:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\nThus:\n(0,4) = '.'\n(1,4) = '.'\n(2,4) = '0' (my head)\n(3,4) = 'T' (my tail)\n(4,4) = '.'\n... etc.\n\nMy head is at (2, 4). Body is at (3, 4). So my head is left of my tail.\n\nEnemy snake #1: head at (7, 2), body none. So enemy is at (7, 2). The board row 2 shows: \" . . . A . A A 1 . .\" Actually the string is: \" . . . A . A A 1 . .\" which maps:\n(0,2) = '.'\n(1,2) = '.'\n(2,2) = '.'\n(3,2) = 'A' (apple)\n(4,2) = '.'\n(5,2) = 'A' (apple)\n(6,2) = 'A' (apple)\n(7,2) = '1' (enemy head)\n(8,2) = '.'\n(9,2) = '.'\nSo enemy is at (7,2). No body.\n\nApples list: (4,9), (9,7), (0,8), (4,1), (6,2), (2,9), (0,0), (6,7), (2,3), (3,2), (5,3), (1,5), (4,8), (5,2), (6,0). I need to verify which of these are on the board. Let's list them:\n\n(4,9): row 9, col 4 -> board row 9: \"9 . . A . A . . . . .\" => (4,9) is 'A'? Let's parse row 9 string: \"9 . . A . A . . . . .\" The first character is '9', then spaces? Actually the representation is: \"9 . . A . A . . . . .\" Probably the board row label is \"9\" and then the cells. So cells: col 0: '.'? Wait the string after \"9\" is \" . . A . A . . . . .\". So col 0: '.', col 1: '.', col 2: 'A', col 3: '.', col 4: 'A', col 5: '.', col 6: '.', col 7: '.', col 8: '.', col 9: '.'. So (2,9) is 'A' and (4,9) is 'A'. That matches apples list: (4,9) and (2,9) are both apples. Good.\n\n(9,7): row 7: \"7 . . . . . . A . . A\" => cells: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 '.', col5 '.', col6 'A', col7 '.', col8 '.', col9 'A'. So (6,7) and (9,7) are apples. List includes (9,7) and (6,7). Good.\n\n(0,8): row 8: \"8 A . . . A . . . . .\" => cells: col0 'A', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 'A', ... So (0,8) is apple.\n\n(4,1): row 1: \"1 . . . . A . . . . .\" => cells: col4 'A'. So (4,1) is apple.\n\n(6,2): row 2: we saw col6 'A', yes.\n\n(2,9): already confirmed.\n\n(0,0): row 0: \"0 A . . . . . A . . .\" => cells: col0 'A', col6 'A'. So (0,0) and (6,0) are apples. List includes (0,0) and (6,0). Good.\n\n(2,3): row 3: \"3 . . A . . A . . . .\" => cells: col2 'A', col5 'A'. So (2,3) and (5,3) are apples. List includes both.\n\n(3,2): row 2: col3 'A', yes.\n\n(5,3): already covered.\n\n(1,5): row 5: \"5 . A . . . . . . . .\" => cells: col1 'A'. So (1,5) is apple.\n\n(4,8): row 8: col4 'A', yes.\n\n(5,2): row 2: col5 'A', yes.\n\n(6,0): row 0: col6 'A', yes.\n\nAll apples match board.\n\nNow, my head is at (2,4). Body at (3,4). Enemy head at (7,2). No other snakes.\n\nI need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFirst, evaluate immediate safety.\n\nMy head at (2,4). Possible moves:\n\n- UP: to (2,5). Check board: row 5: \"5 . A . . . . . . . .\" => (2,5) is '.' (col2). Is there any snake body? My body is only at (3,4). So (2,5) is free. Enemy body is none. So safe from collision. Also not off-board.\n\n- DOWN: to (2,3). Row 3: \"3 . . A . . A . . . .\" => (2,3) is 'A' (apple). That's fine, but is it safe? No snake bodies there. However, we must consider enemy moves. Enemy is at (7,2). Could enemy move towards (2,3)? Unlikely in one turn. But we need to consider simultaneous movement: if enemy moves UP to (7,3) or RIGHT to (8,2) or LEFT to (6,2) or DOWN to (7,1). None of those are (2,3). So down seems safe from immediate collision.\n\n- LEFT: to (1,4). Row 4: col1 is '.' (since col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '0', col3 'T'). So (1,4) is free. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: to (3,4). That's my own tail! That's moving directly into my own body. That's a death move. Actually moving into your own body (including tail) is not allowed? The rules: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So moving right to (3,4) would kill me. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n\nWe need to think about future options and apple targeting.\n\nApples nearby:\n- (2,3) is directly down, an apple. Eating it would grow me and give +1 apple.\n- (1,5) is at (1,5). That's up-left from (2,4)? Actually (1,5) is left one, up one. Could go to (1,5) via LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT.\n- (3,2) is at (3,2) - right-down from (2,4): right one, down two. But note (3,2) is an apple.\n- (4,1) is further.\n- (0,8) is far.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy's position and possible moves. Enemy at (7,2). Apples near enemy: (6,2) is apple right next to enemy (left), (5,2) is apple left of (6,2), (3,2) is apple left of that, (2,3) is apple above-left. Also (0,0) is far. Enemy likely will go for (6,2) because it's adjacent and left. If enemy goes LEFT to (6,2), that would eat apple and grow. That's plausible.\n\nBut we need to consider collision risk: if we go DOWN to (2,3) and enemy goes UP to (7,3), no collision. If we go DOWN and enemy goes LEFT to (6,2), no collision. So seems safe.\n\nBut also, we must consider that moving down to (2,3) eats an apple and grows. That's good.\n\nHowever, after eating, our head will be at (2,3) and tail will stay at (3,4) (since we didn't move the tail). Actually after eating, the snake grows: we add a new segment at the old tail position? The rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\" Typically in Snake games, when you eat, you don't remove the tail, so the tail stays, and the body length increases. So after moving to (2,3), the new head is (2,3), body includes (2,4) and (3,4) (since (2,4) becomes body). Actually careful: current body is [(3,4)] (tail). After moving to (2,3), the new body becomes: [(2,4), (3,4)]? Wait the snake's body: head at (2,4) moves to (2,3). The previous head becomes part of body. The tail (3,4) remains unless we eat. Since we eat, we grow, so tail does not move. So new body: [ (2,4), (3,4) ]. So length becomes 3.\n\nNow, from (2,3), where can we go next? Options: UP to (2,4) (that's our own body! That would be moving backwards into our own body? Actually moving from (2,3) to (2,4) is moving into the cell that is now our own body (the previous head). That's prohibited: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" That's exactly moving into the cell behind your head. So UP would be death. So after eating at (2,3), we must avoid moving back to (2,4). So we need to consider that. Also we could go LEFT to (1,3), DOWN to (2,2), RIGHT to (3,3). Are those safe? (1,3) is '.'? Row 3: col1 '.' (since \"3 . . A . . A . . . .\" -> col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 'A', col3 '.', ...). So (1,3) is free. (2,2) is '.'? Row 2: col2 '.' (since \" . . . A . A A 1 . .\" -> col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 'A'...). So (2,2) free. (3,3) is '.'? Row 3 col3 '.' (since col3 '.'). So (3,3) free.\n\nBut we also need to consider enemy movements.\n\nIf we go DOWN now, we eat (2,3). Then next turn, enemy might be at (6,2) if it ate left, or elsewhere.\n\nBut maybe we can consider other moves that lead to more apples.\n\nAlternatively, UP to (2,5). From (2,5), what apples are nearby? (1,5) is apple at (1,5). That's adjacent left. Also (2,5) is not an apple. (2,5) is empty. From (2,5), we could go LEFT to (1,5) and eat apple. Or UP to (2,6) etc.\n\nLEFT to (1,4) is empty, from there we could go UP to (1,5) (apple) or LEFT to (0,4) or DOWN to (1,3) or RIGHT back to (2,4) (which would be into our body). So LEFT gives access to (1,5) apple.\n\nDOWN to (2,3) gives immediate apple, but restricts future moves (cannot go UP). That's okay as long as we have other exits.\n\nRIGHT is death.\n\nNow, we should also consider the enemy's potential to collide with us. Since we move simultaneously, if we move to a cell that the enemy also moves into, we both die. That's a head-on collision. So we need to think about where enemy might move.\n\nEnemy at (7,2). Possible moves: UP (7,3), DOWN (7,1), LEFT (6,2), RIGHT (8,2). Among these, LEFT (6,2) is an apple, so enemy is likely to go LEFT to eat. But not guaranteed; enemy might have a different strategy. However, based on typical snake behavior, eating apples is prioritized.\n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (6,2), we are not moving there. So no collision.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (2,3), enemy moving to (6,2) is far away.\n\nIf we go UP to (2,5), enemy moving to (6,2) is fine.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (1,4), enemy moving to (6,2) is fine.\n\nBut we must also consider that enemy might move in a way that cuts us off later.\n\nWe should also consider board boundaries and trap avoidance.\n\nOur current position is near the left side. We have an apple at (0,0) bottom left, but that's far and may lead to trap.\n\nLet's evaluate each move's future potential.\n\nOption 1: DOWN to (2,3) - eat apple.\n\nPros:\n- Immediate point and growth.\n- Opens up left side (1,3) and down (2,2) and right (3,3). (2,2) is near apples (3,2) and (5,2) etc.\n- After eating, we can move to (1,3) or (2,2) or (3,3). (1,3) leads to (0,3) or (1,2) etc.\n- (3,3) leads towards (3,2) apple.\n- (2,2) leads towards (2,1) but row1 col2 is '.'? Actually row1 col2 is '.'? row1: \"1 . . . . A . . . . .\" -> col2 '.'.\n- Also (2,2) is adjacent to (3,2) apple (right) and (2,3) which is now our body.\n\nCons:\n- After eating, we cannot go UP (back to (2,4)), which is a restriction but still have three other directions (left, down, right). So still mobile.\n- Might trap ourselves if we go too deep into corner. (2,3) is not corner; we have access to (1,3) and (0,3) and (0,2) etc.\n\nOption 2: UP to (2,5).\n\nPros:\n- Moves towards central area.\n- From (2,5), we can go LEFT to (1,5) apple, or UP to (2,6), or RIGHT to (3,5), or DOWN back to (2,4) (into body). So again three directions.\n- (1,5) apple is adjacent, so we could eat next turn.\n- Also (2,5) is not an apple, but positions us to collect multiple apples in the upper left region: (0,8), (2,9), (4,9), (4,8), etc.\n\nCons:\n- Might be moving away from some nearby apples: (2,3) is down, (3,2) is down-right, (1,5) is left, but we can still get (1,5) from (2,5) by going left.\n- Enemy is far away.\n\nOption 3: LEFT to (1,4).\n\nPros:\n- Moves leftwards, closer to (0,4) and (0,3), (0,2), (0,0) apple.\n- From (1,4), we can go UP to (1,5) apple, LEFT to (0,4), DOWN to (1,3), or RIGHT back to (2,4) (into body). So three directions.\n- (1,5) apple is one move away.\n- Also (0,8) apple is reachable via up-left.\n\nCons:\n- Might trap in left edge. But (1,4) is not corner; we have space.\n\nNow, we also need to consider the enemy's potential to head towards us? Not likely, as we are far apart.\n\nBut we should also think about the long-term plan: we want to outlast the enemy and reach 30 apples. That's far off, but we should avoid getting trapped and keep options open.\n\nGiven that it's only turn 2, we should prioritize safe growth and positioning.\n\nThe apple at (2,3) is immediately reachable. If we don't take it now, enemy might later come near, but not likely. However, we might lose it to the enemy? Enemy is far away, so not an issue. But we can take it now.\n\nAlso, note that the apple at (2,3) is directly below us. If we move down, we eat it. That's efficient.\n\nBut let's consider the immediate safety of each move with respect to enemy movement.\n\nEnemy at (7,2). If enemy moves UP to (7,3), no collision with us. If enemy moves LEFT to (6,2), no collision. If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,2), no collision. If enemy moves DOWN to (7,1), no collision.\n\nBut also, we need to consider if the enemy might move into our path? Unlikely.\n\nNow, what about our own body? After moving, our body will shift. If we move DOWN to (2,3), our body becomes [(2,4), (3,4)]. If we move UP to (2,5), body becomes [(2,4), (3,4)]. If we move LEFT to (1,4), body becomes [(2,4), (3,4)]. In all cases, our body includes (2,4) and (3,4). So from any new head position, moving back to (2,4) would be death.\n\nNow, let's think about future moves after each option.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (2,3):\nNext turn, we are at (2,3). Our body: (2,4) and (3,4). Safe moves: LEFT (1,3), DOWN (2,2), RIGHT (3,3). UP is death. So we have three safe moves. That's still good.\n\nFrom (2,3), the nearest apple is (3,2) (down-right), (1,3) is empty, (2,2) is empty, (3,3) is empty. (1,5) is two moves away. (0,0) is far.\n\nIf we move UP to (2,5):\nNext turn, head (2,5), body (2,4), (3,4). Safe moves: LEFT (1,5) [apple], UP (2,6), RIGHT (3,5), DOWN (2,4) [death]. So three safe moves, with an apple adjacent left.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (1,4):\nNext turn, head (1,4), body (2,4), (3,4). Safe moves: UP (1,5) [apple], LEFT (0,4), DOWN (1,3), RIGHT (2,4) [death]. So three safe moves, with apple adjacent up.\n\nAll options give three safe moves next turn. So all are decent.\n\nNow, consider which option leads to more apples in the near future.\n\nOption DOWN: immediate apple (2,3). Next turn, we could go LEFT to (1,3) (empty), DOWN to (2,2) (empty), RIGHT to (3,3) (empty). To get another apple, we might need to go RIGHT to (3,3) then DOWN to (3,2) (apple). That's two moves from now (current turn: down to (2,3); next turn: right to (3,3); following turn: down to (3,2)). Or from (2,3), LEFT to (1,3), then UP to (1,4) (back to our previous position), then LEFT to (0,4) etc. Not immediate.\n\nOption UP: no immediate apple, but next turn can go LEFT to (1,5) and eat apple. So from current, two moves to eat an apple (up, then left). That's similar timing.\n\nOption LEFT: no immediate apple, but next turn can go UP to (1,5) and eat apple. So also two moves to eat.\n\nThus DOWN gives immediate reward.\n\nNow, consider the risk of collisions with enemy after multiple turns. Since enemy is far, not a big concern.\n\nHowever, we should also consider the possibility that enemy might move towards our area later. But unlikely in early turns.\n\nAnother factor: the board is 10x10. We are on the left side. There are many apples on the left side: (0,0), (0,8), (2,3), (1,5), (2,9), (4,8), (4,9), (4,1), (6,2), (6,0), (6,7), (9,7), etc. Actually many apples are on the right side too. But left side has several.\n\nIf we move down to (2,3), we are heading towards the lower left quadrant where apples are (2,3) just eaten, (3,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,0), (0,0). That's a cluster. However, note that (6,2) is near enemy, so might be contested. But we can go for (3,2) and (5,2) etc.\n\nIf we move up or left, we go towards upper left apples: (0,8), (2,9), (4,8), (4,9), (1,5). That's also good.\n\nWhich cluster is more dense? Let's count apples in lower left vs upper left.\n\nLower left (y<=4, x<=6): apples at (2,3) [if we eat], (3,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,0), (0,0), (4,1). That's 6 apples plus (2,3) eaten. So 5 remaining after eating. Also (2,9) etc are far.\n\nUpper left (y>=5, x<=6): apples at (1,5), (0,8), (2,9), (4,8), (4,9). That's 5 apples.\n\nBut note there is also (6,7) and (9,7) on upper right. And (5,3) is mid.\n\nBut for now, we should focus on immediate.\n\nAlso consider that moving down to (2,3) might lead us towards the corner (0,0) but that's far. From (2,3), we can go left to (1,3) then down to (1,2) etc. But we need to avoid getting trapped in the corner. However, with a longer snake, it's easier to get trapped in corners. Since our snake is still short (length 2), we have flexibility.\n\nNow, let's think about enemy's potential growth. If enemy eats (6,2) or (5,2) or (3,2), they will grow. We need to compete. If we go down, we might be closer to (3,2) and (5,2). However, enemy is closer to (6,2) and (5,2) because they are at (7,2). So enemy can reach (6,2) in one move (left). So (6,2) is likely taken by enemy soon. (5,2) is two moves away for enemy (left-left). We are at (2,4); to reach (5,2) we need at least three moves: down to (2,3), right to (3,3), right to (4,3), down to (4,2) then right to (5,2) \u2014 that's many. Or alternative path. So enemy may get (5,2) before us.\n\nBut we have (3,2) which is closer: from (2,4) we can go down to (2,3) then right to (3,3) then down to (3,2) \u2014 three moves. Actually from (2,4) to (3,2) is two moves: right to (3,4) is death (own body), so not that. So need down then right then down. That's three moves. Enemy from (7,2) to (3,2) is four moves left. So we are closer to (3,2).\n\nBut also we have (2,3) now.\n\nIf we go up to (2,5), we are closer to (1,5) and (0,8) etc. Enemy is far.\n\nGiven the immediate availability of an apple at (2,3), and it's safe, I think moving DOWN is a good choice.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that moving DOWN does not cause a head-on collision with enemy. Enemy moves simultaneously. Could enemy move to (2,3)? No, enemy is at (7,2), cannot reach (2,3) in one move.\n\nThus DOWN is safe.\n\nAlso, we must consider if any other snake might move into our new head position? Only enemy.\n\nSo DOWN is safe.\n\nNow, what about moving UP? That's also safe, but no immediate reward. LEFT also safe.\n\nGiven the rules: \"Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both: * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and * keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\"\n\nDOWN gives immediate apple and keeps three future options. So it increases chance of safely eating apples (immediate) and still keeps options open.\n\nBut is there a risk of getting trapped? From (2,3), we have three directions: left, down, right. Up is blocked by own body. That's not too bad; we still have three options. In contrast, from (2,5) or (1,4) we also have three options. So all similar.\n\nHowever, from (2,3), we are one step closer to the bottom edge. If we go down to (2,2) next, we might be even closer to bottom. But we can also go left. So not a big issue.\n\nNow, we should also consider that the enemy might be moving left to eat (6,2). That could cause them to grow. If we don't grow, we fall behind. So eating now helps keep up.\n\nThus, I think DOWN is the best move.\n\nBut let's double-check the board state to ensure no hidden dangers.\n\nMy head at (2,4). Body at (3,4). That means the cell to my right (3,4) is my tail. Moving right would be death, as we said.\n\nNow, moving down to (2,3): is there any apple there? Yes, apple at (2,3). So we will eat it and grow.\n\nNow, after moving down, our new head is (2,3). Our body: previous head (2,4) and tail (3,4). So body occupies (2,4) and (3,4). Are there any apples at (2,4) or (3,4)? No. (2,4) is '.' originally, (3,4) is tail originally. No apples there.\n\nNow, what about enemy? Enemy at (7,2). If enemy moves UP to (7,3), that's fine. If enemy moves LEFT to (6,2), they eat apple and grow. If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,2), that's empty. If enemy moves DOWN to (7,1), empty.\n\nNone of these intersect with our new head or body.\n\nBut also consider that enemy might move into our body? Enemy head moving into our body (2,4) or (3,4) would cause enemy to die. That's good for us. But unlikely.\n\nNow, we need to output the move as a single word.\n\nThus, I'll choose DOWN.\n\nBut wait: is there any possibility that moving DOWN is dangerous because enemy might move into (2,3) if they have some long-range prediction? No, impossible in one turn.\n\nThus, I'll go with DOWN.\n\nI'll write a rationale for future self: \"I chose to move DOWN to (2,3) to immediately eat the apple at (2,3), growing my snake. This gives me a point and opens up future moves: from (2,3) I can go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT to continue collecting apples in the lower left region. The enemy is far away and poses no immediate threat. My next goal is to target the apple at (3,2) or (1,5).\"\n\nBut the instructions say: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I should include a plan before the final move.\n\nThus, my response should have:\n\n- Some reasoning/plan.\n- Then the final line: DOWN\n\nBut the final line must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. No extra characters after that word.\n\nSo I'll write something like:\n\n\"Turning down to (2,3) to eat the apple immediately. This grows my snake and positions me to collect more apples in the lower left cluster. Next turn, I'll consider moving towards (3,2) or (1,5) based on enemy movements. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\"\n\nThen the final line: DOWN\n\nBut ensure that the final line is exactly \"DOWN\" and nothing else. Also, the plan should be concise.\n\nLet's craft the responseTurning down to (2,3) to eat the apple immediately. This grows my snake and positions me to collect more apples in the lower left cluster. Next turn, I'll consider moving towards (3,2) or (1,5) based on enemy movements. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nDOWN",

No, if I eat, tail stays, head moves, body shifts).\nLet's trace body:\nCurrent: Head (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4).\nMove RIGHT to (3,2).\nNew Head: (3,2).\nNew Body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\nWait, the apple at (3,2) is there.\nIf I eat it, I grow. The tail (2,4) stays for one turn.\nSo new body becomes: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,4) ? No.\nStandard snake logic: Head moves to new pos. Old head becomes first body segment.\nIf eating: Tail does not move.\nCurrent Body indices: 0: Head (2,2), 1: (2,3), 2: (2,4).\nNew Head: (3,2).\nNew Body: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] + [Apple] -> Length 4.\nLet's check collision with self.\nNew Head (3,2) must not be in New Body.\nNew Body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n(3,2) is not in there. Safe.\n\nCheck collision with enemy.\nIf Enemy moves to (3,2)? Unlikely. Enemy is at (5,2).\nIf Enemy moves LEFT (4,2).\nIf Enemy moves UP (5,3).\nIf Enemy moves DOWN (5,1).\nEnemy cannot reach (3,2) in one turn.\nCan Enemy head move into my body?\nIf I am at (3,2), my body occupies (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\nIf Enemy moves to (2,2): Enemy is at (5,2). Manhattan distance to (2,2) is 3. Cannot reach in 1 turn.\nIf Enemy moves to (2,3): Distance 4. Cannot.\nIf Enemy moves to (2,4): Distance 5. Cannot.\nSo moving RIGHT to (3,2) is safe from enemy collision.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3,2)? It is there. I will eat it.\nEating it gives me +1 apple.\nMy score becomes 3.\nEnemy score is 2.\nI increase my lead.\n\nAre there other apples?\n(4,1) is close.\n(2,9) is far.\n(1,5) is close.\n\nLet's look at the board state again to see if moving RIGHT traps me.\nPosition (3,2).\nNeighbors:\n- UP (3,3): Empty.\n- DOWN (3,1): Empty.\n- LEFT (2,2): Will be occupied by my body (old head) next turn.\n- RIGHT (4,2): Empty (unless Enemy moves there).\n\nIf I am at (3,2) next turn:\nMy body is at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\nI can move UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), or RIGHT to (4,2).\nI cannot move LEFT (backwards into body).\nSo I have 3 options. That is good flexibility.\n\nCompare with moving DOWN to (2,1):\nHead (2,1).\nNeighbors:\n- UP (2,2): Occupied by body.\n- DOWN (2,0): Apple at (6,0) is far, but (2,0) is empty. However (2,0) is cornerish.\n- LEFT (1,1): Empty.\n- RIGHT (3,1): Empty.\nOptions: 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\nApples nearby: (4,1) is at distance 3 (via RIGHT, RIGHT, UP? Or RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN? No, (4,1) is at x=4, y=1. From (2,1): RIGHT to (3,1), RIGHT to (4,1). Distance 2.\nFrom (3,2): RIGHT to (4,2), DOWN to (4,1). Distance 2.\nFrom (3,2): LEFT to (2,2), DOWN to (2,1), LEFT to (1,1), DOWN to (1,0). No apples immediately.\nFrom (2,1): RIGHT to (3,1), RIGHT to (4,1) (Apple). Distance 2.\n\nLet's compare the moves:\n1.  **RIGHT to (3,2)**:\n    *   Immediate apple gain (+1 score).\n    *   Reachable apples next turn: (4,1) via RIGHT/DOWN.\n    *   Future options: (3,3), (3,1), (4,2).\n2.  **DOWN to (2,1)**:\n    *   No immediate apple.\n    *   Reachable apples next turn: (4,1) via RIGHT/RIGHT.\n    *   Future options: (2,0), (1,1), (3,1).\n3.  **LEFT to (1,2)**:\n    *   No immediate apple.\n    *   Reachable apples: (1,5) is far. (0,0) is far.\n    *   Future options: (1,3), (1,1), (0,2).\n\nThe apple at (3,2) is the \"low hanging fruit\". Taking it secures a point and increases length (length 4), which is generally better for survival (more body to block enemies, though here it's mostly about score).\nAlso, I am currently tied 2-2. Taking the apple puts me ahead 3-2.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to take (3,2)?\nIf the enemy moves to (3,2)?\nEnemy is at (5,2).\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (4,2).\nIf Enemy moves UP to (5,3).\nEnemy CANNOT reach (3,2) in one turn.\nIs it possible for Enemy to kill me by moving into my body?\nIf I am at (3,2), my body is at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\nEnemy is at (5,2).\nEnemy moves to (4,2).\n(4,2) is not my body.\nEnemy moves to (5,1). Not my body.\nEnemy moves to (5,3). Not my body.\nSo I am safe.\n\nIs there a risk of head-on collision?\nEnemy at (5,2) -> (4,2).\nMe at (2,2) -> (3,2).\nNo collision.\n\nWhat if I move RIGHT and Enemy moves... nowhere dangerous.\nI will be at (3,2).\nNext turn I will have options.\nLet's think long term.\nI am at (3,2). Next turn I might move to (4,2) or (4,1) or (3,3).\n(4,1) is an apple.\nIf I go to (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,1).\nOr (3,2) -> (4,1) directly? No, diagonal not allowed.\n(3,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,1).\n(3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1).\nThe apple at (4,1) is very accessible.\nAlso, there is an apple at (6,0). But that's further.\n\nLet's double check the board for traps.\nIf I go to (3,2), I am moving right. My tail is at (2,4).\nThe area around (3,2) is open.\n\nIs there any reason to fear the enemy?\nEnemy head at (5,2).\nIf enemy moves UP to (5,3) (which has an apple), they grow.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (5,1), they are safe.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (4,2), they are safe.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (6,2), they die (hits own body).\nSo enemy will likely move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (4,2):\nI am at (3,2). My body is at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\nIf next turn I move RIGHT to (4,2), I will be moving into the cell enemy just left? No.\nIf I am at (3,2) and enemy is at (4,2).\nMy next move options are (3,3), (3,1), (4,2).\nIf I move to (4,2), I hit the enemy head.\nSo I must avoid that.\nBut that is a future decision.\nFor THIS turn, moving to (3,2) is safe.\n\nIs there a better move?\nWhat about moving DOWN to (2,1)?\n(2,1) is safe. (2,0) is an apple? No, (2,0) is empty. Apples are at (6,0), (0,0).\n(4,1) is an apple.\nFrom (2,1), I can go to (3,1) -> (4,1).\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (4,2) -> (4,1) or (3,1) -> (4,1).\nDistance to (4,1) is 2 steps either way.\nHowever, by moving to (3,2) now, I get an apple immediately (3,2).\nBy moving to (2,1) now, I get no apple immediately.\nAlso, (3,2) is closer to the center than (2,1), offering more flexibility usually.\n(2,1) is closer to the left wall.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the threat of the enemy.\nEnemy is at (5,2).\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,2), the distance between me and enemy is 2 (from x=3 to x=5).\nIf I move DOWN to (2,1), distance is sqrt((5-2)^2 + (2-1)^2) = sqrt(9+1) = ~3.16.\nThe difference in distance is minimal.\nHowever, the immediate score increase is significant.\nBeing ahead in score is good.\n\nIs there any collision risk I missed?\nMy move: (2,2) -> (3,2).\nMy body moves: (2,3) -> (2,2), (2,4) -> (2,3).\nNew positions:\nHead: (3,2)\nBody: (2,2), (2,3)\nTail: (2,4) (stays if I eat apple at (3,2)).\nWait, if I eat the apple at (3,2), I grow.\nNew body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\nIs (3,2) in {(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)}? No.\nIs (3,2) in {(6,2), (7,2)} (enemy body)? No.\nIs (3,2) where enemy head will be?\nEnemy moves from (5,2). Possible destinations: (5,3), (5,1), (4,2), (6,2).\nNone of these are (3,2).\nSo collision is impossible.\n\nOne detail: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nMy current head is (2,2). My body follows at (2,3).\nMoving DOWN to (2,1) is not backwards.\nMoving UP to (2,3) would be backwards (into body).\nMoving RIGHT to (3,2) is not backwards.\nMoving LEFT to (1,2) is not backwards.\nSo \"backwards\" logic doesn't eliminate any valid moves except UP (which is already eliminated by body collision).\n\nSo, RIGHT to (3,2) seems the best move. It gains a point immediately and sets me up well.\n\nOne check: Is (3,2) a trap?\nSurrounding cells: (3,3), (3,1), (4,2), (2,2).\n(2,2) will be my body.\n(3,3) is empty.\n(3,1) is empty.\n(4,2) is empty (unless enemy moves there, but then I can just go to (3,1) or (3,3) next turn).\nIt's not a trap.\n\nFinal check on enemy moves.\nIf enemy moves to (4,2).\nI am at (3,2).\nIf I decide to move RIGHT to (4,2) next turn, I die. But I can move UP or DOWN.\nIf I am at (3,2) and enemy is at (4,2), I am safe this turn.\nNext turn, I have (3,3) and (3,1) open.\nIf enemy is at (4,2) and moves to (4,1) or (4,3) or (5,2) or (3,2).\nIf enemy moves to (3,2) (my head), I die.\nBut I can move away before that.\nWait, movement is simultaneous.\nIf I am at (3,2) and Enemy is at (4,2).\nNext turn:\nI move from (3,2) -> (3,3).\nEnemy moves from (4,2) -> (3,2).\nSimultaneous.\nMy head ends at (3,3). Enemy head ends at (3,2).\nNo collision.\nSo even if enemy \"chases\" me, I am safe as long as I don't run into them.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is the best move.\n\nLong-term plan note:\nMove RIGHT to (3,2) to eat the apple and take the lead. From there, plan to move towards the apple at (4,1) while keeping the enemy at a safe distance. Avoid getting boxed in by the enemy or my own tail.\n\nMove: RIGHTI will move RIGHT to (3,2). This move allows me to immediately eat the apple located there, increasing my score to 3 and breaking the tie with the enemy. The move is safe: (3,2) is currently empty, not occupied by my own body or the enemy, and staying within the board boundaries. Moving here also positions me to easily access the apple at (4,1) on the next turn. The enemy snake at (5,2) cannot reach me or collide with me this turn regardless of their move choice.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "**Current Situation Analysis (Turn 6/150):**\n- **My Head:** (4, 2)\n- **My Body:** [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)] (Wait, the prompt says Body: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)], Head: (4, 2). This implies the body segments are to the left of the head. However, the board state shows `(2, 3)` is to the left of `(2, 2)`? No, `(2, 3)` is above `(2, 2)`. The list order matters for movement (shifting), but for collision, we look at coordinates. The tail is currently at `(2, 3)` based on the list order? No, the list order is Head-to-Tail. So Head is (4, 2). The next segment is (3, 2). Then (2, 2). Then (2, 3). Wait, (2, 2) connects to (2, 3)? That implies a left turn or a loop. Let's look at the board state visualization.\n    `9 . . A . A . . . . .`\n    `8 . . . . A A A . . .`\n    `7 . . . . . . A . . A`\n    `6 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    `5 . A . . . . . . A .`\n    `4 . . . . A 1 . . . .`\n    `3 . . T . . T . . . .`\n    `2 . . T T 0 T T . . .`  (Wait, the board shows `0` at (2,2)? No, the board shows `T` at (2,2) and `0` at (4,2). Let's re-read the board carefully.\n    Row 2: `.` `.` `T` `T` `0` `T` `T` `.` `.` `.`\n    Columns: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\n    So at (4,2) is the head '0'. At (3,2) is 'T' (tail/body). At (2,2) is 'T'. At (5,2) is 'T' (Snake #1). At (6,2) is 'T' (Snake #1).\n    Row 3: `.` `.` `T` `.` `.` `T` `.` `.` `.` `.`\n    At (2,3) is 'T'. At (5,3) is 'T' (Snake #1 body or head? Snake #1 head is (5,4) currently).\n    Let's map my body: `(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)`.\n    - (3,2) is adjacent to head (4,2). Correct.\n    - (2,2) is adjacent to (3,2). Correct.\n    - (2,3) is adjacent to (2,2). Correct.\n    So my body is a right-angle shape to the left of the head.\n- **Enemy:** Snake #1 is at `(5, 4)` with body `(5, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2)`. They are to my right.\n- **Apples:** Many apples available. Closest is `(4, 4)` (2 units up). `(4, 1)` is 1 unit down. `(3, 1)` is nearby.\n\n**Move Evaluation (Current: Head (4,2)):**\n1.  **UP (4, 3):**\n    - Board state at (4,3) is `.` (Row 3, Col 4).\n    - Is it safe? Yes, empty.\n    - Is it a trap? Moving to (4,3) puts me in line with the apple at (4,4). Enemy is at (5,4). If I go UP to (4,3), and Enemy goes LEFT to (4,4) to eat the apple, we have a head-on collision? No, if Enemy moves to (4,4) and I move to (4,3), we don't collide. If Enemy moves to (4,3) (unlikely, they are at (5,4), they would have to go LEFT twice to hit me), or I move to (4,4) next turn and they move to (4,4) same time? We must simulate.\n    - Current Enemy Head: (5,4). Apples near them: (5,5)? No. (4,4) is very close. They will likely try for (4,4).\n    - If I go UP to (4,3), I am threatening the apple at (4,4) next turn.\n    - If Enemy goes LEFT to (4,4) this turn (to eat the apple), and I go UP to (4,3), no collision. Next turn, I can't go to (4,4) because Enemy is there (or eating it). I would have to go around.\n    - If I stay at (4,2), Enemy might go LEFT to (4,4). Then I am safe at (4,2).\n    - If I go UP, I am closer to the apple. But is (4,3) a dangerous position? It's directly below the apple (4,4) and to the left of Enemy (5,4).\n    - Let's check if (4,3) is a dead end later? No, (4,3) connects to (4,4), (5,3), (3,3), (4,2).\n    - (3,3) is empty. (5,3) is Enemy body. (4,2) is my body (current head location, will be body next turn). (4,4) is apple.\n    - If I go UP to (4,3), next turn my tail moves from (2,3) to (2,2)? No, tail moves from (2,3) to (2,2)? Wait, body is `(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)`. Last is (2,3). So tail is (2,3).\n    - If I move UP, new body becomes `(4,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)`. Tail remains (2,3) (assuming no apple eaten).\n    - (2,3) is safe.\n    - The only risk is the Enemy.\n\n2.  **DOWN (4, 1):**\n    - Board state at (4,1) is `A` (Apple).\n    - Eating an apple is good. I grow.\n    - Is it safe? Yes.\n    - Where is the Enemy? (5,4). They are far.\n    - If I eat (4,1), I grow. My tail (2,3) might not move if I eat? In standard Snake, if you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So new body: `(4,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)`. Wait, if I eat, I add a segment, so the tail (2,3) stays, and (2,2) stays, and (3,2) stays. So new body is `(4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)`? No, the previous head (4,2) becomes the first body segment.\n    - Let's trace carefully. Current Head (4,2). Body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n    - Move DOWN to (4,1). Eat apple.\n    - New Head: (4,1).\n    - New Body: (4,2) (old head), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3) (old tail retained because we grew).\n    - Is (4,1) safe? Yes.\n    - Is (4,2) safe? It's empty (I just left it).\n    - Is (3,2) safe? Yes.\n    - Is (2,2) safe? Yes.\n    - Is (2,3) safe? Yes.\n    - Are there any threats? Snake #1 is at (5,4). They might move DOWN to (5,3) or (5,2), but they are far from (4,1).\n    - This seems very safe. We gain a point.\n\n3.  **LEFT (3, 2):**\n    - Board state at (3,2) is `T` (my body).\n    - Collision with self. Immediate death.\n    - Invalid.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 2):**\n    - Board state at (5,2) is `T` (Snake #1 body).\n    - Collision with enemy body. Immediate death.\n    - Invalid.\n\n**Comparing UP vs DOWN:**\n- **DOWN (4, 1):** Eats an apple. Grows. Very safe. No immediate threats. Gives me more length (potential survival later). Opens up the bottom left area (0,0) is an apple, (3,1) is empty, (1,5) is an apple but far).\n- **UP (4, 3):** Moves closer to apple at (4,4). But places me directly below (4,4) and to the left of Enemy (5,4).\n    - Risk: Enemy at (5,4) might move LEFT to (4,4). If they do, they eat the apple. If I am at (4,3), I am safe from collision this turn. However, next turn, I might be trapped.\n    - If Enemy goes LEFT to (4,4), I am at (4,3). My options:\n        - UP to (4,4)? Occupied by Enemy (dead).\n        - LEFT to (3,3)? Empty.\n        - RIGHT to (5,3)? Enemy body (dead).\n        - DOWN to (4,2)? My body (dead, unless tail moved).\n    - Wait, if Enemy moves to (4,4), they eat the apple (assuming it's there). The prompt says Apples at: (4, 9)... (4, 4)... (3, 1)...\n    - If Enemy eats (4,4), it grows. Its tail moves. Its body is currently `(5,3), (5,2), (6,2)`.\n    - If Enemy moves LEFT to (4,4):\n        - New Head: (4,4).\n        - New Body: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2) (since it ate).\n        - If I am at (4,3), I am safe this turn.\n        - Next turn (Turn 7), I am at (4,3). My body is `(4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)` (if I didn't eat).\n        - Enemy is at (4,4). My options from (4,3):\n            - UP (4,4): Enemy is there. Collision. Death.\n            - DOWN (4,2): My body is there. Death.\n            - LEFT (3,3): Safe?\n            - RIGHT (5,3): Enemy body is there. Death.\n        - So if Enemy takes (4,4), I am forced to go LEFT to (3,3). If (3,3) is safe, I survive.\n        - (3,3) is empty.\n        - If I go LEFT to (3,3), I am safe.\n        - So UP is not immediately fatal, but it forces me into a corner if Enemy takes the apple.\n- **DOWN (4, 1):** Eats an apple. Secures points. Avoids conflict with Enemy who is hunting the (4,4) apple.\n    - If I go DOWN, I am at (4,1). Enemy is likely going for (4,4).\n    - From (4,1), I can go to (3,1) (apple), (2,1) (empty), (5,1) (empty), or back UP to (4,2).\n    - This seems much more flexible and less risky.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDOWN is the best move. It eats an apple, grows my snake, and moves me away from the potential conflict zone at (4,4). The enemy snake is likely to move towards (4,4) or elsewhere, but moving down puts distance between us and secures immediate value.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nPrioritize safe apple acquisition. The enemy is engaged in a high-traffic area (top right/middle). I will focus on the bottom and left side of the board where there are apples at (0,0), (3,1), (1,5), etc. Avoid direct confrontation unless necessary.\n\n**Move Selection:**\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**Turn 7/150 Strategy:**\n\nI am currently at `(4, 1)` after eating an apple on the previous turn. My body is now `(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)`. The enemy snake is at `(4, 4)`, having likely just eaten the apple there. We are effectively mirroring each other on the vertical axis (I am at x=4, they are at x=4). However, my immediate environment is safer.\n\n**Current Position Analysis (Head at `(4, 1)`):**\n*   **Up `(4, 2)`**: Occupied by my own body (old head). **DEADLY**.\n*   **Down `(4, 0)`**: This is within the board boundaries (0,0). Checking the board state: Row 0, Col 4 is `.` (empty). However, there is an apple at `(0, 0)` and `(6, 0)`, so `(4, 0)` is safe empty space.\n*   **Left `(3, 1)`**: This is an apple `(3, 1)` according to the list. Checking board state: Row 1, Col 3 is `A`. **Safe & Eating**.\n*   **Right `(5, 1)`**: This is an apple `(5, 1)` according to the list. Checking board state: Row 1, Col 5 is `A`. **Safe & Eating**.\n\n**Decision:**\nI have two excellent options: `LEFT` to `(3, 1)` or `RIGHT` to `(5, 1)`. Both are apples and safe.\n\n**Long-term Analysis:**\n*   **Enemy Position**: Snake #1 is at `(4, 4)`. Their potential moves are likely to secure food or maneuver. They are currently occupying the vertical line `x=4`.\n*   **Avoiding Enemy**: If I stay at `x=4` (moving Down), I remain on the same vertical axis as the enemy. While `(4, 0)` is safe now, it creates a potential future conflict corridor if the enemy decides to descend towards the bottom. To outwit the enemy and avoid being trapped, I should clear the vertical line `x=4` and move to the sides.\n*   **Option LEFT vs RIGHT**:\n    *   **Right `(5, 1)`**: Moves towards the right side of the board. This leads toward `(6, 0)` apple, `(6, 7)` apple, `(8, 5)` etc. The right side is crowded with apples.\n    *   **Left `(3, 1)`**: Moves towards the left side. This leads toward `(0, 0)` apple, `(0, 5)`, `(2, 9)`.\n*   **Current State**: The enemy is at `x=4`. Moving to `x=3` (Left) or `x=5` (Right) are both moves away from the enemy. However, moving to `x=3` puts me closer to the left wall (x=0) and the top-left quadrant, which seems slightly less contested immediately by the enemy compared to the middle/right. Also, `(3, 1)` is adjacent to `(3, 2)` which is currently my body (the segment immediately following my head). Wait, looking at my body: `(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)`. The segment at `(3, 2)` is my second body segment. If I move to `(3, 1)`, I am not colliding with `(3, 2)` (that's diagonal). My path is clear.\n\n**Refined Decision:**\nChoosing **LEFT**.\n1.  **Safety**: It's an apple. The path is clear.\n2.  **Avoidance**: It moves me away from the enemy's likely path (who is at x=4).\n3.  **Routing**: It positions me to explore the bottom-left area (apples at 0,0 and 1,5).\n\n**Move Selection:**\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

Yes. Self? No. Enemy Body? No.\n    -   Enemy Prediction: Enemy is at (4, 5). Likely moves towards nearby apples like (4, 8) or (5, 8). Unlikely to reach (3, 0) immediately.\n    -   Safety: **Safe**.\n    -   Value: No apple immediately.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):**\n    -   Coordinates: (2, 1).\n    -   Board State: Row 1, Col 2 is `T` (My Body).\n    -   Result: **DEAD** (Collision with self).\n    -   Ruled out.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):**\n    -   Coordinates: (4, 1).\n    -   Board State: Row 1, Col 4 is `T` (My Body).\n    -   Result: **DEAD** (Collision with self).\n    -   Ruled out.\n\n**Strategy & Deduction:**\nAt first glance, all moves seem illegal because they all lead to a cell currently occupied by my body. This suggests I am trapped in a small pocket of space. However, snakes move simultaneously. My body moves with me.\n\nLet's trace the movement dynamics for **DOWN to (3, 0)**:\n-   **My Head:** Moves from (3, 1) to (3, 0).\n-   **My Body:** The body follows the head. My current body is `[(4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)]`. The segment `(4, 1)` moves to my current head `(3, 1)`. The next segments shift forward.\n-   **Collision Check:**\n    -   **New Head (3, 0)** vs **New Body**:\n        -   (3, 0) vs (3, 1): Different.\n        -   (3, 0) vs (4, 2): Different.\n        -   (3, 0) vs (3, 2): Different.\n        -   (3, 0) vs (2, 2): Different.\n        -   (3, 0) vs (2, 3): Different.\n    -   **Enemy:** The enemy is at `(4, 5)`. To collide with my new head (3, 0), the enemy would need to move to (3, 0) from `(4, 5)`, which is impossible in one turn.\n    -   **Board Limits:** (3, 0) is within 0-9.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **DOWN** is the only physically possible move. Moving Left, Right, or Up would collide with my *current* body positions, which will shift as I move. Moving Down leads to an empty square (3, 0) and avoids immediate collision. It also moves me away from the enemy snake at (4, 5).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSurvive the immediate trap. Once at (3, 0), I can navigate towards the apples at (0, 0) or (6, 0) in the bottom row.\n\nDOWN",

However, check for new collisions. My tail is currently (2, 2). When I move, my tail moves to (2, 1) (old (3, 1)). The destination (2, 0) is not in my new body list: [(3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2)]. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (4, 0). Currently marked '.' (Empty). My new body list is [(3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2)]. Safe.\n    *   **UP:** (3, 1). Currently marked 'T' (My Body). **Analysis:** My tail is (2, 2). When I move UP to (3, 1), my body shifts. The cell (3, 1) will be occupied by my head. The cell (2, 2) becomes empty (tail moves to (2, 1)). Therefore, (3, 1) is safe to move into because the body currently there will move away. **SAFE**.\n\n3.  **Decision:** I am between (2, 0) and (4, 0) on the bottom row, but I am currently sitting at (3, 0) directly under an empty space at (3, 1). Moving UP is the path of least resistance to open up movement space. Moving LEFT or RIGHT keeps me on the bottom edge, potentially trapping me against the wall. Moving UP into the open space allows me to pivot left towards the apple at (0, 0) or right towards the apple at (6, 0).\n\n**Enemy Status:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 6). They are far away and not an immediate threat to my position at (3, 0). I must focus on navigating out of the corner.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (3, 1). From there, I will have access to (3, 2) (my old body, now empty if I continue moving or safe depending on direction). My goal is to reach the apple at (0, 0) or (6, 0).
