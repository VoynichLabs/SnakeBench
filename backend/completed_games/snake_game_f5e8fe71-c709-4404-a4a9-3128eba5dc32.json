We shouldn\u2019t rely on opponent voluntarily losing.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,0)\n  - Safe this turn (empty cell).\n  - If enemy moves DOWN to (6,0): head-on collision, both die now; we win 10\u20136.\n  - If enemy moves RIGHT to (7,1) or UP to (6,2), we\u2019re alive with at least one safe follow-up (5,0), and the board opens up to the west as our long tail unwinds from the top-right.
