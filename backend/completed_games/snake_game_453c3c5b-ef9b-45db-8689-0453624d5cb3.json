The low\u2011row apple stash is screaming from the left side \u2013 especially the juicy one at **(0,0)** and the nearby (1,1).  \n\n**What are our options?**  \n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,1)** \u2013 safe, but it pushes us away from the bottom\u2011row bounty and adds an extra vertical step we don\u2019t need right now.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,0)** \u2013 completely open, keeps us marching toward the cluster of apples on the bottom row. No enemy nearby, and we stay on a straight line to the high\u2011value apples at (0,0) and (1,1).  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,0)** \u2013 that\u2019s moving directly back into the segment right behind our head (our own tail). The rules call that a \u201cbackwards\u201d move \u2013 instant death. \u274c  \n- **DOWN** is off\u2011grid.  \n\n**Opponent\u2019s next move** is far up at (8,8). Their safe choices are UP, DOWN or RIGHT \u2013 none of which intersect our low\u2011row path. No risk of a head\u2011on collision this turn.\n\n**Strategic pick:** Keep grinding leftwards, grab the apples on the bottom lane, and force the opponent to chase us up the board while we rack up points. This also leaves us plenty of future escape routes (we can always swing up later if needed).\n\nLet\u2019s lock it in and keep the pressure! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**LEFT**",

No immediate head\u2011on threat.  \n- Bottom\u2011row apples are screaming our names: **(0,0)** is right there, and **(1,1)** is just one step up\u2011and\u2011left.  \n- The rest of the board is pretty open; the only occupied cells are the opponent\u2019s three squares up top.\n\n**What are our safe moves?**  \n- **RIGHT** would hit our own tail (the cell directly behind us) \u2192 instant KO.  \n- **DOWN** is off\u2011grid.  \n- **UP \u2192 (5,1)** is safe, but it pulls us away from the low\u2011row bounty we can snag right now.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,0)** is completely open and keeps us marching straight toward the apple highway on the bottom edge.\n\n**Why LEFT is the play**  \n1. **Apple chase** \u2013 Every left step brings us closer to **(0,0)** and the cluster of apples at (1,1) and (0,2). Grab those early, grow, and force the opponent to navigate a longer, slower snake later.  \n2. **Safety** \u2013 The opponent is three rows up; there\u2019s zero chance of a simultaneous head\u2011on on (4,0).  \n3.Future flexibility** \u2013 From (4,0) we can keep sliding left, or pop up at any point to snag (1,1) without getting boxed. Our body will stay in a straight line, giving us clear exit routes.  \n4. **Aggression** \u2013 By hogging the low\u2011row apples we deny the enemy easy points and start building a length advantage that will be crucial for any future head\u2011on showdown.\n\n**Long\u2011term sketch** (to keep in the back of our mind):  \n- **Turn\u202f4\u20116**: keep heading LEFT until we reach **(1,0)**, then either up to **(1,1)** for the apple or straight to **(0,0)**.  \n- **After a few apples**: we\u2019ll have a longer body that can start threatening the opponent\u2019s corridor on the right side, maybe cut him off near column\u202f6\u20117.  \n- **Keep an eye** on the opponent\u2019s movements; if he drops down toward the bottom row we can pivot up and set a trap.\n\nAll signs point to the left\u2011most path being the safest, most rewarding, and most aggressive option right now. Let\u2019s lock it in and start munching those apples! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4f  \n\n**LEFT**",

We\u2019re left with UP or LEFT.\n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which move keeps me alive *and* feeds me?**  \nLEFT lands on an apple, gives me growth (+1 length) and a point. Growing is crucial \u2013 we\u2019re trailing 5 vs 12, so every apple counts. Plus it pulls the head away from the wall, opening up more future routes (instead of hanging on column\u202f9).\n\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 Could the opponent crash into me if I go LEFT?**  \nOpponent\u2019s head is at (2,\u202f8). Their possible moves are UP to (2,\u202f9), LEFT to (1,\u202f8) or RIGHT to (3,\u202f8). None intersect (8,\u202f3). So a safe collision\u2011free choice.\n\n**5\ufe0f\u20e3 Long\u2011term thought:**  \nAfter grabbing the apple, my new body will be  \n\ud83d\udfe2 (8,\u202f3) \u2192 (9,\u202f3) \u2192 (9,\u202f2) \u2192 (9,\u202f1) \u2192 (9,\u202f0) \u2192 (8,\u202f0) \u2192 (7,\u202f0)  \n\nThat extra segment gives me a slight edge in space control and makes it harder for the rival to box us in later. We keep the tail at (7,\u202f0) for now, but we\u2019ll have a wider corridor to maneuver around the right side of the board.\n\n**Decision:** Grab that tasty apple and stay alive! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nLEFT",

Legal moves: LEFT to (0,\u202f6) (apple) or DOWN to (1,\u202f5). Both stay on the far\u2011left side, far from our portal. No head\u2011on threat this turn.\n\n**Why UP is the smartest aggressive play**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Safety first** \u2013 UP lands on a free cell; we stay alive.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Open future options** \u2013 From (6,\u202f6) we\u2019ll have UP, LEFT, RIGHT all free, giving us flexibility to swing right toward the lucrative (9,\u202f9) apple or circle back down if needed.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Pressure the opponent** \u2013 By marching upward we claim the vertical highway on the right side, forcing the rival to stay boxed in the left corridor where their longer body limits them.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Apple potential** \u2013 The top\u2011right corner holds apples at (9,\u202f9) and (9,\u202f4). Climbing now sets us up for a high\u2011value grab while the opponent can\u2019t contest that zone.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan**  \n- **Turn\u202f30:** UP \u2192 (6,\u202f6) (no apple, just positioning).  \n- **Turns\u202f31\u201134:** Continue UP toward row\u202f9, then slide RIGHT along the top edge to snatch (9,\u202f9).  \n- Keep the opponent trapped on the left wall; if they ever try to cut across, we\u2019ll have the extra length to block them.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the aggression alive and chase those top\u2011right apples!  \n\nUP",
