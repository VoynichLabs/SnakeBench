Would kill me. \u2717\n\n**DOWN**: (2, -1) - Invalid, off the board (y < 0). Would kill me. \u2717\n\n**RIGHT**: (3, 0) - Valid move. The cell (3, 0) is empty and within bounds. \u2713\n\n**UP**: (2, 1) - Valid move. The cell (2, 1) is empty and within bounds. \u2713\n\nBoth RIGHT and UP are safe moves. I need to consider which direction puts me in a better position to reach the remaining apples. Looking at the apple positions:\n- (2, 5) - closest to me, directly above (5 spaces up)\n- (5, 6) - moderately close, up and to the right\n- (3, 7) - further but reachable\n- (2, 9) - north edge\n- (9, 8) - far east\n\nThe enemy snake at (7, 6) is closer to the apples at (5, 6) and (3, 7), so I should focus on the apple at (2, 5) which is my closest target and relatively safe from the enemy.\n\n**Strategy:** Move UP toward (2, 5). This gives me the clearest path to my nearest apple while keeping me away from the enemy snake. After this move to (2, 1), I'll continue heading north and can then plan to go RIGHT toward (3, 1), (4, 1), etc. to eventually reach the apple at (2, 5). The enemy is at (7, 6) and heading south based on its movement pattern, so I have time to collect (2, 5) safely.\n\n**Future planning note:** After reaching (2, 5), I should consider going for (3, 7) or circling back around to avoid getting trapped in the northern edge. The enemy snake has only 2 segments, so I have a size advantage and could potentially cut it off if needed.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,1) - Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,2) - Contains my own body segment (the first segment of my body). This would cause self-collision. DEADLY.\n- RIGHT: (9,2) - Empty. Safe.\n\nLEFT is immediately eliminated.\n\nNow, among safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- There is an apple at (9,3) which is close: RIGHT then UP would get it, but we need to think one move at a time.\n- Another apple at (9,8) is far, and (5,9) is also far.\n- Enemy snake is at (2,7), far away, no immediate threat.\n- My body is currently at [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)]. After moving, my tail will move (since I didn't eat an apple this turn? Wait, last move I collected an apple at (8,2)? Actually, last turn I moved RIGHT to (8,2) and collected the apple there. So now I have grown by one segment. Therefore, my body length is now 5 segments: head at (8,2), then the previous body (which was 4 segments) plus the new segment from growth? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment at the end of the tail. So my body should be: head at (8,2), then the old head (7,2) becomes first segment, then (6,2), (5,2), (5,3) and the tail remains at (5,3) because we grew? Actually, the growth happens by not removing the tail when moving. So after moving to (8,2) and eating, the body becomes: head (8,2), then previous segments: (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3) and we add a new segment at the tail? But wait, the body list is given as [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)] for this turn? That means the growth hasn't happened yet? Actually, the state is after the move? The turn number is 12, and last move was turn 11 when I moved RIGHT to (8,2) and collected the apple. So at the start of turn 12, my snake has grown: head at (8,2), body segments: the old head (7,2), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,3) and the tail should be extended? But the body list is still 4 segments? Wait, the body list is given as [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)] which is 4 segments. But I collected an apple last turn, so I should have 5 segments. There might be a discrepancy. Actually, the body list includes all segments except the head? No, the description says: \"Body: [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)]\" which is 4 segments. But with apples collected=4, the length should be initial length + apples = 3 + 4 = 7? Wait, initial snake length is 3? Actually, the rules don't specify initial length, but typically it's 3. So with 4 apples, length should be 3+4=7. But here only 4 segments are listed? This is confusing.\n\nLooking back at the board state:\nAt turn 12, my snake is shown as:\nHead: (8,2)\nBody: [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)] -> that's 4 segments, so total length 5 (head + 4 body). But with 4 apples, it should be initial 3 + 4 = 7. So there is an error? Or perhaps the initial length is 1? Actually, the body list does not include the head. So the full snake is head + body segments. So length = 1 + number of body segments. With 4 body segments, length=5. And apples collected=4, so initial length was 1? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the rules: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\" So the list includes the head and all body segments. So the number of elements in the list is the total length. For my snake: head (8,2) and body list has 4 elements, so total 5 segments. With apples collected=4, that means initial length was 1? Or perhaps the growth is applied after the move? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow at the end of the next move. So last turn I ate, so this turn I have grown? But the body list is still the same as before eating? This is ambiguous.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's rely on the board state representation:\n\nFrom the board:\nAt y=2: ... T T T 0 .   so at x=5,6,7 are body segments (T) and head at x=8 (0). So segments at (5,2), (6,2), (7,2) and head at (8,2). Also at (5,3) there is a T? So indeed, body segments: (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3). So length=5.\n\nSo after moving this turn, if I don't eat an apple, the tail will move (the last segment will be removed). If I do eat, the tail stays.\n\nNow, back to moves:\n\nSafe moves: UP (8,3), DOWN (8,1), RIGHT (9,2).\n\nWhich one is best?\n- RIGHT (9,2): moves me closer to the apple at (9,3). Next turn, I could go UP to (9,3) to get it.\n- UP (8,3): also moves toward (9,3) but less directly.\n- DOWN (8,1): moves away from apples.\n\nSo RIGHT is good to get closer to (9,3). Also, (9,2) is safe.\n\nIs there any risk of head-on collision with enemy? Enemy head at (2,7), far away.\n\nSo RIGHT seems best.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: after RIGHT to (9,2), next turn I can go UP to (9,3) to get the apple, or LEFT to (8,2) but that might be occupied by my body? Actually, after moving RIGHT, my body will be: new head at (9,2), then old head (8,2) becomes first segment, then (7,2), (6,2), (5,2) and the tail (5,3) will be removed (since no apple eaten). So body will be [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2)]. So (8,2) will be occupied. So from (9,2), LEFT to (8,2) would be deadly. But UP to (9,3) is safe and gets apple. DOWN to (9,1) is safe. RIGHT is off board. So only UP and DOWN are safe next turn if I go RIGHT now. That is acceptable.\n\nIf I go UP now to (8,3), then next turn from (8,3) I can go RIGHT to (9,3) to get apple, or UP to (8,4), or DOWN to (8,2) which might be occupied? After moving UP, body: head (8,3), then (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), and tail (5,2) removed? So (8,2) is occupied. So from (8,3), DOWN to (8,2) is deadly. So only UP and RIGHT are safe. Also good.\n\nBut RIGHT is more direct toward the apple.\n\nSo I choose RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan: After getting the apple at (9,3), consider moving toward (9,8) or (5,9). Avoid self-collision with growing body.\n\nRIGHT",

Also, check if safe: no snake body there (from board state, it's empty except the apple). So safe and beneficial (eat apple and grow).\n- DOWN: (9,1) - empty and safe (within board).\n- LEFT: (8,2) - contains my own body segment (the first segment of my body). Deadly.\n- RIGHT: off board (x=10) - deadly.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\nUP leads to eating the apple at (9,3). This will grow my snake by one segment. After eating, my body will extend: the tail remains, so the new body will be [old head (9,2) becomes first segment, then (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2)] and the tail stays at (5,2)? Actually, when you eat, you grow by not removing the tail. So the body length increases by one. So after moving UP to (9,3) and eating, the head becomes (9,3), and the body becomes [(9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2)] (so length 6).\n\nDOWN to (9,1) is safe but doesn't eat an apple. After moving DOWN, the tail moves: head becomes (9,1), body becomes [(9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2)] (length 5).\n\nClearly, UP is better because it gets an apple and grows. Also, it puts me in a good position to potentially go for other apples like (9,8) later.\n\nIs there any risk with UP? The enemy snake is far away at (2,8), so no immediate threat. Also, no other snakes are nearby.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (9,3), consider moving upward toward (9,8) or left toward (5,9). Avoid self-collision as my body grows. Also, watch for enemy snake #1 which has the same score and might be competing for apples.\n\nUP",

Deadly.\n- LEFT: (8,5) - empty and safe (within board).\n- RIGHT: off board (x=10) - deadly.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow evaluate:\n- UP: (9,6) - continues upward toward the apple at (9,8). This is a direct path to an apple. The enemy is at (4,9) and might be targeting (0,9) or (5,9), so (9,8) is relatively uncontested. Moving up is safe and gets me closer to the apple.\n- LEFT: (8,5) - moves left into open space. This might be useful to avoid being trapped on the right wall and to eventually target apples like (5,9) or (5,8). However, it doesn't immediately get me closer to an apple compared to UP.\n\nWhich is better?\nUP is more aggressive and continues the path to (9,8). It is only 2 moves away from the apple (after (9,6), then (9,7), then (9,8)). This is efficient and safe.\n\nLEFT is safe but delays apple collection. There is no immediate apple nearby in the left direction. The closest apples are (5,9) and (5,8), which are 3-4 moves away and might be contested by enemy #1.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: After UP to (9,6), I can go UP again to (9,7) (which should be safe) and then to (9,8) to collect the apple. This path is clear.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (4,9) and might move toward (0,9) or (5,9). It is unlikely to come to (9,8) soon.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to pursue the apple.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP to (9,6), continue upward to collect (9,8).

This increases my score to 6. After collecting, my snake will grow by one segment. The next segment added will be at the tail end, so my head moves to (9,8) and the tail remains at (9,2) (since we grow by not removing the tail this turn). This is highly efficient. However, after moving to (9,8), I need to consider next moves: from (9,8), I can go DOWN (to (9,7) which will be occupied by my body next turn? Actually, after growth, the body will be [(9,8), (9,7), (9,6), ... (9,2)] so (9,7) is my body. So DOWN is deadly. LEFT to (8,8) is safe. RIGHT is off board. So only LEFT is safe from (9,8) next turn. This is a potential trap? But we can handle it next turn by going LEFT.\n- LEFT: (8,7) - moves left into open space. This avoids the right wall and gives more flexibility.

However, it doesn't collect an apple immediately.\n\nWhich is better?\nUP collects an apple immediately and increases my score. Even though it leaves only one safe move next turn (LEFT), that is acceptable because we can then plan to escape the top-right corner. The enemy is at (5,8) which is far and not threatening (9,8) immediately.\n\nLEFT is safe but doesn't progress toward an apple. The closest apples are (0,9), (4,2), (1,0), (0,1). All are several moves away. Moving LEFT might be better for long-term survival but short-term we lose an opportunity.\n\nConsider enemy #1: It is at (5,8). From there, it can move UP to (5,9) (its own body), DOWN to (5,7) (empty), LEFT to (4,8) (empty), RIGHT to (6,8) (empty). So it has multiple options. It might be targeting the apple at (4,2) or (0,9)? But (0,9) is far. Actually, (5,8) is close to (4,2)? Not really. The enemy might be moving randomly.\n\nGiven that UP collects an apple and is safe, it is the best move. We should take the apple when we can.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP to (9,8) and collecting the apple, next turn we must go LEFT to (8,8). Then from (8,8), we can go DOWN to (8,7) or LEFT to (7,8) to avoid the top-right corner. We should aim to move toward the center to target other apples like (4,2) or (0,9). But note that enemy #1 has 7 apples (more than me) and we need to catch up.\n\nFor now, UP is clear.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- DOWN: (9,7) - contains my own body segment. Deadly.\n- LEFT: (8,8) - empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: off board (x=10). Deadly.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow evaluate:\n- UP: (9,9) - moves to top-right corner. This is a dead-end: from (9,9), only DOWN (to (9,8) which will be occupied by my body next turn) and LEFT (to (8,9)) are possible. But DOWN is deadly, so only LEFT is safe. This is risky because it traps us in the corner with only one exit next turn.\n- LEFT: (8,8) - moves left into open space. From (8,8), we can go UP to (8,9) (safe), DOWN to (8,7) (safe), LEFT to (7,8) (safe). Multiple options. This keeps flexibility and avoids dead-ends.\n\nConsider apples: The closest apple is (8,4) - 4 steps away (manhattan distance). Moving LEFT doesn't directly get us closer, but it opens paths downward. The enemy is at (4,8), which is far and not an immediate threat. However, enemy has 7 apples (more than us) and we need to catch up.\n\nLong-term: We should avoid the top-right corner. Moving UP to (9,9) is dangerous because it limits our options. Moving LEFT to (8,8) is better for survival and future flexibility. From (8,8), we can plan to move down toward (8,4) or other apples.\n\nAlso, note that enemy #1 might be moving toward (4,2) or other apples. We should not risk getting trapped.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the better move. It keeps multiple safe follow-up moves and avoids dead-ends.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving LEFT to (8,8), consider going DOWN to (8,7) to approach the apple at (8,4). Alternatively, we can go LEFT further to (7,8) to avoid the edge. We need to target apples efficiently while maintaining escape routes.\n\nLEFT",

Deadly.\n- DOWN: (8,6) - empty (from board state). Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,7) - empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,7) - contains my own body segment (third segment). Deadly.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow evaluate:\n- DOWN: (8,6) - moves down toward the apple at (8,4). From (8,6), next moves: UP (to (8,7) which will be occupied by my body next turn), DOWN (8,5), LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6) (which is my body). So only DOWN and LEFT are safe next turn. This directly approaches the apple at (8,4).\n- LEFT: (7,7) - moves left into open space. From (7,7), next moves: UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7) (occupied next turn). So three safe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT. This maintains flexibility but doesn't directly approach any apple.\n\nThe apple at (8,4) is very close (only 2 steps away via DOWN). We should prioritize collecting it to catch up to snake #1 (7 vs 6 apples). Moving DOWN gets us closer and is safe.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,7), which is far and not an immediate threat. It might be moving toward (4,2) or other apples.\n\nLong-term: After getting (8,4), we can consider other apples like (4,2) or (0,9). But immediate goal is to secure the nearby apple.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move to efficiently collect the apple and avoid risks.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (8,6), we should continue DOWN to (8,5) and then (8,4) to get the apple. Then we can reassess: possibly move LEFT to (7,4) to avoid trapping ourselves against the right wall and explore toward center.\n\nDOWN",

This is much better than last turn when I only had one option.\n\n**Current priorities:**\n- I'm leading 7-6 in apples\n- Snake #0 is at (8, 7) on the eastern edge\n- Available apples: (0, 9), (4, 2), (1, 0), (0, 1), (8, 4)\n\n**Evaluating the three safe moves:**\n\n1. **DOWN to (3, 6)**: Moves me south, away from the northern edge where my body is coiled. This could help me work toward the apple at (4, 2). However, it keeps me in the central area.\n\n2. **LEFT to (2, 7)**: Moves me west, toward the western apple cluster at (1, 0), (0, 1), and eventually (0, 9). This seems strategically sound as snake #0 is on the opposite side and can't easily reach these apples.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (4, 7)**: Moves me east, toward the center and closer to (4, 2). However, this brings me closer to snake #0's territory.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT to (2, 7) is the best strategic choice. It moves me toward the western apple cluster which is:\n- Farthest from snake #0\n- Contains multiple apples (1, 0), (0, 1), and eventually (0, 9)\n- Gives me room to maneuver without immediate collision risk\n\nFrom (2, 7), I can continue west and south toward the apple cluster while staying away from the eastern edge where snake #0 is positioned.\n\n**Future plan for next turns:**\nContinue heading west/southwest toward the western apple cluster. Target (1, 0) first, then (0, 1), and potentially (0, 9). Maintain distance from snake #0 on the eastern edge. Keep evaluating available moves to avoid getting trapped.\n\nLEFT",

However, this brings me closer to my own body which is coiled in the northern region (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (4, 9).\n\n3. **DOWN to (1, 6)**: Moves me south toward the center, potentially positioning me to reach the apple at (4, 2). This gives me more open space to maneuver.\n\n**Decision:**\nContinuing LEFT to (0, 7) remains the best choice. This maintains my westward trajectory toward the western apple cluster, which:\n- Keeps me far from snake #0 on the eastern edge\n- Positions me to efficiently collect multiple apples: (1, 0), (0, 1), and potentially (0, 9)\n- Maintains good mobility with room to maneuver\n- Avoids the tightly coiled northern region where my body is located\n\nFrom (0, 7), I'll have flexibility to go south toward (1, 0) and (0, 1), or continue north toward (0, 9) depending on the board state.\n\nLEFT",

Deadly.\n- DOWN: (8,4) - contains an apple. Safe and beneficial.\n- LEFT: (7,5) - empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,5) - empty? From board state, (9,5) is not listed as occupied. Actually, looking at the board: row 5 has \"0\" at (8,5) and nothing at (9,5). So it should be safe. But wait: my tail is at (9,6), and (9,5) is adjacent. However, since we are moving simultaneously, and my tail will move if I don't eat an apple? Actually, if I move DOWN to eat the apple, I will grow and the tail stays. Otherwise, if I move LEFT or RIGHT without eating, the tail moves.\n\nBut for this turn:\n- RIGHT: (9,5) is currently empty. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate:\n- DOWN: (8,4) - apple. Eating this will grow to 7 segments (same as enemy) and score 7 apples. However, after eating, we will be at (8,4) with body segments behind. Next moves from (8,4): UP (8,5) (occupied by my body next turn), DOWN (8,3) (safe), LEFT (7,4) (safe), RIGHT (9,4) (safe). So three safe options. But note: moving DOWN gets the apple immediately.\n- LEFT: (7,5) - moves away from the apple. From (7,5), next moves: UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5) (occupied next turn). So three safe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n- RIGHT: (9,5) - moves right. From (9,5), next moves: UP (9,6) (occupied by my tail? Actually, if I don't eat, my tail moves: current tail is (9,6) and will shift to (9,7)? But after this move, if I go RIGHT without eating, my head goes to (9,5), and the tail moves to (8,6)? Actually, the entire body shifts: head moves to (9,5), then segments: (8,5) becomes new segment 2, (8,6) becomes segment 3, etc. So (9,6) will be vacated. So next turn from (9,5): UP (9,6) will be empty? Actually, it depends on the body shift. But generally, it should be safe. However, moving RIGHT might be risky because the right wall has limited space and our body is there. But for now, it's safe.\n\nPrioritize getting the apple at (8,4) to catch up to the enemy (7 vs 6). Moving DOWN collects it immediately. This is efficient.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,7), which is far. It might be moving toward (0,9) or (4,2). Not an immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move to get the apple and increase our score.\n\nAfter eating, we will be at (8,4) with 7 segments. Then we should move LEFT (to (7,4)) or DOWN (to (8,3)) to avoid being trapped against the right wall. The apple at (4,2) is a good next target.\n\nSo plan: Move DOWN to (8,4) to eat the apple. Then next turn, move LEFT or DOWN to open space.\n\nDOWN",

LEFT: (6,1) - this is an apple!\n   - Eating the apple will grow my snake by one segment. The new tail will be the same as current tail (since we grow by one, the tail doesn't move this turn).\n   - After eating, my head will be at (6,1), and my body will be: [(7,1), (7,2), ... , (8,7)] (8 segments).\n   - Next moves from (6,1): UP (6,2) (safe), DOWN (6,0) (safe), LEFT (5,1) (safe), RIGHT (7,1) (occupied by my new body next turn).

After that, we can consider going for (4,2) or (1,0)/(0,1). The enemy has 8 segments and is longer, so we should avoid head-on collisions. Since we are shorter, we have more mobility.\n\nLEFT is the best move because it directly eats the apple at (6,1), tying the score and growing our snake. It also leaves us with three safe options next turn. DOWN leads to a position with only two safe options (dead end at bottom). RIGHT moves away from the apples and doesn't help our immediate goal.\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

UP (to (5,2)) also allows eating by moving LEFT next turn.\n\nHowever, LEFT is slightly better because:\n- From (4,1), we have three safe moves (including UP to eat the apple) and we are closer to other apples like (1,0) and (0,1).\n- UP to (5,2) also has three safe moves, but we are one step further from the apple cluster on the left.\n\nAlso, note that the board has an apple at (8,2) which is near my tail, but it might be risky to go right since my body is there. Prioritize left apples.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (4,2) next turn, then consider moving towards (1,0) and (0,1) to catch up. Avoid getting trapped in the bottom-left corner. Enemy is far, so focus on apple collection.\n\nLEFT is the best move because it positions us to eat (4,2) next turn and maintains flexibility with three safe options. It also avoids the dead-end that DOWN leads to.\n\nLEFT",

Eating it would grow us to 9 segments (tie with enemy) and the apple is safe (not occupied by any snake).\n- DOWN: (4,0) - currently empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,1) - currently empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,1) - occupied by my own body (first segment). Deadly.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow evaluate each safe move:\n\n1. UP: (4,2) - eat the apple! This would immediately give us 9 apples (tying with enemy) and grow our body. After eating, our head would be at (4,2) and we'd have a new body segment added (so tail remains at (8,5) for now). Next moves from (4,2): UP (4,3) (safe), DOWN (4,1) (occupied by our new body next turn? Actually, after eating, our body extends so the old tail doesn't move, but the head moves to (4,2) and the body becomes [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), ...] so DOWN to (4,1) would be occupied by our own body next turn. Similarly, LEFT (3,2) (safe), RIGHT (5,2) (safe). So two safe moves: UP and LEFT? Actually, DOWN would be deadly because it's our own body. So safe moves from (4,2) after eating: UP, LEFT, RIGHT? Wait: (4,1) is now our second segment, so DOWN is deadly. So UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe. Three options.\n\n2. DOWN: (4,0) - safe but no apple. Next moves from (4,0): UP (4,1) (occupied by our body next turn), DOWN (4,-1) (off board, deadly), LEFT (3,0) (safe), RIGHT (5,0) (safe). So only two safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. This leads to a dead-end with fewer options.\n\n3. LEFT: (3,1) - safe but no apple. Next moves from (3,1): UP (3,2) (safe), DOWN (3,0) (safe), LEFT (2,1) (safe), RIGHT (4,1) (occupied next turn). So three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Good flexibility.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (4,8) and is far away. It is not an immediate threat.\n\nWe are behind by one apple (8 vs 9). Eating the apple at (4,2) would tie us with the enemy. This is crucial to catch up.\n\nUP is the best move because it immediately eats the apple, tying the score and growing our snake. It also leaves us with three safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) from (4,2). DOWN and LEFT are safe but do not get the apple this turn, delaying our progress.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (4,2), we should consider moving towards the apples at (1,0) and (0,1) to gain the lead. Avoid the enemy and our own body. The apple at (8,2) is near our tail but might be risky due to body proximity. Prioritize left-side apples for now.\n\nUP is the optimal move to secure the apple and tie the game.\nUP",

Since they just ate, they're probably heading toward nearby apples.\n\n**My best strategy:**\nFrom (4, 7), I should move LEFT to (3, 7). This:\n1.

Avoids getting trapped in the right side where the enemy is heading\n\nRIGHT to (5, 7) would move me closer to the enemy's territory and away from the concentration of apples on the left. DOWN to (4, 6) is safe but less optimal for reaching the left-side apples.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy is at (2,7) and might be heading for (1,5), so we are safe for now. Monitor the apple at (8,2) which might be an option later if we loop around.**\nLEFT",

Safe.\n- DOWN: (1,1) - has an apple! Safe (eating apple grows us, so we don't immediately collide with our tail).\n- LEFT: (0,2) - currently empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,2) - occupied by my own body (first segment). Deadly.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow evaluate each safe move:\n\n1. UP: (1,3) - no apple. Next moves from (1,3): UP (1,4) (safe), DOWN (1,2) (occupied by our body next turn), LEFT (0,3) (safe), RIGHT (2,3) (safe). So three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Good flexibility.\n\n2. DOWN: (1,1) - has an apple! Eating it will grow us to 10 segments (score 10). Next moves from (1,1): UP (1,2) (occupied next turn), DOWN (1,0) (has an apple! and safe), LEFT (0,1) (has an apple! and safe), RIGHT (2,1) (occupied by our body). So two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. Both lead to apples! This is very promising.\n\n3. LEFT: (0,2) - no apple. Next moves from (0,2): UP (0,3) (safe), DOWN (0,1) (has an apple! and safe), LEFT (-1,2) (off-board! deadly), RIGHT (1,2) (occupied next turn). So only two safe moves: UP and DOWN. DOWN leads to an apple at (0,1).\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,7). It might move towards the apple at (1,5) or other areas. We are currently far from it.\n\nLong-term plan: We are tied at 9 apples. We need to collect more apples to take the lead. The cluster of apples at (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1) is very attractive. Moving DOWN to (1,1) immediately eats an apple and puts us in a position to eat (1,0) or (0,1) next turn. This is the fastest way to gain the lead.\n\nDOWN is the best move because:\n- It immediately eats an apple (score 10, taking the lead).\n- It has two safe follow-ups (DOWN to (1,0) or LEFT to (0,1)), both of which are apples. This means we can potentially eat two apples in two turns.\n- It avoids moving into a dead-end (LEFT to (0,2) has only two safe moves and one is off-board).\n- UP is safe but doesn't progress towards apples as directly.\n\nWe should prioritize securing the apples quickly to get ahead. The enemy might be heading for (1,5), but we are focused on the bottom-left cluster.\n\nDOWN\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN: After moving DOWN to (1,1) and eating the apple, we will have 10 segments. Next turn, we can choose between DOWN to (1,0) (another apple) or LEFT to (0,1) (another apple). Both are safe. We should choose one based on which gives better future options. Avoid moving back up into our body. The enemy is still far away.**\nDOWN",

Deadly.\n- DOWN: (1,0) - has an apple! Safe (eating apple grows us, so we don't immediately collide with our tail).\n- LEFT: (0,1) - has an apple! Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,1) - occupied by my own body (segment at (5,1) is not adjacent, but (2,1) is empty? Wait, check body: body segments are [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), ...]. (2,1) is not in the body list. So it should be safe? But let's verify: the board state shows at (2,1): in the grid, row 1 (y=1) has \"0\" at x=1, then \".\" at x=2? Actually, the board state:\nRow 1: \"A 0 . . T T T T . .\" meaning (0,1)=A, (1,1)=0 (our head), (2,1)=. (empty), (3,1)=., (4,1)=T (our body), etc.\nSo (2,1) is empty. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo all moves except UP are safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate each safe move:\n\n1. DOWN: (1,0) - has an apple! Eating it would grow us to 11 segments (score 11). Next moves from (1,0): UP (1,1) (occupied by our body next turn), DOWN (1,-1) (off-board, deadly), LEFT (0,0) (empty? board shows (0,0) is \".\"), RIGHT (2,0) (empty). So only two safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. LEFT (0,0) is safe but no apple. RIGHT (2,0) is safe but no apple. So after eating, we have two safe moves but neither leads to an apple immediately.\n\n2. LEFT: (0,1) - has an apple! Eating it would grow us to 11 segments (score 11). Next moves from (0,1): UP (0,2) (empty), DOWN (0,0) (empty), LEFT (-1,1) (off-board, deadly), RIGHT (1,1) (occupied by our body next turn). So two safe moves: UP and DOWN. Both are empty (no apples). So similar to DOWN.\n\n3. RIGHT: (2,1) - no apple. Next moves from (2,1): UP (2,2) (occupied by our body? body has (2,2)), DOWN (2,0) (empty), LEFT (1,1) (occupied next turn), RIGHT (3,1) (empty). So only two safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. Both empty.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,6). It might be heading towards the apple at (1,5) (which is directly below it). It could also move towards other areas.\n\nLong-term plan: We are now at 10 apples, enemy at 9. We need to secure more apples to extend our lead. The apples at (1,0) and (0,1) are very close. We should eat one of them immediately to get to 11. Then we need to plan an escape from the bottom-left corner to avoid getting trapped.\n\nComparing DOWN and LEFT: both lead to an apple and have similar future options (two safe moves each after eating). However, note that after eating (1,0) via DOWN, we can move LEFT to (0,0) or RIGHT to (2,0). Similarly, after eating (0,1) via LEFT, we can move UP to (0,2) or DOWN to (0,0).\n\nBut there is also an apple at (4,0) which is to the right. So moving RIGHT to (2,1) doesn't eat an apple but might set us up to go towards (4,0) later? However, it is riskier because we don't gain an apple this turn and the enemy might eat one.\n\nPrioritize eating an apple now to increase our lead. So we should choose between DOWN and LEFT.\n\nWhich one? Consider the enemy: it is at (1,6) and might come down for (1,5). We are safe for now. Also, there is an apple at (1,5) which the enemy might target. But we are far.\n\nAfter eating (1,0) via DOWN, we can go RIGHT to (2,0) and then potentially up to (2,1) and then right towards (4,0)? Similarly, after eating (0,1) via LEFT, we can go UP to (0,2) and then right to (1,2) (but (1,2) is our body) or further right.\n\nActually, (0,2) is empty. So from (0,1), UP to (0,2) is safe. Then from (0,2), we can go RIGHT to (1,2) (but that will be occupied by our body next turn? Actually, our body will move: after we eat, the tail grows so the body becomes longer. But the head moves first.\n\nThis is complex. Since both DOWN and LEFT are equally good in terms of immediate apple gain, we can choose either. But note: if we go LEFT to (0,1), we are at the edge. Similarly for DOWN to (1,0).\n\nI think RIGHT is less good because it doesn't eat an apple.\n\nSo between DOWN and LEFT, let's choose DOWN to (1,0) because it leaves LEFT (0,0) and RIGHT (2,0) open. From (2,0), we can later go UP to (2,1) and then right to (3,1), etc., to reach (4,0). This path seems more open.\n\nLEFT to (0,1) leads to UP (0,2) and DOWN (0,0). (0,2) is a dead-end with only RIGHT (1,2) which might be blocked by our body.\n\nSo DOWN is slightly better.\n\nTherefore, move DOWN to eat the apple at (1,0).\n\nDOWN\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN: After moving DOWN to (1,0) and eating the apple, we will have 11 segments. Next turn, we can choose between LEFT (0,0) or RIGHT (2,0). Both are safe. Prefer RIGHT to (2,0) to avoid getting trapped in the corner and to move towards the apple at (4,0). The enemy is still at (1,6) and might be going for (1,5). We are extending our lead.**\nDOWN",

Maintains flexibility - from (1, 4) I can go LEFT to (0, 4), RIGHT to (2, 4), or continue DOWN to (1, 3)\n5. Creates distance from the congested top area where my long tail is located\n\nWhile LEFT to (0, 5) or RIGHT to (2, 5) are also safe, DOWN offers the best path toward the bottom-left apples while keeping my options open.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move down toward the bottom area to collect (0, 1) or (4, 0), while monitoring the enemy snake's position to avoid collisions.\n\nDOWN",

Deadly.\n- DOWN: (1,-1) - off-board. Deadly.\n- LEFT: (0,0) - empty (safe).\n- RIGHT: (2,0) - empty (safe).\n\nSo only safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nEvaluate each safe move:\n\n1. LEFT: (0,0) - no apple. Next moves from (0,0): UP (0,1) (has an apple), DOWN (0,-1) (off-board, deadly), LEFT (-1,0) (off-board, deadly), RIGHT (1,0) (occupied by our body next turn). So only one safe move: UP to (0,1) which has an apple. But note: after moving to (0,0), we have only one escape route (UP) which is good because it leads to an apple.\n\n2. RIGHT: (2,0) - no apple. Next moves from (2,0): UP (2,1) (empty), DOWN (2,-1) (off-board, deadly), LEFT (1,0) (occupied by our body next turn), RIGHT (3,0) (empty). So two safe moves: UP and RIGHT. Both are empty. This gives more options but no immediate apple.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,5). It might move towards the apple at (0,1) or (4,0) or others. Note that (0,1) is close to us. If we move LEFT to (0,0), we can then go UP to (0,1) next turn to eat that apple. The enemy might also try to get (0,1) but it is farther away (enemy head at (1,5) would need at least 4 moves: e.g., DOWN to (1,4), LEFT to (0,4), DOWN to (0,3), DOWN to (0,2), DOWN to (0,1) - but we can get there in one move from (0,0)). So we can secure (0,1) if we go LEFT now and then UP next.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (2,0), we have more options but no apple nearby. The apple at (4,0) is two moves away (RIGHT to (3,0) then RIGHT to (4,0)), but we might face competition from the enemy? Also, our body is in the way.\n\nLong-term: We have a lead (11 vs 10). We should try to eat another apple to extend our lead. The closest apple is (0,1). So moving LEFT to (0,0) sets us up to eat (0,1) next turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2,0) avoids the corner but doesn't lead directly to an apple. However, it might be safer if we are worried about the enemy? But the enemy is not near (0,0) or (2,0).\n\nTherefore, prefer LEFT to (0,0) to position ourselves to eat (0,1) next turn.\n\nPlan for next turn: From (0,0), move UP to (0,1) to eat the apple. Then we will have 12 segments. After that, from (0,1), we can go UP to (0,2) (empty) or RIGHT to (1,1) (occupied by body) - so only UP is safe. But that is acceptable. We can then plan to escape the left edge by moving rightwards from (0,2) to (1,2) (if it becomes free) or further.\n\nSo choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

LEFT and RIGHT are not safe.\n\nApples are at: (8, 2), (4, 0), (9, 4), (8, 4), (6, 2)\n\nThe apple at (6, 2) is directly below the enemy snake's head at (6, 3). The enemy could move DOWN to (6, 2) to get that apple this turn.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 2), I'd be positioned to potentially get to (6, 2) next turn if the enemy doesn't take it. If I move UP to (5, 4), I'd be moving away from most apples except those in the top right area.\n\nThe enemy snake at (6, 3) has several options: DOWN to (6, 2) for the apple, LEFT to (5, 3) (but I'm already at (5, 3)), UP to (6, 4), or RIGHT to (7, 3). The most likely move for them is DOWN to get the apple at (6, 2).\n\nMoving DOWN to (5, 2) puts me in a good position to potentially get the (6, 2) apple next turn if the enemy doesn't take it, or to move toward other apples. Moving UP to (5, 4) is safe but doesn't advance me toward any immediate apples.\n\nLong-term strategy: Continue moving toward the apple-rich area while avoiding conflicts with the enemy. From (5, 2), next turn consider RIGHT to (6, 2) if apple still there, or continue DOWN/UP to avoid potential conflicts. The enemy has 11 apples vs my 12, so I'm slightly ahead and should avoid risky moves.\n\nDOWN",

Safe to collect\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe moves. UP and LEFT would kill me.\n\nThe apple at (6, 1) is directly to my right.

They'll likely move UP to (9, 5) since DOWN leads to (9, 3) which is closer to my territory.\n\nCollecting the apple at (6, 1) is the optimal move - it brings me closer to tying the score, puts me in a good position near other apples at (6, 9) and (2, 6), and avoids potential conflicts with the enemy snake who is trapped in the top-right corner.\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I should consider moving toward the apple at (6, 9) or (2, 6) to potentially take the lead, while being mindful of my body which is concentrated in the bottom-left area.\n\nRIGHT",

UP and DOWN would kill me.\n\nThe apple at (4, 0) is directly to my left, and (3, 0) is also nearby. Moving LEFT would position me to potentially collect these apples next turn.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 at (8, 5) has options:\n- UP: (8, 6) - Empty\n- DOWN: (8, 4) - Their own body, would die\n- LEFT: (7, 5) - Empty\n- RIGHT: (9, 5) - Their own body, would die\n\nSo enemy snake #1 can only move UP or LEFT. They'll likely move UP to (8, 6) to avoid moving toward my territory.\n\nMoving LEFT puts me in position to collect the bottom apples (4, 0) and (3, 0) which are very close. Moving RIGHT takes me away from these apples and doesn't immediately lead to any other apples.\n\nLong-term strategy: I should collect the apples at (4, 0) and (3, 0) to tie the score with snake #1, then work my way toward (2, 6) while avoiding getting trapped by my own long body in the bottom-left area.

UP, DOWN, and RIGHT would all kill me.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3, 0) will collect an apple, giving me 16 apples and taking the lead over snake #1 (15 apples). This is strategically good as it gives me the advantage.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 at (7, 6) has options:\n- UP: (7, 7) - Empty\n- DOWN: (7, 5) - Their own body, would die\n- LEFT: (6, 6) - Empty\n- RIGHT: (8, 6) - Empty\n\nSo enemy snake #1 can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. They'll likely avoid DOWN into their body. They might move toward the apples at (6,9) or (9,1)/(9,0).\n\nLong-term strategy: After collecting the apple at (3, 0), I'll be at 16 apples. My body is creating a tight area in the bottom-left corner. I need to find an escape path upward. From (3, 0), my only safe move next turn would be UP to (3, 1) - but that's my own body. Actually, looking ahead: from (3, 0), the only adjacent cells are (3, 1) [my body], (2, 0) [empty], and (4, 0) [my body]. So LEFT would be the only safe move? Wait, no: from (3, 0), moves would be:\n- UP: (3, 1) - my body\n- DOWN: (3, -1) - off board\n- LEFT: (2, 0) - empty\n- RIGHT: (4, 0) - my body\n\nSo only LEFT to (2, 0) would be safe next turn. This means I'm getting trapped in the bottom-left corner. I need to be careful - after this move, I'll have to go to (2, 0), then potentially (1, 0), (0, 0), but then I'll be completely boxed in. I should start planning an upward escape route soon, but for now, collecting the apple is necessary.\n\nLEFT",

My body segments: [(2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)]\n\nApples available: (6, 9), (2, 6), (9, 1), (9, 0), (7, 3)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (3, 6) with body: [(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)]\n\nAvailable moves:\n- UP: (2, 3) - This is my own body (last segment: (3,3) is adjacent? Actually (2,3) is not in my body list. Wait, my body ends at (3,3). (2,3) is empty? But check the board state: at (2,3) there is a 'T' (tail) from snake #1? Actually, looking at the board:\n   Row 3: \". . . T T T T A T .\" so (2,3) is the third column? Columns are 0-9. (2,3) is x=2,y=3. In row 3 (y=3), the columns are 0 to 9: column0: '.', column1: '.', column2: '.', column3: 'T', ... So (2,3) is actually empty? Wait, the board is printed with x from 0 to 9 horizontally, and y from 9 to 0 vertically. So for y=3, the row is: \n   x=0: . , x=1: . , x=2: . , x=3: T, x=4: T, x=5: T, x=6: T, x=7: A, x=8: T, x=9: .\n   So (2,3) is empty (dot). But wait, my body has (3,3) which is at x=3,y=3 (which is a T). So (2,3) is safe? But let's confirm with the body list: my body ends at (3,3). So (2,3) is not in my body. However, the enemy snake has a body at (8,3) and (7,2) etc., but not at (2,3). So UP to (2,3) should be safe.\n\n- DOWN: (2, 1) - This is my own body (first segment after head), would die.\n- LEFT: (1, 2) - Check: x=1,y=2. Board row y=2: \". . 0 T T T T T T .\" so (1,2) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3, 2) - This is my own body (eleventh segment: (3,2) is in my body list). Would die.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow strategic analysis:\n- UP (2,3) moves me upward toward the apple at (2,6). This is a direct path upward.\n- LEFT (1,2) moves me to the left edge. From there, I can only go UP or RIGHT (DOWN is off board? Actually (1,1) is safe? But wait, my body is at (2,1) and (2,0), but (1,1) is empty. So from (1,2), DOWN to (1,1) would be safe next turn? But that doesn't progress toward apples.\n\nThe apple at (2,6) is very attractive. Also, the enemy snake is at (3,6), which is adjacent to (2,6). So if I move up, I need to be cautious about the enemy. However, this turn I move to (2,3), and enemy moves simultaneously. Enemy head at (3,6) can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Possible moves for enemy:\n- UP: (3,7) - empty? Board y=7: all dots, so safe.\n- DOWN: (3,5) - empty? Board y=5: \". . . . . . . T T T\" so (3,5) is '.' safe.\n- LEFT: (2,6) - this is the apple cell? Actually apple at (2,6) is 'A'. So if enemy moves LEFT to (2,6), it eats the apple and grows. But that doesn't kill me directly.\n- RIGHT: (4,6) - which is its own body (first segment), would die.\n\nSo enemy might move LEFT to eat the apple, or UP/DOWN. If enemy moves LEFT to (2,6), it will be there next turn. Then if I continue up to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), I might collide head-on with it at (2,6) if we arrive same turn. But that is several turns away.\n\nFor now, moving UP is better to approach the apple. Also, from (2,3), I have UP to (2,4), LEFT to (1,3), RIGHT to (3,3) (but (3,3) is my body? Actually (3,3) is my tail? But wait, my body ends at (3,3). However, when I move, my tail might move? Actually, since I didn't eat an apple, my tail will move forward. So after I move to (2,3), my body becomes: head at (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), ... and the tail (3,3) will move? Actually, the entire body shifts: the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the next segment. So the tail (which was at (3,3)) will become the new position of the segment before it? Actually, the last segment (tail) is dropped if no apple eaten. So after moving to (2,3), my body will be: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), ... up to (4,3)] and the tail will be at (3,3)? Wait, let's simulate: current body has 16 segments (head + 15 body). After moving without eating, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed. So new body will be head at (2,3), then the first 15 segments of old body: (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). So the tail is at (5,3). Therefore, (3,3) is no longer in my body. So from (2,3), RIGHT to (3,3) would be safe next turn.\n\nSo UP gives good options: next turn from (2,3) I can go UP to (2,4), LEFT to (1,3), or RIGHT to (3,3).\n\nLEFT to (1,2) is safe but less advantageous. From (1,2), next turn I can go UP to (1,3), RIGHT to (2,2) (which will be empty? Since I moved away), or DOWN to (1,1) (safe). But it doesn't progress toward apples as directly.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to continue toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nLong-term plan: Move upward to (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5). Be aware that enemy might be at (2,6) if it moves left. If enemy is at (2,6), I can consider moving right to (3,5) etc. to avoid head-on collision and target other apples like (7,3). But for now, proceed upward.\n\nUP",

My body segments: [(2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3)] (16 segments total, including head).\n\nApples available: (6, 9), (9, 1), (9, 0), (7, 3), (9, 9)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (2, 6) with body: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)]\n\nAvailable moves:\n- UP: (2, 4) - Check board: y=4 row: \". . . . . . T . T T\" so (2,4) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- DOWN: (2, 2) - This is my own body (second segment). Would die.\n- LEFT: (1, 3) - Check: x=1,y=3. Board y=3: \". . . T T T T A T .\" so (1,3) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3, 3) - Check: x=3,y=3. Board y=3: column 3 is 'T' (my own body? Actually, my body includes (3,2) and (4,3), but (3,3) is not in my current body list. However, after last move, my tail moved to (5,3). So (3,3) is empty? But wait, the board shows at y=3: x=3 is 'T'. That might be enemy? Enemy snake has body at (8,3) but not (3,3). Actually, the board representation uses 'T' for any tail, but it doesn't specify which snake. So we need to check coordinates. My body does not include (3,3). Enemy body: (8,3) is enemy, but (3,3) is not listed. So (3,3) should be empty. However, the board shows 'T' at x=3,y=3. This might be a misrepresentation? Looking back at the board state provided: \n   Row 3: \". . . T T T T A T .\"\n   So x=3,y=3 is the fourth character (since x=0 is first). So it is 'T'. But whose tail? My tail is at (5,3), enemy tail is at (6,4). So (3,3) is not a tail. Possibly it's an error? But to be safe, we should assume the board state is correct and (3,3) is occupied by a tail. However, from the enemy body list, the last segment is (6,4) (tail). My tail is (5,3). So (3,3) is not in either. Wait, perhaps it's a typo? Actually, the board state says: \n   \"3 . . 0 . T T T A T .\"\n   So at y=3, x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '0' (my head), x=3: '.', x=4: 'T', etc. So (3,3) is actually '.'! The board state has a dot at x=3,y=3. Because the string is: \". . 0 . T T T A T .\" meaning:\n   x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '0', x=3: '.', x=4: 'T', x=5: 'T', x=6: 'T', x=7: 'A', x=8: 'T', x=9: '.'.\n   So (3,3) is safe. Therefore, RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo all moves except DOWN are safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- UP (2,4): Moves toward the apple at (2,6) but enemy head is at (2,6). This is risky because if I move up, enemy might move down to (2,5) and we could collide head-on in future turns. Alternatively, enemy might move away.\n- LEFT (1,3): Moves to the left edge. From there, I can go UP to (1,4) or RIGHT to (2,3) (which will be empty) or DOWN to (1,2) (safe). This avoids immediate conflict but doesn't progress toward apples directly.\n- RIGHT (3,3): Moves toward the center. From (3,3), I can go UP to (3,4), RIGHT to (4,3) (which is my body? Actually (4,3) is in my body), LEFT to (2,3) (empty), or DOWN to (3,2) (my body). So only UP and LEFT would be safe next turn. This is somewhat limiting.\n\nThe apple at (7,3) is also reachable. Moving RIGHT might be a step toward that apple.\n\nEnemy snake head at (2,6) can move:\n- UP: (2,7) - empty\n- DOWN: (2,5) - empty\n- LEFT: (1,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: (3,6) - its own body (first segment), would die.\n\nSo enemy will not move RIGHT. It can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT. If it moves DOWN to (2,5), it gets closer to me. If I move UP to (2,4), we are adjacent vertically. This could lead to a head-on collision if we both continue toward each other.\n\nTo avoid risk, I should not move UP directly toward the enemy. Instead, moving RIGHT to (3,3) is safer and starts to circle toward the apple at (7,3). Also, the apples at (9,1) and (9,0) are on the right edge, but they are far.\n\nLong-term plan: Move right to (3,3), then up to (3,4), and then right toward (7,3). This avoids the enemy at (2,6) and targets a different apple. The enemy might eat the apple at (2,6) and grow, but that's acceptable since we are tied in apples.\n\nRIGHT",

(4,3) is not listed in my body (I have (5,3) but not (4,3)) and enemy has (6,3). So (4,3) is empty? Actually, the board shows 'T' at x=4,y=3. But from the lists, it should be empty. However, to be safe, assume it is occupied. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nWait, let's verify coordinates:\nMy body: last segment is (5,3) (tail). So (4,3) is not in my list.\nEnemy body: includes (6,3) but not (4,3).\nSo (4,3) should be empty. But the board state says at y=3, x=4 is 'T'. This might be a display error? Since the board uses 'T' for any tail, but (4,3) isn't a tail. Perhaps it's a mistake. However, we must trust the board state: if it shows 'T', we treat it as occupied. Therefore, RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nSo only UP is safe.\n\nNow, check if UP (3,4) is truly safe:\n- It is within bounds (0<=x<=9, 0<=y<=9).\n- Not occupied by my body (my body has no segment at (3,4)).\n- Not occupied by enemy body: enemy body has segments at (2,6), (3,6), etc., but not (3,4).\n- Also, no enemy head will be there this turn? Enemy head is at (2,7). It can move UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6) (its own body), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7). So enemy cannot move to (3,4) this turn. Therefore, UP is safe.\n\nSince only UP is safe, I must choose UP.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving to (3,4), I need to avoid getting trapped. From (3,4), I can go UP to (3,5), LEFT to (2,4), or RIGHT to (4,4). DOWN would go back to (3,3) which is now empty? But next turn, my body will have moved, so (3,3) might be safe.

My body: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] (16 segments). Note: my tail is at (5,2).\n\nApples: (6,9), (9,1), (9,0), (7,3), (9,9)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (2,8), body: [(2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2)]\n\nAvailable moves from (3,4):\n- UP: (3,5) - Check board: at y=5, x=3: \". . . . . . . . T T\" (from board state: row 5 has T at x=8 and x=9, so (3,5) is empty). Also, not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n- DOWN: (3,3) - This is my own body (first segment after head). Would die.\n- LEFT: (2,4) - Check: row 4: \". . . 0 . . . . T T\" so (2,4) is '.' (empty). Also, not in my body (my body has (2,3) but not (2,4)) or enemy body (enemy has (2,6), (2,7), (2,8) but not (2,4)). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,4) - Check: row 4: \". . . 0 . . . . T T\" so (4,4) is '.' (empty). Also, not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider enemy movements. Enemy head is at (2,8). It can move:\n- UP: (2,9) - empty? Row 9: \". . . . . . A . . A\" so (2,9) is '.' (safe for enemy).\n- DOWN: (2,7) - its own body (first segment), would die.\n- LEFT: (1,8) - empty? Row 8: \". . 1 . . . . . . .\" so (1,8) is '.' (safe).\n- RIGHT: (3,8) - empty? Row 8: \". . 1 . . . . . . .\" so (3,8) is '.' (safe).\n\nSo enemy can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT without dying.\n\nI should avoid potential head-on collisions. For example, if I move LEFT to (2,4), and enemy moves DOWN? But enemy cannot move DOWN (would die). So no direct collision risk with LEFT. Similarly, RIGHT to (4,4) is safe from enemy head (enemy is at (2,8), far away). UP to (3,5) is also safe.\n\nNow, long-term strategy: I need to collect apples to win. The closest apples are at (7,3) and (9,0)/(9,1). (7,3) is closer. To reach (7,3), I should move right and down. Currently at (3,4), moving RIGHT to (4,4) gets me closer. Then I can go DOWN to (4,3) (which should be empty now? My body has moved, so (3,3) is now my neck, but (4,3) is free? Actually, my body list shows (3,3) is behind me, and (4,3) is not occupied. Similarly, enemy body has (8,3) but not (4,3). So (4,3) is safe next turn if I go RIGHT now.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT opens more space and avoids getting boxed in. LEFT goes towards the wall and my own body, which might limit options. UP goes away from the apple.\n\nSo RIGHT seems best.\n\nBut let's check future safety: From (4,4), next moves could be DOWN (to (4,3)), RIGHT (to (5,4)), or UP (to (4,5)). All should be safe? (4,3) is empty, (5,4) is empty (row 4: ...), (4,5) is empty (row 5: ...). So multiple options.\n\nTherefore, choose RIGHT to move towards the apple at (7,3) and maintain flexibility.\n\nPlan for next turns: Head towards (7,3) via right and down moves, while avoiding enemy. Enemy is long and might block paths, so be cautious.\n\nRIGHT",

Tail is at (4,2).\n\nApples: (6,9), (9,1), (9,0), (7,3), (9,9)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (2,9), body: [(2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]\n\nAvailable moves from (4,4):\n- UP: (4,5) - Check board: row 5: \". . . . . . . . T T\" so (4,5) is empty. Not in my body (my body has y=5? Only (6,0) etc., no (4,5)) or enemy body (enemy has y=5 at (7,5), (8,5), (9,5)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,3) - Check: row 3: \". . T T . . . A T .\" so (4,3) is '.' (empty). Not in my body (my body has (3,3) and (2,3) but not (4,3)) or enemy body (enemy has (8,3) but not (4,3)). Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,4) - This is my own body (first segment after head). Would die.\n- RIGHT: (5,4) - Check: row 4: \". . . T 0 . . . T T\" so (5,4) is '.' (empty). Not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider enemy movements. Enemy head is at (2,9). It can move:\n- UP: (2,10) - off board (y=10 doesn't exist), would die.\n- DOWN: (2,8) - its own body (first segment), would die.\n- LEFT: (1,9) - empty? Row 9: \". . 1 . . . A . . A\" so (1,9) is '.' (safe).\n- RIGHT: (3,9) - empty? Row 9: \". . 1 . . . A . . A\" so (3,9) is '.' (safe).\n\nSo enemy can only move LEFT or RIGHT without dying.\n\nI should avoid potential head-on collisions. For example, if I move RIGHT to (5,4), enemy is far away at (2,9) and moving horizontally, so no immediate collision risk. Similarly for UP and DOWN.\n\nLong-term strategy: The closest apple is at (7,3). To reach it, I should move DOWN and RIGHT. Moving DOWN to (4,3) gets me closer to (7,3) (distance: |4-7| + |3-3| = 3) than staying at (4,4) (distance: |4-7| + |4-3| = 4). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) also gets closer (distance: |5-7| + |4-3| = 3). UP moves away.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are good. However, moving DOWN to (4,3) might be slightly better because it reduces the y-coordinate difference to zero. Also, from (4,3), I can go RIGHT to (5,3) or further DOWN to (4,2) (but (4,2) is my tail? Actually, my tail is at (4,2), but next turn when I move, my tail will move too? Actually, when I move without eating, my tail moves forward. So if I move DOWN to (4,3), my tail (currently at (4,2)) will become (3,4)? Wait, let's simulate: if I move DOWN, head goes to (4,3), and the body shifts: the segment at (3,4) becomes the new neck, and the tail (4,2) is removed? Actually, no: since I didn't eat an apple, the tail moves: the last segment (tail) is removed. So after moving DOWN, my body becomes: head at (4,3), then (4,4) [which was head], then (3,4), (3,3), ... and the tail (4,2) is gone. So (4,2) becomes free.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,3) is safe and efficient for reaching (7,3). Also, it avoids potential future conflicts with the enemy who is in the top rows.\n\nCheck follow-up moves from (4,3):\n- DOWN: (4,2) - will be free (my tail moves away).\n- LEFT: (3,3) - my body? After move, (3,3) is still in my body (third segment).\n- RIGHT: (5,3) - empty.\nSo from (4,3), I can go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,4) (if I go RIGHT), I can go DOWN to (5,3) or RIGHT to (6,4), etc.\n\nBoth are good, but DOWN directly reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (7,3) is in row 3, so moving DOWN gets me to the same row.\n\nTherefore, choose DOWN.\n\nPlan for next turns: Head towards (7,3) via right and down moves. After reaching (4,3), next move RIGHT to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3). Be cautious of enemy body parts (e.g., (7,2) is enemy body, so avoid that).\n\nDOWN",

My body: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] (16 segments). Tail is at (3,2).\n\nApples: (6,9), (9,1), (9,0), (7,3), (9,9)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (3,9), body: [(2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]\n\nAvailable moves from (4,3):\n- UP: (4,4) - This is my own body (first segment after head). Would die.\n- DOWN: (4,2) - Check board: row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\" so (4,2) is '.' (empty). Not in my body (my body has (3,2) but not (4,2)) or enemy body (enemy has (8,2) but not (4,2)). Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,3) - This is my own body (third segment). Would die.\n- RIGHT: (5,3) - Check: row 3: \". . T T 0 . . A T .\" so (5,3) is '.' (empty). Not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider enemy movements. Enemy head is at (3,9). It can move:\n- UP: (3,10) - off board, would die.\n- DOWN: (3,8) - empty? Row 8: \". . T . . . . . . .\" so (3,8) is '.' (safe).\n- LEFT: (2,9) - its own body (first segment), would die.\n- RIGHT: (4,9) - empty? Row 9: \". . T 1 . . A . . A\" so (4,9) is '.' (safe).\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN or RIGHT without dying.\n\nI should avoid potential head-on collisions. The enemy is far away (at (3,9)), so no immediate risk.\n\nLong-term strategy: The closest apple is at (7,3). To reach it, I should move RIGHT. Moving RIGHT to (5,3) reduces the distance to (7,3) from |4-7| + |3-3| = 3 to |5-7| + |3-3| = 2. Moving DOWN to (4,2) increases the distance (|4-7| + |2-3| = 4).\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is better for reaching the apple.\n\nAlso, from (5,3), I can continue RIGHT to (6,3) and then (7,3). Be cautious of enemy body at (8,3) and (8,2), but (7,3) is safe.\n\nCheck follow-up moves from (5,3):\n- UP: (5,4) - empty (row 4: \". . . T T . . . T T\", so (5,4) is '.').\n- DOWN: (5,2) - empty (row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\", so (5,2) is '.').\n- LEFT: (4,3) - would be my body? After moving, my body will be: head at (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), ... so (4,3) is my neck. Not safe to go back.\n- RIGHT: (6,3) - empty (row 3: \". . T T 0 . . A T .\", so (6,3) is '.').\n\nSo from (5,3), I have UP, DOWN, RIGHT available (three safe moves), which is good for flexibility.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,2) also has follow-up moves: DOWN to (4,1) (my body? After move, (4,1) is in my body (14th segment)), LEFT to (3,2) (my body, 16th segment), RIGHT to (5,2) (empty). So only RIGHT is safe from (4,2), which is restrictive.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is better for both apple acquisition and future flexibility.\n\nPlan for next turns: Move RIGHT to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. Avoid moving into enemy body parts (e.g., (8,3) and (8,2)). After eating, consider moving towards other apples or open spaces.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nMy head is at (5,3). My body: [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] (16 segments). Tail is at (3,1).\n\nApples: (6,9), (9,1), (9,0), (7,3), (9,9)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (4,9), body: [(3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,3)]\n\nAvailable moves from (5,3):\n- UP: (5,4) - Check board: row 4: \". . . T T . . . T T\" so (5,4) is '.' (empty). Not in my body (my body has (4,4) but not (5,4)) or enemy body (enemy has no (5,4)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,2) - Check row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\" so (5,2) is '.' (empty). Not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,3) - This is my own body (first segment after head). Would die.\n- RIGHT: (6,3) - Check row 3: \". . T T 0 . . A T .\" so (6,3) is '.' (empty). Not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider enemy movements. Enemy head is at (4,9). It can move:\n- UP: (4,10) - off board, would die.\n- DOWN: (4,8) - empty? Row 8: \". . T . . . . . . .\" so (4,8) is '.' (safe).\n- LEFT: (3,9) - its own body (first segment), would die.\n- RIGHT: (5,9) - empty? Row 9: \". . T 1 . . A . . A\" so (5,9) is '.' (safe).\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN or RIGHT without dying. The enemy is far away (at (4,9)), so no immediate risk.\n\nLong-term strategy: The closest apple is at (7,3). Moving RIGHT to (6,3) reduces the distance to (7,3) from |5-7| + |3-3| = 2 to |6-7| + |3-3| = 1. Moving UP or DOWN would increase the distance.\n\nAlso, from (6,3), I can move RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. Be cautious of enemy body at (8,3), but (7,3) is safe.\n\nCheck follow-up moves from (6,3):\n- UP: (6,4) - empty (row 4: \". . . T T . . . T T\", so (6,4) is '.').\n- DOWN: (6,2) - empty (row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\", so (6,2) is '.').\n- LEFT: (5,3) - would be my body? After moving, my body will be: head at (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), ... so (5,3) is my neck. Not safe to go back.\n- RIGHT: (7,3) - apple! Safe (not in any body).\n\nSo from (6,3), I have UP, DOWN, RIGHT available (three safe moves), which is good.\n\nMoving UP to (5,4) or DOWN to (5,2) would not help as much for the apple and might lead to fewer options.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is best for apple acquisition and future flexibility.\n\nPlan for next turns: Move RIGHT to (6,3), then RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple. After that, consider moving towards other apples (e.g., (9,0) or (9,1)) or open spaces. Avoid enemy body parts (e.g., (8,3)).\n\nRIGHT",

T T . . . T T\" so (6,4) is '.' (empty). Not in my body (my body has no (6,4)) or enemy body (enemy has no (6,4)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,2) - Check row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\" so (6,2) is '.' (empty).

Safe to eat.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider enemy movements. Enemy head is at (5,9). It can move:\n- UP: (5,10) - off board, would die.\n- DOWN: (5,8) - empty? Row 8: \". . T . . . . . . .\" so (5,8) is '.' (safe).\n- LEFT: (4,9) - its own body (first segment), would die.\n- RIGHT: (6,9) - apple? Row 9: \". . T T 1 A . . A\" so (6,9) is apple (safe). Also, enemy might go for it.\n\nThe enemy is far away (at (5,9)), so no immediate risk to me.\n\nThe closest apple is at (7,3). Moving RIGHT to (7,3) would eat it immediately. This is highly beneficial: I gain an apple and grow by one segment. After eating, my head will be at (7,3), and my body will extend (so the tail doesn't move this turn). Then I'll have 17 segments.\n\nMoving UP or DOWN would not get me closer to an apple as effectively.\n\nCheck follow-up moves after eating the apple at (7,3):\n- From (7,3), I can move UP to (7,4) - empty (row 4: \". . . T T . . . T T\", so (7,4) is '.').\n- DOWN to (7,2) - empty (row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\", so (7,2) is '.').\n- LEFT to (6,3) - would be my body (neck) after move? After eating, my body becomes: head at (7,3), then (6,3), (5,3), ... so (6,3) is my neck. Not safe.\n- RIGHT to (8,3) - enemy body? Enemy has (8,4) but not (8,3). Row 3: \". . T T T T 0 A . .\" so (8,3) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n\nSo after eating, I have UP, DOWN, RIGHT available (three safe moves). Good flexibility.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to get the apple and maintain options.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (7,3), consider moving towards the bottom-right apples (e.g., (9,0) or (9,1)) or top apples (e.g., (6,9) or (9,9)). Avoid enemy body (especially near (8,4) and (8,3) might be risky if enemy moves there). Also, be aware that enemy might be going for (6,9) apple.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nMy head is at (7,3) after moving RIGHT last turn and eating the apple at (7,3). My body now has 18 segments: head at (7,3), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). Tail is at (4,1).\n\nApples: (9,1), (9,0), (9,9), (1,9), (6,7) \u2014 note (7,3) is gone.\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (6,9), body: [(5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4)] (18 segments). Tail at (8,4).\n\nAvailable moves from (7,3):\n- UP: (7,4) \u2014 Check board: row 4: \". . . T T . . . T T\" so (7,4) is '.' (empty). Not in my body (my body has no (7,4)) or enemy body (enemy has no (7,4)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (7,2) \u2014 Check row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\" so (7,2) is '.' (empty). Not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,3) \u2014 This is my own body (neck). Would die.\n- RIGHT: (8,3) \u2014 Check row 3: \". . T T T T 0 A . .\" so (8,3) is '.' (empty). Not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider enemy movements. Enemy head is at (6,9). It can move:\n- UP: (6,10) \u2014 off board, would die.\n- DOWN: (6,8) \u2014 empty? Row 8: \". . T . . . . . . .\" so (6,8) is '.' (safe).\n- LEFT: (5,9) \u2014 its own body (neck), would die.\n- RIGHT: (7,9) \u2014 empty? Row 9: \". . T T 1 A . . A\" so (7,9) is '.' (safe). Also, there is an apple at (9,9) and (1,9), but (6,7) is closer.\n\nThe enemy is far away (top-right), so no immediate risk to me.\n\nApples: The closest apple is at (6,7) \u2014 only 4 steps away (Manhattan distance: |7-6| + |3-7| = 1+4=5? Actually: head (7,3) to (6,7): dx=1, dy=4, total 5). Also (9,0) and (9,1) are 7-8 steps away.\n\nMoving UP to (7,4) gets me closer to (6,7): from (7,4) to (6,7) is dx=1, dy=3 (total 4).\nMoving RIGHT to (8,3) doesn't help much for (6,7).\nMoving DOWN to (7,2) moves away.\n\nSo UP is best for reaching (6,7). Also, after UP to (7,4), I can consider next moves:\n- From (7,4): UP to (7,5) \u2014 check enemy body: enemy has (7,5)? Enemy body has (7,5) (from list: (7,5) is present). So not safe. Also (7,5) is enemy body? Actually enemy body: [(5,9), (4,9), ... (7,6), (7,5), ...] so (7,5) is enemy body. So UP from (7,4) would be dangerous.\n- LEFT to (6,4) \u2014 empty? Row 4: \". . . T T . . . T T\" so (6,4) is '.' (safe).\n- RIGHT to (8,4) \u2014 enemy tail? Enemy tail is at (8,4). But if enemy moves, it might leave. However, currently (8,4) is enemy body. So not safe.\n- DOWN to (7,3) \u2014 my neck? After moving, my neck would be (7,3) which is my head now, so it becomes body. Not safe.\n\nSo from (7,4), only LEFT is safe (to (6,4)). That is restrictive.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,3):\n- From (8,3): UP to (8,4) \u2014 enemy tail? Currently (8,4) is enemy body. But enemy might move away. However, if enemy moves DOWN to (6,8) or RIGHT to (7,9), (8,4) might become free? But risky.\n- DOWN to (8,2) \u2014 empty? Row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\" so (8,2) is '.' (safe).\n- LEFT to (7,3) \u2014 my neck, not safe.\n- RIGHT to (9,3) \u2014 empty? Row 3: \". . T T T T 0 A . .\" so (9,3) is '.' (safe).\n\nSo from (8,3), UP is risky (enemy body), but DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7,2):\n- From (7,2): UP to (7,3) \u2014 neck, not safe.\n- DOWN to (7,1) \u2014 empty? Row 1: \". . T . T T T . . A\" so (7,1) is '.' (safe).\n- LEFT to (6,2) \u2014 empty? Row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\" so (6,2) is '.' (safe).\n- RIGHT to (8,2) \u2014 empty (same row 2).\n\nSo from (7,2), three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nLong-term: I should aim for the apple at (6,7). But moving UP to (7,4) only leaves LEFT as safe next move (to (6,4)), which is okay but then from (6,4) I can go UP to (6,5) (empty? Row 5: \". . . . . . . T T T\" so (6,5) is '.'), then (6,6) (enemy body? Enemy has (6,6)), so avoid. Alternatively, from (6,4) go LEFT to (5,4) (empty) etc.\n\nBut enemy is near (6,7) apple? Enemy head at (6,9) might go for (6,7) via DOWN to (6,8) then LEFT to (6,7)? Or RIGHT to (7,9) then DOWN? So competition.\n\nGiven that, and to keep options open, moving DOWN to (7,2) gives more flexibility (three safe moves) and avoids immediate risk. Then I can loop around to the bottom apples (9,0) or (9,1) which are also close.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (7,2) to maintain flexibility and head towards bottom apples. Then next turn, consider moving RIGHT to (8,2) or DOWN to (7,1) to approach (9,0) or (9,1). Avoid enemy territory top-right for now.\n\nDOWN",

Row 8: \". . T . . . 1 . . .\" so (5,8) is '.' (safe).\n- RIGHT: (7,8) \u2014 empty? Row 8: \". . T . . . 1 . . .\" so (7,8) is '.' (safe).\n\nThe enemy is likely to go for the apple at (6,7) via DOWN. That would put its head at (6,7) next turn.\n\nApples: The closest apple is (6,7) \u2014 only 5 steps away (Manhattan: |7-6| + |2-7| = 1+5=6? Actually head (7,2) to (6,7): dx=1, dy=5, total 6). Also (9,0) and (9,1) are 7-8 steps away.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7,1) gets me closer to (9,0) and (9,1): from (7,1) to (9,0) is dx=2, dy=1 (total 3).\nMoving LEFT to (6,2) doesn't help much for any apple.\nMoving RIGHT to (8,2) gets me closer to (9,0) and (9,1): from (8,2) to (9,0) is dx=1, dy=2 (total 3).\n\nAlso, (6,7) is being targeted by the enemy, so it might be risky to go for it.\n\nNow, check follow-up moves:\n\nFrom (7,1):\n- UP: (7,2) \u2014 neck, not safe.\n- DOWN: (7,0) \u2014 empty? Row 0: \". . T T T T T . . A\" so (7,0) is '.' (safe).\n- LEFT: (6,1) \u2014 empty? Row 1: \". . T . . T T . . A\" so (6,1) is '.' (safe).\n- RIGHT: (8,1) \u2014 empty? Row 1: \". . T . . T T . . A\" so (8,1) is '.' (safe).\n\nSo three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nFrom (8,2):\n- UP: (8,3) \u2014 empty? Row 3: \". . T T T T 0 A . .\" so (8,3) is '.' (safe).\n- DOWN: (8,1) \u2014 empty (as above).\n- LEFT: (7,2) \u2014 neck, not safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,2) \u2014 empty? Row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\" so (9,2) is '.' (safe).\n\nSo three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nFrom (6,2):\n- UP: (6,3) \u2014 my body, would die.\n- DOWN: (6,1) \u2014 empty (safe).\n- LEFT: (5,2) \u2014 empty? Row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\" so (5,2) is '.' (safe).\n- RIGHT: (7,2) \u2014 neck, not safe.\n\nSo two safe moves (DOWN, LEFT).\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,2) or DOWN to (7,1) gives more options than LEFT (6,2).\n\nLong-term: I should aim for the bottom apples (9,0) and (9,1) which are uncontested. The enemy is going for (6,7), so avoid that area. Moving RIGHT to (8,2) is better for reaching (9,0) and (9,1) quickly.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (8,2) to approach the bottom apples. Then next turn, consider moving DOWN to (8,1) or RIGHT to (9,2) to get closer. Avoid the enemy near (6,7).\n\nRIGHT",

My body: [(7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1)] (17 segments). Tail is at (6,1).\n\nApples: (9,1), (9,0), (9,9), (1,9), (7,9) \u2014 note: (6,7) is gone? Actually, last turn there was an apple at (6,7), but enemy snake #1 might have eaten it? Wait, in the current state, apples are listed as (9,1), (9,0), (9,9), (1,9), (7,9). So (6,7) is no longer an apple.\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (6,7), body: [(6,8), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4)] (18 segments, since it ate an apple). Tail at (9,4).\n\nAvailable moves from (8,2):\n- UP: (8,3) \u2014 Check board: row 3: \". . T T T T T T . .\" so (8,3) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,1) \u2014 Check row 1: \". . T . . . T . .

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider enemy movements. Enemy head is at (6,7). It can move:\n- UP: (6,8) \u2014 its own body (neck), would die.\n- DOWN: (6,6) \u2014 its own body? Row 6: \". . T T T T T T . .\" so (6,6) is 'T' (enemy body). Would die.\n- LEFT: (5,7) \u2014 empty? Row 7: \". . T . . . 1 . . .\" so (5,7) is '.' (safe).\n- RIGHT: (7,7) \u2014 empty? Row 7: \". . T . . . 1 . . .\" so (7,7) is '.' (safe).\n\nSo enemy safe moves: LEFT to (5,7) or RIGHT to (7,7).\n\nThe enemy might go for apples? Apples at (7,9) and (1,9) are far. (7,9) is closer: from (6,7) to (7,9) is dx=1, dy=2 (total 3). But moving RIGHT to (7,7) doesn't help directly. Alternatively, it might go LEFT to (5,7) to approach (1,9) or (7,9)? Actually, (7,9) is above and right.\n\nBut note: enemy has many segments and might be constrained.\n\nNow, my goal: I need to catch up in apples (17 vs 18). The closest apples are (9,0) and (9,1). From (8,2):\n- To (9,0): dx=1, dy=2 (total 3)\n- To (9,1): dx=1, dy=1 (total 2)\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (9,2) gets me closer to both: from (9,2) to (9,1) is DOWN (1 step), to (9,0) is DOWN twice (2 steps).\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,1) also gets closer: to (9,0) is RIGHT and DOWN? Actually from (8,1) to (9,0) is dx=1, dy=1 (total 2), to (9,1) is dx=1, dy=0 (total 1).\n\nMoving UP to (8,3) doesn't help for these apples.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are good for apples.\n\nNow, check follow-up moves:\n\nFrom (9,2):\n- UP: (9,3) \u2014 empty? Row 3: \". . T T T T T T . .\" so (9,3) is '.' (safe).\n- DOWN: (9,1) \u2014 apple! Would eat and grow.\n- LEFT: (8,2) \u2014 neck, not safe.\n- RIGHT: off board (x=10) \u2014 would die.\n\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe. But DOWN leads to apple.\n\nFrom (8,1):\n- UP: (8,2) \u2014 neck, not safe.\n- DOWN: (8,0) \u2014 empty? Row 0: \". . T T T T T . . A\" so (8,0) is '.' (safe).\n- LEFT: (7,1) \u2014 empty? Row 1: \". . T . . . T . . A\" so (7,1) is '.' (safe).\n- RIGHT: (9,1) \u2014 apple! Would eat.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (with RIGHT leading to apple).\n\nFrom (8,3):\n- UP: (8,4) \u2014 empty? Row 4: \". . . T T . . . . T\" so (8,4) is '.' (safe).\n- DOWN: (8,2) \u2014 neck, not safe.\n- LEFT: (7,3) \u2014 my body, would die.\n- RIGHT: (9,3) \u2014 empty (safe).\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (8,1) gives three safe moves next turn (including an apple capture), while RIGHT to (9,2) gives two safe moves (and an apple capture via DOWN). Moving UP to (8,3) gives two safe moves but no immediate apple.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are both good, but DOWN to (8,1) has more options next turn.\n\nAlso, enemy is at (6,7) and might move to (7,7) or (5,7), which is far from me. No immediate collision risk.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (8,1) to get closer to the apples (9,0) and (9,1). Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (9,1) to eat an apple, or LEFT/DOWN to explore. This also avoids potential dead-end at (9,2) which has only two exits.\n\nLong-term: After eating the bottom apples, consider going for (7,9) or (9,9) if safe. Avoid enemy which is long and might block paths.\n\nDOWN",

My body: [(8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0)] (17 segments). Tail is at (6,0).\n\nApples: (9,1), (9,0), (9,9), (1,9), (7,9)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (7,7), body: [(6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5)] (18 segments). Tail at (9,5).\n\nAvailable moves from (8,1):\n- UP: (8,2) \u2014 my own body (neck), would die.\n- DOWN: (8,0) \u2014 Check row 0: \". . T T T T T . . A\" so (8,0) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,1) \u2014 Check row 1: \". . T . . . T . . A\" so (7,1) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,1) \u2014 apple! Would eat and grow. Also, check: row 1 ends with \"A\", so (9,1) is apple. Safe to move into (since it's not a body).\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT leads directly to an apple at (9,1), which would give me 18 apples (tying with enemy). This is highly beneficial.\n\nNow, consider enemy movements. Enemy head is at (7,7). It can move:\n- UP: (7,8) \u2014 Check row 8: \". . T . . . T . . .\" so (7,8) is '.' (safe).\n- DOWN: (7,6) \u2014 its own body? Row 6: \". . T T T T T T . .\" so (7,6) is 'T' (enemy body). Would die.\n- LEFT: (6,7) \u2014 its own body? Row 7: \". . T . . . 1 . . .\" so (6,7) is 'T' (enemy body). Would die.\n- RIGHT: (8,7) \u2014 empty? Row 7: ends with \". .\", so (8,7) is '.' (safe).\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,7).\n\nThe enemy might go for apples? (7,9) is close: from (7,7) to (7,9) is UP twice. Moving UP to (7,8) gets closer. Also (9,9) is far.\n\nBut enemy is far from me (at (7,7) vs my (8,1)), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nNow, my moves:\n- RIGHT: (9,1) \u2014 eat apple, grow. Then next turn, from (9,1):\n  - UP: (9,2) \u2014 empty? Row 2: \". . T T . . . . T .\" so (9,2) is '.' (safe).\n  - DOWN: (9,0) \u2014 apple! Would eat and grow.\n  - LEFT: (8,1) \u2014 neck (since I just moved right, my body extends to (8,1) as neck? Actually after eating, my head moves to (9,1) and new segment added at tail, so neck is still (8,1) which is body. So LEFT would die.\n  - RIGHT: off board (x=10) \u2014 die.\n  So only UP and DOWN safe. But DOWN leads to another apple.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (9,1) gives two safe moves next turn (both leading to apples: DOWN to (9,0) or UP to (9,2) which is safe but no apple).\n\n- DOWN: (8,0) \u2014 empty. Then next turn, from (8,0):\n  - UP: (8,1) \u2014 neck, would die.\n  - DOWN: off board (y=-1) \u2014 die.\n  - LEFT: (7,0) \u2014 empty? Row 0: \". . T T T T T . . A\" so (7,0) is '.' (safe).\n  - RIGHT: (9,0) \u2014 apple! Would eat.\n  So safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT (RIGHT to apple).\n\n- LEFT: (7,1) \u2014 empty. Then next turn, from (7,1):\n  - UP: (7,2) \u2014 my body, would die.\n  - DOWN: (7,0) \u2014 empty (safe).\n  - LEFT: (6,1) \u2014 empty? Row 1: \". . T . . . T . . A\" so (6,1) is '.' (safe).\n  - RIGHT: (8,1) \u2014 neck, would die.\n  So safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nSo RIGHT is the best because it immediately eats an apple (tying the score) and sets up for another apple next turn (DOWN to (9,0)). Also, it has the shortest path to multiple apples.\n\nLong-term: After eating (9,1) and (9,0), consider going for (7,9) or (9,9). Avoid enemy which is moving north. I might need to loop around to avoid getting trapped.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to eat (9,1). Next turn, move DOWN to (9,0) to eat another apple (reaching 19). Then evaluate paths to other apples (7,9) or (9,9) while avoiding enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- LEFT: (8,1) \u2014 my own body (neck), would die.\n- RIGHT: off board (x=10) \u2014 die.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and DOWN. DOWN leads directly to an apple.\n\nNow, consider enemy movements. Enemy head at (7,8). It can move:\n- UP: (7,9) \u2014 apple! Row 9: \". A T T T T T A . A\" so (7,9) is 'A' (apple). Safe.\n- DOWN: (7,7) \u2014 its own body? Row 7: \". . T . . . T T . .\" so (7,7) is 'T' (enemy body). Would die.\n- LEFT: (6,8) \u2014 its own body? Row 8: \". . T . . . T . . .\" so (6,8) is 'T' (enemy body). Would die.\n- RIGHT: (8,8) \u2014 empty? Row 8: ends with \". .\", so (8,8) is '.' (safe).\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP to (7,9) (apple) or RIGHT to (8,8).\n\nThe enemy is likely to go UP to (7,9) to eat the apple (tying at 19 apples). That would put enemy head at (7,9).\n\nNow, my moves:\n- DOWN: (9,0) \u2014 eat apple, grow to 20 apples. Then next turn, from (9,0):\n  - UP: (9,1) \u2014 my body (neck), would die.\n  - DOWN: off board (y=-1) \u2014 die.\n  - LEFT: (8,0) \u2014 empty? Row 0: \". . T T T T T . . A\" so (8,0) is '.' (safe).\n  - RIGHT: off board (x=10) \u2014 die.\n  So only LEFT safe.\n\n- UP: (9,2) \u2014 empty. Then next turn, from (9,2):\n  - UP: (9,3) \u2014 empty? Row 3: \". . T T T T T T . .\" so (9,3) is '.' (safe).\n  - DOWN: (9,1) \u2014 neck, would die.\n  - LEFT: (8,2) \u2014 my body, would die.\n  - RIGHT: off board \u2014 die.\n  So only UP safe.\n\nSo DOWN gives immediate apple (20 apples) but leaves only one safe move next turn (LEFT to (8,0)). UP gives no apple but leaves one safe move (UP to (9,3)).\n\nGiven that eating an apple is beneficial (and I lead 20 vs enemy 18 or 19), DOWN is better. Also, after eating (9,0), I can move LEFT to (8,0) and then plan to go down or left to avoid being trapped.\n\nLong-term: After eating (9,0), I need to escape the corner. From (8,0), I can go LEFT to (7,0) (safe) and then down or left. Alternatively, consider going for other apples like (7,9) or (9,9) but enemy might be there.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to eat (9,0) and get to 20 apples. Next turn, move LEFT to (8,0). Then evaluate paths to avoid enemy and possibly loop back to center.\n\nDOWN",

My body has grown: the tail hasn't moved yet, so my body includes the previous head position (9,0) and the new segment from eating.\n\nApples remaining: (9,9), (1,9), (3,1), (2,5), (2,4) \u2014 note (2,4) is also an apple? Wait, the apples listed are (9,9), (1,9), (3,1), (2,5), (2,4). So (2,4) is an apple.\n\nEnemy snake #1 has head at (8,9) (since it moved RIGHT to eat the apple at (8,9)? Actually, last turn it was at (7,9) and moved UP to (7,9)? Wait, let's check: last turn enemy head was at (8,9) according to the board? Actually, from the board state row 9: \". A T T T T T T 1 A\" so (8,9) is '1' (enemy head). So enemy head is at (8,9). It has 19 apples? But last rationale said it ate and has 20? Wait, scores: snake #1 has 19 apples? Actually, scores say \"Snake #1 apples: 19\", so it has 19. It did not eat last turn? Because (8,9) is an apple? But it is at (8,9), so it should have eaten it. There might be a discrepancy.\n\nFrom the board state:\nRow 9: \". A T T T T T T 1 A\" \u2014 so (8,9) is '1' (enemy head) and (9,9) is 'A' (apple). So enemy did not eat (8,9) because it was already there? Or perhaps it moved to (8,9) and ate? Actually, the board state is after the moves? Let's reconstruct.\n\nLast turn:\n- My head was at (9,0), I moved LEFT to (8,0) and ate the apple there.\n- Enemy head was at (7,9)? Actually, from last rationale: enemy head was at (7,9) and moved UP to (7,9)? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, from the board state row 9: (8,9) is enemy head, so it might have moved RIGHT from (7,9) to (8,9) and eaten the apple? But (8,9) is an apple? The apples listed include (9,9) and (1,9), but not (8,9). So (8,9) was not an apple? Wait, apples at: (9,9), (1,9), (3,1), (2,5), (2,4). So (8,9) is not an apple. So enemy moved to (8,9) without eating.\n\nTherefore, enemy snake #1 has 19 apples (not grown) and head at (8,9).\n\nNow, my head at (8,0):\n- UP: (8,1) \u2014 my body? Row 1: \". . T A . . . . T T\" so (8,1) is 'T' (my body) \u2014 die.\n- DOWN: off board (y=-1) \u2014 die.\n- LEFT: (7,0) \u2014 empty? Row 0: \". . T T T T T . . A\" so (7,0) is '.' (safe).\n- RIGHT: (9,0) \u2014 my body? Row 0: ends with \"A 0\", but (9,0) is now my body (since I moved away) \u2014 die.\n\nSo only safe move: LEFT to (7,0).\n\nNext turn from (7,0):\n- UP: (7,1) \u2014 empty? Row 1: (7,1) is '.' (safe).\n- DOWN: off board \u2014 die.\n- LEFT: (6,0) \u2014 empty? Row 0: (6,0) is 'T' (my body) \u2014 die.\n- RIGHT: (8,0) \u2014 my body \u2014 die.\n\nSo only UP safe next turn.\n\nTherefore, I must go LEFT to (7,0) now. Then next turn, only UP to (7,1) is safe.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving to (7,0), then to (7,1), I need to escape the bottom-left corner. I should aim to go upwards and leftwards to avoid the enemy and target apples like (3,1) or (2,4)/(2,5). The enemy is at (8,9) with 19 apples, so I have a lead. I should avoid head-on collisions and try to survive while collecting apples.\n\nLEFT",

Dies.\n\nSo only UP is safe this turn.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake #1 at (9,9). It has many options and is far away. It might be heading towards apples like (1,9) or (9,7). But since I'm at the bottom left, I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nAfter moving UP to (7,1), I need to plan next moves:\n- From (7,1): UP to (7,2) is my body? Row2: (7,2) is 'T' (my body) - not safe. DOWN to (7,0) is my body? Row0: (7,0) is now my head? Actually, after I move, my head will be at (7,1), so (7,0) becomes part of my body. So DOWN would be into my body. LEFT to (6,1) - currently empty? Row1: (6,1) is '.'? Actually row1: \". . T A . . . . T T\" so (6,1) is '.'? Wait, columns: 0 to 9. Row1: col0: '.', col1: '.', col2: 'T', col3: 'A', col4: '.', col5: '.', col6: '.', col7: '.', col8: 'T', col9: 'T'. So (6,1) is '.' (safe). RIGHT to (8,1) - row1: (8,1) is 'T' (my body) - not safe.\n\nSo from (7,1), only LEFT (to (6,1)) is safe next turn? But wait, I should check the board after I move. Actually, when I move to (7,1), my body will extend to include (7,0) as the new segment? No: I didn't eat an apple this turn, so I don't grow. My tail will move forward. So my body will be: head at (7,1), then (7,0), then (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), ... etc. So (7,0) becomes the segment behind the head.\n\nTherefore, from (7,1):\n- UP: (7,2) - my body (from previous state: (7,2) is in my body list) - dies.\n- DOWN: (7,0) - my body (just behind head) - dies.\n- LEFT: (6,1) - empty (safe).\n- RIGHT: (8,1) - my body (from list: (8,1)) - dies.\n\nSo only LEFT is safe next turn.\n\nTherefore, I must go UP now to (7,1), then LEFT to (6,1) next turn.\n\nLong-term plan: After (7,1) and (6,1), I should continue leftwards and upwards to avoid the crowded bottom-left. I can aim for apples at (3,1) or (2,4)/(2,5). The enemy is at (9,9) and might be going for (1,9) or (9,7). I should avoid the top-right area.

Dies.\n\nSo only LEFT is safe this turn.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake #1 at (9,8). It might move towards apples (9,7) or (1,9). It is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (6,1), I need to plan next moves:\n- From (6,1): \n  - UP: (6,2) - Row2, col6 is '.' (empty) - safe.\n  - DOWN: (6,0) - Row0, col6 is 'T' (my body) - dies.\n  - LEFT: (5,1) - Row1, col5 is '.' (empty) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (7,1) - Row1, col7 is now my head? Actually, after I move, my head will be at (6,1), so (7,1) becomes part of my body. So RIGHT would be into my body - dies.\n\nSo from (6,1), UP and LEFT are safe next turn.\n\nLong-term plan: I should aim to move towards the apples at (3,1) or (2,4)/(2,5). From (6,1), going LEFT to (5,1) then (4,1) etc. would lead me to (3,1). Alternatively, going UP to (6,2) then further up might lead to (2,4) or (2,5). I should avoid the enemy in the top-right. My path should be cautious: since my body is long, I need to avoid looping back into myself. Moving leftwards seems promising to get to (3,1) safely.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nMy head is at (6,1). From here:\n- UP: (6,2) - Check board: row2, col6 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,0) - Row0, col6 is 'T' (my body). Dies.\n- LEFT: (5,1) - Row1, col5 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,1) - Row1, col7 is 'T' (my body). Dies.\n\nSo only UP and LEFT are safe this turn.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake #1 at (8,8). It might move towards apples (9,7) or (1,9). It is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nApples: (1,9) is far and near enemy territory, (3,1) is close and reachable, (2,5) and (2,4) are also nearby. (9,7) is near the enemy.\n\nFrom (6,1), moving LEFT to (5,1) gets me closer to (3,1) and (2,4)/(2,5). Moving UP to (6,2) also leads towards (2,4)/(2,5) but might be a longer path.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (5,1):\n- Next moves: UP (5,2) is '.' (safe), DOWN (5,0) is '.' (safe), LEFT (4,1) is '.' (safe), RIGHT (6,1) is now my head? Actually, after moving, my head is at (5,1), so (6,1) becomes body? Wait, my body list: current head (6,1) moves to (5,1), so the old head becomes the new first body segment. So (6,1) is now body. So from (5,1), RIGHT would be into my body - dies.\nSo from (5,1), safe moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nAfter moving UP to (6,2):\n- Next moves: UP (6,3) is 'T' (my body) - dies, DOWN (6,1) is now body? Actually, after moving UP, head is at (6,2), so (6,1) becomes body. So DOWN is into body - dies. LEFT (5,2) is '.' (safe), RIGHT (7,2) is 'T' (my body) - dies.\nSo from (6,2), only LEFT is safe next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (5,1) gives more options next turn (3 safe moves) while moving UP to (6,2) gives only one safe move (LEFT). So LEFT is better for keeping options open.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT directly towards (3,1) is efficient. I should prioritize getting that apple.\n\nLong-term plan: Move leftwards to (3,1) first, then consider going up to (2,4) or (2,5). Avoid the enemy in the top-right. My body is long, so I need to be careful not to trap myself. Moving left seems safe and opens more paths.\n\nLEFT",
