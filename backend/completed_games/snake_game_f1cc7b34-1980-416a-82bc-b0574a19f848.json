I need to identify the closest apple and move towards it efficiently while maintaining safety.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Apple Distances:**\n    *   To getting apple at (4, 4): My distance is $|5-4| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4$. Enemy distance is $|9-4| + |4-4| = 5$. I am closer.\n    *   To apple at (8, 5): My distance is $|5-8| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7$. Enemy distance is $|9-8| + |4-5| = 2$. Enemy is much closer.\n    *   Other apples at (1, 9), (2, 9), (8, 7) are further away.\n\n2.  **Strategy:**\n    *   The enemy will almost certainly target the apple at (8, 5) first.\n    *   I should target the apple at (4, 4). Since I am closer than the enemy to this apple, and the enemy is distracted by a closer apple elsewhere, I can safely claim it.\n    *   My path to (4, 4) requires moving 1 step Left (from x=5 to x=4) and 3 steps Up (from y=1 to y=4).\n\n3.  **Move Selection:**\n    *   I can move **UP** to (5, 2) or **LEFT** to (4, 1).\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (4, 1) aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple immediately. This allows for a straight path UP in subsequent turns. It also places me further to the left, increasing the distance from the enemy snake (at x=9), which is safer in the early game to avoid collision surprises.\n    *   Moving **UP** to (5, 2) is also safe but leaves the x-alignment for later and keeps me slightly closer to the enemy.\n    *   **DOWN** moves towards the wall (y=0) and away from the apple. **RIGHT** moves away from the apple.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   I will move LEFT to start my approach to the apple at (4, 4).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nTarget the apple at (4, 4) by moving LEFT then UP x3. This secures the closest apple and positions me on the left side of the board, closer to the subsequent apples at (1, 9) and (2, 9).\n\nLEFT",
