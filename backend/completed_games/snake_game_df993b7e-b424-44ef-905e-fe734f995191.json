So best options are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nStrategy: Move towards the nearest apple to optimize growth and points.\n\nCalculate distances to remaining apples from each candidate square:\n\n- From (1,3):\n\n  - to (0,0): abs(1-0)+abs(3-0) = 1 +3 = 4\n  - to (3,2): abs(1-3)+abs(3-2) = 2 +1 = 3\n  - to (8,3): abs(1-8)+abs(3-3) = 7 +0 =7\n  - to (3,8): abs(1-3)+abs(3-8) = 2 +5 =7\n  - to (9,8): abs(1-9)+abs(3-8) = 8 +5 =13\n\n- From (0,4):\n\n  - to (0,0): abs(0-0)+abs(4-0) = 0 +4 = 4\n  - to (3,2): abs(0-3)+abs(4-2) = 3 +2 = 5\n  - others are further away.\n\n- From (2,4):\n\n  - to (3,2): abs(2-3)+abs(4-2) = 1 +2 = 3\n  - to (0,0): abs(2-0)+abs(4-0) = 2 +4 = 6\n  - others farther\n\nChoosing between DOWN (1,3), LEFT (0,4), and RIGHT (2,4):\n\n- DOWN (1,3) or RIGHT (2,4) are closer to the apple at (3,2), slightly better than LEFT (0,4) in terms of proximity.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (3,2) is only two steps away from both (1,3) and (2,4). \n\nChecking body and walls:\n\n- (1,3) is free.\n- (2,4) is free.\n- (0,4) is free.\n\nNo risk of immediate self-collision by moving down or right.\n\nSince the snake's own body is at (1,5) and (1,6), and head at (1,4), moving down to (1,3) is straightforward and gets closer to the apple at (3,2).\n\nTherefore, decision is to move DOWN.\n\nNext-turn strategy:\n\n- After moving DOWN to (1,3), plan to move RIGHT and then RIGHT again to reach apple at (3,2).\n- Keep monitoring enemy snake's movements.\n\nMove: DOWN"
