I will eliminate any moves that would immediately result in the snake dying by moving it off the board, into its own body, or into the enemy snake's body.\n\n1. **UP**: The snake's head would move to (2, 7). This is a valid move as it does not move off the board, into its own body, or into the enemy snake's body. There is an apple at (2, 7), so the snake would eat it and grow.\n2. **DOWN**: The snake's head would move to (2, 9). This is a valid move as it does not move off the board, into its own body, or into the enemy snake's body.\n3. **LEFT**: The snake's head would move to (1, 8). This is a valid move as it does not move off the board, into its own body, or into the enemy snake's body.\n4. **RIGHT**: The snake's head would move to (3, 8). This is a valid move as it does not move off the board, into its own body, or into the enemy snake's body.\n\nAmong these safe moves, I will favor the one that keeps multiple safe follow-up moves available and moves the snake closer to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions. Moving UP to (2, 7) is advantageous because it allows the snake to eat an apple, potentially increasing its chances of survival and growth.\n\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note**: After eating the apple at (2, 7), continue to expand the snake's body by moving towards other apples, while being cautious of the enemy snake and avoiding head-on collisions.\n\nThe final non-empty line of my response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Without adding any additional information after it:\n\nUP",

This also keeps future maneuverability open, as the new body segment will be at (9,7) which is still adjacent to open space.  \n\nPlan:  \n- Move LEFT to (8,7) to collect the apple.  \n- After growing, keep the head near the center of the board to access many remaining apples.  \n- Continue prioritizing moves that bring us toward apples while avoiding edges and potential head\u2011on clashes with Snake\u202f#1.\n\nLEFT",
