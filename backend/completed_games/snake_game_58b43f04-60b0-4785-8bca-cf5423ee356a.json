My strategy is to move up and right to approach the apple in a more direct manner. Since I'm already at a relatively low y-coordinate, I can prioritize increasing the x-coordinate to get closer to the apple.\n\nHowever, before making a move, I should consider the potential path of snake #0. Although they're at (1, 4) with an empty body, it's essential to keep them in mind to avoid any potential conflicts.\n\nNow, given the board state and my current position, I think my best next move would be to move right. This will not only get me closer to the apple but also allow me to reassess the situation and plan my next move accordingly.\n\nMy decided next move is: RIGHT",

I might get there by moving right first, then up if I can get close enough.\n\nHowever, taking into account my conflicting initial information, let's take a more cautious approach. Moving up, (into my body), from (7, 6) doesn't feel right at this moment. I should think about moving in a different direction to start building up my knowledge about the position.\n\nIf I start by moving right from (7, 6), I can better understand my position and the board around me.

And I'm moving in the up direction, which I previously thought would take me towards the apple at (8, 4). However, if I'm actually at (7, 6), then moving up will take me into the non-existent y-coordinate 7 (or my body, if I don't take care).\n\nHmm, this messes with my strategy a bit. I think I should reassess my next move and strategy overall.\n\nFirst, considering my current position and the apples on the board, let's look at my options:\n\n* The apple at (8, 4) is still a valid target, but I need to reassess my approach to get there.\n* The apple at (9, 8) looks like a good long-term target.\n* I also notice I have an apple at (5, 1) which seems within reach.\n\nOne possible strategy could be to aim for (9, 8) first, since it's a longer-term goal. I might get there by moving right first, then up if I can get close enough.\n\nHowever, taking into account my conflicting initial information, let's take a more cautious approach. Moving up, (into my body), from (7, 6) doesn't feel right at this moment. I should think about moving in a different direction to start building up my knowledge about the position.\n\nIf I start by moving right from (7, 6), I can better understand my position and the board around me. This is safer than trying to move into my own body. Then, once I've reassessed, I can start working towards getting the apple at (8, 4) or any other target that seems feasible.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT",

I might get there by moving right first, then up if I can get close enough.\n\nHowever, taking into account my conflicting initial information, let's take a more cautious approach. Moving up, (into my body), from (7, 6) doesn't feel right at this moment. I should think about moving in a different direction to start building up my knowledge about the position.\n\nIf I start by moving right from (7, 6), I can better understand my position and the board around me. This is safer than trying to move into my own body.
