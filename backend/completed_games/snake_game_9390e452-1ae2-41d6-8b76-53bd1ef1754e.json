No; (9,3) is far down, but moving right could be a good option to get close to the right side.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (7,9) would take us away from immediate threats and closer to the apple at (7,3). But that would increase the distance to the nearest apple at (4,8).\n\n- Given the options, moving RIGHT seems safe and strategic to approach the (9,3) apple, though it\u2019s far now. Alternatively, if we can move LEFT safely, we could approach the closer apple at (4,8) faster.\n\n- Let's check safety:\n\n  - LEFT: (7,9) \u2014 no obstacle; safer if no enemy there.\n\n  - RIGHT: (9,9) \u2014 no obstacle; boundary is at 9, so moving right to (9,9) is valid, and would put us in a position to get the apple at (9,3), although it requires several moves.\n\n- Vertical moves:\n\n  - UP: invalid (would go outside board).\n\n  - DOWN: (8,8), occupied by enemy snake, dangerous.\n\nGiven the above, moving LEFT seems safer and more efficient to reach the nearby apple at (4,8). Moving RIGHT is also safe but less optimal for immediate apple gain.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n- Move LEFT to approach the apple at (4,8). We are at (8,9), so moving LEFT reduces the x-coordinate by 1.\n\n- Next turn: after moving LEFT, we can consider moving toward other apples.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**\n\nNext move: LEFT"

This is the ideal move since it allows me to collect an apple, grow, and score a point.\n- **RIGHT to (6, 8)**: Takes me away from the apple at (4, 8) and doesn't improve my position regarding other apples.\n- **UP to (5, 9)**: Extremely risky as it will result in a collision with the enemy snake.\n- **DOWN to (5, 7)**: Moves away from the closest apple (4, 8) but places me near the apple at (5, 6).
