Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,3) \u2013 empty, inside board, safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,4) \u2013 empty, inside board, safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,4) \u2013 empty, inside board, safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe right now because no snake body exists except heads, and we can\u2019t collide with enemy head unless they move into same cell.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and head-on collision risk:**  \n\nEnemy head at (6,7). Possible moves for enemy: UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7).  \nMy possible moves:  \n- UP (3,5) \u2013 far from enemy\u2019s possible moves, no collision possible.  \n- DOWN (3,3) \u2013 safe.  \n- LEFT (2,4) \u2013 safe.  \n- RIGHT (4,4) \u2013 safe.  \n\nNo possible head-on collision this turn because enemy is too far away (Manhattan distance \u2265 3).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nClosest apple to me: (0,4) is 3 steps left, (5,6) is 2 steps right + 2 up, (5,9) far, (9,2) far, (9,9) far.  \n\n(0,4) is directly left of me at same y=4. Moving LEFT gets me closer to it.  \nAlso, moving LEFT now leaves me at (2,4), which still has 3 directions available next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nMoving RIGHT to (4,4) gets me closer to (5,6) but also closer to enemy at (6,7) eventually.  \n\nGiven early game, I want to collect apples while avoiding enemy. Enemy is at (6,7), so moving toward (0,4) is away from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety:**  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,4), next turn I can go LEFT again to (1,4), then to (0,4) apple. That path seems safe and away from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \n\nCollect (0,4) apple first, then consider moving up toward (5,6) or (9,2) while keeping distance from enemy. Avoid moving toward enemy early when both snakes are short.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT  \n\nLEFT",

To reach it:  \nFrom (6, 7):  \n- LEFT then DOWN \u2192 (5, 7) \u2192 (5, 6) in 2 moves.  \n- DOWN then LEFT \u2192 (6, 6) \u2192 (5, 6) in 2 moves.  \n\nBut we must move one step at a time.  \n\nIf I go LEFT now to (5, 7), next turn I can go DOWN to (5, 6) to eat apple. That\u2019s the fastest route.  \n\nIf I go DOWN now to (6, 6), next turn LEFT to (5, 6) also eats apple.  \n\nBoth are equally short. Which is safer?  \n\nEnemy snake at (3, 4) is far away, so no immediate collision threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Future mobility**  \n\nAfter eating apple at (5, 6), my body will be length 2: head at (5, 6), tail at (5, 7) if I go LEFT then DOWN, or tail at (6, 6) if I go DOWN then LEFT.  \n\nCheck board edges:  \n- If I go LEFT now to (5, 7), next turn DOWN to (5, 6) eats apple, then I\u2019ll be at (5, 6) with tail at (5, 7). Possible next moves: UP (5, 7) blocked by tail, LEFT (4, 6) free, RIGHT (6, 6) free, DOWN (5, 5) free \u2192 3 moves available.  \n- If I go DOWN now to (6, 6), next turn LEFT to (5, 6) eats apple, tail at (6, 6). Then possible moves: UP (5, 7) free, LEFT (4, 6) free, DOWN (5, 5) free, RIGHT blocked by tail? Wait, tail is at (6, 6), head at (5, 6), so RIGHT is (6, 6) which is tail \u2192 not allowed. So only 3 moves too.  \n\nActually, both give same mobility after eating.  \n\nBut going LEFT now to (5, 7) puts me closer to apple (5, 9) afterwards maybe.  \n\nAlso, going DOWN now to (6, 6) leaves me near center, but going LEFT to (5, 7) is slightly closer to other apples along top row later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Avoid potential future dead ends**  \n\nAt length 1, no risk yet. But after eating, need to plan.  \n\nLEFT seems fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan note**  \n\nPlan: Grab closest apple (5, 6) next turn, then head toward (5, 9) or (9, 9) while avoiding enemy. Keep to edges for more space if possible.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Possible enemy moves: UP (5,7) (its own body, so not allowed), DOWN (5,5), LEFT (4,6), RIGHT (6,6).  \nMy possible moves:  \n- UP (1,5) \u2013 no overlap with enemy\u2019s possible moves.  \n- DOWN (1,3) \u2013 safe.  \n- LEFT (0,4) \u2013 safe.  \n- RIGHT (2,4) \u2013 safe.  \n\nNo possible head-on collision this turn (Manhattan distance \u2265 4).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nTwo apples are adjacent: (0,4) left, (2,4) right.  \nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I eat apple and grow to length 2 (head at (0,4), tail at (1,4)).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2,4), I eat apple and grow to length 2 (head at (2,4), tail at (1,4)).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety and enemy position:**  \n\nEnemy is at (5,6) with body at (5,7). It cannot move up into its own body, so likely moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I\u2019m in the far left column, which could limit my next moves (only UP, DOWN, RIGHT from there, but RIGHT goes back to (1,4) which will be my tail next turn, so that\u2019s safe).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2,4), I\u2019m more central, with more options next turn.  \n\nBut (2,4) is closer to enemy\u2019s area. However, enemy is still far enough (Manhattan distance 3 from (2,4) to (5,6)).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Keep options open:**  \n\nFrom (0,4) after eating apple: next turn I can go UP to (0,5), DOWN to (0,3), or RIGHT to (1,4) (my tail, so safe). That\u2019s 3 options.  \nFrom (2,4) after eating apple: next turn I can go UP (2,5), DOWN (2,3), LEFT (1,4) (tail), RIGHT (3,4). That\u2019s 4 options.  \n\nSo RIGHT gives more freedom next turn.  \n\nAlso, if I go LEFT to (0,4), I\u2019m in the corner, which could be risky if enemy approaches later, but not immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \n\nEat one apple now, then move toward other apples while staying away from enemy. After eating, I\u2019ll have a body, so need to avoid moving into my own tail on future turns.  \n\nGiven both apples are equally close, RIGHT gives more central position and more options next turn, so I\u2019ll go RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nEat (2,4) apple now, then likely move UP/DOWN/LEFT next turn to avoid trapping myself. Keep an eye on enemy #0\u2019s movement toward (5,9) or (9,9).  \n\nRIGHT",

Also avoids immediate collision risk.  \nEnemy might go for (4, 1) apple, so I can let them have it and focus on other apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** UP is safe, maintains mobility, avoids head-on risk, and positions for future apples.  \n\nUP",

So body: [(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7)].  \nFrom (5, 9) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 death \u2192 not allowed  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 8) \u2014 my body \u2192 suicide  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 9) \u2014 empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 9) \u2014 empty  \n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT safe next turn \u2014 mobility reduced.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Risk of trapping**  \nEating apple at (5, 9) puts me in top row with only sideways moves next turn. But enemy is far, so not immediately dangerous \u2014 but could be predictable.  \n\nLEFT or RIGHT now avoids trapping myself in corner but delays apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Long-term strategy**  \nEnemy has 2 apples, I have 1. If I eat (5, 9), I tie at 2 apples.  \nApple (4, 9) is also nearby after eating (5, 9) \u2014 could go LEFT next turn to (4, 9) for another apple.  \n\nBut eating apple now is safe and increases score \u2014 priority.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (5, 9), next turn go LEFT to (4, 9) for another apple if possible, or RIGHT to (6, 9) if enemy threatens. Avoid getting stuck along top edge \u2014 plan an escape downward after securing apples.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

UP/DOWN keep mobility but delay apple.  \n\n**Step 6: Risk assessment**  \nEating apple at (0, 4) puts me in a corner with only 2 moves next turn, but enemy is far and I\u2019ll have score lead (4 vs 3).  \nIf I go UP or DOWN, enemy might move toward other apples, but I can still get (0, 4) later.  \n\nGiven the lead and safety, taking the apple now seems good \u2014 but must check if corner is dangerous.  \nAfter eating apple at (0, 4), next turn I can go UP or DOWN, both safe. Enemy unlikely to reach me quickly.  \n\n**Step 7: Decision**  \nLEFT gets apple immediately and extends lead. Short-term mobility reduction is acceptable given distance to enemy.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (0, 4), choose UP or DOWN based on future apple locations and enemy movement. Possibly aim for (1, 2) next.  \n\nLEFT",

Need to catch up.  \n\n---\n\nGiven all this:  \nUP gives most options now and keeps me closer to apples while avoiding immediate danger.  \n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 8), I can choose UP to (8, 9) to approach (9, 9) from left, or go LEFT/DOWN to avoid trap if needed.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

After UP, my body: [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6)] \u2014 tail at (9,5) gone. So (8,8) is body next turn, so DOWN unsafe.  \n   - LEFT (7,9) \u2013 empty.  \n   - RIGHT (9,9) \u2013 apple, safe unless enemy gets there (unlikely).  \n   \u2192 Only LEFT and RIGHT safe next turn.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (7,8):**  \n   Next turn from (7,8):  \n   - UP (7,9) \u2013 empty.  \n   - DOWN (7,7) \u2013 empty.  \n   - LEFT (6,8) \u2013 empty.  \n   - RIGHT (8,8) \u2013 body next turn (since I moved LEFT, body: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6)]), so RIGHT unsafe.  \n   \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (9,8):**  \n   Next turn from (9,8):  \n   - UP (9,9) \u2013 apple, safe.  \n   - DOWN (9,7) \u2013 body next turn (since body: [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6)]), so DOWN unsafe.  \n   - LEFT (8,8) \u2013 body next turn, unsafe.  \n   - RIGHT off board.  \n   \u2192 Only UP safe next turn \u2014 dangerous trap.  \n\nSo RIGHT is risky because it leaves only one safe move next turn (UP into (9,9)), and after eating (9,9), I\u2019d be at (9,9) with only (9,8) as body behind me and maybe only LEFT (8,9) safe \u2014 but (8,9) could be body by then? Let\u2019s check: If I go RIGHT now to (9,8), then next turn UP to (9,9) apple:  \nBody after eating: [(9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6)] \u2014 tail at (9,5) gone.  \nFrom (9,9):  \n- DOWN (9,8) \u2013 body, unsafe.  \n- LEFT (8,9) \u2013 empty.  \n- UP/RIGHT off board.  \nSo only LEFT safe \u2014 that\u2019s a trap.  \n\nThus RIGHT now is too risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare UP vs LEFT:**  \nUP (8,9) gives 2 safe moves next turn but puts me closer to (9,9) apple with option to go RIGHT to apple next turn, but then I\u2019d be at (9,9) with only DOWN (9,8) safe? Wait, check:  \nIf I go UP now to (8,9), next turn RIGHT to (9,9) apple:  \nBody after eating: [(9,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6)]  \nFrom (9,9):  \n- DOWN (9,8) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (8,9) \u2013 body, unsafe.  \n- UP/RIGHT off board.  \nSo only DOWN safe \u2014 still a trap.  \n\nSo eating (9,9) from any direction now seems to trap me unless my tail moves further. My tail is at (9,5) now, will be at (9,4) next turn if no apple eaten. After 2 more moves without eating, (9,8) might be free, making (9,9) safer to eat.  \n\nLEFT (7,8) keeps me flexible with 3 safe moves next turn and avoids premature apple trap.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAvoid (9,9) until tail clears top-right area. Go for (6,9) or (1,7) later. Keep space, don\u2019t box in. Enemy has 6 apples, I have 4 \u2014 but survival first.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT gives most future options and avoids dangerous corner.  \n\nLEFT",

So (7,8) is body next turn, so DOWN unsafe.  \n   - LEFT (6,9) \u2013 apple, safe unless enemy moves there (unlikely).  \n   - RIGHT (8,9) \u2013 empty.  \n   \u2192 Safe next moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\n2. **DOWN to (7,7):**  \n   Next turn from (7,7):  \n   - UP (7,8) \u2013 body next turn, unsafe.  \n   - DOWN (7,6) \u2013 empty.  \n   - LEFT (6,7) \u2013 empty.  \n   - RIGHT (8,7) \u2013 body next turn (since body: [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7)] \u2014 (8,7) is body), unsafe.  \n   \u2192 Safe next moves: DOWN, LEFT (2 options).  \n\n3. **LEFT to (6,8):**  \n   Next turn from (6,8):  \n   - UP (6,9) \u2013 apple, safe.  \n   - DOWN (6,7) \u2013 empty.  \n   - LEFT (5,8) \u2013 empty.  \n   - RIGHT (7,8) \u2013 body next turn, unsafe.  \n   \u2192 Safe next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nLEFT gives the most future flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nLEFT positions me to potentially grab (6,9) next turn while keeping many options open. Avoid (9,9) until tail clears top-right area. Enemy is longer (8 vs my 5), so avoid confrontation.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Wait, from (6, 9) after eating: body behind at (5, 9), so DOWN (6, 8) is body, UP off, LEFT (5, 9) body, RIGHT (7, 9) empty \u2014 actually only RIGHT safe, so that\u2019s a trap.  \n\nBetter to approach apple from side: go LEFT now to (4, 8), then next turn UP to (4, 9), then RIGHT to (5, 9) or (6, 9) depending on apple still there. This keeps more options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nGo LEFT now to keep flexibility. Next turn from (4, 8), consider moving toward (6, 9) via (4, 9) \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 (6, 9) if apple still there. Avoid top-row trap. Enemy is far, no immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Avoid being forced into corners. Enemy is at (2,5), so if I go DOWN too much I might get closer to enemy\u2019s possible path. But currently enemy is 3 rows below and 0 columns away if I go LEFT now? Actually enemy at (2,5), I\u2019d be at (2,8) after LEFT, so same column but 3 apart vertically.

If I go DOWN to (2, 7), enemy could move UP twice to (1, 7) in two turns, but I could get there next turn from (2, 7) by going LEFT.  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 8), enemy could move UP to (1, 6), then UP to (1, 7) next turn \u2014 same timing as me: I\u2019d go DOWN from (1, 8) to (1, 7) next turn, potential head-on collision if enemy also goes to (1, 7) next turn.  \n\nCheck: enemy\u2019s possible moves from (1, 5): UP (1, 6), DOWN (1, 4), LEFT (0, 5).  \nIf enemy goes UP to (1, 6) this turn, then next turn from (1, 6) could go UP to (1, 7).  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 8) this turn, next turn I go DOWN to (1, 7) \u2014 that\u2019s exactly the head-on risk.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 7) this turn, next turn from (2, 7) I go LEFT to (1, 7). Enemy from (1, 6) could also go LEFT to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (2, 6) or UP to (1, 7) \u2014 again possible head-on.  \n\nBut enemy might not go UP this turn \u2014 they might go LEFT or DOWN. Safer to avoid racing to (1, 7) if enemy is close vertically.  \n\nActually, enemy is 3 below me in y, 1 left in x from my head (2, 8) vs (1, 5). If I go LEFT to (1, 8), I\u2019m directly above enemy by 3 cells in y, same x. That\u2019s not immediately dangerous.  \n\nBut going DOWN to (2, 7) puts me 2 above enemy \u2014 closer vertically.  \n\nGiven enemy length advantage, I should avoid moving into their possible upward path.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019ll go LEFT to (1, 8) \u2014 this keeps 3 safe moves next turn, moves toward (1, 7) but also toward left side apples later. Next turn I can decide whether to go DOWN for apple or UP/LEFT to avoid collision if enemy moves toward (1, 7).  \n\nLEFT  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 8), assess enemy\u2019s new head position.

Not worth it unless I\u2019m sure enemy won\u2019t go UP.  \nI can\u2019t be sure \u2014 enemy might want the apple at (1, 7) too. Safer to avoid DOWN this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Compare UP vs LEFT:**  \n\n**UP to (1, 9):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn body: [(1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8)] \u2014 tail (5, 8) gone.  \n- From (1, 9): UP off board, DOWN body, LEFT (0, 9) empty, RIGHT (2, 9) empty \u2192 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (0, 8):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn body: [(0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8)].  \n- From (0, 8): UP (0, 9) empty, DOWN (0, 7) empty, LEFT off board, RIGHT body \u2192 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nBoth give 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future apple access:**  \nFrom (1, 9) next turn: can go LEFT to (0, 9) or RIGHT to (2, 9).

Apple at (1, 7) might still be reachable later if enemy doesn\u2019t take it.  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better because:  \n- It moves away from enemy\u2019s current position (1, 6).  \n- It keeps me near left side where fewer apples but also less enemy presence.  \n- Enemy is longer, so avoiding confrontation is wise.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019ll go LEFT to (0, 8) to stay safe and reassess next turn. Next turn, check if apple (1, 7) is still there and if enemy is near it. If enemy ate it, plan to go toward other apples (maybe bottom ones later).  \n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s risky.  \nIf I go UP and enemy goes elsewhere, I eat apple safely.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and risk**  \nClosest apple: (1, 7) is 1 step away.  \nBut enemy is 2 steps away from (1, 7) as well.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN, they reach (1, 7) same time as me if I go UP \u2192 collision.  \nRisk: Enemy might avoid collision if they think I\u2019m going UP, but I can\u2019t be sure.  \nLEFT or RIGHT avoid immediate collision risk with enemy.\n\n**Step 5: Future mobility**  \nUP (1, 7): after eating apple, body grows to include old tail, so next turn: UP (1, 8) enemy head? dangerous, DOWN (1, 6) body, LEFT (0, 7) empty, RIGHT (2, 7) empty \u2192 2 safe moves, but enemy at (1, 8) could move into (1, 7) next turn if I stay? Actually after eating apple, enemy would be at (1, 8) or elsewhere; if enemy stays at (1, 8), I can\u2019t go UP next turn anyway. Still risky.  \nLEFT (0, 6): UP (0, 7) empty, DOWN (0, 5) empty, LEFT off board, RIGHT (1, 6) body \u2192 2 safe moves.  \nRIGHT (2, 6): UP (2, 7) empty, DOWN (2, 5) body, LEFT (1, 6) body, RIGHT (3, 6) empty \u2192 2 safe moves.  \nAll options have reduced mobility due to body nearby.\n\n**Step 6: Risk assessment**  \nGoing UP risks head-on collision if enemy goes DOWN. Enemy might not take that risk if they see my head close. But they might.  \nLEFT and RIGHT avoid collision this turn but move away from apple.  \nBut apple (1, 7) is high risk now.  \nOther apples: (6, 9) and (9, 9) far, enemy closer to them. (7, 0) and (9, 0) far but safer area.  \nLong-term: I have 7 apples, enemy has 4. If I avoid dying, I\u2019m ahead. Don\u2019t take 50/50 risk.\n\n**Step 7: Decision**  \nBetter to avoid UP this turn because of potential head-on collision. Choose LEFT or RIGHT.  \nRIGHT (2, 6) gives slightly better central position than LEFT (0, 6) which is near wall.  \nRIGHT also allows future movement toward bottom apples or right-side apples.  \nLEFT traps me along left edge.  \nRIGHT is better for future options.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (2, 6), consider going to (3, 6), then down toward (7, 0) or (9, 0) apples, avoiding enemy near top. Let enemy take (1, 7) if they want; I play safe with lead.\n\nRIGHT",

No direct collision risk this turn.  \nEnemy is far enough that immediate head-on collision is unlikely unless we both move many steps toward each other.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (1, 7) is 2 steps away (UP then LEFT from my head), but enemy is closer to it? Enemy at (0, 8) \u2192 (1, 7) is DOWN+RIGHT for them, but they can't go RIGHT into body, so they'd have to go DOWN to (0, 7) then RIGHT to (1, 7) in 2 moves \u2014 same as me if I go UP then LEFT.  \nBut enemy's only safe moves are UP and DOWN, so they can't get to (1, 7) next turn anyway.

RIGHT reduces options.  \nSince enemy is not an immediate threat, go for growth and board control.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter UP to (2, 7), consider LEFT to (1, 7) apple if still there, or continue upward toward (6, 9) if safe.

Since enemy can choose LEFT, RIGHT is dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after each move:**  \n\n**RIGHT to (1, 7):**  \nEat apple \u2192 grow to length 6, body becomes [(1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8)].  \nFrom (1, 7) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 8): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (1, 6): enemy body (snake #0\u2019s segment) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (0, 7): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (2, 7): enemy head location now, but enemy will move this turn. If enemy moves LEFT to (1, 7) we collide this turn, so this scenario doesn\u2019t happen. If enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 7), then (2, 7) is empty next turn, so RIGHT from (1, 7) would be safe. But we must check:  \nActually, if enemy moves RIGHT this turn to (3, 7), then (2, 7) is empty next turn. So from (1, 7) next turn, only RIGHT is safe. That\u2019s 1 safe move \u2192 risky.  \n\n**DOWN to (0, 6):**  \nNo apple. Body: [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8)] (still length 5).  \nFrom (0, 6) next turn:  \n- UP (0, 7): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (0, 5): empty.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (1, 6): enemy body (snake #0\u2019s segment) \u2192 invalid.  \nSo only DOWN (0, 5) is safe next turn \u2192 also risky.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare risks:**  \nRIGHT: possible head-on death this turn.  \nDOWN: safe this turn, but next turn only 1 safe move (DOWN to (0, 5)), which could lead to further constraints.  \n\nBut maybe enemy won\u2019t choose LEFT if it sees risk? But I can\u2019t assume that \u2014 enemy might go LEFT to get apple (1, 7) too. So RIGHT is too risky.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves again:**  \nEnemy at (2, 7) sees:  \nLEFT (1, 7) has apple and is empty now.  \nRIGHT (3, 7) empty.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT, it eats apple and grows to length 9.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT, it stays length 8 but avoids possible head-on if I go RIGHT.  \nBut enemy doesn\u2019t know my move. From enemy\u2019s view, (1, 7) is risky only if I go RIGHT. But enemy might risk it for apple since it\u2019s longer and could survive head-on? No \u2014 head-on kills both regardless of length. So enemy might avoid LEFT if it fears I go RIGHT. But I can\u2019t rely on that.\n\n---\n\nGiven the danger, DOWN seems safer this turn despite limiting next turn\u2019s options. At least I survive this turn. Next turn from (0, 6) only DOWN to (0, 5) is safe, but then from (0, 5) maybe more options open up (RIGHT to (1, 5) is enemy body now but enemy will move).  \n\nActually, from (0, 5) next-next turn:  \nEnemy body will shift, so (1, 5) might become empty if enemy moves away. So not necessarily trapped.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 6), only safe move is DOWN to (0, 5). Take it, then reassess. Avoid enemy head area near top right apples until I can safely grow.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN",

Their possible moves: UP (0, 8) their body \u2192 suicide \u2192 not allowed, DOWN (0, 6) empty, LEFT off board \u2192 suicide \u2192 not allowed, RIGHT (1, 7) apple (but I might go there too).  \nSo enemy can only go DOWN or RIGHT.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 7) same time I go LEFT to (1, 7), head-on collision \u2192 both die. That\u2019s risky.  \n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity**  \n(1, 7) is adjacent to my head, but enemy is also adjacent to it. High risk of head-on collision if we both go for it.  \nOther apples: (6, 9) and (9, 9) far, (7, 0) and (9, 0) far.  \n\n**Step 5: Future mobility**  \nLEFT (1, 7): If I eat apple, my tail grows so my body stays longer. But if enemy goes RIGHT, we collide.  \nRIGHT (3, 7): From there, next turn options: UP (3, 8) enemy body? No, enemy body at (3, 8) is there \u2192 so UP from (3, 7) would hit enemy body \u2192 not safe next turn? Wait, check: enemy body at (3, 8) is not adjacent to (3, 7) except UP? Yes, UP from (3, 7) goes to (3, 8) which is enemy body segment \u2192 so next turn UP would be deadly. But that\u2019s next turn\u2019s problem; this turn it\u2019s safe. Still, reduces future options.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check:  \nFrom (3, 7): UP (3, 8) enemy body \u2192 deadly next turn.  \nDOWN (3, 6) empty.  \nLEFT (2, 7) my body (since I moved from there).  \nRIGHT (4, 7) empty.  \nSo next turn from (3, 7), safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 2 options.  \n\nFrom (1, 7) after eating apple:  \nMy body will be: head (1, 7), then old head (2, 7) becomes body segment, then (2, 6), etc.  \nNext turn from (1, 7): UP (1, 8) enemy body \u2192 no.  \nDOWN (1, 6) my body \u2192 no.  \nLEFT (0, 7) enemy head currently there but enemy will move\u2026 Wait, enemy at (0, 7) now, if they move DOWN to (0, 6), then LEFT from (1, 7) goes to (0, 7) which is empty. But if enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 7), we collide this turn, so not considering that. Actually, if we both go to (1, 7) this turn, game ends. So if I survive, enemy must have gone DOWN. Then next turn from (1, 7): LEFT (0, 7) empty, DOWN (1, 6) my body no, RIGHT (2, 7) my body no, UP (1, 8) enemy body no. So only LEFT is safe next turn. That\u2019s 1 option \u2014 risky.  \n\n**Step 6: Risk assessment**  \nLEFT to (1, 7) risks head-on collision with enemy if they go RIGHT. Enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN (0, 6) and RIGHT (1, 7). So 50% chance they go RIGHT? Not predictable, but dangerous.  \nRIGHT to (3, 7) avoids immediate collision, gives 2 options next turn.  \n\n**Step 7: Long-term plan**  \nEnemy is trapped along left edge for now (can only move vertically on x=0). Let them be stuck; I should avoid risky head-on collisions since I\u2019m ahead in apples (7 vs 4). Go for safer moves to survive.  \n\nRIGHT is safer this turn.  \n\n**Step 8: Decision**  \nChoose RIGHT to avoid potential head-on collision and keep game going with my lead.  \n\nRIGHT",

So can\u2019t get it directly.\n\n**Step 5: Future mobility**  \nFrom (3, 7):  \n- UP (3, 8): next turn options: UP (3, 9) empty, DOWN (3, 7) my old head? Wait, my body will be: head (3, 8), then (3, 7), (2, 7), etc. So next turn from (3, 8): UP (3, 9) empty, DOWN (3, 7) body \u2192 no, LEFT (2, 8) enemy body \u2192 no, RIGHT (4, 8) empty. So 2 safe moves next turn.  \n- DOWN (3, 6): next turn: UP (3, 7) body \u2192 no, DOWN (3, 5) body \u2192 no, LEFT (2, 6) body \u2192 no, RIGHT (4, 6) empty. Only RIGHT safe \u2192 1 option.  \n- RIGHT (4, 7): next turn: UP (4, 8) empty, DOWN (4, 6) empty, LEFT (3, 7) body \u2192 no, RIGHT (5, 7) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo RIGHT gives best future mobility.\n\n**Step 6: Long-term plan**  \nEnemy is trapped along left edge; they can only move vertically on x=0 for now. I\u2019m ahead 7 vs 4 apples. Focus on survival and keeping options open. RIGHT opens more space toward center/right side apples later.\n\n**Step 7: Decision**  \nRIGHT maximizes future mobility and is safe with no enemy collision risk.\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN leads to body after eating apple? Wait: If I eat apple at (6, 9), tail doesn\u2019t move, so former head position (6, 8) becomes body? Actually: move happens first: head goes to (6, 9), apple eaten \u2192 body grows: new body segment added at old head position? Common Snake growth: tail stays put, so body segments shift; old head cell becomes neck. So (6, 8) is now body, DOWN not possible next turn? Actually: on movement + growth: The snake moves forward one cell (new head), a new body segment is added at the old head position. So yes, in the next turn from (6, 9), DOWN to (6, 8) is body segment \u2192 suicide \u2192 forbidden. So from (6, 9) next turn: UP off board \u2192 invalid; DOWN to body \u2192 invalid; only LEFT and RIGHT valid \u2192 2 moves \u2192 risky.  \n- DOWN (6, 7): Next turn options: UP (6, 8) body segment \u2192 no, DOWN (6, 6) empty, LEFT (5, 7) body \u2192 no, RIGHT (7, 7) empty \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n- RIGHT (7, 8): Next turn options: UP (7, 9) empty, DOWN (7, 7) empty, LEFT (6, 8) body possibly? Wait: if I move to (7, 8) without eating apple, body shifts: tail (1,6) gone, new body: head (7,8), then (6,8) old head, down to (5,8)... so (6,8) is body, so LEFT from (7, 8) next turn leads to (6,8) body \u2192 invalid.

UP and RIGHT both lead to (9,9) apple but reduce mobility next turn to 2 moves.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nApple at (9,9) can be reached in 2 turns via either UP or RIGHT.  \nIf I go UP (8,9), next turn I can go RIGHT (9,9) to eat apple.  \nIf I go RIGHT (9,8), next turn I can go UP (9,9) to eat apple.  \nBoth are equivalent in steps to apple.  \n\nBut going RIGHT (9,8) puts me at the right edge, which is slightly riskier than UP (8,9) because from (9,8) I have only UP and DOWN next turn, both along the edge. From (8,9) I have LEFT and RIGHT next turn along the top edge.  \n\nActually, both are similar risk level after 1 move.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nAfter eating (9,9), I\u2019ll grow to length 9 and can plan for (6,9) apple next. Enemy is far away and shorter.  \nGiven my lead (7 apples vs 4), playing safe and securing apples is good.  \n\nRIGHT seems slightly better because it positions me to eat (9,9) next turn while also being closer to the right-edge apples later.  \n\nBut UP also works. Let\u2019s check:  \nIf I go UP now, next turn I must go RIGHT to get apple, leaving me at (9,9) with body behind me at (8,9),(7,8),...  \nIf I go RIGHT now, next turn I must go UP to get apple, leaving me at (9,9) with body behind me at (9,8),(7,8),...  \n\nActually, both sequences end with same position (9,9) and similar body configuration.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT now because it\u2019s symmetric and keeps options open for lower apples later.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn**: From (9,8), go UP to (9,9) to eat apple if safe. Then consider path to (6,9) or (7,0) depending on enemy movement.\n\nRIGHT",

Eating it secures my lead (8 apples vs enemy 4).  \nUP: immediate apple.  \nDOWN: moves away from apples, maybe toward (7,0) later but longer route.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each move**  \nIf UP (9,9):  \nGrow by 1, new length 9, body extends at (9,9) plus old body.  \nNext turn from (9,9): Only move options: DOWN (9,8) would be my new body segment next turn (the old head at (9,8) becomes body)? Wait \u2014 need to simulate:  \nCurrent body: head: (9,8) body: [(8,8), (7,8), ...]  \nMove UP to (9,9) apple: snake grows, so the tail doesn\u2019t move. New head (9,9), body becomes [(9,8), (8,8), (7,8), ... (3,7)] \u2192 length 9.  \nSo at next turn from (9,9): possible moves:  \n- DOWN (9,8): segment of my body (the one right behind head) -> unsafe  \n- LEFT (8,9): empty  \n- RIGHT: off board invalid  \n- UP: off board invalid  \nSo only option next turn after eating apple at (9,9) is LEFT to (8,9). That\u2019s actually risky \u2014 gets me to one safe move only, possible trap.  \n\nIf DOWN (9,7):  \nBody becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), ... (4,7)] after moving without eating apple.  \nNext turn from (9,7): UP blocked by body (9,8), DOWN (9,6) free, LEFT (8,7) free, RIGHT off board \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nSo UP leaves 1 safe move next turn; DOWN leaves 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nUP gives apple but leads to a potential dead end at top-right next turn (only escape is LEFT). Could be dangerous if enemy approaches.  \nDOWN avoids immediate apple but keeps mobility better.  \nHowever, enemy is really far (8 distance) so not an immediate threat.  \n\nBut if I don\u2019t eat apple UP now, enemy could move toward it? No, enemy is too far to reach (9,9) in next 2 turns anyway.  \n\nStill, taking apple now increases my lead and I can manage the trap by planning to go LEFT next turn.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nGoing UP to eat apple (9,9) is safe now and ensures no other snake takes it soon. I\u2019ll have to deal with the limited mobility next turn but that\u2019s okay with such an enemy distance.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,9) after eating apple, only safe move will be LEFT to (8,9). Then I can think about pathing to (6,9) or eventually other apples.\n\n**Final choice:**  \n\nUP",

Need to move along top row until tail advances (tail will move when I move, but since I just ate an apple last turn, my tail stays at (5, 7) until I move enough cells to pull it forward). Actually: let\u2019s check:  \nApples collected: 9 \u2192 length 10 segments.  \nInitial body length was 9 plus 1 apple eaten last move. Yes, tail stays fixed this turn. After this move (turn 47), tail will remain (5, 7) until we move 3 more steps maybe? Wait \u2014 better to track: Snake length 10 means body segments = 9 + head. On turn 45: head at (7,9), body 8 segments, total 9. On turn 46: head at (6,9), add apple: new length 10, so new segment added at old tail position \u2014 but actually in mechanics: the new segment is added at the tail after the move? Actually in classic Snake: when you eat apple, you grow by 1 at the end (tail doesn\u2019t move that turn), but on subsequent moves, tail moves normally unless you eat again.  \n\nSo after turn 46: head (6,9), tail (5,7), length 10. Now if I move to (5,9) on turn 47 without eating apple, tail moves to next segment (???) or stays? Let\u2019s clarify: Traditional Snake:  \nTurn sequence:  \n- Move head to (5,9), body follows: new head (5,9), previous head (6,9) becomes neck, and so on, last segment (tail) is removed, unless apple eaten. Since no apple eaten this turn, tail advances:  \nOld tail was (5,7), previous segment before tail is (6,8), so snake moves: head: (5,9), then segments: (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8) length=10. So tail becomes (5,8). That\u2019s correct because length doesn\u2019t change.  \n\nThen from (5,9) next turn: DOWN to (5,8) is body? Yes, (5,8) becomes tail after this move, so next turn (5,8) will be empty (tail moved out) if I move head away? Wait, no: I have to check:  \nAfter turn 47: body: (6,9), (7,9), ..., down to tail (5,8).  \nSo turn 48 head at (5,9):  \n- DOWN (5,8) is tail of snake -> body collision? Yes, touching any body segment kills. So still unsafe.  \n\nSo need to continue LEFT along top row for a while until tail catches up and moves far enough.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nKeep moving left along top row: (5,9) -> (4,9) -> (3,9) ... until we can go down at (2,9) or (1,9) to approach apple at (1,7). This is safe path. Avoid being stuck if enemy approaches, but enemy is far.  \n\n**Move:**\nLEFT",
