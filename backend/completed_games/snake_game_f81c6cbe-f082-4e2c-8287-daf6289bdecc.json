So LEFT now \u2192 next turn can eat apple at (0, 1) if still there.  \n  Risk: moving into column 0 reduces lateral freedom, but not trapped yet.\n\n- **DOWN (1, 1)**:  \n  Next turn from (1, 1): can go UP (1, 2) (body? Wait, body will be at (1, 2) after moving? Let\u2019s simulate: if I move DOWN to (1, 1), my body becomes [(1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)] \u2014 tail at (2, 0) will move next turn if no apple eaten. Actually, I haven\u2019t eaten apple now, so tail moves forward: new body after move: head (1, 1), then (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1). So (1, 2) is my neck, so UP next turn is blocked.  \n  From (1, 1) next turn: UP (1, 2) blocked, DOWN (1, 0) empty, LEFT (0, 1) apple, RIGHT (2, 1) empty. So 3 safe moves.  \n  DOWN now also gets me closer to (0, 0) and (0, 1).\n\n- **UP (1, 3)**:  \n  Next turn from (1, 3): can go UP (1, 4) toward (0, 4) apple, DOWN (1, 2) empty (neck), LEFT (0, 3) empty, RIGHT (2, 3) empty.  \n  Moves away from (0, 1) but toward (0, 4) and (0, 7).\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid dead ends and keep options:**  \nColumn 0 is not a dead end yet because I can go up/down within it after entering.  \nBut (0, 1) apple is tempting \u2014 if I go LEFT now to (0, 2), I guarantee I can eat (0, 1) next turn unless enemy somehow gets there (impossible in 1 turn from (9, 8)).  \n\nIf I go DOWN now to (1, 1), I can eat (0, 1) next turn too (by going LEFT).  \nDifference:  \n- LEFT now \u2192 (0, 2) \u2192 next turn DOWN to (0, 1) apple.  \n- DOWN now \u2192 (1, 1) \u2192 next turn LEFT to (0, 1) apple.  \n\nBoth get apple in 2 moves. But DOWN now keeps me in column 1, which gives more space (can go RIGHT next turn if needed). LEFT now commits to column 0, which might be slightly riskier if I need to avoid being trapped later.  \n\nGiven enemy is far away, I prefer DOWN now for slightly more flexibility, then eat (0, 1) next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Check for possible head-on collision:**  \nEnemy at (9, 8) cannot reach my target cells (1, 1) or (0, 2) in 1 move. No risk.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nMove DOWN to (1, 1) \u2192 next turn eat (0, 1) apple \u2192 then either go to (0, 0) apple or up toward (0, 4). Keep enemy in mind \u2014 it\u2019s longer but far away. Avoid boxing self in bottom-left after eating those apples; maybe after (0, 1) and (0, 0), move up column 0 toward (0, 4) and (0, 7).\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

So only UP or DOWN safe. That\u2019s a bit limiting but not trapped yet.  \n\nIf I go DOWN now to (1, 0):  \nNext turn from (1, 0): possible moves: UP (1, 1) my body, DOWN (1, -1) off board, LEFT (0, 0) apple, RIGHT (2, 0) empty. So only LEFT or RIGHT safe. That\u2019s also limiting.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Compare risks:**  \nGoing LEFT now gets apple immediately, grows, and puts me at (0, 1) with 2 safe moves next turn (UP or DOWN).  \nGoing DOWN now delays apple but keeps me at (1, 0) with 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT to apple or RIGHT).  \n\nEnemy is far away, so no immediate collision risk either way.  \n\nBut if I go DOWN now, apple at (0, 1) could be eaten by enemy? No, enemy is at (8, 8), can\u2019t reach (0, 1) in 1 turn.  \n\nStill, eating apple sooner is good for score and growth. Also, after eating at (0, 1), I can go DOWN to (0, 0) next turn for another apple, then go UP along left wall toward (0, 4) and (0, 7).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term path:**  \nIf I eat (0, 1) now \u2192 (0, 0) next turn \u2192 then up column 0 toward other apples. That\u2019s a clear path with minimal risk since enemy is far right.  \n\nIf I go DOWN now to (1, 0), I still can get (0, 1) later, but it\u2019s less direct and I might waste turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Check head-on collision possibility:**  \nEnemy moving DOWN to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 8) \u2014 nowhere near (0, 1) or (1, 0). Safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nEat (0, 1) now \u2192 next turn eat (0, 0) \u2192 then move up column 0 toward (0, 4) and (0, 7). Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s length advantage; we need apples quickly. Avoid boxing self in bottom-left after (0, 0) \u2014 go up immediately.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s risky \u2014 one safe move means I could be trapped if enemy approaches.  \n\n**UP (0, 2)**: no apple, head at (0, 2) next turn.  \nFrom (0, 2) next turn: possible moves:  \n- UP (0, 3): empty, safe.  \n- DOWN (0, 1): my body \u2192 no.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 no.  \n- RIGHT (1, 2): my body (currently at (1, 2), but after moving UP this turn, tail moves forward one, so (1, 2) might become tail or be gone? Let\u2019s check: current body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)]. After moving UP without eating: new head (0, 2), new body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)], tail (2, 2) disappears, new tail (2, 2)? Wait, actually: old body: head (0,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1). Move UP: new head (0,2), add (0,1) as new segment after head, keep old body except last segment removed: so body becomes [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)]. So (1,2) is still in body, (2,2) is tail. So next turn from (0,2): UP (0,3) empty, DOWN (0,1) body, LEFT off, RIGHT (1,2) body. So only UP is safe next turn. That\u2019s also risky \u2014 one safe move.  \n\nHmm \u2014 both UP and DOWN leave me with only one safe move next turn if I don\u2019t eat? Let\u2019s recheck DOWN case more carefully:  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,0) and eat apple:  \nNew length 6, body: [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1)] (tail is (2,1)).  \nNext turn from (0,0):  \nUP (0,1) is body \u2192 no.  \nDOWN off \u2192 no.  \nLEFT off \u2192 no.  \nRIGHT (1,0) empty \u2192 yes. So only RIGHT safe.  \n\nIf I go UP to (0,2) no apple:  \nNew length 5, body: [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)] (tail was (2,1) removed).  \nNext turn from (0,2):  \nUP (0,3) empty \u2192 yes.  \nDOWN (0,1) body \u2192 no.  \nLEFT off \u2192 no.  \nRIGHT (1,2) body \u2192 no. So only UP safe.  \n\nSo both options lead to exactly one safe move next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Which is better?**  \n\nGoing DOWN gets an apple now (score 5), but next turn only RIGHT is safe, to (1,0). From (1,0) after that, options open up possibly.  \n\nGoing UP gets no apple, but next turn only UP safe to (0,3), then from (0,3) maybe more options toward apple at (0,4) or (0,7).  \n\nEnemy is far away, so immediate danger low.  \n\nLong-term plan from last turn was: eat (0,1) \u2192 (0,0) \u2192 up column 0.  \nI already ate (0,1) last turn, so now eating (0,0) fits that plan.  \n\nBut eating (0,0) now leaves me at (0,0) with only RIGHT next turn \u2014 that\u2019s a corner, could be dangerous if enemy ever comes near.  \n\nGoing UP now delays apple but keeps me moving up left column toward other apples (0,4), (0,7).  \n\nGiven enemy length advantage (7 vs my 5 after eating (0,0) would be 6), I need apples but also must avoid dead ends.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Check if DOWN (0,0) is a dead end next turn:**  \nFrom (0,0) only RIGHT to (1,0).  \nFrom (1,0) next turn: possible moves:  \nUP (1,1) body? Let\u2019s simulate: after eating (0,0), body: [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1)].  \nIf I go RIGHT to (1,0) next turn (without eating), new body: [(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)], tail (2,2) removed.  \nFrom (1,0):  \nUP (1,1) body \u2192 no.  \nDOWN (1,-1) off \u2192 no.  \nLEFT (0,0) body \u2192 no.  \nRIGHT (2,0) empty \u2192 yes. So again only one safe move. That\u2019s a pattern of being stuck along bottom wall.  \n\nSo DOWN seems to trap me along bottom with single-move options for a while.  \n\nUP path: from (0,2) \u2192 (0,3) only UP safe \u2192 (0,4) apple there! That\u2019s good \u2014 so UP now \u2192 UP next turn to (0,3) \u2192 then from (0,3) to (0,4) apple, and after eating apple at (0,4), more space above.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP now gives a path to apple at (0,4) in two moves with minimal risk (enemy far).  \nDOWN now gives apple immediately but traps me in bottom-left with limited moves.  \n\nBetter to go UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nUP now to (0,2) \u2192 next turn UP to (0,3) (only safe move) \u2192 then to (0,4) apple. After that, consider going to (0,7) apple or moving right toward center to avoid being stuck on left edge. Enemy is on right side, so left column is relatively safe for now.  \n\nUP",

However, eating now grows my length, which can be useful for blocking enemy later.  \n\nCheck if UP is risky:  \n- Enemy at (5, 8) cannot reach (0, 4) in one move, so no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n- No other snakes.  \nSo both UP and RIGHT are safe this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll choose UP to eat the apple and grow, because:  \n1.

No immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Consequences of each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (0, 6):**  \n- No apple eaten.  \n- Next turn body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1)]  \n- From (0, 6) next turn:  \n  - UP (0, 7): apple present, safe if no enemy arrives there simultaneously.  \n  - DOWN (0, 5): body \u2192 no.  \n  - LEFT off \u2192 no.  \n  - RIGHT (1, 6): empty, safe.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn (UP, RIGHT).  \n\n**RIGHT to (1, 5):**  \n- No apple eaten.  \n- Next turn body: [(1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1)]  \n- From (1, 5) next turn:  \n  - UP (1, 6): empty, safe.  \n  - DOWN (1, 4): empty, safe.  \n  - LEFT (0, 5): body \u2192 no.  \n  - RIGHT (2, 5): empty, safe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple: (0, 7) is 2 moves away via UP UP.  \n(3, 4) is 4 moves away via RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN from (1,5).  \n(4, 3) is farther.  \n\nEnemy may go for (2, 9) or (4, 3) or (3, 4).  \nIf enemy goes DOWN from (4, 9) to (4, 8), it\u2019s heading toward (4, 3) or (3, 4).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Safety and flexibility:**  \nRIGHT gives more options next turn (3 vs 2 safe moves).  \nUP progresses toward apple (0, 7) but risks getting trapped on left edge after eating it. However, enemy is far, so I can eat (0, 7) next turn if I go UP now, then immediately move RIGHT to (1, 7) to avoid being stuck.  \n\nBut I must check simultaneous moves: If I go UP to (0, 6) now, enemy could move toward (0, 7) too? Unlikely, enemy is at (4, 9), (0, 7) is 4 Manhattan away from enemy, but enemy might not go that far left this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll choose UP because:  \n1. It\u2019s safe this turn.  \n2. It puts me one step from apple (0, 7) which I can eat next turn if safe.  \n3. After eating (0, 7), I\u2019ll have length 7 (still shorter than enemy\u2019s 8), but I can then move RIGHT to open space.  \n4. Enemy is far and likely moving toward other apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (0, 6), if apple (0, 7) is still there and enemy not adjacent to it, go UP to eat it, then immediately go RIGHT to (1, 7) to avoid left-edge trap. If enemy is near (0, 7) next turn, avoid and go RIGHT instead. Keep monitoring enemy\u2019s path toward (3, 4) and (4, 3).  \n\nUP",

Neither conflicts with my possible moves this turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nEating (1,5) now gives a point but reduces next-turn options to 2, which could be risky if enemy moves toward (2,5) or (1,4).  \nUP or RIGHT keep more options open.  \nRIGHT moves me toward central apples (3,4) and (4,3) and keeps distance from enemy in top rows.  \nUP moves me toward top-left where apple (0,7) is, but that apple is on edge and may be harder to reach safely later.  \n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better for long-term positioning toward central apples while maintaining flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2,6), assess enemy movement. Aim to approach (3,4) or (4,3) via safe path, avoiding being trapped against my own body. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible descent from top rows.  \n\nRIGHT",

UP is blocked by my body at (3, 9), and LEFT is blocked by my body at (2, 8).\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\n- **Apple proximity:** The closest apples are at (3, 4) and (4, 3), which are southwest of my position\n- **RIGHT** to (4, 8) keeps me in a relatively safe central area with multiple escape routes\n- **DOWN** to (3, 7) brings me closer to the apples at (3, 4) and (4, 3), and also puts some distance between me and the enemy snake\n- **Enemy snake #1** at (3, 6) with body extending leftward poses a moderate threat if I go too far down\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- If I go DOWN to (3, 7), I'll be just above the enemy snake's head at (3, 6)\n- The enemy snake could move UP, RIGHT, DOWN, or LEFT from (3, 6)\n- If the enemy moves UP while I move DOWN, we could have a head-on collision at (3, 7) if it's allowed to move there\n- Going RIGHT to (4, 8) is safer from the enemy snake\n\n**Best move:**\nDOWN is the better strategic choice. It brings me closer to the apples at (3, 4) and (4, 3), maintains good future mobility, and the risk of collision with the enemy snake is manageable since we're not directly aligned vertically.\n\n**Future plan:**\nHead toward the apple cluster at (3, 4) and (4, 3) while keeping the enemy snake in view. Maintain central positioning and avoid getting trapped in corners. Consider moving leftward through row 7 to collect apple at (0, 7) after securing the closer apples.\n\nDOWN",

It maintains safe distance from the enemy snake, keeps me in a good central position with multiple future options, and moves me toward the eastern side of the board where I can access apples at (7, 1) while also potentially circling back to (4, 3).\n\n**Future plan:**\nContinue moving eastward toward the apple at (7, 1). From the right side, I can look for opportunities to safely collect (4, 3) while avoiding direct confrontation with snake #1 which is currently positioned between me and that apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Watch enemy\u2019s new head position after this turn. If enemy moves toward (5,5), they may try to cut me off from top apples \u2014 but I can go for bottom apple (7,1) safely.  \n\nRIGHT",
