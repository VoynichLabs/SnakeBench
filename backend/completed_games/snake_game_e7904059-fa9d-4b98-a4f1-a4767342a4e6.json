This is within the board and does not immediately collide with any snake's body (including your own, since you have no body yet).\n- Moving **DOWN** from (3,0) would take your head to (3,-1), which is off the board. **Eliminate DOWN**.\n- Moving **LEFT** from (3,0) would take your head to (2,0). This is within the board and does not immediately collide with any snake's body.\n- Moving **RIGHT** from (3,0) would take your head to (4,0). This is within the board and does not immediately collide with any snake's body.\n\nAll four directions are safe for the first move, but we need to consider long-term strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Notes:\n1. **Avoid Immediate Collision with Snake #1:**\n   - Snake #1 is at (0,0). If it moves **RIGHT**, it will reach (1,0) on Turn 1. If it moves **UP**, it will reach (0,1).\n   - If I move **LEFT** to (2,0), I will be adjacent to Snake #1's potential position (1,0) on Turn 1. This could lead to a head-on collision if Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** and I move **LEFT** again, or if Snake #1 moves **UP** to (0,1) and I move **UP** to (2,1) on Turn 1.\n   - If I move **RIGHT** to (4,0), I will be further away from Snake #1's potential positions, reducing the risk of immediate head-on collision.\n\n2. **Apple Accessibility:**\n   - The closest apple to my current position (3,0) is at (4,6) and (4,9), which are 4 units away vertically (UP).\n   - Moving **UP** would take me directly toward the apples at (4,6) and (4,9), but I need to ensure I don't get trapped or boxed in by Snake #1.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** would take me to (4,0), which is closer to the apples at (4,6) and (4,9) in terms of future flexibility (I can then move UP or LEFT to reach them).\n\n3. **Future Flexibility:**\n   - Moving **UP** to (3,1) gives me more options to move **LEFT**, **RIGHT**, or **UP** again in the next turn.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to (4,0) also gives me flexibility, but it might be safer given Snake #1's position.\n   - Moving **LEFT** to (2,0) is risky due to proximity to Snake #1's potential position.\n   - Moving **UP** to (3,1) is the most balanced move, as it keeps distance from Snake #1 while moving toward apples.\n\n---\n\n### Decision for Turn 0:\n- **UP** is the safest move that keeps me alive and moves me toward apples without immediately risking collision with Snake #1.\n- It also maintains flexibility for future moves, as I can then explore both **LEFT** and **RIGHT** directions from (3,1).\n\nUP",

If Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to **(1, 6)**, it would not collide with me, but I would be closer to the apple at **(4, 6)**.\n\n---\n\n### Apple Accessibility:\n- The apple at **(4, 6)** is **directly reachable** by moving **UP** to **(4, 6)** this turn.\n- The apple at **(4, 9)** is reachable by moving **UP** repeatedly to reach higher y-values.\n- The apple at **(9, 1)** is far away but could be a target if Snake #1 moves toward it.\n- The apple at **(2, 9)** and **(8, 8)** are also reachable but require longer paths.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\n1. **Prioritize Apple Collection:**\n   - Moving **UP** to **(4, 6)** allows me to collect the apple immediately, growing my snake to 1 segment and gaining 1 point.\n   - This is an optimal move since it directly increases my score and body length.\n\n2. **Avoid Snake #1:**\n   - Snake #1 is at **(0, 6)** and moving **UP** to **(4, 6)** does not immediately threaten it (unless it moves **UP** to **(0, 7)** and then **RIGHT** repeatedly, but that would take multiple turns).\n   - Collecting the apple at **(4, 6)** is safe and does not trap me.\n\n3. **Future Flexibility:**\n   - After collecting the apple at **(4, 6)**, my snake will have a body segment at **(4, 5)** (original head position).\n   - This means I need to avoid moving **DOWN** to **(4, 4)** on the next turn (since that would be moving into my own body).\n   - However, this is not a problem for the next turn since I can move **UP**, **LEFT**, or **RIGHT** safely.\n\n---\n\n### Decision for Turn 6:\n- **UP** to **(4, 6)** is the best move to collect the apple immediately, increasing my score and body length while maintaining flexibility and avoiding Snake #1.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note to Future Self:\n- After moving **UP** to **(4, 6)**, my snake will have a body segment at **(4, 5)**.\n- On the next turn, avoid moving **DOWN** to **(4, 4)** (would hit my own body).\n- Prioritize moving toward the apple at **(4, 9)** by moving **UP** repeatedly.\n- If Snake #1 moves **UP** to **(0, 7)**, it is not an immediate threat, but keep an eye on its potential path.\n- If Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to **(1, 6)**, it will not collide with me, but I should continue moving **UP** to **(4, 7)** on the next turn to avoid getting boxed in.\n\nUP",
