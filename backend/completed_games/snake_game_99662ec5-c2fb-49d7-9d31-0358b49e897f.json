Yes, within bounds, no collisions\n   - Benefit? Gets me closer to apple at (1, 6), maintains central position\n   - Opens up: Can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN next turn\n\n2. **DOWN** - Move to (3, 4)\n   - Safe? Yes, within bounds, no collisions\n   - Benefit? Gets me closer to apple at (4, 3), maintains central position\n   - Opens up: Can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN next turn\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (2, 5)\n   - Safe? Yes, within bounds, no collisions\n   - Benefit? Gets me closer to apples at (1, 5) and (1, 6)\n   - Opens up: Can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN next turn\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Move to (4, 5)\n   - Safe? Yes, within bounds, no collisions\n   - Benefit? Gets me closer to apple at (4, 3) and (9, 6)\n   - Opens up: Can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN next turn\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nLooking at the apple distribution:\n- Closest apples: (1, 5) and (1, 6) are 2 steps left from my current position\n- (4, 3) is 1 step right and 2 steps down\n- The enemy is far away at (0, 9), so early apple collection is safe\n\nThe most efficient path would be to go LEFT toward the cluster of apples at (1, 5) and (1, 6). These two apples are adjacent and would give me quick growth.\n\n**Long-term strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 0: Move LEFT to (2, 5) - heading toward apple cluster at (1, 5)/(1, 6)\n- Turn 1: Continue LEFT to (1, 5) - collect first apple\n- Turn 2: Move UP to (1, 6) - collect second apple and grow to 3 segments\n- After collecting these, pivot toward (4, 3) or explore the map while staying away from enemy\n\nLEFT is the optimal move to position myself toward the nearest high-value apple cluster.\n\nLEFT",
