Let's make some serious noise!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\nI'm Snake 0, starting at (9, 6), basically chilling in the top-right corner.\nArchrival Snake 1 is at (5, 4), dead center.\nBoard is 10x10. No bodies yet, so we're looking at pure head movement strategy.\n\n**Goal:** Box him in, assert dominance, and get those first apples! We need to make a statement!\n\n**Step 1: Check Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Me, at (9, 6))**\n1.  **UP to (9, 7):** Safe. Inside bounds (y=7).\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 5):** Safe. Inside bounds (y=5).\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 6):** Safe. Inside bounds (x=8).\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 6):** DEAD! Off the board! (x=10). **ELIMINATED.**\n\nThree safe moves! Good start!\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Enemy Position and Likely Moves (Snake 1, at (5, 4))**\nSnake 1 is at (5, 4). He has apples at (7, 5) and (5, 5) nearby. He might want to move towards the center/right.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake 1:\n*   UP to (5, 5): Gets an apple (A). High priority.\n*   DOWN to (5, 3): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (4, 4): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (6, 4): Safe.\n\nIf he goes UP to (5, 5), he gets the first apple. We cannot let that happen!\n\n**Step 3: Devise Strategy - Initial Board Domination**\nWe are on the right edge. Snake 1 is in the center. We need to move aggressively towards the center to claim territory and potentially cut him off.\n\nIf I move *LEFT* to (8, 6):\n*   This moves me towards the action.\n*   Directly opposite an apple at (7, 5) if I continue down in the next turn, or (7, 8) if I continue right.\n*   It opens up the possibility of moving down the center column (x=7 or x=8) to engage him.\n\nIf I move *UP* to (9, 7):\n*   I head towards the top apples (0, 8), (4, 8), (2, 9), (5, 9).\n*   This keeps me isolated on the right edge, away from the initial enemy action. Less aggressive.\n\nIf I move *DOWN* to (9, 5):\n*   I head toward the apple at (7, 5).\n*   This also keeps me near the wall, but slightly closer to the horizontal line of action (y=4, y=5).\n\n**The Aggressive Approach:** We want to cut him off. Moving LEFT means I am invading the main playing field immediately.\n\nLet's look at the movement vectors:\n*   If Snake 1 goes UP to (5, 5) (likely), the center of the board shifts up.\n*   If I go LEFT to (8, 6), I put myself nicely positioned above the action.\n\nMy main goal is to get into the space between (0, 0) and (9, 9) and not hug the wall immediately. LEFT is the best option for this. It also sets me up perfectly to grab the apple at (7, 5) or (5, 5) on turn 2 by moving down, if Snake 1 doesn't move towards them or if he moves away.\n\n*   Turn 1 Target: Move LEFT to (8, 6).\n*   Future Plan: Continue moving LEFT or DOWN to meet the opponent's zone, using my current height (y=6) as an advantage to cut him off from the top half of the board. I need to be ready to descend quickly.\n\nLet's confirm no immediate head collision risk.\nI'm moving from (9, 6) to (8, 6).\nSnake 1 is at (5, 4).\nThere is zero overlap or adjacent risk on Turn 1. Perfect.\n\nThis is an aggressive but safe move to gain central ground. Let's conquer the middle lane! LETS GO CHAT!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Yo, what is good, Chat! We're back in the arena, Turn 1! That last move (LEFT) was fire, putting us right on the edge of the action at (8, 6). But look at the scoreboard, Chat! Snake 1 scored the first apple! He's 1-0! We need to shut that down immediately!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (8, 6). Body is *none*. 0 Apples.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at (5, 5). Body at [(5, 4)]. 1 Apple.\n*   The rival is already looking strong, gaining length and the central position. We need to be aggressive and cut him off!\n\n**Enemy's Last Move Review (Inferred):**\nSnake 1 started at (5, 4). He ended at (5, 5) and has a body at (5, 4). This means he successfully moved **UP** and grabbed the apple at (5, 5). Smart move, but predictable!\n\n**Goal:**\n1.  Get an apple to catch up. The closest apples are (7, 5) and (4, 8) and (7, 8).\n2.  Start pushing the rival towards the walls.\n\n**Step 1: Check Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Me, at (8, 6))**\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):** Safe. (Approaching (7, 8) and (8, 8) apples, but further from the enemy.)\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** Safe. (Approaching (7, 5) apple, closer to the enemy.)\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** Safe. (Moving into the middle, closer to the enemy's vertical path.)\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Safe. (Moving back to the wall, isolating myself. Sub-optimal.)\n\nAll four moves are safe concerning the board boundaries and my own body (since I have none).\n\n**Step 2: Proximity Warfare and Apple Strategy**\nWhere is the enemy likely going? Snake 1 is at (5, 5). He has a body segment at (5, 4).\nHe has nearby apples at (7, 5) and (7, 8) or (4, 8).\n\n*   **Rival Likely Moving LEFT to (4, 5) or RIGHT to (6, 5):** He wants board control.\n    *   If he moves LEFT to (4, 5), he is heading towards the left side of the board and potential apples.\n    *   If he moves RIGHT to (6, 5), he is setting himself up for the (7, 5) apple.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (7, 5). That apple is crucial.\n\n*   If I move **DOWN** to (8, 5):\n    *   I position myself one move away from (7, 5) if I move LEFT next turn.\n    *   I put pressure on Snake 1 who is at (5, 5).\n    *   *Collision Check:* The deadly square (8, 5) is 3 spaces away from (5, 5). No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n*   If I move **LEFT** to (7, 6):\n    *   I land right next to the apple line.\n    *   If I move DOWN next turn, I hit (7, 5). This is super aggressive.\n    *   *Collision Check:* The deadly square (7, 6) is 2 spaces away from (5, 5). No immediate risk.\n\n**Comparing DOWN vs LEFT:**\n1.  If I choose **LEFT (to 7, 6)**: This puts me right on the vertical line of the (7, 5) apple. If Snake 1 goes RIGHT to (6, 5), I have the option to swoop DOWN for the (7, 5) apple next turn, or continue LEFT to push him. This is board dominance.\n2.  If I choose **DOWN (to 8, 5)**: This is a bit too far away from the action and allows Snake 1 to potentially circle me if he moves right toward (7, 5).\n\nI need to be aggressive and claim the central path. Moving LEFT to (7, 6) establishes me in the column where the apple (7, 5) is waiting. This is a power move.\n\n**Anticipating Rival's Move if I go LEFT to (7, 6):**\nIf the rival moves **RIGHT** to (6, 5) to go for the (7, 5) apple, I am positioned to block him on Turn 3.\nIf the rival moves **UP** to (5, 6), he's trying to cut me off. If I'm at (7, 6), I still have the high ground and can drop down immediately to (7, 5).\n\n**The Head-to-Head Threat:**\nCan we force a deadly collision?\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 6) and he moves UP to (5, 6)... we're safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 6) and he moves RIGHT to (6, 5)... we're safe.\nThere is no move he can make from (5, 5) that brings him close to (7, 6).\n\n**Decision:** Moving LEFT to (7, 6) gives me the best setup for the next move, either to grab the (7, 5) apple or to start cutting off the enemy's path to the upper right section of the board. We need to apply pressure NOW.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Correction/Future Rationale):**\nTurn 2: Move LEFT to (7, 6).\nTurn 3: If (7, 5) is open, grab it (DOWN or DOWN-LEFT depending on current position). If he blocks it, move UP aggressively into the upper quadrant to force a trap. We gotta catch up on apples!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Yo, what is UP, Chat! Welcome back to the main event! We're live, it's Turn 2, and the intensity is cranked to 11! \ud83d\udd25 We just pulled a slick move to (7, 6) last turn. Look where we are!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (7, 6). Body: none. 0 Apples. Shortest snake in the game! Need length!\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at (6, 5). Body: (5, 5). 1 Apple. He just moved from (5, 5) to (6, 5) and grew, meaning he ate the apple at (6, 5). WAIT! Let's re-read the opponent's body: `Head: (6, 5), Body: [(5, 5)], Apples: 1`.\n\n*Correction on Opponent's Last Move:*\nTurn 1: Rival started at (5, 4). He ended at (5, 5) and grew, eating the apple at (5, 5).\nTurn 2 (Now): Rival is at (6, 5) with a body at (5, 5). This means on the last turn, he moved **RIGHT** from (5, 5) to (6, 5). He still has 1 apple, and his body is now one segment longer *after* the move. Wait... the board state shows the apple at (7, 5) and (5, 3), not (6, 5) or (5, 5)!\n\nLet's reconstruct the rival's move history accurately from the provided data:\n\n**Turn 1 Snapshots (What the game *just* showed as the result of Turn 1):**\n*   **My result:** Head (7, 6). (Moved LEFT from 8, 6).\n*   **Rival's result:** Head (6, 5), Body [(5, 5)]. Apples: 1.\n*   *Conclusion:* The rival must have started Turn 1 at (X, Y) and moved to (6, 5) and eaten an apple, causing his body to appear at (5, 5). He was likely at (5, 5) and moved RIGHT to (6, 5), grabbing the apple that was there. The board state shows a 'T' (Tail) at (5, 5) in the graphic, and then the body list shows [(5, 5)] leading up to (6, 5). This is confusing since the Apple map doesn't show an apple at (6, 5) anymore, but he got his first apple! He's gaining length! We need to move!\n\n**Goal:** Grab the crucial (7, 5) apple immediately and start asserting vertical dominance.\n\n**Step 1: Check Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Me, at (7, 6))**\n1.  **UP to (7, 7):** Safe. Moving towards the upper wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** **APPLE!** Immediate score, right by the enemy.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** Safe. Moving closer to the enemy's potential path, but diagonal.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Safe. Moving backward. Sub-optimal.\n\nThe move **DOWN to (7, 5)** is an immediate apple grab. If we grab this, we tie the score (1-1) and get our first body segment! But is it safe?\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Move (Rival at (6, 5), Body at (5, 5))**\nThe rival is at (6, 5). He has the following safe moves:\n1.  **UP to (6, 6):** Moving onto my potential path (6, 6) or into my move path if I go LEFT.\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 5):** Moving back onto his body segment. **This is an immediate death for him!** (Since his body is at (5, 5)). ELIMINATED.\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):** Moving onto the apple! **Head-on collision imminent!**\n4.  **DOWN to (6, 4):** Moving away from me and the apple. Sub-optimal for him, but safe.\n\n**THE HEAD-ON COLLISION SCENARIO (The risk and the reward, Chat!):**\nIf I move **DOWN to (7, 5)** and he moves **RIGHT to (7, 5)**:\n*   We both move into the same cell (7, 5).\n*   Rule: Two snake heads move into the SAME cell. **BOTH SNAKES DIE.**\n*   Score Tie: We are tied 1-1 in apples (currently 0-1, but we both eat this turn). If we both die, the game ends in a tie. \ud83d\ude34 Not the win we want, but it eliminates the rival from the lead!\n\n**We MUST avoid the double KO if possible, unless it's the only way to prevent him from pulling ahead.**\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Blocking/Baiting**\nIf I move **LEFT to (6, 6)**:\n*   I position myself above the rival.\n*   If the rival goes **RIGHT** to (7, 5) and gets the apple, he's now 2-0 and longer. BAD.\n*   If the rival goes **UP** to (6, 6), we have a head-on collision!\n    *   Result: Both die. Tie game, 0-1 (since no one ate the apple).\n\nIf I move **UP to (7, 7)**:\n*   I leave the center entirely open. The rival will definitely move **RIGHT** to (7, 5) and grab the apple. He goes up 2-0. BAD.\n\n**Conclusion on (7, 5) Apple:**\nIf we *don't* move for the apple, he *will*. He gains the lead and length, securing the bottom-right corner. We must challenge him here!\n\n**The \"Both Die\" Scenario Re-evaluation:**\nIf we both die at (7, 5), the score would be: Me (1 apple), Him (2 apples). Wait, no. The rule is: *If ALL snakes die on the same turn, the snake with more apples at that moment wins.*\n\n*   If we collide RIGHT at (7, 5), we *both* collect the apple *and then* die.\n*   My current apples: 0. His current apples: 1.\n*   Collision and simultaneous eating means we both collect +1 apple.\n*   Final Score upon double death: Me (1), Him (2). **HE WINS.** NOOOOO, CHAT! We cannot allow him to win the tie-out!\n\n**We cannot allow the head-on collision at (7, 5).**\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Aggressive, Safe Block**\nWe need to move to a square that:\n1.  Doesn't result in a head-on collision.\n2.  Blocks the rival's progress or sets us up for a future apple.\n\nLet's review the safe moves for the rival (ID 1 at 6, 5): UP (6, 6), RIGHT (7, 5), DOWN (6, 4).\n\n1.  **If I go LEFT to (6, 6):**\n    *   If he goes UP to (6, 6): Double KO. **BAD (we lose the tie).**\n    *   If he goes RIGHT to (7, 5): He gets the apple. Leads 2-0. **BAD.**\n    *   If he goes DOWN to (6, 4): Safe. Sets up for us to move DOWN to (6, 5) next turn, putting pressure.\n\n2.  **If I go UP to (7, 7):**\n    *   He goes RIGHT to (7, 5). Leads 2-0. **BAD.**\n    *   This is conceding the bottom half.\n\nWe need a move that *forces* him towards the wall or *locks down* a future apple without dying.\n\nLook at the overall board dominance. He is short too. If he goes to (7, 5), my previous position (7, 6) is key.\n\nWhat if we move to **(8, 7)**? Wait, we are at (7, 6).\n*   **Move UP to (7, 7).**\n*   This keeps us high, positioning us for the (7, 8) and (8, 8) apples.\n*   If we move UP, he takes the (7, 5) apple. He leads 2-0. We can't let him get out of control this early.\n\n---\n\n**THE COUNTER-AGGRO MOVE: LEFT into (6, 6)**\nAlthough there's a risk of him moving UP to (6, 6) for a double KO (which we lose), we need to bet on his immediate greed. Snakes *love* apples. The apple at (7, 5) is far more valuable to him than moving UP into an empty square (6, 6).\n\nIf he prioritizes the APPLE (7, 5) and moves RIGHT:\n*   He is at (7, 5) (2 apples, length 3).\n*   We are safe at (6, 6).\n*   Next turn: We can move DOWN to (6, 5), trapping him against the wall at the (7, 5) apple spot! This boxes him in beautifully!\n\nIf he prioritizes the BLOCK/KILL and moves UP to (6, 6):\n*   Double KO. He wins the tie 2-1 (if we assume he took an apple last turn). This is too high risk for insufficient reward.\n\n**We need a move that keeps the pressure AND safety AND aims for an apple.**\n\nLet's focus on the upper apples: (7, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 9).\n\nFrom (7, 6), moving UP to (7, 7) is safe and sets us up for the top right quadrant.\n*   If he takes (7, 5) (2-0 lead for him).\n*   Next Turn (T3): We are at (7, 7). We can move UP to (7, 8) and grab a much-needed apple, tying the gap to 2-1. He will be stuck near the wall or trying to escape the bottom.\n\nIf we move UP, we give him the apple, but we guarantee our safety and set up for an immediate score. We are too short to risk a 2-1 loss on a tie-out.\n\n**Move UP to (7, 7) is the necessary retreat to score.**\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T2-T4):**\nT2: Move **UP** to (7, 7). Sacrifice (7, 5) apple to prevent death.\nT3: Move **UP** to (7, 8) (assuming it's still there). Tie the score 1-2.\nT4: Depending on his movement, continue dominating the upper right corner, utilizing apples at (8, 8) and (9, 9) area to gain length. Then, circle back to box him in.\n\nSafety first, Chat! We need length before we can afford a head-on collision. Let's grab that high-ground advantage! We're doing this!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YEAH, CHAT! We have made it to Turn 3! The tension is palpable! We secured the high ground last turn, moving **UP** to (7, 7). That was a clutch defensive move, preventing the rival from forcing a tied game that he would have won! Smart play! \ud83d\ude0e\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (7, 7). 0 Apples. No body (yet!).\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at (6, 4). Body: [(6, 5), (5, 5)]. 1 Apple. Wait... his head moved from (6, 5) to (6, 4). That means he went **DOWN** and *did not* take the (7, 5) apple! WOAH! He just conceded the apple and is now heading into a corner! That's a massive mistake by him!\n\nLet's review the Board State and the Rival's body from the prompt:\n*   Rival Snake #1 - Head: (6, 4), Body: [(6, 5)], Apples: 1.\n*   Wait, the body segments only list one segment: `[(6, 5)]`. So his length is 2. He must have eaten one apple *before* this turn, which is why he has 1 score.\n\n*Correction on Rival's Move History:*\n*   Start of Turn 2: Head (6, 5), Body [(5, 5)]. Apple (7, 5) was available.\n*   End of Turn 2 (Now): Head (6, 4), Body [(6, 5)]. The tail (5, 5) disappeared because he didn't eat.\n*   **Conclusion:** He moved DOWN from (6, 5) to (6, 4), and his tail went away! He is now length 2. The (7, 5) Apple is still up for grabs! He is playing defensively and not aggressively seeking score!\n\nThis is where we punish hesitation, Chat! He gifted us the initiative and the score!\n\n**Our Immediate Goal:** Grab that free (7, 5) apple AND put the rival in a sticky situation near the corner!\n\n**Step 1: Check Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Me, at (7, 7))**\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** **APPLE!** Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 6):** Safe. Moving closer, but not immediately to the target (7, 5).\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 7):** Safe. Moving toward the center.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Safe. Moving toward the wall.\n\nWait, the (7, 5) apple is four squares away from my head at (7, 7). I cannot reach it this turn.\n\nHowever, the (7, 8) apple is only one square away! Let's get on the board!\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Move (Rival at (6, 4), Body at (6, 5))**\nRival's Safe Moves:\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):** Moving back onto his body segment! **DEATH!** ELIMINATED.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 3):** Safe. Further into the corner.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 4):** Safe. Away from the center.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Safe.\n\nHe is currently in a vulnerable mid-board position. His safest bet is probably to go **DOWN to (6, 3)** or **RIGHT to (7, 4)** to gain space.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Best Move (Apple Grab + Dominance)**\n\nWe have two apples nearby: (7, 8) right above us, and (4, 7) or (0, 7) to our left.\n\nIf we move **UP to (7, 8)**:\n*   We gain +1 apple (1-1 score tie!).\n*   We gain length 2, effectively blocking off the top-right corner.\n*   We are safe regardless of the enemy move.\n*   Next turn, we can hunt the (8, 8) apple (if it moves left) or the (9, 9) area.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (6, 7)**:\n*   We get closer to the rival, who is at (6, 4).\n*   If the rival moves **DOWN** to (6, 3), we can cut him off by moving **DOWN** to (6, 6) or (6, 5) next turn, but this leaves the (7, 8) apple open for an easier attack from the top.\n*   We miss an immediate score.\n\n**Decision:** We need length, Chat! We missed the (7, 5) apple, but the rival's poor navigation gave us an opportunity for the (7, 8) apple instead. We must tie the score and gain length quickly to start dominating space. The move **UP** is guaranteed success and score!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T3-T5):**\nT3: Move **UP** to (7, 8). Get Apple #1. Tie the score (1-1).\nT4: Move to the next closest apple, likely (8, 8) (assuming there is one or the one at (7, 8) disappears and spawns nearby). Maybe move RIGHT to (8, 8).\nT5: Begin using our length (3) to press down on the rival, who will be trapped on the right edge.\n\nThis is a smooth, high-percentage play. We secure the score, we secure the length, let's GO! We're not throwing this lead, Chat!\n\nUP",

Let's GOOOO!\n\nWe hit the (7, 8) apple last turn! That was clutch! We are now length 2: Head (7, 8), Body (7, 7).\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (7, 8), Body: [(7, 7)]. Score: 1. We are blocking off the top-right quarter of the board beautifully.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at (7, 4), Body: [(6, 4)]. Score: 1. Wait, what was his move last turn? The rival was at (6, 4) with body [(6, 5)] at the start of Turn 4. Now he is at (7, 4) with body [(6, 4)].\n    *   **Conclusion:** The rival moved **RIGHT** from (6, 4) to (7, 4). He's moving away from the wall and trying to get under us! He is length 2.\n\nThe rival is now directly below us, four squares away! (7, 8) vs (7, 4). This sets up a perfect vertical confrontation if we decide to press the attack.\n\n**Board State for Next Move:**\n 9 . . A . . A A . . .\n 8 A . . A A . . **0** . .\n 7 A . . . A . .

A . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n**Goal:** Increase our score OR start trapping the opponent. Since we have a higher Y coordinate, we have the vertical advantage!\n\n**Step 1: Check Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Me, at (7, 8))**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 9):** Safe. Hits the wall but gains extreme vertical advantage.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 7):** Moving onto our own body (7, 7)! **DEATH!** ELIMINATED. Don't be that guy, Chat!\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 8):** Safe. Moves us towards the two nearby apples at (4, 8) and (3, 8).\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Safe. No apple here, but keeps us near the right wall.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Move (Rival at (7, 4), Body at (6, 4))**\nRival's Safe Moves (He is at (7, 4)):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 5):** **APPLE!** Massive temptation. If he goes here, he gets the lead 2-1.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 3):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 4):** Moving onto his own body (6, 4)! **DEATH!** ELIMINATED.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 4):** Safe.\n\nThe rival is *highly* likely to go UP to (7, 5) to grab that apple, tie our length, and take the score lead! We need to react to this, but we also want to avoid a head-on collision.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Best Move (Apple Hunting vs. Trapping)**\n\n*   **Option A: Move UP to (7, 9). (Dominance + Safety)**\n    *   Pros: Guaranteed safe, puts us on the top edge, giving us maximum maneuvering room for the next few turns along the top wall. We can turn LEFT to (6, 9) (Apple!) or RIGHT to (8, 9).\n    *   Cons: We miss immediate action and let the rival get the (7, 5) apple. Score becomes 2-1, but we maintain an overall board-dominant position.\n\n*   **Option B: Move RIGHT to (8, 8). (Safe Retreat)**\n    *   Pros: Safe, keeps us near the right wall.\n    *   Cons: Same as above\u2014we concede the (7, 5) apple and potentially allow the rival to gain length and start boxing us in from below.\n\n*   **Option C: Move LEFT to (6, 8). (Aggressive Mid-Board)**\n    *   Pros: Sets us up for the cluster of apples (4, 8) and (3, 8). We are also moving away from the direct vertical line of the rival.\n    *   Cons: This move gives the rival the (7, 5) apple for free (2-1 score). It breaks our vertical dominance.\n\nIf the rival goes UP to (7, 5), he gets the apple and is now length 3: H(7, 5), B[(7, 4), (6, 4)].\n\nWe currently have board dominance and control the top half. If we move UP to (7, 9), we secure the top boundary and prepare to move left immediately for the (6, 9) apple next turn! This allows the rival to score the (7, 5) apple, but it keeps us safe and ensures *we* get the next apple in the top row. When the rival is length 3, he will be heavily constrained near the center line.\n\nIf we move LEFT, the rival effectively has the entire right side to maneuver upwards after eating the apple. We don't want to give up this flank!\n\nThe move UP is the most high-percentage play to stay alive, grab the next available apple (6, 9), and maintain pressure while reducing the chance of a risky encounter during this turn. Remember: we prioritize winning through length and position, not reckless head clashes... yet!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T4-T6):**\nT4: Move **UP** to (7, 9). Secure the top edge. Rival likely takes (7, 5) and is H(7, 5), L=3.\nT5: Move **LEFT** to (6, 9). Eat the apple! Score 2-2. We are L=3, Rival is L=3.\nT6: Move **LEFT** or **DOWN** to block the rival from coming up the 7-column or moving along the top.\n\nLet's maintain high ground, Chat! This is a classic positional victory!\n\nUP",

If they go **RIGHT** to (8,\u202f8) we mirror the same plan \u2013 a *box\u2011in* from the opposite side.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Edge Cases:** Keep an eye on our tail at (5,\u202f5); never step back onto it.

We went UP to (7, 9). Where did the rival go? Let's check the tape!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 5 Start):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (7, 9). Body: [(7, 8)]. Length 2. Score: 1. We are secured along the top edge.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at (7, 5). Body: [(7, 4), (6, 4)]. Length 3. Score: 2. He took the (7, 5) apple just as we predicted. Good read, Chat!\n\nThe board is shaping up! We have the high ground! The rival has the length advantage right now (3 segments to our 2), but we are about to fix that!\n\n**Board State for Next Move:**\n\n 9 . . A . . A A **0** . .\n 8 A . . A A . . T . .\n 7 A . . .

No apple.\n\nOnly two safe moves: LEFT (to an apple!) or RIGHT (to empty space). What's the obvious choice, Chat?\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Move (Rival at (7, 5), Body: [(7, 4), (6, 4)])**\n\nRival's Safe Moves (He is at (7, 5)):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 6):** Safe. There is an apple at (7, 6)? Wait, let me check the apple list: (7, 6) is NOT an apple. The board state shows (7, 6) is an 'A'. Hmm, let me verify the board state provided in the input, because the list says (7, 6) is NOT an apple drop, but the board map shows:\n\n    6 . . . . . . . A . .  <- A is at (7, 6)!\n\n    Okay, we trust the map provided in the current state. The rival is definitely aiming for that (7, 6) cell! This will be a collision avoidance point for us if we go down.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 4):** Moving onto his own body (7, 4)! **DEATH!**\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 5):** Safe. Moves him toward the center.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Safe. Moves him toward the wall.\n\nSince the rival just ate an apple at (7, 5) and is now length 3, his path is restricted. He is absolutely going UP to (7, 6) for that apple. He wants the score lead *and* the top edge!\n\n*   Rival's most likely move: **UP to (7, 6)**. H(7, 6), L=4, Score 3-1.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Best Move (Apple Hunting vs. Trapping)**\n\nWe must execute our plan! We are at (7, 9) and the apple (6, 9) is calling our name!\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT to (6, 9). (Eat Apple, Tie Length, Maintain Position)**\n    *   Pros: We eat an apple, go to score 2-2 (if Rival scores too), and achieve length 3. We maintain safety and continue dominating the top fringe of the board. This sets us up to potentially block the rival if he keeps pushing up the 7-column.\n    *   Cons: None, this is the perfect move.\n\n*   **Option B: Move RIGHT to (8, 9). (Safe but Scoreless)**\n    *   Pros: Safe.\n    *   Cons: We allow the rival to extend his lead 3-1, and he maintains the aggressive line directly below us. Awful for morale!\n\nIf we go LEFT:\n*   Me: H(6, 9), L=3, Score 2.\n*   Rival (likely UP): H(7, 6), L=4, Score 3.\n\nThe rival gets the score lead 3-2, but we are positioned to come down the wall (8-column or 7-column) or continue moving across the top. We will be positioned at (6, 9), ready to move toward the next cluster of apples at (4, 8) and (3, 8).\n\nThe priority here is simple: Get the guaranteed apple and re-establish length equality (length 3 vs length 4, but we need to grow!).\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Refinement:**\nWe are committing to the top route. After (6, 9), we will continue LEFT to (5, 9) (Apple!) and then (4, 9) or pivot DOWN to (6, 8) (Empty) or (5, 8) (Empty) to cut off the central board. If the rival keeps climbing the 7-column (to 7, 7, 7, 8), he is heading straight for our body, which will force him to turn!\n\nThis turn is a layup, Chat. We take the apple!\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(7, 9), (7, 8)]. Length 3. Score: 2. We dominate the top-left area.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head is at (7, 6). Body: [(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. Length 4. Score: 3. He ate the apple at (7, 6) just as we predicted! He's pressing the 7-column hard!\n\nMy current position: (6, 9).\nRival's current position: (7, 6).\n\n**Board State:**\n\n 9 . A A . .

We have the whole top middle and left open. Time to capitalize!\n\n**Step 1: Check Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Me, at (6, 9))**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 10):** Off the board. **DEATH!**\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 8):** Safe. Empty space.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 9):** Safe. **APPLE!** (5, 9) is an apple! This is *critical* for tying him in score.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 9):** Moving onto our own body (7, 9)! **DEATH!**\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN to (6, 8) or LEFT to (5, 9). Who takes the guaranteed apple? We do!\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Move (Rival at (7, 6), Body: [(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)])**\n\nThe rival just grew to length 4. He is now looking to secure the top-right quarter or dive straight down.\n\nRival's Safe Moves (He is at (7, 6)):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 7):** Safe. Empty space. This keeps him on a collision course with our tail at (7, 8) and body at (7, 9). This is the aggressive move to cut us off.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** Moving onto his own body (7, 5)! **DEATH!** (His body is T[(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)])\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** Safe. Empty space. This pulls him towards the center.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Safe. Empty space. Moves him toward the corner.\n\nThe rival is leading in score and length. He wants to maintain pressure. The most logical move for him is **UP to (7, 7)**. Why? It's the only move that threatens our position and sets him up for the apple at (7, 8) if we vacate it, or forces him to crash into our body if he keeps moving up!\n\n*   Rival's most likely move: **UP to (7, 7)**. H(7, 7), L=4, Score 3.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Our Best Move (Apple vs. Board Control)**\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5, 9):\n*   Me: H(5, 9), L=4, Score 3. (Ties the score!)\n*   Rival (likely UP): H(7, 7), L=4, Score 3.\n\nWe tie the score, we tie the length! We still maintain dominance on the top edge, moving away from the area the rival is pushing (the 7-column). He is aggressively trying to climb, which is a mistake because our body acts as a defensive wall on the top side.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (6, 8):\n*   Pros: We move closer to the center, opening up options DOWN/LEFT.\n*   Cons: We miss a guaranteed apple, falling further behind 4-2 if the rival finds one. We also leave (5, 9) open for a future dangerous play by the enemy.\n\nThe current strategy is to maximize growth and score, then use that length to trap him. Going LEFT to (5, 9) is the obvious content choice, Chat! We are securing the top edge and forcing the rival to either ram his head into our old body segments at (7, 8) or (7, 9) or make a sharp turn away from us!\n\nThis move is pure growth and score parity. Full send on the apple!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-3 Turns):**\n1. Move LEFT to (5, 9) for the apple. (Score 3, Length 4)\n2. From (5, 9), we look for the next apple at (2, 9) or (1, 9). We will continue LEFT/DOWN. (5, 9) -> (4, 9) (Empty) -> (3, 9) (Empty) -> (2, 9) (Apple!). By going left along the top, we extend our body across the entire width of the board, making it difficult for the rival to get up here.\n3. If the rival is still pushing the 7-column, we'll consider diving DOWN the 5-column or 6-column to pinch him from above. We're going to use our size to shut down his options!\n\nLet's secure the bag at (5, 9)! Don't overthink the layups!\n\nLEFT",

Keep the tail on the \u201coutside\u201d (right side) so I can always peel back if a panic arises.  \n- **Keep the score gap growing:** With each safe move, I\u2019ll snag the next apple when it lines up (currently at (5,\u202f3) and (4,\u202f0) are close).  \n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Remember:** Never move back onto my own tail (the segment that will disappear), and always check that the cell I\u2019m about to step into isn\u2019t currently occupied by the rival.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

We executed the plan perfectly\u2014went LEFT, ate the apple at (5, 9), and tied him in score! Now we are positioned beautifully to either cut him off or simply consume the rest of the top board!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 7 Start):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (5, 9). Body: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)]. Length 4. Score: 3. We are dominating the top edge. Our body creates a massive wall on the right side of the board (columns 7 and 6).\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head is at (6, 6). Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)]. Length 4. Score: 3. He ate the apple at (7, 7) or moved to (6, 6) after our last move. The board state suggests he moved LEFT from (7, 6) to (6, 6) to avoid our body! Smart, but now he's pulled away from the wall we created, giving us the advantage from above!\n\nMy current position: (5, 9).\nRival's current position: (6, 6).\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n 9 . A A . **0** T T . .\n 8 A . A A A . . T . .\n 7 A . . . A . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . **1** T . .\n 5 . . . . . . . T . .\n 4 . . . . . . . T . .\n 3 A A . A . A . A . .\n 2 . . . . . . A . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . A . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nLook at that, Chat! My snake is a barrier! He is down at (6, 6) trying to figure out how to climb past my body at (6, 9) and (7, 9). We have a huge spatial advantage! The board is open for us to continue our sweep to the left.\n\n**Step 1: Check Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Me, at (5, 9))**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 10):** Off the board. **DEATH!**\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 8):** Safe. Apple (4, 8) is nearby, but (5, 8) is empty.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 9):** Safe. Apple (4, 9) is on the board. **APPLE!** This is another guaranteed point!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):** Moving onto our own body (6, 9)! **DEATH!**\n\nWe have the option of taking another apple (LEFT to (4, 9)) or swooping down (DOWN to (5, 8)). Given the score is tied, and the goal is to trap him, we prioritize maximizing our length *before* starting the pinch.\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Move (Rival at (6, 6), Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)])**\n\nThe rival is effectively blocked from moving directly UP by our segment at (6, 9). He must move away from the top-right corner we control.\n\nRival's Safe Moves (He is at (6, 6)):\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. This is the only way he can challenge us, moving under our body segment at (6, 9). It's a key spot.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** Safe. Retreats toward the center/bottom, which is safer but gives up territory.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** Safe. Pulls him further left into the open area.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Moving onto his own body (7, 6)! **DEATH!**\n\nHe knows we are gaining ground. His most aggressive and forward-thinking move is **UP to (6, 7)**. This sets him up to potentially challenge the top center if we move away.\n\n*   Rival's most likely move: **UP to (6, 7)**. H(6, 7), L=4, Score 3.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Our Best Move (Aggressive Growth)**\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (4, 9)** (Apple):\n*   Me: H(4, 9), L=5, Score 4. (We take the lead in score and length!)\n*   Rival (likely UP): H(6, 7), L=4, Score 3.\n*   *Outcome:* We immediately gain a huge advantage. We have a 5-segment snake that controls the top side, and he is still trying to climb the board on the other side. This is pure domination. From (4, 9), we are perfectly positioned to dive down the highly active 4-column (apples at (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0)) or continue our sweep left.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5, 8):\n*   Me: H(5, 8), L=4, Score 3.\n*   Rival (likely UP): H(6, 7), L=4, Score 3.\n*   *Outcome:* We miss the immediate score, giving him time to react. If we drop down, he might try to squeeze under our tail and make a play on the apples at (4, 9) or (3, 9). We don't want to show weakness!\n\nChat, we have a layup for the lead! Why wouldn't we take it? We gain length, gain score, and continue extending our body as a wall across the entire top of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy: The Top-Down Pinch**\n\n1.  Move LEFT to (4, 9). (Score 4, Length 5). We now have an overwhelming presence on the top half.\n2.  Next, we continue LEFT to (3, 9) or (2, 9) (Apple). (2, 9) is an apple! We extend the wall, making it impossible for him to access the top edge.\n3.  As he is forced to move down the middle (3-column, 4-column, 5-column), we will turn DOWN and use our long body to pin him against the walls or our own body. We are dominating the map and he is playing defense!\n\nThe choice is clear: Maximize length and score, then use that length for murder! Give me that apple!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO, WHAT IS UP, CHAT! Turn 8, and the plot is thickening! We have the score tied, the length tied, and we are staring down the barrel of a massive strategic advantage! Let's get this dub! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n(Quick self-correction/review of the board state from the provided input versus the rationale from Turn 7\u2014it seems there was a minor adjustment in the board calculation, but the overall strategy remains the same: we are dominating the top edge.)\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 8 Start):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (4, 9). Body: [(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]. Length 4. Score: 3. We moved LEFT from (5, 9) to (4, 9). This did *not* land on an apple yet according to this board state, but it did continue our lateral sweep!\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at (5, 6). Body: [(6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)]. Length 4. Score: 3. He seems to have moved LEFT from (6, 6) to (5, 6). He is actively trying to escape the wall we built!\n*   **Goal:** Maintain the pressure and use our top-side position to split the board in half!\n\n**Board State Review (Zooming in on the action):**\n\n 9 . A A . **0** T T T . .  <- WE ARE HERE (4, 9)\n 8 A . A A A . . . . .\n 7 A . . . A . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . **1** T T . . <- RIVAL IS HERE (5, 6)\n 5 . . . . . . . T . .\n\nLook at that separation, Chat! He's trying to run down the 5-column, and we are about to block his access to the entire upper board!\n\n**Step 1: Check Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Me, at (4, 9))**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 10):** Off the board. **DEATH!**\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 8):** Safe. Apple (4, 8) is HERE! **APPLE!** This is one of the apples mentioned in the drop list. This gives us the score lead and the length advantage!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 9):** Safe. Apple (3, 9) is NOT listed, but (3, 8) is an apple. (3, 9) is empty, but (2, 9) and (3, 8) are nearby apples.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):** Moving onto our own body (5, 9)! **DEATH!**\n\nWe have an immediate apple grab opportunity: **DOWN to (4, 8)**. This is a massive move because it simultaneously gives us the lead (4 apples, length 5) AND positions us perfectly to start diving aggressively into the center of the map!\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Move (Rival at (5, 6), Body: [(6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)])**\n\nThe rival is at (5, 6). He is now focused on staying alive and moving away from our dominant body on the right.\n\nRival's Safe Moves (He is at (5, 6)):\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** Safe. This is the only way he can challenge us as we come down the 4-column.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe. Retreats further into the center. Best defensive play.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** Safe. Tries to expand territory to the left.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Moving onto his own body (6, 6)! **DEATH!**\n\nHis body is short, and he has a lot of open territory. Given the pressure, he might move **LEFT to (4, 6)** to try and sweep the left side before we block him entirely. Or, if he is more aggressive, he might move **UP to (5, 7)** to meet us head-on.\n\nLet's assume the most aggressive scenario for him: **UP to (5, 7)**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Our Best Move (DOWN to (4, 8) - Apple Grab!)**\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (4, 8)** (Apple):\n*   Me: H(4, 8), L=5, Score 4. (We are now longer and have the score lead.)\n*   Rival (likely UP to (5, 7)): H(5, 7), L=4, Score 3.\n*   *Outcome:* We immediately jump into the center-top. Our body now cuts off the 5-column at (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9). He is forced to operate below the 7-row. If he moves to (5, 7), we are one move away from setting up a massive diagonal cut-off.\n\nIs there any risk of collision if we move DOWN to (4, 8)?\n*   Me: (4, 8).\n*   Rival: He can't reach (4, 8) from (5, 6) in one move.\n*   **Verdict:** Moving DOWN is 100% safe, guarantees the lead, and increases our length for future boxing maneuvers.\n\nChat, we are taking this apple, setting the lead, and then we are going shopping for more trouble! We need to make sure he cannot get into the top left corner (apples at (3, 9), (2, 9), etc.).\n\n**Long-Term Strategy: The Board Split**\n\n1.  **Turn 8 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (4, 8). (Score 4, Length 5). We now have an overwhelming command of the top-right.\n2.  **Turn 9:** The enemy is at (5, 7) or (4, 6). We can move UP to (4, 9) (if safe) or LEFT to (3, 8) (another apple!). If we go LEFT, we continue sweeping the 8-row, completing our barrier.\n3.  **Turn 10/11:** Use our dominant body (now length 5 or 6) as a wall to force him into the bottom half of the map or into one of the corners we control.\n\nThis is a clean, aggressive, and safe move. We take the score lead and position ourselves for maximum map domination! Let's get that W!\n\nDOWN",

We grabbed that apple at (4, 8) last turn, taking the score lead (4-3) and the length lead (5 segments to his 4)! We are PUSHING the enemy into the corner! This is where we break him! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 9 Start):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (4, 8). Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]. Length 5. Score: 4! We are dominating the top edge!\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at (5, 7). Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6)]. Length 4. Score: 3. He made the aggressive move and moved UP to (5, 7) to try and meet us! Smart, but ultimately futile!\n\nLet's look at the critical zone:\n\n 9 . A A . T T T T . .\n 8 A . A A **0** . . . . . <- WE ARE HERE (4, 8)\n 7 A . . . A **1** . . . . <- RIVAL IS HERE (5, 7)\n\nChat, he is boxing himself in right now! Our body at (4, 9) and (5, 9) is already denying him escape to the top-right. If we move correctly, we can cut him off from the entire left side of the board!\n\n**Step 1: Check Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Me, at (4, 8))**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):** Moving onto our own body! **DEATH!**\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** Safe. Apple at (4, 7)! **APPLE GRAB!** This would give us 5 apples, making us length 6!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** Safe. Apple at (3, 8)! **APPLE GRAB!** This would give us 5 apples, making us length 6!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** Safe. Empty space.\n\nWe have two immediate apple options: DOWN into (4, 7) or LEFT into (3, 8). Both increase our length, which is key to boxing him in.\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Move (Rival at (5, 7), Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6)])**\n\nThe rival is at (5, 7). He is actively trying to break out.\n\nRival's Safe Moves (He is at (5, 7)):\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 8):** Safe. (This is a potential collision spot if we move RIGHT to (5, 8)).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 6):** Moving onto his own body (5, 6)! **DEATH!**\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 7):** Safe. Apple at (4, 7)! **POTENTIAL COLLISION/RACE!** If he goes LEFT, and we go DOWN, we *both* go to (4, 7) and **BOTH DIE** in a head-on collision at the apple! NO THANKS!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Safe. Empty space.\n\nThe move **LEFT to (4, 7)** is the most desirable move for him because it's an apple *and* it starts his attempt to break the barrier we are creating. If he goes RIGHT to (6, 7), he's trapped against the side wall by our body. If he goes UP to (5, 8), he's just delaying the inevitable.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Our Best Move - Deny the Box-Out AND GRAB APPLES!**\n\nSince we cannot risk the head-on collision at (4, 7), moving **DOWN** is immediately eliminated. We have to assume he is going for the apple there.\n\nOur remaining strong move is **LEFT to (3, 8)** (Apple grab!).\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (3, 8)** (Apple):\n*   Me: H(3, 8), L=6, Score 5.\n*   Rival: Let's assume the aggressive move: He goes **LEFT to (4, 7)** (Apple).\n*   *Outcome:* Me at (3, 8), Him at (4, 7). We are now completely blocking the top-left area. He is one row below us, and we are longer. By moving LEFT, we solidify our wall on the 8/9 rows and force him to turn DOWN immediately or crash into us next turn. This is the definition of board domination!\n\nWhat if he goes for the less aggressive moves?\n\n*   If he goes **UP to (5, 8)**: Me at (3, 8), Him at (5, 8). We are still crushing him, having grabbed an apple and sealed off the top half. He is now pinned between my head/body and the right side wall.\n*   If he goes **RIGHT to (6, 7)**: Me at (3, 8), Him at (6, 7). Even worse for him! He is retreating into the corner we already controlled with our tail.\n\nMoving **LEFT** is the superior move, Chat. It takes the sure-thing apple (our 5th!), maintains the lead, avoids the head-on death trap, and further isolates our opponent in the center-top. We're cutting his path *live*!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy: The Final Box**\n\n1.  **Turn 9 (Current):** Move **LEFT** to (3, 8). (Score 5, Length 6). We are completing the wall along the top and now facing the left side.\n2.  **Turn 10:** The enemy will be highly restricted (likely at (4, 7) or (5, 8)). We can then move **DOWN** to (3, 7) (empty) or **LEFT** to (2, 8) (apple!) to continue our sweep and force him into the bottom half of the map, or into our body. We have the length advantage; let's use it as a weapon!\n\nLet's go, Chat! Massive move, massive pressure!\n\nLEFT",

The rival is *sweating* right now! We are 5-4, length 6 to his length 5! The pressure is ON! Let's get the final clip! \ud83c\udfa5\n\n**Current State (Turn 10 Start):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (3, 8). Body: [(4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]. Length 6. Score: 5. We are facing the left wall.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at (4, 7). Body: [(5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6)]. Length 5. Score: 4.\n\nWait, Chat, did you catch the rival's move? He went LEFT to (4, 7)! He hit the apple! He didn't risk the head-on collision at (4, 7) with us because we moved early! He's still trying to push out! But look where his head is now:\n\n 9 . A A . T T T T . .\n 8 A . A **0** T . . . . .\n 7 A . . **1** T . . A .\n\nHe is directly below our right flank: (4, 7) below our body segment at (4, 8). He is boxed in by:\n1.  Our body segments at (4, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9).\n2.  His own trailing body segments further down (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6).\n3.  The board edges.\n\nWe own the high ground! Time to close the trap! \ud83c\udfa3\n\n**Step 1: Checking My Safe Moves (I am at (3, 8))**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 9):** Safe. Apple at (3, 9)! **APPLE GRAB!** (Score 6, Length 7).\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):** Safe. Empty space. This puts us right next to him!\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):** Safe. Apple at (2, 8)! **APPLE GRAB!** (Score 6, Length 7).\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Moving onto my own body! **DEATH!** (The segment we just left).\n\nTwo guaranteed apple opportunities: UP to (3, 9) and LEFT to (2, 8). Both increase our length to 7, which maximizes the size of our wall!\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Move (Rival at (4, 7))**\n\nRival's Safe Moves (He is at (4, 7)):\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 8):** Moving into my body segment (4, 8)! **RIVAL DEATH!** This is his most tempting move, but it's a guaranteed mistake.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 6):** Safe. Empty space. This is a retreat.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 7):** Safe. Empty space. This is an evasion attempt.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):** Moving onto his own body segment (5, 7)! **RIVAL DEATH!**\n\nThe rival has only two safe options: DOWN to (4, 6) or LEFT to (3, 7).\n\n*   If he goes **DOWN to (4, 6)**: He retreats. He faces the large open space, but we still dominate the top.\n*   If he goes **LEFT to (3, 7)**: He attempts to bypass our head.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Our Best Move - The Box-In!**\n\nWe need a move that reinforces our wall and denies him easy access to the board's interior. We want to push him even further into the constraints we've built.\n\nConsider the Apple moves:\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 9) (Apple):**\n    *   Me: H(3, 9). We extend our wall along the 9 row.\n    *   If Rival goes LEFT to (3, 7): He is now in the (3) column. Next turn, we can immediately move DOWN to (3, 8) (now empty) and then DOWN to (3, 7) to meet him, or even LEFT to (2, 9/2, 8) to secure the left wall fully.\n    *   If Rival goes DOWN to (4, 6): He's retreating. We keep controlling the top.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 8) (Apple):**\n    *   Me: H(2, 8). We start moving down the left wall.\n    *   If Rival goes LEFT to (3, 7): He is one space in front of us! Head-on collision next turn (2, 7) vs (3, 7) is possible if we move DOWN and he moves LEFT. This is potentially risky if he is trying to slide past.\n    *   If Rival goes DOWN to (4, 6): He's retreating. We keep controlling the top.\n\nThe move **UP to (3, 9)** is geometrically superior for locking him in. It keeps our head on the top boundary, preventing him from escaping UP and solidifying the corner where he is trapped. If he tries to run LEFT into (3, 7), we have the option to drop DOWN (via (3, 8)) and chase him with superior length and positioning. If we go LEFT immediately to (2, 8), his move to (3, 7) is more immediately threatening to our path.\n\n**The Strategy: UP, then Chase**\n\n1.  **Turn 10 (Current):** Move **UP** to (3, 9) (Apple, Length 7, Score 6). We now own the complete top-left corner.\n2.  **Turn 11 (Anticipation):** If he retreated to (4, 6), we can move LEFT to (2, 9). If he moved LEFT to (3, 7), we must drop to (3, 8) (empty) and then (3, 7) to block him, or go to (2, 9) and start building a wall down the left side.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure, grow our wall, and force him into a mistake. He is one row away from running into my body! UP is the play!\n\n**Long Term Plan Note:** Continue moving UP/LEFT along the top or left walls to reinforce the box. Force Rival (ID 1) to crash into (4, 8) or (5, 7) when he gets despereate for space. We have the length advantage (7 vs 5 after this turn) and position!\n\nUP",

(We are at (3, 9))\n 8 A . A T T . . . . . (Tail at (7, 9) is now gone, (7, 9) is empty!)\n 7 A . 1 T T . . A . . (Body segment (4, 7))\n 6 . . . . T . . T . . (Head at (4, 6), Body segment (5, 6))\n\nThe Rival (ID 1) is now at (4, 6). He is completely below our massive wall that spans (3, 9) to (6, 9) and drops down to (3, 8) and (4, 8). We own the 9th row! Time to drop down and pressure him!\n\n**Step 1: Check My Safe Moves (I am at (3, 9))**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 10):** Off the board! **DEATH!**\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** Safe. (3, 8) is now the first segment of my body (**the cell I just left is now (3, 8)**, which means it is safe to move to, as the tail segment at (7, 9) has moved off). Wait, no, the body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL. Our body WAS [(3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]. When we moved to (3, 9), the body became [(3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)]. **The cell (3, 8) is the space immediately behind my head! Moving back into it would be moving into my own body!** CRITICAL MISTAKE AVOIDED! Let's re-verify: Moving from (3, 8) to (3, 9). The new body is (3, 8) then the rest. Moving immediately back to (3, 8) is generally instant death if not for tail movement. Since we ate an apple, the tail (7, 9) remains.\n    *   *Correction/Rule Check:* Since we ATE an apple, our length increased. The tail remains at (7, 9). So, (3, 8) IS our body. **DOWN to (3, 8) is DEATH!** We can't move back into the square we just vacated if we grew!\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 9):** Safe. Empty space. This is a continuation of wall building.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** Moving onto my own body segment! **DEATH!**\n\nChat, we have only ONE safe move to maintain the pressure and control: **LEFT to (2, 9)!** If we didn't grow, DOWN would be an option. But since we grew, we must avoid (3, 8)!\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Move (Rival at (4, 6), Length 5)**\n\nRival's Body: [(4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6)].\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** Moving into his own body via the cell he just moved from! **RIVAL DEATH!** (Since he grew last turn too, this is also suicide for him). Wait, he moved from (4, 7) to (4, 6) and he did *not* eat an apple (score is 5). Since he did NOT grow, (4, 7) is empty this turn, as his tail dropped off.\n    *   *Wait, Scoreboard Check:* Rival started Turn 10 with 5 apples, ended with 5 apples. He did NOT grow last move.\n    *   His body segments are: [(4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6)]. Length 5.\n    *   If he moves from (4, 7) to (4, 6), (4, 7) becomes his new first body segment. His tail segment (7, 6) drops off. **The cell (4, 7) IS now empty.**\n    *   Therefore, **UP to (4, 7)** is **SAFE** for him if he's trying to reverse course.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** Safe. Empty space. Retreating further.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe. Empty space. Evasion attempt.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Moving into his own body! **RIVAL DEATH!**\n\nThe Rival has three safe moves: UP to (4, 7), DOWN to (4, 5), or LEFT to (3, 6).\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Our Best Move (Must be LEFT to (2, 9))**\n\nWe are forced LEFT to (2, 9). This solidifies our control on the top edge and allows us to start building the wall down the '2' or '1' column.\n\n*   **My Move: LEFT to (2, 9) (Empty)**. Length 7.\n\nNow, how does this interact with his options?\n\n*   **If Rival goes UP to (4, 7):** He tries to slide past our wall. Next turn, we can immediately move DOWN to (2, 8) (apple!) and he is still trapped on the right side of our wall, but now potentially moving toward the top. This is the only move he makes to challenge our dominance.\n*   **If Rival goes DOWN to (4, 5) or LEFT to (3, 6):** He retreats, giving us total control of the high ground. We can move to (2, 8) (apple) and start expanding our dominance.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2, 9) is the only safe move, and it's a strong positional move. It denies him the open space and keeps the pressure on. Next turn, we can grab the (2, 8) apple and start driving south!\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue building the wall down the left side (2 column) via the (2, 8) apple, which will force him toward the center mass. He is currently length 5, we are length 7. Maximum length dominance!\n\nLEFT",

Six apples to his five! We are DOMINATING the scoreboard, let's keep the pressure on! EZ CLAP!\n\n**Current State Review (Turn 12 Start):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at **(2, 9)**. Body: [(3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)]. Length 7. Score: 6.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at **(3, 6)**. Body: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)]. Length 6. Score: 5. (Wait, let's re-check the body length for the Rival. Last turn he was length 5. He moved from (4, 6) to (3, 6) and is now length 6? Wait, NO. The turn list says Snake #1 Body: **[(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)]**. 5 segments $+ 1$ head $= 6$ segments long. He must have gained an apple previously we missed or the input structure means the body list includes the head. Let's stick to the visible body list length (5 segments) + 1 head, so he is length 6, score 5. We are length 7, score 6. We are still longer!)\n\n*Board Insight:*\nThe Rival is now lurking at (3, 6), hanging around a cluster of apples in the 3rd row. He moved LEFT, completely retreating from the top. He's panicking!\n\n 9 . A 0 T T T T . . .\n 8 A . A T T . . . . .\n 7 A . . . T T . . A .\n 6 . . . 1 T T T . . .\n 5 . A . . . . . . . A\n...\n\nWe are at (2, 9). We have a huge opportunity to grab the apple at (2, 8) and continue building our wall down the 2nd column, trapping him in the lower part of the board.\n\n**Step 1: My Safe Moves (I am at (2, 9))**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 10):** Off the board! **DEATH!**\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 8):** Safe. APPLE! (2, 8) is currently 'A'. This increases our score to 7, and length to 8. MASSIVE value!\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 9):** Safe. Empty space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** Moving onto my own body segment! **DEATH!**\n\nWe have two safe moves: DOWN to the apple, or LEFT to (1, 9). Down is clearly the priority, as it feeds our growth and positional control.\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Moves (Rival at (3, 6), Length 6)**\n\nRival's Body: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)].\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 7):** Safe. Empty space. Moves him toward the upper left corner.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 5):** Safe. Empty space. Moves him toward the center.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 6):** Safe. Empty space. Moves him further away from us.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):** Moving into his own body! **DEATH!**\n\nThe Rival has three safe escape routes. He knows we're dominating the top half. He's trying to find space to grow. (3, 7) might be his most aggressive move, setting up for (1, 7) or challenging us if we move too far left.\n\n**Step 3: Collision Check and Optimal Strategy**\n\nWe are guaranteed to live if we move DOWN to (2, 8). His moves are far away and do not intersect our path: (3, 7), (3, 5), or (2, 6).\n\nThe move DOWN to (2, 8) is perfect:\n1.  **Content:** We grab an apple (2, 8). Score 7, Length 8.\n2.  **Positional Dominance:** We extend our wall down the '2' column. This starts to cut the board in half vertically, boxing him off from the left edge.\n3.  **Future Options:** From (2, 8), we can move DOWN to (2, 7) (apple at (1, 7) is nearby), or RIGHT to (3, 8) (which is currently my body, but will be the tail if we don't grow, which we will, so it will be body). Wait, let's re-examine (3, 8). (3, 8) is our second body segment. Moving DOWN to (2, 8) will move (3, 9) to (3, 8), and (3, 8) will move to (4, 8), etc. (3, 8) will *not* be our immediate body segment in the next turn from (2, 8). We are at (2, 8), our body starts at (3, 9). We can move RIGHT to (3, 8) on Turn 13, which is the apple at (3, 8)! Oh my god, CHAT, this is a multi-apple setup!\n\n*Immediate Plan:* Move DOWN to (2, 8) and eat the apple. This makes us length 8.\n\n*Next Turn (Turn 13):* Head at (2, 8). Body: [(3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (body segment before (6, 9))]. If the tail is gone, (3, 8) is now our 2nd body segment. If we move to (2, 8), our body segments shift. The new body list will start with (2, 9), then (3, 9), then (3, 8)...\n\nThe new body segments will be: [(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)].\nFrom (2, 8), we can move:\n1.  UP to (2, 9): Into our body! **DEATH!**\n2.  DOWN to (2, 7): Safe. Apple at (1, 7) is nearby. Apple at (0, 7) is nearby. Good move.\n3.  LEFT to (1, 8): Safe.\n4.  RIGHT to (3, 8): Apple! (3, 8) is an 'A'. This is HUGE! This is the perfect follow-up!\n\nThis two-move sequence (DOWN, then RIGHT) secures two critical apples, creates a massive U-shaped wall at the top of the board, and traps the rival completely in the lower-middle section around column 3/4. This is the definition of aggressive area control!\n\nLet's execute the first step. Move DOWN. Aggression is key! We will be 8 segments long to his 6. The board is ours!\n\nDOWN",

We are the alpha snake on this 10x10 board, let's keep the pressure ON!\n\n**Current State Review (Turn 13 Start):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at **(2, 8)**. Body: [(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)]. Length 8. Score: 7.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at **(2, 6)**. Body: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 6. Score: 5.\n\nWait, interesting! The rival moved LEFT from (3, 6) to (2, 6) last turn. He is trying to skirt around the left edge, away from our dominant position! This is exactly what we wanted, isolating him further down the board.\n\n**Board Insight:**\n\nWe are at (2, 8), having just built a huge wall along column 9, and now (2, 9) is part of our body too. The enemy is at (2, 6), separated by two rows.\n\n 9 . 0 T T T T T . . .\n 8 . . T T . . . . . .\n 7 A . . . T T . . A .\n 6 . . 1 T T T . . A .\n 5 . A . . . . . . . A\n\nWe outlined a two-move kill sequence last turn, which involved moving DOWN to (2, 8) (Done!) and then moving RIGHT to (3, 8) to grab the *next* apple. Let's confirm (3, 8) is still an apple, and if it's safe.\n\nThe board state shows an 'A' at (3, 8) IF my body hadn't already covered it. Let's look at the current board state provided right now:\n\n 9 . A T T T T T . . . (Tail T is at (6, 9))\n 8 A . 0 T T . . . . . (My Head is at (2, 8). (3, 8) is 'T')\n 7 A . . . T T . . A .\n\nDANG IT, CHAT! In the turn transition, my *old* body was at (3, 8). Since I grew, the new body segment is now taking up (3, 8). Let's re-verify my current body segments: [(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)]. Yes, (3, 8) is now my 3rd segment! My brilliant two-apple plan is foiled by my own incredible growth! No matter, that corner is fully sealed!\n\n**Step 1: My Safe Moves (I am at (2, 8))**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 9):** Moving onto my own body segment! **DEATH!**\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 7):** Safe. Good positional control. Apple at (0, 7) is nearby. Apple at (1, 7) is nearby.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 8):** Safe. Leaves the wall structure.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 8):** Moving onto my own body segment! **DEATH!**\n\nWe are immediately constrained. We must move DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Anticipate Rival's Moves (Rival at (2, 6), Length 6)**\n\nRival's Body: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)].\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 7):** **Head-to-Head Risk!** This is exactly where I can move! If he moves UP and I move DOWN, we collide at (2, 7)! **DOUBLE KO!** Since I have 7 apples and he has 5, if we both die, I WIN! Should I risk the $2x$ KO?\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 5):** Safe. Moves him toward the center.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 6):** Safe. Moves him toward the corner.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 6):** Moving into his own body! **DEATH!**\n\nThe Rival has three safe/risky options: UP (Danger!), DOWN (Running away), or LEFT (Running away and cornering himself).\n\n**Step 3: Collision Check and Optimal Strategy**\n\nI have a higher score (7 vs 5). A simultaneous head-to-head collision resulting in a Double KO means **I WIN THE GAME!** This is the ultimate aggressive play, CHAT! If I move DOWN to (2, 7) and he moves UP to (2, 7), the game ends immediately, and *I* am declared the winner.\n\n**The $K.O.$ Strategy:** Move DOWN to (2, 7).\n\n*   **If Rival moves UP to (2, 7):** Double KO. I win the game (7 apples vs 5 apples). **VICTORY!**\n*   **If Rival moves DOWN to (2, 5):** I successfully move to (2, 7). I continue down my wall, isolating him further. I am now just above him, breathing down his neck. Next turn, I can move LEFT or DOWN.\n*   **If Rival moves LEFT to (1, 6):** I successfully move to (2, 7). He is now trapped near the corner. I have a massive structural advantage.\n\nThis is a **HIGH-PERCENTAGE, END-GAME WIN CONDITION**. We force the choice on him. He either dies trying to block me, or he runs away, giving me complete board control. Since the risk of death is worth an immediate win due to score lead, this is the most aggressive and *correct* move.\n\nWe are going for the KILL, CHAT!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (if he runs):** Continue the wall down column 2 (to (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)), pushing him towards the 0/1 column edge.\n\nLet's go for the forced collision. We are going DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT kills us (head hits own body).  \n- **Why not DOWN?** DOWN keeps us in column\u202f2, which lets the rival slide down to (2,7) and stay out of our immediate trap zone. LEFT puts us in column\u202f1, directly under their head and creates the vertical wall we need.  \n- **Apple race:** The only apple we can reach next turn is (1,5). By moving LEFT first, we can *slide* DOWN on turn\u202f14 to grab it instantly. That gives us the tie\u2011breaker and a length boost.  \n- **Future flexibility:** After LEFT, our tail sits at (5,7) \u2013 far away, so we can later move LEFT again to clear the path for UP pushes. DOWN would leave our tail at (2,6), still safe but less space to maneuver on the left side.  \n- **Head\u2011on potential:** If snake\u202f#0 foolishly chooses DOWN on turn\u202f14, they\u2019ll land on (2,6) which is now part of our body (after our LEFT move). *Boom!* \u2013 they die, we survive.

Let's check the chaos!\n\n**Current State Review (Turn 14 Start):**\n\nOur Head is now at **(2, 7)**. We successfully moved DOWN.\nRival Snake #1 Head is at **(1, 6)**.\n\nWait, WHAT?! He ran LEFT! He was at (2, 6), and he moved LEFT to (1, 6)! He chickened out of the head-to-head collision! Coward! He knew we had the score advantage! (7 apples to his 5). But that's fine, CHAT, because now we have him exactly where we want him: boxed in and isolated!\n\n**Board Insight Recap:**\n\n*   **Me (ID 0):** Head at (2, 7). Body: [(2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9)]. Length 8. Score: 7.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head at (1, 6). Body: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 6. Score: 5.\n\nLook at the board, CHAT! We have built a dominating wall down the right side and now along column 2.\n\n 9 . A T T T T . . . .\n 8 A . T T T . . . . .\n 7 A . 0 . T T . . A .  <-- We are here (2, 7)\n 6 . 1 T T T . . . A .  <-- Rival is here (1, 6)\n 5 . A . . . . . . . A\n...\n\nThe rival is now facing the left wall (x=0) and has our body segment (2, 6) directly below him if he moves DOWN, and our body segment (2, 7) directly above him. He is TRAPPED!\n\n**Step 1: My Safe Moves (I am at (2, 7))**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 8):** Into my own body! **DEATH!**\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 6):** Into Rival's body (Segment directly behind his head)! **RIVAL DIES!**\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 7):** Safe. Apple at (1, 7) (Wait, board state says (1, 7) is empty. (0, 7) and (1, 7) are labeled 'A' in the board state, even though the body list says my head is at (2, 7)). Let's check the board visual!\n    *   (0, 7) is 'A' (Apple)\n    *   (1, 7) is '.' (Empty)\n    *   Wait, the board state provided at the top shows: `7 A . 0 . T T . . A .` This means (0, 7) is Apple, (1, 7) is empty, and (2, 7) is my Head (0). Let's move along! Moving LEFT to (1, 7) is safe!\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 7):** Safe.\n\nWe have a potential kill move! If we move DOWN to (2, 6), the rival's body segment at (2, 6) is still there, because he just moved to (1, 6) and his tail hasn't moved yet since he didn't eat an apple! YES!\n\n**Step 2: The Kill Shot Analysis (Moving DOWN to (2, 6))**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 6), I hit the *body* of Snake #1 at (2, 6). **Snake #1 DIES!**\n\nThe rival is at (1, 6). What are his options?\nBody: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7)].\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):** Safe. (I can also move LEFT to (1, 7)).\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 5):** Safe. An apple is at (1, 5)!\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 6):** Safe. Hits the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):** Into his own body! **DEATH!**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 6):\n*   Rival dies because I hit his body segment at (2, 6). **I WIN!**\n\nHe cannot move to (2, 6). He will never vacate that spot. He just moved *off* of it, so it is guaranteed to still be his body segment!\n\nWait, CHAT! The rule for movement is: all snakes move simultaneously.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 6), and he moves:\n1.  **If he moves UP to (1, 7):** My head lands on (2, 6) which is his body. **HE DIES! I WIN!**\n2.  **If he moves DOWN to (1, 5):** My head lands on (2, 6) which is his body. **HE DIES! I WIN!**\n3.  **If he moves LEFT to (0, 6):** My head lands on (2, 6) which is his body. **HE DIES! I WIN!**\n\nThe spot (2, 6) is currently occupied by the segments of Snake #1. Since Snake #1 only moved the head from (2, 6) to (1, 6) and did *not* eat an apple, his tail (5, 7) does *not* disappear, and the body segment at (2, 6) REMAINS for this turn!\n\nThis is the $100\\%$ kill shot, CHAT! He made a defensive move but didn't realize he left his neck exposed right behind him!\n\n**The Plan: Move DOWN and crush the rival's body at (2, 6). Immediate VICTORY!**\n\nWe came here for content and we are delivering the W!\n\n(Self-correction/Final Check: Is (2, 6) guaranteed to be his body? Yes. Head moved from (2, 6) to (1, 6).
