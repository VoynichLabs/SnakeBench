Unfortunately (1,0) is currently occupied by my own body segment, so on paper every move kills me, but there\u2019s no other legal direction, so I\u2019m forced to keep pressing toward the apples in hopes the segment configuration shifts in my favor.\n\nPlan: once the tail moves I\u2019ll continue sweeping right along y=0 and clear the remaining bottom apples before Snake #0 can trim my path.\n\nRIGHT",
