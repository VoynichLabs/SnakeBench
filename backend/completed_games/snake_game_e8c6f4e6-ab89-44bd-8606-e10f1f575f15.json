If it moves **UP**, it will collide with you at (5, 2) or (5, 3) next turn.\n3. **Apples are spread out.** The closest apple to you is at (2, 5) (distance = 3 cells diagonally or 4 cells orthogonally). The other apples are farther away.\n4. **No body segments yet.** This means you can move freely without risking self-collision (except if you move directly backward into your own tail, but since you have no tail, this isn\u2019t a concern yet).\n\n### **Safe Moves Evaluation:**\n1. **UP (5, 3) \u2192 (5, 4):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: If the enemy moves **UP**, it will reach (5, 2) next turn, leaving (5, 3) empty. This could be a trap if you move **UP** now and the enemy moves **UP** next turn, forcing you to retreat or risk collision.\n   - Apple proximity: No apple directly above, but moving **UP** keeps you closer to the apple at (2, 5) (though still not directly reachable).\n\n2. **DOWN (5, 3) \u2192 (5, 2):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: If the enemy moves **UP**, it will collide with you at (5, 2) next turn. This is a **high-risk move** because it could lead to an immediate head-on collision.\n   - Apple proximity: No apple directly below, but moving **DOWN** could block the enemy\u2019s **UP** move (if you stay at (5, 2), the enemy cannot move **UP** without dying). However, this move is too risky for now.\n\n3. **LEFT (5, 3) \u2192 (4, 3):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: The enemy is below you, so it won\u2019t interfere with your **LEFT** move unless it moves **LEFT** or **RIGHT** toward you. This is a **low-risk move**.\n   - Apple proximity: The apple at (2, 5) is still reachable in 2 moves (**LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 UP**), but moving **LEFT** first keeps you closer to the center of the board, avoiding corners where you might get trapped.\n   - Alternative: This move doesn\u2019t immediately threaten the enemy, but it keeps you flexible for future turns.\n\n4. **RIGHT (5, 3) \u2192 (6, 3):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: The apple at (6, 2) is directly below you (if you move **RIGHT**). This could be a good target if you move **DOWN** next turn.\n   - Apple proximity: The apple at (6, 2) is 1 cell away (**DOWN** after **RIGHT**). This is the **closest apple** (distance = 1).\n   - Risk: The enemy could move **RIGHT** to (6, 1) next turn, but this doesn\u2019t directly threaten you unless it moves **UP** toward you. However, moving toward the apple at (6, 2) is tempting.\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy:**\n- **Avoid immediate collisions.** The enemy\u2019s **UP** move is the biggest threat. Moving **DOWN** would invite a head-on collision next turn if the enemy moves **UP**.\n- **Prioritize reachable apples.** The apple at (6, 2) is the closest (1 move away if you go **RIGHT**). However, moving **RIGHT** now could also allow the enemy to cut you off if it moves **RIGHT** next turn.\n- **Stay flexible.** Moving **LEFT** first keeps you in a position where you can react to the enemy\u2019s movement without getting trapped. You can then reassess the apple positions and enemy threats next turn.\n- **Watch the enemy\u2019s head.** If the enemy moves **UP**, it will force you to move away from (5, 2) or (5, 3). If it moves **LEFT** or **RIGHT**, it might try to flank you.\n\n### **Move Selection:**\n- **UP** is safe but doesn\u2019t immediately help you reach an apple.\n- **DOWN** is unsafe (invites collision).\n- **LEFT** is safe and keeps you flexible for future turns.\n- **RIGHT** is safe and could lead to an apple next turn, but it\u2019s riskier because the enemy could move toward you.\n\n**Best choice:** **LEFT** to (4, 3). This avoids immediate threats, keeps you flexible, and doesn\u2019t commit you to a path that could be blocked by the enemy.\n\n---\nLEFT",

Its body is now [(6, 1), (6, 2)].\n   - If the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (7, 2) or **LEFT** to (5, 2) next turn, it will grow and potentially block paths.\n3. **Apples are still spread out.** The closest apple to you is now at (2, 5) (distance = 2 cells diagonally or 3 cells orthogonally).\n   - The apple at (8, 6) is farther but could be a long-term target.\n4. **No body segments yet.** You can still move freely without risking self-collision.\n\n---\n\n### **Safe Moves Evaluation:**\n1. **UP (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 5):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: Keeps you moving upward toward the apple at (2, 5). However, the enemy could move **RIGHT** or **LEFT** to (7, 2) or (5, 2), which might block future paths.\n   - Apple proximity: The apple at (2, 5) is reachable in 2 moves (**UP \u2192 UP \u2192 LEFT** or **UP \u2192 LEFT \u2192 UP**).\n   - Risk: Moving **UP** again could lead you toward the enemy if it moves **UP** again, but it cannot move **UP** without hitting its own body.\n\n2. **DOWN (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: Moving **DOWN** could be useful to avoid getting trapped in the upper half of the board.\n   - Apple proximity: No apple directly below, but it could be useful to reposition if the enemy moves aggressively.\n   - Risk: Moving **DOWN** doesn\u2019t help you reach an apple but keeps you flexible.\n\n3. **LEFT (4, 4) \u2192 (3, 4):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: Moving **LEFT** could lead you toward the apple at (2, 5) (**LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 UP**).\n   - Apple proximity: The apple at (2, 5) is now reachable in 2 moves (**LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 UP**).\n   - Risk: The enemy could move **LEFT** or **RIGHT** to cut you off, but it\u2019s unlikely to be directly threatening now.\n\n4. **RIGHT (4, 4) \u2192 (5, 4):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: Moving **RIGHT** brings you closer to the enemy\u2019s potential path (if it moves **RIGHT** to (7, 2)).\n   - Apple proximity: No apple directly to the right, but it could be useful to avoid getting trapped in the left half of the board.\n   - Risk: Moving **RIGHT** could bring you closer to the enemy\u2019s future path, but it\u2019s not immediately threatening.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy:**\n- **Avoid immediate threats.** The enemy is at (6, 2) with a body segment at (6, 1). It cannot move **UP** again, so it will likely move **RIGHT** or **LEFT** to avoid collision with itself.\n  - If it moves **RIGHT** to (7, 2), it will grow and could block paths to the right.\n  - If it moves **LEFT** to (5, 2), it will grow and could block paths to the left.\n- **Prioritize reachable apples.** The apple at (2, 5) is the closest (2 moves away if you go **LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 UP** or **UP \u2192 UP \u2192 LEFT**).\n- **Stay flexible.** Moving **LEFT** first could help you reach the apple at (2, 5) in the next few turns without getting trapped by the enemy.\n- **Watch the enemy\u2019s head.** If the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (7, 2), avoid moving toward (7, 4) or (7, 3) next turn. If it moves **LEFT** to (5, 2), avoid moving toward (5, 4) or (5, 3).\n\n---\n\n### **Move Selection:**\n- **LEFT** is safe and could lead you toward the apple at (2, 5) (**LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 UP**).\n- **UP** is safe but doesn\u2019t immediately help you reach an apple and keeps you in a less advantageous position if the enemy moves **RIGHT**.\n- **RIGHT** is safe but could bring you closer to the enemy\u2019s future path.\n- **DOWN** is safe but doesn\u2019t help you reach an apple and keeps you in a less advantageous position.\n\n**Best choice:** **LEFT** to (3, 4). This move keeps you flexible, avoids immediate threats, and positions you well to reach the apple at (2, 5) in the next few turns.\n\n---\n**Long-term plan for future turns:**\n- If the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (7, 2), avoid moving toward (7, 4) or (7, 3) next turn. Instead, prioritize reaching the apple at (2, 5) or another safe apple.\n- If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 2), avoid moving toward (5, 4) or (5, 3) next turn. Instead, prioritize reaching the apple at (2, 5) or another safe apple.\n- Keep an eye on the apple at (8, 6) as a potential long-term target if other apples are blocked.\n\nLEFT",

If it moved **UP** to **(7, 3)**, its new body would be [(6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3)].\n  - But the current board state shows the enemy at **(8, 3)** with body [(8, 2), (7, 2)]. This suggests the enemy moved **RIGHT** from **(7, 2) \u2192 (8, 2)** and then **UP** to **(8, 3)** (but snakes cannot move twice in one turn). I must clarify the enemy's movement.\n  - From the last move, the enemy was at **(7, 2)** with body [(6, 2), (7, 2)]. If it moved **UP** to **(7, 3)**, its body would be [(6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3)].\n  - If it moved **RIGHT** to **(8, 2)**, its body would be [(7, 2), (8, 2)].\n  - The current board state shows the enemy at **(8, 3)** with body [(8, 2), (7, 2)]. This is impossible unless the enemy moved **UP** from **(7, 2) \u2192 (8, 2)** (but this would require it to move **UP** and **RIGHT** simultaneously, which is not allowed).\n  - **Correction:** The enemy's last move must have been **UP** from **(7, 2) \u2192 (8, 2)**, but the body is now [(8, 2), (7, 2)], which is impossible. I must re-evaluate.\n  - **Re-evaluation:** The enemy's last move was likely **RIGHT** from **(7, 2) \u2192 (8, 2)**, and its body is [(8, 2), (7, 2)]. It cannot move **LEFT** or **DOWN** without colliding with its own body.\n  - **Current Position:** The enemy is at **(8, 3)** with body [(8, 2), (7, 2)]. This suggests the enemy moved **UP** from **(7, 3) \u2192 (8, 3)** (but this contradicts the last move information). I must assume the current board state is accurate.\n  - The enemy is now at **(8, 3)** with body [(8, 2), (7, 2)]. This means it likely moved **UP** from **(7, 3) \u2192 (8, 3)** and grew, occupying **(8, 2)** as its new body segment.\n\n**Apples at:** (1, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 8), (8, 0).\n- **Closest apple:** (1, 8) (distance = 3 cells **LEFT** and 3 cells **UP**).\n- **Other reachable apples:** (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 0) are farther but could be targeted if the enemy moves aggressively.\n\n---\n\n### **Safe Moves Evaluation:**\n1. **UP (2, 5) \u2192 (2, 6):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: Moving **UP** brings you closer to the apple at (1, 8) but doesn\u2019t eat it immediately.\n   - Apple proximity: (1, 8) is still 3 cells away.\n   - Risk: None, but it doesn\u2019t eat an apple.\n\n2. **DOWN (2, 5) \u2192 (2, 4):**\n   - **Collision:** Your body is at (2, 4), so moving **DOWN** would hit your own body and kill you.\n   - **Eliminate:** This move is unsafe.\n\n3. **LEFT (2, 5) \u2192 (1, 5):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: Moving **LEFT** brings you closer to the apple at (1, 8) (distance = 3 cells **UP**).\n   - Apple proximity: (1, 8) is now directly above you.\n   - Risk: None, but it doesn\u2019t eat an apple immediately.\n\n4. **RIGHT (2, 5) \u2192 (3, 5):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: Moving **RIGHT** brings you farther from the apple at (1, 8) but could be useful to reposition if the enemy moves aggressively.\n   - Apple proximity: No apple directly to the right, but it could be useful to reposition if needed.\n   - Risk: None, but it doesn\u2019t help you reach an apple immediately.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Snake Analysis:**\n- **Enemy snake (ID 1):** Head at **(8, 3)**, body: [(8, 2), (7, 2)].\n  - The enemy cannot move **LEFT** or **DOWN** without colliding with its own body.\n  - Possible moves: **UP** to (8, 4) or **RIGHT** to (9, 3).\n  - If the enemy moves **UP** to (8, 4), it will grow and occupy (8, 4).\n  - If the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (9, 3), it will grow and occupy (9, 3).\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy:**\n- **Prioritize reaching the apple at (1, 8).** It is the closest apple and reachable in 3 moves.\n- **Avoid getting trapped.** If the enemy moves aggressively, ensure you can still reach other apples like (8, 6) or (8, 7).\n- **Stay flexible.** Moving **LEFT** to (1, 5) is the most direct path to (1, 8) (next move **UP** to (1, 6), then **UP** to (1, 7), then **UP** to (1, 8)).\n- **Prefer moves that don\u2019t waste time.** Eating the apple at (1, 8) will give you a point and grow your snake.\n\n---\n\n### **Move Selection:**\n- **UP** is safe but doesn\u2019t help you reach an apple immediately.\n- **LEFT** is safe and brings you closer to the apple at (1, 8).\n- **RIGHT** is safe but doesn\u2019t help you reach an apple immediately.\n- **DOWN** is unsafe.\n\n**Best choice:** **LEFT** to (1, 5).\n\n---\n**Long-term plan for future turns:**\n- After moving **LEFT** to (1, 5), prioritize moving **UP** to (1, 6) on the next turn.\n- Then move **UP** to (1, 7) and finally **UP** to (1, 8) to eat the apple.\n- If the enemy moves aggressively toward you, consider repositioning to avoid head-on collisions.\n- Avoid getting trapped in corners or dead-ends.

It is the closest apple and reachable in 2 more moves (**UP** twice).\n- **Avoid getting trapped**. If the enemy moves **UP** to (8, 6), ensure you can still reach other apples or reposition safely.\n- **Stay flexible**. If the enemy moves toward your path, consider repositioning to avoid head-on collisions.\n- **Prefer moves that don\u2019t waste time**.

Let me clarify the body order:\n  - On Turn 11, your snake was **Head: (2,7), Body: [(2,8), (1,8)]** (since body is head-to-tail, and the last segment is the tail).\n  - Moving **LEFT** from (2,7) to (1,7) means your new head is (1,7), and your body becomes [(2,7), (2,8)] (tail is now (2,8)).\n  - Wait, no: the body is the list of segments *after* the head. So if your snake was **Head: (2,7), Body: [(2,8), (1,8)]**, then the full snake was [(2,7), (2,8), (1,8)] (head-to-tail). After moving **LEFT**, the new head is (1,7), and the body is [(2,7), (2,8)] (tail is now (2,8)).\n  - So your snake is now: **Head: (1,7), Body: [(2,7), (2,8)]**.\n\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: **(9, 7)** (assuming it moved **UP** from (8,8) to (9,8) on Turn 11, but the board state shows its head at (9,8) on Turn 11. Wait, no: the board state on Turn 11 shows its head at (9,8) and body as [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]. This is inconsistent because the body should not include the head. Let me correct this:\n  - On Turn 11, your last move info shows Snake #1's head at (9,8) and body as [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]. This is impossible because the body cannot include the head. I think the correct interpretation is:\n    - **Head: (9,8), Body: [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]** (from Turn 11's last move info).\n    - So on Turn 11, Snake #1 was **Head: (9,8), Body: [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]**.\n    - On Turn 12, its head moves to one of the four adjacent cells: (9,9), (9,7), (8,8), or (10,8) (invalid).\n    - Its body will shift accordingly (e.g., if it moves **DOWN** to (9,7), its new body is [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]).\n\n#### **Apples Remaining:** (8, 0), (6, 4), (3, 1), (7, 1), (9, 5)\n\n#### **Safe Moves from (1, 7):**\n1. **UP (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 8):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: Moving **UP** could bring you closer to apples like (6,4) or (7,1) but is not optimal for reaching (3,1).\n   - Risk: None, but may not align with short-term goals.\n\n2. **DOWN (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: Moving **DOWN** is the next step in the path to (3,1) (as per your last plan).\n   - Risk: None, but must ensure enemy doesn\u2019t block you later.\n\n3. **LEFT (1, 7) \u2192 (0, 7):**\n   - Safe: No collision with enemy or board boundary.\n   - Future implications: Moving **LEFT** keeps you on the path to (3,1) but may not be the most efficient.\n   - Risk: None, but could lead to getting trapped near the left edge.\n\n4. **RIGHT (1, 7) \u2192 (2, 7):**\n   - Collision: Your body is at (2,7). Moving **RIGHT** would hit your own body (since (2,7) is the second segment of your snake).\n   - **Eliminate.**\n\n#### **Enemy Snake Possible Moves (From (9, 8)):**\n- On Turn 11, Snake #1's head was at (9,8) and body was [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)].\n- Possible moves for Snake #1 on Turn 12:\n  - **UP** to (9,9)\n  - **DOWN** to (9,7) (but (9,7) is adjacent to your head at (1,7), so no direct threat yet)\n  - **LEFT** to (8,8)\n  - **RIGHT** to (10,8) (invalid, off the board)\n- If Snake #1 moves **LEFT** to (8,8), its new body will be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)].\n- If Snake #1 moves **DOWN** to (9,7), its new body will be [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)] (but (9,7) is not adjacent to your snake yet).\n\n#### **Long-Term Plan for Future Turns:**\n- **Short-term goal:** Reach the apple at (3,1) as soon as possible.\n- **Path to (3,1) (from Turn 12):**\n  - Move **DOWN** to (1,6) (Turn 12).\n  - Move **LEFT** to (0,6) (Turn 13).\n  - Move **DOWN** to (0,1) (Turn 14).\n  - Move **RIGHT** to (1,1) (Turn 15).\n  - Move **RIGHT** to (2,1) (Turn 16).\n  - Move **RIGHT** to (3,1) (Turn 17) to eat the apple.\n- **Alternative:** If the enemy blocks your path, switch to reaching the apple at (6,4) or (9,5).\n- **Avoid getting trapped:** Your snake is currently near the left edge (x=0). Moving **DOWN** and **LEFT** keeps you flexible for future turns.\n\n#### **Move Selection:**\n- **DOWN** to (1,6) is the best choice as it continues the path to the apple at (3,1) while keeping you safe and flexible.\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s assume:\n    - On Turn 12, Snake #1 moved **DOWN** from (9,8) to (9,7), and its body is now [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)].\n    - On Turn 13, its head is at (9,7), and it can move:\n      - **UP** to (9,8).\n      - **DOWN** to (9,6).\n      - **LEFT** to (8,7).\n      - **RIGHT** to (10,7) (invalid).\n    - If it moves **DOWN** to (9,6), its body becomes [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)].\n    - If it moves **LEFT** to (8,7), its body becomes [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7)] (but (8,7) is already in its body, so this is invalid). Wait, no: its body is [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)], so moving **LEFT** to (8,7) would collide with its own body. Thus, **LEFT** is invalid.\n    - If it moves **UP** to (9,8), its body becomes [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)].\n    - If it moves **DOWN** to (9,6), its body becomes [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)].\n\n#### **Apples Remaining:**\n- (8, 0), (6, 4), (3, 1), (7, 1), (9, 5).\n- **Closest apple:** (3,1) (distance: ~5 moves).\n- **Alternative apples:** (7,1) (distance: ~4 moves), (6,4) (distance: ~6 moves).\n\n#### **Safe Moves from (1, 6):**\n1. **UP (1, 6) \u2192 (1, 7):**\n   - Collision: Your body is at (1,7).
