My movement options need to be carefully considered, especially since I must navigate around enemy snakes and avoid any potential collisions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my thoughts:\n\n1. **Current Position:** I\u2019m at (3, 7).\n2. **Apples Nearby:** The apples I can realistically aim for in future turns are quite a distance away, but moving towards (3, 3) seems within reach over the coming turns if I can get into a more advantageous position.\n3. **Enemy Snake Position:** There's an enemy snake at (5, 4) with its body at (5, 5) directly below it.

It may be a valid move, but doesn\u2019t progress my strategy.\n- **DOWN (to (3, 6)):** This is valid and not towards any danger but is not strategic for the apple collection.\n- **LEFT (to (2, 7)):** This move keeps me away from the enemy snake and positions me to potentially get to (3, 3) or (4, 2) in the next turns.\n- **RIGHT (to (4, 7)):** This moves me back to my previous position and is not allowed.\n\n### Deciding on a Move:\nGiven the options, moving LEFT to (2, 7) appears to be the most strategic. It keeps me safe from enemy threats and also opens the path downwards in the next moves which can lead towards the apples at (3, 3) afterward. \n\n### Immediate Strategy:\n1. Move LEFT to (2, 7) and then assess the next move towards the apples over subsequent turns, considering the snake\u2019s positions.\n2. Maintain awareness of the enemy\u2019s positions to ensure I don't inadvertently approach danger.\n\nThus, my decided next move is: **LEFT**."

The choice of staying away from the enemy snake (particularly its head and body chemistry) is crucial for safety, as consecutive moves could either branch towards apples or further retreat away from danger.\n\nSo as previously determined, my next move will be:\n\n**LEFT**."

However, it moves me sideways on the X axis.\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 5))**: This is actually my last position. Going back there would not accomplish anything.\n\n### Analysis:\nConsidering safety and strategy, I need to anticipate following moves without heading directly toward a dangerous clash with the enemy snake. The left or down options seem to maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake while giving room for my next strategic move.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- The closest apple is (0, 2), which is a more significant distance away and requires moving left across many unoccupied tiles. \n- (6, 4) seems unreachable in this immediate turn without a maneuvering strategy first.\n\n### Potential Strategy:\nAs I plan the next moves, I should start focusing on distancing myself from the enemy snake and gradually moving toward an apple while carefully analyzing the movement options and potential actions of the opponent.\n\nGoing **DOWN to (2, 4)** allows me to remain on the current column, which can still provide options for my next move the following turn without immediate danger while preparing for indirect navigation toward apples.\n\n**Selected Move: DOWN**."

It moves me further down but still allows future choices.\n3. **LEFT to (1, 4)**: Moves left into an empty cell. At some point, I may want to work towards (0, 2) or find a path towards (6, 4), but this doesn\u2019t contribute to immediate gains.\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 4)**: Would result in running into the enemy snake (their head is at (5, 4)) or occupy the same space as the enemy, which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Best Moves\nI need to ensure safety from running into the enemy snake or my body. Accessing any apples will be my primary goal, so I want to move strategically.\n\n- The **UP move** keeps options open and has potential to explore vertical corridors.\n- **DOWN** leads me into (2, 3), which is safe, but moving directly downwards doesn\u2019t make progress towards apples.\n- **LEFT to (1, 4)** focuses on potential navigation downwards toward some later opportunities.\n- **RIGHT** is not an option as mentioned (encounters enemy).\n\n### Strategic Decision\nIn light of the above evaluation, since both UP and LEFT are valid and safe, I prefer going UP to (2, 5) not only because it opens further upward paths, but it also keeps my options flexible for potential upcoming turns. \n\nAdditionally, staying in the same X position allows me to reevaluate moves when considering the next round and what the enemy may do next.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe safest and most strategic move is to go **UP to (2, 5)**.\n\nDecided next move: **UP**."

The nearby apples are located at (0, 2), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 8), and (9, 2). The enemy snake (Snake #0) is at (7, 3) with its body extending vertically along column 4.\n\n#### Available Moves from (2, 6)\n\n1. **UP to (2, 7)**:\n   - The cell at (2, 7) is empty, so this move is valid. It gets me a step closer vertically but doesn't bring me closer to any apples immediately.\n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 5)**:\n   - Moving down to (2, 5) is not beneficial, as it would put me back to my previous position, which the game rules state is not allowed.\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 6)**:\n   - This move is also valid since the cell (1, 6) is empty. This does not lead me directly to any apples but allows flexibility.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 6)**:\n   - The cell (3, 6) is my current position. Moving right would not be productive, as I would remain where I am.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n- Moving **UP (to (2, 7))** keeps me on the same column and opens potential movement options in the next turn.\n- Moving **LEFT (to (1, 6))** allows me to head into an empty space with options for the next move.\n- Moving **DOWN** is not an option since it's illegal to go back to my previous position.\n- I cannot move RIGHT as it will keep me in the same place.\n\n### Strategic Consideration\n\nI need to weigh how each move positions me relative to the apples while maintaining safety from the enemy snake. \n\nChoosing to move UP to (2, 7) keeps me closer to the center column where potential apples may arise in the next turns, while also possibly providing a safe buffer against the enemy snake. It also ensures I'm exploring vertical options for future moves without boxing myself in. \n\n### Decision\nThus, my decided next move is **UP**."

Although it's an empty cell, it doesn't bring me closer to any apples.\n- **LEFT to (1, 7)** is also a valid option, as it opens up further movement possibilities and keeps me flexible in response to enemy actions.\n- Moving **DOWN is not an option**, and **RIGHT does not change my position.**\n\n### Strategic Consideration\nApples remain distant, and I need to reach positions that will help me either secure an apple soon or open myself up for more advantageous moves. At this point, moving LEFT (to (1, 7)) may open up more favorable positions for my next move, allowing me to potentially advance towards reaching column 0, where an apple is located at (0, 2).\n\nAlthough UP keeps me moving vertically, it does not strategically position me closer to an apple or advantageous cell.\n\n### Decision\nBased on this reasoning, I choose to move LEFT to (1, 7), positioning myself well for the next steps while also avoiding the enemy snake's direct territory.\n\nThus, my decided next move is: **LEFT**."

The next best approach is essential given the presence of the enemy snake situated at (9, 3) and its body occupying multiple cells.\n\n### Possible Moves from (0, 7):\n1. **UP to (0, 8)**: \n   - This cell is empty. \n   - Still not progressing toward the apple but allows for possible further vertical movement later.\n\n2. **DOWN to (0, 6)**: \n   - This cell is also empty. \n   - Similar to moving up, it doesn't directly progress toward the apple.\n\n3. **LEFT to (\u22121, 7)**: \n   - This is out of bounds (not valid).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (1, 7)**: \n   - This cell contains the body of your snake.\n   - Hence, it's not a valid move.\n\n### Apple Review\nThe apple at (0, 2) requires navigating downwards into column 0, which requires effective moves down.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n- **UP to (0, 8)** allows a potential upward move but does not contribute toward reaching the apple at (0, 2).\n- **DOWN to (0, 6)** may be more promising as it keeps you in column 0, bringing you closer to descending directly to (0, 2) through more downward moves.\n\n### Strategic Consideration\nGiven the available moves and current position, moving **DOWN to (0, 6)** seems like the best option as it puts you closer to the coordinate path toward the apple at (0, 2).\n\n### Next Move Decision\nSince moving down keeps me vertical in a column moving toward my target apple, I decide to make my move:\n\n**DOWN** to (0, 6).\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nNext turn, I need to continue pushing downward to (0, 5) and then eventually to (0, 4), followed by (0, 3), leading to the target apple at (0, 2).\n\nSo, I will move: \n**DOWN**."
