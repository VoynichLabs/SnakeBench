Here's a breakdown of the possible moves:\n\n- **UP (to (1, 5))**: This move is valid. You are moving towards an apple.\n- **DOWN (to (1, 3))**: Not beneficial since it moves away from the apple.\n- **LEFT (to (0, 4))**: Moves left but there are no apples there and it takes you away from (1, 8).\n- **RIGHT (to (2, 4))**: While it's valid, it also does not get closer to any apples directly.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best move is to go UP to (1, 5), as it's the shortest path to the apple at (1, 8).\n\nI'm deciding to move UP."
