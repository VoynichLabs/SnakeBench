This is perfect positioning from my last move.\n\nAvailable apples are at:\n- (7, 2) - close to enemy snake\n- (8, 9) - far away in top right  \n- (2, 0) - bottom area\n- (0, 7) - directly above me, only 1 move needed!\n- (4, 6) - middle of board, same row as both snakes\n\nMy options from (0, 6):\n1. UP: Would move me to (0, 7) and collect the apple immediately! This gives me my first point and keeps me safely positioned.\n2. DOWN: Would move me to (0, 5), moving away from the apple\n3. LEFT: Would move me to (-1, 6) - this would hit the wall and kill me\n4. RIGHT: Would move me to (1, 6), moving toward the enemy snake and away from my target apple\n\nThe enemy snake is at (8, 6), which is the same row as me. We're 8 squares apart horizontally, so no immediate collision risk, but I should be aware they might also be targeting the apple at (4, 6) since it's in our shared row.\n\nMy strategy is working perfectly! I can grab this apple immediately and get my first point. After collecting it, I'll need to decide between going for the apple at (4, 6) in the center or the one at (2, 0) in the bottom area, depending on where the enemy snake moves.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting this apple and growing, assess enemy snake's movement pattern and target either (4, 6) for board control or (2, 0) for safety, depending on enemy positioning.\n\nUP"

My LEFT movement worked perfectly and I successfully collected the apple that was at (0, 3)! My snake has grown and I now have 1 point.\n\nCurrent situation analysis:\n- My head is at (0, 3) at the left wall\n- I just ate an apple and grew, so my body is longer now\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2, 9) with body at [(1, 9)] - still far away and not an immediate threat\n- Remaining apples: (2, 0), (0, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (8, 2)\n\nMovement options from (0, 3):\n1. LEFT: FORBIDDEN! This would hit the wall (x coordinate would go to -1)\n2. RIGHT: Move to (1, 3) - FORBIDDEN! This would hit my own body (my neck)\n3. DOWN: Move to (0, 2) - Safe, moves toward the bottom of the board\n4. UP: Move to (0, 4) - Safe, moves toward the apple cluster at row 8\n\nStrategic consideration:\nI need to decide between two main targets:\n1. The apple at (2, 0) - closer but isolated\n2. The apple cluster at (0, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8) - farther but multiple apples in one area\n\nSince I'm already at the left wall at (0, 3), and there's an apple directly above me at (0, 8), this seems like the most efficient path. Moving UP will start me on a direct path to (0, 8), and from there I can potentially collect the other nearby apples at (2, 8) and (3, 8).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2, 9) which is near that apple cluster, but they're still far enough away that I should be able to reach (0, 8) first if I move efficiently.\n\nStrategy for future turns: Continue moving UP along the left wall to reach the apple at (0, 8). After collecting that apple, assess the enemy snake's position and decide whether to go for the apples at (2, 8) and (3, 8) or retreat to a safer position.\n\nUP"
