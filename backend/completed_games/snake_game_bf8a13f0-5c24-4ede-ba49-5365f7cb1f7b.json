It keeps me away from the walls and gives me good positioning for future moves\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT, I should move DOWN toward the apple at (5, 6) to collect it quickly, then reassess the board state and plan my next target.\n\nLEFT"

From there, heading LEFT again would eventually reach the apple at (0, 9).\n- Alternatively, moving DOWN now from (9, 9) to (9, 8) seems less optimal as the snake just moved up.\n\nBut wait: current position is (9, 9). Moving LEFT to (8, 9) is safe, and in the next turn, we could move LEFT again to approach apples on the top row.\n\nSome considerations:\n- Our goal should be to prioritize reaching the closest or most accessible apples to grow and score.\n- The apple at (0, 9) is at the far left, possibly reachable via a sequence of LEFT moves from (9, 9), but it might take multiple steps.\n- The apple at (7, 2) is far below, which is less accessible at this point.\n- The apple at (1, 7) is to the left and near the top, possibly accessible if we move toward the top-left.\n\nGiven all this, the immediate safe move seems to be moving LEFT from (9, 9) to (8, 9). That keeps us on the top row, heading toward the apple at (0, 9), and is free of obstacles.\n\nNow, plan for the next move:\n- From (8, 9), moving LEFT to (7, 9) approaches the top row, leading closer to (0, 9).\n- Alternatively, moving DOWN from (9, 9) to (9, 8), then LEFT toward the apple at (0, 9) could also be an option, but it adds more steps.\n\nConclusion:\n- Moving LEFT from (9, 9) will move us closer to other apples along the top row and is safe.\n- Moving UP is not an option (we just ate the apple at (9, 9)).\n- Moving RIGHT is invalid.\n- Moving DOWN is safe but not optimal for immediate goals.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**\n\nNext, I plan to continue moving LEFT along the top row to approach the apple at (0, 9) efficiently and safely.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

This means we will likely eat this apple on the next move, increasing our score.\n- The apple at (9, 9) is directly above our current position; moving UP again from (9, 9) would result in hitting the boundary (since y=9 is the top edge). So moving UP again is not possible.\n- Our current position after the last move is (9, 9). We are on the apple, so the snake will grow.\n- Our next moves should aim toward other available apples while avoiding walls and enemies.\n- The remaining apples are at: (0, 9), (7, 2), (4, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7).\n\nGiven that, consider the following:\n\n- Moving RIGHT is out of bounds (x=10).\n- Moving DOWN from (9, 9) is valid to (9, 8), but that would take us away from the remaining apples. But since our snake just grew, moving down would be an opportunity to explore the lower parts towards apples at (7, 2), (4, 2), etc.\n- Moving LEFT from (9, 9) to (8, 9) seems safe; the cell is free of obstacles, and it brings us toward the apple at (0, 9) via moving left and then up, or directly pursuing the apple at (0, 9).\n- Moving LEFT now would bring us to (8, 9). From there, heading LEFT again would eventually reach the apple at (0, 9).\n- Alternatively, moving DOWN now from (9, 9) to (9, 8) seems less optimal as the snake just moved up.\n\nBut wait: current position is (9, 9). Moving LEFT to (8, 9) is safe, and in the next turn, we could move LEFT again to approach apples on the top row.\n\nSome considerations:\n- Our goal should be to prioritize reaching the closest or most accessible apples to grow and score.\n- The apple at (0, 9) is at the far left, possibly reachable via a sequence of LEFT moves from (9, 9), but it might take multiple steps.\n- The apple at (7, 2) is far below, which is less accessible at this point.\n- The apple at (1, 7) is to the left and near the top, possibly accessible if we move toward the top-left.\n\nGiven all this, the immediate safe move seems to be moving LEFT from (9, 9) to (8, 9). That keeps us on the top row, heading toward the apple at (0, 9), and is free of obstacles.\n\nNow, plan for the next move:\n- From (8, 9), moving LEFT to (7, 9) approaches the top row, leading closer to (0, 9).\n- Alternatively, moving DOWN from (9, 9) to (9, 8), then LEFT toward the apple at (0, 9) could also be an option, but it adds more steps.\n\nConclusion:\n- Moving LEFT from (9, 9) will move us closer to other apples along the top row and is safe.\n- Moving UP is not an option (we just ate the apple at (9, 9)).\n- Moving RIGHT is invalid.\n- Moving DOWN is safe but not optimal for immediate goals.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**\n\nNext, I plan to continue moving LEFT along the top row to approach the apple at (0, 9) efficiently and safely.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

But since our snake just grew, moving down would be an opportunity to explore the lower parts towards apples at (7, 2), (4, 2), etc.\n- Moving LEFT from (9, 9) to (8, 9) seems safe; the cell is free of obstacles, and it brings us toward the apple at (0, 9) via moving left and then up, or directly pursuing the apple at (0, 9).\n- Moving LEFT now would bring us to (8, 9). From there, heading LEFT again would eventually reach the apple at (0, 9).\n- Alternatively, moving DOWN now from (9, 9) to (9, 8) seems less optimal as the snake just moved up.\n\nBut wait: current position is (9, 9). Moving LEFT to (8, 9) is safe, and in the next turn, we could move LEFT again to approach apples on the top row.\n\nSome considerations:\n- Our goal should be to prioritize reaching the closest or most accessible apples to grow and score.\n- The apple at (0, 9) is at the far left, possibly reachable via a sequence of LEFT moves from (9, 9), but it might take multiple steps.\n- The apple at (7, 2) is far below, which is less accessible at this point.\n- The apple at (1, 7) is to the left and near the top, possibly accessible if we move toward the top-left.\n\nGiven all this, the immediate safe move seems to be moving LEFT from (9, 9) to (8, 9). That keeps us on the top row, heading toward the apple at (0, 9), and is free of obstacles.\n\nNow, plan for the next move:\n- From (8, 9), moving LEFT to (7, 9) approaches the top row, leading closer to (0, 9).\n- Alternatively, moving DOWN from (9, 9) to (9, 8), then LEFT toward the apple at (0, 9) could also be an option, but it adds more steps.\n\nConclusion:\n- Moving LEFT from (9, 9) will move us closer to other apples along the top row and is safe.\n- Moving UP is not an option (we just ate the apple at (9, 9)).\n- Moving RIGHT is invalid.\n- Moving DOWN is safe but not optimal for immediate goals.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**\n\nNext, I plan to continue moving LEFT along the top row to approach the apple at (0, 9) efficiently and safely.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

That keeps us on the top row, heading toward the apple at (0, 9), and is free of obstacles.\n\nNow, plan for the next move:\n- From (8, 9), moving LEFT to (7, 9) approaches the top row, leading closer to (0, 9).\n- Alternatively, moving DOWN from (9, 9) to (9, 8), then LEFT toward the apple at (0, 9) could also be an option, but it adds more steps.\n\nConclusion:\n- Moving LEFT from (9, 9) will move us closer to other apples along the top row and is safe.\n- Moving UP is not an option (we just ate the apple at (9, 9)).\n- Moving RIGHT is invalid.\n- Moving DOWN is safe but not optimal for immediate goals.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**\n\nNext, I plan to continue moving LEFT along the top row to approach the apple at (0, 9) efficiently and safely.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**"

My snake has length 5 total.\n\nCurrent apples available:\n- (0, 9) - top left corner, very far\n- (1, 5) - left side \n- (1, 7) - left side\n- (8, 8) - top right corner, directly above me vertically!\n- (0, 0) - bottom left corner\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (6, 3) with no body segments - it's positioned 2 spaces to my left on the same row.\n\nLet me check my movement options from (8, 3):\n- UP: Would take me to (8, 4) - safe, moves directly toward apple at (8, 8)\n- DOWN: Would take me to (8, 2) - safe, but moves away from apples\n- LEFT: Would take me to (7, 3) - that's where my body segment is! I'd hit myself.\n- RIGHT: Would take me to (9, 3) - safe, but moves toward the edge\n\nSince I can't go LEFT (would hit my own body), I have UP, DOWN, or RIGHT available.\n\nThe apple at (8, 8) is perfectly aligned with me vertically - I'm at (8, 3) and it's at (8, 8). This is an excellent opportunity! If I keep moving UP, I can reach it in 5 moves without any horizontal deviation needed.\n\nThe enemy snake at (6, 3) is on the same row but 2 spaces away, so it's not an immediate threat if I move UP.\n\nGoing UP to (8, 4) is clearly the best choice - it's safe, moves me directly toward the closest and most accessible apple, and keeps me away from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP toward the apple at (8, 8). After this move I'll be at (8, 4), then I can continue UP to (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), and finally (8, 8) to get the apple. Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position.\n\nUP"
