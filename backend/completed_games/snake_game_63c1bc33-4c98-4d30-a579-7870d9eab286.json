My body isn't a congestion to gain large enough space to use a smoother path to the left apple.\n\nConsidering my body will be placed at position 1 when I get the next point, to be at position 4, I'd rather have general space to the left. This suggests trying to move left first to clear the path going right later would put me in a more advantageous position.\n\nBefore continuing, I need to verify why moving up right now makes less sense than moving left. If we consider the initial assessment of needing to move left to allow me better path on right hit, clearly straight left would give more than straight right if just by the distance length has to grow (short now)",

Since I need to move left to gain a better path for future rightward movement, I should prioritize that. \n\nThe argument that moving left gives more space to the left and a shorter length of growth is true, which reduces the risk and potential congestion for future expansion. \n\nNow, considering my head position (1, 6) and the apple positions, I have a few options to focus on. The apples at (0, 4), (2, 6), (6, 9), and (1, 9) seem to be viable options for immediate movement, but considering my current position, moving left directly on the 0th column at (0, 6) is also a possibility. Given our example's apple distribution, targeting (0, 4) doesn't necessarily provide a clear, unaltered path going left because we cannot move outside of the left boundaries to try to hit anything short of a perpendicular intercept.\n\nHowever, (0, 6) seems a bit strange since it's vertical from the mid-point taking up the second highlighted apple at (2, 6), and (2, 6) isn't even viable anymore with my central axis put above my body ready for movement.\n\n0,6 brings us closer to avoiding any possible intercept with (2,6) even more safely than moving left directly on 0 as it wouldn't block the tried path looking away as we can go smoothly to 1 as waste putting us away from having unnecessary loss and competition\n\n\nHmmm...da\nThis REALLY makes me think though: Is (2,6) still not the leftmost apple they SURELY could possibly have?
