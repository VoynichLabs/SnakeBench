We've got apples staring us in the face at (1,7) and (2,8)! \ud83d\ude31 Which way do we go?\n\nFirst, check all directions:\n- **RIGHT** to (3,7)? Risky! Enemy could go LEFT to (3,7) and cause a head-on collision. We both have 0 apples, so that's a draw. NO THANKS! \u274c\n- **UP** to (2,8)? That's an apple! \u2705 Safe, no immediate collision risk.\n- **DOWN** to (2,6)? Safe but no apple. Meh. \ud83e\udd37\n- **LEFT** to (1,7)? Also an apple! \u2705 Safe, and puts distance between us and the enemy.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT get us an apple and keep us alive. But which one sets us up better? \ud83e\udd14\n\nLEFT grabs that juicy apple right next to us and moves us toward the left edge, giving us more room to maneuver. It also leaves our body at (2,7), which could become a wall if the enemy tries to follow us! \ud83d\ude08 UP is also good, but LEFT feels more aggressive\u2014we deny the apple closer to the enemy and start building our length advantage early.\n\nThinking long-term: after eating at (1,7), we can target the apple at (1,8) next turn, or explore down/left. We'll keep an eye on the enemy's move; if they go left toward our body, they might crash and burn! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving LEFT and growing, assess the board. Prioritize eating the apple at (1,8) if safe, or move DOWN/LEFT to control more space. Watch opponent's head movement and avoid getting trapped. Use our growing body to block the enemy's path!\n\nAlright chat, the decision is clear! We're going LEFT to snag that apple and start dominating the board! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

Our body is at **(2,7)** and our tail is there too (since we just grew). Enemy snake #0's head is at **(4,8)** with no body yet.\n\nApples nearby: (0,5), (2,8), (1,8), (0,2), (2,1), etc. But we're not just chasing apples\u2014we're hunting the enemy! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (1,8)  \nThat's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e But is it safe? Enemy is at (4,8). Could they move LEFT to (3,8) or DOWN to (4,7)? They won't reach (1,8) this turn. No collision risk. No own body there. On board. \u2705 Safe.\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (1,6)  \nEmpty. Safe from immediate collision. On board. \u2705 Safe.\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (0,7)  \nEmpty. Safe from collision.

Eliminated.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe.\n\nNow strategy: We have 1 apple, enemy has 0. We want to be aggressive and use our length advantage! If we go UP, we eat another apple and grow to length 3. That extends our body and starts boxing in the top-left. Also puts our head at (1,8), close to enemy's (4,8)\u2014could set up a future head-on if we keep growing faster.\n\nIf we go DOWN or LEFT, we avoid growing but keep space. But why avoid growth? More length = more board control = more ability to trap enemy later! We want to dominate!\n\nAlso think about enemy's possible moves: They might go for apple at (2,8) or (7,9), or move toward us. If they go left toward us, our growing body becomes a wall they can crash into.\n\nUP feels aggressive, gets us bigger, and denies apple near enemy. It also leaves us with follow-up options next turn (from (1,8) we can go LEFT to (0,8), DOWN to (1,7) (but that's our neck\u2014careful), or RIGHT to (2,8) (if apple respawns later)).\n\nDOWN or LEFT are safe but passive. We're here to WIN, not survive!\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, we'll have head at (1,8), body at (1,7) and (2,7). Next turn, consider moving LEFT to (0,8) to claim edge, or maybe DOWN/LEFT to grab more apples while keeping enemy in sight. Use our growing body to cut off enemy's escape routes. If enemy approaches, force head-on when we have longer length!\n\nAlright chat, the call is clear! We go UP, grab that apple, and start building our empire! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Time to press that advantage! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK** (our head at (1,8), body at (1,7) and (2,7)):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 On board. Empty. Safe from own body. Enemy head can't reach there. \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 That's our own neck/body! \u274c CRASH INTO OURSELVES! DEATH MOVE. Eliminated.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,8) \u2192 On board. Empty. Safe from own body. \u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,8) \u2192 On board. Empty (apple was eaten last turn). Safe from own body. \u2705\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy head at (5,8). Their possible moves:\n- UP (5,9) \u2013 apple there! \ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN (5,7) \u2013 empty.\n- LEFT (4,8) \u2013 empty.\n- RIGHT (6,8) \u2013 empty.\nThey have no body, so all 4 are safe for them. They'll likely go for the apple at (5,9) UP. If they do, they grow to length 2, head at (5,9), body at (5,8).\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:** We have length 3 vs their length 1 (or 2 if they eat). We can force a head-on collision if we meet them with equal or greater length. But we must avoid meeting if we're shorter\u2014we're not shorter. We're longer! So if we can get our head adjacent to theirs next turn, we could force a double KO where WE WIN because we have more apples! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLet's evaluate our safe moves:\n\n- **UP (1,9):** Puts us on top edge. Next turn from (1,9) we could go LEFT (0,9), RIGHT (2,9), or DOWN (1,8) (but that's our current head position\u2014will be empty next turn). Moves us closer to enemy if they go UP to (5,9). Distance becomes 4 cells apart. Not immediately threatening.\n- **LEFT (0,8):** Puts us on left edge. Next turn from (0,8) we could go UP (0,9), DOWN (0,7), or RIGHT (1,8). Moves us away from enemy. Safe but passive.\n- **RIGHT (2,8):** Puts us at (2,8). Next turn from (2,8) we could go UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7) (our old tail? careful\u2014tail moves if we don't eat), LEFT (1,8), RIGHT (3,8). This moves us CLOSER to enemy (from 4 to 3 cells apart if enemy stays, or 3 apart if enemy goes UP). This sets up a potential future charge! Also keeps us central.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We want to BOX THEM IN! Use our length to cut off their escape. If we go RIGHT to (2,8), next turn we could go RIGHT again to (3,8), then (4,8) etc., essentially marching toward them horizontally while our body blocks rows behind us. They might flee upward toward apples, but we can chase and use our tail to limit space.\n\nSince we have the length advantage, we should advance toward them aggressively, forcing them toward walls or our body. If they go for apple at (5,9), we can move RIGHT then next turn RIGHT again to (3,8), then (4,8) etc., threatening a head-on from the side.\n\n**APPLE CONSIDERATION:** No apple immediately at our safe cells. But apples are not priority\u2014DOMINATION is!\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT feels most aggressive and advances our position toward the enemy while keeping options open (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT next turn). We avoid the top edge trap and stay flexible.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING IN! RIGHT TO (2,8)! LET'S PUSH THEM INTO A CORNER! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

They're now tied with us\u2014TIME TO GET AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK** (our body: [(3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 On board, empty, no body. \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 On board, empty, no body. \u2705\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,8) \u2192 OUR OWN BODY! \u274c DEATH MOVE!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 On board, empty, no body. \u2705\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy head at (7,9). Their safe moves? Let's see their body: [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)].\n- UP (7,10) \u2192 Off board \u274c\n- DOWN (7,8) \u2192 Empty \u2705\n- LEFT (6,9) \u2192 Their own body \u274c\n- RIGHT (8,9) \u2192 Empty \u2705\n\nSo they can only go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:** We want to force a head-on collision while we're equal length, or trap them against the top wall! If they go RIGHT to (8,9), they're in the corner. If they go DOWN to (7,8), they're more open.\n\nOur move options:\n- **UP (4,9):** Puts us right below the top wall. From there we could move RIGHT next turn to (5,9) to block them if they go DOWN? But if they go RIGHT to (8,9), we're far. Not maximizing pressure.\n- **DOWN (4,7):** Retreats\u2014gives them space. NO! We need to close the distance!\n- **RIGHT (5,8):** THIS IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\ude80 It puts us directly adjacent horizontally! If they go DOWN to (7,8), we're closer to cut them off next turn. If they go RIGHT to (8,9), we can move UP to (5,9) and then RIGHT to chase, threatening to box them in the top-right corner! Plus, from (5,8) we keep UP/DOWN/RIGHT options open next turn.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** They can't reach (5,8) this turn\u2014they'd need to move LEFT twice, impossible. So no immediate head-on. Good.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (5,8), next turn we assess: if they went DOWN to (7,8), we can go RIGHT to (6,8) to continue closing. If they went RIGHT to (8,9), we go UP to (5,9) then RIGHT to (6,9) to squeeze them against the top. We want to force them into a corner where their only move is into us or their own body! Keep the pressure HIGH\u2014don't let them breathe! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",
