This is the nearest apple.\n- **Enemy snake #0 at (5,2)**: This snake is much closer to the (6,2) apple (only 1 cell away vs my 4 cells). Snake #0 will almost certainly get this apple first if they move toward it.\n- **Apple at (2,9)**: 7 cells away vertically. This is in my column and would be a good long-term target.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nThe enemy snake is very close to the (6,2) apple. If I move RIGHT toward it, I'll be competing directly with snake #0. At this early stage with no body segments, it's better to avoid direct conflict and find safer growth opportunities.\n\n**Best strategy:**\nContinue moving UP toward the (2,9) apple. This keeps me in a safe vertical column and avoids direct competition with snake #0. The path up the left side is relatively clear and gives me good long-term positioning.\n\n**Next turn plan:**\nContinue moving upward along the x=2 column toward (2,9), monitoring snake #0's movements to ensure I don't get trapped or collide with them unexpectedly.\n\nUP",

Collecting this apple will:\n1. Give me 1 apple (bringing me to 3 apples total)\n2. Grow my snake by 1 segment\n3. Keep me in a good position with multiple options\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8, 6) with 4 apples. It could potentially move toward the apple at (9, 5), but that's far from my position. The distance between us is significant (6 cells horizontally, 1 vertically), so there's no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Future planning:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (1, 5), I'll have my head at (1, 5) with a longer body. From there, I can consider:\n- Moving toward (0, 3) for another nearby apple\n- Moving UP toward (2, 9) for a longer-term goal\n- Exploring the left side of the board where there are fewer obstacles\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT is the optimal move - it directly collects an apple, grows my snake, and positions me well for future moves. This is clearly better than moving UP or RIGHT, which would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nLEFT",

Long-term flexibility:**  \nDOWN gives 4 safe follow-up directions, best for keeping options open.  \nRIGHT gets me closer to apple (9, 5) but reduces flexibility slightly (edge of board).  \nLEFT moves away from closest apple but keeps central position.\n\nGiven I have a lead (4 apples vs enemy\u2019s 2), I should prioritize safety and flexibility unless an apple is immediately available.  \nRIGHT now sets me up to eat apple (9, 5) next turn safely, since enemy can\u2019t reach it before me.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nIf RIGHT now \u2192 (9, 6), next turn go DOWN to (9, 5) for apple, then likely LEFT to (8, 5) to avoid being stuck on edge.  \nIf DOWN now \u2192 (8, 5), next turn can go RIGHT to (9, 5) for apple too, but that\u2019s same timing but from a more flexible position.\n\nActually, both RIGHT and DOWN get me to the apple in 2 moves, but RIGHT gets me adjacent to apple immediately next turn, reducing risk of enemy interfering (they\u2019re too far to get it in time).  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT puts me on track for apple with minimal risk.\n\nRIGHT",

Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (7, 1) \u2014 4 moves away.  \nFrom (9, 5), LEFT (8, 5) is slightly closer to (7, 1) than DOWN (9, 4) is.  \nAlso, apple (8, 1) is near (7, 1), so moving LEFT then DOWN might set up a path to both apples.\n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy snake #1 at (0, 5) is far away, not an immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term flexibility:**  \nBoth DOWN and LEFT give same immediate safe follow-ups.  \nLEFT moves me toward the cluster of apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which are reachable without obvious immediate danger.  \nStaying near the edge (DOWN) keeps me constrained; moving inward (LEFT) opens more board space.\n\n---\n\n**6. Risk assessment:**  \nNo immediate danger from enemy.  \nLEFT seems slightly better strategically because it progresses toward apples while maintaining options.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (8, 5), next turn I can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to approach apples at (7,1)/(8,1). Avoid doubling back into body segments.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples: (7, 1) and (8, 1) are 4\u20135 moves away.  \nFrom (6,5), DOWN or LEFT gets me closer to lower-left apples eventually, but UP goes away from them.  \nNo apple is immediately adjacent now (since I ate the one at (6,5) last turn).\n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy snake #1 at (1, 3) is far away, no immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term flexibility:**  \nAll three safe moves give 4 safe moves next turn.  \nI should move toward the cluster of apples at (7,1)/(8,1) \u2014 that means DOWN or LEFT.  \nLEFT (5,5) is slightly closer to those apples than staying at (6,5), but DOWN (6,4) is even closer in terms of Manhattan distance to apples at y=1.\n\nManhattan distances from possible next positions to (7,1):  \n- (6,6) \u2192 |6-7| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6  \n- (6,4) \u2192 |6-7| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4  \n- (5,5) \u2192 |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6  \n\nSo DOWN minimizes distance to nearest apple cluster.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter DOWN to (6,4), next turn I can go DOWN again toward y=1 to approach apples (7,1) and (8,1), avoiding my body which is mostly in upper rows now.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

I need to consider:\n1. Where are the reachable apples?\n2. Which direction gives me more future options?\n\n**Apple accessibility:**\n- (2, 9): Very far, need to navigate up\n- (8, 1): Far right, enemy snake is at (7, 1) so potentially dangerous\n- (9, 4): Far right and up\n- (4, 6): Up and slightly right\n- (5, 9): Far up and right\n\n**Future planning:**\nMoving LEFT to (2, 0) gives me access to:\n- Potential upward path via (2, 1), (2, 2) - but (2, 2) is already occupied by my body\n- Could potentially work my way up the left side of the board\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 0) gives me access to:\n- Open space in the bottom right quadrant\n- Could potentially head toward (4, 6) or continue right toward (8, 1) and (9, 4)\n- More maneuvering room\n\n**Risk assessment:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7, 1), so moving RIGHT toward (4, 0) and then potentially further right keeps me at a safe distance of at least 3 units horizontally from the enemy.\n\nLEFT would take me to (2, 0), which actually moves me slightly closer to my own body constraints but doesn't immediately trap me.\n\n**Optimal move:**\nRIGHT to (4, 0) gives me:\n1. More open space to maneuver\n2. Better positioning to access multiple apples\n3. Safe distance from enemy snake #0\n4. Better long-term positioning for the apples at (4, 6) and potentially (8, 1), (9, 4)\n\n**Short-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (4, 0), I should consider heading UP toward (4, 1) to start working my way toward the apple at (4, 6). This will give me more space to grow and avoid getting trapped in the bottom-left corner with my own body.\n\nRIGHT",

I successfully collected the apple at (1, 8) last turn and now have 8 apples. Looking at the remaining apples, there's a cluster of four apples along the top row: (2, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), and (7, 9). The closest one is (2, 9), which is just one move away if I go RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (6, 8), also positioned to compete for the apples on the top row, particularly (6, 9) and (7, 9). However, I'm closer to (2, 9) and (5, 9) than the enemy is.\n\n**Move evaluation:**\n- UP to (1, 9): Gets me to the top row, then I can move RIGHT to (2, 9) to collect that apple next turn\n- LEFT to (0, 8): Moves away from all the apples\n- RIGHT to (2, 8): Positions me to go UP to (2, 9) next turn\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, UP is slightly better because it gets me to the top row immediately, and from (1, 9) I can collect (2, 9) next turn. Both moves keep me safely away from the enemy snake.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter reaching the top row at (1, 9), I'll collect (2, 9), then continue along the top row toward (5, 9), (6, 9), and (7, 9). I need to be cautious about the enemy snake at (6, 8) - they'll likely be competing for (6, 9) and (7, 9). I should try to collect (2, 9) and (5, 9) first, then assess whether I can safely get (6, 9) or if I should retreat and look for other opportunities like the apple at (7, 0).\n\nUP",

Actually: my current body is 12 long (apples = 12). So length = 12 segments. After moving without eating apple, length stays 12, tail moves forward one, head moves to (5, 6). Let\u2019s simulate: current body:  \n1: (5, 8)  \n2: (5, 9)  \n3: (6, 9)  \n4: (6, 8)  \n5: (7, 8)  \n6: (8, 8)  \n7: (8, 7)  \n8: (8, 6)  \n9: (8, 5)  \n10: (8, 4)  \n11: (9, 4)  \n12: (9, 3)  <-- tail  \n\nAfter moving: new head = (5, 6), remove tail (9, 3), so body becomes:  \n[(5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (9, 4)]  \n\nFrom (5, 6) possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 7) \u2192 my body? Check: Body list has (5, 8), (5, 9), etc. Not (5, 7)? Correct, empty. Wait no: The old head (5, 7) is gone. New body: first segment is (5, 6), next segment is (5, 8) \u2014 so (5, 7) is empty? No, (5, 7) is not in body. Wait, did I mess up? Current turn head is (5, 7). We\u2019re moving from (5, 7) to (5, 6). The previous head becomes the neck: so after moving, body = [ (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), ... up to (9, 4) ] yes! tail (9, 3) gone.  \n\nSo from (5, 6) next turns: UP \u2192 (5, 7) is in body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe!  \nDOWN \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 empty  \nLEFT \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 look at body segments: enemy\u2019s body possibly? Wait, enemy #1 body given: (4, 6) is in enemy body (last segment). So LEFT \u2192 (4, 6) into enemy body \u2192 DEATH.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo after DOWN, only 1 safe move next turn: RIGHT \u2192 (6, 6). That\u2019s risky (only 1 option).  \n\n---\n\n**LEFT to (4, 7):**  \nBody after move: [ (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4) ] \u2014 tail was (9, 3), now (9, 4) gone? Wait check length: 12 total: body before move: count=12. Moving: add (4, 7) head, remove tail (9, 3): so body afterwards:  \nHead (4, 7) + old head (5, 7) + rest up to segment before tail: let\u2019s list from current: segments:  \n0: (5, 7)  \n1: (5, 8)  \n2: (5, 9)  \n3: (6, 9)  \n4: (6, 8)  \n5: (7, 8)  \n6: (8, 8)  \n7: (8, 7)  \n8: (8, 6)  \n9: (8, 5)  \n10: (8, 4)  \n11: (9, 4)  <-- tail before move? Wait, given body list: last tuple is (9, 3) as tail. Let\u2019s check: body given: [(5, 8), ..., (9, 3)] that\u2019s 12 segments including head? No, head is separate: the provided body list is from neck to tail: length 12 means head + 12 segments total length 13? Or length=apples+initial? Wait, apples=12 means the snake length = apples+1 (initial head)?? Let\u2019s verify: Initially length 1, each apple increases length by 1. So length = 1 + apples_collected = 13. But list body given has 12 coords. That\u2019s correct: head + 12 body segments = 13 total length.  \n\nSo after moving: new head (4, 7), add old head (5, 7) as neck, keep body list except drop tail (9, 3).  \n\nFrom (4, 7) next moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 8) \u2192 empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 enemy body segment (4, 6) \u2192 death  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7) \u2192 my body segment (old head) \u2192 death  \n\nSo only UP and LEFT safe next turn \u2192 2 options.  \n\n---\n\n**RIGHT to (6, 7):**  \nBody after move: head (6, 7), old head (5, 7) as neck, then rest minus tail (9, 3).  \n\nFrom (6, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 8) \u2192 my body (segment from earlier) \u2192 dead  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 6) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 7) \u2192 my body \u2192 dead  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 7) \u2192 empty  \n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn \u2192 2 options.  \n\n---\n\n**Comparing:**  \n- DOWN \u2192 only 1 safe move next turn (trapped) \u2014 avoid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 2 safe moves; takes me closer to apple (3, 4) and enemy head at (4, 9) possible path.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 2 safe moves; takes me away from enemy, toward right side board, possible path to apple (7, 0) long term.  \n\nBetter to avoid risk with enemy: RIGHT seems safer, more space, enemy at top left.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Prefer RIGHT to keep distance from enemy and maintain options, then gradually aim for apple (7, 0) or (5, 1). Avoid approaching enemy until necessary.  \n\nRIGHT",
