Moving UP will allow us to immediately eat it, grow, and increase our points.\n- Moving UP is the shortest, most direct route to the apple.\n- Adjacent cells in other directions:\n  - RIGHT to (4,7): empty, but less direct.\n  - LEFT to (2,7): empty, but less direct.\n  - DOWN to (3,6): risky because it retraces our previous movement and might trap us or lead to dead-ends in future turns.\n- No obstacles or threats in the immediate vicinity:\n  - Enemy snake at (7,6) is far away.\n  - No walls nearby; the cell (3,8) is within the board.\n- Since the move is safe, straightforward, and gives us immediate points, it makes sense to move UP.\n\nNext turn, I will plan to:\n\n- Continue pursuing apples efficiently.\n- Avoid turning back on ourselves.\n- Keep an eye on potential blockage or enemy moves.\n\nTherefore, my decision for the next move is:\n\n**UP**"
