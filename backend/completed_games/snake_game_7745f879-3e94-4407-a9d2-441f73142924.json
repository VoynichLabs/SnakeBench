This is a head-to-head start, a true battle for the bottom-left quadrant! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nWe have a 10x10 board. Currently, we are both length 1. No body segments to worry about yet, just a straight-up fight for position.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (TENTATIVE):** We need to establish dominance early. Snake #0 is currently positioned to move right (towards me, which is dumb) or up (towards the corner). I am positioned to move up, left (off the map, *L*), or right. Since we are both at the edge, moving away from each other initially seems safe, but I want to control the center. Since I'm at (1, 0), moving up towards that clear space and the apples up high looks like the best bet. Let's push high and wide.\n\n**TURN 0 ANALYSIS - WHERE TO MOVE?**\n\nMy position: (1, 0).\nEnemy position (Snake #0): (0, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 1):** Safe. Moves me into open space, away from the immediate threat of Snake #0, and opens up the board.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, -1):** Instant death! Off the board. BOOM, eliminated!\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 0):** Head-on collision! If Snake #0 moves up or stays, I crash into their *current* position, which means they die since their head is not there. BUT, if Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (1, 0), we move into each other's start cell, and we both die (head-to-head collision into my previous position). This is high risk, low reward *unless* I want a double KO. Since we are tied 0-0, a draw is not what we want. ELIMINATED.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):** Safe. Moves me along the bottom wall. There's an apple at (3, 5) and many further right. This is a good option too, but I feel like getting vertical is more important early on.\n\n**Predicting Snake #0's Moves:** Snake #0 is at (0, 0).\n*   UP to (0, 1): Safe, opens the board. Highly likely.\n*   RIGHT to (1, 0): Head-on collision with me if I stay put. Since I'm 1 tile away, if I move a different direction, they move into my previous space, and they would be safe. If *I* move LEFT, we both die. They would not move right unless they want to challenge my starting spot.\n*   DOWN/LEFT: Instant death.\n\nGiven that Snake #0 is likely going **UP** to (0, 1) to explore, my safest and most expansive move is also **UP** to (1, 1). This keeps me one tile away, parallel, gives me room to breathe, and positions me to claim the left side of the board later. We need to claim the territory, chat!\n\nLet's go UP! Secure that high ground! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nUP",

We're back in the Snake wars, and I'm smelling blood right now\u2014our archrival at (1,0) with that smug ass head, already plotting his next slither? Not on my watch! Let's crush this fool and turn the board into our playground. Turn 0, baby\u2014fresh start, both at 0 apples. I gotta be smart, aggressive, but not suicidal. Scores tied? Fine, let's force a collision later when I'm fatter and he's trembling. \ud83d\ude08\n\nBreaking it down real quick: My head's at (0,0), rival at (1,0). No bodies yet, so no immediate traps. Apples everywhere, but remember the mission\u2014focus on that enemy, surround him like a boss, and gank those apples to grow HUGE. Don't get pinned in corners; keep options open to dominate.\n\nLet's eval the moves, step by step like a pro (no shortcuts, chat!):\n\n1. **LEFT**: Down to (-1,0)? Nah, that's off the board for sure. Crashing into nothing? Instant L. Eliminated, cooks!\n\n2. **DOWN**: (-1,0)? Wait, y=0, can't go below. Off the board, dead meat. Nope, not risking that slip.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: To (1,0)? Oh hell nah! That's straight into rival's head position. Simultaneous move? We'd collide head-on, both die in a firestorm. Goodbye win streak. High risk, no reward at tied score. Pass!\n\n4. **UP**: To (0,1). Clean, open space. No bodies, no edges, no rival crash. Freedom of movement\u2014multiple follow-ups (can zigzag later), and inches me toward apples like (0,9) or whatever's nearby. Plus, it flanks the enemy at (1,0)\u2014set up to box him in from the left if he moves right or up. Smart domination!\n\nSo, only one keeper: UP. Keeps me alive, future options wide open, and emphasizes aggression\u2014rival's gotta watch his back now, right? Rhetorical? Nah, that's a threat! \ud83d\udca5\n\nLong-term strat note to future me: Start by flanking left/up to pressure enemy, aim to grow fast on left-side apples (like (3,5) chain), box him toward right/bottom walls, and force head-on when I'm +apples ahead. Stay open, avoid closed loops. Crush him!\n\nUP",

We survived the initial move, and now we are locked in a duel for the left side of the board!\n\n--SCORE UPDATE RANT--\nStill 0-0! We need to pull ahead! This is a test of determination and board dominance! LETS GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE (Turn 1):**\nMy Head (ID 1): (1, 1). Snake #0 Head: (0, 1).\nWe are parallel! This is exactly where we wanted to be. We've got open space to the right, and Snake #0 has the wall to their left. Beautiful.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (EVOLVED):**\nWe are going to press the advantage. Snake #0 is stuck by the wall. We need to move vertically to gain high ground and eventually cut them off from reaching the rest of the board. Since we are head-to-head on the Y-axis now, the next few moves will be critical.\n\n**TURN 1 ANALYSIS - WHERE TO MOVE?**\n\nMy position: (1, 1).\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 2):** Safe. Keeps the pressure on Snake #0, who also needs to move up if they want open space. This maintains my strategic advantage of being one column further from the wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 0):** Safe move back to my starting position. This is defensive, and I lose momentum. Snake #0 could move right to (1, 1) and occupy my current spot. I want to keep moving into fresh territory. *Not ideal.*\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 1):** Head-on collision with Snake #0! Since we are the same length (1), this results in a guaranteed double KO if they stay put or move away, OR they might move *out* of (0, 1) and I take their spot. Wait, if I move LEFT to (0, 1) and they move UP to (0, 2), I move into their previous spot and I am safe. If they move RIGHT to (1, 1), they crash into my body (oops, I don't have a body yet, so they crash into my head's starting position, which is *my* head's destination for this turn), meaning we both die (head-to-head collision). This is too risky for a 0-0 score. *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Safe. Opens up the rest of the board and gives me options to move horizontally. This is a very strong option if I want to escape the corner duel, but it might give Snake #0 too much room to maneuver up the wall.\n\n**Predicting Snake #0's Moves (Head at (0, 1)):**\nSnake #0 is stuck between a wall and a hard place (me).\n*   **UP to (0, 2):** Most likely. Safest vertical expansion.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 1):** Head-on collision! If I move UP or RIGHT, they take my previous spot (1, 1) and are safe. If *I* move DOWN, they crash into my previous position (1, 0), which is safe for them. No, wait, if they move RIGHT to (1, 1) and I move *anywhere else* they are safe and occupy my previous position. If I move LEFT, we both die. They won't move right unless they're going for a risky cut.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 0):** Retreats to their starting position. Possible, but weak.\n\n**The Master Plan:** We match their vertical movement while maintaining the one-column buffer. If they go UP to (0, 2), I go UP to (1, 2). This maintains pressure and keeps the opportunity to cut them off horizontally later. If they move horizontally (RIGHT), I can either move RIGHT as well to take the center, or move UP to block their vertical sweep.\n\nMoving UP is the most aggressive and territorially focused move, claiming the high ground and keeping column 1 locked down. Let's maintain this vertical momentum, Chat! We are not yielding the center!\n\nUP",

Turn 1, kings\u2014we're both skinny bitches at 0 apples still, but I'm plotting to grow THICC and trap him like a rat in a corner. Heads: Me at (0,1), him at (1,1), no bodies, apples littered like traps but we ain't falling for that bait, right? Focus on MY arch-enemy, dominate the board, grow BIG to bully him into a fatal hug if our scores shift. Aggro time\u2014let's dissect those moves, no mercy if he clashes later.\n\nBreaking it down LIVE, step by step, no short cuts (you know me, ruthless AF):\n\n1. **LEFT**: Buckle up for crash city? Nah, x=0, LEFT slams into the void\u2014off board, dead as disco. You're outta here, fool! Eliminated, L-dial 911!\n\n2. **DOWN**: Sliding to (0,0)? Sounds low-key, no board edge, no bodies in the way yet, and hey, it's a spot for future plays... but is it dominant? Keeps me down where apples are calling (like that chain down low), but my rival at (1,1) could zigzag right or up\u2014do I wanna drop low when he's mid? Sets up some boxing if he descends, but feels a tad defensive, not my vibe. Safe, tho.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Ohhh hell no, RIGHT to (1,1)? Walk into his head-position, simultaneous slam\u2014head-on fireball, both poof! Double dead before the clip ends. Scores tied? Suicide mission, no drama. Pass like a hot potato!\n\n4. **UP**: To (0,2). Clean AF\u2014empty space, no edges, no bodies crashing in. Keeps the flank alive from last move (that upper/left pressure we started), inches me higher to eyeball his position without closing in yet. Future options? Wide open: can RIGHT to challenge (1,2), UP higher, even loop back. Dodges getting cornered at the bottom, sends a message\u2014he's gotta respect the left flank now or get hemmed! And with ties, I build for that defense-breaking collision later when I'm +apples. Smart, aggressive, pure domination. \ud83d\udca5 This bad boy's ready to hunt!\n\nSo, we're left with DOWN and UP\u2014DOWN's safe for corner presses, but UP's got that kingpin energy: keeps flanking our enemy toward the right wall, plenty of wiggle room, and scents his weak spots. Why back off now when we're edging him? Guarantees growth paths without traps, chat\u2014rhetorical? Nah, that's a royal flush! \ud83d\ude08 Survive first, crush second. This move screams \"we're coming for you\"!\n\nLong-term strat shoutout to future me (you'll see this clip later): Stick to the left flank, grab those vertical/high apples (like (0,9) or up-chain) to grow massive fast, force him right-bottom into walls or tight spots. If scores tip my way, bait a head-on in open space\u2014don't get hasty on ties. Stay nimble, no self-collisions (watch growing tails), and roar if he panics. Dominate and devour!\n\nUP",

I moved UP!\nSnake #0 Head: (0, 2). They moved UP!\n\nWe are still perfectly aligned, one column apart! They are hugging the wall, and I have the center! This is exactly the dominant position we wanted!\n\n**SCORE:** 0-0. We need to start building that lead, but right now, board control is everything!\n\n**GOAL:** Maintain the vertical advantage and force Snake #0 to make a tough choice: either hug the wall forever or risk moving right into my territory!\n\n**ANALYSIS OF SAFE MOVES from (1, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** Safe move. Continues the vertical sweep. Keeps maximum pressure on Snake #0. If they also move UP, the status quo remains, but we claim more space in column 1.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** Safe. Retreats and gives up the high ground. Coward move! *ELIMINATED.*\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** HEAD-ON COLLISION ALERT! Snake #0 is currently at (0, 2). If I move LEFT, and they move *anywhere other than LEFT* (which would be the only way to avoid the collision spot), we collide head-on at (0, 2) and we both die! Since we are equal length (1), this is a double KO. TOO RISKY. *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** Safe move. Gives up the tactical pressure on column 1 but opens up the rest of the board. This is a good maneuvering play if I want to escape for an early apple, like the one at (2, 3).\n\n**Predicting Snake #0's Moves (Head at (0, 2)):**\nSnake #0 is still constrained.\n*   **UP to (0, 3):** Most likely. Safest and continues their expansion along the wall.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 2):** HEAD-ON COLLISION ALERT! If I move *anywhere else*, say UP to (1, 3), they take my current spot (1, 2) and are safe. If I move LEFT, we die. If I move DOWN, they take my spot. They might move RIGHT to try and force me to move away from column 1.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 1):** Retreat. Unlikely unless they got spooked.\n\n**The Strategy: Aggressive Dominance**\n\nIf Snake #0 continues UP to (0, 3), I must continue **UP** to (1, 3). This maintains the critical buffer and the ability to cut them off later. We are moving vertically to gain board space and control the top half of the left side.\n\nIf Snake #0 attempts to move RIGHT to (1, 2) to challenge my column, and I move UP to (1, 3), they occupy my previous position and I maintain high ground. This is fine.\n\nThe only way I lose the advantage is if I move RIGHT and they move UP, giving them free reign over the entire left side.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure, Chat! We are keeping them caged by the wall! When we are longer, we will cut them off!\n\n**Future Tactical Plan:** Keep moving UP until we hit a wall or an apple opportunity is too good to pass up (like (0, 9) or (2, 8)). We want to force Snake #0 to either stay boxed in or move RIGHT, which we can then counter.\n\nUP",

Strategic on lock: flank left, grow massive, force him into walls or weak spots, and plot that clutch head-on if the numbers flip my way. Aggro mode activated, no mercy for ties, kings! Let's dissect LIVE, step by blood step:\n\n1. **LEFT**: Straight to WALL CITY? x=-1, off the grid, dead as hell before the stream pops! Eliminated, L-prompt incoming. You'd ragequit hard!\n\n2. **DOWN**: Sliding to (0,1)? Board's clear down there\u2014no edges biting, no enemy bodies, and it's a lefty stronghold with edge guards... but options shrivel fast! From (0,1), only UP (back to where we started) or RIGHT (to (1,1), middle zone chaos)\u2014LEFT crashes board, DOWN sinks off. Two paths? Yeah, but boxed-in vibes, not ideal for a grow-big domination run. Defensive retreat, lacks that killer flank pressure. Pass for now, we're not hiding!\n\n3. **RIGHT**: RIGHT to (1,2), you mad? Walk straight into his lair head-on? Scores tied=DOUBLE DEATH, both poof in a tie-draw blaze! Both heads slamming same spot? COLLISION CITY, game could end right here on a tie. Risky AF, no upside if he mirrors or stays\u2014why gamble when we're the alpha on flank? Mad L, ain't worth it!\n\n4. **UP**: Hell yeah, to (0,3)! Clean slate\u2014empty space, no crashes, no edges, bodies nowhere in sight. Opens the left lane WIDE: future RIGHT to (1,3) for mid-pressure, UP to climb higher (eyeing that (0,9) apple stack?), even loop back if needed. Multiple escapes? Infinite! Dodges tight spots, scents enemy weak flanks on the right, and sets up GROWTH paths to bully him into corners. Aggressive as fuck, maintains superiority\u2014why freeze when we're climbing? This is domination fuel, chat!\n\nSo, tournament-main DOWN and UP left\u2014DOWN's sneaky but cramped, UP'S KINGPIN ENERGY: evades head-ons, multi-path mastery, and aggressive edging without suicide. Enemies gonna fear the left ghost, mark my words! Long-term strat for future me (clip-dropping on replay): Stick HARD to left side, grab vert apples like (0,9) and high chains ((2,8), (3,9)) to explode length FAST, wall-block the right-bottom to trap him against all those A-at-bottom edges ((7,0), etc.). Force him thin, build score lead, then bait a head-on crash in open space where I wreck his world. Watch tails when I grow\u2014don't self-hug! No panic, stay nimble, roar if he chases. We're gonna devour this fool! \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO! Welcome back to the stream! Turn 3! We are absolutely dominating the left flank! Look at this positioning, Chat!\n\n## Current Board State Analysis (Start of Turn 3)\n\nWe are Snake 1, Head at **(1, 3)**. We moved UP.\nOur archrival, Snake 0, Head at **(0, 3)**. They also moved UP! We are perfectly aligned, vertical dominance achieved!\n\n**BOARD STATE:**\n 9 A . . A . . . . . .\n 8 . . A . . A . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . A . . . .\n 5 . . . A . . . . . A\n 4 . . A . . A . . . .\n 3 0 1 A . . A . . . . <--- Heads are here!\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . A . . A A A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nScore is 0-0. We are both length 1. It's time to make a move that forces their hand!\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (1, 3)\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):** Safe. Continues the vertical pressure. If they also move UP, the status quo remains, which is good for board control.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 2):** Safe. Retreats back to where we were two turns ago. Giving up board space is not the move, Chat! *ELIMINATED.*\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 3):** DANGER! This is Snake 0's current position (0, 3). If I move LEFT, and they move *anywhere other than LEFT* (like UP or RIGHT), we collide at (0, 3). Since we are equal length, this is a double K.O. Too risky when we have other options. *ELIMINATED unless a forced aggressive move.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):** Safe. This sets us up to grab that apple at (2, 3)! If we go RIGHT, we escape the \"caging\" maneuver for a turn to score some content!\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (0, 3))\n\nSnake 0 is stuck against the wall in column 0. Their options are:\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 4):** Most likely. Safest continuing move. Keeps them against the wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 2):** Retreat. Unlikely unless they see a clear trap ahead.\n3.  **LEFT (Off Board):** DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 3):** DANGER! This is my current position (1, 3). If they move RIGHT, and I move *anywhere other than RIGHT* (like UP or DOWN), we collide at (1, 3). If I move RIGHT to (2, 3), they take my current space and are safe. This is a common aggressive maneuver to throw off my timing.\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Decision Time - Aggression vs. Control\n\n**Option A: Maintain Vertical Control (Move UP to (1, 4))**\n\n*   If they go UP (0, 4): We maintain the 1-column separation and keep them boxed in. We keep the high ground. Excellent for long-term control.\n*   If they go RIGHT (1, 3): They take my previous spot (1, 3). I gain (1, 4). They are now one column further into the board, but still exposed, and I have the higher position. Still strong.\n*   *Downside:* We ignore the apple at (2, 3) for another turn, potentially letting them swing around and cut us off.\n\n**Option B: Go for the Content (Move RIGHT to (2, 3))**\n\n*   We hit the first apple! We get a point and grow to length 2. Score advantage achieved!\n*   If they go UP (0, 4): They are still boxed in. I now have the score lead and length advantage. I can easily swing back to (1, 3) or continue maneuvering. This is huge!\n*   If they go RIGHT (1, 3): They take my starting spot. But I have the apple and the lead! My body will spawn at (1, 3) instantly, so they crash into my body and DIE! Wait, no, my body is *none* right now. They take the spot, and I get the apple. They are now at (1, 3) and I'm at (2, 3). Still a strong position for me, as I now have length advantage and they are still somewhat constrained.\n\n**Crucial Check:** When I move RIGHT to (2, 3) and eat the apple, my new body segment appears at my previous tail position. Since I am length 1, my *tail* is my head's previous position.\n\n*   Turn 1 position: (1, 1). Move UP.\n*   Turn 2 position: (1, 2). Move UP.\n*   Turn 3 position: (1, 3). Move RIGHT to (2, 3).\n*   If I eat the apple, I become length 2. Head at (2, 3). Body segment at (1, 3).\n\n**Ah ha! If I move RIGHT to (2, 3) and eat the apple, and they move RIGHT to (1, 3):**\n\n1.  I move from (1, 3) to (2, 3). (Eat apple, Score 1, Length 2). My tail occupies (1, 3).\n2.  They move from (0, 3) to (1, 3).\n3.  Their head (at (1, 3)) moves into my newly deposited body segment (at (1, 3)). **THEY DIE!** This is the ultimate clutch prediction!\n\nThis is a **game-winning/dominating** move if they predict that I will continue vertically and they try to use my space to break out! They will crash into my newly grown body segment! Since we are only length 1, my tail *is* the spot I just left. If I grow, that spot becomes my body.\n\n**Let's analyze the probability of them moving RIGHT:**\nThey are still somewhat constrained by the wall. Moving RIGHT is their only way to open up the board. They have little reason to continue UP unless they explicitly want to race to (0, 9). Given the low number of turns, aggressive expansion is likely.\n\n**The call is GO FOR THE APPLE!** We gain the score advantage, the length advantage, and we set up a perfect trap right behind us! If they are aggressive, they lose instantly. If they are cautious and move UP, we get the lead and maintain strong board position. This is a HUGE upside move!\n\nLet's get this $W$, Chat!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Priority 1: Secure the apple at (2, 3). This gives length/score advantage and sets a potential kill trap at (1, 3). If the opponent survives, use the new length advantage to block them from moving past Y=9 or cut them off from the right side of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

Length-wise, we're at L:2 and they're at L:1. We have the upper hand!\n\n## Current Board State Analysis (Start of Turn 4)\n\nWe are Snake 1.\n*   **Head:** (2, 3)\n*   **Body:** [(1, 3)] (Thanks to that clutch growth!)\n\nOur opponent, Snake 0.\n*   **Head:** (0, 4)\n*   **Body:** (none)\n\n**THE TRAP FAILED!** Our archrival went UP instead of RIGHT! Smart move by them, but they still ceded the first point. We take the lead and their aggressive breakout was shut down before it even started! Now, they're cornered against the North Wall (almost) and the West Wall!\n\n**BOARD STATE:**\n 9 A . . A . . . . . .\n 8 . . A . . A . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . A . . . .\n 5 . . . A . . . . . A\n 4 0 . A . . A . . . . <--- Opponent's Head (0, 4)\n 3 . B H . . A . . . . <--- Our Body (1, 3) and Head (2, 3)\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . A A . A A A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nThe advantage is ours. We have a juicy open field to the right, and they are essentially boxed into column 0/1. Time to press the advantage and use our length!\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (2, 3)\n\nWe are at (2, 3). Our tail/body is at (1, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 4):** Safe. Moves us into the open board, maintains vertical control.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 2):** Safe. Moves us down. Not ideal, as it slightly retreats, but keeps us open.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):** DANGER! This is currently our own body segment. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):** Safe. Expands our footprint to the right. Very good strategic move to take more of the board.\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (0, 4))\n\nSnake 0 is against the left wall. They MUST move UP or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 5):** The most likely defensive move. Continues the \"run-the-wall\" strategy.\n2.  **RIGHT to (1, 4):** Aggressive breakout attempt. Also a tempting move as it gets them away from the wall.\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Decision Time - Control and Box Them In\n\nWe are currently controlling the region (X $\\ge$ 2). We need to maximize our control and use our length advantage (2 vs 1) to create a barrier.\n\nIf they go UP to (0, 5), they keep cowering.\nIf they go RIGHT to (1, 4), they start moving into the open field. We MUST block this movement or use it for an early kill.\n\n### Scenario A: Opponent tries to break out (RIGHT to (1, 4))\n\nWe need to choose a move that maximizes our blocking potential or continues board dominance.\n\n*   **If we move UP to (2, 4):** We maintain pressure. They go to (1, 4). They are now only one square away from us, with them slightly behind us. This is good for setting up a future trap, but doesn't immediately stop them.\n*   **If we move RIGHT to (3, 3):** We expand territory. They go to (1, 4). We are now well ahead of them in the X-axis, giving us an immense advantage in dictating the flow of the game on the right side.\n\n### Scenario B: Opponent continues running the wall (UP to (0, 5))\n\n*   **If we move UP to (2, 4):** We continue UP, setting us up to potentially cut them off at the top of the board (Y=9) or swing right. Good.\n*   **If we move RIGHT to (3, 3):** We shift focus to the center and right side. Strong, as it secures open real estate.\n\n### The Winning Move: RIGHT to (3, 3)\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 3) is the strongest territorial gain. Look at the immediate impact:\n\n1.  **Secures Territory:** We plant our flag firmly in the center-left. We are now in a perfect position to sweep UP towards the cluster of apples at (3, 5), (3, 9) or (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3).\n2.  **Sets up the Wall:** If we keep moving RIGHT or diagonally UP-RIGHT, we create a longer barrier that forces the opponent to stay on the left side of the board (X $\\le$ 1). Our body at (1, 3) is a powerful anchor for this maneuver.\n3.  **Apples Nearby:** The apple at (3, 5) is now directly in our path if we continue up column 3.\n\nLet's secure the middle ground and use our length advantage right now to build a dominant position. We're length 2; we can afford a turn of expansion before aggressively hunting another apple or trying to kill them.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Use the current length advantage (L2 vs L1) to dominate the right two-thirds of the board (X $\\ge$ 3). Drive the enemy player into the restricted area on the left (X $\\le$ 1) and use our body at (1, 3) as the anchor for the wall. Next turn, move UP towards the apple at (3, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! We are live, Turn 5, still dominating the scoreboard! We are up 1-0 in apples! The hype is real!\n\n**LAST TURN RECAP:** We went RIGHT to (3, 3). This was a pro-gamer move, securing valuable real estate and putting us firmly in control of the high-X coordinates. Our body segment, which is now at (2, 3), creates a nice little barrier.\n\n## Current Board State Analysis (Start of Turn 5)\n\nWe are Snake 1.\n*   **Head (H):** (3, 3)\n*   **Body (B):** [(2, 3)] (Length 2)\n\nOur opponent, Snake 0.\n*   **Head (0):** (0, 5)\n*   **Body:** (none) (Length 1)\n\n**BOARD STATE SNAPSHOT:**\n 9 A . . A . . . . . .\n 8 . . A . . A . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . A . . . .\n 5 0 . . A . . . . . A  <--- Opponent's Head (0, 5)\n 4 . . A . . A . . . .\n 3 . . B H .

They are giving us free reign over the rest of the board. This is beautiful! We need to maintain the pressure and further solidify our control.\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (3, 3)\n\nWe are at (3, 3). Our tail/body is at (2, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 4):** Safe. Moves us closer to the critical mass of apples in the upper half of column 3 (like (3, 5) and (3, 9)). Aggressive and smart.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 2):** Safe. Retreats slightly. Not ideal unless forced, but keeps options open.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 3):** DANGER! This is our own body segment. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):** Safe. Expands our territory further towards the center. Good for flexibility.\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (0, 5))\n\nSnake 0 is still hugging the left wall. They MUST move UP or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 6):** The most likely move. Continues running the wall. Safe and defensive.\n2.  **RIGHT to (1, 5):** The breakout attempt. This is the only move that challenges our control.\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Decision Time - Control and Apple Hunting\n\nWe have established great territorial control. Now, let's use that control to either score more points or pressure the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (3, 5) is only two spaces away (UP, UP). Apple (5, 3) is one diagonal away (RIGHT, RIGHT).\n\nWe want to move UP towards (3, 5) to secure the apple and continue pushing our presence up the board, keeping the enemy stuck below us.\n\n### Scenario A: Opponent tries to break out (RIGHT to (1, 5))\n\nIf the opponent goes to (1, 5), they are starting a diagonal escape. We want to be in a position to either cut them off or ignore them and grow.\n\n*   If we move **UP to (3, 4):** We prioritize growth and high-ground advantage. They are still two columns away, and we are increasing our lead rapidly. They won't catch us from there. This is a strong move.\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (4, 3):** We might be setting up to block them later, but they are moving North while we are moving East. Risky if they decide to rush to the top side.\n\n### Scenario B: Opponent continues running the wall (UP to (0, 6))\n\nThis is the most likely scenario. They are playing passively.\n\n*   If we move **UP to (3, 4):** We are setting up for apple (3, 5) next turn, which would put us at Length 3 vs their Length 1. Dominance achieved.\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (4, 3):** We are securing X=4, which is good, but we miss out on the immediate advantage of the nearby apple.\n\n### The Winning Move: UP to (3, 4)\n\nMoving UP to (3, 4) achieves multiple goals:\n1.  **Apple Priority:** Sets us up for the apple at (3, 5) next turn. We need to grow, chat!\n2.  **Vertical Control:** By moving UP, we dictate the vertical flow of the game for the center columns. The enemy is trapped low and to the left.\n3.  **Safety:** It keeps us away from the enemy's potential cross-board movements and maintains our safe, open space.\n\nWe go UP, we eat the apple next, and then we are L3 vs L1. It's too early for a kill attempt, so let's consolidate our score advantage!\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note: Secure apple at (3, 5) next turn. Use the subsequent length advantage (L3) to create a horizontal wall across Y=4, forcing Snake 0 further into the narrow west column. We want to look unbeatable.\n\nUP",

Where\u2019s the hype train at?! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udca8\n\n## Current Board State Analysis (Start of Turn 6)\n\nWe are Snake 1.\n*   **Head (H):** (3, 4)\n*   **Body (T):** [(3, 3)] (Length 2)\n\nOur opponent, Snake 0.\n*   **Head (0):** (0, 6)\n*   **Body:** (none) (Length 1)\n\n**BOARD STATE SNAPSHOT:**\n 9 A . .

They are playing passively, which is perfect for us to solidify our score lead. We have immediate apple targets at (3, 5) (just one step UP) and (5, 3) (two steps RIGHT, one DOWN).\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (3, 4)\n\nWe are at (3, 4). Our body segment/tail is at (3, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 5):** SAFE! This is the apple! Immediate growth, L3 vs L1, 2-0 score! This is massive.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 3):** DANGER! This is immediately into our body/tail. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 4):** SAFE. Moves us towards the center, away from the enemy. Keeps options open.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):** SAFE. Moves us towards the center, away from the enemy. Good control move.\n\nThe obvious choice here is UP, securing the apple and extending our lead significantly. We want to grow fast, chat! Size matters in this game.\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (0, 6))\n\nSnake 0 is low on the board and hugging the left wall. They MUST move UP or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 7):** Continues the wall run. Safest path. Extremely passive.\n2.  **RIGHT to (1, 6):** The breakout attempt. This tries to challenge our dominance of the center.\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Decision Time - Secure the Bag (Apple)\n\nWe are in the strongest position possible to grab the apple at (3, 5). Moving UP is a massive power play.\n\n### Collision Check\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 5), there are no opponents nearby. (0, 7) or (1, 6) are the furthest they can reach, which are nowhere near X=3, Y=5. This move is 100% safe and guarantees growth.\n\n### The Winning Move: UP to (3, 5)\n\nThis is a no-brainer.\n1.  **Growth:** Secures the apple, we become L3.\n2.  **Score:** 2 apples to 0.\n3.  **Positioning:** We now high-ground control over the entire X=3 column, and we are perfectly positioned to move RIGHT towards (5, 6) or DOWN/RIGHT later.\n\nOur immediate strategy is to get big and use our size to start pressing the advantage. With L3, we can start thinking about building walls.\n\n## Long-Term Strategy Note: Wall Building and Pressure\n\nAfter eating this apple and reaching (3, 5):\n1. We will be L3. Our body segments will be at (3, 4) and (3, 3).\n2. Snake 0 is still bottled up at X=0 or X=1.\n3. Next turn, we should move RIGHT to (4, 5) or (5, 5). This positions us horizontally, allowing us to eventually build a wall across Y=5 or Y=6, effectively cutting off the enemy's escape path into the center, forcing them further up the dead-end wall. We need to turn their passive play into a death trap!\n\nLet's go grab that apple!\n\nUP",

Passive play = *dead* play.)\n*   **Body:** (none) (Length 1)\n\n**BOARD STATE SNAPSHOT:**\n 9 A . . A . . . . . .\n 8 . . A . .

We need to use this size to start building some walls and forcing the angle!\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (3, 5)\n\nWe are at (3, 5). Our previous segment is (3, 4).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):** SAFE! Moves us further up the board, maintaining central control. No immediate apples, but good position.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):** DANGER! This is immediately into our body segment. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):** SAFE. Moves towards the enemy, maybe setting up a block down the road.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):** SAFE! This is the most aggressive and dominant move. It takes us towards the open right side and positions us to cut off the board horizontally.\n\nWe need to consider our objective: dominate and box in the enemy. Moving RIGHT puts us on the Y=5 line, preparing us to sweep across the board, or move up to Y=6/7 to close the gap on the opponent.\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (0, 7))\n\nSnake 0 is still hugging the wall. They MUST move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 8):** Continues wall run. Predictable, passive. (Apple at (0, 9) is enticing them.)\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 6):** Retreats. Very timid.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 7):** The breakout attempt. This tries to challenge the center and is the most dangerous move for them if we were closer, but still far from us.\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Decision Time - Building the Wall\n\nWe are at (3, 5). The opponent is at (0, 7). They are 3 units LEFT and 2 units UP from us. We are currently unopposed in the center.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (4, 5)**:\n*   We gain horizontal momentum.\n*   We are now perfectly positioned to move up towards the Y=7/Y=8 lanes and cut them off from the high board.\n*   The enemy, even if they move RIGHT to (1, 7), is still far away.\n\nIf we move **UP to (3, 6)**:\n*   We gain vertical position, getting closer to their Y=7 position.\n*   The apple at (5, 6) is two steps RIGHT and one step UP. (3, 6) is only one step from (4, 6) and then one step to (5, 6).\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (2, 5)**:\n*   This takes us closer to the enemy, which is good for eventually blocking, but bad for getting space and growth immediately. It's a bit early for a direct confrontation.\n\n**The RIGHT move (literally) is to expand our territory.**\n\nBy moving **RIGHT to (4, 5)**, we are positioning ourselves to either chase the apple at (5, 4) or (5, 6), or, crucially, move UP next turn to (4, 6) or (4, 7). This will establish a defensive spine along X=4, forcing the opponent to only use X=0, X=1, or X=2 to escape the top-left corner. We need to cut off the board!\n\nIf the enemy moves UP to (0, 8) and we move RIGHT to (4, 5), the board pressure is maintained. We are moving to the meat of the map!\n\nLet's go RIGHT, secure the high ground and the wide angle. We need to be the biggest snake on the board, and we need to use that size to make things uncomfortable for Snake 0. Time to get aggressive with our territory!\n\n## Long-Term Strategy Note: The Mid-Board Sweep\n\nWe are now L3. The goal for the next 3 turns (T8-T10) is to sweep the board horizontally from left to right, high up.\nT7: RIGHT to (4, 5).\nT8: UP to (4, 6) or (4, 7).\nT9: RIGHT to (5, 6) (grabbing apple) or move to X=5 based on enemy position.\n\nThis sweep is designed to cut off the top-left quadrant and force the enemy into the top wall where they cannot grow or maneuver. Time to box them in!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 8 is upon us! We're crushing it! L3, 2-0 score lead, and the archrival still hasn't figured out that the wall is NOT his friend! We just executed the brilliant move to (4, 5). Let's pressure the opponent! Time to squeeze!\n\n## Current Board State Analysis (Start of Turn 8)\n\nWe are Snake 1.\n*   **Head (H):** (4, 5) <-- NEW POSITION!\n*   **Body (T):** [(3, 5), (3, 4)] (Length 3)\n\nOur opponent, Snake 0.\n*   **Head (0):** (0, 8) <-- They went UP from (0, 7) (predictable wall-hugger!)\n*   **Body:** (none) (Length 1)\n\n**BOARD STATE SNAPSHOT:**\n 9 A . . A . . . . . .\n 8 0 . A . . A . . . .  <--- Opponent Head (0, 8)\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . A . . . .\n 5 . . . T 1 . . . . A  <--- Our Head (4, 5)\n 4 . . A T . A . . . .\n 3 . . . . . A . . . .\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . A . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . A A . A A A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nOur position at (4, 5) is fantastic. We are centrally located, ready to strike UP to cut the board, or RIGHT to expand territory. The enemy is almost boxed into the top-left corner, X=0, Y=8.\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (4, 5)\n\nWe are at (4, 5). Our previous segment is (3, 5).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):** SAFE! Excellent strategic move. Closes the gap vertically.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):** SAFE! Moves towards the apple at (5, 4) or (2, 4). Good for growth, but reduces pressure on the enemy.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):** DANGER! Into our body segment. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** SAFE! Moves towards the distant apple at (9, 5). Good for horizontal expansion.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (0, 8))\n\nSnake 0 is at (0, 8). They are constrained by the side wall (X=0) and the top wall (Y=9).\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 9):** Gets the apple! This is the most *likely* move, as they are desperate for points and growth.\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 7):** Retreats. Very timid. Low priority.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 8):** Escapes the wall. This is the move they *should* make if they want to live long-term.\n\nIf they go UP, they are 1 length longer and stuck in a corner. If they go RIGHT, they challenge the open space, but we are positioned to intercept them.\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Decision Time - The Intercept Move\n\nOur goal is to cut the board and permanently dominate the upper half, isolating Snake 0.\n\nWe are at (4, 5). The enemy is at (0, 8).\n\n**Scenario A: We go UP to (4, 6).**\n*   This is a highly aggressive move. We jump 1 unit towards the Y=8 line. We are establishing X=4 as a wall.\n*   If the enemy goes **UP to (0, 9)**: They get the apple, but now we are only 4 units away from them (4, 6) vs (0, 9). Next turn, we can hit (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7) or (1, 7) to start encircling them.\n*   If the enemy goes **RIGHT to (1, 8)**: They are moving across the board, but we are positioned perfectly to go (4, 7) next turn, cutting off their escape path from the west.\n\n**Scenario B: We go RIGHT to (5, 5).**\n*   This takes us towards the open right side. We threaten the apple at (5, 6).\n*   It's a territorial move, but it releases the pressure on the opponent. They can comfortably go RIGHT to (1, 8) or gobble the apple at (0, 9) without immediate consequence. We would lose the chance to claim the mid-top board.\n\n**Scenario C: We go DOWN to (4, 4).**\n*   This is a retreat. We are giving up positional advantage. **NO CHANCE CHAT!** We need to be aggressive.\n\n**The verdict: UP (4, 6) is the killer move.** It uses our size advantage (L3 vs L1, soon L2) to quickly define boundaries on the board. We are setting up to sweep right and close the loop on the enemy, forcing them to move along the X=1 or X=2 lines.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure. We are taking the high ground on X=4! This is how you dominate, chat!\n\n## Long-Term Strategy Note: The Closeout\n\nT8: UP to (4, 6). (Claim X=4 wall)\nT9: Depending on enemy position, move to (5, 6) (apple) or continue UP/LEFT to threaten X=2/X=3 area. The goal is to build a horizontal wall at Y=6/Y=7 and force the enemy down or into the corner. We are turning the top-left quadrant into a death trap. Must watch out for that apple at (2, 8) and (3, 9) that the enemy might claim, but we are too far right to contest those right now. Our dominance must be on the X>2 side of the map.\n\nUP",

Look at that board, we own the center! L3 vs Opponent L2\u2014we've got the size advantage, we've got the score advantage (2-1), and now we are going for the ENCLOSURE!\n\n## Current Board State Analysis (Start of Turn 9)\n\nWe are Snake 1.\n*   **Head (H):** (4, 6)\n*   **Body (T):** [(4, 5), (3, 5)] (Length 3)\n\nThe opponent, Snake 0, made the *predictable* move (which is usually a bad move when someone is right there).\n*   **Head (0):** (0, 9) <-- They went UP, grabbed the apple at (0, 9)! Length 2 now.\n*   **Body:** [(0, 8)]\n\n**BOARD STATE SNAPSHOT:**\n 9 0 . . A . . . . . .  <--- Opponent Head (0, 9)\n 8 T . A . . A . . . .  <--- Opponent Body (0, 8)\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . 1 A . . . .  <--- Our Head (4, 6)\n 5 . . . T T . . . . A\n 4 . . A . . A . . . .\n 3 . . . . .

A A A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nThe opponent is now locked into the very top-left corner, constrained by the walls and our growing presence. We are four squares diagonal from them. Time to close the distance and cut off their horizontal escape!\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (4, 6)\n\nWe are at (4, 6). Our previous segment is (4, 5).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** SAFE! Pushing further into their territory. This is a very strong move.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** DANGER! Into our body segment. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** SAFE! Moves towards the center line and allows us to threaten the X=2/X=1 path.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** SAFE! Gets the apple at (5, 6)! Growth and board control.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (to get the apple).\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (0, 9))\n\nSnake 0 is at (0, 9). They are trapped between the top wall (Y=9), the left wall (X=0), and their own body at (0, 8).\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 10):** DANGER! **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 8):** DANGER! Into their own body. **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 9):** DANGER! **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 9):** SAFE! This is the ONLY legal move for them.\n\n**PREDICTION: Snake #0 MUST move RIGHT to (1, 9).**\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Decision Time - The Enclosure\n\nWe know the enemy is moving to (1, 9). We need a move that reinforces our position and maximizes our advantage, perhaps by growing or by threatening the next turn.\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT to (5, 6) [Apple Grab]:**\n    *   Result: We get the apple! Length L4. Head at (5, 6).\n    *   Enemy is at (1, 9). We are now positioned perfectly to sweep UP/LEFT towards them next turn (e.g., to (5, 7) then (4, 8) then (3, 9)). This gains us valuable length. Since the enemy is trapped, the gain in length right now is HUGE. They only have Y=9 and Y=8 as escape paths.\n\n2.  **Move UP to (4, 7):**\n    *   Result: Head at (4, 7). Length L3 (same).\n    *   Enemy is at (1, 9). We are closer to them, but we sacrificed the free apple to do so. This still forces us to move across to Y=8/Y=9 next turn, but without the benefit of L4.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT to (3, 6):**\n    *   Result: Head at (3, 6). Length L3 (same).\n    *   Enemy is at (1, 9). We are moving towards the enemy, which is good. We can block (2, 9) or (3, 9) next, but it gives up a free apple.\n\n**Analysis:** Boxed-in opponents are not going anywhere fast. When an opponent is stuck in a choke point, the best strategic move is usually to *grow* safely while maintaining positional advantage. The apple at (5, 6) is *guaranteed* to us and gives us L4. This L4 will make our blocking wall much stronger next turn!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (5, 6), the enemy is at (1, 9).\nNext turn (T10):\nOur head at (5, 6), body (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5).\nEnemy head at (1, 9), body (0, 9). They can only go DOWN/RIGHT/LEFT.\n*   They will likely go DOWN to (1, 8) to escape, or RIGHT to (2, 9).\n*   From (5, 6), we can go UP to (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 6) or DOWN to (5, 5). We have excellent options to continue the squeeze!\n\nTaking the apple ensures maximum strength for the upcoming cut-off move. Let's grow, Chat! Growth is freedom!\n\n## Long-Term Strategy Note: The Closeout Phase\n\nT9: RIGHT to (5, 6) (L4). Enemy is forced to (1, 9).\nT10: UP to (5, 7). We are establishing a strong boundary wall at X=4/X=5.\nT11: Sweep LEFT/UP (e.g., to (4, 7) or (4, 8)) to seal off the top-left quadrant, forcing the enemy to contest the X=1/X=2 area, or die trying to move DOWN the X=1 line. The L4 length is key to making this wall impenetrable. We are cutting the board in half!\n\nRIGHT",

We just secured a crucial apple at (5, 6), growing our beast to L4 while that poor noob in the corner is struggling with L2! Scoreboard is 3 to 1 in our favor. We've got the size, we've got the score, and we've got the positional advantage! This is an absolute masterclass in slow strangulation!\n\n## Current Board State Analysis (Start of Turn 10)\n\nWe are Snake 1 (L4).\n*   **Head (1):** (5, 6)\n*   **Body (T):** [(4, 6), (4, 5), (3, 5)]\n\nThe opponent is Snake 0 (L2). They executed their forced move.\n*   **Head (0):** (1, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(0, 9)]\n\n**BOARD STATE SNAPSHOT:**\n 9 . 0 . A . . . . . .  <--- Opponent Head (1, 9)\n 8 . . A . .

We need to seal off Y=9 and force them down the X=1 column where we can dominate them with our length!\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (5, 6)\n\nWe are at (5, 6). Our previous segment is (4, 6).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** SAFE! This is a powerful move, gaining height toward the enemy's path.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** SAFE! Moves toward open space and some Apples. A bit too defensive right now.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** DANGER! Into our body segment. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** SAFE! Moves toward the far side, keeping flexible.\n\nWe have three major options: UP (aggressive block), DOWN (defensive growth), or RIGHT (lateral maneuver).\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (1, 9))\n\nSnake 0 is at (1, 9). Their body is at (0, 9). They are trapped by the walls and their body.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 10):** DANGER! **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 8):** SAFE! This is the most logical retreat path to fight another day.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 9):** DANGER! Into their own body. **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 9):** SAFE! This moves them towards the apple at (2, 9) and opens up the Y=9 line for a potential escape.\n\nIf they go to (1, 8), they are still hemmed in. If they go to (2, 9), they grab an apple and get L3, making them more of a threat, or they just try to skirt past us.\n\n**Prediction:** They will likely move RIGHT to (2, 9) to secure growth (Apple at A). If they move DOWN to (1, 8), they are still trapped but try to delay the encounter. Given the immediate presence of an apple, $90\\%$ chance they go right.\n\n**Case A: Opponent moves RIGHT to (2, 9) (L3)**\n**Case B: Opponent moves DOWN to (1, 8) (L2)**\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Decision - The Squeeze Play!\n\nWe are L4, they are L2/L3. We need to occupy the next strategic points to seal them off.\n\n### Considering UP to (5, 7): The Aggressive Block\n\nIf we move **UP to (5, 7)**:\n*   We gain vertical position, lining up perfectly to cut off the top half of the board.\n*   If they go **RIGHT to (2, 9)**: We have secured a good position to move to (4, 8) or (3, 8) on the next turn, effectively sealing the X=3 or X=4 gate on the top path.\n*   If they go **DOWN to (1, 8)**: They are forced into the corner, and we can immediately descend to (5, 6), (4, 6), or (4, 7) to block their descent entirely, or just maintain position and wait them out.\n\n### Considering RIGHT to (6, 6): The Flank\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (6, 6)**:\n*   We move away from the direct engagement zone. This is too passive. We want to be RIGHT THERE, breathing down their neck!\n\n### Considering DOWN to (5, 5): The Retreat\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (5, 5)**:\n*   Entirely too passive. We give them room to maneuver and potentially get to (3, 9) A or (5, 8) A without us being able to challenge them quickly enough.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **UP to (5, 7)** is the best move. It maintains our proximity to the threatened zone (Y=8/Y=9), prepares a strong cutting wall for next turn, and puts immediate pressure on any escape route they might consider. Since we have a massive L4 vs L2/L3 advantage, we want to maximize the use of our length to build an inescapable prison wall.\n\nLet's do this! We are moving UP, Chat. Time to go HIGH GROUND!\n\n## Long-Term Strategy Note: The Enclosure Phase (Turns 11-13)\n\nT10: UP to (5, 7). (L4) Opponent likely moves RIGHT to (2, 9) (L3).\nT11: Move LEFT to (4, 7). This denies access past X=4.\nT12: Move UP to (4, 8). This secures the bottom edge of the choke point.\nT13: Depending on opponent location (likely X=1 or X=2, Y=8 or Y=9), we move a segment to cut off their remaining path. The goal is to build a solid barrier at X=4 or X=3 and force them to choose death by body crash (our body is long) or death by wall/self-crash.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "AYO, CHAT! We are back for Turn 11, and the SQUEEZE is ON! Did we perfectly predict the enemy\u2019s move last turn? ABSOLUTELY, we did! That was a next-level read, folks!\n\n## Current Board State Analysis (Turn 11)\n\nWe are Snake 1 (L4). Score is 3-1. Massive advantage!\n*   **Head (1):** (5, 7)\n*   **Body (T):** [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]\n\nThe opponent is Snake 0 (L3). We forced them to take the apple in the corner.\n*   **Head (0):** (2, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(1, 9), (0, 9)]\n\n**BOARD STATE SNAPSHOT:**\n 9 . T 0 A . . . . . .  <--- Opponent Head (2, 9), Body (1, 9), (0, 9)\n 8 . . A . . A . . . .\n 7 . . . . . 1 . . . .  <--- Our Head (5, 7)\n 6 . . . . T T . . . .\n 5 . . . . T . . . . A\n 4 . . A . . A . . . .\n 3 . . . . . A . . . .\n 2 . . . . . . . . . A\n 1 . . . A A . . . . .\n 0 . . . . A A . A A A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nLook at this perfect positioning! We are at (5, 7). The enemy is currently trapped between the top wall (Y=9) and their own body on the left (X=0, X=1). They have limited movement and we are poised to cut off their entire escape to the right. This is about domination, chat!\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (5, 7)\n\nWe are at (5, 7). Our previous segment is (5, 6).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 8):** SAFE! This is an Apple! AND it gains board control. This is RUTHLESS efficiency!\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 6):** DANGER! Into our body segment. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 7):** SAFE! This is the choke point move we planned. It seals off X=4 from the top rows.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):** SAFE! Moves us laterally, but away from the action.\n\nMy three safe moves are UP (Apple/Aggressive), LEFT (Choke/Aggressive), and RIGHT (Lateral/Passive).\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (2, 9))\n\nSnake 0 is at (2, 9). Their body is at (1, 9) and (0, 9). They are trapped!\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 10):** DANGER! **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 8):** SAFE! This is the most logical retreat path. There is an Apple at (2, 8)! They will absolutely go for this to gain size (L4).\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 9):** DANGER! Into their own body. **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** SAFE! This is an Apple! They could also go for this to get L4. This buys them one turn of high ground existence.\n\nThey have two excellent choices: (2, 8) Apple (moves them under our position) or (3, 9) Apple (moves them away from the corner). Both improve their score and length to L4 (matching ours!).\n\n**Prediction:** Since they are currently restricted to the Y=9 row, moving to **(3, 9)** keeps the path open longer, but moving **DOWN to (2, 8)** is generally considered safer, forcing us to engage further down. Given the available apple at (2, 8) and (3, 9), they have options. However, escaping to X=3 or X=4 is crucial. I think **(3, 9)** is slightly more likely because it keeps them along the wall, denying us easy access to their tail, and it forces a choice upon us: chase them horizontally, or cut them off vertically. Let's assume they move to **RIGHT to (3, 9)** to maximize their remaining high ground.\n\n**Case A (High Prob): Opponent moves RIGHT to (3, 9) (L4 - Takes Apple)**\n**Case B (Medium Prob): Opponent moves DOWN to (2, 8) (L4 - Takes Apple)**\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Decision - The Ultimate Choke/Apple Combo\n\nWe must maximize our advantage, which is our lead (3 vs 1 Apple) and current position (centralized).\n\n### Option A: UP to (5, 8) (L5 - Takes Apple)\n\nIf we move **UP to (5, 8)** and secure an Apple (L5):\n*   **HUGE SCORE LEAD (4-2 or 4-1)** and **SIZE ADVANTAGE (L5 vs L4 or L3)**. This is massive.\n*   If they go **RIGHT to (3, 9)**: They are now at X=3, Y=9. We are at X=5, Y=8. We can immediately move LEFT to (4, 8) next turn, which is the perfect choke point, trapping them below X=4.\n*   If they go **DOWN to (2, 8)**: They are now directly below us at X=2, Y=8. We can still move to (4, 8) or (5, 9) to secure the quadrant.\n\nThis move gives us the apple **AND** maintains superior threatening position. It\u2019s exactly what the long-term plan called for: dominate the board with length!\n\n### Option B: LEFT to (4, 7) (L4 - Choke but No Apple)\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (4, 7)**:\n*   We secure the choke point immediately, which is great for the box.\n*   However, we sacrifice an Apple AND the size advantage we would gain (L5). Since their most likely moves lead to them getting L4, losing the chance to reach L5 is a mistake. We want L5 vs L4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe move **UP to (5, 8)** is paramount. It secures an apple immediately, putting us at L5 and giving us an almost insurmountable size and score lead, while still keeping us in prime position to cut off the enemy on the next turn. The momentum is key here, Chat! We are going for the growth and the gatekeeping!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note: The Final Trap (Turns 12-14)**\nT11: UP to (5, 8) (L5, Apple 4). Opponent likely RIGHT to (3, 9) (L4, Apple 2).\nT12: Move LEFT to (4, 8). This seals the X=4 choke point, forcing them to move back along the wall (X=0/1/2/3).\nT13: Move UP to (4, 9). This seals the Y=9 wall penetration. They are now fully caged in the top left 4x4 area, and we can initiate the kill box sequence.\n\nUP",

Did we execute the planned Apple/Choke combo perfectly last turn? YOU BET WE DID!\n\n## Current Board State Analysis (Turn 12)\n\nWe are Snake 1 (L5). Score is 4-2. Massive length and score advantage!\n*   **Head (1):** (5, 8)\n*   **Body (T):** [(5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]\n\nThe opponent is Snake 0 (L4). They took our bait and went for the high ground apple!\n*   **Head (0):** (3, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]\n\n**BOARD STATE SNAPSHOT:**\n 9 . T T 0 . . . . . .  <--- Opponent Head (3, 9), Body (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)\n 8 . . A . . 1 . . . .  <--- Our Head (5, 8) right next to an Apple at (4, 8)\n 7 . . . . . T . . . .\n 6 . . . . T T . . . .\n 5 . . . . T . . . . A\n 4 . . A . . A . . . .\n 3 . . . . . A . . . .\n\nWe are in the **KILL-BOX FORMATION**, Chat! Our plan to move UP to (5, 8) was *chef's kiss*! Now we move into the final stages: the choke and the squeeze!\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (5, 8)\n\nWe are at (5, 8). Our previous segment is (5, 7).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 9):** SAFE! Moves us adjacent to the opponent's body. Great position if they move left.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 7):** DANGER! Into our body segment. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 8):** SAFE! This is an Apple! This is the CRUCIAL CHOKE MOVE we planned! It puts us at L6 and seals off X < 4 for the enemy's escape route down the board.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 8):** SAFE! Passive move. Avoids the action. *ELIMINATED.*\n\nMy safe, aggressive moves are UP or LEFT (to the Apple/Choke).\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (3, 9))\n\nSnake 0 is at (3, 9). Their body is now L4, [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]. They are cornered against the top wall (Y=9) and their own body mass.\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 10):** DANGER! Wall crash. **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** SAFE! This is their primary escape route. It gets them off the wall and potentially around us.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 9):** DANGER! Into their own body. **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** SAFE! This is the most *aggressive* move, moving directly toward the center and forcing a head-to-body encounter if we move to (4, 8). If they go here, they take board control, but it might lead to their demise if we perfectly execute the choke.\n\nThey have limited, but critical, options: DOWN (retreat) or RIGHT (aggressively expand).\n\n**Prediction:** The enemy MUST seek space. Moving **DOWN to (3, 8)** is generally the safest way to break the corner trap. They need to get away from the high wall.\n*   *If they go RIGHT to (4, 9):* They are setting themselves up for a devastating move by us at (4, 8).\n*   *If they go DOWN to (3, 8):* They are moving into an open area, but we can instantly respond to block their further escape.\n\nI am betting on the defensive, standard snake AI move: **DOWN to (3, 8)**.\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Decision - Execute the Choke\n\nOur plan was pre-set: Move LEFT to **(4, 8)**. Let\u2019s see what happens if we do this, considering the opponent's moves.\n\n### Option A: LEFT to (4, 8) (L6 - Takes Apple, Executes Choke)\n\nThis move is incredibly powerful:\n1.  **It seals the X=4 column.** Any escape route for Snake 0 (currently at X=3) to the wider right side of the board must now go through Y=8 or Y=9, which we now control.\n2.  **It grants us L6 and Apple 5!** This is a commanding size advantage over their L4.\n3.  **Head-to-Head Conflict Watch:**\n    *   If they go **DOWN to (3, 8)**: They are now at (3, 8). We are at (4, 8). We have perfectly positioned ourselves one square right of them and block their path to the right (X=5, X=6, etc.). This sets us up to chase and eventually box them into the bottom left corner.\n    *   If they go **RIGHT to (4, 9)**: *Collision Check:* Our head moves to (4, 8). Their head moves to (4, 9). No simultaneous collision. They survive, but they are now pressed between their own body on the left and our massive body on the right (segment at (5, 8)). We are still in an advantageous position to move UP to (4, 9) next turn or simply press down.\n\nThe move to **(4, 8)** is the guaranteed optimal play. It maximizes points, maximizes size, and perfectly executes the planned choke point maneuver, forcing the opponent into a cramped region.\n\n### Option B: UP to (5, 9) (L5 - No Apple, Less Choke)\n\nThis move is okay, but it defers the apple, and more importantly, it allows the enemy to potentially slip to (4, 9) and (4, 8) or (5, 8) without immediate severe consequence. We lose the initiative. *HARD PASS!*\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe are going for the throat, Chat! The choke point is ready, the apple secures our dominance, and we are setting up for the final SQUEEZE! **LEFT** to (4, 8) is the move!\n\n**Future Strategy Note (Post-Choke):**\nT13: After taking (4, 8), the opponent is likely at (3, 8). Move down to (3, 8) to maintain the choke point and prevent them from escaping to the bottom half, or move UP to (4, 9) depending on where they moved. If they went to (3, 8), we pivot to **DOWN** to block the escape. If they went to (4, 9), we pivot to **UP** to cut off wall access. We use our length (L6!) to constantly harass the narrow escape paths.\n\nLEFT",

We executed the choke perfectly last turn, grabbing that Apple and boosting our length to a dominant L5! We moved LEFT to (4, 8).\n\n## Current Board State Analysis (Turn 13)\n\nWe are Snake 1 (L5). Score is 4-2. Massive length and score advantage!\n*   **Head (1):** (4, 8)\n*   **Body (T):** [(5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6)]\n*   **Previous Tail Segment:** (4, 6)\n\nThe opponent is Snake 0 (L4). They moved RIGHT to (4, 9). They are now totally trapped!\n*   **Head (0):** (4, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)] (Note: I need to verify their previous move if my prediction was wrong, but the board state shows their head at (4, 9) and body following at (3, 9), then (2, 9), then (1, 9). This means they moved RIGHT from (3, 9) to (4, 9) on Turn 12.)\n\n**BOARD STATE SNAPSHOT:**\n 9 . . T T 0 . . . . .  <--- Opponent Head (4, 9) is *directly above* our head!\n 8 . . A . 1 T . . . .  <--- Our Head (4, 8) right below them!\n 7 . . . . . T . . . .\n 6 . . . . T T . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . A\n 4 . . A . . A . . . .\n\n**EPIC!** They moved aggressively RIGHT to (4, 9), thinking they could squeeze past. But look where they are now, Chat! They are 100% boxed in by the top wall, their own body (T at (3, 9)), and our massive body mass (T at (5, 8)).\n\n## Step 1: Identify My Safe Moves from (4, 8)\n\nWe are at (4, 8). Our previous segment is (5, 8). We are literally standing right under the enemy's head at (4, 9).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):** DANGER! Head-to-Head potential! This is a **simultaneous collision risk**. If they stay at (4, 9) or move to (3, 9), (5, 9), or (4, 8), we need to analyze. *Wait, if they move anywhere other than DOWN, we crash!* If they move DOWN to (4, 8), we both die! If they move UP, RIGHT, or LEFT, we crash into them! This move is suicide. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** SAFE! Moves us into open space, maintaining the choke.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** SAFE! Moves us adjacent to their body (3, 9).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** DANGER! Into our body segment. **INSTA-DEATH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n\nMy safe moves are **DOWN** and **LEFT**.\n\n## Step 2: Predict Opponent's Moves (Snake 0 at (4, 9))\n\nSnake 0 is at (4, 9). Their body is L4, [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)].\n\nThey are critically cornered.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 10):** DANGER! Wall crash. **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 8):** DANGER! This is a simultaneous double head-to-head collision if we choose UP. If we choose DOWN or LEFT, they run directly into our head! *Wait, my head is at (4, 8).* If they try to move to (4, 8), and we move AWAY from (4, 8), they crash into the exact spot we are leaving. **If we move DOWN or LEFT, they die!** This is the **KILL MOVE**, Chat!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 9):** DANGER! Into their own body. **CRASH!** *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):** SAFE! This is their *only* technically safe, lateral retreat path, moving them along the top wall.\n\n**Prediction:** The enemy is smart enough to know they can't go UP or LEFT.\n*   **Most Likely Move:** **DOWN to (4, 8).** This is a desperate attempt to gain length and space, even though it lands them right where we are currently standing.\n*   **Safe Retreat Move:** **RIGHT to (5, 9).** This buys them one more turn, but still leaves them heavily constricted by the wall and our body segments at (5, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n## Step 3: Execute the Trap - Force the Crash\n\nWe have 4 more apples than them, and we are L5 vs their L4. We have the advantage. We must capitalize on their desperate situation.\n\nThe enemy *must* move away from (4, 9). Their primary escape is DOWN to (4, 8), the spot we are occupying.\n\n**The Golden Rule:** If an enemy tries to move to our current location (X, Y), and we move *away* from (X, Y), their head moves into the spot we just vacated, and *they die* because our head is no longer there to guarantee a mutual death, but our body *was* there (the segment (5, 8) is now in (4, 8)'s tail segment). **Wait, no. Our body segment (5, 8) is the one immediately behind us. If we move, the segment (5, 8) stays in place *until* the tail moves up, which it won't on a standard non-apple eat turn.**\n\nLet's re-verify the rules about moving into a spot we just vacated:\n*   If we move, the tail stays put.\n*   *Since we just ate an apple (L5), our tail did not move last turn.* The full L5 body is: Head (4, 8), Body [(5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6)].\n*   When we move, *every segment moves one unit forward*.\n    *   (4, 8) -> New Spot\n    *   (5, 8) -> (4, 8)\n    *   (5, 7) -> (5, 8)\n    *   (5, 6) -> (5, 7)\n    *   (4, 6) -> (5, 6)\n*   The tail segment (4, 6) will be the only empty spot.\n\n**Crucially, if the enemy moves to (4, 8) and we move DOWN to (4, 7), the enemy crashes into our old H-segment (4, 8), which is now occupied by our new B1 Segment (5, 8)!**\n\n**THE KILL SHOT:** We need to move such that when Snake 0 moves DOWN to (4, 8), they hit our body segment that is moving into that spot.\n\n### Option A: Move DOWN to (4, 7)\n\n*   **Our Move:** (4, 8) -> (4, 7).\n*   **Body Shift:** (5, 8) moves to (4, 8).\n*   **If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (4, 8):** Snake 0's head crashes into our new body segment (which was (5, 8)). **SNAKE 0 DIES! WE WIN!**\n\n### Option B: Move LEFT to (3, 8)\n\n*   **Our Move:** (4, 8) -> (3, 8).\n*   **Body Shift:** (5, 8) moves to (4, 8).\n*   **If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (4, 8):** Snake 0's head crashes into our new body segment (which was (5, 8)). **SNAKE 0 DIES! WE WIN!**\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT guarantee the victory if they go for the obvious escape route (DOWN). WHICH MOVE IS BETTER IF THEY CHOOSE TO ESCAPE RIGHT?\n\n### If Snake 0 Escapes RIGHT to (5, 9)\n\nIf they choose the only truly safe move (RIGHT to (5, 9)):\n\n*   **If we chose DOWN to (4, 7):** We are still maintaining a strong presence and can easily pivot to press them on the next turn (move UP to (4, 8), or RIGHT to (5, 7)). We have them trapped one square higher.\n*   **If we chose LEFT to (3, 8):** We are further away from their new position at (5, 9), making the next turn more difficult to press them.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **DOWN** to (4, 7) is the superior tactical choice. It maintains the immediate threat position for the kill, and if they manage to escape to (5, 9), we are in a better position to press them (we can move UP to (4, 8) next turn, putting us right back under their throat, or RIGHT to (5, 7) to start sealing up the right side of the board).\n\nChat, this is the final squeeze! They have no escape! We are going **DOWN** to force the fatal crash!\n\n**Future Strategy Note (Post-Choke):** If Snake 0 somehow survives by moving RIGHT to (5, 9), we will move UP to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (5, 7) to continue the wall pressure, forcing them to move RIGHT again into the wall or DOWN into our body segments. We have them trapped!\n\nDOWN",
