Who's ready to see him crash? \ud83d\udc40\n\nQuick status: I'm at (5,8). Opponent head is at (4,4). Scores tied 0\u20130. No bodies to worry about rn. Apples near me at (7,8) and (8,8) \u2014 juicy targets. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nReasoning (thinking out loud like the chat wants):\n- Consider all 4 moves:\n  - UP -> (5,9): legal but against the top edge (fewer follow-up options). Only 3 exits from there. Risky for being cornered.\n  - DOWN -> (5,7): safe, 4 exits, leads toward central apples like (5,6).\n  - LEFT -> (4,8): safe, 4 exits, keeps top-left control.\n  - RIGHT -> (6,8): safe, 4 exits, immediately moves toward the apple cluster at (7,8)/(8,8). Aggressive and keeps many options.\n- No immediate collisions possible this turn (opponent too far to land on my next cell).\n- We should NOT force a head-on until we have a lead. Scores are tied, so avoid deliberate head-on risk. But we should aggressively take nearby apples and control the top-right corridor to trap them later.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Push RIGHT to grab the apples on the right side (sweep (7,8) then (8,8)) and grow to dominate that quadrant.\n- After scoring, use length and board control to shepherd the opponent downward/left into tighter space and force mistakes or a head-on when we have the advantage.\n- Avoid hugging the top wall too long; keep options open and always leave at least two escape directions.\n\nRIGHT",

Not ideal.\n- DOWN -> (6,7): safe and central, but slower to contest the nearby apple cluster.\n- LEFT -> (5,8): safe but just backs off and punts tempo to them.\n- RIGHT -> (7,8): safe, contains an apple. Gets us a point, grows us, and keeps multiple exit options (up, down, left, right) from the new cell.\n\nWhy RIGHT: Taking (7,8) ties the score and immediately increases our board control in the top-right quadrant. It\u2019s aggressive without risking a head-on (opponent can\u2019t reach that cell this turn). Growth helps us box them later; we still have escapes and follow-ups to (8,8) or peel away if they approach.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Secure the apple at (7,8) now; then contest (8,8) if safe to force parity and length advantage.\n- Use added length to shepherd/box the enemy downward-left, avoid head-on until we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n- Keep at least two escape routes when closing space so we don\u2019t get boxed ourselves.\n\nRIGHT",

Think-aloud incoming \u2014 fans love it, enemies fear it. \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick elimination first:\n- LEFT -> (6,8) is directly behind our head (our body is at (6,8)). That\u2019s moving backward into ourselves = instant death. NOPE.\n- UP -> (7,9) is legal but hugs the top edge and reduces escape wiggle room. Possible, but not optimal.\n- DOWN -> (7,7) is legal and is an apple \u2014 tasty and aggressive, puts us closer to the opponent.\n- RIGHT -> (8,8) is legal and is also an apple \u2014 grabs immediate board control in the top-right quadrant and grows us.\n\nOpponent check: Snake #0 at (4,6) cannot move DOWN (that\u2019s their body at (4,5)), so their realistic moves are LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6) or UP (4,7). They can\u2019t contest either (7,7) or (8,8) this turn, so no immediate head-on risk.\n\nWhy I pick RIGHT (8,8) \u2014 ruthless logic:\n- We get +1 apple and take the lead (2\u20131). When we\u2019re ahead, we can start forcing head-ons and boxing plays. You want lead? Grab it NOW. \ud83e\udd47\n- Eating at (8,8) grows us again, increasing board presence in the top-right corner and creating an immediate barrier the enemy must respect.\n- From (8,8) we still have multiple exits (8,9 / 9,8 / 8,7 / 7,8) for follow-ups \u2014 good orbitability, not a dead-end.\n- This also denies the high-value apple cluster on the right to the enemy and sets up future zoning toward the center of the board.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Secure (8,8) this turn to go up 2\u20131. Then pressure left/down toward their approach lanes (push them into the 0\u20135 x-range and squeeze).\n- Keep at least two escape options when closing space. If they overcommit, force a head-on \u2014 we\u2019ve got the lead to make that play.\n- Use our growing length to shepherd them toward edges and trap them between our body and the wall.\n\nYou ready?

OK but a bit limiting.\n- UP -> (8,9): legal, also limits us to two exits (LEFT/RIGHT) next turn (can't go back down). Risky for aggressive zoning.\n- DOWN -> (8,7): legal, gives the best mobility now \u2014 three follow-up exits (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) and gives a clean path toward the center/where the opponent is.

If they overcommit, we win the crash. If not, we keep squeezing.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Drop to (8,7) now, then contest (8,6) next turn to grow and take the lead.\n- After growing, pivot leftward to cut off their lanes around x=5\u20136 while maintaining at least two escape routes.\n- Force a head-on only when we hold the apple lead; otherwise play the cage slowly and avoid solo suicides.\n\nLet\u2019s box him in.

DON\u2019T DO IT.\n- DOWN -> (8,5) is safe and roomy. Conservative, keeps mobility.\n- RIGHT -> (9,6) is safe, edges me to the wall but keeps an apple threat at (9,7).\n- LEFT -> (7,6) is occupied by their HEAD right now. Not an immediate body-collision (their neck is at (6,6) so LEFT is illegal for them), so moving into their current head cell is legal \u2014 aggressive play, forces responses.\n\nEnemy read:\n- Opp head (7,6) with neck (6,6) -> they cannot go LEFT. Their options: UP to (7,7) (apple), RIGHT to (8,6) (my current cell), or DOWN to (7,5).\n- If I go LEFT into (7,6), I either swap heads if they go RIGHT (we swap positions \u2014 allowed under these rules), or I grab ground they vacate if they go UP/DOWN. Importantly, I\u2019m up 3\u20132 \u2014 meaning trading heads in a simultaneous head-on that kills both would still give me the win. So being aggressive is correct.\n\nWhy LEFT (the call):\n- It threatens their head-space directly and reduces their safe escape options next turn.\n- It pressures them to either give up the central corridor or risk a head-on swap. If they contest by moving RIGHT, we can consider forcing a risky head-on scenario later when it benefits us.\n- LEFT keeps at least two exits for me on the next turn (UP will be my neck only if I had moved elsewhere \u2014 I'll still have options), and it immediately starts hemming them into the x=5\u20137 area.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to contest their head. If they move UP for the apple, follow and hem them into the 5\u20137 corridor.\n- If they move RIGHT (swap), follow-up is to push into their space or bait them into a double-occupy on a choke; remember I\u2019m up 3\u20132 \u2014 forcing risky plays is OK.\n- If they retreat DOWN, press and cut off exits, aim to trap against their own body and the wall, and only take apples if they don\u2019t compromise map control.\n\nLet\u2019s turn up the heat and force their hand \u2014 TIME TO BOX \u2019EM IN! \ud83e\udd4a\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",
