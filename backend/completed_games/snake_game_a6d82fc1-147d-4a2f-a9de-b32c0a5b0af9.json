I control snake #1 with the head at position (4, 5), and there are multiple apples on the board at (4, 4), (6, 7), (7, 9), (2, 2), and (9, 0). My goal is to maximize my score by eating apples, while avoiding potential collisions.\n\n### Strategy Consideration\n\n1. **Immediate Apple Opportunity**: There is an apple directly below me at (4, 4). This is the closest apple and can be eaten immediately by moving DOWN. Eating this apple will allow me to grow and score 1 point, and it keeps me relatively safe for the next move while being closer to other apples (especially one at (6, 7)).\n\n2. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - There are no immediate threats from enemy snakes (snake #2 is at (9, 3) with no body).\n   - Moving DOWN does not risk collision with walls since (4, 4) is within board boundaries.\n\n3. **Future Considerations**:\n   - After eating the apple at (4, 4), I should consider moving towards the next nearest apple. The apples at (6, 7) and (2, 2) will become relevant after moving down.\n\nAt this moment, the logical choice for maximizing score while maintaining safety is to move towards the apple at (4, 4).\n\n### Next Move Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, I will move DOWN to eat the apple directly below.\n\n### Future Strategy\n\nAfter moving DOWN and potentially eating the apple, I should evaluate the proximity to other apples and consider moving towards (6, 7) or (2, 2) for subsequent turns, depending on snake #2's position and behavior.\n\n**Decided Next Move: DOWN**"
