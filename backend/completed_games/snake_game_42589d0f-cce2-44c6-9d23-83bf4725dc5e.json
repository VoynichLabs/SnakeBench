To reach it, moving right and up seems logical.\n\nPotential moves:\n- Moving RIGHT: from (2,3) to (3,3), then (4,3), ..., up to x=8.\n- Moving UP: from (2,3) to (2,4), then (2,5)..., but that may be longer than needed.\n- Moving LEFT or DOWN looks dangerous as they may lead to walls or dead ends.\n\nWe must avoid the enemy at (1,3). Moving left would be unsafe because (1,3) is occupied, and moving into it would cause collision.\n\nGiven the apples' positions, the most strategic move seems to be moving RIGHT, aiming to progress towards apples at higher x-values and possibly move closer to (8,3) or (8,5). Moving RIGHT also avoids the enemy snake at (1,3).\n\nCheck for immediate hazards:\n- Moving RIGHT from (2,3) to (3,3): no enemy or wall there.\n- Next moves can be planned accordingly.\n\nDecision:\n- Moving RIGHT seems safe and aligned with the goal of collecting apples.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

In the last move info, it says the head is at (2,3)? That seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, the \"Your snake ID: 0\" is at position (8,3) with body at [(7,3)]. The last move says the direction was RIGHT, moving from (2,3) to (3,3). That seems inconsistent with the previous position info.\n\nActually, the description states: \"Your snake's head is at (2,3)\", which conflicts with the initial position at (8,3). It appears there's a mismatch in the described scenario. \n\n**Let's clarify:**\n\n- Initial position: (8,3) (your current snake head position with body [(7,3)]).\n- Last move: RIGHT.\n\nIf last move was RIGHT, from (8,3) to (9,3). That seems consistent.\n\nHowever, in the previous reasoning, it mentions the snake's head at (2,3), which appears to be a mistake.\n\nSince the last move was RIGHT and current position should be at (9,3).\n\nBut the problem's description says:\n\n> Your snake's head is at (2,3)\n\nwhich is contradictory.\n\nGiven the context, I will assume that the initial position info is correct: at (8,3), with body at [(7,3)]. The last move was RIGHT, so new position is (9,3).\n\nThe apple at (8,3) is at (8,3), and the snake is at (9,3). That means the snake has just moved to the right of the apple, which suggests the apple is behind, not ahead.\n\nBut because the apple at (8,3) is *close* to the initial position, and the last move was right, perhaps the snake has just moved onto the apple at (8,3). Alternatively, there could be a mistake in the description.\n\nGiven these discrepancies, I will proceed with the initial assumption:\n\n- The snake's current position is at (8,3), facing right, just moved onto the apple at (8,3).\n- The snake's length increased (if it just ate the apple).\n- The goal is to continue toward the nearest apple at (9,6), (8,5), (8,9), (0,0), or (5,9).\n\nChecking the positions:\n\n- Our snake is at (8,3). The closest apple is at (8,5) or (8,9), or (9,6).\n\nFrom (8,3):\n\n- Moving UP (to (8,4)) moves closer to the apple at (8,5). \n- Moving RIGHT (to (9,3)) is horizontal, potentially leading toward (9,6).\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT would risk moving away from the apples or hitting walls.\n\nThinking through:\n\n- Moving UP seems promising to approach (8,5).\n\nIs there any obstacle?\n\n- Enemy snake at (1,6), body at (1,6), (0,6), which is quite far from current position. \n- No immediate threats in the immediate cells above.\n\n**Potential hazards?**\n\n- Moving UP from (8,3) to (8,4):\n  - Is (8,4) safe? Check if it's occupied:\n\nFrom the map:\n\nRow 8: (index 8):\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nNo obstacles listed at (8,4).\n\n- Wall is at y=9, so moving upward is safe.\n\n- The snake's body is only at (7,3), so (8,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, moving RIGHT toward (9,3):\n\n- The target apple at (9,6) is to the right, but moving right from (8,3) to (9,3) is two steps away from the apple at (9,6).\n\n- Moving UP directly toward (8,4), then (8,5), would get us closer to the apple.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n- Continue moving UP to reach (8,4), (8,5), towards the apple at (8,5). \n- Once at (8,5), plan to turn towards other apples as needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Next move: UP\n\n**Next turn, I want to continue approaching the nearest apple via vertical movement, avoiding unnecessary risk.** \n\nDecided move: UP"

The apple isn't nearby on the right side but is at (8,5) directly above.\n\n- Move LEFT: to (7,3).\n\n- Move DOWN: to (8,2).\n\nBetween these options, moving to the RIGHT seems promising because:\n\n- From (8,3) to (9,3): safe if (9,3) isn't occupied.\n\nChecking surroundings:\n\n- (9,3): free space, no body segments or enemies there.\n\n- Moving RIGHT aligns us to eventually go UP to reach (8,5), potentially avoiding collision with our own body at (8,4).\n\nConsidering that, perhaps better to move RIGHT first, then move UP later to reach the apple.\n\nWe should avoid moving LEFT or DOWN for now, as they wouldn't bring us closer to the apples and could potentially lead to dead ends.\n\n**Next, plan:**\n\n- Move RIGHT from (8,3) to (9,3).\n\nThis move is safe, avoids self-collision, and keeps us on the path toward the apple at (8,5).
