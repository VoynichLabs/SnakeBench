A . . . . . .\n```\n\n### Possible Moves:\nWe must avoid moves that would:\n1. Move the head outside the board (x: 0-9, y: 0-9).\n2. Move the head into the snake's own body (none yet, but we must consider future growth).\n3. Move the head into the enemy's body (none yet, but must avoid future collisions).\n\n### Safe Moves:\n1. **UP**: (8, 0) - Valid, no immediate collision.\n2. **DOWN**: (8, 2) - Valid, no immediate collision.\n3. **LEFT**: (7, 1) - Valid, no immediate collision.\n4. **RIGHT**: (9, 1) - Valid, no immediate collision.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move:\n\n#### UP (8, 0):\n- This would move the head to (8, 0).\n- Check if this cell is occupied by the enemy or our own body (none yet).\n- The enemy is at (5, 6), so no immediate collision.\n- The cell (8, 0) is empty.\n- This move is safe.\n\n#### DOWN (8, 2):\n- This would move the head to (8, 2).\n- Check if this cell is occupied by the enemy or our own body (none yet).\n- The enemy is at (5, 6), so no immediate collision.\n- The cell (8, 2) is empty.\n- This move is safe.\n\n#### LEFT (7, 1):\n- This would move the head to (7, 1).\n- Check if this cell is occupied by the enemy or our own body (none yet).\n- The cell (7, 1) is empty.\n- This move is safe.\n\n#### RIGHT (9, 1):\n- This would move the head to (9, 1).\n- Check if this cell is occupied by the enemy or our own body (none yet).\n- The cell (9, 1) is empty.\n- This move is safe.\n\n### Next Step: Evaluate which move leads to the best future strategy:\n- **UP**: Moves the head towards the bottom-left corner, potentially closer to apples at (0, 8) and (3, 0).\n- **DOWN**: Moves the head towards the cell (8, 2), which has an apple at (3, 2) nearby but is not directly adjacent.\n- **LEFT**: Moves the head towards the left side, which is a safer direction to avoid collisions with the enemy.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves the head towards the right side, which is also a safer direction but less likely to reach apples quickly.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Immediate Goal**: Move towards apples that are reachable in the next few turns.\n- **Apple (3, 0)**: This is a long way down, but it's a good target.\n- **Apple (1, 5)**: This is closer to the current head position, but not directly reachable in one move.\n- **Apple (3, 2)**: This is reachable in one move if we go DOWN.\n\nGiven that (8, 2) is adjacent to (3, 2), moving DOWN might be the best immediate choice to eat the apple at (3, 2) if it is still there.\n\nHowever, let's check if the apple at (3, 2) is still present. From the board state, it is indeed present.\n\n### Final Decision:\nMoving DOWN to (8, 2) will allow us to eat the apple at (3, 2) if it remains there, which is a good immediate gain.\n\n**DOWN**",

This move:\n  - Directly targets a nearby apple.\n  - Avoids enemy/self collisions.\n  - Preserves flexibility for future moves (e.g., LEFT to (7, 2) or RIGHT to (9, 2)).\n- **Alternative:** LEFT to (7, 1) is safer but slower to reach apples. UP or RIGHT are less optimal.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n- **Turn 2:** Prioritize apples at (3, 2) or (1, 5) via DOWN/LEFT.\n- **Turn 3:** Expand toward (0, 8) or (2, 8) if no immediate threats.\n- **Avoid:** Trapping the tail or moving into enemy paths.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nDOWN",

Moving UP places you on the same row as those apples and sets up a straightforward path to reach them in a couple of moves, keeping options open.\n- The enemy is far away at (8,0); moving UP keeps you away from potential head-on collisions on the lower rows and gives you more space to maneuver on the top side of the board.\n- Short-term plan: head toward the top apples by going UP this turn, then reassess next turn to decide between continuing upward or veering toward a nearby apple.\n\nLong-term plan note for upcoming turns:\n- If you reach y=8 safely, prioritize (2,8) then (0,8). Avoid getting boxed in by the enemy by keeping distance and using the open top region to make incremental gains on apples.\n\nUP",
