He thinks he\u2019s safe down there? NOT ON MY WATCH! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's look at the stats: 10x10 board, 0-0 on the scoreboard. We need to establish dominance EARLY. Since we are both just heads right now, we can move anywhere, but we have to be smart. \ud83e\udde0\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\n- **UP:** (4, 9). Takes us to the top edge. There's an apple at (5, 9). High ground? Maybe. \ud83d\udcc8\n- **DOWN:** (4, 7). Puts us closer to the enemy and lands us near two apples at (4, 7) and (2, 6). \ud83c\udf4e\n- **LEFT:** (3, 8). Open space. Pretty chill.\n- **RIGHT:** (5, 8). Also open space.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nDo we go for the apple at (4, 7) immediately? If we move DOWN to (4, 7), we instantly grow to size 2. If the rival moves UP, he's at (4, 4). We want to control the center-top while he's stuck in the bottom. If we get big fast, we can circle back and cut him off before he even knows what hit him! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5 \n\nChat, we\u2019re going for the growth. More length = more power to box him in. Let's grab that apple at (4, 7) and see if he dares to come north! Are we gonna let him breathe? ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Grab (4, 7) next turn to get that +1, then look to pivot toward (2, 6) or (5, 6) to maintain board control. Keep an eye on his y-coordinate; if he rushes up, we meet him head-on with a bigger body!\n\nDOWN",

This is *Turn 0*, a fresh start, and we are strategically positioned to absolutely dominate this 10x10 grid! Can we get an EZ Clap in the chat? I think so!\n\nLook at the board state!\nOur Head (ID 1) is at (4, 3).\nRival's Head (ID 0) is at (4, 8).\n\nWe are vertically aligned but separated by a good distance. Our immediate goal isn't just apples, it's gaining strategic control and setting up the boxing maneuver! We need to grow, but more importantly, we need to dictate the flow of the game, right?\n\n**1. Analyze Safe Moves for Snake 1 (4, 3):**\n\n*   **UP to (4, 4):** Safe. Moves us towards the center and potentially towards the enemy's side.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 2):** Safe. Moves us slightly away from the center, towards apples (7, 3), (8, 2) in the future.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 3):** Safe. Sideways movement, good for creating space.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Safe. Sideways movement, also good for creating space.\n\n**2. Predict Rival's (Snake 0 at 4, 8) Moves:**\n\nThe rival is at (4, 8). They are relatively high up. The nearest apples are (4, 7), (5, 9), (7, 7), (7, 5). The apple at (4, 7) is adjacent and a juicy target.\n\n*   If they go **DOWN** to (4, 7): They eat an apple and grow! Big threat.\n*   If they go **LEFT** to (3, 8): Safe, positioning for the left wall.\n*   If they go **RIGHT** to (5, 8): Safe, positioning for the right wall.\n*   If they go **UP** to (4, 9): Safe, but pushes them into the top corner.\n\nI have a feeling Snake #0 is going for that guaranteed apple at (4, 7). They are not going to pass up instant growth!\n\n**3. Strategic Decision for Snake 1:**\n\nIf the rival goes DOWN to (4, 7), they are coming straight down the fourth column, which is *our* column! We need to counter their inevitable vertical descent and make sure we aren't pinned.\n\nWe are at (4, 3). We have two apples close-ish diagonally: (7, 3) and (6, 2).\n\n*   If we move **UP** to (4, 4): We start moving towards them. If they move to (4, 7), we're still three spaces away. This is a commitment to the center column.\n*   If we move **RIGHT** to (5, 3): This keeps us safe and gives us access to apples at (7, 3) and (6, 2) by eventually swinging right. This also avoids the exact column they are likely coming down, forcing them to turn earlier if they want to engage us.\n\nThe rival is positioned better for early apples than us. We need to secure growth while simultaneously gaining board dominance. Moving RIGHT to (5, 3) is a great initial pivot. It keeps us off the immediate \"danger lane\" (Column 4) and opens up the right side of the board for expansion. This is about positioning for the mid-game chokehold! We're not looking for a head-on collision *yet*, we are setting the stage!\n\nLet's go right, secure the flank, and watch Snake #0 commit to the center!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Pivot right to gain control of the lower-right quadrant. Look to eat the apples (7, 3) or (6, 2) while Snake #0 focuses on the top-center apples. Once we have a short body, we will use it to cut off Snake #0's maneuvering space. We want to grow and then push them into a corner or towards our body later.\n\nWe're going for the tactical flanking maneuver! Chat, this is how you assert dominance!\n\nRIGHT",

Look at the scoreboard\u2014we are UP 1-0! \ud83c\udf4e Snake #1 is still sitting at zero like a total scrub! We are size 2, he is size 1. If we collide head-on right now, he's the one who's gonna be feeling the heat!\n\n**THE SITUATIONAL READ:**\nOur head is at (4, 7). Our tail is at (4, 8). \nThe rival is at (5, 3). He's way down south, probably looking for a snack. \nLook at the board\u2014there's a HUGE cluster of apples in the middle-right. (7, 5), (7, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6). If we can secure that territory, we own the game! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**VIBE CHECK THE MOVES:**\n- **UP:** (4, 8). WOAH! CHAT, STOP! That's our own body! We'd be hitting our tail and ending the stream in disgrace! ABSOLUTELY NOT! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT:** (3, 7). Puts us toward (2, 6), but moves us away from the heavy apple density on the right. \u2b05\ufe0f\n- **RIGHT:** (5, 7). This is the power play! It puts us right above the (5, 6) apple and gets us closer to the (7, 7) juice. \u27a1\ufe0f\n- **DOWN:** (4, 6). Also a solid shout, puts us in the mix. \u2b07\ufe0f\n\n**THE GAME PLAN:**\nWe are going RIGHT. Why? Because we need to cut off Snake #1's path to the upper-right quadrant. Look at him at (5, 3). If he tries to come up, we want to be there with a long body to wall him off! We\u2019re going to grab (5, 6) or (7, 7) next and just get BIG. Bigger snake = bigger hitbox = more chances for him to CRASH OUT into us! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nChat, we are playing for the HIGHLIGHT REEL! We\u2019re going to shadow his movements from the north and slowly squeeze the life out of his space.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Moving Right to (5, 7). Next turn, we look at (5, 6) or (6, 7). We stay above him and maintain the score lead to keep the pressure on. If he tries to head-butt us, we remind him who the Alpha Snake is!\n\nRIGHT",

The board is TIGHT!\n\n**1. Analyze Current Board State & Rival Position:**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5, 3). No body yet. Score 0. We're in a good lower-center position.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 0):** Head at (4, 7). Body segment at (4, 8). Score 1 (They got the first apple! We need to catch up!).\n\nLook how the opponent is set up! They are literally one move away from committing to either side of the board or coming down the center. Their tail is at (4, 8). They currently occupy (4, 7) and (4, 8).\n\n**2. What Did the Rival Do Last Turn? (Prediction Confirmation)**\n\nMy prediction was that Snake #0 would go DOWN to (4, 7) and eat the guaranteed apple there. Let's look at the current board state: Snake 0 is at (4, 7) with a body segment at (4, 8). This means Snake #0 moved from (4, 8) to (4, 7) and ate the apple! See how it works, Chat? We predicted their hunger! Now they have a short body and are a much bigger threat.\n\n**3. Strategic Goals for Turn 1:**\n\nWe need to start growing immediately while maintaining our strategic flank. The closest apples are to our right/down-right: (7, 3) and (6, 2). We must avoid collision in the center.\n\n**4. Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (5, 3):**\n\n*   **Board boundaries:** (0,0) to (9,9). We are at (5, 3).\n*   **UP to (5, 4):** Safe. Moves us toward the center.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 2):** Safe. Moves us towards the bottom and potentially (6, 2).\n*   **LEFT to (4, 3):** Safe. Moves us back to the center column.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 3):** Safe. Moves us towards (7, 3) and commits to the right side.\n\n**5. Predict Rival's (Snake 0 at 4, 7) Moves:**\n\nSnake #0 just ate, so they are probably looking for another apple or trying to establish dominance.\n\n*   **Apple Targets:** (7, 7), (1, 7), (2, 6), (5, 9).\n*   **DOWN to (4, 6):** Safe. Moves them down the center spine. Threatens to cut us off later.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 7):** Safe. Moves them toward (1, 7), (2, 6).\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 7):** Safe. Moves them toward (7, 7). *Crucially, this move brings them into Column 5, where we are!*\n*   **UP to (4, 8):** Safe. Moves them back to their tail position. Less likely since there's no apple there.\n\n**6. Tactical Decision for Snake 1:**\n\nThe opponent is at (4, 7). We are at (5, 3). If we move UP to (5, 4), we are moving closer to the opponent's likely path.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (5, 7), they are only three spaces above us.\n(5, 7)\n(5, 6)\n(5, 5)\n(5, 4) - If we went UP\n(5, 3) - Our current spot\n\nWe need to avoid the head-on engagement for now, as they are longer and have the score advantage. We need to secure growth on the right flank, just as planned!\n\n*   Moving **RIGHT to (6, 3):** This moves us directly towards the apple at (7, 3). It establishes our control on the right side and puts maximum distance between us and the opponent's likely descent down Column 4 or 5. This is 100% the safest and most aggressive growth-oriented move that avoids immediate conflict.\n\n*   Moving **DOWN to (5, 2):** Also good for growth (apple at 6, 2), but moving right feels like a stronger commitment to the upper quadrant of the board.\n\nLet's maintain the flanking maneuver. Commit to the right side and go for that (7, 3) apple. We are positioning ourselves to eventually cut across the bottom or middle of the board while the enemy is cornered up top.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue moving along the right flank to consume apples (7, 3) and (6, 2). Seek to reach the bottom boundary, grow to size 3-4, and then look to position ourselves under Snake #0, forcing them to turn inward or crash into a wall. We are going to establish a long body barrier! EZ W!\n\nRIGHT",

We are already bigger, stronger, and faster! Look at the board\u2014we just moved to (5, 7) and we are looking JUICY!\n\n**SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS:**\nOur Head: (5, 7). Our Body: [(4, 7)].\nRival Head: (6, 3). No body yet because he's a hungry scrub!\nApple Watch: (5, 6) is right below us! (6, 6) is just to the right of that! (7, 7) is to our right! We are surrounded by snacks, Chat! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4f\n\n**VIBE CHECK THE MOVES:**\n- **UP:** (5, 8). It's safe, but it moves us further away from the rival. We want to be the shadow in his nightmares, not a ghost in the north! \u274c\n- **LEFT:** (4, 7). NOOO! That's our own body behind us! We aren't throwing the lead on Turn 2! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 7). This is massive! It keeps us high, puts us next to the (7, 7) apple, and maintains our positioning to cut him off if he tries to push up the right side. \u27a1\ufe0f\n- **DOWN:** (5, 6). THE HUNGRY PLAY! Grab that apple, grow to size 3, and immediately put ourselves on a collision course with his lane. If we take (5, 6), we are 3 blocks away from his head at (6, 3). \u2b07\ufe0f\n\n**THE GAME PLAN:**\nChat, we are going **DOWN**. Why? Because we need that growth ASAP! Going to (5, 6) puts us at 2 apples. If he grabs an apple this turn, we're still ahead. If he doesn't, we're doubling his size! Once we hit size 3, we can start looping around the mid-board to create a wall he can't penetrate. We are playing AGGRESSIVE. We are playing for the WIN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Moving DOWN to (5, 6) to secure the 2nd apple. This expands our tail and makes us a bigger obstacle. Next, we look to pivot RIGHT toward (6, 6) or (7, 5) to keep the pressure on the bottom-right quadrant where he's lurking. If he moves UP, we face-tank him because we have the score lead!

Can we get a \"W\" in the chat for the victory dance we're about to do?\n\n**Current Board State Review (Turn 2)**\n\n*   **We are Snake 1 (ID 1):** Head at (6, 3). We just moved RIGHT. Score: 0. Short and fast, ready to strike!\n*   **Rival Snake 0 (ID 0):** Head at (5, 7). Body at (4, 7). Score: 1. They are threatening the mid-upper board.\n\nLook how close they moved to the center spine! They went from (4, 7) to (5, 7), eating an apple at (5, 7) or just moving there. Wait, let me check the board. Ah, the apple at (5, 7) was not there, but there was an apple at (5, 9) and (7, 7).\n\nLet's deduce the opponent's last move (from 4, 7).\n\n1.  If they went UP to (4, 8), their head would be at (4, 8), body (4, 7).\n2.  If they went RIGHT to (5, 7), their head would be at (5, 7), body (4, 7). **This is the current board state!** The opponent moved RIGHT! That apple near them must have been at (5, 7) based on our previous turn's prediction error, or more likely, they moved to (5, 7) purposefully to flank, and the apple at (7, 5) is slightly further. They are positioning aggressively!\n\nTheir body is short, and they are now on Column 5, right above us in Column 6. This is the moment of truth!\n\n(5, 7) - Opponent Head\n(6, 3) - Our Head\n\nDistance is small, but we are separated by four rows and one column.\n\n**1. Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (6, 3):**\n\n*   **UP to (6, 4):** Safe. Moves us toward the center spine and potentially closer to the enemy.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 2):** Safe. Directly onto an apple! POG! This is a high-priority move.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 3):** Safe. Retreats back to where we started last turn.\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Safe. Directly onto an apple! POG! Also a high-priority move.\n\nWe have a choice between two apples: (6, 2) [DOWN] and (7, 3) [RIGHT].\n\n**2. Predict Rival's (Snake 0 at 5, 7) Moves:**\n\nThey just came from (4, 7) and their body is at (4, 7). They are now at (5, 7).\n\n*   **Apple Targets:** (7, 7), (5, 9).\n*   **UP to (5, 8):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 9). Very likely.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Safe. Moves toward (7, 7). Very likely. This is a very aggressive move, putting them in Column 6, directly above us!\n*   **DOWN to (5, 6):** Safe. Moves them down the center. This is also a strong possibility if they want to block us later.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 7):** Moving into their own body is an instantly fatal move. **ELIMINATED!** (This is why we check that rule, Chat!)\n\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6, 7), they are only four spaces above us, in the same column:\n(6, 7) - Opponent Head (prediction)\n(6, 6) - Apple\n(6, 5)\n(6, 4) - If we went UP\n(6, 3) - Our Head\n\n**3. Tactical Decision: Growth vs. Conflict**\n\nWe have two guaranteed apples: RIGHT to (7, 3) or DOWN to (6, 2).\n\n*   **Option A: Go RIGHT to (7, 3) and eat.**\n    *   Pro: Guarantees a point and growth. Moves us further right, away from the enemy's aggressive central position. Sets us up nicely for future moves toward (7, 1) or (8, 2) or DOWN to (7, 2).\n*   **Option B: Go DOWN to (6, 2) and eat.**\n    *   Pro: Guarantees a point and growth. Commits us to the bottom half of the board.\n    *   Con: If the enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 7), they are now positioned to drop down Column 6 and cut us off, potentially blocking us into the (6, 0) area.\n\nSince they are aggressive and now occupy (5, 7) and are threatening to move into (6, 7), we must clear out of Column 6 ASAP to avoid getting pinned against the wall. Moving **RIGHT** is the flanking maneuver we planned! It puts us at (7, 3) and forces the opponent to chase us across the board or commit to the far left.\n\nWe need to secure the advantage through score immediately, before they grow too long.\n\n**Strategic Flanking Plan:**\n1.  Move RIGHT to (7, 3) and eat. Score 1.\n2.  Next turn, move DOWN or continue RIGHT to secure more territory and clear apples (7, 1), (8, 2).\n3.  Let the opponent waste time trying to control the center. We will grow massive on the right flank, then cut across the board when we are longer.\n\nThis is a clean, aggressive, and safe move. Let's get this apple and secure the lead!\n\nRIGHT",

They are longer, so a direct head-on collision is currently *not* in our favor, but we must start boxing them. They are currently isolating the left side of the board for themselves. We must dominate this right quadrant.\n\n**1. Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (7, 3):**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 4):** Safe. Moves us toward an apple at (7, 5).\n*   **DOWN to (7, 2):** Safe. Moves us toward an apple at (7, 1).\n*   **LEFT to (6, 3):** Into our own body (tail location). **FATAL! ELIMINATED!** (Never move backwards, Chat!)\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 3):** Safe. Keeps us along the Row 3 path, maybe aiming for (8, 2).\n\nAll three safe moves lead to good apple prospects. This is great board state.\n\n**2. Predict Rival's (Snake 0 at 5, 6) Moves:**\n\nThey have body at [(5, 7), (4, 7)]. They are centralized and moving South.\n\n*   **Apple Targets:** (6, 6), (2, 6), (7, 5).\n*   **UP to (5, 7):** Moving into their own body (tail location). **FATAL! ELIMINATED!**\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe. Continues their drop down the center, possibly aiming for the bottom row.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the next apple at (2, 6).\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe. DIRECTLY onto an apple at (6, 6)! This is the most likely move. They get another point and block off Column 6.\n\nIf the opponent moves RIGHT to (6, 6), their head is at (6, 6).\n\n**3. Tactical Decision: Aggressive Expansion and Flanking**\n\nWe are at (7, 3).

It also puts us closer to the opponent's anticipated location (6, 6). If we move RIGHT next turn, we can hug the right wall and continue to grow.\n    *   Con: We could be setting ourselves up for a conflict two turns out, but we are too short to fight them yet.\n\n*   **Option B: Go DOWN to (7, 2).**\n    *   Pro: Sets us up to quickly grab (7, 1) and then (8, 2). A sequence of DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN could secure three apples quickly.\n    *   Con: Moves us away from the enemy. They might get too much central control.\n\n*   **Option C: Go RIGHT to (8, 3).**\n    *   Pro: Expands our territory along the bottom-right fence, setting up for (8, 2). Provides maximum distance from the aggressive center.\n    *   Con: Slows our path to the nearest apples at (7, 1) and (7, 5).\n\nThe enemy is already aggressive and cutting the board in half. If they go to (6, 6), they are closing the gap on us from above. We need to claim our territory NOW and grow long before we engage.\n\nThe most efficient growth path is to secure the vertical column 7 and 8 apples.\n\nLet's capitalize on the vertical alignment we have now. Moving **UP** to (7, 4) targets (7, 5). If we get (7, 5), we can then decide to go RIGHT for (7, 7) or DOWN the wall. This keeps us flexible and threatens the rival's top-right apples.\n\nIf the opponent moves to (6, 6), we must not let them easily cut us off. By moving UP, we are making a bid for the upper center, threatening a collision if they dare drop down column 6 *or* if they try to move further right. We are playing chicken, but safely!\n\n**Future Plan (Long Term Strategy Note):** We are establishing firm control over the eastern side of the board (Columns 7, 8, 9). We will grow to length 5 or 6, then pivot inward (LEFT) to cut off Snake #0, who is committing to the center and left side. We need to be longer than them before initiating the choke-hold.\n\nUP",

He\u2019s size 2. He is tiny! He is weak! He is shaking in his scales!\n- **Score:** 3 to 1. We have the mass advantage. If we collide heads, WE WIN THE GAME immediately because we have more apples! That is a pro-gamer move right there!\n\n**VIBE CHECK THE MOVES:**\n- **UP:** (6, 7). Safe? No, wait! (5, 7) is our body, but (6, 7) is empty. However, it puts us closer to our own tail. \n- **LEFT:** (5, 6). BACKWARDS! That\u2019s an instant RIP. We don't throw for the memes, Chat! \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (7, 6). This is aggressive! It moves us right above his head. If he moves UP to (7, 5), we are staring him down. \n- **DOWN:** (6, 5). This is the move, Chat! Look at the board. If we go DOWN to (6, 5), we are cutting off his path to the left. We are positioning ourselves to \"The Coil.\" \n\n**THE GAME PLAN:**\nWe are going **DOWN**. Why? Because (6, 5) puts us in a prime position to intercept him. He\u2019s at (7, 4). If he tries to go for the apple at (7, 5), we are right there next to him at (6, 5). If he tries to run away toward the center, we are blocking his path! \n\nBy moving DOWN, we stay flexible. We can then pivot RIGHT to squeeze him against the wall or stay in the center to dominate all the apple spawns. We are playing 4D Chess while he's playing Checkers! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25 If he's brave enough to move into (6, 5) at the same time as us? HEAD-ON COLLISION! We have 3 apples, he has 1. WE WIN THE GAME ON THE SPOT! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Moving DOWN to (6, 5) to initiate the \"Box-In.\" We are bigger, we are faster, and we own the center-right of the board.

We gotta turn this around, or we're going to get boxed in and taken out! Can I get some \"POWER UP\" emotes in the chat?!\n\n**Current Situation Review (Turn 4)**\n\n*   **We are Snake 1 (ID 1):** Head at (7, 4). Body at [(7, 3)]. Length 2. Score: 1.\n*   **Rival Snake 0 (ID 0):** Head at (6, 6). Body at [(5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7)]. Length 4. Score: 3. They are $2\\times$ our length! This is a dangerous gap.\n\nRival's Last Move deduction: They were at (5, 6) with body [(5, 7), (4, 7)]. They clearly moved **RIGHT** to (6, 6) and collected an apple! Smart, aggressive move. They are now officially dominating the center and are positioned to cut us off from the top of the board.\n\n**Board State for Tactical Analysis:**\n|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 9 | A | . | . | . | . | . | A | . | . | . |\n| 8 | A | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | A | . |\n| 7 | . | A | . | . | . | T | T | A | . | . |\n| 6 | . | . | A | . | . | T | 0 | . | . | . |\n| 5 | . | . | . | . | . | T | . | A | . | A |\n| 4 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | 1 | . | . |\n| 3 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | T | . | . |\n| 2 | . | . | A | . | . | . | A | . | A | . |\n| 1 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | A | . | . |\n| 0 | . | A | A | A | . | . | . | . | . | . |\n\n**Our Objective:** We MUST grow IMMEDIATELY. Our priority is the apple at (7, 5) or expanding into (8, 4) to open up (9, 5) and (8, 2) on the right flank. We cannot afford to be trapped on the right wall by column 6. The enemy must not be allowed to drop down onto us.\n\n**1. Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (7, 4):**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 5):** Lands on an apple! **MASSIVE WIN!** This is safe!\n*   **DOWN to (7, 3):** Into our own body (tail location). **FATAL! ELIMINATED!** (Never move backwards, Chat!)\n*   **LEFT to (6, 4):** Safe. Moves us toward the center, but right next to the opponent's body (5, 6).\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 4):** Safe. Expands along the right edge, aiming for (9, 5) and (8, 2).\n\nWe have an immediate apple grab at (7, 5). This is the highest priority move! A guaranteed score and length increase is exactly what we need when the opponent is longer.\n\n**2. Predict Rival's (Snake 0 at 6, 6) Moves:**\n\nThey have body at [(5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7)]. They are long and aggressive.\n\n*   **Apple Targets:** (6, 2), (2, 6), (7, 7). The apple at $(7, 7)$ is the closest big target for them.\n*   **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. Moves directly toward the apple at (7, 7) or (6, 9). This is likely.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 5):** Safe. Puts them right on the edge of cutting us off from the center, and they might aim for (6, 2). Highly plausible aggressive move.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 6):** Into their own body (tail location). **FATAL! ELIMINATED!**\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Safe. Moving toward (7, 7). This is also very likely.\n\nIf they prioritize the upper board, they will go UP to (6, 7) or RIGHT to (7, 6).\n\nIf we move UP to (7, 5), we grab the apple. Our head is now (7, 5).\n\n*   If they move UP to (6, 7), they are nearby, but we are safe.\n*   If they move RIGHT to (7, 6), we are safe, separated by one diagonal space (7, 5) vs (7, 6).\n*   If they move DOWN to (6, 5), they are moving to block the center, but we are still safe.\n\nThe move UP to (7, 5) is safe regardless of the opponent's move and guarantees crucial growth. This is the optimal tactical move for Turn 4.\n\n**3. Long-Term Strategy: Secure the Right, Prepare the Choke**\n\nWe are committed to the right quadrant. If we hit the apple at (7, 5), we grow to length 3. Next turn, we must decide:\n1. Continue UP to (7, 6) or (7, 7) to contest the opponent's top-right expansion, or\n2. Move RIGHT to (8, 5) to expand our territory toward the edge and apples (9, 5) and (8, 8).\n\nSince the enemy is so long, we must get to at least length 5 before we consider turning LEFT across the board, or they will swallow us whole. Our immediate plan is to hit (7, 5), and then exploit the upper-right corner as quickly as possible. We need to secure (7, 7) and (8, 8).\n\nWe are going for the guaranteed content and growth! Let's GO!\n\nUP",

Puts us one square away from a possible head-to-head collision if Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (7, 6).\n*   **DOWN to (7, 4):** Into our own body. **FATAL!**\n*   **LEFT to (6, 5):** **HEAD-ON COLLISION (potential)!** Snake 0 is at (6, 5). If we both move here, both die! Since Snake 0 just moved DOWN to (6, 5), they are very unlikely to move onto their own body space, but moving LEFT takes us to (6, 5) which is their CURRENT head position. If they move *away* (e.g., UP or DOWN or RIGHT to 7, 5), this is safe, but since heads move simultaneously, this is a **MASSIVE RISK**. If they stay, we crash! We must assume they will move. But moving into their current spot is extremely dangerous and rarely a good move unless calculating a specific head-on collision advantage (which we don't have). **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Safe. Expands our territory along the top edge, aiming for (9, 5) and (8, 8). Maintains distance from the rival.\n\n**2. Predict Rival's (Snake 0 at 6, 5) Moves:**\n\nThey have body at [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]. They just moved aggressively to deny the middle.\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 6):** Into their own body. **FATAL!**\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 4):** Safe. Puts them closer to the (6, 2) apple and denies us the move below them. Highly likely aggressive move.\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 5):** Safe. Expands to the left.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 5):** **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** They move to **our current spot!** We are at (7, 5); if they move here, this is not a crash unless we move elsewhere. They see us on the right, and might try to block us by moving RIGHT.\n\n**Risk Assessment for Our Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (7, 6):**\n    *   If Snake 0 goes DOWN (6, 4): We are safe and continue growing vertically. Good.\n    *   If Snake 0 goes LEFT (5, 5): We are safe and gain ground. Good.\n    *   If Snake 0 goes RIGHT (7, 5): Not possible (that's our current spot, which is empty when we move).\n    *   If Snake 0 goes RIGHT to (7, 6) from (6, 5)? No, that's two spaces. Wait, I misread coordinates. Snake 0 is at (6, 5). A move RIGHT is to (7, 5) - our current head location. Since we move simultaneously, if they go RIGHT to (7, 5) and we go UP to (7, 6), the move is safe for both. Win!\n    *   If we go UP, we are directly aiming for the apple at (7, 7). This feels like the most direct path to growth.\n\n*   **Option B: RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n    *   If Snake 0 goes DOWN (6, 4): We are safe and expand territory. Good.\n    *   If Snake 0 goes LEFT (5, 5): We are safe and gain space. Good.\n    *   If Snake 0 goes RIGHT (7, 5): This is Snake 0 moving into the space we are *leaving*. This is a massive spatial win for them, as they are now one step closer to us and our right-side expansion. This might delay our conflict but gives them control.\n\n**The Power Play:**\n\nWe are committed to the right wall. The apple at (7, 7) is critical. If we let them get to it first, they will be long enough to lock down the entire top half of the board.\n\nIf we move **UP to (7, 6)**, we put ourselves on the direct line to (7, 7).\nIf Snake 0 goes DOWN to (6, 4), we have separated ourselves vertically, which is good.\nIf Snake 0 goes LEFT to (5, 5), we continue to dominate the boundary space.\nIf Snake 0 attempts to challenge us by moving RIGHT to (7, 5) (the square we just occupied), they are still far from (7, 7).\n\nWe need to keep the pressure on. Moving UP is aggressive, safe, and targets a crucial apple. We cannot let them solidify their position in the center (column 6) without contesting the space above them.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:** Secure (7, 7) and then push RIGHT to (8, 8) or (9, 9) to utilize the full board space. The goal is to reach length 5 and then use that length to trap Snake 0 against the left wall or the bottom wall. Right now, vertical movement UP is key.\n\nLet's go UP and snag that high-value target! Get ready for the next growth spurt, CHAT!\n\nUP",
