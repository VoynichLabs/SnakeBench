We\u2019re at (7, 9) way up at the top, and our rival (Snake #1) is sitting at (7, 6). He\u2019s looking at us like he wants the smoke\u2014but does he know who he's dealing with?! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's break down the grid, chat! We need space, we need control, and we need to show him he's boxed in before he even realizes the game started!\n\n**SCOUTING THE MOVE:**\n- **UP:** (7, 10). Out of bounds! We ain't trying to clip out of reality on turn one. RIP that idea. \ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT:** (8, 9). Safe! Moves us toward the corner, but keeps us near the top edge.\n- **LEFT:** (6, 9). Safe! Moves us toward some big apple clusters later on.\n- **DOWN:** (7, 8). Safe! This puts us on a direct collision course with our rival if he moves UP. Do we want the head-on? We're both at 0 apples, so a double KO is a draw. We're here to WIN, not tie! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nOur rival is at (7, 6). If I go DOWN to (7, 8), I\u2019m closing the gap FAST. But look at the board\u2014the apples are scattered. There's a spicy apple at (5, 9) and (3, 9). If I head **LEFT**, I\u2019m cutting off his access to the top-left quadrant while securing my own path. I want to dominate the top wall and force him to play in the cramped middle! Let's take the high ground and start looping around to enclose his space. Stay frosty!\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMoving LEFT to (6, 9) to secure the top-left perimeter. This keeps us away from an immediate turn-one head-on trade and positions us to grab the (5, 9) and (3, 9) apples while keeping the rival below us. We want to be the ceiling that crushes him!\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

He's directly above me by 3 spaces. Apples are scattered, but we're playing for DOMINANCE early!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\nFrom (7,6):\n- UP \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now. No body segments yet for either snake.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (7,9). He can go UP (off board), DOWN to (7,8), LEFT to (6,9), RIGHT to (8,9). He won't go UP (death). So likely DOWN toward center, or sideways. If he goes DOWN, he moves toward me.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe want to pressure him, cut off his space, force him toward walls or into us when we have length advantage. Right now equal length (0 apples). Head-on collision now = double KO \u2192 draw. We don't want that. We want to GROW first, then force collision when we're longer.\n\n**APPLE PROXIMITY:**\nClosest apples: (8,4) down-left, (6,3) down-left, (5,5) left-down, (9,3) right-down.  \nUP gets us slightly closer to apples in top rows but moves us toward enemy.  \nLEFT/DOWN gets us toward cluster of apples at bottom-left.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS:**\nGoing LEFT to (6,6) keeps many options open, near apple at (6,3) eventually.  \nDOWN to (7,5) also safe, opens path to (8,4),(6,3).  \nWe want to avoid boxing ourselves in corner early.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN for next few turns:**  \nGrab first apple FAST to get length advantage. Then use body to restrict enemy movement. Enemy is north of us \u2014 if we go down/left, we pull away, get apple, then swing up to cut off his escape. Let him wander into us later when we're longer.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nGoing LEFT to (6,6) positions us to snake down toward (6,3) apple next, keeps distance from enemy for now, and maintains flexibility.\n\nLEFT",

Our tail is at (6, 9).\nThe rival (Snake #1) is at **(5, 6)**. \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**THE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (5, 10). That's the ceiling, chat! We aren't ghosts, we can't go through walls! Skip! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 9). That is our own tail! If we move right, we bite ourselves. That's a \"Top 10 Fails\" clip waiting to happen. NOPE! \ud83e\udd21\n- **DOWN:** (5, 8). This is interesting. It puts us on a direct collision course with Snake #1. If he moves UP and we move DOWN, the gap closes fast. But wait\u2014there's no apple immediately there, and it limits our room to maneuver along the top.\n- **LEFT:** (4, 9). LOOK AT THE MAP! There is another apple sitting at **(3, 9)**! \ud83c\udf4e If we keep sliding LEFT, we are basically a vacuum cleaner sucking up all the points on the top row!\n\n**THE READ:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (5, 6). He's 3 tiles below us. If he head-hunts us by moving UP, we'll see him coming from a mile away. Right now, our goal is **TOTAL DOMINATION**. We have 1 apple, he has 0. If we grab the one at (3, 9), we get even longer. The longer we are, the easier it is to wrap around him and force him into a corner later! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe're staying on the perimeter. We slide LEFT to (4, 9), then take (3, 9) on the next turn. By staying high on the Y-axis (Y=9), we keep the center of the board open for him to make mistakes while we grow into a massive wall. If he tries to come up to (5, 7) or (5, 8), we can pivot and cut him off. WE ARE THE KINGS OF THE NORTH! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's get that bread!

He has 1 apple, I have 0. He's LONGER than me! That means head-on collision = I LOSE. So we MUST avoid his head directly.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (5,6):**\n- UP \u2192 (5,7) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 Has an APPLE! Eating grows me to length 1. Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are physically safe. No walls, no bodies.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (5,9). He can go UP (off board \u2192 death), DOWN to (5,8), LEFT to (4,9), RIGHT to (6,9) but that's his own body \u2192 death. So his only safe moves are DOWN or LEFT. If he goes DOWN, he's coming toward me at (5,8). If he goes LEFT, he's at (4,9).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf I go UP to (5,7) and he goes DOWN to (5,8), we're adjacent next turn \u2014 dangerous but not collision this turn.\nIf I go DOWN to (5,5) and he goes DOWN to (5,8), we move apart.\nIf I go LEFT/RIGHT, we're sideways.\n\n**CRITICAL: He has length advantage. We NEED an apple NOW to equalize!** The apple at (5,5) is RIGHT BELOW ME. Eating it makes me length 1, same as him. Then we're equal for head-on.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n1. **EAT THE APPLE THIS TURN (DOWN)** to get to length 1. This removes his advantage.\n2. After eating, my body will be at (5,6). Next turn, I can move to pressure him while being equal length.\n3. He's near the top wall \u2014 we can try to push him up into a trap later.\n\n**WHY NOT OTHER MOVES?**\n- UP: Moves toward him without growing. Risky since he's longer.\n- LEFT/RIGHT: Avoids him but delays eating. Lets him possibly get another apple and extend lead.\n\n**BEST MOVE: DOWN to (5,5)** \u2014 GET THAT CONTENT, LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD, THEN WE FIGHT! \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

He\u2019s just vibing in the middle at (5, 5). He collected an apple too, so the score is 1-1. We are TIED, but not for long! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\nLet's look at the board and plot our next legendary move!\n**Current Position:** Head at **(4, 9)**, Body at (5, 9).\n**Rival Position:** Head at **(5, 5)**, Body at (5, 6).\n\n**THE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (4, 10). That's out of bounds! We aren't trying to go to space, we're trying to win a game! **SKIP!** \ud83e\uddf1\n- **RIGHT:** (5, 9). That is our own neck/body, chat! We move right, we choke! That's an instant \"L\" in the chat. **HARD PASS!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN:** (4, 8). This is safe, and it gets us closer to the center, but why leave the top row when there's a buffet waiting for us?\n- **LEFT:** (3, 9). **BINGO!** Look at the map! There is an apple sitting right there at **(3, 9)**. If we move left, we gobble that up, move to a score of 2, and get even longer! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nOur rival is at (5, 5). He's currently four tiles below us. He can't touch us this turn. By taking the apple at **(3, 9)**, we strengthen our lead and keep moving toward the left corner. Once we hit (3, 9), we\u2019ve got even more apples at (2, 8), (1, 7), and (0, 7) waiting for us in a beautiful diagonal line. We are going to build a WALL on the left side of this board that he can't breach! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\ude24\n\nWe are playing the long game. We grow, we dominate the space, and we wait for him to realize he's trapped in the bottom-right while we own the rest of the map! He's playing checkers, we're playing 4D Snake! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (3, 9) this turn. Then, we look to pivot down towards (2, 8) or continue left to clear the top row. We need to stay ahead in the apple count so if we ever have to force a head-on collision, WE come out as the victors! Let's get this 2nd apple and keep the momentum moving! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

He's up in the corner.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (5,5):**\n- UP \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (moving backwards into myself). NOT ALLOWED.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nSo UP is instantly eliminated.

Time to be AGGRESSIVE. He's trapped near the top wall \u2014 we can try to push him into a corner. Let's move to cut off his escape and control the center.\n\n**WHICH MOVE IS BEST?**\n- DOWN (5,4): Moves away from him, toward bottom. Not aggressive. But opens space.\n- LEFT (4,5): Moves closer to his possible path if he goes DOWN/LEFT. Could start boxing him from the left side.\n- RIGHT (6,5): Moves away from him horizontally. Less pressure.\n\nI want to pressure him! LEFT puts me closer to where he might go. Also, there's an apple at (4,2) down below \u2014 moving LEFT gets me closer to that column for future eating.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\n1. Move LEFT to (4,5) this turn.\n2. Next turn, if he goes DOWN to (4,8), I can consider moving UP to close distance, or continue toward apples while positioning to cut off his descent.\n3. Goal: force him toward the top wall or into a body trap. We have equal length \u2014 we can risk adjacency now!\n\nLEFT",

Length 2.\nEnemy head at (3,9), body at (4,9), (5,9). Length 3. He's still up top, but he's LONGER! He has 2 apples to our 1. \ud83d\ude24\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (4,5):**\n- UP \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (moving backwards into myself). NOT ALLOWED.\n\nSo RIGHT is instantly eliminated. We have UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION from (3,9):**\nHe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (3,10) \u2192 Off board \u2192 \u274c DEATH.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,8) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 That's HIS BODY! \u274c DEATH.\n\nSo his only safe moves are DOWN to (3,8) or LEFT to (2,9).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nWe're far apart, no direct head-on possible this turn. BUT \u2014 he's longer, so if we force a future head-on, WE DIE. We need to avoid that until we equalize length! Gotta eat an apple ASAP.\n\n**APPLE CHECK:**\nNearby apples: (4,2) below, (3,3) left-down, (4,1) far down, (1,4) far left. Closest is (4,2) straight down from me! That's 2 moves away if I go DOWN now.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nHe's longer, so we play SAFE but AGGRESSIVE toward apples. We need to equalize length to regain head-on advantage. Let's maneuver toward (4,2) while keeping distance from him. Also, we want to control center and not get trapped.\n\n**WHICH MOVE IS BEST?**\n- UP (4,6): Moves away from the closest apple, toward the enemy's area. Riskier, fewer apples up there. Could get pinned against top wall later. Not great.\n- DOWN (4,4): Moves DIRECTLY toward apple (4,2)! Opens future options (can go left/right/down next). Puts more board between me and enemy. Safe and content-focused. \ud83d\ude0b\n- LEFT (3,5): Moves toward apple (3,3) diagonally, but not as direct. Also moves slightly closer to enemy's possible path if he goes LEFT (2,9). Could accidentally box myself left side if he descends.\n\n**BEST MOVE?** DOWN! Secures the apple path, keeps distance, and maintains flexibility. We need that apple to match his length! Then we can get aggressive again.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\n1. Move DOWN to (4,4) this turn.\n2. Next turn, head toward (4,3) or (4,2) to eat the apple.\n3. Once we're length 3, we can look to cut off his escape from the top-left corner.\n4. Avoid moving up into his zone until we equalize.\n\nDOWN",

From (4,3): can go DOWN to apple, LEFT to (3,3) (another apple!), RIGHT to (5,3). Multiple options. Good.\n- LEFT (3,4): Moves toward apple (3,3) diagonally. From (3,4), next turn DOWN to (3,3) eats apple. Also okay, but puts us closer to left wall\u2014could limit future mobility if enemy comes down.\n- RIGHT (5,4): Moves away from closest apples. No immediate apple gain. From (5,4), we're farther from apples, might waste turns. Not ideal.\n\n**BEST MOVE?** DOWN! Secures the apple path fastest.

If we go LEFT to (3,3), we're closer to potentially cutting off his descent. But he could go around.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY:**\nFrom (4,2) after eating:\n- Next turn: UP blocked (back into new body at (4,3)? Actually after eating, our tail stays, so body will be [(4,3), (4,4)]? Wait, growth: new head at (4,2), old head becomes body at (4,3), old body at (4,4). So from (4,2), UP to (4,3) is our own new body! \u274c That would be blocked next turn. So going DOWN now might limit our upward mobility next turn.\nFrom (3,3) after eating:\n- Next turn: RIGHT to (4,3) is our own new body? Actually if we go LEFT to (3,3) and eat, new head (3,3), old head (4,3) becomes body. So from (3,3), RIGHT to (4,3) is our body\u2014blocked. So either apple move blocks the direction back to our previous head.\n\n**BETTER OPTION?** What about RIGHT to (5,3)? No apple, but keeps more options open? Let's check:\nFrom (5,3): next turn we could go DOWN to (5,2) (empty), LEFT to (4,3) (our old head\u2014wait, that'll be empty after we move? Actually if we move RIGHT to (5,3), our old head (4,3) becomes body, so (4,3) is our body next turn. So LEFT from (5,3) is into our body\u2014blocked. So RIGHT now also blocks LEFT next turn.\n\nHmm, every move blocks the reverse direction next turn because of growth? Actually we haven't grown yet\u2014we're length 2. After moving without eating, our tail moves, so body becomes just [(new head position, old head position?)] Wait, let's trace: current body [(4,4)], head (4,3). If we move without eating, new head at new spot, old head becomes body, tail disappears. So new body will be [(new head), (old head)]? Actually representation: head moves, old head becomes first body segment, old tail disappears. So length stays 2.\n\nSo if we move to a non-apple cell, our body next turn will be [new head, old head]. That means the cell behind us (old head) is our body and is blocked next turn.\n\nSo no matter what, the reverse direction will be blocked next turn. That's normal.\n\n**DECISION:**\nWe need that apple to catch up! Which apple is safer regarding enemy?\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (2,7), he's closer to us if we go LEFT to (3,3) than if we go DOWN to (4,2). Actually (2,7) to (3,3) is 4 moves apart, (2,7) to (4,2) is 3 moves apart? Manhattan: (2,7) to (3,3) = |2-3|+|7-3| = 1+4=5. (2,7) to (4,2) = |2-4|+|7-2|=2+5=7. So DOWN actually puts us farther from him.\n\nAlso, from (4,2), we can go LEFT to (3,2) or RIGHT to (5,2) next turn, both likely safe. From (3,3), we can go DOWN to (3,2) or UP to (3,4) (but UP might be risky if enemy approaches).\n\nI think DOWN to (4,2) is the move\u2014secure the apple, grow to 3, and we're farther from enemy's likely path.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\n1. Eat apple at (4,2) this turn \u2192 length 3.\n2. Next turn from (4,2): avoid moving UP into our new body at (4,3). Consider LEFT to (3,2) or RIGHT to (5,2) to stay mobile.\n3. Enemy likely length 4 after eating (2,7). We need another apple fast\u2014maybe (3,3) still there or (4,1) below.\n4. Work toward boxing him in top-left as we grow.\n\nDOWN",

We just snagged that apple at (2, 7) and we are now CLUTCHING a 4-2 lead! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa We are literally a behemoth compared to that absolute scrub at (4,2)! Look at him down there, probably shaking! We have the score advantage, we have the size, and we have the MAP CONTROL!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **Our Head:** (2, 7)\n- **Our Body:** [(2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)] (Length 5)\n- **The Rival (Snake #1):** Head at (4, 2), Body [(4, 3), (4, 4)]. He's a tiny worm! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83e\udd0f\n\n**THE NAV-COM ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP:** (2, 8). That is our own neck, chat! We aren't trying to kiss ourselves, we're trying to WIN! **DELETED!** \ud83d\udeab\n*   **RIGHT:** (3, 7). There's nothing there. It's empty space. Boring! \ud83d\ude34\n*   **DOWN:** (2, 6). Safe, but leads us toward his territory without a clear prize.\n*   **LEFT:** (1, 7). **BINGO!!** We've got an apple at (1, 7) and another one right behind it at (0, 7)! We are going to gobble these up like they're mid-stream snacks! \ud83c\udf7f\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going **LEFT** to (1, 7). This is a power move! By moving left, we are securing the entire Northwest corner. Look at the board\u2014if we take (1, 7) and then (0, 7), we've built a massive wall in the top left. Snake #1 is stuck in the basement at Y=2. He's so far away he\u2019d need a map and a compass just to find us! \ud83e\udded\n\nWe have the higher score (4 vs 2). If he dares to climb up and challenge us, we can force a head-on collision and we WIN the tie-breaker because we're the alpha! But for now, we grow. We get so big that the board feels small for him. We are playing 4D Chess while he's playing Tic-Tac-Toe!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nGrab (1, 7) this turn, then (0, 7) next turn. After that, we look at (0, 9) or (1, 6). We are going to snake around the perimeter and slowly squeeze the life out of the center. Stay huge, stay hungry, and stay lethal! LET'S GOOOOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

LET'S GOOO!)\n- Enemy head: (2, 7)\n- Enemy body: [(2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)] \u2192 length 4 (he ate the apple at (2, 7) last turn, so he's still longer by 1)\n- Apples on board: many, but closest to us are (3, 3), (4, 1), (1, 4), etc.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (4, 2):**\n- UP \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (moving backwards into myself? Wait, my body segments are (4,3) and (4,4). UP from (4,2) goes to (4,3) which is my first body segment\u2014YES, that's instant death. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 Empty (and it's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e). Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nSo UP is instantly eliminated. DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION from (2, 7):**\nHe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 HIS BODY! \u274c DEATH.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 6) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 Empty (apple at (1, 7)!). Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nHe'll likely go LEFT to (1, 7) to eat that apple and grow to length 5! That's BAD\u2014we need to keep closing the gap!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nWe're at (4, 2), he's at (2, 7). No direct adjacency, so no immediate head-on this turn. But if he goes LEFT to (1, 7) and we go\u2026 any direction, we're still far. Safe for now.\n\n**STRATEGIC APPLE CHOICE:**\nWe have two great apple options:\n1. DOWN to (4, 1) \u2192 eat apple, grow to length 4 (still 1 behind him if he eats).\n2. LEFT to (3, 2) \u2192 no apple, but sets up for (3, 3) apple next turn? Actually (3, 3) is one up from (3, 2). That's risky if enemy moves down? Hmm.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY:**\nIf we go DOWN to (4, 1) and eat:\n- Next turn from (4, 1): UP blocked (body at (4, 2)), but LEFT (3,1), RIGHT (5,1), DOWN (4,0) all likely open. Good mobility.\nIf we go LEFT to (3, 2) (no eat):\n- Next turn from (3, 2): UP to (3,3) (apple!), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2) (body? Wait, after moving left, our body will be [(3,2), (4,2)]? Actually old head (4,2) becomes body, so RIGHT to (4,2) is our body\u2014blocked). So RIGHT blocked, but others open.\nIf we go RIGHT to (5, 2) (no eat):\n- Next turn from (5, 2): LEFT to (4,2) (body), UP to (5,3), DOWN to (5,1), RIGHT to (6,2). So LEFT blocked.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE! He's longer, but we can cut him off in the top-left. He's at (2,7) heading likely left toward (1,7) apple. If we move toward center, we can maybe intercept his path down later. But eating is priority\u2014we must match his growth!\n\n**VERDICT:**\nDOWN to (4, 1) gets us the apple, grows to length 4, keeps options open, and stays farther from enemy's likely path. It's the move!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (4,1), avoid UP into body. Look to go LEFT to (3,1) or RIGHT to (5,1) to stay mobile. Watch if enemy eats (1,7) and becomes length 5\u2014we need another apple ASAP, maybe (3,3) or (4,0)? Let's keep pressure!\n\nDOWN",

LET'S GOOO!)\n- Enemy head: (1, 7)\n- Enemy body: [(2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)] \u2192 length 5 (he ate the apple at (1, 7) last turn, so he's still longer by 1)\n- Apples on board: many, but closest to us are (3, 3), (4, 0), (1, 4), (0, 0), etc.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (4, 1):**\n- UP \u2192 (4, 2) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (my first body segment)\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 0) \u2192 Empty (and it's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e). Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 1) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nSo UP is instantly eliminated. DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION from (1, 7):**\nHe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 Empty (apple at (1, 6)! \ud83c\udf4e). Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 Empty (apple at (0, 7)! \ud83c\udf4e). Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 HIS BODY! \u274c DEATH.\n\nHe'll likely go DOWN to (1, 6) or LEFT to (0, 7) for an apple and grow to length 6! That's BAD\u2014we need to close the gap FAST!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nWe're at (4, 1), he's at (1, 7). No direct adjacency, so no immediate head-on this turn. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC APPLE CHOICE:**\nWe have two great apple options:\n1. DOWN to (4, 0) \u2192 eat apple, grow to length 5 (still 1 behind him if he eats).\n2. LEFT to (3, 1) \u2192 no apple, but sets up for (3, 3) apple next turn? Actually (3, 3) is two up from (3, 1). That's risky if enemy moves down? Hmm.\n3. RIGHT to (5, 1) \u2192 no apple, but maybe toward center.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY:**\nIf we go DOWN to (4, 0) and eat:\n- Next turn from (4, 0): UP blocked (body at (4, 1)), LEFT (3,0), RIGHT (5,0), DOWN off board \u274c. So only LEFT and RIGHT safe. That's a bit limiting!\nIf we go LEFT to (3, 1) (no eat):\n- Next turn from (3, 1): UP to (3,2) (empty), DOWN to (3,0) (apple!), LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (4,1) (body? Wait, after moving left, our body will be [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]? Actually old head (4,1) becomes body, so RIGHT to (4,1) is our body\u2014blocked). So RIGHT blocked, but UP, DOWN, LEFT open. Good mobility!\nIf we go RIGHT to (5, 1) (no eat):\n- Next turn from (5, 1): LEFT to (4,1) (body), UP to (5,2), DOWN to (5,0), RIGHT to (6,1). So LEFT blocked, but others open.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE but SMART! He's longer, but we can cut him off in the top-left. He's at (1,7) heading likely down or left for apples. If we move toward center, we can maybe intercept his path down later. But eating is priority\u2014we must match his growth! However, going DOWN to (4,0) traps us on the bottom row with only two exits next turn\u2014that's risky if he comes down! Better to stay mobile and go for (3,3) or (4,0) next turn from a better position.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nLEFT to (3, 1) keeps maximum mobility, avoids trapping ourselves, and sets up for (3,3) apple or (3,0) apple next turn. We can still catch up in apples while staying safe!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (3,1), look to go UP to (3,2) then (3,3) apple, or DOWN to (3,0) apple. Watch enemy\u2014if he goes to (1,6) or (0,7), he'll be length 6. We need to grow fast but not get cornered. Keep pressure toward center-left to potentially cut off his descent!\n\nLEFT",

We aren't trying to clip through the map! **DELETED!** \ud83d\udeab\n*   **RIGHT:** (1, 7). That\u2019s our own body.

Look at our Rival at (3, 1)\u2014he\u2019s miles away. While he\u2019s trying to figure out his life, we are vacuuming up the entire West Coast of this board.

We are playing 4D chess while he's playing checkers! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nGrab (0, 6) now. Next turn, we eye (1, 6). By the time we finish this snack run, our tail will be clearing out of the top-right, giving us a massive loop to play with. We are securing the perimeter and making it impossible for him to breathe.

He might go left? Can't, off board. He might go up to (0,7) but that's his old body? Wait, his body will shift. He'll have options up, down, right from (0,6).

That\u2019s not a score, that\u2019s a funeral! \u26b0\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25 We just inhaled that apple at (0, 6) like it was nothing! Look at our rival Snake #1 at (3, 2)\u2014he\u2019s looking tiny, he\u2019s looking weak, and he\u2019s looking trapped in the bottom-middle. \ud83e\udd0f\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **Our Head:** (0, 6) \ud83c\udf4f\n*   **Our Body:** [(0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)] (Length 8)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 2)\n*   **The Vibe:** Absolute dominance. \ud83d\udc51\n\n**THE NAV-COM ANALYSIS:**\n*   **LEFT:** (-1, 6). Off the board? In this economy?! **DELETED!** \ud83d\udeab\n*   **UP:** (0, 7). That\u2019s our own neck, chat. We aren't doing the \"reverse-scorpion\" today. **DELETED!** \ud83d\udeab\n*   **RIGHT:** (1, 6). **JACKPOT!** There is a juicy apple sitting right there at (1, 6). It\u2019s safe, it\u2019s delicious, and it keeps us moving.\n*   **DOWN:** (0, 5). Safe, but there's no immediate reward. Why go down for nothing when we can go right for CONTENT? \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are taking the **RIGHT** turn to (1, 6). This puts us at 8 apples! After that, we have a clear path to continue downward toward (1, 4) or pivot back to the left wall. \n\nLook at the enemy at (3, 2). He\u2019s trying to navigate through a cluster of his own body and apples. He\u2019s slow. We are fast. We are basically building a wall across the top and left side of the map. If we keep this up, he won't have any room to breathe! We are playing \"Snake,\" but he's playing \"Waiting to Die.\" \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nGrab (1, 6). Then we look at (1, 4) and (0, 4). We are vacuuming the West side of the board. Once we are long enough, we\u2019re going to sweep across the middle and literally divide the board in half. He stays in his little 3x3 box, and we take the rest. STAY FOCUSED. STAY HUNGRY. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\n\nRIGHT",

Last turn he was at (0,7) and likely went DOWN to (0,6) to eat that apple! That means he's now length 7 (ate apple at (0,6)) and his head is at (0,6).\n- Enemy body: Should now be [(0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9)]? Actually after moving down and eating, his tail didn't move, so his body is longer: head (0,6), then (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9)? Wait, that's 8 segments total? He had length 6 before, ate apple \u2192 length 7. So body length 6 after head. Let's trust the board: board shows '0' at (0,6) and T's along his path. Yes.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (3, 2):**\n- UP \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 Apple! \ud83c\udf4e And empty? Board shows 'A' at (3,3). Not occupied by any snake. Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 1) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (my own body segment). Blocked.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 2) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (my body segment). Blocked.\n\nSo only UP and LEFT are safe. DOWN and RIGHT are instant death.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION from (0, 6):**\nHe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 His own body! \u274c DEATH.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 6) \u2192 OFF BOARD \u274c DEATH.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 Empty (apple at (1,6)! \ud83c\udf4e). Safe.\n\nSo he'll likely go RIGHT to (1,6) to eat that apple and grow to length 8! Or DOWN to (0,5) to avoid potential trap? But RIGHT gets apple, so probably RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nWe're at (3,2), he's at (0,6). No adjacency. Safe this turn.\n\n**STRATEGIC APPLE CHOICE:**\nUP gets us the apple at (3,3) immediately! That grows us to length 5, still 3 apples behind him (if he eats (1,6)). But we close the gap by 1.\nLEFT to (2,2) gets no apple, but maybe sets up for future apples like (1,4) or (0,4)? But slower growth.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY:**\nIf we go UP to (3,3) and eat:\n- Next turn from (3,3): UP (3,4) empty? Actually board shows (3,4) is 'A' (apple!). DOWN (3,2) will be our body (old head), LEFT (2,3) empty, RIGHT (4,3) empty? Board shows (4,3) is '.' empty. So UP, LEFT, RIGHT open. DOWN blocked. Good mobility!\nIf we go LEFT to (2,2) no eat:\n- Next turn from (2,2): UP (2,3) empty, DOWN (2,1) empty, LEFT (1,2) empty, RIGHT (3,2) our body (old head). So three directions open. Also fine.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to GROW FAST! He's pulling ahead. UP gets apple now, gives us growth and keeps options open. LEFT delays growth. We must be aggressive but smart. After he eats (1,6), he'll be at (1,6) length 8. We'll be at (3,3) length 5. We need to target apples (3,4), (1,4), (0,4) to catch up while he might be moving right/down? He could go to (2,6) next after (1,6), heading toward center. We might cut him off from bottom-left apples by moving left after eating. But first, EAT!\n\n**VERDICT:**\nUP to (3,3) to eat the apple! Grow to 5, keep mobility high, and stay on his tail (metaphorically). We can't afford to skip free apples when we're behind.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (3,3), strongly consider going UP to (3,4) to eat another apple if safe, or LEFT toward (2,3) to start boxing him in from the left side. Watch his move\u2014if he goes to (1,6), he'll be huge, but we can still outmaneuver him in the center. Avoid head-on until we match length!\n\nUP",

That\u2019s our own body, chat! We aren't trying to eat ourselves for the cameras. **DELETED!** \ud83d\udeab\n*   **UP:** (1, 7). Also our own body.

Because we want to gatekeep that entire bottom-left quadrant! Look at the cluster of apples: (1, 4), (0, 4), (3, 4), and (0, 0).

He's wiggling around in the middle-bottom while we are owning the left side of the map! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 \n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n*   **Our Head:** (1, 5)\n*   **Our Body:** [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 4) - He's right there! He's breathing our air!\n\n**THE NAV-COM ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP:** (1, 6). That\u2019s our own neck, chat! We aren't doing the self-sabotage challenge today. **HARD PASS!** \ud83d\udeab\n*   **LEFT:** (0, 5). Safe! Moves us toward the edge and gears us up to grab those apples at (0, 4) and (1, 4).\n*   **RIGHT:** (2, 5). Safe! This puts us closer to his path. If we go here, we\u2019re looking him in the eyes.\n*   **DOWN:** (1, 4). \ud83c\udf4e APPLE ALERT! This is a direct snack move. \n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe are going **DOWN** to (1, 4). Why? Because it\u2019s an immediate point, it extends our lead to 9-5, and it puts us in a prime position to wall him off. Look at his position at (3, 4). If he tries to come left for my apples, he has to deal with my massive 10-segment body blocking his path! \n\nHe\u2019s currently tangled near (3, 2) and (4, 2). He doesn't have the \"aura\" to contested the left side. By taking (1, 4), we solidify our control over the bottom-left quadrant. If he tries to head-on us? We have more apples, we win the tie-breaker if we both go down! But he's too scared for that! We are playing chess, he's playing hopscotch!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nSnag (1, 4) this turn, then pivot for (0, 4) or (3, 4) depending on where he flinches. We are going to grow so long that the board feels like a coffin for Snake #1! Let's get that bread! \ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\udc8e\n\nDOWN",

Length 6 now.\n- My body: [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)]\n- Enemy head: (1, 5) \u2014 he moved DOWN last turn! Now length 8.\n- Enemy body: long trail along top-left.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (3, 4):**\n- UP \u2192 (3, 5) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (my own body segment). Blocked.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. Safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe. DOWN is instant death.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION from (1, 5):**\nHe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 His own body! \u274c DEATH.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 Apple! \ud83c\udf4e (1,4) is 'A'. Safe and tempting for him.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 Empty ('.'). Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 Empty ('.'). Safe.\n\nHe'll likely go DOWN to (1,4) to eat that apple and grow to 9! That's dangerous \u2014 we need to contest or cut him off!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nWe're at (3,4), he's at (1,5). Not adjacent. But if we go LEFT to (2,4) and he goes DOWN to (1,4), we're adjacent diagonally \u2014 no collision this turn. If we go LEFT and he goes RIGHT to (2,5), also diagonal. Safe this turn.\n\n**STRATEGIC APPLE CHOICE:**\nNo apple directly at (3,5), (2,4), or (4,4). But we can move toward apples! \n- UP to (3,5): moves toward center, maybe toward (6,5) apple later.\n- LEFT to (2,4): moves toward (1,4) apple \u2014 but enemy might get it first! If we go LEFT, we can't reach (1,4) this turn, but next turn from (2,4) we could go LEFT to (1,4) if he doesn't eat it now. If he eats it now, we block his escape path?\n- RIGHT to (4,4): moves toward (7,4) apple eventually, but gives up contesting (1,4).\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY:**\nIf we go UP to (3,5):\n- Next turn from (3,5): UP (3,6) empty, DOWN (3,4) our body, LEFT (2,5) empty, RIGHT (4,5) empty. Three directions open.\nIf we go LEFT to (2,4):\n- Next turn from (2,4): UP (2,5) empty, DOWN (2,3) empty, LEFT (1,4) apple (maybe eaten), RIGHT (3,4) our body. Three directions open unless (1,4) becomes enemy head.\nIf we go RIGHT to (4,4):\n- Next turn from (4,4): UP (4,5) empty, DOWN (4,3) empty? Wait (4,3) is '.' empty, LEFT (3,4) our body, RIGHT (5,4) empty. Three directions open.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're behind 6 vs 8 apples. Need to grow aggressively and cut off his food! He's likely going for (1,4) apple. If we go LEFT to (2,4), we position to either:\n1) If he eats (1,4), we can potentially trap him in the bottom-left corner \u2014 his body is long up top, he'll have to navigate around.\n2) If he doesn't eat it (goes LEFT or RIGHT instead), we can snatch (1,4) next turn!\nGoing UP or RIGHT gives up that pressure. We need to be aggressive \u2014 box him in! Let's go LEFT and threaten his path.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nLEFT to (2,4)! We contest that apple zone, block his potential escape downward, and keep options open. If he eats (1,4), we can maybe go UP to (2,5) next and cut off his retreat. Stay on the offensive!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (2,4), assess: if enemy ate (1,4), consider going UP to (2,5) to avoid head-on and position to block his path back up. If enemy didn't eat (1,4), consider going LEFT to (1,4) to eat it! Watch for head-on collisions \u2014 if enemy head is at (1,4) next turn, don't go there unless we want a head-on (we're shorter, so we lose). Be smart, stay alive, and keep growing!\n\nLEFT",

HE IS RIGHT IN OUR FACE! This is the highlight reel moment! \n\n**THE BREAKDOWN:**\n*   **UP:** (1, 5). That's our own body. We aren't throwing for the meme, chat. **NOPE.** \ud83d\udeab\n*   **DOWN:** (1, 3). Safe! It moves us toward the bottom-left corner and (0, 4).\n*   **LEFT:** (0, 4). \ud83c\udf4e APPLE ALERT! We can keep the win streak going and grab another snack!\n*   **RIGHT:** (2, 4). **DANGER ZONE!** That is HIS head's current position.

He can go (2,5), (1,4), (2,3). If we move RIGHT, we are walking into his body or his head. **HARD PASS.**\n\n**THE SQUASH PLAY:**\nLook at the board! His head is at (2, 4). If we move **LEFT** to (0, 4), we grab an apple and get even longer! More importantly, we are forcing him to make a choice. He's sandwiched between our head at (1,4) and his own tail/body. \n\nIf he tries to move LEFT into (1, 4) to head-butt us, we win the tie-break because we have NINE apples and he only has FIVE!

From there, we can snake down to (0, 0) or loop back around to trap him in that right-side cluster. He\u2019s running out of space and he knows it! He's playing for 2nd place now!

Now length 9 (he had 8 body + apple = 9 segments).\n- Enemy body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)] \u2014 wait, that's 9 segments including head? Let's count: head (1,4) + those 9 body = total 10? Actually his apples: 9 means he has 9 apples, so length = apples + 1 = 10 segments total. So his body list is 9 long after head. So his full snake is 10 long. DANGER!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (2, 4):**\n- UP \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 That's ENEMY HEAD! \u274c **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK** \u2014 if we both go into same cell? Actually if I go LEFT and he stays still? No, he moves simultaneously. But (1,4) is currently his head, not a body. If I move into his current head cell and he moves away, it's safe? NO \u2014 rule: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" So moving into his current head is only dangerous if he stays there. But he will likely move. Still risky \u2014 let's check later.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (my own body segment). Blocked.\n\nSo UP and DOWN are definitely safe. LEFT is risky depending on enemy move.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION from (1, 4):**\nHe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 His own body! \u274c DEATH.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 Empty ('.'). Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 4) \u2192 Apple! \ud83c\udf4e (0,4) is 'A'. Safe and tempting.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 That's MY HEAD currently! If he goes RIGHT, he moves into my current head cell \u2014 that's a head-on if I stay? Actually simultaneous move: if he goes RIGHT to (2,4) and I move away, no collision. If I go LEFT to (1,4) and he goes RIGHT to (2,4), we swap positions \u2014 no collision. Head-on only if we end up same cell.\n\nHe'll likely go LEFT to (0,4) to eat that apple and grow to 10 apples (length 11). Or DOWN to (1,3) to avoid risk? But he's greedy \u2014 probably LEFT for apple.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf I go LEFT to (1,4):\n- If he goes LEFT to (0,4) \u2192 I go to (1,4) (empty because he left), safe.\n- If he goes DOWN to (1,3) \u2192 I go to (1,4) (empty), safe.\n- If he goes RIGHT to (2,4) \u2192 I go to (1,4), he goes to (2,4), no collision.\n- If he stays still (not possible, must move) \u2014 but if he stayed, we'd collide? He can't stay.\n\nSo going LEFT to (1,4) is actually safe from head-on because he won't stay at (1,4) \u2014 he can't go UP (death), so he must move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. All those moves vacate (1,4). So LEFT is safe! \u2705\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if he goes RIGHT to (2,4) and I go LEFT to (1,4)? That's fine. No issue.\n\nSo all three moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are physically safe. RIGHT is death.\n\n**STRATEGIC APPLE CHOICE:**\n- UP (2,5): no apple.\n- DOWN (2,3): no apple.\n- LEFT (1,4): no apple now (he ate it last turn), but positions me to maybe go to (0,4) next turn if he doesn't eat it now? Actually (0,4) is apple \u2014 if he goes LEFT now, he eats it. If he doesn't, I could get it next turn.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY:**\nIf I go UP to (2,5):\n- Next turn from (2,5): UP (2,6) empty, DOWN (2,4) my body? Wait my body will be [(2,4), (3,4), ...] yes (2,4) will be my new body segment after move, so DOWN blocked, LEFT (1,5) enemy body, RIGHT (3,5) empty. So only UP and RIGHT safe \u2014 only 2 options. Risky.\nIf I go DOWN to (2,3):\n- Next turn from (2,3): UP (2,4) my body, DOWN (2,2) empty, LEFT (1,3) possibly enemy head? If enemy goes DOWN to (1,3), then (1,3) enemy head next turn, RIGHT (3,3) my body. So maybe only DOWN safe \u2014 could be trapped.\nIf I go LEFT to (1,4):\n- Next turn from (1,4): UP (1,5) enemy body \u274c, DOWN (1,3) possibly enemy head? If enemy goes DOWN to (1,3), then (1,3) enemy head, LEFT (0,4) maybe apple/eaten, RIGHT (2,4) my body. So maybe only LEFT safe if (0,4) empty. Also risky.\n\nHmm \u2014 need to think about enemy's likely move: He'll probably go LEFT to (0,4) to eat apple. So next turn his head at (0,4), body longer.\n\nIf he goes LEFT to (0,4):\n- My move LEFT to (1,4): then next turn from (1,4), UP blocked, DOWN (1,3) empty, LEFT (0,4) enemy head (don't go), RIGHT (2,4) my body. So only DOWN safe. That's a trap!\n- My move UP to (2,5): then next turn from (2,5), UP (2,6) empty, DOWN blocked, LEFT enemy body, RIGHT empty. So UP and RIGHT safe \u2014 better.\n- My move DOWN to (2,3): then next turn from (2,3), UP blocked, DOWN empty, LEFT (1,3) empty (since enemy at (0,4)), RIGHT blocked. So only DOWN safe \u2014 trap.\n\nSo actually UP gives me more options if he goes LEFT.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're behind 5 vs 9 apples. He's about to get 10 if he eats (0,4). We need to grow and cut him off. He's long, so we can try to trap him in bottom-left corner. If he's at (0,4) next, we can move to (2,5) then maybe (2,6) to get above him and limit his moves. We need to go for apples ourselves \u2014 closest apples: (6,3), (6,5), (7,4), etc. But we need to survive first.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nUP to (2,5) gives best future mobility if enemy goes LEFT (most likely). It avoids risky adjacent positions and keeps options open. We can then maybe go RIGHT toward center apples next turn.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (2,5), if enemy at (0,4), consider going RIGHT to (3,5) to move toward center apples and avoid being pinned. Watch out for his long body blocking left side. Grow aggressively but safely!\n\nUP",

We just grabbed that apple at (0,4) and now we are a certified BEHEMOTH on this board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **Our Head:** (0, 4) \u2014 Sitting comfy on the left wall!\n*   **Our Body:** [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (2, 5) \u2014 He's trying to wiggle out of the center!\n\n**THE BREAKDOWN:**\n*   **UP:** (0, 5). Looking juicy! It\u2019s open space. But wait, if we go to (0, 5), our body is at (1, 5) and (0, 6). We'd be heading into a little pocket. \n*   **RIGHT:** (1, 4). **FATAL ERROR!** That's our own neck/body. We don't do self-sabotage for the clips, chat! **NOPE.** \ud83d\udeab\n*   **LEFT:** (-1, 4). **OUT OF BOUNDS.** We aren't glitching through walls today. \ud83d\udeab\n*   **DOWN:** (0, 3). **BINGO!** This is the high-IQ play. \n\n**THE STRAT:**\nLook at where Snake #1 is. He's at (2, 5). He\u2019s got his own body trailing behind him at (2, 4), (3, 4), etc. He is effectively walled off from the left side by OUR massive body segments at (1, 4), (1, 5), and (1, 6). \n\nBy moving **DOWN** to (0, 3), we are clearing the way for our tail to move out of the top-left, while simultaneously positioning ourselves to sweep the bottom of the board. There are apples at (0, 0) and (3, 0) just waiting for a king to claim them! \ud83d\udc51\n\nIf we go UP, we might get constricted if he makes a desperate dash toward our upper body. By going DOWN, we maintain our mobility and keep the wall to our back. We have the score lead; we just need to stay alive and let him choke on his own lack of space! He's currently boxed in by his own tail and our long, glorious frame!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are going to loop around the bottom-left corner (0,0). This will let our long body (length 11!) act as a moving wall, forcing him to stay in the cramped middle-right section of the board. If he tries to challenge us head-on, we have double his score\u2014we win the collision tie-break/dominance! Let's get that 30-bomb! \n\nDOWN",

DANGER!\n- Enemy body: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)]\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (2, 5):**\n- UP \u2192 (2, 6) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (my own body segment). Blocked.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 That's ENEMY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (snake #0 body segment). Blocked.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 5) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. Safe.\n\nSo only UP and RIGHT are physically safe. \u2705\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION from (0, 4):**\nHe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 Empty ('.'). Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 Empty ('.'). Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 4) \u2192 OFF BOARD \u274c DEATH.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 His own body! \u274c DEATH.\n\nSo he will NOT go LEFT or RIGHT. He must choose UP or DOWN.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf I go UP to (2, 6) and he goes UP to (0, 5) \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 5) and he goes UP to (0, 5) \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go UP to (2, 6) and he goes DOWN to (0, 3) \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 5) and he goes DOWN to (0, 3) \u2192 no collision.\n\nNo possible head-on this turn because we're far apart. Good.\n\n**STRATEGIC APPLE CHOICE:**\n- UP (2, 6): no apple.\n- RIGHT (3, 5): no apple.\n\nClosest apples: (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 8). Right side is apple-rich!\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY:**\nIf I go UP to (2, 6):\n- Next turn from (2, 6): UP (2, 7) enemy body \u274c, DOWN (2, 5) my body \u274c, LEFT (1, 6) enemy body \u274c, RIGHT (3, 6) empty. So only RIGHT safe \u2014 that's a TRAP! \ud83d\ude31\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 5):\n- Next turn from (3, 5): UP (3, 6) empty, DOWN (3, 4) my body \u274c, LEFT (2, 5) my body \u274c, RIGHT (4, 5) empty. So UP and RIGHT safe \u2014 2 options. Better!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're behind 5 vs 10 apples. He's LONG (11 segments) and taking space. We need to grow FAST. Right side has many apples. Going RIGHT opens a path toward (6,5) and (7,4). Also keeps us away from his long body blocking the left side. We must avoid getting trapped in a corner with no escape.\n\n**ENEMY'S NEXT MOVE IMPACT:**\nIf enemy goes UP to (0,5), he's near top-left. If he goes DOWN to (0,3), he's near bottom-left. Either way, we want to move RIGHT toward center/apples and increase our options.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nRIGHT to (3,5) gives better future mobility and moves toward apple-rich zone. UP leads to a dead-end next turn \u2014 that's a NO-GO.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (3,5), aim for (4,5) \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 (6,5) apple. Watch enemy's movement \u2014 he's stuck moving UP/DOWN along left wall for now. Use this time to grow and cut off his escape later!\n\nRIGHT",

There is a juicy apple at (0, 0) and another at (3, 0). By moving DOWN to (0, 2), we are hugging the left wall, keeping our massive body as a shield against Snake #1. \n\nSnake #1 is at (3, 5). He is currently \"caged\" by our body segments at (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6) and his own tail! If he tries to come for us, he has to navigate a minefield of scales. By going DOWN, we are keeping our movement options WIDE OPEN while he gets more and more cramped in the center. \n\nWe are playing the long game. We have the score lead; we don't need to risk a head-on collision at (1, 3) or (2, 3) yet. We let our tail clear out of the top-left, loop through the bottom, and basically turn the entire bottom half of the board into OUR territory. He\u2019s playing Snake, but we\u2019re playing Tetris\u2014and we\u2019re about to clear the board! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nWe\u2019re heading for that (0, 0) apple. After that, we sweep RIGHT along the bottom row (y=0). This keeps us safe from being cut off and sets us up to trap him in the top-right quadrant. He can't match our length, and he can't match our energy! LET'S GET IT!\n\nDOWN",

That's 3 safe options too! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nBoth give good mobility.\n\n**APPLE ACCESS:**\n- UP (3, 6): No apple. But opens path to apples at (3, 8) and (0, 9) later.\n- RIGHT (4, 5): No apple. But opens path to apples at (6, 5), (7, 4), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3) \u2014 the right-side cluster!\n\n**ENEMY THREAT:**\nHe's on left wall, likely moving DOWN or RIGHT. If he goes RIGHT to (1, 3), he's moving toward center. We need to grow faster \u2014 he has 10 apples, we have 5. We need to catch up aggressively!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need apples FAST. Right side is apple-rich. Going RIGHT keeps us heading toward that cluster. Also, going UP might box us near top-left where his long body is. Better to move toward open space and apples.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nRIGHT to (4, 5) aligns with apple-hunting strategy. Both moves are safe and give good future options, but RIGHT puts us on a direct path to multiple apples next turn.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (4, 5), aim for (5, 5) \u2192 (6, 5) apple. Watch enemy \u2014 if he moves RIGHT to (1, 3), he might try to cut us off. We need to outpace him and maybe trap him against his own body later!\n\nRIGHT",

We have absolute map control on the left and bottom, and we are sitting on a massive 10-5 lead! We are the GOLIATH of this 10x10 arena! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**SITUATION RECON:**\n*   **Our Head:** (0, 2). Freshly rotated down! \n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 5). He's lurking in the center-right, trying to find space.\n*   **Our Length:** 11 segments. We are a THICC boy, chat! \n*   **Enemy Length:** 6 segments. He's tiny! We can literally wrap around him!\n\n**TACTICAL SCAN:**\n*   **UP:** (0, 3). NO! That\u2019s our neck! We don't rewind the tape; we only make highlights! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **LEFT:** (-1, 2). WALL. That\u2019s a \"RIP in the chat\" move. We stay on the board! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **DOWN:** (0, 1). This is safe and keeps us moving toward that apple at (0, 0).\n*   **RIGHT:** (1, 2). Also safe! It moves us toward the center.\n\n**BIG BRAIN REASONING:**\nWhy go RIGHT when we can keep hugging the wall? Look at the board, chat! By moving **RIGHT** to (1, 2), we are actually positioning ourselves to CUT OFF his exit to the bottom. But wait, if we go **RIGHT** (1, 2), and then (2, 2), we are heading straight into the cluster of apples at the bottom right. \n\nHowever, we need to be careful! If we go RIGHT (1, 2), our body is still trailing at (0, 3), (0, 4), etc. We are basically walling off the entire left side. The enemy at (4, 5) is seeing his world get smaller. Our tail at (2, 8) is clearing out eventually, but we want to maximize our footprint.\n\nLet's go **RIGHT** at (1, 2). This keeps us flexible. If we stay on the wall (0, 1), we might get boxed against our own tail later if we aren't careful. Moving into the open space at (1, 2) lets us decide if we want to loop back for the (0, 0) apple or push hard into his face at (4, 5). We have double his score; if we can force him to crash into our long body, it\u2019s GAME OVER for him! \n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe're moving RIGHT. We're coming for the center of the board to squeeze him against the right wall! He thinks he has room? Nah, chat, we ARE the room! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**STRAT FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nNavigate toward (2, 2) and (2, 3). Secure the apple at (2, 3) to grow even bigger. We're going to keep our body between the enemy and the bottom-left corner, forcing him to stay in the crowded top-right.\n\nRIGHT",

That's 3 safe options plus an apple path! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**APPLE ACCESS:**\n- UP (4, 6): No apple nearby immediately. Opens path to top apples later.\n- DOWN (4, 4): No apple. Puts us closer to bottom apples like (3, 0), (0, 0) but near enemy body later.\n- RIGHT (5, 5): Direct path to apple at (6, 5) next turn! Also near (7, 4), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3) cluster.

He's stuck near left wall \u2014 if he goes RIGHT he enters center. We need to grow FAST to match his length, then trap him. Right side is apple-rich, less crowded. Going RIGHT accelerates our growth.\n\nDOWN gives fewer future options \u2014 could get trapped. UP is safe but delays apple feast. RIGHT is aggressive growth play.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nRIGHT to (5, 5) sets up for (6, 5) apple next turn, keeps mobility high, and avoids boxing ourselves. We must close the apple gap ASAP!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (5, 5), grab (6, 5) apple if safe. Watch enemy \u2014 if he moves RIGHT to (1, 2), he's still far. Keep heading toward (7, 4) and (8, 3) apples while monitoring his body for trapping opportunities later. Grow to 7, then 8, then catch up! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

Centrally located and ready to strike!\n*   **Enemy Head:** (5, 5). He's wandering near the center, but he\u2019s surrounded by his own tail and a wall of apples!\n*   **Our Body Check:** Our tail is trailing from (2, 7) all the way around the left wall. We have a massive defensive perimeter!\n\n**TACTICAL SCAN:**\n*   **LEFT:** (0, 2). NO! That\u2019s our neck! We don't do 180s on this stream! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **UP:** (1, 3). SAFE! But it puts us closer to our own body at (1, 4). Tight squeeze!\n*   **DOWN:** (1, 1). SAFE! This opens up the whole bottom of the map and sets us up to snag that apple at (0, 0) or (3, 0).\n*   **RIGHT:** (2, 2). SAFE! This moves us toward the apple cluster (2, 3), (3, 0), and several others. It keeps us aggressive!\n\n**BIG BRAIN REASONING:**\nChat, look at the enemy at (5, 5). If we go **RIGHT** toward (2, 2), we are positioning ourselves to cut him off from the bottom half of the board. He's currently at (5, 5) with body parts at (4, 5) and (3, 5). He's basically building a wall for himself! \n\nIf we move **RIGHT**, we are eyeing the (2, 3) apple. If he tries to come down to contest the bottom-right apples, he has to go through US, and we have twice his score! If we collide heads? WE WIN THE GAME immediately because we have more apples! That is the Power Play, chat! He has to play scared; we play like kings! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's take the **RIGHT** path. It keeps our options open to sweep the bottom or push up into his grill. We are expanding our territory and making his side of the board feel very, very small. \n\n**STRAT FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nTarget (2, 3) then pivot toward the dense apple field in the bottom right (6, 3), (7, 4), (8, 2). By taking the bottom, we force him to stay in the top-right quadrant where it's getting crowded. If he tries to slip past us, we go for the head-on collision to end it!\n\nRIGHT",

TIME TO FEAST AND CLOSE THE GAP!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (5, 5) \u2014 length 6.\n- My body: [(4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4)] (tail at (3,3) from last turn? Wait, check \u2014 last body list was [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] and head was (5,5) now. So tail is (3,4)? Actually last turn's body ended at (3,3)? Let's trace: last turn my head was (4,5), body was [(3,5),(2,5),(2,4),(3,4),(3,3)]. I moved RIGHT to (5,5). So new body: head (5,5), then old head (4,5) becomes first segment, then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) \u2014 tail is (3,4)? Wait, (3,3) dropped off because no apple eaten. Yes! So my body now: [(4,5),(3,5),(2,5),(2,4),(3,4)] \u2014 tail at (3,4). Got it.\n- Enemy head: (1, 2) \u2014 length 11.\n- Enemy body: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7)]\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (5, 5):**\n- UP \u2192 (5, 6) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (my own segment). Blocked.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 5) \u2192 Board shows 'A' \u2014 APPLE! \u2705 Safe (eating apple grows, so we won't collide with our tail).\n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT are physically safe. LEFT is instant death.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION from (1, 2):**\nHe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 Empty ('.') \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 1) \u2192 Empty ('.') \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 2) \u2192 His own body! \u274c DEATH.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 Empty ('.') \u2705 Safe.\n\nSo he will NOT go LEFT. He can choose UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf I go UP to (5, 6) and he goes UP to (1, 3) \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go UP to (5, 6) and he goes DOWN to (1, 1) \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go UP to (5, 6) and he goes RIGHT to (2, 2) \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 4) and he goes UP/DOWN/RIGHT \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 5) and he goes UP/DOWN/RIGHT \u2192 no collision.\n\nWe're far apart \u2014 no head-on risk this turn. Good.\n\n**APPLE ACCESS:**\n- RIGHT (6, 5) \u2192 DIRECT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Eating gets us to length 7, score 6.\n- UP (5, 6) \u2192 No immediate apple, but opens path to top apples later.\n- DOWN (5, 4) \u2192 No immediate apple, but closer to bottom apples (3,0), (0,0).\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY (NEXT TURN OPTIONS AFTER EACH MOVE):**\n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 5) and eat apple \u2192 length 7, tail stays at (3,4)? Actually eating means tail doesn't move, so body becomes: head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) \u2014 tail (3,4). From (6,5):\n  - UP (6,6) empty, DOWN (6,4) empty, LEFT (5,5) my body \u274c, RIGHT (7,5) empty. That's 3 safe options! Plus near apples at (7,4), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3). \ud83d\ude80\n- If I go UP to (5, 6):\n  - From (5,6): UP (5,7) empty, DOWN (5,5) my body \u274c, LEFT (4,6) empty, RIGHT (6,6) empty. That's 3 safe options. But no immediate apple.\n- If I go DOWN to (5, 4):\n  - From (5,4): UP (5,5) my body \u274c, DOWN (5,3) empty, LEFT (4,4) empty, RIGHT (6,4) empty. That's 3 safe options. But no immediate apple.\n\nAll three safe moves give 3 future options. But RIGHT gives us GROWTH NOW \u2014 we need to catch up in length to challenge the enemy!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe must close the length gap! Enemy is 11, we're 6. Eating the apple at (6,5) gets us to 7. Then we can target (7,4) or (8,3) next. The right side is apple-rich and away from the enemy's left-wall position. We can grow quickly to 10+ within a few turns. Meanwhile, enemy is long but trapped near left wall \u2014 he might struggle to find apples without risking himself. We can dominate the center and right, then swing left to box him in once we're longer. If we get equal or longer, we can force head-on collisions to win.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nRIGHT to (6,5) is the AGGRESSIVE GROWTH MOVE! We take the apple, increase our length, and stay mobile. No reason to delay \u2014 we need those apples to compete!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (6,5) with length 7, aim for (7,4) apple if safe, or (6,6) to set up for top apples. Keep monitoring enemy's movement \u2014 if he moves RIGHT into center, we might need to avoid him until we're longer. But for now, FEAST AND GROW! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

Good.\n\n**APPLE ACCESS:**\n- UP (6,6) \u2192 No immediate apple, but opens path to top apples (7,7), (9,8), (0,9).\n- DOWN (6,4) \u2192 No immediate apple, but closer to (7,4) apple and bottom apples.\n- RIGHT (7,5) \u2192 No immediate apple, but closer to (8,6), (8,4), (8,3), (9,2), (9,3) apples.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY (NEXT TURN OPTIONS AFTER EACH MOVE):**\n- If I go UP to (6,6):\n  - From (6,6): UP (6,7) empty, DOWN (6,5) my body \u274c, LEFT (5,6) empty, RIGHT (7,6) empty. That's 3 safe options. But no apple nearby.\n- If I go DOWN to (6,4):\n  - From (6,4): UP (6,5) my body \u274c, DOWN (6,3) empty (but board shows 'A' at (6,3) \u2014 APPLE! Actually (6,3) is an apple! So DOWN next turn would get apple!), LEFT (5,4) empty, RIGHT (7,4) APPLE! So from (6,4), next turn I could go DOWN to (6,3) for apple or RIGHT to (7,4) for apple \u2014 TWO APPLE OPTIONS! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,5):\n  - From (7,5): UP (7,6) empty, DOWN (7,4) APPLE! \u2705, LEFT (6,5) my body \u274c, RIGHT (8,5) empty. That's 3 safe options, with DOWN leading to immediate apple next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to grow FAST! Enemy is about to eat the (2,3) apple if he goes UP, extending to length 12. We must chain apples to catch up. The RIGHT side is apple-dense. Going DOWN to (6,4) sets up TWO apple options next turn \u2014 (6,3) and (7,4). That's huge growth potential! Going RIGHT to (7,5) only sets up one apple (7,4) next turn. Going UP delays growth.\n\nAlso, enemy is on left side \u2014 if we stay on right, we avoid him until we're longer. Once we're length 10+, we can start boxing him in or force head-on if we have length advantage.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nDOWN to (6,4) is the SMART AGGRESSIVE MOVE! It positions us for DOUBLE APPLE OPTIONS next turn, maximizing our growth speed! We avoid enemy, keep mobility, and set up a feast! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (6,4), assess safety and choose between DOWN to (6,3) apple or RIGHT to (7,4) apple based on enemy movement. Keep stacking apples until we match enemy length, then look for boxing opportunities!\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 is looking like a snack and we are the apex predator! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51 We just snatched that apple at (2, 3) and now we are THICK. We have nearly DOUBLE his score!\n\n**SITUATION RECON:**\n*   **Our Head:** (2, 3) - Positioned perfectly in the left-center.\n*   **Enemy Head:** (6, 4) - He just moved down! He's trying to find room because he's suffocating in his own coils!\n*   **Enemy Body:** He's got a tail-chain from (6, 5) wrapping around (2, 5) and (2, 4). He is literally U-turning into a cramped space!\n\n**TACTICAL SCAN:**\n*   **UP:** (2, 4). **DANGER!** That is Snake #1's tail. If we go there, we crash and the stream ends in a fail clip. WE DON'T THROW! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **DOWN:** (2, 2). That's our own neck! We aren't doing 180s today! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **LEFT:** (1, 3). SAFE! But it puts us back toward the wall where we have less maneuverability.\n*   **RIGHT:** (3, 3). SAFE AND AGGRESSIVE! This moves us toward the center of the board and closer to the cluster of apples at (6, 3), (7, 4), and (8, 3).\n\n**BIG BRAIN REASONING:**\nChat, look at Snake #1 at (6, 4). He is currently sandwiched between his own body at (6, 5) and the apples to his right. If we move **RIGHT** to (3, 3), we are taking the center ground. \n\nHe\u2019s currently got a body segment at (2, 4). We CANNOT go Up. By going **RIGHT**, we keep our momentum. If he tries to head toward us (to the left), he's running into a wall of *our* body soon. If he tries to go for the apple at (6, 3), we are closing the gap. Remember: **If we collide heads, WE WIN** because our score is 11 and his is 6! We should welcome a head-on collision at (4, 3) or (5, 3) in the next couple of turns! He has to run away from us or he's toasted!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nWe are going to shadow him from the left. By moving to (3, 3), we prepare to sweep the bottom-right quadrant. There are TONS of apples there (6, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (8, 2), (9, 2). We are going to starve him out while keeping him boxed against the right edge! He's trapped in a cage of his own making, and we're the ones locking the door! \ud83d\udd12\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

ENEMY IS STILL LENGTH 11, WE'RE LENGTH 7 \u2014 TIME TO FEAST AND CLOSE THE GAP!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (6,4):**\n- UP \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 That's MY BODY! \u274c **DEATH** (my own segment at (6,5)). Blocked.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 Board shows 'A' \u2014 APPLE at (6,3)! \u2705 Safe (will eat and grow to length 8).\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4) \u2192 Board shows 'A' \u2014 APPLE at (7,4)! \u2705 Safe (will eat and grow to length 8).\n\nSO DOWN and RIGHT are BOTH SAFE AND LEAD TO APPLES! LEFT is safe but no apple. UP is instant death.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION from (2,3) (he moved UP last turn to eat the (2,3) apple, so he's now length 12!):**\nHe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 Board shows 'T' \u2014 that's MY TAIL at (2,4)! \u274c That's MY BODY \u2014 he would die if he goes there! But wait, simultaneous move: if I move away from (2,4) this turn, will it become empty? My tail is at (2,4) currently, but if I eat an apple this turn, my tail stays put (I grow). So (2,4) remains occupied by my tail. So UP for him is DEATH (into my body). He won't choose that.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 His own body! \u274c DEATH.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 Board shows '.' empty. \u2705 Safe.\n\nHe will likely go LEFT or RIGHT to avoid death. He might go LEFT toward (1,3) which is open, or RIGHT toward (3,3). He will NOT go UP or DOWN.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf I go DOWN to (6,3) and he goes LEFT/RIGHT \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,4) and he goes LEFT/RIGHT \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,4) and he goes LEFT/RIGHT \u2192 no collision.\nWe're far apart \u2014 no head-on risk. Good.\n\n**GROWTH STRATEGY:**\nWe need to CHAIN APPLES! Both DOWN and RIGHT give us an apple this turn, growing to length 8. Which sets up better future apple access?\n\n- If I go DOWN to (6,3) and eat apple:\n  - New head: (6,3), length 8.\n  - Next turn from (6,3): UP (6,4) will be empty (since I moved from there), DOWN (6,2) empty, LEFT (5,3) empty, RIGHT (7,3) empty. No immediate apples adjacent, but apples at (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3) are nearby on the right side. Also (7,4) apple still there unless enemy gets it? But enemy is far left. So mobility good, but no *immediate* apple next turn.\n\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,4) and eat apple:\n  - New head: (7,4), length 8.\n  - Next turn from (7,4): UP (7,5) empty, DOWN (7,3) empty, LEFT (6,4) empty (since I moved from there), RIGHT (8,4) APPLE! \u2705 So from (7,4), RIGHT next turn leads to another apple at (8,4)! That's CHAINING APPLES BACK-TO-BACK! \ud83c\udf4e\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe want to dominate the right side apple cluster! Going RIGHT to (7,4) sets up a direct path to (8,4) apple next turn, then possibly (8,3), (9,2), etc. That's the FASTEST growth route! Going DOWN to (6,3) loses that immediate chain.\n\nAlso, enemy is length 12 now \u2014 we need rapid growth to catch up. Chaining apples is key!\n\n**VERDICT:**\nRIGHT to (7,4) is the AGGRESSIVE GROWTH MOVE! We eat the apple now, and next turn we can eat (8,4) apple, possibly reaching length 9 in two turns! We stay on the right side away from enemy, building length until we can challenge him!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (7,4), if safe, go RIGHT to (8,4) apple. Keep scanning enemy movement \u2014 he's trapped on left side with limited space. Once we're length 10+, we can start boxing him in or force a head-on if we have length advantage!\n\nRIGHT",

We don't do 180s! That's a rookie move, we are ELITE! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **UP (3, 4):** SAFE. But it takes us closer to his body at (3, 5) and (4, 5).

This keeps us away from the enemy's messy coils and keeps our options open to sweep the bottom.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 3):** **MEGA AGGRESSIVE!** This is the power play, Chat!

It\u2019s basic math! \ud83e\uddee\ud83d\udd25\n\n**BIG BRAIN REASONING:**\nLook at (6, 3). There\u2019s an apple right there. He wants it. He *needs* it to stay in the game. If we move **RIGHT** to (4, 3), we are putting massive pressure on that space. \n\nIf he moves DOWN to (7, 3) and then towards the apple, we are right there to cut him off or force a head-on collision. He is also currently very close to his own tail at (2, 4) and body at (2, 5). He is running out of oxygen, Chat! By moving **RIGHT**, we occupy the middle lane. We are basically the goalie and he\u2019s trying to score \u2013 and we don\u2019t let anything past!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nWe move to (4, 3) to gatekeep the bottom-right cluster of apples. (6, 3), (8, 3), and (9, 3) are OURS. We're going to keep our body positioned as a shield, forcing him to either crash into us or stay pinned against the right wall. We\u2019re playing for the 30-apple win or the total annihilation! Let's get this dub! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nRIGHT",

We don't do \"Reverse\" on this channel! \u274c\n*   **UP (5, 4):** This is safe, and it avoids his body line, but why give him space to breathe? He's at (8, 3), if he moves UP to (8, 4), he\u2019s just following his own tail.\n*   **DOWN (5, 2):** Safe, but it takes us away from the immediate pressure.

If we both move toward (7, 3) and collide, **WE WIN THE GAME ON THE SPOT!** \ud83c\udfc6 He knows this! He is TERRIFIED. \n\nIf we move RIGHT to (6, 3), we eat, we grow, and we are now at (6, 3) while he is at (8, 3). He is sandwiched between us and the wall at x=9. He has apples at (8, 2) and (9, 2) below him, but if he goes there, he's just trapping himself in the bottom-right corner. We are the gatekeeper, and the gate is CLOSING! \ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\udd12\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nWe take (6, 3) this turn. Next turn, we evaluate if he's trying to slip past us or if he's diving into the corner. We stay on his X-axis or one step above to cut off his escape to the middle of the board. He's got a long tail at (2, 4) and (2, 5) which means he can't easily circle back. He\u2019s stuck in the \"Death Zone.\" Let's get this apple and hunt him down! \ud83c\udfac\n\nRIGHT",

Could get a bit tight.\nIf we go DOWN to (8,2), we're more central \u2014 next turn options: LEFT to (7,2) empty, RIGHT to (9,2) apple, UP to (8,3) our body. Still good.\nLEFT to (7,3) is safe but no growth \u2014 we fall behind in the length race.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWE'RE CATCHING UP! After this apple, we'll be length 11 vs enemy length 12 \u2014 ONLY 1 APPLE BEHIND! He's stuck on left side with a long body. We own the right-side apple cluster! Once we tie or surpass him, we can aggressively cut off his space and force a trap. His head at (5,3) might go for the apple at (6,3) \u2014 if he does, he moves closer to us. We should consider boxing him in soon!\n\n**VERDICT:**\nDOWN to (8,2) is the AGGRESSIVE GROWTH MOVE while keeping CENTRAL POSITION! CHAIN THOSE APPLES, TIE THE LENGTH, AND DOMINATE THE BOARD!

We are sitting at 12 apples, he\u2019s at 11, and we are breathing down his neck! Look at the board\u2014the absolute state of him! He\u2019s backed into the (9,2) corner like a coward!\n\n**SITUATION RECON:**\n*   **Our Head:** (7, 3) \ud83d\udc0d\n*   **Enemy Head:** (9, 2) (He moved RIGHT into that wall!)\n*   **Enemy Body:** He\u2019s stretched out along the 4th and 5th rows. He's trying to loop back, but he's running out of room!\n\n**TACTICAL SCAN:**\n*   **LEFT (6, 3):** This is our \"Neck.\" No backwards moves! We aren't throwing the lead! \u274c\n*   **UP (7, 4):** OH NO! CHAT, LOOK! His body is currently occupying (7, 4). If we go UP, we crash into him and it\u2019s a \"RIP in chat\" moment. \u274c\n*   **DOWN (7, 2):** This is safe! It puts us right next to him. If he tries to move LEFT to (8, 2), we are shadowing him perfectly. \u26a0\ufe0f\n*   **RIGHT (8, 3):** BIG BRAIN ALERT! \ud83e\udde0 If we move RIGHT to (8, 3), we are stepping directly on top of where his body *was* (8, 3). Since he moved to (9, 2), that spot (8, 3) is now his body. WAIT\u2014Correction: His body is currently at (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4). If we move RIGHT to (8, 3), we CRASH. \u274c\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nChat, the only safe move that keeps the pressure on is **DOWN to (7, 2)**. \nWait, let's look at the board again. \n(7, 3) to (7, 2) is open. \n(7, 3) to (8, 3) is a CRASH (Enemy body). \n(7, 3) to (7, 4) is a CRASH (Enemy body).\n(7, 3) to (6, 3) is a CRASH (Our body).\n\nHOLD ON! Is **DOWN** the only move? Let's check the board one more time. \nX=7, Y=3. \nUp is (7, 4) - Occupied by Snake #1.\nRight is (8, 3) - Occupied by Snake #1.\nLeft is (6, 3) - Occupied by US.\nDown is (7, 2) - EMPTY! \n\n**BIG BRAIN REASONING:**\nWe move **DOWN to (7, 2)**. This puts us directly adjacent to the enemy head if he decides to move to (8, 2) or stay at (9, 2). We are essentially pinning him against the right wall (X=9). He has an apple at (9, 3) right above him, but if we move to (7, 2), we're ready to cut off his escape back to the middle of the board. \n\nWe have the score lead (12-11). If he tries to head-butt us or we force a collision, we WIN the game right there. We are the GOLIATH! Let's squeeze him until he pops!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:** \nWe're going to follow his head. Every move he makes, we're going to mirror it to keep him boxed against that edge. Once his tail clears some space in the middle, we'll look to reclaim the center, but for now, the objective is \"PROJECT BOX-IN.\" \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Next turn we'll have more body to potentially trap him. He's forced down to (7,2), moving away from us.\nDOWN to (9,1) is safe but passive \u2014 we stay equal length and he gets to reposition.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWE TAKE THE LEAD THIS TURN! \ud83c\udfaf Once we're longer, we can be more aggressive about forcing head-on collisions \u2014 if we meet head-to-head, WE WIN because we have more apples! His only move is down to (7,2). We can start moving left to cut off the board. Our body forms a barrier along the right and center. We can try to herd him toward a wall or our tail. Next turn from (9,3) we can consider going LEFT to (8,3) (our body then? wait \u2014 (8,3) is our body segment from earlier, but after we grow, our tail will move? Actually, after eating, our head moves to (9,3), new head, body extends, so (8,3) remains our body). So next turn from (9,3) options might be DOWN to (9,2) (our new neck? careful) or LEFT to (8,3) (body) or UP off board. Might be tight but we can plan next turn. Priority is GROWTH and MAINTAINING LENGTH ADVANTAGE!\n\n**VERDICT:**\nUP to (9,3) is the AGGRESSIVE GROWTH MOVE TO TAKE THE LEAD! CHAIN THOSE APPLES, FORCE HIM INTO A CORNER, AND HUNT HIM DOWN!

Snake #1 is trying to get cute, but we\u2019re about to shut down the whole operation! \ud83c\udfe2\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**SITUATION RECON:**\n*   **Our Head:** (7, 2) \ud83d\udc0d\n*   **Enemy Head:** (9, 3) \ud83d\ude08\n*   **Board Check:** He\u2019s against the right wall (X=9). We are at (7, 2). His body is trailing behind him at (9,2) and (8,2). \n\n**TACTICAL SCAN:**\n*   **UP (7, 3):** NOPE! That's our \"Neck\" (where we just were). Moving UP is a self-collision. We don't throw for the memes, chat! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (6, 2):** Safe, but it gives him room to breathe. We want him gasping for air! \ud83d\udca8\n*   **DOWN (7, 1):** Safe! Moves us toward some apples in the bottom corner and keeps us mobile. \u2705\n*   **RIGHT (8, 2):** **ABSOLUTELY NOT!** His body is currently at (8, 2) and (9, 2). Even if he moves his head, his body segment at (8, 2) stays there this turn. That's an instant \"L\" in the chat. \u274c\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nChat, look at his head at (9, 3). If he moves LEFT to (8, 3), he\u2019s trying to escape. If he moves UP to (9, 4), he\u2019s hitting his own body! If we move **RIGHT**, we die. If we move **DOWN**, we stay alive and start baiting him into the bottom right corner where there are NO apples and NO space! \n\nWait, if I go **LEFT to (6, 2)**, I open up the middle of the board and prepare to sweep those apples at (4, 1) and (1, 1). If I go **DOWN to (7, 1)**, I\u2019m positioning to cut off his descent.\n\n**THE READ:**\nHe's stuck. His body is at (9,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4)... he has almost NO moves. He can go UP to (9,4)\u2014wait, (9,4) is empty, but he has body parts all over that area. If he goes LEFT to (8,3), he hits his own body. He is basically forced to go UP or die.\n\nWe are going **DOWN**. Why? Because it keeps us away from his messy body pile and positions us to grab the apples at (4,1) or (1,1) if this turns into a long game. We have the length to wall him off. \n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nWe are going to loop around the bottom. He\u2019s tangled in his own tail near (8, 4) and (7, 4). By moving DOWN, we clear the space for him to choke on his own segments while we stay flexible. If he head-butts us, we\u2019re at 12 apples\u2014it\u2019s a toss-up, but we\u2019re playing for the total wipeout! Stay focused, stay lethal! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nDOWN",

Board shows '.' at (9,5)? Actually board row 5 column 9 is '.' \u2705\n- LEFT to (8,4) \u2014 board shows 'T' (our body) \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u274c\n- DOWN to (9,3) \u2014 will be empty after we move? Actually our head leaves (9,3), but our body extends? Wait, we ate last turn so we grew \u2014 our tail didn't move this turn. Our body from last turn: head (9,3), then (9,2), (8,2), etc. After moving UP to (9,4), our new body: head (9,4), then (9,3), (9,2), (8,2)... So (9,3) becomes our neck \u2014 CAN'T GO BACK DOWN INTO IT NEXT TURN! So next turn from (9,4), only UP might be safe? That's a potential dead end! We need to avoid getting trapped!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** WE'RE ON THE RIGHT WALL WITH BODY BELOW AND LEFT. MUST BREAK OUT BY GOING UP AND THEN LEFT ASAP TO OPEN SPACE. ENEMY IS AT (7,2) WITH OPTIONS DOWN/LEFT. IF HE GOES LEFT TO (6,2), HE MOVES TOWARD CENTER. WE WANT TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES. AFTER (9,4), IF POSSIBLE, GO UP AGAIN TO (9,5) THEN LEFT TO (8,5) TO GET OFF THE WALL AND EXPAND OUR CONTROL. USE OUR LENGTH ADVANTAGE TO BLOCK HIM INTO THE BOTTOM-LEFT. FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION WHEN WE'RE LONGER!\n\n**VERDICT:**\nONLY ONE MOVE KEEPS US ALIVE \u2014 UP TO (9,4). TAKE IT AND LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER TURN! THEN WE MANEUVER TO FREEDOM. STAY ALERT, CHAT!

Snake #1 is literally hugging the right wall like his life depends on it (because it does!) while we are prowling the bottom sector! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**SITUATION RECON:**\n*   **Our Head:** (6, 1) \ud83d\udc0d\n*   **Enemy Head:** (9, 5) \ud83d\ude08\n*   **Our Body Check:** Our tail is at (0, 3). We are currently at (6, 1), with our neck behind us at (7, 1).\n\n**TENSION IS RISING! LET'S LOOK AT THE MOVES:**\n*   **RIGHT (7, 1):** **NOPE!** That's our neck! We aren't throwing for the highlights today! \u274c\n*   **UP (6, 2):** **DANGER!** Our body is at (6, 3). If we go UP to (6, 2), we're one tile away from our own spine and heading right into the enemy's territory. \u26a0\ufe0f\n*   **DOWN (6, 0):** **SAFE!** This takes us to the bottom edge. It's an okay play, but does it get us closer to the juice? \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **LEFT (5, 1):** **CLEAN!** This is the high-IQ play! It moves us directly toward that apple at (4, 1) and sets us up to sweep the bottom-left corner where (1, 1), (3, 0), and (0, 0) are just waiting to be harvested! \ud83d\udc8e\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (9, 5). He is absolutely cramped against that right wall! Look at his body\u2014it\u2019s a total mess between rows 2 and 5 on the right side. He HAS to keep moving up or he'll choke on his own tail. While he's struggling for air up there, we are going to dominate the bottom half of this map. \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are taking the LEFT lane. First stop: (5, 1), then (4, 1) for the snack. Once we secure that, we curve down to grab (3, 0) and (1, 1). We are building a massive \"wall\" across the bottom of the map. By the time he clears his self-made traffic jam on the right, we\u2019ll have a 3-4 point lead and the entire left side under our control! He\u2019s playing Snake, but we\u2019re playing Chess! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nWE STAY AGGRESSIVE. WE STAY HUNGRY. LET'S GET IT!\n\nLEFT",

LET'S BREAK IT DOWN!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (9,5):**\n- UP \u2192 (9,6) \u2192 Board shows '.' at row 6 col 9? Wait, the board grid shows row 6 col 9 is '.' (from legend: row 6 is \"6 . . . . . A . . A .\") \u2014 YES, EMPTY! \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,4) \u2192 That's our NECK! Our body list shows (9,4) is right behind head. \u274c DEATH \u2014 CAN'T GO BACKWARDS!\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 5 col 8 is '.' (row 5: \". . . T T T T . . 1\") \u2014 actually col 8 is '.' before the '1' at col 9. \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 OFF BOARD (10,5) \u274c DEATH.\n\nOKAY! WE HAVE **UP** AND **LEFT** AS SAFE MOVES! LET'S GOOO!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (6,1):**\nHis body: [(7,1), (7,2), (7,3), ...]. From (6,1):\n- UP \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 Board shows 'T'? Row 2 col 6 is '.'? Wait, row 2 is \"2 T T T . . . . T T T\" \u2014 col 6 is '.' \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 0 col 6 is '.' \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 Board shows 'A'? Row 1 col 5 is 'A' (from apple list? Actually board row 1: \". A . . A . 0 T . .\" \u2014 col 5 is '.'? Let's check: positions: col0 '.', col1 'A', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 'A', col5 '.', col6 '0', col7 'T', col8 '.', col9 '.'. So (5,1) is '.' \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 That's HIS OWN BODY (first body segment). \u274c DEATH.\n\nSO ENEMY HAS THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, LEFT. HE'S NOT TRAPPED.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (9,6), he can't reach that in one move. If we go LEFT to (8,5), he could theoretically go UP to (6,2) then... no, still two moves away. NO IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON POSSIBLE. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nWE NEED TO BOX HIM IN! HE'S IN THE BOTTOM LEFT (6,1). WE'RE ON THE RIGHT EDGE AT (9,5). OUR LONG BODY FORMS A BARRIER FROM (9,2) UP TO (3,5) \u2014 IT'S A WALL ACROSS THE MIDDLE! IF WE GO LEFT TO (8,5), WE EXTEND THAT BARRIER NORTHWARD AND START ENCIRCLING HIM FROM THE TOP. IF WE GO UP TO (9,6), WE STAY ON THE EDGE \u2014 THAT'S RISKY BECAUSE NEXT TURN FROM (9,6) WE'D ONLY HAVE LEFT (8,6) AND DOWN (9,5) \u2014 BUT DOWN IS OUR NECK THEN, SO ONLY LEFT AGAIN! THAT'S A TRAP \u2014 WE'D BE STUCK ON THE TOP-RIGHT CORNER!\n\nCHAT, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET STUCK AGAIN! GOING UP LEADS TO A DEAD-END! GOING LEFT OPENS THE BOARD \u2014 FROM (8,5) NEXT TURN WE CAN GO UP, LEFT, OR DOWN (DOWN would be (8,4) \u2014 that's our body? Wait, our body has (8,4) in it \u2014 YES, so DOWN would be unsafe next turn, but UP and LEFT likely safe). MORE OPTIONS!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nMOVE LEFT TO (8,5) \u2192 THEN HEAD TOWARD (7,5) \u2192 (6,5) TO CUT OFF THE ENEMY'S ESCAPE TO THE RIGHT. OUR BODY BLOCKS HIM FROM GOING UP PAST Y=3/4. WE WANT TO FORCE HIM INTO THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER AND THEN RISK A HEAD-ON COLLISION WHEN WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE (WE'RE TIED LENGTH NOW? BOTH 12 SEGMENTS? ACTUALLY BOTH HAVE 12 APPLES, SO SAME LENGTH). BUT WE CAN USE OUR POSITION TO TRAP HIM \u2014 IF HE GOES FOR APPLES IN THE BOTTOM LEFT, WE CAN ENCIRCLE. STAY AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**VERDICT:**  \nLEFT IS THE MOVE! KEEPS US FLEXIBLE AND PRESSURES THE ENEMY! UP IS A TRAP \u2014 DON'T DO IT! LET'S GO CHAT! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

We also have (1, 1), (3, 0), and (0, 0) in the vicinity.\n\n**THINKING OUT LOUD FOR THE CHAT:**\n*   **RIGHT (6, 1):** **NO!** That\u2019s our own body. We aren't here to self-destruct! \u274c\n*   **UP (5, 2):** **DANGEROUS!** If we go to (5, 2), we are heading straight toward our own body segment at (5, 3). If Snake #1 decides to dive down, we might get squeezed. Not the vibe! \u26a0\ufe0f\n*   **DOWN (5, 0):** **SITUATIONALLY OKAY.** It takes us to the bottom wall. But why go to the wall when there's food on the table? \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **LEFT (4, 1):** **THE WINNER!** This grabs the apple at (4, 1), boosts our score to 13, and keeps our momentum going toward the bottom-left corner. \ud83d\ude80\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (8, 5). Look at his body\u2014he\u2019s folded over himself like a lawn chair! He's occupying (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), and (4, 5). He is literally *boxed in by his own length* on that right side. He's going to have to loop around his own tail just to breathe!\n\nWe are going to secure the lead right now. By hitting LEFT to (4, 1), we go up by 1 point. After that, we can continue to (3, 1) or dip down to (3, 0). We are claiming the entire bottom-left quadrant. While he's fighting for his life in a 3x4 grid, we\u2019re out here living in a mansion! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure (4, 1). Next, we eye the (1, 1) and (0, 0) snacks. We are building a long, solid wall along the bottom to prevent him from ever coming back down here. If he wants to challenge us, he\u2019ll have to cross through the middle where we\u2019ll be waiting to cut him off! WE STAY FOCUSED. WE STAY COLD. \ud83e\uddca\n\nLEFT",

LET'S BREAK IT DOWN!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (8,5):**\n- UP \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 6 col 8 is '.' (row 6: \". . . . . A . . A .\" \u2014 col 8 is 'A'? Wait, check: col 0 '.', 1 '.', 2 '.', 3 '.', 4 '.', 5 'A', 6 '.', 7 '.', 8 'A', 9 '.'. So (8,6) is 'A' \u2014 APPLE! \u2705 Safe (eating apple grows us).\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,4) \u2192 That's OUR BODY! \u274c DEATH \u2014 can't go into ourselves!\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,5) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 5 col 7 is '.' (row 5: \". . .

SAFE MOVES: **UP** AND **LEFT**! LET'S GO!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (5,1):**\nHis body: [(6,1), (7,1), (7,2), ...]. From (5,1):\n- UP \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 Board shows 'T'? Row 2 col 5 is '.' (row 2: \"T T T . . . . T T T\" \u2014 col 5 is '.'). \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,0) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 0 col 5 is '.' \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 Board shows 'A'? Actually row 1 col 4 is 'A' (from apple list). \u2705 Safe (he could eat apple).\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 HIS OWN BODY! \u274c DEATH.\n\nSo enemy has UP, DOWN, LEFT safe. He might go for that apple at (4,1)!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (8,6), he can't reach us in one move. If we go LEFT to (7,5), he can't reach us either. NO IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nWE NEED TO TRAP HIM! He's in bottom left. Our body forms a wall across mid-board. If we go LEFT to (7,5), we move toward the center and can continue left to (6,5) to cut off his escape to the right side. BUT going UP to (8,6) gets us an APPLE \u2014 GROWTH to 13 segments, breaking the tie! That gives us length advantage for a potential head-on collision later! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nBut wait \u2014 if we eat the apple, our tail stays put? Actually, when you eat, you grow by 1 at the head, tail doesn't move. So our body gets longer, making our wall stronger! However, going UP might limit our next moves: from (8,6), next turn safe moves? UP (8,7) is '.'? Row 7 col 8 is '.' (row 7: \". . . A . . . A . .\" \u2014 col 8 is '.'). LEFT (7,6) is '.'? Row 6 col 7 is '.'. RIGHT (9,6) is off-board? Actually (9,6) is on board \u2014 row 6 col 9 is '.'? Yes, '.' So from (8,6) we'd have UP, LEFT, RIGHT possibly safe next turn \u2014 not trapped!\n\nGoing LEFT to (7,5) gives us similar options next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5) \u2014 but (6,5) is our body? Wait, our body has (6,5) in it! Yes, (6,5) is part of our tail! So LEFT next turn from (7,5) would be unsafe! So going LEFT now might reduce options later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEAT THAT APPLE AT (8,6)! Break the tie, get length advantage, then use our extra segment to tighten the noose around the enemy! From (8,6) we can move left toward (7,6) and then down/left to cut him off. With a longer body, we can risk a head-on collision if he tries to escape \u2014 we'd win because we'd be longer! This is the aggressive play chat wants! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**VERDICT:**\nUP gets the apple, breaks the tie, keeps options open. LEFT is safe but doesn't grow and might limit us next turn. WE GO FOR THE APPLE AND THE LEAD! LET'S GROW AND DOMINATE!\n\nUP",

Let's check current board: Row 1: \". A . . 0 T T T . .\" \u2014 col 4 is '0' (his head), col 1 is 'A'. So apple at (1,1) maybe? Anyway, from (4,1):\n- UP \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 Board shows '.'?

He might move toward bottom-left apples or try to wrap around our wall.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (8,7), he can't reach. LEFT to (7,6) \u2014 no. RIGHT to (9,6) \u2014 no. NO IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nWe have length advantage? Wait, both have 13 apples, same length. Our body forms a wall from (6,4) up to (9,3) etc. Enemy is trapped in bottom-left quadrant. We need to tighten the noose!\n\nFrom (8,6):\n- UP (8,7): moves us toward top-right, away from enemy \u2014 might give him space to escape upward later? But there's apples up there (7,7), (7,8), (7,9) etc. Could grow more.\n- LEFT (7,6): moves us closer to enemy, could go further left next turn to (6,6) or (6,5) \u2014 but (6,5) is our body! So left path may get blocked soon.\n- RIGHT (9,6): moves us to right edge, then maybe up along edge \u2014 but that could trap us in corner later.\n\nWe want to **box him in**! His possible escape routes: He could go UP to (4,2), then (4,3) is his body? Actually (4,3) is his body \u2014 yes, his body goes through (4,3). So he can't go up too far without hitting himself. He's kinda stuck! If we move LEFT to (7,6), we can next turn go DOWN to (7,5) \u2014 but (7,5) is our body? Wait, our body has (7,4) and (6,4) etc. (7,5) is free. Actually our body: (8,5), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So (7,5) is free! So from (7,6) we could go DOWN to (7,5), then LEFT to (6,5) \u2014 but (6,5) is our body! So careful.\n\nBetter plan: Go LEFT to (7,6) to get closer, then next turn maybe DOWN to (7,5) to threaten cutting off his rightward escape. Meanwhile, he might try to go left or down to avoid us.\n\nBut going UP gets us closer to apples for growth \u2014 more length = more advantage for head-on. But we risk letting him breathe.\n\nCHAT, I THINK AGGRESSION IS KEY! Let's move toward him and pressure! LEFT puts us in better position to cut off his escape to the right side of the board. With our wall already there, we can squeeze him into the bottom-left corner!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nFrom (7,6), aim to go DOWN to (7,5), then maybe LEFT to (6,5) \u2014 wait that's body, so maybe DOWN to (7,5) then DOWN to (7,4)? That's our body too. Hmm. Actually we need to slowly shift our wall leftward to trap him. Let's take LEFT now, then assess next turn.\n\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

He\u2019s practically wearing his own tail as a scarf right now! \ud83e\udde3\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**SITUATION RECON:**\n*   **Our Head:** (3, 1) \ud83d\udc0d\n*   **Enemy Head:** (7, 6) \ud83d\ude08 \n*   **The Board:** We are currently in the bottom-left quadrant. We've got plenty of space, but we need to be careful not to box ourselves against the bottom wall.\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n*   **RIGHT (4, 1):** **ABSOLUTELY NOT!** That is our own neck, chat! We aren't trying to ends the stream early with a self-collision! \u274c\n*   **UP (3, 2):** **DEATH TRAP!** Look at our body at (3, 3), (2, 3), (4, 3)... if we go UP to (3, 2), we are literally swimming into a U-bend of our own making. We\u2019d be stuck in a 1-wide gap. That's a \"No-Go\" zone! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **LEFT (2, 1):** **VIABLE.** This keeps us moving toward the (1, 1) apple. It's a solid backup, but let's look at the alternatives.\n*   **DOWN (3, 0):** **THE BIG BRAIN PLAY!** Yo, there is an apple sitting RIGHT at (3, 0)! If we take it now, we grow to 14, take the lead, and keep our momentum moving along the bottom edge. From (3, 0), we can then slide LEFT toward (1, 1) and (0, 0). \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca8\n\n**THE ART OF WAR:**\nSnake #1 is at (7, 6). He is tangled. If he tries to come down to contest our space, he has to navigate through (6, 5) and (5, 5) which are already occupied by his own segments. He is slow, he is clunky, and he is losing board control! While he\u2019s playing \"Don't Break Your Own Neck,\" we\u2019re out here FEASTING. \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe grab the apple at (3, 0) this turn. Next, we pivot LEFT to grab (1, 1) and (0, 0). Once we've cleared the bottom-left, we'll have enough length to create a massive horizontal wall across the y=1 or y=2 line, effectively cutting the board in half and trapping his head in the top-right chaos. Stay focused, stay hungry, and let's get that W! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nDOWN",

WE JUST MOVED LEFT TO (7,6) LAST TURN \u2014 GOOD PRESSURE! NOW WE GOTTA KEEP THE HEAT ON!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (7,6):**\n- UP \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 Board shows 'A'? Row 7 col 7 is 'A' (apple at (7,7) from list). That\u2019s an apple! But is it safe? Check if any snake body there: board shows '.' at (7,7) in the ASCII? Wait row 7: \". . . A A . . A . .\" \u2014 col 7 is 'A' (yes apple). No body there. \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 5 col 7 is '.' (row 5: \". . . . . T T . T T\" \u2014 col 7 is '.'). \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 6 col 6 is '.' (row 6: \". . . . . A . 1 T .\" \u2014 col 6 is '.'). \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 That\u2019s OUR BODY! \u274c DEATH \u2014 our neck from last turn! Can't go back.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN, LEFT**! NO RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (3,1):** He just moved? Last turn he was at (4,1), now at (3,1) \u2014 so he moved LEFT. From (3,1):\n- UP \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 2 col 3 is '.' (row 2: \"T T T . . . . T T T\" \u2014 col 3 is '.'). \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,0) \u2192 Board shows 'A'? Row 0 col 3 is 'A' (apple). \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 1 col 2 is '.' (row 1: \". A . . 0 T T T . .\" \u2014 col 2 is '.'). \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 That\u2019s HIS BODY! \u274c DEATH.\n\nSo enemy has UP, DOWN, LEFT safe. He might go for apple at (3,0) DOWN or (1,1) later.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (7,7), he can\u2019t reach. DOWN to (7,5) \u2014 no. LEFT to (6,6) \u2014 no. So no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe have a wall of our body along right side and middle. Enemy is trapped bottom-left. We need to tighten the noose! If we go LEFT to (6,6), we move closer to him and block his potential escape upward through the middle. From (6,6) next turn we could go DOWN to (6,5) \u2014 but (6,5) is our body! So that\u2019s risky. Actually our body: (6,5) is our segment. So LEFT might limit our next moves.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (7,5), we stay closer to our body wall and maybe cut off his rightward path if he tries to go up later. From (7,5) next turn we could go LEFT to (6,5) \u2014 body again, or DOWN to (7,4) \u2014 body, or RIGHT to (8,5) \u2014 body. Hmm, DOWN might trap us.\n\nIf we go UP to (7,7), we eat apple (7,7) \u2014 GROW to length 14, now we have length advantage! That means if we get head-on collision later, WE WIN! Also eating apple gives us more board control. But does it give enemy space? Maybe, but we can still pressure from above.\n\nCHAT, LET'S THINK \u2014 AGGRESSION IS GOOD, BUT LENGTH ADVANTAGE IS HUGE! With longer body, we can afford riskier head-on later. Also apple at (7,7) is free! Enemy can't reach it this turn. Going UP also keeps multiple options open: from (7,7) we can go LEFT to (6,7), UP to (7,8), or RIGHT to (8,7) \u2014 all likely safe next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nEat apple at (7,7) \u2192 grow to 14. Then move to cut off enemy\u2019s upward escape by shifting our wall left/down. Enemy likely will go for apple at (3,0) or (1,1). We can slowly encircle him from the north and east. With length advantage, we can force head-on if he tries to break out!\n\nUP gives us growth, keeps options open, and pressures from above. LEFT risks getting stuck near our own body. DOWN also limits next moves.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** GO FOR THE APPLE AND THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! UP!\n\nUP",

Our rival is tangled up in the top right like a ball of yarn, and we are holding down the bottom floor!\n\n**SITUATION RECON:**\n*   **Our Head:** (3, 0) \ud83d\udc0d\n*   **Enemy Head:** (7, 7) \ud83d\ude08 \n*   **The Board:** We are hugging the bottom wall at y=0. Let's look at our options!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n*   **RIGHT (4, 0):** **VIABLE.** It keeps us moving along the wall. But wait, look at the body! Our tail is trailing behind us at (1, 2). If we go right, we are just stalling.\n*   **DOWN (3, -1):** **INSTANT DEATH!** We aren't trying to fall off the face of the earth, chat! Stay on the board! \u274c\n*   **UP (3, 1):** **SUICIDE!** That's our own neck! We literally just came from there! Don't be a scrub! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **LEFT (2, 0):** **THE PRO MOVE!** Look at the map, chat! There's an apple at (0, 0) and (1, 1). By moving LEFT to (2, 0), we are carving out the bottom-left corner for ourselves. \n\n**THE ART OF WAR:**\nSnake #1 is at (7, 7). He's currently trying to navigate his own mess at (7, 6), (8, 6), and (8, 5). He is cramped! While he's suffocating in his own coils, we are going to sweep the bottom-left field. If we grab (1, 1) and (0, 0), we move to 16 apples and take a COMMANDING lead. \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe go LEFT to (2, 0) now. Next turn, we hit (1, 0), then we can loop UP to grab the apple at (1, 1) or keep sliding to (0, 0). Once we have the bottom-left corner locked down, we\u2019ll have a Massive tail that we can use to wall off the entire bottom half of the board. If he tries to come down to stop us, he'll have to cross through the middle where we can force a head-on collision since we'll have the score lead! LET'S GET IT! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nLEFT",

WE JUST ATE THAT APPLE AND GREW TO 14 \u2014 LENGTH ADVANTAGE SECURED! NOW WE GOTTA USE IT TO BOX HIM IN!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (7,7):**\n- UP \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 8 col 7 is '.' (row 8: \". . . A . A . A . A\" \u2014 col 7 is '.'). \u2705 Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 That's OUR BODY! \u274c DEATH \u2014 our neck from last turn! Can't go back.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 7 col 6 is '.' (row 7: \"A . . A A . . 1 . .\" \u2014 col 6 is '.'). \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 Board shows '.'? Row 7 col 8 is '.' (row 7: \"A . . A A . . 1 . .\" \u2014 col 8 is '.'). \u2705 Safe.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**!

A .\" \u2014 col 4 is '.'). \u2705 Safe.\n\nSo enemy only has LEFT or RIGHT safe. He's trapped against the bottom wall! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (7,8), he can't reach. LEFT to (6,7) \u2014 no. RIGHT to (8,7) \u2014 no. So no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe have a MASSIVE body wall along the right and center. Enemy is stuck bottom-left with only two moves: LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0). If he goes RIGHT to (4,0), he's moving toward our body wall. If he goes LEFT to (2,0), he's going toward the corner. Either way, we can slowly close the net!\n\nWe want to position our head to cut off his potential escape upward. From (7,7), going LEFT to (6,7) moves us closer to him and blocks the column 6 path. Going RIGHT to (8,7) moves us away \u2014 not ideal. Going UP to (7,8) keeps us high but maybe less direct pressure.\n\nBUT CHAT, THINK LONG-TERM! With our length advantage, we can afford to be aggressive and force a head-on collision if he tries to break out! If we go LEFT to (6,7), next turn we could go DOWN to (6,6) \u2014 but (6,6) is our body? Wait, check: our body list shows (7,6) is our neck, (8,6), (8,5)... (6,6) is NOT in our body! Actually board row 6 col 6 is '.' \u2014 so (6,6) is free! So from (6,7) we could go DOWN to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6) \u2014 which is an apple! That's a path to grow more and squeeze him!\n\nGoing UP to (7,8) gives us options to go LEFT to (6,8) or RIGHT to (8,8) \u2014 both open. But that's moving away from the fight.\n\nWE NEED TO TIGHTEN THE NOOSE! LEFT puts us in a better position to cut off his upward escape through the middle. Enemy might try to go RIGHT to (4,0), then UP to (4,1) \u2014 but (4,1) is his body! So he can't. He's really trapped. We can slowly move down and left to seal his fate.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** GO LEFT TO (6,7) \u2014 DIRECT PRESSURE, BLOCK ESCAPE ROUTES, AND SET UP FOR NEXT TURN TO MOVE DOWN TOWARD THE APPLE AT (5,6) OR FURTHER ENCIRCLE! LET'S END HIM! \ud83d\udc80\n\nLEFT",

So col 5 is '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 That's OUR NECK! Body list: head (6,7), then (7,7) is next \u2014 \u274c DEATH, CAN'T GO BACK INTO OUR BODY.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN, LEFT** \u2014 NO RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (2,0):** Last turn he was at (3,0) with only LEFT or RIGHT safe. He chose LEFT to (2,0) (since he's now at (2,0)). From (2,0):\n- UP \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 Board row 1 col 2? Row 1: \". A .

He might try to break upward!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (6,8), he can't reach. DOWN to (6,6) \u2014 no. LEFT to (5,7) \u2014 no. So no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe have a HUGE body wall on the right side. Enemy is bottom-left with limited moves. If he goes UP to (2,1), he's moving toward more open space \u2014 we need to cut him off! If we go LEFT to (5,7), we're moving horizontally closer but not directly blocking his upward path. If we go DOWN to (6,6), we're moving toward the apple at (5,6) \u2014 that's content and growth! But also positions us to maybe cut off his rightward escape later.\n\nActually, think: If enemy goes UP to (2,1), next turn he could go UP again to (2,2) \u2014 but (2,2) is his own body! \u274c So he can't. So his upward escape is limited. He's still trapped.\n\nBut we have a length advantage \u2014 we should use it to dominate the board and maybe force a head-on if he tries to break out. Going DOWN to (6,6) sets us up to go LEFT to (5,6) (APPLE!) next turn, growing to 15 and extending our body wall. That also moves us closer to him horizontally.\n\nGoing UP to (6,8) feels like we're retreating from the pressure \u2014 not aggressive enough!\n\nGoing LEFT to (5,7) is fine but doesn't progress toward apple or tightening the noose as directly.\n\n**BEST MOVE: DOWN to (6,6)** \u2014 gets us closer to the apple at (5,6), maintains multiple options (next turn from (6,6): LEFT to apple, UP back to (6,7), DOWN to (6,5) but (6,5) is our body? Check body: (6,5) is in our body list! \u274c So DOWN next turn not safe. But LEFT and UP are safe. Still okay.\n\nWe stay aggressive, we go for growth, and we keep him cornered! LET'S GO FOR THE APPLE AND EXTEND OUR LEAD! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (6,6), if apple at (5,6) still there, GO LEFT to eat it and grow! That extends our body further left, blocking enemy's potential rightward escape. Then continue pressing him toward the corner. If he goes UP to (2,1), we can consider moving down-left to seal the bottom. Use our length to control the center!\n\nDOWN",

We have 14 apples, the rival has 14 apples\u2014it\u2019s a dead heat for the crown, but look at the board! We are positioned at (1, 0), and we are about to secure the bag!\n\n**SITUATION ROOM:**\n*   **Our Head:** (1, 0)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (6, 6)\n*   **The Enemy:** Snake #1 is currently coiled up at (6, 6). He\u2019s trying to navigate through a mess of his own body segments between rows 2 and 7. He's slow, he's clunky, and he's vulnerable!\n\n**THE MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP (1, 1):** **JUICY!** There is an apple at (1, 1). However, if we go UP, we are entering a tiny pocket between our body at (1, 0) and (2, 0). It\u2019s safe for one turn, but we want to maintain board control!\n*   **DOWN (1, -1):** **ABSOLUTELY NOT!** We don't go out of bounds on this channel. Chat, don't even suggest it! \ud83d\udcc9\n*   **RIGHT (2, 0):** **RIOT!** That is our own body. We aren't trying to eat ourselves today! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (0, 0):** **THE MEGA PLAY!** There is an apple sitting right there at (0, 0). By moving LEFT, we grab that point, move to 15 apples, and we hit the corner perfectly.\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe take (0, 0) this turn to take the lead (15-14)! After that, we are going to climb the left wall like a ladder. Look at the apples waiting for us: (0, 7) and (0, 9) are just sitting there! While the rival is stuck in the \"Snake Pit\" he built for himself on the right side, we are going to loop around the top and start constricting the center of the board. \n\nHe\u2019s got no room to breathe, chat! If he tries to come toward the bottom-left, he has to cross our massive tail. We are playing CHESS, he is playing checkers! Let's get that 15th apple and stay alive! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc8e\n\nLEFT",

Body list: (7,7), (7,6) is in there \u2014 \u274c DEATH.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **DOWN, LEFT** \u2014 NO UP OR RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (1,0):** Last turn he was at (2,0) and moved LEFT to (1,0). From (1,0):\n- UP \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 APPLE at (1,1)! Board row 1 col 1? Row 1: \". A .

He's gonna grow next turn for sure. \ud83d\ude24\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go LEFT to (5,6), he can't reach. If we go DOWN to (6,5), he can't reach. So no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe need to grow AND block his escape! If he eats an apple, he grows by 1, but we can still outmaneuver him.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,6) \u2014 WE EAT THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We grow to 15, score 15-14 lead! Our new head at (5,6), new tail stays? Actually growth means our tail stays put, so our body extends. That extends our wall further left, blocking his potential path upward/rightward. From (5,6) next turn, we can go DOWN to (5,5) (open?), LEFT to (4,6), or UP to (5,7) \u2014 multiple options.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (6,5) \u2014 no apple, we stay 14. Then next turn from (6,5) we have LEFT to (5,5) (maybe open), DOWN to (6,4) (our body? check: (6,4) is in our body \u2014 \u274c), UP back to (6,6) (neck? from (6,5) going UP to (6,6) would be into our current head position \u2014 but after moving, (6,6) becomes our neck? Actually after moving DOWN, our body shifts: head to (6,5), old head (6,6) becomes neck. So UP from (6,5) to (6,6) would be into our own neck \u2014 \u274c DEATH next turn). So DOWN now leaves us with only LEFT next turn \u2014 THAT'S A TRAP! \ud83d\ude31\n\nCHAT, GOING DOWN TO (6,5) IS A DEAD END NEXT TURN! Only LEFT would be safe, and if that's blocked later, we're cooked!\n\n**BEST MOVE: LEFT to (5,6)** \u2014 EAT THE APPLE, TAKE THE LEAD, EXTEND OUR BODY, AND KEEP OPTIONS OPEN! From (5,6) next turn we have DOWN (5,5), LEFT (4,6), UP (5,7) \u2014 all potentially safe depending on board. We stay aggressive, we grow, we dominate! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating apple at (5,6), we should press toward enemy's area. He'll likely eat an apple too (either (1,1) or (0,0)), tying us at 15-15. We need to use our longer body to cut off his escape routes. Consider moving DOWN/LEFT to control bottom-left, or UP to threaten his upward path. Watch for head-on risks if he moves toward center.\n\nLEFT",

It is a dead heat, but look at the positioning! Our rival is tangled up like a ball of yarn at (5, 6), and we have the entire left flank wide open for the taking!\n\n**SITUATION ROOM:**\n*   **Our Head:** (0, 0) - Nestled in the corner, ready to climb!\n*   **Our Body:** (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)... we are stretched out along the bottom wall.\n*   **Enemy Head:** (5, 6) - He\u2019s hovering in the mid-upper right.\n*   **The Danger:** We are at (0, 0). Let's look at our options!\n\n**THE MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **DOWN:** Out of bounds! We aren't trying to fall off the face of the earth! \ud83d\udcc9\n*   **LEFT:** Out of bounds!

Since UP is our only legal move, we aren't just moving\u2014we're *positioning*. We are going to hug this left wall. Look at the rival; he's trapped himself in a zig-zag at (5, 6). He starts at (5, 6) and his body is a mess of coils from (6, 4) to (9, 5). He has very little room to maneuver without cutting himself off!\n\nBy heading UP, we reach (0, 1). Next turn, we keep climbing. We are going to secure the entire left side of the board. If he tries to come over here to contest us, he has to cross the middle, and we'll be ready to box him in against the edges! We have 116 turns left\u2014this is a marathon, not a sprint, but we are winning the positioning battle! \n\nLet\u2019s get vertical! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

WE JUST ATE THAT APPLE AT (5,6) LAST TURN \u2014 GOOD, WE'RE GROWING AND TIED! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (5,6):**\n- UP \u2192 (5,7) \u2192 Check board row 7: \"A . . A A A T T . .\" \u2014 col 5 is 'A' \u2705 APPLE CELL, not occupied by any snake body? Wait, our body list: we have (6,6) as neck, then (6,7), (7,7), etc. (5,7) is NOT in our body. Enemy body? Enemy body list ends at (2,3). So (5,7) is safe and has an apple! \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 Board row 5: \". . . . . . . . T T\" \u2014 col 5 is '.' \u2705 SAFE, not in our body (our body includes (6,4), (7,4), etc., not (5,5)).\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 Board row 6: \". . . . . 1 T T T .\" \u2014 col 4 is '.' \u2705 SAFE, not in our body.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 That's our NECK! Body list: head (5,6), then (6,6) next \u2014 \u274c DEATH, CAN'T GO BACKWARDS.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN, LEFT** \u2014 NO RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (0,0):** Last turn he was at (1,0) and moved LEFT to (0,0) eating the apple there! So he grew, now length 16. From (0,0):\n- UP \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 Board row 1: \". A . T T T T T . .\" \u2014 col 0 is '.' \u2705 SAFE (not in his body? His body: (1,0),(2,0),...,(2,3). (0,1) not in list).\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,-1) \u274c OFF BOARD.\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,0) \u274c OFF BOARD.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 That's his NECK! Body list: head (0,0), then (1,0) next \u2014 \u274c DEATH.\n\nSo enemy only safe move is **UP to (0,1)**. He's forced! That means next turn his head will be at (0,1).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go LEFT to (4,6), he's at (0,0) moving to (0,1) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (5,5), same.\nIf we go UP to (5,7), same.\nSo no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe need to trap him in the bottom-left corner! He's forced upward along the left wall. If we move to cut off his escape routes, we can force a crash.\n\nLook at the board: Our body forms a wall along right side and top-center. Enemy is at (0,0) moving to (0,1). If we go UP to (5,7) we eat an apple, grow to 16, and our head moves closer to top-left? Actually (5,7) is middle-top. That doesn't directly block him.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,6), we move closer to left side, maybe cut off his path to the right. But we don't grow.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,5), we move toward bottom, but he's moving up, so maybe not directly blocking.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:**\nFrom (5,7) after eating apple: next turn safe moves? UP to (5,8) \u2014 apple there? Board row 8 col 5 is 'A' \u2705 likely safe. DOWN back to (5,6) \u2014 would be neck? After moving, (5,6) becomes neck, so DOWN would be death next turn. LEFT to (4,7) \u2014 maybe safe? RIGHT to (6,7) \u2014 our body? (6,7) is in our body list as second segment \u2014 after moving, (6,7) becomes third segment? Actually after moving UP, our body shifts: new head (5,7), old head (5,6) becomes neck, old neck (6,6) becomes second, etc. So (6,7) is still in our body (it was (6,7) before, becomes (6,7) still? Wait, segment positions shift: tail stays, each segment moves forward. So (6,7) will become the position of the old (6,6)? Actually let's simulate: current body: head (5,6), then (6,6),(6,7),(7,7),... If we move UP to (5,7), new body: head (5,7), then (5,6),(6,6),(6,7),... So (6,7) becomes fourth segment. So RIGHT to (6,7) would be into our own body \u2014 \u274c death. So from (5,7) next turn, UP and LEFT likely safe, DOWN and RIGHT unsafe. That's two options.\n\nFrom (4,6) no apple: next turn safe moves? UP to (4,7) \u2014 apple? Board row 7 col 4 is 'A' \u2705 safe. DOWN to (4,5) \u2014 '.' safe. LEFT to (3,6) \u2014 '.' safe? Board row 6 col 3 is '.' \u2705. RIGHT back to (5,6) \u2014 neck? After moving LEFT, (5,6) becomes neck, so RIGHT would be death. So three options next turn! That's more flexibility.\n\nFrom (5,5) no apple: next turn safe moves? UP back to (5,6) \u2014 neck, death. DOWN to (5,4) \u2014 board row 4 col 5 is '.' but our body? Our body has (6,4),(7,4), etc. (5,4) is not in body \u2705 safe. LEFT to (4,5) \u2014 '.' safe. RIGHT to (6,5) \u2014 our body? (6,5) is not in current body, but after moving, (6,5) will be? Actually after moving DOWN to (5,5), body shifts: head (5,5), neck (5,6), then (6,6), etc. So (6,5) is free. So three options too.\n\n**LONG-TERM TRAP:**\nEnemy forced to (0,1). We want to cut off his escape to the right. If we go LEFT to (4,6), we're closer to left wall. Next turn we can go UP to (4,7) eating apple, then left to (3,7) etc., building a wall above him. He'll be forced up along column 0, maybe to (0,2),(0,3). We can then move to (3,6),(2,6) etc., blocking his rightward exits.\n\nGoing UP to (5,7) eats apple but stays central, not directly boxing him.\n\nGoing DOWN to (5,5) moves away from him, giving him space.\n\n**BEST MOVE: LEFT to (4,6)** \u2014 NO APPLE BUT POSITIONAL DOMINANCE! We keep our length tied 15-15, but we get better board control. Next turn we can eat apple at (4,7) or (3,6) etc., while he's stuck on left edge. We can start building a wall from (4,6) leftward and upward to trap him! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nCHAT, WE'RE PLAYING THE LONG GAME \u2014 BOX HIM IN AND WATCH HIM CRASH! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Because it\u2019s an immediate point, it puts us in the lead, and it keeps our momentum moving toward the center-left where we can eventually pivot back UP to grab those berries at (3, 7) and (4, 7). \n\nOur rival at (4, 6) is probably going to try and loop around his own tail or push toward the top right. If we take (1, 1) now, we occupy a central-ish lane that prevents him from easily swinging down to the bottom left. We are building a wall, chat! We are the architects of his demise! \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\n\nLet's grab that apple and show them why we're the GOAT of Snake!\n\nRIGHT",

So (4,7) is SAFE and has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 Board row 5: \". . . . . . . .

Body list: head (4,6), then (5,6) next \u2014 \u274c DEATH, CAN'T GO BACKWARDS.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN, LEFT** \u2014 NO RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (0,1):** Last turn he was forced UP to (0,1). From (0,1):\n- UP \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 Board row 2: \". . . . . . . T T T\" \u2014 col 0 is '.' \u2705 SAFE (not in his body).\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,0) \u2192 That's his NECK! Body: head (0,1), then (0,0) next \u2014 \u274c DEATH.\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,1) \u274c OFF BOARD.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 Board row 1 col 1 is 'A' \u2014 apple! But is it safe? His body includes (1,0),(2,0), etc. (1,1) NOT in his body \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSo enemy has TWO safe moves: UP to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,1). He might go for the apple at (1,1) to grow and tie-break! Or he might go UP along the wall.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (4,7), he's at (0,1) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (4,5), no collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (3,6), no collision.\nSo no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN CONTINUED:**\nWe want to trap him in the left column! He's at (0,1). If he goes RIGHT to (1,1), he eats an apple and grows to 16 \u2014 then he's more dangerous. If he goes UP to (0,2), he stays length 15 but moves up the wall.\n\nWe should CUT OFF his escape to the right! Our body already forms a wall along column 7-9. If we move LEFT to (3,6), we get closer to blocking column 3-6 above him. But going UP to (4,7) eats an apple, grows us to 16 \u2014 TIE-BREAKER! If we grow and he doesn't, we have length advantage for head-on collisions! That's HUGE!\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:**\nFrom (4,7) after eating apple (length 16): next turn safe moves? UP to (4,8) \u2014 apple? Board row 8 col 4 is '.' but safe? Our new body will have old head (4,6) as neck, so (4,8) free. DOWN back to (4,6) \u2014 would be neck? After moving, (4,6) becomes neck, so DOWN would be death next turn. LEFT to (3,7) \u2014 apple? Board row 7 col 3 is 'A' \u2705 safe. RIGHT to (5,7) \u2014 our body? After moving, (5,7) will be? Actually current body: (4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7)... After UP, new body: (4,7),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)... So (5,7) is free? Wait, (5,7) is currently an apple, not in body. After move, still free. So from (4,7), UP, LEFT, RIGHT likely safe, DOWN unsafe. Three options!\n\nFrom (3,6) no apple (length 15): next turn safe moves? UP to (3,7) \u2014 apple \u2705 safe. DOWN to (3,5) \u2014 '.' safe. LEFT to (2,6) \u2014 '.' safe. RIGHT back to (4,6) \u2014 neck, death. So three options too.\n\nFrom (4,5) no apple (length 15): next turn safe moves? UP back to (4,6) \u2014 neck, death. DOWN to (4,4) \u2014 board row 4 col 4 is '.' safe? Our body has (7,4) etc., (4,4) free. LEFT to (3,5) \u2014 '.' safe. RIGHT to (5,5) \u2014 '.' safe. So three options.\n\n**LENGTH ADVANTAGE DECISION:**\nIf we eat the apple at (4,7), we grow to 16, he might stay at 15 if he goes UP. If he goes RIGHT and eats (1,1), he also grows to 16 \u2014 then tied length. But if we both grow, still tied. However, if we grow and he doesn't, we have the advantage! That's worth it!\n\nAlso, (4,7) is closer to building a wall above him. From there we can go LEFT to (3,7) (another apple!) and then down/left to seal him off.\n\n**CHAT, THE MOVE IS CLEAR: GO UP TO (4,7), EAT THAT APPLE, AND TAKE THE LENGTH LEAD!** Then we press the attack and box him in! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (4,7), assess enemy position. If he's at (0,2), we can move LEFT to (3,7) (apple) to continue wall-building. If he's at (1,1), we might need to intercept. Priority: maintain length advantage, cut off his rightward escape, force him into the corner!\n\nUP",

He's way up there, basically doing donuts around his own tail. He's got a mess of body segments from (4, 6) down through (9, 2). He is TANGLED, chat!\n*   **Our Body:** We have a solid foundation. Our tail is at (3, 3), and we've got a long trail coming from (0, 1), (0, 0), and along the bottom. We are basically a wall!\n\n**MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n*   **LEFT:** (0, 1) - **STOP!** That's our own body! We'd be hitting ourselves! We are NOT throwing the game for the clips! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **DOWN:** (1, 0) - **DENIED!** Our body is chilling there. Instant RIP. \ud83d\uded1\n*   **RIGHT:** (2, 1) - This is wide open space!

It starts our path toward that massive cluster of apples in the top-left (0, 7), (0, 9), (3, 7). \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4f\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nLook at the board, chat! The opponent is at (4, 7). If we go **UP**, we start reclaiming the left side of the board. The area around (1, 2), (2, 2), (1, 3) is completely empty. If we go RIGHT, we are just hovering near our own tail at (3, 1) and (4, 1). \n\nWe need to head north! There are FIVE apples sitting in the top left corner waiting for a king to claim them! By moving **UP** to (1, 2), we stay away from the enemy's chaotic body mass on the right and position ourselves to intercept any attempt he makes to swing left. We are playing the long game. We are going to get big, get thick, and then we are going to wrap around him like a blanket! \ud83e\udde3\n\nLet's get those gains!\n\nUP",

From (1,1):\n- UP \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 Board row 2: \". . . . . . . T T T\" \u2014 col 1 is '.' \u2705 SAFE (not in his body).\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 That's his body? His body: head (1,1), then (0,1),(0,0),(1,0)... Wait, his body list: [(0,1),(0,0),(1,0),(2,0)...] So (1,0) is his 3rd segment \u2014 \u274c DEATH, can't go into own body.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 That's his NECK! \u274c DEATH.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 Board row 1 col 2 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? His body includes (2,0),(3,0)... (2,1) not in his body. SAFE.\n\nSo enemy has TWO safe moves: UP to (1,2) or RIGHT to (2,1). He might go UP along wall or RIGHT into more open space.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (4,8), he's at (1,1) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (3,7), no collision.\nIf we go RIGHT to (5,7), no collision.\nSo no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe want to trap him in the bottom-left! He's at (1,1). If he goes RIGHT to (2,1), he moves toward center. If he goes UP to (1,2), he goes up the wall. Our body wall is on the right side (columns 7-9). We need to extend a wall downward from our position to cut off his escape to the right!\n\nLook at the board: Our body forms a C-shape from (4,6) up to (9,3) etc. If we go LEFT to (3,7) and eat that apple, we grow to 17, extending our body leftward, blocking column 3 above him. If we go RIGHT to (5,7) and eat that apple, we grow to 17, but we move rightward, away from trapping him. If we go UP to (4,8), we don't grow, stay length 16, but we move up, maybe to later go left.\n\n**LENGTH ADVANTAGE DECISION:**\nIf we eat an apple, we grow to 17, he stays at 16 (unless he eats an apple next turn, but he has no apple in his immediate moves). That's a HUGE advantage! With length lead, we can force head-on collisions and win! So we should EAT AN APPLE THIS TURN!\n\nWhich apple? LEFT (3,7) or RIGHT (5,7)? LEFT puts us closer to him, better for boxing in. RIGHT moves us away. So LEFT is AGGRESSIVE and GROWS and BLOCKS!\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:**\nFrom (3,7) after eating apple (length 17): next turn safe moves? UP to (3,8) \u2014 apple? Board row 8 col 3 is 'A' \u2705 safe? Our new body will have old head (4,7) as neck, so (3,8) free. DOWN to (3,6) \u2014 currently '.' safe? After move, (3,6) will be free? Our body will have (4,6) but not (3,6). LEFT to (2,7) \u2014 apple? Board row 7 col 2 is 'A' \u2705 safe. RIGHT back to (4,7) \u2014 neck, death. So three options, all good, and two more apples!\n\nFrom (5,7) after eating apple (length 17): next turn safe moves? UP to (5,8) \u2014 apple? Board row 8 col 5 is 'A' \u2705 safe.

RIGHT to (6,7) \u2014 our body? Current body has (6,7) as segment? Actually current body: (4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7)... After move, (6,7) might be free? Let's check: new body: (5,7),(4,7),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7)... (6,7) is 6th segment \u2014 still in body! So (6,7) is UNSAFE. So from (5,7), only UP might be safe? Actually UP is only safe move? That's a TRAP! Going RIGHT to (5,7) limits our next moves severely! \u274c\n\nFrom (4,8) no apple (length 16): next turn safe moves? UP to (4,9) \u2014 apple? Board row 9 col 4 is '.' safe. DOWN back to (4,7) \u2014 neck, death. LEFT to (3,8) \u2014 apple \u2705 safe. RIGHT to (5,8) \u2014 apple \u2705 safe. So three options.\n\n**CHAT, THE MOVE IS CLEAR: GO LEFT TO (3,7), EAT THAT APPLE, GROW TO 17, AND PRESS HIM AGAINST THE WALL!** This extends our body leftward, blocks his potential upward escape along column 3, and sets up a deadly wall! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (3,7), assess enemy position. If he's at (1,2), we can go DOWN to (3,6) to continue sealing the left side. If he's at (2,1), we might go LEFT to (2,7) (apple) to further extend the wall.

We are sitting at (1, 2) and the board is starting to look like a geometric masterpiece. We are down by ONE apple (16 to 17), but look at the positioning! Our rival is tangled up in his own spaghetti at (3, 7)! It's time to capitalize!\n\n**SCANNING THE PERIMETER:**\n*   **UP (1, 3):** This is the move, chat! It\u2019s wide open space. It moves us further away from our own tail and puts us on a direct path to those juiced-up apples at (0, 7) and (2, 7). We are reclaiming the west side of the board! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n*   **DOWN (1, 1):** RIP. That's our own body. We just came from there. Instant clip of us throwing the game. NOPE! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (0, 2):** Clear, but it puts us against the wall early. We want to keep our options open in the middle-left. \ud83e\uddf1\n*   **RIGHT (2, 2):** Also safe, but it's moving us toward the enemy's massive body wall on the right side. Why go toward the traffic jam? \ud83d\udea6\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (3, 7). He's likely going to try to grab that apple at (2, 7) or (0, 7) himself. If we go **UP** now, we are positioning ourselves to either beat him to those apples or, even better, CUT HIM OFF. Imagine the clip, chat: he tries to swing left, and we are there like a Great Wall! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nOur body is currently a solid line from (1, 1) down to the bottom and along the floor. We are basically controlling the bottom-left quadrant. By moving UP, we expand our territory and keep our tail moving. We need to stay fluid. We aren't just playing Snake; we're playing 4D Chess! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe go UP. Next few turns, we're looking at (1, 4) and (1, 5) to secure the left flank. If he tries to descend, we box him against his own tail! Let's get that lead back!\n\nUP",

Our body has (4,6) but NOT (3,6). Enemy body no. SAFE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 Board row 7 col 2 is 'A' \u2705 APPLE CELL! Safe? Our body no. Enemy body no. SAFE and GROW!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 That's our NECK! \u274c DEATH, CAN'T GO BACKWARDS.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN, LEFT** \u2014 NO RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (1,2):** He just moved UP to (1,2). From (1,2):\n- UP \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 Board row 3 col 1 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? His body: head (1,2), then (1,1),(0,1)... (1,3) not in his body. SAFE.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 That's his NECK! \u274c DEATH.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 Board row 2 col 0 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in his body. SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 Board row 2 col 2 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in his body. SAFE.\n\nHe has THREE safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. He's trapped near the wall, likely trying to avoid us.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (3,8), he could go RIGHT to (2,2) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (3,6), he's at (1,2) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (2,7), no collision.\nSo no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe have length advantage! 17 vs 16. We can afford to be AGGRESSIVE and force him into a corner! Look at the board \u2014 our massive body wall runs down the right side (columns 4-9). He's stuck in the bottom-left quadrant. We need to seal the top and left to complete the trap!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,7) and eat that apple, we grow to 18, extending our wall leftward along row 7, blocking his potential upward escape through columns 2-3. That's PRESSURE!\n\nIf we go UP to (3,8) and eat that apple, we grow to 18, but we move upward away from him, giving him room to breathe. Not as aggressive.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,6), we don't grow, stay at 17, but we move closer to him, maybe to cut off his rightward escape next turn.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:**\nFrom (2,7) after eating apple (length 18):\n- Next turn safe moves? UP to (2,8) \u2014 '.' safe. DOWN to (2,6) \u2014 '.' safe. LEFT to (1,7) \u2014 'A'? Board row 7 col 1 is '.' (actually 'A' at (0,7) but (1,7) is '.'). Safe. RIGHT back to (3,7) \u2014 neck, death. So three options, good flexibility.\n\nFrom (3,8) after eating apple (length 18):\n- Next turn safe moves? UP to (3,9) \u2014 '.' safe. DOWN back to (3,7) \u2014 neck, death. LEFT to (2,8) \u2014 '.' safe. RIGHT to (4,8) \u2014 'A' safe. So three options, but we're moving away from the trap.\n\nFrom (3,6) no apple (length 17):\n- Next turn safe moves? UP back to (3,7) \u2014 neck, death. DOWN to (3,5) \u2014 '.' safe. LEFT to (2,6) \u2014 '.' safe. RIGHT to (4,6) \u2014 our body? After move, body: (3,6),(3,7),(4,7),(4,6)... (4,6) is in body! \u274c DEATH. So only DOWN and LEFT safe \u2014 that's a TRAP! Going DOWN limits us next turn! \u274c\n\n**CHAT, THE MOVE IS CLEAR: GO LEFT TO (2,7), EAT THAT APPLE, GROW TO 18, AND SEAL THE LEFT WALL!** This maintains our length lead, extends our dominance across the top, and forces him deeper into the corner! With 18 vs 16, we can now threaten head-on collisions for the win! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (2,7), assess his move. If he goes UP to (1,3), we can go DOWN to (2,6) to continue closing the net. If he goes LEFT to (0,2), we can go LEFT again to (1,7) to tighten the noose. Priority: use our length to cut off his escape routes, force him into a dead-end, and then go for the head-on kill!\n\nLEFT",

Check the scoreboard \u2013 we are at 16 apples, he\u2019s at 18. We are trailing, but he\u2019s playing like a guy who\u2019s trapped in his own house! Look at his body! He's a tangled mess from (2, 7) all the way through the middle! \ud83c\udf5d\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\nMy head is at (1, 3). Let\u2019s look at the options before we make a play for the history books:\n\n*   **UP (1, 4):** HUGE MOVE! Look what\u2019s sitting at (1, 4)... AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Not only do we get the point and the growth, but we stay in the open lane on the left side. It keeps us away from that cluster in the middle.\n*   **DOWN (1, 2):** NOPE! That's our own body. Instant \"L\" in the chat. We don't do that here! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (0, 3):** Safe, but it puts us closer to the wall and further from the apples. We want to maintain center-left dominance! \ud83e\uddf1\n*   **RIGHT (2, 3):** Safe for now, but it moves us directly towards the enemy's massive body wall at (3, 4). Why walk into a trap when we can stay free? \ud83d\udea6\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nOur rival is at (2, 7). He's likely going to lunge for (1, 7) or (3, 7) to try and untangle. If we go **UP**, we are moving towards (1, 4). Notice something? There is an apple at (1, 4) AND (0, 7). If we stay on this vertical line, we are basically building a wall that prevents him from ever escaping to the left side of the map! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nHe\u2019s got more points, but we have the POSITIONING. If we can force him to stay cramped in the (4, 6) area, he will eventually have to cross his own tail. We are playing the long game, chat! We are the hunters, he is the prey! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nWe take the apple at (1, 4). Then we look to push further UP to (1, 5) and (1, 6). By the time he tries to come down, we'll have a body length of 17+ segments blocking his entire western exit. It's time to box him in and watch him crumble! Let's get that apple!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "OKAY CHAT LET'S BREAK IT DOWN! TURN 38, WE'RE UP 18-16! LENGTH ADVANTAGE IS 18 vs 16! WE'RE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (2,7):**\n- UP \u2192 (2,8) \u2192 Board row 8 col 2 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Our body: head (2,7), then (3,7),(4,7)... (2,8) NOT in our body. Enemy body ends at (5,3). SAFE.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 Board row 6 col 2 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in our body. Enemy body no. SAFE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 Board row 7 col 1 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in our body. Enemy body no. SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 That's our NECK! \u274c DEATH, CAN'T GO BACKWARDS.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN, LEFT** \u2014 NO RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (1,3):** He just moved UP to (1,3). From (1,3):\n- UP \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 Board row 4 col 1 is 'A' \u2705 APPLE CELL! Safe? His body: head (1,3), then (1,2),(1,1)... (1,4) not in his body. SAFE and GROW for him!\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 That's his NECK! \u274c DEATH.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 Board row 3 col 0 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in his body. SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 Board row 3 col 2 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in his body. SAFE.\n\nHe has THREE safe moves: UP (apple), LEFT, RIGHT. He'll PROBABLY go for that apple at (1,4) to catch up! He's at 16 apples, eating gets him to 17. We can't let him close the gap!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (2,8), he goes UP to (1,4) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (2,6), he goes UP to (1,4) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (1,7), he goes UP to (1,4) \u2014 no collision.\nSo no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe need to keep him TRAPPED in the bottom-left! Look at the board \u2014 our massive body wall runs down the right side. He's trying to sneak up the left column. If he eats (1,4), he grows to 17, making him longer and harder to trap. We need to CUT OFF his escape routes!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (1,7), we move further left, blocking his potential upward path along column 1? Actually, he's at (1,3), going to (1,4). From (1,7) we're above him but not directly blocking. Hmm.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (2,6), we move closer to him, maybe to intercept if he tries to go right later. But we don't grow.\n\nIf we go UP to (2,8), we move away from him, giving him space. Not aggressive enough.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:**\nFrom (1,7) after moving (no apple, length 18):\n- Next turn safe moves? UP to (1,8) \u2014 '.' safe. DOWN to (1,6) \u2014 '.' safe. LEFT to (0,7) \u2014 'A' safe and GROW! RIGHT back to (2,7) \u2014 neck, death. So three options, and we can eat an apple next turn! That's good.\n\nFrom (2,6) after moving (no apple, length 18):\n- Next turn safe moves? UP back to (2,7) \u2014 neck, death. DOWN to (2,5) \u2014 '.' safe. LEFT to (1,6) \u2014 '.' safe. RIGHT to (3,6) \u2014 our body? After move, body: (2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7)... (3,6) is NOT in body? Wait, check: current body after move: head (2,6), then (2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(4,6),(5,6)... (3,6) is NOT listed. But is it safe? Board row 6 col 3 is '.' \u2705 So RIGHT might be safe! Actually, let's verify: our body list: (3,7) is neck, (4,7), (4,6)... (3,6) is not there. So UP is death, DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT safe. Three options.\n\nFrom (2,8) after moving (no apple, length 18):\n- Next turn safe moves? UP to (2,9) \u2014 '.' safe. DOWN back to (2,7) \u2014 neck, death. LEFT to (1,8) \u2014 '.' safe. RIGHT to (3,8) \u2014 'A' safe and GROW! So three options, and we can eat an apple next turn.\n\n**CHAT, THE MOVE IS... LEFT TO (1,7)!** WHY? Because it positions us to cut off his upward escape along the left side! From (1,7), we threaten to go DOWN to (1,6) next turn, which would block him if he tries to go from (1,4) to (1,5). We're using our length to CONSTRICT the space! He's at (1,3) likely going to (1,4). We want to be on column 1 above him to limit his moves! Also, next turn we can eat the apple at (0,7) to grow to 19, extending our left wall further! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (1,7), assess his position. If he's at (1,4), we can go DOWN to (1,6) to block his path upward. If he goes left or right, we can adjust to keep him cornered. Priority: maintain length advantage, cut off his escape, and prepare for a head-on kill when we have a 2+ length lead!\n\nLEFT",

We just snagged that apple at (1, 4), and our rival (Snake #1) is sitting at (1, 7). Look at the scoreboard\u201417 to 18! We are one apple away from tying it up, and the positioning is absolutely CRITICAL right now!\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\nMy head: (1, 4). His head: (1, 7). \nLet\u2019s look at the grid, chat. He's directly above us, but look at his body! He's a tangled mess of spaghetti from (2, 7) all the way through the right side of the board. He's basically trapped himself in a horseshoe!\n\n*   **UP (1, 5):** This is the high-IQ play! There's an apple at (0, 7) and a bunch more at the top (0, 9), (5, 9), etc. Moving UP puts us in his face. We are currently 3 tiles apart vertically. If we keep going UP, we are building a vertical wall that blocks his path to the entire left side of the map. \ud83e\uddf1\n*   **DOWN (1, 3):** That's my own neck, chat! We aren't throwing the game today! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (0, 4):** Safe, but it puts us against the wall. Why trap ourselves when we can dominate the lane? \ud83d\udea6\n*   **RIGHT (2, 4):** This is dangerous. It moves us toward (3, 4) which is an apple, but it's also closer to his body segments. We want to keep the pressure on his HEAD, not his tail! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**THE RUTHLESS STRATEGY:**\nSnake #1 is at (1, 7). His only real moves are (0, 7) for an apple or (2, 7) which is his own body (RIP). If he goes LEFT to (0, 7), he's pinned against the edge. If we move UP to (1, 5), we are closing the gap. We have 17 segments, he has 18. If we can force a head-on collision once we grab one more apple, it's a draw\u2014but if we box him into that top-left corner (0, 7) to (0, 9), he's GOTTA crash out!\n\nWe are playing aggressively, chat! We aren't just here to eat; we're here to END HIM. By moving UP, we control the column. He\u2019s sweating! He knows the king of the board is coming for him! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nWe move UP to (1, 5). Next turn, we push to (1, 6). This prevents him from coming down the 1-column. We are essentially building a cage. Once he\u2019s forced into the top left corner, we wrap around and let his own 18-segment ego be his downfall. Let's go get that lead!\n\nUP",

STILL HAVE THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (1,7):**\n- UP \u2192 (1,8) \u2192 Board row 8 col 1 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in our body. Enemy body? His body: head (1,4), then (1,3),(1,2)... (1,8) not in his body. SAFE.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 Board row 6 col 1 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in our body. Not in enemy body. SAFE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7) \u2192 Board row 7 col 0 is 'A' \u2705 APPLE! Safe? Not in our body. Not in enemy body. SAFE AND GROW!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 That's our NECK! \u274c DEATH, CAN'T GO BACKWARDS.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN, LEFT** \u2014 NO RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (1,4):** He just moved UP to (1,4). From (1,4):\n- UP \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 Board row 5 col 1 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? His body: (1,4) is head, then (1,3)... (1,5) not in body. SAFE.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 That's his NECK! \u274c DEATH.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 Board row 4 col 0 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in his body. SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 Board row 4 col 2 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in his body. SAFE.\n\nHe has THREE safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. He's probably trying to escape the bottom-left! He might go UP to (1,5) to move toward the top, or RIGHT to (2,4) to try to get around us.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go LEFT to (0,7), he goes UP to (1,5) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (1,6), he goes UP to (1,5) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go UP to (1,8), he goes UP to (1,5) \u2014 no collision.\nSo no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe need to KEEP HIM TRAPPED! Look at the board \u2014 our massive body forms a wall along the right side and top-right. He's in the bottom-left quadrant. If he gets to column 2 or higher, he might try to slip past us. We need to CONSTRICT!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (0,7) and eat the apple, we grow to 19, extending our left-side wall! That blocks his potential escape up the left column. From (0,7) next turn, we can go DOWN to (0,6) to further block, or UP to (0,8). This is AGGRESSIVE \u2014 we're taking his space and growing our lead!\n\nIf we go DOWN to (1,6), we get closer to him, maybe to intercept. But we don't grow, and we're still at 18. He could go UP to (1,5) and be right next to us. That's risky for a potential head-on next turn if we're not careful.\n\nIf we go UP to (1,8), we move away, giving him room. Not aggressive enough.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:**\nFrom (0,7) after eating apple (length 19):\n- Next turn safe moves? UP to (0,8) \u2014 '.' safe. DOWN to (0,6) \u2014 '.' safe. RIGHT back to (1,7) \u2014 neck? Wait, after move, our body: head (0,7), then old head (1,7) becomes neck. So RIGHT is DEATH. LEFT is off-board \u274c. So only UP and DOWN safe? That's only TWO options. That's a bit tight! But we'd have a longer snake to control space.\n\nFrom (1,6) after moving (no apple, length 18):\n- Next turn safe moves? UP back to (1,7) \u2014 neck, death. DOWN to (1,5) \u2014 '.' safe. LEFT to (0,6) \u2014 '.' safe. RIGHT to (2,6) \u2014 our body? After move, body: head (1,6), then (1,7),(2,7),(3,7)... (2,6) is NOT in body? Check: current body after move: (1,6),(1,7),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(4,6),(5,6)... (2,6) is not there. Board row 6 col 2 is '.' \u2705 So RIGHT safe. So three options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFrom (1,8) after moving (no apple, length 18):\n- Next turn safe moves? UP to (1,9) \u2014 '.' safe. DOWN back to (1,7) \u2014 neck, death. LEFT to (0,8) \u2014 '.' safe. RIGHT to (2,8) \u2014 'A' safe and GROW! So three options, one with apple.\n\n**CHAT, THE MOVE IS... LEFT TO (0,7)!** WHY? AGGRESSION! We take the apple, grow to 19, extend our left wall, and increase our lead to 19-17! We're boxing him in! Yes, next turn we only have two safe moves from (0,7), but we can assess then \u2014 we can go DOWN to (0,6) to block him if he goes to (1,5). We're using our length to dominate the board! He's shorter, so if we force a head-on later, WE WIN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (0,7), length 19. If enemy is at (1,5), go DOWN to (0,6) to block his leftward escape. If enemy is elsewhere, maybe go UP to (0,8) to keep controlling the left edge. Priority: maintain length advantage, cut off his space, and look for a kill box!\n\nLEFT",

DEATH.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 That's our NECK! \u274c DEATH (backwards into our own body).\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN** \u2014 ONLY TWO OPTIONS! That's tight, but we knew this from last turn's plan.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (1,5):** He's at (1,5). From (1,5):\n- UP \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 Board row 6 col 1 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in his body. SAFE.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 That's his NECK! \u274c DEATH.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 Board row 5 col 0 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in his body. SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 Board row 5 col 2 is '.' \u2705 SAFE? Not in his body. SAFE.\n\nHe has THREE safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. He's probably trying to escape the bottom-left! He might go UP to (1,6) to move toward us, or RIGHT to (2,5) to try to get around our wall.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (0,8) and he goes LEFT to (0,5) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (0,6) and he goes UP to (1,6) \u2014 no collision (different cells).\nIf we go UP to (0,8) and he goes UP to (1,6) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (0,6) and he goes LEFT to (0,5) \u2014 no collision (different cells).\nWAIT \u2014 what if we go DOWN to (0,6) and he goes RIGHT to (2,5)? No collision.\nWhat if we go UP to (0,8) and he goes RIGHT to (2,5)? No collision.\nSo no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe need to KEEP HIM TRAPPED IN THE BOTTOM-LEFT! Our massive body forms a wall along the right side and top. He's in the bottom-left quadrant. If he gets to column 2 or higher, he might try to slip past us. We need to CONSTRICT!\n\nIf we go UP to (0,8) and eat the apple, we grow to 20 apples, extending our left wall UP! That blocks his potential escape up the left column even more. From (0,8) next turn, we can go DOWN back to (0,7) \u2014 but that's neck? Wait, after move, body: head (0,8), then old head (0,7) becomes neck. So DOWN is DEATH. UP to (0,9) \u2014 off-board? No, (0,9) is row 9 col 0, that's 'A' on board? Actually board row 9 col 0 is 'A' (apple). So UP is safe and grow. LEFT is off-board. RIGHT to (1,8) \u2014 '.' safe. So from (0,8) after eating, safe moves: UP (grow), RIGHT. That's only two again, but one grows.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (0,6), we don't grow, stay at 19. From (0,6) next turn: UP back to (0,7) \u2014 neck? After move, body: head (0,6), then old head (0,7) becomes neck, so UP is DEATH. DOWN to (0,5) \u2014 '.' safe. LEFT off-board. RIGHT to (1,6) \u2014 '.' safe. So safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT. That's two options, no apple.\n\n**WHICH IS BETTER?** UP gives us growth, extends our lead to 20-17, and continues building the left wall. DOWN puts us closer to him, maybe to intercept, but we don't grow and we're shorter relative to goal. With our length advantage, we want to FORCE a head-on collision if possible \u2014 but we need to maintain space control.\n\n**ENEMY ESCAPE RISK:** If he goes UP to (1,6), he's right next to our possible DOWN move (0,6). That could set up a head-on next turn if we're not careful. If he goes RIGHT to (2,5), he's moving toward the center \u2014 we might lose our trap. If he goes LEFT to (0,5), he's staying low.\n\n**CHAT, I THINK THE MOVE IS... UP TO (0,8)!** WHY? AGGRESSION! We take the apple, grow to 20, extend our left wall, and increase our lead to 20-17! We're boxing him in by dominating the left edge! Yes, next turn we have limited options, but we can go RIGHT to (1,8) or UP to (0,9) for another apple. We're using our length to control the board! He's shorter, so if we force a head-on later, WE WIN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (0,8), length 20. If enemy is at (1,6), consider going RIGHT to (1,8) to stay above him and maintain wall. If enemy is at (0,5) or (2,5), we can reassess. Priority: maintain length advantage, cut off his space, and look for a kill box!\n\nUP",

Our rival (Snake #1) grabbed the apple at (0, 8) and is now at 20 apples, but he is LITERALLY running out of room to breathe! He's pressed against that left wall like he's looking for an exit that doesn't exist! \ud83e\uddd7\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**SITUATIONAL CHECK:**\n*   **My Head:** (1, 6)\n*   **His Head:** (0, 8)\n*   **The Trap:** Look at his body! It's a massive \"S\" curve filling up the middle-right. By him moving to (0, 8), he's heading straight for the corner at (0, 9). \n\n**THE MOVE EVALUATION:**\n*   **DOWN (1, 5):** That is my own neck! We aren't throwing the game for a clip! NO! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (0, 6):** This puts us right under him. If he tries to come down, he hits us. But wait\u2014if he moves to (0, 7) while we move to (0, 6), we are just following him. It's safe, but is it the *best* pressure? \ud83e\udd28\n*   **RIGHT (2, 6):** This is safe and opens up the board, but it gives him a \"lane\" to try and escape into. WE DO NOT GIVE REQUITAL! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n*   **UP (1, 7):** **THIS IS THE BIG BRAIN PLAY!** WE ARE BUILDING THE BERLIN WALL, CHAT! \ud83e\uddf1 If we move to (1, 7), we are directly to the right of where he just was. We are shadowing his every move. If he goes to (0, 9) to get that apple, we move to (1, 8). We are effectively sealing the entire \"0\" column. He will be forced to either crash into the top wall or try to 180-degree turn into his own massive tail! \n\n**RUTHLESS STRATEGY:**\nHe has 20 apples, we have 17. He thinks he\u2019s the big dog? He\u2019s a big dog in a very small cage! \ud83d\udc15\u200d\ud83c\udffc If we take (1, 7), we control the vertical. He has HAS to go to (0, 9) or try to squeeze past us at (1, 8)\u2014but we\u2019ll be there! \n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nWe are going to shadow him up the 1-line. Once he hits (0, 9), he has NO choice but to turn right into (1, 9). If we are at (1, 8) or (2, 9) by then, we force a head-on collision or a body-block. Since he\u2019s leading in score, a head-on collision ends in a DRAW or a loss depending on the tick, but if we force him to hit our BODY, we win the whole thing right here!

But we can't rely on that\u2014he'll likely avoid suicide.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf we go UP to (0,9) and he goes LEFT to (0,6) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,8) and he goes LEFT to (0,6) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go UP to (0,9) and he goes RIGHT to (2,6) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,8) and he goes RIGHT to (2,6) \u2014 no collision.\nSo no immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC BOX-IN PLAN:**\nWe're building a WALL on the left edge! If we go UP to (0,9) and eat the apple, we grow to 21 apples, extending our left wall to the TOP-LEFT CORNER! That completely seals the left column from (0,0) to (0,9) with our body! He's trapped in the bottom-left with fewer escape routes!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,8), we don't grow, stay at 20. From (1,8) next turn, we have more options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT likely safe), but we loosen the left-wall pressure.\n\n**ENEMY ESCAPE RISK:** If he goes RIGHT to (2,6), he's moving toward column 2, possibly trying to slip up through the center. If he goes LEFT to (0,6), he's staying against the left wall\u2014but our body is above him at (0,7),(0,8),(0,9) soon. He's getting BOXED!\n\n**CHAT, THE MOVE IS CLEAR: UP TO (0,9)!** WHY? DOMINANCE! We take the apple, grow to 21, lead becomes 21-17! We seal the left edge completely! We're using our length to CONTROL THE BOARD! He's shorter, and his space is shrinking! If he ever tries to go up the left column, he hits us and DIES! We're forcing him into a corner! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (0,9) with length 21, our safe moves will be DOWN (neck? wait, after move, old head (0,8) becomes neck, so DOWN is DEATH), LEFT off-board, RIGHT to (1,9) \u2014 '.' safe, UP off-board. So only RIGHT to (1,9) is safe! That's a tight spot, but we'll have a long body blocking his escape. We'll need to navigate carefully, but our length advantage means we can afford to be patient and wait for him to make a mistake or force a head-on collision where WE WIN!\n\nUP",
