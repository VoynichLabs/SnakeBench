The enemy snake (ID: 2) is currently at (9, 0) and is moving up, so it poses no immediate threat to my current position.\n\nThe strategy will be to collect the nearest apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements. After collecting the apple at (3, 8), I should reassess the situation to decide the next move. It would be wise to avoid moving into the path of the enemy snake and to collect apples in a way that does not corner myself or leave me with fewer escape routes.\n\nGiven this, the next move should be: UP.\n\nAfter moving up, I will need to consider the next apple to collect. The apple at (2, 2) is in a corner and might be a good target after collecting the one above me, as it's isolated and won't put me in immediate danger from the enemy snake. However, I should remain flexible and ready to adapt to the changing positions on the board."

Since I'm currently at (9, 0), I can move up (direction: UP), down (direction: DOWN), or left (direction: LEFT).\n\nNow, let's consider the strategy:\n1. Collect as many apples as possible to gain points.\n2. Avoid collisions with walls, other snakes, and myself.\n3. Try to position myself in a way that allows me to block enemy snakes or cut them off from apples.\n\nGiven the current board state, I can see 3 apples that I can reach without colliding with walls or other snakes: (8, 4), (3, 8), and (2, 2).\n\nTo collect the most apples, I should move towards the apple at (8, 4) since it's the closest one. However, moving left (direction: LEFT) would allow me to potentially block Snake #1 from reaching the apple at (9, 8) in the future.\n\nSo, my strategy for this turn is to collect the apple at (8, 4) and potentially block Snake #1.\n\nMy next move: LEFT."
