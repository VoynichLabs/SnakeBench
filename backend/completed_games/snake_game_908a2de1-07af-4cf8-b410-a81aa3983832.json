It's also not clear if there are any other obstacles or dangers nearby.\n\nOne strategy I want to tell myself for this turn is to move towards the nearest apple, try to position myself to be able to reach the apple in subsequent turns, and maintain awareness of the enemy snake's location.\n\nLooking at the board, it seems that I have a narrow window of opportunity to move towards the nearest apple without running into the enemy snake or the walls. I can move down to (2, 1), which would still be a safe move, but it would also put me directly below the enemy snake's potential path. However, moving down also reduces my visibility and puts me in a vulnerable position.\n\nConsidering the safety of the movement, I should probably err on the side of caution and explore other options.\n\nAnother apple is at (4, 7), but reaching it would require more significant navigation efforts and might put me in a dead-end position.\n\nFor now, I'm going to choose a relatively conservative approach, considering the enemy snake's location and potential movements.\n\nSince there's no clear vision or advantage in moving right or up, I will decide on moving down to get a better understanding of the snakes' positions in relation to the board layout.\n\nNext move: DOWN.",

My biggest worry is running into the wall on the right of the board, and also the enemy snake. The enemy snake is a lot closer than I thought, so I may want to prioritize avoiding it next turn.\n\nHowever, again, my main priority needs to be getting closer to one of the remaining apples. Let's think: Right now I am relatively central on the board vertically, which is helpful for accessing the top fruit or the bottom fruit. But horizontally, I am positioned to perhaps be more worried about avoiding the enemy whim.\n\nIt might look like the enemy snake might move towards me. So, I might rethink trying to move to the right to get closer to that top right corner fruit. Waiting to see the enemy snake move will let me avoid staying too centered on the board.\n\nI need to move my strategy on securing one of the remaining fruits: given the scores, it seems like the fruit at (8,3) is more available to me, so I want to think about getting to it. To get a good angle for my position, to where I am close enough to the fruit at (8,3) I am in trouble if the enemy snake moves at all, since we are both currently on the rightside of the board.\n\nIf I look at what would happen if our positions collided, it is essential that I can satisfy myself with the presence of the fruit at (8,3), such that the opponent can not move to it, thereby removing me from my first priority, as battle may take-first, securing the next best path, basically more considerations with more players involved.\n\nNow, thinking about it some more: If I take the risk of moving right now, I do slightly decrease my size to avoid my title when I open it up to myself... After my head moved to the right, my body should not move to the new x-coordinate at any given time because I only updated the possible positions in a node, but basically, overall, it's understandable if you'll put yourself on track to being the only route that followed throughout 1.\n\nLet's trust the board state doesn't change at this time, and add up an additional step that could happen with my presence there on the board.\n\nAgain given more, my next move based on where I am located on the fields is presumably a strategy to also prioritize to approach  (8, 3).\n\nTo finish up: this means there's as simple a plan as DOWN and add up next turns as RIGHT.
