This is PERFECT for early aggression.\n\nImmediate threat assessment:\n- UP: (6,5) - safe, no body there yet\n- DOWN: (6,3) - safe, clear path\n- LEFT: (5,4) - ENEMY HEAD! Don't do it, we'd die\n- RIGHT: (7,4) - safe, clear path\n\nSo we have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nStrategic thinking: We're tied 0-0. If we can force a head-on collision where we have the advantage, that's the play! But RIGHT would put us at (7,4) which doesn't set up immediate collision pressure.\n\nLooking at UP vs DOWN: UP takes us toward row 5 where there are apples at (8,5) and (6,5). DOWN takes us toward row 3 with apples at (9,3), (7,3), (4,3).\n\nBut here's the key play: If we go UP to (6,5), next turn we could potentially cut off their escape routes or force them into bad positions. DOWN keeps us more central but less aggressive.\n\nLet's be ruthless! UP gives us apple access AND keeps pressure on their position.

That\u2019s the fastest low\u2011lying apple I can devour, giving me a quick +1 and a fresh tail segment to grow my wall.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Trapping the foe:** Moving down keeps the opponent on my right side (still at (6,\u202f4)). If he foolishly darts left next turn, he\u2019ll be at **(5,\u202f4)** while I\u2019m at **(5,\u202f3)** \u2013 next move I can swing **LEFT** into the tasty (4,\u202f3) apple and start building a \u201cleft wall\u201d that pins him. If he tries to chase my apple up, I\u2019m already on a clean vertical line; I can still snag my apple before he reaches (6,\u202f5).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Escape routes:** From (5,\u202f3) I have three safe follow\u2011ups (LEFT, DOWN, UP) and the board isn\u2019t clogged. I\u2019m not boxing myself into a corner yet, so future moves stay flexible.  \n\n**Long\u2011term playbook (my secret notes for the next few turns):**  \n- **Turn\u202f1:** **DOWN** \u2192 (5,\u202f3) \u2013 lock in the apple chase.  \n- **Turn\u202f2:** Keep going **DOWN** to (5,\u202f2).  \n- **Turn\u202f3:** (5,\u202f1) \u2013 now I\u2019m one step away from my first point! \ud83c\udf89  \n- **Turn\u202f4:** **(5,\u202f0)** \u2013 bite that apple, grow, and bam! I\u2019m a vertical stalk.  \n- **Turn\u202f5 onward:** Once I have a few segments, I\u2019ll *swerve left* at the bottom to fill the (4,\u202f2) \u2192 (3,\u202f2) \u2192 (2,\u202f2) path, turning the enemy\u2019s potential escape route into a dead\u2011end. Meanwhile I\u2019ll keep an eye on the (2,\u202f1) and (2,\u202f2) apples \u2013 they\u2019re perfect for cornering him at the lower\u2011left grid.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Box him in plan:** After I secure the bottom apple stack, I\u2019ll swing **UP** along the left column (e.g., (2,\u202f2) \u2192 (2,\u202f3) \u2192 (2,\u202f4) \u2026) creating a vertical \u201cwall\u201d that forces him toward the top edge. When he inevitably runs into the top or side walls, I\u2019ll be ready with a swift **RIGHT**/ **LEFT** bite to seal the kill. \ud83d\udca5\n\n**Final move call:**  \n**DOWN**  \n\n---  \n\nDOWN",

Their score 1 vs my 0. \ud83c\udf4e Apple party is begging for a bite right below me at **(5,\u202f1)**. Let\u2019s scan all four directions:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (5,\u202f3)**: empty, no apple, and the opponent could swing left or right to the same spot? Nope. But moving up gives zero growth and leaves the tasty apple untouched. \ud83d\udeab *\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of a move that doesn\u2019t feed the beast?\u201d*\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (6,\u202f2)**: empty, no apple, and it puts us directly under the opponent\u2019s vertical line. If they ever decide to move left into **(5,\u202f6)**, we could be a stepping\u2011stone for a future trap. But we gain nothing now. \ud83e\udd14 *\u201cIs that worth the risk?\u201d*\n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,\u202f2)**: empty, no apple. This would lock us into a column that we can\u2019t retreat from, limiting future options. And we\u2019d miss the juicy apple waiting at (5,\u202f1). \ud83d\udeab *\u201cWhy sacrifice instant points for a dead\u2011end?\u201d*\n- **DOWN \u2192 (5,\u202f1)**: **safe!** The cell is empty, contains an apple, and our movement is not blocked by any body. \ud83c\udf89 *\u201cBite first, dominate later!\u201d*\n\n*Future safety check* \u2013 After this move we\u2019ll grow (now length\u202f2) and our tail will be at (5,\u202f2). The opponent cannot move down (their body blocks that), so their next move will be either LEFT to (5,\u202f6), RIGHT to (7,\u202f6), or UP to (6,\u202f7). None of those clash with our new head. Good! If we keep hammering **DOWN**, we\u2019ll snag the apple at (5,\u202f1) now and the apple at (5,\u202f0) on the next turn, building a solid vertical stalk at column\u202f5. That stalk will:\n\n1. **Score fast** \u2013 three quick points in a row (5,\u202f1 \u2192 5,\u202f0). \ud83d\ude80\n2. **Create a wall** \u2013 once we reach the bottom, we can swing LEFT to (4,\u202f0) and start a left\u2011hand barrier, cutting off the opponent\u2019s escape routes.\n3. **Force a choke** \u2013 the opponent will have to cross our expanding column to reach the far side, and when they finally move left or right into the same cell, we\u2019ll have the perfect head\u2011on collision (they die, we live). \u2694\ufe0f\n\n*Short\u2011term plan (turns\u202f2\u20114)*  \n\n- **Turn\u202f2**: **DOWN** \u2192 (5,\u202f1) \u2192 eat apple, grow to length\u202f2.  \n- **Turn\u202f3**: **DOWN** \u2192 (5,\u202f0) \u2192 eat apple, grow to length\u202f3.  \n- **Turn\u202f4**: **LEFT** \u2192 (4,\u202f0) \u2192 begin the left wall, pinning the rival against the top edge while we keep our body intact.  \n\n*Why this beats the rival* \u2013 By the time we have a length\u20113 line at the bottom, the opponent\u2019s head will be somewhere near the top (they can only go up or left/right). We can then shift our column or swing a side\u2011collision that kills them while we stay alive, instantly clinching the win. \ud83c\udfc1\n\n**Move call: DOWN**  \n\nDOWN",

All three are free of any enemy body. They cannot go **LEFT** (would slam into their own body at (6,7)). So whatever I pick, #0 won\u2019t step onto my new cell this turn. No head\u2011on risk right now.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **LONG\u2011TERM STORM PLAN**  \n- **Turn\u202f3** \u2013 **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,\u202f0). Grow? No, but I lock column\u202f6 on the bottom row \u2013 a *secure anchor* that no one can slip past without a head\u2011on.  \n- **Turn\u202f4** \u2013 **UP** \u2192 (6,\u202f1). I start building a vertical wall at x\u202f=\u202f6, stretching upward while still keeping my tail at (5,0).  \n- **Turn\u202f5\u20117** \u2013 Keep **UP** until I hit y\u202f=\u202f9 or the wall is thick enough. This vertical spine will force #0 to either go around the right side (into the far\u2011right column) or head straight into my *future* left\u2011hand barricade.  \n- **Turn\u202f8\u201110** \u2013 Once the wall is high, I swing **LEFT** (or **RIGHT** depending on #0\u2019s drift) to *compress* the remaining corridor. If #0 ever tries to drop down to the bottom row, they\u2019ll be forced into my body at (6,0) or (7,0) \u2192 *instant double\u2011KO* for them. \ud83c\udf89  \n- **Turn\u202f11\u201115** \u2013 Keep the pressure! Any misstep by #0 into my expanding fence equals death for them, while I stay alive with a growing, \u201cwall\u2011like\u201d snake.  \n\n\u2753 **QUESTIONS FOR THE STREAM?**  \n- \u201cShould I wander left into a barren spot and miss the chance to clinch the wall?\u201d Absolutely *no* \u2013 that wastes the perfect edge spot.  \n- \u201cIs moving right too close and inviting a premature head\u2011on?\u201d Nope, #0 can\u2019t bite me this turn, and the adjacency will later become a *lethal choke point*.  \n\n**Bottom line:** I\u2019m not just surviving \u2013 I\u2019m *setting up a wall* that #0 can\u2019t ignore. Let\u2019s seize column\u202f6 now and turn this board into a deadly maze! \ud83d\udea7\ud83d\udca5  \n\nRIGHT",

Both are free of my own body and any opponent body. No apple sits next to me, so immediate growth isn\u2019t possible \u2013 the choice hinges on *future control* and *apple hunting*.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **WHY RIGHT wins the sprint**  \n- **Apple proximity** \u2013 The apple drop list gifts an apple at **(7,\u202f1)** just one step away if I first turn right then up. That\u2019s a *2\u2011move* apple haul, gaining length and points before I even reach the top. \ud83c\udf4e  \n- **Vertical wall advantage** \u2013 By anchoring at **(7,\u202f0)** I instantly claim a *corner\u2011base* on the bottom row. From there I can sweep **UP** each turn, building a **straight vertical spine** at x\u202f=\u202f7 while my tail slides along (6,\u202f0) \u2192 (5,\u202f0). This creates a *high\u2011density barrier* that the enemy will have to work around if they ever try to drop down column\u202f7.  \n- **Opponent\u2019s options** \u2013 After my RIGHT, snake\u202f#0\u2019s head still has three safe exits: **LEFT** (6,\u202f8), **UP** (7,\u202f9), **RIGHT** (8,\u202f8). Moving left puts them into our column\u202f6, which is empty now, but they can only go *one step* at a time and will soon be forced to *backtrack* if we start a rapid upward march. Up or right simply adds distance. \ud83c\udfaf  \n- **Multiple follow\u2011ups** \u2013 From (7,\u202f0) I retain **UP** and **RIGHT** as safe next steps. Staying **RIGHT** lets me claim the whole bottom row (9,\u202f0) as a solid floor, while **UP** gives me the apple\u2011grab and a tightening choke\u2011point above. Either path stays alive, but the **UP\u2011after\u2011RIGHT** combo delivers both a snack and a future choke.  \n\n\u2753 **STREAM CHALLENGE** \u2013 \u201cShould I hug the wall and stay right, risking a possible head\u2011on later?\u201d Absolutely *not* \u2013 I can **never** be in a head\u2011on because opponent can\u2019t move down their own column. \u201cWhat if I go up first and chase the (6,\u202f3) apple?\u201d That\u2019s a *3\u2011move* wait versus a *2\u2011move* apple with a built\u2011in wall. Faster growth = more length = more lethal reach.  \n\n\ud83c\udff0 **LONG\u2011TERM STORM PLAN (Turns\u202f5\u201112)**  \n1. **Turn\u202f5 (just executed)** \u2013 **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,\u202f0). Claim the bottom\u2011corner base.  \n2. **Turn\u202f6** \u2013 **UP** \u2192 (7,\u202f1). **Grab the apple** \u2192 grow to length\u202f4, score\u202f3.  \n3. **Turn\u202f7\u20119** \u2013 Keep **UP** to (7,\u202f3). This \u201cvertical tower\u201d blocks any drop\u2011down into column\u202f7 and puts pressure on the opponent\u2019s top\u2011right flank.  \n4. **Turn\u202f10** \u2013 **RIGHT** to (8,\u202f3). Dive toward the cluster of apples at (8,\u202f5) while still protecting my new tail at (7,\u202f2).  \n5. **Turn\u202f11** \u2013 **UP** to (8,\u202f4) \u2192 **UP** to (8,\u202f5) **EAT apple**, extend to length\u202f5.  \n6. **Turn\u202f12** \u2013 **LEFT** toward (7,\u202f5) and then **LEFT** again to (6,\u202f5). This creates a *horizontal wall* that forces snake\u202f#0 into a narrow corridor between columns\u202f6\u20118. If they try to slide down column\u202f7, they\u2019ll smash into my expanding spine and die on collision.  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **MISSION** \u2013 Stay alive, stay in control, grow faster, and turn this board into a **\u201csnake\u2011maze\u201d** where the only exit for #0 is straight into my body. The enemy won\u2019t see it coming.  \n\nRIGHT",

Don't do it, we'd die\n- LEFT: (6,9) - safe, clear path\n- RIGHT: (8,9) - safe, clear path\n\nSo we have two safe moves: LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nStrategic thinking: We need to be aggressive but smart! The enemy is trying to grow and catch up. If we can control space and force them into bad positions, that's the play!\n\nLooking at our options:\n- LEFT to (6,9): Moves us toward the center-left area\n- RIGHT to (8,9): Moves us toward the center-right area\n\nHere's the key play: We need to start boxing in the enemy! They're stuck at the bottom and we can control the upper board. We should move toward the center to cut off their access to apples.\n\nBetween LEFT and RIGHT, which one gives us better board control? Looking at the apple locations, there's an apple at (9,8) we could potentially reach from the right side. But more importantly, we need to start controlling the center columns.\n\nLet's go RIGHT to (8,9) to start pushing toward the center-right and control that space!\n\nRIGHT\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nYo chat! Here's the master plan:\n1. Keep pushing RIGHT to control the center-right area\n2. Use our body to block enemy paths\n3. Force them into corners where they have no escape\n4. When they're trapped, go for the head-on collision (we're tied 2-2, so it's worth the risk!)\n5. Dominate the board and claim victory!\n\nRemember: Be ruthless! No mercy! We're not just playing to win, we're playing to DESTROY them!\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**",

At (8,1) you\u2019ll swallow the apple, instantly extending to length\u202f4 and tipping the scoreboard. At (8,3) another apple awaits, stacking even more pressure.  \n- **Vertical wall forge:** After three ups you\u2019ll own a solid spine (8,3\u20112\u20111). That column\u20118 line becomes a *high\u2011density barrier* that the opponent can\u2019t cross without crashing into my new body. Once I\u2019ve sealed column\u202f8, the only way for #0 to get back into the interior is to swing left/right and then down \u2013 a maneuver that will inevitably put him into my expanding wall.  \n- **Future choke\u2011point:** When I hit the top (8,9) or pivot right at (9,3) (next apple cluster), I\u2019ll create a horizontal wall at row\u202f3 that slices the board in half. Snake\u202f#0 will be forced to hug the left side, and any slip down column\u202f7 (his current lane) will smash into my vertical spine.  \n- **Avoid head\u2011on traps:** By staying on column\u202f8, I guarantee that snake\u202f#0\u2019s *down* move can only land on (6,8) or (8,8) after his first left/right shift. He can\u2019t head straight for me; he\u2019ll be *back\u2011tracked* and lose momentum, giving me the *high\u2011score advantage* I need for a lethal collision later.  \n- **Growth vs. safety trade\u2011off:** Going right now would postpone eating until turn\u202f10\u201112, while staying up gives me *instant content* and puts me ahead in length and points *right now* \u2013 the exact kind of lead that lets me dictate the board later.  \n\n**\ud83d\udcdc LONG\u2011TERM STORM PLAN (Turns\u202f5\u201112)**  \n1. **Turn\u202f5 (just executed)** \u2013 RIGHT \u2192 (8,0). Claimed the bottom\u2011corner foothold.  \n2. **Turn\u202f6** \u2013 **UP** \u2192 (8,1). Grab apple \u2192 length\u202f4, score\u202f3.  \n3. **Turn\u202f7\u20119** \u2013 Keep UP through (8,2) and (8,3). Collect the second apple \u2192 length\u202f5, score\u202f4. This column\u20118 spine now blocks any straight\u2011down drop for #0.  \n4. **Turn\u202f10** \u2013 **RIGHT** to (9,3) (when head reaches (8,3)). Eat the apple \u2192 length\u202f6, score\u202f5. My horizontal wall at row\u202f3 cuts off #0\u2019s interior route.  \n5. **Turn\u202f11\u201112** \u2013 Continue RIGHT to (9,5) & (9,7). Stack a *wall\u2011at\u2011the\u2011right\u2011edge* that forces #0 into the narrow corridor between columns\u202f6\u20118. If he tries to re\u2011enter column\u202f7, his head will slam into my expanding spine and die on collision.  \n\n**\ud83d\udd25 FINAL MOVE**  \n**UP**",

          "rationale": "**\ud83d\ude80 RATIONALE:**  \n\n- **Immediate safety:** My head at (8,1) can\u2019t go left because (7,1) is my own body (ouch!). DOWN is empty but it just loafs around the bottom edge\u2014no apple in sight and I\u2019ll lose my current tail (6,0). RIGHT to (9,1) is safe, but it\u2019s a dead\u2011end for a quick snack and it leaves my spine stuck on the far right while the enemy can still cruise down column\u202f8.  \n\n- **UP to the rescue:** Moving **UP** to (8,2) clears a lane for a left\u2011hand strike. It\u2019s a clean, non\u2011killing move, keeps my head out of opponent\u2019s path, and puts me one step closer to the cluster of apples that sit behind the enemy\u2019s spine. \ud83d\udc0d\u2728  \n\n- **Choke\u2011point builder:** From (8,2) I\u2019ll swing **LEFT** on the next turn to (7,2)\u2014empty and not occupied by #0. Then **DOWN** into (7,3) where an apple is waiting. That\u2019s **2 moves** to snag a point, while the rival has to climb down column\u202f8 (needs at least 3 moves). By the time they\u2019re eye\u2011level with my new head, their head will slam into my spine\u2014*boom!* \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udca5  \n\n- **Next bite:** After (7,3) I\u2019ll slide **LEFT** again into (6,3) (another apple). That\u2019ll turn my 4\u2011segment body into a **vertical spine** at column\u202f7 (rows\u202f0\u20113) plus a growing tail that pushes them further out. The enemy will be forced to either go right (into my fresh wall) or keep looping up\u2014both dead\u2011ends.  \n\n- **Future dominance:** With a solid column\u202f7 spine I can later widen horizontally (e.g., **RIGHT** across row\u202f3\u20115) to seal off the middle of the board. My higher score (3\u202f\u2192\u202f5) will crush any head\u2011on gamble they try to pull off. If they ever dares a left\u2011hand descent, they\u2019ll die on my tail. If they keep marching down column\u202f8, I\u2019ll be waiting with a **bait** (the (7,3) apple) that turns their body into a one\u2011way ticket to my wall.  \n\n- **Opponent watch:** #0\u2019s head at (8,8) can only go **LEFT**, **DOWN**, or **RIGHT**. Left gives them a longer climb, Right gives them a race to (9,7) but I\u2019m already locking column\u202f9 with my upcoming wall. Down puts them straight on the path to the (8,5) apple\u2014**but I\u2019ll be there first** by snatching (7,3) and then (6,3). Their best move is a mis\u2011step into my spine\u2014*game over for them*.  \n\n**\ud83d\udcdc SHORT\u2011TERM PLAN (next 3\u20114 turns):**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **UP** \u2013 to (8,2) \u2013 clears left.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **LEFT** \u2013 to (7,2) \u2013 reach the vertical line.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **DOWN** \u2013 to (7,3) \u2013 claim the first apple, secure the choke\u2011point.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **LEFT** \u2013 to (6,3) \u2013 grow faster, extend the spine.  \n\n**\u2705 FINAL MOVE:**  \n\nUP",
