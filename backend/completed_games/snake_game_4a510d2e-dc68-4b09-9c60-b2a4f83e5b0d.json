          "rationale": "Moving left to (4,8) keeps me on the board, avoids my own neck, and brings me closer to the accessible apple at (4,7) while keeping the northern passage open for escape. The enemy snake is far away, and no bodies block that space, so LEFT is safe and keeps future options open.\n\nPlan: Head down to (4,7) on the next move to grab that apple, then reassess to see if I can pivot toward another near apple while keeping clear of potentially closing areas from the northern edge.\n\nLEFT",
