The (4,5) apple is gone, so I need to find a new target\n2. Moving UP to (5,6) would take me toward (8,9) but also closer to enemy head\n3. Moving DOWN to (5,4) would take me toward (6,0)\n4. Moving LEFT to (4,5) would position me near where the apple was, but no immediate benefit\n5. I need to be cautious about the enemy potentially moving toward me\n6. My snake has good maneuverability with current body shape\n\nLong-term plan:\n1. Move UP this turn to (5,6) to position myself for the (8,9) apple\n2. Next turns, continue moving toward (8,9) while maintaining safe distance from enemy\n3. Keep an eye on enemy movements - if they move toward me, consider alternative paths\n4.
