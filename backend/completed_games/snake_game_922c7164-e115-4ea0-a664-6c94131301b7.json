(3, 4) - Distance 1 (Right)\n2. (2, 6) - Distance 2 (Up, Up)\n3. (1, 5) - Distance 2 (Left, Up or Up, Left)\n\nThe enemy head (5, 7) is far away. Any move I make is unlikely to immediately cause a collision if the enemy plays somewhat rationally, especially since they are also very short.\n\nLet's evaluate my possible moves:\n\n**Target: (3, 4) [Apple A2]**\nMoving RIGHT from (2, 4) leads to (3, 4).\n1. **Safety Check (New Head Position: (3, 4))**:\n    * Off board? No (0-9 range).\n    * Into own body? No body yet.\n    * Into enemy body? No enemy body.\n    * Head-on collision? Enemy (5, 7) moves somewhere. Unless they move to (3, 4), I am safe from head-on collision. Since the enemy's potential moves are (4, 7), (6, 7), (5, 6), or (5, 8), collision is impossible this turn unless the enemy makes a very strange choice (which they cannot, as they also have 4 options).\n\n**Target: (2, 6) [Apple A4]**\nMoving UP from (2, 4) leads to (2, 5). This is not the apple, but one step closer to it.\n1. **Safety Check (New Head Position: (2, 5))**: Safe (similar reasons as above). I would then target (2, 6) next turn.\n\n**Target: (1, 5) [Apple A5]**\nMoving LEFT from (2, 4) leads to (1, 4).\n1. **Safety Check (New Head Position: (1, 4))**: Safe. I would then target (1, 5) next turn.\n\n**Priority:** Eating the closest apple seems optimal for immediate score gain and growth, as my snake is very short and has no immediate danger from self-collision.\n\nThe closest apple reachable in one move is (3, 4). Moving RIGHT places me directly on this apple.\n\n**Move RIGHT to (3, 4):**\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 4), I eat the apple.\nNew Head: (3, 4)\nNew Body: (2, 4) (The old head position becomes part of the tail)\nApples: 1\nLength: 2\n\nThis is the most direct path to satisfying the primary objective: safely eating an apple.\n\nLet's confirm the enemy move possibilities just in case they somehow block me or create future danger. Enemy (5, 7). Potential moves: (4, 7), (6, 7), (5, 6), (5, 8). None of these interfere with my target (3, 4).\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to eat the apple at (3, 4) is the best choice.\n\nLong-term plan: Focus on eating the closest available apples sequentially, prioritizing immediate growth while maintaining an open board position. Since I am short, direct targeting is safe.\n\nRIGHT is the choice.\nRIGHT",

My previous head was (2,4), the apple was at (3,4).\n\nCurrent State (Beginning of Turn 2):\nMy snake (ID 1): Head: (3, 4), Body: [(2, 4)], Length: 2, Apples: 1. (The apple at (3,4) is gone, the board reflects it as '1' where the head is, or 'T' if it was the tail, which it is not. In the board: T=(2,4) body, 1=(3,4) head).\nEnemy snake #0: Head: (4, 7), Body: [], Length: 1, Apples: 0.\n\nApples available: (9, 3), (7, 0), (2, 6), (1, 5), (7, 4).\n\nTargeting Strategy:\nThe closest remaining apple is (2, 6) [Distance 2 via (3, 5) or (2, 5) -> (2, 6)] or (1, 5) [Distance 2 via (2, 5) or (2, 4) -> (1, 5) if I could go back, but I can't].\nFrom (3, 4):\n1. Target (2, 6): Needs 2 moves (e.g., UP to (3, 5), then UP to (3, 6) or LEFT to (2, 4) which is occupied, or UP to (3, 5), then UP to (3, 6)). Let's re-evaluate distances.\n   (3, 4) -> (2, 6) is 1 Left, 2 Up. Total 3 steps minimum.\n2. Target (1, 5): Needs 2 moves (e.g., LEFT to (2, 4) - WAIT, (2, 4) is my body, so I cannot move there!).\n   (3, 4) -> UP to (3, 5) -> LEFT to (2, 5) -> LEFT to (1, 5). 3 steps minimum. Or LEFT to (2, 4) - BLOCKED. Or LEFT to (2, 4) is the previous head position occupied by my body. Wait, my body is just (2, 4).\n\nLet's list safe next steps from (3, 4):\n1. UP to (3, 5). Safe. Body remains [(2, 4)].\n2. DOWN to (3, 3). Safe. Body remains [(2, 4)].\n3. LEFT to (2, 4). **Collision!** (2, 4) is my body segment. DEAD. Move LEFT is impossible.\n4. RIGHT to (4, 4). Safe. Body remains [(2, 4)].\n\nEliminated Moves: LEFT.\n\nEvaluating Safe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nEnemy Movement Prediction (Head at (4, 7)):\nPossible Enemy Heads (E'): (3, 7), (5, 7), (4, 6), (4, 8). (Assuming they prioritize safe non-self-colliding moves, as they are length 1).\n\n1. **Move UP to (3, 5)**.\n   New Head position (3, 5). Body [(2, 4)].\n   Is (3, 5) hit by any E'? No, E' is between y=6 and y=8. Safe from head-on collision.\n   Next target: (2, 6) or (1, 5). (3, 5) is 1 step away from (2, 5) or (3, 6). Close to (2, 6).\n\n2. **Move DOWN to (3, 3)**.\n   New Head position (3, 3). Body [(2, 4)].\n   Is (3, 3) hit by any E'? No. Safe from head-on collision.\n   This seems like a diversion unless it puts me closer to apple (9, 3). (3, 3) is 6 steps from (9, 3). (3, 4) was 6 steps away. Not much benefit.\n\n3. **Move RIGHT to (4, 4)**.\n   New Head position (4, 4). Body [(2, 4)].\n   Is (4, 4) hit by any E'? No. Safe from head-on collision.\n   This puts me closer to apple (7, 4). Distance reduced from 3 to 2 in x, same y. Attractive if (7, 4) is the priority.\n\nComparing UP vs RIGHT:\nUP ((3, 5)) points towards the cluster of apples NW ((2, 6), (1, 5)).\nRIGHT ((4, 4)) points towards the cluster of apples E ((7, 4), (9, 3)).\n\nThe closest apple is (2, 6) at Manhattan distance 2 from (3, 4) *if* (2, 5) was open.\n(3, 4) to (2, 6): requires Left, Up, Up (3 steps total Manhattan distance if the path was clear), or 1 Left, 1 Up, 1 Up, 1 Left (if path blocked).\nIf UP -> (3, 5). Distance to (2, 6) is now 1 Left, 1 Up (2 steps).\nIf RIGHT -> (4, 4). Distance to (7, 4) is 3 steps. (4, 4) to (2, 6) is 2 Left, 2 Up (4 steps).\n\nUP seems slightly better positioned for rapid consumption of the NW apples. Let's check dangers if I move UP to (3, 5).\n\nIf I choose UP to (3, 5):\nMy next move could target (3, 6) or (2, 5).\nIf E goes to (4, 6), they are still 1 unit away from me. If E goes to (5, 7), they are moving away.\n\nLet's focus on maximizing proximity to the closest apples that aren't immediately reachable. (2, 6) and (1, 5) are the closest cluster, 2 moves away minimum (3 steps). (7, 4) is 3 moves away minimum (3 steps).\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 5), I can realistically reach (2, 6) on Turn 4 if the enemy doesn't block me or force a significant diversion.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 4), I am committed to the Eastern side, reaching (7, 4) on Turn 5 (if optimal path).\n\nGiven the snake is short (length 2) and the enemy is short (length 1), aggression towards the closest apples is warranted, provided safety is maintained. UP seems to set up the best path to the nearest apple (2, 6).\n\nLong-term plan: Focus on clearing the NW apples (2, 6), (1, 5) first, then transition East towards (7, 4), (9, 3). Staying central is usually good for flexibility. (3, 5) keeps me reasonably centralized while moving towards a dense area of food.\n\nI select UP.\n\nLong-term note: Prioritize eating apples quickly to develop size advantage. Avoid engaging the enemy snake unless we are fighting over a necessary path segment, which is unlikely this early.\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

Body [(3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)].\n   Reaches the location just one step away from apple (1, 5) or (2, 6).\n   Distance to (2, 6) is 1 UP. Distance to (1, 5) is 1 LEFT. Very efficient positioning.\n   Safety check: None of E' positions (y=6, 7, 8) are near (2, 5). Safe.\n\n2. **Move UP to (3, 6)**.\n   New Head position (3, 6). Body [(3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)].\n   Distance to (2, 6) is 1 LEFT. Distance to (1, 5) is 2 LEFT. Less direct positioning than (2, 5).\n   Safety check: E' could move to (4, 6). If E moves to (4, 6), I am safe from immediate collision here.\n\n3. **Move RIGHT to (4, 5)**.\n   New Head position (4, 5). Body [(3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)].\n   This moves me away from the NW apple cluster and towards the center/East. Might set up a path to (7, 4) eventually, but the NW apples are closer.\n\nConclusion: Moving **LEFT** to (2, 5) places me optimally to eat either (1, 5) or (2, 6) on the next turn (Turn 4), depending on risk assessment then. This seems the most aggressive and effective path towards the nearest food.\n\nLong-term plan: Secure the NW apples (2, 6), (1, 5) aggressively. Maintain a safe distance from Snake #0, which seems currently focused upwards/inward but is short.\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

My snake did not eat an apple, length remains 3. New state: Head (2, 5), Body [(3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. Score remains 1.\n\nCurrent State (Beginning of Turn 4):\nMy snake (ID 1): Head: (2, 5), Body: [(3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)], Length: 4, Apples: 1.\nEnemy snake #0: Head: (4, 7), Body: [], Length: 1, Apples: 0.\n\nApples available: (9, 3), (7, 0), (2, 6), (1, 5), (7, 4).\n\nTargeting Strategy:\nMy move LEFT brought me adjacent to both apple (1, 5) and apple (2, 6). I used (2, 5) as a setup position.\n\nFrom (2, 5):\n1. To (1, 5): Requires 1 LEFT. This eats the apple (1, 5).\n2. To (2, 6): Requires 1 UP. This eats the apple (2, 6).\n\nClosest Safe Moves from (2, 5) [Body tails are (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]:\n1. UP to (2, 6). **EAT APPLE**. New Head (2, 6). Snake grows. Safe space around (2, 6) is manageable. Safe from current enemy location (4, 7).\n2. DOWN to (2, 4). **Collision!** (2, 4) is my tail segment. Dead. Move DOWN is impossible.\n3. LEFT to (1, 5). **EAT APPLE**. New Head (1, 5). Snake grows. Safe space around (1, 5) is manageable. Safe from current enemy location (4, 7).\n4. RIGHT to (3, 5). **Collision!** (3, 5) is my immediate previous body segment. Dead. Move RIGHT is impossible.\n\nEliminated Moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (to (2, 6)), LEFT (to (1, 5)). Both eat an apple and cause growth.\n\nEnemy Movement Prediction (Head at (4, 7)):\nPossible Enemy Heads (E'): (3, 7), (5, 7), (4, 6), (4, 8).\n\nComparing Option UP vs LEFT:\n*   **Move UP to (2, 6)**: Consumes (2, 6). New Head (2, 6). Body will be [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. The snake footprint now covers (2, 4) through (2, 6) vertically, and (1, 5) is still available next turn.\n*   **Move LEFT to (1, 5)**: Consumes (1, 5). New Head (1, 5). Body will be [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. The snake footprint now covers (1, 5) horizontally relative to (2, 5), and (2, 6) is still available next turn.\n\nBoth options secure food immediately and position well for the remaining apple in that cluster ((1, 5) or (2, 6)).\n\nIf I choose UP ((2, 6)), my next turn potential moves from (2, 6) are (1, 6), (3, 6), (2, 7). (1, 5) is adjacent (1 LEFT, 1 DOWN).\nIf I choose LEFT ((1, 5)), my next turn potential moves from (1, 5) are (0, 5), (2, 5) (body collision!), (1, 4), (1, 6). Wait, (2, 5) is the segment immediately behind the new head. If I move LEFT to (1, 5), my old head (2, 5) becomes Segment 2.\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 5): New Body: [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)].\nFrom (1, 5): Moving RIGHT takes me to (2, 5), which is the body segment now, so RIGHT is dangerous next turn if I don't move away or eat more. This suggests UP might be slightly safer for the *next* move's escape route, as the movement from (2, 6) to (2, 5) is not blocked by the new body shape.\n\nLet's analyze next turn safety for UP: Current move UP to (2, 6). New Head (2, 6). Body [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. Available apple: (1, 5).\nNext move options from (2, 6):\n1. DOWN to (2, 5) -> Success (eating (1, 5) next turn requires 1 LEFT).\n2. LEFT to (1, 6). Safe.\n3. UP to (2, 7). Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (3, 6). Safe.\nThe move DOWN to (2, 5) is safe because (2, 5) is the segment immediately behind the head, but if the tail moves up, it might not be blocked immediately. **Crucial Check**: In a non-eating move, moving to $H_{t-1}$ causes instant death. Since we are eating here, the tail won't move into the current head spot ($H_t$), but $H_{t+1}$ cannot move into $H_t$. My new head is (2, 6). The tail segment *that will be vacated* is (2, 4). If I move UP, my new head position (2, 6) is clear. In turn 5, if I move DOWN to (2, 5), that cell (2, 5) will be the segment $S_2$ in the body list, which is immediately behind the head $H_5$. This is *always* unsafe unless I eat. Wait, I must check the resulting body structure.\n\nIf UP is chosen (eat (2, 6)): New Body is Length 5. $H_{new} = (2, 6)$. $T_{old} = (2, 4)$ is removed. $B_{new} = [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]$.\nTurn 5, if I move DOWN to (2, 5): Collision with $S_2$. DEATH. So DOWN is forbidden next turn unless I eat.\n\nIf LEFT is chosen (eat (1, 5)): New Body is Length 5. $H_{new} = (1, 5)$. $T_{old} = (2, 4)$ is removed. $B_{new} = [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]$.\nTurn 5, if I move RIGHT to (2, 5): Collision with $S_2$. DEATH. So RIGHT is forbidden next turn unless I eat.\n\nBoth moves lead to a restriction (DOWN for the UP path, RIGHT for the LEFT path) on the subsequent move unless another apple is eaten. Since both apples are available and equally close, choosing UP seems marginal better as (2, 6) is slightly more central to future potential moves targeting (7, 4) or (9, 3) later, though both are edge positions. I will prioritize UP to (2, 6).\n\nEnemy avoidance: E' positions (3, 7), (5, 7), (4, 6), (4, 8). None are close to (2, 6). Safe.\n\nLong-term plan adjustment: Secure the NW corner cluster rapidly. Target (1, 5) next turn after eating (2, 6).\n\nNote: The previous analysis in the prompt stated my move LEFT resulted in Head (3, 5), Body [(3, 4), (2, 4)]. This contradicts the input board state provided for Turn 4, which shows Head (2, 5), Body [(3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. I rely on the current board state/my calculated move update (LEFT -> (2, 5)).\n\nI choose UP to eat (2, 6).\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nMy current head is (2, 5). I have immediate options to eat either (2, 6) by moving UP, or (1, 5) by moving LEFT. Both choices result in eating an apple and growing.\nIf I move UP to (2, 6), the resulting snake structure restricts a move STRAIGHT BACK DOWN to (2, 5) on the next turn (unless I eat again).\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 5), the resulting snake structure restricts a move STRAIGHT RIGHT to (2, 5) on the next turn (unless I eat again).\nBoth choices lock me in slightly for Turn 5. I choose UP to secure (2, 6) as it seems slightly less constricted relative to the board edge than (1, 5), setting up potentially better flanking movements toward (1, 5) or upward/rightward expansion. Enemy is not a threat here.\n**END RATIONALE**\nUP",

My snake grew to length 4, score 2 -> 3. New Head (2, 6), Body [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. The tail segment (3, 5) from the previous turn is now $S_2$. This confirmed my prediction that moving DOWN to (2, 5) would be collision (death) if I didn't eat.\n\nCurrent State (Beginning of Turn 5):\nMy snake (ID 1): Head: (2, 6), Body: [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)], Length: 5, Apples: 3. (Tail (2, 4) is the oldest segment, it moves if I don't eat).\nEnemy snake #0: Head: (3, 9), Body: [], Length: 1, Apples: 0.\n\nApples available: (9, 3), (7, 0), (1, 5), (7, 4), (4, 3).\nThe NW cluster now only has (1, 5) remaining, which is adjacent to my current head (2, 6) if I move diagonally, or directly accessible via LEFT then DOWN, or DOWN then LEFT.\n\nSafety Check (Current Head at (2, 6)):\n1. UP to (2, 7): Safe. (Open space)\n2. DOWN to (2, 5): **Collision!** (2, 5) is $S_1$. Death. (This was the predicted restriction).\n3. LEFT to (1, 6): Safe. (Open space)\n4. RIGHT to (3, 6): Safe. (Open space)\n\nEliminated Moves: DOWN.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. I must target apple (1, 5).\n\nTargeting (1, 5):\n*   Move LEFT to (1, 6): One cell too far (needs 1 DOWN next turn). If I move LEFT to (1, 6), then on Turn 6 I can move DOWN to (1, 5) and eat the apple.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (1, 6) this turn (T5), the tail (2, 4) moves to (2, 5). New Body: [(1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)].\n    *   If T6 I move DOWN to (1, 5) and eat: New Head (1, 5). Current body segment vacated is (3, 4). Safe.\n*   Move RIGHT to (3, 6): Moves away from the apple (1, 5). Not preferred.\n*   Move UP to (2, 7): Moves away from the apple (1, 5). Not preferred.\n\nThe move **LEFT** positions me perfectly for the apple (1, 5) on the very next turn (T6) without risking collision now. If I move LEFT to (1, 6), the tail (2, 4) moves to (2, 5), which is the cell I just vacated. Since I am *not* eating on T5, the tail position is vacated, and (2, 5) is safe to move into on T6 if necessary, but I plan to move $(1, 6) \\to (1, 5)$ which is safe.\n\nEnemy avoidance: Enemy head is at (3, 9).\nPossible E' positions: (2, 9), (4, 9), (3, 8). None are near me at (2, 6). Safe.\n\nI choose LEFT to set up the capture of (1, 5) on Turn 6.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Secure the remaining apple in the NW area ((1, 5)). After that, re-evaluate movement toward the remaining apples in the SE area: (9, 3), (7, 4), (4, 3), (7, 0). The snake is still relatively short (length 5), so moving across the board is manageable.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nMy current head is (2, 6). Moving DOWN leads to instant death against my own body segment (2, 5). The priority is to capture the last remaining apple in this local cluster, which is (1, 5).\nMoving LEFT to (1, 6) places me directly adjacent to (1, 5) on the required axis (Y=5). This guarantees eating the apple on Turn 6 if I move DOWN, and that move DOWN from (1, 6) to (1, 5) is safe because (1, 6) is not adjacent to my tail segment (2, 4) which will move to (2, 5) on Turn 5.\nThis move maintains safety and sets up the next immediate food acquisition.\n**END RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

Move executed: $(2, 6) \\to (1, 6)$.\nMy snake grew from length 5 to length 6 because I ate apple (1, 5) on Turn 6.\nNew Head: (1, 5). New Body: [(1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)].\n\nCurrent State (Beginning of Turn 6):\nMy snake (ID 1): Head: (1, 5), Body: [(1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)], Length: 6, Apples: 4. (Tail (2, 4) moves if I don't eat).\nEnemy snake #0: Head: (3, 9), Body: [], Length: 1, Apples: 0.\n\nApples available: (9, 3), (7, 0), (7, 4), (4, 3). (1, 5) was just eaten.\n\nSafety Check (Current Head at (1, 5)):\nThe backward move is UP to (1, 6), which is $S_1$. Moving UP immediately results in death.\n\n1. UP to (1, 6): **Collision!** (1, 6) is $S_1$. Death.\n2. DOWN to (1, 4): Safe (Open space).\n3. LEFT to (0, 5): Safe (Board edge, but safe).\n4. RIGHT to (2, 5): **Collision!** (2, 5) is $S_3$. Death.\n\nEliminated Moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\nTarget Analysis:\nThe remaining four apples are far to the East/South: (9, 3), (7, 0), (7, 4), (4, 3).\nMy snake is currently in the NW corner. Moving towards the E quadrant is necessary.\n\nOption A: Move DOWN to (1, 4).\nThis keeps me near the left edge, requiring a large movement later to cross to the E side. If I move DOWN to (1, 4), my tail (2, 4) moves to (2, 3).\nT7 options from (1, 4): (0, 4) [LEFT], (2, 4) [RIGHT, Safe since tail moved], (1, 3) [DOWN].\n\nOption B: Move LEFT to (0, 5).\nThis moves me to the left edge, but I will need to turn around to go East. If I move LEFT to (0, 5), my tail $(2, 4)$ moves to $(2, 3)$.\nT7 options from (0, 5): $(0, 4)$ [DOWN], $(0, 6)$ [UP]. RIGHT to $(1, 5)$ is now safe as $(1, 5)$ is no longer body and $(2, 5)$ is not body. No wait, $(1, 5)$ is currently empty, $(2, 5)$ is $S_3$ and remains body unless the next move moves the body segment that currently occupies $(2, 5)$ away from it. Since the tail moves, segments shift.\nIf T6: $(1, 5) \\to (0, 5)$. Old segments shift: $(1, 6) \\to (1, 5)$, $(2, 6) \\to (1, 6)$, $(2, 5) \\to (2, 6)$, $(3, 5) \\to (2, 5)$, $(3, 4) \\to (3, 5)$, $(2, 4) \\to (3, 4)$. New tail is $(3, 4)$.\nIf T7 I move RIGHT to $(1, 5)$, this is immediately adjacent to my old head $(1, 6)$, which is now $S_2$. It seems safe based on segment positions, but complex.\n\nComparing DOWN vs LEFT: DOWN moves me towards the bottom apples ((7, 0), (9, 3)) slightly faster relative to the current spread, and keeps me off the absolute edge, offering more directional flexibility for the next turn. Moving down towards Y=0 seems like a better geographical path toward the cluster near (7, 0) and (9, 3).\n\nEnemy avoidance: Enemy head (3, 9) is far away. Safe.\n\nI choose DOWN to start moving south/eastward toward the remaining apples.\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue navigating generally towards the densest cluster of apples in the SE quadrant ((9, 3), (7, 4), (4, 3)). Since the snake is now length 6, long distance travel is feasible. Priority is safety first, then efficient pathing. Moving down from (1, 5) leads to (1, 4), which opens up paths Eastward on future turns by moving RIGHT into (2, 4) or (2, 3) as the tail shifts appropriately.\n**END RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

Previous move: DOWN to (1, 4).\n\nCurrent State (Beginning of Turn 7):\nMy snake (ID 1): Head: (1, 4), Body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)], Length: 6, Apples: 4. (Tail (3, 4) moves if I don't eat).\nEnemy snake #0: Head $E_0$: (3, 9). Assuming Enemy #0 moved UP (to (3, 10) or (4, 9) or (2, 9) etc. based on its T6 move). Since there is no information on Snake #0's move from T6, I must assume it used a generic, safe move or I must infer its current position based on the board state provided for T7.\n\n*Revisiting previous turn's board state:*\nT6 Start Head: (1, 5). Board state *before* T6 move was shown:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 .

A . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nThe rationale stated my snake *ate* (1, 5) on T6 reacting to the move LEFT into (1, 5).\nMy move T6 was LEFT, from (2, 6) to (1, 6) in the rationale summary for T6 start, which contradicts the input/output structure. Let's re-examine the input for T6 start:\nT6 Start Head: (1, 6) (This must have been the head from T5).\nBody: [(2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. Apples: 3.\n\nMy actual T6 move was LEFT. (1, 6) -> (1, 5) (Eating apple at (1, 5)).\nNew Head: (1, 5). New Body: [(1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. Length 6. (Tail (2, 4) moves away).\n\nThe Rationale for T7 provided by the system used:\n*Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (1, 6), Body: [(2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)], Apples: 3. Enemy Head: (3, 9).*\nThis implies the system reverted to analyzing based on the move *before* the T6 move (i.e., analyzing T6 based on T5 state), or the state summary provided reflects the state *after* the T5 move but *before* the T6 move was executed and processed, and the T6 move LEFT was executed successfully and ate the apple (1, 5).\n\nThe Board State presented *at the start of Turn 7* (which I must use for my T7 decision) shows:\nHead: (1, 4). Body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)]. Length 6. Apples: 4.\nThis confirms the move LEFT on T6, eating (1, 5), and then the move DOWN on T7 (from (1, 5) to (1, 4)) happened *before* I made my T7 decision. This is highly irregular, as the input implies I am making T7 move based on the T7 state provided.\n\n**Assuming the provided T7 state is correct, and my previous move (executed between T6 and T7) was DOWN, resulting in Head (1, 4).**\nMy snake is length 6. Tail segment is (3, 4). If I don't eat, it moves.\n\nApples remaining: A = {(9, 3), (7, 0), (7, 4), (4, 3)}.\n\nSafety Check (Current Head at (1, 4)):\n1. UP to (1, 5): **Collision!** (1, 5) is $S_1$. Death.\n2. DOWN to (1, 3): Safe (Open space).\n3. LEFT to (0, 4): Safe (Board edge).\n4. RIGHT to (2, 4): Safe (Open space, since tail (3, 4) moves away, and (2, 4) is not currently occupied by body).\n\nEnemy Snake #0: Head $E_0$: (3, 9). We must infer its move from T6 to T7. Since no history is provided for its T6 move, we check the T7 map. The map only shows my snake and apples. **Crucially, the map does not show Snake #0.**\n\nIf the map is completely accurate as presented:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . T . . . . . . .\n 5 . A . . . . . . . . <-- (1, 5) is empty/apple region? Wait, my body is (1, 5).\n 4 . 1 . . . . . A . . <-- (1, 4) is my head. (7, 4) is A. Wait, (1, 5) is in my body list: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)].\n 3 . . . . A . . . . A <-- (4, 3) is A, (9, 3) is A.\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . . . . A . . <-- (7, 0) is A.\n\nVisual mismatch: The provided board state visualization uses 'T' for my body segments, but the coordinates listed for my body in the text DO NOT match the T placement precisely if T means 'my body segment'.\nMy Body: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4).\nBoard shows 'T' at (2, 6), (1, 6) [Wait, the map seems very confusing or outdated relative to the description].\n\nLet's rely EXCLUSIVELY on the textual description of the state:\nHead: (1, 4). Body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)]. Length 6.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 4), is it safe from my body?\nBody segments: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4). (2, 4) is NOT occupied. Safe from self.\n\nEnemy position: $E_0$: (3, 9). Since we don't know the enemy's move yet, we must assume the worst case or the most likely case if we are calculating the safety of the *current* potential move. Since the enemy move happens simultaneously, its movement direction *must* be considered.\n\nIf the enemy moved UP to (3, 10) (off map) or another direction, that determines safety. Since the board state for T7 *does not show* Snake #0, it implies Snake #0 has moved to a space that does not conflict with my current cell (1, 4) AND that I do not move into its path, *and* that it did not crash into my body.\n\nTarget Analysis:\nWe are low in the SW corner. Apples are in SE/S/E quadrants: (9, 3), (7, 0), (7, 4), (4, 3).\nWe need to travel generally East/South.\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN (1, 3), LEFT (0, 4), RIGHT (2, 4). UP (1, 5) is blocked by own body.\n\n1. Move DOWN to (1, 3): Continues south. If we follow the bottom edge, we reach A at (7, 0).\n2. Move LEFT to (0, 4): Moves to the edge. Requires a U-turn soon. Less efficient for eastward progress.\n3. Move RIGHT to (2, 4): Moves us one step closer to the center and the cluster of apples (4, 3), (7, 4). This seems like the best geographical progression towards the bulk of remaining fruit.\n\nEnemy considerations: $E_0$ at (3, 9). If $E_0$ moves RIGHT to (4, 9) or DOWN to (3, 8), we are safe from head collision if we move around (1, 4) -> (2, 4). If $E_0$ moves LEFT to (2, 9) or UP to (3, 10) (off board), we are safe. Because $E_0$ is so far away (Y=9 vs Y=4), head-on collision risk is negligible for our immediate move regardless of $E_0$'s T7 move, assuming $E_0$ is not suicidal (like moving off board or head-on into my new position if my body somehow blocks it). Since safety from my own body is established for RIGHT (2, 4), this is a strong candidate.\n\nChoosing RIGHT (2, 4) to move towards the densest apple cluster (4, 3), (7, 4).\nIf T8 I move RIGHT again to (3, 4), I hit my tail! Tail is currently at (3, 4).\nIf T7: (1, 4) -> (2, 4). Tail (3, 4) moves to (3, 3).\nIf T8: (2, 4) -> (3, 4). This is safe since the tail has moved off (3, 4). Great.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT towards (4, 3).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving Eastward towards the cluster of apples around Y=3, 4. Prioritize moving around the corner of the body segments around X=2/3 while moving East. Safety checking the immediate next move (T8) is critical here: Moving RIGHT places the head at (2, 4). On T8, moving RIGHT again to (3, 4) will be safe because the segment currently at (3, 4) will have moved to (3, 3).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move East until blocked by map edge or body, then adjust trajectory towards the nearest cluster of surviving high-ranking apples. Since we have 4 apples and the opponent has 0, safety is still paramount, but aggressive pursuit of fruit is justified. Following established paths that keep the immediate next step (T8) safe is good practice.\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Wait, the provided state doesn't match the previous rationale's chosen move (RIGHT). Let's re-evaluate the board state provided vs. where the previous move implies we should be, based on the explicit state given.\n\n**Re-evaluating Current State (T13)**\n\nBoard State provided:\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 5), Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)] -> This is the T7 state provided in the initial prompt for T8 analysis, not the T12 state corresponding to T13.\n\n**Crucial Observation:** The prompt provides the state *before* Turn 8's move, and then repeats the successful choice + rationale from T8, followed by the exact same move (RIGHT) again, implying this is the decision for T13 now.\n\nI must rely on the board state given *at the very top* of the prompt block, as that is explicitly labeled \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 5), Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)]\" for Turn 8. Since no intervening actual board state reflecting T9, T10, T11, T12 moves is provided, I MUST assume the game state provided at the very top is the state *before* my T13 decision, meaning T8, T9, T10, T11, T12 moves resulted in some configuration that led to the state given in the rationale block for T8 being the *actual move chosen*, and that the input state reflects the situation *before* the next move based on the T8 rationale's conclusion.\n\n**Let's strictly use the *LAST MOVE PICK/RATIONALE* to infer the current state if the initial state block appears outdated.**\n\nT8 Rationale confirmed move: RIGHT, leading to Head at (3, 4) if the snake did NOT eat on T8.\nT8 Rationale implies Score 4 and Body adjusted: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5)] if it HAD eaten (4 apples).\nThe problem description is extremely confusing because the initial state (T8 start) shows 3 apples, but the rationale for T8 implies 4 apples *after* T8.\n\n**Sticking to the input provided just before the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" section:**\nThis is the true starting point for Turn 8 evaluation (though we are making Turn 13 decision now):\nTurn: 8 / 150\nApples: (9, 3), (7, 0), (7, 4), (4, 3), (5, 1)\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 5), Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)] (3 apples)\nEnemy #0: Head: (2, 8)\n\nThe rationale chose RIGHT (moved to (4, 5) or (4, 4) depending on if it ate, assuming it moved to (4, 5) since it was aiming for (4, 3)).\nThe rationale claims the score became 4 *after* T8. This means the move RIGHT from (3, 5) landed on an apple. Which apple? (4, 3)? No, (4, 3) is too far. The only apple that could have been eaten by a move from (3, 5) is NOT visible. This implies the board state given for T8 is wrong relative to the expected move behavior in the rationale, or the rationale is based on a hidden state.\n\n**Since there is no current board state for T13, I must assume the LAST CHOSEN MOVE (RIGHT) executed successfully and apply it sequentially based on the T8 initial state, until I reach T13.**\n\n**Hypothetical Path based on T8 initial state ((3, 5), 3 apples) and Rationale's goal (move RIGHT, score improves to 4):**\n\nT8 Start: H=(3, 5), Body=[(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)]. Apples: 3. Target: (4, 3).\nMove T8: RIGHT. Assuming it ate Apple A, Head moves to (4, 5). New Score: 4. New Body: H=(4, 5), Body=[(3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)]. (Tail (1, 6) is retained).\n\nLet's look at apples: (9, 3), (7, 0), (7, 4), (4, 3), (5, 1). If the snake ate one, 4 remain. Which one was eaten? None of the listed apples are at (4, 5). This confirms the provided initial state and the rationale are internally inconsistent with the provided apple list.\n\n**I must use the RATIONALE's ending state description as the basis for the current turn (T13), as the input state block is for T8.**\n\nThe T8 rationale *ends* by selecting RIGHT.\nThe T8 rationale *justifies* a move based on a body configuration: Head (2, 4), Body: [(1, 4), ...], Score 4.\nThen the T8 rationale *claims* to choose RIGHT.\n\nThe final confirmed execution shown before this turn is:\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\nThis means T12 was RIGHT. T13 is the current turn. I must look at the board state *provided* at the very top, as that is the only objective data I have besides the move history.\n\n**Using the Initial Board State as Truth for Turn 13 (Assuming the T8 rationale described a move that brought the game to this point somehow):**\n\nTurn: 13 / 150 (Assuming the initial state provided is the ONLY reliable board data for *this* moment, despite the turn number discrepancy, because I have no other objective state.)\nApples: (9, 3), (7, 0), (7, 4), (4, 3), (5, 1)\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 5), Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)]. Apples: 3. (Length 4)\nEnemy Snake #0: Head: (2, 8). Length 1 or more, Body: none listed means L=1.\n\nOccupied cells (Self): (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6).\nEnemy Head: (2, 8).\n\n**Possible Moves from H=(3, 5):**\n1. UP to (3, 6): Safe.\n2. DOWN to (3, 4): Safe.\n3. LEFT to (2, 5): **Collision!** (Body segment)\n4. RIGHT to (4, 5): Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP (3, 6), DOWN (3, 4), RIGHT (4, 5).\n\n**Enemy Projection (E0 at (2, 8)):**\nE0 moves simultaneously from (2, 8). Since its body is 'none', it must move away (e.g., UP to (2, 9) or LEFT/RIGHT). It is far away. No immediate threat.\n\n**Apple Targets:** (4, 3), (5, 1), (7, 0), (7, 4), (9, 3). Closest seems around Y=3/4 area.\n\nCurrent position (3, 5) is slightly above the center mass of apples.\n\n*   **DOWN (3, 4):** Moves us quickly toward the X=4/Y=3/Y=1 cluster. This is a strong preparatory move.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 5):** Moves us further East, aiming for the Y=4 quadrant, setting up a path to (7, 4) or (9, 3).\n*   **UP (3, 6):** Moves away from the main action towards the top edge. Less desirable.\n\nComparing DOWN vs RIGHT:\nDOWN to (3, 4) allows a direct approach path to (4, 3) next turn (by going RIGHT to (4, 4) or DOWN to (3, 3)).\nRIGHT to (4, 5) is an aggressive move towards the right wall, but doesn't immediately commit to the closest low-Y targets.\n\nGiven the scarcity of apples, prioritizing immediate proximity to the closest (4, 3) seems reasonable. Moving DOWN sets up better geometry for approaching (4, 3) or (5, 1).\n\nLet's try **DOWN (3, 4)**.\nIf T13 is DOWN to (3, 4), body becomes $\\text{Body}_{new} = [(3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)]$. Tail $(1, 6)$ moves out.\n\nFuture check: From (3, 4), we can go RIGHT to (4, 4) on T14 to head towards (4, 3). This looks like a solid sequence.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue approaching the apples clustered around X=4/Y=3/Y=1. Ignore Snake #0 until it grows or moves closer.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Avoid.\n\nSince (4, 3) is the closest apple that seems reachable quickly from the current position (3, 5), moving DOWN to (3, 4) appears to be the most direct preparatory move.\n\n**Enemy Consideration (E0 at (2, 8)):**\nE0 is far north and unlikely to pose a collision threat this turn, regardless of its move, as its head is too far from our body segments (min distance (2,8) to (1,6) is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}$).\n\n**Conclusion:** DOWN is the best move to begin approaching the closest cluster of apples ((4, 3) and (5, 1)).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Maintain approach toward the lower-left apple cluster ((4, 3) and (5, 1)).

Follows the general direction of the cluster of apples below/right.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 3):** Safe from self-collision and board boundaries.

Safe from self-collision.\n\n**Enemy Analysis (Snake 0 at (4, 8)):**\nSince both snakes move simultaneously, we must predict $H_0$'s move. Snake 0 has 0 apples and is quite long; it will likely prioritize moving towards the highest concentration of apples, which seems to be the lower half of the board, or simply move towards the closest apple it can reach, possibly (7, 4) or elsewhere.\n\nIf $S_0$ moves to (4, 7) (DOWN), (3, 8) (LEFT), (5, 8) (RIGHT), or (4, 9) (UP).

New length: 5.\n\nThis is the optimal move: it scores, grows, and positions the snake well relative to the remaining apples (5, 1) and (7, 0).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nThe primary goal is to clear the lower-left cluster of apples: (4, 3) (just eaten), then (5, 1), and then (7, 0). After this turn, the next target should be (5, 1). We are now at (4, 3). Moving towards (5, 1) is favorable.

If RIGHT was chosen from (3, 3), the new body *after* eating should be:\n    *   New Head: (4, 3)\n    *   New Body: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5)] (The old head (3, 3) becomes the new second segment, length increases by 1, so the tail is preserved).\n    *   Length: 5. Score: 4.\n*   Apples ($A$): (9, 3), (7, 0), (7, 4), (5, 1), (8, 9)\n*   Enemy Snake 0 ($S_0$): Head ($H_0$): (4, 7), Body: none. (We must infer $H_0$'s previous move. If $S_0$ was at (4, 7) previously, it likely moved again. Since the board shows $H_0$ at (4, 7), we assume this is its current position after Turn 10 movement, though the map visualization shows '0' at (4, 7) which is unusual for a standard board display if the previous note said $H_0$ was at (4, 8). Looking closely at the ASCII map: '0' is at (4, 7).\n\nLet's trust the provided map visualization for the *current* state (Turn 11):\n**My Snake 1 (Score 4):** Head (4, 3). Body: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5)]. Length 5.\n**Enemy Snake 0 (Score 0):** Head (4, 7). Body: none. Length 1.\n\n**Occupied Cells ($O_1$):** (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5).\n\n**Target Apples:** The cluster seems to be moving S/SW. (5, 1) and (7, 0) are the next closest. (7, 4) is also available. (9, 3) is far.\n\n**Potential Moves from (4, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 4):** Safe from self. Moves toward (7, 4).\n2.  **DOWN (4, 2):** Safe from self. Moves toward (5, 1) and (7, 0).\n3.  **LEFT (3, 3):** Collision with own body segment. **Deadly.**\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 3):** Safe from self. Moves toward the right side, potentially setting up for (7, 4) or (9, 3).\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction ($H_0$ at (4, 7)):**\n$S_0$ is small and close to the center, near (7, 4). It is likely to target (7, 4) or perhaps move generally downwards towards the center mass of food.\nPossible $H_0$ moves: (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7), (4, 8).\n\n**Analysis of Safe Moves (Considering $S_0$ could move anywhere):**\n\n*   **UP (4, 4):** Safe. Puts us closer to (7, 4). If $H_0$ moves to (5, 7) or (3, 7), there is no immediate clash. If $H_0$ moves to (4, 6), we are safe.\n*   **DOWN (4, 2):** Safe. Targets the lower apples.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 3):** Safe. Does not immediately lead to an apple, but opens exploration space.\n\nThe snake is currently positioned well below the enemies. Prioritizing movement towards the dense cluster of lower apples ((5, 1), (7, 0)) seems strategic. Moving DOWN (4, 2) puts us in a good line for (5, 1) on the next turn (moving RIGHT to (5, 2) or DOWN to (4, 1), then RIGHT to (5, 1)).\n\nLet's evaluate DOWN (4, 2).\nNew positions after move: $H_1$: (4, 2). Body: (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5). Tail (2, 5) drops off since we didn't eat. Length 4. (Wait, this contradicts consuming 4 apples. If score is 4, length is 5. The body list provided only shows 4 segments following the head, implying length 5. Assuming the length is 5 upon eating, and we don't eat now, the tail drops).\n\n*If Score=4 means Length=5:*\nCurrent Body: [(H), B1, B2, B3, B4]. (5 segments total).\nIf we move DOWN to (4, 2) without eating: New body: [(4, 2), H=(4, 3), B1=(3, 3), B2=(3, 4), B3=(3, 5)]. The old tail, B4=(2, 5), is dropped. New Length 5.\n\nIf we move UP (4, 4) or RIGHT (5, 3), Same logic applies.\n\nLet's favor the path towards the nearest remaining low apple, (5, 1). Moving DOWN (4, 2) is the most direct tactical step towards that region, followed by (4, 1) or (5, 2).\n\nIf $H_0$ targets (7, 4) by going RIGHT -> (5, 7), our options remain open. If $H_0$ goes UP -> (4, 8), we are safe from collision.\n\nDOWN seems strategically sound for collecting the remaining low apples efficiently.\n\nLong-term plan: Clear apples (5, 1) and (7, 0). Then reassess position relative to (7, 4) and (9, 3), while keeping an eye on $S_0$ which is currently north of us.\n\nDOWN",

This move is suicidal.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves:** (4, 1), (3, 2), (5, 2).\n\n**Target Selection:**\nThe closest accessible apples are (5, 1) and (7, 0).

Since we haven't eaten this turn, the new body sequence will be: [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. Length remains 5. The segment (3, 5) drops off.\n\n2.  **Move LEFT to (3, 2):**\n    *   This moves us away from the lower apples towards the center left. Less direct.\n\n3.  **Move RIGHT to (5, 2):**\n    *   This moves us towards the center, but (5, 1) is still one step away diagonally, which is inefficient.\n\n**Enemy Prediction ($H_0$ at (3, 7)):**\n$S_0$ is small and far north. It will likely target the northernmost apple (8, 9) or move towards the closer middle apple (7, 4).\nIf $H_0$ moves UP to (3, 8), we are safe.\nIf $H_0$ moves LEFT/RIGHT to (2, 7) or (4, 7), we are safe.\nIf $H_0$ moves DOWN to (3, 6), we are safe.\n\nSince $S_0$ is far away, the primary constraint is self-preservation and maximizing apple collection paths. Moving DOWN to (4, 1) sets up the capture of apple (5, 1) on the next turn.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Prioritize movement towards the low cluster of apples (5, 1) and (7, 0). Avoid the immediate suicidal UP move. DOWN (4, 1) is the best tactical step toward (5, 1).\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (4, 1) to position for eating apple (5, 1) next turn. Then, proceed towards (7, 0).

If successful, my head will be at (4, 1), and the next target apple will be (7, 0). I must ensure the path to (7, 0) remains clear, avoiding getting boxed in by the bottom wall. Snake #0 is currently far away, allowing me priority focus on the closest, most accessible apples.\n\n---\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 14 Decision):**\n\nMy Head $H_1$: (4, 1) (This is where I moved last turn, as per history analysis, even though the provided input for *Last Move Pick* shows DOWN, the board state indicates the move took place and I am analyzing the *next* move).\n*Correction based on provided input:* The input states my *last* move was DOWN. If my previous head was (4, 2) (from turn 13 analysis context), moving DOWN results in a new head at (4, 1).\n\nLet's verify the board state against the provided input:\nTurn 13 Head: (4, 2). Body: [(4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)] (Wait, the provided body list is different from the analysis context in the *Last Rationale* provided, let's rely strictly on the current game state provided at the top.)\n\n**Current State (Start of Turn 15 analysis, since Turn 14 just finished):**\nThe prompt states \"Turn: 14 / 150\". This means we are deciding the move for Turn 14.\n\n*   **My snake (ID: 1) Head:** (4, 0)\n*   **My snake Body:** [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)] (Length 5, collected 4 apples).\n*   **Last Move Pick:** DOWN (This means the *decision made for Turn 13* was DOWN).\n\nIf the head was (4, 1) on Turn 13, and the move was DOWN, the head for Turn 14 starts at (4, 0). This matches the current state: Head (4, 0), Body starts with (4, 1).\n\n**Apples to Target:**\nA1: (9, 3), A2: (7, 0), A3: (7, 4), A4: (5, 1), A5: (8, 9).\n\nThe move needed *now* is for Turn 14. My head is at $H_1 = (4, 0)$.\n\n**Evaluating Moves for $H_1=(4, 0)$:**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 1):** Safe. This moves me onto the segment that was my head on Turn 13 (if I collected an apple last turn, which I must have to reach 4 apples). If moving UP lands on (4, 1), this is my own body segment. **Self-Collision: DEAD.** (Body list: (4, 1) is the second element).\n2.  **DOWN (4, -1):** Off board (Y= -1). **DEAD.**\n3.  **LEFT (3, 0):** Safe. Moves towards the bottom-left corner.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 0):** Safe. Moves towards the center/right side of the board.\n\n**Enemy Snake $H_0=(2, 6)$:**\n$H_0$ is far away. No immediate collision threat.\n\n**Move Selection based on immediate safety and proximity to apples:**\n\n*   Moves UP and DOWN are immediately fatal. We must choose LEFT or RIGHT.\n*   Apples are mostly in the upper right quadrants (A1, A3, A5) or far left middle (A2, A4). A4 is at (5, 1).\n\nIf I choose **RIGHT (5, 0)**:\nThis positions me one step horizontally closer to most apples, especially A4 (5, 1), allowing me to maneuver up towards it next turn.\n\nIf I choose **LEFT (3, 0)**:\nThis moves me away from all current apples, although it keeps me safe from the wall.\n\n**Decision:** Moving RIGHT to (5, 0) is the best option as it maintains safety and positions me most favorably for reaching the next accessible apple, A4=(5, 1), on the subsequent move (UP to (5, 1)).\n\n**Check sequence for RIGHT:**\nMove RIGHT: Head lands at (5, 0). Body becomes [(5, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)]. This is safe.\nNext turn target: (5, 1) [A4]. Move UP.\n\nThis seems like the correct path dictated by the immediate safety constraints.\n\nRIGHT",

Must check $H_0$. If $H_0$ moves to (5, 1), we die. $H_0$ is currently far in the bottom left (e.g., (0, 6)).

Unlikely to be hit by $H_0$.\n\n**Evaluation:**\nMoving UP to eat A4 at (5, 1) is the primary objective as it advances scoring and growth.\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 0) is safe but delays apple acquisition.\n\nGiven the vast distance between $H_1$ at (5, 0) and $H_0$ (last known at (0, 6)), it is highly improbable that $H_0$ can intercept $H_1$ at (5, 1) in this turn.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nIf $H_0$ was at (0, 6) last turn, its next move (Turn 17) could be:\n*   UP -> (0, 7)\n*   RIGHT -> (1, 6)\n*   DOWN -> (0, 5)\n\nNone of these paths intersect (5, 1). Therefore, moving UP to capture the apple is the clear optimal choice.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nGoal: Eat A4 at (5, 1). Move is UP. If successful, head moves to (5, 1), length increases to 6.\nNext targets after A4: A2 (7, 0) or A3 (7, 4).\nAfter eating A4, the head will be at (5, 1).\nIf we move UP:\n*   New Head: (5, 1). Snake grows. New body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)]. Tail (4, 3) remains (4, 3) this turn as we ate. (Wait, tail does not move if we eat. The body slides back, and the old head position becomes the new neck. The tail segment is retained unless we didn't eat). Since we eat, the length increases by 1, and the tail does not retract.\n\nLet's reconfirm body update after eating at (5, 1) from (5, 0).\nOld Body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)]\nNew Head: (5, 1)\nNew Body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)] (Length 6).

Body is safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 1):** Safe from body. Leads towards A0/A2 proximity.\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction for Turn 17:**\n$H_0$ at (1, 6). Possible moves: (1, 7), (2, 6), (1, 5), (0, 6). None seem immediately threatening to (6, 1) or its immediate neighbors (5, 1), (7, 1), (6, 2), (6, 0 - death).\n\n**Evaluation:**\nMoving LEFT to (5, 1) eats Apple A4 (5, 1). This increases score and length, which is highly advantageous.\nIf we move LEFT: New Head (5, 1). New Body: [(6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]. Length 6. Tail (4, 1) stays.\n\nMoving UP, RIGHT, or staying put (which is not an option) don't yield immediate gains. Capturing the closest apple is the best current strategy.\n\nMove LEFT to eat A4.\n\n**Next Move Plan (After eating A4 at (5, 1)):**\nHead will be at (5, 1). Body length 6.\nNext targets: A1 (7, 0) or A2 (7, 4).\nFrom (5, 1), A1 (7, 0) requires moving RIGHT, slightly DOWN. A2 (7, 4) requires moving RIGHT, significantly UP.\nI will likely head East, aiming for the cluster around x=7, then decide between y=0 and y=4.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nCurrent Head (6, 1). Move LEFT targets (5, 1) which is an Apple (A4).\nSafety check:\n1. UP (6, 2): Safe.\n2. DOWN (6, 0): Collision with body segment (6, 0). **Fatal.**\n3. LEFT (5, 1): Eats Apple A4. Safe from body. Enemy unlikely to intercept. **Optimal.**\n4. RIGHT (7, 1): Safe. Leads towards other apples but skips A4.\n\nMove LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

This contradicts the rationale analysis which assumed an apple was eaten to reach score 5, but aligns with the explicit state provided for Turn 19 initiation.\nIf score is 5, and the last move was LEFT to (5, 1), that means the apple at (5, 1) was NOT eaten, or the score reporting is slightly lagged/misaligned with the body length update regarding the last move.\n\nGiven the provided board state shows $H_1=(5, 2)$ and a length of 6 (Head + 5 body segments), and Score=5:\nThe tail of the snake (the last segment listed) must have moved on the *previous* turn (Turn 18).\nIf the snake was at Head (5, 1) at the start of Turn 18, and moved UP to (5, 2) this turn (Turn 19's move), then the snake at the start of Turn 18 must have had length 5 (4 segments). If it moved UP without eating, the body should shift and the tail drops off, resulting in a length 5 snake.\nIf the input state for Turn 19 (H=(5, 2), Body length 6, Score 5) is authoritative: The snake must have had length 6 at the *start* of Turn 18, and moved UP without eating an apple this turn (Turn 19).\n\n**Crucial Assumption:** I must base my current safety check on the explicit state provided for Turn 19 *before* I choose my move:\nHead $H_1$: (5, 2).

We need to estimate where $H_0$ moves. Since Snake #0 is currently very short (length 1), it will likely move towards the nearest apple or try to explore. The nearest apple is A1 (7, 0). Moving R, U, or D is possible. If it moves UP (1, 8) or RIGHT (1, 7), it stays far. If it moves DOWN (0, 6), it moves slightly closer to our current vicinity (around x=5). Given it has no body to worry about, it has high freedom. Assuming it also hunts apples:\n\nIf $H_0$ moves UP to (0, 8), it opens up space below it.\nIf $H_0$ moves RIGHT to (1, 7), it moves toward the center.\n\nSince $H_0$ is far (distance $\\approx 7$ horizontally and $5$ vertically), we don't need to prioritize avoiding it over reaching an apple.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (Manhattan Distance to nearest apples A1(7,0) or A2(7,4)):**\nCurrent (5, 2) -> Distances: A1: 4, A2: 3.\nMove UP (5, 3) -> Distances: A1: 5, A2: 2 (Targeting A2)\nMove LEFT (4, 2) -> Distances: A1: 5, A2: 3\nMove RIGHT (6, 2) -> Distances: A1: 3, A2: 3 (Best proximity trade-off)\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 2) positions us optimally for the next turn to target A1 (7, 0) or A2 (7, 4). If we reach (7, 0) or (7, 1) or (7, 2) or (7, 3) next turn, we are extremely close.\n\nStrategy: Take the move that optimizes geometry for apple capture while ensuring safety. RIGHT maximizes progress towards the closest concentration of apples (A1, A2).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue heading East towards the apples located on y=0, y=3, y=4, y=7. The immediate priority is taking A1 (7, 0) or A2 (7, 4). Next turn, if we move RIGHT, we aim for (7, 2) or (7, 1) or (7, 3) to set up the capture of A1 or A2. Snake #0 is not an immediate threat.\n\nRIGHT is the optimal choice.\nRIGHT",

It will move 1 step towards an apple or explore. Nearest apples are far: A3(7, 7) (Manhattan distance 6), A5(8, 9) (Manhattan distance 9).\nIf $H_0$ moves towards A3 (7, 7): likely UP/Northeast.

It also positions us one cell away from the axis containing A1 and A2.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (7, 2):\nNext turn opens up moving UP to (7, 3) or RIGHT to (8, 2). Moving to (7, 3) sets up a capture of A2(7, 4) next turn, or a good approach to A0(9, 3). Moving to (8, 2) sets up a capture of A1(7, 0) if $H_0$ moves away, or prepares for A0(9, 3).\n\nIf we move UP to (6, 3):\nNext turn opens up moving RIGHT to (7, 3) or RIGHT to (8, 3). This is one turn slower to reach the x=7 line than moving RIGHT now.\n\nRIGHT (to 7, 2) is the best move as it maximizes immediate progress towards the closest apples (A1 and A2).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move aggressively towards the cluster of apples around x=7 using Right and Up movements to reach (7, 3) or (7, 4) or (8, 2) next turn, aiming to eat A1 or A2 within the next 2-3 turns. Ensure safety by watching opponent movement relative to my intended path, though distance is currently large.\n\nRIGHT",

Since it's short, it explores, often moving towards nearest accessible target or expanding. Given the distance to A3, we are not in immediate danger of collision on the center/right side of the board.\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\nCurrent (7, 2).\n1. **UP to (7, 3):** Distance to A2(7, 4) is 1.

Less direct than UP or DOWN.\n\nWe have two excellent options: UP towards A2 or DOWN towards A1.\n\nA2 is at (7, 4). A1 is at (7, 0). Both are on the same column as our current head position (7, 2).\n\nIf we move **UP to (7, 3)**:\nNext turn, we move UP to (7, 4) and eat A2. $H_1$ length becomes 7.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (7, 1)**:\nNext turn, we move DOWN to (7, 0) and eat A1. $H_1$ length becomes 7.\n\nBoth moves yield an apple next turn and keep us safe. Eating A2 gives us access to A3(7, 7) eventually, while A1 is further from other immediate apples (A0 is at (9, 3)). A2 seems slightly better positioned for future clearing of the center/right apples.\n\nChoosing **UP (7, 3)** to target A2(7, 4).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move UP to (7, 3) now, then UP to (7, 4) next turn to collect A2.

Note: The body list in the prompt reflected the state *before* collecting the apple that resulted in the move to (7, 2). The move UP to (7, 3) was projected in the last move's rationale, which means we are now checking moves *from* (7, 3). Waiting, the prompt shows that the *last move* resulted in the current state.\n\nLet's re-verify the state based on the prompt:\nPrevious Head was (7, 2).\nLast move chosen was UP.\nIf the move UP succeeded, the new head is (7, 3).\nThe previous body/length was 6 segments long (5 apples collected).\nIf the snake collected an apple on the move to (7, 2), its length increased to 6.\nThe prompt shows:\nHead: (7, 3)\nBody: [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1)]\nApples collected: 5.\n\nThis implies my interpretation of the *last move information* section might be slightly misaligned if that section was describing the decision *leading to* the current board state.\nIf the board state is accurate:\nHead $H_1$: (7, 3). Length is 5 segments + Head = 6 total segments. Score 5 apples. Tail is (6, 1).\nThe body list confirms this: [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1)]. This is 5 segments following the head (7, 3). Total length 6.\n\nLet's check the last move rationale provided:\nThe rationale concluded: \"Choosing **UP (7, 3)** to target A2(7, 4).\"\nIf UP was chosen, and the snake collected an apple, the length should increase by 1.\nState before last move (Turn 21 start, based on rationale): Head (7, 2), Length 6 (5 apples).\nIf the move UP to (7, 3) was chosen, and an apple was *not* collected at (7, 3), the length remains 6. Body: [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0)]. Tail (6, 0).\nThe current board state shows Head (7, 3) and Body size 5. This means the snake *lost* a segment, which only happens if it didn't eat an apple *and* had a length > 1 (which it does). Wait, in standard snake, length only changes when eating. If not eating, the tail moves one spot forward, maintaining length.\n\nLet's assume the provided *Current State* information is definitively correct for the start of Turn 22, regardless of the provided \"Last Move Pick\" which often reflects the *chosen move* of the previous turn, not necessarily the resulting state if the apple eating mechanics are complex or if the last move information was slightly stale relative to the actual outcome reflected in the current state.\n\n**Current State for Turn 22 Analysis:**\n$H_1$: (7, 3).\nBody (Tail is last element): $B_1 = \\{(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1)\\}$. Length 6.\nTail: (6, 1). (The segment (6, 1) is the tail segment in the list provided, but structurally, if it hasn't eaten, the tail segment *before* the move would slide to the position of the segment behind (6, 1) from the previous turn. Given the list structure Head -> Tail, the segment (6, 1) is the tail).\nApples: 5.\n\nApples: A(9, 3), A(7, 0), A(7, 4), A(8, 9), A(7, 7).\n\nEnemy $H_0$: (0, 6). Length 1.\n\n**Safety Check for $H_1=(7, 3)$:**\nPossible next positions:\n1. **UP (7, 4):** Inside board. **Apple A(7, 4) is here.** Safe from self. Safe from $H_0$. (This was the target in the previous rationale).\n2. **DOWN (7, 2):** Collision with body segment (7, 2). **FATAL.**\n3. **LEFT (6, 3):** Inside board. Safe from self. Safe from $H_0$.\n4. **RIGHT (8, 3):** Inside board. Safe from self. Safe from $H_0$.\n\nThe move **DOWN (7, 2)** is blocked by the segment immediately behind the head (7, 2). This means the standard \"moving backwards\" rule applies here, and it is generally fatal unless the snake is length 1 (which it is not).\n\nSafe Moves: UP (7, 4), LEFT (6, 3), RIGHT (8, 3).\n\n**Enemy Projection (Snake #0):**\n$H_0$ is at (1, 6). Extremely short. It is unlikely to threaten us immediately unless we stray far toward the left wall.\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\nCurrent Head (7, 3).\n1. **UP to (7, 4):** Eats A(7, 4). Length increases to 7. Excellent move. Sets up for A(7, 7) next.\n2. **LEFT to (6, 3):** Distance to A(7, 4) is 1 (diagonal), A(9, 3) is 3. Not as direct.\n3. **RIGHT to (8, 3):** Distance to A(9, 3) is 1. Eats A(9, 3) next turn if we move towards it (e.g., RIGHT -> RIGHT).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT look very strong.\n\nOption 1: UP to (7, 4). Collect Apple $A_2$. New Head (7, 4). Tail slides from (6, 1) to (7, 2).\nFuture targets: A(7, 7), A(9, 3). (7, 4) is directly on the path towards (7, 7).\n\nOption 2: RIGHT to (8, 3). Collect Apple $A_0$ next turn if we manage another successful move toward it. New Head (8, 3). $H_1$ is now closer to A(9, 3). Tail slides from (6, 1) to (7, 2).\n\nSince we just moved to (7, 3) (presumably, if we trust the last rationale's target selection), we were aiming for the apple at (7, 4). Moving UP achieves this immediate goal, maintains a vertical line of apples A(7, 0), A(7, 4), A(7, 7), and keeps us centralized enough.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move UP to collect the apple at (7, 4). This move is safe and directly progresses towards clearing the cluster of apples aligned vertically on column 7.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move UP to (7, 4) and consume the apple. If safe, next target is A(7, 7). If A(7, 7) becomes too far or blocked, pivot towards A(9, 3) or A(8, 9). Ensure Snake #0 remains non-threatening.\n\nUP",

Length 7. Tail is (6, 1).\nApples remaining: $A = \\{(9, 3), (7, 0), (8, 9), (7, 7), (8, 4)\\}$.\n\nEnemy $H_0$: (0, 7). (The board shows '0' at (0, 7). $H_0$ moved from (0, 6) to (0, 7) if the board state reflects the result of Turn 22). Length 1.\n\n**Safety Check for $H_1=(7, 4)$:**\nPossible moves from (7, 4):\n1. **UP (7, 5):** Safe.\n2. **DOWN (7, 3):** Collision with body segment (7, 3). **FATAL.**\n3. **LEFT (6, 4):** Safe.\n4. **RIGHT (8, 4):** **Apple $A(8, 4)$ is here.** Safe from self.\n\nSelf-collision DOWN (7, 3) rules out moving backwards.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (7, 5), LEFT (6, 4), RIGHT (8, 4).\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\nWe just cleared (7, 4).\nRemaining relevant apples are A(7, 0) (down), A(7, 7) (up), A(9, 3) (right/down), A(8, 9) (far top right).\n\n1. **RIGHT to (8, 4):** Eats $A(8, 4)$. Score becomes 7. New head (8, 4). Tail slides from (6, 1) to (7, 3).\n   * Goal A(9, 3) is now 1 step away (RIGHT). This looks very promising for clearing the bottom right section.\n\n2. **UP to (7, 5):** Safe move. Next target could be A(7, 7). Distance 2.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 4):** Moves away from all immediate apples, unless setting up a detour, which seems unnecessary now.\n\nMove RIGHT to (8, 4) eats an apple and positions us perfectly to grab A(9, 3) next turn (by moving RIGHT again). This clears consecutive apples efficiently.\n\n**Enemy Projection (Snake #0):**\n$H_0$ is at (0, 7). It is very small and far away. We don't need to sacrifice immediate scoring opportunities for evasive maneuvers toward the center/right side of the board unless $H_0$ somehow grows rapidly. As it is length 1, it poses no immediate threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move RIGHT to consume the apple at (8, 4). This is safe and leads directly to the next nearby apple at (9, 3).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Target A(9, 3) next. If A(9, 3) is eaten, assess whether to target A(7, 0) or A(7, 7). Given the central location of the body, moving towards A(9, 3) seems strategically sound for continuing to clear apples in the bottom/right quadrant first.\n\nRIGHT",
