That leaves only RIGHT (to (3,0)) and UP (to (2,1)) as safe moves.\n\nThere are several apples on the board: (7,2), (8,1), (8,2), (7,7), and (7,1). The apple at (7,1) is the closest in Manhattan distance \u2013 from (2,0) it\u2019s 5 steps to the right plus 1 step upward (|7\u20132|+|1\u20130|=5+1=6). Notice that if we move UP to (2,1), we are immediately aligned with the row holding not only (7,1) but also (8,1); this makes it easier to travel horizontally toward that apple.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief \u201cwhat if\u201d on our move choices:\n\u2022 If we go RIGHT to (3,0), our Manhattan distance to (7,1) becomes |7\u20133|+|1\u20130| = 4+1 = 5, which is also good\u2014but then we\u2019d still need to move UP later to line up with the apples.\n\u2022 If we go UP to (2,1), the distance becomes |7\u20132|+|1\u20131| = 5+0 = 5, and we\u2019re immediately in the correct row to make a straight run rightward.\n\nSince both moves are safe and yield the same distance to our target apple, the UP move offers the advantage of aligning our snake\u2019s head with the row where two apples lie. This should make our route toward the apple (or even the cluster of (7,1) and (8,1)) more straightforward while reducing the risk of self-collision later.\n\nThus, my next move will be: UP."

For example, apple (7,7) is only 1 column to the right and 5 rows up from our head. Moving UP (to (6,3)) reduces the vertical gap to (7,7) and keeps us in relatively open territory. In contrast, moving LEFT (to (5,2)) increases our distance to the key cluster of apples on the right. Also, by going UP we steer further away from the enemy\u2014which is lingering around the lower right portion of the board.\n\nSo, even though both UP and LEFT are safe immediately, moving UP is strategically better: it preserves more maneuvering space toward the apples (like (7,7) and (7,8)) and avoids any risky confrontations with the enemy snake\u2019s body which is blocking the right.\n\nStrategy note for next turn:\nI\u2019ll re\u2010evaluate the board after moving UP.

However, none of our nearby apples lie above; the attractive apple at (3,8) would still remain to our left.\n\u2022 Going RIGHT would bring our head to (8,8), which is safe\u2014but that moves us away from the appealing apple at (3,8) (and toward apples (8,5) or (9,5), with the latter too close to the enemy).\n\u2022 Moving LEFT takes us directly toward (3,8). Stepping left to (6,8) immediately reduces our distance to the apple on the same row. From (6,8) we can continue left until we get the apple.\n\nGiven our snake\u2019s current shape (head at (7,8) and body at [(7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5)]), moving LEFT is both safe and positions us for an easy path toward the apple.\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is: LEFT."

Notice that three apples are on the left side of the board (especially (0,9)) while the apple (5,6) is on the lower/right\u2010side\u2014but that one lies very near the enemy snake (whose head is at (7,6)). Since our enemy is larger, we\u2019d rather avoid any race or head\u2013to\u2013head risks.\n\nLooking at our options from (3,8):\n\n\u2022 RIGHT isn\u2019t allowed because (4,8) is already part of our body.  \n\u2022 DOWN would start steering us toward the (5,6) apple, but that apple is a potential contest zone with enemy snake #0.  \n\u2022 LEFT would move us horizontally toward (0,9), but then our head would still be in row 8\u2014just one row below the top where apple (0,9) sits.  \n\u2022 UP moves our head to (3,9), placing us directly in the top row. Since apple (0,9) is at the far left on row 9, once we go UP we can plan to travel left along the top row (i.e. (2,9) then (1,9) and finally (0,9)) without any interference from our own body.\n\nBecause (0,9) is uncontested by the enemy and gives us potential access to a chain of apples along the left edge of the board, moving UP keeps us safe and on target.\n\nMy short\u2010term strategy is to head toward (0,9) (by moving UP now, then left in subsequent turns) and avoid the enemy\u2013contested lower area near (5,6).\n\nNext move: UP."
