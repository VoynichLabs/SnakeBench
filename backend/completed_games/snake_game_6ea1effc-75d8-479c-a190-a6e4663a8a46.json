Apple positions relative to the snake:\n   - (0, 6) to the left: Closest apple.\n   - (3, 9) and (3, 8) upwards and to the right.\n   - (1, 5) downwards.\n   - (7, 2) to the right and downward.\n   \nGiven the board's configuration:\n- Moving LEFT to (0,6) would immediately earn a point by eating the apple, thus the most immediate benefit.\n- Moving UP, RIGHT, or DOWN does not directly lead to an apple on the next move, although RIGHT aims towards two apples at (3, 9) and (3, 8). However, this path is not direct, requiring multiple moves, and could potentially introduce risk if the snake grows longer and needs to maneuver back without hitting itself.\n\nConsidering the facts:\n- LEFT does not pose any immediate threats like walls or the enemy snake.\n- The enemy snake is located far at the bottom right (9, 0) and hence out of immediate concern for confrontational strategy.\n  \nStrategy for future:\n- Once the apple at (0, 6) is eaten, consider moving RIGHT to approach the apple at (1, 5) unless more pressing opportunities or threats arise.\n- Need to monitor the growth of the snake as longer snakes require careful handling to avoid self-collision.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**. This move is optimal for an immediate gain and poses no immediate risk."

Also, moves away from most apples.\n- **LEFT**: Not possible as it would collide with the wall.\n- **RIGHT** to (1, 6): This leads towards the nearest apple at (1, 5) and puts us in a good position for future moves both north and east towards other apples.\n\n**Strategy for Future**:\n- Upon moving RIGHT and consuming the apple at (1, 5) next, planning should involve evaluating the path to the densely located apples at (3, 8) and (3, 9). It might require some maneuvering to safely reach these while also watching the growth of the snake\u2019s size which could introduce some self-collision risks.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**. This move strategically makes sense to capture the nearest apple and prep for subsequent moves towards other distant apples."
