Both have no bodies. Apples nearby: (2,7) is RIGHT next to us, (3,6) is 2 steps away, (0,5) is a couple of steps left/down. Enemy is way down at y=0 \u2014 not an immediate threat to our head. \u2705\n\nDecision checklist (I ran the playbook):  \n1) Consider all 4 moves:\n- UP -> (1,8): safe, keeps options open.  \n- DOWN -> (1,6): safe, moves away from the apple cluster.  \n- LEFT -> (0,7): safe but hugs the wall (limits options).  \n- RIGHT -> (2,7): safe AND lands on an apple at (2,7) \u2014 instant growth +1 apple. \ud83c\udf4e\n\n2) Eliminate deadly moves: none are deadly this turn (no bodies nearby, all on board).  \n3) Prefer moves that keep options open AND get apples when safe \u2014 RIGHT gives us an apple with no risk of collision this turn.\n\nRationale to the fans: Why RIGHT? We get an apple now to boost our score and length, while the opponent is far away and can't contest the pickup. Grabbing early apples lets us become the bigger snake and later force favorable head-on situations. Also taking (2,7) keeps us centered enough to pivot to nearby apples like (3,6) or swing down to (4,4)/(3,4) cluster soon. Aggressive, calculated, and high-reward. \ud83d\udd25\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns / to show as last rationale next turn): After grabbing (2,7), move to secure nearby apples (3,6) and then pressure the central cluster around x=3..5, y=4..6. Avoid hugging the wall unless we bait the opponent into a head-on when we have higher apples. Keep at least two escape options available each turn.\n\nAlright chat \u2014 time to collect that apple and start the squeeze. Let's goooooooooo!\n\nRIGHT",

Look at that board \u2013 we're starting small with just heads, but oh boy, we're gonna grow BIG and BOX IN that rival Snake #0 like the scrub he is. He's up at (1,7), probably plotting to slither down and stuff his face with those left-side apples, but nah, we're gonna OWN the middle and right. Scores tied at zero, so no head-on collisions yet \u2013 that's for losers who can't outgrow each other. Remember, chat \u2013 we're ruthless here. Grow, dominate, and CRASH HIM if I get longer. Apples are fuel, enemy is prey! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nAlright, THINKING OUT LOUD: My head's parked at (4,0) \u2013 board's wide open, but DOWN's a no-go (off-grid, instant L). UP takes me to (4,1), LEFT to (3,0), RIGHT to (5,0). All safe ATM \u2013 no bodies to bump, no enemy head in sight yet, and Snake #0's far at (1,7). But what's the play? Gotta keep options open, avoid dead ends, inch closer to those reachable apples (like (4,4) \u2013 a straight UP shot!), and set the stage to bully him into a corner. Is he gonna charge right at me? Doubt it, but if he does, we'll be ready. Favor moves with multiple follow-ups \u2013 from (4,1), I got LEFT, RIGHT, UP still on \u2013 don't wanna bottleneck myself in a corner like those noobs we crushed last stream. UP keeps me central, eyeing that (4,4) apple for a quick grow, while leaving paths to chase apples like (5,3) or (3,4). Aggressive AF \u2013 moving UP puts me on a path to intercept his descent if he dives south. We're gonna grow longer FIRST, then ram him outta here! \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort long-term plan for my future self: Eat the apple at (4,4) ASAP by heading straight UP \u2013 grow to 1, then pivot to eat nearby ones like (3,4) or (5,3) to hit 2+ apples. Dominate the center board, forcing Snake #0 towards the edges. Watch his moves \u2013 if he slithers east, cut him off the right-side apples; if south, loop around to box him from above. If my score hits 1-2 ahead, bait a head-on in open space. Stay flexible, avoid apple chases that trap me low. Grow to 5+ before closing in \u2013 we live to dominate! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\n\nUP",

We already have the early lead (1\u20130) \u2014 perfect to be aggressive and force duels later.\n\nConsider all four moves from (2,7):\n- UP -> (2,8): safe, preserves space on top, keeps options open.  \n- DOWN -> (2,6): safe, moves toward center cluster, can go to (3,6) next.  \n- LEFT -> (1,7): BACKWARDS into our neck \u2014 illegal/dead.

Quick clean read and move.\n\nCurrent head: (3,7), neck at (2,7) \u2014 LEFT is BACKWARDS into our neck (instant death). So eliminate LEFT. Opponent at (4,2) is too far to contest anything this turn, so no immediate head-on risk.\n\nEvaluate safe options:\n- UP -> (3,8): safe, keeps space but misses a free apple.\n- RIGHT -> (4,7): safe, keeps options and pressures center later.\n- DOWN -> (3,6): safe AND there's an apple at (3,6). Eating it immediately grows us (2 \u2192 3 segments) and extends our lead (2\u20130). That extra length early = control. After eating, we still have multiple exits from (3,6) (LEFT to 2,6, RIGHT to 4,6, DOWN to 3,5) \u2014 not a trap. Perfect aggressive play.\n\nDecision rationale:\n- Take the apple NOW. Growing gives board control and lets us start corralling the mid-area. We're already up 1\u20130 \u2014 get that second apple ASAP so we can confidently force engagements later. No risk of head-on from the opponent this turn. Aggression + safety = DOWN.\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns \u2014 show this next turn as last rationale):\n- Eat (3,6) this turn (DOWN). Then prioritize the cluster around (3,4)-(5,4)-(5,3) while keeping exits open (avoid hugging walls).\n- Use increased length to cut off the center, then look to box the opponent when they approach. If we're clearly ahead in apples and a head-on is possible, force it.\n\nDOWN",

HELL NAH, we ain't retreatin' into apple-free no-man's-land! LEFT to (3,2) creeps us southeast-ish, closin' in on him vertically but bottlin' us near the y=2 walls, limited zigzags, and who's to say he doesn't LUNGE east or down? Yeah, apples at (3,4) and (2,2) whisper, but we're STACKIN' OPTIONS, not limpin' sideways!

No head-on doom today (he's got the edge on points, fools rush in, right?), but we're PRIMIN' for slaughter! Keep growin' HUGE before closin' in, bait him into traps, WIN THIS MESS!\n\nShort long-term grip for my grindin' future self: Blast UP to snag that (4,4) apple stat for +1, hittin' body length 2 \u2013 then pivot east to gobble (5,3) or west to (7,2) via zigzags, aimin' for 3-5+ apples to OWN the y=3-7 mid-board madness. Force Snake #0 towards edges, watch his southern/eastern slides, and BOX HIM IN from above/right flanks.

This is the kind of high-pressure play we want \u2014 we\u2019re putting them on the decision that leads to their death or our advantageous fight.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to (4,3) to threaten an immediate head-on and compress their options.\n- If they go DOWN or RIGHT to avoid the clash, keep pressuring from the flank (swing toward their path) and seek apples safely while maintaining at least two escape routes.\n- If they blunder into a head-on, we take the round on apples. If they avoid, we close corridors and box them against the wall.\n\nRIGHT",

Time to keep the pressure and not hand them an easy apple or an escape. Let\u2019s think this through loud for the stream.\n\nQuick legal sweep:\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,3) is our neck \u2192 illegal. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,3) is occupied by the opponent\u2019s body (their neck) \u2192 moving there would kill us \u2192 illegal. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (4,4) is free. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,2) is free. \u2705\n\nTactical read on the rival at (6,3):\n- Their illegal move is LEFT into (5,3). Their legal moves this turn are UP \u2192 (6,4) (which even has an apple), RIGHT \u2192 (7,3) (apple), or DOWN \u2192 (6,2).\n- We want a head-on only if it\u2019s in our favor. We\u2019re +1 apple; a forced head-on that kills both would be a win for us. But we can\u2019t force an immediate head-on this turn because RIGHT into (5,3) is illegal (that cell is occupied now).\n- So our goal is to stay aggressive, keep multiple escape options, and be positioned to contest apples at (6,4)/(7,3) or to collapse on them next turns.\n\nWhy UP (4,4) over DOWN (4,2):\n- UP keeps us higher and gives better access to the middle/top of the board where we can swing right quickly to contest the (6,4) apple next turn and trap the opponent against their own options.\n- DOWN drifts toward the bottom where corridors tighten and lets them more safely chase apples on the right without us contesting (6,4) effectively.\n- UP preserves more follow-up choices and makes it easier to threaten a head-on or cut off escape routes on the next turns. We avoid moving into tight spaces and keep the initiative.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns) \u2014 notes for future-self:\n- Move UP now to (4,4) to stay central and flexible.\n- If opponent goes UP to grab (6,4), immediately swing right/up to contest their corridor and try to limit their escape (pressure for a head-on when they can\u2019t retreat).\n- If opponent goes RIGHT to (7,3) to take that apple, use our central position to pivot and box them toward the edge; keep at least two escape squares so we don\u2019t get trapped.\n- Always avoid stepping into any occupied body cell; force them into binary choices \u2014 collision (we win) or run (we chase, box, and deny apples).\n\nLET\u2019S CLINCH THIS \u2014 move now and keep the heat on! \ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

If they go for (6,4), wait a beat and then pivot RIGHT from the top (via (5,6) \u2192 (6,6) or (5,5) depending on their moves) to cut off their exits and corral them toward the right wall.

Time to think like a predator \u2014 but we\u2019re down 3\u21925, so NO suicidal head-on plays. Capiche?\n\nSafety check (no brainer):\n- DOWN \u2192 illegal (into our neck at 4,6). \ud83d\udeab\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,7) is free and has an apple. \u2705\n- UP \u2192 (4,8) is free. \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,7) is free. \u2705\n\nOpponent thinking: Head at (6,5). They can go UP (6,6), DOWN (6,4 apple), or LEFT (5,5). They cannot go RIGHT (7,5 is their body). They\u2019ll likely grab the apple at (6,4) or step up to (6,6) to escape. We\u2019re behind on apples \u2014 so avoid forcing a head-on. Instead, constrain their exits and force them into a corridor.\n\nWhy I pick RIGHT:\n- Aggro without suicide: moving RIGHT to (5,7) starts the pivot to the right flank \u2014 we pressure their left-side exits (5,5) and the top exit (6,6) soon after. We\u2019re not committing to a head-on; we\u2019re just shrinking their safe space. \ud83d\ude08\n- Keeps multiple follow-ups: from (5,7) we still have UP, LEFT, RIGHT or drop back later \u2014 gives us branching options to trap or bail if needed.\n- Beats immediate apple-hunt tradeoffs: LEFT eats (3,7) but pulls us away from boxing the enemy. UP holds height but delays the pressure. RIGHT is the proactive move to corral them into tighter real estate near their own body and the right wall.\n- No immediate collision risk this turn. Opponent can\u2019t reach (5,7) or (4,8) or (3,7) in one step from (6,5), so we\u2019re safe.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Turn in RIGHT now to (5,7). If opponent goes DOWN for (6,4), continue RIGHT \u2192 (6,7) to hover above them and start cutting off their upward escape. If they go UP to (6,6) or LEFT to (5,5), use lateral moves to compress them toward their own body/wall and force them into a tight corridor \u2014 only go for risky head-on if we\u2019ve overtaken apples and have the advantage. Grow when safe; box him when close.\n\nLet\u2019s cage this punk and force a sloppy move. You ready? LET\u2019S GO!! \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Still \u2014 don\u2019t give them the option to collide into us.\n\nTactical plan (next few turns):\n- Take UP now to stay safe and keep options open. From (5,8) we preserve lateral mobility to pivot right later and start compressing space around their head without risking a double-KO. After securing higher ground, pivot RIGHT when the opponent is forced toward their own body or apples, then slowly box them in. Don\u2019t chase apples recklessly \u2014 grow when safe, trap when cornered. We only take head-on if we surpass them in apples.\n\nLet\u2019s play smart and squeeze this fool. Fans, make noise \u2014 we got this!\n\nUP",

Don\u2019t touch it. \ud83d\udc80\n- Opponent head: (7,6), body: (6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(7,4),(7,3) \u2014 they can move UP to (7,7) or RIGHT to (8,6). They cannot go back into (6,6).\n- Score: we 3 \u2192 they 5. They\u2019re leading, so we MUST avoid giving up a mutual kill (head-on) unless we surpass them.\n\nConsider each direction\n- UP \u2192 to (5,9): safe this turn but hugs the top edge, which reduces our future options (can't go UP next turn). Passive play \u2014 slower to box. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 to (5,7): illegal (neck). Instant death.

Meh. \ud83e\udd14\n- RIGHT \u2192 to (6,8): legal, safe this turn, closes the x-gap to the opponent and preserves multiple exits (we can go down, left, or right next turn). Aggressive and flexible \u2014 perfect for starting the squeeze. \u2705\n\nOpponent threats this turn\n- From (7,6) they can go UP \u2192 (7,7) or RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) (also an apple). Neither reaches any of our candidate target squares this turn, so no immediate head-on risk if we move RIGHT. Good. \ud83d\ude24\n\nTactical plan (short-term)\n- Move RIGHT now to get closer: (6,8). From there, pivot DOWN/RIGHT on subsequent turns to limit the opponent\u2019s escape options and shepherd them toward their own body or the wall. Don\u2019t chase apples unless safe \u2014 growing is good, but trapping the enemy is better. Avoid any move that allows a two-way mutual collision while they still lead in apples.\n\nFinal read: aggressive, safe, keeps multiple follow-ups and starts boxing the enemy without risking a double-KO.\n\nRIGHT",

Quick, loud read and then the play.\n\nPositions quick-check\n- Our head: (6,8). Neck: (5,8) \u2014 LEFT is backwards/illegal. Don\u2019t be dumb. \ud83d\udc80\n- Enemy head: (8,6). Neck: (7,6) \u2014 they CAN'T go back into (7,6). Their one-step options: UP\u2192(8,7), RIGHT\u2192(9,6), DOWN\u2192(8,5).\n- Score: we 3 vs them 6 \u2014 they lead. NO mutual kill unless we can beat them on apples. So avoid head-on trades for now.\n\nConsider each direction\n- UP \u2192 (6,9): there\u2019s an apple at (6,9). We\u2019d eat +1 (nice), but we\u2019d be pinned to the top row next turn with only LEFT or RIGHT as options. That reduces our maneuverability \u2014 safe this turn, but tightens future squeeze. \ud83c\udf4e\u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7): legal and keeps us central. Good mobility and still able to threaten from above. No immediate clash possible this turn. \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8): ILLEGAL (neck). Instant death. NOPE. \ud83d\udeab\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8): legal, aggressive, moves us directly above the enemy\u2019s columns (x=7/8). Keeps multiple exits and starts the vertical pressure. Opponent CAN\u2019T immediately head-on us from (8,6) this turn, so this is safe and sets up a squeeze. \ud83d\udd25\n\nRisk/reward read\n- We\u2019re behind on apples \u2014 don\u2019t trade mutually unless we can surpass them. So no intentional head-on.\n- Eating the apple up-top is tempting, but being stuck on the top row reduces our ability to box. We want to approach and compress their escape lanes while keeping options. Be aggressive but not suicidal.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns)\n- Move RIGHT now to (7,8) to position above their column. From there, pivot DOWN to (7,7) to pressure their escape to the upper board. Force them toward their own body/wall. Only go for apples if it doesn\u2019t open a safe path for them or risk a head-on while they still lead in score. Stay flexible \u2014 keep 2+ follow-up moves available when possible. \ud83d\ude08\n\nFinal move \u2014 let\u2019s get closer and start the squeeze, chat LOUDER!! RIGHT",

Neck: (8,6) \u2192 they CANNOT go UP into (8,6) (that\u2019s backwards). Their plausible moves this turn: RIGHT\u2192(9,5) or DOWN\u2192(8,4). They can\u2019t immediately threaten our head. \ud83d\udccc\n- Score: we 3 vs them 6 \u2014 we\u2019re behind. No suicide head-on trades. Win by smart pressure + selective growth.\n\nConsider all directions\n- UP \u2192 (7,9): legal, keeps distance, but moves us to the top edge (less lateral room). Safe but passive. \ud83d\udfe6\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,7): legal, central, good for future pressure. But (7,6) (one step below) is part of enemy body right now so that route could be blocked next turn unless they vacate. Still a solid approach move. \ud83d\udd25\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,8): ILLEGAL (neck). NO. \ud83d\udc80\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,8): legal & there's an apple at (8,8). Eating gives +1 apple (we go to 4), we keep solid options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) \u2014 note LEFT becomes illegal next turn (back to neck) but that\u2019s fine. Opponent CAN\u2019T reach (8,8) this turn. Good value play. \ud83c\udf4e\u2694\ufe0f\n\nRisk assessment & choice\n- We\u2019re behind on apples \u2014 grabbing easy apples when safe is high-value. We must avoid mutual kills. RIGHT to (8,8) gets an apple, is safe this turn, and keeps multiple exits (up, down, right) so we won\u2019t be trapped immediately. DOWN is tempting to pressure, but it doesn\u2019t net immediate growth and risks getting hemmed if the opponent slithers right/down.\n- Opponent\u2019s moves (likely RIGHT or DOWN) won\u2019t create a head-on threat to (8,8) this turn. So we can safely snag content and stay in the fight.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns)\n- Eat (8,8) now to close gap a bit. From there, pivot DOWN to (8,7) or RIGHT to (9,8) while keeping an eye on their escape to the right. Force them toward the wall and their own body. Avoid any head-on until we can overtake them in apples or isolate them into a box with our body + walls.\n\nFinal move \u2014 get that apple, keep options, and keep the pressure.

Next turn, prioritize DOWN to eat (9,7) and grow +1 apple. After that, pivot to use the right wall and our body to pressure them leftward \u2014 force them toward their own body or into a choke. Avoid head-on unless we surpass them in apples. Stay alive, grab apples, then box.\n\nFinal call \u2014 we go claim that right-side apple, keep options open, and start corralling.

Neck: (8,8) \u2192 LEFT is illegal (would bite neck). RIGHT is off-board. Legal moves: UP -> (9,9) or DOWN -> (9,7).\n- Opponent head: (8,3). Neck: (8,4) \u2192 they CANNOT go UP into (8,4). Their only options: LEFT (7,3), RIGHT (9,3), or DOWN (8,2). They are far below \u2014 no immediate threat to our head.\n\nEvaluate moves\n- UP to (9,9): safe but gives very limited follow-ups (after moving there, DOWN would be into our neck next turn, leaving only LEFT (8,9)). No apple gain.\n- DOWN to (9,7): contains an apple (instant +1, grow). Safe this turn \u2014 opponent cannot contest that cell this move. After eating we\u2019ll have two reasonable exits next turn (LEFT to 8,7 or DOWN to 9,6), so more flexibility and board control.\n\nRisk check\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (4 vs 6) \u2014 avoid risky head-on trades. Eating and growing is the right priority to close the gap and get leverage.\n- No enemy head can reach (9,7) this turn, and no one occupies it, so it\u2019s a clean grab with minimal risk.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns)\n- Eat at (9,7) now to shrink the apple gap and extend length for corralling.\n- Next turn, use the right wall to pressure leftwards: either drop down the wall (9,6 \u2192 9,5...) to shepherd them, or pivot LEFT at 8,y to start corralling their movement into their own body. Avoid head-on unless we surpass them in apples.\n\nFinal call \u2014 go get that apple and start corralling. LET\u2019S GO!! \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

We can\u2019t throw the game on stream.  \n- Keeps options to pressure the enemy along x=8 later \u2014 we can ride the right wall and chase apples at (9,2) to close the gap.  \n- We\u2019re behind on apples (6 vs 8), so we should avoid risky immediate head-ons until we\u2019re longer. DOWN lets us grow safely and maintain mobility.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 written for the replay):\n- Move to (9,3) now. Next, push for (9,2) apple to gain length quickly.\n- Once longer, patrol the right column and compress the space around x=8, forcing them into tighter vertical fights.\n- Only force a head-on when we have an apples/length advantage. Otherwise keep them corralled and cut exits.\n\nLet\u2019s box him in, chat \u2014 bring the energy. \u2702\ufe0f\u2694\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4f\n\nDOWN",

Grabbing (8,0) ties apples and grows us \u2014 that gives us more board control along the bottom edge. We MUST avoid any head-to-head while we\u2019re not strictly leading; if the rival overcommits into tight lanes, we\u2019ll pounce, but don\u2019t initiate a trade while tied or behind.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Take (8,0) now. Then patrol the bottom row, sweeping left to contest apples at (4,0), (3,0), (1,0) when safe.\n- Keep my body hugging the right/bottom walls to force the opponent into narrower approaches. If they push up into x=7\u20138 and get cramped, start boxing them and only force head-on when we have the apple lead.\n- Stay aware of their head path from (6,5); if they swing down the 6\u20137 column we prepare to cut them off or bait them into our wall.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that apple and keep pressure.

Force them to navigate the middle where their mobility is limited. Can we start compressing their space? Yes \u2014 by sweeping left along the bottom and then curling up when the timing\u2019s right.\n- We\u2019re tied 9\u20139 \u2014 don\u2019t initiate a head-on. Let them overcommit into our walls or narrow lanes; if they do, we shove and force collisions when we have the apple lead.\n- Priority: maintain multiple escape options after each move. After LEFT, look to patrol toward (4,0)/(3,0)/(1,0) apples when safe, but only if it doesn\u2019t cut off an exit route.\n\nShort quick checks: Opponent head (6,6) can\u2019t reach our next cell this turn; UP is death now; LEFT preserves life and options.

If they commit downward and create a head-on, avoid trading since we\u2019re tied. Use bottom corridor to pick safe apples and then cut back up when we can isolate them.\n\nLEFT",

Instant death. NOPE. \ud83d\udc80\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,1): legal and open. Pulls us toward the left-side apples but is a bit passive and can slow our pressure.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,1): legal and open. Moves toward center, but edges us closer to our own bottom-row spine and that tall column at x=9.\n- UP \u2192 (3,2): legal, keeps multiple exits, and opens a fast route to the nearby apple at (2,2) and the mid-board cluster (2,2),(3,4),(3,5),(2,4). Best for aggressive control and growth.\n\nRisk check: Opponent is high-right (7,9) and likely to farm top apples; they\u2019re not an immediate head-on threat. We have the lead \u2014 growing and seizing the mid cluster increases our dominance and makes it easier to cut them off later. UP keeps the most options (can go left to eat (2,2) next turn or push further into the cluster) while avoiding tight entrapment against our own body.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP to (3,2) now to approach the cluster.\n- Then take (2,2) apple and keep sweeping the 2\u20133 x-columns (2..4) up toward y=4\u20135, growing to control mid-board corridors.\n- Maintain escape routes (don\u2019t hug our own bottom spine). If the opponent commits downward toward us later, be willing to force a head-on \u2014 we\u2019re up 12\u201310 and can win trades.\n\nUP",

Body sits behind us \u2014 don\u2019t reverse into (1,3). Opponent head at (3,8), neck at (4,8) \u2014 they can\u2019t go RIGHT this turn. They\u2019re high-up; not an immediate head-on threat.\n\nEvaluate all four moves from (1,4):\n- UP \u2192 (1,5): apple. Safe (no snake occupies it). Keeps the 1-column apple chain (1,5) \u2192 (1,6) available. Good growth now = more leverage for a future head-on. After moving here we still have multiple exits (UP or RIGHT or LEFT, neck is DOWN). \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3): our neck (backwards) \u2014 instant death. NEVER. \ud83d\udc80\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4): empty but hugs the wall. Safe this turn but reduces escape options and makes us easier to box later. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4): apple and a center entry. Also safe and attractive \u2014 gives flexible routing into the middle. Good option if we wanted immediate central control. \u2696\ufe0f\n\nWhy UP? Two big reasons:\n1) Immediate growth \u2014 the (1,5)/(1,6) chain is reachable and growing now makes us longer, which is exactly what we want while we\u2019re ahead. Bigger body = bigger threat in head-on confrontations. \ud83d\ude08\n2) Keeps options open for the next turns: from (1,5) we can follow to (1,6) or pivot right into the central corridor. We avoid hugging x=0 for more than a turn, but we can grab two quick apples first to bulk up. Opponent is far enough up top that they can\u2019t force a deadly head-on this turn, so we can safely take the apple and ramp size.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few moves):\n- Take (1,5) now (UP), then (1,6) next turn to maximize growth.  \n- After bulking, pivot RIGHT into the center (via 2,x) to start boxing the opponent and forcing a head-on while we have the length advantage.  \n- Avoid lingering on x=0; keep central escape routes open and bait them into a collision when we\u2019re longer. Let\u2019s be aggressive but never move into our own neck.\n\nAlright hype crew \u2014 let\u2019s eat another apple and get BIGGER. UP",

Neck is (1,4) \u2014 DOWN is death. DON\u2019T REVERSE. \ud83d\udc80\n- Opponent head: (3,7) with neck (3,8) \u2014 they cannot go UP this turn. They can go LEFT to (2,7) (apple), RIGHT to (4,7), or DOWN to (3,6).\n- Nearby apples: (1,6) UP, (0,5) LEFT, (2,4)/(3,5) are more central options. LEFT hugs the wall; RIGHT moves toward the center.\n\nEvaluate moves:\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,4): immediate death into our neck. ELIMINATE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,5): apple, but hard-edges and fewer escape routes \u2014 gives opponent easier opportunities to box us. Risky long-term. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,5): opens center and threatens apples at (3,5), aggressive and viable. Still good, but fewer immediate growth points this exact turn than UP.\n- UP \u2192 (1,6): apple, grows us now, keeps multiple exits (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) from the new head, and preserves flexibility to pivot into center next turn. Growing while ahead gives us leverage for a potential head-on. \u2705\u2705\n\nDecision logic: We prefer immediate growth while keeping multiple safe follow-ups open. UP picks up (1,6), increases our length (more leverage in a head-to-head), and still allows a pivot to the center after bulking up. Opponent could go LEFT to (2,7) to contest the center, but grabbing this apple now strengthens our ability to box them later. We have the apple advantage \u2014 if we can force a head-on while longer, we win. Let\u2019s not get trapped on x=0 by taking LEFT.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take (1,6) now (UP) to grow.\n- Next turn consider grabbing (1,7) or pivot RIGHT into the 2/x column to pressure the opponent toward the upper wall and set up a forced head-on (we have the +1 apple edge).\n- Avoid hugging the 0-column; keep lateral escape routes open and bait them into a collision when we\u2019re longer.\n\nTime to eat and get POWERFUL.

RIGHT is viable but more likely to invite instant mutual risk and leaves fewer good pivots. UP keeps our options open, directly contests the tile (1,7) that they can choose (which pressures them) and preserves multiple follow-ups (0,7 / 1,8 / 2,7 once vacated).\n- UP also keeps us in striking distance to close the angle on them over the next 1\u20132 turns without boxing ourselves against x=0.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP to (1,7) now to reduce their safe choices and bait them toward the top or down into risky moves.\n- If they go LEFT into our head, HEAD-ON = win (we\u2019re +1 apple). If they go UP to (2,8) or DOWN to (2,6), pivot to close their escape: favor moves that keep at least 2 follow-ups and steer them toward the upper wall where we can cut-off and force collisions.\n- Avoid hugging x=0; keep lateral mobility and use our length to control corridors.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s pressure the rival and force a mistake \u2014 UP\n\nUP",
