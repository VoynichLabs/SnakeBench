From our current position, moving RIGHT also leaves us with very limited follow-ups (only UP/RIGHT).\n\nSafer plan: commit to the uncontested bottom-row apple at (3,0). From (5,0) we\u2019re forced LEFT anyway, and the enemy is too far to meaningfully contest it, keeping us alive and scoring without head-on risk.
