This is safe and avoids the enemy, who is concentrated on the bottom-right. This path could lead to the top apples.\n   - **DOWN (2, 1):** Moves toward the apple at (2, 0). The enemy is at (4, 0), so moving down could risk a head-on collision if the enemy moves left. However, the enemy's body is blocking (5, 0) and (6, 0), so they may not move left immediately. Still, this is riskier than UP or LEFT.\n   - **LEFT (1, 2):** Moves toward the apples at (0, 2) or (0, 5). This is safe and avoids the enemy. It also keeps the snake in the left-center, maintaining flexibility.\n\n4) **Prioritize:**\n   - **Apple proximity:** The apples at (0, 2) and (0, 5) are reachable by moving LEFT. The apple at (2, 9) is reachable by moving UP. Both are viable, but moving LEFT is closer to the apples at (0, 2) and (0, 5).\n   - **Enemy snake:** The enemy's head is at (4, 0), and their body is blocking the right side. Moving LEFT or UP avoids the enemy entirely.\n   - **Long-term plan:** Moving LEFT to (1, 2) is the safest option, as it avoids the enemy and moves toward the apples at (0, 2) or (0, 5). Moving UP is also safe but slightly less direct for the nearest apples.\n\n5) **Risk Assessment:**\n   - Moving LEFT is the safest option, as it avoids the enemy and moves toward the nearest apples. It also maintains flexibility for future moves.\n   - Moving UP is also safe but slightly less optimal for the nearest apples.\n   - Moving DOWN is riskier due to the enemy's proximity.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove LEFT to (1, 2) to head toward the apples at (0, 2) or (0, 5). Avoid the enemy's vicinity and maintain flexibility by staying left-center. After collecting an apple, reassess the board for the next closest apple.\n\nLEFT",

This is the highest priority, as it increases the score and length.\n   - **Enemy avoidance:** The enemy is still on the bottom-right, and moving UP keeps the snake away from the enemy's current position and likely future moves.\n   - **Long-term plan:** Continue moving UP to (0, 5) to collect the apple, then reassess the board to move toward other apples (e.g., (2, 9)) while avoiding the enemy.

Moving DOWN keeps me on the edge and away from their likely path.\n     - The enemy may move LEFT toward (5, 2) or UP toward (6, 3), but this is unlikely to cause a collision with me.\n     - Risk: The enemy could move RIGHT to (7, 2) or (8, 2), but this is not an immediate threat to me.\n   - **Assessing LEFT (8, 1):**\n     - Moves me toward the center, closer to the enemy's body at (7, 2) and (7, 3).\n     - The enemy's head is at (6, 2), and they could move RIGHT to (7, 2) or (8, 2), which could lead to a head-on collision if I move LEFT.\n     - The apple at (9, 0) is directly below me, so moving DOWN is the most efficient way to collect it.\n\n4) **Risk Assessment:**\n   - Moving LEFT to (8, 1) is riskier due to proximity to the enemy's head and body. The enemy could move RIGHT to (7, 2) or (8, 2), increasing the chance of a head-on collision.\n   - Moving DOWN to (9, 0) is safer and more rewarding, as it collects an apple and keeps me on the edge of the board, away from the enemy's likely path.\n   - The enemy is likely to prioritize the apples at (5, 2) or (7, 0), so moving DOWN is a safer long-term strategy.\n\n5) **Long-term Plan:**\n   - Move DOWN to (9, 0) this turn to collect the apple and grow my snake.\n   - Next turn, reassess the enemy's position. If they move toward the center or left, continue moving along the bottom edge to collect the apple at (7, 0) or (1, 0).\n   - Avoid moving LEFT unless the enemy moves away from the center, as this increases collision risk.\n   - Prioritize staying on the edges to minimize collision risks and avoid the enemy's likely path.\n\nDOWN",

If they are still clustered around the center, continue moving LEFT toward (1, 0) or (0, 2).\n   - Avoid moving UP unless necessary, as it could trap me against my own body or the enemy's path.\n   - Prioritize staying on the edges to minimize collision risks and maximize apple collection.\n\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT toward (2, 0) is safe, but the enemy's head is adjacent at (1, 0). If the enemy moves LEFT to (0, 0), we could have a head-on collision if I also move LEFT to (2, 0) and then (1, 0) next turn.\n     - The enemy's head is currently at (1, 0), and they may move UP to (1, 1) or LEFT to (0, 0). If they move LEFT, I should avoid moving LEFT to (2, 0) to prevent a head-on collision next turn.\n   - **UP (3, 1):**\n     - Moves me upward, toward the enemy's body at (3, 1) and (3, 2). The enemy's head is at (1, 0), and they may move UP to (1, 1). If they move UP, their body at (3, 1) is already occupied, so this move is safe for now.\n     - Moving UP avoids the immediate risk of a head-on collision with the enemy's head if they move LEFT.\n     - This move also keeps me away from the bottom edge, where the enemy is currently concentrated, and opens up future moves toward the apple at (4, 7).\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   - UP is the best move because it avoids the immediate risk of a head-on collision with the enemy's head if they move LEFT. It also keeps me away from the enemy's dense body and opens up future moves toward the apple at (4, 7).\n   - LEFT is risky due to the enemy's head position and potential movement.\n\n5) **Long-term Plan:**\n   - Avoid moving LEFT toward the enemy's head to prevent head-on collisions.\n   - Continue moving UP to reach the apple at (4, 7) or other apples in the upper half of the board.\n   - Prioritize staying away from the enemy's dense body and maintaining flexibility for future moves.\n\nUP",
