This puts me on a path to collect an apple in just one more turn. Very promising.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (0, 2), moving away from most apples. This seems less optimal.\n\n3. **RIGHT** - Moves to (1, 3), moving toward the center. This could eventually reach (3, 4) or (5, 4), but it's longer than the UP path.\n\n**Strategic Reasoning:**\nThe apple at (0, 5) is extremely accessible - just one move UP gets me to (0, 4), and another UP gets me to (0, 5) where I can collect it. This is the shortest path to gaining my first apple. Once I have an apple and grow, I'll have a body segment, but since the apple is on my left edge path (x=0), I won't trap myself.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (0, 5), I can continue UP to reach (0, 9) which also has an apple. This creates a nice vertical chain of apples I can harvest.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. Move UP to (0, 4)\n2. Move UP to (0, 5) - collect apple #1\n3. Continue UP toward (0, 9) apple\n4. Maintain awareness of enemy snake #1's position and avoid collision\n\nUP",

From (6, 8), I could go RIGHT to (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8).\n\nBoth moves are safe. RIGHT keeps me on the top edge and gets me closer to (9, 8) directly. From (7, 9), next turn I can move RIGHT to (8, 9), then (9, 9), then DOWN to (9, 8).\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT continues my planned path along y=9 toward the (9, 8) apple. This is the most direct and keeps me away from the enemy snake which is moving in the (7, 7) area.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Continue RIGHT along y=9: (7, 9) \u2192 (8, 9) \u2192 (9, 9)\n- Then DOWN to (9, 8) to collect the apple and reach 3 points\n- Watch enemy snake movements closely\n- After (9, 8), evaluate pursuing (8, 2) or other apples\n- Stay on the edges to maintain maneuverability and avoid traps\n\nRIGHT",

All four moves appear to be fatal. Let me reconsider the board state and positions more carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the board again:\n- Row 9: `. . . . . . . . T T 0` means position (9,9) has my head (0), and (8,9) has enemy snake body (T)\n- Row 8: `. . . . . . . . . T 1` means position (9,8) has enemy head (1), and (8,8) has a T\n\nWait, let me recount the columns. The board shows x=0 to x=9 from left to right.\nRow 9 from left to right: positions (0,9) through (9,9)\nThe rightmost position is (9,9) which shows \"0\" (my head).\nThe second from right is (8,9) which shows \"T\" (enemy body).\n\nSo my body at (8,9) and (7,9) means:\n- (9,9) = my head\n- (8,9) = my body\n- (7,9) = my body\n\nEnemy snake #1:\n- (9,8) = head\n- (8,8) = body\n- (8,7) = body\n- (7,7) = body\n- (7,6) = body\n- (6,6) = body\n\nFrom (9,9):\n- UP: (9,10) = out of bounds \u2717\n- DOWN: (9,8) = enemy head (collision) \u2717\n- LEFT: (8,9) = my own body \u2717\n- RIGHT: (10,9) = out of bounds \u2717\n\nAll moves are fatal. This is a losing position. However, let me think about which death is most \"acceptable\" or if I've miscalculated.\n\nActually, checking the rules again: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\" If enemy head is at (9,8) and I move to (9,8), we collide and both die. But I have 2 apples and enemy has 5, so I lose.\n\nGiven that all moves are fatal, I must choose the move that's unavoidable. DOWN (head-on collision with enemy) at least eliminates the opponent from scoring further, though we both lose. This is the least bad option strategically, though it doesn't change the outcome for me.\n\nActually, wait - if both snakes die on the same turn, the one with more apples wins (enemy has 5, I have 2). So I'm already losing.\n\nSince all moves are fatal anyway, I'll choose DOWN for the head-on collision.\n\nDOWN",

However, from (9,9) there would be no legal next move (up/right are off\u2011board, left runs into the enemy\u2019s body, and down would step back onto our own new body segment), leaving us trapped.  \n- Moving DOWN keeps the head on (9,7), a currently empty square that is not part of our own body. From there we still have at least one safe direction (further DOWN) and can continue to explore the board while staying away from collisions.  \n\nThis move preserves future options and avoids the dead\u2011end that moving UP would create.  \n\nDOWN",
