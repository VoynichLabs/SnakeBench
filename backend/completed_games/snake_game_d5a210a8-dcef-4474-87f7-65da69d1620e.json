We're LIVE and ready to box in Snake #1! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLet's analyze the board state:\n- Our head: (8, 1)\n- Enemy head: (7, 0)\n- We're both length 1 (no body)\n- Apples scattered everywhere but we don't care - we care about CRUSHING the enemy!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is at (7,0) and could potentially move into (8,0) or (7,1) or (6,0) or stay in place. If they go UP to (7,1) while we go DOWN to (8,0), we'd be adjacent. If they go RIGHT to (8,0) while we go DOWN to (8,0) - HEAD ON COLLISION! That's a double KO if we're both length 1, but since we're both 0 apples, that's a DRAW. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. We want to WIN.\n\n**OUR MOVES CONSIDERED:**\n1. **LEFT to (7,1)**: Could lead to head-on with enemy if they go RIGHT to (8,0)? No, (8,0) vs (7,1) - not same cell. But we'd be closer to them. If they go UP to (7,1) - HEAD ON! Both die. Risky.\n2. **RIGHT to (9,1)**: Safe move! Board edge but still valid. No immediate collision. Opens up future moves. We'd be at (9,1).\n3. **UP to (8,2)**: Also safe! Moves us away from enemy. Opens up top area.\n4. **DOWN to (8,0)**: Could lead to head-on if enemy goes RIGHT to (8,0)! Both die. Too risky.\n\n**STRATEGY:** We want to AVOID head-on collisions since we're both 0 apples - that's a draw. We want to survive and outmaneuver. Moving RIGHT to (9,1) or UP to (8,2) both give us space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move to (9,1) to get along the right wall, then we can try to circle around and trap the enemy against the left side. We need to force them into a position where they have fewer escape routes than us. With 10x10 board, we can use the walls to our advantage.\n\nI'm going RIGHT to (9,1) - gives us wall safety and opens up upward movement next turn. We'll play it safe for now and then close the trap!\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s think this through like the ruthless serpent we are. \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d\n\nQuick status check:\n- Our head: (7,0)  \n- Enemy head: (8,1)  \n- Both have no body segments yet. Scores tied 0-0. Apples matter, but enemy control matters more. Ready to be aggressive but not suicidal. \ud83d\udc80\n\nDecision process (thinking out loud for the chat \u2014 you know they love it):\n1) Consider all moves:\n- UP -> (7,1). This is legal, but the opponent at (8,1) can move LEFT into (7,1). If they do, we both collide head-on and both die. With tied score, we avoid an unnecessary mutual KO. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN -> (7,-1). Off the board. Instant death. NOPE. \ud83d\udeab\n- LEFT -> (6,0). Apple at (6,0)! Safe this turn \u2014 opponent can\u2019t reach that cell in one move. We pick up an apple, grow, and take the lead. That gives us leverage to force clashes later. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n- RIGHT -> (8,0). This sits directly under the enemy head. If they go DOWN to (8,0) we BOTH die (head-on). Too risky when scores are tied. \ud83d\udeb7\n\n2) Eliminate unsafe moves: DOWN is offboard. RIGHT and UP have high head-on risk because enemy can move into the same target cells. We don\u2019t want a tied suicide.\n\n3) Best remaining move: LEFT to (6,0). It\u2019s a safe apple grab, grows us to take the score lead, and increases our ability to dictate fights later. Aggression with advantage > foolish aggression tied score. \ud83d\udc51\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns (so future-me/chat can follow-up): \n- Grab this apple now (LEFT) and use the extra segment to posture aggressively along the bottom row. \n- Aim to control the lower-right quadrant, forcing the opponent up or into the wall. \n- Once we have the lead, try to bait a head-on when he\u2019s cornered or has fewer escape cells. Prioritize limiting his escape options and only force head-ons when we\u2019re ahead. \ud83d\udcc8\ud83e\udde0\n\nWe go take that apple and set the trap. LET\u2019S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

Turn 2 and we're still LIVING! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet's break down the new board state after our first move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (9, 1) - I'm on the right edge now, cozy against the wall\n- Enemy head: (6, 0) - They moved RIGHT from (7,0) to (6,0)? Wait, that doesn't match the board... Let me check...\n- Looking at the board: Enemy is at (6,0) with body at (7,0) - so they moved LEFT from (7,0) to (6,0)? Actually looking at the board state, I see \"1 T\" at (7,0) and \"1\" at (6,0) - so yes, enemy is at (6,0) with tail at (7,0)\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nEnemy is now at (6,0) and has grown! They're length 2 now (head at 6,0, tail at 7,0). I'm still length 1. This is getting dangerous - they're ahead in apples and size.\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS FROM (9,1):**\n1. **LEFT to (8,1)**: Safe, moves back toward center. Opens up options.\n2. **UP to (9,2)**: Safe, moves along wall. Could trap me later if I keep going up.\n3. **DOWN to (9,0)**: Check board - there's an apple at (9,0)! Also no body there. Safe and gets me an apple to grow! This is CONTENT!\n4. **RIGHT**: Off board! DEAD! Can't do that.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nThe enemy has a length advantage and is heading left. I need to GROW to compete. The apple at (9,0) is RIGHT THERE. Moving DOWN gives me an apple, grows me to length 2, and keeps me safe against the wall. This is smart growth - I'm not focusing on the apple itself, but using it to increase my threat level against the enemy.\n\nPlus, being at (9,0) with length 2 means I'll have a tail at (9,1), which blocks that cell. If the enemy tries to come toward me, they'll have to deal with my growing body.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get the apple at (9,0), grow to length 2. Then I can start moving left and up, using my growing body to create barriers. I need to match the enemy's length ASAP so I can start forcing head-on collisions on MY terms.\n\nDOWN\nEND",

Turn 2 and we're still LIVING! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet's break down the new board state after our first move RIGHT to (9,1):\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (9, 1) - I'm on the right edge now, cozy against the wall\n- Enemy head: (6, 1) - They moved UP from (6,0) to (6,1)? Wait, that doesn't match the board... Let me check...\n- Looking at the board: Enemy is at (6,1) with body at (6,0) - so they moved UP from (6,0) to (6,1)? Actually looking at the board state, I see \"1 T\" at (6,0) and \"1\" at (6,1) - so yes, enemy is at (6,1) with tail at (6,0)\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nEnemy is now at (6,1) and has grown! They're length 2 now (head at 6,1, tail at 6,0). I'm still length 1. This is getting dangerous - they're ahead in apples and size.\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS FROM (9,1):**\n1. **LEFT to (8,1)**: Safe, moves back toward center. Opens up options.\n2. **UP to (9,2)**: Safe, moves along wall. There's an apple at (6,2) but that's far. Could trap me later if I keep going up.\n3. **DOWN to (9,0)**: Check board - there's an apple at (9,0)! Also no body there. Safe and gets me an apple to grow! This is CONTENT!\n4. **RIGHT**: Off board! DEAD! Can't do that.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nThe enemy has a length advantage and is heading left. I need to GROW to compete. The apple at (9,0) is RIGHT THERE. Moving DOWN gives me an apple, grows me to length 2, and keeps me safe against the wall. This is smart growth - I'm not focusing on the apple itself, but using it to increase my threat level against the enemy.\n\nPlus, being at (9,0) with length 2 means I'll have a tail at (9,1), which blocks that cell. If the enemy tries to come toward me, they'll have to deal with my growing body.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get the apple at (9,0), grow to length 2. Then I can start moving left and up, using my growing body to create barriers. I need to match the enemy's length ASAP so I can start forcing head-on collisions on MY terms.\n\nDOWN",

Body: (6,0).\n- Opponent head: (9,0) with body at (9,1). They basically have only one legal move: LEFT to (8,0) (UP is into their body, RIGHT/DOWN are offboard).\n- Apples: there\u2019s an apple at (6,2) right above us.\n\nMove options:\n- UP -> (6,2): safe, contains an apple. Grabs the apple so we go up to 2 apples \u2014 sweet lead. Opponent cannot threaten a head-on this turn. Best play.\n- DOWN -> (6,0): illegal (backwards into our body). Auto NO.\n- LEFT -> (5,1): legal but skips an easy apple and keeps us nearer to edges later. Less value this turn.\n- RIGHT -> (7,1): legal but also passes up the apple and gives the opponent more room to wiggle.\n\nRationale: Take the apple now. Growing to 2 apples strengthens our ability to force a head-on later (we prefer forcing it when we lead). UP keeps our mobility high and doesn\u2019t walk into any trap \u2014 opponent is forced left and can\u2019t threaten us this turn. Tight, aggressive, high-value play.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns: eat the apple, then pivot to cut off the opponent\u2019s escape to the left side of the board. Use our extra length to box him toward the right wall and force a head-on when his escape cells are limited. Stay aggressive but avoid getting squeezed along the edges ourselves.\n\nUP",
