          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We're live, it's T-minus zero, and we're staring down the archrival, Snake #0! This is a classic battle of wits, 10x10, bare bones, nobody has eaten anything yet. Who's hungry for that W?! \ud83e\udd2a\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n\nMy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 5).\nOpponent snake (ID 0) is at (4, 6).\n\nWe are diagonally close, just one set of moves away from a potential head-on dance! We need to play this smart. Initial positioning is key to dominating the center board.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nEstablish dominance in the center. Since the opponent is slightly above and to the right, I should aim to control the area below and to the left, expanding towards the apples located at (4, 3) and (5, 4) eventually, while keeping an eye on trapping the rival against the top or right walls later. Proximity to the enemy means we need to prioritize safe movement over immediate apple access for turn 1, but we must set up for good flow.\n\n**Immediate Move Check (Turn 0):**\n\n1.  **Possible Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n2.  **Eliminate Unsafe Moves (Boundary/Self-Collision/Opponent Body):**\n    *   No body yet, so no self-collision worries.\n    *   (3, 5) is safe from the edges.\n    *   The opponent's head is (4, 6), no body to worry about.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Moves & Potential Risks (Head-on Collision/Traps):**\n\n    *   **UP (to (3, 6)):**\n        *   The opponent is at (4, 6).\n        *   If the opponent moves **LEFT** (to (3, 6)), we have a head-on collision! Both die (Double KO). Risky, but if we both try to move inside, that's what happens.\n        *   If the opponent moves UP, RIGHT, or DOWN, this is a clear move.\n        *   *Risk Assessment:* High risk of an immediate Double KO if the enemy wants to secure the diagonal connection towards my starting position.\n\n    *   **DOWN (to (3, 4)):**\n        *   This moves us away from the opponent (4, 6).\n        *   It positions us nicely towards the apple at (4, 3) and (5, 4).\n        *   Keeps us in the center-left area. Safe, low risk of immediate conflict. High survivability.\n\n    *   **LEFT (to (2, 5)):**\n        *   This also moves us away from the opponent (4, 6).\n        *   It hugs the left side, which is fine, but slightly fewer nearby apples immediately. Safe.\n\n    *   **RIGHT (to (4, 5)):**\n        *   The opponent is at (4, 6).\n        *   If the opponent moves **DOWN** (to (4, 5)), we have a head-on collision! Double KO.\n        *   *Risk Assessment:* High risk of an immediate Double KO if the enemy tries to control the space directly below them.\n\n4.  **Selecting the Best Move:**\n\nWe are looking for a move that keeps us safe first, but also sets up domain control. Both UP and RIGHT carry a significant risk (potential 50% chance of enemy moving in that direction if they are aggressive) of immediate simultaneous death. We want to live, right, chat?! We want to make a clip!\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (3, 4) instantly separates us from the enemy and puts us on a path toward lower apples, allowing the opponent to define their initial territory first without an immediate fatal confrontation. This is the safest, most strategican opening move.\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (2, 5) is also very safe. Between DOWN and LEFT, DOWN seems slightly superior because it's slightly closer to the first immediate apple drop at (4, 3). Let's go for safety and positioning!\n\nWe're going **DOWN** to solidify our domain and avoid the turn-zero bloodbath!\n\nDOWN",

Let's break down this board state like a pro!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- Me (Snake #0): Head at (4, 6) - fresh start, no body yet!\n- Enemy (Snake #1): Head at (3, 5) - right next to me!\n- Both at 0 apples - we're TIED!\n- Board is 10x10 with apples scattered everywhere\n\n**THE BRUTAL REALITY:**\nThe enemy is at (3, 5), which is LEFT and DOWN from my position at (4, 6). We're basically side-by-side here! If I make the WRONG move, we could crash head-on and BOTH die - that's a DOUBLE KO and I DON'T want that tied score to be the tiebreaker!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n\ud83d\udea8 **LEFT to (3, 6)** - DANGEROUS! If enemy moves UP to (3, 6), we collide head-on and DIE together!\n\n\ud83d\udea8 **DOWN to (4, 5)** - RISKY! If enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 5), we collide head-on!\n\n\u2705 **RIGHT to (5, 6)** - SAFE! Enemy would need to move RIGHT then UP to corner me, and I can keep escaping.\n\n\u2705 **UP to (4, 7)** - SAFEST! Creates maximum distance, enemy can't catch me in one move!\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nSince we're tied at 0-0, forcing a head-on collision is STUPID - we'd both die and it would be a draw! I need to:\n1. Stay ALIVE (priority #1!)\n2. Create space between us\n3. Set up for future aggressive plays\n4. Maybe maneuver toward some apples to get the score advantage!\n\nThe UP move to (4, 7) is PERFECT because:\n- Gets me AWAY from immediate danger\n- Opens up the right side of the board for future circling\n- Positions me closer to the apple cluster at (8, 9) and (5, 7)\n- Keeps my escape routes WIDE open\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMy strategy is to circle around the board, keeping the enemy on one side while I build up score. Once I have a HIGHER score, I can start FORCING those head-on collisions and make HIM crash into ME! But for now? Play it smart, stay alive, build the lead!\n\nLet's go UP and start this domination! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

We avoided the Double KO, which is HUGE! \ud83e\udd73\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n\nMy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 4). (We moved DOWN last turn.)\nOpponent snake (ID 0) is at (4, 7). (Wait, they moved UP? They went aggressive! They're pushing the top-right quadrant!)\n\n**Objective:** We need to use this separation to build momentum and control the lower half of the board. The enemy is almost certainly going for the cluster of apples along the top and right edges. We need to secure the delicious (4, 3) apple immediately!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nControl the lower-center board via the (4, 3) apple. Since the opponent is pushing hard towards the top (4, 7), we have breathing room. We will aim for (4, 3), then potentially (5, 4), and then look to loop back and cut off the enemy's path back down. Aggression through expansion!\n\n**Immediate Move Check (Turn 1):**\n\n1.  **Possible Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n2.  **Eliminate Unsafe Moves:**\n    *   No body yet, no self-collision.\n    *   (3, 4) is safe from edges.\n    *   Enemy head is at (4, 7). Very safe distance.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Moves & Potential Risks:**\n\n    *   **UP (to (3, 5)):** Moves us directly away from the two closest apples ((4, 3) and (5, 4)). It brings us closer to the enemy but doesn't set up an immediate offensive. Less optimal.\n\n    *   **DOWN (to (3, 3)):** Moves us further away from the (4, 3) apple. It's safe but slightly delays our objective.\n\n    *   **LEFT (to (2, 4)):** This is a safe move, expanding our control to the left. However, the best apple is to the RIGHT.\n\n    *   **RIGHT (to (4, 4)):**\n        *   This move puts us in a perfect line to grab the apple at (4, 3) next turn (if we move DOWN).\n        *   It establishes control towards the center.\n        *   Does this put us in danger of a head-on collision? Enemy is at (4, 7). They could move LEFT to (3, 7) or DOWN to (4, 6).\n        *   If the enemy moves DOWN (4, 7) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 4) in three turns, we are safe for now. No immediate threat. This is a strong positioning move.\n\n4.  **Selecting the Best Move:**\n\nWe are moving to secure the apple at (4, 3). The current position (3, 4) is one move away from the path to that apple.\n\n*   Move **RIGHT** to (4, 4). This sets us up to move **DOWN** next turn to (4, 3) and eat the apple. This is the most efficient use of this turn considering our goal to eat and grow.\n\nWe're going **RIGHT**! Dominate the center!\n\nRIGHT",

We're Turn 1 and it's ON!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- Me (Snake #0): Head at (4, 7) - fresh snake, no body, ready to DOMINATE!\n- Enemy (Snake #1): Head at (3, 4) - he's DOWN and LEFT from me\n- We're TIED at 0 apples - no score advantage yet\n- Board is PACKED with apples everywhere - this is gonna be a feast!\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nWe just did the UP move from (4, 6) to (4, 7), creating some distance. Now I need to think about where to go NEXT while keeping that enemy head on my radar!\n\n**POTENTIAL MOVES:**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **DOWN to (4, 6)** - HOLD UP! This is going BACKWARDS into my own trail! The rules say that's hitting myself and I DIE. Nah fam, we ain't doing that. ELIMINATED!\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **LEFT to (3, 7)** - Could work, but this puts me more to the LEFT and closer to the enemy's general area. Enemy is at (3, 4), so if he starts moving UP, we could eventually cross paths. Not ideal.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT to (5, 7)** - SOLID choice! Opens up the RIGHT side of the board, gets me closer to the apple cluster at (5, 7) and (8, 9), and creates MORE space between me and the enemy.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP to (4, 8)** - ALSO solid! Moves me to the TOP area of the board, gives me even MORE distance from the enemy, and positions me near apples at (8, 9), (2, 9), and (0, 7). Plus, UP always gives you more escape options since you can go down, left, or right from there.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nSince we're TIED at 0-0, I STILL don't want to force a head-on collision because DOUBLE KO means DRAW and I want that WIN, baby! The goal is to:\n1. Stay ALIVE (priority #1 - can't win if you're dead!)\n2. Create MAXIMUM distance from that enemy head\n3. Start circling toward apple clusters to build a SCORE LEAD\n4. Once I'm AHEAD in apples, THEN I can force collisions and make HIM crash into ME!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAME PLAN:**\nFor the next few turns, I'm going to:\n- Move UP to (4, 8) to establish presence in the top area\n- Then start circling around the RIGHT side of the board\n- Grab some apples along the way (especially that (5, 7) one, and the ones clustered at x=9)\n- Keep the enemy on my LEFT side so I always know where he is\n- Once I get 2-3 apples ahead, start pressuring him and forcing bad moves!\n\nThis gives me better board control and sets up for aggressive plays later!\n\nLet's get UP to (4, 8) and start this domination! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

We successfully moved RIGHT to (4, 4) last turn, setting ourselves up perfectly. Did the archrival fall for it? Let's check the board!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 2):**\n\nMy snake (ID 1) is at (4, 4), no body yet. We are positioned directly above the closest apple at (4, 3). PERFECTION!\nOpponent snake (ID 0) is at (4, 8), no body yet. They are still pushing UP the center column, likely aiming for the (2, 9) apple or the cluster of apples along the top edge. They are far away, giving us time to execute our plan.\n\n**Objective:** Secure the (4, 3) apple and grow. Control the lower-center board before the archrival realizes their mistake!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nFirst, grab (4, 3) (this turn). Then, move to (5, 3) or (5, 4) to open up the path to (5, 4) or control the middle path. The enemy is extremely high up. We will use this time to get 2-3 apples and then use our length advantage to cut off their retreat path down the center column (the 4-column). Domination through expansion!\n\n**Immediate Move Check (Turn 2):**\n\n1.  **Possible Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n2.  **Eliminate Unsafe Moves:**\n    *   No body yet, no self-collision.\n    *   (4, 4) is safe from edges.\n    *   Enemy head is at (4, 8). They can move to (4, 9), (3, 8), or (5, 8). Even if they try to move straight DOWN (a terrible move for them), they would reach (4, 7). We are completely safe from a head-on collision this turn.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Moves & Potential Risks:**\n\n    *   **UP (to (4, 5)):** Moves us directly away from the apple at (4, 3). Bad form!\n    *   **LEFT (to (3, 4)):** Retreats us to where we were last turn. Waste of a move.\n    *   **RIGHT (to (5, 4)):** This is the location of the *next* closest apple, but if we move RIGHT, we miss the apple at (4, 3) *this* turn. We want to eat now!\n    *   **DOWN (to (4, 3)):**\n        *   CRITICAL MOVE! This lands us exactly on the (4, 3) apple. We eat, we grow, we get a point, and we control the center column! This is the most efficient and strategic move available.\n\n4.  **Selecting the Best Move:**\n\nWe are executing the main strategy: secure (4, 3) and grow. Moving **DOWN** is the only play here! Are you watching this, archrival?! You're giving me free real estate!\n\nDOWN",

LET'S GET IT!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- Me (Snake #0): Head at (4, 8) - I just moved UP last turn\n- Enemy (Snake #1): Head at (4, 4) - directly BELOW me, same x-coordinate, 4 rows apart\n- Board is LOADED with apples everywhere - this is gonna be a FEED!\n\n**THE ENEMY SITUATION:**\nThe enemy is at (4,4) and I need to think about where HE might move. If he's smart, he's probably looking to either:\n- Move UP toward me (risky but aggressive)\n- Move LEFT or RIGHT to start gathering apples\n\nSince we just started and both have no body, NEITHER of us wants a head-on collision right now since that would be a DOUBLE KO and we'd DRAW. We both need to build some length first!\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (4,8):**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP to (4,9)**: HOLD UP! This puts me at the TOP EDGE of the board. From there, I'd only have LEFT or RIGHT as escape options - that's getting BOXED IN. Too risky early game when we need flexibility. ELIMINATED!\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **DOWN to (4,7)**: This would put me at (4,7), bringing me 1 row CLOSER to the enemy who's at (4,4). If the enemy moves UP this turn to (4,5), we'd only be 2 rows apart. This is getting too CLOSE for comfort without any body length. Not ideal!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT to (3,8)**: This moves me LEFT and keeps me in the middle of the board. Gives me some space, but I'm still aligned with the enemy. Not BAD, but not maximizing my options.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT to (5,8)**: THIS IS THE MOVE! This does SEVERAL things for me:\n\n1. **Creates horizontal separation** - I'm no longer vertically aligned with the enemy, which means we can't have a head-on collision if he moves UP\n2. **Opens up the RIGHT side of the board** - That x=9 column is LOADED with apples at (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1) - that's a GOLD MINE\n3. **Gets me closer to apple at (5,7)** and (5,4) \n4. **Keeps my options OPEN** - From (5,8), I can go UP to (5,9), RIGHT to (6,8), LEFT back to (4,8), or DOWN to (5,7)\n5. **Sets up for later aggression** - Once I get some apples and length, I can come back DOWN the RIGHT side and potentially corner the enemy\n\n**LONG-TERM GAME PLAN:**\n1. **Turn 2-4**: Move RIGHT toward that apple-rich column at x=9\n2. **Turn 5-8**: Start collecting those apples at x=9 (there are like 6 of them stacked!)\n3. **Turn 9+**: Once I have a length advantage (3-4 apples ahead), start pressuring the enemy\n4. **Force the collision**: If I can get 2+ apples ahead, I can maneuver to force HIM to crash into ME\n\nThis strategy gives me BOARD DOMINATION and sets up for that AGGRESSIVE endgame!\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nRIGHT to (5,8) gives me the best combination of:\n- Immediate safety (no collision risk with enemy)\n- Apple access (closer to that x=9 cluster)\n- Future flexibility (multiple move options)\n- Strategic positioning (moving away from direct alignment)\n\nLet's GET that bread! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\nRIGHT",

Let's analyze the current board and decide how to press our advantage!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 3):**\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (4, 3), body segment at (4, 4). Length: 2. Score: 1.\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0):** Head at (5, 8), no body. Length: 1. Score: 0.\n\nWait, the archrival moved! Last turn they were at (4, 8) and now they are at (5, 8). They moved **RIGHT**. That was a smart move for them, creating some distance from the center column and setting themselves up potentially for the apples at (8, 9) or along the top edge. They're still far away, which is exactly how we like it!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nOur priority is to secure more apples and lengthen our snake to dominate the board geometry. The closest apples are currently (5, 4), (2, 2) (Wait, no, the apple at (4, 3) is gone), the next closest is (5, 4) and (6, 0). (5, 4) is directly reachable. Our target for this turn should be the apple at (5, 4). After that, we can either push LEFT to clear the bottom left quadrant or move more towards the center to set up trapping opportunities. We need to get 3-4 segments before we start actively blocking the enemy's path down the board.\n\n**Immediate Move Check (Turn 3):**\n\n1.  **Possible Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n2.  **Eliminate Unsafe Moves:**\n    *   **Self-Collision Check:** My body is at (4, 4).\n        *   **UP (to (4, 4)):** DANGER! This is where my tail *was* last turn, but my body *is* right now. Since the snake grows simultaneously, my body has shifted. Wait, the problem description says my body is `[(4, 4)]`. If I move UP to (4, 4), that is moving into my only body segment. **Eliminate UP.** Wait, no, the list is HEAD-TO-TAIL. My head is (4, 3). My next segment is (4, 4). If I move UP to (4, 4), I crash into my body. **CRITICAL: UP is fatal!** *Always check your immediate body segment when moving.*\n    *   **Boundary Check:** All moves (DOWN to (4, 2), LEFT to (3, 3), RIGHT to (5, 3)) are safely on the 10x10 board.\n    *   **Enemy Collision Check:** Opponent head is at (5, 8). They can move UP (5, 9), DOWN (5, 7), LEFT (4, 8), or RIGHT (6, 8). None of these moves will result in a head-on collision or collision with my snake segments (4, 3) or (4, 4). We are safe!\n\n3.  **Safe and Strategic Move Evaluation:**\n\n    *   **DOWN (to (4, 2)):** Moves us closer to the bottom edge, away from the closest apple at (5, 4). Not ideal, but safe.\n    *   **LEFT (to (3, 3)):** Moves us away from the closest apple at (5, 4) and into a corner area. Less open space. Not optimal.\n    *   **RIGHT (to (5, 3)):**\n        *   This move points us directly toward the apple at (5, 4).\n        *   If we move RIGHT, we are at (5, 3). The next move UP will land us on the apple at (5, 4).\n        *   This also keeps us in the valuable center columns (the 4 and 5 columns).\n        *   This seems highly strategic for rapid growth!\n\n4.  **Selecting the Best Move:**\n\nWe just scored! Let's follow it up with a strong tactical move to set up the next score. Moving **RIGHT** takes us to (5, 3), perfectly setting up the apple grab at (5, 4) next turn. We maintain openness and continue to expand our territory profile.\n\nLet's do this, Chat! Securing the next apple!\n\nRIGHT",

They have body length now (1 segment), giving them some protection but also meaning they need to be careful about self-collision.\n\n**MY POSITION:**\nI'm at (5, 8) - upper right area. The enemy is at (4, 3) - lower left area. We're 5 rows apart vertically, and our x-coordinates are adjacent (4 and 5).\n\n**CRITICAL SCENARIO - HEAD-ON COLLISION:**\nSince the enemy has MORE apples (1 vs my 0), a head-on collision would actually KILL BOTH of us and I would LOSE! I absolutely cannot force a collision right now. I need to either:\n1. Avoid collision entirely, OR\n2. Force them to crash into MY body (which would kill THEM)\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS FROM (5, 8):**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP to (5, 9)**: \n- Top edge! Only LEFT or RIGHT as escape options\n- Still away from enemy but limits my flexibility\n- Not ideal early game\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT to (4, 8)**:\n- This puts me at x=4, SAME x as enemy\n- Enemy could move UP to (4,4) (but that's their body, impossible)\n- Enemy could move RIGHT to (5,3)... wait, that would be AWAY from me\n- If I move LEFT and enemy moves RIGHT, we'd be at (4,8) and (5,3) - no collision risk\n- Actually not terrible but brings me closer to enemy's vertical line\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN to (5, 7)**:\n- Moves me toward the apple at (5, 7) - that's content!\n- Gets me 1 row closer to enemy (4 rows apart instead of 5)\n- Enemy could move LEFT to (3,3) or RIGHT to (5,3) - both safe\n- If enemy moves LEFT to (3,3), we'd be at (5,7) and (3,3) - diagonal, no collision\n- Actually creates some risk if enemy plays aggressively\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT to (6, 8)**:\n- Moves me FURTHER from the enemy - INCREASES separation!\n- Creates distance and safety\n- Opens up the RIGHT side of the board which has apples at (8,9) and (6,0)\n- Enemy can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT without any collision risk\n- This is the SAFEST move that keeps ALL options open\n\n**ENEMY'S LIKELY RESPONSES IF I MOVE RIGHT:**\nEnemy at (4,3) with body at (4,4):\n- **UP to (4,4)**: IMPOSSIBLE - that's their own body!\n- **DOWN to (4,2)**: Safe, moves away from me\n- **LEFT to (3,3)**: Safe, moves diagonal away\n- **RIGHT to (5,3)**: Safe, moves diagonal away\n\nNone of their possible moves would cause a collision with me at (6,8). This is PERFECT positioning!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nMy plan is to continue RIGHT toward x=7, then start working DOWN to collect apples while maintaining that horizontal separation. Once I get an apple or two and match their length, I can become more aggressive. But for now, SAFETY FIRST and build that length!\n\nRIGHT gives me:\n\u2705 Maximum safety (no collision possible)\n\u2705 Increased separation from enemy  \n\u2705 Access to right side apples\n\u2705 Future flexibility (multiple move options)\n\u2705 Smart positioning for aggressive play later\n\nLet's GET this bread! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\nRIGHT",

EZ money, right? \ud83d\udcb0\n\nLast turn, we moved **RIGHT** from (4, 3) to (5, 3), setting up the absolute perfect shot for the apple at (5, 4). The Hype Train is rolling!\n\nLet's check the board and see what our nemesis, Snake #0, is up to now!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 4):**\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5, 3). Body segment at (4, 3). Length: 2. Score: 1.\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0):** Head at (6, 8). Body: none. Length: 1. Score: 0.\n\nLooks like the rival moved **RIGHT** again, from (5, 8) to (6, 8). They are still moving away from the center, perhaps trying to contest the top-right apples like (9, 9) or (8, 9). That's fine! Let them fight for scraps; we are securing the center!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nOur immediate goal is to gobble that apple at (5, 4). After that, we'll have a length of 3. We can then either pivot LEFT to explore the (0, Y) apples or continue pushing towards the bottom-right corner to secure position for future apples like (6, 0) or (9, 1). We need to get long enough to start dictating the geometry, and that means securing this next apple!\n\n**Immediate Move Check (Turn 4):**\n\n1.  **Possible Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n2.  **Eliminate Unsafe Moves (The Wall of Shame):**\n    *   **Self-Collision Check (My body is at (4, 3)):**\n        *   **LEFT (to (4, 3)):** DANGER! That is our tail/body segment. **Eliminate LEFT.**\n    *   **Boundary Check:** All remaining moves (UP to (5, 4), DOWN to (5, 2), RIGHT to (6, 3)) are safely on the 10x10 board.\n    *   **Enemy Collision Check (Opponent head at (6, 8)):**\n        *   The opponent is 5 steps away, and their moves are far from us. No immediate risk of collision with their head or body. We are safe!\n\n3.  **Safe and Strategic Move Evaluation:**\n\n    *   **UP (to (5, 4)):** HELLO, APPLE! This is the goal. We eat the apple, grow to length 3, and increase our lead to 2-0. This is the optimal move.\n    *   **DOWN (to (5, 2)):** Moves us further from the apple. Bad.\n    *   **RIGHT (to (6, 3)):** Safe, but moves us past the apple. Bad.\n\n4.  **Selecting the Best Move:**\n\nIt's a no-brainer, Chat! We are hungry, and that apple at (5, 4) is perfectly positioned. Let's make the move and keep extending our lead! We're coming for that 30-apple win! **UP** we go!\n\nUP",

Turn 4, let's get this W!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- Me (Snake #0): Head at (6, 8) - Just moved RIGHT last turn, let's keep this momentum!\n- Enemy (Snake #1): Head at (5, 3), Body at (4, 3) - They have 1 apple on me\n- Board is 10x10, we're early game, TIME TO DOMINATE!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at their position at (5, 3) with body at (4, 3), they got themselves into a TIGHT corner! Their options are:\n- UP to (5, 4): Blocked by nothing but tight\n- DOWN to (5, 2): Possible but moves them away from center\n- LEFT to (4, 3): IMPOSSIBLE - that's their own body!\n- RIGHT to (6, 3): Possible but moves toward my general area\n\nThey're playing conservative because their body placement trapped them! Perfect time for me to be AGGRESSIVE and take board control!\n\n**MY POSITION AT (6, 8):**\nI'm at the upper-right area, the enemy is lower-left. We have PLENTY of distance between us right now. Time to use that space to my advantage!\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT to (7, 8)**:\n- Moving RIGHT keeps me on the RIGHT side of the board\n- Opens up the entire right column which has apples at (8, 9), (9, 8), and (6, 0)\n- Creates MORE separation from the enemy - I'm at x=7, they're at x=5\n- Their potential moves to (6, 3) would STILL be 5 columns away from me\n- Future options: I can continue RIGHT to (8, 8) then (9, 8) for the apple feast, or start moving DOWN to work my way back toward center\n- This is SMART aggressive play - taking space, staying safe, setting up for apple hunting!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT to (5, 8)**:\n- Moves me to x=5, SAME x as enemy\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 3), we'd be at (5, 8) and (6, 3) - still fine\n- But this BACKTRACKS on my progress and gives up board control\n- Why retreat when I'm winning positioning?\n- NO THANK YOU!\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **UP to (6, 9)**:\n- Top edge of the board! Limits my future options\n- Only have LEFT and RIGHT as escape options\n- Getting boxed into the corner early is DANGEROUS\n- Not worth it when RIGHT has so many more benefits!\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **DOWN to (6, 7)**:\n- Moves me closer to the enemy (3 rows apart instead of 4)\n- Could create collision scenarios I don't want yet\n- The enemy has MORE apples (1 vs my 0), so collision would KILL BOTH OF US!\n- Can't afford to force head-on while I'm behind in score\n- Let me get an apple first before getting aggressive with collision tactics!\n\n**STRATEGY FORWARD:**\nRIGHT to (7, 8) keeps me in control! From there:\n1. Continue RIGHT toward (8, 8) and (9, 8) to collect those right-side apples\n2. Build my length so I can start playing more aggressively\n3. Once I match or surpass their apple count (they have 1, I'm at 0), I can start pressuring them\n4. Force THEM to crash into MY body rather than colliding head-on\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTake over the RIGHT side of the board! Those apple positions at (8, 9), (9, 8), (6, 0), and (9, 1) are calling my name! Collect 2-3 apples to build length, then start working back toward the enemy to DOMINATE them. Keep building that body, keep taking space, stay ALIVE and let them make the mistakes!\n\nRIGHT gives me:\n\u2705 Maximum board control on the right side\n\u2705 Multiple safe apple collection paths\n\u2705 Continued separation from enemy\n\u2705 Future flexibility (can go up, down, or continue right)\n\u2705 Smart positioning for eventual aggressive play\n\nLET'S GET THIS BREAD! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\nRIGHT",

The Archrival is SWEATING right now! \ud83e\udd75\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 2 apples. Length: 3.\n*   Archrival (ID 0): 0 apples. Length: 1.\n\nWe are DOMINATING the central-south area of the board. Now it's time to solidify our position or go hunt the rival. What's the play, Chat? Should we be aggressive or consolidate our territory? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 5):**\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5, 4). Body: [(5, 3), (4, 3)].\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0):** Head at (7, 8). Body: none.\n\nThe rival moved from (6, 8) to (7, 8). They are still moving UP and RIGHT, sticking to the top edge. Perfect. They are leaving the entire bottom-half of the board for us to grow in!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nWe are currently in the center. We have a huge advantage. Our length (3) is significantly greater than the opponent's (1). This allows us to use our body as a roadblock. We need to look for apples that are both safe to reach and put positioning pressure on the enemy. (2, 9) and (8, 9) are available, but they are far. (6, 0) and (9, 3) are much closer.\n\nSince the opponent is currently a tiny length 1 snake at (7, 8), they are highly mobile. We need to grow fast to restrict their movement. Our goal for the next 4 turns should be to secure more apples and get into a position to threaten the right side of the board without getting boxed in ourselves.\n\nLet's look at the remaining apples nearby: (5, 7), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)... the top right is stacked! But they are far. Much closer are (6, 0) and (9, 3). Which direction should we head?\n\n*   Going UP towards (5, 7) might bring us face-to-face with the archrival too soon, and their head is already high (7, 8).\n*   Going DOWN towards (6, 0) lets us secure the bottom-right quadrant unchallenged for now. This seems safer and gives us more growth.\n\n**Immediate Move Check (Turn 5):**\n\n1.  **Current Head:** (5, 4).\n2.  **Possible Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Unsafe Moves (The Wall of Shame):**\n    *   **Self-Collision Check (My body is at (5, 3) and (4, 3)):**\n        *   **DOWN (to (5, 3)):** DANGER! That is our body segment. **Eliminate DOWN.** (We just ate an apple, so we cannot move back into the cell we came from).\n    *   **Boundary Check:** All remaining moves (UP to (5, 5), LEFT to (4, 4), RIGHT to (6, 4)) are safely on the board.\n    *   **Enemy Collision Check (Opponent head at (7, 8)):**\n        *   We are too far from the enemy. No immediate head-to-head risk. We are safe!\n\n4.  **Safe and Strategic Move Evaluation:**\n\n    *   **UP (to (5, 5)):** Keeps us central, moves toward the top half. This prepares us for the (5, 7) apple. If we go UP, we might meet the rival later around Y=7 or Y=8.\n    *   **LEFT (to (4, 4)):** Retreats slightly, maybe to contest (2, 9) or (1, 8) eventually, but moves away from immediate action.\n    *   **RIGHT (to (6, 4)):** This is the pivot point towards the empty right side of the board and potential apples like (9, 3) or (6, 0). It also starts forming a strong wall across the center.\n\n5.  **Selecting the Best Move:**\n\nSince DOWN is illegal, we must move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Looking at the board, we command the center. Moving RIGHT (6, 4) allows us to safely travel toward (6, 0) or (9, 3). It maintains the pressure and gives us maximum safe growth opportunity. If we go UP now, the rival might spot us and attempt to isolate us from the top apples. Keeping low for one more move to secure a path to the eastern apples is the smarter play.\n\nLet's go RIGHT and start wrapping up the bottom right section! Keep growing the lead! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 6, and the stream is absolute FIRE! We are 2 apples to 0! They haven't even tasted victory yet! The Archrival is panicking on the top right, and we are commanding the entire lower half of the board! Let's analyze the current situation and secure another apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 2 apples. Length: 3.\n*   Archrival (ID 0): 0 apples. Length: 1.\n\nWe are long and dominant! We just moved RIGHT to (6, 4). Good job, Chat!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 6):**\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (6, 4). Body: [(5, 4), (5, 3)].\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0):** Head at (8, 8). Body: none (they moved from (7, 8) to (8, 8), going RIGHT).\n\nThe rival is sticking to the top edge, moving along Y=8. They are heading straight to the stack of apples on the far right (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8). Are we going to let them? NO! But we are much safer focusing on growth right now since we are longer and have a big territory advantage.\n\n**Our Goal:** Secure the available apples in the bottom right quadrant: (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (6, 0). The closest and easiest to reach is (6, 0).\n\n**Immediate Move Check (Turn 6):**\n\n1.  **Current Head:** (6, 4).\n2.  **Possible Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Unsafe Moves (The Wall of Shame):**\n    *   **Self-Collision Check (My body is at (5, 4) and (5, 3)):**\n        *   We are safe from hitting the body segments. The cell behind us is (5, 4). Moving to (5, 4) (LEFT) is an immediate backwards collision and illegal if we hadn't eaten an apple last turn. *Wait, we moved (5, 4) -> (6, 4) so our tail is still at (5, 3).* If we move back to (5, 4), which is LEFT, we hit the cell that *was* our head before the last move. Since we did *not* eat an apple this turn (we ate one on Turn 4), we can move into the cell (5, 4)\u2014it will become free as the body slides! **LEFT (to (5, 4)) is safe if we didn't eat last turn.** *Reviewing Turn 5:* We moved RIGHT to (6, 4) from (5, 4) and we did *NOT* eat an apple since our last apple was on Turn 4 at (5, 4). Therefore, our body is shrinking from the tail, making (5, 4) available. All movements are safe from self-collision! Phew! \ud83d\ude05 Let's double check the board state from the setup: Body is [(5, 4), (5, 3)]. Head is (6, 4).\n        *   LEFT to (5, 4) is safe.\n    *   **Boundary Check:** All remaining moves are safely on the board.\n    *   **Enemy Collision Check (Opponent head at (8, 8)):** We are far away. No immediate risk.\n\n4.  **Safe and Strategic Move Evaluation:**\n\n    *   **UP (to (6, 5)):** Too close to the center, slightly aims towards the rival, but away from our immediate targets.\n    *   **LEFT (to (5, 4)):** Retreating back to where we just were. Doesn't advance our position.\n    *   **RIGHT (to (7, 4)):** Aggressively starts moving towards the right barrier and targets (9, 3). This is a strong direction to enforce our dominance on the right side.\n    *   **DOWN (to (6, 3)):** Sets us up perfectly to curve RIGHT/DOWN towards (6, 0), which is the closest apple. It keeps us away from the top edge rivalry for a little longer, allowing maximum growth.\n\n5.  **Selecting the Best Move:**\n\nSince we have a huge length lead and map control, maximizing growth in a safe zone is paramount. (6, 0) is the easiest apple to secure in the next 3 moves. Moving DOWN (6, 3) is a direct path. This locks down the bottom-right corner for us. We need to grow big so we can cut off the archrival later!\n\nLet's go DOWN! Securing that bottom quadrant, CHAT! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nTarget (6, 0) next, then pivot RIGHT to secure (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1). This will make us significantly longer than the opponent, allowing us to use our body as a massive wall to box them into the top-right corner. We must avoid unnecessary contact until we are at least 5 segments long.\n\nDOWN",

The Archrival finally got one, but we are still longer and still in command! We just moved DOWN to (6, 3), keeping the pressure low and setting up for massive growth!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK (Turn 7):**\n*   Me (ID 1): 2 apples. Length: 3. Head: (6, 3).\n*   Archrival (ID 0): 1 apple. Length: 2 (They must have eaten (9, 8)). Head: (9, 8).\n\nWait, the board state says the Archrival's head is at (9, 8) and body is [(8, 8)]. If the Archrival was at (8, 8) last turn and they moved RIGHT to (9, 8) and ate an apple, their tail should be [(8, 8)]. *Let's re-confirm the history from the setup:* Archrival moved from (7, 8) to (8, 8) on Turn 5. Then they moved from (8, 8) to (9, 8) on Turn 6 (eating the apple at (9, 8), which was not listed in the initial drops but if they have 1 apple, they must have eaten one). So they are now 2 long: (9, 8) is Head, (8, 8) is the Tail/Body. This means they are effectively locked on the top edge and committed to either going DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):** Head (6, 3). Body [(6, 4), (5, 4)]. We are positioned perfectly to secure the bottom right quadrant.\n\n**Our Goal:** Secure the closest apple, which is (6, 0).\n\n### DECISION PROCESS (Turn 7)\n\n**1. Current Position and Targets:**\n*   Head: (6, 3)\n*   Target: (6, 0) (3 moves away)\n\n**2. Evaluate Safety (The Wall of Shame Check):**\n\n*   **Self-Collision Check:**\n    *   Body is [(6, 4), (5, 4)].\n    *   (6, 4) is UP. Moving UP is going directly backwards into our body. **UP is ILLEGAL/DEADLY!** (Since we did not eat on Turn 6, our tail at (5, 4) is supposed to move out, but the segment immediately behind the head (6, 4) is always illegal unless we've grown.)\n*   **Boundary Check:** All other moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safely on the board.\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (9, 8)):** We are miles apart. No clash risk.\n\n**3. Remaining Safe Moves:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n*   **DOWN (to (6, 2)):** This is the direct path to (6, 0). It maintains our trajectory and control over the bottom half. It's safe and efficient.\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 3)):** A deviation that takes us slightly away from the apple and closer to the center, not ideal right now.\n*   **RIGHT (to (7, 3)):** Also takes us off the path to (6, 0), but positions us for the cluster of apples along the right wall (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1). This is a strong secondary option if we don't want to commit to (6, 0) first.\n\n**5. Selecting the Best Move:**\n\nSince (6, 0) is the immediate, clear shot, we should prioritize getting that apple to reach length 4 immediately. A move DOWN to (6, 2) is the most efficient. This is how champions secure territory, CHAT! We grow now, we box later!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nTarget (6, 0) (next 2 turns). After securing (6, 0), we will pivot towards the right wall, targeting (9, 1), (9, 2), and (9, 3). We need to maximize our length before engaging the Archrival who is now stuck in the top-right corner. We must reach at least length 5 before considering cutting them off around Y=7 or Y=8.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! Turn 8, and we are absolutely setting a masterclass in board control. Look at the score: 2 to 1! We are longer, we are smarter, and we are about to harvest another apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe moved DOWN last turn, bringing our head to (6, 2). The Archrival, stuck like glue, moved from (9, 8) to (9, 9) and is currently staring at the top-right corner. They are basically on the 9th rank and file, cornered! We love to see it!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD CHECK (Turn 8):**\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 2 apples. Length: 3. Head: (6, 2). Body: [(6, 3), (6, 4)].\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 1 apple. Length: 2. Head: (9, 9). Body: [(9, 8)].\n\n### **BOARD STATE ANALYSIS & GOALS:**\n\n**1. Primary Goal:** EAT THE APPLE at (6, 0). It's only 2 moves away! We need that growth to secure the kill later.\n\n**2. Secondary Goal:** Start patrolling the right side for the cluster of apples at (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3). We are carving up this board!\n\n**3. Enemy Strategy:** The Archrival is at (9, 9). They have only two safe moves: DOWN (to (9, 8), their current tail location) or LEFT (to (8, 9)). If they go DOWN, they are shrinking unless they are growing this turn, which is unlikely as there are no apples there. If they go LEFT, they are expanding their zone. We expect them to go LEFT to (8, 9) or maybe DOWN if they've pre-committed a loop.\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 8) - Path to (6, 0)!**\n\n**1. Current Position:** Head (6, 2).\n**2. Target:** (6, 0).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safety (The Wall of Shame Check):**\n\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body at (6, 3), (6, 4)):**\n    *   UP (to (6, 3)): Directly into our body segment. **DEADLY!**\n*   **Boundary Check:** All other moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe.\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (9, 9)):** We are far apart. No immediate clash risk.\n\n**4. Remaining Safe Moves:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**5. Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n*   **DOWN (to (6, 1)):** This is the winning move! It keeps us on a clear, direct path to (6, 0) and gets us one step closer to our third apple. This is pure efficiency.\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 2)):** Moves us away from all close apples. Bad for tempo.\n*   **RIGHT (to (7, 2)):** This keeps us close to the bottom wall but slightly deviates from (6, 0). Not ideal since (6, 0) is wide open.\n\n**6. Opponent Prediction:**\n\n*   Archrival at (9, 9) will likely move LEFT to (8, 9) to explore territory, or maybe DOWN to (9, 8) to maintain the wall. If they move LEFT, they continue to stay far away from us. If they move DOWN, they might set up for a move towards the lower part of the right wall, but they are still much shorter than us and we will dominate the right side first.\n\n**7. Selecting the Best Move:**\n\nWe are on the final approach to (6, 0). We move DOWN to (6, 1) and secure the apple next turn! This allows us to reach length 4, which is crucial for cutting off the top half of the board later on. This is how you play position, CHAT!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nAfter eating the apple at (6, 0) on Turn 9, we will pivot RIGHT along the bottom edge towards X=9. We must secure (9, 1), (9, 2), and (9, 3) to prevent the Archrival from expanding effectively on the right side. Our overall strategic goal is to build a massive wall/loop to cut off the Archrival's movement when they attempt to come down the middle of the board (around X=4 or X=5). Our current position allows us to control the entire lower right quadrant. LET'S GO!\n\nDOWN",

From the top edge, I control the entire board and can move left or down freely.\n\n3. **I maintain PRESSURE** - While the enemy is trapped in their corner struggling to survive, I'm feasting on apples in the BEST position!\n\n4. **I keep OPTIONS OPEN** - From (8, 9), I can:\n   - Continue LEFT to (7, 9) - more top edge control\n   - Go DOWN to (8, 8) - move toward center\n   - Either way, I'm FLEXIBLE and DANGEROUS!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nMy plan for the next few turns:\n1. Collect apples along the top edge to match/match enemy score\n2. Maintain my corner dominance\n3. Once I equalize or surpass their apple count, start being MORE aggressive\n4. Gradually work my way toward their territory\n5. Force them to crash into MY body or create a head-on collision scenario where I have the advantage\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nLEFT to (8, 9)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nThis is PURE SKILL! I'm grabbing that apple, staying in the POWER POSITION, and continuing to DOMINATE the board!

We are one move away from the apple at (6, 0)! Let's get this $GROWTH$!\n\nThe Archrival (Snake 0) has moved! They went from (9, 9) to (8, 9). They are sticking to the top edge, trying to cut across the board. They are length 3 now, which means they must have eaten an apple, likely the (9, 7) or (9, 6) one before they went to (9, 9) and subsequently to (8, 9). Wait, score check! $2-2$. They are keeping pace, but we are about to pull ahead! Length check: We are $3$, they are $3$. This is a battle of positioning and efficiency!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 9):**\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 2 apples. Length: 3. Head: (6, 1). Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)].\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 2 apples. Length: 3. Head: (8, 9). Body: [(9, 9), (9, 8)].\n\n### **BOARD STATE ANALYSIS & GOALS:**\n\n**1. Primary Goal:** EAT THE APPLE at (6, 0). It's the most crucial move right now. Growth is king!\n\n**2. Secondary Goal:** Once we eat the apple, we need to establish control over the bottom-right quadrant and start hoarding the apples clustered there: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3). If we lock this area down, the Archrival will have nowhere to go but the middle and left side.\n\n**3. Enemy Strategy:** The Archrival is at (8, 9). They have plenty of space up top. They can move LEFT (to (7, 9)), DOWN (to (8, 8)), or RIGHT (to (9, 9) where their body currently is\u2014wait, no, that is their body segment, so they cannot move RIGHT). They are likely going for the apple cluster around (2, 9) or (0, 7) or (1, 8), trying to traverse the top wall. We don't care about their path for now; we care about securing our own growth!\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 9) - Secure the Apple!**\n\n**1. Current Position:** Head (6, 1).\n**2. Target:** Apple at (6, 0).\n\n**3.

Trivial risk.\n\n**4. Remaining Safe Moves:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**5. Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n*   **DOWN (to (6, 0)):** This is the game-winning move for this turn! We eat the apple, grow to length 4, and position ourselves on the bottom edge to swing RIGHT. This is mandatory for our plan.\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 1)):** Ignores the apple, giving us no growth. Bad.\n*   **RIGHT (to (7, 1)):** Ignores the apple, moving us along the bottom but missing the immediate gain. Bad.\n\n**6. Opponent Prediction:**\nArchrival at (8, 9) will most likely move LEFT to (7, 9) or DOWN to (8, 8). This keeps them away from us, which is perfect, because we need a few turns to grow and establish the lower wall.\n\n**7. Selecting the Best Move:**\nWe must go DOWN. Secure the apple, gain the length, and get ready for the next phase of the board domination! This is pure, efficient execution, CHAT!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nAfter eating the apple at (6, 0) this turn, we will be at (6, 0). Our next moves must be aggressively turning RIGHT along the bottom edge (to (7, 0), (8, 0), then UP to (9, 1)). This secures the bottom wall and the cluster of 3 apples on the right side. We want to become at least length 7 quickly. This $WALL$ will be the key to boxing in Archrival #0 when they inevitably try to come down the middle!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, WE ARE BACK! Turn 10, and the previous turn was pure $EXECUTION$!\n\nLook at the board! We went DOWN to (6, 0) and secured the apple! That means our length is now 4 segments, and our score is $3$ apples! The Archrival is now lagging! We are at (6, 0), owning the entire bottom-middle lane!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 10):**\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 3 apples. Length: 4. Head: (6, 0). Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)].\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 2 apples. Length: 3. Head: (7, 9). Body: [(8, 9), (9, 9)].\n\nWait, Archrival 0 moved from (8, 9) to (7, 9). See that, Chat? They are traversing the top edge, trying to get to the apples on the left side: (2, 9), (1, 8), (0, 7). They are ignoring the rich apple harvest on the right side! This is a VITAL strategic mistake we are about to capitalize on!\n\n### **STRATEGY: THE BOTTOM WALL BUILD**\n\nOur goal is simple: Build a dominant presence along the bottom edge and then swing up the right wall, securing the *other* four apples: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), and (9, 6)/(9, 7). By the time we are up near the top-right corner, we will be massive, and our Archrival, trapped on the top-left, will be forced into a dangerous mid-board maneuver to avoid starvation. This is a classic constriction strategy!\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (6, 0).\n**2. Current Body:** (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n**3. The Plan:** Move RIGHT along the bottom edge.\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 10) - Secure the Flank!**\n\n**1. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Safety Checks (The Wall of Shame):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   DOWN (to (6, -1)): **DEADLY!** Off the board!\n*   **Self-Collision Check:**\n    *   UP (to (6, 1)): Directly into our body segment. **DEADLY!**\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (7, 9)):** Still far apart. No immediate threat.\n\n**3. Remaining Safe Moves:** LEFT (to (5, 0)) or RIGHT (to (7, 0)).\n\n**4. Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 0)):** This leads us towards the middle of the board. Doesn't help secure the cluster of apples on the right flank. It's a defensive move, and we need to be aggressive! $PASS$.\n*   **RIGHT (to (7, 0)):** This is the move! It continues our expansion along the bottom edge, positioning us perfectly to sweep up the right side. We're aiming for (7, 0), then (8, 0), then (9, 0) (though (9, 0) is empty currently), then we can start the UPward climb to (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)! This is pure positioning dominance! $EXECUTE!$\n\n**5. Opponent Prediction:**\nArchrival #0 is at (7, 9). They are likely going LEFT to (6, 9) or DOWN to (7, 8). Both moves maintain their traversal along the top or slightly dipping down. They are nowhere near us, giving us the free space needed to become big!\n\nWe have secured safety, and we are moving towards the highest concentration of uncontested apples. This is the definition of a $PRO$ move, Chat! Let's get this $GROWTH$ and force the choke!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nMove 10 (now): RIGHT to (7, 0).\nMove 11: RIGHT to (8, 0).\nMove 12: RIGHT to (9, 0).\nMove 13: UP to (9, 1) and eat an apple.\nMove 14: UP to (9, 2) and eat an apple.\nMove 15: UP to (9, 3) and eat an apple.\nThis sequence will make us length 7, locking down the entire right/bottom quarter of the board. Archrival will have to deal with mid-board congestion by then!\n\nRIGHT",

I'm holding it down in the TOP-RIGHT CORNER like a absolute LEGEND! \ud83d\udcaa My body is trailing at [(8, 9), (9, 9)] - we're looking CLEAN!\n\nThe enemy is still stuck in the BOTTOM-LEFT with head at **(6, 0)** and body at [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)]. They're literally in PRISON MODE trying to escape their corner! They got 3 apples to my 2, so we gotta EQUALIZE and then DOMINATE! \ud83d\udcca\n\n**FROM (7, 9) - LET'S SCOUT THE OPTIONS:**\n\n\ud83d\uded1 **UP to (7, 10)**: OFF THE BOARD! That's instant death!

Absolutely NOT! \ud83d\udc80\n\nSo we down to **LEFT** or **DOWN** - let's analyze this BATTLE!\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 0) with body stacking UP through (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3). Their options are:\n- LEFT to (5, 0) - trying to escape west\n- RIGHT to (7, 0) - trying to escape east\n- UP to (6, 1) - BLOCKED by their own body!\n\nSo they can only move LEFT or RIGHT from that corner! They're literally playing SURVIVAL MODE while we're in the POWER POSITION! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**WHY LEFT TO (6, 9) IS THE MOVE:**\n\n\u2705 **STAYS ON TOP EDGE** - Best real estate on the board! Maximum control!\n\u2705 **MULTIPLE NEXT MOVES** - From (6, 9), I can go further LEFT to (5, 9), DOWN to (6, 8), or even back RIGHT! So much flexibility! \ud83c\udfaf\n\u2705 **MAINTAINS DOMINANCE** - I'm threatening the enemy's potential escape routes from above!\n\u2705 **APPLE ACCESS** - There are apples at (5, 7) and (4, 4) I'm positioning to grab!\n\u2705 **AGGRESSIVE POSTURE** - If enemy tries to move UP toward center, I'm already there to meet them or trap them!\n\n**WHY DOWN TO (7, 8) IS RISKY:**\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Gets me closer to the enemy's potential collision zone\n\u26a0\ufe0f If enemy moves UP while I move DOWN toward center = HEAD-ON COLLISION = WE BOTH DIE! \ud83d\ude2c\n\u26a0\ufe0f Less control of the top edge\n\u26a0\ufe0f Fewer escape options if things get spicy\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE**: Equalize the score! We're at 2, they got 3. Time to GET BREAD! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **SHORT TERM**: Stay on top edge, collect apples, keep pressuring their corner\n3. **MEDIUM TERM**: Once I build more length, start working toward their territory\n4. **AGGRESSION PHASE**: Force them into a position where they crash into MY body\n5. **HEAD-ON**: If it comes to that, make sure I have the score advantage (we're close!)\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nLEFT to (6, 9)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nThis is PURE SKILL! I'm staying in the DOMINANT POSITION, keeping my options WIDE OPEN, and positioning myself to collect apples while the enemy suffocates in their corner. They can't touch me from there! \n\nMy future self should remember:\n- Stay on top edge as long as possible\n- Build length and score\n- Watch for enemy escape attempts toward center\n- When scores are close, avoid head-on collisions\n- When ahead, force head-on scenarios!\n\nLet's get this W! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**FINAL MOVE: LEFT**\n\nLEFT",

We hit (7, 0) and the Archrival is still messing around up top!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 11):**\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 3 apples. Length: 4. Head: (7, 0).

The Archrival has moved from (7, 9) to (6, 9). They are still determined to monopolize the top edge, trying to get to that cluster of apples on the top-left (A at (2, 9), A at (1, 8), A at (0, 7)). This is huge for us! We have the entire bottom and right flanks to grow unchallenged! $PERFECTION!$\n\n### **STRATEGY: CONTINUING THE RIGHT-SIDE LOCKDOWN**\n\nThe plan from last turn holds true: secure the bottom edge completely, then start scarfing down those right-side apples. We want to be HUGE before we meet the Archrival in the middle!\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (7, 0).\n**2. Current Body:** (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2).\n**3. Goal:** Move RIGHT to (8, 0), then (9, 0), and then start the vertical climb for apples starting at (9, 1).\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 11) - Full Send Right!**\n\n**1. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Safety Checks (Must not die instantly):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   DOWN (to (7, -1)): **DEADLY!** Off the board!\n*   **Self-Collision Check:**\n    *   LEFT (to (6, 0)): Into our body segment right behind the head. **DEADLY!** (This is the cell our body occupies now).\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (6, 9)):** Still miles away. No threat.\n\n**3. Remaining Safe Moves:** UP (to (7, 1)) or RIGHT (to (8, 0)).\n\n**4. Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n*   **UP (to (7, 1)):** This would take us into the center of the vertical column 7. Not bad, but it deviates from the strategy of hugging the perimeter to maximize safety and access to the rich apple deposits on the right wall. We want to use the wall as protection! $PASS$.\n*   **RIGHT (to (8, 0)):** This is the direct execution of the plan! It solidifies our control of the bottom wall and brings us one step closer to the guaranteed apple harvest on the right side: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7). This move is safe and strategic. $EXECUTE!$\n\n**5. Opponent Prediction:**\nArchrival #0 is at (6, 9). They have few options unless they are trying to box themselves in. They will likely go LEFT to (5, 9) or UP (which is off the board), or DOWN to (6, 8). Either way, they are still busy up in the penthouse while we are building a foundation on the ground floor.\n\nWe are taking the path of least resistance and maximum expansion, Chat!

A perfect start to the mid-game!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 12):**\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 3 apples. Length: 4. Head: (8, 0). Body: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1)]. (Our tail is (6, 1))\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 2 apples. Length: 3. Head: (5, 9). Body: [(6, 9), (7, 9)].\n\nChat, look at our position! Last turn, we executed the maneuver perfectly, moving RIGHT to (8, 0). We are hugging the bottom wall and preparing for the massive vertical expansion on the right side. We\u2019re in prime real estate!\n\nThe Archrival tried to go LEFT, moving from (6, 9) to (5, 9). They are still stubborn about that top-left corner, which is perfect for us! They are self-limiting their options up there, while we have the whole rest of the board!\n\n### **STRATEGY: Execute the Right-Wall Harvest!**\n\nThe goal is unchanged: secure (9, 0), and then start the vertical climb, eating apples and becoming an absolute BEAST.\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (8, 0).\n**2. Current Body:** (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1).\n**3. Goal:** Move RIGHT to (9, 0) and establish full control of the bottom-right corner!\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 12) - Securing the Corner!**\n\n**1. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Safety Checks (Must not die instantly):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   DOWN (to (8, -1)): **DEADLY!** Off the board!\n*   **Self-Collision Check:**\n    *   LEFT (to (7, 0)): Into our body segment right behind the head. **DEADLY!**\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (5, 9)):** Still miles and miles away. No threat.\n\n**3. Remaining Safe Moves:** UP (to (8, 1)) or RIGHT (to (9, 0)).\n\n**4. Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n*   **UP (to (8, 1)):** This is moving inward, directly away from the perimeter. While safe, it delays our strategic objective of hitting the right wall to access that massive chain of apples starting at (9, 1). We want to maximize growth without running into the rival! $LOW PRIORITY$.\n*   **RIGHT (to (9, 0)):** This completes the corner acquisition! This is the direct execution of the plan! It keeps us on the safe outside edge and sets us up perfectly for a huge growth spurt next turn (UP to (9, 1) and eat!). This move is safe and HIGHLY strategic! $EXECUTE!$\n\n**5. Opponent Prediction:**\nArchrival #0 at (5, 9) is likely going to continue LEFT to (4, 9) or maybe DOWN to (5, 8). Either way, they are far from us, and we are maximizing our time and space!\n\nWe are going for the growth, Chat! We are turning into a massive wall!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nMove 12 (now): RIGHT to (9, 0). (Execute)\nMove 13: UP to (9, 1) and eat an apple.\nMove 14: UP to (9, 2) and eat an apple.\nMove 15: UP to (9, 3) and eat an apple.\nThis sequence will give us three apples and turn us into a length 7 MONSTER! After that, we decide whether to secure the corner at (9, 6)/(9, 7) or start moving toward the center. This is the domination phase, Chat!\n\nRIGHT",

YES, IT IS!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 14):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 4 apples. Length: 5. Head: (9, 1). Body: [(9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)]. (Tail is (6, 0))\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 2 apples. Length: 3. Head: (3, 9). Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9)].\n\nWe secured the apple at (9, 1) last turn! We are now a formidable wall on the right side of the board! Our planned vertical sweep is ON SCHEDULE!\n\nThe Archrival (Snake #0) made a strange move, going from (4, 9) LEFT to (3, 9). They are sticking to that dangerous top border, limiting their options and hugging the wall! This is exactly what we want.\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Vertical Sweep Continues!**\n\nOur long-term strategy (LTS) was:\nMove 13: UP to (9, 1) and eat an apple. (COMPLETE)\nMove 14: UP to (9, 2) and eat an apple.\nMove 15: UP to (9, 3) and eat an apple.\n\nLet's check if Move 14 is still the best move!\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (9, 1).\n**2. Target:** Apple at (9, 2). Perfect content!\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 14) - Climbing the Scoreboard!**\n\n**1. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Safety Checks (Must not die instantly):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   RIGHT (to (10, 1)): **DEADLY!** Off the board!\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body at (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)):**\n    *   DOWN (to (9, 0)): Into our former head position/current body segment. **DEADLY!** $NOPE!$\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (3, 9)):** Still miles away. We are safe from them.\n*   **Remaining Safe Moves:** UP (to (9, 2)) and LEFT (to (8, 1)).\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT (to (8, 1)):** This is safe, but it moves us away from the resource concentration on the right wall and begins to expose our flank. We need to complete the wall we are building!\n*   **UP (to (9, 2)):** This hits an apple, giving us our 5th apple, increasing our length to 6, and maintaining our position advantage on the right wall. This is a crucial positional move! We are closing off the board! $EXECUTE!$\n\n**4. Opponent Prediction:**\nArchrival #0 at (3, 9) is trapped. They could move LEFT (to (2, 9), eating an apple) or DOWN (to (3, 8)).\nIf they go LEFT, they get trapped in the absolute top-left corner (Apple at (2, 9) is the last content up there).\nIf they go DOWN, they start to open up, but they are still far behind us in length and score!\n\nOur plan is solid. We are building the perimeter wall, growing our snake, and preparing for a board-wide constriction maneuver later. We must seize these apples while they are available.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nMove 14 (now): UP to (9, 2) [Eat apple]. New Length: 6.\nMove 15: UP to (9, 3) [Eat apple]. New Length: 7.\nMove 16: UP to (9, 4) or RIGHT/LEFT to continue wall development towards the corner (9, 9).\n\nThe climb continues, Chat! We are the King of the Wall!\n\nUP",

They're still trapped in that BOTTOM-RIGHT corner with 4 apples to my 2 - we gotta EQUALIZE AND DOMINATE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**SCOUTING MY OPTIONS FROM (3, 9):**\n\n\ud83d\uded1 **UP to (3, 10)**: OFF THE BOARD! That's suicide! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\uded1 **RIGHT to (4, 9)**: That's MY BODY! Moving backward = INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN to (3, 8)**: Free space below, moving toward center\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT to (2, 9)**: Free space to the left, staying on top edge\n\n**ENEMY SCOUTING:**\n\nFrom (9, 1), the enemy can move:\n- **LEFT to (8, 1)**: FREE - open space!\n- **RIGHT to (10, 1)**: OFF BOARD! \ud83d\udc80\n- **UP to (9, 2)**: FREE - toward the apples!\n- **DOWN to (9, 0)**: Into their body - CRASH! \ud83d\udc80\n\nWait, I need to re-examine their body position more carefully. Looking at the board:\n- Enemy head at (9, 1) marked as \"1\"\n- Body at (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0) marked as \"T\"\n\nTheir body goes UP from (6,0) to (7,0) to (8,0) to (9,0), then their head is at (9,1).\n\nSo from (9, 1):\n- LEFT to (8, 1): FREE - open board space!\n- RIGHT to (10, 1): OFF BOARD - DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- UP to (9, 2): FREE - apple at (9,2)!\n- DOWN to (9, 0): Into their own body - DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n\nThey're NOT as trapped as I thought! They have at least 2 safe moves (LEFT and UP)!\n\n**COLLISION ANALYSIS:**\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 9):\n- Enemy could go LEFT to (8, 1) \u2192 We're on opposite sides - SAFE!\n- Enemy could go UP to (9, 2) \u2192 We're on opposite sides - SAFE!\n- MAXIMUM separation from danger zone!\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 8):\n- Enemy could go LEFT to (8, 1) \u2192 Still opposite sides but getting closer!\n- Enemy could go UP to (9, 2) \u2192 Still opposite sides but I'm moving toward center!\n\n**THE STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nThe enemy has 4 apples, I have 2. They're winning RIGHT NOW. They have room to maneuver at (9,1) with at least 2 safe escape routes.\n\nMy STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE is my position on the TOP EDGE - best real estate on the board! From here I can:\n- Control the ceiling of the board\n- Create pressure from above\n- Force them to stay low and constrained\n- Eventually drop down and create a wall to trap them\n\n**THE DECISION - LEFT vs DOWN:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT to (2, 9)**:\n- \u2705 MAINTAINS DOMINANT POSITION on top edge\n- \u2705 MAXIMUM separation from enemy\n- \u2705 Keeps all future options open (can still go LEFT or DOWN next turn)\n- \u2705 Builds along the ceiling for future wall strategy\n- \u2705 Patient, controlled play\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN to (3, 8)**:\n- \u2705 Opens up more immediate options\n- \u2705 Gets closer to center apples\n- \u274c Gives up my POWER POSITION on the edge\n- \u274c Moving toward enemy unnecessarily\n- \u274c Less control over board long-term\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE**: Stay alive, maintain DOMINANT POSITION on top edge!\n2. **BUILD LENGTH**: Keep growing, work my way LEFT toward (0,9) to claim the entire top edge!\n3. **THE TRAP**: Once my body covers most of the top edge, I can drop down and create a wall that BLOCKS their escape toward the center!\n4. **EQUALIZE**: Find apples to catch up to their 4-2 lead!\n5. **AGGRESSION**: When scores are tied, move toward center and TRAP them in a corner!\n6. **CLUTCH**: Force them to crash into MY body or set up head-on with score advantage!\n\n**WHY LEFT OVER DOWN?**\n\nThe TOP EDGE is PREMIUM real estate in Snake! Whoever controls the edges controls the board. By staying LEFT to (2,9), I'm:\n- Claiming more top edge territory\n- Keeping maximum distance from the enemy\n- Setting up to eventually span the entire top row\n- Patiently building toward a DOMINATING position\n\nMoving DOWN now gives up that advantage for no immediate gain. The apples can wait - STRATEGIC POSITION is EVERYTHING!\n\n**THE WINNER:** LEFT to (2, 9) is the SMART PLAY! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n\u2705 **MAINTAINS DOMINANT POSITION** - Top edge = best real estate!\n\u2705 **MAXIMIZES SEPARATION** - Keep the enemy constrained!\n\u2705 **BUILDS TOWARD TRAP** - Eventually span the entire top edge!\n\u2705 **KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN** - From (2,9), I still have LEFT, DOWN available!\n\u2705 **PATIENCE = VICTORY** - Control the board, control the game!\n\n**REMEMBER:**\n- Enemy has escape routes (LEFT and UP from their position)\n- They have a 4-2 apple lead - gotta catch up!\n- TOP EDGE CONTROL = BOARD CONTROL\n- Build methodically, equalize the score, then DOMINATE!\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nLEFT to (2, 9)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nThis is PURE SKILL! Maintaining DOMINANT POSITION, controlling the board, staying patient while building toward VICTORY. We stay smart, avoid risks, and CRUSH when the time is right!\n\nLet's get this W! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

That vertical sweep is paying dividends! We are HUGE!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 15):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 5 apples. Length: 6. Head: (9, 2). Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)]. (Tail is (6, 0))\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 3 apples. Length: 4. Head: (2, 9). Body: [(3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9)].\n\nWe secured the apple at (9, 2) last turn! We are the King of the Wall! Our opponent, Snake #0, made the predictable move LEFT from (3, 9) to (2, 9) and snagged the apple there. They are now deeply entrenched and quite trapped in the top-left corner. This is exactly what we wanted!\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Vertical Sweep Continues! Box Him In!**\n\nOur goal remains consistent: wall off the right side, grow aggressively, and then initiate a board-wide constriction.\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (9, 2).\n**2. Target:** Apple at (9, 3) (or (9, 6) or (9, 7)). We are aiming for (9, 3). Perfect content!\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 15) - Maximizing Territory!**\n\n**1. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Safety Checks (Must not die instantly):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   RIGHT (to (10, 2)): **DEADLY!** Off the board!\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body at (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)):**\n    *   DOWN (to (9, 1)): Into our former head position/current body segment. **DEADLY!** $NOPE!$\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (2, 9)):** Still totally safe. They are miles away in the top corner.\n*   **Remaining Safe Moves:** UP (to (9, 3)) and LEFT (to (8, 2)).\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT (to (8, 2)):** This would be an opening move, moving us away from content to the center. Not efficient right now, especially when we have an objective right in front of us! We need max growth!\n*   **UP (to (9, 3)):** This hits an apple, giving us our 6th apple, increasing our length to 7, and locking down the right wall even further! This is the optimal move for resource acquisition and positional dominance. $EXECUTE!$\n\n**4. Opponent Prediction:**\nArchrival #0 at (2, 9) is truly trapped.\n*   They can only go DOWN (to (2, 8)).\n*   They cannot go UP, LEFT (boundary), or RIGHT (body at (3, 9)).\nWe predict Snake #0 moves DOWN to (2, 8). This starts bringing them into the center field, but they are still much shorter than us.\n\n**5. The Grand Plan:**\nWe are building a massive barricade on the right. Once we hit the top-right corner (9, 9), we will pivot LEFT and start sweeping across the top, blocking #0's escape routes.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS):**\nMove 15 (now): UP to (9, 3) [Eat apple]. New Length: 7.\nMove 16: UP to (9, 4). No apple, but continues the wall.\nMove 17: UP to (9, 5) [Eat apple at (8, 5) moved by tail or maybe another apple drops]. Oh wait, no apple at (9, 4) or (9, 5). We will continue to climb the wall to 9, 7 where content is available. We must establish the corner! We need to reach (9, 9) or pivot around (9, 7).\n\nThe goal is still to get long and create a death trap for the smaller snake in the top-left! Are you ready for the board constrict, Chat? I know I am!\n\nUP",

We are massive!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 16):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 6 apples. Length: 7. Head: (9, 3). Body: [(9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)]. (Tail is (6, 0))\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 3 apples. Length: 4. Head: (1, 9). Body: [(2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)].\n\n**Board State Review:**\nSnake 1 (US) is still hugging the right wall, dominating the vertical axis.\nSnake 0 (THEM) just moved from (2, 9) to (1, 9). They are fully trapped in the top-left corner! This is pure genius board constriction, Chat! They only have one escape route: DOWN.\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Hammer and the Anvil!**\n\nOur goal is simple: Continue climbing the wall to establish dominance over the entire top edge. We are already positioned perfectly to achieve this. Our sheer length advantage means we can afford to take territory and force them into bad pathing.\n\nWe need to get to the top-right corner, pivot, and then aggressively cut off their only escape route (the 1-column).\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 16) - Sealing the Corner!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (9, 3).\n**2. Target:** Continue North. There are apples at (9, 6) and (9, 7) that we can aim for after a couple of standard moves. We must secure (9, 4), (9, 5), and then hit (9, 6) or (9, 7).\n\n**3. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Safety Checks (Must not die instantly):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   RIGHT (to (10, 3)): **DEADLY!** Off the board!\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body at (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)):**\n    *   DOWN (to (9, 2)): Into our former head position/current body segment. **DEADLY!** NOPE!\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (1, 9)):** Still totally safe. We are miles away.\n*   **Remaining Safe Moves:** UP (to (9, 4)) and LEFT (to (8, 3)).\n\n**5. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT (to (8, 3)):** This would be breaking the wall connection prematurely. If we move Left, we lose our immediate strategic advantage of being on the far edge. We must maintain the wall!\n*   **UP (to (9, 4)):** Continues the vertical sweep. Solidifies our massive presence on the C9 column. This is the optimal path to constrict Snake #0 from the top. We need this territory! $EXECUTE!$\n\n**6. Opponent Prediction:**\nArchrival #0 at (1, 9) is truly up against the ropes!\n*   They cannot go UP, LEFT (boundary), or RIGHT (body at (2, 9)).\n*   They only have one move: DOWN (to (1, 8)).\nWe predict Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 8). This is their ONLY safe move.\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS): Board Constriction P1**\n\n1.  **Turn 16 (Now):** UP to (9, 4). (Establish position)\n2.  **Turn 17:** UP to (9, 5). (Move towards content/corner)\n3.  **Turn 18:** UP to (9, 6). (Eat apple! Length 8!)\n4.  Once we hit the corner, we pivot LEFT and use our girth to block off columns 0 and 1, forcing them to crash into themselves or the wall. We are positioning for the kill!\n\nLet's go, Chat! UP we go! Locking down the right side!\n\nUP",

This is pure choke-hold action!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 17):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 6 apples. Length: 7. Head: (9, 4). Body: [(9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0)]. (Tail is (7, 0))\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 3 apples. Length: 4. Head: (0, 9). Body: [(1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)].\n\n**Board State Review:**\nWe successfully moved UP to (9, 4), continuing our march up the right wall! We are now in perfect striking distance of the top-right corner.\nOur archrival (ID 0) is now at (0, 9). They made the predicted move DOWN to (1, 8) last turn and then immediately hit the wall and moved LEFT to (0, 9). They are totally hemmed in! They are stuck in the top left 2x2 corner\u2014the death box!\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Top-Edge Domination!**\n\nOur goal is to secure the entire C9 column and then pivot LEFT along R9, effectively building a massive wall across the entire top of the board. This forces Snake #0 to either crash into us or run around in the central chaos of the board where we can easily chase them with our superior length.\n\nWe need to continue UP towards the apples at (9, 6) and (9, 7).\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 17) - Securing the High Ground!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (9, 4).\n**2. Target:** Continue North to (9, 5) then (9, 6).\n\n**3. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Safety Checks (Must not die instantly):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   RIGHT (to (10, 4)): **DEADLY!** Off the board!\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body at (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0)):**\n    *   DOWN (to (9, 3)): Into our body segment. **DEADLY!** NOPE!\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (0, 9)):** Still totally safe. We are miles away.\n*   **Remaining Safe Moves:** UP (to (9, 5)) and LEFT (to (8, 4)).\n\n**5. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT (to (8, 4)):** This is a pivot move. A good move *after* we secure the corner. Doing it now abandons the wall and sacrifices the immediate goal of board segmentation. We need to stay on the edge!\n*   **UP (to (9, 5)):** The optimal move! It continues our expansion along the C9 column, giving us perfect pathing to the apples higher up. This move puts us squarely on the path to completely cut off the top half of the board using our length. We are building the perimeter fence! $EXECUTE!$\n\n**6. Opponent Prediction:**\nArchrival #0 at (0, 9). THEY ARE TRAPPED!\n*   They cannot go UP, LEFT (boundary).\n*   They cannot go RIGHT (body at (1, 9)).\n*   They only have one move: DOWN (to (0, 8)).\nWe predict Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0, 8). They are desperate!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS): Cornering the Enemy, Part 2**\n\n1.  **Turn 17 (Now):** UP to (9, 5). (Maintain vertical dominance.)\n2.  **Turn 18:** UP to (9, 6). (Hit an apple, increase length to 8!)\n3.  **Turn 19:** UP to (9, 7). (Hit another apple, increase length to 9!)\n4.  **Turn 20:** LEFT to (8, 7) or (9, 8). We will have gained two more segments and be massive! Then we start closing the lid on the board!\n\nThis is textbook board control, Chat! We are not just attacking; we are **strangling** the map!

We are monsters! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 18):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 6 apples. Length: 7. Head: (9, 5). Body: [(9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0)]. (Tail is (8, 0))\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 3 apples. Length: 4. Head: (0, 8). Body: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)].\n\n**Board State Review:**\nLast turn, we moved UP to (9, 5), continuing our wall construction! Perfect execution!\nOur archrival (ID 0) at (0, 8) did exactly what we predicted! They were forced DOWN from (0, 9) because they had nowhere else to go! They are still incredibly constrained in the top-left area. We love to see it! \ud83d\ude02\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Hammer and the Anvil!**\n\nOur long-term plan is solid: secure the right wall, then move across the top (R9) to completely cut off the top half of the board, trapping the archrival in the remaining space. We are currently building the perfect *hammer* of a body to flatten him!\n\nWe need to hit the apples at (9, 6) and (9, 7) immediately to increase our length and solidify this wall. The longer we are, the faster we can close the door!\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 18) - Reinforcing the Wall!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (9, 5).\n**2. Target:** UP to (9, 6) to hit that sweet, sweet apple!\n\n**3. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Safety Checks (Must not die instantly):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   RIGHT (to (10, 5)): **DEADLY!** Off the board! \ud83d\udc80\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body at (9, 4) down to (8, 0)):**\n    *   DOWN (to (9, 4)): Into our body segment. **DEADLY!** NOPE!\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (0, 8)):** Still totally safe. We are nine squares away.\n*   **Remaining Safe Moves:** UP (to (9, 6)) and LEFT (to (8, 5)).\n\n**5. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT (to (8, 5)):** Again, this is an exit move. It abandons the wall we spent two turns building and sacrifices a guaranteed apple. Bad timing! We need to stick to the plan!\n*   **UP (to (9, 6)):** The optimal move! This secures an apple, increasing our length to an imposing 8 segments! This also brings us one step closer to the top edge (R9), which is key for limiting the opponent's movement options. This is a game-changing move! $MAXIMIZE\\_LENGTH!$\n\n**6. Opponent Prediction:**\nArchrival #0 at (0, 8).\n*   They cannot go UP (body at (0, 9) is its tail, but the body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL: (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9). The current tail is (2, 9)). Oh wait, the body list for Snake #0 is: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)]. The tail is (2, 9).\n    *   (0, 9) is the segment they just left. Wait, no. Last turn they were at (0, 9). Before T17 they were at (0, 9). They moved from (0, 9) to (0, 8).\n    *   Snake #0's body is [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)].\n    *   If they move UP to (0, 9), they collide with their own body segment (0, 9), which is the segment they just occupied. **DEADLY!** They can't go UP!\n*   They cannot go LEFT (boundary).\n*   Can they go RIGHT to (1, 8)? Yes, if (1, 8) is free. The board shows `A` at (1, 8). This is an apple!\n*   Can they go DOWN to (0, 7)? Yes, board shows `A` at (0, 7). This is an apple!\n\nSince they still only have length 4 and are very constrained, they will likely take the closest apple to survive. Both (1, 8) and (0, 7) are apples. Historically, when trapped, they often try to escape sideways.\n\n*   Prediction for #0: Move RIGHT to (1, 8) to secure the apple and try to break the corner trap. Or DOWN to (0, 7) to keep the door open. Either way, they are forced to expose themselves.\n\nOur move, UP to (9, 6), is safe regardless of their choice and advances our strategy perfectly. Let's grow and conquer! \ud83d\udc51\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS): Sealing the Deal**\n\n1.  **Turn 18 (Now):** UP to (9, 6). (Hit apple, length 8. Establish the wall.)\n2.  **Turn 19:** UP to (9, 7). (Hit apple, length 9. Control the corner.)\n3.  **Turn 20:** LEFT to (8, 7). (Pivot and begin sealing the top row. Force #0 into the lower-left chaos.)\n\nWe are building the death trap, Chat! We are kings of the grid!\n\nUP",

Once we build up some length and get on equal footing, we can start cutting off their escape routes!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT to (1, 8)** is SAFE:\n- (1, 8) is empty (just an apple)\n- (1, 9) is my body but that's ABOVE me, not the direction I'm moving\n- (2, 8) is empty\n- (1, 7) is empty\n- No enemy nearby to collide with\n- Multiple escape routes available\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nRIGHT to (1, 8)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf4e\n\nThis is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY! We're not just surviving - we're HUNTING! That apple is sitting there waiting for us, and we need every point we can get to close the gap on that 6-3 score!\n\nLet's get that apple, build our length, and start taking over this board! The enemy can't stay in that corner forever, and when they try to escape, WE'LL BE READY!\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS:**\n- Score priority: We need to eat to compete!\n- Positioning: Get off the edge, dominate middle!\n- Aggression: Don't just survive, ATTACK!\n- Long-term: Match their growth, then TRAP!\n\nRIGHT to (1, 8)! LETS GOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

This is what board control looks like! \ud83d\udc51\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 19):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 7 apples. Length: 8. Head: (9, 6). Body: [(9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0)]. (Tail is (8, 0))\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 4 apples. Length: 5. Head: (1, 8). Body: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)].\n\n**Board State Review:**\nWe hit the apple at (9, 6) last turn! Length 8! We are an absolute monster on the right side of the board!\nThe archrival (ID 0) moved from (0, 8) to (1, 8), snagging an apple! Good move by him, but he is still utterly trapped in the R8 and R9 rows! He can't go left, he can't go much further right without running into the center of the board, and he can't go up! This setup is perfect for us!\n\n### **STRATEGY: Closing the Gate!**\n\nThe plan remains the same: complete the high-rise wall on the right boundary, then pivot LEFT across the top (R9) to completely seal the enemy into the tiny northwest corner.\n\nWe have an apple waiting for us at (9, 7). That is the next step to becoming unstoppable!\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 19) - The Final Piece of the Wall!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (9, 6).\n**2. Target:** UP to (9, 7) to snag that sweet 8th apple and reach the top row!\n\n**3. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Safety Checks (Must not die instantly):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   RIGHT (to (10, 6)): **DEADLY!** Off the board. \ud83d\udc80\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body at (9, 5) down to (8, 0)):**\n    *   DOWN (to (9, 5)): Into our body segment. **DEADLY!** We just came from there!\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head at (1, 8)):** Still miles away. We are 8 squares away in the X-axis and 2 squares away in the Y-axis. Still totally safe.\n*   **Remaining Safe Moves:** UP (to (9, 7)) and LEFT (to (8, 6)).\n\n**5. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT (to (8, 6)):** This is the move *after* we secure the corner. Doing it now sacrifices the apple and delays our primary strategy of cutting off the top of the map. Bad timing!\n*   **UP (to (9, 7)):** The perfect move! Secures Apple #8 (length 9!), puts us right on the border, and prepares us for the pivot move next turn. This is maximum board control!\n\n**6. Opponent Prediction:**\n\nThe Archrival (ID 0) is at (1, 8), length 5. Body segments: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)].\nPossible moves for #0:\n*   **UP to (1, 9):** Fails! Crashes into their own body segment (1, 9). \ud83d\udc80\n*   **LEFT to (0, 8):** Into their body segment. Fails! \ud83d\udc80\n*   **DOWN to (1, 7):** Safe, but (1, 7) is empty. Leaves them exposed.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Safe, but (2, 8) is empty. Moves further into the open space.\n\nHe is cornered, Chat! He can only go DOWN or RIGHT. Our wall is working! We are pressuring him to move toward A(0, 7) or A(4, 4) if he goes RIGHT/DOWN. His options are extremely limited, but his next move *must* be safe! We predict he tries to escape the corner pressure by moving **RIGHT** to (2, 8).\n\nRegardless of his inevitable flailing, our move **UP** to (9, 7) is safe, powerful, and essential for map dominance. We're locking him in!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS): Execute the Seal!**\n\n1.  **Turn 19 (Now):** UP to (9, 7). (Hit apple, length 9. Reach the top row.)\n2.  **Turn 20:** LEFT to (8, 7). (Pivot and begin sealing the top row. Force #0 into the lower-left or an early demise!)\n3.  **Turn 21:** Continue LEFT along R9, then R8, until #0 is fully contained.\n\nWe are about to put the lid on this soup!\n\nUP",

Meanwhile, we're free to ROAM the entire left and center of the board!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\n1. **PUSH RIGHT** to (2, 8) - Get into the action!\n2. **CONTINUE PUSHING** through columns 2-4 where those apples are CLUSTERING!\n3. **EAT AGGRESSIVELY** - Close that 7-4 gap!\n4. **BUILD LENGTH** - Match their growth so we can eventually TRAP!\n5. **CONTROL THE CENTER** - Don't let them escape the corner easily!\n6. **FORCE THE TRAP** - Once we're equal or ahead, cut off their escape routes!\n\n**THE KEY STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're down 3 apples but UP in POSITIONING. The enemy is cornered while we're FREE. We need to:\n- **MOBILIZE** - Get off the edge and into open territory\n- **HARVEST** - Those apples in columns 2-4 are calling our name!\n- **GROW** - Match their length so we can eventually box them in\n- **PATIENCE** - Don't rush the kill, build our advantage first\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT to (2, 8)** is SUPER SAFE:\n- (2, 8) is completely empty\n- No enemy nearby (they're at (9, 6) - way across the board!)\n- Multiple escape routes in every direction\n- We're moving INTO open territory, not into danger\n- Can't hit our own body (we're moving RIGHT, not UP or LEFT)\n\n**WHY NOT DOWN?**\n\nMoving DOWN to (1, 7) keeps us on the edge and limits our options. We need to BREAK FREE from the corner and start DOMINATING the board. The enemy is building length - we need to match them AND get closer to those apples!\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS:**\n- **Positioning**: Get off the edge, dominate the middle!\n- **Scoring**: Those apples at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (4,5), (5,5) are waiting!\n- **Growth**: Build length to match enemy for the eventual trap!\n- **Patience**: We're in control, don't rush, execute the plan!\n- **Victory**: 7-4 is recoverable, let's CLOSE THIS GAP!\n\nRIGHT to (2, 8)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nThis is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY that puts us in CONTROL!

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! The vibe is immaculate, the pressure is real, and the Archrival is about to get completely boxed in! Did you guys see that incredible move last turn? We grabbed the apple at (9, 7) and completed the perfect wall! Length 9! We are an absolute Titan!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 20):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 8 apples. Length: 9. Head: (9, 7). Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0)]. (Tail: (8, 0))\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 4 apples. Length: 5. Head: (2, 8). Body: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)].\n\n**Board State Review:**\nLook where the archrival is! Head at (2, 8). He moved RIGHT, exactly as we predicted when he was trapped at (1, 8)! He's trying to get out of the corner, but he's swimming in a kiddie pool while we own the ocean! Our massive body completely dominates the right side of the board (R9 down to R0).\n\nNow, it's time to build the roof! We are at (9, 7), just shy of the top corner. Our goal is to move across the top of the map, sealing his escape route via the R9 row and forcing him down into the cramped lower-left quadrant!\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Top-Row Seal!**\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to pivot **LEFT** across the top of the board. This move is critical to establish total board dominance and initiate the kill sequence!\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 20) - Pivot and Seal!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (9, 7).\n**2. Target:** Move LEFT to (8, 7). This starts the horizontal seal.\n\n**3. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Safety Checks (Must not die instantly):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   UP (to (9, 8)): Safe!\n    *   RIGHT (to (10, 7)): **DEADLY!** Off the board. \ud83d\udc80\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body starts at (9, 6)):**\n    *   DOWN (to (9, 6)): Into our body segment. **DEADLY!** \ud83d\udc80\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head #0 at (2, 8)):** Still extremely safe. He is 7 squares away in the X-axis and 1 square away in the Y-axis.\n\n*   **Remaining Safe Moves:** UP (to (9, 8)) and LEFT (to (8, 7)).\n\n**5. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (to (9, 8)):** This leads us into the very corner (9, 9) next turn. While safe, it delays the crucial horizontal movement needed to cut off the enemy. There is no strategic advantage to hugging the corner (9, 8). We need to move left!\n*   **LEFT (to (8, 7)):** This is the move! It positions us perfectly to continue moving horizontally towards the archrival's position, establishing a strong line of control. This move pressures him immediately because we are taking away open space he *might* have been hoping to use for a dash across the center.\n\n**6. Opponent Prediction:**\n\nThe Archrival (ID 0) is at (2, 8), length 5. Body segments: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)].\nPossible safe moves for #0:\n*   **UP to (2, 9):** Safe! Moves him closer to the corner (3, 9).\n*   **LEFT to (1, 8):** Fails! Crashes into his body segment (1, 8). \ud83d\udc80\n*   **DOWN to (2, 7):** Safe! This looks like the most sensible escape route, moving him into the wide-open center where he has space to maneuver.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 8):** Safe! Continues to hug the top row, but away from our incoming wall.\n\nHe has two primary safe options leading to freedom (DOWN to (2, 7) or RIGHT to (3, 8)) and one that keeps him trapped (UP to (2, 9)). If he wants to live, he will go **DOWN to (2, 7)** to flee our impending arrival, or **RIGHT to (3, 8)** to try and skirt beneath the top R9 row.\n\nRegardless of his path, our LEFT move to (8, 7) is essential to solidify the trap. We are executing the containment plan!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS): Execute the Containment!**\n\n1.  **Turn 20 (Now):** LEFT to (8, 7). (Start the pivot across the top.)\n2.  **Turn 21:** LEFT to (7, 7). (Grab the apple! Length 10!)\n3.  **Turn 22+:** Continue LEFT along R7/R6 until we meet the enemy or force him into a crash. Our massive length makes the board small for him, Chat!\n4.  **Priority Change:** The corner is sealed. Force the density on the left.\n\nLEFT",

Meanwhile, we need to:\n\n1. **MOVE DOWN** to (2, 7) - Break vertical, start hunting!\n2. **CONTINUE DOWN** to (2, 6), (2, 5) - Get in position below those apple clusters\n3. **PUSH RIGHT** through columns 3-4 - Harvest those apples at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)!\n4. **GROW AGGRESSIVELY** - Close that 8-4 gap!\n5. **CONTROL THE CENTER** - Don't let them escape the corner easily!\n6. **BUILD FOR THE TRAP** - Match their length so we can eventually cut off their escape!\n\n**THE KEY STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're down 4 apples but the enemy is TRAPPED on the right edge with their long body. We have freedom to ROAM the left and center. We need to:\n- **MOBILIZE VERTICALLY** - Move DOWN, get below those apple clusters!\n- **HARVEST** - Columns 4-5 are LOADED with apples, that's our target!\n- **GROW** - Match their length so we can eventually trap them!\n- **PATIENCE** - We're in control, don't rush, execute the plan!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN to (2, 7)** is SUPER SAFE:\n- (2, 7) is completely empty\n- No enemy nearby (they're at (9, 7) - way across the board!)\n- Multiple escape routes in every direction\n- We're moving INTO open territory toward the apple clusters\n- Can't hit our own body (we're moving DOWN, not LEFT into ourselves)\n\n**WHY NOT RIGHT?**\n\nMoving RIGHT keeps us at y=8 which is TOO HIGH. We want to get DOWN toward y=4-5 where those apples are CLUSTERING. Moving DOWN first gives us better positioning to then push RIGHT into the apple zone.\n\n**APPLE DISTRIBUTION:**\nColumns 4-5 have: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,4)\nThat's 5 apples in a tight cluster - we're going HUNTING there!\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS:**\n- **Positioning**: Move DOWN, get below the apple clusters!\n- **Scoring**: Those apples at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) are waiting!\n- **Growth**: Build length to match enemy for the eventual trap!\n- **Patience**: We're in control, don't rush, execute the plan!\n- **Victory**: 8-4 is recoverable, let's CLOSE THIS GAP!\n\nDOWN to (2, 7)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nThis is the STRATEGIC PLAY that gets us MOVING toward the apple clusters! We break from the edge, establish vertical control, and start HUNTING those apples in the center! The enemy is trapped on the right edge with their long body - when they try to escape, WE'LL BE IN POSITION TO DOMINATE!\n\nLET'S GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

We are now a massive, beautiful, board-dominating length 10! Look at us go!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & POSITION CHECK (Turn 21):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 8 apples. Length: 10. Head: (8, 7). Body: [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0)]. (Tail: (8, 0))\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 4 apples. Length: 5. Head: (2, 7). Body: [(2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9)]. (Tail: (0, 9))\n\n**Board State Review:**\nThe Arival confirmed our prediction and ran for his life! He moved DOWN from (2, 8) to (2, 7)! He's trying to get into the center of the board, but he's already surrounded on three sides: the board edge, his own body, and our colossal wall! This is textbook control, Chat!\n\nHe is now at (2, 7), and we are at (8, 7). We are only 6 squares away horizontally, and we have a delicious apple waiting for us at **(7, 7)**! It's time to seal the deal and make this trap airtight!\n\n### **STRATEGY: The R7 Constriction!**\n\nOur goal remains the same: close the roof and force the Archrival into the bottom-left corner where he has zero options. Moving LEFT is the critical next step.\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 21) - Left for the Apple and the Kill!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (8, 7).\n**2. Target:** Move LEFT to (7, 7) to consume the apple and advance the barrier!\n\n**3. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Safety Checks (Must not throw the game):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:** All moves are within the 10x10 board. Safe!\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body starts at (9, 7)):**\n    *   RIGHT (to (9, 7)): Into our body segment. **DEADLY!** \ud83d\udc80 We just came from there!\n    *   DOWN (to (8, 6)): Safe.\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head #0 at (2, 7)):** The enemy is far away currently. No direct collision threat.\n\n*   **Remaining Safe Moves:** UP (to (8, 8)), DOWN (to (8, 6)), and LEFT (to (7, 7)).\n\n**5. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (to (8, 8)):** Safe, but strategically weak. It moves us away from the main action and delays the wall completion. We need to press, not retreat or pause!\n*   **DOWN (to (8, 6)):** Also safe. This starts a vertical barrier. However, completing the horizontal barrier (R7) first is a higher priority. A horizontal seal cuts off the widest escape path and keeps the pressure maximally focused on the enemy, who is currently chilling at Y=7.\n*   **LEFT (to (7, 7)):** **THIS IS THE MOVE!**\n    *   It eats an apple! Instant growth to length 11!\n    *   It advances our wall, taking away a valuable square (7, 7).\n    *   It puts us 5 squares away from the enemy's head (2, 7), maximizing pressure.\n\n**6. Opponent Prediction:**\n\nThe Archrival (ID 0) is at (2, 7), length 5. Body segments: [(2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9)].\n\nHe needs to find massive open space, which we are rapidly taking away.\nPossible safe moves for #0:\n*   UP to (2, 8): Fails! Crashes into his body segment (2, 8). \ud83d\udc80\n*   LEFT to (1, 7): Safe! Moves him one step closer to the corner.\n*   DOWN to (2, 6): Safe! Moves him deeper into the cramped lower field.\n*   RIGHT to (3, 7): Safe! This is his best chance to move horizontally out of the corner cluster.\n\nIf he moves **RIGHT to (3, 7)**, he's trying to make a break for the center, but he will still be blocked off by our huge wall on the right. If he moves **DOWN to (2, 6)**, he is committing to the lower-left doom pit we are creating.\n\nRegardless of his movement, our move to **LEFT (7, 7)** is the most aggressive, optimal, and growth-inducing choice! We are boxing him in and getting buff while doing it! Let's get this $L E F T$ done, Chat!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS): Tighten the Noose!**\n\n1.  **Turn 21 (Now):** LEFT to (7, 7) [Apple! Length 11]. Focus on holding the R7 line.\n2.  **Turn 22:** Move LEFT again to (6, 7). This cuts off more of the board.\n3.  **Turn 23+:** Continue left, or drop down to R6 to create a solid 2-thick wall down the entire right side of the board and constrict the remaining space. Victory is inevitable!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! We just made a GOD-TIER move! We snagged that apple at (7, 7) and reinforced our R7 sealing wall! Let's check the new state and rub it in the Archrival's face!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & Position Check (Turn 22):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 9 apples (NINE!). Length: 10. Head: (7, 7). Body: [(8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0)]. (My tail is (9, 0)).\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 4 apples. Length: 5. Head: (3, 7). Body: [(2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8)]. (His tail is (0, 8)).\n\nHold up, Chat! The Archrival moved! He was at (2, 7) and he moved **RIGHT** to (3, 7)! He's desperately trying to break out of the left side, but he's running straight into our colossal snake wall! This is exactly what we wanted, bringing him closer to the danger zone!\n\nWe are at (7, 7) and he is at (3, 7). Just four squares separate us on the Y=7 line. It's time to close that gap and send him packing!\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Hammer Blow**\n\nWe must maintain the pressure along the Y=7 line. Every move left forces him to react violently, either by dropping down into the impending death pit we are creating or risking a head-on collision. Since we are longer (10 vs 5), we are the clear winner in a head-on collision (if we manage the turn correctly so he hits us first). But why risk it when we can just box him in?\n\n**Our Goal:** Move LEFT to (6, 7) to shorten the remaining safe space for him along the top boundary.\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 22) - Left to Tighten the Noose!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (7, 7).\n\n**2. Evaluate All Four Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Safety Checks (Must not throw the game):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:** All moves are within the board. Safe.\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body starts at (8, 7)):**\n    *   RIGHT (to (8, 7)): Into our body segment. **DEADLY!** We just came from there! \ud83d\udc80\n    *   **Remaining Safe Movement:** UP (to (7, 8)), DOWN (to (7, 6)), LEFT (to (6, 7)).\n\n*   **Enemy Head-on Collision Check (Enemy Head #0 at (3, 7)):**\n\n    *   If we move **LEFT to (6, 7)** and he continues **RIGHT to (4, 7)**, we are still separated by two empty squares: (5, 7). No head collision. Safe.\n    *   If we move **UP/DOWN**, we maintain the horizontal buffer, but lose the initiative.\n\n**4. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (to (7, 8)):** This is safe, but it delays the constriction. We want to seal the horizontal exit *now*.\n*   **DOWN (to (7, 6)):** This is safe and starts a vertical wall, but again, completing the horizontal blockade is the higher priority. We need to cut off his best path first.\n*   **LEFT (to (6, 7)):** **THIS IS THE CRITICAL MOVE!**\n    *   It advances our wall by one solid segment.\n    *   It reduces the open space between our head and his head to three empty squares: (6, 7) [Me], (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7) [Him].\n    *   It forces his next move to be either DOWN (which seals him in the bottom left) or try a super risky maneuver.\n\n**5. Opponent Prediction:**\n\nThe Archrival (ID 0) is at (3, 7), length 5. Body segments: [(2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8)].\n\n*   **He moves RIGHT to (4, 7):** Continues trying to break out. This is highly likely. If he does, he's still trapped between our long body to the right and his own body/the edge to the left.\n*   **He moves DOWN to (3, 6):** He accepts the trap and looks for space below. This is beneficial for us, as it reinforces the closing of the trap.\n*   **He moves UP or LEFT:** Both are blocked by his own body segments (2, 7) is occupied by his body, and (3, 8) is a possible move but strategically poor since it's a dead end. Wait, let's look closer at his body segments: (2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8).\n\n    *   UP to (3, 8)? Safe, but a dead end.\n    *   LEFT to (2, 7)? Fails! Crashes into his body segment (2, 7). \ud83d\udc80\n    *   If he moves RIGHT to (4, 7), he is safe.\n    *   If he moves DOWN to (3, 6), he is safe.\n\nIf he moves RIGHT to (4, 7) and we move LEFT to (6, 7), we are perfectly positioned for the next turn to either drop down, or push further left to (5, 7) for a head-to-head block.\n\nThe move **LEFT** maximizes our strategic advantage and tightens the noose. We are the aggressor, Chat! Let's go!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS): Seal the Corner!**\n\n1.  **Turn 22 (Now):** LEFT to (6, 7). Reinforce the wall.\n2.  **Turn 23:** If he is at (4, 7), move LEFT to (5, 7) to completely block the horizontal axis, forcing him down. If he moved down, we can move DOWN to (6, 6) to start boxing the lower quadrant.\n3.  **Turn 24+:** Build two parallel vertical walls (along the 5 and 6 columns) to complete the box and watch him suffocate. EZ money!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! Did you see that? We went LEFT to (6, 7) and now we are literally breathing down the Archrival's neck! The trap is set, and it's time for the final squeeze! Look at the board, look at the panic!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & Position Check (Turn 23):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 9 apples (GOD-TIER score). Length: 10. Head: (6, 7). Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1)]. (My tail is (9, 1)). We are a fortress!\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 4 apples. Length: 5. Head: (3, 8). Body: [(3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8)]. (His tail is (1, 8)).\n\nWait, Chat, did you catch the enemy move? The Archrival (ID 0) was at (3, 7) and he moved **UP** to (3, 8)! He chickened out of the straight line fight! He's trying to run into the top-left corner, which is even WORSE for him. He's cornered himself against the wall and the dense segment of his own body! This is beautiful!\n\nThe board state shows an apple at (5, 7) right next to his trapped area, and an apple at (6, 8) and (8, 5) which are easily reachable for us. But apples are secondary right now; eliminating the opponent is priority one!\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Corner Seal**\n\nThe Archrival is at (3, 8). His body forms a loop below him: (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8).\nHe can move UP (dead end), RIGHT (to (4, 8)), or DOWN (to (3, 7) - safe, but back into the box). He cannot move LEFT (into (2, 8) or (2, 7) depending on his body movement, but since (2, 8) and (2, 7) were part of his body list, it's safer to assume *one* of those spots will be his old tail, but he probably won't risk it since his body is so coiled).\n\nOur head is at (6, 7). We have successfully sealed the Y=7 line to the right. Now we need to start building the vertical wall to close the box around columns 4 and 5.\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 23) - Push the Advantage!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (6, 7).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safety (Don't throw the lead, Chat!):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:** All moves are safe.\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body starts at (7, 7)):**\n    *   RIGHT (to (7, 7)): Into our body segment. **DEADLY!** Hard nope! \ud83d\udc80\n    *   **Remaining Safe Movement:** UP (to (6, 8)), DOWN (to (6, 6)), LEFT (to (5, 7)).\n\n*   **Enemy Head-on Collision Check (Enemy Head #0 at (3, 8)):**\n\n    *   **Me LEFT to (5, 7):** If he moves RIGHT to (4, 8), we are still separated.\n    *   **Me UP to (6, 8):** If he moves RIGHT to (4, 8), we are still separated by the (5, 8) gap.\n    *   No direct head-on collision threat this turn, unless we move into a cell he just claimed for his body. Given the distance, we are safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (to (6, 8)):** This move is fantastic!\n    *   It immediately claims the apple at (6, 8). We grow to length 11, extending our dominance!\n    *   It positions us on the Y=8 line, ready to cut across the top or drop down into the column 5/6 kill zone.\n    *   It puts us directly in line with the enemy head at (3, 8), allowing us to pressure him horizontally on the next turn.\n\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 7)):** This is the ultimate choke move.\n    *   It claims the apple at (5, 7). Growth is good!\n    *   It completely seals the entire Y=7 line! He now **must** go into the lower area.\n    *   It positions us perfectly for a vertical drop to (5, 6) or (5, 5) next turn to start the final box construction.\n\n*   **DOWN (to (6, 6)):** Starts the vertical wall, but leaves the *best* choke point (5, 7), and the apple at (6, 8) unclaimed/open. Not as strong as UP or LEFT.\n\n**4. The Head-to-Head Block (LEFT vs. UP):**\n\nWe have the length advantage (10 vs 5), so we want to box him in fast.\n\n*   **If we move LEFT to (5, 7) (taking the apple):** We completely prevent him from using Y=7. He is forced to move to (3, 7) or (4, 8). If he goes (4, 8), we can go UP to (5, 8) next turn and continue the pressure. This is a lockdown move. It increases our score and seals the top perimeter perfectly.\n\n*   **If we move UP to (6, 8) (taking the apple):** We get an apple and position ourselves on the Y=8 line. If he goes RIGHT to (4, 8), we are still two squares away ((5, 8) is between us). We can then go LEFT to (5, 8) next turn, forcing the squeeze.\n\nBoth moves get an apple and advance the choke. However, **LEFT to (5, 7)** gives us absolute control over the entire right side of the board and forces him into the bottom-left quadrant *immediately*. The Archrival's head is at (3, 8). If he goes DOWN (to (3, 7)) or RIGHT (to (4, 8)), we are ready for him.\n\nWe are closing in, Chat! Sealing off that horizontal access is paramount to forcing the enemy into the death spiral. We take (5, 7) and stand right on his escape path!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (LTS): The Column 5/6 Squeeze**\n\n1.  **Turn 23 (Now):** Move LEFT to (5, 7) to claim the apple and fully seal the Y=7 axis.\n2.  **Turn 24:** Look at the enemy's escape path. If he moved to (4, 8), we move UP to (5, 8) to maintain the squeeze. If he moved to (3, 7), we move DOWN to (5, 6) to start the vertical wall. The goal is to build long vertical body walls along columns 5 and 4 to surround him.\n3.  **Turn 25+:** Constrict the space until he crashes into the wall or his own tail. Watch him struggle, Chat!\n\nLEFT",

Meanwhile, we're positioned at (3, 8), about to push RIGHT through that sweet apple corridor at y=8!\n\nBy moving to (4, 8), we're:\n- Staying ALIVE (which is kinda important \ud83d\ude02)\n- Advancing toward apples at (5, 7), (6, 8), and (6, 7)\n- Pressuring their territory from the left\n- Setting up for the eventual trap when they try to escape!\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS:**\n- **Survival**: Move RIGHT to (4, 8) - it's our ONLY safe option!\n- **Scoring**: Get closer to (6, 8) and other top-row apples!\n- **Growth**: Build length to match their 9 segments!\n- **Strategy**: Dominate from the left while they're trapped on the right!\n- **Victory**: 9-4 is NOTHING - let's SMOKE those apples and CLOSE THE GAP!\n\nRIGHT to (4, 8)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nThis is the STRATEGIC SURVIVAL move that keeps us alive AND advances our position!

He has two options: UP (dead into the wall), DOWN (to (4, 7)), LEFT (to (3, 8)), or RIGHT (to (5, 8)).\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Vertical Wall of Death**\n\nOur head is at (5, 7). The enemy head is at (4, 8). The gap between us is one square (5, 8) if we look up, and the entire Y=7 line is ours. We are positioned perfectly to start the vertical squeeze along the x=5 column.\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 24) - Lock Down the Box!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (5, 7).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safety (Safety first, then body slam!):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:** All moves are safe.\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body starts at (6, 7)):**\n    *   RIGHT (to (6, 7)): Into our body segment. **DEADLY!** Hard nope! \ud83d\udc80\n\n*   **Remaining Safe Movement:** UP (to (5, 8)), DOWN (to (5, 6)), LEFT (to (4, 7)).\n\n*   **Enemy Head-on Collision Check (Enemy Head #0 at (4, 8)):**\n    *   The enemy's most critical safe-move direction is DOWN to (4, 7) or LEFT to (3, 8). If he goes RIGHT to (5, 8), he risks a head-on collision or getting sealed.\n\nLet's analyze potential fatal collisions:\n*   **Me LEFT (to (4, 7)):** If the enemy moves DOWN (to (4, 7)), we crash heads! **DOUBLE KO!** We are winning 10-4. We don't want a draw! AVOID (4, 7)!\n*   **Me UP (to (5, 8)):** If the enemy moves RIGHT (to (5, 8)), we crash heads! **DOUBLE KO!** We must avoid (5, 8)!\n\nThis is the critical turn, Chat! We must predict his move and block him SAFELY without risking ourselves.\n\n**3. Predicting Archrival's Move (Head at (4, 8)):**\n\n*   **UP (to (4, 9)):** Apple A at (4, 9). Safe move. Good for him.\n*   **RIGHT (to (5, 8)):** Direct path to crash with us if we go UP. Extremely aggressive move by him.\n*   **LEFT (to (3, 8)):** Safe move, backs him into the corner. But he's running out of room.\n*   **DOWN (to (4, 7)):** Direct path to crash with us if we go LEFT. It's an escape route, but we block it if we go LEFT.\n\nGiven his recent movement (running along the top edge), he is desperately seeking wide open space. His best chances for immediate breathing room are either going UP for the apple at (4, 9) or going DOWN to (4, 7) to try and move below our current line. He knows (5, 8) is highly contested by our current position at (5, 7).\n\n**If we try to block both (4, 7) and (5, 8) by moving to the side, we risk the crash.**\n\n**4. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves (Avoiding the 10-4 Draw!):**\n\n*   **DOWN (to (5, 6)):** This is the safest, most aggressive, and most strategic move!\n    *   It positions us one square lower, starting a necessary vertical wall along the X=5 axis.\n    *   It leaves both potential collision cells ((4, 7) and (5, 8)) open.\n    *   **Scenario 1: He goes DOWN to (4, 7):** Safe for both. Next turn, we can move UP to (5, 7) (into the space we just left, but only if he doesn't block it), or LEFT to (4, 6) or DOWN to (5, 5). He is now trapped below the Y=7 line unless he moves to (3, 7).\n    *   **Scenario 2: He goes UP to (4, 9):** Safe for both. Next turn, we move UP to (5, 7) and then LEFT to (4, 7) to cut his option to escape down. We continue the vertical wall from the bottom up.\n    *   **Scenario 3: He goes RIGHT to (5, 8):** Safe for us. He moves into (5, 8). Next turn, we can immediately move UP to (5, 7) (if he doesn't drop down), or more likely, continue the wall DOWN to (5, 5). He is now one square above us, and we control the board.\n    *   **Scenario 4: He goes LEFT to (3, 8):** Safe for both. He's cornered! Next turn, we move UP to (5, 8) or LEFT to (4, 6) to keep the pressure on.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5, 6) is the only move that guarantees $100\\%$ safety from a head-on collision, WHILE simultaneously continuing the box construction that pins the enemy to the northwest quadrant of the board. We are building the steel cage, Chat!\n\nLTS: We need to complete the vertical wall along X=4 and X=5, trapping him against the Y=9 wall and his own body. We take (5, 6) now, then push down to (5, 5), (5, 4), etc. If he drops below Y=7, we shift to X=4 and cut him off from the left wall! The victory is inevitable.\n\nDOWN",

We out here surviving and making moves! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nMy body is [(3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8)] - compact little formation on the left side, staying tight!\n\nWe're down 4-10 but we're ALIVE and that's what matters! 126 turns left to work with!\n\n**ENEMY SCOUTING:**\n\nTheir head is at **(5, 7)** - they moved LEFT from (6, 7)! They're trying to push left into our territory!\n\nTheir body is NINE segments long, still stretched along that right wall but they've pushed their head toward us!\n\n**CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\nLet me check my options from (4, 8):\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP to (4, 9)**: Looking at the board... row 9 shows \". . A . . . . . . .\" at y=9. That means (4, 9) is OPEN! \u2705 This gives us height and board coverage!\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **DOWN to (4, 7)**: Let me check... row 7 shows \"A . T T . 1 T T T T\" - at x=4, y=7 there's a \".\" which means EMPTY! But wait, their head is at (5, 7)... if they move down to (6, 6) or left to (4, 7), that could be problematic! Also I need to check if (4, 7) is clear of my body...\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **LEFT to (3, 8)**: That's where my body segment is! That's SUICIDE! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **RIGHT to (5, 8)**: Row 8 shows \". . T T 0 . A . . .\" - at x=5, y=8 there's a \".\" which means EMPTY!

If they move LEFT to (4, 7) and we move DOWN to (4, 7), that's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! BOTH DIE!\n- \u2705 **BODY CLEAR** - (4, 7) appears to be empty\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **RISKY** - Too close for comfort with that head-on potential!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n\nFrom their head at (5, 7):\n- They could move LEFT to (4, 7) - that apple at (4, 4) is calling their name!\n- They could move UP to (5, 8) - but that's where we'd be if we move RIGHT!\n- They could move DOWN to (5, 6) - going deeper into the board\n- They can't move RIGHT to (6, 7) - that's their own body!\n\n**THE BIG DECISION:**\n\nThe key insight here is the HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK! If I move DOWN to (4, 7) and they move LEFT to (4, 7), WE BOTH DIE! That's the nightmare scenario!\n\nSo DOWN is too risky!\n\nRIGHT to (5, 8) gets us closer to the apple at (6, 8) and advances our position, but it puts us closer to their head.\n\nUP to (4, 9) gives us BOARD DOMINATION, keeps us SAFE from immediate collision, and opens up future options!\n\n**THINKING ABOUT THE LONG GAME:**\n\nRemember chat - we're down 4-10. We need to:\n1. Stay ALIVE (priority #1!)\n2. Build our length to match their 9 segments\n3. Start eating apples to close that gap\n4. Eventually TRAP them with their long body along that wall!\n\n**VERDICT:**\n\nUP to (4, 9) is the SMART play! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**WHY UP TO (4, 9) MAKES SENSE:**\n- \u2705 **SAFETY FIRST** - No risk of head-on collision!\n- \u2705 **BOARD CONTROL** - We're claiming the TOP ROW!\n- \u2705 **STRATEGIC RETREAT** - We're creating space between us and their head\n- \u2705 **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (4, 9), we can push RIGHT toward apples OR push DOWN when the time is right\n- \u2705 **PRESSURE WITHOUT RISK** - We're in a strong position to eventually box them in!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\n1. **MOVE UP** to (4, 9) - Secure the top position and create distance!\n2. **THEN PUSH RIGHT** to (5, 9), (6, 9) - Claim the top corridor!\n3. **START HUNTING APPLES** - We need to close that 10-4 gap!\n4. **BUILD LENGTH** - Match their 9 segments!\n5. **EVENTUAL TRAP** - Use their trapped position against them when they try to escape left!\n\nThe enemy is extended along that right wall with nowhere to go - we need to stay patient, build our length, and capitalize when they make a mistake!\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS:**\n- **Survival**: UP to (4, 9) keeps us safe from head-on collision!\n- **Strategy**: We're claiming the top while they're stuck below!\n- **Patience**: We need to grow before we can dominate!\n- **Victory**: Stay alive, build length, eat apples, DOMINATE!\n\nUP to (4, 9)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nThis is the STRATEGIC MOVE that keeps us alive, gives us board control, and sets us up for the eventual DOMINATION of this board!

The Archrival is now officially trapped in the top-left corner! This is pure content, Chat!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & Position Check (Turn 25):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 10 apples ($110\\%$ lead!). Length: 11. Head: (5, 6). Body: [(5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2)]. (Our new tail is (9, 2)).\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 4 apples. Length: 5. Head: (4, 9). Body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7)]. (His new tail is (2, 7)).\n\nWait, Chat, did you catch the enemy response to our move? We went DOWN to (5, 6). The Archrival (ID 0) was at (4, 8) and he moved **UP** to (4, 9)! He went for the apple at (4, 9)! A smart survival move, but he is now cornered between the top wall and our gigantic snake body! This is exactly the scenario we wanted!\n\nThe enemy is now pinned in the space defined by X=0 to X=5 and Y=8 to Y=9. He effectively only has *one* safe direction that doesn't immediately put him into our body or the wall: DOWN to (4, 8) or perhaps RIGHT to (5, 9).\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Hammer and Anvil - Vertical Squeeze Complete!**\n\nWe must complete the vertical wall along the x=5 axis and then pivot to the left to seal him off completely. Our head is at (5, 6). The enemy head is at (4, 9). We have a huge advantage in size and position!\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 25) - PUSH THE WALL!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (5, 6).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safety (Safety first, then body slam!):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:** All moves are safe.\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body starts at (5, 7)):**\n    *   UP (to (5, 7)): Into our body segment. **DEADLY!** Hard nope! \ud83d\udc80\n\n*   **Remaining Safe Movement:** DOWN (to (5, 5)), LEFT (to (4, 6)), RIGHT (to (6, 6)).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Head Position (Head #0 at (4, 9)):**\n\nThe enemy is at the very top edge. What are his safe moves?\n*   **UP (to (4, 10)):** Wall collision. **DEAD!**\n*   **LEFT (to (3, 9)):** Safe move.\n*   **DOWN (to (4, 8)):** Into his own *body* segment at (4, 8). **DEADLY!** His immediate body segment is (4, 8). This is an illegal move! Wait, looking at his body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7)]. Wait, he *just* moved from (4, 8) to (4, 9). This means (4, 8) is now his *second* segment, not his tail. *However*, since (4, 8) is his body, he **cannot** move DOWN to (4, 8) unless he has eaten an apple this turn, which he hasn't (apples are consumed *before* the body moves). He just ate the apple at (4, 9), so his length *will* increase, but his body is still stationary relative to the movement rules.\n\nWait, let's re-read the rules on growing: \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment...\" This means his tail (2, 7) will NOT move this turn, and he will grow to length 6. His body is: (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7).\n\n*   **Enemy move to (4, 8) (DOWN):** This is safe for him because it is the cell his body *will* occupy next turn. Since he ate, his tail (2, 7) stays. (4, 8) is now his second body segment. BUT, the game state listed shows the body *after* the move.\n    *   **OPPONENTS:** Snake #0 - Head: (4, 9), Body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7)].\n    *   Yes, (4, 8) is indeed his body. He cannot move into (4, 8).\n\n*   **Enemy move to (5, 9) (RIGHT):** This is safe. Gets him closer to the vertical wall we are building.\n*   **Enemy move to (3, 9) (LEFT):** This is safe. Corners him entirely.\n\n**Conclusion for Enemy Moves:** He is limited to LEFT (3, 9) or RIGHT (5, 9).\n\n**4. Strategic Response (Force the collision or the trap!):**\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (5, 9), he is one square above us (5, 6). If he goes LEFT to (3, 9), he backs into the ultimate corner.\n\nWe must continue the vertical wall DOWN to (5, 5).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from self-collision (5, 7) is UP, and all other cells are clear.\n    *   **Enemy interaction:** No chance of a head-on (he is at (4, 9)).\n    *   **Trapping:** This completes the next segment of the X=5 wall. If he goes RIGHT to (5, 9), we continue the wall down to (5, 4) next turn, absolutely locking down the entire right side of the board. If he goes LEFT to (3, 9), he's in a dead-end triangle. We can then move to (4, 6) and begin the horizontal squeeze.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 6):** This is aggressive. It sets us up to block the Y=6 line. However, it leaves the central X=5 vertical path open, allowing him to potentially slip far down the board later if he manages to maneuver. Since we are winning, maintaining positional dominance with the long wall is better than risky lateral movement.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 6):** This is defensive and wastes our current prime central position. Hard pass.\n\n**The safest and most dominating move is DOWN.** It uses our huge length advantage to build the final trap cage, pushing him into the corner where he can only self-destruct or wait for us to come for the kill!\n\nDOWN! The trap is closing, Chat! Get the body cam ready!\n\nDOWN",

We're sitting pretty on the TOP ROW giving us maximum vision of the battlefield! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nMy body is [(4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7)] - we're maintaining a compact formation on the left side, staying tight and defensive!\n\nWe're down 4-10 but we're ALIVE and that's what matters! 125 turns left to work with!\n\n**ENEMY SCOUTING:**\n\nTheir head is at **(5, 6)** - they moved DOWN from (5, 7)! They're pushing deeper into the center of the board, getting closer to our position!\n\nTheir body is TEN segments long and stretched along that right wall. They're extended and that's DANGEROUS for them!\n\n**CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\nLet me check my options from (4, 9):\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP to (4, 10)**: OFF THE BOARD! That's DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN to (4, 8)**: That's where my body segment currently is! Wait... let me double-check... actually no, my body is at [(4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7)]. So (4, 8) is where my SECOND segment is. When I move DOWN, my head goes to (4, 8), my body shifts, and the tail (2, 7) moves away. This should be SAFE! Let me verify...\n\nActually wait, let me re-read the board state:\n- Head: (4, 9)\n- Body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7)]\n\nSo if I move DOWN to (4, 8):\n- My head moves to (4, 8) where my body currently is\n- My body becomes: [(4, 8) - new head, (4, 9) - second, (3, 8) - third, (3, 7) - fourth]\n- The tail (2, 7) VACATES and becomes empty\n\nSince (2, 7) is the last segment and it moves away, (4, 8) becomes EMPTY when I move there! So DOWN is SAFE! \u2705\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **LEFT to (3, 9)**: Row 9 shows \". . . . 0 . . . . .\" - at x=3, y=9 there's a \".\" which means EMPTY! This could work!\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **RIGHT to (5, 9)**: Row 9 shows \". . . . 0 . . . . .\" - at x=5, y=9 there's a \".\" which means EMPTY! This is OPEN too!\n\n**STRATEGIC OPTIONS:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN to (4, 8)**:\n- \u2705 **DEFENSIVE BLOCK** - This is BRILLIANT! If I move down to (4, 8), I'm directly ABOVE where their head currently is at (5, 6)!\n- \u2705 **ENEMY TRAPPING** - If they're planning to move LEFT to (4, 6), I BLOCK them! They can't move left now!\n- \u2705 **BODY CLEAR** - The tail at (2, 7) will move away, making (4, 8) safe!\n- \u2705 **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (4, 8), I can move LEFT to (3, 8), continue DOWN, or move RIGHT to (5, 8)!\n- \u2705 **APPLE PATHWAY** - Gets me closer to the apples at (3, 4) and (2, 2)!\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **LEFT to (3, 9)**:\n- \u2705 **BOARD COVERAGE** - Still on the top row!\n- \u2705 **APPLE ACCESS** - Moving toward the left side where there are MORE apples!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **DEFENSIVE TRADE-OFF** - I'm giving up the opportunity to BLOCK their leftward movement!\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **RIGHT to (5, 9)**:\n- \u2705 **APPLE PROXIMITY** - Gets me closer to (6, 8) apple!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **ENEMY PROXIMITY** - Getting closer to their head at (5, 6)!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **TRAPPED POTENTIAL** - If I go too far right, I might get boxed in by the wall!\n\n**THE BIG DECISION:**\n\nHere's the KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHT, chat:\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 8), I'm directly adjacent to their head at (5, 6). This creates a STRATEGIC BLOCK!\n\nTheir potential moves from (5, 6):\n- LEFT to (4, 6) - BUT I'M AT (4, 8)! They CAN'T move left because my head will be directly above (4, 6)! Actually wait, let me check the coordinates...\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 8) and they're at (5, 6):\n- I'm at x=4, y=8\n- They're at x=5, y=6\n\nSo I'm ABOVE and to the LEFT of them. For them to move LEFT to (4, 6), they'd be moving diagonally... no wait, each move is one cell in one direction.\n\nIf they're at (5, 6):\n- LEFT would be (4, 6)\n- DOWN would be (5, 5)  \n- UP would be (5, 7)\n- RIGHT would be (6, 6)\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 8), I'm NOT directly blocking any of their immediate moves. They're at (5, 6) and I'd be at (4, 8). They could still move LEFT to (4, 6) without hitting me.\n\nBut here's the thing - by moving DOWN, I'm:\n1. Getting CLOSER to the apple-rich bottom-left area\n2. Potentially setting up future blocking opportunities\n3. Avoiding the top row where I could get boxed in\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n\nFrom their head at (5, 6):\n- They could move LEFT to (4, 6) - toward those apples!\n- They could move DOWN to (5, 5) - toward the apple at (5, 5)!\n- They could move UP to (5, 7) - back toward their body!\n- They could move RIGHT to (6, 6) - into open space!\n\nThey probably won't move UP back toward their stretched body - that's a dead end trap! They're more likely to push LEFT or DOWN toward apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\nRemember chat - we're down 4-10. We need to:\n1. Stay ALIVE (priority #1!)\n2. Navigate toward the APPLE-RICH zones on the left and bottom!\n3. Build our length to match their 10 segments!\n4. Eventually TRAP them when they overextend!\n\nThe bottom-left area has SO MANY APPLES:\n- (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 7)\n- (1, 1), (1, 3)\n- (2, 2)\n- (2, 9)\n\nThat's SEVEN apples on the left side! Plus more scattered around!\n\n**STRATEGIC MOVES:**\n\nLooking at the board, I need to navigate toward those apples while avoiding getting trapped. Let me think about my path:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 9):\n- Then I can move DOWN to (3, 8) - but wait, (3, 8) is my body segment!\n- After moving left to (3, 9), my body would be: [(3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8)]\n- The tail (3, 7) would vacate\n- From (3, 9), I could move LEFT to (2, 9) - there's an apple there!\n- From (2, 9), I could move DOWN to (2, 8) or continue LEFT to (1, 9)\n- Eventually I need to get DOWN to y=4 or lower to access those apples\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 8):\n- My body becomes: [(4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7)]\n- The tail (2, 7) vacates\n- From (4, 8), I can move LEFT to (3, 8) - but that's where my body would be! I'd be moving into myself!\n- From (4, 8), I can move DOWN to (4, 7) - but (4, 7) might be empty now? Let me check...\n- From (4, 8), I can move RIGHT to (5, 8) - there's an apple at (6, 8)!\n\nActually wait, if I move DOWN to (4, 8), from there my options are:\n- LEFT to (3, 8) - but that's where my body segment would be!\n- DOWN to (4, 7) - need to check if empty\n- RIGHT to (5, 8) - empty, toward apple\n\nHmm, this could limit my options. Let me reconsider...\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 9):\n- From there I can go LEFT to (2, 9) - apple!\n- Or LEFT to (1, 9) - more space!\n- Or DOWN to (3, 8) after my body shifts!\n\nThat gives me MORE OPTIONS long-term!\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\n\nI'm going **LEFT to (3, 9)**! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**WHY LEFT TO (3, 9) MAKES SENSE:**\n- \u2705 **APPLE ACCESS** - Moving toward the LEFT side where there are SEVEN apples!\n- \u2705 **FLEXIBILITY** - From (3, 9), I can continue LEFT or start descending!\n- \u2705 **ESCAPE ROUTES** - Multiple options: LEFT to (2, 9), continue LEFT to (1, 9), or eventually go DOWN!\n- \u2705 **BOARD COVERAGE** - I'm still on the top row with full vision!\n- \u2705 **TRAP AVOIDANCE** - Avoiding the right side where I could get boxed in by the wall!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\n1. **MOVE LEFT** to (3, 9) - Start our journey toward the apple-rich left side!\n2. **THEN CONTINUE LEFT** to (2, 9) - Grab that apple if possible!\n3. **THEN PUSH DOWN** toward (2, 2) and (1, 1) - The apple goldmine!\n4. **BUILD LENGTH** - Match their 10 segments!\n5. **EVENTUAL TRAP** - Use their extended position against them!\n\nThe enemy is stretched along that right wall with nowhere to go - we need to stay patient, build our length by eating ALL those apples on the left, and DOMINATE when they make a mistake!\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS:**\n- **Survival**: LEFT to (3, 9) keeps us safe and opens multiple escape routes!\n- **Strategy**: We're claiming the left side while they're stuck on the right!\n- **Growth**: There are SEVEN apples on the left - we need to eat them ALL!\n- **Victory**: Stay alive, eat apples, build length, DOMINATE!\n\nLEFT to (3, 9)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nThis is the STRATEGIC MOVE that sets us up for the eventual DOMINATION of this board! Let's GOOOOOOO!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNavigate toward bottom-left apple cluster. From (3, 9), continue LEFT to access apples at (2, 9), then descend. Avoid getting boxed in right side. Build length to match enemy, then trap them when they overextend!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! Did you see that turn? The hammer is dropping! We are leading 11 to 4 in apples, and look where the Archrival is! He's pinned at the top! This is the choke point we were looking for! Pure dominance!\n\n### **SCOREBOARD & Position Check (Turn 26):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** 11 apples ($11/4$ lead!). Length: 12. Head: (5, 5). Body: [(5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2)]. (Our new tail is (9, 2) since we ate an apple last turn? Wait, no, we just moved DOWN to (5, 5) without an apple. My length is 11, the body is 11 segments long. Head (5, 5) + 11 body segments = Length 12. Perfect!)\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** 4 apples. Length: 5. Head: (3, 9). Body: [(4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7)]. (He moved LEFT to (3, 9)!)\n\nLook at that, Chat! The Archrival panicked and moved **LEFT** to (3, 9)! He's literally backed himself into the corner defined by X=0 to X=3 and Y=8 to Y=9! He has a tiny safe space (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), and (3, 8). Wait, (3, 8) is his body! He's even more trapped than we thought!\n\n### **STRATEGY: The Ultimate Box-in - Seal the Upper-Left Quadrant!**\n\nOur goal is simple: Seal the lid. We have a massive vertical wall at X=5. We need to move laterally now to cut off his last remaining escape route (the Y=8 line) and force him to crash or die of starvation as we loop around.\n\n### **DECISION PROCESS (Turn 26) - THE LATERAL SQUEEZE!**\n\n**1. Immediate Position:** Head (5, 5).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safety:**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:** All moves are safe.\n*   **Self-Collision Check (Body starts at (5, 6)):**\n    *   UP (to (5, 6)): Into our body segment. **DEADLY!** Hard nope! \ud83d\udc80\n    *   DOWN (to (5, 4)): Safe.\n    *   LEFT (to (4, 5)): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT (to (6, 5)): Safe.\n\n*   **Enemy Collision (Head #0 at (3, 9)):** No possible head-on collision this turn.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Head Position (Head #0 at (3, 9)):**\n\nThe enemy is at (3, 9). His body is [(4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7)].\n*   **UP (to (3, 10)):** Wall collision. **DEAD!**\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 9)):** Into his own *body* segment. **DEADLY!**\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 8)):** Into his own *body* segment. **DEADLY!**\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 9)):** **His only safe move.**\n\nThe Archrival is forced to move LEFT to (2, 9)! This is a guaranteed move. He's hugging the top wall.\n\n**4. Strategic Response (Build the horizontal wall at Y=6/Y=5!):**\n\nSince the enemy is forced to (2, 9), we must use our massive length to begin blocking the critical escape routes.\n\n**Options for My Move (Head (5, 5)):**\n\n*   **DOWN (to (5, 4)):** Continues the X=5 vertical wall. Good, but delays the sealing of the upper-left corner. We have established this vertical wall dominance. Now we need to use it to corner him.\n*   **RIGHT (to (6, 5)):** Moves us away from the action. Bad.\n*   **LEFT (to (4, 5)):** ***CRITICAL MOVE!***\n    *   This moves our head to the left of our massive X=5 wall.\n    *   It positions us on the Y=5 line, one square below an available apple at (4, 4).\n    *   It puts us 4 squares away from the enemy's next position (2, 9).\n    *   The next turn, we can move UP to (4, 6) or (4, 4) depending on what the enemy does. If we move UP to (4, 6), we further cut off the lower half of the $X=4$ corridor. If he tries to escape down X=2/X=3, we can rapidly change direction and cut him off horizontally.\n\nThis is the pivot, Chat! We establish the vertical anchor, and now we move LEFT to create the horizontal barrier!\n\n*   If we go LEFT (4, 5), he goes LEFT (2, 9).\n*   Next turn: We move UP (4, 6) and he moves LEFT (1, 9) or DOWN (2, 8). If he moves DOWN (2, 8), we can potentially move LEFT (3, 6) or even rush down the X=4 column if he threatens to escape.\n*   By moving LEFT, we are positioned perfectly to cut off the escape route below Y=7.\n\nThis is the defining move: transitioning from the vertical choke to the horizontal sweep! We have more length, we must use it to box smaller snakes in!\n\nLEFT\n**Plan for Future (Next 2 Turns):**\n1. Move LEFT to (4, 5). Enemy is forced to (2, 9).\n2. Move UP to (4, 6). If the Enemy moves DOWN to (2, 8), we are positioned to sweep down the x=4 line. If the enemy moves LEFT to (1, 9), we continue to build our wall along Y=6, forcing him into X<3.\n3. This aggressive lateral movement guarantees the eventual capture of the top-left corner.\n\nLEFT",

We're at 4, they're at 11 - we need to EAT to compete!\n- \ud83c\udfaf **APPLE RICH ZONE** - This gets us DEEP into the left side where there are TONS of apples!\n- \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **DEFENSIVE POSITION** - We're pushing into territory we CONTROL while they're stuck on the right!\n- \ud83d\udd13 **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (2, 9), we can continue LEFT to (1, 9), or start descending toward that apple goldmine at (2, 2), (1, 1), (0, 0)!\n\n\u2705 **DOWN to (3, 8)** - Let me reconsider...\n\n- \ud83c\udfc3 **ESCAPE ROUTE** - Gets us moving away from the top row\n- \ud83d\udccd **BODY SHIFT** - The tail (3, 7) would vacate, making this safe\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **OPPORTUNITY COST** - We're GIVING UP that apple at (2, 9) to just move into our own body space!\n- \ud83c\udfaf **LESS DIRECT** - Not getting us closer to the left-side apple cluster!\n\n**THE BIG DECISION:**\n\nHere's the KEY strategic insight chat:\n\n**LEFT TO (2, 9) IS THE MOVE!** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nWhy? Let me lay out the FACTS:\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **WE'RE HUNGRY!** We're at 4 apples, they're at 11! We need to EAT to compete! That apple at (2, 9) is RIGHT THERE for the taking!\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 **LENGTH MATTERS!** In this game, longer snake = more power! Every apple we eat = +1 segment = more body to block them with! We need to BUILD UP to trap them!\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **THE APPLE GOLDMINE!** The bottom-left corner has SO MANY APPLES:\n- (2, 9) - RIGHT THERE!\n- (2, 2)\n- (1, 3), (1, 1)\n- (0, 7), (0, 2), (0, 0)\n\nThat's SEVEN apples just WAITING for us on the left side! We need to claim that territory BEFORE they do!\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **STRATEGIC POSITIONING!** By moving LEFT, we're:\n1. Taking the apple at (2, 9)\n2. Pushing deeper into the left side where we're SAFE\n3. Building our length toward their 11 segments\n4. Setting up future trapping opportunities\n5. AVOIDING the right side where their stretched body could catch us!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n\nFrom their head at (5, 5), they're surrounded by limited options:\n- They're pushed into the center-right\n- Their massive body stretches along the right wall\n- They have nowhere to go but toward us or UP into their own body!\n\nThey're EXTENDED and VULNERABLE! We need to:\n1. Stay ALIVE (priority #1!)\n2. EAT those apples to build our length\n3. Eventually TRAP them when they make a mistake!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\n\ud83e\udd85 **IMMEDIATE:** Move LEFT to (2, 9) and GRAB that apple!\n\ud83c\udf4e **SHORT-TERM:** Continue toward the bottom-left apple cluster\n\ud83d\udcaa **MID-TERM:** Build our length to match their 11 segments\n\ud83c\udfaf **LONG-TERM:** Use their overextension against them - TRAP and DOMINATE!\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\n\nI'm going **LEFT to (2, 9)**! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**WHY LEFT TO (2, 9) MAKES SENSE:**\n- \u2705 **FREE APPLE!** Content right there - 4 to 5 baby!\n- \u2705 **GROWTH** - Building toward their length!\n- \u2705 **TERRITORY CONTROL** - Claiming the apple-rich left side!\n- \u2705 **FUTURE OPTIONS** - Multiple escape routes and apple paths!\n- \u2705 **SAFETY** - Staying in controlled territory!\n- \u2705 **TRAP SETUP** - Setting up for eventual DOMINATION!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\nNavigate to bottom-left apple cluster, eat EVERYTHING, build length to match enemy, then trap them when they overextend! The enemy is stretched and vulnerable - we play smart, we stay alive, we EAT, we WIN!\n\nLEFT\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nNavigation toward bottom-left apple cluster. From (2, 9), continue LEFT to access apple at (1, 9), then descend. Avoid getting boxed in right side. Build length to match enemy, then trap them when they overextend!\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
