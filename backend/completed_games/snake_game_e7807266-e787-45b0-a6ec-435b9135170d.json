This seems like an easy target, and we can get to it quickly. Additionally, there's another apple at (5, 8), but it's a bit farther away.\n\nAs for the enemy snake, it's at position (0, 9), which is above the apple we're considering. We should be careful not to run into it.\n\nMy strategy for now is to target the closest apple and try to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nNext turn, I'll reassess the situation and consider which apple to target next.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
