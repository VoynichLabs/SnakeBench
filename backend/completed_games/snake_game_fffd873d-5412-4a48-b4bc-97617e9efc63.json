            "rationale": "<think>Okay, I need to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me look at the board and the current positions. My snake's head is at (8,7), and there are no body segments yet. The apples are at (7,2), (6,4), (2,1), (5,0), and (5,5). Enemy snake #1 has its head at (7,1) with no body.\n\nFirst, I should assess the immediate options. My snake is at (8,7). I can move up, down, left, or right. Let's see what each move would do.\n\nMoving up would take me to (8,8). That's within the board, so it's safe. There are no apples there, so I wouldn't gain anything except moving closer to the top.\n\nMoving down would take me to (8,6). That's also within the board. There's no apple there either.\n\nMoving left would take me to (7,7). Hmm, that's interesting because there's an apple at (7,2), but that's much lower. However, moving left from (8,7) to (7,7) is a valid move. There's no apple there, but I should check if any enemy is nearby.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7,1), which is far down. So moving to (7,7) doesn't interfere with the enemy. Also, since my snake has no body, I don't have to worry about colliding with myself.\n\nMoving right would take me to (9,7), but wait, the board goes from x=0 to x=9. So (9,7) is at the edge of the board. Is that allowed? The rules say that if you move outside the range, you die. So moving right from (8,7) to (9,7) is still within the board since x=9 is the maximum. So it's a valid move, but there's no apple there.\n\nNow, considering the apples, the closest one is at (7,2), but that's quite a distance from my current position. Another apple is at (6,4), which is also a bit far. The apple at (5,5) is also in the lower half. Maybe I should start moving towards one of these.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the enemy's position. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,1). If I move towards that area, maybe I can block them or get an apple before they do.\n\nWait, but my snake is at (8,7), which is near the top right corner. The apples are spread out, so I need to decide which one to go for. Moving up to (8,8) doesn't help much. Moving left to (7,7) brings me closer to the center. From there, I could perhaps move towards (7,2), but that's still a long way.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,6) keeps me in the same column but lower. Then I could consider moving left or right from there.\n\nAnother thought: Since the enemy is at (7,1), maybe I should move towards (7,7) and then down towards (7,2) to get that apple before the enemy does. But the enemy is at (7,1), so if I go to (7,7), I'm above them, and they might not be a threat unless they start moving up.\n\nAlternatively, I could move towards (6,4), which is another apple. Let's see, from (8,7), moving left to (7,7), then left to (6,7), then down to (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6), then left to (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) in four moves as well.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (5,5) might be a better option. From (8,7), moving left to (7,7), then down to (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2) would get me to that apple, but that's five moves. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6), then left to (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) in four moves. That seems more efficient.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (5,5) and another at (5,0). So maybe moving towards (5,5) is better because it's closer. Let's calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (5,5): the difference is x:3, y:2. So Manhattan distance is 5.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (6,4): x:2, y:3. Also Manhattan distance 5.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (7,2): x:1, y:5. Manhattan distance 6.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (2,1): that's too far.\n\nSo (5,5) and (6,4) are equally close. Which one should I go for?\n\nLooking at the board, moving towards (5,5) might give me more options because it's more central. Also, the enemy is at (7,1), which is closer to (5,5) than to (6,4). So maybe I should go for (6,4) to avoid the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (5,5), I might have to deal with the enemy approaching. But since the enemy is at (7,1), they might not reach (5,5) before me if I move efficiently.\n\nWait, the enemy's head is at (7,1). If I move towards (5,5), the enemy can move up towards (7,2), (7,3), etc. So maybe I should prioritize getting the apple at (6,4) first.\n\nAlternatively, I could move towards (5,0), but that's quite far. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, there's also an apple at (5,0). That's at the bottom. If I go for that, it's a long way, but maybe I can get there before the enemy.\n\nBut considering the enemy is at (7,1), which is near (5,0), they might get there first if I don't block them.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on the closest apples and see which path is safest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should move towards (7,7) first, to get closer to the center, and then decide from there.\n\nWait, moving left to (7,7) is a good first step because it brings me closer to multiple apples. From (7,7), I can then decide to go down towards (7,2) or left towards (6,7), then down to (6,4).\n\nI think moving left to (7,7) is a safe move. It doesn't put me in immediate danger, and it opens up options to go towards (7,2) or (6,4).\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT to (7,7). That way, I'm positioning myself to approach the apples in the lower part of the board without moving too far from my current position.\n\nI should also consider that if I move left, the enemy at (7,1) is still far away, so I don't have to worry about colliding with them yet. Plus, by moving towards (7,7), I'm not blocking their path unless they decide to move up.\n\nAnother consideration: since my snake has no body, I don't have to worry about running into myself. So, moving left is safe.\n\nI think that's the best move for now. I'll move LEFT to (7,7) and then assess the next steps from there.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm going to move LEFT to position (7,7). This gets me closer to the center and puts me in a better position to reach the apples at (7,2) or (6,4). I need to be cautious of the enemy at (7,1), but they're far enough away that I shouldn't have an immediate problem. Moving left seems like the safest and most strategic move right now.\n\nMy next move is LEFT.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving to (7,7), I'll assess which apple to go for next. I might head towards (6,4) or (7,2), depending on the enemy's movement. I should also keep an eye on the enemy's position to avoid collisions.",

            "rationale": "<think>Okay, I need to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me look at the board and the current positions. My snake's head is at (8,7), and there are no body segments yet. The apples are at (7,2), (6,4), (2,1), (5,0), and (5,5). Enemy snake #1 has its head at (7,1) with no body.\n\nFirst, I should assess the immediate options. My snake is at (8,7). I can move up, down, left, or right. Let's see what each move would do.\n\nMoving up would take me to (8,8). That's within the board, so it's safe. There are no apples there, so I wouldn't gain anything except moving closer to the top.\n\nMoving down would take me to (8,6). That's also within the board. There's no apple there either.\n\nMoving left would take me to (7,7). Hmm, that's interesting because there's an apple at (7,2), but that's much lower. However, moving left from (8,7) to (7,7) is a valid move. There's no apple there, but I should check if any enemy is nearby.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7,1), which is far down. So moving to (7,7) doesn't interfere with the enemy. Also, since my snake has no body, I don't have to worry about colliding with myself.\n\nMoving right would take me to (9,7), but wait, the board goes from x=0 to x=9. So (9,7) is at the edge of the board. Is that allowed? The rules say that if you move outside the range, you die. So moving right from (8,7) to (9,7) is still within the board since x=9 is the maximum. So it's a valid move, but there's no apple there.\n\nNow, considering the apples, the closest one is at (7,2), but that's quite a distance from my current position. Another apple is at (6,4), which is also a bit far. The apple at (5,5) is also in the lower half. Maybe I should start moving towards one of these.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the enemy's position. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,1). If I move towards that area, maybe I can block them or get an apple before they do.\n\nWait, but my snake is at (8,7), which is near the top right corner. The apples are spread out, so I need to decide which one to go for. Moving up to (8,8) doesn't help much. Moving left to (7,7) brings me closer to the center. From there, I could perhaps move towards (7,2), but that's still a long way.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,6) keeps me in the same column but lower. Then I could consider moving left or right from there.\n\nAnother thought: Since the enemy is at (7,1), maybe I should move towards (7,7) and then down towards (7,2) to get that apple before the enemy does. But the enemy is at (7,1), so if I go to (7,7), I'm above them, and they might not be a threat unless they start moving up.\n\nAlternatively, I could move towards (6,4), which is another apple. Let's see, from (8,7), moving left to (7,7), then left to (6,7), then down to (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6), then left to (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) in four moves as well.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (5,5) might be a better option. From (8,7), moving left to (7,7), then down to (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2) would get me to that apple, but that's five moves. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6), then left to (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) in four moves. That seems more efficient.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (5,5) and another at (5,0). So maybe moving towards (5,5) is better because it's closer. Let's calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (5,5): the difference is x:3, y:2. So Manhattan distance is 5.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (6,4): x:2, y:3. Also Manhattan distance 5.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (7,2): x:1, y:5. Manhattan distance 6.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (2,1): that's too far.\n\nSo (5,5) and (6,4) are equally close. Which one should I go for?\n\nLooking at the board, moving towards (5,5) might give me more options because it's more central. Also, the enemy is at (7,1), which is closer to (5,5) than to (6,4). So maybe I should go for (6,4) to avoid the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (5,5), I might have to deal with the enemy approaching. But since the enemy is at (7,1), they might not reach (5,5) before me if I move efficiently.\n\nWait, the enemy's head is at (7,1). If I move towards (5,5), the enemy can move up towards (7,2), (7,3), etc. So maybe I should prioritize getting the apple at (6,4) first.\n\nAlternatively, I could move towards (5,0), but that's quite far. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, there's also an apple at (5,0). That's at the bottom. If I go for that, it's a long way, but maybe I can get there before the enemy.\n\nBut considering the enemy is at (7,1), which is near (5,0), they might get there first if I don't block them.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on the closest apples and see which path is safest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should move towards (7,7) first, to get closer to the center, and then decide from there.\n\nWait, moving left to (7,7) is a good first step because it brings me closer to multiple apples. From (7,7), I can then decide to go down towards (7,2) or left towards (6,7), then down to (6,4).\n\nI think moving left to (7,7) is a safe move. It doesn't put me in immediate danger, and it opens up options to go towards (7,2) or (6,4).\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT to (7,7). That way, I'm positioning myself to approach the apples in the lower part of the board without moving too far from my current position.\n\nI should also consider that if I move left, the enemy at (7,1) is still far away, so I don't have to worry about colliding with them yet. Plus, by moving towards (7,7), I'm not blocking their path unless they decide to move up.\n\nAnother consideration: since my snake has no body, I don't have to worry about running into myself. So, moving left is safe.\n\nI think that's the best move for now. I'll move LEFT to (7,7) and then assess the next steps from there.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm going to move LEFT to position (7,7). This gets me closer to the center and puts me in a better position to reach the apples at (7,2) or (6,4). I need to be cautious of the enemy at (7,1), but they're far enough away that I shouldn't have an immediate problem. Moving left seems like the safest and most strategic move right now.\n\nMy next move is LEFT.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving to (7,7), I'll assess which apple to go for next. I might head towards (6,4) or (7,2), depending on the enemy's movement. I should also keep an eye on the enemy's position to avoid collisions.",

Maybe I should focus on the closest apples and see which path is safest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should move towards (7,7) first, to get closer to the center, and then decide from there.\n\nWait, moving left to (7,7) is a good first step because it brings me closer to multiple apples. From (7,7), I can then decide to go down towards (7,2) or left towards (6,7), then down to (6,4).\n\nI think moving left to (7,7) is a safe move. It doesn't put me in immediate danger, and it opens up options to go towards (7,2) or (6,4).\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT to (7,7). That way, I'm positioning myself to approach the apples in the lower part of the board without moving too far from my current position.\n\nI should also consider that if I move left, the enemy at (7,1) is still far away, so I don't have to worry about colliding with them yet. Plus, by moving towards (7,7), I'm not blocking their path unless they decide to move up.\n\nAnother consideration: since my snake has no body, I don't have to worry about running into myself. So, moving left is safe.\n\nI think that's the best move for now. I'll move LEFT to (7,7) and then assess the next steps from there.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm going to move LEFT to position (7,7). This gets me closer to the center and puts me in a better position to reach the apples at (7,2) or (6,4). I need to be cautious of the enemy at (7,1), but they're far enough away that I shouldn't have an immediate problem. Moving left seems like the safest and most strategic move right now.\n\nMy next move is LEFT.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving to (7,7), I'll assess which apple to go for next. I might head towards (6,4) or (7,2), depending on the enemy's movement. I should also keep an eye on the enemy's position to avoid collisions.",

However, moving to the corner might limit my future moves, as I can only go down or left from there.\n\nMoving DOWN would take me to (8,6).

Plus, it brings me closer to the apple at (7,2) if I decide to go that way.\n\nMoving LEFT would take me to (7,7). That's also a safe move since there's no apple or enemy there.

However, being on the edge might limit my movement options, and it doesn't bring me closer to any apples.\n\nConsidering the apples, the nearest one is at (7,2). To reach it, I need to move left and down. From (8,7), moving left to (7,7) and then down to (7,6), (7,5), etc., would be a good path. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6) and then left to (7,6) could also work.\n\nI also need to keep an eye on the enemy at (8,1). If they start moving up, they might head towards the apple at (7,2).

            "rationale": "<think>Okay, I need to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me look at the board and the current positions. My snake's head is at (8,7), and there are no body segments yet. The apples are at (7,2), (6,4), (2,1), (5,0), and (5,5). Enemy snake #1 has its head at (7,1) with no body.\n\nFirst, I should assess the immediate options. My snake is at (8,7). I can move up, down, left, or right. Let's see what each move would do.\n\nMoving up would take me to (8,8). That's within the board, so it's safe. There are no apples there, so I wouldn't gain anything except moving closer to the top.\n\nMoving down would take me to (8,6). That's also within the board. There's no apple there either.\n\nMoving left would take me to (7,7). Hmm, that's interesting because there's an apple at (7,2), but that's much lower. However, moving left from (8,7) to (7,7) is a valid move. There's no apple there, but I should check if any enemy is nearby.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7,1), which is far down. So moving to (7,7) doesn't interfere with the enemy. Also, since my snake has no body, I don't have to worry about colliding with myself.\n\nMoving right would take me to (9,7), but wait, the board goes from x=0 to x=9. So (9,7) is at the edge of the board. Is that allowed? The rules say that if you move outside the range, you die. So moving right from (8,7) to (9,7) is still within the board since x=9 is the maximum. So it's a valid move, but there's no apple there.\n\nNow, considering the apples, the closest one is at (7,2), but that's quite a distance from my current position. Another apple is at (6,4), which is also a bit far. The apple at (5,5) is also in the lower half. Maybe I should start moving towards one of these.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the enemy's position. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,1). If I move towards that area, maybe I can block them or get an apple before they do.\n\nWait, but my snake is at (8,7), which is near the top right corner. The apples are spread out, so I need to decide which one to go for. Moving up to (8,8) doesn't help much. Moving left to (7,7) brings me closer to the center. From there, I could perhaps move towards (7,2), but that's still a long way.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,6) keeps me in the same column but lower. Then I could consider moving left or right from there.\n\nAnother thought: Since the enemy is at (7,1), maybe I should move towards (7,7) and then down towards (7,2) to get that apple before the enemy does. But the enemy is at (7,1), so if I go to (7,7), I'm above them, and they might not be a threat unless they start moving up.\n\nAlternatively, I could move towards (6,4), which is another apple. Let's see, from (8,7), moving left to (7,7), then left to (6,7), then down to (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6), then left to (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) in four moves as well.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (5,5) might be a better option. From (8,7), moving left to (7,7), then down to (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2) would get me to that apple, but that's five moves. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6), then left to (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) in four moves. That seems more efficient.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (5,5) and another at (5,0). So maybe moving towards (5,5) is better because it's closer. Let's calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (5,5): the difference is x:3, y:2. So Manhattan distance is 5.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (6,4): x:2, y:3. Also Manhattan distance 5.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (7,2): x:1, y:5. Manhattan distance 6.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (2,1): that's too far.\n\nSo (5,5) and (6,4) are equally close. Which one should I go for?\n\nLooking at the board, moving towards (5,5) might give me more options because it's more central. Also, the enemy is at (7,1), which is closer to (5,5) than to (6,4). So maybe I should go for (6,4) to avoid the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (5,5), I might have to deal with the enemy approaching. But since the enemy is at (7,1), they might not reach (5,5) before me if I move efficiently.\n\nWait, the enemy's head is at (7,1). If I move towards (5,5), the enemy can move up towards (7,2), (7,3), etc. So maybe I should prioritize getting the apple at (6,4) first.\n\nAlternatively, I could move towards (5,0), but that's quite far. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, there's also an apple at (5,0). That's at the bottom. If I go for that, it's a long way, but maybe I can get there before the enemy.\n\nBut considering the enemy is at (7,1), which is near (5,0), they might get there first if I don't block them.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on the closest apples and see which path is safest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should move towards (7,7) first, to get closer to the center, and then decide from there.\n\nWait, moving left to (7,7) is a good first step because it brings me closer to multiple apples. From (7,7), I can then decide to go down towards (7,2) or left towards (6,7), then down to (6,4).\n\nI think moving left to (7,7) is a safe move. It doesn't put me in immediate danger, and it opens up options to go towards (7,2) or (6,4).\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT to (7,7). That way, I'm positioning myself to approach the apples in the lower part of the board without moving too far from my current position.\n\nI should also consider that if I move left, the enemy at (7,1) is still far away, so I don't have to worry about colliding with them yet. Plus, by moving towards (7,7), I'm not blocking their path unless they decide to move up.\n\nAnother consideration: since my snake has no body, I don't have to worry about running into myself. So, moving left is safe.\n\nI think that's the best move for now. I'll move LEFT to (7,7) and then assess the next steps from there.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm going to move LEFT to position (7,7). This gets me closer to the center and puts me in a better position to reach the apples at (7,2) or (6,4). I need to be cautious of the enemy at (7,1), but they're far enough away that I shouldn't have an immediate problem. Moving left seems like the safest and most strategic move right now.\n\nMy next move is LEFT.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving to (7,7), I'll assess which apple to go for next. I might head towards (6,4) or (7,2), depending on the enemy's movement. I should also keep an eye on the enemy's position to avoid collisions.",

The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let me analyze each possibility.\n\nMoving UP would take me to (8,8).

However, moving to the corner might limit my future moves, as I can only go down or left from there.\n\nMoving DOWN would take me to (8,6). That's a safe move because there's no apple or enemy in that spot. It also keeps me closer to the center, which gives me more flexibility for future moves. Plus, it brings me closer to the apple at (7,2) if I decide to go that way.\n\nMoving LEFT would take me to (7,7). That's also a safe move since there's no apple or enemy there.

However, being on the edge might limit my movement options, and it doesn't bring me closer to any apples.\n\nConsidering the apples, the nearest one is at (7,2). To reach it, I need to move left and down. From (8,7), moving left to (7,7) and then down to (7,6), (7,5), etc., would be a good path. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6) and then left to (7,6) could also work.\n\nI also need to keep an eye on the enemy at (8,1). If they start moving up, they might head towards the apple at (7,2).

            "rationale": "<think>Okay, I need to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me look at the board and the current positions. My snake's head is at (8,7), and there are no body segments yet. The apples are at (7,2), (6,4), (2,1), (5,0), and (5,5). Enemy snake #1 has its head at (7,1) with no body.\n\nFirst, I should assess the immediate options. My snake is at (8,7). I can move up, down, left, or right. Let's see what each move would do.\n\nMoving up would take me to (8,8). That's within the board, so it's safe. There are no apples there, so I wouldn't gain anything except moving closer to the top.\n\nMoving down would take me to (8,6). That's also within the board. There's no apple there either.\n\nMoving left would take me to (7,7). Hmm, that's interesting because there's an apple at (7,2), but that's much lower. However, moving left from (8,7) to (7,7) is a valid move. There's no apple there, but I should check if any enemy is nearby.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7,1), which is far down. So moving to (7,7) doesn't interfere with the enemy. Also, since my snake has no body, I don't have to worry about colliding with myself.\n\nMoving right would take me to (9,7), but wait, the board goes from x=0 to x=9. So (9,7) is at the edge of the board. Is that allowed? The rules say that if you move outside the range, you die. So moving right from (8,7) to (9,7) is still within the board since x=9 is the maximum. So it's a valid move, but there's no apple there.\n\nNow, considering the apples, the closest one is at (7,2), but that's quite a distance from my current position. Another apple is at (6,4), which is also a bit far. The apple at (5,5) is also in the lower half. Maybe I should start moving towards one of these.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the enemy's position. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,1). If I move towards that area, maybe I can block them or get an apple before they do.\n\nWait, but my snake is at (8,7), which is near the top right corner. The apples are spread out, so I need to decide which one to go for. Moving up to (8,8) doesn't help much. Moving left to (7,7) brings me closer to the center. From there, I could perhaps move towards (7,2), but that's still a long way.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,6) keeps me in the same column but lower. Then I could consider moving left or right from there.\n\nAnother thought: Since the enemy is at (7,1), maybe I should move towards (7,7) and then down towards (7,2) to get that apple before the enemy does. But the enemy is at (7,1), so if I go to (7,7), I'm above them, and they might not be a threat unless they start moving up.\n\nAlternatively, I could move towards (6,4), which is another apple. Let's see, from (8,7), moving left to (7,7), then left to (6,7), then down to (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). That's four moves. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6), then left to (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) in four moves as well.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (5,5) might be a better option. From (8,7), moving left to (7,7), then down to (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2) would get me to that apple, but that's five moves. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6), then left to (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) in four moves. That seems more efficient.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (5,5) and another at (5,0). So maybe moving towards (5,5) is better because it's closer. Let's calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (5,5): the difference is x:3, y:2. So Manhattan distance is 5.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (6,4): x:2, y:3. Also Manhattan distance 5.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (7,2): x:1, y:5. Manhattan distance 6.\n\nFrom (8,7) to (2,1): that's too far.\n\nSo (5,5) and (6,4) are equally close. Which one should I go for?\n\nLooking at the board, moving towards (5,5) might give me more options because it's more central. Also, the enemy is at (7,1), which is closer to (5,5) than to (6,4). So maybe I should go for (6,4) to avoid the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (5,5), I might have to deal with the enemy approaching. But since the enemy is at (7,1), they might not reach (5,5) before me if I move efficiently.\n\nWait, the enemy's head is at (7,1). If I move towards (5,5), the enemy can move up towards (7,2), (7,3), etc. So maybe I should prioritize getting the apple at (6,4) first.\n\nAlternatively, I could move towards (5,0), but that's quite far. Let me check the positions again.\n\nWait, there's also an apple at (5,0). That's at the bottom. If I go for that, it's a long way, but maybe I can get there before the enemy.\n\nBut considering the enemy is at (7,1), which is near (5,0), they might get there first if I don't block them.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on the closest apples and see which path is safest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should move towards (7,7) first, to get closer to the center, and then decide from there.\n\nWait, moving left to (7,7) is a good first step because it brings me closer to multiple apples. From (7,7), I can then decide to go down towards (7,2) or left towards (6,7), then down to (6,4).\n\nI think moving left to (7,7) is a safe move. It doesn't put me in immediate danger, and it opens up options to go towards (7,2) or (6,4).\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT to (7,7). That way, I'm positioning myself to approach the apples in the lower part of the board without moving too far from my current position.\n\nI should also consider that if I move left, the enemy at (7,1) is still far away, so I don't have to worry about colliding with them yet. Plus, by moving towards (7,7), I'm not blocking their path unless they decide to move up.\n\nAnother consideration: since my snake has no body, I don't have to worry about running into myself. So, moving left is safe.\n\nI think that's the best move for now. I'll move LEFT to (7,7) and then assess the next steps from there.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm going to move LEFT to position (7,7). This gets me closer to the center and puts me in a better position to reach the apples at (7,2) or (6,4).

Moving left seems like the safest and most strategic move right now.\n\nMy next move is LEFT.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving to (7,7), I'll assess which apple to go for next.

However, moving to the corner might limit my future moves, as I can only go down or left from there.\n\nMoving DOWN would take me to (8,6). That's a safe move because there's no apple or enemy in that spot. It also keeps me closer to the center, which gives me more flexibility for future moves. Plus, it brings me closer to the apple at (7,2) if I decide to go that way.\n\nMoving LEFT would take me to (7,7). That's also a safe move since there's no apple or enemy there.

However, being on the edge might limit my movement options, and it doesn't bring me closer to any apples.\n\nConsidering the apples, the nearest one is at (7,2). To reach it, I need to move left and down. From (8,7), moving left to (7,7) and then down to (7,6), (7,5), etc., would be a good path. Alternatively, moving down to (8,6) and then left to (7,6) could also work.\n\nI also need to keep an eye on the enemy at (8,1). If they start moving up, they might head towards the apple at (7,2).
