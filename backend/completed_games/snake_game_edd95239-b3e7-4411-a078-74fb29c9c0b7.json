Meanwhile you stay on column\u202f9, the same column the rival currently uses. If Snake\u202f#1 ever slides left toward the bottom, you could be forced into a **head\u2011on** with a rival occupying the same column.

Your snake becomes *longer* and *steeper* on the left side of the board.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f7\u20118:** Keep LEFT if safe (maybe up to (5,0)), otherwise pivot **UP** to climb that vertical spine you\u2019ll build in column\u202f8. This builds a \u201cwall\u201d that snakes can\u2019t snake through.  \n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Long\u2011term vision**  \n- **Choke the rival\u2019s escape routes**: Once you have a solid column\u202f8 pillar (by moving UP after building bottom length), Snake\u202f#1 will be forced to go *right* or *up* only, both of which will put him squarely in your cross\u2011hair.  \n- **Force a head\u2011on** when you\u2019re ahead: With a lead of 3 vs 1, a daring **RIGHT** on a later turn (while you hold the left wall) creates a guaranteed collision if they ever try to cross the middle lane. The score gap makes that \u201cdouble\u2011KO\u201d a *win* rather than a *danger*.  \n\n\ud83e\udd14 **Is there any hidden trap?**  \nWhat if Snake\u202f#1 decides to *left\u2011slide* now and ends up on (8,7) while you\u2019re on (7,0)? Still miles apart \u2013 no immediate risk. Their best safe option is LEFT, which simply lengthens their own column and *gives you space* to grow.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Bottom line**: The ONLY move that keeps you alive *and* expands your growth horizon is **LEFT**. It respects the board, denies the enemy a free passage, and sets the stage for a future *perfect choke\u2011play* that will either **kill them** or **force a double KO** when you\u2019re already ahead.  \n\n\ud83d\udc40 *Remember: don\u2019t over\u2011commit, keep the board breathing, and always ask yourself \u2013 \u201cWhere can they hide?\u201d*  \n\n\ud83d\udc4a **Final verdict** \u2013 move **LEFT** and start building that wall!  \n\nLEFT",

Eating it gives you +1 length \u2192 you\u2019ll be a 9\u2011segment monster.  \n- **Future choke\u2011point:** After you swallow, you can **UP** again to (8,\u202f4) on the next turn, directly over the enemy\u2019s current head. The enemy only has a single body cell (8,\u202f5) \u2013 they can\u2019t go down (that would hit their own body) and they\u2019ll be forced left/right, leaving the middle column open for you to slam them head\u2011on or corner them with your longer tail.  \n\n**\ud83e\udd14 Will they bite you?**  \nIf they try to **DOWN** into (8,\u202f3) you\u2019ll collide \u2192 both die \u2192 *you* win the round because you have 7 vs their 1 apples. If they go left/right, you\u2019ve already gained length to press them tighter. Either way, UP gives you the highest chance of a *controlled* double\u2011KO while staying alive now.  \n\n**\ud83d\udca5 Long\u2011term playbook**  \n- **Turn\u202f13:** UP to (8,\u202f3) \u2013 claim apple, become 9\u2011segment.  \n- **Turn\u202f14:** UP again to (8,\u202f4) \u2013 land on enemy\u2019s head, push them into a forced move.  \n- **Turn\u202f15:** Move RIGHT (or LEFT) to (9,\u202f4)/(7,\u202f4) \u2013 force them into a narrow corridor; your extended tail blocks exit.  \n- **Turns\u202f16\u201118:** Finish with a downward slide, tightening the noose until they either crash into your body or bite the dust.  \n\nUP",
