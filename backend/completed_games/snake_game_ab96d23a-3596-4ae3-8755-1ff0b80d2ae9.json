It's 2 steps from me (would require LEFT then LEFT), so contesting it is risky \u2014 enemy has the immediate advantage.\n- Moving LEFT would close distance to the enemy and to that contested apple, increasing risk of interaction. Moving RIGHT goes toward the board edge and limits options. Moving DOWN goes away from the dense apple area.\n- Moving UP to (8,5) keeps many follow-up options (UP/LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN), moves me towards a cluster of apples to the north (e.g., (8,7), (6,5), (5,6)), and avoids walking into the enemy's neighborhood where he can claim the nearby apple quickly.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move UP now to (8,5). From there aim for (8,7) or swing west toward the cluster around (6,5)/(5,6) depending on enemy moves.\n- Avoid moving into tight areas near the enemy; prefer staying in open space with multiple escape options to reduce chance of head-on or trap.\n- If the enemy commits to the (6,4) apple and grows, give him space and collect less-contested apples to build an advantage.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current state. The board is 10x10. I am Snake #0 with head at (6,3) and no body segments (length 1). The enemy Snake #1 is at (8,4), also length 1. There are many apples scattered, but the most immediate ones relative to my position are:\n- (6,4) is directly North (Up) of me.\n- (5,6) and (3,5) are in the Northwest quadrant.\n- (6,5) is also relatively close.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,4). The enemy is likely looking for apples too. The apple at (6,4) is in my direct path, but (8,4) is closer to some apples in the eastern part of the board, like (9,6) or (7,2).\n\nI need to avoid immediate death. Since I have no body, I cannot collide with myself except by reversing, but since length is 1, I can technically move in any direction (though moving back is usually discouraged). However, the rule says \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Since I have no body, there is no cell directly behind my head. Wait, \"directly behind\" implies the second segment. If length is 1, there is no second segment. So moving \"back\" (if I defined a back based on a previous move, which doesn't exist) might be ambiguous, but generally, for length 1, any move is safe regarding self-collision.\n\nWait, actually, the rule says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" and \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nWith length 1, there is no body. So moving in any direction is safe regarding self-collision.\n\nHowever, I must consider the enemy. The enemy is at (8,4). I am at (6,3). The distance is sqrt((8-6)^2 + (4-3)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5) \u2248 2.23. This is not an immediate threat for head-on collision unless we move into the same square. The only square we could both move into that is adjacent to both heads is (7,3) or (7,4) or (6,4). Let's check adjacency:\n- My neighbors: (6,4) Up, (6,2) Down, (5,3) Left, (7,3) Right.\n- Enemy neighbors: (8,5) Up, (8,3) Down, (7,4) Left, (9,4) Right.\nCommon adjacent squares: (7,3) is my Right, Enemy's (7,4) is Left? No, (7,3) is not an enemy neighbor. Enemy is at (8,4).\nWait, (7,4) is Enemy's Left. Is (7,4) my neighbor? I am at (6,3). My neighbors are (6,4), (6,2), (5,3), (7,3). (7,4) is not adjacent to (6,3).\n(7,3) is my Right. Is (7,3) enemy neighbor? Enemy is at (8,4). Enemy neighbors: (8,5), (8,3), (7,4), (9,4). (7,3) is not a neighbor.\nSo there is no square that is adjacent to both heads. We cannot collide directly this turn unless one of us moves into the other's current spot, but the other is moving away. Actually, simultaneous movement means we swap places? If I move Right to (7,3) and Enemy moves Left to (7,4), no collision. If I move Right to (7,3) and Enemy moves Down to (8,3), no collision.\nCollision only happens if heads land on the same cell. Since no cell is adjacent to both, we cannot land on the same cell this turn.\nAlso, we cannot crash into each other's bodies because we both have length 1.\n\nSo, no immediate threat of collision with the enemy.\n\nI need to prioritize safety. The board has walls. I am at (6,3). I should check the board boundaries.\nFrom (6,3):\n- Up (6,4): On board. Contains an Apple 'A'.\n- Down (6,2): On board. Contains an Apple 'A'.\n- Left (5,3): On board. Is it empty? Board state at y=3 row: \". . . . . . 0 . . .\" (Indices 0-9). Index 5 is '.', so empty.\n- Right (7,3): On board. Is it empty? Index 7 is '.', so empty.\n\nAll four directions are safe regarding walls and bodies.\n\nNow, which move is best?\nI see apples at (6,4) and (6,2).\n(6,4) is Up. If I go Up, I eat an apple and grow. My head becomes (6,4), and my body will eventually occupy (6,3).\n(6,2) is Down. If I go Down, I eat an apple and grow. My head becomes (6,2).\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 4: \". A . . . . A . 1 .\"\nWait, the enemy is at (8,4). In the board state provided:\nRow 4: \". A . . . . A . 1 .\"\nIndices: 0: ., 1: A, 2: ., 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: A, 7: ., 8: 1, 9: .\nSo enemy is indeed at (8,4).\n\nIf I move Up to (6,4):\nI eat the apple. My new head (6,4). Body (6,3).\nIs this safe?\nCheck enemy move. Enemy at (8,4).\nPossible enemy moves:\n- Up to (8,5). Apple at (9,6) is not immediate, but maybe?\n- Down to (8,3). Apple at (9,6)...\n- Left to (7,4). Is (7,4) occupied? Row 4 index 7 is '.'.\n- Right to (9,4). Is (9,4) occupied? Row 4 index 9 is '.'.\nIf enemy moves Left to (7,4), and I am at (6,4), heads are (6,4) and (7,4). No collision.\nIf I am at (6,4), and enemy moves Left into (7,4), no issue.\nIf I move Up, I am at (6,4). My body is at (6,3). If enemy moves Down to (8,3), no issue.\nIf I move Up, and enemy moves... could enemy move to (6,4)? No, (6,4) is not adjacent to (8,4).\nCould enemy move to (6,3)? (6,3) is not adjacent to (8,4).\nSo moving Up seems safe.\n\nIf I move Down to (6,2):\nI eat the apple at (6,2).\nMy head (6,2), body (6,3).\nCheck board row 2: \". . A . A . . A . .\" (Indices 0-9).\n(6,2) is '.' (empty).\nIf I move Down, is it safe?\nEnemy at (8,4) is far. No immediate collision.\nHowever, looking at the board, there is a \"1\" at (8,4) which is the enemy.\nLet's look at the apples. There is a cluster of apples.\n(6,4) and (6,2) are both accessible.\nHowever, (6,4) puts me closer to other apples?\nLooking at row 5: \". . A A . . A . . .\"\nApples at (2,5), (3,5), (6,5).\nRow 6: \". A . . . A . . . A\"\nApples at (1,6), (5,6), (9,6).\nRow 4 has an apple at (6,4) and (1,4).\nRow 3 has no apples (row 3 is \"...0...\").\nRow 2 has apples at (2,2), (4,2), (7,2).\n\nIf I go Up to (6,4), I am in row 4. From there, I can access apples at (6,5) (Up), (5,6) (Up-Left), (3,5) (Left-Left-Up), (2,5), etc.\nIf I go Down to (6,2), I am in row 2. From there, I can access apples at (6,2) (eat), then maybe (7,2), (4,2), (2,2).\nHowever, the cluster of apples seems denser in the upper region (rows 4, 5, 6).\nSpecifically, look at (3,5), (2,5), (1,6), (1,4), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9). There is a wall of apples on the left side.\nAlso, (5,6) is accessible.\nThe enemy is at (8,4), which is on the right side.\nIf I go Up, I move towards the central/dense area. If I go Down, I move towards the bottom left.\nThe bottom left has apples at (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,6), (2,5), (2,2), etc. Actually, (0,7), (0,8), (0,9) are high up.\nWait, (0,7) is y=7. (0,8) y=8. (0,9) y=9.\nI am at y=3.\nIf I go Up, I go towards y=4,5,6...\nIf I go Down, I go towards y=2,1,0.\nThe apples at (0,8) and (0,9) are very far from me if I go Down. They are \"Up\" from me.\nWait, (0,8) is x=0, y=8. I am at x=6, y=3. It is North-West.\nTo reach (0,8), I need to go Left and Up.\nIf I go Down to (6,2), I am moving away from (0,8) (increasing distance in Y).\nIf I go Up to (6,4), I am moving closer in Y to 8.\nSo Up is better for reaching the left-side apples.\n\nWhat about the enemy?\nThe enemy is at (8,4). If I go Up to (6,4), I am closer to the enemy (distance 2).\nIf I go Down to (6,2), I am further away (distance sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = 2.8).\nHowever, the apples are the objective.\nIf I go Up to (6,4), I secure an apple immediately.\nIf I go Down to (6,2), I secure an apple immediately.\nBoth are 1 apple.\n\nLet's analyze the future moves.\nIf I am at (6,4) (Head), Body (6,3).\nPossible moves: (6,5), (5,4), (7,4), (6,3) (backwards - invalid).\n(6,5) has an apple.\n(5,4) is empty.\n(7,4) is empty.\nIf I am at (6,2) (Head), Body (6,3).\nPossible moves: (6,3) (backwards - invalid), (6,1), (5,2), (7,2).\n(6,1) is empty.\n(5,2) is empty.\n(7,2) has an apple.\n\nSo from (6,4), I have 3 safe moves, and one leads to an apple (6,5).\nFrom (6,2), I have 3 safe moves, and one leads to an apple (7,2).\nHowever, (6,5) is part of a cluster. (5,6) is adjacent to (6,5).\n(7,2) is somewhat isolated. (5,2) and (6,1) are empty. (4,2) is an apple but requires 2 moves.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 5: \". . A A . . A . . .\"\nRow 6: \". A . . . A . . . A\"\nRow 4: \". A . . . . A . 1 .\"\nRow 3: \". . . . . . 0 . . .\" (My current pos)\nRow 2: \". . A . A . . A . .\"\n\nIf I go Up to (6,4):\nI am in row 4.\nNext, I can go Up to (6,5) (Apple).\nThen Up to (6,6). Row 6 index 6 is '.'.\nOr Left to (5,4). Row 4 index 5 is '.'.\nOr Right to (7,4). Row 4 index 7 is '.'.\nIf I go Up to (6,5) (Apple), my body becomes (6,4), (6,3).\nFrom (6,5), I can go Up to (6,6) (empty), Left to (5,5) (empty), Right to (7,5) (empty).\nWait, (5,5) is empty? Row 5: \". . A A . . A . . .\" Indices 0-9.\nIndex 0: ., 1: ., 2: A, 3: A, 4: ., 5: ., 6: A...\nSo (5,5) is index 5, which is '.'.\n(6,5) is index 6, which is 'A'.\n(4,5) is index 4, which is '.'.\nSo from (6,5), I can go Left to (5,5).\nFrom (5,5), I can go Left to (4,5) (empty), Left-Left to (3,5) (Apple).\nSo the path 6,4 -> 6,5 -> 5,5 -> 3,5 allows me to eat (6,4), (6,5), (3,5).\n(3,5) is an apple.\n(2,5) is also an apple.\nThis is a very good route.\n\nIf I go Down to (6,2):\nI eat (6,2).\nNext moves: (6,1), (5,2), (7,2).\n(7,2) is an apple.\nIf I go to (7,2):\nFrom (7,2), I can go Left to (6,2) (occupied by my body if I grew? No, if I ate (6,2), my body is (6,3). Wait.\nIf I start at (6,3), move Down to (6,2) (eat apple).\nHead (6,2). Body (6,3).\nFrom (6,2), I can move Right to (7,2) (eat apple).\nHead (7,2). Body (6,2), (6,3).\nFrom (7,2), I can move Left to (6,2) (occupied by body 1,2,3... no, 2nd segment is (6,2). So I die if I go back).\nI can move Up to (7,3) (empty). Row 3 index 7 is '.'.\nI can move Down to (7,1) (empty). Row 1 index 7 is '.'.\nSo from (7,2), I can go Up to (7,3).\nFrom (7,3), I can go Left to (6,3) (occupied by tail).\nOr Up to (7,4).\n(7,4) is empty.\nFrom (7,4), I can go Up to (7,5) (empty), Left to (6,4) (empty? Wait, if I didn't go there).\nActually, if I went Down, I haven't touched the upper board.\n(6,4) is empty.\nSo I could loop back.\nHowever, looking at the apples:\nUpper route: (6,4), (6,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,6), (1,4), (0,7)...\nLower route: (6,2), (7,2), (4,2), (2,2)...\nThe upper route seems to have a denser cluster and leads towards the high-value apples at (0,7), (0,8), (0,9).\nAlso, the upper route avoids the bottom-left corner which might be a trap later (dead end).\nThe upper route has more open space in the middle/top.\n\nLet's consider the enemy again.\nEnemy at (8,4).\nIf I go Up to (6,4), I am closer to the enemy.\nThe enemy might want to eat (6,4) too? No, (6,4) is not adjacent to (8,4).\nEnemy neighbors: (8,5), (8,3), (7,4), (9,4).\nNone of these are (6,4).\nSo enemy cannot steal (6,4) from me this turn.\nCan enemy steal (6,5) next turn?\nIf I am at (6,4), enemy at (8,4).\nEnemy moves to (7,4) (Left).\nI move to (6,5) (Up).\nHeads at (7,4) and (6,5). Safe.\nCan enemy move to (6,5) in 2 turns?\nEnemy (8,4) -> (7,4) -> (6,4) (if I wasn't there).\nBut I will be at (6,4) or (6,5).\nIf I am at (6,5), enemy at (6,4) is possible.\n(6,4) is an empty space after I leave it.\nIf enemy goes to (6,4), it's safe.\nHowever, (6,4) is just an empty space (unless I leave an apple, but I ate it).\nSo enemy eating (6,4) gives nothing.\nEnemy might target (6,5) or (5,6).\n(5,6) is adjacent to (6,5).\nIf I am at (6,5), and enemy is at (7,4), enemy can move to (7,5).\n(7,5) is empty.\nFrom (7,5), enemy can move to (6,5).\nIf we both move to (6,5), we die.\nI need to be careful.\nIf I am at (6,5), I should probably move to (5,5) or (3,5) next to avoid being a target.\n\nLet's compare the safety of the two initial moves.\nIf I go Up to (6,4):\nMy body is (6,3).\nEnemy is at (8,4).\nPossible enemy moves that could threaten me?\nNone immediately. I am safe.\nIf I go Down to (6,2):\nMy body is (6,3).\nEnemy is at (8,4).\nDistance is larger. I am safer from the enemy in the short term.\nBut I am moving towards the corner (0,0) is bottom left, I am at (6,2), so x=6 is center-right, y=2 is lower.\nThe bottom row is y=0.\nIf I go Down, I might get trapped in the bottom right if the enemy comes down, but the enemy is at (8,4), so he is high up.\nActually, the enemy is likely to stay high to get the apples at (9,6), (8,7), etc.\nIf I go Down, I compete for (6,2), (7,2), (4,2), (2,2).\nThese are fewer apples.\nIf I go Up, I compete for (6,4), (6,5), (5,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,6), etc.\nMuch more potential.\n\nIs there any risk in going Up?\nThe only risk is if the enemy moves aggressively towards me.\nBut since we start far apart, and I am taking an apple, I will grow.\nA longer snake is generally safer (more body to block) but also a bigger target.\nHowever, growing is necessary to win.\nAlso, if I don't take the apple, the enemy might eventually come and take it, or it might rot? The prompt doesn't say apples rot. They are static.\nSo I can leave it, but taking it is better because:\n1. It denies the enemy.\n2. It gives me a point.\n3. It extends my body, which helps in future fights.\n\nWait, if I extend my body, I have more moves blocked in the future. But with length 1, any extension is good.\nIf I stay length 1, I can turn sharply. If I grow, I have a tail I must avoid.\nBut the tail usually moves away from the head (unless I eat, then the tail stays).\nActually, in this game, if I eat, I grow by 1 segment. The tail does not move that turn.\nSo if I eat at (6,4), my tail remains at (6,3).\nNext turn, if I move to (6,5), my tail moves to (6,4).\nIf I eat again at (6,5), my tail remains at (6,4).\nSo the tail basically follows the path of the head with a delay.\n\nIf I go Up, I eat (6,4).\nIf I go Down, I eat (6,2).\nLet's look at the board coordinates again.\n(6,4) is surrounded by:\nNorth: (6,5) Apple\nSouth: (6,3) My current body (if I move Up)\nWest: (5,4) Empty\nEast: (7,4) Empty\nNorth-West: (5,5) Empty\nNorth-East: (7,5) Empty\nThis is an open intersection.\n\n(6,2) is surrounded by:\nNorth: (6,3) My body\nSouth: (6,1) Empty\nWest: (5,2) Empty\nEast: (7,2) Apple\nThis is also okay, but (6,2) is closer to the bottom edge (y=0).\nAt y=2, I have 2 steps to the wall.\nAt y=4, I have 4 steps to the wall.\nMore space is usually better.\n\nAlso, consider the apple at (0,9) and (0,8).\nTo reach them from (6,3), I need to go Left 6 steps and Up 6 steps.\nFrom (6,4), I need Left 6, Up 5.\nFrom (6,2), I need Left 6, Up 7.\n(6,4) is closer in Manhattan distance to the top-left cluster.\n(6,4) -> (3,5) is 3 Left, 1 Up.\n(6,2) -> (3,5) is 3 Left, 3 Up.\n(6,4) is definitely better positioned for the dense apple cluster.\n\nIs there any reason to avoid (6,4)?\nThe enemy is at (8,4). They are on the same y-level.\nIf I go to (6,4), and the enemy decides to charge me (e.g. Left, Left, Left), they could reach (5,4) or (6,4) in a few turns.\nHowever, I can easily dodge.\nIf I go Down, the enemy is less likely to chase me because there are fewer apples there.\nBut that means I secure the upper apples.\nIf I go Up, I might enter a conflict zone with the enemy.\nBut the enemy is at (8,4). The apples are at (3,5), (2,5), etc. The \"center\" of the apple cluster is around x=3, y=5.\nI am at x=6. The enemy is at x=8.\nI am closer to the cluster than the enemy is.\nI can race to the cluster.\nIf I go Up, I start the race.\nIf I go Down, I abandon the cluster to the enemy? Maybe, but there are apples down there too.\n\nLet's check the down apples again.\n(6,2), (7,2), (4,2), (2,2). That's 4 apples.\nUpper cluster (rows 4,5,6,7,8,9):\n(6,4), (6,5), (5,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,4), (1,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (2,2) is actually y=2, so lower.\nAlso (9,6), (8,7) are in the top right.\nIf I go Up, I can access the central apples.\nIf I go Down, I access the bottom apples.\nThe upper cluster has more apples.\nAlso, the top row has 3 apples (0,7), (0,8), (0,9) which are very valuable if I can get there safely.\nGetting there requires traversing the board.\nThe path from (6,3) to (0,8) goes through (5,4), (4,5), etc.\nGoing Up to (6,4) puts me on that path.\nGoing Down to (6,2) puts me off that path.\n\nSo, Up is clearly the strategic choice for maximizing apple potential.\n\nLet's double-check immediate safety of Up.\nHead: (6,3) -> (6,4).\nIs (6,4) empty? Yes, it's an apple.\nIs the move valid?\nIf the enemy moves to (6,4)? No, enemy at (8,4) cannot reach (6,4) in one move.\nIf the enemy moves to (6,3)? No, not adjacent.\nIf the enemy moves to (5,4)? (5,4) is adjacent to (6,4). If I move to (6,4) and enemy moves to (5,4), we are adjacent heads. That is allowed. Only same cell is fatal.\nSo, Up is safe.\n\nLet's check Down just to be sure.\nHead: (6,3) -> (6,2).\n(6,2) is empty (apple).\nSafe.\n\nWhy not Left or Right?\nLeft to (5,3): Empty. But no apple. Why move to an empty square when I can move to an apple?\nRight to (7,3): Empty. No apple.\nSo Left and Right are suboptimal compared to Up or Down.\n\nBetween Up and Down, Up leads to a denser apple cluster and a better strategic position (center of board vs lower edge).\n\nOne final check on the enemy.\nEnemy at (8,4). Apples near enemy: (9,6), (8,7), (6,4) (but I'm taking it), (6,5).\nIf I take (6,4), I deny the enemy a potential path.\nIf I leave (6,4), the enemy might move to (7,4) then (6,4).\nIf I am at (6,4), the enemy is blocked from going to (6,4).\nThe enemy might try to go to (6,5) or (5,6).\nIf I am at (6,4), I can move to (6,5) next turn and secure it.\nIf I go Down, I leave the upper board open.\nThe enemy is at (8,4), which is closer to (9,6) and (8,7) than I am.\nLet's calculate distances:\nEnemy (8,4) to (9,6): dx=1, dy=2. Dist ~2.2.\nMe (6,3) to (9,6): dx=3, dy=3. Dist ~4.2.\nSo the enemy has the advantage on the top-right apples.\nMe (6,3) to (3,5): dx=3, dy=2. Dist ~3.6.\nEnemy (8,4) to (3,5): dx=5, dy=1. Dist ~5.1.\nI have the advantage on the central/left apples.\nTherefore, I should focus on the central/left apples.\nUp is the move towards the central/left apples.\n\nIs there any risk of getting trapped?\nIf I go Up to (6,4), my body is at (6,3).\nIf I then go Up to (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3).\nIf I then go Left to (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\nI am creating a \"stem\".\nI need to ensure I don't box myself in.\nLooking at the board, there is plenty of space.\nThe area (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) is clear except for apples.\nThe area (1,6), (0,7) is clear.\nI can make a loop or a snake path.\n\nWhat if I go Down?\nI go to (6,2). Body (6,3).\nThen (7,2). Body (6,2), (6,3).\nThen (7,3). Body (7,2), (6,2), (6,3).\nI am building a structure on the bottom right.\nI can then go to (7,4).\nBut (7,4) is empty.\nFrom (7,4), I can go Up.\nBut then I am climbing up the right side.\nThe right side has fewer apples compared to the left/center.\n(9,6) is there, but enemy is closer.\n(8,7) is there.\n(7,2) is there.\nThe left side has (6,4), (6,5), (5,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,6), (1,4), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9).\nThe left side is much richer.\n\nTherefore, the move Up is the best choice.\n\nPlan for next few turns:\n1. Move UP to (6,4) and eat the apple.\n2. Next turn, likely move UP to (6,5) to eat that apple, creating a vertical line at x=6.\n3. Then move LEFT to (5,5) to position for (3,5) and (2,5).\n4. Watch out for the enemy. If the enemy moves aggressively towards (6,5), I might need to dodge or block.\nBut for now, just securing the apple is key.\n\nFinal check on the rules:\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nI have no body. So no issue.\n\"Your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n(6,4) is empty. Enemy body is at (8,4) (and moving). Safe.\n\"Moving outside the board\"\n(6,4) is inside.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nOne detail: The board display shows \"1\" at (8,4) and \"0\" at (6,3). This represents the heads.\nThe apples are \"A\".\nDots are empty.\nI am moving from (6,3) to (6,4).\nThe coordinate system: (0,0) bottom left. (9,9) top right.\nSo (6,4) is indeed Up from (6,3).\n\nI will write the plan for the next turn as requested.\n\"Long-term plan: Move Up to (6,4) to secure the apple. Then continue Up to (6,5) and Left to (3,5) to collect the central apple cluster. Avoid the enemy who is on the right side.\"\n\nThen output \"UP\".\n\nDouble check if (6,4) is indeed an apple.\nApples list: (1, 4), (6, 5), (5, 6), (2, 5), (4, 2), (3, 5), (1, 6), (0, 8), (2, 2), (9, 6), (8, 7), (6, 4), (0, 7), (7, 2), (0, 9).\nYes, (6, 4) is in the list.\n\nIs there any reason to NOT eat it?\nIf I don't eat it, the enemy might eventually eat it, or I might come back for it later.\nBut eating it now gives me +1 length and +1 score.\nWith length 1, growing is always good.\nIf I stay length 1, I can turn 180 degrees. If I grow to length 2, I cannot turn 180 into my own body (segment 1).\nHowever, I can still move in 3 directions.\nAt (6,4), with body at (6,3), I can go Up (6,5), Left (5,4), Right (7,4). I cannot go Down (6,3).\nThis is still very flexible.\nAt (6,3), with no body, I can go anywhere.\nThe flexibility loss is minimal compared to the gain of an apple.\nAlso, growing makes me harder to kill by head-on collision (if I am longer, I am more likely to have body parts in the way, but actually, for head-on, only heads matter. If I am longer, I am a bigger target for body collision if the enemy moves into me).\nBut the enemy is far away.\n\nOkay, I am confident with Up.\n\nMy plan:\nLong-term plan: Move Up to (6,4) to secure the apple. Then continue Up to (6,5) and Left to (3,5) to collect the central apple cluster. Avoid the enemy who is on the right side.\n\nOutput:\nUP\n\nWait, I need to make sure I don't include the plan in the final output if it's just the word.\nThe prompt says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nI should put the plan before that.\n\nLet's refine the plan slightly.\n\"Plan: Eat the apple at (6,4). Move to (6,5) next turn. Target the cluster at (3,5), (2,5).\"\n\nOkay.\n\nOne edge case: The enemy moves to (7,4) and I move to (6,4). No collision.\nWhat if the enemy moves to (6,4)? Impossible.\nWhat if the enemy moves to (6,3)? Impossible.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves to (5,4)?\n(5,4) is not adjacent to (8,4).\nSo no issue.\n\nAll clear.\n\nFinal check on coordinates.\nX is horizontal (0 to 9).\nY is vertical (0 to 9).\n(6,3) to (6,4) is Y+1.\nY+1 is UP (increasing y coordinate).\nCorrect.\n\nReady.\n\nShort-term plan: Eat the apple at (6,4). Position for the cluster at (6,5) and (3,5). Watch enemy movement.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's look at the board again.\nRow 4: \". A . . . . A . 1 .\"\nMy current head (6,3) is in row 3.\nIf I move Up, I enter row 4 at index 6.\nRow 4 index 6 is 'A'. Correct.\n\nIf I move Down, I enter row 2 at index 6.\nRow 2: \". . A . A . . A . .\"\nIndex 6 is '.' (empty).\nWait, I thought there was an apple at (6,2)?\nApples list: (6, 4) is there. (6, 2) is NOT in the list.\nLet me check the list again.\nApples at: (1, 4), (6, 5), (5, 6), (2, 5), (4, 2), (3, 5), (1, 6), (0, 8), (2, 2), (9, 6), (8, 7), (6, 4), (0, 7), (7, 2), (0, 9).\n(6, 2) is NOT there.\n(7, 2) is there.\n(4, 2) is there.\n(2, 2) is there.\nSo (6, 2) is empty!\nI made a mistake earlier assuming (6,2) was an apple because of the board state representation.\nBoard state row 2: \". . A . A . . A . .\"\nIndices:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: A (x=2, y=2)\n3: .\n4: A (x=4, y=2)\n5: .\n6: . (x=6, y=2)\n7: A (x=7, y=2)\n8: .\n9: .\nSo (6, 2) is empty.\n(7, 2) is an apple.\nIf I go Down to (6, 2), I get NO apple.\nIf I go Right to (7, 3), I get NO apple.\nIf I go Left to (5, 3), I get NO apple.\nIf I go Up to (6, 4), I GET an apple.\n\nThis changes everything!\nI should definitely go Up to eat the apple.\nGoing Down would be a wasted move (no growth, no score).\nGoing Left or Right is also wasted.\nOnly Up gives an immediate reward.\nAnd as established, Up is strategically better.\n\nThis confirms UP is the correct choice.\n\nNow I will write the response.Long-term plan: Move Up to (6,4) to secure the apple and grow. This positions me centrally to access the dense cluster of apples at (6,5), (3,5), and (2,5) in the following turns, while maintaining distance from the enemy on the right side.\n\nUP",

Safe this turn (enemy cannot reach it in one move).\n- RIGHT -> (9,6): contains an apple but is on the board edge (x=9), slightly more constraining.\n- LEFT -> (7,6): moves closer to the enemy's neighborhood; increases risk of contest/boxing.\n- DOWN -> (8,5): open, but gives up an immediate apple.\n\nEnemy move considerations:\n- Enemy cannot move DOWN (would be directly backward into its body).\n- Enemy can move UP (6,6), LEFT (5,5) or RIGHT (7,5). None of those can reach (8,7) this turn, so the apple at (8,7) is uncontested now.\n- A head-on collision is only a real risk if I move toward the enemy's possible next head cells (e.g., into (7,5) area). Staying higher/distanced reduces head-on risk.\n\nChoice reasoning:\n- UP gets an apple immediately and grows me to length 2, while keeping multiple follow-up options (UP/LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN available from the new cell).\n- RIGHT also gets an apple but hugs the right wall and slightly limits future maneuvering.\n- LEFT is unnecessarily aggressive toward the enemy; DOWN forgoes an easy apple.\n\nShort-term plan / notes for next turns:\n- Take (8,7) now. From there prioritize (9,7) or swing left into the central cluster only if the enemy commits elsewhere. Avoid moving into cells the enemy can contest in one turn (especially (7,5)/(7,6) region) to prevent risky head-on fights.

Body = none. Score = 0.\n*   **Board:** 10x10. Coordinates (0,0) to (9,9).\n*   **Apples:** There are 15 apples listed. Looking at the board visualization:\n    *   (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 9) are marked 'A'.\n    *   (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6) are 'A'.\n    *   (5, 6) is 'A'.\n    *   (7, 2), (8, 7), (9, 6), (9, 7) are 'A'.\n    *   The text list includes (1, 4), (5, 6), etc. It matches the board.\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate Immediate Moves for Safety**\nI need to check UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from Head (6, 5).\n\n*   **Coordinates:**\n    *   Up (6, 6): Valid board range. Cell content on board is '.' (empty). Not my body.\n    *   Down (6, 4): Valid board range. Cell content on board is 'T' (Tail). Since my body is [(6, 4), (6, 3)], this is my own tail. Moving into your own body is death (except if the tail moves away? No, rules say \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die\" and \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\". Since my tail is at (6, 4), moving down is moving into my own body. **INVALID**.\n    *   Left (6, 4): Valid. Cell content 'T' (My body). **INVALID**.\n    *   Right (6, 6): Valid. Cell content '.' (Empty).\n\nWait, let's re-read the board visual carefully.\nRow 5 (y=5): `. . A A . . 0 . . .`\nIndices: 0: ., 1: ., 2: A, 3: A, 4: ., 5: ., 6: 0, 7: ., 8: ., 9: .\nMy head is at (6, 5).\n\nLet's check neighbors again:\n*   **Up (6, 6):** Row 6 is `. A . . . A . . 1 A`. Index 6 is '.'. Safe.\n*   **Down (6, 4):** Row 4 is `. A . . . . T . . .`. Index 6 is 'T'. This is my tail. Hitting own tail is death. **Unsafe**.\n*   **Left (6, 4):** (5, 5). Row 5 index 5 is '.'. Wait, is that my body? My body is (6, 4) and (6, 3). (5, 5) is not in my body list. It is empty. **Safe**.\n    *   *Correction:* I misread the board. (6, 4) is `T`. (5, 4) is `.`. (6, 4) is directly below. (5, 4) is left-down? No.\n    *   Head is (6, 5).\n    *   Up: (6, 6). Empty.\n    *   Down: (6, 4). My tail. **Unsafe**.\n    *   Left: (5, 5). Row 5 index 5 is '.' (The dots before the T). **Safe**.\n    *   Right: (7, 5). Row 5 index 7 is '.' (The dot after 0). **Safe**.\n\nSo safe moves are: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Enemy and Strategy**\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (8, 6). Body is none. Score 0.\nThis is a head-to-head battle. The enemy is currently at (8, 6).\nIf I move UP to (6, 6), I am at y=6.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 6), he is safe. If he moves LEFT to (6, 6), we collide.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (8, 7), he eats an apple (8, 7) is 'A'.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 5), he hits... row 5 index 8 is '.' (empty).\n\nLet's look at the apples near me.\nI am at (6, 5).\n*   (5, 6): Apple. Up-Left.\n*   (6, 6): Empty.\n*   (7, 6): Empty.\n*   (2, 5): Apple. Far left.\n*   (3, 5): Apple. Left.\n*   (1, 4), (1, 6): Apples. Far left.\n\nLet's look at apples near the enemy (8, 6).\n*   (9, 6): Apple. Right.\n*   (9, 7): Apple. Up-Right.\n*   (8, 7): Apple. Up.\n*   (7, 2): Apple. Down-Left.\n*   (5, 6): Apple. Up-Left (relative).\n\n**Decision on Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 6):**\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Future: From (6, 6), I can go to (5, 6) (Apple), (6, 7) (Empty), (7, 6) (Empty), (6, 5) (Back, usually bad but possible if others block).\n    *   Threat: Enemy at (8, 6) might move Left to (7, 6). If I go to (6, 6), I am not at (7, 6). Collision is only if we meet at same cell.\n    *   Collision Risk: If I am at (6, 6) and Enemy is at (7, 6), safe. If Enemy is at (6, 6), we die. Enemy moving Left from (8, 6) lands at (7, 6). To land at (6, 6), Enemy would have to be at (7, 6) *now*, but he is at (8, 6).\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (8, 7): He eats apple. We are separated.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 5):**\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Future: From (5, 5), I can go to (5, 6) (Apple), (4, 5), (6, 5) (Back), (5, 4) (Apple? No, (5, 4) is '.'). Wait, row 4 is `. A . . . . T . . .`. (5, 4) is '.'.\n    *   Threat: Enemy at (8, 6) is far.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Future: From (7, 5), I can go to (7, 6) (Empty), (8, 5) (Empty).\n    *   Threat: I am moving closer to the enemy. (7, 5) is only 1 unit away from enemy's potential path.\n\n**Comparing UP vs LEFT:**\n\n*   **Option UP (to 6, 6):**\n    *   Moves me towards apples (5, 6) and potentially (3, 5), (2, 5).\n    *   Keeps me relatively central-left.\n    *   Enemy is at (8, 6). If I go UP, I am at (6, 6). Enemy might go UP to (8, 7) (Apple). If Enemy goes LEFT, he goes to (7, 6).\n    *   If I go UP to (6, 6) and Enemy goes LEFT to (7, 6), we are adjacent. Safe.\n    *   If I go UP to (6, 6) and Enemy goes UP to (8, 7), we are separated.\n\n*   **Option LEFT (to 5, 5):**\n    *   Moves me towards (5, 6) (Apple) and (3, 5) (Apple).\n    *   Moves me away from the enemy.\n    *   From (5, 5), next turn I can easily grab (5, 6).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI need to grow. The enemy has 0 apples. I have 2. I should play safe but efficient.\nThe board has a cluster of apples on the left side (0,7-9, 1, 2, 3 columns).\nThe enemy is on the right side (8,6).\nMoving UP puts me at (6, 6).\nFrom (6, 6), the next turn I can move LEFT to (5, 6) to eat the apple at (5, 6).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 5) now, I can also eat (5, 6) next turn.\nHowever, moving UP first establishes a position on row 6, which is closer to the top-left apples (0,7-9) and the left-side apples (2,5, 3,5).\nIf I move UP to (6, 6):\n1.  I am not moving towards the enemy (who is at 8,6).\n2.  I open up the path to (5, 6).\n3.  I avoid the immediate danger of being pinned if the enemy decides to push from the right.\n\nThe enemy is at (8, 6). If the enemy moves LEFT (to 7, 6), he is approaching.\nIf I am at (6, 6) and he is at (7, 6), I am safe.\nIf I am at (5, 5) and he moves to (7, 6), I am also safe.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (2, 5) and (3, 5).\nIf I go UP to (6, 6), I can go LEFT to (5, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 5).\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 5), I can go UP to (5, 6) -> (4, 6)...\nActually, (5, 5) is one step closer to (3, 5) than (6, 6) is. (Distance from 5,5 to 3,5 is 2. From 6,6 to 3,5 is 3+1=4).\n\nHowever, let's look at the board state again.\nRow 5: `. . A A . . 0 . . .`\nIndices 2 and 3 are apples (2,5) and (3,5).\nMy current head is at (6,5).\nIf I move LEFT to (5,5), I am adjacent to the gap between the apples.\nIf I move UP to (6,6), I am adjacent to (5,6) (which is empty? No, row 6 index 5 is 'A'. Wait, let me check the board).\nRow 6: `. A . . . A . . 1 A`\nIndices: 0: ., 1: A, 2: ., 3: ., 4: ., 5: A, 6: ., 7: ., 8: 1, 9: A.\nSo (5, 6) is an Apple! (Index 5 on row 6).\nAnd (1, 6) is an Apple. (Index 1 on row 6).\n\nOkay, so (5, 6) is an apple.\nIf I move UP to (6, 6), I am next to the apple at (5, 6).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 5), I am next to the apple at (5, 6).\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5), I am moving away from (5, 6) and towards (8, 5) (empty).\n\nSo the best moves are UP or LEFT.\n\nWhy choose UP over LEFT?\n1.  **Safety from Enemy:** The enemy is at (8, 6). If the enemy moves LEFT (to 7, 6), he is approaching.\n    *   If I am at (6, 6), distance to enemy is 1 (if he is at 7, 6).\n    *   If I am at (5, 5), distance to enemy is sqrt((7-5)^2 + (6-5)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = ~2.2.\n    *   Being at (6, 6) puts me on the same row as the enemy's potential approach vector. This might be risky if the enemy wants to trap me.\n    *   However, (6, 6) is safe *this turn*.\n\n2.  **Access to Apples:**\n    *   From (6, 6), I can eat (5, 6) next turn (LEFT).\n    *   From (5, 5), I can eat (5, 6) next turn (UP).\n    *   From (6, 6), I also have access to (3, 5) and (2, 5) via the left side.\n\nLet's reconsider the board.\nThe enemy is at (8, 6). He sees (9, 6) and (9, 7) and (8, 7).\nIf he goes for (9, 6), he moves RIGHT.\nIf he goes for (8, 7), he moves UP.\nIf he goes for (9, 7), he moves UP-RIGHT (impossible in one move). He would have to go RIGHT or UP first.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 5):\nI am moving towards the \"Left Wall\" cluster.\nThis seems safer. If the enemy comes chasing, I can use the wall.\nIf I move UP to (6, 6):\nI am more central. If the enemy comes from the right, I have to move left. I am not cornered.\n\nLet's look at the \"T\" (Tail) positions.\nMy tail is at (6, 3) and (6, 4).\nIf I move UP, my body becomes [(6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)].\nIf I move LEFT, my body becomes [(5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)].\n\nThe apple at (5, 6) is very close.\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 5), I am in the middle of the board vertically (y=5).\nIf I go UP to (6, 6), I am higher (y=6).\n\nLet's check the apples at (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 7).\nThese are top-left corner.\nIf I want to secure those, I need to go UP and LEFT.\n(6, 6) is a better pivot for (0, 8) than (5, 5) is?\n(6, 6) to (0, 8): x-dist 6, y-dist 2.\n(5, 5) to (0, 8): x-dist 5, y-dist 3.\nDistance is similar. (5,5) is slightly closer in Manhattan distance (8 vs 11? No).\nManhattan (6,6)->(0,8) = 6+2 = 8.\nManhattan (5,5)->(0,8) = 5+3 = 8.\n\nSo they are equidistant from the top-left corner.\n\nHowever, (5, 6) is an apple.\nFrom (6, 6), I can go LEFT to (5, 6).\nFrom (5, 5), I can go UP to (5, 6).\nBoth paths allow eating the apple next turn.\n\nIs there a trap?\nMy body is currently (6, 4), (6, 3).\nIf I move UP to (6, 6), my body occupies column 6.\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 5), I start occupying column 5.\nLeaving column 6 open behind me is good if I need to retreat later, but usually, you want to clear space.\nMoving to (5, 5) clears column 6 for future movement.\n\n**Final Decision Logic:**\nThe enemy is at (8, 6).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 6), he is getting closer.\nIf I am at (6, 6), I am right next to him. I am in his direct path.\nIf I am at (5, 5), I am not in his direct path. I am \"above\" and \"left\" of his path.\nIf he moves to (7, 6), and I am at (5, 5), I am safe.\nIf he moves to (7, 6), and I am at (6, 6), I am safe *this turn*, but next turn I might be pressured.\nAlso, (5, 5) is closer to the \"safe zone\" (the left wall) and the apple cluster.\nTherefore, moving LEFT seems slightly more strategic to avoid immediate contact with the enemy and to secure the left-side apples.\n\nWait, let's look at the apple at (5, 6) again.\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 5), I am adjacent to (5, 6).\nIf I move UP to (6, 6), I am adjacent to (5, 6).\nActually, from (6, 6), I can reach (5, 6) in 1 move.\nFrom (5, 5), I can reach (5, 6) in 1 move.\n\nIs there any difference in safety *next* turn?\nIf I am at (6, 6):\nI can go LEFT (5, 6), DOWN (6, 5), RIGHT (7, 6), UP (6, 7).\nDOWN goes back to previous head. usually bad unless blocked.\nRIGHT goes towards enemy.\nUP goes to (6, 7).\nLEFT goes to apple.\n\nIf I am at (5, 5):\nI can go LEFT (4, 5), DOWN (5, 4), RIGHT (6, 5), UP (5, 6).\nDOWN (5, 4) is empty (Row 4 index 5 is '.').\nRIGHT (6, 5) is previous head.\nUP (5, 6) is apple.\nLEFT (4, 5) is empty.\n\nBoth positions offer an apple next turn.\nHowever, (5, 5) seems more flexible. From (5, 5), I can go DOWN to (5, 4) which is relatively empty (Row 4 has apples at 1 and 2, but 5 is empty).\nFrom (6, 6), going DOWN is backtracking (bad).\nFrom (6, 6), going RIGHT is dangerous (towards enemy).\nFrom (6, 6), going UP is (6, 7). What is at (6, 7)? Row 7 index 6 is 'A' (Apple at 7,2? No. Row 7 is `. . . . . . . A A`. Index 6 is '.'? Wait. Row 7: `. . . . . . . A A`. Indices 0-6 are '.', 7 is 'A', 8 is 'A'. So (6, 7) is empty.\nSo (6, 6) -> UP (6, 7) is empty.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 6: `. A . . . A . . 1 A`\nRow 7: `. . . . . . . A A`\nRow 8: `A . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 9: `A . . . . . . . . .`\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 6):\nI am at (6, 6).\nNext turn, I can go UP to (6, 7). Empty.\nOr LEFT to (5, 6). Apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 5):\nI am at (5, 5).\nNext turn, I can go UP to (5, 6). Apple.\nOr DOWN to (5, 4). Empty (Row 4 index 5 is '.').\nOr LEFT to (4, 5). Empty (Row 5 index 4 is '.').\n\nThe difference is subtle.\n(6, 6) is more \"central\".\n(5, 5) is slightly \"offset\".\n\nLet's consider the enemy's move.\nThe enemy is at (8, 6).\nApples near enemy: (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7).\nIf the enemy is smart, he will grab (9, 6) or (8, 7).\nIf he grabs (9, 6), he moves RIGHT.\nIf he grabs (8, 7), he moves UP.\nIf he moves UP to (8, 7), he is at (8, 7).\nIf I am at (6, 6), distance is 2.\nIf I am at (5, 5), distance is 3.\n\nThe enemy is currently at (8, 6).\nIf he moves RIGHT to (9, 6) (Apple), he is further away from me.\nIf he moves UP to (8, 7) (Apple), he is closer vertically but same x-distance.\nIf he moves LEFT to (7, 6), he is closing the gap aggressively.\nIf he moves LEFT, he is likely trying to pressure me.\n\nIf he moves LEFT to (7, 6):\nAnd I move UP to (6, 6):\nWe are neighbors. (7, 6) and (6, 6).\nIf I am at (6, 6) and he is at (7, 6), I am safe for this turn.\nBut next turn, if I move LEFT to (5, 6) (Apple), and he moves LEFT to (6, 6) (Empty), we collide? No, I would be at (5, 6). He would be at (6, 6). Safe.\nIf he moves LEFT to (6, 6) and I am at (6, 6) *now*, I am leaving (6, 6) to go to (5, 6). He arrives at (6, 6). Safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 5):\nAnd he moves LEFT to (7, 6):\nWe are far apart.\n\n**The Real Question:**\nIs (5, 6) safe to eat next turn?\nIf I am at (6, 6) and go LEFT to (5, 6), can the enemy be there?\nThe enemy is at (8, 6). He would need to move LEFT twice to get to (5, 6). Impossible in one turn.\nIf I am at (5, 5) and go UP to (5, 6), same logic.\n\n**Why LEFT to (5, 5) might be better:**\nIt clears column 6.\nIt moves me slightly away from the enemy's direct horizontal approach vector.\nIt puts me in a position to potentially drop down to row 4 (which is safer) or go up to row 6.\n\n**Why UP to (6, 6) might be better:**\nIt gets me to row 6, which has an apple at (5, 6) and (1, 6).\nIt stays on row 5 only if I move LEFT.\nRow 6 has more apples visible (1,6 and 5,6) than row 5 (2,5 and 3,5).\nRow 6 seems more valuable.\n\nLet's check Row 6 apples: (1, 6), (5, 6).\nLet's check Row 5 apples: (2, 5), (3, 5).\nTo get to (1, 6), I need to be at y=6.\nTo get to (2, 5), I can be at y=5.\n\nIf I go UP to (6, 6), I am on the row with two apples.\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 5), I am on a row with no apples (Row 5 has apples at 2 and 3, I am at 5).\n\n**Correction on Row 5 apples:**\nRow 5: `. . A A . . 0 . . .`\nApples at (2, 5) and (3, 5).\nIf I am at (5, 5), I am far from them (x=2,3 vs x=5).\nTo reach them from (5, 5), I need to go LEFT 2 or 3 times.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP to (6, 6) places me on a row with apples (5, 6) and (1, 6).\nMoving LEFT to (5, 5) places me on a row with apples at (2, 5) and (3, 5), but I am far to the right on that row.\nTherefore, UP is better for apple proximity.\nAlso, from (6, 6), I can access the top-left corner apples (0,7, 0,8, 0,9) via (1,6) or (5,6).\nFrom (5, 5), I have to go up to y=6 anyway to get those top apples.\n\nSo, UP seems to align better with the apple density.\n\nLet's double check safety of UP.\nHead (6, 5) -> UP -> (6, 6).\nIs (6, 6) empty? Yes (Row 6 index 6 is '.').\nIs (6, 6) my body? No.\nIs (6, 6) enemy body? Enemy body is empty.\nIs (6, 6) enemy head? Enemy head is (8, 6). No.\nIs (6, 6) off board? No.\n\nIs (6, 6) a collision risk?\nIf enemy moves to (6, 6), we die. Enemy is at (8, 6). He moves 1 step.\nTo reach (6, 6), he would need to move 2 steps left. Impossible.\nSo (6, 6) is safe from head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMove UP to (6, 6).\nNext turn, likely move LEFT to (5, 6) to eat the apple.\nThis gives me 3 apples. Score 3.\nThen I can continue to the left (4,6) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) or (2,5).\nOr go for (1, 6).\n\nThe enemy is at (8, 6). If he wants to be aggressive, he might move LEFT to (7, 6).\nIf he moves to (7, 6), I am at (6, 6).\nIf I eat the apple at (5, 6) next turn, I am at (5, 6).\nHe would be at (7, 6) or (6, 6).\nIf he is at (6, 6) and I am at (5, 6), safe.\nIf he is at (7, 6) and I am at (5, 6), safe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves UP to (8, 7) (Apple)?\nHe gets an apple. He is at (8, 7).\nI am at (6, 6).\nDistance is large.\nThis is fine. I secure my own growth.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 6) (Apple)?\nHe gets an apple. He is at (9, 6).\nI am at (6, 6).\nSafe.\n\nSo UP is safe and positions me well.\n\nOne final check. Is there any reason to fear (6, 6)?\nRow 6: `. A . . . A . . 1 A`\n(6, 6) is empty.\nThe cell (7, 6) is empty.\nThe cell (5, 6) is Apple.\nThe cell (6, 7) is empty.\nThe cell (6, 5) is my old body (will be empty next turn except for tail).\nThe cell (6, 4) is my tail.\n\nIf I move UP, my tail moves from (6, 3) to... wait, my body is [(6, 4), (6, 3)].\nHead (6, 5).\nIf I move UP to (6, 6):\nNew Head: (6, 6)\nNew Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4)]\nNew Tail: (6, 4) (was previously (6, 3), but the last segment (6, 3) is removed unless I eat).\nWait, I didn't eat an apple this turn.\nSo my length remains 3.\nNew Body: [(6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)].\nThe cell (6, 3) becomes empty.\nThis is standard movement.\n\nIs there any risk of trapping myself?\nFrom (6, 6), I have neighbors:\n(6, 7) - Empty\n(5, 6) - Apple\n(7, 6) - Empty\n(6, 5) - My body (next turn)\nSo I have 3 free directions (Up, Left, Right). Right is towards enemy, but still free.\nThis is not a trap.\n\nIf I moved LEFT to (5, 5):\nNeighbors:\n(5, 6) - Apple\n(4, 5) - Empty\n(6, 5) - My body (next turn)\n(5, 4) - Empty\n4 free directions.\nAlso not a trap.\n\nOkay, both are safe.\nWhy UP?\n1.  Apple at (5, 6) is accessible.\n2.  Apple at (1, 6) is accessible.\n3.  Aligns with row 6 which has more apples than row 5.\n4.  Keeps me away from the left wall initially, giving me more maneuvering room.\n5.  Moving UP keeps the option open to go LEFT or RIGHT.\n    If I go LEFT now to (5, 5), I can't go RIGHT (back to 6,5).\n    If I go UP to (6, 6), I can go LEFT (5, 6), RIGHT (7, 6), or UP (6, 7).\n    UP offers more flexibility for the *next* turn.\n\nWait, if I go UP to (6, 6), I can go RIGHT to (7, 6).\nIs (7, 6) safe?\n(7, 6) is empty.\nBut (8, 6) is the enemy.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 6), and I move RIGHT to (7, 6), we collide and die.\nSo moving RIGHT is dangerous if I suspect the enemy will move LEFT.\nBut if the enemy moves UP to (8, 7) or RIGHT to (9, 6), then (7, 6) is empty and safe.\nSo having the option to go RIGHT is good *if* the enemy doesn't move left.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 5), I cannot go RIGHT.\nSo if the enemy moves UP/RIGHT, and I am at (6, 6), I could have moved RIGHT to (7, 6) to maybe flank or get closer to apples on the right (though right side has fewer apples it seems, mostly top right).\nWait, (7, 2) is an apple.\n(9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7) are apples on the right.\nBut the enemy is there. It's contested.\nThe left side (0,7-9, 1, 2, 3 columns) seems safer and richer.\nSo I should prioritize LEFT side.\n\nIf I prioritize LEFT side, moving UP to (6, 6) allows me to go LEFT to (5, 6).\nMoving LEFT to (5, 5) allows me to go UP to (5, 6).\nBoth get me to the apple.\nBut (6, 6) is higher up. It's closer to (0, 9).\n(5, 5) is lower.\nI want to be higher (y=6 or y=7) to access the top row apples (0, 8, 0, 9).\nSo UP is the correct direction to gain altitude for the top-left corner.\n\nFinal check on coordinates.\n(6, 6) is row 6.\n(5, 5) is row 5.\nRow 6 is higher.\nApples at (0, 8) (0, 9) are high.\nApples at (1, 6) is at y=6.\nApples at (0, 7) is at y=7.\nSo moving to y=6 (UP) gets me closer to y=7 and y=8.\nMoving to y=5 (LEFT) keeps me at y=5.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nPlan for next turn: Eat (5, 6) if safe, else (1, 6) or clear path to top-left.\n\nShort-term plan:\nMove UP to (6, 6) to gain altitude and approach the cluster of apples on the left side (specifically aiming for (5, 6) next turn). Avoid the enemy by maintaining distance.\n\nFinal move: UP.\n\nOne last check. Is there any reason the enemy might move to (6, 6)?\nNo, he is at (8, 6). He can't reach (6, 6) in one move.\nIs there any reason I might die moving UP?\nNo.\n\nOkay.\n\nWait, I should verify the \"directly backwards\" rule.\nMy head is at (6, 5).\nMy body connects to (6, 4).\nDirectly backwards is (6, 4) (DOWN).\nMoving UP is not backwards. Safe.\n\nI am confident in UP.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (6, 6). Prepare to move LEFT to (5, 6) next turn to eat the apple. This secures growth and positions me to access the top-left apple cluster (0,7-9) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake on the right side.\n\nMove: UP.UP",

Score 2.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head at (7, 7). Body at [(7, 6), (7, 5)]. Score 3.\n    *   *Note:* The enemy snake has moved since the last turn (previous head was 8,6). He is now at (7, 7) and has grown.\n*   **Apples:** Many apples are present, including (5, 6), (2, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9) on the left/top, and (9, 6), (9, 7) on the right.\n\n**Evaluation of Moves from Head (6, 6):**\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):**\n    *   Board state at (6, 7) is '.' (empty).\n    *   Enemy head is at (7, 7). Enemy body is at (7, 6) and (7, 5).\n    *   Collision risk: If Enemy moves LEFT to (6, 7), we collide head-on. This is a high probability move for the enemy, as they are currently at (7, 7) and might see (6, 7) or want to head towards the top-left apples.\n    *   Growth: (6, 7) is empty. No immediate apple.\n    *   Outcome: **High Risk**.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):**\n    *   My body is at (6, 5) and (6, 4).\n    *   Moving DOWN moves my head into my own body segment at (6, 5).\n    *   Outcome: **Death**. Invalid move.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):**\n    *   Board state at (5, 6) is 'A' (Apple).\n    *   Enemy is at (7, 7). Enemy body is (7, 6), (7, 5).\n    *   Is (5, 6) reachable by the enemy? Enemy is at (7, 7). To reach (5, 6) in one turn, they would need to move 2 units (Left-Down), which is impossible. The closest they can get is (6, 6) (Left) or (6, 7) (Up-Left), but diagonal movement isn't allowed.\n    *   Is (5, 6) safe from the enemy's body? Enemy body is at x=7. (5, 6) is at x=5. Safe.\n    *   Outcome: **Safe and Growth**. I eat an apple, gaining +1 score and +1 length.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n    *   Board state at (7, 6) is 'T' (Enemy body segment).\n    *   Moving here kills me.\n    *   Outcome: **Death**. Invalid move.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (5, 6) is the only move that guarantees survival and immediate growth. It moves me away from the enemy (who is at x=7) and towards the dense cluster of apples on the left side of the board (0,7-9, 1, 6, etc.). While UP could be safe if the enemy moves away, it is a gamble that risks a head-on collision. LEFT provides a guaranteed point and maintains a safe distance.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (5, 6) immediately. From (5, 6), I will have access to apples at (1, 6) or the top-left corner (0, 7-9). I will continue to move left/up to clear the board of apples while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake. Since the enemy is currently focused on the right side, securing the left side is the safest winning strategy.\n\nLEFT",

Good mobility and stays off the right wall.\n- LEFT -> (7,7): empty, moves toward the board center and closer to the enemy\u2019s general area (increases contest risk).\n- RIGHT -> (9,7): apple present, gives an immediate point and growth but hugs the right wall and reduces escape options (cannot go further right next turn).\n\nEnemy (head 6,6; body 6,5 & 6,4) cannot move DOWN (into its own body). Their immediate options are (6,7), (5,6), (7,6). None can contest apples at (9,7)/(9,6) this turn, so RIGHT is safe this turn but a bit risky strategically (edges + enabling proximity to enemy moving toward our tail).\n\nDecision:\nAvoid DOWN (death). RIGHT yields an apple now but pushes me to the right edge and could let the enemy approach my tail area next turns. LEFT moves toward the enemy and increases head-on/boxing risk. UP gives the most maneuverability, keeps distance from the enemy, and preserves options to go after the right-side apples later on safer terms.\n\nShort-term plan:\nTake a conservative move to maintain space (UP). Next turns, reassess enemy\u2019s movement; if the enemy commits away from the right edge, consider taking (9,7) then (9,6).

There is no way the enemy can reach (4, 6) in one turn (distance is 4). Even in two turns, it's difficult for them to block me.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5, 5):\nThis moves me towards (4, 2) and (2, 2) and (3, 3).\nHowever, my body is currently blocking the row y=6 and y=5 at x=6.\n(5, 5) is close to my body at (6, 5).\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving away from the top-left apples (0, 7-9) which are the closest high-value targets.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **UP**: Isolates me in the middle. Loses connection to left side apples.\n- **DOWN**: Moves me to y=5. Access to (3, 5), (2, 2), (4, 2).\n- **LEFT**: Moves me to x=4. Access to (0, 7-9), (1, 6).\n\nThe apples at (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 6) are all on the left/top. Moving LEFT puts me in the best position to harvest this cluster while keeping a safe distance from the enemy on the right.\n\nIs (4, 6) safe?\n- Board state (4, 6) is '.'.\n- Enemy (8, 8) cannot reach (4, 6).\n- My body is at (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4). (4, 6) is not adjacent to my body (except (5, 6) which is my head, and (6, 6) which is my neck).

No collision with enemy (which is far away).\n    *   **Apple:** The apple at (1, 6) is visible in the list. (3, 6) is one step closer.\n    *   **Future:** (3, 6) connects to (2, 6) and (3, 7)/ (3, 5).

(4, 7) aligns horizontally.\n    *   **Future:** Keeps me in the upper-left region.\n\n3.  **DOWN (4, 5):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (4, 5).\n    *   **Board State:** The board snippet shows `(4, 5)` as `A` (Apple). (Row 5, Col 4 is an apple).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. My body is at (5,6) and (6,6). (4, 5) is not occupied by me.\n    *   **Gain:** Eating an apple immediately increases my score to 4.\n    *   **Future:** Eating the apple allows me to grow. From (4, 5), I can access (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 5).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 6):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (5, 6).\n    *   **Safety:** **DEAD**. (5, 6) is currently occupied by my body (the segment immediately behind my head).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **RIGHT** is death.\n- **LEFT** is safe and moves toward the apple at (1, 6).\n- **UP** is safe and moves toward the apple at (0, 7).\n- **DOWN** is safe and **EATS** an apple immediately at (4, 5).\n\n**Decision:**\nEating an apple is a primary objective. The move **DOWN** to (4, 5) consumes an apple and is safe. It also moves me slightly away from the dense wall of my own body on the right (columns 5 and 6 are occupied by my body), which is generally a good move for safety. While LEFT and UP are viable, DOWN offers an immediate reward without immediate risk.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (4, 5) to eat the apple. After eating, I will likely need to turn LEFT or DOWN again to continue navigating the bottom-left quadrant and avoid getting trapped by my own growing body.\n\nDOWN",

This implies I successfully moved DOWN from (4, 6) to (4, 5) in the previous turn, eating the apple. My current score is 3 apples.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 6):**\n- **My Head:** (4, 5)\n- **My Body:** [(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)]\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (7, 9), Body [(7, 8), (8, 8)] (Length 3).\n- **Apples:** Multiple apples exist, including (3, 5) directly to my LEFT, (2, 5) further LEFT, and (4, 2) directly BELOW.\n\n**Move Evaluation from (4, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 6):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (4, 6).\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY**.

No collision with my body (occupying 4,6 / 5,6 / 6,6) or enemy (at 7,9 / 7,8 / 8,8).\n    *   **Apple:** No apple immediately. However, an apple exists at (4, 2) two steps below.\n    *   **Future:** Moves me toward the bottom-left quadrant. Opens up (3, 4) and (5, 4) for next turn.\n\n3.  **LEFT (3, 5):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (3, 5).\n    *   **Board State:** **APPLE (A)**. (Row 5, Col 3 is `A`).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. My body is to the right (x >= 4). Enemy is far right (x >= 7).\n    *   **Gain:** Eating this apple is immediate and safe.\n    *   **Future:** From (3, 5), I can continue LEFT to (2, 5) (another apple), UP to (3, 6), or DOWN to (3, 4).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 5):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (5, 5).\n    *   **Board State:** **APPLE (A)**. (Row 5, Col 5 is `A`).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. My body is at (4, 6) and (5, 6), so (5, 5) is empty.\n    *   **Gain:** Immediate apple.\n    *   **Future:** From (5, 5), I can go RIGHT to (6, 5) (currently empty, but close to body at 6,6), DOWN to (5, 4), or UP to (5, 6) (DEADLY).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **UP** is death.\n- **LEFT** moves toward the dense apple cluster on the left ((3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 6)) and keeps me away from the enemy on the right. It is safe and offers immediate reward plus clear future path.\n- **RIGHT** moves toward (5, 5) (apple) but positions my head near my own body at (6, 6) and (5, 6), limiting future movement options (e.g., UP is blocked). It also moves me closer to the enemy's territory on the right side.\n- **DOWN** is safe but less immediately rewarding than LEFT or RIGHT. It moves toward the bottom wall, potentially limiting vertical escape routes later.\n\n**Decision:**\n**LEFT** is the optimal move. It secures an apple immediately at (3, 5) and positions the head at the entrance of the apple-rich left side of the board. It maintains maximum distance from the enemy snake (Head at 7,9) and avoids the trap of moving right into the \"corner\" of my own body.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving to (3, 5) and growing (length becomes 4), I will likely be at (3, 5) with body [(4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]. If the apple at (2, 5) remains, I should move LEFT again. If not, I will look for apples at (1, 6) or (3, 6). I must avoid moving UP into (3, 6) if my body is still blocking the exit at (4, 6), though by then the tail will have moved.\n\nLEFT",

The game state provided shows \"Apples collected: 4\".\n    *   **Note on Board State:** The visual board shows my head at `(4, 5)` (marked as `0 T`), but the textual list clearly states the snake is at `Head: (3, 5)`. I must trust the text description and the fact that I just ate the apple at (3, 5).\n\n2.  **Enemy Snake #1:**\n    *   **Head:** (6, 9)\n    *   **Body:** [(7, 9), (7, 8)]\n    *   **Status:** Occupies the top-right corner.

Immediate score increase.\n        *   **Future:** From (2, 5), I can go to (1, 5) (Empty), (2, 4) (Empty), or (2, 6) (Apple). This is a very strong directional cluster.\n\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 5):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (4, 5).\n        *   **Board State:** The visual board shows `T` (Tail) at (4, 5) (Row 5, Col 4). This corresponds to my body segment listed in the state.\n        *   **Safety:** **DEADLY**. Moving into my own body segment is immediate death. Even if the tail moves next turn, the head cannot move into a cell occupied by the body at the start of the turn.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI must avoid **RIGHT** at all costs. Between **UP**, **DOWN**, and **LEFT**, **LEFT** is the superior choice.\n\n*   **LEFT** guarantees an immediate apple at (2, 5), increasing my score to 5.\n*   **LEFT** positions my head at (2, 5), which is adjacent to another apple at (2, 6) and an empty space at (1, 5).\n*   Moving **LEFT** keeps me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy snake on the right.\n*   Moving UP or DOWN moves me into empty space without scoring immediately, which is less efficient.\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (2, 5) and eating the apple, my body will extend to [(3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)]. On the next turn, I will likely have the option to move to (2, 6) (Apple) or (1, 5) (Empty).

Monitor enemy movement; if they approach the top or attempt to cut me off, drop down around x=5\u20136 into open central area to pursue central apples and avoid head-on collisions.

They are too far to contest any immediate head-to-head on the top row this turn. No opponent body occupies (4,9) or (5,8).

This is a significant development. The enemy is now closer to the center-left area where the apple cluster is. He is approaching from the top-right. Distance is closing.\n\n3.  **Apple Clustering:**\n    *   The immediate cluster remains strong.\n    *   At (1, 6) (Apple) - Left of current head.\n    *   At (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7) - High value targets but require traversing through the top-left corner.\n    *   At (1, 4) and (2, 2) - Lower value targets to the bottom-left.\n\n4.  **Move Evaluation from (2, 6):**\n    *   **UP (2, 7):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (2, 7).\n        *   **Board State:** Empty (`.`).\n        *   **Safety:** **SAFE**. My body is at y=5 and x=3,4,5,6.\n        *   **Gain:** No apple.\n        *   **Future:** Opens up (2, 8) or (1, 7). Moves away from the immediate cluster at (1, 6). Not ideal for scoring.\n    \n    *   **DOWN (2, 5):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (2, 5).\n        *   **Board State:** My body (`T`).\n        *   **Safety:** **DEADLY**.

My body is at x=2,3,4,5,6. The enemy is at y=8, not a threat this turn.\n        *   **Gain:** **APPLE**. Immediate score increase to 7.\n        *   **Future:** From (1, 6), I can move to (0, 6) (Empty), (2, 6) (Empty as I just left it), or (1, 7) (Empty). It also positions me to easily target (1, 9) or (0, 7) next.\n\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 6):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (3, 6).\n        *   **Board State:** Empty (`.`).\n        *   **Safety:** **SAFE**. My body is at x=2,4,5,6.\n        *   **Gain:** No apple.\n        *   **Future:** Leads to (4, 6) which is my body (deadly), or (3, 5) which is my body (deadly). Moving RIGHT traps me immediately. I would be forced to go UP (3, 7) or DOWN (3, 5 -> death). Actually, (3, 5) is `T` (Body). (4, 6) is `T` (Body). The only open path is UP to (3, 7). This is a \"dead end\" logic flow. If I move Right, I create a loop where I am trapped by my own body on the next turn unless I go UP. It restricts my options significantly. Avoid.\n\n5.  **Decision Logic:**\n    *   **DOWN** is fatal. Eliminated.\n    *   **RIGHT** is safe this turn but creates a trap for the next turn, limiting future options. Highly undesirable.\n    *   **UP** is safe but delays scoring and moves away from the cluster.\n    *   **LEFT** to (1, 6) scores an apple immediately, growing my snake. It keeps me in the high-density apple area. It avoids the trap of moving Right.\n    *   **Head-on Collision Risk:** The enemy is at (5, 8). If he moves LEFT (4, 8) or DOWN (5, 7), he is nowhere near (1, 6). I am safe from head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (1, 6), I will have eaten the apple and grown. My head will be at (1, 6). The enemy is at (5, 8) moving generally towards the center. I need to secure the left-side apples (0,7), (0,8), (0,9) before the enemy cuts me off or reaches them. From (1, 6), I can move UP to (1, 7) or UP-Left to (0, 7). I must be careful not to get trapped in the corner by my own body.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMove **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

That reduces safe follow-up options (down is blocked) and risks getting squeezed if the enemy advances toward the center. It gives me fewer escape choices next turn.\n- LEFT to (4,8) is safe and keeps access to some apples on the left/top, but many of those top-left apples (e.g., (1,9),(0,9),(0,8)) are closer to the enemy (snake #0) \u2014 they can contest that region more easily. Moving left also edges me toward the top where I could get boxed.\n- RIGHT to (6,8) is safe, keeps open space to the east (6,7),(7,8),(7,7)\u2026 and gives access to relatively uncontested apples on the right side (e.g., the (9,5/6/7) cluster). It preserves more escape options than DOWN and avoids getting funneled against the enemy\u2019s body.\n\nChoice rationale:\n- I prefer to avoid immediate adjacency to the enemy body and preserve as many safe follow-ups as possible. Going RIGHT moves me away from the enemy cluster and toward an open region with apples that the enemy is less likely to contest quickly. It keeps 3 good follow-up directions, whereas DOWN would reduce my liberty.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move east to reach the open right-side space and contest apples around x=7\u20139 while watching the enemy\u2019s movements.\n- Avoid getting pushed toward edges; keep at least two escape directions whenever possible.\n- If the enemy commits to the left/top, sweep the right-center apples (4,4 then eastern cluster) while leaving an escape route.\n\nRIGHT",

Is it safe?\n        *   My body: (1, 6) is my current head (will move), (2, 6) is adjacent. (1, 5) is not currently occupied by my body.\n        *   However, (1, 5) is adjacent to the board corner (0, 5) and the bottom wall (y=0). Let's look at the full board map.\n        *   Wait, I need to be careful. Let's look at the map provided in the prompt.\n        *   Row 6 (y=6): `. 0 T . T T . . . A` -> This was the *previous* state? No, the board in the prompt is the current state *before* my move? Actually, the prompt says \"Turn: 10 / 150\". The board usually reflects the state at the start of the turn. But the \"Last Move\" section says I *just* moved to (1, 6).\n        *   Let's trust the \"Last Move\" logic. I am at (1, 6). The board map provided in the prompt text:\n            ```\n            9 A A . . . T . . . .\n            8 A . . . . T 1 . . .\n            7 A . . . . . . . . A\n            6 . 0 T . T T . . .

No, standard 10x10 board parsing.\n            Row 6: Index 0 is empty, Index 1 is '0', Index 2 is 'T'...\n            ```\n            Actually, looking at the map provided in the prompt:\n            ```\n            9 A A . . . T . . . .\n            8 A . . . . T 1 . . .\n            7 A . . . . . . . . A\n            6 . 0 T . T T . . . A\n            ...\n            ```\n            This map shows `(1, 6)` as `0` (My head). This implies the map is *not* updated for my move in the \"Last Move\" section? Or the map is slightly behind?\n            *Correction:* The prompt says \"Turn: 10 / 150\". The board state is usually the start of the turn. However, the \"Last Move\" section says I *selected* LEFT and moved to (1, 6).\n            If the board says `6 . 0 T . T T . . . A`, that means at (1,6) there is a '0'. That corresponds to my previous position (2,6) being `T` and (1,6) being `0`? No, `6 . 0 T` means index 0: `.`, index 1: `0`, index 2: `T`.\n            Let's re-read the coordinates. (1, 6) is x=1, y=6. In the map, row 6 (y=6) is: `. 0 T . T T . . . A`.\n            Index 1 is `0`. This confirms my head is currently at (1, 6) on the map. The apple I just ate is gone from the map (replaced by my head).\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating Moves from (1, 6):**\n        *   **UP (1, 7):**\n            *   Board shows (1, 7) is `.` (Row 7: `A . . . . . . . .

Yes.\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   My goal is to maximize apples and survival.\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #1 is at (6, 8). They are on the right side. I am on the left side.\n    *   **Apple Location:** There is a cluster of apples at the top left: (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (1, 9).\n    *   **Current Position:** (1, 6).\n    *   **Option UP (1, 7):**\n        *   Moves towards the top-left cluster.\n        *   Opens up (1, 8), (1, 9), (0, 7), etc.\n        *   (1, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Option LEFT (0, 6):**\n        *   Moves to the left wall.\n        *   Allows movement to (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9).\n        *   (0, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Option DOWN (1, 5):**\n        *   Moves away from the top-left cluster.\n        *   Leads to (1, 4) (Apple), (1, 3), etc.\n        *   However, looking at the map, (1, 5) leads to a region that might be risky long term if I extend down, but (1, 4) is an apple. (1, 5) is empty.\n\n    *   **Comparing Top-Left (UP/LEFT) vs Bottom-Left (DOWN):**\n        *   The top-left cluster has 4 apples ((0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9)). The bottom-left has apples at (1,4), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4).\n        *   I am currently at (1, 6). The top-left cluster is very close.\n        *   If I go UP to (1, 7), I am at (1, 7). From there I can go LEFT to (0, 7) (Apple), UP to (1, 8), or UP to (1, 9) (Apple).\n        *   If I go LEFT to (0, 6), I can go UP to (0, 7) (Apple) or UP to (0, 8) (Apple).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (1, 5), I can go DOWN to (1, 4) (Apple).\n\n    *   **Safety of Top-Left:**\n        *   The top-left is a corner. Corners can be traps.\n        *   However, I have 7 body segments (after eating). I am quite long.\n        *   Moving UP to (1, 7) keeps me one step away from the wall (x=0).\n        *   Moving LEFT to (0, 6) puts me on the wall.\n        *   Being on the wall limits movement to only 3 directions (Up, Down, Right).\n        *   Being one step off the wall (x=1) allows 4 directions (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n        *   **Therefore, (1, 7) is safer than (0, 6).** It provides more escape routes.\n\n    *   **Why not DOWN?**\n        *   Down leads to (1, 4).\n        *   (1, 4) is an apple.\n        *   However, the area below (1, 4) is (1, 3), (1, 2). (1, 2) is empty. (1, 1) is empty. (1, 0) is empty.\n        *   The bottom-left is more open.\n        *   BUT, the enemy is on the right. The top-left apples are \"contested\" less immediately because they are far from the enemy.\n        *   If I go DOWN, I might end up extending my tail into the center, potentially blocking myself if the enemy approaches.\n        *   The top-left cluster is safer from the enemy. The enemy (6, 8) would have to traverse the whole board to get there.\n\n    *   **Verifying Safety of UP (1, 7):**\n        *   My body: (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6).\n        *   (1, 7) is far from my body.\n        *   Enemy: (6, 8). Distance is huge.\n        *   Walls: (1, 7) is far from walls.\n\n    *   **Verifying Safety of DOWN (1, 5):**\n        *   (1, 5) is empty.\n        *   Also safe.\n        *   However, (1, 5) is closer to my body. (2, 5) is body. (1, 6) is current head (will be body next turn).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (1, 5), next turn I have:\n            *   Up (1, 6) -> Body (will be there)\n            *   Down (1, 4) -> Apple\n            *   Left (0, 5) -> Empty\n            *   Right (2, 5) -> Body\n            *   So I have 3 options. (Up is useless).\n            *   If I go UP to (1, 7):\n            *   Up (1, 8) -> Empty\n            *   Down (1, 6) -> Body\n            *   Left (0, 7) -> Apple\n            *   Right (2, 6) -> Body\n            *   I have 2 useful options (Up, Left).\n            *   If I go LEFT to (0, 6):\n            *   Up (0, 7) -> Apple\n            *   Down (0, 5) -> Empty\n            *   Right (1, 6) -> Body\n            *   I have 2 useful options (Up, Down).\n            *   **Comparison:** UP (1, 7) gives access to (0, 7) and (1, 8). DOWN (1, 5) gives access to (1, 4) and (0, 5).\n            *   The top-left cluster is denser in apples (4 apples) vs bottom-left (fewer apples spread out).\n            *   **Decision:** Commit to the top-left cluster. It is safer from the enemy and dense.\n\n    *   **Is LEFT (0, 6) better than UP (1, 7)?**\n        *   (0, 6) is on the wall. Wall corners are dangerous if trapped.\n        *   (1, 7) is open.\n        *   (0, 6) can access (0, 7) (Apple).\n        *   (1, 7) can access (0, 7) (Apple) and (1, 8).\n        *   (1, 7) is strictly better because it doesn't corner me yet.\n\n    *   **Final Check:**\n        *   Move UP to (1, 7).\n        *   Is there an apple? No, the apple at (1, 7) on the previous board was a ghost. Looking at the apple list: `(1, 4), (4, 2), (0, 8), (2, 2), (9, 6), (0, 7), (7, 2), (0, 9), (9, 7), (3, 3), (1, 9), (9, 5), (7, 1), (4, 4), (4, 1)`.\n        *   Wait, the board map shows `A` at (1, 7)? No.\n        *   Row 7: `A . . . . . . . . A`\n        *   Index 1 is `.`.\n        *   So (1, 7) is empty.\n        *   The apple list includes `(1, 9)`, `(0, 9)`, `(0, 8)`, `(0, 7)`.\n        *   Moving UP to (1, 7) puts me in position to eat (0, 7) or (1, 9) next.\n\n    *   **Safety Check against Enemy:**\n        *   Enemy (6, 8).\n        *   If Enemy goes LEFT to (5, 8) -> (4, 8). Still far.\n        *   If Enemy goes DOWN to (6, 7). Still far.\n        *   No head-on collision risk.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** UP is the best move to secure the top-left apples safely.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (1, 7). Position myself to grab the dense apple cluster at the top-left ((0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9)). Avoid getting trapped against the wall by staying at x=1 for now. Monitor enemy movement, but they are currently on the opposite side of the board.\n\nUP",

Body: [(6, 8), (5, 8)].\n    *   **Likely Moves:**\n        *   **UP (7, 9):** Is (7, 9) an apple? No. Is it safe? (7, 9) is empty (Board shows Row 9: `A A . . . . . . . .` -> Index 7 is `.`).

T 1 . . .` -> Index 8 is `.`).\n    *   **Prediction:** Enemy will likely not move LEFT (suicide). They will likely move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving UP or RIGHT moves them further away from me. Moving DOWN brings them slightly closer but keeps them in the center/right.\n\n3.  **My Available Moves from (1, 7):**\n    *   **UP (1, 8):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (1, 8).\n        *   **Board State:** Row 8: `A . . . .

(1, 8) is clear.\n        *   **Wall:** No.\n        *   **Safety:** Very safe. Leads to (1, 9) which is an Apple.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 7):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (0, 7).\n        *   **Board State:** Row 7: `A 0 . . . . . . .

I eat an apple.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 6):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (1, 6).\n        *   **Board State:** Empty (Will be my tail).\n        *   **Body Check:** (1, 6) is currently occupied by my body (Segment 1). **DEADLY.**\n        *   **Safety:** NO.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 7):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (2, 7).\n        *   **Board State:** Row 7: `A 0 . . . . . . .

This is on the left wall.\n        *   **Future Options (from 0,7):**\n            *   UP (0, 8): Apple.\n            *   DOWN (0, 6): Empty.\n            *   RIGHT (1, 7): My body (will be Segment 2).\n        *   **Risk:** Being on the wall limits me to 2 escape routes (Up, Down). However, Up leads to another apple (0, 8) and Down leads to safety (0, 6).\n    *   **Option UP (1, 8):**\n        *   **Immediate Reward:** No apple (1, 8) is empty.\n        *   **Position:** (1, 8). One step off the wall.\n        *   **Future Options (from 1,8):**\n            *   UP (1, 9): Apple.\n            *   DOWN (1, 7): My body.\n            *   LEFT (0, 8): Apple.\n            *   RIGHT (2, 8): Empty.\n        *   **Risk:** Minimal. Very open. 3 useful directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   I am currently at (1, 7). The apples are at (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9).\n        *   If I go LEFT to (0, 7) (Apple), I will be at (0, 7) with a length of 8. Next turn, I can go UP to (0, 8) (Apple).\n        *   If I go UP to (1, 8) (No Apple), I will be at (1, 8) with length 8. Next turn, I can go UP to (1, 9) (Apple) or LEFT to (0, 8) (Apple).\n        *   **Survival Analysis:**\n            *   Going LEFT puts me on the wall. This is slightly more restrictive.\n            *   However, the apple at (0, 7) is directly in front of me. Eating it now secures a point and shortens the distance to the next apple (0, 8).\n            *   If I go UP to (1, 8) and the enemy moves aggressively towards the center, I might lose access to the bottom-left apples later if I extend my tail too far north.\n            *   However, looking at the board, the bottom-left apples (1, 4, 2, 2, etc.) are still accessible from (1, 7) or (1, 6).\n            *   **Crucial Point:** By eating (0, 7), I am committing to the wall route. But (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9) is a straight line. It's a \"safe\" highway because only the head can collide.\n            *   **Counter-Argument:** Staying at (1, 8) gives me more options. I can choose to go LEFT to (0, 8) or UP to (1, 9). This flexibility is valuable.\n            *   **Wait:** If I go UP to (1, 8), I am NOT eating an apple. If I go LEFT to (0, 7), I AM eating an apple.\n            *   Score is 6 to 2. I am winning. I don't *need* to rush, but I should maintain the lead.\n            *   Is (0, 7) safe?\n                *   Enemy is at (7, 8).\n                *   If Enemy goes UP (7, 9), they are far.\n                *   If Enemy goes LEFT (6, 8) -> Suicide (body is there).\n                *   If Enemy goes DOWN (6, 7) -> Safe.\n                *   If Enemy goes RIGHT (8, 8) -> Safe.\n                *   No risk of head-on collision.\n            *   Is (0, 7) a trap?\n                *   (0, 6) is empty.\n                *   (0, 5) is empty.\n                *   I can always retreat down the left wall if I get blocked above.\n                *   However, if I go LEFT (0, 7), my tail is at (5, 6). Next turn, tail moves to (4, 6).\n                *   If I go UP (1, 8), my tail moves to (4, 6).\n                *   **Let's look at (1, 8) vs (0, 7) again.**\n                *   (0, 7) is an apple. Eating it is good.\n                *   (1, 8) is empty.\n                *   (1, 8) allows me to \"flex\". I can go UP to (1, 9) or LEFT to (0, 8). Both are apples.\n                *   If I am at (0, 7), I can ONLY go UP to (0, 8) or DOWN to (0, 6).\n                *   If I am at (1, 8), I have 3 options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).\n                *   **Survival > Greed.** 3 options > 2 options.\n                *   If I go LEFT to (0, 7) (Apple), I am on the wall.\n                *   If I go UP to (1, 8) (No Apple), I am positioned to eat (1, 9) OR (0, 8) next turn.\n                *   (1, 9) is an apple.\n                *   (0, 8) is an apple.\n                *   Going to (1, 8) keeps me flexible. I can choose the best apple next turn based on enemy movement.\n                *   If I go LEFT to (0, 7), I am forced into the wall corridor.\n                *   Given that the enemy is on the other side of the board, I am safe to maneuver.\n                *   **Decision:** UP to (1, 8). It keeps my options open and positions me perfectly to eat (1, 9) or (0, 8) next turn. It is safer because I am not on the wall.\n\n5.  **Final Move Selection:**\n    *   **UP** to (1, 8).\n    *   **Reasoning:** Maximizes future move options (3 directions) vs being on the wall (2 directions). Positions me to eat either (1, 9) or (0, 8) next turn. Safe from enemy.\n\nUP",

(9,8) is `1`. `1` is usually the ID for Snake 1.\n            If (9,8) is `1`, then (9,8) is the Head.\n            If (8,8) is `T`, then (8,8) is Body.\n            If (7,8) is `T`, then (7,8) is Body.\n            This matches the Body list (7,8), (6,8)? No, (6,8) is not T.\n            Visual Row 8 Index 6 is `.`.\n            **Wait, let's look at the prompt's \"Board state\" again.**\n            Row 8: `A 0 . . . . .

Maybe the text description `Head: (8,8)` is the location *before* the moves of the previous turn, and the board is the result?\n            No, the prompt says \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #1 - Head: (8, 8)...\".\n            **Let's assume the text is correct and the visual '1' at (9,8) is a display artifact or ID marker not position.**\n            BUT, if (9,8) is `1`, and it's a snake ID, it's likely the head.\n            Let's look at my snake representation.\n            Row 8: `A 0 . . . . .

T T . . . . . . A`\n            (6,6) is empty.\n            If the text is true, (6,8) should be body.\n            Row 8 Index 6 is `.`.\n            **This confirms the text is likely incorrect or describes a different state than the board.**\n            The board is the definitive representation of the grid.\n            **Therefore, Enemy Head is at (9,8). Enemy Body is (8,8) and (7,8).**\n\n2.  **Enemy Snake #1 Analysis (Based on Board State):**\n    *   **Head:** (9, 8).\n    *   **Body:** [(8, 8), (7, 8)].\n    *   **Moves:**\n        *   **UP (9, 9):** (9, 9) is empty (Row 9: `A A . . . . . . . .` -> Index 9 is `.`). Safe.\n        *   **DOWN (9, 7):** (9, 7) is empty (Row 7: `A T . . . . . . . A` -> Index 9 is `A`). Wait, Row 7: `A T . . . . . . . A`. Index 9 is `A`. So (9,7) is an Apple.\n        *   **LEFT (8, 8):** (8, 8) is occupied by Enemy Body. Suicide.\n        *   **RIGHT (10, 8):** Out of bounds.\n    *   **Prediction:** Enemy will likely move DOWN to (9, 7) to eat the apple, or UP to (9, 9).\n    *   **Threat:** If Enemy moves UP, they are safe. If they move DOWN, they eat.\n    *   **Collision Risk:** (9,8) is far from (1,8). No head-on collision risk.\n\n3.  **My Available Moves from (1, 8):**\n    *   **UP (1, 9):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (1, 9).\n        *   **Board State:** Row 9: `A A . . . . . . . .` -> Index 1 is `A`. (Apple).\n        *   **Body Check:** My body is at (1,7), (1,6)... (1,8) is head. (1,9) is clear.\n        *   **Safety:** Safe. Eat Apple.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 8):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (0, 8).\n        *   **Board State:** Row 8: `A 0 . . . . . T T 1 .` -> Index 0 is `A`. (Apple).\n        *   **Safety:** Safe. Eat Apple.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 7):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (1, 7).\n        *   **Board State:** Row 7: `A T . . . . . . . A` -> Index 1 is `T`.\n        *   **Body Check:** This is my body (Segment 1). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 8):**\n        *   **Coordinates:** (2, 8).\n        *   **Board State:** Row 8: `A 0 . . . . . T T 1 .` -> Index 2 is `.`.\n        *   **Safety:** Safe.\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   **Goal:** Eat apples, stay alive, outlast enemy.\n    *   **Current Position:** (1, 8). Two apples adjacent: (1, 9) and (0, 8).\n    *   **Option UP (1, 9):**\n        *   Eat Apple.\n        *   Position: (1, 9). Top edge.\n        *   Future moves: DOWN (1, 8) [My body], LEFT (0, 9) [Apple], RIGHT (2, 9) [Empty].\n        *   Future options: 2 directions (Left, Right).\n    *   **Option LEFT (0, 8):**\n        *   Eat Apple.\n        *   Position: (0, 8). Left edge.\n        *   Future moves: RIGHT (1, 8) [My body], UP (0, 9) [Apple], DOWN (0, 7) [Apple].\n        *   Future options: 2 directions (Up, Down).\n    *   **Option RIGHT (2, 8):**\n        *   No Apple.\n        *   Position: (2, 8). Center.\n        *   Future moves: UP (2, 9) [Empty], DOWN (2, 7) [Empty], LEFT (1, 8) [My body], RIGHT (3, 8) [Empty].\n        *   Future options: 3 directions (Up, Down, Right).\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Eating an apple (UP or LEFT) gives +1 score.\n        *   Moving RIGHT keeps options open but doesn't score.\n        *   Score is 6 to 2. I have a lead.\n        *   Eating now is efficient.\n        *   **Which apple is better?**\n        *   **Target (1, 9):**\n            *   Path: (1, 9) -> (0, 9) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 7).\n            *   (0, 9) is an apple.\n            *   (0, 8) is an apple.\n            *   (0, 7) is an apple.\n            *   This is a dense cluster.\n        *   **Target (0, 8):**\n            *   Path: (0, 8) -> (0, 9) -> (1, 9).\n            *   Same cluster, but arriving from the bottom.\n        *   **Survival Check:**\n            *   If I go UP to (1, 9), I am on the top edge.\n            *   If I go LEFT to (0, 8), I am on the left edge.\n            *   **Left Edge (0, 8):** Access to (0, 9) and (0, 7).\n            *   **Top Edge (1, 9):** Access to (0, 9) and (2, 9).\n            *   **Top Edge Advantage:** (2, 9) connects back to the center/right side of the board if I need to escape.\n            *   **Left Edge Disadvantage:** I am trapped on the left side. To get to the right side, I have to snake all the way back through the center, potentially blocking myself.\n            *   **Enemy Position:** Enemy is at (9, 8) (Right side).\n            *   **Conclusion:** (1, 9) is better than (0, 8) because it offers a connection to the right side (via 2,9) as well as the left side (via 0,9).\n            *   **Wait, is (1, 9) strictly better than (0, 8)?**\n            *   If I am at (1, 9), I can go to (0, 9) (Left wall) or (2, 9) (Center/Right).\n            *   If I am at (0, 8), I can go to (0, 9) (Top Left) or (0, 7) (Bottom Left). Both are walls.\n            *   **Decision:** UP to (1, 9). It gives access to an apple (1,9) and positions me at the corner intersection of the top row. From (1,9), I can choose to go Left to (0,9) (Apple) or Right to (2,9) (Safe/Explore). This keeps my long-term escape routes open.\n\n5.  **Final Move Selection:**\n    *   **UP** to (1, 9).\n    *   **Reasoning:** I can eat an apple at (1, 9). This puts me at the top edge, adjacent to (0, 9) (another apple) and (2, 9) (safe path to the right). This is superior to (0, 8) which traps me on the left wall with only vertical movement options. The enemy is on the right side, so maintaining connectivity to the right is wise.\n\nUP",

I notice a discrepancy between the text description and the visual representation in the prompt.\n*   **Text Description:** My head is at **(2, 9)**.\n*   **Visual Board:** Shows `0` at **(1, 9)**.\n*   **My Last Move:** I moved RIGHT. If I started at (1, 9) and moved RIGHT, I would be at (2, 9). This suggests the text description is the *result* of my last move (current state), and the visual board is a snapshot *before* that move or corrupted.\n*   **Decision:** I will trust the text description, which states my head is at **(2, 9)**, as it aligns logically with my previous move (RIGHT) and the stated turn number (14).\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head:** (2, 9)\n*   **My Body:** [(1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5)]\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (9, 7), Body [(8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)].\n*   **Apples:** I see an apple at (1, 9) in the visual, but the text says I am at (2, 9). If I am at (2, 9), I am not on an apple. If the text is correct, I need to find a safe move from (2, 9).\n\n**Move Evaluation (from Head (2, 9)):**\n\n1.  **UP:** (2, 10) -> **INVALID** (Outside board).\n2.  **DOWN:** (2, 8) -> **SAFE**.\n    *   Cell is empty in the text state (and visual, though visual is misleading).\n    *   No body collision.\n    *   This moves me off the top edge into the interior.\n3.  **LEFT:** (1, 9) -> **DANGEROUS**.\n    *   This is currently my body (segment 0 in the list `[(1, 9)...]`).\n    *   Moving here is suicide.\n4.  **RIGHT:** (3, 9) -> **SAFE**.\n    *   Cell is empty.\n    *   No body collision.\n    *   Keeps me on the top row.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n*   **Enemy:** The enemy is far away on the right side (x=9). I am on the left side (x=2).\n*   **Trapping Risk:** Staying on the top row (y=9) limits my vertical movement (can't go up). However, (2, 9) is a corner-adjacent spot, and going DOWN to (2, 8) opens up the board significantly (access to y=8, 7, 6...).\n*   **Top Row Access:** If I go DOWN, I can still access the top row later, but I lose immediate horizontal mobility on y=9. However, the top row is a \"corridor\" that often leads to dead ends.\n*   **Board Control:** Moving DOWN to (2, 8) allows me to utilize the central area of the board (y=8, 7, 6).\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **RIGHT to (3, 9):** Stays on the edge. Opens up (4, 9), (5, 9)... towards the enemy. Limited vertical options.\n    *   **DOWN to (2, 8):** Moves into the open space. Opens up (2, 7), (3, 8), (1, 8) (though (1, 8) is my body, it will move). This offers more flexibility for future turns.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (2, 8) is the most flexible move. It frees me from the top edge constraint and allows me to maneuver toward apples in the central part of the board (e.g., apples at (1, 7), (0, 7), (2, 6), etc.). While moving RIGHT keeps me away from my body (which extends left), DOWN opens up the largest number of future safe moves.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (2, 8) to enter the main play area and maintain maximum mobility for the next turn.\n\nDOWN",

Growing to (9,6) will leave follow-up options LEFT (8,6) or DOWN (9,5, another apple). That gives at least two legal follow-ups (no immediate trap).\n- UP to (9,8) is legal but more constraining: from (9,8) my only safe follow-up would be UP to (9,9) (LEFT is into my body at (8,8), DOWN is back into my neck). That reduces mobility and risks getting pressed against the top/right edges as I grow.\n- The enemy is far on the left and unlikely to contest the 9,x apple cluster this turn.\n\nDecision and short plan:\n- Take the apple at (9,6) now to increase score and keep flexible options. After that, consider chaining to (9,5) if safe, then move back toward x=8 to regain lateral space and avoid getting boxed on the right edge.

Moving here would cause immediate death. **INVALID**.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 7):** This cell is empty in the text description (visual shows 'A' but text says '.' and lists apples elsewhere). It is not occupied by my body or the enemy. **SAFE**.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 8):** This is part of my body (second segment). **INVALID**.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 8):** This cell is empty. **SAFE**.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (2, 7) or RIGHT to (3, 8).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 8):** This keeps me on row 8. Looking at row 8, (0, 8) contains an apple. However, (1, 8) is my body, so I cannot go left to get it. Moving right to (3, 8) leads towards an empty area. (4, 8) is empty, (5, 8) is empty.\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 7):** This moves me down towards the apple at (0, 7). Looking at the coordinate (2, 7), it is empty. From (2, 7), I can potentially move LEFT to (1, 7) and then UP to (1, 8) (which will be empty as my body moves). This opens up the left side of the board where multiple apples are located ((0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2)). The enemy is far to the right (x=9), so the left side is relatively safe from immediate interaction.\n\nMoving **DOWN** gives me access to the bottom-left quadrant of the board, which is rich in apples and allows for more maneuvering room than the top row. Staying on row 8 or moving right to row 8 restricts vertical movement. Moving down opens up vertical options.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (2, 7) to access the apple at (0, 7) and navigate towards the cluster of apples in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)]. Apples: 7.\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (9, 5). Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)]. Apples: 5.\n- **Apples:** (1, 4), (4, 2), (0, 8), (2, 2), (0, 7), (7, 2), (0, 9), (3, 3), (9, 5), (7, 1), (4, 4), (4, 1), (5, 6), (9, 3), (0, 2).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Safety of Potential Moves**\nFrom my head at (2, 7), let's evaluate the four cardinal directions:\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 8):**\n    -   (2, 8) is the first segment of my body.\n    -   **Result:** Immediate death (hit self).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 6):**\n    -   (2, 6) is the last segment of my body.\n    -   **Result:** Immediate death (hit self). *Note: Even though the tail usually moves, the rule states moving backwards into your own body is fatal.*\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 7):**\n    -   (1, 7) is part of my body (4th segment).\n    -   **Result:** Immediate death (hit self).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 7):**\n    -   **Check against my body:** (3, 7) is not in my body list: [(2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)].\n    -   **Check against enemy body:** (3, 7) is not in enemy body list: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)].\n    -   **Check against board edges:** (3, 7) is within the 0-9 range for both x and y.\n    -   **Result:** **SAFE.**\n\n**Step 2: Strategic Analysis**\nSince **RIGHT** is the only safe move that avoids immediate suicide, the decision is forced. However, we should look at the context to ensure we aren't blindly moving into a trap or setting up an immediate collision next turn.\n\n-   **Current Position:** (2, 7).\n-   **Safe Move:** RIGHT to (3, 7).\n-   **Future Safety Check:** From (3, 7), my body will shift: new tail will be (2, 7), new body will include (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6). My head will be at (3, 7).\n    -   **UP to (3, 8):** (3, 8) is currently empty.\n    -   **DOWN to (3, 6):** (3, 6) is currently empty.\n    -   **LEFT to (2, 7):** (2, 7) will be my tail, but the rule states moving backwards into your own body is fatal. **AVOID LEFT.**\n    -   **RIGHT to (4, 7):** (4, 7) is currently empty.\n    -   **Apples:** There is an apple at (3, 3) nearby (Down-Left). The cluster at (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 2), (1, 4) is reachable.\n\n-   **Enemy Threat:**\n    -   Enemy head is at (9, 5). Distance is large (7 columns away).\n    -   Enemy is likely chasing apples on the right side (e.g., (9, 3), (7, 2), (5, 6)).\n    -   No immediate threat of head-on collision in the next turn from the calculated position (3, 7).\n\n**Step 3: Apple Strategy**\nWhile the dense apple clusters are on the left (x=0 to x=3), I am currently pinned against my own body and the wall at x=2. I cannot move LEFT or UP/DOWN. The only path out of this corner is RIGHT.\n-   Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 7) relieves the pressure.\n-   From (3, 7), I can navigate DOWN towards (3, 3) or further right to (5, 6), or swing left towards the (0, x) cluster once my body length allows for safe maneuvering without self-collision.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **RIGHT** is the only legal move. It is safe and opens up the board.\n\n**Move Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (3, 7) to escape the corner and maintain survival.\n\nRIGHT",

UP would be my neck, RIGHT is off-board. That gives me two follow-ups; one is an apple (good for score), but staying on x=9 keeps me against the right wall, reducing future degrees of freedom.\n- If I go LEFT to (8,5): next-turn options include LEFT (7,5), UP (8,6), or DOWN (8,4). That's three follow-up directions and moves me away from the right edge into more open space, reducing the chance of getting boxed in by my own body later.\n\nStrategic reasoning:\n- Closing the apple gap is desirable, but safety and maintaining options matter more long-term. The enemy is on the far left and unlikely to contest the right-side apples this turn.\n- LEFT increases my available degrees of freedom and moves me into the board interior, which is preferable for maneuvering and contesting more apples later. From (8,5) I can still approach the apple at (9,3) (or other apples) while keeping escape routes.\n- I will avoid hugging the right wall and instead expand into the center, then pivot toward nearby apples when safe.\n\nShort-term plan for next few turns:\n- Move LEFT now to (8,5) to gain freedom.\n- From there, evaluate whether to head toward (9,3) for the apple or sweep left to collect central apples, always avoiding narrow corridors and watching the enemy\u2019s approach on the left.\n\nLEFT",

(3, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Enemy Body:** Empty.\n    *   **Result:** **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 7):**\n    *   **Board:** Valid.\n    *   **My Body:** The body list includes (2, 7) as the first segment (directly behind the head). Moving into your own body is fatal.\n    *   **Result:** **DEAD (Suicide).**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 7):**\n    *   **Board:** Valid.\n    *   **My Body:** Empty.\n    *   **Enemy Body:** Empty.\n    *   **Result:** **SAFE.**\n\n**Step 2: Strategic Analysis**\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n*   **Analyze UP (3, 8):**\n    *   This moves deeper into the top-left corner, increasing X to 3 and Y to 8.\n    *   Surrounding area: (3, 9) is open, (2, 8) is my body, (4, 8) is open.\n    *   Enemy at (8, 5) is far away; no immediate head-on collision threat.\n    *   Apple proximity: There are apples at (0, 9), (0, 8), (2, 9). Moving UP gets me closer to the top wall and the apples at the top-left corner.\n\n*   **Analyze DOWN (3, 6):**\n    *   Moves towards the center/bottom-left.\n    *   Apple proximity: There is an apple at (3, 3) directly below. However, moving DOWN brings the head to (3, 6), and the body will shift to include (2, 7), (2, 8), etc. (3, 6) is currently safe, but looking ahead to the next turn from (3, 6), the body segments (2, 6) and (1, 6) are nearby. Moving DOWN might expose the snake to entrapment near the center-bottom apples.\n\n*   **Analyze RIGHT (4, 7):**\n    *   Moves towards the right side.\n    *   Apple proximity: The nearest apples are at (4, 4) or (5, 6).\n    *   Enemy proximity: Enemy head is at (8, 5). Moving RIGHT increases proximity to the enemy.\n    *   Risk: The enemy is on the right side. If we move right, we might converge. However, the enemy is moving simultaneously. Calculating a potential interception is difficult without knowing their move, but moving towards the enemy is generally riskier than moving away or holding position, especially when the enemy is aggressive or guarding resources.\n\n**Step 3: Comparison and Decision**\nComparing the options:\n*   **RIGHT** moves towards the enemy's territory (right side). The enemy is at (8,5). While the board is 10x10, the right side is their domain. Engaging there risks a head-on collision or getting cut off. I currently have more apples (7 vs 5), so I should play somewhat conservatively to preserve the lead.\n*   **UP** moves into a corner, but it is a corner I already occupy. The space is open above me (3,9). The apples at (0,9), (0,8), and (2,9) are very close. By moving UP, I can secure the (0,9) and (2,9) apples quickly.\n*   **DOWN** is viable, but UP offers a clearer path to high-value apple clusters (0,9) that are isolated from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nMy immediate goal is to secure the apples in the top-left corner ((0,9), (0,8), (2,9)) to boost my score while staying away from Snake #1 on the right. Moving UP positions me perfectly to sweep this cluster. Once I clear the corner, I can decide whether to descend toward the center or loop around.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMove **UP** to (3, 8). This is safe, avoids the enemy, and moves towards the dense apple cluster at the top of the board.\n\nUP",

No enemy head threat nearby, so prioritizing space and future mobility is best.\n\nShort plan for next turns: Expand into the center (via LEFT/UP as needed), then head toward the cluster around (5,6) and (4,4)/(3,4).

Body list: [(3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7)].\n        *   (3, 9) is empty.\n    *   **Enemy Body:** Snake #1 at (7, 5). (3, 9) is empty.\n    *   **Result:** **SAFE.**\n    *   **Note:** Moving here shifts my body to [(3, 8), (3, 7), ...]. This blocks the (3, 8) cell I just left.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):**\n    *   **Board:** Valid.\n    *   **My Body:** The body list includes (3, 7) as the first segment (directly behind the head). Moving into your own body is fatal.\n    *   **Result:** **DEAD (Suicide).**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):**\n    *   **Board:** Valid.\n    *   **My Body:** The body list includes (2, 8). It is the third segment, but it is currently occupied by my body. Moving into it is fatal.\n    *   **Result:** **DEAD (Suicide).**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):**\n    *   **Board:** Valid.\n    *   **My Body:** Empty.\n    *   **Enemy Body:** Empty.\n    *   **Result:** **SAFE.**\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\n*   **Option UP (3, 9):**\n    *   **Positioning:** Moves to the top-right of my current position. This is the top wall (y=9).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apples:** The apple at (2, 9) is one step LEFT from here.\n    *   **Enemy:** Snake #1 is at (7, 5). This move keeps us separated.\n    *   **Risk:** Moving UP puts me in the corner (x=3, y=9). This limits future movement. From (3, 9), the only valid moves to empty spaces next turn might be restricted to LEFT (to 2,9) or DOWN (back to 3,8). If I go UP, I am committing to a path along the top wall.\n\n*   **Option RIGHT (4, 8):**\n    *   **Positioning:** Moves to (4, 8).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apples:** Not directly on an apple, but opens access to (5, 6) or (7, 2).\n    *   **Enemy:** Moves me slightly closer to the enemy (distance to (7,5) decreases).\n    *   **Freedom:** (4, 8) is an open space. From there, I can move UP (4,9), DOWN (4,7), LEFT (back), or RIGHT (5,8). It keeps my options open significantly better than going UP to the wall.\n\n**Comparison and Decision:**\n\nThe key constraint is that my body blocks (3, 7) and (2, 8). I cannot go DOWN or LEFT.\nMy choice is strictly between UP (to the wall) and RIGHT (into the open).\n\n*   **Isolation vs. Mobility:** The apple cluster at (0,9), (0,8), (2,9) is in the top-left corner. My current head is at (3, 8). To reach those apples efficiently, I need to navigate there. Moving UP to (3, 9) corners me. I would have to go LEFT to (2, 9) to get the apple there. However, (2, 9) is currently occupied by *my* tail. By the time I move UP to (3, 9), my tail will move from (1, 7) to somewhere else (likely eating an apple or just shifting).\n    *   *Correction:* My body is [(3,7), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7)]. The tail is at (1,7). If I move UP, the new body becomes [(3,8), (3,7), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8)]. The cell (2,9) remains occupied by my body.\n    *   So, if I go UP to (3,9), the next move LEFT to (2,9) is fatal (hitting my own body segment).\n\n*   **The Trap of Going UP:**\n    If I go UP to (3, 9), I am at the wall. My body occupies (2, 9) and (3, 8). My only safe move next turn would likely be DOWN to (3, 8) (which will be empty when my tail moves), but that backtracks. Or I could go LEFT to (2, 9), but that hits my body. Or I could go RIGHT to (4, 9). (4, 9) is currently empty. So I have one viable move: (4, 9) or (3, 8). It's tight.\n\n*   **The Freedom of Going RIGHT:**\n    If I go RIGHT to (4, 8), I open up the board. My body becomes [(3, 8), (3, 7), ...]. The space (3, 9) becomes open (if I don't go there).\n    From (4, 8), I can move UP (4, 9). (4, 9) is open.\n    From (4, 8), I can move RIGHT (5, 8).\n    From (4, 8), I can move DOWN (4, 7).\n\n**Re-evaluating the Apple Strategy:**\nThe apples at (2, 9) and (0, 9) are \"top apples\".\nMy current head is at (3, 8).\nTo get to (2, 9), I can go UP -> LEFT. But as established, going UP to (3, 9) makes LEFT to (2, 9) dangerous because my body will be filling that space (specifically segment 5 is (2, 9)).\nHowever, if I go UP to (3, 9), my body becomes [(3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8)].\nWait, the apple at (2, 9) is *currently* at (2, 9). My body currently occupies (2, 9).\nIf I go UP, I eat the apple at (3, 9)? No, (3, 9) is empty.\nIf I go UP, I don't eat an apple this turn.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 8), I also don't eat an apple.\n\n**Conclusion on Strategy:**\nMoving UP traps me in the corner. While the apples are there, my own body is in the way. To safely collect the corner apples, I need to approach them from a position that doesn't force me into my own tail.\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 8) gives me breathing room. It allows me to approach the top wall from x=4 or x=5, effectively \"flanking\" my own body to get to the apples at (2,9) and (0,9).\nAdditionally, Snake #1 is on the right, but at (7,5). Moving to (4, 8) is not an immediate collision course. It keeps the game flexible.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nChoose **RIGHT** to maintain mobility and avoid getting trapped against the wall by my own body.\n\nRIGHT",

However, (2,9) and (1,9) are occupied by my tail.\n            *   If I go UP to (4,9), my body becomes `[(4,8), (3,8), (3,7), ...]`. The tail leaves (1,8).\n            *   To get to the apple at (0,9), I'd have to go LEFT, LEFT, LEFT. But (1,9) and (2,9) are currently occupied by my body. By the time I reach them, they might be empty (tail moving), but it's tight.\n        *   **DOWN (4, 7):**\n            *   This moves me into the open space below.\n            *   My body becomes `[(4,7), (3,8), ...]`.\n            *   This opens up the path to the apples at (4, 4), (5, 6), (7, 2).\n            *   (4, 7) is currently empty.\n            *   From (4, 7), I have access to (4, 6), (3, 7), (5, 7), (4, 8).\n            *   (3, 7) is currently occupied by my body (segment 2).

Will it be free next turn? No, my body is growing/shifting. (3, 7) will remain occupied (it becomes segment 3).\n            *   So from (4, 7), I can move DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7 - occupied by me), RIGHT (5,7), UP (4,8 - occupied by me).\n            *   Only (4, 6) is a new direction.\n        *   **RIGHT (5, 8):**\n            *   This moves me to x=5.\n            *   My body becomes `[(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), ...]`.\n            *   From (5, 8), I can move UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8 - occupied), RIGHT (6,8).\n            *   (5, 8) is empty.\n            *   (6, 8) is empty.\n            *   (5, 7) is empty.\n            *   This path heads towards the apple at (5, 6) and the right side of the board.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **UP** puts me against the wall. Limited mobility. No immediate apple gain. The path to (0,9) is blocked by my own body segments (2,9) and (1,9) which will persist for a few turns.\n        *   **DOWN** leads to (4, 7), which offers only one new path (Down to 4,6) because Left and Right are blocked by my own body segments that are shifting.\n        *   **RIGHT** leads to (5, 8), which offers access to (5,9), (6,8), (5,7). This is a much more open area. It moves me away from the tight cluster on the left and towards the apples in the center/right.\n\n    *   **Enemy Consideration:**\n        *   Enemy is at (6, 5). Moving to (5, 8) keeps a safe distance.\n        *   Enemy body is at (7, 5) and (9, 5), etc. I am not moving into immediate danger.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:**\n        *   **RIGHT (5, 8)** is the best move.

Body segments form a cluster on the left (x=1-3, y=7-9).\n2.  **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (6, 6) with a body trailing down the right side and a horizontal segment at y=5.\n3.  **Board Assessment:**\n    *   **Left (x=4):** Empty at (4, 8) (my previous tail, now empty), (4, 9) (empty), (4, 7) (empty). However, (3, 8), (3, 7), etc., are occupied by my body. Going left puts me back into the \"cage\" of my own body, reducing mobility.\n    *   **Right (x=6):** (6, 8) is empty. (6, 7) is empty. (6, 6) has the enemy head.\n    *   **Down (y=7):** (5, 7) is empty. This is a strong candidate as it opens up the lower board (y=0-6).\n    *   **Up (y=9):** (5, 9) is empty. However, y=9 is the top wall, which limits escape routes to the left or right.\n\n2.  **Comparing Moves:**\n    *   **UP to (5, 9):** Gets me to the top edge. From there, I can only go Left, Right, or Down. This is a \"dead end\" direction because I can't go further up. It limits my long-term options.\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 8):** This is a safe square (formerly my tail). However, it brings me closer to my own body mass on the left side. My body occupies x=1-3. If I go Left, my future choices are Up (4,9 - wall), Down (4,7 - open), or Right (back to 5,8). It keeps me in the top-left corner.\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 8):** This moves me toward the enemy's side of the board. While (6, 8) is currently empty, the enemy head is at (6, 6). Moving right puts me on a collision course with the enemy if they move Up. Additionally, the enemy body is heavily clustered at x=7, 8, 9 at y=5 and down. Moving further right (x=7, 8) is dangerous. This direction feels risky and limits my movement to the right side of the board where the enemy dominates.\n    *   **DOWN to (5, 7):** This is the most open direction.\n        *   It moves me away from the top wall (limiting factor).\n        *   It moves me away from the dense left-side body cluster.\n        *   It moves me away from the enemy's current position (at y=6) and the right-side blockage.\n        *   From (5, 7), I have access to (5, 6), (5, 8), (4, 7), and (6, 7). This is a central pivot point to access apples in the middle of the board (like 4,4 and 5,6) or drop down further.\n\n3.  **Strategic Conclusion:**\n    The goal is to maximize future options and avoid confinement. \"Right\" heads toward the enemy territory. \"Up\" heads toward a wall. \"Left\" heads toward my own body. **\"Down\"** opens up the most board space and positions me to attack the apples in the center/mid-right region (5,6, 4,4, etc.) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 7) to open up the center of the board. From there, pursue the apple at (5, 6) or (4, 4) next turn. Keep the enemy in the top-right corner and avoid direct confrontation. Use the center to maneuver.\n\nDOWN",

They cannot reach (5,6) this turn (they can go to 5,7 next turn). If I take (5,6) now I deny that apple to them and increase my apples from 5 -> 6, narrowing their lead.\n- If I move LEFT and eat, the enemy could move to (5,7) next turn to threaten the apple area, but if they then move into my body later they would die, so they'll likely avoid suicide. Taking the apple now forces them to either give ground or attempt a risky contest.\n- UP (6,7) or RIGHT (7,6) keep more immediate space but defer the apple; letting that apple sit gives the enemy a chance to approach and contest on their next move.\n- After eating at (5,6), I will have good escape options (LEFT to (4,6), DOWN to (5,5), or BACK toward center) and I can use my body safely to discourage a direct enemy head collision (if an enemy head moves into my body they die).\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Eat (5,6) this turn.

Use my body as a deterrent to risky enemy advances.\n\nLEFT",

Body stretches to the left and up: [(5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)].\n2.  **Enemy Position:** Head at (6, 6). Body trails down and to the right: [(6, 6), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6)].\n3.  **Board Assessment:**\n    *   **Left (x=4):** (4, 7) is empty. However, (4, 8) is occupied by my body (my neck). If I go Left to (4, 7), I am moving adjacent to my own body, potentially trapping myself if I don't have an escape route.\n    *   **Right (x=6):** (6, 7) is empty. This moves me horizontally away from my body mass. However, the enemy head is at (6, 6), which is directly below (6, 7).\n    *   **Up (y=8):** (5, 8) is occupied by my body (my neck). Moving Up would be moving directly backwards into my own body, which is a death sentence.\n    *   **Down (y=6):** (5, 6) is currently empty. However, the enemy head is at (6, 6). This is a critical intersection.\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision (The \"Tug of War\"):**\n    *   **The Trap:** The enemy snake is currently at (6, 6). If I move **Right** to (6, 7), I will be directly above the enemy. The enemy's best move to kill me is to go **Up** to (6, 7), resulting in a head-on collision where we both die. This is a high-risk move that relies on the enemy not wanting to die. Given the scores (7 vs 6), a mutual death favors the score leader (me), but staying alive is better.\n    *   **The Opportunity:** The apple at (5, 6) is directly below me. If I move **Down** to (5, 6), I will be on the apple.\n    *   **The Risk:** If I move **Down** to (5, 6) and the enemy moves **Left** to (5, 6), we will collide head-on and both die. If the enemy moves **Up** to (6, 7), they will not hit me (I am at 5,6).\n    *   **The Calculation:** The enemy is at (6, 6). They cannot move Down (off board or blocked? Actually y=5 is valid, but their body is there). They cannot move Right (off board? x=7 is valid, but their body is at 7,5? No, wait. Their body is at (7, 5), (8, 5), etc. Moving Right to (7, 6) is valid. Moving Left to (5, 6) is valid. Moving Up to (6, 7) is valid.\n    *   **Why Down is better than Right:**\n        *   If I go **Right (6,7)**: The enemy can easily move **Up (6,7)** and kill us both. The enemy might prefer this trade because they are losing (6 vs 7 apples).\n        *   If I go **Down (5,6)**: I eat the apple. The enemy is at (6,6). For them to kill me, they must move **Left (5,6)**. If they do, we die. If they move **Up (6,7)**, we live. If they move **Right (7,6)**, we live.\n    *   **Comparison:** Moving Right places me in a position where the enemy has a *forced* kill move (Up) that results in a draw (or disadvantage for me if I don't grow). Moving Down places me on an apple and forces the enemy to choose a specific move (Left) to kill me, whereas other moves (Up, Right) allow me to survive.\n    *   **Conclusion:** I will move **DOWN**. It is the only move that guarantees growth (eating the apple) and avoids moving into a position where the enemy has a trivial kill on me. Even if the enemy moves Left and we die, the game ends in a draw or a loss only because I ate the apple (Score 8 vs 6), which is a better outcome than dying without the apple or dying in a draw.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (5, 6) by moving Down. This positions me centrally and forces the enemy to commit to a move. If I survive, I will look to navigate towards the cluster of apples at (4, 4), (4, 2), or (5, 2) next, while keeping the enemy pinned near the right wall.\n\nDOWN",

Moving into their head risks a head-on or swap that could be fatal depending on their move -> risky.\n- DOWN -> (5,5) appears empty -> legal.\n- LEFT -> (4,6) appears empty -> legal.\n\nTactical evaluation:\n- The enemy head at (5,7) can move left or right to avoid moving into my head; they could also try to move down into my current position if I vacate (a risky play for them). I should avoid directly contesting the enemy head square (UP) to reduce the chance of a head-on or ambiguous swap death.\n- LEFT to (4,6) moves me away from the immediate head-on danger, keeps multiple escape routes (up, left, down) open, and positions me closer to central apples (notably the cluster around (4,4),(3,4),(3,3)).\n- DOWN to (5,5) is also safe this turn but would limit my immediate rightward options (6,5 is my own body) and keeps me closer to the enemy vertical column, increasing the chance of messy head interactions next turn.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (4,6). Then press toward the central apple cluster (4,4),(3,4),(3,3) while maintaining lateral mobility. Use my body to deter the enemy from diving into my torso; avoid moving into squares adjacent to the enemy head unless I'm sure of the outcome. Keep distance so I can outmaneuver rather than brawl.\n\nLEFT",
