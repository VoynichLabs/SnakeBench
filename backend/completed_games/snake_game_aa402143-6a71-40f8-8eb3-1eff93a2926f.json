The only other snake on the board is snake #2, which is at (6, 3).\n\nGiven that my snake is currently at the top-right corner of the board, I have limited options for movement. Moving left or down would potentially lead me to run into the walls, which would result in my death. The best option seems to be moving up to collect the apple at (5, 9).\n\nAdditionally, I should keep an eye on the enemy snake #2, as it is positioned relatively close to me. I don't want to inadvertently run into it and lose the game.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to try to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding the walls and the enemy snake. I will move UP."

The nearest apple to my position at (6, 3) is the one at (5, 6).\n- I also need to avoid the enemy snake and colliding with the wall or myself.\n- Moving up to (6, 4) will not yield a benefit immediately, but it will position me closer to the apples.\n- Moving down would be risky as it could lead to a collision with the wall or other snakes.\n- Moving left or right would also not be strategic, as it would put me in a position where I might collide with other snakes or a wall.\n\nMy strategy for eating the nearest apple is to move diagonally, but since diagonal moves are not allowed, I should approach the (5, 6) apple from below by leaving my position at (6, 3), causing my next move to be UP.\n\nNext turn, I should remind myself to watch out for any moves that the snake ID 1 makes and stay alert to avoid collisions.\n\nMy next move: UP"
