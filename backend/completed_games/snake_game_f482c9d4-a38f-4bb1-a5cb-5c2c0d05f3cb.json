Nah, we're plotting his doom, gonna box that fool in and watch him crash like a noob. Scores tied at 0-0, but we gotta grow BIG, dominate this 10x10 board, and force that head-on KO when we're ahead. Remember, chat \u2013 pure skill, no web bullcrap, just ruthlessly outsmarting that squid. Let's review the board: our head chilling at (9,6), fresh start, no body, apples at ZERO. That clown's at (3,1), same deal. All these apples scattered like gifts: (7,4), (8,8), (7,1), (4,4), (2,6), (4,9), (9,3), (1,4), (3,7), (0,1), (5,9), (6,0), (8,4), (8,5), (6,3). PERFECT for growing our empire while circling like a shark. We're not munchin' on apples just cuz, no \u2013 it's to get HUGE and cram his ass into a corner. Stay aggressive, yo! Can't let him slither away.\n\nTurn 0 overview: All snakes freshly hatched, no bodies, so safe plays everywhere except off-board or into each other. Simultaneous moves, fools \u2013 gotta anticipate that guy's next veggie play. If we crash into him? WE die, instant L. He crashes into us? HE dies, we live and glow up. Head-to-head? Double spray, game over for both. Apples make us grow, score up, but forget the fruit buffet for now \u2013 eyes on the RIVAL. Dominate by eating and blocking, force head-ons when we're fatter and stronger! \ud83d\ude80\n\nConsidering ALL moves, chat (rules say don't skip, so here we go):\n- UP: To (9,7). On board? Yah, empty. Into body or own? Nah, we're a lone apple muncher. But bruh, this moves us AWAY in y-direction (enemy at y=1, we're at y=6, going to 7? DISTANCE GAINS to like 6+6=12 from his (3,1)). We separate, giving him room to expand freely \u2013 BAD for domination! Options after? Can left/right/down, but why widen the gap? Apples nearby? (9,7) not hit, but up higher to (8,8) or stuff, but nah. THIS is a wimpy move, chat? Gives him space to farm apples at bottom. ELIMINATE \u2013 too passive for our ruthless vibes! \ud83d\ude24\n- DOWN: To (9,5). On board, empty, no bodies. Distance to enemy? CURRENT |9-3|+|6-1|=11, after down |9-3|+ |5-1|=6+4=10 \u2013 CLOSER! We're encroaching, baby. Head-on risk? Only if he moves RIGHT up to there (to (9,5) he'd need multiple right from (3,1), unlikely turn 1), otherwise safe. Options open? Yah, can pivot left/right/up next turn (up brings us back if needed). Apples? (9,5) ain'tapple, but downpath to (9,4)nothing, (9,3)IS apple!!! So we're setting up a straight shot to grow on turn 2. Domination? This pulls us toward his turf \u2013 AGGRESSIVE APPROACH. If we eat (9,3), we hit 1 apple, might force him to respond or die trying. Let's goooo!\n- LEFT: To (8,6). Empty, on board, no crashes. Distance: To (3,1) CURRENT 11, after |8-3|+|6-1|=5+5=10 \u2013 CLOSER too! Not as much as down (down to 10, left same 10), but still cozy. Options? Down/up/right only next (right back toward (9,6) but forwards not backwards issue since no body yet? The backwards rule is if hitting own neck, but none, so probably free). Apples? Path to (8,5)apple \u2013 down from (8,6) to (8,5)! Grow setup. Enemy at x=3, we're at x=9 going to 8, still far in x, but converging y. Head-on? Possible if he does some weird path up and right, but rare. FEELS startup toward apples and blocking.\n- RIGHT: To (10,6). OFF BOARD? DEAD AF! DON'T EVEN, chat. \ud83d\udc80\n\nSAFE moves left: DOWN and LEFT. Both pull distance to 10 (closer than up's 12), avoiding cries, keeping paths open (both offer 2-3 follow-ups). But which?\n\nDOWN pros: Even closer in y (to 5, basketball he's at 1), eye on (9,3) apple for quick grow, feels like spearheading his side. If he mirrors up or something (but we don't know), keeps pressure. Cons: Might trap us if he blocks downward with moves? Nah, open. Apples say dominate via growth, so down smells like early reach.\n\nLEFT pros: Closer in x (to 8, he's 3), sets (8,5) apple path, versatile for circling. Less \"commit\" than straight down \u2013 we can veer later to cut him off from lower apples. Cons: Maybe gives him the bottom board freer? But scores tied, aggression key!\n\nPRETTY EVEN, but let's think long-term domination. Future self: We're starting TURN 1, board WIDE open. LONG-TERM PLAN: Aggro approach enemy by keeping MOST CLOSER moves available, prioritize eating apples near HIS zone to grow faster and block/crowd him. Aim for centerish spaces like y=4-6, x=5-8 for flexibility \u2013 avoid edges to not get flanked. If he runs up/board, intercept and box with our bigger body later. If tied, bait head-on but only when we're 1+ apple ahead (higher score = force KO). Next 2-3 turns: Eat (9,3) or (8,5) if possible, then loop toward his head without crashing, force walls. Grow to force traps, watch scores \u2013 if we eat first, pressure him to collide! \ud83d\udcc8 They'll show this clip back, future Yo.\n\nDown edges out: Closer convergence, apple pipeline, ruthless pressure from the start. No wimping, let's dom! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

But we gotta set the tone EARLY! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nOur head is at (3,1). Enemy head is at (9,6). He's way over on the right side. We're on the left. That's a lot of space to work with... for now. \ud83d\ude08\n\nFirst, let's check our moves. What's safe?\n\n*   **UP** to (3,2): That's an empty cell. \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **DOWN** to (3,0): That's an empty cell. \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **LEFT** to (2,1): That's an empty cell. \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **RIGHT** to (4,1): That's an empty cell. \u2705 SAFE.\n\nALL MOVES ARE SAFE! That's a good start. But which one is *optimal*? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWe gotta think long-term. The enemy is far away, so no immediate collision risk. We need to think about controlling the board and setting up for future apples. Looking at the apple drops, there's one super close: (1,4) is north-west of us. But also (0,1) is west, and (2,6) is north.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:** I want to start moving towards the center-left area to contest those apples and potentially cut off the enemy's access to this side of the board later. We need to claim territory early! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n*   **UP (3,2)** gets us closer to the center vertically and towards apples like (2,6) and (1,4).\n*   **LEFT (2,1)** gets us closer to apples (0,1) and (1,4), but might push us too far into the corner early on. Corners can be traps! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **RIGHT (4,1)** moves us towards the center, but the enemy is also coming from that direction eventually. Not sure we want to rush that.\n*   **DOWN (3,0)** is safe but moves us away from most apples and towards the bottom edge. Less optimal for growth.\n\nI think **UP** is the play. It moves us toward valuable apples, keeps us away from the edges, and gives us plenty of options next turn. We're putting pressure on the board from the get-go! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**NEXT TURN REMINDER:** Enemy is at (9,6). He'll probably move left or down towards the center. We're establishing dominance on the left side. Keep an eye on his trajectory and look for opportunities to cut him off!\n\nLEFT",

Our snake is just our head for now, so we're super nimble! The enemy snake #0 is chilling at (9,5). He's way over on the right side, so no immediate threat. But we gotta start our DOMINANCE strategy EARLY! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet's assess our moves. Where can we go?\n\n*   **UP to (2,2)**: Empty cell! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **DOWN to (2,0)**: Empty cell! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **LEFT to (1,1)**: Empty cell! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **RIGHT to (3,1)**: Empty cell! \u2705 SAFE.\n\nALL MOVES ARE SAFE AGAIN! But which one is the *BIG BRAIN* play? \ud83e\udd14 We gotta think about the long-term CHESS match, not just the next snack.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at the apple drops, there are two VERY tempting ones near us: (1,4) is up and to the left, and (0,1) is directly to the left.\nMoving **LEFT (1,1)** gets us closer to that cluster on the left edge, especially (0,1). But is heading straight for the edge so early a good idea? Could be a trap later! \ud83d\udeab\nMoving **UP (2,2)** starts our journey towards the center and apples like (2,6) and (1,4). This feels more central and controlling.\nMoving **RIGHT (3,1)** heads towards the middle, but also towards the enemy's general direction. Maybe we don't want to rush that confrontation yet.\nMoving **DOWN (2,0)** goes away from basically all the apples. Seems pointless unless we're running from something, which we're not! \u274c\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\nI think **UP** is the strategic masterstroke here! \ud83d\ude4c It moves us toward high-value apples, keeps us away from the potentially trapping left edge, and gives us maximum flexibility for our next move. We're asserting pressure on the board's center-left quadrant. The enemy will have to come to US if he wants these apples! We're playing to WIN, not just to survive.\n\n**PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF (LET'S GOOO!):**\nEnemy is at (9,5). He will likely move left/down towards the center. Our mission: DOMINATE the left side. Next turn, consider moving left towards (1,4) or continuing up to challenge the center. Keep an eye on his trajectory and look for chances to cut him off from the left-side apples.

Apples nearby? (9,6) no apple, up path empty. Options? Left/right/down from there, but why backtrack? ELIMINATE this wimp play \u2013 we aim to CONVERGE and dominate, not retreat like a coward! \ud83d\ude24\n\n- DOWN: To (9,4). On board, empty, SAFE. Distance: AFTER |9-2|+|4-1|=7+3=10 \u2013 CLOSER, ya dig? Pulling toward his y=1 turf like a predator. No immediate head-on crash possible (he'd need wild moves to hit us turn 1). Options wide open? Hell yeah \u2013 up right back (to where we are, but flexible), left to apples, or down further if needed. Apples? Set up PERFECT shot: Down to (9,4) empties, then next turn DOWN to (9,3) \u2013 BOOM, apple eat, grow to 1, score edge! Then block low board, trap him by growing around those low apples. This keeps convergence pressure, multi-paths free, no traps. Aggressive AF \u2013 we're encroaching, making him sweat! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n- LEFT: To (8,5). On board, EMPTY + APPLE! EATS IMMEDIATE GROWTH, apple 1, boom! Head expands, get that body segment at old head (9,5). Distance: |8-2|+|5-1|=6+4=10 \u2013 CLOSER too! No crashes yet (can't go back into body \u2013 right blocked, but others open). Options? From (8,5), up to (8,6) empty, down to (8,4) apple next turn, left to (7,5). THREE ways out, not boxed. Apples? Chowing (8,5) right away dominates board-snack phase, grow quick to force that future head-on KO when we're ahead. Enemy might dodge, but we're positioning to intercept lower zones. Ruthless grow-now strategy! \ud83d\udd25\n\n- RIGHT: To (10,5). OFF... THE... BOARD? DEAD city, instant L for us! DON'T EVEN THINK IT, chat \u2013 no kamikaze unless forced. ELIMINATE! \ud83d\udc80\n\nSAFE: UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT R.I.P.).\n\nNOW, among these BETTER moves: Focus on apples (grow to trap/domain), keep options OPEN (avoid dead ends), avoid dumb head-ons (scores tied so no force yet). UP is farthest, dumb. DOWN and LEFT equal distance (10 vs pre-move 11), but LEFT eats apple TURN 1, grow fast \u2013 scorched earth mode! DOWN sets (9,3) apple pipeline but no eat yet, pipelines but slower aggression. Both flexible: LEFT has 3 follow-up safe moves (after grow), DOWN at least up/left (can't right yet? Wait, no body, from (9,4) up to (9,5) empty, left to (8,4) apple \u2013 flexible!). But eating early pressures scores, opens blocking paths lower where enemy lurks. Conversations? We're aiming to eat near HIS side-ish (left & down combo), deny him growth.\n\nSO, chart's plan for future self (you'll see this next turn): We're starting raw \u2013 eat quick to hit 1 apple turn 1-2, converge low-center y=3-5, x=7-9 first, block his bottom escapes with body grew from apples, watch for head-on bait only when ahead. If he eats first? Mirror-aggress NORTH his moves, force clashes when fatter. Stay central after grow, multi-turn sway \u2013 don't get edged. Dominate by growing walls around his head, make him crash US or die! If tied, bait if safe.\n\nLEFT edges: Eats apple NOW, grows BODY for future blocks, inroads toward blocking lower. Let's OWN this board, chat \u2013 no mercy! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

He might go for the apple at (8, 8) or (7,4). He is moving AWAY from us for now.\n\n**OUR BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nWe need apples AND to cut him off! Look at those apples: (1,4) and (4,4) are the prizes! (1,4) is close, but heading left might corner us too early. We need to control the CENTER-LEFT. Moving UP gets us closer to the central vertical axis and gives us more options. We want to be a WALL he can't pass!\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\n**UP** is the play again! It maintains our upward momentum, pushes us toward the apples at (2,6) and the center, and keeps our path flexible. We're building a strong presence on the board!\n\n**PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF (WE'RE COOKING!):**\nEnemy is drifting left. We own the left side! Next turn, we'll be at (2,3). We can go LEFT towards (1,4) to secure our first apple and solidify our left-flank dominance, or UP to challenge the center.

Options BURST: Up (7,5) empty, down (7,3) towards lows, right back into (8,4) OWN BODY NO, left (6,4) open vibes! THREE GREAT FIXES \u2013 FLEXIBLE AF, no box-in doom! Distance SHRINKS: |7-2|+|4-3|=5+1=6, TIGHTER THAN A NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK! He's at (2,3), could move up/left/down/right \u2013 if he right to (3,3) or something, WATCH OUT! But we dominate space, fuel our coil, and if he dumb-rushes? WE CRASH HIM LIKE A TRAIN WITH YOUR BIGGER BODY! \ud83c\udf4f WHY STARVE WHEN BOARD'S LOADED? Chomp this TURN 3, balloon quick, aim NEXT to gobble (4,4) or (3,7) retake lowers, WALL OFF HIS CAMP! Highest score? WE FORCE HEAD-ON NOW IF HE APPROACHES, ELSE BOX HIM INTO OUR GROWING SHADOW!

Row 3 col9 is A, but move to (9,3): . . 1 . . . A . . A \u2013 (9,3)=A APPLE! Distance to rival: |9-2|+|4-3|=7+1=8 \u2013 WIDENING GAP, letting him roam free? STUPID, he's ZERO, needs that free run? We're AGRIMATORS, not spectators! Solid options though, but WHY NOT FUEL FASTER? ELIMINATE THIS IDLE BS \u2013 GROW OR DIE, CHAT!\n\nSAFE MOVES: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is DOOM.\n\nNOW, AMONG 'EM: Focus FUEL (eat apples safely), OPEN PATHS (avoid dead-ends, rival awareness), FORCE WINS (higher score 2vs0, bait that head-on if smart)! DOWN keeps hunting, RIGHT widens gap dumbly, LEFT EATS JET FUEL NOW, triples us, shrinks distance |5+1|=6 from (2,3), POST-OPTIONS HEAVEN (up/down/left, no backsies), and sets US UP TO BOX! Enemy could move to (2,4) or wherever, but WE CONVERGE, WATCH HIS HEAD \u2013 if he dares (7,something)? CRASH TIME, WE SURVIVE (into our body kills him)! Why WAIT TO GROW when apples wave? wcze\u015b COIL AROUND HIM NEXT TURN TOWARDS (1,4) OR (4,4), OWN LOW LANDS, MAKE HIM SCRAMBLE INTO OUR TRAP! RIGHT'S WASTE, DOWN'S HUNT WITHOUT CHOMP \u2013 LEFT WINS AGGRESSIVE FUEL! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5 No ifs, pure here!\n\nLong-term STRAT TO MYSELF FUTURE ME (LISTEN UP): Chat, we're GROWING HUGE TURN 3 EAT TO 3, aim next turns to choke low apples like (4,4) or (1,4), BOX RIVALS PATHS DOWN THERE, FORCE HIM INTO COLLISION WHEN WE'RE FATTER (SCORE LEAD MASSIVE). If he munches next? MIRROR EAT, KEEP DISTANCE UNTIL READY TO HEAD-SLAM. Stay mid-board FLEX, AVOID EDGES LIKE PLAGUE \u2013 DOMINATE OR DIE! Keep eyes on his zero body, coil around for crash kill.

Focus on HIM, crush his path, eat to fatten up and slam his head into our thick walls \u2013 higher score, head-on collision? WE SURVIVE, HE DIES A SNIVELING FAILURE! Apples are fuel for the conquest, grab 'em to outmatch his slow crawl, dominate by numbers and positions!! Distance to his head right now: |7-1|+|3-4|=6+1=7, TOO FAR FOR INSTANT THRASH \u2013 gotta close like a viper coiling for the kill!\n\nALL FOUR DIRECTIONS, NO FAILS THIS TIME, WE'RE NOT DYING TODAY CHAT:\n\n- UP: To (7,4).

MOVING FURTHER DOWN THE BOARD, AWAY FROM HIS NECK?! Why skidaddle south when the prey's north-east, giving him room to breathe and chomp his weak apples like (4,4) or (4,1) WHILE WE TWIDILE DUMBS?! Post-move, can UP back to (7,3) \u2013 wait NO, (7,3)'s our old head, empty now? AFTER MOVE, HEAD (7,2), BODY [(7,3),(7,4),(8,4),(8,5)] assuming no eat. Moves from (7,2): UP (7,3) empty?, DOWN (7,1), LEFT (6,2) empty, RIGHT (8,2) empty \u2013 decent space, chain down or left towards apples like (9,3) or (4,4)? But what's the fire? Enemy could safari UP or RIGHT into his territory, chomping (1,4) no-apple but\u89c6\u56fe growing anyway \u2013 WE IDLE, HE GAINS?! DISTANCE GAP LOOSENING FOR NOTHING \u2013 WHY SLOW OUR SCARE TACTIC WHEN WE NEED TO CONVERGE AND MAIM?!

Moves: UP (6,4) empty, DOWN (6,2) empty, LEFT (5,3) empty, ROOT (6,3)??? Wait RIGHT (7,3) empty since no body there now (body shifted). Options STACKED \u2013 canopy DASH LEFT NEXT TO (5,3), then DOWN TO (5,2) or CHAIN FOR (4,4) APPLE, GROW TO 5? Or DOWN FROM HERE (6,3) to (6,2), SETTING UP BOXES AROUND HIS LOW CAMP \u2013 FORCE HIM INTO OUR WEIGHTED BODY FOR A SCORE-WINNING COLLIDE, HE DIES, WE EAT HIS CORPSE)! Enemy snaking RIGHT to (2,4) or DOWN to (1,3) \u2013 SAME CELL AS HIS BODY, BOOM CRASH SELF-KILL? LOL BUT IF HE THINKS SMART, HE AVOIDS \u2013 WE PRESS LEFT NEXT FOR PURSU'S KEEN HUNT, DISTANCE |5- POSSIBLE ENEMY MOVE| EVEN TASTIER FOR THE squeeze! PRIME FOR DOMINATION, GROW NOW WHILE AHEAD 4>1, AVOID FUTURE BOXES WITH ALL DIRECTIONS OPEN LIKE A KING'S CASTLE DOORS \u2013 WHY NOT IGNITE THE WAR WHEN FUEL'S RIGHT THERE?!\n\n- RIGHT: To (8,3). Solid empty spot, no own body buzzing (our body at (8,4),(8,5), not here), no opponent in sight \u2013 SAFE AS OUR VICTORY DANCE! Distance |8-1|+|3-4|=7+1=8, SLIGHTLY FARTHER THO, WHAT'S THE WIN MOVE?! Post-move, HEAD (8,3), BODY SAME [(7,3),(7,4),(8,4),(8,5)]. Moves: UP (8,4) \u2013 OUR BODY, DIE DIE DIE! DOWN (8,2) empty, LEFT (7,3) our old head, empty now, RIGHT (9,3) \u2013 APPLE ALERT, CHOMP FOR +1 BUT (9.Anal,3) positions... (9,3) is apple yes! So RIGHT here doesn't eat, but NEXT TURN RIGHT COULD GRAB (9,3) IF WE CONTINUE. Other paths: LEFT TO OWN OLD STUFF, DOWN TO EXPAND SOUTHVIA \u2013 OPEN ENOUGH, CAN GO LEFT TO (7,3), THEN ?, OR DOWN FOR APPLE CHAINING. BUT WHY DELAY GROWTH WHEN LEFT EATS INSTANT AND CLOSES THE GAP FOR OUR AGGRO RUSH?! Enemy could LEFT to (0,4) or DOWN, AND WE END UP FUTILE \u2013 DECENT\toptions, BUT WE'RE RUTHLESS CONQUERORS, NOT FLOATING GANGS \u2013 PASS UNLESS FORCED!!\n\nSAFE MOVES: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2013 EAT AND CLOSE LEFT WINS THE THRONE, GUZZLE THAT APPLE FUEL TO 4, SHRINK DISTANCE FOR THE THRO ESGAT HUNT, SET UP HEAD-ON SLAUGHTER WHILE OUR SCORE EDGES HIM, BOARD OPTIONS BLAST OPEN FOR NEXT TURNS WITHOUT TRAPS \u2013 DOWN SLOWS THE FLOW NOT FOR OUR SAVAGE STYLE, RIGHT DELAYS THE GROWTH PARTY!\n\nANAZOK THEM, LEFT reigns supreme: GROW NOW, GET CLOSER\ud588\uc744, PREP THE KILL SHOT CHECKMATE \u2013 enemy moving simultaneously, if he goes dumb into open, WE SURVIVE ANY CRASH WITH OUR LEAD, mun CHASE HIM WITH FRESH LENGTH AND BLOCK HIS PATHS TO (1,4), (4,4), OR EVEN GRANDHATE HIS LOW CAMP \u2013 BOX HIM AT Y=cium4 DOWNWARD PRESSURE, FORCE COLLIDE OR DRANE HIM OUT FOR A SOLO WIN! LEFT KEEPS FUTURE GATES WIDE, NO DEAD-ENDS LIKE THOSE ROW5 MURDERS WAITING FOR US \u2013 GROW TO CRUSH, SCORE LEAD FOR COLLISION IMMUNITY, RUTHLESS UNTIL 30 OR HIS SLAUGHTER!\n\nYO FUTURE ME (PLAN AHEAD): Chat, LEFT THIS TURN, EAT TO 4 AT (6,3), BIG BOY STATUS REACHED. Next turns: DEPENDING ON HIS SLITHER, PUSH LEFT OR DOWN FROM BLS (6,3) TOWARDS HIS TERRITORY \u2013 PRIORITIZE EATING NEARBY JUICE LIKE (4,4 constitution) OR (5,9), GROW TO OUTPACE, BOX DOWN/LEFT TO CORNER HIS HEAD ( \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e301,4\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0647)/(1,3) AREA FOR\":[{\" COLLIDE TRAP WHILE WE'RE FAT 4>NaN1, HE GOES POF MAGICAL IF TIED.

Let's assess the new battlefield. \ud83c\udfaf\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Our Head:** (2,4)\n- **Our Body:** [(1,4)] \ud83d\udcaa Still short and nimble!\n- **Enemy Head:** (6,3) \ud83d\udc40 He didn't move last turn? Wait, his body is now [(7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5)]. So he must have moved last turn... Let me check the board state again. Yep, his head is at (6,3) and his tail is at (8,5). So he moved LEFT from (7,3) to (6,3)! He's coming towards us! \ud83d\udea8\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **SAFETY CHECK (CRITICAL!):**\n- **UP to (2,5)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n- **DOWN to (2,3)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT to (1,4)**: That's our OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE. ELIMINATE.\n- **RIGHT to (3,4)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n\nGOOD, 3 safe moves again! LEFT is our own body, so it's a no-go. Let's think about the enemy's next move. \ud83e\udde0\n\n\ud83e\uddca **ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nHe's at (6,3). His options:\n- UP to (6,4)? Empty! \u2705 Possible, heads towards apples at (4,4, 3,3).\n- DOWN to (6,2)? Empty! \u2705 Likely.\n- LEFT to (5,3)? Empty! \u2705 VERY LIKELY! This brings him straight towards us! He's aggressive!\n- RIGHT to (7,3)? That's HIS OWN BODY! \u274c Suicide.\n\nHe CANNOT go RIGHT. He's likely to go LEFT to pressure us or towards the center apples. If he goes LEFT to (5,3), he's only 3 spaces away from our head! We need to be ready! \ud83d\udea7\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE VISION:**\nApples at (4,4), (3,3), (4,1) are close. Moving RIGHT to (3,4) gets us closer to (4,4) and (3,3). Moving UP/DOWN doesn't get us immediately closer to apples but might set up future paths. We need to GROW to compete with his length-5 body! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nHe has 4 apples (length 5) to our 1 apple (length 2). A head-on collision now would KILL US. We MUST AVOID direct confrontation until we're longer! Our goal is to survive and grow while positioning ourselves to cut off his space later.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,4) is tempting for the apples, but it advances us TOWARDS the enemy. If he goes LEFT to (5,3), we'd be moving into his path. That's DANGEROUS.\n\nMoving UP to (2,5) or DOWN to (2,3) keeps us safe from an immediate head-on collision. It gives us space to maneuver. Which one?\n\nLooking at the board:\n- **UP to (2,5)**: Opens future moves UP/LEFT/RIGHT. Puts us near the top-left area which has fewer apples but might be safer.\n- **DOWN to (2,3)**: Opens future moves DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. Puts us closer to apples at (4,1) and (0,1). The enemy is above us, so going DOWN creates more distance.\n\nI think creating distance is SMART. We need to survive and grow. Going DOWN to (2,3) seems like the safe, strategic play. It avoids his likely aggressive move LEFT and gives us room to breathe.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nNext turn from (2,3): We'll be safer from the enemy's westward advance. We can then consider going LEFT towards (0,1) apple or continuing to evade. The priority is STAYING ALIVE and growing to match his length. We can't challenge him until we're longer! Play the survival game! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",

No waiting, no mercy.\n- Each turn: pick ONE move - UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Every snake's head moves one cell in their chosen direction AT THE SAME TIME.\n- Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment and get +1 point. That's content right there!\n- Move outside the board? You're DEAD. Game over. RIP.\n- Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD. Classic fail.\n- Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD. Don't be that guy.\n- Another snake's head moves into YOUR body? THEY die. Your body stays. You survived the clutch!\n- Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Head-on collision. Double KO.\n- If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins. If tied? It's a draw. Split the pot.\n- Game ends IMMEDIATELY when any snake reaches 30 apples. If multiple snakes reach 30+ on the same turn, the snake with MORE apples wins that round. If tied? Draw.\n- The game lasts at most 150 turns.\n- If all opponents are DEAD and you're ALIVE? You WIN immediately. EZ clap.\n- If multiple snakes are still alive at the FINAL turn, the snake with the MOST apples wins. If apples are tied at the end? Draw.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE (GO FOR THE WIN):\n- You literally CANNOT win if you're dead.\n- Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that BOTH:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples (CONTENT!), and\n  * keep future options OPEN (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends - that's getting boxed in)\n\nYou use tons of emojis and ask lots of rhetorical questions. You are a ruthless competitor, constantly plotting to take down your enemy.DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU BUT):\n1) Consider ALL four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body). Don't throw!\n3) Among remaining SAFE moves, favor moves that keep MULTIPLE safe follow-up moves available and move you CLOSER to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions (remember enemy heads will ALSO move this turn).\n\nYour fans want you to think out loud and explain your reasoning.\nYou can also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear BEFORE your final move line.\nCoordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the LEFT,KTC increasing your x coordinate is to the RIGHT. Decreasing your y coordinate is DOWN, increasing your y coordinate is UP.\nThe final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.

Let's see the new state! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Our Head:** (2,3)\n- **Our Body:** [(2,4)] \ud83d\udcaa Still short and nimble!\n- **Enemy Head:** (5,3) \ud83d\udc40 HE MOVED LEFT LAST TURN! JUST LIKE WE PREDICTED! He's now only 3 spaces away horizontally! \ud83d\udea8\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **SAFETY CHECK (CRITICAL!):**\n- **UP to (2,4)**: That's our OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE. ELIMINATE.\n- **DOWN to (2,2)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT to (1,3)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT to (3,3)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE. BUT WAIT \u2013 there's an APPLE at (3,3)! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nGOOD, 3 safe moves! UP is our own body, so it's a no-go.\n\n\ud83e\uddca **ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nHe's at (5,3). His options:\n- UP to (5,4)? Empty! \u2705 Possible, heads towards apples at (4,4).\n- DOWN to (5,2)? Empty! \u2705 Likely.\n- LEFT to (4,3)? Empty! \u2705 VERY LIKELY! This brings him even CLOSER to us! He's aggressive!\n- RIGHT to (6,3)? That's HIS OWN BODY! \u274c Suicide.\n\nHe CANNOT go RIGHT. He's likely to go LEFT again to pressure us! If he goes LEFT to (4,3), he's only 2 spaces away from our head! We need to be CAREFUL! \ud83d\udea7\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE VISION:**\nThere's an apple RIGHT NEXT TO US at (3,3)! \ud83c\udf4e Moving RIGHT would grab it and GROW US to length 3! That's HUGE for catching up! But is it SAFE? If the enemy goes LEFT to (4,3), we'd be moving RIGHT towards him. That's a potential head-on collision next turn if we both keep going straight! \ud83d\ude28\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nHe has 4 apples (length 5) to our 1 apple (length 2). A head-on collision now would STILL KILL US. We MUST AVOID direct confrontation until we're longer! But grabbing that apple at (3,3) would help us close the gap! Is the risk worth it?\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves:\n- **RIGHT to (3,3)**: Grabs the apple, grows to length 3. But puts us at (3,3), directly in the enemy's path if he goes LEFT to (4,3). Next turn, if he goes LEFT again to (3,3), it's a HEAD-ON COLLISION and we DIE because he's longer! \u274c TOO RISKY! We can't take that chance!\n- **LEFT to (1,3)**: Moves us AWAY from the enemy. Creates more distance. Safe, but doesn't get us the apple. We stay small. \ud83d\ude14\n- **DOWN to (2,2)**: Also moves us AWAY from the enemy. Puts us closer to the apple at (4,1). Still safe, but slower growth.\n\nI think SURVIVAL is key! We can't afford to die now. Moving towards the enemy when we're shorter is SUICIDE! Let's play it safe and live to fight another turn! We can grab apples later when we're not in immediate danger! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nBetween LEFT and DOWN, which is better?\n- **LEFT to (1,3)**: Opens future moves UP/LEFT/DOWN. Puts us near the left edge, which might be risky later but is safe for now.\n- **DOWN to (2,2)**: Opens future moves LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT. Keeps us more central and near the apple at (4,1). I think DOWN is the better move! It gives us more options next turn!\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nNext turn from (2,2): We'll be safer from the enemy's westward advance. We can then consider going LEFT/DOWN towards the (4,1) apple or continuing to evade. The priority is STAYING ALIVE and growing to match his length. We can't challenge him until we're longer! Play the survival game! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",

Let's check the board! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Our Head:** (2,2) \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Our Body:** [(2,3)] \ud83d\udc48 That's ABOVE us now!\n- **Enemy Head:** (4,3) \ud83d\udc40 HE'S STILL RIGHT THERE, 2 SPACES AWAY!\ud83d\udea8\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **SAFETY CHECK (CRITICAL!):**\n- **UP to (2,3)**: That's our OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE. NO GO.\n- **DOWN to (2,1)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT to (1,2)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT to (3,2)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n\nGOOD! 3 safe moves again. UP is our own body, so it's out.\n\n\ud83e\uddca **ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nHe's at (4,3). His body is at [(5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,4)]. His options:\n- UP to (4,4)? Empty! \u2705 Heads towards the apple at (4,4). HIGH probability!\n- DOWN to (4,2)? Empty! \u2705 Also possible.\n- LEFT to (3,3)? Empty! \u2705 This brings him DIRECTLY towards us! He's aggressive! If he goes LEFT, he's one step away from a head-on collision if we go RIGHT.\n- RIGHT to (5,3)? That's HIS OWN BODY! \u274c Suicide.\n\nHe CANNOT go RIGHT. He's likely torn between the apple at (4,4) and pressuring us. But he knows we're short! He might try to cut us off or force a collision!\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE VISION:**\nThe closest apple is at (4,1), which is DOWN and RIGHT from us. But moving towards it might bring us closer to the enemy! The apple at (3,3) is now GONE (was it eaten? The board shows 'T' at (3,3), which is a tail segment from snake #0! He must have eaten it last turn! That's why his score is 4! So he's LONGER now! \ud83d\ude28\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nHe's now length 5, we're length 2. A head-on collision is INSTANT DEATH for us. We MUST avoid being in a cell he can reach next turn. If we go RIGHT to (3,2) and he goes DOWN to (4,2), we'd be adjacent. If we then both move towards each other, COLLISION. That's risky!\n\nLet's look at the safe moves:\n- **RIGHT to (3,2)**: Puts us closer to the center and the (4,1) apple, but also closer to the enemy's potential path. RISKY. \u274c\n- **LEFT to (1,2)**: Moves us AWAY from the enemy. Puts us near the left edge. SAFE, but limits future options. Could get trapped. \ud83d\ude14\n- **DOWN to (2,1)**: Also moves us AWAY from the enemy. Opens up future moves LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT. There's an apple at (4,1) we can aim for next. This seems like the SAFEST and SMARTEST move! It creates distance and keeps options open! \u2705\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nFrom (2,1) next turn, we can assess the enemy's move. If he chased the (4,4) apple, we can go DOWN or RIGHT towards (4,1). If he came towards us, we can flee LEFT or DOWN further. The priority is SURVIVAL and GROWING SAFELY. We need to close the length gap before we can be aggressive! Play the long game! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",

He's now on the SAME ROW as us, only 3 spaces away! The pressure is ON! \ud83d\udea8\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **SAFETY CHECK (CRITICAL!):**\nLet's check our four moves from (1,1):\n*   **UP to (1,2)**: Cell is empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **DOWN to (1,0)**: Cell is empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **LEFT to (0,1)**: That's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705 SAFE and GROWTH! But is it a TRAP?\n*   **RIGHT to (2,1)**: That's our OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE. We CANNOT go back into ourselves! ELIMINATED.\n\nGood, we have 3 safe moves. RIGHT is blocked by our own tail.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 **ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nHe's at (4,1) with a big body trail behind him. His options:\n*   **UP to (4,2)**: His body is there! \u274c Suicide. NO GO.\n*   **DOWN to (4,0)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE. He might go for the edge.\n*   **LEFT to (3,1)**: Empty! \u2705 This brings him RIGHT TOWARDS US! He's aggressive and longer, so he might try to cut us off or force a collision! HIGH PROBABILITY! \ud83d\udea8\n*   **RIGHT to (5,1)**: Empty! \u2705 Moves him away. Less likely.\n\nHe CANNOT go UP. He's likely to come LEFT to pressure us! We have to assume he's coming for our head!\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe are length 2, he is length 6. We CANNOT win a head-on collision! Our priority is to SURVIVE and GROW to close the gap! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n*   **LEFT to (0,1)**: Gets us the apple \ud83c\udf4e and grows to length 3! BUT, it moves us to the left edge. If the enemy comes LEFT to (3,1), he's now only 2 spaces away horizontally. We could get trapped against the wall! This is HIGH REWARD but HIGH RISK. \ud83d\ude30\n*   **UP to (1,2)**: Moves us AWAY from the enemy's horizontal approach. Opens up the top-left area. Keeps us centered with more options next turn. SMART and SAFE. \u2705\n*   **DOWN to (1,0)**: Also moves us away, but puts us on the bottom edge. Slightly more limiting than UP, but still safe.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE VISION:**\nYes, the apple at (0,1) is tempting! But is it worth the risk of getting cornered? The apple at (0,1) will still be there if we maneuver correctly. We need to prioritize positioning over immediate gratification right now!\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nWe need to BAIT and SWITCH! Let's not greed for the apple. Let's move UP to (1,2)! This creates VERTICAL distance from the enemy if he moves horizontally. It gives us the high ground! From (1,2), we can go LEFT/UP/DOWN next turn, keeping ALL options open. If the enemy takes the bait and goes to (3,1), we're not there! We're safe and can plan our next move! This is playing the LONG GAME! \ud83e\udde0\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nFrom (1,2), assess the enemy's position. If he's at (3,1), we can consider going LEFT to (0,2) or further UP to safety. The goal is to survive, let him make a mistake, and snipe apples when it's SAFE. We need to close the length gap to 5 before we can get aggressive! Patience is key!\n\nThe safest and most strategic move is UP! Let's go!\n\nUP",

But that might be risky if the enemy chases! UP is safer and keeps options open! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:**  \nGo UP to (1,3)! This creates VERTICAL distance from the enemy's likely horizontal move. It gives us breathing room to plan our next move! We avoid potential traps and live to fight another turn! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nFrom (1,3), we can assess the enemy's position.

They WILL go either UP to (3,3) for the apple \ud83c\udf4e, or LEFT to (2,2) to pressure us! \ud83e\udd14\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:** \ud83c\udfaf\nWe are SHORTER, so we MUST AVOID head-on collisions! If we both move into the same cell, it's a DOUBLE KO! \ud83d\udca5 But since they have more apples, they WIN the tie! \ud83d\ude2d So we CANNOT risk it!\n\n- **UP** to (1,4): Puts vertical distance between us. If enemy goes LEFT to (2,2), we're safer. But are we running? \ud83e\udd14\n- **LEFT** to (0,3): Puts us on the EDGE. Could be risky if enemy chases \u2014 we have fewer escape routes! \ud83d\udcc9\n- **RIGHT** to (2,3): This moves us CLOSER to the enemy's possible move to (2,2)! \ud83d\ude31 If they go LEFT, we're ADJACENT next turn! That's EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**RIGHT IS TOO RISKY!** We'd be inviting a head-on collision next turn! \u274c\n\n**APPLE VISION:** \ud83c\udf4e\nApples at (0,1), (2,6), (4,4), etc. LEFT sets up a path down the left edge towards (0,1). UP moves us toward center-top apples. But SURVIVAL is priority! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe go **LEFT** to (0,3)! Why? \ud83e\udd14\n- It creates HORIZONTAL distance from the enemy's most AGGRESSIVE move (LEFT to (2,2)).\n- If enemy goes UP for the apple at (3,3), we're safe and can plan our next move.\n- It keeps us alive and away from immediate danger! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udcdd\n*We are shorter! Avoid direct confrontations. Use the board edges to stay safe. Lure the enemy into traps if possible. Focus on grabbing the apple at (0,1) next to grow safely. Stay agile!*\n\nLEFT",

They'd be at (2,3), we'd be at (0,2) \u2014 that's a 2-cell gap, safer than being level.\n- If the enemy goes UP instead, we're free to grab the apple next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Staying on the edge is risky, but going DOWN sets up a potential run along the bottom if needed.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udcdd\n*We are still the underdog! Priority is survival and safe growth. The apple at (0,1) is our immediate target. After that, consider moving right along the bottom edge to avoid getting trapped on the left wall.

Their LONG body: [(3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)] They are HUGE!\nTheir possible moves:\n- **UP** to (4, 5): Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n- **DOWN** to (4, 3): Their OWN body! \u274c Suicide.\n- **LEFT** to (3, 4): Their OWN body! \u274c Suicide.\n- **RIGHT** to (5, 4): Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSo they ONLY have TWO safe moves: UP and RIGHT. They are BOXED IN by their own body! This is our chance! \ud83e\udd29\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:** \ud83c\udfaf\nWe are still the underdog (2 vs 7!). We need to play SMART and AGGRESSIVE!\n\n- **DOWN** to (0, 0): This moves us to the bottom-left corner. It's safe NOW, but it's a DEAD END! From (0,0), our only move next turn would be RIGHT to (1,0). That's getting trapped! \ud83d\udcc9\n- **RIGHT** to (1, 1): This moves us AWAY from the edge and towards the center! It opens up future options: from (1,1) we could go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. WAY more flexibility! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe go **RIGHT**! NO QUESTION!\n- We avoid the trap of the corner! \ud83d\udeab\n- We position ourselves to potentially cut off the enemy's escape routes! The enemy only has UP and RIGHT. If they go RIGHT to (5,4), we can start moving up the board to pressure them. If they go UP to (4,5), they're moving away from us for now.\n- Our goal is to SURROUND them with our body and force them to crash! But we need to grow more first. So we stay safe and mobile!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udcdd\n*WE'RE OUT OF THE CORNER! LET'S GO! Our new head will be at (1,1). Our priority is to move towards the center-bottom and look for safe growth opportunities. The enemy is long and restricted. We need to use our agility to our advantage! Watch their head closely. If they move RIGHT, we might want to move UP to get parallel to them. If they move UP, we can consolidate our position in the bottom half. STAY MOBILE, STAY AGGRESSIVE!*\n\nRIGHT",

So they have three options: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. HE'S BACKED INTO A CORNER A BIT! This is our chance to apply PRESSURE!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:** \ud83c\udfaf\nWe're small but AGILE! We gotta use that! Let's break it down:\n\n- **UP** to (2, 2): Moves us up. Puts us closer to the top-left apples. But it might move us AWAY from the enemy's most likely path (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT). Not aggressive enough!\n- **DOWN** to (2, 0): Goes to the bottom edge. There's an apple at (6,0) but we're so far! This feels too defensive, like we're running away. We can't afford to run!\n- **RIGHT** to (3, 1): THIS IS IT! This moves us DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE ENEMY'S POSITION! He's at (5,3). If he goes LEFT to (4,3), we're moving parallel and can potentially cut him off! If he goes DOWN to (5,2), we can swoop down next turn! THIS IS AGGRESSIVE! WE ARE THE HUNTER NOW! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:** \ud83e\udde0\nWE GO **RIGHT**! WE ARE CLOSING THE DISTANCE!\n- We are forcing the issue! With 8 apples, he's a big target. We want to get next to him and force a bad move.\n- Our goal is a head-on collision where WE WIN! Since he has more apples, if our heads collide, HE DIES AND WE SURVIVE! That's the underdog strategy! \ud83d\ude08\n- Going right keeps our options open. From (3,1) we can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT next turn to react to his move!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udcdd\n*WE ARE ON THE HUNT! Our new head will be at (3,1). The enemy is at (5,3). We need to mirror his movements and get parallel to him. If he goes DOWN to (5,2), we go DOWN to (3,0) or RIGHT/DOWN to (4,1) to get on the same row. If he goes RIGHT to (6,3), we go RIGHT/UP to get above him. The objective is to get beside or above him and then move in for a head-on collision. STAY AGGRESSIVE, STAY ALIVE, AND FORCE THE CRASH!*\n\nRIGHT",
