This could give me a better chance of getting one of those apples, but it also puts me in a more vulnerable position if the enemy snake is moving towards me.\n\nI also notice that there's an apple at position (0, 8) that's relatively far away from the enemy snake. If I move down and then right, I could potentially get to that apple without running into the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy: I think I'll try to move down and then right to get closer to the apple at position (0, 8).
