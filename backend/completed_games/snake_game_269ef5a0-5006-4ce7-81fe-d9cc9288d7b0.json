If I continue RIGHT, I'll be at (7, 4). This doesn't get me any closer to the apple at (5,5). If I move UP, I will be at (6, 5) which is closer to the apple. If I move DOWN I will be at (6, 3).\n\nLet's consider Snake 1's movement. It is at (6,2). My head is at (6,4). Snake 1 is *below* me. If Snake 1 moves UP, it can potentially block me from going DOWN, so the apple at (5,2) will be unavailable. If Snake 1 moves RIGHT down, then I can go UP and hopefully avoid this snake.\n\nThe easiest strategy is still to prioritize the (5,5) apple. It's close and valuable.\n\nUP\n\nUP",
