If I move DOWN to (6,8), there's no immediate collision risk.\n\n2. **Apple Access**: \n   - (6,7) is closest to me at 2 cells away - I can reach it in 2 moves\n   - (6,4) is 5 cells away - enemy can reach it in 1 move\n   - (4,7) and (4,6) are on the left side\n   - (2,0) is far away\n\n3. **Movement Options**: \n   - DOWN keeps me close to the (6,7) apple and maintains flexibility\n   - LEFT moves towards (4,6) and (4,7) apples but requires more travel\n   - RIGHT moves away from all nearby apples\n\n## Short-term Plan\nMove DOWN to (6,8) to position myself closer to the (6,7) apple. This maintains flexibility for future moves while getting me closer to the most accessible apple. From (6,8), I can easily move DOWN again to collect the (6,7) apple on the next turn if it's still available.\n\nDOWN",
