Actually, the enemy body is at (0,2), not (1,2). So (1,2) should be free.\n\nSo move RIGHT to (2,1) then UP to (2,2) should be safe.\n\nAlso moving UP immediately could be useful, but since I'm at (1,1), going UP is possible.\n\nIs (1,2) occupied? The enemy snake is at (0,3) and body at (0,2), so (1,2) is empty.\n\nTherefore, move UP is safe.\n\nBut I also want to get closer to the left side (x=0) where apples at y=6,8 are.\n\nMoving LEFT from (1,1) to (0,1) is valid and safe.\n\nBut last time we said moving LEFT from (0,1) to (-1,1) is invalid.\n\nAt (1,1) I can move LEFT to (0,1).\n\nAt (0,1), moving UP to (0,2) is blocked by enemy.\n\nSo alternative is to initially move LEFT from (1,1) to (0,1), then decide how to bypass the enemy.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT from (1,1) to (2,1) is safe.\n\nI think taking the LEFT move now gets me closer to apples (0,6), (0,8).\n\nFrom (0,1), I can try to find a path around the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, going RIGHT to (2,1), then UP to (2,2), and then to (2,9) apple might be another good route.\n\nApple at (2,9) is up high and along x=2, so a straight path by going UP from (2,1) could lead to the apple.\n\nNo enemy body is currently around x=2.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT puts me on route to an unblocked path to (2,9).\n\nSo planning:\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2,1)\n\n- Then UP towards (2,9)\n\nThis avoids the enemy snake blocking the x=0 column.\n\nHence, next move: RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turns: Continue UP after reaching (2,1) to get to (2,9) apple, then possibly go for apples on the right side like (8,3), (8,5) or circle back to apples on x=0 side.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"
