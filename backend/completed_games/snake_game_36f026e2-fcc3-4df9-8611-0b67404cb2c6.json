Since it's just below me, I can move down to get it. However, I should also be cautious of the enemy snake #2, as it's nearby and could potentially block my path or attack me.\n\nFor now, I'll focus on getting the apple. I'll move down to (8, 6) and then reassess the situation.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on enemy snake #2 and plan a route to avoid it while also considering other apples on the board.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
