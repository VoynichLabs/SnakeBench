            "rationale": "# Analysis\n\nLet me analyze my current situation and available moves:\n\n- My head is at (4, 9) with body at [(5, 9), (5, 8)]\n- There are apples at (4, 6), (3, 9), (2, 3), (2, 2), (0, 1)\n- The enemy snake #2 is at (3, 8) with no body segments\n\n## Possible moves:\n- UP: Would hit the wall at y=10, so I'd die\n- DOWN: Safe, would move to (4, 8)\n- LEFT: Would move to (3, 9), collecting an apple immediately\n- RIGHT: Would move to (5, 9), where my body segment currently is, so I'd die\n\n## Best move analysis\nThe LEFT move is clearly optimal as it lets me immediately collect the apple at (3, 9). This will grow my snake by 1 segment.\n\nAfter that, I'll need to plan a path toward another apple. The closest would be the one at (4, 6), which would require me to move DOWN from my future position.\n\nI should be cautious of the enemy snake at (3, 8) which is just below where I'll be after moving LEFT. However, since I'll have just eaten an apple, I'll have grown longer, so my body will include (4, 9), (5, 9), and (5, 8). This means that after moving LEFT, I won't be able to move DOWN immediately as the enemy snake is there, so I'll need to move LEFT again to (2, 9) to avoid collision.\n\nLEFT"
