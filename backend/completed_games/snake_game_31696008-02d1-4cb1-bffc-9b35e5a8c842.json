Looking at my body positions [(9, 4), (9, 5)], I can see I now have a length of 3 (head at (8,4) plus 2 body segments).\n\nCurrent apples remaining: (0, 5), (1, 9), (6, 7), (7, 2), (1, 2)\n\nLet me check my movement options:\n- UP: Would move to (8, 5) - this looks safe, no obstacles\n- DOWN: Would move to (8, 3) - this looks safe too\n- LEFT: Would move to (7, 4) - safe\n- RIGHT: Would move to (9, 4) - DEATH! That's where my body segment is\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2, 8) with body at [(2, 7)] - still far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nNow I need to think strategically about which apple to target next:\n- (7, 2): This is relatively close, I could go DOWN then LEFT to approach it\n- (6, 7): This would require going UP and LEFT \n- (0, 5): This is far but at the same Y level as one of my body segments\n- (1, 9): Very far, would take many moves\n- (1, 2): Also quite far\n\nI think the apple at (7, 2) is the most logical next target since it's closest. To get there efficiently, I should start moving DOWN to decrease my Y coordinate from 4 to 2.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving toward (7, 2) apple, likely by moving LEFT once I'm at the right Y level, while staying aware of my growing body length and the enemy snake's movements.\n\nDOWN"
