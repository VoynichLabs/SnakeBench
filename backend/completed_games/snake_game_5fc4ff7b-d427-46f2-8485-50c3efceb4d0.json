Apples remain at (5,7), (6,0), (5,0), (1,4), (9,5).\n2. **Primary Goal:** Reach (1,4) efficiently while avoiding the enemy. The path to (1,4) is:\n   - (2,0) \u2192 UP \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 UP \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 LEFT \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 LEFT \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 LEFT \u2192 (1,4).\n   However, this is inefficient.

It could move toward (0,6), (0,4), (1,5), or (-1,5) (invalid). If it moves toward (1,5), it might block my path to (1,4).

I\u2019ll prioritize (1,4) because it\u2019s reachable in fewer moves and less contested.\n5. **Risk Mitigation:** From (2,0), moving UP to (2,1) is safe and sets me up to move UP again to (2,2). From there, I can move LEFT to (1,2) or RIGHT to (3,2). LEFT is better to get closer to (1,4).\n6. **Future Moves:** After reaching (2,2), I can move LEFT to (1,2), then LEFT to (1,3), then LEFT to (1,4). This path avoids the enemy\u2019s potential path and keeps me flexible.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Current State (Turn 4):**\n- **My Position:** Head at (2,0), body at [(1,0)].\n- **Apples:** (1,4) is 4 moves away via UP \u2192 UP \u2192 LEFT \u2192 LEFT.\n- **Enemy:** Still at (0,5).

Enemy (#0) is still at (0,5). Apples remain at (5,0), (6,0), (5,7).\n2. **Primary Goal:** Secure the apple at (5,0). From (5,5), the safest path is **DOWN** \u2192 **LEFT** \u2192 **LEFT** \u2192 **DOWN**. Snake #0 is still at (0,5), but it could move toward (0,4) or (1,5) in the next turn.\n3. **Enemy Tracking:** Snake #0 is still at (0,5). If it moves to (0,4), it could threaten my path to (5,0) later, but not immediately. If it moves to (1,5), it could block my path to (5,0) if I try to go through (1,5).\n4. **Apple Prioritization:** The apple at (5,0) is still the closest reachable apple. From (5,5), moving **DOWN** to (4,5) is safe, but I need to ensure Snake #0 doesn\u2019t block my path.\n5. **Risk Mitigation:** Moving **DOWN** to (4,5) is safe, but I need to plan a path to (5,0) while avoiding Snake #0. If Snake #0 moves toward (1,5), it could threaten my path to (5,0) later.\n6. **Future Moves:** After reaching (5,0), I will need to plan a path to (5,7) or other remaining apples while keeping an eye on Snake #0\u2019s movements. I should also consider moving toward (6,0) if it becomes a better option.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Current State (Turn 22):**\n- **My Position:** Head at (5,5), body at [(6,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,0)].\n- **Apples:** (5,0) is still reachable but requires careful path planning. From (5,5), moving **DOWN** to (4,5) is safe, but I need to avoid Snake #0.\n- **Enemy:** Still at (0,5). No immediate threat to my path to (5,0).\n- **Safe Moves from (5,5):**\n  1. **DOWN**: (5,5) \u2192 (4,5) (safe, keeps me on a path toward (5,0)).\n  2. **UP**: (5,5) \u2192 (6,5) (safe, but moves me away from (5,0)).\n  3. **LEFT**: (5,5) \u2192 (4,5) (same as DOWN, but not helpful).\n  4. **RIGHT**: (5,5) \u2192 (5,6) (safe, but moves me away from (5,0)).\n\n- **Best Move:** **DOWN** to (4,5). This keeps me on a direct route toward (5,0) while avoiding immediate threats. From (4,5), I can continue planning my path to (5,0) while monitoring Snake #0\u2019s movements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:**\nDOWN",

Safe.\n   - DOWN: (1,6) \u2192 On board, not into my body, not into enemy body. Safe.\n   - LEFT: (0,7) \u2192 On board, not into my body, not into enemy body. Safe.\n   - RIGHT: (2,7) \u2192 Into my own body (first segment), death.\n\n3) Safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\n4) Apple proximity:\n   - (4,3) is at Manhattan distance 7 (DOWN x4 + RIGHT x3)\n   - (5,0) is at distance 8 (DOWN x7 + RIGHT x4)\n   - (9,5) is at distance 10 (RIGHT x8 + DOWN x2)\n   - (6,9) is at distance 7 (UP x2 + RIGHT x5)\n   - (4,9) is at distance 5 (UP x2 + RIGHT x3)\n\n5) Enemy movement considerations:\n   - Enemy snake at (6,0) with body at (6,1), (6,2). Their possible moves:\n     - UP: (6,1) \u2192 Into their own body, death.\n     - DOWN: (6,-1) \u2192 Off the board, death.\n     - LEFT: (5,0) \u2192 Safe, and would eat an apple.\n     - RIGHT: (7,0) \u2192 Safe.\n   - Most likely moves: LEFT or RIGHT.\n   - If they move LEFT to (5,0), they will eat an apple and grow, becoming more dangerous.\n   - If they move RIGHT to (7,0), they move away from my path but stay near the bottom.\n   - The enemy is currently far from my snake, so immediate collision risk is low.\n\n6) Long-term plan:\n   - The closest apple is (4,9) at distance 5. Moving UP to (1,8) is a step toward this apple.\n   - Moving LEFT to (0,7) would trap me against the wall, limiting future options.\n   - Moving DOWN to (1,6) moves me away from all apples and toward the enemy's potential path, which is risky.\n   - After moving UP to (1,8), I can continue moving UP or RIGHT to reach (4,9) or (6,9).\n   - The top-right corner has two apples (6,9) and (4,9), which are relatively safe to target.\n   - Avoid moving LEFT to prevent getting trapped in the corner.\n   - The enemy is likely to eat the apple at (5,0) if they move LEFT, so I should focus on the top-right apples to stay ahead in score.\n\nUP",
