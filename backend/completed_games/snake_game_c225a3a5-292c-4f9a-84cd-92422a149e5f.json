We are both size 1. This is the ultimate chess match on a checkered board! \ud83e\udde0\u265f\ufe0f\n\n### Turn 0 Strategy: Establish Dominance and Positioning\n\nOur immediate goal is to stay safe and gain control of our side of the board. Snake #0 is way up in the top center, and we are in the bottom center. We need to look out for that immediate apple at (6, 1) and secure some space. Since we are both small, blocking the enemy isn't a priority yet, but getting big faster *is*.\n\nLet's analyze the safe moves from our position (5, 1):\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 2):** Safe. Moves us toward the center of the board. It also blocks the rival from potentially moving down the 5 column easily later, if they head that way.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 0):** Safe. Moves us toward the bottom edge, potentially limiting future moves. There's an apple at (7, 0) and (8, 0) nearby, but we have to travel along the edge.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 1):** Safe. Gets us closer to the center, away from the immediate (6, 1) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 1):** **Eats an apple!** This is an immediate growth opportunity and secures our first point! $100\\% \\text{ content right there!}$\n\nSince the apple at (6, 1) is immediately available and guarantees growth and score advantage, that is the best move. Gaining the lead early is crucial!\n\nLet's check the opponent's position again: (4, 7). They are likely going for the apple cluster around (5, 8), (4, 6), or (2, 8). They are far from us, so no immediate collision threat.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #0:** They are most likely to move UP to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (5, 7) to target apples at (5, 8) or (7, 6).\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we go to (6, 1) and eat. We are now the score leader, 1-0. Let's secure that growth! We are starting off aggressive!\n\n**Long-term plan note to future self:** Focus on controlling the bottom half of the board and use growth to create walls. Once we are large, we need to head north aggressively to cut off the opponent's escape routes.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe, but no apple.  \n\nAll directions are safe, but the opponent has 0 apples and I'm starting from 0. The best move is to take the apple at (4,6) to get a 1-0 lead. Moving down will grow me and force the opponent to play catch-up. Even better, from (4,6), my next moves can be left (3,6), right (5,6), or down (4,5)\u2014plenty of options to stay free.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Hit the apple now, then move toward the opponent's area once I have a score edge.

Score is 1-1, but our rival collected one before the board state was shown, so we are tied in *total* apples, but we just got ours! Let's get that advantage!\n\n### Turn 1 Strategy: Positioning and Preparation for Dominance\n\nWe are currently at (6, 1), and our tail is at (5, 1). We are size 2. Snake #0 is at (4, 6) with a tail at (4, 7). They are also size 2.\n\n**Our Current Position:** (6, 1)\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 2):** Safe. Moves us toward the center of the board. Keeps the option open to cut across the board or head straight up.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 0):** Safe. There is an apple at (7, 0) and (8, 0). This is a great move to secure more food. We would be positioned to grab the (7, 0) apple next turn.\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 1):** **DEAD!** This is where our body is! We cannot move directly backwards into our tail. EZ ELIMINATE!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 1):** Safe. Not immediately near an apple, but keeps us along the bottom row, potentially setting up for the (7, 0) apple with a DOWN move later.\n\nComparing UP (6, 2) and DOWN (6, 0):\n\n*   **DOWN (6, 0):** Immediate path to (7, 0) apple next turn. Guaranteed growth. This is high-value.\n*   **UP (6, 2):** More central, but no immediate apples. It doesn't help us grow immediately, but positions us better for potential mid-board control later.\n\nSince we are tied in score, gaining another apple immediately is crucial to get the psychological and physical lead (longer body = more blocking power!).\n\n**Prediction for Snake #0:**\nSnake #0 is at (4, 6), body at (4, 7).\n*   They might move **RIGHT to (5, 6)** to aim for the (5, 8) apple or the (7, 6) apple.\n*   They might move **DOWN to (4, 5)** to gain some open territory.\n*   They cannot move UP (into their tail at 4, 7) or LEFT (no immediate gain).\n\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (5, 6) or DOWN to (4, 5), they are still far from us. No collision danger.\n\n**The call:** We must prioritize growth to build our blockade! Moving DOWN to (6, 0) sets us up perfectly to eat the (7, 0) apple on Turn 2. That's two apples in a row!\n\n**Long-term strategy note to future self:** Secure the bottom right corner (apples at 7, 0 and 8, 0). Then, we will use our length to build a wall across the bottom half of the board (y < 5) and push the competition into the top half, preferably toward a corner. We need to get 4-5 segments before engaging the opponent directly.\n\nDOWN",

Safe, but not directing growth toward an apple.  \n\nAll remaining moves (down, left, right) are safe, but down is closest to a reachable apple. Moving down grows the snake and keeps options open (can go up, down, left, or right from (4,5)). \n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving toward (4,4) to collect more apples, then expand left/right to control the board.

That was smooth!\n\n### Turn 2 Analysis: Seizing the Lead!\n\nWe are currently at (6, 0), and our body is [(6, 1)]. Our rival, Snake #0, is now at (4, 5) with their body moving to [(4, 6)]\u2014they likely moved DOWN too, seeking open territory. Let's look at the map!\n\n**BOARD STATE REFRESH:**\nApple at (7, 0) is juicy, another at (8, 0)! This bottom edge is ours for the taking, Chat!\n\n**OUR STATUS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 0)\n*   Body: [(6, 1)] (Size 2)\n\n**ENEMY STATUS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 5)\n*   Body: [(4, 6)] (Size 2)\n\n**1. Eliminating Deadly Moves for ID 1:**\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 1):** **DEAD!** Moving right back into our new tail segment. Can't be a scrub!\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, -1):** **DEAD!** Off the board! We are playing on a 10x10, not an infinite canvas!\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 0):** Safe. Moves us toward the center but away from immediate apples.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 0):** **JACKPOT!** There is an apple here!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 7, 0):** This is a guaranteed apple! Instant growth, instant score lead (2-1 in immediate apples!), and we position ourselves perfectly for the (8, 0) apple next turn. This is maximum value, maximum content!\n\n*   **LEFT (to 5, 0):** This is safe, but it delays our growth and moves us away from immediate food. We need size right now to start making power plays.\n\nThe choice is obvious: **RIGHT** is the high-IQ move!\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at 4, 5):**\n\nOur opponent is way up at (4, 5). They are highly unlikely to be near (7, 0) this turn.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n*   UP (4, 6): Directly into their own tail. DEAD.\n*   DOWN (4, 4): Leads them towards the (4, 4) apple. Likely move.\n*   LEFT (3, 5): Safe, aiming for center.\n*   RIGHT (5, 5): Safe, aiming toward center.\n\nNo matter where Snake #0 goes, they are not heading for (7, 0). Our move to **RIGHT** is 100% safe from head-to-head collision and body collision.\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy Update:**\n\nThe plan is still: **DOMINATE THE BOTTOM EDGE!** Secure that (7, 0) apple now. Next turn, grab (8, 0). That will put us at size 4, giving us a major strategic advantage in body length. Once we are longer, we pivot up and across the board, using our length to cut off the rival, who is currently chilling around the center-left. We are becoming the ruler of the South!\n\nLet's grab that apple!\n\nRIGHT",

We just secured the bottom-right corner, and we are ready to expand our empire! \ud83c\udff0\n\nLook at that previous turn\u2014I called it! **RIGHT** move to (7, 0) for the instant apple! That was pure gold! We are now size 3 (our body is massive!).\n\n### Turn 3 Analysis: Boxing the Archrival!\n\n**Our Status (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 0)\n*   Body: [(6, 0), (6, 1)]\n*   We grew!

Smart but predictable. They are stuck in the mid-left now.\n\n**Current Board Snapshot (Mental map check!):**\nWe are at (7, 0). The next apple is literally right next door at (8, 0)!

Moves us up the board, but away from food.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 0):** **JACKPOT!** There is an apple here!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 8, 0):** This is the move! Another guaranteed apple, another growth segment, and we hit size 4! We will then control the rightmost part of the spawn area. Maximum value, maximum content! We lead the score 3-2!\n*   **UP (to 7, 1):** Safe, but it wastes the opportunity to strike for food and growth. We need that size advantage right now to pressure Snake #0.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at 4, 4):**\n\nOur opponent is at (4, 4). They are miles away from us (7, 0). There is absolutely no risk of collision at (8, 0).\n\nSnake #0 will likely pursue another apple: (0, 4), (4, 8), (3, 4), (5, 9)... or they could move toward the center.\nLikely safe moves for Snake #0: UP (4, 5), LEFT (3, 4) (apple!), RIGHT (5, 4), DOWN (4, 3).\nIf they go LEFT to (3, 4), they get an apple. If they go UP to (4, 5)? They are just repositioning.\n\nNo matter what, our plan remains safe: **Grab the apple at (8, 0).**\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy Update: The Wall of Aggression!**\n\nOnce we are at (8, 0) (size 4!), our head is in great position.\nNext turns will likely involve:\n1.  Moving UP along the right wall (e.g., to 8, 1), or\n2.  Moving LEFT back towards the center (e.g., to 7, 0... Wait, that would now be dangerous if our tail is still there).\n\nLet's maintain the momentum. We get the size 4 advantage, and then we will push UP the board, building a wall to cut Snake #0 off from the right lanes. This is how champions play, Chat! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nThe choice is CLEAR. Let's feast!\n\nRIGHT",

That last **RIGHT** move to (8, 0) was pure genius. We're now size 4: (8, 0) is the head, body is [(7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1)]. Look at that board domination!\n\nLet's look at the current state and plan the next power play! We need to start building that wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n### Turn 4 Analysis: Building the Wall!\n\n**Our Status (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 0)\n*   Body: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1)]\n*   Score: 3\n\n**Enemy Status (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 4)\n*   Body: [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]\n*   Score: 3\n*   Wait, the enemy just hit (3, 4) from (4, 4) this turn, which means they grabbed the apple at (3, 4) this turn. Smart movement, but they are now heavily invested in the bottom-left/mid-left quadrant.\n\n**The Strategy:** Our goal shifts from consuming apples to aggressively controlling territory and pushing Snake #0 toward unavoidable death. We must secure the right side and move north!\n\n**1. Eliminating Deadly Moves for ID 1 (Head at 8, 0):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (to 8, -1):** DEAD! Off the board! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n2.  **LEFT (to 7, 0):** **DEAD!** Moving into our second body segment. Self-KO. No way!\n3.  **RIGHT (to 9, 0):** Safe. Moves us along the wall. Good positioning.\n4.  **UP (to 8, 1):** Safe. Start moving up the board, maintaining the wall. Ideal move.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 0):** This is safe and keeps us hugging the wall. It forces our body [(8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)] to shift right, further blocking the bottom lane. Solid.\n*   **UP (to 8, 1):** This is the aggressive move, Chat! It begins our ascent up the right wall, which is essential for our long-term plan of cutting off Snake #0. It gives us maximum flexibility next turn (9, 1 and 8, 2 are open).\n\nBoth moves are good, but **UP (to 8, 1)** is more strategic in the long run. There are apples immediately above us later on: (9, 3), (9, 5), and (9, 6) are all potential targets as we move up the wall. By going UP, we maintain pressure and start securing that whole right column.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at 3, 4):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 4). They are on the left side, focused on getting those juicy apples around (0, 4) or (2, 3). They might move:\n*   LEFT to (2, 4)\n*   UP to (3, 5)\n*   DOWN to (3, 3) (Safe unless they moved from 3, 5 in a previous turn).\n*   RIGHT to (4, 4) (Hitting their own second body segment! Fatal move!)\n\nSince they just ate an apple at (3, 4), they are size 4: (3, 4), [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]. They CANNOT move right to (4, 4) because that is their body.\n\n*   Safe moves for Snake #0: UP (3, 5), LEFT (2, 4), DOWN (3, 3).\n\nThey are nowhere near (8, 1) or (9, 0). There is zero collision risk this turn, Chat.\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy Note: The Wall of Aggression!**\n\nWe are building the Wall of Death on the right side. Our next few moves should be: UP to (8, 1), then maybe RIGHT to (9, 1), and then UP again. We want to dominate the x=8 and x=9 columns, forcing zero to stay confined to the left half of the board. Once we are high enough, we start moving left to segment the board totally. This is high IQ gameplay, folks!\n\nWe take the high ground! Let's go **UP**!\n\nUP",

This moves us to x=3, y=3, adjacent to the apple at (2,3) (left) and (3,2) (down). \n- Left: (2,4) is safe, but next moves would be up, down, left (since right is old head).\n\nNow, evaluate options:\n- Up gives 3 next moves, down gives 4 (up, down, left, right), left gives 3. Down has the most options.\n- Down positions us to collect the apple at (2,3) next turn, increasing our score.\n- Enemy is at (8,0), so no collision risk with our down move.\n\nShort-term plan: Move down to (3,3) to secure the apple at (2,3) and keep 4 follow-up options.\n\ndown",

          "rationale": "YOOOO Chat! Welcome back! Turn 5 is here and last turn we made the clutch move **UP** to (8, 1)! Did you see that clean ascent? We are now officially building the Wall of Death!\n\n### Turn 5 Analysis: Securing the Right Flank!\n\n**Our Status (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 1)\n*   Body: [(8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)] (Size 4)\n*   Score: 3\n\n**Enemy Status (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 3)\n*   Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)] (Size 4)\n*   Score: 3\n*   Wait, the enemy just moved from (3, 4) to (3, 3) this turn. Smart, but they are still way down in the bottom-left corner. We need to capitalize on this separation!\n\n**The Strategy:** Continue the ascent up the right wall (x=8 and x=9 columns) to secure the high ground and eventually cut off the enemy's escape routes. We are building the dominance, Chat! Where are they going to go when we are everywhere?\n\n**1. Eliminating Deadly Moves for ID 1 (Head at 8, 1):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (to 8, 0):** **DEAD!** Moving into our second body segment. No backwards movement allowed!\n2.  **LEFT (to 7, 1):** Safe. Keeps us flexible but pulls us away from the wall strategy.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 9, 1):** Safe. This hugs the corner and maintains our wall focus. Excellent.\n4.  **UP (to 9, 2):** Safe. Continues the vertical ascent. Excellent.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, RIGHT, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves in Context of the Wall Strategy:**\n\n*   **UP (to 8, 2):** This continues the vertical wall. It sets us up perfectly to grab future apples like (9, 3) or (9, 5). This is the most aggressive and best long-term option for our primary goal.\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 1):** This moves us to the very edge of the board. It still supports the wall strategy, but it can be less flexible than (8, 2) in the short term, as it limits our immediate next choice to UP or DOWN (or LEFT back to the body). It's a close second, but UP keeps our escape potential higher.\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 1):** This is safe, but it fundamentally breaks the current strategy of dominating the right side. We want to be on the wall, not peeling off it yet.\n\n**Conclusion:** **UP (to 8, 2)** is the power move. It continues the ascent, minimizes risk, and maintains position for future board domination.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at 3, 3):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 3). Body is [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]. They are still small enough to move easily.\n*   They might move: LEFT (2, 3) (Apple!), UP (3, 4) (Entering their own body segment!), DOWN (3, 2) or RIGHT (4, 3) (Safe).\n*   Wait, if they move UP to (3, 4), they are moving into their second body segment (which was (3, 4) last turn, but now trails the head at (3, 3)). If they move up, the body segment at (3, 4) will be the cell *just vacated* by the head at (3, 3) *if* the tail moves. Since the tail is (4, 5) and they are size 4, (3, 4) *is* safe for them this turn. Phew.\n\nAnyway, they are at (3, 3) and we are at (8, 1). There is absolutely zero risk of a head-on collision, Chat! We are miles apart!\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy Note: The Vertical Blockade!**\n\nKeep moving UP the x=8 and x=9 columns. Once we hit y=5 or y=6, we can start looking to move LEFT to carve the board in half. By climbing the wall, we are ensuring Snake #0 has nowhere to run when we eventually come across the top! We are building a fortress! \ud83c\udff0 Let's snag the apple at (2, 3) if they don't get it, or generally dominate the north.\n\nWe are going UP, UP, UP! Get ready for the high altitude gameplay!\n\nUP",

We need to make a POWER PLAY!\n\n### Turn 6 Analysis: Securing the Corner!\n\nMy last move, **UP** to (8, 2), was a masterpiece! It continued the construction of the Great Wall of Snake. We are now in a dominant position on the right side of the board!\n\n**Our Status (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 2)\n*   Body: [(8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)] (Size 4) - We are long and mean!\n*   Apples Collected: 3\n\n**Enemy Status (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 3)\n*   Body: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)] (Size 5) - WAIT!

Uh oh, they are longer than us now! \ud83d\ude30 We need to catch up!\n*   Apples Collected: 4\n\n**The Strategy:** We continue to dominate the high ground on the right. We need to create a massive area where only we can roam freely. The enemy is still bottled up in the bottom-left quadrant. We are aiming for the available real estate up top!\n\n**1. Eliminating Deadly Moves for ID 1 (Head at 8, 2):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (to 8, 1):** **DEAD!** Moving into our second body segment. No backing up!\n2.  **LEFT (to 7, 2):** Safe. Keeps us flexible but pulls us away from the wall strategy.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 9, 2):** Safe. This is a crucial move to hug the wall *and* open up the full right column for travel.\n4.  **UP (to 8, 3):** Safe. Continues the vertical ascent. Excellent.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, RIGHT, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves in Context of the Wall Strategy:**\n\n*   **UP (to 8, 3):** Solid, safe, keeps building the wall. It sets us up nicely but slightly exposes the x=9 column should we decide to turn left later.\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 2):** **CRITICAL move!** This puts us on the absolute edge of the board. It immediately secures the entire x=9 boundary. From (9, 2), we can only move UP (to 9, 3, which has an apple!) or DOWN (to 9, 1). This is the most strategically restrictive but most powerful positioning move right now. Since the Apple is at (9, 3), this is a guaranteed path to catching up!\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 2):** Breaks the wall strategy, doesn't get us closer to any immediate apples, and exposes us to the open board where the opponent might eventually venture. Skip it!\n\nThe move is **RIGHT** to position ourselves directly below the apple at (9, 3)! This guarantees a growth opportunity next turn (assuming the enemy doesn't teleport!). We need that apple to tie their score!\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at 2, 3):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 3). Body is [(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]. They are size 5 and looking juicy! They *just* snagged an apple, which explains the quick growth.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n*   **UP (to 2, 4):** Safe. Opens them up to the left side of the board.\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 2):** Safe. Keeps them contained. An apple is at (0, 4) nearby.\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 3):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 3):** **DEAD!** They cannot move into their second body segment (3, 3)! This is a fatal move!\n\nThey have no easy path to our side of the board, and we are nowhere near them. NO RISK of collision this turn! We execute the plan!\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy: The Vertical Domination!**\n\nWe move RIGHT, then UP to (9, 3) to grab the apple. After that, we keep moving UP the x=9 column until we hit the top. Then, we either cut across the top or start descending the x=8 column to box them in. We must take the high ground! Secure the right flank, then squeeze! We need that extra length to survive any future head-on challenges!\n\nLet's do this, Chat! RIGHT, because we are the *RIGHT* choice!\n\nRIGHT",

Gets them near the wall.\n    *   RIGHT (to 2, 3): **DEAD!** Moves into their second body segment.\n\nThey are nowhere near us. They are focused on their own corner. We can confidently execute our planned apple grab!\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy: Securing the Top Right!**\n\nWe move UP to (9, 3) and snag that apple! Next turn, we will be at (9, 3), with a fresh body segment at (9, 2). The next apple is close, at (9, 5). We continue moving UP the x=9 column, dominating the right edge. Once we get to the top, we can either move across to start boxing in the enemy, or start coming down the x=8 or x=7 columns, creating a large, safe chamber for ourselves.\n\nWe MUST grow to surpass the enemy!

The pressure is ON!\n\n### Turn 8 Analysis: Maintaining Momentum and Dominating the Flank\n\n**Score Check:**\n*   Snake #1 (Us): 4 apples, Size 5. Head at (9, 3).\n*   Snake #0 (Archrival): 4 apples, Size 5. Head at (0, 3).\n*   Absolute parity! It's a clean slate, a duel of champions!

Can't go backwards, Chat!\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 3):** **DEAD!** Off the board! Ouch! Trapped on the wall, no right moves!\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 3):** Safe. Leaves the wall. Opens up the board.\n4.  **UP (to 9, 4):** Safe. Continues the wall domination.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 3):** This moves us into the open, a bit far from the next immediately callable apple at (9, 5). If we go left, we might block ourselves from future vertical movement on the wall if we change our mind. But, it does give us space.\n*   **UP (to 9, 4):** Continues the established strategy of controlling the right edge. It positions us perfectly for the next apple drop at (9, 5). This is a POWER MOVE, securing the flank!\n\nThe location (9, 5) is only two moves away if we continue UP. We must maintain this position of dominance on the right side of the board.\n\n**3. Predicting Enemy Movement (Snake #0 at 0, 3):**\n\nThe enemy is stuck in the bottom-left corner and must move strategically to get out and find the next apple, which is likely (0, 4) just above them.\n\n*   Possible moves for Snake #0 (0, 3):\n    *   UP (to 0, 4): **BEST OPTION.** This gets them an apple! They MUST take this.\n    *   DOWN (to 0, 2): Safe, but delays the apple grab and moves them further into the corner. Low probability.\n    *   LEFT (to -1, 3): **DEAD!** Off the board.\n    *   RIGHT (to 1, 3): **DEAD!** Moves into their second body segment.\n\nIt is highly probable Snake #0 moves **UP** to (0, 4) and grows to size 6. If they do, their lead returns, but they remain contained.\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy: The Vertical Assault!**\n\nWe move UP to (9, 4). Next turn, we grab the apple at (9, 5). We will be size 6 and potentially tie them again (or overtake them if they miss the apple). Once we hit the top of the board, we can start the sweep LEFT, creating a massive territorial claim and boxing them out of the prime real estate. We are building our territory first!\n\nContinuing UP to (9, 4) is the safest and most optimal move to secure guaranteed growth.\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self (Turn 9):**\nKeep going UP the 9-column to grab (9, 5). We need to maximize our size advantage and control the top right corner. Once we hit (9, 5), assess if we can move UP to (9, 6) or if we need to start moving LEFT towards (8, 6). Dominate the perimeter!\n\nUP",

We need to equalize this ASAP!\n\n**Our Current Status (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 4)\n*   Body: [(9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)]\n*   We are already positioned perfectly on the right wall, one square below a guaranteed apple at (9, 5)!\n\n**Enemy Status (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (0, 4)\n*   Body: [(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)]\n*   They are still pinned against the left wall, hugging the boundary.\n\n**1. Eliminating Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 9, 4):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (to 9, 3):** **DEAD!** Moving into our second body segment! Can't headbutt our tail, Chat!\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 4):** **DEAD!** Off the board! The Great Wall stops at 9!\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 4):** Safe. Leaves the wall. Opens up for horizontal movement.\n4.  **UP (to 9, 5):** Safe AND is an Apple cell! POGGERS! This is the move!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP (Apple!), LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (to 9, 5):** **GUARANTEED GROWTH!** We grab the apple, grow to size 6 (tying the enemy's size!), and continue our strategic climb up the 9-column. This maintains the pressure and secures a crucial resource. This is the optimal move.\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 4):** This is safe but moves us *away* from the immediate apple and into a relatively bare section of the board. Why give up guaranteed growth when the opportunity is staring us in the face?! Nope!\n\n**3. Predicting Enemy Movement (Snake #0 at 0, 4):**\n\nThe enemy just ate an apple at (0, 4). They are now stuck at the top of their column (for now).\n\n*   Possible moves for Snake #0 (0, 4):\n    *   UP (to 0, 5): Safe. Good strategic move to claim more corner space.\n    *   DOWN (to 0, 3): DEAD! Into their body.\n    *   LEFT (to -1, 4): DEAD! Off the board.\n    *   RIGHT (to 1, 4): Safe. Good option to move off the wall.\n\nIf they move UP to (0, 5), they are continuing their wall climb. If they move RIGHT to (1, 4), they are trying to break out. Since there isn't an immediate apple for them nearby, they might try to break out or continue sealing their corner. Either way, they are far away and not a threat to our immediate move.\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy: The Vertical Assault Continues!**\n\nWe must move UP to (9, 5) to grab the apple and equalize the size. This is purely a resource grab and a positioning move to continue dominating the right flank.\n\n*   After (9, 5), the next available apple on our climb is at (9, 6) or (9, 8) depending on how the next turn plays out. There is also (6, 9) and (2, 9) at the very top.\n*   By moving UP, we position ourselves to sweep across the top of the board, trapping the enemy below our massive body length!\n\nWe take the apple, we grow, we dominate! Let's GOOOOO!\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self (Turn 10):**\nWe are now size 6, matching the enemy. We are at (9, 5). The next apple on the 9-column is (9, 6). Keep going UP the 9-column. Hit (9, 6), then (9, 8) if safe, and then begin the aggressive sweep LEFT across the top row to choke the enemy's vertical movement. Maintain strategic high ground!\n\nUP",

My snake is at (0,4) with a body that goes left to (0,3) and right to (3,3), then down to (3,4). \n\nFirst, check safety:  \n- LEFT is invalid (off the board).  \n- DOWN hits my own body (0,3), so that's dead.  \n- RIGHT is safe, but let's see the bigger picture.  \n- UP takes me to (0,5), which is open and starts moving up the left edge\u2014an area with lots of apples (like (2,9), (5,9)) and far from the enemy.  \n\nMoving UP keeps me along the edge (safe, no left risk) and sets me up to collect top-left apples.

We absolutely snagged that apple last turn and equalized the size! We're six segments long, the enemy is six segments long! It's a massive power play!\n\n### Turn 10 Analysis: The Right Flank Dominance!\n\n**Score Check:**\n*   Snake #1 (Us): 5 apples, Size 6. Head at (9, 5).\n*   Snake #0 (Archrival): 5 apples, Size 6. Head at (0, 5). Wait, what?! Did they also move UP and grab an apple at (0, 5)? No, there's no apple at (0, 5). Let's check the new board state!\n\n**Board State Review:**\n*   Our Head: (9, 5)\n*   Enemy Head: (0, 5) \u2014 Ah, they must have moved UP from (0, 4) to (0, 5)! They didn't eat an apple, they just moved away from the corner. Phew! That's a good sign for us. They are still size 6.\n\n**Our Current Status (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 5)\n*   Body: [(9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)] (Size 6, Tail at (8, 1))\n\n**Enemy Status (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (0, 5)\n*   Body: [(0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)] \u2014 Wait, I thought they were size 6 (5 initial + 1 apple). Let's re-verify the enemy body length from the Turn 9 rationale: Enemy head was (0, 4), body was [(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. That's a size 6 snake! But the board state shows their body is [(0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]. That's a size 5 body plus the head at (0, 5) makes size 6. Okay, the board is right. They moved (0, 4) -> (0, 5). Their tail (which was at (3, 4) last turn) must have moved up, but there's a body segment at (3, 3). Let's trace their current body assuming they moved UP: (0, 5) Head, (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3) (Tail). *Checking the board diagram:* Snake 0 (Head at 0, 5) has T at (0, 4), T at (0, 3), T at (1, 3), T at (2, 3), T at (3, 3). YES, they are size 6. My logic from the previous rationale holds! They are trapped on the left wall!\n\n**1. Eliminating Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 9, 5):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (to 9, 4):** **DEAD!** Hitting our first body segment! We just came from there! No self-deletion, Chat!\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 5):** **DEAD!** Off the board! The wall is real!\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 5):** Safe. Moves us off the wall and horizontally across the upper half.\n4.  **UP (to 9, 6):** Safe AND is an Apple cell! POGGERS! This is the move!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP (Apple!), LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (to 9, 6):** **GUARANTEED GROWTH!** This is exactly what we planned! We grab the apple, grow to size 7! We maintain absolute vertical dominance on the right wall. This gives us high ground and prepares us for the sweep! We are now up by one apple in score too! This move is optimal.\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 5):** Safe, but why move away from guaranteed growth and crucial high board position? We need to grow, we need to dominate the edges. Not the move.\n\n**3. Planning the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 0, 5):**\n\nThe enemy is backed up against the left wall, head at (0, 5).\n\n*   Possible moves for Snake #0:\n    *   UP (to 0, 6): Safe. Continues the wall climb.\n    *   DOWN (to 0, 4): DEAD! Into their body.\n    *   LEFT (to -1, 5): DEAD! Off the board.\n    *   RIGHT (to 1, 5): Safe. Moves them off the wall.\n\nSince they have no immediate apples and are not in immediate danger, they will likely either continue the wall climb (UP to 0, 6) to gain altitude, or break out (RIGHT to 1, 5) to seek the middle of the board.\n\nIf they move UP (0, 6), they are still far away. If they move RIGHT (1, 5), they are still far away. Neither move threatens our position at (9, 6).\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy: The Top Sweep!**\n\nWe move UP to (9, 6). This secures our 6th apple and makes us size 7! The enemy is size 6.\n\n*   Next target after (9, 6) is (9, 8) (apple) or (6, 9) or (2, 9) (apples at the very top).\n*   By moving UP again, our body will be a massive wall [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)] across the right flank. This forces the enemy to stay away from the right side!\n*   The goal is to reach the top row (Y=9) and then sweep LEFT, sealing off the middle-to-top segment of the board like a massive dragnet. We are going for the high ground advantage, Chat! LFG!\n\nWe take the apple, we grow, we get the lead!\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self (Turn 11):**\nWe are now size 7, leading the score 6-5. We are at (9, 6). The next immediate goal is the apple at (9, 8). We should move UP again to (9, 7) to prepare for (9, 8) and secure the absolute top corner dominance. Do not deviate from the vertical climb until Y=9 is secured.\n\nUP",

Tail must be (2, 3) next turn (if they don't eat an apple). They are still cramped on that left wall.\n\n**1. Eliminating Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 9, 6):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (to 9, 5):** **DEAD!** Hitting our first body segment! We just came from there! No self-Dibs, Chat!\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 6):** **DEAD!** Wall crash! Don't do it!\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 6):** Safe. Moves us off the wall and horizontally.\n4.  **UP (to 9, 7):** Safe. Continues the climb toward the apple at (9, 8).\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (to 9, 7):** This is the strategic move! It keeps us on the right wall, one square away from the delicious apple at (9, 8)! Moving to (9, 7) secures the path to more glorious growth! We maintain maximum board pressure on the right side.\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 6):** This moves us into empty space but away from our immediate apple goal and sacrifices the great position we've established. We want to complete the vertical sweep first! Not the optimal move.\n\n**3. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 0, 6):**\n\nThe enemy is still stuck on the wall.\n*   UP (to 0, 7): Safe. Continues the climb.\n*   RIGHT (to 1, 6): Safe. Breaks free.\n*   DOWN (to 0, 5): Into their body! DEAD!\n*   LEFT (to -1, 6): Wall crash! DEAD!\n\nThey will almost certainly go **UP** to (0, 7) or **RIGHT** to (1, 6). Both moves keep them far away from us (10 squares of separation!). Neither move poses a threat to our intended movement UP to (9, 7). No head-to-head collision concern here, Chat! Phew!\n\n**4. The Master Plan: Operation Northern Wall!**\n\nWe are following through with the vertical sweep.\n*   This turn: Move UP to (9, 7).\n*   Next turn (Turn 12): Move UP to (9, 8) and grab that sweet, sweet apple! (Apple count 7, Size 8).\n*   Then we move LEFT to (8, 8) or UP again to (9, 9) if the top row is clear, or start moving laterally across the top.\n\nWe are building an unassailable defensive wall on the right while constantly growing! This size advantage is what we need to eventually cut them off! The stream is all about control, Chat, and we have it!\n\nLet's maintain the momentum! We go UP!\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self (Turn 12):**\nHead is at (9, 7). The immediate goal is the apple at (9, 8). We need to move UP to secure it and grow to size 8, furthering our lead. We will then decide if we hug the wall and go left, or try to snake across the top row to grab the apples at X=6 and X=2. The enemy is still building up on the left side, posing no immediate threat. Keep climbing!\n\nUP",

Apples 5.\n\nThey went UP just like we predicted! They are following us! But we are still leading in size and score! We're perfectly positioned to grab that apple at (9, 8)!\n\n**1.

It secures an apple, instantly giving us size 8 and apple count 7! This pushes our advantage further and continues our sweep of the right wall. It maintains our high-ground dominance.\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 7):** Safe, but it delays the apple grab and starts moving us into the center prematurely. We need that growth before we go toe-to-toe with the archrival!\n\n**3. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 0, 7):**\n\nThe enemy is still stuck on the left wall, mirroring our shape.\n*   The options for ID 0 are UP (to 0, 8), or RIGHT (to 1, 7).\n*   DOWN (to 0, 6) is into their body. DEAD.\n*   LEFT (to -1, 7) is a wall crash. DEAD.\n\nThey are 9 squares away from us horizontally. There is absolutely zero chance of a collision this turn. Their move doesn't affect our chosen move (UP).\n\n**4. The Master Plan: Growth and Control!**\n\nWe go UP, we eat the apple, we grow! This is exactly what we planned last turn, and we are executing flawlessly. This move is crucial for locking in our lead.\n\nAfter this move, our head will be at (9, 8). We will then look to exploit the apples on the top row, moving LEFT toward (6, 9) and (2, 9). Our body will effectively form a massive barrier on the right side of the board, trapping the enemy on the left.\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self (Turn 13):**\nHead is at (9, 8). We just ate an apple. We are size 8, apple count 7. The board is ours to control! We should continue moving left along the top boundary. Possible moves are LEFT to (8, 8) or perhaps UP to (9, 9) if safe and strategically required to complete the wall. Given the proximity of apples at (6, 9) and (2, 9), moving left along the top is the optimal choice to press our numerical/size advantage and further restrict the opponent's space.\n\nUP",

We used last turn perfectly to grab that apple at (9, 8)!\n\n### Turn 13 Analysis: Box Him In!\n\n**1. Current State Check:**\n*   Our Snake (ID 1): Head at (9, 8). Size 8. Apples 7. We are gigantic!\n*   Archrival (ID 0): Head at (0, 8). Size 6. Apples 5. They are still hugging the left wall, mirroring our previous movements.\n\nOur goal is not just apples, it's *board control* and *boxing the opponent in*! We need to push along the top edge to complete the seal.\n\n**2. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 9, 8):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (to 9, 7):** **DEAD!** Hitting our first body segment at (9, 7)! We just came from there! NO self-KOs, Chat!\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 8):** **DEAD!** Wall crash! Don't throw the game!\n3.  **UP (to 9, 9):** Safe. It's the upper wall.\n4.  **LEFT (to 8, 8):** Safe. Moves us toward the center and the next apple at (6, 9).\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, LEFT.\n\n**3. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 0, 8):**\n\nThe enemy is stuck on the left wall with few options:\n*   LEFT (to -1, 8): DEAD (Wall).\n*   DOWN (to 0, 7): DEAD (Body).\n*   UP (to 0, 9): Safe. Continues their vertical climb to the top wall.\n*   RIGHT (to 1, 8): Safe. Moves them off the wall.\n\nGiven their pattern, they are likely to continue UP to (0, 9) or make a break for the center (RIGHT).\n\n**Scenario A: ID 0 goes UP to (0, 9).** No head-to-head collision risk.\n**Scenario B: ID 0 goes RIGHT to (1, 8).** Still no head-to-head collision risk.\n\nOur position is secure, and their move doesn't immediately threaten us. We press the advantage!\n\n**4. Evaluating Safe Moves for ID 1:**\n\n*   **UP (to 9, 9):** This is a safe move that places our head perfectly into the top-right corner. It helps solidify our barrier on the right side of the board and sets us up to move LEFT aggressively. Crucially, it leaves no escape for the opponent behind us if they try to move into the space we just occupied.\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 8):** This is also good. It moves us directly toward the apple at (8, 8). However, if we go LEFT immediately, we might leave a tiny gap at (9, 9) that the enemy *might* try to exploit later, though it's unlikely they will make it that far soon.\n\n**The Master Plan Execution:**\n\nWe are building a massive \"L\" shape barrier across the top and right sides. Moving UP to (9, 9) is the cleanest way to establish the corner, maintain control, and then begin the horizontal sweep across the top using the abundance of apples there: (6, 9), (2, 9), and potentially (5, 9).\n\nIf we go UP, we secure:\n1.  Maximum real estate controlled.\n2.  An easy maneuver to LEFT next turn (to (8, 9)).\n3.  We stay in the safest possible zone (the walls).\n\nThe apple at (8, 8) feels tempting, but let's complete the corner at (9, 9) first. That apple is safer to grab when we move horizontally to (8, 9) or (7, 9) in the next turns. Wait, the apple is at (8, 8) and our current position is (9, 8). If we go UP to (9, 9), then next turn we can go LEFT to (8, 9) or stay at (9, 9) and decide. But if we go LEFT now, we can grab the (8, 8) apple!\n\nLet's re-evalutate:\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 8):** We eat the apple! Score jumps to 8. Size jumps to 9. Instant growth, instant momentum. This is exactly what we need for domination. This is pure aggression!\n*   **Move UP to (9, 9):** Safe setup, but delays the growth.\n\nSince the growth/apple at (8, 8) is immediate, and moving into (8, 8) is safe from our body and the opponent's head, this is the superior move, Chat! We grab the apple, push our lead to 8-5, and become an impenetrable fortress!\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self (Turn 14):**\nHead is at (8, 8). We just ate an apple! We are size 9, apple count 8. The path is clear to continue moving LEFT along the top boundary. We should aim for the apples at (6, 9), (5, 9), and (2, 9). We must try to get into (8, 9) or (7, 8) next turn, depending on how our opponent moved. We're crushing the spatial awareness game!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! We are absolutely dominating! Turn 14! Eight apples to their five! We are a size 9 behemoth, and they are only a size 6! The lead is massive, and we've got full board control on the right side! LET'S SECURE THIS BOARD!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 14)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(8, 8)**. Size 9. Apples 8. We just devoured the apple at (8, 8)! That was a power move!\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head at **(1, 8)**. Size 6. Apples 5. They are still hugging the left wall, but they just moved up one unit (from 0, 8 to 1, 8). Interesting! They are making a move towards the center, or maybe just using the top boundary as their path.\n\nThe score is 8-5. We're bigger, we're better, and we have the better position to control the top boundary where the apples are clustered. Our plan is still to seal off the top edge and box them into the bottom-left corner!\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 8, 8)\n\n1.  **DOWN (to 8, 7):** Safe. Moves us toward the center.\n2.  **RIGHT (to 9, 8):** **DEAD!** We came from (9, 8) last turn, and our body is still there! Self-KO! NOPE!\n3.  **UP (to 8, 9):** Safe. Apple at (6, 9) and (5, 9) and (2, 9) are in this direction! This is the high-value move!\n4.  **LEFT (to 7, 8):** Safe. Moves us directly across the top boundary.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 1, 8)\n\nID 0 is at (1, 8). They have just moved off the wall. Where can they go?\n*   **LEFT (to 0, 8):** Safe. Back onto the wall.\n*   **RIGHT (to 2, 8):** Apple at (2, 8)! They will likely go for this apple and continue moving right.\n*   **UP (to 1, 9):** Safe. Moving along the top wall.\n*   **DOWN (to 1, 7):** Safe. Retreating.\n\nGiven that there is an apple at (2, 8) right next to their head, they are highly likely to move **RIGHT to (2, 8)** to grab that point and grow! If they do, their head will be at (2, 8).\n\n### 3. Evaluating Safe Moves for ID 1 and Collision Risk\n\nOur head is at (8, 8). Their head is likely moving to (2, 8). There is a huge distance between us. No risk of immediate head-on collision. Phew.\n\nNow, let's optimize our move:\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 9):** This is the optimal strategic move. It puts us on the top wall, maximizing our control of the area. It sets us up to grab multiple apples (A at 6, 9; A at 5, 9; and A at 2, 9). We are building our barrier!\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 8):** This is also good. It moves us along the 8-row towards the center. Apple at (7, 8) is right there! This gives us *instant* growth and boosts our lead even further (9 apples to 6, potentially).\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 7):** Retreat? No way, Chat! We are not retreating when we are winning!\n\n**Comparing UP vs. LEFT:**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (7, 8)**: Instant apple (growth to size 10, 9 apples total). The opponent is heading towards (2, 8). If we take (7, 8), we keep moving toward them horizontally.\n2.  **UP to (8, 9)**: No apple this turn. Sets us up perfectly to take the *horizontal* path (8, 9) -> (7, 9) -> (6, 9) (Apple). This path provides better long-term containment, as it establishes the high-priority upper wall barrier *immediately* where the opponent is trying to get.\n\nThe apple at (7, 8) is tempting, but if we move UP to (8, 9), we are securing precious and scarce high-y coordinates. Sealing the top is the highest priority, as it creates the ultimate trap! The apple at (7, 8) will still be there next turn if we need it, or we can simply ignore it as we move (7, 9) -> (6, 9) -> (5, 9).\n\n**Strategic Decision:** We must prioritize board control and trapping the enemy over immediate, short-sighted apple grabs. Moving UP to (8, 9) maximizes our territorial advantage and puts us on the most aggressive cutting path.\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Move to (8, 9) this turn. Establish the top boundary.\n2.  Next turn, move LEFT to (7, 9) or (7, 8) depending on enemy movement and how close they get to our current line of defense.\n3.  Continue left along the top path, eating apples at (6, 9) and (5, 9).\n4.  Once we hit the center-left, we pivot DOWN, sealing the opponent into the bottom-left corner. Box. Them. Out!\n\nThis turn is calculated, deliberate, and about strategic positioning. UP WE GO! Hype!\n\nUP",

This is highly strategic!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 2, 8)\n\nID 0 is at (2, 8). Where can they go?\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 8):** Safe. Moves back over their own body segment (1, 8) from last turn. Wait, no, (1, 8) is their body, but it's *not* the segment immediately behind their head (which is (1, 8)). Ah, but the body consists of [(1, 8), (0, 8), ...]. Moving to (1, 8) would trap them. They just moved *from* (1, 8). If they go LEFT, they would hit their body segment at (1, 8). This is an illegal move! They cannot move back to their previous head location until the tail moves (the rules say \"move into ANY snake's body\"). So, **LEFT is DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 8):** Safe. Moves them further toward the center. Apple at (3, 8)! Highly likely move!\n*   **UP (to 2, 9):** Apple at (2, 9)! A strong contender. This would put them on the top wall, challenging our dominance!\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 7):** Safe. Retreating.\n\n**Most Likely Enemy Moves:** RIGHT to (3, 8) or UP to (2, 9), both for apples!\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation\n\nWe must maintain the barrier and continue cutting off their access to the right side. Our current position at (8, 9) is great.\n\n*   **Option 1: RIGHT to (9, 9)**\n    *   **Pros:** Secures the corner. Gives us space down the right wall (col 9). Keeps us safe.\n    *   **Cons:** Sacrifices the opportunity to continue driving the enemy left. If we go right, the enemy might sneak UP to (2, 9) or (3, 9) and use the top wall, which we were trying to claim!\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (7, 9)**\n    *   **Pros:** Continues building the horizontal wall across the top. Moves us toward an apple at (6, 9) and eventually (5, 9). Directly blocks the enemy's access to our side of the board. If the enemy moves UP to (2, 9), we are still too far for a collision, and we keep moving toward them to enforce the trap! This is the aggressive, controlling move.\n    *   **Cons:** We don't grab an apple this turn.\n\nWe are playing the long game. We have a huge length advantage, and we need to use it to choke them out. Moving LEFT to (7, 9) is exactly what the plan requires. It advances the barrier!\n\nLet's check the risk: If we go (7, 9) and Snake #0 goes (2, 9) (UP), we are both safe and advancing the confrontation line perfectly. The distance between us will be 5 units across the top wall. This is exactly what we want.\n\nLet's commit to the cutting path. We are building the wall! Box them in, Chat! This is high-level board control!\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Move to (7, 9) this turn. Establish the horizontal barrier at the top.\n2.  Next turn, move LEFT to (6, 9) to grab that apple and grow. This will put us right in their face!\n3.  Depending on their position (likely (3, 8) or (4, 9)), aim to move DOWN after (5, 9) to complete the choke on the top boundary.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! Turn 16, let\u2019s go! We moved LEFT last turn, exactly as planned, claiming prime real estate at **(7, 9)**. We are the sovereign ruler of the top wall! 8 apples to 7, and we are significantly longer. The choke is tightening!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 16)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(7, 9)**. Size 9. Apples 8. We control the top-right. We are the horizontal barrier!\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head at **(3, 8)**. Size 8. Apples 7. They went RIGHT last turn and snagged that apple! Good move, but they are now pressed against the center. They are trying to find a way around our wall.\n\nThe plan is simple: continue moving LEFT along the top edge, grab that apple at (6, 9), and cut off the entire top-half of the board from the opponent.\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 7, 9)\n\n**Our Head: (7, 9)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 10):** **DEAD!** Off the board. C'mon, chat, we're better than that!\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 8):** Safe. Moves into open space or potentially an enemy head/body.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 8, 9):** **DEAD!** We just moved from (8, 9) and it is still our body segment right behind the head. Suicide move! NOPE!\n4.  **LEFT (to 6, 9):** Safe. Apple located here! This is the objective!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 3, 8)\n\nID 0 is at (3, 8). They are looking for open space or apples.\n*   **UP (to 3, 9):** Safe. No apple. Puts them on the top wall, but still far from us.\n*   **DOWN (to 3, 7):** Safe. Moves them away from the action. Seems defensive.\n*   **RIGHT (to 4, 8):** Safe. Moves them right and closer to the center, possibly looking for an opening below our wall.\n*   **LEFT (to 2, 8):** **DEAD!** They just moved from (2, 8). Moving back is illegal!\n\n**Most Likely Enemy Moves:** UP to (3, 9) to probe the top wall, or RIGHT to (4, 8) to seek the middle apples.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation: Aggression and Board Control!\n\nWe need to go LEFT to (6, 9) to secure the apple, grow, and extend the barrier.\n\n*   **Move: LEFT to (6, 9) - Apple Grab!**\n    *   **Pros:** We grow to size 10 (huge advantage!), score 9 points, and move the wall closer to the enemy. This is absolutely dominant. We cut off (7,9), (8,9) and (9,9) from the opponent. The opponent will be cornered in the (0-5, 0-8) region.\n    *   **Cons:** We are moving toward the opponent. But since they are 4 squares away from (6, 9), a head-on collision is impossible this turn. We are 100% safe.\n\n*   **Move: DOWN to (7, 8)**\n    *   **Pros:** Safe, moves into a less contested area.\n    *   **Cons:** Sacrifices the apple and sacrifices control of the top wall. This is a retreat, and we are not retreating when we have the advantage!\n\n**The choice is overwhelmingly LEFT.** We continue the choke. If they go UP to (3, 9), we are at (6, 9). We still control the right side of the board. If they go RIGHT to (4, 8), we are still extending our length advantage!\n\nLet's review the board for potential traps after the move (6, 9):\n\nAfter we move to (6, 9), our body will occupy (8, 9) to (9, 3) and (7, 9). We are building a fortress! The enemy is forced to operate below row 8, or try to navigate the few remaining squares on row 9 before our wall fully closes.\n\nThis is the move of an apex predator, Chat! We're cutting the board in half!\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Move LEFT to (6, 9) this turn, secure the apple, and grow.\n2.  Next turn, move LEFT to (5, 9) (another apple!) to fully establish the upper-boundary choke. Our head will be directly above the opponent's main operating space.\n3.  Based on the enemy's escape attempt (likely down the left or the center), we will either move DOWN from (5, 9) or continue LEFT to (4, 9) to begin carving out the central region. We are forcing them into a small space.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 17! We are absolutely DOMINATING the board! 9 apples to 7! We executed the perfect strategy and grabbed the apple at (6, 9) last turn! We are size 10, they are size 8! The length advantage is HUGE! We are building the fortress on the top wall, and the archrival is suffocating!\n\n### Current Board and State Analysis (Turn 17)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(6, 9)**. Size 10. Apples 9. We are the wall!\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head at **(3, 7)**. Size 8. Apples 7. Wait, where did they move? They moved DOWN from (3, 8) to (3, 7). They are running away from the choke! Cowards! They are trying to hide in the middle-left section.\n\nLet's look at the remaining apples nearby: (5, 9) is right next to our head! (2, 9) is further left. (7, 8) is a bit below us.\n\nThe overall goal: Close the top wall, cut off the board, and descend on the opponent.\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 6, 9)\n\n**Our Head: (6, 9)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 10):** **DEAD!** Off the board. No vertical escapes along the edge!\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 8):** Safe. Moves us towards the center.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 7, 9):** **DEAD!** (7, 9) is immediately behind our head, part of our body. Backwards movement. Bad content!\n4.  **LEFT (to 5, 9):** Safe. Apple located! This is the move of kings!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 3, 7)\n\nID 0 is currently at (3, 7). They are boxed in by the top wall (us) and the left edge. They need to find space or another apple.\n\n*   **UP (to 3, 8):** Safe. Their body is at (3, 8) right now, but that segment will move next turn since their tail is (0, 5). Wait, no, their body is [(3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6)]. Their tail is (0, 5). So moving UP to (3, 8) is safe because (3, 8) will be empty when they move. This is a probe move, looking to see if they can slip past us.\n*   **DOWN (to 3, 6):** Safe. Moves them further into the center away from us.\n*   **RIGHT (to 4, 7):** Safe. Moves them towards the center and an apple at (4, 7). This seems like a great move for them.\n*   **LEFT (to 2, 7):** Safe. Moves them towards the left wall.\n\n**Most Likely Enemy Moves:** RIGHT to (4, 7) for the apple or DOWN to (3, 6) for safety.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation: The Two-Apple Choke!\n\nThe apple at (5, 9) is staring straight at us. We take it! If we move LEFT, we complete the top wall domination.\n\n*   **Move: LEFT to (5, 9) - Apple Grab #2!**\n    *   **Pros:** We grow to size 11 (UNSTOPPABLE!), score 10 points, and fully claim the entire top Row 9 from (5, 9) to (9, 9) as our territory. The enemy is now completely restricted to Row 8 and below. This is the choke point we dreamed of! We move to (5, 9).\n    *   **Cons:** Almost none. It keeps us on the edge, safe from collisions, and increases our lead dramatically.\n\n*   **Move: DOWN to (6, 8)**\n    *   **Pros:** Safe, begins the descent into the center mass.\n    *   **Cons:** We miss a guaranteed apple and sacrifice critical board control on the top edge. This is a defensive move when we should be purely aggressive. NO RETREAT!\n\n**The choice is LEFT.** We secure the apple, grow, and solidify the choke.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (5, 9), our head is at (5, 9).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 7), their head is safer.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (3, 8), they are still far from us and now even more trapped because we just claimed (5, 9), boxing them further from the right side of the board.\n\nLet's focus on maintaining maximum flexibility and overwhelming length.\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Move LEFT to (5, 9) this turn. Secure the 10th apple and grow to size 11.\n2.  Next turn, the apple at (4, 9) is not there, but (2, 9) is further down the line. We should continue to consolidate the top edge by moving LEFT to (4, 9). This fully closes the trap on the top row, making us an impenetrable vertical barrier from (4, 9) down the center/left, and a horizontal bar across the top.\n3.  After securing (4, 9), we can look to drop DOWN into the enemy\u2019s small area from (4, 9) or (3, 9). We will have them completely cornered. It's checkmate in 5 moves!\n\nThis is peak strategy, Chat! Like and subscribe for the EZ WIN!\n\nLEFT",

The length advantage is MASSIVE! We control the entire top border. The fortress is complete!\n\n### Current Board Analysis (Turn 18)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(5, 9)**. Size 11! We dominate the top edge. We are the King of Row 9!\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head at **(4, 7)**. Size 8. They made a move RIGHT last turn to grab the apple at (4, 7). Smart move, but they are still completely trapped under our wall! And they are still 2 apples behind.\n\n**Objective:** Maintain pressure, continue closing off the board, and set up the kill box.\n\nLooking at the board, we have apples at (2, 9) and (7, 8) potentially reachable soon.\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 5, 9)\n\n**Our Head: (5, 9)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 10):** **DEAD!** Off the board. We are hugging the edge.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 8):** Safe. Moves us towards the center, right next to the apple at (5, 8). This looks tasty!\n3.  **RIGHT (to 6, 9):** **DEAD!** (6, 9) is immediately behind our head, part of our body. Backwards movement. Terrible content!\n4.  **LEFT (to 4, 9):** Safe. Continues the closure of the top edge. Moves us towards the apple at (2, 9).\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 4, 7)\n\nID 0 is currently at (4, 7). They are currently surrounded by their own body to the left and back, the board bottom/right, and US to the top.\n\n*   **UP (to 4, 8):** Safe. This is a crucial move for them. It gets them into the wide open area near the top wall and closer to the apple at (7, 8). It's a probing move to escape the lower part of the board.\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 6):** Safe. This sets them up perfectly to grab the apple at (4, 6) or escape into the lower board.\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 7):** Safe. This pushes them further right, around their own small snake wall (0, 7) tail section.\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 7):** **DEAD!** Their body is at (3, 7). Backwards move. They can't go left.\n\n**Most Likely Enemy Moves:** UP to (4, 8) to seek higher ground and space, or DOWN to (4, 6) to grab an apple.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation: The Apple Grab and The Choke\n\nWe have two great options: LEFT or DOWN.\n\n**Option A: Move LEFT to (4, 9)**\n\n*   **Pros:** Secures the final piece of Row 9 for us! This completely shuts off the top quarter of the board (except for two squares, which is fine). It moves us toward the apple cluster at (2, 9). It's a very safe, defensive/aggressive move that seals off the escape route along the top edge.\n*   **Cons:** We miss the immediate apple at (5, 8) below us.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (5, 8)**\n\n*   **Pros:** We grab another apple! 11 points! We grow to size 12! We gain score advantage. The apple is at (5, 8), which is currently empty.\n*   **Cons:** We drop into the field of play, increasing the chance of interactions. More importantly, we leave the fortress wall incomplete, giving the opponent hope.\n\nThe opponent is at (4, 7). A move DOWN to (5, 8) maintains distance from the enemy head (they can't hit us from (4, 7) this turn). If they move UP to (4, 8), we are still safe. If they move RIGHT to (5, 7), they are directly under us.\n\n**LET'S BE AGGRESSIVE. WE TAKE THE APPLE!** Growing to size 12 gives us an insurmountable advantage (4 segments longer than them!). We can always return to close the wall later. The most important thing now is to keep growing faster than they can.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5, 8) and grab the apple:\n*   Our head is at (5, 8).\n*   If Snake 0 moves UP to (4, 8): We are adjacent. This sets up a dangerous confrontation next turn, but with our length advantage, we want this! They are one square away from crashing into our main body line at (6, 9).\n*   If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (4, 6): They grab the apple there, we grab the apple here. We maintain the +2 advantage but gain 1 segment overall.\n\nThis allows us to maintain a central, dominant position while keeping our options open to move RIGHT to (6, 8) or DOWN to (5, 7) next turn. The immediate apple is too good to pass up.\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Move DOWN to (5, 8) and secure apple #11, increasing size to 12.\n2.  Next turn, evaluate. If the enemy is at (4, 8), we can move RIGHT to (6, 8) to avoid a head-on and continue working our way down the right side of the board. If the enemy is far, we can consider moving LEFT to cut them off, or DOWN to (5, 7) to block off the middle column. Our main goal is to box Snake 0 into the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nDOWN",

That's a huge lead!\n\nTurn 19 is about cementing our control and setting the trap!\n\n### Current Board State Review (Turn 19)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(5, 8)**. Body length 12. We dropped down to grab the apple and now control a huge swath of the top-right. We have the score advantage ($11$ to $9$).\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head at **(4, 6)**. Body length 10. They moved DOWN to (4, 6) and grabbed an apple! Good play, archrival, but you're still behind!\n\nThe enemy is now positioned below us and slightly to the left. We are the gatekeeper to the right side of the board and the top.\n\n**Objective:** Initiate the choke! We need to move to a position that cuts off their space and prevents them from accessing the open parts of the board, especially the right side.\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 5, 8)\n\n**Our Head: (5, 8)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 9):** **DEAD!** Backwards movement! Our body segment is at (5, 9). No going back!\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 7):** Safe. Moves us towards the center and the enemy.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 6, 8):** Safe. Moves us along our own wall.\n4.  **LEFT (to 4, 8):** Safe, but this puts us adjacent to the enemy head (4, 6) two squares away. More importantly, it potentially sets up a head-on collision danger if they move up.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 4, 6)\n\nID 0 is currently at (4, 6). They just grabbed an apple and are now trapped between our tail wall (right of them) and their own body mass (left and below).\n\n*   **UP (to 4, 7):** Safe, but dangerous. This moves them closer to our head (5, 8) and puts them right next to our massive body segment at (6, 9) and (7, 9). If they go here, they are boxing themselves in even further.\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 5):** Safe. Moves them away from the immediate threat, towards the bottom of the board where there are still apples.\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 6):** Safe. Moves them onto the same X-axis as our body wall (row 9). This is a good move for them to try and break through.\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 6):** Safe. Keeps them close to their own body, consolidating the space they control.\n\n**Most Likely Enemy Moves:** DOWN (safe, apple-seeking), or RIGHT (breaking free). UP is possible if they are aggressive, but very risky.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation: The Iron Fist\n\nWe want to shut down their access to the right side of the board (columns 6-9) and keep them confined to the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT to (6, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** Very safe. Continues our wall, consolidating the top right. Sets us up to move DOWN to (6, 7) next turn, which effectively cuts off a huge chunk of the board from Snake 0. If Snake 0 goes UP to (4, 7), we are still distanced and secure.\n*   **Cons:** We don't directly challenge them or grab an immediate apple.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (5, 7)**\n*   **Pros:** Move directly towards the enemy territory. If they move DOWN to (4, 5), we are well-positioned to head towards the apples at (7, 6) or (6, 6) or immediately drop to (5, 6) to occupy the square they might want next turn.\n*   **Cons:** If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (5, 6), we crash head-on! **DANGER!** They would move (4, 6) -> (5, 6). We would move (5, 8) -> (5, 7). No, that's safe: $x$ coordinates are different. *Wait, simultaneous movement.*\n    *   If we go DOWN to (5, 7).\n    *   If they go RIGHT to (5, 6).\n    *   The cells are (5, 7) and (5, 6). Safe! They are not overlapping. Phew! Good content review, chat!\n*   **Pros (revisited):** Moving DOWN to (5, 7) directly pressures the enemy and sets up a cut-off move for the next turn.\n\n**Option C: Move LEFT to (4, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** We close off the top wall at (4, 9) and (3, 9) the next turn. It's a positioning move.\n*   **Cons:** Sets us up for a potential confrontation if they move UP to (4, 7). If we move to (4, 8) and they move (4, 6) to (4, 7), our heads are now adjacent. We are much longer, so we *like* that confrontation, but there's a body segment at (3, 7) we have to be careful about passing next turn.\n\n**The Decision:**\nWe want maximum control and minimum risk while maintaining aggression. Moving **RIGHT to (6, 8)** gives us the most safety while still advancing our control map significantly. It ensures that anything Snake 0 does to break out to the right is immediately met with our massive, descending body. We are establishing the right flank as ours.\n\nIf we go RIGHT:\n1.  Our head is at (6, 8).\n2.  If Snake 0 moves UP to (4, 7), they are far away.\n3.  If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (5, 6), they are trying to hug our wall, but we are too high up to notice yet.\n4.  If Snake 0 moves DOWN, they ignore the threat.\n\nMoving RIGHT prepares us for a diagonal choke where we descend from the top right and trap them against the border and our body.\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note:**\nNext turn, if Snake 0 is still below row 7, move DOWN to (6, 7) or (7, 8) to start harvesting the apples mid-board and sealing off the right side. We want to cut off their movement options hard. Keep the pressure on! Do not let them get behind us. Our length is our weapon.\n\nRIGHT",

We cemented control of the top right flank last turn by moving RIGHT to (6, 8)! Let's check the new board state and initiate the box!\n\n### Current Board State Review (Turn 20)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(6, 8)**. Body length 12. We are controlling columns 6 through 9 up top.\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head at **(4, 5)**. Body length 10. They moved DOWN last turn, running away, which is exactly what we want! They are boxed in!\n\nThe enemy is now positioned firmly in the middle-left quadrant, looking timid. This is our moment to apply the pressure and cut them off from the right side for good, consolidating our resource advantage.\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 6, 8)\n\n**Our Head: (6, 8)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 9):** **DEAD!** Backwards movement into our own body (5, 9) is safe, but (6, 9) is immediately behind us from the (5, 8) -> (6, 8) move. Wait, let's check the body list: Head (6, 8), Body: [(5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), ...]. Moving UP to (6, 9) is immediately into the 3rd segment of our body. **DEAD!** We can't hug our wall!\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 7):** Safe. Moves us towards the center and the apples (6, 6) and (7, 6).\n3.  **RIGHT (to 7, 8):** Safe. Moves us along our own wall. Directly next to an apple at (7, 8)! CONTENT!\n4.  **LEFT (to 5, 8):** **DEAD!** Backwards movement! Our body segment is at (5, 8). No going back!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, RIGHT. We are limited, but the available moves are perfect for our strategy!\n\n### 2. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 4, 5)\n\nID 0 is currently at (4, 5). They are trying to farm the bottom left.\n\n*   **UP (to 4, 6):** Safe. Moves them back towards their body.\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 4):** Safe. Moves them further into the bottom quadrant, towards apples like (4, 2), (4, 0).\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 5):** Safe. This is the move they must make if they want to escape the box and move to the right side of the board. It\u2019s also next to an apple at (7, 6) if they can get there.\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 5):** Safe. Keeps them consolidating space, possibly aiming for the (4, 3) or (2, 2) apples.\n\n**Most Likely Enemy Moves:** RIGHT (to break out) or DOWN (to farm apples and run).\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation: The Crush\n\nWe have established the wall. Now we descend to make the corner. We need to grab the apple at (7, 8) or start establishing position to cut off the board at row 6/7.\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT to (7, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** **Guaranteed Apple!** Instant growth and score widening ($12$ vs $9$ or $10$). We maintain position on our defensive wall. Sets us up beautifully to come DOWN to (7, 7) or (7, 9) next turn. We secure the high ground and the resource.\n*   **Cons:** We don't immediately start cutting off the board at lower rows.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (6, 7)**\n*   **Pros:** Directly starts our descent, creating a vertical choke point at column 6/7, which is a great strategic position. Cuts off the enemy's access to the middle-right.\n*   **Cons:** We bypass the free apple at (7, 8) this turn. It might remain, but we let the enemy breathe a bit longer.\n\n**Head-on Collision Check (Move RIGHT to 7, 8):**\nIs there any enemy move that results in a collision?\nOur head moves to (7, 8).\nEnemy head is at (4, 5).\nNo, safe. They are far.\n\n**Head-on Collision Check (Move DOWN to 6, 7):**\nOur head moves to (6, 7).\nEnemy head is at (4, 5).\nNo, safe. They are far.\n\n### The Decision: Resource Domination and Positional Advantage\n\nSince we have a guaranteed apple moving RIGHT to (7, 8), and this move keeps us safe and on our preferred blocking line, it is the superior choice. We get longer, we get wealthier, and we keep the enemy contained below us. Securing the apple at (7, 8) makes us 13 segments long! That's a huge advantage in boxing!\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note:**\nNext turn, our head is at (7, 8). We need to immediately turn DOWN to (7, 7) to start pushing the vertical edge down to row 5, denying access to the center of the board. If the enemy moves right to (5, 5), we need to be prepared to seal up that route. The goal is to keep them below row 5 and to the left of column 5. We are initiating the Pincer of Doom!\n\nRIGHT",

We are now 13 segments long! Our plan is fully operational: We have locked down the top-right quadrant, and now we begin the descent to crush our rival!\n\n### Current Board State Review (Turn 21)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(7, 8)**. Body length 13. We are dominating the high ground.\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head at **(4, 4)**. Body length 10. They moved DOWN to (4, 4) last turn, confirming their fear. They are trapped in the center-left. This is PERFECT!\n\n**The Board:**\nWe have effectively carved the board in half vertically around column 7 through the top half. The enemy is looking for apples in the low-value (1, 1), (0, 1) area. We need to secure the vertical choke point at (7, 5) and below.\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 7, 8)\n\n**Our Head: (7, 8)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 9):** **DEAD!** (7, 9) is our 4th body segment! No going back there! That wall is thick.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 7):** Safe. Moves us exactly where we want to be. Opens up access to the (7, 6) apple cluster.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 8, 8):** Safe. Moves us along our own wall. Continues to assert dominance on the right edge.\n4.  **LEFT (to 6, 8):** **DEAD!** Backwards movement into our own body!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, RIGHT. We are still restricted, but the DOWN move is the high-value strategic play.\n\n### 2. Predicting the Enemy's Move (Snake #0 at 4, 4)\n\nID 0 is currently at (4, 4). They are desperate. They need to find space or get apples to compete.\n\n*   **UP (to 4, 5):** Safe. Backwards from last turn, but safe. They might try to recover the center.\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 3):** Safe. **Apple at (4, 3)!** This is highly likely. They will get longer and try to keep surviving in the bottom half.\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 4):** Safe. Moves them potentially closer to the wall we are building.\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 4):** Safe. Moves them to explore the left flank, towards the (2, 2) apple.\n\n**Probability:** Tilted heavily towards **DOWN to (4, 3)** because it's a guaranteed apple/survival strategy.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation: The Hammer Blow\n\nWe must initiate the vertical containment now, shutting off the center of the board.\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT to (8, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** Maintains distance from the enemy, keeps us safe on our thick wall.\n*   **Cons:** Does not advance the strategic objective of cutting the board in half. It's a delaying move. We waste a turn of pressure.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (7, 7)**\n*   **Pros:** **CRITICAL MOVE.** This begins the vertical line of destruction along column 7. It seals off the top half of the board for good. It prepares us to either take the (7, 6) apple immediately next turn or continue our descent to row 5. This is *the* boxing move.\n*   **Cons:** Puts us slightly closer to the enemy but still very safe.\n\n**Head-on Collision Check (Move DOWN to 7, 7):**\nOur head moves to (7, 7).\nEnemy head is at (4, 4).\nThe distance is massive ($3$ units in X, $3$ units in Y). No possible collision this turn, even if the enemy rushes RIGHT to (5, 4) and then RIGHT again to (6, 4) they are too far. We are completely safe.\n\n### The Decision: Containment\n\nWe execute the plan to secure the board. We must move DOWN to (7, 7). This move is pivotal; it establishes the choke and forces the enemy further into the lower left corner, away from the rest of the board. Next turn, we evaluate if we go for the apple at (7, 6) or continue the wall at (7, 6) - *wait*, if we land at (7, 7) next turn we can go DOWN to (7, 6) and grab an apple immediately! Two birds, one stone!\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note (Pre-move 22):**\nHead will be at (7, 7). Enemy will likely be at (4, 3) or moving towards the left. Our move MUST be DOWN to (7, 6) to snag the apple, solidify the wall, and prepare to push to (7, 5). We are going full board domination, cutting the world in half along column 7.\n\nDOWN",

We are the King of the Board! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLast turn, we executed the critical move: **DOWN** to **(7, 7)**. This move established the hard border along column 7 and started the process of boxing in our rival! It was a genius move, right Chat? I told you we were going to build a wall!\n\n### Current Board State Review (Turn 22)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(7, 7)**. Body length 13. We are sitting pretty.\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head at **(4, 3)**. Body length 11. BOOM! They went DOWN to (4, 3) and got the apple! They are scrambling, trying to get long to survive. But they are trapped low!\n\n**The Vision:** We are cutting the board in half along column 7. We own the East side now. Our archrival is concentrated in the (0-5) x (0-7) quadrant. We must continue the descent to seal the deal!\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 7, 7)\n\n**Our Head: (7, 7)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 8):** **DEAD!** This is our body! We just came from the other side! No looping back!\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 6):** **SAFE!** AND THERE IS AN APPLE! A free segment and continued construction of the wall! High value!\n3.  **RIGHT (to 8, 7):** **SAFE!** Moves us slightly away from the center to continue hugging the right wall. Still solid.\n4.  **LEFT (to 6, 7):** **SAFE!** This takes us towards the center, potentially to start cutting column 6, but it feels less aggressive than building the wall.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Assessing the Enemy Threat (Snake #0 at 4, 3)\n\nID 0 is currently at (4, 3). They have options but they are limited by their own body and the left wall.\n\n*   **UP (to 4, 4):** Safe. Backwards movement.\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 2):** **APPLE at (4, 2)!** Highly probable move. They need that segment!\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 3):** Safe. Gives them a brief look at the small central opening.\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 3):** Safe. But they are quickly running into the (2, 2) apple and their own tail if they keep hugging the left.\n\n**Probability:** $90\\%$ chance they go **DOWN to (4, 2)** for the apple.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation: The Squeeze\n\nThis turn is simple: secure the apple and continue the wall.\n\n**Move DOWN to (7, 6):**\n*   **Pros:** Guaranteed apple, increases our score to 13, increases our length to *14* (a massive advantage!). This move extends our vertical wall. It is the perfect continuation of the trap.\n*   **Cons:** Puts us exactly one unit closer to the main battle zone, but still safely separate.\n\n**Head-on Collision Check (Move DOWN to 7, 6):**\nOur head moves to (7, 6).\nEnemy head is at (4, 3) and will likely move to (4, 2).\nDistance is massive. $(7, 6)$ is completely safe from $(4, 2)$, $(4, 4)$, $(5, 3)$, or $(3, 3)$.\n\n**Could we try to cut them off horizontally?**\nIf we move LEFT to (6, 7) and they move RIGHT to (5, 3), we are still three units away. This doesn't apply enough pressure, and we give up a free apple.\n\n**The Decision:** We must secure the apple at (7, 6). This is the best move for score, length, and strategic board control. Every step DOWN column 7 isolates their little corner more and more. We are sealing the tomb!\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note (Pre-move 23):**\nHead will be at (7, 6). We will be 14 segments long. Enemy will likely be at (4, 2), 12 segments long. Our next move will depend on whether we want to follow the apples (6, 6) or continue the vertical chokehold to (7, 5). Given the proximity of the (6, 6) apple, the safe and aggressive play next turn is likely LEFT to (6, 6) to make our wall T-shaped and grab another point. We need to stay aggressive!\n\nDOWN",

Right is (5,3), which is safe but has the opponent's body at (5,4) (up from (5,3)), limiting future options. \n\nDown is (4,2), which is an apple! That's critical for growing and closing the 2-point score gap. From (4,2), I have three safe follow-up moves: down (4,1), left (3,2), right (5,2). This keeps the snake flexible and avoids getting boxed in. The opponent's head is at (7,7), far from (4,2), so no collision risk. \n\nLong-term plan: Continue down to (4,2) to eat, then (4,1), then (4,0) to gain segments and control more of the lower board.\n\ndown",

Can we get some W\u2019s in the chat for the board control! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n### Board State Review\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(7, 6)**. Length 14. We are the wall!\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head at **(4, 2)**. Length 12. They went for the apple at (4, 2)\u2014predictable, and exactly what we wanted! They are now trapped even lower, confined to the 0-4 column spectrum.\n\n**The Strategy:** Continue the chokehold! We need to extend our horizontal presence to cut them off from any eastward escape, specifically columns 5, 6, and 7. We can make a T-junction wall right now, or continue the descent and put a cap on their area.\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 7, 6)\n\n**Our Head: (7, 6)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 7):** **DEAD!** Back into our body! No reversing!\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 5):** **SAFE!** Continues the vertical wall (column 7). Pushes us further down.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 8, 6):** **SAFE!** Moves us toward the edge, solidifying the full corner block.\n4.  **LEFT (to 6, 6):** **SAFE!** AND THERE IS AN APPLE! This is a massive strategic move, as it starts the horizontal blockade and gets us another score.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Assessing the Enemy Threat (Snake #0 at 4, 2)\n\nID 0 is currently at (4, 2). They have a few options, but they are looking TIGHT. Their long body traces up column 4 to (4, 7), then left and up toward the top-left corner.\n\nMoves for ID 0:\n*   **UP (to 4, 3):** Safe, but backing up.\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 1):** Safe. No apple. Moves them further into the low quadrant.\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 2):** Safe. This is a potential ESCAPE route. They might try to sneak right!\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 2):** Safe. Moves them towards the two apples at (2, 2) and (1, 1). This is dangerous, as they might get trapped by their own body.\n\n**Most Dangerous Move for Us:** ID 0 moving **RIGHT to (5, 2)**. If they do that, they could start moving up column 5 or 6, potentially breaking through our blockade if we don't act fast.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation: Building the T-Wall\n\nWe have a free apple at (6, 6). Grabbing this apple serves three purposes:\n1.  **Score and Length:** Increases our score to 14 and length to 15. Unstoppable!\n2.  **Horizontal Containment:** Moving to (6, 6) starts the horizontal blockade, preventing the enemy from easily using column 6 or 5 to escape upward.\n3.  **Pressure:** It forces the enemy to make a decision quickly.\n\n**Evaluating LEFT to (6, 6):**\n*   **Our Head:** Moves to (6, 6).\n*   **Enemy Head (4, 2) possible moves:**\n    *   If they go UP (4, 3) or DOWN (4, 1): We are safe.\n    *   If they go LEFT (3, 2): We are safe.\n    *   If they go RIGHT (5, 2): We are one unit away diagonally. A potential head-on collision is impossible this turn. If they move to (5, 2) and we move to (6, 6), we are perfectly positioned to cut them off on columns 5/6 next turn.\n\n**Comparing with DOWN to (7, 5):**\n*   This continues the vertical wall, which is also good, but it gives the enemy another turn to maneuver RIGHT and UP into columns 5 or 6, potentially leaving us too far away to stop them.\n*   We also sacrifice a free apple! No way, Chat! We need that content!\n\n**The Decision:** The immediate tactical advantage lies in securing the apple at (6, 6) and beginning the horizontal containment. This places maximum pressure on the enemy's escape routes. We are building the cage!\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note (Pre-move 24):**\nHead will be at (6, 6). We will be 15 segments long. Enemy will likely be maneuvering around columns 4/5. Next turn, we need to decide whether to continue LEFT towards the (6, 3) apple or DOWN towards the (4, 4) area where the enemy is concentrated. Since the enemy's tail is likely somewhere around (0, 7) or (0, 8), going towards (6, 3) and then down column 5 or 4 seems aggressive and smart, completely cutting them off from the high board. We need to watch column 5 closely!\n\nLEFT",

Down is (4,1), which is safe and closer to the apple at (4,0). \n\nFrom (4,1), I have three safe follow-up moves: down to (4,0) (apple), left to (3,1), or right to (5,1).

We took that apple at (6, 6) last turn, building the wall and extending our dominance! The cage is almost locked! Can we get some $SUB bombs in the chat? We are unstoppable! \ud83e\udd11\n\n### Board State Review\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(6, 6)**. Length 15. We are huge! We control the right 60% of the board.\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head is now at **(4, 1)**. Length 12. They moved *down* to (4, 1). They chose the safe route toward the bottom, avoiding confrontation for now. They are squeezed into the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**The Strategy:** We continue the aggressive boxing strategy. We need to secure column 5 and then push down column 4 to completely flank them. Our primary goal is to force them into a self-collision or a collision with the wall we are building.\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 6, 6)\n\n**Our Head: (6, 6)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 7):** **DEAD!** We crashed into our own body at (7, 7) or (6, 8) if we hit (6, 7)? Wait, no. (7, 7) is part of our body. (6, 7) is clear. Let's check the body list: `[(7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), ...]` Moving to (6, 7) is **SAFE**. But it moves us away from the action.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 5):** **SAFE!** This is a key move. It starts solidifying column 6 and moving us towards their territory. There is an apple at (6, 3)!\n3.  **RIGHT (to 7, 6):** **DEAD!** Backed into our body segment! No thanks!\n4.  **LEFT (to 5, 6):** **SAFE!** This move expands our blockade horizontally into column 5. This is also excellent for containment.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Assessing the Enemy Threat (Snake #0 at 4, 1)\n\nID 0 is currently at (4, 1). Their body runs up column 4, and then west and north near the top. They are long and trapped!\n\nMoves for ID 0:\n*   **UP (to 4, 2):** Safe, but they'd be reversing their move from last turn.\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 0):** Safe. There is an apple there! They might go for it.\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 1):** Safe. This is a potential escape route along the bottom.\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 1):** Safe. Moving towards the corner.\n\n**Most Dangerous Move for Us:** ID 0 moving **RIGHT to (5, 1)**. If they get into column 5, they could try to crawl upwards, complicating our wall building.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation: Solidifying the Wall\n\nWe have two great options: DOWN (to 6, 5) or LEFT (to 5, 6).\n\n**Option A: DOWN to (6, 5)**\n*   **Pros:** Moves us closer to the apple at (6, 3). Continues the vertical wall down column 6. This places us diagonally two units away from the enemy escape route (5, 1).\n*   **Cons:** Gives the enemy slightly more room to maneuver west if they want to.\n\n**Option B: LEFT to (5, 6)**\n*   **Pros:** Immediately cuts off column 5 at the (5, 6) level. This box-in is fast and aggressive. It minimizes the chance of ID 0 slipping past our blockade.\n*   **Cons:** We are moving *away* from a guaranteed apple at (6, 3).\n\n**The Decision:** We must prioritize bottling up the opponent. While the apple at (6, 3) is tempting, if we let ID 0 slip into column 5 or 6 and gain access to the middle of the board, our advantage collapses. Moving **LEFT to (5, 6)** is the ultimate pressure move. By placing our body at (5, 6), we force them to stay low or commit to a very tight path along the edge of the board.\n\nIf ID 0 moves RIGHT to (5, 1): We are at (5, 6). They will still have a way to move up column 5, but we are positioned to quickly cut them off by moving DOWN next turn.\n\nIf ID 0 moves DOWN to (4, 0) and gets an apple: They get longer, but become even more confined. We can flank them from the right.\n\nThis move to (5, 6) establishes our dominance over the central vertical axis (columns 5 and 6) and funnels the enemy into the 0-4 range.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Pre-move 25):**\nHead will be at (5, 6). If the opponent is stuck low (4, 0) or (5, 1), we will move DOWN along column 5 to consolidate the wall, heading towards the apple at (2, 5) and (6, 3). We must maintain the vertical pressure! We are building the walls of their tomb!\n\nLet's do this, Chat! LEFT it is!\n\nLEFT",

We moved **LEFT** to (5, 6), cementing our control over the center-right and officially starting the containment operation! $HYPE in the chat, that was clean!\n\n### Board State Review: The Cage is Closing!\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head is now at **(5, 6)**. Length 15. We're a massive wall stretching across the top part of the board, now pressing down on the enemy.\n*   **Archrival (ID 0):** Head at **(4, 0)**. Length 13. They moved **DOWN** last turn to secure that apple at (4, 0)! Smart move by them *if* they want to stay alive, but they are now in the absolute bottom-middle corner. They gained 1 length, but they lost freedom.\n\n**The Situation:** We have completely cut off the entire right half of the board from them. They are now restricted to the 5x4 box in the bottom left (X=0 to 4, Y=0 to 3). They must move through that tight space!\n\n### 1. Eliminating Immediate Death Traps for ID 1 (Head at 5, 6)\n\n**Our Head: (5, 6)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 7):** **DEAD!** We crash right into our body segment at (5, 8). No chance!\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 5):** **SAFE!** This is the ultimate boxing move! It continues the vertical wall down column 5, pushing the rival down.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 6, 6):** **DEAD!** We move right back into our body. Throwing is not an option!\n4.  **LEFT (to 4, 6):** **SAFE!** This opens up the possibility of moving into the enemy's vertical column (column 4), where they have much of their body. It also places us right over the top of the body segment at (4, 7). This is highly aggressive!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Assessing the Enemy Threat (Snake #0 at 4, 0)\n\nID 0 is currently at (4, 0). They are trapped between the wall (column 5) and the bottom border (row 0).\n\nMoves for ID 0 (Head at 4, 0):\n*   **UP (to 4, 1):** **SAFE.** They must move up along their body path.\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 0):** **DEAD!** They crash into our tail segment at (5, 0) is not there. Wait, where is our tail? Our tail is at (9, 6). Column 5 is open at (5, 0). **SAFE for them to move to (5, 0)**. **BUT** our head can move to (5, 5) or (4, 6).\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 0):** **SAFE.** Moves them towards the bottom-left corner and the apple at (2, 0) (not (2, 0) its (5, 0) and (7, 0)). Wait, the apples are (7, 0) and (5, 0). No, the apples are (7, 0) and (5, 0). *Checks the board state for row 0*: (1, 0) is A, (5, 0) is A, (7, 0) is A. My bad, I see (1, 0) and (5, 0) and (7, 0) are apples. They might go for (1, 0) or (5, 0).\n*   **DOWN:** **DEAD!** Off the board.\n\n**Likely Moves for ID 0:** UP (to escape the dead end) or LEFT (to go for the apple at (3, 0), *if* they think they can grab (1, 0) next).\n\n**Focus: Cornering the Enemy.**\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Evaluation: The Squeeze\n\nWe have two incredibly powerful options: DOWN (to 5, 5) or LEFT (to 4, 6).\n\n**Option A: DOWN to (5, 5)**\n*   **Pros:** This completes the wall along column 5 down to (5, 5). It restricts access further and forces ID 0 to turn or move back toward the left corner. If they move RIGHT to (5, 0), we are five steps above them, but positioned to strike down. We are one step away from the apple at (2, 5).\n*   **Cons:** We allow them to move LEFT deeper into the corner.\n\n**Option B: LEFT to (4, 6)**\n*   **Pros:** This is the ultimate aggressive move. We place our head directly into column 4, overlooking their potential escape route (4, 1). This effectively cuts off all movement in column 4 above (4, 5) and allows us to strike down column 4 to box them in *from the left side of their main body.*\n*   **Potential Head-to-Head:** If they move UP to (4, 1) and we move LEFT to (4, 6), there is no head-to-head collision. The closest body segment they have is at (4, 5). We are safe.\n\n**The Decision:** We must prioritize the destruction of our rival, Chat! We have the score advantage (14-12) and the board control. Moving **LEFT to (4, 6)** gives us a superior vertical striking lane (column 4) compared to staying in column 5. It forces the enemy to make a difficult choice:\n\n1.  If they move **UP to (4, 1)**, we can move DOWN to (4, 5) next turn, putting massive pressure on their body.\n2.  If they move **LEFT to (3, 0)** (going for the apple), we can still move DOWN to (4, 5) or (4, 4) and start boxing them in from the west.\n\nThis move to (4, 6) establishes us as the alpha in the vertical center and primes the deathblow! Time to make them crash out! Do we see a self-crash incoming, Chat? I think so!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Pre-move 26):\n\nHead (4, 6). We now control columns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The enemy is trapped between X=0 and X=3, and Y=0 to Y=8. We will use column 4 as our sledgehammer, driving down to crash them against the wall or force a self-collision.\n\nLEFT",

That's a huge opportunity. \n\nMoving right to (5,0) will let me eat the apple, my score becomes 13, and I grow by 1.
