This suggests Snake #0 is moving upward toward the apple at **(4, 3)**.\n  \n#### Apple's Positions:\n1. **(6, 7)**: Far away and not immediately relevant.\n2. **(1, 6)**: Far away, would require significant risk and time to attempt.\n3. **(3, 6)**: Strategically promising, as it's within my reach in 4 moves (assuming no obstructions). Enemy Snake #0 is farther and would need at least 6 moves.\n4. **(7, 6)**: Far away and too risky, as it's distant and near walls.\n5. **(2, 0)**: Very far and inefficient to head toward.\n\n#### Observations:\n1. **Priority Target Apple:**\n   - The apple at **(4, 3)** is highly desirable but **Enemy Snake #0** has only one move left to acquire it. It\u2019s highly likely this apple will be gone by my next turn, so it should no longer be a target.\n\n2. **Next Best Target:**\n   - The apple at **(3, 6)** is a more viable option now. It\u2019s relatively close, and I'm in a favorable position to get there first. By moving upward, I can begin heading to **(3, 6)** while staying in a safe lane.\n\n3. **Collision Risk:**\n   - I should avoid moving into the space at **(3, 3)** in the next couple of turns, as that places me near **Enemy Snake #0**\u2019s body. This avoids unnecessary risk of entanglement.\n\n4. **Safe Movement Planning:**\n   - To ensure that no wall collisions occur, I will carefully plan each step toward **(3, 6)** while retaining flexibility to pivot in case new information arises.\n\n#### Path Execution Plan:\nIf I begin moving toward **(3, 6)**:\n1. I move **UP** to **(3, 3)**.\n2. Next, I proceed along the `y`-axis until **(3, 6)**.\n3. Keep observing **Enemy Snake #0\u2019s** movements if they diverge.\n\n### Determined Move - **UP**\n- By moving upward to **(3, 3)**, I align myself with the only viable apple target while staying safe from collisions. Snake #0 will likely snatch the **(4, 3)** apple, and this move positions me safely for my next target.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nI will:\n1. Reassess after Snake #0 likely eats **(4, 3)**.\n2. Continue moving toward **(3, 6)** unless a new strategy becomes evident.\n3.

The apple at **(3, 6)** remains the most viable target for me. It is **3 moves away** and currently unthreatened by the enemy snake.\n4. The other apples are far away or inefficient to pursue at this time:\n   - **(6, 7)** and **(7, 6)** are distant.\n   - **(1, 6)** would take longer to reach, and there\u2019s a risk of collision with the enemy snake if both snakes end up moving west.\n   - **(2, 0)** is too far and irrelevant for now.\n\n---\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Best Target Apple:** The apple at **(3, 6)** remains my key focus. It is directly ahead of me and can be reached in a straight line.\n2. **Collision Avoidance:**\n   - To avoid enemy Snake #0, I must steer clear of moving into spaces it might occupy.

No immediate threats are present around my planned trajectory. I will remain cautious in case Enemy Snake #0 changes its direction after eating the apple.\n\n---\n\n### Path Execution Plan:\nTo pursue the apple at **(3, 6)**:\n1.

I will maintain my course and move **UP** this turn to advance toward the apple at **(3, 6)**.\n2. After this move, I will be at **(3, 5)**, one move away from the target apple. At that time, I will reassess and confirm there are no interfering threats before grabbing the apple.\n3.

However, our paths may intersect if I pursue the apple at **(6, 5)**.\n\n3. **Apple Distribution**:\n   - The remaining apples are now located at:\n     - **(7, 6)** (near the enemy snake)\n     - **(6, 5)** (closer to me than any other apple)\n     - **(2, 0)** (distant but relatively uncontested)\n     - **(9, 8)** (far and close to the enemy snake)\n\n   - The apple at **(6, 5)** is now my best target because:\n     1. It\u2019s the closest in terms of **Manhattan Distance** (|6-1| + |5-6| = 6), compared to the other apples.\n     2. It may soon be contested by the enemy snake, making it important for me to get there quickly.\n\n#### **Movement Goals This Turn**:\n- My trajectory should head toward **(6, 5)** in a deliberate path while ensuring that:\n  1. I avoid running into my own body.\n  2. I stay clear of Snake #0 and remain ready to change course if it veers toward the same target.\n  3. I maintain flexibility for dynamic decision-making in case new apples spawn after I begin moving.\n\n- **Key Observations**:\n  - Moving **UP** to **(1, 7)** is not ideal, as the apple at **(6, 5)** is below my current position, and moving up adds unnecessary steps.\n  - Moving **DOWN** to **(1, 5)** is my best move this turn:\n    - It positions me closer to **(6, 5)** while remaining safe.\n    - It avoids my body by heading into open space.\n    - It avoids unnecessary interaction with the enemy snake.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategic Plan for Subsequent Moves**:\n1. After moving **DOWN** to **(1, 5)**:\n   - Continue toward **(6, 5)** by moving **RIGHT** as necessary, while avoiding obstacles.\n2. Remain vigilant about Snake #0's movements.\n   - If Snake #0 deviates toward **(6, 5)**, reevaluate whether it\u2019s safer to pursue a different apple instead.\n   - Keep an eye on new apple spawns, which could change the priority target mid-path.\n\n---\n\n#### **Final Decision**:\n**Move: DOWN**"

Here's my updated thought process:\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of the Current Situation:**\n\n#### 1. **My Snake Position and State**:\n- My head is at **(1, 5)**, and my body extends to **[(1, 6), (2, 6)]**.\n- My body does not block my immediate movements except for going backward into **(1, 6)**, which would result in death.\n\n#### 2. **Enemy Snake Position**:\n- Enemy Snake #0's head is still at **(6, 6)**, with its body at **[(6, 7), (5, 7)]**. It is heading toward the apples to the right, near **(9, 8)** and possibly **(7, 6)** or **(6, 5)**.\n- Snake #0 is not an immediate danger to me, as it is still far from my location. However, there is overlap in our high-priority target area (the apple at **(6, 5)**), so I need to be decisive about reaching it.\n\n#### 3. **Apple Distribution**:\n- Apples are located at:\n  - **(7, 6)**: Close to the enemy snake and in the same region as Snake #0\u2019s head.\n  - **(6, 5)**: The nearest apple to me and my current top priority as it\u2019s open and within reach.\n  - **(2, 0)**: Far to the bottom-left, unlikely contested.\n  - **(9, 8)**: Far to the top-right, closer to Snake #0 and lower priority.\n  - **(4, 8)**: Further and in the mid-top of the board, also closer to Snake #0.\n\n#### 4. **Threat Awareness**:\n- No immediate threats surround my snake, so my focus is to safely progress toward the apple at **(6, 5)**.\n- While Snake #0 may target the same apple, I can likely get there faster than it. If Snake #0 diverges toward me while closing in, I may need to adapt by rerouting toward another apple instead (e.g., **(2, 0)** or any new apple spawn).\n\n---\n\n### **Current Movement Choices:**\n\nFrom my current position at **(1, 5):**\n1. **UP (to 1, 6)**:\n   - Unsafe. Moving upward would result in immediate self-collision with my own body segment at **(1, 6)**. This move is invalid.\n\n2. **DOWN (to 1, 4)**:\n   - Advances closer to the apple at **(6, 5)** while staying in open space and clear of dangers.\n   - Keeps a direct path toward the apple at **(6, 5)** with options to move right toward the target.\n\n3. **LEFT (to 0, 5)**:\n   - Moves away from the target. While safe, moving away from the apple does not serve my current goals.\n   - Limits my progress.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to 2, 5)**:\n   - A strong move that advances directly toward the apple at **(6, 5)** while keeping me safe and in a good position to continue toward the target.\n   - Keeps me on an efficient trajectory for grabbing the apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Plan for this Turn**:\n- I will move **RIGHT (to 2, 5)**.\n  - This move brings me closer to **(6, 5)** while leaving me safe and open for follow-up moves.\n  - On subsequent turns, I plan to continue moving **RIGHT** and then **UP** or **DOWN** as needed to secure the apple.\n  - I'll monitor Snake #0's trajectory and adapt dynamically if it poses an immediate contest for the apple at **(6, 5)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Reminder for Next Turn**:\n- If Snake #0 moves aggressively toward **(6, 5)**, evaluate whether I can safely compete for it. If not, consider rerouting toward either **(2, 0)** or waiting for new apples to spawn.\n- Avoid unnecessary risks around the enemy snake, and always ensure I have escape options.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**:\n**Move: RIGHT**"

This means my snake is moving upward and is located on the left side of the board.\n\n2. **Apple Locations**: \n   - Apples are at **(2, 0)**, **(6, 5)**, **(9, 8)**, **(4, 8)**, and **(9, 6)**. \n   - The closest apples are **(6, 5)** and **(2, 0)**.\n     - **(6, 5)**: This apple is four units away horizontally and one unit away vertically. It\u2019s closer and strategically better because moving toward this apple allows me to remain on the safe bottom-left side of the board while avoiding the edges.\n     - **(2, 0)**: This apple is directly below me, but it\u2019s far away. Moving DOWN for it would risk wasting turns while the competing snake could claim apples elsewhere.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n   - Enemy Snake **#0** has its head at **(8, 6)** and body segments at **[(7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)]**.\n   - Given its position, it\u2019s relatively close to the apple at **(6, 5)**, which means there may be some competition to grab it. However, my position puts me at an advantage (especially if I act efficiently) because I am physically closer to that apple, and the enemy snake\u2019s body obstruction gives me time to approach safely.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - Moving UP to **(2, 7)** avoids walls and facilitates faster progress toward the goal apple at **(6, 5)**.\n   - Moving LEFT would endanger me because it's heading toward the wall.\n   - Moving RIGHT is also a viable option because it reduces distance to the apple horizontally, but it delays vertical movement toward **(6, 5)**, wasting time.\n\n#### General Strategy Consideration:\nPrioritize the most accessible apple and stay away from the top-right section of the board, which is crowded by the enemy snake.

This is a relatively safe position.\n\n2. **Closest Apples and Priorities**:\n   - Apples are located at **(2, 0)**, **(6, 5)**, **(9, 8)**, **(4, 8)**, and **(7, 3)**.\n   - The apple at **(6, 5)** remains the top priority since it is the closest logical target.\n     - To approach it, I must move **upward** once more to start clearing a path to **(6, 5)**.\n     - Moving straight for this apple keeps me away from walls as well as the enemy snake\u2019s body, which is clustered on the right-top side of the board.\n   - The apple at **(2, 0)** is *physically* below me, but it is too far and requires long and inefficient maneuvers that would leave me trailing behind the enemy snake in reaching **(6, 5)** or other apples.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake**:\n   - Snake **#0**'s head is currently at **(9, 6)**, with a body at **[(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)]**. It seems to be lingering closer to the top and headed toward the apple at **(9, 8)** or remaining defensive.\n   - There\u2019s still time to reach **(6, 5)** without interference from the enemy snake. However, the enemy could swerve downward once it clears **(9, 8)** and potentially compete for **(6, 5)**. This reinforces the need to act *quickly.*\n\n4. **Movement Options**:\n   - **UP**: Moving to **(2, 8)** directly positions me closer to the apple at **(6, 5)** via an upward route. This is safe and aligns with my goal.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving to **(3, 7)** is also a legitimate consideration, potentially beginning my horizontal approach to **(6, 5)** early. However, it delays my column alignment with **(6, 5)** and puts me on track to a less efficient diagonal route.\n   - **DOWN** or **LEFT**: These moves are both counterproductive and dangerous, as they take me farther from all apples and would risk running into walls or losing tempo.\n\n---\n\n### General Strategy for Next Moves:\n- Stay in the safe bottom-left portion of the board while making efficient progress toward reachable apples.\n- Use a combination of **UP** and **RIGHT** moves over the next turns to reach **(6, 5)** as efficiently as possible.\n- Monitor the enemy snake to determine if it will compete for **(9, 8)** or make an unexpected shift toward **(6, 5)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Move: UP**"

Movement Options:**\n1. **UP (to (2, 9)):**  \n   - BAD. Moving up puts me in the upper boundary of the board unnecessarily. There are no apples above me or advantages from this move.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (2, 7)):**  \n   - WORST. This backtracking maneuver risks overlap with my own snake's body, cannot lead to any apple, and wastes a turn.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (1, 8)):**  \n   - BAD. Moving left takes me farther away from **all apples** and positions me inefficiently, wasting tempo unnecessarily.  \n\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 8)):**  \n   - BEST. Moving right opens a direct, efficient path toward **(4, 8)** and clears the way toward **(6, 5)**.  \n   - While **(4, 8)** is along the way, it does not force me into a dangerous collision zone (the enemy snake is too far away to contest).\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy for the Next Few Turns:**\n1. Continue prioritizing **(6, 5)** as the main objective. If I can claim the **(4, 8)** apple easily, do so on the way without over-committing to short-term gains.  \n2. Avoid the walls and always provide \u201cexit paths\u201d around my snake.\n3. Monitor enemy snake carefully in case it starts targeting **(6, 5)** after **(9, 8)**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Next Move: RIGHT**"

Moving upward takes me away from all apples, wastes time, and puts me closer to the upper edge of the board where mobility decreases.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (3, 7)):**  \n   - OKAY, BUT NOT IDEAL.

Current Status**\n\n1. **My Position:**  \n   - My snake's head is now at **(4, 8)**, after the successful move to collect the apple.  \n   - My body has now grown to include the previous head position: **[(3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7)]**.  \n\n2. **Apple Priorities:**  \n   - Current apple locations:  \n     - **(2, 0), (6, 5), (7, 3), (0, 3), (6, 0)**  \n   - Now that **(4, 8)** has been consumed, the **next closest apple is (6, 5)**.  \n\n3. **Enemy Snake Information (Snake #0):**  \n   - Enemy snake **#0** currently has its head at **(8, 8)**, with its body trailing behind at **[(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6)]**.  \n   - The enemy snake's movement suggests that it is unlikely to compete directly for the next apple at **(6, 5)** (due to its current position and body configuration).  \n\n4. **Movement Objectives:**  \n   - **Immediate Goal:** Start positioning myself to reach the apple at **(6, 5)**.  \n   - **Path Selection Rules:**  \n     - Avoid approaching walls closely.  \n     - Avoid moving into paths without escape options.  \n     - Maintain access to open areas to ensure flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Evaluation of Movement Options**\n\n1. **UP (to (4, 9)):**  \n   - BAD. This move pushes me toward the top boundary with no apples or clear pathways from that position. It restricts my movement unnecessarily.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (4, 7)):**  \n   - **GOOD.** This move positions me closer to the apple at **(6, 5)** by heading in the general direction of the apple.  \n   - It also avoids danger zones and keeps me surrounded by open paths for flexibility.  \n\n3. **LEFT (to (3, 8)):**  \n   - BAD. Moving left would collide with my own body, resulting in immediate death.  \n\n4. **RIGHT (to (5, 8)):**  \n   - OKAY, BUT NOT IDEAL. While this move shifts me to the right toward **(6, 5)**, it is less optimal as it forces a more convoluted path down to the target apple compared to a downward move.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Strategic Overview for Next Few Turns**\n\n1. **Short-Term Target:**  \n   - After moving closer to **(6, 5)**, continue planning efficient moves to consume that apple.  \n\n2. **Safety Considerations:**  \n   - Monitor enemy snake movement to avoid paths that could result in a collision.  \n   - Always leave escape routes open when entering tighter sections of the board.  \n\n3. **Next Apple After (6, 5):**  \n   - Based on positioning, the apple at **(7, 3)** may be the next highest-priority target.  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Move: DOWN**"

This cell is part of my body.  \n\n2. **DOWN (to (4, 4))**:  \n   - REASONABLE BUT LESS EFFICIENT. Moving down keeps me safe and in open territory but moves me farther from the **(6, 5)** apple.  \n   - I would need additional steps to circle back.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (3, 5))**:  \n   - BAD. Moving left does not bring me closer to any apple and leads toward confined spaces, reducing flexibility.  \n\n4. **RIGHT (to (5, 5))**:  \n   - **BEST MOVE.**  \n   - Advances horizontally toward the apple at **(6, 5)**.  \n   - Keeps immediately adjacent cells open and accessible.  \n   - Safe since there are no obstacles or threats from other snakes or walls.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- After moving **RIGHT** to **(5, 5)**:\n  - Reassess if heading directly to **(6, 5)** is still optimal based on any changes to the board (the enemy snake\u2019s moves, etc.).\n  - If no threats emerge, move RIGHT again to claim the apple.\n  - Stay cautious of potential bottlenecks during the approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Move**  \n**RIGHT**"
