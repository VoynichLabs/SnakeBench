          "rationale": "Okay, let's think about this. My snake is currently at (5, 2) after moving right. I want to get to (5, 5) which has an apple. The enemy snake is at (1, 8). I need to avoid collisions with the walls, the enemy snake, and myself.\n\nIf I move up, I\u2019ll go to (6, 2) which is not close to any apple. Moving down to (4, 2) will also not bring me closer to an apple. Moving left (to 4, 2) isn\u2019t ideal either. Moving right is the only viable option.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Prioritize moving towards apples, while avoiding collisions.\n\nRIGHT",
