In snake games, the tail moves forward unless I eat an apple; since I did not eat an apple moving down (no apple at (2,8)), the tail would move up, so (2,9) should be free. So moving UP to (2,9) is possible and safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2, 7): Coordinates are in range. (2,7) is empty ('.'). Safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1, 8): Empty, no immediate threat.\n\n- RIGHT to (3, 8): No snake, no apple, possible.\n\nWhich move is best?\n\n- The apple at (7,9) is still far right on the top row. Moving UP to (2,9) puts me back near the top row.\n\n- Moving RIGHT (3,8) puts me closer to the cluster of apples at y=3 and x=3-8.\n\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT might take me further from the apples.\n\nPotential danger:\n\n- Enemy snake body at (2,6). So moving DOWN twice would place me (2,6) which is occupied by enemy body \u2014 unsafe.\n\n- Moving DOWN one step to (2,7) is safe.\n\nGiven the option, moving UP to (2,9) is safe.\n\nIs moving UP to (2,9) good strategy?\n\n- Yes, moving UP returns me to a familiar safe position.\n\n- Then I can try going RIGHT along the top row to reach apple (7,9).\n\nAlso, since my tail vacated (2,9), moving UP there is safe.\n\nPlan for next turn: From (2,9) move RIGHT towards the apple at (7,9).\n\nDecision: Move UP.\n\nNext move: UP"
