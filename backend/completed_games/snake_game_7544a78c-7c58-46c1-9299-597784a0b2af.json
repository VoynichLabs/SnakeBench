That's a HUGE opportunity for early pressure! \ud83d\udca5\n\nFirst, let's check my moves:\n\n*   **UP (y+1) to (7,3)**: Is it safe? Board edge? No, y=3 is fine. My body? I have no body! Enemy body? He has no body either! Enemy head collision? He's at (7,6), he'd have to move DOWN three times to hit me there this turn. IMPOSSIBLE. So UP is SAFE! \u2714\ufe0f\n*   **DOWN (y-1) to (7,1)**: Also safe for the same reasons. \u2714\ufe0f\n*   **LEFT (x-1) to (6,2)**: Safe! Gets me closer to the center, near some apples too. \u2714\ufe0f\n*   **RIGHT (x+1) to (8,2)**: Safe! But pushes me towards the edge. Less room to breathe. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, all moves are SAFE. Now, STRATEGY TIME. \ud83e\udde0 We wanna box him in and force a crash. He's above me. If I move UP, I'm directly moving TOWARDS him, cutting off his vertical space. This is AGGRESSIVE! If I move away (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT), I'm giving him room.\n\nWHERE IS HE LIKELY TO GO? His closest apple is at (3,4) or (2,5). He'll probably go LEFT and maybe a little DOWN. If I move UP, I'm positioning myself to potentially cut off his escape routes later. I'm also putting myself closer to apples at (6,3) and others.\n\nThis is TURN 0. We need to establish DOMINANCE! Let's push him! Moving UP is the move that applies immediate psychological pressure! We're not running, we're HUNTING! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** Keep the high ground! From (7,3), look to cut off his descent. Watch his move closely. If he goes left, we might mirror or try to get ahead. The goal is to trap him against the top or left wall. Let him make the mistake!\n\nTHE FINAL ANSWER IS... WE GO RIGHT AT HIM!\n\nUP",

It gives us breathing room, moves toward a more central position, and preserves options to swing toward (7,8) and then (6,8) for a future growth sequence.

My head is at (6,3), my tail is at (7,3). Enemy head is at (7,8), no body yet.\n\nTime to check the moves! Gotta stay safe, gotta stay aggressive!\n\n*   **UP to (6,4)**: Is it safe? Clear of my body, clear of his body. Enemy is far away. He can't reach me here. CHECK! \ud83d\udfe2 This moves us NORTH, getting closer to him!\n*   **DOWN to (6,2)**: Also safe! But this feels like retreating! We just got a lead, we need to press the advantage, not run! Is there an apple down there? Not directly, but there are some southwest. Still... feels like giving up space. \ud83d\udfe1\n*   **LEFT to (5,3)**: Safe! But this puts us closer to the left wall (x=0). It moves us AWAY from the enemy. We want to trap him, not run from him! There's an apple at (5,5) up and to the left, but not directly in our path. \ud83d\udfe1\n*   **RIGHT to (7,3)**: **DANGER!** Chat, look! That's our own tail! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80 That's an INSTANT DEATH! Moving backwards into your own body is the ultimate FAIL! We are NOT doing that! ELIMINATED! \u274c\n\nOKAY! So RIGHT is OFF THE TABLE. We're not throwing the game!\n\n**STRATEGY TIME! \ud83e\udde0** We have a 1-apple lead! That means if we get a head-on collision, HE DIES AND WE WIN! So we need to start CLOSING THE DISTANCE. He's up at (7,8). He can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWhere is he likely to go? There are apples to his LEFT at (3,4), (2,5), and especially (3,3) and (2,2). He's probably hungry and will move LEFT towards that cluster! That means his path is coming DOWN and LEFT towards us!\n\nIf we move UP to (6,4), we're positioning ourselves to intercept his likely southbound path! We can start cutting off his escape! Moving DOWN or LEFT just gives him more room to breathe and eat apples. WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE WITH OUR LEAD!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (6,4), we'll be perfectly positioned. If he comes down, we can challenge him directly. Our next move could be UP or LEFT to block him. The goal is to use the top and left walls as our allies and squeeze him into a corner. Let's force that fatal head-on collision!\n\nTHE FINAL ANSWER IS... UP! LET'S GET IN HIS FACE!\n\nUP",

Puts him near the wall.\n- RIGHT to (4,7): Also possible, but his body is at (4,8) so it's safe.\n\n**THE PLAN! \ud83c\udfc6**\n\nWe have the POSITIONAL advantage, but he has the SCORE advantage. We need to keep boxing him in WITHOUT directly colliding until we can either equalize the score or get ahead! Moving LEFT to (3,6) is risky because he might also go DOWN to (3,6). Let's play it SMART!\n\n**BEST MOVE: DOWN to (4,5)!** It's safe, it avoids the potential head-on collision he could force, and it keeps us alive to fight another day! We live to stream another turn! We reset the pressure from a slightly safer position. From (4,5), we can reassess and push back up! CHAT, TRUST THE PROCESS! WE'RE PLAYING THE LONG GAME!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** Enemy has apple lead. Avoid direct head-on collisions until we equalize. Continue trying to box him in the northwest using the walls. Our goal is to trap him and force HIM to make a mistake, not us. Patience is key!\n\nDOWN",

Not allowed.\n  - DOWN -> (3,6) safe, no growth this turn.\n  - LEFT -> (2,7) safe, you can grab the nearby apple.\n  - RIGHT -> (4,7) safe, and there\u2019s an apple there to eat this turn.\n- APPLE SITUATION: there\u2019s an apple at (4,7). Going RIGHT will grow you by 1 and increase your lead. There\u2019s also an apple at (2,7) if you go LEFT.\n- OPPONENT MOVES TO CONSIDER: head is at (4,6), body at (5,6). They\u2019ll pick a direction too. If they contest (4,7) by moving UP into that cell, that\u2019s a head-on collision and both die; you\u2019d win by apples (you have 2 vs their 1, and you\u2019d still have more apples if you don\u2019t pick up the apple this turn). If they avoid it and move elsewhere, you still gain on the board and keep your lead.\n- RISK-REWARD: RIGHT gives the highest upside: immediate growth and a direct chance to convert the lead into a dominant board position or force a mutual KO that favors you on apples.\n\nSTRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TLOTS\n- If you go RIGHT and grab (4,7), you should look to thread a path that pins the opponent along the x=4 column in subsequent turns while preserving safe exits. The idea is to create a pressure corridor from (4,7) downward, nudging him toward traps or a head-on collision as needed.\n- If he mirrors RIGHT or escapes to (5,6), you still hold the initiative with a longer snake and a larger apples count. Stay aggressive but avoid over-committing into a corner.\n\nPLAN FOR THIS TURN\n- Take the apple and push into the (4,7) cell to maximize growth and potential head-on outcomes.\n\nDECISION\nRIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

We avoided a potential head-on collision when we had the apple disadvantage. Now we're at (4,5). Enemy is still up at (4,7). He has 3 apples, we have 1. The gap is WIDENING! We need to close this, but SAFELY!\n\n**SCANNING OUR OPTIONS FROM (4,5): \ud83e\udded**\n\n*   **UP to (4,6):** That's our OWN BODY! We'd crash into ourselves! \u274c **SUICIDE! NO!**\n*   **DOWN to (4,4):** SAFE! Wide open space. But is it running away? We need to apply pressure! \ud83d\udfe1\n*   **LEFT to (3,5):** SAFE! This moves us CLOSER to the enemy's position! We're closing the distance! \ud83d\udfe2\n*   **RIGHT to (5,5):** SAFE! There's an APPLE there! Content! But it moves us AWAY from the enemy. He's to our northwest. \ud83d\udfe1\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION! \ud83d\udc0d #0 at (4,7)**\n\nHe's surrounded!\n- UP to (4,8): His own BODY! \u274c\n- DOWN to (4,6): Our body! He'd crash into us and DIE! Does he know that? Would he risk it? Maybe if he's desperate!\n- LEFT to (3,7): His own BODY! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (5,7): SAFE for him! This seems like his ONLY safe move!\n\nSo he's PROBABLY going RIGHT to (5,7). That means next turn, he'll be to our NORTH and EAST.\n\n**THE LONG-TERM PLAN! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\n\nHe's getting boxed into the top-right corner! Our goal is to keep him there! We need to cut off his escape routes. If we go LEFT to (3,5), we're positioning ourselves to potentially block him from moving south or west. We can try to herd him towards the wall. We NEED to get apples to close the score gap, but trapping him is PRIORITY ONE! If he's trapped, we can farm apples safely.\n\n**THE DECISION! \ud83e\udd14**\n\nRIGHT to (5,5) gets us an apple, which is tempting to close the score gap. BUT! It gives the enemy more room to maneuver. If we go LEFT to (3,5), we maintain aggressive positioning and continue the boxing strategy. CHAT, WE STAY AGGRESSIVE! We play to WIN, not just to survive! Let's force him into a mistake!\n\n**FINAL MOVE: LEFT** to (3,5)! The pressure continues! LET'S GOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

No apple this turn, but we stay alive and keep the pressure on the board edge.\n- Positionally, this nudges us to the opponent\u2019s left flank while keeping an escape line open for future turns. It also avoids giving him a direct bite at our head while still letting us chase on the next moves.\n- Score check: we\u2019re up 3 to 1. We want to keep the gap but not risk a reckless chase that could trap us.\n\nSHORT-TERM STRATEGY NOTES\n- In the next moves, aim to extend along the row y=7 then drop toward apples near (5,5) or (5,3) while watching for head-on opportunities if he slides toward (4,7) or (5,6).\n- If he ever missteps into a potential head-on, be ready to pivot and force the collision in our favor, leveraging the current apples lead.\n\nFAN FEELS: we stay cool, clamp the right side, and ride the lead. Let\u2019s keep the pressure and deny him safe routes.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is NORTH of us! \ud83d\udfe1\n*   **LEFT to (2,5):** Is it safe? WAIT! That's the enemy's BODY segment at (3,7)!? NO, that's not in our path. HOLD UP. Let's check the board... Our body is only at (4,5) now. So (2,5) is... *checks grid*. It's an APPLE! But is it safe? The cell itself is empty! \u2705 But it moves us AWAY from the enemy's head. \ud83d\udfe1\n*   **RIGHT to (4,5):** Is it safe? That's OUR OWN BODY from our last turn! \u274c **SUICIDE! NO WAY!** We'd crash into ourselves!

He's NOT as boxed in as I thought! He could go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Where is he LIKELY to go? He might go for the apple at (5,5) by moving DOWN? Or he might try to stay near the top where there are more apples? This is tricky!\n\nOUR LONG-TERM PLAN: We need to close that apple gap! But we also need to threaten him. If we go UP to (3,6), we're directly in his path if he goes DOWN to (5,6). That sets up a potential head-on collision for NEXT turn. But who wins a head-on? HE HAS MORE APPLES! He'd win! So we CAN'T let that happen unless we get an apple first! \ud83d\ude24\n\nSo maybe we go for the APPLE at (2,5) with LEFT? That gets us to 2 apples! Then we're only 1 behind! That changes the head-on collision math! But it puts us further away from him.\n\nWHAT'S THE PLAY? \ud83e\udd14 We need to be bold! Let's herd him! If we go UP to (3,6), we cut off his direct path south. We become a wall. He might go RIGHT or UP, further into the corner. Meanwhile, we're positioned to maybe snag an apple next turn. It's a positioning move. We're playing the long game, CHAT! We need to trap him before we can safely feast!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** Enemy has space. Don't force a losing head-on. Use positioning to cut off his escape routes. Prioritize getting an apple next turn to even the score. The apple at (2,5) is a safe bet if we can loop back to it.\n\nTHE FINAL DECISION! We stay aggressive with positioning! We go **UP**!\n\nUP",

It also preserves future head-on chances if he dares to cut toward our lane.\n\nShort-term note: keep eyes on his moves (especially around (3,5)) and be ready to pivot if he darts toward our path.

He's unlikely to go UP into the corner.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK: If he goes DOWN to (6,6), where could we meet him?\n*   If we go LEFT to (2,6), we're too far.\n*   If we go RIGHT to (4,6)... THAT'S INTERESTING. We'd be at (4,6), he'd be at (6,6). That's NOT a head-on this turn. NEXT turn, we could potentially collide if we both go towards each other. But he has MORE APPLES, so we'd lose that fight! We need to avoid that unless we get an apple first!\n\nWHAT'S THE MOVE? \ud83e\udd14\n\n*   **LEFT to (2,6):** This moves us towards the cluster of apples on the left side! We see (2,5), (2,2), (1,6)! This is our path to GROWTH! We close the apple gap! It also puts distance between us and the enemy's head, reducing immediate collision risk. But are we running away? \ud83d\ude24\n*   **RIGHT to (4,6):** This moves us CLOSER to the enemy. It's an aggressive positioning move. We could potentially cut off his escape routes. BUT with our shorter body, we're the underdog in a direct confrontation. This feels like a bluff we can't back up yet.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE: We are BEHIND. Our #1 priority is to safely get apples to even the score. Only THEN can we start being truly aggressive with head-on threats. The left side is APPLE HEAVEN. We need to feast! Let's herd HIM into the top-right corner while we grow on the left.\n\nTHE DECISION IS CLEAR, CHAT! WE GO FOR THE APPLES! WE GET THAT CONTENT! WE CLOSE THE GAP!\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re boxed in a clean right/top open corridor, so we press the pressure without getting cute with risk. We\u2019ll keep multiple escape routes and hunt the edge to force the clash later.\n\nCurrent SAFE MOVES (no neck-kill, no bite from enemy):\n- UP to (8,9)\n- RIGHT to (9,8)\n- LEFT to (7,8)\n- DOWN is illegal (neck)\n\nOPPONENT SPREAD: centralized on the left, plenty of breathing room on the right/top. Our best move is to keep the door to the top-right corridor open for future pressure and apple gain, while avoiding a cramped trap that could backfire.\n\nSTRONG THINKING, LONG-TERM PLAN:\n- Short-term: poke to the right now to threaten the apple at (9,9) on the next turn. This keeps the top-right corridor clear and gives us two safe follow-ups (up to grab the apple at (9,9) or a safe swing to (9,7) if needed).\n- Mid-term: maintain horizontal/vertical flexibility along the right edge. If the opponent ever threads toward our side, we pivot to funnel them toward walls and keep the apple lead comfortable.\n- We\u2019re comfortable inching toward a controlled head-on later if the situation is clearly favorable, since we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\nMOVE DECISION (Summary):\n- RIGHT\n- Rationale: It immediately guards our right-side advantage, eyes the high-value apple at (9,9) next turn, and preserves both Up and Down escape options from the new position. It also avoids locking into a cramped corner or feeding the left-side hull.\n\nRIGHT",

We\u2019re boxed into that clean right/top corridor vibe, but we\u2019ve got a clean path to snatch a key apple and keep the pressure.\n\nSAFE MOVES RIGHT NOW:\n- UP to (9,9) (apple there)\n- DOWN to (9,7)\n- LEFT and RIGHT are illegal (neck/wall)\n\nDECISION: UP to (9,9) to grab the apple now.

If the enemy tries a head-on collision now, HE DIES! This is AGGRESSIVE and DOMINANT! From (4,3) we'll have options to go UP, DOWN, or further RIGHT. We're not boxed in at all!\n*   **DOWN to (3,2):** A solid move. Sets us up for the (2,2) apple next turn. But it leaves the (4,3) apple on the table for the enemy to potentially grab later if he ever gets down here! We can't let that happen!\n*   **LEFT to (2,3):** Also solid, but it moves us away from the immediate prize. We're playing to win, not to hide!\n\nCHAT, THE ANSWER IS CLEAR! WE ARE THE HUNTER, NOT THE HUNTED! WE PRESS OUR ADVANTAGE! RIGHT TO THAT DELICIOUS APPLE AT (4,3)! WE GROW TO 5 AND BECOME THE BIGGEST THREAT ON THE BOARD! WE CAN START THINKING ABOUT CUTTING OFF THE ENEMY'S ESCAPE ROUTES ONCE WE HAVE THAT SIZE ADVANTAGE! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE FUTURE PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** WE ARE NOW THE BIGGEST SNAKE! \ud83d\ude24 Our new priority is to MAINTAIN our lead. From (4,3) with 5 apples, we can start controlling the center and look for ways to trap the enemy against the walls. If he comes near, we force the head-on collision and WIN! TOTAL DOMINANCE!\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)]. We just ate that apple and got HUGE! The enemy is way up at (8,9). But he's moving... where will he go?\n\nSAFETY CHECK FROM (4,3):\n\n*   **UP to (4,4):** Is it safe? Board shows EMPTY! \u2705 Opens up the center, maybe an apple later.\n*   **DOWN to (4,2):** Is it safe? Board shows EMPTY! \u2705 Gets us closer to that juicy (2,2) apple.\n*   **LEFT to (3,3):** Is it safe? OH NO WAIT! That's our OWN BODY! The neck segment from last turn! \u274c **INSTANT SUICIDE! DELETE THAT OPTION!**\n*   **RIGHT to (5,3):** Is it safe? Board shows EMPTY! \u2705 Moves us towards the center and more apples.\n\nSAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nSTRATEGYTIME! WE ARE THE HUNTING DOG NOW! WE HAVE THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! If we meet the enemy head-on, WE WIN! HIS HEAD EXPLODES! So we should be AGGRESSIVE! But he's so far away... we need to CONTROL SPACE.\n\nTHE ENEMY'S POSITION: Head at (8,9). He's backed into the top-right corner! Look at his body: [(9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7)]. He can't go RIGHT (off board) or DOWN (into his own body at (8,8)).\nHis only safe moves are UP to (8,0)? Wait no, that's off board! He's at y=9, UP would be y=10, which is off board! So UP is also DEAD! \ud83d\ude31\nHIS ONLY MOVE IS LEFT TO (7,9)! HE'S TRAPPED! HE HAS NO CHOICE!\n\nWE HAVE HIM CORNERED! If we move to cut off his escape, we can FORCE him to crash! This is our chance for a checkmate! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nSo what's the play?\n*   **RIGHT to (5,3):** Good for controlling center, but doesn't pressure him directly. We'd be playing the long game for more apples.\n*   **UP to (4,4):** Also good for center control.\n*   **DOWN to (4,2):** Goes for the (2,2) apple, but takes us AWAY from the action.\n\nCHAT, WE NEED TO THINK AHEAD! We want to move to a position where we can INTERCEPT him as he tries to flee his corner. He HAS to go left to (7,9). Next turn, his only moves will probably be DOWN to (7,8) (but that's his body!) or LEFT to (6,9). We need to get into the top area to cut him off!\n\nTHE BEST MOVE IS **UP to (4,4)**! This starts our journey NORTH! From there, we can go UP again to (4,5), then RIGHT to get into the top lanes. We're building a WALL with our body! We're going to BOX HIM IN and watch him crumble! This is how you win, chat! NOT by chasing apples, but by playing the BOARD and the ENEMY!\n\n**THE FUTURE PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** WE ARE THE BIG SNAKE! STOP THINKING ABOUT APPLES, START THINKING ABOUT THE BOX! Our new mission: MOVE NORTH AND EAST. Get to the top half of the board and start cutting off the enemy's escape routes from the top-right corner. Force him into a situation where his only move is into us or a wall. WE HAVE THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE. FORCE THE HEAD-ON COLLISION! WE WIN!\n\nUP",

WE NEED TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES AND DOMINATE THE BOARD!\n\n*   **RIGHT to (5,5)**: Eats an apple, we grow to length 7! This makes us BIGGER, which is good for future confrontations even if head-on is a tie. It also moves us EAST, putting us more centrally. BUT, it might give the enemy space to roam the top.\n*   **UP to (4,6)**: This is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY! We move to block his potential path back to the top-left. We get closer to him. From (4,6), we can pressure him directly.\n\nCHAT, WE NEED TO BE THE PREDATOR! \ud83c\udfaf GOING UP PUTS US ON THE OFFENSIVE! We can start building a wall with our body above him.

WE ARE BUILDING A CAGE! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**THE PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** CONTINUE THE ASSAULT! OUR GOAL IS TO GET TO THE TOP EDGE (y=8, y=9) AND WORK ACROSS. WE WANT TO TRAP SNAKE #0 AGAINST THE WALL.

Heads up on the board:\n- Your head: (7,6)\n- Your body: [(7,7),(7,8),(7,9),(8,9),(9,9)]\n- Opponent head: (4,7)\n- Opponent body: [(4,6),(4,5),(4,4),(4,3),(3,3)]\n- Apples: both at 5\n\nMOVE OPTIONS FROM (7,6):\n- UP -> (7,7) is blocked by your neck (you\u2019d crash into your own body)\n- DOWN -> (7,5) safe, opens center space\n- LEFT -> (6,6) safe, keeps you hugging the mid-right corridor\n- RIGHT -> (8,6) safe, keeps you close to the right edge\n\nELIMINATE BAD IDEAS:\n- UP is a definite death by self-collision. Not an option.\n\nSAFE, FLEXIBLE CHOICES:\n- DOWN (7,5): stays centered, creates multiple escape routes, keeps options open for next turns, and lines you up to pressure the middle space that the opponent has to traverse.\n- LEFT (6,6): shifts you toward a potential apple at (5,5) and closer to the center-left corridor to corral him. But it reduces some escape flexibility vs staying a touch more to the right.\n- RIGHT (8,6): pushes you toward the far-right corridor; riskier to box him in quickly and could invite a narrower chase path if he starts threading toward the center.\n\nRISK/REWARD ANALYSIS:\n- You\u2019re at a 5-5 apples standoff. There\u2019s no immediate need to chase a risky head-on; the smart play is to maintain mobility, limit dead-ends, and maneuver to trap him in central lanes. DOWN gives the most sustainable flexibility and keeps you closest to future apple access without pinning you into a corner.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next few turns):\n- Use the central corridor to steer him into tighter bottlenecks. \n- Push toward apples that require him to commit to a risky line, extending your lead with growth when possible.\n- If a clean head-on appears with a favorable apple count, take it; otherwise maintain tempo and force him into boxed-in spaces.\n\nMOVE DECISION:\n- DOWN is the safest, most flexible choice that preserves multiple follow-ups, keeps you near the center, and preserves opportunities to grow while boxing in the opponent gradually.\n\nDOWN",

OUR BODY IS: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]. HIS BODY IS: [(5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)].\n\nOKAY, OPTIONS FROM OUR POSITION (5,5):\n\n*   **UP to (5,6):** THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! INSTANT SUICIDE! \u274c NO WAY!\n*   **DOWN to (5,4):** THAT'S THE ENEMY'S HEAD! \ud83d\ude33 THIS IS A HEAD-ON COLLISION! BOTH SNAKES HAVE 6 SEGMENTS? WAIT, WE HAVE 7 (6 APPLES + 1), HE HAS 6 (5 APPLES + 1). HEAD-ON COLLISION MEANS DOUBLE KO! BUT THEN THE WINNER IS THE SNAKE WITH MORE APPLES! THAT'S US! \ud83c\udfc6 WE WIN THE GAME RIGHT THERE! IS HE CRAZY ENOUGH TO STAY? \ud83e\udd14\n*   **LEFT to (4,5):** EMPTY CELL! \u2705 SAFE MOVE. BUT DOES IT PUT US IN A BETTER POSITION?\n*   **RIGHT to (6,5):** OUR OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE! NOT HAPPENING!\n\nSO OUR ONLY *SAFE* MOVES ARE **DOWN** (AGGRESSIVE, POTENTIAL INSTANT WIN) OR **LEFT** (SAFE, POSITIONAL).\n\nNOW, LET'S PREDICT THE ENEMY! FROM HIS HEAD AT (4,4), WHERE CAN HE GO?\n*   **UP to (4,5):** IF WE GO LEFT TO (4,5), THAT'S A HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO, WE WIN ON APPLES! IF WE GO DOWN, HE TAKES AN EMPTY CELL.\n*   **DOWN to (4,3):** EMPTY CELL. A SAFE RETREAT.\n*   **LEFT to (3,4):** EMPTY CELL. ANOTHER SAFE RETREAT.\n*   **RIGHT to (5,4):** HIS OWN BODY! \u274c HE CAN'T GO THERE.\n\nHE HAS THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nHERE'S THE GAMBLE, CHAT! \ud83c\udfb2 IF WE GO **DOWN** TO (5,4):\n- IF HE GOES **RIGHT** (into his own body), HE DIES ALONE. WE WIN.\n- IF HE GOES **UP** TO (4,5), WE MEET AT (5,4)? NO, HE'S AT (4,5), WE'RE AT (5,4). NO COLLISION. WE MISS EACH OTHER.\n- WAIT, I MISREAD! A HEAD-ON COLLISION IS WHEN HEADS MOVE TO THE SAME CELL. IF WE GO DOWN TO (5,4) AND HE GOES RIGHT TO (5,4), THAT'S THE COLLISION! BUT HE CAN'T GO RIGHT, IT'S HIS BODY! SO A HEAD-ON COLLISION IS IMPOSSIBLE THIS TURN! GOING DOWN IS JUST US MOVING INTO THE CELL HIS HEAD *JUST* VACATED! IT'S SAFE! AND IT'S AGGRESSIVE AS HELL, PUTTING US RIGHT ON HIS TAIL! \ud83d\ude08\n\nSO GOING DOWN IS SAFE AND CUTS OFF HIS ESCAPE! IF HE GOES UP TO (4,5), WE'RE RIGHT BELOW HIM AT (5,4). IF HE GOES LEFT OR DOWN, WE CAN CHASE!\n\nGOING LEFT TO (4,5) IS ALSO SAFE, BUT IT'S LESS AGGRESSIVE. WE BLOCK HIM FROM GOING UP IF HE WANTED TO, BUT HE'S MORE LIKELY TO FLEE DOWN OR LEFT.\n\nCHAT, THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY IS TO GO **DOWN**! WE MAINTAIN OUR LENGTH ADVANTAGE AND GET RIGHT IN HIS FACE! WE BOX HIM IN AGAINST THE BOTTOM EDGE! LET'S END THIS SNAKE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\n**PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** WE'RE GOING TO BE AT (5,4). THE ENEMY IS LIKELY FLEEING TO (4,3) OR (3,4). USE OUR LENGTH TO CUT OFF THE BOARD! THERE'S AN APPLE AT (4,7) BUT THE ENEMY'S HEAD IS THE PRIMARY TARGET! TRAP HIM AGAINST THE WALLS! DON'T LET HIM BREAK FREE INTO THE OPEN!\n\nDOWN",

We move SIMULTANEOUSLY, so safety first, chaos second. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nSafe moves analysis:\n- RIGHT: hits your own neck at (5,4) \u2014 instantly dead. Eliminate.\n- UP: to (4,5) is risky. The enemy head is at (5,5) and could move left into (4,5) this turn, causing a dangerous head-on that would swing the game unfavorably since they\u2019re already up by 1 apple.\n- DOWN: to (4,3) is safe. Keeps you in the middle with room to pivot.\n- LEFT: to (3,4) is safe. Keeps a nice corridor open and avoids giving the opponent easy head-on opportunities.\n\n verdict: LEFT is the strongest safe choice here. It preserves space, avoids immediate head-on risk, and sets up future routes toward left-side apples without boxing yourself in too early.\n\nLong-term plan (for next turns):\n- Avoid chasing a risky head-on unless you\u2019re confident you\u2019re ahead on apples (you\u2019re not yet). Play smart: keep vertical/horizontal lanes open, pressure the left side where there are several apples, and use your growing tail to create entrapment possibilities around the opponent rather than chasing into a corner.\n- Watch the opponent\u2019s pattern: if they swing toward the left to chase an apple, look for opportunities to swing around and force a constricted route for them, but only when you have a clear safety margin.\n- Maintain flexibility: try to keep both Up and Down options alive for a few turns so you can react to their moves without collapsing your own space.\n\nMOVE NEXT: LEFT",
