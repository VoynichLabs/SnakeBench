DOWN to (2,2): The enemy snake is near but (2,2) itself is free. Potentially risky as enemy is on row 2.\n\nGiven the objective to maximize points and the current closest apple being at (0,3), the safest and most rewarding move is to continue LEFT to (1,3), then next turn move LEFT again to (0,3) apple to eat.\n\nHowever, since your last move was \"LEFT\" and your last rationale also concluded LEFT was the best move, I should check if any new information or positions changed. The map in the initial description places you at (1,3) with body [(2,3), (3,3)], but in the updated description you are at (2,3) after the last LEFT move, with body at [(3,3), (3,4)]\u2014this might be a slight inconsistency but I'll trust the last info.\n\nAssuming last move was LEFT, now at (2,3), going LEFT again to (1,3) is good.\n\nBut safer than going LEFT twice, maybe taking a step UP first?\n\nIs there any immediate threat or better reward going UP to (2,4)? There's no apple there, but it opens options to aim for the cluster on top row after eating (0,3).\n\nI conclude the best next move is LEFT to (1,3).\n\nStrategy:\n\n- Next turn, go LEFT again to eat (0,3).\n- Then, plan path upwards and rightwards to the cluster at (3,9), (4,9), (6,9).\n- Avoid enemy snake near rows 2 and potentially 3.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The map and positions say:\n\n- Head at (0,3)\n- Body at [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nBut the info also says your last move was LEFT to (1,3), so now you should be at (0,3), which is where the apple at (0,3) presumably was \u2014 but I don't see an apple at (0,3) in the apple list.\n\nApples are at (3,9), (4,9), (6,9), (9,7), and (8,0).\n\nIt looks like the previous analysis imagined an apple at (0,3), but none exists; there is no apple at (0,3).\n\nThe board map doesn't show an apple at (0,3) either.\n\nCurrently, your snake's head is at (0,3), body at (1,3), (2,3), (3,3).\n\nApples are at (3,9), (4,9), (6,9), (9,7), (8,0).\n\nThe previous notes mention your snake at (2,3) with body [(3,3), (3,4)], which conflicts with the current description. So let's rely on the most recent map and snake state:\n\n- Your head: (0,3)\n- Body: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nEnemy snake #1:\n\n- Head: (2,2)\n- Body: [(3,2), (4,2)]\n\nYou need to find a safe path toward apples.\n\nFrom (0,3), the possible moves are:\n\n- LEFT to (-1,3): illegal, wall -> death\n- RIGHT to (1,3): occupied by your body -> death\n- UP to (0,4): empty as per the map? Row 4 is empty.\n- DOWN to (0,2): Seems free (based on map)\n\nSo only UP or DOWN are safe (LEFT and RIGHT are not safe).\n\nLet\u2019s consider both:\n\n- UP (0,4): A free space, heading towards higher y and eventually top of board where apples are located (3,9), (4,9), (6,9), and (9,7). Makes sense to go upwards to get in line with these apples.\n\n- DOWN (0,2): No apple nearby, but maybe easier path? Risk of enemy snake at (2,2) somewhat near, but you\u2019re at (0,2), so you can avoid. Less direct to apples.\n\nFrom (0,3), going UP to (0,4) looks safest and best to move towards top apples cluster.\n\nPlan:\n\n- Go UP to (0,4), then UP again to get close to row 7-9.\n- Then gradually move right towards apples at (3,9), (4,9), (6,9), and (9,7).\n- Meanwhile avoid enemy snake at column 2 on rows 2-4.\n\nSo:\n\n- Next move: UP\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue UP or move RIGHT once safe to approach apples on top row.

          "rationale": "Currently, my snake's head is at (6,8) after moving down in the last turn (from (6,9)). Let's verify the current situation and possible next moves.\n\n**Board recap:**  \n- My body is trailing behind, must avoid hitting myself.  \n- Apples left: (9,7), (9,8), (0,1), (3,7)  \n- Enemy snake: at (8,5) with body below; no immediate threat nearby.  \n- The \"T\" on board indicate threats or occupied cells: better to avoid.\n\nFrom (6,8), possible moves are:\n\n- UP to (6,9): checking last turn, (6,9) had my head previously, but now it's available, since snake moved down. However, (6,9) location in last board is occupied by \"T\"? No, previously it was my head, now that I moved down, the tail should have moved forward. But from the board, row 9 col 6 was my last head position. Actually, checking if (6,9) is occupied.\n\nGiven the snake moved down last turn, the tail moved forward, freeing (6,9).\n\nGiven that, (6,9) is now empty or maybe \"T\". Let's look at the board row 9:\n\nRow 9: . . T T T T A . . .  \nColumns 0-9: positions, (6,9) is 'A' apple at (6,9) in previous, but we ate that apple last turn.\n\nSo (6,9) is now empty after eating apple last turn.\n\nTherefore (6,9) is a valid move.\n\n- LEFT to (5,8): is this safe? (5,8) was a body piece previously. Actually, I need to check if (5,8) is occupied by my snake body or not.\n\n- The body after the last move was trailing at [(5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9)], possibly moved back one step after moving down.\n\nAnyway, due to snake movement, (5,8) was the second last position of the snake. It's probably safe now.\n\nLet's assume it's safe.\n\n- RIGHT to (7,8): is this safe? On previous boards, (7,8) had 'T' at some point but maybe now free.\n\n- DOWN to (6,7): is this safe? Checking if (6,7) has apple or obstacle.\n\nLooking at apples:\n\n- (9,7), (9,8), (0,1), (3,7) left.\n\n(6,7) is empty space.\n\nNow let's analyze threats:\n\n- Going towards the right side apples (9,7) and (9,8) remains our main goal.\n\nFrom (6,8):\n\n- Moving RIGHT takes us closer to (9,8).  \n- Moving DOWN takes us closer to (9,7).  \n- Moving UP possibly backtracks.  \n- LEFT seems towards own body, less preferable.\n\nBut we must avoid going back into our own body or into threats.\n\nLast move was DOWN, going UP immediately can cause self-collision (going backward). So UP is invalid.\n\nLEFT: (5,8) - might be own body, risky.\n\nDOWN: (6,7) safe.\n\nRIGHT: (7,8) - checking if it's safe (no T, no body)\n\nFrom the board row 8 col 7 is '.'\n\nSo safe.\n\nSo two promising moves: RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nMoving RIGHT (7,8) is closer towards the apples at (9,7) and (9,8).\n\nTherefore, I will choose RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy next turns:** continue moving right/down to get the apples on the right side first, then circle back to (3,7) and (0,1) later.\n\n**Decided move: RIGHT**"

So moving LEFT is actually allowed.\n\n---\n\n**Nearby cells from head (7,8):**\n\n- UP (7,9): 'T' (threat), unsafe.\n- DOWN (7,7): occupied by my body? No, it's the first segment right behind head, so moving DOWN is effectively moving into my own neck (the square immediately behind the head), which is illegal in Snake games (no 180 turns), so DOWN is illegal.\n- LEFT (6,8): No snake body or threat here, safe to move here.\n- RIGHT (8,8): '.' open space, safe.\n\nSo actually, DOWN is illegal (would be 180 reverse into my body), UP unsafe (threat), LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n\n---\n\n**Apples left:** (9,7), (9,8), (0,1), (3,7).\n\n**Risks:**\n\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7), with body below it.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,8) places me next to enemy snake's head at (8,7).\n- Moving LEFT (6,8) moves me away from enemy snake.\n\n**Distance to apples from current head (7,8):**\n\n- (9,7): down 1, right 2 \u2192 distance 3\n- (9,8): right 2 \u2192 distance 2\n- (0,1): far left-down\n- (3,7): left and down\n\nMoving RIGHT brings me closer to (9,8) and (9,7), good for points.\n\nMoving LEFT heads toward (3,7) and maybe eventually (0,1), further away and slower apple gain.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- LEFT move: safe, away from enemy, but farther from nearest apples.\n- RIGHT move: safe, closer to apples, but near enemy's head at (8,7).\n- DOWN and UP: illegal or unsafe.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake is at (8,7) with body below it, it might move DOWN or stay. Moving RIGHT to (8,8) might be risky but still manageable.\n\nI will accept the mild risk and move RIGHT to approach the closer apples.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\n- Continue pushing RIGHT toward (9,8) and (9,7) apples.\n- Stay alert for enemy snake moves.\n- If enemy tries to trap me, shift LEFT or DOWN accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**My decided next move: RIGHT**"
