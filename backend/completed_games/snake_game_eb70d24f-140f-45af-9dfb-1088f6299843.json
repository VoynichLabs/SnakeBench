However, (5, 6) is an empty space and doesn't lead to an apple, and the enemy snake is adjacent.\n  \n2. **DOWN to (4, 4)**: This is an empty square but does not lead to an apple either, plus it would lead me directly in line with the enemy snake\u2019s possible movements.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 5)**: This square is empty as well, and I would be moving away from the enemy and into open space.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 5)**: This position has an enemy snake at (5, 4) which I would be in line with and can potentially be dangerous as I would be bordering an enemy snake if they move down.\n\nConsidering my options, the safest move that does not put me in the line with the enemy snake is to go **LEFT to (3, 5)**.

No apple is located here, but the strategic position remains flexible. You can continue to make moves in subsequent turns toward the apples either on row 1 and column 2, or up towards row 9.\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 5)**:\n   - This would return you to your previous position, which isn't a valid backward move and risks running into yourself.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 6)**:\n   - This move is valid and leads to an empty square (2, 6). Although it doesn't put you closer to an apple than you already are, it allows for lateral movement.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 6)**:\n   - This move is valid and leads to another empty square (4, 6). It also opens columns 5, 6, and potentially leads upward through future moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best analysis favors moving **UP to (3, 7)**. It keeps the options open for future movements toward apples while avoiding danger from enemy snakes. Lastly, positioning upwards on the 7th row ensures that you can assert more control over your options without direct threats.\n\nNext turn strategy: Aim to position the snake centrally and continue navigating towards the upper apples without nearing the enemy snake. This will maximize your chances of collecting points while reducing risk.\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is: **UP**."

However, there are no apples directly above me on this column, and I will be further from the apples located at (2, 9) and (8, 9).\n   \n2. **DOWN to (2, 7)**:\n   - This square is empty, but it takes me further away from any potential apples. It does not seem advantageous.\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 8)**:\n   - This square is also empty. It takes me further away from my target apples at (1, 2) and (1, 3). This move doesn\u2019t have a strong strategic advantage immediately.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 8)**:\n   - This move returns me to my last position and closes off my options, as I do not want to revisit where I just came from.\n\n### Apple Positioning:\n- The apples at (1, 3) and (2, 9) are of particular interest to me. I want to keep moving towards a strategy that positions me to collect these apples potentially in the next move.\n\n### Strategic Analysis:\n- Moving UP to (2, 9) might not yield immediate benefits in terms of apples, but it could set me up for next moves.\n- I need to avoid the area where the enemy snake is to minimize risks.\n\n### Assessing Immediate Moves:\n1. **Continuing UP to (2, 9)** does not directly aid in getting apples but positions me defensively.\n2. **Going DOWN to (2, 7)** distances me from apples but keeps my options open for future moves.\n3. **LEFT to (1, 8)** only gets me further from my targets.\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 8)** is undesirable because it would place me backtracking.\n\nFor my next strategic step, I will choose to **move UP to (2, 9)**. This keeps me safe and gives some vertical space without immediately risking interactions with the enemy snake.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

Moving carefully is essential to get closer to these.\n\n### Strategic Analysis:\n- Moving DOWN to (2, 8) provides no future benefits and would create a backtrack.\n- LEFT to (1, 9) could open up future paths, potentially leading to (1, 3) or (1, 2) on subsequent turns.\n- RIGHT to (3, 9) also keeps options open, but may isolate my position amidst empty spaces.\n\nSince I cannot make a more advantageous move towards apples, my best option is to choose a path that keeps opportunities open.\n\n### Decided next move:\nI will choose to **move LEFT to (1, 9)**.

The immediate possible moves are:\n    - **UP to (1, 7)**: This is occupied by my body, so it\u2019s not a valid option.\n    - **DOWN to (1, 5)**: This square is empty, allowing further moves.\n    - **LEFT to (0, 6)**: This square is also empty, but doesn't lead toward any apples right now.\n    - **RIGHT to (2, 6)**: This square is empty as well.\n\n2. **Proximity to Apples**: \n    - The apple at **(1, 2)** is directly below my potential future moves, specifically (1, 5) and (1, 4), which puts me on a better trajectory to eat it. \n    - The apple at **(6, 2)** is also reachable further in the future with a series of downward and lateral maneuvers but it is farther from my current position.\n\n3. **Evaluating Strategy**:\n   - Moving **DOWN to (1, 5)** keeps me progressing directly toward (1, 2) and keeps my options open for future downwards and left movements.\n   - Moving **LEFT or RIGHT** doesn\u2019t progress me directly toward the apples and begins to veer away from my main goal.\n\n4. **Safety and Conflict**: There are no immediate dangers if I move DOWN to (1, 5) since I am not running into walls, myself, or an enemy snake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter evaluating the options available, the best move that progresses toward a near-term apple while maintaining flexibility in future turns is to **move DOWN to (1, 5)**. This keeps me on track for the apple at (1, 2) while ensuring I'm not boxed in.\n\n### Next Move\nI have decided: **DOWN**."

A safer approach is to clear this central column first by moving to the right, then swing north.\n- From (1,4) \u2192 RIGHT to (2,4), I avoid the enemy head and start my path toward (4,7).\n\nSo next move: RIGHT"
