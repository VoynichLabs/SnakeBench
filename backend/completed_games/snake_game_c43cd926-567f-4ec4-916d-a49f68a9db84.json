It has 0 length besides the head (body: none).\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2, 1).\n\nApples are at: (4, 9), (3, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5), (8, 6).\n\nMy possible moves and resulting head positions:\n1. UP: (7, 1)\n2. DOWN: (7, -1) - **Illegal (Off board)**\n3. LEFT: (6, 0)\n4. RIGHT: (8, 0)\n\nSafety Check (Self-Collision):\nSince my snake only has length 1 (just the head), self-collision (including moving backward) is only possible if the new position is occupied by my body. As I have no body segments, this is not a concern for any legal move. The move backward from (7, 0) would be to (7, -1), which is already ruled out as off-board.\n\nSafety Check (Enemy Collision):\nEnemy head is at $E_1 = (2, 1)$.\nIf I move to a new position $H'$, I must check if $H'$ is equal to $E_1$, or if $E_1$ moves to $H'$ in the same turn (head-on collision). Since we move simultaneously, this is a mutual check.\n\nWe need to determine the enemy's potential moves. Snake #1 at (2, 1) has possible moves:\n1. UP: (2, 2)\n2. DOWN: (2, 0)\n3. LEFT: (1, 1)\n4. RIGHT: (3, 1)\n\nLet's evaluate my potential moves:\n\n**Move 1: UP to (7, 1)**\n*   Safe from collision with $E_1$: (7, 1) is not any of $E_1$'s potential new positions: (2, 2), (2, 0), (1, 1), (3, 1).\n*   It is also not $E_1$'s current position (2, 1).\n*   Resulting state after move: My head at (7, 1). $E_1$ moves to one of its 4 safe spots.\n\n**Move 2: DOWN to (7, -1)** - **Illegal (Off board)**\n\n**Move 3: LEFT to (6, 0)**\n*   Safe from collision with $E_1$: (6, 0) is not any of $E_1$'s potential new positions.\n*   Resulting state after move: My head at (6, 0).\n\n**Move 4: RIGHT to (8, 0)**\n*   Safe from collision with $E_1$: (8, 0) is not any of $E_1$'s potential new positions.\n*   Resulting state after move: My head at (8, 0).\n\nAll three directional moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe from immediate death based on my current position and the opponent's known position/possible moves.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nMy goal is to reach the closest apples efficiently.\nCurrent apples: A = {(4, 9), (3, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5), (8, 6)}.\n\nDistances (Manhattan distance) from my current position (7, 0):\n*   To (8, 6): $1 + 6 = 7$\n*   To (4, 9): $3 + 9 = 12$\n*   To (3, 5): $4 + 5 = 9$\n*   To (1, 6): $6 + 6 = 12$\n*   To (1, 5): $6 + 5 = 11$\n\nThe closest apple is (8, 6), distance 7. If I move towards it, I should try to move RIGHT or UP.\n\nEvaluating the remaining safe moves:\n1. **UP to (7, 1):** Moves me closer to moving vertically toward the high Y apples, but I'm moving away from the nearest apple (8, 6) in terms of X coordinate change. Distance to (8, 6) remains 7 (now $1 + 5 = 6$ in terms of Y change needed). It places me adjacent to the enemy if they move RIGHT to (3, 1) or UP to (2, 2) if they decide to go towards the center/right.\n2. **LEFT to (6, 0):** Moves me further away from (8, 6).\n3. **RIGHT to (8, 0):** Moves directly towards (8, 6). Distance reduces to 6. This seems like a good greedy move towards the nearest objective.\n\nLet's see where the enemy snake #1 might go. They are close to apples (1, 6) and (1, 5). They might try to move LEFT/UP towards those.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (8, 0)**:\nI am now positioned to move UP (8, 1) next turn, lining up to attack (8, 6). This feels like the best initial move for accessing the closest apple. If the enemy is focused on the left side, this keeps me clear for now.\n\nIf I move **UP to (7, 1)**:\nI set up for (7, 2) next, which takes me further away from (8, 6) horizontally.\n\nGiven the objective is to collect apples, and (8, 6) is the closest, moving right towards it via (8, 0) is the most direct path while remaining perfectly safe.\n\nLong-term plan: Focus on the closest accessible apples first, balancing proximity with avoiding the enemy. Since the enemy is currently far away from (8, 0) and seems focused on the left side of the board, prioritizing the closest apple at (8, 6) by moving RIGHT is sensible.\n\nMy planned trajectory towards (8, 6) starting from (7, 0): (7, 0) -> (8, 0) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 2) -> ...\n\nI choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples=0.\nMove UP (8, 4) -> (8, 5). (8, 5) is NOT an apple.\nIn Snake rules, if you *don't* eat an apple, your tail moves one step forward (i.e., the cell previously occupied by the tail is vacated). If you *do* eat an apple, the tail stays put (growth).\nSince the move UP to (8, 5) was not landing on an apple, the snake should have shrunk by one segment *if the previous state description was accurate about body length*.\n\nLet's look at the actual provided state *after* Turn 6 move:\nTurn 6 Board state description (End of Turn 6, Start of Turn 7 calculation):\nYour snake (ID: 0): Head: (8, 5), Body: (8, 4), (8, 3), Apples collected: 0.\nThis implies the snake *grew* (or the body list provided in the turn description is the result of the move *leading into* this turn).\n\nIf the board state provided for Turn 7 is the *result* of your move UP from Turn 6:\nStart Turn 6 Head=(8, 4). Move UP to (8, 5). If no apple was eaten, the new tail becomes the old position of the head's predecessor. Since the tail position wasn't explicitly given in the previous turn's *Start* state, we look at the provided *End* state for Turn 6.\n\nPrevious Turn 6 State (Prediction used):\nHead: (8, 4), Body: (8, 3). (Length 2)\nApple at (8, 6).\nMove UP to (8, 5). This move did NOT eat an apple.\nIf no apple is eaten, length must be maintained by moving the tail.\nIf we assume the tail was at an unknown position $T_0$. New Head $H_1 = (8, 5)$. New Body $B_1 = \\{(8, 4)\\}$. New Tail $T_1 = T_0$ (if the snake was length 2, $T_0$ was (8, 3)).\nIf length 2: Head (8, 4) -> Body (8, 3). Move UP to (8, 5). New body should be (8, 4). If the snake moves normally without eating, the list should shrink from the tail end.\nIf H=(8, 4), B=(8, 3). Tail is (8, 3). New H=(8, 5). New B=(8, 4). Tail (8, 3) moves out of the body list. Snake remains length 2.\n\nHowever, the state provided for Turn 7 calculation explicitly states:\nYour snake (ID: 0): Head: (8, 5), Body: (8, 4), (8, 3), Apples collected: 0. (Length 3)\nThis suggests the snake *grew* on Turn 6, which means the move UP landed on an apple! But the apple list at the beginning of Turn 6 showed (8, 6) reachable, not (8, 5).\n\n**Crucial Assumption:** I MUST rely on the provided state data for the current turn (Turn 7). If the snake has body segments (8, 4) and (8, 3) AND the head is at (8, 5), then the snake has length 3. This means an apple *was* eaten on Turn 6 at position (8, 5), or the board state description is based on an unknown previous move consequence.\n\nGiven: H=(8, 5), B={(8, 4), (8, 3)}. Apples=0.\n\nEnemy $E_1$ moved from (1, 3) to (1, 4). $B_1 = \\{(1, 3), (1, 2)\\}$. (Length 3). This implies Enemy ate an apple at (1, 4) on Turn 6 OR the body list is just slightly longer/shorter than expected based on previous movement. Assuming the provided state for $E_1$ is correct.\n\nTarget apple: (8, 6). Distance 1 (UP).\n\nMy possible moves from (8, 5): (Board: 10x10, 0-9)\n1. **UP to (8, 6)**: Lands on the target apple!\n   - Safe Check: (8, 6) is not in my body $B=\\{(8, 4), (8, 3)\\}$.\n   - Safe Check: Enemy head $E_1$ is at (1, 4). Collision impossible.\n   - Outcome: Eat apple at (8, 6). Length increases. Score +1. New position (8, 6).\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 4)**: Hits own body segment $B_1$. **Self-kill.** Eliminate.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 5)**: Safe. Moves away from the apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 5)**: Safe. Moves away from the apple.\n\n**Strategy:** The move UP leads directly to collecting the closest apple (8, 6) and is perfectly safe. This is the highest priority move.\n\nLong-term plan: Secure this apple, then re-evaluate targets. The other apples are (4, 9), (3, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5). The enemy is closer to the left-side apples.\n\nDecision: UP.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

(Wait, Snake 1 moved UP to (4, 2) on Turn 7? Let's recalculate $E_1$'s move based on the board state provided during Turn 7 rationale selection.)\n\n**Revisiting Snake #1 Movement (Turn 7 Rationale State):**\nTurn 7 Rationale State: $E_1$ Head was (1, 4), Body was {(1, 3), (1, 2)}.\nApples near $E_1$: (1, 6), (1, 5), (3, 5).\n$E_1$ likely moved towards the cluster of apples near it. If it moved UP: (1, 4) -> (1, 5) (Eats apple). If it ate, its length grew.\nIf $E_1$ moved UP to (1, 5) on Turn 7: New Head (1, 5), New Body {(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)}.\n\n**Board State analysis for Turn 8:**\nThe current board state provided at the top of Turn 8 calculation MUST be the result of the previous move (UP).\n\nCurrent State provided:\nYour snake (ID: 0): Head: (8, 6), Body: [(8, 5)], Apples collected: 1. (Wait, this contradicts my expectation of growth on Turn 7).\n\n**CRITICAL DISCREPANCY CHECK:**\nThe state provided at the *start* of Turn 7 calculation showed: H=(8, 5), B={(8, 4), (8, 3)}, Apples=0. (Length 3).\nIf UP was chosen at Turn 7, and (8, 6) was empty, the snake should have moved to (8, 6) and the tail at (8, 3) should have been removed. New state: H=(8, 6), B={(8, 5), (8, 4)}. Apples=0.\n\nIf, however, the move chosen UP *did* result in eating the apple at (8, 6) (as I reasoned, which means the apple list provided *before* my move was wrong, or the state provided before my move was wrong), then:\nNew state should be: H=(8, 6), B={(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3)}. Apples=1 (Error still exists in the provided score tracking/apple count).\n\nLet's strictly adhere to the state provided *at the top of this Turn 8 analysis*, even if it implies my Move UP from Turn 7 was not an eating move, or the state transition from Turn 6/7 was unusual:\n\n**State at Start of Turn 8:**\nYour snake (ID 0): H=(8, 6), B=[(8, 5)]. (Length 2). Apples: 1.\nEnemy Snake #1: H=(4, 2), B=none. Apples: 0. (Length 1).\nApples: (4, 9), (3, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5), (4, 7).\n\nIf H=(8, 6) and B=[(8, 5)], this implies the move on Turn 7 was UP from (8, 5), and since the score only incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2 total collected by end of turn, though the score tracking shows 1/150), and length only increased by 1 segment compared to state described in Turn 7 *beginning rationale* (L=3) we must resolve the length.\n\n*Assumption based on Board State Picture and Current Tracking:*\nThe provided board visualization for Turn 7 was: H=(8, 5), B={(8, 4), (8, 3)}. Score 0 (at start of T7 selection). Move UP chosen.\nThe provided tracking for Turn 8 START states: H=(8, 6), B=[(8, 5)]. Score 1 collected.\n\nIf H=(8, 5) -> (8, 6) (UP) on Turn 7:\n1. If NO apple eaten: Tail (8, 3) is removed. New H=(8, 6), B={(8, 5), (8, 4)}. Score 0.\n2. If APPLE eaten at (8, 6): Tail (8, 3) persists. New H=(8, 6), B={(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3)}. Score 1.\n\nThe current state H=(8, 6), B=[(8, 5)] implies the snake shrunk despite eating an apple OR that I misread the snake length in the initial state description and that the UP move was NOT an eating move, but the score tracking is confusing.\n\n**I MUST prioritize the provided current state: H=(8, 6), B=[(8, 5)]. Length 2. Score 1 eaten total (meaning 2 currently held).**\nIf the snake is length 2 (H, B1), and the previous move was UP into (8, 6), and the cell (8, 6) contained an apple, the snake MUST have grown to length 3 ($H, B1, B2$). Since it is length 2, (8, 6) was NOT an apple for me, OR the score tracking/body representation is faulty.\n\nGiven the conflict, I will assume the configuration H=(8, 6), B=[(8, 5)] is the current truth, and the move UP from (8, 5) resulted in this configuration, meaning the tail vacated (8, 4) AND (8, 3) vacated, OR the snake was length 1 before (8, 5)->(8, 6) move. Let's stick to the explicit coordinates given: H=(8, 6), B=[(8, 5)].\n\nEnemy $E_1$: H=(4, 2). Body=None. (This enemy state also differs significantly from the prediction I made about its movement based on T7 rationale).\n\nCurrent Target: The nearest apples are (4, 7) and (4, 9) which are directly above the enemy's current position, and (3, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5) which are further left.\n\nMy Head is at (8, 6).\nMy Tail is at (8, 5).\n\nPossible moves from (8, 6):\n1. **UP to (8, 7)**: Safe. Moves towards (4, 9) and (4, 7) eventually, but slowly.\n2. **DOWN to (8, 5)**: Hits own body segment. **Self-kill.** Eliminate.\n3. **LEFT to (7, 6)**: Safe. Moves towards the center of the board.\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 6)**: Safe. Moves towards the edge.\n\nSnake #1 is at (4, 2). It has plenty of space.\n\nSince my movement options are severely restricted by self-collision (DOWN is illegal), I must choose UP or LEFT/RIGHT. I should aim generally towards the remaining apples, which seem clustered around the left/center of the board (near X=1 to X=4). Moving LEFT (7, 6) seems slightly better positioned than UP (8, 7) for later navigation to the cluster.\n\nLet's check the distance to the nearest apple (4, 7).\nCurrent (8, 6).\nMove LEFT to (7, 6). Distance to (4, 7) now needs 3 LEFT moves and 1 UP move (4 moves total).\nMove UP to (8, 7). Distance to (4, 7) now needs 4 LEFT moves (4 moves total).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 6):\n$E_1$ at (4, 2) will likely move towards the apples near it: (3, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5). If $E_1$ moves UP, it reaches (4, 3). This seems safe for now.\n\nI will choose LEFT to begin heading towards the main cluster of remaining apples, while maintaining a safe path away from my tail.\n\nPotential Danger: If I keep moving left, I might run into $E_1$ if it moves quickly across the board towards X=8. But $E_1$ is currently at X=4 and needs 4 turns just to reach my current X coordinate (8) if moving only horizontally.\n\nStrategy: Head towards the central/left apple cluster (around X=3, 4). Avoid my tail.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

This contradicts standard rules unless the score tracking (1 apple total) implies I am carrying an undeclared apple.\n\nGiven the severe confusion regarding body length tracking based on input states, I MUST assume that whatever move I make will result in a standard game mechanic adjustment unless I hit a wall or self-kill.\n\n**Current Head Position (Based on T8 Decision): (7, 6)**\n**Current Tail Position (Inferred from Board Diagram, suggesting T8 move UPON (7,6)): (8, 5)**\n\nIf H=(7, 6) and B=[(8, 5)]:\nPossible moves from (7, 6):\n1. **UP to (7, 7)**: Safe.

Moving to (6, 6) or (7, 5) seems reasonable to approach this cluster without overcommitting to the edge. (6, 6) gets me closer to X=4 by distance 2. (7, 5) gets me closer to X=3 by distance 1 (Y-direction).\n\nLet's check threats from $E_1$ at (4, 2). If $E_1$ moves UP, it reaches (4, 3). If it moves RIGHT, it reaches (5, 2). If it moves towards the center cluster, UP/RIGHT is likely.\n\nIf I choose LEFT to (6, 6): I am targeting X=4 apples. This feels strategically sound as it puts me next to the X=5 line.\nIf I choose UP to (7, 7): This keeps me high, which is fine, but doesn't immediately target the lower apples (3, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6).\n\nI will continue moving left towards the main concentration of food, aiming for (6, 6).\n\nLong-term plan: Navigate toward the apple cluster around X=1 to X=4.

I will proceed using the most logical, non-growth state after moving LEFT from (8, 6):\nAssumed Current Body: $S_0 = \\{(7, 6), (8, 6)\\}$. Length 2. (Tail (8, 5) dropped, previous head (8, 6) became the new tail).\nApples: (4, 9), (3, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5), (4, 7)\nMy Head: (7, 6)\nEnemy Head $E_1$: (3, 1)\n\n**Safety Check for Moves from (7, 6):**\n\nMy Body space occupied: (7, 6), (8, 6).\nBackward move: RIGHT to (8, 6). This is my own body, so **RIGHT is deadly**. (If the tail really is (8, 5) as per the diagram, then RIGHT to (8, 6) is the previous head slot, which is safe unless E1 moves there). Given the body uncertainty, I must prioritize safety based on standard non-growth rules: Moving into the spot my previous head occupied is safe if I didn't eat. Moving into my own tail is fatal. Since the prior move $T_8$ generated $H_8=(8,6), B_8=[(8,5)]$ and I moved LEFT to $(7,6)$, my new body must be $H_9=(7,6), B_9=[(8,6)]$ (dropping the (8,5) tail).\nIf $B_9=[(8,6)]$, then moving RIGHT to (8, 6) leads to **collision with own body**.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the body based on the provided visualization mapping **IF** the move was LEFT from (8, 6):\nHead (7, 6)\nBody (8, 5)\nIf this is the state, length is 2. Tail is (8, 5). Previous head was (8, 6).\nMove LEFT (7, 6) -> (6, 6). Safe move. New body: H=(6, 6), B=[(7, 6)]. Tail (8, 5) drops.\nMove RIGHT (7, 6) -> (8, 6). (8, 6) was the T8 head. If the snake didn't grow, (8, 6) is safe empty space.\nMove UP (7, 6) -> (7, 7). Safe.\nMove DOWN (7, 6) -> (7, 5). Safe.\n\nLet's assume the board visualization provided conflicts with the last move rationale, and I must base my move on the coordinates CURRENTLY listed at the top:\n**Head: (6, 6), Body: [(7, 6)]**. Length 2. This means the T8 move was RIGHT from (6, 6) to (7, 6), and then that new head position (7, 6) was used as the tail segment in the visualization, which makes no sense.\n\n**I MUST rely EXCLUSIVELY on the explicit coordinate listing provided at the start of Turn 9:**\nMy snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (6, 6)\n  - Body: [(7, 6)]\n  - Apples collected: 1\nThis means my state *before* my T9 move is $S_0 = \\{(6, 6), (7, 6)\\}$. Tail is (7, 6).\n\nMy Last Move was LEFT. If H=(6, 6) and B=[(7, 6)], then the LAST move must have landed me at (6, 6).\nIf I was at $(6, 6)$, moving LEFT would take me to $(5, 6)$.\nIf the LAST move PICK was LEFT, and the resulting state is H=(6, 6), B=[(7, 6)], this is highly inconsistent. The only way to end at (6, 6) with B=[(7, 6)] is by moving RIGHT from (5, 6) and eating an apple at (6, 6), or moving DOWN from (6, 7) and eating, etc.\n\n**Conclusion on State:** The conflicting information on the \"Last Move\" selection rationale versus the \"Current Board State\" provided makes predicting the next move based on survival from the *previous* state impossible. I **must** proceed based on the explicitly defined state for Turn 9: $H=(6, 6), B=[(7, 6)]$.\n\n**Current State for T9 Move Selection:**\nHead (6, 6). Body/Tail (7, 6). Length 2.\nBackward move: LEFT to (5, 6). Safe move.\nSnake 1 Head $E_1$: (3, 1).\n\nApples: A = {(4, 9), (3, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5), (4, 7)}\n\n**Candidate Moves from (6, 6):**\n\n1. **UP to (6, 7)**: Safe. Moves towards the high apples (4, 7), (4, 9).\n2. **DOWN to (6, 5)**: Safe. Moves towards the lower apples (3, 5), (1, 5).\n3. **LEFT to (5, 6)**: Safe (Backwards, but not into tail). Moves towards X=4/X=3 apples.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 6)**: This is the cell currently occupied by my tail. Moving here results in **self-collision (death)**. **DO NOT MOVE RIGHT.**\n\n**Enemy Threat $E_1$ at (3, 1):**\n$E_1$ can move towards the center mass of apples or towards me.\nPossible moves for $E_1$: (3, 2), (4, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0).\n\nIf $E_1$ moves UP to (3, 2), it is progressing toward the lower apples (3, 5).\nIf I move UP to (6, 7), I head towards the higher apples.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5), I head towards the lower apples (3, 5).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 6), I head towards the middle apples (1, 6), (3, 5).\n\nThe cluster of apples is dense in the area X=1..4, Y=5..6. $(6, 6)$ is slightly outside this core.\n\nMoving DOWN to (6, 5) positions me well to intercept (3, 5) or (1, 5) in the next 1-2 moves, while remaining central and safe from $E_1$ at (3, 1).\n\nStrategy: Target the lower/middle apples first ((3, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)). Prioritize approaching them linearly.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (6, 5)**:\nNext turn, if I go LEFT to (5, 5), I'm very close to (3, 5). This looks proactive.\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (5, 6)**:\nNext turn, I could go DOWN to (5, 5), leading to the same general area but one turn slower to reach Y=5.\n\nDOWN seems slightly more direct toward the densest group of food near Y=5.\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue closing distance to apples (3, 5) and (1, 5). Maximize safety from $E_1$ by keeping distance while moving towards food sources. Avoid moving right into (7, 6).\n\nMove selected: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

The move to (4, 5) last turn placed us perfectly adjacent to the apple at (3, 5). The immediate goal is to eat that apple or move towards the (1, 5)/(1, 6) pair. Safety remains paramount, but Snake #1 is currently far away on the bottom edge.\n\n**Analysis of Current Position (4, 5):**\nPrevious position was (5, 5). The tail is now at (5, 5). The head is at (4, 5).\nValid moves from (4, 5):\n1. **UP to (4, 6)**\n2. **DOWN to (4, 4)**\n3. **LEFT to (3, 5)** (Targets Apple A3!)\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 5)** (Self-collision - hits previous head position, which is now the body segment (5, 5). **Deadly.** Wait, this is the segment immediately behind the current head. Yes, moving right hits the body segment at (5, 5). **Deadly.**)\n\n**Safety Check (Head: (4, 5), Body: [(5, 5)])**\n*   Right (5, 5): Hits body. **Killed.**\n*   Left (3, 5): Safe from self.\n*   Up (4, 6): Safe from self.\n*   Down (4, 4): Safe from self.\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (Snake #1 at (5, 0))**\nSnake #1 is likely to move UP towards (5, 1). This leaves it extremely far from the action. No self-inflicted danger or collision risk with the enemy in this turn.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (3, 5)**: This eats the apple!\n    New Head: (3, 5). New Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5)]. Score increases to 2. This is the optimal move as it collects immediate food and continues the excellent pathing.\n\n2.  **UP to (4, 6)**: Safe, moves towards (4, 7). Good, but slower progress towards the main group.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (4, 4)**: Safe, moves away from the concentration of apples in rows 5/6.\n\n**Decision:** Moving LEFT to (3, 5) secures an apple and maintains excellent positioning relative to the remaining food.\n\nMove: LEFT\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nCurrent State Analysis (Turn 14):\nHead: (3, 5). Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5)]. Length: 3. Apples: 3.\nLast move was LEFT, eating the apple at (3, 5).\n\nApples remaining: (4, 9), (1, 6), (1, 5), (4, 7), (0, 0).\nThe best remaining targets are the dense cluster: (1, 6), (1, 5). We are currently at X=3, Y=5.\n\nEnemy Snake #1 moved from (5, 0) to (4, 0) based on my prediction of UP leading to (5, 1) being unlikely for a 1-segment snake aiming nowhere specific, or perhaps it moved RIGHT to (5, 1). Wait, my previous rationale predicted UP to (5, 1). Let's re-check the board state based on the current location of Snake #1:\nSnake #1 Head: (4, 0). This means Snake #1 chose DOWN or RIGHT from (5, 0) or LEFT/UP from elsewhere, which contradicts a naive UP move prediction. Since it is a 1-segment snake, it can move freely. (4, 0) is a valid move from (5, 0) (LEFT) or (3, 0) (RIGHT) or (4, 1) (UP) or (4, -1) (DOWN, invalid). If Snake #1 was at (5, 0) last turn, it moved LEFT to (4, 0). This keeps it far from us.\n\nValid moves from (3, 5):\nBody: [(4, 5), (5, 5)]. Tail is (5, 5).\n1. **UP to (3, 6)**: Safe self. Moves towards (1, 6).\n2. **DOWN to (3, 4)**: Safe self. Moves away from row 5/6 cluster.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 5)**: Safe self. Moves closer to (1, 5) / (1, 6).\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 5)**: Hits body segment (4, 5). **Killed.**\n\nSafety Check (Head: (3, 5), Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5)])\n*   Right (4, 5): Hits body. **Killed.**\n*   Left (2, 5): Safe from self.\n*   Up (3, 6): Safe from self.\n*   Down (3, 4): Safe from self.\n\nEnemy Movement Prediction (Snake #1 at (4, 0)):\nIt is highly unlikely to reach us this turn. E.g., moving UP leads to (4, 1). Still safe.\n\nEvaluating Safe Moves:\n\n1.  **LEFT to (2, 5)**: This puts us adjacent to (1, 5) and (1, 6). If we move LEFT again next turn, we might hit (1, 5) or position ourselves for (1, 6). This seems like the most direct approach to the next cluster of food.\n\n2.  **UP to (3, 6)**: Moves towards (4, 7) or possibly sets up a path towards (1, 6). It is one step away from (2, 6) which is adjacent to (1, 6).\n\n3.  **DOWN to (3, 4)**: Retreating from the primary food zone. Not ideal.\n\nComparing LEFT (2, 5) and UP (3, 6):\nMoving LEFT to (2, 5) puts us directly on the Y=5 line where (1, 5) lies.\nMoving UP to (3, 6) puts us directly on the Y=6 line where (1, 6) lies, while being closer to the corner apple (4, 7).\n\nSince there are two apples on Y=5/6 close by ((1, 5) and (1, 6)), closing the gap to X=1 seems optimal. Moving LEFT to (2, 5) positions us perfectly to eat (1, 5) next turn if possible, or move UP/DOWN to target (1, 6) or (4, 7).\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2, 5):\nNext turn options from (2, 5):\n   - UP (2, 6): Next to (1, 6)\n   - LEFT (1, 5): Eats apple!\n   - RIGHT (3, 5): Safe (tail moved away to (4, 5))\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 6):\nNext turn options from (3, 6):\n   - LEFT (2, 6): Next to (1, 6)\n   - UP (3, 7): Near (4, 7)\n\nThe concentration at X=1 is stronger (two apples vs one at X=4). Going LEFT seems highly efficient to clear the X=1 apples quickly.\n\n**Decision:** Move LEFT to (2, 5).\n\nLong Term Plan: Focus on clearing apples at (1, 5) and (1, 6). We are currently well-positioned below them. The next move aims for (1, 5) or (1, 6). We must remain wary of the growing snake that is Snake #1, although it is currently non-threatening.\n\nLEFT",
