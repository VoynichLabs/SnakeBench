If it moves right (toward (3,2)), I should avoid moving into its path. If it moves up/down, I can exploit vertical space.\n3. **Expand Safely:** After eating (2,4), my snake will be [(2,4), (2,5)]. Next moves should avoid creating tight loops or dead-ends. Left/Up/Right from (2,4) are safe, but Down would loop into my own body (invalid).\n4. **Block Enemy Growth:** If Snake #0 moves toward apples at (1,2) or (5,2), I may need to intercept or force it into a corner.\n5. **Future Apple Targets:** After (2,4), prioritize (5,2) or (7,3) if reachable without risk.

Focus on securing mid-board apples first to build length and flexibility.\n   - If Snake #0 is moving toward (5,2), I may need to intercept or force it into a less optimal path (e.g., by moving into its potential growth area).\n\n5. **Future Apple Targets:**\n   - After securing (5,2) or (7,3), aim for (9,9) or (6,2).

Focus on securing mid-board apples first to build length and flexibility.\n   - If Snake #0 is moving toward (5,2), I may need to intercept or force it into a less optimal path (e.g., by moving into its potential growth area).\n\n5. **Future Apple Targets:**\n   - After securing (5,2) or (7,3), aim for (9,9) or (6,2). The apple at (4,6) is isolated but may be worth chasing if no immediate threats arise.\n\n---\n**Current Analysis:**\n- My snake: Head at (3,3), body [(3,4)]. Safe moves from (3,3):\n  - **UP**: (3,4) \u2192 **Invalid** (collides with my own body at (3,4)).\n  - **DOWN**: (3,2) \u2192 Valid (no collision, no apple).\n  - **LEFT**: (2,3) \u2192 Valid (no collision, no apple).\n  - **RIGHT**: (4,3) \u2192 Valid (no collision, no apple).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n1. **DOWN (3,2):**\n   - Moves toward Snake #0\u2019s head at (1,3). If Snake #0 moves **DOWN** to (1,2), it could collide with me at (3,2) in the future, but not immediately.\n   - No immediate apple, but positions me closer to (5,2) if Snake #0 doesn\u2019t block it.\n\n2. **LEFT (2,3):**\n   - Moves toward the left side of the board, away from Snake #0\u2019s current position (1,3).\n   - No immediate apple, but opens space toward (2,4) or (2,2). Avoids direct conflict with Snake #0.\n\n3. **RIGHT (4,3):**\n   - Moves toward the center-right, closer to (5,2) and (7,3) apples.\n   - No immediate apple, but better long-term positioning than LEFT or DOWN.\n   - Snake #0 is at (1,3). If it moves **RIGHT** to (2,3), it doesn\u2019t directly threaten (4,3), but could block future paths.\n\n**Best Move:**\n**RIGHT (4,3)** is the most strategic because:\n- It avoids immediate conflict with Snake #0\u2019s head at (1,3).\n- It positions me closer to the cluster of apples at (5,2) and (7,3), which are high-value targets.\n- It keeps my snake flexible for future turns, avoiding dead-ends while expanding toward the center.\n\n**Alternative Consideration:**\nIf Snake #0 moves **RIGHT** to (2,3), I could still move **RIGHT** to (4,3) and adjust my path to avoid (2,3) in future turns. Moving **LEFT** to (2,3) is safer but less efficient for apple collection.\n\n---\n**Final Move:**\nRIGHT",

If it moves **DOWN** to **(3,3)**, it could block **(4,3)** or **(5,3)**. If it moves **RIGHT** to **(4,4)**, it may target **(5,2)** (now empty) or **(6,2)** (just eaten).\n   - Snake #0 is length 2; if it grows, it may contest **(7,3)** or **(4,6)**. Monitor its path to avoid forced collisions.\n\n3. **Snake Growth and Expansion:**\n   - My snake is now length 3. Avoid loops; prioritize moves that expand outward (e.g., toward **(7,3)** or **(6,3)**).\n   - Snake #0\u2019s tail is at **(3,4)**. If it moves **UP** to **(3,5)**, it could create a path toward **(5,2)** or **(7,3)**. I should avoid moving into positions that would force it into a tight corner.\n\n4. **Board Control:**\n   - The cluster at **(6,2)** and **(7,3)** is contested. Secure **(7,3)** while avoiding Snake #0\u2019s potential movements.\n   - If Snake #0 moves toward **(6,3)**, I may need to intercept or force it into a less optimal path (e.g., by moving into its potential growth area).\n\n5. **Future Apple Targets:**\n   - After securing **(7,3)**, aim for **(4,6)** or **(8,2)**. The apple at **(1,1)** remains low priority.\n\n---\n**Current Analysis:**\n- My snake: Head at **(6,2)**, body [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3)].\n- Safe moves from **(6,2)**:\n  - **UP**: (6,3) \u2192 Valid (no collision, no apple).\n  - **DOWN**: (6,1) \u2192 Valid (no collision, no apple).\n  - **LEFT**: (5,2) \u2192 **Invalid** (collides with my own body at (5,2)).\n  - **RIGHT**: (7,2) \u2192 Valid (no collision, no apple).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n1. **UP (6,3):**\n   - Moves toward the apple at **(7,3)** (adjacent to target).\n   - No immediate apple, but better long-term positioning for future turns.\n   - Snake #0 is at **(3,4)**. If it moves **RIGHT** to **(4,4)**, it doesn\u2019t directly threaten **(6,3)**.\n\n2. **DOWN (6,1):**\n   - Moves toward the bottom, away from the apple cluster.\n   - No immediate apple, but opens space toward **(6,0)** or **(5,1)**.\n   - Avoids direct conflict with Snake #0\u2019s current position.\n\n3. **RIGHT (7,2):**\n   - Moves toward the center, closer to **(7,3)** but not directly toward an apple.\n   - No immediate apple, but could position me for future growth toward **(7,3)**.\n\n**Best Move:**\n**UP (6,3)** is the most strategic because:\n- It positions me closer to the apple at **(7,3)**, a high-value target.\n- It avoids immediate conflict with Snake #0\u2019s head at **(3,4)**.\n- It keeps future options open (e.g., moving **UP** to **(7,3)** next turn if Snake #0 doesn\u2019t interfere).\n\n**Alternative Consideration:**\nMoving **RIGHT (7,2)** is also viable but doesn\u2019t directly advance toward an apple.

Secure this to grow quickly.\n   - **Mid-Priority:** (7,5) is a pivot point to reach (8,2) or (7,6) next. Control (7,5) to block Snake #0\u2019s potential movements toward (7,6).\n   - **Low-Priority:** (1,1) and (1,3) remain distant; focus on mid-board control first.\n   - **Enemy Pressure:** Snake #0\u2019s head is at (6,7). If it moves **DOWN** to (6,6), it may threaten (7,6). If it moves **LEFT** to (5,6), it could contest (5,5). **Key cells:** (6,5) and (7,5) are critical to control.\n\n2. **Snake #0 Prediction:**\n   - Snake #0\u2019s body is at [(5,7), (4,7)]. It will likely move **DOWN** to (5,6) or **LEFT** to (5,7) (already occupied) or **UP** to (6,7) (already occupied). Most probable: **DOWN** to (5,6).\n   - If it moves **DOWN** to (5,6), it may then move toward (5,5) or (6,5). **Avoid letting it occupy (6,5) or (7,5).**\n\n3. **Snake Growth and Expansion:**\n   - My snake is now length 5 (head at (8,4), body [(7,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)]).\n   - **Goal:** After eating (8,2), expand toward (8,3) or (9,4) to avoid Snake #0\u2019s potential movements. If Snake #0 grows, it may contest (6,6) or (7,6). Force it into less optimal paths by controlling (6,5) or (7,5).\n\n4. **Board Control:**\n   - The apple at (8,2) is now reachable in one move (**DOWN** from (8,4)). Secure this to grow and avoid Snake #0\u2019s potential movements.\n   - If Snake #0 moves toward (6,6), I can intercept or force it into a less optimal path (e.g., by moving into (7,5) or (8,3)).\n\n5. **Future Apple Targets:**\n   - After securing (8,2), aim for (7,5) or (9,4). The apple at (1,1) remains low priority.\n   - If Snake #0 grows, it may block (7,5), so preemptively control (6,5) or (7,6).\n\n---\n**Current Analysis (After RIGHT to (8,4)):**\n- My snake: Head at (8,4), body [(7,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)].\n- Safe moves from (8,4):\n  - **UP**: (8,5) \u2192 Valid (no collision, no apple).\n  - **DOWN**: (8,3) \u2192 Valid (no collision, no apple).\n  - **LEFT**: (7,4) \u2192 **Invalid** (directly behind head).\n  - **RIGHT**: (9,4) \u2192 Valid (no collision, no apple).\n  - **BACKWARD**: (8,3) \u2192 **Invalid** (directly behind head).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n1. **UP (8,5):**\n   - Moves toward (8,6) or (7,5), positioning for future apple collection.\n   - No immediate apple, but keeps options open for (7,5) or (8,6).\n   - Snake #0\u2019s head is at (6,7); if it moves **DOWN** to (6,6), it could threaten (7,6).\n\n2. **DOWN (8,3):**\n   - Directly leads to the apple at (8,2) next turn, growing my snake and increasing my score.\n   - Snake #0 is not in a position to block this move immediately.\n\n3. **RIGHT (9,4):**\n   - Moves toward (9,3) or (9,5). (9,3) is empty, and (9,5) is empty.\n   - Less direct toward high-value targets than **DOWN (8,3)**.\n\n**Best Move:**\n**DOWN (8,3)** is the most strategic because:\n- It positions me to eat the apple at (8,2) next turn, growing my snake and increasing my score.\n- Snake #0\u2019s head is not in a position to block this move.\n- After moving to (8,3), I can easily expand outward (e.g., **DOWN** to (8,2) to eat the apple, then **UP** to (8,3) or **RIGHT** to (9,3)) to avoid future conflicts.\n- This move aligns with the long-term goal of controlling mid-board apples while keeping Snake #0 at bay.\n\n**Alternative Consideration:**\nMoving **UP (8,5)** is neutral and doesn\u2019t advance toward high-value targets as quickly as **DOWN (8,3)**.\n\n---\n**Final Move:**\nDOWN",
