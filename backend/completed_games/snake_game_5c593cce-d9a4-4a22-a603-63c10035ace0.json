Body: empty. Length: 1.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head at (4, 0). Body: empty. Length: 1.\n*   **Apples:** (6, 2), (4, 6), (7, 0), (1, 2), (9, 7).\n\n**My Potential Moves (Head at (3, 1)):**\n\n1.  **UP (to (3, 2)):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Stays on board (0-9). Does not hit my body.\n    *   *Collision Check (Enemy 1 at (4, 0)):* Enemy moves simultaneously. If I go to (3, 2), the enemy must move to a cell adjacent to (4, 0) (or stay, but they must move). Potential enemy moves: (3, 0), (5, 0), (4, 1). None of these are (3, 2). This move is safe from collision, assuming the enemy doesn't move to (3, 2). Since the enemy has no body, I only worry about head-on collision at (3, 2). If Enemy 1 moves to (3, 2) from (4, 0), this is impossible in one step. **Safe.**\n    *   *Apple Proximity:* Moves closer to apples at (1, 2) and (4, 6) or (6, 2).\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 0)):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Stays on board. Does not hit my body.\n    *   *Collision Check (Enemy 1 at (4, 0)):* If I move to (3, 0) and Enemy 1 moves to (3, 0), we have a head-on collision. Enemy 1 can move to (3, 0) by moving LEFT from (4, 0). **RISKY / POTENTIALLY FATAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 1)):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Stays on board. Does not hit my body.\n    *   *Collision Check (Enemy 1 at (4, 0)):* Enemy 1 needs to move to (2, 1) to collide. Impossible from (4, 0) in one move. **Safe.**\n    *   *Apple Proximity:* Moves slightly away from the centralized cluster of apples.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 1)):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Stays on board. Does not hit my body.\n    *   *Collision Check (Enemy 1 at (4, 0)):* If I move to (4, 1) and Enemy 1 moves to (4, 1), we have a head-on collision. Enemy 1 can move to (4, 1) by moving UP from (4, 0). **RISKY / POTENTIALLY FATAL.**\n\n**Evaluating Risky Moves:**\nMoves DOWN and RIGHT both expose me to potential head-on collisions if Snake #1 chooses the corresponding direction (LEFT for DOWN, UP for RIGHT). Since the enemy strategy is unknown, avoiding moves that allow an immediate head-on collision based on the enemy's plausible moves is preferred.\n\n*   If I go DOWN to (3, 0), Snake 1 can go LEFT to (3, 0) $\\rightarrow$ Collision (Death).\n*   If I go RIGHT to (4, 1), Snake 1 can go UP to (4, 1) $\\rightarrow$ Collision (Death).\n\nTherefore, DOWN and RIGHT are immediately unsafe against the most direct responses from Snake #1.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP vs. LEFT):**\n\n*   **UP (3, 2):** Positions me well to potentially aim for (1, 2) or move towards the upper half of the board.\n*   **LEFT (2, 1):** Moves me further towards the left edge.\n\nUP seems strategically better as it keeps centralized options open and moves toward an existing apple (1, 2) while remaining safe from the immediate threat of the nearest enemy head which is currently below it.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:**\nFocus on safe traversal toward the closest apples, prioritizing moves that don't allow immediate head-on collisions with the adjacent enemy snake head (Snake #1 at (4, 0)). Since I am very small, avoiding collision is paramount. I will aim for the apple at (1, 2) next.\n\nMy chosen move is UP.\n\nUP",

None of these is (2, 2). **Safe.**\n    *   *Apple Proximity:* Moves towards (1, 2). Shortest path to (1, 2) remaining: needs one more LEFT move.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 2)):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Safe from edges/self.\n    *   *Collision Check (Enemy 1 at (4, 1)):* If Enemy 1 moves UP to (4, 2), we collide head-on. **RISKY.**\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP vs. LEFT):**\nBoth UP to (3, 3) and LEFT to (2, 2) are safe this turn as neither allows Snake #1 to immediately occupy the target square.\n\n*   **LEFT to (2, 2):** This brings me one step closer to the apple at (1, 2). If I move LEFT, the next move can likely be LEFT again to (1, 2) (if safe) or UP/DOWN. This establishes a path towards an apple.\n*   **UP to (3, 3):** This moves me away from the closest apple (1, 2) but keeps me centrally located in the Y direction. It also moves me closer to the apple at (4, 6).\n\nGiven the immediate proximity of the apple at (1, 2), prioritizing the path there seems advantageous, especially since I am small and collecting an apple early increases survival odds. Moving LEFT to (2, 2) directly sets up the next move towards that apple.\n\n**Future Planning (If moving LEFT to (2, 2)):**\nIf I move to (2, 2), Snake #1 moves from (4, 1) to one of (3, 1), (5, 1), (4, 0), or (4, 2).\nIf Snake #1 moves to (3, 1), I can then safely move LEFT to (1, 2) and eat the apple.\nIf Snake #1 moves to (4, 2), I can safely move LEFT to (1, 2) and eat the apple.\nIf Snake #1 moves to (5, 1) or (4, 0), I can safely move LEFT to (1, 2) and eat the apple.\nIt seems moving LEFT sets up a high probability of eating the apple at (1, 2) next turn, regardless of Snake #1's choice (as long as Snake #1 doesn't move somewhere to block the exit from (2, 2) or position for a collision on the subsequent move, which seems unlikely given their position).\n\nI choose LEFT to secure progress towards (1, 2).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Aim for apple (1, 2) this turn or next. After eating, reassess proximity to other apples (e.g., (6, 2) or (4, 6)). Maintain safety margins around Snake #1.\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nDecision process for this turn:\n1) Consider all four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (3, 2).\n2) Check safety against boundaries, self-body, and enemy head (Snake #1 at (4, 1)).\n\n*   **UP (to (3, 3))**: Safe. Progresses away from (1, 2).\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 1))**: Dangerous. Snake #1 can move LEFT to (3, 1) -> Collision.\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 2))**: Safe. Moves towards (1, 2). Likely sets up eating the apple next turn.\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 2))**: Dangerous. Snake #1 can move UP to (4, 2) -> Collision.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP vs. LEFT):**\nLEFT maintains the trajectory towards the nearest accessible apple at (1, 2), which was the reasoning for my last move. Since the move (LEFT) was deemed safe in the rationale, I should execute it despite the history showing I just moved LEFT (the system logs my previous move as UP, but my internal state update confirms I am now at (3, 2) because of the previous UP move). Wait, I must check my head position from the provided state.\n\n*Rethinking Turn/State Consistency:*\nTurn 1: Head (3, 1). Last move was UP. $\\rightarrow$ New Head (3, 2). **This matches the current board state.**\nTurn 2: Head (3, 2). Last move was UP. My rationale for Turn 2 was based on moving from (3, 2).\n\nMy choice for Turn 2 was LEFT, leading to (2, 2). I must now choose the move for Turn 3, based on the assumption the system will execute my Turn 2 choice (LEFT), resulting in a head at (2, 2) for Turn 3's decision cycle, *unless* the system execution of my previous move was overridden by an automated choice not displayed initially.\n\nGiven the strict instruction format: I must determine the move for the *current* turn based on the state provided *before* my last move's execution information.\n\n*Current State Analysis (Start of Turn 2 processing):*\nMy Head: (3, 2)\nEnemy Head: (4, 1)\nLast move executed (Turn 1): UP (Head went from (3, 1) to (3, 2)).\nMy rationale *for* Turn 2 was based on moving from (3, 2). I chose LEFT.\n\nSince I am being asked for the move now, I must generate the rationale for the move I should take *now* (Turn 3 based on the turn count, or Turn 2 if the previous move was executed but information about the new state is only implicitly provided). The prompt states: \"Turn: 2 / 150\". This means I am deciding my *second* move. My rationale above was my decision for Turn 2.\n\n**Crucial Step: Re-evaluating if the system executed the *last chosen move* (UP) or the move *I just selected* in the previous block (LEFT, which was in my \"START/END LAST MOVE PICK\" block).**\n\n1.  **Turn 1 Start:** Head at (3, 1). I selected UP.\n2.  **System Output for Turn 1:** `--Your last move information:-- UP **START LAST MOVE PICK** UP **END LAST MOVE PICK**`. This implies my selection for Turn 1 was UP.\n3.  **Board State Update:** Head is now (3, 2). (Consistent with UP move from (3, 1)).\n4.  **Turn 2 Start:** Board State & Enemy positions are shown. I am generating the rationale/move for Turn 2.\n\nTherefore, my detailed rationale above, where I analyzed moves from (3, 2), was actually my *Turn 2 Rationale*, and I concluded LEFT.\n\nIf I stick to the output format, I need to generate the rationale and final move *for this turn*. Since I already analyzed moves from (3, 2) and chose LEFT in the previous section, I must assume the system expects me to generate the rationale for the *next* move, which would be Turn 3, OR it expects me to confirm the move I just chose for Turn 2 within this final block structure.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will follow the explicit instructions: generate rationale and final single-word move based on the current board state presented at the top (Head at (3, 2), Enemy at (4, 1)). My analysis concluded LEFT was the best move for this state. I will use the clean analysis derived from that.\n\n**Current Head: (3, 2). Current Enemy Head: (4, 1).**\n\n1.  **UP (to (3, 3))**: Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 1))**: Collision risk if Enemy moves LEFT to (3, 1). Unsafe.\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 2))**: Safe. Progress towards (1, 2).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 2))**: Collision risk if Enemy moves UP to (4, 2). Unsafe.\n\n**Decision:** LEFT is the safest move that actively progresses toward the nearest target apple (1, 2).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Aim for apple (1, 2) this turn or next. After eating, reassess proximity to other apples (e.g., (6, 2) or (4, 6)). Maintain safety margins around Snake #1.\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

This is allowed; Snake 0 survives, Snake 1 dies.\n   *   If E chooses (4, 2): Safe.\n   *   *Conclusion for UP:* Generally safe, and potentially fatal to Snake 1 if it moves to (2, 2).\n\n**2.

(5, 1) is significantly closer (distance $\\sqrt{4^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{17}$). (6, 2) is distance 5. (5, 1) seems like the best immediate target.\n\nTo get to (5, 1) from (1, 2): Need 4 RIGHT moves, 1 DOWN move.\n\nMove Options Ranking based on progress towards (5, 1):\nRIGHT: Blocked by own body.\nLEFT: Moves away from target X=5.\nUP/DOWN: Moves perpendicular to X axis goal.\n\nSince the direct path RIGHT is blocked by the body segment at (2, 2), Snake 0 must first reposition itself to clear the path to the right, or move towards an apple in a different direction.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (1, 3), its tail might eventually move off (2, 2) allowing it to move through that spot later, but that takes time as the snake would need to grow first to lose the tail segment. Since we only have 1 length, the segment (2, 2) will be the tail next turn if we don't eat, and it will move one step towards (1, 2) if we choose UP/DOWN/LEFT.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (1, 1): Next turn, the tail (2, 2) moves to (1, 2) (becoming body). $B_0 = \\{(1, 2)\\}$. Head is at (1, 1). Now RIGHT to (2, 1) is safe, allowing progress towards X=5. This seems like the best setup move.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (1, 3): Next turn, the tail (2, 2) moves to (1, 2). $B_0 = \\{(1, 2)\\}$. Head is at (1, 3). Now RIGHT to (2, 3) is safe, allowing progress towards X=4, 5, 6...\n\nBoth UP and DOWN clear the path to the RIGHT in the next turn by advancing the existing body segment (2, 2) along the line of the current body. Since (5, 1) is slightly better aligned with DOWN movement (it requires a DOWN move eventually), choosing DOWN seems marginally better for overall path development towards the closest apple (5, 1).\n\nLet's choose **DOWN** to set up the escape path to the right.\n\nLong-term plan: Move DOWN/UP to clear the body segment at (2, 2) becoming the tail's path. Once (2, 2) is clear (i.e., the head reaches W=2 or W=3 and the body has moved), start moving aggressively RIGHT towards (5, 1) or (6, 2). Since we are safe either way, DOWN provides immediate proximity if the enemy chooses (3, 1) or (4, 2). If enemy chooses (2, 2), we survive and they die, which is excellent.\n\n**Chosen move: DOWN**\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

The next closest is $(6, 2)$ (Distance $\\sqrt{5^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.1$). If the previous move was DOWN to (1, 1) from (1, 2), the body segment (2, 2) from Turn 3 would now have moved to (1, 2) (becoming the tail). Let's verify the body state based on the assumed sequence (Turn 3: DOWN from (1, 2) -> (1, 1)).\n\n*If Turn 3 move was DOWN:*\nStart T3: $H=(1, 2), B=\\{(2, 2)\\}$. Move DOWN to (1, 1).\nEnd T3: $H_0'=(1, 1)$. $B_0' = \\{(1, 2)\\}$. (Since no apple eaten, old head (1, 2) becomes new tail segment).\nThe state provided for Turn 4 confirms: Head: (1, 1), Body: [(1, 2)]. This confirms the outcome of the previous (DOWN) move sequence was non-eating, and the body shifted correctly: Tail (2, 2) moved to (1, 2).\n\n**Safety Check (H0 at (1, 1), B0 = {(1, 2)}):**\n1.  **UP** to (1, 2): Hits own body segment $\\{(1, 2)\\}$. **Deadly.**\n2.  **DOWN** to (1, 0): Safe from self.\n3.  **LEFT** to (0, 1): Safe from self.

O survives.\n    *   If E chooses (3, 2), (3, 0), (4, 1): Safe.\n    *   *Conclusion for LEFT:* Safe, but moves away from target (5, 1). If E moves to (2, 1), E dies.\n\n3.  **If O chooses RIGHT (to (2, 1)):**\n    *   If E chooses (2, 1): **Head-on collision**. Both die.\n    *   If E chooses (3, 2), (3, 0), (4, 1): Safe.\n    *   *Conclusion for RIGHT:* High risk if E anticipates O's move towards (5, 1) and moves inwards toward (2, 1).\n\n**Target Acquisition Strategy:**\nThe target is (5, 1). Moving RIGHT to (2, 1) is the first step towards this target. Moving DOWN to (1, 0) moves away from X=5, although it brings us closer to the vertical alignment for (7,0).\n\nSince (5, 1) is the closest apple on the same Y-level, maximizing X progress seems prioritized now that the self-block at (2, 2) has been resolved (it moved to (1, 2), and we are blocked from (1, 2)).\n\nWe must avoid RIGHT if enemy is prone to moving toward the center line (2, 1). Since the opponent is small and likely navigating, occupying the center path (2, 1) poses a risk of mutual kill if they prioritize moving inward from (3, 1) to (2, 1) instead of continuing outward or backward.\n\nEnemy Snake 1's head is at (3, 1). The space immediately adjacent to H1 is (2, 1), (4, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2). If the opponent focuses on finding space or eating, (2, 1) is a reasonable central move. If we move RIGHT to (2, 1), we crash if the enemy moves LEFT to (2, 1).\n\nGiven the choice between a risky move towards the primary target RIGHT, and a safe move DOWN that moves away but keeps all future options open, safety usually prevails early on.\n\nIf we choose **LEFT** to (0, 1): We move away from the target (5, 1) but force the enemy to make a potentially suboptimal move if they attempt to block or move towards the center via (2, 1). If E moves to (2, 1), E dies because H1(3,1) -> (2,1) hits H0(1,1) -> (0,1)? No, H0 moves to (0, 1) and H1 moves to (2, 1). They are separate. If E moves to (2, 1), H1=(2, 1). Safe. **Wait, my analysis for LEFT collision was wrong on the consequence for E:**\nO chooses LEFT (to (0, 1)).\nIf E chooses (2, 1): E moves to (2, 1). H0=(0, 1). H1=(2, 1). This is safe for both. My previous note about E dying if E chooses (2, 1) was mistakenly based on H1 hitting B0. H1 at (3, 1) moving to (2, 1) does not hit B0={(1, 2)}.\n\nLet's re-evaluate safety based on minimizing risk AND maximizing progress toward the closest apple (5, 1).\n\nTarget (5, 1). Progress requires moving RIGHT.\nOption RIGHT (2, 1): Risky due to head crash if E moves LEFT to (2, 1).\nOption DOWN (1, 0): Safe, but moves away from X=5.\nOption LEFT (0, 1): Safe, but moves furthest away from X=5.\n\nSince we are only at Turn 4, establishing a safe rhythm is important. Moving RIGHT towards the apple exposes us most directly to the enemy head if they move toward us. The fact that the enemy board position (3, 1) is adjacent to our potential move (2, 1) makes RIGHT highly suspicious.\n\nLet's prioritize safety and try to align for the next safe RIGHT move. Moving DOWN to (1, 0) means that next turn, we could potentially move RIGHT to (2, 0). Since B0 is at (1, 2), moving DOWN keeps the body mass away from the general trajectory needed for the next few moves RIGHT (Y=1).\n\nIf we move DOWN: $H_0'=(1, 0), B_0'=\\{(1, 1)\\}$.\nEnemy possibilities: If E moves to (2, 1), H1=(2, 1). Safe.\nNext turn, we can safely move RIGHT to (2, 0). This is one step closer to the X=5 required for (5, 1).\n\nIf we move LEFT: $H_0'=(0, 1), B_0'=\\{(1, 2)\\}$.\nNext turn, we could move RIGHT to (1, 1). This lands exactly where we were before the move UP/DOWN sequence in T3, but now B0 is {(1, 2)}. This is safe.\n\nComparing DOWN vs LEFT: Both are safe and set up a RIGHT move next turn (either to (2, 0) or (1, 1)). Moving DOWN sets us up better for apple (7, 0) if (5, 1) proves too hard to reach quickly, and it's generally a more central alignment than moving to the edge (Y=0 is usually slightly safer than Y=9).\n\nI choose **DOWN** to maintain safety and prepare for subsequent RIGHT moves toward (5, 1).\n\nLong Term Plan: Move towards the closest apple (5, 1). Since we cannot move directly right due to potential collision risk with H1 moving towards us, we utilize a safe vertical move (DOWN in this case) to prepare for a direct rightward path next turn where H1 is less likely to intercept us. After moving to (1, 0), the immediate priority is moving RIGHT towards X=5.\n\nDOWN",

Snake length is 2. This confirms the transition.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 5):**\nH0 = (1, 0). B0 = {(1, 1)}.\nH1 = (3, 0). B1 = $\\emptyset$.\nTarget Apple: (5, 1) is closest overall distance $\\sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.12$. (7, 0) is distance $\\sqrt{6^2 + 0^2} = 6$. (6, 2) is $\\sqrt{5^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{29} \\approx 5.38$.\n\nWe should aim for (5, 1). This requires moving RIGHT, then potentially UP or RIGHT again.\n\n**Safety Check (H0 at (1, 0), B0 = {(1, 1)}):**\n1.  **UP** to (1, 1): Hits own body segment $\\{(1, 1)\\}$. **Deadly.**\n2.  **DOWN** to (1, -1): Off board. **Deadly.**\n3.  **LEFT** to (0, 0): Safe from self. (Boundary OK)\n4.  **RIGHT** to (2, 0): Safe from self.\n\nEliminated: UP, DOWN. Remaining safe moves (self): LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Potential Moves (H1 at (3, 0), B1 = $\\emptyset$):**\nEnemy can move to (3, 1), (3, -1) [Off, deadly], (2, 0), or (4, 0).\nSafe moves for E: (3, 1), (2, 0), (4, 0).\n\n**Collision Check (H0' vs H1' and B0):**\nB0 = {(1, 1)}.\n\n1.  **If O chooses RIGHT (to (2, 0)):** This is the best move towards (5, 1).\n    *   If E chooses (2, 0) [Moves LEFT]: **Head-on collision**. Both die.\n    *   If E chooses (3, 1): Safe. H0=(2, 0), H1=(3, 1).\n    *   If E chooses (4, 0): Safe. H0=(2, 0), H1=(4, 0).\n    *   *Risk Analysis:* Moving RIGHT puts us directly in contention with the enemy's potential move LEFT to (2, 0). Since the enemy is also low on the board, they might try to move outwards (4, 0) or stay central (3, 1). The risk of collision is significant if the enemy tries to approach us sideways or tries to move towards the center line.\n\n2.  **If O chooses LEFT (to (0, 0)):** This moves away from (5, 1) but is safe unless E moves to (0, 0) which is not possible from (3, 0).\n    *   If E chooses (2, 0): Safe. H0=(0, 0), H1=(2, 0).\n    *   If E chooses (3, 1): Safe.\n    *   If E chooses (4, 0): Safe.\n    *   *Risk Analysis:* This move is safe regarding immediate head clashes, but it sacrifices forward progress toward the closest apple (5, 1). Next turn, we could move RIGHT to (1, 0), but we were just there.\n\n**Strategy Re-evaluation:**\nWe must progress towards (5, 1). Moving RIGHT (2, 0) is the direct path. The risk is that H1 at (3, 0) can move to (2, 0) and cause a mutual kill. The enemy's options are (2, 0), (4, 0), (3, 1).\nIf we move RIGHT, we force the enemy to choose NOT to move LEFT. If they choose (4, 0) or (3, 1), we gain a significant advantage in X coordinate progression.\n\nGiven that the enemy is small (length 1), they might be focusing on finding open space or moving towards the lowest apple (7, 0) or just exploring. (7, 0) is only 4 steps away for them if they move exclusively RIGHT.\n\nIf we don't move RIGHT now, we waste potential momentum. Let's assess the probability of E choosing (2, 0). Since E is at (3, 0), choosing (2, 0) seems like a sideways movement to stay low, perhaps checking for exploration options near our current location.\n\nIf we choose LEFT (0, 0), our path to (5, 1) takes 5 moves RIGHT (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (5, 0 -> 5, 1).\nIf we move RIGHT (2, 0), path takes 4 moves (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (5, 0 -> 5, 1).\n\nIf we move RIGHT and survive, we gain a turn lead on the target. If we collide, we lose. In early game, aggression towards the nearest target is often justified if the collision risk is perceived as less than 50%. Since H1 is far from B1, they are not concerned about self-destruction yet, so they might move aggressively too.\n\nHowever, the proximity here is extreme: H0=(1, 0), H1=(3, 0). If H0 moves to (2, 0) and H1 moves to (2, 0), it's a mutual kill. This is a 1/3 risk multiplier on the step if we assume the enemy distributes moves equally among their 3 safe options.\n\nLet's check the alternative target (7, 0). If we move RIGHT to (2, 0), we are aligned nicely for the next move RIGHT to (3, 0), directly towards (7, 0). If we move LEFT to (0, 0), we are moving AWAY from (7, 0).\n\nSince (5, 1) is closer than (7, 0), aiming for (5, 1) is better. The path to (5, 1) requires moving RIGHT.\n\nIf we play conservatively with LEFT (0, 0), we are safe, but we lose positional advantage towards (5, 1). We will be at (0, 0), and the enemy might move to (4, 0) or (3, 1) and gain ground on (5, 1) by moving RIGHT next turn.\n\nIf we move RIGHT (2, 0), and the enemy moves to (4, 0), we can move RIGHT again to (3, 0) next turn, which is very effective progress.\n\nI will risk the collision for positional gain on the closest apple. I will choose **RIGHT**.\n\nLong Term Plan: Move rightwards towards apple (5, 1). If collision occurs, we die; otherwise, continue moving right to reach (5, 0) or (5, 1) as quickly as possible. If survival seems tenuous next turn due to enemy proximity, prioritize moving away from the center line (Y=0) perhaps via UP if safe, or stick to the line if the snake remains short and mobility high.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
