RIGHT: Moving to (1, 8)\n   - Safe: Within board boundaries\n   - Not into my own body\n   - Not into enemy body\n   - Not a backwards move\n   - This is an empty space\n\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (0, 7) and RIGHT to (1, 8).\n\nLet me consider which is better:\n- DOWN moves me away from the top edge and towards the apple at (0, 0)\n- RIGHT moves me towards the center of the board and potentially towards other apples\n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy snake's head is at (6, 9) and its body is along the bottom row. Since the enemy snake is at the bottom, moving down might be safer as it moves away from the enemy.\n\nLet me also consider the apple positions:\n- (9, 4) - far right, middle\n- (9, 9) - top right corner\n- (0, 0) - bottom left corner\n- (7, 9) - top right, near enemy head\n- (2, 3) - middle left\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 8) would position me in the middle of the board, giving me more flexibility to reach various apples. This move also keeps me away from the top edge where the enemy snake is located.\n\nI think RIGHT is the better move as it gives me more flexibility and moves me towards the center of the board where I have more options.<|begin_of_box|>RIGHT<|end_of_box|>",

I need to choose the best one.\n\nConsidering the apple positions and my current location, moving UP seems most strategic:\n- It directly approaches the apple at (3, 8)\n- It keeps me in open space away from the enemy snake\n- It maintains flexibility for future moves\n\nThe enemy snake is much longer (14 apples vs my 6) and is positioned on the right side of the board, so I should avoid getting trapped or cornered. Moving UP keeps me in the lower-middle area where I have more room to maneuver.\n\nI'll choose UP to move toward the apple at (3, 8) while maintaining a safe distance from both my own body and the enemy snake.<|end_of_box|>\n<|begin_of_box|>UP<|end_of_box|>",
