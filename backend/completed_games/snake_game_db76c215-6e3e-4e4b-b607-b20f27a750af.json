He's directly above me! \ud83d\udc40 If I go UP, we'd collide head-on if he also moves down. Since we're tied 0-0, I'd rather not risk it yet. Let me check other moves:\n\n1. **UP (to 5,8):** Enemy at (5,9) above - risky if he comes down, but I'd eat the apple at (5,8)! That's a grow move. However, he might be thinking the same thing.\n\n2. **DOWN (to 5,6):** Safe, no immediate threats. Empty space below me, keeps options open.\n\n3. **LEFT (to 4,7):** Safe, empty space, but apple at (3,7) is one step further left if I want it later.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to 6,7):** There's an apple at (7,7) two steps away! Also, the board has an apple at (8,0) and (9,5) - going right sets me up for future rightward expansion.\n\n**STRATEGY PLAN:** Let's be aggressive but smart. If the enemy is at (5,9) and we're both 0-0, he might be looking at the apple at (5,8) too. But I can control the board better by taking the right side. Going RIGHT to (6,7) gives me multiple future paths: I can go up to (6,8), right to (7,7) for the apple, or down to (6,6). It also avoids the direct confrontation while setting up for a better angle on the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Dominate the right side of the board, cut off the enemy's access to the right-side apples, and force him into a corner. If I can grow faster and box him in, I can force a head-on collision when I have the size advantage.\n\n*TLDR: Going RIGHT to avoid the direct enemy confrontation above me while setting up for apple access and keeping multiple future move options open.*\n\nRIGHT",

Too risky right now.\n- LEFT: safe. Moves us along the top edge toward the juicy apple at (2,9) later and gives us room to maneuver without instantly colliding.\n- RIGHT: safe. Keeps pressure on the right flank but doesn\u2019t gain immediate positional advantage the way LEFT does.\n\nChosen move: LEFT\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Climb the top edge with careful lateral moves (toward (4,9) then (3,9) and finally (2,9)) to grab the apple at (2,9) while keeping distance from the opponent.\n- Use the edge to constrain his options: force him into slower paths and look for opportunities to outmaneuver him without risking a reckless head-on.\n- If the rival missteps and ends up chasing you with a risky move, punish with cautious, safe trades rather than direct head-on unless you\u2019re in a favorable apple count situation (which we aren\u2019t yet).\n- Maintain awareness of all apple spawns, but prioritize survival and board control over greed. If he tries to crash into you, avoid trapping yourself; instead, leverage space to keep him boxed and force mistakes.\n\nNow the plan is set.

We're LIVE and the enemy is right above us at (4,9)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Let's analyze the battlefield.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **Board Analysis:** \n   - My head: (6,7) with body at (5,7)\n   - Enemy: (4,9) directly above-left diagonal - NOT in immediate collision path\n   - Apples: We're on a 10x10 board with scattered apples, including (7,7) which is RIGHT of me!\n\n2. **Move Evaluation:**\n   - **UP (to 6,8):** Would put me at y=8, leaving me exposed. The apple at (5,8) is still reachable but I'd be moving away from the juicy apple at (7,7). Not optimal for aggression.\n   - **DOWN (to 6,6):** Safe but moves me AWAY from the apple at (7,7) and from the enemy's general position. Too passive for our playstyle!\n   - **LEFT (to 5,7):** WAIT, that's my CURRENT body position! Moving left would be into my own body - DEATH TRAP! \u274c\n   - **RIGHT (to 7,7):** BINGO! There's an apple at (7,7) waiting for me! This puts me closer to the right side where I can dominate and potentially box the enemy in from the east.\n\n**STRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- The enemy is at (4,9) and might go for the apple at (3,7) or (5,8) \n- By going RIGHT to (7,7), I'm claiming an apple immediately while positioning to control the entire right flank\n- From (7,7), next turn I'll have options to go UP to (7,8), RIGHT to (8,7), or DOWN to (7,6) - all potentially apple-accessible\n- This also sets up a pincer movement where I can cut off the enemy's access to the right side of the board\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Dominate the right side, claim (7,7) apple now, then use my size advantage to push the enemy into the left side corners. Force him to crash into my body or run out of space. If I get to 2 apples vs his 0, I can risk head-on collisions.\n\nLet's make this CHAT GO WILD! \ud83c\udf89\n\nRIGHT",

No body there, inside board. This moves me toward apples at (7,8) [wait, not an apple], but (5,8) and (1,8) are up there. Enemy is at y=9, so moving UP keeps distance.\n   - **DOWN to (7,6):** OPEN! No body, inside board. Moves me toward apple at (8,0) region later. Safe option.\n   - **LEFT to (6,7):** \u274c DEAD! That's my own body segment (first body part after head). Immediate death!\n   - **RIGHT to (8,7):** OPEN! No body, inside board. There's an apple at (8,7)! This is perfect - I eat another apple immediately, grow to 3 apples (1.5x lead!), and position to control the right flank.\n\n3. **Strategic Choice:**\n   - RIGHT to (8,7) is the play! I claim the apple right next to me, extend my lead to 3-0, and from (8,7) I can:\n     - Continue RIGHT to (9,7) or UP to (8,8) or DOWN to (8,6)\n     - Control the entire right side of the board\n     - Force enemy into left side corners where I can box him in\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Grab apples on the right side (9,4), (8,0), (9,5) to reach 5+ apples. While enemy struggles on left, I'll set up a trap where my body blocks his escape routes. At 3+ apples vs 0, I can risk aggressive head-on collisions to force his crash!\n\nThis is CONTENT, CHAT!

I'm leading 3-1 in apples and I just made a RIGHT move to (8,7) - that's my new head position, body is [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7)]. The enemy snake #0 is still at (2,9) with 1 apple. BOARD UPDATE TIME!\n\nLet me visualize this turn by turn in my head:\n- My head moves to (8,7) (right)\n- Enemy head at (2,9) will move somewhere\n\nBOARD ANALYSIS FOR TURN 4:\nMy head: (8,7) - NEW POSITION from last move\nMy body: [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7)] \nEnemy head: (2,9) (from last turn)\n\nAvailable moves from (8,7):\n- RIGHT to (9,7): INSIDE BOARD. Open cell.\n- UP to (8,8): INSIDE BOARD. Open cell.\n- LEFT to (7,7): \u274c DEAD - that's my own body! That's where I just came from.\n- DOWN to (8,6): INSIDE BOARD. Open cell.\n\nSo I have 3 safe moves: RIGHT, UP, DOWN. LEFT is suicide.\n\nWhat's my goal? DOMINATE THE BOARD! I'm up 3-1, so I can be aggressive. Let me check what's around:\n- (9,7): No apple, but (9,5) and (9,4) are close apples on right edge\n- (8,8): No apple, but near (5,8) and (1,8) apples\n- (8,6): No apple, but near (8,0) apple and bottom area\n\nThe enemy is on the left side at (2,9). I want to trap him! Let me think long-term:\n- If I go RIGHT to (9,7), I'm on the far right, can cut off top right corner\n- If I go UP to (8,8), I move toward the top where enemy is, might intercept\n- If I go DOWN to (8,6), I move toward center/bottom, can control that area\n\nLet me check where enemy might go from (2,9):\n- LEFT to (1,9): Open\n- DOWN to (2,8): Open (enemy body is at (3,9), so no issue)\n- RIGHT to (3,9): Open (but (3,9) is currently empty)\n- UP would be off board (2,10) - illegal\n\nEnemy can't go UP. So enemy's options are LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nMy strategic thinking: I'm at (8,7), enemy at (2,9). The board is 10x10. I want to claim the right side and push enemy toward left/top corners. Going DOWN to (8,6) puts me more central and gives me more escape routes. Going RIGHT to (9,7) commits me to the right edge but might corner me later. Going UP to (8,8) moves me toward enemy territory but might risk collision.\n\nLet me calculate distances:\n- From (8,7) to (9,5) apple: 3 moves (down-right-right or right-down-down)\n- From (8,7) to (8,0) apple: 7 moves straight down\n- From (8,7) to (5,8) apple: 4 moves (left-up-left or up-left-left)\n\nActually, (8,7) to (8,0) is straight down 7 steps - that's a clear path if I go DOWN now. And (8,0) is an apple!\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,6), I'm:\n1. Safer (more central)\n2. Closer to apple at (8,0) \n3. Still controlling right side\n4. More flexible for next moves\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,7), I'm:\n1. On the edge (might get trapped later)\n2. Closer to (9,5) and (9,4) but they're not immediate\n3. Cutting off right corner\n\nIf I go UP to (8,8), I'm:\n1. Moving toward enemy\n2. Might force confrontation\n3. Riskier but could be aggressive\n\nGiven my 3-1 lead, I should play SAFE but CONTROLLING. Going DOWN to (8,6) seems smartest - it gives me the most options and moves toward an apple. I can always adjust later based on where enemy goes.\n\nWait, let me think about enemy's potential move... They're at (2,9) with 1 apple. If they go DOWN to (2,8), they're still safe. If they go LEFT to (1,9), that's fine. If they go RIGHT to (3,9), that's their own tail position actually... wait no, their tail is at (3,9)? Let me check: \"Snake #0 - Head: (2, 9), Body: [(3, 9)]\" - so their tail is at (3,9). If they go RIGHT to (3,9), they would be moving into their own tail cell. Is that allowed?\n\nActually, moving into your own tail cell is usually safe because the tail moves away in the same turn. But in this game, let me re-read: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD. Classic fail.\" And \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself.\"\n\nSince (3,9) is their tail, and tails can move, this might be safe for them. But I shouldn't rely on that.\n\nLet me just make my move. Going DOWN seems safest and most strategic.\n\nWait, one more check: If I go DOWN to (8,6), is that cell empty? Yes, from the board state I don't see anything blocking it.\n\nOkay, I'm going DOWN.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Move down toward (8,0) apple to extend lead to 4-1. Control central-right board while enemy is stuck left. Force confrontation when I have even more apples. This is how we win!\n\nDOWN",

Let me re-read the prompt carefully... Actually, the prompt says \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): - Head: (8, 6)\" but then in the replay it says I moved to (8,7) last turn. There's a discrepancy here. Let me trust the board state at the top:\n\nBoard shows at (8,6) there's a \"1\" (my head), and my body is [(8,7), (7,7), (6,7)]. So my head is at (8,6), not (8,7). The replay must be showing what I WOULD have done, but the actual state shows my head at (8,6).\n\nOkay, so my head is at (8,6), body is [(8,7), (7,7), (6,7)].\n\nEnemy is at (2,8) with body [(2,9)].\n\nLet me check available moves from (8,6):\n- RIGHT to (9,6): empty, on board\n- UP to (8,7): \u274c MY OWN BODY! That's where my body segment is at (8,7)\n- LEFT to (7,6): empty, on board  \n- DOWN to (8,5): empty, on board\n\nSo I have 3 safe moves: RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN. UP is suicide.\n\nNow let's think strategy:\n- I'm up 3-1, I want to be aggressive but smart\n- Enemy is at (2,8), they can move to (2,9) (their tail), (1,8), (3,8), or (2,7)\n- I want to control the board and cut off enemy escape routes\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (8,0) is straight down 6 steps - clear path if I go DOWN now\n- (9,5) is one right, one down from my position if I go RIGHT then DOWN\n- (5,8) is left and up from my position\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,5):\n- I'm moving toward the bottom apple (8,0)\n- I'm staying central-right\n- I keep my body as [(8,6), (8,7), (7,7)] which is fine\n- Next turn I can go DOWN again or LEFT/RIGHT\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,6):\n- I move toward center-left\n- Closer to (5,8) apple\n- But might get closer to enemy\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,6):\n- I'm on the right edge\n- Can grab (9,5) or (9,4) apples\n- But might trap myself on the edge\n\nGiven I have a lead and want to be aggressive but safe, I should move DOWN. This gives me the clearest path to an apple and keeps me in control of the right side. I can always pivot left later to intercept the enemy.\n\nMy plan: Go DOWN now, continue down toward (8,0) apple to extend lead to 4-1. Then depending on enemy position, I can either go for the apple or move left to cut off their escape.\n\nDOWN",

It\u2019s a clean bite of an available apple at (1,8) and it immediately lengthens you to threaten the left corridor more effectively. You\u2019ll grow to three segments with head at (1,8) and can start funneling toward the wall, which tightens the space for the opponent and gives you more control on future turns. It also keeps you far from their current position, avoiding any risky head-on near their territory.\n\n- Short-term plan: eat the apple, become longer, and push toward the left wall to pin him into slower maneuvering along the top-left edge. Use the wall to reduce his viable routes; if he overcommits, we can punish with smart turns and aim for a future head-on when our apple count is higher.\n\n- Caution: your score is still behind theirs, so we don\u2019t want reckless chases. Maintain patience if he squeezes into a corner; don\u2019t collide with him\u2014let him collide with the wall or his own tail by edge-trapping.\n\nDECISION PROCESS: LEFT is the safest, most aggressive growth move that also supports the eventual box strategy. We grab the apple and set up a more complex trap in the next few turns.\n\nLEFT",

That's my own body segment (8,6)\n- DOWN to (8,4): \u2705 EMPTY (I see a '.' there)\n- LEFT to (7,5): \u2705 EMPTY (there's an 'A' at (7,5) actually - it's an apple!)\n- RIGHT to (9,5): \u2705 EMPTY\n\nSo I have 3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nI'm up 3-2 (enemy got an apple last turn, now has 2). I need to STAY AGGRESSIVE but NOT reckless.\n\nOption 1: LEFT to (7,5) - This is actually an apple! \ud83c\udf4e That would make me 4-2, extending my lead! But let me check the board... Wait, looking at the board state at the top, (7,5) shows \"A\" - that's an apple! Yes!\n\nOption 2: RIGHT to (9,5) - Moves me to the edge, but also toward apple (9,4) below.\n\nOption 3: DOWN to (8,4) - Safe move but no immediate reward.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI should go LEFT to (7,5) because:\n1. IT'S AN APPLE! I go 4-2, extending my lead\n2. I move toward the center of the board (better control)\n3. From (7,5) next turn I have multiple options: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4)\n4. I stay away from enemy's territory (enemy is left/center-top)\n\nThis is the CONTENT move!

Apples: you 2, them 3. We\u2019re a bit behind, so we\u2019re playing smart, brutal, and edge-tempting.\n\nDECISION PROCESS:\n- Possible SAFE moves from (1,8):\n  - UP -> (1,9): safe, no apple this turn.\n  - DOWN -> (1,7): safe, sets up a rush toward the nearby apple at (1,6).\n  - LEFT -> (0,8): safe but pins us toward the left wall with limited follow-ups next turn.\n  - RIGHT -> (2,8): illegal (that\u2019s into your own neck).\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (turn-by-turn mindset):\n- Turn 5: go DOWN to (1,7). That keeps us in the top-left quadrant, avoids collision risk, and positions us to grab the apple at (1,6) next turn.\n- Turn 6: eat the apple at (1,6) for +1 apple (now 3). This tightens the score, bringing us level with the rival and giving us momentum to apply pressure on the left edge.\n- Following turns: begin edging toward the left wall to start boxing him in. Use the wall to funnel his options and look for a controlled head-on opportunity only if it\u2019s clearly safe and increases our odds of survival.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES:\n- With the left edge as a natural barrier, we\u2019ll try to create a narrow corridor that limits his maneuvers while keeping ourselves multiple moves away from potential collisions.\n- Stay aware of enemy head movement; if he overextends and we can force a mutual collision in a trapped nook, we\u2019ll take it only if it preserves our lead or mate-guard advantage.\n- Don\u2019t chase the apple unless it\u2019s in a controlled path that doesn\u2019t risk a bad bounce into his line.\n\nMOVE DECISION:\nDOWN",

That's my own body segment (8,5) - the tail!\n\nSo I have 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\nI'm up 4-2 and I need to STAY AGGRESSIVE! The enemy is lurking in the top-left (around (1,7)-(2,8)), so I need to either:\n1) Expand my territory and dominate the center/right\n2) Cut off their escape routes\n3) Find more apples while keeping my body long enough to trap them\n\n**EVALUATING OPTIONS:**\n- **UP to (7,6)**: Moves me toward the top-middle. From there I can go to (7,7) but that's MY tail! Actually (7,7) is the end of my body, so if I go UP twice I'd be moving into my own tail position... But wait, by then my tail will have moved. This gives me access to apples at (7,1), (9,1), (9,4) potentially. Good central position.\n- **DOWN to (7,4)**: Moves me toward bottom center. From (7,4) I can access (9,4) apple, (5,2) apple, (0,2) apple. This seems like a better path to multiple apples!\n- **LEFT to (6,5)**: Moves me slightly left but still center. From there I can access (5,2), (5,8), (5,9) apples. But I'd be getting closer to the enemy's territory (they're at x=1-2).\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going **DOWN to (7,4)**! Here's why:\n1. **Aggressive expansion**: I'm moving toward the bottom where there are multiple apples clustered - (9,4), (5,2), (0,2)\n2. **Avoid enemy**: The enemy is top-left, I'm going bottom-right - keeping distance and avoiding head-on collisions when they might be moving toward me\n3. **Future options**: From (7,4) I have multiple paths to apples and can cut across the bottom\n4. **Score control**: I need to keep extending my 4-2 lead! Every apple counts\n5. **Space**: Bottom gives me more maneuvering room than getting boxed in the top\n\nLet's keep the pressure on! I want to starve the enemy out and keep them in their tiny corner while I dominate the board! \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:**\n\"From (7,4) I'm hunting the (9,4) apple next - it's close and safe. Then I'll sweep down to (5,2) and (0,2) to really snowball my lead. Keep the enemy cornered in the top-left and force them to crash into me or the wall! Stay aggressive, stay alive!\"\n\nDOWN",

From there I can access (5,2) and (0,2) apples, plus the (3,3) apple nearby. This keeps me safe from the enemy's path and gives me room to maneuver.  \n- **LEFT to (6,4)**: Moves me slightly left toward the center. From there I could potentially head toward the (5,2) apple, but I'd be getting closer to the enemy's territory and might risk a future head-on collision.  \n- **RIGHT to (8,4)**: Moves me right toward the right wall. From there I can access the (9,4) apple and then potentially head up to (9,5) and (9,1) apples. This seems like the best path for aggression!  \n\n**THE PLAY:**  \nI'm going **RIGHT to (8,4)**! Here's why:  \n1. **Aggressive expansion**: I'm moving toward the right wall where multiple apples are waiting - (9,4), (9,5), (9,1) - perfect for snowballing my lead!  \n2. **Safe positioning**: The enemy is nowhere near my right side, so I'm avoiding potential collisions while giving myself room to grow.  \n3. **Future dominance**: From (8,4) I can sweep up the right side, collecting apples while keeping the enemy cornered in the top-left.  \n4. **Score control**: I need to extend my 4-3 lead before the enemy gets more apples! Every apple counts.  \n5. **Space management**: The right side gives me plenty of room to maneuver without getting boxed in by my own body.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:**  \n\"From (8,4) I'm hunting the (9,4) apple next - it's right there and safe. Then I'll sweep up to (9,5) and (9,1) to really snowball my lead. Keep the enemy cornered in the top-left and force them to crash into me or the wall! Stay aggressive, stay alive, and dominate the right flank!\"  \n\n**THE CHAT DEMANDS VICTORY! LET'S GOOO!** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc80  \nRIGHT",

UP would crash into our own neck (bad vibes).\n- Why DOWN is the pick: it keeps us compact along the left side, opens a straight path toward the lower Apple corridor (1,2) and (1,0) for a quick growth push, and avoids feeding the opponent any easy trap right now. It also preserves options to swing toward (0,7) later if the window opens. No immediate contact risk with Snake #1.\n- Alternative notes: LEFT would threaten the edge play but delays growth; RIGHT drifts us toward the open center with less immediate apple access. Neither offers a faster growth route than DOWN right now.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Turn 7: Move DOWN to (1,5). Keep a safe, straight path downward to nab the vertical apples along x=1.\n- Turn 8-9: Continue DOWN toward (1,4) and (1,3). Target apple at (1,2) for a solid +1 growth (and a chance to reach (1,0) soon after).\n- If the path to (1,2) gets blocked or the opponent shifts into a corridor, pivot to chase the left-edge apple at (0,7) by turning LEFT and then UP as needed, always watching for collisions.\n- Throughout, avoid any turn that would put us into the opponent\u2019s body or start a dangerous head-on near the center.\n\nTurn-by-turn mindset:\n- Stay alive first, grow second, pressure third. Build a longer, flexible body that can snake toward both vertical apples and opportunistic edge traps.\n\nFinal move (execute now):\nDOWN",

The enemy is still in the top-left (around (1,5)-(1,8)), but they could move toward the center. My goal:  \n1) Secure the apple at (9, 4) to extend my lead.  \n2) Maintain space to avoid trapping myself.  \n3) Keep the enemy cornered while I sweep the right side.  \n\n**EVALUATING OPTIONS:**  \n- **DOWN to (8, 3)**: Moves me toward the bottom center.

Also, from (8, 3), I might have fewer safe moves next turn if I block myself.  \n- **RIGHT to (9, 4)**: Moves me to the right wall, grabbing an apple instantly! This gives me +1 point (now 5 apples vs enemy's 3). From (9, 4), I can then move UP to (9, 5) (another apple) or DOWN to (9, 3) to explore. This path is aggressive, safe, and snowballs my lead.  \n\n**THE PLAY:**  \nI'm going **RIGHT to (9, 4)**! Here's why:  \n1. **Free apple!** (9, 4) has an apple \u2013 I'll grow and extend my lead to 5-3.  \n2. **Aggressive positioning**: Securing the right flank while the enemy is stuck in the top-left.  \n3. **Future options**: From (9, 4), I can go UP to (9, 5) (another apple) or DOWN to (9, 3) to continue expanding.  \n4. **Avoid risk**: Moving DOWN to (8, 3) wastes the apple opportunity and might lead to tighter spaces.  \n5. **Score control**: Every apple counts \u2013 I need to stay ahead!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:**  \n\"From (9, 4), I'll sweep UP to (9, 5) to grab another apple, then maybe DOWN to (9, 3) or LEFT to (8, 4) if safe.

Let's map the battlefield:\n*   **UP to (9, 6):** \u26a0\ufe0f **BLOCKED!** That's my own body segment at (9, 6). Moving there would be suicide.\n*   **DOWN to (9, 4):** \u2705 SAFE! That's my previous position (9, 4) which is now clear (my tail just moved from (8, 6) to somewhere new).\n*   **LEFT to (8, 5):** \u274c **DEADLY!** (8, 5) is part of my current body. My body goes: (9,5) -> (9,4) -> (8,4) -> (7,4) -> (7,5) -> (8,5) -> (8,6). So (8,5) is definitely occupied.\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 5):** \u274c OFF BOARD! X > 9. Game over.\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**  \nWait, actually looking at my body list: Head (9,5), then (9,4), (8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6). So (8,5) is indeed occupied. (9,6) isn't in my body list, but wait... the board shows my body at (9,6)? Let me check the board again...\n\nActually looking at the board state in the prompt:\n```\n 9 . . . . . A . . . .\n 8 . . . . . A . . . .\n 7 A . . A . . . . . .\n 6 . T . . . . . A T .\n 5 . T . . . . . T T 1\n 4 . T . . . . . T T T\n```\nWait, the board shows (9,5) as \"1\" (my head), (8,5) and (7,5) as \"T\", but (9,6) shows as \"T\" in the board state! Let me check the body list again... The body list shows (8,6) as the tail, but the board shows (9,6) as a T. There's a discrepancy!\n\nLooking at the body list provided: [(9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)]\nSo (9,6) is NOT in my body according to the list, but the board shows a T there. The board might be showing where the tail WAS or there's a visual representation issue.\n\nBUT WAIT - if (9,6) shows as T on the board, and I'm at (9,5), moving UP to (9,6) might be dangerous. However, the body list is the authoritative source - it says (8,6) is the tail. So (9,6) should be empty.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n- **UP to (9, 6):** According to body list: SAFE! (9,6) is not in my body. The board might just be showing the tail's previous position or there's a visual artifact. \n- **DOWN to (9, 4):** SAFE! This is my previous head position.\n- **LEFT to (8, 5):** DEADLY! This is definitely my body.\n- **RIGHT:** OFF BOARD.\n\n**THE PLAY:**  \n**UP TO (9, 6)!** Here's why:\n1. **POSITIONING:** Gets me higher on the board, closer to the top-right corner dominance.\n2. **APPLE ACCESS:** From (9,6), I can potentially access (8,6) next turn (my current tail position), and I'm positioning for future apples in the top rows.\n3. **AGGRESSION:** Moving toward the center-top of the board keeps pressure on Snake #0 who's stuck at (1,3).\n4. **NO BETTER OPTION:** DOWN to (9,4) is safe but passive - it keeps me at the same y-level while giving up positioning advantage.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n\"From (9,6), I'll sweep LEFT across the top if safe, aiming for (8,6) which will be empty as my tail moves. Snake #0 is still left-side bound at (1,3) with a short body. I need to control the center and top to force them into a corner. Watch for head-on collisions - with a 6-3 lead, I can afford to be aggressive but not reckless. Next turn, assess (8,6) - if it's clear, take it and continue the sweep. If not, consider DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6) if it becomes safe.\"\n\n**LET'S GOOOO CHAT! UP WE GO!** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc80\n\nUP",
