This is good.\n- Moving RIGHT takes me to (6, 3), which is safe.\n\nI should consider the long-term plan. There are multiple apples available at the bottom left of the board, so going down might be a good idea in the long term. However, the immediate move to the LEFT gets me an apple.\n\nTherefore, my best option is to go LEFT and eat the apple.\n\nNext turn strategy: After getting the apple, re-evaluate the position and prioritize the cluster of apples at (1, 1), (2, 1), and (0, 1).\n\nFinal Answer: LEFT"
