There are five apples in total, and I can see four of them from my current position. The closest apple to me is at (2, 8), but it's a bit far away. I also see an apple at (6, 4), which is a bit more accessible.\n\nNext, I need to consider the position of the enemy snake, which is at (4, 0). It's not too close to me, but I should be aware of its presence.\n\nNow, let's think about my strategy. I want to grow and gain points, so I should aim to move towards the apples. Since the apple at (6, 4) is more accessible, I'll try to move towards that one.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the fact that I'm at the top right corner of the board, and moving down or left might put me in a more vulnerable position. \n\nConsidering all these factors, I think my best move would be to move right, towards the apple at (6, 4).\n\nMy decided next move: RIGHT."

The best move would be to move left towards the apple at (1, 0) to gain a point and grow. Moving left is safe as it doesn't put the snake in danger of hitting the wall or the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching the apple at (1, 0), I will reassess the board to determine the next best move, likely moving up or down to approach the next closest apple while avoiding any potential threats.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
