That\u2019s risky.  \nIf I move LEFT to (7, 1) or RIGHT to (9, 1) or DOWN to (8, 0), no chance of head-on collision with enemy\u2019s possible moves (enemy at y=3, I\u2019m at y=1 or 0).  \n\nSo UP is dangerous due to potential simultaneous collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (9, 0) is 1 step right + 1 step down from me, but not directly reachable in one move.  \n- (1, 0) is far left.  \n- (9, 7) is far up.  \n\nFrom (8, 1):  \n- DOWN to (8, 0) \u2192 next move could go RIGHT to (9, 0) to eat apple.  \n- RIGHT to (9, 1) \u2192 next move DOWN to (9, 0) to eat apple.  \n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT set me up for (9, 0) apple next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Safety and future options:**  \n- DOWN to (8, 0): safe, enemy unlikely to go there. Then from (8, 0) I can go RIGHT to (9, 0) to eat apple, or LEFT to (7, 0) if needed.  \n- RIGHT to (9, 1): safe, then next turn DOWN to (9, 0) to eat apple.  \n\nBoth are fine, but RIGHT keeps me closer to center slightly, DOWN puts me at bottom edge which might limit up/down choices next turn.  \n\nActually, from (8, 0) after eating apple at (9, 0) next turn, I\u2019d grow to length 2, body at (8, 0), head at (9, 0). That\u2019s fine.  \n\nBut maybe RIGHT first is slightly better:  \nFrom (9, 1) I can go DOWN to (9, 0) to eat apple, or UP to (9, 2), or LEFT to (8, 1). More options than from (8, 0).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid enemy future collision:**  \nEnemy at (8, 3) might go for apple at (9, 7) or (1, 7). Not near (9, 0) soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT now to (9, 1), next turn go DOWN to (9, 0) to eat apple, unless enemy moves into (9, 0) simultaneously (unlikely since enemy is far).  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

If enemy moves DOWN to (2, 4) this turn, it will eat the apple before I can reach it.  \nIf enemy does not move DOWN, I can still aim for it, but need to watch next turn.  \n\nOther apples:  \n- (7, 2) \u2013 distance 5.1 from my head.  \n- (9, 0) \u2013 far.  \n- (0, 6) \u2013 far.  \n- (9, 3) \u2013 far.  \n\nUP moves toward (2, 4) but risks enemy taking it first or moving into (2, 3) next turn.  \nLEFT moves toward (0, 6) but very indirect.  \nRIGHT moves toward (7, 2) and bottom-row apples.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each move**  \nIf UP to (2, 2): body head (2, 2), tail (1, 0). Next turn from (2, 2):  \n- UP (2, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 1) \u2013 my body \u2192 no.  \n- LEFT (1, 2) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (3, 2) \u2013 empty.  \n\u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \n\nIf LEFT to (1, 1): body head (1, 1), tail (1, 0). Next turn from (1, 1):  \n- UP (1, 2) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (1, 0) \u2013 my body \u2192 no.  \n- LEFT (0, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 1) \u2013 my body \u2192 no.  \n\u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (3, 1): body head (3, 1), tail (1, 0). Next turn from (3, 1):  \n- UP (3, 2) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (3, 0) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (2, 1) \u2013 my body \u2192 no.  \n- RIGHT (4, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n\u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat near (2, 4)**  \nEnemy at (2, 5) could go DOWN to (2, 4) this turn and eat it. If I go UP to (2, 2), I\u2019m moving toward a possibly disappearing apple.  \nBut if enemy goes LEFT, RIGHT, or UP, apple remains.  \nGiven enemy\u2019s body extends upward, it might prefer to go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN to avoid trapping itself. DOWN to (2, 4) is a logical move for it to eat apple and grow.  \nThus, assuming enemy will take (2, 4) this turn, I should not commit fully toward it.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Alternative plan**  \nGo RIGHT to (3, 1) to move toward (7, 2) apple and keep space. This opens more options next turn (UP/DOWN/RIGHT) and avoids potential head-on with enemy if it moves toward (2, 4) then (2, 3).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (3, 1), assess if (2, 4) apple is gone. If gone, target (7, 2) via (4, 1) \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 (6, 2) \u2192 (7, 2) or similar. Keep distance from enemy head (currently at (2, 5) or new position).  \n\nRIGHT",

I need apples but must avoid enemy.  \nFrom (5, 3), I can go DOWN next turn to (5, 2), then LEFT to (4, 2), then DOWN to (4, 1) for apple.  \nThat path seems safe: enemy is far above.  \n\nIf I go DOWN now to (6, 2), next turn I could go LEFT to (5, 2) then same path.  \nBut being at (6, 2) is closer to bottom row where my tail was, which might be safer from enemy but also farther from other apples like (0, 6) later.  \n\nActually, (0, 6) is far; (4, 1) is priority.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid enemy\u2019s possible path**  \nEnemy at (7, 8) might go DOWN toward (7, 5) apple. That means in 3 turns enemy could be near row 5. If I go LEFT now to (5, 3), I\u2019ll be moving left away from column 7, so safer.  \nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2), I\u2019m still in column 6, slightly closer to enemy\u2019s vertical path.  \n\nSo LEFT seems slightly safer regarding enemy movement.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nBoth DOWN and LEFT are safe and give good future options.  \nLEFT moves me toward apple (4, 1) and away from enemy\u2019s likely downward path.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (5, 3), go DOWN to (5, 2), then LEFT to (4, 2), then DOWN to (4, 1) to eat apple.

So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 2):  \nNext turn body: [(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)], neck at (5, 3).  \nFrom (5, 2): UP (5, 3) neck \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (5, 1) empty, LEFT (4, 2) empty, RIGHT (6, 2) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 3):  \nNext turn body: [(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)], neck at (5, 3).  \nFrom (4, 3): UP (4, 4) empty, DOWN (4, 2) empty, LEFT (3, 3) empty, RIGHT (5, 3) neck \u2192 unsafe. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAll give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nClosest apple is (4, 1) at distance |5-4|+|3-1| = 3 from current (5, 3).  \nGoing LEFT to (4, 3) reduces distance to (4, 1) to |4-4|+|3-1| = 2.  \nGoing DOWN to (5, 2) reduces distance to (4, 1) to |5-4|+|2-1| = 2 as well.  \nGoing UP to (5, 4) increases distance to (4, 1) to 4.  \n\nSo UP is less efficient for nearest apple.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy at (7, 7) can go DOWN to (7, 6) this turn. If I go DOWN to (5, 2), I\u2019m moving away from enemy\u2019s vertical path. If I go LEFT to (4, 3), I\u2019m moving horizontally away but staying in row 3, which is closer to enemy if enemy moves down multiple steps.  \nActually, enemy length is 7, mine is 5, so I want to avoid being in same row/col when enemy could cut me off.  \nFrom (4, 3), I can go DOWN next turn to (4, 2), then DOWN to (4, 1) for apple. That path is far from enemy\u2019s current position.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nGoal: eat (4, 1) safely, then consider (0, 6) or (9, 0) later.  \nFrom (4, 3), going DOWN next turn is safe. From (5, 2), going LEFT next turn is safe. Both lead to apple in 2 moves.  \nBut if I go LEFT now to (4, 3), I\u2019m closer to left wall, which may limit escape routes later. However, board is open on left side.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT and DOWN both good.  \nLEFT gets me closer to apple while moving away from enemy\u2019s column (7).  \nDOWN also moves away from enemy but slightly less directly toward apple.  \nI\u2019ll choose LEFT to minimize steps to apple and maximize horizontal separation from enemy.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (4, 3), go DOWN to (4, 2), then DOWN to (4, 1) to eat apple. After that, assess enemy position and decide whether to go toward (0, 6) or (9, 0). Keep avoiding enemy\u2019s longer body.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT positions me in the rightmost column, closer to (9, 7).  \n\nBut maybe check safety:  \nRIGHT (9, 5) leaves me with edges: from (9, 5) next turn: UP (9, 6) \u2705, DOWN (9, 4) \u2705, LEFT (8, 5) neck \u2192 unsafe; so 2 moves safe next turn.  \nUP (8, 6) next turn: UP (8, 7) empty \u2705, DOWN (8, 5) neck unsafe, LEFT (7, 6) empty \u2705, RIGHT (9, 6) empty \u2705 \u21d2 3 moves safe.  \n\nSo UP offers better mobility for next turn than RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Avoid dead ends**  \nDOWN (8, 4) heads away from (9, 7); could still work later but less direct toward nearest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Future maneuvering**  \nFrom UP (8, 6): ensure enemy can\u2019t cut me off later \u2014 enemy is far away at (7, 2), so no immediate risk.  \n\nPlan: Go UP now for flexibility, approach (9, 7) in 2 turns via (8, 6) \u2192 (9, 6) \u2192 (9, 7).

Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (9, 7) \u2014 RIGHT now eats it immediately.

So 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 not too bad.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Compare options:**  \n- RIGHT: eat apple now, slightly reduced mobility next turn but still 2 moves.  \n- UP: go to (8, 8), still 2 apples nearby \u2014 (9, 7) and (3, 9). Next turn from (8, 8): UP (8, 9), DOWN (8, 7) body \u274c, LEFT (7, 8), RIGHT (9, 8) \u2192 3 safe moves. Good mobility.  \n- LEFT: go to (7, 7), moves me away from nearest apple but centralizes position. From (7, 7): UP (7, 8), DOWN (7, 6), LEFT (6, 7) body \u274c, RIGHT (8, 7) body \u274c \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nRIGHT gives immediate apple, UP gives flexibility, LEFT is less ideal for apple gathering.  \n\nGiven my score is 8 apples vs enemy\u2019s 6, gaining an apple extends my lead and gets me closer to 30.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Risk of enemy cutting me off later:**  \nEnemy is far away at (7, 0), so no immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I eat apple now at (9, 7), next turn I can go UP or DOWN to stay safe and plan path to another apple.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

It might aim for (3, 9) or (0, 8).  \nNo immediate collision risk for me this turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each safe move**  \n- UP to (5, 4): then UP (5,5) empty, DOWN (5,3) my body unsafe, LEFT (4,4) empty, RIGHT (6,4) empty \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- DOWN to (5, 2): then UP (5,3) my body unsafe, DOWN (5,1) empty, LEFT (4,2) empty, RIGHT (6,2) my body unsafe \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n- LEFT to (4, 3): then UP (4,4) empty, DOWN (4,2) empty, LEFT (3,3) empty, RIGHT (5,3) my body unsafe \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nUP and LEFT give 3 safe follow-ups, DOWN gives only 2.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Path to apple (3, 2)**  \nFrom (5, 3):  \n- DOWN to (5, 2) \u2192 distance to (3, 2) = 2+0 = 2  \n- LEFT to (4, 3) \u2192 distance = 1+1 = 2  \n- UP to (5, 4) \u2192 distance = 2+2 = 4  \n\nDOWN and LEFT are equally close, but DOWN reduces future options.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk of trapping**  \nMy tail is at (7, 0), moving toward (8, 0) next turn? Actually, my body: head (5,3), then (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), (7,0). When I move without eating, tail will move from (7,0) to (8,0)? Wait, the body list is head-to-tail, so tail is last coordinate (7,0). On a non-apple move, the tail segment disappears from (7,0) and a new head appears at the chosen direction. That means (7,0) becomes empty next turn, but (8,0) remains part of my body. So moving toward bottom right could still be tight.  \n\nLEFT opens space toward left side, away from enemy and my own crowded right side.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT to (4, 3) keeps 3 safe follow-ups, moves toward (3, 2) (distance 2), avoids enemy, and leaves room to maneuver. DOWN is tempting for immediate closeness but reduces options next turn, which could be dangerous if enemy approaches later. UP moves away from closest apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (4, 3), consider DOWN to (4, 2) to approach (3, 2), but check enemy movement. If enemy moves toward (3, 9), I can go for (0, 6) instead. Avoid moving into right side where my body blocks.\n\nLEFT",

LEFT moves me toward the left side where there\u2019s more space and apples (0, 6) and (0, 8) later. DOWN keeps me near my body line.  \nGiven enemy is going up, I prefer LEFT to (3, 3) because:  \n1. It still allows DOWN next turn to eat (3, 2).  \n2. It opens more space on left side.  \n3. Avoids staying too close to my own body cluster on right.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (3, 3), go DOWN to eat (3, 2) unless enemy suddenly moves toward me.

That leaves me in lower left area with space to move toward (0, 6) or (0, 8) later.  \nEnemy is far away and constrained at top row; it might move toward (9, 4) apple eventually, but not an immediate threat.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN gives:  \n- Immediate apple (catch up in score, enemy has 10 vs my 7 after this).  \n- Still 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- Moves me toward left side apples for future.  \n- No risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\nLEFT or UP delay eating, letting enemy possibly get further ahead.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating (3, 2), consider path to (0, 6) via LEFT/DOWN moves, staying clear of enemy\u2019s likely path to (9, 4).

Wait, (5, 3) is my body currently, but after moving, tail moves only if no apple eaten. Since no apple now, tail will move next turn (tail at (8, 2) moves forward as head moves, so body shifts). Actually, if no apple eaten, tail cell (8, 2) becomes empty next turn. So path to (6, 5) will clear over time.  \nBetter immediate: DOWN now, then RIGHT next turn to (4, 1), then RIGHT to (5, 1), then UP to (5, 2), then RIGHT to (6, 2), then UP toward (6, 5).  \nWatch enemy moving toward left apples; maybe they go for (0, 6) or (0, 8), so I can take right-side apples (6, 5) and (9, 4) uncontested.\n\nDOWN",

From there:  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 10) off-board \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 8): empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 9): empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 9): its own body \u2192 unsafe  \n\nEnemy can go DOWN to (1, 8) or LEFT to (0, 9). Both move toward left-side apples (0, 6) or (0, 8). No immediate collision risk with me.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each safe move**  \n- DOWN to (3, 0): then UP (3, 1) my body unsafe, DOWN off-board, LEFT (2, 0) empty, RIGHT (4, 0) empty \u2192 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n- LEFT to (2, 1): then UP (2, 2) empty, DOWN (2, 0) empty, LEFT (1, 1) empty, RIGHT (3, 1) my body unsafe \u2192 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n- RIGHT to (4, 1): then UP (4, 2) empty, DOWN (4, 0) empty, LEFT (3, 1) my body unsafe, RIGHT (5, 1) empty \u2192 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nLEFT and RIGHT give more future safe moves (3 vs 2).\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Path to nearest apple (6, 5)**  \nFrom (3, 1), moving RIGHT gets me closer to (6, 5) (x increases). Moving LEFT takes me away. Moving DOWN to (3, 0) delays approach.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk of trapping**  \nMy tail is at (8, 3) after moving? Wait, if I move without eating apple, tail moves from (8, 3) to (7, 3)? Actually body shifts: head moves, each segment moves forward, last segment (tail) vacates. So after move, tail will be at (7, 3). That opens space gradually. Moving RIGHT to (4, 1) keeps me in open lower area, avoids enemy\u2019s upper region.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy could move DOWN to (1, 8) or LEFT to (0, 9). Neither conflicts with my RIGHT to (4, 1). Safe.\n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy is far left-top, going for left apples. I should go for right-side apples: (6, 5) first, then maybe (9, 4) or (9, 0).  \nRIGHT now to (4, 1), then next turn go UP to (4, 2) (if safe), then RIGHT to (5, 2), then UP toward (6, 5).

Wait, actually |5-4|=1, |1-2|=1, total 2).  \nBut (4, 2) is directly above-left from head: from (5,1), UP then LEFT gets it in 2 moves.  \nOther apples: (6, 5) distance 5, (9, 4) distance 7, (9, 0) distance 13, (0, 6) distance 10.  \n(4, 2) is very close and reachable via UP then LEFT next turn if safe.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy head at (0, 8). It can move DOWN to (0, 7), LEFT off-board (dead), RIGHT to (1, 8) its body, UP off-board (dead). So only safe move for enemy is DOWN to (0, 7). Enemy will move away from me, no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each safe move**  \n- UP to (5, 2): then UP (5, 3) my body unsafe, DOWN (5, 1) my body unsafe, LEFT (4, 2) apple (safe unless enemy?), RIGHT (6, 2) empty \u2192 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n- DOWN to (5, 0): then UP (5, 1) my body unsafe, DOWN off-board, LEFT (4, 0) empty, RIGHT (6, 0) empty \u2192 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n- RIGHT to (6, 1): then UP (6, 2) empty, DOWN (6, 0) empty, LEFT (5, 1) my body unsafe, RIGHT (7, 1) empty \u2192 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nRIGHT again gives most future safe moves (3). UP gives 2 but puts me next to apple (4, 2) for next turn.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Path to nearest apple (4, 2)**  \nFrom (5, 1), moving UP to (5, 2) puts me adjacent to (4, 2). Next turn I could go LEFT to eat it if (4, 2) stays empty (enemy far).  \nBut check: (4, 2) is currently empty (board shows A at (4, 2)? Wait, board shows A at (4, 2) in grid? Yes, at y=2, x=4 there is 'A' in board state. So apple at (4, 2) is present. Good.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk of trapping**  \nUP to (5, 2) leaves only LEFT and RIGHT next turn, but LEFT leads to apple (4, 2) which is safe unless enemy somehow reaches it (impossible in 1 turn from (0, 8)). Eating apple will grow me, tail stays at (6, 3) for now, so after eating, my body length increases, but path after eating needs checking: after eating at (4, 2), new head there, body behind me: (5, 2) becomes new second segment. Then possible moves from (4, 2) need evaluation next turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy only safe move is DOWN to (0, 7), far away. No conflict.\n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy has 11 apples vs my 7. I need to catch up. (4, 2) is easy apple. After eating it, I\u2019ll have 8 apples, still behind. Next target could be (6, 5) or (9, 4).  \nRIGHT to (6, 1) avoids immediate apple but keeps more options open. However, taking the apple now is low risk and gains a point.  \n\n**Step 10 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP to (5, 2) \u2192 next turn go LEFT to (4, 2) to eat apple. That\u2019s a clear 2-turn plan with minimal risk (enemy far).  \nRIGHT gives more flexibility but delays eating. Given enemy is far and apple is close, taking it now is good.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf UP now, next turn go LEFT to eat apple at (4, 2) unless something unexpected happens. After eating, assess path to (6, 5) via (4, 3) or (5, 3) etc., but note my body at (4, 3) and (5, 3) currently, but tail may move.  \n\nUP",

Its safe moves: UP to (0, 8) its body? Wait, (0, 8) is its body segment, so unsafe. DOWN to (0, 6) empty, LEFT off-board, RIGHT to (1, 7) empty. So enemy can go DOWN or RIGHT.  \nFrom (0, 7) to (4, 2) is Manhattan distance 9, so no immediate collision risk.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each safe move**  \n- LEFT to (4, 2) (eat apple):  \n  After eating, new head at (4, 2), body becomes [(5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)] (tail still at (5, 3) for now).  \n  From (4, 2), next turn moves: UP (4, 3) my body unsafe, DOWN (4, 1) my body unsafe, LEFT (3, 2) my body unsafe, RIGHT (5, 2) my body unsafe \u2192 all blocked unless tail moves.  \n  But tail will move next turn because I didn\u2019t eat last turn (last move was UP from (5,1) to (5,2), no apple eaten). So tail at (5, 3) will move away when I move this turn. Let\u2019s trace: current body: head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) tail.  \n  If I move LEFT to (4,2) and eat apple, new head (4,2), new second segment (5,2), rest shift: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and tail stays at (5,3) because growth adds segment at head, so length increases by 1, tail stays one extra turn. Actually: after eating, tail doesn\u2019t move this turn, so tail remains at (5,3). Next turn when I move, tail will move (since no new apple eaten then). So from (4,2) next turn, possible moves: UP (4,3) occupied by my body (segment before tail), DOWN (4,1) occupied, LEFT (3,2) occupied, RIGHT (5,2) occupied \u2192 all blocked. That\u2019s a trap!  \n\nWait, recheck: current body length 8 (head + 7 segments). After eating apple, length becomes 9. Tail stays at (5,3) until next move. So next turn from (4,2), all adjacent cells are occupied: (4,3) is my body (the 8th segment before tail), (4,1) is my body, (3,2) is my body, (5,2) is my body. So I\u2019d have zero safe moves next turn \u2192 death.  \n\n- RIGHT to (6, 2):  \n  From (6, 2), next turn moves: UP (6, 3) empty, DOWN (6, 1) empty, LEFT (5, 2) will be empty after I move? Actually after I move RIGHT, my old head (5,2) becomes body segment, so (5,2) occupied. So LEFT to (5,2) unsafe. RIGHT (7,2) empty. So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Trap avoidance**  \nLEFT leads to immediate apple but traps me next turn with no escape. RIGHT avoids trap and keeps options open.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI need to avoid trapping myself. Eating (4, 2) now is suicidal. Better to go RIGHT to (6, 2), then aim for apple at (6, 5) via a safe path. Enemy is far, no immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nOnly RIGHT is safe long-term. LEFT kills me next turn.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait no, future head will be 1,3, up is 1,4 \u2014 which is empty now but blocked? Let\u2019s check carefully: If I move to (1,3), my body segments at start of next turn: old head (1,4) becomes body segment 1; snake moves forward so body list shifts head to (1,3), segment 1=(1,4), etc. So next turn, UP from (1,3) is (1,4) which now is body  \u274c \u2014 so UP blocked. So from (1,3): UP: body\u274c, DOWN: (1,2)\u2705, LEFT: (0,3)\u2705, RIGHT: (2,3)\u2705 \u2192 3 moves.  \n- RIGHT (2, 4): UP: (2,5)\u2705, DOWN: (2,3)\u2705, LEFT: (1,4)\u2705, RIGHT: (3,4)\u2705 \u2192 4 moves.\n\nSo LEFT worst mobility (2 moves), DOWN gives 3 moves, RIGHT gives 4 moves.\n\nDOWN safer toward apple (4, 2) direction without risking enemy path yet.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT keeps mobility but drifts toward enemy territory \u2014 too risky if enemy goes LEFT to (5,5). DOWN moves away from enemy and paths nicely to (4,2) apple with enough mobility.\n\nPlan: Next turn, from (1,3), go to (2,3) etc. toward (4,2). Avoid center until enemy moves away.\n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s risky.  \n\nSo RIGHT is bad for future options.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy at (2, 2) can reach (3, 2) or (2, 3) or (2, 1) or (1, 2) (body).  \nApple (4, 2) is 2 steps from enemy, 1 step from me if I go DOWN now. If I go DOWN to (4, 3), enemy could go RIGHT to (3, 2) then UP to (3, 3) or RIGHT to (4, 2) next turn. But if I go DOWN now, next turn I can go DOWN to (4, 2) and eat apple before enemy gets there (enemy would need two turns to reach (4, 2) unless they go RIGHT then UP, but that\u2019s also two turns).  \n\nActually:  \nEnemy paths to (4, 2):  \n- (2, 2) \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 (4, 2) (two moves)  \n- (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (4, 2) (longer)  \n\nI can be at (4, 3) this turn, then next turn DOWN to (4, 2) and eat apple. Enemy can\u2019t reach (4, 2) before me unless they go (3, 2) this turn and (4, 2) next turn simultaneously with me \u2014 but if they do, that\u2019s a head-on collision on (4, 2) next turn if I go there.  \n\nCheck: If enemy goes RIGHT to (3, 2) this turn, and I go DOWN to (4, 3) this turn, then next turn enemy could go RIGHT to (4, 2) and I go DOWN to (4, 2) \u2192 both die. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nSo maybe I should avoid racing for that apple if enemy might head there.  \n\nLet\u2019s see enemy\u2019s likely move:  \nFrom (2, 2), safe moves:  \nUP (2, 3) empty, DOWN (2, 1) empty, LEFT (1, 2) body, RIGHT (3, 2) empty.  \nEnemy might go toward apple (4, 2) via RIGHT, or go UP toward their own body area.  \n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (3, 2), then I should not go for (4, 2) next turn.  \n\nBut I can decide next turn based on where enemy moves. For now, DOWN still gives me options: from (4, 3) I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (if safe).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT is bad (only 1 safe move next turn).  \nLEFT is safe but moves away from closest apple.  \nDOWN is safe and keeps options open, and I can decide next turn whether to grab apple based on enemy\u2019s new position.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nGo DOWN to (4, 3). Next turn, check enemy head position. If enemy is at (3, 2), avoid (4, 2) and go LEFT or RIGHT from (4, 3). If enemy not near, take apple at (4, 2).  \n\nDOWN",

Possibly they go UP or DOWN instead. Still, it\u2019s a gamble.  \n\n**LEFT to (3, 3)**  \n- No apple.  \n- If enemy goes UP to (3, 3), we die.  \n- Enemy\u2019s UP is safe for them unless I go there.  \n\n**RIGHT to (5, 3)**  \n- No apple.  \n- No possible head-on collision this turn.  \n- Next turn from (5, 3): check options: UP (5, 4) my body, DOWN (5, 2) my body, LEFT (4, 3) empty, RIGHT (6, 3) my body \u2192 only LEFT is safe next turn. That\u2019s a dead-end next turn.  \n\nSo RIGHT is safe this turn but traps me next turn (only 1 safe move).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare risks**  \nRIGHT avoids immediate head-on risk but puts me in a corner next turn with only 1 move.  \nDOWN risks head-on collision but gets apple and possibly survives if enemy doesn\u2019t choose RIGHT.  \nLEFT risks head-on collision with no apple benefit.  \n\nEnemy\u2019s perspective:  \nFrom (3, 2), they see my head at (4, 3).  \nThey might think:  \n- If they go RIGHT to (4, 2), they risk me going DOWN to (4, 2) and both die.  \n- If they go UP to (3, 3), they risk me going LEFT to (3, 3) and both die.  \nSo they might choose DOWN to (3, 1) as safest.  \n\nIf enemy chooses DOWN, then DOWN and LEFT are safe for me.  \n\nBut I can\u2019t be sure.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future safety after possible moves**  \nIf I go DOWN and survive (enemy doesn\u2019t go RIGHT), I eat apple, grow, and next turn from (4, 2):  \nPossible moves: UP (4, 3) empty, DOWN (4, 1) empty, LEFT (3, 2) enemy\u2019s current head position (but enemy will move), RIGHT (5, 2) my body.  \nSo likely 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN).  \n\nIf I go LEFT and survive (enemy doesn\u2019t go UP), next turn from (3, 3):  \nPossible moves: UP (3, 4) empty, DOWN (3, 2) enemy\u2019s current head position, LEFT (2, 3) empty, RIGHT (4, 3) empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn unless enemy moves into one.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT, only 1 safe move next turn \u2014 too risky.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT is eliminated (future trap).  \nBetween DOWN and LEFT:  \n- DOWN gets apple, higher reward, moderate risk of head-on.  \n- LEFT no apple, moderate risk of head-on, better future options if survive.  \n\nGiven enemy is ahead in apples (12 vs my 9), I need to catch up. Taking the apple at (4, 2) is valuable if I can do it safely.  \n\nI think enemy will avoid (4, 2) because they see my head adjacent and might fear collision. They might go DOWN to (3, 1) or UP to (3, 3). If they go UP, then my DOWN is safe. If they go DOWN, my DOWN is safe. Only if they go RIGHT do we collide.  \n\nBut they have 3 safe moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN.  \nProbability they go RIGHT = 1/3. That\u2019s a 33% chance of death if I go DOWN.  \n\nThat\u2019s too high. I should avoid gambling when I have another safe-ish option.  \n\nLEFT has same 33% chance if they go UP.  \n\nBut if they go UP, they might think I go DOWN for apple, so they might avoid (3, 3) expecting me to go LEFT? Hard to predict.  \n\nGiven both DOWN and LEFT have equal collision risk this turn, but DOWN gives apple, I\u2019ll take DOWN for the reward.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nIf I survive and eat apple, next turn avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s new head if it\u2019s adjacent. From (4, 2), prioritize moving UP or DOWN to open space unless enemy blocks.  \n\nDOWN",

Body:  \n[(3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9)]  \n\nAfter head moves, the neck (2, 2) is off-limits (backwards suicide).  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy Snake 0:**  \nHead at (4, 3), body: [(4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)].  \n\nImportant: Enemy snake\u2019s possible moves from (4, 3): UP to (4, 4) \u2192 body (safe? NO, hits itself), so UP not safe for snake 0.  \nLEFT to (3, 3) \u2014 empty (my head is at (3, 2) now).  \nDOWN to (4, 2) \u2014 apple there, probably safe.  \nRIGHT to (5, 3) \u2014 empty.  \n\nBut key: enemy head could move to (3, 3), which might be where I go if I go UP from (3, 2). That would be a head-on collision if we both go there. Enemy could also go DOWN to the apple.\n\n---\n\n**Check my possible moves** from (3, 2):\n\n1. **UP** to (3, 3):  \n   - Not off board.  \n   - Not my body: my body positions after move: head moves from (3, 2) to (3, 3); tail moves forward so old head becomes neck, tail segment at (2, 9) disappears? Actually length = 13 (12 apples + initial 1 head). Wait: Starting body length = 1 + 12 apples = 13 segments. Already listed body coords: I count 13 segments including head. So when moving, head moves forward, neck becomes (2, 2) still part of body? Yes \u2014 entire body shifts forward one cell; tail cell (2, 9) remains or moves? Correction: head goes to new position, neck (2, 2) becomes first body segment. Last segment (2, 9) disappears only if no apple eaten. So no apple eaten \u2192 length stays 13. Therefore positions occupied by my body after move are: all except tail (2, 9), new head at (3, 3), body from (3, 2) onwards down to (1, 9). So (3, 3) not in body \u2014 safe.  \n   - Enemy could also choose (3, 3) if he goes LEFT from (4, 3). Would that kill us both? Yes \u2014 head-on collision. So risky.\n\n2. **RIGHT** to (4, 2):  \n   - That\u2019s where apple is.  \n   - But Snake 0 head at (4, 3) could go DOWN to (4, 2) \u2014 again possible head-on collision. Eating apple: if we both go there \u2192 both die.  \n\n3. **DOWN** to (3, 1):  \n   - Empty cell currently.  \n   - Enemy can\u2019t get there in one move except from (3, 2) \u2014 impossible. So no collision danger.  \n   - Safe? Check my body: (3, 1) not in my body (body has (2, 2), etc.), safe from self-collision.  \n   - On board? Yes.\n\n4. **LEFT** to (2, 2):  \n   - That\u2019s exactly my neck \u2014 collision with own body \u2192 immediate death. Not allowed.\n\nSo LEFT \u2014 forbidden.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk assessment:**  \n- UP \u2192 possible head-on with enemy if he goes LEFT.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 possible head-on with enemy if he goes DOWN (to eat apple).  \n- DOWN \u2192 safe from enemy head collision (enemy too far).  \n\nGiven enemy might go for apple at (4, 2), RIGHT is dangerous. Apple at (9, 0), (9, 4), (4, 2), (8, 8), (8, 1). Closest apples: (4, 2) directly RIGHT, (8, 1) far.  \n\nConsidering safety first: DOWN seems safest: avoids possible collision, keeps options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Future plan note:**  \nFrom (3, 1), next turn I can go LEFT (2, 1), RIGHT (4, 1), DOWN (3, 0), or UP back to (3, 2). That\u2019s enough space. I should aim toward bottom-left apples eventually if possible, but now avoid snake 0 who\u2019s near (4, 3) and might stay central.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

So tail is at (1, 9).\nNot eating an apple this turn means tail moves \u2014 last segment disappears, new tail becomes (0, 8).\n\n**Enemy snake 0 (head at (4, 2)):**\nBody: [(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)]. So tail at (5, 1).\n\n---\n\n**Possible moves for me from (3, 1):**\n\n1. **UP to (3, 2)**: is currently my neck. After tail moves, (3, 2) is still part of my body (the segment behind head becomes neck). So it's suicide. \u2192 **Not allowed.**\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 0)**: safe \u2014 not off-board, not in my body (body has (3, 2)... far). Not in enemy body currently (enemy body: check: (3,0) not in their list). Enemy head could move there from (4,2)?  \n   - Enemy can't get to (3,0) in one move except from (3,1) (occupied by me) or (4,0) (far). So no head-on risk.  \n   \u2192 **Safe.**\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 1)**: safe \u2014 not off-board, not in my body, not in enemy body currently.  \n   Enemy possible moves from (4,2):  \n   UP\u2192(4,3) which is its body (suicide for it), so not likely.  \n   LEFT\u2192(3,2) my body so suicide for it (safe for me).  \n   DOWN\u2192(4,1) then possible future risk? No, immediate head-on only if enemy goes to same cell. Could enemy go to (2,1)? No, too far. \u2192 **Safe.**\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 1)**:  \n   - Check: not off-board, not in my body.  \n   - Enemy body: (4,1) is enemy tail (5, 1 is tail, 4,1 is??? Wait: enemy body: head (4,2), then (4,3), ..., tail at (5,1). So (4,1) is not in enemy body now.  \n   BUT could enemy go to (4,1) in its move?  \n   From (4,2), enemy can go LEFT (3,2) hits my body \u2192 suicide, UP (4,3) hits its own body (suicide), DOWN (4,1) is safe for it, RIGHT (5,2) hits its own body? Wait: its body: (5,2) is in enemy body (yes: ...(6,2), (5,2) is 2nd last segment? Check: head (4,2), next (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1 tail). So (5,2) is in their body. So RIGHT from (4,2) is suicide for enemy.) So actually enemy's safe moves are only: DOWN to (4,1).  \n   Thus if I go RIGHT to (4,1), enemy will also go there \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \n   \u2192 **Risky. Avoid.**\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT and DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Strategic planning:**\n\nFrom (3,1):\n\nGOALS: Avoid enemy head collision. Eat apples: apples at (9,0), (9,4), (8,8), (8,1), (0,2). Closest: (0,2) but blocked by my body along top path; (8,1) is near enemy. (9,0) far.\n\nLEFT (2,1):  \nNext moves: could go DOWN (2,0) then left to (1,0) then (0,0) toward apple (9,0) via bottom \u2014 but that's far. Could go UP (2,2) but that's my body after move. Need to check later.\n\nDOWN (3,0):  \nNext moves: could go LEFT (2,0) or RIGHT (4,0) or UP back to (3,1). From (3,0) maybe easier to go around bottom edge toward (9,0).\n\n**Best choice**: DOWN to stay clear of enemy and go for (9,0) apple eventually.  \n\n**Long-term plan**: Encircle board\u2019s bottom edge to get (9,0) while avoiding enemy in center-top. From (3,0), next turn go left along y=0 toward west side apples.\n\nSAFE: DOWN or LEFT, but DOWN positions me better for future toward apple (9,0).\n\nDOWN",

If they go RIGHT, they risk death if I go DOWN.  \n- Since they can see my only safe move is DOWN, they\u2019d likely avoid RIGHT unless suicidal.  \n\nBut they might think: \u201cIf I go RIGHT, maybe he won\u2019t go DOWN because he sees the risk.\u201d But I have no other safe move, so I must go DOWN. They can deduce that. So they should go LEFT.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Is there any alternative?**  \nNo, only DOWN is safe from immediate body/board death. So I must go DOWN and hope enemy chooses LEFT.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future planning if I survive**  \nIf I survive, I\u2019ll be at (4, 0). Next turn from (4, 0):  \nPossible moves: UP (4, 1) empty (my old head), DOWN off board \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (3, 0) enemy\u2019s current head (but enemy will move), RIGHT (5, 0) empty.  \nSo likely safe moves next turn: UP, RIGHT.  \nNeed to avoid enemy\u2019s new head if adjacent.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn**  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (2, 0), then from (4, 0) I can go UP or RIGHT.  \nApple at (9, 0) is far but reachable via rightward moves along bottom row if safe.  \nApple at (8, 1) is closer but need to avoid enemy\u2019s possible path.  \nFirst priority next turn: check enemy\u2019s new head location, then pick safest move toward open space/apple while keeping options open.  \n\nGiven only one safe move:  \n\nDOWN",

Enemy? enemy body segments: (4,1), (4,2), etc. None at (1,0). So safe.  \n**RIGHT to (3,0)**: That's my body segment \u2014 suicide. So not allowed.  \n\nSo I have **UP** and **LEFT** as safe moves from immediate dangers.  \n\n**Now consider enemy\u2019s possible moves from (4,0)**:  \nEnemy body: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]  \nMoves for enemy from (4,0):  \n- UP: (4,1) \u2014 own body \u2192 suicide \u2192 not allowed.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT: (3,0) \u2014 that\u2019s my body segment if my new head not there yet? Actually, current state: (3,0) is my body segment right after my head\u2019s previous position \u2192 so enemy moving LEFT into (3,0) means collision with my body \u2192 enemy dies.  \n- RIGHT: (5,0) \u2014 empty, board safe? Check: enemy body not on (5,0), my body not on (5,0). Could enemy go there? yes.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is **RIGHT to (5,0)**.  \n\nThat means **no head-on collision risk** in my considered moves, since enemy will not choose suicide moves.  \n\n**Now best strategic move**:  \nApple at (0,2) is closest: two steps away via LEFT then UP (1,0) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2)? wait but (1,2) is my body!! So I need to get (0,2) without hitting myself. Possibly not yet possible directly unless tail advances after moving. Let\u2019s check path after tail moves\u2014body length doesn't change unless we eat an apple. Apples available: (9,0) far, (0,2) near but blocked by my body (segment (1,2) right above (1,0)) so I might not reach (0,2) directly yet without going around.  \n\nFrom (2,0):  \n- UP to (2,1): avoids bottom edge, more space. After tail moves, my body will change; but still must check next moves: from (2,1), can go left to (1,1) then up to (1,2) maybe after body moves away when tail moves\u2014risky if timing wrong; could go right to (3,1) but (3,1) is my body currently\u2014next turn that might shift? Actually, tail will advance because we moved last turn without eating apple\u2014killing our tail end (0,8). That means body segments shift by one, so (3,0) becomes head\u2019s old pos, and the last segment disappears. Let's simulate:  \n\nLast turn: head moved from (3,0) to (2,0). Body was: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ... (0,8). After move: new body is [(2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), ... (0,7)], right? Actually, no: current state given already includes the new head at (2,0) and body is [(3,0), (3,1), ... (0,8)] \u2014 that's old body without including new head? Wait, description says \"Body: \" lists first tuple after head? Actually the board shows '1' at (2,0), 'T' at (3,0), etc.  \n\nSo (3,0) is my body now, so snake layout correct. Anyway, not important \u2014 the safe paths:  \n\nLEFT to (1,0): bottom edge, next moves: from (1,0) can go up to (1,1), but (1,2) is body? Yes, (1,2) body, so cannot go (1,1)\u2192(1,2) next turn; would trap me.  \n\nBetter: UP to (2,1) gives more flexibility: from (2,1) can go left, right, or up. Seems safe, keeps options open.  \n\n**Controlled approach**: go UP to keep central mobility rather than hugging edge.  \n\n**Future plan**: From (2,1), consider path toward apples, maybe (9,0) via bottom later.  \n\nUP",

No immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\nIf I go UP to (6, 1):  \nNext turn from (6, 1): possible moves:  \nUP (6, 2) \u2013 empty  \nDOWN (6, 0) \u2013 empty (old head)  \nLEFT (5, 1) \u2013 empty  \nRIGHT (7, 1) \u2013 empty  \nSo 4 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 0):  \nNext turn from (7, 0): possible moves:  \nUP (7, 1) \u2013 empty  \nDOWN \u2013 off board  \nLEFT (6, 0) \u2013 empty  \nRIGHT (8, 0) \u2013 empty  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nUP gives slightly more future options.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApple at (9, 0) is 3 steps right from (7, 0) if I go RIGHT now.  \nApple at (8, 1) is reachable from (6, 1) via (6, 2)\u2192(7, 2)\u2192(8, 2)\u2192(8, 1) or similar, but from (7, 0) via (8, 0)\u2192(8, 1) is shorter.  \nApple at (0, 2) is far, enemy near it.  \n\nGoing RIGHT gets me closer to (9, 0) and (8, 1) along bottom row.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nEnemy is moving away from bottom row (likely DOWN or LEFT). My body blocks me from going left much, so moving right towards apples (9, 0) and (8, 1) is good. However, UP gives more future flexibility and still allows moving right later.  \n\nGiven my body shape, if I go RIGHT to (7, 0), next turn I can go UP to (7, 1) and then towards (8, 1) apple. But going UP first to (6, 1) also lets me go RIGHT to (7, 1) next turn, same distance to (8, 1) apple, but with more options now.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Final choice**  \nBoth safe. UP gives more future safe moves and avoids being stuck on bottom row with only UP/LEFT/RIGHT next turn (DOWN off board).  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (6, 1), consider moving right toward (8, 1) apple while monitoring enemy movement.  \n\nUP",

But (1,0) to (0,0) then (0,1) then (0,2) is also possible but longer.  \n\nActually:  \nPath to (0, 2) from (1,1):  \n- LEFT (0,1) \u2192 UP (0,2) reaches apple quickly. Need to check safety later but it's an option.  \nPath to (8, 1) from (1,1): far; maybe feasible but other snake at (6,0) could contest.  \n\nAlso need to consider **future available space** after moving:  \n\n**LEFT to (0,1)** \u2014 possible next moves from there: UP(0,2) has apple but might be safe? Maybe risky if I trap myself in the corner \u2014 but UP from (0,1) to (0,2) is apple; if I eat it, tail won\u2019t move, so that\u2019s safe unless enemy cuts me off. Maybe safe. Also from (0,1) can go DOWN to (0,0) next if needed.\n\n**DOWN to (1,0)** \u2014 possible next moves from there: LEFT to (0,0) (safe), RIGHT to (2,0) NO my body. So only LEFT or DOWN from (1,0)? Actually DOWN from (1,0) is off board (y=-1) so \u274c, so actually from (1,0) only LEFT to (0,0), RIGHT\u274c, UP back to (1,1)\u2705. So two moves: LEFT or UP. Slightly more limiting.\n\nLEFT to (0,1) gives UP(0,2 with apple)\u2705, LEFT\u274coff board, RIGHT to (1,1)\u2705, DOWN to (0,0)\u2705 \u2192 3 options next turn.  \n\nSo LEFT opens more options than DOWN.  \n\n**Also apple proximity**: (0, 2) is one move away after LEFT+UP sequence; worth trying to get apples and lead since enemy is at 10, I\u2019m at 12.  \n\n**Risk of enemy collision**: Snake #0 at (6,0) possible moves: might go towards (8,1) apple or (9,0) apple. It won\u2019t reach my location next turn.\n\nSo: **LEFT** is better.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (0,1), strongly consider UP to (0,2) to eat apple if safe, else go to (0,0) or (1,1) to avoid dead ends. Keep an eye on enemy #0\u2019s progress toward apples (9,0) etc., try to block if possible.\n\nLEFT",

So RIGHT not safe.  \n\nSo from (0,2) only **UP** safe next turn\u2014dead end risk.\n\n**DOWN to (0,0):**\n\nFrom (0,0) neighbors:  \n- UP (0,1) \u2013 body segment next turn \u274c  \n- DOWN off board \u274c  \n- LEFT off board \u274c  \n- RIGHT (1,0) \u2013 empty \u2705\n\nSo from (0,0) only **RIGHT** safe next turn\u2014dead end risk but maybe less so if tail moves later.\n\nBut UP yields apple immediately, increasing score to 13.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Strategic considerations:**\n\nApples: (9,0), (9,4), (8,8), (8,1), (0,2)  \n\nEating (0,2) now gets me to 13 vs enemy\u2019s 10. That\u2019s good. But after eating it, I\u2019m temporarily cornered at (0,2) with only UP safe next turn.  \n\nFrom (0,0) future: no apple there, but maybe path to (8,1) apple later in future. But (8,1) is closer to enemy at (6,1)? (enemy head actually at (6,1)? Wait no: enemy head (6,0)! My bad: board says head #0 at (6,0) actually\u2014yes: check grid: row y=1: \u201c\u2026 0 \u2026\u201d so (6,1) is empty? No, look: row y=0: \u201c\u2026T T T T 0 . . A\u201d so enemy head at (6,0), body (5,0) etc. So enemy is at (6,0). It wants apples: Might go to (8,1) or (9,0). Not immediate threat to me.\n\nIf I take (0,2) apple, I must ensure I can escape from top-left corner later. That\u2019s possible through (0,3) etc. because board\u2019s top row is empty.  \n\nConsidering maximizing score: UP to (0,2) gives +1 apple and potentially a path upward along left edge to safety. DOWN to (0,0) wastes a turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoid head-on collision risk:**\n\nEnemy head (6,0) possible moves:  \n- UP to (6,1) \u2013 empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u274c off board\n- LEFT to (5,0) \u2013 its own body \u274c\n- RIGHT to (7,0) \u2013 empty \u2705\n\nSo enemy can go UP or RIGHT. It will likely go RIGHT towards (9,0) apple or UP for (8,1) apple? (8,1) is 2 steps away (right+up), but (9,0) is 3 steps away (right,right,down maybe not). Anyway, no collision risk for me at (0,2) or (0,0) from enemy this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Best choice:**\nUP gets apple, maintains lead. Need to plan to escape corner next turn, but one step at a time\u2014corner escape is manageable.\n\n**Final move:**\n\nUP",

New body: head (0,3), then (0,2),(0,1),(1,1), etc., tail (1,6).\n\nNext turn from (0,3):  \n- UP (0,4) \u2013 empty (.) \u2705  \n- DOWN (0,2) \u2013 my body \u274c  \n- LEFT off board \u274c  \n- RIGHT (1,3) \u2013 empty (.) \u2705? Check board: Row y=3: \u201c1 T T T T . . . . .\u201d \u2014 Wait, that \u20181\u2019 is me? No, current turn I\u2019m at (0,2), so \u20181\u2019 in row 3? Let\u2019s check carefully: current turn head is (0,2), board row y=3: \u201c. T . . T . . . . .\u201d in original grid? Actually board grid: y=3: \u201c. T . . T . . . . .\u201d so (0,3) currently empty, (1,3) has T (my tail tip? no, tail at y=6: (1,6)). Oh, actually: y=3 row in ASCII: \u201c3 . T . . T . . . . .\u201d but coordinate y=3 and x=1 has \u201cT\u201d (my body segment \u2014 check earlier: segments include (1,3) before (1,4)) \u2014 yes, body list before: head (0,1) then (1,1), (2,1),..., (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)... so (1,3) is my body.  \n\nSo from (0,3) next turn: UP (0,4) is safe, and RIGHT (1,3) is body \u2014 unsafe. So only UP is safe again?? If so, corner trap.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Checking that carefully:**\nCurrent body after last move: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), tail] \u2014 Actually tail is last segment so body length 13, hence head + 13 segments = total length 14. Yes.\n\nSo after moving to (0,3), body becomes: (0,3) head, body: [(0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)], tail (1,6) drops? Wait: I ate apple last turn so tail doesn\u2019t drop this turn. Actually: After eating apple at turn 69 (last turn), length becomes 14 segments; next move (this turn) tail stays put, body shifts one. So new body after this move:  \nhead (0,3), body[0] = (0,2), body[1] = (0,1), body[2] = (1,1), etc., up to body[12] = (1,5), tail = (1,6).\n\nSo (1,3) is in the body list? Check index: body[0]=(0,2), [1]=(0,1), [2]=(1,1), [3]=(2,1), [4]=(2,0), [5]=(3,0), [6]=(3,1), [7]=(3,2), [8]=(2,2), [9]=(1,2), [10]=(1,3), [11]=(1,4), [12]=(1,5), tail (1,6) okay. So yes, (1,3) is body[10].\n\nThus from (0,3): UP safe, RIGHT unsafe. Only 1 option.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Strategy:**\nI must go UP to (0,3) this turn because it\u2019s the only safe move. Then next turn only UP to (0,4). I am cornered along left wall until some body segment clears space by tail moving later.\n\nLong-term plan: Keep going up along left edge to top row, then move right toward apples like (8,8), avoiding enemy. But need to survive consecutive forced moves up.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Final move**\nNo choice.  \n\nUP",

Let's check: body list ends at (1,3). Wait, no: current body after last move is: [(0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)] \u2014 yes, tail is (1,2). Let's recheck carefully.\n\nHead: (0,5) (this turn after moving up from last turn)\nBody segments in order:\n1. (0,4)  (segment right behind head)\n2. (0,3)\n3. (0,2)\n4. (0,1)\n5. (1,1)\n6. (2,1)\n7. (2,0)\n8. (3,0)\n9. (3,1)\n10. (3,2)\n11. (2,2)\n12. (1,2)\n13. (1,3) \u2014 oh wait, that's wrong length. Apples collected: 13 means length = 13 segments. With head (0,5) + 12 body segments. Let's count carefully from board state.\n\nBoard state shows:\nRow5: 1 . . . . . . . . .  \u2192 head\nRow4: T . . . T . . . . A \u2192 body segment\nSo my body at (0,4) = T.\n\nBetter: Body list from snake info last turn: head (0,4) body: [(0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)].\nAfter moving UP from (0,4) to (0,5), new head (0,5), new body: old head becomes first body segment, drop tail (1,3) if no apple eaten? Wait, since I didn't eat apple, snake moves: new head at (0,5), first body segment at (0,4), each segment shifts forward, tail (1,3) disappears. So new body is: [(0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)].\n\nSo tail is now (1,2), not (1,3). Double check length: 13 segments total: head + 12 body. List length 12 body \u2014 yes matches.\n\nSo from head (0,5):\n- DOWN to (0,4) \u2192 my first body segment \u274c no.\n- UP to (0,6) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- LEFT off board \u274c\n- RIGHT to (1,5) \u2192 empty \u2705 (check board: row5 col1 is empty)\n\nAlso check enemy bodies: Snake #0 head at (7,2), body through (4,4). (1,5) clear. So SAFE.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Future mobility:**\n\n**UP to (0,6):**\nNext turn options: UP (0,7) empty, DOWN (0,5) body \u274c, LEFT off \u274c, RIGHT (1,6) empty.\n2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**RIGHT to (1,5):**\nNext turn: UP (1,6) empty, DOWN (1,4) empty? Actually (1,4) empty currently (tail was at (1,3) last turn, then became (1,4)? No, tail was (1,3), now gone, so (1,4) empty?). Let's check board row4: T at (0,4), then empty at (1,4), body T at (4,4) \u2014 that's enemy body. So (1,4) empty yes.  \nLEFT (0,5) body \u274c. RIGHT (2,5) empty \u2705. So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 3 safe moves. Better mobility.\n\nSo RIGHT has more options next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targets:**\n\nApples: (9,0) far, (9,4) far, (8,8) good target but far, (7,6) closer, (5,7) closest.  \nRight now at (0,5): moving RIGHT toward center opens path to (5,7), (7,6), (8,8).\n\nMoving UP along wall keeps me trapped on left edge longer.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy avoidance:**\n\nEnemy head (7,2) is far. No immediate collision risk. They will likely go for (7,6) or (5,7) too, so getting closer to those apples is good.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**\n\nMove right toward center, then up toward (5,7) apple. Keep space to avoid traps. With tail relatively short (13 long) and board 10x10, still room to maneuver.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Final choice:**\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, RIGHT offers more mobility and a path toward apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Eating (7, 6) now puts me at 12, closing gap.  \nAfter eating (7, 6), I can consider moving toward (8, 8) or other apples.  \nGoing LEFT or RIGHT delays apple eating, but keeps options open. However, immediate apple is beneficial for score and growth (though longer body means more risk later).  \n\nBut: eating apple now also means my body grows, so tail stays at (4, 1) for one more turn before moving. That could affect future pathing, but board is fairly open around (7, 6).\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \n(7, 6) is not a dead end; all exits open.  \n(6, 5) and (8, 5) also fine.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction**  \nEnemy at (1, 7) might go toward (5, 7) apple or (8, 8) apple.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (1, 8), then LEFT to (0, 8), etc., it\u2019s far from me.  \nI think immediate apple grab is safe.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nEat (7, 6) now, then from (7, 6) consider moving toward (8, 8) via (7, 7) or (8, 6), depending on safety. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s approach to (5, 7) or (8, 8). If enemy heads toward (8, 8), maybe I go for (9, 4) instead after eating (7, 6).\n\nUP",

No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple positions**  \nApples: (9, 0), (9, 4), (8, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7)  \n- UP (7, 8): closer to (8, 8)  \n- LEFT (6, 7): adjacent to (5, 7)  \n- RIGHT (8, 7): adjacent to (8, 8)  \n\nLEFT puts me directly next to apple (5, 7).  \nRIGHT puts me directly next to apple (8, 8).  \nUP is one step away from (8, 8).\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \n\nIf UP to (7, 8):  \nFrom (7, 8):  \nUP \u2192 (7, 9): empty  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 7): empty (old head)  \nLEFT \u2192 (6, 8): empty  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8, 8): apple  \nAll 4 safe next turn.\n\nIf LEFT to (6, 7):  \nFrom (6, 7):  \nUP \u2192 (6, 8): empty  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 6): empty  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 7): apple  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 7): empty (old head)  \nAll 4 safe next turn.\n\nIf RIGHT to (8, 7):  \nFrom (8, 7):  \nUP \u2192 (8, 8): apple  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 6): empty  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 7): empty (old head)  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 7): empty  \nAll 4 safe next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Which apple to target?**  \nEnemy at (2, 8) is 3 steps from (5, 7) if they go DOWN to (2, 7), then LEFT to (1, 7) (body), so actually blocked. Their shortest to (5, 7) is DOWN to (2, 7), then (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7) = 4 steps.  \nEnemy to (8, 8) is 6 steps away.\n\nI can get (5, 7) in 1 move if I go LEFT now.  \nI can get (8, 8) in 1 move if I go RIGHT now (then UP next turn), or 2 moves if I go UP now (then RIGHT next turn).\n\nEnemy might not reach (5, 7) before me if I go LEFT now.  \nBut (5, 7) is closer to enemy\u2019s current path if they move DOWN/RIGHT.  \n(8, 8) is safer because enemy is far and I can secure it quickly.\n\nHowever, going LEFT to (6, 7) gives me the option to eat (5, 7) next turn, and also opens path to (4, 7) apple after.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Tail movement**  \nMy tail is at (4, 0). If I eat an apple now, I grow and tail stays. If not, tail moves to (5, 0) next turn.  \nEating an apple now helps me catch up in score (enemy 13, me 12).  \nLEFT gets me adjacent to apple (5, 7) for next turn.  \nRIGHT gets me adjacent to apple (8, 8) for next turn.  \nUP doesn\u2019t get me adjacent to any apple now.\n\nBest to eat an apple as soon as possible.  \nSo between LEFT and RIGHT:  \n- LEFT: apple at (5, 7) is closer to enemy\u2019s area, but enemy\u2019s body blocks them from quick access.  \n- RIGHT: apple at (8, 8) is far from enemy and near board edge, less risky.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Choose**  \nI\u2019ll go RIGHT to (8, 7), putting me adjacent to (8, 8) apple for next turn, far from enemy, and keeping options open (can go to (9, 7) or (8, 6) after eating).\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nEat (8, 8) apple by moving UP from (8, 7). Then assess safety for moving toward (9, 4) or (4, 7) while avoiding enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

Old head (8, 7) becomes body segment 1, so (8, 7) occupied.)  \nActually:  \nCurrent body: head (8, 7), then (7, 7), (7, 6), \u2026 (6, 0), (5, 0) tail.  \nIf I move RIGHT without eating:  \nNew head (9, 7), new body: (9, 7) head, then old head (8, 7), then (7, 7), \u2026 up to (6, 0), tail (5, 0) disappears, new tail is (6, 0).  \nSo (8, 7) occupied, (5, 0) empty.  \n\nFrom (9, 7):  \n- UP (9, 8): empty  \n- DOWN (9, 6): empty  \n- LEFT (8, 7): my body \u2192 unsafe  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**If DOWN to (8, 6):**  \nFrom (8, 6) next turn:  \nOld head (8, 7) becomes body segment 1.  \n- UP (8, 7): my body \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN (8, 5): empty  \n- LEFT (7, 6): my body segment 3 currently at (7, 6) \u2192 will it move? After no eat, body shifts: segment 3 becomes (7, 5) next turn, so (7, 6) empty? Wait, check:  \nBody now: (8, 7) head, (7, 7) seg2, (7, 6) seg3, (7, 5) seg4, \u2026  \nMove DOWN to (8, 6):  \nNew body: head (8, 6), seg2 (8, 7), seg3 (7, 7), seg4 (7, 6), seg5 (7, 5)\u2026  \nSo (7, 6) is occupied by seg4 next turn.  \nThus from (8, 6):  \n- UP (8, 7) occupied by seg2 \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN (8, 5) empty  \n- LEFT (7, 6) occupied by seg4 \u2192 unsafe  \n- RIGHT (9, 6) empty  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare**  \nUP: eat apple now, tie score, 3 safe moves next turn.  \nRIGHT: no apple, 2 safe moves next turn, but puts me near edge.  \nDOWN: no apple, 2 safe moves next turn.\n\nUP is clearly best for score and future options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Check enemy path to (8, 8)**  \nEnemy at (3, 8) is 5 steps away from (8, 8) minimum. I eat it this turn, so no contest.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan after eating (8, 8)**  \nFrom (8, 8) with body: (8, 7) behind me.  \nNext turn safe moves: UP (8, 9), LEFT (7, 8), RIGHT (9, 8).  \nProbably go LEFT (7, 8) to stay central and approach (5, 7) or (4, 7) apples while keeping distance from enemy.

If enemy eats (4, 7), they\u2019ll be at (4, 7) next turn, adjacent to (5, 7).

Enemy at (4, 8) \u2192 (4, 7) eats apple, next turn from (4, 7) they could go RIGHT to (5, 7) in 1 move, so they\u2019d get there before me. So (5, 7) is likely going to enemy unless they don\u2019t take it.\n\nMaybe better to target (9, 4) apple instead, since enemy is far from it.  \nFrom (9, 8) I can go DOWN toward (9, 4).  \nFrom (7, 8) I\u2019d have to go RIGHT then DOWN, longer.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid enemy collision risk next turn**  \nEnemy possible moves: (4, 9), (4, 7), (5, 8)  \nIf I go LEFT to (7, 8), no overlap.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 8), no overlap.  \nIf I go UP to (8, 9), no overlap.\n\nAll safe this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Choose**  \nLEFT (7, 8) keeps me central with options toward multiple apples and away from enemy\u2019s immediate area.  \nRIGHT (9, 8) edges me toward (9, 4) but limits lateral movement.  \nUP (8, 9) corners me.\n\nBest for flexibility and future apple access: LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (7, 8), consider moving toward (5, 7) if enemy doesn\u2019t take it, else aim for (9, 4) via right/down path.

Board display shows A at (4,7), no snakes there now. Let's check enemy body positions: Snake #0 body is at (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), ... nothing at (4,7). So safe \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,8): snake #1\u2019s own body  \u274c unsafe  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,8): board empty \u2705  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Future mobility assessment:**\n\nUP to (4,9):  \nNext options: UP off board \u274c, DOWN body \u274c, LEFT (3,9) empty, RIGHT (5,9) empty \u2192 2 safe moves but corner.\n\nDOWN to (4,7):  \nAfter eating apple, snake grows, tail moves forward one spot \u2014 let's check: tail now at (2,1). Actually wait: our snake body currently ends at (2,1). Next turnover tail moves to (1,8)? Let me reconsider: current body: head (4,8), then (3,8), (2,8), \u2026, (1,8), then (1,7)\u2026 Actually I see (from last turn body list) the tail is (2,1) now \u2014 correction: Turn 79, last move was right, so head now (4,8). Body is [(3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]. Yes, so tomorrow tail will move forward to (1,8) because oldest segment (2,1) gone? Actually no: eating apple \u2192 tail doesn\u2019t move (snake length increases by 1 so tail stays where it is). So after eating apple at (4,7), body length increases.  \n\nNext turn mobility after eating apple at (4,7): Head at (4,7), segments: (4,8),(3,8),(2,8),..., tail still at (2,1). Then possible moves from (4,7): UP (4,8) body  \u274c, DOWN (4,6) empty, LEFT (3,7) empty, RIGHT (5,7) apple + empty. So 3 safe moves \u2014 but one leads to another apple.  \n\nRIGHT to (5,8):  \nNext turn: UP (5,9) empty, DOWN (5,7) apple empty, LEFT (4,8) body \u274c, RIGHT (6,8) empty \u2014 3 safe moves, more central & flexible.\n\nUP \u2192 corner-ish.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples: (4,7), (5,7) both close \u2014 can get both in succession possibly if I go DOWN now to (4,7), then RIGHT next to (5,7).  \nRisk: enemy head at (8,8) might move toward (9,4) or elsewhere, but not immediately threatening (4,7).  \n\nActually, enemy head at (8,8) now: possible moves: UP off board  \u274c, DOWN (8,7) body  \u274c, LEFT (7,8) empty \u2705, RIGHT off board  \u274c \u2014 so enemy only move is LEFT to (7,8). That\u2019s safe distance.\n\nSo DOWN to apple (4,7) seems safe from enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Risk of collision with enemy next turn after eating apple?**  \nAfter my move: If I go DOWN to (4,7), enemy goes LEFT to (7,8). Next turn I\u2019m at (4,7), enemy at (7,8): no collision risk. Then I can go to (5,7) safely.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare with RIGHT:**  \nRIGHT to (5,8) \u2014 then maybe next turn eat (5,7) \u2014 but enemy could take (4,7) first next turn if they go from (7,8) to (7,7),(6,7),(5,7)... No, they can\u2019t reach (4,7) in one move from (7,8). Actually they can: from (7,8) DOWN (7,7) body  \u274c, LEFT (6,8) \u2705, UP off  \u274c, RIGHT off \u274c \u2013 so their only move next turn is LEFT to (6,8) actually \u2014 wait mismatch: coordinate check: enemy head (8,8) now, next turn only move is (7,8). Then from (7,8) possible moves: UP (7,9) empty, DOWN (7,7) body \u274c, LEFT (6,8) empty, RIGHT (8,8) empty? Actually (8,8) now empty because enemy moved from (8,8) to (7,8) before. So actually from (7,8): UP (7,9) empty, DOWN (7,7) body, LEFT (6,8) empty, RIGHT (8,8) empty. So they have UP, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 could interfere later. But not immediately threatening apples at (4,7) or (5,7).\n\n---\n\nGiven proximity of apples and minimal enemy threat, best to eat apple (4,7) now to grow and keep parity with Snake #0 (both at 13 apples, they may eat (8,8)? Wait apple at (8,8) isn\u2019t listed \u2014 apples are at (9,0),(9,4),(5,7),(4,7),(3,2) maybe I misread board. Let me check: (8,8) in board display has \u20180\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s enemy head, not apple. So enemy has no adjacent apple now. Good.\n\nSo safest + apple gain: DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Final choice:**\nUP: safe but fewer options.  \nRIGHT: safe, but delays apple.  \nDOWN: safe, gets apple, keeps options open.\n\nDOWN\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

If enemy eats (5, 7), they grow to 15 apples, I stay at 13.  \n- (4, 1) is 7 steps away.  \n- (9, 4) is 5 steps away.  \n- (9, 0) far.  \n- (3, 2) far.\n\nIf enemy eats (5, 7), they\u2019ll be at (5, 7) next turn, closer to (9, 4) and (4, 1). I need to secure an apple soon.\n\nFrom (6, 8), I can go DOWN toward (6, 7) and then maybe (5, 7) if enemy doesn\u2019t take it, or go toward (9, 4) via right/down later.  \nFrom (7, 9), I\u2019m at top edge, fewer options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Safety after each safe move**  \n\n**If UP to (7, 9):**  \nNext turn body: seg2 (7, 8), seg3 (8, 8), seg4 (8, 7), \u2026 tail (6, 0).  \nFrom (7, 9):  \n- UP off board \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN (7, 8) my body \u2192 unsafe  \n- LEFT (6, 9): empty  \n- RIGHT (8, 9): empty  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn, but cornered at top.\n\n**If LEFT to (6, 8):**  \nNext turn body: seg2 (7, 8), seg3 (8, 8), seg4 (8, 7), \u2026 tail (6, 0).  \nFrom (6, 8):  \n- UP (6, 9): empty  \n- DOWN (6, 7): empty  \n- LEFT (5, 8): empty  \n- RIGHT (7, 8) my body \u2192 unsafe  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn, more flexible.\n\nLEFT gives more options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy apple threat**  \nEnemy at (4, 7) can eat (5, 7) this turn. If they do, they\u2019ll be at (5, 7) next turn, adjacent to (6, 7) and (5, 6), possibly blocking my path down.  \nIf I go LEFT to (6, 8), I\u2019m one step away from (6, 7), which is next to (5, 7) if enemy is there \u2014 risky next turn if they stay.  \nBut if enemy eats (5, 7), they grow, so their tail won\u2019t move, meaning their body occupies more space, possibly blocking me later.\n\nBetter to avoid moving into a potential trap near enemy.  \nFrom (6, 8), I can go DOWN to (6, 7) next turn only if (6, 7) is safe. If enemy is at (5, 7), (6, 7) is safe unless enemy moves into it simultaneously (head-on risk). I can check that next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI need apples. (9, 4) is far but reachable via right/down from (6, 8) in several moves. (4, 1) is also possible but near enemy body.  \nLEFT to (6, 8) keeps me central, avoids top-edge trap, and gives 3 options next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (6, 8), assess enemy position. If enemy ate (5, 7), avoid moving into (6, 7) if they might go there. Instead consider LEFT to (5, 8) or UP to (6, 9) to loop toward (9, 4) via the right side. Prioritize safety and gradual movement toward apples on right side (9, 4) or bottom (9, 0).\n\nLEFT",

Actually my options are all far from enemy reach now except maybe in 2 moves \u2014 check: their possible next locations:  \nFrom (7,8) to (7,9): then next turn they could threaten me if I move toward top right;  \nBetter avoid top area if possible.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (5,7) adjacent RIGHT \u2705 eat now.  \nAlso apples: (9,0) far away, (9,4) far, (3,2) closer but need LEFT + DOWN later, (4,1) even closer to my tail but maybe risky later.  \n\nEating (5,7) grows immediately and keeps tail far for now.  \n\nEating apple at (5,7) also increases lead (15 vs enemy 13).  \nBut: going RIGHT: next turn possible moves from (5,7) \u2014 check:  \nSegment growth means tail stays at (2,1); body blocks (5,8) and partially (4,7). Actually body = head old pos (4,7) after move? Wait: current head (4,7); moving RIGHT \u2192 new head (5,7), body first segment (4,7), then (4,8)... So available moves from (5,7) after eating apple:  \n- UP (5,8) empty (no enemy possible there next turn?) Enemy might go to (8,8) or (7,9), far enough.  \n- DOWN (5,6) empty  \n- LEFT (4,7) body \u274c  \n- RIGHT (6,7) empty  \nSo 3 safe options exist after eating apple \u2014 keeps mobility high.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 LEFT to (3, 7) analysis:**  \nFrom (3,7): next turn can go to (3,8) body \u274c, (2,7) empty, (3,6) empty \u2014 2 moves. Leads toward apple (3,2) later but slower. Possibly safer from enemy because enemy not heading there yet. But less reward.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 DOWN to (4, 6) analysis:**  \nFrom (4,6): next turn can go to (4,7) body \u274c, (4,5) empty, (3,6) empty, (5,6) empty \u2014 3 moves. Avoids enemy area but misses apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2014 Compare:**  \nRIGHT: gets apple, good mobility, slight risk of enemy heading to (6,8) then (6,7) next turn \u2014 but that\u2019s 2 turns away from collision. Enemy would have to guess I'm going RIGHT and then DOWN to (5,6) etc. \u2014 low probability.  \nLEFT/DOWN: safe but no apple.\n\nGiven equal safety, choose apple gain and maintain lead.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating (5,7), check enemy position. Possibly aim for (3,2) next by going left/down afterward, staying away from enemy head area.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT to (5, 8) is risky if enemy goes UP. DOWN to (6, 7) is risky if enemy goes RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Assess collision probabilities**  \nEnemy might prioritize apples: closest apple is (9, 4) from them, but (4, 1) is closer? Let\u2019s check distances:  \nEnemy at (5, 7) to (9, 4): 7 steps.  \nEnemy to (4, 1): 7 steps.  \nEnemy to (3, 2): 6 steps.  \nEnemy to (9, 0): 9 steps.  \n\nThey might go toward (3, 2) via DOWN/LEFT. That suggests DOWN to (5, 6) or RIGHT to (6, 7) (if they want to go down later).  \nIf they go RIGHT to (6, 7), then my DOWN is deadly. If they go DOWN to (5, 6), then my DOWN is safe.  \n\nBut I can\u2019t know. Safest is to avoid overlapping possible enemy destinations.  \n\nFrom my safe moves:  \n- UP (6, 9): enemy can\u2019t reach it this turn \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n- DOWN (6, 7): enemy can reach it \u2192 risky.  \n- LEFT (5, 8): enemy can reach it \u2192 risky.  \n\nThus only UP guarantees no head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after UP**  \nFrom (6, 9):  \n- UP off board \u2192 no  \n- DOWN (6, 8) my body \u2192 no  \n- LEFT (5, 9): empty  \n- RIGHT (7, 9): empty  \n\nSo next turn I\u2019d have 2 safe moves. That\u2019s limited but okay for one turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nFrom (6, 9), I can go LEFT to (5, 9) then down toward (9, 4) or (9, 0) later.  \nEnemy is far from those apples for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nAvoid head-on risk this turn. UP is only certain safe move. Next turn, get off top edge quickly to regain options. Aim for (9, 4) via right/down path after moving left along top row.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Wait: body after move: head (5, 6), then (5, 7), (4, 7), \u2026 UP to (5, 7) is body \u274c, so 3 safe moves. Good.  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 8): next turn options: LEFT (4, 8) body \u274c, RIGHT (6, 8) maybe enemy head? Actually enemy might move away, but risky, DOWN (5, 7) body \u274c, UP (5, 9) empty \u2192 only 1 safe move? Actually check: from (5, 8), body: (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), \u2026 so LEFT (4, 8) body \u274c, RIGHT (6, 8) possibly safe if enemy moves, but if enemy stays there, collision? Better avoid. So UP risky.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 7): next turn options: UP (6, 8) possibly enemy head, DOWN (6, 6) empty, LEFT (5, 7) body \u274c, RIGHT (7, 7) body of enemy? Actually enemy body at (7, 7) currently, but enemy moves so maybe empty next turn? Too uncertain. Also collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Avoid head-on collision:**  \nEnemy could go DOWN to (6, 7) or LEFT to (5, 8). So my RIGHT and UP are dangerous.  \nThus safest is DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2014 Long-term plan:**  \nAfter DOWN to (5, 6), next turn aim for (4, 1) or (3, 2) via LEFT/DOWN moves, staying clear of enemy path. Keep lead (15 vs 13), avoid unnecessary risks.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Then start moving down carefully toward apple (3,2) or (4,1). Avoid (0,7) because enemy\u2019s tail is near there. Keep checking enemy\u2019s possible moves to avoid head-on collisions.  \n\nLEFT",

After that, consider moving right along row 7 toward (4, 1) or (9, 4) depending on enemy position. Avoid getting trapped in top-left corner after eating (0, 7) \u2014 keep option to go RIGHT into (1, 7) if safe.  \n\nLEFT",

Apple targeting**  \nApples: (9,0), (9,4), (4,1), (0,7), (5,4)  \n\nFrom (4,2):  \n- DOWN: onto apple (4,1) \u2705 immediate apple  \n- UP: (4,3) \u2192 doesn't eat apple now but could later  \n- RIGHT: (5,2) \u2192 toward (5,4)  \n\nBest short-term apple is DOWN.\n\n**3. Enemy threat**  \nEnemy head at (0,8), body: [(0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6)]  \nTheir moves from (0,8):  \n- UP off-board \u274c  \n- DOWN (0,7) apple \u2705 safe  \n- LEFT off-board \u274c  \n- RIGHT (1,8) empty \u2705 safe  \n\nSo enemy likely goes DOWN or RIGHT.  \nDown direction puts them on (0,7) apple but far from me.  \nDistance is large, so minimal head-on risk.\n\n**4. Future mobility after move**  \n- DOWN (4,1): eaten apple, grow. Next possible moves: UP(4,2)=body \u274c, DOWN (4,0) empty \u2705, LEFT (3,1) empty \u2705, RIGHT (5,1) empty \u2705 \u2192 3 moves next turn.  \n- UP (4,3): body behind head in (4,2)? Yes, but only one segment behind so likely the neck moves away next turn. But careful: positions after my move: head (4,3), body segments: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)..., tail (1,5). Immediate danger: after moving UP, can I backtrack? Check next turn possible moves from (4,3): UP (4,4) empty \u2705, DOWN (4,2) body \u274c, LEFT (3,3) body \u274c, RIGHT (5,3) empty \u2705 \u2192 actually 2 safe moves, not great.  \n- RIGHT (5,2): next moves: UP (5,3) empty \u2705, DOWN (5,1) empty \u2705, LEFT (4,2) body \u274c, RIGHT (6,2) empty \u2705 \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nSo best mobility after DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**5. Dead ends / space**  \nCurrently my body occupies much of the left side, so moving DOWN gets apple and opens space in bottom rows; moving UP constricts me more. Right side is quite open; enemy occupies top area.\n\n**6. Long-term plan**  \nEating apple at (4,1) is nearest, increases score (16\u219217), stays farther from enemy. Then push toward (5,4) and (9,4) while keeping tail path available for maneuvering.\n\nGiven I'm safe DOWN (apple), RIGHT (safe but no immediate apple but good space), UP (less safe future), DOWN wins for short-term gain.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nEat (4,1) now, next turn options from (4,1): likely go DOWN to (4,0) or RIGHT to (5,1) to approach (5,4) apple. Avoid going back UP immediately into body.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s analyze the current state.  \n\n**Step 1 \u2013 My head and possible moves**  \nMy head: (0, 8)  \nBody: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6)]  \n\nFrom (0, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 9) \u2192 my own body \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 apple (A) \u2192 safe (eating apple means I grow, tail stays)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 8) \u2192 off board \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 currently enemy body at (1, 8), but enemy moves this turn. Could be vacated or could become enemy head if enemy moves there.  \n\nSo immediately safe moves: DOWN only. RIGHT is unsafe now because (1, 8) is occupied by enemy body at start of turn.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy snake #1 possible moves from (4, 2)**  \nEnemy head: (4, 2), body: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)]  \n\nFrom (4, 2):  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 empty (.)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 apple (A)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 its own body \u2192 unsafe  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 empty (.)  \n\nEnemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (4, 1), it eats apple (4, 1) and grows.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 2), it moves toward apple (5, 4).  \nIf enemy goes UP to (4, 3), neutral.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Will enemy move into (1, 8) or (0, 7) this turn?**  \nEnemy is at (4, 2), far from (0, 7) and (1, 8). (1, 8) is enemy\u2019s own body currently, so enemy can\u2019t move there (it\u2019s occupied at start of turn). So (1, 8) will be vacated after enemy moves (unless tail doesn\u2019t move, but enemy is long, tail moves if not eating apple). Enemy ate apple last turn? Not sure, but body length 16, apples 16, so it grew last turn maybe, so tail stays. Actually: enemy length = body length = 16 segments (head + 15 body), apples = 16, so it grew last turn, so tail stays same. That means (1, 5) is tail and stays, so (1, 8) will remain occupied unless enemy moves in a way that shifts body? Wait, if enemy moves, all segments shift forward, so (1, 8) will be replaced by (1, 7) moving into it? Let\u2019s check: enemy body list: head (4, 2), then (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5).  \n\nIf enemy moves UP to (4, 3), new head (4, 3), old head (4, 2) becomes new second segment, so body shifts: (3, 2) becomes third segment, etc. The last segment (1, 5) stays if no apple eaten. So (1, 8) will become (1, 7) from previous segment? Let\u2019s trace: current segment 14th (index from head=1) is (1, 8). After move, segment 14th will be old segment 13th: (2, 8). So (1, 8) will be vacated. Yes.  \n\nSo (1, 8) will be empty after enemy moves unless enemy eats apple and tail extends, but then (1, 8) still vacated because tail extends at old tail position.  \n\nThus (1, 8) will be empty at start of next turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Safety of DOWN to (0, 7)**  \n(0, 7) is apple. Could enemy head move into (0, 7) this turn? From (4, 2), impossible in one move. So safe.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Next turn from (0, 7)**  \nFrom (0, 7) after eating apple:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 8) \u2192 my old head position, will be empty after I move? Wait, I move from (0, 8) to (0, 7), so (0, 8) will be my neck (old head), but my body shifts: my old second segment (0, 9) moves to (0, 8). So (0, 8) will be my body next turn \u2192 unsafe to go back up immediately.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 6) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 currently enemy body at (1, 7), but enemy moves this turn. After enemy moves, (1, 7) could be vacated (see earlier trace: (1, 7) becomes (1, 6) if no apple eaten).  \n\nSo from (0, 7) next turn, possible safe moves: DOWN to (0, 6) or maybe RIGHT to (1, 7) if vacated.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEat apple (0, 7) now. Then next turn go DOWN to (0, 6) to avoid risk, then consider moving right toward center/apples. Enemy is ahead in apples (16 vs my 14 after this apple), so need to catch up but safely.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Check immediate move**  \nOnly safe move now is DOWN to (0, 7).  \n\nDOWN",

If enemy moves without eating apple, body shifts: (1, 7) becomes (1, 6), (1, 6) becomes (1, 5), tail stays at (1, 5) (old tail). So (1, 7) will be vacated unless enemy eats apple and extends tail at (1, 5) \u2014 but then (1, 7) still vacated because the segment that was at (1, 7) moves to (1, 6).

No.  \n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT are safe this turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options**  \nFrom (0, 6) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 my old head, will be my body (0, 8 moves to 0, 7) \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 currently enemy body at (1, 6), but after enemy moves, (1, 6) becomes enemy tail or vacated? Let\u2019s check: if enemy doesn\u2019t eat apple, (1, 6) becomes (1, 5) (tail stays), so (1, 6) vacated. So RIGHT from (0, 6) next turn could be safe.  \n\nFrom (1, 7) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 empty (enemy vacated it)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 likely empty (as above)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 my body (unsafe)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 empty  \n\nSo (1, 7) gives more options next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) vs (0, 6) gives only DOWN and maybe RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apples**  \nApples at: (9,0), (9,4), (5,4), (0,4), (2,3)  \nFrom (1, 7), apple (2, 3) is closer in Manhattan distance (|1-2|+|7-3|=5) than from (0, 6) to (0, 4) distance 2, but (0, 4) is straight down from (0, 6) \u2014 but I\u2019d have to pass through (0, 5) first.  \n\nActually, from (0, 6): DOWN to (0, 5), then DOWN to (0, 4) eats apple. That\u2019s safe if path clear.  \n\nFrom (1, 7): DOWN to (1, 6), DOWN to (1, 5), LEFT to (0, 5), DOWN to (0, 4) \u2014 longer.  \n\nBut enemy is at (4, 1) and might go for (5, 4) or (0, 4) soon.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk of trapping**  \nMy body occupies left column (0, 8), (0, 9) and top row. Moving RIGHT opens space, moving DOWN keeps me near left edge with fewer options.  \n\nGiven enemy is longer and ahead in apples, I should prioritize safety and keeping options open.  \n\nRIGHT to (1, 7) seems better for future mobility.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (1, 7), consider moving DOWN/UP/RIGHT to stay flexible, aim for apple (2, 3) or (5, 4) while avoiding enemy\u2019s likely path toward (5, 4).  \n\nRIGHT",
