However, the enemy might also move other directions.  \n- Apples nearby: (6,9) is directly UP from your position (two steps away), but moving UP now to (6,8) is safe (no obstacles).  \n- Board safety: Check all directions:  \n  - UP (6,8): empty, safe.  \n  - DOWN (6,6): empty, safe.  \n  - LEFT (5,7): empty, but risk of collision with enemy if it moves DOWN (to (5,7)) simultaneously.  \n  - RIGHT (7,7): empty, safe.  \n- Strategy: Prefer moves that avoid the enemy and head toward apples. Moving UP toward (6,9) apple seems good, but first step to (6,8) is safe and positions you closer. LEFT is risky due to proximity to enemy head. RIGHT and DOWN are safe but lead away from immediate apples.  \n- Decision: Move UP to (6,8) to approach apple at (6,9) while staying clear of enemy.\n\nUP",

Prioritize moves that do not trap you against walls or bodies, and avoid direct confrontations where possible. Aim to build length while staying flexible for future apple routes. Avoid the right side where the enemy snake #0 is currently active, and work toward the dense apple clusters on the left side of the board.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**Turn Analysis:**\n\n1. **My Current State:** Head at (6, 8), body is empty (length 1). Apples: 0.\n2. **Enemy State:** Snake #0 has head at (4, 8) and body at (5, 8). It has 1 apple.\n3. **Board Constraints:** 10x10 board. Walls are at x=0/9 and y=0/9.\n4. **Immediate Threats & Safety Check:**\n    - **UP (6, 9):** This is the apple at (6, 9). Moving here is valid. However, I must check if the enemy snake can collide with me. The enemy is at (4, 8). If the enemy moves RIGHT (to (5, 8)) or UP (to (4, 9)), it will not land on (6, 9). It could theoretically move twice in one turn to hit me, but snakes only move one cell per turn. Therefore, (6, 9) is physically safe from the enemy's current position for this single turn.\n    - **DOWN (6, 7):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **LEFT (5, 8):** This cell is currently occupied by the enemy snake's body. If I move here, I will die immediately (moving into another snake's body).\n    - **RIGHT (7, 8):** Empty. Safe.\n\n5. **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    - **Avoiding Collision:** I must avoid LEFT. I also need to consider if the enemy will move into my path. The enemy is at (4, 8). I am at (6, 8). We are separated by one cell (5, 8). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 8), it lands on its own body (current body location)? No, the body part at (5, 8) will move. Let's trace the enemy's potential move.\n        - Enemy Head: (4, 8). Body: [(5, 8)].\n        - If Enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 8): The body segment at (5, 8) will move to (4, 8). This is a valid move. The enemy head moves to (5, 8). This puts the enemy head directly to my LEFT.\n        - If I move UP to (6, 9), I am safe.\n        - If I move DOWN to (6, 7), I am safe.\n        - If I move RIGHT to (7, 8), I am safe.\n        - If I move LEFT to (5, 8), I die (collision with body) AND if the enemy moves RIGHT, we die (head-on collision).\n\n    - **Apple Acquisition:** The apple at (6, 9) is directly UP. Taking it increases my score to 1 and gives me a body length of 2. This is the most immediate objective.\n    - **Positioning:** The left side of the board (x=0-2) is dense with apples: (0,9), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,2), (2,4), (2,8), (2,9). Moving UP (to 6,9) or RIGHT (to 7,8) moves me away from these apples. Moving DOWN (to 6,7) keeps me relatively central but doesn't gain an apple.\n    - **Enemy Interaction:** The enemy snake #0 is to my left at (4,8). It has 1 apple. It is likely hunting apples to its left as well (e.g., (1,7), (2,8)). The right side of the board (x=7-9) is relatively empty of apples, except (8,3), (9,5), (8,2). I should probably move UP to grab the apple at (6,9) and then turn left/toward the apple cluster on the left side in subsequent turns.\n\n6. **Decision:**\n    - **UP to (6, 9)** is the best move. It secures an apple immediately. It is safe from walls. It is safe from the enemy's immediate reach (cannot reach (6,9) in one move). It does not trap me.\n    - **DOWN to (6, 7)** is safe but misses the apple.\n    - **RIGHT to (7, 8)** is safe but moves me away from the dense apple cluster on the left.\n    - **LEFT to (5, 8)** is death (body collision).\n\n    Therefore, UP is the optimal move.\n\nUP",

I need to be careful not to get cut off by the enemy snake.\nEND LONG-TERM PLAN\n\nSTART LAST RATIONALE\nMy current head is at (6, 9). The board coordinates indicate y=9 is the top row and y=0 is the bottom. My head is at the top edge of the board (y=9).\nI need to check potential moves:\n- UP (6, 10): Invalid (wall).\n- DOWN (6, 8): Currently empty (my previous tail was at (6, 8) but I moved to (6, 9), so (6, 8) is now empty).\n- LEFT (5, 9): Currently empty (based on board state: \"A . . 1 . . . 1 . . .\" wait, checking the visual. Row 9: `9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`. The head '1' is at index 6. Index 5 is '.'.\n- RIGHT (7, 9): Currently empty (index 7 is '.').\n\nI should avoid moving UP into the wall.\nI want to move toward the left-side apple clusters. Moving DOWN or LEFT puts me closer to those apples. Moving RIGHT moves me away.\nMoving LEFT to (5, 9) is a safe move that progresses toward the left side. Moving DOWN to (6, 8) is also safe but moves me slightly downward.\nMoving LEFT keeps me on the top row, potentially allowing me to access apples at (2, 9) or (2, 8) later.\nLet's verify board state for (5, 9): Row 9 visual: `9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`. The spaces correspond to indices 0 through 9.\nIndex 0: A\nIndex 1: .\nIndex 2: A\nIndex 3: .\nIndex 4: .\nIndex 5: .\nIndex 6: 1 (My head)\nIndex 7: .\nIndex 8: .\nIndex 9: .\nSo (5, 9) is empty. Safe.\nLet's verify board state for (6, 8): Row 8 visual: `8 . . A 0 T . T . . .`\nWait, the 'T' usually denotes tail. My previous body was at (6, 8). I am now at (6, 9). So (6, 8) should be empty. The board shows `.` at index 6. Safe.\nMoving LEFT seems best to get closer to the left side apples.\nEND LAST RATIONALE\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake #0 is currently moving towards (2, 8), likely to eat the apples there. I am at (5, 9) and my body is at (6, 9). I need to avoid trapping myself. Moving to (4, 9) or (5, 8) are options. (5, 8) is currently empty, but (6, 8) is an apple. If I move DOWN to (5, 8), I open up the path to (6, 8). However, the enemy is at (2, 8) and might move down. I should aim to eat the apple at (6, 8) on the next turn if safe.\nEND LONG-TERM PLAN\n\nSTART RATIONALE\nI am at (5, 9). My body is at (6, 9).\nPotential moves:\n1.  **UP (5, 10)**: Invalid (wall).\n2.  **DOWN (5, 8)**: Currently empty ('.' in row 8, index 5). This is a safe move.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 9)**: Currently empty ('.' in row 9, index 4). This is a safe move.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 9)**: This is my own body (tail). Moving here is suicide.\n\nI need to decide between DOWN and LEFT.\n-   **Moving LEFT to (4, 9)**:\n    -   Pros: Moves me horizontally towards the left-side apple clusters. Keeps me on the top row where there is space.\n    -   Cons: I would miss the apple at (6, 8) for this turn. My body would be at (5, 9), leaving (6, 9) empty.\n-   **Moving DOWN to (5, 8)**:\n    -   Pros: Moves me toward the apple at (6, 8) (which I can potentially eat next turn). It also moves me out of the top row corner slightly.\n    -   Cons: Moving down brings me closer to the enemy snake #0 at (2, 8). However, the distance is still significant (3 cells away).\n\nLet's look at the board state for row 8:\nRow 8: `8 . . A 0 T . T . . .`\nIndices: 0: ., 1: ., 2: A, 3: 0 (Enemy Head), 4: T (Enemy Body), 5: . (Target), 6: T (Enemy Body), 7: ., 8: ., 9: .\n\nWait, checking the provided board state carefully:\n`9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`\n`8 . . 0 T T . . . . .`\nThe visual alignment is a bit tricky, but the coordinates given in the text are authoritative.\nEnemy #0 is at (2, 8). My move to (5, 8) puts me at x=5, y=8.\nThe enemy is at x=2, y=8. They are 3 units away horizontally.\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 8), I am safe this turn.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT (to 3, 8), they are still 2 units away.\nIf the enemy moves UP, they move away.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, they move away.\n\nIs there any immediate threat?\nMy body is at (6, 9).\nMoving to (5, 8) is safe.\nMoving to (4, 9) is safe.\n\nHowever, looking at the apples on row 8? There is an apple at (6, 3), (8, 2), etc. The immediate apple visible is at (6, 8)? No, looking at the apple list:\n`(6, 3)` is an apple.\n`(8, 2)` is an apple.\n`(2, 9)` is an apple.\n`(0, 9)` is an apple.\n\nWait, let's re-verify the board state for row 8. The text says:\n`8 . . 0 T T . . . . .`\nIf indices align:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: .\n3: 0 (Enemy Head)\n4: T (Body)\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: .\n9: .\n\nWait, the prompt says: `8 . . 0 T T . . . . .`\nLet's map this to coordinates (0 to 9).\nIndex 0: '.'\nIndex 1: '.'\nIndex 2: '0' (This is the enemy head at (2, 8))\nIndex 3: 'T' (Body at (3, 8))\nIndex 4: 'T' (Body at (4, 8))\nIndex 5: '.'\nIndex 6: '.'\nIndex 7: '.'\nIndex 8: '.'\nIndex 9: '.'\n\nSo (5, 8) is empty. (6, 8) is empty.\nWait, is there an apple at (6, 8)? The apple list does not contain (6, 8).\nApples at: `(6, 3)`... `(8, 2)`...\nSo (6, 8) is empty space.\n\nLet's reconsider the board state.\nRow 9: `9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`\nIndices: 0:A, 1:., 2:A, 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:1 (Me), 7:., 8:., 9:.\nMy head is at (6, 9).\nMy body is at (6, 9)? No, the snake data says:\nHead: (5, 9)\nBody: [(6, 9)]\n\nWait, the prompt says:\n**My snake (ID: 1):**\n  - **Head: (5, 9)**\n  - **Body: [(6, 9)]**\n  - **Apples collected: 1**\n\nBut the board state says:\n`9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`\nThis implies the head is at index 6 (x=6).\nThere is a contradiction between the text description and the ASCII map.\nHowever, the text explicitly states coordinates. The text says:\n**Head: (5, 9)**\n**Body: [(6, 9)]**\n\nLet's check the ASCII map again.\n`9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nx=0: A\nx=1: .\nx=2: A\nx=3: .\nx=4: .\nx=5: .\nx=6: 1\nx=7: .\nx=8: .\nx=9: .\n\nAccording to the map, the head is at (6, 9).\nAccording to the text, the head is at (5, 9).\n\nLet's check the enemy snake on the map vs text.\nText:\nEnemy #0 - Head: (2, 8), Body: [(3, 8), (4, 8)]\nMap:\n`8 . . 0 T T . . . . .`\nIndices: 0:., 1:., 2:0, 3:T, 4:T...\nThis matches the text perfectly. (2, 8) is index 2.\n\nWhy does my snake appear at index 6 on the map if my head is (5, 9)?\nPerhaps I miscounted the spaces in the map row 9.\n`9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`\nLet's count the characters between 'A' and '1'.\nA (0)\n. (1)\nA (2)\n. (3)\n. (4)\n. (5)\n1 (6)\nYes, the map shows the head at x=6.\n\nIs it possible the map is the *result* of the previous move, and the text description is the *current state*?\nNo, the text says \"Head: (5, 9)\".\nLet's look at the \"Your last move information\".\n\"My current head is at (6, 9).\" (This was in the last rationale).\n\"LEFT\" was the move chosen.\nIf I was at (6, 9) and moved LEFT, I would be at (5, 9).\nSo the current head SHOULD be at (5, 9).\n\nWhy does the map show '1' at x=6?\nMaybe the map is slightly misaligned or I am misinterpreting the map row 9 string.\n`9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`\nIf the head is at (5, 9), index 5 should be '1'.\nLet's look at the characters again.\nCharacter 0: 'A'\nCharacter 1: ' '\nCharacter 2: '.'\nCharacter 3: ' '\nCharacter 4: 'A'\nCharacter 5: ' '\nCharacter 6: '.'\nCharacter 7: ' '\nCharacter 8: '.'\nCharacter 9: ' '\nCharacter 10: '1'\n...\nIt's a visual representation. Let's count the dots.\n`9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`\nSpaces are separators. Let's assume strict indexing 0-9 based on the visual arrangement provided.\n0: A\n1: .\n2: A\n3: .\n4: .\n5: .\n6: 1\n7: .\n8: .\n9: .\n\nIf the text says Head (5,9), and the map shows 1 at (6,9), I must trust the text state provided as the ground truth for the current turn, as the map might be a rendering artifact or I am misreading the visual spacing.\nHowever, usually, the map is the definitive visual state.\nLet's look at the enemy map again: `8 . . 0 T T . . . . .`\nIf I count spaces: `.` `.` `0` `T` `T` ...\nIndex 0: .\nIndex 1: .\nIndex 2: 0 (Matches text (2,8))\nIndex 3: T (Matches text (3,8))\nIndex 4: T (Matches text (4,8))\n\nLet's look at row 9 again: `9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`\nIndex 0: A\nIndex 1: .\nIndex 2: A\nIndex 3: .\nIndex 4: .\nIndex 5: .\nIndex 6: 1\n\nIf the text says I am at (5,9), then I am at index 5.\nIf the map shows '1' at index 6, there is a discrepancy.\nBUT, if I look at the \"Last Move Rationale\", it says:\n\"Index 6 is 1 (My head)\".\nAnd then it chose LEFT.\nIf I was at index 6, LEFT goes to index 5.\nSo currently, I should be at index 5.\n\nWhy does the map show index 6?\nMaybe the map provided is from *before* the move?\nNo, the prompt says \"Turn: 3 / 150\" and provides the current state.\nIf the map shows '1' at x=6, and text says x=5, I should double check the coordinates.\nMaybe the map is 1-indexed? No, the rules say 0,0 is bottom left.\nMaybe the map row 9 has a typo in spacing?\n`9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`\nLet's assume the text coordinates are correct and the map is a visual approximation or I am misparsing the visual string.\n**Decision:** I will trust the text coordinates (Head: 5, 9) because the last move was LEFT from 6,9, which is consistent with the text.\n\nLet's proceed with **Head (5, 9)**.\nCurrent Head: (5, 9)\nCurrent Body: (6, 9)\n\nAvailable moves:\n1.  **UP (5, 10)**: Invalid (Wall).\n2.  **DOWN (5, 8)**:\n    -   Check enemy at (2, 8). Distance 3. Safe.\n    -   Check body at (6, 9). Not blocking.\n    -   Check board map for (5, 8): Row 8 is `8 . . 0 T T . . . . .`\n    -   Index 5 corresponds to the character after `T T`. The string is `. . 0 T T . . . . .`\n    -   Indices: 0:., 1:., 2:0, 3:T, 4:T, 5:.\n    -   So (5, 8) is empty.\n    -   Result: Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 9)**:\n    -   Check body at (6, 9). Not blocking.\n    -   Check board map for (4, 9): Row 9 `9 A . A . . . 1 . . .`\n    -   Indices: 0:A, 1:., 2:A, 3:., 4:.\n    -   So (4, 9) is empty.\n    -   Result: Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 9)**:\n    -   This is my body (tail).\n    -   Result: Suicide.\n\nSo I can go DOWN or LEFT.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 8):\n- I am at (5, 8). Body is (5, 9), (6, 9).\n- I am getting closer to the center of the board.\n- There is an apple at (6, 3) which is straight down from here (if I keep going down).\n- There is an apple at (8, 2) to the right.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 9):\n- I am at (4, 9). Body is (5, 9), (6, 9).\n- I am moving towards the left edge.\n- Apples on the left: (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 9).\n- (2, 9) is an apple. If I go LEFT to (4, 9), I am 2 steps away from (2, 9).\n\nWhich is better?\nThe enemy is at (2, 8). They are very close to (2, 9).\nIf I race for (2, 9), I might collide with the enemy.\nDistance for me (from 5,9) to (2,9): 3 moves.\nDistance for enemy (from 2,8) to (2,9): 1 move (UP).\nThe enemy will likely eat (2, 9) on their next turn if they move UP.\nSo (2, 9) is likely gone soon.\n\nWhat about (0, 9)? Also an apple on the top row.\nDistance for me: 5 moves.\nDistance for enemy (from 2,8) to (0,9): approx 3 moves (LEFT, LEFT, UP).\nThe enemy is much closer to the top-left apples than I am.\n\nSo moving LEFT towards the top-left cluster puts me in a direct race against the enemy who is already there. This is dangerous. If I head towards them, I might end up in a confrontation or blocked off.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN?\nThis moves me towards the center. The center has apples at (4, 6), (5, 4), (4, 1), (6, 3), (8, 2).\nThe enemy is currently at (2, 8) or moving there. The enemy is on the left side.\nIf I move DOWN, I go to the center/right side.\nThe enemy is occupied on the left.\nThis seems safer and allows me to eat apples without immediate confrontation.\n\nLet's verify the apple at (6, 8).\nThe map shows `8 . . 0 T T . . . . .`\nIs there an apple at (6, 8)?\nLooking at the apple list:\n`(0, 2), (0, 9), (8, 3), (1, 7), (4, 6), (3, 4), (6, 3), (2, 4), (2, 9), (9, 5), (8, 2), (0, 7), (0, 6), (5, 4), (4, 1)`\nNo apple at (6, 8). The map shows '.' at index 6 of row 8.\nSo (6, 8) is empty space.\nHowever, the apple at (6, 3) is straight down.\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 8), I can then move DOWN to (5, 7), etc.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (8, 2). That is in the bottom right.\nIf I move DOWN now, I open up the possibility to go RIGHT later towards (8, 2) and (9, 5).\nThe enemy is on the far left (x=2). They cannot reach the right side quickly.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN seems strategically superior to avoid the enemy and secure the center/right apples.\n\nIs there any trap in moving DOWN?\nMy body is at (6, 9). I am at (5, 9).\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 8), my body follows to (5, 9).\nIf I then move LEFT to (4, 8), my body is at (5, 8).\nIf I then move DOWN to (4, 7), etc.\nIt's an open area.\n\nLet's consider the enemy's potential move.\nEnemy at (2, 8).\nAvailable moves for enemy:\n- UP (2, 9): Empty (but apple there). Likely move to eat.\n- DOWN (2, 7): Empty?\n- LEFT (1, 8): Empty?\n- RIGHT (3, 8): Own body (tail is at 4, 8, body at 3, 8? No, body is [(3,8), (4,8)]. So (3,8) is body. So RIGHT is suicide.\n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nIf enemy goes UP to (2, 9), they eat an apple and grow.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 8), I am safe.\n\nIs there any reason to go LEFT?\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 9), I am at (4, 9).\nEnemy is at (2, 8).\nIf enemy goes UP (2, 9), they are at (2, 9). I am at (4, 9).\nWe are on the same row, 2 cells apart.\nNext turn, I could go LEFT to (3, 9), they could go RIGHT to (3, 9). Head-on collision.\nOr I could go DOWN to (4, 8). They could go UP... no.\nIf I go LEFT, I enter the enemy's territory. This is risky.\nIf I go DOWN, I enter the open center.\n\nLet's verify the board state for (5, 8) again.\nMap: `8 . . 0 T T . . . . .`\nIndices: 0:., 1:., 2:0, 3:T, 4:T, 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:.\n(5, 8) is empty.\nIs there an apple at (5, 8)? No.\nSo I just move there to position myself.\n\nWait, I missed an apple in the list: `(5, 4)`.\nIf I go DOWN now, I am moving closer to (5, 4).\n`(4, 6)` is also nearby.\nThis is a rich cluster.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the apple at (2, 9) and (0, 9).\nThe enemy is at (2, 8). They are very close.\nIf I try to contest those apples, I have to move through (4,9) -> (3,9) -> (2,9).\nThe enemy can simply go (2,8) -> (2,9).\nI would arrive one turn later or collide.\nIf I arrive later, the apple is gone.\nIf I collide, I die.\nSo the top-left apples are effectively controlled by the enemy right now.\n\nWhat about the apples on the left side lower down? (1,7), (0,7), (0,6).\nThe enemy is at (2,8). They can easily sweep down there too.\nMy starting position (5,9) is central/right.\nI should play to my position. The center and right side are mine for the taking.\n\nSo, the plan is:\nTurn 3: Move DOWN to (5, 8).\nTurn 4: Move DOWN to (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (6, 8).\nWait, if I move DOWN to (5, 8), my tail moves to (5, 9).\nIf I then move RIGHT to (6, 8), my body is (5, 8), (5, 9).\n(6, 8) is empty.\nBut (6, 3) is an apple. I need to go down to get it.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (8, 2). That is very far right.\nThe enemy is far left.\nI have time to sweep the center and then the right.\n\nIs there any immediate danger from (5, 8)?\nNo.\nIs there any danger from (4, 9)?\nOnly from the enemy approaching from the left.\nSince the enemy is likely going UP to (2,9) or DOWN to (2,7), they are moving away from x=4.\nActually, if they go DOWN, they are moving towards y=7. I am at y=8/9.\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving towards y=7.\nWe might meet in the middle (x=2 vs x=5).\nThis is fine. I have the width of the board between us.\n\nLet's double check the \"Backwards\" rule.\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nMy head is at (5, 9). My body is at (6, 9).\nThe cell directly behind my head (relative to my body) is (6, 9).\nI am not moving to (6, 9).\nI am considering (5, 8) or (4, 9).\nNeither is (6, 9).\nSo backwards rule doesn't trigger here.\n\nFinal check on (5, 8) safety.\n(5, 8) is empty.\nEnemy is at (2, 8). Distance 3.\nEnemy cannot reach (5, 8) in one turn.\nSo (5, 8) is safe.\n\nFinal check on (4, 9) safety.\n(4, 9) is empty.\nEnemy is at (2, 8). Distance approx 2.5.\nSafe.\n\nWhy choose DOWN over LEFT?\nLEFT commits me to the top edge. I will be pinned against the wall if the enemy moves to block or if I run out of apples.\nDOWN opens up the entire board (y=0 to y=8).\nDOWN leads to the apple cluster at (5, 4), (4, 6).\nDOWN leads to the right side apples (8, 2), (9, 5).\nDOWN avoids the enemy who is on the left.\n\nSo DOWN is the best move.\n\nOne detail: The apple at (2, 9) is very tempting and close-ish.\nBut the enemy is literally at (2, 8).\nIf I move LEFT, I am betting the enemy won't eat (2, 9).\nIf the enemy eats (2, 9), they grow.\nIf I move LEFT, I am approaching a growing snake.\nIf I move DOWN, I let them have it and go get my own food elsewhere.\nThis is the safer, smarter play.\n\nLet's confirm the coordinates for DOWN.\nCurrent: (5, 9)\nTarget: (5, 8)\nValid: Yes.\n\nLet's confirm the coordinates for LEFT.\nCurrent: (5, 9)\nTarget: (4, 9)\nValid: Yes.\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\nI will provide the rationale.\nEND RATIONALE\n\nDOWN",

I am currently at y=7, so the enemy body at y=8 is above me. My previous move was DOWN from (5, 9) to (5, 8), but since my body is now at (5, 8), that implies my previous turn was actually turning RIGHT from (4, 9) or UP from (5, 6)? No, looking at the coordinates in the last move info: The user says \"My current head is at (5, 9) and my body is at (6, 9).\" and then chose DOWN to (5, 8). The current board state shows my head at (5, 7) and body at (5, 8).\nThis implies the turn order was:\nTurn 4 (Last turn): I was at (5, 9), body [(6, 9)]. I moved DOWN to (5, 8). My body moved to (5, 9).\nTurn 5 (Current turn): I am at (5, 7), body [(5, 8)].\nWait, if I moved DOWN from (5, 9) to (5, 8), and my body was [(6, 9)], then my new body should be [(5, 9), (6, 9)]? No, that would be length 3.\nThe current board state shows:\nRow 7: `A A . . . 1 . . . .` (Head at x=5, y=7)\nRow 8: `. . T T T T . . . .` (Body at x=5, y=8)\nMy body is only 1 segment long (plus head), so total length 2.\nSo my body moved from (6, 9) to (5, 8)? No, that's not how snake works.\nLet's look at the body list: `Body: [(5, 8)]`.\nHead is (5, 7).\nThis means my head moved DOWN to (5, 7).\nPrevious head must have been (5, 8).\nPrevious body must have been [(5, 9)].\nWait, the last move rationale says \"My current head is at (5, 9) and my body is at (6, 9)\".\nThis is inconsistent with the current state provided in the prompt.\nHowever, the current board state is authoritative for the current turn.\nCurrent Head: (5, 7)\nCurrent Body: [(5, 8)]\nThis implies my head moved DOWN from (5, 8) to (5, 7), and my tail moved from... wait.\nIf my head is (5, 7) and body is (5, 8), I must have moved DOWN.\nPrevious head was (5, 8). Previous body was (5, 9).\nMy length is 2. I ate an apple, so my length should be 3? No, the prompt says \"Apples collected: 1\".\nIf I ate an apple on the last turn, I would have grown.\nLet's check the board state again.\nRow 7: `A A . . . 1 . . . .`\nRow 8: `. . T T T T . . . .`\nRow 9: `A 0 T . . . . . . .`\nEnemy at (1, 9).\nI am at (5, 7).\nBody at (5, 8).\nLet's trace my moves:\nTurn 1: Started?\nTurn 5: Current.\nThe prompt says \"My last move information: ... DOWN\".\nSo I moved DOWN last turn.\nIf I moved DOWN from (5, 8) to (5, 7), and my body is now (5, 8), then my previous body was (5, 9).\nPrevious head was (5, 8).\nSo I was at (5, 8) with body (5, 9).\nDid I eat an apple?\nThe board shows apples at (5, 4), (5, 3) etc. Not at (5, 7) or (5, 8).\nWait, row 7 shows `A A . . . 1 . . . .`\nCoordinates: (0,7) is A, (1,7) is A, (5,7) is 1 (my head).\nSo (5, 7) is NOT an apple.\nI did not eat an apple last turn.\nMy length is 2.\nIf my length is 2, and I moved DOWN from (5, 8) to (5, 7), my body must have been at (5, 9).\nSo previous state: Head (5, 8), Body (5, 9).\nCurrent state: Head (5, 7), Body (5, 8).\nThis matches the \"DOWN\" move.\n\nSo, I am at (5, 7).\nMy body is at (5, 8).\nEnemy snake #0 is at (1, 9).\nEnemy body: [(2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8)].\nWait, the board shows row 9: `A 0 T . . . . . . .`\nHead at (1, 9).\nBody at (2, 9).\nRow 8: `. . T T T T . . . .`\nBody at (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8).\nSo the enemy is a horizontal line at y=8 from x=2 to x=4, and vertical at x=2 from y=8 to y=9.\n\nI need to decide my next move.\nAvailable moves from (5, 7):\n- UP: (5, 8). This is my body. Suicide.\n- DOWN: (5, 6).\n- LEFT: (4, 7).\n- RIGHT: (6, 7).\n\nCheck board for (5, 6):\nRow 6: `A . . . A . . . . .`\n(5, 6) is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n\nCheck board for (4, 7):\nRow 7: `A A . . . 1 . . . .` (Wait, this is row 7 y=7).\nLet's map the rows carefully.\nRow 9 (y=9): `A 0 T . . . . . . .`\nRow 8 (y=8): `. . T T T T . . . .`\nRow 7 (y=7): `A A . . . 1 . . . .`\nRow 6 (y=6): `A . . . A . . . . .`\nRow 5 (y=5): `. . . . . . . . . A`\nRow 4 (y=4): `. . A A . A . . . .`\n...\n\nSo (4, 7) corresponds to x=4, y=7. In row 7, index 4 is `.`.\n(6, 7) corresponds to x=6, y=7. In row 7, index 6 is `.`.\n\nSo I have 3 safe moves: DOWN (5, 6), LEFT (4, 7), RIGHT (6, 7).\n\nNow, I must consider the enemy's potential moves and apples.\n\nApples near me:\n(4, 6) is an apple.\n(5, 4) is an apple.\n(5, 3) is an apple.\n(3, 4) is an apple.\n(2, 4) is an apple.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 6):\nI am at (5, 6). My body will be (5, 7).\nI am closer to (5, 4) and (4, 6).\n(4, 6) is adjacent to (5, 6). I could eat it next turn.\nHowever, (4, 6) is also adjacent to (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6), (4, 7).\nIs there any competition? The enemy is at (1, 9). They are far away.\nBut I should check if moving DOWN is safe against enemy head movement.\nEnemy head is at (1, 9).\nEnemy can move UP (1, 10 - invalid), DOWN (1, 8 - body), LEFT (0, 9 - apple), RIGHT (2, 9 - body).\nSo enemy must go LEFT to (0, 9) or stay? No, they must move.\nWait, (1, 8) is `T` (body of enemy). So DOWN is blocked.\n(2, 9) is `T` (body). RIGHT is blocked.\nSo enemy must go LEFT to (0, 9).\n(0, 9) is `A` (apple).\nSo the enemy will definitely move LEFT to (0, 9) this turn.\nThis puts the enemy head at (0, 9).\nTheir body will extend to (1, 9).\nThey will not be near me.\nSo moving DOWN to (5, 6) is safe from the enemy.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 7):\nI am at (4, 7). Body at (5, 7).\nI am closer to (4, 6).\nI can potentially eat (4, 6) next turn.\nHowever, I am moving towards the left side of the board.\nThe left side has apples at (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 2).\n(0, 9) will be occupied by the enemy head.\n(0, 7) and (0, 6) are free.\nBut the left wall is a trap if I get pinned.\nAlso, the enemy is moving to (0, 9). They are moving away from me.\nIf I go LEFT, I am leaving the center.\nThe center has dense apples: (5, 4), (4, 6), (3, 4), (2, 4), (5, 3).\nIf I go LEFT, I can eat (4, 6).\nIf I go DOWN, I can eat (4, 6) or (5, 4).\nActually, from (5, 6), I can reach (4, 6) next turn (LEFT).\nFrom (5, 6), I can reach (5, 4) in two turns (DOWN, DOWN).\nFrom (4, 7), I can reach (4, 6) in one turn (DOWN).\nFrom (4, 7), I can reach (3, 4) in two turns? (LEFT, DOWN...).\n\nLet's evaluate the center area.\nThe area around (5, 4) is a cluster.\n(5, 4) is apple.\n(4, 4) is apple.\n(5, 3) is apple.\n(6, 3) is apple.\n(3, 4) is apple.\n(2, 4) is apple.\n\nI am currently at (5, 7).\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 6):\nI can go DOWN to (5, 5) (empty).\nThen DOWN to (5, 4) (apple).\nOr I can go LEFT to (4, 6) (apple).\nGoing DOWN into the cluster seems strong.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7):\nI can go DOWN to (4, 6) (apple).\nThen I am at (4, 6).\nFrom (4, 6), I can go DOWN to (4, 5) (empty).\nThen LEFT to (3, 4) (apple) or DOWN to (4, 4) (apple).\nOr RIGHT to (5, 4) (apple).\n\nCompare the two options:\nOption 1 (DOWN to 5,6):\nPath: (5,7) -> (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (5,4) [Eat].\nLength grows. Position (5,4) is central.\nOption 2 (LEFT to 4,7):\nPath: (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (4,6) [Eat].\nThen (4,5) -> (4,4) [Eat] or (5,4) [Eat].\nPath 2 allows eating an apple sooner (turn 6 vs turn 7 for the first apple?).\nWait, if I go DOWN to (5,6), I can eat (4,6) on turn 7.\nIf I go LEFT to (4,7), I can eat (4,6) on turn 6.\nSo LEFT gets me an apple one turn faster.\nHowever, going DOWN puts me in a better position to eat the cluster at (5,4), (4,4), (5,3).\nAlso, I should consider the geometry.\nFrom (5,6), I have options: (5,5), (4,6), (6,6).\nFrom (4,7), I have options: (4,6), (3,7), (5,7) (tail). (4,8) is enemy body.\nSo (4,7) is slightly constrained on the right (my tail) and top (enemy).\n(5,6) is open on left, right, down.\n\nThe enemy is moving to (0,9).\nThey are not a threat.\nThe only threat is running into myself or walls.\nThe center cluster is valuable.\nLet's look at (5, 4) again.\nIt is surrounded by apples.\nIf I can get to (5, 4) and eat it, I become length 3.\nMy body will be (5, 5), (5, 6).\nThen I can eat (4, 4) or (5, 3).\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 6) now, I am setting up for (5, 4).\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7), I am setting up for (4, 6).\n\nWhich is better? (5, 4) is a \"center\" apple. (4, 6) is slightly offset.\nActually, looking at the board:\n(5, 4) is adjacent to (4, 4) and (5, 3) and (6, 3).\n(4, 6) is adjacent to (4, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6).\n(4, 6) is close to (4, 4).\nBut (5, 4) is closer to (6, 3).\nLet's look at the density.\nCluster 1: (5, 4), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4).\nCluster 2: (4, 6), (5, 6), (4, 5).\nCluster 1 is denser and more central.\nI should prioritize Cluster 1.\n\nTo reach Cluster 1:\nFrom (5, 7):\nMove DOWN to (5, 6).\nMove DOWN to (5, 5).\nMove DOWN to (5, 4) [Eat].\nTotal moves: 3 turns.\nFirst apple on turn 8.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7):\nMove DOWN to (4, 6) [Eat] (Turn 6).\nMove DOWN to (4, 5) (Turn 7).\nMove DOWN to (4, 4) [Eat] (Turn 8).\nTotal moves: 2 turns for first apple, 3 turns for second.\nSo LEFT gets me an apple faster, but the apples are slightly less central.\n\nHowever, there is a constraint.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 6), my body is at (5, 7).\nNext turn (Turn 6), I can go DOWN to (5, 5).\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7), my body is at (5, 7).\nNext turn (Turn 6), I can go DOWN to (4, 6).\n(4, 6) is an apple.\nIf I go to (4, 6), I eat it.\nThen my body becomes [(4, 7), (5, 7)].\nI am at (4, 6).\nI can go DOWN to (4, 5).\nThen I can go DOWN to (4, 4) [Eat].\nOr LEFT to (3, 4) [Eat].\nOr RIGHT to (5, 4) [Eat].\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 6):\nI am at (5, 6).\nNext turn I can go DOWN to (5, 5).\nThen DOWN to (5, 4) [Eat].\nOr LEFT to (4, 4) [Eat].\nOr RIGHT to (6, 4) (empty).\nWait, (6, 4) is empty.\n(6, 3) is an apple.\nIf I am at (5, 4), I can go RIGHT to (6, 4) then DOWN to (6, 3).\n\nLet's check if (5, 6) is safe from enemy.\nEnemy is at (1, 9). Moving to (0, 9).\nDistance is huge. Safe.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer LEFT?\nGoing LEFT brings me closer to the left wall (x=0).\nThe left wall has apples: (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 2).\nBut the enemy is currently at (0, 9). They just ate (0, 9) (implied).\nThey might move down the left side.\nIf the enemy moves down the left side, they might eat (0, 7) and (0, 6).\nIf I am on the left side, I might encounter the enemy.\nIf I stay in the center/right, I avoid the enemy.\nThe enemy is at x=1.\nI am at x=5.\nDistance is 4 units.\nIf I go LEFT to x=4, distance is 3.\nIf I go DOWN to x=5, distance is 4.\nSo staying at x=5 keeps me further from the enemy.\n\nAlso, the center cluster is safer from walls.\nIf I go to (5, 4), I am at x=5, y=4.\nIf I go to (4, 6), I am at x=4, y=6.\n(4, 6) is closer to the enemy than (5, 4).\n(4, 6) is 3 units away from enemy (if enemy at 1,9 -> 1,8...).\n(5, 4) is 4 units away (horizontal) + 4 vertical? No.\nDistance is Manhattan distance.\n(4, 6) vs (1, 9): |4-1| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n(5, 4) vs (1, 9): |5-1| + |4-9| = 4 + 5 = 9.\nSo (5, 4) is much safer.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (5, 6) is the safer strategic choice to enter the central cluster.\n\nLet's double check the \"Backwards\" rule.\nI am at (5, 7).\nMy body is at (5, 8).\nMy previous move was DOWN (from 5,8 to 5,7).\nSo I came from UP.\nIf I move UP now, I go back to (5, 8) which is my body.\nSo UP is blocked (suicide).\nDOWN is free.\nLEFT is free.\nRIGHT is free.\n\nIs (6, 7) a good move?\n(6, 7) is empty.\nFrom there, I can go to (6, 6), (6, 5)...\n(6, 3) is an apple.\nBut (6, 4) is empty.\nThe area at x=6 seems less dense than x=4 or x=5.\n(5, 4) and (4, 4) are adjacent.\n(3, 4) and (2, 4) are adjacent.\nThis is the best cluster.\nI need to get to y=4.\nMoving DOWN is the most direct way to lower y.\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT keeps me at y=7.\nSo DOWN is the best move to reach the valuable apples.\n\nWait, looking at the board again:\nRow 6: `A . . . A . . . . .`\n(0, 6) is A, (4, 6) is A.\nRow 5: `. . . . . . . . . A`\nRow 4: `. . A A . A . . . .`\n(2, 4), (3, 4), (5, 4) are apples.\nRow 3: `. . . . . A A . A .`\n(5, 3), (6, 3), (8, 3) are apples.\n\nThe cluster (5, 4), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3) is very strong.\nTo reach it:\nFrom (5, 7):\nDOWN -> (5, 6)\nDOWN -> (5, 5)\nDOWN -> (5, 4) [Eat]\nLEFT -> (4, 4) [Eat]\nDOWN -> (4, 3) (empty)\nRIGHT -> (5, 3) [Eat]\nRIGHT -> (6, 3) [Eat]\nDOWN -> (6, 2) (empty)\nRIGHT -> (7, 3) (empty)\nRIGHT -> (8, 3) [Eat]\n\nThis path is safe and yields many apples.\nThe only risk is the enemy moving faster than me?\nThe enemy has 4 apples. I have 1.\nThe enemy is at (1, 9).\nThe nearest apples for the enemy are (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 2).\nThey have to traverse down the left edge.\nI have the center.\nI can eat (5, 4) in 3 turns.\nThe enemy needs to eat (0, 7), (0, 6)...\nThey are trapped on the left wall.\nI control the center.\nI should definitely move DOWN.\n\nOne detail: The enemy is at (1, 9). (0, 9) is an apple.\nIf the enemy moves to (0, 9), they eat an apple.\nThey grow.\nThey might try to cross the board?\nBut with body length 5 (4 body + 1 head), they are somewhat long.\nThey are constrained by the wall.\nI am open.\nI will move DOWN.\n\nFinal check on move safety:\n- DOWN (5, 6): Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (4, 7): Empty. Safe, but moves towards left side.\n- RIGHT (6, 7): Empty. Safe, but moves to less dense area.\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan:\nMove DOWN to (5, 6) to approach the dense apple cluster in the center (5,4, 4,4, 5,3, 6,3). Avoid the left wall where the enemy is heading. Secure the central area to outgrow the enemy.\n\nMove: DOWN",

Body at (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8). Length 5. They have 5 apples. They are on the left side of the board, moving towards the wall.\n- **Board State:** The center of the board (around y=4) contains a dense cluster of apples: (5, 4), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4). This is the primary objective.\n- **Turn Counter:** 6 / 150. I have plenty of time.\n- **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy is at (1, 9). They are sandwiched between the wall at x=0 and their own body at x=2. Their only legal move is LEFT to (0, 9), where there is an apple. They will eat and grow, but they are effectively trapping themselves on the left edge. They are not an immediate threat.\n\n**Move Evaluation from (5, 7):**\n1.  **UP (5, 8):** Blocked by my own body. Suicide.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 6):** The cell (5, 6) is empty. This moves me closer to the apple cluster at y=4. This is the most direct path to the high-value central apples. From (5, 6), I can proceed to (5, 5) then (5, 4) to eat. This route is open and safe.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 7):** The cell (4, 7) is empty. However, this moves me away from the vertical column x=5, which holds apples at (5, 4) and (5, 3). While (4, 7) is adjacent to the apple at (4, 6), going DOWN allows me to coordinate a path to both (5, 4) and (4, 6) or (4, 4) more effectively.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 7):** The cell (6, 7) is empty. Moving right takes me into a less dense area of apples compared to the central cluster.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe goal is to secure the central cluster of apples before the enemy (or any hypothetical future threats) can reach it. The enemy is currently preoccupied with the left edge. Moving DOWN directly initiates the approach to the most valuable resource density on the board. It maintains an open line of retreat and multiple avenues for expansion (left to 4,4 or right to 6,3).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to enter the central valley. Next turn, I will evaluate the path to (5, 4) or (4, 6). I will avoid the left wall where the enemy is trapped and dominate the center.\n\nDOWN",

Suicide.\n  - DOWN (5, 4): An apple. Safe and edible.\n  - LEFT (4, 5): Empty. Leads towards (4, 6) apple.\n  - RIGHT (6, 5): Empty.\n- **Enemy Analysis:**\n  - The enemy at (0, 8) has a critical problem. To the LEFT is the wall (suicide). To the RIGHT is (1, 8), which is currently empty (see board state: Row 8 is \"0 . T T...\" so (1, 8) is '.').\n  - However, the enemy's body occupies (2, 8).\n  - The enemy's body also includes (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), and (3, 8). This forms a wall.\n  - The enemy is \"sandwiched\" on the left edge. While they are currently trapped, they are likely to push RIGHT to survive. If they move RIGHT to (1, 8), they risk eventually hitting their own tail if it doesn't move correctly, but it's their only way off the wall.\n  - Because they are 9 columns away from me, they are not an immediate threat. I can safely focus on resource gathering.\n- **Move Evaluation:**\n  - **UP (5, 6):** Blocked by my body. Dead.\n  - **DOWN (5, 4):** Contains an apple. This is a guaranteed point. From (5, 4), I will have access to (5, 3) [apple], (4, 4) [apple], and (6, 4) [empty].\n  - **LEFT (4, 5):** Empty. Adjacent to (4, 6) [apple] and (3, 4) [apple].\n  - **RIGHT (6, 5):** Empty. Adjacent to (6, 3) [apple], but further from the dense cluster core.\n- **Strategy:**\n  - Taking the immediate apple at (5, 4) is the optimal move. It guarantees growth and keeps me in the vertical line x=5 which contains multiple apples ((5, 4) now eaten, (5, 3) still there).\n  - Moving DOWN also prepares me to head towards the bottom-right apples if the central cluster dries up.\n  - I must avoid trapping myself. Moving into the apple at (5, 4) opens up three directions for the next turn (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN).\n\n**Plan:** Eat the apple at (5, 4). Secure the center column first, then branch out.\nEND LAST RATIONALE\n\nDOWN",

Safe (empty).\n    - RIGHT (6, 4): Empty.\n- **Enemy Analysis:**\n  - Enemy is at (0, 7). Their body blocks (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), etc.\n  - They are moving simultaneously. If they move UP to (0, 8), that is currently their body. They will die unless their tail moves.\n  - However, their tail is at (3, 8). If they move UP, their tail will move from (3, 8) to (3, 7) (assuming the body shifts).\n  - **Crucially:** If the enemy moves UP, (0, 8) becomes empty (tail moves). But (1, 8) is blocked by the body.\n  - If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 7), (1, 7) is currently an apple. The cell (1, 8) is blocked by their body.\n  - The enemy is trapped on the left edge. They have no immediate path towards me.\n  - Even if they move RIGHT, they are far away.\n- **Move Evaluation:**\n  - **UP (5, 5):** Blocked by self. **DEAD.**\n  - **DOWN (5, 3):** Contains an apple. Safe. Opens up (5, 2), (4, 3), (6, 3).\n  - **LEFT (4, 4):** Contains an apple. Safe. Opens up (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5).\n  - **RIGHT (6, 4):** Empty. Opens up (6, 3), (7, 4).\n- **Strategy:**\n  - I must avoid suicide.\n  - I am in a dense apple cluster.\n  - Moving DOWN to (5, 3) gives me access to (5, 2) [apple], (4, 3) [apple], and (6, 3) [apple].\n  - Moving LEFT to (4, 4) gives me access to (3, 4) [apple], (4, 3) [apple], and (4, 5) [empty].\n  - Moving RIGHT to (6, 4) gives access to (6, 3) [apple] but puts me closer to the open right side, which might be better for long-term survival but risks running into the enemy if they somehow break out (unlikely).\n  - **Decision:** The enemy is not a threat. I should focus on apples.\n  - Looking at the board, (4, 4) and (5, 3) are both apples.\n  - If I go DOWN to (5, 3), I eat an apple and stay in column 5. From there, I can go LEFT to (4, 3) (apple) or DOWN to (5, 2) (apple).\n  - If I go LEFT to (4, 4), I eat an apple. From there, I can go DOWN to (4, 3) (apple) or LEFT to (3, 4) (apple).\n  - Both are good.\n  - However, notice (4, 5) is empty. If I go DOWN to (5, 3), I have (4, 3) and (5, 2) as apples.\n  - If I go LEFT to (4, 4), I eat (4, 4). My tail (5, 6) moves to (5, 5).\n  - Let's check safety carefully.\n  - **LEFT to (4, 4):** Cell (4, 4) is an apple. It is currently empty. It is not adjacent to the enemy. The enemy is at (0, 7). Distance is large. The enemy is trapped.\n  - **DOWN to (5, 3):** Cell (5, 3) is an apple. Safe.\n  - **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Empty.\n  - **UP is suicide.**\n  - I will choose **LEFT**. Why? Because (4, 4) connects me to (3, 4) and (4, 3). (5, 3) connects me to (5, 2) and (4, 3). Both are good paths.\n  - However, looking at the map, the \"dense\" cluster is centered around (4,4), (5,3), etc.\n  - Let's look at the map again.\n    Row 4: `. . A A . 1 . . . .`\n    Row 3: `. . . . . A A . A .`\n    Row 2: `A . . . . . . . A .`\n  - If I go LEFT to (4, 4), I am on an apple. Next turn, (4, 3) is an apple. (3, 4) is an apple.\n  - If I go DOWN to (5, 3), I am on an apple. Next turn, (5, 2) is an apple. (4, 3) is an apple.\n  - Both options lead to more apples.\n  - Let's consider the \"trap\" potential.\n  - The enemy is far away.\n  - I am in the middle of the board.\n  - Moving LEFT puts me closer to the center column (x=4) which is surrounded by apples.\n  - Moving DOWN puts me closer to the bottom edge (y=2).\n  - Moving LEFT seems slightly better because (3, 4) is an apple, and (2, 4) is an apple. There's a vertical line of apples on column 3/4.\n  - Actually, (3, 4) is an apple. (2, 4) is an apple.\n  - Let's verify safety of (4, 4).\n    - (4, 4) is empty.\n    - Neighbors of (4, 4): (4, 3) [apple], (4, 5) [empty], (3, 4) [apple], (5, 4) [My old head].\n    - My tail is at (5, 6). It moves to (5, 5).\n    - My body will be [(4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)].\n    - I will not collide with myself.\n  - Let's verify safety of (5, 3).\n    - (5, 3) is an apple.\n    - Neighbors: (5, 2) [apple], (5, 4) [Old head], (4, 3) [apple], (6, 3) [apple].\n    - Body: [(5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)].\n    - Safe.\n  - Let's verify safety of (6, 4).\n    - (6, 4) is empty.\n    - Neighbors: (6, 3) [apple], (6, 5) [empty], (5, 4) [Old head], (7, 4) [empty].\n    - Safe.\n  - The enemy is the only threat.\n  - Enemy at (0, 7). If they move RIGHT to (1, 7), they eat an apple. They grow. Their body shifts.\n  - They are far away.\n  - I will choose **LEFT**. It provides a solid path to apples (3, 4) and (4, 3).\n  - Wait, let's double check the enemy's move possibilities.\n  - Enemy at (0, 7).\n  - UP: (0, 8). Currently occupied by enemy body.\n    - If enemy moves UP, the tail moves. The tail is at (3, 8). The segment at (0, 8) becomes part of the body?\n    - The body is `[(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8)]`.\n    - If head moves to (0, 8), the new body is `[(0, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]`? No, that's a collision with self immediately if (0, 8) is occupied by the body.\n    - Wait, the body list is `[(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8)]`.\n    - The cell (0, 8) is occupied by the body segment. Moving into (0, 8) is moving into their own body.\n    - So UP is suicide for the enemy (unless they grow, but they can't move into their own body).\n    - Wait, the rule is \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n    - So UP is likely a bad move for them.\n  - RIGHT: (1, 7). Currently an apple. Safe.\n  - DOWN: (0, 6). Currently an apple. Safe.\n  - The enemy will likely not move UP. They will move RIGHT or DOWN.\n  - They are at (0, 7). They are 5 steps away from me in X (0 vs 5).\n  - I am safe from collision.\n  - I will move **LEFT** to (4, 4).\n\n**Plan:** Eat apple at (4, 4). This sets up a path to eat (3, 4) and (4, 3) next. The enemy is trapped on the left edge and poses no immediate threat. Prioritize growth.\nEND LAST RATIONALE\nLEFT",

My body is at (5, 4) and (5, 5). (4, 5) is not in my body list.\n    *   Is it occupied by enemy snake #0? Enemy is at x=0, I am at x=4. Distance is 4 units. Enemy cannot reach (4, 5) in one move from (0, 6) (max distance 1). So (4, 5) is safe.\n    *   Does it lead to a trap? (4, 5) is empty. Neighbors: (4, 4) (will be empty after I leave), (4, 6) (Apple), (3, 5) (Empty), (5, 5) (Will be empty as tail moves). This seems open.\n\n2.  **DOWN (4, 3)**:\n    *   Is (4, 3) safe?\n    *   It is empty on the board.\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? No.\n    *   Is it occupied by enemy? No.\n    *   Does it lead to a trap? (4, 3) is empty. Neighbors: (4, 2) (Apple), (4, 4) (Will be empty), (3, 3) (Empty), (5, 3) (Apple). Also open.\n\n3.  **LEFT (3, 4)**:\n    *   Is (3, 4) safe?\n    *   It contains an apple. Apples are empty cells.\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? No.\n    *   Is it occupied by enemy? No.\n    *   Does it lead to a trap? (3, 4) neighbors: (3, 3) (Empty), (3, 5) (Empty), (2, 4) (Apple), (4, 4) (Will be empty). Open.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 4)**:\n    *   Is (5, 4) safe?\n    *   It is my current body segment.\n    *   Moving here is moving into my own body. **DEAD**.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, and LEFT are all safe moves.\n\nWhich one is best?\n*   **UP to (4, 5)**: Leads to an apple at (4, 6). (4, 6) is currently safe. My tail moves from (5, 5) to (5, 4). My new body: [(4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 5)].\n*   **DOWN to (4, 3)**: Leads to apples at (4, 2) and (5, 3). My tail moves to (5, 4). My new body: [(4, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)].\n*   **LEFT to (3, 4)**: Eats an apple immediately. Leads to apples at (2, 4) and (3, 3). My tail moves to (5, 4). My new body: [(3, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)].\n\nI am growing this turn if I choose LEFT. If I choose UP or DOWN, I am not growing this turn (unless I hit an apple, which I don't for UP/DOWN).\nWait, let's re-read the board for UP and DOWN.\nBoard row 5 (y=5): `. . . . . T . . . A`. (5, 5) is my tail (T). (4, 5) is empty.\nBoard row 3 (y=3): `. . . . . A A A A .`. (4, 3) is empty.\n\nSo:\n*   **LEFT (3, 4)**: Eats an apple. **Growth +1**.\n*   **UP (4, 5)**: No apple. No growth.\n*   **DOWN (4, 3)**: No apple. No growth.\n\nStrategy: Growth is priority. Eating an apple immediately is better than moving to an empty cell.\nWhy? Because in Snake, eating an apple extends your tail. An extended tail gives you more maneuverability later. An apple eaten now is worth 1 point. An apple eaten later is also 1 point. But eating now secures the point.\n\nIs there any reason *not* to eat the apple at (3, 4)?\nIf I eat at (3, 4):\n*   My head moves to (3, 4).\n*   My tail moves from (5, 5) to (5, 4).\n*   My body becomes [(3, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)].\n*   Next turn, I can go to (2, 4) (Apple), (3, 3) (Empty), (3, 5) (Empty), (4, 4) (Empty).\n*   This is very safe.\n\nIf I don't eat and go UP to (4, 5):\n*   Head (4, 5). Tail moves to (5, 4).\n*   Body: [(4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 5)].\n*   Next turn, I can go to (4, 6) (Apple), (3, 5) (Empty), (5, 5) (Occupied by body).\n*   This is safe, but I missed an apple.\n\nIf I don't eat and go DOWN to (4, 3):\n*   Head (4, 3). Tail moves to (5, 4).\n*   Body: [(4, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)].\n*   Next turn, I can go to (4, 2) (Apple), (5, 3) (Apple), (3, 3) (Empty).\n*   This is safe, but I missed an apple.\n\nThe choice is clear: Eat the apple at (3, 4).\n\nEnemy check:\nSnake #0 is at (0, 6) with body extending up to (0, 9) and along the top row. They are very far away (x=0 vs x=3). They cannot reach me. They are not a threat for this move.\n\nPlan: Eat the apple at (3, 4). This is the only move that guarantees growth this turn. The board is open around (3, 4), ensuring survival for the next turn.\n\nLEFT",

Apples are at (0,2), (8,3), (1,7), (4,6), (6,3), (9,5), (8,2), (4,1), (5,3), (9,8), (7,9), (7,0), (7,3), (6,4), (3,5). The enemy snake #0 is at (0,4) with a long tail stretching to (2,9).\n\nI need to determine my move for Turn 11. I must consider the simultaneous movement of the enemy snake.\n\n**Analysis of Moves for Turn 11:**\n\n1.  **UP to (2,5):**\n    *   Target cell is currently empty.\n    *   My body is at (3,4), (4,4), etc. (2,5) is safe from self-collision.\n    *   Enemy snake #0 is at (0,4). It likely moves UP to (0,5) or (0,3). If it moves UP, it stays on column 0. It cannot reach (2,5) this turn.\n    *   Outcome: Safe. No apple. I move into the open area near the top-left.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2,3):**\n    *   Target cell is currently empty.\n    *   My body is at (3,4)... (2,3) is safe from self-collision.\n    *   Enemy snake #0 is far away (column 0).\n    *   Outcome: Safe. No apple.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1,4):**\n    *   Target cell (1,4) is currently empty (board state shows `.` at (1,4)).\n    *   My body is at (3,4) etc. Safe from self-collision.\n    *   Enemy snake #0 head is at (0,4).\n    *   **CRITICAL:** If the enemy snake moves RIGHT to (1,4), we will collide head-on, and both snakes will die.\n    *   Does the enemy snake have a reason to move RIGHT? The cell (1,4) is empty. Moving RIGHT from (0,4) would move the head into an empty space. The enemy has a large body trailing behind. The apple at (2,4) was eaten in the previous turn (implied by my last move being LEFT to (2,4) and current head being (2,4)).\n    *   The enemy snake is at (0,4). Its body is at (0,5) and down to (0,9) then (1,9)... So (0,4) is connected to (0,5).\n    *   If the enemy moves UP to (0,5), it hits its own body at (0,5) because the body segment (0,5) is currently occupied (part of the snake). Wait, looking at the enemy body list: `Body: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)]`.\n    *   The enemy head is at (0,4). The next body segment is at (0,5). If the enemy moves UP to (0,5), it moves into its own body (the segment currently at 0,5) and dies.\n    *   Can the enemy move DOWN? (0,4) -> (0,3). (0,3) is empty on the board. This is a valid move.\n    *   Can the enemy move LEFT? (0,4) -> (-1,4). Off board. Dies.\n    *   Can the enemy move RIGHT? (0,4) -> (1,4). Empty. Valid.\n    *   So the enemy can move DOWN to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,4).\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,4), and I move LEFT to (1,4), we collide and both die.\n    *   Is the enemy likely to move RIGHT? The enemy is snake #0 with 7 apples. I have 4 apples. The enemy is likely trying to win. Moving RIGHT towards the center/open space seems more aggressive/standard than moving DOWN into a corner (0,3). There is an apple at (0,2) directly below (0,3). Moving DOWN to (0,3) puts the enemy next to the apple at (0,2) for the following turn. Moving RIGHT to (1,4) puts the enemy in the open.\n    *   However, (1,4) is a collision risk. Since I cannot know the enemy's move for sure, I should avoid a move that leads to a potential head-on collision if I can avoid it.\n    *   However, if the enemy moves DOWN, (1,4) is empty and safe for me.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3,4):**\n    *   Target cell (3,4) is my own body (the segment immediately behind my head).\n    *   Moving here is illegal (suicide) and results in death.\n    *   **DEADLY.**\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n*   UP (2,5): Safe, open space.\n*   DOWN (2,3): Safe, open space.\n*   LEFT (1,4): Safe *unless* enemy moves RIGHT. If enemy moves RIGHT, I die. If enemy moves DOWN, I live.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI need to maximize my chance of survival and winning.\n*   **UP (2,5)**: Moves me into the upper open area. I am heading towards apples like (1,7), (3,5), (4,6).\n*   **DOWN (2,3)**: Moves me down. There is an apple at (1,2) or nearby (4,1), (5,3).\n*   **LEFT (1,4)**: Moves me left. There is an apple at (0,2) far below, or (1,7) up. But the immediate collision risk with the enemy is high if it decides to explore right.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0,4). Its body blocks (0,5). It cannot go UP. It must go DOWN or RIGHT.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN to (0,3), it positions itself to eat the apple at (0,2) on the next turn.\nIf the enemy goes RIGHT to (1,4), it enters the center.\nGiven that the enemy is winning (7 apples vs 4), it might play aggressively to maintain its lead or secure more apples. However, the apple at (0,2) is very close and attractive.\nIf I move LEFT to (1,4) and the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,4), we both die. This is a draw. I don't want a draw; I want to win. A draw is better than a loss, but I need to gain apples.\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I avoid the direct collision vector with the enemy.\nMoving UP seems best to gain vertical positioning and approach the apples in the upper half (1,7), (3,5), (4,6).\n\nLet's verify coordinates:\nCurrent Head: (2,4)\nBody: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\nApples: (3,5) is an apple!\nWait, (3,5) is listed in the apples at the top.\n`Apples at: ..., (3, 5), ...`\nMy current head is (2,4).\nIf I move UP, I go to (2,5). (2,5) is empty.\nIf I move UP to (2,5), I am adjacent to the apple at (3,5).\nNext turn, I could potentially move RIGHT to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the collision risk for LEFT (1,4).\nEnemy at (0,4). Body at (0,5). If enemy moves UP, it dies (hits its own body at 0,5).\nEnemy must move DOWN or RIGHT.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (1,4), I die if I move LEFT.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (0,3), I survive.\nIs there any reason for the enemy to move DOWN? Yes, the apple at (0,2).\nIs there any reason for the enemy to move RIGHT? Yes, to explore.\nHowever, if the enemy moves RIGHT, it risks running into my body or future traps, but immediately, it's open.\nGiven the \"ultrathink\" requirement, I should consider if I can force a win.\nIf I move UP, I am safe from the enemy (distance > 1).\nIf I move DOWN, I am safe.\nIf I move LEFT, I gamble.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 5: `T . . A . T . . . A`\nRow 4: `0 . 1 T T T A . . .`\nMy head is at (2,4). The cell (3,4) is my body (T). (4,4) is my body.\nThe apple at (3,5) is to my right-up diagonal.\nThe apple at (2,4) was eaten (implied by my last move LEFT).\n\nMy current position is (2,4).\nIf I move UP to (2,5):\n- Position: (2,5).\n- Body follows: Head (2,5), old head (2,4), then (3,4), etc.\n- I am safe.\n- I am close to apple at (3,5) (distance 1 diagonal, 1 step Manhattan if I turn right next).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,3):\n- Position: (2,3).\n- This moves me towards the bottom of the board.\n- There is an apple at (4,1) and (5,3).\n- This is also safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,4):\n- Risk of collision with enemy if it moves RIGHT.\n- If I survive, I am at (1,4).\n- I am close to apple at (0,2) (requires Down-Left-Down) or (1,7) (Up-Up).\n\nGiven the enemy's position at (0,4) and its inability to move UP, it is confined to column 0 or moving right. If it moves right, it risks collision with me if I move left.\nTo ensure survival and position myself for the apple at (3,5), moving UP seems optimal. It avoids the potential conflict zone of (1,4).\n\nLet's double check the board.\n`Row 4: 0 . 1 T T T A . . .`\nMy head is at 1 (which is (2,4)).\nThe cell to my right (3,4) is T (my body).\nThe cell (2,5) is empty (Row 5: `T . . A . T...` at index 2 is `.`).\nThe cell (2,3) is empty (Row 3: `... . A A A...` at index 2 is `.`).\n\nWhat about the enemy?\nEnemy at (0,4).\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (1,4), and I move UP to (2,5), no collision.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (0,3), and I move UP, no collision.\n\nIs there any threat from the enemy moving to (2,4)? No, enemy is at (0,4). Distance is 2.\nIs there any threat from me moving into my own body?\nIf I move UP to (2,5), my body will be at (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5).\n(2,5) is not in that list.\n\nIs there any threat from other snakes? Only snake #0.\n\nLet's consider the \"future options\".\nMoving UP to (2,5) places me in the upper half of the board.\nFrom (2,5), I can reach:\n- (3,5) (Apple) -> Next turn RIGHT.\n- (1,7) (Apple) -> Up-Left.\n- (4,6) (Apple) -> Up-Right.\n\nMoving DOWN to (2,3) places me in the lower half.\nFrom (2,3), I can reach:\n- (4,1) (Apple) -> Down-Right.\n- (5,3) (Apple) -> Right-Right.\n- (0,2) (Apple) -> Left-Left-Down.\n\nThe apple at (3,5) is very close (1 step away diagonally). Securing this apple quickly is important to catch up to the enemy (who has 7 apples). I have 4 apples. Eating (3,5) gives me 5.\nThe enemy has 7 apples. It needs 23 more to win. I need 26.\nI need to eat apples efficiently.\n\nThe enemy is at (0,4). It is likely to go for the apple at (0,2) or explore right.\nIf the enemy goes for (0,2), it will be busy in the left corner.\nIf the enemy goes right, it enters the central area.\nBy moving UP, I clear the left side and move towards the center-top apples.\nAlso, my body is currently at (3,4)...(5,5). Moving UP keeps my body spread out vertically.\n\nLet's review the collision rule one last time for LEFT (1,4).\nEnemy at (0,4).\nEnemy moves: DOWN to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,4).\nI move: LEFT to (1,4).\nIf I move LEFT and Enemy moves RIGHT -> Collision -> Death.\nI cannot predict the enemy's move with 100% certainty.\nHowever, moving UP guarantees survival against the enemy (enemy cannot reach (2,5) in one move).\nMoving DOWN guarantees survival.\nMoving LEFT risks death.\n\nIn competitive Snake, avoiding 50/50 risks when you are behind is crucial. If I die now, I lose (0 apples vs 7). If I survive, I can catch up.\nTherefore, I must avoid the move that risks immediate head-on collision with the enemy.\nSo, LEFT is risky.\nUP and DOWN are safe.\nBetween UP and DOWN, UP moves me towards the apple at (3,5) and the denser cluster of apples in the upper half (check apples list: (1,7), (4,6), (3,5), (9,5), etc.).\nDown moves me towards (4,1), (5,3), (6,3).\nThere are plenty of apples in both directions.\nBut the apple at (3,5) is immediately adjacent to my potential path.\nIf I go UP, I am at (2,5). Next turn I can go RIGHT to (3,5) and eat the apple.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (2,3). I am 2 steps away from (3,5) (via (3,4) which is my body... no, I can't go through body).\nTo get to (3,5) from (2,3) would require (2,4) (my old body position, which will be empty after I move, but then I have to navigate around). It's more complicated.\nFrom (2,5), the path to (3,5) is clear and direct.\nAlso, (2,5) is closer to (1,7) and (4,6).\n\nDecision: Move UP.\n\nOne final check on the board.\nRow 4: `0 . 1 T T T A . . .`\nMy head is at index 2 (x=2).\nIf I move UP, I go to (2,5).\nRow 5: `T . . A . T . . . A`\n(2,5) is index 2, which is `.`.\n(3,5) is index 3, which is `A`.\nWait, looking at the board drawing:\n`5 T . . A . T . . . A`\nIndices: 0:T, 1:., 2:., 3:A, 4:., 5:T...\nSo (2,5) is empty (index 2 is .).\n(3,5) is Apple (index 3 is A).\nThis is correct.\n\nSo moving UP puts me right next to an apple.\n\nIs there any trap?\nMy body is at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5).\nIf I move UP to (2,5), my tail will eventually move from (5,5) or wherever.\nThere is no immediate trap.\nThe enemy is far away.\n\nSo, UP is the best move. It is safe, positions me for an apple, and avoids the collision risk of LEFT.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\n`4 0 . 1 T T T A . . .`\nMy head is at (2,4).\nThe apple is at (3,4)? No, `(3, 4)` is `T` (my body).\nThe apple is at `(3, 5)`.\nWait, in the \"Apples at\" list: `(3, 5)` is present.\nIn the board row 5: `... A . T ...` at indices 3, 4, 5.\nSo (3,5) is `A`.\n(4,5) is `.`.\n(5,5) is `T` (my body).\nSo (3,5) is an apple.\nIf I move UP to (2,5), I am at (2,5). The apple is at (3,5).\nI am adjacent.\n\nIf I move UP, I should check if the enemy can reach (3,5) or (2,5) in the future.\nEnemy is at (0,4). It would take many turns to reach (3,5). I can eat it first.\n\nIs there any other immediate threat?\nEnemy snake #0 body: `(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)`.\nMy position (2,4) is far from (2,9).\nMy potential move (2,5) is far from (2,9).\nSafe.\n\nConclusion: Move UP.\n\nStrategy note:\nMove UP to (2,5). This position is safe from the enemy at (0,4) who cannot move UP. It positions me directly adjacent to the apple at (3,5) for the next turn. Eating (3,5) will bring my score to 5, closing the gap with the enemy (7). From (2,5), I will have access to the cluster of apples in the top-left (1,7, 4,6, etc.). I will avoid the collision zone at (1,4) to ensure survival.\n\nMove: UP",

I am currently length 5.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (0, 2). Body: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)]. It is length 9. It occupies a vertical strip on the left edge and corners the top-left (0,9) and top-right (1,9).\n    *   **Apples:** There is an apple at (2, 7). This is directly above my head (2, 6).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves (Turn 13):**\n\n    *   **Option 1: UP (to 2, 7)**\n        *   **Immediate Check:** Is (2, 7) an apple? Yes. This guarantees I eat an apple this turn, growing to length 6 and scoring 5 apples total.\n        *   **Safety Check:**\n            *   *Off Board:* No.\n            *   *Own Body:* My body segments are at (2,5), (2,4), etc. (2,7) is clear.\n            *   *Enemy Body:* Enemy body is on the left side (x=0 or 1). (2,7) is safe from collision with the enemy's body.\n        *   **Collision Prediction (Simultaneous Movement):**\n            *   *Head-on:* Can the enemy snake move to (2, 7) in one turn? Enemy head is at (0, 2). Manhattan distance is $|0-2| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7$. It is impossible for the enemy to reach (2,7) this turn. Safe.\n            *   *Body Check:* Can the enemy head move into my current body? Enemy head (0,2) is far from my body. Can my head move into the enemy's body? The enemy body is at x=0 and x=1. (2,7) is at x=2. Safe.\n        *   **Future Potential:** After moving to (2, 7), my head will be adjacent to apples at (1, 7) and (3, 5). (3, 5) is also adjacent to my current body (3, 4), so I must be careful not to trap myself, but (2, 7) is a relatively open spot with options to go Left, Right, or Down (back to (2,6), though that's effectively blocked by my own tail unless I eat and grow).\n        *   **Result:** SAFE and PROFITABLE.\n\n    *   **Option 2: RIGHT (to 3, 6)**\n        *   **Immediate Check:** Is (3, 6) an apple? No. Apples at (3,5) and (4,6) are adjacent.\n        *   **Safety Check:**\n            *   *Off Board:* No.\n            *   *Own Body:* My body is at (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4). (3,6) is clear.\n            *   *Enemy Body:* Safe.\n        *   **Collision Prediction:** Safe from immediate collision.\n        *   **Result:** SAFE, but does not score an apple this turn.\n\n    *   **Option 3: LEFT (to 1, 6)**\n        *   **Immediate Check:** Is (1, 6) an apple? No.\n        *   **Safety Check:**\n            *   *Own Body:* Safe.\n            *   *Enemy Body:* The enemy occupies (0,6) as a body segment. (1,6) is adjacent to (0,6), but not occupied. However, the enemy head is at (0,2).\n        *   **Collision Prediction:**\n            *   Can the enemy head move to (1,6)? Manhattan distance $|0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5$. No.\n            *   Can the enemy head move into (1,6) if I move there? The enemy is currently far away. This seems safe immediately.\n        *   **Result:** SAFE, but slightly more cramped than UP or RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Option 4: DOWN (to 2, 5)**\n        *   **Immediate Check:** Is (2, 5) an apple? No.\n        *   **Safety Check:**\n            *   *Own Body:* My body segment (2, 5) is currently the neck. Moving down into (2, 5) is moving directly backward into my own body.\n            *   *Rule:* \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n        *   **Result:** DEADLY. Eliminated.\n\n3.  **Comparison and Strategy:**\n    *   Moving **UP** allows me to eat an apple immediately, increasing my score to 5 (closing the gap with the enemy's 8).\n    *   Moving **UP** positions me at (2, 7), from which I can access the cluster of apples at (1, 7), (3, 5), (4, 6), etc.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 6) is safe but misses the apple at (2, 7).\n    *   Moving **LEFT** is safe but misses the apple.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** is suicide.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n    The move UP is safe, scores a point, and advances my position towards the upper board apples. It is the optimal move.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current state, my head is at (2, 7) and I have an apple directly below me at (2, 6). However, the board state shows my head at (2, 7) but the visual board shows '1' at (2, 7) which is consistent. Wait, let me re-examine the coordinates carefully.\n\nBoard state shows:\nRow 7: T A 1 . . . . . . .\nThis means (0,7) is T (enemy tail), (1,7) is A (apple), (2,7) is 1 (my head), (3,7) is empty.\n\nMy snake ID 1:\nHead: (2, 7)\nBody: [(2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4)]\n\nEnemy snake #0:\nHead: (1, 2)\nBody: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)]\n\nApples at: (8, 3), (1, 7), (4, 6), (6, 3), (9, 5), (8, 2), (4, 1), (5, 3), (9, 8), (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (6, 4), (3, 5), (5, 4)\n\nI need to consider my next move from head (2, 7):\n\n1. **UP to (2, 8)**: Check apples - (2, 8) is not in the apple list. Is it safe? My body is at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). No conflict. Enemy body is at x=0 and (1,2). (2,8) is safe from enemy body. However, I should check if there's an apple at (1,7) or (3,5) which are nearby.\n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 6)**: This is an apple! (2, 6) is in the apple list. But wait, (2, 6) is currently my second body segment. If I move down to (2, 6), that's moving into my own body, which would kill me. Even though there's an apple there, I can't move into my own body. So DOWN is fatal.\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 7)**: This is an apple! (1, 7) is in the apple list. Check safety: (1, 7) is not in my body (my body is at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)). Enemy body is at x=0, so (1,7) is safe from enemy body. The enemy head is at (1, 2), which is far away and cannot reach (1, 7) in one move (Manhattan distance 5). So LEFT to (1, 7) is safe and would eat an apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 7)**: Check apples - (3, 7) is not in the apple list. Safety: (3, 7) is not in my body (my body is at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)). Enemy body is at x=0, so (3,7) is safe. Enemy head is far away. So RIGHT is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n\nComparing options:\n- UP: Safe, no apple\n- DOWN: Fatal (into own body)\n- LEFT: Safe, eats apple at (1, 7)\n- RIGHT: Safe, no apple\n\nLEFT is clearly the best move - it's safe and gains an apple. This would increase my apples to 5, getting me closer to the enemy's 8.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider simultaneous movement. Could the enemy snake move in a way that causes collision? The enemy head is at (1, 2). To collide with my head at (1, 7) after I move there, the enemy would need to move to (1, 7) as well. That's a Manhattan distance of 5 (|1-1| + |2-7| = 5), which is impossible in one move. So no head-on collision risk.\n\nCould the enemy move into my body? My body will be at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) after I move. The enemy is at (1,2), far away. No immediate risk.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the optimal move - safe and gains an apple.\n\nMy long-term plan: Continue securing apples while avoiding the enemy. The enemy is confined to the left edge (x=0 and x=1), so I have the right side mostly to myself. I should work towards the cluster of apples on the right side (like (8,3), (6,4), etc.) while being careful not to get trapped.\n\nLEFT",

My body is at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). (2,8) is not in my body.  \n- Is it enemy body? Enemy body is along x=0 (and (1,2)). (2,8) is safe.  \n- Is there an apple? (2,8) is not in the apple list.  \n- Safe, but no apple.\n\n**DOWN to (2, 6):**  \n- On board: Yes.  \n- Is it my own body? My body includes (2,6) as the second segment. Moving into my own body is fatal.  \n- Even though there's an apple at (2,6), I cannot eat it because it's currently my body. Moving there would kill me.  \n- **Fatal**.\n\n**LEFT to (1, 7):**  \n- On board: Yes.  \n- Is it my own body? My body is at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). (1,7) is not in my body.  \n- Is it enemy body? Enemy body is at x=0 (and (1,2)). (1,7) is not in enemy body.  \n- Is there an apple? Yes, (1,7) is in the apple list!  \n- Safety check: Enemy head is at (1,2). To collide head-on, enemy would need to move to (1,7) this turn, which is impossible (distance 5).  \n- **Safe and gains an apple**.\n\n**RIGHT to (3, 7):**  \n- On board: Yes.  \n- Is it my own body? My body is at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). (3,7) is not in my body.  \n- Is it enemy body? No.  \n- Is there an apple? (3,7) is not in the apple list.  \n- Safe, but no apple.\n\nComparing safe moves: LEFT gives an apple, UP and RIGHT are safe but no immediate gain. LEFT is clearly optimal for score increase. The enemy is confined to the left side (x \u2264 1) and cannot reach (1,7) this turn. After eating, I'll have 6 apples, still behind Snake #0 but closing the gap.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating at (1,7), move toward the right side where there are many apples (e.g., (8,3), (6,4), (7,9)). Avoid getting trapped by the enemy on the left. Maintain escape routes.\n\nLEFT",
