The apple at (0,0) is far to the left and not immediately reachable\n2. The apple at (0,3) is far to the left and not immediately reachable\n3. The apple at (0,5) is far to the left and not immediately reachable\n4. The apple at (5,5) is in the center and not immediately reachable\n5. The apple at (8,3) is directly above me and reachable\n\nSafe moves analysis:\n- UP: (4,1) - my own body, unsafe\n- DOWN: (4,-1) - off the board, unsafe\n- LEFT: (3,0) - my own body, unsafe\n- RIGHT: (5,0) - my own body, unsafe\n\nWait a minute, this is concerning. All four directions appear to be unsafe based on my current position and body. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the board representation:\nRow 0: A . T T 1 T T T T T\nThis shows my head at (4,0) with body segments at (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), etc.\n\nSo:\n- UP from (4,0) would be (4,1) - which is marked as T (my body) in row 1\n- DOWN from (4,0) would be (4,-1) - off the board\n- LEFT from (4,0) would be (3,0) - which is marked as T (my body) in row 0\n- RIGHT from (4,0) would be (5,0) - which is marked as T (my body) in row 0\n\nThis appears to be a critical situation where I'm completely surrounded by my own body. However, this seems impossible since I just moved LEFT last turn from (5,0) to (4,0), and (4,0) should have been empty at that time.\n\nLet me re-examine the board state more carefully. Looking at the board representation again:\n\nRow 0: A . T T 1 T T T T T\nThis shows:\n- (0,0): A (apple)\n- (1,0): . (empty)\n- (2,0): T (my body)\n- (3,0): T (my body)\n- (4,0): 1 (my head)\n- (5,0): T (my body)\n- etc.\n\nSo my head is at (4,0), and my body is at (5,0), (6,0), etc. to the right, and also at (3,0), (2,0), etc. to the left.\n\nThis means I'm indeed completely boxed in by my own body. There are no safe moves available. This appears to be a fatal situation where I will die this turn regardless of what move I choose.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any possible interpretation where a move might be safe:\n\n1. UP to (4,1): Looking at row 1: . T . . . . . . . T\n   - (4,1) is . (empty) in row 1\n   Wait, this contradicts my earlier analysis! Let me look more carefully.\n\nRow 1: . T . . . . . . . T\nThis shows:\n- (0,1): .\n- (1,1): T\n- (2,1): .\n- (3,1): .\n- (4,1): .\n- etc.\n\nSo (4,1) is actually empty! My earlier analysis was incorrect. I thought (4,1) was my body because I saw T in row 1, but that T is at (1,1), not (4,1).\n\nLet me re-analyze all moves:\n\n1. UP: (4,0) \u2192 (4,1)\n   - Looking at row 1, column 4: . (empty)\n   - This is safe!\n\n2. DOWN: (4,0) \u2192 (4,-1)\n   - Off the board, unsafe\n\n3. LEFT: (4,0) \u2192 (3,0)\n   - Looking at row 0, column 3: T (my body)\n   - Unsafe\n\n4. RIGHT: (4,0) \u2192 (5,0)\n   - Looking at row 0, column 5: T (my body)\n   - Unsafe\n\nSo UP is actually the only safe move available!\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. Moving UP gets me out of the immediate danger zone\n2. It moves me toward the center of the board where there are apples\n3. The enemy snake is far above me and not an immediate threat\n4. This move keeps me alive and gives me options for future turns\n\nBest move: UP to escape the immediate danger and move toward the center of the board.\n\nUP",
