There is risk of head-on interaction, but there\u2019s no guaranteed death from this choice.\n- The apple at (8,9) is directly ahead; advancing to (8,8) keeps you on a path to eat it next turn, while preserving maneuverability.\n\nPlan:\n- Move UP to (8,8) now, then reassess next turn to continue toward the apple at (8,9) if safe; otherwise adjust to the next closest safe apple while avoiding traps and enemy movement.\n\nUP",
