Remove RIGHT.  \n\nSo RIGHT is invalid.  \n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safety from enemy head movement**  \nEnemy head at (2,6), possible moves: UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), RIGHT to (3,6). No overlap with my possible moves this turn \u2014 no risk of head-to-head collision this turn.  \n\nAlso, my minimal length means enemy cannot run into my body.  \n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future options**  \nClosest apples: (5,5) is closer in Manhattan distance (|9-5| + |4-5| = 4+1=5) than others except (0,4), but that\u2019s further away in steps.  \n\nActually (0,4) is same y but x distance 9 \u2014 far.  \n\nWe should aim to move toward center to have more options. Moving LEFT (8,4) and UP (9,5) both go toward center-ish area; UP goes slightly closer to apple (5,5), but DOWN goes away from most apples.  \n\nLet\u2019s think ahead:  \nFrom (9,4):\n- If I go LEFT to (8,4), next turn options: can go UP, DOWN, LEFT (but not RIGHT into my tail since no length). OK.  \n- If I go UP to (9,5), next turn options: LEFT, DOWN, UP (but not RIGHT off board). Actually UP then next turn can only go LEFT or DOWN (since RIGHT out, UP possible but may reduce options later).  \n\nComparing: (8,4) is better \u2014 more central, away from edge.  \n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan idea**  \nApple at (5,5) is a good target in a few moves. Need to avoid enemy, who is currently far away. Enemy may go for (3,8) apple first. I should plot a path through middle rows rather than hugging edges to keep options open.  \n\n**Decision**: LEFT puts me in a safer, more flexible position than UP or DOWN, without being farther from apples.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, it had apple count 1 last turn and head at (3,8) now, so it must have eaten the apple and grown. Therefore, its body should now be two segments: head at (3,8) and tail at (3,7)? But the state says \"Body: [(3,7)]\" \u2014 this might be a typo or misrepresentation. Let me check the board: at row 8, (3,8) has \"1\" (head), and at row 7, (3,7) has \"T\" (tail). So after eating, the body should extend. Probably the body list is outdated. To be safe, assume snake #1 has head at (3,8) and body including (3,7) and possibly a new segment? Actually, when you eat, you grow by one at the tail. So if it had body [(3,7)] and ate, the new body would be [(3,8), (3,7)] and the tail is still (3,7) until next move? No: after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately. So the body is now longer: head at (3,8), then the previous head (3,7) becomes the neck, and the tail (3,7) remains? This is confusing.\n\nGiven the board shows \"T\" at (3,7), it means the tail is there. So snake #1 has head at (3,8) and tail at (3,7). So it has one body segment. The enemy snakes list says \"Body: [(3,7)]\", which is correct: the segment behind the head.\n\nAnyway, snake #1 is far away (Manhattan distance |6-3|+|4-8|=3+4=7), so no immediate threat.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and route planning**\nApples: (0,4), (6,0), (1,0), (5,5), (8,6)\n\nClosest apple to (6,4) is (5,5): distance |6-5|+|4-5|=1+1=2.\nAlso (8,6) is |6-8|+|4-6|=2+2=4.\n(6,0) is |6-6|+|4-0|=0+4=4.\n(0,4) and (1,0) are farther.\n\nSo (5,5) is very close. To reach it:\n- UP: (6,5) then LEFT to (5,5) next turn.\n- LEFT: (5,4) then UP to (5,5) next turn.\n- DOWN or RIGHT would increase distance.\n\nSo both UP and LEFT are equally good for reaching (5,5) in two moves.\n\nWhich one is better? Consider future mobility after eating.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,4), then UP to (5,5) to eat. After eating, I will have a body at (5,4). Then from (5,5), I can go to nearby apples: (6,0) is south, (8,6) is northeast.\nIf I go UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5) to eat. Then from (5,5), same situation.\n\nBut going LEFT first might be slightly better because (5,4) is closer to (6,0) for later, and also avoids potential congestion? No real difference.\n\nAlso, apple (6,0) is directly below me. If I go DOWN to (6,3), then further DOWN, I can get it in 3 moves: (6,3)->(6,2)->(6,1)->(6,0). But that is longer than getting (5,5) in 2 moves.\n\nSo prioritize (5,5).\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan note**\nAfter eating (5,5), consider going for (6,0) or (8,6). Snake #1 is in the top left, so avoid that area for now. From (5,5), I can go DOWN to (5,4) then further down toward (6,0), or RIGHT to (6,5) then to (8,6). Since (6,0) is closer (distance 5) than (8,6) (distance 5 as well, but more open path), but (6,0) is in the bottom row which might be safer from enemy.\n\nAlso, snake #1 might go for (0,4) next, so I should avoid top left.\n\nFor now, move toward (5,5).\n\nTie between LEFT and UP. I'll choose LEFT to (5,4) to be one step away horizontally, and then next turn I can go UP to eat.\n\nLEFT",

Actually, last move I was at (6,4) and moved LEFT to (5,4). The board shows my head at (5,4) and an apple at (5,5) is gone? Let's check the board: at (5,5) there is \"A\" but it should be gone if I ate it? Wait, no: I moved from (6,4) to (5,4) - that is not (5,5). So I did not eat an apple last turn. The apple at (5,5) is still there.\n\nCorrecting: after moving LEFT from (6,4) to (5,4), I am now at (5,4). The apple at (5,5) is still present. I have no body (still length 1).\n\nApples: (0,4), (6,0), (1,0), (5,5), (8,6) \u2014 all still there? Actually, snake #1 ate one earlier, but the list shows all apples? The apple list might be updated? The board shows \"A\" at (5,5), so it is there.\n\nSo current head: (5,4). Possible moves:\n- UP: (5,5) \u2014 has an apple! So if I go UP, I eat the apple and grow to length 2 (with body at (5,4)).\n- DOWN: (5,3) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (4,4) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,4) \u2014 empty (I was there two turns ago, but now empty), safe.\n\nAll moves are safe (no self-body, no enemies nearby).\n\nSnake #1 is at head (4,8) with body [(3,8)]? Actually, the state says head (4,8) and body [(3,8)] - so it moved from (3,8) to (4,8) last turn? And it has apple count 1. It might be chasing other apples. Distance to me: |5-4|+|4-8|=1+4=5, so not immediate threat.\n\nBest move: UP to (5,5) to eat the apple. This is optimal because it is adjacent and gives me my first apple. After eating, I will have a body segment at (5,4), so I need to avoid going backwards (DOWN from (5,5) to (5,4)) in the future.\n\nNext turn after eating, from (5,5) I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? But DOWN would be into my own body (at (5,4)), so that would be fatal. So I must avoid DOWN next turn. Therefore, after eating, I have three moves: UP (to (5,6)), LEFT (to (4,5)), RIGHT (to (6,5)).\n\nSo going UP now is safe and gets the apple.\n\nOther moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) do not get the apple and might delay.\n\nTherefore, choose UP.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nLast move I went LEFT to (5,4) to position for the apple at (5,5). Now I can eat it by moving UP. This gives me my first apple and grows to length 2. After eating, avoid moving DOWN into my new body at (5,4). Next, from (5,5), consider moving towards (8,6) or (6,0). Snake #1 is at (4,8) and may be heading for (0,4) or other apples. I should avoid top-left. Possibly go RIGHT to (6,5) then towards (8,6), or LEFT to (4,5) then down? But (6,0) is also an option.

My body is at (5,6).  \nApples: (0,4), (6,0), (1,0), (8,6), (0,9)  \nSnake #1: head (7,8), body (6,8).  \n\n**Safety check from (5,7):**  \n- UP: (5,8) \u2014 currently Snake #1's body? Wait, Snake #1's body is at (6,8), so (5,8) is empty. But Snake #1 might move there? No, movement is simultaneous. So (5,8) is free at start of turn. However, Snake #1 could move into (5,8) this turn? Snake #1 head at (7,8): moves possible: UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8) (its own body \u274c), RIGHT (8,8). So Snake #1 cannot go LEFT (into its own body). So (6,8) is blocked for Snake #1. Therefore, Snake #1 can only go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. It cannot go to (5,8). So (5,8) is safe from Snake #1 this turn.  \nBut also, if I go UP to (5,8), is that safe? It is not occupied by any snake at start. So yes, safe.  \n- DOWN: (5,6) \u2014 my own body \u274c (fatal)  \n- LEFT: (4,7) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT: (6,7) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n\nSo possible safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is fatal.\n\n**Apple priorities:**  \nClosest apple is (8,6) at Manhattan distance |5-8| + |7-6| = 3+1 = 4.  \nRIGHT (to (6,7)) reduces distance to (8,6) to |6-8| + |7-6| = 2+1 = 3.  \nUP (to (5,8)) increases distance to (8,6) to |5-8| + |8-6| = 3+2 = 5.  \nLEFT (to (4,7)) increases distance to (8,6) to |4-8| + |7-6| = 4+1 = 5.  \nSo RIGHT is best for approaching (8,6).\n\n**Snake #1 considerations:**  \nSnake #1 head at (7,8). It can only go UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7), or RIGHT (8,8). It cannot go LEFT (into its own body at (6,8)).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7), Snake #1 might go DOWN to (7,7). Then our heads would be adjacent: me at (6,7), Snake #1 at (7,7). Next turn, if I go RIGHT to (7,7) and Snake #1 goes LEFT to (6,7), head-on collision occurs. So that is a risk.  \nAlternatively, if Snake #1 goes DOWN to (7,7), and I am at (6,7), we are not colliding this turn. But next turn we might collide.  \nHowever, Snake #1 might not go DOWN: it could go UP or RIGHT. So it's not certain.\n\n**Future flexibility from (6,7):**  \nFrom (6,7), possible moves: UP (6,8) \u2014 currently Snake #1's body? But Snake #1 will move, so (6,8) might become free. However, if Snake #1 goes DOWN to (7,7), then (6,8) becomes free. Then I could go UP to (6,8) safely. Or DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7) (which is now my tail? Actually, my body will be at (5,7) and (5,6), so (5,7) is occupied next turn? Wait: after I move to (6,7), my new body will be: head (6,7), then (5,7), then (5,6). So (5,7) is occupied. So from (6,7), LEFT to (5,7) is fatal (my own body). So only safe moves from (6,7) would be UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), RIGHT (7,7). But RIGHT (7,7) might be occupied by Snake #1 if it goes DOWN. So it's a bit constrained.\n\n**Alternative: UP to (5,8)**  \nUP to (5,8) is safe (as established). From there, distance to (8,6) is larger, but also closer to (0,9).  \nFrom (5,8), possible moves: UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7) (my body? After move, body is (5,8), (5,7), (5,6) \u2014 so (5,7) is occupied), LEFT (4,8), RIGHT (6,8).  \nSo only UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.  \nRIGHT (6,8) is currently Snake #1's body, but Snake #1 will move. If Snake #1 goes UP, DOWN, or RIGHT, (6,8) becomes free. So it might be safe next turn.  \nThis move avoids immediate adjacency with Snake #1.\n\n**Balancing risk and reward:**  \nRIGHT (6,7) is more direct to the apple but risks future head-on with Snake #1.  \nUP (5,8) is safer from Snake #1 but moves away from the closest apple.  \nLEFT (4,7) moves away from both apples and Snake #1.\n\nGiven that Snake #1 has multiple options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) and might not go DOWN, RIGHT is acceptable. Also, if I go RIGHT and Snake #1 goes DOWN, I can avoid collision next turn by not going RIGHT again? For example, if I am at (6,7) and Snake #1 at (7,7), I can go UP to (6,8) (if free) or DOWN to (6,6). So it's manageable.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:**  \nGo RIGHT to (6,7) to approach (8,6). Then assess Snake #1's position. If Snake #1 is at (7,7), avoid going RIGHT to (7,7) next turn; instead go UP or DOWN. If Snake #1 is elsewhere, proceed toward (8,6) via (7,7) or (6,6) then (7,6), etc.\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT",

Moving **LEFT** to (4,0) is the direct continuation of this plan, bringing me closer to the nearest apple at (3,0). This is the primary objective.\nMoving **UP** to (5,1) would be a detour from this primary goal, taking me away from the immediate target. While it isn't fatal, it delays collecting a readily available apple without a clear reason.\n\n**Enemy Considerations:**\nThe enemy is at (4,4). It is moving south, likely towards the apple at (3,0) itself. Moving LEFT directly challenges it for this apple. However, since we are on different rows (y=0 vs y=4) and the enemy is 4 moves away vertically (even if it moves directly down each turn, it would take 4 turns to reach y=0), there is a low probability of a head-on collision at (3,0) on the same turn. This risk is acceptable.\n\n**Future Options:**\n*   **If LEFT (4,0):** From there, my next safe moves would be LEFT again (to (3,0) for the apple) or UP (to (4,1)). This maintains excellent future flexibility and directly serves the plan.\n*   **If UP (5,1):** From there, my next moves could be LEFT or RIGHT. However, my body blocks the path back down to the bottom row where the apples are. This could potentially lead to a dead end on the upper rows where fewer apples are located.\n\n**Final Decision:** LEFT is the optimal move. It directly executes the long-term plan by moving me towards the nearest apple, maintains future flexibility, and presents an acceptable, low level of risk from the enemy. Moving UP is a safe but less productive alternative.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nContinue executing the plan: move west along y=0. Next turn, plan to move LEFT again to (3,0) to eat the apple. Afterward, decide whether to continue left towards (1,0) or move north to target (0,4). The enemy may be competing for (3,0), so be aware of its potential to move south rapidly.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

From its position at (3,4), the fastest path is DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. Since we move simultaneously, if we both move directly towards (3,0) for three turns, we would collide on turn 4. However, there's a chance the enemy changes direction before then. The risk is too high to take a direct path into a potential head-on collision. Avoiding this is the top priority.\n\n**Strategy Adjustment:**\nSince the only immediately safe move is UP, I must take it. This is a tactical retreat from the direct confrontation over the apple at (3,0). My new short-term goal is to survive and find an alternative path to an apple. From (4,1), I can consider moving left towards the apple at (0,4) by navigating the top of the board, or look for opportunities to safely descend later. This move keeps me alive and opens up the board, avoiding a likely death trap on the bottom row.\n\n**Future Options from UP (4,1):**\nNext turn, my head will be at (4,1). From there, I can assess moving LEFT (3,1), RIGHT (5,1), or UP (4,2).

It ensures my survival and allows me to regroup.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nThe direct path to (3,0) is blocked by the enemy. New plan: Move UP to (4,1) to avoid conflict. Next, consider moving left along y=1 or y=2 to approach the apple at (0,4) from a safer angle. Monitor the enemy's movement; if it eats the apple at (3,0) and moves away, the bottom row may become safe again. Prioritize survival and seeking alternative apple routes over direct confrontation.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",

This continues my efficient path along the bottom row.\n- **UP (3,1):** This move moves away from the easily accessible apple at (2,0). It doesn't provide any immediate benefit and could lead to a less straightforward pathing situation later.\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk?** The enemy is 8 cells away (Manhattan distance from (3,0) to (1,9) = |3-1| + |0-9| = 2+9=11). There is no collision risk this turn from the enemy.\n\n**Best Option:**\nLEFT to (2,0) is the clear best choice. It is safe, immediate progress towards an apple, and follows my established long-term plan.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nCurrent Path: Collect the apple at (2,0) this turn.\nNext Turn: From (2,0), the next leftward move to (1,0) collects another apple. After securing the bottom-row apples, the plan is to move north towards the apple cluster at (0,4) and (1,1). Continue to monitor the enemy's position, though they remain far away on the top row.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

This is a short, direct path to two apples.\n*   **RIGHT (2,1):** Moves me east. This path eventually leads to the cluster of apples, but it's a longer route. My body is also on row 0, so moving east on row 1 creates a temporary barrier and might lead to a trap later.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nThe enemy is still far away at (0,7) and unlikely to interfere with my path to (0,3) or (0,4). The move to (0,1) is the most direct and least risky path to immediate apple collection. The move UP is also safe and opens up future options. RIGHT is safe but less optimal.\n\n**Immediate Choice:**\nLEFT is the best move. It directly targets the closest available apples (0,3) and (0,4) and is not immediately risky.

Moving right places my head at (6,6), which is adjacent to the apple at (7,6) and keeps my options open for the next turn (I could continue right to eat that apple or go up toward the (6,8) apples). It does not conflict with any part of my own body, and the enemy cannot reach (6,6) this turn, so there is no risk of a head\u2011on collision. This move therefore best balances safety, progress toward an apple, and preservation of future maneuverability.  \nRIGHT",

My goal remains to navigate towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (9,6). Moving DOWN is fatal. The enemy is at (5,6), which is two cells diagonally away (UP+LEFT from me). There is no immediate threat of a head-on collision from any of my safe moves. Moving UP to (6,5) is the most direct path towards the apples. Moving RIGHT to (7,4) is also a good option that moves me away from the enemy and opens up future paths. Moving LEFT to (5,4) is safe but moves me closer to the enemy's head and body, which is a higher-risk area. The primary objective is to ascend safely towards the apples while maintaining distance from the enemy.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove UP to (6,5). From there, the goal is to continue navigating upwards and rightwards towards the apples. Potential paths from (6,5):\n1.  UP to (6,6) to get closer to the apples at (6,8) and (7,6).\n2.  RIGHT to (7,5) to approach the center-right area.\n3.  LEFT to (5,5) is likely blocked by the enemy's body, so avoid it.\nThe enemy's position at (5,6) is a concern. Avoid moving into its path.

My goal is to collect apples while avoiding the enemy snake, which is currently positioned above me. The enemy's head is at (7,7). From there, it can move UP to (7,8) (apple), DOWN to (7,6), LEFT to (6,7), or RIGHT to (8,7). Moving UP to (8,6) brings me closer to the apple cluster at (7,8) and (6,8), but also potentially closer to the enemy's path. Moving RIGHT to (9,5) moves me towards the right edge and the apple at (9,6), but also into a corner which could limit future options. Moving DOWN to (8,4) moves me away from the apples and into a safer, more open area. The most aggressive and rewarding move is UP, directly towards the apples. However, I must consider the enemy's potential moves. If the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), it would be adjacent to (8,6), creating a high-risk zone for a head-on collision on the next turn. Moving RIGHT to (9,5) is a safer alternative that still progresses towards an apple (9,6) and keeps me on the edge, potentially boxing in the enemy later. Moving DOWN is safe but unproductive.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove RIGHT to (9,5). This secures a position on the right edge. From (9,5), the next move can be UP to (9,6) to claim the apple, which is a high-priority target. This path avoids moving directly into the enemy's most likely path (downwards from (7,7)) and minimizes the risk of a head-on collision on the next turn. After claiming (9,6), the plan is to navigate upwards towards the other apples (7,8) and (6,8), using the edge of the board for safety.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT\n**END RATIONALE**",

My body segments are at: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3)].\nApples are at: (9, 3), (0, 1), (8, 4), (7, 2), (0, 0).\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (6, 9). Its body is long and runs along the top-left edge.\n\n**Safety Check from (8,6):**\n*   **UP (8,7):** Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **DOWN (8,5):** My own body segment. \u274c Fatal.\n*   **LEFT (7,6):** Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (9,6):** My own body segment. \u274c Fatal.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Risk Assessment and Goal:**\nMy successful LEFT move last turn has moved me away from the dangerous top-right corner. My current position offers two safe options: UP (8,7) and LEFT (7,6). Moving DOWN or RIGHT is fatal due to my own body.\nThe apple at (8,4) is now directly below me. However, DOWN is blocked by my own body. I cannot reach it directly this turn.\nMoving UP (8,7) is safe and positions me near the top edge. From (8,7), my next moves could be LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7), or DOWN (8,6). However, (8,6) will be occupied by my body next turn, and (9,7) is a corner. This move risks limiting my future options and potentially trapping me again.\nMoving LEFT (7,6) is the superior strategic choice. It moves me away from the crowded right side of the board and towards the center. From (7,6), I will have more flexibility next turn. The apple at (7,2) becomes a more viable target, requiring a path DOWN and LEFT. The enemy snake's head is at (6,9), which is not an immediate threat to this path. My priority is to maintain maneuverability and navigate towards the available apples while avoiding the enemy's long body.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove LEFT to (7,6) to continue moving into the center of the board and increase future move options. From there, plan a route towards the apples at (7,2) or (8,4). Be cautious of the enemy snake's position at (6,9); its long body creates a hazard zone on the left side of the board. Avoid moving directly towards its head to prevent a potential head-on collision. The goal is to safely extend my length while keeping escape routes open.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT\n**END RATIONALE**",
