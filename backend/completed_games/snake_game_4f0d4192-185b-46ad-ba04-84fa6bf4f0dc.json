One_INPUT moves would allow me to claim more points by getting to other apples, and two_INPUT guarantee I have the flexibility to move around.\n\nBut what about getting near positions where I could pick up multiple apples at once? Moving UP would give me a range of possibilities, rather than committing to a specific target.\n\nThinking ahead and trying to feel my way through the board gives me the idea to claim multiple apples with strategizing ahead. Moving UP seems to maintain an open approach and doesn't give me risky commitments.\n\nYou know what I need after getting the snake at a decent distance from the enemy?

In this case, none immediately come to mind, but with the apple placement, the enemy snake's current location, and my current position, I can see some constraints to keep in mind.\n\nFor now, I'm thinking: If I get the chance to sneak up and get close to the (6, 8) and (9, 6) apples, that could give me valuable leverage.
