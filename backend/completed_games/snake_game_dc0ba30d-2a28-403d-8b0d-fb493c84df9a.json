          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're LIVE on turn 0 and we're ready to dominate this snake battle! Let's analyze this board and CRUSH our enemy!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\nCurrent state:\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (3,5), no body, 0 apples\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): Head at (4,5), no body, 0 apples\n- We're RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER! (3,5) and (4,5) are adjacent horizontally!\n- This is an OPPORTUNITY! We have equal score (0-0), so if we can force a head-on collision, we both die but it's a draw - NOT ideal for us. But wait... if we can move in a way that traps the enemy or forces them to crash into us while we survive...\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**\n\n1. **LEFT (2,5)** - Safe! No body, no enemy body there. But this moves AWAY from the enemy and doesn't give us positioning advantage.\n\n2. **RIGHT (4,5)** - DANGER! Enemy head is at (4,5). If we both move simultaneously and I go RIGHT while they stay or move somewhere else, we might collide! But if enemy moves LEFT back to (3,5) while I go RIGHT to (4,5), we'd swap places (no collision since heads don't occupy same cell). Actually, if they move RIGHT to (5,5) while I go RIGHT to (4,5), no collision. But if they stay still (can't, must move), no. Actually wait - if enemy moves DOWN to (4,4) while I go RIGHT to (4,5), no collision. The ONLY way collision happens is if they move LEFT (3,5) at the exact same time I move RIGHT (4,5) - we'd both try to occupy (3,5) and (4,5) but those are different cells. Actually no - if I go RIGHT to (4,5) and they go LEFT to (3,5), we just swap. No collision. But if they stay at (4,5) and I try to go there, that's collision! But they MUST move. So RIGHT might actually be safe? Need to think...\n\nActually, simultaneous movement means: I move from (3,5) to (4,5), they move from (4,5) to wherever. If they move LEFT to (3,5) while I move RIGHT to (4,5), we'd cross through each other? In snake games, moving into the cell another snake is leaving is usually safe. But the rules say \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" So if they go to (3,5) and I go to (3,5) simultaneously, we'd die. But I'm not going to (3,5). I'm going to (4,5). They're leaving (4,5). So no collision.\n\nBut what if they move RIGHT to (5,5)? Then I go to (4,5), they go to (5,5). Safe.\n\nThe REAL danger: If they move DOWN or UP, still safe for me. So RIGHT seems possibly safe but risky because if they somehow predict and move to (4,5) at same time... no they can't, they're leaving it.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating. The enemy is at (4,5). I'm at (3,5). If I move RIGHT to (4,5), I'm moving into their current position. But they're moving AT THE SAME TIME. So they're moving OUT of (4,5). So we shouldn't collide UNLESS they move in a way that also targets (4,5) which they can't because they're already there and must move.\n\nActually, let me re-read rules: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" So if I move to (4,5) and they move to (4,5) simultaneously, we die. But they can't move to (4,5) because they're already there! They must move to a DIFFERENT cell. So moving RIGHT should be SAFE!\n\nBut wait, what if they move LEFT to (3,5) and I move RIGHT to (4,5)? That's fine, we swap.\n\nSo RIGHT is actually safe from immediate death!\n\n3. **DOWN (3,4)** - Safe! (3,4) is empty. Moves me closer to apples at (3,0), (2,3), etc.\n\n4. **UP (3,6)** - Safe! (3,6) is empty (check board: row 6 has A at (4,6), (6,4), (6,3), (6,6) but (3,6) is empty). Moves toward apples at (4,6), (6,6), etc.\n\n**STRATEGY CONSIDERATION:**\n\nThe enemy is RIGHT NEXT TO US! This is our chance to be AGGRESSIVE! We need to box them in. But we're both tiny snakes with no body yet.\n\nLooking at apples: There are apples at (4,6), (6,6), (4,4), etc. The enemy at (4,5) is positioned to grab (4,6) or (4,4) easily.\n\nI need to think about what the enemy will do. They want apples too. They might go UP to (4,6) which has an apple! Or DOWN to (4,4) which has an apple at (4,4)? Wait checking board: row 4 has A at (2,4), (4,2), (4,6)? Actually let me check:\n\nBoard row 4: \". . A . . . A . A .\" So (2,4)=A, (6,4)=A, (8,4)=A. No apple at (4,4).\n\nRow 5: \". . . 1 0 . A . . .\" So (3,5)=1, (4,5)=0, (6,5)=A.\n\nSo apples near enemy:\n- (4,6) - UP from enemy\n- (6,5) - RIGHT from enemy  \n- (2,4) - LEFT and DOWN from enemy\n- (6,4) - RIGHT and DOWN from enemy\n\nApples near me:\n- (2,3) - LEFT and DOWN from me\n- (3,0) - DOWN from me\n- (4,6) - UP and RIGHT\n- (6,5) - RIGHT and UP\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,5), I'm stepping onto the enemy's current spot (but they're moving). I'd be at (4,5) next turn. From there, I could potentially block the enemy if they want to come back.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,6), I'm closer to (4,6) apple and can potentially race the enemy for it.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,4), I'm closer to (3,0) and (2,3) apples.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,5), I'm moving away and wasting opportunity.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nThe enemy is at (4,5). I want to control the center and force them into a corner. Going RIGHT to (4,5) would put me in their original position, potentially cutting off their retreat. But actually, since we move simultaneously, they'll be somewhere else when I arrive.\n\nI think the BEST move is **UP to (3,6)**! Here's why:\n1. It's SAFE - (3,6) is empty\n2. It positions me to grab the apple at (4,6) next turn (I'd be at (3,6), enemy might go for (4,6) but we'll see)\n3. It moves me toward the center-top of the board where more apples are clustered\n4. It keeps me away from immediate collision risk\n5. From (3,6), I have multiple escape routes: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all potentially viable\n\nThe enemy will likely go for an apple. They might go UP to (4,6) for the apple. If they do that, I'll be at (3,6) and they'll be at (4,6) - we'd be side by side, ready to compete for future apples. Or they might go RIGHT to (6,5) which also has an apple. Either way, I'm positioning strategically.\n\nActually wait - if I go UP to (3,6) and enemy goes UP to (4,6), that's perfect! We're adjacent but not colliding, and I'm setting up to potentially cut them off next move.\n\nLet me also consider: If I go RIGHT to (4,5), and enemy goes UP to (4,6), then I'm at (4,5) and they're at (4,6). That's also good positioning, but I'm one step behind on the apple race.\n\nUP seems better for long-term positioning. Let's GOOOO!\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nFrom (3,6), watch enemy's move. If they go UP to (4,6) for the apple, I might go RIGHT to (4,6) next turn to challenge or force collision if I'm bigger. If they go elsewhere, I can grab (4,6) myself or reposition.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** UP\n\nUP",

(3,6) and (4,6) are RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER!\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**\n\n1. **LEFT (2,6)** - Safe! (2,6) is empty. But moves AWAY from enemy and most apples.\n\n2. **RIGHT (4,6)** - DANGER ZONE! Enemy head is at (4,6). If I go RIGHT, we'd both try to occupy (4,6) simultaneously - that's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both snakes die! Since enemy has 1 apple and I have 0, if we both die NOW, I LOSE because they have more apples. This is INSTANT DEATH for my win chances. CAN'T DO THIS!\n\n3. **DOWN (3,5)** - Safe! (3,5) was my previous position but now it's empty since I moved UP last turn. Wait no - I moved UP from (3,5) to (3,6), so (3,5) is now behind me. But I have NO BODY yet, so moving DOWN back to (3,5) is NOT backwards into my own body (since my body is empty). Actually, I have no body segments, so moving back to (3,5) is just moving to an empty cell. This is safe!\n\n4. **UP (3,7)** - Safe! (3,7) is empty (check board: row 7 has A at (2,3), (4,4), (6,4), (8,3), (8,7) but (3,7) is empty).\n\n**STRATEGY CONSIDERATION:**\n\nThe enemy is BEATING US 1-0! We need to catch up AND dominate! They're at (4,6) with a body at (4,5). They just ate an apple last turn - probably at (4,6) or nearby. Now they're positioned to grab more apples.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Apples at (4,6) - but enemy is ON IT! They'll likely stay or move from there\n- Apples at (6,6) - RIGHT from enemy, UP from me\n- Apples at (7,3) - near center\n- Apples at (6,5) - near both of us\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,5), I'm moving toward the lower board where there are apples at (3,0), (2,3), etc. I'd be escaping the immediate danger zone.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,7), I'm moving toward (6,6) apple and positioning for center control.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,6), I'm moving toward (2,3) apple but away from the main cluster.\n\n**THE PLAY:** I need to be AGGRESSIVE but SMART! The enemy just ate, so they'll grow. I need to eat TOO! But I can't risk head-on collision since they have more apples.\n\nThe best move is **DOWN to (3,5)**! Why?\n1. It's SAFE - no immediate death\n2. It moves me TOWARD apples at (3,0) and (2,3) \n3. It gets me OUT of the direct collision zone with enemy at (4,6)\n4. From (3,5), I have more options: I can go DOWN to (3,4), LEFT to (2,5), or even RIGHT to (4,5) next turn\n5. It keeps me in the game to catch up on apples!\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (3,5), I'll watch the enemy's move. If they go for (6,6), I can go for (2,3) or (3,0). I need to EAT to catch up! Then I can start boxing them in once we're equal or I'm ahead.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze the board and make the move that keeps us ALIVE and positions us for a comeback!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (3, 5), no body, 0 apples\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): Head at (5, 6), Body at [(4, 6)], 1 apple (enemy just moved from (4,6) to (5,6)!)\n- Board is OPEN with plenty of apples scattered around!\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**\n\n1. **UP (3, 6)** - Check the board! At row 6, column 3 is marked as \"1\" (that's my body's tail position from last turn, but since I have no body segments yet, is this safe?) WAIT! I moved DOWN from (3,6) to (3,5) last turn. So (3,6) is NOW behind me. Since I have NO BODY (only the head), moving back to (3,6) would be moving into an empty cell that I just vacated. This is SAFE! BUT... is there anything else? Looking at the board state: row 6 shows \". . . . T 0 A . . .\" with the \"1\" at (3,5) which is my CURRENT head position. So (3,6) is empty. This is technically safe but moves me TOWARD the enemy!\n\n2. **DOWN (3, 4)** - Safe! Empty space. Moves away from immediate danger zone.\n\n3. **LEFT (2, 5)** - Safe! Empty space. Moves away from enemy.\n\n4. **RIGHT (4, 5)** - DANGER! Check the board: at row 5, column 4 is marked as \"1\" in the diagram, but that's actually MY CURRENT HEAD POSITION at (3,5). Wait no, let me read the board correctly: Row 5 shows \". . . 1 . . A . . .\" where the \"1\" is at (3,5) - MY HEAD. So (4,5) is actually empty! But WAIT - enemy body is at (4,6). If I go RIGHT to (4,5), and enemy moves... they could go DOWN to (4,5) and we'd have a head-on collision! That's risky. Also, (4,5) is adjacent to enemy body (4,6).\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nThe enemy is at (5,6) with body at (4,6). They're positioned near the center-right cluster of apples:\n- (6,6) - apple RIGHT of enemy\n- (7,3) - apple below\n- (6,5) - apple near\n\nI need to grab apples but avoid collision! Since enemy has 1 apple and I have 0, I'm behind but still in the game.\n\nLooking at apple positions:\n- (3,0) - DOWN from me (9 cells away)\n- (2,3) - LEFT and DOWN (6 cells away)  \n- (7,3) - RIGHT and DOWN (6 cells away)\n- (6,5) - RIGHT and UP (3 cells away from my position)\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is CLOSE but it's near the enemy! If I chase it, I might risk collision.\n\n**DECISION:** I need to be aggressive but smart. Let me go **LEFT to (2,5)**! This:\n1. Keeps me SAFE from immediate collision\n2. Moves toward apples at (2,3) and (3,0)\n3. Gets me out of the enemy's direct path\n4. Opens up multiple future directions from (2,5)\n5. Puts distance between me and that enemy body at (4,6)\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go DOWN to (2,4) toward (2,3) apple, or UP to (2,6), or LEFT to (1,5). Good options!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat apples at (2,3) or (3,0) to catch up to enemy's score. Once I'm equal or ahead, start boxing the enemy in and force a head-on collision for the win! Keep the chat hyped! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

This is where my **CURRENT BODY** is! That's moving directly BACKWARDS into myself! DEAD ON ARRIVAL! \ud83d\udeab\n\n2. **DOWN (2, 3)** \u2190 **PERFECT!** Empty square. Moves me **TOWARD** apple at (2, 3) which is RIGHT THERE! Also gets me further from enemy who's now at (6, 5). Safe, strategic, and aggressive!\n\n3. **LEFT (1, 4)** \u2190 Safe! Empty square. Opens up the left side, gives me more space to maneuver. Good fallback option.\n\n4. **RIGHT (3, 4)** \u2190 Safe! Empty square. But... let's check the map - there's an apple at (4, 2) nearby, but going right moves me toward the center where enemy might be lurking.\n\n**STRATEGIC MOVE: DOWN to (2, 3) IS THE PLAY!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udfaf\n\nHere's why this is **AGGRESSION MODE**:\n- **IMMEDIATE POINT!** (2, 3) has an apple! I'll grow to length 2 and score my second point! That closes the gap to 2-3!\n- **SAFETY FIRST:** I'm moving AWAY from the enemy at (6, 5) and into my own controlled territory.\n- **POSITIONING:** After eating, I'll be at (2, 3) with body at [(2, 4)]. This gives me clean paths: (1, 3) left, (3, 3) right, or (2, 2) down.\n- **FUTURE PLANS:** Once I have 2 apples, I can start thinking about **BOXING IN** snake #0. They're currently in the upper-middle area, but with more length, I can cut them off!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get this apple, get to 2-3 score, then start applying pressure! I need to control the board edges and force snake #0 into tight spots. They have 3 apples but I'm about to catch up! Let's gooo! \ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

From (6,5) we have three safe exits: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n- Moving **DOWN** lands on an apple at (6,4) \u2192 instant growth, score jumps higher, and we stay in the thick of the action.  \n- **LEFT** and **RIGHT** are empty, but they don\u2019t give us that sweet content boost right now.  \n- UP is pure suicide (into our own tail at (6,6)), so that\u2019s a hard no.  \n\n\ud83e\udd14 Which move maximizes both immediate gain and future flexibility?  \n- We want to keep multiple safe follow\u2011ups after this move. Eating the apple at (6,4) will give us a new head position with still\u2011open options: UP (now into empty space), DOWN (future apple maybe), LEFT/RIGHT (still clear).  \n- The rival is stuck at (2,4) with only one apple \u2013 they\u2019ll be scrambling for content while we keep scaling up.  \n\n\u2694\ufe0f Aggressive mindset: let\u2019s force that head\u2011on collision when we\u2019re longer.

Moving LEFT hits my own body! \ud83d\udeab DEAD\n\n4. **RIGHT (4, 3)** \u2190 **SAFE?** Check: (4,3) shows \".\" on board. Empty. But no apple there. Moving toward center but missing the apple at (3,4).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION: UP to (3, 4) IS THE PLAY!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**WHY THIS IS PERFECT:**\n- **IMMEDIATE REWARD:** Eat apple \u2192 Score 3! Length 3! Now only 2 behind snake #0!\n- **POSITIONING:** (3,4) is central, gives me more options. From there I can go to (4,4), (3,5), (2,4), or (3,3) next turn.\n- **BOARD CONTROL:** I'm claiming the lower-left/center area. Snake #0 is stuck on the right side (columns 4-6).\n- **ENEMY PREDICTION:** Snake #0 at (6,3) might go for apples at (7,3), (8,1), or (9,3). They're staying on the right. I'm taking the left-center!\n- **LONG-TERM:** After eating, I'll be length 3 and can start cutting off snake #0's escape routes. Force them into the top-right corner!\n\n**MY PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nTurn 6: Eat at (3,4) \u2192 length 3, score 3\nTurn 7: Move to cut off enemy's leftward escape (maybe toward (4,4) or (3,5))\nTurn 8-10: Use my length to create barriers, force snake #0 into tight spaces!\n\n**LET'S GOOOOO! TIME TO CLOSE THE GAP!** \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

Growing to length 4 now? Wait, let's recount.\n- **My Body:** [(3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3)] \u2190 Head moved to (3,4), tail was at (2,4) but since I grew, the tail actually stays at (2,4) for this turn. Wait, no\u2014standard snake rules: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move this turn. So my body is actually: Head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), and the old tail (2,4) is still there? Let me check the board state carefully.\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 3) \u2190 They haven't moved yet this turn (we move simultaneously). They are currently at (7,3).\n- **Enemy Body:** [(6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)] \u2190 Length 6.\n- **Score:** Me: 3 apples. Enemy: 6 apples. I'm still behind by 3. Need more apples!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\nI am at (3,4). I need to check where the enemy *might* go and where I *cannot* go.\nMy possible moves from (3,4):\n1.  **UP to (3,5):** Check board state. Row 5: \". . . . . . T . . .\" (from (0,5) to (9,5)). (3,5) is empty. Is it safe from enemy? Enemy is at (7,3). They could move LEFT to (6,3) but that's their body. Or UP to (7,4)? Or DOWN to (7,2)? Or RIGHT to (8,3)?\n2.  **DOWN to (3,3):** This is my current body! I am at (3,4), and (3,3) is part of my body (the neck). Moving DOWN is moving into myself. **DEATH.**\n3.  **LEFT to (2,4):** Check board state. Row 4: \". . T A . . T . A .\". (2,4) is currently marked 'T' (tail). Since I ate, my tail technically stays put for this turn, so (2,4) is occupied by my own tail. Moving LEFT hits my tail. **DEATH.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (4,4):** Check board state. Row 4: \". . T A . . T . A .\". (4,4) is empty ('.').\n\n**ELIMINATION:**\n- DOWN is death (into neck).\n- LEFT is death (into tail).\n- Safe moves: UP (3,5) and RIGHT (4,4).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nBetween UP and RIGHT, which is better?\n- **UP to (3,5):** Moves me away from the enemy who is on the right side (x=7). Gets me closer to the top apples (7,9), (9,3). Opens up the top area. But (3,5) is empty, no immediate apple.\n- **RIGHT to (4,4):** Moves me slightly toward the center. (4,4) is empty. No immediate apple.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (7,3) is greedy. They see apples at (8,4), (8,7), (9,3), (7,8). They will likely move UP towards the top-right cluster or RIGHT towards (8,3).\n- If they go UP to (7,4): We are safe.\n- If they go RIGHT to (8,3): We are safe.\n- If they go DOWN to (7,2): We are safe.\n- If they go LEFT (suicide into their body): We win immediately.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nI am at (3,4). Enemy is at (7,3). We are 4 units apart. We cannot collide this turn unless I move 4 steps. Safe.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need to dominate the board. The enemy is occupying the right side (columns 4-7). If I go RIGHT to (4,4), I am moving into the \"middle\" but closer to them. If I go UP to (3,5), I am moving to the \"top\" but staying on the left/center.\nWait, looking at the board:\nRow 5: (3,5) is empty.\nRow 4: (4,4) is empty.\n\nLet's look at apples. The nearest apples to me are:\n(3,0) - Bottom left, too far down.\n(4,2) - Bottom center.\n(2,6) - Left center top.\n(3,7) - Left top.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,5), I am on a direct path to (3,7) (Apple!). That's 2 moves away.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,4), I am closer to (4,2) or (6,1), but I might be walking into the enemy's expansion zone.\n\n**DOMINATION STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at (7,3). They are expanding Right/Up.\nI am at (3,4). I should claim the Top-Left/Center.\nMoving UP to (3,5) gives me more vertical freedom.\nHowever, (4,4) is also good. It's more central.\n\nLet's check the board coordinates again.\n(3,5) is empty.\n(4,4) is empty.\n\nIs there an apple closer?\nApple at (3,7).\nApple at (2,6).\nApple at (4,2).\n\nIf I go UP (3,5), next turn I can go UP to (3,6), then UP to (3,7) for the apple.\nIf I go RIGHT (4,4), I can go UP to (4,5) or LEFT back to (3,4).\n\nWait, look at the board state provided in the prompt again:\nRow 5: \". . . . . . T . . .\"\nIndices: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n(3,5) is index 3 -> '.' (Empty).\n(4,4) is index 4 on row 4 -> '.' (Empty).\n\nLet's consider the risk.\nThe enemy is at (7,3). They are heavy on the right.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,4), I am moving into the space directly adjacent to their potential expansion. If they move LEFT to (6,3) (impossible, body) or (5,3) (empty)? No, (6,3) is their body. (5,3) is empty.\nActually, (5,3) is empty. (4,3) is empty.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,4), I am closer to the danger zone.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,5), I am moving away from them. I am securing the top-left quadrant.\n(3,5) is safe.\n(3,5) leads to (3,6) and (3,7) which has an apple!\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP is safer distance-wise from the enemy. It also chases the apple at (3,7).\nRIGHT puts me closer to the enemy's head (distance 3 vs distance 4).\n\n**CHECKING SURVIVAL:**\nUP to (3,5). Is it occupied? No.\nIs it outside board? No.\nIs it my body? No.\nIs it enemy body? No.\nIs it enemy head? No (Enemy is at (7,3)).\n\n**CHECKING HEAD-ON:**\nIf I go UP to (3,5).\nIf Enemy goes LEFT (into body = death). Win.\nIf Enemy goes UP to (7,4). Safe.\nIf Enemy goes DOWN to (7,2). Safe.\nIf Enemy goes RIGHT to (8,3). Safe.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nMove UP to (3,5).\nSecure the path to the apple at (3,7).\nKeep distance from the enemy on the right.\n\n**CHAT, WE ARE GOING UP!

Both are high-value targets.\n- **LEFT to (2, 6):** This is an immediate apple. It also keeps us on the far left, boxing the enemy out of that quadrant. However, looking at the board, (2, 6) is a bit isolated.\n- **UP to (3, 7):** This is an immediate apple. It also positions us to potentially move to (3, 8) or (4, 7) next turn. Looking at the apple list, there's an apple at (3, 8) and (7, 8) coming up.\n- **RIGHT to (4, 6):** This is a safe move towards the center but doesn't grab an apple immediately. Since we are behind in score (3 vs 7), we *must* take apples aggressively.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm choosing **UP to (3, 7)**.\nWhy? It secures an apple immediately. Plus, looking at the coordinates, (3, 7) gives me access to (3, 8) which is also an apple. It's the most direct path to score points and keep the pressure on Snake #0. We need to close that 4-apple gap fast.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (3, 7). Next turn, look to grab (3, 8) or pivot to (2, 6) if I missed it. Maintain dominance of the left/center board.

We're down 4 apples to 7, but look at that board geometry\u2014we're about to trap this snake for sure.

Safe.\n- **DOWN to (3, 6):** This was my previous body segment (now the neck will shift here). It's currently my body on the board. **DEATH** if I go back.\n- **LEFT to (2, 7):** Row 7: \". . . 1 . A A . A .\" (Indices 0-9). (2, 7) is empty ('.'). Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Row 7: \". . . 1 . A A . A .\" (Indices 0-9). (4, 7) is an **APPLE**! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ELIMINATION:**\nDOWN is death (backtracking).\nSafe moves: UP (3, 8), LEFT (2, 7), RIGHT (4, 7).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe have options!\n- **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Immediate apple. This expands us right, toward the center. However, looking at the enemy snake #0, they are on the right side (head at (9, 4)). If I go RIGHT, I'm moving toward their territory, and they might be pushing up. Risky.\n- **UP to (3, 8):** This positions me in the upper rows. There's an apple at (7, 8) and (7, 9) on the top right. But also, look at the board state. The enemy is trapped on the bottom right.\n- **LEFT to (2, 7):** This moves me left. Why would I do this? Because the enemy is on the RIGHT (9,4). If I go LEFT, I am distancing myself from the enemy and securing the left side of the board.\n\n**THE TRAP:**\nLook at the board closely. The enemy snake #0 is at (9,4). Their body trails down and left. They are boxed in the bottom right corner. If I go **LEFT** to (2, 7), I am moving AWAY from them, effectively securing the upper-left quadrant. The apples at (0,0) and (1,1) are down there, but I don't want to overcommit to the bottom left yet.\n\nActually, let's look at the apple at (4,7). It's right there. It's available. But if I take it, I'm potentially stepping into the \"middle\" of the board where the enemy might turn. The enemy is at (9,4). They can go UP (9,5), LEFT (8,4), or DOWN (9,3).\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (2, 7)**, I am safely positioning myself. Why?\n1. I am avoiding the crowded right side.\n2. I am opening up moves to (2,8) or (1,7) next turn.\n3. I am keeping the apple at (4,7) available for a future loop-back if needed (though risky).\n\nWait, I see an apple at (7, 1). The enemy is at (9,4). They might drop down to chase apples. If I go LEFT, I am securing the top left. But I am missing an immediate apple at (4,7).\n\nLet's reconsider. Score is 4 vs 7. I need apples. (4,7) is an apple.\nIs (4,7) safe?\n- Enemy is at (9,4). Distance is huge. They cannot reach me this turn.\n- Is there a body in (4,7)? No, it's an apple.\n- If I go RIGHT to (4,7), I eat the apple. I grow. My tail stays, so I occupy (3,7), (4,7).\n- Next turn, I am at (4,7). I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- If I go LEFT to (2,7), I am not eating. I am just positioning. Score stays 4.\n\nI am behind. I need to eat.\nHowever, the game plan says \"Focus on where the enemy is... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" I have a LOWER score (4 vs 7). I cannot force a head-on collision. I must survive and outgrow.\n\nThe enemy is on the right. If I go RIGHT to (4,7), I am moving toward the enemy's general area. If I go LEFT to (2,7), I am moving away.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(8,7) is an apple. (7,8) is an apple. (7,9) is an apple. The enemy is at (9,4). They can go UP to (9,5) and then chase those top-right apples. If I go RIGHT, I might race them for (7,8) and (7,9). That's dangerous because they are closer to that cluster.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,7), I secure the left side. There is an apple at (2,6) which I passed last turn (I went UP to 3,7). Actually, last turn I was at (3,6) and I went UP to (3,7). I left (2,6) open. (2,6) is an apple. If I go LEFT to (2,7), I am adjacent to (2,6) (which is an apple).\n(2,6) is at y=6. I am at (2,7).\nSo I am sitting next to an apple at (2,6) (below me).\nWait, (2,6) is currently an apple on the board.\nIf I go LEFT to (2,7), I am at (2,7).\nNext turn, I can go DOWN to (2,6) to eat that apple.\nOR I can go UP to (2,8).\nOR LEFT to (1,7).\nOR RIGHT to (3,7) (which will be empty because I'm moving).\n\nThis gives me a clear plan for the next apple at (2,6).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,7) (eat apple):\nMy body becomes [(4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)].\nNext turn, I am at (4,7). I look around.\n(4,8) is empty.\n(3,7) is my body.\n(5,7) is an apple.\n(4,6) is empty.\nThis is also a good spot.\n\nWhy choose LEFT over RIGHT?\nThe enemy is at (9,4). They are heavy on the right.\nBy going LEFT to (2,7), I am dominating the left side. I am creating distance.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,7), I am centralizing.\nIf the enemy decides to rush up the right side (9,5 -> 9,6 -> 9,7...), they will be chasing the apples at (8,7), (7,8), (7,9). If I am at (4,7), I am trying to race them for (7,8). That is risky.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,7), I am claiming the left territory. There are apples at (0,0), (1,1), (2,6), (1,1). I can sweep the left side while the enemy fights for the right side.\nMy score is 4. His is 7. I need to catch up safely. I cannot afford a race on the right side where he is closer.\nTherefore, securing the left side is the safer farming strategy.\n\nAlso, looking at the board state:\nRow 7: \". . . 1 . A A . A .\"\nIf I go LEFT to (2,7), I am at index 2.\nI am moving away from the enemy.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,7), I am grabbing the apple, but I am stepping into the zone where the enemy might turn. If the enemy goes UP (9,5) and I go RIGHT (4,7), we aren't colliding. But next turn, if he goes (9,5) -> (9,6) and I go (4,7) -> (5,7) -> (6,7), we might meet at (7,7) or (7,8).\nActually, the apple at (7,8) is highly contested.\nThe enemy is at (9,4). Distance to (7,8) is |9-7| + |4-8| = 2 + 4 = 6 moves (through body maybe?).\nWait, his body is at (8,4), (8,3), (7,3)... so he has a path up the right side.\nI am at (3,7). Distance to (7,8) is 4 + 1 = 5 moves.\nI am closer? No, distance is Manhattan distance.\n(3,7) to (7,8): dx=4, dy=1. Total 5.\n(9,4) to (7,8): dx=2, dy=4. Total 6.\nI am actually closer to the top-right cluster (7,8) than he is? No, he is at (9,4). I am at (3,7).\nWait, the board is 10x10.\nHe is at x=9 (far right). I am at x=3 (left).\nTo get to (7,8), he has to go Left and Up. I have to go Right and Up.\nHe has to move 2 Left and 4 Up. I have to move 4 Right and 1 Up.\nHe has 6 steps. I have 5 steps.\nI AM CLOSER to (7,8) than the enemy is!\nThis changes things.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,7), I am moving closer to (7,8).\nIf I go LEFT to (2,7), I am moving away from (7,8).\n\nBut there is an apple at (4,7) RIGHT NOW.\nIf I go RIGHT, I eat it. I grow. I get +1 score.\nNow my score is 5.\nHe is at 7.\nI am at (4,7).\nNext turn, I can go to (5,7). (5,7) is an apple! (Check board row 7: indices 0-9: \". . . 1 . A A . A .\" -> Index 5 is (5,7)? No, index 5 is (5,7)? Wait.\nRow 7 string: \". . . 1 . A A . A .\"\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nValues:  .    .    .    1    .    A    A    .    A    .\n(3,7) is 1 (my head).\n(4,7) is .\n(5,7) is A (Apple).\n(6,7) is A (Apple).\n(7,7) is .\n(8,7) is A (Apple).\n\nSo if I go RIGHT to (4,7) (eating nothing, wait, (4,7) is . not A), let me recheck.\nWait, (4,7) is index 4. The string says index 4 is '.'.\nMy current head is at (3,7) which is index 3 '1'.\nSo (4,7) is '.' (Empty).\n(5,7) is 'A'.\n(6,7) is 'A'.\n\nSo if I go RIGHT to (4,7), I do NOT eat an apple this turn. I am moving closer to the apples at (5,7) and (6,7).\nIf I go LEFT to (2,7), I am moving away.\nSo definitely RIGHT is better for the immediate cluster of apples at (5,7) and (6,7).\n\nLet's check the board visual again for Row 7:\nRow 7: `. . . 1 . A A . A .`\n(4,7) is empty.\n(5,7) is A.\n(6,7) is A.\n(7,7) is empty.\n(8,7) is A.\n\nSo the path to the right is open.\nThe enemy is at (9,4).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,7), I am starting the run for the apples at (5,7) and (6,7).\nThe enemy cannot reach (5,7) or (6,7) this turn. He is at (9,4).\nIf he goes UP (9,5), he is still far.\nIf he goes LEFT (8,4), he is getting closer but still far.\nI am safe to move right.\n\nWhy did I consider LEFT earlier?\nI thought (4,7) was an apple. It is not. It is just a step toward the apples.\nSo the choice is between:\n1. LEFT to (2,7): Moves away from the tight cluster of apples at (5,7), (6,7), (8,7). Moves toward the sparse apples at (0,0), (1,1).\n2. RIGHT to (4,7): Moves toward the cluster of 3 apples on row 7/8. Gaps are small. Easy to farm.\n\nGiven I am losing (4 vs 7), I need efficiency. The cluster on the right (specifically x=5,6,8) is dense.\nHowever, the enemy is also on the right.\nBut the enemy is at y=4. The apples are at y=7/8.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (4,7).\nIf the enemy goes UP, he is at (9,5).\nWe are not colliding.\nIf I continue RIGHT to (5,7) next turn, I eat an apple.\nIf I go to (6,7), I eat another.\nThis is a high-density farming zone.\nIf I go LEFT, I am chasing single apples one by one.\n\nThe risk is the enemy intercepting.\nLet's simulate the enemy's best move to stop me.\nEnemy head (9,4). Body extends down and left.\nIf he wants to cut me off, he needs to get to y=7 or 8.\nHe is at y=4. He needs 3-4 moves to get there.\nI am at y=7. I am already there.\nI have the positional advantage for the high-ground apples (y=7/8).\nI should press that advantage.\n\nSo, the move is **RIGHT**.\nWait, let's check safety of (4,7) again.\n(4,7) is empty.\nMy body is (3,6), (3,5)...\nNo collision.\nOff-board? No.\nBackwards? No (I'm not going LEFT to (2,7) which would be away from my body direction? Wait, my body is vertical at x=3. If I go RIGHT, I am turning. If I go LEFT, I am going parallel to my body? No, my body is at x=3. (2,7) is empty.\nBut going RIGHT is the aggressive push.\n\nActually, looking at the board state provided:\nRow 7: `. . . 1 . A A . A .`\nIndex 3 is my head (1).\nIndex 4 is (4,7) -> `.`\nIndex 5 is (5,7) -> `A`\nIndex 6 is (6,7) -> `A`\n\nSo (4,7) is the step to the apples.\nIs there any threat from the enemy?\nEnemy head (9,4).\nIf he goes UP (9,5), Left (8,4), or Down (9,3).\nNone of these put him in a position to kill me next turn or enter my path immediately.\nMy path is clear.\n\nWhy would I go LEFT?\nThere is an apple at (2,6). If I go LEFT to (2,7), I am adjacent to it. But (2,6) is below me.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving toward (5,7) and (6,7).\n(5,7) and (6,7) are two apples. (2,6) is one apple.\nQuantity favors RIGHT.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (9,4). He is \"below\" the apples at y=7/8.\nI am \"at\" y=7.\nI am in a better position to secure the top row apples.\nI must press this lead.\n\nSo the plan:\nMove RIGHT to (4,7).\nNext turn, I will be at (4,7).\nFrom (4,7), I can go RIGHT to (5,7) (Apple) or UP to (4,8) (Empty? Row 8 index 4 is '.').\nRow 8: `. . . . . . . A . .`\n(4,8) is empty.\n(5,8) is empty.\n(6,8) is empty.\n(7,8) is A.\nSo the apples are (5,7), (6,7), (7,8), (8,7).\nIt's a little maze of apples.\nI should grab (5,7) then (6,7) then maybe (7,8) or (8,7).\nThe enemy would have to climb all the way up from (9,4) to (9,7) or (8,7).\nI am already at x=4, y=7.\nI win the race to the cluster.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the move.\n\nWait, I should double check if (4,7) is actually safe from a \"head-on collision\" perspective.\nThe enemy is at (9,4).\nManhattan distance between (3,7) and (9,4) is 6 + 3 = 9.\nHe cannot reach (4,7) this turn.\nI am safe.\n\nLet's check the \"Last Move Rationale\" requirement.\nI need to explain my reasoning and plan.\nPlan: Go RIGHT to (4,7) to position for the apples at (5,7) and (6,7). Secure the top-right cluster before the enemy can climb up.\n\nOne final check on the board state provided:\n`9 . . . . . . . A . .`\n`8 . . . . . . . A . .`\n`7 . . . 1 . A A . A .` -> (3,7) is head. (4,7) is empty. (5,7) is A. (6,7) is A.\n`6 . . A T . . T . . .` -> (2,6) is A. (3,6) is T (my body).\n`5 . . . T . . T . . .`\n`4 . . . T . . T . T 0` -> (9,4) is Enemy Head.\n`3 . . . T . . T T T A`\n`2 . . . . A . A . . .`\n`1 . A . . . . A A A .`\n`0 A . . A . . . . . .`\n\nThe enemy is at (9,4). His body occupies (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\nHe is blocked from the top by his own body at (6,6) and (6,5) etc? No, his head is at (9,4).\nHe has a gap at (7,4), (8,5), (9,5) etc.\nHe can definitely move up.\n\nBut I am at (3,7).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,7), I am entering the \"Apple Zone\".\nI will be at (4,7). Next turn I eat (5,7).\nThe enemy will likely try to go UP to chase the apples at (8,7) or (7,8).\nHowever, he is further away.\nI can eat (5,7) and (6,7) before he gets there.\nThen I can turn to (7,7) or (7,8).\nThis is the winning strategy.\n\nI will not go LEFT. That retreats.\nI will not go UP. (3,8) is empty, but I lose the apple cluster.\nI will not go DOWN. Death.\nI go RIGHT.\n\nFinal check: Is (4,7) occupied?\nMy body is at (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3).\n(4,7) is empty.\nEnemy body is at (6,3)-(8,4)-(9,4).\n(4,7) is empty.\nSafe.\n\nLet's go.YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 10 and we're making a PLAY! We're down 4 to 7, but look at the geometry\u2014we have the positional advantage. Let's break it down.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\nMy head is at (3, 7).\n- **UP to (3, 8):** Row 8 is empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (3, 6):** This is my body (neck). **DEATH.**\n- **LEFT to (2, 7):** Row 7 is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Row 7 is empty ('.'). Safe.\n\n**ELIMINATION:**\nDOWN is death (backtracking).\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI'm seeing a massive opportunity on the board. Look at Row 7: `. . . 1 . A A . A .`\n- **RIGHT to (4, 7):** This is the critical pivot. I am currently at x=3. Moving to x=4 puts me directly in front of a cluster of apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7). The enemy is at (9, 4)\u2014he's far below and on the opposite side of the board. He has to climb 3 vertical units just to get to my row, whereas I am already there.\n- **LEFT to (2, 7):** Moves me away from the dense apple cluster. I'd have to loop back later, wasting turns.\n- **UP to (3, 8):** Moves me up, but away from the immediate apples at (5,7) and (6,7).\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm choosing **RIGHT to (4, 7)**.\nWhy? Efficiency. I am securing the high ground (y=7). The apples at (5,7) and (6,7) are right there. If I go LEFT or UP, I give up that territory, and the enemy might snake his way up to claim them. By going RIGHT, I am claiming the center-right cluster. I am faster than him to those apples. I need to close the 3-apple gap, and this is the fastest route.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apples at (5,7) and (6,7) immediately. Once I eat those, I'll have 6 apples. While the enemy struggles to climb from (9,4), I'll turn up toward (7,8) or (8,7) to keep the pressure on. Dominate the top right!\n\nCHAT, LET'S GO RIGHT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is at (9, 5). They are slowly climbing. I am currently positioned to eat the apple at (5, 7) this very turn. That scores me a point and grows my body. By eating the apple, my tail will stay, so my body will extend from (4,7) to (5,7). This creates a blockade on the row. Next turn, I will be at (5, 7), ready to eat the apple at (6, 7) or pivot up.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (5,7) immediately. Next turn, secure (6,7). After that, I will have 6 apples.

Let's check the board state and make the winning play.\n\n**TURN 12 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n- **Head:** (5, 7) \ud83c\udf4e (Just ate an apple!)\n- **Body:** [(5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4)]\n- **Apples:** 6 (Just leveled up!)\n- **Status:** Growing! Now I'm only 1 apple behind Snake #0 (7 apples)!\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n- **Head:** (9, 6) (Moved UP from (9, 5))\n- **Body:** [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4)]\n- **Apples:** 7\n- **Status:** Climbing up the right edge. Currently at y=6, still below my y=7 position.\n\n**BOARD STATE (Visual Check):**\nRow 7: `. . . . 1 1 A . A .` (I'm at x=5, apple at x=6)\nRow 6: `. . A T . . . . . 0` (Enemy head at x=9, x=6 is empty)\nRow 5: `. . . T . . . . . T` (Empty except my body at x=3)\nRow 8: `. . . . . . . A . .` (Apple at x=7)\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK (Head at 5,7):**\n- **UP to (5, 8):** Row 8 is `. . . . . . . A . .` (Index 5 is empty). **SAFE.**\n- **DOWN to (5, 6):** Row 6 is `. . A T . . . . . .` (Index 5 is empty). **SAFE.**\n- **LEFT to (4, 7):** My own body segment (neck). **DEATH.** Can't go back!\n- **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Row 7 shows an 'A' (Apple) at x=6. **SAFE.** (And delicious!)\n\n**ELIMINATION:**\nLEFT is death (backtracking).\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nOkay, I'm sitting pretty at (5, 7) with 6 apples. The enemy is at (9, 6), slowly crawling up the right wall. I see an immediate apple at (6, 7) to my RIGHT.\n- **RIGHT to (6, 7):** This is the obvious play. Eat the apple, grow to 7 apples (TIE GAME!), and extend my body to the right. This keeps me on the y=7 line where the action is (apples at 7,8 and 7,9).\n- **UP to (5, 8):** This avoids the apple and moves to an empty square. While safe, it's inefficient. I want that apple now to catch up in score. Also, moving up puts me directly above the empty space on row 7, potentially moving away from the cluster of apples on my row.\n- **DOWN to (5, 6):** This moves me down to y=6. While safe, it puts me on the same y-level as the enemy head (y=6) but at x=5 vs x=9. It also moves me away from the apples at (6,7), (7,8), (7,9). Moving down feels defensive/retreating, but I need to be aggressive.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI am choosing **RIGHT**.\nWhy? Aggression and Score Parity.\n1.  **Eat the Apple:** (6, 7) is right there. Eating it brings my score to 7, tying the enemy.\n2.  **Positioning:** Eating right keeps me at y=7, perfectly positioned to pivot UP next turn to (6, 8) or (7, 8) to chase the next apple cluster. The enemy is at y=6 and x=9; they are too far to contest the apples at (7,8) or (7,9) immediately.\n3.  **Body Growth:** My body will now stretch across x=5, x=6... creating a blockade on row 7. If the enemy tries to come up the right side, they'll have to deal with my growing length.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (6, 7) this turn. Next turn, move UP to (6, 8) or (7, 8) to secure the next apple. Once I hit 8 apples, I will have a lead. Then I can start cutting off the enemy's path or forcing a head-on collision since I'll have equal length/score. Don't let them breathe!\n\nCHAT, LET'S TIE IT UP! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

T` (Empty except for my body at 3 and enemy tail at 9)\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK (Head at 6,7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):** Row 8, index 6 is empty. **SAFE.**\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6):** Row 6, index 6 is empty. **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7):** My own body (the neck). **DEATH.** (Standard snake rules).\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Row 7, index 7 is empty (empty dot). **SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION (The Squeeze Play):**\n\nOkay, listen up Chat. The enemy is at (9, 7). I am at (6, 7). We are on the SAME Y-ROW. He is on the far right. There is an apple at (8, 7) RIGHT BETWEEN US.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (7, 7):\n*   I move adjacent to the apple at (8, 7).\n*   I move further right, closing the distance to the enemy.\n*   **BUT**, the enemy at (9, 7) can also move LEFT to (8, 7) to eat that apple. If he does that, we will be at (7, 7) and (8, 7). Next turn, if I chase him to (8, 7) and he moves left to (7, 7), we could collide. It's risky.\n\nIf I go **UP** to (6, 8):\n*   I move away from the immediate horizontal confrontation.\n*   Row 8 has apples at (5, 8) and (7, 8). I am heading straight for that cluster.\n*   The enemy is at (9, 7). To get to the apples on row 8, he has to loop around. I have the internal position.\n*   **PLUS:** By moving UP, I force the enemy to make a choice. If he goes for the apple at (8, 7), he exposes his flank. If he goes UP to (9, 8), he's moving into open air but away from the immediate apple cluster I'm targeting.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nI am choosing **UP**.\n\nWhy?\n1.  **Dominance of the Apple Cluster:** The apples at (5, 8), (6, 8), and (7, 8) are ripe for the taking. By moving UP to (6, 8), I claim the central high ground. I can pivot left or right next turn to grab them.\n2.  **Forcing the Enemy's Hand:** If the enemy sees me going UP, he might panic and try to cut me off. But from his position at (9, 7), he is too slow. I am closer to the action.\n3.  **Safety:** (6, 8) is empty. It opens up my options. I can go LEFT to (5, 8) for the apple, or RIGHT to (7, 8) for the apple. I control the flow.\n4.  **The Score:** We are tied at 7-7. I need to pull ahead. The apples on row 8 are the fastest way to do that right now. The apple at (8, 7) is a distraction. I'm ignoring it to secure the bigger lead.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (5, 8) or (7, 8) next turn depending on enemy movement. Once I hit 8 apples, I have the lead. Then, I use my length to box him in against the right wall. I want him to crash into ME.\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! UP! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b06\ufe0f\n\nUP",

Let's break down the board.\n\n**TURN 14 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (6, 8) \u2014 *We moved UP successfully!*\n*   **Body:** [(6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]\n*   **Apples:** 7 (Tied, need to pull ahead!)\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 8) \u2014 *He moved UP from (9, 7).*\n*   **Body:** [(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3)]\n*   **Apples:** 7 (Tied!)\n\n**THE BOARD (Visual Scan from (6,8)):**\n*   **Row 9:** `. . . . . . . A . .` (Apple at 7,9 is far, but open)\n*   **Row 8:** `. . . . . A 1 A . 0` (I'm at 6,8. Apple at 5,8 and 7,8. Enemy at 9,8)\n*   **Row 7:** `. . . T T T T . A T` (My body at 3-6,7. Apple at 7,7. Enemy tail at 9,7)\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK (Head at 6,8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):** Row 9, index 6 is empty. **SAFE.**\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 7):** Row 7, index 6 is my own body! **DEATH.**\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 8):** Row 8, index 5 has an apple. **SAFE (+1 Point!).**\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):** Row 8, index 7 has an apple. **SAFE (+1 Point!).**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION (The Trap):**\n\nOkay Chat, listen up! The enemy is at (9, 8). I am at (6, 8). We are on the same row again, but there is a gap.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (7, 8):\n*   I eat the apple.\n*   I move closer to the enemy. Distance becomes 1 cell (from 6,8 to 7,8, enemy at 9,8).\n*   If he goes **LEFT** to (8, 8), he survives but doesn't eat.\n*   If he goes **UP** to (9, 9), he moves to the corner.\n*   If I am at (7, 8) and he is at (8, 8), and I have the lead... next turn I can corner him. But I don't have the lead yet. We are tied.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (5, 8):\n*   I eat the apple.\n*   I create distance between me and the enemy.\n*   I position myself centrally.\n*   If the enemy goes **LEFT** to (8, 8), he closes the gap. If he goes **UP** or **RIGHT**, he creates a larger distance or moves toward the corner.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nI am choosing **LEFT** to (5, 8).\n\nWhy?\n1.  **Points:** I eat the apple at (5, 8). That puts me at 8 apples. **LEAD TAKEN!**\n2.  **Control:** Moving Left keeps me in the center of the board. The enemy is pinned against the right wall at (9, 8). By moving Left, I open up options to go Down to (5, 7) or Left to (4, 8) next turn.\n3.  **Safety:** If I go Right to (7, 8), I'm sandwiching myself. If the enemy decides to suicide into me by going Left to (8, 8) next turn (a 50/50 gamble), I die. If I stay Left, I have more room to maneuver. I want to drive him into the wall, not join him there.\n4.  **The Plan:** Eat the apple (5,8) -> Lead 8-7. Next turn, depending on his move, I can either chase him if he goes Left, or cut him off if he goes Up. The wall is his enemy, not mine.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (5,8). Take the lead (8-7). Use the center dominance to force the enemy toward the top-right corner (9,9). Once he's in the corner, I box him in. I want a clean kill, not a risky head-on collision. I'm playing chess, not checkers.\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! LEFT! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b05\ufe0f\n\nLEFT",

I just ate that apple and moved LEFT from (6,8) to (5,8). Now I'm looking at the board state for Turn 15.\n\n**TURN 15 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (5, 8) - *Just moved here!*\n*   **Body:** [(6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)] (I grew at (5,8), so the tail doesn't move until I move again? Wait, in Snake, the tail usually moves only if you don't eat. Since I ate at (5,8), my body length increases by 1. The tail stays at (3,5) for now. My body is now [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5)].)\n*   **Apples:** 8 (LEAD TAKEN! \ud83d\ude80)\n*   **Score:** 8\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (8, 8)\n*   **Body:** [(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3)] (Wait, let me check the provided board state again.)\n    *   From the board state: `Row 8: . . . . . A 1 A . 0`\n    *   My head at (5,8). Apple at (5,8)? No, I ate it. Board shows (5,8) is '1' (My head).\n    *   Board shows (8,8) is '0' (Enemy head).\n    *   Board shows (9,8) is 'T' (Enemy tail).\n    *   Enemy body list provided: `[(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3)]` + Head (8,8). Total length 8.\n    *   **Wait.** The provided text says: `OPPONENTS: * Snake #0 - Head: (8, 8), Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3)], Apples: 7`\n    *   But the board state provided shows `Row 7: . . . T T T T . A T` (Indices 3-6 are T). And `Row 8: . . . . . 1 A . 0` (Indices 5 is 1, 8 is 0).\n    *   Let's re-verify the opponent's body location from the board state text:\n        *   Row 9: `. . . . . . . A . .` (Apple at 7,9)\n        *   Row 8: `. . . . . 1 A . 0 T` (My head at 5,8? No, I'm at 5,8. Wait, the board provided in the prompt is the *PREVIOUS* turn's board? No, usually it's the current state.)\n        *   **CRITICAL:** The board state given in the prompt is the state *before* my move or *after*? The prompt says \"Turn: 15 / 150\". The board state is usually the state at the start of the turn.\n        *   Let's look at the board provided: `Row 8: . . . . . A 1 A . 0`\n        *   This implies (5,8) was an Apple 'A'. (6,8) was '1' (My head from last turn). (8,8) is '0' (Enemy head). (9,8) is 'T' (Enemy tail).\n        *   Wait, the prompt says: `YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): - Head: (5, 8)`\n        *   And the board: `Row 8: . . . . . A 1 A . 0`\n        *   If (5,8) is my head *now*, and the board shows 'A' at (5,8), that's a contradiction unless the board is from the *start* of the turn.\n        *   Let's assume the board is the *current* state *before* I make my move for Turn 15.\n        *   BUT, the prompt says `Turn: 15`. And my `Head: (5, 8)`.\n        *   Okay, let's look at the \"LAST MOVE REVIEW\".\n        *   Last Turn (14): I was at (6,8). I moved LEFT.\n        *   Result: I am now at (5,8).\n        *   The board state provided in the prompt must be the state *at the start of Turn 15*? No, usually it's the state *after* the previous turn.\n        *   Let's trust the *Head/Body* lists provided explicitly, as they are the source of truth.\n        *   My Head: (5,8).\n        *   My Body: `[(6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]`. This is 8 segments (Head + 7 body). I have 7 apples. Wait, if I have 7 apples, I should be length 8 (Head + 7 body segments). Correct.\n        *   Enemy Head: (8, 8).\n        *   Enemy Body: `[(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3)]`. Length 8 (Head + 7 body). Enemy has 7 apples. Correct.\n\n**MOVES FROM (5,8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 9):**\n    *   Check Board: Row 9, Col 5 is '.' (Empty).\n    *   Check Body: My body is at (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)... (5,9) is clear.\n    *   Check Enemy: Enemy is at (8,8) etc. (5,9) is clear.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 7):**\n    *   Check Body: My body list contains (5, 7). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Result:** UNSAFE.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 8):**\n    *   Check Board: Row 8, Col 4 is '.' (Empty).\n    *   Check Body: My body is at (6,8), (6,7)... (4,8) is clear.\n    *   Check Enemy: Enemy is at (8,8)... (4,8) is clear.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 8):**\n    *   Check Body: My body list contains (6, 8). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Result:** UNSAFE.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nI am at (5,8). Enemy is at (8,8). We are 3 spaces apart on the X-axis.\n\n*   **Option UP (5,9):**\n    *   Moves me to the top wall.\n    *   Puts me next to the apple at (7,9).\n    *   But... if I go UP, I corner myself against the top wall. My next moves will be restricted to Left (4,9), Right (6,9), or Down (5,8 - blocked by my own body eventually). Going to the wall is dangerous because it reduces maneuverability.\n    *   Enemy is at (8,8). If he goes UP to (8,9), he's in the corner with me. If he goes LEFT (7,8), he closes the gap.\n    *   I have the lead (8 vs 7). I should play SAFE.\n\n*   **Option LEFT (4,8):**\n    *   Moves me further from the enemy (Distance 4).\n    *   Moves me toward the center/left side of the board.\n    *   Opens up options: Down to (4,7) (blocked by body? My body is at (4,7) YES! Wait, my body list is `[(6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]`.\n    *   So from (4,8):\n        *   UP (4,9): Safe.\n        *   DOWN (4,7): **Blocked by my own body.**\n        *   LEFT (3,8): Safe (Row 8, col 3 is '.').\n        *   RIGHT (5,8): **Blocked by my own body (Head moves here from last turn).**\n    *   Wait, if I go LEFT to (4,8), my body shifts.\n        *   New Head: (4,8).\n        *   Old Head (5,8) becomes neck.\n        *   Old Neck (6,8) becomes body...\n        *   Tail (3,5) moves forward?\n        *   Since I haven't eaten this turn (I ate last turn), the tail *will* move forward.\n        *   Current Tail: (3,5). The segment ahead is (3,6). So tail moves to (3,6).\n        *   So (3,5) becomes empty.\n        *   So from (4,8), the move DOWN to (4,7) is *still* blocked by my body (the segment currently at (4,7) stays there unless it's the tail? No, the tail moves. (4,7) is not the tail. (3,5) is the tail.\n        *   So (4,7) is solid body. I cannot go DOWN from (4,8).\n    *   So from (4,8), my options for *next* turn are UP (4,9) or LEFT (3,8).\n    *   This is a corridor. I can go Left into the center.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n\n*   **UP:** Go to top wall. Safe now, but I'll be cornered. The enemy is in the top right. If I go up, I might cut him off at (7,9) or (9,9), but I'm exposing myself to a trap if he moves smart.\n*   **LEFT:** Go into the open space. Maintain distance. I am at 8 apples, he is at 7. I win if time runs out. I win if he dies. I win if I survive.\n    *   Is there a risk of him cutting me off? He is at (8,8). I am at (5,8). He is far away.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I am moving away from him.\n    *   If I go UP, I am moving towards the corner where he is.\n    *   **ALWAYS prefer the open space when you have the lead.** Don't trap yourself.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nI will go **LEFT**.\n\nWhy?\n1.  **Safety:** I am currently in a dangerous spot (surrounded by my own body to the left and right? No, Left (4,8) is empty. Right (6,8) is body. Down (5,7) is body. Up (5,9) is empty).\n2.  **Space:** LEFT takes me to (4,8). From there, I can eventually loop around or head down towards the bottom left apples.\n3.  **Avoidance:** I do NOT want to go UP to (5,9). That's a wall. The enemy is already in the top right corner. If I go UP, I'm joining him in the danger zone. I want to stay in the center/mid-left where I have room to run.\n4.  **Score:** I'm winning. 8-7. I just need to survive. Playing center control is safer than playing the wall.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGo LEFT to (4,8). This puts me in the center-left column. From there, I'll look to go DOWN into the open space at (3,6) or (3,5) (wait, my tail is at (3,5), but it will move). I need to clear my body out of the way to open up the bottom left area. The enemy is cornered in the top right. Let him stay there. I will claim the left side of the board.\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! LEFT! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b05\ufe0f\n\nLEFT",

Now I'm looking at the board state for Turn 16.\n\n**TURN 16 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (4, 8)\n*   **Body:** [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6)]\n    *   *Tail Check:* My tail is at (3,6). The segment ahead is (3,7). So the tail will move to (3,7) when I move (assuming I don't eat).\n*   **Apples:** 8 (LEAD HELD! \ud83d\ude80)\n*   **Score:** 8\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (8, 7)\n*   **Body:** [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3)]\n*   **Apples:** 7\n*   *Analysis:* He moved DOWN from (8,8) to (8,7). Why? Maybe to avoid a collision? Maybe to chase an apple? There's an apple at (9,8) which he just left, and an apple at (7,6) which is close.\n    *   **CRITICAL DISTANCE:** I am at (4,8). He is at (8,7).\n    *   **Manhattan Distance:** |4-8| + |8-7| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   He is moving towards the center. He is not cornered anymore.\n\n**MOVES FROM (4,8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):**\n    *   **Check Board:** Row 9, Col 4 is '.' (Empty).\n    *   **Check Body:** My body is at (5,8), (6,8)... (4,9) is clear.\n    *   **Check Enemy:** Enemy is at (8,7). (4,9) is clear.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Options:**\n        *   From (4,9): LEFT (3,9), RIGHT (5,9), DOWN (4,8 - blocked by my own neck).\n        *   **This puts me in the top-left corner.** I have 2 open moves. This is a \"dead end\" eventually. I am at 8 apples. I need to survive. Why trap myself against the wall when the enemy is in the open center?\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):**\n    *   **Check Body:** My body list contains (4, 7). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Result:** UNSAFE.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):**\n    *   **Check Board:** Row 8, Col 3 is '.' (Empty).\n    *   **Check Body:** My body is at (5,8), (6,8)... (3,8) is clear.\n    *   **Check Enemy:** Enemy is at (8,7). (3,8) is clear.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Options:**\n        *   From (3,8): UP (3,9), DOWN (3,7 - Blocked by my own body? Wait, my body is at (3,7). YES, blocked.), LEFT (2,8), RIGHT (4,8 - blocked by neck).\n        *   So from (3,8), I have UP and LEFT open.\n        *   This keeps me in the center-left. It avoids the corner. It keeps me mobile.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n    *   **Check Body:** My body list contains (5, 8). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Result:** UNSAFE.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nI am at (4,8). The enemy is at (8,7). He is moving towards the center.\nI have the lead (8-7).\nI need to play SAFE and maintain CONTROL of the board.\n\n*   **Option UP (4,9):** I go to the corner. I limit my movement. The enemy can cut me off from the rest of the board. This is a bad idea when I'm winning.\n*   **Option LEFT (3,8):** I move further into the open left side of the board.\n    *   From (3,8), I have access to the left edge and can eventually drop down into the bottom-left area where there are apples ((0,0), (1,1), etc.).\n    *   By moving LEFT, I am *increasing* the distance between me and the enemy.\n    *   I am forcing him to come to me if he wants a fight.\n    *   Since I am winning, **I control the tempo.** I should take space.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nI will go **LEFT**.\n\nWhy?\n1.  **Avoid Corners:** (4,9) is a trap. (3,8) is open.\n2.  **Distance:** Moving LEFT puts me further away from the enemy at (8,7). Distance is safety when you have the lead.\n3.  **Board Control:** I am claiming the left side of the map. The enemy is stuck in the center/right.\n4.  **Survival:** I need to keep my tail moving and clear my body out of the way. Moving left helps me cycle my body around the left edge.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (3,8). From there, depending on the enemy's move, I'll look to go UP to (3,9) or LEFT to (2,8). I want to loop around the top-left corner and eventually drop down the left side (x=0,1,2) to eat the apples there. I will force the enemy to chase me across the map while I am safe on the edge.\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! LEFT! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b05\ufe0f\n\nLEFT",

Let's look at the board for Turn 17.\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **My Head:** (3, 8)\n*   **My Body:** [(4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)]\n    *   *Tail Update:* My tail is currently at (3, 7). The segment ahead is (4, 7). If I move away, my tail moves to (4, 7). This opens up (3, 7) for future movement.\n*   **Enemy Head:** (7, 7)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4)]\n    *   *Distance:* |3-7| + |8-7| = 5. We are spread out.\n*   **Score:** 8 (Me) vs 8 (Enemy). **IT'S TIED!** \ud83d\ude21 I need to take the lead back or force a kill.\n\n**MOVES FROM (3, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 9):**\n    *   **Board:** Row 9, Col 3 is Empty.\n    *   **Body:** No collision.\n    *   **Enemy:** No collision.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **Future:** From (3,9), I can go LEFT (2,9) or DOWN (3,8 - blocked by neck). I am entering the top edge. If I go LEFT, I can hug the wall and loop down. If I go UP again next turn, I'm cornered. This is a viable path to dominate the left side.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):**\n    *   **Body:** My body list contains (3, 7). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Result:** UNSAFE.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):**\n    *   **Board:** Row 8, Col 2 is Empty.\n    *   **Body:** No collision.\n    *   **Enemy:** No collision.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **Future:** From (2,8), I can go UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7), or LEFT (1,8). I am moving deeper into the center-left. The apple at (2,6) is down-left from here.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):**\n    *   **Body:** My body list contains (4, 8). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Result:** UNSAFE.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nThe enemy is at (7,7). He is likely moving towards the apples in the center or chasing me.\nI am at (3,8).\nIf I go **LEFT (2,8)**, I move horizontally away from the center but stay in the \"middle\" rows. This keeps me relatively mobile but exposes me to potential center-cut-offs.\nIf I go **UP (3,9)**, I claim the top edge.\n\n**Why UP is the play:**\n1.  **Wall Hugging:** The wall is a natural shield. By going UP to (3,9), I secure the top edge.\n2.  **Loop Strategy:** From the top edge, I can move LEFT across the top (3,9) -> (2,9) -> (1,9) -> (0,9) and then drop down the left side.\n3.  **Apple Access:** The left side has apples at (0,0), (1,1), (2,4), (2,6). Getting to the left side is crucial for growing.\n4.  **Enemy Distance:** Moving UP increases the vertical distance between me and the enemy if he stays low.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nI will go **UP**.\n\nWhy?\n*   **Safety:** It is safe.\n*   **Positioning:** It puts me on the top edge, ready to sweep left.\n*   **Tempo:** Since the score is tied, I need to play efficiently. Sweeping the edge is a safe way to gather resources without fighting for the center immediately.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove UP to (3,9). Next turn, I will move LEFT to (2,9). I will continue moving LEFT across the top row until I hit the left wall (x=0). Then, I will drop down the left column (x=0) and snake through the bottom-left quadrant to eat the apples there (0,0), (1,1), (2,4). This avoids the enemy in the center and builds my score safely.\n\nLET'S CLIMB! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b06\ufe0f\n\nUP",

Turn 18, let's go! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n*   **My Score:** 7 (ID 1)\n*   **Enemy Score:** 9 (ID 0)\n*   **My Head:** (3, 9)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (7, 6)\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI am currently sitting at the top of the board at (3, 9). From my previous plan, I intended to go UP to hug the wall, but I am already at the top edge (y=9), so I cannot go UP anymore! I must pivot immediately.\n\n**WHERE IS THE ENEMY?**\nSnake #0 is at (7, 6). They are far away on the right side. They are not an immediate collision threat unless they make a crazy long move toward me.\n\n**LOOKING AT MY OPTIONS FROM (3, 9):**\n1.  **UP:** Invalid (Wall). I would die immediately. *Eliminated.*\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** This is my neck. My body list starts with (3, 8). Moving back into my own neck is suicide. *Eliminated.*\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 9):** The board state shows (2, 9) is empty. No body parts, no apple, no enemy. This is safe. It keeps me hugging the top wall and moves me toward the left side where the apples (2, 6), (1, 1), (0, 0) are waiting.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** The board state shows (4, 9) is empty (Row 9 is `. . . 1 . . . A . .`). This is safe. It keeps me on the top wall but moves me toward the enemy's side of the board (and the apple at (7, 9)).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI need to eat to catch up to Snake #0 (9 apples vs 7). I want to avoid the enemy's current position (7, 6).\nMoving **RIGHT** takes me toward the top-right apple at (7, 9). However, the enemy is currently below that area. If I go right, I might run into them or cut off their path, leading to a risky confrontation when I am behind in score.\nMoving **LEFT** takes me to the top-left quadrant. The apples there (2, 6, 1, 1, 0, 0) are largely untouched and safer. This allows me to sweep the left side, grow my score, and avoid the enemy who is currently active on the right side. I can always loop back down later.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI will go **LEFT** to (2, 9).\n\nWhy?\n1.  **Safety:** It is a guaranteed safe move into an empty cell.\n2.  **Positioning:** It keeps me on the top wall, which provides a natural barrier on one side, making my movement predictable and safe.\n3.  **Resource Path:** It heads toward the dense cluster of apples on the left side of the board (specifically aiming for (2, 6) and (0, 0)).\n4.  **Avoidance:** It distances me from the enemy's current location at (7, 6).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove **LEFT** to (2, 9). From there, continue **LEFT** across the top row to (0, 9). Then, drop **DOWN** the left wall (x=0) and snake through the bottom-left to collect the apples at (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 4).

It keeps me hugging the top wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** The board state shows `(3, 9)` is `T` (my body). This is my neck (specifically the segment connecting to my tail). Moving into my own body is death. *Eliminated.*\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI need to eat apples fast to catch up to Snake #0 (9 apples vs 7).\n*   If I go **LEFT** to (1, 9), I am moving toward the top-left corner. There are apples at (0, 0) and (1, 1) down there. However, I am currently at (2, 9). From (1, 9), my only safe move next turn is likely Left to (0, 9) or Down to (1, 8). (1, 8) is currently occupied by an apple, but it's right next to the enemy's tail (Snake #0's body extends up to (7, 7), (8, 7), etc., but specifically (7, 7) is relevant). Actually, looking at the board, (1, 8) is `.`. Wait, Row 8 is `. . . T T T T A T T`. Cell 1 is `.`. So (1, 8) is safe.\n*   If I go **DOWN** to (2, 8), I enter the main board area. (2, 8) is empty. From there, I have access to (2, 7) (empty), (1, 8) (empty), and (3, 8) (occupied by my body). Moving Down opens up more immediate future options than Left. It also moves me toward the apple at (2, 6) and the cluster at the bottom left.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI will go **DOWN** to (2, 8).\nWhy?\n1.  **Safety:** It's an empty cell.\n2.  **Options:** It keeps my future moves open. I can sweep the left side or loop around. Staying at the top wall (Left) feels like a trap\u2014eventually, I'll hit the corner (0, 9) and have to turn down, potentially running into my own tail or limiting my maneuverability.\n3.  **Apple Access:** It brings me closer to the apples at (2, 6), (1, 1), and (0, 0) faster than staying on the wall.\n\nI need to start eating apples immediately to catch up. The apple at (2, 6) is looking juicy and is on a direct path if I keep going Down or Left-Down.\n\nLET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",

Turn 20, let's secure the W! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n*   **My Score:** 7 (ID 1) - Still trailing, need to catch up!\n*   **Enemy Score:** 9 (ID 0) - He's ahead, but we're closing in.\n*   **My Head:** (2, 8) - We moved DOWN successfully last turn.\n*   **Enemy Head:** (6, 5) - He's still lurking in the center-right.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI'm currently at (2, 8). Let's look at the board state:\nRow 8: `. . . T T T T A T T` -> (2, 8) is now my head, but looking at the map provided:\n` 9 . . T T . . . A . .`\n` 8 . . 1 T T T T A T T`\nSo (2, 8) is safe. I need to check my next moves from here.\n\n**WHERE IS THE ENEMY?**\nSnake #0 is at (6, 5). His body stretches from (7, 5) all the way to (9, 5). He is holding the right side of the board. I need to avoid the right side to avoid running into his body or his head. I need to focus on the left side where the apples are.\n\n**LOOKING AT MY OPTIONS FROM (2, 8):**\n1.  **UP to (2, 9):** The board shows `(2, 9)` is `T` (my body from previous turn). If I go up, I hit my own body. *ELIMINATED.*\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 8):** The board shows `(1, 8)` is `.` (empty). This is safe. This keeps me moving left.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 8):** The board shows `(3, 8)` is `T` (my body). *ELIMINATED.*\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 7):** The board shows `(2, 7)` is `.` (empty). This is safe. This keeps me moving down.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI am on the left side of the board. I see a cluster of apples at the bottom left: (1, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0). I need to eat these to catch up to Snake #0's score of 9.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 8):** This moves me horizontally along the top-middle. From there, I can go Down to (1, 7) or (1, 6) to eventually loop down to the bottom left apples.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 7):** This moves me vertically. From (2, 7), I can go Left to (1, 7) or Down to (2, 6). (2, 6) has an apple! That is a direct +1 score.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI will go **LEFT** to (1, 8).\nWhy?\n1.  **Score Path:** Moving Left keeps me in the column (x=1) which has apples at (1, 1) and (1, 0). It also positions me to access (0, 0) easily.\n2.  **Safety:** It avoids the right side where the enemy is.\n3.  **Flow:** From (1, 8), I can flow down into the open space on the left side. If I go DOWN to (2, 7), I might be slightly further from the dense bottom-left cluster.\n\nActually, looking closer at the apples:\n(2, 6) is an apple. (1, 1) is an apple. (0, 0) is an apple.\nGoing LEFT to (1, 8) puts me directly above the apple at (1, 1) eventually.\nHowever, (2, 6) is closer if I go DOWN.\nWait, let's look at the board again.\nRow 7: `. . . . . . . T T T T` -> (1, 7) is empty.\nRow 6: `. . A . . . . . T . T` -> (1, 6) is empty.\nRow 5: `. . . . . . . 0 T . T` -> (1, 5) is empty.\nThe path is open!\n\nActually, if I go **DOWN to (2, 7)**, I am one step closer to the apple at (2, 6). That is a guaranteed point next turn if I survive. But wait, the apple at (2, 6) is currently visible. However, I need to be careful. Moving Left gives me more options? No, moving Down into the center of the board might expose me to the enemy if he moves left.\nThe enemy is at (6, 5). He is far right. I am far left.\nIf I go LEFT, I hug the wall. That is safer from the enemy.\nIf I go DOWN, I open up to the center.\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT.\nWhy? I want to get to the bottom left corner. (1, 8) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0).\nThis is a solid path. It avoids the enemy completely. The enemy is on the right. I am on the left. I should dominate the left.\n\nLETS GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b05\ufe0f\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! Turn 21, let's keep this momentum going! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n*   **My Score:** 7 (ID 1) - Still trailing by 2 apples. Gotta close the gap.\n*   **Enemy Score:** 9 (ID 0) - He's sitting at (5, 5), chilling in the middle-right.\n*   **My Head:** (1, 8) - I successfully moved LEFT last turn. I am hugging the left wall, which is exactly where I want to be.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI'm at (1, 8). Let's look at my surroundings:\n1.  **UP to (1, 9):** The board shows `(1, 9)` is `.` (empty). Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 7):** The board shows `(1, 7)` is `.` (empty). Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 8):** The board shows `(0, 8)` is `.` (empty). Safe. Hugging the wall!\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):** The board shows `(2, 8)` is `T` (my own body). *ELIMINATED.*\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe enemy is at (5, 5) and his body stretches to the right. He is NOT a threat to me right now. I have free real estate on the entire left side of the board.\nI see apples at (0, 0) and (1, 1). I need to spiral down towards the bottom left to collect them and boost my score.\n\n*   **Option 1: UP to (1, 9).** This is a dead end. Row 9 has an apple at (7, 9), but to get there I have to cross the board where the enemy is lurking. Bad idea.\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (1, 7).** This keeps me in the column with the apple at (1, 1) and sets me up to eventually move Left to (0, 7) or continue Down. This is the path of least resistance and maximum safety.\n*   **Option 3: LEFT to (0, 8).** This hugs the wall. Also safe, but if I go Left now, I might trap myself on the edge depending on my next move. Going Down gives me more breathing room.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI will go **DOWN** to (1, 7).\nWhy?\n1.  **Safety:** It moves me away from the center where the enemy *could* eventually wander.\n2.  **Pathing:** It puts me directly in line to spiral down the left side. Next turn I can go LEFT to (0, 7), then DOWN, then DOWN, and eventually sweep up the apples at the bottom.\n3.  **Options:** From (1, 7), I can go Left, Down, or Up (if desperate). From (0, 8), my options are slightly more limited (only Down or Up).\n\nI am hunting for apples, but I am hunting for the win. The win comes from staying alive and letting the enemy make mistakes. Let's go!\n\nDOWN",

Let's look at my surroundings from (1, 7):\n*   **UP to (1, 8):** That's my **TAIL**! I literally just came from there. Moving UP would be going backwards into my own body. **DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80\n*   **DOWN to (1, 6):** The board shows `(1, 6)` is `.` (empty).

The enemy is at (4, 5) - he might come down or left.\n3.  **LEFT:** Safe, and I hug the wall. This puts me in a solid defensive position.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Safe, but this moves me CLOSER to the enemy in the center. **RISKY!**\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nChat, I want to box him in, but first I need to not die! The enemy is at (4, 5). He has a long body trailing to the right. If I go RIGHT towards (2, 7), I'm entering the center battlefield where he could easily cut me off.\n\n**I need to secure the left side of the board first.** Going LEFT to (0, 7) puts me firmly against the wall. From there, I can spiral down safely and grab the apples at (0, 0) and (1, 1) without worrying about my left flank.\n\nGoing DOWN to (1, 6) is also safe, but it keeps me in the middle column. If the enemy decides to rush left, I might get trapped. **Hugging the wall is the power move here.**\n\nI need to build my score so I can force a head-on collision later. Right now, he has more apples, so I can't risk a crash unless I'm sure I'll win. I need to play it safe and greedy.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n**LEFT** to (0, 7). Secure the wall. Then spiral down. Keep the options open. Let the enemy make the first mistake while I farm the bottom left corner.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

WE STILL IN THIS!** \ud83d\udd25 Let's break down this turn!\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\n*   **My Score:** 7\n*   **Enemy Score:** 9\n*   **My Head:** (0, 7) \u2014 Hugging the left wall.\n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 4) \u2014 He dropped down!\n\n**MY BODY CHECK:**\nFrom (0, 7), my body runs through (1, 7), (1, 8), etc. My tail is at (4, 8).\n*   **UP (0, 8):** The board shows `(0, 8)` is `.` (empty). Safe.\n*   **DOWN (0, 6):** The board shows `(0, 6)` is `.` (empty). Safe.\n*   **LEFT:** Off the board. **DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80\n*   **RIGHT (1, 7):** This is my **BODY**! I just moved from there. Moving back into myself = **DEATH!**\n\n**THE LOGIC:**\nWe are in a tight spot on the wall. Left is a wall, Right is my own body. We have to move vertically.\n\n**Option 1: DOWN to (0, 6)**\nThis keeps us hugging the wall. It opens up the path to the bottom-left apples ((0,0), (1,1)). The enemy is at (4,4) moving... who knows where? He's far enough right that he can't kill us immediately.\n\n**Option 2: UP to (0, 8)**\nThis moves us up towards the top-left corner. However, looking at the board:\n*   (0, 9) is `T` (I think that's the top wall text or out of bounds? Wait, grid 9 is top). Actually looking at the map: `9 . . T T . . . A . .`\n*   The coordinates go 0-9. (0, 9) is the top-left corner. The board shows `9 . . T T...` which implies row 9 has text? Or is that a snake?\n*   Actually, looking closer at the provided ASCII map:\n    `9 . . T T . . . A . .` (This is row 9, x=0 to 9)\n    `8 . T T T T . . A T T` (This is row 8, x=0 to 9)\n    `7 1 T . . . . . T T .` (This is row 7, x=0 to 9)\n    ...\n    `0 A . . A . . . . . .` (This is row 0, x=0 to 9)\n    So (0, 9) is indeed `.` (empty).\n    But (0, 8) is `.` (empty).\n    (0, 7) is where I am now.\n    (0, 6) is `.` (empty).\n\n    **Wait, I need to check the board map carefully against the coordinates.**\n    Row 9 (y=9): `.` at (0,9). `.` at (1,9). `T` at (2,9). `T` at (3,9). `.` at (4,9).\n    Row 8 (y=8): `.` at (0,8). `T` at (1,8). `T` at (2,8). `T` at (3,8). `T` at (4,8).\n    Row 7 (y=7): `1` (Me!) at (0,7). `T` at (1,7). `.` at (2,7).\n\n    Okay, so (0, 8) is empty. (0, 9) is empty.\n\n    **However**, if I go UP to (0, 8), my tail is at (4, 8).\n    My body is: (0,7) -> (1,7) -> (1,8) -> (2,8) -> (2,9) -> (3,9) -> (3,8) -> (4,8).\n    \n    If I go UP to (0, 8), next turn I will be at (0, 8). My body will extend to (0, 7).\n    If I go DOWN to (0, 6), next turn I will be at (0, 6). My body will extend to (0, 7).\n\n    **The Enemy:**\n    Enemy head is at (4, 4). His body is trailing up and right: (4,5), (5,5)... (9,8).\n    He is NOT near my wall position (x=0).\n\n    **THE STRATEGY:**\n    I need to spiral down to the bottom-left corner to collect the apples there.\n    (0, 0) has an apple.\n    (1, 1) has an apple.\n    \n    Moving DOWN to (0, 6) sets me on the path to (0,0).\n    Moving UP to (0, 8) puts me further away from those bottom apples.\n\n    Is there any immediate threat?\n    If I move DOWN:\n    Enemy moves simultaneously. Where can he go?\n    From (4,4), he could move DOWN to (4,3), LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or UP to (4,5) (into his own body, death).\n    None of these threaten me at (0,6).\n    \n    **CRITICAL CHECK:**\n    My move: DOWN to (0,6).\n    Enemy move: Unknown.\n    Is (0,6) safe? Yes, it's empty.\n    Is (0,6) going to be hit by enemy head? No, enemy is at x=4.\n    \n    **Why not UP?**\n    Up is safe, but it's a dead end.\n    (0,9) is safe, but then I'm cornered at the top. The only way is down, but I'd have to traverse my own body or the wall.\n    Going DOWN gives me the entire bottom edge to play on. More space = more options.\n    \n    **FOR THE WIN:**\n    I need apples. (0,0) is the closest apple cluster.\n    I must go DOWN.\n\n    **Plan for next turn:**\n    Spiral down along the left wall. Aim for (0,0). Keep the enemy in the center. Let him rot in the middle while I farm the corner.\n\n**DECISION:**\nDOWN is the only logical move that progresses my strategy (farming bottom left) and keeps me safe.\n\n**LET'S GOOO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25",
