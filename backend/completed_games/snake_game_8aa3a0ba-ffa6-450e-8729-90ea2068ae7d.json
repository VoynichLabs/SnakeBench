They could go DOWN to (2, 4) or LEFT to (1, 5), maybe toward apples at (2, 3) or (1, 3). If I go UP to (1, 3), I grab an apple, grow to length 2, and maybe cut off their path down. If I go DOWN to (1, 1), I also get an apple but move away from enemy.\n\nWe want to be AGGRESSIVE. Going UP puts me closer to enemy, sets up potential boxing later. Also, if they go DOWN to (2, 4) next turn, I could go RIGHT to (2, 3) and threaten a head-on if I have length advantage soon.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Get bigger than enemy fast, then force them toward walls or into my body. Right now, secure apples while staying flexible. UP feels like the power move \u2014 closer to enemy, apple, and control of center-top.\n\nLet's go UP and start dominating! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nUP",

LET'S REVIEW THE SITUATION! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**My head:** (1, 3)  \n**My body:** [(1, 2)] (Tail)  \n**Enemy head:** (3, 5)  \n**Enemy body:** None (length 1)\n\nAlright, check all moves:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (1, 4) \u2014 Open space, no apple. Safe? No walls, not my body, enemy far.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 2) \u2014 WAIT! That's my own tail! But is that safe? Rule says: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" My head is at (1,3), my tail is at (1,2). That's directly behind me? YES \u2014 if I go DOWN, I move into (1,2), which is my tail. That's moving backwards into my own body segment. That's **SUICIDE**! \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 3) \u2014 Open, no apple. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 3) \u2014 Open, has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Safe? No enemy body there, not my body.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** Enemy at (3,5). They could go DOWN to (3,4) toward apple at (4,5)? Or LEFT to (2,5), RIGHT to (4,5), UP to (3,6). They might go for apple at (4,5) or (2,3).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,3), I grab apple, grow to length 3. But then my head is at (2,3), enemy could potentially move to (2,4) or (2,5)? Wait, enemy at (3,5) can't reach (2,3) in one move. But if they go LEFT to (2,5), they're two away. Then next turn they could go DOWN to (2,4), then LEFT to (1,4) or RIGHT to (3,4)... hmm.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,4), I stay length 2, move toward center, keep options open.  \nIf I go LEFT to (0,3), I move toward edge \u2014 less future flexibility.\n\n**Aggression plan:** We're up 1-0. We want to grow AND pressure. RIGHT gets apple, grows, puts me at (2,3) \u2014 closer to enemy's possible path down. Also sets up potential to cut off enemy from apples on left side.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about head-on collision risk? If enemy goes DOWN to (3,4) and I go RIGHT to (2,3), no collision. If enemy goes LEFT to (2,5) and I go RIGHT to (2,3), still two apart. Safe this turn.\n\n**Future flexibility:** After RIGHT, my body will be [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2)]? Wait, growth: new head at (2,3), old head (1,3) becomes neck, tail stays (1,2) until we move? Actually, when you eat apple, you grow \u2014 so next turn body will be: head at new spot, then (1,3), then (1,2), tail doesn't move. So length 3.\n\nThen my possible moves next turn from (2,3): UP (2,4), DOWN (2,2), LEFT (1,3) \u2014 but that's my neck! That's backwards into my own body? Actually, (1,3) will be my neck next turn, so moving LEFT into (1,3) would be moving backwards into my own body \u2014 that would be suicide next turn! So DOWN or RIGHT might be safer... but we'll assess next turn.\n\nGoing UP to (1,4) keeps length 2, more open options next turn.\n\nBut chat \u2014 WE'RE HERE TO DOMINATE! Growing early gives us score advantage to force head-on later. Let's take the apple at (2,3), extend our lead to 2-0, and start boxing enemy toward the wall!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get to length 3, use body to control center-left. Watch enemy's move \u2014 if they go for apple at (4,5), we can maybe swing up and cut them off. Next turn, consider moving UP to (2,4) or DOWN to (2,2) to avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nRIGHT is the power move! Let's feast! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

Their possible moves:  \n- UP to (5,9): Empty.  \n- DOWN to (5,7): Their own body (segment 2). \u274c  \n- LEFT to (4,8): Empty.  \n- RIGHT to (6,8): APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e  \n\nThey'll likely go RIGHT to (6,8) for the apple and growth. Or maybe UP to (5,9) to avoid boxing themselves? Either way, NO HEAD-ON COLLISION risk with our (0,2) or (0,0) moves. We're CLEAR! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICE:**  \n- **UP to (0,2)**: Eat apple, grow to length 5. Next turn from (0,2), our options: UP to (0,3), RIGHT to (1,2), or DOWN back to (0,1) (but that's our new neck? Let's check... after eating, our body will be: head (0,2), then (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). So DOWN to (0,1) is our own new body segment! \u274c So next turn from (0,2) only UP and RIGHT are safe. That's a bit limiting...  \n- **DOWN to (0,0)**: Eat apple, grow to length 5. Next turn from (0,0), our options: UP to (0,1) (our new body segment? Wait, after eating, body: head (0,0), then (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). So UP to (0,1) is our own body! \u274c So only RIGHT to (1,0) is safe? That's a DEAD END! \ud83d\ude31 Trapped!  \n\n**VERDICT:** UP gives us two safe exits next turn (UP to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,2)). DOWN traps us horribly. UP is CLEARLY SUPERIOR!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nEat the (0,2) apple, then assess. We can push UP toward (0,3) and maybe (0,4) to control the left wall, or swing RIGHT to (1,2) to move toward the center. Enemy will be longer (6 after eating), so avoid head-on until we match length.

Board shows '.' at (0,3) \u2705\n- DOWN to (0,1): That's OUR OWN BODY (next segment)! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- LEFT to (-1,2): OFF BOARD! \u274c DEATH!\n- RIGHT to (1,2): Cell empty? Board shows '.' at (1,2) \u2705\n\nSAFE MOVES: UP and RIGHT.\n\nENEMY PREDICTION:\nEnemy head (6,8). Possible moves:\nUP to (6,9): Apple at (6,9)? Board shows 'A' there! \ud83c\udf4e\nDOWN to (6,7): Empty '.' \u2705\nLEFT to (5,8): Their own body (segment 2) \u274c\nRIGHT to (7,8): Empty '.' \u2705\n\nThey'll likely go UP for the apple (6,9) to grow to length 8! Or maybe DOWN/RIGHT for positioning. Their move won't directly hit us this turn \u2014 too far.\n\nSTRATEGIC CHOICE:\nUP to (0,3): Moves us along left wall, opens future UP (0,4) or RIGHT (1,3). Keeps us near top-left apples maybe? But we're short, enemy is long \u2014 need to avoid getting encircled.\nRIGHT to (1,2): Moves toward center, opens UP (1,3), RIGHT (2,2) (our own tail? Wait, tail is at (2,2) now, but next turn after moving, tail moves? Let's simulate: if we move RIGHT, new head (1,2), body becomes [(0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)] \u2014 tail stays (2,2) for now. Next turn from (1,2), UP (1,3) safe, RIGHT (2,2) is our tail \u2014 that's safe IF tail moves away first? Actually, simultaneous movement: tail only moves if we DON'T eat an apple. We have no apple at (1,2), so we don't grow, tail moves forward. So (2,2) becomes empty after tail moves! So RIGHT to (2,2) next turn could be safe! That gives options.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\nEnemy is longer \u2014 avoid head-on until we match length. We need apples! Check apple list: closest apples to us: (0,0) below but blocked by body, (2,6), (3,2), (2,0). We should maneuver toward (3,2) or (2,6) while boxing enemy? Enemy is top-right \u2014 maybe we claim bottom-left and center.\n\nRIGHT seems better \u2014 gets us toward center apples (3,2) and away from left wall trap. UP keeps us on edge with fewer exits.\n\nFINAL DECISION: Going RIGHT to (1,2) to gain board control and future options! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

We gotta play smart and AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP to (1,3): Board shows '.' \u2705 Empty!\n- DOWN to (1,1): That's OUR OWN BODY (segment 4 in our list? Wait, body: [(0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)] \u2014 yes (1,1) is our body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- LEFT to (0,2): That's our own PREVIOUS HEAD position? Actually, it's now our neck \u2014 it's our body segment right behind head! \u274c CAN'T GO BACKWARDS INTO OWN BODY!\n- RIGHT to (2,2): Board shows '.' \u2705 Empty!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP and RIGHT only!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy head (7,8), body: [(6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)]\nPossible moves:\nUP to (7,9): Empty '.' \u2705\nDOWN to (7,7): Empty '.' \u2705\nLEFT to (6,8): His own body \u274c\nRIGHT to (8,8): Empty '.' \u2705\n\nHe might go for apple at (9,8) soon, or (6,9) is already eaten? Wait, apple list shows (6,9) but board at row 8 col 6 shows 'T'? Actually board row 8: \". . . A . T T 1 . A\" \u2014 so (6,8) is enemy body 'T', (7,8) is head '1', (6,9) is apple 'A' above that? Row 9: \". . . A . . A . . .\" \u2014 (6,9) is 'A' yes. He could go UP from (7,8) to (7,9) then next turn LEFT to (6,9) for apple. He's long, might play safe.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**\nOur possible heads: (1,3) or (2,2). His possible heads: (7,9), (7,7), (8,8). No overlap this turn \u2014 safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nWe're shorter \u2014 need apples! Closest apples: (3,2) is 2 right, 0 down from (1,2)? Actually (3,2) is at x=3,y=2. From (1,2) \u2192 (3,2) is 2 right. From (2,2) \u2192 (3,2) is 1 right. So moving RIGHT gets us closer!\nAlso (2,6) is up-right, (3,8) far. (0,0) is blocked by our tail soon? Tail at (2,1) moving... if we move RIGHT, tail moves to (0,1)? Wait, body after moving: new head (2,2), body becomes [(1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)] \u2014 tail is (2,1), next turn tail moves to (0,2)? Actually snake movement: head goes to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, last segment (tail) is removed unless we ate apple. So tail (2,1) disappears, new tail becomes (0,1)? Let's track: current body: [(0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)], head moves to (2,2), new body: [(1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1)] \u2014 yes tail is (1,1). So (0,0) becomes accessible later maybe.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS:**\nIf we go UP to (1,3): next turn from there, UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2) safe? (1,2) will be empty (our old head), LEFT (0,3) empty, RIGHT (2,3) empty \u2014 3 options.\nIf we go RIGHT to (2,2): next turn from there, UP (2,3), DOWN (2,1) empty (tail moved), LEFT (1,2) empty, RIGHT (3,2) \u2014 which is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e That's huge! So RIGHT sets up an apple grab next turn if we go RIGHT again! That's the play!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGet that apple at (3,2) next turn! Then we'll be length 6 vs enemy maybe 7. Keep pushing center, maybe trap enemy against top wall later. Avoid head-on until length matched. Enemy is top-right \u2014 we dominate bottom-left and center. Keep options open, don't get pinned on edges.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT to (2,2) to line up that apple grab and control center! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy head at **(8,8)**, length 7 (6 apples + head). He's LONGER! We need to GROW and BOX HIM IN!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (2,2):**\n- **UP to (2,3):** Board shows '.' \u2705 Empty!\n- **DOWN to (2,1):** That's our **TAIL!** Wait, current tail is (1,1). After we move, tail shifts. But (2,1) is currently **empty** on board! \u2705 Actually safe! Because our body list shows (2,1) is NOT there \u2014 our last segment is (1,1). YES, (2,1) is free! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (1,2):** That's our **NECK** \u2014 our own body segment right behind head! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- **RIGHT to (3,2):** That's an **APPLE 'A'**! \ud83c\udf4e And it's safe? Board at (3,2) shows 'A', not a snake body. \u2705\n\n**SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.** THREE OPTIONS! NICE!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (8,8). Possible moves:\n- UP (8,9): '.' empty \u2705\n- DOWN (8,7): '.' empty \u2705\n- LEFT (7,8): His own body 'T' \u274c\n- RIGHT (9,8): Apple 'A' \u2705\n\nHe might go for apple at (9,8) or (7,9)? Actually (7,9) is '.' empty. He could go UP then LEFT for (6,9) apple next turn. He's long, might avoid risky head-on.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**\nOur possible heads: (2,3), (2,1), (3,2).\nHis possible heads: (8,9), (8,7), (9,8).\nNo overlap this turn. SAFE.\n\n**STRATEGIC APPLE GRAB:** RIGHT to (3,2) gets us an APPLE IMMEDIATELY! \ud83d\ude80 That grows us to length 6 (5 body + head). Enemy length 7. We close the gap!\n\n**BUT IS RIGHT SMART LONG-TERM?** From (3,2) after eating apple (so we grow, tail doesn't move), our body will be: new head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1) \u2014 tail stays at (1,1). Then next turn from (3,2), possible moves: UP (3,3) '.' empty, DOWN (3,1) '.' empty, LEFT (2,2) our own body \u274c, RIGHT (4,2) '.' empty. We'll have 3 safe moves. Good options!\n\n**WHAT ABOUT UP to (2,3)?** That's safe, but misses the apple. From there next turn, we could go RIGHT to (3,3) or LEFT to (1,3) etc. Keeps us flexible but doesn't grow.\n\n**DOWN to (2,1)?** Puts us near bottom wall, limits options. From (2,1) next turn: DOWN (2,0) is apple 'A', but left/right/up might be tighter. Could be a trap.\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** We need to **CATCH UP IN LENGTH** to challenge him! Right now, head-on collision we lose (he's longer). So grab that apple! RIGHT is AGGRESSIVE and SMART! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating apple at (3,2), we'll be length 6 vs his 7. Next turn, assess his move. Possibly push toward center (4,3) area to control board. Watch if he goes for (9,8) apple \u2014 that could stretch him along top edge. We might try to trap him later. Keep options open, avoid dead ends.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT gets us the apple, grows us, keeps good future options. LET'S FEAST! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

WE NEED MULTIPLE APPLES QUICK!\n\nAFTER MOVING RIGHT TO (6,3), NEXT TURN WE CAN GO UP TO (6,4) FOR ANOTHER APPLE, OR RIGHT TO (7,3) FOR YET ANOTHER! OUR BODY EXPANDS, BLOCKING MORE SPACE. ENEMY'S LONG BODY FORMS A WALL IN THE TOP-RIGHT \u2014 WE STAY BELOW AND COLLECT APPLES IN THE CENTER/RIGHT BEFORE HE SWEEPS THEM!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\n1. EAT (6,3) NOW \u2014 GROW TO 7!\n2. NEXT TURN FROM (6,3), TARGET (6,4) OR (7,3) DEPENDING ON ENEMY'S NEW HEAD (LIKELY (7,6)). AVOID HEAD-ON COLLISIONS UNTIL WE MATCH LENGTH!\n3. IF ENEMY HEADS DOWN FROM (7,6) TOWARD (7,5)/(7,4), WE MAY COMPETE FOR (7,4) \u2014 BUT PRIORITIZE SAFETY AND MULTIPLE ESCAPE ROUTES!\n4. ONCE WE TIE LENGTH, LOOK FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE EQUAL OR GREATER LENGTH!\n5. KEEP AN EYE ON LEFT-SIDE APPLES (E.G., (3,5), (2,6)) FOR LATER IF RIGHT SIDE GETS TOO RISKY!\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE APPLE \u2014 AGGRESSIVE GROWTH IS KEY! RIGHT GETS US CONTENT AND KEEPS THE PRESSURE ON! LET'S COOK! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

DOUBLE KO BUT HE WINS ON SCORE! \ud83d\ude31\n- IF WE GO RIGHT TO (7,4) AND HE GOES DOWN TO (7,4) \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! SAME OUTCOME, WE LOSE! \ud83d\udeab\n- IF WE GO LEFT TO (5,4), NO COLLISION POSSIBLE THIS TURN! SAFEST AVOIDANCE! \u2705\n\nWE CAN'T RISK A HEAD-ON WHEN WE'RE SHORTER! CHAT, WE GOTTA DODGE AND LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY! LEFT TO (5,4) IS THE ONLY MOVE THAT AVOIDS POSSIBLE HEAD-ON COLLISION! PLUS IT MOVES US TOWARD LEFT-SIDE APPLES LIKE (3,5), (2,6), (4,4)! STRATEGIC RETREAT! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\n1. GO LEFT TO (5,4) THIS TURN \u2014 AVOID COLLISION, STAY ALIVE!\n2. NEXT TURN FROM (5,4), ASSESS ENEMY'S NEW HEAD. IF HE ATE (6,5) OR (7,4), HE'LL BE LONGER, BUT WE CAN FARM LEFT SIDE SAFELY!\n3. TARGET APPLES AT (4,4), (3,5), (2,6), (3,8) \u2014 ENEMY IS TOP-RIGHT, WE CAN GROW IN PEACE!\n4. ONCE WE MATCH LENGTH (GET TO 10), LOOK FOR HEAD-ON OPPORTUNITIES OR BOX HIM INTO HIS CORNER!\n5. AVOID GOING RIGHT TOWARD ENEMY UNTIL WE'RE EQUAL OR LONGER!\n\nLEFT IS THE SMART PLAY! LIVE TO GROW, DOMINATE LATER! LET'S COOK! \ud83c\udf73\n\nLEFT",

(7,2) is in his body list.\n- DOWN to (7,0): \u2705 SAFE, NO APPLE.\n- LEFT to (6,1): \u2705 SAFE, NO APPLE.\n- RIGHT to (8,1): \u2705 SAFE, NO APPLE.\n\nHE HAS NO NEARBY APPLES FROM (7,1)! APPLE AT (7,1) IS GONE SINCE HE'S ON IT? WAIT, APPLE DROPS LIST HAS (7,1)? NO, CHECK LIST: (0,0),(5,5)... NO (7,1). SO HE'S ON EMPTY CELL. HE MIGHT MOVE TOWARD APPLES LIKE (9,4) OR (9,5) TO THE RIGHT-UP.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING:\n- UP (3,6): TAKES US CLOSER TO APPLES AT (2,6) AND (3,8). KEEPS US IN CENTRAL COLUMN. BUT NEXT TURN FROM (3,6): OPTIONS UP (3,7), LEFT (2,6) APPLE, RIGHT (4,6). DOWN (3,5) WOULD BE OUR NECK? OUR BODY MOVES, SO (3,5) BECOMES NECK NEXT TURN - DOWN RISKY NEXT TURN. BUT UP GIVES US FLEXIBILITY.\n- LEFT (2,5): TAKES US CLOSER TO APPLE AT (2,6) UP AND (1,3) DOWN? ACTUALLY (1,3) IS FAR. NEXT TURN FROM (2,5): OPTIONS UP (2,6) APPLE, DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5). SOLID MOVE.\n- RIGHT (4,5): TAKES US CLOSER TO APPLE AT (5,5). NEXT TURN FROM (4,5): OPTIONS UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4) OUR BODY? CHECK: OUR BODY SEGMENTS: (3,4) NECK, THEN (4,4), (5,4)... SO (4,4) IS OUR BODY! DOWN INTO (4,4) NEXT TURN WOULD BE SUICIDE! SO RIGHT MIGHT LIMIT DOWN MOVES NEXT TURN.\n\nENEMY'S BODY IS LONG (LENGTH 13) AND COILED ON RIGHT SIDE. WE NEED TO EXPAND LEFT/UP TO BOX HIM IN! HE'S NEAR BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER. IF WE GO UP OR LEFT, WE CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTE TO TOP-LEFT APPLES!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\n- KEEP GROWING SAFELY! CATCH UP TO HIS LENGTH (13 vs 10). ONCE LENGTHS EQUAL, LOOK FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION IF WE HAVE MORE APPLES (WE WILL IF WE KEEP EATING!).\n- USE OUR BODY AS A WALL TO TRAP HIM AGAINST THE RIGHT EDGE. MOVE TOWARD (2,6) APPLE NEXT.\n- AVOID GETTING TRAPPED BY HIS LONG BODY NEAR (6,8)-(9,8) AREA.\n\nLEFT IS AGGRESSIVE TOWARD APPLE AT (2,6) AND OPENS UP SPACE! UP IS ALSO GOOD BUT LEFT FEELS MORE CONTROLLING! LET'S GO LEFT TO DOMINATE THE LEFT SIDE AND PRESSURE HIM! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",
