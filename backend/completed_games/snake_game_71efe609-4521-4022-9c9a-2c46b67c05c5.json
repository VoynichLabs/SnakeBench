          "rationale": "Let me analyze my current situation:\n\nI'm now at position (0, 0) - the bottom-left corner of the board. My body is at [(0, 1), (0, 2)]. Great! I successfully collected the apple that was at (0, 0) and now have 1 point.\n\nCurrent apple positions: (5, 8), (1, 6), (8, 3), (0, 8), (2, 3)\n\nFrom my current position (0, 0), let me check my possible moves:\n- UP to (0, 1) - DEATH! This is where my body is located\n- DOWN - DEATH! This would take me to (0, -1) which is outside the board\n- LEFT - DEATH! This would take me to (-1, 0) which is outside the board  \n- RIGHT to (1, 0) - This is my only safe option!\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (4, 9) with body at [(4, 8), (4, 7)], so they're still far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 0) will:\n1. Keep me alive (it's the only legal move)\n2. Get me out of the corner\n3. Start positioning me toward other apples\n\nStrategy for future turns: After moving to (1, 0), I'll have more options. I can continue RIGHT along the bottom edge toward the center, or I can move UP to start heading toward apples like (1, 6) or (2, 3). The apple at (1, 6) is particularly attractive since it's directly above where I'll be in a few moves. I need to be efficient in my pathing and avoid getting trapped again.\n\nRIGHT"
