I'll be at the edge of the apple cluster in this area, so I'll need to decide whether to continue exploring or head toward other apples like the ones at (6, 5), (6, 7), or (9, 0).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (4, 2), assess the safest path to the remaining apples. The apple at (6, 5) might be a good next target since it's relatively close and the enemy snake seems focused on the top area of the board.\n\nRIGHT"

I'm already committed to this path and very close\n2. It's the most direct route to guaranteed points\n3. After getting this apple, I can potentially move east to collect (5, 1) and (6, 1) before the enemy snake gets them\n4. The enemy snake seems to be focusing on the eastern apples, so grabbing (4, 1) first gives me a good foundation\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (4, 2), I'll be just one move away from the apple at (4, 1). Next turn I should move DOWN again to collect that apple, then consider moving RIGHT to grab the apples at (5, 1) and (6, 1) if they're still available.\n\nDOWN"

However, I need to check if there's a clear path all the way up. Looking at the board, I can see my body segments are at various positions, and I need to make sure I don't box myself in.\n\nFrom the board representation, it looks like there might be some of my body segments (T) in the upper areas around y=5 and y=6, so I need to be careful about my route.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 3), I'd be moving away from the apple but potentially creating more maneuvering room.\n\nGiven that my goal is the apple at (3, 8) and I can see the path upward appears clear for at least the next few moves, I should continue UP. This keeps me on the most direct path to the apple while maintaining distance from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving toward apple (3, 8) by going up the left side. Monitor for any body segments that might block the path and be prepared to navigate around them if needed.\n\nUP"

Keeps me alive\n2. Gives me more central positioning for future moves\n3. Starts to create a path that could eventually loop around to reach apples\n4. Maintains distance from the enemy snake\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue navigating around the bottom/left side of my body segments to create a path that can eventually curve back up toward the apples at (3, 8) or (4, 9).

The only hope is to slip into the tail cell at (6,1) just as it moves away. That frees us up next turn into the open central area, from which we can turn northward toward the high-value apples up top.\n\nNext-turn strategy: once we escape into the center, sweep upward and left to get (4,9) & (3,8), then over to (8,9).\n\nMy move: DOWN"
