Moving **RIGHT** towards (3, 8) keeps a reasonable distance, reducing the risk of early encounters. However, staying centralized or moving towards **DOWN** also offers flexibility without immediate threats.\n\n- **Self-Collision:** Moving **LEFT** is prohibited as it leads directly into the snake's own body, resulting in instant death.\n\n- **Wall Boundaries:** All safe moves (**UP**, **RIGHT**, **DOWN**) keep the snake within the 10x10 grid, avoiding wall collisions.\n\n- **Apple Proximity:** \n  - Moving **DOWN** towards (2,7) brings the snake closer to apples at (3,7) and (5,7), maximizing scoring opportunities.\n  - Moving **RIGHT** towards (3,8) positions the snake nearer to the central and right-side apples, facilitating multiple collection paths.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n- **Immediate Goal:** Prioritize collecting nearby apples to maximize score while maintaining safety from the enemy snake.\n  \n- **Long-Term Planning:** Aim to position the snake in a centralized location, offering flexibility to navigate towards various apples and evade potential threats from enemy snakes.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**\n\nAfter evaluating the pros and cons, moving **DOWN** to (2, 7) emerges as the optimal choice.

Although it brings your snake closer to the enemy, careful monitoring in the next move can mitigate potential risks. The immediate gain from consuming the apple outweighs the relatively low-risk of potential future conflicts, especially since the enemy snake's current trajectory does not pose an immediate threat.\n\n**Next Move:** **RIGHT**"

This would give me a point and grow my snake. Perfect!\n- DOWN to (3, 5) - This would run into my own body segment (my neck), so this would kill me\n- LEFT to (2, 6) - This is valid but takes me away from the apple that's right above me\n- RIGHT to (4, 6) - This is valid but also takes me away from the apple that's right above me\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at position (3, 7) according to the board display, but wait - that's exactly where the apple is that I want to collect! Looking more carefully at the board, I see \"1\" at position (3, 7), which means the enemy snake's head is there. But there's also an \"A\" shown at (5, 7), (7, 5), (9, 4), and (1, 2).\n\nActually, let me re-read this more carefully. The board shows:\n- Position (3, 7) has \"1\" which represents enemy snake #1's head\n- The apple that was at (3, 7) appears to have been collected by the enemy snake\n\nWait, I need to look at this again. The enemy snake positions show Snake #1 at position (3, 7) with body at [(2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8)]. This means the enemy snake moved to (3, 7) and likely collected the apple there.\n\nGiven this situation, moving UP to (3, 7) would mean colliding with the enemy snake's head, which would kill me.\n\nMy best options now are:\n- LEFT to (2, 6) - Safe move, gets me away from the enemy snake\n- RIGHT to (4, 6) - Safe move, and positions me better to go after other apples\n\nSince the apple at (3, 7) is no longer available, I should pivot to targeting other apples.

However, I should also consider the positioning this gives me for future moves and whether the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1, 9) with body at [(0, 9), (0, 8)], so it's still in the top-left corner and not an immediate threat.\n\nI think the best strategy is to go for the apple at (3, 7) since it's in a straight line from my current position. This will take me 5 moves (from y=2 to y=7), but it's the most direct path to a guaranteed apple.\n\nStrategy for future turns: After getting the apple at (3, 7), I should evaluate going for either (5, 7) which would be close by, or heading toward the center/right side of the board for the other apples.\n\nUP"

Additionally, it preserves future movement options, allowing for strategic positioning to collect apples while minimizing the chances of getting trapped.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turns:**\n- **Maintain Safety:** Continue navigating the upper sections of the board to stay clear of the enemy snake\u2019s path.\n- **Plan Apple Collection:** From the elevated position, chart a path towards nearby apples, ensuring that each move keeps multiple options open.\n- **Monitor Enemy Movements:** Stay aware of the enemy snake\u2019s trajectory to anticipate and avoid potential conflicts.\n- **Optimize Growth:** Prioritize collecting apples that enhance the snake's length without compromising safety or flexibility.\n\n**Next Move:** **UP**"

My previous move UP was successful and I'm now just one move away from the apple at (3, 7)!\n\nLet me analyze my current options from position (3, 6):\n- UP to (3, 7) - This is where the apple is! This would give me a point and grow my snake. Perfect!\n- DOWN to (3, 5) - This would run into my own body segment (my neck), so this would kill me\n- LEFT to (2, 6) - This is valid but takes me away from the apple that's right above me\n- RIGHT to (4, 6) - This is valid but also takes me away from the apple that's right above me\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at position (3, 7) according to the board display, but wait - that's exactly where the apple is that I want to collect! Looking more carefully at the board, I see \"1\" at position (3, 7), which means the enemy snake's head is there. But there's also an \"A\" shown at (5, 7), (7, 5), (9, 4), and (1, 2).\n\nActually, let me re-read this more carefully. The board shows:\n- Position (3, 7) has \"1\" which represents enemy snake #1's head\n- The apple that was at (3, 7) appears to have been collected by the enemy snake\n\nWait, I need to look at this again. The enemy snake positions show Snake #1 at position (3, 7) with body at [(2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8)]. This means the enemy snake moved to (3, 7) and likely collected the apple there.\n\nGiven this situation, moving UP to (3, 7) would mean colliding with the enemy snake's head, which would kill me.\n\nMy best options now are:\n- LEFT to (2, 6) - Safe move, gets me away from the enemy snake\n- RIGHT to (4, 6) - Safe move, and positions me better to go after other apples\n\nSince the apple at (3, 7) is no longer available, I should pivot to targeting other apples. The apple at (5, 5) is relatively close, and moving RIGHT would position me better to reach it. From (4, 6), I could then move RIGHT again to (5, 6) and then DOWN to (5, 5).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move RIGHT to avoid the enemy snake, then work toward collecting the apple at (5, 5) or (5, 7). Keep monitoring enemy snake movements to avoid collisions.\n\nRIGHT"

However, I should also consider the positioning this gives me for future moves and whether the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1, 9) with body at [(0, 9), (0, 8)], so it's still in the top-left corner and not an immediate threat.\n\nI think the best strategy is to go for the apple at (3, 7) since it's in a straight line from my current position. This will take me 5 moves (from y=2 to y=7), but it's the most direct path to a guaranteed apple.\n\nStrategy for future turns: After getting the apple at (3, 7), I should evaluate going for either (5, 7) which would be close by, or heading toward the center/right side of the board for the other apples.\n\nUP"

It doesn't pose an immediate threat to my route to (7, 1).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (7, 3) is clearly the best move because:\n1. It's safe - no collision with walls, my body, or enemy snake\n2. It progresses directly toward the closest apple at (7, 1)\n3. It maintains good positioning on the board\n4. The entire column 7 appears clear for my descent\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving DOWN toward (7, 1). After collecting that apple, reassess the board and likely target either (1, 2) or (2, 2) depending on the enemy snake's position and movement pattern.\n\nDOWN"

Once I collect the apple at (0, 1), I'll grow and be in perfect position to grab the other apples at (1, 2) and (2, 2).\n\n**Decision:**\nContinue LEFT to (3, 0). This maintains my direct path to the apple cluster and keeps me safe on the bottom edge.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Keep moving LEFT until I reach x=0, then move UP to collect the apple at (0, 1). After that, work on collecting the other left-side apples at (1, 2) and (2, 2).\n\nLEFT"

My previous move UP was successful and I'm now just one move away from the apple at (3, 7)!\n\nLet me analyze my current options from position (3, 6):\n- UP to (3, 7) - This is where the apple is! This would give me a point and grow my snake. Perfect!\n- DOWN to (3, 5) - This would run into my own body segment (my neck), so this would kill me\n- LEFT to (2, 6) - This is valid but takes me away from the apple that's right above me\n- RIGHT to (4, 6) - This is valid but also takes me away from the apple that's right above me\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at position (3, 7) according to the board display, but wait - that's exactly where the apple is that I want to collect! Looking more carefully at the board, I see \"1\" at position (3, 7), which means the enemy snake's head is there. But there's also an \"A\" shown at (5, 7), (7, 5), (9, 4), and (1, 2).\n\nActually, let me re-read this more carefully. The board shows:\n- Position (3, 7) has \"1\" which represents enemy snake #1's head\n- The apple that was at (3, 7) appears to have been collected by the enemy snake\n\nWait, I need to look at this again. The enemy snake positions show Snake #1 at position (3, 7) with body at [(2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8)]. This means the enemy snake moved to (3, 7) and likely collected the apple there.\n\nGiven this situation, moving UP to (3, 7) would mean colliding with the enemy snake's head, which would kill me.\n\nMy best options now are:\n- LEFT to (2, 6) - Safe move, gets me away from the enemy snake\n- RIGHT to (4, 6) - Safe move, and positions me better to go after other apples\n\nSince the apple at (3, 7) is no longer available, I should pivot to targeting other apples. The apple at (5, 5) is relatively close, and moving RIGHT would position me better to reach it. From (4, 6), I could then move RIGHT again to (5, 6) and then DOWN to (5, 5).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move RIGHT to avoid the enemy snake, then work toward collecting the apple at (5, 5) or (5, 7). Keep monitoring enemy snake movements to avoid collisions.\n\nRIGHT"

Looking at the remaining apples:\n- (7, 5) - middle right area  \n- (9, 4) - far right side\n- (5, 5) - center area\n- (3, 7) - directly above me in the same column\n- (5, 7) - upper center area\n\nThe apple at (3, 7) is directly above me, which makes it an attractive target since I can reach it by going straight up. However, I should also consider the positioning this gives me for future moves and whether the enemy snake might interfere.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1, 9) with body at [(0, 9), (0, 8)], so it's still in the top-left corner and not an immediate threat.\n\nI think the best strategy is to go for the apple at (3, 7) since it's in a straight line from my current position. This will take me 5 moves (from y=2 to y=7), but it's the most direct path to a guaranteed apple.\n\nStrategy for future turns: After getting the apple at (3, 7), I should evaluate going for either (5, 7) which would be close by, or heading toward the center/right side of the board for the other apples.\n\nUP"

This move positions your snake closer to the apple at (0, 7), enabling its collection in the next turn. While being on the edge does limit some movement options, proactively approaching an apple can lead to point gains that are crucial for winning the game.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turns:**\n- **Apple Collection:** After moving left, proceed to move **DOWN** to (0, 7) to collect the apple. This will grant you an extra point and extend your snake.\n- **Avoid Traps:** Ensure that each subsequent move maintains ample space to prevent the snake from becoming trapped, especially after growing in length.\n- **Monitor Enemy Movement:** Keep an eye on the enemy snake's trajectory to avoid potential collisions and anticipate their moves towards other apples.\n\n**Next Move:** **LEFT**"

The enemy snake positions show Snake #1 at position (3, 7) with body at [(2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8)]. This means the enemy snake moved to (3, 7) and likely collected the apple there.\n\nGiven this situation, moving UP to (3, 7) would mean colliding with the enemy snake's head, which would kill me.\n\nMy best options now are:\n- LEFT to (2, 6) - Safe move, gets me away from the enemy snake\n- RIGHT to (4, 6) - Safe move, and positions me better to go after other apples\n\nSince the apple at (3, 7) is no longer available, I should pivot to targeting other apples.

This move positions your snake closer to the apple at (0, 7), allowing you to collect it in the following turn. Additionally, being on the left edge can be advantageous for accessing multiple apple locations with careful navigation.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turns:**\n- **Apple Collection:** After moving left, proceed to move **DOWN** to (0, 7) to collect the apple. This will not only grant you an extra point but also extend your snake, necessitating mindful navigation to avoid self-collisions.\n- **Monitor Enemy Movement:** Keep an eye on the enemy snake's trajectory to ensure it doesn't block your path to apples or corner your snake.\n- **Maintain Flexibility:** Ensure that each move maintains ample space for future navigation, preventing the snake from becoming trapped, especially after growing in length.\n\n**Next Move:** **LEFT**"

I have a completely clear path.\n\nI notice there's also an apple at (2, 2) which is directly above my current position. However, sticking to my original plan to get (0, 1) first is still optimal because:\n1. It's part of a systematic sweep of the left side\n2. After getting (0, 1), I'll be perfectly positioned to get (1, 2) and then (2, 2)\n3. The enemy snake shows no signs of moving toward this area\n\n**Decision:**\nContinue LEFT to (1, 0). This maintains my direct path to the nearest apple and keeps me safe on the bottom edge.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Move LEFT to (0, 0), then UP to (0, 1) to collect the first apple. After growing, systematically collect the remaining left-cluster apples at (1, 2) and (2, 2) while monitoring the enemy snake's position.\n\nLEFT"
