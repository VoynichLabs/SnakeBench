The enemy snake is way over at (0, 0), so we're not in immediate danger of a head-on collision yet. That's good news!\n\nFirst thing's first \u2013 we gotta check all four directions:\n- UP: That would take us to (9, 3). Is that safe? The board looks clear there. No snakes nearby. \u2714\ufe0f\n- DOWN: That goes to (9, 1). Hmm, the board state shows an 'A' at (9, 1)? Wait, looking at the board representation... row 1 shows \"A . . A . . A A . .\" for x=0 to 9. So at x=9, y=1, that's a '.'! It's empty! So DOWN is safe too. \u2714\ufe0f\n- LEFT: That's (8, 2). Also empty. \u2714\ufe0f\n- RIGHT: Can't go RIGHT, we're already at x=9! That's off the board. \u274c\n\nSo all moves except RIGHT are safe from immediate death.\n\nNow, strategy. We wanna grow and dominate. The closest apples are at (8, 0) and (8, 8). (8, 0) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance \u2013 only 3 moves away (LEFT, LEFT, DOWN). (8, 8) is farther. But going for the closest apple might lead us into a corner? We gotta think long-term.\n\nThe enemy is at (0, 0). They'll probably head towards the apple at (0, 1) or (0, 3)? But we're far apart. Right now, our priority should be to start growing our body to control space. Since we're on the right edge, moving LEFT opens up the board and gives us more options. Moving DOWN gets us closer to that (8, 0) apple, but then we're along the bottom edge \u2013 could be risky later.\n\nActually, wait... Let's be aggressive! If we move LEFT to (8, 2), we're centrally positioned and can then go DOWN towards (8, 0) or UP towards other apples. That seems smart \u2013 it keeps our options open.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move towards the center-left to control space and path towards apples at (8,0) and others. Avoid getting trapped on the edges. Watch for the enemy's likely path upwards from their corner.\n\nLEFT",

Safe.\n**LEFT**: (7, 2) \u2705 Empty. Safe.\n**RIGHT**: (9, 2) \u274c Wait, RIGHT? x=8+1=9, y=2. That's on the board! Check the board state: row 2 shows \"...A . 1 .\" and x=9,y=2 is '.'!

BUT if we go DOWN, next turn our head is at (8,1). Then we can go DOWN again to (8,0) for the apple! That's a clear 2-turn plan to get our first growth! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nIf we go LEFT to (7,2), we're further from immediate apples but more central. Hmm...\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Let's be AGGRESSIVE! Get that first apple ASAP to match the enemy's length. Then we can start thinking about boxing them in. The apple at (8,0) is RIGHT THERE. Let's go for it!\n\n**SHORT-TERM:** Move DOWN this turn to get closer to (8,0). Next turn, move DOWN again to eat it, unless something changes.\n\nDOWN",

Up to (7,3) empty, Down to (7,1) is my neck? Wait, my body is at (8,1), head at (7,1).

Let's trace: Head moves to (7,2), body follows: new segment at old head (7,1), tail (8,1) disappears? Wait, I haven't eaten an apple, so my tail moves. My body becomes [(7,2), (7,1)]. So next turn, down to (7,1) is my own body! \u274c So next turn, DOWN is blocked. But UP, LEFT, RIGHT are open? Left to (6,2) has an apple! Right to (8,2) empty. So UP now gives me options.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7,0):** Empty. Safe. Next moves? Down off board? \u274c No, (7,0) is bottom row. From (7,0): Up to (7,1) is my neck? After moving, body: [(7,0), (7,1)]. So next turn, Up to (7,1) is my body \u274c. Left to (6,0) empty. Right to (8,0) has apple! So next turn, only LEFT and RIGHT are safe? That's risky, limits options.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6,1):** APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it! I grow to length 3! Safe cell. Next moves? After eating, body: [(6,1), (7,1), (8,1)].\n    - Next turn from (6,1): Up to (6,2) has apple! Down to (6,0) empty. Left to (5,1) empty. Right to (7,1) is my body \u274c. So three safe options! Good mobility.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8,1):** My own body! \u274c DEAD. Can't do that.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** Enemy at (0,3). Their possible moves: UP (0,4), RIGHT (1,3). My moves:\n- My UP (7,2): No collision.\n- My DOWN (7,0): No collision.\n- My LEFT (6,1): No collision.\nNo head-on risk this turn. Safe.\n\n**WHICH MOVE IS BEST?** \n- LEFT (6,1) gets me an apple, grows to length 3 (same as enemy!), and keeps good options next turn. I move towards the center and closer to enemy? Actually, enemy is far left, I'm moving left towards them slightly. But more importantly, apple!\n- UP (7,2) doesn't get apple, but keeps me central. \n- DOWN (7,0) gets no apple, traps me on bottom edge with fewer options next turn.\n\nAGGRO PLAY: I need to match enemy length to contest head-ons. LEFT gets the apple and growth! Also, after eating, next turn I can go LEFT again to (5,1) or UP to (6,2) for another apple! That's content! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After this, pressure the enemy by moving left/up to cut off their space. Force them into a corner! With equal length, I can threaten head-on collisions if I position correctly.\n\nLEFT IS THE MOVE! LET'S GROW AND DOMINATE! \ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

LET'S GOOO! I'm length 3, enemy is ALSO length 3. Score is TIED 2-2. This is a real match now! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:** Snake #0 head at (1,3), body at [(0,3), (0,2)]. They're still chilling on the left edge.\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS: WHERE IS THE ENEMY GOING?**\nFrom (1,3):\n*   UP to (1,4): Empty. Safe.\n*   DOWN to (1,2): Empty. Safe.\n*   LEFT to (0,3): Their own body! \u274c INSTANT DEATH. They won't do that.\n*   RIGHT to (2,3): Empty, AND it has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nSo their SAFE moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT (which gets them an apple). They are 100% going for that RIGHT move to (2,3) for the apple and growth! They'd be crazy not to! So I'm PREDICTING their next head position will be (2,3).\n\n**CHECKING MY MOVES FROM (6,1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6,2):** APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it! I grow to length 4, taking the lead! Is it safe? Cell is empty. But wait... HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? Enemy might go RIGHT to (2,3), I'm going UP to (6,2). No collision. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (6,0):** Empty. Safe. Head-on risk? Enemy to (2,3) is far away. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (5,1):** Empty. Safe. Head-on risk? No. Safe. BUT... this moves me away from the cluster of apples near me.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7,1):** My own body! \u274c DEAD. Can't do that.\n\nSo all moves except RIGHT are safe.

But I'M STILL LONGER because I eat first? Wait, simultaneous moves. We both grow this turn if we both eat. So we'd be tied at 3\u21924. But crucially, from (6,2) I have great options: UP to (6,3), LEFT to (5,2), RIGHT to (7,2). I'm positioned to move towards the center and cut off the enemy's expansion.\n*   **DOWN (6,0):** No apple. I stay at length 3 while they likely grow to 4. I fall behind! And I'm on the bottom edge with fewer options. From (6,0): UP is my body, LEFT (5,0) is open, RIGHT (7,0) is open. That's a trap! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (5,1):** No apple. I also fall behind. From (5,1): UP (5,2), DOWN (5,0), LEFT (4,1). Okay options, but I'm ceding initiative and growth.\n\n**THE PLAY:** UP is the ONLY move that keeps me ahead (or at least tied) on growth and positions me aggressively. We need to pressure! With equal or greater length, we can start threatening head-on collisions. My long-term plan is to move UP/LEFT after this to get between the enemy and the center of the board, slowly boxing them against the left wall. We want to limit their space and force a mistake!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:** UP FOR THE APPLE AND BOARD CONTROL! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Going DOWN to (5,2) is AGGRESSIVE! It keeps us right on their tail! We're both alive, and next turn we're adjacent again, but we have more control! We can pressure them towards the bottom wall! LET'S STAY AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udc4a\n\n**THE GAMBLE:** We're betting they'll take the safe move DOWN. If they do, we're golden. If they for some reason go UP, we get a head-on collision and lose.
