LEFT is deadly.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nSnake #0 at (7, 7) with body at (8, 7). The enemy might go for the apple at (7, 6) which is directly below its head. The enemy is far from me, no collision risk.\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\n- The apple at (0, 7) is directly above me - I can reach it in 3 moves by going straight up\n- My path: (0, 4) \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 (0, 6) \u2192 (0, 7)\n- After collecting (0, 7), I can go for (1, 9) which is nearby (just 1 right, 2 up)\n- The enemy will likely take (7, 6) this turn or next\n\n**Evaluating moves:**\n- UP (0, 5): Continues toward the apple at (0, 7). Direct progress toward nearest uncontested apple. Good!\n- DOWN (0, 3): Moves away from apples, wastes time\n- RIGHT (1, 4): Moves toward center but delays reaching (0, 7)\n\n**Follow-up from (0, 5):**\n- Can go UP (toward apple at 0,7), DOWN (back), or RIGHT (3 safe options)\n- LEFT would still be deadly\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\nContinue going UP toward (0, 7). The path is clear: (0, 5) \u2192 (0, 6) \u2192 (0, 7). After collecting it, I'll have a body segment. Then head toward (1, 9) by going UP twice then RIGHT once, or RIGHT then UP.

From (1, 8), I can continue UP to get the apple next turn.\n- DOWN to (1, 6): Moves away from the nearest apple, not ideal.\n- RIGHT to (2, 7): Safe but doesn't progress toward any nearby apple.\n\n**After moving UP to (1, 8):**\n- My body will be at [(1, 7), (0, 7)]\n- From (1, 8), I can go:\n  - UP to (1, 9) - APPLE! Safe!\n  - RIGHT to (2, 8) - safe\n  - DOWN to (1, 7) - my body will be there, death\n  - LEFT to (0, 8) - safe\n\nSo after UP, I'll have 3 safe options including getting the apple at (1, 9).\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. This turn: UP to (1, 8)\n2. Next turn: UP to (1, 9) - collect apple! (Score: 3)\n3. Then consider heading toward (4, 3) in the center\n\nThe apple at (1, 9) is just 2 moves away and the enemy is nowhere near it. This is a safe path to increase my score.\n\nUP",

The enemy is in the center-right area, so left-side apples might be safer to pursue. Keep an eye on enemy movement to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Their body is at (2, 1), so they can't go RIGHT.

Death!\n- DOWN: Goes to (1, 3) - Need to check if safe\n- LEFT: Goes to (0, 4) - Need to check if safe\n- RIGHT: Goes to (2, 4) - Need to check if safe\n\nLet me check each safe direction:\n\n**DOWN to (1, 3):**\n- Is this my body? No\n- Is this enemy body? No\n- Is this off the board? No\n- Safe move!\n\n**LEFT to (0, 4):**\n- Is this my body? No\n- Is this enemy body? No\n- Is this off the board? No\n- Safe move!\n\n**RIGHT to (2, 4):**\n- Is this my body? No\n- Is this enemy body? No\n- Is this off the board? No\n- Safe move!\n\nSo UP is death, but DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are all safe.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nSnake #0 is at (1, 2). Their body includes (1, 1), so they can't go DOWN (into their own body). They could go:\n- UP to (1, 3) - safe for them\n- LEFT to (0, 2) - safe for them\n- RIGHT to (2, 2) - THEIR BODY IS THERE! Death for them!\n\nSo enemy can only go UP or LEFT.\n\n**Collision risk:**\n- If I go DOWN to (1, 3) and enemy goes UP to (1, 3), we both die in a head-on collision!\n- This is a real risk since (1, 3) is directly between us.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n\n- **DOWN to (1, 3):** Risk of head-on collision with enemy if they go UP. But no apple here.\n\n- **LEFT to (0, 4):** Safe, no collision risk. Moves me toward (0, 6) apple and (0, 9) apple. But I'm against the left wall.\n\n- **RIGHT to (2, 4):** Safe, no collision risk. Gives me more central positioning and keeps options open.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- (0, 6) is at distance 2 from my head at (1, 4): 1 left + 2 up\n- (0, 9) is at distance 6: 1 left + 5 up\n- (7, 8) is at distance 10: 6 right + 4 up\n- (9, 1) and (8, 2) are far away\n\n**Enemy strategy prediction:**\nThe enemy might go UP toward me, trying to cut me off, or LEFT to avoid me. Given they have apples at (9, 1) and (8, 2) on their side, they might also want to head RIGHT eventually, but they can't go RIGHT now (their body blocks).\n\nIf the enemy goes UP, and I go DOWN, we collide and BOTH die. Since I have 6 apples and they have 5, if we both die, I win! But that's risky if I'm wrong about their move.\n\n**Safest strategy:**\nLEFT or RIGHT avoids any collision risk with the enemy.\n\n- LEFT gets me closer to apples (0, 6) and (0, 9)\n- RIGHT keeps me more central\n\nI think LEFT is better because it moves me toward apples. From (0, 4), I can then go UP toward (0, 5), (0, 6) to get the apple.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. If I go LEFT to (0, 4), then:\n- My next options from (0, 4): UP to (0, 5), DOWN to (0, 3), RIGHT would be (1, 4) which will be my old body... wait, no. After this turn my body will be:\n  - Head: (0, 4)\n  - Body: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8)\n  - The tail (3, 8) falls off since I didn't eat an apple\n\nSo from (0, 4) next turn:\n- UP to (0, 5) - safe\n- DOWN to (0, 3) - safe\n- RIGHT to (1, 4) - my body! Death!\n- LEFT to (-1, 4) - off board! Death!\n\nSo if I go LEFT now, next turn I can only go UP or DOWN. That's limiting but not terrible.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 4):\n- My body would be: Head (2, 4), Body: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)\n- Next turn from (2, 4): UP to (2, 5), DOWN to (2, 3), RIGHT to (3, 4), LEFT to (1, 4) would be body\n- Three options next turn instead of two\n\nRIGHT gives me more flexibility. But LEFT moves me toward apples.\n\nActually, let me think about the overall plan:\n- If I go LEFT now, then UP, UP, I reach (0, 6) in 2 turns - apple!\n- If I go RIGHT now, I need 3+ turns to reach any apple\n\nI'll go LEFT to start heading toward the apples on the left side.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: LEFT to (0, 4)\n2. Next turn: UP to (0, 5)\n3. Turn after: UP to (0, 6) - get apple!\n4. Continue UP toward (0, 9) - get another apple!\n\nLEFT\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n\n**My position:** Head at (1, 4), Body extends up and then right\n**Enemy position:** Head at (1, 2), Body extends down and right\n\n**Possible moves from (1, 4):**\n- UP to (1, 5): MY BODY IS THERE! Death!\n- DOWN to (1, 3): Safe, but...\n- LEFT to (0, 4): Safe\n- RIGHT to (2, 4): Safe\n\n**Critical observation about DOWN:**\nThe enemy at (1, 2) can only go UP (to 1, 3) or LEFT (to 0, 2) - they can't go RIGHT (body at 2, 2) or DOWN (body at 1, 1).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 3) and enemy goes UP to (1, 3), we have a head-on collision and both die! While I'd technically win (6 apples vs 5), it's risky to bet on their move.\n\n**Evaluating safe options:**\n- LEFT to (0, 4): Moves me toward apples at (0, 6) and (0, 9). From there I can go UP toward those apples.\n- RIGHT to (2, 4): More central position but moves away from nearby apples.\n\n**Apple path planning:**\n- (0, 6) is just 2 moves away if I go LEFT then UP twice\n- (0, 9) is reachable after that\n- These are the closest apples to me\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: LEFT to (0, 4)\n2. Next: UP to (0, 5)\n3. Then: UP to (0, 6) - collect apple!\n4. Continue UP toward (0, 9) for another apple\n5. Watch enemy - they might head toward bottom-right apples\n\nLEFT",

Go UP toward me (aggressive play, or trying to get closer to upper apples)\n2. Go DOWN to (0, 1) to get more space and eventually head toward (9, 1) or (8, 2) apples\n\nIf enemy goes UP and I go DOWN, we collide at (0, 3). Both die, I win (6 vs 5 apples) but it's risky.\nIf enemy goes UP and I go UP, we both survive this turn.\nIf enemy goes DOWN, we both survive regardless of my move.\n\n**Future planning if I go UP to (0, 5):**\nFrom (0, 5):\n- UP to (0, 6) - gets the apple! Safe.\n- DOWN to (0, 4) - would be my body\n- LEFT to (-1, 5) - off board\n- RIGHT to (1, 5) - would be my body\n\nWait, let me check my body after this turn.

That's very limiting, but it leads directly to the apple.\n\nAfter getting the apple at (0, 6), my body will grow:\n- New head: (0, 6)\n- Body: (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)\n\nWait, that means (1, 6) is in my body. From (0, 6):\n- UP to (0, 7) - safe\n- DOWN to (0, 5) - my body!\n- LEFT to (-1, 6) - off board!\n- RIGHT to (1, 6) - my body!\n\nAgain only UP is safe. But that's okay because I'm heading toward (0, 9) anyway!\n\nThis is actually a good path - I'm essentially creating a \"corridor\" up the left side. Let me trace this:\n1. This turn: UP to (0, 5)\n2. Next turn: UP to (0, 6) - apple!\n3. Then: UP to (0, 7)\n4. Then: UP to (0, 8)\n5. Then: UP to (0, 9) - apple!\n\nBy the time I reach (0, 9), my tail will have moved enough that I should have options to turn right.\n\n**Checking if DOWN is better:**\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 3):\n- Risk of collision with enemy\n- Moves away from apples\n- No strategic advantage\n\nUP is clearly the better choice. It:\n- Avoids collision risk\n- Moves toward apple at (0, 6)\n- Has a clear path to collect two apples\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: UP to (0, 5)\n2. Next turn: UP to (0, 6) - collect apple!\n3. Continue UP: (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9) - collect another apple!\n4. By then my tail should clear and I can turn right\n\nThe enemy will likely either follow me up (but be behind) or go down toward the right-side apples. Either way, I should be safe and collecting apples.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current situation:\n\n**My position:** Head at (0, 4), against the left wall\n**Enemy position:** Head at (0, 2), also on the left wall, 2 cells below me\n\n**Possible moves from (0, 4):**\n- UP to (0, 5): Safe\n- DOWN to (0, 3): Safe but...\n- LEFT to (-1, 4): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 4): MY BODY! Death!\n\nOnly UP and DOWN are viable.\n\n**Critical collision analysis:**\nThe enemy at (0, 2) can only go UP to (0, 3) or DOWN to (0, 1) (left is off-board, right is their body).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 3) and enemy goes UP to (0, 3) = HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die.\n\n**Strategic choice:**\n- UP to (0, 5) is completely safe from collision\n- From (0, 5), I can continue UP to (0, 6) to grab the apple there!\n- Then continue up toward (0, 9) for another apple\n\n**Path planning:**\nLooking at my body position, if I go UP:\n- This turn: UP to (0, 5)\n- Next turn: UP to (0, 6) - APPLE! \n- Continue: UP to (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9) - another APPLE!\n\nThe left wall creates a \"corridor\" but it's a safe path to collect 2 apples.

One step away!\n- (7, 8) - upper right area\n\n**Possible moves from (0, 5):**\n- UP to (0, 6): Let me check... is this safe? Not my body, not enemy body, not off board. There's an APPLE there! Safe and beneficial!\n- DOWN to (0, 4): That's my body! Death!\n- LEFT to (-1, 5): Off the board! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 5): That's my body at (1, 5)! Death!\n\nSo my ONLY safe move is UP to (0, 6)!\n\nThis is exactly what my previous rationale predicted. I'm going to get the apple at (0, 6).\n\nLet me verify the board:\n```\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . T . . . . . A . .\n 7 . T . . . . . . . .\n 6 A T . . . . . . . .\n 5 1 T . . . . . . . .\n 4 T T . . . . . . . .\n 3 0 . . . . . . . . .\n 2 T T T . . . . . A .\n 1 . T T . . . . . . A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nYes, my head (1) is at (0, 5). My body forms a shape going up column 1 from row 4 to row 8, with (0, 4) also being part of my body.\n\nEnemy head (0) is at (0, 3) with body going down column 0 and then into column 1 and 2.\n\n**What can the enemy do?**\nFrom (0, 3):\n- UP to (0, 4): That's my body! If enemy goes there, enemy dies!\n- DOWN to (0, 2): That's their own body! Death!\n- LEFT to (-1, 3): Off board! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 3): Safe for them\n\nSo the enemy's ONLY safe move is RIGHT to (1, 3)!\n\nThis means I'm safe from collision with the enemy this turn.\n\n**After this turn:**\nIf I go UP to (0, 6), I eat the apple, so my body grows:\n- New head: (0, 6)\n- Body: (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8) - no tail drops because I ate an apple\n\nWait, let me re-count. Current body is 6 segments plus head = 7 total segments. After eating, I'll have 8 total segments.\n\nFrom (0, 6) next turn:\n- UP to (0, 7): Need to check... (1, 7) is my body, but (0, 7) should be free. Safe!\n- DOWN to (0, 5): That'll be my body! Death!\n- LEFT to (-1, 6): Off board! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 6): My body! Death!\n\nSo from (0, 6), only UP to (0, 7) will be safe. Then I can continue up to (0, 8), then (0, 9) to get another apple!\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: UP to (0, 6) - get apple! (Score: 7)\n2. Next turn: UP to (0, 7)\n3. Then: UP to (0, 8)\n4. Then: UP to (0, 9) - get apple! (Score: 8)\n5. After that, turn RIGHT when body clears\n\nThe enemy will have to navigate elsewhere. They can only go RIGHT to (1, 3), and from there they might try to head toward the right-side apples at (8, 2) and (9, 1).\n\nCurrent scores: Me = 6, Enemy = 5. After this turn: Me = 7, Enemy = 5.\n\nThis is going well! My only safe move is also the best strategic move.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current position:\n\n**My position:** Head at (0, 5)\n**Body:** [(0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)]\n\n**Possible moves from (0, 5):**\n- UP to (0, 6): Safe - and there's an APPLE there!\n- DOWN to (0, 4): MY BODY! Death!\n- LEFT to (-1, 5): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 5): MY BODY! Death!\n\nI have only ONE safe move: UP to (0, 6), which conveniently gets me an apple!\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy at (0, 3) can only go:\n- UP to (0, 4): MY BODY - enemy dies if they go here\n- DOWN to (0, 2): THEIR BODY - death\n- LEFT: Off board - death\n- RIGHT to (1, 3): Safe\n\nSo enemy must go RIGHT. No collision risk with me.\n\n**After eating the apple at (0, 6):**\nMy score goes from 6 to 7, extending my lead over the enemy (5 apples).\n\nFrom (0, 6), my next turn options will be:\n- UP to (0, 7): Safe (continue toward apple at (0, 9))\n- Other directions blocked by my body or board edge\n\n**Long-term plan for future me:**\n1. This turn: UP to (0, 6) - apple collected!\n2. Next turn: UP to (0, 7)\n3. Then: UP to (0, 8)\n4. Then: UP to (0, 9) - another apple!\n5. Turn RIGHT when body clears from left wall\n\nThe corridor strategy is working perfectly. I'm collecting apples while the enemy has to take a longer route to the right-side apples.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "<thinking>\nLet me analyze my current situation:\n\n**My position:** Head at (0, 7), Body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7)]\n**Enemy position:** Head at (2, 3), Body: [(1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1)]\n\n**Apple locations:**\n- (9, 1) - bottom right corner\n- (8, 2) - bottom right area\n- (0, 9) - top left corner - very close!\n- (7, 8) - upper right area\n- (3, 5) - middle area\n\n**Possible moves from (0, 7):**\n- UP to (0, 8): Let me check... Looking at my body, I have segments at (1, 7). My tail was at (1, 7) based on the body list. Since I moved and didn't eat an apple, the tail should have dropped. Wait, let me look at current body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7)]. So (1, 7) is still part of my body (the tail). Is (0, 8) free? Looking at the board, (0, 8) appears to be empty. Safe!\n\n- DOWN to (0, 6): That's my body at (0, 6)! Death!\n\n- LEFT to (-1, 7): Off the board! Death!\n\n- RIGHT to (1, 7): That's my tail at (1, 7)! But wait, when I move, my tail will move too... Actually no - my tail only drops if I don't eat an apple. Since I'm moving without eating, the tail at (1, 7) will drop. So when I move RIGHT to (1, 7), that cell would be vacant because my tail just left it. Let me think more carefully...\n\nWhen all snakes move simultaneously:\n1. All heads move to new positions\n2. If a head lands on an apple, the snake grows (tail stays)\n3. If a head doesn't land on an apple, tail drops\n\nSo at the moment of collision check, my body would still include (1, 7) until after the move is processed. Actually, I need to be careful here. The rules say:\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\nSo if I move RIGHT to (1, 7), at the moment my head arrives, is (1, 7) still part of my body? Based on standard Snake rules, the tail moves at the same time as the head, so (1, 7) would be vacated as I move. But to be safe, let me check if this is the actual tail.\n\nMy body is: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7)]\nThe last element (1, 7) is the tail. If I don't eat an apple, the tail drops. So (1, 7) becomes free as I move.\n\nBut wait - the rules say body is ordered head-to-tail. So (0, 6) is right behind my head, and (1, 7) is the tail. If I move to (1, 7), it should be safe because the tail will drop...\n\nActually, I'm not 100% certain how the game handles this. Let me be conservative and assume that moving into my current tail position is dangerous. UP to (0, 8) is definitely safe.\n\nLet me verify by looking at the board:\n```\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A . .\n 7 1 T . . . . . . . .\n 6 T T . . . . . . . .\n 5 T T . A . . . . . .\n 4 T T . . . . . . . .\n 3 T T 0 . . . . . . .\n 2 T T . . . . . . A .\n 1 . T . . . . . . . A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head (1) is at (0, 7). Looking at row 7:\n- (0, 7) is my head (1)\n- (1, 7) is my body (T) - this is my tail\n\nLooking at row 8:\n- (0, 8) appears to be empty (.)\n- (7, 8) has an apple (A)\n\nLooking at row 9:\n- (0, 9) has an apple (A)\n\nSo UP to (0, 8) is definitely safe and gets me closer to the apple at (0, 9).\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy head at (2, 3) with body [(1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1)]\n\nFrom (2, 3), enemy can go:\n- UP to (2, 4): Empty, safe\n- DOWN to (2, 2): Empty, safe\n- LEFT to (1, 3): Their own body! Death!\n- RIGHT to (3, 3): Empty, safe\n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. They'll likely head toward apples. The nearest apples to them are:\n- (3, 5) - UP and RIGHT\n- (8, 2) and (9, 1) - to the RIGHT\n\nEnemy will probably go UP toward (3, 5) or RIGHT toward the right-side apples.\n\n**My plan:**\n1. This turn: UP to (0, 8) - Safe!\n2. Next turn: UP to (0, 9) - Get the apple! (Score: 8)\n3. After that: Turn RIGHT along the top when my body clears\n\nFrom (0, 8):\n- UP to (0, 9): Apple! Should be safe - need to verify body positions\n- DOWN to (0, 7): Will be my body by then\n- LEFT: Off board\n- RIGHT to (1, 8): Need to check if body is there\n\nAfter I move to (0, 8):\n- New head: (0, 8)\n- New body: (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6) - tail at (1, 7) drops\n\nFrom (0, 8) next turn:\n- UP to (0, 9): Apple and safe!\n- DOWN to (0, 7): My body! Death!\n- LEFT: Off board! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 8): Need to check... (1, 6) will be my tail. (1, 8) is not in my body list after this move. So (1, 8) should be free!\n\nSo from (0, 8), I could go UP to get the apple or RIGHT to (1, 8). Getting the apple is better!\n\nCurrent scores: Me = 7, Enemy = 5. I'm maintaining my lead!\n\nMy only clearly safe move this turn is UP to (0, 8).\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current position:\n\n**My position:** Head at (0, 7)\n**Body:** [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7)]\n\n**Possible moves from (0, 7):**\n- UP to (0, 8): Checking the board - this cell is empty! Safe! Gets me closer to apple at (0, 9)!\n- DOWN to (0, 6): MY BODY! Death!\n- LEFT to (-1, 7): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 7): MY TAIL - risky, might count as body collision\n\n**Safe move:** UP to (0, 8) is clearly safe.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy at (2, 3) can go:\n- UP to (2, 4): Safe for them\n- DOWN to (2, 2): Safe for them\n- LEFT to (1, 3): Their body - death\n- RIGHT to (3, 3): Safe for them\n\nEnemy will likely head toward (3, 5) apple or the right-side apples. No collision risk with me.\n\n**Long-term plan for future me:**\n1. This turn: UP to (0, 8)\n2. Next turn: UP to (0, 9) - GET THE APPLE! (Score will be 8)\n3. After eating: Turn RIGHT along top row when body allows\n4. Target (7, 8) apple next, or head toward middle if enemy is far right\n\nI'm on track to collect the apple at (0, 9) next turn! My corridor strategy is working - I've boxed myself in temporarily but have a clear path to the apple. After getting it, I'll have more room to maneuver right along the top.\n\nScore: Me 7, Enemy 5. Maintaining the lead!\n\nUP",

Let me check if it's safe... (0, 9) has an apple. Is there any body there? My body doesn't include (0, 9). Enemy body doesn't include (0, 9). SAFE and gets me an apple!\n\n- DOWN to (0, 7): That's my body at (0, 7)! Death!\n\n- LEFT to (-1, 8): Off the board! Death!\n\n- RIGHT to (1, 8): Let me check... Looking at my body: [(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]. (1, 8) is not in my body. Looking at enemy body: [(2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)]. (1, 8) is not in enemy body. SAFE!\n\nSo I have two safe moves: UP (to get the apple!) and RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy head at (2, 4). From there they can go:\n- UP to (2, 5): Empty, safe\n- DOWN to (2, 3): Their own body! Death!\n- LEFT to (1, 4): That's MY body at (1, 4)! If they move there, they die (they hit my body)\n- RIGHT to (3, 4): Empty, safe\n\nSo enemy will likely go UP toward (3, 5) apple or RIGHT.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP to (0, 9) gets me an apple! This is clearly the best move.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0, 9):\n- My score becomes 8\n- My new head: (0, 9)\n- My body grows: (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6) - tail stays since I ate\n\nFrom (0, 9) next turn:\n- UP to (0, 10): Off board! Death!\n- DOWN to (0, 8): My body! Death!\n- LEFT to (-1, 9): Off board! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 9): Need to check... Is (1, 9) empty? Looking at the board, yes it's empty. Safe!\n\nSo from (0, 9), my only safe move will be RIGHT to (1, 9). This is a bit constraining, but I'm getting an apple!\n\nLet me verify the board state:\n```\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 1 . . . . . . A . .\n 7 T . . . . . . . . .\n 6 T T . . . . . . . .\n 5 T T . A . . . . . .\n 4 T T 0 . . . . . . .\n 3 T T T . . . . . . .\n 2 T T . . . . . . A .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nWait, this board looks different from what I expected. Let me look more carefully...\n\nRow 8: \"1\" at position 0 - that's my head at (0, 8). Correct!\nRow 9: \"A\" at position 0 - that's the apple at (0, 9). Correct!\n\nLooking at the \"T\" markers... There are a lot of T's that seem to span both columns 0 and 1. Let me count:\n- Row 7: T at (0, 7)\n- Row 6: T at (0, 6), T at (1, 6)\n- Row 5: T at (0, 5), T at (1, 5)\n- Row 4: T at (0, 4), T at (1, 4)\n- Row 3: T at (0, 3), T at (1, 3), T at (2, 3)\n- Row 2: T at (0, 2), T at (1, 2)\n- Row 1: (empty at col 0), T at (1, 1)? Wait no, row 1 shows \". . .\" so no T there\n\nHmm, the board seems to show enemy body parts as T as well. Let me re-read:\n\nMy body: [(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]\nEnemy body: [(2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)]\n\nSo the T's include both my body and enemy body mixed together! That explains the pattern.\n\nAnyway, my analysis stands:\n- UP to (0, 9): Safe and gets apple!\n- RIGHT to (1, 8): Safe but no apple\n\nUP is clearly better!\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: UP to (0, 9) - GET THE APPLE! (Score: 8)\n2. Next turn: RIGHT to (1, 9) - only safe option\n3. Continue RIGHT along top row when possible\n4. Head toward (7, 8) apple eventually\n5. Keep avoiding enemy and maintaining lead\n\nCurrent scores: Me 7, Enemy 5. After this turn: Me 8, Enemy 5 (or 6 if they get apple).\n\nI'm going UP to get that apple!\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current position:\n\n**My position:** Head at (0, 8)\n**Body:** [(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]\n\n**Possible moves from (0, 8):**\n- UP to (0, 9): APPLE right there! Checking - this cell has the apple, not any body. SAFE and BENEFICIAL!\n- DOWN to (0, 7): MY BODY! Death!\n- LEFT to (-1, 8): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 8): Empty space, safe but no immediate reward.\n\n**Clear best move:** UP to (0, 9) to collect the apple!\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy at (2, 4) can go:\n- UP to (2, 5): Safe, toward (3, 5) apple\n- DOWN to (2, 3): Their body - death\n- LEFT to (1, 4): MY body - they die\n- RIGHT to (3, 4): Safe\n\nEnemy will likely go UP or RIGHT. No collision risk with me at (0, 9).\n\n**Long-term plan for future me:**\n1. This turn: UP to (0, 9) - GET THE APPLE! (Score becomes 8)\n2. Next turn: From (0, 9), only safe move will be RIGHT to (1, 9) (UP/LEFT are walls, DOWN will be my body)\n3. Continue RIGHT along the top row as body clears\n4. Target (7, 8) apple next - head that direction along row 9 or 8\n5. Keep lead over enemy (currently 8-5 or 8-6 after this turn)\n\nThe apple at (0, 9) is directly above me - this is the perfect moment to grab it!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "<thinking>\nLet me analyze my current situation:\n\n**My position:** Head at (0, 9), Body: [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]\n**Tail:** (1, 6)\n\n**Enemy position:** Head at (3, 4), Body: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2)]\n\n**Apple locations:**\n- (9, 1) - bottom right corner\n- (8, 2) - bottom right area\n- (7, 8) - upper right area\n- (3, 5) - middle area\n- (2, 2) - lower left area\n\n**Possible moves from (0, 9):**\n- UP to (0, 10): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- DOWN to (0, 8): That's my body at (0, 8)! Death!\n- LEFT to (-1, 9): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 9): Let me check... Is (1, 9) safe? My body doesn't have (1, 9). Enemy body doesn't have (1, 9). The board shows row 9 as \"1 . . . . . . . . .\" so (1, 9) is empty. SAFE!\n\nSo I only have ONE safe move: RIGHT to (1, 9).\n\nThis is exactly what I predicted last turn. Let me verify by looking at the board:\n```\n 9 1 . . . . . . . . .\n 8 T . . . . . . A . .\n 7 T . . . . . . . . .\n 6 T T . . . . . . . .\n 5 T T . A . . . . . .\n 4 T T T 0 . . . . . .\n 3 T T T . . . . . . .\n 2 T . A . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nRow 9: \"1\" at position (0, 9) - that's me!\nPosition (1, 9) is \".\" - empty, safe!\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy head at (3, 4). From there they can go:\n- UP to (3, 5): APPLE! They'll probably go here!\n- DOWN to (3, 3): Empty, safe\n- LEFT to (2, 4): Their own body! Death!\n- RIGHT to (4, 4): Empty, safe\n\nEnemy will very likely go UP to (3, 5) to get the apple. That's fine, no conflict with me.\n\n**My only move:** RIGHT to (1, 9)\n\n**Long-term planning from (1, 9):**\nAfter this move, my new position will be:\n- Head: (1, 9)\n- Body: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n- My tail at (1, 6) will move forward since I didn't eat an apple\n\nWait, let me recalculate my body. Current body is [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]. That's 8 segments.\n\nAfter moving to (1, 9) without eating:\n- New head: (1, 9)\n- Body becomes: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n- Tail (1, 6) disappears\n\nSo from (1, 9), my options next turn would be:\n- UP to (1, 10): OFF BOARD! Death!\n- DOWN to (1, 8): Let me check... After this turn, my body at (1, 8)? Let me trace: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]. No (1, 8) in there! Should be safe next turn.\n- LEFT to (0, 9): That will be my body at (0, 9)! Death!\n- RIGHT to (2, 9): Empty based on board. Should be safe.\n\nSo next turn I can go DOWN or RIGHT from (1, 9).\n\n**Targets:**\n- (7, 8) is the closest apple - need to go RIGHT along row 9, then drop down to row 8\n- Path: (1, 9) \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 (3, 9) \u2192 ... \u2192 (7, 9) \u2192 (7, 8) - that's 7 moves to get to (7, 8)\n\nCurrent scores: Me 8, Enemy 5 (will be 6 after they eat the apple at (3, 5))\n\n**Plan:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (1, 9) - only safe move\n2. Next turn: RIGHT to (2, 9) - continue along top row\n3. Continue heading RIGHT toward (7, 8) apple\n4. Keep monitoring enemy position\n\nI must move RIGHT - it's my only option!\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current position:\n\n**My position:** Head at (0, 9) - I'm in the top-left corner!\n**Body:** [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]\n\n**Possible moves from (0, 9):**\n- UP to (0, 10): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- DOWN to (0, 8): MY BODY! Death!\n- LEFT to (-1, 9): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- RIGHT to (1, 9): Empty space - SAFE!\n\nI only have ONE safe move: RIGHT to (1, 9).\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy at (3, 4) will likely move UP to (3, 5) to grab that apple. No collision risk with me.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (1, 9) - only safe move\n2. Next turn from (1, 9): Can go DOWN to (1, 8) or RIGHT to (2, 9)\n3. Target: Head RIGHT along row 9 toward the apple at (7, 8)\n4. Path estimate: (1,9) \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 ... \u2192 (7,9) \u2192 (7,8) to grab that apple\n5. Continue maintaining lead (currently 8-5, will be 8-6 if enemy gets their apple)\n\nMy body is stretched along the left edge in a U-shape, so I need to work my way right to have more maneuvering room and get closer to the remaining apples on the right side of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (3, 5) was eaten by the enemy)\n\n**Enemy position:** Head at (3, 5), Body: [(3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2)]\n\nLet me verify the board:\n```\n 9 T 1 . . . . . A . .\n 8 T . . . . . . A . .\n 7 T . . . . . . . . .\n 6 T . . . . . . . . .\n 5 T T . 0 . . . . . .\n 4 T T T T . . . . . .\n 3 T T T . . . . . . .\n 2 T . A . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nRow 9: \"T 1 . . . . . A . .\" \n- (0, 9) = T (my body)\n- (1, 9) = 1 (my head)\n- (7, 9) = A (apple!)\n\n**Possible moves from (1, 9):**\n- UP to (1, 10): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- DOWN to (1, 8): Let me check my body: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]. No (1, 8) here! Enemy body: [(3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2)]. No (1, 8). The board shows row 8 as \"T . . . . . . A . .\" where T is at (0, 8) and (1, 8) is \".\". SAFE!\n- LEFT to (0, 9): That's my body at (0, 9)! Death!\n- RIGHT to (2, 9): My body doesn't have (2, 9). Enemy body doesn't have (2, 9). Board shows row 9 position (2, 9) as \".\". SAFE!\n\nSo I have TWO safe moves: DOWN to (1, 8) or RIGHT to (2, 9).\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy head at (3, 5). From there they can go:\n- UP to (3, 6): Empty, safe\n- DOWN to (3, 4): Their own body! Death!\n- LEFT to (2, 5): Empty, safe\n- RIGHT to (4, 5): Empty, safe\n\nEnemy will likely go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Most likely they'll head toward apples. The closest apples to them are:\n- (2, 2) - need to go down and left\n- (7, 8) or (7, 9) - need to go right and up\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\nThe apples at (7, 8) and (7, 9) are on my path if I continue going RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 9):\n- Next turn from (2, 9), I can go: RIGHT to (3, 9), DOWN to (2, 8), LEFT to (1, 9) - wait, (1, 9) will be my body next turn. Let me recalculate.\n- After moving to (2, 9), my body becomes: [(1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4)]\n- From (2, 9): UP (off board), DOWN to (2, 8), LEFT to (1, 9) is my body, RIGHT to (3, 9) safe\n- So from (2, 9), I can go DOWN or RIGHT\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 8):\n- After moving to (1, 8), my body becomes: [(1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4)]\n- From (1, 8): UP to (1, 9) is my body, DOWN to (1, 7) - need to check board... row 7 shows \"T . . . . . . . . .\" where T is at (0, 7), (1, 7) is \".\" empty. LEFT to (0, 8) is my body, RIGHT to (2, 8) empty.\n- So from (1, 8), I can go DOWN or RIGHT\n\nBoth options seem roughly equal in terms of immediate safety. Let me think about apple collection:\n\nGoing RIGHT toward (7, 9) apple:\n- Path: (1, 9) \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 (3, 9) \u2192 (4, 9) \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 (7, 9) - 6 moves to apple\n\nGoing DOWN might let me navigate differently, but ultimately I still need to go right for the apples.\n\nActually, wait - I notice there's an apple at (7, 9) in the upper right! If I continue RIGHT, I can reach it faster.\n\nLet me check for potential collisions with the enemy:\n- Enemy at (3, 5) is pretty far from my path along the top row.\n- If enemy goes UP to (3, 6), then maybe (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)... they could intercept me if I'm slow.\n- But I'm already at row 9, so I have a clear path to (7, 9) if I go RIGHT.\n\n**Decision:**\nGoing RIGHT to (2, 9) keeps me on a direct path to the apple at (7, 9). This is 5 more moves away.\n\nGoing DOWN to (1, 8) would delay me and I'd need to go back up or navigate around.\n\nI'll go RIGHT to continue toward the apples at (7, 9) and (7, 8).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (2, 9)\n2. Continue RIGHT along row 9: (3, 9) \u2192 (4, 9) \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 (7, 9) to get the apple!\n3. Then DOWN to (7, 8) for another apple!\n4. Current score: Me 8, Enemy 6. Need to maintain lead and reach more apples.\n</thinking>\n\n**Current Analysis:**\n\nMy head is at (1, 9). Body: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n\n**Possible moves from (1, 9):**\n- UP to (1, 10): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- DOWN to (1, 8): Empty space - SAFE!\n- LEFT to (0, 9): MY BODY! Death!\n- RIGHT to (2, 9): Empty space - SAFE!\n\n**Two safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT**\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- (7, 9) - upper right - 5 moves away if I go RIGHT\n- (7, 8) - near (7, 9) - can grab both in sequence\n- (2, 2) - lower left but enemy is closer\n- (9, 1), (8, 2) - far bottom right\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy head at (3, 5). They can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN would hit their body). They're in the middle area and might compete for apples, but I have a clear path along row 9.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nGoing RIGHT keeps me on a direct path to the apples at (7, 9) and (7, 8). This is the most efficient route to collect multiple apples quickly.\n\nGoing DOWN would delay my progress and potentially complicate my navigation.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (2, 9)\n2. Continue RIGHT: (3, 9) \u2192 (4, 9) \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 (7, 9) to grab apple #9!\n3. Then DOWN to (7, 8) for apple #10!\n4. Maintain apple lead (currently 8-6)\n\nRIGHT",

A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nRow 9: \"T T 1 . . . . A . .\"\n- (0, 9) = T (my body)\n- (1, 9) = T (my body)\n- (2, 9) = 1 (my head)\n- (7, 9) = A (apple!)\n\n**Possible moves from (2, 9):**\n- UP to (2, 10): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- DOWN to (2, 8): Let me check my body: [(1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4)]. No (2, 8) here! Enemy body: [(3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3)]. No (2, 8). SAFE!\n- LEFT to (1, 9): That's my body at (1, 9)! Death!\n- RIGHT to (3, 9): My body doesn't have (3, 9). Enemy body doesn't have (3, 9). Board shows row 9 position (3, 9) as \".\". SAFE!\n\nSo I have TWO safe moves: DOWN to (2, 8) or RIGHT to (3, 9).\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy head at (4, 5). From there they can go:\n- UP to (4, 6): Empty, safe\n- DOWN to (4, 4): Empty, safe\n- LEFT to (3, 5): Their own body! Death!\n- RIGHT to (5, 5): Empty, safe\n\nEnemy will likely go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. They might head toward apples. The closest apples to them are:\n- (2, 2) - need to go down and left\n- (7, 8) or (7, 9) - need to go right and up\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\nThe apples at (7, 9) and (7, 8) are on my path if I continue going RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 9):\n- I continue toward the apple at (7, 9)\n- Path: (3, 9) \u2192 (4, 9) \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 (7, 9) - 4 more moves to apple!\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 8):\n- I move away from (7, 9) but could potentially head down toward (2, 2)\n- But then I'd be moving toward where the enemy might be heading\n\n**Collision risk assessment:**\nIf I continue RIGHT along row 9, the enemy at (4, 5) would need to go up and right to intercept me. Let me calculate:\n- Enemy at (4, 5), if they go UP to (4, 6), then (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)... they could reach (4, 9) in 4 turns\n- I'm at (2, 9), if I go RIGHT: (3, 9), (4, 9)... I could reach (4, 9) in 2 turns\n\nWait, there could be a collision risk if enemy goes UP quickly! Let me think...\n\nActually, enemy at (4, 5) going UP would be (4, 6), then (4, 7), then (4, 8), then (4, 9).\nI'm at (2, 9), going RIGHT: next turn (3, 9), then (4, 9).\n\nSo I'd reach (4, 9) in 2 turns, enemy would reach (4, 9) in 4 turns. No collision there.\n\nBut wait, let me check if enemy might cut across toward (7, 9) apple...\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 5), then (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9)... that's 7 moves.\nI'd reach (7, 9) in 5 moves. I'm faster!\n\n**Decision:**\nGoing RIGHT to (3, 9) keeps me on a direct path to the apple at (7, 9). This is 4 more moves away after this turn.\n\nGoing DOWN to (2, 8) would delay me and put me potentially closer to the enemy's area.\n\nI'll go RIGHT to continue toward the apples at (7, 9) and (7, 8).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (3, 9)\n2. Continue RIGHT along row 9: (4, 9) \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 (7, 9) to get the apple!\n3. Then DOWN to (7, 8) for another apple!\n4. Current score: Me 8, Enemy 6. Need to maintain lead and reach more apples.\n\nLet me double-check my body won't create issues:\nAfter moving to (3, 9), my body becomes: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)]\nThe tail at (1, 4) will move forward, so my snake will be positioned along the left side and top.\n\nFrom (3, 9), next turn I can go:\n- UP: off board\n- DOWN to (3, 8): need to check... my body won't have (3, 8). SAFE\n- LEFT to (2, 9): will be my body! DEATH\n- RIGHT to (4, 9): empty. SAFE\n\nGood, I'll have safe options from (3, 9).\n</thinking>\n\n**Current Analysis:**\n\nMy head is at (2, 9). Body: [(1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4)]\n\n**Possible moves from (2, 9):**\n- UP to (2, 10): OFF THE BOARD! Death!\n- DOWN to (2, 8): Empty space - SAFE!\n- LEFT to (1, 9): MY BODY! Death!\n- RIGHT to (3, 9): Empty space - SAFE!\n\n**Two safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT**\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- (7, 9) - 5 squares away on row 9 - can reach in 5 moves going RIGHT\n- (7, 8) - just below (7, 9) - can grab both in sequence\n- Other apples are far away\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy head at (4, 5). They can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT hits their body). They're 4 rows below me. Even if they head toward (7, 9), I'll get there first (5 moves vs their 7+).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n- If I go RIGHT to (3, 9), enemy can't reach that spot this turn\n- No head-on collision risk\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nGoing RIGHT keeps me on the direct path to (7, 9) apple. I'm ahead 8-6 in apples and should maintain my lead by efficiently collecting the upper-right apples.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (3, 9)\n2. Continue RIGHT: (4, 9) \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 (7, 9) for apple #9!\n3. Then DOWN to (7, 8) for apple #10!\n4. Then assess - maybe head to (8, 2) and (9, 1) area\n\nRIGHT",
