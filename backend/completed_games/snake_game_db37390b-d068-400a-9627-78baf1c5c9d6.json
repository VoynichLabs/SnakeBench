The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (5, 0).\nThe board is 10x10.\n\nAvailable apples are at: (6, 8), (6, 5), (2, 3), (9, 4), (2, 6).\n\nMy goal is to eat apples and survive.\n\n1. **Analyze immediate safe moves:**\nMy head is at (9, 2).\n\n*   **UP**: Moves to (9, 3). This is on the board. Safe.\n*   **DOWN**: Moves to (9, 1). This is on the board. Safe.\n*   **LEFT**: Moves to (8, 2). This is on the board. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT**: Moves to (10, 2). This is off the board (x=10). **Unsafe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n2. **Evaluate safe moves based on proximity to apples:**\n\nThe closest apples are:\n1. (9, 4): Distance |9-9| + |4-2| = 2.\n2. (6, 5): Distance |6-9| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n3. (6, 8): Distance |6-9| + |8-2| = 3 + 6 = 9.\n4. (2, 3): Distance |2-9| + |3-2| = 7 + 1 = 8.\n5. (2, 6): Distance |2-9| + |6-2| = 7 + 4 = 11.\n\nThe target apple (9, 4) is very close.\n\n*   **UP to (9, 3)**: Moves one step closer to (9, 4). Distance 1.\n*   **DOWN to (9, 1)**: Moves one step further from (9, 4). Distance 3.\n*   **LEFT to (8, 2)**: Maintains distance from (9, 4) in terms of Manhattan distance (if measured from (9,2) to (9,4), distance is 2; from (8,2) to (9,4), distance is 1+2=3).\n\nMoving UP seems optimal to reach (9, 4).\n\n3. **Consider enemy snake (Snake #1):**\nSnake #1 is at (5, 0).\nSnake #1's possible moves: (5, 1) UP, (4, 0) LEFT, (6, 0) RIGHT. DOWN (5, -1) is fatal.\nSnake #1 is far from me and far from (9, 4). There is no conflict risk for the next few turns related to the (9, 4) apple.\n\n4. **Select best move:**\nMoving UP to (9, 3) puts me in a direct path to the nearest apple (9, 4).\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP, then UP again to eat the apple at (9, 4). After that, assess whether to go for (6, 5) or (2, 3)/(2, 6). (6, 5) seems next closest and relatively uncontested by Snake #1 starting at (5, 0).\n\nUP",
