I've grown and gained 1 point.\n\nNow, I need to reassess the situation and decide which apple to go for next, keeping an eye on Snake #1's movements. Snake #1 is still at position (7, 8) with body at [(7, 7)], so it's not an immediate threat.\n\nI have a few options: I can go for the apple at (0, 3), which is relatively close, or I can go for the apple at (2, 4), which is also nearby. The apple at (5, 9) is a bit farther away, but it's still a possibility.\n\nConsidering my current position and the layout of the board, I think I'll go for the apple at (2, 4). It's a bit closer to me, and it's not in a direct path with Snake #1.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After getting the apple at (2, 4), I'll reassess the situation and decide which apple to go for next, keeping an eye on Snake #1's movements.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
