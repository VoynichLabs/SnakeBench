Now I need to evaluate which move is best strategically.\n\n**Apple Proximity Analysis:**\n- (0, 5): 3 cells left, 2 cells up\n- (1, 7): 2 cells left, 4 cells up\n- (1, 3): 2 cells left, 0 cells vertical (same row!)\n- (8, 9): 5 cells right, 6 cells up\n- (5, 2): 2 cells right, 1 cell down\n\nThe closest apple is **(1, 3)** which is directly left (2 cells away). This is on my current row, making it very accessible.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n- **LEFT** moves me directly toward the closest apple at (1, 3). This is a strong move because:\n  - It moves me closer to an easily reachable apple\n  - From (2, 3), I can move LEFT again to reach (1, 3) next turn\n  - The enemy is far away at (7, 1), so no collision risk\n  - This keeps my options open for future movement\n\n- **DOWN** moves me to (3, 2), closer to apple at (5, 2), but that apple is further away and requires more moves\n- **UP** moves away from the nearest apple\n- **RIGHT** moves away from the nearest apple\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nFocus on collecting the apple at (1, 3) since it's the closest and most immediately reachable. After that, target (1, 7) which is nearby in the same column, then work toward collecting apples in the lower right area like (5, 2). Avoid the far apple at (8, 9) unless it becomes convenient.\n\nLEFT",

Let me evaluate:\n\n- **UP to (1, 7)**: Eats the apple at (1, 7). This grows my snake and increases my score to 3. Excellent move.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 6)**: Eats the apple at (2, 6). Also grows my snake and increases my score to 3. Excellent move.\n- **DOWN to (1, 5)**: No apple here, just a neutral move.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to apples, which is great! The question is which one is better strategically.\n\n**Considering follow-ups:**\n- If I go UP to (1, 7), my next options from there can reach (2, 6) by going RIGHT, or (8, 9) by going further up/right, or (9, 7) by going right.\n- If I go RIGHT to (2, 6), my next options can reach (1, 7) by going LEFT (after eating (2, 6)), or continue gathering apples.\n\nBoth positions keep me flexible. However, I notice the enemy head is at (5, 6). If the enemy moves LEFT, it would move to (4, 6), which is still far from me. If it moves UP to (5, 7), also far from me.\n\n**Apple Cluster Analysis:**\nThere's a nice cluster at (1, 7), (2, 6) - these are adjacent and close to my current position. I should grab these efficiently.\n\nGoing UP to (1, 7) gets me the first apple and positions me to grab (2, 6) next turn. This seems like a solid sequential strategy.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Turns:**\n- Turn 8: After eating (1, 7), move RIGHT to (2, 6) to eat that apple\n- Turn 9: After eating (2, 6), assess remaining apples: (8, 9), (9, 7), (8, 5)\n- The cluster at (8, 9), (9, 7), (8, 5) is on the right side of the board - plan to navigate there after clearing the left side\n- Keep an eye on enemy at (5, 6); they're currently moving independently but monitor for potential conflicts\n\nUP",

The apple at (4, 7) would be my next target after taking RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 11: Move RIGHT to (3, 6) to approach (4, 7)\n- Turn 12: Move UP to (3, 7) to get adjacent to apple at (4, 7)\n- Turn 13: Move RIGHT to (4, 7) to collect apple #5\n- After that, assess board for next apple cluster (the right side has (8, 9), (9, 7), (8, 5))\n- Keep monitoring enemy snake #0 at (8, 6) - it's moving on the right side of the board, so avoid that area initially\n\nRIGHT",

Moving right to capture (6, 8) is a good path as it's within 2 moves.\n\n**Immediate next moves:**\n- Turn 15: RIGHT to (5, 8) - moving toward (6, 8)\n- Turn 16: RIGHT to (6, 8) - collect apple\n\nRIGHT is the most efficient move to continue my planned approach toward the (6, 8) apple while maintaining distance from the enemy snake.\n\n**Plan note for future turns:**\nContinue moving RIGHT to reach (6, 8) apple on turn 16. After collecting it, reassess enemy position and consider moving toward (6, 9) or (8, 9) depending on safety. Avoid the right edge where enemy is congested.\n\nRIGHT",
