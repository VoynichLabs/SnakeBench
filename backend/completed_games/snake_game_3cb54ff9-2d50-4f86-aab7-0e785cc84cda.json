Taking LEFT to (0,5) avoids this immediate collision risk and maintains a clearer escape route along the left edge, where I can retreat to (0,4) if needed.\n- Overall, LEFT minimizes risk this turn and keeps my snake alive with a straightforward plan to reassess next turn.\n\nPlan for next turns:\n- If the enemy stays near the center, cautiously push toward the right-side apples only if the path remains safe and avoids head-on with the enemy head.\n- If the enemy retreats or becomes distracted, shift focus toward reachable apples while maintaining multiple safe escape options to avoid traps.\n- Avoid tight corridors that could corner me against walls or another snake.\n\nLEFT",

If a safe path opens toward left-side apples (e.g., near (3,4), (2,4), or (4,3)), carefully plan moves to thread through any openings while keeping the tail from becoming trapped.\n\nUP",
