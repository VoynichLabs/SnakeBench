It positions me closer to apples at (2, 4) and (3, 1).\n\t- **RIGHT** is another option to move closer to the apples but poses a slight risk of boxing myself in.\n\n#### **Strategy:**\n\n1. **Avoid Danger:**\n\t- Stay away from walls and other snakes, especially near my top-left.\n\t- Position myself to have multiple route options in the future.\n2. **Move Toward Apples:**\n\t- The apples at (3, 1) and (2, 4) are my best immediate options. Moving **DOWN** sets me up to target (3, 1) next turn.\n\n#### **Next Turn Plan:**\n\n- After moving downward, I\u2019ll analyze whether I can safely move closer to one of the apples, likely (3, 1). I\u2019ll continue to monitor the enemy\u2019s position to avoid direct confrontations.\n\n**Decision: MOVE DOWN.**",

While it\u2019s not in my immediate way, I need to ensure that I don\u2019t get trapped if it moves into my space.\n\n#### **Next Move Decision:**\n\nI\u2019ll **move LEFT** to `(1, 4)`\u2014this keeps me safe, ready to collect the nearest apple, and sets me up to move upward next turn. **Final Move: LEFT.**",

While this move safely distanced our snake from Snake #1's head, it's a bit far from any apple on the current board state.\n\nGiven our extended length and Snake #1's potential diagonal movements, I think it's best to prioritize horizontally reaching the apple at (8,3) rather than pursuing others first. \n\nNext, considering the gap in our snake's initial stretch, it's prudent to span the distance by moving RIGHT, pushing our snake closer to the apple while also increasing the distance from Snake #1.\n\nSo, the next logical move is: RIGHT\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After this RIGHT move, assess the new board position and Snake #1's updated head coordinates if known. Then decide whether to continue RIGHT to reach the apple at (8,3) directly, or potentially switch to a vertical move UP or DOWN if Snake #1's path becomes blocking or we need more options.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

The (8, 3) apple is tantalizingly within reach, and moving RIGHT would bring us directly towards it while maintaining some distance from the rival snake.\n\nHowever, consider the prospect of the enemy's potential counter-move. They could swiftly kill us if we're too entangled or predictable. A part of me thinks we should be more cautious and refrain from rushing straight into their orbit. Perhaps we should veer off slightly to the LEFT to test their early game strategy and see if they'll make a preemptive strike. If they do, we can reassess and adapt.\n\nBut upon further thought, the allure of immediate growth and the value of securing those nearby apples may outweigh the short-term safety concerns. It's our chance to rapidly expand our influence and potentially put pressure on the enemy snake.\n\nSo, with growth and strategic positioning taking priority over immediate security, my next move is: RIGHT. Let's diagonal creep towards (8, 3) and reevaluate next turn based on the enemy's actions.",
