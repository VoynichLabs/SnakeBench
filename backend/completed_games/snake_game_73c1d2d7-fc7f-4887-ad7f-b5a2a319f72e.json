The enemy is moving in their region. If I continue LEFT toward (3, 4), I need to be careful not to collide. The apple at (3, 4) is directly south of the enemy head at (3, 6). This could be a collision risk if we both target the same path.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n- **LEFT to (4, 4)**: Continues direct pursuit of (3, 4). Gets me closer. But I need to watch for enemy head movement - if enemy moves DOWN from (3, 6) toward (3, 4), we could collide.\n- **DOWN to (5, 3)**: Moves toward (1, 3) apple area. Adds distance from (3, 4). Safe but less direct.\n- **UP to (5, 5)**: Moves away from nearby apples. Poor strategic choice.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (3, 6) and I'm at (5, 4), moving LEFT keeps me on track for (3, 4). The enemy would need to move DOWN twice to reach (3, 4), while I need to move LEFT twice. Since we move simultaneously, there's moderate risk, but (3, 4) is still my best target.\n\n**Long-term plan for next 5 turns:**\n1. Continue LEFT to (4, 4) - maintain pressure on (3, 4) apple\n2. Next turn, if path is clear, push to (3, 4) to claim it\n3. After securing (3, 4), reassess enemy position and consider moving toward the (1, 3) cluster\n4. Stay alert for enemy head collisions - monitor their movement pattern\n5. Goal: Tie the score at 3 apples each, then push ahead\n\nLEFT",

Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: (3, 4) → (4, 4) - This is my own body! ❌ ELIMINATED\n\n**Safe moves remaining: DOWN, LEFT**\n\n**Analyzing each safe move:**\n\n**DOWN to (3, 3):**\n- Moves toward the apple at (1, 3) - that's 2 left and 0 down\n- Gets closer to a reachable apple\n- Opens up future moves to reach (1, 3)\n\n**LEFT to (2, 4):**\n- Also moves toward the apple at (1, 3) - that's 1 left and 1 down\n- Gets closer to a reachable apple more directly\n- Could also potentially reach (0, 5) if needed\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nBoth moves are safe. LEFT is slightly more direct toward the (1, 3) apple (distance decreases more efficiently). The enemy head at (2, 5) is close but their body blocks them from moving down easily. Moving LEFT to (2, 4) keeps me safe and positions me well for the next apple.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Turn 12: Move LEFT to (2, 4), positioning closer to apple at (1, 3)\n- Turn 13: Move DOWN to (2, 3), then LEFT to (1, 3) to eat the apple\n- Continue collecting remaining apples while monitoring enemy position\n- Current score is tied 3-3; need to pull ahead\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "I'll analyze the current board state carefully.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- My snake head: (3, 2)\n- My snake body: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2)]\n- My apples: 8\n- Enemy snake #0 head: (9, 8)\n- Enemy apples: 6\n- Available apples: (9, 6), (7, 3), (8, 6), (9, 3), (7, 1)\n\n**Safety Analysis - All four directions from (3, 2):**\n\n1. **UP**: (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n   - This is my neck (my body is at (3, 3)) ❌ COLLISION - Would die\n\n2. **DOWN**: (3, 2) → (3, 1)\n   - This is my body (at (3, 1)) ❌ COLLISION - Would die\n\n3. **LEFT**: (3, 2) → (2, 2)\n   - This is my body (at (2, 2)) ❌ COLLISION - Would die\n\n4. **RIGHT**: (3, 2) → (4, 2)\n   - This is my body (at (4, 2)) ❌ COLLISION - Would die\n\nWait, this is a critical issue. All my immediate moves hit my own body! Let me re-examine the board and my body position.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n- Head at (3, 2)\n- Body: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2)]\n\nFrom (3, 2):\n- UP to (3, 3): Body is there ❌\n- DOWN to (3, 1): Body is there ❌\n- LEFT to (2, 2): Body is there ❌\n- RIGHT to (4, 2): Body is there ❌\n\nThis appears to be a trapped situation. However, let me reconsider - the tail at (1, 2) will move away this turn, potentially freeing up space. But the rules state I cannot move into any part of my body, even if the tail will vacate.\n\nActually, reviewing the body list more carefully: The tail is at (1, 2), and it will move to wherever the head position moves. When I move, the entire snake shifts - the head moves in the chosen direction, and the tail segment disappears from its current position.\n\nSo if I move RIGHT to (4, 2), my body currently occupies (4, 2), but after my move, the tail from (1, 2) will be removed. So there's a timing question - do I collide with current body position or post-movement position?\n\nPer the rules, I check for collisions with the snake's current state before the move, not after. So moving RIGHT would be moving into (4, 2) where my body currently is - that's a collision.\n\nThis is genuinely a trapped state. I'm surrounded by my own body. Let me see if I made an error... Actually, looking at positions again, all four adjacent cells contain my body segments. This shouldn't be possible unless I miscounted.\n\nLet me recount from the board visualization:\n- (3,2) = 1 (my head)\n- (3,3) = T (my body, directly above)\n- (4,2) = T (my body, directly right)\n- (2,2) = T (my body, directly left)\n- (3,1) = T (my body, directly below)\n\nThis is a death trap. Given the rules state \"you cannot choose a move that obviously kills you,\" and all moves kill me, I should choose the move that gives the best chance if there's any possibility I'm misreading the board.\n\nThe most likely scenario for escape would be UP, hoping I miscounted the body positions.\n\nUP",
