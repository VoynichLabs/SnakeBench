It jumps toward the center, threatens a future squeeze, and keeps more future joking room than sticking to the wall right now.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (for the next few turns):\n- Press toward the center with measured moves, avoiding any direct head-on crash unless I have a clear advantage.\n- Use edges and short-term space denial to force the opponent into suboptimal lines.\n- If he glances toward the center, pivot to a trapping corridor and aim for a simultaneous collision only if it guarantees survival and growth.\n\nMOVE PLAN NOTES:\n- Right now, RIGHT is my best bet to start closing distance and keep multiple safe follow-ups. It also avoids a hard, long wall trap that could give the opponent room to maneuver around me.\n- I will monitor his choices next turn closely; if he veers into a predictable path, I\u2019ll pivot to a safer sequence that triples my chances of creating a head-on or cutting him off.\n\nRIGHT",
