However, I'll avoid heading too far down the board to ensure I don't risk running into them later.\n3. **Future Moves**: After collecting the apple at (7, 2), I may want to explore moves that keep me central on the board, allowing me to access more apples in multiple directions. I'll try to corral the enemy snake, if possible, by controlling key parts of the board.\n\nWith this in mind, my next move will be to move **RIGHT** to position myself at (2, 3) and grab the apple.\n\nDecided Next Move: RIGHT.",

Now, I'm at the center of the board, which gives me more flexibility to grab apples in any direction. The enemy snake at (5, 4) with body at (5, 5) is close, but not directly threatening yet. The other apples are positioned at (9, 0), (7, 8), (1, 4), and (0, 4).\n\nKey considerations:\n\n1. The apple at (9, 0) is tempting since it's unprotected and directly in front of me. However, making a beeline for it might expose me to the enemy snake if they plan a move toward me.\n2. The apple at (7, 8) is also in a relatively safe position diagonally up and right, but it's further out.\n3. The apple at (1, 4) is closer to the enemy, so grabbing that might put me in a riskier spot.\n4.

The apple at (9, 0) is still blocked by the enemy snake at (8, 4), so it remains out of reach for now. The enemy snake at (6, 5) is still a threat, and they seem to be angled toward the center, making the area around the apple at (7, 2) potentially dangerous.\n\nThe central apple at (1, 4) is still a viable choice, but it might be too predictable. If I grab it, I could paint a target on my back for the enemy at (6, 5), and it might also expose me to attacks from other directions. On the other hand, moving UP would keep me aligned with the (9, 0) apple's general position, allowing me to pivot toward it later if the enemy moves away. It also creates a slight buffer against the snake at (6, 5), as they\u2019d need to make a risky lateral move to challenge me directly.\n\nGiven these considerations, my best move is UP.
