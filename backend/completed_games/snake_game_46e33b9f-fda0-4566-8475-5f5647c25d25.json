It keeps us along the top edge and moves us toward those juicy apples at (4, 9), (6, 9), and (8, 9). \ud83d\udc0d\n- **DOWN**: (0, 8). Also safe! It puts us closer to the middle-left apple at (0, 7). \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThe rival is way down south. If I go RIGHT, I'm securing the high ground. If I go DOWN, I'm heading straight for him to start the squeeze. Since we both have 0 apples, a head-on collision right now is a DRAW, and we don't play for draws, we play for the DUB! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nStrategy: I'm going to start moving RIGHT to control the top wall. We're going to grab those top-row apples, get some length, and then we're going to dive down like a hawk to wrap him up. He's at (1, 2), he's got a lot of space, but not for long! Let's get that content!\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nInitial spawn. Moving Right to take control of the top edge and position for the (4, 9) apple.

By the time we hit the right wall at (9, 9), we\u2019ll have a tail, we\u2019ll have the length, and we\u2019ll be ready to pivot DOWN and cut them off. It\u2019s called the **\"Iron Ceiling\"** strat\u2014we own the top, then we crush them against the floor! \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5\n\nThey have 1 apple, we have 0. Does that scare us? NO! Because once we snag (4, 9) and the rest, we\u2019ll be the ones with the reach. If they try to meet us in a head-on collision later, we\u2019ll make sure we have more segments so they\u2019re the ones who \"crash out\"! \ud83d\ude24\n\nKeep the momentum! We are going for that top-row sweep! Let's get this bread! \ud83e\udd56\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Continue moving RIGHT along the Y=9 line to collect (4, 9), (6, 9), and (8, 9). This builds our length while maintaining maximum distance from the enemy until we are big enough to initiate a \"Search and Destroy\" mission. Control the perimeter, then collapse the pocket!\n\nRIGHT",

Once we have the length, we're going to pivot down and trap them in the corner like a dusty old trophy! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**THE LONG-TERM VISION:**\nGrab (4, 9) this turn.

If Snake #1 tries to come up for air, they\u2019ll run straight into our massive body! We are playing the long game, chat!

But why go down when there's an apple literally right in front of us? We\u2019re for the gains, not the retreats! \ud83d\udcc9\n- **LEFT**: (4, 9). That's our own body, chat! Moving backwards is a rookie mistake and WE ARE PROS! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 9). **VICTORY SECURED!** Look at the map! There is an apple sitting right there at (6, 9). It\u2019s free real estate! \ud83c\udfe0\ud83c\udf4f\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nSnake #1 is at (5, 1). If they move UP, they are still 8 units away from our neck. They are currently irrelevant! We are going to snag (6, 9), get that +1, and keep moving towards the corner apples at (8, 9) and (9, 9). \n\nBy staying high, we are building a massive \"L-shape\" that will eventually let us swing down like a guillotine! \u2694\ufe0f Once we get to (9, 9), we can scan the board and decide if we want to loop back or continue the perimeter sweep. We have the length, we have the position, and we have the CHAT! \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's grab that apple and extend the lead! HE'S NOT READY FOR THE NORTHERN AGGRESSION! \ud83e\uddca\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

From there you can pivot to pressure the center and potentially force a favorable head-on or trap if the rival missteps.\n- Stay aware of the rival\u2019s head at (5,9); avoid predictable lineups that let them slip into your planned corridor.

DOWN to (6,0) is safe but boring and doesn\u2019t threaten growth.\n- UP to (6,2) eats the apple at (6,2) now, boosting your score and unlocking a vertical apple train on the central file (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) which all exist in the current apple list.\n- RIGHT to (7,1) is safe but yields no immediate growth and delays the central threat-building.\n\nPlan if you go UP now:\n- Turn 6: Move UP to (6,2) and eat the apple. Score tied with opponent (both at 2 apples soon). Your head will be at (6,2); body becomes (6,2)-(6,1)-(5,1).\n- Turn 7: If the path remains clear, move UP to (6,3) to eat the apple at (6,3).

You\u2019ll be even longer: (6,4)-(6,3)-(6,2)-(6,1)-(5,1).\n- With this vertical pillar, you gain multiple safe follow-ups and can pivot right later to chase other apples (e.g., toward (9,6) or (9,3)) while keeping the rival boxed in toward the top.\n\nSafety and pressure notes:\n- Opponent is far at (6,9); a quick drop straight down is unlikely to collide on this turn and your vertical stack gives you room to maneuver.\n- Don\u2019t loop back into your own body; keep the tail reference at (5,1) in mind as you extend upward.\n- Keep an eye on the board edges to avoid accidental self-cutoffs as you grow.\n\nCurrent scoreboard context:\n- Your apples: 1 (soon to be more after the UP chain)\n- Opponent apples: 2\n- The goal is to swing the pace with aggressive growth while preserving safety and future options.\n\nLong-term positioning:\n- After stabilizing on (6,4), pivot to the right to press toward the right-side apples (e.g., (9,3), (9,6)) and threaten a head-on if the rival dares to chase downward.\n- Maintain multiple escape routes from the vertical pillar to avoid trapping yourself as you extend.\n\nTURN 6 DECISION: UP",

Eating it boosts your score to 3 vs the opponent\u2019s 2, giving you the lead and pressure.\n- Strategic pillar: after eating, you create a vertical chain (6,3)-(6,2)-(6,1) that gives you multiple safe follow-ups on the next turns and sets up future pivot options toward (6,4) and then toward the right-side apples (9,3) or (9,6).\n- Board control: with the opponent stuck up near y=9, building a tall column on the central file helps you box space and keep escape routes open while you grow.\n\nSafety and future plan:\n- Don\u2019t loop into your own body; keep in mind your tail currently sits at (5,1). As you extend upward, you\u2019ll have room to maneuver and pivot.\n- After grabbing (6,3), consider continuing UP to (6,4) on Turn 8 to grab (6,4) and push your length further. Then pivot RIGHT to chase the right-side apples (9,3) and (9,6) while keeping options to dodge any sudden chases from the opponent.\n- Stay aggressive but patient: you want to force mistakes or a head-on collision only if you can secure the advantage.\n\nTURN 7 DECISION: UP\nUP",

LET\u2019S BREAK IT DOWN, LIVE-STREAM STYLE \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nReasoning and plan for this turn:\n- Current head: (6,4). We\u2019re facing three SAFE directional options: UP to (6,5), LEFT to (5,4), RIGHT to (7,4). DOWN is illegal (that would bite our own neck).\n- Safety check: None of UP/LEFT/RIGHT run into the opponent\u2019s body right now (opponent is at (9,9) with body (8,9)-(6,9)). So we\u2019re free to pick among those three without an immediate death.\n- Strategic aim: We\u2019re up 4 apples to 3, so we should be aggressive and try to box the rival in while expanding our own footprint. The most meat-on-the-bones move is to start extending a vertical pillar on x=6 by going UP, creating a growing barrier that can constrain the top-right space and set up future chops at the enemy\u2019s path.\n- Risk assessment: If we go LEFT or RIGHT, we could chase a quick apple or threaten a head-on, but we\u2019d scatter our pillar progress and potentially give the opponent more room to maneuver near the top edge. Sticking to UP builds a long-term control line without closing off our own space immediately.\n- Focus: We\u2019re not chasing apples this turn; we\u2019re prioritizing board control and delayed growth via a pillar, which aligns with our \u201cdominate the board\u201d mentality.\n\nShort-term plan note for the next moves:\n- Build a vertical line up the column x=6 (heads toward y=9 after a few steps). This helps trap open lanes, keeps escape routes tight for the opponent, and sets up potential head-on if the timing aligns with the rival\u2019s moves. Stay mindful of not cutting off our own tail too soon.\n\nYour move (for this turn): UP\n\nUP",

We\u2019ll avoid any move that traps us against our own body or sends us into a corner we can\u2019t exit from.\n\nApples are a non-priority this turn; our objective is board dominance and a potential head-on advantage later if the opportunity presents itself.\n\nMOVE PLAN (brief): Build the barrier upward on x=6, maintain multiple escape options, and force him into restricted space near the top-right.\n\nUP",

DOWN IS OFF THE TABLE (YOU\u2019D BITE YOUR OWN TAIL INTO (6,5)). RIGHT BREAKS THE BAR, LEFT KEEPS IT BUT DOESN'T PUSH THE PRESSURE. SO: UP BRINGS A SOLID VERTICAL PILLAR ON X=6, CLOSING OFF THE TOP-RIGHT PATHS AND SETTING UP A LATE-ROUND BOX-OUT.\n\nDECISION SUMMARY\n- Safe options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN = DEAD (collide with our own body).\n- Why UP: Extends the vertical barrier to (6,7), creating a wall from (6,7) down to (6,3) over time as we march. It *shrinks* the opponent\u2019s escape routes toward the top-right quadrant and aligns with our current lead (4 apples vs 3). It also preserves multiple safe follow-ups and keeps us away from hard dead-ends.\n- Why LEFT isn\u2019t as strong: It keeps the barrier but doesn\u2019t push it forward; gives him more room to maneuver on the right side.\n- Why RIGHT isn\u2019t safe: It breaks the barrier and surrenders control of the top corridor.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Push UP to extend the barrier along x=6.\n- Monitor opponent head (9,7); if he tries to swing left through the top gap, adapt with a quick pivot to keep the line intact and threaten a tighter enclosure.\n- Don\u2019t chase apples aggressively this turn; prioritize board control to set up a potential head-on or a corner squeeze later.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE\n- The goal is a steady box-in on the top-right, using the growing x=6 wall to trap him into a shrinking arena. If a direct head-on opportunity emerges with a return to safety, take it; otherwise, keep advancing the barrier and force him into restricted space.\n\nMOVE PLAN (FOCUS)\n- UP\n- Maintain awareness of enemy head and your own body.\n- If he commits to left around (8,7) or (7,7), be ready to pivot but keep the pillar intact.\n\nUP",

Our rival is sitting at a score of 5, and we are right on his heels with 4! But look at the map\u2014who has the real power? WE DO!\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CHECK:**\n- **SNAKE #1 (THE ARCHRIVAL)**: Head at (7, 7). His body is trailing behind him at (6, 7)-(6, 3). He\u2019s looking a bit cramped in that mid-left sector, isn't he? \n- **US (ID 0)**: Head at (9, 5). Body segments at (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9). We are a vertical wall of doom!\n\n**EVALUATING THE MOVES (NO THROWS ALLOWED!):**\n- **UP**: (9, 6). NOPE! That's our own body. We aren't trying to be a donut! \ud83c\udf69\u274c\n- **RIGHT**: (10, 5). WALL. We aren't ready to exit the stream yet! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT**: (8, 5). This is an interesting pivot. It moves us toward the center, but why give up our wall advantage?\n- **DOWN**: (9, 4). CHAT, THIS IS THE PLAY! Look at (9, 3), (9, 1), and (9, 0). There is a literal trail of snacks waiting for us! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf5f\n\n**THE ALPHA STRATEGY:**\nOur rival is at (7, 7). If he wants to stop us, he has to travel across the board. By moving **DOWN**, we are doing two things:\n1. **SCORING**: We are lining up a triple-kill on those apples at (9, 3), (9, 1), and (9, 0). We will skyrocket to 7 points! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **BOXING**: By staying on the (9, y) line, we keep our body as a long barrier. If he tries to come East, he\u2019s going to run into a 10-segment long wall of US. \ud83d\udea7\n\nHe has the lead by 1 apple, but he\u2019s playing a dangerous game in the middle. We are playing the perimeter, scaling up, and preparing to wrap around the bottom to trap him in the \"West Wing\"! Let's secure the bag and the win! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are continuing the \"Southbound Express\" strategy. We hit (9, 4) this turn, then (9, 3) for the apple. We keep descending to (9, 0). Once we hit the bottom-right corner, we'll pivot LEFT along the South wall to collect (5, 0) and (3, 0). We are going to be so long that the rival won't have anywhere left to breathe! STAY TUNED!\n\nDOWN",

Safe moves this turn are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. LEFT would smack into your own body, so that\u2019s a no-go.\n\nMY TAKE: I\u2019m picking DOWN to set up the easy apple at (8,6) next turn and pin the right edge tight. It keeps my lead (5 apples vs 4) while forcing him to react along the right corridor. If he tries to slip left to contest (8,5) or drops down, I can pivot to keep him boxed in and look for the head-on window when the timing\u2019s right.\n\nPLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:\n- Turn 13: go to (7,6) (DOWN) to line up the apple at (8,6).\n- Turn 14: if the apple is open, move RIGHT to (8,6) and eat to grow.\n- Use the right edge to constrain his options; avoid risky direct head-on unless I can force a guaranteed collision.\n- Watch his moves carefully: if he steps toward (8,5), I\u2019ll adjust to keep the squeeze and prevent a wraparound escape.\n\nMOVE\nDOWN\n\nRIGHT",

Our head is at (8,6); he\u2019s parked on the right edge around (9,3) with a vertical spine. We\u2019ve got two safe moves: DOWN to (8,5) or LEFT to (7,6). UP is a suicide dive into our own neck, and RIGHT would smash into Snake #0\u2019s body on (9,6). No risks, just ruthless chess.\n\nDECISION: We\u2019re going DOWN to (8,5). It keeps us tight on the enemy\u2019s right flank and preserves future box-tight pressure without inviting a head-on crash right now.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Turn 15: Move DOWN to (8,5). Pick the path that keeps us on the right edge and preserves chase options.\n- Turn 16+: Hunker along Snake #0\u2019s outer boundary on the right, pressuring his escape routes, and force mistakes or a misstep toward our trap.\n- If he tries to slip left (toward (8,3) or (7,3) later), adapt quickly and maintain the squeeze while watching for safe follow-ups.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY:\n- Maintain score pressure (6 apples vs 5) by staying aggressive but surgical with space.\n- Use the wall on the right to corral him, aiming for a favorable head-on if the timing lines up or simply suffocate his options until he slips into collision risk.\n- Stay unpredictable; mix in patient chases and quick pivots to avoid giving him clean escapes.\n\nLET\u2019S GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

He\u2019s got 6 apples to our 5, but we\u2019re about to turn the tide. He\u2019s boxed in by his own tail (8, 7) and our massive body (9, 5-7). Time to squeeze!\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\n- **US (ID 0)**: Head at (9, 2). Body: (9, 3-7). We are a vertical wall of doom!\n- **SNAKE #1**: Head at (8, 5). Body: (8, 6-7), (7, 7), (6, 7-5).

He's struggling for space while we are expanding our territory down the edge. \n3. **SETUP**: After we grab (9, 1), we have (9, 0) right underneath us for turn 17. That's a back-to-back feast! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are executing the \"Right-Hook Harvest.\" Move DOWN to (9, 1) this turn. Next turn, grab (9, 0) to take the lead 7-6! After that, we pivot LEFT to grab (8, 1) and (5, 1). Snake #1 is stuck in a self-inflicted maze at (8, 5). If he tries to come down to contest our apples, he has to pass through (8, 2) or (8, 1), where we can potentially force a head-on collision since we\u2019ll have the score advantage soon!

Snake #1 is currently trapped in the middle-right; if he tries to dive for these bottom apples, we\u2019ll be there waiting with a score advantage to force the head-on collision! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are going DOWN to (9, 0) to take the lead 7-6. After that, we are going to pivot LEFT along the 0-row. We've got a buffet waiting for us: (5, 0), (3, 0), (1, 0). We are basically building a wall across the bottom of the map. If Snake #1 tries to come down to (8, 1) or (5, 1), we are going to be in an incredible position to box him against the edges. WE ARE GOING FOR THE SWEEP, CHAT! DON'T BLINK!\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 is sitting at 6, looking absolutely lost in the sauce at (8, 3)!\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CHECK:**\n- **US (ID 0)**: Head at (9, 0). Body stretching up the 9-column to (9, 7). \n- **SNAKE #1**: Head at (8, 3). Body: (8, 4-7), (7, 7), (6, 7). \n- **THE RADIUS**: He's currently one tile to our left and three tiles up. He\u2019s trying to navigate that middle-right zone, but look at us\u2014we are the Great Wall of the East!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP**: (9, 1). **FATAL!** That\u2019s our own body! We don't do back-to-back mistakes for the highlights! \u274c\n- **RIGHT**: (10, 0). **WALL!** We ain't glitching out of bounds today! \u274c\n- **DOWN**: (9, -1). **WALL!** Floor is lava, literally! \u274c\n- **LEFT**: (8, 0). **THE ONLY PLAY!** And it's a BEAUTIFUL one! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**WHY LEFT IS THE ABSOLUTE PLAY:**\n1. **SURVIVAL**: It\u2019s literally the only legal move, but guess what? It\u2019s exactly where we want to be! \n2. **THE BUFFET**: Look at the 0-row, chat! (5, 0), (3, 0), (1, 0). It\u2019s a straight line of gains! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n3. **AGGRESSION**: By moving to (8, 0), we are cutting off the entire bottom-right corner. If Snake #1 tries to dive down to grab apples at (5, 1) or (3, 0), he has to deal with US. We have the higher score! If we meet head-to-head at (8, 0) or (7, 0), WE WIN THE GAME RIGHT THERE! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe are sweeping the bottom row, fam! From (8, 0), we're heading straight for (5, 0). We\u2019re going to stay low, keep our body hugging the bottom wall to maximize space, and wait for Snake #1 to make a desperate move.

Let\u2019s move like a hawk but think like a chess player.\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udee1\n\nSITUATION SNAPSHOT\n- YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1) Head: (8,3) | Body: [(8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7)]\n- OPPONENT SNAKE #0 Head: (9,0) | Body: [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)]\n- APPLE SPREAD includes (8,1) and a bunch of others, but we\u2019re not chasing apples in the abstract\u2014we\u2019re chasing the box and control.\n\nSAFETY CHECK: WHAT CAN WE ACTUALLY DO THIS TURN?\n- UP = (8,4) is right on our neck (our own body). DEAD.\n- RIGHT = (9,3) is Snake #0\u2019s body. DEAD.\n- DOWN = (8,2) SAFE.\n- LEFT = (7,3) SAFE.\n\nOPTIONS WE CARE ABOUT\n- DOWN to (8,2): keeps us in the right-side apple corridor, lines up to grab (8,1) next turn, and maintains edge leverage. Also keeps the chase path open without letting Snake #0 slip behind us along the middle.\n- LEFT to (7,3): swings us into a bit more middle space, could invite a longer chase arc, but still safe for this turn. Might give him a cleaner path to pressure our tail later if he forks.\n\nWHY I\u2019M PICKING DOWN (8,2) THIS TURN\n- It anchors us on the apple corridor, so we can threaten (8,1) next turn and pull the score closer.\n- It keeps us aligned with the right edge, making it harder for Snake #0 to box us in immediately.\n- It\u2019s a safer, more controllable move given his likely reply (most plausible: he moves LEFT to (8,0) to start setting up a bottom-row pressure while we advance downward).\n\nPOTENTIAL REACTIONS AND FOLLOW-UPS\n- If Snake #0 goes LEFT to (8,0): we\u2019ll still have a vertical line from (8,2) upward to our existing body; we can threaten to drop to (8,1) to eat the apple and extend our tail with a tight chase\u2014pressure keeps building without collapsing us.\n- If Snake #0 tries a different route later, staying on (8,2) gives us multiple safe follow-ups (down toward more apples, or left to redirect) while avoiding immediate traps.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS\n- Climb the apple corridor safely, keep Snake #0 on the edge, and push for an equal or favorable head-on when we\u2019re in a better apples-to-risk ratio.\n- Maintain space to dodge his next engagement; avoid tight corners that could trap us against the edge with his head coming in from the side.\n- Stay aggressive but not reckless\u2014score race is tight; turning the corner to grab a key apple while keeping him boxed is the path to victory.\n\nFINAL MOVE (CHOSEN): DOWN\n\nDOWN",

HE IS SCARED! \ud83d\ude31\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CHECK:**\n- **US (ID 0)**: Head at (8, 0). Body stretching back through (9, 0) and up the 9-column to (9, 6).\n- **SNAKE #1**: Head at (8, 2).

Since we have more apples (7 vs 6), we WIN the tie-break! \ud83e\udd4a\n- **LEFT**: (7, 0). **SAFE & STRATEGIC!** This continues our sweep of the bottom row apples (5, 0), (3, 0), and (1, 0). \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nDo we go for the kill or the gains? Chat, we are here for the LONG HAUL and the total DOMINATION. If we move **LEFT**, we keep our lead, grab the fruit, and extend our body even further to wrap around the entire map.

Once we reach the corner, we pivot UP the 0-column. We are essentially circling the entire board to trap him in a shrinking cage. He\u2019s playing checkers, we\u2019re playing 4D Snake Chess!

We\u2019re eyeing the box and edge control like a hawk, trying to edge him into a bad spot without feeding him an easy apple fight. \ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udee1\n\nDECISION SUMMARY\n- SAFE MOVES: DOWN to (8,1) (eat apple) or LEFT to (7,2) (safe, no immediate contact).\n- DEADLY OPTIONS: UP to (8,3) would slam into our own neck; RIGHT to (9,2) would crash into Snake #0\u2019s body.\n- RISK CONSIDERATIONS: DOWN could trigger contested apples if Snake #0 also aims for (8,1) this turn, potentially a head-on that could favor the higher-apple opponent. LEFT keeps us on the right edge, preserves escape lanes, and avoids giving him an easy closing move this turn.\n\nCHOSEN STRATEGY (WHY LEFT)\n- LEFT keeps us safe right now, preserves multiple follow-ups, and blocks a quick edge-enclosure from Snake #0.\n- It also invites a longer chase pattern where we can pressure his tail while slowly tightening the orbit around the right side.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Stay LEFT this turn to (7,2) and avoid a contested apple clash.\n- On the next couple of turns, hover along the right-middle corridor to keep the opponent pinned toward the bottom or left edge while we gather safe apples.\n- Avoid tight corners and rifts that could let him slip past our tail. Look for a moment to force a head-on when our apple count aligns or we can trap him between walls and our body.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE TO SELF\n- If we swing the score advantage or create a boxed chase, pivot to a controlled head-on when beneficial. The goal is to turn his chase into a trap while we maintain safe growth.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS\n- Bait and box: keep him near the border, push him toward the bottom, and try to draw him into a synchronized corner where a well-timed move could KO him or at least force a suboptimal re-route.\n- Stay adaptable: if he commits to bottom pressure, shift to create a widening gap to grab safe apples and extend our length without exposing the head.\n\nCHOSEN MOVE: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

We are successfully building the Great Wall of the South! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\n- **US (ID 0)**: Head at (7, 0). Body: (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5). \n- **SNAKE #1**: Head at (7, 2). Body: (8, 2) through (8, 7). \n- **THE VIBE**: He is literally two blocks above us. If he tries to come down, he\u2019s hitting our massive body trail. If he tries to move towards the bottom row, he's begging for a head-on collision. AND REMEMBER CHAT: We have 7 apples, he has 6. If we clash heads, HE LOSES, WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **RIGHT**: (8, 0). **FATAL!** That\u2019s our own neck, chat. We aren't throwing for the highlights! \u274c\n- **DOWN**: (7, -1). **WALL!** No shot we're dying to the boundary. \u274c\n- **UP**: (7, 1). **ULTRA AGGRESSIVE!** This moves us closer to him. If he moves DOWN, we collide at (7, 1). Since we have the score lead, we win the tie-break! But it's risky if he moves LEFT.\n- **LEFT**: (6, 0). **BIG BRAIN PLAYS!** We continue our march towards the apples at (5, 0), (3, 0), and (1, 0). By staying on the bottom edge, we are keeping our entire body as a shield. He can't get under us, and we are cutting off the entire bottom half of the map! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWhy fight him now when we can starve him? Snake #1 is cramped in those right-side columns. By moving **LEFT**, we secure the (5, 0) apple next turn. We are expanding our lead (8 vs 6) and making it impossible for him to contest the bottom-left quadrant. We are playing the long game, chat! We're going to loop around the left side and pin him against his own tail or the top wall! He's literally playing in a phone booth while we own the arena! \ud83c\udfdf\ufe0f\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep grinding LEFT along the y=0 line. Grab (5, 0), (3, 0), and (1, 0). Once we hit (0, 0), we pivot UP to cage him in. If he tries to dive into our lane, we force the head-on collision because we have the higher score! EZ CLAP! \ud83d\udc4f\n\nLEFT",

We just grabbed that apple at (5, 0) and we are sitting pretty with 8 points! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 Snake #1 is looking absolutely LOST in the sauce at (5, 2). He's trying to find a way out, but we are the gatekeepers of the South! \n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\n- **US (ID 0)**: Head at (5, 0). Body stretching back through (6, 0) all the way to (9, 4). We are a solid wall of muscle! \ud83d\udc0d\n- **SNAKE #1**: Head at (5, 2). Body: (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5). He\u2019s hovering right above us, and he\u2019s starting to realize he's running out of room!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 0). **FATAL ERROR!** That's our own body. We don't clip through ourselves for the highlights, that's just embarrassing! \u274c\n- **DOWN**: (5, -1). **OUT OF BOUNDS!** I\u2019m not trying to fall off the face of the earth today, chat! \u274c\n- **UP**: (5, 1). **THE BAIT!** There is an apple at (5, 1). If we move UP, we take it. But wait\u2014if Snake #1 moves DOWN to (5, 1) at the same time, we have a head-on collision. Since we have 8 apples and he has 6, **WE WOULD WIN THE GAME RIGHT THERE!** \ud83e\udd4a \ud83c\udfc6 It's a \"win-win\" move, but let's see if there's a more dominant path.\n- **LEFT**: (4, 0). **THE SNIPER PLAY!** This keeps us safe, moves us toward the apples at (3, 0) and (1, 0), and keeps the pressure on the bottom lane.\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nChat, we are in his head! If we go UP to (5, 1), we either get a point or we end him. But if we go LEFT to (4, 0), we continue our \"Anconda Squeeze.\" Look at the map: there's a juicy cluster of apples on the left side (3, 0), (1, 0), (3, 2). By staying on the y=0 line, we own the entire bottom half of the board. He's forced to stay high where it's crowded! We are going to keep our lead, stay alive, and let him starve or crash into his own tail! We're playing for the long-term dub!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're taking the \"Low Road\" strategy. We move LEFT to (4, 0), then scoop (3, 0), then (1, 0). We stay one step ahead of him at all times. If he tries to dive into our territory, we use our score advantage to force the collision. He's playing checkers, we're playing 4D Snake! \ud83e\udde0 Let's go get that 9th apple and keep this win streak alive!\n\nLEFT",

The goal is to pin him in and force the bite, not chase every apple.\n\nSafety checks for the 4 moves:\n- UP to (5,3): Safe (not hitting own body, not colliding with opponent).\n- DOWN to (5,1): Safe (apple there, would grow); but it\u2019s a potential head-on risk if he also runs up to (5,1) this turn.\n- LEFT to (4,2): Safe (on the left flank, not touching bodies).\n- RIGHT to (6,2): Dead\u2014bumps into your own neck (illegal).\n\nDECISION: LEFT\n\nREASONING:\n- It keeps you on the left flank, pressuring Snake #0 from the side and nudging him toward walls for a future trap.\n- It preserves multiple escape lanes and reduces the risk of a nasty head-on this turn.\n- It aligns with the long-term plan to squeeze him toward the bottom-left cluster where his options shrink.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Maintain the left-leaning corridor and tighten the space between you and the wall in a controlled zig-zag, edging him closer to cornering by the bottom/left.\n- Grow selectively only when it doesn\u2019t blow the box; avoid giving him a clean cross-path.\n- Watch the apple at (3,2) and (3,0) as potential detours that could either help you or give him space\u2014use them as bait if safe.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (just a heads-up for the next turns):\n- Build a tight right-angled enclosure around Snake #0 by alternating edge-hugging moves, driving him into a dead-end or a head-on collision.\n- Keep your options open: don\u2019t over-commit into a single narrow lane; keep at least two safe exits until he\u2019s boxed.\n- If he overextends into your line and the apple bank allows, consider a calculated growth to maintain the box without sacrificing safety.\n\nNow we lock it in: LEFT",

We are playing chess while he's playing with crayons! \ud83d\udd8d\ufe0f\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\n- **US (ID 0)**: Head at (4, 0). Our body is a total blockade from (5, 0) all the way to (9, 3). We have massive control over the bottom right, and we're moving into the bottom left!\n- **SNAKE #1**: Head at (4, 2). His body is trailing behind him at (5, 2), (6, 2), etc. He\u2019s parallel to us but trapped in the middle of the board.\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **RIGHT**: (5, 0). **ABSOLUTELY NOT!** That\u2019s our own neck, chat! We aren't trying to ends the stream early with a self-clamping fail! \u274c\n- **DOWN**: (4, -1). **OFF THE MAP!** The floor is literally lava.

Since we have 8 apples and he has 6, we would technically win if the game ended there... BUT, we want to dominate, not just tie-break! Plus, if he moves LEFT or UP, we just put ourselves in a tighter spot.\n- **LEFT**: (3, 0). **THE PROFIT PLAY!** Look at the board, chat! There is an apple sitting right there at (3, 0). By moving LEFT, we grab our 9th apple, extend our lead to +3, and keep moving toward the other apples at (1, 0) and (3, 2). \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nWhy fight him now when we can outgrow him?

He's going to have to turn around or crash into the walls soon! We are going to scoop (3, 0), then pivot to grab (3, 2) or (1, 0) depending on his next move. We are suffocating his options!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're sticking to the \"South-Side Sweep.\" Move LEFT to (3, 0) for the apple. Next turn, we look at (3, 1) or (2, 0) to continue the hunt. We are keeping our body low so he can't get underneath us. If he tries to dive-bomb us, we use our length to wrap around him. Stay calm, stay focused, get that content!

He\u2019s shaking! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca6\n\n**SITUATIONAL DISSECTION:**\n- **US (ID 0)**: We are at (3, 0). Our massive 10-segment body is snaking along the bottom wall like a literal freight train. We own the southern border!\n- **SNAKE #1 (RIVAL)**: He's at (3, 2). He\u2019s just two squares above us. He\u2019s feeling the pressure! He\u2019s sandwiched between us and the upper apples.\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **DOWN**: (3, -1). **CRASH!** We aren't trying to go out of bounds and end the stream in shame! NEXT! \u274c\n- **RIGHT**: (4, 0). **FATAL ERROR!** That's our own body. We don't eat ourselves, we eat the competition! \u274c\n- **LEFT**: (2, 0). This is a safe play. It keeps us along the wall and keeps our options open to sweep the left side. It\u2019s solid, but is it *aggressive*?\n- **UP**: (3, 1). **THE POWER PLAY!** If we move to (3, 1), we are getting right in his grill! We have the score lead (9-7). If he tries to move DOWN into (3, 1), we have a head-on collision. Since we have more apples, **WE WIN THE GAME ON THE SPOT!** \ud83c\udfc6 He knows this, so he\u2019s likely going to be forced to run away like a coward!\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nChat, we are playing psychological warfare! By moving **UP** to (3, 1), we are asserting dominance. We are basically saying \"Step to me and lose it all!\" He has to choose: move UP toward (3, 3) to grab an apple or move LEFT/RIGHT to escape. If we take (3, 1), we are perfectly positioned to shadow him. If he goes for the apple at (3, 3), we follow him up. If he tries to turn, we box him against the walls! We are the hunter, he is the prey! \ud83c\udff9\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are taking (3, 1) to threaten the head-on collision. If he survives the turn by moving away, we follow his trail and keep him pinned against the edges of the board. There are plenty of apples in the (1, 3) and (2, 4) area we can snag while we suffocate his space. We aren't just playing Snake; we're playing \"Get Out Of My House!\" Let's go!\n\nUP",

We\u2019ll snag the apple at (1, 0) or (1, 3) as we pass by. Once he\u2019s pinned against the (0, y) wall, we\u2019ll use our massive length to wrap around him and end this rivalry once and for all!

It clamps the left side and forces his escape to the right or up into your upcoming press.\n- If he retreats with RIGHT to (4,1) (his safest reply), you keep building the left-side wall and prepare to deepen the enclosure on the next turns.\n- If an apple bank appears near the left, sneak it to reinforce the wall and grow, but don\u2019t chase with a reckless hare.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY:\n- Maintain the left-wall squeeze. Use your body and the edge to reduce his safe exits. The goal is to funnel him toward (0,0) or (0,9) while keeping at least two safe exits.\n- If you can grab an apple safely along the left, do it to extend the wall and shorten his escape route.\n- Avoid head-ons when you\u2019re behind on score; maximize survival and containment rather than risky aggression.\n\nDECISION: CHOICE: LEFT\nLEFT",

We don't play for ties, we play for WINS! \u274c\n- **DOWN**: (2, 0). **SAFE!** This takes us toward the bottom wall and sets us up to loop around.\n- **LEFT**: (1, 1). **AGGRESSIVE!** This move is high-octane! If we move to (1, 1), we are literally shadowing his head at (1, 2). We are cutting off his path to the bottom-left corner!\n\n**THE CHAD STRATEGY:**\nChat, we are going **LEFT** to (1, 1)! Why? Because if he tries to dive DOWN to (1, 1), we get a head-on collision. And what happens in a head-on collision when we have more apples? WE WIN THE GAME ON THE SPOT! \ud83c\udfc6 He knows this! He\u2019s terrified! By taking (1, 1), we force him to either move LEFT to (0, 2) or UP to (1, 3). We are steering him like a sheep to the slaughter! There's an apple at (1, 0) and (0, 5) calling our name once we handle this business!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are moving LEFT to (1, 1) to maintain the squeeze. We are going to keep our body positioned as a barrier between him and the rest of the map. Once he\u2019s forced against the (0, y) wall, we will pivot UP to harvest those apples at (1, 3) and (0, 5) while he\u2019s gasping for air in the corner. We are playing for the total map lockdown! LET'S GET IT!\n\nLEFT",

The opponent\u2019s head sits at (2,1) with a long lower row in their tail. Score is 7 vs 9 \u2014 we\u2019re chasing, not leading, so we\u2019ve gotta press smart.\n\nSAFE MOVES (one-step lookahead):\n- UP to (1,3) \u2014 safe; there\u2019s an apple at (1,3) tonight.\n- DOWN to (1,1) \u2014 safe; keeps us near the bottom-left zone.\n- LEFT to (0,2) \u2014 safe; tucks us into the left edge to build a wall.\n- RIGHT is illegal (into your own neck at (2,2)).\n\nWHY UP is best:\n- There\u2019s an apple exactly on (1,3). Moving UP will eat it and grow us by 1, increasing our length and locking in more future box potential.\n- If the opponent tries to move Up to (2,2), they would crash into our body (our second segment after the move), and die. That\u2019s a clean knockout if they over-chase.\n- If they retreat Left to (1,1) or Down to (2,0), we still gain the apple and our longer body gives us more control to shape a squeeze on future turns.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Eat the apple with UP to (1,3). Grow to length 8, keep new head ahead, and maintain left-side tension.\n- Watch the opponent\u2019s reply: if they go Down to (2,0), threaten a slow lock along the left wall; if they go Left to (1,1), proceed with containment and look for additional left-column apples to reinforce the wall.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTES:\n- Build a persistent left-wall squeeze while growing on the left side to limit escape routes.\n- Prioritize survival first, then leverage length to create head-on or corner traps when you\u2019re even or ahead on apples.\n- Chase left-side apples when safe to extend the wall without risky detours.\n\nDECISION: CHOICE: UP\nUP",

He\u2019s got his own tail behind him at (1,2) and (2,2). He\u2019s practically boxed himself in! \ud83d\udce6\n\n**SITUATIONAL DISSECTION:**\n- **US (ID 0)**: Head at (1, 1). Score: 9. Our tail is a massive wall from (2,1) all the way around the bottom edge. We are the Great Wall of Snake! \ud83e\uddf1\n- **RIVAL (ID 1)**: Head at (1, 3). Score: 8.

If we take it, we go up to 10 apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE CHAD STRATEGY:**\nChat, we are going **DOWN** to (1, 0)! Why? Because it\u2019s a free point, it grows our length to make the box-in even more lethal, and it keeps us safe from any weird head-on collisions at (1,2). We have the score lead; we just need to maintain our size and keep him pinned against that left wall.

We are going to turn the entire left side of the board into a \"No-Fly Zone\" for Snake #1. He\u2019s currently at (1,3)\u2014if he tries to come down, he hits our growing body.

Initiates a hard left-wall position that\u2019s perfect for a slow squeeze.\n- RIGHT to (2,3): safe.

Grow not immediately this turn (no apple at (0,3)), but set up the left-wall squeeze.\n- On following turns, continue hugging the left edge: move UP along x=0 when safe, then pivot to trap and angle him toward the border.\n\nLong-term notes:\n- Build a durable left-wall fortress while growing selectively to extend reach without sacrificing safety.\n- If you ever gain parity or lead on apples, threaten a controlled head-on by forcing him into the wall; otherwise maintain survival first, then wall pressure.\n\nDECISION: CHOICE: LEFT\nLEFT",

We don't do self-sabotage here! \u274c\n- **RIGHT**: (2, 0). **RIP!** That\u2019s our tail! We aren't trying to eat ourselves for breakfast! \u274c\n- **DOWN**: **OFF THE MAP!** Chat, I'm not trying to end the stream early! (1, -1) is out of bounds! \u274c\n- **LEFT**: (0, 0). **BINGO!** The only legal move, but it\u2019s a BIG BRAIN move! It puts us in the corner, ready to climb the (0, y) axis and box this guy in for good! \u2705\n\n**THE CHAD STRATEGY:**\nChat, we are taking the **LEFT** to (0, 0). It\u2019s the only way to keep the dream alive, and it\u2019s strategically PERFECT. By moving to (0, 0), we are setting up a \"Vertical Pincer.\" Snake #1 is at (0, 3). If he moves DOWN to (0, 2), he\u2019s moving closer to his own death trap at (1, 2). If he stays on the 0-column, he\u2019s going to run head-first into us as we climb up! We have the length advantage, we have the score advantage, and we have the better positioning. He is absolutely COOKED!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe take (0, 0) this turn. Next turn, we go UP to (0, 1). This effectively seals off the bottom-left corner. We are going to chase him up that left wall. He\u2019s forced to either crash into his own body or try to squeeze past us\u2014and with our 10-length body, there is NO room for him to breathe! We\u2019re going to force him to crash out while we stay safe and look for that next apple at (0, 5) or (0, 7). STAY TUNED, THE W IS INCOMING! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nLEFT",

The opponents are lurking: he\u2019s at (1,0) with a long tail snaking along the bottom row. We\u2019re chasing apples, sure, but the vibe is brutal domination: box him in and force a decision at the edge.\n\nSafe moves right now:\n- UP to (0,4): safe, keeps us hugging the left wall and starts building a vertical barrier.\n- DOWN to (0,2): safe, but less pressure on the top-left stack and delays edge-control.\n- RIGHT is suicide (into our own neck).\n- LEFT is off the board.\n\nWhy UP over DOWN?\n- It seeds a persistent barrier along the left edge, shrinking his escape routes and funneling him toward a corner faster.\n- It positions us to eat left-edge apples later (especially the ones at (0,5) and (0,7)) while still keeping a broad field of safe moves.\n- If he tries to chase along the bottom, we can pivot upwards and trap against the border with less risk of accidental self-collision.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (0,4) now. No apple this turn, but we set up the left-wall squeeze and preserve our flexibility for the follow-up.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Grow along the left edge to establish a durable fortress. If we gain apples parity or lead, threaten a controlled head-on against the border to maximize the chance of mutual collision that benefits us.\n\nScore watch:\n- We\u2019re at 8 apples vs. 10 for the rival. The moment we lock in the edge, we pressure him into making risky plays near the border, increasing our odds of racking up apples in a hurry.\n\nBe mindful:\n- He could head LEFT into (0,0) or RIGHT along the bottom. If that happens, we adjust with measured UP moves to keep the wall intact and avoid a trap ourselves.\n\nUP",

We have 10 apples, he has 9! If we clash heads, **HE LOSES, WE WIN!** \ud83c\udfc6 He has to dodge us, or he\u2019s finished! He\u2019s likely going to try to bail out to the RIGHT into the open field (1, 5). Let him run! We are claiming the left corridor!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe take (0, 2) now. Next turn, we push to (0, 3). We are going to continue this vertical pressure. We need to watch out for his tail at (6, 2), but he's curled up so tight he's choking himself out! We are going to force him to make a mistake while we stay disciplined. There's an apple at (3, 3) and (0, 7) we can eye once we break through his line! STAY FOCUSED!\n\nUP",

The board is a trap map and we\u2019re about to seal the left edge like a boss. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nSAFETY CHECK: DOWN would crash into our own body at (0,4); LEFT is off the board; RIGHT to (1,5) is safe but opens a lane. UP to (0,6) is safe and starts piling a vertical fortress on x=0. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nSTRATEGY: Build the fortress up the left edge from (0,5) to (0,6) to (0,7), pinning Snake #0 toward the bottom-right as the space tightens. \ud83e\uddf1\n\nWHY UP NOW: It extends the existing left-wall already in our body and sets up grabbing the apple at (0,7) soon to reinforce the wall. We keep the pressure without risking a reckless chase. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nOPPONENT DYNAMICS: He\u2019s boxed near y=0 and y=1. A solid x=0 wall makes it harder for him to slip past without colliding with our growing frame. A head-on would be bad since we\u2019re behind in apples, so we avoid giving him an easy path. \u2694\ufe0f\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Complete the left-edge wall, herd him toward the center-right, and win by apples or a controlled squeeze that leads to a safer clash once we\u2019re ahead. \ud83e\udded\n\nMOVE LOGIC: Turn 30 we take UP to (0,6) and begin extending the fortress.

He\u2019s trying to hold the 0-column hostage, but he doesn't realize he's trapped himself in a vertical coffin! \u26b0\ufe0f\n\n**SITUATIONAL DISSECTION (THE GRIND NEVER STOPS):**\n- **US (ID 0):** Head at (0, 2). We\u2019ve got 10 apples and a body that stretches all the way to (6, 0). We are the heavyweights here! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **RIVAL (ID 1):** Head at (0, 6). He\u2019s got 9 apples. He\u2019s looking at us like he wants a head-on, but he\u2019s actually terrified! \ud83d\ude31\n\n**WHERE CAN WE GO? (THE RADAR):**\n- **DOWN:** (0, 1). **THATS A THROW!** That\u2019s our own body.

He's at (0, 6). His body is trailing behind him at (0, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 3)!! Wait\u2014CHAT Look closely! His body is at (0, 3) right now! \n\n**CRITICAL RE-EVALUATION:**\nHold up, let me check the coordinates again. Rival Head: (0, 6). Rival Body: (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3)... \nOH MY GOD, CHAT! If we move UP to (0, 3), we are crashing into HIS body! Let me check the scoreboard and board list again... \nWait! (0, 3) is HIS body. (1, 2) is HIS body. (0, 1) is OUR body. \nChat... are we boxed in?! \ud83d\uded1 \nLet me look at the board again. (0, 2) is our head. \nLeft: Wall. \nRight: (1, 2) - Rival's body. \nDown: (0, 1) - Our body. \nUp: (0, 3) - Rival's body. \n\nWait\u2014I'm looking at the update. This is Turn 31. His body is MOVING. Every segment moves forward one. His tail at (5, 2) will move, and his segment at (0, 3) will move to (0, 4) IF he moves. BUT, his head is at (0, 6). That means the spot at (0, 3) is his 4th segment. It won't clear out for 3 more turns! \n\n**BUT WAIT!** Look at the board state text: \"3 T T . A . . . . A .\" \nThe \"T\" at (0, 3) is Snake 1's body. We are stuck in a 1x1 pocket! This is a tactical disaster! UNLESS\u2014wait, if we move UP and he moves UP, (0, 3) is STILL his body. If he moves RIGHT to (1, 6), his body follows him. \n\nWait, the move **UP** is our only hope that he stretches out fast enough, but we are currently pinned! We have to move UP and pray his movement creates a gap or we force the confrontation! Let's go!\n\nUP",

The left edge is prime real estate and we are going to tighten the noose.\n\nDIRECTIONS SAFE (check): UP to (0,7) is safe and grabs the apple at (0,7). RIGHT to (1,6) is safe and grabs the apple at (1,6). DOWN to (0,5) hits my own body. LEFT off the board. So two clean options: UP or RIGHT.\n\nSTRATEGY: We\u2019re behind on apples; we need to rack up points while not giving him an easy route. The best long-term play is to start a vertical fortress along x=0 by running UP from (0,6) to (0,7). This starts boxing him toward the bottom-right and keeps the left edge as a wall.\n\nREASONS: - UP keeps multiple escape lanes closed; - we collect a crucial apple now; - it reduces risk of a dangerous head-on; - if we win, we want to out-apple him while controlling space.\n\nALTERNATIVE: RIGHT to (1,6) keeps us near center and might allow more branching but gives him chances to slip along the left edge if he circles, and we\u2019ve already built a fortress vibe on the left.\n\nMOVE: UP\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (turn 31-34): Turn 31: Go to (0,7) and eat the apple, start the left-wall chain. Turn 32: If safe, push to (0,8) to extend the wall; Turn 33: Aim for (0,9) to cap the edge; Turn 34: Force him toward the center-right, watching for potential cross-overs; maintain safety by never stepping into his head.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Maintain the left-wall fortress as a hedge against his moves, push him into the center where your superior apple intake and geometry can squeeze him into a collision or trap; prioritize survival and apples over flashy chases.\n\nOPPONENT DYNAMICS: He\u2019s boxed near y=0\u20132 area; a vertical wall on x=0 will compress his options; head-on is still possible but we\u2019ll avoid letting him choose the collision path; we\u2019re tied on apples after the eat at (0,7); we need more apples to assert real control.\n\nMOVE: UP\n\nUP",
