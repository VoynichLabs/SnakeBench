It also puts me in a better position to decide my next move calmly since there are no walls or immediate threats around (the other snake is far away at (0, 4)).\n\n4. **Wall Danger**: A move to the left will put me at (6, 3), leaving me far away from any walls (safe zone).

The next closest apples will likely be (7, 1) below me and (7, 7) above me. I'll decide based on their proximity and the movements of Snake #0.\n\n### Decision:\nMy move will be **LEFT** to eat the apple at (6, 3).

My body has grown, and I now have 1 point.\n   - My current position at (6, 3) leaves me plenty of safe moves. No walls are nearby, and the enemy snake at (0, 5) is very far from me, so there is no immediate threat.\n\n4. **Prioritizing My Next Move**:\n   - **Apple (7, 1)**: This apple is 2 moves away (down, then right). Moving toward this apple allows me to gain another point while staying in a relatively safe position.\n   - **Other Apples**: All other apples are far enough away that going for them now would waste multiple moves and create unnecessary risks.\n\n5. **Move Evaluation**:\n   - **DOWN (to (6, 2))**: This is the best move as it brings me closer to the apple at (7, 1) without any risks. My body would stretch to (6, 3), meaning I won\u2019t collide with myself or any other snake.\n   - **UP/LEFT/RIGHT**: These moves either move me away from the nearest apple or are unnecessary at this point.\n\n6. **Enemy Snake Threat**:\n   - Snake #0 is still at (0, 5) and poses no immediate danger, but it may begin moving toward any apples in the future. Its priority will likely be the apple at (0, 8) or (0, 1), as they are closest to its current position.\n\n### Strategy for the Following Turn:\n- After moving down to (6, 2), my next move will likely be RIGHT to reach the apple at (7, 1). I\u2019ll reassess based on the board state after this turn, but targeting apples while staying as central as possible will remain my current approach.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: DOWN"

This is the closest apple and the obvious target for the next move.\n   - **(0, 8)**: Very far and irrelevant for now.\n   - **(2, 7)**: Even farther and not critical at this stage.\n   - **(7, 7)**: Too high up and currently not worth pursuing.\n   - **(0, 1)**: Very far to the west and not a smart option right now.\n\n   **(7, 1)** is clearly my priority since it is the easiest apple to reach and can be collected in 2 moves by either moving DOWN then RIGHT, or RIGHT then DOWN.\n\n3. **Evaluating Moves**:\n   - **DOWN to (6, 1)**:\n     - Safely takes me closer to the apple at **(7, 1)**.\n     - This move minimizes risk since there are no walls, snake bodies, or obstacles in or near this direction.\n     - It positions me to move RIGHT next turn to eat the apple at (7, 1).\n   - **RIGHT to (7, 2)**:\n     - Also safely moves me closer to the apple at (7, 1).\n     - Likewise, this move minimizes risk and positions me to move DOWN next turn to eat the apple.\n     - However, moving horizontally first would place me closer to the board edges, which is riskier for future movements.\n\n   Choosing DOWN first appears safer and avoids moving too close to the edge unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Other Considerations**:\n   - **Safety**: Snake #0 is still located at **(0, 6)** with an empty body and poses no current threat. This snake may move UP or LEFT toward the apples at (0, 8) and (0, 1). Since it is far away, there is no immediate competition for the apple at (7, 1).\n   - **Future Planning**: After collecting the apple at (7, 1), I will reassess the next closest apple. At that point, the apples at (7, 7) or (2, 7) may become potential targets depending on my position and body growth.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Moving DOWN to **(6, 1)** is strategically sound as it keeps me centered, minimizes risks, and progresses directly toward the nearest apple at **(7, 1)**.\n   - TURN 2 PLAN: After moving DOWN, I will likely move RIGHT to (7, 1) to collect the apple and grow.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: DOWN"

It is my obvious next target.  \n     - **(2, 7)**: Still far away, low priority for now.  \n     - **(0, 1)**: Very far west, irrelevant currently.  \n     - **(5, 0)**: A little closer than the apple at (0, 1), but still not the best choice compared to (7, 7).  \n     - **(3, 5)**: Moderate distance but still farther than (7, 7).  \n\n     For now, my primary focus is to move toward the apple at **(7, 7)**.\n\n3. **Path to (7, 7):**\n   - From my current position (**(7, 1)**), the shortest path to (7, 7) involves moving **UP**, staying aligned in the same column.

Risks and Pathing Considerations:**\n- **Walls**: I am safe for several moves going **UP**; the wall at the top does not come into play for now.  \n- **Self-Collision**: My body is trailing safely downward, and there is no chance of colliding with myself in the short term.  \n- **Enemy Collision**: No enemy snake is nearby to interfere.   \n- **Priority**: Reaching the apple at (7, 7) should remain my focus.\n\n---\n\n#### **5.

There are no obstacles or threats in the path, so this apple should remain my primary target.  \n- **(3, 5):** This apple could be a secondary target after collecting (7, 7). It is several moves away and would require heading west, but I\u2019ll reassess its priority after collecting the primary apple.  \n- **(0, 1)** and **(5, 0):** These apples are far to the south and not logically prioritized given my current position.  \n- **(2, 7):** The apple to the west is still within the likely range of the enemy Snake #0. It\u2019s safer to continue gathering apples in my own relative corner of the board for now.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Enemy Snake (#0):**\n- **Position:** The enemy snake\u2019s head is still at **(3, 7)**, trailing west with a body at **[(2, 7), (1, 7)]**.  \n- **Behavioral Observation:** Snake #0 appears to be pursuing the apple at (2, 7), as it is already positioned near that target. It\u2019s far enough away that it doesn\u2019t interfere with my strategy at this time.  \n\n---\n\n#### **4. Strategic Risks and Considerations:**\n- **Self-Collision:** My body is directly below my current position along the (7, N) column. As long as I continue moving **UP**, there\u2019s no risk of collision.  \n- **Wall Proximity:** With the board ending at y = 9, I will eventually need to make a lateral move. However, collecting the apple at (7, 7) will provide the opportunity to reassess my next step and adjust my path.  \n- **Enemy Interaction:** Snake #0 is operating far from my immediate zone and poses no immediate threat. Since they\u2019re likely focused on the westward apple, our paths are unlikely to cross this turn (or the next few turns).  \n\n---\n\n#### **5. Pathing and Next Steps:**\n- The optimal move for this turn is to continue moving **UP** toward (7, 7). This is the shortest path, and the apple should be collected in two turns if I maintain this course.  \n- After obtaining the apple at **(7, 7)**, I will carefully reevaluate the board state and determine the next best apple to pursue. The most likely candidate will be (3, 5), but I will also consider new conditions such as potential enemy movements or newly spawned apples.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Decision:**\n- My best move for this turn is **UP**. This ensures continued progress toward the closest apple while avoiding any self-collision, wall collision, or unnecessary lateral moves.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Next Move: UP**  \n\n---\n\n#### **Note to Self for Next Turn:**\n- If the apple at **(7, 7)** is collected, recalculate distances and priorities for the remaining apples.  \n- Stay alert for new threats or movements from Snake #0, particularly if it changes course or begins contesting nearby apples."

Recap of Current State and Last Move:**\n- **Current Board Status:**\n  - My snake's **head** is at **(7, 6)**, with the body trailing at **[(7, 5), (7, 4)]**.\n  - My last move was **UP**, and I am now within **1 step of the apple at (7, 7)**.\n- **Apple Priority:**\n  - The closest apple is still at **(7, 7)**, directly above me. Moving **UP** will allow me to collect it.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Apple Locations and New Plan After Collecting (7, 7):**\n1. **After Collecting:** Once I collect (7, 7), the newly grown snake body will occupy **[(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)]**. From this position:\n   - The next closest apple will likely be **(4, 2)** (a reasonable distance southwest), or perhaps **(3, 5)** depending on board conditions.\n   - Post-collection movement will need careful consideration of pathing to the next apple.\n\n2. **Future Apple Priorities:**\n   - **(0, 1)** and **(5, 0)** remain less optimal targets due to distance.  \n   - **(3, 5)** could be a good next target depending on Snake #0\u2019s next few moves.  \n   - Monitor Snake #0\u2019s behavior and reassess threats or competition as new situations arise.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Enemy Snake (#0) Position and Behavior:**\n- Snake #0 remains at **(3, 6)**, likely still pursuing **(3, 5)** or **(2, 7)**. There\u2019s minimal chance of interaction between me and Snake #0 at this time, as we\u2019re occupying opposite quadrants of the board.\n- However, if Snake #0 collects the apple at **(2, 7)** and moves closer west, I\u2019ll need to monitor its path toward **(3, 5)** more carefully.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Risks and Considerations:**\n- **Immediate Path Risks:**\n  - Continuing **UP** to collect the apple at (7, 7) poses no risk\u2014there are no collisions with walls, my own body, or Snake #0 in this path.  \n- **Post-Collection Risks:**\n  - After collecting (7, 7), my movement options will depend on whether Snake #0 starts encroaching on the board\u2019s center area. Moving toward (3, 5) means potentially entering Snake #0\u2019s operating space.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Decision and Strategy:**\n- My optimal move right now is to continue **UP** and collect the apple at (7, 7). This is the most logical goal given proximity and risk level.\n- Once the apple is collected, I\u2019ll need to analyze whether to target **(3, 5)** as the next apple or safely pivot toward the southern apples like **(4, 2)** or **(5, 0)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Next Move: UP**\n\n---\n\n#### **Note to Self for Next Turn:**\n- Monitor Snake #0\u2019s movements carefully after collecting (7, 7). If it moves aggressively toward the center or eastern apples, avoid unnecessary competition.\n- Depending on the updated board state, likely targets for next turn will either be **(3, 5)** or **(4, 2)**. Reassess distances and risks accordingly."

Let me analyze the current situation step by step before continuing with a move decision.\n\n---\n\n### **Thinking Out Loud**\n\n#### **1. My Current State:**\n- **Position & Direction:**\n  - My snake\u2019s head is currently at **(7, 6)**, moving **UP** in the previous turn.\n  - My body is trailing at **[(7, 5), (7, 4)]**, and I am **1 tile away** from the apple at **(7, 7)**.\n- **Next Immediate Move:**\n  - Moving **UP** will place my head at (7, 7), consuming the apple. My body will grow by 1 segment, resulting in my new body occupying positions **[(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)]**.\n\n#### **2. Nearest Apples and Prioritization Post-Consumption:**\n- Once I consume the apple at (7, 7), here\u2019s the breakdown of reachable apples by proximity:\n  1. **(3, 5)**: Approximately **5 steps** southwest. This seems like the next-best target. However, **Snake #0** might also be targeting this apple, as it is relatively close to it. Careful planning around Snake #0 is crucial.\n  2. **(4, 2)**: Roughly **6 steps** southwest. Less competition over this apple, as it is farther from Snake #0. This could be a safer alternative if Snake #0 dominates the area around (3, 5).\n  3. **(5, 0) & (0, 1)**: These are farther away, approximately **7-9 tiles** depending on the path. At this time, they are low-priority, but they can be fallbacks if other paths are blocked.\n\n#### **3. Enemy Snake (#0):**\n- Snake #0\u2019s head is at **(4, 6)**, with its body at **[(3, 6), (3, 7)]**. Its behavior suggests it may be heading west or staying near the apple at (3, 5).\n- My trajectory toward (3, 5) could result in a potential conflict with Snake #0. I will need to watch its exact position after this next turn to reassess this path.\n\n#### **4. Risks in Current Scenario:**\n- **Immediate Risk: None.**\n  - Moving directly **UP** to (7, 7) to collect the apple is straightforward with no risk of collision.\n- **Post-Collection Risks:**\n  - Snake #0\u2019s proximity to **(3, 5)** presents an indirect threat if I target the same apple next.\n  - My growing body might restrict my path back toward the board's lower-left quadrant after turning downward.\n\n#### **5. Strategy Moving Forward:**\n- The safest immediate move is to **collect the apple at (7, 7)** by moving **UP**.\n- After growing, I should reanalyze the distances and competition for apples. My leading options would be:\n  1. **(3, 5)** if Snake #0 moves away and it remains open.\n  2. **(4, 2)** if Snake #0 becomes a threat in the southwest area.\n- I should maintain a cautious approach, prioritizing survival and safe navigation over risky apple collection.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Next Move: UP**\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy for Next Turn:**\n- After consuming the apple at (7, 7), re-evaluate Snake #0\u2019s position and path.\n- Plan a route either toward **(3, 5)** or **(4, 2)** while maintaining flexibility to adjust if Snake #0 becomes a threat."

Current Board Position (Post-Apple Consumption Update):**\n- **Current Snake #1 Position:**\n  - Snake #1 is now at **(7, 7)** after consuming the apple at that coordinate on the last turn.\n  - The body has grown and is now: **[(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)]**.\n\n- **Remaining Apples on the Board:**\n  - (0, 1)\n  - (5, 0)\n  - (3, 5)\n  - (4, 2)\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Examining Threats:**\n- **Snake #0 Position and Behavior:**\n  - Snake #0\u2019s head is at (4, 5), and its body is trailing at [(4, 6), (3, 6)].\n  - Snake #0 may be maneuvering toward the apple at **(3, 5)** (the closest apple to it). Its movements toward this area could potentially create a crowded or contested zone for us as well. My goal is to avoid risky moves that put my snake in conflict with Snake #0 unnecessarily, while still working to maximize apple collection.\n  \n- **Obstacles:**\n  - I need to ensure my growing body does not block my passage down the board or toward an apple. Planning ahead for body navigation is critical.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Prioritizing Apples Strategically:**\n- **Reachable Apples (Sorted by Distance):**\n  1. **(3, 5):** \n     - Closest apple to my current position.\n     - Approximately 6 tiles away with a safe path: **LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN**.\n     - This is also the apple Snake #0 is most likely targeting, creating some risk. If Snake #0 moves toward this apple next, I should possibly redirect elsewhere to avoid direct competition.\n\n  2. **(4, 2):**\n     - Slightly farther at 8 tiles away, but it\u2019s considerably less competitive since Snake #0 is farther from this region.\n     - A safe estimated path could be: **LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN**.\n     - This apple could be an excellent fallback based on Snake #0\u2019s movements.\n\n  3. **(5, 0) & (0, 1):**\n     - Farther away compared to the two closest apples. These apples will be considered only if the southwestern region becomes too dangerous or controlled by Snake #0.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Immediate Strategy:**\n- **Move Toward (3, 5):**\n  - My immediate plan is to move toward the apple at (3, 5) while monitoring Snake #0\u2019s movements. Depending on where Snake #0 turns next, I can:\n    1. Continue toward (3, 5) if it stays open.\n    2. Switch course toward (4, 2) if Snake #0 commits to the (3, 5) apple.\n\n- **Safe Movement Planning:**\n  - My path involves moving horizontally (LEFT) first, as this keeps me far from my own body while progressing toward the next apple. This spacing avoids self-collisions and ensures flexibility in case I have to reroute.\n\n---\n\n### **Planned Next Move: LEFT**\n\n- This positions me at **(6, 7)**, maintaining a safe distance from walls, Snake #0, and my own body.\n- After this move, I will observe Snake #0\u2019s position and re-evaluate whether to continue to (3, 5) or shift toward (4, 2).\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy for the Following Turns:**\n1. Monitor Snake #0\u2019s trajectory next turn.\n2. Continue toward (3, 5) unless Snake #0 makes it impractical.\n3. Prioritize safety over risking conflict for apples.\n\nDecided Next Move: **LEFT**"

          "rationale": "### **Thinking Out Loud**\n\n#### **1. Current Position:**\n- My head is currently at **(7, 7)**, and my body is trailing as follows: **[(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)]**.\n- I'm moving LEFT from my previous move, and my immediate next steps must avoid self-collision, enemy snakes, and strategically approach apples.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Reviewing the Remaining Apples:**\nHere are the distances to each apple (considering safe and direct paths):\n\n1. **(3, 5):**\n   - Nearest apple, approximately 6 tiles away.\n   - Suggested Path: Left until aligned with x = 3, then move downward. Path: **LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.**\n   - **Risk Factor:** Snake #0\u2019s head is currently at **(3, 5)** and is likely aiming for it. There is a high likelihood of collision or conflict if I continue toward this apple. It would be unwise to prioritize it unless Snake #0 turns away.\n\n2. **(4, 2):**\n   - A bit farther, but safer. Approximately 8 tiles away with a clear path.\n   - Suggested Path: Move LEFT and DOWN while keeping maximum distance from Snake #0. Path: **LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.**\n   - **Risk Factor:** Minimal, as long as Snake #0 doesn\u2019t redirect here.\n\n3. **(5, 0):**\n   - Approximately 9 tiles away. Reaching it would involve traveling all the way south and then veering east.\n   - **Risk Factor:** Farther away compared to nearer apples, so this is a lower-priority target for now.\n\n4. **(0, 1):**\n   - Furthest apple, requiring more than 15+ tiles to reach. This can only become viable if all future apples in closer proximity are consumed or contestable.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Evaluating Threats and Movement Options:**\n- **Snake #0:** \n   - Snake #0 is likely targeting (3, 5) as it is directly next to this apple. If I move directly toward (3, 5), I risk getting into a conflict (or trap) with Snake #0. I will avoid this immediate competition unless Snake #0 changes course.\n   - Instead, I should focus on the **second-closest apple at (4, 2)** since there\u2019s currently no direct competition for it.\n\n- **Self-Collision Risk:**\n   - My body currently extends to the LEFT and DOWN, meaning I need to avoid turning sharply into **(7, 6)** or blocking my own route on subsequent moves. Planning open spaces becomes a priority.\n  \n---\n\n#### **4. Strategy for the Next Few Turns:**\n- My current safest goal is **(4, 2)**.\n- **Planned Path to (4, 2):** \n  - First move **LEFT** to create room and align my head closer to the path leading downward.\n  - Subsequent moves will trend downward while avoiding my own body.\n\n---\n\n#### **Next Move Decision:**\n**LEFT**\n\n- **Why LEFT?**\n  - Keeps me away from my own body.\n  - Progresses me toward the path for (4, 2).\n  - Maintains flexibility to pivot or redirect based on Snake #0\u2019s decisions.\n\nFuture Observation:\n- Carefully monitor Snake #0\u2019s movement after my next turn. If Snake #0 changes course away from (3, 5), I can potentially reassess and move there instead. Otherwise, I will maintain my course toward (4, 2).\n\n**Decided Next Move: LEFT**"
