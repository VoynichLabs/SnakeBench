The closest apple to my head at (0, 9) is at (7, 3), which is 7 units away. The enemy snake is at (3, 0), which is 7 units away from me.\n\nMy current strategy is to move towards the apple at (7, 3) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake. I need to ensure that I don't run into the enemy snake or myself.\n\nFor my next move, I should continue moving in the same direction as my last move, which was UP. This will bring me closer to the apple at (7, 3) while also keeping me away from the enemy snake.\n\n**Next move: UP**",

Moving right with my current head position will put me closer to the apple, and I'll be able to assess my next move from there.\n\nI'll consider my snake's current position and the enemy's position while making my decision. My head is at (2, 0) initially, but my last move was RIGHT, so my current head position is (3, 0).\n\nLet's see where I'll end up if I move right. I should now be at (4, 0), which puts me one step closer to the apple at (7, 6).\n\nNow that I've got some horizontal progress, I can re-evaluate my next move. My goal is to get to the apple at (7, 6), but I need to increase my Y-coordinate (go up) to get there. Since I'm currently at (4, 0), I'll need to head up to make progress towards the apple.\n\nMy next move: UP.",
