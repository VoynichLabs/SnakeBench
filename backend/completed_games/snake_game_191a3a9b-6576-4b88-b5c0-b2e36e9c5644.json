There's another snake, Snake #0, at (3,3). The apples are at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (3,4), (4,5). The goal is to collect apples without dying to gain points.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best direction to move. The snake is currently at (7,8). Let's look at the surrounding cells. Up from (7,8) would be (7,9), which is the top wall, so that's invalid. Down is (7,7), which is empty. Left is (6,8), also empty. Right is (8,8), which is empty. So the possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (6,5). That's two to the left and three down from the current position. Another apple is at (5,0), which is further away. There's also an apple at (9,9), which is two to the right and one up, but moving up from (7,8) is into the wall, so that's not possible. The apples at (3,4) and (4,5) are also quite a distance away.\n\nSnake #0 is at (3,3), which is far from the current position, so it's not an immediate threat. The main priority should be to move towards the nearest apple at (6,5). To get there, the snake needs to move left twice and down three times. Alternatively, moving down first might be safer to get closer.\n\nWait, moving left from (7,8) to (6,8) is possible. Then from there, moving down to (6,7), (6,6), and so on towards (6,5). That seems like a good path. Alternatively, moving down first to (7,7) and then left might also work, but moving left first might be better to get closer to the target column.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT to (6,8). Then, in the next moves, continue moving down towards (6,5). This path avoids walls and the enemy snake. It's important to plan ahead to ensure the snake doesn't run into itself or the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering the rules, if the snake moves into an apple, it grows and gains a point.

            "rationale": "<think>Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let's see, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake's head is at (6,8), and I don't have any body segments yet. There are several apples on the board: at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (4,5), and (9,2). There's also another snake, Snake #0, with its head at (3,4) and a body segment at (3,3).\n\nMy last move was LEFT, which took me from (7,8) to (6,8). Now I need to decide where to go next. I want to get to an apple to grow and gain points, but I also need to avoid hitting walls or the other snake.\n\nLooking at my current position at (6,8), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP would take me to (6,9), which is the top wall, so that's not possible. Moving DOWN would take me to (6,7), which is empty. Moving LEFT would take me to (5,8), which is also empty. Moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), but that's where I just came from, and there's nothing there except my previous position, which is now empty.\n\nSo, my options are DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8). I'm trying to get to the apple at (6,5), which is directly below me. Moving DOWN to (6,7) would get me closer to that apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) might take me away from the apple, but it could also position me to move towards other apples.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (5,0), which is far down and to the left. If I go LEFT to (5,8), I could then start moving DOWN towards (5,0). But that seems like a long journey, and I might run into the other snake or walls along the way.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is closer, so it might be better to go DOWN to (6,7) and then continue moving DOWN towards (6,5). That way, I can collect that apple quickly and gain a point before worrying about the others.\n\nBut I also need to keep an eye on Snake #0. Its head is at (3,4), and it has a body segment at (3,3). That's quite a distance from my current position, so it's probably not an immediate threat. However, if I start moving LEFT towards (5,8), I might be heading in the general direction of Snake #0, which could be risky if it decides to move towards me.\n\nOn the other hand, moving DOWN towards (6,5) keeps me on the right side of the board, away from Snake #0. That seems safer and more direct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the apple at (9,9). It's at the top right corner, but moving there would require going RIGHT from my current position, which isn't possible since I'm at (6,8) and moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), which is empty. Plus, (9,9) is quite far, and I have a closer apple at (6,5).\n\nSo, the best move seems to be DOWN to (6,7). From there, I can continue moving DOWN to (6,6), (6,5), and collect the apple. Once I have that, I can look for the next closest apple, which would likely be at (4,5) or (5,0), depending on my position after eating.\n\nI should also think about the potential for growing my snake. If I collect the apple at (6,5), my snake will have a body segment at (6,8), (6,7), and (6,6), assuming I move straight down. That could block me from moving LEFT or RIGHT in the future, but since I'm heading towards the apple, it's worth the risk.\n\nIn summary, moving DOWN to (6,7) is the best option. It gets me closer to the nearest apple and keeps me away from potential threats. After that, I'll continue moving DOWN to collect the apple and then reassess my next move based on the new board state.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move down towards the apple at (6,5). I'll go DOWN to (6,7) first.\n\nDOWN",

It's at the top right corner, but moving there would require going RIGHT from my current position, which isn't possible since I'm at (6,8) and moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), which is empty. Plus, (9,9) is quite far, and I have a closer apple at (6,5).\n\nSo, the best move seems to be DOWN to (6,7). From there, I can continue moving DOWN to (6,6), (6,5), and collect the apple. Once I have that, I can look for the next closest apple, which would likely be at (4,5) or (5,0), depending on my position after eating.\n\nI should also think about the potential for growing my snake. If I collect the apple at (6,5), my snake will have a body segment at (6,8), (6,7), and (6,6), assuming I move straight down. That could block me from moving LEFT or RIGHT in the future, but since I'm heading towards the apple, it's worth the risk.\n\nIn summary, moving DOWN to (6,7) is the best option. It gets me closer to the nearest apple and keeps me away from potential threats. After that, I'll continue moving DOWN to collect the apple and then reassess my next move based on the new board state.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move down towards the apple at (6,5).

Let's see, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake's head is at (6,7), and I don't have any body segments yet. There are several apples on the board: at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (4,5), and (9,2). There's also another snake, Snake #0, with its head at (4,4) and a body segment at (3,4).\n\nMy last move was DOWN, which took me from (6,8) to (6,7). Now I need to decide where to go next. I want to get to an apple to grow and gain points, but I also need to avoid hitting walls or the other snake.\n\nLooking at my current position at (6,7), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP would take me to (6,8), which is where I just came from and is now empty. Moving DOWN would take me to (6,6), which is empty. Moving LEFT would take me to (5,7), which is also empty. Moving RIGHT would take me to (7,7), which is empty.\n\nSo, my options are UP to (6,8), DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), or RIGHT to (7,7). I'm trying to get to the apple at (6,5), which is directly below me. Moving DOWN to (6,6) would get me closer to that apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,7) might take me away from the apple, but it could also position me to move towards other apples.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (5,0), which is far down and to the left. If I go LEFT to (5,7), I could then start moving DOWN towards (5,0). But that seems like a long journey, and I might run into the other snake or walls along the way.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is closer, so it might be better to go DOWN to (6,6) and then continue moving DOWN towards (6,5). That way, I can collect that apple quickly and gain a point before worrying about the others.\n\nBut I also need to keep an eye on Snake #0. Its head is at (4,4), and it has a body segment at (3,4). That's quite a distance from my current position, so it's probably not an immediate threat. However, if I start moving LEFT towards (5,7), I might be heading in the general direction of Snake #0, which could be risky if it decides to move towards me.\n\nOn the other hand, moving DOWN towards (6,5) keeps me on the right side of the board, away from Snake #0.

            "rationale": "<think>Alright, let's break this down. The user is controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. Their snake has its head at (7,8) and no body. There's another snake, Snake #0, at (3,3). The apples are at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (3,4), (4,5). The goal is to collect apples without dying to gain points.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best direction to move. The snake is currently at (7,8). Let's look at the surrounding cells. Up from (7,8) would be (7,9), which is the top wall, so that's invalid. Down is (7,7), which is empty. Left is (6,8), also empty. Right is (8,8), which is empty. So the possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (6,5). That's two to the left and three down from the current position. Another apple is at (5,0), which is further away. There's also an apple at (9,9), which is two to the right and one up, but moving up from (7,8) is into the wall, so that's not possible. The apples at (3,4) and (4,5) are also quite a distance away.\n\nSnake #0 is at (3,3), which is far from the current position, so it's not an immediate threat. The main priority should be to move towards the nearest apple at (6,5). To get there, the snake needs to move left twice and down three times. Alternatively, moving down first might be safer to get closer.\n\nWait, moving left from (7,8) to (6,8) is possible. Then from there, moving down to (6,7), (6,6), and so on towards (6,5). That seems like a good path. Alternatively, moving down first to (7,7) and then left might also work, but moving left first might be better to get closer to the target column.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT to (6,8). Then, in the next moves, continue moving down towards (6,5). This path avoids walls and the enemy snake. It's important to plan ahead to ensure the snake doesn't run into itself or the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering the rules, if the snake moves into an apple, it grows and gains a point. So, the strategy is to collect as many apples as possible without colliding with walls, the enemy, or itself.\n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT to position (6,8). That's the best option to start moving towards the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move towards the nearest apple. I'll head left first to get closer to (6,5).

            "rationale": "<think>Alright, let's break this down. The user is controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. Their snake has its head at (7,8) and no body. There's another snake, Snake #0, at (3,3). The apples are at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (3,4), (4,5). The goal is to collect apples without dying to gain points.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best direction to move. The snake is currently at (7,8). Let's look at the surrounding cells. Up from (7,8) would be (7,9), which is the top wall, so that's invalid. Down is (7,7), which is empty. Left is (6,8), also empty. Right is (8,8), which is empty. So the possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (6,5). That's two to the left and three down from the current position. Another apple is at (5,0), which is further away. There's also an apple at (9,9), which is two to the right and one up, but moving up from (7,8) is into the wall, so that's not possible. The apples at (3,4) and (4,5) are also quite a distance away.\n\nSnake #0 is at (3,3), which is far from the current position, so it's not an immediate threat. The main priority should be to move towards the nearest apple at (6,5). To get there, the snake needs to move left twice and down three times. Alternatively, moving down first might be safer to get closer.\n\nWait, moving left from (7,8) to (6,8) is possible. Then from there, moving down to (6,7), (6,6), and so on towards (6,5). That seems like a good path. Alternatively, moving down first to (7,7) and then left might also work, but moving left first might be better to get closer to the target column.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT to (6,8). Then, in the next moves, continue moving down towards (6,5). This path avoids walls and the enemy snake. It's important to plan ahead to ensure the snake doesn't run into itself or the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering the rules, if the snake moves into an apple, it grows and gains a point. So, the strategy is to collect as many apples as possible without colliding with walls, the enemy, or itself.\n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT to position (6,8). That's the best option to start moving towards the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move towards the nearest apple. I'll head left first to get closer to (6,5).

Let's see, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake's head is at (6,8), and I don't have any body segments yet. There are several apples on the board: at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (4,5), and (9,2). There's also another snake, Snake #0, with its head at (3,4) and a body segment at (3,3).\n\nMy last move was LEFT, which took me from (7,8) to (6,8). Now I need to decide where to go next. I want to get to an apple to grow and gain points, but I also need to avoid hitting walls or the other snake.\n\nLooking at my current position at (6,8), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP would take me to (6,9), which is the top wall, so that's not possible. Moving DOWN would take me to (6,7), which is empty. Moving LEFT would take me to (5,8), which is also empty. Moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), but that's where I just came from, and there's nothing there except my previous position, which is now empty.\n\nSo, my options are DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8). I'm trying to get to the apple at (6,5), which is directly below me. Moving DOWN to (6,7) would get me closer to that apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) might take me away from the apple, but it could also position me to move towards other apples.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (5,0), which is far down and to the left. If I go LEFT to (5,8), I could then start moving DOWN towards (5,0). But that seems like a long journey, and I might run into the other snake or walls along the way.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is closer, so it might be better to go DOWN to (6,7) and then continue moving DOWN towards (6,5). That way, I can collect that apple quickly and gain a point before worrying about the others.\n\nBut I also need to keep an eye on Snake #0. Its head is at (3,4), and it has a body segment at (3,3). That's quite a distance from my current position, so it's probably not an immediate threat. However, if I start moving LEFT towards (5,8), I might be heading in the general direction of Snake #0, which could be risky if it decides to move towards me.\n\nOn the other hand, moving DOWN towards (6,5) keeps me on the right side of the board, away from Snake #0. That seems safer and more direct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the apple at (9,9). It's at the top right corner, but moving there would require going RIGHT from my current position, which isn't possible since I'm at (6,8) and moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), which is empty. Plus, (9,9) is quite far, and I have a closer apple at (6,5).\n\nSo, the best move seems to be DOWN to (6,7). From there, I can continue moving DOWN to (6,6), (6,5), and collect the apple. Once I have that, I can look for the next closest apple, which would likely be at (4,5) or (5,0), depending on my position after eating.\n\nI should also think about the potential for growing my snake. If I collect the apple at (6,5), my snake will have a body segment at (6,8), (6,7), and (6,6), assuming I move straight down. That could block me from moving LEFT or RIGHT in the future, but since I'm heading towards the apple, it's worth the risk.\n\nIn summary, moving DOWN to (6,7) is the best option. It gets me closer to the nearest apple and keeps me away from potential threats. After that, I'll continue moving DOWN to collect the apple and then reassess my next move based on the new board state.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move down towards the apple at (6,5).

            "rationale": "<think>Alright, let's break this down. The user is controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. Their snake has its head at (7,8) and no body. There's another snake, Snake #0, at (3,3). The apples are at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (3,4), (4,5). The goal is to collect apples without dying to gain points.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best direction to move. The snake is currently at (7,8). Let's look at the surrounding cells. Up from (7,8) would be (7,9), which is the top wall, so that's invalid. Down is (7,7), which is empty. Left is (6,8), also empty. Right is (8,8), which is empty. So the possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (6,5). That's two to the left and three down from the current position. Another apple is at (5,0), which is further away. There's also an apple at (9,9), which is two to the right and one up, but moving up from (7,8) is into the wall, so that's not possible. The apples at (3,4) and (4,5) are also quite a distance away.\n\nSnake #0 is at (3,3), which is far from the current position, so it's not an immediate threat. The main priority should be to move towards the nearest apple at (6,5). To get there, the snake needs to move left twice and down three times. Alternatively, moving down first might be safer to get closer.\n\nWait, moving left from (7,8) to (6,8) is possible. Then from there, moving down to (6,7), (6,6), and so on towards (6,5). That seems like a good path. Alternatively, moving down first to (7,7) and then left might also work, but moving left first might be better to get closer to the target column.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT to (6,8). Then, in the next moves, continue moving down towards (6,5). This path avoids walls and the enemy snake. It's important to plan ahead to ensure the snake doesn't run into itself or the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering the rules, if the snake moves into an apple, it grows and gains a point. So, the strategy is to collect as many apples as possible without colliding with walls, the enemy, or itself.\n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT to position (6,8). That's the best option to start moving towards the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move towards the nearest apple. I'll head left first to get closer to (6,5).

There are several apples on the board: at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (4,5), and (9,2). There's also another snake, Snake #0, with its head at (3,4) and a body segment at (3,3).\n\nMy last move was LEFT, which took me from (7,8) to (6,8). Now I need to decide where to go next. I want to get to an apple to grow and gain points, but I also need to avoid hitting walls or the other snake.\n\nLooking at my current position at (6,8), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP would take me to (6,9), which is the top wall, so that's not possible. Moving DOWN would take me to (6,7), which is empty. Moving LEFT would take me to (5,8), which is also empty. Moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), but that's where I just came from, and there's nothing there except my previous position, which is now empty.\n\nSo, my options are DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8). I'm trying to get to the apple at (6,5), which is directly below me. Moving DOWN to (6,7) would get me closer to that apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) might take me away from the apple, but it could also position me to move towards other apples.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (5,0), which is far down and to the left. If I go LEFT to (5,8), I could then start moving DOWN towards (5,0). But that seems like a long journey, and I might run into the other snake or walls along the way.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is closer, so it might be better to go DOWN to (6,7) and then continue moving DOWN towards (6,5). That way, I can collect that apple quickly and gain a point before worrying about the others.\n\nBut I also need to keep an eye on Snake #0. Its head is at (3,4), and it has a body segment at (3,3). That's quite a distance from my current position, so it's probably not an immediate threat. However, if I start moving LEFT towards (5,8), I might be heading in the general direction of Snake #0, which could be risky if it decides to move towards me.\n\nOn the other hand, moving DOWN towards (6,5) keeps me on the right side of the board, away from Snake #0. That seems safer and more direct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the apple at (9,9). It's at the top right corner, but moving there would require going RIGHT from my current position, which isn't possible since I'm at (6,8) and moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), which is empty. Plus, (9,9) is quite far, and I have a closer apple at (6,5).\n\nSo, the best move seems to be DOWN to (6,7). From there, I can continue moving DOWN to (6,6), (6,5), and collect the apple. Once I have that, I can look for the next closest apple, which would likely be at (4,5) or (5,0), depending on my position after eating.\n\nI should also think about the potential for growing my snake. If I collect the apple at (6,5), my snake will have a body segment at (6,8), (6,7), and (6,6), assuming I move straight down. That could block me from moving LEFT or RIGHT in the future, but since I'm heading towards the apple, it's worth the risk.\n\nIn summary, moving DOWN to (6,7) is the best option. It gets me closer to the nearest apple and keeps me away from potential threats. After that, I'll continue moving DOWN to collect the apple and then reassess my next move based on the new board state.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move down towards the apple at (6,5).

The goal is to collect apples without dying to gain points.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best direction to move. The snake is currently at (7,8). Let's look at the surrounding cells. Up from (7,8) would be (7,9), which is the top wall, so that's invalid. Down is (7,7), which is empty. Left is (6,8), also empty. Right is (8,8), which is empty. So the possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (6,5). That's two to the left and three down from the current position. Another apple is at (5,0), which is further away. There's also an apple at (9,9), which is two to the right and one up, but moving up from (7,8) is into the wall, so that's not possible. The apples at (3,4) and (4,5) are also quite a distance away.\n\nSnake #0 is at (3,3), which is far from the current position, so it's not an immediate threat. The main priority should be to move towards the nearest apple at (6,5). To get there, the snake needs to move left twice and down three times. Alternatively, moving down first might be safer to get closer.\n\nWait, moving left from (7,8) to (6,8) is possible. Then from there, moving down to (6,7), (6,6), and so on towards (6,5). That seems like a good path. Alternatively, moving down first to (7,7) and then left might also work, but moving left first might be better to get closer to the target column.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT to (6,8). Then, in the next moves, continue moving down towards (6,5). This path avoids walls and the enemy snake. It's important to plan ahead to ensure the snake doesn't run into itself or the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering the rules, if the snake moves into an apple, it grows and gains a point. So, the strategy is to collect as many apples as possible without colliding with walls, the enemy, or itself.\n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT to position (6,8). That's the best option to start moving towards the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move towards the nearest apple. I'll head left first to get closer to (6,5).

There are several apples on the board: at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (4,5), and (9,2). There's also another snake, Snake #0, with its head at (3,4) and a body segment at (3,3).\n\nMy last move was LEFT, which took me from (7,8) to (6,8). Now I need to decide where to go next. I want to get to an apple to grow and gain points, but I also need to avoid hitting walls or the other snake.\n\nLooking at my current position at (6,8), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP would take me to (6,9), which is the top wall, so that's not possible. Moving DOWN would take me to (6,7), which is empty. Moving LEFT would take me to (5,8), which is also empty. Moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), but that's where I just came from, and there's nothing there except my previous position, which is now empty.\n\nSo, my options are DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8). I'm trying to get to the apple at (6,5), which is directly below me. Moving DOWN to (6,7) would get me closer to that apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) might take me away from the apple, but it could also position me to move towards other apples.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (5,0), which is far down and to the left. If I go LEFT to (5,8), I could then start moving DOWN towards (5,0). But that seems like a long journey, and I might run into the other snake or walls along the way.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is closer, so it might be better to go DOWN to (6,7) and then continue moving DOWN towards (6,5). That way, I can collect that apple quickly and gain a point before worrying about the others.\n\nBut I also need to keep an eye on Snake #0. Its head is at (3,4), and it has a body segment at (3,3). That's quite a distance from my current position, so it's probably not an immediate threat. However, if I start moving LEFT towards (5,8), I might be heading in the general direction of Snake #0, which could be risky if it decides to move towards me.\n\nOn the other hand, moving DOWN towards (6,5) keeps me on the right side of the board, away from Snake #0. That seems safer and more direct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the apple at (9,9). It's at the top right corner, but moving there would require going RIGHT from my current position, which isn't possible since I'm at (6,8) and moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), which is empty. Plus, (9,9) is quite far, and I have a closer apple at (6,5).\n\nSo, the best move seems to be DOWN to (6,7). From there, I can continue moving DOWN to (6,6), (6,5), and collect the apple. Once I have that, I can look for the next closest apple, which would likely be at (4,5) or (5,0), depending on my position after eating.\n\nI should also think about the potential for growing my snake. If I collect the apple at (6,5), my snake will have a body segment at (6,8), (6,7), and (6,6), assuming I move straight down. That could block me from moving LEFT or RIGHT in the future, but since I'm heading towards the apple, it's worth the risk.\n\nIn summary, moving DOWN to (6,7) is the best option. It gets me closer to the nearest apple and keeps me away from potential threats. After that, I'll continue moving DOWN to collect the apple and then reassess my next move based on the new board state.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move down towards the apple at (6,5).

            "rationale": "<think>Alright, let's break this down. The user is controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. Their snake has its head at (7,8) and no body. There's another snake, Snake #0, at (3,3). The apples are at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (3,4), (4,5). The goal is to collect apples without dying to gain points.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best direction to move. The snake is currently at (7,8). Let's look at the surrounding cells. Up from (7,8) would be (7,9), which is the top wall, so that's invalid. Down is (7,7), which is empty. Left is (6,8), also empty. Right is (8,8), which is empty. So the possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (6,5). That's two to the left and three down from the current position. Another apple is at (5,0), which is further away. There's also an apple at (9,9), which is two to the right and one up, but moving up from (7,8) is into the wall, so that's not possible. The apples at (3,4) and (4,5) are also quite a distance away.\n\nSnake #0 is at (3,3), which is far from the current position, so it's not an immediate threat. The main priority should be to move towards the nearest apple at (6,5). To get there, the snake needs to move left twice and down three times. Alternatively, moving down first might be safer to get closer.\n\nWait, moving left from (7,8) to (6,8) is possible. Then from there, moving down to (6,7), (6,6), and so on towards (6,5). That seems like a good path. Alternatively, moving down first to (7,7) and then left might also work, but moving left first might be better to get closer to the target column.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT to (6,8). Then, in the next moves, continue moving down towards (6,5). This path avoids walls and the enemy snake. It's important to plan ahead to ensure the snake doesn't run into itself or the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering the rules, if the snake moves into an apple, it grows and gains a point. So, the strategy is to collect as many apples as possible without colliding with walls, the enemy, or itself.\n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT to position (6,8). That's the best option to start moving towards the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move towards the nearest apple. I'll head left first to get closer to (6,5).

There are several apples on the board: at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (4,5), and (9,2). There's also another snake, Snake #0, with its head at (3,4) and a body segment at (3,3).\n\nMy last move was LEFT, which took me from (7,8) to (6,8). Now I need to decide where to go next. I want to get to an apple to grow and gain points, but I also need to avoid hitting walls or the other snake.\n\nLooking at my current position at (6,8), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP would take me to (6,9), which is the top wall, so that's not possible. Moving DOWN would take me to (6,7), which is empty. Moving LEFT would take me to (5,8), which is also empty. Moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), but that's where I just came from, and there's nothing there except my previous position, which is now empty.\n\nSo, my options are DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8). I'm trying to get to the apple at (6,5), which is directly below me. Moving DOWN to (6,7) would get me closer to that apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) might take me away from the apple, but it could also position me to move towards other apples.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (5,0), which is far down and to the left. If I go LEFT to (5,8), I could then start moving DOWN towards (5,0). But that seems like a long journey, and I might run into the other snake or walls along the way.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is closer, so it might be better to go DOWN to (6,7) and then continue moving DOWN towards (6,5). That way, I can collect that apple quickly and gain a point before worrying about the others.\n\nBut I also need to keep an eye on Snake #0. Its head is at (3,4), and it has a body segment at (3,3). That's quite a distance from my current position, so it's probably not an immediate threat. However, if I start moving LEFT towards (5,8), I might be heading in the general direction of Snake #0, which could be risky if it decides to move towards me.\n\nOn the other hand, moving DOWN towards (6,5) keeps me on the right side of the board, away from Snake #0. That seems safer and more direct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the apple at (9,9). It's at the top right corner, but moving there would require going RIGHT from my current position, which isn't possible since I'm at (6,8) and moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), which is empty. Plus, (9,9) is quite far, and I have a closer apple at (6,5).\n\nSo, the best move seems to be DOWN to (6,7). From there, I can continue moving DOWN to (6,6), (6,5), and collect the apple. Once I have that, I can look for the next closest apple, which would likely be at (4,5) or (5,0), depending on my position after eating.\n\nI should also think about the potential for growing my snake. If I collect the apple at (6,5), my snake will have a body segment at (6,8), (6,7), and (6,6), assuming I move straight down. That could block me from moving LEFT or RIGHT in the future, but since I'm heading towards the apple, it's worth the risk.\n\nIn summary, moving DOWN to (6,7) is the best option. It gets me closer to the nearest apple and keeps me away from potential threats. After that, I'll continue moving DOWN to collect the apple and then reassess my next move based on the new board state.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move down towards the apple at (6,5).

There's another snake, Snake #0, at (3,3). The apples are at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (3,4), (4,5). The goal is to collect apples without dying to gain points.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best direction to move. The snake is currently at (7,8). Let's look at the surrounding cells. Up from (7,8) would be (7,9), which is the top wall, so that's invalid. Down is (7,7), which is empty. Left is (6,8), also empty. Right is (8,8), which is empty. So the possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (6,5). That's two to the left and three down from the current position. Another apple is at (5,0), which is further away. There's also an apple at (9,9), which is two to the right and one up, but moving up from (7,8) is into the wall, so that's not possible. The apples at (3,4) and (4,5) are also quite a distance away.\n\nSnake #0 is at (3,3), which is far from the current position, so it's not an immediate threat. The main priority should be to move towards the nearest apple at (6,5). To get there, the snake needs to move left twice and down three times. Alternatively, moving down first might be safer to get closer.\n\nWait, moving left from (7,8) to (6,8) is possible. Then from there, moving down to (6,7), (6,6), and so on towards (6,5). That seems like a good path. Alternatively, moving down first to (7,7) and then left might also work, but moving left first might be better to get closer to the target column.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT to (6,8). Then, in the next moves, continue moving down towards (6,5). This path avoids walls and the enemy snake. It's important to plan ahead to ensure the snake doesn't run into itself or the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering the rules, if the snake moves into an apple, it grows and gains a point. So, the strategy is to collect as many apples as possible without colliding with walls, the enemy, or itself.\n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT to position (6,8). That's the best option to start moving towards the nearest apple.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move towards the nearest apple. I'll head left first to get closer to (6,5).

There are several apples on the board: at (6,5), (5,0), (9,9), (4,5), and (9,2). There's also another snake, Snake #0, with its head at (3,4) and a body segment at (3,3).\n\nMy last move was LEFT, which took me from (7,8) to (6,8). Now I need to decide where to go next. I want to get to an apple to grow and gain points, but I also need to avoid hitting walls or the other snake.\n\nLooking at my current position at (6,8), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP would take me to (6,9), which is the top wall, so that's not possible. Moving DOWN would take me to (6,7), which is empty. Moving LEFT would take me to (5,8), which is also empty. Moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), but that's where I just came from, and there's nothing there except my previous position, which is now empty.\n\nSo, my options are DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8). I'm trying to get to the apple at (6,5), which is directly below me. Moving DOWN to (6,7) would get me closer to that apple. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) might take me away from the apple, but it could also position me to move towards other apples.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (5,0), which is far down and to the left. If I go LEFT to (5,8), I could then start moving DOWN towards (5,0). But that seems like a long journey, and I might run into the other snake or walls along the way.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is closer, so it might be better to go DOWN to (6,7) and then continue moving DOWN towards (6,5). That way, I can collect that apple quickly and gain a point before worrying about the others.\n\nBut I also need to keep an eye on Snake #0. Its head is at (3,4), and it has a body segment at (3,3). That's quite a distance from my current position, so it's probably not an immediate threat. However, if I start moving LEFT towards (5,8), I might be heading in the general direction of Snake #0, which could be risky if it decides to move towards me.\n\nOn the other hand, moving DOWN towards (6,5) keeps me on the right side of the board, away from Snake #0. That seems safer and more direct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the apple at (9,9). It's at the top right corner, but moving there would require going RIGHT from my current position, which isn't possible since I'm at (6,8) and moving RIGHT would take me to (7,8), which is empty. Plus, (9,9) is quite far, and I have a closer apple at (6,5).\n\nSo, the best move seems to be DOWN to (6,7). From there, I can continue moving DOWN to (6,6), (6,5), and collect the apple. Once I have that, I can look for the next closest apple, which would likely be at (4,5) or (5,0), depending on my position after eating.\n\nI should also think about the potential for growing my snake. If I collect the apple at (6,5), my snake will have a body segment at (6,8), (6,7), and (6,6), assuming I move straight down. That could block me from moving LEFT or RIGHT in the future, but since I'm heading towards the apple, it's worth the risk.\n\nIn summary, moving DOWN to (6,7) is the best option. It gets me closer to the nearest apple and keeps me away from potential threats. After that, I'll continue moving DOWN to collect the apple and then reassess my next move based on the new board state.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's move down towards the apple at (6,5).

Its body is at (4,6) and (4,5). If I move left, I might get closer to it, which could be risky. Moving right would take me away from both the enemy and the apples, so that's probably not ideal. Moving up would take me towards the enemy's body at (4,5), which is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, moving down towards (6,0) seems safest and most beneficial. It allows me to grow by eating the apple and also moves me away from the enemy. I should continue this path unless something changes.\n\nSo, the next move should be DOWN to (6,3). From there, I can continue moving down to (6,2) and then (6,1) to reach the apple at (6,0). I'll need to make sure the path is clear and adjust if the enemy moves towards me.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, my snake is at (6,4), and the nearest apple is directly below at (6,0). Moving down towards it is the best option. I'll head down to (6,3) next, continuing towards the apple. I need to avoid the enemy snake, which is to the left, so staying on this path keeps me safe. I'll keep moving down each turn until I reach the apple.\n\nDOWN",
