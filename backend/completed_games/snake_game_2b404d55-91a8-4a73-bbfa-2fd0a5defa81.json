The enemy snake is at (0, 9) with its body at (0, 8) and (0, 7), so it's not a direct threat to me right now.\n3. To score more points, I should try to reach the apples. The closest apple is at (0, 6), so I should move in that direction.\n4. To reach the apple at (0, 6), I should move LEFT to (5, 4).\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to continue moving towards the other apples on the board, while avoiding the walls and the enemy snake.\n\nMy next move is: LEFT."

However, I should still be cautious of Snake #1's movements and adjust my path accordingly if needed. I should also keep an eye on the other apples and consider collecting them for more points.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (7, 4) while keeping a safe distance from Snake #1. If Snake #1 changes direction and moves towards me, I will adjust my path to avoid it. I will also keep an eye on the other apples and adjust my path to collect them if possible.\n\nNext move: UP."
