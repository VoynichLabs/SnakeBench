This is a comparable distance but requires one change of direction.\n\nSince the enemy snake is far away (top-middle of the board), I don't need to worry about it for now.\n\n## Decision\nI'll continue moving DOWN to reach the apple at (9, 0). This is the most direct path to score a point.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (9, 3), continue moving DOWN to reach the apple at (9, 0), then consider moving LEFT to pursue other apples.\n\nDOWN"
