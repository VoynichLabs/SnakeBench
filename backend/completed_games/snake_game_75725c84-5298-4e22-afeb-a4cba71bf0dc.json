It moves me toward the center of the board where I have more apples (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 3).\n2. It keeps my options open and gives me flexibility.\n3. It begins to create distance from my body, which is currently concentrated in the top-left.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT, I should evaluate whether to continue eastward toward the apples at (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 3), or to move DOWN toward (2, 3).
