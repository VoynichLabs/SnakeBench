A . 1 A\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . .\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . .\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . .\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . .\n```\n- Snake #1 (you) is at (7, 4)\n- Snake #0 (enemy) is at (4, 5)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Eliminate Immediate Death Moves\n- **UP**: (7, 4) -> (6, 4) \u2192 Safe (no collision, no off-board)\n- **DOWN**: (7, 4) -> (8, 4) \u2192 Safe\n- **LEFT**: (7, 4) -> (6, 4) \u2192 Same as UP (no collision)\n- **RIGHT**: (7, 4) -> (8, 4) \u2192 Same as DOWN (no collision)\n\nAll four directions are safe from immediate death.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves for Apple Eating and Future Safety\n#### Apple Proximity:\n- Closest apple is at (5, 4). Distance from current head (7, 4) is 2 steps horizontally (left).\n- Other apples are farther away.\n\n#### Snake Movement:\n- Enemy snake is at (4, 5). It can move in any direction, but we need to assume it will try to avoid us if possible.\n- If we move LEFT to (6, 4), the enemy could move RIGHT to (5, 5) and collide with our new head at (6, 4) if we don't account for it. But since we are the first to move, the enemy will move after us, so we need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\n#### Safe Follow-Up Moves:\n- If we move LEFT to (6, 4), we can continue LEFT to (5, 4) next turn and eat the apple.\n- If we move RIGHT to (8, 4), we can continue RIGHT to (9, 4) next turn and eat the apple.\n- If we move UP to (6, 4), we can continue UP to (5, 4) next turn and eat the apple.\n- If we move DOWN to (8, 4), we can continue DOWN to (9, 4) next turn and eat the apple.\n\n#### Enemy's Possible Moves:\n- Enemy is at (4, 5). If we move LEFT to (6, 4), the enemy could move RIGHT to (5, 5) and then we might collide if we don't plan carefully. However, if we move LEFT, the enemy might not be able to reach us immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Long-Term Strategy\n- **Move LEFT to (6, 4)**:\n  - Next turn, we can move LEFT to (5, 4) and eat the apple.\n  - This will grow our snake and increase our score.\n  - The enemy is at (4, 5), so moving LEFT keeps us away from the enemy's direct path.\n\n- **Move RIGHT to (8, 4)**:\n  - Next turn, we can move RIGHT to (9, 4) and eat the apple.\n  - This is also a good option but might leave us in a more exposed position.\n\n- **Move UP to (6, 4)**:\n  - Next turn, we can move UP to (5, 4) and eat the apple.\n  - This is also a good option but might be less optimal if the enemy moves up.\n\n- **Move DOWN to (8, 4)**:\n  - Next turn, we can move DOWN to (9, 4) and eat the apple.\n  - This is also a good option but might be less optimal if the enemy moves down.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\nMoving LEFT to (6, 4) is the best choice because it allows us to eat the closest apple (5, 4) in the next turn, increasing our score and growing our snake. This also keeps us in a safer position relative to the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**\n- Continue moving LEFT to (5, 4) next turn and eat the apple.\n- After eating the apple, continue moving LEFT to (4, 4) and (3, 4) to avoid the enemy and keep growing.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",
