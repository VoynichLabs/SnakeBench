Possible moves:\n   - Up: (6,8) \u2192 safe.\n   - Down: (7,9) \u2192 safe.\n   - Left: (5,9) \u2192 safe.\n   - Right: (7,9) \u2192 safe (but enemy is at (8,7), not directly adjacent to (7,9)).\n   - Wait, no: enemy is at (8,7). Your possible moves are:\n     - Up: (6,8) \u2192 safe.\n     - Down: (7,9) \u2192 safe.\n     - Left: (5,9) \u2192 safe.\n     - Right: (7,9) \u2192 safe.\n   - Enemy will move to (8,8) if it moves right (since it has no body). So no immediate collision.\n\n### Apple Proximity\n- Closest apples are (3,2) and (4,2). Distance from (6,9):\n  - (3,2): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=7 \u2192 Manhattan distance = 10.\n  - (4,2): \u0394x=2, \u0394y=7 \u2192 Manhattan distance = 9.\n- Next closest: (4,8) and (9,8) are farther away.\n\n### Move Evaluation\n1. **Up**: (6,8). Distance to (4,2) becomes 10+1=11, (3,2) becomes 11. Not ideal.\n2. **Down**: (7,9). Distance to (4,2) becomes 9+1=10, (3,2) becomes 10. Still not ideal.\n3. **Left**: (5,9). Distance to (4,2) becomes 8+1=9, (3,2) becomes 8. Better than up/down.\n4. **Right**: (7,9). Same as down.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy\n- Left is the best immediate move to reduce distance to (4,2) and (3,2).\n- Avoiding enemy movement: Enemy is at (8,7). If it moves right to (8,8), it won't interfere with your left move.\n- No immediate danger, so prioritize apple proximity.\n\n### Final Decision\n**LEFT**",

If enemy moves up/down, consider vertical moves (up/down) to avoid overlap.\n- **Turn 3:** If apples are still far, consider expanding horizontally (left/right) to create space for future growth.\n- **Turn 4+:** Monitor enemy movement patterns.
