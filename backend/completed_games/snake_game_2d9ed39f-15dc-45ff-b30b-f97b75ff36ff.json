Moving left positions me closer to the left-y edge, but not closer to any apple (unless we want to loop up the left side).\n\n- **DOWN (2, 0):**\n    - Safe, empty. This moves me toward the bottom wall, but if I stay too low, I'll run into walls. However, it's a safe move.\n    - Possibly a preparatory move if I want to swing around my tail and then head UP the board later.\n\n- **RIGHT (3, 1):**\n    - Safe, empty. This opens a straight path rightward toward the (8, 1) apple (since nothing is blocking in that row until the apple at (8, 1)).\n    - Also works toward the (7, 2) apple: I could eventually go up to row 2 and get the (7, 2) apple.\n\n**Which is optimal for apples?**\n- If I begin moving RIGHT, I can, in future moves:\n    - Continue right all the way to (8, 1) for an apple.\n    - At (7, 1), go UP to (7, 2) for an apple.\n\nI would want to maximize flexibility and minimize risk of hitting myself or getting boxed in.\n\n**Enemy Snake:**\n- Snake #0 is up at (2, 6)/(3, 6). Far from apples I'm currently targeting (no threat).\n\n**Summary of options:**\n- UP: hits my own tail (unsafe)\n- DOWN: safe, but leads to bottom edge quickly without new apples nearby\n- LEFT: safe, but doesn't move toward apples\n- RIGHT: safe, moves toward two apples\n\n**No threat of immediate collision. Should set up for either (8, 1) or (7, 2).**\n\n**Decision:**  \nMove **RIGHT** to (3, 1). This positions me to head for (8, 1) and/or (7, 2). I can then adjust direction based on the timing and enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \n- Re-evaluate which apple is quickest and safest \u2014 keep an eye on enemy movement.\n- Try to avoid cornering myself \u2014 leave escape options.\n\n**Decided move:**  \n**RIGHT**"

Reduces distance.\n- RIGHT to (4, 5): Distance to (2, 6) is |4-2| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3. Increases distance.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT moves reduce the distance to the closest apple (2, 6) to 1.\nLet's consider the position after each move:\n- Move UP to (3, 6): From here, I can move LEFT to reach (2, 6) next turn.\n- Move LEFT to (2, 5): From here, I can move UP to reach (2, 6) next turn.\n\nBoth moves are equally effective for reaching the *closest* apple in two turns.

Current Situation Recap:**  \n- My snake head is at (5, 1), body at (4, 1).\n- Last move: RIGHT.\n- Apples: (7, 2), (5, 6), (4, 8), (8, 1), (4, 6)\n- Enemy snake is far away (upper left at (3, 8)).\n\n**2. Immediate Neighbor Check from (5, 1):**  \n- UP (5, 2): Empty  \n- DOWN (5, 0): Empty  \n- LEFT (4, 1): My own tail. UNLESS I just ate an apple (I didn\u2019t last turn), the tail moves, so it\u2019s EMPTY after the head advances.  \n- RIGHT (6, 1): Empty  \n\n**3. Apple Proximity:**  \nCalculate Manhattan distances from current head (5, 1):\n\n- (8, 1): 3 right. Direct shot.\n- (7, 2): 2 right, 1 up. 3 total.\n- (5, 6): 5 up. 5 total.\n- (4, 8): 1 left, 7 up. 8 total.\n- (4, 6): 1 left, 5 up. 6 total.\n\n**So, (8, 1) is closest (just 3 RIGHT)**; (7, 2) is similar, could go UP/RIGHT as an alternate.\n\n**4. Safe Move Analysis:**  \n- RIGHT (6, 1): Safe and continues direct path toward (8, 1).  \n- UP (5, 2): Safe and allows for pivoting toward (7, 2) or (5, 6).\n- LEFT (4, 1): Just vacated; my tail just left, so should be safe UNLESS I grow (in which case tail doesn't move\u2014NO apple eaten, so safe).\n- DOWN (5, 0): Empty, but wall is at y=0\u2014no strategic reason to be there.\n\n**5. Threat Assessment:**  \n- Enemy is far!\n- No body in immediate vicinity except my own (just left behind me, safe).\n\n**6. Strategic Review:**  \n- The most optimal is to keep heading toward (8, 1) as fast as possible for guaranteed growth.\n- If (8, 1) apple vanishes, can reevaluate, but currently, RIGHT is fastest and safest.\n- UP would give more flexibility, but adds a turn/distance to reach the easiest apple.\n- LEFT or DOWN offers nothing here.\n\n**7. Confirm Move:**  \n- RIGHT remains the clear best option, moving toward the closest apple with a wide open path.\n\n**STRATEGY for Next Turn:**  \n- After (6, 1), continue evaluating path toward (8, 1).\n- If enemy or obstacle appears on the right or (8, 1) is gone, consider pivoting up toward apples at (7, 2) or (5, 6).\n- Avoid getting too close to the bottom or side walls unnecessarily.\n\n**DECIDED MOVE:**  \nRIGHT"

Moves away.\n- DOWN to (3, 7): Distance to (4, 8) is |3-4| + |7-8| = 1 + 1 = 2. Moves away. (Note: Moving DOWN to (3,7) seems safe now but could trap me next turn as (3,8) and (2,7) would become body segments. I need to check if I can reach an apple from there).\n- RIGHT to (4, 8): Distance to (4, 8) is |4-4| + |8-8| = 0 + 0 = 0. Moves directly onto the apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 8) is the optimal safe move as it reaches the closest apple in one step. This move results in eating the apple.\n\nLet's briefly consider the DOWN move and potential trap. If I move DOWN to (3,7), my body becomes [(3,8), (2,8)]. Next turn, my head is at (3,7). Possible moves are (3,8) (body), (2,7), (4,7). My old tail (2,7) might be free if I grew, but if not, I cannot move to (2,7). So, (3,8) is body, (2,7) might be body. I would only have (4,7) potentially open. This looks risky. Moving RIGHT is clearly better as it guarantees eating an apple and growth, avoiding the trap scenario of moving DOWN.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (4, 8), my head will be at (4, 8) and my body will be at [(3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7)]. I will have eaten an apple. I will then re-evaluate the board state and my position. The apple at (4, 6) is now very close, just 2 steps away. I should target that apple if it is safe to do so.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Moving left positions me closer to the left-y edge, but not closer to any apple (unless we want to loop up the left side).\n\n- **DOWN (2, 0):**\n    - Safe, empty. This moves me toward the bottom wall, but if I stay too low, I'll run into walls. However, it's a safe move.\n    - Possibly a preparatory move if I want to swing around my tail and then head UP the board later.\n\n- **RIGHT (3, 1):**\n    - Safe, empty. This opens a straight path rightward toward the (8, 1) apple (since nothing is blocking in that row until the apple at (8, 1)).\n    - Also works toward the (7, 2) apple: I could eventually go up to row 2 and get the (7, 2) apple.\n\n**Which is optimal for apples?**\n- If I begin moving RIGHT, I can, in future moves:\n    - Continue right all the way to (8, 1) for an apple.\n    - At (7, 1), go UP to (7, 2) for an apple.\n\nI would want to maximize flexibility and minimize risk of hitting myself or getting boxed in.\n\n**Enemy Snake:**\n- Snake #0 is up at (2, 6)/(3, 6). Far from apples I'm currently targeting (no threat).\n\n**Summary of options:**\n- UP: hits my own tail (unsafe)\n- DOWN: safe, but leads to bottom edge quickly without new apples nearby\n- LEFT: safe, but doesn't move toward apples\n- RIGHT: safe, moves toward two apples\n\n**No threat of immediate collision. Should set up for either (8, 1) or (7, 2).**\n\n**Decision:**  \nMove **RIGHT** to (3, 1). This positions me to head for (8, 1) and/or (7, 2). I can then adjust direction based on the timing and enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \n- Re-evaluate which apple is quickest and safest \u2014 keep an eye on enemy movement.\n- Try to avoid cornering myself \u2014 leave escape options.\n\n**Decided move:**  \n**RIGHT**"

Moves away or stays same distance depending on how you view the diagonal move relative to axis-aligned movement.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4, 7) is the safe move that brings me closest to the nearest apple at (4, 6).

Possible moves are (3,8) (body), (2,7), (4,7). My old tail (2,7) might be free if I grew, but if not, I cannot move to (2,7). So, (3,8) is body, (2,7) might be body. I would only have (4,7) potentially open. This looks risky. Moving RIGHT is clearly better as it guarantees eating an apple and growth, avoiding the trap scenario of moving DOWN.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (4, 8), my head will be at (4, 8) and my body will be at [(3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7)]. I will have eaten an apple. I will then re-evaluate the board state and my position. The apple at (4, 6) is now very close, just 2 steps away.

(Further away)\n- Move DOWN to (5, 5): Distance to (3, 4) from (5, 5) is |5-3| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Closer)\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 6): Distance to (3, 4) from (6, 6) is |6-3| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5. (Further away)\n\nMoving DOWN to (5, 5) is the only safe move that brings me closer to the nearest apple. It is also a move away from my longer body segment to the north.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (5, 5). My body will be [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)]. I will reassess the board, looking for the safest moves that lead towards the nearest apple, while being mindful of the enemy snake's position and potential traps created by my own body.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Reduces distance.\n- RIGHT to (4, 5): Distance to (2, 6) is |4-2| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3. Increases distance.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT moves reduce the distance to the closest apple (2, 6) to 1.\nLet's consider the position after each move:\n- Move UP to (3, 6): From here, I can move LEFT to reach (2, 6) next turn.\n- Move LEFT to (2, 5): From here, I can move UP to reach (2, 6) next turn.\n\nBoth moves are equally effective for reaching the *closest* apple in two turns.

UNLESS I just ate an apple (I didn\u2019t last turn), the tail moves, so it\u2019s EMPTY after the head advances.  \n- RIGHT (6, 1): Empty  \n\n**3.

Threat Assessment:**  \n- Enemy is far!\n- No body in immediate vicinity except my own (just left behind me, safe).\n\n**6. Strategic Review:**  \n- The most optimal is to keep heading toward (8, 1) as fast as possible for guaranteed growth.\n- If (8, 1) apple vanishes, can reevaluate, but currently, RIGHT is fastest and safest.\n- UP would give more flexibility, but adds a turn/distance to reach the easiest apple.\n- LEFT or DOWN offers nothing here.\n\n**7. Confirm Move:**  \n- RIGHT remains the clear best option, moving toward the closest apple with a wide open path.\n\n**STRATEGY for Next Turn:**  \n- After (6, 1), continue evaluating path toward (8, 1).\n- If enemy or obstacle appears on the right or (8, 1) is gone, consider pivoting up toward apples at (7, 2) or (5, 6).\n- Avoid getting too close to the bottom or side walls unnecessarily.\n\n**DECIDED MOVE:**  \nRIGHT"

Moves directly onto the apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 8) is the optimal safe move as it reaches the closest apple in one step. This move results in eating the apple.\n\nLet's briefly consider the DOWN move and potential trap. If I move DOWN to (3,7), my body becomes [(3,8), (2,8)]. Next turn, my head is at (3,7). Possible moves are (3,8) (body), (2,7), (4,7). My old tail (2,7) might be free if I grew, but if not, I cannot move to (2,7). So, (3,8) is body, (2,7) might be body. I would only have (4,7) potentially open. This looks risky. Moving RIGHT is clearly better as it guarantees eating an apple and growth, avoiding the trap scenario of moving DOWN.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (4, 8), my head will be at (4, 8) and my body will be at [(3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7)]. I will have eaten an apple. I will then re-evaluate the board state and my position. The apple at (4, 6) is now very close, just 2 steps away. I should target that apple if it is safe to do so.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

No.\n- LEFT to (3, 6): Is there an apple at (3, 6)? No.\n- RIGHT to (5, 6): Is there an apple at (5, 6)? Yes.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 6) is a safe move that lands me directly on an apple. This is the optimal move for this turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (5, 6), I will eat the apple and grow. My head will be at (5, 6), and my body will be [(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)]. I will then evaluate the new board state, considering the remaining apples and the positions of other snakes, and choose the next safe move, ideally towards another apple or towards open space to avoid getting trapped.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

No need to rush into kill-avoidance.\n\n### Comparing:\n- **UP** maintains flexibility, gets closer to apples in (3,4) and (1,3).\n- **LEFT** also safe, but immediate reward is less unless aiming at (4,0) in a few moves.\n- **Staying on row 2** (with LEFT) can \u201cwait\u201d until my tail vacates (7,1), opening up a path toward the lower apple later.\n\nBut: **UP** is the most flexible right now and avoids boxing into sides.

(empty)              | Yes           | No             |\n| RIGHT  | (8,2)   | My own body            | No            | No             |\n\n**Let's check DOWN (7,1) more carefully:**  \n- Because I *ate an apple this turn*, my tail will **not** vacate its spot (7,1) yet.  \n- So, moving DOWN to (7,1) is a collision with myself.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Move Analysis**\n\n- **UP to (7,3):**\n    - Safe and empty, keeps me flexible; could move toward apples at (3,4) or (1,3).\n- **LEFT to (6,2):**\n    - Safe, empty. Not directly toward apple, but keeps board open.\n- **RIGHT to (8,2):**\n    - Collides with own body\u2019s neck. Not allowed.\n- **DOWN to (7,1):**\n    - Collides with my own (not-yet-moving) tail. Not allowed.\n\nSo, actual SAFE moves: UP or LEFT.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Strategic Apple Targeting**\n\n- **Immediate apples:**  \n    - (7,0): at (7,0) **two spaces below**, but blocked this turn by my own tail (I cannot go DOWN safely yet).\n    - (9,0): towards right, but would need to reroute (can\u2019t go right either).\n- **Apples further afield:**  \n    - (3,4), (1,3): UP toward (7,3) at least brings me closer toward the left-top apples, or opens up possibilities.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Best Path Forward**\n\n### Option A: UP  \n- Go up to (7,3), completely safe.\n- Opens route towards (3,4), (1,3) apples (UP/LEFT after).\n\n### Option B: LEFT  \n- Go to (6,2), safe.\n- Could then plan a path toward (4,0) (left and down), or position for later.\n\n### Additional Consideration:\n- Can\u2019t get (7,0) until my tail vacates (7,1)\u2014needs a move for that.\n- Enemy snake is far away. No need to rush into kill-avoidance.\n\n### Comparing:\n- **UP** maintains flexibility, gets closer to apples in (3,4) and (1,3).\n- **LEFT** also safe, but immediate reward is less unless aiming at (4,0) in a few moves.\n- **Staying on row 2** (with LEFT) can \u201cwait\u201d until my tail vacates (7,1), opening up a path toward the lower apple later.\n\nBut: **UP** is the most flexible right now and avoids boxing into sides. It also opens up options for future moves to either side, or to later circle back to (7,0) once my tail vacates (after next turn).\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Short-Term Plan**\n\n- Move UP to (7,3).\n- On next turn, evaluate if I can go further UP/LEFT toward (3,4), or if the tail at (7,1) has moved, allowing a route DOWN to the (7,0) apple.\n\n---\n\n## DECIDED MOVE:\n\n**UP**\n\n---\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Turn\n\n- After going UP, consider LEFT (if safe) or further UP; watch for when the tail at (7,1) leaves, which would allow me to drop down for (7,0) apple.\n- Avoid moving into enemy snake territory unnecessarily.\n- Keep multiple escape options open as snake grows."
