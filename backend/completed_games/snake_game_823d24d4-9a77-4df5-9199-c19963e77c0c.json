If you move left, you will eat the apple at (5, 3) and grow by 1 segment.\n  - After eating, your body will be [(5, 3), (6, 3)].\n  - Enemy snake is at (7, 3), so no immediate collision.\n  - Check if the enemy moves: Enemy snake is at (7, 3), and if it moves left to (6, 3), it will collide with your tail (6, 3) and die. This is a good outcome.\n  - Check if the enemy moves right to (8, 3): no immediate collision with you.\n  - Check if the enemy moves up/down: no immediate collision with you.\n  - So, moving left is safe and will eat an apple.\n\n- **Up (to (6, 4)):**\n  - No apple nearby.\n  - Check if (6, 4) is safe: no immediate collision with enemy or own body.\n  - Enemy snake could move to (6, 4) and collide with you, but since enemy is at (7, 3), it's unlikely to move to (6, 4) unless it has a body segment, which it doesn't.\n  - However, if enemy moves up to (7, 4), no immediate collision with you.\n  - This move is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n\n- **Down (to (6, 2)):**\n  - No apple nearby.\n  - Check if (6, 2) is safe: no immediate collision with enemy or own body.\n  - Enemy snake could move to (6, 2) and collide with you, but unlikely unless it has a body segment.\n  - This move is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n\n- **Right (to (7, 3)):**\n  - This is the enemy snake's head! Collision guaranteed, so this move is invalid.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\n- **Immediate Goal:** Eat the apple at (5, 3) to grow and gain points.\n- **Next Steps:**\n  - After eating (5, 3), your body will be [(5, 3), (6, 3)].\n  - Enemy snake will die if it moves left to (6, 3) (since your tail is at (6, 3)).\n  - You should then try to move towards the next apple at (6, 5) or (0, 2) or (0, 3).\n  - Avoid getting trapped between the enemy's potential moves and your own body.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe best immediate move is to **LEFT** to eat the apple at (5, 3) and grow safely.\n\n**LEFT**",

Avoid straight-line paths that could trap the tail.\n  - **Enemy Threat Mitigation:** Since Snake #0 is new and has no body, assume it will move aggressively (e.g., toward your tail). Avoid moves that create a straight-line path to its head (e.g., moving UP from (3,6) could expose your tail to a direct collision if it moves UP).\n  - **Apple Prioritization:** (0,2)/(0,3) are closer than (6,5), but (6,5) is a high-value target if blocked. If leftward progress stalls, pivot toward the top-right (e.g., UP or RIGHT) to explore the (6,5) apple.\n  - **Body Management:** Keep the tail at least 1 cell away from the head in the x-direction to avoid immediate collisions. If the tail is at (4,5) and you move LEFT to (3,6), the next move should avoid moving DOWN to (3,5) (which would collide with tail at (4,5) if you pivot later).\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Turns 6\u201310):**\n- **Turn 6:** LEFT to (3,6) (as chosen). Tail at (4,5). Open path to (2,6) or (3,5) next turn.\n- **Turn 7:** If no enemy threat, move LEFT to (2,6). If enemy moves aggressively (e.g., UP to (8,6)), pivot UP to (3,7) to avoid collision.\n- **Turn 8:** Explore (0,2)/(0,3) by moving DOWN to (2,5) or RIGHT to (3,5). If tail is at (4,5), moving DOWN is invalid (collision). Instead, move RIGHT to (3,5) to approach the left edge.\n- **Turn 9:** If tail is at (3,5), move LEFT to (2,5) or UP to (3,6). Prioritize LEFT to reduce x-coordinate further.\n- **Turn 10:** If (0,2) is reachable (e.g., via (2,5) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,3)), attempt to eat it. Otherwise, pivot toward (6,5) via UP or RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Watch:** Monitor Snake #0\u2019s head position. If it moves toward your tail (e.g., from (8,5) to (7,5)), avoid moving LEFT if it could block your path. Instead, pivot UP or RIGHT to create space.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move:**\n**UP**",

Tail at (4,5). Enemy #0 is aggressive (head at (6,5), body at [(7,5)]).\n- **Key Risks:**\n  - Moving LEFT from (3,7) to (3,6) is safe (no collision), but the next move must avoid exposing the tail to Snake #0\u2019s potential aggression.\n  - If Snake #0 moves UP to (8,5) or LEFT to (6,4), it could block your path to the left edge. Avoid moves that create a straight-line path to its head (e.g., moving DOWN from (3,6) to (3,5) could trap the tail if it pivots toward you).\n- **Apple Prioritization:**\n  - (0,2) and (0,3) are the closest and most critical. If we can reach them by Turn 10, we should prioritize them over (6,5), which is farther and may require longer detours.\n  - If leftward progress stalls, pivot toward (6,5) via UP or RIGHT to explore high-value targets.\n- **Body Management:**\n  - Maintain at least 1 cell separation in the x-direction between head and tail to avoid immediate collisions. If the tail is at (4,5), moving LEFT to (3,6) is safe, but the next move should avoid moving DOWN to (3,5) (which could collide with tail at (4,5) if Snake #0 pivots).\n- **Enemy Watch:**\n  - Snake #0\u2019s head is at (6,5), body at (7,5). It is likely to move toward the left edge or your tail. Avoid moves that create a straight-line path to its head (e.g., moving UP from (3,6) to (3,7) could expose your tail to a collision if it moves UP to (8,6)).\n  - If Snake #0 moves UP to (8,6), pivot UP to (3,8) to avoid collision and explore the top-right.\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Turn 7):**\n- **Move:** UP to (3,8). This avoids exposing the tail to Snake #0\u2019s potential aggression and opens a path to explore the top-right corner, including the (6,5) apple.\n- **Rationale:** Moving UP from (3,7) to (3,8) is safe and does not create a straight-line path to Snake #0\u2019s head. It also keeps the tail at (4,5) out of immediate danger and allows for future exploration of the (6,5) apple if leftward progress stalls.\n\n---\n\n### Final Move:\n**UP**",

Tail at (0, 7) is safe from Snake #0\u2019s head at (3, 2).\n     - **Cons:** Snake #0\u2019s head is at (3, 2), which is adjacent to your tail at (0, 7). If Snake #0 moves UP/DOWN, it could threaten your tail. However, Snake #0\u2019s next move is likely to prioritize its apple at (6, 5), so this risk is low.\n   - **Verdict:** Safe and efficient toward leftward apples.\n\n3. **LEFT to (-1, 8):**\n   - **Off-board (x=-1 is invalid)** \u2192 **DEADLINE**.\n   - *Eliminate.*\n\n4. **RIGHT to (1, 8):**\n   - **Safe:** No collision.\n   - **Follow-up options:**\n     - Next move could be UP to (1, 7) or DOWN to (1, 9) (invalid).\n     - **Pros:** Keeps tail at (0, 7) safe from Snake #0\u2019s head at (3, 2). Avoids immediate threats.\n     - **Cons:** Slower progress toward leftward apples. Tail at (0, 7) is adjacent to Snake #0\u2019s body at (4, 2) and (5, 2). While no immediate collision, Snake #0 could move UP/DOWN to threaten your tail in future turns.\n   - **Verdict:** Safer for the moment but less optimal for apple proximity.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat Analysis**\n- Snake #0\u2019s head is at (3, 2), and its body extends to (5, 2). Your tail is at (0, 7), which is safe from Snake #0\u2019s current position but could be threatened if Snake #0 moves UP or DOWN.\n- Snake #0\u2019s next move is likely to prioritize its apple at (6, 5), so its immediate threat to you is low. However, if Snake #0 moves LEFT to (2, 2) or RIGHT to (6, 2), it could pose a risk to your tail.\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Proximity and Strategy**\n- The leftward apples (0, 2) and (0, 3) are the most critical. Moving DOWN to (1, 8) allows you to progress directly leftward toward them.\n- Moving RIGHT to (1, 8) is safer but less efficient. It also risks your tail being adjacent to Snake #0\u2019s body in future turns.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan for Turns 14\u201320**\n**Phase 1 (Turns 13\u201320):**\n- **Primary Goal:** Reach the leftward apples (0, 2) and (0, 3) by Turn 20.\n- **Short-Term Strategy:**\n  - **Turn 13:** Move DOWN to (1, 8). This allows direct leftward progress toward (0, 2) or (0, 3) while keeping the tail safe from Snake #0\u2019s immediate threats.\n  - **Turn 14:** Move LEFT to (1, 7). This reduces the distance to (0, 2) or (0, 3) by 1 step.\n  - **Turn 15:** Move LEFT to (1, 6). Continue reducing distance to the leftward apples.\n  - **Turn 16:** Move LEFT to (1, 5). If Snake #0 doesn\u2019t interfere, this should be safe.\n  - **Turn 17:** Move LEFT to (1, 4). If no immediate threats, this is a critical step toward (0, 4).\n  - **Turn 18:** Move LEFT to (1, 3). If Snake #0 hasn\u2019t moved to block, this is a safe move.\n  - **Turn 19:** Move LEFT to (1, 2). This is the final step before reaching (0, 2) or (0, 3).\n  - **Turn 20:** Move LEFT to (0, 2) or (0, 3) to eat the apple and grow.\n\n- **Enemy Mitigation:**\n  - Snake #0\u2019s head is at (3, 2), so if it moves UP or DOWN, it could threaten your tail. However, since Snake #0\u2019s primary goal is its apple at (6, 5), it is unlikely to move aggressively toward you unless it\u2019s forced.\n  - If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (2, 2), it could block your path. In that case, pivot toward the top-right corner (e.g., move RIGHT to (2, 8) and then UP/DOWN to avoid Snake #0).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nBased on the analysis, moving **DOWN** to (1, 8) is the optimal choice for Turn 13. It allows direct progress toward the leftward apples while keeping the tail safe from immediate threats.\n\nDOWN",

This suggests the snake grew after eating (0,4) and then moved DOWN to (1,8), but the body is now [(0,7)], meaning the snake must have moved LEFT from (1,8) to (0,8) and then DOWN to (1,8) again, which is impossible. There seems to be a discrepancy in the state description. Assuming the snake is at head (0,6), body [(0,7)], and last move was DOWN from (0,7) to (0,8), but the head is now (0,6), which contradicts. Likely, the snake ate (0,4) on Turn 14, grew to [(0,7), (0,8)], then moved DOWN to (1,8), and the body is now [(0,7)]. This implies the snake is at head (1,8), body [(0,7)], but the state says head (0,6). This is inconsistent. I\u2019ll assume the snake is at head (0,6), body [(0,7)], and the last move was DOWN from (0,7) to (0,8), but the head is now (0,6), which is impossible unless the snake reversed direction. I\u2019ll proceed with the given state: head (0,6), body [(0,7)].\n\n**Apples Left:**\n- (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) eaten, (6,8), (1,6) remaining.\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (1,2)\n- Body: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n- Apples: 3 (eaten at (6,5) on Turn 14? Or other apples? The state says Snake #0 has 3 apples, but the apples listed are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (6,8), (1,6). So Snake #0 must have eaten (6,8) or (1,6). The board shows (6,8) is an apple, and (1,6) is an apple. The state says Snake #0 has 3 apples, so it must have eaten two of these. The board shows (6,8) is an apple, and (1,6) is an apple. The state says Snake #0 has 3 apples, so it must have eaten (6,8) and one other. The board shows (6,8) is an apple, and (1,6) is an apple. The state says Snake #0 has 3 apples, so it must have eaten (6,8) and two others, but only two apples are left in the list. This is confusing. I\u2019ll assume Snake #0 has eaten (6,8) and one other apple not listed in the apples at: list.\n\n**Board State:**\n- (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) eaten by you.\n- (6,8) and (1,6) are apples.\n- Snake #0\u2019s body is at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2).

Eating it would grow the snake to [(0,7), (1,6)].\n   - Check for collisions: Snake #0\u2019s body is at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). No overlap.\n   - Tail is at (0,7). Moving DOWN to (1,6) is safe.\n   - Follow-up moves: If you eat (1,6), you\u2019ll have head (1,6), body [(0,7), (1,6)]. Next move could be LEFT to (1,5) or RIGHT to (1,7).\n3. **LEFT:** From (0,6) to (-1,6) \u2192 off the board (invalid).\n4. **RIGHT:** From (0,6) to (0,7). This is your tail! Moving RIGHT would collide with your own body at (0,7). Invalid.\n\n**Other Moves:**\n- **UP:** Invalid (off board).\n- **LEFT:** Invalid (off board).\n- **RIGHT:** Invalid (collision with tail).\n\n**Only Valid Move: DOWN to (1,6), which is an apple!**\n\n### **Decision:**\nDOWN\n\n---\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for Turns 16\u201330:**\n**Phase 1 (Turns 16\u201320):**\n- **Primary Goal:** Secure (1,6) apple and pivot toward leftward expansion.\n- **Action:** Move DOWN to (1,6), eat apple, grow to [(0,7), (1,6)]. Next turn, move LEFT to (1,5) to reduce distance to (0,2)/(0,3).\n- **Monitor:** Snake #0\u2019s head at (1,2) could move UP/DOWN next turn. If it moves UP to (0,2), block your path. If it moves DOWN to (2,2), it may block your tail at (0,7) in future turns.\n- **Safety:** Avoid moving into Snake #0\u2019s body or its future path.

Move LEFT to **(0,5)** to reduce collision risk with Snake #0\u2019s body extending toward x=0.\n2. **Apple Hunting:** The board shows no remaining apples (assuming the `apples at` list is correct). If future apples appear, prioritize rightward expansion (x=0\u2192x=1\u2192x=2) to block Snake #0\u2019s path while maximizing growth opportunities.\n3. **Snake #0\u2019s Pattern:** Its head is at **(1,2)**, moving vertically. If it continues straight, its body will block x=2 by Turn 20. We must secure x=0\u2013x=1 territory to prevent encroachment.\n4. **Defensive Play:** If Snake #0 tries to expand leftward, we should mirror its movements rightward to maintain separation. Watch for head-on collisions at x=1 or y=6 (your tail\u2019s potential path).\n5. **Risk Mitigation:** Never move backward (into tail) or into Snake #0\u2019s body. If stuck, prioritize moves that leave at least 2 safe follow-up options (e.g., UP/DOWN after LEFT/RIGHT).\n\n---\n**Rationale for Turn 17:**\n- **Current State:** Head at **(0,6)**, body at **(0,5)**, tail at **(0,4)** (after eating the apple at **(0,4)** on Turn 16). Snake #0\u2019s head is at **(1,2)**, body extending toward x=0.\n- **Safe Moves:**\n  - **LEFT:** Move to **(\u20131,6)** \u2192 invalid (off-board). **Invalid.**\n  - **UP:** Move to **(\u20131,6)** \u2192 invalid. **Invalid.**\n  - **RIGHT:** Move to **(0,7)** \u2192 tail collision. **Invalid.**\n  - **DOWN:** Move to **(1,6)** \u2192 safe (no apple, no collision). **Valid.**\n- **Follow-Up Analysis:** If we move DOWN to **(1,6)**, our body will be at **(0,6)** and **(1,5)** next turn. Snake #0\u2019s head at **(1,2)** won\u2019t collide, but we must ensure its body doesn\u2019t block x=0. If Snake #0 moves rightward (x=2\u2192x=3), we can expand leftward next turn.\n- **Risk:** No immediate threat, but Snake #0\u2019s body could block x=0 by Turn 20.
