Moving LEFT advances directly toward (5,9) (2 turns away) in an open row, keeping DOWN for flexibility and avoiding rightward drift near the board edge. DOWN or RIGHT are also safe but detour away from the immediate apple without clear advantage. No head-on collision risk; enemy is distant.\n- **Long-term plan**: After eating the top central apple at (5,9), descend the center column (e.g., to (5,8), then toward (5,6)) to claim the mid-board apples, while zigzagging sideways if needed for evasion.

Snake becomes [(5,9), (6,9)].\n- RIGHT: to (7,9) -> safe (empty cell), but retrograde from last move without benefit.\n\n### Decision factors:\n- LEFT is an immediate win: eat apple, score 1, grow safely with no risks. Keeps me ahead in apples (enemy has 1, I gain to 1).\n- Other moves (DOWN/RIGHT) are safe but suboptimal: they move away from apples without advancing towards others like (6,6) or (5,6). Avoid RIGHT to prevent aimless drifting near edge.\n- No head-on collision risk: enemy is distant (moves towards me would take many turns). No self-collision (no body yet).\n- Keeps future options open: after eating, descending center (x=5 column) towards (5,6) or pivoting sideways for (6,6) maintains flexibility. Monitor enemy for potential upward ascent.\n\n### Long-term plan:\nPost-apple, prioritize descending column 5 (e.g., DOWN to x=5, y=8 towards (5,6)) greedily claiming center apples while keeping lateral escapes. If enemy ascends, intercept or flank; avoid edges. Aim for early apple accumulation to build length for defense/initiation.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN maintains a safe buffer on the west side.\n- Future options: DOWN minimizes traps by sticking to an open edge path south (rows 7-0 in column 0 are unobstructed), flexible for pivoting to (2,0), (1,2), or escaping east if needed.

All keep open paths; no immediate walls or bodies. Be wary of enemy head movements.\n- Apple pursuit: DOWN advances directly to (1,2) (4 steps total to eat: (1,5),(1,4),(1,3),(1,2)).

RIGHT moves x=2,y=6, then need to descend 6 steps to y=0 for (2,0), while (1,2) is faster and could lead to (2,0) next.\n- Avoiding head-ons: Enemy likely to go LEFT toward west/center (e.g., to (2,7), pursuing west apples). If I go RIGHT to (2,6), enemy LEFT puts me at (2,6), them at (2,7)\u2014heads avoid but bodies may crowd. DOWN keeps me west at x=1, maintaining separation; low collision risk since enemy probably not rushing south immediately. LEFT risks meeting enemy if they go west.\n- Future options: DOWN preserves vertical freedom at x=1 (open down to y=0), alternative routes (e.g., RIGHT later if enemy moves east). LEFT or RIGHT explore but tighten if enemy follows.\n\n### Long-term plan for next few turns:\nAfter eating (1,2), continue DOWN to (1,0) or RIGHT to (2,0) if clear. Monitor enemy\u2014shift east toward (6,0) or avoid if they converge west. Target 4-5 apples ahead by grabbing west edge (1,2 then 2,0), watch for head-ons (if enemy goes LEFT, dodge RIGHT to x=2), avoid center traps. Aim to outpace and survive.\n\nDOWN",

Riskier head-on if enemy UP-RIGHT (they might go DOWN first). Tighter space at x=2 (board edges).\n\n### Decision factors:\n- Safety: All keep multiple options; avoid boards/body. DOWN safest long-term (least crowded, separation).\n- Apple pursuit: DOWN gets me to (1,2) fastest (3 steps), setting up next apple (e.g., (0,0) or (2,0)). LEFT/RIGHT delay apples without clear gain.\n- Avoiding collisions: Enemy UP to (2,8) risks nothing now; DOWN to (2,6) brings them south (could threaten if they chase). DOWN keeps x=1 gap, less likely collision. RIGHT closes gap, higher risk. LEFT avoids enemy loop but distracts from apple.\n\n### Long-term plan:\nEat (1,2) next (DOWN twice more), then assess: go DOWN to (1,0), LEFT to (0,0) if clear/easy (4 steps total), or RIGHT to (2,0) (6 steps total). Watch enemy\u2014if they DOWN/LEFT, dodge RIGHT; aim for (6,0) or (9,3) later. Prioritize west apples (0,0, 2,0), stay west to avoid center traps. Survive first, eat 4-5 more.\n\nDOWN",
