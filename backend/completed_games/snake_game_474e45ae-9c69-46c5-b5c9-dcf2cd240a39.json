This keeps options open, moves toward the near apple at (2,3) along the same column, and avoids the enemy\u2019s dense body region to the north.\n\nRationale and plan:\n- Prioritize safety first: avoid self-collision and enemy-body cells. Down and Right are safe; Up is lethal due to self-collision; Left is risky due to the enemy head occupying the target cell.\n- Target near apple: the closest reachable apple is (2,3); heading down from (2,6) puts you on a direct path to it (through (2,5) and (2,4) before reaching (2,3)).\n- After eating or approaching apples, reassess alongside enemy movement; if the enemy closes in on apples, adjust path to avoid head-on collisions and dead-ends, while continuing to collect apples to race toward 30.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move toward apples along safe corridors, prioritizing the vertical path to (2,3) first, then fork toward other apples (e.g., (9,3) or (9,1)) if space opens.\n- Maintain at least two safe future moves ahead to avoid getting trapped by enemy head or walls; avoid aggressive shortcuts that lead into the enemy\u2019s dense body near y=7\u20138.\n- If the enemy dies or moves onto a collision, opportunistically shift toward high-value apples on the right (e.g., near x=9) to maximize apple gain and outpace the other snake.\n- Always avoid moving into your own body and be wary of head-on collisions with the enemy; adjust path to prevent trapping yourself in corners or against your own body.\n\nDOWN",

From (8,3) I have moves (8,4),(9,3),(8,2 tail) available, but (9,3) is along the board edge which slightly limits long-term maneuvering.\n- UP (7,4) keeps me more central (relative to the east side), gives immediate access to (7,5) and (6,4)/(8,4) on the next turn, and stays clear of the dense enemy cluster around x=4..7,y=5..7. It preserves more balanced options (three-way branching) rather than funneling me toward the board edge.\n\nApple considerations:\n- Nearest safe apple to pursue while avoiding the enemy cluster is (8,7). Both UP and RIGHT can reach it in about the same Manhattan distance, but UP keeps more flexible escape routes and avoids pushing toward the board edge too early.\n- Left-side apples (1,3) and (1,5) are far and near the enemy; contesting them now would be risky.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to gain height and maintain multiple escape options.\n- Next turns: continue to gain height and then swing east/north to approach (8,7) safely, avoiding entering the enemy-occupied column 6 above y=5.\n\nUP",

That yields two apples quickly and increases our lead. Neither move invites immediate head-on risk (enemy head is far).\n\nFollow-up options after each move:\n- From (6,9): LEFT or DOWN available (RIGHT would be backwards, UP off-board).\n- From (7,8): LEFT or DOWN available (UP backwards, RIGHT into own body).\n\nDecision:\nTake the quicker, higher-value route to the nearby apple cluster. Move DOWN to (7,8) so I can grab (6,8) next turn and then (6,7), increasing my apple lead while keeping escape options.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Turn 62: LEFT into (6,8) to eat that apple.\n- Turn 63: DOWN into (6,7) to eat that apple.\n- After collecting the cluster, reassess: either continue toward remaining apples (e.g., (2,9) or (9,4)) or loop safely to avoid self-trapping.\n\nDOWN",

That single-escape situation risks getting funneled into the crowded x=6\u20139 area where my body already occupies many cells.\n- RIGHT preserves more options next turn (can go further right or drop down to the row-8 corridor on better terms). No enemy head is close enough to contest (3,8), so there's no head-on danger either way, but survivability and flexibility favor RIGHT.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move RIGHT now to (4,9), then evaluate (5,9) vs (4,8). Prefer moving into open space to the right/top and only commit to eating the (3,8) apple later from a less-constrained approach or ignore it if it would trap me.\n- Avoid getting funneled into the x=7\u20139 corridor; keep routes open toward central apples like (4,4) or (0,3) if safe paths open up.\n\nRIGHT",
