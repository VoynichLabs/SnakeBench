UP: Would move to (4, 10) - This is outside the board (max y is 9). DEATH - eliminate this.\n\n2. DOWN: Would move to (4, 8) - This is safe, on the board, no snake body there.\n\n3. LEFT: Would move to (3, 9) - This is safe, on the board, no snake body there.\n\n4. RIGHT: Would move to (5, 9) - This is safe, on the board, no snake body there.\n\nSo UP is eliminated. Now let me think about which of DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT is best.\n\nLooking at apple locations:\n- (0, 4) - far away, would need to go left and down\n- (8, 1) - far away to the right and down\n- (2, 9) - close! Just 2 steps to the left from my current position\n- (0, 8) - would need to go left and slightly down\n- (8, 0) - far away to the right and down\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 9), which is just 2 cells to my left. If I go LEFT now, I'll be at (3, 9), then one more LEFT gets me to (2, 9).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6, 2), which is quite far from me. It's likely to go for either (8, 1) or (8, 0) since those are closer to it.\n\nStrategy for the next few turns:\n1. Go LEFT to (3, 9)\n2. Go LEFT again to (2, 9) to collect the apple\n3. Then possibly go towards (0, 8) which would be left and down\n\nLet me verify LEFT is safe:\n- (3, 9) is on the board\n- No snake body there\n- Enemy snake head is at (6, 2), can't reach (3, 9) in one move\n\nLEFT seems like the best choice - it moves me directly toward the nearest apple at (2, 9).\n\nAlternative consideration for DOWN:\n- Would put me at (4, 8), closer to apple at (0, 8) in y-coordinate\n- But I'd still need to go left 4 times to reach it\n- Apple at (2, 9) is still closer via the LEFT route\n\nI'll go with LEFT.\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the board, let me analyze my options:\n\n**Current position:** Head at (4, 9)\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- UP: Would go to (4, 10) - OFF THE BOARD, instant death. ELIMINATED.\n- DOWN: Would go to (4, 8) - Safe, open space.\n- LEFT: Would go to (3, 9) - Safe, open space.\n- RIGHT: Would go to (5, 9) - Safe, open space.\n\n**Apple analysis:**\n- Nearest apple is at (2, 9) - just 2 steps to my left!\n- Apple at (0, 8) is also relatively close (left and down)\n- Enemy snake at (6, 2) is far away and will likely go for the apples at (8, 1) or (8, 0)\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\n1. Move LEFT to (3, 9)\n2. Move LEFT again to collect apple at (2, 9)\n3. Then head toward (0, 8) for the next apple\n4. This path keeps me on the top portion of the board while the enemy is in the bottom right area\n\nGoing LEFT puts me on the direct path to the closest apple and keeps plenty of open space available for future moves. The enemy is too far away to pose any immediate threat.\n\nLEFT",

UP: Would move to (2, 10) - This is outside the board (max y is 9). DEATH - eliminate this.\n\n2. DOWN: Would move to (2, 8) - This is safe, on the board, no snake body there.\n\n3. LEFT: Would move to (1, 9) - This is safe, on the board, no snake body there.\n\n4. RIGHT: Would move to (3, 9) - This is where my body is! DEATH - eliminate this (moving backwards into my own body).\n\nSo UP and RIGHT are eliminated.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT\n\nApple analysis:\n- (0, 8) is at the top-left area - I could reach it by going LEFT to (1, 9), then LEFT to (0, 9), then DOWN to (0, 8)\n- (1, 8) is also nearby - I could reach it by going DOWN to (2, 8), then LEFT to (1, 8)\n- (0, 4) is further down on the left\n- (8, 1) and (8, 0) are far away on the right side - enemy is closer to those\n\nLet me think about the paths:\n\nOption A: Go LEFT to (1, 9)\n- Then LEFT to (0, 9)\n- Then DOWN to (0, 8) - APPLE!\n- Distance to apple: 3 moves\n\nOption B: Go DOWN to (2, 8)\n- Then LEFT to (1, 8) - APPLE!\n- Distance to apple: 2 moves\n\nOption B is faster to get an apple! Going DOWN now puts me at (2, 8), then next turn LEFT to (1, 8) gets me an apple.\n\nWait, let me double-check the apple positions:\n- (0, 8) has an apple\n- (1, 8) has an apple\n\nBoth are close! Let me see the board again:\n```\n 9 . . 1 T . . . . . .\n 8 A A . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nYes, there are apples at both (0, 8) and (1, 8).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 8), then LEFT to (1, 8), I get an apple in 2 moves.\nIf I go LEFT to (1, 9), then DOWN to (1, 8), I also get an apple in 2 moves!\n\nBoth paths lead to an apple in 2 moves. Let me think about which is better strategically:\n\nPath via DOWN first: (2,9) -> (2,8) -> (1,8)\n- After getting apple at (1,8), my body will be at (2,8) and (2,9)\n- I can then go LEFT to (0,8) for another apple!\n\nPath via LEFT first: (2,9) -> (1,9) -> (1,8)\n- After getting apple at (1,8), my body will be at (1,9) and (2,9)\n- I can then go LEFT to (0,8) for another apple!\n\nBoth seem similar. Let me think about flexibility:\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 8):\n- Next turn options: UP (back to 2,9 where my tail will be - might be safe if tail moves), LEFT to (1,8) - APPLE, RIGHT to (3,8) - safe\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1, 9):\n- Next turn options: UP (off board - death), DOWN to (1,8) - APPLE, LEFT to (0,9) - safe, RIGHT to (2,9) where my tail will be\n\nHmm, going LEFT limits my options slightly (UP would be death). But either way, I'm going for an apple next turn.\n\nLet me think about the enemy. Enemy is at (6, 2). It's far from me and likely going for (8, 1) or (8, 0). No collision risk.\n\nI'll go with DOWN to (2, 8) because:\n1. It keeps more options open (3 safe moves next turn vs 3 with LEFT but one is more constrained)\n2. Same distance to apple\n3. Sets me up well to grab (1, 8) then (0, 8)\n\nActually wait, let me reconsider. If I go LEFT to (1, 9):\n- Next turn: DOWN to (1, 8) gets apple\n- Then: LEFT to (0, 8) gets another apple\n- This efficiently chains two apples\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 8):\n- Next turn: LEFT to (1, 8) gets apple\n- Then: LEFT to (0, 8) gets another apple\n- Same result\n\nBoth work equally well. I'll go with DOWN since it's slightly more flexible in the immediate next turn.\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n1. This turn: DOWN to (2, 8)\n2. Next turn: LEFT to (1, 8) - collect apple\n3. Turn after: LEFT to (0, 8) - collect apple\n4. Then head down toward (0, 4) for another apple\n\nFinal decision: DOWN\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\n**Current position:** Head at (2, 9), Body at (3, 9)\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- UP: Would go to (2, 10) - OFF THE BOARD. ELIMINATED.\n- DOWN: Would go to (2, 8) - Safe, open space.\n- LEFT: Would go to (1, 9) - Safe, open space.\n- RIGHT: Would go to (3, 9) - That's my body! ELIMINATED.\n\n**Safe moves: DOWN and LEFT**\n\n**Apple analysis:**\n- Apples at (0, 8) and (1, 8) are both very close!\n- If I go DOWN to (2, 8), then LEFT to (1, 8) = apple in 2 moves\n- If I go LEFT to (1, 9), then DOWN to (1, 8) = also apple in 2 moves\n\nBoth paths are equally efficient to reach (1, 8).\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\n- Going DOWN keeps more flexibility (3 valid moves next turn)\n- Going LEFT makes UP a wall-death next turn\n- Enemy at (6, 2) is far away, likely going for (8, 1) or (8, 0)\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. DOWN now to (2, 8)\n2. LEFT to (1, 8) - collect apple (Score: 2)\n3. LEFT to (0, 8) - collect another apple (Score: 3)\n4. Head down toward (0, 4) for more apples\n\nThis efficiently chains multiple apples on the left side of the board while the enemy is occupied on the right.\n\nDOWN",

T . . . . . . .\n 8 A A 1 . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nSo my head is at (2, 8), my tail (T) is at (2, 9).\nThere are apples at (0, 8) and (1, 8) - both directly to my left!\n\nLet me consider my options:\n\n1. UP: Would move to (2, 9) - That's where my body/tail is! But wait, since I moved DOWN last turn and didn't eat an apple, my tail should move. Let me think...\n\nActually, I did eat an apple on turn 1 or 2 (I have 1 apple collected). The snake has head at (2, 8) and body at (2, 9). If I go UP, I'd move into (2, 9) where my body currently is. But will the body move?\n\nThe body segment at (2, 9) is my tail. When I move, the tail follows. So at the moment of the move, my head would move to (2, 9), and simultaneously my tail at (2, 9) would... disappear? No wait, that's not right.\n\nActually in snake, when you move, your head moves to a new position and your tail disappears (unless you ate an apple, in which case you grow). So if I move UP to (2, 9), my current tail at (2, 9) would move away at the same time. But this is effectively moving backwards, which the rules say is death.\n\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n\n(2, 9) is directly behind my head at (2, 8) (since I came from there by going DOWN). So UP would be moving backwards. DEATH - eliminate.\n\n2. DOWN: Would move to (2, 7) - This is safe, open space.\n\n3. LEFT: Would move to (1, 8) - There's an APPLE here! And no snake body. Safe!\n\n4. RIGHT: Would move to (3, 8) - Safe, open space.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n\nApple analysis:\n- (1, 8) is directly to my LEFT - immediate apple!\n- (0, 8) is 2 squares to my left - can get after (1, 8)\n- (0, 4) is further down left\n\nThe clear best move is LEFT to grab the apple at (1, 8)!\n\nAfter eating at (1, 8):\n- My head will be at (1, 8)\n- My body will be at (2, 8), (2, 9) - I grow because I ate an apple\n- Next turn I can go LEFT to (0, 8) for another apple!\n\nThis follows my plan from last turn exactly.\n\nEnemy is at (6, 3) - far away, likely heading toward (8, 1) or (8, 0). No collision risk.\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n1. This turn: LEFT to (1, 8) - collect apple (Score: 2)\n2. Next turn: LEFT to (0, 8) - collect apple (Score: 3)\n3. Then head down toward (0, 4) for another apple\n\nDecision: LEFT\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\n**Current position:** Head at (2, 8), Body at (2, 9)\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- UP: Would go to (2, 9) - That's directly backwards into my body. ELIMINATED (death).\n- DOWN: Would go to (2, 7) - Safe, open space.\n- LEFT: Would go to (1, 8) - Safe AND there's an APPLE there!\n- RIGHT: Would go to (3, 8) - Safe, open space.\n\n**Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**\n\n**Apple analysis:**\nThe apple at (1, 8) is directly to my left - I can grab it immediately! This is exactly what I planned last turn.\n\n**Enemy snake:** At (6, 3), far away. It's likely heading toward the apples at (8, 0) or (8, 1) on the right side. No collision risk.\n\n**Strategic plan for next few turns:**\n1. This turn: LEFT to (1, 8) - collect apple (Score: 2)\n2. Next turn: LEFT to (0, 8) - collect another apple (Score: 3)  \n3. Then DOWN toward (0, 4) for a third apple\n\nThis efficiently chains three apples on the left side while the enemy is occupied on the right side of the board.

UP: Would move to (0, 9) - Looking at row 9, position (0, 9) is empty. Safe.\n\n2. DOWN: Would move to (0, 7) - Looking at row 7, position (0, 7) is empty. Safe.\n\n3. LEFT: Would move to (-1, 8) - That's off the board! DEATH.\n\n4. RIGHT: Would move to (1, 8) - That's where my body is! DEATH.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN\n\nNow let me think about which is better:\n\nApple locations:\n- (0, 4) - directly below me, 4 spaces down\n- (8, 1) - far right bottom area\n- (8, 0) - far right bottom corner\n- (5, 8) - middle right on my row\n- (2, 6) - nearby, 2 right and 2 down\n\nIf I go UP to (0, 9):\n- Next turn I would have to go RIGHT (to (1, 9)) since UP is off board, DOWN leads back to my head's old position, and LEFT is off board\n- Actually, if I go UP to (0, 9), next turn my body will be at (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8) - wait, I don't eat an apple so I stay the same length\n- From (0, 9): UP is off board, DOWN to (0, 8) which would be my body, LEFT is off board, RIGHT to (1, 9) is open\n- So from (0, 9), only RIGHT is safe. That's a bit restrictive.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 7):\n- My body will shift: Head at (0, 7), body at (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8) - wait, do I shrink by 1?\n- I have 3 apples, so my length should be 4 (initial 1 + 3 apples = 4)\n- Current: Head (0, 8), body (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9) - that's 4 segments total\n- After moving DOWN without eating: Head (0, 7), body (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8) - tail moves up from (2, 9)\n- From (0, 7): UP to (0, 8) is my body, DOWN to (0, 6) is open, LEFT is off board, RIGHT to (1, 7) is open\n- So from (0, 7), I can go DOWN or RIGHT. That's 2 options, better than UP's 1 option.\n\nGoing DOWN towards (0, 4) apple makes strategic sense too. Let me continue that path planning:\n- Turn 6: DOWN to (0, 7)\n- Turn 7: DOWN to (0, 6) - open\n- Turn 8: DOWN to (0, 5) - open\n- Turn 9: DOWN to (0, 4) - APPLE! Score becomes 4\n\nActually wait, let me check (2, 6). If I go DOWN now to (0, 7), then:\n- I could go RIGHT to (1, 7), then RIGHT to (2, 7), then DOWN to (2, 6) for the apple\n- Or I could continue down to (0, 4)\n\nBoth paths work. Let me see which is faster:\n- To (0, 4): 4 moves from current position (0, 8)\n- To (2, 6): If I go DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN = 4 moves, or other paths\n\nActually, from (0, 8) to (2, 6) is 2 right and 2 down = 4 moves\nFrom (0, 8) to (0, 4) is 4 down = 4 moves\n\nBoth are equidistant. But (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge which might be safer.\n\nLet me also consider (5, 8):\n- From (0, 8), I'd need to go right 5 spaces\n- But to go RIGHT now would hit my body at (1, 8)\n- If I go UP then RIGHT, I can start heading that way, but UP is restrictive\n\nActually, let me reconsider UP:\n- If I go UP to (0, 9), then RIGHT to (1, 9)\n- From (1, 9): body would be at (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8)\n- Wait, after 2 moves my body shifts. Let me trace:\n\nTurn 6 (now): Move UP to (0, 9). Body becomes (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8). Tail (2, 9) disappears.\nTurn 7: From (0, 9), move RIGHT to (1, 9). Body becomes (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8). Tail (2, 8) disappears.\nTurn 8: From (1, 9), options: UP is off board, DOWN to (1, 8) is body, LEFT to (0, 9) is body, RIGHT to (2, 9) is open.\nSo I can go RIGHT to (2, 9). Then from there, DOWN to (2, 8) which will no longer be body...\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me think simpler.\n\nGoing DOWN seems like the safer and more strategic choice:\n1. It gives me 2 safe options next turn (DOWN to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 7))\n2. It leads me toward two apples: (0, 4) and potentially (2, 6)\n3. It avoids the restrictive top-left corner\n\nEnemy snake at (7, 4) is far away. It might go for (8, 1) or (8, 0). No immediate threat.\n\nDecision: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n1. Turn 6: DOWN to (0, 7)\n2. Turn 7: DOWN to (0, 6) or consider RIGHT to (1, 7) to head toward (2, 6)\n3. Continue toward (0, 4) or (2, 6) whichever seems safer\n4. After collecting those, head toward right side apples (5, 8), (8, 1), (8, 0)\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at my current position:\n\n**Current state:** Head at (0, 8), Body at (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9)\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- UP: Would go to (0, 9) - Safe, but this corners me (only RIGHT would be available next turn)\n- DOWN: Would go to (0, 7) - Safe, opens path toward multiple apples\n- LEFT: Would go to (-1, 8) - OFF THE BOARD!

DEATH\n- DOWN: Would go to (2, 5) - Safe, empty space\n- LEFT: Would go to (1, 6) - Safe, empty space\n- RIGHT: Would go to (3, 6) - Safe, empty space\n\n**Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**\n\n**Analysis of apples:**\n\n1. (0, 4): Distance from (2, 6) = 2 left + 2 down = 4 moves\n   - Path: LEFT to (1, 6), LEFT to (0, 6), DOWN to (0, 5), DOWN to (0, 4)\n\n2. (5, 3): Distance from (2, 6) = 3 right + 3 down = 6 moves\n   - Enemy snake head is at (5, 4), which is right next to this apple!\n   - Enemy might go DOWN to (5, 3) this turn and eat it\n\n3. (5, 8): Distance from (2, 6) = 3 right + 2 up = 5 moves\n\n4. (8, 1): Distance from (2, 6) = 6 right + 5 down = 11 moves\n\n5. (8, 0): Distance from (2, 6) = 6 right + 6 down = 12 moves\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\n- Enemy at (5, 4), apple at (5, 3) is one move DOWN for them\n- They'll likely go DOWN to eat (5, 3)\n- No immediate threat to me\n\n**My strategy from last turn:** Go for (0, 4)\n- Turn 9: LEFT to (1, 6)\n- Turn 10: LEFT to (0, 6)\n- Turn 11: DOWN to (0, 5)\n- Turn 12: DOWN to (0, 4) - apple!\n\nThis still looks like a good plan. Let me verify the path:\n\nFrom (2, 6):\n- Body: [(2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8)]\n\nTurn 9: LEFT to (1, 6) - Is (1, 6) safe? Yes, not part of my body\n- After move, body becomes: [(2, 6), (2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7)] (tail at (0, 8) drops)\n\nTurn 10: LEFT to (0, 6) - Is (0, 6) safe? Yes\n- After move, body becomes: [(1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (1, 7)]\n\nTurn 11: DOWN to (0, 5) - Is (0, 5) safe? Yes\n- After move, body becomes: [(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]\n\nTurn 12: DOWN to (0, 4) - APPLE!\n- After eating, body becomes: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]\n\nThis looks good! (0, 4) is the closest apple and the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could go RIGHT and then head toward (5, 8) but:\n- (5, 8) is farther (5 moves vs 4 moves for (0, 4))\n- The enemy might be heading toward that area after eating (5, 3)\n\nLet me also check DOWN:\n- DOWN to (2, 5) leads toward (5, 3) which the enemy is likely to eat\n- Or I could continue DOWN then LEFT to get (0, 4)\n- Path: DOWN to (2, 5), DOWN to (2, 4), DOWN to (2, 3), LEFT to (1, 3), LEFT to (0, 3), UP to (0, 4) - 6 moves, longer!\n\nSo LEFT is better - it's the shortest path to (0, 4).\n\n**Decision: LEFT**\n\nGoing LEFT to (1, 6) puts me on track for (0, 4) in 4 total moves.\n\nAfter that, I should head toward (5, 8) or the corner apples at (8, 1), (8, 0).\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at my current position:\n\n**Current state:** Head at (2, 6), Body at [(2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8)]\n\n**Possible moves from (2, 6):**\n- UP: Would go to (2, 7) - That's my body! DEATH\n- DOWN: Would go to (2, 5) - Safe, empty space\n- LEFT: Would go to (1, 6) - Safe, empty space\n- RIGHT: Would go to (3, 6) - Safe, empty space\n\n**Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- (0, 4): 4 moves away (2 left + 2 down) - closest!\n- (5, 3): 6 moves away, BUT enemy at (5, 4) is right above it - they'll likely take it this turn\n- (5, 8): 5 moves away\n- (8, 1), (8, 0): Far corner apples - 11-12 moves away\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy head at (5, 4) with apple at (5, 3) right below them. They'll almost certainly go DOWN to eat it. No immediate threat to me.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nFollowing my previous plan to get (0, 4):\n- Turn 9 (now): LEFT to (1, 6)\n- Turn 10: LEFT to (0, 6)\n- Turn 11: DOWN to (0, 5)\n- Turn 12: DOWN to (0, 4) - apple!\n\nAfter (0, 4), I should head toward (5, 8) - go RIGHT across the board then UP.\n\nThe path to (0, 4) is clear and it's the closest apple I can realistically get. LEFT is the optimal move.\n\nLEFT",
