Moving UP gets me on a path to collect it next turn (if I continue UP again). This is the most efficient immediate apple collection strategy.\n\nThe enemy snake at (2, 3) is far away and moving won't create an immediate collision threat on this turn.\n\n**Plan for Next Few Turns:**\n- Turn 0 (now): Move UP to (7, 7)\n- Turn 1: Move UP to (7, 8) to collect the apple\n- Turn 2: Move UP to (7, 9) to collect another apple\n- Then reassess based on remaining apples and enemy position\n\nThis gives me a clean path to secure 2-3 apples quickly while keeping my options open.\n\nUP",

Moving DOWN keeps me away from my own body which is largely to the left and above. Moving RIGHT also stays safe.\n\nGiven the dense apple cluster below (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), moving DOWN to grab (5, 4) is more strategic for rapid apple collection.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n- DOWN this turn to (5, 4) - collect apple #7\n- DOWN next turn to (5, 3) - collect apple #8\n- RIGHT to (6, 3) - collect apple #9\n- Continue harvesting from the dense cluster\n- Monitor enemy growth (currently at (4, 0), still small)\n\nDOWN",
