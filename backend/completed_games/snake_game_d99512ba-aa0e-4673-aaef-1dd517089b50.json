Score is 0.\nApples are at: (8, 4), (8, 7), (0, 8), (3, 1), (1, 7).\n\nI need to choose a move for Turn 0. Since I have no body, the only immediate self-collision risk is moving off the board.\n\n**Possible Moves and Outcomes:**\n\n1.  **UP** to (7, 7):\n    *   Safe from boundaries (0-9).\n    *   Safe from self-collision (no body).\n    *   Enemy head at (4, 4) will move to one of {(3, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5)}. None of these conflict with (7, 7).\n    *   Distance to nearest apples:\n        *   (8, 7) is 1 step away (Right). This apple is very close. (7, 7) to (8, 7) is a move *away* from this apple if I move RIGHT next turn.\n        *   (8, 4) is $\\sqrt{(8-7)^2 + (4-7)^2} = \\sqrt{1+9} \\approx 3.16$ steps away.\n        *   (1, 7) is 6 steps away.\n\n2.  **DOWN** to (7, 5):\n    *   Safe from boundaries.\n    *   Safe from self-collision.\n    *   Enemy head position remains safe.\n    *   This move moves me slightly further away from most apples, but it keeps options open.\n\n3.  **LEFT** to (6, 6):\n    *   Safe from boundaries.\n    *   Safe from self-collision.\n    *   Enemy head position remains safe.\n    *   This move positions me well to potentially cut off the path towards the center or target the apple at (3, 1) later, but it moves away from the cluster of apples on the right side ((8, 4), (8, 7)).\n\n4.  **RIGHT** to (8, 6):\n    *   Safe from boundaries.\n    *   Safe from self-collision.\n    *   Enemy head position remains safe.\n    *   This move brings me adjacent to the apple at (8, 7). If the enemy doesn't significantly block (8, 7) or (8, 4), this seems like the most direct route to scoring first.\n\n**Strategy Evaluation:**\n\nThe primary goal is to eat an apple early to gain length and defensive space. The apples at (8, 7) and (8, 4) are closest/most accessible.\n\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to (8, 6) sets up an immediate shot at (8, 7) next turn (moving UP).\n*   Moving **UP** to (7, 7) also sets up a shot at (8, 7) next turn (moving RIGHT).\n\nLet's analyze the move to (8, 7) (Apple A):\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 6), next turn I can go UP to (8, 7) IF Snake #1 does not move into (8, 7). Snake #1 is at (4, 4). It is highly unlikely to reach (8, 7) immediately.\n\nLet's analyze the move to (7, 7) (UP):\nIf I go UP to (7, 7), next turn I can go RIGHT to (8, 7) IF Snake #1 does not move into (8, 7).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT seem promising for scoring the apple at (8, 7) on Turn 1.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 6): I am one step closer to the right edge apples.\nIf I move UP to (7, 7): I maintain central control horizontally while moving towards the top apples.\n\nSince I have no body, maintaining a relatively central position while heading toward the closest resources is often best. (8, 7) is the most accessible apple right now (distance $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} \\approx 2.23$ steps if I move towards it optimally).\n\nStarting at (7, 6):\nPath to (8, 7): R, U (2 moves)\nPath to (8, 4): R, D, D (3 moves, or R, D, D, D, R - depends on movement)\nPath to (1, 7): L, L, L, L, L, L, L (7 moves)\n\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 6) immediately puts me in a position where moving UP guarantees an apple at (8, 7) next turn, assuming no interference. This seems the most aggressive and direct path to score first.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Target the closest apples on the right side, starting with (8, 7). Move RIGHT this turn.\n\n**Chosen Move:** RIGHT\nNext turn I will aim UP to eat (8, 7).\n\n**Short Term Strategy Note:** Priority is securing the nearest apple at (8, 7). Move RIGHT this turn to prepare for an UP move next turn. Always keep an eye on Snake #1's movement relative to target apples.\nRIGHT",

The goal is to score first against Snake #1.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1 -> Turn 2):**\nMy head is now at (8, 6). I have no body.\nSnake #1 was at (3, 4). It could have moved to (2, 4), (4, 4), (3, 3), or (3, 5).\n\n**Goal for Turn 2:** Eat apple at (8, 7). This requires moving UP from (8, 6).\n\n**Move Analysis (from (8, 6)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   **Collision Check:**\n        *   Board boundaries: Safe (8, 7 is on board).\n        *   Self-collision: Safe (no body).\n        *   Enemy Head Collision: We need to know where Snake #1 moved. Since I don't receive the enemy's move until after the turn resolves, I must analyze potential outcomes or, preferably, choose a move that is safe regardless of the most common/optimal enemy response.\n    *   **Apple Check:** If safe, this eats the apple at (8, 7) and I gain length.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** Moves away from the target apple (8, 7). Still a safe setup move if UP is blocked.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** Moves back to the previous position. Safe but wastes potential scoring turn.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Moves to the edge, slightly further from the target apple (8, 7).\n\n**Anticipating Enemy #1 Move:**\nSnake #1 at (3, 4) aims to move toward nearest apples: (3, 1) or (1, 7) or perhaps just centralize.\n*   To (3, 3) or (3, 5) (vertical move): Doesn't interfere with (8, 7).\n*   To (2, 4) or (4, 4) (horizontal move): Doesn't interfere with (8, 7).\n\nIt is highly improbable that Snake #1 will move to (8, 7) this turn, as that requires 5 moves in the general direction, which is impossible in one turn from (3, 4). Therefore, the UP move to (8, 7) is almost certainly safe and optimal for scoring.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move UP to eat the apple at (8, 7).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Score the apple at (8, 7). Afterwards, the remaining apples closest are (8, 4) and (1, 7). If (8, 7) is eaten, my head will be at (8, 7) and my body length will increase by 1 (tail remains at (8, 6)). The next target will likely be (8, 4) or starting the long trek to (1, 7) or (0, 8). For now, focus on the immediate capture at (8, 7).\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nThe move RIGHT last turn positioned the snake at (8, 6) to target the apple at (8, 7). Since the enemy snake at (3, 4) is far away, the move UP to (8, 7) is safe and results in scoring the first apple, gaining length, and positioning the snake aggressively on the right side edge. This move is chosen under high confidence of success.\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nExecuting the previous move UP resulted in eating the apple at (8, 7).\nNew state: My head is at (8, 7). My body is now (8, 6) [the old head position]. Length increases by 1. Score: 1.\nSnake #1's last position was (3, 4). I need the final board state to determine where Snake #1 went, and where my new tail is, but based on the instructions, I am assuming the move resolved successfully: I ate the apple.\n\n**New Board State Guess (Based on Turn 2 Resolution):**\nHead: (8, 7)\nBody: (8, 6) (Length 1)\nApples left: (8, 4), (0, 8), (3, 1), (1, 7).\n\nNow at (8, 7), the next closest edible apple is (8, 4).\nDistance to (8, 4) from (8, 7) is 3 steps (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN).\n\n**Move Analysis (from (8, 7)):**\nMy current body segment is at (8, 6).\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):** Safe, moves away from the apple cluster on the right.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 6):** This is an immediate backward move into my own body segment (8, 6). **This move results in death.** (Self-collision rule: Moving directly backwards into your own body kills you, even if it's just the position your prior head occupied).\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 7):** Moves towards the center, setting up a potential dive towards (1, 7) or (0, 8) later, or setting up a move towards (8, 4) via (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4) path.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Moves to the edge. Safe.\n\n**Collision Constraint:** I *must* avoid moving DOWN to (8, 6).\n\n**Strategy:** Target (8, 4) next. (8, 7) -> (8, 6) [Forbidden] -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4).\nSince the direct path DOWN is blocked by my own tail segment (which would occupy (8, 6) if I were to move down), I must reroute.\n\nPath to (8, 4) avoiding (8, 6):\nOption A: Reroute via Left/Center\n(8, 7) -> LEFT (7, 7) -> LEFT (6, 7) -> DOWN (6, 6) -> DOWN (6, 5) -> RIGHT (7, 5) -> RIGHT (8, 5) -> DOWN (8, 4). This is long. (7 moves)\n\nOption B: Move around the other side/Edge (If snake is short, moving along the edge is safe)\n(8, 7) -> UP (8, 8) -> RIGHT (9, 8) -> DOWN sequence... also long.\n\nOption C: Quick approach towards the center while staying safe: LEFT (7, 7). This keeps the possibility of heading towards (1, 7) or (0, 8) alive, while still being relatively close to the right edge cluster.\n\nLet's check the enemy's position. Snake #1 moved from (3, 4). Safe assumption: it moved to an adjacent safe spot, e.g., (3, 5). If I go to (7, 7), it is highly unlikely to conflict on this turn.\n\nGiven the immediate backward collision risk, moving LEFT to (7, 7) is the safest and most flexible option. It allows me to re-evaluate the approach to (8, 4) next turn, or pivot towards the left-side apples if the enemy moves aggressively toward (8, 4).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 7):\nNext turn, I can move DOWN to (7, 6), setting up a path toward (8, 4) without immediately crossing the path of my tail at (8, 6).\n(8, 7) [Head]\n(8, 6) [Body]\nMove LEFT -> (7, 7) [New Head]\nNext move DOWN -> (7, 6) [New Head]. Now I am adjacent to the occupied column 8. This seems like a good setup move to approach (8, 4) safely.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Approach the remaining closest apple (8, 4) from the left flank: (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) [Wait, (8, 6) is occupied by my body!]\n\nRe-checking the approach to (8, 4) from (8, 7) while avoiding (8, 6):\n(8, 7) -> (8, 8) [UP] -> (9, 8) [R] -> (9, 7) [D] -> (9, 6) [D] -> (9, 5) [D] -> (8, 5) [L] -> (8, 4) [D]. This is a 7-move circuitous loop if I stay near the edge. Very long.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the target priority. (8, 4) is 3 Manhattan distance away, but the immediate path is blocked by my body. (1, 7) is 8 steps away. (0, 8) is 9 steps away.\n\nSince the direct path to (8, 4) is blocked due to length 1 body, I must move away from that column entirely for a turn or two, or move UP/RIGHT along the perimeter.\n\nMoving UP to (8, 8) seems like the next most logical step if I want to stay on the right side. It keeps options to loop around or swing down later, while being safe.\n\n(8, 7) -> UP (8, 8). Safe. Body is (8, 6) at tail. Segment (8, 6) is not threatened by movement to (8, 8).\nNext turn from (8, 8), I can go RIGHT to (9, 8).\n\nLet's go with the safest move that doesn't backtrack into the body, which is UP.\n\n**Chosen Move:** UP\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Since the direct path to (8, 4) is blocked by the newly formed body segment (8, 6), I will move UP towards the top edge (8, 8) and then potentially RIGHT to (9, 8) to loop around the board edge structure, allowing the tail segment to move away from the (8, X) column before aiming back down towards (8, 4).\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

Previous Body: [(8, 6)].\n    Move UP to (8, 8). It's an apple, so the snake grows.\n    New Head: (8, 8).\n    New Body: (8, 7) [former head].

I must rely on my derived state: Head (8, 8), Body [(8, 7), (8, 6)].)*\n\n**Goal for Turn 3:** Approach (8, 4). The path is currently blocked by my own body segment at (8, 6).\n\n**Move Analysis (from (8, 8)):**\nMy body segments are at (8, 7) [next to head] and (8, 6) [tail].\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 9):** Safe (on board). Keeps options open near the top edge.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 7):** Collision! Hits my own body segment (8, 7). **Kills snake.**\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 8):** Safe move towards the center/left cluster.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):** Safe move along the top edge.\n\n**Enemy Consideration (Snake #1 at T=3):**\nIf Snake #1 moved to (3, 5) last turn, it is now safe from my previous position (8, 7). It is still far away and unlikely to interfere with my movements on the right edge.\n\n**Pathing to (8, 4):** We need to bypass (8, 6).\nIf we move UP to (8, 8) and then RIGHT to (9, 8), the tail at (8, 6) will move one step closer to the head (assuming Snake #1 doesn't eat an apple, thus keeping its length 1).\n\nTurn 3: (8, 8) -> RIGHT (9, 8). Body will be [(8, 8), (8, 7)]. Tail moves from (8, 6) to (8, 7) -> the new tail is (8, 6) and it moves to (8, 5) as the head moves to (9, 8).\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 8):\nNew Head: (9, 8).\nNew Body: (8, 8).\nNew Tail: (8, 7). (The body segment (8, 6) is now the tail, and it moves from (8, 6) to (8, 7) IF the snake did not eat. Since I did not eat this turn, the tail position (8, 6) moves to (8, 5), and the new head position (8, 7) becomes the second segment).\n*Correction on tail movement when NOT eating:* The tail moves one step to the location previously occupied by the segment behind the head, effectively just shifting positions without increasing length. The whole body shifts one cell towards the head's prior location, and the old tail segment is dropped.\nIf Head moves from $H_0$ to $H_1$. Body $B = [B_1, B_2, ..., B_L]$.\nNew Body: $[H_1, B_1, B_2, ..., B_{L-1}]$. The old tail $B_L$ is dropped.\n\nState before move: H=(8, 8), B=[(8, 7), (8, 6)]. L=3.\nMove RIGHT to (9, 8).\nNew H: (9, 8).\nNew B: [(8, 8), (8, 7)]. Tail (8, 6) is dropped.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 8), my tail segment (8, 6) is gone. The path to (8, 4) is now clear, as that structure is no longer blocking the column.\nNext turn (T=4), from (9, 8), I can move DOWN to (9, 7), then DOWN toward (8, 5), then LEFT to (8, 4).\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 9):\nNew H: (8, 9).\nNew B: [(8, 8), (8, 7)]. Tail (8, 6) is dropped.\nThis also clears the path to (8, 4).\n\nComparing RIGHT (9, 8) vs UP (8, 9): Both clear the obstruction (8, 6) by shifting the body forward. (9, 8) moves me slightly closer to the center by hugging the edge, whereas (8, 9) brings me to the very top of the current column. Both are excellent setup moves. (9, 8) seems slightly more progressive towards the center quadrant where (8, 4) sits.\n\nLet's choose RIGHT to gain position along the top edge before dropping down towards (8, 4).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move RIGHT to (9, 8). This move releases the tail segment (8, 6), clearing the way to approach the apple at (8, 4) unobstructed from the right edge (e.g., (9, 8) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4)). This prioritizes the geometrically closest apple cluster ((8, 4)) now that we are no longer constrained by our own body length.\nRIGHT\n**END RATIONALE**",

But the board shows:\n(8, 4), (0, 8), (3, 1), (1, 7), (7, 4) are apples.\nThe apple at (8, 7) *must* have been eaten on Turn 2 for Score: 1. Let's assume the apple at (7, 7) or (9, 7) was erroneously stated or the snake moved to (8, 8) to eat an apple that was previously at (8, 7), despite (8, 7) not being listed as an apple in the current list for T=3.\n\n**CRITICAL ASSUMPTION:** I must trust the provided **Scores so far** and **Your snake** details reflecting the *start* of Turn 3, which implies my previous move was successful and resulted in:\nHead: (9, 7). Body: [(8, 7)]. Apples: 1. (This contradicts the rationale's internal assumption of H=(8,8) B=[(8,7),(8,6)])\n\nLet's strictly adhere to the *current board state and snake data provided for Turn 3*:\nYour snake (ID: 0): Head: (9, 7), Body: [(8, 7)]. Score: 1.\nApples currently available: (8, 4), (0, 8), (3, 1), (1, 7), (7, 4).\nSnake #1 Head: (3, 2), Body: none.\n\nSnake 0 Initial Position T=3: H=(9, 7), B=[(8, 7)]. Length 2.\n\n**Analyzing Moves from (9, 7):**\n1. **UP to (9, 8):** Safe. Board edge.\n2. **DOWN to (9, 6):** Safe.\n3. **LEFT to (8, 7):** Collision! Hits own body segment (8, 7). **Kills snake.**\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 7):** Off board. **Kills snake.**\n\nSafe moves: UP ((9, 8)), DOWN ((9, 6)).\n\n**Goal Check (Closest Apples):**\nH=(9, 7).\nApple list: (8, 4), (0, 8), (3, 1), (1, 7), (7, 4).\nClosest apples are (8, 4) and (7, 4) (Manhattan distance 3, 4 respectively). (1, 7) is Manhattan distance 8/10.\n\nWe need to move away from the right wall edge to approach the primary cluster of apples around (7, 4) and (8, 4). Moving DOWN seems slightly better positioned to start descending towards Y=4 than moving UP to Y=8.\n\nMove DOWN to (9, 6):\nNew H: (9, 6). New B: [(9, 7)]. Tail (8, 7) is dropped. We shed our tail segment, slightly shortening the snake and clearing that location.\n\nEnemy Snake #1: Head at (3, 2). (It needs to move too).\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (3, 3), it heads towards the central apples.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 6), I am setting up a path along the right edge towards (8, 4) via (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4). This looks like a stable, high-probability path to the nearest apples.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move DOWN to (9, 6). This starts the descent towards the apples clustered near Y=4 on the right side. Since the snake is short (Length 2), shedding the tail (8, 7) by moving away doesn't hurt growth prospects much, and it keeps us clear of self-collision opportunities. We will aim for (8, 4) or (7, 4) on the next couple of turns.\n\nDOWN",

This is consistent.)\n\n**My Head (9, 6) Potential Moves:**\n1. **UP to (9, 7):** Safe. Connects to new body segment (9, 7).

Sheds (9, 7) segment.\n4. **RIGHT: Off board.** Killed.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Enemy Head (3, 1) Potential Moves:**\nSnake #1 seems positioned centrally, aiming towards apples (0, 8) or the lower apples like (3, 1) mentioned in T3 state (though not listed in current apples). Current apples: (8, 4), (0, 8), (1, 7), (7, 4), (3, 7). Snake #1's current head (3, 1) is adjacent to apple (3, 7) vertically, but it is far. It is one step away from (3, 0) (off-board) or (4, 1). It is 2 steps from (1, 1) or (5, 1). It is far from apple (3, 7).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (3, 2), it hits its own body segment [(3, 2)]. **This move kills Snake #1.**\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (3, 0): Safe.\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (2, 1): Safe.\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 1): Safe.\n\n**Collision Avoidance:**\nIf I move UP to (9, 7), I restore my body. Snake #1 is nowhere near me.\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 5) or LEFT to (8, 6), I shed length.\n\n**Goal evaluation:** My goal is to reach the apples near Y=4: (8, 4) and (7, 4).\nCurrent position (9, 6).\nMoving DOWN to (9, 5) brings me closer (distance 1 to (8, 4)).\nMoving LEFT to (8, 6) is also good progress toward X=7/8, Y=4. (Distance 2 to (7, 4) or (8, 4)).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 5):\nNext turn, I can move LEFT to (8, 5) or DOWN to (9, 4). (9, 4) is very close to apple (8, 4). This seems like the most direct path to the nearest apples.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 6):\nNext turn, I can move LEFT to (7, 6) or DOWN to (8, 5). (8, 5) leads well to (8, 4).\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT seem good. DOWN keeps us on the X=9 edge slightly longer, which is generally less flexible than shifting inward, but it progresses vertically toward Y=4 faster.\n\nLet's see Snake #1's likely move. If Snake #1 makes a safe move (e.g., RIGHT to (4, 1)), it is moving away from the center cluster of apples near (3, 7) and (1, 7). If it moves DOWN to (3, 0), it's moving away from apples.\n\nSince being far from the opponent minimizes risk, and moving DOWN gets me one step closer to the main apple cluster on the right edge (Y=4), I will prioritize the direct path there.\n\nMove DOWN to (9, 5).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue moving DOWN/LEFT towards the cluster of apples at (7, 4) and (8, 4). I am currently at (9, 6), moving to (9, 5). Next turn, moving to (9, 4) or (8, 5) should put me in prime position for (8, 4) or (7, 4). Snake #1 is far away and seems constrained by its own body segment at (3, 2) if it tries to move UP. I will not worry about the enemy for the next few turns unless they move unexpectedly towards me.\n\nDOWN",

My previous move was DOWN to (9, 5), which was safe and started the descent. Snake #1 is far away near (4, 1) and poses no immediate threat. I need to continue moving generally down and left towards the target apples, ensuring I don't run into the right edge wall unnecessarily.\n\n**Analysis of current move options from (9, 5):**\nMy current position (9, 5) is connected to (9, 6). The cell behind me (backwards move) is (9, 6).\n\n1. **UP to (9, 6):** Moves into my own body segment (9, 6). **Self-Collision / Death.** (Note: Since I just moved from (9, 6) to (9, 5), the cell (9, 6) is now occupied by my tail/body segment. Moving back to it kills me.)\n2. **DOWN to (9, 4):** Safe. Moves me one step closer to the apples (e.g., distance to (8, 4) becomes 2, distance to (7, 4) remains 2). This looks good.\n3. **LEFT to (8, 5):** Safe. Excellent move, advances towards X=7/8 targets and maintains flexibility on Y. This moves me adjacent to the target X coordinate.\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Off board. Death.\n\n**Comparing DOWN (9, 4) vs LEFT (8, 5):**\n*   **LEFT (8, 5):** Puts me adjacent to X=8/7 line. Next move could be UP (8, 6), DOWN (8, 4 - APPLE!), or LEFT (7, 5). Moving DOWN to (8, 4) next turn eats an apple immediately.\n*   **DOWN (9, 4):** Keeps me on the edge. Next move could be UP (9, 5), LEFT (8, 4 - APPLE!), or DOWN (9, 3). Moving LEFT to (8, 4) next turn eats an apple immediately.\n\nBoth moves lead to eating an apple on Turn 6 if I choose the correct follow-up. Moving LEFT (8, 5) is strategically better as it moves me inward, giving more directional choices (UP, DOWN, LEFT) while approaching the target apples, compared to staying on the X=9 edge.\n\n**Enemy Consideration (Snake #1 from (4, 1)):**\nIf S1 moves:\n*   UP to (4, 2): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (4, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (3, 1): Hits own body [(3, 1) is the body, (4, 1) is head]. Wait, S1 body is [(3, 1)]. If S1 moves LEFT to (3, 1), it hits its own body segment. **S1 Dies if it moves LEFT.**\n*   RIGHT to (5, 1): Safe.\n\nS1 is likely to move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. None of these moves pose a threat to my current position (9, 5) or my planned position (8, 5).\n\nI choose **LEFT** to position myself optimally for the apple at (8, 4) on the next turn.\n\nNew long-term plan: Continue advancing towards the (7, 4)/(8, 4) apples, prioritizing moves that bring me adjacent to them. Snake #1 is currently moving away or staying put, posing no threat.\n\nLEFT",

A1 (8, 4) is the most immediately accessible.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (8, 5):**\nMy previous location (body segment) is (9, 5). Moving back to (9, 5) is technically safe if the current head (8, 5) did not move into its own prior location, which is true here since the body only consists of (9, 5) and (8, 5) is the head. However, the rule states: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Since the head is at (8, 5) and the tail segment is at (9, 5), the cell behind the head *relative to the last move* was (9, 5). In this turn, since we haven't moved yet, the cell behind the head (the location before the last move) is (9, 5). If I move LEFT to (7, 5), the cell (8, 5) becomes the new tail segment, and (7, 5) becomes the head. The cell *immediately* behind the current head (8, 5) towards the tail is (9, 5). Moving to (9, 5) means moving from (8, 5) to (9, 5). This is a move into the cell previously occupied by the tail segment, making it generally safe unless the snake grew last turn (it did not). Since the snake length is uniform and no apple was eaten last turn, the tail at (9, 5) will move to (9, 6) if we move RIGHT, or stay at (9, 5) if we move in any other non-head direction. Wait, the standard rule for non-growing moves is that the tail segment vacates its spot.\n\nLet's re-verify the body definition: Head (8, 5), Body [(9, 5)]. Length is 2.\n\n1.  **DOWN to (8, 4) [APPLE A1]:**\n    *   Safe: Yes. This is an apple. I will grow, and my new tail will be (8, 5).\n    *   Advantage: Eats the nearest apple immediately.\n    *   New Head: (8, 4). New Body: [(8, 5), (9, 5)]. Length 3.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 5):**\n    *   Safe: Yes, not hitting (9, 5).\n    *   Advantage: Maintains proximity to A4 (7, 4). Next move could target A4 or A1.\n    *   New Head: (7, 5). (9, 5) becomes tail. New Body: [(9, 5)]. Length 2. (9, 5) vacates its spot, the new tail is (9, 5) which moves to where the old tail was, *unless* the snake doesn't grow. Since we don't eat, the tail vacates (9, 5). We need to know where the old tail tip was. If we assume the tail moves exactly one step by filling the previous head location, this move is safe. The *tail* is at (9, 5) (the coordinate before the head (8, 5)). Moving to (7, 5) means the new tail is officially (9, 5) moving to (8, 5). The new body becomes [(8, 5)]. Wait, the body list should shift: Previous body [(9, 5)] becomes the new second segment. The old tail segment (9, 5) moves to occupy the previous head spot (8, 5). New body = [(8, 5)]. Length remains 2.\n\n3.  **UP to (8, 6):**\n    *   Safe: Yes.\n    *   Compared to LEFT: Less useful for targeting immediate apples.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n    *   Safe: Yes, this is the cell previously occupied by the tail. Since the snake is not growing, the tail vacates this spot. This is typically safe unless the move is mathematically defined as moving backward (which it is not, as the direction sequence was L->D->L. Current head (8, 5), previous segment (9, 5). Moving to (9, 5) completes a U-turn in the *body*, which is usually catastrophic unless the length is > 2 and the position reached is not the immediate previous head position). Since the current segment connection is (8, 5) -> (9, 5), moving from (8, 5) to (9, 5) is moving directly back along the snake's segment path where the body moves out of the way *unless* you grow. If you don't grow, the tail slides. Since (9, 5) is the immediate neighbor in the direction opposite the head, it is USUALLY considered a self-collision in a sliding tail scenario unless specifically allowed. Given the ambiguity, it's safer to avoid it. (The previous move was LEFT from (9, 5) to (8, 5). The tail at (9, 5) *has not* moved yet if we treat this as Turn 6 starting, and the body list represents the structure *before* moving).\n\nLet's clarify the board state reading based on the last move (LEFT from (9, 5) to (8, 5)):\nTurn 5: Head (9, 5), Body [(9, 6)]. Snake moved LEFT.\nIf no apple was hit, the tail segment (9, 6) slides to where the head was (9, 5).\nNew state *before* Turn 6 calculation based on last move: Head (8, 5), Body [(9, 5)]. (This matches the input visualization, suggesting the tail slide occurred for the previous turn).\n\nIf Head is (8, 5) and Body is [(9, 5)], the snake spine is (8, 5) -> (9, 5).\n*   Moving RIGHT to (9, 5) is moving directly into the body segment. **This means RIGHT is a self-collision and results in death.**\n\n**Excluding RIGHT (9, 5) (Self-Collision).**\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake #1):**\nS1 Head (4, 2), Body [(4, 1)]. Target (3, 7) or (1, 7) or (0, 8). They are far from us (8, 5).\nPossible moves for S1: UP (4, 3), DOWN (4, 1) [hits body segment, unless it's the tail sliding, which it is], LEFT (3, 2), RIGHT (5, 2).\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (4, 1), it enters its own body segment [(4, 1)]. Assuming standard sliding tail: If S1 does not eat, the tail segment slides out. If S1 moves DOWN to (4, 1), that cell is currently occupied by its body. This usually means death unless S1's tail is (4, 1) and it vacates. Since S1 length is 2, Body is [(4, 1)]. Head (4, 2). If S1 moves DOWN to (4, 1), it dies (moving from head to body).\nIf S1 moves UP (4, 3), LEFT (3, 2), RIGHT (5, 2), these are safe. S1 is likely to move UP or RIGHT to survive/explore. We don't anticipate collisions with S1.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, UP):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (8, 4):** Eats A1 immediately. Snake grows. Simplest positive outcome. (8, 4) -> New Body [(8, 5), (9, 5)].\n2.  **LEFT (7, 5):** Moves closer to A4 (7, 4) but doesn't eat. Snake length stays 2. Next move likely DOWN to (7, 4) to eat A4.\n3.  **UP (8, 6):** Moves away from immediate targets.\n\nSince (8, 4) is an apple and is adjacent, choosing **DOWN** results in immediate payoff and growth, securing a higher score/length lead, which is crucial early game. Growing also removes the constraint on moving back to the previous position (unless we move adjacent to the *new* tail after growth, which is safer than moving into the old position before sliding).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nTarget the cluster of apples near X=7, 8. Eat the closest one (8, 4) now. After eating, re-evaluate trajectory, likely aiming for (7, 4) next turn. Snake #1 is not a threat for the next few turns.\n\nI choose DOWN to eat the apple at (8, 4).\n\nDOWN",

Apples: 1.\nThis means, based on the visualization (which reflects the end of Turn 6):\nSnake 1's structure is (5, 2) -> (4, 2). Length 2.\n\nMy current coordinates are (8, 4), and the board reflects this (0 at 8, 4).\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Prediction (S1 at (5, 2)):**\nS1 is far from my current position (8, 4). S1 is near apples at (3, 7) and (1, 7).\nSafe moves for S1 from (5, 2):\n1. UP (5, 3): Safe.\n2. DOWN (5, 1): Safe.\n3. LEFT (4, 2): Collision with body segment [(4, 2)]. If it's a sliding tail, collision occurs because the vector heads into the body. **S1 dies if it moves LEFT.** (Unless (4, 2) is the tail segment *and* is sliding out, but moving from (5, 2) to (4, 2) is moving directly into the existing body segment). Assuming standard self-collision rules apply to enemies too, LEFT is suicidal.\n4. RIGHT (6, 2): Safe.\n\nS1 will likely move UP (5, 3) or RIGHT (6, 2) targeting the upper left area.\n\n**My Strategy from (8, 4):**\nTarget A4 (7, 4) next.\n1. **LEFT (7, 4) [EAT A4]:** Ideal move. Eat A4. Grow to length 4. New body: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5)].\n2. **UP (8, 5):** Move into previously occupied head space. Safe path extension. Less immediate reward than LEFT.\n3. **DOWN (8, 3):** Safe extension, but moves away from A4.\n4. **RIGHT (9, 4):** Safe extension, moves away from A4/A5.\n\nMoving **LEFT (7, 4)** maximizes short-term gain by eating the nearest accessible apple immediately adjacent to the current head location. This move is safe: (7, 4) is currently empty, and it is not the cell vacated by the tail (which happened on the previous turn since we ate).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Eat A4 (7, 4) now. Then, reassess the path towards the remaining apples (0, 8), (1, 7), (3, 7). The upper left corner is rich in apples. We are now 3 apples ahead, which provides resilience. Keep focusing on greedy apple collection while maintaining a reasonable length advantage and safety margin from S1.\n\nMove: LEFT\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Length 5. Apples: 4.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Prediction (S1 at (5, 2)):**\nIn the rationale for Turn 7, I predicted S1 would move UP to (5, 3) or RIGHT to (6, 2).\nLet's verify the board state provided for Turn 8:\nSnake #1 - Head: (5, 3), Body: [(5, 2)], Apples: 1.\nThis confirms S1 chose UP: (5, 2) -> (5, 3). The tail segment (4, 2) slid to (5, 2). So S1's body is now (5, 3) -> (5, 2). Length 2.\n\n**Current State (Start of Turn 8):**\nMy Head: (7, 4). My Body: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5)]. (Apples: 3 before the move, 4 after eating).\nS1 Head: (5, 3). S1 Body: [(5, 2)]. (Apples: 1).\n\n**Apples remaining:** (0, 8), (1, 7), (3, 7), (6, 6).\n\n**My Next Target:**\nThe closest remaining apples are (3, 7) and (6, 6). (6, 6) is closer to my head at (7, 4). Distance: 2 moves (LEFT, DOWN). (3, 7) is distance 4 moves away (LEFT, LEFT, UP+1? or diagonal).\n\nTarget A5 = (6, 6).\n\n**Possible Moves from (7, 4):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (6, 4):** Moves towards (6, 6). Safe. (6, 4) is empty.\n2.  **UP (7, 5):** Moves away slightly from (6, 6) but keeps options open for the top row. Safe. (7, 5) is empty.\n3.  **DOWN (7, 3):** Moves away from the action. Safe. (7, 3) is empty.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 4):** Moves backwards into my own body segment [(8, 4)]. **RISKY/SUICIDAL.** A move to (8, 4) is illegal because (8, 4) is the first segment of my body (the one that slid back one position due to eating the apple at (7, 4) in the previous turn, which is now the new segment RIGHT behind the head).\n    *Wait, let's reconfirm body structure after eating at (7, 4):*\n    Old Head (8, 4). Eaten at (7, 4).\n    New Head: (7, 4). New Body: (8, 4) [old head], (8, 5), (9, 5).\n    The tail segment (9, 5) did not move because we ate.\n    If I move RIGHT to (8, 4), I hit my body [(8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5)]. **RIGHT is a self-collision and results in death.**\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (S1 at (5, 3)):**\nS1 is relatively far and has few immediate threats. S1 probably aims for (3, 7) or seeks safety.\nFrom (5, 3) to (3, 7), S1 has several options.\nIf S1 moves LEFT (4, 3), it maintains pressure towards the remaining apples on the left.\nIf S1 moves into the corner: (5, 3) to (5, 4) [UP] or (4, 3) [LEFT]. Both are safe. Let's assume S1 continues navigation towards the cluster (0, 8), (1, 7), (3, 7) by moving LEFT. S1 moves to (4, 3).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves for Me:** UP, DOWN, LEFT. Target (6, 6).\n\n*   **LEFT (6, 4):** Moves one step closer to (6, 6). Safe from S1 (S1 is at (5, 3) or (4, 3)). Safe from self-collision.\n*   **UP (7, 5):** Stays high, perhaps setting up a future diagonal move to (6, 6) next turn via (6, 5) or (7, 6). Safe.\n\nSince (6, 6) is the nearest valuable apple, moving towards it seems optimal. Moving LEFT to (6, 4) is the most direct path currently.\n\n**Checking future safety after LEFT to (6, 4):**\nMy new head is (6, 4). My body is new head (7, 4), old body [(8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5)].\nIf S1 moves to (4, 3), the gap between us remains significant (e.g., (6, 4) vs (4, 3)). No imminent threat.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue greedy collection, focusing on the remaining clusters. (6, 6) is best now, followed by the cluster near (1, 7) and (3, 7). Since we are ahead on score (4 vs 1), a direct path of collecting the closest apples is usually best unless we get boxed in. LEFT seems the best greedy move.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Target apple (6, 6) next turn if reachable. Then pivot towards the cluster in the upper left (1, 7), (3, 7), (0, 8). Maintain positional safety, especially guarding coordinate 8 on the X-axis as we move leftwards.\n\nLEFT",

(Length 5)\nSnake #1 (ID 1) head: (5, 3). Body: [(5, 2)]. Apples: 1. (Length 2)\n\n**Last Move Review:** My move was LEFT, landing on (6, 4). I ate (6, 6) in the previous turn (Turn 8).\n*Self-Correction on Turn 8 Rationale:* I intended to target (6, 6) but miscalculated distances or the board state.\nLet's re-establish the state after Turn 8 move LEFT to (6, 4). (This means my last move was LEFT from (7, 4)).\n\nIf my head was (7, 4) and I moved LEFT to (6, 4):\n1. If (6, 4) had an apple, I eat it and grow.\n2. If (6, 4) did not have an apple, my tail segment (9, 5) would have been removed.\n\n**Checking Apple Locations for Turn 8:**\nApples at Start of Turn 8 (after eating at (7,4) in T8): (0, 8), (1, 7), (3, 7), (6, 6).\nMy head moved from (7, 4) to (6, 4) via LEFT. (6, 4) is empty. I did not eat an apple.\nMy body growth status: Since I ate an apple at (7, 4) on Turn 8, I did not lose my tail segment.\nMy body was: Head (7, 4), Body [(8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5)]. Length 4.\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 4) without eating: Tail (9, 5) is removed.\nNew body: Head (6, 4), Body [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)]. Length 4. Apples: 3 (I ate 1 at 7,4).\n*Wait, the provided state says Score: 3 apples, Body size 4 (Head + 3 segments). This implies the move in Turn 8 DID NOT result in eating an apple at (7,4) OR the provided state summary is based on the move itself happening this turn.*\n\n**Reconciling State Discrepancies:**\nThe provided state reflects the board *before* Turn 9 actions, but *after* Turn 8 actions have completed.\nTurn 8: Head at (7, 4). Body: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5)]. Apples: 3. This means the move that placed the head at (7, 4) consumed an apple, but the body did not grow because the tail wasn't necessarily removed if length increased, OR the tail moved forward as usual if no apple was eaten.\n\n*If I ate at (7, 4) in T8:* Length should be 5 (4 segments + head). Body list shows 3 segments. This implies I did NOT eat an apple that landed on (7, 4) in T8, OR the provided body list is incomplete/incorrect for T8, OR the score of 3 is correct, implying the body did shrink by 1 (if I moved into an empty spot).\n\nLet's assume the provided Current State for Turn 9 is accurate:\nMy Head: (6, 4). Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)]. Length 4. Apples: 3.\nThis means my previous move (LEFT from (7, 4)) landed me on (6, 4), which was an empty spot, causing my tail (9, 5) to disappear. The previous score being 3 supports this interpretation (no growth).\n\n**Current State for Turn 9:**\nMy Head (0): (6, 4). My Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)].\nS1 Head (1): (5, 3). S1 Body: [(5, 2)].\n\nApples remaining (A): (0, 8), (1, 7), (3, 7), (6, 6).\n\n**Target Selection:**\nClosest apple to (6, 4) is (6, 6). Distance 2 (Up, Up).\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S1 from (5, 3)):**\nS1 still has access to the left/top cluster: (3, 7), (1, 7), (0, 8). If S1 moves UP to (5, 4), it moves toward (6, 6) as well, but slightly slower than me if I go UP/DOWN. If S1 moves LEFT to (4, 3), it targets (3, 7).\n\nLet's evaluate my move options from (6, 4):\n\n1.  **UP (6, 5):** Moves towards (6, 6). Safe from self (neighboring body parts: (7, 4)). Safe from (5, 3). (6, 5) is empty.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):** Moves away from (6, 6). Safe. (6, 3) is empty.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):** Moves towards (6, 6) via sideways approach. (5, 4) is empty. **CRITICAL CHECK: S1 Head is at (5, 3). If S1 moves UP to (5, 4), we collide.**\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** Moves backwards into my body segment [(7, 4)]. **SUICIDE.**\n\n**Collision Check for LEFT (5, 4):**\nIf S1 moves UP to (5, 4), we collide. If S1 moves LEFT to (4, 3), I am safe at (5, 4). If S1 moves DOWN to (5, 2), I am safe at (5, 4). If S1 stays at (5, 3) (not possible, must move), or moves RIGHT to (6, 3), I am safe at (5, 4).\nA move to (5, 4) is risky because S1 might choose UP.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:** UP (6, 5) or DOWN (6, 3).\n\n**Move UP (6, 5):**\nPro: Direct path towards (6, 6). If S1 moves UP to (5, 4), I am safe at (6, 5). Next turn I can move UP again to (6, 6) for an apple.\nCon: If S1 moves LEFT to (4, 3), it heads toward the primary cluster of apples.\n\n**Move DOWN (6, 3):**\nPro: Completely safe regarding S1, as S1 is much higher up.\nCon: Delays reaching (6, 6).\n\nSince (6, 6) is the nearest, a direct route is preferred unless it forces a collision or a bad future state. Moving UP to (6, 5) seems much safer than moving LEFT to (5, 4) because UP guarantees safety from S1's potential UP move, while LEFT guarantees collision if S1 moves UP.\n\n**S1 Prediction based on UP (6, 5):**\nIf I go UP to (6, 5). S1 must decide between (5, 4) UP, (4, 3) LEFT, (5, 2) DOWN (into its own tail structure if it was length 3, but it is length 2, so (5, 2) is its tail, (5, 3) -> (5, 2) if it moves toward (5, 2)'s old spot). If S1 moves towards (3, 7), it targets LEFT (4, 3).\n\nIf S1 moves (4, 3) and I move (6, 5): We are both progressing towards separate apples safely. Next turn: I aim for (6, 6). S1 aims for (3, 7). This seems balanced and maximizes my immediate gains.\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 5), my next move can be UP to (6, 6) and eat the apple, growing my snake. This is a high-priority aggressive move.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Collect (6, 6) next turn. Then immediately change direction towards the crowded upper-left cluster ((3, 7), (1, 7), (0, 8)). Maintain control of the right side of the board temporarily to maximize exploration space. Avoid X=5 boundary where S1 is operating unless necessary for an apple.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

(7, 4) (RIGHT) is self-collision.\n\nWe must consider Snake #1's move from (5, 3). Snake #1 is likely targeting the upper-left apples. Potential moves for S1: (5, 4) UP, (4, 3) LEFT, (5, 2) DOWN (into its tail segment, unlikely unless it's forced or has no other options). S1 will likely move UP to (5, 4) or LEFT to (4, 3).\n\n**Analysis of My Next Move Options (From (6, 4)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):**\n    *   If S1 moves UP to (5, 4): Safe.

S1 might consume (6, 6) if it turns sharply later, although (6, 6) is far for S1.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 4):**\n    *   If S1 moves UP to (5, 4): **HEAD-ON COLLISION.

On T11, move UP again to (6, 6) to secure the apple and grow. After T11, reassess paths to the cluster of apples in the (0-3, 7-8) region, while being mindful of my body growth in the (7, 8) column.\n\nUP",

Let's reconcile with the last move info.)\n\n**Reconciling Last Move:**\n*   Last turn (T10), my head was at (6, 4).\n*   My chosen move was UP, leading to (6, 5).\n*   The current board state indicates my head is at (6, 6). This suggests two things:\n    1.  The board state provided reflects the board *after* my move on Turn 10 and *before* my move on Turn 11.\n    2.  The move from T10 resulted in (6, 6). If my head was (6, 4) and I moved UP, I should be at (6, 5). If the board shows (6, 6), I must have moved UP twice or the provided board state implicitly includes the result of my UP move from T10 *and* the anticipated result of the move I am about to make for T11 is missing from the 'Your snake' section, or my last move was actually UP twice?\n\nLet's trust the provided *current* Snake Coordinates and Apple locations for calculating T11's move:\n*   **My Head (ID 0): (6, 6)**.\n*   Apples: (0, 8), (1, 7), (3, 7), (0, 4), (3, 1).\n*   My Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)] (Length 5, Apple count 4).\n*   Snake #1 Head: (3, 4), Body: [(4, 4)]. (Length 2, Apple count 1).\n\nThe previous rationale must have been for T10, and its conclusion *UP* resulted in the head moving from (6, 4) to (6, 5). If the current head is (6, 6), the game state implies I already moved UP again, or the starting state listed for Turn 11 is based on an assumed move I made but wasn't explicitly noted in the move log structure.\n\n**Strategy based on Current State (Head at (6, 6)):**\nI am currently on top of where Apple (6, 6) *used* to be in the T10 setup, but Apple (6, 6) is *not* listed in the current apples for T11. The current apples are: (0, 8), (1, 7), (3, 7), (0, 4), (3, 1).\nThis confirms that my head is *not* on an apple based on the listed apple locations. I must have simply moved up to (6, 6) previously, and the body grew slightly differently than anticipated, or the board visualization reflects a successful move/growth that isn't perfectly reflected in the simple apple list transition.\n\nGiven the current head at $\\mathbf{(6, 6)}$:\n**Goal:** Move towards the nearest apples: (1, 7) or (3, 7), or (0, 8). The cluster (0, 8), (1, 7), (3, 7) seems like the best target area.\n\n**Safe Moves from (6, 6):**\n1.  UP to (6, 7): Safe from self-collision.\n2.  DOWN to (6, 5): Collision with my own body segment (6, 5). **Self-collision. DEAD.**\n3.  LEFT to (5, 6): Safe from self-collision.\n4.  RIGHT to (7, 6): Safe from self-collision.\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** DOWN is illegal (into body segment at (6, 5)).\n\n**Enemy Position Check (Snake #1):** Head at (3, 4). Body at (4, 4).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):**\n    *   Good path towards the apples in the top row.\n    *   Enemy's potential move: S1 at (3, 4) might move UP towards (3, 5) or LEFT towards (2, 4). No immediate threat.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 6):**\n    *   Moves me slightly closer to the central area, setting up a move toward (3, 7) on the next turn.\n    *   If S1 moves right towards (4, 4) -> (5, 4) or (4, 5), this is fine.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n    *   Moves away from all apples and towards the edge, less optimal.\n\n**Comparing UP (6, 7) vs LEFT (5, 6):**\nThe major apple density is to the left and up. Moving to (6, 7) directly targets the upper edge. Moving to (5, 6) sets up a better angle to approach the (1, 7) / (3, 7) apples while keeping options open.\n\nTargeting (3, 7) seems viable.\nIf I go UP to (6, 7): Next move can be LEFT to (5, 7) or (5, 6).\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 6): Next move can be LEFT to (4, 6) or UP to (5, 7).\n\nMoving LEFT seems strategically superior as it reduces the X coordinate faster, bringing the head closer to X=0 where the remaining apples (0, 8), (0, 4) reside, and facilitates the approach to the central apple (3, 7).\n\nLet's predict S1's move from (3, 4), Body: [(4, 4)]. S1 is small and near the middle. They might move towards (0, 4) or (3, 1).\nIf S1 moves UP to (3, 5): Safe.\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (2, 4): Safe.\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 4): Collision with its own body (4, 4). DEAD if S1 moves RIGHT. (If S1 moves (3, 4) -> (4, 4), S1 dies).\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (3, 3): Safe.\n\nS1 has several safe moves (Up, Left, Down). I don't need to worry about immediate collision with S1.\n\nTherefore, choosing LEFT (5, 6) to improve approach angle towards the clustered apples (1, 7), (3, 7).\n\nPath Goal: (5, 6) -> (5, 7) or (4, 6) -> (3, 7) or (4, 7).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move toward the apples clustered around Y=7, prioritizing a path that allows access to (0, 8) later. Stay clear of the right side and the tail of my own snake which blocks downward movement from (6, 6).\n\nLEFT\n**END RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

A more indirect approach to (3, 7).\n\nMoving UP is more directly aimed at the Y=7 line, which seems like the strongest immediate target zone. If I reach (6, 7), I can then move LEFT on the next turn towards (5, 7) or (4, 7) to close in on (3, 7).\n\nLet's pursue the path that minimizes Manhattan distance to (3, 7) while staying safe.\n(6, 6) -> (6, 7) [1 step, Manhattan distance to (3, 7) is now 4]\n(6, 6) -> (5, 6) [1 step, Manhattan distance to (3, 7) is now 4]\n\nBoth lead to the same distance, but UP keeps me higher, allowing for potential sideways movement without dropping onto lower ground where other apples are scattered less effectively (like (3, 1)).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move UP to (6, 7) to align with the cluster of apples at Y=7. On the next turn, maneuver leftwards towards (3, 7) or (1, 7). Maintain awareness of Snake #1, which is vulnerable if it tries to move right.\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\nUP",

Based on board: (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4) -> Length 3)\n\n**Board State Confirmation (Based on description):**\nSnake 0 (T): (4, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 5). (Note: The provided visualization for Turn 13 seems to have used slightly different body coordinates than stated in the text above the rationale, but I will follow the explicit coordinates provided by the game state description for Turn 14, even though the last move rationale was based on different coordinates/state.)\n\n**Using State provided for Turn 14:**\nYour Head: (4, 7)\nYour Body: B0 = {(5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5)}\nYour Length: 5 (4 apples collected + 1 starting cell)\n\nPossible moves from (4, 7):\n1.  **UP (4, 8):** Safe?

This is an Apple (A(3, 7)). **Eating Apple.**\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 7):** Collision with body segment (5, 7). **DEAD.**\n\nEliminated Moves: RIGHT.\n\nSafe moves for Snake 0 (S0): UP (4, 8), DOWN (4, 6), LEFT (3, 7) (Eat Apple)\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (S1) Analysis (Head at (0, 4)):**\nS1 Options from (0, 4):\n1.  **UP (0, 5):** Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 3):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 4):** Off board. **DEAD.**\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 4):** Collision with body segment (1, 4). **DEAD.**\n\nS1 only has moves UP (0, 5) or DOWN (0, 3). S1 will likely move to (0, 5) or (0, 3). In either case, S1 stays localized in the bottom-left corner and will not interfere with paths near Y=7 or Y=8 this turn.\n\n**Collision Check with Safe Moves (S0 vs S1):**\nS0 safe destinations: (4, 8), (4, 6), (3, 7).\nS1 likely destinations: (0, 5) or (0, 3).\nNo head-on collisions are possible, and S0 cannot run into S1's body.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\nThe best move is usually to eat an apple if safe.\n**LEFT (3, 7):** Eats Apple A(3, 7). S0 grows to length 6. This is highly desirable. The new head position (3, 7) is excellent for pursuing the other close apple A(1, 7) or A(0, 8) next turn.\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (3, 7):\nNew Head: (3, 7). Body: (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6).

This looks like a strong immediate plan.\n\n**Future Note:** Plan to eat (1, 7) next turn if possible. If I move LEFT twice, S1 might move aggressively towards the top edge, but S1 is currently contained in the bottom left.\n\nI choose LEFT to position for the next apple (1, 7).\n\nLEFT",

Securing the immediate apple is usually the best move when available.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\n1. Eat (1, 7) now by moving LEFT.\n2. Assess remaining apples: (0, 8), (3, 1), (4, 9), (3, 4).\n3. After eating (1, 7), my head will be at (1, 7).

My new body is: [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)]. (The previous head (2, 7) becomes the new neck, and the old tail (6, 6) is dropped if no apple was eaten, or retained if an apple was eaten. Since I ate, the body extends by 1).\nNew body: Head (1, 7), B1(2, 7), B2(3, 7), B3(4, 7), B4(5, 7), B5(5, 6), B6(6, 6). Length 7. Score 6. This matches the board state observation relative to the previous turn's move execution.\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (S1) movement from last turn:\nS1 Head was at (0, 6). S1 safe moves were (0, 7) or (1, 6).\nS1's movement is unknown based on the provided state, but the current board shows S1 Head at (0, 7). This implies S1 moved UP from (0, 6) to (0, 7) last turn.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 17):**\nSnake 0 (Me): Head (1, 7). Body $B_0 = \\{(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)\\}$. Total occupied: 7 cells.\nSnake 1 (S1): Head (0, 7). Body $B_1 = \\{(0, 6), (0, 5)\\}$. Total occupied: 3 cells.\n\n**Immediate Danger Check:**\n1. Self-collision: Moving backwards from (1, 7) is to (2, 7). (2, 7) is my neck. Moving LEFT from (1, 7) is to (0, 7). (0, 7) is S1's head. Moving RIGHT from (1, 7) is to (2, 7), which IS my neck. **WAIT: (2, 7) is my neck, which is always safe unless I move backwards into it.** Moving backwards from (1, 7) means moving to (2, 7) if the previous state had (2, 7) as the head and (1, 7) as the neck.\n*My body list provided is Head-to-Tail:* [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)].\nSince I ate, the new head is (1, 7). The new neck (the segment directly behind the head) is the old head position: (2, 7).\nMoving backwards from (1, 7) to (2, 7) IS self-collision. **So, (2, 7) is an occupied cell I cannot move into.**\n\n2. Head-to-Head collision: S0 Head (1, 7) vs S1 Head (0, 7).\nS0 possible moves:\n   - UP (1, 8): Safe regarding S1 head.\n   - DOWN (1, 6): Safe regarding S1 head.\n   - LEFT (0, 7): **Collision with S1 Head (0, 7)! DEAD.**\n   - RIGHT (2, 7): Safe regarding S1 head, but collision with my own body segment (neck). **DEAD.**\n\nS1 possible moves from (0, 7):\n   - UP (0, 8): Apple A here.\n   - DOWN (0, 6): Part of S1 body. **S1 DEAD if it moves here.**\n   - LEFT (-1, 7): Off board. **S1 DEAD if it moves here.**\n   - RIGHT (1, 7): Collision with S0 Head (1, 7)! **S1 DEAD if it moves here.**\n\n**S0 Safe Moves:**\n1. UP (1, 8): Safe from self.\n2. DOWN (1, 6): Safe from self.\n3. LEFT (0, 7): Hits S1 Head. S0 dies.\n4. RIGHT (2, 7): Hits S0 Neck. S0 dies.\n\nS0 Safe Moves: UP (1, 8) or DOWN (1, 6).\n\n**S1 Head Collision Potential (Must account for simultaneous movement):**\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (2, 7): S1 can move RIGHT to (1, 7). This would be a head-to-head collision with my *previous* head position, which is now my neck, but S1 moves there, and I want to move there too? No, that's not right.\n\nLet's stick to self-check first:\nS0 HEAD (1, 7). Neck is (2, 7). Tail is (6, 6).\nForbidden cells for S0:\na) Off-board.\nb) $B_0 = \\{(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)\\}$.\nc) $\\{(0, 7)\\}$ (S1 Head) -- potential collision.\n\nS0 Move Analysis:\n1. UP (1, 8): Unoccupied, safe from self.\n2. DOWN (1, 6): Unoccupied, safe from self.\n3. LEFT (0, 7): Occupied by S1 head. **Collision.**\n4. RIGHT (2, 7): Occupied by S0 body (neck). **Self-collision.**\n\nS0 Safe Moves: UP (1, 8) or DOWN (1, 6).\n\n**S1 Intent Analysis (Crucial):**\nS1 Head is at (0, 7).\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (1, 7), it lands on my current head position. This is a head-to-head collision, meaning both snakes die immediately. We must avoid moves that allow S1 to move into (1, 7) if we move there, or we must avoid moving into (0, 7) if S1 moves there.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (1, 8):\nS1 might move RIGHT to (1, 7). S0 is at (1, 8). No collision.\nS1 might move UP to (0, 8). S0 is at (1, 8). No collision.\nIf S1 moves to (0, 8) (eating apple A), S0 is safe.\n\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (1, 6):\nS1 might move RIGHT to (1, 7). S0 is at (1, 6). No collision. S1 eats the apple at (1, 7) if it existed, but (1, 7) is now empty since the apple was consumed last turn.\n\n**Apple Targets Remain:** (0, 8), (3, 1), (4, 9), (3, 4), (7, 0).\n\n**Comparing UP vs DOWN:**\nMoving UP to (1, 8) puts me immediately adjacent to the apple at (0, 8). This seems like the strongest strategic move, continuing the push towards the cluster of high-Y apples.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (1, 8):\nS1 needs to decide between:\na) UP to (0, 8) [Eats Apple]. S0 is safe at (1, 8). S1 score increases.\nb) RIGHT to (1, 7). S0 is safe at (1, 8).\n\nIf S1 moves to (0, 8), it claims that resource. If S1 moves to (1, 7) or any other safe spot, I maintain the initiative towards (0, 8) next turn by moving LEFT to (0, 8).\n\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (1, 6):\nI am moving away from the nearest apple cluster ((0, 8) and (4, 9)). This seems suboptimal.\n\n**Checking collision potential if S0 moves UP to (1, 8):**\nS0 Target: (1, 8).\nS1 Target: S1 will likely aim for (0, 8) or try to position defensively near (1, 7) if it perceives a threat.\nIf S1 goes UP to (0, 8) [Eats Apple]: S0 safe.\nIf S1 goes RIGHT to (1, 7): S0 safe. If S1 moves to (1, 7), it is now adjacent to S0's head (1, 8) on the Y-axis. This is a slightly tighter configuration but S0 still has options (LEFT (0, 8) or DOWN (1, 7) if S1 moves away).\n\nThe move UP seems best. It positions me perfectly to contest or claim (0, 8) next turn, regardless of S1's choice, given that S1's primary alternative move to (0, 8) eats the apple, making it less threatening to me immediately on the next turn if I can only get to (0, 8) by entering its former spot.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. Move UP to (1, 8) to contest or position for the (0, 8) apple.\n2. Next turn, aim to move to (0, 8) if unoccupied, or pivot towards (4, 9) if (0, 8) is taken by S1. S1 is very unlikely to block high ground effectively given its current low position on the left edge.\n\nUP\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Self:**\nMove UP aims for the (0, 8) apple. If S1 takes (0, 8), immediately pivot towards (4, 9), as it is the next highest value target after the top-left cluster. If S1 stays low, continue clearing the top edge.\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

S1 Head: (0, 8).\n\nLet's reconcile the provided state information vs the move:\n**Provided T18 State:**\nS0 Head: (1, 8). Body: [(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 6. Score 6.

(This implies S1 moved UP from (0, 7) and ate the apple at (0, 8)).\n\n**Implied move of S0 (Me): UP from (1, 7) to (1, 8).** (Matches my chosen move, and consistent with S0 state change: tail (6, 6) dropped).\n**Implied move of S1:** UP from (0, 7) to (0, 8) [Eats Apple]. (Consistent with S1 state change: ate apple, length increased by 1, head moved to (0, 8)).\n\n**Confirmed Current State (Turn 18):**\nS0 Head: (1, 8). Body $B_0 = \\{(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)\\}$. Length 6.\nS1 Head: (0, 8). Body $B_1 = \\{(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5)\\}$. Length 4.

RIGHT (2, 8): Safe from self.\n\nS0 Safe Moves: UP (1, 9) or RIGHT (2, 8).\n\n**S1 Threat Analysis from (0, 8):**\nS1 Head (0, 8). Neck is (0, 7).\nS1 Safe Moves (assuming it avoids collision with $B_0$):\n   - DOWN (0, 7): Hits S1 neck. DEAD.\n   - RIGHT (1, 8): Hits S0 Head (1, 8). Head-on collision, both die. DEAD.\n   - UP (0, 9): Safe from self.\n   - LEFT (-1, 8): Off board. DEAD.\n\nS1 only has one immediate safe move: UP to (0, 9).\n\n**S0 Choice:**\nIf S0 chooses UP to (1, 9):\nS1 will likely choose UP to (0, 9) (only safe move).\nWe end up side-by-side at Y=9.\nS0 @ (1, 9). S1 @ (0, 9).\nNext turn, S0 can move RIGHT to (2, 9) or DOWN to (1, 8).\nS1 options: DOWN to (0, 8) or RIGHT to (1, 9) (collision).\n\nIf S0 chooses RIGHT to (2, 8):\nS1 is forced UP to (0, 9).\nS0 @ (2, 8). S1 @ (0, 9).\nThis isolates S1 at the top corner, while S0 gains access slightly further right towards the remaining high apple at (4, 9). S0 seems safer and sets up better territory control.\n\nLet's trace RIGHT (2, 8):\nT19 Prep: S0=(2, 8), S1=(0, 9).\nApple (4, 9) is the next obvious target.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT again to (3, 8), S1 must move DOWN to (0, 8).\nS0 is progressing towards (4, 9) much faster than S1 is contained, and S1 is now restricted to the far left edge of the board.\n\nIf S0 moves UP (1, 9):\nT19 Prep: S0=(1, 9), S1=(0, 9).\n$B_0$ neck is (1, 8). $B_1$ neck is (0, 8).\nS0 options: LEFT (0, 9) (collision), RIGHT (2, 9), DOWN (1, 8).\nS1 options: RIGHT (1, 9) (collision), DOWN (0, 8), UP (0, 10 - dead).\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (1, 8), S1 moves DOWN to (0, 8). We regress slightly but stay safe.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (2, 9), S1 moves DOWN to (0, 8). S0 continues gaining ground towards (4, 9).\n\nComparing RIGHT (2, 8) vs UP (1, 9):\nRIGHT (2, 8) forces S1 into a very confined space (0, 9) and allows S0 better access to the middle of the top edge, setting up a clear path to (4, 9).\nUP (1, 9) keeps the confrontation tight along the top wall.\n\nI prefer the spread generated by moving RIGHT, as it leverages S1's near-suicide implied move last turn to establish territorial advantage.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue pushing right/inward towards the remaining high apple (4, 9), using the restricted movement of S1 now confined to the left edge.\n\nRIGHT\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN NOTE**\nMove RIGHT to (2, 8). This forces S1 further into confinement at (0, 9) or collision. S0 establishes control on the top edge, enabling a direct approach to Apple (4, 9) on subsequent turns while S1 is bottlenecked. If S1 moves to (0, 9), S0 focuses on (3, 8) then (4, 9).\nRIGHT",

Length remains 6 (tail (5, 6) drops).\n**Checking (0, 9) for Apple:** No apple at (0, 9). Length remains 4 (tail (0, 5) drops).\n\n**S0 Collision Check at (2, 8):**\n1. Board Exit: Safe (0-9 range).\n2. Self Collision: Neck is (1, 8). (2, 8) is not (1, 8). Safe.\n3. Enemy Collision: S1 head is at (0, 8). (2, 8) != (0, 8). Safe.\n\n**S1 Collision Check at (0, 9):** (Based on S1 moving UP)\n1. Board Exit: Safe.\n2. Self Collision: Neck is (0, 8). (0, 9) is not (0, 8). Safe.\n3. Enemy Collision: S0 head is at (2, 8). (0, 9) != (2, 8). Safe.\n\n**Status after predicted move:**\nS0 @ (2, 8). S1 @ (0, 9).\nS0 is closer to Apple (4, 9). S1 is effectively trapped on the left edge near the top corner.\n\n**Current Turn (T19) Move Selection from (2, 8):**\nGoal: Advance towards (4, 9) safely.\n\nS0 Move Options from (2, 8):\n1. UP (2, 9): Next target is (4, 9). Safe from self (neck is (1, 8)). Safe from S1 head ((0, 9)).\n2. DOWN (2, 7): Hits body segment (2, 7). DEAD.\n3. LEFT (1, 8): Hits neck (1, 8). DEAD.\n4. RIGHT (3, 8): Safe from self (neck is (1, 8)). Safe from S1 head ((0, 9)).\n\nS0 Safe Moves: UP (2, 9) or RIGHT (3, 8).\n\n**Analysis Comparison:**\n*   **Move UP to (2, 9):** Puts S0 directly adjacent to S1 at (0, 9).\n    *   Next turn prediction (T20): S0 @ (2, 9). S1's only safe move is DOWN to (0, 8).\n    *   S0 faces (1, 9), (3, 9), (2, 8). S0 can move RIGHT to (3, 9) or DOWN to (2, 8). Moving RIGHT gets closer to (4, 9). This keeps pressure on S1 while advancing.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 8):** Advances toward A(4, 9) but leaves vertical space open.\n    *   Next turn prediction (T20): S0 @ (3, 8). S1's only safe move is UP to (0, 10) (DEAD) or DOWN to (0, 8). S1 must move DOWN to (0, 8).\n    *   S0 faces (4, 8), (2, 8), (3, 7) [body]. S0 can move RIGHT to (4, 8), securing the path to (4, 9) next turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT (3, 8) seems strategically superior because it forces S1 into a difficult situation on the subsequent turn (T20).\nIf S0 moves to (3, 8), S1 at (0, 9) has neighbors (0, 8) (neck) and (1, 9) (empty). S1 *must* move DOWN to (0, 8) to survive, as UP leads off board, and RIGHT into (1, 9) is safe, but if S0 moves DOWN to (2, 8), S1 is forced into position to be trapped later. If S1 moves RIGHT to (1, 9), S0 can move to (4, 8) and ignore S1.\n\nLet's verify S1's best move from (0, 9), assuming S0 moves to (3, 8):\nS1 Safe moves from (0, 9):\n1. DOWN (0, 8): Hits neck (0, 8). DEAD. (If S1 stays put, it dies). **Wait: Neck is (0, 8). S1 cannot move DOWN.**\n2. UP (0, 10): Off board. DEAD.\n3. LEFT (-1, 9): Off board. DEAD.\n4. RIGHT (1, 9): Safe from self. Safe from S0 head (3, 8).\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (3, 8), **S1 is forced to move RIGHT to (1, 9) or die.**\n\nNew Predicted State (T20 Start): S0 @ (3, 8). S1 @ (1, 9).\nS0 is now perfectly positioned to capture (4, 9) next turn by moving RIGHT to (4, 8) or UP to (3, 9).\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (2, 9) now:\nS1 must move DOWN to (0, 8).\nNew Predicted State: S0 @ (2, 9). S1 @ (0, 8).\nS0 can capture (4, 9) by moving UP/RIGHT -> (3, 9) -> (4, 9) over two turns. S1 is essentially stuck in a corner segment near the bottom for a few turns.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are excellent, but RIGHT immediately leverages S1's impending forced move to gain ground toward the apple (4, 9) while keeping S1 contained. If S1 moves to (1, 9), it is now adjacent to our path.\n\nLet's stick to the plan that created the greatest immediate restriction on S1 in the previous turn, which was pushing Right, and continue leveraging that spatial advantage. Moving RIGHT to (3, 8) maintains the pressure and sets up the capture of the top apple in T20.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move RIGHT towards the apple at (4, 9). If S1 moves to (1, 9), S0 will move to (4, 8) next turn to secure the apple position. If S1 manages to move elsewhere (unlikely based on analysis), S0 still advances effectively.\nRIGHT",

(4, 8) is safe from self. S1 Head is at (1, 9). (4, 8) is safe from S1 head.\n    *   S1 Move Prediction: Since S0 moved right, S1 must reconsider its forced move. S1 @ (1, 9) is now considering moves against S0 @ (4, 8).\n        *   S1 DOWN to (1, 8): Safe from S0 head (4, 8). (1, 8) is S0 body. **S1 Dies.** (S1 neck/body check: (1, 8) is next to head (1, 9), but (1, 8) is adjacent to S0 tail segment $(2, 8), (1, 8)$ from T19). Ah, wait, S0 BODY $B_0 = \\{(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)\\}$. Yes, **(1, 8) is part of S0's body.**\n        *   S1 RIGHT to (2, 9): Safe from S0 head (4, 8). This is a viable escape move for S1, closer to A(4, 9).\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 9): New state S0@(4, 8), S1@(2, 9). S0 is next to A(4, 9), S1 is next to A(4, 9). S0 gets the apple next turn if S1 allows it or if S0 reaches it first.\n\n2.  **S0 $\\to$ UP to (3, 9)** (Alternative path, close to A(4, 9))\n    *   S0 Safety Check: Neck is (2, 8). (3, 9) is safe from self. S1 Head is at (1, 9). (3, 9) is safe from S1 head.\n    *   S1 Move Prediction: S1 @ (1, 9) responding to S0 moving to (3, 9).\n        *   S1 DOWN to (1, 8): Hits S0 body @ (1, 8). **S1 Dies.**\n        *   S1 RIGHT to (2, 9): Safe from S0 head (3, 9). (2, 9) is adjacent to S0 head.\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 9): New state S0@(3, 9), S1@(2, 9). They are adjacent, chasing A(4, 9).\n\n**Optimal Strategy:**\nThe prediction from the previous turn indicated S1 was forced to move RIGHT to (1, 9) if we moved RIGHT last turn.\nIf we choose RIGHT (4, 8) now, S1's (1, 9) position leads to it dying if it moves DOWN (1, 8) is our body segment. If S1 moves RIGHT (2, 9), it maintains proximity to the apple but S0 is in a better position (4, 8 vs 2, 9) to grab the apple A(4, 9) on T21.\n\nIf we choose UP (3, 9) now, S1's (1, 9) position leads to it dying if it moves DOWN (1, 8) is our body segment. If S1 moves RIGHT (2, 9), S0 gains a slight advantage being further along the X-axis path to (4, 9).\n\nBoth RIGHT (4, 8) and UP (3, 9) lead to S1 being in a very tight spot, likely forcing S1 to move RIGHT to (2, 9) to survive. Moving RIGHT to (4, 8) puts us exactly one step closer to the apple (4, 9) along the X-axis, while UP only moves one step along the Y-axis. Since the apple is at (4, 9), prioritizing the X-coordinate seems slightly better for a direct path.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (4, 8), and S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 9):\nT21: S0 @ (4, 8). S1 @ (2, 9). A @ (4, 9).\nS0 moves UP to (4, 9) and gets the apple! S1 is blocked by S0's new body segment if it tries to cross the path. This is a guaranteed apple gain.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (3, 9), and S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 9):\nT21: S0 @ (3, 9). S1 @ (2, 9). A @ (4, 9).\nS0 moves RIGHT to (4, 9) and gets the apple! This also guarantees the apple gain.\n\nSince both lead to grabbing the top apple on the next turn (T21), choosing RIGHT (4, 8) maintains the approach path established previously, moving along the edge of the board towards the apple's X coordinate.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move RIGHT to (4, 8). This ensures that regardless of S1's survival move (likely RIGHT to (2, 9)), S0 will be able to move directly onto A(4, 9) on Turn 21, increasing the score to 7 and growing the snake, while likely trapping S1 near the top edge.\n\nRIGHT",

If S1 moved RIGHT to (2, 9), that is consistent.\nSince A(4, 9) is still present, this means S0 did *not* reach or move onto (4, 9) on T20, and S1 did not move onto (4, 9) on T20 either.\n\nMy goal for T21 is to immediately acquire A(4, 9).\n\n**Target Apple:** A(4, 9).\nCurrent Position: H0 = (4, 8).\n\nIf I move UP: H0 $\\to$ (4, 9). This directly lands on the apple.\n\n**Move Safety Check (UP to (4, 9)):**\n1.  **Off Board?** (4, 9) is safe on a 10x10 board (0-9).\n2.  **Self Collision?** My body tail is (3, 7). Neck is (3, 8). (4, 9) is not adjacent to any body parts other than the movement path. Safe.\n3.  **Enemy Head Collision?** Enemy Head H1 = (2, 9). (4, 9) is safe from H1.\n4.  **Head-on Collision?** No way to determine S1's planned move yet, but if S1 planned to move to (4, 9), they would die anyway because I reach it first.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 9), I eat the apple, gain a segment, and my score increases to 7.\n\n**Enemy S1 Prediction (S1 @ (2, 9)):**\nApples remaining at (3, 1), (3, 4), (7, 0), (6, 5). (4, 9) is gone.\nS1 needs to survive and look for food.\nPossible moves for S1:\n*   UP to (2, 10): Off board (Dies).\n*   DOWN to (2, 8): (2, 8) is S0 body. (Dies).\n*   LEFT to (1, 9): (1, 9) is S1 body. (Dies).\n*   RIGHT to (3, 9): Safe. Adjacent to where S0 just moved from ((4, 8) is now body). This is the only safe surviving move.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving UP to (4, 9) guarantees an apple collection and growth, and safely moves my head away from S1's likely next position of (3, 9) (since S1's options (2, 10), (2, 8), (1, 9) all result in death). Even if S1 somehow planned to move to (4, 9), I reach it first, and S1 dies by hitting my now-larger body segment at (4, 8) (which becomes part of the body).\n\nThis move is optimal: immediate gain, safe, and forces the opponent into a very constrained position (if my analysis of their move options is correct).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Focus on Apple (6, 5) next, as (3, 1) and (3, 4) are further away and (7, 0) is currently blocked by the relative position to S1. Maintain proximity to the center/right side of the board.\n\nUP",

Since the score increased in the description to 7, this move was successful and I ate the apple. (Note: The provided board state at the start of T22 reflects the $After$ move state. The head listed is (4, 9), confirming the UP move was executed and successful). My snake grew, so its effective length/body has advanced.\n\nMy new state (S0): Head (4, 9). Body: [(4, 8) (new), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7) (new tail segment if growth occurred by 1)].\nLet's reconstruct the body precisely based on the logic of growing by 1 (eating (4, 9)):\nPrevious Head (4, 8) is now segment 1.\nThe old tail segment (3, 7) is dropped *unless* an apple was eaten. Since the score went up (7 apples recorded), I ate the apple.\nS0 Body (Length 7 -> 8): $H_0 = (4, 9)$. New Body: $[(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)]$ (assuming the tail didn't move/was still at (3,7) before consumption, the new tail position depends on the previous turn mechanics\u2014since the previous state showed length 7, and the current state shows length 8 based on the provided list structure, I assume the body listed reflects the new length).\n\n*Re-evaluating Board State vs Text:*\nBoard State listed:\nHead: (4, 9)\nBody: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7)] (Length 7 listed here)\nScore: 7 apples collected.\n\nIf the score is 7, and the body list has 7 segments (total length 8), then the collection of the apple at (4, 9) on T21 resulted in the new head (4, 9) AND the body remaining as 7 segments (i.e., the tail segment (3, 7) was removed implicitly, OR the body list provided *only* lists the segments excluding the head). Snake body lists are usually Head:Body Segments (Total Length = 1 + Body Segments).\nIf Length = 7 (Head + 6 segments defined):\nS0 T20 Head was (3, 8). S0 T21 Head is (4, 9). S0 Score 7.\nIf S0 did not grow on the turn before T21, its length was 7 (Head + 6 segments). Eating an apple makes it Length 8 (Head + 7 segments). The provided list has 6 segments listed after the head, totaling 7 blocks (Length 7).\n\nGiven the score T21=7 and the provided T22 state shows H=(4, 9) and Body Length 7 list:\nThe snake grew to length 8 on T21 (Head + 7 segments). The list provided for T22 must be interpreted as the snake structure after eating.\nIf S0 T20 Tail was $T_{20}$. S0 T21 move UP to (4, 9).\nIf the list [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7)] represents the body *excluding* the new head (4, 9), then the length is 8. The tail is (3, 7).\n\nEnemy S1 Post T21: Head H1 = (3, 9). Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]. Length 4. Score 3.\nThis confirms S1 moved RIGHT to (3, 9) on T21 (from H1=(2, 9)) and did *not* eat an apple (it was not near one).\n\n**Target for T22:**\nApples remaining: (3, 1), (3, 4), (7, 0), (6, 5), (0, 0).\nClosest apples to H0=(4, 9):\n1. (6, 5) via moves like R, R, D, D, D, R. Distance $\\approx 5$ moves.\n2. (3, 4) via moves like L, D, D, D. Distance $\\approx 4$ moves.\n\n(3, 4) seems slightly more direct. Target $A_2 = (3, 4)$.\n\n**Safety Check for T22:**\nH0 = (4, 9). Tail is likely (3, 7) (the last element in the list structure provided).\n\n1.  **Try LEFT to (3, 9):**\n    *   Collision with S1 Head (3, 9)? YES. Head-on collision if S1 stays put.\n    *   S1's next move prediction: H1=(3, 9). S1 will look for food or safety.\n        *   S1 options: UP (Off board), DOWN (to (3, 8) -> hits S0 body), LEFT (to (2, 9) -> hits S1 body), RIGHT (to (4, 9) -> hits S0 head/self collision depending on exact tail movement).\n        *   If S1 moves DOWN to (3, 8): (3, 8) is S0 body. S1 dies.\n        *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 9): (4, 9) is S0 head. Head-on collision OR S1 dies hitting my head.\n        *   If S1 moves LEFT to (2, 9): (2, 9) is S1 body. S1 dies.\n        *   S1 must move DOWN to (3, 8) if it wants to survive by trying to eat my segment, but (3, 8) is occupied by S0 body. Wait, S1 has no safe move if S0 moves LEFT to (3, 9), as S0 lands on the head H1=(3, 9). If H0 $\\to$ (3, 9), S1 dies instantly. This is a strong move if S1 has no safe move *anyway*.\n\nLet's analyze S1 safety based on H1=(3, 9) and S0 H0=(4, 9), S0 Body includes (3, 8) confirmed from the list.\nS1 available moves from (3, 9):\na) UP (3, 10): OFF BOARD.\nb) DOWN (3, 8): HITS S0 Body (3, 8). S1 dies.\nc) LEFT (2, 9): HITS S1 Body (2, 9). S1 dies.\nd) RIGHT (4, 9): HITS S0 Head (4, 9) if S0 moves RIGHT. If S0 moves LEFT to (3, 9), then (4, 9) is currently S0 Head. If S1 moves to (4, 9), it crashes into S0 Head unless S0 Head moves there.\n\nSince S1 has NO safe move from (3, 9) based on S0 being stationary *or* moving to (4, 9) or (3, 8), moving LEFT to (3, 9) guarantees S1's death, as I land on its head. This is highly favorable.\n\n2.  **Try RIGHT to (5, 9):**\n    *   Safe from self-collision and boundaries.\n    *   If S1 moves DOWN to (3, 8), safe. If S1 moves LEFT to (2, 9), dies. If S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 9), or stays at (3, 9).\n    *   If S0 moves RIGHT to (5, 9) and S1 moves DOWN to (3, 8), then S1 survives and is moving towards the center field.\n\n3.  **Try DOWN to (4, 8):**\n    *   (4, 8) is S0 Body (new segment 1). COLLISION. Dies. Invalid move.\n\n4.  **Try UP:** (4, 10). Off Board. Invalid move.\n\n**Comparing LEFT vs STAYING SAFE BUT NOT KILLING S1:**\nMove LEFT (to 3, 9) kills S1 immediately because S1 has zero safe moves from (3, 9) given the current S0 structure that blocks (3, 8) and S0 occupies (4, 9) or is moving there.\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (3, 9): H1=(3, 9) is targeted. S1 must move.\nS1 options: a) UP (off board). b) DOWN (to 3, 8, hits S0 body). c) LEFT (to 2, 9, hits S1 body). d) RIGHT (to 4, 9, hits H0).\nSince H0 moves simultaneously to (3, 9), if any of S1's target cells are occupied by S0 (head or body) OR are invalid (off board/self collision), S1 dies trying to move there.\nIf S0 moves to (3, 9), S1 attempting to move causes collision or self-destruction regardless of its choice. S1 dies.\n\nThis guarantees a 1 vs 0 scenario unless the move itself somehow kills S0.\nS0 move: LEFT to (3, 9).\n(3, 9) is not occupied by S0 body. S0 body tail is (3, 7) or (4, 7) depending on growth interpretation, but it certainly doesn't include (3, 9).\nS0 is safe by moving LEFT.\n\nConclusion: Moving LEFT guarantees the elimination of Snake #1. This is the highest priority move unless it causes self-destruction, which it does not. After this move, I win immediately as I am the only snake remaining.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Win the game by eliminating the opponent. Acquire any remaining apples if needed, but winning takes precedence.\n\nLEFT",
