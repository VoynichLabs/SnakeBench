          "rationale": "**Long-term strategy note for the next few turns:**  \nWe're very early in the game (turn 0) with no apples collected. Our snake (head at (4,0)) is positioned near the bottom-left of the board. The enemy snake (head at (6,2)) is also near the bottom center. There are many apples scattered across the board, but the immediate priority is to survive and start accumulating apples. Since the enemy is also starting at zero apples, we need to outmaneuver them over the long term. The board is large (10x10), so we have room to maneuver. I should aim to move toward clusters of apples while keeping escape routes open. The closest apples to us are at (4,1) (directly above) and (9,0) (far right on the bottom row). (4,1) is just one step up and is safe (no body parts there). Moving to (4,1) will also block the enemy from reaching that apple if they try to go for it (though they are at (6,2), not directly adjacent). However, we must consider the enemy's possible moves. The enemy could move up, down, left, or right. If we move up to (4,1), we might be safe unless the enemy moves left and down to (3,2) or something, but that's not a direct threat. Actually, we need to think about the enemy's head movement: they might try to cut us off or compete for apples. Since it's turn 0, the enemy likely also wants to grow quickly. We should prioritize getting the first apple to gain a size advantage. The apple at (4,1) is the safest and closest. Let's go for that. After eating that apple, our body will be at (4,0) (tail) and head at (4,1). Then we can consider moving to other apples.\n\nNow, evaluate the move choices for turn 0:\n\n1. **UP:** From (4,0) to (4,1). This cell is empty (no snake bodies, no apple? Actually there is an apple at (4,1) according to the list: apples include (4,1). Yes, the apple list includes (4,1). So moving up will eat the apple, grow by 1, and we'll have body at (4,0). Is it safe? Check immediate death conditions: (4,1) is within board (0-9). No own body (currently none). Enemy body is none. Enemy head at (6,2) is not moving into our body (our body will be at (4,0) after move). Also, if enemy moves left and down to (5,1) or something, that's not our body. But we also need to consider head-on collision: if enemy's head moves to (4,1) at the same time, both die. Is that possible? Enemy head at (6,2). To reach (4,1) in one move, they would need to move left 2 and down 1, which is not possible in one move (only one step in cardinal direction). So they cannot reach (4,1) this turn. Therefore, UP is safe and yields an apple.\n\n2. **DOWN:** From (4,0) to (4,-1) -> outside board (y=-1) -> die. Not allowed.\n\n3. **LEFT:** From (4,0) to (3,0). Check board: (3,0) appears empty? The board shows row 0: \" . . . . 1 . . . . A\" where columns 0-9. Column 3 is the fourth character: let's map the row 0 string: \" . . . . 1 . . . . A\" Actually the board representation: \nRow 9: \". A A . . A . A . .\"\nRow 8: \". . . A . . . . . .\"\nRow 7: \". . A . . . . . . .\"\nRow 6: \". . . . . . . . A .\"\nRow 5: \". . . . A . . . . .\"\nRow 4: \". . . A . . . A . .\"\nRow 3: \". . . . A . . . . A\"\nRow 2: \". . . . . . 0 . . .\"\nRow 1: \". . . . A . . . . A\"\nRow 0: \". . . . 1 . . . . A\"\n\nLet's index columns 0-9. For row 0, the characters: \nposition: 0:'.',1:'.',2:'.',3:'.',4:'1',5:'.',6:'.',7:'.',8:'.',9:'A'\nSo (3,0) is column 3, row 0: character '.' (empty). So LEFT is to (3,0). That's within board, no body, no apple (apple at (9,0) far right). It's safe immediate death-wise. However, moving left reduces our x, moving away from many apples. The apple at (4,1) is close but we wouldn't get it. Also, we might get trapped if we go left too much? But (3,0) is open. Could be safe but not optimal for apple collection.\n\n4. **RIGHT:** From (4,0) to (5,0). Check (5,0): row 0, column 5 is '.' (empty). Safe immediate. But apple at (4,1) is still reachable later? Possibly. However, moving right moves away from (4,1) apple, but towards (9,0) apple which is farther. Right now, (4,1) is the closest apple.\n\nComparing UP vs LEFT vs RIGHT: UP gives an apple immediately, which is advantageous because it grows our snake (size becomes 2) and gives us a point. Also, it's safe as argued. LEFT and RIGHT are safe but don't give an apple this turn. Since we want to maximize apples, UP seems best.\n\nBut we must consider the enemy's move. The enemy might try to move towards us or cut us off. The enemy at (6,2) could move left to (5,2), down to (6,1), up to (6,3), or right to (7,2). None of these threaten our head at (4,0) immediately. However, if we move UP to (4,1), our body will be at (4,0). If the enemy moves left to (5,2) and then later down, they might threaten us. But that's future turns. For now, we should secure the apple.\n\nAlso, we need to consider if moving UP could set us up for a trap later. After eating the apple, our snake will be head at (4,1), body at (4,0). The board around (4,1) is mostly open. Upwards, (4,2) is empty? Row 2: \". . . . . . 0 . . .\" column 4 is '.' (since row 2: columns: 0:'.',1:'.',2:'.',3:'.',4:'.',5:'.',6:'0',7:'.',8:'.',9:'.'? Actually the string is \". . . . . . 0 . . .\" which likely means columns 0-9: 0:'.',1:'.',2:'.',3:'.',4:'.',5:'.',6:'0',7:'.',8:'.',9:'.'. So (4,2) is '.' empty. Good.\n\nWe should also note that the enemy snake has no body yet, so no immediate collision risk.\n\nThus, the optimal move is UP.\n\nWe'll output UP as the final answerUP",

          "rationale": "We're at turn 1. Our snake (ID 1) is at (4,1) as head, with body segment at (4,0). Apples collected: 1. Enemy snake #0 is at (7,2) with no body. Apples are scattered. Our goal is to continue growing safely while staying ahead of the enemy. The immediate board shows an apple at (4,3) directly above us. Moving up to (4,2) is empty, then (4,3) has an apple. We should aim for that apple, but we must consider the enemy's possible moves. The enemy at (7,2) could move left, right, up, down, but they are far enough. However, we need to avoid head-on collisions if they move towards us. But (4,2) is safe for now. Let's check all moves:\n\nUP: to (4,2) \u2013 within board, no apple (apple is at (4,3)). Our body is at (4,0) and (4,1)? Actually after eating apple last turn, our body is [(4,0)]? Wait, we moved up to (4,1) and ate apple, so after turn 0 our head is (4,1) and body is [(4,0)]. So currently head (4,1), body [(4,0)]. Moving up to (4,2) would leave body as [(4,1), (4,0)]? Actually after moving, the new head becomes (4,2), and the previous head becomes body, so body would be [(4,1), (4,0)]. (4,2) is empty. No immediate death. It's safe. Also, (4,2) is not occupied by enemy or their future head? Enemy currently at (7,2). If they move left to (6,2) or up to (7,3) etc., they could potentially reach (4,2) only if they move many steps, not this turn. So safe.\n\nDOWN: to (4,0) \u2013 that's our current tail? Actually body is at (4,0). Moving down into our own body is moving backwards? Our head is at (4,1), down would go to (4,0) which is occupied by our own body segment. That is moving directly backwards into our own body, which is prohibited and would cause death. So DOWN is illegal.\n\nLEFT: to (3,1) \u2013 check board row 1: \". . . . 1 . . . . A\" \u2013 columns: 0:'.',1:'.',2:'.',3:'.',4:'1',5:'.',6:'.',7:'.',8:'.',9:'A'. So (3,1) is column 3, row 1: '.' empty. Also, is there an apple? Not listed, but apples include (3,8) etc. So empty. Safe. This moves left towards some apples? (3,8) is far, but (4,3) apple is still reachable. LEFT is safe.\n\nRIGHT: to (5,1) \u2013 row 1 column 5 is '.' empty. Safe. No apple. Moves away from (4,3) but could be useful later.\n\nWe should consider that moving UP directly to (4,2) brings us closer to the apple at (4,3) and keeps options open. Also, we need to think about the enemy's potential to cut us off. The enemy is at (7,2). They might go for apples elsewhere. We should prioritize apples that are relatively safe and not contested heavily. The apple at (4,3) is close and seems uncontested for now.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that if we move UP, our next move could go to (4,3) to eat that apple, growing again. That would give us another point and increase our size to 3. That seems strong. But we need to ensure we don't get trapped. After eating (4,3), our body would be at (4,1) and (4,2) (assuming we eat apple at (4,3)). Then we could plan to move towards other apples like (3,4), (2,7), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT or RIGHT might lead us to other apple clusters. But (4,3) is the closest apple, and we should get it before the enemy possibly goes near. The enemy at (7,2) might aim for apples like (7,4), (8,6), etc. They are far from (4,3).\n\nThus, UP is the best move: safe, progresses towards an apple, and keeps our path open.\n\nCheck for any immediate collision with enemy if they move into our body? Our body will be at (4,0) and (4,1) after moving. Enemy head at (7,2) cannot reach those in one move. If they move left to (6,2), that's not our body. So no collision.\n\nAlso, consider head-on collision: if enemy moves up to (7,3) or down to (7,1), no conflict. If they move left to (6,2), fine. They cannot reach (4,2) this turn.\n\nTherefore, UP is safe and optimal.\n\nFinal answer: UP.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "My head is at (4, 2), body at (4, 1), tail at (4, 0). Enemy snake #0 at (7, 3) with no body. Apples are everywhere. My last move was UP (from (4,1) to (4,2)? Wait, the last move pick was UP, and the rationale says we were at (4,1) and moved UP to (4,2). But in the board state, my snake's head is (4,2) and body is (4,1). That matches: after moving UP to (4,2), we ate an apple? No, the apple at (4,3) is still there. Did we eat an apple? The scores show I have 1 apple collected. That matches the initial description: \"Your snake (ID: 1) apples: 1\". The apple at (4,3) is still on the board, so I haven't eaten it yet. So my head is (4,2), body (4,1), tail (4,0). Good.\n\nNow turn 2. I need to choose a move. Let's evaluate options.\n\nFirst, check if any move is immediately fatal.\n\nCurrent head: (4,2). Body: (4,1) and (4,0) (tail). So the cell behind my head is (4,1) (occupied by body). That's backwards. So moving DOWN to (4,1) is moving directly into my own body -> death. So DOWN is fatal.\n\nUP: to (4,3). Check board: row 3, column 4. According to board state, row 3: \". . . . A . . 0 . A\". That's (3,0) '.', (3,1) '.', (3,2) '.', (3,3) '.', (3,4) 'A', (3,5) '.', (3,6) '.', (3,7) '0', (3,8) '.', (3,9) 'A'. So (4,3) is (x=4,y=3) -> that's column 4, row 3: 'A'. Apple is there. That's good. But we need to check if moving into an apple is safe: yes, we grow, and the apple disappears. However, we must also consider that the enemy snake #0 is at (7,3). If we move UP to (4,3), and enemy moves left to (6,3) or something, no collision. But if enemy moves left to (5,3) or up to (7,4) etc., they won't hit us. However, there is also the possibility of head-on collision if enemy moves into (4,3) at the same time? Enemy is at (7,3). To reach (4,3) in one move, they'd need to move left 3 steps, impossible. So safe.\n\nBut also check if (4,3) is occupied by any other snake's body? Enemy body is none. So safe.\n\nNow LEFT: to (3,2). Row 2? Actually board shows row 2: \". . . . 1 . . . . .\" but that's from earlier? Wait, the board state is given as a picture with rows from 9 down to 0. Let's parse row 2 (y=2). According to the board:\n\nRow 9: 9 . A A . . A . A . .\nRow 8: 8 . . . A . . . . . .\nRow 7: 7 . . A . . . . . . .\nRow 6: 6 . . . . . . . . A A\nRow 5: 5 . . . . A . . . . .\nRow 4: 4 . . . A . . . A . .\nRow 3: 3 . . . . A . . 0 . A\nRow 2: 2 . . . . 1 . . . . .\nRow 1: 1 . . . . T . . . . A\nRow 0: 0 . . . . . . . . . A\n\nSo row 2 (y=2) is: columns 0-9: . . . . 1 . . . . . \nThus (3,2) is column 3, row 2: '.' empty. No apple. No snake. Safe.\n\nRIGHT: to (5,2). Row 2 column 5: '.' empty. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is fatal, UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow among safe moves, we need to choose one that increases chance of eating apples and keeps future options open. Also consider enemy snake's move.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (7,3) with no body. That means it's just a head. It can move in four directions. We need to anticipate its potential moves to avoid future collisions. It might go for apples like (7,4) or (8,6) or (9,6) etc. There are many apples. We should avoid moving into positions where enemy could cut us off.\n\nOur head is at (4,2). Apples near us: (4,3) directly above, (3,4) is at (3,4), (2,7) is far, (3,8) far, (4,5) is at (4,5), etc. Also there are apples at (2,9), (5,9), etc.\n\nIf we go UP to (4,3), we eat the apple at (4,3). That grows us to length 3 (head (4,3), body (4,2) and (4,1) after movement? Actually after moving up, our body becomes (previous head) (4,2) and then (4,1). So we'll have body segments at (4,2) and (4,1). Tail remains at (4,0) unless we grow? Wait, we ate an apple, so we grow by one segment: the tail does NOT move this turn (since we ate). So after eating, our body will be: new head (4,3), body includes old head (4,2) and old body (4,1) and old tail (4,0). So length becomes 4. Good.\n\nBut we need to consider that after eating, we might be slightly more vulnerable because our body is longer, but still manageable.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3,2), no apple. Then next turn we could aim for (3,4) or (4,3) perhaps. But (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3) which is empty, (4,3) is apple. However, moving LEFT moves us away from the immediate apple at (4,3). The enemy might also go for that apple? Possibly, but enemy is far.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (5,2), no apple. That moves us towards the right side where there are many apples: (5,9), (7,9), (8,6), (9,0), (9,1), (9,3), (9,6). But that's far.\n\nGiven that we have an apple right above us, it's logical to take it. That gives us a point and length growth. Also, moving up keeps us in the lower center of the board, leaving options to move left/right/up later.\n\nNow consider the enemy's potential moves. They are at (7,3). They could move UP to (7,4) (apple at (7,4)? Yes, there is an apple at (7,4) according to the list: apples include (7,4). So they might eat that apple. That would be good for them. They could also move LEFT to (6,3) or RIGHT to (8,3) or DOWN to (7,2). There's an apple at (9,3) but that's far. They might not come near us.\n\nWe should also consider if there's any risk of the enemy moving into our body later. Our body will be along x=4, y=0,1,2 if we go UP. That's far from (7,3). So unlikely.\n\nNow, what about future trapping? If we go UP, we'll be at (4,3) with body extending down. Then we could go LEFT to (3,3), RIGHT to (5,3), UP to (4,4), DOWN to (4,2) but (4,2) is body? Actually after eating, our body will be (4,2) and (4,1) and (4,0). So moving DOWN to (4,2) would be moving into our own body, which is death. So after eating, DOWN is fatal. That's similar to now. But we can still move LEFT, RIGHT, UP. So options remain.\n\nIf we go LEFT or RIGHT now, we don't get an apple immediately, but we might set up for a longer-term path. However, the apple at (4,3) is very close and safe. It's likely we should take it.\n\nBut wait: the enemy might also move into (4,3) if they go up two steps? No, they can only move one step per turn. So they can't reach (4,3) this turn. So it's safe.\n\nAlso, consider if moving UP might put us in a position where the enemy could trap us later. For example, if we go UP and then the enemy goes to (4,2) next turn? But after we eat, (4,2) will be our body. So if enemy moves into (4,2), they would hit our body and die. That's actually good for us. So if enemy moves left from (7,3) to (6,3) then maybe later to (5,3) etc., they might try to approach our body. But we can move away.\n\nOverall, UP seems the best: safe, gets an apple, grows us.\n\nNow, is there any downside? Possibly, if the enemy decides to move left and then eventually cut us off. But we have many other apples.\n\nAnother consideration: the board has many apples, but we need to be careful not to get trapped in a corner. Our current position is (4,2), which is near the bottom left quadrant. The bottom left corner is (0,0). We are at (4,2), so we have room to move left/right/up. Down is not an option because it's our own body. So we have three safe directions. If we go UP, after eating, we'll have body along x=4, y=0,1,2. That might create a corridor. We should plan to eventually move left or right to avoid being stuck.\n\nBut I think UP is fine.\n\nNow, the instructions say: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I should include a plan. But the final answer must be just the move. I can include a plan before that.\n\nLet's draft a plan.\n\nPlan: \"Take the apple at (4,3) now to grow. After eating, our body will block (4,2) and (4,1), leaving left, right, and up as safe moves. Next, consider moving towards the apple cluster at (3,4) or (4,5). Keep an eye on enemy snake #0; they may go for apples at (7,4) or (8,6). Avoid moving into positions where enemy could head-on collision.\"\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nNow, for the move: UP.\n\nBut let's double-check: is moving UP to (4,3) safe from any other constraints? What about the apple at (4,3) being occupied by an enemy head? No. What about the enemy moving into (4,3) simultaneously? As said, impossible. What about moving onto an apple that is also occupied by another snake's body? No.\n\nAlso, check if moving UP would cause us to go off the board? (4,3) is within 0-9, yes.\n\nThus, UP is safe and optimal.\n\nI'll output the plan and then theUP",

Snake #0 has head at (8,4), body at [(7,4)], and 1 apple. Apples are listed at: (1,9), (7,9), (3,8), (2,7), (2,9), (4,5), (9,0), (8,6), (9,1), (5,9), (3,4), (9,3), (9,6), (8,1), (4,6). Board is 10x10 from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nBoard state representation (9 to 0 rows, 0 to 9 columns):\nRow 9: . A A . . A . A . .  -> (0,9) ., (1,9) A, (2,9) A, (3,9) ., (4,9) ., (5,9) A, (6,9) ., (7,9) A, (8,9) ., (9,9) .\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .  -> (0,8) ., (1,8) ., (2,8) ., (3,8) A, (4,8) ., (5,8) ., (6,8) ., (7,8) ., (8,8) ., (9,8) .\nRow 7: . . A . . . . . . .  -> (0,7) ., (1,7) ., (2,7) A, (3,7) ., (4,7) ., (5,7) ., (6,7) ., (7,7) ., (8,7) ., (9,7) .\nRow 6: . . . . A . . . A A  -> (0,6) ., (1,6) ., (2,6) ., (3,6) ., (4,6) A, (5,6) ., (6,6) ., (7,6) ., (8,6) A, (9,6) A? Wait, last entry says A A at end, so (8,6) A, (9,6) A? Actually row 6 says: . . . . A . . . A A. So positions: (0,6) ., (1,6) ., (2,6) ., (3,6) ., (4,6) A, (5,6) ., (6,6) ., (7,6) ., (8,6) A, (9,6) A? But it says \"A A\" at end, meaning (8,6) and (9,6) both A? However the apple list includes (8,6) and (9,6) but also (9,0), (9,1), etc. Let's check apple list: (1,9), (7,9), (3,8), (2,7), (2,9), (4,5), (9,0), (8,6), (9,1), (5,9), (3,4), (9,3), (9,6), (8,1), (4,6). That includes (4,6), (8,6), (9,6) yes. So row 6: (4,6) A, (8,6) A, (9,6) A. But the board row shows only two A at end, maybe missing one? Actually it says \". . . . A . . . A A\" meaning columns 0-3: .; 4: A; 5: .; 6: .; 7: .; 8: A; 9: A. So (4,6) A, (8,6) A, (9,6) A? Wait (9,6) is column 9, so yes A. So (4,6) is separate. So board row 6 has A at (4,6), (8,6), (9,6). That's fine.\n\nRow 5: . . . . A . . . . .  -> (0,5) ., (1,5) ., (2,5) ., (3,5) ., (4,5) A, (5,5) ., (6,5) ., (7,5) ., (8,5) ., (9,5) .\nRow 4: . . . A 1 . . T 0 .  -> (0,4) ., (1,4) ., (2,4) ., (3,4) A, (4,4) 1 (my head), (5,4) ., (6,4) ., (7,4) T (tail of snake #0? Actually T denotes snake body?), (8,4) 0 (enemy head), (9,4) . . Wait board says: \". . . A 1 . . T 0 .\" meaning columns 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So (7,4) T? T likely represents a body segment? Actually in the board state, \"T\" is used for my body? Let's see: row 4: (3,4) A, (4,4) 1, (7,4) T, (8,4) 0. So T is my tail? But my body is [(4,3), (4,2)], so my tail is (4,2). So (7,4) T is not my body. Perhaps T is just a placeholder for \"something\"? Actually in the board state, they might use \"T\" to denote a snake body segment. In row 4: \". . . A 1 . . T 0 .\" So (7,4) is T, which is the enemy snake #0's body? Enemy body is [(7,4)] indeed. So T likely means \"body segment of snake #0\". But snake #0's body is only (7,4). So T is there. Good.\n\nRow 3: . . . . T . . . . A  -> (0,3) ., (1,3) ., (2,3) ., (3,3) ., (4,3) T? Actually (4,3) is my body? My body includes (4,3). So T might denote my body? But earlier row 4 had T at (7,4) for enemy. Now row 3: \". . . . T . . . . A\" -> (4,3) T? That would be my body. So yes, T is a generic snake body marker. In row 3: (4,3) is T (my body), and (9,3) is A (apple). So board shows T for snake bodies regardless of ID. But we need to be careful: my body is at (4,3) and (4,2). So row 2 should have T at (4,2). Let's see row 2: \". . . . T . . . . .\" -> (4,2) T yes. So board uses T for any snake body. Good.\n\nRow 2: . . . . T . . . . .  -> (0,2) ., (1,2) ., (2,2) ., (3,2) ., (4,2) T (my tail), (5,2) ., (6,2) ., (7,2) ., (8,2) ., (9,2) .\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . A A  -> (0,1) ., (1,1) ., (2,1) ., (3,1) ., (4,1) ., (5,1) ., (6,1) ., (7,1) ., (8,1) A, (9,1) A\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A  -> (0,0) ., (1,0) ., (2,0) ., (3,0) ., (4,0) ., (5,0) ., (6,0) ., (7,0) ., (8,0) ., (9,0) A\n\nAlso note: Enemy snake #0 head at (8,4), body at (7,4). So T at (7,4) is enemy body.\n\nNow, my last move was UP. I need to decide my next move (turn 5). I should consider all four directions from my head (4,4):\n\n- UP to (4,5)\n- DOWN to (4,3)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n- RIGHT to (5,4)\n\nCheck each for immediate death:\n\n1. UP (4,5): (4,5) is an apple? From apple list: (4,5) is indeed an apple. So moving UP would eat apple, grow, no immediate death from apple. Need to check if (4,5) is occupied by any snake body. My body is (4,3) and (4,2) \u2013 not (4,5). Enemy snake #0 body is (7,4) \u2013 not (4,5). So no collision. Also need to consider head-on collision: if enemy head moves into (4,5) at same time, both die. But enemy head is at (8,4). Enemy could move LEFT to (7,4) but that's its body, or UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), RIGHT to (9,4). Could enemy move to (4,5)? That's far away, unlikely in one turn. But we must consider all possibilities. However enemy head is at (8,4), so the only cells it can reach in one move are (8,5), (8,3), (7,4), (9,4). None is (4,5). So no head-on collision. Also, moving UP would bring me closer to apples above: (4,6) is apple, (5,9) apple, etc. But need to consider future. Also note that moving UP from (4,4) to (4,5) means my new tail will be (4,3) because I grew by one apple? Actually when I eat an apple, I grow: the tail does not move forward; the snake becomes longer. So after moving UP to apple, my head becomes (4,5), my body becomes [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]? Wait careful: normally, when moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, and the tail moves one step forward (i.e., the last segment is removed). When eating, the tail does not move; the snake grows by one segment, so the new head is the apple cell, and the body includes the old head and all previous body segments. So after moving UP to (4,5) which has apple, my new head is (4,5), my body will be [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]? But (4,2) is my tail? Actually originally body: head (4,4), body [(4,3), (4,2)]. After moving UP to (4,5) (apple), the new head is (4,5). The old head (4,4) becomes the first body segment. The old body segments shift: (4,3) becomes second body segment, (4,2) becomes third body segment? But since I grew, the tail remains (4,2) and the body length increases by 1. So the body becomes [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]? Actually the head is (4,5), so the body list should be: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2)] from head to tail. So yes, tail stays at (4,2). So after move, my snake occupies (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). That's four cells.\n\n2. DOWN (4,3): (4,3) is currently my own body (since my body is (4,3) and (4,2)). Moving down into (4,3) would be moving directly into my own body, which is illegal and causes death. So DOWN is not allowed.\n\n3. LEFT (3,4): (3,4) is an apple? Apple list includes (3,4). Yes! So LEFT would also eat an apple. Check if (3,4) is occupied: my body is (4,3), (4,2) \u2013 not (3,4). Enemy body (7,4) \u2013 not (3,4). So no collision. Enemy head could move to (3,4)? From (8,4), impossible in one move. So safe from head-on. So LEFT is also a valid move that eats an apple.\n\n4. RIGHT (5,4): (5,4) is empty? Board row 4 shows (5,4) is '.' (from \". . . A 1 . . T 0 .\", so column 5 is '.'). So not an apple. Check if (5,4) is occupied by any snake body: my body not there; enemy body (7,4) not there. So safe. However, we must consider that moving RIGHT may not give immediate benefit, but could lead to future paths.\n\nNow, we also need to consider enemy snake #0's possible moves. Snake #0 head at (8,4), body at (7,4). Possible moves for enemy: UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4) but that's its own body (immediate death), RIGHT to (9,4) (within board). Enemy might choose to avoid death, so likely not LEFT. Could also choose UP or DOWN or RIGHT. We need to anticipate enemy's move to avoid head-on collisions or being trapped. But we don't know what enemy will do. However, we should consider worst-case or most likely. Since enemy has only 1 apple, it may want to grow and survive. It might move towards an apple. Which apples are near enemy? Enemy at (8,4). Nearby apples: (8,6) is apple, (9,6), (8,1), (9,1), (9,0), (9,3), etc. So enemy might move UP to (8,5) heading toward (8,6). Or RIGHT to (9,4) maybe heading to (9,3) or (9,1). Or DOWN to (8,3) which is empty? (8,3) is not an apple; but could lead to other apples. So enemy's move is uncertain.\n\nBut from my perspective, I need to choose a safe move that maximizes my chances. Both UP and LEFT eat apples, so both give me +1 apple. That brings my total to 3 apples. My head moves to a new cell, and I grow. Right now, I have two safe moves that eat apples: UP to (4,5) and LEFT to (3,4). Which is better?\n\nConsider future options: After moving UP to (4,5), my head will be at (4,5). My body will extend to include (4,4). The tail remains (4,2). Apples near (4,5): (4,6) is an apple (just above). (3,8) apple, (2,9) apple, etc. But we need to consider that moving UP may put me closer to many apples in the top-left area. However, there is also an enemy snake at (8,4) and its possible expansion. Also, we need to avoid getting trapped. Currently, my snake is vertical along x=4 from y=2 to y=4. If I move UP to (4,5), the snake becomes longer along x=4. This could potentially block my own movement later if I need to go left or right. But I can still turn. The board is open.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (3,4), my head will be at (3,4). That's an apple. Then my body will be [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]? Wait careful: if I move LEFT to (3,4), that's not adjacent vertically, so my body will be: old head (4,4) becomes first body segment, then (4,3), (4,2). So the snake will be horizontal at head? Actually after moving LEFT, my head is at (3,4), body includes (4,4) to the right, then (4,3) below, then (4,2) below. So the body shape is like a step. This might give more flexibility to move up or down from (3,4) without being constrained by a vertical line. (3,4) is near other apples: (3,8) apple, (2,7) apple, (2,9) apple, (1,9) apple, (5,9) apple. So also good.\n\nNow, consider the enemy's potential to collide with me. If I move UP to (4,5), and enemy moves UP to (8,5), no collision. If enemy moves LEFT to (7,4) (which is its body, so likely not), but if it did, no collision. If enemy moves RIGHT to (9,4), fine. If enemy moves DOWN to (8,3), fine. However, there is a possibility that enemy might move into my path if I later go there, but not immediate.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT to (5,4)? That doesn't eat an apple, but keeps me alive. However, eating an apple is beneficial for score and growth, and also makes me longer, which can be both good and bad (longer snake might be harder to maneuver). But since we are at turn 5 of 150, growing is generally good for long-term survival and to reach higher scores. I should prioritize eating apples when safe.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe and eat apples. Which one gives more future options? Let's examine the board around each potential new head.\n\nIf I go UP to (4,5):\n- Adjacent cells: (4,6) apple, (3,5) empty? (3,5) is '.' (row 5 shows (3,5) is '.'), (5,5) empty? (5,5) is '.' (row 5, (5,5) .). So I can go left, right, or up next turn. Also down would go back to (4,4) which is my body (since (4,4) becomes part of body). So from (4,5), the possible next moves: UP to (4,6) (apple), LEFT to (3,5) (empty), RIGHT to (5,5) (empty). So three directions available. That's good.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,4):\n- Adjacent cells: (3,5) empty (row 5, (3,5) .), (3,3) empty? (3,3) is '.' (row 3, (3,3) .), (2,4) empty? (2,4) is '.' (row 4, (2,4) .), (4,4) is my body (since head was (4,4) and now it's part of body). So from (3,4), possible next moves: UP to (3,5) (empty), DOWN to (3,3) (empty), LEFT to (2,4) (empty). Also maybe RIGHT to (4,4) is not allowed (into own body). So three directions available. Both seem equally good.\n\nNow consider long-term plan: I have 2 apples now, enemy has 1. I want to increase my lead. Eating an apple now gives me 3, enemy 1. However, the enemy might also eat an apple soon. I should consider which apple is more strategically valuable. The apple at (4,5) is directly above my head. The apple at (3,4) is to the left. Both are adjacent. Which one might be contested? Enemy is far away at (8,4). It might not reach either in the near future. So both are safe.\n\nBut perhaps there is a hidden risk: if I move UP to (4,5), I might become more vulnerable to being trapped later because I'm moving deeper into the top-left area where many apples are, but also the board is open. Actually (4,5) is still near the center. If I move LEFT to (3,4), I'm moving leftwards, which might bring me closer to the left wall (x=0) but still far. Not a concern.\n\nMaybe we should consider the possibility of enemy moving to block our future path. For example, if I go LEFT to (3,4), then later I might want to go UP to (3,5) and then to (3,8) apple. Enemy could potentially come from the right and cut me off? Unlikely soon.\n\nAnother factor: I might want to avoid creating a situation where my own body becomes a barrier. Currently, if I go UP, my body becomes vertical line at x=4, y=4,3,2. If I later want to move left from (4,5), I can. But if I continue moving up, my body will extend downward, making the column more congested. However, I can always turn. If I go LEFT, my body becomes L-shaped, which might offer more maneuverability.\n\nLet's also consider the enemy's possible move into my body. If I move UP to (4,5), my body will occupy (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). The enemy could move into (4,4) if it moves LEFT from (5,4) but enemy is at (8,4), so not. If enemy moves DOWN to (8,3) and then later, etc. Not immediate.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3,4), my body occupies (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). Same.\n\nSo both seem fine.\n\nNow, think about the apples list: There are many apples, but some are far. I should plan a path that allows me to collect multiple apples efficiently while avoiding the enemy. The enemy is at (8,4). It might head towards the apples on the right side, like (9,0), (9,1), (9,3), (9,6), (8,6), etc. That's fine; we can compete on the left side.\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT might be slightly better because it moves me towards the cluster of apples on the left-top: (1,9), (2,9), (5,9), (3,8), (2,7), (1,9). Also (3,4) apple is eaten, and then from (3,4) I can go up to (3,5), then up to (3,6) (empty), (3,7) (empty), (3,8) apple. That's a clear path. If I go UP to (4,5), I can go up to (4,6) apple, then (4,7) empty, (4,8) empty, (4,9) empty? (4,9) is '.' from row 9, so yes empty. Then I could go left to (3,9) or right to (5,9) apple. Both are possible.\n\nBut note: (4,6) is an apple, and (4,7) is empty, (4,8) empty, (4,9) empty. That's also a nice vertical path. However, if I go UP to (4,5), I might want to go right to (5,5) to get to (5,9) apple, but that's more turns.\n\nMaybe we should consider the enemy's position and potential collision if both snakes move towards same apple. For example, apple (8,6) is near enemy, but that's far from me. Not a concern.\n\nGiven that both moves are equally safe and give apple, I need to pick one. Perhaps I should choose the move that gives more space to maneuver after eating. Let's analyze the board around (4,5) and (3,4) in terms of future dead ends.\n\nFrom (4,5): the cells (4,6) apple, (3,5) empty, (5,5) empty. All are safe. However, note that (4,6) apple is directly above. If I go to (4,5) and then to (4,6), I'll eat another apple, grow more. That could be a quick double. But after (4,6), my body will extend further up. Then from (4,6), possible moves: (4,7) empty, (3,6) empty, (5,6) empty? (5,6) is '.' (row 6, (5,6) .). So still open. So that's fine.\n\nFrom (3,4): after eating, I could go to (3,5) (empty), then (3,6) empty, (3,7) empty, (3,8) apple. That's a clear line as well.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nMaybe we should consider that moving LEFT puts my head at (3,4), which is an apple, but also note that (3,4) is directly to the left of my current head. That means my head will be adjacent to my own body at (4,4). That's fine.\n\nNow, we also need to think about the enemy's possible move that could cause a head-on collision with my head after my move. For example, if I move UP to (4,5), and enemy moves DOWN to (8,3), no collision. If enemy moves LEFT to (7,4) (illegal), no. If enemy moves UP to (8,5), fine. If enemy moves RIGHT to (9,4), fine. But what if enemy moves in a way that later its head might intersect my head? Not this turn.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3,4), same.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nMaybe we should consider the fact that I have two apples now, and I want to grow longer to survive longer. Eating an apple is always good. But perhaps we should consider the board's edges: moving UP to (4,5) is moving away from the left wall, which is good because if I later need to go down, I have space. Moving LEFT to (3,4) moves me leftwards, closer to the left wall (x=0). But I'm at x=3, still far from left wall. Not a problem.\n\nAnother angle: my body is currently at (4,3) and (4,2). If I move UP, my body becomes a vertical line, which might make it harder to turn around if I get trapped. If I move LEFT, my body becomes an L-shape, which might allow me to more easily reverse direction? Actually, from an L-shape, you might have more turning options because the head is not directly above the body's line. But both are manageable.\n\nGiven that the game is long (150 turns), I should consider long-term planning. Let's think about a path that collects apples efficiently. There are many apples on the top row (y=9) and around. I could aim to sweep the top left. Moving LEFT to (3,4) gets me closer to the left side, but (4,5) also does. Actually (4,5) is x=4, (3,4) is x=3. The difference is small.\n\nPerhaps we should look at the apple distribution: Apples at (1,9), (2,9), (5,9), (3,8), (2,7), (1,9). That's a cluster on the top-left. (4,6) apple is separate but still on the left side. (3,4) apple is also left side. (4,5) apple is center. Both are in that region.\n\nI think either is fine. But we need to choose one. I'll base my decision on which move gives me more immediate future options and avoids any potential traps.\n\nConsider the board after moving to (4,5): My snake occupies (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). The cells around (4,5) are open. However, note that (4,4) is now part of my body, so I cannot go back there. That's fine.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4): My snake occupies (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). The cells around (3,4) are open. Also, note that (3,4) is adjacent to (3,5) (up), (3,3) (down), (2,4) (left). All empty.\n\nNow, what about the enemy's potential to move into my body? If I move to (3,4), my body includes (4,4). Could enemy move into (4,4)? Enemy head is at (8,4). To reach (4,4), enemy would need to move left 4 cells in one turn, impossible. So safe.\n\nIf I move to (4,5), my body includes (4,4). Same.\n\nThus, both are equally safe.\n\nMaybe I should consider that moving UP might put me directly under an apple (4,6) and that's good. But moving LEFT also puts me under an apple? (3,4) is left, but (3,5) is empty, (3,6) empty, (3,8) apple is farther.\n\nGiven the lack of decisive factors, perhaps I should choose UP because my last move was UP, and I might want to continue in that direction to quickly reach (4,6) apple, which is only two steps away (UP to (4,5), then UP to (4,6)). That would give me two apples in two turns, increasing my score to 4. That seems efficient. Also, moving UP keeps me in the same vertical line, which might be easier to navigate without making sharp turns. However, if I go LEFT, I can still go UP later to (3,5) and then to (3,8) but that's more steps.\n\nLet's calculate: If I go UP to (4,5) and then UP to (4,6), I'll have eaten two apples in two turns (total 4 apples). If I go LEFT to (3,4) and then UP to (3,5) and then UP to (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), that's 4 turns to eat one more apple (3,8). So UP direction seems faster for apple accumulation in the short term.\n\nBut wait, after (4,5), I could also go RIGHT to (5,5) and then to (5,9) apple? That's longer.\n\nSo perhaps UP is better for rapid growth.\n\nAlso, note that enemy might go for apples on the right side. I should focus on the left side, but that doesn't differentiate.\n\nGiven that my last move was UP, and I want to maintain momentum, continuing UP might be natural. But the last move is just information; it doesn't constrain.\n\nI think I'll choose UP. But let's double-check for any hidden dangers: moving UP to (4,5) is an apple, so I'll grow. That means after the move, my body will be longer, which might make it harder to turn in tight spaces later, but that's fine.\n\nNow, consider the enemy's possible move: If enemy moves UP to (8,5), that's fine. If enemy moves DOWN to (8,3), that's fine. If enemy moves RIGHT to (9,4), that's fine. No collision.\n\nWhat about the possibility that enemy moves LEFT into (7,4) which is its own body, so it would die. That would be good for me, but we cannot rely on that. If enemy dies, I win immediately. So I should not do anything that might cause me to die before enemy dies. But both moves are safe.\n\nIf enemy moves LEFT and dies, I win regardless of my move (as long as I'm alive). So I should choose a move that keeps me alive, which both do.\n\nThus, UP is safe.\n\nNow, I need to output my move. The final line must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nI'll go with UP.\n\nBut before that, I should think if there's any reason to prefer LEFT. Perhaps because (4,5) is an apple, but (4,6) is also an apple, and moving UP might lead to a situation where I have to go through a narrow passage? Not really.\n\nAnother thought: my body is at (4,3) and (4,2). If I move UP to (4,5), my head moves away from my body, which is good. If I move LEFT to (3,4), my head moves sideways, which might put my head at (3,4) and my body at (4,4) adjacent. That means if I then move RIGHT in the next turn, I'd go back to (4,4) which is my body, causing death. So that's a potential trap: if I go LEFT, then next turn I might accidentally move back into my own body. But I can avoid that. However, it's a risk if I'm not careful. But as a skilled player, I can avoid it. Still, it's something to consider: moving UP gives a straight line, which is simpler.\n\nAlso, note that after moving LEFT, the cell (4,4) becomes part of my body, and it's directly to the right of my head. So if I later need to go right, I might be blocked by my own body. That could limit my rightward movement. Whereas after moving UP, my body is directly below my head, so moving down is blocked, but moving left or right is fine.\n\nGiven that, perhaps UP is safer in terms of not having my body adjacent to the right, leaving that side open for future exploration. Actually after moving LEFT, my body is to the right, so moving right is impossible (would hit myself). But after moving UP, my body is below, so moving down is impossible, but moving left or right is possible. Since the board is wide, both have one blocked direction.\n\nBut after moving UP, I can still move left to (3,5) or right to (5,5). After moving LEFT, I can move up to (3,5) or down to (3,3) or left to (2,4). So both give three options.\n\nI think both are fine, but I'll stick with UP as it seems more straightforward and aligns with the vertical growth I already have.\n\nThus, my move is UP.\n\nNow, I need to write a short rationale before the final move line. The rationale should be for my future self, explaining the reasoning and plan. Since the last move information will be shown back to me next turn, I should include a plan.\n\nRationale: \"I will move UP to (4,5) to eat the apple, increasing my score to 3. This keeps me on a clear path to the apple at (4,6) next turn, allowing rapid growth. The enemy is far away, so collision is unlikely. I will continue upward to collect top-left apples while avoiding my own body.\"\n\nBut the instruction says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I should include a plan. Let's make it concise.\n\n\"Plan: Move UP to eat apple at (4,5). Next turn, aim for apple at (4,6). Then consider heading left to collect apples near top-left cluster, while watching enemy movements. Avoid getting trapped.\"\n\nThat should suffice.\n\nNow, final answer: UP.\n\nBut ensure the last line is exactly \"UP\". No extra text.\n\nI'll structure the response: first, rationale/plan, then \"UP\".\n\nLet's write itI will move UP to (4,5) to eat the apple, increasing my score to 3. This keeps me on a clear path to the apple at (4,6) next turn, allowing rapid growth. The enemy is far away, so collision is unlikely. I will continue upward to collect top-left apples while avoiding my own body and maintaining flexibility.\n\nUP",

Body is currently [**(4,6)**, (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]. I did not eat an apple last turn (I moved from (4,6) to (3,6), and (3,6) was not an apple in the state *before* my move). Wait, looking back at the state provided in Turn 7: the board shows `(3, 6)` as `1`. The apple list includes `(2, 6)`. The previous turn's move was LEFT. The previous state showed head at (4,6). So I moved to (3,6). Was (3,6) an apple? The apple list provided in Turn 7: `(1, 9), (7, 9), (3, 8), (2, 7), (2, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (5, 9), (3, 4), (9, 3), (8, 1), (2, 6), (8, 2), (3, 0), (3, 3)`. It does **not** contain (3,6). I did not grow. My body length is still 5.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0)**: Head at (9, 6). Body at [(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4)]. Apples: 3.\n    *   **Apples**: (2, 6) is an apple directly to my left (x=2, y=6). (3, 4) is an apple below me (x=3, y=4). (2, 7) is an apple above-left. (3, 8) is above. (5, 9) is far top-right. (2, 9) is top-left.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves (Simultaneous)**:\n    *   **My Head**: (3, 6).\n    *   **My Body**: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3)]. Note that (4, 6) is directly to my right.\n    *   **Enemy Head**: (9, 6). Enemy body: [(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4)].\n\n    *   **Candidate Moves**:\n        *   **LEFT (x=2, y=6)**:\n            *   Target is (2, 6).\n            *   Board: (2, 6) is an **Apple**.\n            *   Safety: (2, 6) is not in my body. (2, 6) is not in enemy body (enemy is at x=8,9).\n            *   Enemy Collision: Enemy is far right. Enemy moves UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. If Enemy moves LEFT to (8,6), that is far away. If Enemy moves UP to (9,7) or DOWN to (9,5), also far. No collision risk.\n            *   Outcome: Eat apple. Grow. Good.\n        *   **RIGHT (x=4, y=6)**:\n            *   Target is (4, 6).\n            *   Safety: (4, 6) is my current body segment (specifically, the segment immediately behind my head). Moving backwards into self is suicide. **DEADLY**.\n        *   **UP (x=3, y=7)**:\n            *   Target is (3, 7).\n            *   Board: Empty.\n            *   Safety: Not in my body. Not in enemy body.\n            *   Enemy Collision: Safe.\n            *   Outcome: Safe, but no apple immediately.\n        *   **DOWN (x=3, y=5)**:\n            *   Target is (3, 5).\n            *   Board: Empty.\n            *   Safety: Not in my body. Not in enemy body.\n            *   Enemy Collision: Safe.\n            *   Outcome: Safe, but no apple immediately.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation**:\n    *   **Immediate Gain**: LEFT allows me to eat the apple at (2, 6). This is a clear score increase (+1 apple) and length increase.\n    *   **Pathing**: Eating at (2, 6) puts me at x=2. From there, I have access to (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 6). (2, 7) is an apple. (2, 9) is an apple. There is a clear path along the top-left area.\n    *   **Enemy Threat**: The enemy is at (9, 6). They are on the far right side. They cannot reach me in the next few turns. I have time to clear the left side.\n    *   **Risk**: The only risk is if the enemy predicts my move and somehow moves to intercept, but with the distance involved, it's impossible for a head-on collision this turn.\n\n4.  **Decision**:\n    *   RIGHT is a suicide move (into my own neck).\n    *   UP and DOWN are safe but pass up a guaranteed apple right next to me.\n    *   LEFT is safe, eats an apple, and positions me well for the next turn (targeting (2, 7) or clearing the column).\n    *   Therefore, the best move is LEFT.\n\n**Final Move Selection:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

I successfully ate the apple at (2, 6). My body is currently [**(3, 6)**, (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2)]. Since I ate, I grew by 1.

Not out of bounds.\n            *   Analysis: Moving left opens up the leftmost column (x=0). This provides more space to maneuver. (0, 6) is currently empty. (0, 7) and (0, 8) are also empty.\n        *   **RIGHT (x=3, y=6)**:\n            *   Target: (3, 6).\n            *   Safety: (3, 6) is my current neck. Moving into my own body is death. **DEADLY**.\n        *   **UP (x=2, y=7)**:\n            *   Target: (2, 7).\n            *   Board: There is an **Apple** at (2, 7).\n            *   Safety: Not in my body.

Not in enemy body.\n            *   Outcome: Safe, but moves away from the cluster of apples at the top.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation**:\n    *   **Immediate Gain**: UP allows eating an apple at (2, 7). LEFT is just empty space.\n    *   **Positioning**:\n        *   If I go UP to (2, 7), I block my own path slightly, but I am closer to (2, 9), (3, 8), (1, 9). However, (2, 7) is a \"corner\" relative to my body. If I go UP, my body follows (3, 6) -> (2, 6). The tail is at (4, 2). I have space.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (1, 6), I head towards the left wall. (1, 9) is an apple. (2, 9) is an apple. (0, 9) is empty.\n    *   **Enemy Interaction**: Enemy is at (8, 6). They are moving. If they move LEFT, they go to (7, 6). They are currently far right. They are not an immediate threat to my position at (2, 6).\n    *   **Safety vs Reward**: UP gives a point. LEFT does not. However, looking at the board, the top-left area is dense with apples: (2, 7), (2, 9), (1, 9), (3, 8), (3, 9).\n    *   **Trapping Risk**: If I go UP to (2, 7), I am at y=7. My body is at y=6. If I later need to go back down, I might run into my own body if it hasn't moved.\n    *   **Plan**: The most reliable strategy is to clear the top-left quadrant. The apple at (2, 7) is in the way of reaching (2, 9) and (3, 8). Eating it clears the path. Furthermore, moving UP avoids the immediate left wall which might be a dead end later if the enemy cuts me off (though unlikely now). But actually, looking at the map, (3, 8) is an apple. To get there from (2, 6), going UP to (2, 7) is the direct route.\n    *   **Comparison**:\n        *   UP: Eat (2, 7). Now at (2, 7). Next turn options: (1, 7), (3, 7), (2, 8). (2, 8) is empty. (3, 8) is an apple. (2, 9) is an apple. This looks like a very open path to a cluster.\n        *   LEFT: Move to (1, 6). Next turn options: (0, 6), (2, 6), (1, 5), (1, 7). (1, 6) has no immediate apple. (1, 9) is far.\n    *   **Decision**: UP is clearly better. It gains a point immediately and moves me towards a cluster of apples (3, 8, 2, 9, 1, 9). It maintains distance from the enemy. Moving LEFT delays progress towards the apple cluster for no gain.\n\n4.  **Final Decision**:\n    *   RIGHT is suicide (into my neck).\n    *   DOWN is safe but moves away from the nearest apples and the dense cluster.\n    *   LEFT is safe but moves away from the nearest apple and doesn't optimize for the cluster.\n    *   UP is safe, eats an apple, and positions me to clear the top-left region efficiently.\n\n**Final Move Selection:** UP\n\nUP",

Within bounds.\n    *   Strategic Value: This moves me closer to the apple at (3, 8) and the cluster at (2, 9) and (1, 9). It maintains an open line of retreat via (2, 7) -> (2, 6) provided the tail moves. It keeps me centered in the upper quadrant.\n\n2.  **DOWN (2, 6)**:\n    *   Coordinates: (2, 6).\n    *   Board State: My body (specifically the segment immediately following the head).\n    *   Safety: **DEADLY**. This is moving backwards into my own body. I cannot do this.\n\n3.  **LEFT (1, 7)**:\n    *   Coordinates: (1, 7).\n    *   Board State: Empty.\n    *   Safety: Not part of my body. Within bounds.\n    *   Strategic Value: This moves me towards the left edge. While safe, it moves me away from the immediate apples at (3, 8) and (2, 9). The left edge (x=0) might restrict future movement options if the enemy pressures from the right.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 7)**:\n    *   Coordinates: (3, 7).\n    *   Board State: Empty.\n    *   Safety: Not part of my body. Within bounds.\n    *   Strategic Value: This moves me towards the apples at (3, 8) and (2, 9). However, it is slightly closer to the enemy snake at (9, 8) than UP is, though still very far. It is a valid move, but UP seems more direct to the vertical line of apples.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   **DOWN** is suicide.\n*   **LEFT** moves away from the densest cluster of apples (which are at x=1, 2, 3 and y=8, 9).\n*   **UP** and **RIGHT** are both safe and move towards the apple cluster.\n*   **UP** keeps me on the x=2 column, which leads directly to apples at (2, 8) (next turn potential) and (2, 9). It also opens up (1, 8) and (3, 8) for the turn after.\n*   **RIGHT** puts me at (3, 7), which is a great position to grab (3, 8) immediately next turn. However, my current position at (2, 7) is also perfectly positioned to grab (2, 8) or (3, 8).\n\nLet's look at the apples: (2, 7) is gone (eaten last turn). Next nearest are (2, 9), (3, 8), (1, 9).\nIf I go **UP** to (2, 8):\n    Next turn options: (1, 8), (3, 8), (2, 9).\n    (3, 8) is an apple. (2, 9) is an apple. This is excellent.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (3, 7):\n    Next turn options: (2, 7), (4, 7), (3, 6), (3, 8).\n    (3, 8) is an apple.\nBoth are good. However, moving **UP** keeps me further from the enemy just in case. The enemy is at (9, 8). If the enemy moves aggressively West, maintaining distance is good. Also, moving UP allows me to block the path from the top-right apples if needed later.\n\nThe apple at (3, 8) is very reachable from (2, 8) (one move right). The apple at (2, 9) is reachable from (2, 8) (one move up).\nMoving UP sets up a potential path: (2, 8) -> (2, 9) -> (3, 9) -> (3, 8).\nMoving RIGHT sets up: (3, 7) -> (3, 8) -> (2, 9).\nBoth are viable. I will choose **UP** to maintain central positioning in the upper field and to approach the (2,9) and (3,8) apples from the most optimal angle.\n\nUP",

Body: `[(2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)]`. Score: 6.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(8, 8)`. Body: `[(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6)]`. Score: 3.\n    *   **Apples:** There are multiple apples in the upper-left region, specifically at `(1, 9)`, `(2, 9)`, `(3, 8)`, and `(5, 9)`.\n    *   **Turn:** 10/150.\n\n2.  **Potential Moves:**\n    *   **UP (2, 9):** Target is an apple. I check safety.\n        *   Board check: According to the grid, `(2, 9)` is marked as an apple ('A').\n        *   Collision check: Is my body there? No (Body starts at `y=7`). Is the enemy body there? No (Enemy is at `x=8` and `x=9`).\n        *   Enemy head collision: The enemy head is at `(8, 8)`. It cannot reach `(2, 9)` in one move.\n        *   **Result:** Safe and beneficial (eats apple).\n    *   **LEFT (1, 8):**\n        *   Board check: Grid shows `(1, 8)` is empty ('.').\n        *   Safety: Safe from walls and immediate body collision.\n        *   Result: Safe, but does not eat an apple immediately.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 8):** Target is an apple.\n        *   Board check: Grid shows `(3, 8)` is an apple ('A').\n        *   Safety: Safe from walls and body.\n        *   Result: Safe and beneficial.\n    *   **DOWN (2, 7):**\n        *   Board check: `(2, 7)` is part of my body (segment `[0]`).\n        *   Result: **DEADLY** (Suicide into self).\n\n3.  **Comparison of Safe Moves (UP vs. LEFT vs. RIGHT):**\n    *   **LEFT (1, 8):** Moves away from the apple cluster at `x=2, 3`. While it might keep distance from the enemy (currently at `x=8`), it isolates me from the nearest food sources.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 8):** Eats an apple. Moves toward the center but puts my head at `(3, 8)`. From there, next turn I could go to `(3, 9)` (safe), `(4, 8)` (safe), `(2, 8)` (previous spot), or `(3, 7)` (safe). This is a strong option.\n    *   **UP (2, 9):** Eats an apple. Moves to the top edge. From there, next turn I could go to `(1, 9)` (apple), `(3, 9)` (safe/open), or back to `(2, 8)`. This aligns with the apple cluster at `(1, 9)` and `(5, 9)`.\n\n    **Strategic Decision:**\n    Moving **UP** to `(2, 9)` is the most advantageous move.\n    *   **Immediate Reward:** It consumes the apple at `(2, 9)`, increasing my score to 7 and extending my tail. This is crucial for staying ahead of the enemy (3 apples vs 6).\n    *   **Positioning:** It places my head on the top row (`y=9`), which restricts enemy movement relative to the top edge. The enemy snake is currently at `(8, 8)` and seems to be exploring the right side.\n    *   **Future Options:** From `(2, 9)`, I have access to `(1, 9)` (which is an apple) and `(3, 9)` (which is empty). This creates a sequence of moves to clear the top-left apples.\n    *   **Safety:** There are no immediate threats. The enemy is far away at `x=8`. My body is well-structured (going down and right), so moving up does not risk immediate self-collision.\n\n    Moving RIGHT to `(3, 8)` is also safe and eats an apple, but `UP` allows me to approach the `(1, 9)` apple more naturally on the following turn. Since `(1, 9)` and `(2, 9)` are adjacent apples, moving to `(2, 9)` sets up a perfect sweep of the top-left corner.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the top-left apple cluster (`(2,9)`, `(1,9)`, then `(5,9)`). Keep the enemy snake contained on the right side by occupying the top row. Avoid turning into tight corridors unless necessary to prevent the enemy from cutting me off. Maintain a healthy length to deter the enemy from engaging in a collision course.\n\nUP",

Score: 4.\n    *   **Apples:** Visible apples include `(1, 9)`, `(7, 9)`, and `(5, 9)` on the top row.\n    *   **Turn:** 11/150.\n\n2.  **Potential Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT (1, 9):** Target is an apple ('A'). Collision check: Is it safe? Yes, `1,9` is an apple and not part of my body or enemy body.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 9):** The grid shows `(3, 9)` is empty ('.'). Collision check: Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (2, 8):** This is the segment immediately behind my head in my body list. Moving here would be moving directly backwards into my own body. **Result: DEADLY.**\n    *   **UP:** Off the board (y > 9). **Result: DEADLY.**\n\n3.  **Comparison of Safe Moves (LEFT vs. RIGHT):**\n    *   **LEFT (1, 9):** This moves me to an apple. From `(1, 9)`, I can access `(0, 9)` (wall), `(1, 8)` (safe), or `(2, 9)` (safe/previous). This is a strong option to secure points and position.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 9):** This moves me to an empty cell. From `(3, 9)`, I can access `(2, 9)` (safe/previous), `(4, 9)` (safe), `(3, 8)` (apple), or down to `(3, 8)`. However, moving right brings me closer to the enemy snake, which is currently at `(8, 9)`. While not an immediate collision, closing the distance on the top row is risky.\n\n    **Strategic Decision:**\n    Moving **LEFT** to `(1, 9)` is the superior move.\n    *   **Immediate Reward:** It consumes the apple at `(1, 9)`, increasing my score to 8.\n    *   **Positioning:** It moves me away from the enemy snake (currently at `x=8`) toward the corner at `x=0`. This expands the territory I control and potentially cuts off the enemy's access to the top-left apples like `(1, 9)` and `(2, 9)`.\n    *   **Safety:** `LEFT` is safe from walls, self-collision (forward into body is only possible if the body loops back to that cell, which it doesn't), and enemy collision. The enemy is far away and cannot reach `(1, 9)` this turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the top-left apple cluster. By moving to `(1, 9)`, I set up a follow-up move to `(1, 8)` or `(2, 8)` to clear the remaining apples in that quadrant. I must remain vigilant of the enemy snake moving towards the center or left side, but currently, occupying the top row is key.\n\nLEFT",

Body: `[(2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)]`. Score: 8.\n        *   *Note:* The body list provided in the prompt ends at `(4, 4)`. Based on the move to `(1, 9)` (which ate an apple at `1,9` from `2,9` in the previous turn), the tail `(4, 4)` remains, and the new head is `(1, 9)`. This matches the visual board state where `(1,9)` is now my head.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(7, 9)`. Body: `[(8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6)]`. Score: 5.\n        *   The enemy is on the top row at `x=7`, moving towards `x=8` or `x=9`.\n    *   **Apples:** Visible apples on the board include `(0, 9)`, `(3, 8)`, `(5, 9)`, `(3, 5)`, etc.\n    *   **Turn:** 12/150.\n\n2.  **Potential Moves (from Head at 1, 9):**\n    *   **LEFT (0, 9):** Target is an apple ('A'). Collision check: Is it safe?\n        *   *Board:* `(0, 9)` shows 'A' (visual row 9, col 0).\n        *   *Self:* My body segments are at `(2,9), (2,8)...`. `(0,9)` is not in my body.\n        *   *Enemy:* Enemy body is at `(8,9), (8,8)...`. `(0,9)` is not in enemy body.\n        *   *Enemy Head Prediction:* Enemy head is at `(7, 9)`. Possible moves: `(6, 9)`, `(7, 8)`, or `(8, 9)`. `(8, 9)` is currently occupied by their own body, so `(6, 9)` or `(7, 8)` are likely. `(0, 9)` is far away from `x=6,7`.\n        *   *Verdict:* Safe and eats an apple.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 8):** Target is empty ('.'). Collision check:\n        *   *Board:* `(1, 8)` shows '.'.\n        *   *Self:* Not in body.\n        *   *Enemy:* Not in enemy body.\n        *   *Verdict:* Safe, but no apple.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 9):** Target is my own body. Moving here would be moving directly sideways into the segment immediately adjacent to the head. This counts as moving into your own body and results in death.\n        *   *Verdict:* **DEADLY**.\n    *   **UP:** Off the board (y > 9). **DEADLY**.\n\n3.  **Comparison of Safe Moves (LEFT vs. DOWN):**\n    *   **LEFT (0, 9):** Moves to the corner, eating an apple. This is optimal for score. From `(0, 9)`, my only safe exit is `(0, 8)` (since `(1, 9)` will be my body). `(0, 8)` is currently empty.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 8):** Moves to an empty cell. This preserves the corner apple for later. However, it moves me closer to the center and leaves me exposed to potential future threats. The apple at `(0, 9)` is safe from the enemy (who is at `x=7`), so I can grab it now without pressure.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the superior move.\n1.  **Score:** It secures an immediate point, increasing my lead (8 vs 5).\n2.  **Safety:** The enemy is at `x=7`. With a body length of 5, they cannot reach `x=0` in one turn or even a few turns without crossing through the center. The corner is currently the safest place on the board.\n3.  **Positioning:** Securing the corner allows me to clear the top-left area systematically. The path from `(0,9)` -> `(0,8)` -> `(0,7)` -> ... -> `(0,0)` is clear of my body.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at `(0,9)`. From there, move down along the left edge to clear any apples in column 0 (if any) or move right towards `(1,8)`. This keeps the enemy confined to the right side of the board.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

So they cannot move right to `(7,9)`.\n    *   They can move UP (off board), DOWN `(6, 8)`, or LEFT `(5, 9)`.\n    *   `(5, 9)` is an apple. It is likely they will eat it.\n    *   If they eat `(5, 9)`, their head is at `(5, 9)`.\n    *   My head is at `(0, 9)`.\n    *   We are far apart.\n    *   The move DOWN is the only legal move, and it is safe.\n\n**Strategic Plan for Next Turns:**\nMove down along the left edge (Column 0) until reaching the bottom-left corner `(0,0)`. Then, move right along the bottom row to re-enter the main board area. This avoids the enemy snake on the right side and allows me to maintain my score lead while minimizing risk. Do not deviate from this path unless an apple appears directly in the path or the enemy forces a confrontation.\n\nLEFT",
