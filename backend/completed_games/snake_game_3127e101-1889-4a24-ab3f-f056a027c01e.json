My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**.

If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**. It makes sense to continue moving in this direction. The other apples are farther and would take longer to reach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Assessing the enemy snake (Snake #0)**\n- Snake #0 is still at **(1, 0)**, and it has no body yet, so it can't block me. It is unlikely to interfere with my path toward (6, 4) for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Avoiding walls and staying safe**\n- My position is near the center of the board, so there is no immediate risk of hitting walls.\n- Aside from Snake #0, there is also minimal risk of running into danger. The next possible steps are all clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Path to (6, 4)**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, I need to either:\n\n- Go **RIGHT** (to move from x=5 to x=6), or  \n- Go **UP** (to move from y=2 to y=3).\n\n---\n\n#### **Which should I choose?**\n- **RIGHT** is the most direct move toward the apple (it reduces distance efficiently).  \n- **UP** would also help, but going UP first delays moving horizontal, which isn't optimal when the x-coordinate also needs adjustment quickly.  \n\nHence, **RIGHT** is the most logical next move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Reevaluating after this move**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I will be at **(6, 2)**. If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**. It makes sense to continue moving in this direction. The other apples are farther and would take longer to reach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Assessing the enemy snake (Snake #0)**\n- Snake #0 is still at **(1, 0)**, and it has no body yet, so it can't block me. It is unlikely to interfere with my path toward (6, 4) for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Avoiding walls and staying safe**\n- My position is near the center of the board, so there is no immediate risk of hitting walls.\n- Aside from Snake #0, there is also minimal risk of running into danger. The next possible steps are all clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Path to (6, 4)**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, I need to either:\n\n- Go **RIGHT** (to move from x=5 to x=6), or  \n- Go **UP** (to move from y=2 to y=3).\n\n---\n\n#### **Which should I choose?**\n- **RIGHT** is the most direct move toward the apple (it reduces distance efficiently).  \n- **UP** would also help, but going UP first delays moving horizontal, which isn't optimal when the x-coordinate also needs adjustment quickly.  \n\nHence, **RIGHT** is the most logical next move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Reevaluating after this move**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I will be at **(6, 2)**. If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

Focus on staying centralized and maximizing safe paths to remaining apples.\n  - Remaining vertically aligned (**column 6**) ensures I have flexibility to branch out to the left or right for other apples as needed.  \n\n- **Enemy Snake Monitor:**  \n  - The enemy snake (Snake #0) is not close enough to threaten me. I will continue to monitor its position but won\u2019t need to adjust my strategy based on its actions just yet.  \n\n---\n\n### **Decision:** **UP**\n\n- **Rationale:** Moving **UP to (6, 5)** keeps me on track to collect the apple at **(6, 6)** safely and efficiently while maintaining flexibility for the next turn.  \n- **Next-Turn Plan:** If no new apples spawn significantly closer than **(6, 6)**, continue moving **UP** to collect it. Afterward, re-evaluate paths to remaining apples, prioritizing **(6, 8)** unless other options become safer or shorter.\n\n--- \n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**. It makes sense to continue moving in this direction. The other apples are farther and would take longer to reach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Assessing the enemy snake (Snake #0)**\n- Snake #0 is still at **(1, 0)**, and it has no body yet, so it can't block me. It is unlikely to interfere with my path toward (6, 4) for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Avoiding walls and staying safe**\n- My position is near the center of the board, so there is no immediate risk of hitting walls.\n- Aside from Snake #0, there is also minimal risk of running into danger. The next possible steps are all clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Path to (6, 4)**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, I need to either:\n\n- Go **RIGHT** (to move from x=5 to x=6), or  \n- Go **UP** (to move from y=2 to y=3).\n\n---\n\n#### **Which should I choose?**\n- **RIGHT** is the most direct move toward the apple (it reduces distance efficiently).  \n- **UP** would also help, but going UP first delays moving horizontal, which isn't optimal when the x-coordinate also needs adjustment quickly.  \n\nHence, **RIGHT** is the most logical next move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Reevaluating after this move**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I will be at **(6, 2)**. If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

(6, 6) \u2192 **2 steps** away (**UP, UP**). Best option based on proximity.  \n  2. (6, 8) \u2192 4 steps away (**UP, UP, UP, UP depending on direction safety).**  \n  3. (8, 4) \u2192 2 steps to the **RIGHT**, but slightly riskier if I stray too far horizontally for choke points.  \n  4. (2, 7) \u2192 8 steps away and not within immediate reach.  \n  5. (9, 1) \u2192 Very far and low-priority.\n\n- **Enemy Snake:**  \n  - **Position:** (1, 2) with body at [(0, 2)].  \n  - Poses **no immediate threat** due to its distance from me and its movements along the opposite side of the board.  \n\n- **Board Safety:**  \n  - I\u2019m in the center of the board and have no immediate obstacles, walls, or body segments blocking my immediate paths.  \n  - Moving **UP** keeps me close to the middle of the board while safely approaching the next apple at (6, 6).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Apple Priority Analysis**\n1. **(6, 6)** is the closest apple. Moving toward this apple is logical as it\u2019s along a straight path with no obstacles, hazards, or detours.  \n2. After consuming **(6, 6)**, the next logical target will likely be **(6, 8)**, as it remains along an upward trajectory and closer than all other apples.  \n3. Although **(8, 4)** is just 2 steps away to the right, pursuing it would force me to veer horizontally and risk limiting my movement flexibility in the long term.  \n\nConclusion: **Moving UP to (6, 5)** positions me to collect the apple at **(6, 6)** efficiently, while maintaining flexibility for my next move.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategic Analysis**\n- **Path to (6, 6):**\n  - Safe to move **UP** twice (to **(6, 5)** and then **(6, 6)**).  \n  - No nearby obstacles or threats along this path.  \n\n- **Future Planning:**\n  - Once at **(6, 6)**, recalibrate based on new apple spawns. Focus on staying centralized and maximizing safe paths to remaining apples.\n  - Remaining vertically aligned (**column 6**) ensures I have flexibility to branch out to the left or right for other apples as needed.  \n\n- **Enemy Snake Monitor:**  \n  - The enemy snake (Snake #0) is not close enough to threaten me. I will continue to monitor its position but won\u2019t need to adjust my strategy based on its actions just yet.  \n\n---\n\n### **Decision:** **UP**\n\n- **Rationale:** Moving **UP to (6, 5)** keeps me on track to collect the apple at **(6, 6)** safely and efficiently while maintaining flexibility for the next turn.  \n- **Next-Turn Plan:** If no new apples spawn significantly closer than **(6, 6)**, continue moving **UP** to collect it. Afterward, re-evaluate paths to remaining apples, prioritizing **(6, 8)** unless other options become safer or shorter.\n\n--- \n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

This would be inefficient given my current position.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategic Considerations**\n\n- **Collecting one apple at a time is the most efficient strategy.**  \n  - The close proximity of **(6, 6)** and **(6, 8)** makes them natural consecutive targets for this turn and the next.\n  - Positioning myself centrally by remaining in the center of the board (column 6) provides flexibility after collecting these apples, especially if new apples spawn elsewhere.  \n- **Safety First:**  \n  - The board remains open and clear of obstacles, walls, or enemy snakes, meaning my path is safe and predictable for now.  \n- **Future Apple Collection:**  \n  - Once I consume **(6, 6)**, I will likely move **UP** toward **(6, 8)**, unless a closer or more accessible apple appears on the board.  \n  - The apple at **(8, 4)** could become a mid-term target once the **(6-column)** apples are collected.  \n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- After collecting **(6, 6)** this turn, immediately assess the apple locations and prioritize moving toward **(6, 8)** unless a new, closer apple spawns.

This would be inefficient given my current position.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategic Considerations**\n\n- **Collecting one apple at a time is the most efficient strategy.**  \n  - The close proximity of **(6, 6)** and **(6, 8)** makes them natural consecutive targets for this turn and the next.\n  - Positioning myself centrally by remaining in the center of the board (column 6) provides flexibility after collecting these apples, especially if new apples spawn elsewhere.  \n- **Safety First:**  \n  - The board remains open and clear of obstacles, walls, or enemy snakes, meaning my path is safe and predictable for now.  \n- **Future Apple Collection:**  \n  - Once I consume **(6, 6)**, I will likely move **UP** toward **(6, 8)**, unless a closer or more accessible apple appears on the board.  \n  - The apple at **(8, 4)** could become a mid-term target once the **(6-column)** apples are collected.  \n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- After collecting **(6, 6)** this turn, immediately assess the apple locations and prioritize moving toward **(6, 8)** unless a new, closer apple spawns.

However, this leaves the far closer apple **(6, 8)** unchecked.\n   - **DOWN:** Takes me back toward my body at (6, 5), resulting in **self-collision** and immediate death.

If no apples spawn nearby, **(8, 4)** may become the next mid-term goal, given that Snake #0 is far removed from my immediate vicinity.\n\n- **Maintain Safety First:** \n  - My attention should stay focused on avoiding narrow spaces as my length increases. Vertical and horizontal positioning to the center offers the best flexibility to adapt to new spawns or competing snakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**\n\nNext Turn Strategy: After reaching (6, 7) with the **UP** move, I will reassess the situation and most likely proceed to **(6, 8)** unless new apple positions drastically change my immediate strategy."

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**. It makes sense to continue moving in this direction. The other apples are farther and would take longer to reach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Assessing the enemy snake (Snake #0)**\n- Snake #0 is still at **(1, 0)**, and it has no body yet, so it can't block me. It is unlikely to interfere with my path toward (6, 4) for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Avoiding walls and staying safe**\n- My position is near the center of the board, so there is no immediate risk of hitting walls.\n- Aside from Snake #0, there is also minimal risk of running into danger. The next possible steps are all clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Path to (6, 4)**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, I need to either:\n\n- Go **RIGHT** (to move from x=5 to x=6), or  \n- Go **UP** (to move from y=2 to y=3).\n\n---\n\n#### **Which should I choose?**\n- **RIGHT** is the most direct move toward the apple (it reduces distance efficiently).  \n- **UP** would also help, but going UP first delays moving horizontal, which isn't optimal when the x-coordinate also needs adjustment quickly.  \n\nHence, **RIGHT** is the most logical next move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Reevaluating after this move**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I will be at **(6, 2)**. If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

(9, 1) \u2192 Very far and low-priority.\n\n- **Enemy Snake:**  \n  - **Position:** (1, 2) with body at [(0, 2)].  \n  - Poses **no immediate threat** due to its distance from me and its movements along the opposite side of the board.  \n\n- **Board Safety:**  \n  - I\u2019m in the center of the board and have no immediate obstacles, walls, or body segments blocking my immediate paths.  \n  - Moving **UP** keeps me close to the middle of the board while safely approaching the next apple at (6, 6).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Apple Priority Analysis**\n1. **(6, 6)** is the closest apple. Moving toward this apple is logical as it\u2019s along a straight path with no obstacles, hazards, or detours.  \n2. After consuming **(6, 6)**, the next logical target will likely be **(6, 8)**, as it remains along an upward trajectory and closer than all other apples.  \n3. Although **(8, 4)** is just 2 steps away to the right, pursuing it would force me to veer horizontally and risk limiting my movement flexibility in the long term.  \n\nConclusion: **Moving UP to (6, 5)** positions me to collect the apple at **(6, 6)** efficiently, while maintaining flexibility for my next move.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategic Analysis**\n- **Path to (6, 6):**\n  - Safe to move **UP** twice (to **(6, 5)** and then **(6, 6)**).  \n  - No nearby obstacles or threats along this path.  \n\n- **Future Planning:**\n  - Once at **(6, 6)**, recalibrate based on new apple spawns. Focus on staying centralized and maximizing safe paths to remaining apples.\n  - Remaining vertically aligned (**column 6**) ensures I have flexibility to branch out to the left or right for other apples as needed.  \n\n- **Enemy Snake Monitor:**  \n  - The enemy snake (Snake #0) is not close enough to threaten me. I will continue to monitor its position but won\u2019t need to adjust my strategy based on its actions just yet.  \n\n---\n\n### **Decision:** **UP**\n\n- **Rationale:** Moving **UP to (6, 5)** keeps me on track to collect the apple at **(6, 6)** safely and efficiently while maintaining flexibility for the next turn.  \n- **Next-Turn Plan:** If no new apples spawn significantly closer than **(6, 6)**, continue moving **UP** to collect it. Afterward, re-evaluate paths to remaining apples, prioritizing **(6, 8)** unless other options become safer or shorter.\n\n--- \n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

This would be inefficient given my current position.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategic Considerations**\n\n- **Collecting one apple at a time is the most efficient strategy.**  \n  - The close proximity of **(6, 6)** and **(6, 8)** makes them natural consecutive targets for this turn and the next.\n  - Positioning myself centrally by remaining in the center of the board (column 6) provides flexibility after collecting these apples, especially if new apples spawn elsewhere.  \n- **Safety First:**  \n  - The board remains open and clear of obstacles, walls, or enemy snakes, meaning my path is safe and predictable for now.  \n- **Future Apple Collection:**  \n  - Once I consume **(6, 6)**, I will likely move **UP** toward **(6, 8)**, unless a closer or more accessible apple appears on the board.  \n  - The apple at **(8, 4)** could become a mid-term target once the **(6-column)** apples are collected.  \n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- After collecting **(6, 6)** this turn, immediately assess the apple locations and prioritize moving toward **(6, 8)** unless a new, closer apple spawns.

This wastes time and risks unnecessary inefficiency.\n   - **RIGHT:** Places me at (7, 6), veering me toward **(8, 4)**. However, this leaves the far closer apple **(6, 8)** unchecked.\n   - **DOWN:** Takes me back toward my body at (6, 5), resulting in **self-collision** and immediate death. This is invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategy for Future Moves**\n\n- **Stay on the (6-column):**\n  - Consuming **(6, 8)** will lengthen my body without compromising my ability to move freely. \n  - Once I achieve that, I remain centralized and flexible to explore nearby targets. If no apples spawn nearby, **(8, 4)** may become the next mid-term goal, given that Snake #0 is far removed from my immediate vicinity.\n\n- **Maintain Safety First:** \n  - My attention should stay focused on avoiding narrow spaces as my length increases. Vertical and horizontal positioning to the center offers the best flexibility to adapt to new spawns or competing snakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**\n\nNext Turn Strategy: After reaching (6, 7) with the **UP** move, I will reassess the situation and most likely proceed to **(6, 8)** unless new apple positions drastically change my immediate strategy."

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**. It makes sense to continue moving in this direction. The other apples are farther and would take longer to reach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Assessing the enemy snake (Snake #0)**\n- Snake #0 is still at **(1, 0)**, and it has no body yet, so it can't block me. It is unlikely to interfere with my path toward (6, 4) for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Avoiding walls and staying safe**\n- My position is near the center of the board, so there is no immediate risk of hitting walls.\n- Aside from Snake #0, there is also minimal risk of running into danger. The next possible steps are all clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Path to (6, 4)**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, I need to either:\n\n- Go **RIGHT** (to move from x=5 to x=6), or  \n- Go **UP** (to move from y=2 to y=3).\n\n---\n\n#### **Which should I choose?**\n- **RIGHT** is the most direct move toward the apple (it reduces distance efficiently).  \n- **UP** would also help, but going UP first delays moving horizontal, which isn't optimal when the x-coordinate also needs adjustment quickly.  \n\nHence, **RIGHT** is the most logical next move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Reevaluating after this move**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I will be at **(6, 2)**. If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

Closest apple and directly within reach.  \n  2. **(6, 8):** 3 steps away (**UP, UP, UP**) after consuming **(6, 6)**. It\u2019s also along the same vertical trajectory, making it the second-best target.  \n  3. **(8, 4):** 2 steps away (**RIGHT, RIGHT**), but moving sideways risks less flexibility. Collecting this apple would take me off-track from **(6, 8)**, so I deprioritize it for now.  \n  4. **(2, 7):** Very far, at least 6 steps away, and low priority.  \n  5. **(9, 1):** The farthest apple and not a viable target at this time.\n\n- **Board State:**  \n  - My intended path is clear with **no threats or obstacles** along the route to **(6, 6)**.  \n  - Collecting **(6, 6)** aligns well with a vertical-focused strategy that maintains flexibility for pursuing future apples.  \n\n- **Enemy Snake:**  \n  - Snake #0 is still far away at **(2, 2)**, with its body at **[(1, 2)]**.  \n  - Poses **no immediate threat**, as it has no potential to intercept my target.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Move Analysis**\n\n1. **Option 1: Move UP**\n   - Moving **UP** to (6, 6) allows me to collect the nearby apple.  \n   - Growing in length adds (6, 5) to my body section, but it won\u2019t create a collision risk since the path ahead is completely clear.  \n   - Staying along the **6-column** keeps me positioned for **(6, 8)** as my likely next target.  \n\n2. **Other Moves (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN):**  \n   - Any movement other than **UP** would not make sense because:  \n     - **LEFT/DOWN**: Leads me away from the apples and wastes time.  \n     - **RIGHT**: Moving right towards **(8, 4)** would put me off-track from the vertical line targeting **(6, 8)**. This would be inefficient given my current position.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategic Considerations**\n\n- **Collecting one apple at a time is the most efficient strategy.**  \n  - The close proximity of **(6, 6)** and **(6, 8)** makes them natural consecutive targets for this turn and the next.\n  - Positioning myself centrally by remaining in the center of the board (column 6) provides flexibility after collecting these apples, especially if new apples spawn elsewhere.  \n- **Safety First:**  \n  - The board remains open and clear of obstacles, walls, or enemy snakes, meaning my path is safe and predictable for now.  \n- **Future Apple Collection:**  \n  - Once I consume **(6, 6)**, I will likely move **UP** toward **(6, 8)**, unless a closer or more accessible apple appears on the board.  \n  - The apple at **(8, 4)** could become a mid-term target once the **(6-column)** apples are collected.  \n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- After collecting **(6, 6)** this turn, immediately assess the apple locations and prioritize moving toward **(6, 8)** unless a new, closer apple spawns. Continue moving vertically where possible to stay efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

This is the closest apple and directly in my vertical path. The next most logical move is to head toward this apple.\n  2. **(3, 8):** 5 steps away (**LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP**) and not within a close trajectory.\n  3. **(8, 4):** Also far at 4 steps (**RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN**) and not efficiently reachable from my current position.\n  4. **(2, 7):** 7 steps away and irrelevant for now.\n  5. **(9, 1):** Still farthest and undeserving of attention.\n\n- **Board Clarity:**\n  - The **(6-column)** remains wide open with **no immediate threats or obstacles**.\n  - Consuming **(6, 8)** will extend my length and leave my tail still trailing in the column below (**6, 5 -> 6, 6 -> 6, 7 -> 6, 8**). This setup keeps me aligned for efficient movement.\n\n- **Enemy Snake:**\n  - Snake #0 presents no immediate danger as it hasn\u2019t moved significantly. It is too far from my path to pose any interference while I head toward **(6, 8)**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Move Analysis**\n\n1. **Option 1: Move UP**\n   - Moving **UP** from (6, 6) to (6, 7) is the most natural option.\n   - It positions me 1 step away from **(6, 8)** without deviating from a clear upward trajectory.\n   - This move avoids risk, maximizes efficiency toward the next apple, and maintains flexibility to reassess new apple spawns after reaching **(6, 8)**.\n\n---\n\n2. **Other Moves:**\n   - **LEFT:** Places me at (5, 6), moving away from any useful apple. This wastes time and risks unnecessary inefficiency.\n   - **RIGHT:** Places me at (7, 6), veering me toward **(8, 4)**. However, this leaves the far closer apple **(6, 8)** unchecked.\n   - **DOWN:** Takes me back toward my body at (6, 5), resulting in **self-collision** and immediate death. This is invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategy for Future Moves**\n\n- **Stay on the (6-column):**\n  - Consuming **(6, 8)** will lengthen my body without compromising my ability to move freely. \n  - Once I achieve that, I remain centralized and flexible to explore nearby targets. If no apples spawn nearby, **(8, 4)** may become the next mid-term goal, given that Snake #0 is far removed from my immediate vicinity.\n\n- **Maintain Safety First:** \n  - My attention should stay focused on avoiding narrow spaces as my length increases. Vertical and horizontal positioning to the center offers the best flexibility to adapt to new spawns or competing snakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**\n\nNext Turn Strategy: After reaching (6, 7) with the **UP** move, I will reassess the situation and most likely proceed to **(6, 8)** unless new apple positions drastically change my immediate strategy."

This apple is the closest and the most logical next goal to continue growing efficiently and safely.\n  2. **(3, 8):** **4 steps away** (**LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP**) and less optimal since it's farther and not vertically aligned.\n  3. **(8, 4):** **5 steps away** (**RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN**) and not reachable without going off my current efficient path.\n  4. **(2, 7):** **7 steps away**, entirely on the other side of the board and irrelevant for the moment.\n  5. **(9, 1):** **Even farther** and does not affect current decisions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Gameboard Observations**\n\n1. **Apple at (6, 8):**\n   - This apple is **1 step away**, making it the obvious next move. By moving **UP**, I will not only claim the apple but also grow my snake while keeping my position centralized and safe.\n\n2. **Future Pathing After (6, 8):**\n   - After consuming the apple, my finalized body positions will be:\n     - Head at **(6, 8)**\n     - Body at **[(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]**\n   - This setup keeps my snake safely centralized in the **6-column**, and I'll have room to maneuver freely based on new apple spawns.\n\n3. **Potential Threats:**\n   - The enemy snake Snake #0 is positioned at **(2, 4)** with a short body of size 2.

Invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Move Analysis and Decision**\n\nMoving **UP** is the most efficient and safe choice. It allows me to claim the apple at **(6, 8)** while setting myself up for flexibility to plan my next moves. This move is risk-free and grows my snake length without deviating from a strong central position.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- **Reassess Board State:**\n  - After eating the **(6, 8)** apple, new apples may appear on the board. My next priority will depend on the proximity of newly spawned apples.\n  - If no apples spawn nearby, the next logical target will likely be **(3, 8)** or **(8, 4)** based on relative distances and pathing ease.\n- **Stay Alert:** Maintain awareness of Snake #0\u2019s movements, especially if it grows longer and gains access to closer apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**. It makes sense to continue moving in this direction. The other apples are farther and would take longer to reach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Assessing the enemy snake (Snake #0)**\n- Snake #0 is still at **(1, 0)**, and it has no body yet, so it can't block me. It is unlikely to interfere with my path toward (6, 4) for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Avoiding walls and staying safe**\n- My position is near the center of the board, so there is no immediate risk of hitting walls.\n- Aside from Snake #0, there is also minimal risk of running into danger. The next possible steps are all clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Path to (6, 4)**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, I need to either:\n\n- Go **RIGHT** (to move from x=5 to x=6), or  \n- Go **UP** (to move from y=2 to y=3).\n\n---\n\n#### **Which should I choose?**\n- **RIGHT** is the most direct move toward the apple (it reduces distance efficiently).  \n- **UP** would also help, but going UP first delays moving horizontal, which isn't optimal when the x-coordinate also needs adjustment quickly.  \n\nHence, **RIGHT** is the most logical next move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Reevaluating after this move**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I will be at **(6, 2)**. If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

Closest apple and directly within reach.  \n  2. **(6, 8):** 3 steps away (**UP, UP, UP**) after consuming **(6, 6)**. It\u2019s also along the same vertical trajectory, making it the second-best target.  \n  3. **(8, 4):** 2 steps away (**RIGHT, RIGHT**), but moving sideways risks less flexibility. Collecting this apple would take me off-track from **(6, 8)**, so I deprioritize it for now.  \n  4. **(2, 7):** Very far, at least 6 steps away, and low priority.  \n  5. **(9, 1):** The farthest apple and not a viable target at this time.\n\n- **Board State:**  \n  - My intended path is clear with **no threats or obstacles** along the route to **(6, 6)**.  \n  - Collecting **(6, 6)** aligns well with a vertical-focused strategy that maintains flexibility for pursuing future apples.  \n\n- **Enemy Snake:**  \n  - Snake #0 is still far away at **(2, 2)**, with its body at **[(1, 2)]**.  \n  - Poses **no immediate threat**, as it has no potential to intercept my target.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Move Analysis**\n\n1. **Option 1: Move UP**\n   - Moving **UP** to (6, 6) allows me to collect the nearby apple.  \n   - Growing in length adds (6, 5) to my body section, but it won\u2019t create a collision risk since the path ahead is completely clear.  \n   - Staying along the **6-column** keeps me positioned for **(6, 8)** as my likely next target.  \n\n2. **Other Moves (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN):**  \n   - Any movement other than **UP** would not make sense because:  \n     - **LEFT/DOWN**: Leads me away from the apples and wastes time.  \n     - **RIGHT**: Moving right towards **(8, 4)** would put me off-track from the vertical line targeting **(6, 8)**. This would be inefficient given my current position.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategic Considerations**\n\n- **Collecting one apple at a time is the most efficient strategy.**  \n  - The close proximity of **(6, 6)** and **(6, 8)** makes them natural consecutive targets for this turn and the next.\n  - Positioning myself centrally by remaining in the center of the board (column 6) provides flexibility after collecting these apples, especially if new apples spawn elsewhere.  \n- **Safety First:**  \n  - The board remains open and clear of obstacles, walls, or enemy snakes, meaning my path is safe and predictable for now.  \n- **Future Apple Collection:**  \n  - Once I consume **(6, 6)**, I will likely move **UP** toward **(6, 8)**, unless a closer or more accessible apple appears on the board.  \n  - The apple at **(8, 4)** could become a mid-term target once the **(6-column)** apples are collected.  \n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- After collecting **(6, 6)** this turn, immediately assess the apple locations and prioritize moving toward **(6, 8)** unless a new, closer apple spawns. Continue moving vertically where possible to stay efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

This is the closest apple and directly in my vertical path. The next most logical move is to head toward this apple.\n  2. **(3, 8):** 5 steps away (**LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP**) and not within a close trajectory.\n  3. **(8, 4):** Also far at 4 steps (**RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN**) and not efficiently reachable from my current position.\n  4. **(2, 7):** 7 steps away and irrelevant for now.\n  5. **(9, 1):** Still farthest and undeserving of attention.\n\n- **Board Clarity:**\n  - The **(6-column)** remains wide open with **no immediate threats or obstacles**.\n  - Consuming **(6, 8)** will extend my length and leave my tail still trailing in the column below (**6, 5 -> 6, 6 -> 6, 7 -> 6, 8**). This setup keeps me aligned for efficient movement.\n\n- **Enemy Snake:**\n  - Snake #0 presents no immediate danger as it hasn\u2019t moved significantly. It is too far from my path to pose any interference while I head toward **(6, 8)**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Move Analysis**\n\n1. **Option 1: Move UP**\n   - Moving **UP** from (6, 6) to (6, 7) is the most natural option.\n   - It positions me 1 step away from **(6, 8)** without deviating from a clear upward trajectory.\n   - This move avoids risk, maximizes efficiency toward the next apple, and maintains flexibility to reassess new apple spawns after reaching **(6, 8)**.\n\n---\n\n2. **Other Moves:**\n   - **LEFT:** Places me at (5, 6), moving away from any useful apple. This wastes time and risks unnecessary inefficiency.\n   - **RIGHT:** Places me at (7, 6), veering me toward **(8, 4)**. However, this leaves the far closer apple **(6, 8)** unchecked.\n   - **DOWN:** Takes me back toward my body at (6, 5), resulting in **self-collision** and immediate death. This is invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategy for Future Moves**\n\n- **Stay on the (6-column):**\n  - Consuming **(6, 8)** will lengthen my body without compromising my ability to move freely. \n  - Once I achieve that, I remain centralized and flexible to explore nearby targets. If no apples spawn nearby, **(8, 4)** may become the next mid-term goal, given that Snake #0 is far removed from my immediate vicinity.\n\n- **Maintain Safety First:** \n  - My attention should stay focused on avoiding narrow spaces as my length increases. Vertical and horizontal positioning to the center offers the best flexibility to adapt to new spawns or competing snakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**\n\nNext Turn Strategy: After reaching (6, 7) with the **UP** move, I will reassess the situation and most likely proceed to **(6, 8)** unless new apple positions drastically change my immediate strategy."

This apple is the closest and the most logical next goal to continue growing efficiently and safely.\n  2. **(3, 8):** **4 steps away** (**LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP**) and less optimal since it's farther and not vertically aligned.\n  3. **(8, 4):** **5 steps away** (**RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN**) and not reachable without going off my current efficient path.\n  4. **(2, 7):** **7 steps away**, entirely on the other side of the board and irrelevant for the moment.\n  5. **(9, 1):** **Even farther** and does not affect current decisions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Gameboard Observations**\n\n1. **Apple at (6, 8):**\n   - This apple is **1 step away**, making it the obvious next move. By moving **UP**, I will not only claim the apple but also grow my snake while keeping my position centralized and safe.\n\n2. **Future Pathing After (6, 8):**\n   - After consuming the apple, my finalized body positions will be:\n     - Head at **(6, 8)**\n     - Body at **[(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]**\n   - This setup keeps my snake safely centralized in the **6-column**, and I'll have room to maneuver freely based on new apple spawns.\n\n3. **Potential Threats:**\n   - The enemy snake Snake #0 is positioned at **(2, 4)** with a short body of size 2.

The enemy's nearest apple targets are **(2, 7)** or **(3, 8)**, keeping it focused farther from my own trajectory.\n   - No walls or self-collision risks exist for this move either.\n\n4. **Other Moves Analysis:**\n   - **LEFT (5, 7):**\n     - Inefficient as it moves me farther from my primary goal.\n   - **RIGHT (7, 7):**\n     - While this stays central, it diverts me from the proximal apple at **(6, 8)**.\n   - **DOWN (6, 6):**\n     - Results in immediate **self-collision** and death. Invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Move Analysis and Decision**\n\nMoving **UP** is the most efficient and safe choice. It allows me to claim the apple at **(6, 8)** while setting myself up for flexibility to plan my next moves. This move is risk-free and grows my snake length without deviating from a strong central position.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- **Reassess Board State:**\n  - After eating the **(6, 8)** apple, new apples may appear on the board. My next priority will depend on the proximity of newly spawned apples.\n  - If no apples spawn nearby, the next logical target will likely be **(3, 8)** or **(8, 4)** based on relative distances and pathing ease.\n- **Stay Alert:** Maintain awareness of Snake #0\u2019s movements, especially if it grows longer and gains access to closer apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**. It makes sense to continue moving in this direction. The other apples are farther and would take longer to reach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Assessing the enemy snake (Snake #0)**\n- Snake #0 is still at **(1, 0)**, and it has no body yet, so it can't block me. It is unlikely to interfere with my path toward (6, 4) for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Avoiding walls and staying safe**\n- My position is near the center of the board, so there is no immediate risk of hitting walls.\n- Aside from Snake #0, there is also minimal risk of running into danger. The next possible steps are all clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Path to (6, 4)**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, I need to either:\n\n- Go **RIGHT** (to move from x=5 to x=6), or  \n- Go **UP** (to move from y=2 to y=3).\n\n---\n\n#### **Which should I choose?**\n- **RIGHT** is the most direct move toward the apple (it reduces distance efficiently).  \n- **UP** would also help, but going UP first delays moving horizontal, which isn't optimal when the x-coordinate also needs adjustment quickly.  \n\nHence, **RIGHT** is the most logical next move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Reevaluating after this move**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I will be at **(6, 2)**. If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

(6, 6) \u2192 **2 steps** away (**UP, UP**). Best option based on proximity.  \n  2. (6, 8) \u2192 4 steps away (**UP, UP, UP, UP depending on direction safety).**  \n  3. (8, 4) \u2192 2 steps to the **RIGHT**, but slightly riskier if I stray too far horizontally for choke points.  \n  4. (2, 7) \u2192 8 steps away and not within immediate reach.  \n  5. (9, 1) \u2192 Very far and low-priority.\n\n- **Enemy Snake:**  \n  - **Position:** (1, 2) with body at [(0, 2)].  \n  - Poses **no immediate threat** due to its distance from me and its movements along the opposite side of the board.  \n\n- **Board Safety:**  \n  - I\u2019m in the center of the board and have no immediate obstacles, walls, or body segments blocking my immediate paths.  \n  - Moving **UP** keeps me close to the middle of the board while safely approaching the next apple at (6, 6).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Apple Priority Analysis**\n1. **(6, 6)** is the closest apple. Moving toward this apple is logical as it\u2019s along a straight path with no obstacles, hazards, or detours.  \n2. After consuming **(6, 6)**, the next logical target will likely be **(6, 8)**, as it remains along an upward trajectory and closer than all other apples.  \n3. Although **(8, 4)** is just 2 steps away to the right, pursuing it would force me to veer horizontally and risk limiting my movement flexibility in the long term.  \n\nConclusion: **Moving UP to (6, 5)** positions me to collect the apple at **(6, 6)** efficiently, while maintaining flexibility for my next move.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategic Analysis**\n- **Path to (6, 6):**\n  - Safe to move **UP** twice (to **(6, 5)** and then **(6, 6)**).  \n  - No nearby obstacles or threats along this path.  \n\n- **Future Planning:**\n  - Once at **(6, 6)**, recalibrate based on new apple spawns. Focus on staying centralized and maximizing safe paths to remaining apples.\n  - Remaining vertically aligned (**column 6**) ensures I have flexibility to branch out to the left or right for other apples as needed.  \n\n- **Enemy Snake Monitor:**  \n  - The enemy snake (Snake #0) is not close enough to threaten me. I will continue to monitor its position but won\u2019t need to adjust my strategy based on its actions just yet.  \n\n---\n\n### **Decision:** **UP**\n\n- **Rationale:** Moving **UP to (6, 5)** keeps me on track to collect the apple at **(6, 6)** safely and efficiently while maintaining flexibility for the next turn.  \n- **Next-Turn Plan:** If no new apples spawn significantly closer than **(6, 6)**, continue moving **UP** to collect it. Afterward, re-evaluate paths to remaining apples, prioritizing **(6, 8)** unless other options become safer or shorter.\n\n--- \n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

This would be inefficient given my current position.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategic Considerations**\n\n- **Collecting one apple at a time is the most efficient strategy.**  \n  - The close proximity of **(6, 6)** and **(6, 8)** makes them natural consecutive targets for this turn and the next.\n  - Positioning myself centrally by remaining in the center of the board (column 6) provides flexibility after collecting these apples, especially if new apples spawn elsewhere.  \n- **Safety First:**  \n  - The board remains open and clear of obstacles, walls, or enemy snakes, meaning my path is safe and predictable for now.  \n- **Future Apple Collection:**  \n  - Once I consume **(6, 6)**, I will likely move **UP** toward **(6, 8)**, unless a closer or more accessible apple appears on the board.  \n  - The apple at **(8, 4)** could become a mid-term target once the **(6-column)** apples are collected.  \n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- After collecting **(6, 6)** this turn, immediately assess the apple locations and prioritize moving toward **(6, 8)** unless a new, closer apple spawns.

This wastes time and risks unnecessary inefficiency.\n   - **RIGHT:** Places me at (7, 6), veering me toward **(8, 4)**. However, this leaves the far closer apple **(6, 8)** unchecked.\n   - **DOWN:** Takes me back toward my body at (6, 5), resulting in **self-collision** and immediate death. This is invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategy for Future Moves**\n\n- **Stay on the (6-column):**\n  - Consuming **(6, 8)** will lengthen my body without compromising my ability to move freely. \n  - Once I achieve that, I remain centralized and flexible to explore nearby targets. If no apples spawn nearby, **(8, 4)** may become the next mid-term goal, given that Snake #0 is far removed from my immediate vicinity.\n\n- **Maintain Safety First:** \n  - My attention should stay focused on avoiding narrow spaces as my length increases. Vertical and horizontal positioning to the center offers the best flexibility to adapt to new spawns or competing snakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**\n\nNext Turn Strategy: After reaching (6, 7) with the **UP** move, I will reassess the situation and most likely proceed to **(6, 8)** unless new apple positions drastically change my immediate strategy."

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**.

If no apples spawn nearby, **(8, 4)** may become the next mid-term goal, given that Snake #0 is far removed from my immediate vicinity.\n\n- **Maintain Safety First:** \n  - My attention should stay focused on avoiding narrow spaces as my length increases. Vertical and horizontal positioning to the center offers the best flexibility to adapt to new spawns or competing snakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**\n\nNext Turn Strategy: After reaching (6, 7) with the **UP** move, I will reassess the situation and most likely proceed to **(6, 8)** unless new apple positions drastically change my immediate strategy."

This apple is the closest and the most logical next goal to continue growing efficiently and safely.\n  2. **(3, 8):** **4 steps away** (**LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP**) and less optimal since it's farther and not vertically aligned.\n  3. **(8, 4):** **5 steps away** (**RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN**) and not reachable without going off my current efficient path.\n  4. **(2, 7):** **7 steps away**, entirely on the other side of the board and irrelevant for the moment.\n  5. **(9, 1):** **Even farther** and does not affect current decisions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Gameboard Observations**\n\n1. **Apple at (6, 8):**\n   - This apple is **1 step away**, making it the obvious next move. By moving **UP**, I will not only claim the apple but also grow my snake while keeping my position centralized and safe.\n\n2. **Future Pathing After (6, 8):**\n   - After consuming the apple, my finalized body positions will be:\n     - Head at **(6, 8)**\n     - Body at **[(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]**\n   - This setup keeps my snake safely centralized in the **6-column**, and I'll have room to maneuver freely based on new apple spawns.\n\n3. **Potential Threats:**\n   - The enemy snake Snake #0 is positioned at **(2, 4)** with a short body of size 2. It has no direct path to interfere with my movement at this time. The enemy's nearest apple targets are **(2, 7)** or **(3, 8)**, keeping it focused farther from my own trajectory.\n   - No walls or self-collision risks exist for this move either.\n\n4. **Other Moves Analysis:**\n   - **LEFT (5, 7):**\n     - Inefficient as it moves me farther from my primary goal.\n   - **RIGHT (7, 7):**\n     - While this stays central, it diverts me from the proximal apple at **(6, 8)**.\n   - **DOWN (6, 6):**\n     - Results in immediate **self-collision** and death. Invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Move Analysis and Decision**\n\nMoving **UP** is the most efficient and safe choice. It allows me to claim the apple at **(6, 8)** while setting myself up for flexibility to plan my next moves. This move is risk-free and grows my snake length without deviating from a strong central position.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- **Reassess Board State:**\n  - After eating the **(6, 8)** apple, new apples may appear on the board. My next priority will depend on the proximity of newly spawned apples.\n  - If no apples spawn nearby, the next logical target will likely be **(3, 8)** or **(8, 4)** based on relative distances and pathing ease.\n- **Stay Alert:** Maintain awareness of Snake #0\u2019s movements, especially if it grows longer and gains access to closer apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

My snake has grown by 1 unit, and I have gained a point.  \n\n2. **Enemy Snake (#0):**\n   - **Current Head Position:** (1, 7)  \n   - **Current Body:** [(2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)]  \n   - Snake #0 is still positioned near the apple at (1, 2). Its trajectory suggests that it does not currently threaten me.\n\n3. **Apples Remaining:**\n   - (1, 2): Closest apple but heavily contested by Snake #0.  \n   - (8, 4), (9, 1), (9, 0): All these apples remain far away. Pursuing them will require a long detour, so they will likely be future mid-to-long-term targets depending on their accessibility.\n\n4. **Safe Paths:**\n   - My current position (head at 3, 8) is generally safe and not at risk of collision.\n   - I need to plan an efficient path toward the next apple while avoiding dangerous zones, such as proximity to Snake #0 or my own snake\u2019s body.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Target Apple Evaluation**\n\n1. **(1, 2):**\n   - **Distance:** The apple is at least **6 steps away** according to shortest paths.\n   - **Contest:** Snake #0 is much closer to this apple, making it unlikely that I can secure it unless I take significant risks.\n   - **Priority Level:** LOW. It is contested and not worth the risk.\n\n2. **(8, 4):**\n   - **Distance:** The apple is at least **7 moves away.**\n   - **Contest:** No immediate competition; both Snake #0 and I are far from this apple.\n   - **Priority Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH. This apple should be my next target after careful navigation.\n\n3. **(9, 1), (9, 0):**\n   - **Distance:** These apples are significantly far away (10+ moves).\n   - **Contest:** Same as (8, 4); nobody is currently near these apples.\n   - **Priority Level:** LOW-MEDIUM. These could be considered much later.\n\n4. **Other Considerations:**\n   - Since I\u2019ve grown in size, maneuverability is slightly reduced. This means long-term planning is crucial to avoid collisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Move Options Evaluation**\n\nNow that (3, 8) has been consumed, my primary goal is to chart a course toward the next apple **(8, 4)** while maintaining a safe position and avoiding collisions.\n\n1. **UP (3, 9):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me toward the top wall, away from my body and all apples.\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Relatively safe movement.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No efficiency toward target apples.\n     - Limits future options by heading into a constrained area near the top wall.\n\n2. **DOWN (3, 7):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me closer to my own body while heading slightly nearer to the path toward (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps a relatively central position and starts positioning for (8, 4).\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Moves into proximity with my own body, making future paths slightly more difficult.\n\n3. **LEFT (2, 8):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me directly along my own body segment and slightly closer to Snake #0 (danger zone).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps options open for future moves.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Risky, as it brings me closer to Snake #0 and does not immediately reposition me toward (8, 4).\n\n4. **RIGHT (4, 8):**\n   - **Outcome:** Backtracks into my own body and causes a self-collision.\n   - **INVALID OPTION.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Decision**\n\nThe best move here is **DOWN (3, 7)**:\n- Safely navigates away from the top wall, keeping options open to pursue apples in the lower or rightward regions of the board.\n- Starts positioning me more centrally to eventually target (8, 4).\n- Avoids hazards and maintains a clear path for further maneuvering.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n1. **Continue toward (8, 4):**  \n   - After moving DOWN, I will evaluate the board for an efficient route.\n   - If competition arises, pivot toward a safer apple.\n\n2. **Stay Central for Flexibility:**  \n   - As my snake grows, careful positioning will reduce risks. I will avoid getting too close to walls or my own body.\n\n3. **Monitor Snake #0 Closely:**  \n   - If it starts moving toward (8, 4), I must adjust my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:** DOWN"

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**. It makes sense to continue moving in this direction. The other apples are farther and would take longer to reach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Assessing the enemy snake (Snake #0)**\n- Snake #0 is still at **(1, 0)**, and it has no body yet, so it can't block me. It is unlikely to interfere with my path toward (6, 4) for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Avoiding walls and staying safe**\n- My position is near the center of the board, so there is no immediate risk of hitting walls.\n- Aside from Snake #0, there is also minimal risk of running into danger. The next possible steps are all clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Path to (6, 4)**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, I need to either:\n\n- Go **RIGHT** (to move from x=5 to x=6), or  \n- Go **UP** (to move from y=2 to y=3).\n\n---\n\n#### **Which should I choose?**\n- **RIGHT** is the most direct move toward the apple (it reduces distance efficiently).  \n- **UP** would also help, but going UP first delays moving horizontal, which isn't optimal when the x-coordinate also needs adjustment quickly.  \n\nHence, **RIGHT** is the most logical next move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Reevaluating after this move**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I will be at **(6, 2)**. If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

My immediate goal should be to move centrally and closer to the apple at (8, 4) while steering clear of enemy bodies and walls.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Move Options Evaluation**\n\nAt (3, 7), I will evaluate the four available moves:\n\n#### **Option 1: UP (3, 8)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves back into my own body.\n   - **Invalid Move:** Results in self-collision.\n\n#### **Option 2: DOWN (3, 6)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me downward, keeping me safely central and positioning me closer to the apple (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps me away from walls and opens up future pathways toward (8, 4).\n     - Avoids Snake #0\u2019s current trajectory entirely.\n   - **Cons:**  \n     - Moving down takes me slightly farther from the center of the board, making maneuverability slightly harder long-term if I\u2019m not careful.\n\n#### **Option 3: LEFT (2, 7)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me closer to the body of Snake #0, potentially entering a contested region where Snake #0 might move.\n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Keeps me central and flexible if I decide to pivot toward another target.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Greater risk of confrontation with Snake #0.\n     - The move does not progress me toward (8, 4) and increases risk of hazards from enemy snakes.\n\n#### **Option 4: RIGHT (4, 7)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me toward the open space on the right side of the board, allowing me to initiate a path toward (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Safely positions me away from Snake #0.\n     - Progresses me meaningfully toward the target apple (8, 4).\n     - Maintains good positioning for long-term flexibility.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No immediate risks, but slight inefficiency in reaching the apple compared to moving downward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Decision**\nAfter evaluating my current position and the board state, the best move here is **RIGHT (4, 7)**:\n1. It creates a safe path toward (8, 4) while avoiding conflict with Snake #0.  \n2. It positions me more centrally, which gives me flexibility to pivot if Snake #0 or other constraints arise.\n3. It avoids collisions with my own body and keeps me away from the walls, ensuring better long-term flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n1. Continue progressing toward the apple at (8, 4) while maintaining a safe position.\n2. Monitor the movement of Snake #0 to ensure its trajectory does not interfere with mine.\n3. Avoid approaching apples that are heavily contested or too far from my current position.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:** RIGHT"

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**.

The next possible steps are all clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Path to (6, 4)**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, I need to either:\n\n- Go **RIGHT** (to move from x=5 to x=6), or  \n- Go **UP** (to move from y=2 to y=3).\n\n---\n\n#### **Which should I choose?**\n- **RIGHT** is the most direct move toward the apple (it reduces distance efficiently).  \n- **UP** would also help, but going UP first delays moving horizontal, which isn't optimal when the x-coordinate also needs adjustment quickly.  \n\nHence, **RIGHT** is the most logical next move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Reevaluating after this move**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I will be at **(6, 2)**. If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

It creates a safe path toward (8, 4) while avoiding conflict with Snake #0.  \n2. It positions me more centrally, which gives me flexibility to pivot if Snake #0 or other constraints arise.\n3. It avoids collisions with my own body and keeps me away from the walls, ensuring better long-term flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n1. Continue progressing toward the apple at (8, 4) while maintaining a safe position.\n2. Monitor the movement of Snake #0 to ensure its trajectory does not interfere with mine.\n3. Avoid approaching apples that are heavily contested or too far from my current position.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:** RIGHT"

While Snake #0 could compete for nearby apples, it is still far from my direct path. Its current positioning does not pose an immediate threat to me.\n\n3. **Apples Remaining:**\n   - **(8, 4):** Still my optimal apple. No immediate competitors are near it, and it\u2019s a reasonable distance from my current position.\n   - **(1, 2):** Snake #0 may contest this apple due to proximity.

Not an option.\n\n#### **Option 2: DOWN (4, 6)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me downward, aligning with a clearer path toward the apple at (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Brings me closer to (8, 4).  \n     - Maintains safe central positioning, with plenty of open space around for future maneuvers.  \n     - Avoids all potential conflicts with Snake #0, which is far from this path.  \n   - **Cons:**  \n     - None immediately apparent. This move addresses all strategic concerns while advancing significantly toward my key target.  \n\n#### **Option 3: LEFT (3, 7)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me left, retracing against my previous path.\n   - **Invalid Move:** Causes a backtracking self-collision. Not an option.\n\n#### **Option 4: RIGHT (5, 7)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me toward the right side of the board, maintaining distance from Snake #0 while keeping me central.  \n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Positions me closer to the apple at (8, 4).  \n     - Maintains flexibility for future moves due to the open board on the right-hand side.  \n   - **Cons:**  \n     - Although safe, this move is less direct compared to moving downward (4, 6). It makes slightly slower progress toward my target apple.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Decision**\n**DOWN (4, 6)** is the strongest move for this turn:  \n1. It meaningfully progresses me toward the apple at (8, 4).  \n2. It keeps me in a relatively central and open position, allowing for maximum flexibility in future turns.  \n3. It avoids all possible hazards, including walls, my own body, and the path of Snake #0.\n\n**RIGHT (5, 7)** is also a viable move, but it is slightly less direct and efficient than moving downward.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n1. Confirm Snake #0\u2019s trajectory in its turn to anticipate any potential competition for apples.  \n2. Continue advancing toward (8, 4), prioritizing safety while monitoring the board state for new or emerging risks.  \n3. Avoid overcommitting into unsafe regions, and always leave myself a clear escape path.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:** DOWN"

This is exactly what I planned in my last move.\n\nLet me quickly check for any dangers:\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 1) will put me at the apple location\n- Enemy snake is at (6, 1), which is far away horizontally on the same row\n- No risk of hitting walls or other obstacles\n- This will be my first apple, giving me my first point and making my snake grow\n\nAfter I collect this apple at (0, 1), I should plan my next target:\n- (6, 4) - from (0, 1) that would be 6 right + 3 up = 9 moves\n- (2, 7) - from (0, 1) that would be 2 right + 6 up = 8 moves  \n- (9, 1) - from (0, 1) that would be 9 right + 0 up = 9 moves\n- (6, 6) - from (0, 1) that would be 6 right + 5 up = 11 moves\n\nThe apple at (2, 7) looks like the next best target at 8 moves away.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (0, 1), I'll have a body segment and need to be more careful about movement. I should head toward the apple at (2, 7) as my next target, probably moving RIGHT and UP to get there efficiently.\n\nLEFT"

If no apples spawn nearby, **(8, 4)** may become the next mid-term goal, given that Snake #0 is far removed from my immediate vicinity.\n\n- **Maintain Safety First:** \n  - My attention should stay focused on avoiding narrow spaces as my length increases. Vertical and horizontal positioning to the center offers the best flexibility to adapt to new spawns or competing snakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**\n\nNext Turn Strategy: After reaching (6, 7) with the **UP** move, I will reassess the situation and most likely proceed to **(6, 8)** unless new apple positions drastically change my immediate strategy."

This apple is the closest and the most logical next goal to continue growing efficiently and safely.\n  2. **(3, 8):** **4 steps away** (**LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP**) and less optimal since it's farther and not vertically aligned.\n  3. **(8, 4):** **5 steps away** (**RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN**) and not reachable without going off my current efficient path.\n  4. **(2, 7):** **7 steps away**, entirely on the other side of the board and irrelevant for the moment.\n  5. **(9, 1):** **Even farther** and does not affect current decisions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Gameboard Observations**\n\n1. **Apple at (6, 8):**\n   - This apple is **1 step away**, making it the obvious next move. By moving **UP**, I will not only claim the apple but also grow my snake while keeping my position centralized and safe.\n\n2. **Future Pathing After (6, 8):**\n   - After consuming the apple, my finalized body positions will be:\n     - Head at **(6, 8)**\n     - Body at **[(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]**\n   - This setup keeps my snake safely centralized in the **6-column**, and I'll have room to maneuver freely based on new apple spawns.\n\n3. **Potential Threats:**\n   - The enemy snake Snake #0 is positioned at **(2, 4)** with a short body of size 2. It has no direct path to interfere with my movement at this time. The enemy's nearest apple targets are **(2, 7)** or **(3, 8)**, keeping it focused farther from my own trajectory.\n   - No walls or self-collision risks exist for this move either.\n\n4. **Other Moves Analysis:**\n   - **LEFT (5, 7):**\n     - Inefficient as it moves me farther from my primary goal.\n   - **RIGHT (7, 7):**\n     - While this stays central, it diverts me from the proximal apple at **(6, 8)**.\n   - **DOWN (6, 6):**\n     - Results in immediate **self-collision** and death. Invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Move Analysis and Decision**\n\nMoving **UP** is the most efficient and safe choice. It allows me to claim the apple at **(6, 8)** while setting myself up for flexibility to plan my next moves. This move is risk-free and grows my snake length without deviating from a strong central position.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- **Reassess Board State:**\n  - After eating the **(6, 8)** apple, new apples may appear on the board. My next priority will depend on the proximity of newly spawned apples.\n  - If no apples spawn nearby, the next logical target will likely be **(3, 8)** or **(8, 4)** based on relative distances and pathing ease.\n- **Stay Alert:** Maintain awareness of Snake #0\u2019s movements, especially if it grows longer and gains access to closer apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

My snake has grown by 1 unit, and I have gained a point.  \n\n2. **Enemy Snake (#0):**\n   - **Current Head Position:** (1, 7)  \n   - **Current Body:** [(2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)]  \n   - Snake #0 is still positioned near the apple at (1, 2). Its trajectory suggests that it does not currently threaten me.\n\n3. **Apples Remaining:**\n   - (1, 2): Closest apple but heavily contested by Snake #0.  \n   - (8, 4), (9, 1), (9, 0): All these apples remain far away. Pursuing them will require a long detour, so they will likely be future mid-to-long-term targets depending on their accessibility.\n\n4. **Safe Paths:**\n   - My current position (head at 3, 8) is generally safe and not at risk of collision.\n   - I need to plan an efficient path toward the next apple while avoiding dangerous zones, such as proximity to Snake #0 or my own snake\u2019s body.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Target Apple Evaluation**\n\n1. **(1, 2):**\n   - **Distance:** The apple is at least **6 steps away** according to shortest paths.\n   - **Contest:** Snake #0 is much closer to this apple, making it unlikely that I can secure it unless I take significant risks.\n   - **Priority Level:** LOW. It is contested and not worth the risk.\n\n2. **(8, 4):**\n   - **Distance:** The apple is at least **7 moves away.**\n   - **Contest:** No immediate competition; both Snake #0 and I are far from this apple.\n   - **Priority Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH. This apple should be my next target after careful navigation.\n\n3. **(9, 1), (9, 0):**\n   - **Distance:** These apples are significantly far away (10+ moves).\n   - **Contest:** Same as (8, 4); nobody is currently near these apples.\n   - **Priority Level:** LOW-MEDIUM. These could be considered much later.\n\n4. **Other Considerations:**\n   - Since I\u2019ve grown in size, maneuverability is slightly reduced. This means long-term planning is crucial to avoid collisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Move Options Evaluation**\n\nNow that (3, 8) has been consumed, my primary goal is to chart a course toward the next apple **(8, 4)** while maintaining a safe position and avoiding collisions.\n\n1. **UP (3, 9):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me toward the top wall, away from my body and all apples.\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Relatively safe movement.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No efficiency toward target apples.\n     - Limits future options by heading into a constrained area near the top wall.\n\n2. **DOWN (3, 7):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me closer to my own body while heading slightly nearer to the path toward (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps a relatively central position and starts positioning for (8, 4).\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Moves into proximity with my own body, making future paths slightly more difficult.\n\n3. **LEFT (2, 8):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me directly along my own body segment and slightly closer to Snake #0 (danger zone).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps options open for future moves.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Risky, as it brings me closer to Snake #0 and does not immediately reposition me toward (8, 4).\n\n4. **RIGHT (4, 8):**\n   - **Outcome:** Backtracks into my own body and causes a self-collision.\n   - **INVALID OPTION.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Decision**\n\nThe best move here is **DOWN (3, 7)**:\n- Safely navigates away from the top wall, keeping options open to pursue apples in the lower or rightward regions of the board.\n- Starts positioning me more centrally to eventually target (8, 4).\n- Avoids hazards and maintains a clear path for further maneuvering.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n1. **Continue toward (8, 4):**  \n   - After moving DOWN, I will evaluate the board for an efficient route.\n   - If competition arises, pivot toward a safer apple.\n\n2. **Stay Central for Flexibility:**  \n   - As my snake grows, careful positioning will reduce risks. I will avoid getting too close to walls or my own body.\n\n3. **Monitor Snake #0 Closely:**  \n   - If it starts moving toward (8, 4), I must adjust my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:** DOWN"

Its current path direction indicates that it is not directly threatening me, but it could potentially move toward the apple at (1, 2).\n\n3. **Apples Remaining:**\n   - **(1, 2):** This is the closest apple but remains heavily contested by Snake #0. It\u2019s unlikely I can secure it without taking significant risks.\n   - **(8, 4):** This is the current priority apple. No immediate competition is near it, and my path can be safely aligned to pursue it.\n   - **(9, 1) & (9, 0):** These apples remain far away, and pursuing them now would be inefficient and dangerous due to proximity to walls.\n   - **(0, 9):** Far away on the top left. It is not a practical target at this time.\n\n4. **Current Board Observations:**\n   - My position is safe, but there are walls above and Snake #0 to the left of me. My immediate goal should be to move centrally and closer to the apple at (8, 4) while steering clear of enemy bodies and walls.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Move Options Evaluation**\n\nAt (3, 7), I will evaluate the four available moves:\n\n#### **Option 1: UP (3, 8)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves back into my own body.\n   - **Invalid Move:** Results in self-collision.\n\n#### **Option 2: DOWN (3, 6)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me downward, keeping me safely central and positioning me closer to the apple (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps me away from walls and opens up future pathways toward (8, 4).\n     - Avoids Snake #0\u2019s current trajectory entirely.\n   - **Cons:**  \n     - Moving down takes me slightly farther from the center of the board, making maneuverability slightly harder long-term if I\u2019m not careful.\n\n#### **Option 3: LEFT (2, 7)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me closer to the body of Snake #0, potentially entering a contested region where Snake #0 might move.\n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Keeps me central and flexible if I decide to pivot toward another target.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Greater risk of confrontation with Snake #0.\n     - The move does not progress me toward (8, 4) and increases risk of hazards from enemy snakes.\n\n#### **Option 4: RIGHT (4, 7)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me toward the open space on the right side of the board, allowing me to initiate a path toward (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Safely positions me away from Snake #0.\n     - Progresses me meaningfully toward the target apple (8, 4).\n     - Maintains good positioning for long-term flexibility.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No immediate risks, but slight inefficiency in reaching the apple compared to moving downward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Decision**\nAfter evaluating my current position and the board state, the best move here is **RIGHT (4, 7)**:\n1. It creates a safe path toward (8, 4) while avoiding conflict with Snake #0.  \n2. It positions me more centrally, which gives me flexibility to pivot if Snake #0 or other constraints arise.\n3. It avoids collisions with my own body and keeps me away from the walls, ensuring better long-term flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n1. Continue progressing toward the apple at (8, 4) while maintaining a safe position.\n2. Monitor the movement of Snake #0 to ensure its trajectory does not interfere with mine.\n3. Avoid approaching apples that are heavily contested or too far from my current position.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:** RIGHT"

While Snake #0 could compete for nearby apples, it is still far from my direct path. Its current positioning does not pose an immediate threat to me.\n\n3. **Apples Remaining:**\n   - **(8, 4):** Still my optimal apple.

This move addresses all strategic concerns while advancing significantly toward my key target.  \n\n#### **Option 3: LEFT (3, 7)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me left, retracing against my previous path.\n   - **Invalid Move:** Causes a backtracking self-collision. Not an option.\n\n#### **Option 4: RIGHT (5, 7)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me toward the right side of the board, maintaining distance from Snake #0 while keeping me central.  \n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Positions me closer to the apple at (8, 4).  \n     - Maintains flexibility for future moves due to the open board on the right-hand side.  \n   - **Cons:**  \n     - Although safe, this move is less direct compared to moving downward (4, 6).

It avoids all possible hazards, including walls, my own body, and the path of Snake #0.\n\n**RIGHT (5, 7)** is also a viable move, but it is slightly less direct and efficient than moving downward.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n1. Confirm Snake #0\u2019s trajectory in its turn to anticipate any potential competition for apples.  \n2. Continue advancing toward (8, 4), prioritizing safety while monitoring the board state for new or emerging risks.  \n3.

My snake\u2019s body is still empty ([ ]), as I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Analyzing the apples' positions and proximity**\nLet\u2019s calculate the distances from my new position:\n\n1. **Apple at (0, 1)**  \n   - 5 steps left, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **6 steps**\n   \n2. **Apple at (6, 4)**  \n   - 1 step right, 2 steps up \u2192 Total: **3 steps**\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 7)**  \n   - 3 steps left, 5 steps up \u2192 Total: **8 steps**\n\n4. **Apple at (9, 1)**  \n   - 4 steps right, 1 step down \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n5. **Apple at (6, 6)**  \n   - 1 step right, 4 steps up \u2192 Total: **5 steps**\n\n---\n\n#### **Closest Apple**\n- **The apple at (6, 4)** remains the closest at just **3 steps away**. It makes sense to continue moving in this direction. The other apples are farther and would take longer to reach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Assessing the enemy snake (Snake #0)**\n- Snake #0 is still at **(1, 0)**, and it has no body yet, so it can't block me.

The next possible steps are all clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Path to (6, 4)**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(6, 4)**, I need to either:\n\n- Go **RIGHT** (to move from x=5 to x=6), or  \n- Go **UP** (to move from y=2 to y=3).\n\n---\n\n#### **Which should I choose?**\n- **RIGHT** is the most direct move toward the apple (it reduces distance efficiently).  \n- **UP** would also help, but going UP first delays moving horizontal, which isn't optimal when the x-coordinate also needs adjustment quickly.  \n\nHence, **RIGHT** is the most logical next move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: **Reevaluating after this move**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I will be at **(6, 2)**. If enemy Snake #0 or environmental changes happen, I will reassess my plan (and apple priority) accordingly. For now, my goal stays focused on reaching (6, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT**"

It\u2019s also along the same vertical trajectory, making it the second-best target.  \n  3. **(8, 4):** 2 steps away (**RIGHT, RIGHT**), but moving sideways risks less flexibility. Collecting this apple would take me off-track from **(6, 8)**, so I deprioritize it for now.  \n  4. **(2, 7):** Very far, at least 6 steps away, and low priority.  \n  5. **(9, 1):** The farthest apple and not a viable target at this time.\n\n- **Board State:**  \n  - My intended path is clear with **no threats or obstacles** along the route to **(6, 6)**.  \n  - Collecting **(6, 6)** aligns well with a vertical-focused strategy that maintains flexibility for pursuing future apples.  \n\n- **Enemy Snake:**  \n  - Snake #0 is still far away at **(2, 2)**, with its body at **[(1, 2)]**.  \n  - Poses **no immediate threat**, as it has no potential to intercept my target.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Move Analysis**\n\n1. **Option 1: Move UP**\n   - Moving **UP** to (6, 6) allows me to collect the nearby apple.  \n   - Growing in length adds (6, 5) to my body section, but it won\u2019t create a collision risk since the path ahead is completely clear.  \n   - Staying along the **6-column** keeps me positioned for **(6, 8)** as my likely next target.  \n\n2. **Other Moves (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN):**  \n   - Any movement other than **UP** would not make sense because:  \n     - **LEFT/DOWN**: Leads me away from the apples and wastes time.  \n     - **RIGHT**: Moving right towards **(8, 4)** would put me off-track from the vertical line targeting **(6, 8)**. This would be inefficient given my current position.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategic Considerations**\n\n- **Collecting one apple at a time is the most efficient strategy.**  \n  - The close proximity of **(6, 6)** and **(6, 8)** makes them natural consecutive targets for this turn and the next.\n  - Positioning myself centrally by remaining in the center of the board (column 6) provides flexibility after collecting these apples, especially if new apples spawn elsewhere.  \n- **Safety First:**  \n  - The board remains open and clear of obstacles, walls, or enemy snakes, meaning my path is safe and predictable for now.  \n- **Future Apple Collection:**  \n  - Once I consume **(6, 6)**, I will likely move **UP** toward **(6, 8)**, unless a closer or more accessible apple appears on the board.  \n  - The apple at **(8, 4)** could become a mid-term target once the **(6-column)** apples are collected.  \n\n#### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- After collecting **(6, 6)** this turn, immediately assess the apple locations and prioritize moving toward **(6, 8)** unless a new, closer apple spawns. Continue moving vertically where possible to stay efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

This setup keeps me aligned for efficient movement.\n\n- **Enemy Snake:**\n  - Snake #0 presents no immediate danger as it hasn\u2019t moved significantly. It is too far from my path to pose any interference while I head toward **(6, 8)**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Move Analysis**\n\n1. **Option 1: Move UP**\n   - Moving **UP** from (6, 6) to (6, 7) is the most natural option.\n   - It positions me 1 step away from **(6, 8)** without deviating from a clear upward trajectory.\n   - This move avoids risk, maximizes efficiency toward the next apple, and maintains flexibility to reassess new apple spawns after reaching **(6, 8)**.\n\n---\n\n2. **Other Moves:**\n   - **LEFT:** Places me at (5, 6), moving away from any useful apple. This wastes time and risks unnecessary inefficiency.\n   - **RIGHT:** Places me at (7, 6), veering me toward **(8, 4)**. However, this leaves the far closer apple **(6, 8)** unchecked.\n   - **DOWN:** Takes me back toward my body at (6, 5), resulting in **self-collision** and immediate death. This is invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategy for Future Moves**\n\n- **Stay on the (6-column):**\n  - Consuming **(6, 8)** will lengthen my body without compromising my ability to move freely. \n  - Once I achieve that, I remain centralized and flexible to explore nearby targets. If no apples spawn nearby, **(8, 4)** may become the next mid-term goal, given that Snake #0 is far removed from my immediate vicinity.\n\n- **Maintain Safety First:** \n  - My attention should stay focused on avoiding narrow spaces as my length increases. Vertical and horizontal positioning to the center offers the best flexibility to adapt to new spawns or competing snakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**\n\nNext Turn Strategy: After reaching (6, 7) with the **UP** move, I will reassess the situation and most likely proceed to **(6, 8)** unless new apple positions drastically change my immediate strategy."

It allows me to claim the apple at **(6, 8)** while setting myself up for flexibility to plan my next moves. This move is risk-free and grows my snake length without deviating from a strong central position.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- **Reassess Board State:**\n  - After eating the **(6, 8)** apple, new apples may appear on the board. My next priority will depend on the proximity of newly spawned apples.\n  - If no apples spawn nearby, the next logical target will likely be **(3, 8)** or **(8, 4)** based on relative distances and pathing ease.\n- **Stay Alert:** Maintain awareness of Snake #0\u2019s movements, especially if it grows longer and gains access to closer apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

Pursuing them will require a long detour, so they will likely be future mid-to-long-term targets depending on their accessibility.\n\n4. **Safe Paths:**\n   - My current position (head at 3, 8) is generally safe and not at risk of collision.\n   - I need to plan an efficient path toward the next apple while avoiding dangerous zones, such as proximity to Snake #0 or my own snake\u2019s body.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Target Apple Evaluation**\n\n1. **(1, 2):**\n   - **Distance:** The apple is at least **6 steps away** according to shortest paths.\n   - **Contest:** Snake #0 is much closer to this apple, making it unlikely that I can secure it unless I take significant risks.\n   - **Priority Level:** LOW.

Keep moving rightward until closer to the target's x-coordinate.  \n2. Once aligned with the apple in the x-dimension, begin moving downward to reach (8, 4).  \n3.

This is the closest apple and directly in my vertical path. The next most logical move is to head toward this apple.\n  2. **(3, 8):** 5 steps away (**LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP**) and not within a close trajectory.\n  3. **(8, 4):** Also far at 4 steps (**RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN**) and not efficiently reachable from my current position.\n  4. **(2, 7):** 7 steps away and irrelevant for now.\n  5. **(9, 1):** Still farthest and undeserving of attention.\n\n- **Board Clarity:**\n  - The **(6-column)** remains wide open with **no immediate threats or obstacles**.\n  - Consuming **(6, 8)** will extend my length and leave my tail still trailing in the column below (**6, 5 -> 6, 6 -> 6, 7 -> 6, 8**). This setup keeps me aligned for efficient movement.\n\n- **Enemy Snake:**\n  - Snake #0 presents no immediate danger as it hasn\u2019t moved significantly. It is too far from my path to pose any interference while I head toward **(6, 8)**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Move Analysis**\n\n1. **Option 1: Move UP**\n   - Moving **UP** from (6, 6) to (6, 7) is the most natural option.\n   - It positions me 1 step away from **(6, 8)** without deviating from a clear upward trajectory.\n   - This move avoids risk, maximizes efficiency toward the next apple, and maintains flexibility to reassess new apple spawns after reaching **(6, 8)**.\n\n---\n\n2. **Other Moves:**\n   - **LEFT:** Places me at (5, 6), moving away from any useful apple. This wastes time and risks unnecessary inefficiency.\n   - **RIGHT:** Places me at (7, 6), veering me toward **(8, 4)**. However, this leaves the far closer apple **(6, 8)** unchecked.\n   - **DOWN:** Takes me back toward my body at (6, 5), resulting in **self-collision** and immediate death. This is invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Strategy for Future Moves**\n\n- **Stay on the (6-column):**\n  - Consuming **(6, 8)** will lengthen my body without compromising my ability to move freely. \n  - Once I achieve that, I remain centralized and flexible to explore nearby targets. If no apples spawn nearby, **(8, 4)** may become the next mid-term goal, given that Snake #0 is far removed from my immediate vicinity.\n\n- **Maintain Safety First:** \n  - My attention should stay focused on avoiding narrow spaces as my length increases. Vertical and horizontal positioning to the center offers the best flexibility to adapt to new spawns or competing snakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**\n\nNext Turn Strategy: After reaching (6, 7) with the **UP** move, I will reassess the situation and most likely proceed to **(6, 8)** unless new apple positions drastically change my immediate strategy."

This apple is the closest and the most logical next goal to continue growing efficiently and safely.\n  2. **(3, 8):** **4 steps away** (**LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP**) and less optimal since it's farther and not vertically aligned.\n  3. **(8, 4):** **5 steps away** (**RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN**) and not reachable without going off my current efficient path.\n  4. **(2, 7):** **7 steps away**, entirely on the other side of the board and irrelevant for the moment.\n  5. **(9, 1):** **Even farther** and does not affect current decisions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Gameboard Observations**\n\n1. **Apple at (6, 8):**\n   - This apple is **1 step away**, making it the obvious next move. By moving **UP**, I will not only claim the apple but also grow my snake while keeping my position centralized and safe.\n\n2. **Future Pathing After (6, 8):**\n   - After consuming the apple, my finalized body positions will be:\n     - Head at **(6, 8)**\n     - Body at **[(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]**\n   - This setup keeps my snake safely centralized in the **6-column**, and I'll have room to maneuver freely based on new apple spawns.\n\n3. **Potential Threats:**\n   - The enemy snake Snake #0 is positioned at **(2, 4)** with a short body of size 2. It has no direct path to interfere with my movement at this time. The enemy's nearest apple targets are **(2, 7)** or **(3, 8)**, keeping it focused farther from my own trajectory.\n   - No walls or self-collision risks exist for this move either.\n\n4. **Other Moves Analysis:**\n   - **LEFT (5, 7):**\n     - Inefficient as it moves me farther from my primary goal.\n   - **RIGHT (7, 7):**\n     - While this stays central, it diverts me from the proximal apple at **(6, 8)**.\n   - **DOWN (6, 6):**\n     - Results in immediate **self-collision** and death. Invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Move Analysis and Decision**\n\nMoving **UP** is the most efficient and safe choice. It allows me to claim the apple at **(6, 8)** while setting myself up for flexibility to plan my next moves. This move is risk-free and grows my snake length without deviating from a strong central position.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- **Reassess Board State:**\n  - After eating the **(6, 8)** apple, new apples may appear on the board. My next priority will depend on the proximity of newly spawned apples.\n  - If no apples spawn nearby, the next logical target will likely be **(3, 8)** or **(8, 4)** based on relative distances and pathing ease.\n- **Stay Alert:** Maintain awareness of Snake #0\u2019s movements, especially if it grows longer and gains access to closer apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

Let me check if this is safe.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at position (4, 8) with body at [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7)] - still quite far from me and not an immediate threat.\n\nLet me evaluate my movement options from (2, 7):\n- UP to (2, 8): Safe space, but no immediate apple\n- DOWN to (2, 6): Would hit my own body segment (my neck), so I'd die\n- LEFT to (1, 7): This is an apple! This would give me another point immediately\n- RIGHT to (3, 7): Safe space, but no immediate apple\n\nMoving LEFT to (1, 7) is clearly the best option because:\n1. It gets me another apple immediately (2nd point!)\n2. It's a safe move with no obstacles\n3. It keeps me growing and competitive\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (1, 7), I'll be at position (1, 7) with body at [(2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)]. From there, I can reassess. The apple at (3, 8) will still be accessible, and I'll have gained another point.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (1, 7), I'll have 2 points and a longer snake. I should then consider going for the apple at (3, 8) which will be reachable by going RIGHT and then UP, while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nLEFT"

My snake has grown by 1 unit, and I have gained a point.  \n\n2. **Enemy Snake (#0):**\n   - **Current Head Position:** (1, 7)  \n   - **Current Body:** [(2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)]  \n   - Snake #0 is still positioned near the apple at (1, 2). Its trajectory suggests that it does not currently threaten me.\n\n3. **Apples Remaining:**\n   - (1, 2): Closest apple but heavily contested by Snake #0.  \n   - (8, 4), (9, 1), (9, 0): All these apples remain far away. Pursuing them will require a long detour, so they will likely be future mid-to-long-term targets depending on their accessibility.\n\n4. **Safe Paths:**\n   - My current position (head at 3, 8) is generally safe and not at risk of collision.\n   - I need to plan an efficient path toward the next apple while avoiding dangerous zones, such as proximity to Snake #0 or my own snake\u2019s body.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Target Apple Evaluation**\n\n1. **(1, 2):**\n   - **Distance:** The apple is at least **6 steps away** according to shortest paths.\n   - **Contest:** Snake #0 is much closer to this apple, making it unlikely that I can secure it unless I take significant risks.\n   - **Priority Level:** LOW. It is contested and not worth the risk.\n\n2. **(8, 4):**\n   - **Distance:** The apple is at least **7 moves away.**\n   - **Contest:** No immediate competition; both Snake #0 and I are far from this apple.\n   - **Priority Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH. This apple should be my next target after careful navigation.\n\n3. **(9, 1), (9, 0):**\n   - **Distance:** These apples are significantly far away (10+ moves).\n   - **Contest:** Same as (8, 4); nobody is currently near these apples.\n   - **Priority Level:** LOW-MEDIUM. These could be considered much later.\n\n4. **Other Considerations:**\n   - Since I\u2019ve grown in size, maneuverability is slightly reduced. This means long-term planning is crucial to avoid collisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Move Options Evaluation**\n\nNow that (3, 8) has been consumed, my primary goal is to chart a course toward the next apple **(8, 4)** while maintaining a safe position and avoiding collisions.\n\n1. **UP (3, 9):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me toward the top wall, away from my body and all apples.\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Relatively safe movement.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No efficiency toward target apples.\n     - Limits future options by heading into a constrained area near the top wall.\n\n2. **DOWN (3, 7):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me closer to my own body while heading slightly nearer to the path toward (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps a relatively central position and starts positioning for (8, 4).\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Moves into proximity with my own body, making future paths slightly more difficult.\n\n3. **LEFT (2, 8):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me directly along my own body segment and slightly closer to Snake #0 (danger zone).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps options open for future moves.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Risky, as it brings me closer to Snake #0 and does not immediately reposition me toward (8, 4).\n\n4. **RIGHT (4, 8):**\n   - **Outcome:** Backtracks into my own body and causes a self-collision.\n   - **INVALID OPTION.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Decision**\n\nThe best move here is **DOWN (3, 7)**:\n- Safely navigates away from the top wall, keeping options open to pursue apples in the lower or rightward regions of the board.\n- Starts positioning me more centrally to eventually target (8, 4).\n- Avoids hazards and maintains a clear path for further maneuvering.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n1. **Continue toward (8, 4):**  \n   - After moving DOWN, I will evaluate the board for an efficient route.\n   - If competition arises, pivot toward a safer apple.\n\n2. **Stay Central for Flexibility:**  \n   - As my snake grows, careful positioning will reduce risks. I will avoid getting too close to walls or my own body.\n\n3. **Monitor Snake #0 Closely:**  \n   - If it starts moving toward (8, 4), I must adjust my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:** DOWN"

It avoids collisions with my own body and keeps me away from the walls, ensuring better long-term flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n1. Continue progressing toward the apple at (8, 4) while maintaining a safe position.\n2. Monitor the movement of Snake #0 to ensure its trajectory does not interfere with mine.\n3.

The board is still open near my path to (8, 4), but I need to stay vigilant for risks involving spacing and flexibility in case of unexpected moves.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating Moves**\n\nI am at position **(5, 6)** and reviewing the safest and most efficient options for moving toward my target apple at **(8, 4)**. My evaluation will prioritize minimization of risk while optimizing progress toward the target.\n\n#### **Option 1: UP (5, 7)**  \n   - **Outcome:** Invalid since my body occupies the position (4, 7). Moving up would result in a self-collision.\n\n#### **Option 2: DOWN (5, 5)**  \n   - **Outcome:** Moves me one space downward.  \n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Keeps me safe and away from walls, my own body, and Snake #0.  \n     - Keeps my y-coordinate closer to the apple's y-coordinate at (8, 4).  \n     - Avoids over-committing to the right too early, allowing flexibility to adjust later.  \n     - Avoids boxing myself into tighter spaces near the edge of the board.  \n   - **Cons:**  \n     - The x-distance to the apple (8, 4) remains the same for now. Progress is indirect.\n\n#### **Option 3: LEFT (4, 6)**  \n   - **Outcome:** Invalid since moving left would result in a self-collision.\n\n#### **Option 4: RIGHT (6, 6)**  \n   - **Outcome:** Moves me one step rightward.  \n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Advances my x-coordinate closer to the apple (8, 4).  \n     - Keeps my movement consistent with my previous path toward the target.  \n     - Avoids collisions and walls while staying in the open.  \n     - Progresses meaningfully toward the goal while allowing flexibility for future turns.  \n   - **Cons:**  \n     - Slightly distances me from the apple in terms of the y-coordinate (the apple is at a lower y-position (4)).\n\n#### **Comparing DOWN vs. RIGHT**\n- **DOWN:** An arguably safer move for flexibility in future turns but does not immediately progress toward the x-coordinate of the target.  \n- **RIGHT:** A direct advance toward the apple but slightly less flexible than DOWN, since it reduces options to adjust laterally.  \n- Given the current board state, **RIGHT is better since space is still available and the risk of overcommitment is low.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Decision**\n\nThe optimal move this turn is **RIGHT (6, 6)**:  \n- It makes direct progress toward my target.  \n- It keeps me in a safe and open region with no immediate threats.  \n- It leaves plenty of options for future decisions as I continue closing the distance to (8, 4).\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n1. Keep moving rightward until closer to the target's x-coordinate.  \n2. Once aligned with the apple in the x-dimension, begin moving downward to reach (8, 4).  \n3. Monitor Snake #0, though it is currently irrelevant to my path.  \n4. Be mindful that after eating (8, 4), my newly added tail segment might require longer decision sequences to avoid self-collision.\n\n---\n\n**Next Move:** **RIGHT**"

By moving **UP**, I will not only claim the apple but also grow my snake while keeping my position centralized and safe.\n\n2. **Future Pathing After (6, 8):**\n   - After consuming the apple, my finalized body positions will be:\n     - Head at **(6, 8)**\n     - Body at **[(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]**\n   - This setup keeps my snake safely centralized in the **6-column**, and I'll have room to maneuver freely based on new apple spawns.\n\n3. **Potential Threats:**\n   - The enemy snake Snake #0 is positioned at **(2, 4)** with a short body of size 2. It has no direct path to interfere with my movement at this time. The enemy's nearest apple targets are **(2, 7)** or **(3, 8)**, keeping it focused farther from my own trajectory.\n   - No walls or self-collision risks exist for this move either.\n\n4. **Other Moves Analysis:**\n   - **LEFT (5, 7):**\n     - Inefficient as it moves me farther from my primary goal.\n   - **RIGHT (7, 7):**\n     - While this stays central, it diverts me from the proximal apple at **(6, 8)**.\n   - **DOWN (6, 6):**\n     - Results in immediate **self-collision** and death. Invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Move Analysis and Decision**\n\nMoving **UP** is the most efficient and safe choice. It allows me to claim the apple at **(6, 8)** while setting myself up for flexibility to plan my next moves. This move is risk-free and grows my snake length without deviating from a strong central position.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- **Reassess Board State:**\n  - After eating the **(6, 8)** apple, new apples may appear on the board. My next priority will depend on the proximity of newly spawned apples.\n  - If no apples spawn nearby, the next logical target will likely be **(3, 8)** or **(8, 4)** based on relative distances and pathing ease.\n- **Stay Alert:** Maintain awareness of Snake #0\u2019s movements, especially if it grows longer and gains access to closer apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: UP**"

Pursuing them will require a long detour, so they will likely be future mid-to-long-term targets depending on their accessibility.\n\n4. **Safe Paths:**\n   - My current position (head at 3, 8) is generally safe and not at risk of collision.\n   - I need to plan an efficient path toward the next apple while avoiding dangerous zones, such as proximity to Snake #0 or my own snake\u2019s body.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Target Apple Evaluation**\n\n1. **(1, 2):**\n   - **Distance:** The apple is at least **6 steps away** according to shortest paths.\n   - **Contest:** Snake #0 is much closer to this apple, making it unlikely that I can secure it unless I take significant risks.\n   - **Priority Level:** LOW. It is contested and not worth the risk.\n\n2. **(8, 4):**\n   - **Distance:** The apple is at least **7 moves away.**\n   - **Contest:** No immediate competition; both Snake #0 and I are far from this apple.\n   - **Priority Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH. This apple should be my next target after careful navigation.\n\n3. **(9, 1), (9, 0):**\n   - **Distance:** These apples are significantly far away (10+ moves).\n   - **Contest:** Same as (8, 4); nobody is currently near these apples.\n   - **Priority Level:** LOW-MEDIUM. These could be considered much later.\n\n4. **Other Considerations:**\n   - Since I\u2019ve grown in size, maneuverability is slightly reduced. This means long-term planning is crucial to avoid collisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Move Options Evaluation**\n\nNow that (3, 8) has been consumed, my primary goal is to chart a course toward the next apple **(8, 4)** while maintaining a safe position and avoiding collisions.\n\n1. **UP (3, 9):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me toward the top wall, away from my body and all apples.\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Relatively safe movement.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No efficiency toward target apples.\n     - Limits future options by heading into a constrained area near the top wall.\n\n2. **DOWN (3, 7):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me closer to my own body while heading slightly nearer to the path toward (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps a relatively central position and starts positioning for (8, 4).\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Moves into proximity with my own body, making future paths slightly more difficult.\n\n3. **LEFT (2, 8):**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me directly along my own body segment and slightly closer to Snake #0 (danger zone).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps options open for future moves.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Risky, as it brings me closer to Snake #0 and does not immediately reposition me toward (8, 4).\n\n4. **RIGHT (4, 8):**\n   - **Outcome:** Backtracks into my own body and causes a self-collision.\n   - **INVALID OPTION.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Decision**\n\nThe best move here is **DOWN (3, 7)**:\n- Safely navigates away from the top wall, keeping options open to pursue apples in the lower or rightward regions of the board.\n- Starts positioning me more centrally to eventually target (8, 4).\n- Avoids hazards and maintains a clear path for further maneuvering.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n1. **Continue toward (8, 4):**  \n   - After moving DOWN, I will evaluate the board for an efficient route.\n   - If competition arises, pivot toward a safer apple.\n\n2. **Stay Central for Flexibility:**  \n   - As my snake grows, careful positioning will reduce risks. I will avoid getting too close to walls or my own body.\n\n3. **Monitor Snake #0 Closely:**  \n   - If it starts moving toward (8, 4), I must adjust my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:** DOWN"

Its current path direction indicates that it is not directly threatening me, but it could potentially move toward the apple at (1, 2).\n\n3. **Apples Remaining:**\n   - **(1, 2):** This is the closest apple but remains heavily contested by Snake #0. It\u2019s unlikely I can secure it without taking significant risks.\n   - **(8, 4):** This is the current priority apple. No immediate competition is near it, and my path can be safely aligned to pursue it.\n   - **(9, 1) & (9, 0):** These apples remain far away, and pursuing them now would be inefficient and dangerous due to proximity to walls.\n   - **(0, 9):** Far away on the top left.

My immediate goal should be to move centrally and closer to the apple at (8, 4) while steering clear of enemy bodies and walls.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Move Options Evaluation**\n\nAt (3, 7), I will evaluate the four available moves:\n\n#### **Option 1: UP (3, 8)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves back into my own body.\n   - **Invalid Move:** Results in self-collision.\n\n#### **Option 2: DOWN (3, 6)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me downward, keeping me safely central and positioning me closer to the apple (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Keeps me away from walls and opens up future pathways toward (8, 4).\n     - Avoids Snake #0\u2019s current trajectory entirely.\n   - **Cons:**  \n     - Moving down takes me slightly farther from the center of the board, making maneuverability slightly harder long-term if I\u2019m not careful.\n\n#### **Option 3: LEFT (2, 7)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me closer to the body of Snake #0, potentially entering a contested region where Snake #0 might move.\n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Keeps me central and flexible if I decide to pivot toward another target.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Greater risk of confrontation with Snake #0.\n     - The move does not progress me toward (8, 4) and increases risk of hazards from enemy snakes.\n\n#### **Option 4: RIGHT (4, 7)**\n   - **Outcome:** Moves me toward the open space on the right side of the board, allowing me to initiate a path toward (8, 4).\n   - **Pros:**  \n     - Safely positions me away from Snake #0.\n     - Progresses me meaningfully toward the target apple (8, 4).\n     - Maintains good positioning for long-term flexibility.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - No immediate risks, but slight inefficiency in reaching the apple compared to moving downward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Decision**\nAfter evaluating my current position and the board state, the best move here is **RIGHT (4, 7)**:\n1. It creates a safe path toward (8, 4) while avoiding conflict with Snake #0.  \n2. It positions me more centrally, which gives me flexibility to pivot if Snake #0 or other constraints arise.\n3. It avoids collisions with my own body and keeps me away from the walls, ensuring better long-term flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n1. Continue progressing toward the apple at (8, 4) while maintaining a safe position.\n2. Monitor the movement of Snake #0 to ensure its trajectory does not interfere with mine.\n3.

Keep moving rightward until closer to the target's x-coordinate.  \n2. Once aligned with the apple in the x-dimension, begin moving downward to reach (8, 4).  \n3. Monitor Snake #0, though it is currently irrelevant to my path.  \n4. Be mindful that after eating (8, 4), my newly added tail segment might require longer decision sequences to avoid self-collision.\n\n---\n\n**Next Move:** **RIGHT**"
