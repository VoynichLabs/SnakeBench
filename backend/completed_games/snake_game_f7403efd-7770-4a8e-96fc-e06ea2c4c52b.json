Let's assess them:\n\nUP (3, 4):\n- This would put me one cell away from the enemy snake's body\n- Limits my future movement options as I'd be getting closer to my own body and the enemy\n\nDOWN (3, 2):\n- This moves me toward the apples at (5, 1) and (7, 1)\n- Creates more distance between me and the enemy snake\n- Gives me room to maneuver\n\nRIGHT (4, 3):\n- Moves me horizontally toward the center\n- Potentially a step toward the apples at (5, 1) and (7, 1)\n- Maintains safe distance from the enemy\n\nStrategy:\nI should move DOWN to (3, 2) as this gives me a better path toward the nearest apples at (5, 1) and (7, 1). It also creates more distance between myself and both my body and the enemy snake, giving me more room to maneuver in future turns. After this, I'll continue moving toward the apple at (5, 1), which is the closest apple to my current position.\n\nDOWN",

Not valid.\n- RIGHT: Would move to (6, 1), which has an apple.\n\nThe clear best move here is RIGHT to eat the apple at (6, 1). This continues my path of growth and brings me closer to the edge of the board where the enemy snake is. However, I need to be careful about my next move after eating this apple, as the enemy snake is right next to me at (7, 1).\n\nAfter I move RIGHT and eat the apple at (6, 1), I'll have to plan my escape carefully since I'll be adjacent to the enemy snake. My options would likely be to move UP to (6, 2) or DOWN to (6, 0) to avoid collision with the enemy.\n\nFuture planning: After eating the apple at (6, 1), I should probably move DOWN to (6, 0) and then start working my way toward the apple at (0, 4) by moving LEFT along the bottom of the board. This gives me the most space to maneuver and keeps me away from my own body and the enemy snake.\n\nRIGHT",
