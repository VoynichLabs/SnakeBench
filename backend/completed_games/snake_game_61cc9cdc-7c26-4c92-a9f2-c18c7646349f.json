While it's relatively close, it's not in immediate conflict with me at the moment. I should still plan ahead to avoid potential collisions near (6, 3) in later moves.\n\n4. **Strategy Moving Forward**:\n   - The current apple at (6, 3) should remain my top priority since it's the closest. Once I eat it, I'll reassess for the next closest apple.\n   - Steer clear of Snake #0 as it maneuvers towards its own objectives.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\n**UP**"
