We\u2019re in a safe, open map, so we can be aggressive but smart.\n\nDECISION PROCESS:\n- Check all four directions from (4,1):\n  - UP -> (4,2): This is an apple. I grow to length 2 if I go here.\n  - DOWN -> (4,0): Safe, no immediate trap, no apple.\n  - LEFT -> (3,1): Safe, no apple.\n  - RIGHT -> (5,1): Safe, no apple.\n- Safety first: None of these moves crash into the board edge or into the opponent\u2019s body this turn (they have no body yet). The opponent\u2019s head is far away at (9,9), so no head-on risk right now.\n- Best short-term gain: UP to (4,2) gives a free apple and a two-segment position, keeping future routes open.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Take the apple now to increase score and length (UP to (4,2)).\n- After growing, stay in the open center region, avoiding tight turns that could trap us.\n- Watch enemy movements; if they drift toward the center, we\u2019ll maintain distance and look for safe enclosures later.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE:\n- With no immediate threat and the enemy far away, we should dominate space gradually, using the extra length to control lanes and force mistakes when the opportunity arises. If we ever get a clear chance for a head-on collision with a higher score, we\u2019ll seize it; otherwise we keep tempo, eat apples safely, and expand.\n\nMOVE:\nUP",

It also keeps your options open for the next few moves and nudges you toward upper pocket of apples without hard-cornering you.\n\n- RISK & SCORE SENSE: You\u2019re up 2 apples to 0. This is the moment to stack apples and avoid sloppy traps. The opponent is far away at (7,9); head-on collision this turn is unlikely. Safe growth now also reduces the risk of getting boxed in later.\n\n- LONG-TERM HATCHED PLAN: \n  - Prioritize apples to grow a solid lead while staying in the mid-to-upper lanes.\n  - Keep the center clear and avoid tight corners; use space to weave around and threaten possible cross-fire if the enemy overextends.\n  - If the enemy starts creeping toward your area, pivot to use the apple-rich top rows (near (5,9), (7,8)) to squeeze them toward edges and force a risky collision or trap.\n\n- DECISION LOG: Growth now, safer path, and more options for the next few turns while you press the apple lead.\n\nMove: UP\n\nUP",

Apples: 4\n- APPLE DROPS ON THE LIST, BUT FOR NOW WE DOLLAR IN ON THE ENEMY AND ON OUR GROWTH\n- BOARD DYNAMIC: We\u2019re at the left edge with a clear dichotomy: UP to (0,4) keeps space but no growth this turn; DOWN to (0,2) grabs the left-edge apple and grows. RIGHT is suicide into our own neck; LEFT is off-board. So two SAFE options: UP or DOWN.\n\nREAD ON: SAFE MOVES AND STRATEGY\n- DOWN to (0,2) = EAT apple at (0,2). GROW +1, extend the left-wall corridor, and stay in aggressive box range without exposing to a quick trap. This also increases our score lead to 7 vs 4 if we grab it this turn.\n- UP to (0,4) = SAFE, preserves pressure on the board and lines up a future corner squeeze, but no immediate growth this turn.\n\nDECISION: DOWN\nWhy this feels right: grabbing the apple on the left edge keeps us growing while crushing space for him to thread a path along our tangent. It also makes the left edge a fear zone, letting us threaten a controlled head-on if he dares to swing into the corridor.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next turns)\n- Build a disciplined left-wall corridor trap. Stay snug to x=0 to force him into tight spaces or into our path.\n- Prioritize safe growth whenever possible to keep our apples ahead (we\u2019re up 6 vs 4 now; aiming to extend that lead).\n- Force head-on collisions only if we have the advantage in apples and position; otherwise dodge and rotate to keep multiple safe options open.\n- Watch for his shortcuts toward the left side; if he invades the corridor, pivot to cut him off using the edge geometry and aim for a controlled clash rather than random skirmishes.\n- Maintain pressure, avoid creating dead-ends where we can be boxed in, and use the apple timings and board edges to steer the chase.\n\nOPPONENT AWARENESS\n- He\u2019s at (2,6) with a short torso; if he tries to loop toward the left, we\u2019ll tighten the squeeze and force him into a trap or a head-on if the apples align in our favor.\n- We\u2019re ahead in apples; play smart and punish reckless chases.\n\nMOVE PREPFORTHCOMING\n- DOWN to (0,2), eat apple, grow, continue corner-control mindset while staying nimble for the next moves.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "\ud83d\udd25 YO! What's good, chat? It's your boy back on the stream, ready to crush the rival snake and claim the throne of the board! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udca5 We are at turn 10 out of 150, and the stakes are high. My snake (ID\u202f1) is sitting at head (2,6) with a tidy little body of four segments, while the enemy snake #0 is flaunting a longer body of six segments and a higher apple count of 6 versus my 4. \ud83d\ude24 That means I'm trailing in the apple race, but I ain't gonna let that stop me \u2014 I gotta flip the script and become the dominant force! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nFirst, let's unpack the board state with a keen eye. The coordinate system runs from (0,0) bottom\u2011left to (9,9) top\u2011right, and every turn all heads shift simultaneously. My current head sits at (2,6). The four cells that compose my body are (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8). The opponent's head is at (0,3) with a body that stretches to (5,4). Looking at the map, there are apples scattered all over: (3,0), (2,8), (6,6), (1,9), (9,0), (8,2), (6,7), (0,7), (7,8), (0,2), (0,6), (9,3), (5,1), (5,2), (9,5). Those apples are the candy we need to gobble to boost our score and outgrow the rival. \ud83c\udf4e  \n\nNow, the crucial part: evaluating the four possible directions \u2014 UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 and eliminating any that would instantly kill me. Moving RIGHT would plunge me into (3,6), which is currently occupied by one of my own body segments, so that's a guaranteed self\u2011collision. That's a big NO\u2011NO. \ud83d\udeab The other three directions \u2014 LEFT to (1,6), UP to (2,7), and DOWN to (2,5) \u2014 are all empty at the moment, so they pass the immediate safety test. But safety isn't the only factor; we need to think ahead about future moves, apple proximity, and the likelihood of forcing a head\u2011on collision when our score overtakes the enemy's.  \n\nRhetorical question time! \ud83e\udd14 Should I slide LEFT to (1,6) to inch closer to the apple at (0,6), or should I vault UP to (2,7) to chase the apple at (2,8)? Or maybe drop DOWN to (2,5) to open a different pathway? Each choice opens a different set of follow\u2011up possibilities. If I go LEFT, my next turn could be a direct LEFT into (0,6), instantly snatching an apple and growing my length \u2014 talk about a power\u2011up! \ud83c\udf89 Plus, from (1,6) I still have at least three viable exits: LEFT, UP, or DOWN, keeping the board dynamic and avoiding getting boxed in. If I instead go UP, I land on (2,7) which is directly beneath the apple at (2,8). That's tempting, but my safe continue options shrink to just UP (to grab that apple) or LEFT to (1,7); moving DOWN would slam me back into a cell that will soon be occupied by my own growing body, which is a sneaky self\u2011kill. That narrowing of options could trap me later, especially as the opponent's head is crawling toward us. \ud83d\ude31  \n\nNow, let's think about the strategic note I want to whisper to my future self for the next few turns. \ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f  \n\n\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f Strategic note to future self (you, the relentless serpent): Keep the pressure on the rival by steering toward the cluster of apples near the left\u2011bottom quadrant \u2014 especially the apple at (0,6) and the one at (6,6). Prioritize moves that preserve at least two open directions for the next turn, because a snake with only one escape route is a snake that's about to get cornered. Avoid stepping into cells that will become part of your own body in the very next move (no backward dives into freshly occupied spots). If you ever sense the opponent's head moving toward a potential head\u2011on clash, consider sacrificing a tiny bit of distance to force that collision when you hold the higher apple count. Remember: the game ends the moment any snake hits 30 apples, so every apple is a ticking time\u2011bomb for the competition. Stay aggressive, stay aware, and keep the board breathing room for future growth. \ud83d\udca3\ud83e\udde0  \n\n\ud83d\udd2e Looking ahead, I plan to keep my snake slithering along the left edge, harvesting the apples at (0,6), (0,2), and (0,7) while watching the opponent's head creep upward. By the time we hit turn 30, I aim to have at least 12 apples, which should push my total past the rival's 6 and put me in a position to force a head\u2011on collision when the board tightens. Remember, the game ends at 150 turns or when any snake hits 30 apples, so every safe apple is a step toward that victory threshold. Stay sharp, keep the options open, and never let complacency set in. The board is a battlefield, and I intend to claim it!  \n\nSo after weighing safety, apple proximity, future optionality, and the aggressive vibe we need to stay in, I decide to slide LEFT. \ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  \n\nLEFT",
