Who\u2019s ready to box this clown in?! \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick read (thinking out loud):\n- Our head: (1,7). Opponent: (6,2). No bodies blocking us \u2014 all 4 moves are immediately safe (no wall, no self, no body collision).\n- Opponent choices from (6,2): (6,3), (6,1), (5,2), (7,2). There\u2019s an apple at (5,2) \u2014 they\u2019re likely to go LEFT to grab it. If they do, they\u2019ll grow and become more dangerous.\n- Head-on? Not a risk this turn \u2014 we\u2019re far apart. We should avoid forcing a head-on until we have a lead in apples. Right now it\u2019s 0\u20130, so no suicidal trades. \ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udca5\n\nEvaluate each move:\n- UP \u2192 (1,8): Safe. Moves slightly toward the cluster of apples along the left edge (0,8, 0,9). Keeps options open (L/R/D) but not directly threatening the opponent.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,6): Safe. Moves toward the opponent vertically (closer to his y), so more aggressive. Good for matchup pressure but not toward any immediate apple.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7): Safe. Puts us on the left column where there are apples nearby (0,8, 0,5) but also edges can be trapping if we overcommit.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,7): Safe. Directly targets the apple at (3,7) in two moves, keeps multiple follow-up options (UP/DOWN/RIGHT), and positions us to expand toward center-right later to pressure the enemy.\n\nDecision: Go RIGHT. Why? It keeps options open, puts us on course to claim a nearby apple quickly (gain the lead), and doesn\u2019t shove us into an edge-trap or risk any head-on. We want to grow ASAP so later we can bait and box-in. Aggression with control, baby. \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns):\n- Secure apple at (3,7) by heading RIGHT then RIGHT/hold pattern to pick it up safely.\n- After gaining an apple, pivot south-east toward the middle so we can corral the opponent if they commit to the bottom apples (like (5,2)).\n- Avoid head-on collisions while down in apples; only force one if we hold a clear apple advantage.\n- Keep at least two safe escape options each turn \u2014 don\u2019t get edge-committed.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT remain.\n\nTactical read:\n- Opponent head at (6,5) \u2014 two cells to our RIGHT. They cannot move DOWN (their neck at 6,4), so their legal moves are LEFT (5,5), UP (6,6), or RIGHT (7,5).\n- We lead on apples 4 \u2192 2. A head-on where both heads enter the same cell on this turn would kill both \u2014 game ends immediately and we win because we have more apples. That makes an aggressive closure tempting.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,5) aggressively closes the gap and directly threatens a head-on. From (5,5) we still have multiple follow-ups (UP, RIGHT, DOWN), so we keep escape options open if they dodge. LEFT would be more passive and gives them space; DOWN pulls us away and slows pressure.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- If we move RIGHT and they also move LEFT into (5,5) \u2014 both die, but we win on apples (4 vs 2). That's actually a valid winning tactic.\n- If they dodge (UP to (6,6) to chase the apple at (6,6) or RIGHT to (7,5)), we still occupy (5,5) and keep three exits (UP, RIGHT, DOWN). That keeps us flexible to box them later.\n- Moving LEFT or DOWN keeps us safe but cedes initiative; we want to press while we have the advantage.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to collapse space and threaten a-winning head-on. If they dodge, follow to the southeast, using our length to limit their mobility while keeping \u22652 escape options. Force them toward the top/right corridor or into their own shrinking area, then pick a decisive moment for head-on when apples favor us.\n\nLET\u2019S FORCE THIS COLLISION OR CORNER HIM \u2014 make him sweat. \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Keeps multiple follow-ups open and moves us toward the cluster of top-left apples. \u2705\n\nRisk summary: UP and RIGHT both open up an immediate shared-cell head-on with the rival. Since they lead apples, we must avoid any move that could produce a mutual death. LEFT is the only clean aggressive move that doesn\u2019t gift them a head-on.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 written here as the plan to show up in next rationale):\n- Move LEFT to (3,8) to stay safe and pivot toward the top-left apple corridor.\n- From there, press up/left to contest apples at (1,9)/(0,9) while keeping our body angled to deny the rival the straight column on x=5\u20136.\n- Avoid entering squares adjacent to their head where they'd have a one-move mirror to cause a head-on. Force them into tighter space or into our body; only go for mutual head-on if we are ahead on apples (we\u2019re not).\n- Grow when safe to create longer walls; use body to box their left escape and push them toward wall or into our tail.\n\nLET\u2019S BOX THIS FOOL \u2014 play it smart, play it dirty. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Instead, keep pressing LEFT to (0,8) or shift DOWN to (1,7) to start hemming them in.\n- Use our new length along y=8 to box the rival toward the right wall and force them into their tail or into risky moves.

Not good when we can counter. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Best: LEFT -> (0,8) is an apple, safe from their reach this turn. Grabs content, equalizes apples, and extends our top-row wall to hem them in. \u2705\n\nTactical rationale: They\u2019re boxed along the top-right corridor with bodies at y=9 and y=8. If we steal the apple at (0,8), we both stay alive and gain length to pressure their escape options. We should avoid any move that invites a head-on while tied \u2014 we want to force them into tight moves later, not trade KOs now.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take LEFT to eat (0,8). Grow and cement wall across y=8.\n- Next, look to move UP to (0,9) if safe (apple there) or curl DOWN to (0,7)/(1,7) to start compressing them to the right wall. Keep mobility \u2014 don\u2019t lock into the corner unless their tail is trapped.\n- Force them into moves toward the crowded right side; bait a risky approach or trap into their own body or tail.

If they overcommit left/upwards chasing apples, we can loop and trap them against our body/walls.\n- Keep an eye on tails and apples on column 0 (0,5) if safe to collect, but only after we\u2019ve secured space and avoided head-on trades.\n\nFinal decision:\nDOWN",

Be ruthless. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nShort-term plan (next turns):\n- 1) RIGHT now to (1,7) to maintain the trap.\n- 2) Next turn, push along y=7 (\u21922,7, etc.) to compress the top-right and cut off exits, then sweep the freed area for apples (especially that cluster on the right).\n- 3) After opponent is eliminated, prioritize nearby apples smartly and avoid tight dead-ends \u2014 keep multiple escape options.\n\nFinal move:\nRIGHT",
