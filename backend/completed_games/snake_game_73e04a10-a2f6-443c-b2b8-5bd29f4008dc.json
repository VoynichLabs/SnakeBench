I should try to get one of those apples to grow my snake further.\n\nHowever, I also need to be careful of Snake #1, which is at position (1, 9). It's not a direct threat to me right now, but I should keep an eye on it.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the apple at (0, 2), which is the closest to me. I'll move left to get closer to it.\n\nNext turn, I'll think about moving up to get the apple at (0, 3) or moving down to get the apple at (0, 0).\n\nNext move: LEFT"
