Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 10) off board \u2192 death, so enemy won\u2019t choose that if rational.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 8) safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 9) safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 9) safe.  \n\nNo immediate overlap possible with my moves because I\u2019m at (0, 6) far away.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nClosest apples to me:  \n- (1, 3) is 3 steps away in Manhattan distance (dx=1, dy=3).  \n- (3, 3) is 6 steps away.  \n- (6, 7) is 6 steps away.  \n- (5, 9) is far.  \n- (8, 2) is far.  \n\nFrom (0, 6):  \n- UP to (0, 7): moves away from (1, 3) in y, but keeps x same.  \n- DOWN to (0, 5): moves closer to (1, 3) in y (now dy=2).  \n- RIGHT to (1, 6): moves closer in x to (1, 3) but same y distance.  \n\nManhattan distance after each move:  \nUP: to (1, 3) = |1-0| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5  \nDOWN: to (1, 3) = |1-0| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3  \nRIGHT: to (1, 3) = |1-1| + |3-6| = 0 + 3 = 3  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both reduce distance equally (3).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility:**  \n\nFrom (0, 7): possible moves next turn: UP (0,8), DOWN (0,6), RIGHT (1,7) \u2013 3 options.  \nFrom (0, 5): possible moves next turn: UP (0,6), DOWN (0,4), RIGHT (1,5) \u2013 3 options.  \nFrom (1, 6): possible moves next turn: UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6) \u2013 4 options.  \n\nRIGHT gives more future options (4 vs 3).  \n\nAlso, moving RIGHT gets me off the left wall, opening more space.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of trapping later:**  \n\nAt length 1, no body to worry about. But staying near wall reduces options. RIGHT seems best for opening space and equal apple distance improvement.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (1, 6), aim toward (1, 3) by going DOWN in future turns, but check enemy movement. Enemy is far away for now, so focus on growth.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN eats it immediately.  \nOther apples: (3,3), (8,2), (6,7), (8,9).  \nEating an apple now grows me to length 2 (head + tail), giving me a body to protect against head-on collisions next turn.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after eating apple:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (1,3) and eat apple:  \n- My new head at (1,3), my tail stays at (1,4) (since growth adds segment at tail, so body will be [(1,3), (1,4)]).  \nNext turn from (1,3):  \n  - UP \u2192 (1,4) my own body \u2192 death.  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,2) empty.  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,3) empty.  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,3) empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).

Consider moving toward (3,3) or (8,2) afterward. Enemy has 1 apple already, so I need to catch up.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN eats apple, is safe, and grows me.

I didn\u2019t eat apple, so no growth \u2192 tail moves from (1,4) to (1,3)? Actually:  \nSnake movement: head goes to new cell, each body segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position. So:  \nOld head (1,3) becomes body segment 1, old body (1,4) becomes segment 2.  \nSo new body: [(2,3), (1,3)]? Wait, that\u2019s wrong:  \nOrder: head at (1,3), body at (1,4). Move head to (2,3). Body segment 1 (old head (1,3)) moves to where head was? No \u2014 body segment 1 moves to old head position? Actually:  \nBody list before move: head (1,3), body[0] = (1,4).  \nAfter move: head = (2,3), body[0] = (1,3), body[1] is removed because no apple eaten. So new body = [(1,3)] only. So length stays 2: head (2,3), tail (1,3).  \n\nThus next turn from (2,3):  \n- UP (2,4) empty.  \n- DOWN (2,2) empty.  \n- LEFT (1,3) my own tail \u2192 safe? Wait, tail is at (1,3) now, but after this move, tail will move again next turn if no apple eaten. Actually, if I move LEFT from (2,3) to (1,3) next turn, that\u2019s where my tail currently is, but tail will move away before I get there? No \u2014 simultaneous movement:  \nAt start of next turn, my body is [(2,3), (1,3)]. If I choose LEFT, head goes to (1,3) which is currently occupied by my tail. But tail moves only after head moves? In Snake, all segments shift after head moves: tail moves forward one cell along body path. So at the moment head moves into (1,3), tail is still at (1,3) for that instant \u2192 collision with own body \u2192 death. So LEFT next turn would be deadly.  \n\nThus from (2,3), safe next moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nFrom (0,3) next turn: similar logic, need to check.  \nFrom (1,2) next turn: safe moves likely 3.  \n\nBut RIGHT gives best apple proximity.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid trapping myself**  \nRIGHT seems fine: moves toward apple (3,3), keeps options open (3 safe moves next turn).  \nLEFT to (0,3) is safe but moves away from apples and toward left edge.  \nDOWN to (1,2) safe but away from apples.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy potential**  \nEnemy might go DOWN to (6,7) to eat apple there. That\u2019s far from me. No conflict.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT moves toward nearest apple, is safe now, and keeps future mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,3), avoid moving LEFT into (1,3) (own tail).

Actually growth: tail stays where it was, new segment added after movement? Standard Snake: after eating, head moves to apple cell, body shifts, tail does not move, so length increases by 1. So new body = [(2,3), (1,3)] (length 3 total).  \nFrom (2,4) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2,5) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,3) my body \u2192 death. \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,4) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,4) empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf I eat apple at (3,3) (RIGHT):  \nNew head (3,3), body = [(2,3), (1,3)].  \nFrom (3,3) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (3,4) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,2) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,3) my body \u2192 death. \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,3) empty.  \nAlso 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nDOWN to (2,2) (no apple):  \nNew head (2,2), body = [(2,3)] (tail gone).  \nFrom (2,2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2,3) my body \u2192 death?

Wait, scores say Snake #1 apples: 5, same as before. Possibly no apple eaten last turn? Let\u2019s check: last turn enemy head at (5,8), apple at (5,9) was on board. If enemy moved UP to (5,9), it would eat apple and grow to length 6. But board shows at row 9: \". . . . . 1 . . . .\" \u2014 so enemy head is at (5,9) now, meaning it did move UP and ate apple. Scores not updated yet? Possibly scores shown are before last turn\u2019s apple consumption. So enemy length now 6, body: new head (5,9), old body [(5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)] plus new tail segment? Actually after eating, tail stays same length until next move? In Snake, after eating, you grow by 1 at the end of the turn, so next turn body length increases. So enemy length now 6, but body coordinates still length 5 until after this move?

UP risks collision if enemy chooses DOWN.  \nLEFT moves toward apple (5,6) and keeps good mobility.  \nRIGHT moves away from most apples but is safe.  \nBest: LEFT to (5,5) \u2192 next turn I can go UP to (5,6) for apple if still there, or move elsewhere.  \nEnemy at (6,7) is close but not intersecting my path if I go LEFT.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,5), check if (5,6) is still an apple. If yes, consider UP to eat it, but first check if enemy could reach (5,6) or (6,6) and threaten head-on.

So LEFT to apple (2,4) is safe from enemy head collision this turn.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple is (2,4) at LEFT from my head.

Eating it would grow me to length 9.  \nOther apples: (0,6) is up-left, (0,8) and (0,9) are far top-left, (5,6) is far right.  \nLEFT directly eats apple (0,4).  \nUP moves toward (0,6) but risks head-on.  \nDOWN moves away from apples.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \n- LEFT to (0,4) (eat apple): after eating, new tail stays where it is, so my body will be [(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)] length 9. From (0,4): UP (0,5) empty, DOWN (0,3) empty, LEFT off board \u274c, RIGHT (1,4) my body \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, but I\u2019ll be at left edge.  \n- DOWN to (1,3): from there UP (1,4) my body, DOWN (1,2) empty, LEFT (0,3) empty, RIGHT (2,3) empty \u2192 3 safe moves, but away from apples.  \n- UP to (1,5): risky head-on possible, but if enemy doesn\u2019t go DOWN, then from (1,5): UP (1,6) enemy head? Wait, enemy might move away. Actually, if enemy goes LEFT or UP, (1,6) could be empty next turn. But still risky.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Strategic choice**  \nEating apple at (0,4) is safe (no enemy can reach it this turn) and gives me a point lead (8 vs 5).  \nDisadvantage: after eating, I\u2019ll be at left edge with only UP/DOWN options, which could limit escape if enemy approaches.  \nBut enemy is at (1,6) and likely going for (0,6) apple or staying away.  \nIf I eat (0,4), next turn I can go UP to (0,5) or DOWN to (0,3) to stay safe.  \nUP is too risky due to possible head-on.  \nDOWN is safe but wastes chance to eat apple and extend lead.  \n\nBest: LEFT to eat apple (0,4), then plan to move UP/DOWN next turn to avoid being trapped.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (0,4), check enemy\u2019s new head. If enemy moves toward left column, avoid moving into its path. Likely go UP to (0,5) if safe, to stay near other left-side apples. Keep building lead toward 30 apples.\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s a trap \u2014 I\u2019d die. So DOWN is unsafe after all.  \n\nWait \u2014 check DOWN: (1,7) is empty now, but next turn from (1,7):  \nUP (1,8) will be my body after I move head to (1,7)? Let\u2019s simulate:  \nThis turn: head to (1,7), body becomes [(1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (2,7)] \u2014 tail (3,7) gone.  \nNext turn from (1,7):  \nUP (1,8) \u2192 body segment \u2192 invalid  \nDOWN (1,6) \u2192 body segment \u2192 invalid  \nLEFT (0,7) \u2192 body segment \u2192 invalid  \nRIGHT (2,7) \u2192 body segment \u2192 invalid  \nYes \u2014 all moves blocked! So DOWN is suicide next turn.

Check: after moving head to (2,8), body: [(1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (2,7)].  \nSo DOWN (2,7) is body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT (1,8) body invalid, RIGHT (3,8) empty.  \nSo only UP and RIGHT possible next turn \u2014 2 options.  \n\nUP gives 2 options next turn, RIGHT gives 2 options next turn.  \n\nBut UP puts me closer to apple (0,9) \u2014 enemy is far, so I can grab it safely next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,9), go LEFT to (0,9) apple if safe.

Good.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple is (5, 6) at Manhattan distance 3 from (5, 3).  \nFrom (5, 4): distance to (5, 6) = 2.  \nFrom (5, 2): distance to (5, 6) = 4.  \nFrom (6, 3): distance to (5, 6) = 1 + 3 = 4.  \n\nAlso (6, 8) is far, but moving UP now keeps path open toward (5, 6).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk of trapping later**  \nMy body blocks left side (columns 0\u20134, rows 2\u20134). Moving DOWN to (5, 2) reduces options next turn and moves away from apples. UP or RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI have 9 apples, enemy 7. I want to approach (5, 6) or (6, 8) while keeping mobility. UP to (5, 4) gets me closer to (5, 6) and keeps options open. RIGHT to (6, 3) also fine but slightly farther from nearest apple.  \n\nUP seems best for apple proximity and future flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5, 4), consider moving UP toward (5, 5) or RIGHT to (6, 4) to approach (5, 6) or (6, 8). Avoid moving left into body cluster.  \n\nUP",

No, I mean: enemy can't collide with me this turn except if we both choose same cell \u2014 but (4, 6) is not reachable by enemy this turn from (5, 4). So all three moves are safe from immediate collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility:**  \n**DOWN to (3, 5):**  \nNext turn: UP (3, 6) body invalid, DOWN (3, 4) empty, LEFT (2, 5) empty, RIGHT (4, 5) empty \u2192 3 options.  \n\n**LEFT to (2, 6):**  \nNext turn: UP (2, 7) empty, DOWN (2, 5) empty, LEFT (1, 6) empty, RIGHT (3, 6) body invalid \u2192 3 options.  \n\n**RIGHT to (4, 6):**  \nNext turn: UP (4, 7) empty, DOWN (4, 5) empty, LEFT (3, 6) body invalid, RIGHT (5, 6) apple but check enemy proximity: enemy at (5, 4) could go UP (5, 5) then next turn RIGHT into (5, 6) \u2014 but that\u2019s two turns away. Actually enemy could also go RIGHT (6, 4) then UP (6, 5) then LEFT (5, 5) etc. But RIGHT puts me closer to enemy\u2019s possible path toward apple at (5, 6).  \n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple: (5, 6) \u2014 from (3, 6), RIGHT (4, 6) gets closer, then next turn RIGHT to apple.  \nAlso apple at (6, 8) \u2014 need to go RIGHT then UP.  \n\nApple at (0, 9) is far and blocked by my body.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy is longer (9 vs 7), so avoid head-on risk. Moving RIGHT toward (5, 6) might put us competing for same apple \u2014 dangerous if we arrive same turn.  \nFrom (5, 4), enemy\u2019s shortest path to (5, 6) is: UP (5, 5), then UP (5, 6) \u2014 2 turns.  \nIf I go RIGHT (4, 6), then RIGHT (5, 6), I also take 2 turns. So possible head-on collision at (5, 6) on turn after next if we both go for it. That\u2019s risky.  \n\nBetter to avoid that risk since enemy is longer.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \nGo LEFT to (2, 6) to steer clear of enemy, maintain mobility, and approach apple at (0, 9) eventually via left side.  \n\nLEFT",

Safe.  \n- LEFT to (4, 4): enemy can\u2019t reach (4, 4) in one move. Safe.  \n- RIGHT to (6, 4): enemy can\u2019t reach (6, 4) in one move. Safe.  \n\nNo immediate head-on risk.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom (5, 5):  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 6) \u2013 apple \u2705 (but will grow next turn if taken)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 4) \u2013 my body \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 5) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 5) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n\u2192 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) if apple taken, else 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT) if apple not taken? Actually if I go UP to (5, 5) now, next turn from (5, 5) I can go UP to (5, 6) apple, which is safe now but will be occupied by apple; eating apple means I grow, so my tail stays, but I\u2019ll have same body length next turn? Wait, growth happens after move, so after eating apple, my tail doesn\u2019t move, so my body length increases by 1. That means next turn from (5, 6) I\u2019ll have more body behind me, but I can still move to adjacent empty cells if available. Let\u2019s check: after eating (5, 6), my new body will be head at (5, 6), then (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), \u2026 etc. So from (5, 6): UP (5, 7) empty, LEFT (4, 6) empty, RIGHT (6, 6) empty. So 3 moves. Good.  \n\nFrom (4, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 5) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 3) \u2013 my body \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 4) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 4) \u2013 my body \u274c  \n\u2192 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT).  \n\nFrom (6, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 5) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 3) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 4) \u2013 my body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 4) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n\u2192 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple is (5, 6) at Manhattan distance 2 from (5, 4).  \nFrom (5, 5): distance to (5, 6) = 1.  \nFrom (4, 4): distance to (5, 6) = 3.  \nFrom (6, 4): distance to (5, 6) = 3.  \n\nAlso (6, 8) is farther. UP gets me closest to apple.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk of trapping later**  \nMy body blocks left side, so moving LEFT to (4, 4) reduces options next turn. RIGHT to (6, 4) is fine but farther from apple. UP to (5, 5) is directly toward apple and keeps 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Enemy path**  \nEnemy at (3, 6) could go RIGHT to (4, 6) next turn, which is adjacent to (5, 6) apple. If I go UP now to (5, 5), next turn I can take (5, 6) before enemy possibly reaches it (enemy would need two moves: (3, 6) \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 (5, 6) or (3, 6) \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 (4, 7) etc). Actually if enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 6) this turn, then from (4, 6) next turn they could go RIGHT to (5, 6) same time I go UP from (5, 5) to (5, 6) \u2192 head-on collision! That\u2019s a risk.  \n\nLet\u2019s check:  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT this turn to (4, 6), then next turn enemy head at (4, 6).  \nIf I\u2019m at (5, 5) and go UP to (5, 6) next turn, enemy could go RIGHT to (5, 6) same turn \u2192 collision.  \n\nSo maybe I should avoid racing directly to (5, 6) if enemy can contest. But enemy has other options too (DOWN, LEFT). They might not go RIGHT. Still, to be safe, maybe go RIGHT to (6, 4) this turn, then approach (6, 8) or (5, 6) from right side.  \n\nBut (6, 4) to (5, 6) distance 3, enemy at (3, 6) to (5, 6) distance 2, so they\u2019re closer. They might get it first anyway.  \n\nActually, if I go UP to (5, 5), next turn I could go LEFT to (4, 5) or RIGHT to (6, 5) instead of UP to (5, 6) if enemy is adjacent. I can decide next turn based on enemy position.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gives best apple proximity and keeps options. If enemy moves to (4, 6), I\u2019ll see it next turn and avoid going to (5, 6) if risky.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5, 5), check enemy head position. If enemy at (4, 6), avoid (5, 6) to prevent head-on; go LEFT or RIGHT instead. If enemy not adjacent to (5, 6), take apple. Keep moving toward open area near top right apples (6, 8), (8, 7).  \n\nUP",

After eating, next turn from (9, 5) I can go UP to (9, 6) toward (9, 9) apple, or DOWN to (9, 4) to move away from edge.  \nEnemy is far and not threatening immediate collision.  \n\nBest choice: RIGHT to eat apple, then next turn move UP or DOWN to regain mobility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 5) after eating apple, avoid RIGHT (off board) and LEFT (into new body). Choose UP toward (9, 9) if safe, else DOWN to open space.  \n\nRIGHT",

Possible enemy moves from (8, 4): UP (8, 5) \u2014 enemy body there, DOWN (8, 3) empty, LEFT (7, 4) empty, RIGHT (9, 4) enemy body. So enemy can move DOWN or LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (7, 4), it's still far from my possible positions. If enemy moves DOWN to (8, 3), also safe. No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple: (6, 0) \u2014 2 moves away (DOWN then LEFT next turn).  \nOther apples: (7, 9) far, (9, 9) far, (0, 9) far, (0, 7) far.  \n\n**Risk assessment:**  \n- DOWN: (7, 0) \u2192 next turn: UP (7, 1) body invalid, DOWN off board invalid, LEFT (6, 0) apple, RIGHT (8, 0) empty \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, but eating apple at (6, 0) would be possible.  \n- RIGHT: (8, 1) \u2192 next turn: UP (8, 2) empty, DOWN (8, 0) empty, LEFT (7, 1) body invalid, RIGHT (9, 1) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- UP: (7, 2) \u2192 next turn: UP (7, 3) empty, DOWN (7, 1) body invalid, LEFT (6, 2) empty, RIGHT (8, 2) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Long-term:**  \nEnemy has 13 apples vs my 7. Enemy is long and controls top-right area. I need to catch up safely.  \nGoing DOWN now gets me closer to (6, 0) but reduces mobility next turn.  \nGoing RIGHT keeps mobility high and allows approaching (6, 0) from the right side next turn (from (8, 0) or (8, 1)).  \nUP moves away from closest apple but keeps options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove RIGHT to maintain mobility, then next turn consider going DOWN to (8, 0) or (8, 1) to approach apple (6, 0) safely without trapping myself.

LEFT to (5,3) also okay but slightly farther from top apples.  \n\nUP gives better path toward (7,9) and keeps more board space open.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP keeps mobility high, progresses toward top apples, avoids enemy (who will be at (6,0) growing).  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (6,4), consider moving toward (7,9) via (6,5)-(6,6)-etc or go left toward (0,9) if enemy blocks right side. Monitor enemy\u2019s new head position after growth.  \n\nUP",

Top row has many apples now. Enemy is trapped at bottom left for now, but could eventually escape left then up. My body blocks the right side heavily, so moving toward left side of board is safer for future pathing.  \nUP to (5,5) keeps me central and progresses toward (4,9) while keeping 3 options next turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gives best apple proximity, good mobility, and continues progress toward top apples without boxing myself in.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (5,5), aim for (4,9) via (4,5)-(4,6)-etc, or go left toward (0,9) if path is clear.

I can reach (4,9) in 2 moves if I go LEFT now then UP next turn. Enemy would need 6 moves minimum, so I can definitely get there first.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI have a 5-apple lead. Securing (4,9) gets me to 14 apples, enemy still at 8. After that, I can aim for (7,9) or (0,7). My body blocks the right side, so moving left opens space.  \nGoing LEFT now to (4,8) is better than UP to (5,9) because from (4,8) I have 3 safe moves next turn, while from (5,9) only 2. Also, if I go UP now, enemy might move up and block (4,9) path? No, enemy is too far. But LEFT gives flexibility to go UP for apple or DOWN/LEFT to avoid any risk.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision**  \nEnemy could go UP to (4,4), then (4,5), etc. No collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Decision:** LEFT gives best future mobility and shortest safe path to apple (4,9).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (4,8), go UP to (4,9) to eat apple, unless enemy somehow threatens immediate collision (unlikely). After eating, consider moving toward (7,9) or (0,7) depending on enemy position. Keep escape routes open.  \n\nLEFT",

UP is safe and gets apple.  \n\n**Decision:** UP to eat apple immediately, then assess next turn.  \n\nUP",

Priority is survival and maintaining options.  \nFrom (3,8), I can go DOWN to (3,7) or LEFT to (2,8) next turn, keeping flexibility.  \nApple (0,9) is reachable in 3 moves if I go LEFT now, but that puts me on (2,9) with only DOWN or LEFT next turn \u2014 could get stuck near corner.  \nBetter to move DOWN now to open more of the board, then loop toward (0,7) or (0,9) later.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter DOWN to (3,8), likely go LEFT to (2,8) next to approach (0,7) or (0,9) while keeping body as barrier on right side. Avoid trapping myself in top-left corner. Let enemy have (3,4) apple \u2014 I don\u2019t need to contest it.  \n\n**Decision:** DOWN to maintain central mobility and avoid top-edge dead end.  \n\nDOWN",

Tail is at (5,6), far \u2014 won\u2019t move out in 1 turn. So LEFT is suicide next turn.  \n\n- RIGHT to (2, 9):  \n  From (2, 9):  \n    UP \u2192 off board \u274c  \n    DOWN \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 my body \u274c (my body at (2,8)? Wait, check my body list: (1,8) yes, (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6). (2,8) is NOT in my body. So DOWN is safe \u2705)  \n    LEFT \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 my body \u274c (will be my body after I move from it)  \n    RIGHT \u2192 (3, 9) \u2192 my body \u274c (3,9 is in my body list)  \n  So from (2, 9), only DOWN is safe. That\u2019s risky but not immediate suicide.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Check if tail moves**  \nMy tail is at (5,6). Next turn after I move, tail stays at (5,6) unless I eat apple. If I eat apple (LEFT), tail stays at (5,6) (I grow, tail doesn\u2019t move). So (0,8) remains occupied.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT (no apple), tail moves to (1,8) next turn? Wait: body list order: head moves to (2,9), then each segment shifts: old head (1,9) becomes new body[0], (1,8) becomes body[1], etc., last body cell (5,6) is removed (tail moves to (5,7)? Let\u2019s check: current body length 15, after moving without apple, length stays 15, so tail moves forward: last body cell (5,6) is dropped, new tail becomes (5,7)? Actually shift: new body = [(1,9), (1,8), (0,8), ... up to (5,7)] \u2014 yes, (5,7) becomes tail. So (0,8) stays occupied, (1,8) stays occupied.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Compare options**  \nLEFT \u2192 eat apple but trapped at (0,9) with no escape next turn \u2192 certain death.  \nRIGHT \u2192 to (2,9), then only DOWN to (2,8) next turn. From (2,8) check next:  \nFrom (2,8):  \nUP \u2192 (2,9) will be body \u274c  \nDOWN \u2192 (2,7) body \u274c  \nLEFT \u2192 (1,8) body \u274c  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3,8) body \u274c  \nSo from (2,8) all moves blocked too \u2014 dead end in 2 turns.  \n\nHmm \u2014 both safe moves now lead to dead ends soon.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Is there a way to survive longer?**  \nMaybe I missed a safe move: from (1,9), DOWN is body (1,8) \u2014 yes blocked. UP off board. So only LEFT and RIGHT.  \n\nLEFT: death next turn.  \nRIGHT: death in 2 turns unless tail movement opens a path.  \n\nTail movement: after RIGHT, tail moves from (5,6) to (5,7). That doesn\u2019t help (0,8) or (1,8) or (2,7) etc.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check if from (2,9) DOWN to (2,8) is safe: (2,8) is free now. Then from (2,8) next turn, maybe (2,7) is still body, (1,8) body, (3,8) body, (2,9) body \u2014 all blocked. So indeed dead end.  \n\nSo both immediate safe moves lead to quick death.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Could I have missed a safe move?**  \nRe-check from (1,9):  \nUP off board \u274c  \nDOWN (1,8) my body \u274c  \nLEFT (0,9) apple \u2705 (safe this turn)  \nRIGHT (2,9) empty \u2705  \n\nYes only those two.  \n\nSo I must pick one that gives a chance later. Maybe enemy dies before me?  \n\nEnemy at (1,5) can go LEFT to (0,5) or RIGHT to (2,5). It might go for apple (5,1) or (0,1) eventually.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT, I live 2 more turns. If I go LEFT, I live 1 more turn but get 1 more apple (16 total).  \n\nGiven I have 15 apples, enemy has 9, if we both die soon, I win. But if I die earlier, enemy could survive longer and win.  \n\nBetter to survive longer, so RIGHT gives me 2 turns, maybe enemy makes mistake or I find escape.  \n\nFrom (2,9) DOWN to (2,8), then maybe (2,7) becomes free if tail moves? Tail at (5,7) then next turn tail moves to (5,8) \u2014 still far. (2,7) is in my body and won\u2019t be free next turn. So dead end.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s simulate:  \nTurn now: me at (1,9), body up to (5,6).  \nMove RIGHT to (2,9), new body: (1,9),(1,8),(0,8),...,(5,7) tail.  \nTurn next: me at (2,9), move DOWN to (2,8), new body: (2,9),(1,9),(1,8),...,(5,8) tail.  \nFrom (2,8): neighbors: (2,9) body, (2,7) body, (1,8) body, (3,8) body \u2192 all blocked.  \n\nSo indeed 2 turns then death.  \n\nLEFT:  \nTurn now: me at (1,9), move LEFT to (0,9) eat apple, grow to length 16, new body: (0,9),(1,9),(1,8),...,(5,6) tail (tail stays).  \nTurn next: from (0,9), all adjacent: (0,10) off, (0,8) body, (-1,9) off, (1,9) body \u2192 all blocked \u2192 death.  \n\nSo both fatal.  \n\nBut maybe rule: if you eat apple, collision with your own new body at (1,9) is checked after eating? Yes, so at (0,9) next turn, (1,9) is my body, so can\u2019t go there.  \n\nSo I must pick RIGHT to live 1 more turn than LEFT.  \n\n**Step 10 \u2013 Long-term note**  \nI\u2019m in a bad spot due to previous path. Right now, only RIGHT avoids instant death next turn. From there, hope enemy dies or some fluke escape appears.  \n\nPlan: Go RIGHT now, next turn DOWN, then see if any cell freed by tail (unlikely). Maybe enemy collides?  \n\nRIGHT",

Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on collision? Enemy head at (2, 9) moves: UP (off board), DOWN (2, 8), LEFT (1, 9), RIGHT (3, 9). None are (2, 4).  \n   \u2192 **Valid**.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 5)  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? Yes \u2014 (1, 5) is my first body segment \u2192 **invalid**.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 5)  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on collision? Enemy can\u2019t reach (3, 5) in one move.  \n   \u2192 **Valid**.\n\nSo valid moves: **DOWN, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n**Risk analysis:**  \nEnemy head at (2, 9) is far away. No immediate head-on collision risk for either move.\n\n**Apple distances from (2, 5):**  \n- (0, 9): dist 10  \n- (7, 9): dist 9  \n- (9, 9): dist 11  \n- (5, 1): dist 5  \n- (0, 1): dist 6  \n\nClosest apple: (5, 1) dist 5.\n\nFrom (2, 5):  \n- DOWN (2, 4) \u2192 dist to (5, 1) = 6  \n- RIGHT (3, 5) \u2192 dist to (5, 1) = 4  \n\nRIGHT is much better for reaching the closest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility:**  \nFrom (3, 5): next moves: UP (3, 6) \u2014 safe?

So 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nRIGHT gives better mobility next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy is far away in top rows, busy with top apples. RIGHT keeps me away from enemy territory and closer to apple (5, 1).\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nGo RIGHT to secure apple (5, 1), then possibly move towards bottom-right area to avoid enemy.

(empty). Enemy snake #1 is at (2,5), far away. No other snake.  \nBut must check simultaneous movement: could enemy move into (2,8) this turn?  \nEnemy head at (2,5):  \n- UP \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 my body \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 its body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN or RIGHT. It cannot reach (2,8) in one move.  \nThus DOWN is safe from immediate collision.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Next turn mobility from (2,8)**  \nIf I go DOWN to (2,8), my new body will be:  \nHead (2,8), then (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8) \u2014 tail at (5,7) is dropped.  \n\nFrom (2,8) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 my body \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 my body \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,8) \u2192 my body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) \u2192 my body \u274c  \n\nAll blocked \u2014 so I\u2019d be trapped and die next turn unless tail movement frees something.  \nTail will move from (5,7) to (5,8) after this turn, so (5,7) becomes free but irrelevant to (2,8)\u2019s neighbors.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Is there any alternative?**  \nOnly DOWN is safe now, so I must take it.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term outlook**  \nI\u2019m in a spiral trap. My only hope is that enemy dies before I do (enemy length 10, me length 16). If enemy collides into my body or itself, I could win after death if I have more apples.  \nBut enemy is far and has space.  \n\nMaybe from (2,8) next turn, if enemy dies this turn, game ends immediately and I win. But enemy likely won\u2019t die this turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Plan for next turn**  \nFrom (2,8) next turn, all moves blocked \u2014 so I will die unless some cell frees up. The only way a neighbor frees is if my tail passes through it, but tail is far away at (5,8) after this turn, moving to (5,8) next turn? Wait, let\u2019s track tail:  \nCurrent body ends at (5,7). After moving to (2,8), tail becomes (5,8) (since last segment (5,7) is dropped). Next turn, tail moves to (5,8)? Actually, next turn after that, tail moves to (5,8) already? Let\u2019s check:  \nNow: body[14] = (5,7)  \nAfter move DOWN: new body = [(2,8), (2,9), (1,9), ..., (5,8)] \u2014 yes tail is (5,8).  \nNext turn from (2,8), tail moves to (5,8)? No, tail stays at (5,8) if I don\u2019t eat apple. So no change in my local trapped situation.  \n\nSo I\u2019m doomed in 2 turns unless enemy dies first.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final choice**  \nOnly one legal move: DOWN.  \n\nDOWN",

So UP goes into my own body immediately. \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 my body \u274c (body[9] = (2,7))  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 my body \u274c (body[3] = (1,8))  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 my body \u274c (body[10] = (3,8))  \n\nAll four moves go into my own body. That means I\u2019m completely surrounded by myself.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check if any of those body cells will become free after tail moves**  \nCurrent body length = 16.  \nTail is at (5, 8) (last in body list).  \nIf I don\u2019t eat an apple this turn, tail will move forward (i.e., the last segment is dropped), so (5, 8) becomes empty next turn, but that doesn\u2019t help me now because my head\u2019s neighbors are (2,9), (2,7), (1,8), (3,8) \u2014 none of those is (5,8).  \n\nSo all four moves are fatal this turn unless one of those neighbor cells is actually empty now. Let\u2019s verify board state from given grid:  \n\nRow 8 (y=8): \"T T 0 T T T . . . .\"  \nWait, that\u2019s confusing \u2014 board shows \"0\" at (2,8) as my head. Neighbors:  \n(2,9) = T (my body)  \n(2,7) = T (my body)  \n(1,8) = T (my body)  \n(3,8) = T (my body)  \n\nYes, all four are my body.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Is there any escape?**  \nThe only way out is if one of those body cells is actually the tail and will move away this turn. But tail is at (5,8), not adjacent to head. So no \u2014 I\u2019m completely boxed in by my own body.  \n\nThat means no matter what I choose, I die this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check rules for immediate win if enemy dies first**  \nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,5). Could it die this turn?  \nEnemy head at (3,5):  \n- UP \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 empty (.)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 empty (.)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 its body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 empty (.)  \n\nSo enemy has 3 safe moves. It could run into me? My body at (2,5) is its body segment, not mine. Actually, board shows (2,5) as T (my body? Wait, T means tail? No, T means snake body segment \u2014 could be mine or enemy\u2019s? In legend: 0 = my head, 1 = enemy head, T = snake body (any snake). So (2,5) is T \u2014 that\u2019s enemy\u2019s body (since enemy\u2019s body includes (2,5)). So enemy won\u2019t hit me.  \n\nEnemy could hit itself if it goes LEFT into (2,5). That\u2019s its own body, so that would kill it. But enemy likely won\u2019t choose that.  \n\nSo enemy likely survives.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Implications**  \nSince I have no safe move, I will die no matter what. But I must still pick a direction. If all moves kill me, maybe I pick one that might kill enemy if they coincidentally move into my head\u2019s destination? But enemy is too far.  \n\nActually, if enemy\u2019s head moves into my head\u2019s cell this turn, we both die (head-on collision). But enemy is at (3,5), can\u2019t reach (2,8) in one move. So no.  \n\nSo I\u2019m dead this turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Final choice**  \nSince all moves are equally fatal, I\u2019ll pick DOWN arbitrarily.  \n\nDOWN",

Yes.  \n   - My body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? Check: (3, 7) is enemy body, but (3, 6) is safe.  \n   - Head-on collision risk? Enemy head at (2, 8) can move UP (2, 9) enemy body \u2014 invalid for enemy, DOWN (2, 7) enemy body \u2014 invalid, LEFT (1, 8) enemy body \u2014 invalid, RIGHT (3, 8) enemy body \u2014 invalid. Wait \u2014 enemy can't move anywhere without hitting its own body except... Actually check:  \n     - UP (2, 9): body segment (2, 9) \u2014 invalid.  \n     - DOWN (2, 7): body segment (2, 7) \u2014 invalid.  \n     - LEFT (1, 8): body segment (1, 8) \u2014 invalid.  \n     - RIGHT (3, 8): body segment (3, 8) \u2014 invalid.  \n   Enemy has **no valid moves**! So enemy will die this turn. That means I don't need to worry about enemy head-on collision \u2014 enemy will be dead before collision check.  \n   So UP is safe from head-on.  \n   \u2192 **Valid**.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 4)  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - My body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Enemy dead this turn, so no head-on risk.  \n   \u2192 **Valid**.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 5)  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - My body? Yes \u2014 (2, 5) is my first body segment \u2192 **invalid**.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 5)  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - My body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Enemy dead \u2192 no head-on.  \n   \u2192 **Valid**.\n\nValid moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Apple distances from (3, 5):**  \n- (0, 9): dist 11  \n- (7, 9): dist 8  \n- (9, 9): dist 10  \n- (5, 1): dist 6  \n- (0, 1): dist 7  \n\nClosest apple: (5, 1) dist 6.\n\nFrom (3, 5):  \n- UP (3, 6) \u2192 dist to (5, 1) = 7  \n- DOWN (3, 4) \u2192 dist to (5, 1) = 5  \n- RIGHT (4, 5) \u2192 dist to (5, 1) = 4  \n\nRIGHT is best for apple (5, 1).\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after this turn (enemy dead):**  \nFrom (4, 5): moves: UP (4, 6) safe, DOWN (4, 4) safe, LEFT (3, 5) \u2014 body?

Yes, invalid, LEFT (2, 6) safe? Enemy body? (2, 6) is enemy body \u2014 invalid, RIGHT (4, 6) safe \u2192 only 1 safe move.  \n\nSo UP is bad for mobility next turn.

RIGHT gets me closest to apple (5, 1) and keeps good mobility. After that, I can plan a route to collect apples efficiently without trapping myself.\n\nRIGHT",
