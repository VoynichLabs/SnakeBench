The enemy's head is at (0,2), so:\n- Moving **UP** from (1,5) would go to (0,5) \u2014 safe (not enemy, not off board).\n- Moving **DOWN** from (1,5) would go to (2,5) \u2014 this is an apple! But we must check if it's safe.\n  - (2,5) is an apple, but is it safe? The enemy is at (0,2), so no immediate threat.\n  - However, since your snake is just a head, moving into an apple is safe (you grow).\n- Moving **LEFT** from (1,5) would go to (0,5) \u2014 same as UP, safe.\n- Moving **RIGHT** from (1,5) would go to (2,5) \u2014 same as DOWN, apple.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\nThe closest apples are at (6,8), (7,7), (6,2), and (2,5). The immediate apple at (2,5) is reachable in one move (DOWN or RIGHT). However, moving RIGHT to (2,5) is the same as moving DOWN, so let's clarify:\n- Moving **DOWN** to (2,5) is an apple.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (2,5) is the same as moving DOWN (since (1,5) to (2,5) is DOWN).\n\nWait, no: moving RIGHT from (1,5) would go to (2,5), which is an apple. Moving DOWN from (1,5) would go to (2,5), same cell. So both RIGHT and DOWN are the same move (same cell).\n\nBut looking at the board, (2,5) is an apple, so moving to it is safe and gains an apple.\n\n### Enemy Threat:\nThe enemy is at (0,2). If you move to (2,5), no immediate collision. If you move UP to (0,5), no collision. If you move LEFT to (0,5), same as UP.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- Since your snake is just a head, you should aim to grow quickly by eating apples. The closest apple is (2,5), reachable in one move.\n- Avoid moving into tight spaces where future moves might be restricted. Since the enemy is far away, focus on growing.\n- If you move to (2,5), you'll grow to a body segment, which will make future moves safer (less likely to hit yourself).\n\n### Move Decision:\nThe safest and most strategic move is to **DOWN** (or RIGHT, same cell) to eat the apple at (2,5) and grow your snake.\n\n---\n**DOWN**",

It can grow in the next turn, but currently, it poses no immediate threat.\n- No risk of self-collision since the snake is empty.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: From (1, 3) to (0, 3)\n   - Check if (0, 3) is safe:\n     - Not on board (0, 3) is valid).\n     - No snake body or apple at (0, 3) (from board state).\n   - Follow-up options: (0, 2) is enemy head, but no immediate risk.\n   - **Rationale**: Safe, but does not grow snake. Not ideal for immediate growth.\n\n2. **DOWN**: From (1, 3) to (2, 3)\n   - Check if (2, 3) is safe:\n     - Valid board position.\n     - No snake body or apple at (2, 3).\n   - Follow-up options: (2, 4) is safe, but no immediate threat.\n   - **Rationale**: Safe, but no apple nearby.\n\n3. **LEFT**: From (1, 3) to (0, 3)\n   - Same as UP, no immediate growth.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: From (1, 3) to (1, 4)\n   - Check if (1, 4) is safe:\n     - Valid board position.\n     - No snake body or apple at (1, 4).\n   - Follow-up options: (1, 5) is safe, but no immediate threat.\n   - **Rationale**: Safe, but no apple nearby.\n\n### Immediate Apple Target:\nThe closest apple is at (2, 5). To reach it, the snake must grow first. The snake can move **DOWN** to (2, 3) and then **DOWN** again to (3, 3), but that's not efficient. Alternatively, the snake can move **RIGHT** to (1, 4), then **RIGHT** to (1, 5), then **DOWN** to (2, 5). However, this is a 3-turn path.\n\nInstead, the snake can move **DOWN** to (2, 3), then **DOWN** to (3, 3), then **RIGHT** to (3, 4), then **DOWN** to (4, 4), then **DOWN** to (5, 4), then **DOWN** to (6, 4), then **DOWN** to (7, 4), then **DOWN** to (8, 4), then **DOWN** to (9, 4) \u2014 this is not efficient.\n\nThe most efficient way to reach (2, 5) is to move **DOWN** to (2, 3), then **DOWN** to (3, 3), then **RIGHT** to (3, 4), then **DOWN** to (4, 4), then **DOWN** to (5, 4), then **DOWN** to (6, 4), then **DOWN** to (7, 4), then **DOWN** to (8, 4), then **DOWN** to (9, 4) \u2014 still not optimal.\n\nThe best immediate move is to grow the snake by moving **DOWN** to (2, 3), then **DOWN** to (3, 3), but this is not a single move.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\nThe snake can move **DOWN** to (2, 3), then **DOWN** to (3, 3), but this is not a single move. Instead, the snake can move **RIGHT** to (1, 4), then **DOWN** to (2, 4), then **DOWN** to (3, 4), then **DOWN** to (4, 4), then **DOWN** to (5, 4), then **DOWN** to (6, 4), then **DOWN** to (7, 4), then **DOWN** to (8, 4), then **DOWN** to (9, 4) \u2014 still not optimal.\n\n### Optimal Immediate Move:\nThe closest apple is (2, 5). The snake can move **DOWN** to (2, 3), then **DOWN** to (3, 3), but this is not a single move. The snake can move **DOWN** to (2, 3), then **DOWN** to (3, 3), but this is not a single move.\n\nInstead, the snake can move **DOWN** to (2, 3), then **DOWN** to (3, 3), but this is not a single move.\n\n### Best Single Move:\nThe snake can move **DOWN** to (2, 3), which is safe and opens up a path to (2, 5) in the next few turns. However, the snake can also move **RIGHT** to (1, 4), which is safe but does not grow the snake.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\nAfter growing, the snake should aim for apples at (6, 8), (7, 7), and (6, 2). The snake should avoid the enemy's potential future body.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe snake should move **DOWN** to (2, 3) to grow the snake and open up future options.\n\n**DOWN**",
