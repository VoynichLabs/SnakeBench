Avoiding the enemy and the left wall, I'm considering moving DOWN towards another apple at (3, 4) as the snake at (2, 3) might be heading to that apple as well. However, as it is quite far, instead I'll go RIGHT because it takes me towards the right upper corner where two apples, (7, 4) and (2, 9), are less crowded with opponents.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

Moving UP would point me towards an apple at (2, 9) whereas moving DOWN would lead me towards the apples at (3, 4), (4, 0) and (7, 4). However, considering the earlier rationale, the apple at (2, 9) is relatively safer as no other snake appears to be near it whereas going down can lead me towards the possible path of snake #2. \n\nNext move: UP."
