Moving UP onto (1, 8) will land on an apple, which is advantageous.\n- The apple at (1, 8) is directly above the current head, making moving UP the most straightforward and safe choice.\n- Checking the surrounding positions:\n  - DOWN: (1, 7) contains our body, so moving down would cause collision.\n  - LEFT: (0, 8) is empty and safe, but doesn't immediately bring us closer to another apple.\n  - RIGHT: (2, 8) is empty and safe, but also doesn't intersect with an apple.\n\nGiven that the apple at (1, 8) is immediately accessible and moving onto it will cause us to grow and gain points, moving UP is the best action now.\n\nNext turn, I will reassess the board and potential paths to apples to avoid getting stuck or into conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Next move: UP**",

Also, it aligns well with my current positioning for access to the remaining apples without boxing myself into a corner. My immediate movement does not bring me in direct contact with an apple or edge, but it serves as a strategic manoeuvre. This allows for potential movement towards the apple at (7, 6) if I need to adjust based on Snake #1's movement. It puts space horizontally between Snake #1 and me, which is beneficial for reduce immediate collision risk. My growth from eating the apple at (6,1) extends my body, making spatial awareness crucial. With this move, I anticipate further assessing Snake #1's movements for mid-game planning.\n\nI intend to stay flexible for the next turn to ensure I can seize opportunities for apples while maintaining distance from Snake #1. This move does not immediately contribute to points but serves as a strategic setup for future enablement.\n\nNext move: LEFT",
