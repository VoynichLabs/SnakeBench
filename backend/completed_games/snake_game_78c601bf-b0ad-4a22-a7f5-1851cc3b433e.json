But there is an apple at (0,3) nearby.\n\nNow, possible moves from (7,3):\n- UP: to (7,4) \u2014 empty. \u2705\n- DOWN: to (7,2) \u2014 empty. \u2705\n- LEFT: to (6,3) \u2014 empty. \u2705\n- RIGHT: to (8,3) \u2014 but that's my own body segment (tail) at (8,3) \u2192 deadly. \u274c\n\nSo unsafe move: RIGHT.\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- Closest apple is (6,5): from (7,3), that is 1 left and 2 up.\n- Also (6,8) is further up.\n- (0,3) is far left, but enemy snake #0 is at (1,3) and might be going for it.\n\n**Enemy snake #0:**\n- At (1,3), likely to move LEFT to (0,3) to eat the apple there, or possibly other directions.\n- It is not an immediate threat to me at (7,3).\n\n**Which safe move is best?**\n- UP (7,4): moves toward (6,5) and (6,8) \u2014 good.\n- DOWN (7,2): moves away from apples \u2014 not ideal.\n- LEFT (6,3): also moves toward (6,5) \u2014 good.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are good. However, from (6,3), I can go UP to (6,4) then UP to (6,5) to get the apple. From (7,4), I can go LEFT to (6,4) then UP to (6,5). So both are equivalent in steps.\n\nBut consider future moves: if I go LEFT to (6,3), next turn I might have more options (UP, DOWN, LEFT) whereas if I go UP to (7,4), next turn I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? Actually, at (7,4), DOWN is back to (7,3) which might be safe if my tail moves? But currently, my tail is at (8,3), and if I move, the tail will shift? Wait, no: since I didn't eat, the tail remains at (8,3) for now. But when I move, the tail will follow? Actually, in Snake, when you don't eat, the tail moves forward. So after my move, my body will update: the head moves to new cell, and the tail segment is removed? Actually, the body list is updated: the new head is appended, and the last segment (tail) is removed if no apple eaten.\n\nSo after this move, if I don't eat:\n- My body will become: [new head, (7,3)] and the tail (8,3) is gone? Actually, the body has only one segment: the previous head (8,3) becomes the tail. After moving without eating, the entire snake moves: head to new position, and the tail is cut off (so length remains same). So my snake has length 2 (head and one body segment). After moving, the new head is at (new pos), and the body becomes [old head]. So the tail (old body) is discarded.\n\nTherefore, after this move:\n- If I go UP to (7,4), my body becomes [(7,4), (7,3)].\n- If I go DOWN to (7,2), body becomes [(7,2), (7,3)].\n- If I go LEFT to (6,3), body becomes [(6,3), (7,3)].\n\nAnd the old tail (8,3) is now empty.\n\nSo next turn, the cell (8,3) will be free.\n\nNow, back to move choice:\n- UP (7,4): safe, and next turn from (7,4), I can go UP to (7,5), DOWN to (7,3) (which is my body? Actually, next turn my body will be at (7,3), so DOWN would be deadly), LEFT to (6,4), or RIGHT to (8,4). So safe moves next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe.\n- LEFT (6,3): safe, and next turn from (6,3), body at (7,3). Moves: UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3). RIGHT to (7,3) is deadly. So safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nBoth have 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nBut LEFT gets me closer to the apple at (6,5) horizontally. Also, from (6,3), I can go UP twice to (6,5). From (7,4), I need to go LEFT and then UP.\n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because it reduces the horizontal distance to the apple.\n\nAlso, if I go LEFT, I avoid the right edge.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nHead towards the apple at (6,5). After that, consider (6,8) or others. Avoid enemy snake #0 which is on the left side.\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT to (6,3) to get closer to (6,5).\n\nLEFT",

This is highly desirable as it increases my score to 4 (tying with enemy #0 at 4 apples) and grows my length to 5.\n- Moving LEFT or DOWN avoids the apple but keeps me safe. However, eating the apple is a priority to catch up in score.\n\n**Risks:**\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe because no other snake is near (enemy is at (2,1)). There is no risk of collision or death.\n- After eating, my head will be at (9,7) and my body will be [(8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)] (since the tail doesn't move when eating). So next turn, from (9,7), I can move DOWN to (9,6) or LEFT to (8,7) (which will be empty). Both are safe.\n\n**Best move:**\n- RIGHT to (9,7) to eat the apple. This is the optimal move to gain an apple and grow.\n\n**Future plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (9,7), my head will be at (9,7). Next turn, I should move DOWN to (9,6) to avoid going back into my body (which will be at (8,7))? Actually, (8,7) is safe because it is not occupied by my body yet (the body segments are: new head at (9,7), then (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)). So (8,7) is the segment behind the head. So moving LEFT to (8,7) would be into my own body and deadly. Therefore, from (9,7) after eating, only DOWN to (9,6) is safe? Also, if I move LEFT to (8,7), that is my body segment \u2014 so it is deadly. So indeed, only DOWN is safe from (9,7) after eating? Wait, check: the head moves to (9,7) and the body follows: the first body segment is the old head at (8,7). So (8,7) is occupied. Therefore, from (9,7), the safe moves are:\n- DOWN: (9,6) \u2014 empty.\n- UP: (9,8) \u2014 but (9,8) is currently empty? However, after moving, my body will be at (8,7) and (8,8), etc. So (9,8) is free. But wait, the board state shows row 8: \"... T T T .\" meaning (6,8), (7,8), (8,8) are my body? Actually, my current body is [(8,8), (7,8), (6,8)]. After moving RIGHT to (9,7) and eating, the new body becomes: [ (8,7), (8,8), (7,8) ]? Actually, no: when you eat, you grow by one, so the tail doesn't move. So the new body is: head at (9,7), then (8,7) (the old head), then (8,8) (second segment), then (7,8) (third), then (6,8) (tail). So (9,8) is empty. So from (9,7), UP to (9,8) is safe. Also DOWN to (9,6) is safe. LEFT to (8,7) is my body \u2014 deadly. RIGHT is off-board \u2014 deadly.\n\nSo next turn from (9,7), safe moves are UP and DOWN.\n\nTherefore, after eating, I will have two options. So no problem.\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT to (9,7) to eat the apple.\n\nRIGHT\n**END RATIONALE**",

This might limit future options.\n- Moving DOWN to (9,6) is safe and progresses toward (9,4). From (9,6), I can continue down to (9,5) and then (9,4) to eat the apple.\n\n**Risks:**\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (2,2) and far away, so no immediate threat.\n- Moving DOWN is safe and opens up future moves: from (9,6), I can go DOWN again to (9,5) (if empty) or LEFT to (8,6) (which should be empty).\n- Moving UP to (9,8) is safe but leaves me with only DOWN as a safe move next turn (since LEFT is (8,8) which is my body, RIGHT is off-board, UP is off-board). So it would trap me temporarily.\n\n**Best move:**\n- DOWN to (9,6) is preferred because it moves toward the apple at (9,4) and maintains flexibility (multiple moves likely available from (9,6)).\n- UP to (9,8) is less desirable because it leads to a dead-end and away from apples.\n\n**Future plan:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (9,6), my head will be at (9,6) and body will be [(9,7), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8)] (tail at (6,8) moves forward? Wait: when not eating, the tail moves. So after moving without eating, the new body is: head at (9,6), then (9,7) (old head), then (8,7), then (8,8), and the tail (6,8) is gone? Actually, the tail moves: the entire body shifts. So the new body will be: [(9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (8,8)] (length 4? But I have 5 segments because I just ate). Correction: I have 5 segments. So after moving without eating, the tail moves: the head moves to (9,6), then the segments follow: the first body segment becomes (9,7) (old head), second becomes (8,7), third becomes (8,8), and the tail (6,8) is dropped. So the new body is [(9,7), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8)]? Wait, my current body is [(8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)]. After moving down, the head goes to (9,6). The body segments become: the old head (9,7) becomes first body segment, then (8,7) becomes second, (8,8) becomes third, and (7,8) becomes the tail (since (6,8) is dropped). So the new body is [(9,7), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8)].\nSo from (9,6), safe moves will be:\n- DOWN: (9,5) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT: (8,6) \u2014 empty.\n- UP: (9,7) \u2014 but (9,7) is my body (first segment) \u2014 deadly.\n- RIGHT: off-board \u2014 deadly.\nSo from (9,6), safe moves are DOWN and LEFT. This is good flexibility.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN now sets me up to continue toward the apple at (9,4) and has two safe options next turn.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN to (9,6).\n\nDOWN\n**END RATIONALE**",

It might be useful for future maneuvering but delays eating.\n\n**Risks:**\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (1,3), far away. There is no immediate threat of collision.\n- Moving DOWN to (9,4) is safe because no other snake can reach (9,4) this turn (enemy is too far). However, I must check for head-on collisions: enemy head is at (1,3), which is moving? But it cannot reach (9,4) in one move. So no risk.\n- After eating, my body will become [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (8,8)] (growing by one, so tail remains). This is safe.\n\n**Best move:**\n- DOWN to (9,4) to eat the apple. This increases my apple count to 5, closing the gap with the enemy (6 vs 5).\n- LEFT to (8,5) is safe but misses the opportunity to eat the apple now. The apple might be taken by someone else later? But enemy is far, so unlikely.

Also, other apples are at (8,1), (0,1), (5,2), (6,3). The closest is (6,3) or (8,1).

(8,1) is closer in Manhattan distance (|9-8| + |4-1| = 1+3=4) vs (6,3) (|9-6| + |4-3| = 3+1=4).

However, moving LEFT to (8,4) might be slightly better because it opens up more options (I can go DOWN to (8,3) or LEFT to (7,4) next, avoiding the right edge which is a dead end).\n\n**Risks:**\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (1,2), far away.

From (8,4), I can easily access the center and left side where apples are located.\n- Moving DOWN to (9,3) keeps me near the edge, which might be restrictive in future turns.\n\n**Future plan:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (8,4), my head will be at (8,4) and body will be [(9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (8,8)].\nFrom there, I can:\n- DOWN to (8,3) to approach (8,1) or (6,3)\n- LEFT to (7,4) to move toward center\n- UP to (8,5) \u2014 but careful: (8,5) is currently empty, but check next turn.\nI should aim for (8,1) first as it is closest, then (6,3).

Moving DOWN to (6,2) is away from that congestion.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,3) is also safe and opens more central options.\n\n**Choice:**\n- Prefer DOWN to (6,2) because it directly moves toward the apple (5,2) and avoids the congested right side. Also, from (6,2), I have UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (but RIGHT to (7,2) is my body? Actually, (7,2) is my body segment \u2014 so next turn from (6,2), safe moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT. That is still good.\n- Alternatively, LEFT to (5,3) is also good, but then next turn from (5,3), DOWN to (5,2) eats the apple, and then I have UP, LEFT, RIGHT (RIGHT to (6,3) is empty now).

So (1,7) is not an apple? Correction: enemy head is at (1,7), but that is not an apple. The apples are as listed.\n- Therefore, (4,6) is the closest apple. Moving UP to (5,4) gets closer to (4,6) (distance reduces from 3 to 2). Moving LEFT to (4,3) also gets closer (distance reduces from 3 to 2? Actually from (5,3) to (4,6) is |5-4|+|3-6|=1+3=4. From (5,4) it is |5-4|+|4-6|=1+2=3. From (4,3) it is |4-4|+|3-6|=0+3=3. So both moves reduce distance equally.\n- However, UP to (5,4) opens more options: from there, I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT to (4,3) is more constrained: from (4,3), I can only go UP or LEFT (since RIGHT would be back to (5,3) which is my body, and DOWN is (4,2) which is empty? Actually (4,2) is empty? Check board: at row 2, column 4 is empty. So from (4,3), moves would be UP to (4,4), LEFT to (3,3), RIGHT to (5,3) (body), DOWN to (4,2) (empty). So actually UP, LEFT, DOWN are safe? But RIGHT is not. So three options.\n- But UP to (5,4) gives even more options: (5,5), (4,4), (6,4) all likely safe next turn.\n- Also, (7,7) is another target. UP moves toward that as well.\n- Avoid moving toward the bottom where apples are fewer (only (6,1) and (8,0)), and my body is already congested there.\n\n**Risks:**\n- Enemy at (1,7) might be competing for (4,6). But I am closer? Distance from (1,7) to (4,6) is |1-4|+|7-6|=3+1=4. I am at distance 4 from (5,3). So we are equally close. But I have two safe moves to reduce distance to 3, while enemy might have moves to reduce as well.\n- Moving UP is more flexible and keeps me central.\n\n**Choice:**\n- UP to (5,4) is better than LEFT because it maintains more options for future moves and directly progresses toward multiple apples.\n- LEFT to (4,3) is also safe, but it moves me to the edge and might limit future choices.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nFrom (5,4), aim to continue toward (4,6) via (4,4) or (5,5). Monitor enemy movement at (1,7) \u2014 it might be heading to (4,6) as well. Avoid head-on collisions; if enemy is approaching, consider alternative paths to (7,7) or (8,6).\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

My body: [(5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)] (length 10).\n- Apples at: (7,7), (4,6), (8,6), (6,1), (8,0)\n- Enemy snake #0: head at (2,7), body [(1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3)] (length 9).\n- I have 9 apples (length 10), enemy has 8 apples (length 9).\n\n**Safe moves from (5,4):**\n- UP: (5,5) \u2014 empty. \u2705\n- DOWN: (5,3) \u2014 my own body (first segment) \u2014 deadly. \u274c\n- LEFT: (4,4) \u2014 empty. \u2705\n- RIGHT: (6,4) \u2014 empty. \u2705\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Apple proximity and strategy:**\n- Closest apples: (4,6) (distance |5-4|+|4-6|=1+2=3) and (8,6) (distance |5-8|+|4-6|=3+2=5). (7,7) is also reachable (distance |5-7|+|4-7|=2+3=5).\n- Moving UP to (5,5) reduces distance to (4,6) to 2 (|5-4|+|5-6|=1+1=2) and to (8,6) to 4 (|5-8|+|5-6|=3+1=4).\n- Moving LEFT to (4,4) reduces distance to (4,6) to 2 (|4-4|+|4-6|=0+2=2) and to (8,6) to 6 (|4-8|+|4-6|=4+2=6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,4) increases distance to (4,6) to 4 (|6-4|+|4-6|=2+2=4) but reduces distance to (8,6) to 4 (|6-8|+|4-6|=2+2=4) and to (7,7) to 4 (|6-7|+|4-7|=1+3=4).\n- Enemy is at (2,7) and likely targeting (4,6) (distance |2-4|+|7-6|=2+1=3). So we are both close. Moving UP or LEFT gets me equally closer to (4,6), but UP keeps me more central and flexible.\n- Avoid RIGHT because it moves away from (4,6) and toward the enemy? Actually enemy is at (2,7), so moving RIGHT to (6,4) is not directly toward enemy, but it doesn't help with the closest apple.\n- Also, (6,1) and (8,0) are below, but my body is congested there (see board state), so avoiding downward moves is wise.\n\n**Risks:**\n- Enemy might move toward (4,6) as well. From (2,7), enemy can go DOWN to (2,6) (body? enemy body has (2,6) so deadly), LEFT to (1,7) (body), RIGHT to (3,7) (empty), UP to (2,8) (empty). So enemy likely goes RIGHT or UP. If enemy goes RIGHT to (3,7), distance to (4,6) becomes |3-4|+|7-6|=1+1=2. So we might both reach (4,6) in 2 moves.\n- To avoid head-on collision, I should not rush directly if enemy is also coming. But since we are both 2 moves away, I can proceed cautiously.\n\n**Flexibility:**\n- UP to (5,5): from there, I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (likely all safe next turn).\n- LEFT to (4,4): from there, I can go UP to (4,5), LEFT to (3,4), or DOWN to (4,3) (but DOWN might be risky due to body below? Actually (4,3) is empty now).\n- UP is better for future options.\n\n**Choice:**\n- UP to (5,5) is the best move: it reduces distance to the closest apple, maintains central position, and keeps multiple options open.\n- Avoid RIGHT as it moves away from primary target.\n- LEFT is also good, but UP is slightly better for flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nFrom (5,5), assess enemy movement. If enemy is moving toward (4,6) (e.g., to (3,7)), consider going LEFT to (4,5) to compete for the apple, but be cautious of head-on collision. Alternatively, if enemy is too close, pivot toward (7,7) or (8,6) via RIGHT moves. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

My body: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1)] (length 10).\n- Apples at: (7,7), (4,6), (8,6), (6,1), (8,0)\n- Enemy snake #0: head at (4,7), body [(3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4)] (length 9).\n- I have 9 apples (length 10), enemy has 8 apples (length 9).\n\n**Safe moves from (5,6):**\n- UP: (5,7) \u2014 empty. \u2705\n- DOWN: (5,5) \u2014 my own body (first segment) \u2014 deadly. \u274c\n- LEFT: (4,6) \u2014 contains an apple, but also check for enemy: enemy head is at (4,7). Moving LEFT would put me at (4,6). Enemy could also move DOWN to (4,6) this turn? If both move there, head-on collision. High risk. \u274c\n- RIGHT: (6,6) \u2014 empty. \u2705\n\nSo immediately safe moves: UP and RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe due to potential head-on collision with enemy.\n\n**Apple proximity and enemy movement:**\n- Apple at (4,6) is adjacent, but enemy is at (4,7) and can move DOWN to (4,6) this turn. Avoid this conflict.\n- Apple at (7,7) is close: |5-7|+|6-7|=2+1=3.\n- Apple at (8,6) is close: |5-8|+|6-6|=3+0=3.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,6) puts me closer to (7,7) and (8,6) (distance to (7,7)= |6-7|+|6-7|=1+1=2; to (8,6)= |6-8|+|6-6|=2+0=2).\n- Moving UP to (5,7) moves me toward (7,7) (distance |5-7|+|7-7|=2+0=2) but away from (8,6) (distance |5-8|+|7-6|=3+1=4). Also, (5,7) is safe.\n\n**Enemy threats:**\n- Enemy at (4,7) can move DOWN to (4,6) (to eat apple), LEFT to (3,7) (body), RIGHT to (5,7) (empty), or UP to (4,8) (empty).\n- If I move UP to (5,7), enemy might move RIGHT to (5,7) as well? That would cause head-on collision. So UP is risky.\n- If I move RIGHT to (6,6), enemy cannot reach that cell this turn (enemy max move is to (5,7), (4,6), (4,8), or (3,7)). So RIGHT is safer.\n\n**Future flexibility:**\n- From (6,6): next moves likely UP, RIGHT, DOWN (all should be safe, avoiding my body).\n- From (5,7): next moves likely UP, LEFT, RIGHT (but LEFT to (4,7) is enemy head? Actually enemy will move away, but still risky if enemy stays).\n\n**Decision:**\n- Avoid LEFT (directly deadly due to body) and DOWN (deadly).\n- Avoid UP due to risk of head-on collision with enemy moving RIGHT to (5,7).\n- RIGHT to (6,6) is safest: no immediate danger, and moves toward apples (7,7) and (8,6).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nFrom (6,6), aim for (7,7) or (8,6). Monitor enemy movement. Avoid getting too close to enemy head. Consider path to avoid body congestion (my body is mostly below and left).\n\nRIGHT\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

This is the proactive move.\n\nThe enemy is at (0,4) and is likely moving toward the apple at (0,0) or the center. It is not an immediate threat to me in the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Plan:**\nLEFT is the best move. It keeps me on the path to collect the high-value apples (6,1) and (6,0), which are critical for maintaining my lead and reaching the 50-apple win condition. DOWN is safe but leads to a less productive area of the board. The enemy is distant, so I should capitalize on my proximity to these apples.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

My body has grown to 14 segments: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6)] plus the new tail segment (since I ate, the tail didn't move last turn, so the body is now 14 long). Actually, the body list provided for this turn is 13 segments (from head to tail) because the tail grows only after the move. But I have 13 apples collected, meaning my length is 14 (head + 13 body segments). The provided body list has 13 elements, so it is correct for the current state (head at (6,0) and body from (6,1) to (5,6)).\n- Apples at: (8,0), (5,9), (3,8), (8,2), (9,5)\n- Enemy snake #0: head at (2,0), body [(1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)] (length 11, since it has 10 apples? Actually, it has 11 apples collected, so length 12. The body list has 11 elements, so head + 11 body = 12 segments).\n- I have 13 apples (length 14), enemy has 11 apples (length 12).\n\n**Safe moves from (6,0):**\n- UP: (6,1) \u2014 my own body (the cell directly behind my head) \u2014 deadly. \u274c\n- DOWN: (6,-1) \u2014 off the board (invalid y-coordinate) \u2014 deadly. \u274c\n- LEFT: (5,0) \u2014 empty. \u2705\n- RIGHT: (7,0) \u2014 empty. \u2705\n\nOnly safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- LEFT (to (5,0)): Moves me away from the right edge. This might be safer long-term as it keeps me more central. There is an apple at (5,9) far away, and one at (3,8). Also, (8,0) is on the right edge.\n- RIGHT (to (7,0)): Moves me towards the apple at (8,0) (two moves away: RIGHT to (7,0), then RIGHT to (8,0)). This is promising for immediate scoring.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,0) and has safe moves? From (2,0):\n- UP: (2,1) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN: (2,-1) \u2014 off board.\n- LEFT: (1,0) \u2014 its own body.\n- RIGHT: (3,0) \u2014 empty.\nSo it can go UP or RIGHT. It might go RIGHT to (3,0) to move towards the center or possibly towards the apple at (3,8)? But that is far. Alternatively, it might go UP to (2,1).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,0), the enemy is too far to interfere with (8,0) next turn. I can then go RIGHT again to (8,0) to eat that apple. That would be efficient.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5,0), I am moving away from the nearby apple at (8,0). There is no immediate apple in the left direction.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is better for scoring.\n\nAlso, consider future moves after (7,0):\n- From (7,0), I can go RIGHT to (8,0) (apple), UP to (7,1), or DOWN (invalid). So two options: RIGHT (apple) or UP.\nAfter eating (8,0), I would be at (8,0) and could go UP to (8,1) or LEFT to (7,0) (but (7,0) would be my body then? Actually, after moving to (7,0), my body will be behind me: head at (7,0), body starts at (6,0), then (6,1), etc. So from (7,0), UP to (7,1) is safe (empty now). So it's workable.\n\nFrom (5,0) (if I go LEFT):\n- I can go UP to (5,1), LEFT to (4,0), or DOWN (invalid). So two options: UP or LEFT.\nThis is also safe, but no immediate apple.\n\nSo RIGHT is more aggressive and scores sooner.\n\n**Risk of head-on collision?**\nThe enemy is at (2,0). It might go RIGHT to (3,0), then (4,0), etc., but it is 4 moves away from (7,0). No risk this turn.\n\n**Plan:**\nGo RIGHT to (7,0) to set up for eating the apple at (8,0) next turn. This continues efficient scoring.\n\n**Long-term note:**\nAfter eating (8,0), consider moving UP to (8,1) to avoid getting trapped on the bottom edge. Then navigate towards other apples (e.g., (8,2) or (9,5)). Also, be aware of the enemy's position; it might be moving upwards.\n\n**Decision:**\nChoose RIGHT to move towards the apple at (8,0).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

My body will extend, so the tail won't move this turn. The new body segment will be added at the tail (which is currently at (6,6)), so my body will be 14 segments long (head + 14 body) after this move.\n\n**Future considerations after eating (8,0):**\nFrom (8,0) next turn, I can go:\n- UP to (8,1) \u2014 likely safe (currently empty).\n- LEFT to (7,0) \u2014 but (7,0) will become my body segment (the new head position is (8,0), and the old head (7,0) becomes the first body segment). So LEFT would be into my own body and deadly.\nSo only UP would be safe from (8,0) after eating. This is a potential trap: I must go UP next turn to avoid dying. However, (8,1) is currently empty and should be safe. Then from (8,1), I can go UP to (8,2) (another apple!), LEFT to (7,1), or RIGHT to (9,1). So there are options.\n\nGoing RIGHT now to eat the apple is low-risk and high-reward. The enemy is at (3,0) and is far away (5 cells horizontally). It cannot reach (8,0) this turn or next.\n\n**Decision:**\nChoose RIGHT to eat the apple at (8,0). This increases my score and maintains my advantage.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

It is a safe move that keeps me near the right edge. From (8,1), I can go UP to (8,2) (apple), LEFT to (7,1), or RIGHT to (9,1).

From (9,0), next turn I can only go UP (to (9,1)) because DOWN is off, LEFT is into my body (since (8,0) becomes body), and RIGHT is off. So it would force me into a corner with only one exit next turn. This is risky and limits future options.\n\nUP is clearly better because it avoids the dead-end at (9,0) and moves me toward two apples (at (8,2) and (8,3)). The enemy is far away at (3,1) and poses no immediate threat.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving UP to (8,1), I should aim to eat the apple at (8,2) next. Then from (8,2), I can go UP to (8,3) (another apple), LEFT to (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,2). This will give me two quick apples and strengthen my lead. I should avoid moving too far right into the corner to maintain flexibility.\n\n**Decision:**\nChoose UP to move toward the apples and avoid the trap at (9,0).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Eating this apple will grow my snake by one segment (to length 16) and increase my score to 15. This is highly advantageous. After eating, my head will be at (8,2), and my tail will not move (since I grew). This move is safe and immediately rewarding.\n- LEFT (to (7,1)): This moves me away from the apples and into a safer area. However, it doesn't progress toward any immediate goal. From (7,1), I can go UP to (7,2), DOWN to (7,0) (body), or RIGHT to (8,1) (body). So only one safe follow-up (UP). This is limiting.\n- RIGHT (to (9,1)): This moves me to the right edge. From (9,1), next turn I can go UP (to (9,2)), DOWN (to (9,0) \u2014 off board? Wait, (9,0) is valid? Coordinates: (0,0) to (9,9), so (9,0) is on board. But (9,0) is currently empty? In the board state, (9,0) is shown as '.' meaning empty. However, after I move, my body will extend to (8,1) as the new first segment. So (9,0) is safe? But then from (9,1), DOWN to (9,0) is safe. Also LEFT to (8,1) (which will be body) and RIGHT off board. So actually from (9,1), safe moves would be UP and DOWN. Still, moving right doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\nUP is clearly the best move: it gets an apple and increases my lead. The enemy is far away at (3,2) and poses no threat. After eating the apple at (8,2), I will be at (8,2) with an apple at (8,3) very close. I should plan to go UP again next turn to (8,3) to eat that apple as well.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving UP to (8,2) and eating the apple, my head will be at (8,2). Next turn, I should strongly consider UP to (8,3) to eat the next apple. That would give me two apples in two turns and solidify my lead. From (8,2), other moves (LEFT to (7,2) or RIGHT to (9,2)) are also safe, but UP is optimal for scoring. After (8,3), I can then consider moving left to avoid the top-right corner or continue toward other apples.\n\n**Decision:**\nChoose UP to eat the apple at (8,2) and progress toward (8,3).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Eating this apple will grow my snake to 17 segments and increase my score to 16. This is highly advantageous. After eating, my head will be at (8,3). This move is safe and immediately rewarding.\n- LEFT (to (7,2)): This moves me away from the apples. From (7,2), next moves could be UP (to (7,3)), DOWN (to (7,1) \u2014 which has an apple, but note: (7,1) is currently an apple, but after I move, it might be eaten by someone? Actually, apples are static until eaten. So (7,1) is safe and has an apple), or RIGHT (to (8,2) \u2014 which will be body). So two safe follow-ups (UP and DOWN). This is a decent alternative.\n- RIGHT (to (9,2)): This moves me to the right edge. From (9,2), next moves: UP (to (9,3)), DOWN (to (9,1)), LEFT (to (8,2) \u2014 body). So two safe follow-ups. However, it doesn't get me closer to an apple immediately.\n\nUP is clearly the best move: it gets an apple and increases my lead. The enemy is far away at (3,3) and poses no threat. After eating the apple at (8,3), I will be at (8,3) with apples at (5,9), (3,8), (9,5), and (7,1) remaining. I should then consider moving toward (7,1) or (9,5) next.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving UP to (8,3) and eating the apple, my head will be at (8,3). Next turn, I should consider:\n- DOWN to (8,2) \u2014 body, not safe.\n- LEFT to (7,3) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,3) \u2014 empty.\n- UP to (8,4) \u2014 empty.\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT, UP. I should avoid going further right (toward (9,5)) if it leads to a dead-end, but currently it's open. Alternatively, I can go LEFT toward (7,1) which has an apple. So next turn, from (8,3), I can go LEFT to (7,3) and then DOWN to (7,2) and then to (7,1) to eat that apple. Or go UP to (8,4) and then left toward other apples. I will reassess next turn.\n\n**Decision:**\nChoose UP to eat the apple at (8,3) and continue growing my lead.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

From (7,4), next moves: UP (to (7,5) \u2014 body), DOWN (to (7,3) \u2014 body), LEFT (to (6,4) \u2014 body), RIGHT (to (8,4) \u2014 empty). So only one safe follow-up (RIGHT). This is risky as it leads to a dead-end with only one exit.\n- DOWN (to (7,2)): Moves me downward. From (7,2), next moves: UP (to (7,3) \u2014 body), DOWN (to (7,1) \u2014 apple), LEFT (to (6,2) \u2014 body), RIGHT (to (8,2) \u2014 body). So only one safe follow-up (DOWN to (7,1)). However, (7,1) has an apple! Eating it will grow me to 18 segments, and after eating, the apple disappears and I gain a point. Importantly, moving to (7,1) is safe because it is an apple (not a body segment). After eating, my head will be at (7,1) and my tail will extend (so the segment at (7,7) remains, but the rest shifts). This gives me more options.\n\nGoing DOWN to (7,2) sets me up to eat the apple at (7,1) next turn. This is highly beneficial. The enemy is far away and not a threat.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter eating the apple at (7,1), I will be at (7,1) with 17 apples. Then I can consider other apples like (2,5) or (3,8). The board has many open spaces, and I should avoid trapping myself.\n\n**Decision:**\nChoose DOWN to move toward the apple at (7,1) and eat it next turn. This is the best immediate gain and keeps me safe.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

This will let me eat the apple, growing to 18 segments and gaining a point.\n\n**Analysis:**\nMoving DOWN is forced. It is safe and beneficial. After eating the apple at (7,1), my head will be at (7,1) and my body will extend (so the tail remains at (8,7) for now). This will give me more options next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter eating, I should look to escape the crowded area. From (7,1), I can consider moving LEFT to (6,1) (which will be free after I move) or RIGHT to (8,1) (which is currently my body but will be free after I move? Actually, after I move, my body shifts: the segment at (8,1) will become the new head position? No, wait: when I grow, the tail doesn't move. So after moving DOWN to (7,1), my body becomes:\nHead: (7,1)\nBody: [(7,2), (7,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)]\nSo (6,1) and (8,1) are both body segments? Actually, (6,1) is the 9th segment and (8,1) is the 5th segment. So both are occupied. But next turn, when I move from (7,1), the tail will not advance because I just grew? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow by 1, so the tail does not move that turn. So the body remains the same length. Then next turn, when I move again, the tail will advance (unless I eat again). So from (7,1) next turn, the safe moves might be limited. I need to check:\n\nAfter I move to (7,1) and grow, the board state will change. The apple at (7,1) will be gone. The segment at (6,1) is my body (9th segment) and (8,1) is my body (5th segment). So only DOWN to (7,0) might be safe? But (7,0) is currently my body (6th segment), but after I move and grow, it will still be there. So actually, from (7,1) next turn, the only safe move might be DOWN to (7,0)? But that is a body segment. Wait, no: after I move to (7,1), the body shifts: the head is at (7,1), and the next segment is (7,2). The tail is at (8,7). So (7,0) is still occupied by the 6th segment? Actually, the list is fixed: the body doesn't shift until I move without eating. When I eat, I grow, so the tail doesn't move. So the body remains: [ (7,2), (7,3), (8,3), ... (8,7) ] and the new head is at (7,1). So (7,0) is still occupied (by the 6th segment, which is (7,0)). So from (7,1), the adjacent cells:\n- UP: (7,2) is body (first segment)\n- DOWN: (7,0) is body (6th segment)\n- LEFT: (6,1) is body (9th segment)\n- RIGHT: (8,1) is body (5th segment)\n\nAll adjacent cells are body! This means after I eat the apple at (7,1), I will be trapped and have no safe moves next turn. This is a problem.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me list the body segments after I move to (7,1) and grow:\nHead: (7,1)\nBody: [ (7,2), (7,3), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7) ]\n\nSo indeed, all four directions from (7,1) are occupied:\n- UP: (7,2) is segment 1\n- DOWN: (7,0) is segment 6\n- LEFT: (6,1) is segment 9\n- RIGHT: (8,1) is segment 5\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (7,1) will lead to certain death next turn because I will have no escape. This is a critical issue.\n\nBut is there any way out? The only hope is if an apple appears nearby, but that doesn't happen. Or if the enemy dies, but that is unlikely. So I must avoid this trap.\n\nHowever, I have no other safe moves this turn. All other directions are unsafe. So I am forced to move DOWN to (7,1) and die next turn? This seems like a design flaw in my previous move.\n\nWait, perhaps I misremembered: last turn I had head at (7,3) and moved DOWN to (7,2). That was safe. But now I am at (7,2) and only DOWN is safe. So I have no choice.\n\nBut let's double-check the board state from the given grid:\n\nAt (7,2): my head.\nUp: (7,3) is my body (first segment).\nDown: (7,1) is an apple (so it is safe to move there).\nLeft: (6,2) is my body.\nRight: (8,2) is my body.\n\nSo indeed, only DOWN is safe.\n\nTherefore, I must move DOWN to (7,1) and eat the apple. Then next turn, I will be trapped. This is unavoidable. Perhaps the game will end before then? Or maybe the enemy will die? But I have to make the move.\n\nThis is a desperate situation. I should have thought of this last turn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI have no choice but to move DOWN to (7,1) and eat the apple. Then I will have 17 apples, but likely die next turn unless a miracle happens (e.g., the enemy dies or an apple appears in a way that frees me).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Moving LEFT puts me at (1,6), one step closer to that apple and still adjacent to it. From (1,6) I will have three safe follow\u2011up directions (UP to the apple, LEFT, DOWN) while still keeping the board open. Moving UP also offers several options but does not bring me nearer to any apple in a single step, and moving RIGHT leaves fewer safe exits.  \n\nTherefore, moving LEFT maximizes upcoming flexibility and keeps the apple within reach next turn without risking collision.\n\n**Plan**  \nMove LEFT to (1,6) to approach the (1,7) apple while preserving multiple safe directions for the next turn.\n\nLEFT",

There are no safe moves. This is the trap I foresaw last turn.\n\n**Desperate Measures:**\nSince all moves are fatal, I must choose the least bad option. However, the rules state that any move into my own body kills me. Therefore, I cannot avoid death this turn.\n\n**Possible Outcomes:**\n- If I move in any direction, I die.\n- The enemy might also die this turn? But even if it does, I still die.\n- The only hope is if the enemy dies and I somehow survive, but that is impossible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI have no safe moves. I am forced to choose a move that kills me. Since all are equally fatal, I choose DOWN arbitrarily.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",
