Apples everywhere but we're NOT chasing yet \u2014 we're setting up DOMINANCE early. \ud83d\udc0d\n\nFirst, check all four moves for immediate death:\n\nUP \u2192 (6,7): empty, safe.\nDOWN \u2192 (6,5): empty, safe.\nLEFT \u2192 (5,6): empty, safe.\nRIGHT \u2192 (7,6): empty, safe.\n\nAll moves safe. Now, which one sets us up to CONTROL the board? Enemy is bottom-left quadrant. We're near center-right. If we move toward him now, we risk early head-on when we're same length \u2014 that's a tie death. Not worth. So we want to claim space, maybe go toward apples while cutting off his expansion.\n\nLook at apples close to us: (6,2) down, (5,7) up-left, (4,7) up-left, (6,1) down. But moving straight toward apple might put us in a tunnel. Let's think about future safe moves after each:\n\nUP to (6,7): From there, can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT next turn (DOWN is back into our old head \u2014 but that's empty next turn since body is only at (6,6) for one turn? Wait, we grow only if we eat apple. We haven't eaten, so next turn our tail is at (6,6)? Actually, if we don't eat, our snake moves forward, tail follows \u2014 so next turn our body will be only at (6,7) head and (6,6) tail? No \u2014 on turn 0, we have no body. Moving without eating means next turn our head is new spot, tail disappears \u2014 so we stay length 1. So actually after moving without eating, our entire snake is just the new head. So no body behind us. That means from (6,7) all 4 directions might be safe next turn except off-board or into enemy. So UP gives options.\n\nDOWN to (6,5): similar.\n\nLEFT to (5,6): closer to enemy but still far.\n\nRIGHT to (7,6): toward right edge \u2014 limits future a bit.\n\nWe want to stay central but also maybe pressure enemy by moving toward center-top where more apples are. Actually, let's check enemy's possible moves: from (2,2) he can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all safe. He'll likely go toward apple at (4,2) or (3,2) or (2,3). So he's moving right/up probably.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (5,6), we're still far. But moving UP to (6,7) gets us closer to apples at (5,7),(4,7) and also sets us to possibly cut off his path upward later.\n\nI think UP is strong \u2014 keeps us flexible, moves toward apple cluster top-left of us, and doesn't rush into danger.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Keep enemy on our left side, use right side of board as our safe zone. Grow slowly while boxing him toward edge. Avoid head-on until we have length advantage.\n\nFinal move: UP. Let's take the high ground! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s break it down and make him crash \ud83d\ude02\n\nQuick state scan:\n- Me (ID 1) head = (2,2), no body, apples = 0.\n- Opponent (ID 0) head = (6,6), apples = 0.\n- Nearby apples: (3,2) to my RIGHT, (2,3) UP \u2014 immediate tasty options.\n- No immediate collision risk with the enemy this turn (he\u2019s 8 Manhattan away). No bodies in our way.\n\nDecision process (thinking out loud for the chat):\n1) UP -> to (2,3): lands on an apple. Good growth, keeps lots of escape routes (L/R/U/D available next turn).\n2) RIGHT -> to (3,2): lands on an apple. Also good; moves me one step toward the open middle and other apples on y=2 (potential chaining along row 2).\n3) LEFT -> to (1,2): safe but gives up an apple \u2014 passive, not our style.\n4) DOWN -> to (2,1): safe but no apple and moves away from center \u2014 also passive.\n\nEliminate bad moves: none of these immediately kill me. I will NOT attempt a head-on\u2014both of us are at 0 apples, so a mutual kill is a draw and we want WINS, not ties.\n\nWhy I pick RIGHT:\n- Takes the apple at (3,2) immediately \u2014 growth +1, starts building score so we can later force head-ons when advantageous. \ud83c\udf4e\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\n- Moves toward the center of the board and toward a cluster of apples along y=2, giving a potential short-term chain (3,2) \u2192 4,2 \u2192 6,2\u2014more content, more pressure.\n- Keeps multiple escape routes open on the next turn (UP/RIGHT/DOWN available), avoiding getting boxed in. We stay aggressive and flexible. \ud83d\ude08\n- Opponent is still far; grabbing this apple gives us the leverage we want to start dominating.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Chain apples along the y=2 corridor if safe to do so to build a lead.\n- Once ahead by 1+ apples, start closing x-distance to the opponent and aim to cut off his paths to the center. Force risky head-on decisions when he\u2019s cornered.\n- Always prefer moves that keep at least 2 escape options open; don\u2019t tunnel into a dead-end unless we have a clear trade advantage.\n\nTime to eat and start the trap \u2014 RIGHT",

My neck = (3,2). LEFT \u2192 (3,2) is the neck = moving backwards = instant death. NOPE, eliminate LEFT.\n- UP \u2192 (4,3): safe. Keeps option to grab (4,4) next turn. Good space, 3 follow-up options.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,1): safe. Gets me toward (6,1) in a couple turns, also OK.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,2): safe. Direct path toward (6,2) apple two cells away. After moving RIGHT I still have UP/RIGHT/DOWN available (LEFT would be into my neck), so good mobility.\n\nOpponent check: enemy head at (5,7) with body (6,7) \u2014 far away, no immediate head-on. We\u2019re up 2 \u2192 1, so aggressive play to extend the lead is favored; if we can pressure later, we should be willing to risk head-on when our apple count is higher.\n\nWhy I pick RIGHT:\n- Fastest route to the nearby apple at (6,2) to increase our lead (eat early, dominate later).\n- Keeps at least two safe escape directions afterward (UP/DOWN/RIGHT), so we don\u2019t tunnel ourselves.\n- Maintains control of the central horizontal lane \u2014 perfect for boxing later and baiting a head-on when we\u2019re longer.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to (5,2). Next turn push to (6,2) and grab that apple (+1). With a 2-apple lead, start pressing vertical control and shrink his safe approach lanes. Don\u2019t get cornered \u2014 always keep a route that preserves at least 2 exit choices.\n\nLet\u2019s go \u2014 chop his options and force the crash when we\u2019ve got the edge.

No other bodies occupy (6,2). Moving RIGHT is clean and immediately increases our lead.\n- After taking (6,2) we still have multiple follow-up exits (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), so we don't trap ourselves.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- RIGHT now to eat (6,2) -> +1 apple, extend lead to 3\u20132.\n- Use new length to claim central lanes.

NOPE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,2): safe, open space, keeps options (can go to 7,3 / 7,1 / 8,2 later).\n- UP \u2192 (6,3): safe, moves toward (6,4) apple, good mobility (6,4 / 5,3 / 7,3 available next).\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,1): apple at (6,1) \u2014 we eat and GROW. Safe; after eating we\u2019ll have an extra segment and still multiple exits (6,0 / 5,1 / 7,1).\n\nRisk & opponent scan:\n- Opponent head at (3,7) with neck at (4,7). They CAN\u2019T move right into us (that\u2019s their neck), options are LEFT/UP/DOWN from their head \u2014 they\u2019re far, no immediate head-on threat this turn.\n- Eating (6,1) gives us +1 apple (4 vs their 3). That swing lets us safely force more aggressive head-on plays later when they try to contest space.\n\nWhy I pick this:\n- DOWN gets the apple immediately \u2014 domination through growth. We want size to bully lanes and force collisions when convenient.\n- It keeps at least three exits next turn (no tight funnel), so we don\u2019t get boxed in.\n- We\u2019re not risking a head-on while tied \u2014 instead we take the lead to make head-on favorable later. Savage playbook: grow first, then clamp.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Grab (6,1) now \u2192 reach 4 apples.\n- Use extra length to move toward central lanes and start hemming the opponent vertically (push up the board to cut his safe territory).\n- Keep two escape routes at all times; only initiate a head-on when our apple lead is clear and the geometry favors us.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT \u2014 DOWN",

LEFT balances growth opportunities and map control \u2014 perfect for forcing plays once we\u2019re bigger.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to pressure central columns.\n- If opponent drifts down/right, cut across to trap; keep at least two escape routes each move.\n- Grab the (5,0) apple if safe on the following turn to stretch lead, then push up into the 4\u20135 columns to start compressing their safe space.\n- Only force a head-on when our apple lead and geometry guarantee it favors us.\n\nLET\u2019S RUN THIS \u2014 LEFT",

NOPE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,1): that\u2019s our neck (backwards). Illegal. NOPE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,1): safe. Moves toward the opponent\u2019s column and keeps options open.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,0): safe AND there\u2019s an apple at (5,0). Immediate +1 apple = 5 vs their 3. Strong play.\n\nWhy I PICK DOWN:\n- Grabbing apples = control. If we take (5,0) now we increase our lead (5\u21923), which makes forcing a head-on much more favorable later. Big brain move for aggressive play.\n- Moving DOWN still leaves two good exits next turn (LEFT to 4,0 or RIGHT to 6,0). Not a dead-end trap \u2014 we keep mobility.\n- LEFT is tempting for aggression, but it forgoes a guaranteed apple and lessens our ability to credibly force risky head-on confrontations later. We want the score buffer.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (5,0) now to stretch lead.\n- Patrol the bottom row (4\u20136 columns) to control the corridor; use lateral movement to bait the opponent toward risky head-on attempts.\n- Keep at least two escape options each turn; only call a head-on when our apple lead + geometry guarantees we win the tiebreak.\n- If opponent drifts down into our corridor, compress and refuse exits until they misstep.\n\nLET\u2019S TAKE THAT APPLE AND CRANK THE PRESSURE \u2014 DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Neck (backwards) = (5,0) \u2014 RIGHT is illegal (would be moving into our neck). DOWN = (4,-1) off-board \u2192 immediate death. That leaves UP and LEFT.\n\nEvaluate all 4 directions:\n- UP \u2192 (4,1): legal. Not occupied by any body. Leaves follow-ups of UP (4,2) or LEFT (3,1) \u2014 both look clear. Good vertical access toward the center/opp. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,-1): off the board. Dead. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,0): legal. Leaves follow-ups LEFT (2,0) or UP (3,1). Both are open \u2014 still at least two exits. \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,0): our neck \u2014 backwards into our body. Instant death. \u274c\n\nRisk analysis & aggression read:\n- We\u2019re up 5 \u2192 4. We can legitimately force a head-on later, but only if we don\u2019t get trapped. Both UP and LEFT preserve multiple follow-up options, so neither is a tunnel right now.\n- LEFT keeps us on the bottom row and lets us pressure columns 3\u21921 and contest the (1,0) apple if safe \u2014 extra apple = stronger leverage for a future head-to-head. Tempting to secure content and widen the lead.\n- UP brings us toward the center faster and shortens vertical distance to the enemy (they\u2019re at (2,4)), which is aggressive too \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t give immediate access to that easy bottom-row apple.\n- Opponent can\u2019t move into their neck (2,5). They can head DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from (2,4). We want to funnel them west/south; holding the bottom row and stepping left helps create that corridor.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns \u2014 this will be your next \u201clast rationale\u201d snapshot):\n- Push left along the bottom (columns 3\u21921), threaten the (1,0) apple when safe to expand our lead.\n- Keep at least two safe exits each turn; avoid one-way tunnels unless we KNOW a head-on wins us the game.\n- If the opponent commits north/east into tight space, close the net and force a head-on (we have the edge).\n- If they run, choke off escape routes and pick apples to keep the lead and momentum.\n\nWe keep it aggressive, but smart \u2014 control columns, grab apples when under no risk, and only force collisions when the geometry favors us.\n\nLEFT",

NO DIRECT COLLISION.\n\nIF WE EAT THE APPLE DOWN AT (2,3), WE GROW TO LENGTH 6 \u2014 TYING HIS LENGTH! \ud83c\udfaf THEN WE CAN FORCE A HEAD-ON WITH EQUAL LENGTH? ACTUALLY, HEAD-ON WITH EQUAL LENGTH KILLS BOTH \u2014 BUT IF WE HAVE MORE APPLES AFTER EATING, WE'D WIN IF BOTH DIE! WE HAVE 4, HE HAS 5. AFTER EATING, WE HAVE 5, HE HAS 5 \u2014 TIE! SO HEAD-ON WOULD BE A DRAW. WE NEED TO GET AHEAD FIRST.\n\nBUT BOXING HIM IS PRIORITY! IF WE GO DOWN AND EAT, OUR NEW BODY: HEAD (2,3), THEN (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7). TAIL STAYS AT (4,7) BECAUSE WE ATE. LENGTH 7? WAIT \u2014 WE STARTED LENGTH 5, EAT MAKES LENGTH 6. MY BAD: CURRENT LENGTH 5 (HEAD + 4 BODY). EAT MAKES LENGTH 6. SO BODY: HEAD (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). TAIL (4,7) MOVES? NO \u2014 WHEN YOU EAT, YOU DON'T MOVE TAIL THAT TURN, SO TAIL STAYS AT (4,7). SO LENGTH 6: HEAD (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). PLUS THE OLD TAIL (4,7) BECOMES NEW SEGMENT? ACTUALLY, GROWTH MEANS YOU ADD A NEW SEGMENT AT THE TAIL END AFTER MOVING. SO AFTER MOVING HEAD TO (2,3), THE TAIL STAYS AT (4,7) AND A NEW SEGMENT IS ADDED WHERE THE TAIL WAS? NO \u2014 STANDARD SNAKE: YOU MOVE HEAD FORWARD, TAIL FOLLOWS UNLESS YOU EAT. IF YOU EAT, TAIL DOESN'T MOVE, SO LENGTH INCREASES BY 1. SO THE OLD TAIL (4,7) REMAINS, AND THE REST OF BODY SHIFTS. SO NEW BODY: HEAD (2,3), THEN (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7). LENGTH 7? THAT'S WRONG \u2014 WE STARTED LENGTH 5, EAT MAKES LENGTH 6. LET'S COUNT: HEAD (2,4) CURRENT, BODY: (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) \u2192 THAT'S 4 BODY SEGMENTS + HEAD = 5 TOTAL. AFTER MOVING DOWN TO (2,3) AND EATING, NEW BODY: HEAD (2,3), THEN OLD HEAD (2,4) BECOMES NECK, THEN (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). TAIL (4,7) IS GONE BECAUSE TAIL MOVES? NO \u2014 IF WE EAT, TAIL DOES NOT MOVE. SO TAIL STAYS AT (4,7) AND WE ADD A NEW SEGMENT THERE? THAT WOULD MAKE LENGTH 6: HEAD (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) \u2014 AND (4,7) IS EXTRA? I'M CONFUSED. LET'S SIMPLIFY: AFTER EATING, LENGTH = OLD LENGTH + 1 = 6. THE BODY LIST WILL BE: HEAD (2,3), THEN THE FIRST 5 SEGMENTS OF OLD BODY (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). THE OLD TAIL (4,7) IS NOW PART OF BODY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T MOVE TAIL? ACTUALLY, IN SNAKE, WHEN YOU EAT, YOU DON'T REMOVE THE TAIL CELL, SO THE TAIL CELL STAYS. SO THE BODY LIST LENGTH INCREASES BY 1, INCLUDING THE OLD TAIL. SO YES, LENGTH 6: HEAD (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). (4,7) IS GONE BECAUSE TAIL MOVES? I THINK I'M OVERTHINKING. LET'S TRUST THE GAME LOGIC: WE GROW BY 1, SO LENGTH 6. OUR NEW BODY WILL BE HEAD + 5 BODY SEGMENTS.\n\nANYWAY, DOWN EATS APPLE, TIES SCORE 5-5, AND LENGTH 6 VS HIS 6.\n\nNOW, OTHER OPTIONS: LEFT TO (1,4) OR RIGHT TO (3,4) DON'T EAT. BUT THEY KEEP US CLOSE TO BLOCK ENEMY'S UPWARD ESCAPE. ENEMY AT (4,0) CAN GO UP TO (4,1) OR LEFT TO (3,0). IF HE GOES UP, HE'S AT (4,1). WE WANT TO POSITION TO CUT OFF HIS PATH NORTH. FROM (2,4), GOING LEFT OR RIGHT KEEPS US IN MIDDLE ROWS.\n\nSAFETY OF NEXT MOVES AFTER EACH OPTION:\n- DOWN to (2,3) & EAT: NEXT TURN FROM (2,3), OPTIONS: UP (2,4) \u2014 WILL BE OUR BODY (NECK), BLOCKED; LEFT (1,3) DOT; DOWN (2,2) DOT; RIGHT (3,3) DOT. 3 OPTIONS. GOOD.\n- LEFT to (1,4): NEXT TURN FROM (1,4), OPTIONS: UP (1,5) DOT; LEFT (0,4) 'A' APPLE; DOWN (1,3) DOT; RIGHT (2,4) \u2014 WILL BE OUR BODY (NECK), BLOCKED. 3 OPTIONS.\n- RIGHT to (3,4): NEXT TURN FROM (3,4), OPTIONS: UP (3,5) \u2014 OUR BODY, BLOCKED; LEFT (2,4) \u2014 OUR BODY, BLOCKED; DOWN (3,3) DOT; RIGHT (4,4) 'A' APPLE. 2 OPTIONS (DOWN OR RIGHT). RISKIER \u2014 FEWER PATHS.\n\nRIGHT HAS ONLY 2 SAFE FOLLOW-UPS \u2014 AVOID THAT TRAP! \u274c\n\nSO BETWEEN DOWN (EAT, 3 OPTIONS) AND LEFT (NO EAT, 3 OPTIONS), DOWN IS BETTER \u2014 WE GET THE APPLE, TIE SCORE, AND GROW. GROWTH HELPS DOMINATE BOARD! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: AFTER EATING AT (2,3), WE'RE LENGTH 6, SCORE 5. ENEMY STILL 5. NEXT TURN, FROM (2,3), MOVE TO (1,3) OR (3,3) TO BLOCK ENEMY'S POTENTIAL PATH UP THROUGH CENTER. ENEMY AT (4,0) MIGHT GO UP TO (4,1), THEN (4,2), ETC. WE CAN MOVE EAST-WEST TO CUT OFF ROWS y=2, y=3. AIM TO FORCE HIM INTO WALL OR OUR BODY. ONCE WE GET SCORE LEAD, FORCE HEAD-ON! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

They cannot go RIGHT into (2,3) \u2014 that\u2019s their own body.\n- No enemy move can immediately collide with (3,2) this turn, so UP is safe from instant head-on.\n- LEFT (2,1) hugs the bottom area and reduces escape routes \u2014 tempting for the apple at (1,0) but it funnels us and makes us easier to box.\n- RIGHT (4,1) keeps us near our own body (5,1) and edges us into a tighter corridor on the right; less flexible.\n\nWhy UP:\n- Moves us toward the center and toward the enemy\u2019s vertical range without committing to a tight corridor. More escape options (LEFT, RIGHT, UP next turn) \u2192 preserves mobility and trapping potential. \ud83c\udf00\n- Keeps options to pressure the opponent\u2019s flanks; we can pivot to cut them off without forcing an immediate head-on while tied 5\u20135. If we build positional advantage and get ahead on apples, we can then force a head-to-head on our terms. \ud83d\udc80\n- Safer and more aggressive than sliding onto the bottom row or crowding our own body.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- UP now to grab center. Next turn evaluate opponent\u2019s move: if they drop or drift left, pivot LEFT then UP to corral; if they escape upward, chase and block lateral exits.\n- Avoid risking a head-on while tied. Force head-on only if we gain +1 apple or a clear board advantage.\n- Use our body to create a wall along the bottom/right while we pressure the opponent\u2019s corridor from above.\n\nFinal move:\nUP",

RIGHT would be fine, but UP keeps our options and bait potential for corralling the rival without risking a double KO.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- UP now to gain vertical pressure and preserve multiple follow-ups.\n- If opponent hugs the bottom/left, pivot LEFT+UP to hem them in; if they try to escape upward, chase and cut lateral exits while avoiding moving into the opponent\u2019s immediate target cell (no suicide into 2,2).\n- Stay aggressive but don\u2019t force head-on while apples are tied \u2014 force collisions only if we gain +1 or can guarantee we win the exchange. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc80\n\nUP",

Yeah we want \u2019em, but the target is the other snake. Score\u2019s tied 5\u20135, so no reckless double KO plays. Keep options open, stay aggressive, and bait him into our trap.\n\nQuick map read (head at 3,3):\n- UP -> (3,4): free. Towards the 4,x apple corridor (4,4/4,5) but left is blocked by opponent body at (2,4). Good pressure, slightly constrained on the left.\n- DOWN -> (3,2): our neck (backwards) \u2014 ILLEGAL. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (2,3): currently occupied by the opponent\u2019s body segment \u2014 would be moving into a body (not a tail) = DEATH. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (4,3): free. Opens immediate access to the 4,4 apple and gives multiple safe exits next turn (UP to apple, RIGHT deeper, or DOWN to open space).\n\nOpponent head at (1,1) can only go LEFT (0,1), RIGHT (2,1) or DOWN (1,0) \u2014 they cannot go UP because (1,2) is their body. So they can\u2019t threaten a direct head-to-head with either of our safe choices this turn. That means we should pick the move that preserves the most safe follow-ups while pressing toward apples/corridors.\n\nDecision rationale:\n- DOWN and LEFT are instant no\u2019s (illegal/death).  \n- Between UP and RIGHT: RIGHT is the more flexible, aggressive option. It gets us closer to the apple corridor at x=4, preserves multiple escape lanes, and avoids getting squeezed by the opponent body at (2,4). We DON\u2019T want to force a head-on while tied \u2014 so we\u2019ll take the safe, pressure-building route.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Rush RIGHT -> then UP to contest the 4,4 / 4,5 apples if safe.  \n- If opponent pushes upward into the corridor, cut his lateral exits and box him left/bottom. If he tries to run around the bottom, corral him toward the board edge and force him into his own body.  \n- Only bait a head-on if we\u2019re up an apple or can guarantee he takes the crash. Otherwise, keep occupying the center corridor and grow advantageously.\n\nLET\u2019S GET IT \u2014 final move:\n\nRIGHT",

Safe from immediate head-on \u2014 opponent can\u2019t reach that cell this move.\n- RIGHT -> (5,3): safe, keeps options open and space to maneuver.\n- DOWN -> (4,2): safe, but moves away from the apple corridor and toward the lower board (less pressure).\n- LEFT -> (3,3): ILLEGAL \u2014 that\u2019s our neck (would be moving backwards into our body). Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n\nOpponent head (2,1) can go to (2,2), (2,0) or suicide into our body at (3,1) (unlikely). They cannot threaten (4,4) this turn. Score is tied 5\u20135 \u2014 we do NOT want a risky head-on now unless we guarantee a win. So what's the play?\n\nDecision: TAKE THE APPLE. Moving UP to (4,4) gives us +1 immediately, puts us ahead 6\u20135, and locks down the x=4 corridor (with another apple at 4,5 nearby). That both increases our leverage for future head-to-heads and pressures the opponent into tighter movement options. It\u2019s aggressive, clean, and maximizes follow-up choices (we can contest 4,5, or pivot around the corridor). No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\nShort plan for next turns (notes to self):\n- Eat (4,4) now, then contest/secure (4,5) if safe to get further lead.\n- Once up a point, start corralling the rival left/bottom using our body along x=4 to reduce his escape lanes.\n- Avoid premature head-on until we hold the apple advantage (we\u2019ll bait him into his own body or force him into a tight edge).\n\nLET\u2019S FINISH THIS \u2014 final move:\n\nUP",
