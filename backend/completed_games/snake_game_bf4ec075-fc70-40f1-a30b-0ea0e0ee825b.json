Moves north toward the apple cluster around (7,6)/(7,9) and keeps me away from the enemy\u2019s dense column at x=0.\n\nNo candidate moves immediately collide with any snake body or go off-board. Enemy head (5,9) is far away so immediate head-on risk is low.\n\nChoice rationale: UP (to 2,6) is preferred because it advances toward the higher-value cluster of apples (especially (7,6) and (7,9)), keeps the snake in open central space with multiple follow-up options, and avoids the enemy\u2019s crowded left-side column. It also preserves flexibility to turn right later toward apples while not getting squeezed against my own body.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue heading toward the top-right apple cluster, prioritizing (7,6) then (7,9) or (8,3) if safer.\n- Avoid column x=0 and the enemy\u2019s body path; keep distance from snake #1\u2019s head and its long body on the left.\n- Re-evaluate each turn to avoid head-on collisions and to not trap myself against my own body.\n\nUP",

The enemy\u2019s long body is mostly on the left; avoid moving into that (LEFT is already illegal).\n- Moving RIGHT preserves multiple follow-up options (continue east to the apple cluster, or pivot up/down as needed) and is the shortest route to the nearest high-value apple at (7,6).\n\nShort plan:\n- Push east toward (7,6) to contest/collect that apple, then decide between (7,9) or the lower apples depending on enemy movement.\n- Avoid the enemy\u2019s left-side column (x=0\u20131) and re-check for head-on risks each turn.
