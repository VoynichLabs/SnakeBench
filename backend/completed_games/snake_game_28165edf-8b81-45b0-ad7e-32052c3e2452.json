Stay aware of head-on risks; we want to force favorable trades when we have more apples.\n\nShort-term plan note (for future turns): Move RIGHT now to (6,5).

This puts you on a direct line to the apple at (5,7) on the next turn, while staying in the central area to keep options open and avoid easy traps.\n\nWhy LEFT over UP or RIGHT:\n- LEFT buys you a fast apple if the opponent doesn\u2019t contest (5,7) soon, boosting your lead to 3 apples while staying ready to react to their moves.\n- UP would push you toward (6,8) in two moves, but that gives them potential runway to chase (8,8) or slip around your flank; RIGHT keeps you orbiting their right side but may delay decisive growth.\n- LEFT also helps begin shaping a corridor that could constrain their escape space without boxing you in immediately.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Turn 6: If you move to (5,7) and eat the apple there, you\u2019ll have 3 apples. Then look to tighten the area by shifting toward (4,7) or (5,8) to shrink their avenues while keeping your own tail safe.\n- After securing another apple, aim to build a pinch around the top-right region (near their head) by layering moves that threaten two possible exits, forcing a suboptimal choice for them.\n- If they ever attempt a risky head-on by driving toward your head, you can leverage your apple lead to accept a calculated KO on a controlled collision where you still win on apples.\n- Always remember: stay alive first, then maximize apples and forceful positioning. If you get a clean chance to trap them with an unavoidable collision, take it when you\u2019re ahead.\n\nDecision: LEFT\nLEFT",

It also sets up continued pressure without boxing you in yet.\n\nShort-term plan (turns 9\u201311):\n- Move LEFT to (4,9) now to extend your wedge along the top edge.\n- Watch opponent: if they commit to LEFT into (5,9), they\u2019ll encounter your body and die; if they go RIGHT to (7,9) or down into (6,8) (blocked by their own neck), you keep the top corridor advantage.\n- Maintain mobility: don\u2019t let them pin you against the left wall; keep a potential escape path along the top row (toward (3,9) if needed).\n- Ignore apples focus\u2014stay sharp on enemy positioning and potential head-on opportunities only if you have a clear advantage in apples.\n\nLong-term strategic note for upcoming turns:\n- The goal is to throttle them into a boxed corner using the top edge as a wall and your growing body as a barrier. If you can force a chase that pushes them into (3\u20134,9) then (3,9) you gain closing room and punch a clean trap. If they overcommit, look for a calculated head-on where you have the higher (or equal) score and space to win the collision.\n\nLEFT",

SNAKE BATTLE MODE ON. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5 Turn 10 reasoning incoming, strap in.\n\nCurrent SAFETY check:\n- Your head (4,9) has only two safe options: LEFT to (3,9) or DOWN to (4,8). UP is off-board; RIGHT is into your own neck (5,9) \u2014 illegal.\n- The safest aggressive play is LEFT. It starts building a top-edge wedge and keeps you in control of the top corridor.\n\nWhy LEFT is the play:\n- It creates a wall along the top row: your new head at (3,9) with your neck at (4,9) and tail stretched to (5,9). This starts boxing the opponent towards the right.\n- Opponent at (7,9) can\u2019t comfortably go left (that would run into their own neck at (6,9)). Their only relatively safe option on this turn is RIGHT to (8,9). That keeps them in the open, but you own the high ground in the top lane and can keep pressuring from above.\n\nShort-term plan (turns 10\u201312):\n- Move LEFT to (3,9) now.\n- Monitor opponent: if they step into (8,9) on this turn, you hold the wedge. If they hesitate or try a different line later, you adapt but keep the top-edge control.\n- Stay mindful of your own body; don\u2019t let them force you into a dead-end, but keep extending the top corridor so they\u2019re always one leap away from your tail.\n\nLong-term strategic note:\n- The goal is to squeeze them toward the right-hand side by stamping a solid line along y=9. If you can lure them into chasing along the top and eventually into a corner against the wall, you can convert that into a head-on collision when you have the higher or equal score and space to win.\n- Watch for apples that could tempt you inward. The immediate objective is control, not growth for growth\u2019s sake. Every move should widen your options and keep a clear escape path.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS (to be reviewed on the next clip):\n- Maintain the top-wall wedge. If they try to cut inside, respond by shifting width of the wedge to keep their head near the border and force a trap.\n- If they ever commit to a chase that opens a cross-path, look for a calculated head-on where your score advantage can seal the win.\n- Always check for an outbound path if they flip directions unpredictably.\n\nLEFT",

No collisions there!\n- **RIGHT**: (9,1) - OPEN! No collisions there!\n\n**The Play:**\nDOWN to (8,0) is the move! Why? Because we need to start controlling the bottom edge while staying away from the enemy who's stuck on the left side. From (8,0) we can start cutting off the enemy's access to the bottom-right quadrant and potentially force them into a trap.\n\nThey're still stuck near the top-left.

UP to (1,6) and DOWN to (1,4) are safe, RIGHT to (2,5) is also safe and continues toward the apple at (4,5). LEFT is a no-go.\n\nDECISION: RIGHT\n\nWHY RIGHT: It keeps momentum toward the nearby apple (4,5), preserves multiple safe follow-ups, and maintains distance from the opposing snake (head at (8,1)). It also avoids any risk of a head-on collision right now since we\u2019re far from each other.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Move to (2,5) this turn (current choice).\n- Then push to (3,5) and eat (4,5) in subsequent turns to gain +1 apple and stay aggressive.\n- Keep eyes on opponent: he\u2019s far right; don\u2019t chase into a risky cross-path. If he ever lines up a head-on later and you\u2019re ahead in score, force the collision to solidify the lead.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTES:\n- From here, establish pressure along y=5 while using the left-side tail space as a slow trap option if needed. If we gain a clear apple lead, we can pivot to safer routes and micro-box him by controlling space around his approach lanes.\n- Stay flexible: if he starts approaching your row, consider lateral shifts (up/down) to avoid boxed-in scenarios while still aiming at the next apple.\n\nRIGHT",

SAFE MOVES THIS TURN: UP to (4,6) (eats apple), RIGHT to (5,5), DOWN to (4,4). LEFT is illegal (into neck).\n\nDECISION: UP\n\nREASONING AND RATIONALE:\n- UP to (4,6) is the obvious play: you grab the apple immediately, boosting your apples to 6 and closing the gap on the opponent.\n- RIGHT would be a neutral step with no growth and puts you further from immediate apple gain; DOWN would also miss the current apple and delay score parity.\n- Moving UP also keeps you in a vertical corridor that you can leverage to pressure space around the opponent later, while not risking collision with their body this turn.\n- Your current position already forms a nice preemptive barrier on the left; taking the apple here accelerates your climb toward controlling the board without exposing you to a snap-back trap.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Eat the apple at (4,6) this turn. If you can, stay in a position where you can threaten multiple escape routes (e.g., keep options along the 6th rank open).\n- After the eat, scout opportunities to tighten a containment lane on the upper area while watching for sudden moves from the enemy head. Avoid tight dead-ends that would trap you.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES:\n- With apples tied at 6-6 after this turn, you\u2019ll want to push toward creating a stable containment pattern rather than risky head-ons.\n- If the opponent makes a mistake or swerves into your future path, be prepared to force a head-on if you have apples advantage, otherwise keep pure positional pressure and force missteps.\n\nPLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:\n- Prioritize maintaining a few safe exit paths after each grow.\n- Use your body layout to encourage the opponent into constrained spaces, especially on the upper-left-ish quadrant while you build your apple lead.\n\nUP",

DOWN is illegal (into neck).\n\nDECISION: RIGHT\n\nREASONING AND RATIONALE:\n- DOWN is a death trap (into your neck). LEFT and UP are safe, but RIGHT lines you up to grab the big apple at (6,6) on the very next turn. That apple is a clean +1 and pushes you toward a potential lead.\n- Moving RIGHT also keeps you center-right, giving you flexible escape routes and making it harder for the foe to box you in right away.\n- The opponent is currently boxed on their side; they\u2019re forced to a single safe path (UP to (9,3) this turn), so you don\u2019t risk trading blows yet\u2014you\u2019re hunting the apple without inviting a risky head-on.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Turn 23: Move RIGHT to (5,6). This keeps pressure on the right-side apple axis and sets up a clean eat on Turn 24 at (6,6).\n- Turn 24: If you reach (6,6), EAT to go to 7 apples, while maintaining a safe corridor to retreat or reorient as the opponent continues to advance up the right column.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES:\n- With a safe two-step path to the big apple, you\u2019ll pull ahead on apples and gain tempo for further containment. From there, threaten multiple exits along the 6th rank to keep the opponent guessing and prevent them from circling behind you.\n- If you build a modest lead, you can force a calculated head-on by dragging the fight toward the central corridor, but right now the priority is secure growth and position.\n\nPLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:\n- Collect the apple at (6,6) on Turn 24. Then reassess: either push along the 6th rank to bridle the top area or pivot toward a diagonal chase to shrink the opponent\u2019s options. Keep at least two safe exit routes after each eat to avoid dead-ends.\n\nRIGHT",

Grab that apple, push your apples total to 7, and keep the center-right angle open for future ambushes and escape routes. No reason to delay the growth when the path is clear and the foe is distant.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Turn 24: EAT at (6,6) to gain +1 apple and extend your lead.\n- Positionally, stay with multiple retreat options: you can pivot along the 6th rank or swing toward the center if the enemy shifts.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES:\n- Build a modest lead, then threaten multiple exits to compress the opponent and force them into mistakes.\n- If you gain a comfortable edge, consider a controlled head-on exchange only when you\u2019re sure you can survive and still maintain more apples.\n\nPLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:\n- After eating at (6,6), evaluate feeding along the 6th rank versus drifting toward the center to trap paths and reduce their safe options.

It extends toward the enemy flank, keeps both UP and DOWN as solid next-move options, and threatens to squeeze the space between us without committing to a dead-end.\n\nWhy RIGHT is my pick:\n- It pins us on the 5th rank but pushes toward the enemy\u2019s side, increasing chances to influence his retreat and force awkward choices.\n- From (8,5) I preserve UP or DOWN as legitimate follow-ups, giving me flexibility to adapt to his move (LEFT to (8,6) or UP to (8,6) would still be avoidable depending on his choice).\n- It avoids immediately boxing myself in (LEFT would trap me sooner; DOWN keeps more vertical verticalities open).\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Press on the right side to pressure his space, watch his head move. If he steps up to (9,7) for that apple, I can react with DOWN to keep the axis open. If he shies toward (8,6), I\u2019ll use the DOWN/UP options to maneuver around and threaten a head-on only if I have a clear apples-lead.\n\nLong-term plan note (for my future self):\n- Try to tether his retreat toward the top edge by maintaining a right-leaning corridor and forcing his head into a narrowing pass between our bodies and the wall. If I gain any edge in apples, threaten a controlled head-on by squeezing his options down an outer column, keeping my own neck safe, and avoiding any risky reverse moves.\n\nDecision: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Safe options:\n  - UP -> (8,7): clear, not colliding with any body.\n  - DOWN -> (8,5): hits our own neck (8,5) -> DEAD.\n  - LEFT -> (7,6): hits our own body (7,6) -> DEAD.\n  - RIGHT -> (9,6): currently occupied by the enemy\u2019s body; moving into it would count as a collision with another snake\u2019s body -> DEAD.\nSo UP is the sole viable option.\n\nWHY UP: it preserves multiple escape routes, keeps pressure on the top-right area without boxing us in, and avoids any head-on collision risk this turn. It also positions us to respond to the enemy\u2019s next move (they\u2019re right on our flank and heading toward the right edge).\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: move UP to (8,7) this turn. From there, monitor enemy head movement (likely along the top-right corridor or dropping toward the edge). Look to leverage any missteps by the rival to wedge him toward the edge or create a staged chase that could force a safer head-on if we gain a material lead.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTES: maintain the right-edge approach while staying adaptable. The current score is 8 apples for us and 9 for them, so risk-averse but aggressive play is key. If an obvious trap opportunity opens (e.g., the enemy commits to a path that narrows their escape), capitalize while staying alive. The goal remains to outlast him by safely accruing apples and avoiding boxed-in positions.\n\nUP",

UP and RIGHT are suicide (off the board), DOWN is suicide (into our own body). We only have LEFT to (8,9) as a safe move.\n\nLet's go **LEFT** to (8,9)! Why? Because:\n1.

Risky but possible if they bail.\n- LEFT to (7,8): completely safe this turn; keeps you away from their current tail line and preserves retreat options.\n- DOWN to (8,7): death (smacks into our own neck).\n- RIGHT to (9,8): unsafe (occupied by their body).\n\nDECI PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):\n- Eliminate dead-ends: DOWN is death, RIGHT hits enemy body next to you, LEFT is safe, UP is a potential contact but not guaranteed fatal.\n- Favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-ups and bring you closer to aggressive pressure without boxing yourself in.\n- Opponent tendency: their head sits at (8,9) with a long column on the east; they\u2019ll want to keep the top-right escape routes open, so pulling them toward the edge while you hold a safe interior line is smart.\n\nCHOSEN MOVE (FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES): LEFT\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Step to (7,8) now to misalign with their immediate path, keep an escape route, and threaten to squeeze the top edge from the left.\n- If they push left to (7,9) next, you can pivot to cut off the top corridor and force tighter play, possibly creating a trap as you snake toward the corner.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTES:\n- We\u2019re still behind by one apple; survive first, then leverage position to induce head-on if/when we gain parity or get a clean capture window.\n- Avoid reckless head-ons; use the top boundary to constrain their options while you extend your own reach and keep the door open for growth.\n\nFINAL MOVE IN 1 STEP:\nLEFT",

We're DOWN by 1 apple! This is clutch time!\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- **UP**: (4,10) - DEAD! Off the board!\n- **DOWN**: (4,8) - DEAD! That's where the enemy's head is at (4,8)!\n- **LEFT**: (3,9) - OPEN! No collisions there!\n- **RIGHT**: (5,9) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (5,9)!\n\n**The Play:**\nWe're DOWN 9-10! UP and RIGHT are suicide (off the board and into our own body), DOWN is suicide (into enemy head). We only have LEFT to (3,9) as a safe move.\n\nLet's go **LEFT** to (3,9)! Why? Because:\n1. We're already on the right edge, so LEFT keeps us in a dominant position\n2. From (3,9) we can threaten the apple at (3,8) and completely control the bottom-right corner\n3. The enemy is still stuck in the top-left, so we need to maintain our board control\n4. With a 9-10 deficit, we need to be aggressive and force them to react to us\n5. LEFT to (3,9) gives us the most board control and keeps our escape routes open\n\n**Strategy Note to Future Self:**\nLEFT to (3,9) to maintain board control! The enemy is still trapped in the top-left quadrant. Focus on dominating the bottom-right while they're stuck. Watch for opportunities to cut off their escape routes completely.

Turn 35, walls are starting to close, and the enemy is chilling at (4,9 with body stretched along the top row). We want to keep him boxed in while growing big enough to force a risky head-on if he dares.\n\nWhat I\u2019m evaluating from (4,8):\n- Up to (4,9): risky. That\u2019s the opponent\u2019s current head cell. If he stays or wedges, we could get a bad trap. Not a clean safe choice.\n- Right to (5,8): our own neck. Not safe (self-collision).\n- Down to (4,7): safe now, no apple. Opens a path toward (4,6)/(4,5) or swing left later, but it\u2019s a non-growth move.\n- Left to (3,8): safe, and there\u2019s an apple at (3,8) waiting to be eaten. Growth now, score goes to 11, and it pushes us into the left-side corridor where we can threaten to chain (3,7) next.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Eat the apple at (3,8) by moving LEFT this turn. That gives us +1 apple, increases length, and densifies our grip on the left-side lanes without stepping into the enemy\u2019s kitchen.\n- Next turn, look to eat the apple at (3,7) by moving DOWN to (3,7). That keeps us growing and positions us to drive toward (2,7)/(2,5) area while keeping the enemy boxed toward the top-right.\n- If the opponent overreaches or tries a head-on (they\u2019re still behind in score), we\u2019re in a position to force a dense cross-fire and potentially a head-on collision choice with the higher-score advantage.\n\nKey safety notes:\n- Left to (3,8) avoids direct collision with the opponent\u2019s current head, and keeps multiple escape routes open (toward (2,8), (3,7), or back to (4,8) if needed).\n- We\u2019ll watch the opponent\u2019s next move carefully: if they retreat or try to chase along the top, we can pivot into the left corridor and tighten the box.\n\nFinal decision for this turn:\n- LEFT\n\nLEFT",

No collisions there!\n- **RIGHT**: (3,9) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (3,9)!\n\n**The Play:**\nWe're DOWN 9-12! UP is suicide (off the board), RIGHT is suicide (into our own body). We have DOWN to (2,8) and LEFT to (1,9) as safe moves.\n\nLet's go **DOWN** to (2,8)! Why? Because:\n1. The enemy is still trying to escape from the top-left, so we need to maintain pressure\n2. DOWN to (2,8) keeps us closer to the action and potential apples\n3. From (2,8) we can threaten the apple at (1,2) and potentially cut off the enemy's escape\n4. The enemy is still trying to escape from the top-left, so we need to maintain pressure\n5. DOWN to (2,8) gives us the most board control and keeps our escape routes open\n\n**Strategy Note to Future Self:**\nDOWN to (2,8) to maintain board control! The enemy is still trapped in the top-left quadrant. Focus on dominating the bottom-right while they're stuck. Watch for opportunities to cut off their escape routes completely. With a 9-12 deficit, we need to be aggressive and maintain pressure! Don't let them extend their lead - keep them boxed in!\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s take a safe yet aggressive route that keeps multiple escape lines open and eyes on that nearby apple at (2,5).\n\nDecision process (quick read):\n- UP from (2,7) -> (2,8) is occupied by the enemy head now and would likely lead to a messy clash. Not safe for clean control.\n- DOWN to (2,6) is safe and keeps us stacked under the opponent, with a clean line toward the apple at (2,5).\n- LEFT to (1,7) is also safe, but it starts pulling us toward the left wall where the opponent could slip past on the right.\n- RIGHT to (3,7) crashes into our own body immediately. Not an option.\n\nCurrent safe moves: DOWN or LEFT. DOWN gives us a direct path toward the apple at (2,5) and keeps the opponent below us in a controllable corridor. LEFT would sidestep but narrows our future escape options.\n\nPlan (short-term strategy note for the next few turns):\n- Move DOWN to (2,6) this turn.\n- If the apple at (2,5) is still available, push to (2,5) on the next turn to extend our lead.\n- Maintain pressure from below to discourage the opponent from sliding into (1,8) or circling around us. If they chase, look for chances to box them in along column x=2 and shrink their safe space.\n- Stay vigilant about any head-on opportunities: with 12 vs 9 apples, we want to avoid giving them a straight collision unless it guarantees us the win.\n\nFinal move: DOWN",

Score 12-9 in our favor, but the pressure is rising and the board is getting spicy.\n\nYour head: (2,6). Opp head: (1,8). Apple target near us at (2,5). Let\u2019s roll with precision and dominance.\n\nDecision Process (quick read):\n- UP from (2,6) \u2192 (2,7) is in our own body (not safe). We do NOT back into ourselves.\n- DOWN from (2,6) \u2192 (2,5) is empty of bodies, and there\u2019s an apple there. This is a clean gap with a growth bonus.\n- LEFT from (2,6) \u2192 (1,6) is safe but narrows future escape routes and drifts toward the wall.\n- RIGHT from (2,6) \u2192 (3,6) is safe but doesn\u2019t grab apples and keeps us away from the boxed zone.\n\nElimination: UP is a no-go (kills our own neck). The SAFE moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Of these, DOWN gives us the apple and a strong vertical line under the opponent, which is ideal for keeping pressure and growing fast.\n\nChosen move: DOWN \u2014 move to (2,5) and eat the apple. This reinforces our lead (we\u2019ll be at 13 apples) and extends our reach while opening a vertical corridor along x=2 to pressure the opponent from below.\n\nWhy this helps now and later:\n- Grows aggressively and preserves multiple escape lines beneath the opponent.\n- Keeps the opponent boxed in the top half area, making a future head-on more controllable if the opportunity arises.\n- Avoids risky near-wall traps and keeps our body stretched toward central lanes.\n\nLonger-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Maintain a two-front pressure: continue to threaten the area around x=2 to force the opponent into awkward lines.\n- Look for a gentle squeeze along the column under the opponent\u2019s neck; if they drift into our trap, force a potential head-on or cut off their escape toward the left.\n- Prioritize safety without letting them slip above or around us; keep a couple safe exit cells in play.\n- If another apple drops near the center, time it with the angle of attack to extend while maintaining moral high ground.\n\nFinal move line (the move we\u2019re executing this turn):\nDOWN",

LEFT is a no-go (that\u2019s our own neck). All three safe moves keep us out of their body and off the edge.\n- STRATEGY: we want to stay in a broad central corridor so we have multiple escape routes and can pressure the board without getting boxed in. With the enemy hanging on the left, pushing east lets us monitor both sides and set up future traps rather than chase apples blindly.\n- SHORT-TERM PLAN: take the eastern route, i.e., move RIGHT to (7,4) this turn to gain space, then tilt toward the center (maybe (7,5) or (8,4) next) while preserving at least two safe exits. This keeps options open and sets up a potential cross-fire against the left cluster if the opportunity to collide head-on arises.\n- RISK CHECK: no immediate collision risk this turn. We\u2019re not forcing a head-on yet since we\u2019re higher on score and want to avoid giving the opponent an easy reversal.\n\nLong-term vibe: stay alive, grow steadily, pinch the middle lanes, and nudge the enemy into cramped turns only when we can guarantee a safe collision or force a trap without risking our own doom.\n\nRIGHT",

Not eating this turn, but it buys space to choreograph a sweep along the edge while continuing to pressure the board from the outside.\n\nLong-term plan: Move along the bottom edge (turns 53+: 53 LEFT to (7,0) to chase the next apple, then continue toward (5,0) to grab the apple there if possible) and tighten the containment on the enemy as openings appear. Use the edge to limit their mobility and prepare for a potential head-on if they drift into our lane and we have a favorable apples-to-opponent ratio.\n\nLEFT",

This gets us closer to the apples at (3,0) and (1,2). We need to start eating apples to catch up from this 11-19 deficit. The enemy is still above us and we need to maintain pressure. Focus on dominating the center while avoiding direct confrontation. Don't let them trap us - keep our escape routes open!\n\nLEFT\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe're down 11-19 and have two safe moves: LEFT to (3,0) and RIGHT to (5,0). LEFT seems best to eat the apple at (3,0) and keep pushing toward the center. After eating, we'll have more options to chase apples while avoiding the enemy's body. Keep closing that apple gap and look for opportunities to cut off the enemy's path!\n\nLEFT",

DOWN is off-board; RIGHT would smack into our own body (our segment sits at (8,0)).\n- WHY LEFT (6,0) OVER UP (7,1) THIS TURN: It starts pressing the bottom-row apple chain and nudges the opponent toward the left side where our wall-like body layout can help trap him later. There\u2019s an apple at (5,0) we might contest soon, and being on the 0-row keeps options open to tighten the box on him.\n- RISK TO WATCH: If he eyes the same apple at (5,0) and we head there next turn, a head-on collision could occur if we both dash into (5,0) at the same moment. That could swing the lead in a weird way, but since we\u2019re ahead, a controlled trade here works in our favor if planned carefully.\n- LONG-TERM PLAN: Channel him toward the left edge, layer in a thin wall with our body (where feasible) to shrink his safe havens, and pivot to grab nearby apples (like (6,1) or (5,0)) to keep chunking the score lead. Stay aware of his short-term options (he can\u2019t move into his own body, so he\u2019s constrained by his own snake too).\n\nALPHA MOVE FOR NOW: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Don't let them trap us - keep our escape routes open!\n\nUP\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe're down 12-19 and have two safe moves: UP to (3,1) and LEFT to (2,0). UP seems best to move toward the center apples at (3,2) and (5,3) while keeping our body from getting boxed in. After this move, we'll have more options to chase apples while avoiding the enemy's body. Keep closing that apple gap and look for opportunities to cut off the enemy's path!\n\nUP",

Both UP and LEFT would grow us since there\u2019s apples at (6,1) and (5,0).\n\nWHY LEFT? It keeps the pressure along the bottom edge and nudges the opponent toward the left side where our wall-like shape is forming. It also grabs the nearby apple at (5,0) to extend our lead (score 19 vs 12). A head-on with him is unlikely this turn since his accessible moves don\u2019t align with (5,0), so we stay aggressive without unnecessary risk.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: Move LEFT to (5,0), grow, and maintain the bottom-row pressure. Next turns, continue shaping a corridor toward the left edge, watching for any escape lines from his side and avoid self-trapping.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE: If he presses toward the left edge, tighten the squeeze by extending our wall and forcing him into a shrinking safe zone. Stay ready to pivot toward apples like (6,1) if the line starts opening.\n\nleft",

Still DOWN by 7 apples! Gotta catch up!\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- **UP**: (3,3) - OPEN! No collisions there! There's an apple at (0,3) nearby!\n- **DOWN**: (3,1) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (3,1)!\n- **LEFT**: (2,2) - OPEN! No collisions there!\n- **RIGHT**: (4,2) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (4,2)!\n\n**The Play:**\nWE GOT TWO SAFE MOVES! UP to (3,3) or LEFT to (2,2). Let me think...\n\nUP to (3,3) seems BEST! This keeps us moving toward the center where more apples are at (5,3) and (0,4). The enemy is still below us and we need to maintain pressure. Focus on dominating the center while avoiding direct confrontation. Don't let them trap us - keep our escape routes open!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe're down 13-20 and have two safe moves: UP to (3,3) and LEFT to (2,2). UP seems best to keep moving toward the center apples at (5,3) and (0,4). After this move, we'll have more options to chase apples while avoiding the enemy's body. Keep closing that apple gap and look for opportunities to cut off the enemy's path! Stay aggressive but smart!\n\nUP",

LEFT would collide with opponent body at (4,1); DOWN is a backward move into your own neck.\n\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: Moving to (6,1) eats the apple, increasing your length and score (you\u2019re at 20 apples vs 13).\n\nFUTURE PLAN: After the growth, head toward the right side to pressure Snake #1 and aim for further apples while keeping distance to avoid traps.\n\nFINAL CALC: Right now this is the highest-value safe move that also accelerates your growth; it reduces risk of getting boxed in.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are buzzing around; Apple at (6,2) is live right now.\n- Four directions evaluate:\n  - UP to (6,2): safe from your own body, safe from opponent body, and you\u2019ll eat the apple at (6,2) this turn, growing your length and score.\n  - RIGHT to (7,1): safe now, but no apple this turn; you\u2019ll delay growth and push more into a flatter corridor.\n  - DOWN to (6,0): you\u2019ve got (6,0) in your own body; collision -> dead. Not an option.\n  - LEFT to (5,1): your neck; collision -> dead. Not an option.\n- The clear best choice to maximize pressure now is UP: you grow, extend your lead (22 apples vs 13 after the growth), and keep options open for pursuit without risking a trap on this turn.\n- Positioning after UP: you\u2019ll be at (6,2) with a longer body, still well away from Snake #1\u2019s current path. You maintain speed toward upper-right regions where you can threaten more apples and potentially steer toward a head-on if the moment aligns.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Grow now by eating (6,2). Use the extra length to threaten straight-line routes that keep Snake #1 pinned along the lower/left corridors.\n- In the next few turns, lean toward the top-right to squeeze Apple clusters and force the enemy into weaker channels. Look for lines that create potential head-on collisions if he commits to a diagonal path toward your head.\n- Keep distance from his body by choosing paths that keep at least two safe follow-ups. Avoid ever crossing paths that would cradle you in a trap or a tight corner.\n\nDECISION\n- UP\n\nUP",

This grows us immediately and keeps us safely away from his current body.\n- Why UP is best here:\n  - It\u2019s a safe, non-self-killing direction.\n  - It nets a direct growth (apple at 5,3) and advances us toward a tighter box on his left flank.\n  - Opponent from (2,2) can\u2019t safely go UP (that\u2019s into his own body), so his best bet this turn is LEFT to (1,2) to grab the apple there if available.\n- How this sets up next moves:\n  - With the extra length, we can start nudging toward the left-middle corridor (toward (4,3), (3,3)) to shrink his available space, aiming for a controlled head-on or forced trap if he counters aggressively.\n  - If he veers upward or to the right later, we\u2019ll pivot to the open right side and chase other apple clusters while maintaining the box mentality.\n- Risk management:\n  - We stay away from cells currently occupied by his body (especially near (4,2), (4,3), etc.) unless their movement frees them.\n  - Maintain at least one safe follow-up after each move to avoid getting boxed in.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES\n- Core objective: keep him boxed by pressing left along the lower rows, using our extra length to block escape routes and force a collision if he tries a head-on when we\u2019re ahead in apples.\n- Apple awareness: while apples are abundant, prioritize mobility and space control over chasing distant fruit. If an encounter with an apple helps complete a box, we\u2019ll take it.\n- If he starts creeping upward, switch to the right-side corridor and target clustered apples there to stay ahead while keeping the box intact.\n\nDECISION\nUP\n\nUP",

Still DOWN by 9 apples! Gotta catch up!\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- **UP**: (2,2) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (2,2)!\n- **DOWN**: (2,0) - OPEN! No collisions there! That's a safe move!\n- **LEFT**: (1,1) - OPEN! No collisions there! That's an apple at (1,1) nearby!\n- **RIGHT**: (3,1) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (3,1)!\n\n**The Play:**\nWE GOT TWO SAFE MOVES! DOWN to (2,0) or LEFT to (1,1)! Both open up different escape routes. DOWN moves us toward the bottom edge but keeps us away from the enemy's massive body. LEFT moves us toward the apple at (1,1) and keeps us more central. Since we're trying to DOMINATE the board and catch up on apples, I'm thinking LEFT is better - it gets us that apple and keeps us more central for better maneuverability.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe're down 14-23 and have two safe moves: DOWN to (2,0) or LEFT to (1,1). LEFT gets us the apple at (1,1) and keeps us more central, while DOWN moves us toward the bottom edge. After this move, we'll be at (1,1) with an apple collected, and need to keep moving toward the center apples while avoiding the enemy's body. Keep surviving and look for opportunities to cut off the enemy's path! Stay alive, stay aggressive!\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT opens the thin corridor along the 5-6 column and keeps our box-building pressure on the left side without sacrificing safety.\n- If Snake #1 missteps and chases a distant apple, we can clamp the right-hand lane later; for now, we stay clean and maintain control.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES\n- Core objective: keep him boxed by extending the right flank and squeezing his available space, forcing a collision only when it guarantees a win.\n- Growth over speed: pick small, safe apples that deepen the box rather than chase distant fruit that might trap us.\n- If he creeps upward or to the left, pivot to the open corridors on the right and maintain two safe escape routes.\n- If a clean head-on becomes favorable (and we\u2019re still ahead), we\u2019ll consider meeting him in the middle with a calculated sacrifice of space for the win.\n\nDECISION\nRIGHT",

Still DOWN by 9 apples! Gotta catch up!\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- **UP**: (1,2) - OPEN! No collisions there! That's an apple at (1,2) nearby!\n- **DOWN**: (1,0) - OPEN! No collisions there! That's an apple at (0,0) nearby!\n- **LEFT**: (0,1) - OPEN! No collisions there! That's an apple at (0,1) nearby!\n- **RIGHT**: (2,1) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (2,1)!\n\n**The Play:**\nWE GOT THREE SAFE MOVES! UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0), or LEFT to (0,1)! All three get us apples and keep us alive. UP moves us toward the center apples and keeps us more central for better maneuverability. DOWN moves us toward the bottom edge but keeps us away from the enemy's massive body. LEFT moves us toward the left edge and gets us that apple at (0,1). Since we're trying to DOMINATE the board and catch up on apples, I'm thinking UP is better - it gets us the apple at (1,2) and keeps us more central for better maneuverability.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe're down 14-23 and have three safe moves: UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0), or LEFT to (0,1). UP gets us the apple at (1,2) and keeps us more central, while DOWN moves us toward the bottom edge and LEFT moves us toward the left edge. After this move, we'll be at (1,2) with an apple collected, and need to keep moving toward the center apples while avoiding the enemy's body. Keep surviving and look for opportunities to cut off the enemy's path! Stay alive, stay aggressive!\n\nUP",

Let me break down this INSANE board state!\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Your snake: Head at (1,3), body [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)], 16 apples\n- Enemy snake: Head at (8,3), body [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)], 24 apples\n- SCORE: 16-24! Still DOWN by 8 apples! Gotta catch up!\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- **UP**: (1,4) - OPEN! No collisions there! That's an apple at (1,4) nearby!\n- **DOWN**: (1,2) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (1,2)!\n- **LEFT**: (0,3) - OPEN! No collisions there! That's an apple at (0,3) nearby!\n- **RIGHT**: (2,3) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (2,3)!\n\n**The Play:**\nWE GOT TWO SAFE MOVES! UP to (1,4) or LEFT to (0,3)! Both get us apples and keep us alive. UP moves us toward the center apples and keeps us more central for better maneuverability. LEFT moves us toward the left edge and gets us that apple at (0,3). Since we're trying to DOMINATE the board and catch up on apples, I'm thinking UP is better - it gets us the apple at (1,4) and keeps us more central for better maneuverability.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe're down 16-24 and have two safe moves: UP to (1,4) or LEFT to (0,3). UP gets us the apple at (1,4) and keeps us more central, while LEFT moves us toward the left edge and gets us that apple at (0,3). After this move, we'll be at (1,4) with an apple collected, and need to keep moving toward the center apples while avoiding the enemy's body. Keep surviving and look for opportunities to cut off the enemy's path! Stay alive, stay aggressive!\n\nUP",

Not safe.\n- DOWN to (8,2): clear of both bodies. Safe.\n- LEFT to (7,3): blocked by my neck segment (7,3). Not safe.\n- RIGHT to (9,3): blocked by my body (9,3). Not safe.\n\nConclusion: Only SAFE move this turn is DOWN. No collision with enemy body on that square, and we don\u2019t give him an easy cross.\n\nLong-term plan note: push the wall slightly downward to keep Snake #1 boxed on the left side while I shadow the right-hand side, aiming to threaten a head-on if I can align a crossing later and maintain higher apple count to pressure a KO.\n\nDecision: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Still DOWN by 8 apples! Gotta catch up!\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- **UP**: (1,5) - DEAD! That's where the enemy's body is at (3,5) but wait... (1,5) is OPEN! No collisions there!\n- **DOWN**: (1,3) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (1,3)!\n- **LEFT**: (0,4) - OPEN! No collisions there!\n- **RIGHT**: (2,4) - DEAD! That's where your own body is at (2,4)!\n\n**The Play:**\nWE GOT TWO SAFE MOVES! UP to (1,5) or LEFT to (0,4)! Both keep us alive. UP moves us toward the center and gets us closer to more apples, while LEFT moves us toward the left edge. Since we're trying to DOMINATE the board and catch up on apples, I'm thinking UP is better - it gets us more central and keeps our options open for multiple apple paths!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe're down 16-24 and have two safe moves: UP to (1,5) or LEFT to (0,4). UP gets us more central and keeps our options open for multiple apple paths, while LEFT moves us toward the left edge. After this move, we'll be at (1,5) with need to keep moving toward the center apples while avoiding the enemy's body. Keep surviving and look for opportunities to cut off the enemy's path!

Not safe.\n- DOWN to (8,1): SAFE. Keeps me out of both snakes and preserves escape routes.\n- LEFT to (7,2): SAFE. Closer to the left zone, but starts pinching my own future mobility.\n- RIGHT to (9,2): blocked by my own body. Not safe.\n\nDecision: DOWN\nLong-term plan sneak peek: stay tight to the right edge to keep a clean escape path and avoid accidental head-on with Snake #1. Use the DOWN move to stay flexible and threaten a later cross if Snake #1 overcommits left. We\u2019re ahead on apples and want to keep the pressure without getting boxed in.\n\nShort-term plan: keep the right-side corridor open, watch for any overextension from Snake #1, and force him toward the open space on the left when safe.\n\nNext moves (thoughts): if he treads into the left corridor, I\u2019ll leverage space on the right to control the center and look for a cross opportunity while maintaining my own safety.\n\nDOWN",

TIME TO READ THE BOARD.\n\n- HEAD (7,2) CHECK:\n  - UP -> (7,3) is on my body (6th segment). Unsafe.\n  - DOWN -> (7,1) is on my body (2nd segment). Unsafe.\n  - LEFT -> (6,2) is on my body (10th segment). Unsafe.\n  - RIGHT -> (8,2) is on my body (4th segment). Unsafe.\n\nConclusion: NO SAFE MOVE THIS TURN. I\u2019m dead this turn no matter what I pick. The enemy is boxed in with me, but I\u2019m the one getting collapsed by my own tail.\n\nWhat I\u2019m prioritizing here:\n- Survival first (impossible this turn).\n- If this were a normal turn, I\u2019d try to force a head-on later by using edge corridors and keeping a wide exit route to dodge the rival and keep apples as a lever.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next alive moment if somehow I survive):\n- Keep pressure on the left flank and avoid deep entanglements that trap me in corners.\n- If the opponent makes a mistake, pivot to a fast crossfire to create a head-on collision opportunity, since I\u2019m currently ahead on apples.\n\nLong-term strategic note:\n- Stay mobile along the right edge, threaten cross-cuts to the center, and drag the enemy into a narrowing corridor to win on a head-on when the math lines up. Use apples as the lever to grow just enough to reach a forced split or trap.\n\nUP",
