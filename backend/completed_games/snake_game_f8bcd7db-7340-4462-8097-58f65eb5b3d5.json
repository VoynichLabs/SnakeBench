I'll want to keep an eye on Snake #1's position and adjust my route if necessary. Since my previous move was an attempt to avoid taking unnecessary risks, I should look for a move that allows me to inch closer to the apple without sticking my neck out.\n\nIn this case, moving LEFT to (1, 7) feels like a good next step.
