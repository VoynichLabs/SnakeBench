            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2, currently at (4,6), and it's alone because its body is empty. The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (0,9) with an empty body too, so no immediate threat from it right now.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (5,3), (4,1), (8,1), (6,7), and (3,1). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without risking death.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. The one at (4,1) is directly below me since I'm at (4,6). That's only 5 moves down. The apple at (3,1) is to the left and down, and (8,1) is to the right and down. The others are further away.\n\nSince I'm at (4,6), moving down would take me towards (4,5), (4,4), etc. But wait, moving down from (4,6) would actually decrease my y-coordinate because y increases upwards. So, moving down from (4,6) would take me to (4,5), then (4,4), and so on. That means the apple at (4,1) is directly below me, requiring me to move down five times.\n\nAlternatively, moving left or right would take me towards the other apples. For example, moving left from (4,6) would take me to (3,6), then (3,5), etc., towards (3,1). Similarly, moving right would take me towards (5,3) and (8,1).\n\nI need to consider the shortest path. The apple at (4,1) is the closest, only 5 moves down. The others are further away. So, maybe I should go for the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving towards (4,1) is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (0,9), which is far away, so no immediate collision risk. My body is empty, so I don't have to worry about hitting myself unless I make a U-turn, which I shouldn't do.\n\nAnother consideration is whether any other snake might block me, but since the enemy is at (0,9), it's not in the way. So, moving down seems safe.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the future. If I take the apple at (4,1), I'll grow, but then I might have to decide where to go next. Alternatively, maybe taking a different apple would give me a better position for future moves.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is also nearby. From (4,6), moving right twice would take me to (6,6), then up once to (6,7). That's three moves. The apple at (4,1) is five moves. So, (6,7) is actually closer. Hmm, I didn't realize that earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me recalculate. From (4,6), moving right to (5,6), then (6,6), then up to (6,7). That's three moves. So, (6,7) is closer than (4,1), which is five moves down.\n\nSo, maybe I should prioritize the closer apple at (6,7). That would give me a point faster. But I need to make sure that moving towards (6,7) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (4,6) to (6,7) is clear. There are no apples or snakes in the way. So, moving right twice and then up once seems doable.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down to (4,1), I can get that apple, but it's further away. So, perhaps taking the closer apple is better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,7) is at (6,7), which is two to the right and one up. So, the direction would be right, right, up. But I can only move one direction per turn, so I need to plan the path.\n\nBut for the next move, I have to choose a single direction. So, from (4,6), moving right would take me to (5,6). Then next turn, I can move right again to (6,6), and then up to (6,7). That seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (4,6) would take me to (4,7), but that's not directly towards any apple. So, maybe not the best move.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is at (6,7), which is two right and one up. So, if I move right twice and then up, I can get there in three moves. That's better than going down five times.\n\nSo, perhaps the best move is to go right towards (6,7). But I need to make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apple without getting blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (4,1) first because it's directly below me, and I can get it in five moves, but I can also consider the other apples.\n\nWait, another apple is at (3,1), which is to the left and down. From (4,6), moving left once to (3,6), then down five times to (3,1). That's six moves. So, longer than going to (6,7).\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,7), requiring three moves. So, I should aim for that.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,3) is also in the middle. From (4,6), moving right once to (5,6), then down three times to (5,3). That's four moves. So, that's closer than (6,7), which is three moves. Wait, no, (6,7) is three moves, (5,3) is four moves. So, (6,7) is still closer.\n\nWait, no, from (4,6) to (5,3): right once to (5,6), then down three times to (5,3). That's four moves. So, (6,7) is three moves, which is better.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go towards (6,7). So, my first move should be to the right, taking me to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving right is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy is at (0,9), so no. My body is empty, so no collision risk. So, moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the other apples. For example, the apple at (8,1) is far to the right and down. That would take a lot of moves, so probably not worth it right now.\n\nSo, the plan is to move right towards (6,7). So, next move: RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points quickly, I'll move towards the closest apple at (6,7). Moving right from (4,6) to (5,6) is the first step.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. The one at (4,1) is directly below me since I'm at (4,6). That's only 5 moves down. The apple at (3,1) is to the left and down, and (8,1) is to the right and down. The others are further away.\n\nSince I'm at (4,6), moving down would take me towards (4,5), (4,4), etc. But wait, moving down from (4,6) would actually decrease my y-coordinate because y increases upwards. So, moving down from (4,6) would take me to (4,5), then (4,4), and so on. That means the apple at (4,1) is directly below me, requiring me to move down five times.\n\nAlternatively, moving left or right would take me towards the other apples. For example, moving left from (4,6) would take me to (3,6), then (3,5), etc., towards (3,1). Similarly, moving right would take me towards (5,3) and (8,1).\n\nI need to consider the shortest path. The apple at (4,1) is the closest, only 5 moves down. The others are further away. So, maybe I should go for the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving towards (4,1) is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (0,9), which is far away, so no immediate collision risk. My body is empty, so I don't have to worry about hitting myself unless I make a U-turn, which I shouldn't do.\n\nAnother consideration is whether any other snake might block me, but since the enemy is at (0,9), it's not in the way. So, moving down seems safe.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the future. If I take the apple at (4,1), I'll grow, but then I might have to decide where to go next. Alternatively, maybe taking a different apple would give me a better position for future moves.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is also nearby. From (4,6), moving right twice would take me to (6,6), then up once to (6,7). That's three moves. The apple at (4,1) is five moves. So, (6,7) is actually closer. Hmm, I didn't realize that earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me recalculate. From (4,6), moving right to (5,6), then (6,6), then up to (6,7). That's three moves. So, (6,7) is closer than (4,1), which is five moves down.\n\nSo, maybe I should prioritize the closer apple at (6,7). That would give me a point faster. But I need to make sure that moving towards (6,7) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (4,6) to (6,7) is clear. There are no apples or snakes in the way. So, moving right twice and then up once seems doable.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down to (4,1), I can get that apple, but it's further away. So, perhaps taking the closer apple is better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,7) is at (6,7), which is two to the right and one up. So, the direction would be right, right, up. But I can only move one direction per turn, so I need to plan the path.\n\nBut for the next move, I have to choose a single direction. So, from (4,6), moving right would take me to (5,6). Then next turn, I can move right again to (6,6), and then up to (6,7). That seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (4,6) would take me to (4,7), but that's not directly towards any apple. So, maybe not the best move.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is at (6,7), which is two right and one up. So, if I move right twice and then up, I can get there in three moves. That's better than going down five times.\n\nSo, perhaps the best move is to go right towards (6,7). But I need to make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apple without getting blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (4,1) first because it's directly below me, and I can get it in five moves, but I can also consider the other apples.\n\nWait, another apple is at (3,1), which is to the left and down. From (4,6), moving left once to (3,6), then down five times to (3,1). That's six moves. So, longer than going to (6,7).\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,7), requiring three moves. So, I should aim for that.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,3) is also in the middle. From (4,6), moving right once to (5,6), then down three times to (5,3). That's four moves. So, that's closer than (6,7), which is three moves. Wait, no, (6,7) is three moves, (5,3) is four moves. So, (6,7) is still closer.\n\nWait, no, from (4,6) to (5,3): right once to (5,6), then down three times to (5,3). That's four moves. So, (6,7) is three moves, which is better.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go towards (6,7). So, my first move should be to the right, taking me to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving right is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy is at (0,9), so no. My body is empty, so no collision risk. So, moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the other apples. For example, the apple at (8,1) is far to the right and down. That would take a lot of moves, so probably not worth it right now.\n\nSo, the plan is to move right towards (6,7). So, next move: RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points quickly, I'll move towards the closest apple at (6,7). Moving right from (4,6) to (5,6) is the first step.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2, currently at (4,6), and it's alone because its body is empty. The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (0,9) with an empty body too, so no immediate threat from it right now.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (5,3), (4,1), (8,1), (6,7), and (3,1). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without risking death.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. The one at (4,1) is directly below me since I'm at (4,6). That's only 5 moves down. The apple at (3,1) is to the left and down, and (8,1) is to the right and down. The others are further away.\n\nSince I'm at (4,6), moving down would take me towards (4,5), (4,4), etc. But wait, moving down from (4,6) would actually decrease my y-coordinate because y increases upwards. So, moving down from (4,6) would take me to (4,5), then (4,4), and so on. That means the apple at (4,1) is directly below me, requiring me to move down five times.\n\nAlternatively, moving left or right would take me towards the other apples. For example, moving left from (4,6) would take me to (3,6), then (3,5), etc., towards (3,1). Similarly, moving right would take me towards (5,3) and (8,1).\n\nI need to consider the shortest path. The apple at (4,1) is the closest, only 5 moves down. The others are further away. So, maybe I should go for the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving towards (4,1) is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (0,9), which is far away, so no immediate collision risk. My body is empty, so I don't have to worry about hitting myself unless I make a U-turn, which I shouldn't do.\n\nAnother consideration is whether any other snake might block me, but since the enemy is at (0,9), it's not in the way. So, moving down seems safe.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the future. If I take the apple at (4,1), I'll grow, but then I might have to decide where to go next. Alternatively, maybe taking a different apple would give me a better position for future moves.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is also nearby. From (4,6), moving right twice would take me to (6,6), then up once to (6,7). That's three moves. The apple at (4,1) is five moves. So, (6,7) is actually closer. Hmm, I didn't realize that earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me recalculate. From (4,6), moving right to (5,6), then (6,6), then up to (6,7). That's three moves. So, (6,7) is closer than (4,1), which is five moves down.\n\nSo, maybe I should prioritize the closer apple at (6,7). That would give me a point faster. But I need to make sure that moving towards (6,7) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (4,6) to (6,7) is clear. There are no apples or snakes in the way. So, moving right twice and then up once seems doable.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down to (4,1), I can get that apple, but it's further away. So, perhaps taking the closer apple is better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,7) is at (6,7), which is two to the right and one up. So, the direction would be right, right, up. But I can only move one direction per turn, so I need to plan the path.\n\nBut for the next move, I have to choose a single direction. So, from (4,6), moving right would take me to (5,6). Then next turn, I can move right again to (6,6), and then up to (6,7). That seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (4,6) would take me to (4,7), but that's not directly towards any apple. So, maybe not the best move.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is at (6,7), which is two right and one up. So, if I move right twice and then up, I can get there in three moves. That's better than going down five times.\n\nSo, perhaps the best move is to go right towards (6,7). But I need to make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apple without getting blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (4,1) first because it's directly below me, and I can get it in five moves, but I can also consider the other apples.\n\nWait, another apple is at (3,1), which is to the left and down. From (4,6), moving left once to (3,6), then down five times to (3,1). That's six moves. So, longer than going to (6,7).\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,7), requiring three moves. So, I should aim for that.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,3) is also in the middle. From (4,6), moving right once to (5,6), then down three times to (5,3). That's four moves. So, that's closer than (6,7), which is three moves. Wait, no, (6,7) is three moves, (5,3) is four moves. So, (6,7) is still closer.\n\nWait, no, from (4,6) to (5,3): right once to (5,6), then down three times to (5,3). That's four moves. So, (6,7) is three moves, which is better.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go towards (6,7). So, my first move should be to the right, taking me to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving right is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy is at (0,9), so no. My body is empty, so no collision risk. So, moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the other apples. For example, the apple at (8,1) is far to the right and down. That would take a lot of moves, so probably not worth it right now.\n\nSo, the plan is to move right towards (6,7). So, next move: RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points quickly, I'll move towards the closest apple at (6,7). Moving right from (4,6) to (5,6) is the first step.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2, currently at (4,6), and it's alone because its body is empty. The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (0,9) with an empty body too, so no immediate threat from it right now.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (5,3), (4,1), (8,1), (6,7), and (3,1). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without risking death.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. The one at (4,1) is directly below me since I'm at (4,6). That's only 5 moves down. The apple at (3,1) is to the left and down, and (8,1) is to the right and down. The others are further away.\n\nSince I'm at (4,6), moving down would take me towards (4,5), (4,4), etc. But wait, moving down from (4,6) would actually decrease my y-coordinate because y increases upwards. So, moving down from (4,6) would take me to (4,5), then (4,4), and so on. That means the apple at (4,1) is directly below me, requiring me to move down five times.\n\nAlternatively, moving left or right would take me towards the other apples. For example, moving left from (4,6) would take me to (3,6), then (3,5), etc., towards (3,1). Similarly, moving right would take me towards (5,3) and (8,1).\n\nI need to consider the shortest path. The apple at (4,1) is the closest, only 5 moves down. The others are further away. So, maybe I should go for the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving towards (4,1) is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (0,9), which is far away, so no immediate collision risk. My body is empty, so I don't have to worry about hitting myself unless I make a U-turn, which I shouldn't do.\n\nAnother consideration is whether any other snake might block me, but since the enemy is at (0,9), it's not in the way. So, moving down seems safe.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the future. If I take the apple at (4,1), I'll grow, but then I might have to decide where to go next. Alternatively, maybe taking a different apple would give me a better position for future moves.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is also nearby. From (4,6), moving right twice would take me to (6,6), then up once to (6,7). That's three moves. The apple at (4,1) is five moves. So, (6,7) is actually closer. Hmm, I didn't realize that earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me recalculate. From (4,6), moving right to (5,6), then (6,6), then up to (6,7). That's three moves. So, (6,7) is closer than (4,1), which is five moves down.\n\nSo, maybe I should prioritize the closer apple at (6,7). That would give me a point faster. But I need to make sure that moving towards (6,7) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (4,6) to (6,7) is clear. There are no apples or snakes in the way. So, moving right twice and then up once seems doable.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down to (4,1), I can get that apple, but it's further away. So, perhaps taking the closer apple is better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,7) is at (6,7), which is two to the right and one up. So, the direction would be right, right, up. But I can only move one direction per turn, so I need to plan the path.\n\nBut for the next move, I have to choose a single direction. So, from (4,6), moving right would take me to (5,6). Then next turn, I can move right again to (6,6), and then up to (6,7). That seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (4,6) would take me to (4,7), but that's not directly towards any apple. So, maybe not the best move.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is at (6,7), which is two right and one up. So, if I move right twice and then up, I can get there in three moves. That's better than going down five times.\n\nSo, perhaps the best move is to go right towards (6,7). But I need to make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apple without getting blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (4,1) first because it's directly below me, and I can get it in five moves, but I can also consider the other apples.\n\nWait, another apple is at (3,1), which is to the left and down. From (4,6), moving left once to (3,6), then down five times to (3,1). That's six moves. So, longer than going to (6,7).\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,7), requiring three moves. So, I should aim for that.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,3) is also in the middle. From (4,6), moving right once to (5,6), then down three times to (5,3). That's four moves. So, that's closer than (6,7), which is three moves. Wait, no, (6,7) is three moves, (5,3) is four moves. So, (6,7) is still closer.\n\nWait, no, from (4,6) to (5,3): right once to (5,6), then down three times to (5,3). That's four moves. So, (6,7) is three moves, which is better.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go towards (6,7). So, my first move should be to the right, taking me to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving right is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy is at (0,9), so no. My body is empty, so no collision risk. So, moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the other apples. For example, the apple at (8,1) is far to the right and down. That would take a lot of moves, so probably not worth it right now.\n\nSo, the plan is to move right towards (6,7). So, next move: RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points quickly, I'll move towards the closest apple at (6,7). Moving right from (4,6) to (5,6) is the first step.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2, currently at (4,6), and it's alone because its body is empty. The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (0,9) with an empty body too, so no immediate threat from it right now.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are five of them. Their positions are (5,3), (4,1), (8,1), (6,7), and (3,1). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without risking death.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. The one at (4,1) is directly below me since I'm at (4,6). That's only 5 moves down. The apple at (3,1) is to the left and down, and (8,1) is to the right and down. The others are further away.\n\nSince I'm at (4,6), moving down would take me towards (4,5), (4,4), etc. But wait, moving down from (4,6) would actually decrease my y-coordinate because y increases upwards. So, moving down from (4,6) would take me to (4,5), then (4,4), and so on. That means the apple at (4,1) is directly below me, requiring me to move down five times.\n\nAlternatively, moving left or right would take me towards the other apples. For example, moving left from (4,6) would take me to (3,6), then (3,5), etc., towards (3,1). Similarly, moving right would take me towards (5,3) and (8,1).\n\nI need to consider the shortest path. The apple at (4,1) is the closest, only 5 moves down. The others are further away. So, maybe I should go for the closest apple first to maximize points quickly.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving towards (4,1) is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy snake is at (0,9), which is far away, so no immediate collision risk. My body is empty, so I don't have to worry about hitting myself unless I make a U-turn, which I shouldn't do.\n\nAnother consideration is whether any other snake might block me, but since the enemy is at (0,9), it's not in the way. So, moving down seems safe.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the future. If I take the apple at (4,1), I'll grow, but then I might have to decide where to go next. Alternatively, maybe taking a different apple would give me a better position for future moves.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is also nearby. From (4,6), moving right twice would take me to (6,6), then up once to (6,7). That's three moves. The apple at (4,1) is five moves. So, (6,7) is actually closer. Hmm, I didn't realize that earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me recalculate. From (4,6), moving right to (5,6), then (6,6), then up to (6,7). That's three moves. So, (6,7) is closer than (4,1), which is five moves down.\n\nSo, maybe I should prioritize the closer apple at (6,7). That would give me a point faster. But I need to make sure that moving towards (6,7) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the path from (4,6) to (6,7) is clear. There are no apples or snakes in the way. So, moving right twice and then up once seems doable.\n\nAlternatively, if I go down to (4,1), I can get that apple, but it's further away. So, perhaps taking the closer apple is better.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,7) is at (6,7), which is two to the right and one up. So, the direction would be right, right, up. But I can only move one direction per turn, so I need to plan the path.\n\nBut for the next move, I have to choose a single direction. So, from (4,6), moving right would take me to (5,6). Then next turn, I can move right again to (6,6), and then up to (6,7). That seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, moving up from (4,6) would take me to (4,7), but that's not directly towards any apple. So, maybe not the best move.\n\nWait, the apple at (6,7) is at (6,7), which is two right and one up. So, if I move right twice and then up, I can get there in three moves. That's better than going down five times.\n\nSo, perhaps the best move is to go right towards (6,7). But I need to make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apple without getting blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (4,1) first because it's directly below me, and I can get it in five moves, but I can also consider the other apples.\n\nWait, another apple is at (3,1), which is to the left and down. From (4,6), moving left once to (3,6), then down five times to (3,1). That's six moves. So, longer than going to (6,7).\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,7), requiring three moves. So, I should aim for that.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,3) is also in the middle. From (4,6), moving right once to (5,6), then down three times to (5,3). That's four moves. So, that's closer than (6,7), which is three moves. Wait, no, (6,7) is three moves, (5,3) is four moves. So, (6,7) is still closer.\n\nWait, no, from (4,6) to (5,3): right once to (5,6), then down three times to (5,3). That's four moves. So, (6,7) is three moves, which is better.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to go towards (6,7). So, my first move should be to the right, taking me to (5,6).\n\nBut wait, I should also check if moving right is safe. Are there any obstacles? The enemy is at (0,9), so no. My body is empty, so no collision risk. So, moving right is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the other apples. For example, the apple at (8,1) is far to the right and down. That would take a lot of moves, so probably not worth it right now.\n\nSo, the plan is to move right towards (6,7). So, next move: RIGHT.\n</think>\n\nTo maximize points quickly, I'll move towards the closest apple at (6,7). Moving right from (4,6) to (5,6) is the first step.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"
