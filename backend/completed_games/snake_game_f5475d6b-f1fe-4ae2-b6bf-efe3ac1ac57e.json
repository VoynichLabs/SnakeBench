Wait, the initial apples were listed, and I've collected 2. Let me check the apples at: (3,3), (0,2), (1,9), (0,6), (7,5). Since I have 2 apples, maybe two of those are already eaten. But the problem doesn't specify which ones, so I need to focus on the remaining ones.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,5) with no body. So they're a single-segment snake. They might move in a direction that could collide with me or each other.\n\nFrom the board state text, let me visualize it. Coordinates are from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). The board shows:\n\nRow 9 (top): . A . ... etc.\nRow 8: all .\nRow 7: .\nRow 6: A . . T . ... (T might be a trap or something? Or maybe a typo for 'A'? Wait, the apples are at (3,3), (0,2) which is row 2, column 0? Wait, coordinates are (X,Y), so (0,2) is x=0, y=2. The board is displayed with rows from 9 down to 0. So row 2 is third from the bottom. Let me parse the board:\n\nLine 9: \"9 . A . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 so at (3,9)? Wait, no. Wait, the board is printed with Y from 9 (top) to 0 (bottom). Each line is a Y level. So the first line is Y=9, then Y=8, etc., down to Y=0.\n\nLooking at line 6: \"6 A . . . T . . . . .\". So at Y=6, X=0 is 'A' (apple at (0,6) which is listed), then X=4 is T. Maybe T is a trap or something else? Or perhaps a typo. Not sure. Maybe ignore T.\n\nLine 5: \"5 . . 0 . T 1 . A . .\". Here, X=2 is '0' (maybe the tail of my snake? Wait, my snake's body is (4,5) and (4,6). So (4,5) is Y=5, X=4. The snake's head is (5,5). So in line 5 (Y=5), the cells at X=2 is '0' which might be part of the snake's body? Or maybe it's a typo. Not sure. Maybe the '0' is part of the initial layout but not relevant now.\n\nLine 3: \"3 . . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 Y=3, X=4 is 'A' (apple at (4,3) which is listed in the apples). So that's one of the apples.\n\nMy current position is (5,5). The apples remaining would be (3,3), (0,2), (1,9), (0,6), (7,5) unless I've eaten some. Since I have 2 apples, maybe two are left. But I need to aim for any remaining.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,5). They could move in any direction. If I move towards (7,5), which is an apple, that's a possible target. But I need to check if moving there is safe.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each direction for safety:\n\n- UP: from (5,5) to (5,6). My body includes (4,6). So moving to (5,6) is adjacent to my existing body? Wait, the body is [(4,5), (4,6)]. So the next position would be (5,6). Is that colliding with any snake's body? My own body is (4,6), so (5,6) is adjacent but not overlapping. The enemy is at (2,5). So moving UP to (5,6) is safe? Unless the enemy moves into that cell. But since all snakes move simultaneously, I need to consider possible collisions.\n\nWait, the rules say that if my head moves into any snake's body, including other snakes, I die. So after moving, my head's new position must not be on any snake's body (including enemy's) or head.\n\nAt this turn, the enemy's head is at (2,5). They will move in some direction. But I don't know their intended move. So I have to assume that they might move in any direction. So I need to avoid positions that the enemy could move into, but since I can't predict their move, maybe the safest approach is to avoid their current position and possible adjacent cells.\n\nBut since the enemy's movement is unknown, perhaps the best is to avoid their current position and possible directions. However, since I can't predict, maybe focus on my own safety first.\n\nSo for each possible move:\n\n1. UP: (5,6). Check if that's off the board? No, Y=6 is within 0-9. Check if it's in my own body. My current body is (4,5) and (4,6). So (5,6) is not in my body. But after moving, the new body would be (5,6) as head, then (5,5) (previous head), then (4,5), (4,6). Wait, no. When the snake moves, the entire body shifts. So moving UP would make the new head at (5,6), and the body would be (5,5), (4,5), (4,6). So the new position (5,6) is safe unless another snake's head or body is there. The enemy is at (2,5) now. If they move to (5,6), then we collide. But since we can't know their move, maybe it's risky. But maybe possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards me. So UP is possible.\n\n2. DOWN: (5,4). Check if that's safe. My current body is (4,5) and (4,6). (5,4) is not in my body. But need to check if it's in enemy's body. Enemy has no body. So safe? Unless enemy moves there. Again, can't be sure.\n\n3. LEFT: (4,5). But that's my current body part. Wait, my current head is (5,5). If I move LEFT to (4,5), that's the position of my first body segment. That would be moving into my own body, which is a death. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n4. RIGHT: (6,5). Check if that's safe. Not in my body. The apple at (7,5) is to the right, but (6,5) is adjacent. So moving RIGHT would take me to (6,5). Is that occupied by any snake? Enemy is at (2,5). So (6,5) is free. So RIGHT is a possible move. Also, (7,5) is an apple. So moving RIGHT could lead towards that apple.\n\nNow, eliminate invalid moves. LEFT is invalid because moving into my own body. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, among these, which is best?\n\nThe goal is to collect apples and survive. The apple at (7,5) is directly to the right. If I move RIGHT to (6,5), next turn I could move RIGHT again to (7,5) to get the apple. But need to check if that's possible.\n\nBut first, check if moving RIGHT is safe. Also, considering the enemy's possible moves. If enemy moves towards me, could there be a collision?\n\nEnemy is at (2,5). If they move RIGHT, they go to (3,5). If I move RIGHT to (6,5), no collision. If they move LEFT, they go to (1,5). If they move UP or DOWN, their position changes. So moving RIGHT seems safe in terms of enemy collision.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,6) might be safer if the enemy is moving down, but not sure.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT to (6,5), next turn I can move RIGHT again to (7,5) to get the apple. But need to make sure that in the next turn, that position is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP could lead towards (1,9) apple, but that's a longer path.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (2,5), maybe they are a threat if I stay in the same row. For example, if I move RIGHT, and the enemy moves LEFT towards my path, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP could take me away from the enemy's possible path.\n\nBut since I can't predict the enemy's move, the safest is to choose a direction that doesn't immediately put me in danger and allows me to collect apples.\n\nThe apple at (7,5) is directly to the right. So moving RIGHT now would get me closer. If I can reach (7,5) next turn, that's a good apple. So moving RIGHT now to (6,5), then next turn move RIGHT to (7,5). But need to check if that path is safe.\n\nBut in the current turn, moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe because the enemy is at (2,5), and unless they move into (6,5), which is unlikely in one turn. The distance is 4 units in X. So enemy can't reach (6,5) in one move. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo between UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Which is better?\n\nUP would take me to (5,6). From there, next moves could be towards (1,9) apple, but that's a longer path. Alternatively, maybe the apples at (0,6) or (3,3).\n\nAlternatively, DOWN to (5,4). Not sure if that's useful. Maybe towards (0,2) apple? But that's a long way.\n\nAlternatively, RIGHT towards (7,5) apple. That seems more immediate.\n\nBut also, need to avoid being trapped. Let's see.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,5), then next move could be RIGHT again to (7,5) to get the apple. Then, after that, maybe move UP or other directions.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP now could allow me to go towards (1,9) apple. But that's a Y distance of 3 (from 5 to 9). So three moves upward. But need to check if that's possible without collisions.\n\nBut considering that the enemy is at (2,5), if they move UP, they could be at (2,6), which is near my UP direction. If I move UP to (5,6), and the enemy moves right three times, but that's multiple turns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now gives me a direct path to an apple. So maybe that's better.\n\nBut also, need to consider that after collecting the apple at (7,5), I would grow, which could make my body longer. But since I have 2 apples, I can afford to grow.\n\nAnother thing: the move RIGHT is adjacent to the apple at (7,5). So moving there now would set me up to get the apple next turn.\n\nSo the best option seems to be RIGHT. Let me confirm.\n\nCheck if moving RIGHT is safe. The new head would be (6,5). The enemy's current position is (2,5). They could move in any direction. If they move RIGHT to (3,5), that's still far from (6,5). So no collision. If they move LEFT, they go to (1,5). So no collision. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo the possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Among these, RIGHT is the best because it leads towards an apple and is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is better. Let's see. If I move UP to (5,6), then next turn I could move UP again towards (1,9). But that's a long way. However, (5,6) is adjacent to my current body (4,6). Wait, my body after moving UP would be (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6). So no collision in the next steps.\n\nBut the enemy is at (2,5). If they move towards me, but again, can't predict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4). Then maybe towards (0,2) apple. But that's a long way.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT to get closer to the (7,5) apple. So the answer should be RIGHT.\nRIGHT",
