However, this move would require me to zigzag to reach the apple, which might expose me to more risk from other enemies or my own tail.\n\nIf I move right, I would be moving towards the apple at (5, 8), but I would also be moving closer to enemy snake #1.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will choose to move left (to (3, 8)) to try to collect the apple at (3, 0) and avoid enemy snake #1.

Since we can't move diagonally, we'll continue moving left for now.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving left, we should reassess the board and decide when to move up towards the apple at (4, 7). We should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement and be prepared to change direction if necessary.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
