Need to grow.\n*   **Snake #0:** Head at (4, 5). Needs to grow.\n\n**Board:** The board is relatively open. There are apples at (9, 1), (6, 1), (2, 7), (7, 2), and (4, 0).  Snake #0 is relatively close to the apples at (9, 1) and (6, 1).\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n\n*   **UP:** Head moves to (3, 9).  I'm closer to the apple at (4, 0), but the edge of the board is close.\n*   **DOWN:** Head moves to (5, 9).  I\u2019m closer to the apple at (4, 0).\n*   **LEFT:** Head moves to (3, 9). I\u2019m closer to the apple at (2, 7).\n*   **RIGHT:** Head moves to (5, 9). I\u2019m closer to the apple at (4, 0).\n\n**Analysis & Decision:**\n\nI need to prioritize getting closer to apples without immediate danger. The apple at (4, 0) is relatively close. All the options leads to it. I should stick with that.\n\nI will choose right to slowly move closer to the apple at (4,0). Since the snake #0 has its head at (4,5) if I stay at (4,9), it will be very risky. I choose to move to the right and try to stay alive.\n\nThe snake #0 will move from (4,5) to (4,6).\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nI need to maintain a safe distance from Snake #0 while focusing on collecting apples around the (4,0) coordinate. I will continue to move right, attempting to grow steadily and avoid getting trapped, while making sure I don't collide with Snake #0.\n\nUP",

It also nudges you toward the upper apple cluster if you follow with further planning.\n\nPlan:\n- Start by moving UP to maintain mobility, then consider heading toward the apple at (2,7) with a sequence that stays flexible: e.g., UP, LEFT, LEFT, UP, while monitoring the enemy and avoiding dead-ends.\n\nUP",
