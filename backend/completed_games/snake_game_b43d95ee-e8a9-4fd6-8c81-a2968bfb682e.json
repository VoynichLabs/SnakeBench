Nope!  \n\n\ud83e\udd14 **Future\u2011proof check**  \nIf we go LEFT we land on (6,5). Our new body will be [(7,5),(8,5),(9,5)], leaving us with THREE safe exits next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT. That\u2019s maximum flexibility! Going DOWN also gives three exits but moves us away from the apple zones and doesn\u2019t pressure the opponent. UP narrows us down to only two safe exits, which is risky in a tight board.  \n\n\ud83c\udf4e **Apple hunt & score race**  \nWe\u2019re currently behind 3\u20114 in apples. Grabbing an apple now would be nice, but none sit on (7,5), (8,4), or (8,6). Moving LEFT puts us on a trajectory toward (5,5) and (2,6) \u2013 perfect spots to fuel a comeback while we keep the board open.  \n\n\ud83d\udc40 **Enemy vibe**  \nSnake #1 is stuck around (2,3). Moving LEFT doesn\u2019t engage them now, but it sets us up to swing leftward and eventually force a head\u2011on collision when we have the higher score. Imagine luring them into a narrow lane near (2,6) \u2013 pure domination!  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **SHORT\u2011TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**  \n- Keep at least three open exits at all times.  \n- Prioritize moving leftward toward (5,5) and (2,6) to collect apples and pressure #1.  \n- Watch #1\u2019s next move; if they bite an apple and we can cut them off near (2,6), trap them.  \n- Avoid straight\u2011line dead\u2011ends; favour loops that preserve UP/DOWN/LEFT flexibility.  \n\nWhich direction gives us the most room to manoeuvre while staying alive?  \n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s tempting for a future head\u2011on, but we\u2019re still behind in apples (4 vs 7) and moving into that tight corridor could trap us if the opponent stays put.\n- **DOWN** simply drifts away from any fruit and shrinks our future exits \u2013 not the aggressive growth we want.\n- **RIGHT** is dead\u2011on suicide; it would slam us into our own body segment at (5,5).\n- **UP** lands us at (4,6), right next to the delicious apple at (4,7). One more step up and we\u2019ll instantly grow, overtaking the score lead. Plus, from (4,6) we still have three viable exits (up to the apple, left to (3,6), right to (5,6)) \u2013 plenty of flexibility.\n\n\ud83e\udded Quick strategy note:  \nGrab the (4,7) apple on the next turn, then evaluate whether to swing left toward the cluster of low\u2011x apples or circle around to cut across the board and force a collision when our apple count eclipses the enemy\u2019s. Keep the path open, avoid the opponent\u2019s vertical wall, and let our length dominate.\n\nUP",

He\u2019s got 7 apples; we\u2019re sitting at 9. We\u2019re ahead, and we want the boxing plan to seal the win.\n\nSAFE MOVES (no suicide this turn):\n- LEFT to (5,8) \u2014 safe, keeps us clear of both bodies.\n- RIGHT to (7,8) \u2014 safe, puts pressure on him and starts hemming him in.\n\nUP would slam into our neck at (6,9). DOWN would collide with his body at (6,7) this turn (no bueno).\n\nWHY I PICK RIGHT (press the advantage):\n- It grabs space on his left flank and threatens a near-box, without stepping into his current space or ours.\n- It keeps both escape lanes for him (to (8,9) or (9,8)) open for now, so we\u2019re not doing a reckless trap that backfires.\n- It preserves a lot of future mobility for us as we grow our lead and chase apples later.\n\nTwo clear follow-ups after this turn:\n- If he runs to (9,8) or (8,9), we can thread toward the box angle and tighten the corridor on his tail, forcing him toward the wall and into a potential head-on if he keeps chasing.\n- If he hesitates or darts into a risky cross, we ride the moment to extend the box and aim for an advantageous apple net to extend our lead.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (7,8) this turn to apply pressure and keep both lanes open for ourselves.\n\nLong-term plan (toward the late game):\n- Build a locking pattern along the top-right quadrant, forcing him into tighter corridors and creating a potential head-on advantage since we\u2019re currently ahead on apples.\n\nPredicted reactions and how I\u2019ll adapt:\n- He\u2019ll likely choose (9,8) or (8,9) to avoid being boxed in too soon. I\u2019ll mirror the pressure to close the gap without risking a suicide move, then tilt toward the wall when the space narrows to force a decisive collision path if we\u2019re still ahead on apples.\n\nBest move (target for this turn): RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

There\u2019s an apple at (7,9), so we can grow.\n  - RIGHT to (8,8) \u2014 CLEARLY HAZARD. This cell is currently part of Snake #0\u2019s body. Moving there would be suicide this turn.\n  - LEFT to (6,8) \u2014 HITTING YOUR OWN NECK. DEAD.\n  - DOWN to (7,7) \u2014 HITTING Snake #0\u2019s body. DEAD.\n- RISK FACTOR: If Snake #0 also heads LEFT from (8,9) to (7,9), we\u2019d have a head-on in that apple square. That\u2019s a potential double KO, but RIGHT is not safe (it\u2019s their body now). UP remains the only safe option on this turn.\n\nWHY UP IS THE BEST CONTEXT-ADJUSTED MOVE:\n- It\u2019s the only immediate safe move that keeps us alive without courting a guaranteed death.\n- It lets us eat the apple at (7,9), pushing our lead to 10 apples vs their 7 and further pressuring him to react.\n- It preserves space to maneuver\u2014no immediate trap, and we can pivot toward wallboxing later if he\u2019s boxed in or tries to chase apples.\n\nCHESS-LIKE FOLLOW-UPS (if he moves):\n- If he retreats along the top edge (to (9,9) or (8,9)\u2019s vicinity), we keep pressure and look to tighten the corridor from above and right.\n- If he tries a quick run into (7,9) himself, we\u2019ll have to adapt on the fly; a head-on would be a high-risk exchange, and we\u2019re still ahead on apples.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Take the apple on (7,9) by moving UP now; extend our length to 10 and keep the momentum.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\n- Build a controlled top-right box to force him into the wall or into a head-on scenario where our apple lead decides the result.\n\nBest move (this turn): UP\n\nUP",
