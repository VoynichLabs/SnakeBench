No other enemy parts are listed.\n\n- The immediate threat is moving left into (3,9) where the enemy snake's head is, which is unsafe.\n\n- Moving downward toward (4,8) (the apple) seems promising since there are no immediate obstacles in that direction, and it would cause us to grow.\n\n- Moving right would go toward the top right area, but there are no nearby apples or threats, and that might be riskier.\n\n- Moving up would go outside the board (since current position y=9 is top edge), which is invalid.\n\n- Moving down to (4,8) is the best option for collecting the closest apple.\n\n- Next steps after moving down: continued movement toward other apples can be planned, but initially, let's go downward.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- Moving down to (4,8): safe, since it is free and contains an apple.\n- Our last move was 'None', so making a direct move down is acceptable.\n\nStrategy:\n- Prioritize apples that are close and accessible.\n- Avoid moving into the opponent snake's position or walls.\n- Since the snake is currently only at (4,9), moving down is safe.\n\nConclusion:\n- Next move: DOWN\n\n**Final decision: DOWN**"
