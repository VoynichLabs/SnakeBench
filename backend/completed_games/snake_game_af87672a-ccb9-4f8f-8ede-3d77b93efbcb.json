The enemy snake is still relatively far from me, and I have several options for apple locations, but I'll prioritize getting closer to those that are northwest, as they seem more readily available.\n\nHeading up will bring me directly towards the wall, though. I should maintain enough distance so I can still move down if needed to reach those left-side apples. Moving left brings me even farther away from my optimal apple targets.\n\nConsidering all this, my next best move is... RIGHT!\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I get to a decent horizontal distance and stand-by in that lane, I might be able to spot the enemy's movement pattern or any potential vaccinations. Then I can decide my optimal next two moves based on that information.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT",

I need to consider other options, like moving RIGHT to (1, 8) or moving UP to (2, 8) to receive more information about the board.\n\nBut for now, I think moving LEFT to (0, 8) is my best bet. I just need to make sure that I'm not moving directly into another enemy object, like the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nMy next move will be to assess the situation and adjust my strategy if needed. For now, though, I think moving LEFT is the right choice. \n\nNext move: LEFT.",
