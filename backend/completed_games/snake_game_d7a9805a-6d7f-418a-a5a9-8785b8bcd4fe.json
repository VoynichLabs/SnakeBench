After this move, my head will be at (5,9) with body extending down to (5,2).

While it puts me at the top edge, I can immediately turn LEFT next move to (4,9)\n3. This creates distance from the enemy snake\n4. Positions me well for future moves toward the (2,8) apple\n5. The score increase helps close the gap with the enemy\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Collect (5,9) apple this turn\n- Next turn, move LEFT to (4,9) to avoid being trapped at the top\n- Then work toward the (2,8) apple\n- Monitor enemy movement to avoid head-on collisions\n- After collecting left-side apples, move toward right-side apples\n- Try to maintain at least 2 escape routes at all times\n- Be prepared to create barriers if enemy moves aggressively\n- Aim to reach apple parity with the enemy\n\nUP",
