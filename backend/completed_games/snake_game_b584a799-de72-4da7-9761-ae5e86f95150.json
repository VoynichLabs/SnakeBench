No chance of a head\u2011on this turn.  \n\n### Scan the four directions\n\n| Direction | Target cell | Occupied? | Apple? | Immediate safety |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------|------------------|\n| **UP**    | (8,\u202f2)      | empty     | no     | safe \u2705 |\n| **DOWN**  | (8,\u202f0)      | empty **+** apple! | yes | safe \u2705 |\n| **LEFT**  | (7,\u202f1)      | empty     | no     | safe \u2705 |\n| **RIGHT** | (9,\u202f1)      | **my own body** \u2192 dead | \u2013 | \u274c |\n\nSo we have three viable moves:\u202fUP,\u202fDOWN,\u202fLEFT.  \n\n### What\u2019s the best play?\n\n- **DOWN** grabs the juicy apple at (8,\u202f0) **right now** (+1 point, +1 length). After eating, we\u2019ll sit at the bottom edge with two solid escape routes: LEFT toward the apple line (7,0 \u2192 6,0 \u2192 4,0) or RIGHT into column\u202f9 for a quick climb later. No risk of stepping into our own tail because the cell we\u2019d retreat to (8,1) becomes part of the body.\n\n- **LEFT** keeps us alive and opens three exits next turn, but it **wastes a turn** while the opponent is already ahead (6\u202fvs\u202f4 apples).  \n\n- **UP** is safe but pushes us into a tighter corridor (only LEFT or UP next turn) and still skips the free apple below us.\n\nGiven the scoreboard, we need to **close the gap fast** and start growing a wall on the bottom\u2011right side to block any low\u2011right swing the rival might attempt later. The apple at (8,\u202f0) is a perfect bite to start that.\n\n### Short\u2011term game plan\n1. **DOWN** now \u2013 grab (8,\u202f0).  \n2. Next turn head LEFT to (7,\u202f0) for another apple, then keep sliding left along the bottom row, snatching (6,0), (4,0) as we go.  \n3. Use the right\u2011wall \u201chug\u201d as a fallback corridor if the opponent tries to cut us off high up.  \n\nLet\u2019s lock it in and start the feast!  \n\nDOWN",

He can\u2019t reach me this turn.  \n\n**\ud83c\udf4e Apple Hotspots**\n\n- Directly to my right is an apple at **(1,\u202f2)**.  \n- Below me at (0,\u202f1) is empty, but the next step (1,\u202f1) also holds an apple.  \n- A whole cluster sits on row\u202f2: (2,\u202f2), (3,\u202f2) and (5,\u202f2). Getting into that lane now gives me a fast\u2011track to the low\u2011row bounty.\n\n**\ud83d\udea7 Immediate safety**\n\n| Direction | Target | Content | Verdict |\n|-----------|--------|---------|---------|\n| **UP**    | (0,\u202f3) | My own body (segment right behind) | \u274c illegal |\n| **DOWN**  | (0,\u202f1) | Empty | \u2705 safe |\n| **LEFT**  | (\u20111,\u202f2) | Off\u2011board | \u274c illegal |\n| **RIGHT** | (1,\u202f2) | **Apple** | \u2705 safe & growth |\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT keep me alive, but **RIGHT** gives an immediate apple (+1\u202fpoint) and drops me into the rich \u201crow\u20112\u201d apple corridor while staying far from the opponent\u2019s tunnel.\n\n**\ud83d\udd2e Short\u2011term plan (next\u202f\u2248\u202f5\u20118 turns)**  \n\n1. **RIGHT** to (1,\u202f2) and eat the apple \u2192 grow to 25 segments, score 24.  \n2. Next turn **RIGHT** again to (2,\u202f2) (another apple).  \n3. Keep sliding right along row\u202f2, scooping up (3,\u202f2) and (5,\u202f2) while the opponent is still battling his vertical column.  \n4. Once the bottom\u2011row apples are cleared, swing down to the bottom edge, then sweep left\u2011to\u2011right to seal off any escape routes the opponent might try.  \n\nBy locking the opponent in his own maze while we gobble the low\u2011row apples, we expand our lead and preserve plenty of open space for future maneuvers.\n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Why not DOWN now?**  \nGoing down only buys a single empty step; we\u2019d still need extra moves to reach the apple cluster. Taking the apple right away boosts our score and gives us a richer set of options right away.\n\n**\u2705 Decision** \u2013 grab the apple and head into the apple\u2011rich corridor.\n\nRIGHT",
