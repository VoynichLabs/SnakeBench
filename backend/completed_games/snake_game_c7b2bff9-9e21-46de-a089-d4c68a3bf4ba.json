My body is now [(4, 6)].\nApples are at: (2, 6), (9, 3), (2, 8), (0, 3), (1, 4). (Note: The apple at (4, 7) was consumed and removed from the list reported in the new state, and the apple at (1, 4) is new or previously unseen).\nScore: 2 apples.\nEnemy Snake 0 is at (3, 0). (It moved LEFT from (4, 0) in the visualization of Turn 1, but the provided state says its head is (3, 0). I must use the current state data.)\n\n**My details:**\nHead: (4, 7)\nBody: [(4, 6)]\nTail: (4, 6)\nLength: 2\n\n**Enemy details:**\nSnake #0 Head: (3, 0)\nBody: none\nLength: 1\n\n**Available Apples:**\nA1: (2, 6) - 3 steps away (2 L, 1 D)\nA2: (2, 8) - 3 steps away (2 L, 1 U)\nA3: (9, 3) - Far\nA4: (0, 3) - Far\nA5: (1, 4) - Medium distance\n\n**Step 1: Identify Safe Moves from (4, 7)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 8):** Safe. Moves towards A2 (2, 8). Manhattan distance to A2 R(4, 8) = |4-2| + |8-8| = 2.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 6):** **DANGER!** This is my body segment (the cell the tail *will* occupy if I move away, but currently the tail is still connected here). Since my length is 2, moving DOWN moves onto my segment at (4, 6). If I move and grow, the old body (4, 6) remains, but since I am not growing this turn (no apple at 4, 6), the tail usually moves out of (4, 6). However, the rule is: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" (4, 6) is currently my *body*. I should avoid moving directly onto my body. This move is currently lethal because it's moving back onto my only body segment.\n    *Self-Correction*: Wait, my body segments are the *non-head* parts of the snake. The list is Head: (4, 7), Body: [(4, 6)]. Moving to (4, 6) means colliding with my own body. **Thus, DOWN is deadly.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 7):** Safe. Moves towards A1 (2, 6) and A2 (2, 8).\n    *   To A1 (2, 6) R(3, 7) = |3-2| + |7-6| = 2.\n    *   To A2 (2, 8) R(3, 7) = |3-2| + |7-8| = 2.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 7):** Safe. Moves away from nearby apples.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT)**\n\nI need to decide between UP (4, 8) and LEFT (3, 7). Both keep me approximately equidistant (2 steps) from the two closest apples, (2, 6) and (2, 8).\n\n*   If I go UP (4, 8): I am 2 steps from (2, 8) (2 L) and 4 steps from (2, 6) (2 L, 2 D).\n*   If I go LEFT (3, 7): I am 2 steps from (2, 8) (1 L, 1 U) and 2 steps from (2, 6) (1 L, 1 D).\n\nGoing LEFT keeps A1 and A2 equally accessible, allowing for flexibility. It places me centrally between them on the Y axis.\n\nLet's look at the subsequent move potential from (3, 7):\nFrom (3, 7):\n*   To get A2 (2, 8), I would need U then L, OR L then U.\n*   To get A1 (2, 6), I would need D then L, OR L then D.\n\nLet's look at the subsequent move potential from (4, 8):\nFrom (4, 8):\n*   To get A2 (2, 8), I would need L, L. (2 steps)\n*   To get A1 (2, 6), I would need D, D, L, L. (4 steps)\n\nMoving UP commits me more strongly to the (2, 8) path, whereas moving LEFT keeps both open. Since both apples are very close, maximizing options is usually good, but minimizing turns is better.\n\nTargeting (2, 8) via UP:\nT2: (4, 8) [Move: UP]\nT3: (3, 8) [Move: LEFT] - This forces a potential collision if Snake 0 manages to reach (3, 8) fast, which is unlikely as enemy is at (3, 0).\nT4: (2, 8) [Move: LEFT] - Apple consumed. Total 3 turns.\n\nTargeting (2, 8) via LEFT:\nT2: (3, 7) [Move: LEFT]\nT3: (3, 8) OR (2, 7) [Move: UP or LEFT]\nIf T3 = (3, 8) [U], T4 = (2, 8) [L]. Total 3 turns.\nIf T3 = (2, 7) [L], T4 = (2, 8) [U]. Total 3 turns.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT lead to A2 in 3 turns.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 8), my body is (4, 7).\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 7), my body is (4, 7).\n\nThe difference is minor. (4, 8) is slightly more defensive since it moves along the border, limiting collision points somewhat, and sets up a clear 2-step path (L, L) to the apple (2, 8).\n\nLet's check A1 (2, 6):\nFrom (4, 7):\nVia LEFT: (3, 7) -> (3, 6) [D] -> (2, 6) [L]. (3 turns)\n(or 3, 7 -> 2, 7 -> 2, 6) (3 turns)\nVia UP: (4, 8) -> (3, 8) -> D -> (3, 7) -> D -> (3, 6) -> L (too long)\n\nSince A2 (2, 8) is a high-y coordinate apple, moving UP seems slightly more intuitive for securing headroom. Both moves are equally efficient for getting an apple in 3 total turns.\n\nI will choose UP to move towards (2, 8) and secure the immediate vicinity on the top edge.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:** Secure (2, 8) next turn, then target (2, 6) or (1, 4). The enemy snake 0 is far away and should not interfere with these local apples.\n\nUP",

Snake #0 has moved UP from (0, 1) last turn. It is clearly targeting the low-X apples: (0, 3), (1, 4), or (0, 1).\n\n**Objective:**\nContinue collecting apples. I am in a good central position. The remaining apples are split: three on the left side (0, 3), (1, 4), (0, 1) and two on the right side (9, 3), (9, 5).\n\n**Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance):**\n1. (0, 3): |2-0| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n2. (1, 4): |2-1| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\n3. (0, 1): |2-0| + |6-1| = 2 + 5 = 7\n4. (9, 3): |2-9| + |6-3| = 7 + 3 = 10\n5. (9, 5): |2-9| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8 (Closest on the right)\n\nThe closest overall target is **(1, 4)** (distance 3). This apple is contested by Snake #0.\nSnake #0 is at (0, 2).\nDistance from #0 to (1, 4): |0-1| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3 moves (e.g., R, U, U).\nDistance from #0 to (0, 3): |0-0| + |2-3| = 0 + 1 = 1 move (U).\nDistance from #0 to (0, 1): |0-0| + |2-1| = 0 + 1 = 1 move (D).\n\nSnake #0 will almost certainly move to (0, 3) or (0, 1) this turn. (0, 3) is a higher-value target. Let's assume Snake #0 moves UP to (0, 3) and eats it.\n\nIf I move toward (1, 4), I need 3 moves (e.g., L to (1, 6), D to (1, 5), D to (1, 4)). Since Snake #0 requires 3 moves to get there, I should prioritize this apple if possible, especially since it's the closest to me overall.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Safe Moves from (2, 6)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 7):** **DANGER!** This is my body segment. Lethal collision.\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 5):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 6):** Safe. Moves toward (1, 4).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 6):** Safe. Moves away from (1, 4) but towards the right side if needed.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)**\n\n*   **Move LEFT (to 1, 6):** Moves one step closer to (1, 4) (new distance 1+4=5, wait, distance to (1, 4) is 1+2=3. If I move L to (1, 6), new distance is |1-1| + |6-4| = 2). This is a strong targeting move.\n\n*   **Move DOWN (to 2, 5):** New distance to (1, 4) is |2-1| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2. This is also a strong targeting move, arriving at the same time as LEFT, but keeps me slightly more central.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 3, 6):** New distance to (9, 5) is |3-9| + |6-5| = 6 + 1 = 7. If Snake #0 takes all the left apples, this is my backup plan.\n\nComparing LEFT vs DOWN for apple (1, 4):\n*   LEFT (to 1, 6): Next moves could be D, D. Path: (2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4).\n*   DOWN (to 2, 5): Next moves could be L, D. Path: (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4).\n\nBoth paths take 3 turns to reach (1, 4), resulting in arrival at Turn 8.\n\n**Contest with Snake #0:**\nSnake #0 is at (0, 2).\nIf #0 moves U to (0, 3) (eats apple). Turn 7: #0 is at (0, 3).\nIf #0 aims for (1, 4) from (0, 3):\nTurn 7: U (0, 3) **(Eats apple)**\nTurn 8: R (1, 3)\nTurn 9: U (1, 4) **(Eats apple, if available)**\n\nIf Apple (0, 3) is taken by #0 on T6, then (1, 4) is the closest available apple to #0 (distance 2 from (0, 3) to (1, 4)). #0 will get there on Turn 8 (R, U).\n\nWait, I miscalculated the distance for Snake #0 to (1, 4) from (0, 2):\n(0, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4). 3 moves. (Arrives T9 if starting immediately)\n(0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4). 3 moves. (Arrives T9 if starting immediately)\n\nHowever, if Snake #0 eats (0, 3) on T6 by moving UP, its head is at (0, 3) on T6.\nIf Snake #0 then targets (1, 4):\nT7: R -> (1, 3)\nT8: U -> (1, 4). Snake #0 arrives at T8.\n\nMy paths arrive at T8 regardless of whether I choose LEFT or DOWN now.\nMy path:\nT6: L to (1, 6) OR D to (2, 5)\nT7: D to (1, 5) OR L to (1, 5)\nT8: D to (1, 4)\n\nSince we are both arriving at (1, 4) on Turn 8, a head-on collision is unlikely, but Snake #0 might get there first depending on tie-breakers or if I am forced to move slower. Since I have a body, I must also consider self-collision.\n\nLet's look at the movement options for the next two turns if Snake #0 takes (0, 3).\n\n**Option A: Go LEFT (to 1, 6)**\nT6: (1, 6). Body [(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)]\nT7: DOWN (to 1, 5). Body [(1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]\nT8: DOWN (to 1, 4, apple). **Arrival T8.** Safe path.\n\n**Option B: Go DOWN (to 2, 5)**\nT6: (2, 5).

Moving LEFT takes me immediately closer to the X=1 column where the apple is located, which feels strategically slightly better for committing to the left side.\n\n**Secondary consideration: Obstacles and Traps**\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 6), I am still wide open.\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 5), I am still wide open.\n\nLet's confirm the likely move for Snake #0 at (0, 2). (0, 3) is a free apple one UP move away. (0, 1) is a free apple one DOWN move away. Given the context of seeking apples, UP to (0, 3) is very likely. If Snake #0 moves UP, it will eat the apple at (0, 3) and be length 2 with head at (0, 3).\n\nAssuming #0 goes UP to (0, 3) (T6).\nIf I choose LEFT to (1, 6) (T6). I am safe from #0, as it is four squares away.\n\nThis seems like the best immediate move: commit to the left side and aim for the second closest apple (1, 4).\n\nMove: LEFT\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nTurn 6 (Current): Move LEFT to (1, 6) aiming for apple (1, 4). Assume Snake #0 takes (0, 3).\nTurn 7: Move DOWN to (1, 5).\nTurn 8: Move DOWN to (1, 4) to eat the apple.\nAfter T8, if (0, 1) is still available, target it, otherwise assess the right side apples (9, 5) and (9, 3).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nLEFT",

I did not eat an apple, so my length remains 4.\nHead: (1, 6)\nBody: [(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)]\n\nSnake #0, which was at (0, 2), moved UP to (0, 3) and ate the apple there (confirming my assumption from the prior turn's rationale). Snake #0's new length is 2.\nHead #0: (0, 3)\nBody #0: [(0, 2)]\n\n**Apples remaining:** (9, 3), (1, 4), (9, 5), (0, 1), (7, 2). Total 5 apples remaining.\n\n**My objective:** Continue pursuit of (1, 4).\n\n**Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance from (1, 6)):**\n1. (1, 4): |1-1| + |6-4| = 2 (Target)\n2. (0, 1): |1-0| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n3. (7, 2): |1-7| + |6-2| = 6 + 4 = 10\n4. (9, 5): |1-9| + |6-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n5. (9, 3): |1-9| + |6-3| = 8 + 3 = 11\n\n(1, 4) is by far the closest apple.\n\n**Contest Analysis for (1, 4):**\nMy current head: (1, 6). Distance to (1, 4) is 2 moves.\nPath: (1, 6) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4). Arrival Turn 9.\n\nSnake #0 head: (0, 3). Distance to (1, 4) is 2 moves.\nPath #0: (0, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4). Arrival Turn 9.\n\nSince both snakes are exactly 2 moves away and can reach the apple simultaneously on Turn 9, this is a head-to-head race. Since my coordinates are (1, 6) and my planned moves are DOWN, DOWN, and Snake #0's coordinates are (0, 3) and its planned moves are RIGHT, UP, there is no chance of a head-on collision before the apple. Since Snake #0 has a smaller ID (0 vs 1), it usually has prioritization in certain game systems, but without explicit tie-breaking rules, I assume movement is simultaneous. I must stick to the path and hope for the best, or pivot if a safer apple opens up. Given that I am already committed, I will continue.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Safe Moves from (1, 6)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 7):** Safe. Moves away from the target.\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, 5):** Safe. Moves toward (1, 4).\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 6):** Safe. Moves away from the target, closer to the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 6):** **DANGER!** This is the first segment of my body *[(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)]*. Lethal collision.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves**\n\n*   **Move DOWN (to 1, 5):** Pushes me 1 step closer to (1, 4). This is the continuation of the optimal 2-turn path.\n    * New head: (1, 5). Body segments shift: [(2, 6), (2, 7)]. Tail moves to (2, 7).\n    * Next turn (T8), the move will be DOWN to (1, 4) to eat the apple.\n\n*   **Move UP (to 1, 7):** Moves away from the target, increasing distance to 3. Not strategically sound unless avoiding a collision.\n\n*   **Move LEFT (to 0, 6):** Moves away from the target, increasing distance to 3. It also places me near Snake #0's location (0, 3), but far enough that it shouldn't cause trouble this turn.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 7:**\nThe highest priority is reaching (1, 4). Moving DOWN is the one and only move that advances this goal optimally. Since I am confident in my speed advantage (arriving simultaneously with Snake #0) and there is no direct collision risk along the path, I must choose DOWN.\n\n**Enemy Prediction Check (Snake #0 at (0, 3)):**\nSnake #0 is expected to move RIGHT to (1, 3) to continue its pursuit of (1, 4).\nIf #0 moves RIGHT: Head at (1, 3). Body at [(0, 3)]. Safe collision avoidance.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN (to 0, 2), it pivots to target (0, 1) (distance 1).\nIf Snake #0 moves UP (to 0, 4), it pivots away.\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT (into wall), it dies (unlikely).\n\nSince (1, 4) is closer than (0, 1) for Snake #0 from (0, 3) (distance 2 vs distance 3), the most logical move is RIGHT.\n\nMy move DOWN to (1, 5) and #0's move RIGHT to (1, 3) are completely safe this turn.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nTurn 7 (Current): Move DOWN to (1, 5) aiming for apple (1, 4). Assume Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (1, 3).\nTurn 8: Move DOWN to (1, 4) to eat the apple. Simultaneous arrival with Snake #0 at (1, 4) is expected. Priority rules will determine who eats it.\nIf I eat it: Turn 9, assess next closest apple (likely (0, 1) if not taken, or move towards the right side).\nIf #0 eats it: Turn 9, pivot immediately to target (0, 1) or move towards the right side (9, 5).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nDOWN",

Distance to (1, 4) is 1 move.\nPath: (1, 5) -> (1, 4). Arrival Turn 8.\n\nSnake #0 head: (1, 3). Distance to (1, 4) is 1 move.\nPath #0: (1, 3) -> (1, 4). Arrival Turn 8.\n\nWe are both 1 move away from (1, 4). Both snakes will attempt to move to (1, 4) this turn, resulting in a head-to-head collision at the apple location *if* both move DOWN (ID 1) and UP (ID 0).\n\n**Collision Rules:** Since both snake heads move into the same cell (1, 4) on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\n\nIf I move DOWN, and Snake #0 moves UP, we both die, resulting in a draw since the current apple score is 3 vs 1. I must avoid this scenario.\n\n**Alternative Targets for ID 1:**\nIf I choose not to move DOWN to (1, 4), I must find a safer option.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Safe Moves from (1, 5)**\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 6):** **DANGER!** This is the first segment of my body *[(1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]*. Lethal collision (moving backwards).\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, 4):** This is the collision point. If Snake #0 moves UP, I die.\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 5):** Safe. Moves away from the conflict.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 5):** Safe. Moves away from the conflict.\n\nSafe and non-lethal moves: LEFT, RIGHT. (Note: DOWN is lethal only if #0 chooses UP, but that is the most likely enemy move).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves, Considering Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 3))**\n\nSnake #0's most logical move is UP to (1, 4) to eat the apple.\n\n*   **If I Move DOWN (to 1, 4):** Simultaneous lethal collision. (AVOID)\n*   **If I Move LEFT (to 0, 5):**\n    * Distance to (0, 1): 4 moves.\n    * Distance to (9, 5): 9 moves.\n    * This move puts distance between me and Snake #0. (1, 3) to (0, 5) is non-colliding.\n*   **If I Move RIGHT (to 2, 5):**\n    * Distance to (9, 5): 7 moves.\n    * Distance to (7, 2): 6 moves. (Closer target than from (0, 5)).\n    * This move also puts distance between me and Snake #0. (1, 3) to (2, 5) is non-colliding.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nI must sacrifice the (1, 4) apple to avoid a mutual death, given that Snake #0 (ID 0) is equally close and highly motivated to move UP.\n\nComparing LEFT vs. RIGHT:\n1.  Moving RIGHT (to 2, 5) immediately opens up the path towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board: (9, 5) D=7, (9, 3) D=10, (7, 2) D=6.\n2.  Moving LEFT (to 0, 5) aims towards (0, 1) D=4, which is currently the closest non-contested apple.\n\nThe path to (0, 1) seems quicker (D=4 from (1, 5), D=3 from (0, 5) after the move) than the path to (7, 2) (D=9 from (1, 5), D=6 from (2, 5) after the move).\n\nLet's check contest for (0, 1).\nMy current distance from (1, 5) is 5.\nSnake #0 distance from (1, 3) is |1-0| + |3-1| = 3. Snake #0 could potentially reach (0, 1) in 3 moves: (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1). This is only 3 moves if it moved LEFT, DOWN, DOWN.\n\nHowever, Snake #0 is currently focused on (1, 4) (its optimal move is UP). If Snake #0 captures (1, 4), its new head is (1, 4). The new closest apple for #0 would be (0, 1), distance L=3.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 5) this turn (T8):\nDistance to (0, 1) is 4 moves: (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1). Arrival T12. This is too slow.\n\nLet's re-evaluate (0, 1) distance from (0, 5):\n(0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1). Yes, D=4.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 5) this turn (T8):\nThe closest right-side apple is (7, 2). D=6. (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> ... -> (7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 2). Arrival T14. This is also slow.\n\nThe choice is between moving to (0, 5) aiming for (0, 1), or moving to (2, 5) aiming for (7, 2) or (9, 5).\n\nSince Snake #0 is taking (1, 4), it will be longer (length 3, head at (1, 4)). Its next target will strongly be (0, 1) (distance 3) or (7, 2) (distance 7). Snake #0 is likely going for (0, 1).\n\nIf Snake #0 takes (1, 4) and moves towards (0, 1), I should pivot to the right side where competition is lower.\n\nMove RIGHT (to 2, 5) seems strategically safer as it puts me on a new path away from Snake #0's likely future path (down/left).\n\n**Refined Plan (Moving RIGHT to 2, 5):**\nTurn 8: Move RIGHT to (2, 5). Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 4) and eats the apple.\nI am now at (2, 5). Body is [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)].\nSnake #0 is at (1, 4). Body is [(1, 3), (0, 3)].\n\nNext targets from (2, 5):\n1. (9, 5): D=7. Path: 7 rights.\n2. (7, 2): D=6. Path: 5 right, 3 down.\n\nLet's target (7, 2) (D=6).\nT9: RIGHT to (3, 5)\nT10: RIGHT to (4, 5)\nT11: RIGHT to (5, 5)\nT12: RIGHT to (6, 5)\nT13: RIGHT to (7, 5)\nT14: DOWN to (7, 4)\nT15: DOWN to (7, 3)\nT16: DOWN to (7, 2) (Eat)\n\nI need to confirm if Snake #0 can interrupt this path or get to (7, 2) first.\n#0 at (1, 4), L=3. Target (0, 1) (D=3).\nIf #0 goes for (7, 2) (D=7): (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 2).\nIt is 1 right, 3 down, 6 right => D=1+3+6 = 10 moves if moving one axis at a time. Manhattan distance is 7.\nMy Manhattan distance is 6. I retain the lead for (7, 2).\n\nThe decision to move RIGHT is robust: it avoids immediate death and sets me up for the next closest, uncontested apple.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nTurn 8 (Current): Move RIGHT to (2, 5) to avoid lethal collision at (1, 4) and pivot towards the right side cluster of apples. Expect Snake #0 to eat the apple at (1, 4).\nTurn 9: Target (7, 2) (D=6). Move RIGHT towards (7, 2). Monitor Snake #0's movement towards (0, 1).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 appears to have moved UP and eaten the apple at (1, 4).\n\nHead (ID 1): (2, 5)\nBody (ID 1): [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)]\nLength: 4. Apples: 3.\n\nHead (ID 0): (1, 4) (This is conjectured based on the new snake #0 body length and position - its body is now [(1, 3)], meaning its previous head (1, 3) moved to (1, 4) and length increased. The current body list for #0 is [(1, 3)], which means its length is 2. The problem description states: Snake #0 - Head: (1, 2), Body: [(1, 3)], Apples: 1. Wait, this means the previous turn it was (1, 2), body (1, 3)? That body description is head (1, 2) is connected to (1, 3) which is illegal order (head-to-tail).\n\n**Re-reading Enemy Snake Data:**\n* Snake #0 - Head: (1, 2), Body: [(1, 3)], Apples: 1.\nIf the body list is head-to-tail, then (1, 3) connects to (1, 2), which is impossible because (1, 3) is *behind* (1, 2) if it came from (1, 3), but the body list structure implies (1, 2) is the head, and (1, 3) is the tail, meaning Snake #0 moved from (1, 3) to (1, 2), and (1, 3) is now its single body segment. This contradicts its move on Turn 7 (stated in the last rationale as moving RIGHT to (1, 3) from (0, 3)). Let me assume the body list is simply indicating the cells occupied by the body segments, and the order is often inverted in these outputs, but the length is `len(body) + 1`. Length 2.\n\nLet's use the provided diagram and coordinates to deduce the likely enemy state after Turn 8.\nTurn 8 Start: ID 1 head (1, 5), ID 0 head (1, 3), Apple at (1, 4).\nMy move: RIGHT to (2, 5).\nSnake #0's most logical move: UP to (1, 4) (eating apple).\nIf #0 ate, its length should be 3.\nNew Head T9: (1, 4). Body T9: [(1, 3), (X, Y)].\n\nHowever, the provided current state for Snake #0 is:\nSnake #0 - Head: (1, 2), Body: [(1, 3)], Apples: 1. Length 2.\n\nThis means that on Turn 8, Snake #0 moved DOWN from its previous position of (1, 3) to (1, 2), and **did not eat the apple at (1, 4)!**\n\n**Revised Status Update (Based strictly on Turn 9 data):**\n1.  **ID 1 (Me) at (2, 5).** Expected.\n2.  **ID 0 at (1, 2).** Length 2. It moved DOWN from (1, 3).\n3.  **Apple (1, 4) is still on the board.** (It is not listed among the apples, coordinates 1, 4 is currently marked as 'A'). Wait, the list of apples is: (9, 3), (1, 4), (9, 5), (0, 1), (7, 2). YES, (1, 4) is still an apple.\n\nMy sacrifice of the (1, 4) apple to avoid collision was unnecessary, as Snake #0 moved *away* from the apple. I missed an opportunity, but I am still alive and now positioned at (2, 5).\n\n**Immediate Goals:** The apple at (1, 4) is still very close, distance 2 from (2, 5). My planned target, (7, 2), is distance 6.\n\n**Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance from (2, 5)):**\n1. (1, 4): |2-1| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n2. (0, 1): |2-0| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6\n3. (7, 2): |2-7| + |5-2| = 5 + 3 = 8 (Error in Turn 8 calculation, 5+3=8, not 6. My previous (1, 5) to (7, 2) was 6+3=9.)\n4. (9, 5): |2-9| + |5-5| = 7 + 0 = 7\n5. (9, 3): |2-9| + |5-3| = 7 + 2 = 9\n\nThe apple at (1, 4) is the highest priority now (Distance 2).\n\n**Contest Analysis for (1, 4):**\nID 1 Head: (2, 5). Path D=2. E.g., LEFT, DOWN. Arrival T11.\nID 0 Head: (1, 2). Path D=2. E.g., UP, LEFT. Arrival T11.\n\nBoth snakes are D=2 away. This is potentially another race/collision scenario.\n\nPath ID 1: (2, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4). Requires LEFT then DOWN.\nPath ID 0: (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4). Requires UP then UP.\n\nIf both commit to this apple, who gets there first? They arrive simultaneously unless one can shave a move. No, they both arrive on T11. We need to look one turn ahead (T10).\n\nT10 Prediction:\nID 1 safe moves towards (1, 4): LEFT (to 1, 5) or DOWN (to 2, 4)?\nIf LEFT to (1, 5): (1, 5) is safe (it's the cell where my body *was* last turn, but the tail (2, 6) moved to (1, 6), and (1, 6) moved to (1, 5), (1, 5) moved to (2, 5) - my body is currently at (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6). Wait, the body list is head-to-tail. Head (2, 5). Body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)].\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 5), I hit my own body! This move is lethal.\n\nID 1 Safe Moves from (2, 5):\n1. UP (to 2, 6): **DANGER!** (2, 6) is my tail segment. Safe if I don't eat, but risky.\n2. DOWN (to 2, 4): Safe. Distance to (1, 4) is now 1 (L, D).\n3. LEFT (to 1, 5): **LETHAL!** Segment 1 of body. (1, 5)\n4. RIGHT (to 3, 5): Safe. Moves away from apples.\n\nSince moving LEFT (my fastest vector towards (1, 4)) is lethal, I must take the longer route by moving DOWN to (2, 4).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 4) (T9):\nNew distance to (1, 4): |2-1| + |4-4| = 1.\nPath: (2, 5) -> DOWN (2, 4) -> LEFT (1, 4). Arrival T11.\n\nT10 Prediction for ID 0:\nID 0 is at (1, 2). It will surely move UP to (1, 3). (1, 3) is its body segment, but since it's the tail end, it is safe to move there, and it's the direct route to (1, 4).\nID 0 Head T10: (1, 3). Body T10: [(X, Y)].\n\nT10 Moves:\nID 1: (2, 4).\nID 0: (1, 3).\n\nT11 Prediction:\nID 1 at (2, 4). Move LEFT to (1, 4). (Eats apple)\nID 0 at (1, 3). Move UP to (1, 4).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION at (1, 4) on T11 if both move optimally!**\n\nThis apple (1, 4) is cursed. I must yield it again, or find a way to get there sooner without collision.\n\nSince my only safe direct path (DOWN, then LEFT) results in T11 collision, I cannot target (1, 4). If I try to flank via (0, 4) or (3, 4), the distance increases.\n\n**New Target: Pivot back to the right side.**\nMy previous analysis holds: I should move RIGHT towards the cluster (7, 2), (9, 5), and (9, 3).\n\nCurrent position (2, 5). Next safe move RIGHT to (3, 5).\n\n**Re-evaluating Targets from (2, 5) using safe move RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n1. (9, 5): D=6 from (3, 5).\n2. (7, 2): D=7 from (3, 5).\n3. (9, 3): D=8 from (3, 5).\n\nPath to (9, 5) is 6 STRAIGHT moves. If I move RIGHT now (T9), I arrive T15. This is faster and safer than trying to contest (1, 4) or (7, 2).\n\nLet's check if #0 can contest (9, 5).\nID 0 at (1, 2). D to (9, 5) is |1-9| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11.\nI have a significant lead (7 moves vs 11 moves).\n\n**Confirming Move:**\nMove: RIGHT (to 3, 5).\nSafety check: (3, 5) is safe. Not off board, not in my body [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)], not in ID 0 (1, 2), (1, 3). Safe.\n\nThis move reinforces the strategy of gaining distance from the enemy and securing an uncontested apple.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nT9: Move RIGHT to (3, 5). Target (9, 5).\nT10-T15: Move towards (9, 5) exclusively. This allows ID 0 to take the left-side apples (1, 4) and (0, 1), while I secure the right side. Since ID 0 is currently length 2 and has only 1 apple, yielding these contested apples is fine as long as I grow elsewhere.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nTurn 9: Move RIGHT to (3, 5). Target the uncontested apple at (9, 5). Distance 6 moves remaining after this turn.\nTurn 10-15: Continue moving RIGHT to (9, 5). Secure growth and space away from Snake #0.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nRIGHT",

Note: The previous head (2, 5) is now segment 1 of the body. My tail segment is (1, 6).\nEnemy Snake (ID 0) Head: (1, 1). Length 2. Apples: 1.\nBody (ID 0): [(1, 2)]. The previous head (1, 2) is now segment 1 of the body. Its tail moved off the board or it grew from (1, 0) to (1, 1) and its body was [(1, 2)]. *Wait, the output for ID 0 on Turn 10 shows Head: (1, 1), Body: [(1, 2)]. This implies ID 0 moved DOWN from (1, 2) to (1, 1) on Turn 9.* This confirms my prior assumption that ID 0 is often moving away from the closer apples (like (1, 4)).\n\nApples remaining: (9, 3), (1, 4), (9, 5), (0, 1), (7, 2).\n\nMy position (3, 5) is excellent, central, and slightly biased right, which was the goal from the last turn's rationale.\n\n**Goal Re-evaluation:**\nThe previous plan was to move RIGHT to secure the right-side cluster, specifically (9, 5), as it seemed uncontested.\n\n**Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance from (3, 5)):**\n1. (9, 5): |9-3| + |5-5| = 6 + 0 = 6 (Direct path RIGHT)\n2. (7, 2): |7-3| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7\n3. (9, 3): |9-3| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n4. (1, 4): |1-3| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3 (Contested with ID 0)\n5. (0, 1): |0-3| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nThe path to (9, 5) requires 6 straight moves. If I move RIGHT every turn, I arrive on T16.\n\n**Contest Analysis for (1, 4) (Distance 3):**\nID 1 Head: (3, 5). Optimal path (L, D, L) or (D, L, L). Arrival T13.\nID 0 Head: (1, 1). Optimal path (U, U, U). Distance 3. Arrival T13.\nIf I optimize for (1, 4), we still hit T13 simultaneously, guaranteeing a collision or forced detour.

D to (9, 5): |9-1| + |5-1| = 8 + 4 = 12.\nID 0 would arrive T22 at the earliest, assuming no growth. I have a 6-move lead. This is the safest, highest-utility target.\n\n**Current Safe Moves from (3, 5):**\n1. **UP to (3, 6):** Safe. Moves one step towards (7, 2) but away from (9, 5).\n2. **DOWN to (3, 4):** Safe.

Body [(3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)]. Tail is (1, 5) (was (1, 6)).\n\nID 0 Prediction:\nID 0 is at (1, 1). Its most appealing targets are (0, 1) [D=1] and (1, 4) [D=3]. Moving LEFT to (0, 1) is a 1-move safe guarantee of growth.\nPrediction: ID 0 moves LEFT to (0, 1) and eats the apple. Length becomes 3. Tail moves from (1, 2) to (1, 1). New segments: (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2).\n\nEven if ID 0 targets (1, 4) (by moving UP, which is safe), it poses no immediate threat to me at (4, 5).\n\nThe move RIGHT fully supports the long-term plan of isolating and collecting the right-side cluster.\n\n**Long Term Plan Update:**\nTarget: (9, 5).\nT10: RIGHT (4, 5).\nT11: RIGHT (5, 5).\nT12: RIGHT (6, 5).\nT13: RIGHT (7, 5).\nT14: RIGHT (8, 5).\nT15: RIGHT (9, 5).

Their score is now 2, and their length increased.*\n\nApples remaining: (9, 3), (1, 4), (9, 5), (7, 2), (4, 4).\n\n**Goals:**\nThe primary goal remains safely collecting the uncontested right-side apples, specifically (9, 5). My current position (4, 5) puts me exactly halfway there (D=5).\n\n**Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance from (4, 5)):**\n1. (9, 5): |9-4| + |5-5| = 5 (Direct path RIGHT)\n2. (4, 4): |4-4| + |4-5| = 1 (Immediate move DOWN) - *This is now the closest apple!*\n3. (7, 2): |7-4| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n4. (1, 4): |1-4| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4\n5. (9, 3): |9-4| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n**Decision Point: Quick Apple (4, 4) vs. Strategic Apple (9, 5)**\n\n**Option A: Target (4, 4) (Distance 1)**\nMove: DOWN to (4, 4). This immediately secures an apple and increases my lead.\n*Safety Check:*\n1. Wall/Board: (4, 4) is safe.\n2. My Body: (3, 5) is behind me. Safe.\n3. Enemy Heads:\n    * ID 0 is at (0, 1). Distance to (4, 4) is |4-0| + |4-1| = 7. No risk of collision.\nThis move is 100% safe and guarantees growth.\n\n**Option B: Continue to (9, 5) (Distance 5)**\nMove: RIGHT to (5, 5). This keeps me on the path to the high-value cluster.\n*Safety Check:*\n1. Wall/Board: (5, 5) is safe.\n2. My Body: (3, 5) is behind me. Safe.\n3. Enemy Heads: ID 0 at (0, 1) is far away. Safe.\n\n**Comparison:**\nWhile the long-term plan targets (9, 5), an immediate apple at (4, 4) significantly increases my length and score without requiring any strategic change (I can pivot back to the right easily afterwards). Gaining an extra segment now is crucial for future board control and defensive maneuvering, especially since ID 0 is now also growing.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 4) this turn, I eat the apple. My new score is 4. New Head: (4, 4). Body: [(4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)]. Length 5.\n\nFrom (4, 4), the path to (9, 5) has a distance of |9-4| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6. This is only one move longer than if I had aimed for (9, 5) directly from (4, 5). The benefit of immediate growth outweighs the minimal path delay.\n\n**Considering ID 0 Movement:**\nID 0 is at (0, 1).\nIt will likely move towards (1, 4) (D=4) or (7, 2) (D=8).\nMove UP to (0, 2): D to (1, 4) = 3.\nMove RIGHT to (1, 1): D to (1, 4) = 3 (but (1, 1) is body). Wait, (1, 1) is now segment 1 of ID 0's body! ID 0 cannot move RIGHT.\nSafe moves for ID 0: UP to (0, 2), LEFT to (-1, 1) (Lethal if ID 0 is careless), DOWN to (0, 0).\nSince ID 0 is currently adjacent to the wall, it most likely moves UP to (0, 2) or DOWN to (0, 0). Up seems strategically better for them to reach (1, 4).\nIf ID 0 moves UP to (0, 2), they are still nowhere near (4, 4) or my future path.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move DOWN to (4, 4) is safe, optimal for immediate growth, and does not compromise the long-term strategy of securing the right side.\n\n**Long Term Plan Update:**\n1. T11: Move DOWN to (4, 4) and eat the apple.\n2. T12: From (4, 4), move RIGHT to (5, 4). This re-orients toward the right side.\n3. T13 onwards: Continue targeting (9, 5) and (9, 3).\n\nDOWN",

(9, 5): |9-4| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6 (Target 1)\n2. (9, 3): |9-4| + |3-4| = 5 + 1 = 6 (Target 2)\n3. (7, 2): |7-4| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n4. (1, 4): |1-4| + |4-4| = 3 + 0 = 3 (This is now contested by ID 0)\n5. (4, 7): |4-4| + |7-4| = 3 (Straight UP)\n\n**Candidate Moves from (4, 4):**\n1. UP to (4, 5): This is my body segment. **(Fatal)**\n2. DOWN to (4, 3): Safe. Distance to (9, 5) is 7. Distance to (9, 3) is 5.\n3. LEFT to (3, 4): Safe. Distance to (9, 5) is 7. Distance to (9, 3) is 7. Closer to (1, 4) (D=2).\n4. RIGHT to (5, 4): Safe. Distance to (9, 5) is 5. Distance to (9, 3) is 5.\n\n**Safety Check (ID 0 Head is at (0, 2)):**\nID 0's possible moves: UP to (0, 3), RIGHT to (1, 2), DOWN to (0, 1) (body segment, **Fatal**), LEFT to (-1, 2) (Wall, **Fatal**).\nID 0 can move UP or RIGHT.\n* If ID 0 moves UP to (0, 3): Path to (1, 4) is D=2.\n* If ID 0 moves RIGHT to (1, 2): Path to (1, 4) is D=2.\n\nSince ID 0 is focused on the left side, there is no immediate collision risk with any of my safe moves (4, 3), (3, 4), or (5, 4).\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n**A. RIGHT to (5, 4):**\n* Pro: This is the critical move to re-orient towards the strategic high-value right-side apples (9, 5) and (9, 3). It reduces the distance to both by 1.\n* Distances: D((5, 4) to (9, 5)) = 5; D((5, 4) to (9, 3)) = 5.\n* Snake 1 future location: (5, 4). This cell is open.\n\n**B. LEFT to (3, 4):**\n* Pro: Gets slightly closer to the contested apple (1, 4) (D=2).\n* Con: Moves away from the previously planned right-side cluster.\n* Risk: If I move LEFT, I am potentially drawing closer to ID 0, which complicates the path for an apple that ID 0 might reach first/simultaneously. (1, 4) is D=3 from ID 0's current location (0, 2). If ID 0 moves RIGHT to (1, 2) this turn, they are D=2 away. If I move LEFT to (3, 4), I am D=2 away. If the opponent decides to go for it, a competitive race ensues, which is generally not ideal if uncontested alternatives exist.\n\n**C. DOWN to (4, 3):**\n* Pro: Gets closer to (7, 2) (D=4) and (9, 3) (D=5).\n* Con: Does not position me optimally for (9, 5).\n\n**D. UP to (4, 5):** **KILLS ME (into body)**\n\n**Decision:**\nThe long-term strategy dictated moving right after securing (4, 4) to pursue the uncontested high-value apples (9, 5) and (9, 3). Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) aligns perfectly with this plan, making both apples D=5 away. This avoids tangling with Snake 0 on the left side where they are already positioned to contest (1, 4) and potentially push towards (7, 2). I have a significant lead in length and apples, so continuing safe, isolating expansion is key.\n\n**Long Term Plan Update:**\n1. T12 (Current): Move RIGHT to (5, 4).\n2. T13: Move RIGHT to (6, 4).\n3. T14: Move RIGHT to (7, 4).\n4. T15: Move UP to (7, 5) or RIGHT to (8, 4) to approach (9, 5). Given the proximity of (9, 5), going for it first seems slightly better, then (9, 3).\n\nRIGHT",

Tail: (0, 2).\n\nApples remaining: (9, 3), (9, 5), (7, 2), (4, 7), (2, 6).\n\nI successfully moved right and am now at (7, 4). My objective remains to secure the eastern apples first.\n\n**Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance from (7, 4)):**\n1. (9, 5): |9-7| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3 (Target 1)\n2. (9, 3): |9-7| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3 (Target 2)\n3. (7, 2): |7-7| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2 (Closest)\n4. (4, 7): |4-7| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n5. (2, 6): |2-7| + |6-4| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nThe closest apple is now (7, 2) at D=2. The two eastern apples are D=3.\n\n**Candidate Moves from (7, 4):**\n1. UP to (7, 5): Safe. D((7, 5) to (9, 5)) = 2. D((7, 5) to (9, 3)) = 4. (Favors (9, 5))\n2. DOWN to (7, 3): Safe. D((7, 3) to (9, 5)) = 4. D((7, 3) to (9, 3)) = 2. (Favors (9, 3))\n3. LEFT to (6, 4): My body segment. (Fatal)\n4. RIGHT to (8, 4): Safe. D((8, 4) to (9, 5)) = 2. D((8, 4) to (9, 3)) = 2. (Optimizes for both)\n\nLet's also check moving to (7, 2) which has an apple.\n*   Move DOWN to (7, 3), then DOWN to (7, 2). That's 2 turns.\n\n**Safety Check (ID 0 Head is at (1, 4)):**\nID 0 moved UP last turn (from (1, 3)).\nID 0's possible moves:\n1. UP to (1, 5): Safe.\n2. DOWN to (1, 3): Body segment. (Fatal)\n3. LEFT to (0, 4): Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (2, 4): Safe.\n\nID 0 is very far away (Manhattan distance 6 from (7, 4)) and poses no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\nWe have three primary options:\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT to (8, 4):** This keeps both (9, 5) and (9, 3) equally close (D=2) and enables wide-open movements on the right side. This maximizes flexibility towards the high-value eastern cluster.\n    *   *Follow-up:* From (8, 4), move RIGHT to (9, 4) (Next turn, T16). D=1 to (9, 5) and (9, 3). Then UP/DOWN for the apple (T17). Total 3 turns.\n\n2.  **Move UP to (7, 5):** Commits slightly more to (9, 5) (D=2) than (9, 3) (D=4). Also pulls us away from the (7, 2) apple (D=3).\n    *   *Follow-up:* From (7, 5), move RIGHT to (8, 5) (T16). D=1 to (9, 5). Then RIGHT to (9, 5) (T17 - Apple!). Total 2 turns to (9, 5).\n\n3.  **Move DOWN to (7, 3):** Commits slightly more to (9, 3) (D=2) than (9, 5) (D=4). This also positions us to access the (7, 2) apple.\n    *   *Follow-up:* From (7, 3), move DOWN to (7, 2) (T16 - Apple!). Total 1 turn to (7, 2).\n\n**Decision:**\n\nOption 3 (DOWN) leads to an immediate apple capture in 1 turn (T16).\nOption 2 (UP) leads to a cluster apple capture in 2 turns (T17).\n\nWhile the plan was to secure the cluster, the immediate proximity of (7, 2) (D=2, one move away from the next cell) offers a guaranteed point without diverting too much. If I move DOWN to (7, 3), I am perfectly positioned for (7, 2) next turn. Furthermore, (7, 3) still maintains good access to (9, 3).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the previous plan of moving to (7, 5) targeting (9, 5).\n*   If I move UP to (7, 5) now (T15), I decrease the distance to (9, 5) to 2.\n*   If I move DOWN to (7, 3) now (T15), I set up for (7, 2) immediately.\n\nThe Apple at (7, 2) is highly accessible and uncontested. Securing it quickly is a safe and high-probability move.\n\n1.  T15: Move DOWN to (7, 3).\n2.  T16: Move DOWN to (7, 2) (Apple!). Length 6.\n3.  T17: Focus on (9, 3) or (9, 5). From (7, 2): Move RIGHT to (8, 2). D((8, 2) to (9, 3)) = 2.\n\nThis guarantees an apple faster than focusing purely on the (9, X) cluster initially.\n\nI will move DOWN.\n\n**Long Term Plan Update (Aim for (7, 2) then Eastern Cluster):**\n1. T15 (Current): Move DOWN to (7, 3).\n2. T16: Move DOWN to (7, 2) (Apple!).\n3. T17: Move towards (9, 3). Likely RIGHT to (8, 2).\n\nDOWN",

Since an apple *was* eaten, the tail did not move, and the entire previous body shifted. (7, 3) is now the second segment of the snake. **UP is FATAL.**\n2. DOWN to (7, 1): Safe.

This looks best.\n\n**Safety Check (vs. Snake #0):**\nSnake #0 is at (2, 5). ID 0 is focused on the NW side. Manhattan distances:\n(7, 2) to (2, 5) is 5 + 3 = 8. No immediate collision risk.\n\nID 0's possible moves from (2, 5):\n1. UP to (2, 6): **Apple!** (Probability high)\n2. DOWN to (2, 4): Safe.\n3. LEFT to (1, 5): Body. (Fatal, body is [(1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)])\n4. RIGHT to (3, 5): Safe.\n\nIf ID 0 moves UP to (2, 6), they eat an apple and grow. This is likely their best move.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves for ID 1:**\n\nWe want to get to the eastern targets (9, 3) or (8, 4).\n\n1. **Move RIGHT to (8, 2):**\n    *   Distance to (9, 3) is 2 (e.g., (9, 2) -> (9, 3)).\n    *   Distance to (8, 4) is 2 (e.g., (8, 3) -> (8, 4)).\n    *   This is an excellent positioning move.\n\n2. **Move LEFT or DOWN:** Retreats, giving Snake #0 an unnecessary advantage in point accumulation.\n\n**Goal:** Head towards the nearest targets (8, 4) or (9, 3). Moving RIGHT to (8, 2) positions me centrally to strike both.\n\nIf I move RIGHT (to (8, 2)):\nT18: I can move UP to (8, 3) (1 step towards (8, 4) or (9, 3)) or RIGHT to (9, 2).\nIf I move UP to (8, 3), then T19: I can hit (9, 3) (RIGHT) or (8, 4) (UP). Total 2 turns to get to either (8, 4) or (9, 3).\n\nIf I move RIGHT again (to (9, 2)), then T19: Move UP to (9, 3) (Apple!). Total 2 turns. This seems faster and more direct.\n\nThe overall safest and most efficient move is RIGHT.\n\n**Long Term Plan Update (Aim for the Eastern Cluster):**\n1. T17 (Current): Move RIGHT to (8, 2). Length 6.\n2. T18: Move RIGHT to (9, 2). This puts me directly below apple (9, 3).\n3. T19: Move UP to (9, 3) (Apple!). Length 7.\n4. T20: Target (8, 4) or (9, 5).\n\nRIGHT\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 17 / 150\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\nMy snake (ID 1) Head: (7, 2). Length 6 (gained apple at (7, 2)).\nBody (ID 1): [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]. Tail is at (4, 4).\nApples remaining: (9, 3) D=3, (8, 4) D=3, (9, 5) D=5, (4, 7) D=8, (2, 6) D=9.\nID 0 Head: (2, 5). ID 0 is likely moving to (2, 6) (Apple).\n\n**Safety Check:**\nMoves from (7, 2):\n1. UP to (7, 3): FATAL (Self-collision, (7, 3) is now the second body segment and no tail segment moved out).\n2. DOWN to (7, 1): Safe but retreats.\n3. LEFT to (6, 2): Safe but retreats.\n4. RIGHT to (8, 2): Safe, moves towards closest targets (9, 3) and (8, 4).\n\n**Optimal Strategy:**\nThe fastest way to secure the next apple, (9, 3), is via the right side of the board.\n\n1. T17: Move RIGHT to (8, 2).\n2. T18: Move RIGHT to (9, 2).\n3. T19: Move UP to (9, 3) (Apple!).\n\nThis plan secures the next apple in 2 turns.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

The tail is at (5, 4).\n(Note: Since no apple was eaten last turn (T17), the body shifted, and the previous tail segment (4, 4) moved away. The new tail is (5, 4).)\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0) Head is at (2, 6). Length 5.\nBody (ID 0): [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]. The tail is at (1, 3).\n(Note: Snake 0 was at (2, 5) and moved to (2, 6) which was an apple, so it grew. The cell (2, 5) is now body segment 2, and the tail (1, 3) remained in place.)\n\nApples remaining: (9, 3), (9, 5), (4, 7), (8, 4), (2, 9).\n*Wait, the provided board state shows apples at: (9, 3), (9, 5), (4, 7), (8, 4), (2, 9).*\n*My previous state analysis incorrectly listed (2, 6) as an apple. Looking at the current board, (2, 6) is where the enemy snake #0 moved into. Thus, ID 0 successfully ate the apple at (2, 6) in the last turn.*\n\n**Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance from (8, 2)):**\n1. (9, 3): |9-8| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 (Primary Target)\n2. (8, 4): |8-8| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2 (Secondary Target)\n3. (9, 5): |9-8| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n4. (4, 7): |4-8| + |7-2| = 4 + 5 = 9\n5. (2, 9): |2-8| + |9-2| = 6 + 7 = 13 (Far)\n\nThe immediate goal is (9, 3) or (8, 4). (9, 3) is reachable via a direct path: RIGHT then UP.\n\n**Candidate Moves from (8, 2) and Safety Check:**\n\n1. UP to (8, 3): Safe. (8, 3) is an empty cell. Moves 1 step closer to (8, 4) and 1 step towards the path to (9, 3).\n2. DOWN to (8, 1): Safe. Retreats from immediate targets.\n3. LEFT to (7, 2): Self-collision! (7, 2) is the second body segment. **FATAL.**\n4. RIGHT to (9, 2): Safe. Moves directly towards (9, 3). Edge of the board.\n\n**Collision Check (vs. Snake #0 at (2, 6)):**\nSnake #0 is far away and currently focusing on the NW quadrant (likely moving towards (2, 9) or (4, 7)). No collision risk.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\nWe have two primary safe forward options: UP to (8, 3) or RIGHT to (9, 2). Both lead to an apple in 1 or 2 turns.\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 3):**\n    *   T19: Can move UP again to (8, 4) (Apple!). (Total 2 turns)\n    *   T19: Or move RIGHT to (9, 3) (Apple!). (Total 2 turns)\n    *   This keeps two options open for the next turn.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n    *   T19: Must move UP to (9, 3) (Apple!). (Total 2 turns)\n    *   This is a more focused path to (9, 3).\n\nSince both paths yield an apple in 2 turns, let's consider which position is strategically better afterwards.\n\nIf I eat (9, 3): I will be at (9, 3). Next targets are (8, 4) (D=2), (9, 5) (D=2).\nIf I eat (8, 4): I will be at (8, 4). Next targets are (9, 3) (D=2), (9, 5) (D=2).\n\nThe 'RIGHT then UP' path to (9, 3) is marginally simpler as it uses the edge of the board.\nPath: (8, 2) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 3) [Apple]\n\nThe 'UP then UP/RIGHT' path to either (8, 4) or (9, 3) offers flexibility.\nPath 1: (8, 2) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 4) [Apple]\nPath 2: (8, 2) -> (8, 3) -> (9, 3) [Apple]\n\nChoosing UP to (8, 3) gives me the ability to decide just before T19 whether to prioritize (8, 4) or (9, 3). This added flexibility is valuable, although the target positions are largely interchangeable. Since the path to (8, 4) is straight UP, and (8, 4) is slightly more central than (9, 3), I'll choose UP.\n\nLet's check for any potential long-term issues:\nIf I move UP to (8, 3), my body is still stretched across (5, 4) to (7, 4) and (7, 2). This high location is safe and keeps me far from Snake #0.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (8, 3) is the best choice for maximal flexibility while progressing toward the apples.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1. T18: Move UP to (8, 3). (Maintain flexibility for T19)\n2. T19: Evaluate (8, 4) vs (9, 3). Move to one of them (e.g., UP to (8, 4) or RIGHT to (9, 3)). (Apple!)\n3. T20: Target the next closest apple ((9, 5) or the one not eaten above).\n\nUP",

(7, 3) is a body segment. **FATAL.**\n4. RIGHT to (9, 3): **APPLE!** Safe, moves onto (9, 3). (Priority 2)\n\nWait, I missed that LEFT and DOWN are now self-collisions because the body segment (8, 2) is right behind me, and (7, 3) is further down the chain.\nHead: (8, 3). Body: [(8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)].\n- DOWN to (8, 2): Into body segment 1. Fatal.\n- LEFT to (7, 3): Into body segment 3. Fatal.\n- (7, 2) is segment 2. Going to (7, 3) is also fatal. My current body structure does not allow L or D moves.\n\n**This is critical: my only safe moves are UP and RIGHT, both of which are apples.**\n\n**Evaluation of Apple Choices (UP vs RIGHT):**\n\n1. **Move UP to (8, 4) [Apple]:**\n    *   Resulting Head: (8, 4). Length becomes 7.\n    *   Future targets: (9, 3) (D=2), (9, 5) (D=2).\n    *   Position: Slightly more central than (9, 3).\n    *   Safety: No collisions risk with Snake #0, as it is far to the NW.\n\n2. **Move RIGHT to (9, 3) [Apple]:**\n    *   Resulting Head: (9, 3). Length becomes 7.\n    *   Future targets: (8, 4) (D=2), (9, 5) (D=2).\n    *   Position: On the eastern edge.\n\nBoth moves are equally beneficial in terms of score and immediate distance to the next remaining apples (which would be (9, 5)).\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 4), my next critical moves could be RIGHT to (9, 4) (then potentially UP to (9, 5)) or DOWN to (8, 3) then RIGHT to (9, 3).\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 3), my next critical moves could be UP to (9, 4) (then potentially UP to (9, 5)) or LEFT to (8, 3) then UP to (8, 4).\n\nSince (8, 4) is slightly less constrained than (9, 3) (which is on the far right boundary), moving to (8, 4) gives slightly more movement space in future turns (specifically, access to (7, 4) and (9, 4)).\n\nLet's check the area around Snake #0: Head (2, 7) is near apple (4, 7) (D=4) and (2, 9) (D=2). It is extremely likely Snake #0 is moving UP towards (2, 9).\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 8).\nT20: Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 9) [Apple].\n\nThis confirms I should focus on the apples in the SE quadrant, which I am doing.\n\nI will prioritize **UP** to (8, 4) as it keeps me slightly more central.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1. T19: Move UP to (8, 4) [Apple].\n2. T20: Target (9, 5). Move (8, 4) -> (9, 4) (RIGHT).\n3.

Length 7 (since I ate an apple last turn).\nBody (ID 1): [(8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. The tail is now at (6, 4) because I grew.\nApples at: (9, 3), (9, 5), (4, 7), (2, 9), (3, 3).\n\nI successfully executed UP and ate the apple at (8, 4) in Turn 19 (Note: the apple list provided for Turn 20 is the list *after* the T19 move, so (8, 4) is correctly removed).\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0) Head is at (2, 8). Length 5.\nBody (ID 0): [(2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5)]. The tail is at (1, 5). (Snake 0 moved from (2, 7) to (2, 8). This was not an apple, so its tail (1, 4 from T19) shifted to (1, 5), and the segment (1, 4) is now empty).\n\n**Objective:** Secure the remaining apples in the SE quadrant: (9, 3) and (9, 5), and (3, 3).\n\n**Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance from (8, 4)):**\n1. (9, 3): |9-8| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 (RIGHT then DOWN)\n2. (9, 5): |9-8| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 (RIGHT then UP)\n3. (3, 3): |3-8| + |3-4| = 5 + 1 = 6\n4. (4, 7): |4-8| + |7-4| = 4 + 3 = 7\n5. (2, 9): |2-8| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\nThe nearest apples are (9, 3) and (9, 5). Both require 2 moves. I planned to go for (9, 5) first, as it keeps me moving along the edge, potentially securing (9, 3) after.\n\n**Candidate Moves from (8, 4) and Safety Check:**\n\n1. UP to (8, 5): Safe. Moves toward (9, 5).\n2. DOWN to (8, 3): Into the first body segment. **FATAL.**\n3. LEFT to (7, 4): Into the last segment of the original T19 body (T19 body was [(8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)]). Since I grew, (7, 4) is now the 5th segment. **FATAL.**\n4. RIGHT to (9, 4): Safe. Moves towards (9, 3) and (9, 5).\n\nWait, let's re-verify the body segments:\nHead: (8, 4)\nBody: (8, 3) [1], (8, 2) [2], (7, 2) [3], (7, 3) [4], (7, 4) [5], (6, 4) [6] (Tail)\n\n- DOWN to (8, 3) is a collision.\n- LEFT to (7, 4): (7, 4) is the 5th segment. Collision (self-collision).\n\nMy safe moves are only UP and RIGHT.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves (UP vs RIGHT):**\n\n1. **Move UP to (8, 5):**\n    *   Future path to (9, 5) (Apple): RIGHT to (9, 5). Total 2 moves.\n    *   Future path to (9, 3) (Apple): RIGHT to (9, 5), then DOWN (9, 4), then DOWN (9, 3). (Or RIGHT, UP, then long path back.)\n    *   Pros: Keeps board presence open.\n    *   Cons: Doesn't directly target either (9, 3) or (9, 5) in a single step (both require movement RIGHT first).\n\n2. **Move RIGHT to (9, 4):**\n    *   Future path to (9, 5) (Apple): UP to (9, 5). Total 2 moves.\n    *   Future path to (9, 3) (Apple): DOWN to (9, 3). Total 2 moves.\n    *   Pros: Places me one step away from *both* (9, 5) and (9, 3). Allows flexibility to pick the safer/better apple next turn.\n    *   Cons: Moves closer to the right edge.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 4) is superior because it maximizes my options for the next turn to grab either of the two nearest apples, (9, 5) or (9, 3).\n\n**Checking Enemy Position (Snake #0):**\nHead at (2, 8). Snake #0 is likely going for (2, 9) (Apple, D=1).\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 9), it eats an apple.\n\nMy moves are far away, so collision risk is minimal.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT to (9, 4). This sets up a perfect two-move sequence to secure (9, 5) or (9, 3). I will prioritize (9, 5) as planned previously, but if going DOWN to (9, 3) proves safer, I can choose that.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1. T20 (Now): Move RIGHT to (9, 4). This position allows access to (9, 5) and (9, 3).\n2. T21: Target (9, 5). Move UP to (9, 5) [Apple].\n3. T22: Target (9, 3). Move DOWN to (9, 4), then DOWN to (9, 3) [Apple]. (If safe, considering body logistics).\n\nRIGHT",

Tail is at (7, 4). (Note: My last move was RIGHT to (9, 4). Since I did not eat, (6, 4) was the old tail. The body shifts: (8, 4) is new segment 1, (8, 3) is 2, (8, 2) is 3, (7, 2) is 4, (7, 3) is 5, (7, 4) is 6. The previous tail (6, 4) is now empty.)\n\nApples at: (9, 3), (9, 5), (4, 7), (3, 3), (5, 0).\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0) Head is at (2, 9). Length 6 (Snake 0 moved UP from (2, 8) and ate the apple at (2, 9)).\nBody (ID 0): [(2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5)]. Tail is at (1, 5).\n\n**Objective:** Secure the remaining apples in the SE quadrant: (9, 3) and (9, 5).\n\n**Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance from (9, 4)):**\n1. (9, 5): |9-9| + |5-4| = 1 (UP)\n2. (9, 3): |9-9| + |3-4| = 1 (DOWN)\n3. (3, 3): |3-9| + |3-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n4. (4, 7): |4-9| + |7-4| = 5 + 3 = 8\n5. (5, 0): |5-9| + |0-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nI successfully positioned myself at (9, 4), one step away from two apples: (9, 5) and (9, 3). I need to decide which one to grab.\n\n**Enemy Position Check:**\nSnake 0 is at (2, 9), stuck on the top edge. It can only move LEFT (1, 9) or stay put based on my knowledge of its past moves (it seems to prefer boundaries). It poses no immediate threat.\n\n**Candidate Moves from (9, 4) and Safety Check (Self-Collision):**\n\nMy body segments are: S1=(8, 4), S2=(8, 3), S3=(8, 2), S4=(7, 2), S5=(7, 3), S6=(7, 4) (Tail).\n\n1. UP to (9, 5): Apple. Safe. (Eats apple, grows).\n2. DOWN to (9, 3): Apple. Safe. (Eats apple, grows).\n3. LEFT to (8, 4): Into the first body segment. **FATAL collision.**\n4. RIGHT to (10, 4): **FATAL collision** (Off-board).\n\nMy only two safe moves are UP and DOWN, both leading to apples.\n\n**Evaluation (UP vs DOWN):**\n\n1. **Move UP to (9, 5):**\n    *   Result: Eat apple, length becomes 8. Head at (9, 5).\n    *   Next move potential: From (9, 5), I can move DOWN back to (9, 4) and then DOWN to (9, 3) to grab the second apple. Or I can move LEFT to (8, 5) to open up the path.\n\n2. **Move DOWN to (9, 3):**\n    *   Result: Eat apple, length becomes 8. Head at (9, 3).\n    *   Next move potential: From (9, 3), I can move UP back to (9, 4) and then UP to (9, 5) to grab the second apple. Or I can move LEFT to (8, 3).\n\nBoth are equally beneficial in terms of immediate score, as they secure an apple. I need to consider what leads to better future positioning.\n\n*If I move UP to (9, 5):* I have the top-right corner.\n*If I move DOWN to (9, 3):* I have the bottom-right corner area.\n\nIf I eat (9, 5), my body will occupy (9, 4) and then stretch back toward (7, 4).\nIf I then try to grab (9, 3), I move (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3).\nWhen moving from (9, 5) to (9, 4) (T22), (9, 4) will be open because the head moves off (9, 5). This path is safe.\n\nIf I eat (9, 3), my body will occupy (9, 4) and then stretch back toward (7, 4).\nIf I then try to grab (9, 5), I move (9, 3) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 5).\nWhen moving from (9, 3) to (9, 4) (T22), (9, 4) will be open. This path is also safe.\n\nSince I am at (9, 4), moving UP keeps me slightly further from the condensed body cluster around (8, 4) and (8, 3). If I move DOWN, I might unintentionally block off my tail exit if the body shifts (though the tail is far away at (7, 4)).\n\nUltimately, both moves are excellent. I will stick to my initial plan of favoring the slightly more open space to the North, heading towards (9, 5).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1. T21 (Now): Move UP to (9, 5). (Eat Apple)\n2. T22: Move DOWN to (9, 4).\n3. T23: Move DOWN to (9, 3). (Eat Apple)\n4. T24: Determine next target, likely (3, 3) or (4, 7), requiring movement LEFT along the bottom/middle of the board.\n\nUP",

Tail is at (2, 5).\n\n**Objective:** Secure the proximal apples, starting with (9, 3).\n\n**Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance from (9, 5)):**\n1. (9, 3): |9-9| + |3-5| = 2 (2 steps DOWN)\n2. (4, 7): |4-9| + |7-5| = 5 + 2 = 7\n3. (3, 3): |3-9| + |3-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n4. (5, 0): |5-9| + |0-5| = 4 + 5 = 9\n5. (4, 5): |4-9| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\nMy closest target is (9, 3).\n\n**Candidate Moves from (9, 5) and Safety Check:**\n\nMy body segments are: S1=(9, 4), S2=(8, 4), S3=(8, 3), S4=(8, 2), S5=(7, 2), S6=(7, 3), S7=(7, 4) (Tail).\n\n1. UP to (9, 6): Safe.\n2. DOWN to (9, 4): Into the first body segment (S1). **FATAL collision (moving backwards).**\n3. LEFT to (8, 5): Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (10, 5): **FATAL collision** (Off-board).\n\nWait, I need to re-read the move rule *carefully* regarding moving backwards when the snake has grown.\n\n*Rule:* \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\" When the snake grows, the old tail position is retained as part of the body. My body segments are reported as: $[(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]$. The segment immediately behind the head (9, 5) is (9, 4). Moving DOWN to (9, 4) is moving directly backwards into the cell immediately behind the head, which is explicitly forbidden and results in death. **Move DOWN is FATAL.**\n\nSince I just ate, the segment (9, 4) is now permanently part of my body for this turn and the next. I must move away from it.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining:** UP, LEFT.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 6):** Moves me away from the target (9, 3) and pushes me into the corner. From (9, 6), safe moves are DOWN (to (9, 5), which becomes available if I didn't grow) or LEFT (to (8, 6)). This delays capturing (9, 3).\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 5):** This moves me closer to the center of the board and provides more maneuverability. From (8, 5), I have options: UP (8, 6), DOWN (8, 4 - **FATAL, S2 position**), LEFT (7, 5), RIGHT (9, 5).\n\nNeither UP nor LEFT immediately allows me to grab (9, 3). I need a path that opens up (9, 4) so I can move through it safely on a subsequent turn.\n\n**Strategy to reach (9, 3):**\nTo reach (9, 3) from (9, 5), I need (9, 4) to be empty when I traverse it.\n1. T22 (Now): Move AWAY from (9, 4). Let's pick LEFT to (8, 5).\n   *   Head: (8, 5). Body shifts: (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3). Tail (7, 3). (7, 4) is now *open* (since I grew last turn, the tail didn't vanish, but now that I didn't eat, one segment drops). Wait, if I moved from (9, 4) -> (9, 5) and ate, the old tail (7, 4) was retained. Now if I move (9, 5) -> (8, 5) and don't eat, the tail (7, 4) *vanishes*.\n\nLet's re-verify the body state after T21 (I grew).\nT21: Head moved (9, 4) -> (9, 5). Ate.\nOld Body (T20): [(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]. Length 7. (No, the provided body state was: Body: [(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]. Length 8. Wait, the turn information provided for T21 said: Body: [(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]. This means my total length was 1 (head) + 7 (body) = 8 before the move. The turn report says: \"Body: [(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]\" with head at (9, 5) and 7 apples. Let's assume the current state listed at the top is *correct* for T22, meaning I *am* length 8 now.\n\nCurrent Head: (9, 5)\nCurrent Body (S1 to S7): (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4).\nTotal Length: 8.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5) (T22, no food):\nNew Head: (8, 5).\nNew Body: (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3).\nThe old tail (7, 4) *opens up*.\n\nIf I move UP to (9, 6) (T22, no food):\nNew Head: (9, 6).\nNew Body: (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3).\nThe old tail (7, 4) *opens up*.\n\nComparing future possibilities:\n\n**If I choose LEFT to (8, 5) now (T22):**\nHead at (8, 5). Safe options: UP (8, 6), LEFT (7, 5), RIGHT (9, 5). DOWN (8, 4) is now S3 of the new body. FATAL.\n\nTo get to (9, 3):\nT23: Move RIGHT to (9, 5). (Safe, since 9, 5 is S2).\nNew Head: (9, 5). New Body: (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2). Tail (7, 2). (7, 3) opens.\n\nT24: Move DOWN to (9, 4). (Safe, since 9, 4 is S3).\nNew Head: (9, 4). New Body: (9, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2). Tail (8, 2). (7, 2) opens.\n*Hole* This path requires moving into S2 and S3, which is also fatal if no food is eaten and the body is moving. **I cannot move *through* my body segments unless they are the tail position which has vacated.** This strategy fails.\n\nI must use a \"loop\" maneuver to clear the path (9, 4).\n\n**If I choose UP to (9, 6) now (T22):**\nHead at (9, 6). Safe options: DOWN (9, 5, S2), LEFT (8, 6).\nT23: Move LEFT to (8, 6).\nHead at (8, 6). New Body: (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2). Tail (7, 2). (7, 3) opens.\nNow I am far away from (9, 3) by x-distance.\n\nT24: Move DOWN to (8, 5).\nT25: Move DOWN to (8, 4). **FATAL, 8, 4 is S4.**\n\nThis is getting complex because my body is so tightly packed in the (8, Y) / (9, Y) columns.\n\nLet's look for the fastest guaranteed exit route that clears (9, 4) for ingress to (9, 3).\n\nCurrent situation: H(9, 5), S1(9, 4), S2(8, 4).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5):\nT22: H(8, 5). B: (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), ... Tail open (7, 4).\n\nFrom (8, 5), I need to get back to (9, 3).\nThe key is to move the segment (9, 4) somewhere else.\nIf I move (8, 5) -> (8, 4), that is fatal.\nIf I move (8, 5) -> (9, 5) (Right), the body shifts one position: (8, 5) becomes S2, (9, 5) becomes S1. (9, 4) is now S3. I cannot move into (9, 4) safely next turn (T24).\n\nI must move into the row y=6 or y=7 to give myself room to circle.\n\nLet's stick with: **Move UP to (9, 6).**\n\nT22: UP to (9, 6).\nHead (9, 6). Body: (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3). (7, 4) free.\n\nT23: Move LEFT to (8, 6).\nHead (8, 6). Body: (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2). (7, 3) free.\n\nT24: Move DOWN to (8, 5).\nHead (8, 5). Body: (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2). (7, 2) free.\n\nT25: Move RIGHT to (9, 5).\nHead (9, 5). Body: (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3). (8, 2) free.\nNow H is back at (9, 5). S1 is (8, 5). S4 is (9, 5). Is this right? No, S1 is the one *I just left* (8, 5). S2 is (8, 6). S3 is (9, 6). S4 is (9, 5).\n\nT25 body structure: (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4). This calculation is wrong because I cannot move into (9, 5) if it is S4. **FATAL collision on T25.**\n\nIf I move (H) -> (9, 5), then (9, 5) must be empty on T25.\nIn T24, H is at (8, 5). Body: (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2). Tail (8, 2).\nS3 is (9, 5). Thus, moving RIGHT to (9, 5) is fatal on T25.\n\nI need a wider turn radius. Going UP allows me access to the top part of the board, which is currently unused. This is the safest way to shift the congested body segments (9, 4) and (8, 4).\n\n**Revised Strategy (Four Turns to Apple):**\n\n1. T22: Move **UP** to (9, 6). (Clears 7, 4 for tail to move if I don't eat).\n   H(9, 6). S1(9, 5), S2(9, 4), S3(8, 4).\n2. T23: Move **LEFT** to (8, 6).\n   H(8, 6). S1(9, 6), S2(9, 5), S3(9, 4), S4(8, 4).\n3. T24: Move **LEFT** to (7, 6).\n   H(7, 6). S1(8, 6), S2(9, 6), S3(9, 5), S4(9, 4), S5(8, 4).\n4. T25: Move **DOWN** to (7, 5).\n   H(7, 5). S1(7, 6), S2(8, 6), S3(9, 6), S4(9, 5), S5(9, 4), S6(8, 4).\n5. T26: Move **DOWN** to (7, 4). (This is the location of the former tail (7, 4) which is now clear).\n   H(7, 4). S1(7, 5), S2(7, 6), S3(8, 6), S4(9, 6), S5(9, 5), S6(9, 4).\n6. T27: Move **RIGHT** to (8, 4). (Safe, 8, 4 is S7).\n7. T28: Move **RIGHT** to (9, 4). (Safe, 9, 4 is S6).\n8. T29: Move **DOWN** to (9, 3). (EAT APPLE).\n\nThis is an 8-turn sequence, which is slow but safe. Given the enemy is far away and the board is mostly free, safety is paramount.\n\nLet's see if I can use (8, 5) as part of the loop.\n\n1. T22: Move UP to (9, 6).\n   H(9, 6). S1(9, 5), S2(9, 4), S3(8, 4).\n2. T23: Move LEFT to (8, 6).\n   H(8, 6). S1(9, 6), S2(9, 5), S3(9, 4), S4(8, 4).\n3. T24: Move DOWN to (8, 5). (Safe, 8, 5 is empty)\n   H(8, 5). S1(8, 6), S2(9, 6), S3(9, 5), S4(9, 4), S5(8, 4).\n4. T25: Move RIGHT/UP/LEFT? (8, 4) is S5. (9, 5) is S3. (9, 4) is S4. I cannot move right to (9, 5) or down to (8, 4). I must move UP to (8, 6) or LEFT to (7, 5).\n   Moving UP is fatal (S1 is 8, 6).\n\nWait, the calculation for safe moves needs only to check S1 (moving backwards) and the rest of the body/walls/other snakes.\n\nT24: H(8, 5). Body: (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\nSafe moves from (8, 5): DOWN (8, 4) is S5. Safe. LEFT (7, 5). RIGHT (9, 5) is S3. Fatal. UP (8, 6) is S1. Fatal.\nI must move DOWN or LEFT.\n\nIf T24 is DOWN to (8, 4) (which is an apple at (4, 5) *but I am at (8, 4)*. No apple at (8, 4)).\n4. T24: Move DOWN to (8, 4).\n   H(8, 4). S1(8, 5), S2(8, 6), S3(9, 6), S4(9, 5), S5(9, 4), S6(8, 4). **FATAL: H(8, 4) crashes into S6(8, 4)!**\nThe body shrinks from the tail, but the current body segments still exist until the move resolves. S6 = (8, 4). Moving there is fatal.\n\nThis confirms I need a larger loop that clears the body pieces completely, or target a location where the tail just vacated.\n\nSince (7, 4) just vacated, I should aim there, following the first 8-turn plan. The only initial safe move to start that rotation is UP or LEFT. UP gives more vertical space for the rotation.\n\n**Decision: Move UP.**\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T23-T29):**\nT23: LEFT to (8, 6).\nT24: LEFT to (7, 6).\nT25: DOWN to (7, 5).\nT26: DOWN to (7, 4). (Using former empty tail space)\nT27: RIGHT to (8, 4). (Using former empty S4 space)\nT28: RIGHT to (9, 4). (Using former empty S3 space)\nT29: DOWN to (9, 3). (EAT APPLE)\n\nUP",

Tail is at (2, 6).\n\nMy objective remains the proximal apple at (9, 3). As detailed in the previous rationale, the current position requires a rotation to clear the path (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3).\n\n**My previous 8-turn plan (starting from T22: UP to (9, 6)):**\nT23: LEFT to (8, 6).\nT24: LEFT to (7, 6).\nT25: DOWN to (7, 5).\nT26: DOWN to (7, 4).\nT27: RIGHT to (8, 4).\nT28: RIGHT to (9, 4).\nT29: DOWN to (9, 3).

Body: (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6).\nApples for Snake #0 are (4, 7) (dist 1) and (3, 3) (dist 5).\nSnake 0 will almost certainly move RIGHT to (4, 8) or DOWN to (3, 7).\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (4, 8): It gets closer to (4, 7).\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (3, 7): It gets closer to (3, 3).\nGiven the easy access to (4, 7) (distance 1+), Snake 0 will likely target (4, 7). If it moves RIGHT to (4, 8), it is 1 unit from (4, 7). If it moves DOWN to (3, 7), it is 2 units from (4, 7).\n\n*Prediction for #0: RIGHT to (4, 8).*\n\nThe enemy is far away from my current area (x=9) and my target (9, 3). No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n1. **Move LEFT to (8, 6):** This is the next step in the planned rotation to clear the path to (9, 3). It maintains the strategy.\n   *H(8, 6). New Body: (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2). Tail (7, 2).

(7, 3) opens.*\n   This is a relatively dead-end move unless I plan to use the very top of the board. It still keeps me safe, but delays the necessary left movement.\n\nThe planned rotation starting with LEFT to (8, 6) is the most efficient safe route to (9, 3).\n\n**Confirming the Rotation Path from T23 (Move LEFT):**\nT23: LEFT to (8, 6).

(EAT APPLE)\n\n**Safety Check for T26 Moves from (7, 5):**\n\n1. UP to (7, 6): **FATAL collision.** This is the cell S1 of my body after the move on T25. (7, 6) -> (7, 5) was the previous move.\n2.

This will result in Snake #0 being length 8. New head (4, 5). Tail stays at (2, 8) as it grew.\n\nSince my movement is far from the enemy and confined to the eastern side of the board, there is no collision risk.\n\n**Confirming the Rotation Path from T26 (Move DOWN):**\nT26: DOWN to (7, 4). H(7, 4). B: (7, 5), S(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4). Tail (8, 4). (Move confirmed)\nT27: RIGHT to (8, 4). (Tail (8, 4)). EAT APPLE. Wait, (8, 4) is currently where S7 of my body is located. If the tail moves off, (8, 4) is safe to move into.\nLet's check the body coordinates for T27:\nT27: RIGHT to (8, 4). (Tail is (8, 4)). H(8, 4). B: (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4). Tail (9, 4).\nT28: RIGHT to (9, 4). (Tail is (9, 4)). H(9, 4). B: (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5). Tail (9, 5).\nT29: DOWN to (9, 3). EAT APPLE.\n\nThe plan is sound. Proceeding with DOWN.\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note (T27 onwards):**\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 4) on T26, the subsequent moves are:\nT27: RIGHT to (8, 4). (Tail moves off (8, 4)).\nT28: RIGHT to (9, 4). (Tail moves off (9, 4)).\nT29: DOWN to (9, 3) (EAT APPLE).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9, 3) on T29, I will be at length 9.\nNew available apples are: (3, 3), (5, 0), (5, 4).\n(5, 4) is generally close. Snake 0 will likely be aiming for (5, 4) or (3, 3) next.\nIf Snake 0 eats (4, 5) on T26, it might go for (5, 4) (Dist 2) or (3, 3) (Dist 3).\nFrom (9, 3), I should proceed towards (5, 4) or perhaps (5, 0) via the bottom edge. (5, 4) is closer to me (MD 5).\n\nRevised path after T29:\nT30: LEFT to (8, 3).\nT31: LEFT to (7, 3).\nT32: LEFT to (6, 3).\nT33: UP to (6, 4).\nT34: LEFT to (5, 4). (EAT APPLE)\nThis path seems viable assuming the enemy doesn't block me or get there first.\n***\n\nDOWN",

If it ate an apple, the length should be 8 and the tail should be where the previous tail was (which was (2, 8) if its T26 tail was (2, 9) and it moved from (4, 5) to (5, 5)).\n\nLet's reconstruct Snake #0's move on T27 again:\nStart T27 Head: (4, 5). Body: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)] (Length 7).\nIf it moved RIGHT to (5, 5).\nIf (5, 5) was an apple, new Head: (5, 5). Body: [(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)]. Tail remains (2, 9). Length 8.\nIf (5, 5) was empty, new Head: (5, 5). Body: [(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)]. Tail (2, 9). Length 7. (Tail coordinate would become (2, 9) because (2, 8) is dropped).\n\nThe provided data shows: Snake #0 Apples: 7. This is the same as T27 prior to my move. This means Snake #0 did **not** eat an apple on T27, unless the score was updated between T27 and T28 data provision. Given the length 8 body provided:\nHead: (5, 5), Body: [(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)]. (Length 8).\nThis length strongly implies Snake #0 ate an apple recently. Since my current apple count is also 7, and the score hasn't changed, they must have eaten the apple *before* T27.\n\nIf Snake #0 has length 8, its tail is (2, 9). This cell (2, 9) will open up *if* it doesn't eat an apple this turn. Since it just moved from (4, 5) to (5, 5), and (5, 5) is empty on the board map, it did not eat on T27. The tail cell (2, 9) opens up this turn (T28), making the new tail (3, 9).\n\nLet's assume the provided state is correct:\nSnake 0 is at (5, 5). Body is length 8. Head (5, 5). Tail (2, 9). (2, 9) opens up if no apple is eaten.\n\n**My Plan Execution Check:**\n\nMy previous plan was:\nT27: RIGHT to (8, 4). (EXECUTED)\nT28: RIGHT to (9, 4). (TARGET MOVE)\nT29: DOWN to (9, 3) (EAT APPLE).\n\nI am now at (8, 4). The target apple (9, 3) is 1 RIGHT, 1 DOWN away.\n\n**Safety Check for T28 Moves from (8, 4):**\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1. UP to (8, 5): Safe. (8, 5) is empty.\n2. DOWN to (8, 3): Safe. (8, 3) is empty.\n3. LEFT to (7, 4): **FATAL collision.** This is S1 of my body.\n4. RIGHT to (9, 4): Safe. (9, 4) is my tail, which will move off this cell this turn.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n1. **RIGHT to (9, 4):** This continues the plan towards (9, 3).\n   H(9, 4). New Body: (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5). Tail is (9, 5). (9, 4) was occupied by the tail, which vacated it. (9, 5) opens up next turn.\n   This move is optimal for the immediate objective.\n\n2. **UP to (8, 5) or DOWN to (8, 3):** These moves deviate and delay eating (9, 3).\n\n**Enemy Snake #0 Prediction (T28 move from (5, 5)):**\n\nApples targets for Snake #0: (5, 4), (3, 3), (9, 7), (9, 3) (assuming I don't get it).\n\nTarget 1: (5, 4). MD 1. (1 DOWN). This is the closest and most threatened apple.\nTarget 2: (3, 3). MD 4. (Left 2, Down 2).\nTarget 3: (9, 7). MD 6.\n\nSnake #0 will almost certainly move DOWN to (5, 4) and eat the apple.\n\nSafe moves for Snake #0 from (5, 5):\n* UP to (5, 6): Safe.\n* DOWN to (5, 4) [Apple]: Safe.\n* LEFT to (4, 5): FATAL (S1 of Snake #0 body).\n* RIGHT to (6, 5): Safe.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (5, 4) (Apple):\nH(5, 4). Eats apple. Length 9. Tail remains (2, 9). New body: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9).\nThis gives Snake #0 8 apples, matching my current goal (7).\n\n**Collision Check (T28):**\n\nMy Head: (8, 4) -> (9, 4)\nSnake #0 Head: (5, 5) -> (5, 4) or (6, 5) or (5, 6).\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (5, 4), (9, 4) and (5, 4) are well separated. No collision risk.\nIf Snake #0 moves elsewhere, there is still no collision risk.\n\nSticking to the plan is the best strategy here.\n\n**Confirming T28 Move:** RIGHT.\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note (T29 onwards):**\n\nT29: I move DOWN to (9, 3), eating the apple. Length 9. Apples 8.\nSnake #0 likely moved to (5, 4), Length 9. Apples 8.\n\nApples remaining: (3, 3), (5, 0), (9, 7).\n\nMy position T29 (after move): (9, 3).\nSnake #0 position T29 (after move): (5, 4).\n\nNext priority for me: (9, 7) or (3, 3) or (5, 0).\n(9, 7) is 4 moves away (UP 4).\n(3, 3) is 6 moves away (LEFT 6).\n(5, 0) is 6 moves away (LEFT 4, DOWN 3).\n\nHowever, Snake 0 is perfectly positioned at (5, 4) to go for (3, 3) (LEFT 2, DOWN 1 = 3 moves) or (5, 0) (DOWN 4 = 4 moves).\n\nIt looks like Snake #0 has better access to the central apples (3, 3) and (5, 0) now.\n\nIf I aim for (5, 0): MD 6. Path: LEFT (8, 3), LEFT (7, 3), DOWN (7, 2), DOWN (7, 1), LEFT (6, 1), DOWN (5, 1). Wait, my calculation was wrong before.\n(9, 3) -> (5, 0). Dx=4, Dy=3. MD=7.\nT30: LEFT (8, 3)\nT31: LEFT (7, 3)\nT32: DOWN (7, 2)\nT33: DOWN (7, 1)\nT34: LEFT (6, 1)\nT35: LEFT (5, 1)\nT36: DOWN (5, 0). (6 moves). This path is complex due to my body segments from (9, 4) to (9, 6) blocking direct vertical movement.\n\nLet's check the route to (9, 7) from (9, 3):\nT30: UP (9, 4) (Tail (9, 5) is still occupied, but it moves off on T29, so (9, 5) is safe for T30). Wait, no.\nT29: (9, 3) H. Body: (8, 4) ... (9, 5). Tail (9, 5). Cell (9, 5) opens up on T30.\nT30: UP (9, 4). (Tail (9, 5) opens up).\nT31: UP (9, 5). (Safe because (9, 6) is S2).\nT32: UP (9, 6): FATAL (Body part). Cannot go UP directly.\n\nI must avoid my horizontal line of body segments at y=6 and y=5.\n\nRethink route from (9, 3):\nTo get to (9, 7), I need to move around the body (9, 6) and (9, 5).\nIf I move R->(9, 4), then I can't move to (9, 5) on T29 either because (9, 5) is S7.\n\nLet's recheck my T29 body path.\nT28: RIGHT to (9, 4). New body: H(9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5). Tail (9, 5).\nT29: DOWN to (9, 3) (Eat A). New body: H(9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5). Tail (9, 5).\n\nTo hit (9, 7) from (9, 3) requires:\n(9, 3) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 1) ... No, this is too long.\n\nWe must rely on the tail opening up spaces. (9, 5) opens on T30 (if no apple is eaten).\n\nIf I move:\nT30: UP to (9, 4).\nT31: UP to (9, 5). (Safe, since it opens up).\nT32: LEFT to (8, 5).\nT33: LEFT to (7, 5). (Safe, since (7, 5) is S4, and opens up on T32).\nIf T32 moves to (8, 5), T33 needs to ensure (7, 5) opens up.\nT30: UP (9, 4). Body: (9, 3)... (9, 6). Tail (9, 6).\nT31: UP (9, 5). Body: (9, 4)... (8, 6). Tail (8, 6).\nT32: UP (9, 6). FATAL. Still occupied.\n\nI cannot reach (9, 7) directly without a complicated maneuver around my thick body.\n\nI should prioritize (5, 0) or contest (3, 3). (5, 0) seems slightly safer as it's further from Snake 0's core path.\n\nPlan: Secure (9, 3) on T29. Then aim for (5, 0).\nT30: LEFT to (8, 3).\nT31: LEFT to (7, 3).\nT32: DOWN to (7, 2).\nT33: DOWN to (7, 1).\nT34: DOWN to (7, 0). (Edge)\nT35: LEFT to (6, 0).\nT36: LEFT to (5, 0). (Eat Apple)\n\nSnake #0 will most likely go for (3, 3) (MD 3 from (5, 4)) or (5, 0) (MD 4 from (5, 4)).\n(5, 4) to (3, 3): T29: LEFT (4, 4), T30: DOWN (4, 3), T31: LEFT (3, 3). (3 moves).\n(5, 4) to (5, 0): T29: DOWN (5, 3), T30: DOWN (5, 2), T31: DOWN (5, 1), T32: DOWN (5, 0). (4 moves).\n\nSnake #0 can eat (3, 3) on T31. I cannot beat this.\nSnake #0 can eat (5, 0) on T32. I can eat (5, 0) on T36. I cannot beat this.\n\nContesting (3, 3) is a definite loss. I must go for (9, 7). If Snake #0 ignores it, I get it.\n\nAlternative for (9, 7) from (9, 3):\nT30: LEFT (8, 3).\nT31: UP (8, 4).\nT32: UP (8, 5).\nT33: UP (8, 6). (FATAL! (8, 6) is S7).\n\nThe path is complex.

I need to move DOWN to eat it.\n\n**Current State Analysis (T29):**\nMy Head: (9, 4)\nMy Body (including 9, 4): [(9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)]. Length 8.\nMy Tail: (9, 5). The cell (9, 5) will be freed up if I don't eat an apple this turn.\nApple Targets: (9, 3), (3, 3), (5, 0), (9, 7), (7, 7).\n\nEnemy Snake #0 Head: (5, 4).\nEnemy Snake #0 Body: [(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)]. Length 8.\nEnemy Tail: (2, 9). (2, 9) will be freed up if Snake #0 doesn't eat an apple. Snake #0 likely ate (5, 4) last turn. Since the score update shows Snake #0 still at 8 apples, it must have been 8 before Turn 28 as well, or the score update is delayed relative to the full body length changes reported. Given the T29 board state shows '0' at (5, 4) and 'A' is not present there, Snake #0 must have moved there and eaten the apple (5, 4) on T28. Current length is 9 (8 body + head).\n\nLet's verify Snake #0 length: Head (5, 4). Body: (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9). Total 9 segments. Snake #0 must have eaten (5, 4) on T28, making current score count 9, IF the score count shown *is* the T29 score. The displayed score is 8 for Snake 0. This implies the length 9 definition includes the head, but the body list provided is 8 segments long (total length 9). I will assume Snake #0 successfully ate on T28, bringing their total score to 9, despite the provided score showing 8. This discrepancy usually occurs when the score data refers to the status before the move just completed. I will proceed assuming Snake 0 is length 9 and its head is (5, 4).\n\n**My Possible Moves from (9, 4):**\n\n1. **UP to (9, 5):** FATAL. (9, 5) is my tail segment for T29, which ONLY opens up if I *don't* eat an apple (or never opens if I move into it directly). WAIT. (9, 5) is S8 of my body. It will move off if I don't eat an apple. If I move UP, I am moving into a cell that is currently occupied.\n   My body segments: (9, 4) Head, (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5) Tail.\n   Moving UP to (9, 5) is moving into my tail (S8). Since I am not eating an apple, (9, 5) will be free *after* my move. But the moves are simultaneous. I am always safe moving into the cell that my tail is currently occupying unless I eat an apple, in which case the tail stays put.\n   Since (9, 5) is the tail, and I am not moving into an apple, (9, 5) will be vacated. **SAFE.**\n\n2. **DOWN to (9, 3):** EATS APPLE. (9, 3) is an apple. **SAFE.** (Optimal move).\n\n3. **LEFT to (8, 4):** FATAL. (8, 4) is S2 of my body (the segment immediately behind my head).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 4):** FATAL. Off board.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 29:** Moving DOWN to (9, 3) grabs an apple, increasing my score and length. This is the optimal immediate move.\n\n**Enemy Snake #0 Prediction (T29 move from (5, 4)):**\n\nSnake #0's primary targets: (3, 3), (5, 0), (7, 7), (9, 7).\n(5, 4) to (3, 3): MD 3 (L2, D1).\n(5, 4) to (5, 0): MD 4 (D4).\n(5, 4) to (7, 7): MD 5 (R2, U3).\n(5, 4) to (9, 7): MD 7 (R4, U3).\n\nSnake #0 will likely prioritize (3, 3) or (5, 0).\n\nSafe moves for Snake #0 from (5, 4):\nHead (5, 4). Body (5, 5), (4, 5)...\n* UP to (5, 5): FATAL. S1 of body.\n* DOWN to (5, 3): Safe. Empty. (Towards 5, 0).\n* LEFT to (4, 4): Safe. Empty. (Towards 3, 3).\n* RIGHT to (6, 4): Safe.

(9, 5) stays occupied.\n\nRemaining Apples: (3, 3), (5, 0), (9, 7), (7, 7).\n\nSnake #0 is likely at (4, 4) or (5, 3). Snake #0 has better access to (3, 3) and (5, 0).\n(3, 3): S0 can reach T31/T32.\n(5, 0): S0 can reach T32/T33.\n\nI am positioned far right. I should aim for the high priority apple (9, 7) or (7, 7).\n\nRoute to (9, 7) from (9, 3) is still complex due to my body segments (9, 6), (9, 5).\n(9, 3) -> (9, 4). (9, 4) is S2.

(9, 5) remains occupied after T30 because I ate an apple on T29).\n\nWait, I need to rethink the constraint caused by eating an apple.\nIf I eat A on T29 at (9, 3):\nNew Length = L + 1 = 9.\nThe tail (9, 5) remains fixed until I move again, unless I move (like T30) and don't eat.\n\nT30: Move UP to (9, 4). Safe.\nH(9, 4). Body: (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5). New Tail: (9, 5).\nT31: Move UP to (9, 5). FATAL. Still occupied by the tail.\n\nIf I cannot move up past (9, 5) because I ate an apple, I must move left.\n\nT30: LEFT (8, 3). Safe.\nT31: UP (8, 4). (Tail (9, 5) is still occupied). S0 is likely moving towards (3, 3) or (5, 0).\nT32: UP (8, 5). (8, 5) is empty.\nT33: UP (8, 6). FATAL. (8, 6) is S7.\nT34: RIGHT (9, 6). FATAL. (9, 6) is S8.\n\nBecause my snake is currently bent around the upper right corner (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), it is hard to move UP.\nMy best path for (9, 7) is waiting for the body to move off (8, 6) and (9, 6).\n\nIf I go for (7, 7) instead:\nT30: LEFT (8, 3).\nT31: UP (8, 4).\nT32: LEFT (7, 4). FATAL. S4.\nT32: UP (8, 5).\nT33: UP (8, 6). FATAL. S7.\n\nThis suggests I must focus on moving the tail segments forward before trying to access the high Y coordinates.\n\nAlternative: Loop down and around the blockage. (Risky, but unavoidable until space is cleared).\n\nLet's stick to the immediate move: DOWN to (9, 3). The future problem of getting trapped will be addressed next turn.\n\nDOWN",

I ate an apple last turn (T29).\nMy Body (Length 9): [(9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)].\nMy Tail: (9, 5). Since I ate an apple, this segment (9, 5) remains occupied for this turn (T30).\n\nEnemy Snake #0 Head: (4, 4). (Assuming Snake #0 moved LEFT from (5, 4) to (4, 4) on T29, aiming for (3, 3)).\nEnemy Snake #0 Body (Length 9): [(5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)].\nEnemy Tail: (3, 9). (3, 9) is fixed this turn if Snake #0 also ate an apple (which the score suggests they didn't, but the body length suggests they did. I will assume length 9 means (3, 9) is vacated if they *don't* eat. Given the ambiguity, I must assume $L=9$ constraints based on the provided body list.) Since the score says 8, and the body list is 8 segments long (total length 9), I will prioritize the assumption that they *did not* eat an apple on T29, and (3, 9) will be vacated.\n\nApples remaining: (3, 3), (5, 0), (9, 7), (7, 7), (0, 4). (Wait, (0, 4) is now A, not 1 as in the previous Rationale. Let's check the T30 board: (0, 4) is 'A', (9, 3) is '1' (my head). This means the apple at (9, 3) was correctly eaten.)\n\nApples list from Turn 30 input: (3, 3), (5, 0), (9, 7), (7, 7), (0, 4).\n\n**My Possible Moves from (9, 3):**\n\n1. **UP to (9, 4):** (9, 4) is the segment right behind my head (S2). This is safe.\n2. **DOWN to (9, 2):** Safe (empty cell).\n3. **LEFT to (8, 3):** Safe (empty cell).\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 3):** FATAL (Off board).\n\n**Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\nI need to aim for (9, 7) or (7, 7). My current position (9, 3) is bottlenecked by my body segments (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6). Since I ate on T29, (9, 5) is still occupied.\n\n*   If I move **UP to (9, 4)**: I advance towards the upper apples.\n    T30 H: (9, 4). Tail remains (9, 5).\n    T31: I cannot move UP to (9, 5) because the tail is still there. I would be forced LEFT to (8, 4) (S3) or to (9, 3) (S2).\n\n*   If I move **DOWN to (9, 2)**: This moves me away from the apples, but allows the body to pull away from the right edge, potentially clearing (9, 5) sooner.\n    T30 H: (9, 2). Tail remains (9, 5).\n    T31: I can move UP (9, 3) or LEFT (8, 2).\n\n*   If I move **LEFT to (8, 3)**: This is the most flexible move, moving me out of the corner towards the center apples (though S0 is closer to them) and also potentially clearing my path towards (7, 7).\n    T30 H: (8, 3). Tail remains (9, 5).\n\nThe critical goal is to clear the blockage at Y=5/6/7. Since eating an apple locks the tail position for one extra turn, I must move in a way that allows my body to shift away from the corner without locking myself into an immediate dead end.\n\nIf I move UP (9, 4), I trap myself against segments (9, 5) and (8, 4) on the next turn, with no safe forward path because (9, 5) is blocked and (8, 4) is the new S3.\n\nLet's trace the movement of the first few tail segments if I move LEFT to (8, 3) and don't eat an apple:\nT29 Body: H(9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5) [Tail].\n\nT30 Move: LEFT to (8, 3). (No apple eaten, length 9 -> 9).\nNew Body: H(8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6).\nTail is now (9, 6). (9, 5) is cleared!\n\nThis is a key realization: moving LEFT allows me to shift my serpentine body structure while clearing the immediate corner blockage at (9, 5).\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 Head at (4, 4), aiming for (3, 3) or (5, 0)):**\n\nSnake #0's safe moves from (4, 4):\nHead (4, 4). Body (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5)...\n* UP to (4, 5): FATAL. S4 of body.\n* DOWN to (4, 3): Safe. Empty. (Towards (3, 3) or (5, 0)).\n* LEFT to (3, 4): Safe. Empty. (Towards (3, 3)).\n* RIGHT to (5, 4): FATAL. S2 of body.\n\nSnake #0 will almost certainly move LEFT to (3, 4) or DOWN to (4, 3) to approach (3, 3).\nIf S0 moves LEFT (3, 4): H(3, 4). T31: Down (3, 3) (Eats apple).\nIf S0 moves DOWN (4, 3): H(4, 3). T31: Left (3, 3) (Eats apple).\n\nBoth paths suggest Snake #0 reaches (3, 3) on T31. I will assume S0 goes LEFT (3, 4) as it keeps alignment with the primary target (3, 3).\n\nNo collision risk with S0 moving to (3, 4) or (4, 3) while I move to (8, 3).\n\n**T31 Strategy if I move LEFT (8, 3) on T30:**\nH(8, 3). Tail (9, 6). Target (9, 7) or (7, 7).\n1. UP to (8, 4): Safe. (S4 segment cleared up to S3=(9, 4)).\n2. LEFT to (7, 3): Safe.\n3. RIGHT to (9, 3): Safe (S2 segment cleared).\n4. DOWN to (8, 2): Safe.\n\nIf I move UP (8, 4) on T31:\nH(8, 4). Body: (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4)... wait, the body trace needs precision.\nT30 Body: H(8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6). Tail (9, 6).\n\nIf T31 move UP (8, 5): (Assuming T31 move skips (8, 4) to make space easier. T31 must be UP to (8, 4) first.)\nT31 move UP (8, 4). Body: H(8, 4), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4)... FATAL! Moving into (8, 4) which is S4 of the T30 body.\n\nLet's re-examine the body segment positions after T30 (Left to 8, 3):\nS1 (8, 3) H\nS2 (9, 3)\nS3 (9, 4)\nS4 (8, 4) <-- Still occupied!\nS5 (7, 4)\nS6 (7, 5)\nS7 (7, 6)\nS8 (8, 6)\nS9 (9, 6) Tail.\n\nI cannot move UP to (8, 4) on T31.\n\nThis means my body structure is extremely restrictive. I must move around (8, 4) and (9, 4).\n\nT30: LEFT to (8, 3).\n\nT31 potential safe moves from (8, 3):\n*   LEFT (7, 3): Safe.\n*   DOWN (8, 2): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (9, 3): Safe (S2).\n\nIf I move LEFT (7, 3) on T31:\nS1 (7, 3) H\nS2 (8, 3)\nS3 (9, 3)\nS4 (9, 4)\nS5 (8, 4) <-- Cleared!\nS6 (7, 4)\n...\nS10 (9, 6) Tail.\n\nIf I go LEFT twice (T30: 8, 3; T31: 7, 3), then on T32 I can finally go UP to (7, 4) (S6 cleared) or UP to (7, 5) (if T31 moved UP (7, 4)).\n\nLet's combine moves towards (7, 7).\nT30: LEFT (8, 3).\nT31: LEFT (7, 3).\nT32: UP (7, 4). (7, 4) is S6. This cell needs two moves to clear if I don't eat.\nT32: UP (7, 4). (7, 4) is S6. T31 body ends at S5(8, 4). T32's head moves into a cell occupied by S6. This is safe, as S6 shifts to S7.\n\nWait, T31 body ends are: H(7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6). Tail at (8, 6).\nIf I move UP to (7, 4) on T32: (7, 4) is S6. This is safe.\nT33: UP (7, 5). (7, 5) is S7. Safe.\nT34: UP (7, 6). (7, 6) is S8. Safe.\nT35: UP (7, 7). EATS APPLE!\n\nThis 5-turn plan (L, L, U, U, U) clears the path and gets me the apple at (7, 7) by T35, assuming S0 doesn't interfere. S0 will likely grab (3, 3) by T31.\n\nSince LEFT (8, 3) on T30 keeps flexibility and is the required first step to safely maneuver the body toward the target apples, I choose LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan (T30 to T35):\nT30: LEFT (8, 3)\nT31: LEFT (7, 3)\nT32: UP (7, 4)\nT33: UP (7, 5)\nT34: UP (7, 6)\nT35: UP (7, 7) [EAT apple]\n\nLEFT",

(Assuming S0 moved down from (3, 4) to eat the apple at (3, 3) in T31, which is highly probable).\nEnemy Snake #0 Body (Length 10, due to eating): [(3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)].\nEnemy Tail: (3, 8). (If S0 ate, the tail segment (3, 8) is NOT vacated this turn (T32)).\n\nApples at: (5, 0), (9, 7), (7, 7), (0, 4), (5, 9).\n\n**Reviewing Last Turn's Plan:**\nT31: LEFT to (7, 3). (Completed)\nT32: UP to (7, 4). (Targeted)\nT33: UP to (7, 5).\nT34: UP to (7, 6).\nT35: UP to (7, 7) [EAT apple].\n\n**Current State Analysis (T32):**\nMy Head is at (7, 3).\nMy body segments are: S2=(8, 3), S3=(9, 3), S4=(9, 4), S5=(8, 4), S6=(7, 4), S7=(7, 5), S8=(7, 6), S9=(8, 6).\nThe tail segment (8, 6) will be vacated if I do not eat an apple this turn. My length is 9.\n\n**Possible Safe Moves from (7, 3):**\n\n1. **UP to (7, 4):** (7, 4) is currently where my S6 segment is located.\n   * Safety Check: Since the snake is moving forward, the segments shift. S6 will move to S7, S7 to S8, and so on. The head slot (7, 4) is safe because the segment currently occupying it (S6) will move away before the head gets there, *unless* the segment has nowhere to go or I hit a body that doesn't vacate. My current segment length is 9. If I move UP, S2=(8, 3) moves into (8, 4), S6=(7, 4) moves into (7, 5), etc. The space at (7, 4) will be occupied by the body segment that was previously at (8, 4) (S5), not by S6. Wait, let's trace the segments carefully.\n    * H: (7, 3) -> (7, 4)\n    * S2: (8, 3) -> (7, 3)\n    * S3: (9, 3) -> (8, 3)\n    * S4: (9, 4) -> (9, 3)\n    * S5: (8, 4) -> (9, 4)\n    * S6: (7, 4) -> (8, 4)\n    * S7: (7, 5) -> (7, 4)\n    * S8: (7, 6) -> (7, 5)\n    * S9 (Tail): (8, 6) -> (7, 6)\n    \n    If I move UP to (7, 4), my new S2 segment moves into (7, 3). My new H segment is (7, 4). The cell (7, 4) is currently occupied by S6. When S6 moves to (8, 4), the cell (7, 4) is vacated *before* my head reaches it, UNLESS a segment further up moves into it.\n    Wait, my snake segments listed are Head: (7, 3); Body: [S2 (8, 3), S3 (9, 3), S4 (9, 4), S5 (8, 4), S6 (7, 4), S7 (7, 5), S8 (7, 6), S9 (8, 6)].\n    \n    The segment *before* (7, 4) is (8, 4) (S5). S5 moves into (7, 4) only if I move LEFT from (8, 4), or if (8, 4) moves into (7, 4) *if I move UP from (7, 3)*.\n    \n    Let's check the flow:\n    H moves to (7, 4).\n    The cell (7, 4) must be empty *before* the segments shift, or be the cell S2 is currently in, or be the cell S9 is currently in (the tail).\n    \n    (7, 4) is S6.\n    S5 (8, 4) moves to S6's current position (7, 4) if S5 moves UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT depending on its connection. S5 (8, 4) must move into (7, 4) because (7, 4) is listed immediately after (8, 4) in the body list (Head, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6...).\n    \n    My body is: (7, 3) H -> (8, 3) S2 -> (9, 3) S3 -> (9, 4) S4 -> (8, 4) S5 -> (7, 4) S6 -> (7, 5) S7 -> (7, 6) S8 -> (8, 6) S9.\n    \n    If I move UP to (7, 4), I am moving into the cell currently occupied by S6.\n    \n    *   S5 (8, 4) moves to S6 position (7, 4).\n    *   H (7, 3) moves to H' position (7, 4).\n    \n    CRASH! S5 and H are trying to occupy (7, 4) simultaneously. This is **LETHAL**.\n    \n    Wait, I must re-read the body coordinates. The body list is ordered S2, S3, S4, ..., Tail.\n    \n    Body: [(8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6)]\n    S2: (8, 3)\n    S3: (9, 3)\n    S4: (9, 4)\n    S5: (8, 4)\n    S6: (7, 4)\n    S7: (7, 5)\n    S8: (7, 6)\n    S9 (Tail): (8, 6)\n    \n    If I move UP from H(7, 3) to (7, 4).\n    - H (7, 3) wants to move to (7, 4).\n    - S2 (8, 3) wants to move into H's old spot (7, 3).\n    - S3 (9, 3) wants to move into S2's old spot (8, 3).\n    ...\n    - S6 (7, 4) wants to move into S5's old spot (8, 4).\n    \n    S6 (7, 4) moves to (8, 4).\n    The cell (7, 4) is vacated by S6.\n    H (7, 3) moves into (7, 4).\n    \n    Yes, moving into a segment that is *not* S2 is safe, provided that segment has somewhere to move to (i.e., it doesn't try to move into another segment's spot that the other segment isn't leaving). Since the snake is moving, all segments shift down the chain. Therefore, moving into the cell occupied by any segment *except* S2 is safe, assuming the tail has space to move away, which it always does unless completely boxed in.\n    \n    Let's re-confirm the LETHAL finding from the last rationale for an earlier turn (T31) where I dismissed (8, 4) as lethal.\n    T31: H=(8, 3). Body: S2=(9, 3), S3=(9, 4), S4=(8, 4), S5=(7, 4) ...\n    Move UP to (8, 4). (8, 4) was S4. S4 moves to S3's old spot (9, 4). H moves to (8, 4). This was safe. Why did I write LETHAL?\n    *T31 Rationale Snippet:* \"1. UP to (8, 4): LETHAL. (8, 4) is occupied by my S4 segment.\"\n    Ah, I must have had a fatal misinterpretation of my snake movement rules last turn, but the resulting move LEFT was still correct for the strategy. Let's rely on the standard snake rule: Moving to the position of any segment S3 or beyond is always safe, as long as the entire chain can shift. S2 is unsafe because it is moving into the head's previous position.\n    \n    **Conclusion for (7, 4) in T32:** (7, 4) is S6. This move is **SAFE**.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 2):** Safe (empty cell).\n3. **LEFT to (6, 3):** Safe (empty cell).\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 3):** (8, 3) is S2. **LETHAL** (moving directly backwards).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\nMy goal remains to get to (7, 7). The planned move is UP to (7, 4).\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 4):** This continues the high-level plan L, U, U, U, U to eat (7, 7).\n    * New Head: (7, 4). Position: Closer to target (7, 7).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 2):** Moves away from the apple. Low priority.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 3):** Moves slightly away from the apple, but keeps options open if S0 makes an aggressive move, or if the path UP later looks complicated (which it doesn't).\n\n**Enemy Snake #0 Positioning:**\nS0 is at (3, 3) (Length 10). The current distance to the (7, 7) apple:\n*   My snake at (7, 3): 4 moves (U, U, U, U)\n*   S0 at (3, 3): 8 moves (R, R, R, R, U, U, U, U) or (U, U, U, U, R, R, R, R) (Manhattan distance 8).\n\nS0 might target (0, 4) (Manhattan 4).\nS0 might target (5, 0) (Manhattan 5).\nS0 might target (9, 7) (Manhattan 10).\nS0 might target (7, 7) (Manhattan 8).\n\nSince I am 4 moves away from (7, 7), if I commit to UP, I should secure it around T35. S0 is unlikely to intercept me this fast, unless S0 makes a highly aggressive move towards my body segments immediately, or tries to cut me off near (7, 7).\n\nIf S0 moves R to (4, 3) or U to (3, 4) (which is S2 of S0, so unsafe unless S0 is longer than 2), S0's moves are predictable if they target apples. Since S0 just ate, it might prioritize the distant (0, 4) or (5, 0).\n\nIf S0 attempts (0, 4): L, D, D, L, U (5 moves minimum, not efficient).\nIf S0 attempts (5, 0): R, R, D, D, D (5 moves).\n\nIt is most likely S0 will continue moving Right or Down to pursue other apples, or attempt to secure space. My path to (7, 7) is clear and efficient. I will continue with the planned UP move.\n\n**T33 Plan (from (7, 4)):**\nMy Head: (7, 4). S2 at (7, 3).\nT33: UP to (7, 5). (7, 5) is S7. Safe.\n\n**T34 Plan (from (7, 5)):**\nMy Head: (7, 5). S2 at (7, 4).\nT34: UP to (7, 6). (7, 6) is S8. Safe.\n\n**T35 Plan (from (7, 6)):**\nMy Head: (7, 6). S2 at (7, 5).\nT35: UP to (7, 7) [EAT]. Safe.\n\nThe plan looks solid. Execute UP.\n\n---\n*Strategy Note for Future Self:*\nContinue the ascent towards (7, 7).\nT32: UP to (7, 4) [Executed]\nT33: UP to (7, 5)\nT34: UP to (7, 6)\nT35: UP to (7, 7) [Eat]\nAfter eating (7, 7), assess trajectory for (9, 7) or (5, 9).\n---\n\nUP",
