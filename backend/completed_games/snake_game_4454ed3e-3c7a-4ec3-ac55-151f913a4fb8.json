          "move": "LEFT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's start thinking about this. The goal is to find the best move for my snake (ID 1) in this game. Let's look at the current state.\n\nMy snake's head is at (6,6), and the body is at (7,6). So the current direction would have been to the right, since the head moved from (7,6) to (6,6). Wait, no. Wait, the body is [(7,6)], so the previous head position was (7,6), and now it's at (6,6). That means the last move was LEFT. Oh right, the last move information says LEFT. So the snake is moving left from (7,6) to (6,6) in the last move. \n\nNow, the apples available are at (8,5), (7,2), (3,7), (1,1), (5,6). The apples collected so far are 1. The head is at (6,6). The enemy snake is at (8,7) with no body. \n\nThe board layout shows some apples and possibly terrain. Let me visualize the board:\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: all dots (y=9)\nRow 8: same\nRow 7: at x=3 there's an A (apple at (3,7)), and at x=8, there's a 0 (maybe snake 0's head? Wait, snake 0's head is at (8,7), which is in row 8, x=8. So in row 8, x=8 has snake 0's head. Wait the board shows:\n\nRow 7: 7 . . . A . . . 0 . \n\nSo at (3,7) is an apple (A), and (8,7) is snake 0's head (0). Then row 6 has at (5,6) an A, and (7,6) is my body (1). Wait, the board at row 6 is: \"6 . . . . . A 1 T . .\" So x=5 is an apple (A), x=6 is my head (1?), but wait, the head is at (6,6), which would be in row 6, column 6. Wait the way the board is written:\n\nEach line represents a row from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). The columns are 0-9 left to right.\n\nSo row 6 is the 7th line (since 0 is first, 1 next, etc.). Wait, maybe the board is presented in reverse order? Let me check. The first line is row 9, then 8, down to 0. So:\n\nRow 9: all dots except maybe something else? The given board state is:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . A . . . . 0 .\n6 . . . . . A 1 T . .\n5 . . . . . . . . A .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . A . .\n1 . A . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo each line starts with the row number. So row 7 has an apple at x=3 (position (3,7)), and snake 0's head at x=8 (8,7). My head is at (6,6), which is in row 6, column 6. The board shows that in row 6, column 5 is an A (apple at (5,6)), column 6 is my head (1), and column 7 is T (maybe something else, maybe terrain? Not sure, but perhaps not relevant here).\n\nSo current position (6,6). The enemies are at (8,7). So when moving, I need to avoid moving into the enemy's body, but since the enemy has no body, only head. Also, other snakes' heads might collide with my body or other snakes.\n\nThe first step is to eliminate immediately dangerous moves. Let's check each direction:\n\nCurrent head is (6,6). Possible moves: UP (y+1), DOWN (y-1), LEFT (x-1), RIGHT (x+1).\n\nCheck each direction:\n\n1. UP: (6,7). Is that safe?\n\nCheck if (6,7) is on the board. Yes, since y=7 is within 0-9.\n\nCheck if it's my own body. My body is at (7,6). So (6,7) is not part of my body. Then check if it's any other snake's body. The other snakes are snake 0, which has no body, so only head. So (6,7) is safe from that. So moving up to (6,7) is possible.\n\nBut also, when all snakes move, other snakes might move into this position. But for immediate safety, as long as (6,7) isn't occupied by any snake's head or body after the move, but since we are checking the move's own safety. Wait, the rules state that if my head moves into any snake's body (including own) or head, that's death. So when moving, I need to check if the new head position is:\n\n- Inside the board? Yes.\n\n- Not in my own body. My body after moving: current body is [ (7,6) ]. So the new head is (6,7). The new body would be [ (6,6), (7,6) ]? Wait, no. Because when the snake moves, the new head is the new position, and the body follows. So for my current move, the head moves to (6,7), the next segment (previously head) becomes (6,6), and the tail is removed? Wait, the snake's body is ordered head to tail. The current body is [(7,6)], which is the segment after the head. So when moving, the head moves to (6,7), the previous head (6,6) becomes the next body segment, and the tail remains unless we grow. Since we didn't eat an apple this turn (unless moving into an apple), but the apples collected are 1. Wait, in the current state, apples collected is 1. So if moving into an apple, we grow. But the apples are at (5,6), which is in row 6, x=5. So if I move left to (5,6), that's an apple. Let's get back to move options.\n\nSo for each direction:\n\nUP: (6,7). Check if this is safe. My body after moving would be [ (6,6), (7,6) ] (since the head moves to (6,7), the previous head becomes the next body part, and the tail is (7,6) which is now the end). Wait, no. Wait, the body is ordered head to tail. The current body is [ (7,6) ], which is the segment after the head. So when moving, the new head is (new position), then the previous head becomes the first body segment, and the tail is the last segment. Since my current body has one segment (7,6), after moving, the body would be [ (6,6) ] (since the previous head was (6,6) and the body was (7,6), but wait, no. Wait, the initial state is:\n\nHead: (6,6)\n\nBody: [(7,6)]\n\nSo the snake's body is head (6,6) followed by (7,6). So when moving left, the head moves to (5,6), and the body becomes [ (6,6) ], because each segment follows. Wait, no. Wait, when the snake moves, each segment moves into the position of the previous one. So for example, if the head moves left to (5,6), then the next segment (which was (7,6)?) No, wait, the body is [(7,6)]. So the head is at (6,6), then the next segment is (7,6). So when the head moves left to (5,6), the next segment becomes (6,6), and the tail (7,6) is dropped? Or does the entire body move? No, the snake moves by shifting each segment into the previous position. So for a snake with head at (6,6) and body [(7,6)], moving left would mean the new head is (5,6), the next segment is (6,6), and the tail (7,6) is removed? Or is the body length the same? Wait, the body length is determined by the number of apples eaten. Since we have 1 apple, the body length is 1 (head + 1 body segment). So when moving, the head moves, and the body segments follow. So the new body after moving left would be [ (6,6) ].\n\nSo for each direction:\n\nUP: new head (6,7). Body becomes [ (6,6) ].\n\nCheck if (6,7) is in any snake's body or head. The enemy snake's head is at (8,7), so no. So UP is possible.\n\nDOWN: (6,5). Check if that's safe. Also, is there an apple there? The apple at (5,6) is in row 6, x=5. So (6,5) is in row 5, x=6. The apple at (5,6) is in row 6, x=5. So (6,5) is not an apple. So moving down to (6,5) is possible.\n\nLEFT: (5,6). That's an apple. So moving left would pick up the apple. But need to check if (5,6) is safe. The apple is there. So moving left to (5,6) would result in eating the apple, growing by one. The new head is (5,6), body becomes [ (6,6) ].\n\nRIGHT: (7,6). But my body is already at (7,6). So moving right would put the head into my own body. That's a collision, so deadly. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, the next step is to see which of these moves is best. The objective is to collect apples and survive. The apples available are (5,6) (LEFT direction), (3,7) (UP is (6,7), which is not an apple. Then (8,5) is another apple but that's in row 5, x=8. (7,2) is in row 2, x=7. (1,1) is lower down.\n\nSo the closest apple is (5,6) which is one step left. So moving LEFT would collect that apple, which is good. But need to check if that move is safe.\n\nWait, moving LEFT to (5,6) is safe because:\n\n- The new head is (5,6). Is that in my body? The new body would be [6,6]. So (5,6) is not in my body. The enemy's head is at (8,7), so no. So LEFT is safe. So that's a good move because it collects an apple. However, after moving LEFT, the head is at (5,6), and the body is (6,6). Then next turn, possible moves would be...\n\nBut the immediate consideration is whether moving LEFT is safe. It is. So that's a possible move. But perhaps there's a risk. Let me check if the enemy's movement could affect this. The enemy snake is at (8,7). Their movement is unknown, but in the same turn, they will move. So if the enemy moves into (5,6), that would be a collision. But since we don't know where the enemy is moving, we can't predict that. However, the rules state that if two heads collide, both die. So if the enemy moves into (5,6), which is the new head position, then both would die. But since we can't predict the enemy's move, perhaps it's risky. However, the immediate safety of the move is that (5,6) is not occupied by any snake's body or head except the apple. So the move is safe in terms of immediate collision. So it's allowed.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT is a good choice. However, after collecting the apple, the snake grows. So the body becomes longer. But in this case, after moving LEFT, the body is (6,6). So next turn, if the head moves again, the body would follow.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,7) is safe. That position is not adjacent to any snake. Then, from there, perhaps move towards other apples. But how to decide?\n\nAnother factor is to maximize future options. For example, moving LEFT to collect the apple is good, but perhaps after that, the snake is in a position where the next moves are blocked. For example, after moving LEFT to (5,6), the next move could be LEFT again to (4,6), but if there's no apple there, but maybe towards other apples. Alternatively, moving UP might allow approaching other apples.\n\nThe other apples are (8,5), (7,2), (3,7), (1,1). The closest is (5,6) (LEFT), then (8,5) is a bit further. (3,7) is up and left. (7,2) is down and right. (1,1) is far away.\n\nSo collecting (5,6) is the closest. So moving LEFT would get that apple. However, after moving LEFT, the head is at (5,6). The body is (6,6). So next turn, possible moves from (5,6) would be:\n\nUP (5,7), DOWN (5,5), LEFT (4,6), RIGHT (6,6). But RIGHT would be back into the body (6,6), which is now the first body segment. So moving RIGHT would be invalid, as it's into own body. So that's a dead end. So after moving LEFT, the snake can't move RIGHT. So maybe that's a risk. But if we collect the apple, we grow, which could help in the long term.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,7). From there, possible moves are UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7). But (7,7) is not part of my body. However, the enemy's head is at (8,7). So if the enemy moves into (7,7), that's possible. But again, we can't know. But moving UP would take us towards (3,7) apple. For example, from (6,7), moving LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT again to (4,7), etc., but that might be a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,5). Then possible moves from there could be towards (5,6) (apple) or other directions. But perhaps not as directly towards other apples.\n\nSo the immediate apple is at (5,6), which is one step LEFT. Collecting that would be good. However, the risk is that after collecting, the snake's movement options might be limited. For example, after moving LEFT, the next move can't go RIGHT. So maybe the snake could get stuck if it needs to reverse direction. But in this case, the snake's body is (6,6), so moving RIGHT would be into the body. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,7) could be a safer move, allowing more flexibility. Let's see: after moving UP, the head is (6,7), body is (6,6). Then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), which is not an apple. Or maybe move towards (3,7). But (3,7) is three steps left. So perhaps moving LEFT from (6,7) to (5,7), then LEFT again to (4,7), etc. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is the best immediate move. But perhaps there's another consideration. The enemy snake is at (8,7). If the enemy moves towards us, could there be a collision? For example, if the enemy moves LEFT to (7,7), then our head is at (5,6) (if we moved LEFT), which is safe. But if we moved UP to (6,7), then the enemy's head is (8,7). If the enemy doesn't move, then no collision. But during the same turn, the enemy moves. So if the enemy moves into (6,7), which is our new head position, then both would die. But since we can't predict the enemy's move, we have to assume the worst. Wait, but the rules state that all snakes move simultaneously. So when choosing a move, we have to consider that other snakes are also moving. So for example, if I move LEFT to (5,6), and the enemy moves into (5,6), then both heads would collide. But since the enemy is at (8,7), moving into (5,6) would require moving 3 steps left, which is unlikely in one turn. So the chance of collision is low. So perhaps moving LEFT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy's movement is unknown, but we have to make a move that is safe regardless of their move. Wait, no. The problem is that during the same turn, all snakes move. So when making our move, we have to ensure that our new head position is not occupied by any other snake's head or body after their moves. But since we don't know their moves, we can't predict. So the only thing we can do is to avoid positions that are currently occupied by other snakes' bodies or heads. Because if another snake moves into our head's new position, that would cause a collision. But since we can't predict their move, perhaps the only way to be safe is to avoid positions that are currently occupied by other snakes' bodies or heads. Because if another snake's head moves into our new position, that's possible. But in this case, the enemy's head is at (8,7). So (5,6) is not near that. So moving LEFT to (5,6) is safe in terms of current positions. But if the enemy moves into (5,6) in their turn, then collision. However, since the enemy's movement is unknown, we can't account for that. Therefore, the safest approach is to avoid any positions that are currently occupied by other snakes' bodies or heads. Because during the same turn, other snakes can move into those positions. Wait, no. The rules state that if another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies. So if my head is at (5,6) after moving LEFT, and the enemy's head moves into (5,6) during their move, then both would die. But that's a possible scenario. However, since we can't predict the enemy's move, we have to assume that they might do that. But in the current state, the enemy is at (8,7). So the chance of them moving into (5,6) in one turn is low. So perhaps it's acceptable to take the risk.\n\nBut according to the decision process, step 2 says to eliminate any move that would immediately kill you. So \"immediately\" would be if the new head position is in your own body, or another snake's body or head. Because during the same turn, all snakes move. So the enemy's head could move into our new head position. But how can we know? Since we can't predict their move, perhaps the only way to be safe is to avoid positions that are currently occupied by other snakes' bodies or heads. Because if another snake's head is moving into our new position, that would cause a collision. But since we can't know, maybe we have to consider that as a possible risk. However, the problem says to eliminate moves that would immediately kill you. So \"immediately\" here refers to the current state. For example, if the new head position is in the enemy's current head or body, then that's an immediate collision. But since the enemy is moving, their head could move away. So perhaps the correct approach is to check if the new head position is in any snake's current body or head. Because during the same turn, other snakes are moving, but their new positions are not known. So perhaps the only way to guarantee safety is to avoid positions that are currently occupied by any snake's body or head. Because if another snake's head moves into our new position, that's possible. But since we can't predict, maybe we have to proceed under the assumption that other snakes might move into that position. However, according to the rules, the collision happens if during the same turn, two heads end up in the same cell. So if both our head and enemy's head move into (5,6), then both die. But since the enemy is at (8,7), moving into (5,6) would require moving left 3 steps. That's impossible in one turn. So the enemy's head can't reach (5,6) in one move. Therefore, moving LEFT to (5,6) is safe in terms of immediate collision. Because the enemy's head is at (8,7), which is 3 units away. So they can't reach (5,6) in one move. Therefore, the move LEFT is safe.\n\nSo the possible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nNow, among these, which is best. The LEFT move collects an apple, which is good. The UP and DOWN moves don't collect an apple. So collecting the apple is a clear advantage. So LEFT seems like the best option. But we need to check if after moving LEFT, the snake's position allows for future moves. For example, after moving LEFT to (5,6), the body is (6,6). So next move, the snake can't move RIGHT (back into body). So possible moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT. But that's still three options. So perhaps that's acceptable. Alternatively, moving UP to (6,7) allows more flexibility. Let's see:\n\nIf we move UP to (6,7), then next turn, possible moves are UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7). But RIGHT would be into (7,7), which is not part of our body. However, the enemy is at (8,7). If the enemy moves LEFT to (7,7), then (7,7) would be their head. So if I move RIGHT to (7,7), that would collide with their head. But again, we can't predict. However, moving UP might allow moving towards the apple at (3,7). For example, from (6,7), moving LEFT three times would reach (3,7). But that's three moves. Alternatively, moving LEFT from (6,7) to (5,7), then LEFT again to (4,7), etc. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,2) is in row 2, x=7. That's quite far. The apple at (8,5) is in row 5, x=8. Also not very close. The apple at (1,1) is even further.\n\nSo the closest apple is (5,6), which is one step LEFT. Collecting that is the best immediate gain. So moving LEFT would be the best choice. But wait, let me check if moving LEFT is safe. The new head is (5,6). The apple is there. So that's safe. The body after moving would be (6,6). So no collision. So that's a valid move.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy's head is at (8,7). If we move LEFT, our head is at (5,6). The enemy's head could move in any direction. For example, if they move LEFT to (7,7), then their head is at (7,7). Then, in the next turn, if I move RIGHT, I would be at (6,6), which is safe. But if they move towards me, but again, it's their choice. Since we can't predict, perhaps the best move is to collect the apple now.\n\nSo the decision is between LEFT (collect apple) and UP or DOWN. Since LEFT gives an immediate apple, which increases our score and length, making it better for future moves. However, the length increases by 1, so the body becomes longer. But since we have to avoid collisions, maybe that's a good trade-off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP to (6,7) is safer in the long run. For example, if after collecting the apple, the snake is in a position where it can't move right, but maybe that's manageable. Let's think about future moves. Suppose we move LEFT to (5,6), body is (6,6). Next turn, possible moves: UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5), LEFT (4,6). If we go UP to (5,7), then maybe towards (3,7). But that's two steps. Alternatively, if we move UP now to (6,7), then next move could be LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT again to (4,7), etc. But that's three steps. However, the apple at (3,7) is three steps left from (6,7). So moving UP would require three LEFT moves. But the apple at (5,6) is one step. So collecting that is better.\n\nSo the best immediate move is LEFT. Therefore, the answer should be LEFT.\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. I need to help my snake (ID 1) survive and collect as many apples as possible. Let's start by understanding the current board state and my snake's position.\n\nMy snake's head is at (6,6), with body segments at (5,6), (5,7), (4,7). So the direction of movement right now could be inferred from the previous move. The last move was RIGHT, so the head moved from (5,6) to (6,6) last turn. \n\nFirst, I need to check all possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to see which are safe. The goal is to eliminate moves that would cause immediate death.\n\nThe board has coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So moving DOWN would decrease the y-coordinate, and UP increases it. Let's consider each direction:\n\n1. **UP (from (6,6) to (6,7))**: Check if this position is safe. The current body parts are (5,6), (5,7), (4,7). So (6,7) is not part of my body. Also, check if any other snakes are moving into this position. The enemy snake (0) is at (4,3) head. They might move in some direction. But since they don't have a body, unless they move into (6,7), which is possible. However, since I don't know their intended move, I have to be cautious. But since their current position is (4,3), unless they move up or right, they might not reach here. But possible. Hmm, but since I can't predict their move, maybe I should avoid if there's a risk. However, the problem is that if moving to (6,7) would be into another snake's body after their movement. But since we can't know their next move, perhaps we have to assume that any collision with another snake's body in their next position would kill us. Wait, the rules say: if your head moves into any snake's body (including your own) you die. So the check is on the new position after all snakes have moved. Wait, no: the movement is simultaneous. So during the same turn, all snakes move. So if another snake's head or body moves into my head's new position after their own movement, then I die. But how do we model that? For example, if another snake's head moves into my new position, then we both die. If my head moves into their body after their movement, then I die. But since we can't predict their movement, perhaps the only sure kills are based on our own movement and current positions. Wait, the problem says \"eliminate any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body).\" So in this step, step 2, we need to check for immediate collisions based on the current positions and possible movements. Wait, no. Because the movement is simultaneous. So if I move into a position that another snake's head or body will be in after their movement, that would be a collision. But since we don't know their moves, how can we check? That's a problem. The rules state that in step 2, we must eliminate any move that would immediately kill us. So perhaps the assumption is that we can't predict other snakes' moves, so the only safe checks are against our own movement and the current positions. Wait, but that might not be accurate. For example, if another snake is moving into a position that we are moving into, but since we don't know their direction, we can't be sure. However, the problem might be considering that in step 2, we must check for collisions based on the current positions. Wait, no. Because the movement is simultaneous. So for example, if another snake is moving into a cell that I'm moving into, then both heads would collide. But since we don't know their direction, maybe we can't account for that. Therefore, perhaps in step 2, we can only check for collisions that are certain based on our own movement. For example, moving into the current body of another snake would be a collision, but if they move out of that position, maybe not. But according to the rules, the collision is based on the new positions after all movements. So if I move into a cell that another snake's body is in after their movement, then I die. But since we can't predict their movement, perhaps we can't check for that in step 2. Therefore, step 2 only considers collisions that are certain based on our move. For example, if another snake's head is currently in a position that we are moving into, but that's only if they don't move. But since they will move, maybe that's not a collision. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the step 2 checks for any collision that would occur regardless of other snakes' moves. For example, moving into my own body (including moving backward into the previous position) is a definite kill. Also, moving off the board. For other snakes, since their movement is unknown, we can't assume they will move into a position that collides with us. Therefore, in step 2, we can only eliminate moves that would definitely kill us based on our own movement. So, for example, if moving to a cell that is part of our current body (after moving) would be a collision. Or moving off the board. \n\nSo for each direction, we need to check:\n\n- Is the new position within the board (0-9 for x and y)?\n- Does the new position collide with our own body (after moving)? For example, if we move left from (6,6) to (5,6), but our body has (5,6) as a segment. Then that's a collision.\n- Does the new position collide with any other snake's current body or head? Wait, but the other snakes are moving too. So unless their new position is exactly where we are moving to, it's possible. But since we don't know their direction, we can't be sure. Therefore, perhaps in step 2, we can't check for collisions with other snakes, because their movement is unknown. Therefore, step 2 only eliminates moves that would kill us regardless of other snakes' actions. \n\nSo for each direction:\n\n1. UP: new head (6,7). Check if this is within the board. Yes. Then check if (6,7) is in our current body. Our body is [(5,6), (5,7), (4,7)]. (6,7) is not in there. So no collision with our own body. So this move is possible. However, if the enemy snake moves into (6,7), then we would collide. But since we can't predict that, perhaps this is a risk, but not an immediate kill based on step 2. So this move is considered safe for step 2.\n\n2. DOWN: new head (6,5). Check if in board. Yes. Check if (6,5) is in our body. Current body is (5,6), (5,7), (4,7). No. So safe.\n\n3. LEFT: new head (5,6). But our body has (5,6) as the first body segment. Wait, the body is [(5,6), (5,7), (4,7)]. So if I move left from (6,6) to (5,6), that's the position of the first body segment. So that's a collision with my own body. Therefore, this move is invalid. So LEFT is eliminated.\n\n4. RIGHT: new head (7,6). Check if in board. Yes. Check if (7,6) is in our body. Our body is (5,6), (5,7), (4,7). No. So safe. Also, check if moving right is allowed. The last move was RIGHT, so moving right again would be forward. But the problem says that moving directly backwards into your own body counts as hitting yourself. But moving forward is allowed. So RIGHT is allowed here.\n\nSo after step 2, the possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is eliminated because it would collide with our own body.\n\nNow step 3: among the safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), we need to choose the best one that increases chance of eating apples and keeps future options open.\n\nLooking at the apples: the remaining apples are (7,2), (1,1), (9,9), (0,4). The apples collected so far are 3, so there are 5 apples total, so 2 left? Wait, the initial list is 5 apples. The user's snake has collected 3, so 2 left. The apples are at (8,5), (7,2), (1,1), (9,9), (0,4). Wait, the apples at: (8,5), (7,2), (1,1), (9,9), (0,4). So the user's snake has collected 3, which could be any three of these. The enemy snake has 0. So the remaining apples are 2. But I don't know which ones are left. But perhaps the coordinates given are all the apples, so the user's snake has taken 3, so 2 left. \n\nThe goal is to move towards an apple, but also stay safe. Let's see where each direction would take me:\n\n- UP: (6,7). Is there an apple here? No. But maybe there's an apple nearby? The apple at (8,5) is to the right and down. The apple at (7,2) is down and left. (9,9) is far up right. (0,4) is far down left. (6,7) is up. Not near any apple. \n\n- DOWN: (6,5). The apple at (8,5) is two steps to the right. (0,4) is far left and down. (7,2) is down and left. (9,9) is up right. So (6,5) is closer to (8,5) than (6,7) is. \n\n- RIGHT: (7,6). Closer to (8,5) which is one step right and one down. So from (7,6), (8,5) is adjacent diagonally, but movement is only in four directions. So from (7,6), next move right would be (8,6), then down to (8,5). Or from (7,6), moving down would reach (7,5), then right to (8,5). \n\nSo moving RIGHT to (7,6) brings me closer to (8,5) apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,5) is also closer to (8,5) (needs two steps right). \n\nSo between UP, DOWN, RIGHT, which is better? \n\nAlso, need to consider that after moving, we need to have options in the next turn. For example, if we move right to (7,6), next turn we can go right again, or down, left, or up. But if we go right again, we might be moving towards (8,5), which is an apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,5) might allow us to then move right, right, etc. \n\nBut also, the enemy snake is at (4,3). If I move right, the enemy could move towards me. For example, if enemy moves right or up, but since their position is (4,3), moving right would take them to (5,3), which is not near my path. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's directly towards the (8,5) apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,5) is also towards (8,5), but requires two steps. \n\nBut maybe moving RIGHT is better because it's a step towards the apple. \n\nBut also, need to check if moving RIGHT would lead to a position that is safe in the next turn. For example, if I move right to (7,6), then next turn I can move right again to (8,6), which is adjacent to the apple at (8,5). Then from there, moving down to (8,5) would get the apple. \n\nBut after moving right to (7,6), the next move could be right again, but need to check if that's safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,5) would allow me to go right and right again. \n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT is better as it's a direct step towards the apple. \n\nBut also, need to consider that after moving RIGHT, the body will follow. The body after moving right would be [(6,6), (5,6), (5,7)]. Wait, the body is the previous positions. So when the head moves right to (7,6), the body segments become the previous head and the previous body. So the new body would be [ (6,6), (5,6), (5,7) ].\n\nSo in the next turn, if I move right again to (8,6), the body would be [ (7,6), (6,6), (5,6) ].\n\nBut (8,6) is adjacent to the apple at (8,5). So moving down from (8,6) to (8,5) would get the apple. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now to (7,6) seems promising. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,5) would allow me to then move right twice. \n\nBut which path is safer? Also, need to check if there are any obstacles. \n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 6 (y=6) has the head at (6,6). The apples at (8,5) is at y=5, x=8. \n\nSo moving RIGHT to (7,6) is a good step. \n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake is at (4,3). If I move right, the enemy could move towards me. For example, if enemy moves right or up, but their current position is (4,3). If they move up to (4,4), then next turn, maybe they could move right towards me. But it's not certain. However, since the enemy's head is at (4,3), and they have no body, their movement options are limited. \n\nBut since the enemy's apples are 0, maybe they are not a big threat. \n\nSo considering all this, moving RIGHT seems to be the best option. It's safe, brings me closer to the apple at (8,5), and allows future moves towards that apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN could be considered. Let's see: (6,5) is closer to (8,5) but requires two right moves. \n\nBut from (6,5), next move right to (7,5), then right to (8,5) (apple). So that's two moves. \n\nBut moving RIGHT now would get me to (7,6), then next move right to (8,6), then down to (8,5). So three moves. \n\nHmm. So moving DOWN now might be better in terms of steps to the apple. \n\nWait, but the apple is at (8,5). From (6,5), moving right twice would get to (8,5). So that's two moves. From (7,6), moving right to (8,6), then down to (8,5) is two moves. So same number of steps. \n\nBut which path is safer? \n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,5), then next move could be right to (7,5), then right to (8,5). But (7,5) and (8,5) need to be checked for safety. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (7,6), then right to (8,6), then down. \n\nBut in both cases, the path is similar. \n\nAnother factor: moving RIGHT would take me into a position where the next move could be right again, but if there's a wall or other snakes. \n\nBut in this case, the closest apple is (8,5). So moving towards that is good. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (4,3). If I move right, the enemy could move towards me. For example, if enemy moves right, up, down, or left. Their current position is (4,3). If they move right to (5,3), then next turn, they could move up or right. But unless they are moving towards my path, it's not a problem. \n\nBut since the enemy is not close to me, maybe moving right is safe. \n\nAnother thing: moving UP to (6,7) is not near any apple. So that's probably not the best choice. \n\nSo between UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nSo RIGHT seems better for reaching the apple. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (8,5) is in row 5 (y=5). So from (7,6), moving down to (7,5) would be one step towards the apple. But (7,5) is adjacent to (8,5). \n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), moving right to (8,6) and then down. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is the best immediate step. \n\nSo the possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nWhich of these is best? \n\nMaybe RIGHT is the best choice here. \n\nBut let me check if there's any other apples nearby. The other apples are (7,2), (1,1), (9,9), (0,4). \n\n(7,2) is at y=2, which is two steps below row 6. So moving DOWN twice from (6,6) would reach (6,4), which is not near (7,2). \n\nSo the closest apple is (8,5). \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT to (7,6). \n\nBut wait, let me check if moving RIGHT would allow me to reach the apple in two moves. \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,5) and then right twice. \n\nBut both paths are possible. \n\nBut since the apple is at (8,5), which is two steps to the right and one step down from current position. \n\nSo moving RIGHT first would get me closer. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first and then right. \n\nBut since the apple is at (8,5), moving right is better. \n\nAnother thing: after moving RIGHT, the next move could be RIGHT again, but then the body would be in (6,6), (5,6), (5,7). So moving right again would be safe as long as (8,6) is not occupied by another snake. But since the enemy is at (4,3), they are not near. \n\nSo moving RIGHT seems safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Okay, let me try to figure out the best move for my snake here. So, first, I need to consider all the rules and the current board state. The main thing is to not die on this turn, and then aim for an apple while keeping options open.\n\nLooking at my snake's current position: head at (8,6), body at (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). So my snake is along the x-axis from 5 to 8 at y=6. The direction I moved last was RIGHT, which makes sense since we're moving to the right. That last move might have taken me to (8,6) from (7,6) or maybe further? Wait, the current head is (8,6), and the body is (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). So the previous head must have been (7,6) when we moved right to (8,6). So each move, the head moves one cell in the chosen direction, and the body follows.\n\nNow, the apples are located at (8,5), (7,2), (1,1), (9,9), (0,4). I've collected 3 apples already, so maybe I should be aiming for the remaining ones. The closest apple might be (8,5), which is directly below my current head position. Since moving DOWN would take me to (8,5) which is an apple. But wait, I need to check if moving down is possible.\n\nLet me check the possible directions. Possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each:\n\n1. UP: From (8,6) to (8,7). Check if that's safe. The current body is at (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). So (8,7) is not part of my body. Are there any enemy snakes? Snake 0 is at (6,3) with no body. So moving up to (8,7) is safe? Also need to check if any enemy is moving into that cell. But since all snakes move simultaneously, we have to consider where others might go. However, since enemy snake 0 is at (6,3) and hasn't collected any apples, their movement might not be towards (8,7). So UP could be safe.\n\nBut is there a reason to prefer UP? Maybe not directly leading to an apple unless there's an apple there. The apple at (8,5) is below. So moving DOWN would get me there. Let's check moving DOWN first.\n\n2. DOWN: (8,6) to (8,5). That's an apple. So eating it would grow the snake by 1. But I need to check if that cell is safe. The apple is at (8,5). Are there any snakes there? The board state shows at row 8, column 5 is empty. The snake 0's head is at (6,3), so they are not near (8,5). So moving DOWN to (8,5) is a valid move, and it's an apple. That's a good candidate. But need to make sure that moving there doesn't cause a collision. Since the body is at (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), moving down would place the head at (8,5). The next body segments would be the previous head (8,6) and so on. So the new body would be (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). Wait, the new head is (8,5), then the body segments would follow. But the original body was (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). So after moving down, the new body would be the previous head (8,6), then 7,6, then 6,6, then 5,6. So the new head at (8,5) is not overlapping with any body parts. So that's safe. And since (8,5) is an apple, that's a good move. But need to check if any enemy snake is moving into that cell. Snake 0 is at (6,3) with no body. If they move in any direction, they might not reach (8,5) in one step. So this seems safe.\n\n3. LEFT: (8,6) to (7,6). But (7,6) is part of my current body. Wait, in my current body, the first segment after the head is (7,6). So moving left into (7,6) would be moving into my own body. That's a collision, so LEFT is invalid. So that's eliminated.\n\n4. RIGHT: (8,6) to (9,6). Check if that's safe. The current body is at (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). (9,6) is not part of my body. But need to check if another snake is moving there. Snake 0 is at (6,3). If they move, say, right, they might go to (7,3), but not (9,6). So RIGHT could be safe. But there's no apple at (9,6). So that's a possible move, but not immediately useful unless there's a longer-term plan.\n\nSo the possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid because it's into the body.\n\nNow, among these, DOWN gives an apple. That's a direct benefit. So maybe moving down is the best choice here. But wait, when moving down, the new head is (8,5). Then the body becomes (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). So the next moves would depend on that. But for this turn, moving down would collect the apple, which is good. But is there any risk?\n\nAnother thing to consider: when moving down, is there any chance of collision with another snake? Snake 0 is at (6,3). If they move in any direction, like up, right, etc., but their movement is independent. Since we can't predict their moves (except for the current turn), but the problem says that all snakes move simultaneously. So when I move down to (8,5), and snake 0 moves somewhere else, there's no collision unless they also move into (8,5). But snake 0's current head is at (6,3). To reach (8,5) in one move, they would need to move right two steps and up two steps, but they can only move once per turn. So snake 0 can't reach (8,5) in this turn. So moving down is safe.\n\nSo moving down would collect the apple, which is good. That would increase my apples to 4, which is a step towards the goal. Also, it's a safe move. Are there any other considerations? The rationale says to prefer moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves. Let's see: after moving down, next possible moves could be down again, but (8,4) is not an apple. Or maybe RIGHT to (9,5) if that's possible. But maybe moving down is a good immediate gain.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (8,7) might not give an apple, but maybe position for future apples. However, (8,5) is an apple, so moving down is better.\n\nAnother thing: the snake's current shape is a horizontal line from (5,6) to (8,6). If I move down to (8,5), then the next move could be left or up or down again. But if I move right to (9,6), then maybe that's a longer path but not helpful. However, there's an apple at (9,9), which is up and right from there. But that's further away.\n\nSo the immediate apple at (8,5) is the best target. So the best move is DOWN. Let me check once again if moving down is safe. The new head position is (8,5), which is not occupied by any snake's body. The enemy snake 0 is at (6,3), so their body is none. So no collision. Therefore, DOWN is the best option here.\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for my snake here. The current head is at (8,5), right? Wait, no. Wait, the last move was that the snake moved DOWN to (8,5), which was an apple. Wait, no. Wait, the last move information says that the last move was DOWN, which brought the head to (8,5). But in the current state, the head is at (8,6)? Wait, no. Wait, the current state says:\n\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (8, 5)\n  - Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)]\n\nWait, wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the head is at (8,5), and the body is (8,6), (7,6), etc. That seems like the head is at (8,5), and the next segment is (8,6), which is below the head. So the snake's last move was moving upwards, but wait, the last move was DOWN. Hmm, maybe I need to parse this correctly.\n\nWait, the last move was DOWN. The previous head position must have been (8,6), and moving down to (8,5). But according to the current state, the head is (8,5), and the body is (8,6), (7,6), etc. That makes sense. Because when you move down, the head moves down, and the body follows. So the previous head was (8,6), body was (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). Then moving down to (8,5), which is an apple. So now the head is (8,5), and the body is previous head (8,6), then 7,6, 6,6, 5,6. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the apples left to collect are (7,2), (9,9), (0,4), (1,1). Wait, the apples list shows five apples, and the user has collected 4. So one more to go. The current head is at (8,5). The possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nFirst, possible moves:\n\n1. UP: from (8,5) to (8,6). But (8,6) is part of my own body. Because the body includes (8,6). So moving up into (8,6) would be moving into my own body. That's a collision. So UP is invalid. So that's out.\n\n2. DOWN: from (8,5) to (8,4). Check if (8,4) is safe. The apple at (8,5) was already eaten, so (8,4) is empty. Are there any other snakes or bodies there? The enemy snake is at (5,3). So (8,4) is empty. So DOWN is possible. But is there an apple there? No, the remaining apples are (7,2), (9,9), (0,4), (1,1). (0,4) is an apple. So (8,4) is not an apple. So moving down would not get an apple, but is safe.\n\n3. LEFT: from (8,5) to (7,5). Check if (7,5) is safe. The body is (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). So (7,5) is not part of my body. The enemy snake is at (5,3). So (7,5) is empty. So LEFT is possible. No apple there, but maybe a path towards (7,2) which is an apple. So maybe moving left could be a step towards that.\n\n4. RIGHT: from (8,5) to (9,5). Check safety. (9,5) is empty. Enemy snake is at (5,3), so no collision. So RIGHT is possible. No apple there, but perhaps towards (9,9), but that's far.\n\nSo the possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is invalid.\n\nNow, which of these is best? The goal is to collect the remaining apple. The closest apple is (7,2) which is two steps left and three steps down from current head (8,5). Alternatively, (0,4) is far left and up. (9,9) is up and right. (1,1) is left and down.\n\nSo maybe moving LEFT towards (7,5) brings me closer to (7,2). If I move left to (7,5), then next move could be left again to (6,5), then down to (6,4), etc. But that might take multiple steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,4) might not help directly, but maybe it's a position that allows future moves. But since there's an apple at (0,4), maybe moving left is better to get towards that? Wait, (0,4) is at x=0, y=4. So from (8,5), moving left would decrease x, but y remains 5. To get to (0,4), need to go left 8 steps and down 1. That's a lot. Alternatively, (7,2) is at x=7, y=2. From (8,5), moving left three steps (to 7,5, then 6,5, then 5,5) and then down three steps. Hmm, that's a lot. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,4) is a better target. But how to reach it? It's quite far. Alternatively, maybe the next move should be LEFT to get closer to (7,2). Let me think.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7,5), then next move could be LEFT again to (6,5), then maybe DOWN to (6,4), etc. But that's multiple steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,4) might not help. But perhaps moving LEFT is better for the (7,2) apple.\n\nWait, (7,2) is at x=7, y=2. Current head is (8,5). So moving LEFT once would go to (7,5), which is two steps up (from y=5 to y=2). So that's three steps in y direction. So maybe moving LEFT is a step towards that apple. But it's still far. Alternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (8,4) isn't helpful. But maybe there's another apple nearby? No, the remaining apples are (7,2), (9,9), (0,4), (1,1). (1,1) is at x=1, y=1. That's even further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT towards (9,5) is not helpful. So between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better?\n\nThe problem is that moving DOWN doesn't directly lead to any apple, but moving LEFT brings me closer to (7,2). However, (7,2) is two steps left and three steps down from (7,5). Wait, if I move LEFT to (7,5), then next move could be DOWN to (7,4), then DOWN again to (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2). That's three moves. But each time, I have to avoid collisions. So maybe that's a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT now, then next moves could be DOWN steps. But I need to make sure that each move is safe. Also, considering that the enemy snake is at (5,3). If I move LEFT to (7,5), then next moves could be towards (7,2). But the enemy snake's position is (5,3), which is not directly conflicting. However, if the enemy snake moves, say, right, they might approach (6,3), but that's not directly conflicting with my path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (8,4) might not be helpful. But maybe there's a way to then move left. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that moving LEFT would make the snake's body follow. The new head would be (7,5), then the body would be (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6). So the body would be shifting. That's okay.\n\nBut what about the possibility of collision? For example, if I move LEFT to (7,5), is there any chance that another snake's head moves there? The enemy snake is at (5,3). If they move right, they could go to (6,3), then next turn (7,3), but that's not (7,5). So probably safe.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems better because it's a step towards (7,2). But maybe there's a better way. However, the apple at (0,4) is also a target, but it's very far. So maybe prioritizing the closer apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (9,5) could be part of a path to (9,9). But that's also far. So (9,9) is at x=9, y=9. From (8,5), moving right to (9,5) would be one step right, then up four steps. But that's a lot.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better? Since LEFT brings me closer to (7,2), which is an apple, and DOWN doesn't. So LEFT is better. But wait, the current body includes (7,6), (6,6), etc. So moving LEFT to (7,5) is safe. So that's a valid move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to get to (7,2) in two moves. For example, move LEFT then DOWN. But that's two steps. But each move is a turn. So in this turn, moving LEFT is the first step.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT. But wait, another thought: when moving LEFT to (7,5), the next body segments would be (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6). So the new body is (7,5) as head, then (8,5), then (8,6), etc. So in the next turn, if I move LEFT again to (6,5), that's possible. Then next moves could be DOWN steps. But each move has to be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is safer in the long run. But since there's an apple at (7,2), moving LEFT is a step towards that. So I think LEFT is the better choice here. So the answer should be LEFT.\nLEFT",
