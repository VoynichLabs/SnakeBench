The snake is close enough that we should avoid getting trapped by it.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- **Avoid going up** to minimize the risk of getting cornered by the green snake, especially since it is right above us. It could cut us off or trap us.\n- Aim to go for an apple at (3, 8) or (0, 4), though we should focus on **avoiding getting trapped or risking wall collision** on the way.\n\n### Next Move:\n\nGiven these observations, **the safest initial move is to go LEFT** to (5, 5).

Slightly risky due to the proximity of Snake #0 at (8, 7). If Snake #0 moves left, it could trap us against the wall.\n\t- **(3, 8)**: Requires three up and one left, but Snake #0 is directly in our vertical path.\n\t- **(0, 4)**: This requires six left moves or one down and five lefts. Long route but avoids the primary snake conflict.\n\t- **(9, 6)**: Unreachable as it's outside the grid.\n2. **Risks:**\n\t- **Snake #0 (green, head at (8, 7))** poses a risk if we try to move up. It could block or chase us into a corner. We need to maintain space to maneuver.\n\t- Moving back (to the left or down immediately) risks stalling and could trap us against the left wall or ourselves as we grow.\n3. **Goal:**\n\t- Prioritize **staying mobile and avoiding conflict with Snake #0**, while moving towards apples that don\u2019t require us to take unnecessary risks.\n\t- For now, moving **LEFT** or **DOWN** seems safer, positioning us closer to apples and keeping space between us and Snake #0.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- Evaluate the next move by analyzing Snake #0's behavior. If it moves away or stays, we have more room to advance.\n- Set our target to **(3, 8)** or **(0, 4)**, which are both apples.\n- If Snake #0 blocks us, switch to a defensive posture to avoid getting trapped.\n\n**Next Move:**\n\n- **LEFT**.
