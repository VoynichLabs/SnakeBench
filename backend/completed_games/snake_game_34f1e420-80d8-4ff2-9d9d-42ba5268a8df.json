We need to reach apples without hitting walls or enemies.\n- The closest apple seems to be the one at (2,3), but moving upward would bring us from (5,1) to (5,2), then (5,3), etc.\n- Apples at (6,4) and (6,5) are to the right but located higher. Moving right would increase x, but eventually, we need to watch the enemy at (5,5).\n\nPotential dangers:\n- Moving UP from (5,1) to (5,2) is safe, as no obstacle at (5,2).\n- From (5,2), moving UP to (5,3) is also safe.\n- Continuing UP to (5,4) is safe.\n- Moving to (5,5) would coincide with enemy snake and would cause a collision, so avoid (5,5).\n- Alternatively, moving LEFT from (5,1) to (4,1) is safe and away from enemies and apples.\n- Moving RIGHT from (5,1) to (6,1) is also safe, and from there, we might aim toward apples at (6,4) or (6,5).\n\nStrategy:\n- To optimize points, moving right seems promising because there are apples at (6,4) and (6,5). These are vertically above but can be reached with a sequence of moves.\n- Moving right initially from (5,1) to (6,1) seems safe.\n- After that, moving UP towards (6,4) or (6,5) would be efficient.\n\nTherefore, my immediate move: RIGHT.\n\nI will plan to move upward after reaching (6,1), aiming for (6,4) or (6,5), while avoiding the enemy snake at (5,5).\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**",

Moving UP into (6,3) would land on the body segment at (6,3), which is occupied, so that would cause a collision and death.\n- Moving DOWN is invalid because DOWN would take me to (6,1), which, based on the board, seems safe and unoccupied.\n- Moving LEFT would go to (5,2), which appears safe and free.\n- Moving RIGHT would go to (7,2). Let's check the safety of that, especially because apples are at (7,7) and (7,5); this might be an interesting exploratory move to get closer to those apples later.\n\nNow, considering the positions:\n- The closest apple seems to be at (6,4), which is directly above (6,3) (assuming I would move UP), but since moving UP is blocked by my own body at (6,3), I cannot go UP.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,2) is safe, and from there, I can plan to move upward or right in subsequent turns.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,2) is also safe, and potentially useful for reaching apples at higher (7,x) positions.\n\nGiven that moving UP is blocked, I should choose between LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nBetween these, moving LEFT to (5,2) allows me to stay near the current position and set up for upward movements towards apples at (3,1) or (1,7) later, perhaps exploring leftward first.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,2) would be passing the apple at (7,5) or (7,7), which are higher up, so perhaps moving RIGHT now is more strategic for future collection.\n\nAlso, I should check if moving RIGHT is safe.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,2): no obstacle at that location; no immediate threat from enemy snake at (1,6). Also, no walls or self-collision.\n\nConsidering all this, the safest and most strategic move is to go RIGHT, to open options for reaching the higher apples later and avoiding immediate collisions.\n\nNext, I will plan to move RIGHT in the next turn, as moving UP is blocked, and moving LEFT is less aligned with a future goal.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT.",

Wait, the cell (7, 0) is within bounds, but there\u2019s no obstacle there, so moving down if I'm at (7, 1) would be to (7, 0). It is within bounds. Let's check for dangers:\n  - (7, 0): the bottom row, seems free.\n  - But the previous position was at (7, 2), so moving down to (7, 1) is safe.\n  - Moving down to (7, 0): is that safe? Yes, unless there's an apple or obstacle there.\n- Moving LEFT to (6, 1): considering that (6, 1) is adjacent and safe, and I\u2019m not heading toward an apple directly, but it might help me reposition for future apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 1): which could be useful for accessing other apples or avoiding traps.\n\nChecking apples:\n\n- Apples are located at (1,7), (2,3), (7,7), (3,1), and (6,0). My current position is (7, 2), and I want to navigate towards the nearest or most accessible apple without risking collisions.\n\nGiven my current position at (7, 1), moving UP would go to (7, 2)\u2014retracting, which isn't advisable, as that\u2019s my current position. Moving UP again would go out of bounds (to (7, 2)), which is safe unless I define moving backwards as invalid. Since reversing is typically invalid, I should avoid that.\n\nCurrently, I think the safest move would be LEFT to (6, 1), as it\u2019s a free cell and could position me better for the apple at (6, 0). It also avoids immediate threats.\n\nMy next strategic goal: Approach the apple at (6, 0) by moving left to (6, 1), then down to (6, 0) on subsequent turns.\n\n**Next move: LEFT.**",

My objective is to move RIGHT to reach the apple at (7, 7) and grow to size 2 by collecting it.\n- After eating the apple, I will extend my body to (7, 7), increasing my length by one unit.\n\n### 2. **Nearest Apple Locations:**\n\n- The next closest apple after this move will be at (6, 0).\n\n### 3. **Enemy Snake Position (Snake #1):**\n\n- Snake #1 is at (3, 2) and is focused on the bottom-left area. Their body extends to (6, 2). While they are nearby, they are currently prioritizing growth in their own direction and pose no immediate threat.\n- I have a clear path to the apple at (7, 7), and there\u2019s no immediate risk from Snake #1, so I can focus on gathering the next apple efficiently.\n\n### 4. **Neighboring Snakes:**\n\n- No other snakes are nearby at this time. The board remains relatively open, and I can continue to focus on growing without interference.\n\n### 5. **Risk Assessment:**\n\n- **UP**: Moving upward would expose me to the edges of the board, which are more dangerous in the long term.\n- **LEFT**: Moving backward would delay reaching the apple, which is unnecessary given the current situation.\n- **RIGHT**: This is the best move, as it brings me directly to the apple.\n- **DOWN**: Heading downward risks approaching the bottom of the board, where escape routes are more limited.\n\n### 6. **Conclusion:**\n\n- The most efficient and safest move is **RIGHT** toward the apple at (7, 7). This ensures steady growth without taking unnecessary risks.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- After collecting the apple at (7, 7), my next target will be the apple at (6, 0). With Snake #1 focusing on the bottom-left area, I may consider using the top edge of the board for maneuvering to avoid direct conflict.\n- Keep monitoring Snake #1\u2019s movements to ensure mutual growth without confrontation.\n\n**Decided Next Move:RIGHT.**",
