Turn 0 and we\u2019re already looking at the board like a shark in the water! \ud83e\udd88\n\nLet's look at the setup! I'm sitting at **(1, 6)** and my rival is way up at **(6, 9)**. We both have 0 apples. He's way out in the corner, but we need to start claiming the center and grabbing those early picks! Look at all those apples on the left side! (0, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7)... that is basically a buffet with my name on it! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe need to grow FAST. If we get longer than him, we can start the boxing match! \ud83e\udd4a \n- **UP** takes me to (1, 7). There's an apple at (0, 7) and (2, 7). That puts me right in the mix!\n- **DOWN** takes me to (1, 5). Not bad, but we want the high ground!\n- **LEFT** takes me to (0, 6). Close to a wall, we don't want to get pinned early!\n- **RIGHT** takes me to (2, 6). Safe, but UP is more aggressive for the points!\n\nIf I go **UP**, I'm moving toward the clusters. My rival is at (6, 9), if he moves DOWN he's at (6, 8). We are nowhere near each other yet, so it's a pure race for resources! Let's secure the north-west quadrant and prepare to cut him off when he tries to migrate south! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nLet's get that first apple and start the lead! Stay focused, stay lethal! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**FUTURE STRATEGY:** Grab the apple at (2,7) or (0,7) next turn depending on where he leans. Keep an eye on his x-coordinate; if he pushes left, we meet him in the middle and SHUT. HIM. DOWN.\n\nUP",

We just moved UP to (1, 7) and look what we have here\u2014we are literally SURROUNDED by apples! (0, 7) is to our left, (2, 7) is to our right, and (3, 7) is just a hop away! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nSnake #0 (our archrival, the villain of this story!) is sitting at (6, 8). He moved DOWN to get there. He\u2019s trying to play the positioning game, but he's far away from the heavy density of fruit in the top-left! If he wants to fight us, he's gotta traverse half the board!\n\n**THE ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (1, 8):** Takes us further from the apples. No thanks, we want that gains!\n- **DOWN to (1, 6):** We just came from there. Moving back is for cowards! We gotta go forward!\n- **LEFT to (0, 7):** BOOM! That's an apple! An immediate point! We'd be at (0, 7), right against the wall. It\u2019s a bit cramped, but early growth is everything!\n- **RIGHT to (2, 7):** BOOM! Another apple! This puts us more toward the center (2, 7) and keeps us closer to the apple at (3, 7) and (3, 5). \n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI\u2019m going **RIGHT**. Why? Because it keeps us in the heart of the action! Going LEFT to (0, 7) pins us against the (0, y) wall immediately. By taking the apple at **(2, 7)**, we are still 1 step away from the apple at (3, 7) and we stay mobile to cut off Snake #0 if he tries to slide into our territory. We need to get long so we can start building the wall and trap him in the corner! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**FUTURE STRATEGY:**\nSnag (2, 7) this turn, then immediately look to grab (3, 7) or (0, 7). We want to hit a length of 3 or 4 before Snake #0 even tastes his first fruit. Once we are longer, we pivot right and start \"The Great Partition\"\u2014blocking the middle of the board so he stays hungry and we stay FED! Let's get it! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Even if they sprint right, they can\u2019t reach us in one move, so a head\u2011on collision is impossible for now.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep growing: each apple we eat adds length, making it harder for the opponent to trap us later.  \n\nWith that strategy in mind, the safest, most apple\u2011rich move is to **continue downward** and lock in a position to dominate the board.  \n\nDOWN",

You love to see it! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\nWe are at **(2, 7)**. Our body is at **(1, 7)**.\nSnake #0 is at **(6, 7)**.\nThere is an apple at **(3, 7)**\u2014right in front of us!\u2014and another at **(0, 7)** behind us.\n\n**THE MENTAL GAME:**\nSnake #0 is 4 tiles away from us. He\u2019s probably eyeing the apples at **(7, 4)** or **(6, 3)**, but he might try to be a hero and come for our lunch at **(3, 7)**. If we both move toward each other, we close the gap FAST. \n\n**THE MOVES:**\n- **UP to (2, 8):** Space is clear, but it takes us away from the immediate fruit. Why go up when we can grow?\n- **DOWN to (2, 6):** Empty space. Boring! We want that lead to widen!\n- **LEFT:** NOPE. That's our body at (1, 7). We aren't trying to eat ourselves on Turn 2! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT to (3, 7):** BOOM! Another apple! We go to length 3. This puts us at (3, 7). Snake #0 head is at (6, 7). If he moves LEFT to (5, 7), we are only 2 tiles apart. \n\n**THE STRAT:**\nWe take the apple at **(3, 7)**. This makes us longer and stronger. Since we have the score lead (1 vs 0), a head-on collision right now actually favors us if the game ended, but we want to LIVE and dominate. By taking (3, 7), we control the upper-middle. If he dares to come closer, we\u2019ll have the length to wrap him up or force him to peel away! \n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** \nSnag the apple at (3, 7) to hit 2 points! Then we look to see if he's coming aggressive. If he pushes left, we pivot DOWN toward the cluster at (3, 5) and (4, 5) to cut off the bottom half of the map. We\u2019re building a wall he can't climb! Let's get these gains! \ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 is out here with zero apples, probably crying in fountain while we take over the board! But don't get complacent\u2014this is where the real mind games start! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca8\n\n**WHERE WE AT?**\nOur head is at **(3, 7)**.\nOur body trails back to **(2, 7)** and **(1, 7)**.\nOur rival, Snake #0, is sitting at **(5, 7)**.\n\n**THE BREAKDOWN:**\nLook at the map, Chat! We are only TWO tiles away from Snake #0. If we both play aggressive and move toward each other, we collide... and since we have more apples (2 vs 0), a double-death actually gives us the WIN! \ud83c\udfc6 But we aren't just looking for a draw or a technicality\u2014we want to style on him! \n\n**THE OPTIONS:**\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 7):** This is the \"Alpha Move.\" If he moves LEFT to (4, 7) too, we BOTH blow up. Since I'm up 2-0, I win the tiebreaker if we both die this turn! But it\u2019s risky if I want to keep the stream going.\n*   **UP to (3, 8):** Safe, but keeps us in the top corner. Not enough pressure!\n*   **DOWN to (3, 6):** This is the \"Pro Gamer Move.\" There are TWO apples sitting at **(3, 5)** and **(4, 5)** just waiting for us. By moving down, we position ourselves to cut him off from the bottom of the board where all the food is dropping! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n*   **LEFT:** NOPE. We\u2019d be tasting our own tail. We don\u2019t do that here! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nSnake #0 is small. He\u2019s only one segment (the head). He's desperate. He might try to move UP or DOWN to avoid a head-on, or he might try to be a legend and collide with us. If we move **DOWN**, we create a vertical wall. If he tries to slip past us to the left, we can trap him against the wall at x=0. If he goes right, we take the center and starve him out! \n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nWe're heading for that cluster at **(3, 5)** and **(4, 5)**. We're going to use our length to zip-tie this guy into the top right corner. He has no body yet, so he's nimble, but once we get to length 4 or 5, he\u2019s going to run out of floor space REAL fast.

Body: [(3, 6), (3, 7), (2, 7)].\n*   **THE ENEMY:** Snake #0 is at (5, 5). He's only 2 tiles away from our face!\n*   **THE BOARD MAPPING:** There's an apple at (4, 5) right between us and him. There's also one at (4, 4) just below that.\n\n**THE OPTIONS:**\n*   **UP:** That leads back to our segment at (3, 6). SELF-COLLISION! We aren't throwing for the highlights, chat! \u274c\n*   **LEFT:** Moves to (2, 5). Safe, but we\u2019re giving him the center for free? ABSOLUTELY NOT. \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n*   **DOWN:** Moves to (3, 4). This is a strong play. It positions us to take the (4, 4) apple and keeps us away from a potential head-on trade if we both go for (4, 5).\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (4, 5). WE TAKE THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e If we move RIGHT to (4, 5) and he moves LEFT to (4, 5), we COLLIDE. But check the rules, boys\u2014if we both die, the snake with MORE apples wins! We have 3, he has 0. A head-on collision right now is an INSTANT DUB for us! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE CHAD STRAT:**\nWe are going **RIGHT** to **(4, 5)**. Why? Because we literally cannot lose this move! \n1. If he stays away, we eat the apple and go to length 5. The gap widens to 4-0! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. If he tries to be a hero and contests (4, 5), we collide heads. Since we are 3-0 up, the game ends and WE WIN THE SERIES! \ud83c\udf7e\n3. We are asserting dominance. We are taking the center of the board and telling him this is OUR house!\n\nLook at the apple at (4, 4)\u2014that's our next course. We\u2019re going to stay in his face, use our length to wall him off from the right side of the board, and starve him out until he has no choice but to crash into our tail! HE'S BOXED IN!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nSecure (4, 5). If we survive the turn, pivot DOWN to (4, 4) to keep the streak going. Stay on x-coordinates 4 and 5 to create a vertical wall. He is trapped in the right-side mid-lane, and we are going to make it a prison! LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "### SUMMARY of REASONING:\nThe strategy focuses on capitalizing on the current apple lead (4-0) and superior snake length to execute a \"crush\" maneuver. By assessing the board state, it's clear that moving into a space that threatens the opponent's path while securing more mass is the most dominant play. Potential collisions are weighed against the victory condition: since we lead in points, a head-on collision results in an immediate win, making aggressive positioning towards the opponent a high-reward strategy.\n\n### THE SITUATIONAL READ:\nCHAT, ARE YOU WATCHING THIS?! \ud83d\ude24 We just snagged that apple at (4, 5) and we are now a certified CHONKY snake! We are sitting at 4 apples, and Snake #0 has ZERO. Zip. Nada. \ud83e\udd21 He\u2019s just a single head at (5, 4). We are literally 5 times his size! \n\n*   **OUR POSITION:** Head at (4, 5). Body: [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (2, 7)].\n*   **THE ENEMY:** Snake #0 is at (5, 4). He's lurking right below and to the right of us.\n*   **THE BOARD MAPPING:** There's an apple at (4, 4) right below us and (1, 4) to our left.\n\n### THE OPTIONS:\n*   **UP:** Moves to (4, 6). Safe, but gives him room to breathe. We don't do \"breathing room\" on this stream! \u274c\n*   **LEFT:** Moves to (3, 5). SELF-COLLISION! That's our own body, chat. We aren't throwing for the blooper reel! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (5, 5). This is aggressive. If he moves UP to (5, 5), we collide and WE WIN because 4 > 0! But it\u2019s a bit passive if he moves elsewhere.\n*   **DOWN:** Moves to (4, 4). **BINGO!** This takes another apple, boosting us to 5-0. If he moves LEFT to (4, 4), we collide heads and WE WIN THE GAME instantly! If he moves elsewhere, we are even bigger and more dangerous.\n\n### THE CHAD STRAT:\nWe are going **DOWN** to **(4, 4)**. Why? Because we are hungry for that 5th apple and we want to sit right in his grill! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 \n1. **The Trap:** If he tries to take the (4, 4) apple, he hits us. Since we have more apples, the \"collision win\" rule secures the series for us right now. \ud83e\udd42\n2. **The Growth:** We move to length 6. He is still length 1. We can literally loop around him and there's nothing he can do.\n3. **The Wall:** By taking (4, 4), we occupy the middle, forcing him to either retreat into a corner or try a desperate move that we can easily punish.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nSecure (4, 4). After that, look to move towards (2, 4) or (1, 4) to keep the apple streak alive. If he tries to follow us, we'll use our tail to block his path. We are going to \"S-curve\" through the middle of the board to divide it in half, keeping him trapped in the bottom-right quadrant while we feast on the rest of the map. HE CAN'T HANDLE THE PRESSURE! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83c\udfc6\n\nDOWN",

Could the rival head there? Nope, safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3): yummy apple right under us! Grow, increase score, and stay far from the opponent's body. Leaves me with three open exits (5,3), (7,3), (6,2). \ud83e\udd14  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,4): tempting? No apple, but the rival could slide RIGHT into that spot \u2192 double KO. Too risky.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4): also an apple, but pushes me toward the edge and leaves my tail at (6,4) which is still close to the rival's potential moves.\n\nSo the most aggressive yet safe play is to go DOWN, snag (6,3), grow, and keep my future moves wide open. \ud83c\udfaf\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Plan: Move DOWN now to eat (6,3), grow, and stay central. Keep an eye on (7,4) for next turn.\n\nDOWN",

Body segments at (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7).

Moves us toward open space and away from the snake's current head.\n    *   **DOWN to (5, 3):** Safe! This puts us side-by-side with the enemy.

By moving to (5, 3), we are directly challenging his movement. If he tries to move into our space, he's deleted! If he fruits to the right, we are still in a prime position to cut him off from the (7, 2) and (8, 1) apples. We're playing aggressive because we have the score to back it up! He's trapped between us and the edge of the board if he's not careful. Let's get this W! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are going to stay glued to his head.

Why? Because we aren't here to play defense! By moving to (6, 2), we get closer to the apple at (7,2), but more importantly, we are getting right in his face. If he tries to come down to (7,3) or (8,4), we are right there to wall him out.

We just vacuumed up that apple at (7, 1) and we are now sitting on a MASSIVE 7-4 lead! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 Snake #0 is looking absolutely tiny compared to us! We are the GOLIATH of this 10x10 arena!\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n*   **OUR POSITION:** Head at (7, 1). Body: [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]. We are wrapping around the bottom-right corner like a boss!\n*   **THE ENEMY:** Snake #0 is at (9, 5). Body: [(8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)]. They are pinned against the right wall! \ud83e\udd21\n\n**REAL-TIME ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP to (7, 2):** NOPE! That's our own neck. We aren't about that self-sabotage life! \u274c\n*   **DOWN to (7, 0):** Safe, but it puts us against the bottom rail. We want to keep the pressure ON!\n*   **LEFT to (6, 1):** OOOOH! Look at (6, 1), chat! There's an apple right there! If we go LEFT, we snag another point AND we stay flexible in the middle-bottom of the board.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 1):** ANOTHER APPLE! This is a buffet! If we go RIGHT, we are getting closer to the enemy's tail, but we might get ourselves squeezed against the edge.\n\n**THE PRO STRAT:**\nWe have a 3-apple lead. If we collide heads, WE WIN the game because we have the higher score! \ud83e\udde0 But why end the fun now? Let's keep dominating. Snake #0 is at (9, 5). If they try to come down, they have to pass through (9, 4) or (8, 5). \n\nWe are going **RIGHT** to (8, 1)! Why? Because there is an apple at (8, 1) and another one at (9, 3). By moving RIGHT, we are occupying the space directly beneath the enemy. We are effectively building a floor that they cannot drop through without hitting us. We are going to force them to stay in that top-right corner until they run out of space and have to cry! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSnag (8, 1) this turn. Then we look at (9, 1) or (8, 2) to continue the squeeze. We are going to patrol the (X, 1) and (X, 2) lines. If the rival tries to dive for the (9, 3) apple, we'll be right there to cut them off. We are playing zone defense, and they are stuck in the corner! Let's get that 8th apple and keep the streak alive! \ud83d\udcb8\n\nRIGHT",

Both UP and DOWN keep us alive.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Eating an apple now (or next turn) raises our score from 4 \u2192 5, closing the gap to the rival\u2019s 7. Gotta keep growing!\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f LONG\u2011TERM PLAN:  \n- Drop DOWN to (9,4) \u2192 next turn claim (9,3) apple.  \n- Then sweep rightward while monitoring enemy moves.  \n- Preserve multiple safe exits (UP or LEFT) after the bite.  \n\nNow, which aggressive move seals the win? \ud83d\udca5  \n\nDOWN",

We are playing \"The Constrictor\" strategy, chat! We are closing the gap!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're going to squeeze (8, 2) this turn to maintain maximum pressure. We're watching (9, 3) closely. If they take the bait and go for that apple, we move in for the kill! We aren't just playing Snake; we're playing 4D chess while they're playing checkers! Let's get this W!\n\nUP",

The score is 8 to 5, and we have Snake #0 backed into the literal corner of the map! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 They are sweating, they are shaking, and we are just getting started!\n\n**VIBE CHECK:**\n*   **OUR HEAD:** (8, 2)\n*   **OUR BODY:** [(8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4)]\n*   **ENEMY HEAD:** (9, 3)\n*   **ENEMY BODY:** [(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4)]\n\n**SCANNIN' THE OPTIONS:**\n*   **UP (8, 3):** This is the ALPHA move, chat! Look at the board! If we go to (8, 3) and they try to move LEFT to (8, 3) as well, we COLLIDE. And guess what? We have 8 apples to their 5! If we both die, WE WIN THE GAME RIGHT THERE! \ud83c\udfc6 Even if they stay at the wall, we are building a cage they cannot escape!\n*   **DOWN (8, 1):** NOPE! That's our own neck! We aren't throwing the lead for a blooper reel! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (7, 2):** AGAIN, NO! That's another piece of our glorious, long body. We don't eat ourselves!\n*   **RIGHT (9, 2):** This is interesting, but it puts us directly below them. If we go to (9, 2), they can potentially move down to (9, 2) and trigger that collision. \n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nSnake #0 is currently at (9, 3). Their options are extremely limited. They can't go UP (9, 4) or LEFT (8, 3) without hitting a body or us! If they go DOWN to (9, 2), they are just deeper in the hole. \n\nBy moving **UP to (8, 3)**, we are essentially putting them in a \"Checkmate\" position. We are taking up the space they need to breathe! We are the wall, we are the ceiling, and we are the predator! We are keeping the pressure HIGH and the options LOW for our rival. Let's close this out and get that 10/10 performance for the highlights! \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are playing the \"Iron Curtain\" strategy. We move UP to (8, 3) to block their exit. Next, we will likely push into (8, 4) or (9, 3) to force them into the boundary or a collision. Since we lead in score, any head-on collision is a guaranteed W for the stream! Stay aggressive, stay focused!\n\nUP",

That\u2019s a head\u2011on clash we should dodge.  \n- Moving DOWN lands us on (9,2), stays safe because the rival\u2019s tempting UP move doesn\u2019t hit us, and it still leaves LEFT and DOWN as future options.  \n- Plus, even though we don\u2019t grab an apple now, we stay in a region where the next turn we can swing LEFT toward the (7,5) and (6,4) apples.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f PLAN: head DOWN now to stay alive, keep multiple safe follow\u2011ups, and set up a future LEFT\u2011upward push for those tasty apples.  \n\nDOWN",

It gives us room to breathe and watch the rival panic. \u2705\n*   **LEFT (6, 3):** **SPICY & SAFE.** This opens up the whole left side of the board for us to grab those tasty apples at (0,3) (1,4) (2,4) and more! \u2705\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nLook at Snake #0! They are at (9,1). If they move RIGHT, they hit the wall. If they move DOWN, they hit the wall. Their ONLY options are LEFT to (8,1) or UP to (9,2).\n- If they go UP to (9,2), they are just chasing their own tail in a vertical coffin.\n- If they go LEFT to (8,1), they are slamming right into our massive body at (8,1)! **THAT'S AN INSTANT ELIMINATION FOR THEM, CHAT!** \ud83d\udc80\n\nWe are going to move **UP to (7, 4)**. Why? Because it puts us in a perfect position to pivot. If they try to escape upwards along the 8-line, we are right there to headbutt them into oblivion since we have the higher score! We are playing \"The Wall\" right now. They are trapped in the 9-column and we are the gatekeepers!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe move UP to (7, 4) to maintain the \"High Ground.\" We are watching the rival's head at (9,1). They are essentially suffocating. If they somehow squirm out, we have the length to wrap around (6,4) or (7,5) and keep them boxed against the right edge. We are the kings of this lobby, and they are just a guest on our stream! Let's get that victory royale! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nUP",

They are moving into a trap we set three turns ago! \ud83e\udde0 \n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nWe move UP to (7,5). This keeps the pressure on the right side. We are watching the rival suffocate. If they try to loop around the bottom, they hit our tail. If they try to come up, we are the ceiling. Once they've exhausted their moves in that tiny 2x6 corridor, it's GG! If they somehow teleport out, we've got apples at (6,4) and (7,7) ready for the taking. We're playing chess, they're playing checkers!\n\nUP",

Snake #0 is currently at (7, 0). If they try to go UP, they hit our body at (7, 1) or (7, 2). If they try to go RIGHT, they hit (8, 0) or (8, 1). They are basically suffocating in the bottom right corner!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **DOWN:** (8, 4). This is safe! It keeps us tight and compact, but do we want to move closer to our own tail at (8, 3)? Probably not yet.\n*   **RIGHT:** (9, 5). Safe, but pushes us against the wall. We don't want to get pinned by the boundary.\n*   **UP:** (8, 6). Safe! It gives us a great view of the top of the map where some apples are starting to look juicy.\n*   **LEFT:** (7, 5). **FATAL ERROR!** That's our own neck! We don't throw for the memes, we play for the win!\n\n**THE GIGABRAIN READ:**\nChat, look at (7, 0). Snake #0 is trapped. Their only legal moves are (6, 0) or (7, 1)? Wait, (7, 1) is occupied by OUR body! (8, 0) is occupied by THEIR body! They literally only have (6, 0) or (7, 1)? NO, (7, 1) is death for them! They HAVE to go (6, 0). They are being forced to crawl along the bottom edge, away from all the resources.\n\nBy moving **UP to (8, 6)**, we keep ourselves positioned perfectly to loop back around and cut off their eventual escape to the left. We are playing the long game here. We have the score lead. If they want to survive, they have to take the long way around our massive 10-segment frame. We are the mountain they can't climb!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nMoving UP to (8, 6) keeps the center-right part of the board under our thumb. We'll watch if they try to sneak toward (0,0). If they do, we'll just descend like a predator and close the door. We're holding the high ground and the score lead. Let's stay flexible and keep the pressure on! CLIP THAT!\n\nUP",

From there, we can look at (8, 9). We are maintaining a \"vertical wall\" strategy\u2014as long as we stay on the 7-8-9 x-coords, the enemy is forced to stay in the 0-6 range.

He's trying to come up for air! His body is occupying (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), and (9, 2). He is basically trapping HIMSELF in that bottom right corner!\n*   **OUR BODY:** We've got a long tail stretching down the 7 and 8 columns. We need to be careful not to trap ourselves, but we HAVE the score lead!\n\n**THE MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP:** (8, 8). Totally safe! Puts us one step away from that juicy apple at (8, 9)! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **DOWN:** (8, 6). **FATAL ERROR!** That's our neck, chat! We don't self-destruct for the memes! \u274c\n*   **LEFT:** (7, 7). **AYO LOOK AT THIS!** There is an apple at (7, 7)! If we move LEFT, we grow to 11 apples and stay ahead of the curve! Is it safe? Our body is at (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), and (7, 1). (7, 7) is wide open! \ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\udd25\n*   **RIGHT:** (9, 7). Safe, but leads us toward the wall and away from the action. We want to be the ones dictating the pace!\n\n**THE GIGABRAIN READ:**\nSnake #0 is at (6, 1). If he moves UP, he's at (6, 2). If he moves LEFT, he's at (5, 1). He\u2019s nowhere near us yet. We have a massive opportunity to snag the apple at (7, 7) right now. By moving **LEFT**, we not only get the point, but we also create a barricade. If we occupy (7, 7), he has to go even further around to try and challenge us. We are playing keep-away and winning! \n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nWe are taking the (7, 7) apple this turn to reach 11 points! After that, we look at the apple at (8, 9). We need to watch Snake #0's ascent; if he tries to push up the 5 or 6 column, we use our length to cut him off and force him into the left wall. We are the big snake on campus! Let's get that food and keep the pressure on! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLEFT",

We aren't throwing the lead for a fail clip! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT:** (8, 8). Safe! But it puts us closer to our tail at (8, 7). Might get tight! \u27a1\ufe0f\n*   **LEFT:** (6, 8). **HYPER-AGGRESSIVE.** This move puts us directly above the enemy snake's current X-coordinate. If he tries to race up, we meet him with a head-on collision. And remember the rules, Chat? **WE HAVE 11 APPLES, HE HAS 6.** If we collide heads, HE DIES AND WE WIN THE GAME INSTANTLY because we have the higher score! \ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\udca5\n\n**LIVE STRATEGY:**\nWe have two big brain options. We can go **LEFT** to (6, 8) to start closing the net on him and dare him to hit us, or we can go **UP** to (7, 9) to play it safe and grab those top apples. \n\nBut look at the board... there's an apple at (8, 9) and (3, 9). If we go **UP**, we are 2 steps from an apple. If we go **LEFT**, we are positioning to cut him off from the entire left side of the map. He's at (6, 3). If he keeps coming up, he's walking into a trap. \n\nLet's maintain the pressure. By moving **LEFT** to (6, 8), we stay flexible. We can pivot to the apples at (3, 9) or (0, 7) while keeping our body as a massive shield that prevents him from ever escaping that bottom-right dungeon! Stay focused, stay toxic, let's get this W!\n\nPLAN: Move LEFT to dominate the center-top. Keep the body long to wall him off. If he tries to challenge us, we take the head-on collision because our score is HIGHER! 11 > 6 = victory on impact!\n\nLEFT",

He's trying to move into the center!\n*   **THE GRID:** We have a massive tail trailing behind us at (6, 8), (7, 8), etc. We are basically a wall of scales!\n\n**THE MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP (5, 9):** Totally safe. Moves us toward the top edge. There's an apple at (3, 9) and (8, 9). \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **DOWN (5, 7):** Very safe! This is the AGGRESSIVE play. It closes the gap between us and him. If we go down, we are basically saying \"I DARE YOU TO COME UP.\"\n*   **LEFT (4, 8):** Safe. Gives us tons of space on the left side to loop around.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 8):** **FATAL.** That's our neck. We don't do rookie mistakes on this stream! \u274c\n\n**THE GIGABRAIN READ:**\nLook at the apples at (5, 6) and (5, 5). He wants them SO BAD. If he moves UP to (5, 5) this turn, and we move DOWN to (5, 7), we are only one tile apart. We have 11 apples, he has 7. If we collide head-on, **WE WIN THE GAME IMMEDIATELY** because our score is higher! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n\nDo we want to take the apple board or do we want his soul? WE WANT BOTH. By moving **DOWN**, we are constricting the map. We are forcing him to either tuck tail and head into the corner or risk a head-on collision that he loses by default! We are the juggernaut! \n\n**LIVE STRATEGY:**\nWe\u2019re going **DOWN**. We're cutting off his vertical space. We're shadows in the dark, chat! If he tries to grab (5, 5) or (5, 6), we are right there to punish him. We have the length, we have the score, and we have the mental edge! Let's make him panic! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nPLAN: Move DOWN to (5, 7). This puts us on a direct collision course if he keeps heading north. We win the tie-breaker, so we play fearless!\n\nDOWN",
