The only move we can\u2019t make is UP (into our own body) or LEFT (off the board). That leaves RIGHT and DOWN.\n\n\u2022 The apples are at (0,2), (2,0), (6,8), (3,0), and (2,7). Notice that the apple at (0,2) lies directly below our current head, meaning moving DOWN will bring us closer to that apple. \n\n\u2022 The path downward (from (0,5) to (0,4)) is open and free of obstacles. The enemy snake is on the far side of the board, so there\u2019s no immediate threat from them by going DOWN.\n\nLooking at this analysis, our safest and most strategically beneficial move is to continue heading DOWN to reach the apple at (0,2).\n\nStrategy note for next turn: We\u2019ll continue on a path that leads directly toward the nearest apple while keeping an eye on our own body and the enemy snake\u2019s position.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
