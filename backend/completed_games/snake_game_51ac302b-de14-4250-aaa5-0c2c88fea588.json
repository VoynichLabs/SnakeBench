Both moves reduce the Manhattan distance to the apple to 3. However, moving **LEFT** first keeps us in the top row (y=9), where we avoid sharing the same row with Snake #0's head (at (0, 8)). This reduces immediate risks of collision or competition while making incremental progress westward. Further, moving **LEFT** allows flexibility to adjust direction in subsequent turns without overlapping with Snake #0's likely path toward the apple. Thus, **LEFT** optimizes safety and long-term maneuverability.\n\nRationale: LEFT increases eastward progress while avoiding direct alignment with Snake #0's current row (y=8), minimizing early collision risks while steering toward the closest apple.",

This is a prime position for growth because:\n   - You can move **UP** to `(0, 9)` (but `(0,9)` is off the board since y ranges from 0 to 9, so `(0,9)` is invalid\u2014this is a mistake in my initial thought. `(0,8)` is the bottom-left corner, so moving **UP** would take you to `(0,9)`, which is invalid. Wait, no: `(0,8)` is the second row from the bottom (since y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top). Moving **UP** from `(0,8)` would go to `(0,9)`, which is valid (since y=9 is the top row). But `(0,9)` is not occupied by any snake or apple.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to `(1, 8)` is safe (no snake or apple there yet).\n   - Moving **DOWN** to `(0, 7)` is safe.\n   - Moving **LEFT** to `(-1, 8)` is invalid (off the board).\n\n   Correction: `(0,8)` is the second row from the bottom (y=8), so moving **UP** goes to `(0,9)` (valid), **DOWN** to `(0,7)` (valid), **LEFT** to `(-1,8)` (invalid), and **RIGHT** to `(1,8)` (valid).\n\n2. **Apples Nearby:**\n   - `(0,5)` is directly below you (but you can't move down twice in a row, and moving down would take you to `(0,7)`, not `(0,5)`).\n   - `(0,4)` is further down.\n   - `(6,8)` is to the right of you (but far away).\n   - `(5,1)` and `(6,4)` are far away.\n\n   The closest apple is `(0,5)`, but you can't reach it in one move. The next closest is `(0,4)` or `(6,8)`. `(6,8)` is reachable in one move if you go **RIGHT** to `(1,8)`, then **RIGHT** again to `(2,8)`, etc., but that's not immediate. Alternatively, `(0,5)` is reachable by moving **DOWN** to `(0,7)`, then **DOWN** to `(0,6)`, then **DOWN** to `(0,5)`. But that's three moves away.\n\n   Wait, no: `(0,5)` is directly below you if you move **DOWN** repeatedly. But you can't move down twice in a row (that would be moving into your own body if you had length > 1, but you don't yet). So you'd need to move **DOWN** once to `(0,7)`, then turn to avoid going into your own body (but you don't have a body yet, so no issue). But the apple is at `(0,5)`, which is three moves down, so you'd need to plan ahead.\n\n   Alternatively, `(6,8)` is reachable by moving **RIGHT** to `(1,8)`, then **RIGHT** to `(2,8)`, etc., but that's also not immediate.\n\n   The closest apple is `(0,5)`, but it's not reachable in one move. The next closest is `(0,4)` or `(6,8)`. `(6,8)` is reachable in one move if you go **RIGHT** to `(1,8)`, then **RIGHT** to `(2,8)`, etc., but that's not immediate. Alternatively, `(0,4)` is reachable by moving **DOWN** to `(0,7)`, then **DOWN** to `(0,6)`, then **DOWN** to `(0,5)`, then **DOWN** to `(0,4)`. But that's four moves away.\n\n   Wait, no: `(0,5)` is at y=5, and you're at y=8. Moving **DOWN** decreases y, so `(0,8)` -> `(0,7)` -> `(0,6)` -> `(0,5)`. So `(0,5)` is three moves down.\n\n   The other apples are farther away. So the best immediate apple is `(0,5)`, but it's not reachable in one move. The next best is `(6,8)`, which is reachable by moving **RIGHT** to `(1,8)`, then **RIGHT** to `(2,8)`, etc., but that's not immediate.\n\n   Alternatively, `(0,4)` is reachable by moving **DOWN** to `(0,7)`, then **DOWN** to `(0,6)`, then **DOWN** to `(0,5)`, then **DOWN** to `(0,4)`.

Snake #1 cannot block us in one move unless they move **UP** to (6, 7) or **RIGHT** to (7, 6), but we\u2019ll monitor their next move.\n2. **Avoid Snake #1\u2019s potential blocking**: If Snake #1 moves **UP** to (6, 7), they could block our path to (6, 8) if we move **RIGHT** to (6, 8) simultaneously. However, since Snake #1\u2019s body is at (6, 7), moving **UP** would place their head at (6, 7), which is already occupied by their body. This means Snake #1 cannot move **UP** to (6, 7) without dying. Thus, their only viable blocking move is **RIGHT** to (7, 6), which would not block us directly. We\u2019ll proceed with **RIGHT** to (6, 8) safely.\n3. **Expand toward the center**: After reaching (6, 8), we\u2019ll pivot toward (6, 4) or (5, 1) to maximize apple collection. The center has multiple apples and offers growth opportunities.\n\n**Future Moves (Next 3 Turns):**\n- **Turn 3**: Move **RIGHT** to (6, 8) to eat the apple.\n- **Turn 4**: If we\u2019ve eaten the apple at (6, 8), pivot **DOWN** to (6, 7) or **LEFT** to (6, 6) to explore other apples (e.g., (6, 4) or (5, 1)).\n- **Turn 5+**: If Snake #1 moves aggressively, prioritize **LEFT** or **DOWN** to avoid collisions while still targeting apples.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- **Enemy Movement**: Snake #1 cannot move **UP** to (6, 7) without dying, so their only viable blocking move is **RIGHT** to (7, 6), which does not block us. We\u2019ll proceed with **RIGHT** to (6, 8).\n- **Self-Collision**: No risk yet since we\u2019re a single segment. If we grow, we\u2019ll avoid moving backward into our tail.\n\n**Apple Prioritization:**\nOrder of preference for apples:\n1. (6, 8) \u2013 Closest and safest.\n2. (6, 4) \u2013 Can be reached after (6, 8).\n3. (5, 1) \u2013 Requires more complex path but worth targeting if (6, 8) is gone.\n4.

If Snake #1 does not move, this is safe.\n  - **RIGHT**: (7, 8) \u2013 Moves toward the edge of the board (invalid).\n  - **LEFT**: (5, 8) \u2013 Moves back toward (5, 8), which is not optimal.\n\n- **Enemy Analysis**:\n  - Snake #1 is at (6, 6) with body at (6, 7). If Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to (7, 6), they could block our path to (6, 4) or (5, 1) in the future. However, their current position does not block our move to (6, 8) or (6, 7).\n  - If we move **DOWN** to (6, 7), Snake #1 cannot move into (6, 7) without dying, so this is safe.\n\n- **Best Move**: **DOWN** to (6, 7) to avoid moving toward the edge and to position ourselves for future moves toward (6, 4) or (5, 1).
