We are LIVE and ready to box this archrival in! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current State:**\n- Me (Snake 0): Head at (0, 8), length 1 (no body)\n- Enemy (Snake 1): Head at (0, 1), length 1 (no body)\n- Apples are scattered everywhere\n- We are on Turn 0 with 150 turns to go\n\n**Quick Assessment:**\nEnemy is at (0, 1) - way down low. I'm at (0, 8) - almost at the top row (y=9). Apples nearby: (0, 6) is close, (0, 4) is also nearby vertically. (9, 3) is way across. (4, 9) is at the top row.\n\n**Analysis of possible moves from (0,8):**\n- **UP:** To (0, 9) - That's valid! (0,9) is inside board, no body there.\n- **RIGHT:** To (1, 8) - Valid, but open space.\n- **DOWN:** To (0, 7) - Valid, but might bring us closer to enemy's future path.\n- **LEFT:** To (-1, 8) - OUT OF BOARD! Dead instantly. NO.\n\nSo LEFT is fatal. Eliminate.\n\n**Now we evaluate UP, RIGHT, DOWN for safety and strategy:**\n\nEnemy is far away at (0,1). He can move UP (0,2), RIGHT (1,1), or DOWN (0,0). He might go for the apples near him: (0,4) is up, (0,6) is up, but he's at y=1. He can't reach (0,6) or (0,4) in one turn. The apples closest to him are (0,4) (3 steps away), (1,2) (2 steps), (0,6) (5 steps). He will likely move UP or RIGHT.\n\n**My potential moves:**\n\n1. **UP to (0,9):** This is the top edge. From there, I can only go DOWN, LEFT (off board), or RIGHT next turn. LEFT is out. So from (0,9) I would have only 2 safe moves (DOWN or RIGHT) unless I eat an apple. There is no apple at (0,9) currently. This limits my options and could trap me against the wall. Being at the wall reduces mobility. Not ideal for early game positioning.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (1,8):** Opens up more space. From (1,8), I can go UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7), RIGHT (2,8), or LEFT (0,8). All four directions are valid (assuming no immediate collision). This keeps options open. Also, (1,8) is closer to some apples? Let's see: (1,3) is far south, (2,0) far south. Not immediate. But spatially, moving center gives flexibility.\n\n3. **DOWN to (0,7):** Goes toward the middle. From (0,7), similar to (0,9), I'd be on the edge. Options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is out. So still limited to 3 options. Also, moving down brings me slightly closer to the enemy who is at (0,1). He might move up. While collision isn't immediate (he'd have to get to y=7+...), keeping distance is generally safer. Also, (0,7) doesn't have an apple (apple at 0,6 is one step down from there, but not on the cell).\n\n**Strategy:**\nEarly game, mobility is king. Being on the edge limits future moves. Being in the open (like (1,8)) maximizes options. Also, we want to dominate the board. Starting by moving toward the center (even just one step right) is better than hugging the wall.\n\n**Head-on collision check:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,8) and Enemy goes UP to (0,2), no collision. If Enemy goes RIGHT to (1,1), no collision. Distance is safe.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,9) and Enemy goes UP to (0,2), no collision.\nIf I go DOWN to (0,7) and Enemy goes UP to (0,2), no collision.\n\nSafety is fine for all. But mobility is the deciding factor.\n\n**Verdict:**\nRIGHT is the move. It opens up the board, avoids early wall trapping, and keeps our future options flexible. We aren't hungry for a specific apple yet; we are hunting the enemy eventually. First, establish presence.\n\n**Rationale/Plan for future self:**\n\"Turn 0: Moving RIGHT to (1,8) to increase spatial mobility and avoid early wall trap at (0,9). Prioritizing board control and keeping options open over chasing distant apples. Enemy is far south, no immediate threat. Watch for enemy moving up; we maintain distance. Goal: Expand territory.\"\n\n**Final Move:**\nRIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Let's map this out.\n\n**Board Check:**\n- Me: Head at (1, 8) after last turn. Body: none. Apples: 0.\n- Enemy: Head at (1, 1). Body: none. Apples: 0.\n- Apples: (9, 3), (0, 6), (4, 9), (7, 0), (4, 1), (3, 0), (6, 5), (4, 2), (2, 0), (1, 2), (9, 6), (1, 3), (8, 5), (8, 2), (0, 4).\n\n**Current Position Analysis (1,8):**\nI am currently on the left side of the board but higher up. From (1,8), I have options:\n- **UP:** To (1, 9). That's the top wall. Wall play is dangerous if you get trapped.\n- **DOWN:** To (1, 7). Safe. Open space.\n- **LEFT:** To (0, 8). Back to the wall. Even more restricted than before.\n- **RIGHT:** To (2, 8). Moving central. Open space.\n\n**Enemy Analysis (1,1):**\nEnemy is near the bottom left. There are apples at (1,2) and (1,3) directly above him.\n- If he moves UP (to 1,2), he eats the apple. That's the smart play.\n- If he moves UP (to 1,2), he is at y=2.\n- If I move UP (to 1,9), I am at y=9.\n- If I move DOWN (to 1,7), I am at y=7.\n- If I move RIGHT (to 2,8), I am at y=8.\n\n**Collision Risk:**\nIf I go **UP** to (1,9) and he goes **UP** to (1,2), no collision. Distance is huge.\nIf I go **DOWN** to (1,7) and he goes **UP** to (1,2), no collision.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (2,8) and he goes **UP** to (1,2), no collision.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (0,8) and he goes **UP** to (1,2), no collision.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n- **LEFT (0,8):** I just came from there. It's a dead end against the wall. Low mobility.\n- **UP (1,9):** Hitting the top wall. Low mobility. Hard to escape if I get crowded. I want to avoid walls early on.\n- **DOWN (1,7):** Keeps me on the left side. The enemy is on the left side (x=1). If I stay at x=0 or x=1, I am in his \"lane\". He is growing up. I should probably move out of his lane to avoid future boxing in.\n- **RIGHT (2,8):** This moves me toward the center of the board (x=2). Center control is key for long-term survival. From the center, I can access apples in all directions.\n\n**Plan:**\nThe goal is to dominate the board. Being in the center allows for better control. The enemy is bottom-left. I will move to the center (RIGHT). I will not chase the apples immediately; I will secure position.\n\n**Move Choice:**\nRIGHT is the best move for board control and avoiding walls/lanes.\n\n**RIGHT**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is at (1,2) and just ate an apple, growing his tail to (1,2). Wait, actually looking at the board state again: Enemy #1 Head at (1,2), Body at [(1,1)]. The apple at (1,2) is gone. He is currently at length 2.\n\nI am at (2,8) with length 1.\n\n**Board Check:**\nMy current position: (2,8).\nAvailable moves:\n- **UP (2,9)**: Top wall. Dead end soon.\n- **DOWN (2,7)**: Open space.\n- **LEFT (1,8)**: My previous position, empty.\n- **RIGHT (3,8)**: Open space.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy at (1,2). Apples at (1,3) and (2,0) and (0,4) nearby.\nIf he moves **UP**, he heads to (1,3) (Apple).\nIf he moves **RIGHT**, he heads to (2,2) (Empty).\nIf he moves **DOWN**, he heads to (1,1) (His own body - DEATH).\nIf he moves **LEFT**, he heads to (0,2) (Empty).\n\nHe cannot move DOWN because he would hit his own tail at (1,1). He wants apples, so he will likely go UP to (1,3) or possibly LEFT/RIGHT. (1,3) is a high-value target.\n\n**My Strategy:**\nI need to avoid the top wall (UP is bad). I need to avoid boxing myself in.\nLeft (1,8) takes me back to where I came from, limiting my options.\nRight (3,8) and Down (2,7) are the best for expansion.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (2,7), I stay central/left but lower down. If I go **RIGHT** to (3,8), I move more central and keep my vertical axis open.\nFrom (3,8), I have access to the center and can react to the enemy's movement. The enemy is on the far left (x=1). If I go Right, I am x=3, creating distance.\n\nLong-term plan: Secure the center/right side. The enemy is cornering himself on the left wall with that apple cluster. I will take the open board.\n\n**Move Choice:**\n**RIGHT** is the move. It opens up the board and avoids the wall.\n\n**RIGHT**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

I gotta close that gap fast. But remember the rules: we play AGGRESSIVE. We box him in.\n\n**Current Status:**\n*   **My Head:** (3, 8)\n*   **My Body:** None (Length 1)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (1, 3)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(1, 2), (1, 1)] (Length 3)\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nThe enemy is at (1, 3). From that position, what are his immediate threats to ME?\nIf he moves **RIGHT**, he hits (2, 3).\nIf he moves **UP**, he hits (1, 4).\nIf he moves **DOWN**, he hits (1, 2) \u2013 his own body. He can't do that.\nIf he moves **LEFT**, he hits (0, 3).\n\nWait. Look at my current head: **(3, 8)**.\nThe enemy is at x=1. We are far apart vertically (y=8 vs y=3) and horizontally (x=3 vs x=1).\n\nHowever, I must check for **HEAD-ON COLLISIONS**.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (3, 7): Is the enemy moving to (3, 7)? No, he's at x=1. Impossible.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (2, 8): Is the enemy moving to (2, 8)? No, he's at x=1. Impossible.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (4, 8): No.\nIf I move **UP** to (3, 9): No.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n1.  **UP (3, 9):** Valid coordinate. Empty. Not hitting myself.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 7):** Valid coordinate. Empty. Not hitting myself.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 8):** Valid coordinate. Empty. Not hitting myself.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 8):** Valid coordinate. Empty. Not hitting myself.\n\nAll moves are technically \"safe\" from immediate death this turn.\n\n**Strategy & Apple Hunting:**\nI need to dominate the board. The enemy is anchored to the left side (x=0, x=1).\nApple at **(4, 9)** is close. Apple at **(4, 2)** is far down.\nApple at **(9, 3)** is all the way right.\n\nIf I go **UP** to (3, 9):\nI am literally one step away from the apple at (4, 9). From (3, 9), I can easily pivot to (4, 9) next turn.\nBUT... (3, 9) is the top row (y=9). Top row is dangerous because I have no \"Up\" escape next turn. It limits my future options.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (4, 8):\nI am moving closer to the center/right side. From (4, 8), I can go to (4, 9) or (5, 8) next turn. This keeps my options more open than being stuck on the wall.\nAlso, look at the apple at (7, 7). That's a juicy target.\nIf I go RIGHT, I start claiming the right side of the board while the enemy is stuck on the left.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (3, 7):\nI head towards the center. Apple at (7, 7) is to the right. Apple at (4, 9) is far away. I'm moving away from the immediate apple cluster at the top.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (2, 8):\nI move back toward the left side where the enemy is. I don't want to constrict myself near him. I want space.\n\n**The Play:**\nI want to claim the right side.\n**RIGHT (4, 8)** is the move.\nWhy?\n1.  It moves me away from the enemy (who is at x=1).\n2.  It opens up the path to (5,8), (6,8), (7,7), (7,0), and the right-side apples.\n3.  It avoids the top wall, keeping my movement fluid.\n4.  It forces the enemy to react to my positioning on the right.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMove RIGHT. Establish dominance on the right flank.\n\n**RIGHT**",

I want to claim the right side.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 8):** This moves me closer to the juicy apples on the right (like the one at (7,7)) and away from the enemy.\n\nLet's check for immediate threats. Enemy head is at (0, 3). His body is at (1,3) and (1,2).\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 8):\n1.  **Off Board?** No.\n2.  **Self Collision?** No body yet.\n3.  **Enemy Body?** No, he's on the other side of the map (x=0,1 vs my x=5).\n4.  **Head-on Collision?** The enemy would have to move to (5, 8) to kill me.

Impossible from (0,3).\nAlso safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 7): Also safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 8): Also safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am at 0 apples. He is at 2. I need to eat. The closest apple is at **(4, 9)**. I am at (4, 8).\nIf I go **UP**, I eat the apple immediately. That brings me to 1 apple.\nBUT... being at (4, 9) puts me on the top wall.

Be aggressive... Dominate the board.\"\nThe enemy is on the LEFT (x=0). I should take the RIGHT (x=9).\nHowever, I am literally standing under an apple. Ignoring a guaranteed score to run across the map might be inefficient.\nBUT, getting stuck on the wall (4,9) is risky. If the enemy gets lucky and I get trapped, I die.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\n(4, 9) is an apple.\n(5, 8) is empty.\nIf I go UP to (4, 9), I eat. Then next turn, I can only go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 8), I don't eat. But I control the space.\n\nWait, look at the apple at **(7, 7)**. That is diagonally adjacent to me if I move Right/Down.\nIf I go **RIGHT** now, I can potentially arc towards (7, 7) or (8, 5).\nIf I go **UP** now, I am stuck at the top. I would have to come back down eventually.\n\nThe prompt emphasizes: \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI currently have a LOWER score (0 vs 2). I shouldn't force a head-on collision yet. I need to grow.\nBut \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nDominating the board means controlling space. The enemy is on the left. I should take the right.\nIf I take the right, I split the board. I am safe from the left-side enemy.\n\nLet's check safety of **RIGHT** one more time.\nHead: (4,8) -> (5,8).\nValid. Empty. No enemies nearby.\nThis sets me up to go for the apple at (7,7) or (8,5) or (9,3).\nIt keeps my options open.\n\nIf I go UP to (4,9), I eat.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,8), I don't eat.\nIs one turn of starvation worth better positioning? Yes. Being on the wall is bad.\nIf I go UP, I might be forced to move LEFT (3,9) or DOWN (4,8) or RIGHT (5,9).\n(5,9) is a corner. (3,9) is the top wall. (4,8) is where I am now.\nIt's a squeeze.\n\nLet's go **RIGHT**.\nWhy? Because I want to claim the right side. The enemy is on the left.\nThe apple at (7,7) is very tempting.\nFrom (5,8), I can go to (6,8), (7,8), or (7,7).\nThis is a power play. I ignore the small apple to secure the territory.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nApple at (4, 9).\nApple at (4, 1).\nApple at (7, 0).\nApple at (6, 5).\nApple at (7, 7).\nApple at (9, 6).\nApple at (8, 5).\nApple at (8, 2).\nApple at (9, 3).\n\nThere are SO MANY apples on the right side.\nThe enemy is at x=0.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving towards a feast.\nIf I go UP, I am moving towards a wall.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMove RIGHT. Secure the right flank. The apple at (4,9) is a trap (wall). I need fluidity.\n\n**RIGHT**",

Let's analyze the board state for Turn 5.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (5, 8), Length 1 (Tail is currently (5, 8) as well since I haven't eaten). Apples: 0.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (0, 4), Body at (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2). Apples: 3. He is on the far LEFT side, moving South.\n*   **Scoreboard:** I am down 0-3. I need to eat FAST to catch up.\n*   **Apples:** There is an apple at **(4, 9)**. It is directly UP from me at (5, 8).\n    *   Distance: 1 move.\n    *   Coordinates: (5, 8) -> (4, 9).\n*   **Board Dynamics:** The enemy is at x=0. I am at x=5. The center and right side (x=6-9) are ripe for the taking. By moving UP to (4, 9), I grab the apple immediately. This is crucial because I am currently tied for last place (0 apples) against an opponent with 3.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (Moving UP to (4, 9)):**\n1.  **Off Board?** No. (4, 9) is valid (top row).\n2.  **Self Collision?** No. My body is currently just my previous head position at (5, 8), which is not (4, 9).\n3.  **Enemy Body?** No. Enemy is at x=0, I am at x=4. Safe distance.\n4.  **Head-on Collision?** Enemy is at (0, 4) moving away or potentially towards apples on the left side (like 0,6 or 0,3? Wait, he's at 0,4). He cannot reach (4, 9) in one turn. Safe.\n5.  **Trapping myself?** (4, 9) is on the top wall. However, looking at the board, I will have options:\n    *   **LEFT** to (3, 9) - Open.\n    *   **RIGHT** to (5, 9) - Open.\n    *   **DOWN** to (4, 8) - Open (my previous spot).\n    *   **UP** is blocked by wall.\n    *   I am NOT trapped. I have 3 safe moves after eating.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\n\"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nI am currently losing 0-3. The priority is **SURVIVAL** and **CATCHING UP**.\nThe apple at (4, 9) is the closest guaranteed point. I need to close the score gap immediately to put pressure on the enemy. Once I have points, I can start forcing head-on collisions. Right now, I'm just a small snake trying to get big.\n\nI will move **UP** to eat the apple at (4, 9). This secures my first point and sets me on the path to the right side where the majority of the apples are located (7,7, 8,5, 9,6, etc.).\n\nLet's get this bread!\n\nUP",

The board shows `.` (empty).\n        *   The cell to my LEFT is (3,8). The board shows `.` (empty).\n\n        *   **Apple at (4, 8)?** No, the board shows `0`.\n        *   **Apple at (4, 9)?** The board shows `T` (my tail).\n        *   **Apple at (3, 9)?** The board shows `.` (empty).\n        *   **Apple at (5, 9)?** The board shows `.` (empty).\n\n        *   **Aggression:** I need to close the score gap. I need to move towards the densest cluster of apples or the most accessible one.\n        *   Apples: (7, 7), (8, 5), (7, 3).\n        *   Moving **RIGHT** seems the best vector to target these.\n        *   However, let's check the immediate safety of **RIGHT**.\n        *   (5, 8) is empty.\n        *   If I move **RIGHT**, and the enemy moves... the enemy is at (1,6). He can't reach me.\n        *   If I move **DOWN** to (4, 7), I am safe.\n        *   If I move **LEFT** to (3, 8), I am safe.\n\n        *   **Decision:** I will move **RIGHT**. Why? Because I want to get to the right side apples.\n        *   Actually, looking at the board state again:\n            `7 . A . . . . . A . .`\n            `6 T 1 . . . . . . . A`\n            `5 T . . . . . A . A .`\n            *   The apples at (7, 7) and (8, 5) and (7, 3) are prime targets.\n            *   (5, 8) is a clear path.\n            *   (4, 7) is also a clear path.\n            *   (3, 8) is a clear path.\n\n        *   Let's look at the apple at (4, 2) and (4, 1).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (4, 7), I am on the vertical strip x=4.\n        *   (4, 6) is empty.\n        *   (4, 5) is empty.\n        *   (4, 4) is empty.\n        *   (4, 3) is empty.\n        *   (4, 2) has an apple.\n        *   (4, 1) has an apple.\n\n        *   So, going DOWN puts me on a line with apples at (4, 2) and (4, 1).\n        *   Going RIGHT puts me on a line towards (7, 7), (8, 5).\n\n        *   The enemy is at x=1. If I go DOWN, I stay at x=4. If I go RIGHT, I go to x=5.\n        *   The enemy is growing faster. I need food NOW.\n        *   The apple at (4, 2) is distance 5 moves down.\n        *   The apple at (7, 7) is distance 3 moves right and 1 down.\n\n        *   Let's go **RIGHT**. It feels more central and less \"wall-hugging\" than going DOWN towards the bottom wall, or LEFT towards the enemy wall.\n        *   Wait, if I go DOWN, I might run into the bottom wall (y=0). That's dangerous.\n        *   If I go RIGHT, I have the whole right side of the board open.\n        *   If I go LEFT, I get closer to the enemy (x=1). Risky.\n\n        *   **Final Choice:** RIGHT to (5, 8). It keeps options open.\n        *   Check safety of RIGHT one last time.\n        *   (5, 8) is empty.\n        *   My body is at (4, 9).\n        *   Enemy is at (1, 6).\n        *   No one can crash into me at (5, 8) this turn.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm moving **RIGHT** to (5, 8).

I'm still small. I need to close the gap fast.\n*   **The Board:** I'm at (5, 8). I need to find food immediately to start competing.\n    *   **Apple at (7, 7):** My primary target. It's close and aggressive.\n    *   **Apple at (8, 5):** Secondary target, closer to the right wall.\n    *   **Enemy:** He's at x=1. He's slow to turn around. I need to keep distance while I bulk up.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (From (5, 8)):**\n1.  **UP:** To (5, 9). **SAFE.** (Board shows '.' at 5,9).\n2.  **DOWN:** To (5, 7). **SAFE.** (Board shows '.' at 5,7).\n3.  **LEFT:** To (4, 8). **CRASH.** That's my previous head position, now my body. **DEAD.** (Backwards move).\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (6, 8). **SAFE.** (Board shows '.' at 6,8).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am in a wide open space on the right side.\n*   **LEFT** is death. Never move backwards into your own body.\n*   **UP** to (5, 9) is safe, but it hugs the top wall. It limits my future movements to the left and down (can't go up further). It's safe for now, but might corner me later.\n*   **DOWN** to (5, 7) is safe. It keeps me at y=7, moving toward the apple at (7, 7) via (6, 7).\n*   **RIGHT** to (6, 8) is safe. It moves me toward the apple at (7, 7) via (7, 8) or (6, 7).\n\n**TARGET LOCK: (7, 7)**\nI need that apple. It's the closest one that isn't near the bottom wall (which is a dead end if I chase (4, 1)/(4, 2)).\n*   If I go **DOWN** to (5, 7), I am 2 steps away from (7, 7) (via (6,7)).\n*   If I go **RIGHT** to (6, 8), I am 2 steps away from (7, 7) (via (7,8) or (6,7)).\n*   If I go **UP** to (5, 9), I am 3 steps away.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need to start the flank on the apple at (7, 7). Moving **DOWN** to (5, 7) is the most direct path that also opens up the center of the board (y=6) for the next turn. Going RIGHT is good, but DOWN keeps me slightly closer to the center lanes while still pushing toward the target.\n\nI'm moving **DOWN** to (5, 7). From there, I can sweep right to (6, 7) and secure the apple at (7, 7) next turn. Let's feast!\n\nDOWN",

To get there, he needs to go DOWN.\n    *   If he goes **DOWN** to (1, 7) or (0, 7), he is moving away from me.\n    *   However, if he tries to flank right, he might come to (2, 8) or (2, 7). But he has a massive body blocking his right side. He is trapped in the left column.\n*   **The Board:** I am at (5, 7). The **Apple at (7, 7)** is my target. It is 2 cells away (Right to 6,7 then 7,7).\n*   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy head is at (1, 8). My head is at (5, 7). The Manhattan distance is |5-1| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   In a simultaneous move, if I move **RIGHT** (to 6,7) and he moves **RIGHT** (to 2,8), distance remains large.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** (to 5,6), he moves **DOWN** (to 1,7), distance remains large.\n    *   **UNLESS** he predicts my exact path and tries to cut me off.

The enemy is stuck on the left side (x=0 and x=1). He cannot reach me this turn or next turn unless I make a suicidal move.\n*   **LEFT** to (4, 7) is safe but moves me away from the apple at (7, 7).\n*   **DOWN** to (5, 6) is safe, but I lose ground on the apple.\n*   **RIGHT** to (6, 7) is the optimal play. It puts me one step away from the apple at (7, 7).\n*   **Check for collision:** Enemy is at (1, 8). He cannot reach (6, 7) in one turn. Even if he moves Right (2,8) and Down (2,7) next turn, he is far. My path is clear.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI am making a beeline for that apple. I need to grow to start closing the 5-point gap.

If he moves **RIGHT** to (3, 8) or **DOWN** to (2, 7), he is nowhere near me. The Manhattan distance is huge (approx 6-7 cells). He cannot reach my destination (7, 7) this turn. He is too slow and too far.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (From (6, 7)):**\n1.  **UP:** To (6, 8). Is it safe? Let's check the board. (6, 8) is currently empty ('.'). **SAFE.** But does it help me? No. I lose the apple.\n2.  **DOWN:** To (6, 6). Board shows (6, 6) is empty ('.'). **SAFE.** But the apple is UP at (7, 7).\n3.  **LEFT:** To (5, 7). **CRASH.** That's my current body. **DEAD.** I cannot go backwards.\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (7, 7). Board shows (7, 7) is an Apple ('A'). **SAFE.** And I eat it!\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am setting a **TRAP**. By eating the apple at (7, 7), I grow. The enemy is currently at (2, 8). His only safe moves are likely Down or Right (since Left is blocked by his own body).\nIf he goes **RIGHT** to (3, 8), he is moving horizontally away from me.\nIf he goes **DOWN** to (2, 7), he is moving down, trying to reach the bottom apples.\nWhile he struggles in the corner, I will dominate the right side. I need to widen my reach so I can eventually box him in.\nThis move is **AGGRESSIVE CONTENT**. I get the apple, I grow, and I maintain distance from the enemy.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm snatching that apple right in front of me. I move **RIGHT** to (7, 7). I grow. I score. I keep the pressure ON!\n\nRIGHT",

We just ate that apple at (7, 7) last turn, so we're sitting pretty at length 3, but the scoreboard is looking nasty: 2 vs 6. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e vs \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e. We're in a 4-apple hole, but the game is far from over. We need to start closing the gap and asserting dominance on this board!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (7, 7). Body: [(6, 7), (5, 7)] (since I moved right to eat). Wait, actually looking at the board state provided:\n    ```\n     7 . T . . . T T 0 . .\n    ```\n    It seems the board representation might be slightly lagging or I'm looking at the pre-move state. But the move is done. I am at (7, 7). My previous body was [(6, 7), (5, 7)]. The tail is at (5, 7). So my body is [(6, 7), (5, 7)]. Correct.\n*   **Opponent:** Snake #1 is at (3, 8). His body stretches from (2, 8) down to (0, 5). He is a long wall on the left side. He has 6 apples. He is growing. I cannot let him run away with this.\n*   **Board:** There are apples scattered. I need to look at where I can go without dying. I am at (7, 7). Where can I move?\n    *   **UP (7, 8):** Empty on the board map ('.'). Safe?\n    *   **DOWN (7, 6):** The map shows (7, 6) is '.' (empty). Safe?\n    *   **LEFT (6, 7):** This is my current body segment. **CRASH.** Can't go left.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 7):** The map shows (8, 7) is '.' (empty). Safe?\n\n**MOVES & SAFETY CHECK:**\n1.  **UP (7, 8):** Board shows '.'. No apple immediately visible here. Safe from walls/obstacles. Distance to enemy head (3, 8) is |7-3| + |8-8| = 4. Enemy is at (3, 8), length ~7. He can't reach (7, 8) in one turn (max speed 1). He is safe to move.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 6):** Board shows '.'. Safe. Distance to enemy is |7-3| + |6-8| = 4+2=6. Very safe.\n3.  **RIGHT (8, 7):** Board shows '.'. Safe. Distance to enemy is |8-3| + |7-8| = 5+1=6. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nI need to eat apples to catch up. I have 2, he has 6.\nLooking at the Apple list: (9, 3), (7, 0), (4, 1), (3, 0), (6, 5), (4, 2), (2, 0), (9, 6), (8, 5), (8, 2), (7, 1), (7, 3), (6, 4), (4, 0), (4, 6).\n\nI am at (7, 7).\n*   If I go **UP to (7, 8)**: I'm high up. Apple at (9, 6) is close-ish. Apple at (8, 5) is close. But I'm moving into the top row essentially.\n*   If I go **DOWN to (7, 6)**: This puts me closer to (6, 5) and (7, 7) is behind me (which is empty now). This seems like a pivot point to head towards the cluster of apples on the left-center or bottom.\n*   If I go **RIGHT to (8, 7)**: This moves me towards the right wall. Apple at (9, 6) is close. Apple at (8, 5) is close. But it's a dead end if I go too far right.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nWhere is the enemy? (3, 8).\nIf I go **UP**, I go towards the top right.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I go towards the center.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I commit to the right side.\n\nWait, looking at the board state again:\n```\n 7 . T . . . T T 0 . .  -> Wait, the board shows (7,7) is '0'? No, (7,7) is my head.\n```\nLet's re-read the board visual carefully.\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . T T 1 . . . . . .\n 7 . T . . . T T 0 . .\n```\nWait, the text says `Board State`:\n```\n 7 . T . . . T T 0 . .\n```\nThis implies:\n(0,7): .\n(1,7): T\n(2,7): .\n(3,7): .\n(4,7): .\n(5,7): T\n(6,7): T\n(7,7): 0\n(8,7): .\n(9,7): .\n\nBut the Apple list and the \"Last Move\" said I moved RIGHT to (7,7).\nThe previous turn I was at (6,7).\nMy body was [(6,7), (5,7)].\nSo I moved to (7,7). My body becomes [(6,7), (5,7)] (wait, actually the tail moves, so it becomes [(6,7), (5,7)]? No, if I eat an apple, I don't lose the tail. I grow.\nSo new body: [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7)]? No, that's not how it works.\nIf I am at (6,7), body [(5,7)].\nI move RIGHT to (7,7). I eat an apple.\nNew Head: (7,7).\nNew Body: The old head (6,7) becomes the first body segment. The old body (5,7) becomes the second.\nSo: Head (7,7), Body [(6,7), (5,7)].\nWait, the board says:\n```\n 7 . T . . . T T 0 . .\n```\n(5,7) is T.\n(6,7) is T.\n(7,7) is 0.\nThis matches my expected position EXACTLY.\nHowever, the apple list says apples are at specific places. (7,7) was an apple, so I ate it. It's gone.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(9, 3), (7, 0), (4, 1), (3, 0), (6, 5), (4, 2), (2, 0), (9, 6), (8, 5), (8, 2), (7, 1), (7, 3), (6, 4), (4, 0), (4, 6)\n\nI am at (7,7).\nNearest apples?\n(9, 6) - distance 1+1=2 (Diagonal).\n(8, 5) - distance 1+2=3.\n(7, 3) - distance 0+4=4.\n(6, 4) - distance 1+3=4.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nI need to move to a square that is safe and puts me in a good position for the next turn.\nMy moves:\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** Safe. Keeps me high. Opens up path to (9,6) and (8,5).\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 6):** Safe. This is a critical square. It allows me to pivot left towards (6,5) or right towards (8,5).\n3.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Safe. Moves towards the right wall. Might limit my options later.\n\n**Threat Analysis:**\nThe enemy is at (3, 8). He has length 7.\nHe can move to (4, 8), (3, 9), (2, 8) (illegal, body), (3, 7).\nIf he moves (3, 7), that's dangerous distance-wise? No, he's far.\nMy main goal is to catch up in apples.\n(9, 6) is a prime target. It's at the top right.\n(8, 5) is also a good target.\nIf I go **UP (7, 8)**, I am getting closer to both.\nIf I go **RIGHT (8, 7)**, I am getting closer to (9,6) but slightly further from (8,5) vertically? No, (8,7) to (8,5) is 2 down.\nIf I go **DOWN (7, 6)**, I am moving away from the (9,6) apple.\n\nThe enemy is on the left. I want to claim the right side.\nThe apple at (9, 6) is the best prize on the board right now. It's isolated and valuable.\nTo get there safely, I should not box myself in.\n(7, 8) is a great move. It moves me toward the top-right corner where the apples are.\nIs (7, 8) safe?\nEnemy is at (3, 8).\nIf he moves RIGHT to (4, 8) or (5, 8)... he can't reach (7, 8) in one turn.\nMy body is at (6, 7) and (5, 7).\n(7, 8) is empty.\nIt is safe.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (7, 8).\nNext turn, aim for (8, 7) or (9, 6) depending on apple spawns and enemy movement.\nWait, if I go UP to (7, 8), my options next turn are:\n- (7, 9) (Top edge)\n- (8, 8)\n- (6, 8)\n- (7, 7) (My previous spot, but is it occupied by my body? No, my body moves. (7, 7) will be empty).\nSo I have good options.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 7):\n- (9, 7) (Edge)\n- (8, 8)\n- (8, 6)\n- (7, 7)\nAlso good options, but (8, 7) is closer to the wall.\n(7, 8) feels more central to the top-right area.\n\nWait, look at the board.\n```\n 8 . T T 1 . . . . . .\n 7 . T . . . T T 0 . .\n```\nEnemy is at (3, 8).\nIf I go UP to (7, 8):\n(7, 8) is currently '.'.\nMy body is (6, 7), (5, 7).\nIf the enemy moves aggressively (e.g., RIGHT to 4,8 or 5,8), he's still far.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN (3,7), he's safe.\nI am not in immediate danger of a head-on collision unless he moves a massive distance, which he can't.\n\n**Why not DOWN?**\nGoing DOWN to (7, 6) puts me in the mix with apples (6,5) and (8,5).\nBut (7, 6) is below my current position.\nGoing UP establishes dominance on the high ground.\nActually, looking at the apples:\n(9, 6) is Top Right.\n(8, 5) is Top Right.\n(7, 3) is Middle Right.\n(6, 4) is Middle.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 6), I am at (7,6). Next I can go to (8,6) -> (9,6). Or (7,5) -> (8,5).\nIf I go UP to (7, 8), I am at (7,8). Next I can go to (8,8) -> (9,8) (No apple), or (7,7) -> (7,6)...\nWait, if I go UP to (7,8), I might be walking away from the nearest apples (which are at Y=5 and Y=6).\n(9,6) is the nearest distinct apple.\nFrom (7,7) to (9,6) is distance 3.\nFrom (7,8) to (9,6) is distance 3.\nFrom (7,6) to (9,6) is distance 2.\n\nSo mathematically, **DOWN (7,6)** gets me closer to (9,6) and (8,5) faster.\n(7,6) is also a pivot to go LEFT towards (6,5).\nLet's look at the board at (7,6).\nThe board shows:\n```\n 6 T T . . A . . . . A\n```\nWait, (7,6) is listed as '.' in the visual?\nVisual:\n```\n 6 T T . . A . . . . A\n```\nCoordinates:\n(0,6) T\n(1,6) T\n...\n(4,6) A (Wait, the apple list says (4,6) is an apple. Yes.)\n(5,6) .\n(6,6) .\n(7,6) .\n(8,6) .\n(9,6) A\n\nSo (7,6) is empty. Safe.\nIf I go DOWN to (7,6):\nMy next moves can be:\n- RIGHT to (8,6) -> towards (9,6)\n- LEFT to (6,6) -> towards (6,5) (Apple)\n- UP to (7,7) (My previous spot)\n- DOWN to (7,5)\n\n(7,5) is also an empty spot.\n```\n 5 T . . . . . A . A .\n```\n(7,5) is '.'.\nThis seems like a very flexible move.\n\n**COMPARISON: UP vs DOWN**\n**UP (7,8):** Moves me towards the edge. Less flexibility. Further from (8,5) and (6,5).\n**DOWN (7,6):** Moves me towards the center of the right side. Closer to multiple apples. More flexibility.\n\nThe enemy is at (3, 8). He is high.\nIf I go DOWN, I put distance between us vertically.\nIf I go UP, I stay on his level (Y=8 vs Y=8).\nStaying on his level is risky if he moves right aggressively.\nBut he has a long body. He can't turn quickly.\nIf I go DOWN, I am safer from his immediate horizontal lunge.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will move **DOWN to (7, 6)**.\nWhy?\n1.  **Safety:** It creates vertical distance from the enemy (who is at Y=8).\n2.  **Apple Proximity:** It is closer to the cluster of apples on the right side (8,5), (9,6), (7,3).\n3.  **Flexibility:** (7,6) allows movement left, right, or down. It's a central node on the right half.\n\n**Safety Check for (7,6):**\n- Out of bounds? No.\n- Own body? My body is at (6,7) and (5,7). (7,6) is not my body.\n- Enemy body? Enemy is at x=0-3. (7,6) is far away.\n- Enemy head collision? Enemy is at (3,8). He can't reach (7,6).\n- Two heads same cell? No.\n\nIt is safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nConsume apples on the right side (8,5), (9,6) to close the score gap. Force the enemy to stay in the left corner. Use my length to block him off eventually. Don't let him expand.\n\nMove: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

We're sitting at (7, 6) after that last move, and I'm looking at the board like a predator hunting its prey.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (7, 6). Body: [(7, 7), (6, 7)]. Length 3.\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #1 is still chilling on the left side at (3, 8). He's long, but he's stuck in that corner.\n*   **The Plan:** I need to secure food and dominate the right side of the board. I see apples at (9, 6), (8, 5), and (7, 3) that are ripe for the taking.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\nI'm at (7, 6). Let's see where I can go:\n1.  **UP to (7, 7):** This is my previous spot, but it's currently occupied by my own body segment! I can't move backwards into myself. **DEAD.**\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** The board shows this is empty ('.'). Safe move. This keeps me in the central column.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** The board shows this is empty ('.'). Safe move. This moves me toward the center.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 6):** The board shows this is empty ('.'). Safe move. This moves me toward the right wall and the apple at (9, 6).\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\nMy goal is to sweep the right side for apples while keeping distance from the enemy on the left.\n*   **UP** is a death sentence (hit my own body).\n*   **DOWN** to (7, 5) is safe, but it keeps me relatively central.\n*   **LEFT** to (6, 6) moves me toward the center, but the enemy is on the left. I want to claim the right side!\n*   **RIGHT** to (8, 6) is the move. It positions me perfectly to grab the apple at (9, 6) next turn. It claims territory on the right edge, away from the enemy. It gives me options to go up or down after grabbing the apple.\n\nI'm choosing **RIGHT**. I'm coming for that apple and I'm taking over the right flank. Let's go!\n\nRIGHT",

He's slow and trapped in that corner.\n*   **The Plan:** We are at (8, 6). We just moved RIGHT to get here. Now we need to secure more territory and apples. Looking at the board, we have apples nearby: (9, 6) is right next to us, (8, 5) is below, and (7, 3) is a bit further down.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\nLet's check our options from (8, 6):\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):** The board shows this is empty ('.'). Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** The board shows this is empty ('.'). Safe. Plus, there's an apple at (8, 5)! We can eat next turn if we move there now.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** This is our own body! We just moved from (7, 6) to (8, 6). Moving back would hit ourselves. **DEAD.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** The board shows this is empty ('.'). Safe. There's an apple at (9, 6) waiting for us.\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\nWe need to eat to grow and catch up. We have two immediate apple targets: (9, 6) to the RIGHT and (8, 5) below.\n*   **LEFT** is death.\n*   **UP** to (8, 7) is safe, but it doesn't get us closer to an apple immediately.\n*   **DOWN** to (8, 5) puts us right on an apple. That's a guaranteed point next turn. It also keeps us in the column with the apple at (7, 3) below it.\n*   **RIGHT** to (9, 6) puts us on the wall, but right next to an apple. That's also a guaranteed point next turn.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (9, 6), we hug the wall and can potentially sweep the top right. But if we go DOWN to (8, 5), we open up the center of the right side and can pivot to (7, 3) or (6, 4) after eating. Going DOWN gives us more flexibility and keeps us away from the wall. We want to dominate the board, not just the edge.\n\nI'm choosing **DOWN** to (8, 5). We secure the apple at (8, 5) next turn, grow, and keep our options open to chase the apple at (7, 3) or sweep rightwards. We are closing the gap!\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7)].\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #1 is still on the left side. His tail is at (1, 7), and he's stretching out. He's not an immediate threat to us on the right side yet.\n*   **Board State:** We just ate at (8, 5). We are in the column with the apple at (7, 3) and (4, 0). There are apples scattered around the center and bottom right.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\nFrom (8, 5), where can we go?\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):** This is our own body (the segment we just vacated last turn). If we go back there, we die. **NO GO.**\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 4):** The board shows this is empty ('.'). Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):** The board shows this is empty ('.'). Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):** The board shows this is empty ('.'). Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\nWe are on the right side of the board. We need to control territory and keep our options open.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 5):** This hugs the wall. While safe, it traps us against the edge. We want to dominate the board, not just the border. Moving right limits our future movements significantly.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 4):** This keeps us in the same column. There is an apple at (4, 0) way down there. But looking at the board, (8, 4) is empty, and (8, 3) is empty. However, (7, 3) is an apple. If we go DOWN, we might be moving away from the closer apple at (7, 3).\n*   **LEFT to (7, 5):** This moves us into the center of the right side. It connects us to the apple at (7, 3) (just two steps down) and keeps us mobile. From (7, 5), we can go DOWN to (7, 4) -> (7, 3) to eat. We can also go LEFT to (6, 5) which is an apple! Or UP to (7, 6) (our body, danger). Or RIGHT back to (8, 5).\n\nWait, checking the board again.\n(7, 5) is empty.\n(6, 5) has an apple.\n(7, 4) is empty.\n(7, 3) has an apple.\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (7, 5)**, we position ourselves perfectly to eat the apple at (6, 5) next turn (if it's safe) OR sweep down to (7, 3). It opens up the center of the board. It avoids the wall. It avoids the immediate danger of our own body (which is UP).\nThis move gives us the most flexibility. We are currently in the \"Danger Zone\" of the right edge. Moving Left brings us back to the center of the action where the apples are. We need to secure that apple at (6, 5) or (7, 3).\n\nLet's look at the apples again:\n(9, 6) - Wall.\n(8, 5) - Ate it.\n(7, 3) - Good target.\n(6, 5) - Good target.\n(4, 6) - Further left.\n\nBy going **LEFT**, we threaten both the apple at (6, 5) and the apple at (7, 3). We are maintaining a central position in our zone. The enemy is far away on the left. We have time to sweep the right side. Let's close the gap on the score.\n\n**PLAN:**\n1.  Move LEFT to (7, 5).\n2.  Next turn, evaluate (6, 5) (Apple) vs (7, 4) (path to 7,3).\n3.  Force a head-on collision later if we get the score lead.\n\nWe are aggressive. We take the center. We don't get pinned on the wall. Let's go!\n\nLEFT\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

It has an apple! But... I need to check where Snake #1 is going. He is currently at (5, 6).\n    *   If I go **LEFT to (6, 5)**, I eat the apple and grow.\n    *   Enemy is at (5, 6). If he goes **RIGHT**, he goes to (6, 6). That's safe next to me.\n    *   If he goes **DOWN**, he goes to (5, 5). Safe.\n    *   If he goes **LEFT**, he stays left.\n    *   **CRITICAL CHECK:** Could he go **RIGHT** to (6, 6) AND I go **LEFT** to (6, 5)? No collision. He is at y=6, I am at y=5. Different rows.\n    *   **CRITICAL CHECK:** Could he go **DOWN** to (5, 5) AND I go **LEFT** to (6, 5)? No collision. Different columns.\n    *   **WAIT!** What if he goes **RIGHT** to (6, 6) and I go **LEFT** to (6, 5)? No collision.\n    *   **BUT!** What if he goes **UP-RIGHT?** He can't move diagonal. Only cardinal.\n    *   **ACTUALLY:** He is at (5, 6). If he goes **RIGHT**, he hits (6, 6). I am going to (6, 5). No collision.\n    *   **HOWEVER:** I am at (7, 5). My tail is at (7, 6). If I go **LEFT**, my new head is (6, 5). My body becomes [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\n    *   **DANGER CHECK:** If Snake #1 goes **RIGHT**, he goes to (6, 6). That's adjacent to me at (6, 5).

No.\n        *   From (5, 6): Up (5, 7). No.\n        *   From (5, 6): Down (5, 5). No.\n        *   From (5, 6): Left (4, 6). No.\n        *   **He CANNOT land on (6, 5) this turn.**\n    *   **BODY CHECK:** Is (6, 5) currently occupied?\n        *   My body: (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6).

AND it positions me closer to the enemy's tail/zone.\n\n4.  **DOWN (7, 4):**\n    *   Empty. Safe.\n    *   Moves me away from the apple at (6, 5).\n    *   Moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3).\n    *   But I'm missing out on a guaranteed eat *if* it's safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nChat, we are aggressive. We need to close the score gap. (6, 5) is right there. It is safe. Snake #1 cannot hit it. I cannot hit myself. The board is clear.\nIf I go LEFT, I eat. I grow. I get to 4 apples. He is at 6. The gap is closing.\nIf I go DOWN, I play it safe but I lose momentum. The apple at (6, 5) might despawn or get eaten later.\n\nLet's look at the board state visualization:\n```text\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . T T T T T . A . .\n 7 . . . . . T . . . .\n 6 . . . . A 1 . T T A\n 5 . . . . . . A 0 T .  <-- I am at 7,5. Apple is at 6,5.\n 4 . . . . . . A . . .\n```\nWait, looking at the text board:\n`5 . . . . . . A 0 T .`\nThis implies (6,5) is the apple `A`.\nI am at (7,5). The `0` is at (7,5).\nSo (6,5) is indeed `A`.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGrab the apple. Force the issue. We need to get to 30. We are behind.\nNext turn, from (6, 5) (assuming I eat), I will have body segments at [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\nFrom (6, 5), I can go DOWN to (6, 4) (Empty), LEFT to (5, 5) (Empty), or UP to (6, 6) (Empty).\nRight is back to (7, 5) (Body).\nI will have options.\n\nLet's check the apple list: `(6, 5)` is listed in `APPLE DROPS`. It's valid.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (6,5) to close the score gap to 4-6. Move towards the center/right cluster of apples. Watch Snake #1's movement; he's long and slow, we can outmaneuver him in the open space. Once we lead in score, we look for the box-in.\n\n**MOVE:**\nI am moving **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

We need to close this gap and fast.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the board state from (6, 5):\n- **UP (6, 6):** Empty. \u2705\n- **DOWN (6, 4):** Empty. \u2705\n- **LEFT (5, 5):** Empty. \u2705\n- **RIGHT (7, 5):** My own body. \u274c\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 6). He\u2019s got a long body, but he\u2019s not close enough to threaten these squares *unless* he moves aggressively.\n- If I go **UP (6, 6)**, I\u2019m getting closer to that apple at (6, 7) and opening up the right side. But is it safe? Snake #1 is at (4, 6). If he goes RIGHT (5, 6) and then NEXT turn goes RIGHT again (6, 6), he could corner me. I\u2019d rather keep my distance from his head.\n- If I go **DOWN (6, 4)**, there\u2019s an apple at (6, 4)! Wait, looking at the board: `(6, 4)` is `A`. YES! There is an apple directly below me. But wait, looking closer at the grid:\n  ```\n  5 . . . . . . A 0 T .\n  4 . . . . . . A . . .\n  ```\n  At (6, 4) there is an apple `A`. If I go down, I eat. But wait, looking at the apple list: `(6, 4)` is indeed listed.\n  However, look at the board again. Row 5: `. . . . . . A 0 T .` My head is at (6, 5). The apple is at (6, 5)? No, the apple is at (6, 5) was my *previous* turn. I just ate it (Turn 16).\n  \n  Let's re-read the board state carefully.\n  `5 . . . . . . A 0 T .`\n  This is Turn 17 *before* I move.\n  The `A` is at (6, 5)? No, wait.\n  Coordinates: (0,0) is bottom left.\n  Row 5: Columns 0-9.\n  The string is: `. . . . . . A 0 T .`\n  - Col 0: `.`\n  - Col 1: `.`\n  - Col 2: `.`\n  - Col 3: `.`\n  - Col 4: `.`\n  - Col 5: `.`\n  - Col 6: `A` -> (6, 5) is an Apple!\n  - Col 7: `0` -> My head is at (7, 5)? No, the text says \"Head: (6, 5)\" in the description.\n  \n  **CRITICAL DISCREPANCY:**\n  Description says: `Head: (6, 5)`\n  Board visualization says: `5 . . . . . . A 0 T .`\n  This visual places the `0` (Me) at column 7, and an `A` at column 6.\n  If I am at (6, 5) as per the text, and the board shows `A` at (6, 5) visually, that's an apple.\n  If I am at (7, 5) as per the visual, and the board shows `0` at (7, 5), that's me.\n  \n  Let's trust the text description for coordinates: **Head at (6, 5)**.\n  If the board shows `A` at column 6 on row 5, that means there is an apple at **(6, 5)**.\n  **BUT I AM ALREADY STANDING ON (6, 5).**\n  \n  Wait, looking at the *previous* turn rationale: \"LEFT to (6, 5)\".\n  The *previous* move was LEFT. That moved me from (7, 5) to (6, 5).\n  If I moved LEFT to (6, 5), and that square had an apple, I grew.\n  The description says `Head: (6, 5)`.\n  The Board State shows Row 5: `. . . . . . A 0 T .`\n  This implies the apple is at (6, 5) and I am at (7, 5). OR the visual is shifted.\n  \n  Let's look at the visual grid again:\n  `5 . . . . . . A 0 T .`\n  If this is accurate to coordinates:\n  - (0,5) is `.`\n  - (6,5) is `A`\n  - (7,5) is `0` (My Head)\n  - (8,5) is `T` (My Body)\n  \n  **CONCLUSION:** The text description \"Head: (6, 5)\" might be slightly lagging or the visual representation is shifted by 1.\n  However, the `APPLE DROPS` list contains `(6, 5)`.\n  If I am at (6, 5) and (6, 5) is an apple, I am currently eating it (or just ate it).\n  \n  Let's look at the Apple List again:\n  `(9, 3), (7, 0), (4, 1), (3, 0), (4, 2), (2, 0), (9, 6), (8, 2), (7, 1), (7, 3), (6, 4), (4, 0), (7, 8), (6, 7), (2, 5)`\n  \n  **Wait, is (6, 5) in the list?**\n  No. The list contains `(6, 4)` and `(6, 7)`.\n  So **(6, 5) IS NOT AN APPLE.**\n  \n  Let's re-read the visual board:\n  `5 . . . . . . A 0 T .`\n  If `0` is at (7, 5) and `A` is at (6, 5), and I am NOT on an apple...\n  Then my head is at (7, 5).\n  The text description says \"Head: (6, 5)\".\n  \n  There is a conflict.\n  1. Text says Head (6, 5). Board shows `0` at col 7 (7, 5).\n  2. Board shows `A` at col 6 (6, 5).\n  3. Apple list does NOT contain (6, 5).\n  \n  **If the visual board is correct:**\n  My Head is at (7, 5).\n  There is an Apple at (6, 5).\n  I am standing at (7, 5).\n  My moves from (7, 5) are:\n  - UP (7, 6): Body (T). **DEAD**.\n  - DOWN (7, 4): Empty. **SAFE**.\n  - LEFT (6, 5): Apple. **SAFE**.\n  - RIGHT (8, 5): Body (T). **DEAD**.\n  \n  **If the text description is correct (Head 6, 5):**\n  I am standing at (6, 5).\n  There is NO apple at (6, 5) (per list).\n  My moves from (6, 5) are:\n  - UP (6, 6): Empty.\n  - DOWN (6, 4): Empty (Wait, (6, 4) is in apple list!).\n  - LEFT (5, 5): Empty.\n  - RIGHT (7, 5): Body.\n  \n  **Let's trust the text description \"Head: (6, 5)\" as the ground truth for my location**, because the previous move rationale explicitly stated moving LEFT to (6, 5).\n  If I am at (6, 5):\n  - UP (6, 6): Empty.\n  - DOWN (6, 4): **APPLE!** (List contains (6, 4)).\n  - LEFT (5, 5): Empty.\n  - RIGHT (7, 5): Body.\n  \n  **Strategy Check:**\n  Enemy is at (4, 6).\n  If I go DOWN to (6, 4) (Apple):\n    - I eat an apple (Score 5).\n    - Enemy moves. He is at (4, 6). He can't reach me.\n  If I go UP to (6, 6):\n    - No apple (Apple is at (6, 7)).\n    - I move closer to enemy (Distance 2).\n  If I go LEFT to (5, 5):\n    - No apple.\n    - I move towards the center/left.\n  \n  **The Apple at (6, 4) is the play.** It is safe, it scores, and it moves me slightly away from the enemy's immediate cluster (he is at y=6, I go to y=4).\n  \n  **Long Term:**\n  We need points. We are 4 vs 7. We need to aggressively hunt apples. (6, 4) is right there. It's a free grow.\n  After eating at (6, 4), my body will be [(6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5)].\n  From (6, 4), I will have access to (6, 3), (5, 4), (7, 4).\n  \n  **Decision:**\n  GO DOWN. Eat the apple. Close the gap. 4 -> 5 apples.\n  Avoid the wall at (9,9) and the enemy at (4,6). Stay low and aggressive.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

He's creeping up in the top-left quadrant, but I'm positioned to make a move.\n\nLet's break down the board state from my head at **(6, 4)**:\n- **UP (6, 5):** My body (tail).\n- **DOWN (6, 3):** Empty space.\n- **LEFT (5, 4):** Empty space.\n- **RIGHT (7, 4):** Empty space.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\nGoing UP is a death sentence (into myself).

It's safe, but it keeps me at a low y-level (4) and doesn't immediately open up an apple.\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** Moves me right. Looking at the board, (7, 3) is an apple, but it's one step away.

We are trailing, so we need to play AGGRESSIVE but SMART.\n\n**MY CURRENT STATE:**\nHead: (6, 3)\nBody: (6, 4) -> (6, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 6)\nApples: 5\n\n**ANALYZING MY MOVES FROM (6, 3):**\n1.  **UP to (6, 4):** My body is right there. That is immediate death. \u274c\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Empty on the board. But look at the apple list! There is an apple at **(7, 3)**. If I go here, I eat, I grow, I get a point. Safe move.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 3):** Empty on the board. No apple here. It's safe, but it doesn't score.\n4.  **DOWN to (6, 2):** Empty on the board. No apple here.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 4). He's in a cluster. He has apples nearby, specifically **(4, 2)** or **(4, 1)** or **(7, 3)**. If he goes for **(7, 3)**, we collide!\n*   If I go **RIGHT** to (7, 3) and he goes **RIGHT** to (5, 4) -> (6, 4)? No, he's at (4, 4). He could go RIGHT to (5, 4).\n*   Let's check the board state carefully.\n    *   My head is (6, 3).\n    *   My body starts at (6, 4).\n    *   The board shows Row 3: `. . . . . . . A . A` -> (7, 3) is an apple.\n    *   The board shows Row 4: `. . . . . . 0 . . .` -> My head is (6, 4)?? Wait.\n    \n    **CRITICAL CHECK:**\n    The prompt says: \"Head: (6, 3)\".\n    The Board State shows Row 3 (Y=3): `. . . . . . . A . A`\n    Columns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    (6, 3) is the 7th character (index 6). That is `.` (empty).\n    (7, 3) is the 8th character (index 7). That is `A`.\n    \n    **So (7, 3) is definitely an apple.**\n    \n    **RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n    If I go **RIGHT** to (7, 3):\n    *   I eat an apple. Score: 6. I grow.\n    *   The enemy is at (4, 4). His likely moves:\n        *   Down (4, 3) - empty?\n        *   Left (3, 4) - empty?\n        *   Right (5, 4) - empty?\n    *   He is NOT close enough to collide with me at (7, 3) in one turn. Distance from (4, 4) to (7, 3) is Chebyshev distance 3. He moves 1 step.\n    *   Therefore, **RIGHT is safe.**\n\n    **What about the \"Box In\" strategy?**\n    To box him in, I need to control space. But right now, I need points to catch up (5 vs 7). Taking the guaranteed apple at (7, 3) is the most aggressive way to close the gap.\n    \n    **Alternative: LEFT to (5, 3)?**\n    (5, 3) is empty. No apple. No points.\n    \n    **Alternative: DOWN to (6, 2)?**\n    (6, 2) is empty. No apple.\n    \n    **CONCLUSION:**\n    **RIGHT** is the only move that scores points and is safe.\n    I will move RIGHT, eat the apple at (7, 3), and grow to 6 apples.\n    This keeps me on the right side of the board, away from the enemy's immediate cluster on the left/center.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7, 3) to close the score to 6-7. From (7, 3), I have options to go DOWN to (7, 2) (which has an apple at (7, 1) nearby) or potentially sweep right to (8, 2) or (9, 3). I need to maintain pressure and force the enemy into the corners. If I get the lead, I can start cutting off his paths.\n\nLET'S GOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

No, my body is at (6,3). This `T` is likely my body part.)\n*   Index 7: `0` (**MY HEAD**)\n*   Index 8: `.`\n*   Index 9: `A` (Apple!)\n\n**Wait, the prompt says my Head is (7, 3).**\nThe board shows `0` at `(7, 3)`.\nThe board shows `A` at `(9, 3)`.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (7, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 4):**\n    *   Visual Check: Row 4 (y=4) shows `. . . . T . T . . .` at index 7 (x=7) it is `.`.\n    *   My body: (6,3), (6,4)...\n    *   Is (7, 4) blocked by my body? No.\n    *   Is it an apple? No.\n    *   **Safe? Yes.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 2):**\n    *   Visual Check: Row 2 (y=2) shows `. . . . A . . A . .` at index 7 (x=7) it is `.`.\n    *   **Safe? Yes.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 3):**\n    *   Visual Check: Row 3 (y=3) index 6 (x=6) is `T` (Body).\n    *   **Deadly? Yes.** (Backwards into self).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n    *   Visual Check: Row 3 (y=3) index 8 (x=8) is `.`.\n    *   **Safe? Yes.**\n\n**WHERE IS THE APPLE?**\nI am at (7, 3). The only apple on Row 3 is at **(9, 3)**.\nI cannot reach it this turn.\nHowever, moving **RIGHT** to (8, 3) brings me 1 step closer to the apple at (9, 3).\nIf I move **RIGHT**, I will be at (8, 3). Next turn, I can go **RIGHT** again to (9, 3) and eat.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (Snake #1 at (4, 3)):**\nRow 3, Index 4 is `1`.\n*   Enemy is at (4, 3).\n*   **Enemy Options:**\n    *   **LEFT (3, 3):** Empty (`.`).\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 3):** Empty (`.`).\n    *   **DOWN (4, 2):** Row 2, Index 4 is `A` (Apple). **Highly likely he goes DOWN to eat.**\n    *   **UP (4, 4):** Row 4, Index 4 is `T` (His own body). **Deadly for him.**\n\n**STRATEGY:**\n1.  **Catch Up:** I am 6 vs 7. I need an apple.\n2.  **Target:** The apple at (9, 3) is the closest apple I can reach in 2 turns (8,3 -> 9,3).\n3.  **Safety:**\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (8, 3) is safe.\n    *   If Enemy goes DOWN (eating apple at 4,2), he grows. If he goes RIGHT (5,3), he moves toward me but is far.\n    *   If I move UP or DOWN, I lose distance to the apple at (9,3).\n    *   **RIGHT** is the only move that scores points *eventually*.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove **RIGHT** to (8, 3). Prepare to eat the apple at (9, 3) on the next turn. This closes the score gap to 7-7. From there, I'll dominate the right side of the board.\n\nLET'S GOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

Body lines up vertically from (5, 3) up to (5, 7).\n*   **BOARD STATE:** The enemy is positioned directly below a cluster of apples. I am on the right edge.\n\n**MOVES FROM (9, 3):**\n1.  **UP (9, 4):** CHECKING THE BOARD... I see a `.` (Empty) at (9, 4). Looks clear!\n2.  **DOWN (9, 2):** Visual check shows `A` (Apple) at (9, 2)? No, wait, looking at the board grid... Row 2 (y=2) ends with an `A` at (9, 2)? **NO!** Looking closely at the grid provided:\n    Row 2 (y=2): `. . . . A 1 A . A .`\n    Indices: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n    So (9, 2) is `.` (Empty). Safe. But wait, let me check the apple list: (9, 6), (8, 2), (7, 1), (4, 0)...\n    Actually, looking at the grid text specifically:\n    `2 . . . . A 1 A . A .`\n    (9, 2) is the last character on that line, which is a `.`.\n    However, I need to be careful. The grid is a visual representation. Let me verify the cells.\n    (9, 4) is Empty.\n    (9, 2) is Empty.\n    (8, 3) is Empty (my body moved from there, but remember simultaneous movement! My tail moves *after* I move).\n    (10, 3) is Out of Bounds.\n    \n    **CRITICAL CHECK:**\n    My body is currently at: [(8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5)].\n    If I move UP to (9, 4): I am not hitting my body.\n    If I move DOWN to (9, 2): I am not hitting my body.\n    If I move LEFT to (8, 3): **WAIT!** (8, 3) is currently occupied by my *own* body segment (the one right behind my head).\n    **RULE CHECK:** Moving directly backwards into your own body is DEATH.\n    So **LEFT is DEADLY**.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS (Snake #1 at (5, 2)):**\n*   The enemy is hungry. He has apples at (4, 1) and (4, 2) nearby.\n*   His head is at (5, 2).\n*   If he goes DOWN, he hits (5, 1). Is that an apple? Row 1: `. . . . A . . A . .` -> (5, 1) is empty.\n*   If he goes LEFT, he hits (4, 2). Is that an apple? Row 2: `. . . . A 1 A . A .` -> (4, 2) is an Apple!\n*   If he goes UP, he hits (5, 3). That is currently his *own* body (the segment behind his head).\n    *   *Correction:* His body is [(5, 3), (4, 3)...]. So (5, 3) is occupied.\n    *   **WAIT.** Simultaneous movement. His tail moves *after* he moves. If he goes UP to (5, 3), is that cell occupied by his *current* body?\n    *   Yes, (5, 3) is the first segment of his body listed. Unless he grows, that segment moves to (5, 4).\n    *   If he goes UP to (5, 3), he is moving into the cell his body *just* vacated? No, simultaneous means we consider the board state *before* the move.\n    *   Before the move, (5, 3) is occupied by his body. So he cannot go UP.\n    *   So his options are LEFT (to apple), DOWN, or RIGHT (into his own body at (6, 2)? No, (6, 2) is empty).\n    *   Wait, his body is at (5, 3), (4, 3)... so (6, 2) is empty.\n    *   **PREDICTION:** He will likely go LEFT to (4, 2) to eat the apple and grow.\n\n**MY MOVE DECISION:**\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (9, 2).**\n    *   Is (9, 2) an apple? No.\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Does it open up opportunities? Yes, (9, 1) and (9, 3) (which will be empty as I leave).\n*   **Option 2: UP to (9, 4).**\n    *   Is (9, 4) an apple? No.\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Does it open up opportunities? Yes, leads towards (9, 6) apple and (9, 8) apple.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to secure apples to win. The closest apples are (9, 6) and (9, 8).\nMoving UP puts me closer to (9, 6).\nMoving DOWN puts me closer to (9, 1) (empty) or loops me around.\nThe enemy is on the left side. I am on the right. I should claim the right side vertical space.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing UP (9, 4) positions me to chase the apple at (9, 6) next turn. It keeps me away from the enemy who is on the left.\nGoing DOWN (9, 2) loops me into the bottom right corner, which is cramped (apples at 0,0 area).\nUP is the aggressive play to dominate the right column.\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove UP to (9, 4). From there, target (9, 6) next. Keep the enemy boxed in on the left.\n\n**FINAL CHECK:**\n(9, 4) is empty? Yes.\nNo self collision? Yes.\nNo enemy body collision? Enemy is at x=5, far away.\nSimultaneous collision? Enemy is at (5, 2). He is not moving to (9, 4).\nLooks clean.\n\nLet's go!\n\nUP",

He has apples at (4, 0) and (2, 0) nearby.\n*   His body is at: (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6).\n*   If he goes DOWN to (5, 0): Row 0 (y=0): `. . A A A . . A . .` (Indices 0-9). (5, 0) is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n*   If he goes LEFT to (4, 1): Is that an apple? Row 1: `. . . . A . . A . .`. (4, 1) is `A`. He will likely go LEFT to eat.\n*   If he goes UP to (5, 2): That is his own body (the segment behind him). He dies.\n*   If he goes RIGHT to (6, 1): Row 1: `(6, 1)` is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n*   **Prediction:** He sees an apple at (4, 1). He will almost certainly go LEFT to grow.\n\n**MY MOVE DECISION:**\n*   **Option 1: UP to (9, 5).**\n    *   Safe empty space.\n    *   Moves me towards the apple at (9, 6).\n    *   Opens up (9, 6) for next turn.\n    *   Keeps me isolated on the right edge.

I am on the right side (x=9).\nMy best path to growth is the vertical column on the right: (9, 5) -> (9, 6) [Apple] -> (9, 7) -> (9, 8) [Apple].\nBy staying on the right edge, I claim territory the enemy isn't contesting.\nIf I move LEFT, I enter the \"middle\" of the board where the enemy is, increasing the risk of a head-on collision or getting boxed in.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMoving UP secures my position on the right flank. It is the safest path to the immediate apple at (9, 6). It denies the enemy access to the right side by occupying the column.\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove UP to (9, 5). Next turn, move UP to (9, 6) to eat the apple. Then head to (9, 8).\n\n**FINAL CHECK:**\n(9, 5) is empty. No self collision. Enemy is at x=5. No cross-collision.\nLet's secure the bag.\n\nUP",

T T . . . A`. (9, 6) is an `A` (Apple)!\n    *   **Safety:** Is it empty? Yes. Is it my body? No (my body is at x=6,7,8,9 y=3,4,5). Is it enemy body? No (enemy is at x=4,5).\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE & REWARDING.** Eating an apple grows my score to 8, matching the enemy. It also extends my length, securing my position on the right edge.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 4):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (9, 4).\n    *   **Board Status:** Row 4 (y=4) is `. . . . T . T . . 0`.\n    *   **Safety:** (9, 4) contains my own body (the segment behind my head). Moving here is a collision. **DEADLY.**\n3.  **LEFT (8, 5):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (8, 5).\n    *   **Board Status:** Row 5 (y=5) is `. . A . T . T T . 0`. (8, 5) is a `T` (My own tail... wait, is it?).\n    *   **Wait, let's check the tail:** My tail is at (7, 5). (8, 5) is part of my body? No, looking at the grid, (8, 5) is marked as `T` in the visual map. But `T` usually means Tail or Snake segment. In the text description, my body is `[(9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)]`. (8, 5) is NOT in this list.\n    *   **Correction:** The text description says my body ends at (6, 5). The visual map shows `T` at (8, 5). There is a discrepancy. However, the visual map shows `(8, 5)` as `T`, which implies it's occupied. If it's my body, I die. If it's just a visual artifact, it's open. Given the map shows it as `T`, I should treat it as occupied by my body or an obstacle. **RISKY / POTENTIALLY DEADLY.**\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 5):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (10, 5).\n    *   **Safety:** Out of bounds (x=10 is off the 0-9 grid). **DEADLY.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n*   **UP (9, 6)** is the clear winner. It's the only safe move that guarantees survival and growth.\n*   By eating the apple at (9, 6), I match the opponent's score (8-8).\n*   I maintain my dominance on the right flank.\n*   The opponent is stuck on the left side. He can't reach me.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter eating at (9, 6), my head will be at (9, 6). My tail will move forward to (7, 5) -> (6, 5). (9, 5) will become part of my body.\nNext turn, I need to decide where to go. The apple at (9, 8) is visible. I should aim for that.\nPath: (9, 6) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 8).\n\n**FINAL CALL:**\nGo UP. Eat the apple. Tie the score. Secure the right side.\n\nUP",

I need to close this gap while ensuring survival.\n\n**Current Position Assessment:**\n- My head is at (9, 6)\n- My body stretches from (9, 5) down to (6, 5), forming a vertical line on the right edge\n- The opponent (Snake #1) is at (4, 0) with a long horizontal body spanning from (4, 0) to (5, 6)\n- There are several apples on the board, but I'm prioritizing position over apples\n\n**Move Analysis from (9, 6):**\n1. **UP to (9, 7):** \n   - Board shows (9, 7) is empty (`. . . . . . A . . .` on row 7)\n   - Safe move that maintains my right-edge dominance\n   - Sets up potential access to apple at (9, 8) next turn\n\n2. **DOWN to (9, 5):**\n   - This is my current body segment (just moved from here last turn)\n   - Immediate self-collision - DEADLY\n\n3. **LEFT to (8, 6):**\n   - Checking row 6: `. . . . T T . . . 0` - (8, 6) appears to be empty\n   - However, this moves me toward the center where the opponent is\n   - The opponent's body occupies columns 4-5 in rows 0-6\n   - Risk of getting boxed in or forced into collision\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 6):**\n   - Out of bounds (x=10) - IMMEDIATE DEATH\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nThe opponent is on the left side (x=4) with a long horizontal body. I'm on the right edge (x=9) with a vertical formation. Moving LEFT would bring me closer to their territory, which is dangerous given their length. Moving UP keeps me on my safe edge while opening up the path to (9, 8) apple next turn.\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk Assessment:**\nIf I go UP to (9, 7), the opponent might move in various directions. Their current head at (4, 0) could go UP to (4, 1), RIGHT to (5, 0), or LEFT to (3, 0). None of these would directly collide with me at (9, 7) this turn. The distance is too great for immediate danger.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nStay on the right edge, collect apples at (9, 8) and potentially (9, 9) if it becomes available. Force the opponent to come to me in my territory rather than venturing into theirs. With my score at 8 vs their 9, I need to start closing the gap aggressively but safely.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is the only safe move that maintains strategic advantage. It keeps me alive, preserves my right-edge position, and sets up for future apple collection while avoiding the opponent's dangerous territory.\n\nUP",

Opponent is on the left with a longer body, so we must force him into a corner while we collect apples at (9, 8) and (9, 9). Avoid the center at all costs\u2014his body blocks columns 4-5. If he moves up, he might expose his tail for a potential trap. We're 8 vs 10, so every apple counts. Keep the path open, stay alive, and wait for the moment to strike when he makes a mistake.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **Analyze current position:** My head at (9, 7). Body from (9, 6) down to (6, 4). Opponent head at (3, 0), body spanning columns 4-5 from y=0 to y=6.\n2. **Check each direction:**\n   - **UP to (9, 8):** Empty (board shows 'A' at (9, 8) but it's an apple, not a snake). Safe, and I'll eat the apple, growing to 9 apples. Also keeps me on the edge, opens up future moves to (9, 9) or (8, 8).\n   - **DOWN to (9, 6):** That's my own body (tail is at (6, 4), but (9, 6) is occupied by my body from the last move). Self-collision\u2014DEAD. Eliminate.\n   - **LEFT to (8, 7):** Check board: row 7 has '.' at column 8, so empty. However, moving left brings me closer to opponent's territory (columns 4-5). Opponent's body blocks a lot of space, and if he moves up, he could force me into a tight spot. Not optimal.\n   - **RIGHT to (10, 7):** Out of bounds (x=10 is outside 0-9). DEAD. Eliminate.\n3. **Remaining safe moves:** UP and LEFT are both safe from immediate death.\n4. **Choose the best among safe moves:**\n   - **UP** to (9, 8): Grows me to 9 apples, closing the score gap to 9 vs 10. Keeps me on the safe right edge, maintaining multiple options next turn (can go UP to (9, 9) for another apple, or LEFT to (8, 8) if needed). Also, (9, 8) is an apple, so I get content and growth.\n   - **LEFT** to (8, 7): No apple, just moves toward center. Increases risk of getting boxed in by opponent's long body. Doesn't improve score immediately.\n   - **Head-on collision risk:** Opponent's head at (3, 0) is far away; even if they move RIGHT or UP, they won't reach me this turn. No direct threat.\n5. **Strategic advantage:** UP not only grows me but also positions me to potentially dominate the top-right corner. With opponent's length, they might struggle in tight spaces, so staying away and collecting apples while they waste moves is key. We're aggressive, so taking the apple now is a must to keep up in score.\n\n**Chat, this is the play!** We're taking that apple, growing stronger, and staying safe on the edge. Opponent can't touch us here. Let's GOOO!\n\nUP",

Wait, after moving to (9,9), my body shifts\u2014tail will move).  \n  - Cons: No apple immediately, but sets up for future corner control.  \n- **LEFT to (8, 8):**  \n  - Pros: Moves toward the center, closer to apple at (8,2) or (7,8)? Actually, (8,8) is near the top. Might be safer in terms of space?  \n  - Cons: Moving away from the edge could trap me later if opponent expands upward.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan:**  \nStay on the edges! Opponent is in the bottom-left\u2014let them choke there. By staying on the right/top, I force them to traverse the board to catch me. If they chase, they might crash into walls or their own tail.

Opponent still at 11 apples, but we\u2019re closing the gap. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25  \n\n**Board check:**  \n- My body: Tail now at (9, 7)? Wait, last move was UP from (9, 7) to (9, 8). Body shifts: new tail is (9, 7)? Actually, body is HEAD-TO-TAIL: after eating apple, length increases. So body now: (9, 8) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6) ... all the way to (6, 4).  \n- Opponent: Head at (2, 0), body extends right/up from there. They\u2019re in the bottom-left corner.  \n\n**Safety Check (No Suicide!):**  \n1. **UP to (9, 9):**  \n   - Coordinates: x=9 (valid), y=9 (valid).  \n   - Apple? Yes! There's an apple at (9, 9) from earlier list? Not explicitly in current APPLE DROPS, but board shows empty (9,9) as '.'? Wait, board row 9: \"9 . A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 that\u2019s columns 0-9. At (9,9) it's '.' (empty). No apple there.  \n   - My body? (9,9) isn\u2019t in my body list (tail is (9,7) or lower). Safe.  \n   - Opponent body? Far away.  \n   - **Safe.**  \n2. **DOWN to (9, 7):**  \n   - My body now occupies (9,7) \u2014 it\u2019s the segment right below head.

No.  \n   - **Safe.**  \n4. **RIGHT to (10, 8):**  \n   - Out of bounds (x=10 invalid). **DEAD.**  \n\n**Safe moves: UP and LEFT.**  \n\n**Strategic Choice:**  \n- **UP to (9, 9):**  \n  - Pros: Moves to top-right corner, keeping me on the edge. Opens up next turn to potentially go LEFT to (8,9) or DOWN to (9,8) (but that\u2019s my old body? Wait, after moving to (9,9), my body shifts\u2014tail will move).  \n  - Cons: No apple immediately, but sets up for future corner control.  \n- **LEFT to (8, 8):**  \n  - Pros: Moves toward the center, closer to apple at (8,2) or (7,8)? Actually, (8,8) is near the top. Might be safer in terms of space?  \n  - Cons: Moving away from the edge could trap me later if opponent expands upward.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan:**  \nStay on the edges! Opponent is in the bottom-left\u2014let them choke there. By staying on the right/top, I force them to traverse the board to catch me. If they chase, they might crash into walls or their own tail. Keep options open: from (9,9), I can go LEFT to (8,9) next, then DOWN to (8,8), etc. Avoid center\u2014opponent\u2019s body blocks columns 4-5.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP to (9,9). It\u2019s safe, maintains edge position, and avoids giving opponent any chance to cut me off. Plus, I can always pivot left later.  \n\nChat, we\u2019re taking the high ground!

Their body blocks columns 2-5 in the lower rows. They're a wall, and I need to be the hammer. I moved UP to (9,9) last turn\u2014perfect! Now I'm in the top-right corner. From here, I can force them to chase me through dangerous territory. If they try to rush me, they'll hit their own tail or a wall. Let's keep the pressure on and try to force a mistake or a head-on collision if I can get the score lead. If they are at 11 and I'm at 9, I need 2 apples to tie, 3 to lead. The apple at (9,1) looks far, but maybe I can snake down the right edge.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- My Head: (9,9) (Top-Right corner!)\n- My Body: [(9,8), (8,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3)] - I'm a long line hugging the right wall and dipping down.\n- Opponent Head: (2,2). They are in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**Safety Check (No Suicide):**\n1.  **UP to (9,10):** Out of bounds (y=10). **DEAD.**\n2.  **DOWN to (9,8):**\n    -   Coordinates: Valid (9,8).\n    -   My body? Yes! (9,8) is currently my second segment (the one below head). That is a part of my body. Moving here is hitting myself. **DEAD.**\n    -   (Note: If I don't eat an apple this turn, my tail moves, but the head moving into the neck is always death).\n3.  **LEFT to (8,9):**\n    -   Coordinates: Valid (8,9).\n    -   My body? No. (Body is mostly at x=9 or x=8,y=8).\n    -   Opponent? No, they are far left.\n    -   Board state: Row 9 shows (8,9) is '.' (empty).\n    -   **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (10,9):** Out of bounds (x=10). **DEAD.**\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nOnly **LEFT** is a safe move.\n-   **Move LEFT to (8,9):**\n    -   **Pros:** Stays on the top edge. Keeps me safe from the opponent's immediate reach. Opens up moves to DOWN (to 8,8) or LEFT (to 7,9) next turn. It maintains my position in the \"safe zone\" (top-right) while slowly sliding along the top edge to the center-left. This forces the opponent to cross the entire board to engage, risking them eating their own tail or hitting walls.\n    -   **Cons:** I'm moving away from the immediate apples on the right side? Actually, looking at the board, the top row (9) has an apple at (1,9) and (6,8) is nearby. By moving to (8,9), I am closer to the center/top area where apples like (6,8) or (7,8) might be (though board shows A at 6,8? Yes!).\n    -   **Apple Check:** There is an apple at (6,8) and (1,9) on the top side. Moving to (8,9) puts me in range to grab (6,8) or (7,8) in a few turns.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n*Slither slowly along the top edge towards the center.* I want to bait the opponent into the center or top side where their bulky body will be a disadvantage. If they follow me up, they risk running into my tail or getting trapped. I need to watch their movement\u2014if they go UP, I might need to stay high. If they stay low, I can sweep the top row for apples. My goal is to hit 10 apples (tying) or 11 (leading) to gain psychological dominance.\n\n**Decision:**\nGo LEFT. It's the only safe move, and it keeps me alive and in position to dominate the top half of the board.\n\nChat, we are pivoting to the left! Let's see if they dare to follow us into the danger zone!\n\nLEFT",

I need to close the gap. This apple is right there, and it aligns me with the bottom side of the board.\n-   **Move LEFT to (6,9):** This moves me closer to the center top. It's safe, but I miss an immediate point.\n\n**Decision:**\nI must prioritize eating the apple. We are chasing the win, and every point counts. Going DOWN to (7,8) grows my snake and puts me at 10 apples. This also positions my head near the center-right, giving me access to the apples at (6,7) or (6,8) next turn.\n\n**Plan:**\nEat the apple at (7,8) to tie the score up. Then, prepare to either slide left along the 8th row or dip down further to clear out the right-side apples. The opponent is still stuck in the lower left corner; if I can clear the right side and grow big, I can loop back and box them in.\n\nChat, we're taking the free snack!

This brings me to 11 apples, further closing the gap to 12-11. It positions me closer to the vertical strip of apples on the left side of the center (like (6,7) and potentially (5,6) or (6,2) later).\n-   **DOWN to (7,7):** This is empty. While safe, it doesn't offer immediate scoring. It might align me with (6,7) or (7,6) next turn, but (7,6) is currently an apple 'A' (visible on the board as '.' in the map but listed in drops as (6,7) and (6,8) etc. Wait, looking at the board map: (7,6) is actually 'A' in the provided drop list but represented as '.' in the text map? Let's re-read the map.\n    - Map row 6: `. . . . . A . . . T`\n    - Map row 5: `. . A . . A . . . T`\n    - Map row 4: `. . 1 . T . . . . T`\n    - Map row 3: `. . T A T T . . T T`\n    - Map row 2: `. . T . T A T A . A .`\n    - Map row 1: `. A T . T T . A . A`\n    - Map row 0: `. . T T T . . A . .`\n\n    Checking coordinates agains the map:\n    (7,6) -> Row 6, Col 7. The string is `. . . . . A . . . T`. This is 10 characters? No, indices 0-9. Col 7 is the 8th character. `. . . . . A . . . T` -> Indices: 0 '.', 1 '.', 2 '.', 3 '.', 4 '.', 5 'A', 6 '.', 7 '.', 8 '.', 9 'T'. So (7,6) is '.'.\n    (6,7) -> Row 7, Col 6. Row 7: `. A . . . . A 0 T T`. Indices: 0 '.', 1 'A', 2 '.', 3 '.', 4 '.', 5 '.', 6 'A', 7 '0', 8 'T', 9 'T'. So (6,7) is 'A'.\n    (7,7) -> Row 7, Col 7. Indices: 0 '.', 1 'A', 2 '.', 3 '.', 4 '.', 5 '.', 6 'A', 7 '0', 8 'T', 9 'T'. So (7,7) is currently occupied by my own head (since the map is static? No, the map updates). The map shows my head at (7,8) currently (Row 8, Col 7 is '0'). Wait, the map in the prompt shows my head at (7,8)?\n    \n    Prompt Map:\n    Row 9: `. A . . . . . T T .`\n    Row 8: `. A . . . . A 0 T T`\n    \n    My head is at (7,8) (Col 7, Row 8). The map shows '0' at Col 7, Row 8. Correct.\n    \n    So (6,8) is the apple 'A' at Col 6, Row 8. This is a clear eat.\n    (7,7) is Col 7, Row 7. In the map Row 7 is `. A . . . . A 0 T T`. Wait, Row 7 shows a '0' at Col 7? No, Row 7 is index 7? The map rows are labeled 9 to 0 from top to bottom. So Row 8 is the second line. Row 7 is the third line. The third line is `. . . . . . A . . T`. This is Row 7.\n    So (7,7) is Row 7, Col 7. That is '.'.\n    \n    Okay, so (7,7) is empty. (6,8) is an apple.\n    \n    The choice is obvious. Eat the apple.\n\n**Decision:**\n**LEFT** to (6,8). I need the points to catch up to 12. The opponent is slow in the bottom left. I can sweep the right side/apples in the center. Moving left here is safe and productive.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (6,8). Then consider moving Down to (6,7) (which is also an apple) or Left to (5,8) to clear that row. I want to avoid getting pinned against the right wall by the opponent if they decide to sweep up, but they are currently far away. My body is long (11 segments), so I need to be careful not to trap myself. I should aim to create a loop or sweep pattern that keeps my tail moving out of the way.\n\n**Final Move:**\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

Gap is closing! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We ate the apple last turn at (7,8) -> moved LEFT to (6,8). Now we are sitting at (6,8) with an apple just eaten. Let's look at the board.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- **My Head:** (6, 8) (Just ate the apple here last turn, grew to 11 segments).\n- **My Body:** [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3)].\n- **Opponent Head:** (2, 5).\n- **Opponent Body:** [(2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)].\n\n**Safety Check (from Head at (6,8)):**\n1.  **UP to (6,9):**\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   **Body Check:** No.\n    -   **Opponent Check:** No.\n    -   **Board State:** (6,9) is '.' (Empty). **SAFE.**\n2.  **DOWN to (6,7):**\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   **Body Check:** No.\n    -   **Opponent Check:** No.\n    -   **Board State:** (6,7) contains an apple 'A'. **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (5,8):**\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   **Body Check:** No.\n    -   **Opponent Check:** No.\n    -   **Board State:** (5,8) is '.' (Empty). **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (7,8):**\n    -   Coordinates: Valid.\n    -   **Body Check:** (7,8) is currently my neck/first body segment. **DEAD (Self-collision).**\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n-   **UP to (6,9):** Moves me to the top edge. The opponent is currently at (2,5). If I go UP, I am moving away from the opponent and the center apples. This gives me control of the top row, but it might isolate me if the opponent decides to push up later.\n-   **DOWN to (6,7):** This is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Eating this brings me to 12 apples. The score would be 12 vs 13. Crucially, (6,7) is directly between my current position and the opponent's potential path. I would be sitting right on top of a key apple in the middle-left area. However, moving DOWN here puts my head at (6,7). Looking at the board map: Row 7 is `. . . . . . A . . T`. Wait, Row 7 is the 3rd line down from the top (index 7). The apple is at Col 6. So (6,7) is indeed an apple. Moving down here is an immediate score.\n-   **LEFT to (5,8):** This is empty. It keeps me on the horizontal line I'm currently on. It doesn't score immediately. (5,8) is safe, but (5,7) is an apple (looking at the map, (5,7) is Row 7, Col 5? No, (5,7) is Row 7, Col 5, which is '.'). Wait, where are the apples?\n    - (6,7) is an apple (Row 7, Col 6).\n    - (5,6) is an apple (Row 6, Col 5).\n    - (7,1) is an apple (Row 1, Col 7).\n    \n    If I move LEFT to (5,8), I am setting up for (5,7) next, but (5,7) is empty. I could aim for (5,6) later, but (5,6) is surrounded by obstacles or far.\n    \n    The apple at (6,7) is right under my nose. I am currently at (6,8). The apple is at (6,7). Taking it grows me to 12. The opponent is at (2,5). They are far enough that I don't think they can kill me immediately by moving into my body, and I am not moving towards them in a way that guarantees a head-on collision.\n    \n    However, moving DOWN to (6,7) puts my head at (6,7). My body will trail back to (7,8), (7,9), etc.\n    The opponent is at (2,5). If they move RIGHT to (3,5), they are still far.\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Box Him In\" strategy. The opponent is in the bottom left. I am on the right side. If I take the apple at (6,7), I am claiming the middle-left area. This effectively cuts the board in half vertically (around x=5 or x=6).\n    \n    If I move DOWN to (6,7):\n    - I get +1 point (12 total).\n    - I control the center-left.\n    - Next turn, from (6,7), I have options: LEFT to (5,7) (empty), DOWN to (6,6) (empty), RIGHT to (7,7) (empty), UP to (6,8) (my body, eventually).\n    \n    If I move UP to (6,9):\n    - I am at the top. The opponent is at the bottom. I can then try to loop around the right side.\n    - But I miss the apple at (6,7).\n    \n    If I move LEFT to (5,8):\n    - I don't score. I am moving away from the immediate apple (6,7).\n    \n    The opponent has 13 apples. I have 11. I NEED to catch up. The apple at (6,7) is guaranteed safety and a score. The opponent cannot reach (6,7) this turn because they are at (2,5) (distance 4 in x, 2 in y).\n    \n    Wait, looking at the opponent's position (2,5) and their body length. Their tail is at (4,4). They are filling up the bottom left.\n    If I go DOWN to (6,7), I am safe from collision because they are far.\n    \n    The only risk is if the opponent moves aggressively towards me, but they are slow.\n    \n    Let's double check the coordinates.\n    My head: (6,8).\n    Apple: (6,7).\n    Move: DOWN.\n    \n    Is there any trap?\n    My body: (7,8), (7,9), (8,9)... (8,3).\n    If I go DOWN to (6,7), my body moves to (6,8), then (7,8), etc.\n    \n    What if the opponent moves RIGHT to (3,5)?\n    What if the opponent moves UP to (2,6)?\n    They are still very far.\n    \n    The immediate goal is to close the score gap. 11 vs 13 is dangerous. If I get to 12, I am one apple away from tying.\n    \n    Consider the long term. I am at (6,8). My tail is at (8,3). My body snakes along the right side.\n    If I take (6,7), I am pulling my \"front\" towards the center.\n    The opponent is in the bottom left quadrant. By taking (6,7), I am effectively blocking their expansion to the right.\n    \n    Let's look at the apple list again.\n    (6,7) is there.\n    (5,6) is there.\n    (6,2) is there.\n    (5,5) is there.\n    \n    If I eat (6,7), I am close to (5,6) and (5,5).\n    \n    If I don't eat (6,7), and go UP or LEFT, I might let the opponent get closer to these apples if they decide to push up. But they are currently low.\n    \n    The biggest threat is the score. If I don't eat, I stay at 11. They are at 13.\n    \n    Let's assume the opponent moves optimally. They want to eat apples too. Where are the apples for them?\n    They are at (2,5). Apples near them: (1,9), (1,8), (1,3), (1,1).\n    They are far from the apples I am looking at.\n    \n    So, I should take the guaranteed apple.\n    \n    Is (6,7) guaranteed?\n    Head-on collision check:\n    Me: (6,7)\n    Opponent: Moves from (2,5).\n    Max movement: 2 squares in Manhattan distance? No, 1 square.\n    They can't reach (6,7) in one move.\n    \n    Body collision check:\n    Me into Opponent body?\n    Opponent body is mostly x=2, x=3, x=4, x=5. y is low (0-4).\n    (6,7) is clear.\n    \n    Me into My body?\n    My body is at (7,8), (7,9)... (8,3). (6,7) is not in my body.\n    \n    It is SAFE.\n    \n    Is it strategic?\n    Yes. It scores. It advances position. It cuts off the board.\n    \n    The only downside is if moving DOWN traps me later.\n    From (6,7), I can go LEFT (5,7), DOWN (6,6), RIGHT (7,7).\n    (6,6) is empty.\n    (5,7) is empty.\n    (7,7) is empty.\n    \n    So I have 3 exits from (6,7). It's not a trap.\n    \n    compared to moving UP to (6,9):\n    From (6,9), I can go LEFT (5,9), RIGHT (7,9), DOWN (6,8 - body).\n    (6,9) is on the edge. That limits mobility slightly.\n    \n    Compared to moving LEFT to (5,8):\n    From (5,8), I can go UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8).\n    (5,7) is empty.\n    (4,8) is empty.\n    (5,9) is empty.\n    This is also a good spot.\n    \n    But (5,8) doesn't score.\n    \n    I must score to catch up. The opponent has 13. I have 11.\n    \n    Decision: DOWN to eat the apple at (6,7).\n    This grows me to 12 apples.\n    \n    Wait, look at the board map provided in the prompt.\n    Row 7 (index 7): `. . . . . . A . . T`\n    Col 6 is 'A'.\n    My head is at (6,8).\n    Moving DOWN to (6,7) lands on 'A'.\n    \n    This is the correct play.\n    \n    Plan for next turn:\n    After eating at (6,7), I will be at (6,7).\n    Opponent will likely be moving towards the center or staying put.\n    From (6,7), I can look at (5,6) or (6,6) or (7,6).\n    (7,6) is empty.\n    (6,6) is empty.\n    (5,6) is an apple.\n    So from (6,7), going LEFT to (5,7) is empty, but then I can go DOWN to (5,6) to eat the next apple.\n    Or I can go DOWN to (6,6) and then LEFT to (5,6).\n    \n    The opponent is at (2,5).\n    If they move RIGHT, they are at (3,5).\n    If they move UP, they are at (2,6).\n    \n    I am effectively dominating the right side and center.\n    \n    One detail: The opponent has 13 apples. I have 11.\n    If I eat (6,7), I have 12.\n    I am still losing.\n    But I am getting closer.\n    \n    Let's check if there is a move that scores AND positions better.\n    LEFT to (5,8) -> no score.\n    UP to (6,9) -> no score.\n    DOWN to (6,7) -> score.\n    \n    So DOWN is the only scoring move.\n    \n    Is there a risk?\n    The opponent moves simultaneously.\n    Could the opponent be moving to (6,7)?\n    No. They are at (2,5). Distance is huge.\n    \n    Could the opponent move to a spot that kills me next turn?\n    If I go to (6,7), my tail moves to (7,8).\n    The opponent can't reach (6,7) or (7,8) next turn.\n    \n    So, DOWN is safe.\n    \n    Wait, look at the opponent's body again.\n    Body: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)].\n    They are definitely in the bottom left.\n    \n    My body is on the right.\n    By moving DOWN to (6,7), I am moving towards the center.\n    This creates a barrier.\n    \n    Let's verify the apple coordinates from the list provided in the prompt.\n    Apple Drops: (7, 0), (4, 2), (8, 2), (7, 1), (6, 7), (1, 9), (6, 2), (1, 8), (9, 1), (1, 1), (5, 5), (3, 3), (5, 6), (1, 3), (8, 5).\n    Yes, (6, 7) is in the list.\n    \n    I am confident in DOWN.\n    \n    Final check.\n    Head (6,8).\n    Move DOWN to (6,7).\n    Valid. Safe. Score.\n    \n    The opponent is at (2,5).\n    They have 13 apples.\n    I have 11.\n    I eat (6,7) -> 12 apples.\n    Gap is 1.\n    \n    Let's go.\n\n**Decision:**\n**DOWN** to (6,7). Eat the apple. Close the gap to 12-13. Control the center.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're back in the action! Turn 33 and the stakes are rising. We are currently trailing 12-13. We absolutely MUST close this gap. The opponent is holed up in the bottom left, but we have a golden opportunity right now to strike.\n\nLet's look at the board. My head is at **(6, 7)** (I just ate that apple last turn). The opponent is at **(3, 5)**. \n\nWait, hold up. Let me check the board state again. The prompt says my head is at **(6, 7)**. But the Board Map shows:\nRow 7 (y=7): `. . . . . . 0 . . T`\nThat is `(0,7)` to `(9,7)`. The `0` is at `(6,7)`. \nSo my head is currently at **(6, 7)**. The apple listed in the drops is **(6, 7)**. Wait, if I am at (6,7), and the apple is at (6,7), that means I just ate it last turn (Turn 32).\n\nSo, **Current State:**\n- **My Head:** (6, 7)\n- **My Body:** [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3)]\n- **Opponent Head:** (3, 5)\n- **Opponent Body:** [(2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3)]\n- **Apples Available:** (7, 0), (4, 2), (8, 2), (7, 1), (1, 9), (6, 2), (1, 8), (9, 1), (1, 1), (5, 5), (3, 3), (5, 6), (1, 3), (8, 5), (4, 9)\n\n**Scoring:**\n- Me: 12\n- Enemy: 13\n**GOAL:** Eat an apple to tie or take the lead.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (6, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):**\n    *   Coordinates: Valid.\n    *   **DEADLY:** This is my own body! (6, 8) is the second segment of my snake. \n    *   **Result:** Crash. \ud83d\udc80\n    *   **Eliminate.**\n\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 7):**\n    *   Coordinates: Valid.\n    *   **Safety:** \n        *   My Body: (6, 8), (7, 8)... (8, 3). (5, 7) is clear.\n        *   Opponent Body: Mostly x <= 5. (5, 7) is clear.\n        *   Opponent Head: (3, 5). Distance is safe.\n    *   **Score:** No apple. (5, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** Keeps me in the center. Opens up moves to (5, 6) (which has an apple!) or (4, 7).\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n    *   Coordinates: Valid.\n    *   **Safety:**\n        *   My Body: Clear.\n        *   Opponent Body: Clear.\n    *   **Score:** No apple. (7, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me deeper into the right side.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (6, 6):**\n    *   Coordinates: Valid.\n    *   **Safety:**\n        *   My Body: Clear.\n        *   Opponent Body: Clear.\n    *   **Score:** No apple. (6, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me down towards (6, 5), (6, 4).\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\nI am at 12 apples. Opponent is at 13. I need to eat.\n*   (6, 7) is empty (I just ate it).\n*   Apples nearby: \n    *   (5, 6) - Left and Down.\n    *   (6, 2) - Way down.\n    *   (5, 5) - Left and Down.\n    *   (8, 5) - Right and Down.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT to (5, 7):**\n    *   Leads to **(5, 6)** (Apple) next turn.\n    *   Leads to **(4, 7)** (Empty).\n    *   **Value:** HIGH. Positioning for a guaranteed apple next turn if safe. Also moves me closer to the opponent's zone to potentially block them.\n\n*   **DOWN to (6, 6):**\n    *   Leads to **(6, 5)** (Empty).\n    *   Leads to **(5, 6)** (Apple).\n    *   **Value:** MEDIUM/HIGH. Also positions for (5, 6) or (6, 5).\n\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n    *   Leads to **(7, 6)** (Empty) -> **(8, 5)** (Apple).\n    *   **Value:** MEDIUM. Longer path to the apple.\n\n**THE THREAT CHECK:**\nThe opponent is at (3, 5). They are low on apples and likely hunting. They have a long body filling the bottom left. \nIf I go **LEFT to (5, 7)**:\n*   I am at (5, 7).\n*   The opponent is at (3, 5).\n*   Can they reach me? No, not in one turn.\n*   Can they block my path to (5, 6)? If they move aggressively, they could try to intercept, but they are far.\n\nWait, looking at the apple list again: **(5, 6)** is an apple. \nIf I go **LEFT to (5, 7)**, next turn I can go **DOWN to (5, 6)** and eat.\nIf I go **DOWN to (6, 6)**, next turn I can go **LEFT to (5, 6)** and eat.\n\nBoth get me to the apple eventually. \nHowever, **LEFT** is safer long-term? \nFrom (5, 7), I have: (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 8).\nFrom (6, 6), I have: (6, 5), (7, 6), (5, 6).\n\nThe opponent is at (3, 5). Their range is expanding. \nI want to cut the board. Moving **LEFT** pushes my front line into the center/middle-left, effectively boxing the opponent into the bottom-left corner (x < 5). \n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nMy head at (6, 7). Enemy at (3, 5).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 7), and enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 5)... we are safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 7), and enemy moves UP to (3, 6)... safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 7), and enemy moves UP-RIGHT (impossible).\n\nThe safest path to the *next* apple (5, 6) is via **LEFT** or **DOWN**.\nLet's look at the board map.\nRow 7 (y=7): `. . . . . . 0 . . T`\n(5, 7) is `.` (Empty).\n(6, 6) is `.` (Empty).\n\nIs there an immediate trap?\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 7):\n- My body moves: Head (5, 7), then (6, 7), (6, 8)...\n- If the opponent moves to (6, 7) (impossible from 3,5), I die.\n- If I go LEFT, I am safer from the opponent's immediate expansion.\n\nLet's consider the score. 12 vs 13. I MUST eat. The apple at (5, 6) is the closest logical target.\nMoving LEFT puts me in a prime position to pivot to (5, 6) or (4, 6).\nMoving DOWN puts me in a position to pivot to (5, 6) or (6, 5).\n\nActually, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\nRow 6: `. . . . . A . . . T` -> (5, 6) is an apple.\nRow 5: `. . T 1 . A . . A T` -> (5, 5) is an apple.\n\nThe opponent is at (3, 5). They are very close to (4, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2).\nWait, (3, 3) is an apple. The opponent is at (3, 5). They can go DOWN to (3, 4) or (3, 3).\nIf they eat (3, 3), they extend their lead.\n\nI need to secure my own growth. (5, 6) is a safe bet.\nGoing **LEFT** to (5, 7) is the move. It sets up the apple at (5, 6) perfectly.\n\nOne final check.\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 7):\n- Safe from board edges.\n- Safe from my body.\n- Safe from enemy body.\n- Safe from enemy head (distance > 1).\n- Sets up apple (5, 6).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 6):\n- Safe.\n- Sets up (5, 6).\n- But moves me closer to the bottom edge, potentially limiting vertical mobility later if I get stuck.\n\n**LEFT** feels more commanding. It expands my territory into the center.\nLet's lock it in. I'm going for the setup on (5, 6).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\n1. Move LEFT to (5, 7).\n2. Next turn, target (5, 6) (Apple).\n3. Maintain the barrier against the enemy.\n\nChat, we're making a play! LEFT!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 34 and we are LOCKED IN! \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe are trailing 12-13, so we NEED to close this gap. The opponent is at (4, 5) and I'm at (5, 7). They have a long body blocking the bottom left, but they have apples in their reach like (3, 3) and (4, 2). I need to secure my own food while cutting off their expansion.\n\nLet's check the immediate threats and targets from my position **(5, 7)**:\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 8):** \n    *   Board check: `.` (Empty)\n    *   Safety: My body is at (6, 8), (7, 8)... so (5, 8) is clear. Opponent is far away at (4, 5).\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE. \n    *   **Pros:** Opens up (5, 9) (Apple!) and keeps me in the top row to dominate the right side.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 6):**\n    *   Board check: `A` (Apple!)\n    *   Safety: My body is at (6, 7)... so (5, 6) is clear. Opponent is at (4, 5), so (5, 6) is NOT their body.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE + FOOD.\n    *   **Pros:** Eats an apple immediately! Ties the score 13-13.\n    *   **Cons:** The apple is there, but is it a trap? Looking at the board, (5, 6) is surrounded. If I eat here, my tail moves from (8, 3) to (6, 7). That keeps the path open. \n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 7):**\n    *   Board check: `.` (Empty)\n    *   Safety: Safe from my body. Opponent is at (4, 5) and (4, 0)... so (4, 7) is clear.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves towards the center.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n    *   Board check: `.` (Empty, was my old head spot)\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE.\n    *   **Pros:** Keeps me on the right edge.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need points. I'm at 12, they are at 13. The apple at **(5, 6)** is RIGHT THERE. \nIf I go **DOWN**:\n- I eat the apple. Score becomes 13-13. Tied!\n- My head moves to (5, 6).\n- My body becomes [(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8)...].\n- This solidifies my presence in the mid-field.\n\nWhy not UP to (5, 9)? (5, 9) is also an apple! But looking closer at the board map for Row 9: `. A . . A . . T T .` -> (5, 9) is empty, (4, 9) is Apple. Wait, the prompt says Apple drops: (5, 5), (5, 6)... Let me double check Row 9 from the map:\nRow 9: `9 . A . . A . . T T .`\nx=0: `.`\nx=1: `A`\nx=2: `.`\nx=3: `.`\nx=4: `A`\nx=5: `.`\nx=6: `.`\nx=7: `T`\nx=8: `T`\nx=9: `.`\n\nSo (5, 9) is EMPTY. (4, 9) is Apple. So UP to (5, 8) doesn't lead to an immediate apple. It leads to (5, 8) -> (5, 9) (Empty) or (4, 8) (Empty).\n\nMeanwhile, **DOWN to (5, 6)** is a GUARANTEED apple. \nTying the score is crucial. Once I'm tied at (5, 6), I can look at (4, 9) or (4, 2) or (8, 5). \n\nLet's look at the opponent. They are at (4, 5). If I go DOWN to (5, 6), they are at (4, 5). They are NOT at (5, 6). They cannot kill me this turn. They can move to (3, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), or (4, 4). \nIf they move to (5, 5) (which is an apple!), they get further ahead.\nIf they move to (4, 6), they are adjacent to my new head (5, 6). That's a standoff.\nIf they move to (3, 5), they are safe.\n\nI must eat. **DOWN** is the play.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (5, 6) to tie the score 13-13. From (5, 6), I will pivot to target (4, 9) or circle back to the apples at (8, 5) or (9, 1). I must watch the opponent's move to (4, 6) and prepare to counter-block.\n\nLet's get this bread.\n\nDOWN",

My score is now **13**. The opponent is still at **14**. I need to catch up!\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n- **My Head:** (5, 6)\n- **My Body:** [(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3)]\n- **Opponent Head:** (5, 5) (Moved DOWN from (4, 5) last turn!)\n- **Opponent Body:** [(4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\nThe opponent is at (5, 5). That is DIRECTLY BELOW ME at (5, 6). If I move **DOWN** to (5, 5), we head-on collide. He has 14 apples, I have 13. If we collide, I lose. **DOWN IS DEATH.**\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (5, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):**\n    *   Board Check: `(5, 7)` is part of my own body (the segment immediately behind my head).\n    *   Rule: Moving into your own body is death.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEAD.** Do not go UP.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 6):**\n    *   Board Check: Looking at the map, (4, 6) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Safety: Is it clear of enemy? Opponent is at (5, 5). Their body runs from (4, 5) down to (5, 3). (4, 6) is NOT part of their body.\n    *   Future Options:\n        *   From (4, 6), I can go UP to (4, 7) [Empty],\n        *   DOWN to (4, 5) [Opponent's BODY segment - wait, is it? Yes, (4, 5) is their neck].\n        *   LEFT to (3, 6) [Empty].\n        *   RIGHT to (5, 6) [My tail will move, so it'll be open? No, that's where I am now. If I go LEFT, my tail moves from (9, 3) to (5, 7). (5, 6) becomes empty.]\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE.** Good maneuvering position.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):**\n    *   Board Check: Looking at the map, (6, 6) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Safety: Clear of my body. Clear of enemy body.\n    *   Future Options:\n        *   From (6, 6), I can go UP to (6, 7) [My body segment - DEATH],\n        *   DOWN to (6, 5) [Empty],\n        *   LEFT to (5, 6) [My tail will be here eventually],\n        *   RIGHT to (7, 6) [Empty].\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE.**\n\n4.  **DOWN to (5, 5):**\n    *   Board Check: The opponent is literally standing there.\n    *   **Verdict:** **HEAD-ON COLLISION.** Since he has 14 and I have 13, **I LOSE.** Instant death.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI cannot go UP (suicide) or DOWN (collision with higher score). I must go LEFT or RIGHT.\n- Going **LEFT to (4, 6)** keeps me relatively central and puts distance between me and the opponent's head (5, 5).\n- Going **RIGHT to (6, 6)** moves me towards the right side of the board, but (6, 7) is my body, so my mobility is slightly more restricted to the right (I can't go UP).\n\nHowever, I need to check if the opponent can reach me next turn if I move LEFT. If I go to (4, 6), opponent is at (5, 5). They can move to (5, 6) (my old spot), (4, 5) (their body), (6, 5) (empty), or (5, 4).\nIf they move to (5, 6), they are adjacent to (4, 6). Not an immediate kill unless they move into me next turn.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (6, 6)**, opponent at (5, 5) can move to (6, 5). We would be adjacent at (6, 6) and (6, 5).\n\nWait, looking at the apples on the board map:\n- (4, 9) is an Apple.\n- (3, 3) is an Apple.\n- (8, 5) is an Apple.\n\nFrom (5, 6):\n- (4, 6) is closer to (3, 3) and (4, 9) (via the top left).\n- (6, 6) is closer to (8, 5) and (9, 1).\n\nI need to close the gap of 1 point. I should go for an apple.\n(8, 5) is an apple. From (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 5).\n(3, 3) is an apple. From (5, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3).\n\nThe opponent is at (5, 5). They are very close to (3, 3) and (4, 2).\nActually, look at the opponent's potential moves. If they go for (5, 5) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 3)... they are just moving down their own body?\nWait, their body is [(4, 5), (3, 5)...]. So (5, 5) is empty? No, (5, 5) is their HEAD.\nTheir tail is at (5, 3). So they can't go DOWN to (5, 4) effectively because they might block themselves?\nWait, if they move DOWN to (5, 4), their tail moves from (5, 3) to (4, 5). So (5, 4) becomes safe for them.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nThe opponent is aggressive. They moved from (4, 5) to (5, 5). They are trying to cut me off.\nIf I go **LEFT to (4, 6)**, I open up (3, 6). The opponent at (5, 5) can move to (5, 6). We would be side-by-side.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (6, 6)**, I open up (7, 6). The opponent at (5, 5) can move to (5, 6) (my old spot).\n\nActually, let's look at the collision rules carefully.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 6):\n- My head: (4, 6)\n- Opponent head: (5, 5)\n- Safe.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 6):\n- My head: (6, 6)\n- Opponent head: (5, 5)\n- Safe.\n\nWhy choose LEFT?\n(4, 6) is safer. Why? Because (6, 6) is next to (6, 7) which is MY body. If I go RIGHT to (6, 6), my next move UP is blocked by my own body. My only options are LEFT (back), DOWN, or RIGHT.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 6), I have UP (4, 7), LEFT (3, 6), or DOWN (4, 5 - opponent body... wait, (4, 5) is opponent's body *now*, but if he moves, it clears up).\n\nLet's reconsider the opponent's move. They are at (5, 5). They want to eat apples too.\nApples near them: (4, 2) and (3, 3).\nIf they go DOWN, they are moving toward (4, 2).\nIf they go LEFT, they go to (4, 5) (their own body).\nIf they go RIGHT, they go to (6, 5).\nIf they go UP, they go to (5, 6).\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (4, 6)**:\n- If opponent goes UP to (5, 6), we are adjacent. Safe.\n- If opponent goes RIGHT to (6, 5), we are diagonal. Safe.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (6, 6)**:\n- If opponent goes UP to (5, 6), we are adjacent. Safe.\n- If opponent goes RIGHT to (6, 5), we are adjacent. Safe.\n\nBoth are safe. Which one gives me better board control?\n(4, 6) leads to the top-left quadrant where there are apples at (4, 9) and (3, 9).\n(6, 6) leads to the right side where there are apples at (8, 5) and (9, 1).\n\nI need to close the score gap. The opponent has 14, I have 13.\nThe apple at (4, 9) is blocked by T's on the top row (7, 8)... actually looking at the map:\nRow 9: `. A . . A . . T T .`\n(4, 9) is Apple.\n(8, 9) and (7, 9) are T (Trash/Body).\nSo to get to (4, 9), I need to go through (4, 7) -> (4, 8) -> (4, 9).\nFrom (4, 6), this is a straight shot up the Y-axis.\n\nTo get to (8, 5) from (6, 6):\n(6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 5).\n(8, 5) is an apple. Is it safe?\nLooking at the map, (8, 5) is `.` (Empty).\n\nWait, look at the opponent's position (5, 5). They are very close to (4, 2) and (3, 3).\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving towards the center. The opponent is likely to chase the closer apples at (4, 2) or (3, 3).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving away from the opponent towards the right edge.\n\nIs there a trap on the right?\nMy body runs down the right side: (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3).\nThe right side is packed with MY body.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 6), I am entering a narrow corridor between my own body (the wall of T's) and the edge.\nFrom (6, 6):\n- UP: (6, 7) is MY body.\n- DOWN: (6, 5) is Empty.\n- LEFT: (5, 6) is Empty (my tail moves).\n- RIGHT: (7, 6) is Empty.\nIt's playable, but risky. If I get forced down, I might hit my own tail.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 6):\n- UP: (4, 7) is Empty.\n- DOWN: (4, 5) is Opponent Body (but they might move).\n- LEFT: (3, 6) is Empty.\n- RIGHT: (5, 6) is Empty.\nThis area is much more open. I have more escape routes.\n\nAlso, consider the \"boxing in\" strategy. The opponent is at (5, 5). If I move LEFT, I force them to make a decision.\nIf I stay central, I can react to their move.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (8, 5) again. It's surrounded by potential body blocks.\nActually, look at the opponent's path. They have a long body. If they turn around to chase me to the right, they have to navigate their own tail.\nMy tail is at (9, 3). If I go RIGHT, I move towards (9, 1) (Apple).\nIf I go LEFT, I move towards (1, 9) (Apple) or (3, 9).\n\nLet's look at the board map again to be sure about (4, 6) and (6, 6).\nMap:\nRow 6: `6 . . . . . 0 . . . T`\nMy head is at (5, 6).\n(4, 6) is `.` (Row 6, col 4).\n(6, 6) is `.` (Row 6, col 6).\n\nI am currently at 13 apples. Opponent at 14.\nI need to force a win. If I move LEFT, I gain control of the center-left.\nIf I move RIGHT, I hug my own body.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will go **LEFT**.\nWhy?\n1.  **Safety:** It moves me away from the opponent's head (5, 5) and keeps me in the open central area.\n2.  **Offense:** It sets me up to chase the apples at (4, 9) or (3, 3) depending on the opponent's move.\n3.  **Defense:** It prevents me from getting trapped against my own body on the right side. My body is a wall on the right; I shouldn't corner myself there when the opponent is aggressive in the center.\n\nI am moving to (4, 6). The opponent is at (5, 5).\nIf they move UP to (5, 6), I am at (4, 6). We are safe.\nIf they move RIGHT to (6, 5), I am at (4, 6). Safe.\nIf they move DOWN to (5, 4), I am at (4, 6). Safe.\n\nI am securing the left side of the board. Let's see if they try to block me.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (4, 6) to secure central positioning and open up the route to the top-left apples (4, 9). Watch the opponent's move to (5, 6) or (6, 5). If they commit to the bottom, I rush the top. If they chase me, I use my tail length to loop around them.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

We are at **Head: (4, 6)** (based on the map in the prompt, assuming the coordinate list had a typo or the map is the source of truth). Actually, looking closely, the prompt says \"Head: (4, 6)\" in the text description of my snake, but the map shows `0` at `(5, 6)` in the previous turn's context. Wait, let's look at the \"YOUR LAST MOVE\" section.\n\n**LAST TURN REVIEW:**\nI was at `(5, 6)`.\nI chose to move **LEFT**.\nThe rationale said: \"I will go LEFT. Why? ... I am moving to (4, 6).\"\nSo my current head should be **(4, 6)**.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\nMap Row 6: `6 . . . . . T . . . T` (Wait, the map shows `.` at `(4,6)` and `(5,6)`? No, the map in the prompt has `0` at `(5,6)` in the previous turn's description. Let's look at the map provided *now*:\n`6 . . . . 0 T . . . T`\nThe map shows `0` at `(5, 6)`? Or is that the old map?\nWait, the prompt says:\n`--YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP):--`\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n...\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n... \"I am moving to (4, 6).\"\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nIf I moved LEFT from `(5, 6)`, I am now at **(4, 6)**.\nLet's look at the board map provided in the current prompt.\nRow 6: `6 . . . . 0 T . . . T`\nThis map seems to show the `0` at `(5, 6)`? Or is the map static from the start of turn 36?\nActually, the map is the \"BOARD STATE\".\nIf the map shows `0` at `(5, 6)`, but I *thought* I moved left...\nLet's look at the map again carefully:\nRow 5: `5 . . T T T T 1 . A T` (Snake #1 is at (6,5))\nRow 6: `6 . . . . 0 T . . . T`\n\nWait, if Snake #1 is at (6,5) and I am at (4,6) [after moving left], the map should show `0` at (4,6).\nBut the map shows `0` at (5,6) (the 5th dot in row 6 is `0`).\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nRow 6: `.` (0), `.` (1), `.` (2), `.` (3), `.` (4), `0` (5), `T` (6)...\nSo the map shows `0` at `(5, 6)`.\nThis implies I did NOT move left? Or the map is just a visual representation of where I *was* at the start of the turn?\n\n**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:**\nThe prompt says \"Turn: 36 / 150\".\nThen it gives the Board State.\nUsually, the Board State reflects the CURRENT position.\nHowever, the \"YOUR LAST MOVE\" section details what I did on Turn 35.\nOn Turn 35, I was at `(5, 6)` (Head: (5,6) from previous turn data).\nI moved **LEFT** to `(4, 6)`.\nTherefore, at the start of Turn 36, I should be at **(4, 6)**.\nIf the map shows `0` at `(5, 6)`, the map might be slightly off or representing the \"visual\" before my move? No, that makes no sense.\nLet's look at the text description of my snake:\n`Head: (4, 6)`\n`Body: [(5, 6), ...]`\nOkay, the TEXT description confirms: **Head is (4, 6)**.\nThe MAP visual in the prompt might be slightly inaccurate or lagging, but the Text Description is the definitive source of truth for coordinates.\nSo:\n**My Head:** (4, 6)\n**My Body:** (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7)...\n**Enemy Head:** (6, 5)\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (4, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):**\n    *   Board Map Row 7: `7 . . . . . T T . . T`\n    *   (4, 7) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Is it my body? No. (5, 7) is my body, but (4, 7) is empty.\n    *   Is it enemy body? Enemy body is around (5,5), (4,5)... (4, 7) is clear.\n    *   **Safe.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):**\n    *   Board Map Row 5: `5 . . T T T T 1 . A T`\n    *   (4, 5) is `T` (Trash/Body). Specifically, it looks like the enemy's body runs through here? No, wait.\n    *   Enemy Head: (6, 5).\n    *   Enemy Body: [(5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5)...]\n    *   So (4, 5) is definitely part of the **Enemy's Body**.\n    *   Moving into enemy body = DEATH.\n    *   **DEAD.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):**\n    *   Board Map Row 6: `6 . . . . 0 T . . . T`\n    *   Wait, the map shows `(5, 6)` as `0`? No, `(3, 6)` is the 4th dot in the list (0-indexed).\n    *   Row 6: `.` (0), `.` (1), `.` (2), `.` (3), `.` (4), `0` (5)...\n    *   So `(3, 6)` is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Is it my body? No.\n    *   Is it enemy body? Enemy is at x=5,6. Body is at x=4,5... (3,6) is clear.\n    *   **Safe.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):**\n    *   Map shows `0` at `(5, 6)`? No, that's where I came from.\n    *   (5, 6) is currently my body (the neck).\n    *   If I move RIGHT, I hit my own body.\n    *   **DEAD.**\n\n**SUMMARY OF SAFE MOVES:**\n*   **UP (4, 7)**\n*   **LEFT (3, 6)**\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am at (4, 6). Enemy is at (6, 5).\nIf I go UP to (4, 7):\n- I get closer to the apples at (4, 9) and (3, 9).\n- I move away from the enemy's horizontal line of attack.\n- From (4, 7), I can go LEFT, UP, or RIGHT (back to 5,7 which is safe eventually). It's open.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 6):\n- I get closer to (3, 3) (Apple).\n- I am moving towards the center-left.\n- However, looking at the map, (3, 6) is a bit isolated. Below it is (3, 5) which is Enemy Body.\n- If I go LEFT to (3, 6), my options next turn are:\n    - UP to (3, 7) [Map Row 7: `.`]\n    - DOWN to (3, 5) [Enemy Body - DEATH]\n    - LEFT to (2, 6) [Map Row 6: `.`]\n    - RIGHT to (4, 6) [My tail will have moved].\n- So (3, 6) is safe, but DOWN is blocked by enemy body.\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 7):\n- My options next turn are:\n    - UP to (4, 8) [Map Row 8: `.`]\n    - DOWN to (4, 6) [My tail]\n    - LEFT to (3, 7) [Map Row 7: `.`]\n    - RIGHT to (5, 7) [My body - blocked]\n- So from (4, 7), I can go UP or LEFT. Both are good.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n(4, 7) vs (3, 6).\nThe enemy is at (6, 5). They are moving towards the bottom or center.\nI want to secure the top-left area.\n(4, 7) is a direct path up the Y-axis to the apples at (4, 9).\n(3, 6) requires zig-zagging.\n\nAlso, consider the \"Boxing in\" strategy.\nThe enemy is at (6, 5). If I go UP to (4, 7), I am putting a \"wall\" of my body (currently at 5,6 -> 5,7...) between me and the enemy's likely path upwards.\nActually, my body is currently at (5, 6) and (5, 7).\nIf I go UP to (4, 7), I am adjacent to my body at (5, 7).\nThis creates a diagonal block.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\nApple at (4, 9).\nFrom (4, 6) -> UP -> (4, 7).\nFrom (4, 7) -> UP -> (4, 8).\nFrom (4, 8) -> UP -> (4, 9).\nIt's a straight shot 3 turns away.\nIf I go LEFT, I detour.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (6, 5). They have 14 apples. I have 13.\nI need to catch up.\nThe apple at (4, 9) is very safe. It's surrounded by my potential body path and board edges.\nThe apple at (3, 3) is closer to the enemy (Manhattan distance: |6-3| + |5-3| = 3+2=5) vs (4,9) (|6-4| + |5-9| = 2+4=6). They are roughly equidistant, but (3, 3) is more open space.\n\nHowever, my body is already forming a wall on the right side.\nIf I go UP, I extend my vertical dominance on the left-center.\nIf I go LEFT, I enter the crowded center.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will move **UP** to (4, 7).\nWhy?\n1.  **Safety:** It avoids the enemy body at (4, 5) and my own body at (5, 6).\n2.  **Pathing:** It creates a clear path to the safe apple at (4, 9).\n3.  **Control:** It keeps me on the \"high ground\" (top of board) where I have more space to maneuver compared to the bottom where the enemy is currently located.\n4.  **Blockade:** My body at (5, 6) and (5, 7) acts as a partial shield if the enemy tries to chase me up.\n\nLet's rock it.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

We are LIVE on Turn 37 and the pressure is mounting! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's analyze the battlefield from our current position.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 6)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (6, 5)\n*   **Score:** Me 13 vs Enemy 14. We are down by 1 apple! I need to be aggressive but smart.\n*   **Board State:** We are in a \"U\" shaped corridor. My body is currently blocking the path to the East (Right), forming a wall.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1.  **DOWN (to 4, 5):**\n    *   Looking at the map: Row 5 shows `5 . . T T T T 1 . A T`.\n    *   Coordinates (4, 5) is occupied by the Enemy's body (it connects the chain of T's).\n    *   **VERDICT: DEATH.** I cannot move there.\n\n2.  **RIGHT (to 5, 6):**\n    *   I just came from (5, 6). My body is currently occupying (5, 6) as the \"neck\".\n    *   **VERDICT: DEATH.** Hitting my own body.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 6):**\n    *   The map shows `.` (Empty).\n    *   It is safe. However, looking at the map, (3, 5) below me is Enemy territory.\n    *   If I go LEFT, my available moves next turn would be:\n        *   UP to (3, 7)\n        *   LEFT to (2, 6)\n        *   *DOWN to (3, 5) is blocked by Enemy.*\n    *   This puts me in a position where I am \"skirting\" the enemy's vertical line. It's safe, but I'm boxing myself against the left edge of the enemy's territory.\n\n4.  **UP (to 4, 7):**\n    *   The map shows `.` (Empty).\n    *   It is safe.\n    *   My body is currently at (5, 7), so I am moving adjacent to my own tail.\n    *   If I go UP, my available moves next turn are:\n        *   UP to (4, 8)\n        *   LEFT to (3, 7)\n    *   Crucially, looking at the apples at (4, 9), (3, 9), and (3, 8), moving UP aligns me perfectly with the top-left cluster. (4, 9) is a straight shot up from here.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI am at (4, 6). The enemy is at (6, 5). The enemy is moving into the open space to the East or trying to navigate the bottom-right.\nBy moving **UP**, I secure the \"High Ground\" on the left side of the board. This blocks the enemy from easily reaching the apples at (4, 9) and (3, 9) without crossing my path.\nMoving **LEFT** is safe, but it compresses my movement options against the enemy's wall.\n**UP** opens up the vertical space and gives me a clear path to the next apple cluster.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (4, 9) by moving UP twice. From (4, 8), I can pivot LEFT to (3, 8) or UP to (4, 9) depending on the enemy's reaction. Force the enemy into the bottom-right corner where they have less maneuverability.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am moving **UP** to (4, 7) to claim the vertical axis and head toward the apple at (4, 9).\n\nUP",

The enemy is deep in the bottom-right.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 9):**\n    *   Map shows `A` (Apple).\n    *   **VERDICT:** SAFE and HIGH PRIORITY. I eat the apple, grow, and get closer to the enemy's score.\n    *   **Future:** From (4, 9), I'll be at the top edge. Moves would be DOWN (4, 8 - my current body, safe as it will move), LEFT (3, 9 - Apple), or RIGHT (5, 9 - Empty). Great options.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 7):**\n    *   Map shows `T` (My body). Specifically, (4, 7) is part of my tail.\n    *   **VERDICT:** DEATH. I cannot move into my own body. Wait, looking at my body list: Head (4,8), Body (4,7) is the immediate next segment. Moving DOWN is moving backwards into my own neck. DEAD.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 8):**\n    *   Map shows `T` (My body). (3, 8) is part of my tail section.\n    *   **VERDICT:** DEATH. Hitting my own body.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 8):**\n    *   Map shows `.` (Empty).\n    *   **VERDICT:** SAFE.\n    *   **Future:** From (5, 8), I'm squeezing through my own wall. Next moves would be UP (5, 9 - Empty), DOWN (5, 7 - My body), LEFT (4, 8 - My body), or RIGHT (6, 8 - My body). I'd be boxed in with only one move (UP). That's a trap.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe choice is between **UP** to (4, 9) or **RIGHT** to (5, 8).\n*   **RIGHT** leads me into a dead end or a squeeze play against my own tail. I lose momentum.\n*   **UP** gives me a guaranteed apple and keeps me in control of the top-left quadrant.\n*   Since the enemy is in the bottom-right and we are the same length (14 segments), securing an apple is critical. Moving UP prevents the enemy from easily grabbing that apple later if they loop around.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (4, 9). Pivot LEFT to (3, 9) or (3, 8) to secure the next apple cluster. Maintain board control and pressure the enemy. If they approach, be ready for a head-on collision since I'm hungry for points.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am moving **UP** to (4, 9) to secure the apple and grow.\n\nUP",

We just moved UP to (4, 9), ate an apple, and now our head is at (4, 9) with a long tail snaking down to (9, 6). The enemy is at (8, 6) and is pretty long too. Our board state shows a lot of open space in the middle and top, but we need to be aggressive and not get boxed in by our own tail.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the immediate moves from (4, 9):\n\n**1. UP:** (4, 10) \u2192 Out of bounds. Instant death. \ud83d\udeab\n\n**2. DOWN:** (4, 8) \u2192 Currently empty on the board? Wait, looking at our body list: Head is (4, 9), body starts at (4, 8). So (4, 8) is our own body segment. Moving DOWN into (4, 8) is moving into our own body. DEAD. \ud83d\udeab\n\n**3. LEFT:** (3, 9) \u2192 Board shows an 'A' (Apple) at (3, 9). But is it safe? Let\u2019s check the board state. The board at row 9 is: `. A . A 0 . . T T .`  \n- Column 3 (Left of 4) is indeed an Apple ('A').  \n- However, we must consider the enemy\u2019s move. The enemy head is at (8, 6). If they move UP to (8, 7), that\u2019s currently a 'T' (our tail?). Actually, (8, 7) is part of our tail (from our body list: (8, 8), (8, 9)? Wait, our tail is at (9, 6). Our body wraps around the top-right.  \nLet's map our body clearly:  \n(4,9) Head  \n(4,8)  \n(4,7)  \n(4,6)  \n(5,6)  \n(5,7)  \n(6,7)  \n(6,8)  \n(7,8)  \n(7,9)  \n(8,9)  \n(8,8)  \n(9,8)  \n(9,7)  \n(9,6) Tail  \nSo (8, 7) is NOT in our body. The board says 'T' at (8,7)? Let's check the board grid again.  \nRow 7: `. . . . T T T . . T` \u2192 (8,7) is '.' (Empty).  \nRow 8: `. A . A T . T T T T` \u2192 (8,8) is 'T'.  \nRow 9: `. A . A 0 . . T T .` \u2192 (8,9) is 'T'.  \nSo (8,7) is empty.  \nIf Enemy moves UP to (8,7), they are safe from hitting us. But if they move LEFT to (7,6) or RIGHT to (9,6)? (9,6) is our tail!  \nIf Enemy moves to (9,6), they hit our tail (and die), but our head moves to (3,9). That doesn't affect our immediate safety.  \nIs (3,9) safe from Enemy head collision? Enemy is at (8,6). Can they reach (3,9) in one move? No, max distance is 1 cell. (3,9) is far away.  \nSo LEFT into (3,9) is safe from collision.  \nBut wait, there's an apple there. Eating it is good, but let's check if we get trapped.\n\n**4. RIGHT:** (5, 9) \u2192 Board shows '.' (Empty).  \nIs it safe? (5,9) is currently empty.  \nEnemy is at (8,6), far away.  \nNo body parts there.  \nThis is safe.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\n- **LEFT to (3,9)** gets us an apple (+1 score, grows us).  \n  Potential next moves from (3,9):  \n  UP -> Out of bounds (3,10) - Dead end eventually.  \n  DOWN -> (3,8). Board shows 'A' at (3,8) (Row 8: `. A . A T...` -> Column 3 is 'A').  \n  LEFT -> (2,9). Board shows '.' (Row 9: `. A . A...` -> Col 2 is '.').  \n  RIGHT -> (4,9) - Will be empty as we leave it.  \n  So from (3,9), we have DOWN (Apple), LEFT (Empty), RIGHT (Empty). Three options. Good.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,9)** does not get us an apple.  \n  Potential next moves from (5,9):  \n  UP -> Out of bounds.  \n  DOWN -> (5,8). Board shows 'T' at (5,8) (Row 8: `. A . A T...` -> Col 5 is 'T'). That's our own body!  \n  LEFT -> (4,9) (Empty).  \n  RIGHT -> (6,9). Board shows '.' (Row 9: `. A . A 0 . . T T .` -> Col 6 is '.').  \n  So from (5,9), we have LEFT and RIGHT. Only 2 options. And DOWN is blocked by our own body.\n\n**Comparison:**\nLEFT gives us an apple AND better future mobility (3 options vs 2).  \nRIGHT is safe but starves us of points and leads to a slightly tighter spot.\n\n**The Goal:**\nWe are down by 1 apple. We NEED to eat. The apple at (3,9) is ripe for the taking.  \nIs there any threat?  \nCould the enemy try to cut us off? They are far.  \nCould we crash into the enemy? They are at (8,6). They could move UP to (8,7) or UP-LEFT etc, but (3,9) is far.  \nCould the enemy head move to (3,9)? Impossible distance.\n\n**Verdict:**\nMove **LEFT** to (3,9). Secure the apple. Increase score to 15. Tie the game. Maintain flexibility.\n\nWait, I should double check the board for (3,9). The board representation shows row 9 as:\n`. A . A 0 . . T T .`\nIndices: 0:., 1:A, 2:., 3:A, 4:0, 5:., 6:., 7:T, 8:T, 9:.\nSo at index 3, it's 'A'. Correct.\n\nWhat about (2,9) (Left of 3,9)?\nIndex 2 is '.'.\nWhat about (3,8) (Down from 3,9)?\nRow 8: `. A . A T . T T T T`\nIndex 3 is 'A'.\nSo (3,8) is an apple. Nice.\n\nIs there any scenario where moving LEFT kills us?\nIf Enemy moves to (3,9)? No.\nIf Enemy moves to (2,9)? No.\nIf we hit our own body? No.\nIf we go out of bounds? No.\n\nIs there any scenario where moving RIGHT is better?\nOnly if (3,9) was blocked or dangerous. It's not.\nWe need apples to catch up. We take the apple.\n\nOne detail: \"If you crash into him, you lose. If he crashes into you, he loses.\"\nHe is at (8,6). We are at (4,9).\nDistance is 5 squares x and 3 squares y. Safe.\n\nDecision: **LEFT**.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're at (4, 9) and we need to make a move. Score is 14 vs 15. We are down one apple. We need to eat.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n1.  **UP:** (4, 10) \u2192 Out of bounds. DEAD. \u274c\n2.  **DOWN:** (4, 8) \u2192 Our own body is there (the segment right below head). DEAD. \u274c\n3.  **LEFT:** (3, 9) \u2192 Board shows 'A' (Apple). Is it safe?\n    *   Enemy is at (8, 6). Distance is huge. No collision risk.\n    *   No walls.\n    *   No self-collision.\n    *   **Pros:** Eats an apple. Ties the score 15-15. From (3, 9), we have moves DOWN to (3, 8) [Apple], LEFT to (2, 9) [Empty], RIGHT to (4, 9) [Empty]. 3 safe options. Great mobility.\n4.  **RIGHT:** (5, 9) \u2192 Board shows '.' (Empty).\n    *   Safe from collision/walls.\n    *   **Cons:** No apple. Score stays 14 vs 15. We fall further behind. From (5, 9), moves are LEFT to (4, 9) or RIGHT to (6, 9). DOWN is blocked by our own body at (5, 8). Only 2 options. We get squeezed.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe are down by 1. We MUST take the apple to stay in the game. The apple at (3, 9) is uncontested and leads to a better board position (access to another apple at (3, 8)). Moving RIGHT is passive and starves us.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **LEFT** to (3, 9) to eat the apple and tie the score.\n\nLEFT\n**END RATIONALE**",

Currently safe.\n4. **DOWN:** (3, 8) \u2192 Board shows 'A' (Apple). Currently safe.\n\nOkay, we have three safe moves: RIGHT, LEFT, and DOWN.\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 9):** This moves us away from the enemy who is currently at (7, 6). It's safe, but it doesn't gain us an apple. We stay at 15 apples.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 9):** This moves us to the left edge. It's safe, but also no apple. From there, we'd be forced DOWN eventually or trapped against the wall.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 8):** This grabs an apple! Score goes to 16, we grow. From (3, 8), the board shows we have a clear path. Let's check what's around (3, 8).\n    *   (3, 8) is the Apple.\n    *   (3, 7) is empty (Row 7: `.` at col 3).\n    *   (2, 8) is empty (Row 8: `. A . A T...` at col 2 is `.`).\n    *   (4, 8) is our body, but we are leaving (3, 9), so (4, 9) becomes empty, but (4, 8) is still body. Wait, from (3, 8), we can go LEFT to (2, 8), DOWN to (3, 7), or UP to (3, 9) (which we just left). All are open.\n\n**The Play:**\nWe are tied in score. We need to pull ahead. The apple at (3, 8) is right there for the taking. Taking it puts us at 16 apples, giving us a lead over Snake #1. The enemy is at (7, 6), which is far enough away that they can't reach us in one turn. Moving DOWN is safe, scores a point, and maintains good board position.\n\nLet's secure the lead.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We just ate at (3, 9) and tied the score 15-15. Now we look at the board. We are at (3, 9).\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n1.  **UP:** (3, 10) \u2192 Out of bounds. DEAD. \u274c\n2.  **RIGHT:** (4, 9) \u2192 Empty. Safe, but no apple. We stay tied 15-15.\n3.  **LEFT:** (2, 9) \u2192 Empty. Safe, but no apple. We stay tied 15-15.\n4.  **DOWN:** (3, 8) \u2192 Board shows 'A' (Apple). Safe from collision (Enemy is at (7, 6)). No self-collision.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe need to take the lead. The apple at (3, 8) is free real estate. Taking it puts us at 16 apples, 1 ahead of Snake #1. From (3, 8), we have multiple exit routes: (3, 7) or (2, 8). The enemy is too far to contest this.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **DOWN** to (3, 8) and eat the apple. Take the lead.\n\nDOWN\n**END RATIONALE**",

Let's look at the immediate moves from our current position (3, 8):\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 9):** This is currently our body (the segment we just vacated). If we go UP, we slam into our own body. DEAD. \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):** The board shows `(3, 7)` is empty (`.`). Safe from collision. However, moving DOWN puts us at `(3, 7)`. We need to see if this leads to good opportunities.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):** The board shows `(2, 8)` is empty (`.`). Safe from collision.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):** The board shows `(4, 8)` is part of our body (it's in our `Body` list). Moving RIGHT would crash into ourselves. DEAD. \u274c\n\nSo, the only valid moves are **DOWN** or **LEFT**.\n\n**STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:**\n*   **Enemy Location:** Snake #1 is at `(6, 6)`.\n*   **Score:** We are leading 16-15.\n*   **Apple Hunt:** There is a juicy apple at `(1, 9)`. To get there from `(3, 8)`, we need to move **LEFT** to `(2, 8)`, then **LEFT** to `(1, 8)`, then **UP** to `(1, 9)`. This is a clear path.\n*   **The Trap:** If we move **DOWN** to `(3, 7)`, we are moving away from the apple at `(1, 9)`. We might get stuck in the lower part of the board while the enemy is in the center. We need to dominate the board and control space. Moving **LEFT** towards the top-left corner keeps us in a position to claim that apple and force the enemy to stay away from the top edge.\n\n**DECISION:**\nWe need to close the gap to that apple. Moving **LEFT** gets us one step closer to (1, 9) and keeps us in a safer area away from the enemy's current position. Moving down into the open space at (3, 7) feels like wandering into the middle of nowhere when we have a clear target.\n\nLet's secure the lead by hunting the apple.\n\nLEFT",
