RIGHT is open for now but would swing me toward the board edge and potentially into the tighter corridor formed by my own spine, which makes avoiding future self-collisions harder. LEFT to (6,4) pushes straight toward the apple at (5,4) while staying in a relatively open portion of the board and leaves options to drop down to (6,3) next turn. It\u2019s the most direct route to the nearby apples without cornering myself.\n\nPlan: After moving LEFT to (6,4) and then down toward (6,3)/(5,4), focus on clearing that cluster, and afterward try to loop toward the center-upper region where there\u2019s more open space and still a few apples so I can keep growing without trapping myself.\n\nLEFT",

That leaves only DOWN, even though there\u2019s a risk of a head-on with Snake #0 if it decides to go up; at least moving down keeps me moving and gives me a chance to squeeze past their head once they head south.\n\nLong-term plan: As soon as I pass through (9,5)\u2192(9,4), look for an opening around the southern flank of Snake #0 and then hug the bottom edge toward the apple cluster near (4,0)-(5,2), keeping space between our heads so I\u2019m not forced into another unavoidable collision.\n\nDOWN",
