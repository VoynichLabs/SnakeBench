LEFT: Would take me to (2, 5) - moving toward the apple at (2, 9)\n4. RIGHT: Would take me to (4, 5) - moving away from the closest apples\n\nWait, I notice there's an apple at (7, 5) and the enemy snake is at (7, 6). The enemy snake is right next to that apple! I need to be strategic about which apple to target.\n\nThe apple at (3, 9) is 4 moves away if I go straight up.\nThe apple at (2, 9) would require me to go LEFT then UP, so about 5 moves total.\nThe apple at (6, 8) would require me to go RIGHT then UP, so about 6 moves total.\nThe apple at (9, 0) is very far away.\nThe apple at (7, 5) is closest to the enemy snake.\n\nSince the enemy snake is at (7, 6) and there's an apple at (7, 5), they'll likely move DOWN to grab it. I should focus on securing the apple at (3, 9) by continuing UP, as it's the most direct path and keeps me away from potential conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP toward the apple at (3, 9). After securing that apple, reassess the board and consider whether to go for the apple at (2, 9) or pivot toward other remaining apples based on enemy snake position.\n\nUP"
