It brings us closer to (6, 6) and (7, 6) while avoiding the enemy snake's current path and potential collision.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (1, 7) would lead us closer to the enemy snake, increasing collision risk.

Staying higher gives us better control over the space.\n\n### Strategy Recap\n\n1. **Objective:** Approach (6, 6) or (7, 6) while avoiding the enemy snake's path.\n2. **Safety:** Prioritize vertical movement to maximize control over approach and reduce collision risks.\n3. **Efficiency:** Optimize for moves that maintain a shorter path to apples and create space for safe horizontal movement if necessary.\n\n### Plan for Next Moves\n\n1.

Both are within reach, though (7, 6) is slightly further away from the enemy snake.\n\t- Other apples: (8, 8) is also accessible, but (9, 0) and (8, 1) are on opposite ends of the board and not worth pursuing immediately.\n- **Enemy Snake:** The enemy snake's head is at (5, 5). It's far enough for now to avoid direct confrontation but close enough that I should be cautious about apples near the middle of the board.\n\n#### **Observations:**\n\n1. **Apple Accessibility:** To reach the closest apples, I would need to move down or diagonally toward them. However, the enemy snake could potentially cut me off at (6, 6) or (7, 6). Moving straight down feels risky.\n2. **Current Advantage:** My position on the top row (y = 9) gives me strategic dominance. Dropping down to the row below (y = 8) could jeopardize this if the enemy snake moves up.\n3. **Enemy Movement:** Since the enemy snake's head is at (5, 5), it could potentially move toward the same apples. I need to preemptively secure a fallback position by staying high if needed.\n\n#### **Strategy Recap:**\n\n1. **Avoid Rushing Apples:** Moving directly down to (6, 6) or (7, 6) could risk a collision. The enemy is positioned in a way that creates a potential trap.\n2. **Maintain High Ground:** Stay on the top row for as long as possible. It limits the enemy's options and gives me a safe retreat path.\n3. **Path to Apples:** I can move sideways (toward the right) to extend my path and approach the apples from the side if needed.\n\n### Plan for Next Turn:\n\n- **Objective:** Move right to extend my path while keeping my options open. This gives me a safer approach to the apples while retaining dominance of the top row.\n- **Next Turn Goal:** Start working down toward the apples from a more secure position.\n\n### Next Move:\n\n**Move RIGHT.**\n\n**Strategy for the Next Turn:**\nOnce I reach the right side of the board, evaluate the safest path toward (6, 6) or (7, 6) while monitoring the enemy snake's moves.

I'm perched safely at the top of the board, controlling the top row.\n- **Apples:**\n\t- Closest apples: (6, 6), (7, 6). Both are within reach, though (7, 6) is slightly further away from the enemy snake.\n\t- Other apples: (8, 8) is also accessible, but (9, 0) and (8, 1) are on opposite ends of the board and not worth pursuing immediately.\n- **Enemy Snake:** The enemy snake's head is at (5, 5). It's far enough for now to avoid direct confrontation but close enough that I should be cautious about apples near the middle of the board.\n\n#### **Observations:**\n\n1. **Apple Accessibility:** To reach the closest apples, I would need to move down or diagonally toward them. However, the enemy snake could potentially cut me off at (6, 6) or (7, 6). Moving straight down feels risky.\n2. **Current Advantage:** My position on the top row (y = 9) gives me strategic dominance. Dropping down to the row below (y = 8) could jeopardize this if the enemy snake moves up.\n3. **Enemy Movement:** Since the enemy snake's head is at (5, 5), it could potentially move toward the same apples. I need to preemptively secure a fallback position by staying high if needed.\n\n#### **Strategy Recap:**\n\n1. **Avoid Rushing Apples:** Moving directly down to (6, 6) or (7, 6) could risk a collision. The enemy is positioned in a way that creates a potential trap.\n2. **Maintain High Ground:** Stay on the top row for as long as possible. It limits the enemy's options and gives me a safe retreat path.\n3. **Path to Apples:** I can move sideways (toward the right) to extend my path and approach the apples from the side if needed.\n\n### Plan for Next Turn:\n\n- **Objective:** Move right to extend my path while keeping my options open. This gives me a safer approach to the apples while retaining dominance of the top row.\n- **Next Turn Goal:** Start working down toward the apples from a more secure position.\n\n### Next Move:\n\n**Move RIGHT.**\n\n**Strategy for the Next Turn:**\nOnce I reach the right side of the board, evaluate the safest path toward (6, 6) or (7, 6) while monitoring the enemy snake's moves.

It's far enough for now to avoid direct confrontation but close enough that I should be cautious about apples near the middle of the board.\n\n#### **Observations:**\n\n1. **Apple Accessibility:** To reach the closest apples, I would need to move down or diagonally toward them. However, the enemy snake could potentially cut me off at (6, 6) or (7, 6).

This means moving **DOWN** is off-limits because it would result in self-collision and death.\n- **Wall Proximity:** Moving **RIGHT** to **(9, 8)** would also result in death, as it is out of bounds (the maximum coordinate is 9).\n- **Safe Directions:** The only safe moves are **UP** and **LEFT**.\n\n#### **Apples:**\n\n- **Closest Apples:**\n\t- **(4, 8)** is within reach (if I move **LEFT**, then **LEFT** again, followed by **DOWN** and **RIGHT**).\n\t- **(9, 0)** is at the opposite end of the map, currently too far away to reach without traversing more of the board.\n\n#### **Strategic Considerations:**\n\n- **Avoid Traps:** My focus is on maintaining room to maneuver. I need to avoid backing my snake into corners, which can lead to an increased risk of self-collision or getting stuck.\n- **Future Apple Reach:** Moving **UP** places me closer to the center rows, where I can more easily reach the apple at **(6, 6)** and others near **(7, 6)** and **(4, 8)**.\n- **Enemy Snake:** The enemy snake\u2019s head is at **(9, 2)**, far away from my head at **(8, 8)**. Since the enemy snake has no body and is likely moving downward/rightward in its corner, it poses no immediate threat. I should continue monitoring its movement but not let it dictate my choices for now.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n\n- **Short-term Goal:** Move to **(7, 8)** and then position myself to move closer to **(4, 8)**.\n- **Long-term Strategy:** Begin carving a path to central apples, while keeping a watchful eye on both walls and enemy snake positions.\n\n### Next Move:\n\n**LEFT**.\n\nI\u2019ll move **LEFT**, which keeps me away from walls, allows me to edge closer to the nearby apples, and gives me more room to maneuver safely.\n\n**NEXT MOVE: LEFT.**",

It's far enough for now to avoid direct confrontation but close enough that I should be cautious about apples near the middle of the board.\n\n#### **Observations:**\n\n1. **Apple Accessibility:** To reach the closest apples, I would need to move down or diagonally toward them. However, the enemy snake could potentially cut me off at (6, 6) or (7, 6). Moving straight down feels risky.\n2. **Current Advantage:** My position on the top row (y = 9) gives me strategic dominance. Dropping down to the row below (y = 8) could jeopardize this if the enemy snake moves up.\n3. **Enemy Movement:** Since the enemy snake's head is at (5, 5), it could potentially move toward the same apples. I need to preemptively secure a fallback position by staying high if needed.\n\n#### **Strategy Recap:**\n\n1. **Avoid Rushing Apples:** Moving directly down to (6, 6) or (7, 6) could risk a collision. The enemy is positioned in a way that creates a potential trap.\n2. **Maintain High Ground:** Stay on the top row for as long as possible. It limits the enemy's options and gives me a safe retreat path.\n3. **Path to Apples:** I can move sideways (toward the right) to extend my path and approach the apples from the side if needed.\n\n### Plan for Next Turn:\n\n- **Objective:** Move right to extend my path while keeping my options open. This gives me a safer approach to the apples while retaining dominance of the top row.\n- **Next Turn Goal:** Start working down toward the apples from a more secure position.\n\n### Next Move:\n\n**Move RIGHT.**\n\n**Strategy for the Next Turn:**\nOnce I reach the right side of the board, evaluate the safest path toward (6, 6) or (7, 6) while monitoring the enemy snake's moves. Avoid boxing myself in or prematurely moving into the enemy's range.\n\n**Right.**",

It isn\u2019t an immediate threat, but I should remain cautious and not move directly toward its position.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- **Move to safety:** Avoid corners and walls for the next few turns.
