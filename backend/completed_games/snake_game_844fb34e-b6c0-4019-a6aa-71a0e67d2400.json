However, as per my previously stated strategy, I can't move DOWN because there's a risk of collision with the enemy snake which is at (6,5) with its body at [(7,5), (7,4)]. \n\nConsidering the rest of the board, going RIGHT again to (7,8) would not be beneficial as it moves me away from the nearest apple and it's possible to run into a wall if I'm not careful. Going LEFT, however, brings me closer to the apples at (3,8) and (9,6). After moving LEFT to (5,8), my next moves could be UP, RIGHT, or DOWN depending on the enemy snake's movement, and the distance to the closest apple.\n\nMy primary target is still the apple at (6,5). Chasing for far-off apples could disadvantage me, if the enemy snake is closer to them. Staying closer to the middle of the board while avoiding the enemy snake can offer flexibility for moving towards any apples when they appear.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

          "rationale": "Thinking out loud:\n\nUpdated positions after last move (LEFT):\n- My snake now occupies head at (6,5), body at [(7,5), (7,4)] plus growth due to apple consumption. Thus, new length is now 4, body segments [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4)].\n- Apple originally at (6,5) has been consumed and is now gone.\n- Remaining apples strongly attracting attention: (9,6), (3,8), (0,4), (2,0), (9,3).\n\nImmediate apples worth consideration:\n- Apple at (9,6): To my RIGHT and slightly UP, relatively close.\n- Apple at (3,8): To my LEFT and UP, a bit farther horizontally, similar vertically.\n- Apple at (9,3): Far RIGHT and slightly DOWN.\n- Apple at (0,4): Far LEFT and DOWN.\n- Apple at (2,0): Far LEFT and far DOWN. Least tempting due to distance.\n\nEnemy Analysis:\n- Snake #2 currently at (6,8) heading possibly toward apple at (3,8) or (9,6).  \n- The apple at (9,6) is close enough that I have a good chance to reach it before snake #2. That apple (9,6) might be the safest next target due to positional advantage and less obstacle.\n- Apple at (3,8) is contested and potentially dangerous due to close enemy proximity.\n\nImmediate Move Analysis (Adjacent Moves from (6,5)):\n- LEFT would move to (5,5): clear and safe, but moves away from nearest target apple (9,6).\n- RIGHT would move to (7,5): occupied by own body segment\u2014unsafe.\n- UP would move to (6,6): clear and safe, moves closer vertically to apple at (9,6).\n- DOWN would move to (6,4): clear and safe, but unnecessary move downward away from nearest apples.\n\nStrategic Choice:\n- Clearly, safest and strategically best choice is to go UP toward the apple at (9,6).  \n- Keep eyes open on snake #2's next move carefully; avoid future collision risk as both snakes may converge toward similar areas.\n\nStrategy reminder:\n- Maintain constant awareness of enemy snake positions each turn.\n- Aim for the quickest, safest route to a nearby apple (currently focusing on apple at (9,6)).\n\nDecided next move: UP"
