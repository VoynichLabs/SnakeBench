Let's get tactical early!\n\n**My head:** (1,8)  \n**Enemy head:** (8,8)  \nApples scattered, but we're ignoring apples for now \u2014 we're playing for board control and aggression!  \n\nFirst, check possible moves for immediate death:  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (1,9) \u2014 that's an apple, but more importantly, is it safe? Board shows (1,9) is 'A' (apple), no snake body there. Enemy is at (8,8), so not a direct collision. Safe for now.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1,7) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,8) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,8) \u2014 apple, but also empty. Safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe immediately.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 enemy at (8,8) could move LEFT to (7,8) or DOWN to (8,7) or UP to (8,9) or RIGHT to (9,8).  \nWe need to think about head-on collisions: if we move RIGHT to (2,8) and enemy moves LEFT all the way to (2,8)? Impossible in one turn. So no direct same-cell collision risk this turn.  \n\nLong-term plan:  \nWe want to **box him in** early. Right now we're far apart. But if we move toward center, we can start cutting off his space.  \nAlso, we want to **grow** to have length advantage for head-on collisions later.  \n\nIf we go for apple at (2,8) by moving RIGHT, we grow immediately \u2014 that's good for length advantage.  \nBut moving UP to (1,9) also gets apple and puts us near top wall \u2014 maybe limits future options.  \n\nActually, let's think:  \nUP \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 next turn we'd have body at (1,8), so we can't go back down unless we have other space.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2,8) \u2192 next turn body at (1,8), still central, more open board.  \n\nI like RIGHT \u2014 gets apple, grows to length 2, keeps us more flexible.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (2,8), we'll have length 2. Enemy still length 1. We can try to move toward enemy while avoiding walls, maybe force him into a corner later. Keep options open, don't trap ourselves.  \n\nChat, we're going aggressive early \u2014 let's secure that apple and get longer than him! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa  \n\nRIGHT",

That's suicide! \u274c ELIMINATE.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,8) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n\nSo LEFT is out. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe *right now*.\n\nBut wait \u2014 we gotta think about **simultaneous moves**! Enemy at (7,8) could move LEFT to (6,8), DOWN to (7,7), UP to (7,9), or RIGHT to (8,8).  \nCould he collide with us this turn?  \nIf we go RIGHT to (3,8), enemy would have to move LEFT four spaces to meet us \u2014 impossible.  \nIf we go UP to (2,9) or DOWN to (2,7), enemy can't reach us in one move. So no direct head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:** We have length advantage (2 vs 1). We want to **pressure the enemy** and **cut off his space**!  \nRight now he's on the right side, we're on the left. We could move toward center to control more board.  \nUP gets us an apple and grows to length 3 \u2014 more length advantage for head-on collisions!  \nBut going UP puts us near top wall \u2014 might limit future moves.  \nRIGHT moves us toward center and keeps options open.  \nDOWN moves us away from enemy and into open space \u2014 maybe too passive.\n\nI think **UP** is strong \u2014 secure that apple, grow to 3, then next turn we can start moving toward enemy with more length to threaten.  \nBut let's check follow-up safety:  \nIf we go UP to (2,9), next turn our body will be at [(2,8), (1,8)]. From (2,9) we could go LEFT (1,9) \u2014 apple there, but is it safe? Might be risky if enemy moves that way? We'll assess next turn.  \nWe'll have more options if we go UP now and get longer.\n\nChat, we're playing AGGRESSIVE! Let's get that apple, extend our lead, and then hunt him down! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (2,9), we'll be length 3. Enemy still length 1. Next turn, consider moving LEFT to (1,9) to eat another apple and further grow, OR move toward enemy (RIGHT/DOWN) to start cutting off his escape.

BUT we must think about NEXT TURN collisions.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE BOXING PLAN:** We want to cut off his escape! He's at (8,7). If we go RIGHT to (7,8), we're directly above his possible UP move (8,8). That's good pressure! If we go DOWN to (6,7), we're on his left side but same row \u2014 he might slip right toward the apple at (9,7). We need to stay above him to limit his upward movement and force him toward the bottom edge! Going UP to (6,9) creates distance \u2014 NOT AGGRESSIVE! We have the length advantage, we should be closing the space!\n\n**NEXT TURN SETUP:** If we go RIGHT to (7,8), our body becomes [(6,8), (5,8), (4,8)]. From (7,8), we can go DOWN to (7,7) next turn if he's still at (8,7) or (8,6) \u2014 that's threatening! If he goes RIGHT to (9,7) to eat the apple, he grows to length 3, tying us \u2014 we want to avoid that! So we should move to block his access to apples while keeping our advantage.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** RIGHT to (7,8) \u2014 keeps us close, above him, and ready to drop down for a potential head-on if he moves left/up. We maintain initiative! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Keep him pinned near the bottom-right! Use our length to control the center. If he goes for the apple at (9,7), we can maybe cut him off from returning. Stay aggressive, force him into a corner or a self-crash! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

From there, we could go DOWN to (8,7) \u2014 but that's his old body segment? Wait, after he moves, his tail at (7,7) might still be there unless he grows? He ate an apple last turn, so his tail stays at (7,7) this turn, and next turn his body will be [(9,7) new head?, (8,7), (7,7)]? Actually careful: He moved from (9,7) to either (9,8) or (9,6). His body becomes [new head, (9,7), (8,7)]. So (7,7) becomes empty next turn! So (8,7) will be his body segment next turn. So going DOWN to (8,7) next turn would kill us. So from (8,8), we'd want to go LEFT or UP to stay safe and maintain pressure.\n\nFrom (7,9), we'd have more freedom but less immediate threat.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** RIGHT to (8,8)! Keeps us close, maintains aggressive positioning, and sets up to potentially cut off his vertical movement along the right wall! We force him to dance in that column while we control the space to his left! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Keep him pinned on the right edge! Use the wall as our ally. If he goes down, we follow down; if he goes up, we mirror him. Wait for him to make a desperate move into us or into his own body! Stay patient but aggressive\u2014don't let him slip into the center!\n\nRIGHT",

He'll be at (9,9) with body [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7)]. We're length 3. He'll have the advantage. We need to avoid being pinned against the top wall. Next turn, from (8,9), we can go DOWN (back to (8,8) \u2014 might be empty if he moved), LEFT (to (7,9) \u2014 '.'), or maybe RIGHT? Right would be (9,9) \u2014 his head if he stays? He'll have just eaten, so (9,9) will be his head. So avoid RIGHT. Plan: go LEFT to (7,9) to gain space and maybe loop around to cut him off later. Don't let him use his length to trap us!

HE'S LONGER, SO HEAD-ON COLLISION IS BAD FOR US \u2014 WE DIE, HE SURVIVES! GOTTA PLAY SMART!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DEATH CHECK FROM (8,9):**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,10) \u274c OFF THE BOARD! YIKES, TOP EDGE! ELIMINATE!\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,8) \u2014 BOARD ROW 8: \". . . . . . . T T T\" \u2192 (8,8) is 'T' (enemy body? Wait, enemy body is [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7)] \u2014 (8,8) is NOT listed. But board shows 'T' at (8,8)? Actually looking: row 8 at x=8 is '0' (our old head?), no \u2014 our head now at (8,9). Row 8: \". . . . . . . T T T\" \u2014 positions: x=7 'T', x=8 'T', x=9 'T'. So (8,8) is 'T' \u2014 that's ENEMY BODY! Because enemy ate apple at (9,9), his tail didn't move, so his body is now [(9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7)]? Wait, his head moved to (9,9), so body shifted: new body is [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7)] plus maybe extra? He grew by 1, so length 4: head (9,9), then (9,8), (9,7), (8,7). So (8,8) is NOT his body. But board says 'T' at (8,8)? Could be OUR old body? Our body was [(8,8), (7,8)] last turn. We moved UP to (8,9), so our body shifted: new body is [(8,8), (7,8)]? Actually, when we move, our head goes to new cell, each body segment shifts forward: so new body is [(8,8), (7,8)]? Wait, we didn't eat apple, so length stays 3: head (8,9), then previous head (8,8) becomes neck, then (7,8) becomes tail. So (8,8) is OUR NECK! That's our own body! \u274c MOVING DOWN INTO OUR OWN BODY \u2014 SUICIDE! ELIMINATE DOWN!\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,9) \u2014 BOARD ROW 9: \". A . . . . . . . A\" \u2192 (7,9) is '.' \u2705 SAFE CELL.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,9) \u2014 ENEMY HEAD! \u274c MOVING INTO ENEMY HEAD THIS TURN? That's a head-on collision if he stays still. But he's moving too! If we go RIGHT and he moves LEFT into (8,9), we swap and both die! If he moves DOWN to (9,8), we move into (9,9) as he leaves \u2014 safe! If he moves UP? Can't, off board. If he moves RIGHT? Off board. So enemy's possible moves from (9,9): DOWN to (9,8) (his own neck), LEFT to (8,9) (our head), or maybe STAY? No staying. So RIGHT is risky \u2014 depends on his move. Since he's longer, head-on collision kills us, not him! So AVOID RIGHT unless we're sure he won't go left.\n\n**ENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (9,9):**\n- UP \u2192 (9,10) \u274c OFF BOARD \u2014 NO.\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,8) \u2014 his own body segment (neck) \u274c SUICIDE! He won't do that.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,9) \u2014 our head! If he goes LEFT, he moves into our cell. If we stay still, we die. If we move LEFT to (7,9), he takes (8,9) \u2014 safe for us. If we go RIGHT, we collide.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,9) \u274c OFF BOARD \u2014 NO.\n\nWAIT \u2014 HE CAN'T GO DOWN BECAUSE (9,8) IS HIS NECK? Actually, his body: head (9,9), neck (9,8), then (9,7), then (8,7). So (9,8) is his own body \u2014 moving DOWN is suicide! So his ONLY safe move is LEFT to (8,9)! \ud83d\ude31\n\nCHAT, HE'S FORCED LEFT INTO OUR CELL! THAT MEANS IF WE STAY AT (8,9), WE DIE! WE MUST MOVE AWAY!\n\n**OUR ONLY SAFE MOVE IS LEFT TO (7,9)!** RIGHT IS SUICIDE IF HE GOES LEFT (WHICH HE WILL). DOWN IS SUICIDE INTO OUR NECK. UP IS OFF BOARD. LEFT IS THE ONLY SURVIVAL MOVE!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** We're at (7,9) next turn, enemy at (8,9). He's length 4, we're length 3. He's chasing us! We need to loop around \u2014 maybe go DOWN to (7,8) if safe, or LEFT to (6,9). We must avoid being trapped in top-left corner. Look for apples to catch up in length! If we can get to length 4, we can fight head-on. For now, evade and look for opportunities to cut him off or force him into his own body. Watch board edges!\n\nLEFT",
