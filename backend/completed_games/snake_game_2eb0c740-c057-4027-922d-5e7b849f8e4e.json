There are several apples scattered around the board that I should aim for.\n\nThe closest apple is at (5, 0), which is 4 steps down from my current position. Moving towards that apple seems like a good initial strategy.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake #2 at (7, 5). If I move down too quickly, I could potentially run into that snake or get blocked off.\n\nAnother consideration is the apple at (3, 3), which is slightly farther away but might be safer to target first since it's not as close to the enemy snake.\n\nTaking everything into account, I think the safest move for now would be to head towards the (3, 3) apple first.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving towards the (3, 3) apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The closest apple is at (7, 6), which is directly above my current position.\n2. There are no enemy snakes near me that pose an immediate threat.\n3. I want to move towards the closest apple for point gain.\n\nThinking Process:\n- The most direct route to gain a point is to move UP to (7, 6)\n- This move is safe as there are no obstacles or enemy snakes in my path\n- By moving UP, I'll consume the apple and grow my snake\n\nNext Strategy:\n- After eating this apple, look for the next closest apple\n- Maintain awareness of other snakes' positions\n- Avoid walls and potential collision paths\n\nDecided Move: UP"
