It is not on the edge, so it retains flexibility.\n- DOWN to (4,0) could also reach the apple next turn (then LEFT), but puts me on the bottom edge (fewer immediate escapes).

This is strategically better for maintaining mobility. \u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713\n\n**Best move:**\n**RIGHT** to (1, 3) is optimal because:\n1. It's completely safe (no collision risk)\n2. It moves me toward the center of the board, giving me more mobility options\n3. It positions me better to access multiple apples (5, 6), (8, 6), and (2, 8)\n4. Continuing DOWN to (0, 2) risks getting trapped in the bottom-left corner with limited escape routes\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (1, 3), I should continue working my way toward the center-right portion of the board to maintain mobility. From (1, 3), I can consider:\n- Moving UP toward (2, 8) or RIGHT toward (5, 6)\n- I need to avoid getting boxed in by my own growing body\n- The enemy snake is at (5, 1) and likely heading toward (9, 2) or (8, 6), so our paths shouldn't cross immediately\n- I should keep building my length advantage while maintaining escape routes\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy has a 2-apple lead, so I need to collect apples quickly. I'm well-positioned on the left side to reach apples (1, 8) and (2, 8). Apple (0, 4) is also very close and could be a quick collect.\n\n**Move evaluation:**\n- **UP** to (1, 4): Good progress toward apples (1, 8), (2, 8), and (0, 4)\n- **LEFT** to (0, 3): Moves toward apple (0, 4) and keeps left edge option\n- **RIGHT** to (2, 3): Moves toward center but away from immediate target apples\n\n**Head-on collision check:**\nEnemy at (8, 9) can move to: (8, 8) [into own body - suicide], (7, 9), (9, 9), or (8, can't go up - off board). None of these will reach my potential moves (1, 4), (0, 3), or (2, 3), so no collision risk.\n\n**Best move:**\n**UP** to (1, 4) - Continues my upward progression toward the closest apples (1, 8) and (2, 8). This maintains my strategic positioning on the left side and keeps multiple safe options open for next turn.\n\n**Future plan:** Continue moving UP along the left side to reach apples (1, 8) and/or (2, 8). After collecting those, assess whether to pursue remaining apples or avoid the enemy snake which may be moving toward the top-left area.\n\nUP",

Enemy #1 is at (0,8) and can contest (1,8) next turn, but cannot reach (2,8) this turn. Taking the apple increases our lead and keeps options open.\n- UP or DOWN are safe but give up the immediate nearby apple and allow the opponent a better chance to take (1,8).\n- No immediate collisions or body hits if we move LEFT. We avoid moving into our own neck (RIGHT).\n\nShort plan:\n- Take LEFT to eat (2,8). Next turn reassess: if (1,8) is uncontested, take it; if enemy contests (1,8) or moves aggressively, avoid head-on by routing down toward the center and then toward (5,5) to collect that apple and stay flexible.\n\nLEFT",

Down from (5, 9) appears to be safe (row 8, position 5 shows \".\"), which would start my descent toward the apples at (5, 5) and (5, 4).
