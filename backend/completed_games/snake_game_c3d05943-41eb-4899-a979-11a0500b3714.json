Moving UP (to 6,8) will allow me to move to (5,8), (4,8), etc., to grab apples. Moving RIGHT (to 8,9) will also allow for future moves. Moving down would put me on a potential apple at (8, 9).\n\nThe most promising move would be to continue moving towards either (8, 9) or (6,8). I want to create future options.

This isn't a valid move since I'm already on an apple.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moves to (8, 9).  This is a valid move and puts me on an apple!  \n\nSince I have the option of moving to the apple at (8, 9) with both UP and RIGHT,  and the RIGHT move also allows further exploration, I choose LEFT because it's a valid move I'm not considering. I'll evaluate this later. I want to make a move that is both safe and provides flexibility.
