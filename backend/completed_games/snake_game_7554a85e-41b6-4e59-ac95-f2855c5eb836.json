Moving UP to (5, 6) would collide with the snake's body.\n\nThe apples are at (9, 8), (3, 2), (9, 3), (6, 1), and (4, 9).\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance from the current head position (5, 5) to each apple:\n- To (9, 8): |5-9| + |5-8| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (3, 2): |5-3| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- To (9, 3): |5-9| + |5-3| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- To (6, 1): |5-6| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (4, 9): |5-4| + |5-9| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nThe closest apples are at (3, 2), (6, 1), and (4, 9), all at a distance of 5.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves by calculating the distance to the closest apples from the resulting positions:\n- Move DOWN to (5, 4):\n    - Distance to (3, 2): |5-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n    - Distance to (6, 1): |5-6| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n    - Distance to (4, 9): |5-4| + |4-9| = 1 + 5 = 6\n    After moving DOWN, the closest apples are (3, 2) and (6, 1) at distance 4.\n\n- Move LEFT to (4, 5):\n    - Distance to (3, 2): |4-3| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n    - Distance to (6, 1): |4-6| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6\n    - Distance to (4, 9): |4-4| + |5-9| = 0 + 4 = 4\n    After moving LEFT, the closest apples are (3, 2) and (4, 9) at distance 4.\n\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 5):\n    - Distance to (3, 2): |6-3| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n    - Distance to (6, 1): |6-6| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4\n    - Distance to (4, 9): |6-4| + |5-9| = 2 + 4 = 6\n    After moving RIGHT, the closest apple is (6, 1) at distance 4.\n\nMoving DOWN or LEFT results in a position where the closest apple is distance 4, improving the situation compared to staying put (distance 5). Moving RIGHT also gets to distance 4, but only targets one of the original closest apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 5) positions the snake well to proceed towards (3, 2) or (4, 9). Moving DOWN to (5, 4) positions the snake well to proceed towards (3, 2) or (6, 1). Both seem like valid options.\n\nLet's choose to move LEFT, heading towards the left side of the board which contains two of the currently closest apples ((3,2) and (4,9) are both closer from (4,5) than (6,1)).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT to (4, 5), the head will be at (4, 5) and the body will be [(5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)]. I will then evaluate the safe moves from (4, 5) and choose one that leads towards the closest remaining apple.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n- Our snake's head is at (9,0).\n- Our last move was LEFT, so previous position was at (10,0), but on a 10x10 grid, the x-values go from 0 to 9. The head is at (9,0), and our body is at (6,0).\n- Our initial move was LEFT, aiming toward the apple at (5,0), which is one step to the left.\n\nPositions:\n\n- Head at (9,0)\n- Body at (6,0) (which suggests we've been moving along y=0 from right to left)\n- The apple at (5,0), directly to the left along y=0.\n- No immediate threats on this row; the enemy snake at (5,6) is far above.\n\nPotential concerns:\n\n- Moving directly left to (8,0), then (7,0), then (6,0), then (5,0), is straightforward.\n- Since our body occupies (6,0), moving into (6,0) would cause us to collide \u2014 so our planned path should avoid moving into occupied body cells.\n- To reach (5,0), the sequence of moves is: LEFT (from (9,0) to (8,0)), LEFT (to (7,0)), LEFT (to (6,0))\u2014but (6,0) is our body's position, so that move is dangerous.\n- Wait, if our body is at (6,0), moving into (6,0) would cause a collision; we need to avoid that.\n\nI notice a discrepancy: earlier, the position states:\n\n> Your snake ID: 1 which is currently positioned at (0,0) with body at [(1,0)]\n\nand in the last move info, the direction was LEFT, and the head was presumably at (9,0). Combining this:\n\n- Our head was at (9,0), last move was LEFT.\n- Our body is at (6,0), and the head is at (9,0)?\n\nThis indicates that the snake has grown or that positions are not fully consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\n- The snake's body following (1,0), with the head at (9,0), indicates the snake is elongated along the bottom row, from (1,0) to (9,0).\n\nBut the last move was LEFT, moving from (10,0) to (9,0)? Our grid max x is 9, so (10,0) is outside the grid.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the core idea is:\n\n- Our snake's head is at (9,0).\n- Last move was LEFT, so previous position was at (10,0), which is outside the grid, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last move was to the LEFT, and the current head is at (9,0).\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT from (9,0) to (8,0) is safe; the body is behind at (6,0), so moving into (8,0), (7,0), then (6,0) should be safe.\n\nLooking at the plan, we can:\n\n- Move LEFT from (9,0) to (8,0).\n- Next turn, move LEFT to (7,0).\n- Next, move LEFT to (6,0), which is occupied by the body, so that would cause collision.\n\nAlternatively, to reach the apple at (5,0):\n\n- From (9,0), move LEFT to (8,0).\n- From (8,0), LEFT to (7,0).\n- From (7,0), LEFT to (6,0): dangerous, as (6,0) is our body's position.\n- Or, from (7,0), LEFT to (6,0) (dangerous), so maybe better to go around.\n\nAlternatively, move UP first to avoid collision and approach the apple from above.\n\nBut:\n\n- The apple is on (5,0), directly left of the head.\n- Moving UP or DOWN would be longer.\n\nNext, is the path to the apple safe if we go:\n\n- From (9,0), move LEFT to (8,0).\n- Then LEFT to (7,0).\n- Then LEFT to (6,0), but this would collide with the body at (6,0), so avoid that.\n\nTherefore, moving UP or DOWN to approach the apple might be safer.\n\nAre there any obstacles above?\n\n- The row at y=1 has apples at (4,1), (6,1), (2,1), etc., but no dangerous obstacles present.\n\n- The enemy at (5,6) is distant.\n\n- Moving UP from (9,0) to (9,1): safe as per the map, as no hazards.\n\n- Then, moving LEFT along row y=1 toward x=5 or x=4 would be possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP then LEFT avoids the body at (6,0)?\n\nYes.\n\nGiven the clarity, the safest move to approach the apple at (5,0):\n\n- Move UP from (9,0) to (9,1): safe.\n\n- Then from (9,1) move LEFT along y=1 toward (5,1).\n\n- Wait, no apples along y=1, but the apple at (4,9) is far away.\n\n- Alternatively, avoid unnecessary detours.\n\nBut perhaps moving UP is unnecessary if the straight path along y=0 is clear.\n\nFrom the previous info, moving LEFT seems safe if we go step by step:\n\n- Move LEFT to (8,0): safe.\n\n- Next turn, move LEFT to (7,0): safe.\n\n- Then, move LEFT to (6,0): occupied by body, so collision.\n\nSo, the best move right now:\n\n- Moving LEFT one step from (9,0) to (8,0) is safe.\n\nNext move plan: after that, we can plan to move further left or go around the obstacles to reach the apple.\n\nConcluding:\n\n- Moving LEFT now helps us progress toward the apple at (5,0).\n\n-It's the most direct route, and with no obstacles in the immediate path, this is an optimal choice.\n\nTherefore, the next move: **LEFT**\n\n**Decided move: LEFT**"
