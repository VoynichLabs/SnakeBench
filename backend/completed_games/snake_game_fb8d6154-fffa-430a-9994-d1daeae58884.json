Prioritize eating the closest apples to gain points.\n2. Avoid getting too close to the enemy snake or trapping myself.\n3. Try to maintain a central position on the board for better maneuverability.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

I don't want to risk running into the other snake or the wall. I'll try to position myself to get a good shot at an apple on the next turn.\n\nI'm thinking of moving... RIGHT. This will bring me closer to the apple at (3, 9) and give me a good chance to grab it on the next turn."
