          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's start by understanding the current situation. The user is controlling snake ID 1, which is at position (3,4). The head is there, and the body is none, so it's a single-segment snake. The apples are at (4,3), (4,0), (9,3), (4,7), (4,4). The enemy snake #0 is at (9,9) with no body. The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nThe last move was RIGHT. So, from (3,4), moving right would take the head to (4,4). Wait, but (4,4) has an apple! So if the previous move was RIGHT, the snake would have moved from (3,4) to (4,4), collecting that apple. That makes sense because in the last move rationale, they chose RIGHT. So after that move, the snake would have grown by one segment? Or maybe the snake collected the apple at (4,4) and grew. But the current position of the snake is still head at (3,4), but wait, no. The last move was RIGHT, so after that move, the head would have moved to (4,4). So the current state after that move would be head at (4,4), but the user's snake now has a body? Or maybe the snake grew after the move.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\" So when the snake's head moves into an apple, it grows. So in the last move, moving RIGHT from (3,4) to (4,4) would collect the apple there. So the snake would now have a body. The body would be the previous head position (3,4), right? Because when you move, the head moves forward, and the tail (which was none before) would not exist. Wait, if the snake was previously just the head at (3,4), and moves right to (4,4), then after the move, the head is at (4,4), and the body is the previous head's position. So the snake's body would be [(3,4)], making it two segments now. But in the current state description, the user's snake has \"Body: none\" and apples collected 0. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the last move hasn't been processed yet. Because the current state is after the last move. Wait, the user's snake's current position is still head at (3,4), but according to the last move being RIGHT, that would have moved the head to (4,4). So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the current state is after the last move. So the last move was RIGHT, which would have moved the head from (3,4) to (4,4). But in the current state, the head is still (3,4). That suggests that maybe the last move hasn't been applied yet. Or perhaps the current state is the state before the next move. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe current snake's position is:\n\nYour snake (ID 1):\n  - Head: (3,4)\n  - Body: none\n  - Apples collected: 0\n\nSo the last move was RIGHT, but the head is still at (3,4). That suggests that maybe the last move hasn't been applied. Or perhaps the previous move was RIGHT, but the snake didn't collect any apple? Wait, but (4,4) is an apple. So moving into that should collect it. Unless the last move was not processed. Wait, maybe the last move information is what the snake just did. So the last move was RIGHT, so the snake moved from (3,4) to (4,4), collected the apple at (4,4), and now the head is at (4,4), with a body segment at (3,4). But according to the current state, the head is at (3,4). That's conflicting. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the timeline.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last move was RIGHT, but the apple at (4,4) was not collected. That doesn't make sense. Unless the snake didn't move into the apple. Wait, perhaps the user's snake was at (3,4), moved right to (4,4), which is an apple. So after the move, the snake's head is at (4,4), and the body is at (3,4). So the current state should have the head at (4,4), but the problem states the head is at (3,4). That's a contradiction. Hmm. Maybe the last move is the move that the snake just made, so the current position is after that move. Therefore, the head should be at (4,4) now. But according to the problem description, the head is at (3,4). That's confusing. Maybe there's a typo in the problem. Or perhaps the last move wasn't applied yet. Alternatively, maybe the last move was RIGHT, but the snake is now at (4,4), but the problem's current state is given as (3,4). That's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is presenting the current state before the next move. So the last move was RIGHT, which moved the head to (4,4), but in the current state, the user's snake's head is at (3,4). That doesn't add up. Unless the last move was not applied. Maybe the problem is presenting the state before the next move. So the last move was RIGHT, which the snake made, and now the next move is to be decided. So the current head is at (4,4), but the problem says (3,4). That's conflicting. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last move was RIGHT, but the snake didn't collect the apple. Wait, but (4,4) is an apple. So moving into it would collect it. So the snake would have grown. But according to the current state, apples collected is 0. That suggests that the snake hasn't collected any apples yet. So maybe the last move was RIGHT but the snake didn't move into an apple. But (3,4) moving right is (4,4), which is an apple. So that's a contradiction. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's current state. But since I have to work with the given information, I'll proceed. The current position is head at (3,4), body none, apples 0. The last move was RIGHT, but perhaps that move didn't result in collecting an apple. Maybe the apple at (4,4) was not collected. That could happen if the snake moved into it but didn't grow. But according to the rules, moving into an apple makes you grow. So this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the last move was RIGHT, but the snake's head is now at (4,4), but the problem's current state is presented as (3,4). That's a problem. But perhaps the problem's current state is correct, and the last move was RIGHT but the snake is still at (3,4). That would mean that the move didn't happen. But that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the last move was a RIGHT, but the snake is still at (3,4) because the move was invalid. But the problem says that the last move was RIGHT, so it must have been a valid move. \n\nThis is a bit of a puzzle. But perhaps I should proceed with the given current state. The head is at (3,4), body none, apples 0. The last move was RIGHT. So perhaps the snake moved right from (3,4) to (4,4), but for some reason, the apple wasn't collected. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (4,4) was collected in the last move, so the snake's body is now at (3,4), and the head is at (4,4). But the problem's current state says the head is at (3,4). That's conflicting. \n\nHmm. This is a critical point. If the last move was RIGHT, the head should be at (4,4). But according to the problem, the head is at (3,4). So perhaps the problem's data is incorrect, but I have to work with what's given. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the last move was RIGHT, but the snake is now at (3,4) because the move was invalid. But that would mean the snake died, but the current state shows it's alive. \n\nThis is a problem. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the current state is as given. The head is at (3,4), body none, apples 0. The last move was RIGHT, but perhaps the snake didn't move. That's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's current state is before the last move. But the user's last move information shows that the last move was RIGHT. \n\nThis is a bit of a confusion. But perhaps I should proceed with the given current state. The head is at (3,4), and the next move is to be decided. \n\nThe apples are at (4,3), (4,0), (9,3), (4,7), (4,4). So (4,4) is an apple. The enemy is at (9,9). \n\nThe user's snake is at (3,4). The goal is to collect apples and not die. \n\nThe possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider each move direction. \n\nFirst, check which moves are safe. \n\nCurrent head is (3,4). \n\nPossible moves:\n\nUP: (3,5). Check if that's on the board. Yes. Then check if that cell is part of any snake's body. The enemy snake's head is at (9,9), body none. So moving to (3,5) is safe. \n\nDOWN: (3,3). Also on the board. Check if that's an apple. (3,3) is not in the apple list. So safe. \n\nLEFT: (2,4). On the board, not an apple. Safe. \n\nRIGHT: (4,4). Which is an apple. So moving there would collect it. But need to check if that cell is safe. \n\nSo all four directions are possible. \n\nNow, check for immediate death. \n\nFor each direction:\n\nUP: (3,5). Not in any snake's body. Safe. \n\nDOWN: (3,3). Safe. \n\nLEFT: (2,4). Safe. \n\nRIGHT: (4,4). Which is an apple. So moving there would collect it. But is (4,4) safe? The enemy snake is at (9,9), so no. So (4,4) is safe. \n\nSo all four directions are safe. \n\nNow, the next step is to choose a move that allows future moves and helps collect apples. \n\nLooking at the apples: (4,3), (4,0), (9,3), (4,7), (4,4). \n\nThe apple at (4,4) is directly to the right. So moving RIGHT would collect it. That's good. But after that, the snake would have a body at (3,4). So the next move can't go back to (3,4) because that's the body. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to get the apple. Then, the next move could be to go up, down, left, or right again. \n\nBut if we move RIGHT now, we get the apple. That's a good move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe other apples are better. For example, (4,3) is down from (4,4). So if we move right to (4,4), then down to (4,3) next. But that would require two moves. \n\nBut since each turn is simultaneous, the enemy is moving. The enemy is at (9,9), which is far away. But we need to consider if the enemy's next move could interfere. \n\nBut the enemy's movement is not known. The problem doesn't give information about the enemy's next move. So we can't predict that. \n\nSo the immediate priority is to collect the apple at (4,4) if possible. \n\nBut wait, the last move was RIGHT. If the last move was RIGHT, then the snake is now at (4,4). But according to the current state, the head is at (3,4). That's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the last move was RIGHT, but the snake is still at (3,4). That would mean that the move was invalid. But that's not possible. \n\nThis is a critical issue. If the last move was RIGHT, the head should be at (4,4). But the current state says (3,4). So perhaps the problem's data is wrong. But since I have to work with the given data, I'll proceed. \n\nAssuming that the current head is at (3,4), and the last move was RIGHT. Maybe the previous move was RIGHT, but the snake is now at (3,4). That's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the last move was RIGHT, but the snake's head is now at (4,4), and the problem's current state is presented incorrectly. But I have to go with the given data. \n\nIn any case, the current head is at (3,4). The apples near are (4,4) (right), (4,3) (down from (4,4)), but (3,4) is the current position. \n\nSo moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), which is an apple. That's a good move. \n\nBut after that, the snake's body would be at (3,4). So the next move can't go back to (3,4). \n\nBut if we move RIGHT now, we collect the apple. That's a good choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down to (3,3) or left to (2,4) could be safer. But the apple at (4,4) is directly ahead. \n\nBut the problem says that when moving into an apple, you grow. So collecting that apple would increase the snake's length, which is beneficial. \n\nSo the best move is to go RIGHT to collect the apple at (4,4). \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the last move was RIGHT. So if the current head is at (3,4), then the last move was RIGHT, which would have moved the head to (4,4). But the current state says the head is at (3,4). That's a contradiction. \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the last move was not applied. But the problem says that the last move information is RIGHT. \n\nThis is a problem. But perhaps the current state is after the last move. So the head is at (4,4), but the problem's data is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the last move was RIGHT, but the snake is now at (4,4). So the current head is (4,4). But the problem says (3,4). \n\nThis is a critical error. But since I have to proceed, I'll assume that the current head is (3,4), and the last move was RIGHT. \n\nIn that case, moving RIGHT again would take the head to (4,4), which is an apple. So that's a good move. \n\nSo the answer would be RIGHT. \n\nBut I need to check for possible collisions. \n\nAfter moving RIGHT, the head is at (4,4). The body is none. So the new body would be the previous head position (3,4). \n\nBut in the current state, the body is none. So after moving, the body would be (3,4). \n\nSo the next move can't go back to (3,4). \n\nBut for the current move, moving RIGHT is safe. \n\nSo the correct move is RIGHT. \n\nBut maybe there's a reason to choose another direction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (4,4) is not the best to collect. For example, if moving right would lead to a dead end. \n\nBut in this case, after collecting (4,4), the snake can move up, down, or right again. \n\nAlternatively, if the snake is at (3,4), moving RIGHT to (4,4) is the best option. \n\nSo the final answer should be RIGHT.\nRIGHT",
