No walls, no body, no enemy.\n2. **DOWN** - (4, 4): Safe. No walls, no body, no enemy.\n3. **LEFT** - (3, 5): Safe. No walls, no body, no enemy.\n4. **RIGHT** - (5, 5): Safe. No walls, no body, no enemy.\n\nAll moves are safe since I'm just a head with no body to collide with, and the enemy is far away at (7, 0).\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n\nLet me evaluate distance to nearest apples from each safe position:\n- UP (4, 6): Distance to (3, 6) = 1 step. Very close!\n- DOWN (4, 4): Distance to (1, 4) = 3 steps\n- LEFT (3, 5): Distance to (3, 6) = 1 step\n- RIGHT (5, 5): Distance to (7, 7) = 3+ steps\n\n**Strategic Reasoning:**\n\nMoving UP to (4, 6) gets me adjacent to the apple at (3, 6), which I can grab next turn by moving LEFT. This is an efficient path to my first apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3, 5) also positions me adjacent to (3, 6), but uses an extra move to get there horizontally first.\n\nUP is the most direct path toward the apple at (3, 6). Once I eat it, I'll have momentum moving through the upper-left portion of the board where multiple apples are clustered.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (3, 6), continue exploring the upper-left quadrant where apples at (1, 4) and (0, 1) are located. The enemy at (7, 0) is currently distant but will move; monitor for potential collisions. Focus on steady apple collection while maintaining board awareness.\n\nUP",

Even if it moves toward me, it's still 4+ cells away (Manhattan distance from (5, 1) to my new position (1, 4) would be 8 cells).
