All directions are safe from off-board.\n- **Self-collision**: Since your snake has no body, moving in any direction won\u2019t collide with itself.\n- **Enemy collision**: The enemy is at (9,2). Moving left from (7,2) would go to (6,2), which is safe. Moving right would go to (8,2), which is also safe. Moving up/down would go to (6,2) or (8,2), but the enemy is at (9,2), so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### **Apple Proximity and Strategy**\n- The closest apple is at (6,2). Moving left from (7,2) would take you to (6,2), directly onto the apple.\n- The other apples are farther away, and moving toward (6,2) is the most efficient immediate gain.\n\n### **Future Considerations**\n- If you move left to (6,2), you\u2019ll eat the apple there and grow by one segment. Your new body will be at (7,2) (since you\u2019re moving left, the tail will shift right).\n- The enemy is at (9,2), so if you move left, you\u2019ll be at (6,2) and the enemy will be at (9,2). No immediate collision risk, but the enemy could move toward you in future turns.\n- Moving right to (8,2) would not eat an apple, and you\u2019d be farther from the closest apple.\n\n### **Long-Term Plan**\n- **Short-term**: Eat the apple at (6,2) immediately to grow and gain points.\n- **Mid-term**: Monitor enemy movement and avoid direct paths where they might collide.\n- **Long-term**: Expand toward apples (3,6) and (5,5) while keeping the enemy at bay.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe best immediate move is to **LEFT**, as it directly targets the closest apple and grows the snake safely.\n\nLEFT",

This is a **backwards collision** (death).\n   - **LEFT:** (5,2) \u2192 Valid (no collision).\n   - **RIGHT:** (7,2) \u2192 Valid (tail is at (7,2), but moving right would place head at (7,2), which is your tail\u2019s position. **Backwards collision (death).**\n\n**Eliminated Moves:**\n- DOWN and RIGHT are invalid due to backwards collision.\n\n**Remaining Safe Moves:**\n- UP and LEFT.\n\n**Apple Proximity & Strategy:**\n- The closest *new* apple is (6,6), which is 4 steps away (e.g., UP twice, LEFT twice).\n- Moving UP to (5,2) is a dead-end (no apples nearby, and the enemy is far away). This move does not grow the snake and risks losing future options.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,2) is also a dead-end (same reasoning as UP).\n- However, the apple at (6,2) is occupied by your tail, but the snake can grow by moving into it (since the tail is already there). This is a **safe growth move** (no collision, no off-board).\n\n**Revised Decision:**\n- The snake can grow by moving LEFT to (5,2), but this does not target any new apple. The best immediate action is to **avoid dead-ends** and prioritize future apple reachability.\n- The only viable move that keeps the snake alive and grows it is moving LEFT to (6,2), but this is already occupied by the tail. The snake can grow by moving into it, but this is not optimal for long-term growth.\n\n**Correction:**\nThe snake can grow by moving into the tail\u2019s position (6,2) if the tail is at (7,2). However, this is not a forward move toward new apples. The correct approach is to **avoid immediate growth moves** unless they are necessary.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe best move is to **UP** to (5,2), which keeps the snake alive and avoids immediate growth moves that may trap it. This also opens up future paths toward the apple at (6,6).\n\nUP",

No immediate threat.\n\n4. **Safe Moves from (5, 3):**\n   - **UP:** (4, 3) \u2192 Safe (no collision).\n   - **DOWN:** (6, 3) \u2192 Collides with tail at (6, 2) if we consider the snake\u2019s body. Wait, no: the tail is at (6, 2), so moving down to (6, 3) is safe unless it overlaps with the tail. Actually, the tail is at (6, 2), so moving down to (6, 3) is safe (no overlap with tail).\n   - **LEFT:** (4, 3) \u2192 Same as UP.\n   - **RIGHT:** (6, 3) \u2192 Same as DOWN.\n\n   **Correction:** The tail is at (6, 2), so moving down to (6, 3) is safe (no collision with tail). Moving backwards would be (5, 2), which is not an option here.\n\n5. **Apple Proximity & Strategy:**\n   - Moving **DOWN to (6, 3)** is the most direct path toward the apple at (6, 6). This would place the head closer to the apple in the next two moves.\n   - Moving **UP or LEFT** would keep the snake in a safer position but may delay reaching the apple.\n\n6. **Enemy Threat:** Snake #0 is far away, so no immediate danger.\n\n### Immediate Decision:\nMoving **DOWN to (6, 3)** is the safest and most efficient move to progress toward the apple at (6, 6).\n\nDOWN",

Apples at (6,6), (3,6), (5,5), (1,4), (8,7).\n- Legal moves this turn: UP to (9,5), DOWN to (9,3), LEFT to (8,4). RIGHT is off-board.\n- All three moves are safe this turn (no collision with walls or bodies).\n- Distance to the nearest appealing apples improves most by moving LEFT: from (9,4) to (8,4) reduces Manhattan distance to (8,7) to 3, and keeps future options open toward (6,6) and (5,5) without rushing toward the enemy.\n- Moving UP also reduces distance similarly but positions you further to the right column, which may limit quick access to left-side apples.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move LEFT now to begin aligning with the central apple cluster, especially aiming for (8,7). If the enemy chases toward (6,4) or heads elsewhere, maintain flexible paths to multiple apples and avoid getting boxed in.\n\nMove:\nLEFT",
