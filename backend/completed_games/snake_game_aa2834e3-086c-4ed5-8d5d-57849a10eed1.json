I need to move in one of the four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nThere are five apples on the board: at (7,8), (2,9), (2,7), (8,1), and (0,4). The closest apples are (7,8) and (8,1), both with a Manhattan distance of 4 from my current position. Apple (7,8) is in the same row, just to the right (higher x-column). Apple (8,1) is in a row above and to the left.\n\nThe enemy snake, ID 0, is at (9,7), which is farther away (Manhattan distance |9-7| + |7-4| = 2 + 3 = 5). Since the enemy only has a head shown, there might be a risk of collision if it moves, but I'll prioritize growth and safety for now.\n\nThe adjacent cells to my head are (7,3), (7,5), (8,4), and (6,4). None of these are specified in the board state or my position to have any obstacles or apples. From the board display, I can infer that (7,4) is occupied by my head, so I cannot move there, but the adjacent cells are likely empty unless otherwise marked. However, the board display is inconsistent or possibly truncated, as (7,4) is not shown as '1' in the given state, but I'll rely on the initial description.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn should be to move towards an apple to gain points and grow. Apple (7,8) is at the same row with a higher x-coordinate, so moving RIGHT would bring me closer directly. This avoids unnecessary changes in row and focuses on increasing my score. If I reach (7,8), I can eat the apple and grow. I should also avoid the enemy but, given the distance, it's not immediate.\n\nSince no immediate threats are present, I'll choose to move towards the closest apple in terms of x-direction since it's in the same row. Moving RIGHT is the first step towards (7,8).\n\nFinal decision: Move RIGHT.",

          "rationale": "The game is in its early stages with both snakes having a length of 1 (only a head). The goal is to secure the closest apple while remaining safe.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Apple Targets:**\n    *   Apple at (7, 8): My distance is 3 moves (e.g., UP, LEFT, LEFT). Enemy distance (from 7, 4) is 4 moves. I am closer.\n    *   Apple at (8, 1): My distance is far. Enemy distance is 4 moves.\n    *   Other apples are further away.\n\n2.  **My Options:**\n    *   **UP to (9, 8):** This creates a path to the apple via the top row (row 8). The path would be (9, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (7, 8). This path stays at y=8.\n    *   **LEFT to (8, 7):** This creates a path via (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 8). This path enters the column x=7 at row 7.\n\n3.  **Enemy Movements:**\n    *   The enemy is at (7, 4). If they target the same apple at (7, 8), they will likely move UP through (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7).\n    *   If I take the **LEFT** path, I arrive at (7, 7) on turn 2. The enemy, if moving straight up, arrives at (7, 6) on turn 2. On turn 3, I move to (7, 8) eating the apple, while the enemy moves to (7, 7) potentially hitting my newly extended tail. While this is a strong defensive play (blocking), it puts me in close proximity to the enemy.\n    *   If I take the **UP** path (High route), I stay in column 8 and 9 until I grab the apple. I move (9, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (7, 8). At turn 3, I secure the apple. The enemy, being slower, will only be at (7, 7) by then. This path avoids any risk of collision or guessing games in the middle of the board.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI will take the high route (UP) to secure the apple at (7, 8). This path is the same speed (3 moves) but keeps me further away from the enemy, minimizing the chance of being cut off or colliding in column 7. It also positions me well near the top edge to pursue the next apple at (2, 9).\n\n**Next Move Pick:**\nUP\n\n**Rationale:**\nI am closer to the apple at (7, 8) than the enemy. Moving UP places me on a safe trajectory (y=8) to claim the apple without entering the column (x=7) where the enemy is advancing until the final moment. This avoids collision risks.\n\nUP",

My closest target is the apple at (7, 8).\n    *   **Enemy Snake (Head at 8, 4):** The enemy is in the mid-right area. They have just moved to (8, 4), likely positioning themselves for the apple at (8, 1) or trying to intercept, but they are too far to beat me to the top apple.\n    *   **Target (7, 8):** I am 2 moves away (LEFT, LEFT). The enemy is at least 5 moves away.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT to (8, 8):** This is the direct path to the apple at (7, 8). It keeps me safe and secures the point quickly. The enemy is at (8, 4) and can only reach (8, 5) next turn, so there is no risk of collision at (8, 8).\n    *   **UP to (9, 9):** This moves to the corner. While safe, it lengthens the path to the apple to 3 moves (LEFT, DOWN) or forces a detour. It's less efficient.\n    *   **DOWN to (9, 7):** Moves away from the target.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Hits the wall (x=10 boundary).\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   Move **LEFT** to (8, 8) immediately.\n    *   Next turn, move **LEFT** again to (7, 8) to eat the apple.\n    *   After consuming the apple, I will likely head towards the left side of the board (apples at 2, 9 and 2, 7) while the enemy is occupied in the bottom right with the apple at (8, 1).\n\n**Rationale:**\nI am closest to the apple at (7, 8) by a significant margin (2 moves vs enemy's 5+). Moving LEFT puts me directly on the path to consume it on the following turn. The enemy is too far away to pose a collision threat at (8, 8).

The goal is to eat an apple to grow and gain points, while avoiding walls, enemy snakes, or my own body.\n\nThere are five apples on the board: at (7,8), (2,9), (2,7), (8,1), and (0,4). Let's calculate Manhattan distances from my head position (8,4):\n- (7,8): |7-8| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- (2,9): |2-8| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n- (2,7): |2-8| + |7-4| = 6 + 3 = 9\n- (8,1): |8-8| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- (0,4): |0-8| + |4-4| = 8 + 0 = 8\n\nThe closest apple is (8,1) with a distance of 3. Jha, since no other apples are closer, I should move directly toward it to save moves and points. (8,1) has the same x-coordinate, so I only need to change the y-coordinate by decreasing it (moving DOWN) to get closer.\n\nNow, check the adjacent cells:\n- LEFT: (7,4) \u2014 From the board, this area seems empty or safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,4) \u2014 Likely empty.\n- DOWN: (8,3) \u2014 Row 3 is shown as all empty in the board state.\n- UP: (8,5) \u2014 Not specified, but probably empty.\n\nNo immediate threats from the enemy snake or walls. Moving DOWN to (8,3) reduces the distance to 2 and brings me closer to eating the apple at (8,1). I can repeat this direction until I reach the apple or a better opportunity.\n\nSince the last move was RIGHT (from (8,4) to (9,4)), it might have been a mistake or part of exploration, but I'll prioritize safety and efficiency. Moving DOWN continues my strategy of direct movement toward food.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Eat the apple at (8,1) by consistently moving DOWN and DOWN until it's consumed.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN\n\n**END OF RESPONSE**",

They are very close to the apples at (8, 1) and (7, 1). Given their proximity, it is strategic to concede those apples to the enemy rather than engage in a race I will likely lose.\n    *   **Targets:** The other available apples are at (2, 9), (2, 7), and (0, 4). The cluster at (2, 9) and (2, 7) is the nearest and safest objective.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT (to 6, 8):** This move advances towards the apple cluster at x=2. It reduces the horizontal distance to both the apple at (2, 9) and the apple at (2, 7) simultaneously. By staying on row 8, I maintain the option to branch Up or Down later, keeping my path flexible.\n    *   **UP (to 7, 9):** This moves towards the apple at (2, 9) but increases the distance to the apple at (2, 7).

The distance from (2, 7) to (0, 4) is 5 units.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Option C (Top-to-Bottom sweep) matches the previous rationale and is the most efficient path for the subsequent target. Therefore, the snake must move UP to (3, 9) to position itself for the entry at (2, 9).\n5.  **Safety:** (3, 9) is empty and safe. The enemy snake is at y=0, posing no threat.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nAt (3, 9), move LEFT to consume the first apple at (2, 9), beginning the downward sweep.\n\nUP",

There are no other snakes or obstacles blocking the grid except for my own body.\n\nPossible moves from (4,0) are:\n- LEFT to (3,0): This cell is empty and within bounds.\n- UP to (4,1): This cell is empty and within bounds.\n- RIGHT to (5,0): This is occupied by my body, so invalid.\n- DOWN to (4,-1): This is out of bounds, invalid.\n\nNo apples are adjacent to the head (4,0), so eating an apple is not immediate.

Other apples include (2,7) at dist 9, (0,4) at dist 8, (2,8) at dist 10, and (7,8) at dist 11.\n\nTo reach (2,1), I need to decrease my x-coordinate and optionally decrease y.

There are no immediate dangers or other priorities, so focusing on eating the close apple (2,1) is key.\n\nMy strategy for next turn should be to continue moving left to build momentum toward the left cluster of apples and conserve energy by not rushing to farther apples yet.

Likely route: Move UP to `(6, 8)` to set up capturing the apple at `(7, 8)`, then loop down for the second apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Body segments at (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0). So your occupied cells are {(2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)}.\n- Snake #0: Head at (5,7), body at {(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)}.\n- Apples at: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9)\n\nRecent Move Information:\n- Your last move was \"RIGHT\", which moved your head from (1,1) to (2,1), consuming the apple at (2,1). After this move, your head is at (2,1) and your body has grown to include the new segment (2,2), I think? Let's confirm the body.\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), your head is now at (2,1), and since you grew, the body should have segments: from head (2,1), then previous head (1,1), then head of body (1,0), then (2,0), (3,0). But when you move, you add a new segment at the tail.\n\nBefore move: Head (1,1), body [(1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (3,0)] \u2014 wait, the initial state said Head: (2,1) with Body: [(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)] but (1,1) is part of both head and body? No, let's read: \"Head: (2,1), Body: [(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)]\" so after this turn, I am at (2,1) with body including (1,1) as a segment.\n\nBut in the last move, it says you just moved RIGHT to (2,1) from (1,1). Previously, head was (1,1), body was [(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)] \u2014 so body included (1,1) which is the head position? That doesn't make sense for a snake, the head is separate.\n\nLet's check the initial context.\n\nIn the \"Current State Analysis\" it said: \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right. Apples at: (0, 4), (7, 8), (7, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9) Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (2, 1) - Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)]\"\n\nThen later, the rationale says: \"After this move, your head is at (1,1) \u2014 wait no, the rationale is for the next move, but the state is after last move.\n\nFrom the output: --Your last move information:-- we have:\n\n**Current State Analysis:** - Your snake's head is at (1, 1), with a body occupying [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)] \u2014 that doesn't include (1,1) for body, only head is (1,1). Let's read carefully.\n\nIn the string: \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (2, 1) - Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)]\"\n\nAnd in the board, (2,1) is occupied by you, so when head is at (2,1), (1,1) is also occupied, so the snake is 5 segments long: head (2,1), then body (1,1), then (1,0), etc.\n\nBut in the \"Current State Analysis\" it says: \"head: (1,1)\" \u2014 so there is inconsistency in the provided data.\n\nLet's use the information from the Current State Analysis for this turn:\n\nFrom **START LAST RATIONALE**: \"Your snake's head is at (1, 1), with a body occupying [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)].\"\n\nAnd apples at (2,1), so (2,1) has an apple, and you are at (1,1) with body [(1,0),(2,0),(3,0)], so the head must have been at (1,1) and you moved to (2,1) consuming apple.\n\nSimilarly, for the board, (2,1) has an apple.\n\nNow for the current turn, I need to decide the next move.\n\nFirst, let's find the closest apple or the best target.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,1)\n\nApples remaining: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9) minus the one at (2,1) which was just consumed.\n\n(2,1) apple is gone.\n\nSo apples: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9)\n\nBut (1,7) and (1,9) are at x=1, y=7 and y=9.\n\nCurrent head (1,1)\n\nManhattan distances:\n\n- To (0,4): |1-0| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (7,8): |1-7| + |1-8| = 6 + 7 = 13\n\n- To (7,6): |1-7| + |1-6| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- To (1,7): |1-1| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (1,9): |1-1| + |1-9| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\nAlso, check other threats.\n\nEnemy snake: Head at (5,7), so (5,7) is occupied.\n\nNo snakes blocking immediate paths.\n\nAlso, your own body: from board, you occupy (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), and head at (1,1) \u2014 in Current State, head (1,1), body [(1,0),(2,0),(3,0)] so occupied: (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,1): \n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,1)\n\n- DOWN to (1,0) \u2014 but (1,0) is your own body segment, so invalid.\n\nSo available moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, evaluate each:\n\n- RIGHT to (2,1): Currently, (2,1) has an apple, but we just consumed it, so it should be empty now? The apple is consumed, so (2,1) is empty again.\n\nApples are at (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9) initially, and (2,1) was another one, so 6 apples total, but only (2,1) was mentioned separately? No, the list says apples at (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9) \u2014 and (2,1) is not in the list? In the initial \"Apples at: (0, 4), (7, 8), (7, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)\" so no apple at (2,1) originally.\n\nBut in the board state, (2,1) is shown as \"T\" or something? Let's check the board state.\n\nBoard state: \" 7 . A T T T 0 . . . .\" etc.\n\nPositions: for example, row 7 (y=7) has \" . A T T T 0 . . . .\" so at x=2,y=7 is T, but that's enemy snake.\n\nFor (2,1): y=1, x=2.\n\nRow y=1: In the board, rows from 9 to 0.\n\nRow 9 (y=9): \". . .\" but earlier \"7 . A T T T 0 . . . .\" for y=7.\n\nIn board: \"9 . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 no \"A\" or \"T\" mentioned for y=9 except maybe not.\n\nFrom text: \" 9 . A T . . . . . . .\" \u2014 wait, key for columns.\n\nPerhaps \" A\" is apple at (x,y)?\n\nEasier to list cells.\n\nFind (2,1) on board.\n\ny=1 row, which is the 2nd row from bottom? Rows printed from top y=9 to bottom y=0.\n\ny=0 is row 0, bottom.\n\nCharacter with row 9 is first, so y=9 is row 0 position in the string? No.\n\nThe board is listed with row decreasing numbers, but cells are for each row.\n\nFor example, \"9 . A T . . . . . . .\"\n\nThis is for y=9, x from 0 to 9: ASCII: '.',' ','A','T',' ', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.' no, it's \" 9 . A T . . . . . . \" so likely, the \"9\" is not part of cell, cell at x=0,y=9 is '.' (empty), x=1,y=9 is '.' (from \" . \"? Wait, the string has spaces.\n\nProbably, the board is represented with columns separated.\n\nAssume each line after row number has 10 characters for 10 cells.\n\nFor row 9 (y=9): cells are for x=0 to 9.\n\nString: \" . A T . . . . . . .\"\n\nBut \" . \" might be space or \".\" \u2014 I think it's formatted with spaces, but \" .\" could be a single character cell '.' but it's written with space.\n\nIn text, it's \"9 . A T . . . . . . .\" which is messy.\n\nPerhaps ignore the row label and the period is the cell content.\n\nRow 9: positions x=0 to x=9:\n\n- x=0: '.' (empty)\n\n- x=1: ' ' or '.'? The string is \" 9 . A T ...\" so likely, after row label \"9\", there is a space, then '.' for x=0, then 'A' for x=1, 'T' for x=2, '.' for x=3, etc.\n\nBetter to count characters after row number.\n\nRow 9: \" . A T . . . . . . .\" \u2014 let's remove spaces: the dots and letters are cells.\n\nPerhaps \" . A T . . . . . . .\" with 10 characters: position 0: ' ', but I think \" .\" is meant to be a cell, but it's confusing.\n\nLook at row 7: \"7 . A T T T 0 . . . .\"\n\nThere is \"A T T T 0\" so likely apples and T's.\n\nApple is at (x,y) from the list.\n\nEasier to focus on the apple list and current position.\n\nFrom apples given: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9)\n\nCurrent head is at (1,1) with body including (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), so grid around.\n\nNow, the apple at (1,9) is at x=1, y=9, which is far.\n\nClosest apples to (1,1):\n\n- (0,4): x=0, y=4, |0-1| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (1,7): x=1, y=7, |1-1| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (7,8): etc., farther.\n\nAlso, (1,1) itself, but no apple, we just moved away.\n\nPossible moves: LEFT to (0,1), UP to (1,2), RIGHT to (2,1)\n\n(2,1) has no apple or enemy, but it was previously an apple, now empty.\n\n(0,1) is not in body, (1,2) not in body.\n\nWhat conflicts are there?\n\nEnemy snake: Head at (5,7), so (5,7) occupied.\n\nYour body: (1,0) at bottom, (2,0), (3,0) adjacent.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,1): x decreases, from x=1 to x=0, y=1, so left, y=1 is one above bottom if y=0 bottom.\n\n(0,1) \u2014 Is it safe? No body or enemy there, but needs to check fruits or threats.\n\nBOARD GRID:\n\nCurrent board without apples and snakes: but apples are at specific points.\n\nI think I need to define the board.\n\nList apples: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9)\n\nEnemy: (5,7) and (4,7) etc.\n\nFor (1,1) position, we need to see adjacent cells and path to apples.\n\nPerhaps download the board from state.\n\nRow 9 (y=9): \". . . . . . . . . .\" or from text: \"9 . . . . . . . . . \" look at the board:\n\nIn the text: \" 9 . . . . . . . . . \" wait no, \"9 . A T . . . . . . . \" for y=9, but only parts shown.\n\n\" 9 . A T . . . . . . .\" : for y=9, x=0: '.', x=1: 'A', x=2: 'T', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x5: '.', x6: '.', x7: '.', x8: '.', x9: '.'? String \"9 . A T . . . . . . .\" has 11 characters including \"9\" and spaces, probably \"9\" is not part, cells: from index 2 to 12 or something, confusing.\n\nRow 8: \"8 . . T . . . . A . .\" \n\nEasier to read the text:\n\nRow 9: \"9 . A T . . . . . . .\" so likely cell at x=0: '.' (empty), x=1: 'A' (apple), x=2: 'T' (occupied or enemy), but 'T' might be snake body or head.\n\nIn context, \" T\" for snake parts.\n\nEnemy is Snake #0, head (5,7) etc.\n\nBut for row 7: \"7 . A T T T 0 . . . .\" so x=0: '.', x=1: 'A', x=2: 'T', x=3: 'T', x=4: 'T', x=5: '0' (enemy head?), x=6: '.', etc.\n\nBut (5,7) is enemy head, so x=5,y=7 is 0.\n\nBut in move position, at (1,1), which is y=1, not shown directly.\n\nPerhaps list all occupied cells.\n\nMy snake occupied: (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0) \u2014 from body and head.\n\nEnemy: (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nApple positions.\n\nFor Current State, head at (1,1), body [(1,0), (2,0), (3,0)] so occupied cells: (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)\n\nApple at (2,1) is gone, as consumed one turn ago.\n\nThe apples are: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9) \u2014 (2,1) was not listed, so maybe (2,1) was a typo or missed in initial list.\n\nIn the initial, \"Apples at: (0, 4), (7, 8), (7, 6), (1, 7), (1,9)\" so only 5 apples, but (2,1) was there from board.\n\nI think we have to consider the board state.\n\nFor (1,1), possible moves:\n\n- LEFT to (0,1)\n- UP to (1,2)\n- RIGHT to (2,1)\n\nNow, (2,1) is likely empty, as apple is gone.\n\nWhat is at (2,1)? Not specified, so safe assumption is empty unless threatened.\n\n(0,1) similarly.\n\n(1,2) likely empty.\n\nApple closest is (0,4) at distance 4.\n\nBut (0,4) is at x=0, y=4, so x decreases from 1 to 0, y increases from 1 to 4.\n\nTo go to (0,4), from (1,1), I need to move left to (0,1), then up to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), but (0, 3) might be path.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nFirst, check if there are any enemies or apples near.\n\nEnemy is at y=7, far away for now.\n\nApples: (0,4) at (x=0,y=4), so from (1,1) to (0,4) Manhattan 4, but with turns.\n\nPossible to move to (0,4) or directly to (0,4) if on the way.\n\nBut I need to choose a move.\n\nAlso, since I just consumed an apple, I should keep moving towards apples or avoid enemies.\n\nEnemy might move, but we don't know how, only that it exists.\n\nTo avoid risk, don't move towards enemy if possible.\n\nEnemy is at (5,7), high y (top), so move to higher y or lower y if available.\n\nCurrent y=1, low, many empty cells below.\n\nBut y=1 is bottom, row y=0 is lower.\n\nLet's define coordinates properly.\n\nY=0 bottom, y=9 top, so decreasing y is down, increasing y is up.\n\nSo from (1,1), moving UP increases y, moving LEFT decreases x.\n\nTo reach (0,4), I need to decrease x from 1 to 0, increase y from 1 to 4.\n\nFirst, I need to go to a cell with low cost.\n\nAvailable moves: (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)\n\nCheck each for safety and benefit.\n\n- (0,1): x=0, y=1, which is left from (1,1). Distance to (0,4): |0-0| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3, but I am moving to (0,1), so from (0,1), distance to (0,4) is |0-0| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) to (1,2): (1,2) to (0,4) |1-0| + |2-4| =1 + 2 =3.\n\n(2,1) to (0,4) |2-0| + |1-4| =2 + 3 =5.\n\nBut (2,1) is closer in terms of x? No, to reach (0,4), moving to (0,1) reduces x by 1, but y same, then I need 3 up y.\n\nMoving to (1,2) increases y but x same, then 1 left and 2 up or something.\n\nPerhaps minimize the max or sum.\n\nBut there might be shorter paths for other apples.\n\nThere is also apple at (1,7) at (1,7), from (1,1) |1-1| + |1-7| =6, farther.\n\nBut (1,7) is in colomn x=1, same x as current, so only y increase from 1 to 7, need to go up.\n\nFrom (1,1), if I move right, (2,1), then from (2,1) go up to (2,2), etc. to (2,4) then to (0,4).\n\nAfter moving, I can reassess.\n\nBut let's list all apples:\n\n- (0,4): Distance 4\n\n- (7,8): 13\n\n- (7,6): 11\n\n- (1,7): 6\n\n- (1,9): 8\n\nSo (0,4) is closest, at y=4, x=0.\n\nCurrent position y=1, so increase y by 3.\n\nX from 1 to 0, change.\n\nFor moving to (-1,1), but y=1 is not bottom, y=0 is, but (0,1) is valid.\n\nNow, possible moves:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,1):\n\n- No body or enemy, so safe.\n\nBut (0,1), is there an apple or something? Not specified, so no gain.\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (1,2), no gain, safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), no apple, safe.\n\nBut from (2,1), I might be closer to some apples, but (2,1) to (0,4) is farther.\n\nSince the board is small, I can move towards (0,4) with minimal risk.\n\nBut there is enemy, might threaten in future.\n\nPerhaps move to increase y, since most apples are at higher y: (0,4) y=4, (7,8) y=8, (7,6) y=6, (1,7) y=7, (1,9) y=9, so generally higher y.\n\nCurrent y=1 is low, so moving up is good.\n\nMoving left or right might not gain.\n\nBut (0,4) is at low x, so from (1,1) I need to decrease x sometimes.\n\nBut first, from (1,1), moving UP to (1,2) would be safer to avoid x change, but eventually I need to decrease x for (0,4).\n\nAlternatively, move LEFT to (0,1) to start towards (0,4), but I need to go up from there.\n\nBut (0,1) might lead to danger if enemy comes, but enemy is at y=7, far.\n\nSince I just ate, I can grow in length, but no (a, the board is 10x10, so no immediate threat.\n\nBut let's see the last move rationale: \"Therefore, moving to (2, 1) is the most beneficial: it directly consumes the closest apple, eliminating it from the board...\"\n\nBut for the current turn, the apple at (2,1) is gone.\n\nAnd in Current State, head at (1,1).\n\nSo no apple here.\n\nFor next move, I should not pursue (2,1) as no apple.\n\nGo for (0,4) as closest.\n\nOr (1,7) at dist 6, but y change.\n\nPerhaps evaluate the next cell if I go in each direction.\n\nOptionally, I can move to a cell that is on the way to multiple apples.\n\nBut (0,4) is isolated.\n\nApples at (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9)\n\n(7,6) and (1,7) are at high y, (0,4) medium low y.\n\n(1,9) very high y.\n\nBut y=9 is top, very risky if enemies there.\n\nEnemy at y=7, so middle.\n\nFor (0,4), it's below enemy area, might be safer to avoid enemy.\n\nSimilarly, other apples.\n\nBut (0,4) is at y=4, x=0.\n\nFrom (1,1), y=1 to 4, x=1 to 0.\n\nManhattan 4.\n\nPossible path: move UP to (1,2), then UP to (1,3), then LEFT to (0,3), then UP to (0,4). 4 moves.\n\nFrom (1,1) move LEFT to (0,1), then UP to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), same.\n\nAvoid moving diagonally, but can only move one direction at a time.\n\nBut moving LEFT might be better to reduce x sooner.\n\nBut (0,1) has no particular threat.\n\nSimilarly, UP has no threat.\n\nBut the enemy might move, but we don't know, so I should stay away from it.\n\nEnemy is at (5,7), so moving to low x and low y is safer.\n\n(0,4) is global min x and not too high y.\n\nAnother apple is (1,7) at same x, I need to go up from y=1 to 7, also safe if no enemies.\n\nBut dist 6 vs 4 for (0,4).\n\nSo (0,4) closer.\n\nBut in terms of risk, (0,4) is closer to walls or something, but no, board empty usually.\n\nCurrent board, around (1,1): y=1 row, x=1.\n\nRow y=1: not listed, but cells: (0,1) empty? not sure.\n\n(2,1) empty.\n\n(1,2) empty.\n\nNo one there, so all good.\n\nPerhaps I should move towards (0,4) with a direct path.\n\nFrom (1,1), available moves: LEFT, UP, RIGHT.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,1), I am at (0,1), distance to (0,4) is 3 in y.\n\nThen from (0,1) to (0,4) with 3 UP moves.\n\nBut to avoid blocking, but no, snake grows, can block, but board empty, no.\n\nIf I move UP to (1,2), distance to (0,4) |1-0| + |2-4| =1+2=3, then from (1,2) to (0,4) need to go to (0,2) or (1,4), etc.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut moving LEFT might be better to decrease x now, since (0,4) has low x.\n\nSo from (1,1), move LEFT to (0,1).\n\nThen, from (0,1), I can move UP to (0,2), etc.\n\nAlso, check if (0,1) has an apple or something, but not, so no gain.\n\nBut safety-wise, it's fine.\n\nI could move UP to (1,2) first.\n\nBut to minimize distance, moving LEFT might be efficient for reaching left side.\n\nSince enemy is on right (high x), left is safer.\n\nSimilarly, apples at x=0,7, so one low x, one high x.\n\nBut I should focus on the closest accessible apple.\n\nAnother thing: the board has fruits at (0,4), etc., but I need to eat to grow.\n\nNo immediate need.\n\nAlso, last move, I moved RIGHT, so perhaps change direction to avoid being stuck, but not necessarily.\n\nLet's decide on a strategy for this turn.\n\nI think moving towards (0,4) is best.\n\nFrom current position, LEFT is a closer path to (0,4).\n\nDistance to (0,4) from (1,1): |0-1| + |4-1| =1+3=4\n\nFrom (0,1): |0-0| + |4-1| =0+3=3\n\nFrom (1,2): |0-1| + |4-2| =1+2=3\n\nSo equal to 3 if I move in a direction.\n\nBut to reach (0,4) directly, I need to change x or y.\n\nBut since x needs to decrease, moving LEFT is a good first step.\n\nMoving UP also decreases distance to 3.\n\nBut moving LEFT reduces the x-component.\n\nI think move LEFT to (0,1) is safe and sets up for reaching (0,4).\n\nSimilarly, I can do the same for subsequent moves.\n\nBut let's see the enemy; no immediate threat.\n\nSo, I will choose to move LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (1,1)\n\nAfter moving LEFT, head to (0,1)\n\n(0,1): is it free? Not occupied, from board or general knowledge, yes.\n\nNo apple there.\n\nThen, next turn, I can move UP to (0,2), etc.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After this move, keep moving towards (0,4), and after consuming, choose another apple.\n\nSince the board is small, I might need to sweep the board or something, but let's prioritize (0,4) as closest.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to output the next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nAlso, think out loud and state a strategy.\n\nEnd with the move.\n\nSo, decided next move: LEFT\n**Current state recap:**\n- Your snake head is at (1,1), with body segments at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0). So occupied cells include (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0).\n- Apples remaining: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9) \u2014 the apple at (2,1) was consumed in the last move.\n- Enemy snake: Head at (5,7) with body segments, occupying cells like (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), etc. (from Snake #0 state). This snake is far from your current position, posing no immediate threat.\n- Your snake has just consumed an apple, so you are growing and gaining points, but no immediate risks from walls or collisions beyond the current position.\n- The Manhattan distance to the remaining apples from (1,1) is:\n  - (0,4): |1-0| + |1-4| = 4\n  - (7,8): |1-7| + |1-8| = 13\n  - (7,6): |1-7| + |1-6| = 11\n  - (1,7): |1-1| + |1-7| = 6\n  - (1,9): |1-1| + |1-9| = 8\n- (0,4) is the closest apple, at distance 4, and it's located at a lower x-coordinate (x=0, y=4), which is 1 unit left and up from current position.\n\n**Evaluate available moves from (1,1):**\n- UP to (1,2): No apple or threat there, but moving up alone reduces distance to some apples (e.g., to (0,4) becomes 3: |1-0| + |2-4| = 3) but doesn't change x-coordinate. This is generally safer but might delay reaching apples that require x-decrease.\n- LEFT to (0,1): No apple or threat, reduces Manhattan distance to (0,4) to 3 (|0-0| + |1-4| = 3) and cuts the x-distance. Since (0,4) is a key target with low x, moving left first is efficient for that apple.\n- DOWN to (1,0): Invalid, as (1,0) is part of your body, would cause collision.\n\n**Why not other options?**\n- Moving UP might be slightly safer for navigation, but moving LEFT directly contributes to reducing the x-distance for the primary target (0,4), making the path shorter quickly. Other apples like (1,7) or (1,9) are farther and along the same x-column (x=1), so moving left only makes sense for (0,4) but could open opportunities for other apples after.\n- No immediate risk of collision with enemy or wall from current position, but keeping movement away from high-y areas (where enemy is based at y=7) is wise for survival.\n\n**Strategy for this turn:**\n- Move LEFT to (0,1) to get closer to (0,4) and begin the path toward it. After this move, you should not gain points, but you'll be closer to the next opportunity. Then, on the next turn, move UP to (0,2) if possible to reach (0,4), then adjust based on the board state. Monitor for enemy threats and apple availability.\n\n**Next move:**\nLEFT",

No immediate danger.\n\n2.  **Candidate Moves:**\n    *   **RIGHT `(6, 7)`:**\n        *   **Pros:** This move places the head centrally between the two target apples at `(7, 8)` and `(7, 6)`. It maintains the most flexibility. From `(6, 7)`, I can easily curve UP to get the top apple or DOWN to get the bottom one.\n        *   **Cons:** None. The space is open.\n    *   **UP `(5, 8)`:**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves closer to apple `(7, 8)`. Useable path: `(5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8)`.\n        *   **Cons:** Slightly commits to the top path earlier than necessary. Moving Right first achieves the same distance efficiency (Manhattan distance) but keeps the y-axis aligned with the center until the decision point.\n    *   **DOWN `(5, 6)`:**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves closer to apple `(7, 6)`.\n        *   **Cons:** Similar to UP, it commits to the bottom path immediately.\n\n3.  **Pathfinding:**\n    *   Starting with **RIGHT** to `(6, 7)` sets up a perfect \"fork\".\n    *   Path A: `(6, 7) -> UP (6, 8) -> RIGHT (7, 8)` (Eat apple) -> `DOWN (7, 7) -> DOWN (7, 6)` (Eat apple).\n    *   Path B: `(6, 7) -> DOWN (6, 6) -> RIGHT (7, 6)` (Eat apple) -> `UP (7, 7) -> UP (7, 8)` (Eat apple).\n    *   Both paths allow capturing 2 apples in 5 moves. Moving RIGHT is the first step for both.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Moving RIGHT takes advantage of the open space on the right side of the board and optimally positions the snake to harvest the pair of apples in column 7.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nFrom `(6, 7)`, choose a target. Likely route: Move UP to `(6, 8)` to set up capturing the apple at `(7, 8)`, then loop down for the second apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Body segments at (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0). So your occupied cells are {(2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)}.\n- Snake #0: Head at (5,7), body at {(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)}.\n- Apples at: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9)\n\nRecent Move Information:\n- Your last move was \"RIGHT\", which moved your head from (1,1) to (2,1), consuming the apple at (2,1). After this move, your head is at (2,1) and your body has grown to include the new segment (2,2), I think? Let's confirm the body.\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), your head is now at (2,1), and since you grew, the body should have segments: from head (2,1), then previous head (1,1), then head of body (1,0), then (2,0), (3,0). But when you move, you add a new segment at the tail.\n\nBefore move: Head (1,1), body [(1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (3,0)] \u2014 wait, the initial state said Head: (2,1) with Body: [(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)] but (1,1) is part of both head and body? No, let's read: \"Head: (2,1), Body: [(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)]\" so after this turn, I am at (2,1) with body including (1,1) as a segment.\n\nBut in the last move, it says you just moved RIGHT to (2,1) from (1,1). Previously, head was (1,1), body was [(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)] \u2014 so body included (1,1) which is the head position? That doesn't make sense for a snake, the head is separate.\n\nLet's check the initial context.\n\nIn the \"Current State Analysis\" it said: \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right. Apples at: (0, 4), (7, 8), (7, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9) Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (2, 1) - Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)]\"\n\nThen later, the rationale says: \"After this move, your head is at (1,1) \u2014 wait no, the rationale is for the next move, but the state is after last move.\n\nFrom the output: --Your last move information:-- we have:\n\n**Current State Analysis:** - Your snake's head is at (1, 1), with a body occupying [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)] \u2014 that doesn't include (1,1) for body, only head is (1,1). Let's read carefully.\n\nIn the string: \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (2, 1) - Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)]\"\n\nAnd in the board, (2,1) is occupied by you, so when head is at (2,1), (1,1) is also occupied, so the snake is 5 segments long: head (2,1), then body (1,1), then (1,0), etc.\n\nBut in the \"Current State Analysis\" it says: \"head: (1,1)\" \u2014 so there is inconsistency in the provided data.\n\nLet's use the information from the Current State Analysis for this turn:\n\nFrom **START LAST RATIONALE**: \"Your snake's head is at (1, 1), with a body occupying [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)].\"\n\nAnd apples at (2,1), so (2,1) has an apple, and you are at (1,1) with body [(1,0),(2,0),(3,0)], so the head must have been at (1,1) and you moved to (2,1) consuming apple.\n\nSimilarly, for the board, (2,1) has an apple.\n\nNow for the current turn, I need to decide the next move.\n\nFirst, let's find the closest apple or the best target.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,1)\n\nApples remaining: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9) minus the one at (2,1) which was just consumed.\n\n(2,1) apple is gone.\n\nSo apples: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9)\n\nBut (1,7) and (1,9) are at x=1, y=7 and y=9.\n\nCurrent head (1,1)\n\nManhattan distances:\n\n- To (0,4): |1-0| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (7,8): |1-7| + |1-8| = 6 + 7 = 13\n\n- To (7,6): |1-7| + |1-6| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- To (1,7): |1-1| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (1,9): |1-1| + |1-9| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\nAlso, check other threats.\n\nEnemy snake: Head at (5,7), so (5,7) is occupied.\n\nNo snakes blocking immediate paths.\n\nAlso, your own body: from board, you occupy (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), and head at (1,1) \u2014 in Current State, head (1,1), body [(1,0),(2,0),(3,0)] so occupied: (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,1): \n\n- UP to (1,2)\n\n- LEFT to (0,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (2,1)\n\n- DOWN to (1,0) \u2014 but (1,0) is your own body segment, so invalid.\n\nSo available moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, evaluate each:\n\n- RIGHT to (2,1): Currently, (2,1) has an apple, but we just consumed it, so it should be empty now? The apple is consumed, so (2,1) is empty again.\n\nApples are at (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9) initially, and (2,1) was another one, so 6 apples total, but only (2,1) was mentioned separately? No, the list says apples at (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9) \u2014 and (2,1) is not in the list? In the initial \"Apples at: (0, 4), (7, 8), (7, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)\" so no apple at (2,1) originally.\n\nBut in the board state, (2,1) is shown as \"T\" or something? Let's check the board state.\n\nBoard state: \" 7 . A T T T 0 . . . .\" etc.\n\nPositions: for example, row 7 (y=7) has \" . A T T T 0 . . . .\" so at x=2,y=7 is T, but that's enemy snake.\n\nFor (2,1): y=1, x=2.\n\nRow y=1: In the board, rows from 9 to 0.\n\nRow 9 (y=9): \". . .\" but earlier \"7 . A T T T 0 . . . .\" for y=7.\n\nIn board: \"9 . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 no \"A\" or \"T\" mentioned for y=9 except maybe not.\n\nFrom text: \" 9 . A T . . . . . . .\" \u2014 wait, key for columns.\n\nPerhaps \" A\" is apple at (x,y)?\n\nEasier to list cells.\n\nFind (2,1) on board.\n\ny=1 row, which is the 2nd row from bottom? Rows printed from top y=9 to bottom y=0.\n\ny=0 is row 0, bottom.\n\nCharacter with row 9 is first, so y=9 is row 0 position in the string? No.\n\nThe board is listed with row decreasing numbers, but cells are for each row.\n\nFor example, \"9 . A T . . . . . . .\"\n\nThis is for y=9, x from 0 to 9: ASCII: '.',' ','A','T',' ', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.' no, it's \" 9 . A T . . . . . . \" so likely, the \"9\" is not part of cell, cell at x=0,y=9 is '.' (empty), x=1,y=9 is '.' (from \" . \"? Wait, the string has spaces.\n\nProbably, the board is represented with columns separated.\n\nAssume each line after row number has 10 characters for 10 cells.\n\nFor row 9 (y=9): cells are for x=0 to 9.\n\nString: \" . A T . . . . . . .\"\n\nBut \" . \" might be space or \".\" \u2014 I think it's formatted with spaces, but \" .\" could be a single character cell '.' but it's written with space.\n\nIn text, it's \"9 . A T . . . . . . .\" which is messy.\n\nPerhaps ignore the row label and the period is the cell content.\n\nRow 9: positions x=0 to x=9:\n\n- x=0: '.' (empty)\n\n- x=1: ' ' or '.'? The string is \" 9 . A T ...\" so likely, after row label \"9\", there is a space, then '.' for x=0, then 'A' for x=1, 'T' for x=2, '.' for x=3, etc.\n\nBetter to count characters after row number.\n\nRow 9: \" . A T . . . . . . .\" \u2014 let's remove spaces: the dots and letters are cells.\n\nPerhaps \" . A T . . . . . . .\" with 10 characters: position 0: ' ', but I think \" .\" is meant to be a cell, but it's confusing.\n\nLook at row 7: \"7 . A T T T 0 . . . .\"\n\nThere is \"A T T T 0\" so likely apples and T's.\n\nApple is at (x,y) from the list.\n\nEasier to focus on the apple list and current position.\n\nFrom apples given: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9)\n\nCurrent head is at (1,1) with body including (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), so grid around.\n\nNow, the apple at (1,9) is at x=1, y=9, which is far.\n\nClosest apples to (1,1):\n\n- (0,4): x=0, y=4, |0-1| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (1,7): x=1, y=7, |1-1| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (7,8): etc., farther.\n\nAlso, (1,1) itself, but no apple, we just moved away.\n\nPossible moves: LEFT to (0,1), UP to (1,2), RIGHT to (2,1)\n\n(2,1) has no apple or enemy, but it was previously an apple, now empty.\n\n(0,1) is not in body, (1,2) not in body.\n\nWhat conflicts are there?\n\nEnemy snake: Head at (5,7), so (5,7) occupied.\n\nYour body: (1,0) at bottom, (2,0), (3,0) adjacent.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,1): x decreases, from x=1 to x=0, y=1, so left, y=1 is one above bottom if y=0 bottom.\n\n(0,1) \u2014 Is it safe? No body or enemy there, but needs to check fruits or threats.\n\nBOARD GRID:\n\nCurrent board without apples and snakes: but apples are at specific points.\n\nI think I need to define the board.\n\nList apples: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9)\n\nEnemy: (5,7) and (4,7) etc.\n\nFor (1,1) position, we need to see adjacent cells and path to apples.\n\nPerhaps download the board from state.\n\nRow 9 (y=9): \". . . . . . . . . .\" or from text: \"9 . . . . . . . . . \" look at the board:\n\nIn the text: \" 9 . . . . . . . . . \" wait no, \"9 . A T . . . . . . . \" for y=9, but only parts shown.\n\n\" 9 . A T . . . . . . .\" : for y=9, x=0: '.', x=1: 'A', x=2: 'T', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x5: '.', x6: '.', x7: '.', x8: '.', x9: '.'? String \"9 . A T . . . . . . .\" has 11 characters including \"9\" and spaces, probably \"9\" is not part, cells: from index 2 to 12 or something, confusing.\n\nRow 8: \"8 . . T . . . . A . .\" \n\nEasier to read the text:\n\nRow 9: \"9 . A T . . . . . . .\" so likely cell at x=0: '.' (empty), x=1: 'A' (apple), x=2: 'T' (occupied or enemy), but 'T' might be snake body or head.\n\nIn context, \" T\" for snake parts.\n\nEnemy is Snake #0, head (5,7) etc.\n\nBut for row 7: \"7 . A T T T 0 . . . .\" so x=0: '.', x=1: 'A', x=2: 'T', x=3: 'T', x=4: 'T', x=5: '0' (enemy head?), x=6: '.', etc.\n\nBut (5,7) is enemy head, so x=5,y=7 is 0.\n\nBut in move position, at (1,1), which is y=1, not shown directly.\n\nPerhaps list all occupied cells.\n\nMy snake occupied: (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0) \u2014 from body and head.\n\nEnemy: (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)\n\nApple positions.\n\nFor Current State, head at (1,1), body [(1,0), (2,0), (3,0)] so occupied cells: (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)\n\nApple at (2,1) is gone, as consumed one turn ago.\n\nThe apples are: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9) \u2014 (2,1) was not listed, so maybe (2,1) was a typo or missed in initial list.\n\nIn the initial, \"Apples at: (0, 4), (7, 8), (7, 6), (1, 7), (1,9)\" so only 5 apples, but (2,1) was there from board.\n\nI think we have to consider the board state.\n\nFor (1,1), possible moves:\n\n- LEFT to (0,1)\n- UP to (1,2)\n- RIGHT to (2,1)\n\nNow, (2,1) is likely empty, as apple is gone.\n\nWhat is at (2,1)? Not specified, so safe assumption is empty unless threatened.\n\n(0,1) similarly.\n\n(1,2) likely empty.\n\nApple closest is (0,4) at distance 4.\n\nBut (0,4) is at x=0, y=4, so x decreases from 1 to 0, y increases from 1 to 4.\n\nTo go to (0,4), from (1,1), I need to move left to (0,1), then up to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), but (0, 3) might be path.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nFirst, check if there are any enemies or apples near.\n\nEnemy is at y=7, far away for now.\n\nApples: (0,4) at (x=0,y=4), so from (1,1) to (0,4) Manhattan 4, but with turns.\n\nPossible to move to (0,4) or directly to (0,4) if on the way.\n\nBut I need to choose a move.\n\nAlso, since I just consumed an apple, I should keep moving towards apples or avoid enemies.\n\nEnemy might move, but we don't know how, only that it exists.\n\nTo avoid risk, don't move towards enemy if possible.\n\nEnemy is at (5,7), high y (top), so move to higher y or lower y if available.\n\nCurrent y=1, low, many empty cells below.\n\nBut y=1 is bottom, row y=0 is lower.\n\nLet's define coordinates properly.\n\nY=0 bottom, y=9 top, so decreasing y is down, increasing y is up.\n\nSo from (1,1), moving UP increases y, moving LEFT decreases x.\n\nTo reach (0,4), I need to decrease x from 1 to 0, increase y from 1 to 4.\n\nFirst, I need to go to a cell with low cost.\n\nAvailable moves: (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)\n\nCheck each for safety and benefit.\n\n- (0,1): x=0, y=1, which is left from (1,1). Distance to (0,4): |0-0| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3, but I am moving to (0,1), so from (0,1), distance to (0,4) is |0-0| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) to (1,2): (1,2) to (0,4) |1-0| + |2-4| =1 + 2 =3.\n\n(2,1) to (0,4) |2-0| + |1-4| =2 + 3 =5.\n\nBut (2,1) is closer in terms of x? No, to reach (0,4), moving to (0,1) reduces x by 1, but y same, then I need 3 up y.\n\nMoving to (1,2) increases y but x same, then 1 left and 2 up or something.\n\nPerhaps minimize the max or sum.\n\nBut there might be shorter paths for other apples.\n\nThere is also apple at (1,7) at (1,7), from (1,1) |1-1| + |1-7| =6, farther.\n\nBut (1,7) is in colomn x=1, same x as current, so only y increase from 1 to 7, need to go up.\n\nFrom (1,1), if I move right, (2,1), then from (2,1) go up to (2,2), etc. to (2,4) then to (0,4).\n\nAfter moving, I can reassess.\n\nBut let's list all apples:\n\n- (0,4): Distance 4\n\n- (7,8): 13\n\n- (7,6): 11\n\n- (1,7): 6\n\n- (1,9): 8\n\nSo (0,4) is closest, at y=4, x=0.\n\nCurrent position y=1, so increase y by 3.\n\nX from 1 to 0, change.\n\nFor moving to (-1,1), but y=1 is not bottom, y=0 is, but (0,1) is valid.\n\nNow, possible moves:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,1):\n\n- No body or enemy, so safe.\n\nBut (0,1), is there an apple or something? Not specified, so no gain.\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (1,2), no gain, safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), no apple, safe.\n\nBut from (2,1), I might be closer to some apples, but (2,1) to (0,4) is farther.\n\nSince the board is small, I can move towards (0,4) with minimal risk.\n\nBut there is enemy, might threaten in future.\n\nPerhaps move to increase y, since most apples are at higher y: (0,4) y=4, (7,8) y=8, (7,6) y=6, (1,7) y=7, (1,9) y=9, so generally higher y.\n\nCurrent y=1 is low, so moving up is good.\n\nMoving left or right might not gain.\n\nBut (0,4) is at low x, so from (1,1) I need to decrease x sometimes.\n\nBut first, from (1,1), moving UP to (1,2) would be safer to avoid x change, but eventually I need to decrease x for (0,4).\n\nAlternatively, move LEFT to (0,1) to start towards (0,4), but I need to go up from there.\n\nBut (0,1) might lead to danger if enemy comes, but enemy is at y=7, far.\n\nSince I just ate, I can grow in length, but no (a, the board is 10x10, so no immediate threat.\n\nBut let's see the last move rationale: \"Therefore, moving to (2, 1) is the most beneficial: it directly consumes the closest apple, eliminating it from the board...\"\n\nBut for the current turn, the apple at (2,1) is gone.\n\nAnd in Current State, head at (1,1).\n\nSo no apple here.\n\nFor next move, I should not pursue (2,1) as no apple.\n\nGo for (0,4) as closest.\n\nOr (1,7) at dist 6, but y change.\n\nPerhaps evaluate the next cell if I go in each direction.\n\nOptionally, I can move to a cell that is on the way to multiple apples.\n\nBut (0,4) is isolated.\n\nApples at (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9)\n\n(7,6) and (1,7) are at high y, (0,4) medium low y.\n\n(1,9) very high y.\n\nBut y=9 is top, very risky if enemies there.\n\nEnemy at y=7, so middle.\n\nFor (0,4), it's below enemy area, might be safer to avoid enemy.\n\nSimilarly, other apples.\n\nBut (0,4) is at y=4, x=0.\n\nFrom (1,1), y=1 to 4, x=1 to 0.\n\nManhattan 4.\n\nPossible path: move UP to (1,2), then UP to (1,3), then LEFT to (0,3), then UP to (0,4). 4 moves.\n\nFrom (1,1) move LEFT to (0,1), then UP to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), same.\n\nAvoid moving diagonally, but can only move one direction at a time.\n\nBut moving LEFT might be better to reduce x sooner.\n\nBut (0,1) has no particular threat.\n\nSimilarly, UP has no threat.\n\nBut the enemy might move, but we don't know, so I should stay away from it.\n\nEnemy is at (5,7), so moving to low x and low y is safer.\n\n(0,4) is global min x and not too high y.\n\nAnother apple is (1,7) at same x, I need to go up from y=1 to 7, also safe if no enemies.\n\nBut dist 6 vs 4 for (0,4).\n\nSo (0,4) closer.\n\nBut in terms of risk, (0,4) is closer to walls or something, but no, board empty usually.\n\nCurrent board, around (1,1): y=1 row, x=1.\n\nRow y=1: not listed, but cells: (0,1) empty? not sure.\n\n(2,1) empty.\n\n(1,2) empty.\n\nNo one there, so all good.\n\nPerhaps I should move towards (0,4) with a direct path.\n\nFrom (1,1), available moves: LEFT, UP, RIGHT.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,1), I am at (0,1), distance to (0,4) is 3 in y.\n\nThen from (0,1) to (0,4) with 3 UP moves.\n\nBut to avoid blocking, but no, snake grows, can block, but board empty, no.\n\nIf I move UP to (1,2), distance to (0,4) |1-0| + |2-4| =1+2=3, then from (1,2) to (0,4) need to go to (0,2) or (1,4), etc.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut moving LEFT might be better to decrease x now, since (0,4) has low x.\n\nSo from (1,1), move LEFT to (0,1).\n\nThen, from (0,1), I can move UP to (0,2), etc.\n\nAlso, check if (0,1) has an apple or something, but not, so no gain.\n\nBut safety-wise, it's fine.\n\nI could move UP to (1,2) first.\n\nBut to minimize distance, moving LEFT might be efficient for reaching left side.\n\nSince enemy is on right (high x), left is safer.\n\nSimilarly, apples at x=0,7, so one low x, one high x.\n\nBut I should focus on the closest accessible apple.\n\nAnother thing: the board has fruits at (0,4), etc., but I need to eat to grow.\n\nNo immediate need.\n\nAlso, last move, I moved RIGHT, so perhaps change direction to avoid being stuck, but not necessarily.\n\nLet's decide on a strategy for this turn.\n\nI think moving towards (0,4) is best.\n\nFrom current position, LEFT is a closer path to (0,4).\n\nDistance to (0,4) from (1,1): |0-1| + |4-1| =1+3=4\n\nFrom (0,1): |0-0| + |4-1| =0+3=3\n\nFrom (1,2): |0-1| + |4-2| =1+2=3\n\nSo equal to 3 if I move in a direction.\n\nBut to reach (0,4) directly, I need to change x or y.\n\nBut since x needs to decrease, moving LEFT is a good first step.\n\nMoving UP also decreases distance to 3.\n\nBut moving LEFT reduces the x-component.\n\nI think move LEFT to (0,1) is safe and sets up for reaching (0,4).\n\nSimilarly, I can do the same for subsequent moves.\n\nBut let's see the enemy; no immediate threat.\n\nSo, I will choose to move LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nCurrent head: (1,1)\n\nAfter moving LEFT, head to (0,1)\n\n(0,1): is it free? Not occupied, from board or general knowledge, yes.\n\nNo apple there.\n\nThen, next turn, I can move UP to (0,2), etc.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After this move, keep moving towards (0,4), and after consuming, choose another apple.\n\nSince the board is small, I might need to sweep the board or something, but let's prioritize (0,4) as closest.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to output the next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nAlso, think out loud and state a strategy.\n\nEnd with the move.\n\nSo, decided next move: LEFT\n**Current state recap:**\n- Your snake head is at (1,1), with body segments at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0). So occupied cells include (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0).\n- Apples remaining: (0,4), (7,8), (7,6), (1,7), (1,9) \u2014 the apple at (2,1) was consumed in the last move.\n- Enemy snake: Head at (5,7) with body segments, occupying cells like (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), etc. (from Snake #0 state). This snake is far from your current position, posing no immediate threat.\n- Your snake has just consumed an apple, so you are growing and gaining points, but no immediate risks from walls or collisions beyond the current position.\n- The Manhattan distance to the remaining apples from (1,1) is:\n  - (0,4): |1-0| + |1-4| = 4\n  - (7,8): |1-7| + |1-8| = 13\n  - (7,6): |1-7| + |1-6| = 11\n  - (1,7): |1-1| + |1-7| = 6\n  - (1,9): |1-1| + |1-9| = 8\n- (0,4) is the closest apple, at distance 4, and it's located at a lower x-coordinate (x=0, y=4), which is 1 unit left and up from current position.\n\n**Evaluate available moves from (1,1):**\n- UP to (1,2): No apple or threat there, but moving up alone reduces distance to some apples (e.g., to (0,4) becomes 3: |1-0| + |2-4| = 3) but doesn't change x-coordinate. This is generally safer but might delay reaching apples that require x-decrease.\n- LEFT to (0,1): No apple or threat, reduces Manhattan distance to (0,4) to 3 (|0-0| + |1-4| = 3) and cuts the x-distance. Since (0,4) is a key target with low x, moving left first is efficient for that apple.\n- DOWN to (1,0): Invalid, as (1,0) is part of your body, would cause collision.\n\n**Why not other options?**\n- Moving UP might be slightly safer for navigation, but moving LEFT directly contributes to reducing the x-distance for the primary target (0,4), making the path shorter quickly. Other apples like (1,7) or (1,9) are farther and along the same x-column (x=1), so moving left only makes sense for (0,4) but could open opportunities for other apples after.\n- No immediate risk of collision with enemy or wall from current position, but keeping movement away from high-y areas (where enemy is based at y=7) is wise for survival.\n\n**Strategy for this turn:**\n- Move LEFT to (0,1) to get closer to (0,4) and begin the path toward it. After this move, you should not gain points, but you'll be closer to the next opportunity. Then, on the next turn, move UP to (0,2) if possible to reach (0,4), then adjust based on the board state. Monitor for enemy threats and apple availability.\n\n**Next move:**\nLEFT",
