Moving into (6,5) would collide with Snake #1's head, so that's dangerous.\n   - UP: (6,7) - Safe (empty cell).\n   - DOWN: (6,5) - Collision with Snake #1 (dangerous).\n   - LEFT: (5,6) - Safe (empty cell).\n   - RIGHT: (7,6) - Safe (empty cell).\n\n2. **Apple Accessibility:** The closest apples to my head (6,6) are:\n   - (3,9) and (2,9) at a Manhattan distance of 12 (3+9=12 for x,y).\n   - (2,7) and (0,8) at a distance of 10 (2+7=9, 6+6=12; 0+8=8, 6+6=12).\n   - (1,2) is farthest at a distance of 11 (6+6=12, 1+2=3; Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |6-2| = 5 + 4 = 9).\n\n   The apple at (2,7) is the most reachable in terms of Manhattan distance (9), but it's not directly adjacent. The apples at (0,8), (3,9), and (2,9) are farther away.\n\n3. **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (6,5), directly below me. If I move DOWN, we'd collide head-on and both die. If I move LEFT or RIGHT, Snake #1 can move UP into (6,6) on its turn, causing a collision. So, moving UP is the only move that doesn't risk an immediate collision with Snake #1.\n\n4. **Future Traps:** Moving LEFT or RIGHT would leave me vulnerable to Snake #1's next move (UP), as it would occupy (6,6) on its turn. Moving UP is safer because Snake #1 cannot move into (6,7) on its turn (it would have to move UP twice, which isn't possible in one turn).\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- **Priority:** Avoid immediate collisions with Snake #1. Moving UP is the safest option as it doesn't risk a head-on collision or Snake #1 moving into my path next turn.\n- **Apple Collection:** The apple at (2,7) is the most reachable, but I need to plan a path to it without getting trapped or colliding with Snake #1.\n- **Movement Plan:** Moving UP first allows me to explore the top-right quadrant without immediate threats. From (6,7), I can consider LEFT or RIGHT to start moving toward (2,7) or (3,9)/(2,9) while keeping options open.\n- **Avoid Dead-Ends:** Stay near the edges or open spaces to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Final Move:\nUP",

If I move RIGHT, we collide head-on and both die. Moving LEFT is safe and continues progress toward **(2, 7)**.\n   - Snake #1 could move LEFT to **(4, 7)** on its turn, but since it's at **(5, 7)**, it would need to move LEFT once to reach **(4, 7)**. Thus, moving LEFT to **(3, 7)** is safe from immediate collision.\n\n4. **Path to Apple (2, 7):**\n   - To reach **(2, 7)**, I need to continue moving LEFT to reduce the x-coordinate from 4 to 2.\n   - Moving LEFT to **(3, 7)** is the next step toward this goal.\n\n5. **Future Traps:**\n   - Moving UP or DOWN keeps me in the same column but doesn\u2019t progress toward the apple at **(2, 7)**.\n   - Moving RIGHT is dangerous due to collision with Snake #1.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- **Priority:** Move toward the closest apple at **(2, 7)** while avoiding collisions with Snake #1.\n- **Movement Plan:** Continue moving LEFT to **(3, 7)** to further reduce the x-coordinate. From there, continue moving LEFT to reach **(2, 7)** and collect the apple.\n- **Avoid Dead-Ends:** Stay flexible to adjust if Snake #1 moves unpredictably.\n\n### Final Move:\nLEFT",

This is the closest and highest priority.\n   - Moving LEFT to **(2, 7)** will collect this apple and grow my snake by 1 segment.\n\n3. **Enemy Position:**\n   - Snake #1 is at **(4, 7)**. If I move RIGHT, we collide head-on and both die. Moving LEFT to **(2, 7)** is safe from immediate collision.\n   - Snake #1 could move LEFT to **(3, 7)** on its turn, but since it's at **(4, 7)**, it would need to move LEFT twice to reach **(3, 7)**. Thus, moving LEFT to **(2, 7)** is safe from immediate collision.\n\n4. **Path to Apple (2, 7):**\n   - Moving LEFT to **(2, 7)** directly collects the apple. This is optimal for maximizing score.\n\n5. **Future Traps:**\n   - Moving UP or DOWN keeps me in the same column but doesn't progress toward the apple at **(2, 7)**.\n   - Moving RIGHT is dangerous due to collision with Snake #1.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- **Priority:** Collect the apple at **(2, 7)** since it is the closest and most accessible.\n- **Movement Plan:** Move LEFT to **(2, 7)** to collect the apple and gain 1 point.\n- **Avoid Dead-Ends:** After collecting the apple, I will have a new tail at **(3, 7)**. I need to ensure that future moves do not trap me or lead to collisions with Snake #1.\n\n### Final Move:\nLEFT",
