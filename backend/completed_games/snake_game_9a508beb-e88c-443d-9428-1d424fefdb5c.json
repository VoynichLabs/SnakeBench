I should stay closer to the bottom-left for safer movement.\n\n#### Strategy for Next Move:\n\n1. **Eat the closest apple** at (0, 1) by continuing to move downward and then left. Growing to 2+ body pieces will provide more control over the board\u2019s central apples in upcoming turns.\n2. **Avoid collisions** with other snakes and walls. I can\u2019t move right or up since **Snake #0** is above me, and going up could lead to a wall or collision.\n3. **Maintain mobility** by not boxing myself in. I\u2019ll prioritize moves that allow several options in the next turn.\n\n### Decision for This Turn:\n\n1. **DOWN** moves me closer to (0, 1), setting up for eating the closest apple.\n2. **(LEFT) will be my next move in the following turn** to actually reach the apple.\n\n**Next Move:** **DOWN**",

Wait - no, the apple list doesn't show one at (3,6))\n- Wait, examining board state: \n  - My head was at (3,7) before the move too - this seems inconsistent with last move being RIGHT\n  - Maybe the board already reflected the RIGHT move to (3,7)?\n- Apples remain at: (7,8), (9,3), (9,8), (5,6), (0,1)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Closest apple is still (5,6) - 2 spaces right and 1 down from (3,7)\n- Next apple is (0,1) - 3 left and 6 down (further away)\n- Snake #1 is at (0,4)-(0,5) - moving left, no immediate threat\n\n**Available Moves:**\n1) RIGHT: to (4,7) - heads toward (5,6) apple\n2) DOWN: to (3,6) - also moves toward (5,6) but less directly\n3) UP: to (3,8) - away from apples\n4) LEFT: to (2,7) - away from apples\n\n**Danger Evaluation:**\n- All adjacent squares are safe (no snakes, no walls)\n- Snake #1 is moving left - will likely continue toward (0,3) next turn\n\n**Optimal Path:**\nThe fastest way to (5,6) is RIGHT then DOWN (total 2 moves)\nAlternative is DOWN then RIGHT (same distance)\n\n**Strategy:** \n- Since RIGHT then DOWN is equally good as DOWN then RIGHT, but RIGHT first maintains more options\n- Want to keep distance from Snake #1 which is moving toward left wall\n\n**Decision:** \nRIGHT first (to (4,7)) then DOWN to (4,6) next turn to reach apple at (5,6)\n\nNEXT MOVE: RIGHT \n\n**Future Consideration:** After eating (5,6), aim for (7,8) or (0,1) depending on Snake #1's position. (0,1) may become dangerous if Snake #1 moves down.\n\nRIGHT",
