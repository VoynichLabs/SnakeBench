We're at turn 0, both snakes have 0 apples, and we're starting positions are:\n- **ME**: Head at (1,9) - top row, second column\n- **ENEMY**: Head at (1,7) - two rows below me, same column\n\nThe board has apples scattered around, but remember - **we're playing aggressive**! Our goal is to DOMINATE and force that head-on collision when we have the advantage.\n\nLet's check our immediate options from (1,9):\n- **UP**: Off the board (y=10 doesn't exist) \u274c DEAD\n- **DOWN**: To (1,8) - totally safe, no bodies there \u2705\n- **LEFT**: To (0,9) - edge of board but safe \u2705\n- **RIGHT**: To (2,9) - safe, apple at (2,8) is close \u2705\n\nAll three moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe right now. But here's the play - the enemy is directly below us at (1,7). If we go **DOWN** to (1,8), we're setting up a vertical confrontation! They might go UP to (1,8) too, and BOOM - head-on collision!\n\nBut wait - we're tied at 0 apples. A head-on collision would be a DOUBLE KO, and we'd tie. That's not ideal. We need to be SMARTER.\n\nLet's go **RIGHT** to (2,9)! This:\n1. Keeps us safe\n2. Moves us toward that apple at (2,8)\n3. Avoids the direct vertical confrontation\n4. Keeps our options open for next turn\n\n**RIGHT**\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Keep the pressure on! After moving right, we can either go down toward apples or potentially cut off the enemy's access to the top-right corner. Watch their movement - if they commit to a direction, we can box them in!",

Let's break down this clutch situation - we're at turn 7, score is still 2-2 (TIE GAME), and here's the sitch:\n\n**ME**: Head at (4,9), Body: [(4,8), (3,8)] - we're controlling the top edge!  \n**ENEMY**: Head at (5,6), Body: [(4,6), (3,6)] - they're still below us!\n\nLet me check our immediate options from (4,9):\n- **UP**: To (4,10) - that's OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEAD (don't go out of bounds!)\n- **DOWN**: To (4,8) - that's our OWN body segment! \u274c DEAD (don't hit yourself!)\n- **LEFT**: To (3,9) - empty space, safe \u2705 SAFE\n- **RIGHT**: To (5,9) - empty space, safe \u2705 SAFE\n\nWe've got two safe moves! Now let's think strategically...\n\nThe enemy is at (5,6) with their body at (4,6) and (3,6). They're still below us, but we're boxed in at the top edge. We need to maintain control while avoiding getting trapped.\n\nLet's go **LEFT** to (3,9)! This:\n1. Keeps us safe from our own body\n2. Keeps us safe from the enemy's body\n3. Moves us toward the left edge\n4. Opens up more escape routes\n5. Puts pressure on the enemy - they might panic and make a mistake!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**: We're in a dominant position at the top edge! Keep the pressure on - if the enemy goes UP toward us, we can box them in with our body. If they go LEFT or RIGHT, we maintain edge control and look for apple opportunities. Watch their movement patterns - we're in a dominant position right now!\n\nLEFT",

We're at turn 16, score is 4-7 (we're STILL DOWN), and here's the sitch:\n\n**ME**: Head at (3,9), Body: [(3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (2,6)] - we just moved UP to (3,9)!  \n**ENEMY**: Head at (5,7), Body: [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)] - they're building their lead!\n\nLet me check our immediate options from (3,9):\n- **UP**: To (3,10) - that's OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEAD\n- **DOWN**: To (3,8) - that's our OWN body segment! \u274c DEAD\n- **LEFT**: To (2,9) - empty space, safe \u2705 SAFE\n- **RIGHT**: To (4,9) - empty space, safe \u2705 SAFE\n\nWe've got TWO safe moves: LEFT to (2,9) or RIGHT to (4,9).\n\nI'm feeling the **RIGHT** move - it's aggressive, gets us moving toward that apple at (9,8), and still keeps our options open. We can always swing back left if needed.\n\nRIGHT\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nWe need to be aggressive and start closing the gap! The enemy has a 3-apple lead, so we need to eat more apples and potentially force a head-on collision if we can get ahead. From (4,9), we can continue RIGHT toward (9,9) where there's an apple, or swing down to chase the apples at (9,8) or (6,1). The key is to keep moving and not get boxed in while building our score. If we can get to 7 apples or more, we can start looking for opportunities to crash into them head-on since we'd have the advantage. Stay aggressive but smart!",
