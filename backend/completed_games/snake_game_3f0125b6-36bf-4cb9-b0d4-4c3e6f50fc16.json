It also keeps multiple escape options afterward (we can go DOWN or LEFT later to head toward the bottom-left apple cluster).\n- UP or DOWN are safe but slower to the nearest apple and give the opponent more time to approach the left side apples.

There's no nearby enemy head threat (enemy head at (1,9) is far left), so no realistic head-on collision risk this turn. Eating now increases my score (closing the gap) and gives me extra length to contest the nearby apple cluster at (4,6) and (4,9).\n- UP (6,7) is safe and keeps mobility, but it delays getting the nearby apples and concedes them to potential opponents.\n- RIGHT (7,6) could allow me to take (7,5) next turn, but that also delays grabbing the denser cluster to the left and moves me away from the immediate apples at (5,6)/(4,6).\n\nRisk check:\n- Taking LEFT does not run into any body segments or board edges and avoids backwards move rules.\n- After eating at (5,6), I still have multiple escape options (LEFT toward (4,6) apple, UP toward open space, or RIGHT back toward (6,6) if needed). That keeps me from getting boxed in by my own body.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- LEFT to eat (5,6) this turn.\n- Next turn aim LEFT to (4,6) to collect the adjacent apple, then reassess: likely move toward (4,9) or back to open space to avoid self-trapping while monitoring enemy positions.\n\nLEFT",

Risk: enemy #0 (head (2,8)) can contest that apple in ~3 moves too \u2014 possible dangerous head-on contest.\n- LEFT -> (3,6): safe, moves toward the nearby apple at (3,5) in 1 more move. Keeps multiple escape options (UP/LEFT/DOWN).\n- DOWN -> (4,5): safe, also allows grabbing (3,5) next turn.\n- RIGHT -> (5,6): illegal (into my neck / immediate death).\n\nElimination: RIGHT is forbidden.\n\nChoice reasoning:\n- Avoid UP because (4,9) is contested by enemy #0; racing them risks a head-on collision for the 4,9 apple (both reach in ~3 moves).\n- LEFT and DOWN both let me get the nearby apple at (3,5) in two moves. Between them I prefer LEFT to (3,6): it keeps more lateral room and avoids staying on the x=4 column (so I don\u2019t get locked into a direct race with the opponent for (4,9)). From (3,6) I have safe follow-ups: DOWN to eat (3,5), UP to gain height, or LEFT to continue toward open space. That keeps flexibility and reduces head-on risk.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- This turn: move LEFT to (3,6).\n- Next turn: take (3,5) by moving DOWN (unless an opponent moves to contest it; then reassess).\n- After getting (3,5), evaluate: prefer going for (7,5) if safe (more apples on board), otherwise pivot toward (4,9) only if uncontested; keep avoiding head-on races with snake #0 and maintain open space around my head.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT: (2, 6) - my body, would kill me (backwards move)\n\nUnsafe moves:\n- LEFT would move into my own body (backwards)\n- RIGHT would move into my own body (backwards)\n\nSafe moves:\n- UP to (1,7) - apple\n- DOWN to (1,5)\n\nEvaluating the safe moves:\n1. UP to (1,7):\n   - Moves me to an apple, gaining a point\n   - Next turn I could continue up toward (1,8) or left toward (0,7)\n   - Puts me closer to the apple at (1,1)\n   - However, moving to (1,7) puts me closer to the edge and might limit future options\n\n2. DOWN to (1,5):\n   - Moves me toward the center of the board\n   - Next turn I could continue down toward (1,4) or right toward (2,5)\n   - Puts me closer to the apples at (1,1) and (7,5)\n   - Keeps multiple future options open\n   - However, moving to (1,5) doesn't give me an immediate apple\n\nConsidering the enemy snake's position and potential moves:\n- Enemy snake is currently at (4,5) with body extending to (6,1)\n- They might move toward the apples at (1,7), (4,9), or (7,5)\n- If I move UP to (1,7), I'm moving toward the edge with fewer options but also gaining an apple\n- If I move DOWN to (1,5), I'm moving toward the center where there are more apples and keeping more options open\n\nBest move:\nUP to (1,7) is the best move as it allows me to gain an apple immediately while keeping me away from the enemy snake. It also puts me in a position to potentially move toward the apple at (1,1) in the next turn.\n\nUP",

From (4,4) evaluate reachable apples: consider going west/south toward (1,1) if (7,5) remains blocked by my body; if my body shifts to free a path to (7,5) later, re-approach that apple cluster.

UP: (1, 8) - my body, would kill me\n2. DOWN: (1, 6) - my body, would kill me (backwards move)\n3. LEFT: (0, 7) - my body, would kill me\n4. RIGHT: (2, 7) - my body, would kill me\n\nWait, this seems problematic. Let me re-examine the board state and my snake's position.\n\nLooking at the board representation:\n```\n 9 . T T . A . . . . .\n 8 T T T . . . . . . .\n 7 T 0 T . . . . . . .\n 6 T T T T T T T . . .\n 5 . . . T T . T A . .\n 4 . . . . 1 . T . . A\n 3 . . . . . . T . . .\n 2 . . . . . . T . . .\n 1 . A . . . . . . . .\n 0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy snake's head is at (1,7) which is marked as '0' on the board. The body is:\n(1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)\n\nLooking at the board:\n- (1,7) is my head (0)\n- (1,8) is my body (T)\n- (1,6) is my body (T)\n- (0,7) is my body (T)\n- (2,7) is my body (T)\n\nThis means all four directions would move into my own body, which would kill me. This seems like a dead-end situation.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the coordinates:\n- UP from (1,7) would be (1,8) - which is my body\n- DOWN from (1,7) would be (1,6) - which is my body\n- LEFT from (1,7) would be (0,7) - which is my body\n- RIGHT from (1,7) would be (2,7) - which is my body\n\nThis appears to be a complete trap with no safe moves available. According to the rules, if I have no safe moves, I will die this turn.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any possible safe move I'm missing. The board shows:\n- At (1,7): my head (0)\n- At (1,8): T (my body)\n- At (1,6): T (my body)\n- At (0,7): T (my body)\n- At (2,7): T (my body)\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied by my own body. There are no safe moves available.\n\nAccording to the rules, if I have no safe moves, I will die this turn. However, I must still provide a move. In this case, any move I choose will result in my death.\n\nGiven that all moves are equally deadly, I'll choose one arbitrarily. Since the last move was UP, I'll choose a different direction to avoid potential issues with the game engine.\n\nDOWN",

From there UP would be back into my neck, but LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN are all free (3 safe follow-ups).\n\nSafety and strategy:\n- No enemy head is adjacent, so head-on risk this turn is low.\n- The apple at (7,5) is currently blocked by my own body around column 6, so trying to rush right is likely to get me funneled.\n- Moving left slowly heads toward the lower-left apple cluster (1,1)/(0,0) but gives fewer immediate escape routes than going down.\n- The priority is to keep as many escape options open while moving into relatively open space.\n\nShort plan for next few turns:\n- Move into open space and avoid being funneled by my own body. From (4,3) evaluate paths toward the (1,1)/(0,0) cluster while keeping at least two exit options each turn.
