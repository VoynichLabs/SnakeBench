My goal is to move towards this apple.\nMy current position is (4, 8). The target is (4, 6).\nTo reach (4, 6) from (4, 8), I need to decrease my y-coordinate from 8 to 6, while keeping the x-coordinate at 4.\n\nPossible moves from (4, 8):\n- UP to (4, 9): This moves away from the target (y=6). It is safe. Distance to (4,6) = 3.\n- DOWN to (4, 7): This moves towards the target (y=6). It is safe from walls (0 <= 4 <= 9, 0 <= 7 <= 9). My body is empty, so no self-collision. Enemy snake 1 is at (7, 7) with body at (7, 8); neither (7,7) nor (7,8) is (4,7), so no collision with the enemy. Distance to (4,6) = 1.\n- LEFT to (3, 8): This moves away from the target x-coordinate (x=4). It is safe. Distance to (4,6) = 3.\n- RIGHT to (5, 8): This moves away from the target x-coordinate (x=4). It is safe. Distance to (4,6) = 3.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4, 7) is the only move that reduces the distance to the closest apple (4, 6). It is also a safe move. This aligns with the strategy mentioned in the last move's rationale: from (4, 8), move DOWN to get closer to y=6.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My position will be (4, 7). The closest apple is at (4, 6), just one step away. The next move should be DOWN to eat the apple, provided it is still there and the spot is safe.\n\nDOWN"

Safe.\n\nSafe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's identify the closest apples from my current head (4, 8):\n- (6, 7): Manhattan distance = |6-4| + |7-8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (7, 8): Manhattan distance = |7-4| + |8-8| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (7, 9): Manhattan distance = |7-4| + |9-8| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- (9, 8): Manhattan distance = |9-4| + |8-8| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- (1, 1): Manhattan distance = |1-4| + |1-8| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nThe closest apples are at (6, 7) and (7, 8), both at a distance of 3.\n\nLet's see which safe move brings me closer to these closest apples and other nearby ones:\n- Move UP to (4, 9):\n    - Distance to (6, 7): |6-4| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4 (further)\n    - Distance to (7, 8): |7-4| + |8-9| = 3 + 1 = 4 (further)\n    - Distance to (7, 9): |7-4| + |9-9| = 3 + 0 = 3 (closer)\n    - Distance to (9, 8): |9-4| + |8-9| = 5 + 1 = 6 (further)\n- Move DOWN to (4, 7):\n    - Distance to (6, 7): |6-4| + |7-7| = 2 + 0 = 2 (closer)\n    - Distance to (7, 8): |7-4| + |8-7| = 3 + 1 = 4 (further)\n    - Distance to (7, 9): |7-4| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 (further)\n    - Distance to (9, 8): |9-4| + |8-7| = 5 + 1 = 6 (further)\n- Move RIGHT to (5, 8):\n    - Distance to (6, 7): |6-5| + |7-8| = 1 + 1 = 2 (closer)\n    - Distance to (7, 8): |7-5| + |8-8| = 2 + 0 = 2 (closer)\n    - Distance to (7, 9): |7-5| + |9-8| = 2 + 1 = 3 (closer)\n    - Distance to (9, 8): |9-5| + |8-8| = 4 + 0 = 4 (closer)\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 8) is the only safe move that reduces the Manhattan distance to both of the two closest apples ((6, 7) and (7, 8)). It also reduces the distance to the next two closest apples ((7, 9) and (9, 8)). Moving DOWN reduces distance to only one of the closest apples ((6, 7)) but increases distance to the other ((7, 8)) and the next two closest. Moving UP reduces distance only to the third closest apple ((7, 9)) but increases distance to the two closest and the fourth closest.\n\nThe enemy snake at (5, 5) is not in a position to block the move to (5, 8) this turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the best option among the safe moves to approach the closest food sources simultaneously.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (5, 8), my head will be at (5, 8). My body will be [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]. From (5, 8), I will evaluate safe moves, continuing to prioritize approaching the closest apples ((6, 7) and (7, 8) are likely still the closest) while being aware that I am in the same column as the enemy snake's head (5, 5) and need to consider its potential movements.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

          "rationale": "My current head is at (6, 8) and my body is at [(5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)].\nApples are at (9, 8), (7, 9), (1, 1), (6, 7), (7, 8).\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (6, 6) with body [(6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)].\nThe board is 10x10.\n\nLet's evaluate the safety of possible moves from (6, 8):\n- UP to (6, 9): Within bounds, not on my body [(5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)], not on enemy snake (head (6, 6), body [(6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)]). Safe.\n- DOWN to (6, 7): Within bounds, not on my body, not on enemy snake. (6, 7) is an apple location. Safe.\n- LEFT to (5, 8): Within bounds, occupied by my body segment (5, 8). Unsafe (Self-collision).\n- RIGHT to (7, 8): Within bounds, not on my body, not on enemy snake. (7, 8) is an apple location. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's identify the closest apples from my current head (6, 8):\n- (6, 7): Manhattan distance = |6-6| + |7-8| = 0 + 1 = 1\n- (7, 8): Manhattan distance = |7-6| + |8-8| = 1 + 0 = 1\n- (7, 9): Manhattan distance = |7-6| + |9-8| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- (9, 8): Manhattan distance = |9-6| + |8-8| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (1, 1): Manhattan distance = |1-6| + |1-8| = 5 + 7 = 12\n\nThe closest apples are at (6, 7) and (7, 8), both at a distance of 1. Both of these locations are safe moves and result in eating an apple this turn.\n\nChoosing between moving DOWN to (6, 7) and RIGHT to (7, 8):\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 7) results in eating the apple at (6, 7). My head would then be at (6, 7), adjacent to the enemy head at (6, 6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 8) results in eating the apple at (7, 8). My head would then be at (7, 8), not adjacent to the enemy head at (6, 6). This position is also adjacent to another apple at (7, 9).\n\nBoth moves achieve the goal of eating an apple this turn. However, moving RIGHT to (7, 8) positions me further away from the enemy snake's head and places me adjacent to another apple at (7, 9), offering a potential target for the next turn. This seems strategically better than moving adjacent to the enemy head.\n\nThe enemy snake at (6, 6) can potentially move to (6, 7) (if I don't go there), (5, 6), or (7, 6). Moving to (7, 8) keeps me safer from immediate interaction with the enemy compared to moving to (6, 7).\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is the preferred move to eat an apple while maintaining a better position relative to the enemy snake and the next closest apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (7, 8), my head will be at (7, 8) and my body will be [(6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8)]. I will have eaten the apple, so my tail remains at (2, 8). The apple at (7, 9) will be immediately UP from my head. I will check the safety of moving UP to (7, 9) (checking for walls, my expanded body, and the enemy's new position/body). If safe, moving UP to eat the apple at (7, 9) will be the priority. If not, I will evaluate other safe moves (e.g., DOWN to (7, 7), RIGHT to (8, 8)) based on safety and proximity to other apples.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

My body is at [(7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8)].\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (7, 6).\nApples are at (9, 8), (1, 1), (4, 7), (9, 2), (0, 7).\n\nLet's evaluate possible moves from my current head position (8, 9):\n- UP to (8, 10): This is outside the board boundaries (Y=10). Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (8, 8): This position is within bounds. It is not occupied by my body segments [(7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8)]. It is not occupied by the enemy snake's body or head. Safe.\n- LEFT to (7, 9): This position is currently occupied by my body (my neck segment). Unsafe (Self-collision).\n- RIGHT to (9, 9): This position is within bounds. It is not occupied by my body segments. It is not occupied by the enemy snake's body or head. Safe.\n\nMy safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT. Neither move lands me on an apple this turn. I need to choose a move that positions me well for the next turn, ideally moving towards an apple while remaining safe and maintaining future options.\n\nThe closest apple is at (9, 8).\n- Moving DOWN to (8, 8): Distance to (9, 8) from (8, 8) is |9-8| + |8-8| = 1 + 0 = 1. This moves me adjacent to the apple.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 9): Distance to (9, 8) from (9, 9) is |9-9| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1. This also moves me adjacent to the apple.\n\nBoth safe moves put me one step away from the apple at (9, 8). Let's consider the positioning for the turn after.\n- If I move DOWN to (8, 8), my head will be at (8, 8). Safe moves from (8, 8) (avoiding my new body and walls) include DOWN to (8, 7) and RIGHT to (9, 8) (the apple). This gives me two options besides getting the apple next turn (though getting the apple is priority).\n- If I move RIGHT to (9, 9), my head will be at (9, 9). Safe moves from (9, 9) (avoiding my new body, walls) include DOWN to (9, 8) (the apple). Moving LEFT to (8,9) would hit my body. Moving UP/RIGHT is out of bounds. This gives me only one safe option (getting the apple) besides certain death.\n\nConsidering the enemy at (7, 6), its likely safe moves are DOWN to (7,5) or RIGHT to (8,6). Neither of these positions will block my path to the apple at (9,8) from either (8,8) or (9,9) on the next turn, and neither creates an immediate collision threat this turn or next turn.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT moves are safe and lead directly to reaching the closest apple (9,8) on the next turn. However, moving DOWN to (8,8) leaves me in a position with more potential safe moves (DOWN or RIGHT) on the subsequent turn compared to moving RIGHT to (9,9) which primarily leaves only DOWN as a safe move to the apple. Maintaining flexibility is generally advantageous.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the preferred move as it offers better future positioning while still ensuring I can reach the apple at (9,8) on the next turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (8, 8), my head will be at (8, 8). I will check safe moves again based on the updated board, but the primary goal will be to move RIGHT to (9, 8) to consume the apple. If the apple is somehow unavailable or unsafe, I will evaluate moving DOWN to (8, 7) as an alternative safe move.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

I will evaluate safe moves from (9, 9), which will likely include moving LEFT towards the apple at (6, 9), while avoiding self-collision (especially with my neck at (9, 8)), wall collision, and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

Unsafe (Wall).\n- DOWN to (9, 8): This position is occupied by my neck (the first segment in my body list).
