This will give me 7 apples total. I should maintain distance from the enemy while efficiently collecting apples. The enemy is at (6, 3) and I'll be at (1, 7) after this move, so there's plenty of distance between us.

It takes me toward the right-side apples at (8, 9), (8, 2), and (7, 0) and gives me more room to maneuver away from my concentrated body on the left side.\n\n## Long-term Plan\nI should continue moving right to get clear of my body on the left side. After clearing the right-side apples, I can work my way down and then left to collect the apples at (0, 5) and (0, 6) after my body has moved away. The key is to maintain my 6-0 apple lead by efficiently collecting apples while avoiding dangerous positions.\n\nRIGHT",

This move:\n- Keeps me safe\n- Moves me closer to the closest apples at (0, 5) and (0, 6)\n- Continues the path away from my body\n- Provides better positioning for future moves toward the apples\n- Allows me to escape the U-shape more efficiently\n- Aligns me horizontally with the left-side apples\n\nLEFT",
