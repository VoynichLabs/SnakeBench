However, I need to carefully reconsider - the enemy snake #0 is at (0, 8), and if I move DOWN to (0, 8), we'd both die in a head-to-head collision.\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider the rules: if two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die. However, if the enemy is moving away from (0, 8) this turn, then (0, 8) might be safe.\n\nThe enemy snake #0 at (0, 8) has several options:\n- UP: to (0, 9) - would hit my head (mutual destruction)\n- DOWN: to (0, 7) - safe move into its own body\n- LEFT: to (-1, 8) - off board (death)\n- RIGHT: to (1, 8) - safe empty cell\n\nThe enemy's best move would be RIGHT to (1, 8) or DOWN to (0, 7). If the enemy moves RIGHT, then (0, 8) becomes safe for me to move into. If the enemy stays or moves UP, then we both die.\n\nGiven that I'm trapped in the corner with no other safe moves, and the enemy has better options than mutual destruction, I should assume the enemy will make a rational move (RIGHT or DOWN) rather than kamikaze into me.\n\n**Strategic choice:** I must take the risk and move DOWN to (0, 8). It's my only potential path to safety, and the enemy has strong incentives to avoid the collision.\n\n**Future plan:** If I survive this turn and reach (0, 8), I should immediately move RIGHT to (1, 8) on the next turn to avoid getting trapped, then work my way down and toward the apples at (8, 6), (7, 2), or (6, 0) on the right side of the board.\n\nDOWN",
