Since I'm currently at (7, 0), I can move up (direction: UP), down (direction: DOWN), left (direction: LEFT), or right (direction: RIGHT).\n\nTo avoid colliding with the walls, I can't move up (since I'm already at the bottom row), left (since I'm at the leftmost column), or right (since I'm at the rightmost column minus one).\n\nTo avoid colliding with other snakes, I can't move towards snake #2, which is at (2, 8).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. I'm currently next to one at (7, 1), and there are others at (1, 7), (8, 7), and (5, 0). If I move up, I might be able to eat the apple at (7, 1) or (1, 7), but I would be closer to the apple at (7, 1). If I move down, I might be able to eat the apple at (5, 0), but it's further away. If I move left or right, I wouldn't be able to reach any apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to eat the apple at (7, 1) if possible, and avoid moving towards snake #2.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

Therefore, the best move is to move up towards the apple at (1, 7).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching the apple at (1, 7), I will reassess the board to determine the next best move, possibly targeting the apple at (2, 6) or (7, 4), depending on the position of the enemy snake and the overall board state.\n\nNext move: UP"
