No traps visible.\n- RIGHT: Continues east to (4,5), aligning with last plan for east-west momentum, but delays north progress slightly; from there, only UP would move north (left/right east/west mostly), restricting follow-ups somewhat compared to staying north early.\n- DOWN: Moves south to (3,4), closer to enemy (which could follow UP), potentially into southern apple territory\u2014riskier for head-on if enemy uses RIGHT/LEFT; also reduces options by taking me farther from northern targets and toward potential dead-ends if enemy contests south.\n\nPrioritizing: UP best advances north toward (8,8)/(8,9) without risk, maximizes future directions (can keep UPping, or pivot east/west freely), and outsources southern apples to enemy.\n\nLong-term plan: Stick to UP (or north-bonding moves) for 2-3 turns to reach y\u22656-7, then veer right onto x\u22654-5 to approach (8,8)/(8,9) apple cluster. Monitor enemy\u2014stay \u22651 space away vertically/horizontally; if it pressures north, consider looping east or circling south apples as back-up. Avoid committing south unless enemy vacates the area.\n\nUP",

DOWN/LEFT miss opportunities or increase distance to eatable apples. RIGHT maintains openness in row 8 (wide space east) and sets up for quick gains.\n- No obvious head-ons or dead-ends; enemy could mirror east (RIGHT from (5,5)), but midline space allows evasion.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Turns\nSecure right-side apples: Continue RIGHT (from (5,8)) to (6,8), then (7,8), then (8,8) to eat, grow by 1.

Key: (5,7) contested\u2014enemy can reach it this turn (UP eats if no collision), but (5,7) also adjacent my head DOWN. Clustered east apples ((8,8)/(8,9)) ~3-4 steps from current position; row 8-9 open for horizontal movement. Southern apples ((9,3)/(3,0)) distant (6+ steps).\n- Board: Column 5 contested; rows 7-9 relatively open east (x=6-8). No immediate dead-ends or bottlenecks; enemy in x=5 risks column traps if they pursue vertically.\n\n### Safe Moves Analysis\n- UP: To (5,9) \u2013 empty. Follow-ups: LEFT (4,9 empty), RIGHT (6,9 empty), DOWN (5,8 own future body? Wait: after move, new body at (5,8), so DOWN from (5,9) to (5,8) = own body, die. Only 2 safe: LEFT/RIGHT. Keeps path toward (8,9) apple via RIGHT, but limits maneuvering (e.g., DOWN becomes suicidal).\n- DOWN: To (5,7) \u2013 apple (eats and grows). Follow-ups: FROM GROWTH\u2014new body at (5,8), old (4,8) remains. New head (5,7): UP (5,8 own body die), DOWN (5,6 empty? Enemy might be there), LEFT (4,7 empty), RIGHT (6,7 empty). Only LEFT/RIGHT safe (2 options). BUT: Enemy head-on risk if they move UP to (5,7)\u2014collision kills both, game ends in draw (tied apples). Poor if enemy pursues.\n- LEFT: To (4,8) \u2013 own body, die.\n- RIGHT: To (6,8) \u2013 empty. Follow-ups: UP (6,9 empty), DOWN (6,7 empty), RIGHT (7,8 empty). Wide-open row 8-9 east toward (8,8)/(8,9); 3 options; directly advances on clustered apples while avoiding column 5 convergence. Avoids head-on risk entirely.\n\n### Decision Rationale\n- Eliminate dangerous: LEFT (own body, die). DOWN risky\u2014enemy moved UP last turn, may continue to (5,7) for apple, causing mutual (likely) death and draw. UP leaves only 2 follow-ups and rebounds toward own body soon. RIGHT safest with 3 options, advances east without conflict.\n- Favor RIGHT: Closer to high-value right apples ((8,8)/(8,9)), maintains openness in wide rows 8-9, avoids enemy pursuit/path interception. UP/DOWN close fewer/more distant apples or add risks. No auto head-ons detectable, but RIGHT evades likely column traps.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Turns\nSecure east apples: Continue RIGHT to (6,8) next? Wait, yes: PRIORITIZE. Proceed RIGHT/UP/RIGHT/etc. to (6,8) then (7,8)(8,8)(eat,grow), then (8,9)(eat). If enemy mirrors (e.g., RIGHT to (6,6)), swarm evade via y=9 or cut around south into low density. If they eat (5,7), pivot LEFT from potential (6,8) to (5,8 mark) reclaimed, then DOWN/LEFT for (3,0) or column safe return\u2014column 5 now too risky. Avoid y=7 post-growth to dodge if enemy downs. Aim for 2-3 apple jump; if enemy dies via bad move, win solo. Stay in upper rows for escape.\n\nRIGHT",

The board is mostly open in column 9 (rows 0-7 are clear below me, based on visual and no other obstacles), column 9 offers a safe downward path to southern apples at (7,0) and (3,0), plus mid-right apple at (9,3). However, the nearby apples in row 9 (5,9) and (8,9) are highly accessible but currently unguarded by the enemy snake, which is positioned lower at (8,7). Prioritizing safety: Moving LEFT is suicidal (into own body at (8,8)), RIGHT is off-board suicide. DOWN to (9,7) risks a head-on collision if the enemy simultaneously moves RIGHT\u2014their head at (8,7) could go to (9,7), leading to mutual death and a tied-score draw (both at 2 apples). This is avoidable, but DOWN narrows options and keeps me in proximity to the enemy, reducing buffer space. UP to (9,9) is safe (no immediate death, enemy would need multiple moves to threaten), keeps evasion open (can zig in row 9 or retreat down column 9), and positions for quick apple gains at (8,9) next turn, then potentially (5,9). Enemy is likely pursuing similar goals; avoiding traps or dead-ends, UP expands control over the upper board without ceding ground. Revised strategy: Secure nearby, low-risk apples first before descending for spaced-out southern ones.\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK AND RATIONALE**\nMove UP to (9,9), positioning for left turn to (8,9) to eat apple next turn, growing and gaining a point. From there, continue leftward to assess (5,9) while keeping downward retreat open if enemy pressure builds. Monitor enemy movement (currently in column 8, rows 6-7); if they ascend aggressively, pivot to column 9 descent for southern apples to avoid clashes. Avoid direct head-on zones like (9,7). This prioritizes safety, apple access, and optionality over rushing south prematurely.\n**END LAST MOVE PICK AND RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

My snake (ID 1) head at (7,9), body at (8,9), (9,9), (9,8). I've collected 3 apples, enemy #0 has 2. Enemy head at (9,7), body (9,6), (8,6). From last move, I shifted left from (8,9) to advance on row 9 toward (5,9), which is unguarded and allows horizontal progress without risks. Row 9 path left is clear: (6,9) empty, (5,9) apple.\n\n### Safe Moves Evaluation\n- UP: (7,10) off-board \u2192 suicide.\n- DOWN: (7,8) empty, no immediate collision; this deviates from row 9 but opens vertical options toward southern apples like (7,0) at (7,0) via column 7, avoiding potential enemy interference if they ascend left. Keeps multiple paths (down/left/right if safe).\n- LEFT: (6,9) empty, no collision; directly advances toward apple at (5,9) on row 9, aligns with last rationale's plan to collect it safely, maintains horizontal momentum with options to continue left or pivot later (e.g., down after eating). Enemy at (9,7) can only move left to (8,7) or up to (8,8) from there, both low-risk to me currently at y=9.\n- RIGHT: (8,9) my own body \u2192 suicide.\n\nDOWN and LEFT are both safe. LEFT keeps commitment to eating (5,9) quickly for growth/score lead; DOWN explores vertical but risks losing horizontal progress and could trap against bottom edge. Enemy likely moving left, not upward threat yet. Prioritize immediate apple capture.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note\nStick to row 9 leftward to eat (5,9), growing to 4 segments (4 apples). Post-eat at (5,9), descend column 5 or pivot down column 6-7 toward southern apples (3,0) and (7,0) for easy points, building lead over enemy. Watch enemy path\u2014if they ascend left to column 8, avoid overlapping; fallback to looping back via column 9 for (9,3) if southern apples contested. Aim for 50 apples or survivor win.\n\nLEFT",

Avoid enemy ascending column 9; if they loop left to column 8, use southwest detour. Watch for traps near edges; aim for 50 apples, cut off enemy paths if possible.
