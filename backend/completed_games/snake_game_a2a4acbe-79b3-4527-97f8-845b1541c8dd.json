Very small and vulnerable.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head at (0, 3), no body segments. Directly left of your head (same y-coordinate, x=0 vs. x=6).\n- **Apples:** At (8,5), (4,9), (3,2), (1,2), (6,8).\n  - Closest apple to your head is (6,8) (directly above, distance 5 units).\n  - Next closest is (8,5) (diagonal, distance ~7 units).\n  - (3,2) and (1,2) are far but may be worth chasing if no immediate threats.\n\n**Immediate Threats:**\n- Enemy Snake #1 is at (0,3), which is **directly left** of your head (6,3). If Snake #1 moves **RIGHT**, it will collide with your head (6,3) on the next turn.\n- If you move **LEFT**, you will collide with Snake #1's head (since Snake #1 is at (0,3) and you're at (6,3), but Snake #1 will move first). Wait, no: **all snakes move simultaneously**, so if Snake #1 moves RIGHT, it will move to (1,3), and your head at (6,3) will not collide with it unless you also move RIGHT (but then you'd be moving away). Hmm, let's clarify:\n  - Snake #1 is at (0,3). If it moves **RIGHT**, it goes to (1,3).\n  - Your head is at (6,3). If you move **LEFT**, you go to (5,3).\n  - No collision occurs in this case because Snake #1 moves to (1,3) and you move to (5,3). They don't overlap.\n  - However, if Snake #1 moves **UP/DOWN/LEFT**, it may not threaten you directly, but we don't know its strategy.\n\n**Your Possible Moves:**\n1. **UP**: (6,3) \u2192 (6,4)\n   - Safe? Check if (6,4) is occupied by your body (no), Snake #1's body (no), or another snake's body (no). Safe.\n   - Distance to apples: (6,8) is 4 units up (y increases by 5 to reach it).\n2. **DOWN**: (6,3) \u2192 (6,2)\n   - Safe? Check (6,2): No body segments, no other snakes. Safe.\n   - Distance to apples: (3,2) is 3 units left (x decreases by 3), (1,2) is 5 units left.\n3. **LEFT**: (6,3) \u2192 (5,3)\n   - Safe? Check (5,3): No body segments, no other snakes. Safe.\n   - Distance to apples: (4,9) is far, (3,2) is 2 units down-left.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6,3) \u2192 (7,3)\n   - Safe? Check (7,3): No body segments, no other snakes. Safe.\n   - Distance to apples: (8,5) is 1 right, 2 up.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1's Possible Moves:**\n- Snake #1 is at (0,3). Its possible moves are:\n  1. **UP**: (0,3) \u2192 (0,4)\n  2. **DOWN**: (0,3) \u2192 (0,2)\n  3. **LEFT**: (0,3) \u2192 (-1,3) \u2192 **OUT OF BOARD (DEATH)** \u2192 Snake #1 would die if it moves LEFT.\n  4. **RIGHT**: (0,3) \u2192 (1,3)\n- Snake #1 is likely to avoid moving LEFT (death), so it will probably move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n**Potential Collisions:**\n- If Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to (1,3), and you move **LEFT** to (5,3), no collision.\n- If Snake #1 moves **UP/DOWN**, and you move **UP/DOWN**, no collision unless you both move into the same cell (unlikely given positions).\n- If Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to (1,3), and you move **RIGHT** to (7,3), no collision.\n- If Snake #1 moves **UP** to (0,4), and you move **UP** to (6,4), no collision.\n- If Snake #1 moves **DOWN** to (0,2), and you move **DOWN** to (6,2), no collision.\n\n**Apple Prioritization:**\n- Closest apple is (6,8) (directly above). Moving UP would get you closer to it.\n- Next is (8,5), which is reachable by moving RIGHT then UP.\n- (3,2) and (1,2) are far but may be worth chasing if no immediate threats.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Snake #1 is a direct threat if it moves RIGHT to (1,3) and you move LEFT to (5,3). But even then, no collision.\n- If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (1,3), and you move RIGHT to (7,3), you avoid it.\n- If Snake #1 moves UP/DOWN, you can safely move UP/DOWN without collision.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **UP** is the safest and most strategic:\n  - Moves you closer to the closest apple (6,8).\n  - Avoids potential future conflicts with Snake #1 if it moves RIGHT (since you're moving away from it vertically).\n  - Keeps you from getting trapped in a horizontal line with Snake #1.\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (for future self):**\n1. **Prioritize the apple at (6,8)** as it is the closest and easiest to reach.\n2. **Avoid Snake #1's path**: If Snake #1 starts moving RIGHT, you should move UP or DOWN to avoid potential future collisions.\n3. **Expand body segments**: Once you reach (6,8), grow your body to block Snake #1's movement or create a barrier.\n4. **Chase other apples**: After securing (6,8), target (8,5) or (3,2) depending on Snake #1's movements.\n5. **Watch for Snake #1's strategy**: If it starts moving UP/DOWN, you can mirror or counter accordingly.\n6. **Avoid dead-ends**: Always leave at least one safe exit direction to prevent getting trapped.\n\n---\n**Final Move:** UP",

Among these, RIGHT to (1,3) is favorable because it moves me closer to the apple at (1,2) while keeping multiple safe follow-up options (e.g., from (1,3), I can access UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn). This avoids staying on the edge of the board, reducing the risk of getting trapped.\n\n**Strategy note for next turns:** Continue prioritizing moves toward nearby apples like (1,2) or (3,2) while maintaining central positions to keep options open and monitor the enemy at (6,3) for potential conflicts.\n\nRIGHT",

Check `(6, 6)`: Empty (no snake body or apple).\n   - Distance to `(6, 8)`: 2 units up.\n2. **DOWN**: `(6, 5) \u2192 (6, 4)`\n   - Safe? Check `(6, 4)`: Empty.\n   - Distance to `(3, 2)`: Far.\n3. **LEFT**: `(6, 5) \u2192 (5, 5)`\n   - Safe? Check `(5, 5)`: **Apple!** (eat it and grow).\n   - Distance to `(6, 8)`: Still 3 units up after eating.\n4. **RIGHT**: `(6, 5) \u2192 (7, 5)`\n   - Safe? Check `(7, 5)`: Empty.\n   - Distance to `(8, 5)`: 1 unit right.\n\n#### **Apple Prioritization:**\n- The apple at `(5, 5)` is **adjacent** to your head. Eating it is the highest priority.\n- The apple at `(6, 8)` is closer than `(8, 5)` or `(3, 2)`, but `(5, 5)` is an immediate opportunity.\n\n#### **Risk Assessment:**\n- Snake #1 cannot move **UP**, so it cannot threaten you directly from above.\n- Moving **LEFT** to `(5, 5)` is the safest and most strategic:\n  - Eats an apple (grows your snake).\n  - Avoids potential future conflicts (Snake #1 cannot move into your path).\n  - Keeps you aligned toward `(6, 8)` after growth.\n\n#### **Potential Collisions:**\n- If Snake #1 moves **DOWN** to `(1, 1)` or **LEFT** to `(0, 2)`, no conflict with your move.\n- If Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to `(2, 2)`, no conflict with your move.\n\n#### **Long-Term Strategy:**\n1. **Eat the apple at `(5, 5)`** to grow and secure a body segment.\n2. **Target `(6, 8)` next** (closest remaining apple).\n3. **Avoid Snake #1's path**: Since Snake #1 cannot move **UP**, prioritize vertical movement to block its future moves.\n4. **Expand body segments** to create barriers or cut off Snake #1's escape routes.\n5. **Watch for Snake #1's apple**: It has 1 apple; if it grows, it becomes more aggressive.\n\n---\n**Final Move:** LEFT",

Neither of these poses an immediate threat to your current position.\n- Moving down to `(8, 5)` is the most efficient way to secure an apple and grow your snake.\n\n#### **Best Strategy:**\n- Collect the apple at `(8, 5)` immediately. This move is safe, efficient, and increases your score and snake length.\n- After collecting the apple, your new tail will be at `(7, 6)`, and your snake will be longer, making it harder for Snake #1 to threaten you.\n\n#### **Long-Term Plan:**\n1. Collect the apple at `(8, 5)` by moving down.\n2. After collecting the apple, consider moving left to `(7, 5)` to position yourself closer to the apple at `(6, 8)`.\n3. Avoid getting trapped by Snake #1 by keeping your options open and moving towards the next closest apple.\n\n---\n**DOWN**",
