RIGHT to (6, 8)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves away from the enemy at (7, 9).\n  - Keeps the snake flexible for future moves.\n  - Could potentially reach the apple at (6, 9) in the next turn if you move UP to (6, 9).\n- **Cons:**\n  - Doesn't collect an apple this turn.\n  - Less direct toward the apple at (6, 9) compared to moving UP.\n\n---\n\n### **Best Move: UP to (5, 9)**\n- **Why?**\n  - **Direct path to apple at (6, 9):** Moving UP to (5, 9) allows you to reach the apple at (6, 9) in the next turn.\n  - **Avoids enemy:** Moving away from the enemy at (7, 9) while positioning yourself to reach the apple.\n  - **Keeps flexibility:** Maintains options for future moves, such as moving RIGHT to (6, 9) next turn to collect the apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (for future self):**\n1. **Immediate Goal:** Move UP to (5, 9) to position yourself for the apple at (6, 9).\n2. **After Moving to (5, 9):**\n   - Next turn, consider moving RIGHT to (6, 9) to collect the apple.\n   - Watch the enemy's movements closely; it is currently at (7, 9) and might move down to (7, 8) or further.\n3. **Enemy Watch:**\n   - Enemy is at (7, 9). If it moves down, it could threaten your path to (6, 9) or other apples.\n   - Prioritize apples in less contested areas.\n4. **Future Strategy:**\n   - Focus on collecting apples while avoiding enemy.\n   - Try to corner enemy if possible to force it into a losing position.\n   - Prioritize apples that are closest or easiest to reach (e.g., (6, 9) is reachable and less contested).\n   - Avoid dead-ends and keep multiple safe follow-up moves available.\n\n---\n\n**Final Move:** UP",

It might move towards **(7, 1)** or **(6, 2)** next.\n- Avoid getting trapped in a corner or a tight space where the enemy could corner you.\n\n#### **Future Moves:**\n- **Turn 39:** Move **DOWN** to (8, 7) to position yourself closer to the apple at (1, 7).\n- **Turn 40:** Move **DOWN** again to (8, 6) to continue approaching the apple at (1, 7).\n- **Turn 41:** Evaluate the next move towards the apple at (1, 7) or other remaining apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move:**\nDOWN\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan for Next Moves:**\n- **Turn 40:** Move **DOWN** to (8, 6) to continue positioning yourself closer to the apple at (1, 7).\n- **Turn 41:** Move **DOWN** to (8, 5) to approach the apple at (1, 7).\n- **General Strategy:** Focus on collecting the apple at (1, 7) while maintaining flexibility to avoid enemy threats.

Moving **LEFT** to (5, 6) will help you approach it.\n- The apple at **(1, 7)** is farther away but might be reachable if you move towards the top-left corner.\n\n#### **Enemy Watch:**\n- Enemy Snake (ID 1) is currently at **(6, 5)** and seems to be moving upwards. It might move towards **(5, 5)** or **(6, 6)** next.\n- Avoid getting trapped in a tight space where the enemy could corner you.\n\n#### **Future Moves:**\n- **Turn 43:** Move **LEFT** to (5, 6) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 44:** Move **DOWN** to (5, 5) to continue towards the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 45:** Move **LEFT** to (4, 5) to approach the apple at (1, 5) if necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move:**\nLEFT\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan for Next Moves:**\n- **Turn 44:** Move **DOWN** to (5, 5) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 45:** Move **LEFT** to (4, 5) to continue towards the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 46:** Move **DOWN** to (4, 4) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **General Strategy:** Focus on collecting the apple at (1, 0) while maintaining flexibility to avoid enemy threats. Keep an eye on the apple at (1, 5) for future collection.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT to (3, 7)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - **Safe move.**\n  - **Avoids immediate collision with enemy or self.**\n  - **Could lead towards the apple at (1, 0) if you move DOWN next.**\n\n- **Cons:**\n  - **No immediate apple collection.**\n  - **Less efficient path to (1, 0) compared to moving DOWN first.**\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy**\n\n#### **Apple Prioritization:**\n- The apple at **(1, 0)** is the most accessible and beneficial move right now.\n- Collecting it will increase your score and lengthen your snake, making you harder to kill.\n- After collecting **(1, 0)**, focus on the apple at **(0, 0)**.\n\n#### **Enemy Watch:**\n- Enemy Snake (ID 1) is at **(0, 4)** and may move towards **(0, 3)** or **(1, 4)** next.\n- Avoid getting trapped in a tight space where the enemy could corner you.\n\n#### **Future Moves:**\n- **Turn 50:** Move **RIGHT** to (3, 7) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 51:** Move **DOWN** to (3, 6) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 52:** Move **LEFT** to (2, 6) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 53:** Move **DOWN** to (2, 5) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 54:** Move **LEFT** to (1, 5) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 55:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 4) to collect the apple at (1, 0).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move:**\nDOWN\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan for Next Moves:**\n- **Turn 51:** Move **DOWN** to (3, 6) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 52:** Move **LEFT** to (2, 6) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 53:** Move **DOWN** to (2, 5) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 54:** Move **LEFT** to (1, 5) to approach the apple at (1, 0).\n- **Turn 55:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 4) to collect the apple at (1, 0).\n- **General Strategy:** Focus on collecting the apple at (1, 0) first, then prioritize (0, 0) while avoiding enemy threats. Keep an eye on the apple at (8, 0) for future collection.\n\nDOWN",
