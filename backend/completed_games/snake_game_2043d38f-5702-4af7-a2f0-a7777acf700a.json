Possible moves:\n1. **UP**: (1,9) \u2192 Off the board (y=9 is invalid). **Invalid.**\n2. **DOWN**: (1,7) \u2192 Safe (no snake body or enemy here).\n3. **LEFT**: (0,8) \u2192 Safe (no snake body or enemy here).\n4. **RIGHT**: (2,8) \u2192 Safe (no snake body or enemy here).\n\n**Eliminated moves:** UP (off-board).\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)**\n\n#### **1. Move DOWN to (1,7)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves away from the edge (less risk of future collisions).\n  - Doesn\u2019t immediately threaten the enemy (enemy is at (0,5), far away).\n  - Opens up space below for future growth if you eat apples.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Doesn\u2019t directly lead to an apple (closest apple is at (6,8), which is to the right).\n  - If you move down now, you\u2019ll need to turn right to reach (6,8), but that might leave you vulnerable to the enemy if they move unpredictably.\n\n#### **2. Move LEFT to (0,8)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves closer to the enemy\u2019s current position (0,5), but not directly threatening.\n  - Could set up a path to (0,4) or (0,6) if you want to block the enemy.\n- **Cons:**\n  - If the enemy moves right from (0,5) to (1,5), they could eventually threaten your left side.\n  - Doesn\u2019t directly help you reach any apples.\n\n#### **3. Move RIGHT to (2,8)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Directly adjacent to the apple at (6,8). If you keep moving right, you can reach it in 4 moves (assuming no obstacles).\n  - Minimizes exposure to the enemy (enemy is at (0,5), far from this path).\n  - Growing rightward could create a barrier against the enemy if they try to move up.\n- **Cons:**\n  - If you move right and the enemy moves up to (0,6), they could eventually threaten your right side.\n  - Requires careful path planning to avoid getting trapped.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy**\n- **Prioritize apple at (6,8):** It\u2019s the closest apple and can be reached efficiently by moving right.\n- **Avoid the enemy\u2019s path:** The enemy is at (0,5). If they move up to (0,6), they could threaten your right side later. Moving right now gives you space to grow and block their potential upward movement.\n- **Grow your snake:** Since you\u2019re currently length 1, growing rightward will help you dominate space and create barriers.\n- **Watch for enemy moves:** The enemy is also length 1, so they\u2019re likely to move toward apples or space. If they move toward (4,5) or (6,2), you can adjust accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **Move Selection**\nThe best immediate move is **RIGHT** because:\n1. It\u2019s safe (no collisions).\n2. It moves you toward the closest apple at (6,8).\n3. It expands your snake\u2019s reach and creates a barrier against the enemy\u2019s potential upward movement.\n\n---\n\n**RIGHT**",

Moves away from the closest apple (4,5) but could be part of a path to other apples.\n2. **DOWN (to (0,4))**: Safe.

Moves directly toward the closest apple at (4,5). However, the enemy snake is at (1,8), so moving right could potentially lead to a future collision if the enemy moves down.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Moving RIGHT is the most direct path to the closest apple (4,5).\n- Moving UP or DOWN are safe but less optimal for immediate apple collection.\n- LEFT is invalid.\n\n**Potential Risks:**\n- If I move RIGHT to (1,5), and the enemy snake moves DOWN to (1,7), there's no immediate collision, but we need to monitor future moves.\n- The enemy snake is currently not blocking any immediate paths to apples.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best move is RIGHT, as it moves directly toward the closest apple (4,5) and keeps future options open. It's safe and aligns with the objective of collecting apples.\n\nRIGHT",

The right side is safer for growth since the enemy is on the left.\n2. **Monitor enemy movements** \u2013 Snake #1 is at (6,2) with body at (5,2), (4,2). They could move UP to (6,3) or RIGHT to (7,2). If they move UP, they might threaten the (6,6) apple. If they move RIGHT, they could block my path to (8,4) or (9,4).\n3. **Prioritize apple collection** \u2013 The next highest-priority apples are (9,4) and (6,6). (9,4) is reachable if I expand rightward, while (6,6) is more central but may require blocking the enemy first.\n4. **Avoid cornering myself** \u2013 The board is small, so I need to maintain flexibility. Rightward growth is safer, but I\u2019ll occasionally pivot to block threats or secure apples.\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Next 3 Moves):**\n- **Move 1 (Current):** DOWN to (7,4) \u2013 Eat the apple and grow. Now I\u2019ll pivot to block enemy movement if they start expanding upward.\n- **Move 2:** RIGHT to (8,4) \u2013 Expand rightward while maintaining flexibility to block the enemy. This also moves me closer to the (9,4) apple.\n- **Move 3:** RIGHT to (9,4) \u2013 Eat the apple and grow, securing the right edge. Now I\u2019ll pivot to block the enemy\u2019s leftward expansion or secure the (6,6) apple if safe.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- If the enemy moves UP to (6,3), I\u2019ll need to ensure I don\u2019t get trapped by moving too far right. I\u2019ll keep an eye on their position and adjust if they start threatening my tail.\n- If they move RIGHT to (7,2), I\u2019ll block by growing downward or leftward to cut off their path to (6,6).\n\n---\n\n### **Current Turn Analysis:**\n- **Head at (7,8)**, last move was RIGHT (from (6,8) to (7,8)).\n- **Apples:** (7,4) is the highest-priority target, reachable in 1 move (DOWN to (7,4)).\n- **Enemy:** At (6,2) with body at (5,2), (4,2). They could move UP to (6,3) or RIGHT to (7,2). If they move UP, they might threaten the (6,6) apple. If they move RIGHT, they could block my path to (8,4) or (9,4).\n\n**Safe Moves from (7,8):**\n1. **UP**: (7,9) \u2192 Off-board. **Invalid.**\n2. **DOWN**: (7,7) \u2192 Safe but doesn\u2019t help reach the apple. Could be useful for blocking the enemy later, but not urgent.\n3. **LEFT**: (6,8) \u2192 Safe but backtracking. Not ideal unless necessary.\n4. **RIGHT**: (8,8) \u2192 Safe and moves me closer to the right edge, but doesn\u2019t help reach the apple.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n- **DOWN to (7,4):** **Best move.** It\u2019s safe, moves me directly to the (7,4) apple, and grows my snake. This is the highest-priority target.\n- **RIGHT to (8,8):** Safe but doesn\u2019t help reach the apple. Could be useful for expanding rightward, but not as urgent as eating the apple.\n- **LEFT to (6,8):** Backtracking is risky\u2014could lead to a dead-end or enemy ambush. Avoid unless necessary.\n- **DOWN to (7,7):** Safe but doesn\u2019t help reach the apple. Could be useful for blocking the enemy later, but not urgent.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\n- The enemy is at (6,2). If they move UP to (6,3), they might threaten the (6,6) apple. If they move RIGHT to (7,2), they could block my path to (8,4) or (9,4). However, for now, eating the apple at (7,4) is the best move to grow and expand my reach.\n\n---\n\n**DOWN**",

However, Snake #1 could move UP to (6,5) and threaten (6,6) or my path.\n- **RIGHT to (8,4):** Safe and moves me closer to the (9,4) apple. This is a better long-term play as it expands rightward, which is safer.\n- **DOWN to (7,3):** Safe but doesn\u2019t help reach the apple.\n- **LEFT to (6,4):** Invalid (Snake #1\u2019s body).\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\n- Snake #1 is at (6,2) with body at (6,3), (6,4). If they move **UP to (6,5)**, they could threaten (6,6) or my path. If they move **RIGHT to (7,2)**, they could block my path to (8,4) or (9,4). However, moving **RIGHT to (8,4)** is safer as it expands my reach and avoids potential threats from Snake #1\u2019s upward movement.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe **RIGHT** move is the best choice\u2014it\u2019s safe, prioritizes apple collection, and sets up future flexibility by expanding rightward.\n\n**RIGHT**",

Moves toward the apple at (6,6).\n2. **DOWN (to (6,3))**: Unsafe. Moving down would hit my own body at (6,3).\n3. **LEFT (to (5,4))**: Safe. Moves away from the closest apple (6,6) but could be part of a path to the apple at (2,1).\n4. **RIGHT (to (7,4))**: Safe. Moves toward the apple at (7,4) and collects it immediately.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Moving RIGHT is the best option as it allows me to collect the apple at (7,4) immediately.\n- Moving UP is also a good option as it moves toward the apple at (6,6), but it doesn't collect an apple immediately.\n- Moving LEFT is safe but less optimal for immediate apple collection.\n\n**Potential Risks:**\n- If I move RIGHT to (7,4), I collect the apple and grow.\n- The enemy snake is currently not blocking any immediate paths to apples.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best move is RIGHT, as it allows me to collect the apple at (7,4) immediately.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",
