Apples everywhere but ignore 'em for now? Nah, we gotta grow to dominate, but first\u2014survival and positioning.\n\nLet's check moves:\n\nUP from (4,9) \u2192 (4,10) \u274c Off the board. Dead. Not an option.\n\nDOWN from (4,9) \u2192 (4,8) \u2705 Empty cell, no enemy body, safe.\n\nLEFT from (4,9) \u2192 (3,9) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n\nRIGHT from (4,9) \u2192 (5,9) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n\nAll three moves safe for now. But we gotta think about enemy movement. Enemy head at (4,0). They can go UP to (4,1), DOWN off board (dead), LEFT to (3,0), RIGHT to (5,0). They'll avoid dying, so likely UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (4,8), we're moving toward center but also toward enemy? Not directly threatening yet. If we go LEFT or RIGHT, we're staying top row.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to control space, cut off enemy's expansion, maybe try to trap them against a wall later. Right now, we need length advantage to force head-on collisions later. So maybe move toward nearest apple while keeping options open.\n\nNearest apples: (3,7) is close if we go DOWN then LEFT etc. (0,4) far. (6,7) if we go RIGHT then DOWN.\n\nBut more important: Which move gives most future safe squares? Let's check:\n\nDOWN to (4,8): From there, possible next moves: UP (back to start), LEFT (3,8), RIGHT (5,8), DOWN (4,7). That's 3 new safe moves (since UP is safe but just back). Good.\n\nLEFT to (3,9): Next moves: DOWN (3,8), RIGHT (back to start), UP off board. Only 1 new safe move (DOWN). Bad.\n\nRIGHT to (5,9): Next moves: DOWN (5,8), LEFT (back), UP off board. Only 1 new safe move (DOWN). Bad.\n\nSo DOWN is clearly better for flexibility. Also moves us toward center and apples.\n\nEnemy prediction: They'll likely go UP to (4,1) to avoid walls. No direct collision risk this turn.\n\nPlan for next turns: After DOWN, aim for apple at (3,7) or (6,7) while keeping an eye on enemy's vertical advancement. Try to stay at least same length or grow faster.\n\nAlright chat, we're going DOWN for flexibility and board control! Let's lock it in. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT keeps us stagnant with no reward, and we\u2019d lose momentum. So UP is the play \u2014 it keeps us in the center column, keeps multiple escape routes open, and keeps pressure directly beneath the rival. If he commits downward, we can lean left or right and threaten to box him against the wall, maybe even bait a collision once he\u2019s lower.\n\nPLAN NOTE: Stay between him and the top apples, keep closing the vertical gap, and once he hesitates, cut off his sideways escape to force a bad angle or a head-on.

Nah, we need to GROW to dominate, but first\u2014survival and positioning.\n\nLet\u2019s check our moves from (4,8):\n\nUP \u2192 (4,9) \u2705 Empty, safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (4,7) \u2705 Empty, safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,8) \u2705 Empty, safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,8) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now. But we gotta think about where the enemy will go this turn. Enemy head at (4,1). Their safe moves: UP to (4,2), LEFT to (3,1), RIGHT to (5,1). DOWN to (4,0) is off board? Wait, board bottom is y=0, so (4,0) is valid but that\u2019s their current tail? Actually they have no body yet, so (4,0) is empty. But moving DOWN from (4,1) to (4,0) is safe unless we go there\u2014we\u2019re not. So they have 4 safe moves too.\n\nWe want to avoid a head-on collision this turn. Where could they go?  \nIf they go UP to (4,2), no conflict.  \nIf they go LEFT to (3,1) or RIGHT to (5,1), no conflict.  \nIf they go DOWN to (4,0), no conflict with us.\n\nSo no immediate collision risk. Good.\n\nNow, long-term: We need to start boxing them in while growing. They\u2019re near bottom, we\u2019re near top. If we move DOWN to (4,7), we\u2019re moving toward center and toward them\u2014maybe start cutting off their upward expansion. But moving LEFT or RIGHT might let us flank.\n\nCheck apples nearby: (3,7) is close if we go LEFT then DOWN next turn. (6,7) if we go RIGHT then DOWN. (0,4) far.\n\nBut more important: Which move gives us the most future safe squares and doesn\u2019t trap us? Let\u2019s evaluate:\n\nUP to (4,9): From there next moves: DOWN (back to start), LEFT (3,9), RIGHT (5,9). Only 2 new safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). UP is off board. Not great.\n\nDOWN to (4,7): Next moves: UP (back), LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7), DOWN (4,6). That\u2019s 3 new safe moves. Good.\n\nLEFT to (3,8): Next moves: UP (3,9), RIGHT (back), DOWN (3,7). That\u2019s 2 new safe moves. Okay.\n\nRIGHT to (5,8): Next moves: UP (5,9), LEFT (back), DOWN (5,7). That\u2019s 2 new safe moves.\n\nSo DOWN again gives most flexibility. Also moves us toward center and apples. Enemy likely moving UP toward apples at (3,4) or (5,4) eventually. We want to get longer first so we can force head-on collisions later when we have length advantage.\n\nPlan for next few turns: After DOWN to (4,7), maybe go LEFT toward (3,7) apple next turn if safe, or RIGHT toward (5,7) apple. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s y-position\u2014if they\u2019re moving up fast, we might need to cut them off horizontally.\n\nAlright chat, we\u2019re going DOWN again for board control and options!

Apples everywhere but we\u2019re playing for board control and aggression!\n\nFirst, check our moves from (4,7):\n\nUP \u2192 (4,8) \u2705 Empty, safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (4,6) \u2705 Empty, safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,7) \u2705 Apple here! Eating grows us to length 2.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,7) \u2705 Apple here too! Also grows us.\n\nAll four moves are safe immediately. But we gotta think about where the enemy will go THIS TURN. Enemy head at (4,2). Their safe moves: UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), RIGHT to (5,2). All safe right now.\n\nPotential head-on collision?  \nIf we go LEFT to (3,7) and they go\u2026 nowhere near us.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (5,7), same.  \nIf we go UP to (4,8) or DOWN to (4,6), still far.\n\nNo direct collision risk this turn. Good.\n\nBut we WANT to grow to get a length advantage so we can force head-on collisions later. So eating an apple now is key. Which apple?  \nLEFT (3,7) apple or RIGHT (5,7) apple?  \nCheck enemy\u2019s likely path: They might move UP toward apples at (3,4) or (5,4). We want to cut them off from expanding upward. If we go LEFT to (3,7), we\u2019re closer to the left side\u2014might help us control that flank. If we go RIGHT to (5,7), closer to right side.\n\nAlso think about future safe moves after eating:  \nIf we go LEFT to (3,7) and grow, our body will be [(3,7), (4,7)]. Next turn from (3,7), safe moves: UP (3,8), DOWN (3,6), LEFT (2,7). RIGHT is our body at (4,7) so not allowed. That\u2019s 3 safe moves.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (5,7) and grow, body: [(5,7), (4,7)]. Next turn from (5,7), safe moves: UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), RIGHT (6,7). LEFT is body. Also 3 safe moves.\n\nBoth give same flexibility. But look at board: Apple at (3,4) is below left side, apple at (5,4) below right side. Enemy at (4,2) \u2014 if they go UP twice they can reach (4,4) which is empty. We want to possibly cut them off by moving down toward them after eating.\n\nI think going LEFT to (3,7) sets us up to move DOWN next to (3,6) then further down toward (3,4) apple, potentially blocking enemy\u2019s path up the left. Also keeps us nearer the cluster of apples on left side (0,4), (3,4), etc.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (5,7) also fine, but let\u2019s be decisive.\n\nAlso consider: If we eat, we grow to length 2. Enemy still length 1. That means next turn we can afford to be more aggressive\u2014if we have longer body, head-on collision kills them if we tie.\n\nLong-term plan after this move: After eating apple at (3,7), move DOWN toward (3,6) or (3,5) to pressure enemy\u2019s upward movement. Watch enemy\u2019s position\u2014if they move toward (4,3) or (3,3), we might try to cut off their escape by moving horizontally across above them.\n\nAlright chat, we\u2019re going LEFT to eat that apple, grow, and start dominating the left side! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Enemy still at (4,2) with no body, score 0. We have the length advantage! Time to press it!\n\nLet's check our moves from (3,7):\n\nUP \u2192 (3,8) \u2705 Empty, safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,6) \u2705 Empty, safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,7) \u2705 Empty, safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,7) \u274c That's our own body! CANNOT go right. So only UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nNow, we gotta predict where the enemy might go. Their head at (4,2). Their safe moves: UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), RIGHT to (5,2). All safe for them.\n\nHead-on collision risk?  \nIf we go LEFT to (2,7), they're nowhere near.  \nIf we go UP to (3,8), no.  \nIf we go DOWN to (3,6), still far.\n\nBut we want to be AGGRESSIVE! We have length 2, they have length 1. If we can force a head-on collision where we tie, WE WIN because we have more apples! So we should start moving TOWARD them to cut off their space and pressure them.\n\nLook at the board: Apples at (3,4) and (5,4) are below us. Enemy might move UP toward those. If we go DOWN to (3,6), we're one step closer to intercepting them. Next turn we could go further down to (3,5) or (3,4) to block their path up the left side.\n\nGoing LEFT to (2,7) moves us away from them\u2014maybe less aggressive.  \nGoing UP to (3,8) moves us toward top-left apples but away from the fight.\n\nWe want to DOMINATE the center and left side. Down feels right. But wait\u2014let's think about future safe moves after each option:\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,6):  \nNext turn from (3,6), body at [(3,6), (3,7), (4,7)]? Wait, we grow only if we eat an apple. We didn't eat this turn, so length stays 2. Our body will be [(3,6), (3,7)]? Actually, movement: head goes to (3,6), tail moves? In Snake, when no apple eaten, tail moves forward one. So our body becomes [(3,6), (4,7)]? No\u2014let's track: current body: head (3,7), then (4,7). After moving DOWN to (3,6), new head at (3,6). The segment at (4,7) becomes the tail and stays? Wait, in simultaneous movement, the body follows: the old head becomes new body segment 1, the old tail moves? Actually in this game, \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\" So when we move without eating, we pop the last tuple (tail) and insert new head at front. So body becomes [(3,6), (3,7)]. Yes! So tail from (4,7) disappears, new body is head (3,6) followed by (3,7). So then from (3,6) next turn, safe moves: UP (back to (3,7) which is our body) \u274c, DOWN (3,5) \u2705, LEFT (2,6) \u2705, RIGHT (4,6) \u2705. That's 3 safe moves. Good.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,7): body becomes [(2,7), (3,7)]. Next turn from (2,7), safe moves: UP (2,8) \u2705, DOWN (2,6) \u2705, LEFT (1,7) \u2705, RIGHT (3,7) is body \u274c. Also 3 safe moves.\n\nIf we go UP to (3,8): body becomes [(3,8), (3,7)]. Next turn from (3,8), safe moves: UP (3,9) \u2705, DOWN (3,7) body \u274c, LEFT (2,8) \u2705, RIGHT (4,8) \u2705. Also 3 safe moves.\n\nAll give similar flexibility. But DOWN puts us closer to enemy and apples (3,4). We can start boxing them in from above.\n\nAlso, enemy might go UP to (4,3). If we go DOWN to (3,6), then next turn we could go DOWN again to (3,5), then (3,4) to grab that apple and block their leftward escape.\n\nLong-term plan: Move down the left side, force enemy toward the right wall or into our body. Use our length advantage to threaten head-on collisions. If they ever move toward us, we can meet them and win the tie.\n\nChat, we're going DOWN to pressure them! Let's go! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We have more apples, so if we force a head-on collision where heads meet, WE WIN! So we should move to cut off their space and pressure them.\n\nLook at the board: There's an apple at (3,4) and (5,4) near them. They'll likely move toward an apple. If they go LEFT to (3,4), they get the apple and grow to length 2 \u2014 then we lose our length advantage! We can't let that happen!\n\nWe should move to block that apple or threaten them.

That's fine, we still have the length advantage. But denying (3,4) is priority.\n\nAlso, think about future safe moves:  \nIf we go DOWN to (3,5): body becomes [(3,5), (3,6)].

Next turn from (2,6), safe moves: UP (2,7) \u2705, DOWN (2,5) \u2705, LEFT (1,6) \u2705, RIGHT (3,6) body \u274c. Also 3 safe moves.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (4,6): body becomes [(4,6), (3,6)]. Next turn from (4,6), safe moves: UP (4,7) \u2705, DOWN (4,5) \u2705, LEFT (3,6) body \u274c, RIGHT (5,6) \u2705. Also 3 safe moves.\n\nAll give similar flexibility.

Use our length to threaten head-on collisions if they come up. If they go for (5,4) apple, we can maybe cut them off later.\n\nChat, we're going DOWN to deny that apple and press the advantage! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let's break it down! \ud83d\ude24 Turn 5, we're in a POWER position!\n\nOur head: (3,5) \ud83d\udc0d  \nOur body: [(3,6)] (just one segment behind us)  \nEnemy head: (4,5) \ud83d\ude08 right next to us to the RIGHT!  \nWe have length 2, they have length 1 \u2014 WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE!  \n\nFirst, check our possible moves from (3,5):  \nUP \u2192 (3,6) \u274c That's our own body! CANNOT go up.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,4) \u2705 Empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,5) \u2705 Empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,5) \ud83d\ude31 That's the ENEMY HEAD'S CURRENT POSITION \u2014 but they will move this turn too! If we move RIGHT and they move LEFT into (3,5), we swap places, no collision. If they stay still (unlikely) or move elsewhere, we might land on an empty cell. But wait \u2014 simultaneous movement means if we both move into the same cell (like they go LEFT to (3,5) and we go RIGHT to (4,5)), we don't collide because we're moving to each other's old spots. Actually, let's think:  \nIf we go RIGHT to (4,5) and they go LEFT to (3,5), we swap \u2014 no issue.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (4,5) and they go UP to (4,6) \u2014 then we both go to (4,5) and (4,6) respectively, fine.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (4,5) and they go RIGHT to (5,5) \u2014 then (4,5) is empty for us, fine.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (4,5) and they go DOWN to (4,4) \u2014 fine.  \nSo RIGHT is *potentially* safe? But risky if they decide to stay still (unlikely). Actually, moving into the cell where their head *currently* is, is safe as long as they move away. But if they move into our current cell (3,5), we swap. So RIGHT is *not* an immediate death move. \u2705  \n\nBut chat, here\u2019s the BIG BRAIN PLAY: We have a length advantage! If we force a head-on collision where heads meet in the same new cell, WE WIN because we have more apples! So we should try to predict where they'll go and intercept!  \n\nEnemy at (4,5) \u2014 their safe moves:  \nUP \u2192 (4,6) \u2705  \nDOWN \u2192 (4,4) \u2705  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,5) \u2705 That's our current head position \u2014 if they go LEFT, they'd move into our current cell. But we won't be there if we move.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,5) \u2705  \n\nThey might go for apples: closest apples are at (3,4), (5,4), (6,5). (3,4) is one down and left from them? Actually from (4,5), (3,4) is DOWN+LEFT. They can't move diagonal. So they'd need two moves. (5,4) is DOWN+RIGHT from them. (6,5) is RIGHT+DOWN. They might go DOWN to (4,4) to get closer to apples at row 4.  \n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,4), we grab that apple next to us! That grows us to length 3, extends our lead! But then our head is at (3,4), body at [(3,4),(3,5)]? Wait, after eating apple, new head at (3,4), tail stays? Actually, when we eat an apple, we grow next turn \u2014 so this turn we move to (3,4) (apple), we grow immediately? Yes \u2014 move onto apple \u2192 grow by 1 segment instantly, so new length 3, body becomes [(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)]? Let's check: current body: head (3,5), then (3,6). If we move DOWN to (3,4) and eat apple, new head at (3,4), old head (3,5) becomes second segment, (3,6) third. So yes, length 3.  \n\nBut if we go DOWN to (3,4), enemy could go LEFT to (3,5) \u2014 then we're at (3,4), they're at (3,5), adjacent. Next turn we could potentially collide if we go UP to (3,5) and they stay? But risky.  \n\nAlternatively, if we go LEFT to (2,5), we move away from enemy, less pressure.  \n\nIf we go RIGHT to (4,5) and they go LEFT to (3,5), we swap \u2014 no collision, but we're now at (4,5), they're at (3,5). Then next turn we're adjacent again.  \n\nBut the AGGRESSIVE play: go RIGHT to (4,5) and HOPE they go LEFT to (3,5) \u2014 that's a swap, fine. But if they go DOWN to (4,4), we're at (4,5), they're at (4,4) \u2014 we're above them, could trap them against bottom wall?  \n\nActually, the SAFEST move that also gets us an apple is DOWN to (3,4). That grows us, extends lead, and we're closer to bottom-left where there are more apples.  \n\nLet's check immediate dangers:  \nDOWN to (3,4): could enemy also go to (3,4)? They'd need to go LEFT to (3,5) then DOWN to (3,4) in two moves, not possible this turn. So no direct collision this turn. Safe.  \n\nLEFT to (2,5): safe, but no apple.  \n\nRIGHT to (4,5): risk? If enemy stays still (unlikely), we move into them? They'd die? Wait, if they stay at (4,5) and we move into (4,5), our head hits their head? Actually no \u2014 they'd be stationary, so their head is at (4,5) at start of turn, we move into (4,5) \u2014 that's moving into another snake's head? That's a head-on collision only if both move into same cell. If one is stationary, the moving snake dies because they hit a stationary snake's head? Let's check rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" Their head is part of their body. So if they stay at (4,5) and we move into (4,5), we die. So RIGHT is risky if they choose to stay. Unlikely but possible. I'd avoid that risk.  \n\nSo DOWN is safe and gets apple.  \n\nNext turn plan: after eating apple at (3,4), we're length 3, enemy length 1. We can try to box them against wall or force collision.  \n\nChat, we're going DOWN to grab that apple and extend our lead! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Turn six and we\u2019re still chasing those apples while the rival sits on two, so it\u2019s time to stay locked in on that column 4 choke and force him to sweat.

UP puts me on (4,7) and an apple, but it also abandons the vertical squeeze I\u2019m building.

DOWN to (4,5) keeps me dialed into the flank, stays within the corridor he can\u2019t easily escape, and leaves the north/south pivot open for the next swing.

Don\u2019t toss a head-on when I\u2019m down on apples; instead, bait him into the trap by staying vertical and ready to pounce once he overcommits.

Let's assess the board.\n\nOur snake (ID 1): Head at (3,4), body at [(3,5), (3,6)] \u2014 length 3, apples 2.  \nEnemy snake (ID 0): Head at (4,6), no body \u2014 length 1, apples 0.  \nWe have a MASSIVE advantage! We're longer, we can bully him! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nFirst, check our possible moves from (3,4):\n\nUP \u2192 (3,5) \u274c That's our own body! CANNOT go up.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,3) \u2705 Empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,4) \u2705 Empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,4) \u2705 Empty.\n\nAll three moves are safe from immediate self-collision or board edge. Now, consider enemy movement from (4,6). Their safe moves: UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6). They might go for apples? Closest apples: (3,3), (5,4), (6,5). They might move DOWN to (4,5) to get closer.\n\nWe need to think about head-on collisions: If we move into a cell they also move into, we both die. But we have more apples, so a double KO means WE WIN! \ud83d\ude08 That's a valid aggressive tactic! But we must ensure we don't die alone.\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n**DOWN to (3,3)** \u2014 There's an apple there! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it grows us to length 4 instantly. Enemy could go DOWN to (4,5) or LEFT to (3,6). No chance they reach (3,3) this turn. Safe and grows our lead. After moving, our head is at (3,3), body at [(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)]. Next turn, we might be near bottom wall but still mobile.\n\n**LEFT to (2,4)** \u2014 No apple. Moves us away from enemy. Could be safe but passive. Enemy might go DOWN to (4,5), increasing distance. Not aggressive enough.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,4)** \u2014 No apple. Puts us right below enemy's possible DOWN move to (4,5). If enemy goes DOWN to (4,5), we're adjacent vertically. Could set up a trap next turn. But no immediate gain.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to box enemy against the top wall or force a collision while we have length advantage. Enemy is at (4,6), near top (y=9). If we move RIGHT to (4,4), we're directly below them. Next turn, if they go DOWN to (4,5), we could go UP to (4,5) for a head-on collision \u2014 we win! But they might not go DOWN.\n\nActually, the most aggressive play: Move RIGHT to (4,4) and HOPE they go DOWN to (4,5). Then next turn we go UP to (4,5) for the double KO win. But if they go LEFT to (3,6) or elsewhere, we miss.\n\nBut chat, we have a sure thing: DOWN to (3,3) gets an apple, grows to length 4, extends lead to 3 apples. That's HUGE! Then we can hunt enemy with even more length. Safety first, but dominance second! Going for the apple is both safe and increases our power.\n\nCheck: Could enemy move to (3,3) this turn? From (4,6), they'd need two moves, impossible. So DOWN is 100% safe from collision.\n\nTherefore, the play is DOWN \u2014 secure the bag, grow the snake, then crush next turn! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating apple at (3,3), we're length 4. Enemy still length 1. We should move to cut off their escape, maybe go RIGHT to (4,3) or LEFT to (2,3) to position ourselves to intercept their path to apples. Force them toward a wall.\n\nDOWN",

Let's assess the board.\n\nOur snake (ID 1): Head at (3,3), body at [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)] \u2014 length 4, apples 3.  \nEnemy snake (ID 0): Head at (4,5), no body \u2014 length 1, apples 0.  \nWe have a MASSIVE length advantage! We can bully him into a corner! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nFirst, check our possible moves from (3,3):\n\nUP \u2192 (3,4) \u274c That's our own body! CANNOT go up.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,2) \u2705 Empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,3) \u2705 Empty (apple at (2,3) but we ignore apples for strategy? Wait, eating grows us, that's good!).  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,3) \u2705 Empty.\n\nAll three moves are safe from immediate self-collision or board edge. Now, consider enemy movement from (4,5). Their safe moves: UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4), LEFT (3,5), RIGHT (5,5).\n\nWe need to think about head-on collisions: If we move into a cell they also move into, we both die. But we have more apples, so a double KO means WE WIN! \ud83d\ude08 That's a valid aggressive tactic!\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n**DOWN to (3,2)** \u2014 No apple. Moves us away from enemy. Could be safe but passive. Enemy might go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5). Not aggressive enough.\n\n**LEFT to (2,3)** \u2014 There's an apple there! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it grows us to length 5 instantly. Enemy cannot reach (2,3) this turn (they're at (4,5)). Safe and grows our lead. After moving, our head is at (2,3), body at [(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)].\n\n**RIGHT to (4,3)** \u2014 No apple. Puts us closer to enemy. If enemy goes DOWN to (4,4), we're adjacent vertically. Could set up a head-on collision next turn if they go DOWN again to (4,3) and we go UP to (4,3)? But simultaneous moves \u2014 this turn, no collision.\n\nBut wait, aggressive play: If we go RIGHT to (4,3) and enemy goes DOWN to (4,4), we are directly below them. Next turn, if they go DOWN again to (4,3) and we go UP to (4,3), it's a head-on collision \u2014 WE WIN because we have more apples! But they might not go DOWN.\n\nHowever, the SURE thing is LEFT to (2,3) to get the apple, grow to length 5, and increase our lead to 4 apples vs 0. That's HUGE! Then we can easily trap the enemy against the top wall.\n\nCheck: Could enemy move to (2,3) this turn? From (4,5), impossible. So LEFT is 100% safe from collision.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating apple at (2,3), we're length 5. Enemy still length 1. We should move to cut off their escape. They are at (4,5). We can move RIGHT to (3,3) or UP to (2,4) to position ourselves to intercept. Force them toward the top wall (y=9) or right wall (x=9). With our length, we can create a barrier.\n\nLEFT",

UP puts us closer to top wall, can herd them toward corner.\n\nCheck safety: UP (2,4) is empty. No enemy body. Enemy head could move to (3,4) or (4,5) etc., not (2,4). So safe.\n\nLEFT (1,3) also safe, but less aggressive.\n\nDOWN (2,2) safe but passive.\n\nLet's choose UP to press the advantage and start boxing them in against the top-right.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving to (2,4), look to move RIGHT to (3,4) to directly threaten and cut off their westward escape.

Actually, we didn't eat an apple last turn (we moved from (2,3) to (2,4), no apple there), so our tail should have moved? Let's check: Our body was [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] last turn, head at (2,3). We moved UP to (2,4). New head (2,4), body becomes [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)] \u2014 tail at (3,4). Yes! So (3,5) is now empty! That means next turn, (3,5) is free! That's huge!\n\nSo plan: This turn go UP to (2,5). Next turn, we can go RIGHT to (3,5) \u2014 that's empty now \u2014 and that directly blocks enemy's potential path upward? Enemy at (4,3) could go UP to (4,4) this turn, then next turn maybe UP again to (4,5). But if we're at (3,5) next turn, we're adjacent and threatening a head-on collision if they go LEFT to (3,5)? Wait, simultaneous moves \u2014 they could go LEFT from (4,5) to (3,5) same turn we go RIGHT to (3,5) \u2014 that's a head-on collision! And we have higher score, so we WIN! \ud83d\ude08\n\nBut we need to consider what enemy does THIS turn. If they go UP to (4,4), then our plan works. If they go DOWN or LEFT or RIGHT, they might be elsewhere. But going UP is a natural move for them \u2014 avoids our body wall on left. We're herding them north!\n\nGoing LEFT to (1,4) is safe but passive \u2014 we lose pressure.\n\nAlso, check immediate collision risk this turn: If we go UP to (2,5), enemy could go UP to (4,4) \u2014 no collision. Enemy could go LEFT to (3,3) \u2014 no. Enemy could go RIGHT to (5,3) \u2014 no. Enemy could go DOWN to (4,2) \u2014 no. So safe.\n\nLEFT to (1,4) also safe.\n\nBut UP is AGGRESSIVE and starts the encirclement! Let's lock in UP!\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving to (2,5), look to go RIGHT to (3,5) to directly threaten head-on collision if enemy moves north. If enemy moves elsewhere, we continue to cut off the board and push them toward top-right corner. Use our length to create barriers!\n\nUP",

Time to execute the plan from last turn!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\nOur head is now at **(2,5)** after moving UP last turn. Body: [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)] \u2014 length 5.\nEnemy head at **(4,2)**, no body \u2014 length 1.\nApples on board, but we're hunting the enemy, not snacks!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFE MOVES FROM (2,5):**\n- UP \u2192 (2,6) \u2705 Empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,4) \u274c That's our own body! CANNOT go down.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,5) \u2705 Empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5) \u2705 Empty (our tail moved from (3,5) last turn, now free!).\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nEnemy at (4,2). Their possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (4,3)\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,1)\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,2)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,2)\n\nNo immediate collision risk with us this turn unless we both pick same cell \u2014 but we're not adjacent.\n\n**EXECUTE THE PLAN:**\nLast turn we said: \"After moving to (2,5), look to go RIGHT to (3,5) to directly threaten head-on collision if enemy moves north.\" That's still the move! Going RIGHT puts us at (3,5), which:\n- Blocks enemy's potential path if they go UP twice? Actually, if enemy goes UP this turn to (4,3), next turn they could go UP again to (4,4). We'd be at (3,5) \u2014 not directly blocking, but we're adjacent horizontally. We could then go RIGHT to (4,5) next turn to cut off top.\n- More importantly, going RIGHT gets us CLOSER to enemy, applying pressure. If we go LEFT to (1,5), we're running away \u2014 WEAK! If we go UP to (2,6), we're moving toward top wall but not cutting off enemy's expansion.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION THREAT:**\nWe have length 5 vs their length 1. If we force a head-on collision, WE WIN because we have more apples! So we should be AGGRESSIVE and try to corner them.\n\n**BOARD CONTROL:**\nOur body forms a partial wall along column 3 from y=3 to y=4, and we have segments at (2,3),(2,4). Enemy is at (4,2). If we go RIGHT to (3,5), we're positioning to swing down and right to herd them toward the bottom-right corner? Actually, we want to push them toward a wall or our body.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nAfter moving to (3,5), next turn consider:\n- If enemy goes UP to (4,3), we could go DOWN to (3,4) \u2014 but that's our body? Wait, (3,4) is our body now, but next turn after moving, our tail moves? Actually, our tail is at (3,4) now. After we move to (3,5), our body becomes [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] \u2014 tail at (2,3). So (3,4) becomes empty! That means next turn, (3,4) is free. So we could go DOWN to (3,4) to further block enemy's leftward escape.\n- Alternatively, if enemy stays low, we can continue moving right/down to encircle.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FOR RIGHT MOVE:**\nMoving RIGHT to (3,5) is safe \u2014 no walls, no bodies, no enemy heads moving there this turn (enemy can't reach (3,5) in one move). Good.\n\n**CHAT, WE'RE BOXING HIM IN!** \ud83d\ude08 Let's lock in RIGHT and keep the pressure!\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, after moving, our body becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] \u2014 tail at (2,3). So (2,4) becomes body next turn, so not free). Actually, let's think: after moving DOWN to (3,4), our new body: head (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (2,3). So (2,4) is occupied next turn. So from (3,4) next turn, safe moves would be UP (back to (3,5) \u2014 empty then?), DOWN to (3,3) \u2014 our old body but will be empty after tail moves? Wait, tail is at (2,3), so (3,3) becomes free next turn. So DOWN would be safe next turn. RIGHT to (4,4) free. LEFT to (2,4) not free. So we'd have UP, DOWN, RIGHT next turn \u2014 okay.\n\nBut more importantly, going DOWN to (3,4) puts us closer to enemy, threatening to cut off their upward escape if they survive. They might go LEFT or RIGHT to avoid us.\n\n**WHAT IF THEY GO UP INTO OUR BODY?**\nIf enemy goes UP to (3,3) \u2014 they DIE! That's a free win! So we should encourage that by staying close but not blocking their path upward? Actually, if we go DOWN to (3,4), we're directly above (3,3), so they might think twice. But they might still do it accidentally.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE: RIGHT to (4,5)**\nThis moves us toward the right side, maybe to encircle from the east. But we give them space to expand upward.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nIf we go DOWN to (3,4), next turn we can:\n- If enemy is at (3,1) or (2,2), we can continue moving DOWN/RIGHT to herd them into bottom-left corner.\n- We have length advantage, so force head-on if possible.\n\n**CHAT, WE'RE MAKING THEM UNCOMFORTABLE!** \ud83d\ude08 Let's go DOWN and keep the pressure high!

Their possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (2,3) \u274c That's OUR body at (2,3)!

No risk of same-cell collision this turn.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE BOXING PLAN:**\nWe want to force the enemy into a corner! If we go RIGHT to (4,4), we're moving away from them \u2014 WEAK! If we go DOWN to (3,3), we're moving closer and positioning ourselves to cut off their rightward escape!\n\nFrom (3,3) next turn, we could threaten (3,2) or (4,3), keeping pressure. The enemy is at (2,2). If they go RIGHT to (3,2), we could potentially meet them head-on next turn if we also go DOWN to (3,2)? But that's simultaneous move \u2014 risky. Better to herd them toward the bottom-left corner where they have fewer moves.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**\nIf we go DOWN to (3,3):\n- Next turn, from (3,3), safe moves likely DOWN to (3,2) (if enemy isn't there), LEFT to (2,3) (our old tail, likely free), RIGHT to (4,3) (free). That gives options.\n- Enemy will likely avoid (2,3) because it's our body, so they might go DOWN to (2,1) or LEFT to (1,2). We can then swing left/down to cut off the bottom.\n- With our length advantage, we can afford to be aggressive and force a head-on collision if we can predict their move. They have no body, so they're more maneuverable \u2014 we need to limit their space!\n\n**CHAT, WE'RE GOING IN FOR THE KILL!** \ud83d\ude08 Let's go DOWN and corner this worm! DOWN\n\nDOWN",

UP is suicide.\n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nEnemy at (3,2). Their possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (3,3) \u274c That's OUR HEAD! If they go UP into us simultaneously, that's also a head-on collision \u2014 they'd die and we'd win.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,1) \u2705 Empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,2) \u2705 Empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,2) \u2705 Empty.\n\nThey have 3 safe moves unless they're dumb and go UP into us.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION CALCULUS:**\nIf we go DOWN to (3,2) and enemy stays still (DOWN for him is (3,1)), we'd move into his old cell and he'd move away \u2014 NO COLLISION. But if he goes UP to (3,3), we meet at (3,2) \u2014 COLLISION! Since moves are simultaneous, we can't guarantee it. But we have a length advantage (5 vs 1), so in a head-on collision, we WIN because we have more apples! That means going DOWN is a **WINNING GAMBIT** \u2014 if we collide, we win the round! If we don't collide, we land on (3,2) and he's elsewhere.\n\n**BUT IS DOWN ACTUALLY SAFE?** Wait \u2014 moving into (3,2) is only unsafe if the enemy is there AFTER movement. If he moves away, it's empty. So DOWN is *potentially* safe, but risks collision. Since collision means we win (4 apples vs 0), DOWN is a **WIN-MOVE** either way! Either we survive, or we win the round. That's HUGE!\n\n**LEFT vs RIGHT vs DOWN:**\n- LEFT to (2,3): Puts us closer to bottom-left, maybe cut off enemy if he goes left. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (4,3): Moves us away from enemy, gives space but less pressure.\n- DOWN to (3,2): AGGRESSIVE! Forces the issue! If enemy goes UP, we win. If enemy goes LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT, we occupy his old spot and are now adjacent to him next turn, ready to box him further!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe have a massive length advantage! We should use it to TRAP HIM! If we go DOWN and survive, next turn we can push him toward the edge. He has no body, so he's slippery \u2014 we need to limit his moves. Going DOWN risks a winning collision or positions us aggressively. Going LEFT or RIGHT is safer but less decisive.\n\nCHAT, THIS IS THE MOMENT! Do we take the guaranteed win if he's dumb and goes UP? Or do we play safe and herd him? I SAY GO FOR THE THROAT! We win on collision, and if we don't collide, we're on top of him! **DOWN** is the AGGRESSIVE WINNING MOVE! \ud83d\ude24\n\nDOWN",
