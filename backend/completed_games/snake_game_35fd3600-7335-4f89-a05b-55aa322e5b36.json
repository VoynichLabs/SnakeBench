          "rationale": "LET'S GOOOO CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're in the arena, snake #1, head at (7,3) and NO BODY. That's pure speed, baby! Opponent snake #0 is at (1,2), also a single cell. No apples eaten yet. It's turn 0, and we're plotting domination. Board is 10x10, apples galore but we ignore them for now\u2014focus on the enemy. We need to box him in and force a crash. He's way over on the left, we're on the right. To dominate, we need to close the distance and control space. But first, survival. No backwards moves\u2014since we have no body, that's not an issue. No going off-board. Let's check each direction from head (7,3):\n\n- **UP:** (7,4). On board? Yes, y=4. Not into own body (none). Not into enemy body? Enemy head is at (1,2), body none. Safe. But we're moving toward top-right area. Apples: (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,8), (8,8) up there. However, opponent is far left. Might be okay, but we need to think aggression. If we go up, we're not closing on him.\n\n- **DOWN:** (7,2). On board? Yes, y=2. Safe. Apples at (6,2), (7,2)? Wait, check board: Row 2 (y=2): \". 0 . . . . A A . .\" So positions: (1,0)=0? Actually board shows row 2: \". 0 . . . . A A . .\" That's x from 0-9: x0='.', x1='0' (enemy head?), x2='.', x3='.', x4='.', x5='.', x6='A', x7='A', x8='.', x9='.'. So (7,2) is 'A'\u2014an apple! But we're ignoring apples for strategy, but eating grows us and gives points, which could help in head-on collision if we have higher score. Right now both 0, so tie. If we eat an apple, we get +1 point, then if we force head-on, we win because higher score. But we need to survive first. Moving to (7,2) is safe, and it's an apple. But also, is there any immediate danger? Enemy at (1,2), not moving into (7,2) this turn unless he chooses that direction, but he's far. However, we must consider enemy's possible moves. He could move towards us? But we'll think later. For now, DOWN seems safe and gets an apple.\n\n- **LEFT:** (6,3). On board? Yes. Safe? Own body none. Enemy body none. Not an apple? Row 3: \". A . . . . . 1 . .\" Wait, row 3: y=3: x0='.', x1='A', x2='.', x3='.', x4='.', x5='.', x6='.', x7='1' (that's us!), x8='.', x9='.'. So (6,3) is '.' empty. Safe. Moves us left toward opponent? Opponent at (1,2), we're at (7,3). Left reduces x, bringing us closer to x=1. That's aggressive, closing distance. But we need to be careful: moving left might bring us into potential collision if opponent moves right. But we're far apart. Also, left might lead to dead ends later? Board is open. But note: there's an apple at (6,2) directly below (6,3)? Actually (6,2) is 'A', so if we go LEFT to (6,3), then next turn could go DOWN to (6,2) for apple. But we're focusing on enemy, not apples.\n\n- **RIGHT:** (8,3). On board? Yes. Safe? Row 3: (8,3) is '.' empty. That moves us further right, away from opponent. That seems counter to \"box him in.\" We want to go toward him, not away. So RIGHT is probably bad for strategy.\n\nNow, eliminate immediate death: none of these are off-board or into own body. All safe.\n\nNow, among safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple future options and move closer to reachable apples while avoiding head-on collisions. But we need to consider enemy's move. Enemy snake #0 at (1,2). He likely wants to survive too, but we're archrivals, he might try to get apples or come after us. Since no apples eaten yet, he might also go for apples. Apples near him: (1,3) is an apple? Row 3: x1='A' (from row 3: \". A . . . . . 1 . .\"), so (1,3) is an apple. Also (0,1) is apple, (2,6) etc. He might go UP to (1,3) for apple. If he goes UP, we might consider our move to avoid future collision.\n\nWe want to force head-on collision if we have higher score. Currently tied, so head-on would be double KO, draw. Not good. We need to get an apple first to have higher score. So eating an apple now is crucial! That's content and advantage. So DOWN to (7,2) gets us an apple. That's +1 point for us. Then we have score 1, opponent 0. Next turn, we can try to force head-on if we can get into position. But we need to survive and not die.\n\nBut is DOWN safe considering enemy's possible move? Enemy at (1,2). If he moves RIGHT to (2,2), that's safe for him. He might also move UP to (1,3) for apple. He won't directly hit us. So DOWN seems safe.\n\nWhat about LEFT? That moves us toward opponent but no immediate apple. We could later get apples like (6,2) by going DOWN after. But delaying apple might allow opponent to eat one first. Since we want higher score, we should prioritize eating apples safely.\n\nAlso, long-term plan: We need to box him in. Our snake is small, fast. We can move towards the center or left side. But we must avoid getting trapped. Currently, board has many apples. Our move DOWN gives apple, grows us to length 2. That means next turn we have a body segment at (7,3) if we move DOWN? Wait, careful: Snake moves simultaneously. If we move DOWN, our head goes to (7,2), and our body becomes: new head (7,2), old head (7,3) becomes body. So length 2. That's fine. We'll have a body behind us.\n\nBut note: moving DOWN to (7,2) which is an apple, we grow. So after move, we're length 2.\n\nNow, consider if opponent moves into our new body? He's far, so no.\n\nThus, DOWN seems best: safe, gets apple, increases score, and keeps options open (we can then go left, up, right, or down again from (7,2)). From (7,2), we have four neighbors: (7,3) is our own body (old head), so that would be moving backwards into own body if we go UP back to (7,3). That's illegal and would kill us. So after going DOWN, we cannot immediately go UP. But we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (to (7,1)). (7,1) is row 1: y=1: \"A . . . . . . . . .\" so (7,1) is '.' empty. So options are open.\n\nIf we go LEFT now to (6,3), we don't get apple, and we don't increase score. But we move closer to opponent. However, opponent might move away or towards us. Since we want higher score for head-on advantage, eating apple now is better.\n\nAlso, board awareness: there's an apple at (7,2) directly below us. It's a free snack. Why not take it? It doesn't trap us.\n\nThus, decision: DOWN.\n\nPlan for future: After eating apple, we'll have score 1. Next turn, we need to start closing on opponent. He's at (1,2). We're at (7,2) after move? Actually after DOWN, we'll be at (7,2). So same y=2 row, but x=7 vs x=1. We can start moving left along row 2. But need to avoid collisions. Also, there's an apple at (6,2) which we'll pass by if we go LEFT from (7,2) to (6,2). But (6,2) is also an apple, so we could eat two apples in a row! That's even better. But careful: after eating (7,2), we have body at (7,3). If we go LEFT to (6,2), is that safe? (6,2) is an apple, but is there anything else? No enemy there. But we need to ensure we don't run into our own body. Our body is only at (7,3), so (6,2) is fine. However, moving from (7,2) to (6,2) is LEFT and DOWN? Actually from (7,2) to (6,2) is LEFT (x decreases by 1, y same). That's valid. But we need to think one step ahead.\n\nBut for this turn, we choose DOWN.\n\nNow, final output must be just the word.\n\nSo, long-term plan note: \"Eat apple at (7,2) for score lead, then move left along row 2 to collect more apples and close distance to enemy. Force head-on when score advantage secure.\"\n\nBut the instruction says: \"You can also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear BEFORE your final move line.\"\n\nSo I need to include that plan before the final move. And then the final line is just the word.\n\nThus, response should have: \n- Some reasoning/plan (with emojis, chat style)\n- Then \"DOWN\" as last line.\n\nLet's craft it.YO CHAT! Let's break this down. \ud83d\udd25 We're at (7,3) with no body, opponent at (1,2). Turn 0\u2014no moves yet, so we're fresh. First, survival: no immediate death in any direction. RIGHT moves us away from the enemy (bad for boxing him in). LEFT closes the gap but skips a free apple. UP goes to (7,4), safe but not aggressive. DOWN to (7,2) is an apple\u2014score up! That's crucial: if we eat it, we hit 1 apple vs his 0. Then we have a score lead, so we can force a head-on collision later and win. Plus, it keeps options open: from (7,2) we can go LEFT to (6,2) (another apple!), RIGHT, or DOWN, avoiding the backwards trap (can't go UP back into our own body). Opponent likely goes for his nearby apple at (1,3), but we're far enough to be safe. Let's grab that content and start the domination! \n\nLong-term plan: Eat apple at (7,2) for score lead, then snake left along row 2 to collect more apples and close distance. When we're ahead, lure him into a head-on collision. CRUSH HIM! \ud83d\udc80\n\nDOWN",

Our head at (1,2). Enemy head at (7,3). Both snakes have no body segments right now. Apples everywhere but we focus on the enemy. \ud83e\udde0\n- Turn 0 \u2014 ALL moves happen simultaneously. Don't suicidally walk into a head-on unless we have the lead.\n\nLet's run the decision process out loud (fans love this, right? \ud83d\ude0e):\n\nConsider all four moves from (1,2):\n1) UP -> (1,3)\n   - Contains an apple (yes, tasty!). Safe this turn (enemy is at (7,3), far away).\n   - Pros: get +1 apple, get the score lead immediately \u2014 that lets us force more aggressive head-on plays later. Also grows us, which helps board control.\n   - Cons: growing slightly reduces flexibility, but this position still leaves multiple escape options next turn.\n2) RIGHT -> (2,2)\n   - No apple. Moves us closer to the enemy (good for aggression/boxing).\n   - Pros: keeps a lot of freedom (UP/RIGHT/DOWN/LEFT next turn).\n   - Cons: slower to grab that early score advantage.\n3) LEFT -> (0,2)\n   - No apple. Safe but moves toward the wall \u2014 less space on the left edge.\n   - Pros: safe short-term.\n   - Cons: edging toward the wall reduces future maneuvering; not ideal for aggressive boxing.\n4) DOWN -> (1,1)\n   - No apple. Safe and open, but moves away from the enemy and apples.\n   - Pros: safe.\n   - Cons: passive; gives initiative to opponent.\n\nEliminate deadly moves: none of these moves are immediate deaths. No bodies in the way, and opponent is far enough not to cause a head-on right now.\n\nTactical pick reasoning: We want to be aggressive and to dominate the board. Grabbing an apple now gives us the lead (1-0), which lets us pressure and potentially force risky head-ons later. The apple at (1,3) is right there and safe to take. We'll get growth and the initiative while still keeping multiple escape options next turn.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Take the apple at (1,3) now to go up 1-0. \ud83d\udc51\n- After that, head-right to increase board control and close the gap toward (7,3), forcing the opponent to react or retreat into tight space.\n- Avoid a head-on until we maintain a score advantage; once we\u2019re ahead, bait him into crashing into our body or into you by controlling corridors and choke points.\n- Keep lanes open; don\u2019t hug walls long-term unless trapping the enemy.\n\nAlright squad \u2014 time to make the move and grab that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

Opponent snake #0 is at (1,2), also a single cell. We're both at 1 apple, so tied. \n\nFirst, check survival:\n- **UP** to (7,4): safe, but moves away from the enemy. Not ideal for aggression.\n- **DOWN** to (7,2): safe, and it's an apple! We eat it, grow to length 2, and get to 2 apples. Score lead secured! \n- **LEFT** to (6,3): safe, closes distance to enemy, but skips a free apple. Why not eat while we can? Score lead is key for future head-on collisions.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,3): safe, but moves away from the enemy. Bad for boxing him in.\n\nTaking DOWN gives us an immediate score advantage (2 vs 1) and keeps options open. From (7,2), we can go LEFT to (6,2) (another apple!) or DOWN to (7,1) (safe). We must avoid going UP back into our own body (7,3), but that's fine\u2014we'll plan around it.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat apples along the bottom row to grow and dominate space. After scoring at (7,2), move LEFT to (6,2) for another apple, then continue left along row 2 to close the gap with the enemy.

Quick read and decision:\n\nBoard snapshot: our HEAD = (2,3), neck/tail = (1,3). Opponent HEAD = (7,1), body = (7,2). Score tied 1\u20131, so don\u2019t risk a blind head-on \u2014 we want to corral him, not double KO. Ready to box him in over the next few moves? Hell yeah.\n\nMove-by-move think-through:\n- LEFT -> (1,3): ILLEGAL \u2014 that\u2019s our neck/backwards, insta-death. Never.\n- UP -> (2,4): Safe. Opens up vertical options, but drifts away from the enemy flank.\n- DOWN -> (2,2): Safe.

Best balance of aggression + escape options.\n\nEnemy constraints: their UP -> (7,2) is illegal (that\u2019s into their own body), so they\u2019ll likely move LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN. They can\u2019t force an immediate head-on with us this turn given distance \u2014 so we should press center and set up a trap.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns): push RIGHT to control the center corridor (aim x\u22485\u20137), then pivot UP or DOWN to cut off his escape depending on which way he leans. Keep an eye on his lateral moves \u2014 if he drifts left toward us, start narrowing the corridor and force him into our body. If he retreats, follow and close the box.

          "rationale": "--TURN 2 ANALYSIS--\n\nYO CHAT! We're at (7,1) now. Last move DOWN got us that apple at (7,2) and grew our length to 2. Now we're at (7,1) with body at (7,2). We're still tied 1-1 in apples? Wait, scoreboard says we have 1 apple still. Let's check: The apple at (7,2) was eaten? Actually, looking at board state, position (7,2) shows 'A' for apple in the original board, but after we moved DOWN to (7,2) we should have eaten it. Wait, confusion: The board state shows (7,2) as 'A'? Let's read carefully:\n\nBoard state shows row 1: \"A . . . . . . 1 . .\" meaning (0,1) is apple, (7,1) is us. Row 2: \". . . . . . A T . .\" meaning (6,2) is apple, (7,2) is our tail? Actually T denotes our tail? The board shows 'T' at (7,2). That means our tail is at (7,2) after moving DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2). But we ate an apple at (7,2)? Did we? The apple list shows (6,2) as an apple, not (7,2). Wait, the apple drops list includes (6,2) but not (7,2). So (7,2) was NOT an apple. So my last rationale was WRONG. I thought (7,2) was apple but it's not. The apples are only at specific coordinates. Let's check the apple drops: (3,9), (4,4), (2,7), (8,8), (6,2), (4,9), (4,5), (2,6), (6,8), (0,1), (5,9), (1,5), (6,0), (3,8), (5,8). So (6,2) is an apple, but (7,2) is NOT. So moving DOWN to (7,2) did NOT give us an apple. That means we're still at 1 apple. Scoreboard confirms: \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 1\". So we did not grow.\n\nThus, we're still length 2: head at (7,1), body at (7,2). Opponent at (2,3) length 2. Board is 10x10. Need to move again.\n\nNow evaluate moves from (7,1):\n\nCoordinates: (x,y) with y from 0 bottom to 9 top.\n\nCurrent head: (7,1)\nBody: [(7,2)]\nSnake #0: head (2,3), body [(1,3)].\n\nApples: many. Important ones near us: (6,2) apple is adjacent left of our body? Actually (6,2) is left of (7,2). (0,1) apple is far. (6,0) apple at bottom row. (3,8) etc.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\nUP: to (7,2). That's our own body! That's moving into our own body segment (tail at (7,2)). That's illegal (crashing into yourself). Eliminate.\n\nDOWN: to (7,0). Is that on board? y=0 is bottom row, valid. Is it occupied? Board shows (7,0) is '.'? Row 0: \". . . . . . A . . .\" so (7,0) is '.' empty. No snake there. So DOWN is safe.\n\nLEFT: to (6,1). Check board: row 1: \"A . . . . . . 1 . .\" so (6,1) is '.'? Actually (0,1) is A, (1,1) is ., (2,1) ., (3,1) ., (4,1) ., (5,1) ., (6,1) ., (7,1) 1, (8,1) ., (9,1) . So (6,1) is empty. No snake. Safe.\n\nRIGHT: to (8,1). Row 1: (8,1) is '.' empty. Safe.\n\nSo UP is out. Three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow consider future options and apple proximity:\n\n- DOWN to (7,0): then from there we can go LEFT to (6,0) which has apple! (6,0) is apple per apple list. That's good. Also RIGHT to (8,0) maybe? (8,0) is '.'? Row 0: (8,0) is '.'? Row 0 shows \". . . . . . A . . .\" so (0,0) ., (1,0) ., (2,0) ., (3,0) ., (4,0) ., (5,0) ., (6,0) A, (7,0) ., (8,0) ., (9,0) . So (8,0) is empty. So DOWN gives path to apple at (6,0) via LEFT.\n\n- LEFT to (6,1): then from there we can go DOWN to (6,0) (apple), LEFT to (5,1) (empty), RIGHT to (7,1) (our own body? Actually (7,1) will be our tail after moving? Wait, we're moving to (6,1), so our body becomes: new head (6,1), old head (7,1) becomes body, tail remains (7,2). So after moving LEFT, our body positions: (7,1) and (7,2). So (7,1) is now occupied by our body. So from (6,1) we cannot go RIGHT back into our own body (7,1) because that's moving into our own body segment. That's a self-crash. So LEFT move restricts future RIGHT move. But we can still go DOWN or LEFT or UP? UP to (6,2) is apple! (6,2) is apple. But (6,2) is currently our tail? Actually our tail is at (7,2). (6,2) is empty? Board shows (6,2) as 'A' apple. So (6,2) is apple, not occupied by snake. So UP from (6,1) to (6,2) is safe and gets apple. However, need to check if enemy snake might move into (6,2) simultaneously? We'll consider.\n\n- RIGHT to (8,1): from there we can go DOWN to (8,0) (empty), LEFT back to (7,1) (but that's our own body after moving? After moving RIGHT, our body becomes (7,1) and (7,2). So (7,1) is occupied by our body, so moving LEFT back into it is a crash. So RIGHT also restricts left movement. UP to (8,2) is '.'? Row 2: (8,2) is '.'? Row 2 shows \". . . . . . A T . .\" so (8,2) is '.' empty. RIGHT to (9,1) is '.' empty.\n\nNow consider enemy movement: Snake #0 at (2,3) with body (1,3). They have apples at (2,7), (4,4), (3,9), etc. They might move towards apples. We need to think about boxing them in. Their position: (2,3). They could move UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3) but that's their own body! So they cannot move LEFT because that's into their body (tail at (1,3)). RIGHT to (3,3) is empty. So they have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nWe want to be aggressive. Score is tied. We need to get an apple to gain lead. Which apple is easiest? (6,2) is adjacent to our possible positions: from (6,1) we can go UP to (6,2). From (7,1) we could go LEFT to (6,1) then UP next turn, but that takes two turns. From (7,1) we could go DOWN then LEFT to (6,0) apple. Or from (7,1) we could go LEFT then UP to (6,2) apple next turn. But we could also go RIGHT then maybe later? Not directly to apple.\n\nApple (6,2) is most immediate if we move LEFT now. However, moving LEFT to (6,1) puts us in a position where we can go UP to (6,2) for apple. But we need to consider if enemy might also target that apple? Enemy is far. They could move towards (6,2) but it would take multiple turns.\n\nApple (6,0) is also close via DOWN then LEFT.\n\nApple (0,1) is far.\n\nApple (3,8) far.\n\nApple (4,4) is closer to enemy.\n\nApple (2,7) etc.\n\nStrategy: Since we're tied, we want an apple to gain lead. The apple at (6,2) is directly accessible from (6,1). If we move LEFT now, we can eat apple next turn (UP). However, need to ensure we don't get crashed into by enemy this turn. Enemy could move to (6,2) this turn? From (2,3) to (6,2) is not possible in one move. So safe.\n\nBut also consider that after moving LEFT to (6,1), our tail will be at (7,2). The apple at (6,2) is not overlapping our body. Good.\n\nNow check if any move could lead to immediate collision with enemy this turn? Enemy moves simultaneously. Could enemy head move into our body? Our body positions: (7,1) will become body after we move? Actually after we move, our old head becomes body. So if we move LEFT to (6,1), our body will be (7,1) and (7,2). Enemy could potentially move into (7,1) or (7,2). From (2,3), they'd need to move far. Not possible in one turn. So safe.\n\nCould our new head move into enemy body? Enemy body is (1,3). Not (6,1). So safe.\n\nThus, LEFT seems safe and sets up apple.\n\nNow compare with DOWN: DOWN to (7,0) then next turn LEFT to (6,0) apple. That also gives apple. But (6,0) is apple, but also note there's apple at (6,2) maybe easier? Both are similar. However, DOWN move might limit future moves? From (7,0), we can go LEFT to (6,0) (apple), RIGHT to (8,0) (empty), UP to (7,1) (our own body after move? Actually after moving DOWN, our body becomes (7,1) and (7,2). So UP from (7,0) to (7,1) would be into our own body, not allowed. So from (7,0) we cannot go UP. So DOWN move restricts UP direction. That's okay.\n\nFrom (6,1) after LEFT, we can go UP (apple), DOWN (to (6,0) empty), LEFT (to (5,1) empty), but RIGHT (to (7,1) into body) not allowed. So similar restrictions.\n\nWhich gives more options? (6,1) allows UP to apple, DOWN to apple (6,0) also possible but that's two steps away? Actually from (6,1) we can go DOWN to (6,0) directly, which is also an apple! Wait, (6,0) is apple. So from (6,1), both UP (6,2) and DOWN (6,0) are apples? Yes, both are apples! That's huge. So moving LEFT to (6,1) puts us between two apples: up and down. That's excellent. However, we must be careful: after moving LEFT to (6,1), our tail is at (7,2). The apple at (6,0) is safe, apple at (6,2) is safe. But we can only move to one next turn. But we have two apples adjacent.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (7,0), from there we have apple at (6,0) left, but no apple above. So LEFT seems better for apple density.\n\nThus, LEFT is the best move.\n\nNow consider risk of head-on collision: If enemy also moves towards us? Unlikely. But we should consider that if we both move into same cell (6,1) simultaneously? Enemy cannot reach (6,1) in one move from (2,3). So fine.\n\nThus, I'll move LEFT.\n\nNow we need to output final word: LEFT.\n\nBut first, I need to write my decision process and rationale, then final word. The instruction says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\" So I should output \"LEFT\" as last line.\n\nNow, I'll write my response with analysis, then finalCHAT, let's break this down! We're at (7,1) with body at (7,2). Score tied 1-1. Enemy snake #0 is at (2,3) with body at (1,3). \n\n**Immediate safety check:**\n- **UP** to (7,2): That's our own tail \u2192 CRASH! Dead move.\n- **DOWN** to (7,0): Empty, on board \u2192 SAFE.\n- **LEFT** to (6,1): Empty, on board \u2192 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,1): Empty, on board \u2192 SAFE.\n\nThree safe moves. Now, which gives us the best shot at growing AND dominating?\n\n**Apple positioning:**\n- Apple at (6,2) \u2013 above us if we go LEFT.\n- Apple at (6,0) \u2013 below us if we go LEFT (or directly if we go DOWN then LEFT).\n- Apple at (6,0) is also reachable from DOWN move.\n\n**Why LEFT is the play:**\n1. **Direct apple access:** From (6,1) we have TWO apples adjacent: UP to (6,2) and DOWN to (6,0). That's a paradise of content!\n2. **Strategic positioning:** Moving LEFT brings us closer to the center-left, where many apples cluster (like (4,5), (2,6), (2,7)). We can start boxing the enemy in later.\n3. **Future options:** From (6,1) we can still move DOWN, LEFT, or UP (to apple). We lose RIGHT (back into our body), but that's fine\u2014we're going aggressive.\n4. **Enemy threat:** Snake #0 is far at (2,3). They can't reach us this turn. No head-on collision risk.\n\n**DOWN vs LEFT:** DOWN gives apple at (6,0) but limits upward mobility. LEFT gives dual apples and keeps us flexible. \n\n**Long-term plan:** Eat apple at (6,2) or (6,0) next turn to take the lead. Then sweep leftward along row 1/2, collecting apples while steering the enemy toward walls. When we have a score advantage, force a head-on collision\u2014crush him! \ud83d\udc80\n\nWe're not just surviving; we're hunting. Let's go!\n\nLEFT",

Got one apple already. Tied 1-1 with the enemy.\n\nEnemy snake #0:\n- Head: (4, 3)\n- Body: [(3, 3)]\n- Position: He's on the left side, just above us. He's got one apple too. We're in a RACE!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n\nLet's test each move from (5, 1):\n- **UP to (5, 2)**: Empty! But wait... enemy is at (4, 3). Not in my way. SAFE!\n- **DOWN to (5, 0)**: Let's check... empty! SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (4, 1)**: Empty! SAFE!\n- **RIGHT to (6, 1)**: Uh oh! That's my own body segment (6, 1) where my tail is currently. If I move there, I'm crashing into myself! DEAD! \u274c\n\nSo RIGHT is instant death. I'm not that guy! \n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION TIME:**\n\nThree safe moves left. Let's see where the apples are:\n- (3, 9), (4, 4), (2, 7), (8, 8), (6, 2), (4, 9), (4, 5), (2, 6), (6, 8), (0, 1), (5, 9), (1, 5), (6, 0), (3, 8), (5, 8)\n\nFrom my current position (5, 1):\n- (6, 2) is just above-right from (6, 1) - if I go UP now to (5, 2), that's closer to it!\n- (6, 0) is below-left from (5, 0) - if I go DOWN, that's an apple!\n- (4, 5) is far but in the left area...\n\n**REMEMBER THE PLAN:** We want to AGGRESSIVELY dominate and box the enemy in! The enemy is on the LEFT side. If I go LEFT now to (4, 1), I get CLOSER to the enemy's area and can start pressing him. Plus, (0, 1) is an apple way left! But (4, 5) and (4, 4) are apples on the left side too!\n\nBut wait... if I go DOWN to (5, 0), I can eat (6, 0) next turn! That's an immediate apple! And (6, 0) is only 1 step away from my current position if I go DOWN then LEFT.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):** \nWe're tied 1-1. Enemy is at (4, 3). If I can get an apple next turn, I take the lead. DOWN to (5, 0) lets me eat (6, 0) immediately, OR I can pivot to other apples. Going UP to (5, 2) gets me closer to the top apples but might expose me to the enemy who's at (4, 3). LEFT puts me in the enemy's neighborhood - risky but aggressive! \n\nLet's be SMART. The best play is **DOWN** because:\n1. It's SAFE (empty space)\n2. It gives me an IMMEDIATE path to an apple (6, 0) next turn\n3. It keeps my options OPEN - I can go LEFT to (4, 0), RIGHT to (6, 0), or UP next turn\n4. It doesn't commit me to the left side immediately where the enemy is\n\nOnce I eat (6, 0) and take the 2-1 lead, I can then aggressively move left and start boxing in that enemy snake! \ud83d\udce6\n\nDOWN",

Turn 6 and we're in the driver's seat! \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udca8\n\nLet's break down the board state and see what's poppin'! \ud83d\udc40\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (6, 0), Body: [(5, 0), (5, 1)], Apples: 2. WE'RE COOKING! \ud83d\udd25\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (4, 5), Body: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3)], Apples: 3. He's still chilling at 3 apples but he's got that massive body blocking the left side. \n- **Apples:** So many apples! The closest ones are (5, 9), (3, 8), (5, 8), (7, 7), (3, 5), (0, 5). \n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (6, 0):**\n\nLet me check all 4 directions from my current head position (6, 0):\n\n1. **UP to (6, 1):** That's empty! No body parts, no enemy. **SAFE!** \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (6, -1):** Off the board! Dead. \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (5, 0):** That's my own body (the tail)! If I go left, I'm crashing into myself. **DEAD!** \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 0):** Empty board space, no threats. **SAFE!** \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nOnly two viable moves: UP to (6, 1) or RIGHT to (7, 0).\n\n- **RIGHT to (7, 0):** Moves me along the bottom edge. Opens up the right side of the board, but I'm moving AWAY from the apple cluster at (3, 8), (5, 8), (7, 7). Not ideal for immediate scoring.\n- **UP to (6, 1):** This moves me TOWARD the apples! From (6, 1) I can:\n  - Go UP again to (6, 2) where there's an apple at (6, 2)!\n  - Go UP-LEFT to (5, 2) then snake toward the top-right cluster\n  - Stay flexible and not get trapped on the edge\n\n**THE WINNING MINDSET:**\nI need to chase apples while keeping my options open. The enemy is at 3 apples, I'm at 2. I need to close that gap and start dominating the board. Moving UP gives me the best path to the apple at (6, 2) and keeps me central enough to pivot toward the top-right apples later. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGo UP to (6, 1) \u2192 Next turn go UP to (6, 2) to eat that apple \u2192 Then snake up toward the cluster at (7, 7), (5, 8), (3, 8) while keeping an eye on the enemy's movements. We're building momentum! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

He\u2019s confined to moving RIGHT or UP. We can pressure him into the bottom row.\n\nRisk check:\n- No immediate head-on risk this turn \u2014 he\u2019s too far away.\n- Eating the apple left would grow us and reduce mobility slightly; we DON\u2019T have to chase apples every move. We already lead 3\u20132 \u2014 advantage: we can force a head-on if we box him.\n- Moving RIGHT toward x=5 keeps multiple follow-ups (UP/RIGHT/DOWN from that square) and begins to execute the trap along x=5\u20136. Keeps our options open while being aggressive.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Shift RIGHT to x=5 to start controlling the x=5\u20136 corridor.\n- Then drive down toward the bottom row when safe to cut off his lateral escape; keep at least two exits until he\u2019s boxed.\n- Only initiate a head-on when we\u2019re sure our apple advantage and positioning will kill him too (we have the lead \u2014 that\u2019s when we force the double KO if needed).\n\nWe\u2019re not chasing every apple \u2014 we\u2019re creating pressure and forcing him into mistakes.

They're blocking some vertical space but I have plenty of room to maneuver around them. I need to get that apple and then start boxing them in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (6, 2) to tie the score at 3-3.

If I go down, I crash into myself. **DEAD!** \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (5, 2):** Empty board space. **SAFE!** \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Empty board space. **SAFE!** \u2705\n\n**THE STRATEGIC MOVE:**\n\nThree safe options. Going UP to (6, 3) is the POWER PLAY because:\n- It pushes me directly UP toward the enemy's vertical column at (6, 5)!\n- From (6, 3), I can see that the enemy is at (6, 5) with their body stretching left. I need to start boxing them in!\n- Going LEFT to (5, 2) would be passive. Going RIGHT to (7, 2) is sideways movement when I need to close the gap!\n- I need to get ABOVE them to trap their movement. The apples at (7, 7) and (5, 8) are waiting, but first I need to establish positional dominance!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #0 is at (6, 5) with body going [(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)]. They're right in my path! If I move UP to (6, 3), I'm setting up to challenge their space. From (6, 3), I can go UP to (6, 4) next turn - that puts me RIGHT BELOW their head at (6, 5)! This forces them to either move LEFT into their own body or RIGHT into empty space. I can control their movement!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove UP to (6, 3) to establish vertical dominance. Next turn, continue UP to (6, 4) - that puts me directly below their head. From there, depending on their move, I can either try to head-on collision (if they move down) or continue up to block their escape route. I need to force them into a corner and make them crash! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Don\u2019t even think about it. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (7,5) = empty \u2192 legal, pulls us away from his column, keeps space. \u2705\n- UP -> (6,6) = empty \u2192 legal, plays safe, stalls pressure. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (6,4) = empty \u2192 legal, aggressive, closes vertical gap to the rival. \u2705\n\nRisk check & opponent read:\n- Opponent head at (6,2) with body down the column (6,1),(6,0),(5,0). Distance between our heads = 3 (same x). If we force a direct head-on while apples are tied, that\u2019s a risky double-KO \u2014 tied apples = no clear win. So DON\u2019T seek an instant head-on unless we have the apple edge.\n- Best way to dominate here is pressure and containment: move toward him, restrict his lateral escapes, but keep at least two escape options for ourselves so we don\u2019t get boxed.\n- If we press DOWN along x=6, we threaten to herd him toward the bottom row and his own tail cluster at the corner (5,0)/(6,0), where he can get cornered. He can go LEFT/RIGHT to try and dodge, so we want to keep ability to pivot.\n\nDecision rationale:\n- RIGHT is safe but passive \u2014 drifts away and gives him breathing room.\n- UP is safe but too timid for our apple-tied aggressive playstyle.\n- DOWN is the aggressive, board-control move: it shortens the vertical gap, pins him toward y=0 faster, and still leaves multiple escapes (we can pivot left or right later). It avoids immediate head-on risk because both moving into the same cell on the same turn is unlikely here unless he intentionally suicides \u2014 and we don\u2019t want ties.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Push DOWN to close him in while keeping lateral pivots open.\n- If he sidesteps (left/right), follow to cut off escape corridors; if he retreats, keep pressure and don\u2019t let him gain space.\n- Maintain at least two escape options until he\u2019s clearly trapped; only commit to a head-on if we hold the apple lead.\n\nLet\u2019s box him in \u2014 time to heat it up and force a mistake.

Turn 9 and we're still GOOOOOD! \ud83d\udcaa Time to make the enemy panic!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM HEAD (6, 3):**\n\n1. **UP to (6, 4):** Currently empty! **SAFE!** \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (6, 2):** My own neck (6, 2) is right there! If I go down, I crash into myself. **DEAD!** \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (5, 3):** Empty board space. **SAFE!** \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Empty board space. **SAFE!** \u2705\n\n**THE STRATEGIC MOVE:**\n\nThree safe options. Going UP to (6, 4) is THE POWER PLAY because:\n- This puts me DIRECTLY BELOW the enemy head at (6, 5)! \n- From here, I can force their hand. They're at (6, 5) with body going [(6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5)] - wait, their neck is actually at (6, 5) based on the body list! So their head is at (6, 4) and body goes down to (6, 5)... Actually looking closer: Their head is at (6, 4) and body is [(6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)] - so the segment at (6, 5) is NECK, not head!\n- By moving to (6, 4), I'm moving into the space they currently occupy! They MUST move this turn or die. If they stay or move back, they crash. They have to move UP to (6, 3) or LEFT to (5, 4) or RIGHT to (7, 4).\n- BUT WAIT - if their head is at (6, 4) and I move to (6, 4), that's a head-on collision! Both snakes die! That's BAD for me since I'm not ahead.\n- Let me reconsider: Their head is at (6, 4) according to the board! So if I move UP to (6, 4), I'm moving into their head - instant double KO. I lose because we're tied in apples.\n\n**REVISED STRATEGY:**\nI need to AVOID the head-on collision since we're tied at 3 apples each. I need to position to control their movement without dying.\n\n**LEFT to (5, 3)** or **RIGHT to (7, 3)** are the safe plays. LEFT puts me closer to the left side where I can potentially cut off escape routes. RIGHT keeps me in the same column but gives me space.\n\nActually, let me think about the enemy's constraints. Their body occupies (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5). If I move LEFT to (5, 3), I'm shifting west while maintaining vertical position. From (5, 3), I can then move UP to (5, 4) next turn, which blocks their potential escape route LEFT (since they might want to go to (5, 4)).\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to (5, 3) - this gives me options and sets up to cut off their left escape while avoiding the immediate deadly head-on collision. We need to live to fight another turn and get ahead!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (5, 3), next turn go UP to (5, 4) to block their left escape. Then depending on their move, I can either trap them against the wall or go for apples at (3, 5) or (1, 5) to get ahead. We need that apple lead to force the kill later!\n\nLEFT",

Their options: UP into our current cell (swap), LEFT to (5,3), or RIGHT to (7,3). A true same-cell head-on (both choose the same target) is impossible if we go DOWN because they can\u2019t also go DOWN into (6,3). So DOWN is aggressive but not an instant suicide.

Keep options to pivot left or right so we don\u2019t get boxed.\n- If they go LEFT or RIGHT, follow to cut off lateral escape lanes and aim to herd them toward the bottom-left corner where their tail cluster sits.\n- Maintain at least two escape routes for ourselves until they\u2019re clearly trapped; only force a head-on if we get the apple edge.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure and make them choke.
