A collision with the enemy snake or wall could be catastrophic. \n\nNext turn strategy: After moving left, I'll assess my new position and distance to the closest apple (currently at (6,4)). If I'm within a 2-step range, I'll aim straight for it, prioritizing growth over cautious incremental advances. If I'm still a bit too far, I'll try for a diagonal approach again, but this time with a more measured pace to hedge against unexpected obstacles or the enemy snake's movements.\n\nNext move: LEFT",

Taking a moment to analyze the board, the enemy snake is currently at (6,1), a ways off from my new position but still a threat if it moves aggressively my way. I've also got walls on my right and bottom edges, so expanding sideways or downwards isn't an option without risk.\n\nSo my top priority is maintaining a safe distance and steering clear of any potential conflicts. With that in mind, my next most beneficial move would be to ascend to (2,8), which puts me a bit higher up on the board without venturing too far. This also keeps me relatively close to the apple while minimizing the likelihood of running into any trouble.\n\nNext move: UP",
