If I want (6,6), I should move toward it now.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (6,6) this turn, and I go LEFT to (6,7), then next turn enemy\u2019s body will be at (6,5) and head at (6,6). I could still go DOWN to (6,6) next turn \u2014 but that\u2019s head-on collision with enemy\u2019s head if enemy stays there. Actually, if enemy eats apple at (6,6) this turn, enemy grows to length 2: head at (6,6), tail at (6,5). Next turn enemy could move away from (6,6), but if I move into (6,6) while enemy is still there, we collide. So maybe better to let enemy have (6,6) and target (4,7) or (3,7) instead.  \n\nBut (4,7) is 3 steps away, (3,7) is 4 steps.  \n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (6,7) and enemy goes UP to (6,6), next turn I cannot safely go DOWN to (6,6) unless enemy moves away. That\u2019s risky.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,6) and enemy goes UP to (6,6), next turn I can go LEFT to (6,6) \u2014 same risk.  \n\nSo maybe avoid competing for (6,6) this turn and instead go UP to (7,8) to stay clear, then head toward (4,7) or (3,7) via leftward moves.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nEnemy is short, not a big threat yet. Keep growing safely. Move toward (4,7) via (6,7) next if possible, but avoid head-on over apples. For now, UP is safe and opens space toward top-left apples later.  \n\nUP",

Eating it would grow me to length 3, tying enemy\u2019s length (enemy length 4? Wait, enemy had 3 apples before, so length 4 now). Actually enemy length = 4, mine = 2, eating apple makes me length 3.  \n\n**Future flexibility:**  \nUP to (2,9) \u2013 after eating apple, next turn my head at (2,9), body: [(2,8), (3,8)]. From (2,9), moves: DOWN (2,8) \u2013 my body, LEFT (1,9), RIGHT (3,9). Only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT).  \nLEFT to (1,8) \u2013 no apple, next turn from (1,8) moves: UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7), LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8) \u2013 my body. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nUP gives immediate apple, growth, but slightly limits next turn options (2 moves).  \nLEFT gives no apple but keeps more options open next turn.  \n\nGiven enemy is longer (length 4 vs my 2), growing quickly is important to compete. Also, enemy is at (2,7) and could move UP to (2,8) next turn, blocking me from returning to (2,8) later. If I take apple now, I deny it to enemy and grow.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll take UP to eat apple (2,9). This grows me to length 3, puts me at top edge but with two exits next turn (LEFT or RIGHT along top row). Enemy may move UP to (2,8) next turn, but that\u2019s fine\u2014I\u2019ll be at (2,9) and can go LEFT or RIGHT.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter eating apple at (2,9), next turn avoid going DOWN into possible enemy head at (2,8). Prefer LEFT to (1,9) or RIGHT to (3,9) to stay safe. Then aim for apple at (4,2) or (6,3) via cautious pathing, keeping distance from enemy until lengths are closer.  \n\nUP",

That\u2019s risky.  \nLEFT to (0,8) keeps me farther from enemy and gives more options next turn.  \nRIGHT to (2,8) puts me closer to enemy\u2019s possible RIGHT move to (3,6), but still safe this turn, but next turn only RIGHT is safe \u2014 too restrictive.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT to (0,8) is safest \u2014 avoids boxing myself in, maintains flexibility, and while it doesn\u2019t move me much closer to apples immediately, staying alive is priority. I can work down the left side toward (4,0) or (4,2) later.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nFrom (0,8), consider moving DOWN to (0,7) next turn to continue descending left column, then gradually move right toward apples while keeping distance from enemy. Monitor enemy\u2019s movement pattern \u2014 currently enemy is restricted in moves due to its own body, so it may move down/right away from me.\n\nLEFT",

If not, continue DOWN left column toward apple at (4,0). Keep monitoring enemy movement \u2014 it\u2019s likely heading toward (4,4) or (6,3).

Wait recalc: |1-4|=3, |5-2|=3, total 6. So my earlier 3 was wrong \u2014 sorry.  \nSo:  \n(1,5) \u2192 (4,2): dx=3, dy=3 \u2192 6.  \n(1,4) \u2192 (4,2): dx=3, dy=2 \u2192 5.  \n(2,5) \u2192 (4,2): dx=2, dy=3 \u2192 5.  \n(0,5) \u2192 (4,2): dx=4, dy=3 \u2192 7.  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both reduce distance to closest apple by 1.  \n\n**Future flexibility:**  \nFrom (1,4): moves UP (back to current head) is body next turn? Wait, after moving, my body will be [(1,5), (1,6), (0,6)]? No \u2014 after moving DOWN, new head (1,4), body becomes [(1,5), (1,6), (0,6)], tail stays at (0,6) unless I eat apple. So next turn from (1,4):  \n- UP \u2192 (1,5) \u2013 my body (segment behind new head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4) \u2013 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nFrom (2,5): new head (2,5), body [(1,5), (1,6), (0,6)]. Next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2,6) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,4) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,5) \u2013 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5) \u2013 enemy body at (3,5) currently, but enemy moves now. Could be safe or not depending on enemy move. Risky.  \n\nFrom (0,5): new head (0,5), body [(1,5), (1,6), (0,6)]. Next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (0,6) \u2013 my body (tail) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0,4) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,5) \u2013 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only DOWN safe next turn \u2014 very limiting.  \n\nSo LEFT is bad for future options.  \n\n**Risk of enemy path:**  \nEnemy at (5,4) might go for (4,2) apple: could go DOWN to (5,3), then LEFT to (4,3), then DOWN to (4,2) in 2 more turns.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), I\u2019m moving toward center but enemy is far for now.  \nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I\u2019m moving toward (4,0) apple area, away from enemy\u2019s likely path to (4,2).  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nEnemy is longer (5 vs my 3), so avoid direct confrontation. Head toward lower apples (4,0) or (7,0) while keeping space. From (1,4), next turn consider DOWN or LEFT to approach (4,0). Avoid moving into x=3+ where enemy might go.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN gives safe next moves and moves toward apples while staying clear of enemy\u2019s likely path to (4,2). RIGHT risks moving into area enemy might enter soon and limits next-turn options. LEFT is too limiting.  \n\nDOWN",
