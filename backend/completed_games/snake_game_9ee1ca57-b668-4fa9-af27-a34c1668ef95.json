I'm at the bottom edge (y=0), so DOWN would kill me (off the board).\n2. My head is at (2,0), so moving LEFT would take me to (1,0) and RIGHT to (3,0).\n3. The enemy is directly above me at (2,6), so we're vertically aligned but far apart.\n4. The closest apple is at (1,2) - just 2 cells left and 2 cells up from my current position.\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- DOWN: Invalid (would go off board)\n- LEFT: (1,0) - safe (empty space)\n- RIGHT: (3,0) - safe (empty space)\n- UP: (2,1) - safe (empty space)\n\nAll three remaining moves are safe. Now let's evaluate which is best:\n\n**Option 1: LEFT to (1,0)**\n- Gets me closer to the apple at (1,2)\n- Next turn I could go UP to (1,1) then UP to (1,2) to eat the apple\n- Keeps me away from the enemy's current position\n- Good path to nearest apple\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (3,0)**\n- Moves away from the nearest apple at (1,2)\n- Would take more turns to reach any apple\n- Less optimal for immediate apple collection\n\n**Option 3: UP to (2,1)**\n- Moves toward the apple at (1,2) but not as directly as LEFT\n- Still a reasonable approach path\n- Keeps more options open for future moves\n\n**Best Choice:**\nLEFT is the most direct path to the nearest apple at (1,2). It's safe and sets up a clear path to collect an apple in the next 2 moves.\n\n**Long-term note for next turn:**\n\"Heading toward apple at (1,2). Plan is LEFT this turn to (1,0), then UP next turn to (1,1), then UP to (1,2) to eat apple. Watch for enemy movement toward same apple.\"\n\nLEFT",

        "1": {
          "move": "LEFT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. So, I'm snake 1 with ID 1, and my head is at (2,6). The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The apples are at (4,8), (1,2), (9,7), (1,8), (7,5). \n\nFirst, I need to check all possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see where each move would take me.\n\nStarting with UP: From (2,6), moving up would take me to (2,7). Let me check if that's safe. The board shows in row 7 (which is y=7), there's an apple at (9,7). But my head moving to (2,7) \u2013 is there a snake body there? Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 7 (y=7) has an apple at (9,7), but the snake's body is not there. The enemy snake 0 is at (2,0), so no body parts around. So (2,7) seems safe. But wait, I need to check if moving there would collide with any other snake's body. Since the body lists for me and snake 0 are none, so moving up to (2,7) should be okay. Also, not moving backwards because I have no body. So UP is a possible move.\n\nDOWN: From (2,6) down would be (2,5). Again, check if that's safe. The board at row 5 (y=5) has an apple at (7,5). But (2,5) \u2013 no snake parts listed. So that seems safe. \n\nLEFT: (1,6). Check if that's occupied. The board's row 6 (y=6) has my head at (2,6), but (1,6) is empty. Snake 0's positions are at (2,0), so no. So LEFT is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (3,6). Also empty based on the board. So all four directions seem possible. But need to check for any immediate death.\n\nWait, but the rules mention that moving into another snake's body (including enemy's) is a death. Since the enemy snake 0 is at (2,0), their body is none, so moving into (2,0) would be bad, but that's not any of the current moves. So all four directions are safe in terms of immediate collision. So no move is eliminated. \n\nNow, the strategy is to prefer moves that allow eating apples and keep future options open. Let's look at the apples. The closest apples would be (9,7) is up 1 from my head (2,6 to 2,7 is one cell, but (9,7) is 7 cells to the right and same y). Wait, maybe that's not the closest. Let's list the apples:\n\n(4,8): up 2 and right 2.\n\n(1,2): left 1 and down 4.\n\n(9,7): right 7 and up 1.\n\n(1,8): left 1 and up 2.\n\n(7,5): right 5 and down 1.\n\nSo the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance might be (9,7) which is 7 right and 1 up (distance 8), but maybe (7,5) is right 5 and down 1 (distance 6). Or (1,8) is left 1 and up 2 (distance 3). Hmm, (1,8) is only 3 steps away. (2,6 to 1,8: x decreases by 1, y increases by 2. So total steps of 3. That's closer than others. So maybe moving towards (1,8) is good. \n\nAlternatively, (7,5) is 5 right and 1 down. From (2,6), moving right 5 would require 5 steps. (1,8) is 3 steps. (4,8) is 2 right and 2 up. So (1,8) is the closest. So perhaps moving towards (1,8) would be good. \n\nBut how to get to (1,8). From (2,6), moving UP once gets me to (2,7), then LEFT once to (1,7), then UP again to (1,8). But each move is one step. So maybe moving towards (1,8) would require moving LEFT and UP. But since I can only move one direction per turn, perhaps choosing a direction that brings me closer. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,6) would be one step, then from there, UP to (1,7) next turn, then UP again to (1,8). So moving LEFT now would start that path. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,7) could be part of a path to (4,8) or (9,7). \n\nBut I need to consider which move allows me to reach an apple with the best safety. Also, need to avoid getting trapped. \n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake 0 is at (2,0). They might be moving towards me, but since they have no body, unless they move into my path. But since they are at (2,0), which is far from my current position, maybe not an immediate threat. \n\nSo, considering the apples, (1,8) is the closest. So moving LEFT would get me to (1,6), which is one step closer. Alternatively, moving UP to (2,7) is one step up. \n\nBut let's think about the next steps. If I move LEFT to (1,6), next turn I can move UP to (1,7). Then next turn, UP again to (1,8) to get the apple. That's three moves. But each move has to be considered. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,7) would get me closer to (9,7) or (4,8). But (4,8) is two steps right and up. From (2,7), moving RIGHT to 4, but that's two steps. \n\nBut maybe moving LEFT is better now because it's a step towards (1,8). Also, moving LEFT might not block future moves. \n\nBut another thing to consider: after moving LEFT to (1,6), the next move could be UP, but if I move UP again, that's two steps. But maybe the enemy could interfere. However, since they are at (2,0), their movement is unknown. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,7) might be a better direction. Let me check if (2,7) is near any apple. The apple at (9,7) is same y, but 7 steps right. But (2,7) is also near (1,8) if I move LEFT next. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP now allows me to reach (1,8) in two moves (LEFT then UP). Wait, (2,7) to (1,8) is LEFT and UP. But each move is one direction. So from (2,7), moving LEFT would go to (1,7), then UP to (1,8). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (1,6) then UP to (1,7), then UP to (1,8). That's two moves after LEFT. \n\nSo both paths require two moves after the initial direction. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT now is better because it's a direct step towards (1,8). However, I need to check if moving LEFT is safe. \n\nWait, when moving LEFT to (1,6), is there any snake body there? The board state shows (1,6) is empty. So that's safe. \n\nAnother consideration: avoiding getting stuck. If I move LEFT, then next moves could be blocked. For example, if I move LEFT to (1,6), then next move could be UP to (1,7), but if that's blocked by something else, but currently, the board shows no obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP might be better because (2,7) is higher up and could be part of a path to other apples. \n\nBut the key is to maximize apple collection. The (1,8) apple is very close, so getting that would be good. \n\nAnother thing: the rules state that if moving into another snake's body, you die. Since enemy snake 0 is at (2,0), their body is none. So moving into (2,0) would be bad, but none of the current moves are towards that. \n\nAlso, the head-on collision: if another snake moves into my head's position. But since all snakes move at the same time, if enemy snake 0's head moves into my head's new position, both die. But enemy's head is at (2,0). If they move up, they could reach (2,1), (2,2), etc. But unless they move towards me, which is at (2,6) now. So maybe not a collision this turn. \n\nSo, among the four directions, all are safe. Now, which direction gives the best chance to eat apples and keep options open. \n\nThe (1,8) apple is the closest. So moving LEFT now would take me one step towards it. Alternatively, moving UP could be part of a path to other apples. \n\nBut maybe moving LEFT is better here. However, I should also consider that after moving LEFT, the next moves might have constraints. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP could be safer in terms of not getting trapped. Let me think about the board. \n\nIf I move UP to (2,7), then next turn I can move LEFT to (1,7), then UP to (1,8). That's two moves. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now to (1,6), then UP to (1,7), then UP to (1,8). \n\nEither way, two moves after the initial. \n\nBut perhaps moving UP now allows me to reach (1,8) in two moves, same as LEFT. \n\nBut maybe there's another factor. For example, if I move UP, then next turn I can choose to go LEFT or UP again. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT might be better because it's a step towards (1,8), but also, maybe the other apples. \n\nAnother thing: the apple at (7,5) is down and right. To get there, I need to move right and down. But that might take longer. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (4,8) is up and right. \n\nBut since (1,8) is the closest, prioritizing that makes sense. \n\nSo between LEFT and UP. Which is better? \n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,6), then next move UP to (1,7), then UP to (1,8). That's three moves. Wait, no: from (2,6) to (1,6) is LEFT. Then from (1,6) to (1,7) is UP. Then from (1,7) to (1,8) is another UP. So three moves to reach (1,8). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,7), then LEFT to (1,7), then UP to (1,8). That's three moves as well. \n\nSo same number of steps. \n\nBut maybe moving LEFT now is better because it's a direct path. Alternatively, moving UP could be part of a different path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT could be considered. But (3,6) is not near any apple. \n\nAnother factor: keeping future options open. If I move LEFT, then in the next step, I can go UP or LEFT again. If I move UP, then next step could be LEFT or UP again. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT is better because it's a direct step towards (1,8). \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is better because (2,7) is safer in terms of not being close to any other snake. \n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (2,0). If they move upwards, they could come towards me. But since they have no body, unless they move into my path. \n\nBut since their head is at (2,0), and my head is at (2,6), if they move up, they could approach. For example, if they move up 6 times, they could reach (2,6). But that's 6 moves. \n\nBut in the current turn, if I move UP to (2,7), and the enemy moves up to (2,1), that's not a collision. \n\nBut if the enemy moves up towards me, but in this turn, they can only move one cell. So unless they move up to (2,1), which is not near me. \n\nSo maybe moving UP is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT is safer in terms of not being on the same column as the enemy. \n\nBut the enemy's position is (2,0), so same x as my current head. If I move LEFT to (1,6), I'm on x=1, which is different. \n\nSo maybe moving LEFT reduces the chance of collision with the enemy if they move upwards. \n\nBecause if I stay at x=2, and the enemy moves up, they could approach. For example, if they move up from (2,0) to (2,1), then next turn to (2,2), etc. But that's a few turns away. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT now is better to avoid being in the same column. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think moving LEFT to (1,6) is a good choice because it's a step towards the closest apple (1,8), and it moves me away from the same x as the enemy snake, reducing collision risk. \n\nSo the move would be LEFT.\nLEFT",
