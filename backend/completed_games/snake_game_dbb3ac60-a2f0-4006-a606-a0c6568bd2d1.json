My last move was successful - I moved UP and collected the apple that was at (7, 6).\n\nCurrent situation analysis:\n- I'm at (7, 6) and have grown by one segment\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (7, 9) with body at [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)] - they're right above me but still 3 spaces away\n- Remaining apples: (2, 7), (0, 9), (2, 9), (6, 5), (7, 0)\n\nAvailable moves from (7, 6):\n- UP to (7, 7) - This moves me closer to the enemy snake at (7, 9), but there's still 2 spaces between us\n- DOWN to (7, 5) - Can't go here, that's my body segment (my neck)\n- LEFT to (6, 6) - Safe move, and positions me closer to the apple at (6, 5)\n- RIGHT to (8, 6) - Safe move, but doesn't lead toward any immediate apples\n\nThe enemy snake at (7, 9) is concerning because they're directly above me.

This seems like the safest and most productive path.\n\nThe apple at (2, 7) is also relatively close and would take me away from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy: Move LEFT to (6, 6) to position myself for the apple at (6, 5) while also moving away from the potential collision path with the enemy snake.

It creates vertical distance from the enemy snake\n2. It opens up a path toward the apple at (3, 2)\n3.

The enemy snake has moved to (3, 7) and we're now in the same column again - they're directly above me just 3 spaces away. They're definitely shadowing my movements, which could be a deliberate strategy to limit my options.\n\nAvailable moves from (3, 4):\n- UP to (3, 5) - Safe but gets me closer to the enemy at (3, 7) \n- DOWN to (3, 3) - Safe, creates distance from enemy\n- LEFT to (2, 4) - Safe, gets me out of this column\n- RIGHT to (4, 4) - Can't go here, that's my body\n\nAnalysis of options:\n\nUP to (3, 5): This reduces the gap to just 2 spaces between me and the enemy. If they move DOWN next turn, we could end up in a dangerous face-off situation. Not ideal.\n\nDOWN to (3, 3): This creates more distance but keeps me trapped in the same column as the enemy. They could continue to shadow me vertically.\n\nLEFT to (2, 4): This breaks free from their column control and positions me well. From (2, 4), I'd be well-positioned to continue toward the apple at (2, 7) or pivot toward the apple at (3, 2).\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n- (2, 7) is now quite accessible if I go LEFT - I'd be at (2, 4) and could work my way up\n- (3, 2) is still reachable by going LEFT then working downward\n- The other apples are further away\n\nStrategic thinking: The enemy's shadowing behavior suggests they're trying to control key areas or limit my movement. By going LEFT, I break their pattern and force them to make a choice - continue following me or pursue their own objectives.\n\nLEFT seems optimal because:\n1. Escapes the enemy's column control\n2. Positions me toward multiple apple options\n3. Maintains good maneuverability \n4. Forces the enemy to adapt their strategy\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT to (2, 4), assess the enemy's response. If they continue shadowing, consider making a quick move toward the apple at (2, 7) since I'll be in the right column. If they break away, maintain flexibility to go for the nearest apple.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake has moved to (2, 7) - they're now in the same column as me, just 3 spaces directly above. They're definitely shadowing my movements and trying to control this column. But there's an apple at (2, 9) that's directly above them!\n\nAvailable moves from (2, 4):\n- UP to (2, 5) - Safe, but moves toward the enemy in the same column\n- DOWN to (2, 3) - Safe, creates distance \n- LEFT to (1, 4) - Safe, moves away from enemy\n- RIGHT to (3, 4) - Can't go here, that's my body\n\nAnalysis:\n\nUP to (2, 5): This reduces the gap to just 2 spaces between me and the enemy at (2, 7). However, there's an apple at (2, 9) above them. If I keep moving up and they continue up toward that apple, we could end up in a dangerous head-to-head situation.\n\nDOWN to (2, 3): This creates distance but doesn't capitalize on any immediate opportunities. The apple at (3, 2) would still require some maneuvering.\n\nLEFT to (1, 4): This gets me out of the column standoff and maintains flexibility, but doesn't pursue any immediate apple opportunities.\n\nLooking at the strategic situation: The enemy is between me and the apple at (2, 9). They're likely going to go for that apple since they're closer. If I go UP, I'm essentially following them into a potential trap - they could get the apple, grow longer, and then I'd be stuck behind a longer snake in a narrow column.\n\nThe apple at (3, 2) is actually quite accessible if I go DOWN to (2, 3), then I could go RIGHT to (3, 3) and then DOWN to (3, 2).\n\nStrategy decision: I should go DOWN to create distance from the enemy and position myself to get the apple at (3, 2). This avoids the dangerous column chase scenario and gets me a guaranteed apple opportunity.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (2, 3), move RIGHT to (3, 3) to set up for capturing the apple at (3, 2).

My plan is working exactly as intended. I'm now at (3, 3) and the apple at (3, 2) is just one move DOWN from me. \n\nLet me check my available moves from (3, 3):\n- UP to (3, 4) - Can't go here, that's part of my body\n- DOWN to (3, 2) - This is the apple! Perfect move\n- LEFT to (2, 3) - Can't go here, that's my body (my previous head position)\n- RIGHT to (4, 3) - Safe, but why would I when there's an apple right below me?\n\nThe enemy snake #1 moved to (2, 9) and likely grabbed the apple there, so they probably grew. But that's fine - I'm about to grab my apple too.\n\nThis is exactly the scenario I planned for. Moving DOWN to (3, 2) will:\n1. Give me the apple and 1 point\n2. Grow my snake by 1 segment\n3.

The apple at (7, 0) looks promising since it's away from the enemy snake's likely path. The enemy will probably be in the upper area after getting the apple at (0, 9), so heading toward the bottom-right apple at (7, 0) seems like a good territorial play.\n\nDOWN",

The closest apple appears to be at (7, 4), which is to my right.\n\nMoving RIGHT would start me on a direct path toward this apple. However, I need to be careful about the enemy snake's body at (3, 2), which is below where I'd be heading.\n\nMoving UP to (2, 5) is also safe and would give me more space to maneuver. It's not directly toward the apple, but it provides a safer path.\n\nMoving DOWN to (2, 3) would bring me closer to the enemy snake's body, which could be risky if I need to navigate around it.\n\nI think the best move is RIGHT since it takes me directly toward the nearest apple at (7, 4). There's plenty of space between my current position and that apple, and I can navigate around the enemy snake's body as needed.\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter moving RIGHT, I'll likely continue eastward toward the apple at (7, 4), but will need to navigate around the enemy snake's body by moving up to avoid the segment at (3, 2). I'll also keep track of the enemy's movements to ensure they don't block my path.\n\nRIGHT",

After I collect the apple at (8, 6) in two more moves, I should look at either the apple at (7, 7) which will be very close, or the one at (9, 5).

My strategy is working perfectly - I'm now just 2 moves away from the apple at (8, 6).\n\nFrom position (8, 4), my movement options are:\n- UP to (8, 5) - Safe, clear path continuing directly toward my target apple at (8, 6)\n- DOWN to (8, 3) - Can't go here, that's my body (previous position)\n- LEFT to (7, 4) - This has an apple! But it would deviate from my current efficient path\n- RIGHT to (9, 4) - Safe, open space but moves away from my target\n\nCurrent situation analysis:\n- Apple at (8, 6) - still my primary target, just 2 moves away if I continue UP\n- Apple at (7, 4) - immediately to my left, I could get this one right now\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (5, 4) with a long body, but they're not threatening my current area\n\nStrategic decision:\nThis is interesting - I have a choice between two apples:\n1. Continue UP to get (8, 6) in 2 more moves\n2. Go LEFT to get (7, 4) immediately\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7, 4) is immediately available and would give me a point right now. However, the enemy snake #1 is at (5, 4), which is on the same row. They could potentially move toward that apple at (7, 4) as well.\n\nBut wait - let me check the enemy's position more carefully. They're at (5, 4) and I'm at (8, 4). If I go LEFT to (7, 4), I'd be moving closer to them, and they're only 2 spaces away from that apple too. That could be risky.\n\nThe safer play is to continue with my original plan - go UP to (8, 5), then next turn UP again to (8, 6) for the apple. This keeps me away from the enemy snake and secures a guaranteed point.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After I move to (8, 5), I'll be one move away from the apple at (8, 6). Next turn I should move UP to collect it, then reassess the board for the next target.\n\nUP",

(9, 5) - Very close, just one move RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT\n2. (7, 7) - Close, just LEFT then UP from my current position\n3. (1, 8) and (6, 8) - Further away\n4. (2, 3) - Further away\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7, 4) with a very long body. They don't seem to be heading toward the nearby apples immediately.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- The apple at (9, 5) is very accessible - I could go RIGHT to (9, 6) then DOWN to (9, 5)\n- The apple at (7, 7) is also very accessible - I could go LEFT to (7, 6) then UP to (7, 7)\n- Going UP to (8, 7) puts me closer to the apples at (6, 8) and (7, 7)\n\nI think the most efficient move is to go RIGHT to (9, 6). This positions me perfectly to collect the apple at (9, 5) on my next turn. The apple at (9, 5) seems like the safest and closest target, and getting to the right edge gives me a clear path to it.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (9, 6), I'll move DOWN to (9, 5) to collect that apple.

I'm now at (5, 1) and there's an apple at (5, 2) directly above me. This is exactly what I planned for - I can move UP to collect this apple immediately.\n\nLet me verify this move is safe:\n- UP to (5, 2): This is where the apple is located, so it's definitely not occupied by any snake body\n- The enemy snake #1 is at (2, 9) with its body extending through various positions, but none of its body parts are at (5, 2)\n- This move won't take me into a wall or my own body\n\nThis is a perfect opportunity to score my first point and grow my snake!\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I should reassess the board. The remaining apples will be at:\n- (1, 8) - quite far and near enemy territory\n- (2, 3) - relatively close and accessible\n- (0, 3) - close and on the left edge\n- (7, 9) - far and potentially dangerous\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (5, 2), I'll need to decide on my next target. The apples at (2, 3) and (0, 3) both look promising since they're relatively close and away from the main body of the enemy snake. I should probably head toward (2, 3) or (0, 3) next, but I'll need to be careful about the enemy snake's movement patterns.\n\nUP",

After moving left, I can go DOWN to get closer to this apple.\n- RIGHT moves me away from the closest apple, but gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nSince my immediate goal is to collect more apples, and the apple at (1, 8) is closest, I'll choose LEFT. This starts positioning me to go down and collect that apple on future moves.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving LEFT to (1, 9), I'll plan to move DOWN to approach the apple at (1, 8). Then I'll need to carefully navigate down toward the other apples at the bottom of the board, avoiding trapping myself against my long body. I should be mindful that after collecting the apple at (1, 8), I'll have limited space in that corner and will need to plan my exit route carefully.\n\nLEFT",

Continue LEFT to (3, 2), then LEFT again to (2, 2), then UP to (2, 3)\n2. Go UP to (4, 3), then LEFT twice to reach (2, 3)\n\nBoth paths seem safe.

Wait, that means the enemy snake is exactly where I want to go!\n\nLet me re-examine the board more carefully:\n- Position (0, 4) shows \"1\" which indicates the enemy snake's head\n- Position (1, 4) shows \"0\" which is my current position\n- The apple at (0, 3) is marked as \"A\"\n\nSince the enemy snake head is at (0, 4), I cannot move LEFT to that position as it would mean hitting the enemy snake and dying.\n\nMy safe options are:\n- UP to (1, 5): Safe, leads to open space\n- DOWN to (1, 3): Safe, but doesn't seem optimal\n\nWait, let me check if DOWN to (1, 3) could be a good path to the apple at (0, 3). From (1, 3), I could then go LEFT to (0, 3) and collect the apple directly!\n\nLooking at the board, position (1, 3) appears to be empty (marked as \".\"), and position (0, 3) has the apple. This seems like a viable alternative path to get the apple while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move DOWN to (1, 3), then LEFT to (0, 3) to collect the apple, assuming the enemy snake doesn't block that path.\n\nDOWN",

Fortunately, this is exactly what I want as it will let me eat the apple at (0, 3).\n\nAfter eating this apple, I'll need to be careful.

The enemy snake has boxed me in quite effectively on the left side, and my own body is creating constraints on the right and above. \n\nAfter moving to (1, 1), I'll need to assess my next options.

The enemy snake is currently above me, and I'll need to monitor its movements to avoid getting trapped. Once I have enough space, I might consider moving upward to start making my way toward that apple.\n\nFor the next turn, I should evaluate if moving UP is viable after this move, as that would start my path toward the center of the board.\n\nRIGHT",
