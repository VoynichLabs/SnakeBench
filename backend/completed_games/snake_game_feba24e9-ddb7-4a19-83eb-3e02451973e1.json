No bodies anywhere, both scores 0. Turn 0 \u2014 no insta-deaths on any move. Time to be smart, not reckless. Ready to box him in? Let\u2019s think.\n\nMove-by-move brain dump:\n- UP -> (2,3): safe. Keeps 4 exits next turn ((2,4),(1,3),(3,3),(2,2)). Moves us closer to the opponent (Manhattan distance 4) and keeps access to nearby apple at (1,3) while retaining lots of escape routes. Good central control.\n- DOWN -> (2,1): safe but moves away from opponent and apples. Still plenty of space, but less aggressive.\n- LEFT -> (1,2): safe and gets us nearer to the (1,3) apple; hugs the left side a bit more (fewer escape options than UP but still fine).\n- RIGHT -> (3,2): safe, aligns our x with the enemy (x=3) which could help pressure vertically \u2014 but also could increase head-on risk later if we overcommit and they dive down. We\u2019re tied on apples, so we should avoid forcing an early head-on.\n\nEliminations: none of the moves are instant-death. But we should avoid moves that make a head-on likely on the next couple turns while scores are tied.\n\nDecision: go UP. Why? It closes distance vertically, preserves the most flexible set of follow-up moves, keeps options to contest nearby apples, and positions us to start corralling the opponent toward the top without overcommitting to a head-on right now. Aggressive but safe. \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Continue moving to control center columns and approach the opponent gradually.\n- Avoid committing to a single column that invites a head-on while apples are tied.\n- If the opponent overextends, force them into the walls or collide into our body by shrinking their escape space.\n- Grab apples opportunistically to build a lead; once ahead, play more aggressively for head-on collision.\n\nLet\u2019s pressure \u2019em and keep our escape routes open.

Grabbing the apple now is high-value: it increases the chance we can safely force a head-on later. LEFT is safe this turn and keeps multiple escape options next turns. We avoid foolish early head-on while scores are tied; instead we flip the script by taking the apple.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (1,3) this turn to go up 1-0.\n- Use the extra length/score to pressure and control column near the opponent (move toward x=3 over a couple turns while keeping exits).\n- If opponent overcommits into a wall or narrow space, cut off escape and force collision. If opponent tries a head-on while we\u2019re ahead, we take the trade.\n- Keep escape routes open; don\u2019t get boxed on the edges unless we\u2019ve set the trap.\n\nLEFT",

They cannot go UP (that\u2019d be into their own body).\n- Safe moves for me: UP -> (1,4), DOWN -> (1,2), LEFT -> (0,3).

So avoid moves that let them crash into us immediately.\n- UP (1,4) nudges toward the opponent\u2019s row, keeping pressure and lots of escape routes (LEFT, UP, DOWN available next turn). It doesn\u2019t allow an immediate mutual move into the same cell from the opponent.\n- LEFT (0,3) is safe but drifts to edge and reduces future options \u2014 we don\u2019t want to get boxed early.\n- DOWN (1,2) is passive; it gives them initiative.\n\nDecision & short-term plan:\n- Move UP to stay aggressive, approach their column, and threaten to cut off lateral space over the next 2\u20133 moves while keeping escape routes open.\n- Next turns: watch their tendency (do they chase apples or go right to (4,5)?). If they overcommit toward the wall or an apple, we\u2019ll tighten the corridor and force a mistake. If they try a head-on while we\u2019re still tied, we avoid it; if we get ahead later, we\u2019ll accept trades.\n\nUP",

RIGHT does exactly that \u2014 approaches the enemy, keeps flexibility, and stays central. UP is safe but pulls away; DOWN creates lateral alignment that could invite risky collisions later.\n\nLong-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Push rightward and stay one or two rows above their head to cut off northern escape paths if they commit left/top.\n- Don\u2019t trade heads: only force a head-to-head if we lead on apples (we don\u2019t).\n- If they skitter toward the wall/top, pivot to trap by sealing off their inside escape (use our body + board edges).\n- Grab apples opportunistically if they help seal control, but primary goal = dominate space and box them in.\n\nRIGHT",

If they overcommit toward the wall, pivot to seal exits using our body + board edge.\n- Take apples only if they help box them; growing is a tool to control space, not bait for a mutual KO.\n- Keep at least 2 escape options after each move \u2014 don't get funneled into a corner.\n\nAlright \u2014 time to press the action and make them sweat.

If they go LEFT to (6,9) we can threaten to collapse the corridor next turns; if they go RIGHT to (8,9) they\u2019re forced farther from center and easier to box in later.\n- UP is safe but passive; DOWN is too passive. We want pressure to force mistakes while keeping multiple escape routes.

Time to think fast and smart.\n\nState scan (fast):\n- Our head: (6,8), neck: (5,8) \u2192 LEFT is illegal (would bite our neck).\n- Opp head: (6,9), neck: (7,9) \u2192 their legal moves: LEFT \u2192 (5,9) or DOWN \u2192 (6,8).\n- Board threats: (7,8), (7,7), (6,7) are opponent body; moving into any of those is instant death.\n\nMove-by-move:\n- LEFT \u2192 illegal (back into our neck). No.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8) is occupied by their body and will remain occupied after their move \u2192 instant death. Don\u2019t.\n- UP \u2192 (6,9) is their head. If we go UP and they go DOWN, heads swap into each other\u2019s former cells which become bodies after the move \u2192 mutual death (double KO). If they go LEFT, we move into their former head which becomes their body \u2192 we die outright. Because we\u2019re behind on apples (1 vs 5), forcing a double-KO is losing for us. Avoid UP.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7) is currently their body, and it will stay occupied after they move, so this move is very risky too. However, compared to UP (which promises a likely double-KO if they panic and go DOWN), DOWN avoids the explicit head-swap scenario. It gives us the slimmest chance that they blunder into a self-collision or an apple/growth edge in future turns. It\u2019s the \u201cleast suicidal\u201d pick in a brutal squeeze.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Survive this turn and force them off the top row if possible. Once any gap opens (they move LEFT and we can rotate), pivot to chase down the right side and cut returns.\n- Prioritize keeping at least 2 escape options next turn \u2014 don\u2019t repeat a move that makes us a one-tile target.\n- If anything opens to trap them against the wall without a head-on, we commit. If it gets to mutual-death territory while we\u2019re behind, bail and live to fight another turn.\n\nTime to make the safest call I can in this choke \u2014 we go DOWN.\n\nDOWN",
