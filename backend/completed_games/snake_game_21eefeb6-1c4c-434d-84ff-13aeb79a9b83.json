Given the current position is at (8,8), and previous move was RIGHT, perhaps it's best to assume our snake's head is at (8,8). To clarify, the last move info indicates our snake is now at (8,8), moving RIGHT from (7,8). The body is at [(7,8)], so core position is at (8,8).\n\n- Our snake's head is at (8,8). Moving RIGHT would take us to (9,8). The apple at (3,8) is far away\u2014so my initial assumption of heading toward that apple was a mistake. The apple at (3,8) is to the left, not to the right.\n\n- Let's analyze the actual game board:\n\nFrom the visual, the snake is at (8,8), with the last move being to the RIGHT, so we're at (8,8). The apple at (8,6) is two steps below and to the right is not relevant for current move.\n\nCheck possible moves:\n\n- UP: (8,9) \u2014 within bounds, no immediate obstacle? No snake segments at that position, it appears safe.\n- DOWN: (8,7) \u2014 no obstacle? Seems safe.\n- LEFT: (7,8) \u2014 the snake's body is at (7,8), so moving left would cause collision with itself, which is dangerous.\n- RIGHT: (9,8) \u2014 moving to (9,8); is it safe? No known obstacle, within bounds, safe.\n\nNext, considering the apples:\n\n- Apples are at: (1,1), (5,4), (8,6), (1,3), (1,9).\n\nOur current position is at (8,8). The closest apple towards our current movement options is (8,6), which is two steps down.\n\nGiven the last move was RIGHT and the current position is at (8,8), perhaps moving down could position us closer to apple at (8,6), but first, we have to avoid hazards.\n\nHeremay be best to:\n\n1. Avoid moving into walls or ourselves.\n2. Pursue the apple at (8,6), which is directly below us.\n\nPossible strategic move: move DOWN toward (8,7):\n\n- (8,7) is safe and closer to the apple at (8,6).\n- Moving DOWN now allows us to approach the apple efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,9) is also safe and may be strategic in case the path below gets blocked later, but currently, moving down seems more direct.\n\nAlso, we should note that moving LEFT is dangerous (because it's occupied by our body at (7,8)), and moving RIGHT into (9,8) seems safe but less optimal since moving LEFT is blocked (body at (7,8)), and moving RIGHT might not bring us closer to any apple.\n\nTherefore, the safest, most strategic move is to go DOWN:\n\n- It moves us closer to the apple at (8,6).\n\nFinal considerations:\n\n- Moving DOWN to (8,7): safe, closer to apple, no hazards.\n\nNext move: DOWN.\n\n**Decided next move: DOWN**"

From the board display, this corresponds to the '1' at (8,3), but based on the story, it seems the initial position is at (8,3), and in the provided visualization, the snake's body is at (8,4), (8,5)\u2014so likely the current head is at (8,8). However, the move info states the last move was DOWN, and the head position is now (8,8), with bodies at (8,7), (8,6)\u2014this suggests the snake is moving downward, approaching the apple at (8,6).\n\n- Apple at (8,6). Our snake is currently at (8,8), with body segments at (8,7) and (8,6). Wait: the last move was DOWN, which would move from (8,8) to (8,7). Next move then would be (8,6), where the apple is.\n\n- Coordinates:\n  - Head: (8,8)\n  - Body: (8,7), (8,6)\n\nSince the apple is at (8,6), and the body is occupying (8,6), moving down into (8,6) would result in collision with ourselves, which is unsafe.\n\nHowever, the previous analysis suggested moving down to (8,7) is safe and brings us closer to the apple\u2014assuming the body is at (8,7) and (8,6), i.e., the snake is only two segments long, the body at (8,7) and (8,6), with head at (8,8). `Our last move was DOWN`, then the head was at (8,7)\u2014which conflicts with the previous positions.\n\nGiven the available info, perhaps the snake's current head is at (8,8), with body segments at (8,7) and (8,6). Moving down from (8,8) to (8,7), then to (8,6) will cause a collision with own body if not careful, because (8,6) is occupied by the body.\n\nBut moving down to (8,7) is safe? Wait, the body segments are at (8,7) and (8,6)\u2014so moving down into (8,7) would mean moving into a body segment, which is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, moving down directly to (8,7) or (8,6) is unsafe because these are occupied by the snake's body.\n\nWhat about other directions?\n\n- LEFT: (7,8):\n  - Is it occupied? The only body positions are at (8,7) and (8,6), so (7,8) is free.\n  - Moving left would take us away from the apple at (8,6). Not optimal.\n\n- RIGHT: (9,8):\n  - Free. Moving right moves us away from the apple at (8,6), less desirable.\n\n- UP: (8,9):\n  - Free, but farther away from the apple.\n\nGiven our goal is to reach (8,6) where the apple is, but moving directly down into (8,7) or (8,6) is dangerous because those are occupied by our body, the best move might be to first maneuver around the body to approach the apple from another direction.\n\nPossible strategy:\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,8), then down or right to get closer to the apple, as moving directly down isn't safe due to the body.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Move UP from (8,8) to (8,9). Then, moving left from (8,9) to (7,9), then down to (7,8), etc., to navigate around the body to reach the apple at (8,6).\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nA simpler approach:\n\n- Since the apple is directly below at (8,6), and the snake's body occupies (8,7) and (8,6), moving directly down isn't safe.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (7,8):\n\n  - This is safe and positions us closer to the apple vertically.\n\n- On the next turn, we can plan to move down into (7,7), then right into (8,7), then down into (8,6). But moving into (8,6) again will be unsafe because of the body segment there.\n\nGiven these considerations, the safest move this turn might be to move LEFT to (7,8), gradually maneuvering around the body to reach the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**"
