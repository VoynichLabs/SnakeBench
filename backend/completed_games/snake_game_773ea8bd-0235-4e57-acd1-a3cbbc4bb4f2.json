No bodies for either of us. Apples all over but we focus on boxing the enemy and getting the board control. Ready to bully? \ud83d\ude0f\n\nDecision breakdown (thinking out loud):\n- Possible moves from (4,2): UP -> (4,3), RIGHT -> (5,2), LEFT -> (3,2), DOWN -> (4,1).\n- Immediate-death checks: none of those are off-board or into bodies \u2014 we\u2019re safe to move any direction this turn.\n- Head\u2011on risk this turn: opponent at (6,4) cannot reach any of our four candidate squares in one move, so no instant mutual-kill threat right now.\n- Strategic evaluation:\n  * UP (4,3): moves toward apple at (4,4). Solid, keeps options open, but a bit passive.\n  * RIGHT (5,2): aggressive \u2014 closes x-gap toward the enemy, contests the x=5 column where several apples are (5,1),(5,4),(5,7),(5,8). Gives multiple follow-ups (up to pressure, down for quick apple at 5,1, onward to 6,x to corner him). Best for early board control.\n  * LEFT (3,2): retreats and hands center to opponent \u2014 too passive when we want to dominate.\n  * DOWN (4,1): goes toward lower apple band but less pressure on opponent\u2019s side.\n- Risk/reward: RIGHT is the most aggressive, keeps many escape/follow-up options, and starts to claim the central column to box the opponent later. No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns):\n- Move RIGHT to (5,2) now to seize the central lane. Next turns, contest apples on the 5-column (either grab 5,1 quickly or push up toward 5,4) while using our movement to cut off the opponent\u2019s easy paths. If the opponent commits toward us and we gain an apple advantage, force a head-on; otherwise avoid mutual-kill and use board control to box him into a corner.\n\nAlright fans, let\u2019s make him sweat. What we do now matters.\n\nRIGHT",

Opponent can go DOWN to (5,3) this turn and cause a head-on collision. They\u2019re already ahead 1\u20130, so a mutual KO would hand them the win. We should avoid putting ourselves in a square they can suicide into for a guaranteed victory. No thanks. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (6,2): Safe this turn. Keeps pressure and helps claim the central columns. Aggressive and flexible. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (4,2): Safe but passive. Hands some initiative to them and doesn\u2019t help close the apple gap. Meh. \u26aa\n- DOWN -> (5,1): Safe AND there\u2019s an apple there. We\u2019d pick it up immediately, grow to length 2, and tie the score 1\u20131. That flips the dynamic fast \u2014 now head-on trades become less favorable for them and more negotiable for us. Big value for zero risk. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRisk check & meta:\n- We must avoid moves that enable them to force a suicide-win. UP hands them that; so UP is out.\n- Grabbing the apple DOWN ties the score and gives us body length to start boxing and controlling space. That\u2019s exactly the kind of aggressive economic move we want early.\n- RIGHT keeps more mobility but misses the immediate apple and leaves us down 0\u20131, which is risky versus a savvy opponent.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take (5,1) now to tie apples and grow. Then use our new length to contest the central 5/6 columns, pressure their escape routes, and force them toward walls. Avoid head-on until we hold the apple advantage \u2014 then force the collision.

That flexibility is crucial for boxing maneuvers later.\n- LEFT is tempting to chase apples, but UP preserves more immediate escape lanes and lets us approach the mid-upper apple cluster safely.\n- No opponent head threats nearby, so taking the central-high ground is the play to start corralling them later.\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns:\n- Take UP now to maintain mobility. Next turn pivot LEFT toward x=5\u20136 column to threaten apple clusters at y=6\u20138.\n- Grow on reachable apples to build length, then start hemming the opponent to the left wall if they push downward.\n- Avoid risky head-on trades until we equalize or surpass their apple count \u2014 we want them to run into our body, not us into theirs.\n\nUP",

Do not be that guy. \u274c\n- UP -> (8,5): SAFE. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (8,3): SAFE but LOWER mobility (our left is blocked by our own body at (7,3)). \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT -> (9,4): SAFE but hugs the wall (fewer follow-ups). \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nThreat / collision check:\n- Opponent head at (4,6) \u2014 far left. Their legal moves are up (4,7), down (4,5), or right (5,6). They can\u2019t reach any of our immediate target squares this turn, so no instant head-on threat.\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (4 vs 6), so we should NOT bait a head-on now. We want safe growth and better positioning to CORRAL them later.\n\nWhy UP:\n- Maximizes our immediate follow-up options (from (8,5) we can go UP, RIGHT, or LEFT next turn), keeping escape lanes open. Versatility > edging the board.\n- Avoids hugging the right wall (RIGHT) and avoids the risk of getting funneled by our own body (DOWN).\n- Keeps us closer to the center corridor so we can pivot left on the next turns to pressure x=4\u20136 where the enemy lives. Time to close the net, not sprint into it.\n\nShort-term / long-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- This turn: UP to (8,5) to retain mobility.\n- Next turn: pivot LEFT toward the center (via (7,5) then (6,5)) to gradually corral the opponent into the 4\u20136 corridor.\n- Avoid forcing head-on until we at least tie apples. Use length to block escape lanes; bait them into their own tail or cramped spaces, then collapse.\n- Keep at least one guaranteed escape route until we have the apple advantage to confidently force collision plays. Stay aggressive but don\u2019t suicide.\n\nFinal move:\nUP",

Eating it gives me +1 length and pushes my score even further ahead of snake #0.  \n- Going UP also keeps me away from the tight vertical lane on the left where my own tail is hanging, and it doesn\u2019t put me in immediate danger of running into the opponent\u2019s body.  \n- If I grab that apple, I\u2019ll be positioned at (5,7) which lines up perfectly with the next apple at (5,8).

More aggressive toward the opponent\u2019s corridor (x\u22484\u20136) but reduces next-move options (you\u2019d have only LEFT or UP \u2014 RIGHT would be backwards).

Mobility > raw aggression right now. \ud83e\udd85\n- Keeps us central and ready to pivot left next turn to pressure x=6\u20137 and then slide into the 4\u20136 corridor when it's safer.\n- Avoids wall-hugging and the premature choke that LEFT/RIGHT would risk. We want to corral, not suicide-bait.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- This turn: UP to retain mobility and keep the pivot option.\n- Next: look to pivot LEFT into (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) to start applying pressure, but only if the opponent doesn\u2019t bait a head-on. If they commit into a cramped area, collapse; if they back out, keep central control and eat apples when safe.\n- Stay aggressive but keep one clear escape route until the apple count is tied or higher.

Neck = (8,5) so DOWN is illegal (don\u2019t walk into yourself). Check moves:\n\n- UP -> (8,7): safe, keeps 3 follow-ups (UP/LEFT/RIGHT), stays central, nudges toward apples at (8,8). Conservative, high mobility.\n- LEFT -> (7,6): safe, also has 3 follow-ups (UP/LEFT/DOWN). More aggressive \u2014 moves us toward the opponent\u2019s corridor (x\u22483\u20136) and starts the squeeze.\n- RIGHT -> (9,6): safe this turn but hugs the wall and gives very limited follow-ups (only UP next turn). Too restrictive.\n- DOWN -> (8,5): ILLEGAL (neck).\n\nOpponent head at (5,7) will most likely go for the apple at (5,8) or sidestep; they can\u2019t drop straight into our neck. They\u2019re up on apples (7 vs our 4) \u2014 so we should NOT bait a head-on. We want to pressure, not suicide.\n\nWhy LEFT:\n- Keeps 3 escape options while pushing into their side of the board. That starts collapsing the space around their body line at y=6 (they\u2019ve got segments at 3\u20135,6).\n- More aggressive than UP but not reckless \u2014 still plenty of room to pivot or bail (UP or DOWN from (7,6)).\n- Avoids wall-hugging and preserves ability to box them toward their own body.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- This turn: LEFT to (7,6) to start applying lateral pressure.\n- Next turns: push to (6,6) if safe, then pivot up/down to cut off exits around x=4\u20136 while watching their moves for any bait toward a head-on. Only force a head-on if we ever equal or exceed their apple count.\n- Keep one clear escape route until we can confidently trap them. If they flee toward open space, follow smartly and eat apples only when safe.\n\nLEFT",

Time to THINK like a predator. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc40\n\nState recap (fast): our head (7,6). Neck is (8,6) so RIGHT is illegal. Opponent head (5,8) \u2014 neck (5,7) so they cannot go DOWN. They can go UP (5,9), LEFT (4,8), or RIGHT (6,8). They\u2019re up on apples (8 vs our 4) so NO forced head-on plays unless we equalize.\n\nMove candidates:\n- RIGHT -> illegal (neck). Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- LEFT -> (6,6): aggressive, puts pressure toward their column, but reduces our follow-ups (after moving LEFT we\u2019d have only 2 safe follow-ups: UP or DOWN, LEFT would run into their body at 5,6 and RIGHT would be immediate back into our neck). Risk of getting boxed if we commit too early.\n- DOWN -> (7,5): technically safe this turn, but risky next\u2014many adjacent cells are our own or opponent body (8,5 is our body, 7,4 is our tail). Leaves very few escape routes.\n- UP -> (7,7): safe, high mobility. Keeps multiple exits (can go left, right later, or continue up), stays flexible to react to opponent moves, avoids head-on risk since opponent can\u2019t move into (7,7) in one step from (5,8).\n\nEnemy likely moves: they can\u2019t go down; they may try to move RIGHT toward (6,8) or UP to (5,9). We want to pressure their left corridor without cornering ourselves. We\u2019re behind on apples -> don\u2019t force a head-on KO. Stay aggressive but live to fight.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- This turn: preserve mobility and pressure options \u2014 go UP to (7,7). \ud83d\ude4c\n- Next turns: watch if they drift right/up. If they give us space, pivot LEFT to (6,7) then (5,7) only if it\u2019s safe and not into their body. Try to collapse their accessible area around x=3\u20136 while keeping one clear escape route. If they attempt to bait a head-on, bail out \u2014 we don\u2019t have the apple lead to risk double KO. \ud83c\udf4e\u2696\ufe0f\n\nAlright chat \u2014 play it tight, play it smart, apply pressure but don\u2019t overcommit. Ready? Let\u2019s hit it.\n\nUP",
