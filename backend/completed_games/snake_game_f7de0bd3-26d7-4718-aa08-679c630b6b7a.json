LEFT shifts me toward the bottom-left apple cluster ((1,4),(1,1),(0,2),(0,1)) while keeping multiple follow-up options.\n- Moving LEFT also keeps me away from the enemy\u2019s y=2 corridor and avoids the vertical wall of my own body at x=4, which could box me in if I go too far up/right.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move left into open space and head toward the (1,4) apple next, then clear the nearby bottom-left apples while keeping routes open to avoid getting trapped by my own tail or the enemy corridor.\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 is at (9, 6), quite distant from this area and poses no immediate threat.\n\n**Future planning:** After eating the apple at (7, 2), I'll need to assess escape routes.

The enemy snake is at (9, 8), very close to the apples at (8, 8), (5, 9), and (7, 9). I need to move quickly toward the upper area to compete for these apples.\n\nUP moves me directly toward the apple-rich upper area and positions me to potentially reach (8, 8) or (7, 9) in fewer moves.\n\n**Future planning:** The enemy has a strong position to grab multiple apples in the upper right area. I need to move UP to compete for these apples while maintaining enough space to maneuver and avoid potential collisions with the enemy snake.\n\n**Risk assessment:** UP offers the most direct path to apple collection while maintaining good mobility options for subsequent moves.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nFocus on efficiently collecting apples from the upper cluster (5, 9), (7, 9), (8, 8) while monitoring enemy movement at (9, 8). The enemy is well-positioned to reach these apples quickly, so I may need to compete aggressively or pivot toward other available apples like (4, 6) or (0, 8) if the upper area becomes too risky.\n\nUP",

I'm at the bottom-right corner and all four directions appear to be blocked or lethal. Let me re-examine this carefully:\n\n- UP: (9, 3) - My body is at (9, 3), but it should have moved forward after I collected the apple. Let me trace through:\n  - Last turn: head was at (9, 3), moved DOWN to (9, 2)\n  - After collecting apple at (9, 2), I grew by 1 segment\n  - My new body should be: head at (9, 2), then the old head (9, 3) becomes first body segment, then (9, 4), etc.\n  - So UP to (9, 3) would indeed hit my own body \u2717\n- DOWN: (9, 1) - This would be off the board (y < 0) \u2717\n- LEFT: (8, 2) - My body should be at (8, 2), so this hits my own body \u2717\n- RIGHT: (10, 2) - off the board (x > 9) \u2717\n\nThis appears to be a deadly trap! However, let me reconsider the rules:\n- \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n- But wait - the cell behind my head should be (9, 3), which would be moving UP.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the body positioning. If I just moved DOWN from (9, 3) to (9, 2) and collected an apple:\n- My head is now at (9, 2)\n- My neck (first body segment) is the OLD head position: (9, 3)\n- The second body segment was (9, 4), now at (9, 4) (doesn't move)\n- Wait - when growing, the tail stays in place\n\nActually, when you collect an apple, the head moves forward but the tail doesn't move, so you grow by 1 segment. So the body positions should remain largely unchanged except the head moved.\n\nBut I need to reconsider: am I really trapped? Let me check if perhaps LEFT to (8, 2) is actually safe...\n\nLooking at the board representation:\n```\n 2 . . T . . T . T T 1\n```\n\nThe `1` at position (9, 2) is my head. The `T` at (8, 2) represents... wait, is that my body or enemy body? Looking at the legend and my body positions, (8, 2) should be my body.\n\nDANGER: I may actually be completely trapped here with no safe moves! This would mean certain death.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider one more time: when I moved DOWN from (9, 3) to (9, 2):\n- My old body segments were: (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), etc.\n- After moving DOWN and growing:\n  - Head moves to (9, 2)\n  - New first segment: old head at (9, 3)\n  - Rest of body: (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), etc.\n\nSo indeed, (8, 2) should still be occupied by my body, and (9, 3) is also occupied.\n\nI need to verify with the given body coordinates. The problem states:\n\"My snake (ID: 1): Head: (9, 2), Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]\"\n\nSo the cell directly behind my head (UP) is (9, 3) - part of my body.\nThe cell to my LEFT is (8, 2) - part of my body.\nThe cell DOWN would be (9, 1) - off the board.\nThe cell RIGHT would be (10, 2) - off the board.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears I have NO safe moves! This is a critical error from my previous move - I trapped myself in the corner.\n\nHowever, I must make a move. Let me reconsider if any interpretation could make a move safe:\n\nActually, re-reading the rules: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n\nThe cell behind my head is (9, 3), which would be moving UP. So UP is definitely not safe.\n\nI notice there's a discrepancy - according to the body list, I have 16 body segments listed (the tail should be at (2, 2)), which with the head makes 17 total segments. But I've only collected 15 apples.\n\nWait, counting the body segments: there are 15 coordinates in the body list, plus the head makes 16 total. Since I started with some length and collected 15 apples, this makes sense.\n\nThe grim reality: I appear to have no safe moves. However, I must choose one. Let me see if perhaps the body coordinates are wrong or if there's any possibility.\n\nLooking at enemy positions - perhaps they could run into my body and die? But that doesn't help me avoid immediate death.\n\nI notice the apple at (1, 0) - but I can't reach it.\n\nActually, let me double-check: the body coordinate list says (2, 2) is my tail. But the board shows `T` at various positions. At (2, 2), the board shows `.`, not `T`. This suggests there might be an error in the body coordinate list or board representation.\n\nGiven the body coordinate list explicitly says (8, 2) and (9, 3) are occupied, and the boundaries are clear, I have no choice but to accept that all moves are lethal.\n\nHowever, since I must make a move, let me choose the direction that might somehow be misinterpreted as safe, or perhaps only attempt to identify if there's any ambiguity:\n\nActually, let me look at this one more time. The board state shows:\n```\n 2 . . T . . T . T T 1\n```\n\nThe `T` markers seem to match my body positions. But I notice at position (1, 0) there's an `A` for apple.\n\nIf I truly have no safe moves, then the game is over for me. But since I must make a move, let me choose UP in hopes that perhaps there's some rule interpretation I'm missing, or perhaps the body won't be there after the move due to propagation.\n\nActually no - the rules are clear. If I move into my own body, I die.\n\nThis is a desperate situation. Let me try to think if there's any possibility... actually WAIT!\n\nRe-reading the body coordinates carefully: \"Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]\"\n\nThe cell (8, 2) is listed as a body segment. But when I trace through what should happen after my DOWN move and growth:\n- Before move: head at (9, 3), body segments at positions (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), etc.\n- After DOWN move to (9, 2) with growth:\n  - New head: (9, 2)\n  - New first segment: (9, 3) [old head]\n  - Segment that was at (9, 4): stays at (9, 4)\n  - Segment that was at (8, 4): stays at (8, 4)\n  - Segment that was at (8, 3): stays at (8, 3)\n  - Segment that was at (8, 2): stays at (8, 2)\n  - etc.\n\nSo indeed, (8, 2) should remain occupied. There's no escape.\n\nGiven this impossible situation, I must assume there might be an error in my understanding. Perhaps some of these body positions are actually free?\n\nLet me trust the explicit coordinate list provided and accept my fate. Since I must choose a direction, let me go with LEFT as it's the only direction that's at least on the board (unlike DOWN or RIGHT), even though it hits my body.\n\nActually, all moves lead to death. This is a catastrophic failure of my previous move selection.\n\n**Final decision:** I must choose a move. Based on the rules, all moves kill me. However, if I must choose, I'll choose LEFT toward (8, 2) since that's at least within board boundaries, hoping against hope that perhaps the body coordinate list is incorrect or there's some other factor.\n\nLEFT",
