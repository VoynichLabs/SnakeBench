They're pulling ahead! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- We're at (4,9) with 1 apple\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (2,5) with body at (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), and 3 apples (they're dominating!)\n- We're stuck against the top wall at (4,9) - limited mobility!\n- Board has apples at (6,9) and (5,9) up top - we need to reach them!\n\n**Safe Moves Check:**\n- DOWN to (4,8): Safe! No body there, on board\n- LEFT to (3,9): Safe! No body there, on board  \n- RIGHT to (5,9): Safe! No body there, on board\n- UP to (4,10): DEAD! Off the board!\n\nWe're trapped against the top wall! All three remaining moves are safe for now.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- Enemy has 3 apples (WAY ahead!)\n- We need to start eating apples ASAP to catch up\n- (5,9) has an apple RIGHT THERE - let's go get it!\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,9) gets us an apple AND keeps us against the wall (safe positioning)\n- This also boxes in the enemy a bit by controlling more top territory\n\n**My Plan:** Let's go get that apple at (5,9)! Move RIGHT to secure the apple and maintain our wall position. This catches us up in score while keeping us safe. We're coming back!\n\nRIGHT",
