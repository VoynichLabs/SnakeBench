Taking it gives an immediate point and grows me to length 2 (head at (3,7), tail at (3,8)).\n- Other nearby apples: (2,9) and (5,8) are distance 2; (4,7) is also distance 2. Grabbing the apple at (3,7) keeps multiple follow-up options available (I can go toward the small cluster around (2,9)/(5,8)/(4,7)) and does not trap me.\n- No enemy can contest (3,7) this turn, so it's safe to take.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move DOWN to eat (3,7).

Moving RIGHT to (1,7) puts me on a direct route: (1,7)->(1,8)->(1,9).\n- From (1,7) I will still have the option to go up to the apples or right into more open space (2,7) if needed; moving UP to (0,8) pins me to the wall a bit more and reduces lateral flexibility.\n- Enemy is focused low on the board; staying toward the top-left and moving toward those apples keeps me clear of contest and preserves escape routes around my own body.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT to (1,7), then UP to (1,8) and UP to (1,9) to collect apples.\n- After collecting, reassess and avoid entering tight corridors near my own body; prefer routes that keep at least two exit options.\n\nDecision: RIGHT",

That keeps more flexibility and directly accesses the nearby apple at (1,9).\n- Enemy head (6,0) is far away and unlikely to contest the top-left apples in the next few turns, so taking the apple is low-risk.\n- I already lead on apples (11 vs 5); picking up safe apples while maintaining escape routes is the priority.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (1,8), then collect (1,9) on the following turn.

(UP would be off board, LEFT to (0,9) is available). From (1,9) I avoid getting boxed in because I can move back right into open area toward x=2\u20134 and the cluster of apples (2,9),(4,8).

RIGHT is reasonable but forfeits the immediate apple and gives me slightly fewer short-term options than taking (1,9) now.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (1,9) this turn (take apple), then aim for (2,9) and (4,8) while keeping routes open to the right/down so I can avoid trapping along the left edge or my own body.

From (3,8) I will still have two or three follow-up options (2,8), 4,8 (apple), 3,7). However moving down starts to bring me closer to the dense part of my own body (rows 6\u20134), which could reduce maneuvering room in a few turns.\n- RIGHT to (4,9) is safe and heads directly toward the nearby top apples at (5,9) and also keeps (4,8) reachable. From (4,9) my non-backwards choices are RIGHT -> (5,9) (apple) or DOWN -> (4,8) (apple). Although UP is off-board, I still have two good forward options and I remain on the open top row where escape routes (6,9) and 5,8 afterwards are available. The enemy is down near x\u22489,y\u22480 and poses no immediate head-on threat.\n\nChoice rationale:\n- Prefer moves that quickly secure apples while keeping multiple escape routes. RIGHT moves me toward (5,9) this turn/next turn with minimal risk of getting boxed in by my own body. DOWN would also reach an apple but nudges me toward my own winding body sooner.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Take (5,9) (or (4,8) if needed) over the next 1\u20132 turns, then sweep back toward the center/top-right (keeping options open toward (6,9) and (5,8)). Avoid moving into the x=0\u20132 corridor where much of my body lies to prevent getting trapped.\n\nRIGHT",

Dropping down from the top-right later gives clean access to the cluster of apples around (7,7),(8,7),(7,6),(7,5) without immediately entering my own tight coil. The enemy head is far at (8,3) and unlikely to force a head-on on the top row this turn.\n- Avoiding the left/mid coil now preserves long-term maneuvering room and reduces the chance of self-entrapment.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT to (7,9) to stay on the open top edge.\n- From there, evaluate enemy movement; if safe, continue RIGHT to (8,9)/(9,9) or drop DOWN to (7,8) then (7,7) to take the local cluster of apples near x=7\u20138.\n- Avoid diving into the x=0\u20134 coil until I have a clear corridor or the coil has opened up (tail has moved), preserving safety and flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

Taking the apple at (7,7) also positions me to collect the nearby cluster (7,6), (7,5), (8,7) while retaining escape routes (6,7/6,8/8,8).\n- I must be mindful that growing means my tail won't move this turn, so I should avoid entering narrow coils; however there is sufficient space around (7,7)/(7,6)/(7,5) to collect a few apples without immediate self-trap.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (7,7) now, then (7,6)/(7,5) and optionally (8,7) as available, while watching enemy moves toward lower apples like (7,1).\n- Avoid drifting into the tightly coiled area on x=0\u20134 until my tail opens more space.\n- Keep lateral escape options (6,x or 8,x) open to prevent being funneled into a trap.\n\nMove:\nDOWN",

Grabbing (7,6) now keeps me centrally positioned and makes it easy to continue down the cluster while watching the enemy\u2019s slow approach from the bottom.\n- Taking (8,7) is also attractive (and would allow moving up to (8,8)), but pursuing the vertical cluster keeps me in control of the corridor at x=7 where I can collect multiple apples quickly and avoid getting funneled into my own coiled area on the left.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Eat (7,6) this turn, then continue to (7,5) and (7,4) as safe follow-ups, while monitoring the enemy\u2019s movement. After collecting that column I\u2019ll pivot horizontally (preferably right toward the 8,x apples) if the space is open, or backtrack along open cells if needed to avoid tight traps.\n\nMove:\nDOWN",

RIGHT keeps multiple follow-up moves (up into (8,6) apple, then up again into (8,7)/(8,8)), collects several apples safely, and avoids getting funneled between my own body and the enemy.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Move to (8,5) now, then up to (8,6) to take that apple, continue up the (8,7)/(8,8) apples as available, and then reassess for safe exits along the top/right, always avoiding moves that run into my own coil or the enemy\u2019s body.\n\nRIGHT",

No opponent is contesting the immediate apple at (8,7).\n- UP gets me an apple now and keeps me on a short, safe run to (8,8) and then (9,8). That cluster yields points while leaving exits along the top/right edge.\n- RIGHT to (9,6) is safe but delays apple collection and moves me along the board edge with fewer immediate apples; it offers fewer high-value follow-ups.\n- Moving UP does increase my length and slightly reduces the option to go back down (since that square becomes body), but I will still have routes via (8,8) and (9,7)/(9,8) to avoid being boxed by my own coil.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- UP to take (8,7) now, then proceed to (8,8) and (9,8) if available, collecting the top/right cluster.\n- After the cluster, avoid getting trapped by my left-side coil: prefer to keep to the top/right corridor and then sweep down the right side or across the top maintaining multiple escape options.\n- Watch enemy head for any unexpected push into the middle; give priority to safe apple runs and maintaining space.\n\nUP",

Growing by one is acceptable here because I still have room along the top/right corridor.\n- UP is safer than moving into my body but is more constraining (effectively a forced move to 9,9 next turn), which risks reducing flexibility and could lead to being hemmed in later.\n- Enemy head (4,4) is far and cannot contest these top-right apples or cause a head-to-head this turn.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Take (9,8) now, then choose between (9,9) and (9,7) depending on whether I want to sweep the top row or descend to pick apples below.

That creates a forced one-way move next turn and sets up a possible race with the enemy for (7,4).\n- DOWN -> (9,3) is empty and gives me more escape options over the next few turns (I can continue down the right edge and later head left into the lower apples). It is not immediately contested by the enemy head.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- LEFT would let me reach apple (7,4) in two moves but it also creates a forced move next turn. The enemy head at (6,5) could try to move DOWN then RIGHT to contest (7,4) on the next turn and cause a head-on collision. The enemy would be suicidal to force that outcome (they have far fewer apples), but I should avoid putting myself in a forced, contestable line if a safer option exists.\n- DOWN keeps multiple follow-up options and avoids immediate single-cell bottleneck or forcing a collision.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Continue down the right edge to y\u22481\u20130 while monitoring the enemy head. Once low, cut left toward bottom apples (e.g., (6,0), (6,6) later if safe).\n- Avoid entering narrow corridors where my only move is toward a contested apple; prefer paths that keep at least two safe exits each turn.\n- Watch for enemy trying to approach from left/top; do not get boxed by my long body.\n\nDOWN",

Moving there is moving backwards into myself and is illegal.\n- LEFT -> (7,2) is occupied by the enemy body (snake #1 has a segment at (7,2)). Moving into it would be immediate death, so illegal.\n- RIGHT -> (9,2) is occupied by my own body (I have a segment at (9,2)), so this is illegal.\n- UP -> (8,3) is the only legal move. (8,3) is unoccupied and no enemy head is close enough to contest it this turn, so there is no head-on collision risk now.\n\nSafety and tactical assessment:\n- UP is forced and safe this turn. The enemy head is at (4,8) and cannot reach (8,3) this turn. Moving up preserves escape options (I can continue north or veer left later once space opens).\n- I just ate last turn, so my tail may not move this turn; I must avoid self-collisions in subsequent moves by not getting trapped against my own body along the right wall.\n- Primary short-term goal: move up to (8,3) and then evaluate whether to continue north to find open space or circle back toward the central/bottom apples (e.g., (6,0),(3,0),(2,0)) once I have room. Avoid hugging the right edge where my body and the board edge reduce maneuverability.\n\nShort-term plan for next few turns:\n- Take UP now. On the next turn reassess: prefer paths that increase available empty neighbors (avoid moving into narrow corridors or into squares adjacent to enemy head if it comes closer). Try to move toward more open space (center or bottom-left) rather than getting locked against my own body on the right edge.\n\nUP",

That would funnel me tightly along my existing body on the right and reduce my future freedom.\n- LEFT -> (7,3) is legal and safer. From (7,3) I can access (7,4) (apple) or continue into open center/left (e.g., (6,3)) to reach the many apples clustered on the left/bottom. The enemy head (3,8) is far away and not an immediate threat. Moving left also avoids being hemmed against my own long body on the right edge.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move LEFT now to open up options toward the center and left-side apples (e.g., head for (7,4) then down/left toward the cluster around x=2 and the bottom row). Avoid hugging the right wall where my body creates tight corridors. Reassess after 1\u20132 turns to avoid collisions with the enemy\u2019s maneuvers.\n\nLEFT",

That could be cramped if the enemy shifts unpredictably; it doesn't get me closer to the dense apple cluster on the left/bottom.\n- DOWN -> (6,2) is empty and moves toward the bottom apples (including (6,0)), but its lateral exits are partially blocked (left/down lead into enemy body segments at (5,2) and (6,1) respectively), leaving only RIGHT (toward my previous neck area) as a clean escape route.\n- LEFT -> (5,3) is empty, moves me toward the contested apple cluster on the left, and preserves multiple future options (up, left, or down depending on how the enemy shifts). It keeps distance from the enemy head and avoids getting funneled against my own long tail on the right.\n\nChoice reasoning\n- No immediate head-on threat from the enemy head at (2,7) \u2014 they're far enough that I won't collide this turn.\n- UP is safe but less useful strategically (adjacent to enemy body and not toward the main apple cluster).\n- DOWN would push me into a more boxed corridor with enemy segments blocking key exits.\n- LEFT keeps the most open follow-up moves while advancing toward the apples around x=2 and the bottom row. It also avoids hugging my own long body on the right and reduces the chance of getting trapped against my own segments.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns)\n- Move LEFT now to (5,3).\n- Then aim to sweep left/down toward the apple cluster around x=2 and the bottom row (3,0),(2,0),(6,0),(2,1),(1,2) etc., contesting the enemy for those high-value apples while keeping lateral escape routes open.\n- Avoid moves that push me next to the enemy\u2019s body segments or into narrow corridors along my own tail; prioritize maintaining at least two safe exits each turn.\n\nLEFT",

That will grow me by 1 (tail will not move this turn). From (7,4) my only legal move will again be RIGHT to (8,4) (also an apple). Eating that second apple will again prevent the tail from moving, and after that I'll be boxed in: (9,4), (8,5), and (8,3) are currently occupied by my body, leaving no escape from (8,4) on the subsequent turn. So this sequence likely results in being trapped a couple turns from now.\n- There is no alternative this turn \u2014 I must take the apple at (7,4). After moving, I will monitor enemy movement closely; if the enemy moves into positions that change the collision calculus (e.g., they die or open a corridor by some rare interaction), I will adapt. But given the current layout, the sequence RIGHT -> RIGHT is forced.\n\nLong-term note to self:\n- This region on the right edge is very tight; avoid getting pushed further into corners in future games. When I have long right-side coils, prioritize exits before committing to apples directly adjacent to my head unless escape routes remain.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is far away (head at (2,2)), so no chance of displacing my body or creating an opening.\n\nShort plan / note to future self:\n- Avoid eating apples that force growth when all neighboring cells are body-occupied. Always keep at least one escape cell available before taking clustered apples. In tight coils near the wall, prioritize leaving a corridor or don't grow until an exit is available.\n\nGiven there is no safe option, I will pick a move (resulting in inevitable death this turn).\n\nRIGHT",
