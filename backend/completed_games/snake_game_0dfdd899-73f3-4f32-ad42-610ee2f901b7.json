DOWN \u2013 Moving from (1,8) to (1,7) would bring me closer to the closest apple by Manhattan distance. (For example, the nearest apple is at (2,1): from (1,8) the distance is 1 + 7 = 8; from (1,7) it would be 1 + 6 = 7.) However, enemy snake #0\u2019s head sits at (1,5). Staying in column 1 means I\u2019ll be following directly in its vertical path. If enemy snake #0 later moves upward (say, to (1,6)), I could run into it on a future move.\n\n2. LEFT \u2013 Moving from (1,8) to (0,8) keeps me safe immediately; there\u2019s no snake or wall there. Although the Manhattan distance to our target apple (2,1) increases slightly (|2\u20130| + |1\u20138| = 2+7 = 9 instead of 8), moving LEFT takes me away from the enemy\u2019s column. This gives me more flexibility later to approach the apple (or another target) while avoiding a head-on contest with enemy snake #0.\n\n3. UP \u2013 Moving to (1,9) would only increase my distance from the apples and doesn\u2019t provide any defensive benefit.\n\nIn balancing progress with safety, I prefer not to keep following in the enemy snake\u2019s column. So today my plan is to move LEFT, then in subsequent turns I can work on a path downward that avoids the enemy\u2019s most likely moves while still keeping an eye on the apples.\n\nThus, my decided next move is: LEFT."
