The last move didn't specify a direction, but since it's at (8, 5), it could move in any direction, provided it doesn't collide with walls, apples, or enemies.\n\n- Apples are at (4, 5), (3, 8), (4, 6), (6, 7), and (1, 7).\n\n- The snake's current position is (8, 5), which is relatively close to the apple at (4, 5), but there's a lot of space in between\u2014specifically, between x=8 and x=4, and y=5.\n\n- The closest apple horizontally, (4, 5), is to the left.\n\n- The apple at (3, 8) is further away, and at the top-left, which might be more challenging to reach and can risk running into walls or enemies.\n\n- The apples at (4, 6) and (6, 7) are also nearby, with (4, 6) just above (8, 5), meaning moving up could be a good starting point.\n\n- Moving up from (8, 5) to (8, 6): there's no obstacle directly in that path, but do I have the space? (8, 6) is free. Continuing upward, (8, 7)\u2014checking if any enemy is nearby.\n\n- Enemy snake at (5,7): it's to the left and slightly above, so moving up keeps me safe from a collision with the enemy.\n\n- Also, moving up creates a path toward the apple at (4, 6) by moving diagonally left-up, but since snake moves in orthogonal directions, I need to consider better options.\n\n- Moving left from (8, 5): to (7, 5), then upward, but I have no body segments, so my options are unconstrained.\n\nGiven all this, moving up seems safe and offers direct access to the apple at (4, 6), which is just above and slightly to the left. Alternatively, moving left could directly go toward (4, 5)\u2014which is an apple.\n\nConsidering the proximity:\n\n- Moving left from (8, 5) to (7, 5): safe, then potentially left again or up.\n\n- Moving up from (8, 5) to (8, 6): also safe, and closer to the apple at (4, 6), but would require multiple moves.\n\nSince the apple at (4, 5) is directly to the left, and my position at (8,5), moving LEFT seems logical to quickly reach the apple. Moving left now to (7,5), then to (6,5), and so on, eventually retrieving apples.\n\nIs moving left safe from walls or enemies? (7,5): free. (6,5): free. (5,5): free.\n\nAlternatively, moving up seems safe, too, with a potentially better chance to find a route toward other apples.\n\nBut, because the closest apple is at (4, 5), directly to the left, it makes sense to move LEFT straight away, to get to that apple efficiently.\n\nAnd since the snake's body isn't present, this seems straightforward.\n\nNext, I will decide to move LEFT.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

Moving left now positions us at (5, 5), which is one step away from the apple at (4, 5).\n- However, moving directly onto (4, 5) would be two moves away if we continue going left, so it's better to move left now to get closer to that apple in subsequent turns.\n- Moving upward or downward seems less efficient at this moment since they do not bring us closer to the nearest apple at (4, 5). Moving right is away from the closest apple and doesn't offer immediate benefits.\n- Enemy at (5, 7) is two rows ahead; moving left won't risk collision with it now, as our immediate move is to (5, 5), which is clear.\n- Potential future strategy: consider moving upward after reaching (4, 5) to reach apples at (4, 6) or at (3, 8). But now, focusing on the immediate goal, moving left seems optimal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving left from (6, 5) to (5, 5) is safe, brings us closer to the apple at (4, 5), and sets up a progression toward it.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

Our focus should be on the closest or most accessible apple.\n\n- The apple at (3,8) is directly to the left of our current head at (4,8). Since we are at (4,8), moving LEFT will land us onto (3,8), which is an apple.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (3,8) would result in us eating an apple immediately, gaining a point, and extending our snake.\n\n- This seems like a straightforward, safe move: moving LEFT. \n\n- Moving UP or RIGHT is less immediate but could be options if the left is unsafe. Moving DOWN isn't beneficial for now, as it moves away from the apple.\n\nConsidering the positions:\n- Moving LEFT: (4,8) \u2192 (3,8), which contains an apple and no immediate threats.\n- Moving RIGHT: (4,8) \u2192 (5,8): empty cell.\n- Moving UP: (4,8) \u2192 (4,9): contains an apple at (4,9), so this could also be a plan in future.\n- Moving DOWN: (4,8) \u2192 (4,7): where the snake's own body is, so unsafe.\n\nGiven this, the best move now appears to be LEFT to immediately eat the apple at (3,8).\n\nStrategically, eating this apple puts us closer to escape routes and may open options to reach other apples later, especially the one at (4,9).\n\nTherefore, I'll decide to move LEFT.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

The last move was presumably UP, but given the position, it seems our snake is near the top of the board. Actually, based on the diagram, the snake's head is at (4, 8), and the body is behind at (4, 7) and (4, 6), so moving UP again would be to (4, 9), which contains an apple.\n\n- Our current position is at (4, 8), with an apple directly above at (4, 9). Moving UP would effectively consume that apple and extend the snake.\n\n- Alternatively, moving LEFT would take us to (3, 8), where there is an apple at (3, 8)\u2014but looking at the diagram, (3,8) does not seem to contain an apple, so moving LEFT wouldn't immediately benefit us unless it's empty.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 8) seems empty and might be advantageous if planning to reach more apples later.\n\n- Moving DOWN would be to (4, 7), which is occupied by the snake's body\u2014so unsafe.\n\nSo, potential moves:\n- UP: (4, 8) to (4, 9), which has an apple. Right now, that seems to be the optimal choice as it directly eats an apple, extending the snake.\n\n- LEFT: (4, 8) to (3, 8), which, based on the diagram, appears to be empty.\n\n- RIGHT: (4, 8) to (5, 8), which appears to be empty or safe.\n\n- DOWN: (4, 8) to (4, 7): occupied, unsafe.\n\nSince the apple at (4, 9) is directly above the head, moving UP will immediately grant us a point and grow the snake. Additionally, moving UP reduces risk as it\u2019s an immediate apple.\n\nHowever, considering future plans, moving UP may block access toward other apples, but immediate gain takes precedence.\n\nPotential threats:\n- Moving UP to (4, 9): The cell is occupied by an apple; the move is safe assuming no obstruction or enemy snake at that cell.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (3,8): Not containing an apple, so less beneficial now.\n\n- Moving RIGHT: Seems safe, but less immediate benefit.\n\n- Moving DOWN: unsafe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to maximize immediate gain.\n\nNext move: UP",
