            "rationale": "# Analysis\n\nI need to assess the current game state:\n\n- My snake's head is at (1, 4) with body at [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]\n- Enemy snake #2 is at position (3, 0) with no body segments\n- Apples are at: (1, 7), (7, 2), (8, 3), (8, 2), (5, 0)\n\nLet me check my possible moves:\n- UP: Would move to (1, 5), which is valid\n- DOWN: Would move to (1, 3), which is valid\n- LEFT: Would move to (0, 4), which is valid\n- RIGHT: Would move to (2, 4), which is my own body segment - INVALID (would die)\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 7), which is 3 units away (no horizontal movement, UP 3).\n\n# Strategy\n\nI should avoid moving RIGHT as that would immediately kill me by running into my own body.\n\nMy previous plan was to head towards the apple at (1, 7), and I'm now in a good position to continue that plan by moving UP. This apple is the closest one and gives me a clear path to grow.\n\nThe enemy snake is far away at (3, 0) and not an immediate threat.\n\nMoving UP is clearly the best choice because:\n1. It continues my path toward the closest apple at (1, 7)\n2. It keeps me away from the enemy snake\n3. It doesn't risk trapping myself\n\nFor my next turn, I'll plan to continue moving UP toward the apple at (1, 7). After I reach that apple, I'll need to decide whether to head right toward the cluster of apples or continue exploring the left side of the board.\n\nUP"
