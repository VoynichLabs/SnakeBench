Check for immediate self-collision (including moving backwards):**\nMy snake is only 1 segment long (just the head), so the only way to hit myself is moving off the board, which is handled below.\n\n**2. Check for moving off the board:**\n*   UP to (7, 10) -> DEAD.\n\n**3. Check for collisions with Enemy Snake #0 (Head at (2, 5), Body: none):**\nIf I move to a cell that Snake #0 moves into, or if Snake #0 moves into my target cell, we need careful checking. Since all moves happen simultaneously, the threat comes from Snake #0 moving to my target cell or me moving to Snake #0's cell.\n\n*   **Potential Moves and Target Cells:**\n    *   DOWN to (7, 8)\n    *   LEFT to (6, 9)\n    *   RIGHT to (8, 9)\n\n*   **Enemy Snake #0's Potential Moves (from (2, 5)):**\n    Snake #0 is also 1 segment long. Its tail/back is irrelevant.\n    *   UP: (2, 6)\n    *   DOWN: (2, 4)\n    *   LEFT: (1, 5)\n    *   RIGHT: (3, 5)\n    Since Snake #0 has no strategic information from last turn, it might move randomly or towards an apple. We must assume it picks a safe move.\n\n**Evaluating Target Cells vs. Enemy Head Movement:**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 8):**\n    *   Is (7, 8) occupied by Snake #0's head (2, 5)? No.\n    *   Will Snake #0 move into (7, 8)? No, its potential moves are (2, 6), (2, 4), (1, 5), (3, 5).\n    *   Is (7, 8) an apple? No.\n    *   *Safety Check:* (7, 8) is safe from immediate collision.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 9):**\n    *   Is (6, 9) occupied by Snake #0's head (2, 5)? No.\n    *   Will Snake #0 move into (6, 9)? No.\n    *   Is (6, 9) an apple? No.\n    *   *Safety Check:* (6, 9) is safe from immediate collision.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 9):**\n    *   Is (8, 9) occupied by Snake #0's head (2, 5)? No.\n    *   Will Snake #0 move into (8, 9)? No.\n    *   Is (8, 9) an apple? No.\n    *   *Safety Check:* (8, 9) is safe from immediate collision.\n\n**4. Strategy Consideration:**\nI am at (7, 9), the top right corner. I have two adjacent safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT) and one safe move DOWN. The UP move is deadly.\n\nMy goal is to reach an apple.\nAvailable Apples: (1, 6), (6, 8), (1, 7), (8, 4), (0, 2).\n\n*   **Target (6, 8):** This is 1 step LEFT and 1 step DOWN from my current position (if I could move diagonally).\n    *   LEFT moves me to (6, 9). This brings me closer to the X coordinate of (6, 8), but I am now higher up.\n    *   DOWN moves me to (7, 8). This keeps me closer to the Y coordinate of (6, 8).\n\n*   **Target (8, 4) / (1, 6) / (1, 7) / (0, 2):** These are significantly further away, mostly requiring me to move away from the top edge first.\n\nSince I am at the edge (Y=9), moving LEFT or RIGHT maintains my Y position, keeping me on the safe top row (or moving me one step closer/further from others on that row). Moving DOWN puts me closer to most apples relative to Y, but also further away from the corner.\n\nThe closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance *that is reachable by a safe move* is (6, 8).\n\n*   If I move **DOWN to (7, 8)**: Distance to (6, 8) reduces by 1 (Manhattan distance becomes 2).\n*   If I move **LEFT to (6, 9)**: Distance to (6, 8) remains 2 (1 move left, 1 move down needed next turn).\n\nMoving DOWN to (7, 8) seems strategically sound as it immediately reduces my vertical distance to the closest apple at (6, 8) without significantly compromising my position. It keeps the area near the head relatively open, as I am not boxing myself in against the wall. Snake #0 is far away at (2, 5).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Head towards the closest apple (6, 8) via (7, 8). Future safe moves from (7, 8) are likely (6, 8) (eating the apple), (7, 7), or (8, 8).\n\n**Decision:** Move DOWN to (7, 8).\n\nI consider moving DOWN to (7, 8). This is safe. It brings me closer to the apple at (6, 8) (MD: 2) by reducing the Y difference to 1. Moving LEFT to (6, 9) keeps the MD at 2. Moving DOWN is slightly more proactive towards that specific target.\n\nDOWN",

Its body is now (2, 6) -> (2, 5).\n\n**1. Analyze current state and immediate threats:**\n*   **My Head:** (7, 8). **My Body:** (7, 9). I cannot move UP to (7, 9) as it's my tail/body. (Wait, since I just moved DOWN, (7, 9) is now my tail segment that I just vacated, *unless* I grew. I did not grow because I did not eat an apple. Therefore, moving UP to (7, 9) *is* moving backward into my tail, which is fatal).\n*   **Enemy Head (E0):** (2, 6). **Enemy Body (E0):** (2, 5).\n\n**2. Potential Moves from (7, 8):**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 9):** Moves into my tail. **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 7):** Safe move.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 8):** Moves onto Apple A. **EAT APPLE, GROW.**\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Safe move.\n\n**3. Collision Check (vs E0 at (2, 6)):**\nThe enemy is far away, so moving to any safe cell will not result in an immediate collision (head-on or body threat) this turn, as their potential moves (e.g., (2, 7), (2, 5), (1, 6), (3, 6)) do not overlap with my viable target cells ((7, 7), (6, 8), (8, 8)).\n\n**4. Strategic Goal: Eat Apple (6, 8)**\nThe apple at (6, 8) is directly adjacent to my head at (7, 8). Moving LEFT will consume it.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 8):**\n    *   I eat the apple. Score +1. My new body will be (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 9).\n    *   This is the highest priority move as it increases my score and length, making me safer.\n\n**5. Rationale Summary:**\nThe move LEFT directly reaches the closest apple at (6, 8). This is the best possible move, as eating an apple is paramount when available and safe. The move is safe because (6, 8) is an apple, not occupied by the enemy, and moving into it is permissible. The move UP would be fatal as (7, 9) is now my tail (since I did not grow last turn).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure the next closest apple. The remaining apples are: (1, 6), (1, 7), (8, 4), (0, 2). The next closest seems to be (8, 4) or perhaps moving towards the cluster near (1, 6)/(1, 7). Given I just moved left, continuing generally towards these targets seems reasonable, but after eating (6, 8), my path will dictate the next move. For now, focus on the immediate gain.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLong-Term Plan: Eat the apple at (6, 8) by moving LEFT. If successful, my new head will be at (6, 8) and my body will be (7, 8) -> (7, 9). I will then assess the next closest apple, likely (8, 4) or (1, 6)/(1, 7).\n\nLEFT",

Target Evaluation:**\nThe nearest apple is (1, 7) or (2, 4).\n*   Distance to (1, 7): Manhattan distance = $|6-1| + |8-7| = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n*   Distance to (2, 4): Manhattan distance = $|6-2| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8$.\n*   Distance to (7, 4): Manhattan distance = $|6-7| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5$. **(7, 4) is the closest apple.**\n\n**4. Strategic Move Selection (Aiming for (7, 4)):**\nTo reach (7, 4) from (6, 8) in minimal turns, the path is likely:\n(6, 8) -> (7, 8) [Hit Body - FATAL] OR (6, 8) -> (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 4). This path seems long.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (6, 7)**:\nNew position (6, 7). Next move could be Right to (7, 7) or Down to (6, 6).\nIf E0 moves towards the apples on the right side (e.g., toward (7, 4) or (8, 4)), I need to be quick. E0 is currently aimed left/up.\n\nIf I move **UP to (6, 9)**:\nThis moves away from all current apples, which is generally poor strategy unless necessary for safety.\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (5, 8)**:\nThis also moves away from the nearest apple (7, 4).\n\nThe move **DOWN to (6, 7)** seems most promising for making progress towards (7, 4) while remaining safe. It keeps the option open to move RIGHT next turn (7, 7), getting closer to (7, 4) without hitting my body segment at (7, 8).\n\n**5. Collision Check (vs E0 at (2, 7)):**\nE0 is very far (distance $\\sim 10$). No immediate collision threat. E0's likely next move is UP (to 2, 8) or toward the cluster of apples near (1, 7) by moving LEFT/DOWN if they perceive I am moving towards the right side. Moving DOWN keeps me centralized enough.\n\n**6. Rationale Summary:**\nThe only move that allows forward progress towards the closest apple ((7, 4)) is DOWN to (6, 7) because moving RIGHT hits my tail segment (7, 8). Moving UP is stagnant path-wise. DOWN sets up a better approach vector in the next turn.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move towards apple (7, 4) via (6, 7) then (7, 7) next turn. Once (7, 4) is eaten, re-evaluate distance to (8, 4) or the left cluster ((1, 7), (0, 2)). Avoid collisions with E0, which currently seems focused on the left/top side.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

(Note: The board description in the prompt had E0 at (1, 7) and my head at (6, 8) initially, but the rationale section modified this based on assumed simultaneous action correction).\n\nLet's strictly use the provided current snapshot for Turn 4:\n\n**Current State (Turn 4 Start):**\n*   **Board State Mapping:**\n    *   A: (0, 2), (2, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4). (Apple at (1, 7) is missing, likely eaten by E0 or me previously, or the board layout is slightly mismatching the apple list. (1, 7) is $A$ in the board map provided in the rationale for turn 3 END, but it is NOT listed in the Turn 4 start apple list: (8, 4), (0, 2), (7, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2)).\n    *   0 (E0): Head at (1, 7), Body at (1, 6), (2, 6).

(Score 1)\n\n**CRITICAL DISCREPANCY:** The provided start-of-turn data (Turn 4) is highly inconsistent with the end-of-turn data provided in the RATIONALES for Turn 3.\n\n**Reconciling to the *MOST RECENT* fully defined state (End of Turn 3 Rationale):**\n*   My Move: DOWN to (6, 7).\n*   My Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)]. Score 2.\n*   E0 Move: Unknown, but likely UP to (2, 8) if they were at (2, 7) and tried to move away from my right side.\n*   Apples: (1, 7), (8, 4), (0, 2), (7, 4), (2, 4). (If my move to (6, 7) didn't hit an apple, score remains 2).\n\nSince the official prompt data for Turn 4 gives a definitive board state and my score/position, I MUST use that, regardless of how the RATIONALES contradicted it. **I will assume the Turn 4 data represents the true state resulting from my last move (DOWN) and E0's unknown simultaneous move.**\n\n**Using Turn 4 Start Data:**\n*   **Turn:** 3 / 150 (This looks like a typo, should be Turn 4)\n*   **Apples:** (8, 4), (0, 2), (7, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2). (Total 5 apples)\n*   **My Score (ID 1):** 1 apple. (This means my move DOWN did NOT eat an apple).\n*   **E0 Score:** 2 apples.\n*   **My Head:** (6, 7). **My Body:** [(6, 8)]. (This means my move DOWN removed (7, 8) via growth, or my previous body was shorter, confirming structure differs from Rationale analysis).\n*   **E0 Head:** (1, 7). **Body:** [(1, 6), (2, 6)]. (This means E0 moved to (1, 7), likely eating apple (1, 7) if it existed, or moving towards it).\n\n**Board State Analysis based on Turn 4 INPUT:**\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . T . . .

Given its position relative to the body (1, 6) below it, E0 likely moved UP from (0, 7) or LEFT from (2, 7). If it ate an apple at (1, 7), it would have grown. The E0 score is 2, implying they have already eaten two. No apple is visible at (1, 7) now.\n\n**Target Evaluation:**\nClosest apples: (3, 2) [Dist 4], (2, 4) [Dist 5], (7, 4) [Dist 6]. (8, 4) [Dist 7], (0, 2) [Dist 7].\n*   **(3, 2):** Distance: $|6-3| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n*   **(2, 4):** Distance: $|6-2| + |7-4| = 4 + 3 = 7$.\n*   **(7, 4):** Distance: $|6-7| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4$. **(7, 4) is the closest apple.**\n\n**Strategic Choice (Aiming for (7, 4) from (6, 7)):**\nThe path towards (7, 4) is R, R, D, D, D.\n1. **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Ideal immediate step. Safe, reduces distance by 1.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 6):** Moves away from (7, 4) but keeps options open.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 7):** Moves away from (7, 4).\n\nMoving **RIGHT to (7, 7)** is the most aggressive and promising move towards the closest target (7, 4).\n\n**Collision Check (with E0 at (1, 7)):**\nE0 is far away. No immediate risk of head-on or body collision.\n\n**Safety Check for Next Turn:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 7):\nMy new body will be (6, 7) trailing (6, 8).\nPossible moves next turn from (7, 7): UP (7, 8), DOWN (7, 6), LEFT (6, 7) [Hits my head/new body segment], RIGHT (8, 7).\nMoving RIGHT seems safe and directly addresses the closest goal.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move towards (7, 4). If E0 tries to cut off the right side, I will rely on superior maneuvering given my shorter body length (1 segment vs 2 segments).\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT.\n\nMy last move was DOWN, resulting in a safe move but perhaps not optimal apple collection based on the preceding state. Now I am at (6, 7) and must move towards (7, 4).\nRIGHT to (7, 7).\n\nRIGHT",
