My body is empty.\n*   **Apples:** Still at (7, 0), (9, 1), (6, 6), (5, 1), (9, 0). The closest apple remains (9, 1), 3 units below my head at (9, 4).\n*   **Enemies:** Snake #1 is at (8, 3) with body segments at (7, 3) and (7, 2). The board state shows this correctly.\n*   **Last Move:** My last move was DOWN, moving my head from (9, 5) to (9, 4). The board state matches this. The rationale correctly states the closest apple is (9, 1) and chooses DOWN. However, the rationale incorrectly states my *last* position was (9, 5), not (9, 3). My position *before* the last DOWN move was (9, 5).\n*   **Possible Moves from (9, 4):**\n    *   UP: (9, 5) - This is where my head *was* last turn. It's not my body yet, so this move is technically allowed (I'm not moving backwards into my own tail segment, as my body is empty). Moving UP would take me back towards the apple (9, 1).\n    *   DOWN: (9, 3) - This moves me further down the column. The apple at (9, 1) is still below. The enemy snake is at (8, 3), so moving DOWN to (9, 3) doesn't risk a collision with the head. It's a valid move.\n    *   LEFT: (8, 4) - This moves me left along the row. It gets me further from the apple at (9, 1).\n    *   RIGHT: (10, 4) - This is outside the board boundaries. Death move.\n\n*   **Strategy:** The goal is to reach the closest apple (9, 1) safely. The path DOWN from (9, 4) towards (9, 1) is clear and safe. The path UP from (9, 4) back towards (9,",
