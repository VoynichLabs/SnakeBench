My head moved from (9, 5) to (9, 4).\n*   **Possible Moves from (9, 4):**\n    *   UP: (9, 5) - This is where my head was last turn. I cannot move back into my own body segment.\n    *   DOWN: (9, 3) - This moves me further down the column. The apple at (9, 1) is still below.\n    *   LEFT: (8, 4) - This moves me left along the row. It gets me further from the apple at (9, 1).\n    *   RIGHT: (10, 4) - This is outside the board boundaries (x must be 0-9). This is a death move.\n\n*   **Strategy:** My primary goal is to reach the closest apple, (9, 1), safely.
