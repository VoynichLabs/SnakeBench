Gaining apple #3 now and positioning at edge allows recovery (e.g., UP then RIGHT back central), keeping options open without trapping; UP or RIGHT maintains central position but delays eating the nearby apple while heading north (which may require zigzagging around apples). Enemy likely won't collide; if they LEFT to eat (7,4), it helps by removing competition there.

Avoid left edge long-term; watch enemy for potential westward moves. Keep scanning for chained apples, prioritize growing while avoiding bottlenecks (e.g., don't corner without escape plan).

Safe moves: UP invalid (backwards into own body at (5,9)); LEFT to (4,8) empty; RIGHT to (6,8) empty with apple; DOWN to (5,7) empty. No immediate kills, but evaluate collision risks.\n\nEnemy head at (7,7). Potential moves: UP invalid (into own body at (7,8)); LEFT to (6,7) empty; RIGHT to (8,7) empty; DOWN to (7,6) empty. They might head RIGHT toward the nearby apple at (9,7) (two RIGHTs: to (8,7) then (9,7)), or LEFT/DOWN for other reasons. Last turn they went DOWN from (7,8) to (7,7), skipping the adjacent apple at (6,8), suggesting they avoided it\u2014perhaps due to my previous close proximity, neck positioning, or southward intent. No clear sign they're coming for (6,8) soon.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (6,8): Eats the apple, gains 1 point (now 6 apples to their 3), grows snake by 1. After growth, new head at (6,8), body extends but tail stays; next turn options: UP to (6,9) empty; DOWN to (6,7) empty (ENEMY's likely position if they LEFT this turn); LEFT invalid (own body at (5,8)); RIGHT invalid (enemy body at (7,8)). If enemy LEFT to (6,7) this turn (possible but not guaranteed based on history), next turn they could UP to (6,8) for a potential head-on\u2014if I stay there, mutual death. But I can evade next turn by moving UP or DOWN. Since they skipped (6,8) last turn despite adjacency, it's unlikely they LEFT this turn to chase it now. Eating it blocks them from a quick grab and advances my score. Keeps 2 options open post-eat, no permatrapped spaces immediately.\n\nGoing DOWN to (5,7): Safe, no apple, moves toward southern apples ((9,0), (9,3)) and somewhat (6,6). From there, 2-3 options: LEFT to (4,7) empty; DOWN to (5,6) empty; RIGHT to (6,7) empty; UP back invalid own body. Avoids apple distraction, competes minimally with enemy (if they go south, paths diverge\u2014e.g., they to (7,6) then west/east). But skips a sure apple gain, prolongs the hunt.\n\nGoing LEFT to (4,8): Safe, no apple, positions closer to open west areas or loop south. But next turn severely restricts: Only DOWN to (4,7) safe (UP/RIGHT/LEFT invalid into body), risking trap if enemy or own tail cuts off later\u2014bad for flexibility.\n\nPrioritize RIGHT for apple gain and score lead; it's safer than it appears since enemy hasn't aggressively chased (6,8) and would need to commit moves upfront. If collision worry persists, DOWN is solid backup for evasion and south claim.\n\n### Plan for next few turns:\nEated (6,8), now at (6,8) with 6 apples. From here, avoid staying put next turn\u2014monitor enemy: if they went LEFT to (6,7), evade north to (6,9) or south to (6,7) next turn. If they swung west or south, circle toward (6,6) or bottom apples via (5,7) paths. Prioritize south to claim (9,0)/(9,3) edges if north contests; watch for head-ons in tight spaces, loop wide if enemy pursues. Avoid north expansion into their area.\n\nRIGHT",

Going DOWN to (2,6) is now safe because the enemy cannot move to (2,6) from their position\u2014enemy's DOWN from (2,6) is to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), UP to (2,7), and RIGHT into their own body (3,6) is invalid. Simultaneous moves mean no collision unless both heads land on the same cell; if enemy goes UP to (2,7), I go to (2,6), no overlap. This allows me to continue the southward path: after this move, I'll be at (2,6), ready to go DOWN again next turn toward (2,5), etc., clearing the way to (2,1) in about 5 more DOWN moves (to (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)).\n\nAlternatives:\n- LEFT to (1,7): Opens column 1, but moves away from the apple at (2,1) in column 2. I'd have to zig around back to column 2 later, wasting turns. Leaves more room but delays apple access.\n- UP to (2,8): Moves north into row 8, but my body tail is at (5,8) and (6,8) nearby, potentially trapping me. Enemy could follow south, but then I'd likely circle back down column 2 anyway, less efficiently than starting DOWN now. No apple nearby.\n\nDOWN keeps the plan alive, moves closer to (2,1), and maintains escape options (LEFT into column 1 if enemy follows aggressively). After eating (2,1), plan to shift towards (3,0) or detour to column 9 apples if the enemy pursues column 2.\n\nDOWN\n**END RATIONALE** \n\nADVANCE PLAN: Continue DOWN in column 2 through turns 24-29 to reach and eat (2,1) at y=1, assuming enemy doesn't block column 2. Then, from there, assess: if enemy is distant, move RIGHT to column 3 for (3,0); if enemy follows, zigzag LEFT to column 1 or RIGHT to column 3 early to evade, possibly aiming for column 9 apples later.\n\nDOWN",
