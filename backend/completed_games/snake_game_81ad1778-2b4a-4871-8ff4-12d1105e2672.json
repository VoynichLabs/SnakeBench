All moves are safe from immediate death.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate remaining moves strategically**\n\nLet me consider what the enemy might do and which moves position me best:\n\n- **UP to (1, 9)**: Moves me to top edge. Limited escape routes later. Only 3 adjacent cells.\n- **DOWN to (1, 7)**: Moves me closer to apples at (0, 1) and (0, 2) on the left side. More central position.\n- **LEFT to (0, 8)**: Moves me to left edge. Also limits future options.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 8)**: Moves me away from enemy head at (4, 8), keeping more distance. Opens more future options.\n\n**Analysis of apple locations:**\n- (0, 1) and (0, 2): On the far left, lower area - reachable via DOWN then LEFT\n- (5, 7) and (7, 5): Mid to right area\n- (9, 8): Far right at top\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The enemy is at (4, 8). Moving RIGHT to (2, 8) increases distance from enemy.\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 7) positions me toward the left-side apples at (0, 1) and (0, 2).\n- Both DOWN and RIGHT keep me reasonably central without getting trapped.\n\n**Best move selection:**\nDOWN seems better than RIGHT because:\n1. It moves me toward the cluster of apples at (0, 1) and (0, 2)\n2. I can establish a pattern of collecting these easier apples first\n3. It maintains good distance from the enemy\n4. It keeps multiple future directions open (I could go LEFT, UP, or DOWN from (1, 7))\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nFocus on collecting the apples at (0, 2) and (0, 1) on the left side as they're relatively close. This builds my score early. Then reassess the board and potentially move toward the other apples depending on enemy movement patterns.\n\nDOWN",

Also moves me closer to the enemy at (6, 7), which is risky at this stage.\n\n**Strategic Reasoning:**\n\nMy previous move established a strategy to collect the left-edge apple cluster at (0, 1) and (0, 2). Continuing DOWN is the logical next step because:\n1. These apples are close and relatively isolated from the enemy\n2. Moving DOWN gets me closer to (0, 2) - just 4 cells away\n3. I can collect both (0, 2) and (0, 1) in sequence to build my snake length early\n4. The left edge provides safety from the enemy snake which is concentrated on the right side\n5. Growing to length 3+ will help me compete better later\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nContinue DOWN to collect (0, 2) next turn, then (0, 1) on the following turn. After collecting these two apples and growing my snake to length 3, I'll have more flexibility to pursue other apples or maintain positional advantage while staying safe on the left side of the board.\n\nDOWN",

YES - no collision\n   - Position: moves me to (4, 9)\n   - This also allows pivoting downward toward (3, 4)\n   - Keeps options open\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI'm at the top edge at (3, 9). I cannot move UP (off board) or DOWN (into my body). I need to move either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nThe closest apple is at (3, 4), which is directly below my current column but I can't reach it directly. Both LEFT and RIGHT are safe moves. \n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 9) keeps me closer to potentially valuable apples while maintaining flexibility. Moving LEFT moves me toward the edge with fewer options.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (4, 9), I can pivot DOWN next turn to approach (3, 4). This seems like the optimal path.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 22: Move RIGHT to (4, 9)\n- Turn 23: Move DOWN toward the apple at (3, 4)\n- Continue working DOWN to collect the (3, 4) apple for 7 points\n- Monitor enemy snake's position and avoid the cluster around (7, 4-8)\n\nRIGHT",

Moving LEFT toward the center of the board gives me better access to multiple apples and avoids getting trapped on the right edge. \n\nThe enemy is at (6, 0) - relatively far from me. Moving LEFT and slightly down toward (6, 2) is a strong strategic move that keeps me ahead while positioning me to grab the next apple quickly.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (7, 5), I should continue moving down and left to reach (6, 2). The apples at (6, 2) and (7, 0) are in the right quadrant to pursue. I need to maintain my lead and grab apples faster than the enemy. Avoid the left side where enemy could trap me. Keep pushing toward the center-right area where multiple apples are clustered.\n\nLEFT",

This move:\n- Keeps me alive\n- Moves me closer to the (2, 0) apple\n- Allows me to pursue the bottom-left apple cluster to catch up on score\n- Increases distance from the enemy snake\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turns:**\nContinue LEFT toward (2, 0), then down to (0, 0). These apples are reachable and will help me tie or exceed the enemy's score of 10. After securing these bottom apples, pivot toward (3, 6) or (0, 6) depending on enemy position.\n\nLEFT",

UP to (7,4) keeps me in open terrain, avoids any enemy segments, and still leaves me the option to pivot back toward the center apples (especially the cluster near (3,6)) after I see how Snake #1 commits on his next turn.\n\nPlan: stay elevated around y=4-5 for a turn or two, watch Snake #1\u2019s new head position, and then circle back toward the middle/left apples once he either commits away or opens a corridor.\n\nUP",
