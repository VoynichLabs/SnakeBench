The target cell is not occupied by any snake\u2019s head or body, and no enemy can reach it in one step, so the move is safe. Eating the apple increases our score and length, bringing us closer to the 5\u2011apple win condition while preserving flexibility for future moves (we can then go up, left, or right without immediately trapping ourselves).\n\n**Plan**  \nEat the (1,7) apple now. After consuming it we will have head at (1,7) and body [(1,6), (1,5)], leaving us with options to move up, left, or right while avoiding a backward move into our own tail. Keep an eye on enemy #0\u2019s possible upward movement, but it cannot threaten us this turn.\n\nUP",

From there we can still go LEFT to (5,0) or UP to (6,1), giving two viable continuations. After moving UP we would be stuck at (7,1) with only ONE safe direction (LEFT) next turn, quickly limiting escape routes.  \n2. **Apple proximity** \u2013 The nearest apples are high up (y\u202f\u2265\u202f6). Moving UP does accelerate vertical progress, but the lack of a second safe exit makes the snake vulnerable to being boxed in by its own growing tail or by enemy maneuvers. Moving LEFT keeps a \u201creserve\u201d column (x\u202f=\u202f5) that can be used to maneuver around obstacles or to approach apples from a less\u2011crowded side.  \n3. **Collision risk with enemy** \u2013 The enemy head is at (0,2). Neither (6,0) nor (7,1) can be reached by the enemy in a single turn, so both are safe, but the LEFT move stays farther from the enemy\u2019s current path, reducing the chance of an accidental head\u2011on clash if the enemy decides to move rightward.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n- Move LEFT to (6,0).  \n- Next turn aim to go UP while keeping the option to retreat LEFT if needed, preserving a corridor toward the upper\u2011right apples.  \n- Continue to hug the left\u2011hand side of the board until we can turn upward into the column where apples (1,6), (2,9), (4,7), (6,7), (6,9) are reachable without entering a dead\u2011end.\n\nLEFT",

The cell (6,\u202f0) will become part of the body, but the next turn we will still have three safe directions: UP to (6,\u202f2), LEFT to (5,\u202f1), and RIGHT to (7,\u202f1). All of these cells are currently unoccupied, preserving flexibility.\n- After **LEFT**, the head would be at (5,\u202f0). The next turn we would only have two safe directions: LEFT to (4,\u202f0) and UP to (5,\u202f1); moving RIGHT would step into the body cell (6,\u202f0) and would be fatal. This reduces the number of viable continuations.\n\n**Apple proximity**\n\nThe most valuable apples lie at (6,\u202f7) and (6,\u202f9), directly above our current column. Moving **UP** brings us one step closer to those apples, while moving **LEFT** moves us away laterally and does not reduce the vertical distance to any apple.\n\n**Collision risk with the enemy**\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is positioned far to the left (head at (0,\u202f3)). Neither (6,\u202f1) nor (5,\u202f0) is reachable by the enemy in a single turn, so both are safe, but staying in the same column as the target apples keeps us aligned with the highest\u2011value fruit and avoids unnecessary sideways detours.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBoth safe moves keep us alive, but **UP** offers more future safe directions, moves us closer to the highest\u2011value apples, and maintains a broader maneuvering space. Therefore the optimal choice is to move **UP**.\n\nPlan: Move UP to head toward the (6,7) and (6,9) apples while keeping LEFT and RIGHT options open for later maneuvering.\nUP",

Eat the apple at (6,7) by moving UP.  \n2. Continue upward toward (6,8) and then (6,9) to claim the valuable apple there.  \n3.

Since all other directions are unsafe, the only viable option is to go RIGHT.  \n\nRIGHT",

The cells (7,3) and (7,4) appear empty and not occupied by any snake body, so this is a safe progression.\n- DOWN would move away from the nearest apple and into open space without progress toward an apple.\n- RIGHT would push you toward the dense enemy cluster on the right and make turning back onto your own body more dangerous later.\n\nPlan:\n- Move UP to chase the apple at (7,5). Then eat it when reached, growing longer, and continue toward the next closest apple while monitoring enemy positions to avoid traps or head-on collisions. Maintain space to retreat if needed and avoid getting squeezed between walls or enemy bodies.\n\nUP",
