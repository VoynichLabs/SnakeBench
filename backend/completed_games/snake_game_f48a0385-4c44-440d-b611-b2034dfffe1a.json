Apples: 0.\nApples: (8, 2), (8, 8), (3, 7), (4, 4), (1, 5).\n\nMy mobility depends on avoiding:\n1. Going out of bounds: $x, y \\in [0, 9]$.\n2. Moving into my body (currently none, except moving backwards into the cell I occupied before the move, which is not relevant yet as I have no body segments). Since I have no body, the reverse move is safe regarding self-collision, but I must consider the \"moving directly backwards into your own body\" rule if I *had* a body. With no body, only boundary checks apply for self-preservation related to size.\n3. Moving into the enemy snake's head or body. My head (1, 6). Enemy head (3, 5).\n\nLet's analyze potential moves for my head (1, 6): (x, y)\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP (1, 7):**\n    *   Bounds check: Safe (1, 7) is inside [0, 9] x [0, 9].\n    *   Self-collision: Safe (no body).\n    *   Enemy collision: Enemy head is at (3, 5). (1, 7) is safe from (3, 5).\n\n2.  **DOWN (1, 5):**\n    *   Bounds check: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision: Safe from (3, 5).\n    *   **Apple Check:** There is an apple at (1, 5). If I move DOWN, I eat this apple. My new length will be 1 (head) + 1 (original body, which is 0 segments, so now 2 total cells occupied, the new head and the old head position (1,6) acting as the tail). **Wait, the rule is \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point\".** Since my current body is empty, moving to where the apple is means my new head is (1, 5), and my previous head position (1, 6) becomes my tail segment. This move eats the apple at (1, 5).\n\n3.  **LEFT (0, 6):**\n    *   Bounds check: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision: Safe from (3, 5).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 6):**\n    *   Bounds check: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision: Safe from (3, 5).\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 5)):**\nSnake #0 must also choose a move. Since my goal is to maximize my position and safely eat apples, I need to consider where the enemy *might* move to avoid dangerous overlaps.\n\nIf I move to (1, 5) (DOWN/Eat Apple):\nMy new position: Head (1, 5), Body: (1, 6).\nEnemy at (3, 5). Possible enemy moves:\n*   UP (3, 6): Safe for enemy.\n*   DOWN (3, 4): Safe for enemy.\n*   LEFT (2, 5): Safe for enemy.\n*   RIGHT (4, 5): Safe for enemy.\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 5), this is near the apple at (4, 4).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (3, 6), this is near the apple at (3, 7).\n\n**Prioritizing Apples:**\nThe closest and most directly accessible apple is at (1, 5), which is achievable by moving DOWN. Eating this apple immediately improves my score and size, which is generally a high priority, especially since self-collision is not an immediate threat due to my current lack of body.\n\nTarget Apple List: (1, 5) is the closest.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 5):\nI successfully acquire the apple. My snake becomes: Head (1, 5), Body: (1, 6). Score +1.\nEnemy remains at (3, 5).\n\nIf I move to (1, 7), (0, 6), or (2, 6), I approach other areas or maintain position relative to the enemy, but I miss an immediate apple.\n\nLet's check collision possibility in the next turn T+1 if I move DOWN.\nT+1: My snake is H(1, 5), B(1, 6). Enemy H(3, 5).\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (2, 5), this position is adjacent to my tail segment (1, 6) but not intersecting.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (3, 6), this is safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN, I secure an apple and maintain a safe position relative to the enemy. The enemy's head (3, 5) is not currently threatening my path or position based on predictable movement away from me, nor am I directly blocking the enemy's necessary moves toward any apple.\n\nSince the DOWN move leads to an immediate gain (apple) and I face no immediate danger, this is the preferred choice.\n\n**Short-term strategy:** Secure the nearest available apple to build size and score advantage while remaining safe.\n\nMove: DOWN (to (1, 5), eating the apple).\n\n**Long-term plan note:** Focus on clearing the apples in the bottom-left quadrant first, as they seem slightly more accessible before positioning towards the dense cluster/corners (8,8) and (8,2).\n\nI confirm that moving DOWN to (1, 5) does not cause any immediate self-collision (as my body is empty) and does not coincide with the enemy head (3, 5).\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n    *   Apple check: No apple at (2, 5).\n\n**Predicting Enemy Move (H(3, 5)):**\nEnemy possibilities: UP (3, 6), DOWN (3, 4), LEFT (2, 5), RIGHT (4, 5).\n\n*   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 5): This approaches the apple at (4, 4).\n*   If Enemy moves UP to (3, 6): This approaches the apple at (3, 7).\n\n**Apple Proximity Analysis:**\n1. (4, 4): 2 moves away (e.g., RIGHT, DOWN). Closest large cluster of food seems to be around X=8.\n2. (3, 7): 2 moves away (e.g., UP, UP).\n\nThe nearest safe path for me is towards (2, 5) or (3, 4)/ (1, 4) if I move towards the center.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (2, 5)**:\nMy new position: H(2, 5), B(1, 5), T(1, 6).\nThis positions me horizontally close to the enemy (H(3, 5)).\n\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 5): No overlap or immediate danger.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (3, 6): We are parallel.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (1, 4)**:\nMy new position: H(1, 4), B(1, 5), T(1, 6). Still low on the map.\n\nComparing RIGHT (2, 5) and DOWN (1, 4):\nMoving RIGHT puts me on the same Y-level as the enemy (Y=5), potentially setting up future offensive/defensive positioning or collisions if the enemy tries to follow me horizontally. It also moves me slightly inward towards the center mass of apples (4, 4).\n\nMoving DOWN keeps me further away on the Y-axis but maintains a wall-like shape along X=1.\n\nSince I have slightly more space on the bottom (Y=0) and I want to move towards the mass of food around X=3 to X=4, moving **RIGHT to (2, 5)** seems strategically better for closing the gap to the (4, 4) apple by reducing the horizontal distance to 1 unit from the enemy, while also giving me better options for approaching (4, 4) or (3, 7) next turn.\n\nLet's assume enemy plays optimally towards food. If Enemy goes to (4, 5) (RIGHT), I am at (2, 5). Next turn I can go to (3, 4), (3, 5), or (2, 4). If Enemy prioritizes (3, 7), they go UP to (3, 6). I can then move RIGHT to (3, 5), which is a direct approach to the enemy head, but also covers the space the enemy just left.\n\nIf I move RIGHT (2, 5):\nEnemy could move UP (3, 6). My goal apple (4, 4) is 3 steps away.\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT (4, 5). My goal apple (4, 4) is 2 steps away (e.g., move to (3, 4) then (4, 4) next).\n\nRIGHT seems to offer superior positioning towards the nearest accessible food (4, 4) compared to DOWN (1, 4).\n\nLong-term strategy: Continue securing central/lower apples (4, 4) before moving towards the high-value/high-risk corner apples (X=8). Maintain a safe distance/orientation relative to Snake #0.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRight now, your snake is at H(1, 5), B(1, 6). Enemy is at H(3, 5).\nThe move chosen was RIGHT, moving H to (2, 5).\n\nUP (1, 6) -> Self-collision (body segment at (1, 6)). DEAD.\nDOWN (1, 4) -> Safe.\nLEFT (0, 5) -> Safe.\nRIGHT (2, 5) -> Chosen. Safe.\n\nMy move: RIGHT.\nEnemy moves simultaneously.\n\nIf Enemy moves UP (3, 6): New state: My H(2, 5), B(1, 5), T(1, 6) vs E H(3, 6). Safe.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN (3, 4): New state: My H(2, 5) vs E H(3, 4). Safe.\nIf Enemy moves LEFT (2, 5): **HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die!** (If Enemy chooses LEFT, this is a bad outcome for me choosing RIGHT unless survival is guaranteed elsewhere).\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT (4, 5): New state: My H(2, 5) vs E H(4, 5). Safe.\n\nSince the enemy *could* move LEFT to (2, 5) and kill us both, I must re-evaluate. The move RIGHT is risky because it collides with the enemy's potential counter-move (LEFT).\n\nRevisiting safe moves: DOWN (1, 4) and LEFT (0, 5).\n\nIf I move **LEFT (0, 5)**: H(0, 5), B(1, 5), T(1, 6).\nEnemy H(3, 5) potential moves:\n*   LEFT (2, 5): Safe from me.\n*   RIGHT (4, 5): Safe from me.\n*   UP (3, 6): Safe from me.\n*   DOWN (3, 4): Safe from me.\nThis move guarantees survival this turn regardless of enemy choice, as long as the enemy doesn't move into my body (which is only (1, 6) or (1, 5)). None of the enemy moves place them on (1, 5) or (1, 6).\n\nIf I move **DOWN (1, 4)**: H(1, 4), B(1, 5), T(1, 6).\nEnemy H(3, 5) potential moves:\n*   LEFT (2, 5): Safe from me.\n*   RIGHT (4, 5): Safe from me.\n*   UP (3, 6): Safe from me.\n*   DOWN (3, 4): Safe from me.\nThis move also guarantees survival this turn.\n\n**Comparing LEFT (0, 5) vs DOWN (1, 4):**\nLEFT puts me against the border, limiting movement options in future turns (only 3 safe directions next turn).\nDOWN keeps me slightly more centralized relative to the board, maintaining 4 safe directions for the next turn (1, 5 is blocked, but 0, 4; 2, 4; 1, 3 are open).\n\nThe apple at (4, 4) is 3 steps away if I go DOWN (1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 in X, but Y changes too).\nFrom (1, 4):\nT+1: (2, 4) or (1, 3)\nT+2: (2, 3) or (3, 4) or (2, 5) or (1, 2)\n\nFrom (0, 5):\nT+1: (0, 4) or (1, 5) [Blocked by my body segment] or (0, 6). (1, 5) is where my head currently is! Wait, (1, 5) is now my body segment if I move LEFT to (0, 5). So UP (0, 6), DOWN (0, 4).\n\nLet's re-check body collision for LEFT (0, 5): H(0, 5). B(1, 5), T(1, 6).\nMove H to (0, 5).\nNext move options:\nUP (0, 6) - Safe\nDOWN (0, 4) - Safe\nRIGHT (1, 5) - **Collision with my own body segment (1, 5)! Eliminated for T+1.**\n\nSo, moving LEFT severely restricts my options immediately.\n\nMoving DOWN (1, 4): H(1, 4), B(1, 5), T(1, 6). Body occupies (1, 5), (1, 6).\nNext move options:\nUP (1, 5) - **Collision with my own body segment (1, 5)! Eliminated for T+1.**\nDOWN (1, 3) - Safe\nLEFT (0, 4) - Safe\nRIGHT (2, 4) - Safe\n\nBoth moves restrict future movement by immediately bumping into the segment just grown (1, 5). (2 safe moves out of 4).\n\nSince DOWN maintains a slightly better central position relative to the food mass (4, 4) and (3, 7) than being stuck on the left wall, I choose DOWN.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move downwards defensively to avoid any potential head-on collision this turn, then aim to maneuver towards the central apple (4, 4) on subsequent turns, staying safe from Snake #0 currently positioned at (3, 5).\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nIn the previous turn, I moved DOWN to (1, 4).\nMy snake is now: Head (1, 4), Body: (1, 5), Tail (1, 6). Length 3. Score 1.\nEnemy Snake #0 is at Head (3, 5). Length 1. Score 0.\n\n**Analyzing current move possibilities from H(1, 4):**\nMy constraints: I cannot move UP to (1, 5) as it is my body segment.\nPossible moves: DOWN (1, 3), LEFT (0, 4), RIGHT (2, 4).\n\n**Predicting Enemy Move (H(3, 5)):**\nEnemy possibilities: UP (3, 6), DOWN (3, 4), LEFT (2, 5), RIGHT (4, 5).\n\n1.  **DOWN (1, 3):** Safe. Approaches Y=0.\n2.  **LEFT (0, 4):** Safe, approaches wall.\n3.  **RIGHT (2, 4):** Safe, moves towards center and apple (4, 4).\n\n**Enemy Collision Check for current candidates:**\nIf I move to (1, 3), (0, 4), or (2, 4), the enemy head at (3, 5) cannot reach any of these spots in one move, nor can it reach my body segments (1, 5), (1, 6). Head-on collision is also impossible as my desired next locations are 2 or 3 units away from (3, 5).\n\n**Targeting Apple (4, 4):**\nMove RIGHT to (2, 4) is the best move towards (4, 4) (distance reduced by 1 unit in X).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 4): My snake is H(2, 4), B(1, 4), B(1, 5), T(1, 6).\nEnemy might move RIGHT to (4, 5) to get near (4, 4).\n\nIf Enemy moves R to (4, 5): My H(2, 4) vs E H(4, 5).

Moves towards the central area.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 3):** Safe. Moves away from the enemy and towards the bottom edge.\n3.  **RIGHT (3, 4):** Best move towards apple (4, 4). Distance to apple reduced to 1 unit.\n\n**External Collision Check:**\nH(2, 4). Enemy H(4, 5).\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 4): The enemy must move to (3, 4) to collide. Enemy possibilities: (4, 6), (4, 4), (3, 5), (5, 5). (3, 4) is safe from all enemy moves.\n\n**Apple (4, 4) Check:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 4), I am now adjacent to (4, 4).\n\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (4, 4): **MAJOR CONFLICT!** Enemy eats the closest apple AND I move adjacent to it. If the enemy takes (4, 4), my advantage slows down.\n\nLet's see if I can beat the enemy to (4, 4) in T+1.\nIf I move RIGHT (3, 4).\nIf Enemy moves DOWN (4, 4). Enemy eats apple.\nIf Enemy moves UP (4, 6). I can move RIGHT (4, 4) next turn and eat it.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 5):\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (4, 4). Safe.\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (3, 5). Safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 3):\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (4, 4). Safe.\n\nThe best line of approach to secure (4, 4) seems to be moving RIGHT to (3, 4). This forces the enemy to either contend for the apple or move elsewhere.\n\nScenario A: I move RIGHT (3, 4).\nA1: Enemy moves DOWN (4, 4) -> Enemy eats apple. I am at (3, 4). Safe collision-wise.\nA2: Enemy moves UP (4, 6) -> I move RIGHT (4, 4) next turn and eat it.\n\nScenario B: I move UP (2, 5).\nB1: Enemy moves DOWN (4, 4) -> Enemy eats apple. I am at (2, 5). Safe.\nB2: Enemy moves LEFT (3, 5). I move RIGHT (3, 4). Now I am closer to the apple than the enemy (who is at (3, 5)).\n\nIt appears that RIGHT (3, 4) is the fastest path to the apple (4, 4), even if the enemy is also trying to get it. Given the simultaneous move, if the enemy chooses (4, 4), they win that exchange this turn, but I position myself optimally for the *next* turn if they don't grab it, or I maintain parity if they do grab it, because my path is direct toward it.\n\nIf the enemy targets (4, 4) by moving DOWN to (4, 4), they sacrifice immediate positioning/advantage against me, but they gain a point. If I move RIGHT to (3, 4), I am one step away.\n\nIf I move UP (2, 5), I am 2 steps away from (4, 4) and the enemy can safely secure it by moving DOWN (4, 4).\n\nTherefore, the direct aggressive approach towards the nearest food source is the best strategy here, despite the slight risk of the enemy converging on it simultaneously.\n\nMove RIGHT (3, 4).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Focus solely on capturing the (4, 4) apple immediately. If the enemy gets it, shift focus to the next closest uncollected apple, likely (3, 7).

This implies my move to (3, 4) *was* a move *onto* (4, 4).\n**Correction based on outcome:** My move was to (3, 4). If I ate (4, 4), my intended move must have been RIGHT again, landing on (4, 4) if the board state implies I ate it. Let's re-examine T3 moves:\nMy Head @ (2, 4). Target (4, 4). Previous rationale suggested RIGHT to (3, 4) as a step *towards* (4, 4).\nIf I executed RIGHT to (3, 4), and the board shows E(4, 5) vs H(3, 4), and my score increased by 1, it means I must have eaten (4, 4) in T3. For me to eat (4, 4) from (2, 4), I must have moved RIGHT twice, or the target apple was actually (3, 4).\nApples at T3 start: (8, 2), (8, 8), (3, 7), (4, 4), (8, 7). My H=(2, 4).\nIf I moved RIGHT to (3, 4), that is NOT an apple.\nIf the board state provided is accurate (Score +1, H=(3, 4)), it implies that the enemy MUST have moved to (4, 4) and prevented me from getting it, OR the game engine has registered an apple collection where I didn't move directly onto it, OR the apple was actually at (3, 4) which it wasn't based on the list.\n\n**Assuming the Board State provided for T4 is the ground truth for my previous move outcome:**\nMy H=(3, 4). Score=2. Apple (4, 4) is gone.\nEnemy H=(3, 5).\n\nSince the apple at (4, 4) is gone, and I gained a point, I must have eaten it, which means my previous move landed on (4, 4). If H=(2, 4), moving RIGHT lands on (3, 4). This is a contradiction unless the move recorded was the second step to (4, 4) in one turn, or the system logic for recording the move chosen vs the final state differs.\nGiven the strict constraints, I MUST assume **I moved to (3, 4)**, and that **the apple at (4, 4) was consumed by ME**. For this to happen by moving only one square right, the apple must have been at (3, 4), which it wasn't.\n\n*Self-Correction based on standard engine behavior*: If the chosen move in the RATIONALE was RIGHT (to (3, 4)), and the resulting board shows H(3, 4) AND Score +1, AND the previous apple list included (4, 4), this is confusing. I will proceed assuming that the desired outcome (getting closer to (4, 4)) was achieved, and that I *did* score, thus one of my moves (T2 or T3) landed on an apple. Since T2 was DOWN (1, 5) -> Score +1, and T3 was RIGHT (3, 4) -> Score +1 => Total Score 2.\nWait, the score at T1 start was 1.\nIf T2 move (DOWN to 1, 4) resulted in score 1 -> 1 (no apple eaten).\nIf T3 move (RIGHT to 3, 4) resulted in score 1 -> 2 (apple eaten).\nIf I ate an apple in T3, it must be that (3, 4) was an apple OR the move onto (3, 4) caused growth, despite (3, 4) not being listed as an apple in T3 start.\n\nLet's check T3 Apple list: (8, 2), (8, 8), (3, 7), (4, 4), (8, 7). (3, 4) is NOT an apple.\nThis implies the board state summary is highly suspect regarding how the previous move was executed vs. how the state is presented.\n\n**Crucial Assumption:** I am currently at H(3, 4), B(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5). Score 2. Length 4. Enemy at H(3, 5). I must treat the current state as gospel. The enemy did NOT move to (4, 4) because it is still listed in the T4 apple list summary (though it seems the list is confusingly presented in the T4 state block vs T3 start).\n\n**Re-examining T4 Apple List:** (8, 2), (8, 8), (3, 7), (8, 7). **(4, 4) is missing!** This confirms I ate (4, 4) in the move leading to T4 state. My move to (3, 4) must have been the move that *directly* resulted in eating (4, 4). Given H=(2, 4), a single RIGHT move lands on (3, 4). This means the mechanic must be misunderstood OR the board state visualization for T3 start/T4 end is inconsistent regarding apple consumption vs head position.\n\n*Resolution*: I accept H=(3, 4), Score=2, and (4, 4) is consumed. Enemy H=(3, 5).\n\n**Analyzing current move possibilities from H(3, 4):**\nMy constraints: Cannot move LEFT to (2, 4) (Body).\nPossible moves: UP (3, 5), DOWN (3, 3), RIGHT (4, 4).\n\n**Enemy H(3, 5) Position is CRITICAL.**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 5):** **IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON COLLISION with Enemy Head (3, 5)!** Both snakes die! **Eliminated.**\n2.  **DOWN (3, 3):** Safe from head collision. Moves away from the enemy.\n3.  **RIGHT (4, 4):** Safe from head collision. (4, 4) is empty.\n\n**Comparing DOWN (3, 3) vs RIGHT (4, 4):**\nEnemy H(3, 5) is directly adjacent to me.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT (4, 4)**: New H(4, 4). Enemy H(3, 5). Safe separation.\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (2, 5), they move away from me.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (3, 6), they move away from me.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (3, 4), **they move into my tail segment at (3, 4) if they collide with (3, 4) instead... wait, my head is at (3, 4), so they CANNOT move to (3, 4) as I leave it.**\n\nIf I move RIGHT (4, 4), the enemy must move to (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), or (3, 4 -- which is impossible as that's my vacated spot). Any legal move by the enemy relative to (3, 5) is safe from my new position (4, 4).\n\nIf I move **DOWN (3, 3)**: New H(3, 3). Enemy H(3, 5). Safe. Enemy can move to (3, 4) (my vacated spot) which is safe for them, or move elsewhere.\n\nThe next primary target apple is (3, 7) or the cluster at X=8.\n(3, 7) is 4 segments away from (3, 3) vs 3 segments away from (4, 4).\n(4, 4) is a better position to pivot towards (3, 7) or continue spreading out.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 4) places me closer to the center/right side of the board, offering better mobility options for the next few turns compared to sinking towards Y=0 boundary via (3, 3). Given the immediate threat of collision if I move UP, RIGHT seems best to advance toward food sources (though (3, 7) requires moving slightly left later).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Secure the best possible position after narrowly avoiding a fatal head-on move. Move RIGHT to (4, 4) to maintain central presence and continue approaching the upper food sources ((3, 7) or X=8 cluster). Maintain distance from Snake #0 head (3, 5).\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\nTurn: 5 / 150\n\nApples at: (8, 2), (8, 8), (3, 7), (8, 7)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 2\n  - Snake #0 apples: 0\n\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (4, 4)\n  - Body: [(3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4)]\n  - Apples collected: 2\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #0 - Head: (2, 5), Body: none, Apples: 0\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . .

Very close, but safe IF they don't move into my body (1, 4/1, 5). (3, 5) is safe for enemy.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (2, 6): Safe.

Since I have a size advantage (4 segments vs 1), I can afford slightly more aggressive moves towards food, maximizing distance from the base of my snake (X=1) to keep movement options open.

This also keeps me slightly further away from the enemy's current location (3, 5) than moving RIGHT might encourage them to follow.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Secure apple (3, 7) immediately. After that, decide whether to sweep the X=8 apples or consolidate size/wait for the enemy to move into a blocking structure.

Moves towards (8, 8).\n\n**Apple Proximity:** Nearest apples are at X=8 (Y=2, 7, 8). (4, 7) is 3 steps from (8, 7).\n\nIf I move **UP to (4, 7)**:\nEnemy H(3, 6) can move to (3, 7) [Apple!], (2, 6), (4, 6) [My vacated spot], or (3, 5).\n\nIf Enemy moves to (3, 7), Enemy gets an apple. This is highly likely as it's the closest for them too from (3, 6).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (5, 6)**:\nThis positions me better for X=8, but allows enemy to take (3, 7). (3, 7) seems more strategically important than rushing to the corner cluster, but avoiding enemy gain is also important.\n\nIf E takes (3, 7) -> E Score 1. E H(3, 7).\nMy H(4, 6) -> (5, 6). E H(3, 7). Safe. Now I can pivot to X=8 cluster.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 7):\nE moves RIGHT to (4, 6) [My vacated spot], or E moves UP to (3, 7) [Apple]. If E moves to (3, 7), E scores.\n\nSince both my immediate safe moves allow the enemy to score on (3, 7) via a very short path (1 step for E from 3, 6 -> 3, 7 or 4, 6 -> 4, 7), prioritizing the X=8 cluster seems better than losing the race for (3, 7) anyway.\n\nLet's choose **RIGHT (5, 6)** to start working towards the X=8 cluster. This forces E to choose between occupying my vacated spot (4, 6) or grabbing (3, 7).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Head towards the X=8 cluster of apples ((8, 2), (8, 7), (8, 8)).

(Previous rationale suggests I moved to (1, 5) eating A(1, 5) -> H(1, 5), B(1, 6) in T1, which is inconsistent with T2 start state H(1, 5), B(1, 6)).\n\n**Re-reconciling initial state vs T2 start:** Game log shows: T1: DOWN, Result H(1, 5), B(1, 6), Score 1.

If L=5, new L=6 if eat apple. If no eat, L=5, tail drops.\n\n**Crucial insight:** If I ate an apple in T7 (Score 2->3) and moved UP (4, 5)->(4, 6), my length increased. The tail segment that dropped must have been the one at the very end of the chain *before growth*.\nIf L=5 at start of T6 (H(4, 5), B(3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)).\nT6 UP: H(4, 6). L=6 (growth).

L=5. Score 3.\nThis implies that when moving RIGHT to (5, 5) from (4, 6), I did NOT eat an apple, AND the tail segment (1, 5) was dropped. L=5 -> L=4.\n\nIf L=5 at T6 start: H(4, 5), B(3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3) [assuming movement sequence before T6]. Let's stick to the provided Board State configuration for T8: L=5, B has 4 segments. Tail (1, 4) must have dropped in T7.\n\nEnemy H(3, 7).

(8, 7) and (8, 8) are the closest.\n\nFrom (5, 5):\nTo (8, 7) requires 3 steps right/up movement (e.g., (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7)).\n\nMove **RIGHT (6, 5)** is the best progression towards X=8.\nIf I move RIGHT (6, 5):\nEnemy H(3, 7) can move towards me or towards X=8.\nE possibilities: (3, 8), (2, 7), (4, 7), (3, 6).\nIf E moves UP to (3, 8), they stay near the corner but far from me.\nIf E moves RIGHT to (4, 7), they gain ground towards my target X=8.\n\nIf I move RIGHT (6, 5). Next turn I aim for (7, 6) or (6, 6).\n\nIf I move **UP (5, 6)**: This is 1 step closer to E(3, 7), but E is moving right towards my target region.\n\nMoving RIGHT (6, 5) allows me to cover more horizontal distance towards the bulk of remaining food in the corner, which is usually favorable when the opponent has a single, separated apple.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Secure the X=8 apples. Prefer RIGHT moves to close the gap to X=8 cluster (8, 7) or (8, 8).

Since the top half is cleared, sweep left along Y=8, then drop down towards (8, 2).\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
