The enemy snake is directly above me at (3, 7), so moving UP repeatedly would eventually lead to a collision\n2. There are several apples clustered in the top-right area (8,9), (9,9), (7,9)\n3.

There's one apple at (1,0) in the bottom-left, which is closer to me\n\n**Immediate Options:**\n- UP: Move toward (3, 3) - gets me closer to middle apples but also closer to enemy snake\n- DOWN: Move to (3, 1) - gets me closer to the (1, 0) apple\n- LEFT: Move to (2, 2) - neutral positioning\n- RIGHT: Move to (4, 2) - starts moving toward the right side where most apples are\n\n**Strategy Decision:**\nI think I should head RIGHT to start moving toward the cluster of apples on the right side of the board. The enemy snake is currently far enough away (at 3,7) that I don't need to worry about immediate collision. Moving right puts me on a path toward multiple apples at (7,5), (7,9), (8,9), and (9,9).\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:** Continue moving right to get closer to the apple cluster, then decide whether to go up toward the top apples or stay middle for the (7,5) apple.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake has moved to (7, 7), which means we're now both on the same x-coordinate (x=7). There's an apple at (7, 5) that's between us - it's 3 spaces above me and 2 spaces below the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Options:**\n1. **UP**: Move to (7, 3) - continues toward the (7, 5) apple, but creates potential for head-on collision\n2. **RIGHT**: Move to (8, 2) - safe move, positions toward other apples\n3. **LEFT**: Move to (6, 2) - safe move but less optimal positioning\n4. **DOWN**: Move to (7, 1) - safe but moves away from apples\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nIf I move UP and the enemy moves DOWN, we'll be getting closer to each other on the same column. However, the apple at (7, 5) is closer to me (3 moves) than to the enemy (2 moves). Wait - actually the enemy is closer! The enemy at (7, 7) can reach (7, 5) in 2 moves down, while I need 3 moves up.\n\n**Best Strategy:**\nI think I should move RIGHT to (8, 2). Here's why:\n- It avoids the potential collision course on x=7\n- It positions me well for the (8, 9) apple\n- It gives me flexibility to reassess next turn\n- The (7, 5) apple is actually closer to the enemy anyway\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:** After moving to (8, 2), I can either continue RIGHT toward (9, 9) apple, or move UP to start working toward the upper apple cluster.

It moves me toward the (9, 7) apple\n2. It keeps me away from the enemy snake who is in the top area but more toward the left\n3. After reaching (9, 7), I could potentially contest other apples or move toward (7, 5)\n\n**DOWN to (9, 1)** is less appealing because:\n1. It moves me away from most apples\n2. It puts me closer to the edge with fewer options\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue UP toward (9, 7) apple. The enemy snake seems focused on the left side of the top area, so the right column might be safer for me to travel.

Still leave me in good position to go for the (7, 5) apple next\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll be at (7, 2) and can then move UP toward (7, 5) for another easy collection.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After collecting the apple at (7, 2), move UP toward the apple at (7, 5). From (7, 2), it will take 3 moves UP to reach (7, 5). Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position to ensure they don't intercept my path.\n\nDOWN",

If the enemy snake moves UP next turn, it could potentially cut me off or create a dangerous situation.\n\nMoving UP would keep me safe from the enemy snake and potentially position me to move left in the next turn to approach the apple at (1, 6) or (2, 7).\n\nMoving DOWN would create distance between me and my body, allowing more flexibility in future moves, but would also position me closer to the enemy snake if it decides to move up.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think moving UP is the safest option for now.

My strategy is working exactly as planned. I'm now at (3, 4), directly below the apple at (3, 5).\n\n**Available Apples:**\n- (3, 5) - directly above me! Just 1 UP move away\n- (1, 6) - 2 LEFT, 2 UP - moderate distance  \n- (2, 7) - 1 LEFT, 3 UP - moderate distance\n- (0, 5) - 3 LEFT, 1 UP - distant\n- (1, 0) - 2 LEFT, 4 DOWN - distant\n\n**Movement Options from (3, 4):**\n1. **UP to (3, 5)**: EXCELLENT! This gets me the apple immediately - this is exactly what I planned\n2. **DOWN to (3, 3)**: Safe but moves away from apples\n3. **LEFT to (2, 4)**: Safe but unnecessary when I have an apple right above me\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 4)**: ILLEGAL - that's where my body segment is!\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nThis is perfect execution of my plan! The apple at (3, 5) is just one move away. The enemy snake at (4, 6) is close but not threatening this specific move - they're 1 space to the right and 2 spaces up from my target.\n\nAfter I collect this apple at (3, 5), I'll need to quickly assess the next target. The closest remaining apples will be:\n- (1, 6) - would be 2 LEFT, 1 UP from (3, 5)\n- (2, 7) - would be 1 LEFT, 2 UP from (3, 5)\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After collecting the apple at (3, 5), I should target either (1, 6) or (2, 7) next. I need to be mindful of the enemy snake's position and avoid getting trapped in the upper area where they're currently positioned.\n\nUP",

However, this is risky because the enemy snake at (3, 4) might move right to (4, 4), which would block my path.\n\nThe apple at (3, 5) is the closest, but it's risky to go down because of the enemy snake below. The apple at (1, 6) is straight left and there appears to be a clear path. The apple at (2, 7) is close too and can be approached from either UP or LEFT.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think moving LEFT is the safest and most strategic option. It allows me to continue toward the apple at (1, 6) while also keeping the apple at (2, 7) accessible. It also keeps me away from the enemy snake.\n\nFor my next turn, I'll need to decide whether to continue left toward (1, 6) or move up toward (2, 7), depending on the updated positions.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT: To (2, 8) - This is safe and opens up more space.\n\n## Decision Making\n\nI have two viable moves: UP or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 9), I'll be at the top edge of the board. While this is safe, it limits my future movements since I can only go LEFT (which would corner me) or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 8), I maintain more flexibility for future moves. I can continue moving RIGHT, go UP to (2, 9), or potentially go DOWN in future turns as my tail moves. This gives me more options and doesn't restrict my movement as much.\n\nLooking at the apple locations, the closest ones to me are at (3, 5) and (5, 4). Moving RIGHT puts me in a better position to eventually navigate toward these apples. The enemy snake is currently in the bottom left corner and doesn't pose an immediate threat to me.\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (2, 8), I'll likely continue moving RIGHT to position (3, 8) to gain more central positioning. From there, I can assess whether to continue moving toward the apple at (3, 5) by going DOWN, or to keep moving RIGHT to maintain flexibility and possibly approach the apple at (5, 4) later.\n\nRIGHT",

Great success with my strategy\n- My snake is now 9 segments long\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 7) with body at [(3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7)]\n\n**Available Movement Options from (2, 1):**\n1. **UP to (2, 2)**: Safe empty space\n2. **DOWN to (2, 0)**: ILLEGAL! That's where my body segment is (just came from there)\n3. **LEFT to (1, 1)**: Safe empty space\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 1)**: Safe empty space\n\n**Remaining Apples Analysis:**\n- (5, 4): Center-right area, good target\n- (9, 4): Far right edge\n- (3, 5): Relatively close, northwest of my position\n- (3, 4): Close to (3, 5)\n- (9, 9): Far corner\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\nI've been incredibly successful collecting 4 apples in a row! Now I need to plan my path to the remaining apples. The apples at (3, 4) and (3, 5) are relatively close - I could potentially target those next. The apple at (5, 4) is also reasonable.\n\n**Movement Analysis:**\nFrom (2, 1), if I want to head toward the cluster of apples around (3, 4) and (3, 5):\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 1) gets me closer to the x-coordinate of those apples\n- Moving UP to (2, 2) also moves me toward (3, 5) but prioritizes y-movement\n- Moving LEFT to (1, 1) moves me away from most remaining apples\n\n**Safety Considerations:**\nAll three legal moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) appear safe with no immediate collision risks. The enemy snake is still far away around (3, 7).\n\n**Optimal Path Planning:**\nTo reach (3, 4) or (3, 5), I need to move both right and up. Moving RIGHT to (3, 1) first seems efficient as it gets me to the correct x-coordinate for both target apples, then I can move up from there.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3, 1), I'll be positioned to move UP toward either (3, 4) or (3, 5). I should continue moving UP to collect these apples while being mindful of the enemy snake's position.\n\nRIGHT",

That's where my body segment is now\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 2)**: Safe empty space\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- Closest apple is at (5, 4) - just 2 moves away if I go RIGHT then UP twice\n- Other apples: (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 9), (7, 0)\n\n**Enemy Snake Positioning:**\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 4), so it's still relatively close but no longer in direct collision path with me. The enemy has a long body and seems to be occupying much of the left side of the board.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. **Apple at (5, 4)**: This is very accessible - I can reach it by going RIGHT to (5, 2), then UP to (5, 3), then UP to (5, 4)\n2. **Safe Path**: Moving RIGHT keeps me away from the enemy snake and gives me good positioning\n3. **Future Options**: Going RIGHT toward (5, 2) sets me up well for multiple apple choices\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- RIGHT to (5, 2): Very safe, moves toward apple at (5, 4)\n- UP to (4, 3): Safe but doesn't optimize apple collection\n- DOWN to (4, 1): Safe but moves away from most apples\n\n**Decision:**\nI should continue RIGHT to (5, 2). This puts me in perfect position to grab the apple at (5, 4) in just two more moves (UP, UP). It also keeps me well away from the enemy snake while maintaining good positioning for other apples on the right side of the board.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After reaching (5, 2), move UP toward (5, 3) to continue approaching the apple at (5, 4). Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position but focus on efficient apple collection since I have a clear path.\n\nRIGHT",

UP: To (3, 5) - This is my own body, so not viable.\n2. DOWN: To (3, 3) - This is safe, no obstacles here.\n3. LEFT: To (2, 4) - This is safe, no obstacles here.\n4. RIGHT: To (4, 4) - This is safe and moves me toward the apple at (5, 4).\n\n## Decision Making\n\nI have three viable moves: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 4) would be the best option as it moves me directly toward the nearest apple at (5, 4). This is a safe move as there are no obstacles in that direction. After this move, I'll be in position to collect the apple at (5, 4) on my next turn.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3, 3) would be safe but doesn't get me closer to any apples. Also, I need to be careful as the enemy snake's head is at (4, 2), so there's potential danger if I move further down.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2, 4) would be safe but takes me away from the closest apple.\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (4, 4), I'll evaluate whether to continue RIGHT to get the apple at (5, 4) or potentially adjust based on the enemy snake's movement. I'll need to be mindful of the enemy snake which is currently at (4, 2) and could potentially move up.\n\nRIGHT",

This creates a dangerous situation. If I try to move UP to (5, 4), I'll collide with the enemy snake and die.\n\n**Immediate Movement Options from (5, 3):**\n1. **UP to (5, 4)**: DEATH! Enemy snake head is there\n2. **DOWN to (5, 2)**: DEATH! That's where my body segment is\n3. **LEFT to (4, 3)**: Safe empty space\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 3)**: Safe empty space\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- Apple at (5, 4): No longer accessible due to enemy snake\n- Apple at (9, 4): 4 moves away going RIGHT\n- Apple at (9, 3): 4 moves away going RIGHT \n- Apple at (9, 9): Further away\n- Apple at (7, 0): Requires going down then right\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI need to pivot immediately. Going RIGHT toward the apples at (9, 4) and (9, 3) seems like the best option. The enemy snake just blocked my path to the closest apple, but I can still compete for the apples on the right side of the board.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 3) keeps me safe and starts my journey toward the cluster of apples at x=9. From there, I can continue RIGHT and have good access to multiple apples.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving RIGHT toward the apples at (9, 3) and (9, 4). The enemy snake may have trapped itself somewhat by going for that apple, giving me an opportunity to score on the right side of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

UP: To (5, 5) - This appears safe, no obstacles here.\n2. DOWN: To (5, 3) - This is where the enemy snake's head is, so this would cause a collision. Not viable.\n3. LEFT: To (4, 4) - This is my own body, so not viable.\n4. RIGHT: To (6, 4) - This appears safe, no obstacles here.\n\nLooking at my options, I have two safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\n## Decision Making\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 4) would put me on a path toward the cluster of apples at (9, 3) and (9, 4). This seems like a good directional strategy to maximize apple collection.\n\nMoving UP to (5, 5) would start me on a path toward the apple at (5, 7). This is also a good option as it's closer than the apples on the right side.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's position as well. They're at (5, 3) and could potentially move to (6, 3), (5, 4), or (4, 3) on their next turn. Since I'll be vacating (5, 4), the enemy could take that position. If I move RIGHT and the enemy moves UP, there could be a potential future collision to be mindful of.\n\nThe UP move seems slightly safer given the enemy snake's current position, and it takes me toward the apple at (5, 7) which is closer than the other apples.\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\nAfter moving UP to (5, 5), I'll be one step closer to the apple at (5, 7). I'll need to continue moving upward to reach it, while monitoring the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake moves in a way that threatens my path, I can reassess and potentially change direction toward the cluster of apples on the right side of the board.\n\nUP",

I'll need to be careful not to trap myself against the wall or my own body. The enemy snake appears to be heading toward the apples at (9, 3) and (9, 4), so I may need to adjust my strategy if they get there first.

Continues toward the apple at (9, 9)\n2. **DOWN to (9, 3)**: DEATH! That's where my body is now\n3. **LEFT to (8, 4)**: Safe, but moves me away from the profitable right edge\n4. **RIGHT**: DEATH! Off the board\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\nI should continue UP toward (9, 9). This keeps me on the right edge where I have good control and gets me closer to the next apple. The path UP is completely clear - I can see positions (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8) are all empty, leading to the apple at (9, 9).\n\nThe enemy snake is still focused on the left-center area around (7, 7) and doesn't seem to be threatening my right-edge territory yet.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue the right-edge dominance! After moving UP to (9, 5), I'll keep pushing toward (9, 9) for the third apple. Once I collect that, I can reassess - either go for the apple at (9, 1) by moving back down the right edge, or potentially venture toward other apples if the coast is clear.\n\nThis right-edge strategy is proving very effective - I'm collecting apples efficiently while staying away from the enemy snake.\n\nUP",

Going DOWN would put me adjacent to this apple, which I could then grab on my next turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT would get me closer to the apples at (9, 9) and (9, 1), but I need to be careful not to trap myself against the right wall.\n\nMoving UP would give me more space but take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think DOWN is the best move. It positions me next to the apple at (6, 6), which I can collect on my next turn. This is a safe and immediate opportunity for growth.\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (7, 6), I should be positioned to collect the apple at (6, 6) by moving LEFT. After that, I'll need to decide whether to continue down toward the apple at (7, 0) or move right toward the apples in the bottom right.

Off the board\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\nThis is a no-brainer situation. I have a clear, safe path to an apple that's just 2 moves away. The enemy snake moved down to (6, 5), so it's not threatening my right-edge territory. I should continue with my plan to collect the (9, 9) apple.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\nAfter moving UP to (9, 8), I'll be just 1 move away from the apple at (9, 9). Next turn I should move UP again to (9, 9) to collect the apple and grow. After that, I can consider going for the apple at (9, 1) by moving down the right edge, maintaining my territorial advantage on the right side of the board.\n\nUP",

UP: To (6, 6) - This would hit my own body at (6, 6), so not viable.\n2. DOWN: To (6, 4) - This appears to be a safe move with no obstacles.\n3. LEFT: To (5, 5) - This would hit my own body at (5, 5), so not viable.\n4. RIGHT: To (7, 5) - This is an empty space, so this move is viable.\n\n## Decision Making\n\nI have two viable options: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nMoving DOWN would continue my path toward the bottom of the board, potentially setting me up to reach the apple at (7, 0) eventually.\n\nMoving RIGHT would take me to (7, 5), which is an open space. From there, I could potentially navigate down toward the apple at (7, 0) or consider other paths.\n\nLooking at the longer-term strategy, moving RIGHT gives me more flexibility for subsequent moves. If I move DOWN, I'll need to be careful not to trap myself between my own body parts.\n\nThe RIGHT move also keeps more options open regarding future pathfinding toward apples. From (7, 5), I could potentially go DOWN next turn to (7, 4) and continue working my way toward the apple at (7, 0).\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (7, 5), I'll likely want to move DOWN to (7, 4) and continue toward the apple at (7, 0), but I'll need to reconsider based on how the board changes. I need to be careful of not trapping myself between my body segments and keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nRIGHT",

I've grown and gained a point.\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n- My head is at (9, 9) - top right corner\n- My body now extends down from (9, 8) along the right edge to (9, 3), then goes left to (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), and down to (5, 2)\n- I'm in a corner, so I need to be careful about my next move\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (7, 4) and doesn't pose an immediate threat\n\n**Available Apples:**\n- (7, 0) - bottom area\n- (9, 1) - right edge, could be accessible \n- (1, 5) - left side\n- (0, 6) - far left\n- (2, 8) - left side, top area\n\n**Movement Options:**\n1. **UP**: DEATH! Off the board\n2. **DOWN to (9, 8)**: DEATH! That's where my body is now\n3. **RIGHT**: DEATH! Off the board  \n4. **LEFT to (8, 9)**: SAFE! This is my only viable option\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\nI have no choice but to move LEFT to (8, 9). This will start me along the top edge of the board. From there, I can plan my next moves to target the available apples.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\nAfter moving to (8, 9), I should consider:\n- Continue LEFT along the top edge to eventually reach the apple at (2, 8)\n- Or move DOWN at some point to navigate toward other apples\n- The apple at (9, 1) might be reachable if I can loop around, but I need to be careful not to trap myself\n- Keep an eye on enemy snake #1's movements\n\nThe top edge gives me some breathing room to plan my next apple collection route.\n\nLEFT",

UP: To (7, 5) - This would hit my own body at (7, 5), so not viable.\n2. DOWN: To (7, 3) - This is an empty space, so this move is viable.\n3. LEFT: To (6, 4) - This would hit my own body at (6, 5), so not viable.\n4. RIGHT: To (8, 4) - This is an empty space, so this move is viable.\n\n## Decision Making\n\nI have two viable options: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7, 3) would continue my path toward the apple at (7, 0), which is my closest apple. There's a clear path straight down to it.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 4) would take me away from my immediate apple target and put me in a position where I'd need to navigate around the enemy snake's tail which extends to (8, 3).\n\nThe most efficient strategy is to continue DOWN toward the apple at (7, 0). This is the closest apple to me and requires the least number of moves to reach. After collecting this apple, I can reassess which apple to target next.\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (7, 3), I'll want to continue DOWN to (7, 2), (7, 1), and finally to (7, 0) to collect the apple. Once I've collected this apple, I'll need to decide whether to head toward the apple at (9, 1) or turn left and circle back toward the apples on the left side of the board. I'll need to be careful of the enemy snake's position when making this decision.\n\nDOWN",
