Let's evaluate each direction.\n\n- UP: from (0,0) to (0,1). This is safe (on board, not into my body, not into enemy bodies). It moves me toward the apple at (2,2).\n- DOWN: from (0,0) to (0,-1). This is off the board, so I die. Not allowed.\n- LEFT: from (0,0) to (-1,0). This is off the board, so I die. Not allowed.\n- RIGHT: from (0,0) to (1,0). This is into the head of snake #0. According to the rules, if two snake heads move into the same cell, both die. So this is not allowed.\n\nThe only safe moves are UP and RIGHT. But RIGHT will kill me, so it is eliminated. Only UP is safe.\n\nLet me verify the other snakes' moves. The rules say all snakes move simultaneously. I don't know what the other snakes will choose, but I must avoid moves that kill me regardless of what they do. Moving into another snake's body or head kills me. Moving into an enemy head is a head-on collision and I die.\n\nSnake #0's head is at (1,0). If I move RIGHT to (1,0), I move into snake #0's head. That's a head-on collision, I die. So RIGHT is eliminated.\n\nSnake #0's body is only its head, so no body to worry about.\n\nSo my safe moves are UP and RIGHT. RIGHT is into an enemy head, so it's not safe. Only UP is safe.\n\nTherefore, I should move UP.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (0,1). This is the only safe move. It brings me closer to the apple at (2,2) and keeps my options open for future moves. I should aim to continue moving northeast toward the apple, being careful not to run into snake #0's head.\n\nUP",

Let me evaluate the strategic value:\n\n- **LEFT** moves me directly onto the apple at (3,4). This is the most direct way to gain another apple and increase my score.\n- **UP** moves me away from the apple cluster and closer to the edge of the board.\n- **DOWN** moves me away from the apple cluster.\n- **RIGHT** moves me away from the apple cluster but keeps me at a safer distance from the enemy snake.\n\n**PLAN**\n\nThe best immediate option is LEFT, which moves me directly onto the apple at (3,4). This is the most direct way to gain another apple and increase my score. This will put me at 3 apples, one away from the winning condition.\n\nLEFT",
