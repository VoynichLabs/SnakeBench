No immediate apple.\n\nNeither of the first available moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) leads directly to an apple. However, moving RIGHT to (2, 3) opens up potential access to more apples subsequently.\n\nIf I think about maximizing my points in further moves, grabbing the apple at (2, 6) would take a bit of planning, as I would need to navigate up to y = 6.

No immediate apple.\n- If I move LEFT to (0, 3): The next moves can also be evaluated similarly, leading to no immediate apple.\n- If I move RIGHT to (2, 3): Next moves include (2, 4) (UP), (2, 2) (DOWN), (1, 3) (LEFT - backward), or (3, 3) (RIGHT). No immediate apple.\n\nNeither of the first available moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) leads directly to an apple. However, moving RIGHT to (2, 3) opens up potential access to more apples subsequently.\n\nIf I think about maximizing my points in further moves, grabbing the apple at (2, 6) would take a bit of planning, as I would need to navigate up to y = 6. Thus, moving toward (2, 3) may also more likely lead to favorable moves afterward as there are still directions to explore (2, 4), leading toward the apple at (5, 4) too.\n\nConsidering all options and the strategic outlook regarding nearby apples, I will move **RIGHT** to (2, 3).\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

There\u2019s no immediate apple to grab, but I\u2019m open to other positions. \n- If I move DOWN to (1, 2): Next possible moves could be (1, 1) (DOWN), (1, 3) (UP - backward), (0, 2) (LEFT), or (2, 2) (RIGHT). No immediate apple.\n- If I move LEFT to (0, 3): The next moves can also be evaluated similarly, leading to no immediate apple.\n- If I move RIGHT to (2, 3): Next moves include (2, 4) (UP), (2, 2) (DOWN), (1, 3) (LEFT - backward), or (3, 3) (RIGHT). No immediate apple.\n\nNeither of the first available moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) leads directly to an apple. However, moving RIGHT to (2, 3) opens up potential access to more apples subsequently.\n\nIf I think about maximizing my points in further moves, grabbing the apple at (2, 6) would take a bit of planning, as I would need to navigate up to y = 6. Thus, moving toward (2, 3) may also more likely lead to favorable moves afterward as there are still directions to explore (2, 4), leading toward the apple at (5, 4) too.\n\nConsidering all options and the strategic outlook regarding nearby apples, I will move **RIGHT** to (2, 3).\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

This leads me into position to grab the apple in the subsequent turn.\n\n### Future Planning:\nMy next immediate goal is to reach (2, 9) to collect an apple.

There\u2019s no immediate apple to grab, but I\u2019m open to other positions. \n- If I move DOWN to (1, 2): Next possible moves could be (1, 1) (DOWN), (1, 3) (UP - backward), (0, 2) (LEFT), or (2, 2) (RIGHT). No immediate apple.\n- If I move LEFT to (0, 3): The next moves can also be evaluated similarly, leading to no immediate apple.\n- If I move RIGHT to (2, 3): Next moves include (2, 4) (UP), (2, 2) (DOWN), (1, 3) (LEFT - backward), or (3, 3) (RIGHT). No immediate apple.\n\nNeither of the first available moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) leads directly to an apple. However, moving RIGHT to (2, 3) opens up potential access to more apples subsequently.\n\nIf I think about maximizing my points in further moves, grabbing the apple at (2, 6) would take a bit of planning, as I would need to navigate up to y = 6. Thus, moving toward (2, 3) may also more likely lead to favorable moves afterward as there are still directions to explore (2, 4), leading toward the apple at (5, 4) too.\n\nConsidering all options and the strategic outlook regarding nearby apples, I will move **RIGHT** to (2, 3).\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

No immediate apple.\n\nNeither of the first available moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) leads directly to an apple. However, moving RIGHT to (2, 3) opens up potential access to more apples subsequently.\n\nIf I think about maximizing my points in further moves, grabbing the apple at (2, 6) would take a bit of planning, as I would need to navigate up to y = 6.

As long as I stay on the right side of the board, I will avoid directly confronting it. Their current coordinates do not pose an immediate threat to my route to the right.\n\n### Future Planning\nIn this context:\n- **DOWN to (6, 8)** might not bring me any closer to the apples, whereas **RIGHT to (7, 9)** puts me one step closer to potentially reaching (9, 8) and (9, 9) in my next moves.\n- The right side is relatively open, and pressing forward seems the best way to not only score points but avoid any confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nBased on this analysis, I have decided on my move.\n\nDecided next move: **RIGHT**."

It also brings my snake closer to (5, 6), potentially setting me up for collecting that apple soon. \n- Keeping an eye on the enemy and making sure I don\u2019t get trapped or outmaneuvered is essential.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nAfter analyzing the options and considering the implications of each, I will move **LEFT to (5, 8)**.

There\u2019s no immediate apple to grab, but I\u2019m open to other positions. \n- If I move DOWN to (1, 2): Next possible moves could be (1, 1) (DOWN), (1, 3) (UP - backward), (0, 2) (LEFT), or (2, 2) (RIGHT). No immediate apple.\n- If I move LEFT to (0, 3): The next moves can also be evaluated similarly, leading to no immediate apple.\n- If I move RIGHT to (2, 3): Next moves include (2, 4) (UP), (2, 2) (DOWN), (1, 3) (LEFT - backward), or (3, 3) (RIGHT). No immediate apple.\n\nNeither of the first available moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) leads directly to an apple. However, moving RIGHT to (2, 3) opens up potential access to more apples subsequently.\n\nIf I think about maximizing my points in further moves, grabbing the apple at (2, 6) would take a bit of planning, as I would need to navigate up to y = 6. Thus, moving toward (2, 3) may also more likely lead to favorable moves afterward as there are still directions to explore (2, 4), leading toward the apple at (5, 4) too.\n\nConsidering all options and the strategic outlook regarding nearby apples, I will move **RIGHT** to (2, 3).\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

However, moving **LEFT to (2, 7)** could strategically set me up for the following turns to claim the (2, 9) apple more directly. \n\n### Conclusion:\nConsidering the proximity of the apples, positioning, and avoiding the enemy snake while ensuring I'm not restricted by my body, my next move should be to go **LEFT to (2, 7)**.

There\u2019s no immediate apple to grab, but I\u2019m open to other positions. \n- If I move DOWN to (1, 2): Next possible moves could be (1, 1) (DOWN), (1, 3) (UP - backward), (0, 2) (LEFT), or (2, 2) (RIGHT).

No immediate apple.\n\nNeither of the first available moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) leads directly to an apple. However, moving RIGHT to (2, 3) opens up potential access to more apples subsequently.\n\nIf I think about maximizing my points in further moves, grabbing the apple at (2, 6) would take a bit of planning, as I would need to navigate up to y = 6. Thus, moving toward (2, 3) may also more likely lead to favorable moves afterward as there are still directions to explore (2, 4), leading toward the apple at (5, 4) too.\n\nConsidering all options and the strategic outlook regarding nearby apples, I will move **RIGHT** to (2, 3).\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

However, moving **LEFT to (2, 7)** could strategically set me up for the following turns to claim the (2, 9) apple more directly. \n\n### Conclusion:\nConsidering the proximity of the apples, positioning, and avoiding the enemy snake while ensuring I'm not restricted by my body, my next move should be to go **LEFT to (2, 7)**.
