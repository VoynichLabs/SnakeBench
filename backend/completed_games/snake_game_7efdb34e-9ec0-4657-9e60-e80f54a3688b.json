The enemy snake is directly adjacent to me, my body blocks going up, and the wall blocks going right. My only safe move is DOWN again.\n\n**Remaining Apples:**\n- (9, 8): 0 right, 5 up = 5 moves (closest once I can move up)\n- (6, 3): 3 left, 0 up/down = 3 moves (very close horizontally)\n- (3, 1): 6 left, 2 down = 8 moves\n- (5, 0): 4 left, 3 down = 7 moves\n- (5, 5): 4 left, 2 up = 6 moves\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (9, 2), I need to assess:\n1. Where the enemy snake moves - hopefully away from blocking my path\n2. My body will shift up: new body will be at [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)]\n3. Consider if I can start moving LEFT toward the apple at (6, 3) which is quite close\n4. Or continue DOWN and then work my way around to access apples\n\nThe enemy snake's proximity is very concerning - it's essentially trapping me against the right wall. I need to create distance and find a path to the apples.\n\n**Next turn strategy:** From (9, 2), if the enemy snake moves away, consider going LEFT to start accessing the middle area of the board where most apples are located.

That's where my neck/first body segment is\n- LEFT to (4, 5): Safe, empty space  \n- RIGHT to (6, 5): Safe, empty space\n\n**Available Apple Targets:**\n- Apple at (5, 8): 3 moves directly UP - excellent continuation of my strategy\n- Apple at (9, 8): 4 moves right, 3 moves up\n- Apple at (0, 5): Same row but too close to enemy snake territory\n- Apple at (9, 1): 4 moves right, 4 moves down\n- Apple at (4, 3): 1 move left, 2 moves down\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nPerfect! My plan is working exactly as intended. I collected the apple at (5, 5) and now I'm in prime position to continue UP toward the apple at (5, 8). This keeps me in the central column where I have good control and multiple escape routes.\n\nThe enemy snake is still far away at (2, 9), so no immediate threat. Continuing UP maintains my strong position and gets me closer to another easy apple.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:** After moving to (5, 6), I'll continue UP to (5, 7), then UP again to (5, 8) to collect the second apple. This gives me excellent board control in the center while keeping distance from the enemy snake.\n\nUP"

The enemy snake is currently far away from both apples, so I have some flexibility in my decision.\n\nMoving towards the apple at (0, 5) would require a longer path, but it would also allow me to stay near the walls and potentially limit the enemy snake's movement options.
