Our snake is at (7,0) and the enemy is at (4,9). \n\nLet me scan the board - we've got apples at (8, 1), (1, 3), (5, 1), (7, 7), (9, 8), (9, 3), (3, 5), (8, 8), (9, 7), (7, 9), (2, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (5, 7).\n\nOur snake is on the bottom right, enemy is on the top left. We need to get moving!\n\nChecking our safe moves:\n- UP to (7,1): SAFE! No body there yet, within bounds\n- DOWN to (7,-1): OFF BOARD - DEAD\n- LEFT to (6,0): SAFE! Clear path\n- RIGHT to (8,0): SAFE! Clear path\n\nThree safe moves! Let's think strategy - we want to start controlling territory and heading toward apples.\n\nLooking at the closest apples:\n- (8,1) is just UP from us - that's RIGHT THERE!\n- (6,2) and (5,1) are also nearby if we go LEFT\n- (7,7) is straight UP but further\n\nIf we go UP to (7,1), we're immediately threatening (8,1) - that's a quick apple score!\n\nBut wait - if we go LEFT to (6,0), we can threaten multiple apples (6,2) and (5,1) while also positioning to cut off the enemy's access to the right side.\n\nThe enemy at (4,9) is pretty far - they'll probably head down toward the apples in the middle. If we go UP, we might meet them in the middle too soon.\n\nI'm thinking UP gives us better board control and multiple apple options. Plus it keeps our options open for next turn.\n\nUP\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nYo chat, let's get aggressive! We're starting at (7,0) and need to dominate this board. \n\nFirst priority: eat that apple at (8,1) - it's RIGHT THERE! We can get it in 2-3 moves max.\n\nSecond: keep an eye on the enemy. They're at (4,9) which is far away, but they'll probably head down toward the center apples. We need to control the right side of the board.\n\nStrategy for next few turns:\n1. Head UP to (7,1) then RIGHT toward (8,1)\n2. Once we eat that first apple, we'll have more options\n3. Try to box the enemy into the left side while we control the right\n4. Watch for head-on collision opportunities - if we have more apples, we can force a win!\n\nRemember: no dying! Stay alive, eat apples, and control territory.

No immediate collision.  \n- By snagging the apple at (7,\u202f7) next turn you\u2019ll place your head on the same vertical line as #1\u2019s possible leftward crawl, letting you **tighten the corridor** and force a crash when you later move **DOWN** into column\u202f9 while #1 is forced to go **LEFT** into the same row.  \n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **LONG\u2011TERM BATTLE PLAN (for next\u202f2\u20113 turns)**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f9** \u2013 **LEFT** to **(8,\u202f7)** \u2192 keep your length intact, set the stage for the apple at (7,\u202f7).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f10** \u2013 **LEFT** again to **(7,\u202f7)** \u2192 *boom*\u202f+1 segment! You now have **7\u202funits** and a solid horizontal bar across row\u202f7 (7\u2011to\u20119).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f11** \u2013 **DOWN** (to (7,\u202f6) \u2192 (7,\u202f5) \u2192 etc.) to **fill column\u202f9** from the top down, turning it into an impenetrable \u201cwall\u201d. This squeezes #1\u2019s escape routes, forcing them to either run into our wall or die on an apple\u2011free space.  \n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **TRAP\u2011AVOIDANCE** \u2013 By staying on column\u202f9 only for a few moves and then shifting back left, you\u2019ll keep a **parallel safe lane** (row\u202f7\u20118) open, preventing self\u2011encapsulation.  \n\n\u2705 **CHOICE** \u2013 The move that **maximizes immediate growth** and **creates the biggest future choke\u2011point** is **LEFT**. It lets you snag the apple at (7,\u202f7) on the very next turn and start building that death\u2011trap wall.  \n\nLEFT",

Let's break this down!\n\nWe're at turn 10 with our snake at (8,5) and the enemy at (8,7). \n\nLet me scan the board - we've got apples at (1, 3), (5, 1), (7, 7), (3, 5), (2, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (5, 7), (2, 2), (7, 5), (0, 3), (2, 3), (1, 7), (3, 7), (8, 2).\n\nOur snake is at (8,5) with body [(8,4), (9,4)] and the enemy is at (8,7) with body [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)].\n\nChecking our safe moves:\n- UP to (8,6): SAFE! Clear path\n- DOWN to (8,4): DEAD! That's our own body segment\n- LEFT to (7,5): SAFE! Clear path\n- RIGHT to (9,5): SAFE! Clear path\n\nWe've got THREE safe moves! UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are all options.\n\nThe enemy at (8,7) is right above us - they're trapped on the right edge with their body stretching left along the top. If they go DOWN to (8,6), we could have a head-on collision! But they can't go RIGHT or UP - they're boxed in by the edge and their own body!\n\nIf they go LEFT to (7,7), we need to be careful. Let's look at the board - there's an apple at (7,5) which is two spaces down from our current position. If we go DOWN we'd hit our own body, so that's not an option.\n\nThe enemy has apples: 5, we have apples: 2. We're behind! We need to be aggressive and force confrontations when we can win them.\n\nIf they go DOWN to (8,6) and we go UP to (8,6), that's a head-on collision! But wait - they have 5 apples and we have 2. In a head-on collision, BOTH snakes die, but the snake with MORE apples wins! They'd win that collision.\n\nLet's avoid that head-on collision for now. We should go LEFT to (7,5) to start moving toward that apple at (7,5) while keeping our options open. This also puts us in a better position to potentially box them in later!\n\nLEFT\n\n**START STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS**\nWe're at (7,5) with body [(8,5), (8,4), (9,4)]. The enemy is at (8,7) with body [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)].\n\nWe need to focus on eating apples to catch up! There's one at (7,5) - let's go get it next turn if we can. After that, we should look to move toward the center of the board where there are more apples available.\n\nThe enemy is trapped on the right edge - we should try to use our body to block their escape routes and force them into bad positions. Remember, we have fewer apples so we can afford to be more aggressive in head-on collisions.\n\nKeep an eye on the apple at (5,7) - that's in a good central location we should target.\n**END STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS**",

That wall blocks every path the opponent could take **UP** through column\u202f9 and forces them to stay on row\u202f5\u20114.  \n- By occupying (9,\u202f6) and (9,\u202f7) after the shift, a future **UP** from the enemy will land on **your body \u2192 instant kill**.  \n- **DOWN** also hits (9,\u202f6) but doesn\u2019t lock the whole row\u202f7, leaving a gap at (7,\u202f7) that the opponent can exploit later by sneaking left under you.  \n- **UP** is the weakest \u2013 no apple, no barrier, and the enemy stays unpressured.  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **STRATEGY NOTE**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f12** \u2013 **LEFT** to (6,\u202f7) \u2192 complete row\u202f7 wall, gain no apple but a massive choke point.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f13** \u2013 **DOWN** to (6,\u202f6) \u2192 start a vertical spine down column\u202f6, further squeezing the opponent toward the left\u2011bottom.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f14** \u2013 **DOWN** again (to (6,\u202f5)) or **LEFT** into the column the enemy is forced into, creating a forced head\u2011on where you have the longer snake \u2192 they die, you win.  \n\nRemember: the moment the enemy tries to climb your wall, they\u2019re **game\u2011over**.

Let's break this down!\n\nWe're at turn 11 with our snake at (9,5) and the enemy at (7,7). \n\nLet me scan the board - we've got apples at (1, 3), (5, 1), (3, 5), (2, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (5, 7), (2, 2), (7, 5), (0, 3), (2, 3), (1, 7), (3, 7), (8, 2), (7, 8).\n\nOur snake is at (9,5) with body [(8,5), (8,4)] and the enemy is at (7,7) with body [(8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)].\n\nChecking our safe moves:\n- UP to (9,6): SAFE! Clear path\n- DOWN to (9,4): DEAD! That's our own body segment\n- LEFT to (8,5): DEAD! That's our own body segment\n- RIGHT to (10,5): DEAD! Off the board!\n\nWe've got ONE safe move! Only UP to (9,6) is available.\n\nThe enemy at (7,7) is stuck on the right edge with their body stretching left along the top. They can't go RIGHT or UP - they're boxed in by the edge and their own body!\n\nWe need to keep moving upward to position ourselves for that apple at (7,5) while keeping our options open. The enemy has 6 apples and we have 2 - we're way behind! We need to be aggressive and force confrontations when we can win them.\n\nUP\n\n**START STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS**\nWe're at (9,6) with body [(9,5), (8,5), (8,4)]. The enemy is at (7,7) with body [(8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)].\n\nWe need to keep moving upward to position ourselves for that apple at (7,5) while keeping our options open. The enemy is trapped on the right edge - we should try to use our body to block their escape routes and force them into bad positions. Remember, we have fewer apples so we can afford to be more aggressive in head-on collisions.\n\nKeep an eye on the apple at (5,7) - that's in a good central location we should target once we get closer to the center of the board.\n**END STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS**",
