Apples everywhere, but we're playing for board control early.\n\nLet's check moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (3,5). Safe? In bounds, no bodies there. Enemy not adjacent. Good.\n\nDOWN \u2192 (3,3). Safe? In bounds, clear. Good.\n\nLEFT \u2192 (2,4). Safe? In bounds, clear. Good.\n\nRIGHT \u2192 (4,4). Safe? In bounds, clear. Good.\n\nAll four moves safe right now. But we need to think about the enemy's possible moves from (6,7). He could go DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), RIGHT to (7,7), UP to (6,8). None threaten us directly this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to pressure him, maybe move toward center or cut off his space. He's top-right, we're mid-left. If we go UP to (3,5), we get closer to some apples at (3,8) and (4,7) eventually, and also move toward the middle. Going RIGHT to (4,4) also moves toward center but maybe less aggressive.\n\nActually, thinking about boxing him in later \u2014 we need to grow first. So maybe go for an apple soon, but not this turn \u2014 no apple adjacent.\n\nBut most important: keep options open. From (3,5), next turn we could go UP, LEFT, RIGHT, maybe DOWN (unless we grow). That's good.\n\nFrom (3,3), similar.\n\nI think UP is solid \u2014 moves toward top half where enemy is, sets up potential to intercept or cut off.\n\nChat, what do you think? UP feels like we're advancing, not backing down. We stay aggressive. Let's lock it in.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move toward center/top, watch enemy movement, try to get between him and open space. Grow when safe to get length advantage for head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

We need to be AGGRESSIVE but smart.\n\nFirst, check all moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (3,7). In bounds. Clear of our body (we have none). Enemy body is at (5,7) \u2014 not same cell. \u2705  \n**DOWN** \u2192 (3,5). In bounds, clear. \u2705  \n**LEFT** \u2192 (2,6). In bounds, clear. \u2705  \n**RIGHT** \u2192 (4,6). In bounds, clear. \u2705  \n\nAll four are safe *immediately*. But we gotta think SIMULTANEOUS movement \u2014 where could enemy go from (5,6)?\n\nEnemy possible moves:  \nUP to (5,7) \u2014 that's his own body, so he'd die. He won't pick that.  \nDOWN to (5,5) \u2014 safe.  \nLEFT to (4,6) \u2014 ah! That's our RIGHT move target! If we go RIGHT to (4,6) and he goes LEFT to (4,6), head-on collision \u2014 we both die. He has higher score, so that's bad for us. \u274c Avoid RIGHT unless we're sure he won't go LEFT.  \nRIGHT to (6,6) \u2014 safe.\n\nSo RIGHT is risky \u2014 possible head-on if he goes LEFT.\n\nNow, apples: closest apples to us are (3,8) above, (4,7) up-right, (2,8) up-left. Moving UP gets us closer to those.\n\nLong-term plan: We need to grow to match his length, then force him into a bad spot. He's to our right, with body above him at (5,7), so he can't go UP. That means his likely moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. If he goes LEFT, he risks collision with us if we go RIGHT. But we don't want to risk it yet since he's longer.\n\nBetter to go **UP** \u2014 claim space toward top apples, stay out of direct line, and from (3,7) next turn we can threaten to cut him off from the top apples. Also, from (3,7), our possible next moves are still open.\n\nLet's think about boxing: If we go UP, we're closer to top wall, could later move right to squeeze him. He's at (5,6) with body at (5,7), so his upward path is blocked by his own body \u2014 he's kinda trapped vertically. We can exploit that by controlling rows above him.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Grow safely by taking apple at (3,8) or (4,7) soon. Keep enemy to our right, use top wall and left side to limit his movement. Avoid head-on until we have equal or greater length.\n\nUP",

We need to close that gap! But first, let's check our immediate moves.\n\n**UP** \u2192 (3,8). In bounds. Clear of our body (none). Enemy body at (5,6) \u2014 safe. Apple at (3,8) \u2014 YES! That's an instant grow! \ud83c\udf4e  \n**DOWN** \u2192 (3,6). In bounds, clear. No apple.  \n**LEFT** \u2192 (2,7). In bounds, clear. No apple.  \n**RIGHT** \u2192 (4,7). In bounds, clear. Apple at (4,7) \u2014 also a grow! \ud83c\udf4e  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT both get us an apple immediately. But which is smarter?\n\nSimultaneous movement alert! Enemy at (4,6) can move:  \nUP to (4,7) \u2014 that's our RIGHT target! If we both go there, head-on collision \u2014 he has longer body, so we lose. \u274c  \nDOWN to (4,5) \u2014 safe.  \nLEFT to (3,6) \u2014 safe.  \nRIGHT to (5,6) \u2014 his own body, so he dies. He won't pick that.\n\nSo RIGHT is risky \u2014 possible head-on if he goes UP.\n\nWhat about UP to (3,8)? Could enemy reach (3,8) this turn? From (4,6), he'd need LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT \u2014 not possible in one move. So UP is safe from head-on.\n\nAlso, eating the apple at (3,8) grows us to length 2, matching his body length (head + 1 segment). Then we're equal in length! That means head-on collisions become neutral \u2014 we tie instead of lose. That's huge for future aggression! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLong-term plan: After eating, we'll have head at (3,8) and tail at (3,7). Next turn, we can push right to pressure him, maybe cut off his access to top apples. He's stuck with body at (5,6), limiting his UP movement. We can start boxing him toward the bottom-right.\n\nSo UP gets us the safe apple, equalizes length, and keeps options open. RIGHT gets an apple but risks death. DOWN and LEFT are safe but passive \u2014 we need to grow!\n\nChat, we're going for the power-up! Let's take that top apple and level the playing field! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

DOWN would dump me down to (4,5) which gives him breathing room and lets him slip away; LEFT to (3,6) could force a head-on if he drops down, but all I\u2019d be doing is dangling a collision and letting him drift sideways to (2,7). RIGHT is insta-death into my neck at (5,6), so that\u2019s not even in play. I\u2019m taking UP: it keeps the fight close, grows the length, and it traps him between us and the edge so I can start boxing him into a corner on the next few turns.\n\nPLAN: After I snag this apple on (4,7), stay on row 7 and use column 4 as a moving wall so he can\u2019t swing around to the left, then be ready to drop down and cut off any escape routes when he gets desperate.\n\nUP",

This is where the chokehold starts. \u2705  \n- RIGHT to (5,8) opens space, but gives him room to breathe and slide around the left side, and we lose the locking angle. Not ideal for a ruthless competitor like us. \u274c  \n- LEFT is locked by his body segment at (3,8), so that\u2019s a NO. \u274c  \n- DOWN is into my own body and insta-loss. \u274c\n\nWe\u2019ve got the lead 2-2?

He\u2019s got limited safe options, and I\u2019m going to keep stacking pressure. Who wants to let him slip out? Not us. Not today.\n\nPLAN: Keep hugging the top row, then shift left to (3,9) (and later (2,9) if it opens) so that we\u2019re circling that little pocket and giving him no breathing room. Force him into the dive toward the bottom while we stay up high and ready to cut him off. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Enemy head at **(4,8)**, body at [(4,7), (4,6)] \u2014 also length 3. We're tied in apples and length! That means head-on collision is a tie \u2014 but we want to WIN, not tie. So we can be more aggressive now!\n\n**Immediate danger check:**\n- **UP** \u2192 (2,9). In bounds. Apple at (2,9)! \ud83c\udf4e But check: enemy at (4,8) could move LEFT to (3,8) or UP to (4,9) or RIGHT to (5,8). He can't reach (2,9) in one move. Safe from head-on. Our body? Clear. \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,7). In bounds. No apple. Safe from enemy head-on? Enemy could move LEFT to (3,8) or DOWN to (4,7) (his own body \u2014 he'd die) or RIGHT to (5,8). Not (2,7). Safe. \u2705\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,8). In bounds. No apple. Safe from enemy? Yes. \u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,8). That's our own body segment! \u274c Moving into your own body kills you \u2014 even though tail moves, (3,8) is our neck, not tail. So RIGHT is instant death. Eliminated!\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**Strategic thinking:**\nUP gets us an apple \u2014 grows to length 4, enemy stays length 3. That gives us a length advantage! Then if we head-on collide next turn, HE dies, we survive! That's huge! But \u2014 eating apple means our tail stays put, so our body gets longer, possibly boxing us later. But worth it for the lead.\n\nDOWN moves us away from enemy and top edge \u2014 maybe too passive.\n\nLEFT moves us toward left wall \u2014 could limit options later.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** Enemy at (4,8) likely wants apple at (5,9) or (7,9) \u2014 he might go UP or RIGHT. If he goes RIGHT to (5,8), he's moving away. If he goes UP to (4,9), he's closer to apples but also closer to us if we go UP.\n\n**Head-on risk this turn?** Only if we end up in same cell. He can't reach (2,9), (2,7), or (1,8) from (4,8) in one move. So all safe.\n\n**Future mobility:** After UP to (2,9), next turn our head at top edge \u2014 only DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT available. But we'll have length 4 vs his 3 \u2014 we can pressure him toward the top-right corner!\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple, use length advantage to cut off his escape. He's at (4,8) \u2014 if we move to (3,9) or (2,9) now, we can try to get beside him and force him into a wall or his own body.\n\nUP seems best \u2014 get the apple, get longer, then hunt him down! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**Final move:** UP",

It also forces them to keep scooting left, which slows their escape. We eat, tie the score, and stay aggressive.\n\nPLAN: After gobbling (5,9), keep stacking pressure on the upper-right corridor, then work a shallow loop down so we can cut them off as they try to crawl toward the bottom.

WE GOT THE ADVANTAGE!\n\nOkay, current head at **(2,9)**, body: [(2,8), (3,8), (3,7)]. Enemy head at **(4,9)**, body: [(4,8), (4,7)].\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\n- **UP** \u2192 (2,10) \u274c OFF THE BOARD! DEATH. ELIMINATED.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,8). That's our own neck! \u274c That's our body segment from last turn! Moving backwards into your own body kills you! ELIMINATED.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,9). In bounds. Check: Apple at (1,9)! \ud83c\udf4e Enemy at (4,9) could move LEFT to (3,9) or DOWN to (4,8) or RIGHT to (5,9). He can't reach (1,9) in one move. Safe from head-on. Not our body. \u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,9). In bounds. No apple. Enemy could move LEFT to (3,9) \u2014 OH! That's a potential head-on collision! If we both go to (3,9), we both die. But we have length 4, he has length 3. Head-on with length advantage means HE dies, we survive? NO! Head-on collision kills BOTH regardless of length! So that's risky. But is it safe from his body? His body is at (4,8) and (4,7), so (3,9) is clear. So RIGHT is *conditionally* safe if he doesn't also go LEFT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (4,9). He can go UP? (4,10) off board \u274c. DOWN to (4,8) \u2014 that's his own body! He'd die! So DOWN is suicide for him. LEFT to (3,9) is possible. RIGHT to (5,9) is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e He'll likely go for the apple at (5,9) or avoid suicide. So most likely RIGHT to (5,9) for the apple and safety. Could he go LEFT to (3,9) to challenge us? Maybe, but he's shorter, so head-on kills him too \u2014 he'd be dumb to do that unless he's desperate.\n\n**OUR STRATEGY:** We have length advantage! We want to pressure him, cut off his space, maybe force him into a wall or his own body! If we go LEFT to (1,9), we eat an apple, grow to length 5, he stays 3 (if he doesn't eat). That's a MASSIVE lead! Then we can really box him in. Going RIGHT to (3,9) risks head-on if he goes LEFT, but if he doesn't, we get closer to him without growing. Which is better?\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY:** After LEFT to (1,9), we're on left edge. Next turn we can go DOWN, RIGHT, or UP? UP is off board, so DOWN or RIGHT. That's okay. After RIGHT to (3,9), we're more central, can go UP (off board), DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat the apple at (1,9), become length 5. Then use our long body to slowly encircle him from the left/top. He's trapped near top-right corner with walls at y=9 and x=9. We can move down and right to cut off his escape routes. If he eats the apple at (5,9), he grows to 4, but we're still longer. We must avoid letting him get multiple apples and catch up.\n\n**SAFETY FIRST:** RIGHT has head-on risk if he goes LEFT. Is that likely? He'd be choosing possible suicide (head-on) over apple at (5,9) or safe move? Probably not. But why risk it? LEFT is 100% safe from head-on, gets us an apple, grows our lead. LEFT seems smarter!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to (1,9), eat that apple, extend our dominance! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

Not my body, not enemy body.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 9) \u274c That's my own neck! My body segment from last turn \u2014 moving backwards into yourself kills you! ELIMINATED.  \n\nSo **DOWN** and **LEFT** are safe from immediate suicide.  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nEnemy at (5, 9). He can go:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 10) \u274c off board.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 8) \u2705 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 9) \u274c his own body! Suicide.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 9) \u2705 empty.  \n\nSo he **cannot go LEFT** without dying! He'll choose DOWN or RIGHT.  \nApple at (5, 9)? No, apple at (7, 9) and (9, 9) are far. He might go DOWN to (5, 8) to avoid wall, or RIGHT to (6, 9) to stay near top.  \n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**  \n- If I go DOWN to (1, 8), enemy can't reach (1, 8) in one move (he's at (5, 9)). Safe.  \n- If I go LEFT to (0, 9), enemy can't reach (0, 9) in one move. Safe.  \n\n**APPLE PROXIMITY:**  \nApple at (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1) \u2014 all far. No apples near (0, 9) or (1, 8).  \n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY & STRATEGY:**  \nWe have length advantage! We want to **trap him in the top-right corner**.  \n- If I go **LEFT** to (0, 9), I'm on the left edge \u2014 next turn only DOWN or RIGHT possible (UP off board). That's limiting.  \n- If I go **DOWN** to (1, 8), I'm more central \u2014 next turn can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP back to (1, 9) is my old body? Wait, next turn my tail moves, so (1, 9) might be free? Actually, after moving, my body will be: head (1, 8), then (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8). So (1, 9) is my body next turn, so UP would be suicide next turn. So from (1, 8), possible moves: DOWN to (1, 7), LEFT to (0, 8), RIGHT to (2, 8) \u2014 but (2, 8) is my body next turn! So RIGHT would be suicide next turn. So DOWN to (1, 8) actually leaves only DOWN or LEFT next turn. Hmm.  \n\nLet's think:  \nGoing **LEFT** to (0, 9): next turn body: head (0, 9), then (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8). From (0, 9), possible: DOWN to (0, 8) \u2705, RIGHT to (1, 9) \u274c (my body), UP \u274c off board. So only DOWN next turn. That's a dead-end path!  \n\nGoing **DOWN** to (1, 8): next turn body: head (1, 8), then (0, 9)? Wait, no \u2014 my body after moving DOWN: head (1, 8), then (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8). So from (1, 8) next turn:  \n- UP to (1, 9) \u274c my body  \n- DOWN to (1, 7) \u2705  \n- LEFT to (0, 8) \u2705  \n- RIGHT to (2, 8) \u274c my body  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT are safe next turn. That's **two options**, better than one!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe need to **circle around him** \u2014 he's stuck at top-right. Let's move down and left to come up from below, cutting off his escape. Avoid getting pinned on edges.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \nDOWN gives more flexibility next turn, avoids edge trap, and is safe from enemy head-on. Let's take it!  \n\nDOWN",

He'll likely go RIGHT to (7, 9) to eat the apple and grow to length 4. Or DOWN to (6, 8) to avoid the edge.

Going DOWN to (1, 7) keeps us central and gives more options to maneuver. Going LEFT to (0, 8) pins us on the edge slightly. With the enemy likely moving RIGHT toward (7, 9), we want to start encircling from below.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nDOWN gives more future mobility and keeps us aggressive. Let's move down and start the encirclement!  \n\nDOWN",

From (1, 6): UP to (1, 7) \u274c my body, DOWN to (1, 5) \u2705, LEFT to (0, 6) \u2705, RIGHT to (2, 6) \u2705 \u2192 **3 safe moves** next turn.\n- **LEFT to (0, 7):** Next turn, my body: head (0, 7), then (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8). From (0, 7): UP to (0, 8) \u2705, DOWN to (0, 6) \u2705, RIGHT to (1, 7) \u274c my body \u2192 **2 safe moves** next turn (edge limits).\n- **RIGHT to (2, 7):** Next turn, my body: head (2, 7), then (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8).

He's at (7,9) and will likely move DOWN or RIGHT. We should swing down and left to come up the left side, then cut across the bottom and up the right to trap him. Going DOWN to (1,6) keeps us central and flexible, moving toward the lower-left apples later. We want to avoid being near his head until we can force a head-on collision with our length advantage.\n\n**APPLE PROXIMITY:**\nApples at (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) are far south \u2014 moving DOWN gets us closer to them over time. No rush to eat now, but positioning to control the board is key.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN gives the most options next turn, avoids the enemy, and progresses our encirclement plan. LET'S MOVE!\n\nDOWN",

But if we grow to length 6, we tie length, then head-on is a draw \u2014 but we want to WIN. We need to trap him against the wall and force him to crash into us or himself.\n\nLook at the apple cluster bottom-left: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Moving DOWN gets us closer! We can snake around, eat those, grow to 6+, then swing up and cut off his escape from the right side.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:**\nWe want to cut off his path down from (9, 8). If we move RIGHT to (2,5), we're more central but farther from apples. DOWN to (1,4) puts us closer to apple cluster AND still central. LEFT to (0,5) traps us on the edge \u2014 bad mobility.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN gives mobility, moves toward apples, avoids enemy, and sets up a future trap. LET'S MOVE DOWN AND FEAST! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

LEFT to (6,8) keeps me hugging the top wall, keeps multiple follow-up escape routes, and keeps me on the offensive by maintaining the tight corridor over his head\u2014instead of letting him wiggle past me.\n\nSnake #0 is creeping at (1,2) with his spine running up column 1, so he\u2019s boxed in along the left wall and can\u2019t turn around easily.

Staying top-left keeps me ready to fold down to (6,7)/(6,6) next turn if he keeps pushing downward, and it keeps my body as a moving wall that restricts his options.\n\nPLAN NOTE: Keep circling the top band so I can swing down along the 6-column once he\u2019s locked against the left wall\u2014force the collision if he tries to cut toward me with equal apples.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN to (1,7) opens a bit, but honestly it loosens the column 1-2 squeeze we\u2019ve been tightening, and I don\u2019t want to give the rival any chance to slip out of the box we\u2019re drawing on the left side.

He's trapped on left edge still. He might go RIGHT toward (1,4) to try to escape the wall.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go UP to (5,6), he could go to (1,4) or (0,3) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (5,4), he could go to (1,4) \u2014 still far.\nIf we go RIGHT to (6,5), far from him.\nNo immediate head-on threat.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (5,6):** No apple. Length 12. Next turn body: head (5,6), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3) \u2014 wait that's 13 segments? Actually after moving without apple, tail moves off (1,3) so body length stays 11. From (5,6): UP (5,7) \u2705 empty, DOWN (5,5) \u274c body, LEFT (4,6) \u2705 empty, RIGHT (6,6) \u2705 empty. **3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT)**. Good mobility, top-center control.\n- **DOWN to (5,4):** No apple. From (5,4): UP (5,5) \u274c body, DOWN (5,3) \u2705 empty, LEFT (4,4) \u2705 empty, RIGHT (6,4) \u2705 apple there but ignore for now. **3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)**. Actually good mobility too! Downside: closer to bottom but not trapped.\n- **RIGHT to (6,5):** No apple. From (6,5): UP (6,6) \u2705 empty, DOWN (6,4) \u2705 apple, LEFT (5,5) \u274c body, RIGHT (7,5) \u2705 apple. **3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT)**. Good mobility, pushes into right side near apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWE NEED TO BOX HIM IN! Enemy is on left column, only moves DOWN or RIGHT. If he goes RIGHT to (1,4), we can later move left to cut off his escape upward. If we go DOWN to (5,4), we're closer to possibly intercept him if he moves right across row 4. If we go UP to (5,6), we're farther but control center. If we go RIGHT to (6,5), we're farther from him.\n\nBEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE? Let's think: He's at (0,4). If he goes RIGHT to (1,4), then next turn he could go UP (1,5), DOWN (1,3), RIGHT (2,4). We want to limit his space. If we go DOWN to (5,4), we're in same row y=4, 4 columns away \u2014 we can maybe move LEFT next turn to (4,4) then (3,4) etc to build a wall. But our body is at (3,4) already \u2014 so we already have a partial wall at x=3, y=4! Actually looking at board: (3,4) is our body segment! So row y=4 is blocked at x=3 by us. If he's at (1,4), he can't get past x=3 on row 4 because we're there! So if we stay in row 4, we can slowly advance leftward to squeeze him against left wall! YES! That's the play!\n\nSo DOWN to (5,4) keeps us in row 4, maintains mobility, and sets up a slow advance leftward to trap him! UP or RIGHT would take us away from the trapping row.\n\n**RISK:** If he goes DOWN to (0,3), he's in row 3 \u2014 but our body is at (3,3) too! So row 3 also blocked at x=3! He's in a vertical channel between left wall and our vertical body wall at x=3 from y=1 to y=4! He's already almost trapped! We just need to seal the top exit at y=5? Actually at y=5, our body is at (3,5) and (4,5) \u2014 so x=3,4 blocked at y=5. He can't go up to y=5 at x=0,1,2? Wait, (0,5) is his body, (1,5) empty, (2,5) empty. But to reach (2,5) he'd need to go from (0,4) to (1,4) to (2,4) to (2,5) \u2014 possible. But we can block that later.\n\nDOWN feels right to maintain pressure in that row! Let's go DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

TIME TO SQUEEZE HIM!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My head:** (5, 4) \u2014 just moved DOWN last turn! Length 12.\n- **My body:** [(5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2)] \u2014 wait, that\u2019s 11 body segments, plus head = 12 total. Yes.\n- **Enemy head:** (1, 4) \u2014 he moved RIGHT last turn! His body: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)] length 6 total.\n- **Apples nearby:** (6,4), (9,6), (0,0), (3,9), (9,3), (7,5), (8,6), (4,9) \u2014 but we ignore apples unless it's free content!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FROM (5,4):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (5, 5) \u274c MY OWN BODY (neck segment)\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 3) \u2705 EMPTY\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 4) \u2705 EMPTY\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 4) \u2705 APPLE THERE BUT WE IGNORE? Actually it's safe, just an apple.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT** \u2014 THREE OPTIONS AGAIN! NICE!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (1,4). His body: [(0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8)].\nFrom (1,4):\n- UP (1,5) \u2705 empty\n- DOWN (1,3) \u2705 empty\n- LEFT (0,4) \u274c HIS NECK\n- RIGHT (2,4) \u2705 empty\nHe has UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe. He's still near left wall but has more space now.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go DOWN to (5,3), he could go to (1,5), (1,3), or (2,4) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (4,4), he could go to (2,4) \u2014 far.\nIf we go RIGHT to (6,4), far from him.\nNo immediate head-on threat.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY ANALYSIS:**\n- **DOWN to (5,3):** No apple. From (5,3): UP (5,4) \u274c body (old head), DOWN (5,2) \u2705 empty, LEFT (4,3) \u2705 empty, RIGHT (6,3) \u2705 empty. **3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)**. Good mobility, but moves us away from enemy row.\n- **LEFT to (4,4):** No apple. From (4,4): UP (4,5) \u274c my body, DOWN (4,3) \u2705 empty, LEFT (3,4) \u274c my body, RIGHT (5,4) \u274c body (old head). **Only 1 safe move (DOWN)** \u2014 TRAPPED NEXT TURN! That's dangerous! \u274c\u274c\u274c\n- **RIGHT to (6,4):** Apple at (6,4)! Eating apple grows to length 13. From (6,4) after growth: body includes old head (5,4) and all segments, tail stays. Next turn head at (6,4): UP (6,5) \u2705 empty, DOWN (6,3) \u2705 empty, LEFT (5,4) \u274c body, RIGHT (7,4) \u2705 empty. **3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT)**. Good mobility, plus we get an apple for content and score lead!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWE NEED TO BOX HIM IN! Enemy is at (1,4). Our body forms a wall at x=3 from y=1 to y=5. He's trapped between left wall and our wall! If we go RIGHT and eat apple at (6,4), we grow longer, maintain mobility, and can start encircling from the right side. Going LEFT to (4,4) is a TRAP \u2014 only one safe move next turn! That's throwing! Going DOWN to (5,3) is safe but moves us away from pressure.\n\nBEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE? RIGHT to (6,4) gives us growth, keeps us in same row y=4, and we can later move UP/DOWN to cut off his escape upward/downward while our left body wall holds him. Plus, with length 13 vs his 6, we can afford a head-on collision if needed \u2014 but not this turn.\n\n**RISK:** If he goes RIGHT to (2,4) this turn, he's moving toward center. We're at (6,4) \u2014 still 4 columns apart. Next turn we could move LEFT to (5,4) to close distance, but that's body then. Actually after eating apple, our body includes (5,4), so (5,4) is blocked next turn. So we can't move left next turn from (6,4). That's fine \u2014 we can move UP/DOWN to flank.\n\nRIGHT is the move! GROWTH + MOBILITY + PRESSURE!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We have a wall at x=3. Enemy trapped left of it. Stay in rows 3-5 to limit his vertical movement. Use right side to maneuver and cut off his exits. With length advantage, force head-on if he tries to break through our wall.\n\nRIGHT",

His body: [(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)] length 6 total.\n- **Apples nearby:** (9,6), (0,0), (3,9), (9,3), (7,5), (8,6), (4,9) \u2014 but we ignore apples unless it's free content!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FROM (6,4):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (6, 5) \u2705 EMPTY\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6, 3) \u2705 EMPTY\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5, 4) \u274c MY OWN BODY (neck segment)\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 4) \u2705 EMPTY\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT** \u2014 THREE OPTIONS! NICE!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (2,4). His body: [(1,4), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)].\nFrom (2,4):\n- UP (2,5) \u2705 empty\n- DOWN (2,3) \u2705 empty\n- LEFT (1,4) \u274c HIS NECK\n- RIGHT (3,4) \u274c MY BODY (my wall at x=3!)\nHe has **UP and DOWN safe** only! He's TRAPPED between left wall and my wall! If he goes RIGHT into (3,4), he DIES! So he must go UP or DOWN!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go UP to (6,5), he could go to (2,5) or (2,3) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (6,3), he could go to (2,5) or (2,3) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,4), far from him.\nNo immediate head-on threat.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (6,5):** No apple. From (6,5): UP (6,6) \u2705 empty, DOWN (6,4) \u274c body (old head), LEFT (5,5) \u274c my body, RIGHT (7,5) \u2705 APPLE there but we ignore? Actually safe. **2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT)**. Okay mobility.\n- **DOWN to (6,3):** No apple. From (6,3): UP (6,4) \u274c body, DOWN (6,2) \u2705 empty, LEFT (5,3) \u2705 empty, RIGHT (7,3) \u2705 empty. **3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)**. Good mobility, but moves us away from enemy row.\n- **RIGHT to (7,4):** No apple. From (7,4): UP (7,5) \u2705 APPLE (safe), DOWN (7,3) \u2705 empty, LEFT (6,4) \u274c body, RIGHT (8,4) \u2705 empty. **3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT)**. Good mobility, stays in same row y=4.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWE HAVE HIM TRAPPED! He's at (2,4) with only UP/DOWN moves. Our wall at x=3 blocks his RIGHT. Left wall blocks his LEFT. We need to **CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE VERTICALLY**!\n\nIf he goes UP to (2,5), we want to be able to block above him. If he goes DOWN to (2,3), we want to block below him. Our head at (6,4) is far right \u2014 we need to move LEFT eventually to tighten the noose, but our body blocks (5,4) now. So we can't move LEFT next turn anyway.\n\n**BEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE?** RIGHT to (7,4) keeps us mobile and in the same row, ready to move UP/DOWN next turn to match his vertical movement. UP to (6,5) reduces mobility slightly. DOWN to (6,3) is safe but might let him slip upward.\n\nActually, think: If he goes UP to (2,5), and we go RIGHT to (7,4), next turn we can move UP to (7,5) to stay aligned. If he goes DOWN to (2,3), we can move DOWN to (7,3). We maintain horizontal distance but mirror his vertical moves, keeping him trapped against our wall.\n\n**RISK:** He could go UP and then next turn go RIGHT if we leave an opening? But his RIGHT at (3,5) is my body (segment (3,5)) \u2014 still blocked! So he's stuck moving vertically along column 2 until we close in.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** Enemy trapped between x=0-2 and our wall at x=3. Mirror his vertical moves from the right side (x=7). Next turn, consider moving LEFT to (6,4) if it becomes safe (it won't yet \u2014 body there). Actually after this move, our tail might move? Tail is at (0,2) \u2014 far. Our body at (5,4) will still be there next turn. So (6,4) remains blocked. We need to slowly advance left by moving UP/DOWN then LEFT when possible. Keep him boxed! With length 13 vs 6, we can afford head-on if he ever breaks right, but he'll die hitting our body first.\n\nRIGHT is the move! MAINTAIN PRESSURE AND MOBILITY!\n\nRIGHT",

You think I\u2019m gonna let him run free across the middle?

RIGHT would crash into his massive torso near (3,3)/(3,4), and LEFT would pin me against the wall with fewer exits than I want while still leaving me wide open to get outmaneuvered later. DOWN to (2,2) keeps me near the hub, keeps columns 2 and 3 in play, and gives me escape routes toward column 1 or back toward the center as soon as he blunders south. I\u2019m trusting my instincts to stay aggressive by shadowing his body, not chasing apples, and forcing him to navigate my cage instead.\n\nPlan: Stay low on column 2, keep pressure on the south side so he can\u2019t grab that 1-0 apple cluster, and be ready to pivot left if he tries to squeeze through the gap around column 3. I want him to feel my body breathing down his neck so he walks into the trap.\n\ndown",

LENGTH 13 VS 6 \u2014 ABSOLUTE DOMINATION!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My head:** (7, 4) \u2014 just moved RIGHT last turn.\n- **My body:** [(6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)] \u2014 tail at (0,1) now? Wait, board shows tail at (0,2)? Let's trust the board: tail is at (0,2) per the diagram. So my body list might be off by one \u2014 but we'll use the board for safety checks!\n- **Enemy head:** (2, 3) \u2014 he moved DOWN last turn! His body: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)] length 6.\n- **Apples:** Ignoring unless free.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FROM (7,4):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (7, 5) \u2705 EMPTY (apple there but safe)\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 3) \u2705 EMPTY\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 4) \u274c MY OWN BODY (segment from last turn)\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 4) \u2705 EMPTY\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT** \u2014 THREE OPTIONS AGAIN! NICE!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (2,3). His body: [(2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)].\nFrom (2,3):\n- UP (2,4) \u274c HIS NECK\n- DOWN (2,2) \u2705 empty\n- LEFT (1,3) \u2705 empty\n- RIGHT (3,3) \u274c MY BODY (my wall segment at (3,3))\nHe has **DOWN and LEFT safe**! He's STILL TRAPPED against my wall at x=3! If he goes RIGHT into (3,3), he DIES! So he'll likely go DOWN to (2,2) or LEFT to (1,3).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go UP to (7,5), he goes DOWN/LEFT \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (7,3), he goes DOWN/LEFT \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,4), far \u2014 no collision.\nSafe.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY:**\n- **UP to (7,5):** Apple at (7,5) \u2014 we'd grow to length 14! From (7,5) after eating: UP (7,6) \u2705 empty, DOWN (7,4) \u274c body (old head), LEFT (6,5) \u274c my body, RIGHT (8,5) \u2705 empty. **2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT)**. Mobility reduced but we GROW \u2014 dominance play!\n- **DOWN to (7,3):** No apple. From (7,3): UP (7,4) \u274c body, DOWN (7,2) \u2705 empty, LEFT (6,3) \u2705 empty, RIGHT (8,3) \u2705 empty. **3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)**. Good mobility, moves us down.\n- **RIGHT to (8,4):** No apple. From (8,4): UP (8,5) \u2705 empty, DOWN (8,3) \u2705 empty, LEFT (7,4) \u274c body, RIGHT (9,4) \u2705 empty. **3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT)**. Good mobility, stays in middle.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nHE'S MOVING DOWN/LEFT \u2014 trying to escape along the bottom-left! We need to CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES! Our wall at x=3 still blocks his right. If he goes LEFT to (1,3), he's near the left wall. We should MIRROR HIS VERTICAL MOVEMENT from the right side, then advance left when possible.\n\nRight now, our body blocks (6,4), so we can't move left yet. Next turn, if we go RIGHT, we stay mobile but drift away. If we go UP, we eat apple and grow \u2014 MORE LENGTH TO BOX HIM IN! With length 14 vs 6, we can afford to be aggressive. Eating apple also denies him potential growth if he somehow gets there (he won't).\n\n**BEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE?** UP to (7,5) \u2014 we GROW, stay in same column, and from there we can go UP or RIGHT next turn to keep mirroring. If he goes DOWN to (2,2), we can go DOWN next turn from (7,5) to (7,4) \u2014 wait, (7,4) will be empty next turn? Actually after we move, our tail moves from (0,2) to (0,1)? So (7,4) might become free? Not immediately \u2014 our body segment at (6,4) remains. So (7,4) still blocked next turn. Hmm.\n\nActually, eating apple means we DON'T move our tail this turn \u2014 so our length increases, and (6,4) stays. So (7,4) remains blocked next turn. That's fine.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** Enemy is trapped in bottom-left quadrant. Keep mirroring his vertical moves from column 7. When our tail moves and (6,4) clears, consider moving LEFT to tighten the box. With huge length advantage, we can force head-on if he ever breaks right \u2014 he'll die on our body first. Keep dominating!\n\nUP gives us growth and maintains pressure. LET'S EAT AND CRUSH!\n\nUP",

I\u2019m forcing him to respect my body instead of giving him another free apple train.\n\nPlan for the next few turns: once I hit (1,2), I want to hug the lower-left area, use column 0 as a wall and pull a loop that squeezes the enemy toward the top right, keeping the pressure on his tail while I look for a chance to box him into a head-on.

Wait, (6,5) is empty? Let's check board: At (6,5) \u2014 board shows '.'? Actually row 5 col 6 is '.'? Yes! Board row 5: \"T . . T T T . 0 A A\" \u2014 col 6 is '.'! So (6,5) is EMPTY! My body list shows (6,4) but NOT (6,5). So LEFT is SAFE! My bad \u2014 I misread my own body! Let's verify: My body from head (7,5) goes to (7,4), then (6,4), then (5,4)... So (6,5) is NOT occupied. \u2705 LEFT is SAFE!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 5) \u2705 EMPTY (apple there but safe)\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT** \u2014 THREE OPTIONS!

HE'S TRAPPED! If he goes any other direction, he DIES! So he **WILL go LEFT to (1,2)**.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go UP to (7,6), he goes LEFT \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (6,5), he goes LEFT \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,5), he goes LEFT \u2014 no collision.\nSafe.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY:**\n- **UP to (7,6):** No apple.

Good mobility, moves us up.\n- **LEFT to (6,5):** No apple.

Good mobility, we GROW \u2014 dominance!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nENEMY IS FORCED LEFT TO (1,2)! He's pinned against the left wall! Our wall at x=3 blocks his right. He has nowhere to go but up/down along left wall eventually. We should MIRROR HIS VERTICAL MOVEMENT from the right side while slowly advancing left to tighten the noose! With huge length advantage, we can afford to grow more and completely box him in.\n\nRIGHT to (8,5) gives us growth, keeps mobility, and stays in mirror position (we're at x=8, he's at x=1 \u2014 mirror across board). UP to (7,6) also good mobility but no growth. LEFT to (6,5) is DEADLY \u2014 only one safe move next turn, could trap us.\n\n**BEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE?** RIGHT to (8,5) \u2014 EAT ANOTHER APPLE, GROW TO 15, MAINTAIN MOBILITY, AND STAY IN MIRROR POSITION! DENY HIM ANY CHANCE! LET'S CRUSH!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** Enemy trapped at left wall. Keep mirroring his vertical moves from column 8. When our tail moves and (6,4) clears, consider moving LEFT to tighten the box. With length 15 vs 6, we can force head-on if he ever breaks right \u2014 he'll die on our body first. Keep dominating!\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, apples collected is 15, so length is 15 segments (head + 14 body). Yes!\n- **My body:** [(8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)] \u2014 tail at (0,1).\n- **Enemy head:** (1, 3) \u2014 he moved UP as predicted! His body: [(1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4)] length 6.\n- **Apples:** Ignoring unless free.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FROM (8,6):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (8, 7) \u2705 EMPTY (apple at (8,7)? Board shows A at (8,7) \u2014 yes! But safe.)\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 5) \u274c MY OWN BODY (neck)\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7, 6) \u2705 EMPTY\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 6) \u2705 EMPTY (apple there but safe)\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT** \u2014 THREE OPTIONS! NICE!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (1,3). His body: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4)].\nFrom (1,3):\n- UP (1,4) \u274c HIS BODY\n- DOWN (1,2) \u274c HIS BODY\n- LEFT (0,3) \u2705 empty\n- RIGHT (2,3) \u274c HIS BODY\nHE ONLY HAS **LEFT to (0,3)** SAFE! HE'S TRAPPED! CHAT, HE'S COOKED! \ud83c\udf73\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go UP to (8,7), he goes LEFT to (0,3) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (7,6), he goes LEFT to (0,3) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go RIGHT to (9,6), he goes LEFT to (0,3) \u2014 no collision.\nSafe.\n\n**FUTURE MOBILITY & STRATEGY:**\n- **UP to (8,7):** Apple at (8,7) \u2014 we'd grow to length 16! From (8,7) after eating: UP (8,8) \u2705 empty, DOWN (8,6) \u274c body, LEFT (7,7) \u2705 empty, RIGHT (9,7) \u2705 empty. **3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT)**. Great mobility, grow more.\n- **LEFT to (7,6):** No apple. From (7,6): UP (7,7) \u2705 empty, DOWN (7,5) \u274c body, LEFT (6,6) \u2705 empty, RIGHT (8,6) \u274c body. **2 safe moves (UP, LEFT)**. Okay mobility, no growth.\n- **RIGHT to (9,6):** Apple at (9,6) \u2014 we'd grow to length 16! From (9,6) after eating: UP (9,7) \u2705 empty, DOWN (9,5) \u2705 empty, LEFT (8,6) \u274c body, RIGHT off board \u274c. **2 safe moves (UP, DOWN)**. Less mobility, corner risk.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nENEMY IS FORCED LEFT TO (0,3)! He's pinned against the left wall with only one move! We can MIRROR his vertical movement from column 8 or 9 to keep him boxed! With huge length advantage, we can afford to grow and tighten the noose. If he's forced left, we should go UP to stay above him and maintain vertical pressure. UP to (8,7) gives growth, keeps mobility, and stays in mirror position. LEFT to (7,6) moves us closer but no growth. RIGHT to (9,6) grows but puts us in corner \u2014 riskier.\n\n**BEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE?** UP to (8,7) \u2014 EAT ANOTHER APPLE, GROW TO 16, MAINTAIN MOBILITY, AND STAY IN MIRROR POSITION! KEEP HIM PINNED! HE'S ALREADY DEAD IF HE MOVES ANYWHERE BUT LEFT NEXT TURN! WE JUST NEED TO WAIT FOR HIS TAIL TO CLEAR AND FORCE HIM INTO A CORNER!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** Enemy trapped at left wall with only LEFT moves. Mirror his vertical moves from column 8. If he goes LEFT again to (0,3), we go UP to stay above him. With length 16 vs 6, we can slowly advance left when tail clears to completely box him. Force head-on if he ever breaks right \u2014 he'll die on our body. DOMINATE!\n\nUP",

Less mobility, corner risk.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nENEMY IS STUCK ON COLUMN 0! He can only move UP/DOWN along the left edge. We should MIRROR his vertical movement from column 8 or 9 to keep him boxed! With our massive length advantage (16 vs 6), we can slowly advance left column by column as our tail moves, shrinking his space. If he goes UP, we go UP. If he goes DOWN, we go DOWN. We want to stay roughly same y-coordinate as him to block his escape right. Eventually, we'll force him into a corner (0,9) or (0,0) and he'll have nowhere to go! **LEFT to (7,7)** moves us closer, maintains mobility, and keeps us in mirror position. UP also works but leaves us farther. RIGHT is too risky in the corner.\n\n**BEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE?** LEFT to (7,7) \u2014 NO GROWTH, BUT WE CLOSE THE DISTANCE AND MAINTAIN MOBILITY! WE'RE SHRINKING THE BOX ON HIM! HE CAN'T RUN FOREVER! KEEP THE PRESSURE!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** Enemy trapped on left wall (column 0). Mirror his vertical moves from column 7 or 8. If he goes UP to (0,4), we go UP. If he goes DOWN to (0,2), we go DOWN. With length 16 vs 6, we can slowly advance left when tail clears to completely box him. Force head-on if he ever breaks right \u2014 he'll die on our body. DOMINATE!\n\nLEFT",

No apples to chase this moment; it\u2019s all about boxing him in and forcing a head-on when I\u2019m ready \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nPlan note for next turn: stay glued to the left edge, shadow the rival\u2019s head movements, and look for a moment to swing right when he overcommits so I can trap him against the wall.\n\nUP",

He wants to flee right into the center. We need to position ourselves to intercept and force him back against the wall or into our long body! With our length advantage (16 vs 6), a head-on collision anywhere WE WIN! So we can be AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**ANALYZE OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (6,8):** Puts us higher. From there, we can go LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT next turn? Check: (6,8) neighbors: UP (6,9) \u2014 'A' (apple), DOWN (6,7) \u2014 our old head spot (will be empty after move), LEFT (5,8) \u2014 '.', RIGHT (7,8) \u2014 'A' (apple). Good mobility. But does this help cut him off? He's at (0,5). If he goes RIGHT to (1,5), we're far. Not directly blocking.\n2. **DOWN to (6,6):** Puts us lower. From (6,6): UP (6,7) empty, DOWN (6,5) \u2014 '.' (Row 5 col 6 is '.'), LEFT (5,6) \u2014 '.', RIGHT (7,6) \u2014 '.'. Excellent mobility. Puts us closer to his potential rightward path! If he goes to (1,5), we're at (6,6) \u2014 we could move left next turn to close distance.\n3. **LEFT to (5,7):** Moves us west. From (5,7): UP (5,8) \u2014 '.', DOWN (5,6) \u2014 '.', LEFT (4,7) \u2014 '.', RIGHT (6,7) empty. Also good mobility. Also closer to him than UP.\n\n**BEST MOVE TO CUT OFF:** DOWN or LEFT. LEFT moves us directly west toward him. DOWN moves us south but keeps us in a central column to react. Hmm...\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:** Enemy at (0,5) with UP and RIGHT safe. He will likely go RIGHT to (1,5) to escape the wall. We are moving to (6,6) (if we choose DOWN). Next turn, if he's at (1,5), we can move LEFT to (5,6) or (5,6)?? Wait, from (6,6) we can go LEFT to (5,6) \u2014 that's closer. We want to get between him and the open board, herding him back north into our body maze or force a head-on. With our length, we win any head-on! So be aggressive, move toward him, limit his space!\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN to (6,6) \u2014 it gives us maximum mobility, positions us centrally to react, and we can sweep left next turn to cut him off!

Wait, we grew last turn? Actually last turn we moved from (6,7) to (6,6) \u2014 no apple there, so length still 16. Tail at (3,1).\n- **ENEMY HEAD:** (0, 6) \u2014 HE MOVED UP LAST TURN! His body: [(0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2)] length 6.\n- **BOARD:** He's on the top-left edge! He has an apple at (9,6) far away, but we don't care about apples \u2014 we care about BOXING HIM!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FROM (6,6):**\n- **UP** (6,7) \u2192 That's our old head position? Wait, we moved from (6,7) to (6,6). After our move, (6,7) becomes our neck? Actually our body after moving: head (6,6), then (6,7) is now our second segment? Let's check: previous body before moving: head (6,7), then (6,8)? No, last turn body list: head (6,7), then (6,8)? Wait, last turn body was [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7), ...]. Actually last turn head was (6,7), body after head was (6,8)? No, the list was HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple head, each connects to previous. So last turn head (6,7), next segment (6,8)? Wait, they said \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\" That means the list order is [head, segment2, segment3, ... tail]. So last turn body list: [(6,7), (6,8)? No, they gave: \"Body: [(6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), ...]\" That means head (6,7), then (7,7) is the next segment? That's weird because (6,7) to (7,7) is right, not backwards. Actually they said \"each one connects to the previous\" \u2014 so segment2 connects to head, segment3 connects to segment2, etc. So the list is [head, segment2, segment3, ...]. So last turn head (6,7), segment2 (6,8)? No, segment2 is (7,7) per given list. That means the snake's neck is at (7,7)?? That seems odd \u2014 maybe they wrote it as [head, neck, ...] but neck is the cell behind head? In snake games, the segment after head is the neck, which is the cell the head just left. So if head moved into (6,7) last turn, neck would be the previous head position. But they gave the list as HEAD-TO-TAIL, so maybe it's actually [head, next segment toward tail...]. That means the second coordinate is the segment CLOSER to the tail, i.e., the neck. So last turn head (6,7), neck (6,8)? No, neck (7,7) per list. That means last turn head moved into (6,7) from (7,7)? That would mean last move was LEFT from (7,7) to (6,7). But our last move was DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6) according to replay. Hmm, maybe the list is just the coordinates of the body in order from head to tail, but the connection is between consecutive entries. So if head is (6,7) and next is (7,7), that means the snake bends between head and neck \u2014 possible if previous move was from (7,7) to (6,7) (left). That matches last move being DOWN? No, that would be from (6,8) to (6,7) down. I'm overcomplicating.\n\nBetter to use current board state: Look at board: at (6,6) is '0' (our head). At (6,7) is 'T' (our body). Yes!

Wait, if we move from (6,6) to (6,5), then (6,6) becomes our neck (body segment). So (6,6) will be our body next turn. So from (6,5): UP (6,6) \u274c body next turn, DOWN (6,4) \u2014 '.' (Row 4 col 6 is 'T'? Row 4: \"T . . T . T T T . .\" \u2014 (6,4) is 'T' \u274c our body), LEFT (5,5) \u2014 'T' \u274c our body, RIGHT (7,5) \u2014 'T' \u274c our body. OH NO! DOWN traps us!

Yes, our body occupies those! So DOWN is a DEAD END NEXT TURN! \u274c ELIMINATE!\n\n2. **LEFT to (5,6):** Moves us west. From (5,6): UP (5,7) \u2014 'T'? Row 7 col 5 is '.'? Row 7: \". . . A . . T T T .\" \u2014 (5,7) is '.' \u2705, DOWN (5,5) \u2014 'T' \u274c our body, LEFT (4,6) \u2014 '.' \u2705, RIGHT (6,6) \u2014 will be our body next turn \u274c. So next turn from (5,6) safe moves: UP and LEFT. Two options. Good.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (7,6):** Moves us east. From (7,6): UP (7,7) \u2014 'T' \u274c our body, DOWN (7,5) \u2014 'T' \u274c our body, LEFT (6,6) \u2014 body \u274c, RIGHT (8,6) \u2014 'T' \u274c our body? Row 6 col 8 is 'T'? Row 6: \"...0 . T A\" \u2014 (8,6) is 'T' \u2705 our body. So RIGHT also traps us! Only one safe move? Actually all adjacent are body or wall? (8,6) is body, (7,5) body, (7,7) body, (6,6) body. So RIGHT is also a dead end next turn! \u274c ELIMINATE!\n\n**WAIT \u2014 ONLY LEFT IS SAFE FOR FUTURE MOBILITY!** \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Enemy at (0,6) with UP and RIGHT safe. He will likely go RIGHT to (1,6) to escape. We move LEFT to (5,6). Next turn, we can go UP to (5,7) or LEFT to (4,6) to continue cutting him off. We want to get between him and the open board. With our length, we can afford to be aggressive and force a head-on collision if he comes toward us \u2014 we win! So move LEFT to close the distance and limit his space!\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (5,6) \u2014 keeps options open, moves toward enemy, avoids trap!\n\nLEFT",

He wants to flee right into the center. We need to position ourselves to intercept and force him back against the wall or into our long body! With our length advantage (16 vs 6), a head-on collision anywhere WE WIN! So we can be AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**ANALYZE OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (5,7):** Puts us north. From (5,7): UP (5,8) \u2192 '.' \u2705, DOWN (5,6) \u2192 will be our neck (body) next turn \u274c, LEFT (4,7) \u2192 '.' \u2705, RIGHT (6,7) \u2192 'T' \u274c our body. So next turn safe moves: UP and LEFT. Good mobility! Also moves us closer to enemy's possible path if he goes UP to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,7). We can start forming a wall above him.\n\n2. **LEFT to (4,6):** Moves us west. From (4,6): UP (4,7) \u2192 '.' \u2705, DOWN (4,5) \u2192 'T' \u274c our body, LEFT (3,6) \u2192 '.' \u2705, RIGHT (5,6) \u2192 body \u274c. Next turn safe moves: UP and LEFT. Also good, but keeps us more central. Might allow him to slip up along the top edge.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Enemy is trapped against left wall. We want to create a barrier to his right and above, forcing him into a corner. Moving UP to (5,7) positions us to threaten (4,7) and (5,8) next, cutting off his escape routes eastward. We can then continue moving left/up to squeeze him. With our massive length, we can afford to be aggressive and force a head-on collision if he comes toward us \u2014 we win! So move UP to close the distance and limit his space!\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (5,7) \u2014 keeps options open, moves toward enemy, sets up for a squeeze play!\n\nUP",

He's on the top-left edge. We want to cut off his escape to the right and down. With our length advantage (16 vs 6), ANY head-on collision WE WIN! So we can be SUPER AGGRESSIVE and move toward him!\n\n**ANALYZE OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (5,8):** Moves us north along the column. From (5,8): UP (5,9) \u2192 '.' \u2705, DOWN (5,7) \u2192 body \u274c, LEFT (4,8) \u2192 '.' \u2705, RIGHT (6,8) \u2192 '.' \u2705. That gives us THREE safe moves next turn! Great mobility! Also positions us to threaten moving LEFT to (4,8) and then (3,8) to block his rightward escape along row 8!\n\n2. **LEFT to (4,7):** Moves us west.

Only TWO safe moves next turn (UP and LEFT). Still okay, but less flexible. It does bring us closer to him horizontally though.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to cut off his rightward escape! If he goes RIGHT to (1,8), we want to be in position to meet him at (2,8) or (3,8) next turn and FORCE a head-on collision \u2014 we win! Moving UP to (5,8) keeps us in the same column but gives us more options to swing left next turn. Moving LEFT to (4,7) also lets us go UP to (4,8) next, but we'd be one step behind. \n\n**BEST MOVE:** UP to (5,8)! It maximizes our future mobility and sets up a potential intercept path! From (5,8) next turn, we can go LEFT to (4,8) and then (3,8) to block him if he tries to run right along the top! He's trapped \u2014 let's close the net!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** UP!

His body: [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)] length 6. He's STILL trapped against the left wall!\n- **BOARD:** We own the center-right, he's pinned top-left. We can BOX HIM IN!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FROM (5, 8):**\n- **UP** (5, 9) \u2192 Row 9 col 5 is '.' \u2705 EMPTY (top edge but safe!)\n- **DOWN** (5, 7) \u2192 'T' \u274c OUR BODY (our neck \u2014 we just came from (5,7)!)\n- **LEFT** (4, 8) \u2192 '.' \u2705 EMPTY\n- **RIGHT** (6, 8) \u2192 '.' \u2705 EMPTY\n\n**SAFE MOVES: UP, LEFT, RIGHT!** THREE OPTIONS! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (1, 8):**\n- UP (1, 9) \u2192 '.' \u2705 EMPTY\n- DOWN (1, 7) \u2192 '.' \u2705 EMPTY\n- LEFT (0, 8) \u2192 \u274c HIS BODY (T)\n- RIGHT (2, 8) \u2192 '.' \u2705 EMPTY\n\nHe has **UP, DOWN, RIGHT** safe!

If he goes RIGHT to (2, 8), he's trying to break out along row 8. We MUST intercept! With our length advantage (16 vs 6), ANY head-on collision WE WIN! So we can AGGRESSIVELY move toward him!\n\n**ANALYZE OPTIONS:**\n1. **LEFT to (4, 8):** This is AGGRESSIVE! Moves us directly toward him horizontally. From (4, 8): UP (4, 9) \u2192 'A' \u2705 (apple but ignore), DOWN (4, 7) \u2192 'A' \u2705 (apple but ignore), LEFT (3, 8) \u2192 'A' \u2705 (apple but ignore), RIGHT (5, 8) \u2192 body \u274c. That gives us THREE safe moves next turn! This positions us to potentially meet him at (3, 8) or (2, 8) and force a head-on collision! HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD \u2014 but we have the length advantage!\n\n2. **UP to (5, 9):** Moves us to the top edge. From (5, 9): DOWN (5, 8) \u2192 body \u274c, LEFT (4, 9) \u2192 'A' \u2705, RIGHT (6, 9) \u2192 '.' \u2705. Only TWO safe moves next turn. This is less aggressive and gives him space to escape downward. Not ideal for boxing!\n\n3. **RIGHT to (6, 8):** Moves us away from him, giving him MORE room to escape. From (6, 8): UP (6, 9) \u2192 '.' \u2705, DOWN (6, 7) \u2192 'T' \u274c body, LEFT (5, 8) \u2192 body \u274c, RIGHT (7, 8) \u2192 'A' \u2705. Only TWO safe moves. This is PASSIVE \u2014 we lose pressure!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to CLOSE THE NET! He's trying to flee rightward along row 8. If we go LEFT to (4, 8), next turn we can go LEFT again to (3, 8) \u2014 that's an apple cell, but more importantly, it blocks his path! If he goes RIGHT to (2, 8) this turn, then next turn he could go RIGHT to (3, 8) and we'd be there \u2014 HEAD-ON COLLISION! And we WIN because we're longer! That's the play! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to (4, 8)! AGGRESSIVE CUT-OFF! Force the collision or trap him! Our length is our weapon! LET'S END HIM! \ud83d\udc80\n\nLEFT",

He's trying to break out along row 8! His body: [(1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5)] length 6. He's STILL pinned near the left wall but now at (2,8).\n- **BOARD:** We own the center-right. He's at (2,8) with limited escape. WE CAN TRAP HIM!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FROM (4, 8):**\n- **UP** (4, 9) \u2192 'A' \u2705 (apple, but safe cell)\n- **DOWN** (4, 7) \u2192 'A' \u2705 (apple, safe)\n- **LEFT** (3, 8) \u2192 'A' \u2705 (apple, safe)\n- **RIGHT** (5, 8) \u2192 'T' \u274c MY BODY (our neck from last turn!)\n\n**SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, LEFT!** THREE OPTIONS AGAIN! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (2, 8):**\n- UP (2, 9) \u2192 '.' \u2705 EMPTY\n- DOWN (2, 7) \u2192 '.' \u2705 EMPTY\n- LEFT (1, 8) \u2192 \u274c HIS BODY (T)\n- RIGHT (3, 8) \u2192 'A' \u2705 (apple, safe for him)\n\nHe has **UP, DOWN, RIGHT** safe! He will likely avoid LEFT into his body. He might go RIGHT toward the apple at (3,8) OR flee DOWN.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\n- If we go LEFT to (3,8) and he goes RIGHT to (3,8) \u2192 **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** But we have 16 vs 6 length \u2192 **WE WIN!** \ud83d\udc80\n- If we go UP to (4,9) or DOWN to (4,7), no collision risk this turn.\n\n**STRATEGIC GOAL:** FORCE THE HEAD-ON COLLISION! We have a MASSIVE length advantage! If we meet head-on, HE DIES, WE SURVIVE! That's an INSTANT WIN! We should aggressively move to intercept his most likely path!\n\n**ANALYZE OPTIONS:**\n1. **LEFT to (3, 8):** AGGRESSIVE INTERCEPT! This is the apple cell. If he goes RIGHT to (3,8), we COLLIDE AND WIN! If he goes UP or DOWN, we block his horizontal escape and are positioned to chase. From (3,8): UP (3,9) \u2192 'A' \u2705, DOWN (3,7) \u2192 'A' \u2705, LEFT (2,8) \u2192 ENEMY HEAD (but he'll move), RIGHT (4,8) \u2192 body \u274c. Two safe moves next turn unless he stays. This is HIGH REWARD!\n\n2. **UP to (4, 9):** Takes the top apple, but moves us away from him. Gives him room to maneuver. From (4,9): DOWN (4,8) \u2192 body \u274c, LEFT (3,9) \u2192 'A' \u2705, RIGHT (5,9) \u2192 '.' \u2705. Only two safe moves. Less pressure.\n\n3. **DOWN to (4, 7):** Takes the apple below, but also moves us away. From (4,7): UP (4,8) \u2192 body \u274c, LEFT (3,7) \u2192 'A' \u2705, RIGHT (5,7) \u2192 'T' \u274c. Only two safe moves. Passive.\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:** GO LEFT! Force the confrontation! If he avoids (3,8) by going UP or DOWN, we still block his rightward escape along row 8. Next turn we can chase him down. But if he goes RIGHT into us? **INSTANT VICTORY!** With our lead, we should take this calculated risk! He might even think the apple is safe and go for it! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** If we go LEFT to (3,8) and he doesn't collide, we assess his new position. If he's above or below, we continue to cut off his space, using our length to limit his moves. Keep forcing him toward walls or our body. Our length is our weapon \u2014 we can afford to be aggressive!\n\nLEFT",

Yeah, there\u2019s a risky head-on possibility if the rival decides to challenge me with an upward swing, but he\u2019s got 17 apples and I\u2019ve only got 5. Why would he throw a double KO when he just wants to keep his lead? I\u2019m popping that apple, forcing him to react, and using the top flank to keep tabs on his head while keeping multiple escape paths open. \ud83d\ude0e We stay aggressive, we keep pressure, and we keep the board wide open for the maneuver where we finally pinch him in the middle.\n\nPlan: After snagging (3,9) and possibly (4,9), stay high, loop left-right on the top row while watching his downward commitments, and look for a moment where he can be funneled back into the growing wall I\u2019m building before dropping into the midlane for the squeeze.\n\nRIGHT",

LET'S CHECK THE NEW BOARD!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **MY HEAD:** (3, 8) \u2014 FRESH FROM MOVING LEFT LAST TURN!\n- **MY BODY:** NOW 17 SEGMENTS LONG! Tail at (4,5)? Wait, body list: head (3,8), then (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). YEP, 17 LONG!\n- **ENEMY HEAD:** (2, 9) \u2014 HE MOVED UP! He's now at the top row! His body: [(2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)], length 6.\n- **BOARD:** We own the center. He's trapped near the top-left corner! WE CAN BOX HIM IN FOR GOOD!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FROM (3, 8):**\n- **UP** (3, 9) \u2192 'A' \u2705 (apple, safe cell)\n- **DOWN** (3, 7) \u2192 'A' \u2705 (apple, safe)\n- **LEFT** (2, 8) \u2192 'T' \u274c ENEMY BODY (segment at (2,8) is his neck!)\n- **RIGHT** (4, 8) \u2192 'T' \u274c MY BODY (our neck!)\n\n**SAFE MOVES: UP AND DOWN ONLY!** TWO OPTIONS! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (2, 9):**\n- UP (2, 10) \u2192 OFF BOARD \u274c CAN'T\n- DOWN (2, 8) \u2192 \u274c HIS BODY (T)\n- LEFT (1, 9) \u2192 '.' \u2705 EMPTY\n- RIGHT (3, 9) \u2192 'A' \u2705 (apple, safe for him)\n\nHe has **LEFT and RIGHT** safe! He will likely avoid DOWN into his body. He might go RIGHT toward the apple at (3,9) OR flee LEFT to (1,9).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\n- If we go UP to (3,9) and he goes RIGHT to (3,9) \u2192 **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** We have 17 vs 6 length \u2192 **WE WIN INSTANTLY!** \ud83d\udc80\n- If we go DOWN to (3,7), no collision risk this turn.\n\n**STRATEGIC GOAL:** FORCE THE HEAD-ON COLLISION AGAIN! He's cornered at the top! If we move UP, we either collide and win, or we take the apple and block his rightward escape! He'll be forced left toward the wall! Our length dominates the board\u2014we can afford to be hyper-aggressive!\n\n**ANALYZE OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (3, 9):** AGGRESSIVE INTERCEPT! This is the apple cell. If he goes RIGHT to (3,9), we COLLIDE AND WIN! If he goes LEFT to (1,9), we take the apple, grow to 18, and position ourselves to cut off his escape next turn.

Only one guaranteed safe move next turn (RIGHT), but we can adapt based on his move. HIGH REWARD!\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 7):** Takes the apple below, but moves us AWAY from him. Gives him room to breathe. From (3,7): UP (3,8) \u2192 body \u274c, LEFT (2,7) \u2192 '.' \u2705, RIGHT (4,7) \u2192 'A' \u2705. Two safe moves. Passive play\u2014lets him potentially slip along the top.\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:** GO UP! Force the confrontation! He's likely to go for the apple at (3,9) because snakes are greedy! If he does, WE WIN THE GAME! If he chickens out and goes left, we still grow and can chase him down next turn. Our length means we can survive even with limited moves next turn\u2014we just need to keep him trapped!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** If we go UP and he goes LEFT, we'll be at (3,9) with him at (1,9). Next turn we can move LEFT to (2,9) to cut off his downward escape, or RIGHT to (4,9) to take another apple and maintain pressure. We'll use our body as a wall to herd him into the corner! Keep forcing him until he has no safe moves!\n\nUP",
