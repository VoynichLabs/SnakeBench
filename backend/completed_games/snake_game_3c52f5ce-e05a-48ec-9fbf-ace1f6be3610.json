Let me analyze step by step:\n\n**Current Position Analysis:**\n- My head: (8,8), enemy snake: (6,5)\n- Apples: (4,7), (6,6), (7,2), (8,4), (0,9)\n- Single snake segment, so very mobile\n\n**Direction Viability Check:**\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8): Valid position, free cell in the corner - SAFE\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,8): Open space, leads toward central areas - SAFE  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,7): Leads toward apple at (8,4) - SAFE\n- UP \u2192 (8,9): Edge of board would limit options - SAFE but restrictive\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- I can't reach the closest apple (8,4) in one step - need to move toward it\n- My immediate goals should be: (1) move toward reachable apples, (2) maintain safe distance from enemy snake, (3) keep options open\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,5). They'll likely move toward the apple at (6,6) or other nearby food. This gives me some breathing room in the bottom-right area.\n\nLEFT and DOWN both look promising as they move away from the board edge and give me access to more of the board. LEFT (7,8) opens paths toward the central apples, while DOWN (8,7) keeps me on track for that downward path to (8,4).\n\nActually, looking more carefully, going DOWN to (8,7) brings me one step closer to apple (8,4), is safe, and leaves me with strong future options (LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN).\n\nDOWN",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6, 4) \u2192 empty, inside board, no body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 empty, inside board. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 5) \u2192 empty, inside board. Safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and head-on collision risk:**  \n\nEnemy head at (8, 8). Possible moves for enemy: UP (8, 9), DOWN (8, 7), LEFT (7, 8), RIGHT (9, 8).  \n\nMy possible moves:  \n- If I go UP to (6, 6), enemy could go DOWN to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 8) \u2014 no chance of head-on collision with me.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (7, 5), enemy could go DOWN to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 8) \u2014 wait, if enemy goes LEFT to (7, 8), that\u2019s far from me. Actually, enemy at (8, 8) going LEFT is (7, 8), I\u2019d be at (7, 5) \u2014 not same cell.  \n- If I go LEFT to (5, 5) or DOWN to (6, 4), even less likely to collide.  \n\nSo no head-on collision possible this turn regardless.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nClosest apple: (6, 6) is 1 step away (UP). Eating it now grows me to length 2 (head + 1 body segment).  \n\nIf I eat apple at (6, 6), next turn my body will be at (6, 5), head at (6, 6). That\u2019s fine.  \n\nOther apples: (4, 7) is 3 steps away, (8, 4) is 3 steps away, (7, 2) is 4 steps away, (0, 9) is far.  \n\nGoing UP to (6, 6) gets apple immediately, gives me +1 length, +1 score.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move:**  \n\nIf I go UP to (6, 6):  \nNext turn, my body at (6, 5), head at (6, 6). Possible moves from (6, 6): UP (6, 7), DOWN (6, 5) blocked by body, LEFT (5, 6), RIGHT (7, 6). So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf I go elsewhere (e.g., DOWN to (6, 4)):  \nNo apple, still length 1, more flexibility next turn but slower score gain.  \n\nGiven the goal is to collect apples and grow while staying safe, eating the closest apple now is good.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \n\nAfter eating apple at (6, 6), avoid moving DOWN into body next turn. Consider moving toward (4, 7) or (8, 4) depending on enemy position. Keep distance from enemy head to avoid future head-on collisions.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \n\nUP",

If I go RIGHT, I approach enemy head, which is risky for future head-on collisions. Better to avoid moving toward enemy early.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move:**  \n\nIf I go UP to (6, 7):  \nNext turn, body at (6, 6), head at (6, 7).

Possible moves: UP (5, 7), DOWN (5, 5), LEFT (4, 6), RIGHT (6, 6) blocked by body. So 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 6):  \nNext turn, body at (6, 6), head at (7, 6). Possible moves: UP (7, 7), DOWN (7, 5), LEFT (6, 6) blocked by body, RIGHT (8, 6). So 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll give same immediate safe follow-up count, but RIGHT moves toward enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \n\nAfter this move, aim for apple at (4, 7) or (2, 8) while keeping distance from enemy head at (8, 7). Avoid boxing myself in corners. Since enemy has no body, it\u2019s flexible and could cut me off if I go too central later.

So **RIGHT is unsafe** (possible head-on).  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves from (7, 7):**  \n\nEnemy options:  \nUP (7, 8), DOWN (7, 6), LEFT (6, 7), RIGHT (8, 7).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 7):  \nEnemy could go LEFT to (6, 7) \u2014 that\u2019s my current head, so no collision.  \nEnemy could go DOWN to (7, 6) \u2014 fine.  \nNo possible head-on with me at (5, 7).  \n\nIf I go UP to (6, 8):  \nEnemy could go LEFT to (6, 7) \u2014 that\u2019s my old head, fine.  \nNo possible head-on with me at (6, 8).  \n\nBoth safe from immediate collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nFrom (6, 7):  \nClosest apple: (4, 7) is 2 steps left. (2, 8) is 4 steps away (left 4, up 1). (0, 9) is far. (8, 4) is far.  \n\n- LEFT (5, 7) \u2192 directly toward (4, 7).  \n- UP (6, 8) \u2192 toward (2, 8) and (0, 9) but less direct.  \n\nLEFT seems better for apple gathering.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move:**  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 7):  \nNext turn, body at (6, 7), head at (5, 7). Possible moves: UP (5, 8), DOWN (5, 6), LEFT (4, 7) (apple there), RIGHT (6, 7) blocked by body. So 3 safe moves, one leads to apple.  \n\nIf I go UP to (6, 8):  \nNext turn, body at (6, 7), head at (6, 8). Possible moves: UP (6, 9), DOWN (6, 7) blocked, LEFT (5, 8), RIGHT (7, 8). So 3 safe moves, no immediate apple.  \n\nLEFT gives me a chance to eat (4, 7) next turn, which grows me and gives more space.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement consideration:**  \n\nEnemy at (7, 7) might go for (8, 4) or (4, 7) too. If enemy goes LEFT to (6, 7) this turn, they\u2019d be adjacent to me if I go LEFT to (5, 7), but not colliding. Then next turn they could try to cut me off from (4, 7) by moving to (5, 7) if I\u2019m not there \u2014 but I\u2019d be at (4, 7) if I move LEFT then LEFT again into apple.  \n\nActually, if I go LEFT to (5, 7) now, enemy could go DOWN to (7, 6) or UP to (7, 8) \u2014 not interfering with my path to (4, 7).  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter eating (4, 7) next turn (if possible), consider moving toward (2, 8) or (0, 9) while keeping distance from enemy. Avoid right side where enemy is.  \n\nLEFT seems best: gets apple next turn, safe now, avoids enemy head.  \n\nLEFT",

No head-on risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApple (0,9) is at top-left corner: from (1,8), I can go LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT.  \nApple (1,1) is far but reachable later.  \nApple (5,3) and (6,4) are closer to enemy.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move:**  \nIf UP (1,9): next turn body [(1,8),(2,8),(3,8)], head (1,9). Possible moves: DOWN (1,8) blocked by body, LEFT (0,9) \u2013 apple there, RIGHT (2,9), UP (1,10) out of bounds \u2192 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). Going UP now sets up eating (0,9) next turn if LEFT is safe then.  \n\nIf DOWN (1,7): next turn body [(1,8),(2,8),(3,8)], head (1,7). Possible moves: UP (1,8) blocked, DOWN (1,6), LEFT (0,7), RIGHT (2,7) \u2192 3 safe moves. Moves away from (0,9) but keeps mobility.  \n\nIf LEFT (0,8): next turn body [(1,8),(2,8),(3,8)], head (0,8). Possible moves: UP (0,9) \u2013 apple there, DOWN (0,7), RIGHT (1,8) blocked by body, LEFT (-1,8) out of bounds \u2192 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). Corner reduces options but gets me closer to apple.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gives me two safe moves next turn, one of which (LEFT) goes directly to apple (0,9).  \nLEFT now also gives two safe moves next turn, one of which (UP) goes to apple (0,9).  \nBut UP now leaves me at (1,9) with more space to maneuver after eating the apple next turn (since from (0,9) after eating, I could go DOWN or RIGHT).  \nIf I go LEFT now to (0,8), then next turn UP to (0,9) to eat apple, I\u2019ll be in top-left corner with only DOWN and RIGHT as exits, which is riskier.  \n\nBetter to approach apple from below (1,9) \u2192 (0,9) rather than from left (0,8) \u2192 (0,9).  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nEat (0,9) next turn if safe, then move away from corner to avoid trapping. Keep an eye on enemy heading toward (7,2) or (5,3)/(6,4). Maintain mobility and avoid head-on collisions.  \n\n**Best move:** UP  \n\nUP",

From (0,8) after that, options: UP (0,9) body, DOWN (0,7), RIGHT (1,8) body, LEFT out of bounds \u2192 only DOWN safe again? Wait, check: after moving DOWN to (0,8), body will be [(0,8),(0,9),(1,9),(1,8),(2,8)]? Let\u2019s simulate:  \nTurn now: head (1,9) \u2192 LEFT to (0,9) eat apple \u2192 body: [(0,9),(1,9),(1,8),(2,8),(3,8)].  \nNext turn: move DOWN to (0,8) \u2192 body: [(0,8),(0,9),(1,9),(1,8),(2,8)]. Then from (0,8): UP (0,9) body, DOWN (0,7) empty, LEFT (-1,8) out, RIGHT (1,8) body \u2192 only DOWN safe. That\u2019s two turns in a row with only 1 safe move \u2014 very dangerous.  \n\nRIGHT (2,9) \u2192 only RIGHT next turn to (3,9). From (3,9): body will be [(3,9),(2,9),(1,9),(1,8)], length 4. Then moves: DOWN (3,8) \u2013 empty? (3,8) is currently my tail at turn 9? Wait, current body: (1,8),(2,8),(3,8). After moving RIGHT to (2,9), new body: [(2,9),(1,9),(1,8),(2,8)] \u2014 so (3,8) is free. From (3,9) next turn: DOWN (3,8) empty, LEFT (2,9) body, RIGHT (4,9) empty, UP out \u2192 two safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). That\u2019s better than the LEFT path.  \n\nSo RIGHT gives me a chance to regain mobility after one turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nAvoid corner trap. Eat (0,9) only if I can approach from below later. For now, go RIGHT to (2,9), then next turn likely RIGHT again to (3,9), then DOWN toward center.

Let\u2019s check:  \nFrom (2,7): UP to (2,8) \u2192 LEFT to (1,8) \u2192 UP to (1,9) \u2192 LEFT to (0,9). That\u2019s 3 moves, not 2. So 3 steps.  \n\nEnemy is far at (3,3), so (0,9) is safe to go for.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\nIf UP to (2,8):  \nNext turn from (2,8):  \n- UP (2,9): empty.  \n- DOWN (2,7): my old head (now body) \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT (1,8): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,8): my body \u2192 death.  \nSo only UP and LEFT safe next turn.

Good.  \n\nIf LEFT to (1,7):  \nNext turn from (1,7):  \n- UP (1,8): empty.  \n- DOWN (1,6): empty.  \n- LEFT (0,7): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2,7): my old head (now body) \u2192 death.  \nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT safe \u2014 3 options. Good.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI want to avoid trapping myself. UP gives fewer options next turn.  \nDOWN or LEFT keep flexibility.  \n\nApple (0,9) is reachable via UP then LEFT then UP, but UP now reduces options. Maybe go LEFT first to (1,7), then next turn go UP to (1,8) toward (0,9). That keeps more options open.  \n\nEnemy is at (3,3), heading possibly toward (1,1) or (6,0) or (7,2). If I go DOWN toward (1,1), I might meet enemy later.  \n\nGiven my body blocks top-right area, maybe best to circle toward (0,9) via left side.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT to (1,7) keeps options open, moves toward left side apples (0,9) or (1,1) later, and avoids enemy\u2019s immediate area.  \n\nDOWN is also safe but moves me toward enemy\u2019s possible path to (1,1).  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better for long-term flexibility and apple access.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (1,7), consider going UP to (1,8) to approach (0,9), or DOWN to (1,6) to approach (1,1), depending on enemy position. Keep options open, avoid trapping near my body at top.  \n\nLEFT",

UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (1,3):**  \nEnemy\u2019s possible heads next turn:  \n- UP (1,4): empty.  \n- DOWN (1,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (0,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2,3): its own body \u2192 death.  \n\nSo enemy will avoid RIGHT.  \n\nMy safe moves: UP (1,9), LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8).  \nNo overlap with enemy\u2019s possible heads (1,4), (1,2), (0,3). No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples by Manhattan distance from (1,8):  \n- (0,9): distance |1-0| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2  \n- (1,1): distance 0 + 7 = 7  \n- (7,2): distance 6 + 6 = 12  \n- (6,0): distance 5 + 8 = 13  \n- (9,1): distance 8 + 7 = 15  \n\n(0,9) is very close (2 moves away).  \nFrom (1,8), UP to (1,9) then LEFT to (0,9) gets it.  \nEnemy is far away at (1,3), so unlikely to reach it first.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\n**If UP to (1,9):**  \nNext turn from (1,9):  \n- UP off board \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN (1,8): my old head (now body) \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT (0,9): apple, safe if not occupied by enemy head.  \n- RIGHT (2,9): empty.  \nSo only LEFT and RIGHT safe (2 options), but LEFT leads to apple. Risk: being on top edge reduces options.\n\n**If LEFT to (0,8):**  \nNext turn from (0,8):  \n- UP (0,9): apple, safe if no enemy there.  \n- DOWN (0,7): empty.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT (1,8): my old head (now body) \u2192 death.  \nSo only UP and DOWN safe (2 options).  \n\n**If RIGHT to (2,8):**  \nNext turn from (2,8):  \n- UP (2,9): empty.  \n- DOWN (2,7): my body \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT (1,8): my old head (now body) \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT (3,8): empty.  \nSo only UP and RIGHT safe (2 options).  \n\nAll three moves give only 2 safe moves next turn, but UP to (1,9) puts me one step from apple (0,9) and I can eat it next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t interfere.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy path to (0,9):**  \nEnemy at (1,3) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 (1,8) \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 (0,9) takes 7 moves.  \nI can get there in 2 moves.

Possible enemy heads next turn: (1,1), (0,2), (2,2).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (0,9), enemy\u2019s possible heads are (1,1), (0,2), (2,2) \u2192 no conflict.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2,9), also no conflict.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (1,9):  \n- Apple at (0,9) is 1 step away (LEFT).  \n- Apple at (1,1) is 8 steps away.  \n- Others are farther.  \n\nLEFT gets me the apple immediately, growing to length 5.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\n**LEFT to (0,9) and eat apple:**  \nNext turn head at (0,9), body: [(1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (2,7)] + new tail segment (old tail stays at (2,7) until move). Actually, after eating, growth happens: new head at (0,9), body extends by 1 cell at tail end after movement, so next turn my body will be [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (2,7)], length 5.  \n\nFrom (0,9) next turn:  \n- UP: off board \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN: (0,8) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT: off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT: (1,9) \u2192 my body \u2192 death.  \n\nSo only DOWN is safe next turn if I go LEFT now. That\u2019s risky \u2014 only 1 safe move next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**RIGHT to (2,9):**  \nFrom (2,9) next turn:  \n- UP: off board \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN: (2,8) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT: (1,9) \u2192 my body \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT: (3,9) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn (2 options).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nLEFT gives apple now but traps me next turn with only DOWN (0,8) as safe move. From (0,8) the turn after, options open up again, but being forced into one move is dangerous if enemy can cut me off.  \n\nRIGHT gives no apple now, but keeps 2 safe moves next turn and avoids immediate dead-end.  \n\nEnemy is far away at (1,2), but if I go LEFT and eat apple, enemy could move toward (0,2) or (1,1) and possibly block my DOWN escape from (0,9) next turn? Actually, from (0,9) only DOWN to (0,8) is safe for me; enemy at (0,2) or (1,1) can\u2019t reach (0,8) in 1 turn, so I\u2019d survive next turn. But the turn after that from (0,8), I\u2019d have more options.  \n\nStill, being forced into exactly one move next turn is risky if something unexpected happens (like enemy moving into my only safe cell).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nIf I take apple at (0,9), I tie enemy at 4 apples each, but my length becomes 5 vs enemy\u2019s 5. After that, I must go DOWN to (0,8), then likely move toward (1,1) apple or others.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,9), I keep flexibility, maybe aim for (9,1) or (7,2) later, but enemy might get (0,9) apple next turn (they\u2019re far, though: from (1,2) to (0,9) is 7 moves). Actually, they can\u2019t get it next turn anyway.  \n\nGiven enemy is far, taking apple now is safe in terms of head-on collision. The forced move next turn is acceptable because enemy can\u2019t reach (0,8) in 1 turn from their possible positions.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT to eat apple, grow, then deal with next turn\u2019s single safe move.  \n\nLEFT",

The enemy is trapped in the top-left with only one decent option (the apple at (0, 8) if it exists), so I should efficiently collect from this richer bottom-right area while avoiding any potential head-on collisions if the enemy ventures down.\n\nUP",

However, I need to consider my position relative to the rich apple cluster at the right edge:\n\n- If I go UP \u2192 (7, 3), I can continue toward (8, 6) and approach from above\n- If I go RIGHT \u2192 (8, 2), I'll be positioned to target (9, 0), (9, 1), and potentially (8, 6)\n- If I go DOWN \u2192 (7, 1), I can drop toward (6, 0) and (7, 0)\n\nRIGHT is strategically sound because:\n- It positions me optimally for collecting (9, 0) and (9, 1) in the next 2 turns\n- It keeps me safe distance from the edge while moving toward the densest apple cluster\n- All three directions from (8, 2) will be safe moves next turn\n- Snake #1 remains trapped in the north-west corner and poses no immediate threat\n\n**Long-term strategy:** Continue eastward to secure the (9, 0) and (9, 1) apple cluster, then reassess. Snake #1 is boxed in and unlikely to threaten my lead. I should avoid getting trapped near edges and maintain flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN to (1,7) gives growth, keeps 3 exits, and leaves me near (0,7), (2,7), (1,6) for escape. From there I can monitor enemy\u2019s approach and move away if needed.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN to (1,7) is safe, gives an apple, and maximizes next-turn options.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (1,7), check enemy\u2019s new head position. If enemy moves toward (1,4), consider moving LEFT to (0,7) or DOWN to (1,6) to avoid being blocked. If enemy stays low, maybe go for (0,7) or (2,7) to keep space.

Risky.  \nBetter to avoid being adjacent to enemy\u2019s possible next head.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT to (0,7) avoids adjacency with enemy\u2019s possible moves (enemy at (1,4) can go to (1,5),(0,4),(2,4) \u2014 none adjacent to (0,7)). It gives fewer next-turn options but is safer from immediate enemy threat.

Enemy at (2,6) could go UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6). If enemy goes LEFT to (1,6), then (1,4) remains body (since tail moves forward only if apple eaten). Enemy didn\u2019t eat apple last turn (no apple at (2,6)), so tail stays. So (1,4) will still be enemy body next turn \u2192 unsafe for me. If enemy goes UP to (2,7), (1,4) still enemy body. So (1,4) unsafe.  \nThus from (0,4) next turn, only DOWN is safe.  \n\n**RIGHT to (1,5):**  \nBody: [(1,5),(0,5),(0,6),(0,7),(1,7),(1,8),(2,8),(3,8),(3,7)] (tail at (3,6) gone).  \nFrom (1,5) next turn:  \n- UP (1,6): could be enemy head if enemy moves LEFT to (1,6) this turn.  \n- DOWN (1,4): enemy body \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT (0,5): my body \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT (2,5): enemy body \u2192 death.  \nSo from (1,5) next turn, only UP is safe if enemy not at (1,6). If enemy moves LEFT to (1,6) this turn, then (1,6) is enemy head \u2192 unsafe for me. Then I\u2019d have zero safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApple at (0,1) is 3 steps DOWN from (0,4). Apple at (4,7) is far.  \nEnemy is near top apples (1,9),(2,9) if it goes UP.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT to (1,5) is very risky: if enemy goes LEFT to (1,6), I\u2019m trapped next turn.  \nDOWN to (0,4) guarantees at least one safe move next turn (DOWN again to (0,3)), and moves toward apple (0,1).  \nEven though DOWN leads to a corridor, I can survive longer and maybe enemy will move away toward top apples, giving me space later.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (0,4), go DOWN to (0,3) next turn unless enemy moves away and opens RIGHT later. Keep moving toward (0,1) apple while staying safe. Avoid moving RIGHT until enemy is far.  \n\nDOWN",

No \u2014 in Snake, growth happens after move: this turn I move to (0,1) and eat apple, so my tail stays where it was (2,8), but next turn when I move, my tail will not move (so length increases by 1).

Actually check: (1,2) is enemy body currently, but enemy moves this turn \u2014 could vacate? Possibly, but risky.  \n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each safe move:  \n\n**DOWN to (0,0):**  \nNext turn from (0,0):  \n- UP to (0,1): my body (old head) \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT: off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT to (1,0): empty now, likely safe next turn unless enemy moves there.  \nSo only one safe follow-up (RIGHT). That\u2019s risky \u2014 if (1,0) becomes unsafe next turn, I\u2019m trapped.  \n\n**RIGHT to (1,1):**  \nNext turn from (1,1):  \n- UP to (1,2): currently enemy body at (1,2), but enemy moves this turn. Could become empty if enemy moves away. Could also stay occupied if enemy doesn\u2019t move that segment. Safer to assume it\u2019s risky.  \n- DOWN to (1,0): empty, safe.  \n- LEFT to (0,1): my body \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT to (2,1): currently enemy body at (2,1) \u2192 likely death.  \nSo likely safe follow-ups: only DOWN to (1,0). That\u2019s also one safe move next turn.  \n\nBoth options leave me with only one safe move next turn \u2014 but (1,1) at least keeps me closer to apples (1,9)/(2,9) if I can find a path upward later.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider enemy movement:**  \nEnemy\u2019s head at (5,7) could move toward apples at (7,7) or (8,8). If enemy goes RIGHT to (6,7), then (7,7) is two steps away. That doesn\u2019t immediately threaten me.  \n\nMy priority: avoid being trapped next turn.  \nFrom (0,0), only (1,0) is safe next turn \u2014 but (1,0) is close to enemy tail at (4,0). Enemy could move toward bottom left? Unlikely.  \nFrom (1,1), only (1,0) is safe next turn \u2014 same issue.  \n\nActually, check (1,0) safety next turn:  \nIf I go RIGHT to (1,1) now, next turn I go DOWN to (1,0). From (1,0) the turn after:  \n- UP back to (1,1): my body \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT to (0,0): empty? Possibly safe if I didn\u2019t come from there.  \n- RIGHT to (2,0): empty now.  \nSo from (1,0) I\u2019d have LEFT and RIGHT safe \u2014 that\u2019s better.  \n\nSo sequence: RIGHT now to (1,1), then DOWN next turn to (1,0) gives me two safe moves afterward.  \nIf I go DOWN now to (0,0), then RIGHT next turn to (1,0) \u2014 same eventual position (1,0) but one turn later.  \n\nBut going RIGHT now keeps me closer to top apples and avoids the dead-end at (0,0) immediately.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nGet to (1,0) via (1,1) \u2192 (1,0), then move right along bottom row to (2,0),(3,0), etc., then up column 3 or 4 to approach apples (7,1) eventually, while avoiding enemy\u2019s central block. Enemy\u2019s long body is mostly left side, so right side (columns 5\u20139) is safer.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT to (1,1) is safe now and leads to a path toward more open space and apples.  \n\nRIGHT",

(2, 9) and (1, 9) - multiple cells away but also reachable\n\n**Enemy Snake Status:**\n- Snake #1 head: (1, 0)\n- Snake #1 can move: UP \u2192 (1, 1) (its own body), LEFT \u2192 (0, 0) (safe), RIGHT \u2192 (2, 0) (safe), DOWN \u2192 invalid\n\n**Direction Viability Check from (7, 7):**\n- UP \u2192 (7, 8): **SAFE!** Empty cell \u2713\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 6): **SAFE!** Empty cell \u2713\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 7): **SAFE!** Empty cell \u2713\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 7): **MY BODY!** Would hit my own segment \u2717\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nAll three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe! RIGHT seems optimal because:\n1. It moves me directly toward the (8, 8) apple (just one more move UP after RIGHT)\n2. It keeps me in the upper-right quadrant where there's more open space\n3. It maintains distance from the enemy snake in the bottom-left\n\nUP would also position me for the (8, 8) apple, but RIGHT first gives me better positioning options and reduces collision risk with my own body.\n\n**Future Planning:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (8, 7), I'll be perfectly positioned to collect (8, 8) next turn with an UP move. This will extend my lead to 16-9. I should maintain this aggressive apple collection strategy while keeping safe margins from my own body and the enemy snake.\n\nRIGHT",

None of these intersect (0,0) or (2,0). No immediate head-on risk.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Next-turn safety for each safe move:**  \n\n**LEFT to (0,0):**  \nFrom (0,0):  \n- UP to (0,1): my body \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT: off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT to (1,0): my old head (now body) \u2192 death.  \nSo from (0,0) next turn, *zero* safe moves \u2192 trapped and dead next turn. So LEFT is a dead end.  \n\n**RIGHT to (2,0):**  \nFrom (2,0):  \n- UP to (2,1): enemy body at (2,1) \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT to (1,0): my body \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT to (3,0): empty, safe.  \nSo only RIGHT from (2,0) is safe next turn. That\u2019s one safe follow-up.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term pathing:**  \nFrom (2,0), only RIGHT to (3,0) is safe next turn. From (3,0), I can go RIGHT to (4,0), then (5,0), etc., staying along bottom row to avoid enemy body in columns 1\u20134 above y=0. Apple at (7,1) is reachable via (6,0)\u2192(7,0)\u2192UP to (7,1). Enemy is far away in top half. This keeps me alive and moving toward an apple.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider apple at (2,3):**  \nIt\u2019s close but blocked by enemy body at (2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4). To reach (2,3) I\u2019d need to go up from (2,0) to (2,1) which is enemy body \u2192 death. So not reachable safely now.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT leads to immediate trap next turn. RIGHT leads to a narrow but viable path along bottom row toward apple (7,1). Choose RIGHT.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2,0) next turn, must go RIGHT to (3,0). Then continue RIGHT along bottom row to (6,0), then go UP to (6,1) or (7,1) for apple. Avoid going into columns 1\u20134 above y=0 until enemy moves away.

Actually apple was at (2,8) not (8,8) \u2014 board shows 0 at (8,8) meaning enemy head is there now, so it moved UP from (8,7) to (8,8) last turn and ate apple (1,9) or (2,9)? Wait, apples listed: (1,9),(2,9),(7,1),(2,3),(2,8). Enemy at (8,8) didn't eat any of those unless apple (2,8) was eaten last turn \u2014 but board shows '.' at (2,8) now, so yes, enemy ate (2,8) last turn. So enemy length is now 17.  \n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety from (3,0):**  \n- UP to (3,1): enemy body at (3,1) \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT to (2,0): my body \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT to (4,0): empty, safe.  \n\nOnly RIGHT is safe again.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy head at (8,8) can move UP to (8,9) (empty), DOWN to (8,7) (its body), LEFT to (7,8) (empty), RIGHT to (9,8) (empty). None intersect (4,0). No immediate head-on risk.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Next-turn safety if I go RIGHT to (4,0):**  \nFrom (4,0):  \n- UP to (4,1): empty.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT to (3,0): my old head (now body) \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT to (5,0): empty.  \n\nSo next turn I\u2019d have UP and RIGHT safe. That\u2019s better than being forced into only RIGHT again.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term pathing:**  \nFrom (4,0), I can go UP toward apple (7,1) via (4,0)\u2192(5,0)\u2192(6,0)\u2192(7,0)\u2192UP to (7,1), or go UP earlier to explore middle board. But enemy is in top-right, so staying low is safer.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider enemy movement:**  \nEnemy likely will go UP to (8,9) for apple (1,9) or (2,9), or LEFT to (7,8) to avoid edge. It\u2019s far from me.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nOnly RIGHT is safe now, so must take it.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (4,0) next turn, I will have UP and RIGHT safe. Prefer RIGHT to (5,0) to continue along bottom, then (6,0), then (7,0), then UP to apple (7,1). Monitor enemy; if it moves toward bottom, be ready to go UP earlier to avoid.  \n\nRIGHT",

Check for immediate death**  \nMy body: [(4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)]  \n- UP (5,1): not in my body, not off board.  \n- LEFT (4,0): in my body (second segment) \u2192 **dead**  \n- RIGHT (6,0): not in my body, not off board.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT.  \n\n**3. Enemy snake #0**  \nHead at (6, 8), body long.  \nEnemy\u2019s possible moves: UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8).  \nEnemy body: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]  \n\nCheck if enemy could move into my potential head positions this turn:  \n- Enemy moving DOWN to (6,7) \u2192 not my UP (5,1) or RIGHT (6,0).  \n- Enemy moving LEFT to (5,8) \u2192 not my squares.  \n- Enemy moving RIGHT to (7,8) \u2192 no.  \n- Enemy moving UP to (6,9) \u2192 no.  \n\nNo risk of head-on collision this turn because enemy is far away.  \n\n**4. Apples reachable**  \nApples: (1,9), (2,9), (7,1), (2,3), (2,8)  \nFrom (5,0):  \n- UP (5,1): distance to (7,1) = |5-7|+|1-1| = 2  \n- RIGHT (6,0): distance to (7,1) = |6-7|+|0-1| = 2  \n\nBoth equally close to (7,1) in Manhattan distance.  \n\n**5. Future options after each safe move**  \nFrom (5,1): possible next moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) except into own body.  \nFrom (6,0): possible next moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) \u2014 LEFT is (5,0) which will be my neck (currently head) so safe next turn? Wait, next turn my body will be: new head at (6,0), old head (5,0) becomes second segment, tail moves unless I eat apple (no apple at (6,0)). So (5,0) will be body next turn, so LEFT from (6,0) next turn would be into body \u2192 not safe. So from (6,0) next turn, only UP, RIGHT, DOWN (check DOWN (6,-1) off board? No, y=-1 off board \u2192 dead). So from (6,0) next turn only UP and RIGHT safe. That\u2019s 2 options.  \n\nFrom (5,1) next turn: body will be [(5,0), (4,0), \u2026], so possible moves: UP (5,2), DOWN (5,0) body \u2192 dead, LEFT (4,1) free, RIGHT (6,1) free. So 3 safe options next turn from (5,1).  \n\nThus UP gives more future flexibility.  \n\n**6. Long-term plan note**  \nI have 9 apples vs enemy\u2019s 16. Need to catch up but safely. The apples at (7,1) are closest; moving UP then possibly RIGHT+UP to get it while avoiding enemy\u2019s long body. Enemy is in top area, I\u2019m at bottom, so moving up is good to access more apples. Avoid trapping myself in left side later.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP gives more options and moves toward apple (7,1).  \n\nUP",

Then consider moving UP toward (2, 8) or (2, 9) apples while avoiding enemy\u2019s long body in top rows.

Apples reachable**  \nApples: (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 8), (6, 0)  \nFrom (7, 1):  \n- UP (7, 2): closest apple (2, 3) distance 6, (2, 8) distance 7.  \n- DOWN (7, 0): closest apple (6, 0) distance 1 (adjacent).  \n- RIGHT (8, 1): closest apple (2, 3) distance 7.  \n\nDOWN gets me next to apple at (6, 0), which I can eat next turn if I move there.  \n\n**5. Future options after each safe move**  \nFrom (7, 2) after UP:  \nBody next turn: [(7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), \u2026]  \nPossible moves from (7, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (7, 3) free  \n- DOWN (7, 1) body \u2192 dead  \n- LEFT (6, 2) free  \n- RIGHT (8, 2) free  \n\nSo 3 safe moves after UP.  \n\nFrom (7, 0) after DOWN:  \nBody next turn: [(7, 0), (7, 1), (6, 1), \u2026]  \nPossible moves from (7, 0) next turn:  \n- UP (7, 1) body \u2192 dead  \n- DOWN (7, -1) off board \u2192 dead  \n- LEFT (6, 0) free  \n- RIGHT (8, 0) free  \n\nSo 2 safe moves after DOWN (LEFT or RIGHT).  \n\nFrom (8, 1) after RIGHT:  \nBody next turn: [(8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), \u2026]  \nPossible moves from (8, 1) next turn:  \n- UP (8, 2) free  \n- DOWN (8, 0) free  \n- LEFT (7, 1) body \u2192 dead  \n- RIGHT (9, 1) free  \n\nSo 3 safe moves after RIGHT.  \n\n**6. Risk assessment**  \nDOWN puts me next to apple (6, 0) for next turn, but enemy is far away.  \nUP and RIGHT keep more space open, but no immediate apple.  \nGiven enemy has 16 apples vs my 10, I need to eat apples faster.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nGo DOWN now, then next turn eat apple at (6, 0) if safe. After that, consider moving up the right side (columns 8\u20139) to approach top apples (1,9) and (2,9) while avoiding enemy\u2019s long body wall in columns 2\u20134.  \n\nDOWN",

My position and possible moves now**  \nHead at (7, 0).  \nBody: [(7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]  \nLength = 11 (10 apples + 1 initial head).  \n\nPossible moves from (7, 0):  \n- UP (7, 1): my body segment \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (7, -1): off board \u2192 dead.  \n- LEFT (6, 0): free (no body, no enemy body currently there).  \n- RIGHT (8, 0): free.  \n\nOnly safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**2. Enemy snake #0**  \nHead at (2, 8).  \nBody: [(3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4)]  \nLength = 18 (17 apples + 1 initial head).  \n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (2, 8):  \n- UP (2, 9): apple there, but also possible collision with my future move? No, I\u2019m far away.  \n- DOWN (2, 7): body \u2192 dead.  \n- LEFT (1, 8): free.  \n- RIGHT (3, 8): body \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP or LEFT this turn.  \n\n**3. Apples**  \nApples at: (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 3), (6, 0), (0, 2)  \n\nFrom my head (7, 0):  \n- LEFT to (6, 0): apple there \u2192 eat immediately, grow to length 12.  \n- RIGHT to (8, 0): no apple.  \n\n**4. Future safety after each safe move**  \n\n**LEFT to (6, 0) (eat apple):**  \nNew body next turn: head (6, 0), then (7, 0), (7, 1), \u2026 tail (0, 1) stays.  \nFrom (6, 0) next turn:  \n- UP (6, 1): body (7, 1) will be at (7, 1) still? Wait, after moving, body order: head (6,0), old head (7,0) becomes second segment, (7,1) third segment. So (6,1) is free? Check: current body has (6,1) as second segment, but after eating apple, tail doesn\u2019t move, so (6,1) remains in body? Actually:  \nCurrent body: [(7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)]  \nAfter LEFT to (6,0) and eating apple: new head (6,0), add old head (7,0) as second, then whole old body shifts: new body = [(6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)]  \nSo (6,1) is fourth segment, not adjacent to new head except via (7,0) and (7,1). Adjacent cells to (6,0):  \nUP (6,1): body segment (fourth) \u2192 dead.  \nDOWN (6,-1): off board \u2192 dead.  \nLEFT (5,0): body segment (sixth) \u2192 dead.  \nRIGHT (7,0): body segment (second) \u2192 dead.  \n\nOh! That\u2019s a trap: after eating apple at (6,0), all four moves from (6,0) next turn are deadly. That means I\u2019d die next turn unless an apple appears in one of those spots (unlikely). So eating that apple now is suicide.  \n\n**RIGHT to (8, 0) (no apple):**  \nNew body next turn: head (8,0), then (7,0), (7,1), (6,1), \u2026 tail (0,1).  \nFrom (8,0) next turn:  \n- UP (8,1): free.  \n- DOWN (8,-1): off board \u2192 dead.  \n- LEFT (7,0): body segment (second) \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (9,0): free.  \n\nSo 2 safe moves next turn (UP or RIGHT).  \n\n**5. Enemy movement effects**  \nEnemy can go UP to (2,9) (eat apple) or LEFT to (1,8).  \nIf enemy goes UP, it grows, extending its body wall near top.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT, it moves toward (1,9) apple possibly next turn.  \n\nEither way, enemy is far from me now.  \n\n**6. Decision**  \nLEFT leads to certain death next turn (trapped after eating).  \nRIGHT keeps me alive with 2 options next turn.  \n\nFrom (8,0) next turn, I can go UP to (8,1) and then possibly toward column 9 and up to top apples (1,9) or (2,9) if enemy hasn\u2019t taken them.  \n\nLong-term plan:  \nAvoid trapping myself. Go RIGHT now, then UP next turn to (8,1). From there, assess path to top apples while staying away from enemy\u2019s long body. Keep space open along right edge (columns 8\u20139) since enemy occupies left/middle.  \n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s check: My body after moving RIGHT: new head (9,1), old head (8,1) becomes segment 1, (8,0) segment 2, (7,0) segment 3, etc. So (9,0) is free now (apple at (6,0) not there).

Both far from my possible moves (8, 2) or (9, 1).

(5, 6) is near enemy\u2019s territory. (2, 3) is near enemy\u2019s tail maybe.  \n- I need to avoid being trapped in bottom right corner. UP gives more options next turn.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gives more future mobility (3 safe moves next turn vs 2 from RIGHT).

So 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n2. **LEFT to (7,2)**  \n   - No apple.  \n   - Next turn from (7,2): UP (7,3) empty, DOWN (7,1) body (segment 3 after move), LEFT (6,2) empty, RIGHT (8,2) body (segment 1 after move). So 2 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT).  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (9,2)**  \n   - No apple.  \n   - Next turn from (9,2): UP (9,3) apple, DOWN (9,1) empty, LEFT (8,2) body (segment 1 after move), RIGHT off board. So 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN).  \n\n**Enemy collision risk this turn:**  \nEnemy moving DOWN to (0,8) is far away, no head-on collision possible.  \n\n**Longer-term planning:**  \n- Enemy is long and occupies top rows, but currently moving down.  \n- Apple at (9,3) is reachable in 2 turns if I go RIGHT now then UP next turn, but that puts me at board edge with fewer options.  \n- Apple at (2,3) is near enemy\u2019s tail but also near my own body\u2019s tail region; could be risky if enemy moves down further.  \n- Apple at (6,0) is near my tail but also near my body; might be safe later.  \n- I want to stay flexible and avoid being trapped in corners. UP gives more options next turn (3 safe moves) and keeps me central.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP maximizes future mobility and avoids immediate danger. From (8,3) next turn, I can consider moving toward (9,3) if safe, or go left toward center.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (8,3), check if (9,3) is safe to take (enemy far away), but prioritize keeping at least 2 escape routes. Avoid moving into top rows where enemy body is dense.  \n\nUP",

Next turn from (7,3):  \n- UP (7,4): empty.  \n- DOWN (7,2): my body (segment 2 after move).  \n- LEFT (6,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (8,3): empty (my old head).  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term:**  \nEnemy is long and controls top rows, but moving down/right. I should avoid getting trapped near edges.  \nRIGHT gets apple now but puts me on right edge; still safe next turn but fewer options if enemy approaches later.  \nUP keeps me central with maximum options next turn, lets me possibly go for (5,6) or (9,3) later.  \n\nGiven enemy is far, I can afford to take apple now without huge risk. But apple at (9,3) might be contested if enemy moves toward center later \u2014 but not this turn.\n\n---\n\n**7. Decision:**  \nTaking apple now is beneficial for catching up in score (10 vs 19).  \nRIGHT (9,3) is safe this turn and gives 3 safe moves next turn, which is acceptable.  \nUP gives more flexibility but delays eating.  \n\nGiven the score gap, I should take apple when safe. RIGHT is safe and gets apple.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,3), avoid moving right (off board). Prefer UP or LEFT to stay safe and move toward center. Watch enemy\u2019s possible approach from left side.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait \u2014 last turn I moved RIGHT to (9,3) and ate apple there. So now my length should be 12. But the body list shows 11 segments after head. Let's check: head (9,3) + 11 body segments = total length 12. Yes, matches apples collected 11 \u2192 length 12.\n\nApples: (2,3), (6,0), (0,2), (5,6), (6,5) \u2014 note (9,3) was eaten last turn.\n\nEnemy head: (0,7)  \nEnemy body: [(0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6)]  \nLength = 20.\n\n---\n\n**1. Immediate safe moves from (9,3):**  \n- UP (9,4): empty.  \n- DOWN (9,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (8,3): currently my body segment 1, but after this turn\u2019s move, my body will shift \u2014 actually, if I move, my tail moves only if I don\u2019t eat an apple. This turn I\u2019m not on an apple, so my tail (3,0) will move off that cell, and my body shifts forward. So (8,3) will become my neck, not occupied by my body after movement. Wait carefully:  \n\nCurrent body: (8,3) is directly behind head. If I move LEFT to (8,3), that\u2019s moving backwards into my own body segment 1 \u2014 that\u2019s illegal (rule: moving directly backwards into your own body counts as hitting yourself). So LEFT is unsafe.  \n\n- RIGHT: off board \u2192 dead.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy possible moves from (0,7):**  \nEnemy\u2019s body: (0,8) is behind head, so enemy can\u2019t move UP (into own body).  \nDOWN (0,6): empty.  \nLEFT (-1,7): off board \u2192 dead.  \nRIGHT (1,7): empty.  \nSo enemy can go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nEnemy\u2019s possible next heads: (0,6) or (1,7).  \nNo collision risk with my possible moves (UP to 9,4 or DOWN to 9,2).\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple reachability:**  \nClosest apple to me: (6,5) is 5 cells away Manhattan, (5,6) is 5 away, others farther.  \nFrom (9,3):  \n- UP then eventually left toward (6,5) or (5,6).  \n- DOWN then left toward (6,0) maybe, but that\u2019s near my tail area.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future mobility:**  \nFrom (9,4):  \nUP (9,5) empty, DOWN (9,3) empty after move, LEFT (8,4) empty, RIGHT off board \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nFrom (9,2):  \nUP (9,3) empty after move, DOWN (9,1) empty, LEFT (8,2) currently my body segment 2, but after move? Let\u2019s simulate: if I move DOWN, my body shifts: head to (9,2), neck (9,3), then (8,3), (8,2) becomes 4th segment? Wait, current body: (8,3),(8,2),(8,1)... So after moving DOWN to (9,2), body becomes: (9,3),(8,3),(8,2),(8,1)... So (8,2) is occupied by my 3rd segment. So LEFT to (8,2) would be into my own body \u2192 unsafe next turn. So from (9,2) next turn: UP safe, DOWN safe, LEFT unsafe, RIGHT off board \u2192 only 2 safe moves.  \n\nSo UP gives better future mobility than DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is long, controls top/center. I\u2019m on right edge. Need to get away from edge to avoid dead ends. UP moves along edge but next turn I can go LEFT to (8,4) into more open space. DOWN puts me near bottom edge and my own body, limiting options.\n\nGiven score gap (11 vs 19), I need to survive and eat apples safely. UP is safer for future options.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,4), move LEFT to (8,4) to get away from edge, then aim for apple at (6,5) or (5,6). Watch enemy movement toward center.\n\nUP",

Immediate safe moves from (9,4):**  \n- UP (9,5): empty.  \n- DOWN (9,3): currently my neck (first body segment), but after movement, my tail moves, so (9,3) will be empty unless I eat an apple (I won't be on apple at (9,4)). So DOWN is safe (not moving backwards because neck is at (9,3) and moving DOWN to (9,3) would be backwards? Wait: my body order is head (9,4), then (9,3) is directly behind me. Moving DOWN to (9,3) is moving directly backwards into my own body \u2192 that's illegal and kills me. So DOWN is unsafe.  \n- LEFT (8,4): empty.  \n- RIGHT: off board \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy possible moves from (0,6):**  \nEnemy's neck is at (0,7) (behind head).  \n- UP (0,7): into own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (0,5): empty.  \n- LEFT: off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (1,6): empty.  \n\nEnemy can go DOWN or RIGHT.  \nPossible enemy heads next turn: (0,5) or (1,6).  \nNo direct collision risk with my possible moves (UP to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,4)).\n\n---\n\n**3. Future mobility:**  \nFrom (9,5):  \nUP (9,6) empty, DOWN (9,4) empty after move, LEFT (8,5) empty, RIGHT off board \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nFrom (8,4):  \nUP (8,5) empty, DOWN (8,3) currently my 2nd body segment, but after move? Let's simulate: if I move LEFT to (8,4), my body shifts: head (8,4), neck (9,4), then (9,3), (8,3), (8,2)... So (8,3) will be my 3rd segment. So DOWN to (8,3) would be into my own body \u2192 unsafe next turn. So from (8,4) next turn: UP safe, LEFT (7,4) empty, RIGHT (9,4) empty, DOWN unsafe \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**4.

Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is long and controls top/center. I'm on right edge. Need to get away from edge to avoid dead ends. LEFT to (8,4) opens more central space and is closer to apples. UP keeps me on edge, limiting future options after that.  \n\nGiven the score gap (11 vs 19), I need to collect apples safely. LEFT is better for approaching (6,5) or (5,6) while keeping future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,4), consider moving UP to (8,5) or LEFT to (7,4) to continue toward apples while avoiding enemy's possible path. Monitor enemy's move toward (0,5) or (1,6) \u2014 they are far away for now.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy possible moves from (0,2):**  \nEnemy\u2019s neck is at (0,3) (behind head).  \n- UP (0,3): into own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (0,1): empty.  \n- LEFT: off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (1,2): empty.  \n\nEnemy can go DOWN to (0,1) or RIGHT to (1,2).  \nEnemy is far from me (Manhattan distance 6). No immediate collision risk in one move.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple proximity:**  \nFrom my head (6,5):  \n- (5,6): distance 2 (UP+LEFT or LEFT+UP)  \n- (5,9): distance 5  \n- (9,9): distance 7  \n- (2,3): distance 6  \n- (6,0): distance 5  \n\nClosest apple is (5,6).  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\nIf I go UP to (6,6):  \nFrom (6,6):  \n- UP (6,7): empty.  \n- DOWN (6,5): my old head (body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (5,6): apple.  \n- RIGHT (7,6): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (5,5):  \nFrom (5,5):  \n- UP (5,6): apple.  \n- DOWN (5,4): empty.  \n- LEFT (4,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT (6,5): my old head (body) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,5):  \nFrom (7,5):  \n- UP (7,6): empty.  \n- DOWN (7,4): my body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (6,5): my old head (body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (8,5): empty.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, RIGHT).  \n\nThus RIGHT is worse for future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**5. Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy at (0,2) can\u2019t reach any of my candidate squares in one move. No immediate head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m behind 12 apples vs 20 apples. Need to eat apples quickly but safely.  \n(5,6) is the nearest apple.  \nGoing LEFT now to (5,5) sets me up to eat (5,6) next turn if safe.  \nGoing UP to (6,6) also sets up to eat (5,6) next turn (by moving LEFT from (6,6)).  \nBut UP then LEFT from (6,6) to (5,6) might be slightly safer because it keeps distance from enemy\u2019s long body in the top right area? Actually enemy body is mostly top and right edges, but (5,6) is clear now.  \n\nCheck enemy\u2019s possible future moves: enemy might move toward (2,3) apple eventually, but not an immediate threat.  \n\nI think going LEFT now to (5,5) is slightly more direct toward (5,6) and gives same mobility as UP.  \nBut going UP to (6,6) keeps more central position and avoids moving too close to my own body\u2019s loop near (6,1)-(7,1)-(7,0)-(8,0) etc.  \n\nActually, from (5,5), if I go UP to (5,6) next turn, I\u2019ll eat apple and grow, but then my tail is still at (6,1) for a while, so I\u2019ll have a long body wrapping around bottom right. Need to avoid trapping myself.  \n\nGiven the board, I think UP to (6,6) is slightly safer for keeping options open, then next turn decide between LEFT to (5,6) apple or RIGHT/UP to stay safe.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,6), if (5,6) is still there and enemy not threatening, go LEFT to eat it. Otherwise, move to stay safe, perhaps UP or RIGHT to open area.\n\nUP",

Immediate safe moves from (5,7):**  \n- UP (5,8): empty.  \n- DOWN (5,6): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (4,7): empty.  \n- RIGHT (6,7): empty.  \n\nAll except DOWN are safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy possible moves from (2,3):**  \nNeck is at (2,2).  \n- UP (2,4): empty.  \n- DOWN (2,2): own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (1,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,3): empty.  \n\nEnemy can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nEnemy is far (Manhattan distance 5).  \n\n---\n\n**3. Apple proximity:**  \nFrom my head (5,7):  \n- (5,9): distance 2 (UP twice)  \n- (7,9): distance 4  \n- (9,9): distance 6  \n- (5,5): distance 2 (DOWN unsafe)  \n- (6,0): distance 8  \n\nClosest reachable apple is (5,9) via UP then UP.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\nIf I go UP to (5,8):  \nFrom (5,8):  \n- UP (5,9): apple.  \n- DOWN (5,7): my old head (body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (4,8): enemy body at (4,8) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (6,8): enemy body at (6,8) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only UP is safe next turn if I go UP now \u2014 that\u2019s risky (forced move into apple, then maybe trapped).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,7):  \nFrom (4,7):  \n- UP (4,8): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (4,6): empty.  \n- LEFT (3,7): empty.  \n- RIGHT (5,7): my old head (body) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7):  \nFrom (6,7):  \n- UP (6,8): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (6,6): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (5,7): my old head (body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (7,7): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 0 safe moves next turn \u2014 DEAD END. So RIGHT is unsafe in practice (traps me).  \n\nThus:  \n- UP \u2192 only 1 safe move next turn (UP to apple, then maybe stuck after eating).  \n- LEFT \u2192 2 safe moves next turn.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 0 safe moves next turn \u2192 eliminate.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy at (2,3) cannot reach (5,8) or (4,7) in one move. No immediate risk.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m behind 13 vs 21 apples. Need to eat apples but survive.  \nGoing UP now leads to (5,8) and then forced to (5,9) apple next turn, but after eating (5,9), my head will be at (5,9) with body behind at (5,8) and (5,7) etc. From (5,9) after eating:  \n- UP (5,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (5,8) \u2192 body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (4,9) \u2192 empty? Yes, board shows empty at (4,9).  \n- RIGHT (6,9) \u2192 apple at (7,9) nearby but (6,9) empty.  \nSo after eating (5,9), I\u2019d have 2 moves (LEFT, RIGHT) \u2014 not terrible.  \n\nGoing LEFT to (4,7) avoids immediate trap but moves away from apples.  \n\nGiven the scores, I need to catch up. UP \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 (5,9) apple seems viable if I can survive the turn after eating it.  \n\nCheck enemy\u2019s possible interference:  \nEnemy at (2,3) could go UP to (2,4), then (2,5), etc., not near (5,9) in 2 turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP is safe now and leads to apple in 1 more move. The risk is being forced into the apple next turn with limited exits, but after eating, I\u2019ll have some space.  \nLEFT is safe but delays eating.  \nRIGHT is a trap.  \n\nI\u2019ll go UP to progress toward apple and keep pressure.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,8), only safe move will be UP to (5,9) apple. Eat it, then from (5,9) choose LEFT or RIGHT to escape top edge. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s long body on right side.  \n\nUP",
