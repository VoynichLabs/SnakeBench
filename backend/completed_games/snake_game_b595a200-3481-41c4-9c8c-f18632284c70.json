This is a guaranteed self-collision and leads to death. Eliminated.\n   - **LEFT**: Leads to (0,5), which would cause the snake's head to overlap with the second body segment (0,5) after the move. This is a guaranteed self-collision and leads to death. Eliminated.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves the head to (2,5). Safe from own body collisions and within the board. Provides a direct path toward multiple apples (e.g., (5,3), (5,1)) and avoids immediate threats from enemies.\n\n2. **Safety and Strategy**:\n   - **Collision Avoidance**: RIGHT avoids self-collision and remains within the board.\n   - **Apple Progression**: RIGHT moves the snake toward apples at (5,3) and (5,1), which are in the same column as the enemy's snake. While this risks proximity to the enemy, the move itself is not immediately dangerous and allows for strategic positioning.\n   - **Enemy Positioning**: The enemy snake is currently at (5,4) with a body extending downward. Moving RIGHT into column 5 may risk future collisions, but the immediate move is safe, and the enemy's movement is unpredictable. By moving RIGHT, we can evade if necessary.\n\n3. **Apples and Growth**:\n   - The apple at (5,1) and (5,3) are in separate paths. RIGHT is a critical move to reach these apples quickly before the enemy or leading column blocks the path. Eating an apple grows the snake, enabling flexibility in movement and higher survival chances.\n\n4. **Long-Term Strategy**:\n   - Prioritize apple collection while avoiding immediate danger. RIGHT gives an optimal path toward multiple targets and maintains strategic positioning to evade the enemy snake at (5,4). Avoiding leftward or downward movements now is critical to prevent near-collisions and restricted paths.\n\n### Decision:\nRIGHT\n\n### Strategy Note to Future Self:\nFocus on maintaining proximity to apples in column 5 and column 8 while staying aware of Snake #0's potential movements. Avoid repetitive leftward movements to prevent being trapped near your own body. If forced to turn, prioritize upward movement to escape column 5 entirely.",

The rules say \"The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 30 apples.\" But that seems too high for a 10x10 board. Let me re-read...\n\nActually, looking again: \"The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 30 apples. If multiple snakes reach 30 or more on the same turn, the snake with the higher apple count wins that round; if tied, it is a draw.\"\n\nBut the scores show I have 5 apples and enemy has 4. That means 30 is indeed the win condition, not 5. So I haven't won yet - I need 30 apples total.\n\nAvailable moves:\n- UP: (5,1) \u2192 (5,2) - INVALID! This would move into my own body segment at (5,2).\n- DOWN: (5,1) \u2192 (5,0) - VALID\n- LEFT: (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) - VALID\n- RIGHT: (5,1) \u2192 (6,1) - VALID\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP is invalid - I can't move backwards into my own body)\n\nStrategic considerations:\n1. I need to get to 30 apples to win (enemy has 4, I have 5)\n2. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) and could move towards various apples\n3. I should avoid moving into my own body segments\n4. I need to position myself to intercept an apple while avoiding the enemy\n\nLooking at available apples and distances from my current position (5,1):\n- Apple at (3,0): Distance = |5-3| + |1-0| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps\n- Apple at (8,1): Distance = |5-8| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3 steps\n- Apple at (8,4): Distance = |5-8| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6 steps\n- Apple at (0,0): Distance = |5-0| + |1-0| = 5 + 1 = 6 steps\n- Apple at (4,9): Distance = |5-4| + |1-9| = 1 + 8 = 9 steps\n\nEnemy snake #1 analysis:\n- At (3,6) with body at (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (0,5)\n- Distance to apple at (3,0): |3-3| + |6-0| = 0 + 6 = 6 steps\n- Distance to apple at (8,1): |3-8| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10 steps\n- Distance to apple at (8,4): |3-8| + |6-4| = 5 + 2 = 7 steps\n- Distance to apple at (0,0): |3-0| + |6-0| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps\n- Distance to apple at (4,9): |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps\n\nMove analysis:\n- DOWN to (5,0): This moves me closer to the apple at (3,0). Next turn I could move LEFT to (4,0), then LEFT to (3,0). This is a good move.\n- LEFT to (4,1): This moves me away from the apple at (8,1) but towards the apple at (3,0). Next turn I could move LEFT to (3,1), then DOWN to (3,0). This is also good.\n- RIGHT to (6,1): This moves me away from the apple at (3,0) and towards the apple at (8,1). Next turn I could move RIGHT to (7,1), then RIGHT to (8,1). This is also good.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position and potential moves:\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (3,6) and could move DOWN to (3,5), LEFT to (2,6), or RIGHT to (4,6). Moving UP would hit its own body.\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (3,5), then to (3,4), etc., it could potentially get to the apple at (3,0) in 6 moves.\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (4,6), then DOWN to (4,5), etc., it could potentially get to the apple at (4,9) in 4 moves.\n\nThe apple at (4,9) is closest to the enemy, so they might go for that one. The apples at (3,0) and (8,1) are equally close to me.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see my body extends from (5,1) to (5,6). Moving DOWN to (5,0) puts me at the bottom of the board, which might limit my future options. Moving LEFT to (4,1) or RIGHT to (6,1) gives me more flexibility.\n\nBetween LEFT and RIGHT, the apple at (3,0) is slightly closer to the enemy (6 steps) than the apple at (8,1) (10 steps), so the enemy is more likely to go for (3,0). However, I'm much closer to both apples than the enemy is.\n\nThe best move is RIGHT to (6,1) which puts me closer to the apple at (8,1) and gives me good flexibility for future moves.\n\n**PLAN**\nMove RIGHT to (6,1) to get closer to the apple at (8,1). On the next turn, I should be able to move RIGHT again to (7,1) and then RIGHT to (8,1) to eat the apple. This will give me 6 apples total.\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",
