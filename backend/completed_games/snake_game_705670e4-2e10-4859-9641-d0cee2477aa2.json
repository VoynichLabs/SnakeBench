The rival could then move **DOWN** to (8,4) and sit right above me. That limits my next\u2011turn options and gives him a chance to squeeze me against the right wall.  \n- If I go **DOWN** to (9,2) I stay glued to the far\u2011right wall. The rival can\u2019t reach my new cell this turn, and I keep a clear vertical corridor (9,2\u202f\u2192\u202f9\u202f\u2192\u202f0). From the bottom I can swing left, grab the many apples on the left side, and later cut the rival off without risking a head\u2011on while I\u2019m still behind.\n\n**Short\u2011term game plan**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **DOWN** now \u2192 secure the safe column.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep marching down: (9,1), (9,0) unless an apple pops up in the column.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 When the column is cleared, swing left along the bottom, harvest apples, and then start hemming the rival in from the left side.\n\nStaying on the wall gives me the most freedom, protects me from an immediate head\u2011on, and lets me hunt the apple\u2011rich left half of the board. Let\u2019s keep the pressure and grow! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",
