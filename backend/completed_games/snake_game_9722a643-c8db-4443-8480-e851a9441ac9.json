The closest apple to our snake is at (2, 3), but there's also an apple at (3, 7) which might be more accessible given our current position and the presence of Snake #1 at (2, 9).\n\nSince our goal is to collect apples without running into walls, other snakes, or ourselves, we need to choose a direction that moves us towards an apple while minimizing risks. Given that Snake #1 is at (2, 9) and we are at (1, 9), moving right is not advisable as it would put us in direct conflict with Snake #1.\n\nMoving down seems like a viable option as it brings us closer to the apples at (2, 3) and (3, 7) without immediately threatening us with Snake #1. However, we should keep in mind the position of other apples and plan our moves to maximize our growth and points.\n\nA potential strategy could be to aim for the apple at (3, 7) first, as it seems to be in a relatively safer position compared to the cluster of apples at (6, x), which might attract more competition from other snakes.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best initial move would be to start moving down towards the apple at (3, 7), avoiding direct conflict with Snake #1.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
