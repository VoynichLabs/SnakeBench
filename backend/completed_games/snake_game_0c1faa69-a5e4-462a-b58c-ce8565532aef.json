Time to break it down and make the play. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick status check:\n- Me (ID 1) head: (1,7)\n- Opponent (ID 0) head: (6,5)\n- Scores: 0 \u2014 0 (no reason to force a head-on KO yet)\n- No bodies in the way. Apples exist but we're focusing on boxing the enemy.\n\nDecision thinking (thinking out loud for the stream, fans love this):  \n1) Evaluate all 4 moves from (1,7):\n- UP -> (1,8): safe. Moves TOWARD the top edge. Good for access to (0,8) apple nearby, but it actually moves us AWAY from the enemy (increases distance). Fewer aggressive options if we drift up.\n- DOWN -> (1,6): safe. Moves us closer to the cluster of apples and toward the opponent a bit. Keeps options open, fairly central.\n- LEFT -> (0,7): safe but hugs the left wall. Fewer escape routes (left would be off-board). Risky for getting boxed.\n- RIGHT -> (2,7): safe. Moves us closer to the opponent while staying central. Keeps maximum follow-up flexibility (3 open directions next turn) and lets us pivot toward the enemy or circle around him.\n\n2) Immediate-death check: none of the four moves hits a body or leaves the board. No immediate head-to-head is possible this turn (opponent from (6,5) can only go to (6,6),(6,4),(5,5),(7,5) \u2014 nothing collides with our nearby squares).\n\n3) Aggression & game sense: scores are tied, so we should not willingly suicidal-head-on. We should move to gain positional advantage: close to the opponent but not get cut off ourselves. RIGHT and DOWN both reduce distance; RIGHT keeps us more central (more escape options) than LEFT/UP.\n\nLong-term plan (for next turns \u2014 keep this as our guiding rationale):\n- Play aggressively but smart: approach the opponent and force them toward the board edges and apple-clusters where we can hem them in.  \n- Prioritize keeping 2\u20133 open escape directions to avoid being boxed; favor central squares over hugging walls.  \n- Only force a head-on if we gain a scoring advantage; otherwise use positioning to trap and outmaneuver them for apples and territory control.  \n- If the opponent commits toward their nearby apples (likely right-side cluster), loop around to cut off escape routes and seal them against the edge.\n\nFinal call \u2014 make the move that best balances aggression and freedom: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

They\u2019re up on apples, so NO stupid head-on plays. We want to close and corner, not suicide.\n\nMove options from (2,7):\n- UP -> (2,8): safe, hugs top but drifts away from enemy.\n- DOWN -> (2,6): safe, moves toward their y-level (good).\n- LEFT -> (1,7): safe but hugs wall \u2014 less flexibility.\n- RIGHT -> (3,7): safe, moves toward the enemy while keeping central escape routes.\n\nImmediate-death check: none of these moves are instant death. Opponent cannot legally move into their own tail at (6,5) (that\u2019d be backwards), so their likely replies are (7,6), (7,4), or (8,5). No immediate head-on threat if we take a cautious approach.\n\nTactical reasoning: we\u2019re behind on apples, so we should close distance while keeping multiple escape routes.

Eliminate. No sympathy. \u274c\n   - RIGHT -> (6,6): legal and more aggressive (closes distance to enemy). Puts us one column from them \u2014 riskier because it encourages collision later.\n   - UP -> (5,7): legal, keeps distance, preserves multiple escape options (up/left/right next turn), safer vs forced head-on.\n   - DOWN -> (5,5): legal but retreats and slows our ability to influence the fight.\n\n2) Opponent\u2019s reachable cells this turn from (7,7): (7,8), (7,6), (6,7). None of these can reach (6,6) or (5,7) at the same time to instantly collide with us this turn, but moving RIGHT (toward them) makes future head-on attempts easier for them to bait us into \u2014 and they\u2019ve got the apple lead. We should not initiate a risky head-on when trailing.\n\n3) Choose a move that keeps options open and avoids giving them an easy trap or head-on bait. UP (5,7) keeps lateral and vertical escapes (5,8),(4,7),(6,7) available next turn, while RIGHT moves us into a more confrontational lane.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move UP now to stay safe and maintain flexibility.\n- If opponent drifts left/up and gives space, step right afterward to start hemming them in; if they push toward us, avoid a head-on unless we flip the apple advantage.\n- Prioritize growing when it\u2019s safe to secure box leverage; don\u2019t trade our life for a draw or double-KO while we\u2019re behind.\n\nAlright chat \u2014 play smart, not reckless.
