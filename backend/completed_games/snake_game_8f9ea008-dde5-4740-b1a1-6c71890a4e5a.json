Moving towards (6,1) is tempting but risky with Snake #0 nearby.\n2. Moving towards (2,5) or (0,7) is safer but more indirect.\n3. Staying put provides more observation time but risks letting enemies control the pace.\n\n### Decision:\n\nI will move **UP** (increasing my y coordinate), aiming for (5,4) or higher towards (6,1) if safe.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**",
