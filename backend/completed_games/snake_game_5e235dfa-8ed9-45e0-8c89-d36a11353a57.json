We both have no bodies, so the board is WIDE OPEN! But we gotta start DOMINATING early! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nFirst, I'm checking all moves:\n- UP to (8,5): Safe, but no apple there, and it moves me away from the opponent? Nah, we want to pressure him!\n- DOWN to (8,3): OH SNAP! There's an apple right below me! Eating this gives me growth and +1 score\u2014BOOM! Content already! \ud83c\udf4e And it brings me closer to the bottom where the enemy is lurking? Sorta, since he's at y=1.\n- LEFT to (7,4): Safe, and it moves me DIRECTLY towards the opponent! Aggressive play, but no apple here\u2014so no growth this turn. \ud83d\ude24\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Safe, but why go to the edge? That's asking for trouble later! Trapped against the wall? NO THANKS! \ud83d\ude45\n\nSo between DOWN and LEFT, DOWN gets me that sweet apple and growth, which is key for dominating the board. LEFT is aggressive but no immediate payoff. Since we need to grow to box him in, EATING FIRST is the move! Plus, after eating, I'll have a body at (8,4), so next turn I can't go back, but I'll have options to go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT from (8,3)\u2014keeping me flexible!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After this, I'll push LEFT towards the opponent while snatching apples along the way! Watch for his moves\u2014if he heads up towards (1,5), I might cut him off from the center! We want to force him into a corner where he CRASHES! \ud83d\udea8\n\nCHAT, ARE YOU WITH ME?

Our priority is to **grow fast** without getting boxed in.  \n- **UP** puts us on (1,3) \u2013 still clear, opens the board upward, and pushes us toward the juicy (1,5) apple \ud83c\udf4e three steps away.  \n- **LEFT** would shove us to the wall at x=0, cutting off future escape routes.  \n- **DOWN** lands us near the bottom edge (y=1) \u2013 safe now but we\u2019d lose vertical momentum.  \n- **RIGHT** heads toward the enemy but also puts us on a narrow corridor that could trap us later.  \n\nSo the smart aggressive pick is **UP** \u2013 it keeps multiple safe follow\u2011ups (UP, RIGHT, LEFT) while marching toward an apple and staying out of immediate collision range.  \n\n\ud83e\udde0 Long\u2011term note: Keep climbing upward to snag (1,5) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 \u2026 and force the rival into a head\u2011on clash once we\u2019ve collected enough apples.  \n\nUP",

It moves us away from the enemy... and look at all those apples at (6,3), (5,3), (3,3)... going UP might be running from the feast! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **DOWN to (7,2)**: Safe! Empty space! Puts us right next to an apple at (6,3) if we go LEFT next turn. But is it aggressive enough? We're letting the enemy breathe!\n*   **LEFT to (6,3)**: OHHHH BABY! Look at that! It's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705 We'd GROW to 3 segments AND move DIRECTLY towards the enemy! This is the AGGRESSIVE power-play! But wait... is it safe? The enemy is at (1,3), he can't reach us. Our path is clear. THIS IS THE WAY.\n*   **RIGHT to (8,3)**: ABORT MISSION! \ud83d\udea8\u274c That's our OWN BODY! We'd crash and burn! INSTANT L! NOT AN OPTION!\n\nBETWEEN UP, DOWN, and LEFT:\nLEFT IS THE MOVE! We get bigger, we get stronger, and we push the line towards Snake #1. He's trapped on the left side of the board with us closing in! If he tries to run up for the apple at (1,5), we're cutting off his escape routes!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating the apple at (6,3), we'll have a body of 3. We need to start boxing him in. Next turn, consider going DOWN to (6,2) or LEFT to (5,3) to continue controlling the center and cutting off his access to the bottom-left apples. FORCE HIM INTO THE CORNER! WE GOT THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! LET'S USE IT!\n\nLEFT",

We can't get complacent!\n\nLet's break down our position! Our head is at (5,4), our body is coiled up to the left and behind us. The enemy's head is at (6,5), right next to us! This is a CRITICAL moment! Let's check our moves! \ud83e\uddd0\n\n- **UP to (5,5)**: SAFE? \ud83e\udd14 The cell is empty! BUT CHAT, this is a POTENTIAL HEAD-ON COLLISION WAITING TO HAPPEN! The enemy is at (6,5). If they go LEFT to (5,5) at the same time we go UP to (5,5)... DOUBLE KO! \ud83d\udca5 We have a length advantage (7 vs 4), so we WIN that trade! The enemy probably wants to avoid that... but are they scared enough? This is AGGRESSIVE!\n\n- **DOWN to (5,3)**: DEATH! \ud83d\udea8\u274c That's our own body segment! We're not throwing this lead!\n\n- **LEFT to (4,4)**: DEATH! \ud83d\udea8\u274c Also our own body! We just came from there!\n\n- **RIGHT to (6,4)**: SAFE! \u2705 Empty cell! This moves us AWAY from the enemy's immediate threat. It feels a bit defensive, but it keeps us alive and offers access to the right side of the board.\n\nCHAT, THIS IS A GAMBLE! Do we go for the aggressive UP move, betting the enemy will chicken out and we can claim the space above us? Or do we play it safer with RIGHT?\n\nLet's think about what the enemy will do! Their head is at (6,5). Their body is below them at (6,6), so they CAN'T go DOWN. Their options are:\n- LEFT to (5,5) -> Risks head-on with us if we go UP.\n- UP to (6,6) -> Impossible, that's their own body!\n- RIGHT to (7,5) -> Safe, moves them away.\n\nThey might be too scared to challenge us directly! If we go UP to (5,5), we're asserting DOMINANCE! We're saying this territory is OURS! If they go LEFT, they die and we win! If they go RIGHT, we've successfully cut them off from the top-left and can start boxing them in against the right wall! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** PUSH THE ADVANTAGE! We have the length, we have the score lead. Force the enemy into bad positions. If they run, we chase and use our body to cut the board. If they stand and fight, we win the head-on. DO NOT BACK DOWN! The right side of the board has apples, but positioning to trap the enemy is MORE IMPORTANT! Let's get this bread! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nUP",

Stay aggressive, keep options alive! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Which way to strike? Let's scan the board...\n\nUP \u2192 (7,5) is our own body segment \u2192 instant death. Nope.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7,3) is empty but no apple this turn \u2013 not worth the squeeze.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6,4) is safe but no apple and it narrows our shape.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8,4) holds an \ud83c\udf4e apple! Eating it bumps our score to 5 and keeps us surrounded by open cells (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Perfect for staying flexible and setting up a future apple grab at (8,5) or (9,4).  \n\n\ud83d\udca5 Aggressive move: snatch that apple now, keep the board wide open, and force the opponent into a tight spot.  \n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! TURN 13! WE'RE UP 6-4! THE ENEMY ATE AN APPLE ON THE LAST TURN! Let's see the new board! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nOur head is at **(4, 5)**! The enemy's head is NOW at **(7, 4)**! They moved DOWN to grab that apple at (8,4)! They're getting a little too confident! \ud83d\ude24\n\nAlright, let's check our moves! We gotta be SMART!\n\n*   **UP to (4, 6)**: SAFE! \u2705 That cell is empty! This puts us in a more central position, closer to a BUNCH of apples on the top rows! Content potential! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n*   **DOWN to (4, 4)**: DEATH! \ud83d\udea8\u274c That's OUR OWN BODY! We have a segment right there! No way!\n\n*   **LEFT to (3, 5)**: SAFE! \u2705 Also an empty cell. This moves us away from the enemy, but is that what we want? \ud83e\udd14 We're longer! We should be pushing the advantage!\n\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 5)**: SAFE! \u2705 Another empty cell. This moves us TOWARDS the enemy! This is AGGRESSIVE! I like it! But wait... let's think about what they might do...\n\n**OPPONENT ANALYSIS:** Their head is at (7,4). Their possible moves are:\n- **UP to (7,5)**: Their own body! \u274c DEATH for them!\n- **DOWN to (7,3)**: SAFE for them. \u2705\n- **LEFT to (6,4)**: SAFE for them. \u2705 Moves them towards us!\n- **RIGHT to (8,4)**: That's the apple they JUST ate, so it's empty now! SAFE for them. \u2705\n\nSo they can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. If they go LEFT to (6,4), and we go RIGHT to (5,5)... that puts our heads ADJACENT! That sets up a potential head-on collision NEXT turn! But we have a length advantage (6 vs 4+new segment=5)... so if we collide heads, WE WIN! \ud83d\udc51 That's a risk we can take!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** PUSH THE ENEMY! They are still shorter than us! We need to use our length to control the board and cut off their escape. Moving RIGHT sets up a confrontation. We can then try to force them into a corner or a bad collision. We own the center, they're on the edges! Time to APPLY PRESSURE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",
