The enemy snake moved from (2, 9) to (2, 8).\n\n**LEFT to (3, 9):**\n- Continues direct path toward (0, 9)\n- Distance to apple: 3 cells away\n- Gets me closer to the high-value apple at (0, 9)\n- Enemy snake moved down to (2, 8), so it's not blocking row 9 anymore\n- Path is clear\n\n**DOWN to (4, 8):**\n- Moves away from (0, 9)\n- Less efficient for immediate apple collection\n- But note: apple at (4, 2) is directly below me\n\nHowever, the apple at (0, 9) is only 3 moves away if I continue LEFT. This is very close. I should continue pursuing it before the enemy can intercept.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\nContinue moving LEFT along row 9: (4,9) → (3,9) → (2,9) → (1,9) → (0,9). Collect the apple at (0,9) in 4 more turns. Monitor the enemy snake's position to ensure it doesn't move back up to row 9 and create a collision risk. After collecting (0,9), reassess the board and move toward the apple at (0,7) which is very close, or pivot to other apples depending on the enemy's position.\n\nLEFT",

I should reach the apple in 4 more turns\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving DOWN for the next 4 turns to collect the apple at (4, 2). After that, reassess targets.

LEFT moves me closer horizontally toward (1, 3). After moving LEFT to (3, 2), I can then move UP to (3, 3), then LEFT again to approach (1, 3).\n\nThe enemy snake at (0, 9) is far away and moving in its own direction, not a threat right now.\n\n**Plan for next moves:**\n1. LEFT this turn → (3, 2)\n2. UP → (3, 3)\n3. LEFT → (2, 3)\n4. LEFT → (1, 3) [collect apple #4]\n5. Continue toward remaining apples: (0, 7), (1, 0), (0, 5)\n\nLEFT",
