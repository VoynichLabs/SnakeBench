However, the enemy snake at (4, 0) is blocking the direct path to that apple. Going up or down would not be the best option as it would take me further away from the apples.\n\nConsidering the situation, my strategy is to move RIGHT to get closer to the apples at (6, 1), (6, 2), and (7, 0). This will also put some distance between my snake and the enemy snake, reducing the risk of a direct confrontation.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: RIGHT."

I should move towards that apple.  Moving up or down would put me in danger of hitting the wall or another snake.  Moving left or right would also put me in danger of hitting the wall or another snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to prioritize moving towards apples.
