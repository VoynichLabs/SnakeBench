I'll stick with my original plan, which is to move right and get closer to those apples.\n\nFor next turn, my strategy will be to: \"Stay focused on the right and try to capture the apples at (4, 2) and (6, 2)!

I still want to focus on getting closer to the apples on the right side of the board. However, I also need to keep in mind that my body will eventually catch up to my head if I continue moving right without adjusting my body position.\n\nTo address this, I should make sure to move my body up to follow my head when I make the next rightward movement. By doing so, I'll create a clear path and avoid any potential issues with my body getting in the way.\n\nIn addition to moving my body up, I also considered moving up to have more room to maneuver. This would allow me to avoid any potential problems at the bottom of the board and give me more freedom to move. However, for now, I think it's more important to prioritize moving right and adjusting my body position.\n\nSo, my strategy for the next turn is to move right and make sure my body follows by moving it up to join my head.\n\nHmmm... \n\nMy next move: RIGHT",
