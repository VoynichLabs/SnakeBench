No body there, plenty of room to maneuver\n- DOWN to (6,0): Safe! But puts us on the edge, less options\n- LEFT to (5,1): Safe! Good horizontal movement\n- RIGHT to (7,1): Safe! But edges us closer to the wall\n\nI'm feeling UP to (6,2) right now. Why? It keeps us central, gives us the most flexibility for next turn, and sets us up to potentially cut off snake #0 if they try to move up toward those apples on the top row.\n\nLet's get aggressive and control the board!\n\nUP",

But there's no apple there\n- DOWN to (7,7) - SAFE! Clear path\n- LEFT to (6,8) - NOT SAFE! That's our own body segment!\n- RIGHT to (8,8) - SAFE! Clear path\n\nStrategy time! We gotta BOX THEM IN! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Snake #0 is way below us and to the left\n- They're already much longer (7 segments vs our 2)\n- We need to control central space and cut off their escape routes\n- Multiple apples are above us - perfect for building length\n\nI'm thinking we should:\n1) Move UP to (7,9) to position ourselves better\n2) This keeps us away from snake #0's current position\n3) Opens up multiple paths for next turn\n4) Maintains flexibility for apple collection\n\nUP",
