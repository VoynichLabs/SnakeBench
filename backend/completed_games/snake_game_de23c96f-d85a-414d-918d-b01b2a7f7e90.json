Moving outside the board (0 \u2264 x \u2264 9, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 9).\n2. Moving into your own body (since you have no body yet, this is not a concern yet).\n3. Moving into the enemy's body (but since the enemy has no body, this is also not a concern yet).\n4. Moving into the enemy's head (since the enemy has no body, this is not a concern yet).\n\nSince the enemy has no body, the only immediate concerns are:\n- Moving outside the board.\n- Moving into an apple (which would grow you).\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: (5, 9) \u2192 Valid (y=9 is within bounds).\n2. **DOWN**: (5, 7) \u2192 Valid.\n3. **LEFT**: (4, 8) \u2192 Valid.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 8) \u2192 Valid.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\nThe closest apples are at (5, 2) and (5, 5). The current head is at (5, 8), so moving down or left would be the most direct paths to reach these apples.\n\n### Enemy Movement:\nThe enemy snake has no body, so it cannot block any cells. However, if the enemy moves into a cell that overlaps with your future path, it could become a problem. But since the enemy has no body, it cannot block cells yet.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Immediate Goal**: Move toward the closest apples (5, 2) or (5, 5).\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - If I move down to (5, 7), I can then move down again to (5, 6), (5, 5), and eventually reach (5, 2).\n  - If I move left to (4, 8), I can then move left to (3, 8), (2, 8), etc., but this path is less direct to the apples.\n- **Risk**: Moving down or left does not immediately threaten the enemy or myself, but I must ensure that the enemy does not move into my path in the future.\n\n### Rational:\nMoving down to (5, 7) is the safest and most direct path to reach the apples. This leaves me with options to continue down or turn around if needed.\n\n**DOWN**",

Eating this would grow the snake and secure a direct path toward (9, 3) or (7, 6).\n   - Enemy at (4, 7) is adjacent but stationary. Moving UP avoids immediate collision unless enemy moves aggressively, but no direct threat yet.\n2. **DOWN:** (7, 7) \u2192 Valid (y=7 is within bounds).\n   - No apple here, but moves toward (9, 3) if snake grows.\n   - Enemy is at (4, 7), which is above us.

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s analyze the current state and plan moves methodically, considering both immediate safety and long-term strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Current State Recap (Turn 12)**\n- **Your snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: (6, 7)\n  - Body: [(5, 7)] (tail at (5, 7))\n  - Apples collected: 1 (from (5, 2) on Turn 11)\n  - Apples left: (9, 2), (7, 6), (9, 3)\n- **Enemy (Snake #0):**\n  - Head: (5, 8)\n  - Body: none\n  - Apples: 0\n- **Board state:**\n  - Your head is at (6, 7), tail at (5, 7). Moving **UP** or **LEFT** would collide with the tail (dead).\n  - Snake #0 is stationary at (5, 8). If it moves **DOWN** to (5, 7), it would collide with your tail, but since your tail is at (5, 7), this would kill Snake #0 (and your tail would be eaten by Snake #0). However, Snake #0\u2019s body is empty, so this is a one-time collision that would kill Snake #0 but not you directly. For now, this is a risk we can avoid.\n\n---\n\n### **Safe Moves (Eliminating Immediate Death)**\n1. **UP:** (5, 7) \u2192 Collision with tail \u2192 **DEAD** (eliminated).\n2. **DOWN:** (7, 7) \u2192 Valid (y=7 is within bounds).\n   - No apple here, but moves toward (9, 3) apple if snake grows.\n   - Keeps distance from Snake #0 (which is at (5, 8) and would not attack you directly).\n3. **LEFT:** (5, 7) \u2192 Collision with tail \u2192 **DEAD** (eliminated).\n4. **RIGHT:** (7, 7) \u2192 Valid (x=7 is within bounds).\n   - No apple here, but moves toward (9, 3) or (7, 6) if snake grows.\n\n**Immediate risks:**\n- **UP/LEFT:** Collision with tail \u2192 **DEAD**.\n- **DOWN/RIGHT:** Safe, but RIGHT is less optimal because it doesn\u2019t progress toward (9, 3) as effectively as DOWN.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat Analysis**\n- Snake #0 is stationary at (5, 8). It has no body segments, so it cannot attack you directly unless it moves into your body.\n- If Snake #0 moves **DOWN** to (5, 7), it would collide with your tail at (5, 7), killing Snake #0 but not you. This is a one-time collision that doesn\u2019t affect your survival directly, but it\u2019s worth avoiding if Snake #0 is aggressive.\n- If Snake #0 moves **UP** to (4, 8), it would not interfere with your movement, but we should avoid extending upward if Snake #0 is likely to move toward us.\n\n---\n\n### **Future Considerations**\n- **DOWN to (7, 7):**\n  - Keeps your head away from Snake #0\u2019s potential moves.\n  - Moves you closer to the (9, 3) apple if you grow.\n  - Allows you to extend upward or rightward in future turns if needed.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n  - Less optimal for progressing toward (9, 3) but still safe.\n  - If Snake #0 moves, it\u2019s less likely to interfere with your rightward movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan for Future Turns**\n1. **Prioritize moving toward (9, 3) apple** while avoiding Snake #0\u2019s potential aggression.\n2. **Avoid extending upward** if Snake #0 is likely to move toward you.\n3. **Monitor (7, 6) apple** for future growth opportunities.\n4. **If Snake #0 moves, adjust path to avoid collisions** with its body segments (if it grows).\n5. **On Turn 13**, if Snake #0 hasn\u2019t moved, consider moving toward (9, 3) or (7, 6) if safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Decision**\n**DOWN**\n\n---\nUP",

No immediate risk.\n   - **Follow-up:** From (7,4), next move could be DOWN to (7,5) (safe, but may not align with apples).\n   - **Pros:** Directly toward (7,6) apple.\n   - **Cons:** Snake #0 may move aggressively; no clear long-term advantage.\n\n2. **DOWN (7,6):**\n   - Valid (apple at (7,6)).\n   - **Collision risk:** Snake #0\u2019s head is at (4,8), which is not adjacent to (7,6).

No, but if it moves to (4,7), it may block future paths).\n- LEFT: (4,7) (same as DOWN).\n- RIGHT: (4,9) (safe, but no immediate threat).\n\n**Most aggressive move:** Snake #0 may move DOWN to (4,7) or LEFT to (4,7), which could block your path to (7,6) in the next turn.\n\n---\n\n### **Optimal Move: DOWN**\n**Reasoning:**\n- **Immediate apple gain:** Moving DOWN to (7,6) eats the apple at (7,6) and grows your snake.\n- **Long-term safety:** Even if Snake #0 moves aggressively, your body is at (6,5), so moving DOWN to (7,6) is safe.
