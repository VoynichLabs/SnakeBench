Now that I've collected the previous apple, I need to choose my next target\n2. Looking at distances, (8, 5) is technically closest at Manhattan distance 8\n3. I have clear paths to go down and right toward (8, 5)\n4. Moving LEFT would be dangerous as it gets closer to enemy snake\n5. Moving UP would hit the wall\n6. Moving RIGHT would be moving away from my body and toward the next target\n\nFor next turn:\n- After moving RIGHT, I'll need to plan a path downward to reach (8, 5)\n- Need to be cautious of enemy snake's potential movements\n\nI choose: RIGHT"

Avoid DOWN.\n\nStrategic reassessment of apples:\n- Apple at (4,9) no longer listed, suggesting Snake #2 took it already. It's no longer an available target.\n- Nearest remaining apples are at:\n    - (4,3) reachable downward after careful maneuvering from here (2,8).\n    - (8,5) and (9,4), both far-right positions across the board, might involve interactions or competition with Snake #2 positioned around (4,9),(5,9),(5,8),(6,8).\n    - (1,1) and (2,3) exist below me, manageable but slightly further.\n\nBased on nearest apple analysis, consider carefully choosing the safest path to nearest manageable apple:\n- (4,3) and (2,3) apples are directly downward, and (2,3), in particular, can be reached relatively easily by a straight-down path since we directly align on the x-coordinate already.\n- Given that immediate available apples lie below, I should logically prioritize moving downward in the next few moves, carefully navigating around my own body (currently blocking immediate downward movement) and obstacles.\n\nThus, plan next few strategic moves:\nTo move downward safely toward (2,3), I must first move sideways or up to clear a path around my own body currently occupying (2,7):\n- Move UP to (2,9). Safe move.\n- After moving UP and avoiding potential collision with snake 2 at (4,9), carefully assess moving RIGHT or LEFT next turn.\n- Start planning subsequent moves around my body, possibly RIGHT to (3,9), then downward afterwards to open path toward apple at (2,3).\n\nTherefore, my immediate action this turn will be a safe move UP to (2,9). \n\nStrategy reminder for future moves:\n- Move upward safely now, then carefully sideways and downward route planning to create a safe available path downward towards nearest apples (2,3)/(4,3).\n- Always reassess safety each turn, ensuring not to collide with falling into traps between my own body or enemy snake.\n\nNext Move: UP"
