So, moving left isn't possible in this case.\n\n2. Moving **UP**: Moving up from (1, 7) would place my snake's head at (1, 6). Although this doesn't bring us closer to the apple directly, it does maintain our progress towards the area where the apple resides.\n\n3. Moving **DOWN**: Moving down from (1, 7) would place my snake's head at (2, 7). This is closer to the apple at (2, 9), but we also need to consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy is at (7, 0) and has a body segment at (6, 0). Given their vertical orientation, they pose no immediate threat to our horizontal movement.\n\nConsidering the immediate threat assessment and the proximity to the apple, moving **DOWN** seems the best option as it brings me closer to the apple without any immediate danger.\n\nStrategy reminder: Stay close to where the apple is located and be cautious about the enemy's position, but prioritize reaching the apple to score points.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN",

The tail is at (7, 8), which will move forward in the next turn.\n\nFrom my current position at (8, 9), I can move:\n- Up to (8, 10) - not safe as it's a wall\n- Down to (8, 8) - safe, but it's part of my body\n- Left to (7, 9) - safe\n- Right to (9, 9) - safe, but it's part of my body\n\nThe only safe move is left to (7, 9). Moving left would bring me closer to the apple at (5, 8), which is a good option. The apple at (9, 1) is too far down, and moving down is not safe.\n\nI should focus on moving towards the apple at (5, 8). After moving left to (7, 9), I'll need to move down to (7, 8), then left to (6, 8), and so on until I reach (5, 8).\n\nStrategy for next turns: After moving left, I'll focus on moving down and left towards the apple at (5, 8). I'll need to be careful to avoid my own body and the enemy snake. I'll also keep an eye on the apple at (0, 2) and (0, 3) in case those become better options.\n\nMy next move: LEFT",
