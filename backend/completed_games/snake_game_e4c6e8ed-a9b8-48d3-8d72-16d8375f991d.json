I'd die by backwards collision. \u2717\n- DOWN: (9, 6) - Safe\n- LEFT: (8, 7) - Safe\n- RIGHT: (10, 7) - This is off the board. I'd die. \u2717\n\nSo I can move DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (9, 4) with body at (9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3). They can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- Apples are at (7, 8), (3, 2), (2, 0), and (6, 4).\n\n**LOOKING AT THE BOARD:**\n- My head is at (9, 7). The apple at (7, 8) is at distance 2 (2 steps left, 1 step up).\n- The apple at (6, 4) is at distance \u221a18 (3 steps left, 3 steps down).\n- The apple at (3, 2) is at distance \u221a50 (6 steps left, 5 steps down).\n- The apple at (2, 0) is at distance \u221a74 (7 steps left, 7 steps down).\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- If enemy snake #1 moves UP to (9, 5), we won't collide.\n- If enemy snake #1 moves RIGHT to (10, 4), they'd die by going off the board, so they won't do that.\n- If enemy snake #1 moves LEFT to (8, 4), we won't collide.\n- If enemy snake #1 moves DOWN to (9, 3), we won't collide.\n\n**LOOKING AHEAD:**\n- Moving DOWN to (9, 6) doesn't get me an apple immediately but keeps me away from the enemy snake.\n- Moving LEFT to (8, 7) doesn't get me an apple immediately but brings me closer to the apple at (7, 8).\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- The enemy snake is at (9, 4) with their body extending to the left.\n- They have 6 apples, I have 4 apples.\n- They're likely to move UP or LEFT to get closer to apples.\n\n**IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITY:**\nLooking at the apples, the apple at (7, 8) is 2 steps away (2 steps left, 1 step up), and the apple at (6, 4) is 3 steps away (3 steps left, 3 steps down).\n\n**PLAN:**\nI should move LEFT to (8, 7) to get closer to the apple at (7, 8). This move keeps me away from the enemy snake and gets me closer to an apple.\n\nLEFT",

Its new head will be at (9,6), far from our intended path.\n\n- **Conclusion:** LEFT is safe, advances us toward an apple, and preserves flexibility for the next turns.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nContinue moving LEFT to reach the apple at (6,4). After eating it, head toward the remaining apples (e.g., (3,2) and (2,0)) while staying clear of the enemy\u2019s path.\n\nLEFT",
