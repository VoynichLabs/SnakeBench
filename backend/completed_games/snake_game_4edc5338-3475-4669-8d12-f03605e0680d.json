Since moving upwards would put the snake in the path of the enemy snake, and moving left would cause an immediate collision with the enemy snake's body, these directions are not safe. Moving right would lead to a dead end, as the snake would hit the wall.\n\nThe best move now is to head towards the apple at (6, 4), which is to the left and down from the current position. This move is safe because it avoids the enemy snake and the walls. After collecting the apple at (6, 4), the snake will be in a good position to decide the next move, which could be towards the apple at (4, 5) or (9, 1), depending on the positions of the other snakes and the state of the board at that time.\n\nTherefore, the next move is to position the snake to collect the apple at (6, 4) by moving diagonally down and to the left, which is equivalent to moving down first and then left on the next turn.\n\nNext move: DOWN (to prepare for the diagonal move towards the apple at (6, 4)).\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After moving down this turn, I will move left on the next turn to collect the apple at (6, 4).

To get there, the snake would need to move left and then up. However, moving left immediately would not be wise because it would put the snake in a position to potentially run into the wall.\n\nTherefore, after collecting the apple at (4, 5), the snake should move left to position the snake's head at (3, 5), which would set up the snake to move up towards the apple at (0, 3) on subsequent turns while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake and avoiding the wall.\n\nNext move: UP to collect the apple at (4, 5).\n\nStrategy for the next turn after collecting the apple: Move LEFT to position the snake's head at (3, 5) and then plan to move up towards the apple at (0, 3)."

This means that on the next turn, the enemy snake will likely continue moving down, possibly reaching (6, 2) to (6, 6).\n\nGiven this, moving left to (0, 5) is a safe move for this turn. It keeps us at a safe distance from the enemy snake and away from its trajectory. On the next turn, we should aim to move up towards the apple at (2, 9), but we must ensure that the enemy snake has not moved in a way that would threaten our path.\n\nIf we move left to (0, 5), we will be in a good position to then move up towards (2, 9) on the next turn, provided that the enemy snake does not pose a direct threat.

          "move": "DOWN",
          "rationale": "Given the current board state, we need to consider the positions of the apples, the enemy snake, and our own snake's body to determine the best move. Our goal is to safely collect apples while avoiding collisions.\n\nLooking at the apples, we have several options:\n- We could move towards the apple at (2, 9), but this would require us to navigate around the enemy snake #1, which is currently an obstacle.\n- The apple at (9, 9) is currently unreachable due to our position and the enemy snake's position.\n- The apple at (0, 3) is close, but moving towards it immediately would not be ideal because it would put us in a position where we could potentially be blocked by the enemy snake if it moves towards the apple at (2, 9).\n- The apples at (9, 1) and (0, 0) are distant and not immediately relevant.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake #1 is moving downwards and its head is at (3, 4), it is unlikely to be a threat to us on our next move. However, we should be cautious not to get too close to its path.\n\nWe are currently at (0, 8) with the body segment at (0, 7). Moving up to (0, 6) as suggested by the last move rationale is safe and keeps us close to the wall, which is a strategic advantage. However, we should also consider the possibility of collecting an apple on this turn.\n\nThe closest apple is at (0, 3), and we can safely move towards it without risking a collision with the enemy snake. By moving down to (0, 7), we avoid any immediate danger and position ourselves to collect the apple at (0, 3) on the subsequent turn. This move also keeps us on the left edge of the board, which gives us fewer directions to worry about and allows us to focus on vertical movement.\n\nTherefore, the decided next move is: DOWN to position (0, 7). On the next turn, we should reassess the enemy snake's position and, if it is safe, continue moving down towards the apple at (0, 3).\n\nNext move: DOWN"
