This is less optimal due to longer travel time and exposure to enemy.\n2. **Safety**:\n\t- The enemy snake's head at **(4, 3)** blocks the immediate path to **(6, 3)**. Moving **UP \u2192 UP \u2192 LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 DOWN** could work to circle around safely.\n3. **Avoiding Risky Moves**:\n\t- Moving **DOWN**: The enemy snake is nearby, and it creates future trap risks.\n\t- Moving **LEFT**: Puts me in a corner, with limited escape options.\n\t- Moving **RIGHT**: Hits a wall.\n\n#### Decision:\n\nTo secure an apple and avoid risks, I'll aim for **(6, 3)** by moving **UP \u2192 UP \u2192 LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 DOWN**. This ensures a steady gain while keeping the enemy snake at bay.\n\n**Next Move**: **UP**\n\n- **Strategy Next Turn**: Reassess whether **(6, 3)** is still the safest apple or if an alternative path opens up.",
