The alternative (going up for the stack first) takes 9 moves to clear the same apples.\n- **Enemy Status:** The enemy snake is at (7, 2). They are likely targeting the apple at (9, 4).\n- **Safety:** Moving RIGHT to (7, 5) places me on the same X-coordinate as the enemy, but with a vertical separation of 3 squares. Since the enemy cannot jump 3 squares in one turn, there is no collision risk. I am significantly faster to the target apple at (9, 5) than the enemy is (distance 3 vs distance 5).\n\n**Strategy:**\nContinue moving East to claim the apple at (9, 5). After consuming it, I will turn North to sweep the remaining apples.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (7, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (9, 5) is 4 moves away (RIGHT x4). The enemy at (6, 2) is 6 moves away from (9, 5). I have a clear speed advantage to secure (9, 5). The enemy is closer to (9, 4) and will likely target it.\n- **Safety**: Moving RIGHT to (6, 5) keeps me on row $y=5$. The enemy is at $y=2$. Even if the enemy moves UP immediately to intercept, they cannot reach row $y=5$ before I have passed $x=6$ and $x=7$. Therefore, the path is safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI will proceed RIGHT to maintain the most direct line to (9, 5). My plan is to \"sweep\" the apples from bottom to top: grab (9, 5), then curve up and left to consume the vertical stack at $x=8$.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (6, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

An apple exists at (7, 3), directly adjacent to them. It is highly probable the enemy will move DOWN to consume that apple.

My tail is effectively at (8, 5) but will move to (9, 5) (conceptually shrinking) as I move, unless I ate, but I just ate so length is 6. The tail arithmetic is handled by the engine; important part is (8, 5) becomes free or stays as tail tip, but the squares North and West of me are clear.\n2.  **Immediate Objective:** The closest and most strategic apple is at (3, 9). This apple is located on the top row.\n3.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP (8, 9):** Valid move. Moves to the top border. Aligns my Y-coordinate with the target apple at (3, 9). This creates a very simple path (West along the top edge) to secure the apple. It also maximizes the distance from the enemy snake, whose head is at (7, 3) (row 3), ensuring safety.\n    *   **LEFT (7, 8):** Valid move. Also moves towards the apple but keeps me on row 8. While safe, moving to row 9 now \"cleans up\" the top edge and leaves row 8 available for maneuvering later if necessary.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 8):** Moves into a corner/dead-end side.

Specifically, apple (9, 5) is perfectly aligned with my current row (y=5), and the cluster at (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8) is just above that.\n\n**Distance Calculation:**\n- To apple (9, 5): Straight RIGHT.

Upon reaching (8, 5), I can choose to go East to (9, 5) or North to (8, 6) depending on the enemy's position.\n3.  **Scoring Potential**: The \"Right\" path allows me to eat (9, 5), then move to (9, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 8), effectively sweeping 4 apples. If I go UP first, I likely secure the (8, 6)-(8, 8) cluster but might lose (9, 5) to the enemy after they eat (9, 4).\n4.  **Safety**: The square (4, 5) is empty.

Specifically, apple (9, 5) is perfectly aligned with my current row (y=5), and the cluster at (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8) is just above that.\n\n**Distance Calculation:**\n- To apple (9, 5): Straight RIGHT.

My tail is effectively at (8, 5) but will move to (9, 5) (conceptually shrinking) as I move, unless I ate, but I just ate so length is 6. The tail arithmetic is handled by the engine; important part is (8, 5) becomes free or stays as tail tip, but the squares North and West of me are clear.\n2.  **Immediate Objective:** The closest and most strategic apple is at (3, 9). This apple is located on the top row.\n3.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP (8, 9):** Valid move. Moves to the top border. Aligns my Y-coordinate with the target apple at (3, 9). This creates a very simple path (West along the top edge) to secure the apple. It also maximizes the distance from the enemy snake, whose head is at (7, 3) (row 3), ensuring safety.\n    *   **LEFT (7, 8):** Valid move. Also moves towards the apple but keeps me on row 8. While safe, moving to row 9 now \"cleans up\" the top edge and leaves row 8 available for maneuvering later if necessary.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 8):** Moves into a corner/dead-end side.

It ensures no space is wasted behind the head. It positions me to move DOWN along the far-left wall (Column 0). This is the safest lane because it is an edge; I only have to worry about threats from the right. It also routes me directly into the apple at (0, 6).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Moving LEFT adheres to the strategy of hugging the perimeter. It clears the corner, avoids immediate alignment with the enemy in Column 1, and sets up a clean path to the apples.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nFrom the corner (0, 9), pivot DOWN to traverse Column 0, aiming for the apple at (0, 6).\n\nLEFT",

There is a second apple adjacent to it at (1, 6). Going RIGHT would take a longer path to reach these food sources.\n3.  **Enemy Predictability:** The enemy snake's head is at (0, 0). Crucially, its body occupies the row directly above it from (0, 1) to (4, 1). This geometry physically traps the enemy against the bottom wall and the left wall, strictly forcing it to move **RIGHT** along the bottom row (y=0) for the next several turns until it passes its own tail. This guarantees that the enemy cannot move UP into my path along column 0.\n4.  **Tactics:** Moving DOWN allows me to hug the left wall, keeping the center of the board open, and efficiently reach the cluster of apples.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move DOWN is safe, efficient, and leads directly to points. The enemy is incapable of interfering.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nMove DOWN to (0, 6) to consume the apple. Immediately after, plan to turn RIGHT to (1, 6) to consume the second apple, maximizing growth in a confined area before moving toward the center.\n\nDOWN",

I will likely get 4 apples while the enemy gets only 1.\n-   **Safety:** The square (9, 5) is currently unoccupied and within bounds. The enemy cannot reach (9, 5) this turn (distance is 3 cells).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nIdentify that after eating the apple at (9, 5), the square (9, 4) will likely be contested by the enemy. To avoid a collision, move UP to (9, 6). This seals the northern section of the board for myself and forces the enemy to retreat to the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (9, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

It keeps my body compact against the left wall.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 7): This moves me away from the immediate apple cluster.

From (1, 6), the board opens up to the right and down, providing ample escape routes.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nMy plan is to grab the apple at (0, 6) now.

An apple exists at (7, 3), directly adjacent to them. It is highly probable the enemy will move DOWN to consume that apple.

I must take the apple at (2, 4) before the enemy can get closer.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nScore the apple at (2, 4) to reach length 10. Anticipate the enemy moving to (3, 3). On the following turn, evaluate if the path to the apple at (2, 1) via (2, 3) is safe from collision; if the enemy looks aggressive, detour through (1, 4) or (3, 4) to stay alive while maintaining board control.\n\nDOWN",

It keeps my body compact against the left wall.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 7): This moves me away from the immediate apple cluster. While safe, it is less points-efficient.\n5.  **Future Safety:** After moving DOWN to (0, 6), my next move will almost certainly be RIGHT to (1, 6) to eat the second apple. From (1, 6), the board opens up to the right and down, providing ample escape routes.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nMy plan is to grab the apple at (0, 6) now. On the next turn, I will move **RIGHT** to (1, 6) to catch the second adjacent apple, maximizing my score while remaining safe in the empty middle left region of the board.\n\nDOWN",
