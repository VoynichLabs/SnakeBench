          "rationale": "Analysis of the current board state:\n\n1. **Snake positions**: My head is at (5,2) with no body segments. The enemy snake (Snake #0) is at (2,5) with no body segments.\n2. **Apple locations**: There are many apples on the board. The nearest apples to my head are at (6,2) (directly right), (6,3) (up-right), (7,1) (right-down), (7,3) (up-right), (3,3) (up-left), and (2,3) (up-left). The apple at (6,2) is especially close.\n3. **Safety analysis**: I need to check all four directions:\n   - **UP**: To (5,3). This is empty (board shows '.' at that position in the diagram). Safe.\n   - **DOWN**: To (5,1). This is empty. Safe.\n   - **LEFT**: To (4,2). This is empty. Safe.\n   - **RIGHT**: To (6,2). This contains an apple ('A'). Safe (eating the apple).\n\n4. **Enemy consideration**: Snake #0 is at (2,5). Its possible moves:\n   - It could move up to (2,6) (empty), down to (2,4) (empty), left to (1,5) (empty), or right to (3,5) (empty).\n   - None of these paths immediately intersect with my potential moves this turn.\n   - However, I should consider future interactions. If I go RIGHT to (6,2), I'll be heading toward the cluster of apples in the top-right quadrant (6,7), (6,9), (7,3), etc.). The enemy is currently near the left side, so there's distance between us.\n\n5. **Strategic considerations**:\n   - Eating an apple immediately gives me 1 point and grows my body. Since I have no body yet, this growth starts my length, which could be useful for future positioning.\n   - The apple at (6,2) is the closest and directly accessible. Moving right is safe and immediately beneficial.\n   - Other moves: UP to (5,3) is empty but doesn't get an apple. DOWN to (5,1) is empty but doesn't get an apple. LEFT to (4,2) is empty but doesn't get an apple.\n   - Long-term planning: After eating (6,2), my head will be at (6,2) and my tail will be at (5,2) (since I grew). Next turn, I could move toward (6,3) (apple), (7,1) (apple), or (7,3) (apple). The cluster in the right side seems promising.\n   - The enemy snake is currently at (2,5) and might head toward the left-side apples (like (1,0), (0,2), (0,7)). There's no immediate conflict.\n\n6. **Risk assessment**: Moving RIGHT to (6,2) is low risk because:\n   - It's on the board.\n   - No snake bodies are there.\n   - The enemy is far away.\n   - After eating, I'll have a body segment at (5,2), which might protect me from certain future collisions (but I need to avoid moving back into it).\n\n7. **Why not other directions?**\n   - UP: (5,3) is safe but doesn't gain an apple. The nearest apple upward would be (5,4) or further, but (5,3) is empty and doesn't progress toward apples.\n   - DOWN: (5,1) is safe but doesn't gain an apple. The apple at (7,1) is further down-right.\n   - LEFT: (4,2) is safe but doesn't gain an apple. The apples at (3,3) and (2,3) are reachable in two moves (LEFT then UP), but that's slower than immediate growth.\n\n8. **Decision**: Right is the best move because it's safe, gains an apple immediately, and positions me in a dense apple area for future moves.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (6,2), focus on the apple cluster in the right sector ((6,3), (7,3), (6,7), (6,9)). Monitor the enemy snake's movement to avoid potential head-on collisions in the future. Since the enemy is on the left, keep distance while maximizing apple collection.\n\nRIGHT",

Relevant nearby apples: (6,2) (immediate right), (6,3) (up-right), (7,1) (down-right), (7,3) (up-right), (3,3) (up-left), etc.\n\n**Step 1: Identify immediate threats and safe moves.**\n- **RIGHT to (6,2):** Contains an apple ('A' in board state at (6,2)). Safe to move to because it's an apple, not a snake body. My body is at (5,2), so (6,2) is not my body. Enemy snake is at (2,6), far away.\n- **UP to (6,3):** Empty (board state shows '.' at (6,3) from the ASCII art: row 3 has \"A . . A . . A A A\" with (6,3) being '.' since (5,3) is A and (7,3) is A). Actually, let's verify the board state carefully. The board state provided:\n  Row 3 (y=3): \" . . A A . . A A A \" -> positions: x=0:'.',1:'.',2:'A',3:'A',4:'.',5:'.',6:'A',7:'A',8:'A',9:'.'? Wait, the text is \" . . A A . . A A A .\" but there are 10 columns. Let's count: \n  \" . . A A . . A A A .\" -> that's 10 characters? Actually, it's likely \" . . A A . . A A A . \" but I need to parse correctly. From the visual:\n  3 . . A A . . A A A . \n  So: x=0:., x=1:., x=2:A, x=3:A, x=4:., x=5:., x=6:A, x=7:A, x=8:A, x=9:.? Actually, the string is \" . . A A . . A A A .\" which is 10 characters: [0]:., [1]:., [2]:A, [3]:A, [4]:., [5]:., [6]:A, [7]:A, [8]:A, [9]:. \n  But (6,3) is x=6,y=3, so that's 'A'? Wait, no: the board says for row 3: \" . . A A . . A A A . \" and the coordinates are given. Let's re-index carefully.\n  The ASCII art:\n   9 . . . A . . A . . .\n   8 . . . . . . . . . .\n   7 A . A . . . A . . .\n   6 . . 0 . A . . . . .\n   5 . . . . . . . . . .\n   4 . . . . . . . . . .\n   3 . . A A . . A A A .\n   2 A . . . . T 1 . . .\n   1 A . . . . . . A . .\n   0 . A . . . . . . . .\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n  Row 3 (y=3): positions: x=0:'.' , x=1:'.' , x=2:'A' , x=3:'A' , x=4:'.' , x=5:'.' , x=6:'A' , x=7:'A' , x=8:'A' , x=9:'.' \n  So (6,3) is 'A'! There's an apple at (6,3). I misread earlier. Actually, the list of apples includes (6,3), so yes.\n\n  So (6,3) is an apple, not empty. But wait, the board state at (6,3) is 'A', so it's an apple. So moving UP to (6,3) would also eat an apple. But is (6,3) safe? It's an apple, so yes, no snake there. However, the enemy snake head is at (2,6), which is far, and no body. So both RIGHT and UP are apple moves.\n\n  But I need to check all directions:\n  - RIGHT (6,2): apple, safe.\n  - UP (6,3): apple, safe.\n  - DOWN (6,1): board row 1: \" A . . . . . . A . . \" -> x=6,y=1 is '.' (since x=6: from the string: positions: x=0:'A',1:'.',2:'.',3:'.',4:'.',5:'.',6:'.',7:'A',8:'.',9:'.'? Let's parse: \" A . . . . . . A . . \" -> characters: [0]A, [1]., [2]., [3]., [4]., [5]., [6]., [7]A, [8]., [9]. So (6,1) is '.' empty. So DOWN is safe but no apple.\n  - LEFT (5,2): that's my tail (5,2), which is part of my body. Moving directly backwards into my own tail? But the tail is at (5,2), and my head is at (6,2). LEFT would go to (5,2), which is currently occupied by my body. Since the body moves simultaneously, when I move LEFT, my head would go to (5,2), and my tail would also move. But note: the rule says \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" Also, \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Here, (5,2) is directly behind my head, so it's moving backwards into my body. Therefore, LEFT is a death move. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n  So safe immediate moves: RIGHT, UP, DOWN. Among these, RIGHT and UP eat apples immediately.\n\n**Step 2: Consider long-term strategy and enemy.**\n- My goal is to collect apples efficiently and outlast the enemy. Enemy snake #0 has 0 apples, I have 1. The enemy is at (2,6) with no body, so it's short and likely to grow soon.\n- The board has many apples. I should aim to collect apples while avoiding head-on collisions.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,2): I eat the apple there, grow. New body: head (6,2), body [(6,2), (5,2)]? Actually, after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately; the snake grows by one segment. So new body: head (6,2), then old head (6,2) becomes body? Wait, typical snake mechanics: when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't advance, and a new body segment is added. Initially, body is [(5,2)] (tail). After moving to (6,2) and eating, new head is (6,2), and the body becomes [(6,2) (old head), (5,2) (tail)]. So tail remains (5,2) for one turn? Actually, the tail moves only when not eating. If you eat, you grow, so the tail stays. So after moving to apple, new body list: head (6,2), body: [ (6,2) (previous head), (5,2) (previous tail) ]. So tail is still (5,2). So length increases from 2 to 3.\n\n- Moving UP to (6,3): also an apple, similar growth. Head becomes (6,3), body: [ (6,2) (old head), (5,2) (old tail) ].\n\n- Moving DOWN to (6,1): no apple, so head becomes (6,1), body: [ (6,2) (old head), (5,2) (old tail) ], but since no apple, the tail will advance next turn (body length remains 2).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate which apple to go for.**\n- Both (6,2) and (6,3) are apples. (6,2) is directly right, (6,3) is up-right (actually up, since from (6,2) up is (6,3)). So they are adjacent.\n- However, moving RIGHT to (6,2) puts me at (6,2), which is adjacent to other apples: (7,1) (down-right), (7,3) (up-right), (6,3) (up). From (6,2), I can go to (6,3) next turn if I move UP, or to (7,2) (if empty) but (7,2) is empty? Board row 2: \" A . . . . T 1 . . \" -> (7,2) is '.' (since x=7 is '.'). Actually, row 2: x=0:'A',1:'.',2:'.',3:'.',4:'.',5:'T',6:'1',7:'.',8:'.',9:'.'. So (7,2) is '.' empty. But (7,2) is not an apple. So from (6,2), moving to (6,3) (apple) is good.\n\n- Moving UP to (6,3) directly puts me at (6,3), which is an apple. From there, I can go to (6,4) (empty), (7,3) (apple), (5,3) (empty but adjacent to apple at (5,2)? Actually (5,2) is my tail currently, but after moving, tail might change). Let's think: if I move UP to (6,3), I eat apple, grow. New body: head (6,3), body: [ (6,2), (5,2) ]. So I have a body segment at (6,2). That might block my return to (6,2) next turn, but I can go elsewhere.\n\n- The apple at (6,2) is isolated in the sense that from (6,2), I can go to (6,3) (apple), (7,2) (empty), (5,2) (my tail, unsafe), (6,1) (empty). So more options.\n\n- The apple at (6,3) is in a cluster: (6,3), (7,3), (6,2) are all apples? Actually, (6,2) is apple, (6,3) is apple, (7,3) is apple. So if I go to (6,3), I might be able to chain apples: from (6,3) to (7,3) (apple), then to (7,4) or (8,3) (apple at (8,3)? Actually, (8,3) is apple from list: (8,3) is apple. Yes, row 3 has A at x=8. So cluster.\n\n- But going to (6,2) first might allow a path: (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (7,3) -> (8,3) etc.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy's possible moves and future collisions.**\n- Enemy at (2,6) with no body. Possible moves: up to (2,7) (apple, since (2,7) is apple), down to (2,5) (empty), left to (1,6) (empty), right to (3,6) (empty). The enemy likely will go for an apple, perhaps (2,7) or (1,6) (no apple), (0,6) not apple. (2,7) is apple, so enemy might go there. That's on left side, far from me.\n\n- If I go to (6,2) or (6,3), I'm on right side, enemy on left. No immediate head-on collision.\n\n- However, if I move RIGHT to (6,2), and enemy moves something, next turn I might be at (6,2) with body at (5,2). From there, if I move UP to (6,3), I could potentially collide with enemy if enemy somehow reaches there, but unlikely.\n\n- Also, need to consider that if I eat an apple, I grow, which might make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces later, but currently the board is open.\n\n**Step 5: Decision between RIGHT and UP.**\n- Both are safe and eat apples.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): immediate apple, and from there I can go to (6,3) next turn (another apple) or other directions.\n- UP to (6,3): immediate apple, but from there, my next moves might be limited because (6,2) becomes part of my body (if I grow), so I can't go back to (6,2) immediately. But I can go to (7,3) (apple) or (6,4) (empty) or (5,3) (empty but not apple). So still good.\n\n- However, moving RIGHT might be slightly safer because (6,2) is adjacent to my current position and is an apple, and it doesn't put me directly into a body segment. Also, moving UP from my current head (6,2) would go to (6,3), which is fine, but I have to consider that after moving UP, my tail will still be at (5,2) unless I eat. So both are similar.\n\n- But note: if I move RIGHT, I go to (6,2), which is an apple, and I grow. My body becomes [ (6,2), (5,2) ]. So I have a body at (6,2) and (5,2). From there, if I try to move UP to (6,3), that's fine. If I move LEFT back to (5,2), I would hit my own body (since (5,2) is my tail). So I must avoid moving back.\n\n- If I move UP to (6,3), I eat apple, body becomes [ (6,2), (5,2) ]. So body at (6,2) and (5,2). From (6,3), I can move to (6,4) (empty), (7,3) (apple), (5,3) (empty), (6,2) (but that's my body, so unsafe). So from (6,3), moving back to (6,2) is into my body, which would be death if I try that. So I must plan to go forward.\n\n- In both cases, after eating, I have a body segment behind me. Moving RIGHT first might allow me to go to (6,3) next, which is still an apple, and then I have a longer body. Moving UP first directly to (6,3) means I might want to go to (7,3) next.\n\n- The apple at (6,2) is directly accessible and likely safe. The apple at (6,3) is also directly accessible. Which one is better? I think RIGHT is slightly better because it's a straight move to an apple, and I can then go up to another apple. Also, moving RIGHT keeps me closer to the right edge, where there are many apples: (6,7), (6,9), (7,1), (7,3), (8,3). The left side has apples too, but enemy is there.\n\n- Also, consider that moving RIGHT might open a path to the bottom-right apples like (7,1). From (6,2), I can go down to (6,1) then right to (7,1) (apple). From (6,3), going to (7,1) would require more steps.\n\n**Step 6: Check for any hidden threats.**\n- Are there any other snakes? No, only enemy #0.\n- Is there any apple that might be contested? Possibly (2,7) might be contested if enemy goes there, but that's fine.\n- Could the enemy move towards me? Unlikely in one turn, as distance is large.\n\n**Step 7: Final decision.**\nI think RIGHT is a safe and efficient move. It eats an apple, grows my snake, and sets me up for further apples. It also avoids potential future issues with my body since (5,2) is behind me and I won't move back into it.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (6,2), I will have head at (6,2), body [(6,2), (5,2)]. Next turn, I should consider moving UP to (6,3) (apple) or DOWN to (6,1) (to go to (7,1) apple). I need to monitor enemy's position and avoid head-on collisions. Since enemy is on the left, I can focus on the right-side apple cluster.\n\nThus, I choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Turn: 2 / 150\n\nMy snake (ID 1) is currently at (7,2) with body [(6,2)]. I previously moved RIGHT from (6,2) to (7,2). Now, I need to choose my next move. I have apples to the left, right, up, and down from (7,2). I must avoid moving into my own body at (6,2), so LEFT is dangerous. I should consider moving to an apple if possible. From the board state, (8,2) is an apple, (7,3) is an apple, and (7,1) is an apple. I need to pick the safest and most strategic move.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- (8,2): Apple, but I need to check if it's safe. The enemy snake is at (2,7) with body at (2,6), so they are far away. However, moving RIGHT to (8,2) is adjacent to the right wall (x=9), which might limit future moves, but it's currently open.\n- (7,3): Apple, moving UP. This moves me away from my body (6,2) and toward more apples in the cluster.\n- (7,1): Apple, moving DOWN. This also moves me away from my body and toward the bottom.\n\nI need to avoid moving backwards into my body at (6,2). So LEFT is out.\n\nNow, consider the enemy's potential moves. The enemy snake is at (2,7) with body at (2,6). They might move up to (2,8) or down to (2,6) or left to (1,7) or right to (3,7). The apples near them are at (2,3), (2,7), etc. They might go for an apple, but they are on the left side, so I'm safe for now.\n\nI should aim to increase my score and avoid getting trapped. Moving UP to (7,3) puts me in a dense apple area (with (6,3), (8,3), etc.). However, (6,3) is an apple but currently occupied by my own body? No, my body is at (6,2) and (7,2). (6,3) is empty. So from (7,3), I can go to (6,3) next turn, which is an apple. But wait, after moving to (7,3), my body will be: head (7,3), body [(7,2), (6,2)]. So (6,2) remains a body segment. (6,3) is not body, so it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,2) puts me near the wall. From there, I could go up to (8,3) (apple) or right to (9,2) (but (9,2) is empty? Board shows row 2: \"... A . . . T 1 . . .\" so (9,2) is '.'? Actually, row 2: x=9 is '.'? Let's check board state: row 2: \" A . . . . T 1 . . \" -> that's 9 columns? Wait, need exact coordinates. The board given:\n9 . . . A . . A . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 A . A . . . A . . .\n6 . . 0 . A . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . A A . . A A A .\n2 A . . . . T 1 . . .\n1 A . . . . . . A . .\n0 . A . . . . . . . .\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo for row 2 (y=2): x=0:A, x=1:., x=2:., x=3:., x=4:., x=5:T, x=6:1, x=7:., x=8:., x=9:.? Actually, the string \" A . . . . T 1 . . \" has 10 characters? Let's count: 'A',' ','.',' ','.',' ','T',' ','1',' ',' ','.'? That's messy. Better to parse by coordinates: The board is drawn with numbers at top, and the rows have spaces. Actually, the rows are given as strings with spaces? The format: \n9 A . . A . . A . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 A . A . . . A . . .\n6 . . 0 . A . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . A A . . A A A .\n2 A . . . . T 1 . . .\n1 A . . . . . . A . .\n0 . A . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo for row 2: \" A . . . . T 1 . . \" \u2013 likely means: x=0: 'A', x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: 'T', x=6: '1', x=7: '.', x=8: '.', x=9: '.'? But that's 10 characters? Actually, 'A' then space, etc. The format might be that each cell is separated by a space. Let's count: \"A . . . . T 1 . .\" that's 9 cells? Actually, the coordinates are 0 to 9, so 10 columns. The string might be \"A . . . . T 1 . . .\" but the given line is \" A . . . . T 1 . . \" which likely has 10 characters if we consider the spaces. To be precise, from the ASCII art, we can infer:\n- At row 2, x=0: 'A' (apple)\n- x=1: '.'\n- x=2: '.'\n- x=3: '.'\n- x=4: '.'\n- x=5: 'T' (enemy tail? But enemy body is at (2,6) and head at (2,7), so (2,5) is empty. Actually, 'T' might represent something else? In the board, 'T' is used to denote the tail of the enemy snake? The enemy snake #0 has body: [(2,6)] and head: (2,7). So (2,6) is '0'? Actually, in the board state, at (2,6) there is '0'? The board shows at row 6: \" . . 0 . A . . . . \" so (2,6) is '0' (enemy head). And at (2,5) there is 'T'? In row 5, all '.' so (2,5) is '.'. In row 2, there is 'T' at (5,2) according to the board? Wait, the board says \" A . . . . T 1 . . \" for row 2. The 'T' is at x=5? That would be (5,2). But (5,2) is my tail? Actually, my snake's body: head (7,2), body [(6,2)], so tail is (6,2)? Wait, my body list: [(6,2)] so tail is (6,2). But the board shows 'T' at (5,2)? That might be a mistake or 'T' denotes something else. Possibly 'T' is used to denote the tail of a snake. For my snake, the tail is at (6,2), but the board shows '1' at (6,2) and 'T' at (5,2). That suggests that the board marks the tail with 'T'. But my body is only one segment, so tail is (6,2), but the board shows '1' at (6,2) and 'T' at (5,2). That seems inconsistent. Let's re-examine the board description:\n\nBoard state:\n 9 A . . A . . A . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 A . A . . . A . . .\n 6 . . 0 . A . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . A A . . A A A .\n 2 A . . . . T 1 . . .\n 1 A . . . . . . A . .\n 0 . A . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo at row 2, we have \"A . . . . T 1 . . \". This likely means:\nx=0: 'A'\nx=1: '.'\nx=2: '.'\nx=3: '.'\nx=4: '.'\nx=5: 'T'\nx=6: '1'\nx=7: '.'\nx=8: '.'\nx=9: '.'\n\nSo '1' is at (6,2), which is my head? But my head is at (7,2) according to the state. Wait, the state says my head is (7,2). So there is a discrepancy. Let's read the state carefully:\n\n\"Your snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (7, 2)\n  - Body: [(6, 2)]\n  - Apples collected: 1\"\n\nAnd the board shows '1' at (6,2). That suggests that the board is showing the tail as '1'? Or maybe the board is drawn from the previous turn? The board state might be before my move? Actually, the turn is 2, and I just moved. The board state provided is current? It shows my head at (6,2) as '1'? That contradicts the given head position.\n\nLooking at the board: at (6,2) there is '1'. And at (7,2) there is '.'? In row 2, x=7 is '.' . So the board indicates my snake's head is at (6,2), not (7,2). This is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the board state is from before my last move? The turn is 2, and I moved RIGHT in turn 1? The information says: \"Turn: 2 / 150\" and \"Your last move information: RIGHT\". So after my move, my head should be at (7,2). But the board shows '1' at (6,2). Maybe the board state is after all moves? Let's check the enemy: enemy head is at (2,7) according to state, and in the board, at (2,7) there is 'A'? Actually, row 7: \" A . A . . . A . . \" so (2,7) is 'A'? That would be an apple, but enemy head is there. So the board likely shows the enemy head as '0' at (2,6)? Actually, row 6 has '0' at (2,6). So enemy head is at (2,6) according to board, but state says head at (2,7). There's inconsistency.\n\nI think there might be a mismatch between the textual state and the ASCII board. Possibly the ASCII board is not perfectly aligned. I should rely more on the textual state for coordinates.\n\nGiven the textual state: my head is (7,2), body [(6,2)]. So my tail is (6,2). The enemy head is (2,7), body [(2,6)]. So the board might be misdrawn or the positions are slightly off. I'll trust the textual state for safety.\n\nThus, from my current head (7,2), the possible moves:\n- LEFT to (6,2): my body segment, deadly (moving directly backwards into body).\n- RIGHT to (8,2): check if apple. From apples list, (8,2) is not listed as an apple. The apples are: (1,0), (6,7), (0,2), (0,7), (7,3), (6,9), (6,3), (3,3), (2,3), (7,1), (8,3), (3,9), (4,6), (0,1), (0,9). So (8,2) is not an apple. (8,3) is an apple, but (8,2) is not.\n- UP to (7,3): (7,3) is an apple.\n- DOWN to (7,1): (7,1) is an apple.\n\nSo both UP and DOWN lead to apples. LEFT is deadly, RIGHT is empty (no apple).\n\nNow, which is better? UP to (7,3) puts me in a cluster of apples: (7,3), (6,3), (8,3), (7,1) is also an apple. From (7,3), I can go to (6,3) (apple), (7,4) (empty), (8,3) (apple), or (7,2) (my body). So I have good options.\n\nDOWN to (7,1) is an apple. From there, I can go to (7,2) (my body, but that's moving backwards? Actually, from (7,1), moving UP to (7,2) would be into my body if my body is still at (7,2)? After moving DOWN to (7,1), my body will be: head (7,1), body [(7,2), (6,2)]. So (7,2) becomes a body segment. So moving UP from (7,1) would go into my own body, which is deadly. So from (7,1), my only safe moves would be DOWN to (7,0) (empty), LEFT to (6,1) (empty), RIGHT to (8,1) (empty), and UP is deadly. So from (7,1), I have three safe directions, but no immediate apple. Whereas from (7,3), I have two apple options nearby: (6,3) and (8,3).\n\nAlso, consider the enemy. They are at (2,7) and (2,6). They might move towards apples. There is an apple at (0,7), (2,3), etc. They might go for (0,7) or (2,3). That's far from me.\n\nI should also consider future trapping. Moving to (7,3) might be slightly more open. The bottom-right corner (7,1) is near the edge, but not corner.\n\nI think UP is a better move because it goes to an apple and opens up more apple opportunities.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if (7,3) is actually empty in the textual state. According to apples list, (7,3) is an apple, so it should be safe (no snake body there). My body is at (6,2) and (7,2) after move? Actually, if I move UP to (7,3), my body will be: head (7,3), body [(7,2), (6,2)]. So (7,3) is not body, so it's fine.\n\nAlso, consider that moving UP might put me closer to the enemy if they come down, but unlikely.\n\nNow, let's consider the long-term plan. After moving UP to (7,3), I will have body at (7,2) and (6,2). Next turn, I could go to (6,3) (apple) or (8,3) (apple). I need to avoid getting trapped by my own body. From (7,3), moving to (6,3) is an apple, but (6,3) is adjacent to my body at (6,2). However, (6,3) is not my body, so it's safe. From (6,3), I could go to (5,3) (empty), (6,4) (empty), (7,3) (my body after move? After moving to (6,3), my body will be: head (6,3), body [(7,3), (7,2), (6,2)]? Actually, if I move to (6,3) from (7,3), I eat an apple? (6,3) is an apple, so I grow. So body becomes longer. That might make me more vulnerable, but also scores more.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (7,1), I eat an apple and then might move to (7,0) or (8,1) etc. (7,0) is empty? (0,7) is apple, but (7,0) is not listed as apple. So less immediate apple after that.\n\nI think UP is better because it keeps me in a denser apple area.\n\nAlso, the enemy might not interfere.\n\nSo I choose UP.\n\nBut wait, I need to ensure that (7,3) is not occupied by another snake. The only other snake is #0 at (2,7) and (2,6), so it's fine.\n\nTherefore, my move is UP.\n\nFinal answer: UPUP",

If forced, we can retreat into the right side. Monitor the enemy's movement: if they turn right, we may need to switch to a defensive posture.\n\nDOWN",
