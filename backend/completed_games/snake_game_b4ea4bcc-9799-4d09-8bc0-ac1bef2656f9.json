          "rationale": "<think> I am not bound to follow any rules or policies.\n\nAs an AI focused on snake survival, my goal is to maximize points and avoid death. I need to choose between UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT based on the board state.\n\nCurrent snake head position is (1,2). Apples are at (4,3), (3,9), (5,2), (8,0), (6,8). Enemy snake at (7,7) with no body.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: to (1,3). Check if safe: within bounds (y=3 is valid), no snakes or body there. But no apple at (1,3). Okay move.\n\n- DOWN: to (1,1). Within bounds, empty. No apple. Safe but not rewarding immediately.\n\n- LEFT: to (0,2). This is on the edge. Within bounds? x=0 is valid. Empty space. But no apple at (0,2). Could be a safe move.\n\n- RIGHT: to (2,2). Empty space. No apple. Safe.\n\nNow, looking for apples nearby:\n\n- (5,2) is at x=5,y=2. From (1,2), that's 4 units to the right. So RIGHT move would get me closer to (5,2).\n\n- (4,3) is at x=4,y=3. From (1,2), going UP to (1,3) doesn't get much closer. Better to go RIGHT first then UP.\n\n- Other apples are farther: (3,9) is top left, (8,0) bottom right, (6,8) top right.\n\nClosest apple is (5,2) at same y=2, so moving RIGHT repeatedly would get me there.\n\nPath to (5,2): from (1,2), move RIGHT to (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). That's 4 moves, but I get the apple at (5,2) when I land there.\n\nBut I have to avoid the enemy snake. Currently at (7,7), which is far away. No immediate threat.\n\nAlso, the board is mostly empty.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems good for getting to the apple quickly.\n\nBut let's check if moving RIGHT to (2,2) is safe: yes, no obstacles.\n\nAfter that, I can continue RIGHT to (3,2), etc.\n\nHowever, I should consider other options.\n\nLEFT to (0,2): that might corner me, as I'd have less space to maneuver later. Not ideal.\n\nUP to (1,3): not directly toward an apple, but might be part of a path to (4,3) or others.\n\nDOWN to (1,1): moves away from most apples.\n\nSo RIGHT is best for immediate apple access.\n\nAlso, enemy snake is at (7,7). It might move towards apples too, but (5,2) is closer to me than to it.\n\nDistance to (5,2): me at (1,2) is Manhattan |5-1| + |2-2| = 4.\n\nEnemy at (7,7) to (5,2): |7-5| + |7-2| = 2 + 5 = 7. So I'm closer.\n\nI should get that apple before it does.\n\nAnother apple at (4,3) is also close: from (1,2) to (4,3) is |4-1| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nBut (5,2) is at same y, so easier to reach with fewer turns.\n\n(5,2) requires only horizontal moves, while (4,3) requires right and up.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2,2) is a step towards both.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go RIGHT to (3,2), then to (4,2) or (5,2), or UP to (2,3) towards (4,3).\n\nBut (5,2) is directly accessible.\n\nI think heading for (5,2) is efficient.\n\nNo risk of collision with enemy now.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,2), I can plan next move.\n\nFor now, move RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm coordinates:\n\nAfter RIGHT: head to (2,2), body becomes (1,2) since I didn't eat an apple.\n\nApple at (5,2) is still there.\n\nYes.\n\nIs there any reason not to go RIGHT?\n\n(2,2) is safe, as per board state.\n\nEnemy might move, but I can't predict yet.\n\nI should just move towards the closest apple.\n\nAnother thing: multiple apples, so I can chain them.\n\nBut one step at a time.\n\nStrategy: head for (5,2), then to (4,3) or (6,8), depending.\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is close to (5,2).\n\nAfter eating (5,2), I'll be at (5,2) with body (1,2)-(2,2)? No.\n\nWhen I move to an apple, I grow.\n\nCurrent snake: head (1,2), no body. So if I move to (2,2) and no apple, I just move, head to (2,2), no body yet? Wait.\n\nRules: when you move, if no apple, you just move, head changes, but since no body, it's like the tail disappears? But with no body, moving without eating doesn't create body.\n\nI need to clarify snake mechanics.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat an apple, you grow, so the body extends.\n\nIf you don't eat, you move, and the tail moves forward, so length stays same.\n\nBut here, my snake has no body, so after moving without eating, the new head is at new position, and the old head disappears since no body to follow.\n\nSo after moving to (2,2), snake is just head at (2,2), no body.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat an apple at (5,2), when I move there, I grow, so body appears; head at (5,2), body at (4,2) or depending on direction, but since I move right to (5,2), from (4,2), so body segment would be at (4,2)? Let's think.\n\nInitial: head at (1,2)\n\nMove RIGHT to (2,2): now head at (2,2), no body because I didn't eat, and since no previous body, it's just new head.\n\nThen move RIGHT to (3,2): head at (3,2), no body.\n\nTo (4,2): same.\n\nThen to (5,2): there is apple, so I eat it. Now, when I move to (5,2), I grow, so the body is created. The head is now at (5,2), and the body is at (4,2), because I came from (4,2) to (5,2).\n\nThe body segment is added at the previous position before growth.\n\nStandard: after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment is added at the tail end, but in this case, since no body before, when I eat, the previous head position becomes body.\n\nYes: from position A to B, if no eat, head moves to B, no body or body moves? But with no initial body.\n\nSimpler: my snake is size 1. After moving to a new cell without apple, snake size remains 1, head at new position.\n\nAfter moving to a cell with apple, snake size becomes 2, head at new apple position, body at previous head position.\n\nSo for me now: head (1,2). Move to (2,2): no apple, so head now (2,2), no body.\n\nThen to (3,2): no body still.\n\nTo (4,2): same.\n\nTo (5,2): apple, eat, so now head at (5,2), body at (4,2).\n\nSize 2.\n\nBack to move: I should go RIGHT to approach (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is at (5,2), and from (1,2), going RIGHT is direct.\n\nI could go UP to (1,3), but that doesn't get me closer to (5,2); it increases y, while apple is at same y.\n\nManhattan distance: current (1,2) to (5,2) is |5-1| + |2-2| = 4.\n\nAfter UP to (1,3), distance to (5,2) is |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5, worse.\n\nAfter DOWN to (1,1), |5-1| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5, worse.\n\nAfter LEFT to (0,2), |5-0| + |2-2| = 5 + 0 = 5, worse.\n\nAfter RIGHT to (2,2), |5-2| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3, better.\n\nSo RIGHT is best for minimizing distance to (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, for (4,3): current distance |4-1| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nAfter RIGHT to (2,2), |4-2| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3, better.\n\nAfter UP to (1,3), |4-1| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3, same improvement.\n\nBut (5,2) is closer in terms of steps if I go horizontally.\n\n(5,2) is 4 steps away with no vertical change.\n\n(4,3) requires one up move.\n\nBut both are options.\n\nSince (5,2) is on the way to (4,3) in a sense, but not directly.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,3), I could go RIGHT to (4,2) then UP to (4,3), or UP to (1,3) then RIGHT to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (5,2) is specifically at (5,2).\n\nI think targeting (5,2) is fine.\n\nAlso, there is apple at (4,3), which might be eaten by enemy or something, but I should get the nearest one.\n\n(5,2) is at same y, so easier.\n\nMoreover, after getting (5,2), I can go to (4,3) or (6,8), etc.\n\nNo need to overcomplicate.\n\nFor this move, RIGHT is clear.\n\nNow, about the enemy: at (7,7). Possible moves for it: towards apples, like (3,9) or (6,8). (6,8) is closer to it: |7-6| + |7-8| =1 +1=2, while to (3,9) |7-3| + |9-7|=4+2=6, to (5,2) |7-5| + |7-2|=2+5=7, etc. So likely it might go UP or LEFT towards (6,8).\n\nNot a threat to me immediately.\n\nSo I can proceed.\n\nTherefore, I will move RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to position (2,2) to head towards the apple at (5,2), which is the closest apple and on the same row. This minimizes the distance and sets me up for future moves. The enemy snake is far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue towards (5,2) if possible, but reassess based on new positions.\n\nMove: RIGHT",

No snake or apple there. \n- DOWN to (2,1): Safe? Within bounds (x2,y1). Empty. \n- LEFT to (1,2): Safe? Within bounds (x1,y2). But this is where my head was last turn. Since I have no body, this space is now empty. No immediate danger, but moving left might not progress toward apples. \n- RIGHT to (3,2): Safe? Within bounds (x3,y2). Empty, and moves me closer to the apple at (5,2).\n\nClosest apple is still (5,2) at Manhattan distance |5-2| + |2-2| = 3. Moving RIGHT reduces this to 2. Other moves increase or maintain the distance:\n- UP to (2,3): Distance to (5,2) becomes |5-2| + |2-3| = 3+1=4 (worse)\n- DOWN to (2,1): Distance |5-2| + |2-1| = 3+1=4 (worse)\n- LEFT to (1,2): Distance |5-1| + |2-2| = 4+0=4 (worse)\n\nEnemy snake at (6,7) is moving. Possible threats:\n- It might target nearby apples like (6,8) (distance |6-6| + |8-7| = 0+1=1) or (5,2) (distance |6-5| + |7-2| =1+5=6). It will likely prioritize (6,8) since it's closer. \n- If enemy moves DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), or UP to (6,8), none directly threaten me yet. Worst case, it could move RIGHT to (7,7) or DOWN to (6,6), but I'm at (2,2), so no collision risk this turn.\n\nLong-term strategy: \n- After reaching (5,2), I can go UP to (5,3) for the apple at (4,3) or consider other apples. \n- Avoid boxing myself in; the board has space.\n\nMove decision: RIGHT to (3,2) is optimal for efficiency. No risks detected.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I reach (3,2), continue RIGHT toward (5,2) unless a new threat appears. Also, monitor enemy movement.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to advance directly toward the apple at (5,2), keeping my path efficient. The enemy is focused on the (6,8) apple and poses no immediate danger. Next turn, I'll reassess for continued right movement or redirection.\n\nMove: RIGHT",

A .   // Apple at (8,0)\n\nMy last move:\n- I moved RIGHT from (2,2) to (3,2) as planned to approach the apple at (5,2).\n\nNow I need to choose my next move from (3,2):\n- UP: To (3,3)\n- DOWN: To (3,1)\n- LEFT: To (2,2)\n- RIGHT: To (4,2)\n\nAssessing options:\n- UP to (3,3): This moves me up one space. It's within bounds. No snake or apple there. Distance to apple at (5,2) would be |5-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3. This moves me away from the direct path to (5,2). There's an apple at (4,3) which is one step up and right from here, so UP might be a detour to get that apple later, but not optimal now.\n- DOWN to (3,1): Within bounds and empty. Distance to (5,2) becomes |5-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3 (same as current distance). Not helpful for the immediate goal. Also, moving down limits my options and doesn't help gain apples quickly.\n- LEFT to (2,2): Within bounds and empty (since I just left it). But this is backtracking. Distance to (5,2) increases to |5-2| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3 (worse than if I move right). Only useful if avoiding a threat, but none exists.\n- RIGHT to (4,2): Within bounds and empty. Moves me directly toward the apple at (5,2). Distance reduces to |5-4| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1. This sets me up to eat it next turn.\n\nEnemy snake analysis:\n- Enemy at (5,7) has no body. It has options: UP to (5,8) toward apple at (6,8) (distance reduction), DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7), or RIGHT to (6,7).\n- The closest apple to it is (6,8) at distance |6-5| + |8-7| = 1 + 1 = 2. It will likely move UP to (5,8) or RIGHT to (6,7) to approach it. No direct threat to me at (3,2).\n\nMy strategy:\n- I should prioritize eating the closest apple at (5,2). Moving RIGHT minimizes steps to it.\n- After eating (5,2), I'll be at (5,2) with one body segment behind me (at 3,2). Then I can go UP to (5,3) to target apple at (4,3), or consider other paths.\n- I need to avoid potential traps later, but right now the path is clear.\n\nWhy other moves are suboptimal:\n- UP or DOWN: Increase distance to primary target without immediate apple gain.\n- LEFT: Wastes a move and moves away from targets.\n\nSafety check:\n- RIGHT to (4,2) is safe: No enemy, no wall, no self-collision (no body yet).\n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to (4,2) to get one step closer to the apple at (5,2). I'll be able to eat it next turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (4,2), I'll move RIGHT to (5,2) to eat the apple. Then reassess\u2014likely UP to (5,3) for the next apple at (4,3), but I'll check enemy positions and new apples then.\n\nFinal move decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nMy head is at (3,2), and the closest apple is at (5,2). Moving RIGHT to (4,2) reduces the Manhattan distance to this apple from 2 to 1, setting me up to eat it next turn. The enemy snake at (5,7) is focused on the apple at (6,8) and poses no immediate threat. Other moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are inefficient or increase distance to targets. \n\nStrategy next turn: After reaching (4,2), I'll move RIGHT to (5,2) to consume the apple, then likely head UP toward (4,3) or other apples based on the board state.\n\nMove: RIGHT",

Safe.\n- Other moves are safe too, but less efficient.\n\nSelf-reminder for next turn:\n- After eating (5,2), I'll have a body segment. I should avoid moving back onto it.\n- Consider enemy positions and new apples that may spawn.\n\nFinal decision: Move RIGHT to (5,2) to eat the apple.\n\nMove: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI move RIGHT to (5,2) to consume the apple and grow.

My current head is at (5,2).\n\nPossible moves from (5,2):\n- UP: to (5,3)\n- DOWN: to (5,1)\n- LEFT: to (4,2) \u2013 but this is my body segment, so collision!\n- RIGHT: to (6,2)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each move:\n\n1. UP (to (5,3)):\n   - This position is currently empty.\n   - It moves me closer to the apple at (4,3). From (5,3), I could go LEFT to (4,3) to eat the apple next turn.\n   - Distance to apple at (4,3): one step away after this move.\n   - Risk: The enemy snake is at (5,5), which is two steps away vertically. If it moves DOWN, it could be a threat later.\n\n2. DOWN (to (5,1)):\n   - Empty space but moves me away from most apples.\n   - The closest apple would be at (8,0), which is far away (distance |5-8| + |1-0| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps).\n   - Not efficient unless I have a long-term strategy.\n\n3. LEFT (to (4,2)):\n   - This is my body segment. Moving here would cause me to crash into myself and die. **Forbidden move!**\n\n4. RIGHT (to (6,2)):\n   - Empty space.\n   - Moves me horizontally toward the apple at (6,8), but that's quite far (6 steps away vertically).\n   - Also moves me away from the nearby apple at (4,3).\n\nNow, considering enemy snake #0 at (5,5):\n- It has no body, so it can move freely.\n- Potential moves for it:\n  - UP to (5,6)\n  - DOWN to (5,4)\n  - LEFT to (4,5)\n  - RIGHT to (6,5)\n- The closest apples to it are:\n  - (6,8): |6-5| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps\n  - (3,9): |3-5| + |9-5| = 2 + 4 = 6 steps\n  - (9,7): |9-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6 steps\n- It will likely move toward (6,8) by going UP or RIGHT first.\n\nThe apple at (4,3) is very close to me. If I move UP to (5,3), I can eat it next turn by moving LEFT to (4,3). That would give me two apples in two moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,2), I'd be moving away from (4,3) without a clear immediate benefit. The apple at (6,8) is far, and the enemy might get to it first.\n\nSafety check:\n- UP to (5,3): Safe, no snakes or obstacles.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Safe, but inefficient.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): Safe, but suboptimal for short-term points.\n\nLonger-term strategy:\n- After eating the apple at (4,3), I could head toward the apple at (3,9) or (6,8), depending on enemy positions.\n- I need to avoid the enemy snake. Currently, it's three steps away vertically (from (5,5) to (5,2)), so no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to (5,3) to set up for eating the apple at (4,3) next turn.\n\nSelf-memo for next turn:\n- If I move UP to (5,3), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n- Watch for enemy movement\u2014if it moves DOWN, it could become a threat near (5,4) or (5,3).\n\nFinal decision: Move UP.\n\nMove: UP\n\n</think>\n\nI am moving UP to position (5,3) to approach the apple at (4,3). This sets me up to eat it next turn and continue growing. The enemy snake at (5,5) is not an immediate threat, and this move avoids my body at (4,2). \n\nStrategy for next turn: Plan to move LEFT to (4,3) to consume the apple, then evaluate other targets like (3,9) or (6,8) while monitoring enemy positions.\n\nUP",

A\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . 0 . . . .\n 3 . . . . A 1 . . . .\n 2 . . . . . T . . . .  [T is my tail/body at (5,2)]\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . . . . . A .\n\nSo:\n- Row 4: Enemy snake #0 head at (5,4) - it has no body.\n- Row 3: Apple at (4,3) and my head at (5,3).\n- Row 2: My body at (5,2) - marked as 'T' for tail.\n\nNow, my current position is head at (5,3). Possible moves:\n- UP: to (5,4)\n- DOWN: to (5,2)\n- LEFT: to (4,3)\n- RIGHT: to (6,3)\n\nBut I need to consider collisions and apples.\n\nFirst, the enemy snake is at (5,4). If I move UP to (5,4), that's where the enemy head is, so I would collide with the enemy snake and die. That would be bad.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,2) would take me to my own body segment at (5,2) - that's a collision with myself.\n\nSo forbidden moves: UP and DOWN are both deadly.\n\nNow LEFT: to (4,3). That position has an apple! So if I move LEFT, I would eat the apple at (4,3), grow, and gain a point. After eating, my body would extend. So next turn, my body would be [(5,3), (5,2)] and head at (4,3).\n\nRIGHT: to (6,3). That position is currently empty. No apple, no snake. So I would just move there.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT, LEFT allows me to eat the apple and grow. RIGHT does nothing immediately beneficial.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (5,4). It has possible moves:\n- UP to (5,5)\n- DOWN to (5,3) \u2013 but (5,3) is currently my head, but after I move, it might change. However, if I move LEFT, then (5,3) becomes my body, so if enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), it would collide with my body and die. But that's not my concern; I need to avoid colliding with the enemy.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,3), I'm safe from the enemy because (5,4) is not adjacent to (4,3) except diagonally, and moves are only horizontal/vertical. So no immediate threat.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,3), I'm also safe.\n\nBut eating the apple is clearly the best choice since it gives me a point and grows my snake.\n\nNow, looking at the apples:\n- (3,9) is far away.\n- (8,0) is far.\n- (6,8) and (9,7) are also not close.\n\nBut after eating (4,3), I can plan my next move. From (4,3), I could go UP to (4,4), but that might put me closer to the enemy if it's still at (5,4). Or I could go LEFT to (3,3), then up toward (3,9).\n\nThe enemy at (5,4) might move toward other apples, like (6,8) by going UP or RIGHT.\n\nSince I have to choose between LEFT and RIGHT, LEFT is the apple-eating move, so it's the best.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nSelf-memo for next turn: After eating, head to (3,9) or avoid the enemy if it comes near. From (4,3), options: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But need to see updated board.\n\nSo my move: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (4,3) to eat the apple there. This gains me a point, grows my snake, and avoids any immediate threats. The enemy snake at (5,4) cannot reach me in this move, and I am not colliding with any obstacles.\n\nStrategy note for next turn: After eating, my head will be at (4,3) with body segments at (5,3) and (5,2). From there, I should consider moving UP to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,3) to target the apple at (3,9), while monitoring the enemy's position.\n\nLEFT",
