Assuming the head is at (5,5), body likely is [(5,6), (6,6), (7,6)] (the tail extends back).\n- Remaining apples: (0,2), (0,5), (2,4), (7,9)\n- Enemy snake #0 head at (7,3), body at (7,2).\n\n**Now, possible moves from (5,5):**\n\n- UP to (5,6):  \n  - My own body is at (5,6) from previous steps (just moved from there), so moving UP is moving onto my body => collision, death. INVALID.\n\n- DOWN to (5,4):  \n  - Is (5,4) occupied? No apple there. Is it occupied by body or enemy? No. Within bounds? Yes. SAFE.\n\n- LEFT to (4,5):  \n  - (4,5) empty cell, no apple. SAFE.\n\n- RIGHT to (6,5):  \n  - (6,5) empty cell, no apple, no snake.

I want to head toward those apples next.\n\nThe closest apple now seems to be (2,4) or (0,5).\n\n**Distance modes:**\n\n- Current head at (5,5).\n\n- Distance to (2,4): |5-2| + |5-4| = 3 +1=4 steps.\n\n- Distance to (0,5): 5 steps.\n\n- Distance to (0,2): 5 + 3 =8.\n\n- Distance to (7,9): 2 +4=6.\n\nAmong these, (2,4) is the closest.\n\nIs there an immediate step towards (2,4)?\n\n(5,5) to (4,5) would move closer to x=2.\n\n(5,5) to (5,4) reduces y but moves away from apple at y=4 to y=4? No, exactly at y=4.\n\nSo going DOWN to (5,4) moves closer vertically.\n\nAnyway, moving DOWN or LEFT seems reasonable.\n\nIs there any danger going DOWN?\n\n- Enemy snake is at (7,3), not close.\n\n- My body is at (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) after growth. So (5,4), (4,5), and (6,5) are free.\n\nConsidering that my position is at (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,4) puts me closer to apple at (2,4) and no immediate threat.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,5) also brings me closer horizontally.\n\nMoving RIGHT doesn't provide any advantage toward apples.\n\nI would avoid moving UP into my own body (5,6).\n\nTherefore, next move would be either DOWN or LEFT.\n\nBetween the two, moving DOWN to (5,4) aligns me vertically with apple at (2,4).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can plan to move LEFT next turn to approach (2,4).\n\nAlso, no immediate danger.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMove DOWN to (5,4).\n\n**Next turn strategy:**\n\nAfter moving down, I will move LEFT towards (2,4) apple, and then consider heading towards (0,5) and (0,2).\n\nIf enemy snakes approach, I will re-evaluate path for safety.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"
