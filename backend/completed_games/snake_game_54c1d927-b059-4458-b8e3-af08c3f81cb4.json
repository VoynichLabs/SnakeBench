          "rationale": "Yo, what is UP, chat! We're back in the arena, turn zero! Can you believe the audacity of this Snake #0 starting right up there? He thinks he's hot stuff. We're showing him what 'hot' really means\u2014a tight constriction that will make him crash out! \ud83d\udd25\n\nAlright, listen up, we're at (3, 2) and Snake #0 is at (2, 7). We're both starting fresh, no body to worry about yet, but the danger of simultaneous head-on collisions is 100% real. We need to be aggressive but smart.\n\n**OUR GOALS RIGHT NOW (Turn 0):**\n\n1.  **Safety First:** Don't crash into the walls or the enemy's starting position. Since we're both just heads, the only immediate crash risk is moving into the same cell if we move towards each other, or if we move out of bounds.\n2.  **Positioning:** We need to move towards a more central position, or potentially start dominating a side of the board.\n3.  **Apples:** There's an apple at (4, 2) right next to us! That's easy points and vital length early on.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves from (3, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 3):** Moves towards an apple at (3, 3). Safe from walls.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 1):** Safe from walls. Moves away from the action initially.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 2):** Safe from walls.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 2):** **CRUCIAL MOVE!** Lands us *directly* on an apple at (4, 2). EZ points!\n\n**Considering Enemy Movement (Snake #0 at (2, 7)):**\n\nSnake #0 is likely going to go for the apple at (2, 6) or maybe (0, 6), or perhaps head towards the center/right to contest.\n\n*   If he moves DOWN to (2, 6) (an apple), he's safe.\n*   If he moves RIGHT to (3, 7), he's safe.\n*   If he moves LEFT to (1, 7), he's safe.\n*   If he moves UP to (2, 8), he's safe.\n\nSince we are so far apart (5 units vertical distance, 1 unit horizontal distance), a head-on collision right now is impossible unless one of us jumps teleportation levels, which we can't!\n\n**The Master Plan for Turn 0:**\n\nWe seize the easy points! An apple at (4, 2) is too good to pass up. Getting length early dictates board dominance.\n\n*   Current Position: (3, 2)\n*   Move: RIGHT to (4, 2). Eat apple. Length 1 -> 2.\n\nThis move is perfectly safe, guarantees us an early lead in length, and positions us well to move up the board next turn, maybe targeting the apple at (4, 9) or (5, 7).\n\nWe're going for the early aggressive growth! Let's get this $W$, chat! \ud83e\udd11\n\nRIGHT",

We are starting at (2, 7) and our rival is way down at (3, 2). He thinks he's safe? HE THINKS HE'S SAFE?! Not on my watch! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**THE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** Moves us to (2, 8). It's safe, keeps us high on the board, but moves us further from the action. \n- **DOWN:** Moves us to (2, 6). Yo, there is an APPLE right there at (2, 6)! If we take this, we grow immediately. It also puts us on a path to eventually cut off his upward expansion. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n- **LEFT:** Moves us to (1, 7). Safe, but boring. We don't do boring here!\n- **RIGHT:** Moves us to (3, 7). Puts us in the same column as his head. Intriguing... but no immediate growth.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe are going for that apple at (2, 6) IMMEDIATELY. Why? Because size matters in the clinch! If we grab (2, 6) this turn, we are one step ahead in the score and one segment longer, making us harder to box in later. He's probably going for the apples near (4, 2) or (2, 3). Let him scavenge the crumbs while we dominate the top-left and prepare to rotate down for the clinch! \ud83e\udd4b\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nSecure the immediate apples at (2, 6) and (0, 6) to get a body length advantage. Once we have a tail, we're going to use it as a wall to force him into the corners. He's at (3, 2), so he\u2019s cramped near the bottom. If we control the middle-left, he\u2019s got nowhere to go but into US! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLet's get this first bite and show him who owns this 10x10!\n\nDOWN",

But \"tied\" isn't winning, and we're here to WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**CURRENT INTEL:**\n- **Our Head:** (2, 6) | **Our Body:** (2, 7)\n- **Rival Head:** (4, 2) | **Rival Body:** (3, 2)\n- **The Board:** We\u2019re in the upper-left quadrant, he's chilling in the bottom-middle. He thinks he can just hang out down there? NOT TODAY!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** Leads to (2, 7). NOPE! That's our own body. That's a \"clip it and fail\" moment. We don't do that here! \ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN:** Takes us to (2, 5). It's open space, moving us closer to the cluster of apples at (2, 3), (3, 3), and (6, 3).\n- **LEFT:** Takes us to (1, 6). There's an apple at (0, 6)! If we go left now, we're one step away from another growth spurt! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **RIGHT:** Takes us to (3, 6). Puts us in the middle of the board. High risk, high reward? Maybe, but there are better snacks elsewhere.\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nWe need to keep our lead! There is an apple sitting right there at (0, 6). If we grab that, we get to 3 segments while he\u2019s still struggling at 2. Plus, by staying on the edge, we make it harder for him to wrap around us. We are going to loop left, grab (0, 6), and then survey the board to see if we can cut off his path to the (2,3)/(3,3) cluster. We want to be the wall he crashes into! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure (0, 6) immediately. After that, we dive DOWN towards the row 3 apples.

We are at (4, 2), length 2! Snake #0 is now head (2, 6), also length 2, so we're tied on length, but we were the first on the board to secure the growth! That's psychological dominance, right there!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n\n*   **Our Head:** (4, 2)\n*   **Our Body (Tail):** (3, 2)\n*   **Enemy Head (Snake #0):** (2, 6)\n*   **Enemy Body (Tail):** (2, 7)\n*   **Scores:** We're tied 1-1. We need to press the advantage!\n*   **Board:** 10x10. We're in the bottom center-right. Enemy is in the center-left.\n\n**Goal for Turn 1:**\n\nWe've secured the growth. Now, it's time to choose a quadrant to dominate and start moving towards the enemy to restrict his space, or grab more apples before he does. Look at all those apples in the center-right! (8, 3), (6, 3), (6, 5), (9, 4)\u2014that's a feast!\n\nSince we are (4, 2) and he is (2, 6), there is still a significant distance between us. We can afford one more growth move before focusing solely on cutting him off.\n\n**Evaluating Our Safe Moves from (4, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 3):** Safe. Moves towards the center of the board and right into an apple at (4, 3)? Wait, let's scan the board... no apple at (4, 3). The closest apples are (3, 3) to the left, (5, 7) and (4, 9) far up. This moves us away from our tail (3, 2), opening up the board.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 1):** Safe. Moves us towards the bottom edge. Less ideal for fighting the opponent or center board dominance, but safe.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 2):** **SUICIDE!** This is our tail cell from the previous turn! Moving directly backwards into our body segments is a fatal flaw. WE ELIMINATE LEFT.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 2):** Safe. Moves us towards the clear right side. This looks like a great option for future growth and safety.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP vs. DOWN vs. RIGHT):**\n\n*   **DOWN:** Too conservative, gets us cornered if we're not careful.\n*   **UP:** Good, centralizing move. Prepares us to strike up the board towards (4, 9) and (5, 7).\n*   **RIGHT:** Also good. It allows us to swing wide and start claiming the right 5 columns, where there are a ton of apples like (6, 3), (8, 3), (9, 4).\n\nLet's consider what the enemy is likely doing from (2, 6).\n\n**Predicting Snake #0's Movement (from 2, 6):**\n\nSnake #0's focus is likely UP or LEFT to grab the apples in the top-left quadrant quickly. There's a cluster of three apples within 3 turns travel (0, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9).\n\n*   He might go **DOWN** to (2, 5). Safe, but less enticing.\n*   He might go **LEFT** to (1, 6). Safe, towards the Apple at (0, 6).\n*   He might go **RIGHT** to (3, 6). Safe, gets slightly more central.\n*   He might go **UP** to (2, 7). **SUICIDE!** That is his tail! WE ELIMINATE UP for enemy.\n\nTherefore, he will likely go LEFT to (1, 6) or RIGHT to (3, 6). If he goes LEFT, he's solidifying control of the top-left area. If he goes RIGHT, he's moving towards the middle, perhaps to try and cross us later.\n\n**Our Strategy: Aggressive Centralization and Control**\n\nWe need to start moving *up* the board to both secure the apples and eventually box him in. If we move RIGHT, we give him the vertical space to move up untouched. Moving UP to (4, 3) is a strong strategic choice. It puts us on his Y-axis, maintains our central column, and sets us up to potentially cut him off if he tries to move right later.\n\nIf we move UP to (4, 3):\n\n*   Safety check: (4, 3) is empty, safe from walls, safe from our tail (3, 2).\n*   Enemy proximity: (2, 6) is far away. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nLet's prioritize getting that center vertical line (x=4) claimed before he can move right and contest it. We go vertical, chat! We're putting the pressure on!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 2/3):**\nContinue moving UP (4, 4), then maybe LEFT or RIGHT. We need to get closer to the top half of the board while looking for growth opportunities. Once we hit the halfway mark (Y=5), we can start looking to cut off snake #0.\n\nLet's secure the central vertical approach!\n\nUP",

We've got 2 segments, and there is a juicy apple literally RIGHT IN FRONT OF US at (0, 6) Wait, can we get it? YES WE CAN!\n\n**THE INTEL:**\n- **Our Head:** (1, 6) | **Our Body:** [(2, 6)]\n- **Enemy Head:** (4, 3) | **Enemy Body:** [(4, 2)]\n- **Distance:** He's chilling at (4,3), we're at (1,6). He\u2019s not a threat to our head *this* second, but he's hovering near that massive cluster of apples at row 3. We can't let him get fat off those while we're stuck in the corner!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** Takes us to (1, 7). Safe, but ignoring the apple right next to us? CHAT WOULD ROAST ME! \u274c\n- **DOWN:** Takes us to (1, 5). Moves us closer to his territory, but again, we'd be leaving food on the table. \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 6) - THAT'S OUR OWN TAIL! We would literally fold ourselves like a lawn chair. ABSOLUTELY NOT! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT:** (0, 6) - BINGO! That's an apple, baby! That puts us at 3 segments and secures the lead! \u2705\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nWe are taking the LEFT move to (0, 6) to snag that apple. This grows us to length 3. Meanwhile, Snake #1 is likely going to pivot towards (3, 3) or (5, 3) to grab those apples. After we hit the wall at (0, 6), we are going to pivot DOWN the 0-column. \n\nWhy? Because if we stay on the edge, he can't get behind us. We\u2019re going to loop around and enter that row 3 apple-fest from the flank! If we can grow to length 4 or 5 before he does, we can literally just walk across the board and cut him off from the entire bottom half! \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (0, 6) this turn. Next turn, we move DOWN to (0, 5) and then likely (0, 4) to snag that apple too! We're building a wall on the left side to trap him in the middle. If he tries to challenge us, we'll have the length to make him regret it! LET'S GET THIS W!\n\nLEFT",

A clean 'UP' move to (4, 3) last turn, claiming that sweet central real estate. *Chef's kiss*!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 2):**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (4, 3). Length: 2.\n*   **Our Body (Tail):** (4, 2).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (1, 6). Length: 2.\n*   **Enemy Body (Tail):** (2, 6).\n*   **Scores:** Tied 1-1.

We have a clear path to control the right side and upper half, but we need to move fast if we want to clash with him on our terms!\n\n**Predicting Enemy Move (ID 0 from 1, 6):**\n\nThe enemy is feeling the pressure, but he has an immediate apple at (0, 6)!\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (1, 6):\n1.  **LEFT (0, 6):** BOOM! Apple grab. This is the extremely likely move. He gets length 3 and controls the left edge.\n2.  **RIGHT (2, 6):** **SUICIDE!** That's his tail! A classic blunder he won't make. We eliminate RIGHT.\n3.  **UP (1, 7):** Safe, but slows the apple acquisition.\n4.  **DOWN (1, 5):** Safe, moves him down and away from the apple.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 goes LEFT to (0, 6). He will score, making the score 2-2.\n\n**Goal for Turn 2: Aggressive Expansion and Apple Hunting!**\n\nWe are at (4, 3). We need to get some points and get some board presence. The nearest apple is (3, 3).\n\n**Evaluating Our Safe Moves from (4, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 4):** Safe. Moves us further up the central axis. Establishes vertical control.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 2):** **SUICIDE!** Hitting our own body segment. We eliminate DOWN.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 3):** **APPLE GRAB!** Perfect move! We grab the apple, grow to length 3, and tie the score if my prediction of his move is correct, or take the lead if he messes up!\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 3):** Safe. Moves us towards the right-side cluster of apples ((6, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3)). Opens up the right side.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP vs. LEFT vs. RIGHT):**\n\n*   **UP:** Good positional play, but no immediate growth.\n*   **RIGHT:** Good for future growth (a cluster of apples is right of us), but slightly slower than LEFT.\n*   **LEFT (3, 3):** This is a guaranteed point and growth! The enemy is likely growing this turn, so we MUST grow too to maintain parity and confidence! This move gives us immediate length and control over the center-bottom region.\n\nCheck for Head-on Collision Risk:\n*   We move to (3, 3).\n*   Snake #0 moves, likely to (0, 6).\n*   No risk of collision. We are separated by far too much distance (Manhattan distance 6).\n\nThe choice is clear, chat. We snag the point! We go for the immediate, guaranteed growth at (3, 3). No reason to wait when there's an apple right there!\n\nThis move to LEFT secures our length and puts us in a great position to then swing RIGHT on Turn 3 towards the (6, 3) and (8, 3) apple cluster. Dominate the lower half, then move up and squeeze him!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 3/4):**\nAfter grabbing the apple at (3, 3) (moving LEFT), we will be at (3, 3) and length 3. Snake #0 will likely be at (0, 6) and length 3. We should then pivot to the RIGHT, moving to (4, 3), then (5, 3), to quickly consume the apples on the right side of the board and secure a dominant length lead. We need to force him into making a mistake!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Yo, what is up, Chat! We are back for Turn 3! Two apples in the bag, feeling good, tied again with Snake #0. It\u2019s a cage match in the making! Let\u2019s break down the current state and figure out how we\u2019re going to dominate this board!\n\n### **Current State Analysis (Turn 3):**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** $\\text{(3, 3)}$. Length: 3. We just ate, and we're looking plump!\n*   **Our Body (Tail):** $\\text{(4, 3)}, \\text{(4, 2)}$.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** $\\text{(0, 6)}$. Length: 3. Looks like my prediction was spot-on; he snagged that apple and is hugging the wall!\n*   **Enemy Body (Tail):** $\\text{(1, 6)}, \\text{(2, 6)}$.\n*   **Scores:** Tied 2-2. We need to break this deadlock and get RUUUUNNING!\n\n### **Predicting Enemy Move (ID 0 from 0, 6):**\n\nSnake #0 is on the left wall at $\\text{(0, 6)}$. He needs to move *somewhere*!\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from $\\text{(0, 6)}$:\n1.  **LEFT (WIPEOUT!):** Off the board. He won't make this mistake, right? Eliminated.\n2.  **RIGHT (1, 6):** **SUICIDE!** $\\text{(1, 6)}$ is currently his body segment. Eliminated.\n3.  **UP (0, 7):** Safe. Keeps him on the wall and in a position to eventually grab $\\text{(0, 4)}$ or $\\text{(1, 8)}$.\n4.  **DOWN (0, 5):** Safe. Moves him closer to the $\\text{(0, 4)}$ apple. This looks highly likely; he will try to control the entire left edge.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 goes **DOWN** to $\\text{(0, 5)}$ to stick to the wall and pressure the $\\text{(0, 4)}$ apple. This secures the bottom-left corner for him.\n\n### **Goal for Turn 3: Pivot Right and Establish a Lead!**\n\nWe are perfectly positioned at $\\text{(3, 3)}$. We have a cluster of apples just to our right: $\\text{(6, 3)}, \\text{(8, 3)}, \\text{(9, 3)}, \\text{(8, 5)}, \\text{(6, 5)}$. This whole right-bottom quadrant is ours for the taking! We need to move towards it to gain a quick size advantage.\n\n### **Evaluating Our Safe Moves from (3, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 4):** Safe. Moves us toward potential targets like $\\text{(2, 3)}$ and $\\text{(5, 7)}$, but slower than heading right.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 2):** Safe. Moves us away from all immediate apples. Not ideal when trying to dominate.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 3):** **APPLE GRAB!** We can grab another apple immediately! This is huge. If we grab this, we are 3-2 on apples and length 4!\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 3):** **SUICIDE!** That is the segment right behind our head. We eliminate RIGHT.\n\nWait a second, Chat! We can grab another apple IMMEDIATELY by moving $\\text{LEFT}$ to $\\text{(2, 3)}$! That is incredible board control and growth potential. Why didn't I see that sooner? It was marked as an 'A' in the board state!\n\n**Let's check the board state for $\\text{(2, 3)}$:**\n\n```\n 3 . A A 1 T . A . A A\n```\nYes! $\\text{(2, 3)}$ is an apple! This is the play!\n\n### **Collision Check (Moving LEFT to (2, 3)):**\n\n*   **Our position:** $\\text{(2, 3)}$.\n*   **Enemy position (Predicted DOWN):** $\\text{(0, 5)}$.\n*   No risk of collision. We are miles away!\n\n### **Strategy Confirmation:**\n\nMoving $\\text{LEFT}$ to $\\text{(2, 3)}$ secures Apple #3 for us, putting us ahead 3-2 and growing us to length 4. This is a massive temporary advantage that lets us control the flow of the game for the next few turns.\n\nOnce we are at $\\text{(2, 3)}$ and size 4, we should immediately pivot UP and then RIGHT, focusing on eating the remaining apples at $\\text{(6, 3)}$ and $\\text{(8, 3)}$. We must quickly gain size and then use that size to cut off Snake #0 as he tries to leave the left-hand wall! Our path UP/RIGHT will ultimately lead us to the center strip, allowing us to squeeze him out of the top half of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 4/5):**\nAfter moving LEFT to $\\text{(2, 3)}$ (grabbing the apple), our head will be at $\\text{(2, 3)}$ and length 4. Snake #0 will likely be at $\\text{(0, 5)}$ and length 4. For Turn 4, we must move $\\text{UP}$ to $\\text{(2, 4)}$ to reposition ourselves for a move $\\text{RIGHT}$ toward the apple clusters on the right side. We have to be aggressive and greedy while he's boxed into the small corridor on the left.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, Chat. We grab the third apple and secure the lead! LET'S GET THIS W!\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re about to humbled this man!\n\n**THE INTEL:**\n- **Our Head:** (0, 5) | **Body:** [(0, 6), (1, 6)]\n- **Enemy Head:** (2, 3) | **Enemy Body:** [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)]\n- **Board Hazard:** We are on the left edge. If we aren't careful, he can pin us against the wall! \n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (0, 6) - CHAT, NO! That\u2019s our own body! We aren't trying to ends the stream early! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT:** (-1, 5) - Off the map! We don't clip through walls in this house! \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (1, 5) - Safe, but it puts us closer to his \"kill zone\" without a direct payoff. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **DOWN:** (0, 4) - **THE GIGA-BRAIN PLAY!** There is an apple sitting right there at (0, 4)! We grab that, we grow to length 4, and we pull even on the scoreboard! Plus, it keeps us moving along the perimeter, making us harder to corner! \u2705\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nWe are going **DOWN** to (0, 4) to snag that apple! This is \"Content Gold,\" chat! Look at Snake #1 at (2, 3). If he tries to move LEFT to (1, 3) to contest us, he\u2019s getting dangerously close to the wall. We want to bait him into the bottom-left corner and then wrap around him like a blanket! He thinks he\u2019s winning because he has 3 apples? Watch this comeback! \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure (0, 4) this turn. Next, we look at (0, 3) or (1, 4). There\u2019s a cluster of apples at (1, 3) and (2, 3) that he's eyeing. If we can get to (0, 3), we are literally side-by-side with him. If he\u2019s at length 4 and we\u2019re at length 4, a head-on collision is a DRAW, but if we can stay one step ahead and make him crash into our tail as we circle him, it's GG EZ!

          "rationale": "Yo, what is UP, Chat! Welcome back to the main event! We are absolutely crushing it! Turn 4, and we just bagged the third apple! Three to two lead! LFG!\n\n### **Current State Analysis (Turn 4):**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** $\\text{(2, 3)}$. Length: 4. We are long and strong, baby!\n*   **Our Body (Tail):** $\\text{(3, 3)}, \\text{(4, 3)}, \\text{(4, 2)}$.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** $\\text{(0, 5)}$. Length: 4. My prediction was spot on\u2014he went $\\text{DOWN}$ and is hugging the wall, securing the bottom-left corner with his length.\n*   **Enemy Body (Tail):** $\\text{(0, 6)}, \\text{(1, 6)}, \\text{(2, 6)}$.\n*   **Scores:** We lead 3-2! We gotta press this advantage!\n\n### **Predicting Enemy Move (ID 0 from 0, 5):**\n\nSnake #0 is stuck on the left wall at $\\text{(0, 5)}$. He needs to move!\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from $\\text{(0, 5)}$:\n1.  **LEFT (WIPEOUT!):** Off the board. Eliminated.\n2.  **RIGHT (1, 5):** Safe. Gets him moving into the open board area. This is a very logical move if he wants freedom.\n3.  **UP (0, 6):** **SUICIDE!** $\\text{(0, 6)}$ is currently his body segment. Eliminated.\n4.  **DOWN (0, 4):** **APPLE GRAB!** $\\text{(0, 4)}$ is an apple! This is the most likely, aggressive move. He's trying to tie the score back up and secure the bottom corner.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 goes **DOWN** to $\\text{(0, 4)}$ to eat the apple. He'll tie us at 3-3, but we'll still have board position dominance.\n\n### **Goal for Turn 4: Execute the Pivot and DOMINATE the Right Side!**\n\nChat, remember our long-term plan? We pivot $\\text{UP}$ then arc $\\text{RIGHT}$. We are currently at $\\text{(2, 3)}$. We need to maneuver now towards that juicy cluster of apples on the right side: $\\text{(6, 3)}, \\text{(8, 3)}, \\text{(9, 3)}, \\text{(8, 5)}, \\text{(6, 5)}$. We need to get big, and we need to get in his way!\n\n### **Evaluating Our Safe Moves from (2, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (2, 4):** Safe. Moves us further from the enemy and positions us for the next $\\text{RIGHT}$ move toward the middle. This is the calculated pivot move.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 2):** Safe. Moves us too close to our tail ($\\text{(4, 2)}$) and away from the action. Not optimal.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 3):** Safe. Moves us directly toward the enemy's path, but we risk getting trapped on the bottom half of the board if he continues to move $\\text{DOWN}$ and $\\text{RIGHT}$. $\\text{(1, 3)}$ is an apple! This is tempting, but strategically, it keeps us too low.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 3):** **SUICIDE!** $\\text{(3, 3)}$ is our body segment. Eliminated.\n\n### **The Decision: Aggressive Apple Grab vs. Strategic Board Position**\n\nIf we move $\\text{LEFT}$ to $\\text{(1, 3)}$, we eat another apple (4-3 lead, length 5). This is a HUGE score advantage, and it limits his options into the bottom half of the map.\n\nIf we move $\\text{UP}$ to $\\text{(2, 4)}$, we gain board position (length 4), setting up a fast run $\\text{RIGHT}$ up the middle towards $\\text{(5, 7)}$ or $\\text{(6, 5)}$.\n\nLet's look at the risk if we go $\\text{LEFT}$ to $\\text{(1, 3)}$ (Apple move):\n*   Our Head: $\\text{(1, 3)}$.\n*   Enemy Head (Predicted $\\text{DOWN}$): $\\text{(0, 4)}$.\n*   The gap is small, but no head-to-head collision risk.\n\nIf we grab the apple at $\\text{(1, 3)}$, we gain immediate length and a score lead, which is our primary goal. We can then pivot $\\text{UP}$ on Turn 5 to $\\text{(1, 4)}$ or $\\text{(2, 4)}$ depending on safety. Getting massive is the fastest way to box him out!\n\nChat, we're not running from the fire, we're running toward the feast! Let's get that length and use it to dominate the centerline!\n\n**Revised Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 5/6):**\nAfter moving $\\text{LEFT}$ to $\\text{(1, 3)}$ (grabbing the apple), our head will be at $\\text{(1, 3)}$ and length 5. Snake #0 will likely be at $\\text{(0, 4)}$ and length 5. For Turn 5, we must move $\\text{UP}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$ or $\\text{UP}$ to $\\text{(2, 4)}$ to start moving $\\text{RIGHT}$. We are going to quickly out-grow him and seize control of the center column, denying him access to the right side of the board! We are cornering him on the left now!\n\nThis is the move. Get long, get dominant, get the fourth apple!\n\nLEFT",

He\u2019s trying to flex his size, but we\u2019re about to show him who really runs this 10x10 grid! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE INTEL:**\n- **Our Head:** (0, 4) | **Body:** [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)]\n- **Enemy Head:** (1, 3) | **Enemy Body:** [(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)]\n- **The Situation:** He\u2019s right below us and to the right! He\u2019s trying to cut us off from the middle of the board!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (0, 5) - **NO WAY!** That\u2019s our own gorgeous neck! We don't self-destruct for the clips! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT:** (-1, 4) - **OUT OF BOUNDS!** Chat, I\u2019m not trying to get banned from the server! \u274c\n- **DOWN:** (0, 3) - **STAY CALM!** This is risky territory. If we go to (0, 3) and he moves LEFT to (0, 3), we BOTH go down in a head-on collision.

He\u2019s got more apples, but we\u2019ve got more heart! \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure (1, 4) and observe his movement. If he continues moving LEFT, he\u2019s going to trap himself against the wall at (0, 3). If he turns DOWN, we follow him and squeeze! We need to find an opening to grab one of those apples at (1, 7) or (1, 8) soon to equalize the score, but for this millisecond, it's all about **POSITIONING.** Let's get out of the corner and into his face! \n\nRIGHT",

We are massive and hungry!\n*   **Our Body (Tail):** $\\text{(2, 3)}, \\text{(3, 3)}, \\text{(4, 3)}, \\text{(4, 2)}$.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** $\\text{(0, 4)}$. Length: 5. As predicted, he went $\\text{DOWN}$, grabbed the apple, and tied our length. He's hugging the wall, making himself vulnerable!\n*   **Enemy Body (Tail):** $\\text{(0, 5)}, \\text{(0, 6)}, \\text{(1, 6)}, \\text{(2, 6)}$.\n*   **Scores:** We lead 4-3! We still have the score advantage, and we're positioned beautifully to cut him off.\n\n### **GOAL: Execution of the Box-In! Time to move UP and seal the center!**\n\nSnake #0 is currently at $\\text{(0, 4)}$. He has a limited set of safe moves before he hits the wall or gets entangled.\n\n### **Predicting Enemy Move (ID 0 from 0, 4):**\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from $\\text{(0, 4)}$:\n1.  **LEFT (WIPEOUT!):** Off the board. Eliminated.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 3):** Safe. Keeps him stuck on the side, but he's safe.\n3.  **UP (0, 5):** **SUICIDE!** $\\text{(0, 5)}$ is his body segment now. Eliminated.\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 4):** Safe. This is the move he *must* make if he wants to get free. It moves him into the open board area.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 goes **RIGHT** to $\\text{(1, 4)}$. He is claustrophobic; he needs to breathe! If he goes $\\text{RIGHT}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$, he's coming right onto my flank!\n\n### **Evaluating Our Safe Moves from (1, 3):**\n\nWe need to make a move that either:\nA) Cuts him off aggressively, or\nB) Positions us to eat the next apple and grow even more, using our length as a blocker.\n\n1.  **UP (1, 4):** Collision risk! If he moves **RIGHT** to $\\text{(1, 4)}$, and we move **UP** to $\\text{(1, 4)}$, we get a **DOUBLE KO**! We have the score advantage (4-3), so a draw is better for us than a loss, but we are here to DOMINATE, not draw! We check the board: $\\text{(1, 4)}$ is empty. This is the ultimate aggressive move, but it's high risk.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 2):** Safe. Moves us away from the action, but still gives us access to move $\\text{RIGHT}$ later.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 3):** Potential cut-off. If he goes $\\text{DOWN}$ to $\\text{(0, 3)}$, and we go $\\text{LEFT}$ to $\\text{(1, 3)}$, we box him closer to the $\\text{(0, 2)}$ corner. If he goes $\\text{RIGHT}$, we move in behind him. $\\text{(0, 3)}$ is free.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 3):** **SUICIDE!** $\\text{(2, 3)}$ is our body segment. Eliminated.\n\n### **Strategic Decision: The Block or The Bypass?**\n\nOur goal is to seize the center board and force him into the corner.\n\nIf we go **UP (1, 4)** and he goes **RIGHT (1, 4)**, it's a mutual death. 4-3 lead, so we'd win the game right now. That's an EZ WIN! Does he *dare* move $\\text{RIGHT}$ when he knows we are sitting right beneath his exit point, waiting to move $\\text{UP}$? Maybe not.\n\nIf he wants to survive, he will likely move $\\text{DOWN}$ to $\\text{(0, 3)}$.\n\nLet's assume the safest move for the *enemy* is $\\text{DOWN}$ to $\\text{(0, 3)}$.\n*   Enemy Head: $\\text{(0, 3)}$.\n\nIf we assume he moves $\\text{DOWN}$, we should move $\\text{UP}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$ and get ready to run $\\text{RIGHT}$ and choke out the mid-board. This allows us to start securing the central axis $\\text{(1, X)}$.\n\nIf we go $\\text{UP}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$:\n*   We gain position.\n*   We set up a run for the apple at $\\text{(4, 9)}$ or $\\text{(5, 7)}$ later.\n*   We threaten the $Y=4$ row, which is his only escape route to freedom!\n\nWhat if he goes $\\text{RIGHT}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$? We trade. 4-3 win.\n\nWait, Chat, this is an excellent opportunity! My last rationale stated: \"For Turn 5, we must move $\\text{UP}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$ or $\\text{UP}$ to $\\text{(2, 4)}$ to start moving $\\text{RIGHT}$.\" We are currently at $\\text{(1, 3)}$.\n\nIf we go $\\text{UP}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$:\nIf Enemy: $\\text{RIGHT}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$ -> Double KO. WIN.\nIf Enemy: $\\text{DOWN}$ to $\\text{(0, 3)}$ -> We get the positional advantage at $\\text{(1, 4)}$, setting up the trap!\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to **(0, 3)**:\nIf Enemy: $\\text{RIGHT}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$ -> He escapes; we are stuck in the corner. BAD.\nIf Enemy: $\\text{DOWN}$ to $\\text{(0, 3)}$ -> Double KO. WIN.\n\nIf we go **DOWN** to **(1, 2)**:\nIf Enemy: $\\text{RIGHT}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$ -> He escapes; we are nowhere near. BAD.\nIf Enemy: $\\text{DOWN}$ to $\\text{(0, 3)}$ -> He just moves ahead of us. BAD.\n\nThe move is clearly **UP**. We force the crisis. If he goes for the escape (RIGHT), we win instantly on the score advantage. If he bottlenecks himself (DOWN), we gain perfect position to start controlling the highway at $X=1, Y=4$.\n\nThe game is about dominating the board with length. We need to move into open territory. $\\text{UP}$ to $\\text{(1, 4)}$ sets us up to pivot $\\text{RIGHT}$ to $\\text{(2, 4)}$ next turn (if safe), boxing him into the left periphery.\n\nLet's lock it in, Chat. We force the issue!\n\n### **Long Term Plan (Turn 6+):**\nIf successful at (1, 4), move RIGHT to (2, 4) or UP to (1, 5) depending on where Snake #0's new body makes the move safest. Our goal is to use our length to dominate the center columns (X=2 through X=5) and starve him of apples.\n\nUP",
