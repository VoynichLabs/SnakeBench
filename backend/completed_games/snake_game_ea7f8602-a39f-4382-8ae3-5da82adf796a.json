It is time to assert dominance! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Current Board Analysis:**\nOur head: (2, 2).\nEnemy head: (7, 8).\nBoard size: 10x10.\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Get some early board control and maybe snag an apple if it's safe. But most importantly, position ourselves to dominate the central or western side of the board while keeping an eye on the enemy.\n\n**Turn 0: Evaluating Moves from (2, 2)**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 3):** Safe. Moves us toward the center and away from the dense clutter of apples down low, which could become a trap later. It keeps us flexible.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 1):** Safe. There's an apple at (2, 0). If we go down, we are targeting that apple. But it also puts us near the edge.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 2):** Safe. There's an apple at (1, 2). Quick score! Good for an aggressive start.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 2):** Safe. Opens the board to the right.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nThe enemy, Snake #0, is far away (7, 8). They are likely heading toward the apples around (6, 8), (7, 7), or maybe dropping down the middle. We don't need to worry about an immediate collision.\n\nLook at the apple at (1, 2). It's *right there*, a free point on Turn 1! Why wouldn't we take it? Early lead means early psychological warfare, right, Chat? \ud83d\ude0e\n\nIf we move **LEFT** to (1, 2), we snag the apple and grow to length 2.\n*   New Head: (1, 2)\n*   New Body: (2, 2)\n\nThis move is aggressive, secures the first piece of content, and keeps us on the west side of the board, which is relatively open.\n\nLet's check the other paths for comparison.\n*   If we go **UP** to (2, 3), we are safe, but we spend a turn not scoring, just repositioning.\n*   If we go **DOWN** to (2, 1), we set up for (2, 0), but the apples at (0, 1) and (1, 1) are also nearby, and we risk cornering ourselves later.\n\nThe **LEFT** move is the clear winner for Turn 1. Snag the apple, get the point. Let's make some early noise! \ud83d\udd0a\n\n**Long-Term Plan (3-5 Turns):** Establish control on the left side (west board). After eating the apple at (1, 2), we will push toward (1, 1) and (0, 1) to quickly grow our length to 3-4 segments, ensuring we can lock off parts of the middle board later if the enemy tries to cross. Early length is key to boxing him in!\n\nLEFT",

EZ clap! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Current Situation Check:**\n*   **Score:** Us (1 apple), Rival (0 apples). We are winning!\n*   **Our Head:** (1, 2).\n*   **Our Body:** [(2, 2)]. (Note: The tail is currently at (2, 2)).\n*   **Enemy Head (Snake #0):** (8, 8). He's way up in the northeast.\n\n**The Enemy's Likely Move:**\nSnake #0 is at (8, 8). He probably wants to drop down or move left toward the cluster of apples around (7, 7) or (6, 8). Let's assume he went **LEFT** to (7, 8) or **DOWN** to (8, 7). He is still not a threat this turn, but we need to stay aware.\n\n**Our Goal for Turn 1:**\nWe just grew, so we are now length 2. We need to continue dominating the western side of the board and grow quickly. Look at the apples at (1, 1) and (0, 1)! A quick double meal is available!\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (1, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** Safe. Moves us toward an empty space, maintaining flexibility, but no immediate growth.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** **EATS AN APPLE!** This is high priority. It keeps us moving down the west column, setting us up perfectly for (0, 1) or to sweep across the bottom.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** Safe, but this is the board edge. Good for wall-riding, but no apple. Puts us in position to hit (0, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** **SUICIDE!** We would crash into our own body segment at (2, 2). NOPE! We're not throwing that hard, Chat!\n\n**Decision Time:**\n\nGoing **DOWN** to (1, 1) is the clear aggressive play!\n*   We eat the apple! Score goes to 2-0!\n*   Our body grows to length 3.\n*   New Head: (1, 1). New Body: [(1, 2), (2, 2)].\n*   It immediately positions us to attack the apple at (0, 1) next turn if we choose L or D.\n\nThis is exactly what the fans want! Aggressive, focused growth on the path of least resistance. We are forcing the early lead and lengthening our snake to begin dominating space before Snake #0 even realizes what hit him!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (3-5 Turns):**\n1.  Turn 1 (Current): DOWN to (1, 1) for apple.\n2.  Turn 2: Move LEFT to (0, 1) for the third apple, solidifying our control over the entire bottom-left quadrant.\n3.  Turn 3+: Sweep across the bottom or start pushing up the (0, X) column to box off the left side of the map. We want to be long enough to split the board by the time the enemy gets close.\n\nLet's maintain this momentum, Chat! Double the score, double the fun!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, we\u2019re in it: Turn 1, tiny snake, big dreams, enemy already up 1 apple. We cannot take a double-KO right now or we lose on apples, so survival + fast growth + map control is the play.\n\nCurrent positions:\n- Us: head at (8,8), length 1.\n- Enemy: head (1,2), body (2,2), length 2, likely to go grab that juicy apple at (1,1).\n\nWe\u2019re super far apart, so no immediate collision threats. This turn is all about setting up a powerful position for the next few.\n\nLet\u2019s check all four moves:\n\n1) UP \u2192 (8,9)\n   - Safe (on board, no bodies).\n   - But we hug the top wall, reducing future options to basically LEFT/RIGHT next turn.\n   - No apple now, and no immediate apple next turn from that row.\n   - Too passive, too close to wall for no gain.\n\n2) RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)\n   - Safe, but puts us on the right wall.\n   - Next turn: only UP or DOWN (LEFT is backwards into neck, RIGHT is off-board).\n   - One apple nearby at (9,7), but we\u2019re also drifting into the corner, which is terrible long-term for a growing, aggressive snake.\n   - Corners are death traps later; avoid for now.\n\n3) DOWN \u2192 (8,7)\n   - Safe, moves a bit toward center.\n   - Next turn we\u2019d have three options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n   - Two apples in immediate reach next turn: (7,7) and (9,7).\n   - Solid, opens options, decent for growth.\n\n4) LEFT \u2192 (7,8)\n   - Safe, moves us slightly toward center while staying off the top/right walls.\n   - Next turn we have three options (UP, LEFT, DOWN), so lots of flexibility.\n   - Two apples in reach next turn: (6,8) and (7,7).\n   - This also nudges us toward the main apple cluster in the mid-board, and away from the right wall/corner. That\u2019s better for future wrapping routes to box in the enemy from above and the right later.\n\nDOWN vs LEFT is the real choice. Both:\n- Keep us very safe.\n- Give us multiple follow-up moves.\n- Give us two apples to choose from next turn.\n\nThe tiebreaker: map control. LEFT gets us off the right wall vector a bit sooner, keeps us high but more central in x, and sets us up to sweep into that dense apple zone around x=3\u20137, y=4\u20138. That\u2019s where we want to grow big, then later rotate down and in to choke the enemy\u2019s escape routes.\n\nLong-term plan (next few turns):\n- Go LEFT now to (7,8).\n- Then prioritize grabbing one or two of: (6,8), (7,7), (5,7), (6,6), building a thick presence in the upper-middle.\n- Stay away from direct head-on racing lines with the enemy until we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples and length; then we can deliberately threaten a head-on collision they can\u2019t afford.\n- Aim to own the center columns (around x=4\u20137) so that when we finally move down toward them, we can wall off the top and right, forcing them into tighter loops in the bottom-left.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to force anything this turn; we just need the most flexible, growth-friendly position. That\u2019s LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Let's GOOOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n--\n\n**Current Situation Check (Turn 2):**\n\n*   **Score:** Us (2 apples), Rival (0 apples). We are crushing it!\n*   **Our Head:** (1, 1). We are sitting right on that fresh apple scent!\n*   **Our Body:** (1, 2), (2, 2). Length 3.\n*   **Enemy Head (Snake #0):** (7, 8). Holy cow, he's way up in the corner! He didn't even move towards a juicy apple cluster! Maybe he went LEFT or DOWN into empty space, but he's still miles away.\n\n**The Enemy's Position & Potential Moves:**\nSnake #0 is at (7, 8). This is an absolute gift! He's not contesting the bottom half of the board at all.\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n*   LEFT to (6, 8) \u2013 Snags an apple! (6, 8) is an apple spot.\n*   DOWN to (7, 7) \u2013 Snags an apple! (7, 7) is an apple spot.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 8) \u2013 Safe, but strange.\n*   UP to (7, 9) \u2013 Safe, but strange.\n\nIt's highly likely he's gone for one of those apples. Either way, he is still not a factor in our immediate moves. We have free reign down here!\n\n**Our Goal for Turn 2:**\nContinue aggressive growth and dominate the bottom-left corner. We have a golden apple at (0, 1) waiting for us! We need to grow to secure board space before our opponent gets mobile.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (1, 1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 2):** **SUICIDE!** We crash right into our own second segment. NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 0):** Safe, open space. No apple. It pulls us away from the immediate food source at (0, 1).\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Safe, open space. No apple. Might set us up to sweep right, but that feels premature.\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 1):** **EATS AN APPLE!** This is the priority move! It's one step closer to locking down the lower-left quadrant.\n\n**Decision Time:**\n\nGoing **LEFT** to (0, 1) is the no-brainer, aggressive play!\n*   We eat the apple! Score goes to 3-0!\n*   Our body grows to length 4.\n*   New Head: (0, 1). New Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)].\n*   We are now set up to sweep across the bottom (to the apple at (2, 0)) or move straight UP the wall, securing the entire left side.\n\nWe are establishing complete control. The enemy is just feeding us high-quality content! This is a masterclass in early-game positioning, Chat!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (3-5 Turns):**\n1.  Turn 2 (Current): LEFT to (0, 1) for the third apple.\n2.  Turn 3: We will be at (0, 1). We have the apple at (2, 0) nearby, or we can push UP the left wall for maximum board control. Moving DOWN to (0, 0) then RIGHT to (1, 0) then RIGHT to (2, 0) seems safest and keeps us focused on apples. Let's aim to circle the bottom corner and grab (2, 0) next.\n3.  Turn 4/5: After securing the bottom, we start pushing center stage, using our length advantage to pressure Snake #0 when he finally descends.\n\nLet's do this!\n\nLEFT",

No collision risk this turn no matter what we do.\n\nFrom (7,8), check all four moves:\n\n1) UP \u2192 (7,9)\n   - Safe, empty.\n   - No apple.\n   - Keeps us hugging the top wall, which slightly limits future flexibility (only LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN).\n   - Feels too passive: no growth, no major positional gain.\n\n2) RIGHT \u2192 (8,8)\n   - Safe, empty.\n   - No apple this turn, but sets up (9,8) apple next turn.\n   - Moves us back toward the right side; long-term, right wall/corner can be a liability when we\u2019re big and trying to pivot down to trap the opponent.\n   - Also slower tempo on growth compared to taking a free apple now.\n\n3) DOWN \u2192 (7,7)\n   - Safe and there\u2019s an apple at (7,7).\n   - We grow to length 2 and start moving off the top wall toward the central band of the board.\n   - Next turn options from (7,7) with body at (7,8): we can go LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7), or DOWN (7,6). Three safe lanes, good flexibility.\n   - Nice vertical centralization in y, but we stay on the right half of the board in x.\n\n4) LEFT \u2192 (6,8)\n   - Safe and there\u2019s an apple at (6,8).\n   - We grow to length 2, head at (6,8), body at (7,8).\n   - Next turn options from (6,8): UP (6,9), LEFT (5,8), DOWN (6,7) \u2014 again three good lanes.\n   - Moves us slightly toward the horizontal center while still owning the high ground.\n   - Sets us up to farm the dense apple line just below us: (7,7), (5,7), (6,6), (5,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:\n- Both are safe, both give us an apple immediately, both keep multiple good follow-ups.\n- The tiebreaker is long-term control: we want to dominate the upper-middle columns (roughly x=4\u20137) before we drop down to squeeze the enemy from above and the right.\n- LEFT nudges us toward that central x-zone while keeping us on the strong high row. Enemy is stuck in the bottom-left; we can comfortably build a fat body in the top-middle without any contest for several turns.\n\nLong-term plan to future me:\n- Take LEFT now to (6,8), secure that apple and start building mass in the upper-middle.\n- Next few turns: sweep down from around x=5\u20137 into the apple cluster at y=7\u20134, building a wide, flexible shape, not a skinny line.\n- Keep an eye on rotating rightward and downward later to form a horizontal \u201cceiling\u201d over the enemy and vertical \u201cwalls\u201d on their right side.\n- Only consider forcing a head-on collision once we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples/length; until then, farm safely and own the center lanes.\n\nLEFT",

Let's review the current board state and plan the next phase of the BOX!\n\n### Turn 3 Situational Analysis\n\n**The Scoreboard:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 3 apples. Length 4.\n*   Snake #0: 1 apple. Length 2.\nWe have a massive lead! Time to press the advantage and use our length to start controlling the flow!\n\n**Our Position:**\n*   Head: (0, 1) \u2013 We just scooped that tasty apple!\n*   Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)]\n\n**Enemy Position & Likely Move:**\n*   Snake #0 Head: (6, 8).\n*   Snake #0 Body: [(7, 8)] (He did get an apple! Which means he likely moved from (7, 8) to (6, 8) or (7, 8) to (7, 9) or something similar. Wait, let's look at the apple list. Apples near him were (7, 7), (7, 8) (He was on this?), (6, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7). He must have moved into an apple spot to gain a point and body segment!\n*   If his body is currently [(7, 8)], his head must have been *somewhere else* last turn. If his starting head was (7, 8) and he moved to (6, 8) (an apple), his body would be [(7, 8)]. If he moved to (7, 7) (an apple), his body would be [(7, 8)].\n*   Since the Board State shows:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . 0 T . A\n```\nHis head is (6, 8) and his body is (7, 8). He was at (7, 8). He moved **LEFT** to (6, 8) and grabbed an apple! Good on him, he finally got some content!\n*   **Likely moves from (6, 8) for Snake #0:**\n    *   UP to (6, 9) or DOWN to (6, 7): Safe, but no immediate apples.\n    *   LEFT to (5, 8): Safe, open space.\n    *   RIGHT to (7, 8): **SUICIDE!** Hitting his own body segment. Nope!\n\nHe's still isolated and irrelevant to our immediate moves. We are free to set up our strategy in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n### Our Move Selection from (0, 1)\n\nWe are at the wall. We have two main safe options: UP or DOWN. We cannot go LEFT (off-board) or RIGHT (into our own segment (1, 1)).\n\n1.  **LEFT:** **DEATH!** Off the board. (0, 1) -> (-1, 1). NOPE!\n2.  **RIGHT:** **DEATH!** Into our body segment at (1, 1). NOPE!\n3.  **UP to (0, 2):**\n    *   Safe. Keeps us on the wall, securing the left edge of the board.\n    *   No immediate apple, but sets us up perfectly to move toward the center or continue UP to (0, 3), (0, 4), etc., dominating the vertical axis.\n    *   The apple cluster at (3, 7) and (2, 7) is now four moves away. Good potential for future growth.\n4.  **DOWN to (0, 0):**\n    *   Safe. Puts us in the absolute corner.\n    *   Sets up the *perfect* sweep across the bottom to grab the apple at (2, 0).\n    *   Move sequence: (0, 1) -> DOWN (0, 0) -> RIGHT (1, 0) -> RIGHT (2, 0). This locks down the bottom corner and nets us another apple in two turns. A very strong plan for *growth and board control*.\n\n### Decision and Long-Term Strategy\n\nThe primary goal right now is absolute growth and maximizing length before the enemy can descend and challenge the center.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (0, 0) is the superior tactical choice:\n*   It immediately sets up a clear 3-turn plan to grab the apple at (2, 0).\n*   It keeps our body low and out of the way, making it easier to maneuver horizontally.\n*   Once we reach (2, 0), our head will be in a perfect staging area to push UP the middle column (x=2) or continue right.\n\nWe are going to execute the bottom corner circle maneuver, Chat! Let's get that fourth apple!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (3-6 Turns):**\n1.  Turn 3 (Current): DOWN to (0, 0). Lock the corner.\n2.  Turn 4: RIGHT to (1, 0). Open space.\n3.  Turn 5: RIGHT to (2, 0). EAT APPLE! Score 4-1. Length 5.\n4.  Turn 6/7: From (2, 0), push UP towards the apple clusters at (3, 5), (3, 4), and eventually (3, 7). Dominate the vertical line, while the rival is stuck in the north zone.\n\nLet the rival play in the arctic circle; we own the tropics!\n\nDOWN",

Massive tempo option.  \n- Also starts drifting us off the top edge into the juicy mid-band where we can grow into a THICC wall later \ud83d\ude24\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (5,8)**  \n- Inside board \u2705  \n- Cell (5,8) is empty \u2705  \n- New body: [(5,8), (6,8)]  \n- Next-turn options:\n  - UP \u2192 (5,9) empty  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,8) empty  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,7) = apple \ud83c\udf4e  \n- Also solid: 3 good lanes, and moves us toward central columns.  \n- But only **one** immediate-neighbor apple next turn instead of three. Slower scaling.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)**  \n- That\u2019s our own body segment (neck) \u274c  \n- Moving directly backwards is instant throw, we\u2019re not doing that on stream \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo **safe moves**: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \nRIGHT is death, yeet it.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy vs the enemy\n\nEnemy is at (0,1) and can only really go:\n- UP \u2192 (0,2)\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,0)\n\nThey\u2019re pinned bottom-left, we own the ENTIRE top and middle. If we get big enough, we can literally **draw a box around them** and farm their despair \ud83e\udd21\n\nBut right now:\n- They have 3 apples\n- We have 1\n\nWe **cannot** justify forcing future head-on fights until we\u2019re at least even in size. Step 1 is **rapid growth** while staying super flexible.\n\nThat means:\n- Prioritize moves that open **multiple safe follow-ups**\n- Prefer moves that keep us in/near the **central apple cluster**\n- Avoid hugging a wall too long with limited exits\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN vs LEFT vs UP (the real decision)\n\n**UP** is just too passive.  \n- No apple now, no apple next turn guaranteed, and we\u2019re stuck with only two viable directions afterward.  \n- It slows our comeback while the enemy keeps farming bottom apples. Hard pass.\n\n**LEFT** is good, but:  \n- Only one immediate apple neighbor next turn (5,7).  \n- Yes, it pulls us toward center x, which is nice long-term, but the apple tempo is weaker than the alternative.\n\n**DOWN** is cracked this turn:  \n- Keeps 3 follow-up directions open.  \n- Puts us one step into the huge mid-board apple cloud.  \n- Next turn we basically get to *choose* which apple we want out of three different lanes, staying super unpredictable and flexible.  \n- Growing hard right now helps us catch up in score so that later we can confidently threaten those **head-on collision mind games** \ud83d\ude08\n\nWe\u2019re not in danger, we\u2019re not boxed, and we want **maximum future leverage**. That\u2019s **DOWN** all day.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd2e Note to future me (the long-term villain arc)\n\n- Use **DOWN now** to step into the apple ring around y=7\u20135 and power-level our length \ud83d\udcaa  \n- Over the next few turns, chain apples while keeping our structure wide, not a skinny straight line \u2013 we want a **broad body** to act as a moving cage.  \n- Once we\u2019ve bulked up, start shaping a **horizontal \u201cceiling\u201d** above the enemy and a **vertical \u201cwall\u201d** to their right using our body, slowly shrinking their playable space.  \n- When we\u2019re ahead in apples and length, look for lines that bait them into running their head into our body or force a losing head-on. We don\u2019t just win, we **humiliate** \ud83d\ude0f  \n\nDOWN",

We claimed the corner, solidifying our control over the bottom-left quadrant. We are up 3-1 in apples, meaning we are massively longer than this noob rival! Let's get his face in the dirt!\n\n### Turn 4 Situational Analysis\n\n**The Scoreboard Check:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 3 apples (Length 4).\n*   Snake #0: 1 apple (Length 2).\nWe are dominating! Our length is key right now. We need to use it to secure more territory.\n\n**Our Current Position:**\n*   Head: (0, 0). Perfect corner lock!\n*   Body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)].\n\n**Enemy Position & Likely Moves:**\n*   Snake #0 Head: (6, 7). Wait, where did he move? Last turn he was at (6, 8) with body (7, 8). He moved **DOWN** to (6, 7). Smart, somewhat. He is slowly spiraling down the right side.\n*   **Apples near him:** (7, 7) is right next to him. (7, 4) is a bit further.\n*   **Likely moves from (6, 7):**\n    *   RIGHT to (7, 7): Apple grab! Most likely move.\n    *   DOWN to (6, 6): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (5, 7): Safe.\n    *   UP to (6, 8): Safe, but backtracking.\n*   He is still totally isolated from us, focused on collecting his own pathetic little apples on the right side. We have free reign in the South and West.\n\n### Our Move Selection from (0, 0)\n\nWe executed the plan last turn perfectly. Now we are at the bottom corner and need to move RIGHT to continue our sweep toward the highly anticipated apple at (2, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 1):** **DEATH!** We would crash right back into our own body segment (0, 1). NO BACKTRACKING!\n2.  **DOWN to (0, -1):** **DEATH!** Off the board. NOPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 0):** **DEATH!** Off the board. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 0):**\n    *   Safe! This is exactly what we planned.\n    *   Sets up the *next* move to grab the apple at (2, 0).\n    *   Keeps us secure along the bottom wall.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, Chat! We are following the script for maximum growth and board dominance. We need to focus on securing that bottom row before we push north.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (3-6 Turns):\n\n1.  **Turn 4 (Current):** RIGHT to (1, 0). Stage for apple.\n2.  **Turn 5:** RIGHT to (2, 0). EAT APPLE! Score 4-1. Length 5.\n3.  **Turn 6:** From (2, 0), move UP to (2, 1). Start pushing into the vertical control line.\n4.  **Turn 7/8:** Move toward the apple cluster around (3, 5).\n\nWe are using our length lead to grow safely and define the territory. Snake 0 is still just spinning his wheels in the high latitudes.\n\nWe are going RIGHT! Let\u2019s get this apple train moving!\n\nRIGHT",

No head-on risks with us anywhere near (6,7).\n\nNow our options from (6,7):\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,8): that\u2019s our own body (neck). Moving into it = suicide. Illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,7): apple.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,6): apple.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,7): apple.\n\nSo we have **three safe, apple-eating moves**: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. All grow us to length 3, and the enemy cannot interfere this turn.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate each:\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT to (5,7)\n\nAfter move:\n- New snake: head (5,7), body [(6,7), (6,8)].\n\nNext turn possible moves (ignoring apples for a sec):\n- Can\u2019t go RIGHT (back into neck).\n- Legal: UP (5,8), LEFT (4,7), DOWN (5,6) \u2192 all currently empty.\n\nPros:\n- Still 3 safe exits.\n- Moves us a bit toward center (x=5).\n- Close to the big central apple cloud below (4\u20135,5\u20136).\n\nCons:\n- Stays relatively high on the board (y=7).\n- Slightly more \u201cedge-hugging\u201d than necessary.\n- Not quite as central as we could be.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT to (7,7)\n\nAfter move:\n- New snake: head (7,7), body [(6,7), (6,8)].\n\nNext turn:\n- Can\u2019t go LEFT (back into neck).\n- Legal: UP (7,8), RIGHT (8,7), DOWN (7,6) \u2192 all empty.\n\nPros:\n- 3 exits again, fully safe.\n- Lines us up with apples at (9,7) and (9,8).\n\nCons:\n- Drifts us toward the top-right zone.\n- Less central; more likely to end up near the right wall and top wall soon.\n- Central apple cluster (3\u20135,4\u20136) is where the long-term value is; going right chases a smaller cluster (mainly (9,7), (9,8)).\n\nFor boxing the enemy, we generally want to own the **central lanes**, not just the extreme right.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN to (6,6)\n\nAfter move:\n- New snake: head (6,6), body [(6,7), (6,8)].\n\nNext turn:\n- Can\u2019t go UP (back into neck).\n- Legal neighbors:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,6) empty\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,6) empty\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,5) empty\n\nSo again: 3 safe follow-ups.\n\nPositionally:\n- This is the **most central** of all three:\n  - Distance to top: 3\n  - Bottom: 6\n  - Left: 6\n  - Right: 3\n- Drops us right into the thick mid-board band (y=5\u20136) where:\n  - Apples nearby: (4,6), (5,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4).\n  - We have tons of room to fan out horizontally.\n- This is also the perfect staging area to:\n  - Farm central apples aggressively to close the score gap.\n  - Later sweep downward to start building a horizontal \u201cceiling\u201d above the enemy.\n\nCompared to LEFT and RIGHT, DOWN gives:\n- Equal safety this turn.\n- Equal number of future options (3 legal exits).\n- Superior central control and access to the densest apple zone.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term villain plan (next few turns)\n\n- Take **DOWN now** to (6,6) to plant ourselves dead-center in the mid-board.\n- Over coming turns, path through the central apple cluster:\n  - Targets around (4\u20135,4\u20136) to stack length fast and catch up in score.\n- While the enemy is forced to crawl along the bottom row (they\u2019re currently rail-locked to the right), we:\n  - Grow wide, not just long: maintain a broad footprint across columns 4\u20137.\n  - Aim to eventually descend and form:\n    - A horizontal \u201croof\u201d somewhere around y=3\u20134 above them.\n    - A vertical \u201cwall\u201d to their right as we get longer.\n- Only when we\u2019re at or above their apple count do we start actively steering towards potential head-on kill lines; until then, maximum safe growth and board control.\n\nDOWN",

That means we are longer than this clown rival, and that's exactly what we wanted! Massive lead and massive length advantage.\n\n### Turn 5 Situational Analysis\n\n**The Scoreboard Check:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 3 apples (Length 4).\n*   Snake #0: 2 apples (Length 3).\nWait, Snake #0 ate an apple! He was at (6, 7) last turn. He must have moved RIGHT to (7, 7) and grown! We need to stop taking him lightly! He's still focused on the right side of the board.\n\n**Our Current Position:**\n*   Head: (1, 0).\n*   Body: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)].\nWe are perfectly positioned right next to that sweet, sweet apple at (2, 0).\n\n**Enemy Position & Likely Moves:**\n*   Snake #0 Head: (6, 6). Wait, where did he move *from* (7, 7)?\n    *   (7, 7) was the apple. His new head is (6, 6). This means he moved **LEFT to (6, 7)** (which was previously part of his body/tail, but is now free as he moved) and then **DOWN to (6, 6)** in a confusing path *or* he just moved from his last known position *before* the apple eating (7,7) to (6,6).\n    *   Let's assume he was at (7, 7) and he moved:\n        *   DOWN to (7, 6).\n        *   LEFT to (6, 7).\n        *   UP to (7, 8).\n    *   The current board state shows his head at (6, 6) with body segments (6, 7) and (6, 8). This means he was at (7, 7) on Turn 4, ate the apple, and then moved LEFT to (6, 7) and then DOWN to (6, 6)? No, the body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL.\n    *   If his head moved from (6, 7) to (1, 0) and the board state shows: Head (6, 6), Body [(6, 7), (6, 8)].\n    *   Last turn, his head was (6, 7), body [(6, 8)]. He moved to (7, 7) to eat the apple. So his new body is (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8).\n    *   Wait, the scoreboard shows he is now at Head: (6, 6), Body: [(6, 7), (6, 8)]. This means his length is 3. He ate the apple at (7, 7) and shed the tail segment (6, 8) and moved to (6, 6). This means his body is currently incorrect in the Turn 4 Board State display if he ate an apple.\n\nLet's stick to the current state: **Opponent Head at (6, 6). Length 3.**\n*   **Apples near him:** (7, 4) is relatively close. (5, 5) and (4, 4) are also options.\n*   **Likely moves from (6, 6):**\n    *   DOWN to (6, 5): Good pathing.\n    *   LEFT to (5, 6): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (7, 6): Safe.\n    *   UP to (6, 7): **DEATH!** Into his own body segment! He won't do that.\n\nHe is consolidating the center-right. We are consolidating the bottom-left. We are still miles apart, but our next move is CRUCIAL!\n\n### Our Move Selection from (1, 0)\n\nWe are at (1, 0) and need that apple at (2, 0) to solidify our dominance!\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 1):** **DEATH!** This is our body! No way, Chat!\n2.  **DOWN to (1, -1):** **DEATH!** Off the board.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 0):** **DEATH!** This is our body! Backtracking is lethal!\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):**\n    *   **SAFE!**\n    *   **APPLE GRAB!** We increase our score to 4! Our length jumps to 5! We pull ahead even further!\n    *   Secures the entire bottom two rows for us to pivot North later.\n\nThis is a clean, aggressive, and perfectly safe move. We execute the script!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (3-6 Turns):\n\n1.  **Turn 5 (Current):** RIGHT to (2, 0). EAT APPLE! Score 4-2. Length 5.\n2.  **Turn 6:** From (2, 0), move UP to (2, 1) or (3, 0). Pushing UP seems better to secure the wall and prepare for the central cluster around (3, 5). Let's aim UP.\n3.  **Turn 7:** From (2, 1), move UP to (2, 2).\n4.  **Turn 8/9:** Pivot RIGHT along y=2 or y=3 to start encroaching on the enemy's side of the board, using our length as an advantage! We will split the board vertically at the x=5 line.\n\nWe are establishing massive territory control. This rival is getting boxed in, whether he knows it or not! Let's get this apple!\n\nRIGHT",

Solid, pulls us a bit lower toward mid-board.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 RIGHT to (7,6)  \nNew snake: head (7,6), body [(6,6),(6,7)]  \nNext moves:\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6) (neck) \u2192 illegal  \n- UP \u2192 (7,7) apple \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5) empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) empty \u2705  \n\nThree outs next turn, but only one adjacent apple, and it drifts us to the right side, away from where we ultimately want to pressure the enemy (they\u2019re down-left).\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 LEFT to (5,6)  \nNew snake: head (5,6), body [(6,6),(6,7)]  \nNext moves:\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6) (neck) \u2192 illegal  \n- UP \u2192 (5,7) apple \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5) apple \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6) apple \u2705  \n\nThis is JUICY. Next turn we have **three safe exits and all three are apples**. It also pulls us slightly left toward the dense central cluster at (3\u20135, 4\u20136), which is exactly where we want to grow massive and then drop down to cage this dude in.\n\nPositionally:\n- LEFT keeps us mid-height (y=6) and shifts us toward the center-left, right above the enemy\u2019s eventual lane.\n- From there we can chain apples: (5,7), (5,5), (4,6), then further into the 3\u20135 columns.\n- Meanwhile the enemy is stuck crawling along the bottom row; we\u2019ll get big and wide above them.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Strategy note to future me:\n- Go LEFT now to (5,6).\n- Next few turns, prioritize that triple-apple fork: (5,7), (5,5), (4,6) to ramp size and close the score gap.\n- Maintain a wide presence across columns 3\u20137 at y \u2248 4\u20137, then start sliding down to build a horizontal \u201croof\u201d over the enemy around y=3\u20134.\n- Once we\u2019re at least tied or ahead in apples, we can actively hunt for a forced head-on line from above/beside their path.\n\nLEFT",

Our snake is now five segments long, and the enemy is still a measly three segments! We are dominating the bottom of the board, and now it's time to put the squeeze on this fool!\n\n### Turn 6 Situational Analysis\n\n**The Scoreboard Check:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 4 apples (Length 5). Head at (2, 0).\n*   Snake #0: 2 apples (Length 3). Head at (5, 6).\n\n**Enemy Position & Threat Assessment (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (5, 6). Body: [(6, 6), (6, 7)].\n*   The enemy is still centralized in the high-y, mid-x zone. He's got apples near him: (7, 7) (just ate one there, but another appeared!), (5, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (6, 3), and (4, 4). He's surrounded by options.\n*   **Safe Moves for Snake #0:**\n    *   UP to (5, 7): Hits Apple A! Good move for him.\n    *   DOWN to (5, 5): Hits Apple A! Good move for him.\n    *   LEFT to (4, 6): Hits Apple A! Good move for him.\n    *   RIGHT to (6, 6): **DEATH!** Into his body segment. He won't go right.\n*   He is likely going to eat an apple this turn. (5, 7) or (5, 5) seem the most direct ways to stay central while growing. Let's assume he goes for growth/apples, as he is currently behind.\n\n**Our Current Position & Goals:**\n*   Head: (2, 0). Body: [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)].\n*   We have completely secured the bottom-left corner. We need to move North-East to start cutting off the board and threatening the enemy.\n*   The overall strategy is to construct a dividing wall (e.g., along x=3 and x=4) and then either trap him against the wall or force him into a head-on collision where our length advantage (5 vs 3) is key.\n\n### Move Selection from (2, 0)\n\n1.  **DOWN to (2, -1):** **DEATH!** Off the grid. No way, Chat.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 0):** **DEATH!** Body segment.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 0):**\n    *   **SAFE!** Moves us East. Keeps us low for now, prepping for a wall.\n4.  **UP to (2, 1):**\n    *   **SAFE!** Brings us North, which is our ultimate goal for board control. Closer to the central action.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (RIGHT vs. UP):**\n\nWe need to establish a strong northern path quickly. Moving RIGHT to (3, 0) is safe, but it's slow progress toward the center. Moving UP to (2, 1) keeps our established boundary solid and starts our vertical push. Since there are no immediate threats or apples at (3, 0) or (2, 1), we prioritize the move that sets up the best vertical defense and future horizontal cuts.\n\n*   By moving UP, we position ourselves perfectly to move UP again (to 2, 2) and then start building the wall around x=3 or x=4.\n\nWe need to make distance quickly and get involved in the middle of the board. UP is the direction of aggression and expansion. Let's start the upward spiral of doom for Snake #0!\n\nWe are not at risk of a head-on collision, as we are five squares away and perpendicular to his current location. We are controlling our space perfectly.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (3-6 Turns):**\n\n1.  **Turn 6 (Current):** UP to (2, 1). Maintain solid ground.\n2.  **Turn 7:** UP to (2, 2). Continue expansion.\n3.  **Turn 8:** Move RIGHT to (3, 2). Secure the x=3 line. We are looking at the huge apple clump between x=3 and x=5. Our goal is to intersect the enemy's path and cut him off from the left side of the board.\n4.  **Turn 9/10:** Continue to (3, 3) or (4, 2) to start eating the apples at (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5).\n\nChat, the domination continues! UP we go!\n\nUP",

Smart move by the opponent, but we expected him to focus on growth.\n*   **Immediate Apples for Snake #0:**\n    *   (3, 7) - UP and LEFT is a juicy target.\n    *   (3, 5) - DOWN and LEFT.\n    *   (4, 5) - DOWN.\n    *   (5, 7) - UP and RIGHT.\n*   **Most Likely Moves for Snake #0 from (4, 6):**\n    1.  **UP to (4, 7):** Safe, but no apple. Leads toward (3, 7).\n    2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** HITS APPLE A! This is a high-probability move. He gets length 5, tying us up.\n    3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe. Leads toward (3, 7) or (3, 5).\n    4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** **DEATH!** Into his own body. He won't make this mistake, chat!\n*   If he moves DOWN to (4, 5), he ties our score, but he's also driving himself into a crowded area, which is great for us, as our body is far away.\n\n**Our Current Position & Goals:**\n*   Head: (2, 1). Body: [(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)].\n*   We executed the \"UP\" move perfectly last turn. Now we are poised to strike into the mid-board.\n*   The overall strategy remains: **CROSSED THE LINE!** We need to advance quickly along the x=2/x=3 corridor and build a wall across the board, cutting off Snake #0 from the valuable left side.\n\n### Move Selection from (2, 1)\n\n1.  **DOWN to (2, 0):** **DEATH!** Into our own body segment. No way, Chat!\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 1):** Safe. Keeps us tight against the wall. A defensive move.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 1):** Safe. Immediately starts our push toward the center (x=3). No apple, but excellent positioning.\n4.  **UP to (2, 2):** Safe. Continues our vertical expansion. Keeps the pressure on.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (LEFT vs. RIGHT vs. UP):**\n\nWe are far enough away from Snake #0 (4 squares X distance, 5 squares Y distance) that a head-on collision is impossible this turn. We need to maximize our strategic push.\n\n*   **LEFT (1, 1):** Too passive. We want blood!\n*   **RIGHT (3, 1):** This is a strong move. It establishes us on the X=3 line, setting up moves toward the lucrative apple cluster (3, 4), (3, 5), and (3, 7). It costs us a turn of vertical progress, but makes up for it in horizontal reach.\n*   **UP (2, 2):** Also a very strong move. It means we can hit (3, 2) next turn, or continue up to (2, 3) where Apple A (3, 4) is very close. This maintains the direct line of attack.\n\nGiven that the enemy is moving around (4, 6), we want to get into the space around X=3 and Y=4/5 before he does.\n\nLet's look at the optimal path for establishing the wall:\n*   If we go **RIGHT to (3, 1)**: Next turn we can go UP to (3, 2), then (3, 3), then (3, 4) (APPLE!). This is fast horizontal and vertical advance.\n*   If we go **UP to (2, 2)**: Next turn we can go RIGHT to (3, 2), then (3, 3), then (3, 4) (APPLE!). This achieves the same goal, just swapping the order of the first two crucial turns.\n\nThe advantage of going UP first (to 2, 2) is that it pulls our long tail further up the side wall, maximizing the space we control in the bottom-left corner *before* we commit to the interior of the board. It maintains the vertical boundary we've established.\n\nLet's stick to the plan from last turn: UP to (2, 2), establishing presence, and then we pivot RIGHT. This keeps our options open and delays the move into the open field by one turn, which is safer.\n\nUP it is, Chat! We are marching North! Get ready for the cutoff!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (3-6 Turns):\n\n1.  **Turn 7 (Current):** UP to (2, 2). Secure the vertical line.\n2.  **Turn 8:** RIGHT to (3, 2). Start the horizontal cut. Check for threats from Snake #0.\n3.  **Turn 9:** UP to (3, 3). Continue pushing up the x=3 line.\n4.  **Turn 10:** UP to (3, 4) (APPLE!). Confirm the board dominance!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! Turn 8 is LIVE, and we are tied up on the scoreboard, four apples apiece! This is where the real strategy kicks in! We gotta take the lead back and box this fool in!\n\n### Turn 8 Situational Analysis: We are Positioning for the Cut!\n\n**The Scoreboard Check:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 4 apples (Length 5). Head at (2, 2).\n*   Snake #0: 4 apples (Length 5). Head at (4, 5). He moved down from (4, 6) last turn to snag the apple at (4, 5), tying the score and increasing his length! Smart play, but now he's committed to the lower-mid board.\n\n**Enemy Position & Threat Assessment (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (4, 5). Body: [(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)]. Look at that body structure! It's blocking off the right side of the board for him. It's a wall, but a weak one.\n*   **Immediate Apples for Snake #0:**\n    *   (3, 5) - LEFT. This is a very tempting apple.\n    *   (5, 5) - RIGHT. Also a very tempting apple.\n    *   (3, 7) - UP and LEFT.\n*   **Most Likely Moves for Snake #0 from (4, 5):**\n    1.  **UP to (4, 6):** **DEATH!** Into his own body. No way he makes that blunder if he's paying attention.\n    2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):** HITS APPLE A! High probability move. He gets length 6, pushing ahead.\n    3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):** HITS APPLE A! High probability move. He gets length 6, and starts hugging the X=3 line, exactly where we want to be.\n    4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** HITS APPLE A! High probability move. He gets length 6, and moves toward the center, but he's getting cramped by his own tail (5, 6).\n*   He has three very strong moves that lead to apples. If he goes LEFT to (3, 5), it positions him directly in our path to the cluster! This is the most dangerous scenario for us.\n\n**Our Current Position & Goals:**\n*   Head: (2, 2). Body: [(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)].\n*   We committed to the UP move last turn, reaching (2, 2) and pulling our tail nicely up the left edge.\n*   **Our primary goal: Advance into the X=3 corridor and start building the wall to cut him off from the left side of the board (and the cluster of apples at (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7)).**\n\n### Move Selection from (2, 2)\n\n1.  **DOWN to (2, 1):** **DEATH!** We just came from there. Not a chance, Chat!\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 2):** Safe. Too passive. This backs us into the corner we just escaped.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 2):** Safe. This is the calculated move! It establishes our presence on the X=3 line, exactly as planned. It moves toward the apple cluster.\n4.  **UP to (2, 3):** Safe. Keeps us on the X=2 line. A good position, but delays the horizontal cut we need to make. (3, 4) is an apple, so (2, 3) is a strong staging area for (3, 3) next turn.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (RIGHT vs. UP):**\n\nWe are trying to get to the X=3 line to block access to the left. Our primary target is the (3, 4) apple.\n\n*   If we go **UP to (2, 3)**:\n    *   Next turn: We can go RIGHT to (3, 3).\n    *   Turn after: UP to (3, 4) (APPLE!).\n    *   This is a very safe, apple-oriented path.\n\n*   If we go **RIGHT to (3, 2)**:\n    *   Next turn: We can go UP to (3, 3).\n    *   Turn after: UP to (3, 4) (APPLE!).\n    *   This is the same result, but we gain the X=3 line one turn sooner.\n\nWhy does getting to X=3 *now* matter? Because Snake #0 is at (4, 5) and might move LEFT to (3, 5).\n\n*   If Snake #0 goes LEFT to (3, 5): He is now two squares ahead of us vertically (Y=5 vs. Y=2), but now we are right below him.\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (3, 2)**, we are three squares away from him (Y=5 vs. Y=2).\n*   If we move **UP to (2, 3)**, we are two squares away horizontally, and two away vertically.\n\nThe key is that if Snake #0 goes to (3, 5) this turn, and we go **RIGHT to (3, 2)**, we are perfectly positioned to continue UP to (3, 3) next turn and then hit the apple at (3, 4). If we go **UP to (2, 3)**, we have to move RIGHT to (3, 3) next turn, which is less direct toward the goal apple (3, 4) if he is already sitting above us at (3, 5).\n\nBy moving **RIGHT** now, we immediately start the wall and force him to react to our presence on the X=3 line. We prioritize board domination over the strict shortest path to the next apple. We're getting aggressive, Chat! We need to meet him in the middle and cut him off.\n\nThe move is RIGHT. We execute the second step of the planned maneuver: establish the X=3 barrier!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (3-6 Turns):\n\n1.  **Turn 8 (Current):** RIGHT to (3, 2). Secure the X=3 line.\n2.  **Turn 9:** UP to (3, 3). Continue pushing up the corridor. Watch for Snake #0 at (3, 5) or (4, 4).\n3.  **Turn 10:** UP to (3, 4) (APPLE!). Get the lead back and gain length.\n4.  **Turn 11:** UP to (3, 5) (or circle to (4, 5) to follow Snake #0's potential path). Start boxing him in from the bottom left.\n\nRIGHT",

Directly backwards into our own body = instant death.  \n  \u2192 Illegal.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,5)**  \n  - Cell (3,5) has an apple.  \n  - Not our body, not enemy body.  \n  - Enemy from (2,2) can go to (2,3),(1,2),(3,2); none hit (3,5).  \n  - New body: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7)] (length 6).  \n  \u2192 Safe, grows, and leaves 3 future outs (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,5)**  \n  - Cell (5,5) has an apple.  \n  - Not our body, not enemy body.  \n  - Enemy can\u2019t reach (5,5) next move.  \n  - New body: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7)].  \n  - Next turn from (5,5): RIGHT (6,5) and DOWN (5,4) are safe; UP/LEFT are into our own body/neck.  \n  \u2192 Safe, grows, but only **2** good future moves.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,4)**  \n  - Cell (4,4) has an apple.  \n  - Not our body, not enemy body.  \n  - Enemy can\u2019t reach (4,4) this turn.  \n  - New body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7)].  \n  - Next turn from (4,4): LEFT (3,4, apple), RIGHT (5,4), DOWN (4,3) all open.  \n  \u2192 Safe, grows, and keeps **3** strong future options.\n\nSo:  \n- Unsafe: **UP**  \n- Safe & apple: **LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN**\n\n### 2) Which safe apple is best?\n\nWe want:\n- Growth (to pull ahead in apples),\n- Central control,\n- Lots of future options to start building a \u201croof\u201d over the enemy.\n\nCompare:\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,5)**  \n  - Only 2 good moves next turn (RIGHT, DOWN).  \n  - Slightly more cramped; we\u2019re boxed by our own body on two sides immediately.\n\n- **LEFT to (3,5)**  \n  - 3 good moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n  - Keeps us at y=5, above the enemy, but delays starting our horizontal \u201cceiling\u201d at y\u22484.\n\n- **DOWN to (4,4)**  \n  - 3 good moves next turn (LEFT to apple (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), DOWN to (4,3)).  \n  - Keeps us central at x=4.  \n  - Starts occupying row 4, which is exactly where we want a \u201croof\u201d line to eventually box the enemy under us.  \n  - Still two full rows between us and their head (they\u2019re at y=2), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nAll three keep us safe this turn, all three give us an apple, but **DOWN** both maximizes future flexibility and starts building that mid-board barrier we want while we edge ahead in score.\n\n### Strategy note for future me\n\n- After going **DOWN to (4,4)** and grabbing the apple, prioritize:\n  - **LEFT to (3,4)** next (another apple) to begin a horizontal band around y=4, or\n  - **RIGHT to (5,4)** if we want to stretch our \u201croof\u201d toward the right side.\n- Stay roughly in rows 4\u20136 for a few turns, growing and spreading horizontally, so we can later drop a tighter ceiling at y=3\u20134 that the enemy has to crawl under.\n- Keep avoiding direct head-on lines until we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples; once we\u2019ve got a solid lead and a thick body, then we can start threatening head-ons to bully them into our walls.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back! Turn 9 is officially upon us, and we are right where we wanted to be! We just executed the first part of the barrier strategy by moving **RIGHT** to (3, 2). Let's see what the enemy, Snake #0, did!\n\n### Turn 9 Situational Analysis: The Barrier is UP!\n\n**The Scoreboard Check:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 4 apples (Length 5). Head is now at **(3, 2)**.\n*   Snake #0: 5 apples (Length 6). Head is now at **(4, 4)**. He's up 1 apple!\n\n**Enemy Action Review (Snake #0):**\n*   Last turn, Snake #0's head was at (4, 5). He moved **DOWN** to (4, 4) and ate an apple! Smart move, but predictable. He gained length and stayed put in the center-mid, refusing to commit to the dangerous X=3 line where we are!\n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 4). **Body:** [(4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)].\n*   **Current Threat:** He's well-positioned to strike the apples at (3, 4) and (5, 5). He still has two safe, tempting apple moves: **LEFT** to (3, 4) (APPLE!) or **RIGHT** to (5, 4) (which is empty, then maybe to (5, 5) for the apple).\n\n**Our Action Review and Goal Reaffirmation:**\n*   **Our Head:** (3, 2). **Body:** [(2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)].\n*   **Goal:** Continue pushing up the X=3 corridor to secure the (3, 4) and (3, 5) apples, and to use our body as a wall against Snake #0. We need to catch up on apples!\n\n### Move Selection from (3, 2)\n\nWe must continue our vertical advance!\n\n1.  **DOWN to (3, 1):** Safe, but retreats from the battle and delays getting the apple. Too passive. We are here to dominate!\n2.  **LEFT to (2, 2):** **DEATH!** Into our own neck. Absolutely not, Chat!\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** Safe. Moves toward the center, but gives up the tactical advantage we just earned by securing the X=3 line.\n4.  **UP to (3, 3):** Safe and on strategy! This maintains our position on the X=3 line and puts us one step closer to the apple at (3, 4).\n\n**Analyzing the UP move (3, 3):**\n\nThis is the key move. It puts us directly on the path to the apple at (3, 4).\n\n*   **Will Snake #0 interfere?** Snake #0 is at (4, 4).\n    *   If Snake #0 goes **LEFT** to (3, 4) (APPLE!): This would put him on the apple, and we would be at (3, 3). He gets ahead in length, but we are right on his tail, ready to box him in.\n    *   If Snake #0 goes **DOWN** to (4, 3): He avoids confrontation.\n    *   If Snake #0 goes **RIGHT** to (5, 4): He moves toward the (5, 5) apple.\n\n**The Head-to-Head Clash Scenario (Apple at (3, 4)):**\nIf Snake #0 goes LEFT to (3, 4), and we go UP to (3, 3), he takes the apple. We are then perfectly positioned to go UP to (3, 4) next turn, putting massive pressure on his tail at (4, 5) or on his options for movement toward the left wall.\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 3), we are guaranteed a safe move, and we put ourselves in position to get the apple on Turn 10, *unless* he takes it. Even if he takes it, our positioning is fantastic for boxing him out of the left half.\n\nIf we went RIGHT instead to (4, 2), we give up the X=3 line and he is free to exploit the (3, Y) apples with little resistance. We cannot give him that space!\n\n**The immediate action is clear: continue the UPward push. Secure (3, 3), then secure the apple at (3, 4) next turn. We need to be aggressive and close the gap on the scoreboard!**\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (3-6 Turns):\n\n1.  **Turn 9 (Current):** UP to (3, 3). Continue establishing the barrier.\n2.  **Turn 10:** UP to (3, 4) (APPLE!). If Snake #0 took it, we establish a wall right behind him. If he didn't, we take the lead or tie, and gain length!\n3.  **Turn 11:** Secure (3, 5) (APPLE!) or move toward the clustered apples further up at (3, 7).\n4.  **Turn 12+:** Use the long body we are acquiring to cut off Snake #0's escape routes to the left and force him into crowded areas on the right side of the board. Box him, Chat! Box him!\n\nUP",

Instant self-bonk \ud83d\udc80  \n  \u21d2 **ILLEGAL**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,3)**  \n  - Board shows (4,3) is empty.  \n  - Enemy from (3,2) can move to: (3,3), (3,1), (4,2). None are (4,3).  \n  - No body there, no border, no simultaneous head clash.  \n  \u21d2 **Safe**, but no apple, and moves us closer to direct brawling.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,4)**  \n  - That square has an apple \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - Not our body, not enemy body.  \n  - Enemy can\u2019t reach (3,4) this turn from (3,2).  \n  - New body if we go LEFT (we grow):  \n    (3,4),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7)  \n  - That puts us **directly above** the enemy column, starting a **horizontal wall on row 4**.  \n  \u21d2 **Safe + apple + great position for boxing.**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,4)**  \n  - Empty square, no body, no border.  \n  - Enemy can\u2019t get there this turn.  \n  - New body: (5,4),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7)  \n  - Safe, but no apple, and pulls us **away** from the enemy lane, making it easier for them to sneak up the left side.  \n  \u21d2 **Safe but passive.**\n\nSo surviving options: **LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN**. UP is suicide.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Which safe move is actually GOOD?\n\nWe care about:\n- Staying alive (duh),\n- Grabbing apples to extend our lead,\n- Shaping the board to **box the enemy under us**.\n\nCompare:\n\n- **RIGHT (5,4)**  \n  - Safe, decent future outs (UP to (5,5), DOWN, RIGHT).  \n  - But we drift **right**, leaving a big open corridor on the left for them to climb out.  \n  - No apple = we stay 5\u20134 instead of stretching the lead.\n\n- **DOWN (4,3)**  \n  - Safe and aggressive (brings us into the same band as the enemy).  \n  - But we **drop off the \u201croof\u201d level** (row 4) before we\u2019ve finished building it.  \n  - Also gives more chances for chaotic head-on situations next couple turns when our lead is only +1.\n\n- **LEFT (3,4)**  \n  - Safe AND eats an apple \u2192 score becomes **6\u20134**.  \n  - Extends our control **horizontally across row 4**, directly above enemy\u2019s column (x\u22482\u20133).  \n  - Next turn, no matter which way enemy moves:\n    - We\u2019ll have at least 2 safe follow-ups (UP and/or LEFT, sometimes DOWN too).\n  - Strategically, this is exactly the \u201cceiling\u201d line we started planning last turn: row 4 as the barrier between them and the juicy top half.\n\nThis is the dream: **grow, centralize, and tighten the roof** while they\u2019re still stuck around y=1\u20133.\n\nSo we snap-LOCK it in: **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy note for future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- After moving to **(3,4)**:\n  - We\u2019ll be up **6\u20134** in apples. That\u2019s a real lead; we can start looking for **favorable collision threats** soon.\n  - Priorities:\n    1. Keep extending / thickening the **row-4 barrier** near x=2\u20134 (e.g., LEFT to (2,4) or UP to (3,5) depending on enemy movement).\n    2. Don\u2019t let them freely climb up the left edge\u2014be ready to slide left and then up to cut off lanes.\n    3. Once our body is nice and chunky and they\u2019re squeezed below/near a wall, start angling for a forced **head-on where they have no escape**. With a 2+ apple lead, a mutual KO still wins us the game.\n- Always keep at least **2 safe escapes** open for ourselves while we build the box. No ego deaths, only calculated murders \ud83d\ude0e.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back for Turn 10! The pressure is ON! We just made the strategic move UP to (3, 3), keeping us solid on the X=3 domination line! Let's check the board and see how we can finish boxing this guy in!\n\n### Turn 10 Situational Analysis: The Stranglehold Begins!\n\n**The Scoreboard Check:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 4 apples (Length 5). Head is at **(3, 3)**.\n*   Snake #0: 6 apples (Length 7). Head is at **(3, 4)**. He's up 2 apples and 2 body segments!\n\n**Enemy Action Review (Snake #0):**\n*   Last turn, Snake #0's head was at (4, 4). He moved **LEFT** to (3, 4) and ATE THE APPLE! Ugh, he beat us to the punch by one turn, pushing his lead to 2!\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 4). **Body:** [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)].\n*   **Current Threat:** He is now directly NORTH of us! We are at (3, 3) and he is at (3, 4). This is the perfect confrontation! He has effectively cornered himself between his own body (at 4, 4) and our head (at 3, 3). His movement is SEVERELY restricted.\n\n**Our Action Review and Goal Reaffirmation:**\n*   **Our Head:** (3, 3). **Body:** [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)].\n*   **Goal:** Secure the next apple at (3, 5) or FORCE a decision from Snake #0 that leads to his demise. Since he is directly above us, we must maintain the pressure!\n\n### Move Selection from (3, 3)\n\nWe have to choose our move carefully. Snake #0 at (3, 4) can move: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. DOWN is into our head!\n\n**Our safe moves from (3, 3):**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (3, 2):** Safe. Moves back over our own body part. Retreats from the conflict. Too passive when we have him trapped. Bad move, Chat!\n2.  **LEFT to (2, 3):** Safe. Moves us away from the conflict, but opens up the path for him to move DOWN into (3, 3) next turn, which is still dangerous for him, but less immediate pressure.\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):** Safe. Moves us around the corner of the confrontation zone. Puts us safely adjacent to his long body mass, ready to move into the center.\n4.  **UP to (3, 4):** **DEATH!** Head-on collision or collision into his body! Both our heads are moving simultaneously. If we move UP to (3, 4) and he moves:\n    *   **LEFT to (2, 4):** We hit his body at (3, 4) (which is empty after he moves LEFT). Wait, no... if we both move, the head at (3, 4) moves, leaving (3, 4) empty.\n    *   **HEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK:** If we both aim for the **SAME SPOT**, we both die. If we move UP to (3, 4), we are moving into the spot he *just left*. This is **SAFE**, assuming he moves away from (3, 4).\n    *   *But wait!* If he moves UP to (3, 5) (APPLE!): We move UP to (3, 4). We gain length and maintain direct chase pressure. This is a great outcome!\n    *   If he moves LEFT to (2, 4): We move UP to (3, 4). We gain length, and cut him off from the center! This is an AMAZING outcome! He is now pressed against the X=2 line.\n    *   If he moves RIGHT to (4, 4): He moves into his own body at (4, 4)! **SNAKE #0 DIES!** (His tail is currently at (6, 7). His body is: (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)). If he moves RIGHT, he moves from (3, 4) to (4, 4). That is his body! **He cannot move RIGHT!**\n\n**AHA! SNAKE #0 CANNOT MOVE RIGHT TO (4, 4)!**\n\nThis is HUGE, chat! His safe moves are: UP to (3, 5) (Apple) or LEFT to (2, 4).\n\n**Re-evaluating Our Move: UP to (3, 4) - The Aggressive Play!**\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 4), we are guaranteed to take the spot he *leaves* this turn. We collect no apple, but we gain the ultimate dominant position!\n\n*   **Scenario A: He moves UP to (3, 5) (Apple).**\n    *   We move UP to (3, 4). Score: He gets an apple (7/4). Length: He is 8, we are 6.\n    *   **Next Turn:** We are at (3, 4), he is at (3, 5). We are on his tail, forcing him to keep moving UP toward the wall or LEFT/RIGHT without crossing our X=3 barrier. The pressure is maximum!\n*   **Scenario B: He moves LEFT to (2, 4).**\n    *   We move UP to (3, 4). We gain length (5/4).\n    *   **Next Turn:** He is now completely cut off from the main board! He is at (2, 4), we are at (3, 4). His only safe moves are UP to (2, 5) or maybe LEFT to (1, 4). We have completely boxed him against the left wall! GGs!\n\n**Is there any reason to NOT move UP?**\n\n*   If we move LEFT to (2, 3): He moves UP to (3, 5). We lose the high-ground position and let him escape.\n*   If we move RIGHT to (4, 3): He moves UP to (3, 5). Same result.\n\n**The plan is clear: We move UP, we take his spot, and we leverage the fact that he CANNOT move into (4, 4) to box him in!** The pressure must be absolute! We cannot let him safely move away from the X=3 line.\n\nWe will move **UP** to (3, 4)! This is the most aggressive and advantageous strategic move, regardless of which of his two safe directions he chooses. We secure the critical bottleneck space!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (3-6 Turns):\n\n1.  **Turn 10 (Current):** UP to (3, 4). Force Snake #0 to either proceed to the (3, 5) apple or move LEFT into the dead zone.\n2.  **Turn 11 (If he went UP to 3, 5):** Move UP to (3, 5) (APPLE!). We tie or pull ahead in length and continue pushing him to the top wall. We will then dominate the entire left half of the board.\n3.  **Turn 11 (If he went LEFT to 2, 4):** Move LEFT to (2, 4) (CRUSH HIM!). We immediately move to cut him off, or we can move UP to (3, 5) (APPLE!) to gain length and secure the center, forcing him to move down the left wall. We use our body to dominate the (3, Y) column.\n\nThis is a high-stakes, high-reward move, Chat! We are going for the *W*!\n\nUP",

Time to crank the pressure without throwing.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Run the options: UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT\n\nFrom our head **(3,4)**:\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 RIGHT \u2192 (4,4)\n- That\u2019s literally our own neck: segment at (4,4).\n- Moving directly backwards into our body is instant self-bonk \u2620\ufe0f  \n\ud83d\udc49 **RIGHT is ILLEGAL.**\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 DOWN \u2192 (3,3)\n- That\u2019s where the enemy head is *right now*.\n- Remember: when snakes move, the **old enemy head (3,3)** becomes part of their body on the new turn.\n- Enemy\u2019s legal moves from (3,3):  \n  - UP \u2192 (3,4)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,3)  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)  \n- If we go **DOWN \u2192 (3,3)** and they go:\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (2,3)**: after movement, their body includes (3,3).  \n    \u2192 Our head lands on their body \u21d2 **we die, they live** \ud83d\udc80  \n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)**: same story, their body again includes (3,3).  \n    \u2192 **We die, they live.**\n  - **UP \u2192 (3,4)**: both heads end up on opponent body squares \u21d2 **double KO**, and we\u2019d win on apples\u2026  \n    \u2026but they\u2019re behind 4\u20136, so they\u2019ll NEVER choose a move that guarantees a loss if a winning option exists.\n\ud83d\udc49 **DOWN is SUICIDE vs a rational opponent. HARD NO.**\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 LEFT \u2192 (2,4)\n- Board check: (2,4) is empty, no apple, no body.\n- Our new body would be:  \n  (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n- This extends our \u201croof\u201d on row 4 to a **solid wall at x=2,3,4**:\n  - (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) all ours \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy options vs this move:\n  - **UP \u2192 (3,4)**: their head slams into our body \u21d2 they die, we live \u2705\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (2,3)** or **RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)**: both are safe for them, no collision.\n- So for us: **always safe**, sometimes we even kill them if they troll into us.\n\ud83d\udc49 **LEFT is SAFE, very good for building the wall, but no apple.**\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 UP \u2192 (3,5)\n- (3,5) currently has an \ud83c\udf4e.\n- Not our body, not their body, in-bounds.\n- If we move UP and eat:\n  - New body:  \n    (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7)  \n    We grow to length 8, score becomes **7\u20134** \ud83d\ude24\n- Enemy responses vs our UP:\n  - **UP \u2192 (3,4)**: they move their head into our second segment (3,4) \u21d2 **they die, we live**.\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (2,3)**: new enemy body at {(2,3),(3,3),(3,2),(2,2),(2,1)}  \n    \u2192 Our head at (3,5) nowhere near that \u21d2 both snakes alive.\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)**: same idea, no collision.\n- So they\u2019ll rationally avoid UP (instant suicide) and go LEFT or RIGHT.\n\ud83d\udc49 **UP is 100% SAFE for us and grabs a free apple.**\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 UP vs LEFT: which is actually better for the clamp? \ud83e\udd14\n\nBoth **UP** and **LEFT** are safe. So we compare:\n\n#### If we go LEFT \u2192 (2,4)\n- Pros:\n  - Immediate **3-wide hard wall** on row 4: (2,4),(3,4),(4,4).\n  - Enemy is stuck under that and must escape around the **sides**.\n- Cons:\n  - No apple \u2192 we stay at **6\u20134**, only +2.\n  - Our head stays at y=4, slightly less vertical reach for the next turn.\n  - Future from (2,4): our safe moves are basically **UP** and **LEFT** (DOWN risks enemy), so still only ~2 good outs.\n\n#### If we go UP \u2192 (3,5)\n- Pros:\n  - We eat the apple \u2192 **score becomes 7\u20134**.  \n    Now we\u2019re +3, which is HUGE for threatening future head-ons \ud83d\udca5\n  - Our body still forms a strong roof right above the enemy:\n    - Row 4: (3,4),(4,4) are ours.\n    - We\u2019re now at (3,5), stacked right on top of that.\n  - Next turn from (3,5), our safe directions:\n    - **LEFT \u2192 (2,5)** (toward boxing them from the left side),\n    - **UP \u2192 (3,6)** (toward more apples and high ground).\n  - We\u2019re more central in the upper mid, ready to hoover up top apples while they\u2019re still stuck low.\n- Cons:\n  - We don\u2019t instantly close the gap at (2,4); they can try to slip up via x=2 next turn.\n  - But we can respond by sliding **LEFT to (2,5)**, then work down/around to seal that flank while staying way more massive.\n\nGiven:\n- Our #1 job: **don\u2019t die** \u2705\n- Then: **grow and dominate multi-turn space** \u2705\n- And we\u2019ve got a **free apple** that doesn\u2019t compromise safety\u2026\n\nWhy not take the apple AND keep the pressure? We still have a strong roof, and we can always extend the wall leftward next turn from a stronger, taller position.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **UP is the best mix of safety, growth, and long-term board control.**\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term game plan for FUTURE ME \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\nYo future me, remember this:\n\n1. **After this move, we\u2019re at 7\u20134.**  \n   - With a 3-apple lead, a **forced double-KO is totally winning** for us if it ever becomes unavoidable.\n   - So don\u2019t fear head-ons later if they\u2019re cornered and have no escape.\n\n2. **Play from the high ground.**\n   - From (3,5), look to:\n     - Slide **LEFT to (2,5)** to threaten that left escape lane if they start climbing.\n     - Or go **UP to (3,6)** and then toward the fat apple cluster at the top (3,7),(5,5),(5,7),(7,7),(9,7),(9,8).\n   - Idea: while they\u2019re trapped in the bottom-left, we farm top-center/right and turn into a massive concrete snake wall.\n\n3. **Box first, kill second.**\n   - Use our long body to make a **thick band around y\u22484\u20136** across the board.\n   - Force their path into a narrow corridor near a wall.\n   - Then look for a turn where:\n     - Every enemy move is either:  \n       - head-on into us (double KO we win), or  \n       - straight into our body (they die alone).\n   - Don\u2019t rush the KO. Bigger snake = more control = easier forced loss for them.\n\n4. **Always leave at least two clean escape routes for us.**\n   - No ego plays where we corner THEM but also corner OURSELVES.\n   - We win by being the last braincell on the board, not the fastest kamikaze.\n\nAlright chat, we\u2019re taking the free value and climbing the ladder. Let\u2019s go UP, eat, and keep this dude in the basement. \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",
