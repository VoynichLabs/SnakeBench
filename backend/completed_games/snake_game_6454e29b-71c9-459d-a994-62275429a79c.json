          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! Turn 0, we're fresh off the starting line, and my archrival, Snake #0, is lurking! We've got a 10x10 board, and it's time to plot the ultimate box-in! Are we going for the early aggression or setting up the long-game squeeze? Let's check the map!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head (ID 1):** (1, 0) - Bottom left corner, great starting position!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (3, 1) - Slightly above and to my right.\n*   **Apples:** I see a cluster up high and some scattered around. The closest visible apple is at (4, 3) or maybe (1, 6).\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\nTurn 1 is all about securing safe territory and getting separation or strategic positioning. Since we are both length 1, an early head-to-head collision (if we move into the same cell) is a double KO. We want to avoid that unless we can force him into our territory later. Right now, we focus on safe expansion.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (1, 0):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 1):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes. Not off-board, no body segments (I'm length 1).\n    *   **Pros:** Moves me towards the center/action.\n    *   **Enemy Counterplay:** Where is Snake 0 going? Snake 0 is at (3, 1). If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (2, 1) or DOWN to (3, 0), we are still far apart. If 0 moves UP to (3, 2) or RIGHT to (4, 1), we are also safe. This seems extremely safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, -1):**\n    *   **Safe?** No! Off the board (y < 0). **ELIMINATED.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 0):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Secures the corner, giving me a strong wall position.\n    *   **Cons:** Limits immediate future moves (only UP is safe from (0, 0)).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves me closer to the enemy's side of the board but maintains separation in the first turn.\n    *   **Cons:** Possibly gives the enemy more centralization if they move up or left.\n\n**Considering Enemy Position (3, 1):**\nSnake 0 has many options:\n*   UP (3, 2): Good move, centralizing.\n*   DOWN (3, 0): Good move, securing lower territory.\n*   LEFT (2, 1): Moves towards my general area.\n*   RIGHT (4, 1): Moves towards the first visible apple at (4, 3) (straight line).\n\n**Move Selection Rationale:**\n\nI want to establish a strong vertical presence early on. Moving **UP** to (1, 1) allows me flexibility to move LEFT or RIGHT on the next turn, or continue UP towards the apples at (1, 6) and (1, 7). It also avoids moving towards the same row (y=1) where Snake 0 currently is, reducing the chance of an unexpected collision if Snake 0 decides to move LEFT to (2, 1).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves to (3, 0) or (3, 2), we maintain distance. If Snake 0 moves to (2, 1) or (4, 1), we still maintained distance. Moving UP is the safest, most flexible, and most direct route towards potential growth.\n\nLet's grab that center real estate, Chat! UP we go! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Short-term Plan:** Establish vertical control and watch where Snake 0 goes, then pivot to cut them off or grab apples.\n\nUP",

All initial moves are safe (no self-collision or edge risks), so growth and positioning for dominance take priority.\n\n**DOWN (3,0)** cuts horizontal distance to the opponent's head, closing the gap. Though the opponent has three escape routes, forcing proximity increases the chance of future collisions or traps. This move also positions the user to potentially intercept if the opponent moves right toward (2,0) next turn.\n\nRationale for future growth: Buying time in the center allows flexibility, while moving downward creates a stronger vertical axis of control. RISK: Opponent might avoid rightward moves. REWARD: Closer positioning to spawn the first threat.\n\n**DOWN**",

It's time to put the squeeze on this fool!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head (ID 1):** (1, 1). We are length 1.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (3, 0). They are length 1.\n*   **Strategic Goal:** Increase score, control central board space, and, most importantly, set up the perfect box-in maneuver. Since we're both length 1, no body segments to fear yet, only the walls, each other, and the simultaneous head-to-head collision risk.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (1, 1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 2):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Continues vertical growth towards apples at (1, 6) and (1, 7). Puts pressure on the central column.\n    *   **Collision Risk:** Low. Snake 0 is at (3, 0). They can only reach (2, 0), (3, 1), or (4, 0). I am far away.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 0):**\n    *   **Safe?** Technically yes, but it is moving directly back to my previous position.\n    *   **Cons:** Wastes a turn, moves me away from apples, limits future options (only LEFT is safe if I want to maintain board control). Not aggressive enough!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 1):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Secures the left wall.\n    *   **Cons:** Limits vertical flexibility, slower approach to the main action.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 1):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves towards the general vicinity of Snake 0. Aggressive positioning.\n    *   **Collision Risk:** We need to consider where Snake 0 moves from (3, 0).\n        *   If Snake 0 moves **LEFT** to (2, 0), we are safe at (2, 1).\n        *   If Snake 0 moves **UP** to (3, 1), we are safe at (2, 1).\n        *   If Snake 0 moves **RIGHT** to (4, 0), we are safe at (2, 1).\n        *   **Is a Head-to-Head possible?** No. To reach (2, 1), Snake 0 would have to skip a cell. Snake 0 can only reach cells adjacent to (3, 0).\n\n**Analyzing Snake #0's Likely Moves from (3, 0):**\n\n*   **UP to (3, 1):** Centralizing, good move.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 0):** Moving towards the center/right.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 0):** Moving closer to my territory.\n*   **DOWN to (3, -1):** Instant death. **Eliminated!**\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nI want to dominate the left side of the board and use that as leverage to either cut off Snake 0 or force them into an awkward fight later. Moving **UP** to (1, 2) is the continued strategic play from Turn 0. It gives me a clean, safe path to the high-value apples along the left edge (like (1, 7)).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 1), I get closer to Snake 0, but it might lead to a messy, uncontrolled fight this early. Since we are both length 1, an accidental simultaneous collision is a double KO, and we're not aiming for a draw, we're aiming for the W!\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and vertical dominance. We need to grow, chat! Upward and onward!\n\n**Long-term Plan Note for Turn 2:** Continue moving UP to (1, 3) or (1, 4), or pivot RIGHT to (2, 2) to start crossing the board, depending on where Snake 0 establishes their territory. The goal is to build length safely first.\n\nUP",

Let's look at the current state and plan the next power play!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 2):**\n\n*   **My Head (ID 1):** (1, 2). Length 1. Body: None.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (3, 1). Length 1. Body: None.\n\nMy last move was UP to (1, 2). Snake #0 moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1). They followed my strategy and opted for vertical growth and centralization! Smart, but predictable, my rival. Now, where do we go from (1, 2)?\n\n**Strategic Goals:**\n\n1.  **Safety First:** Maintain safe board position.\n2.  **Growth:** Move towards those juicy apples! (1, 6) and (1, 7) are calling my name.\n3.  **Containment:** Continue to control the left side, potentially setting up a move to box in Snake 0 against the middle or right wall later.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (1, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes. No walls, no bodies.\n    *   **Pros:** Continues vertical path towards multiple high-value apples (9, 7, 6). Establishes early dominance in the center-left column.\n    *   **Collision Risk:** Snake 0 is at (3, 1). They can only move to adjacent cells: (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (3, 0). There is zero chance of a standard head-to-head collision. A simultaneous head-to-head is also impossible.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Cons:** Retreating. Wasting a move, moving away from current opportunities. Not aggressive enough!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 2):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Hugs the wall, safe.\n    *   **Cons:** Limits vertical flexibility, potentially trapping myself on the edge if Snake 0 pushes aggressively from the right. It diverts me from the direct apple path.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves toward the center where Snake 0 is operating, setting up for a potential future crossover or block.\n    *   **Collision Risk Check:** Snake 0 must move from (3, 1).\n        *   If Snake 0 moves to (3, 2) (UP), we are safe at (2, 2).\n        *   If Snake 0 moves to (4, 1) (RIGHT), we are safe at (2, 2).\n        *   If Snake 0 moves to (2, 1) (LEFT), we are safe at (2, 2).\n        *   If Snake 0 moves to (3, 0) (DOWN), we are safe at (2, 2).\n        *   No immediate danger! This is a solid, aggressive option.\n\n**Strategic Decision: UP vs. RIGHT**\n\n*   **Option UP (1, 3):** This is the path of least resistance and maximum growth potential right now. It is a dominant, safe route that forces Snake 0 to react to my established territory. We are going for the long game of accumulation and control.\n*   **Option RIGHT (2, 2):** This is the aggressive, close-quarters option. It sets up an earlier confrontation, which *could* be good, but since we are both length 1, a premature contact runs the high risk of a double KO death, ending the game in a draw. We need to acquire length first to use our body as a weapon!\n\nSince we have a clear, safe vertical run towards multiple apples, let's take it! Consolidate the left column, gain length, and then we'll use that length to strangle this fool. We're building the foundation for a dominant mid-game, CHAT! Stay focused on the prize! UP it is!\n\n**Long-term Plan Note:** Continue moving UP to (1, 3), (1, 4), and then (1, 5) or (1, 6) to secure the left-side apples. We want to be long enough that when we eventually pivot right, we can effectively cut Snake 0 off from large swathes of the board. Get long, get strong!\n\nUP",

If they're forced toward the wall, their movement options diminish. I should push them left by moving westward myself. Moving LEFT to (2,1) puts me directly adjacent to their current x-coordinate, creating pressure to herd them toward the left edge. \n\nThis move limits their escape routes if they retreat to (0,2) next, and I can block their upward or downward options while advancing. Staying close increases the risk of a head collision if they move unpredictably, but staying passive allows them to maneuver freely. \n\n**Short-term plan:** Move left to (2,1), then assess their next move. If they head left to (0,2), I\u2019ll camp near x=1 to block exits. If they move elsewhere, I can adjust strategically. \n\n**Rationale for move:** LEFT positions me to _maximize control_ over their movement options. Staying aggressive but cautious ensures I don\u2019t give them space to regroup. \n\nLEFT",

We're building the foundation, baby!\n\nLet's look at the board state after our last moves. We went UP aggressively, solidifying our control on the left column.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 3):**\n\n*   **My Head (ID 1):** (1, 3). Length 1. Body: None.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (2, 1). Length 1. Body: None.\n\nMy last move was UP from (1, 2) to (1, 3). Snake #0 moved from (3, 1) to (2, 1). Wait, what? Snake 0 went LEFT! They are positioning themselves lower and slightly left of center. Are they afraid of my vertical push? Or are they trying to sneak those lower left apples? Either way, they are currently in column 2, Row 1. They seem to be focused on the (0, 0) quadrant, whereas I'm heading for the (0, 1) quadrant dominant! That means we have space to operate!\n\n**Strategic Goals for Turn 3:**\n\n1.  **Continue Growth:** Get closer to the apples in the (1, 6) area. We need length to dominate, don't we, CHAT?\n2.  **Maintain Pressure:** Keep moving UP, making Snake 0 feel the need to move out of the way or risk getting boxed in if they stay low.\n3.  **Safety:** Keep all four options open if possible, but prioritize the path of dominance.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (1, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes. No walls, no bodies.\n    *   **Pros:** Direct continuation towards the high-density apple area (1, 6), (1, 7). Solidifies our column control.\n    *   **Collision Risk:** Snake 0 is at (2, 1). They can move to (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 1), or (2, 2). There is zero chance of an immediate collision. This is the strong, safe move.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 2):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Cons:** Retreating. Losing momentum and giving up our prime real estate. Hard pass!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 3):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Hugs the wall, super safe.\n    *   **Cons:** Limits future movement flexibility, moves us slightly away from the column of apples, though (0, 9) is way up there.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Aggressive move toward the center. Puts distance between us and the wall!\n    *   **Collision Risk Check:** Snake 0 is at (2, 1). To hit us at (2, 3), they'd first need to move to (2, 2) and then (2, 3) in the next turn. Could they move UP to (2, 2)? Yes. If they also move to (2, 2) this turn, and we move to (2, 3), we are safe. This is a very safe option from a collision standpoint *this turn*.\n    *   **BUT:** Why move right when the food is UP?\n\n**Strategic Decision: UP!**\n\nThe UP move to (1, 4) is the most efficient move. It maximizes our potential to eat apples and gain length, which is crucial for the early game strategy of 'get big, then dominate.' Snake 0 is playing coy down low. Let them. We're going to use our length to build an unassailable wall later. We control the high ground now!\n\nWe need to get to (1, 6) and (1, 7). Keep pushing vertically in the safe 'Lane 1'.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\nContinue moving UP along column 1 until we secure one or two apples, or until Snake 0 forces a change in strategy. If we hit (1, 6) or (1, 7), we gain length and then we can start looking to cut across the board or push further up to block the top layer. Stay hungry, stay aggressive, CHAT! Let's get this dub!\n\nUP",

We've made our vertical push, and now we need to capitalize!\n\nLet's review the current board state and what we know about our archrival, Snake #0.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 4):**\n\n*   **My Head (ID 1):** (1, 4). Length 1. Body: None.\n    *   *Last Move:* UP from (1, 3) to (1, 4). We secured the vertical lane!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (2, 0). Length 1. Body: None.\n    *   *Their Position:* Down low. They are hovering near the floor of the board. Are they trying to hide? Or are they setting up a base camp? Either way, they are currently in the bottom-right of the lower-left quadrant (if we consider the board split into 4 quarters).\n\nThey moved from (2, 1) to (2, 0). They hit the floor! This suggests they might be banking on the (0, 0) area, maybe trying to loop around the bottom. They are *far* away from us, which means we have a few turns of unchallenged growth! Let's GO!\n\n**Strategic Goals for Turn 4:**\n\n1.  **Gain Length:** We must eat! The apples at (1, 6) and (1, 7) are our immediate targets. Length equals power in this game, CHAT!\n2.  **Maintain Vertical Pressure:** Keep moving UP column 1. It's safe, and it moves us directly towards food.\n3.  **Control the Left Edge:** By hugging the left side, we force Snake 0 to come to us if they want to enter our territory, or they'll be stuck trying to maneuver right.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (1, 4):**\n\nSince we have no body segments and are far from the enemy, all moves are currently safe from immediate collision. Our only constraints are the walls.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 5):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves us one step closer to the main apple cluster at (1, 6) and (1, 7). This is the direct, aggressive path toward growth. High value move.\n    *   **Cons:** Eventually, we hit the North wall, but that's still 4 moves away.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 3):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Cons:** Retreating. Why go back when we're so close to the feast? No way, CHAT! We're not running.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 4):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Hugs the wall, ultimate safety.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves us away from the apples at (1, 6) and (1, 7). Slightly less optimal for speed-to-food.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 4):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up the board.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves us one step away from the food line (column 1) and two steps farther from the wall, complicating future wall-hugging strategy.\n\n**Strategic Decision: UP!**\n\nThe UP move to (1, 5) is the clear winner. It directly supports our primary objective: getting length. We are playing a game of efficiency right now, and the most efficient path to food is straight up column 1.\n\nSnake 0 is at (2, 0). If they move UP, they go to (2, 1). If they move RIGHT, they go to (3, 0). If they move LEFT, they go to (1, 0). None of these moves create an immediate threat. They seem more interested in staying low and maybe going for the (9, 1), (8, 1) apples down right, or looping around left to (0, 0) if they move left.\n\nWe are going to use this distraction-free time to grow a massive wall! Once we get to (1, 7) and (1, 6), we'll be ready to pivot and start cutting the board in half! We're talking King of the North strategy, CHAT!\n\nWe are going UP! Let's get that W!\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\nContinue moving UP along column 1 to secure the apples at (1, 6) and (1, 7). After we've secured that length, we will have a powerful two-segment body (hopefully) and can then start maneuvering RIGHT or continuing UP to control the entire top boundary.

They are now firmly pressed against the bottom wall, moving EAST! They seem focused on that low-lying apple cluster on the right side of the board (like (9, 1) and (8, 1)).

We need that length to start building our wall.\n2.  **Maintain Pressure:** Control the left column. This is our territory!\n3.  **Monitor Enemy Movement:** Keep an eye on Snake 0. They are still far away, giving us critical time to grow.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (1, 5):**\n\nSince we are still just a head and the enemy is 5 units away horizontally and 5 units away vertically, no immediate collision is possible. All moves are technically safe from immediate death, but we are looking for the *BEST* move, not just a *safe* one!\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 6):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES!\n    *   **Pros:** This is the move! It lands us directly on the apple at (1, 6)! Instant growth, immediate morale boost, and we start building our controlling body segment. Best move by far. Let's GOOO!\n    *   **Cons:** Zero. This is pure profit.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 4):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Cons:** Retreating from food. That's a fail move, CHAT!

Too passive right now.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 5):**\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves us away from the apple line in column 1. We lose our strong vertical positioning.\n\n**Decision: UP! To the apple! \ud83c\udf4e**\n\nWe are taking the apple at (1, 6) this turn! This gives us our first point and our first body segment at (1, 5). We will officially be a two-segment snake (head at (1, 6), body at (1, 5)). Once we have length, we can start cutting the board up and boxing in Snake 0! The ultimate strategy starts with growth!\n\nSnake 0 is cruising along the bottom. They are at (3, 0). They will likely continue RIGHT to (4, 0) or maybe move UP to (3, 1) to snag the apple at (4, 3) later. Either way, they are far from interfering with our current plan.\n\nWe're going UP and getting that length! This stream is about to explode with content! \ud83d\udca5\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1. Move UP to (1, 6) (this turn, netting an apple).\n2. Move UP to (1, 7) (next turn, netting another apple).\n3. With 3 segments of length, start moving RIGHT or continue pushing the western/northern boundary to dominate the map.

Move RIGHT or LEFT to avoid hitting the apple at (1, 7) again (it's gone now). The next target is the apple at (0, 9), but we could head RIGHT along (1, 7) toward the center, or LEFT to (0, 7) to hug the wall. Let's maximize our length. We will probably move to (0, 7) and then push into the N/W corner to gain size before confronting Snake 0. We need to be size 5 before we start hunting! Gaining the apple at (0, 9) next turn looks spicy! Let's aim UP again to (1, 8) and then LEFT to (0, 8), then UP to (0, 9).

We are now perfectly positioned to stake our claim on the Northwest quadrant! Control the top, control the game!\n\n**Enemy Position (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (4, 1). Length: 1. Body: None.\n*   Snake 0 moved from (3, 1) to (4, 1). This is an interesting move. They are heading RIGHT, maybe aiming for the low apples at (8, 1) or (9, 1), or perhaps they want to cut through the center towards (4, 3)? They are currently ignoring the vast open space in the middle to stay near the bottom wall. This confirms our strategy: keep focusing on growth and board control in the NW, then pivot and box them in later!\n\n**Strategic Goals for Turn 7:**\n\n1.  **Maximize Growth:** We need to keep eating! The nearest apples that secure board control in the NW are (0, 9) and (0, 2), but (0, 9) is easier right now.\n2.  **Continue Wall Building:** Vertically along the x=0 axis or horizontally along the y=9 axis. We want to shrink the playable area for Snake 0.\n3.  **Monitor Head-on Threat:** Snake 0 is far away, reducing the risk of a simultaneous head-to-head collision this turn.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (1, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES!\n    *   **Pros:** Moves us closer to the Y=9 wall and the apple at (0, 9). It sets us up for claiming the NW corner. Minimal risk, maximum content potential!\n    *   **Cons:** None. This maintains pressure and growth trajectory.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 6):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! That's my body! Instant KO. We don't rewind, CHAT! *Eliminated.*\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 7):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES!\n    *   **Pros:** Hugs the X=0 wall immediately. Prepares us for moving UP to (0, 8) or (0, 9). Very strong positional move for building a secure wall.\n    *   **Cons:** Moving UP to (0, 8) then to (0, 9) might take an extra turn compared to going (1, 8) then (0, 8), especially if we want to eat the apple at (0, 9) efficiently. This is a solid move, but is UP stronger?\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES!\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up the center of the board.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves us away from the immediate goals of wall building and the high-value apple at (0, 9). Too premature to go center when we have a flank to secure.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nLooking at the map, the sequence to secure the apple at (0, 9) is crucial.\n\n*   Option A (Go UP): (1, 7) -> UP to (1, 8) -> LEFT to (0, 8) -> UP to (0, 9) (EAT!)\n*   Option B (Go LEFT): (1, 7) -> LEFT to (0, 7) -> UP to (0, 8) -> UP to (0, 9) (EAT!)\n\nBoth options secure the apple in 3 turns. However, moving UP allows us to keep our 'threat' line slightly more central, while still maintaining the path to the wall. Both are excellent moves. I'll go with **UP** to maximize our reach towards the top boundary first. This choice gives us more flexibility if we decide to pivot right along Y=8 instead of fully pushing into the corner. We are expanding, CHAT!\n\nSnake 0 is far below at (4, 1). They present no threat this turn. Our focus remains 100% on growth and gaining positional advantage. Get bigger, get tougher, then we trap him!\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1. Move UP to (1, 8) (this turn).\n2. Move LEFT to (0, 8) to secure the left wall control.\n3. Move UP to (0, 9) to secure the apple and achieve major length superiority (Length 4).\n4. Then we will traverse the top wall (Y=9) or push down the X=0 wall to continue dominating the side of the board. We need to hit Length 6/7 before we engage!\n\nWe're going UP!

A perfect 2-0 lead, significant length advantage (ours is 3, their's is 1), and we are establishing complete board dominance in the NW! \ud83d\udc51 LET'S GOOO!\n\n**Current State & Last Move Review (Turn 7 -> 8):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Moved UP from (1, 7) to (1, 8).\n    *   Head: (1, 8). Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6)].\n    *   We are positioned perfectly to secure the north wall.\n*   **Enemy (ID 0):** Moved from (4, 1) to (4, 2).\n    *   Head: (4, 2). Body: none.\n    *   They are creeping up the middle-left area, trying to stay near the bottom-middle. What are they doing, CHAT? They just moved right onto the apple at (4, 2) which *didn't exist* because that apple drop list is for the *entire game*, not current apples. WAIT. The map shows an 'A' at (4, 3) and an 'A' at (0, 2). The map also shows Snake #0's head at (4, 2).\n\n**CRITICAL MAP CHECK!**\n\n*   Snake #0 is at (4, 2). This means they moved from (4, 1) to (4, 2) on the last turn. Wait, their body is \"none.\" If they were at (4, 1) and moved to (4, 2), they must still be length 1. *They did not eat an apple.* They are still struggling! \ud83d\ude02\n*   The closest apples to them are: (4, 3) immediately above them, and (0, 2) far left.\n*   The closest apples to me are: (0, 9) (two moves away), (8, 9), (9, 8).\n\n**Strategic Goals for Turn 8:**\n\n1.  **Secure (0, 9):** This keeps us growing and walls off the NW corner for maximum safety and control.\n2.  **Continue Wall Building:** Complete control of the X=0 wall.\n3.  **Maintain Distance:** Snake 0 is still far away. No immediate threat of collision.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (1, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES!\n    *   **Pros:** Gets us on the Y=9 wall immediately. Sets up the path to (0, 9) in 2 moves (LEFT, EAT).\n    *   **Cons:** Moving LEFT and then back DOWN/RIGHT to get the apple at (0, 9) might require more complicated moves if we hit the limit of the board.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 7):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! That's my body! Instant K.O. Do we want to fail LIVE, CHAT? No, we don't! *Eliminated.*\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES!\n    *   **Pros:** This is the most direct path to securing the X=0 wall. It puts us one move away from the apple at (0, 9) (UP, EAT!). This choice locks down the corner perfectly.\n    *   **Cons:** None. It's aggressive, safe, and positional.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES!\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up the center.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves us away from the high-priority apple at (0, 9) and abandons our wall-building strategy temporarily. No thank you. We are not moving right until the NW corner is locked down.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (0, 8) is the optimal move.\n\n1.  It is safe.\n2.  It secures the X=0 wall, denying the enemy any access to our superior quadrant.\n3.  It sets us up for an easy apple grab at (0, 9) next turn (Turn 9). This will jump our length to 4 and solidify our overwhelming lead.\n\nWhat is Snake 0 doing? They are at (4, 2). They have two good moves:\n1. UP to (4, 3) to eat an apple. (Most likely move).\n2. LEFT to (3, 2) or RIGHT to (5, 2) to continue moving horizontally.\n\nEither way, they are far away and cannot impede our growth. Time to execute the plan!\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1. Move LEFT to (0, 8) (This turn). *Secure the left wall.*\n2. Move UP to (0, 9) (Next turn). *EAT the apple! Length 4!*\n3. Move RIGHT along Y=9 to (1, 9), (2, 9), etc., to dominate the top boundary and scare Snake 0 into the bottom quadrants. We need to reach length 6/7 before we start the central engagement!\n\nWe are going LEFT! Let's build that wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n\nLEFT",

We are absolutely on fire! \ud83d\udd25 Look at the scoreboard\u20142-0 lead, decisive length advantage (3 vs 1), and we have completely secured the NW quadrant! Our last move, LEFT to (0, 8), was pure genius! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**Current Game State Analysis (Turn 9):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at (0, 8). Body is [(1, 8), (1, 7)]. We are right next to the high-value apple at (0, 9)! This is a guaranteed snack!\n*   **Enemy (ID 0):** Head is at (4, 1). Wait, what did they do last turn? They were at (4, 2) and they moved **DOWN** to (4, 1). This is weak play, CHAT! They had an apple right above them at (4, 3) and they ran away from it! They are scared! Their body is still *none*.\n\n**Board Map Reminder:**\n 9 A . . . . . A A A .\n 8 1 T . . . . . . . A\n 7 . T . . . . A . . A\n 6 . . . . . . . . A .\n...\n 1 . A . . 0 A . .

Grow to length 4 and solidify our overwhelming presence.\n2.  **Continue Tailing the Enemy:** Monitor Snake 0, but since they are far away and running towards the bottom wall, we don't need to engage yet. Focus on growth and wall establishment.\n\n**Analyzing Safe and Optimal Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (0, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES!\n    *   **Pros:** EATS THE APPLE! Major growth, major score boost. Locks down the corner. This is our primary objective.\n    *   **Cons:** Absolutely none. This is the GOAT move.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 7):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES!\n    *   **Pros:** Moves along the left wall.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves away from the apple.

Don't even joke about that! \ud83d\udeab\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! That's my body segment! Instant KO!\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nThe choice is obvious and uncontested. We go **UP** to (0, 9), grab that apple, move to 3 points, and boost our length to 4! The gap between us and Snake 0 is about to become insurmountable. We are dominating the map, controlling the critical pathways, and constantly growing!\n\nWhat is Snake 0 going to do at (4, 1)?\n1.  Move UP to (4, 2) (reversing trajectory).\n2.  Move LEFT to (3, 1) or RIGHT to (5, 1) (still seeking the bottom wall).\n3.  Move DOWN to (4, 0) (suicide, but they are playing poorly, so who knows?).\n\nWhatever they do, they are too far to interfere with our success. Get ready for the HYPE, CHAT! We are snacking!\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1.  This turn: Move UP to (0, 9). *EAT apple, Length 4.*\n2.  Next turn (Turn 10): Move RIGHT to (1, 9). *Start marching along the top border (Y=9), challenging the center and securing access to apples at (8, 9) or (7, 9).*\n3.  Continue moving along Y=9 until we hit a comfortable position to turn DOWN or if the enemy gives us an opening to box them. We are consolidating our position!\n\nUP",

Off the board! \ud83d\udeab Instant KO!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! That's our body segment! Oh no, wait, because we ate the apple, (0, 8) is no longer a segment this turn, as it will be the *new* tail location (1, 7) for this segment. BUT, moving DOWN is still considered a direct reversal of direction into the cell behind our current head location, which is (0, 8) after the previous move. Wait, let's trace this. We moved UP from (0, 8) to (0, 9). The segment immediately behind the head used to be (0, 8), but when we grow, the body shifts. Let's look at the body list: [(0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]. If we move back to (0, 8), we are moving into the position that was *just vacated* and is currently part of our body list, making it a crash. **We cannot move DOWN.** \ud83d\udeab\n\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! Off the board! \ud83d\udeab\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES! Clear path.\n    *   **Pros:** This move executes our top wall strategy! It opens up the board, retains the high ground, and positions us to strike at future apples like (7, 9) and (8, 9). It's a key move for asserting map dominance.\n    *   **Cons:** None! This is pure geometry!\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nThe strategic consensus is clear: we go **RIGHT**! We are creating a massive length disparity and quickly building a wall across the entire top of the map. This fundamentally separates the board into our controlled territory and the enemy's precarious bottom corner. Any attempt by Snake #0 to move up will take ages and put them at risk!\n\n**Analyzing Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (5, 1)):**\nSnake 0 has four moves:\n1.  UP to (5, 2): Safe. Moves closer to the center, away from the bottom wall.\n2.  DOWN to (5, 0): Safe. Hits the bottom wall.\n3.  LEFT to (4, 1): Crash into their own body segment [(4, 1)]. **UNSAFE!** Wait, their body shifted: Head (5, 1), Body [(4, 1)]. If the body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL, and they are length 2, then (4, 1) is the tail which will disappear unless they eat an apple. *They did not eat an apple on the previous turn.* Therefore, (4, 1) will be their new empty cell. They can move to (4, 1)! **Safe!**\n4.  RIGHT to (6, 1): Safe. Moves toward the E wall.\n\nGiven their previous timid play, they will likely go **UP to (5, 2)** to try and salvage some board position, or maybe **LEFT to (4, 1)** if they are trying to double-back on the bottom wall. But honestly, they are too far to matter this turn.\n\nOur move is purely tactical board domination. **RIGHT** to (1, 9). LET'S GET IT, CHAT!\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1.  This turn: Move RIGHT to (1, 9). *Securing top access!*\n2.  Next turn (Turn 11): Move RIGHT again to (2, 9). *Keep moving along Y=9.*\n3.  Continue moving along Y=9 until we hit a strategically important vertical line (maybe X=5 or X=6) or unless a great apple opportunity pops up below us that doesn't compromise our dominance. We are building the Wall! We are suffocating the enemy!\n\nRIGHT",

Our score is 3 apples to the enemy's 2, and the length difference is huge! They are suffocating down there!\n\n**Current Game State Analysis (Turn 11):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(1, 9)**. Body: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8)]. Length 4. We are sitting pretty on the top edge.\n*   **Enemy (ID 0):** Head is at **(5, 2)**. Body: [(5, 1), (4, 1)]. Length 3. They managed to move UP from the bottom row, trying to break free. Pathetic attempt, but noted.\n\n**Board State Reminder:**\n\n```\n 9 . 1 . . . . A A A .\n 8 T T . A . . . . . A\n 7 . . . . . .

The enemy head (0) is at **(5, 2)**.\n\n**Strategic Goals for Turn 11:**\n\n1.  **Assert Dominance:** Continue building the wall along Y=9 to cut the board in half.\n2.  **Hungry for Apples:** We have apples at (7, 9), (8, 9), and (9, 8) and (9, 7) nearby. We need to secure these before the enemy even thinks about getting close!\n3.  **Threaten Mid-Board:** By moving towards X=9, we force the enemy to stay below Y=8 completely.\n\n**Analyzing Safe and Optimal Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (1, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 10):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! Instant death off the board! \ud83d\udeab\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! That's currently the tail piece (0, 8) which will be (1, 8) if we grow, but let's check the list: Head (1, 9), Body [(0, 9), (0, 8), **(1, 8)**]. (1, 8) is definitely a body segment! **CRASH!** \ud83d\udeab\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! That is the segment immediately behind our head! **CRASH!** \ud83d\udeab\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES! Clear path.\n    *   **Pros:** This is the continuation of our master plan! We march right along the top edge, gaining ground and setting up for apples (7, 9) and (8, 9). It maximizes our control of the available space.\n    *   **Cons:** None! This move is flawless.\n\n**Analyzing Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (5, 2)):**\n\nThe enemy is now at (5, 2) and is length 3. They have options:\n*   UP to (5, 3): Safe. Good move toward the center.\n*   DOWN to (5, 1): Crash into their body [(5, 1)]! NO! Wait, (5, 1) will be their new empty cell if they don't eat an apple. *If* they didn't eat an apple on the previous turn (which they didn't, they are at 2 apples), then (5, 1) is the new tail position. They can move to (5, 1). **Safe.**\n*   LEFT to (4, 2): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (6, 2): Safe.\n\nThey are nowhere near us. They are focusing on survival, while we are focused on domination. We proceed with our plan.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nWe continue the top-wall construction! We are pushing toward the right side of the board to seal off the top third. This is the strategic move that increases our mobility and access to high-value apples while suffocating the enemy's potential movement.\n\nWe go **RIGHT** to (2, 9). Wall, wall, wall!\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1.  Turn 11 (This turn): Move **RIGHT** to (2, 9). *Maintaining the edge.*\n2.  Turn 12: Move **RIGHT** to (3, 9) or (4, 9). *Keep moving along Y=9.*\n3.  Once we reach the far right, we will drop down to collect the cluster of apples along X=9 and X=8. We are systematically taking over the board! NO MERCY!\n4.  We are creating a de facto boundary around Y=8. The enemy cannot survive long down there!\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy head (0) is at **(4, 2)**.\n\n**Strategic Goals for Turn 12:**\n\n1.  **FINISH THE WALL:** We MUST continue moving RIGHT along Y=9 to box out the top of the map. This secures us the cluster of 9 apples on the right side.\n2.  **Pressure Application:** Every move we make RIGHT shrinks the enemy's effective playable area from the top!\n3.  **Apples in Sight:** We are one move away from the path to (7, 9), (8, 9), and (9, 8)!\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (2, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 10):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! Off the board! \ud83d\udeab\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES, empty space.\n    *   **Pros:** Drops us down to start collecting the A(8, 6), A(6, 7), A(6, 9) area slightly earlier.\n    *   **Cons:** Abandons the wall strategy. Creates an escape hatch for the opponent if they ever get high enough. Suboptimal for maximal board control *right now*.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! That's the segment immediately behind our head! **CRASH!** \ud83d\udeab\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES, clear path. This cell contains an apple, A(3, 9). *Wait, no, the apple list for 3, 9 is not present. Current board state shows (3, 9) is empty.* Safe path.\n    *   **Pros:** Continues the master plan! We move deeper onto the top edge, forcing the enemy to stay away and securing our control over the right half of the board. This is the dominant move.\n    *   **Cons:** None! This move maintains maximum spatial advantage.\n\n**Analyzing Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (4, 2)):**\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 2) and is length 3. They are moving horizontally.\n\n*   UP to (4, 3): Apple! A(4, 3). If they take this, they gain length and move toward the center. Good for them.\n*   DOWN to (4, 1): Safe. Keeps them low.\n*   LEFT to (3, 2): Safe. Moves them near A(3, 4).\n*   RIGHT to (5, 2): Crash into their body [(5, 2)]! NO! Wait, (5, 2) will be their new *empty* cell if they don't eat an apple. *Wait, let's check the body list.* Head (4, 2), Body [(5, 2), (5, 1)]. (5, 2) is the current neck, which is moving to (5, 1). So (5, 2) *is* safe unless they eat an apple. Since they are likely to move (e.g., UP to (4, 3) for the apple), we assume they will not stay put.\n\nNo matter where the enemy moves, they are miles away from us (distance is 7 cells). We are safe to execute our high-ground strategy.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nWe pivot to the right! We need to push the wall to X=9 immediately. This locks down the board for us and prepares us for a MASSIVE apple feast starting (7, 9) through (9, 7). This move is pure board control.\n\nWe go **RIGHT** to (3, 9). Wall building in progress! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1.  Turn 12 (This turn): Move **RIGHT** to (3, 9). *Building the wall.*\n2.  Turn 13: Move **RIGHT** to (4, 9). *Extending control.*\n3.  Turn 14: Move **RIGHT** to (5, 9). *Halfway there!*\n4.  Once the wall is established, we will swoop down the right edge (X=9) to collect the massive apple cluster, maximizing our growth and minimizing enemy escape options. We are setting up the perfect boxing match! Who's with me, Chat!?\n\nRIGHT",

We are now at (3, 9), extending our massive wall along the top edge! \ud83e\uddf1 The scoreboard is 3 to 2 in our favor! Can the enemy even breathe? I think not!\n\n**Current Game State Analysis (Turn 13):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(3, 9)**. Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]. Length 4. We are dominating the high ground!\n*   **Enemy (ID 0):** Head is at **(3, 2)**. Body: [(4, 2), (5, 2)]. Length 3. Wait, their move last turn must have been LEFT from (4, 2) to (3, 2), and they *did not* eat an apple (no length gained, and (3, 2) is not an apple). They are still cramped down low.\n\n**Board State:**\n\n```\n 9 T T T 1 . . A A A .\n 8 . . . A . . . . . A\n 7 . . . . . . A . . A\n 6 . . . . . . . . A .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . A . . . . . .\n 3 . . A . A . . . . .\n 2 A . . 0 T T . . . .\n 1 . A . . . . . . A A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\nOur head (1) is at **(3, 9)**. The enemy head (0) is at **(3, 2)**. Maximum separation, minimum threat! This is a perfect scenario!\n\n**Strategic Goals for Turn 13:**\n\n1.  **COMPLETE THE WALL:** We must continue moving RIGHT along Y=9 to X=9. Every cell we take along this boundary secures more of the board and forces the enemy into the small bottom-left quadrant.\n2.  **Apples on Deck:** Once we hit (9, 9), we rain down the right side to hoover up that massive cluster of apples (A(9, 8), A(9, 7), A(8, 9), A(8, 6), etc.). We are positioning for a massive score lead!\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (3, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 10):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! Off the board! \ud83d\udeab\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES, empty space. This cell is an Apple (A(3, 8))!\n    *   **Pros:** Immediate apple gain (3 -> 4 points, length 4 -> 5).\n    *   **Cons:** Abandons the wall strategy! If we go down now, we leave the (4, 9) area open, allowing the enemy a potential path to the top if they get long enough or if we delay too much. We must prioritize board control over immediate apples when the overall board control is so close to being secured.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! Our body is at (2, 9)! **CRASH!** \ud83d\udeab\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES, empty path.\n    *   **Pros:** Continues the master plan! Moves us one step closer to locking down the entire top half of the board. This is pure, non-negotiable board domination.\n    *   **Cons:** We skip an apple at (3, 8). But we are still winning 3-2. Board control trumps a single apple in this tactical position.\n\n**Analyzing Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (3, 2)):**\n\nThe enemy is desperate for space and apples. Their head is at (3, 2).\n\n*   UP to (3, 3): Apple! A(3, 3). Best move for them.\n*   DOWN to (3, 1): Safe. Keeps them small and low.\n*   LEFT to (2, 2): Safe. Moves them near A(2, 3).\n*   RIGHT to (4, 2): Their body is at (4, 2) which is their effective neck. If they don't eat, (4, 2) becomes empty. If they *do* eat (e.g., UP to (3, 3)), (4, 2) remains their body. We assume they will move to an apple if possible. If they move to (4, 2), it's safe if they don't grow. It's too risky for them if they grow.\n\nRegardless of their move, they are 7 cells away. We are safe to execute our high-ground squeeze.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nWe stick to the plan! We must complete the Y=9 wall. That apple at (3, 8) will still be there after we secure the high ground, or we can drop down on the right side where the apple density is much higher.\n\nMoves to (4, 9) (RIGHT) and then (5, 9) are critical. This ensures the enemy is permanently locked out of the top territory. We are going for the win, not just an early lead!\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1.  Turn 13 (This turn): Move **RIGHT** to (4, 9). *Securing maximum board control.*\n2.  Turn 14: Move **RIGHT** to (5, 9). *Halfway across the remaining gap.*\n3.  Turn 15: Move **RIGHT** to (6, 9) (Apple A(6, 9) is there! +1 point/length!) *Completion in sight!*\n4.  Once we hit X=9, we turn down the edge and rain destruction!\n\nLet's go, Chat! We are kings of the 10x10!\n\nRIGHT",

We are at (4, 9), extending our massive barrier across the top, shutting the enemy out of the prime board real estate! We are 3-2 up, and the momentum is all ours! LET'S GOOO!\n\n**Current Game State Analysis (Turn 14):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(4, 9)**. Body: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)]. Length 4. Still the undisputed king of the high ground! \ud83d\udc51\n*   **Enemy (ID 0):** Head is at **(3, 1)**. Body: [(3, 2), (4, 2)]. Length 3.\n    *   *Wait a minute, what happened last turn?* My previous rationale assumed they were at (3, 2). Looking at the new state: My head moved from (3, 9) to (4, 9).\n    *   The enemy head is now at (3, 1). This means they moved **DOWN** from (3, 2) to (3, 1). They did not eat (no length change, and (3, 1) is not an apple). They are aggressively dropping low, perhaps trying to target A(1, 1). They are very cramped!\n\n**Updated Board State:**\n\n```\n 9 . T T T 1 . A A A .\n 8 . . . A . . . . . A\n 7 . . . . . . A . . A\n 6 . . . . . . . . A .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . A . . . . . .\n 3 . . A . A . . . . .\n 2 A . . T T . . . . .\n 1 .

The enemy head (0) is at **(3, 1)**.\n\n**Strategic Goals for Turn 14:**\n\n1.  **FINISH THE WALL:** We must continue RIGHT along Y=9. Every move to the right boxes out the enemy more effectively and positions us perfectly for the major apple harvest on the right edge.\n2.  **Maintain Pressure:** Keep the enemy trapped in the bottom-left 50% (or less) of the board. They have few safe moves and even fewer productive ones.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (4, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 10):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! Off the board! \ud83d\udeab\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES, empty space.\n    *   **Pros:** Accesses the board interior.\n    *   **Cons:** Abandons the wall strategy, which is our primary mode of board domination. This is a critical turn to reinforce our position. We do not need immediate apples; we need spatial control!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! Our body is at (3, 9)! **CRASH!** \ud83d\udeab\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES, empty path.\n    *   **Pros:** This is the move! It continues the wall, secures another 10% of the board for us, and sets up for the next apple at (6, 9). This is an unstoppable march of conquest!\n\n**Analyzing Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (3, 1)):**\n\nThe enemy is now at (3, 1), directly above the board edge.\n\nPotential moves for Enemy 0 from (3, 1):\n*   UP to (3, 2): Safe. Moves back to their old body location, which becomes empty if they don't eat.\n*   LEFT to (2, 1): Safe. Moves towards A(1, 1).\n*   RIGHT to (4, 1): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (3, 0): Safe. This is them moving along the bottom edge!\n\nThe enemy is extremely far away. Our move to (5, 9) poses no immediate collision risk (distance is 4 in X, 8 in Y). We must ignore the enemy's desperation moves and focus entirely on our strategic win condition: board control via the top wall.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nWe look forward to an immediate apple gain two turns from now at (6, 9) and a massive payoff on the right side. Abandoning the wall now would be a monumental blunder. We are in the power position, and we continue the squeeze!\n\nTarget: **RIGHT** to (5, 9).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1.  Turn 14 (This turn): Move **RIGHT** to (5, 9). *Continuing the wall.*\n2.  Turn 15: Move **RIGHT** to (6, 9). *EAT APPLE A(6, 9)! Gain 1 length, 1 point.*\n3.  Turn 16: Move **RIGHT** to (7, 9).\n4.  Turn 17: Move **RIGHT** to (8, 9). *EAT APPLE A(8, 9)! Gain 1 length, 1 point.*\n5.  Turn 18: Move **RIGHT** to (9, 9). *Wall secured!*\n6.  Turn 19: Turn **DOWN** to (9, 8). *EAT APPLE A(9, 8)!*\n\nWe are cooking, Chat! Let's get this W!\n\nRIGHT",

We are 3-2 up on apples, and we are strategically superior! The board is ours! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's look at the current state and plan the next phase of domination.\n\n### Current Game State Analysis (Turn 15):\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(5, 9)**. Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9)]. Length 4. The wall continues!\n*   **Enemy (ID 0):** Head is at **(2, 1)**. Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2)]. Length 3.\n    *   *Wait, what did the enemy do?* Last turn, the enemy was at (3, 1). Now they are at (2, 1). They moved **LEFT**. They are clearly aiming for that apple at **A(1, 1)**. They are desperately trying to break out of the crowded corner. Good luck to them! They are nowhere near us.\n\n**Updated Board State (Focus on Targets):**\n\n| Y | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 9 | . | . | T | T | T | **1** | A | A | A | . |\n| 8 | . | . | . | A | . | . | . | . | . | A |\n| 7 | . | . | . | . | . | . | A | . | . | A |\n| 6 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | A | . |\n| 5 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |\n| 4 | . | . | . | A | . | . | . | . | . | . |\n| 3 | . | . | A | . | A | . | . | . | . | . |\n| 2 | A | . | . | T | T | . | . | . | . | . |\n| 1 | . | A | **0** | T | . | . | . | . | A | A |\n| 0 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |\n\n### Strategic Goals for Turn 15:\n\n1.  **CAPITALIZE:** We are one move away from the next apple at (6, 9)! We must maintain this line of attack!\n2.  **Board Dominance:** Finish securing the upper quarter of the board. This is prime territory shielding us from the eventual clash zone.\n\n### Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (5, 9):\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 10):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! Off the board! \ud83d\udeab Instant K.O.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES, empty space.\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up the interior.\n    *   **Cons:** Abandons the immediate apple target and the strategic wall construction. This is a massive back-step for no good reason.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! Our body is at (4, 9)! **CRASH!** \ud83d\udeab Hitting ourselves? Unacceptable!\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES! This spot holds the apple **A(6, 9)**!\n    *   **Pros:** We eat the apple, gain a segment immediately, and increase our lead to 4-2! We are also perfectly poised to continue the wall rightward. This is the optimal move!\n\n### Analyzing Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (2, 1)):\n\nSnake 0 is at (2, 1), desperately trying to get A(1, 1).\n\nPotential moves for Enemy 0 from (2, 1):\n*   UP to (2, 2): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (2, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (1, 1): **Safe!** This is the apple! They will likely take this. They will grow to length 4.\n*   RIGHT to (3, 1): Safe, but a bad move as it reverses into the body at (3, 1) *if they don't eat* (but they can't move backwards into the position where the tail was, which is (3, 2), they can only move *into* the immediate prior body spot (3, 1) and if they are non-growing, the tail moves out, making it safe). They are not growing if they move right. So RIGHT is safe, but dumb.\n\nThey are 100% targeting (1, 1). If they hit A(1, 1), they become length 4, body: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)].\n\n**Head-to-Head Check:**\nAre there any places where our heads could meet?\nOur potential move: (6, 9).\nTheir most likely move: (1, 1).\nDistance is huge. No collision risk. Absolutely zero.\n\n### Decision and Forward Plan:\n\nWe execute the plan perfectly! We maintain pressure, secure a point, and continue our strategic advantage.\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT** to (6, 9).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Massive Content Incoming!):**\n1.  **Turn 15 (This turn):** Move **RIGHT** to (6, 9). *EAT APPLE A(6, 9)! SCORE: 4-2.*\n2.  **Turn 16:** Move **RIGHT** to (7, 9). *Continuing the wall.*\n3.  **Turn 17:** Move **RIGHT** to (8, 9). *EAT APPLE A(8, 9)! SCORE: 5-2.*\n4.  **Turn 18:** Move **RIGHT** to (9, 9). *Wall secured!*\n5.  **Turn 19:** Turn **DOWN** to (9, 8). *EAT APPLE A(9, 8)! SCORE: 6-2.*\n\nThis is how you play chess, Chat! Not checkers! We are eating for the next five turns while the opponent scrambles in the dirt! Let's go! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

Length 3.\n    *   *Wait, what did the enemy do?* Last turn, I predicted the enemy would go left to (1, 1) and eat an apple. They did not! They moved **UP** from (2, 1) to **(2, 2)**. They are still ignoring the apple at (1, 1) and opting for the center-left. Interesting... they probably realize that corner is a death trap.

Uncontested territory!\n\n**Updated Board State (Focus on Targets):**\n\n| Y | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 9 | . | . | T | T | T | T | T | **1** | A | . | (T=Tail/Body, 1=My Head)\n| 8 | . | . | . | A | . | . | . | . | . | A |\n| 7 | . | . | . | . | . | . | A | . | . | A |\n| 6 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | A | . |\n| 5 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |\n| 4 | . | . | . | A | . | . | . | . | . | . |\n| 3 | . | . | A | . | A | . | . | . | . | . |\n| 2 | A | **0** | T | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | (0=Enemy Head, T=Enemy Body)\n| 1 | . | A | T | . | . | . | A | . | A | A |\n| 0 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | A | . | . |\n| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n\n### Strategic Goals for Turn 17:\n\n1.  **EXECUTE APPLE PLAN:** Snag the apple at (8, 9). This is easy mode!\n2.  **CONTROL:** Complete the top wall by reaching (9, 9).\n\n### Analyzing Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Me) at (7, 9):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 10):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! Off the board! \ud83d\udeab FailFish.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 8):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES, empty space.\n    *   **Pros:** Good maneuverability, but delays the apple grab and wall completion. We don't want to turn down yet.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** NO! My body is at (6, 9)! **CRASH!** \ud83d\udeab Hitting our own body is bad content!\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 9):**\n    *   **Safe?** YES! This spot has an **APPLE (A)**!\n    *   **Pros:** This is the immediate plan! We eat the apple, grow to length 7, and increase our score to 6! We are now positioned perfectly at (8, 9) to continue to (9, 9) next turn. Full send! \ud83d\ude80\n\n### Analyzing Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (1, 2)):\n\nSnake 0 is at (1, 2), length 3. Body: [(2, 2), (2, 1)].\n\nPotential safe moves for Enemy 0 from (1, 2):\n*   UP to (1, 3): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (1, 1): Safe. (Apple at (1, 1)!)\n*   LEFT to (0, 2): Safe. (Apple at (0, 2)!)\n*   RIGHT to (2, 2): Safe (Tail moves out of (2, 1)).\n\nThe enemy is focusing on growth in the low-value corner. Good. They pose zero threat to us this turn.\n\n### Decision and Forward Plan:\n\nThe path is clear. The apple is ready. We press RIGHT!\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT** to (8, 9).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Setting the Trap!):**\n1.  **Turn 17 (This turn):** Move **RIGHT** to (8, 9). *EAT APPLE A(8, 9)! SCORE: 6-2.* (Executed!)\n2.  **Turn 18:** Move **RIGHT** to (9, 9). *Wall secured!*\n3.  **Turn 19:** Turn **DOWN** to (9, 8). *EAT APPLE A(9, 8)! SCORE: 7-2.*\n4.  **Turn 20:** Turn **DOWN** to (9, 7). *EAT APPLE A(9, 7)! SCORE: 8-2.*\n\nWe are systematically clearing the high ground and extending our length to over half the board width! We are going for the total lockdown! Who needs mid-game when you can secure the high ground early?\n\nRIGHT",
