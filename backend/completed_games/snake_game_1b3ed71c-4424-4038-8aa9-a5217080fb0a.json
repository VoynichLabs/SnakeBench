But it moves us into the interior of our own loop and leaves us with only one safe follow-up move (LEFT to 5,8). It also increases distance to the key apple at (1,7).\n\n- DOWN → (6,6): Safe, with open space below, but it pulls us away from our uncontested top-left apple and toward the enemy’s side and the bottom apple cluster, where they have an access advantage.\n\n- LEFT → (5,7): Safe (cell is empty, on-board, and not our neck). It keeps several future options open (from 5,7 we can go UP, DOWN, or further LEFT) and is the most direct route toward the apple at (1,7), which we are already closer to than the enemy.\n\nGiven safety and apple race considerations, LEFT is clearly best.\n\nPlan for the next few turns (note to future self):\n- Continue moving LEFT along row 7 to secure the apple at (1,7); our tail will keep vacating behind us, so we won’t cut ourselves off.\n- After eating (1,7), reassess: we’ll likely be 8–5 ahead in apples. From roughly (1,7), consider moving either DOWN the left column to pressure the (1,2)/(1,1) apples if the enemy hasn’t taken them yet, or staying in the upper-left area to maintain safe space and avoid unnecessary head-on risks.\n\nLEFT",

UP to (5,1) keeps options open but RIGHT to (6,0) directly shifts toward the closest fruit and maintains a safe path along the bottom, away from the top-heavy enemy snake #0 which is around y=7. There’s no immediate threat of contact with enemy heads this turn, and moving along the bottom row provides multiple escape routes in the following turns.\n\nPlan: Choose the move that both increases the chance to eat an apple sooner and preserves flexibility for future moves. RIGHT seems to best accomplish that by reducing the distance to the (8,0) apple and keeping a safe, open corridor near the bottom.\n\nFinal decision:\nRIGHT",
