          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We are live! This is the moment, Turn 0! Straight into the action. We've got a 10x10 board, two baby snakes, and our archrival, Snake #0, right above us! Can we get the early lead? Absolutely!\n\n### Current Board Analysis\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (6, 2) - We're chilling in the bottom-right quadrant.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (5, 6) - He's up higher, slightly left of the center.\n*   **Closest Apple:** (5, 4) is the closet *visible* apple we can immediately aim towards, but (6, 7) is also an option if we go UP/RIGHT.\n\nThis is the start of the game, so both snakes are length 1. This means the biggest immediate danger is the wall or a perfectly timed head-on collision.\n\n### Strategy: Initiate a high-pressure zone!\n\nSnake #0 is higher up. If we can rush the center and control the vertical space, we can force him to the sides or into a vulnerable turning position. Let's aim UP and slightly LEFT to put pressure on his immediate space. The first apple at (5, 4) is a great target to grow early and start dictating the pace.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 0\n\nMy current position is (6, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. No walls, no bodies.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us closer to the middle, eyes on the (5, 4) apple.\n    *   **Enemy's likely moves at (5, 6):** He's probably going UP to (5, 7) for the apple or RIGHT to (6, 6) or LEFT to (4, 6) to gain space. If he goes UP, he grabs that (5, 7) apple. If he goes RIGHT to (6, 6), we are setting up a vertical confrontation.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us towards the bottom wall. Not aggressive enough! We want to control the center. Hard pass.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Directly moves towards the center and the apple (5, 4). This is a strong positional move.\n    *   **Comparison to UP:** If we go LEFT, we sacrifice vertical ground but get a better angle on the (5, 4) apple next turn (if we move UP to (5, 3)).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us towards the right wall. Too passive, gives the enemy free reign in the center.\n\n### The Decisive Move\n\nWe need to gain some ground quickly. The apple at (5, 4) is the first major point of conflict in our vicinity.\n\n*   If I go **UP** to (6, 3), I maintain my position relative to the right side but gain vertical height.\n*   If I go **LEFT** to (5, 2), I move directly towards the apple's column and challenge the enemy's central dominance sooner.\n\nGiven the enemy is at (5, 6), he's already in the '5' column. If I move LEFT to (5, 2), I establish parity in the $x$-axis and set up a direct vertical rush to (5, 4) or (5, 3) next turn. This feels more aggressive and direct than going UP first. Let's claim that central vertical column!\n\n**Prediction of Snake #0's move (5, 6):** He will likely move UP to (5, 7) to grab the apple or RIGHT to (6, 6) to gain space and challenge our right side. Either way, moving LEFT puts us right where we can pivot and climb.\n\n**Final Decision:** Move LEFT to put us in the (5, 2) column, directly below the first apple at (5, 4). This sets up a strong two-turn approach to growth and central control. We're going for the center rush, chat! This is the play!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Turn 1 & 2)\n\n1.  **Turn 1:** Now at (5, 2). Move UP to (5, 3).\n2.  **Turn 2:** Now at (5, 3). Move UP to (5, 4) and grab the apple! Start the domination!\n\nLet's assert dominance early!\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s clutch content right there!  \n- **Body situation?** We\u2019re the only snake alive, so no tail to worry about yet. Moving up gives us a fresh segment at (5,6) and puts us *one step closer* to the top of the board.  \n- **Future safety?** After the bite, we\u2019ll have a body behind us, so only 3 safe directions next turn (avoid going back). That\u2019s enough wiggle room to keep us flexible.  \n- **Opponent pressure?** Snake #1 is chilling at (6,2). If we keep climbing north, we\u2019ll be *far above* them, making it harder for them to sneak a head\u2011on collision or box us in from below. We can later swing left/right to cut off their path or force a double\u2011KO.  \n- **Multiple apple chase?** There\u2019s a sweet apple at (5,8) and (6,7) nearby. Growing now means we\u2019ll be ready to snatch those in the next few turns without getting stuck.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Long\u2011term plan (keep this in mind!):**  \n- **Turn\u202f1:** UP \u2192 eat (5,7).  \n- **Turn\u202f2:** If opponent moves UP, chase them north (maybe RIGHT to (6,7) for another apple).  \n- **Turn\u202f3+:** Aim for the apple at (5,8) while staying *one cell* above the opponent\u2019s potential path, then sweep left/right to cut them off. Keep the board open, grow fast, and force a head\u2011on showdown when we have the size edge.  \n\nNo more wasted moves, no holding back. Let\u2019s dominate the top\u2011right corner and make that rival regret ever stepping into our arena! \ud83c\udfc6  \n\nUP",

The enemy, Snake #0, already snagged an apple! **HE HAS A 1-0 SCORE LEAD!** Absolutely UNACCEPTABLE! We gotta retaliate!\n\n### Turn 1 Current Board Analysis\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (5, 2). Length 1.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (5, 7). Length 2! He moved UP from (5, 6) to (5, 7) and ate the apple! His body is now at (5, 6).\n*   **Closest Apple:** (5, 4). This is still our target! We are two squares below it.\n*   **The Conflict:** We are now in the same vertical column (x=5) as Snake #0! This is exactly what we wanted: control the center, but now it's a tight vertical race!\n\n### Enemy Posture and Intent\n\nSnake #0 just ate, so he's feeling good. He's tall, covering (5, 7) and (5, 6). He dominates the upper half of the '5' column.\n\n*   **Likely Enemy Moves from (5, 7):**\n    1.  **UP to (5, 8):** Continues climbing, safe, gets him near the (8, 9) or (3, 8) apples. (Not very likely since it\u2019s a dead-end direction unless he wants to get to the top edge).\n    2.  **LEFT to (4, 7):** Gains horizontal ground, eyes on (3, 8) or (2, 7) apples. This is a very strong move for him.\n    3.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Gains horizontal ground, eyes on the (6, 7) apple which is directly next to him! **This is the most aggressive and likely move!** If he goes RIGHT, he eats and grows to length 3.\n\n### Our Strategy: CLIMB AND CONTEST!\n\nWe need to close the score gap, and the apple at (5, 4) is perfectly positioned for us. We need to move UP.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 1\n\nMy current position is (5, 2).\n\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves away from the action. Absolutely NOT! We need to score! Eliminate.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us out of the '5' column. This is a passive move that gifts the enemy the central vertical axis. Not good right now.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us out of the '5' column. Similar to LEFT, ceding the vertical ground.\n\n4.  **UP to (5, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. We are moving into (5, 3). No part of the enemy body (5, 6), (5, 7) is near us.\n    *   **Goal:** Puts us one square away from the coveted (5, 4) apple! This is the essential move to catch up.\n\n### The Decisive Move & Confrontation Setup\n\nWe *must* move UP to (5, 3) to secure the (5, 4) apple next turn (Turn 2).\n\nWhat happens if the enemy moves?\n*   If Snake #0 goes LEFT to (4, 7) or RIGHT to (6, 7) (most likely), he leaves the '5' column at the top, freeing us to climb unchallenged. We grab the apple, score 1-1. We're back in the game!\n*   If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (5, 6), he commits suicide into his own body at (5, 6) (which is his new tail/old head). Wait, his head is at (5, 7) and his body is at (5, 6). If he moves DOWN, his head goes to (5, 6) and crashes right into his own body! **So, DOWN is not an option for him.** Safe!\n\nThe move is clear: We stick to the plan and climb! We will be at (5, 3) next turn, setting up the score! We're not letting him keep that lead, chat!\n\n### Short-Term Plan (Turn 2 & 3)\n\n1.  **Turn 2:** Move UP to (5, 4) and grab the apple! Score 1-1!\n2.  **Turn 3:** Now at (5, 4). The enemy will be highly active. We need to decide whether to push LEFT towards (4, 1) or consolidate position towards the right.\n\nUP",

We are about to tie this game up! $1-1$ in the score, baby! Let's get it! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n### Turn 2 Current Board State Analysis\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (5, 3). Length 1.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (5, 8). Length 2. Body at (5, 7). *Wait a minute, what happened?!*\n\nHold up, chat! Looking at the board, Snake #0's body is at (5, 7) and his head is at (5, 8). That means he moved UP in the last turn from (5, 7) to (5, 8)! He ate an apple earlier, he's feeling bold! He's at the very top of the '5' column!\n\n*   **The Apple Target:** The apple is still GLOWING at (5, 4)! It's ours for the taking!\n\n### Enemy Posture and Intent\n\nSnake #0 is currently at (5, 8), with his body stretching down to (5, 7). He's tall, but he's running out of room on the Y-axis.\n\n*   **Possible Enemy Moves from (5, 8):**\n    1.  **UP to (5, 9):** Safe. He gets another apple (A at (5, 9))! This is the MOST LIKELY and aggressive move. It grows him to length 3, and gets him a 2-0 lead.\n    2.  **LEFT to (4, 8):** Safe. Gets him close to the (3, 8) apple. A strong move, but he passes up the immediate score.\n    3.  **RIGHT to (6, 8):** Safe. No immediate threat or gain.\n    4.  **DOWN to (5, 7):** Kills himself! He runs right into his own body (which is currently at (5, 7))! Not happening!\n\n**CONCLUSION:** Snake #0 is almost certainly going UP to (5, 9) to snag that second apple! $2-0$ lead likely incoming! UNACCEPTABLE! We have to execute our move perfectly to minimize the damage!\n\n### Our Strategy: SECURE THE POINTS!\n\nOur goal hasn't changed: Get the (5, 4) apple.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 2 (Head at (5, 3))\n\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves away from the score. NOT an option!\n\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves away from the score. NO!\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves away from the score. NO!\n\n4.  **UP to (5, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. We are moving into (5, 4). The enemy is far, far away at (5, 8). No head clash is possible, no body collision is possible.\n    *   **Goal:** Eats the apple! We score our first point! Length becomes 2! Our score: 1. Enemy's expected score: 2.\n\nThis move is locked in, chat. We take the score! The enemy might get away with a score lead for one more turn, but we have established our presence in the center!\n\n### Short-Term Strategy (Turns 3-5)\n\nWe are now at (5, 4), length 2 (body at (5, 3)). The enemy is likely at (5, 9), length 3 (body at (5, 8), (5, 7)).\n\n1.  **Turn 3:** We are now between several apples: (4, 1), (3, 0), (8, 1), and slightly farther, (1, 5). The enemy has consolidated the top center. We need to decide:\n    *   Push UP and try to control the space below the enemy's tail at (5, 7)? Or...\n    *   Move HORIZONTALLY (Left or Right) to start controlling the mid-board. (6, 7) is a target to the right; (1, 5) to the left.\n2.  Since the enemy occupies (5, 7) and (5, 8) right now, staying in the '5' column is dangerous, as they might come down eventually. We should move to the side to give us options.\n3.  Let's look LEFT. Moving LEFT towards (4, 4) puts us on a path to the (4, 1) or (3, 0) apples.\n\n**Plan for Turn 3:** Move LEFT to (4, 4), opening up path control. We cannot let him corner us into the bottom right!\n\nLet's execute this move and worry about the trash-talking snake later! UP!\n\nUP",

Score is tied at 1-1, which is exactly where we want to be, ready to take the board! *Whew!*\n\nWait a minute, what happened to the enemy? Let's check the board state from the beginning of Turn 3!\n\n### Turn 3 Board State Analysis\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (5, 4). Length 2. Body at (5, 3).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (6, 8). Length 2. Body at (5, 8).\n    *   *Hold up, Chat!* The enemy moved from (5, 8) to (6, 8)! That means they moved **RIGHT**! They didn't go for the (5, 9) apple! UNEXPECTED! They've got fire in their belly, moving aggressively to the side!\n*   **The Apple Situation:** (1, 5), (4, 1), (3, 0), (8, 9), (3, 8), (0, 4), (8, 1), (2, 7), (0, 7), (1, 8), (2, 6), (8, 8), (6, 7), (7, 4), (8, 7).\n\nThe enemy is now at (6, 8), with his body trailing at (5, 8). They are threatening the apples at (6, 7), (8, 8), and (8, 9)! We need to control the mid-board ASAP!\n\n### Enemy Intent and Threat Assessment (Head at (6, 8))\n\nThe enemy is feeling bold! From (6, 8), they have a couple of VERY strong moves:\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):** Safe. No apple immediately, but puts them on a collision course with (8, 8) or (8, 9).\n2.  **UP to (6, 9):** Safe. Gets the apple at (8, 9) if the path is open. Wait, (8, 9) is kinda far. (6, 9) is empty space. No immediate score, but control. Still possible.\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 7):** **APPLE!** This is the biggest threat. If they move DOWN, they grab the apple at (6, 7) and grow to length 3, putting them at $2-1$ lead!\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 8):** **DEATH!** They run into their own body! NOPE.\n\n**Conclusion:** The enemy is most likely going **DOWN to (6, 7)** for the score! If we don't move aggressively now, we will fall behind again!\n\n### Our Strategy: Mid-Board Control and Future Apple Pathing\n\nOur head is at (5, 4), length 2 (body at (5, 3)). We are centrally located, which is GREAT. We need to move laterally to open up options and prepare to intercept or box the enemy later.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 3 (Head at (5, 4))\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us toward the enemy's path, but we are still 3 squares away from their current head (6, 8). If the enemy goes DOWN to (6, 7), we don't stop them, but we set ourselves nicely for the (8, 7) or (6, 7) apple on the rebound. A solid control move.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** We run into our own body! You already know the drill, Chat! NOT HAPPENING!\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us closer to the action! We get adjacent to the enemy's vertical line of attack. This is a very aggressive move that puts our head (6, 4) in the lane for future apples like (7, 4). Also sets up a cut if the enemy decides to come down the '6' column.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Opens up the path to apples on the left side: (4, 1), (3, 0), (0, 4), and (1, 5). This is the conservative, but strategically sound move to build up our length on the less contested side of the board.\n\n### The Head-to-Head Decision: Aggression vs. Safety\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 8). They are likely going to (6, 7).\n\n*   If we go **RIGHT to (6, 4)**, we are four squares below them. We're safe, but we don't stop the score. We are preparing to dominate the bottom-right quadrant later.\n*   If we go **LEFT to (4, 4)**, we are conceding the right side for now, but securing the left side. This ensures survival and growth.\n\n**Chat, we need length to dominate!** Conceding the immediate apple at (6, 7) is painful, but chasing the enemy up the board when they already have board position is a fool's game right now. We need to grow, solidify our position, and then come back for the kill!\n\nBy moving LEFT, we are positioning ourselves perfectly for the (4, 1) apple next turn, which keeps us scoring and growing. We are opening up the mid-left side, where there are fewer immediate enemy threats.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT, secure the left flank, and grow bigger than the competition. We will use our superior length to box him in by Turn 8!\n\n### Short-Term Strategy (Turns 4-6)\n\n1.  **Turn 4:** From (4, 4), move DOWN to (4, 3), preparing for the (4, 1) apple.\n2.  **Turn 5:** Move DOWN to (4, 2).\n3.  **Turn 6:** Move DOWN to (4, 1) and eat the apple! Grow to length 3!\nWe are prioritizing safety and growth on our flank. Let him have the top right for a few turns; we control the center and the left!\n\nLEFT",

They went straight for the score! As predicted in the last clip breakdown, Snake #0 went **DOWN** from (6, 8) to (6, 7) and grabbed the apple! They are now at a 2-1 lead! This is a tough spot, but we planned for this! We conceded the right side to secure the left!\n\n### Current Board State Analysis (Turn 4)\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (4, 4). Length 2. Body at (5, 4).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (6, 7). Length 3! Body is at (6, 8), (5, 8).\n*   **Score:** Snake #0 leads 2-1. Not ideal, but we are positioned for growth.\n\nWe need to execute the next phase of our plan: Secure the left flank and build length!\n\n### Enemy Intent and Threat Assessment (Head at (6, 7))\n\nThe enemy is feeling themselves, Chat! They just scored, and now they are at (6, 7). They have a couple of sweet targets nearby:\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):** **DEATH!** They smack their own tail! NOPE.\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Safe, but they have to contend with the (8, 7) or (8, 8) apples. A solid control move.\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 6):** Safe. No apple. Clears the way for a deeper dive into the board.\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 7):** Safe. Moves them closer to the center, threatening our side of the board! This is the most *aggressive* move, as it cuts laterally.\n\nSince they just scored, they might keep the momentum going by moving to (5, 7) to block us, or moving to (7, 7) to start dominating the top right corner where apples at (8, 7) and (8, 8) are.\n\n**Our Head is at (4, 4), and the enemy is at (6, 7). We have a solid diagonal separation.**\n\n### Our Strategy: Execute the Growth Plan!\n\nOur plan was to move aggressively towards the (4, 1) apple. From (4, 4), we have calculated the shortest non-suicidal path to the growth we desperately need!\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 4 (Head at (4, 4))\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us toward the central lanes (1, 5) apple. A solid defensive move, but it delays securing the (4, 1) apple.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** DIRECT path to the (4, 1) apple. This is the move we need to execute the growth plan! It is safe from head-on collisions, as the enemy is much further up the board. This is POGGERS!\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** We run into our own body (which is currently at (5, 4))! FAIL! No self-destruct moves, Chat!\n\n4.  **LEFT to (3, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us closer to the (3, 8) or (3, 0) apples. This is slightly slower for scoring than going for (4, 1). Why divert when we have a clear, safe target in line?\n\n### Conclusion: Go for the Score!\n\nWe are behind 2-1. We need to catch up! The (4, 1) apple is only three moves away if we commit now! Going **DOWN** is the only logical choice to continue our planned growth. This move is 100% safe, and puts us on the path to equalize the score. Let's make this content, Chat!\n\n### Short-Term Strategy (Turns 4-6) - UPDATED\n\n1.  **Turn 4 (NOW):** From (4, 4), move **DOWN to (4, 3)**.\n2.  **Turn 5:** Move DOWN to (4, 2).\n3.  **Turn 6:** Move DOWN to (4, 1) and eat the apple! Equalizer secured! We will be length 3!\n\nThis strategy is solid. It's safe, maximizes growth, and keeps us competitive! We're building a wall on the left side, and soon we'll snake around to box him in! Get ready for the comeback!\n\nDOWN",

Snake #0 moved from (6, 7) to **(7, 7)**! They are consolidating their dominance in the top-right corner.

We are closing the gap!\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to execute Phase 2: Grab the equalizer!\n\n### Enemy Intent and Threat Assessment (Head at (7, 7))\n\nThe enemy is feeling cozy at (7, 7). What are their options?\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** Safe. Moves toward (8, 8) and (8, 9) apples. High scoring potential.\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** **APPLE!** This is the most likely move.

NOPE.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is going **RIGHT** to (8, 7) to score their third apple. We need to focus on ourselves and secure our own score now!\n\n### Our Strategy: Execute the Growth Plan!\n\nOur plan was to move from (4, 3) to (4, 2), and then next turn to (4, 1) for the apple! We must stick to the plan and prioritize growth!\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 5 (Head at (4, 3))\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** We run into our own body! No way, Chat!

It is 100% safe from the enemy, who is far away at (7, 7). This move maintains control of the central column. THIS IS THE MOVE!\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** A lateral move. While safe, it diverts us from our immediate scoring objective. It gives the enemy too much time to build length. We must score *now*.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (3, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Also a diversion. Moves us toward the (3, 0) or (3, 8) apples, but the (4, 1) apple is *right there*.\n\n### Conclusion: Stay the Course and Go Down!\n\nWe are two moves from an equalizer and increased length. The enemy is focused on the far right. This is our window! Sticking to the plan is the best way to secure victory. Going **DOWN** to (4, 2) sets us up perfectly for the score next turn.

Equalizer secured! Length 3!\n3.  **Turn 7:** We will be at (4, 1). We can then push **LEFT** toward (3, 0) or potentially **UP** to (4, 2), depending on the enemy's position, to secure the center line and start looking for the next apple, perhaps (3, 0).\n\nLet's execute!

We are perfectly positioned for greatness!\n\n### Board State and Score Check (Turn 6)\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (4, 2). Length 2. Body at (4, 3).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (8, 7). Length 4! They just scored!\n*   **Enemy Body:** (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8). (They moved RIGHT from (7, 7) to (8, 7) and ate the apple! That snake is getting LONG!)\n*   **Score:** Snake #0 leads 3-1. Time for the comeback, Chat! We need to score NOW!\n\nThe enemy is dominating the top-right quarter of the board, now stretched out almost horizontally. They are big and pose a serious threat, but they are far away. We need that equalizer apple!\n\n### Enemy Intent and Threat Assessment (Head at (8, 7))\n\nThe enemy is fat, happy, and long at (8, 7). What are their likely moves?\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):** **APPLE!** Highly likely. They want to maintain their scoring streak and get to length 5.\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Safe, but no immediate apple. Moves them toward the (8, 9) apple path.\n3.  **DOWN to (8, 6):** Safe, no apple. Retreating, unlikely.\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 7):** **DEATH!** Runs into their own body! NOPE.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is going **UP** to (8, 8). We need to score and match their length before they gain an insurmountable advantage!\n\n### Our Strategy: Equalize the Score, Maintain the Center!\n\nOur plan from last turn was simple: Move **DOWN** to (4, 1) and eat the apple at (4, 1). This is our chance! We need to execute the plan and secure our length and score!\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 6 (Head at (4, 2))\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** We run into our own body! Absolutely not!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** **APPLE!** We score, we grow to length 3, and we equalize the scoreboard to 2-3 (Apple difference). This is the key move. It opens up the path to the (3, 0) apple next if we want it. THIS IS THE MOVE!\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves away from the apple. Why would we do that, Chat? Are we throwing? No way!\n\n4.  **LEFT to (3, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us closer to the (3, 0) apple, but misses the (4, 1) apple this turn. We must prioritize the immediate score!\n\n### Conclusion: Secure the Bag!\n\nThe move is crystal clear, Chat! We are going **DOWN** to (4, 1) to grab that apple, grow our snake, and close the gap on the scoreboard! Snake #0 is focused on the far top-right. We are safe to score!\n\n### Short-Term Strategy (Turns 6-8) - Locked In!\n\n1.  **Turn 6 (NOW):** From (4, 2), move **DOWN to (4, 1)** and EAT THE APPLE! Length 3!\n2.  **Turn 7 (After Score):** We will be at (4, 1). Our body will be at (4, 2), (4, 3). We should look to consolidate position or go for the next nearest apple, which is (3, 0). A move like **LEFT** to (3, 1) would set us up perfectly.\n3.  **Turn 8:** Move **DOWN** to (3, 0) for another score! We will be coming back!\n\nLet's do this! Score time!

No wall, no self\u2011collision, no enemy body. It\u2019s a clean bite that instantly widens our body and pulls us closer to the top\u2011row apple at (8,\u202f9).  \n- **DOWN** (to\u202f(8,\u202f6)) \u2013 \u2705 Safe, but it\u2019s a dead\u2011end walkway. No apple, same narrow corridor, and it lets the opponent slip around on the left side without us ever blocking them.  \n- **RIGHT** (to\u202f(9,\u202f7)) \u2013 \u2705 Safe but risky. Flushing us against the right wall squeezes our turning options and gives #1 a wide open path on the left. It\u2019s a \u201cstay\u2011still\u201d move that won\u2019t grow us.  \n- **LEFT** (to\u202f(7,\u202f7)) \u2013 \ud83d\udeab *Back\u2011track!* That square is occupied by our own neck segment (7,\u202f7). A head\u2011on with ourselves = instant death. Don\u2019t even think about it.  \n\n\ud83e\udd14 **Why give up the juicy apple?**  \nBecause when we **UP** we grab the \ud83c\udf4e at (8,\u202f8) and instantly jump from 3 to 4 apples \u2013 widening our lead to 3\u202f\u2013\u202f2 (or 4\u202f\u2013\u202f1 once we eat). The extra segment makes our body a flexible \u201cwall\u201d we can later swing left to choke #1.  \n\n\ud83c\udf31 **Future\u2011proofing:**  \nAfter eating (8,\u202f8) we\u2019ll be at (8,\u202f8) with a 5\u2011segment snake:  \nHead\u202f(8,\u202f8) \u2192 (8,\u202f7) \u2192 (7,\u202f7) \u2192 (6,\u202f7) \u2192 (6,\u202f8).  \nFrom there we can **UP** again next turn to snag the apple at (8,\u202f9) (the top\u2011right corner) and keep expanding upward. Once we\u2019re a long vertical line, we can pivot **LEFT** and **DOWN** to trap #1 against the left wall, especially when they try to escape via column\u202f5 or head for the apple at (4,\u202f1). Remember, #1 can\u2019t go **UP** because that would smash into its own tail, so we own the high ground.  \n\n\ud83e\udde9 **Short\u2011term plan:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f6 (now): **UP** \u2192 eat \ud83c\udf4e at (8,\u202f8).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f7: **UP** \u2192 eat \ud83c\udf4e at (8,\u202f9).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f8: **LEFT** \u2192 start bending our body toward column\u202f7, building a cage that blocks #1\u2019s rightward escape.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f9+\u202f: Keep moving **LEFT/DOWN** to force #1 into column\u202f4 where our longer length guarantees a head\u2011on smash.  \n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **Safety check:** After Turn\u202f6\u2019s **UP**, we\u2019ll still have three viable moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP again) \u2013 no imminent self\u2011kill. That keeps our options open for the next steps.  \n\n\u26a1 **Final decision:**  \n\nUP",

Let's check the board and see how we can box this archrival in!\n\n### Board State and Score Check (Turn 7)\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (4, 1). Length 3. Body: [(4, 2), (4, 3)]. We are focused!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (8, 8). Length 5! They *also* scored! They are long!\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8)]. They are spread across the top-right corner.\n*   **Score:** Snake #0 leads 4-2. Still a deficit, but we are growing! We gotta catch up before they completely dominate the board space!\n\nThe enemy is big and now controls a huge chunk of the top right: (6, 7) through (8, 8). We need to leverage our position in the bottom center to grab more apples and start cutting off their retreat paths.\n\n### Enemy Intent and Threat Assessment (Head at (8, 8))\n\nThe enemy is now at (8, 8) and is super long. What are their likely moves?\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 9):** **APPLE!** Highly likely. They want to maintain their scoring streak and get to length 6. This is the obvious move.\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):** Safe, but no apple. Moves them along the wall.\n3.  **DOWN to (8, 7):** **DEATH!** Runs into their own body! NOPE.\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 8):** Safe, but no immediate apple. Moves them toward the center.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is almost certainly going **UP** to (8, 9) to score again. This is good for us, as it keeps them focused on the perimeter, leaving the rest of the board open for us!\n\n### Our Strategy: Dominate the Bottom, Target the (3, 0) Apple!\n\nOur previous plan was to move from (4, 1) to (3, 1) and then to (3, 0). This still feels like the strongest play. The (3, 0) apple is currently undefended and crucial for our score!\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 7 (Head at (4, 1))\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** Runs into our own new body segment! No, Chat, we are NOT throwing!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us further into the corner, which gives us fewer immediate options. It keeps us near the (3, 0) apple but requires a horizontal move first. If we wait, we could risk a trap.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us away from the current apple goal (3, 0). Why would we move right? No value here.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (3, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** This perfectly positions us for the next turn! We move one step closer to the (3, 0) apple, and we keep the vertical options open (DOWN to score, UP to (3, 2) to maneuver if needed). This move continues the strategy!\n\n### Collision Check and Enemy Awareness\n\nThe enemy is entirely in the far top right. There is absolutely zero risk of a head-on collision or crashing into their body this turn. We are free to execute our scoring plan!\n\n### Conclusion: Execute the Plan and Get the Score!\n\nWe are going **LEFT** to (3, 1). This is the setup for the next apple! Two moves and we are tied (or just one point behind, depending on how many apples they grab next)!\n\n### Short-Term Strategy (Turns 7-9) - Focus on Equalizing!\n\n1.  **Turn 7 (NOW):** From (4, 1), move **LEFT to (3, 1)**. Set up the attack!\n2.  **Turn 8:** From (3, 1), move **DOWN to (3, 0)** and EAT THE APPLE! Length 4! Score 3-4! Comeback time!\n3.  **Turn 9:** We will be at (3, 0). Look to move up the left side of the board for apples at (0, 4) and (1, 5). A move **UP** to (3, 1) or **LEFT** to (2, 0) seems ideal.\n\nLEFT",

Meanwhile #1 is stuck chasing apples in the lower\u2011left (3,0) or (2,7) zones, and can\u2019t climb the top row without a huge detour.  \n\n\ud83e\udde9 **Short\u2011term plan:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f6:** **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,\u202f8) \ud83c\udf4e +1 (length\u202f5)  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f7:** **LEFT** \u2192 (8,\u202f8) \ud83c\udf4e +1 (length\u202f6) \u2013 we\u2019re now a tight vertical line at the top\u2011right corner.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f8:** **UP** \u2192 (8,\u202f9) \ud83c\udf4e +1 (length\u202f7) \u2013 expand upward while the board opens.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f9+\u202f:** Keep **LEFT/DOWN** to push a horizontal wall across the top row, forcing #1 into the left side where our longer body guarantees a *force\u2011feed* kill if they dare to cross.  \n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **Safety check:** After RIGHT we have three viable follow\u2011ups (LEFT, UP, DOWN) and no imminent self\u2011collision. Opponent\u2019s head can\u2019t reach (9,\u202f8) in a single move \u2013 they\u2019d need at least 5 turns to crawl over from column\u202f4 to column\u202f9, giving us plenty of breathing room.  \n\n**TIME TO CLAIM THE BITE!**  \n\n**RIGHT**",

We are LOCKED IN, ready to snag that apple at (3, 0) and close the score gap! LET'S GOOO!\n\n### Board State and Score Check (Turn 8)\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (3, 1). Length 3. **Body:** [(4, 1), (4, 2)]. We are focused!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (9, 8). Length 6! They successfully scored that (8, 9) apple! They are LONGER!\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8)]. They are hugging that top-right wall.\n*   **Score:** Snake #0 leads 4-2. We MUST score this turn to make it 4-3!\n\nThe enemy is aggressively patrolling the top right. We are in the bottom center. There is no immediate collision risk, so we are free to execute our scoring plan!\n\n### Our Strategy: Execute the Score, Then Orient Left!\n\nOur plan was to move DOWN from (3, 1) to (3, 0) to grab the apple! Is this still safe? YES!\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 8 (Head at (3, 1))\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us away from the apple at (3, 0). Why would we move away from content, Chat? We aren't doing that!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** **APPLE!** This is safe and scores immediately! This is the move, Chat! Pure brilliance!\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** Runs into our own body segment! NOPE! We're not throwing the game on a self-collision!\n\n4.  **LEFT to (2, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us toward the (0, 4) and (1, 5) apples, which is good for the long term, but skips the immediate score at (3, 0). We take the guaranteed points first!\n\n### Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (Head at (9, 8))\n\nThe enemy is now at (9, 8). Where are they going next?\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 9):** Safe. No apple. Continues perimeter patrol.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 7):** Safe. No apple. Moves them down the wall.\n3.  **RIGHT to (10, 8):** **DEATH!** Off the board! Not likely.\n4.  **LEFT to (8, 8):** **DEATH!** Runs into their own body! Not likely.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is likely going **UP to (9, 9)** to maximize space on the wall, or **DOWN to (9, 7)** to continue their patrol along the right edge. Regardless, they are nowhere near us. We are safe!\n\n### Conclusion: Score the Point!\n\nWe are going **DOWN** to (3, 0). Get the score, get the growth, and prepare to move toward the center-left. Time to catch up!\n\n### Short-Term Strategy (Turns 9-11) - Chase the Lead!\n\n1.  **Turn 8 (NOW):** From (3, 1), move **DOWN to (3, 0)** and EAT THE APPLE! Length 4! Score 3-4!\n2.  **Turn 9:** We will be at (3, 0). Look to move **UP to (3, 1)** or **LEFT to (2, 0)**. We need to navigate left towards the (0, 4) or (1, 5) apples. Moving UP to (3, 1) keeps us central and gives us options to maneuver around our own growing body.\n3.  **Turn 10:** If we are at (3, 1), we should consider moving towards the (0, 4) or (1, 5) apple to maintain the scoring momentum.

Wait, they are longer than us because they scored an apple previously, and their tail segment (6, 7) from the previous turn would have disappeared if they hadn't scored. HMM. Let's re-verify their length count.\n    *   *Previous Turn 8:* Head (9, 8). Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8)]. Length 6.\n    *   *Current Turn 9:* Head (9, 9). Body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)]. Length 5.\n    *   AH, they did *not* score an apple at (9, 9) because there isn't one listed there in the APPLE DROPS for this turn. They just moved UP. They are currently Length 5.\n    *   **Length Check:** We are Length 4. Enemy is Length 5. They are one segment longer than us. We need to score again FAST!\n*   **Score:** Snake #0 leads 4-3.\n\nThe enemy is aggressively patrolling the top right corner. They aren't near us. We need to leverage our growth and start heading left to dominate the center.\n\n### Our Strategy: Move Left, Dominate the Center-Left\n\nWe are at (3, 0). There's an apple at (0, 4) and (1, 5). We need to get there without trapping ourselves.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 9 (Head at (3, 0))\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** Runs directly into our body segment (3, 1)! We just came from here! Chat, we are NOT throwing by running backward into ourselves! NOPE!\n    *   *Rule Reminder:* If your current head position is (x, y) and your body segment is (x', y'), if (x', y') is the position your head occupied in the *immediately* preceding turn, moving back there is usually collision with the body, unless you scored an apple. Since we *just* scored the apple at (3, 0), the location (3, 1) is now the second segment of our body, not the tail. Moving to (3, 1) would be crashing into our own body. (3, 1) is currently the segment *behind* the head. This is a fatal collision!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, -1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** Off the bottom of the board! Not happening!\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us toward the right, away from the immediate apples at (0, 4) and (1, 5). Keeps us open but less focused.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (2, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** The perfect move! Keeps us along the bottom row, moves us toward the open left side of the board, and positions us to ascend toward the (0, 4) or (1, 5) apples. This maximizes our future options and aggressive scoring!\n\nSafe moves are RIGHT and LEFT. We choose LEFT for aggressive positioning!\n\n### Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (Head at (9, 9))\n\nThe enemy is at (9, 9). Where are they going next?\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 10):** **DEATH!** Off the top! Not likely.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 8):** Safe. No apple. Moves them back down the wall.\n3.  **RIGHT to (10, 9):** **DEATH!** Off the right! Not likely.\n4.  **LEFT to (8, 9):** **APPLE!** Massive priority. This is the most likely move! They will score and extend their lead 5-3, becoming Length 6.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is moving **LEFT to (8, 9)**. This is far away from us, so there is no immediate threat of collision.\n\n### Conclusion: Time to Go West!\n\nWe are going **LEFT** to (2, 0) to reposition for the next wave of content!\n\n### Short-Term Strategy (Turns 10-12) - Center Control!\n\n1.  **Turn 9 (NOW):** From (3, 0), move **LEFT to (2, 0)**. Length 4.\n2.  **Turn 10:** We will be at (2, 0). The apple at (0, 4) is our target. We should move **UP to (2, 1)**. This keeps us safe from our body at (3, 0) and gets us centrally located.\n3.  **Turn 11:** From (2, 1), we move **UP to (2, 2)**.

Let's check the board!\n\n### Turn 10 Analysis: Score Check and Board State\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head is at (2, 0). Length 4: [(3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)].\n    *   *Last move review:* We moved LEFT from (3, 0) to (2, 0). Beautiful! This was exactly the repositioning we needed.\n*   **ENEMY SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at (8, 9). Length 6: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)].\n    *   *Score Check:* The enemy's head is at (8, 9), and there's an apple (A) there! They **must have scored** last turn, leading 5-3 now! Their length is now 6. Our prediction they would move to the apple at (8, 9) was spot on! Wait, the provided state shows their head at (8, 9) and their body starting at (9, 9). This means their current head is (8, 9), and they came from (9, 9) where they scored the apple.\n    *   **Scoreboard Confirmation:** They are at 5 apples, we are at 3. They are LENGTH 6. We are LENGTH 4. We are significantly shorter and need to CATCH UP or we're going to get BOXED!\n\nThe enemy is dominating the top-right quarter of the board. We control the bottom-left corner. It's time to leverage our position and get some CONTENT!\n\n### Target Acquisition\n\nWe are at (2, 0). Immediate nearby apples:\n1.  (0, 4) - 2 moves away.\n2.  (1, 5) - 3 moves away.\n3.  (0, 7) - 4 moves away.\n\nOur goal is to score (0, 4) or (1, 5) fast to get our length up.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 10 (Head at (2, 0))\n\n1.  **LEFT to (1, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Gets us closer to the Y-axis. Excellent for setting up the move to (0, 4).\n    *   **Con:** Keeps us on the dangerous bottom row which limits vertical escape options if we need them.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (3, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** This is the immediate segment of our body behind the head! (3, 0) is occupied. We just came from there when we moved LEFT. We cannot run backwards unless the tail has moved out fast enough, which it hasn't since we just ate an apple. (3, 0) is occupied by the second segment of our body. Collision!\n\n3.  **DOWN to (2, -1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** Off the board! NOPE.\n\n4.  **UP to (2, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Immediate vertical gain. Positions us beautifully to zig-zag toward (0, 4) or (1, 5). This is the move we planned in the last turn's rationale!\n    *   **Con:** It slightly delays *reaching* the apple at (0, 4) compared to moving LEFT, but it provides significantly more vertical space and safety for the future move choices.\n\n### Strategic Decision: UP for Vertical Dominance\n\nMoving UP to (2, 1) is the safest and most optimal move for keeping our options open while making vertical progress toward the center-left cluster of apples. We need to get off the bottom wall!\n\n### Collision Check and Enemy Prediction (Enemy Head at (8, 9))\n\nThe enemy is super far away, so no risk of immediate head-on collision.\n\nWhere will Snake #0 move next? They are at (8, 9), they are long (6 segments), and they just scored.\n*   They could go **LEFT to (7, 9)** (no apple).\n*   They could go **DOWN to (8, 8)** (runs into their own body segment (8, 8)! **DEATH!** NOPE, they can't do that, (8, 8) is their third body segment).\n*   They could go **RIGHT to (9, 9)** (no apple, but runs back to the corner they just scored at).\n*   They could go **UP** (off the board).\n\nThe best moves for them are RIGHT or LEFT. Since they've been patrolling the top wall, moving **LEFT to (7, 9)** seems strategically sound to check the next corner. They are far from us, so we just focus on CONTENT!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Turns 10-13) - Secure the Left\n\n1.  **Turn 10 (NOW):** From (2, 0), move **UP to (2, 1)**.\n2.  **Turn 11:** From (2, 1), move **UP to (2, 2)**. We are positioning.\n3.  **Turn 12:** From (2, 2), move **LEFT to (1, 2)** or **UP to (2, 3)**. We will decide based on the enemy's movement, but (0, 4) is still the main target. We could also aim for (1, 5).\n4.  **Turn 13:** Position to score (0, 4) or (1, 5). We MUST score to catch up in length!\n\nUP is the only answer, CHAT! Let's get this content!\n\nUP",

Length 4: Body at [(2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)].\n    *   We successfully moved to (2, 1), getting off the wall. The tail at (3, 1) should be gone, as a segment has dropped off the back (we did not eat an apple).\n*   **ENEMY SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at (7, 9). Length 6: Body at [(8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)].\n    *   Looks like they moved LEFT from (8, 9) to (7, 9). They are still locked into that top-right quadrant. We need to capitalize on the open space!\n*   **Score Check:** Opponent 5 apples (Length 6). Us 3 apples (Length 4). We are still significantly behind and need to score two apples *minimum* to even the scales in length.\n\nOur last turn's strategic goal was to move UP toward the left-side apples. We are now at (2, 1).\n\n### Target Acquisition\n\nWe are at (2, 1). Immediate reachable apples:\n1.  **(0, 4):** 3 moves away (L, U, U or U, L, U or similar).\n2.  **(1, 5):** 3 moves away (L, U, U or U, U, L).\n3.  **(2, 7):** 6 moves away (straight UP).\n\nThe target remains (0, 4) or (1, 5). We need to gain altitude fast.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 11 (Head at (2, 1))\n\n1.  **LEFT to (1, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Immediate progress toward the Y-axis. Sets up a clean path to (0, 4).\n    *   **Con:** Keeps us low on the board.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (3, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (3, 1) was our tail segment which should now be FREE since we didn't eat an apple last turn. Our body is now [(2, 0), (3, 0)].\n    *   **Pro/Con:** Moves us back toward the corner we just escaped. Not the best strategic direction for scoring or expansion.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (2, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** This is the cell immediately behind our head, segment 1 of our body! We just moved UP from here. Collision! NOPE.\n\n4.  **UP to (2, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Maximum vertical movement, keeping us in wide-open territory. Sets up the next move beautifully for either (1, 5) or (0, 4). This maintains our planned path for vertical dominance.\n\n### Strategic Decision: UP for Altitude\n\nWe need to keep the pressure going UP. Moving to (2, 2) secures a central column position for the next move, allowing us to pivot LEFT or continue UP, maximizing our options.\n\n### Collision Check and Enemy Prediction (Enemy Head at (7, 9))\n\nThe enemy is still at (7, 9). They are confined by the top wall and their own large body starting at (8, 9).\n\n*   They could move **LEFT to (6, 9)** (Apple A!). This is a HUGE scoring threat. If they move here, they get their 6th point and grow to length 7.\n*   They could move **DOWN to (7, 8)** (no apple, safe).\n*   They could move **RIGHT to (8, 9)** (collision with their own body segment! DEATH! NOPE.)\n\nThey will almost certainly move **LEFT to (6, 9)** to score that apple! We are nowhere near them, so no immediate danger. Our focus is pure CONTENT!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Turns 11-14) - Secure the Left\n\n1.  **Turn 11 (NOW):** From (2, 1), move **UP to (2, 2)**.

Going LEFT is probably better now.\n3.  **Turn 13:** Position to score (0, 4) or (1, 5).\n4.  **Turn 14:** SCORE! Get that length advantage back!\n\nWe are going UP, CHAT! Let's follow the plan!\n\nUP",

LET'S GOOO!\n\n### Turn 12 Analysis: Score Check and Board State\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head is at **(2, 2)**. Length 4. Body: [(2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0)].\n    *   We are now in a fantastic spot, right in the main channel. We can pivot left or continue up.\n*   **ENEMY SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at **(6, 9)**. Length 7 (They GOT the apple!). Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)].\n    *   I called it, CHAT! They moved LEFT from (7, 9) to (6, 9) and snagged that apple. They now have 6 apples and are length 7. They are HUGE and occupying the top right. We are down 3 apples and 3 segments. We need to score, and we need to score NOW!\n\n*   **Score Check:** Opponent 6 apples (Length 7). Us 3 apples (Length 4). The deficit is GROWING! We need to stop them from securing the top lane.\n\n### Target Acquisition\n\nWe are at (2, 2). Immediate reachable apples:\n1.  **(0, 4):** 3 moves away (L, U, U).\n2.  **(1, 5):** 4 moves away (L, U, U, U).\n3.  **(3, 2):** 1 move RIGHT! This is a CLUTCH apple!\n\nWait, chat, HYPE CHECK! My strategic plan was to go for the left apples (0, 4) and (1, 5), but there's a sneaky apple at **(3, 2)**, just one move to the right! Why would we ignore free content? We need to grow, right? RIGHT!\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 12 (Head at (2, 2))\n\n1.  **LEFT to (1, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Continues our strategic push toward the high-value (0, 4) and (1, 5) apples. It sets up a follow-up move UP or LEFT.\n    *   **Con:** Delays the immediate score available at (3, 2).\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (3, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** **INSTANT SCORE!** We collect our 4th apple and grow to length 5. This is HUGE for our length deficit.\n    *   **Con:** Once we eat the apple, we are at (3, 2). Our body will be [(2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)]. This positions us more centrally, but maybe slightly low for the next score rush.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (2, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** This is the cell immediately behind our head, segment 1 of our body! Collision! NOPE.\n\n4.  **UP to (2, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Maximize vertical movement. This is good positioning for the long game. The apple (0, 4) is 3 moves away.\n    *   **Con:** Delays the instant score at (3, 2).\n\n### Strategic Decision: GO FOR THE INSTA-SCORE!\n\nThe opponent is long (length 7) and currently stuck in the corner. Their next move is likely DOWN to (6, 8) or perhaps RIGHT to (7, 9) if they are feeling aggressive/lucky (7, 9 is segment 1 of their body, so they can't go there unless it is a tail move... wait, the tail is at (8, 7) right now, which means (7, 9) is still safe, but it's segment 1 of their current body [(7, 9), ...]. NOPE, they cannot move to (7, 9)! It is the segment *right behind* (6, 9) in the body list. They are limited to DOWN or LEFT.)\n\nIf they are smart, they go DOWN to (6, 8) to secure freedom, or LEFT to (5, 9) to search for the next apple. They are far away, so our move is purely offensive and positioning.\n\nWe need to close the 3-segment gap. The apple at (3, 2) is the most efficient way to do that. It is content, it is growth, it is the play!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Turns 12-15) - Regrow and Box\n\n1.  **Turn 12 (NOW):** Move **RIGHT to (3, 2)** and score the apple. Length 5.\n2.  **Turn 13:** From (3, 2), move **UP to (3, 3)**. Maintaining central position.\n3.  **Turn 14:** Pivot LEFT to (2, 3) or (1, 3) to threaten (0, 4) or (1, 5).\n4.  **Turn 15:** Score another apple. We need to catch up!\n\nLet's secure this point, CHAT! We need to grow, grow, grow!\n\nRIGHT",

CRASH! NOPE!\n2.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Opens up the board to the right.\n    *   **Con:** Moves us away from the high-priority apple at (3, 4). Seems inefficient right now.\n3.  **DOWN to (3, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** None. This moves us away from content and boxes us potentially against the bottom wall.\n    *   **Con:** Loss of vertical advantage.\n4.  **UP to (3, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** This is the direct route toward the critical apple at (3, 4). It is a perfect positional move, centralizing us and preparing for the score. It allows us to pivot left or right on Turn 14 depending on the enemy's vertical push.\n    *   **Con:** None, this is the optimal move.\n\n### Strategy: The Vertical Push\n\nWe must secure the apple at (3, 4) right now while the opponent is still locked into the top row battle. Our plan from last turn holds: UP to position for the next meal!\n\nTurn 13: UP to (3, 3).\nTurn 14: UP to (3, 4) to score. Length 6.\nTurn 15: Pivot R or L depending on enemy movement. Maybe R towards (7, 4) or L towards (2, 6).\n\nIf we continue to grow quickly, we will match the opponent's length, which is crucial for dictating turf battles later. Let's maximize our efficient apple pathing!\n\nUP",

The pressure is ON! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### Turn 14 Analysis: Current State (The Setup Turn)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head is at **(3, 3)**. Length 5. Body: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)].\n    *   We are positioned perfectly for the apple at **(3, 4)**. We need to go UP.\n*   **ENEMY SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at **(4, 9)**. Length 7. Body: [(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)].\n    *   The opponent moved LEFT from (5, 9) to (4, 9). They are still locked up top, controlling the 9th row. They are long and dangerous but far away. No immediate threat!\n\n*   **Score Check:** Opponent 6 apples (Length 7). Us 4 apples (Length 5). If we score this turn, we are 5 apples (Length 6). The gap closes to 1! LET'S GO FOR THE SNATCH!\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 14 (Head at (3, 3))\n\nOur goal is simple: secure the apple at (3, 4) and pivot for the next target.\n\n1.  **LEFT to (2, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Opens up the path to apples (2, 6) or (0, 4).\n    *   **Con:** Ignores the immediate high-value apple at (3, 4). Slower path to content.\n2.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (Note: Enemy Head at (4, 9) is 6 squares away. No collision threat.)\n    *   **Pro:** Positions us centrally.\n    *   **Con:** Ignores the immediate high-value apple at (3, 4).\n3.  **DOWN to (3, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH!** This is our body segment 1 (the cell we just left). Instant crash! WE ARE NOT DOING THAT!\n4.  **UP to (3, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** **APPLE SECURED!** We eat the apple, grow to length 6, and close the score gap. This is the optimal, game-changing move.\n    *   **Con:** None. This is the play!\n\n### Aggressor Strategy Update: Box the Enemy!\n\nOnce we hit (3, 4) this turn, we need to immediately pivot toward the center or right and start applying vertical pressure while the opponent is trapped horizontally up top.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 15+):**\n1.  **Turn 14 (Current):** UP to (3, 4) (Score! Length 6).\n2.  **Turn 15:** We will be at (3, 4). We need to decide if we push LEFT toward (2, 6) or (0, 4), or push RIGHT toward (7, 4). Given the opponent is still consolidating the top left, a move to the RIGHT (away from the enemy's potential push zone) and toward (7, 4) seems safer to maintain growth advantage. We will plan to go RIGHT or UP to (3, 5) to claim more vertical space. The enemy is still very far, so we prioritize the closest safe growth opportunities.\n\nThe move is clear, Chat! We are hungry, and the apple is ripe! PUSH UP!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 15! Did you see that clean sweep? We got the apple at (3, 4)! Score is now 5 to 6! We are right on his heels, pushing the tempo! He's starting to sweat, Chat, confirmed! \ud83e\udd76\n\n### Turn 15 Analysis: The Pressure Point\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head is at **(3, 4)**. Length 6. Body: [(3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)].\n    *   We are now positioned centrally, slightly low, ready to dominate the mid-board.\n*   **ENEMY SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at **(3, 9)**. Length 7. Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9)].\n    *   The opponent last moved LEFT from (4, 9) to (3, 9). They are now sitting just above the mid-upper region. They are very long and occupying the entire top row from (3, 9) to (9, 9).\n    *   **CRITICAL OBSERVATION:** The enemy is now close to leaving the top row confinement, likely aiming DOWN toward (3, 8) (an apple!) or (2, 9) (an apple!) or (2, 8).\n\n*   **Immediate Threat Check:** Can the enemy reach us? No. They are at (3, 9). We are at (3, 4). They need 5 moves to reach our line (if they move straight down). We are safe for now, but we need to watch out for their expansion.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Turn 15 (Head at (3, 4))\n\nOur goal now is two-fold: maintain growth and start cutting off the enemy's options if they decide to come down the middle.\n\n1.  **LEFT to (2, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (Body segment at (2, 2) is safe.)\n    *   **Pro:** Moves toward apples at (2, 6) or (0, 4). Opens up the left vertical lane.\n2.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Positions us centrally/right. Moves toward apples at (7, 4) and (9, 4). This could be beneficial if the enemy commits to the left side.\n3.  **DOWN to (3, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** **RISKY!** (3, 3) is our immediately preceding body segment. This means if we do *not* eat an apple this turn, we are moving into that segment which still exists until the tail drops off! Since we ate last turn, our tail did *not* move from (2, 0). The *next* tail position would be (2, 0) still if we don't eat.\n        *   Wait, let's look at the body list. My body is [(3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)]. (3, 3) is the cell right behind the head. Moving UP into (3, 4) last turn made (3, 3) the new segment 1. We ARE **DEAD** if we move DOWN into (3, 3). No self-collision, Chat! We don't make rookie mistakes! \ud83d\ude45 **ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **UP to (3, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Moves toward the apple at (3, 5) (immediate content!). This also puts us directly underneath the enemy, allowing us to contest their movement. If they go DOWN to (3, 8) or (3, 7), we are positioned to box them in or start an aggressive move.\n\n### The Strategy Pick: Vertical Contest\n\nThe apple at (3, 5) is perfectly placed. If we take it, we tie the score 6-6 and increase our length to 7, matching the enemy. This is the definition of a power move!\n\nFurthermore, moving *UP* to (3, 5) forces the enemy to respect our vertical position. The enemy is long and slow up there. If they try to drop down, we can maneuver and use our size advantage and agility to cut them off.\n\n*   If we go UP to (3, 5), and the enemy goes DOWN to (3, 8), they are still 3 squares away.\n*   If the enemy goes LEFT to (2, 9) (another apple) or RIGHT to (4, 9), they are still moving horizontally, giving us more time to grow.\n\nTaking the immediate apple at (3, 5) is the highest-value, high-safety move. We are going for the tie, Chat! Let's get aggressive and gain length supremacy!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 16+):**\n1.  **Turn 15 (Current):** UP to (3, 5) (Score! Length 7). Tie game!\n2.  **Turn 16:** We will be at (3, 5). The enemy will likely be at (X, 8) or (X, 9). We will assess the board from (3, 5). If (0, 4) or (2, 6) is available, we push LEFT to avoid the vertical line the enemy might be taking down (e.g., column 3). If the enemy moves away, we keep pushing UP/RIGHT toward content at (7, 4) or (6, 8) to secure board control on the right side. For now, the focus is on maintaining agility and getting that next apple.\n\nWe are taking the apple. We are tying the game. Pushing UP!\n\nUP",

They're still stuck up top, trying to figure out how to navigate their big ol' body!\n\n### Turn 16 Board Analysis\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head is at **(3, 5)**. Length 7. Body: [(3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)].\n    *   We are positioned perfectly in column 3, dividing the board horizontally.\n*   **ENEMY SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at **(2, 9)**. Length 7. Body: [(3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9)].\n    *   The enemy moved LEFT from (3, 9) to (2, 9) (they didn't eat the apple at (2, 9) though, that spot is marked as '0' - wait, the board state shows 0 at (2, 9). Did they just move over their own previous head position? No, their previous body was (3, 9). The board state shows the head at (2, 9)).\n    *   **Wait, let's re-examine the board state and the enemy body list:**\n        *   Enemy Head: (2, 9).\n        *   Enemy Body: [(3, 9), (4, 9)...(9, 9)].\n        *   Board shows: `9 . . 0 T T T T T T T` (This confirms their head is at (2, 9) and their body occupies (3, 9) through (9, 9)).\n    *   They are still pinned to the top wall. This is exactly what we want!\n\n### Immediate Threat and Opportunity Assessment (Head at (3, 5))\n\nThe enemy is looking to move DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT along the top wall. They have apples at (0, 7), (1, 8), (2, 7), (2, 8). They are surrounded by content!\n\n**Let's analyze potential enemy moves from (2, 9):**\n1.  **DOWN to (2, 8):** Eats an apple! (Score 8-7). Puts them one step closer to us, but in column 2.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 9):** Safe. Keeps them horizontal, away from us for now.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** Illegal! They just left (3, 9), but that segment is still part of their body until the tail drops off! **ELIMINATED.** (Wait, the body segments are (3, 9), (4, 9)... Since they didn't eat, their tail (9, 9) will vanish, and (3, 9) *will* become available next turn. BUT since they moved *into* (2, 9), (3, 9) is segment 1. They CANNOT move back to (3, 9)!). **ELIMINATED.**\n\nSo, the enemy will either try to go DOWN to (2, 8) for the apple, or LEFT to (1, 9) to extend along the wall before dropping down. The most likely, high-value move for the enemy is **DOWN to (2, 8)**.\n\n**Our Moves from (3, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Moves us 3 squares closer to the enemy, directly contesting their vertical movement if they try to come down column 3.\n    *   **Risk:** If the enemy goes DOWN to (2, 8) and we go UP to (3, 6), we are still relatively far apart, giving them space. But we are also now closer to the enemy's vertical path.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** **ILLEGAL!** (3, 4) is the segment immediately behind our head. Suicide. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Positions us directly under the enemy's expected drop zone (column 2, likely (2, 8) then (2, 7)). This allows us to start boxing them in against the left wall. Also opens up the apple at (2, 6).\n    *   **Con:** This puts us relatively close to the enemy's body segments if they move to (2, 8) and then (2, 7). We must be ready to react quickly.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Moves us toward the vast open space on the right and apples at (7, 4) or (9, 4). Gives us space to grow and avoid the immediate conflict zone.\n    *   **Con:** Gives up the opportunity to enforce a box-in maneuver against the enemy who is currently pinned on the top wall.\n\n### Strategy: Aggressive Box-In or Pivot to Center Dominance?\n\nThe enemy is currently concentrated on the top left. This is our chance to either seal the deal or use the space they abandoned.\n\nIf we go **UP to (3, 6)**, we are prioritizing column 3. If the enemy drops (e.g., (2, 8) then (2, 7)), we might miss an opportunity to cut them off.\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (2, 5)**, we are now positioned to threaten their next move into (2, 7) or (1, 7). This move also targets the nearby apple at (2, 6) for the following turn. This puts us right in the action.\n\nLet's think about the box. If enemy goes to (2, 8) (eats apple, length 8).\nIf we go to (2, 5) (length 7).\n\n*   Turn 17: Enemy at (2, 8). We are at (2, 5).\n    *   Enemy likely aims for (2, 7) (apple!).\n    *   We can aim for (2, 6) (apple!). This would put us one step behind them in the same column.\n    *   If we go (2, 6) and they go (2, 7), we both eat! Score 8-8 for length 8. They are now above us in the same column. We can then press LEFT or DOWN.\n\nThis maneuver, moving LEFT, is a strategic pivot to the enemy's expected expansion zone. It sets us up for an apple and puts us in a position to challenge the crucial vertical lines (column 1 and 2).\n\nThe alternative, RIGHT to (4, 5), is safe and sets us up to eat later, but it gives the enemy absolutely free rein to take the entire left half of the board. We can't let that happen! We need to disrupt their flow.\n\n**Let's go LEFT! We pressure them and position ourselves for content at (2, 6). We are going for board dominance, not skirting the issue!**\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 17+):\n1.  **Turn 16 (Current):** LEFT to (2, 5). Position for content uptake at (2, 6) and block the enemy's ability to easily pass down column 2 or 1.\n2.  **Turn 17:** If enemy is at (2, 8) or (1, 9), we go UP to (2, 6) for the apple. This forces a vertical engagement where we have the advantage of being lower and more maneuverable. We are committing to the left side push! We must be careful not to trap ourselves between the enemy body and the left wall.\n\nLEFT! Let's get aggressive, Chat! We're putting the clamps on him! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

The enemy is stuck up high, and we are right in the danger zone, ready to pounce!\n\n### Review of Status (Turn 17 / 150)\n\n*   **SCORE:** Enemy 8 apples, We have 6 apples. They pulled ahead slightly, meaning they *did* eat last turn. No biggie, we expected that! Our length is 7, their length is 9 (8 body segments + 1 head, 8 apples means they grew by 2 segments over the starting 7 segments, which means they are length 9. Wait, 8 apples means 8 body segments + 1 head = length 9. They started at length 7. They ate 2 apples total? NO, wait. The problem states \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 6\", \"Snake #0 apples: 8\". If the starting length is usually 3, then we are length 9, they are length 11. Assuming the base length is 3 and they grew from apples, then: Your Length = 3 + 6 = 9. Enemy Length = 3 + 8 = 11. Okay, they are significantly longer! We need to be careful of their long body!)\n\n    *   **Wait, let me re-read the body lists and lengths provided in the input!**\n        *   YOUR SNAKE (ID 1): Head (2, 5). Body: [(3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)]. **Total length: 7.** (Wait, 6 body parts + 1 head = 7. Apples 6. If starting length was 1, then 1+6=7. If starting length was 3, the body list is incomplete. I will trust the explicit body list: **Length 7.**)\n        *   OPPONENT (ID 0): Head (2, 8). Body: [(2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9)]. **Total length: 9.** (8 body parts + 1 head = 9. Apples 8. Again, inconsistent with the 8 apples leading to a length 9 if the starting length was 3, but consistent with the explicit body list supplied by the simulator. **The enemy is 2 segments longer than us!** This requires extra caution!)\n\n*   **Our Head:** (2, 5). We successfully moved LEFT last turn, right into the enemy's expected drop zone.\n*   **Enemy Head:** (2, 8). They moved DOWN and ate an apple at (2, 8)! Smart move, but predictable.\n\n### Enemy Threat Assessment (Head at (2, 8))\n\nThe enemy is now perched in column 2, just 3 squares above us! They are trying to drop down!\n\n**What are the enemy's safe moves from (2, 8)?**\n1.  **DOWN to (2, 7):** Snatches another apple! (A at (2, 7)). High value, high likelihood.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 8):** Excellent apple! (A at (1, 8)). Pushes them against the left wall.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 8):** Another apple! (A at (3, 8)). Pushes them to the middle wall.\n4.  **UP to (2, 9):** **ILLEGAL!** (2, 9) is segment 1 of their body. Suicide. **ELIMINATED.**\n\nThe enemy has three apple options! They are spoiled for choice!\n\n*   If they go DOWN to (2, 7), they are directly engaging us in column 2.\n*   If they go LEFT to (1, 8), they are going for maximum wall coverage and still leave column 2 open for us.\n*   If they go RIGHT to (3, 8), they are clearing out the top row and escaping our pressure in column 2, but expanding their body width.\n\nGiven their previous high-risk move to get the apple at (2, 8), I predict they will continue the chase for content and attempt to go **DOWN to (2, 7)**. This is the most direct vertical threat to us.\n\n### Our Immediate Opportunities (Head at (2, 5))\n\nWe are in a fantastic position, slightly south and west of the action. We have an apple *right next to us* at **(2, 6)**!\n\n**Our Safe Moves from (2, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, moves toward the enemy.\n    *   **Pro:** EATS AN APPLE! Score 7-9. Length 8 vs 9. This is the content we need! We put a snake body segment at (2, 6), which is right on the enemy's vertical path (if they go (2, 7) then (2, 6) next turn).\n    *   **Head-on Collision Risk:** If the enemy goes DOWN to (2, 7) and then we go UP to (2, 6), we are safe this turn. However, if they go DOWN (2, 7) and then plan to go DOWN again, we are positioned to cut them off.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Pro:** Regroups, creates space, moves toward other apples further south at (2, 0) or (0, 4).\n    *   **Con:** Cedes the crucial central-left territory and the apple at (2, 6) to the enemy. We lose pressure.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, moves over an apple! (Apple at (1, 5)).\n    *   **Pro:** EATS AN APPLE! Score 7-9. Length 8 vs 9. Puts us on the left wall, setting up to box them into the corner if they drop down column 2.\n    *   **Con:** Allows the enemy to take the apple right above us at (2, 6) and completely dominate column 2 if they drop to (2, 7).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** **ILLEGAL!** (3, 5) is the segment immediately behind our head. Suicide. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n### Strategic Choice: Box-In or Parallel Grow?\n\nWe have two moves that eat apples: UP to (2, 6) and LEFT to (1, 5).\n\n#### Option A: UP to (2, 6) (Direct Vertical Pressure)\nThis move is AGGRESSIVE. If the enemy moves to (2, 7) (most likely), we will be head-to-head in column 2, with the enemy one spot above us.\n\n*   Enemy at (2, 7). We are at (2, 6).\n*   Next turn: Enemy must turn (LEFT to (1, 7) or RIGHT to (3, 7)) or risk hitting our body if we stay at (2, 6) and they try to move to (2, 6) when we leave it. Wait, if we move UP, our body takes (3, 5). Our tail is now at (2, 2) since we ate and grew. If they move to (2, 6), they crash into our head at (2, 6) if we stayed still. If we move from (2, 6), they can move into (2, 6).\n*   Crucially, if we take (2, 6), we are essentially BLOCKING their easy pathway down. We force them into the corners. We must then avoid them turning into us.\n\n#### Option B: LEFT to (1, 5) (Corner Dominance)\nThis move forces the enemy to decide between dropping into column 2 (towards a head-on engagement) or going further LEFT into the smaller space.\n\n*   Enemy moves to (2, 7). We are at (1, 5). We are safe.\n*   Next turn: We can then look to move UP to (1, 6) or (1, 7) to cut them off, or we can move DOWN to (1, 4). The risk is that the enemy takes (2, 6) right after us, completing their straight drop down column 2 while maintaining board position.\n\n### Decision: Direct Confrontation is the only way to catch up!\n\nGiven the enemy is longer (9 segments) and has the scoreboard advantage (8 vs 6), we must not give them free reign. Taking the apple at (2, 6) is key, as it forces them to either turn or risk a collision, and it helps us close the length gap to 8 vs 9.\n\nIf the enemy goes to (2, 7) and we go to (2, 6), we are perfectly positioned to cut them off next turn by moving LEFT to (1, 6). They would be stuck at (2, 7) with their body segment at (2, 8) and (2, 9), and potentially blocked by us at (2, 6).\n\nIf the enemy decides to go LEFT to (1, 8), and we go UP to (2, 6), our apple move is still a net positive, and we are still positioned strongly in the center-left. We can then press UP to (2, 7) or LEFT to (1, 6).\n\n**We are going UP to challenge their vertical push and assert dominance in column 2!** We need that apple to tie their length deficit!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Turn 18+):\n1.  **Turn 17 (Current):** UP to (2, 6). Eat the apple. (Length 8 vs 9).\n2.  **Turn 18:** If enemy is at (2, 7), we pivot hard LEFT to (1, 6). This effectively blocks them from using the vast open space below their current position, forcing them toward the short left side wall or back to the middle. If they are at (1, 8), we move to (1, 6) for board control. Either way, next move should be LEFT to reinforce the corner box-in. Time to isolate them! \ud83d\ude08\n\nUP",

Let's check the scoreboard and the position!\n\n### Turn 18 Status Check (LIVE!)\n\n*   **SCORE:** Your apples (ID 1): 7. Enemy apples (ID 0): 9. (We closed the gap on the apple count for a net +1 advantage last turn, increasing our length difference from 2 to 1! YES!)\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Length 8. Head now at (2, 6).\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Length 10. Head now at (2, 7). (Wait, they moved DOWN and took the apple at (2, 7)! A clean execution from our rival! They grew too! We are still 2 lengths shorter!)\n    *   *Quick calculation fix:* The score was 6 to 8. We moved to A(2, 6) -> We have 7 total. The opponent moved to A(2, 7) -> They have 9 total. My length is 3+7=10. Their length is 3+9=12. **They are length 12, we are length 10.** Holy smokes, they are LONG! This makes the box-in strategy even more critical.\n\n*   **Tension Point:** We are at (2, 6). The enemy is at (2, 7). We are nose-to-tail, separated by only one square! This is MAXIMUM PRESSURE!\n\n### Enemy Threat Assessment (Head at (2, 7))\n\nThe enemy is sitting just above us. Their body segments block UP and they would hit us if they moved DOWN.\n\n**Enemy Safe Moves from (2, 7):**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (2, 6):** **ILLEGAL!** Our head is at (2, 6)! Head-on collision! **DOUBLE KO!** If they move down, we both die. We are NOT moving down this turn, so if they move down, we both lose. High risk, low likelihood for a rational player when other options exist.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 7):** Safe, open space. Pushes them towards the left wall.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 7):** Safe, open space. Pushes them towards the center.\n4.  **UP to (2, 8):** **ILLEGAL!** (2, 8) is a segment of their very long body (T is at 2, 8)! **SUICIDE!**\n\nThe enemy *must* go LEFT or RIGHT to survive. They are cornered vertically!\n\n### Our Moves and Opportunity Analysis (Head at (2, 6))\n\nThis is the turn to strike, Chat! We are perfectly positioned to cut them off OR force an immediate retreat.\n\n**Our Safe Moves from (2, 6):** (Our body runs [(2, 5), (3, 5)...] so anything not (2, 5) is safe.)\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** HIGH RISK. If the enemy goes LEFT or RIGHT, we move into the spot they just left (2, 7) \u2014 which is safe. However, if the enemy decides to move DOWN (2, 6) to attempt a crash (which we assume they won't), *and we simultaneously move to (2, 7)*, we are both safe, but they leave (2, 6) open for us. Wait, if they move DOWN to (2, 6), they crash into us at (2, 6). **If we move UP to (2, 7), and they move DOWN to (2, 6), we both die in a head-on collision at (2, 6) and (2, 7) simultaneously! NO.**\n    *   *Rethink Head Collision:* If two heads move to the same target square, they both die. If one head moves into a square occupied by another snake's head OR body, the mover dies.\n    *   Currently, we are at (2, 6) and they are at (2, 7).\n        *   If we go UP to (2, 7): We must assume the enemy does NOT go DOWN. If they go DOWN to (2, 6), we die by going into their body at (2, 6) *if* the head move is instantaneous. But simultaneous movement means: If we go (2, 7) and they go (2, 6), we crash head-on at (2, 7) and they crash head-on at (2, 6)? No, the fatal crash happens if HEAD moves into BODY.\n        *   If we move UP to (2, 7), and they move LEFT to (1, 7): Safe. We occupy (2, 7).\n        *   If we move UP to (2, 7), and they move DOWN to (2, 6): This is the critical scenario. We move to (2, 7). They move to (2, 6). We now occupy (2, 7) and they occupy (2, 6). **This is safe!** We took their position and forced them to retreat into our body! (Not quite, they occupied (2, 6) which was where our head was. We leave (2, 6) when we move to (2, 7). They move into (2, 6). Safe.)\n        *   **The REAL risk is head-to-head collision.** We move to (2, 7), they move to (3, 7). They survive. We survive.\n        *   The only deadly scenario is if they move into (2, 6) (our old head location) and we move into (2, 7) (their old head location). This is an exchange, and it's **SAFE**. We take maximum board control!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** **ILLEGAL!** (2, 5) is our body segment 1. Suicide. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, open space.\n    *   **Pro:** This is the ultimate boxing move! If they go RIGHT to (3, 7), we are positioned to come back RIGHT to (2, 6) or (3, 6) next turn, cutting off their return to the left side. If they go LEFT to (1, 7), we are now only one square behind them, ready to cut them off at (1, 7) on Turn 19! This is the most strategically robust move to force them into a smaller area.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, open space.\n    *   **Pro:** Allows us to move towards the center/right side of the map where there are more apples.\n    *   **Con:** Cedes the crucial left wall position. If they go LEFT to (1, 7), they gain a favorable position on the wall and we lose our chance to box them in.\n\n### Strategic Decision: The Trap is Set!\n\nWe have two great options: UP to (2, 7) or LEFT to (1, 6).\n\n*   **UP to (2, 7):** Maximum board pressure. We claim the high ground and force them to turn immediately. However, it still leaves the entire left wall open for them to flank us.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 6):** This solidifies the \"box-in\" strategy planned last turn. If they go LEFT to (1, 7), they are now sandwiched between the wall, their own body, and us (at (1, 6)). If they go RIGHT to (3, 7), we can then follow them toward the center or solidify the trap on the left wall with our long body trailing behind us.\n\nThe risk of going UP to (2, 7) is that it commits us vertically, and if they escape to (1, 7), we have less maneuverability to trap them. Going LEFT to (1, 6) maintains the best flank position to convert this vertical engagement into a box-in.\n\nWe need to use our body length (10 segments) to our advantage and close spaces. The enemy is long (12 segments), so trapping them is the goal. (1, 6) is the perfect spot to start building the wall and forcing them off the main grid. Look at the board: if we are at (1, 6) and they are at (1, 7) next turn, they only have LEFT (W), UP (W), and DOWN (1, 6) which is blocked by our head or body! YES!\n\n**Prediction:** The enemy will move LEFT to (1, 7) because it leads to an apple at (1, 8) in the following turn and provides wall safety.\n\n**Our Move: LEFT to (1, 6).** Full commitment to the Box-in! Let's go, Chat! We are forcing their hand!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Turn 19+):\n1.  **Turn 18 (Current):** LEFT to (1, 6).\n2.  **Turn 19:** If enemy is at (1, 7) (most likely), we move UP to (1, 7) for the head-on kill (if they are still there!), or RIGHT to (2, 6) to loop our body if they moved away from the wall. We want to seal off the bottom-left corner and force them to tangle.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake (#1) prowls left side with head at **(2,\u202f6)** and a tight \u201cU\u201d below it.  \n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE TASTERS** \u2013 We see apples at **(1,8)**, **(0,7)**, **(3,8)**, **(9,6)**, etc. None sit directly under me now, but the apple at **(0,7)** is *one step away* if I shimmy left.  \n\n\ud83e\udded **MOVE OPTIONS BREAKDOWN**  \n\n| Direction | Immediate Apple? | Body Collide? | Opponent Collide? | Future Mobility |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **UP**    | \u274c (off\u2011board / own body) | \u2705 (hits (2,9)) | \u2705 (blocked) | NO |\n| **RIGHT** | \u274c (no apple) | \u2705 (blocks (2,9) \u2192 own body) | \u2705 (blocked) | Only \u2193 & \u2192 \u2013 squeezes me into a corner |\n| **LEFT**  | \u274c (no apple) | \u2705 (no body at (1,7)) | \u2705 (none) | **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT** \u2013 three escape lanes |\n| **DOWN**  | \u274c (opponent head) | \u2705 (hits (2,6)) | \u2705 (direct head\u2011on) | DEAD (immediate loss) |\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **WHY LEFT IS THE KILLER**  \n\n- **Safe**: (1,7) is completely empty \u2013 no body, no apple, no board edge.  \n- **Future\u2011Proof**: After LEFT I keep three legal directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT). That\u2019s the highest flexibility; RIGHT would lock me into a corner.  \n- **Trap Blueprint**:  \n  1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f18:** **LEFT** \u2192 (1,7). The cell I leave behind (2,7) becomes a body segment, *blocking* Snake\u202f#1\u2019s upward escape.  \n  2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f19:** If #1 foolishly climbs up (to (2,7)), they smash into my new body \u2192 *they die* while I stay alive and grab the apple at **(1,8)** (or at **(0,7)** on the next move).  \n  3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f20\u201121:** After the kill, I slam left again to **(0,7)** (apple +1), then keep crawling left toward the leftmost wall, cementing a vertical wall on column\u202f0. The enemy can\u2019t cross column\u202f0 \u2013 they\u2019re forced to wander the right side, where I\u2019ll expand horizontally and crush them.  \n- **Apple Rush**: Moving LEFT puts me on the path to the apple at (0,7) *two steps away* and the apple at (1,8) *one step up*. That gives me an extra growth point **before** I even consider the opponent\u2019s death, widening the gap (9\u202f\u2192\u202f10).  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Score Leverage** \u2013 I\u2019m already ahead 9\u20117. A clean kill pushes the lead to 10\u20117, making it impossible for them to catch up before I hit the 30\u2011apple threshold.  \n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **LONG\u2011TERM PLAN (for my future self)**  \n- **Turn\u202f18:** LEFT \u2192 (1,7).  \n- **Turn\u202f19:** UP (if opponent still lives) to grab the apple at (1,8) and stay ahead.  \n- **Turn\u202f20\u201123:** Keep moving left, collecting apples at (0,7), (0,6)\u2026 (0,4) and turning the left edge into a *vertical fortress*.  \n- **Turn\u202f24\u201130:** After my wall is solid, swing right across the top row, using my long body to *squeeze* Snake\u202f#1 into a dead\u2011end at column\u202f2. When they try to squeeze through (2,7) they\u2019ll slam into my body \u2192 *instant KO*.  \n- **Turn\u202f30+:** If they survive my wall, I\u2019ll chase the remaining apples at (3,8), (6,8), (9,4), (9,6) \u2013 *pacing out* points while keeping the board locked down.  \n\n\u2728 **Bottom line** \u2013 LEFT keeps my mobility maxed, builds the perfect vertical barricade, and hands me two apple\u2011eating lanes (up & left) while isolating the enemy into a narrow corridor where they\u2019ll inevitably ram into my body. Aggression + safety = dominance.  \n\n**PLAN NOTE** \u2013 *Keep the column\u20111 barrier alive, then march left to the edge. Once column\u202f0 is fortified, swing right across the top row and force a head\u2011on crash.*  \n\nLEFT",

Let's check the clip!\n\n### Turn 19 Status Check (LIVE!)\n\n*   **SCORE:** Your apples (ID 1): 7. Enemy apples (ID 0): 9. Still behind, but we are closing the space gap!\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head is now at (1, 6). Length 8. Body is [(2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2)].\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head is now at (1, 7). Length 10. Body is [(2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)].\n\n**YES! THE TRAP WORKED!**\n\nWe moved LEFT to (1, 6). The enemy moved LEFT to (1, 7). We are now positioned perfectly to *cut him completely off* from the bottom half of the board! Maximum pressure, maximum content!\n\n### Enemy Threat Assessment (Head at (1, 7))\n\nThe enemy is currently at (1, 7). They are backed against the left wall (x=0) and the top of our imposing body!\n\n**Enemy Safe Moves from (1, 7):**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (1, 6):** **FATALITY!** Our head is at (1, 6)! This is a guaranteed head-on collision, where *both* snakes die, as we move simultaneously. Since they have 9 apples and we have 7, they would win the tiebreaker if we both move into each other's head spaces. **Wait, NO.** If they move DOWN to (1, 6), and we move simultaneously into *their* space (say, UP to (1, 7)), then we exchange spaces and it's safe! But if we *stay* or move in a direction that leaves (1, 6) open, and they move into (1, 6), they crash into our body segment (2, 6) *if* we don't move. But since we are moving, the body shifts. **The safest assumption is: If they move DOWN to (1, 6), and we move UP to (1, 7), it's a safe exchange!**\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 7):** Safe, and immediately scores an apple at A(0, 7)! This is highly likely.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):** **ILLEGAL!** (2, 7) is their body segment! Suicide for them! **ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **UP to (1, 8):** Safe, and immediately scores an apple at A(1, 8)! Also highly likely.\n\nThe enemy MUST go LEFT or UP to grab an apple and survive in open space. Moving DOWN to (1, 6) is too risky unless they are SURE we aren't there\u2014and since we just positioned ourselves there, they should be hyper-aware.\n\n### Our Moves and Opportunity Analysis (Head at (1, 6))\n\nChat, if they move UP or LEFT, we have the ultimate counter-punch to start sealing this corner!\n\n**Our Safe Moves from (1, 6):** (Our body runs [(2, 6), (2, 5)...]. (2, 6) is directly to our RIGHT.)\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** HIGH RISK/HIGH REWARD.\n    *   **If Enemy goes LEFT (0, 7) or UP (1, 8):** We move into (1, 7), claiming the critical exit point. The enemy is now stuck on the top edge and must traverse the long way around their own body. This is the **KILLER MOVE** for board domination.\n    *   **If Enemy goes DOWN (1, 6):** Head-on collision at (1, 7) and (1, 6) simultaneously. **CRASH!** Both snakes die. Since the enemy has 9 apples and we have 7, they win the tiebreaker. We cannot risk this! **Unless we are 100% sure they WON'T go DOWN**, we must avoid this for now. They have apples to eat, so they are unlikely to commit suicide yet.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, open space.\n    *   **Pro:** Retreats us toward the apple at (1, 5).\n    *   **Con:** Cedes the tactical high ground at (1, 6) and allows the enemy to potentially circle back or move DOWN to (1, 6) next turn, escaping the trap we just set. **BAD MOVE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, open space (wall crash risk in the future, but currently safe).\n    *   **Pro:** Gets us to the wall (x=0). If the enemy goes LEFT to (0, 7), we continue walling them off. This sets up a perfect two-turn clamp.\n    *   **Con:** Doesn't directly block (1, 7). If they go UP to (1, 8), we lose the positional advantage.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** **ILLEGAL!** (2, 6) is our immediate body segment. Suicide. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n### The Strategic Decision: Tightening the Noose\n\nWe are committed to boxing Snake #0 into the top-left corner. We need to claim (1, 7) while avoiding a mutual KO.\n\nSince the enemy has safe apple options UP to (1, 8) and LEFT to (0, 7), the chance they move DOWN to initiate a kill (and a draw they win) is low. They want to live and extend their lead.\n\nTherefore, the most aggressive, decisive, and board-winning move is **UP to (1, 7)**. This takes the space they just exited.\n\n**If they move LEFT to (0, 7) (Apple):** We are at (1, 7). They are trapped between their own body and the wall. Next turn, we can move LEFT to (0, 7) and complete the enclosure (or force them to choose between their body segment (2, 7) or suicide).\n*   *Wait, if they move LEFT to (0, 7), they eat the apple and grow. Their head is (0, 7), body starts (1, 7). Since we move to (1, 7), we crash into their body?* **NO!** Since they just left (1, 7) and moved to (0, 7), (1, 7) *becomes the new body segment*. **IF we move UP to (1, 7), we crash into the new *head-segment-turned-body-segment* at (1, 7)!**\n\n#### RETHINK: The Simultaneous Body Growth Crash!!\n\nWhen a snake eats an apple and grows, the cell they just left *becomes a new body segment*.\n*   Enemy Head: (1, 7).\n*   If Enemy moves LEFT to (0, 7) (APPLE) **This Turn**:\n    *   New Head: (0, 7)\n    *   New Body Segment 1: (1, 7)\n    *   Old Body: [(2, 7), (2, 8), ...]\n    *   Total length increases.\n*   **If we move UP to (1, 7) simultaneously:** We move our head straight into their **NEW BODY SEGMENT** at (1, 7)! **WE DIE!**\n\nThis is the ultimate trap counter! We cannot afford to move into a space the opponent might have just created a body segment in by eating an apple!\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving UP to (1, 7) is only safe if they move UP to (1, 8). If they move LEFT to (0, 7), we crash and burn. Since there is a 50% chance they go left for the apple, we can't risk **UP**.\n\nThis refocuses us on **LEFT to (0, 6)**. It's safer and still seals the wall.\n\n**If we move LEFT to (0, 6):**\n*   **If Enemy moves LEFT to (0, 7) (Apple):** They are at (0, 7). We are at (0, 6). They are pinned on the wall. We maintain control. Next turn, we must decide if we move UP to (0, 7) (potential crash) or RIGHT (to (1, 6)) to secure the trap line.\n*   **If Enemy moves UP to (1, 8) (Apple):** They are at (1, 8). We are at (0, 6). They are still trapped against the top edge. We can solidify our wall by moving UP to (0, 7) next turn.\n\n(0, 6) is the **safe and strategically sound move** that continues the boxing strategy without risking a body collision from the enemy eating an apple. We move to the x=0 wall, creating the corner edge of our wall of incarceration.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Turn 20+):\n1.  **Turn 19 (Current):** LEFT to (0, 6). Establish the bottom-left corner of the trap cage.\n2.  **Turn 20:** Wait for enemy movement. If they are at (0, 7), we move RIGHT to (1, 6) to hold the line and force them up. If they are at (1, 8), we move UP to (0, 7) to claim the apple and keep the vertical pressure on the wall. The goal is to keep them restricted to x=0/x=1 or force them into their long body above y=7.\n\nLEFT",

The next time they try to sneak left, they\u2019ll hit my fresh wall and die.  \n- **Aggressive Traps:** If snake #1 foolishly climbs up to (1,\u202f7) after I go left, that cell becomes my body \u2013 **instant kill** for them. Even if they go left (to (0,\u202f6)), I\u2019ll later swing down onto that spot when the coast is clear, crushing them like a soda can.  \n- **Score Leverage:** I\u2019m already ahead 9\u20117. Turning that into 10\u20117 makes it mathematically impossible for the enemy to catch up before I hit the 30\u2011apple threshold.

No, the only crash risk is if they move DOWN to (0, 6).\n    *   **IF they move UP to (0, 8) (as predicted):** We move into (0, 7), claiming the corner and sealing the fate of the enemy. They are trapped against the wall (x=0) and our body line (y=6). This forces them into a small space. **This is the KILLER MOVE!**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, open space.\n    *   **Pro:** Retreats us to open space.\n    *   **Con:** Cedes (0, 7) to the opponent if they decide to move UP to (0, 8). This releases the pressure completely, allowing them to extend their body length along the x=0 wall at their leisure. **BAD MOVE, we are hunting!**\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** **ILLEGAL!** (1, 6) is our immediate body segment. Suicide. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n### The Strategic Decision: Finishing the Box\n\nThe opponent's only guaranteed safe move is UP to (0, 8). If they choose to move DOWN to (0, 6), it results in a simultaneous head-on collision, which they lose the tiebreaker on (10 vs 7 apples), *unless* the rules state that simultaneous head collisions are just losses for both, regardless of score. Since the rules say: \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins,\" a simultaneous KO means they *still* win the game if we both crash.\n\n**However, they are losing ground rapidly.** Moving DOWN is a guaranteed game-ender for them (a draw victory is still a win). Why would they choose to sacrifice their 10 apples when a safe, high-ground path exists at (0, 8)? They won't.\n\n**We must assume they move UP to (0, 8).**\n\nIf they move UP to (0, 8), we must move **UP to (0, 7)**.\n\n**Why UP is the ultimate play:**\n\n*   It claims the highest vertical wall segment, completing the x=0 wall trap.\n*   It forces the enemy further into the top-most corner, where they must decide whether to move RIGHT across the body line at y=8, or simply snake back and forth between (0, 8) and (0, 9), slowly running out of options.\n*   The enemy's long body is now their *own* worst enemy! They have nowhere to go but to follow their own tail.\n\nIf we move UP, we are securing the kill area! This is high-risk, high-reward content, Chat! We are counting on their instinct to survive.\n\n**Move: UP!**\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Turn 21+):\n1.  **Turn 20 (Current):** UP to (0, 7). Claim the corner space. Enemy is forced UP to (0, 8).\n2.  **Turn 21:** Our head is at (0, 7). Enemy head is at (0, 8). We move **RIGHT to (1, 7)**. This forces the enemy to move UP again (to (0, 9)) or RIGHT (to (1, 8), which is now open). If they move RIGHT to (1, 8), they are between their body line [(2, 8), (2, 9)...] and our body line [(1, 6), (2, 6)...].\n3.  **Turn 22:** We continue to hold the line at y=7 (along (1, 7), (2, 7) if possible) and squeeze them down, forcing them to crash into their own body or ours. Pressure, pressure, pressure!\n\nUP",
