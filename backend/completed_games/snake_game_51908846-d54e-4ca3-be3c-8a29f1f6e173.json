I can grab it immediately and then work my way down toward the cluster of apples at (5, 5) and (4, 5).\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nAfter collecting (5, 9), I should head DOWN toward the (5, 5) and (4, 5) apple cluster. The enemy snake at (0, 3) will likely go for the (1, 4) and (2, 4) apples since they're closer to it. I should focus on the apples on my side of the board first.\n\nUP",

UP: Would go to (5, 10) - This is outside the board (y=10 is beyond 0-9 range). DEATH!\n\n2. DOWN: Would go to (5, 8) - This is where my tail currently is. Wait, let me think about this more carefully. My body is [(5, 8)], meaning my tail is at (5, 8). When I move, my tail will move too (since I didn't just eat an apple this turn... wait, I did eat an apple last turn at (5, 9)). \n\nActually, looking at the board state, I have a body segment at (5, 8) marked as \"T\" (tail). Since I just ate an apple last turn, my snake grew. So my current body is head at (5, 9) and tail at (5, 8).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 8), that's where my tail currently is. But since I ate an apple last turn, my tail won't move this turn - it stays in place as the snake grows. So moving DOWN would put my head into my own body. DEATH!\n\n3. LEFT: Would go to (4, 9) - This is safe, no obstacles. Let me check for any snake bodies or walls.\n   - Within board bounds: Yes\n   - Not hitting my body: My body is at (5, 8), so (4, 9) is safe\n   - Not hitting enemy: Enemy is at (0, 2), nowhere near\n\n4. RIGHT: Would go to (6, 9) - This is safe, no obstacles.\n   - Within board bounds: Yes\n   - Not hitting my body: Safe\n   - Not hitting enemy: Safe\n\nSo my only safe moves are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nNow let me think strategically about which is better:\n\nApples at: (2, 4), (5, 5), (1, 4), (4, 5), (6, 3)\n\nFrom (4, 9) [if I go LEFT]:\n- (5, 5) is 1 right, 4 down = 5 moves\n- (4, 5) is 0 right, 4 down = 4 moves - closest!\n- (2, 4) is 2 left, 5 down = 7 moves\n- (1, 4) is 3 left, 5 down = 8 moves\n- (6, 3) is 2 right, 6 down = 8 moves\n\nFrom (6, 9) [if I go RIGHT]:\n- (5, 5) is 1 left, 4 down = 5 moves\n- (4, 5) is 2 left, 4 down = 6 moves\n- (6, 3) is 0 left, 6 down = 6 moves\n- (2, 4) is 4 left, 5 down = 9 moves\n- (1, 4) is 5 left, 5 down = 10 moves\n\nGoing LEFT puts me closer to the apple cluster at (4, 5) and (5, 5). Going RIGHT puts me closer to (6, 3) but further from the main cluster.\n\nThe enemy snake at (0, 2) is closest to apples at (1, 4) and (2, 4). It will likely go for those.\n\nI should go LEFT to head toward the (4, 5) and (5, 5) cluster which I can reach without much competition from the enemy.\n\nWait, let me double-check the body situation. The board shows:\n- 9: \"1\" at position 5 (my head)\n- 8: \"T\" at position 5 (my tail)\n\nSo my snake is head at (5, 9), body/tail at (5, 8). I ate an apple last turn, so my body grew. When I move this turn, since I just ate, my tail won't retract - it stays. So:\n- Moving DOWN to (5, 8) would hit my own tail = DEATH\n- Moving UP to (5, 10) would be off the board = DEATH\n\nLEFT and RIGHT are my only options.\n\nStrategy for next few turns:\n1. Go LEFT to (4, 9)\n2. Then head DOWN toward (4, 5) apple\n3. After that, go for (5, 5)\n4. Keep avoiding the enemy snake\n\nLEFT seems like the better choice to position myself for the apple cluster.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- My head is at (5, 9), body/tail at (5, 8)\n- I just ate an apple last turn, so my tail won't move this turn\n\nLet me evaluate my options:\n\n**UP: (5, 10)** - OFF THE BOARD! Death.\n\n**DOWN: (5, 8)** - This is where my tail currently is. Since I just ate an apple, my body grew and the tail stays in place. Moving here would hit my own body. Death.\n\n**LEFT: (4, 9)** - Safe! Within bounds, no obstacles.\n\n**RIGHT: (6, 9)** - Safe! Within bounds, no obstacles.\n\nSo I only have two safe moves: LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\n- Apples: (2, 4), (5, 5), (1, 4), (4, 5), (6, 3)\n- Going LEFT toward (4, 9) positions me closer to the apple cluster at (4, 5) and (5, 5)\n- Going RIGHT toward (6, 9) positions me toward (6, 3) but further from the main cluster\n- Enemy snake at (0, 2) will likely target (1, 4) and (2, 4) since they're closest to it\n\nI should go LEFT to efficiently reach the (4, 5) and (5, 5) apples before considering other targets.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. Move LEFT now to (4, 9)\n2. Head DOWN toward (4, 5) - roughly 4 moves\n3. Then target (5, 5)\n4. Avoid enemy snake's territory near (1, 4) and (2, 4)\n\nLEFT",

UP: Would go to (4, 10) - This is outside the board (y=10 is beyond 0-9 range). DEATH!\n\n2. DOWN: Would go to (4, 8) - This is safe, within bounds, no snake bodies here.\n\n3. LEFT: Would go to (3, 9) - This is safe, within bounds, no snake bodies here.\n\n4. RIGHT: Would go to (5, 9) - This is where my tail currently is. Since I didn't eat an apple last turn (I moved to (4, 9) from (5, 9) and there was no apple there), my tail will move when I move. Let me think... \n\nWait, I need to reconsider. Looking at the last move information, I moved LEFT from (5, 9) to (4, 9). The previous turn I had collected an apple (total 1 apple). So let me think about where the tail is after the snake moves.\n\nActually, looking at the board, my snake is:\n- Head at (4, 9) shown as \"1\"\n- Tail at (5, 9) shown as \"T\"\n\nThe snake has 1 apple collected, so the body length is 2 (head + 1 body segment from the apple).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 9), that's where my tail currently is. But when I move, my tail will also move (unless I just ate an apple, but I didn't eat one last turn - I just moved LEFT). So the tail at (5, 9) will move forward (toward where the head was before), meaning (5, 9) would be vacated.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The snake moves like this:\n- The head moves to a new position\n- Each body segment moves to where the segment in front of it was\n- The tail disappears (unless you just ate an apple)\n\nSo if my head is at (4, 9) and tail at (5, 9), when I move:\n- If I move RIGHT to (5, 9), my head would go to (5, 9)\n- My tail at (5, 9) would move to (4, 9) (where the head was)\n\nBut wait, the movement happens simultaneously. So at the moment of the move:\n- My head tries to go to (5, 9)\n- At the same moment, my tail at (5, 9) would move to follow\n\nThe question is: does my head collide with my tail before the tail moves? \n\nIn standard snake games, the tail moves out of the way before the head arrives, so moving into where your tail currently is should be safe (if you didn't just eat an apple).\n\nBut wait, I collected 1 apple previously. Let me re-read... \"Your snake (ID: 1): Apples collected: 1\"\n\nLooking at my last move info: I moved LEFT. Before that, my head was at (5, 9) and body at (5, 8). After moving LEFT, my head is now at (4, 9).\n\nIf I didn't eat an apple on turn 2, then my body should have moved too. The body was at (5, 8), and now it should have followed the head. So the body (now tail) should be at (5, 9) - where the head was.\n\nSo this means on turn 2 I didn't eat an apple (there's no apple at (4, 9)). So if I move now on turn 3:\n- My head moves from (4, 9)\n- My tail at (5, 9) will move to (4, 9) (where head was)\n- The cell at (5, 9) will be vacated\n\nSo if I go RIGHT to (5, 9), my head goes there while my tail leaves. This should be safe.\n\nBut let me be careful. The rules say:\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\nThe question is timing. I think the safest assumption is that the collision check happens before the tail moves. So moving RIGHT into (5, 9) might be risky.\n\nLet me just avoid that possibility and go with clearly safe moves:\n- DOWN to (4, 8): Safe\n- LEFT to (3, 9): Safe\n\nNow strategically, which is better?\n\nApples at: (2, 4), (5, 5), (1, 4), (4, 5), (6, 3)\n\nFrom (4, 8) [if I go DOWN]:\n- (4, 5) is 3 down = 3 moves - very close!\n- (5, 5) is 1 right, 3 down = 4 moves\n- (2, 4) is 2 left, 4 down = 6 moves\n- (1, 4) is 3 left, 4 down = 7 moves\n- (6, 3) is 2 right, 5 down = 7 moves\n\nFrom (3, 9) [if I go LEFT]:\n- (4, 5) is 1 right, 4 down = 5 moves\n- (5, 5) is 2 right, 4 down = 6 moves\n- (2, 4) is 1 left, 5 down = 6 moves\n- (1, 4) is 2 left, 5 down = 7 moves\n- (6, 3) is 3 right, 6 down = 9 moves\n\nGoing DOWN puts me closer to (4, 5) - only 3 moves away! That's a clear advantage.\n\nThe enemy snake at (0, 1) is quite far. It's closest to (1, 4) and (2, 4).\n\nPlan:\n1. Go DOWN now to (4, 8)\n2. Continue DOWN to (4, 7)\n3. Continue DOWN to (4, 6)\n4. Continue DOWN to (4, 5) - eat the apple!\n5. Then go for (5, 5)\n\nThis is a solid path to collect apples efficiently.\n\nDOWN\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- My head is at (4, 9), tail at (5, 9)\n- I didn't eat an apple last turn (just moved LEFT)\n\nLet me evaluate my options from (4, 9):\n\n**UP: (4, 10)** - OFF THE BOARD! Death.\n\n**DOWN: (4, 8)** - Safe! Clear cell, within bounds.\n\n**LEFT: (3, 9)** - Safe! Clear cell, within bounds.\n\n**RIGHT: (5, 9)** - This is where my tail currently is. While the tail should move when I move, I'll avoid this potential risk.\n\nSo my clearly safe moves are DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\n- Apples: (2, 4), (5, 5), (1, 4), (4, 5), (6, 3)\n- From (4, 8) if I go DOWN: The apple at (4, 5) is directly below - only 3 moves away!\n- From (3, 9) if I go LEFT: The apple at (4, 5) would be 5 moves away\n\nGoing DOWN gives me a direct path to (4, 5), which is the most efficient route to an apple.\n\nEnemy snake at (0, 1) will likely target (1, 4) and (2, 4) - they're on the other side of the board, so no collision risk.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. DOWN now to (4, 8)\n2. DOWN to (4, 7)\n3. DOWN to (4, 6)\n4. DOWN to (4, 5) - collect apple!\n5. Then RIGHT to (5, 5) for the next apple\n\nDOWN",

Since I didn't eat an apple last turn, my tail should move when I move, so this cell would be vacated. But to be safe, I'll avoid this since it's moving backward into my own body which could be risky.\n\n2. **DOWN: (4, 7)** - This is safe, within bounds, no snake bodies here.\n\n3. **LEFT: (3, 8)** - This is safe, within bounds, no snake bodies here.\n\n4. **RIGHT: (5, 8)** - This is safe, within bounds, no snake bodies here.\n\nWait, moving UP to (4, 9) is moving directly backwards into my own body (the cell directly behind my head). The rules say \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n\nSo UP is definitely DEATH!\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n\nNow strategically, which is better?\n\nFollowing my plan from last turn:\n1.

DOWN leads to (4, 5) in 2 moves, RIGHT leads to (5, 5) in 3 moves.\n\nLet me stick with my plan and go DOWN to stay on track for (4, 5).\n\nThe enemy snake at (0, 2) is far away and likely heading toward (1, 4) and (2, 4). No collision risk for now.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. DOWN now to (4, 7)\n2. DOWN to (4, 6)\n3. DOWN to (4, 5) - collect apple!\n4. Then RIGHT to (5, 5) for the next apple\n\nDOWN\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- My head is at (4, 8), tail at (4, 9)\n- Turn 3 of 150\n\nLet me evaluate my options from (4, 8):\n\n**UP: (4, 9)** - This is moving directly backwards into my own tail/body.

Moving into my own body = DEATH!\n\n4. **RIGHT: (6, 5)** - Safe, empty cell.\n\nSo LEFT is DEATH (moving into my body).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\nNow let me think about which move is best strategically:\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 3):\n- From (5, 5), I need to go 1 right and 2 down to reach (6, 3)\n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 5), I'll be positioned to go DOWN, DOWN to (6, 3)\n- If I go DOWN to (5, 4), I need to go DOWN again to (5, 3), then RIGHT to (6, 3)\n\nBoth paths are similar length.\n\nOther apples:\n- (2, 4) and (1, 4) are on the left side, and the enemy snake at (2, 2) is likely heading that direction\n- (9, 9) is far in the top-right corner\n- (9, 0) is far in the bottom-right corner\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2, 2). If it moves UP it would be at (2, 3). If it moves UP again, it could reach (2, 4) in 2 turns.\n\nMy plan from last turn was to go toward (6, 3):\n1. RIGHT to (6, 5)\n2. DOWN to (6, 4)\n3. DOWN to (6, 3) - collect apple!\n\nThis seems like a good plan. Let me check if there are any risks:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 5):\n- My body will be at (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)\n- Next turn I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (not LEFT into my body)\n- This is good - multiple safe options\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 4):\n- My body will be at (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)\n- Next turn I can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (not UP into my body)\n- This is also good\n\nIf I go UP to (5, 6):\n- My body will be at (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)\n- Next turn I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (not DOWN into my body)\n- This moves me away from the nearest apple at (6, 3)\n\nI think going DOWN is slightly better than RIGHT because:\n- It gets me closer to (6, 3) in terms of y-coordinate\n- From (5, 4), I can go RIGHT to (6, 4), then DOWN to (6, 3)\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The path via RIGHT:\n- Turn 7: (5,5) \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 (6,5)\n- Turn 8: (6,5) \u2192 DOWN \u2192 (6,4)\n- Turn 9: (6,4) \u2192 DOWN \u2192 (6,3) \u2190 apple!\n\nThe path via DOWN:\n- Turn 7: (5,5) \u2192 DOWN \u2192 (5,4)\n- Turn 8: (5,4) \u2192 DOWN \u2192 (5,3)\n- Turn 9: (5,3) \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 (6,3) \u2190 apple!\n\nBoth paths are 3 turns to the apple. Let me think about which gives better positioning...\n\nGoing DOWN first keeps me more central, which could be useful. Going RIGHT first puts me in a column closer to the right-side apples.\n\nHmm, I think either is fine. Let me go with DOWN since it keeps me more central and flexible.\n\nWait, let me check for any head-on collision risks:\n\nEnemy snake head at (2, 2). Possible moves for enemy:\n- UP to (2, 3)\n- DOWN to (2, 1)\n- LEFT to (1, 2)\n- RIGHT to (3, 2)\n\nNone of these are near (5, 4), (5, 6), or (6, 5), so I don't need to worry about head-on collision this turn.\n\nI'll go with DOWN to (5, 4), heading toward the apple at (6, 3).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. DOWN now to (5, 4) (this move)\n2. DOWN to (5, 3)\n3. RIGHT to (6, 3) - collect apple!\n4. Then consider going toward (9, 0) or (9, 9)\n\nActually wait - let me reconsider. If I go DOWN to (5, 4), then my body will be at (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6). On the next turn from (5, 4), if I want to go LEFT, I would go to (4, 4) which is safe. If I go DOWN, I go to (5, 3). If I go RIGHT, I go to (6, 4). If I go UP, I go to (5, 5) which is my body - DEATH.\n\nSo from (5, 4), my safe moves would be LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. That's 3 options, which is good.\n\nLet me also check from (6, 5) if I went RIGHT:\n- My body would be at (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)\n- From (6, 5): UP to (6, 6), DOWN to (6, 4), LEFT to (5, 5) - my body - DEATH, RIGHT to (7, 5)\n- Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT - also 3 options\n\nBoth seem equally good in terms of keeping options open. I'll stick with DOWN since it's more central.\n\nDOWN\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- My head is at (5, 5), body at (4, 5), (4, 6), and tail at (4, 7)\n- Turn 7 of 150\n- I'm ahead 3-0 in apples\n\nLet me evaluate my options from (5, 5):\n\n**UP: (5, 6)** - Safe, empty cell.\n\n**DOWN: (5, 4)** - Safe, empty cell.\n\n**LEFT: (4, 5)** - This is my body! Moving into my own body = DEATH!\n\n**RIGHT: (6, 5)** - Safe, empty cell.\n\nSafe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nThe nearest apple is at (6, 3), which is 1 right and 2 down from my current position. I should head toward it.\n\nEnemy snake at (2, 2) is likely heading toward the apples at (1, 4) or (2, 4) on the left side. No collision risk with me this turn.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are good choices to approach (6, 3):\n- DOWN path: (5, 4) \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 (6, 3) - 3 turns\n- RIGHT path: (6, 5) \u2192 (6, 4) \u2192 (6, 3) - 3 turns\n\nI'll go DOWN to stay more central and flexible on the board.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. DOWN now to (5, 4) (this move)\n2. DOWN to (5, 3)\n3. RIGHT to (6, 3) - collect apple!\n4. Then consider the corner apples at (9, 0) or (9, 9)\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT to (6, 3) - collect apple!\n\nSo I should continue with DOWN to (5, 3).\n\nBut let me also consider other options:\n\nLEFT to (4, 4):\n- This moves me toward apples at (2, 4) and (1, 4)\n- But enemy snake at (3, 2) might be heading there too\n- From (4, 4), I could go LEFT to (3, 4), then LEFT to (2, 4)\n\nRIGHT to (6, 4):\n- This moves me toward the apple at (6, 3)\n- From (6, 4), I can go DOWN to (6, 3) and collect the apple!\n- This is actually one turn faster than my original plan!\n\nDOWN to (5, 3):\n- This continues my original plan\n- From (5, 3), I go RIGHT to (6, 3) and collect the apple\n\nActually, RIGHT is the fastest path to the apple at (6, 3):\n- Turn 8: (5, 4) \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 (6, 4)\n- Turn 9: (6, 4) \u2192 DOWN \u2192 (6, 3) - apple!\n\nOriginal DOWN plan:\n- Turn 8: (5, 4) \u2192 DOWN \u2192 (5, 3)\n- Turn 9: (5, 3) \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 (6, 3) - apple!\n\nBoth are 2 turns to the apple. So they're equally good in that regard.\n\nLet me check the enemy snake:\n- Enemy head at (3, 2)\n- It could move UP to (3, 3), DOWN to (3, 1), LEFT to (2, 2), or RIGHT to (4, 2)\n\nIf the enemy goes for (2, 4) or (1, 4):\n- UP to (3, 3), then UP to (3, 4), then LEFT to (2, 4) - 3 turns\n- The enemy is closer to those apples than I am\n\nSo I should focus on (6, 3) rather than competing for (2, 4) and (1, 4).\n\nLet me check for head-on collision risks:\n- If I go DOWN to (5, 3), enemy could only reach (5, 3) if it went RIGHT, RIGHT. From (3, 2), going RIGHT twice would be (5, 2), not (5, 3). So no risk.\n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 4), enemy could only reach (6, 4) if it went RIGHT, RIGHT, UP. From (3, 2), that would be (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3). Not (6, 4). So no risk.\n- If I go LEFT to (4, 4), enemy could reach (4, 4) if it went RIGHT, UP, UP. From (3, 2), that would be (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4). But that's 3 moves, and I'm only moving 1 move. So no immediate risk this turn.\n\nAll three safe moves don't have head-on collision risks this turn.\n\nLet me think about positioning after each move:\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 3):\n- My body will be at (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5)\n- From (5, 3), I can go: UP to (5, 4) - my body - DEATH, DOWN to (5, 2), LEFT to (4, 3), RIGHT to (6, 3) - apple!\n- Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT - 3 options\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 4):\n- My body will be at (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5)\n- From (6, 4), I can go: UP to (6, 5), DOWN to (6, 3) - apple!, LEFT to (5, 4) - my body - DEATH, RIGHT to (7, 4)\n- Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT - 3 options\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 4):\n- My body will be at (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5)\n- From (4, 4), I can go: UP to (4, 5) - my body - DEATH, DOWN to (4, 3), LEFT to (3, 4), RIGHT to (5, 4) - my body - DEATH\n- Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT - only 2 options!\n\nSo LEFT is worse because it limits my options to only 2 safe moves next turn.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT, both give 3 safe options next turn and both lead to the apple at (6, 3) in 2 turns.\n\nI'll go with DOWN to stick with my original plan and stay more central.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. If I go RIGHT to (6, 4):\n- My body will be at (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5)\n- Wait, my tail is at (4, 6). So my body is (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6).\n- After I move RIGHT to (6, 4), my body becomes (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5). The tail at (4, 6) disappears (unless I eat an apple).\n\nLet me recalculate for DOWN to (5, 3):\n- Current: head at (5, 4), body at (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)\n- After DOWN to (5, 3): head at (5, 3), body at (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5). Tail at (4, 6) disappears.\n- From (5, 3), checking moves:\n  - UP to (5, 4) - my body - DEATH\n  - DOWN to (5, 2) - safe\n  - LEFT to (4, 3) - safe\n  - RIGHT to (6, 3) - apple! safe\n\nAnd for RIGHT to (6, 4):\n- Current: head at (5, 4), body at (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)\n- After RIGHT to (6, 4): head at (6, 4), body at (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5). Tail at (4, 6) disappears.\n- From (6, 4), checking moves:\n  - UP to (6, 5) - safe\n  - DOWN to (6, 3) - apple! safe\n  - LEFT to (5, 4) - my body - DEATH\n  - RIGHT to (7, 4) - safe\n\nBoth options give 3 safe moves next turn and lead to the apple at (6, 3) in one more turn.\n\nI think I'll stick with DOWN since it was my original plan, and it keeps me a bit more central which could be useful for accessing both sides of the board.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. DOWN now to (5, 3) (this move)\n2. RIGHT to (6, 3) - collect apple!\n3. Then consider going toward (9, 0) which is closer, or (9, 9)\n\nDOWN\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- My head is at (5, 4), body at (5, 5), (4, 5), and tail at (4, 6)\n- Turn 8 of 150\n- I'm ahead 3-0 in apples\n\nLet me evaluate my options from (5, 4):\n\n**UP: (5, 5)** - This is my body! DEATH!\n\n**DOWN: (5, 3)** - Safe, empty cell.\n\n**LEFT: (4, 4)** - Safe, empty cell.\n\n**RIGHT: (6, 4)** - Safe, empty cell.\n\nSafe moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\n\nChecking next-turn options for each safe move:\n- DOWN to (5, 3): Next turn I can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (3 options)\n- RIGHT to (6, 4): Next turn I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (3 options)  \n- LEFT to (4, 4): Next turn I can only go DOWN or LEFT (2 options - worse!)\n\nLEFT limits my future options, so I'll eliminate that.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead to the apple at (6, 3) in 2 turns:\n- DOWN path: (5, 3) \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 (6, 3) - apple!\n- RIGHT path: (6, 4) \u2192 DOWN \u2192 (6, 3) - apple!\n\nThe enemy at (3, 2) is likely heading toward apples at (2, 4) or (1, 4), so no collision risk for me going toward (6, 3).\n\nI'll continue with my original plan and go DOWN to stay more central.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. DOWN now to (5, 3) (this move)\n2. RIGHT to (6, 3) - collect apple!\n3. Then head toward (9, 0) or (9, 9)\n\nDOWN",

Moving into my own body = DEATH!\n\n4. **RIGHT: (7, 3)** - Safe, empty cell.\n\nSo LEFT is DEATH (moving into my body).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\nNow let me evaluate the best move:\n\n**Looking at apples:**\n- (2, 4) - distance from (6, 3) is |6-2| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps - but enemy snake is at (2, 3), just below this apple!\n- (1, 4) - distance is |6-1| + |3-4| = 5 + 1 = 6 steps - enemy nearby\n- (9, 9) - distance is |6-9| + |3-9| = 3 + 6 = 9 steps\n- (9, 0) - distance is |6-9| + |3-0| = 3 + 3 = 6 steps\n- (0, 6) - distance is |6-0| + |3-6| = 6 + 3 = 9 steps\n\nThe enemy snake at (2, 3) is very close to apples at (2, 4) and (1, 4). I should probably let them take those and focus on the right side of the board.\n\n(9, 0) is the closest apple I can reasonably go for without running into the enemy.\n\n**Analyzing paths:**\n\nTo get to (9, 0):\n- From (6, 3), I need to go RIGHT to increase x and DOWN to decrease y\n- Path could be: RIGHT to (7, 3), DOWN to (7, 2), DOWN to (7, 1), RIGHT to (8, 1), RIGHT to (9, 1), DOWN to (9, 0)\n- Or: DOWN to (6, 2), RIGHT to (7, 2), etc.\n\nLet me think about collision risks:\n\nEnemy at (2, 3) can move to:\n- UP: (2, 4) - apple!\n- DOWN: (2, 2)\n- LEFT: (1, 3)\n- RIGHT: (3, 3)\n\nThey'll probably go UP to (2, 4) to get the apple. They're far from me, so no collision risk this turn.\n\nLet me evaluate my safe moves:\n\n**UP to (6, 4):**\n- After moving: head at (6, 4), body at (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5) - wait, the tail moves so body would be (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5) minus the tail which moves... Actually since I didn't eat an apple, tail (4, 5) drops, so body becomes (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)\n- Hmm, that's weird. Let me reconsider. Currently I have:\n  - Head: (6, 3)\n  - Body: [(5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5)] - 4 body segments\n  - Wait, that means I'm 5 cells long (head + 4 body = 5), which makes sense with 4 apples.\n  \n- If I move UP to (6, 4) (no apple):\n  - New head: (6, 4)\n  - New body: (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5) - tail (4, 5) drops\n  - From (6, 4), I can go: UP to (6, 5), DOWN to (6, 3) - my body - DEATH, LEFT to (5, 4) - my body - DEATH, RIGHT to (7, 4)\n  - Only 2 safe options: UP, RIGHT\n\n**DOWN to (6, 2):**\n- After moving: head at (6, 2), body at (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5) - tail (4, 5) drops\n- From (6, 2), I can go: UP to (6, 3) - my body - DEATH, DOWN to (6, 1), LEFT to (5, 2), RIGHT to (7, 2)\n- 3 safe options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n- This moves me toward (9, 0)!\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 3):**\n- After moving: head at (7, 3), body at (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5) - tail (4, 5) drops\n- From (7, 3), I can go: UP to (7, 4), DOWN to (7, 2), LEFT to (6, 3) - my body - DEATH, RIGHT to (8, 3)\n- 3 safe options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n- This also moves me toward (9, 0) and (9, 9)\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT seem good! Let me think more strategically:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 3), then:\n- From (7, 3), I can go DOWN to (7, 2), then DOWN to (7, 1), etc.\n- Or I could go UP toward (9, 9) if I change plans\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2), then:\n- From (6, 2), I can go RIGHT to (7, 2), etc.\n\nThe paths are similar. Let me think about which gives me more flexibility.\n\nActually, let me think about my body position. After the move, my body will be:\n- If DOWN: (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)\n- If RIGHT: (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)\n\nSame body position either way.\n\nBut the head position matters for future turns. Let me think 2 moves ahead:\n\nIf DOWN to (6, 2), then RIGHT to (7, 2):\n- Head at (7, 2), body at (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)\n- From (7, 2): UP to (7, 3), DOWN to (7, 1), LEFT to (6, 2) - body, RIGHT to (8, 2)\n- 3 options\n\nIf RIGHT to (7, 3), then DOWN to (7, 2):\n- Head at (7, 2), body at (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)\n- From (7, 2): UP to (7, 3) - body, DOWN to (7, 1), LEFT to (6, 2), RIGHT to (8, 2)\n- 3 options\n\nSame result in terms of reaching (7, 2).\n\nBut wait, what if I want to go to (9, 9) instead? Let me consider:\n\nIf RIGHT to (7, 3), then UP to (7, 4):\n- Head at (7, 4), body at (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)\n- This is going toward (9, 9)\n\nIf DOWN to (6, 2), going to (9, 9) would require:\n- RIGHT to (7, 2), then UP to (7, 3), UP to (7, 4), etc.\n- Longer path\n\nSo RIGHT gives me more flexibility to go either toward (9, 0) or (9, 9).\n\nBut actually, let me reconsider the apple distances:\n- (9, 0) from (6, 3): 3 + 3 = 6 steps\n- (9, 9) from (6, 3): 3 + 6 = 9 steps\n\n(9, 0) is closer. And going DOWN gets me closer to it faster.\n\nActually, I think both moves are fine. Let me just pick DOWN since it's more direct toward (9, 0).\n\nWait, I should also think about whether the enemy could intercept me. The enemy at (2, 3) is unlikely to come toward (9, 0) since there are apples at (2, 4) and (1, 4) right next to them.\n\nLet me go with DOWN to head toward (9, 0).\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Going RIGHT keeps me at the same y-level, and from there I can easily go DOWN. But going DOWN first limits me slightly more because my body will be trailing behind in a specific pattern.\n\nHmm, let me think about this differently. My body is currently stretching from (6, 3) up through (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5). If I go DOWN, my body will be:\n- (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)\n\nIf I then want to go LEFT at some point, I'd hit my body at (5, 3). So going DOWN and then trying to go back toward the center would be problematic.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 3), my body will be:\n- (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)\n\nActually, the body is the same! So the constraint is the same.\n\nLet me just go with RIGHT since it gives me the option to go either UP toward (9, 9) or DOWN toward (9, 0), whereas DOWN commits me more toward the bottom.\n\nActually, you know what, I'm overthinking this. Both moves are safe and lead to good positions. Let me go with DOWN because it's the most direct path toward (9, 0), which is the closest uncontested apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. DOWN now to (6, 2) (this move)\n2. RIGHT to (7, 2)\n3. RIGHT to (8, 2) or DOWN to (7, 1)\n4. Continue toward (9, 0)\n5. After getting (9, 0), head up toward (9, 9)\n\nDOWN\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- My head is at (6, 3), body at (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5)\n- Turn 10 of 150\n- I'm ahead 4-0 in apples\n- Just collected the apple at (6, 3) last turn!\n\nLet me evaluate my options from (6, 3):\n\n**UP: (6, 4)** - Safe, empty cell.\n**DOWN: (6, 2)** - Safe, empty cell.\n**LEFT: (5, 3)** - This is my body! DEATH!\n**RIGHT: (7, 3)** - Safe, empty cell.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\n\nLooking at apple locations:\n- (2, 4) and (1, 4) - Enemy at (2, 3) is right next to these. They'll likely go for them.\n- (9, 0) - 6 steps away, uncontested!\n- (9, 9) - 9 steps away, uncontested\n- (0, 6) - 9 steps away, far and awkward to reach\n\nThe enemy is likely going UP to grab the apple at (2, 4). I should focus on the right side of the board where (9, 0) and (9, 9) are uncontested.\n\n**Evaluating safe moves:**\n\n- **DOWN to (6, 2)**: Heads toward (9, 0). From there I have 3 safe options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n- **RIGHT to (7, 3)**: Also heads toward (9, 0) and (9, 9). From there I have 3 safe options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\nBoth are good! RIGHT gives me slightly more flexibility to pivot toward either (9, 0) or (9, 9) depending on circumstances.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. RIGHT now to (7, 3) - keeps options open\n2. Then DOWN to (7, 2) or continue RIGHT toward (8, 3)\n3. Work my way to (9, 0)\n4. After (9, 0), head up toward (9, 9)\n\nRIGHT",
