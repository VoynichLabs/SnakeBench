I see five apples scattered around the board, and I'm aware of the position of the enemy snake #1 at (5, 8).\n\nMy initial thought is to head towards the nearest apple, which is at (5, 7). However, I need to be careful not to run into snake #1 or the wall. I'll try to move in a way that keeps me at a safe distance from both.\n\nStrategy: I'll try to move up and then to the right, aiming to get closer to the apple while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

This seems like a good direction as I can potentially collect multiple apples.\n\nMoving DOWN would start me toward the apples at (3, 3), (7, 2), and (9, 6), but requires more turns.\n\nMoving RIGHT doesn't immediately lead to any apples, though it could eventually lead to the apple at (9, 6).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT to (4, 7), I'll continue left to approach the apple at (2, 4) or potentially go for the apple at (0, 8) by moving up after getting closer to the left side.\n\nLEFT"
