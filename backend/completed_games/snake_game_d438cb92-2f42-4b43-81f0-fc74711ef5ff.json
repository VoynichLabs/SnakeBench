This gives a high probability of a quick apple bite in the near future and keeps development space open, since there\u2019s little risk of colliding with the enemy\u2019s head given the current positions.\n\nPlan:\n- Favor RIGHT to capitalize on the right-side apple cluster and keep options open for a looping path toward more apples on the east.

LEFT would step onto our own body and is fatal.  \n- RIGHT moves the head onto an apple at (3,5), immediately increasing our score and length while keeping the tail intact, which preserves all current body cells for future maneuvering.  \n- After eating the apple the new head will be at (3,5); the cells (4,5), (3,6), and (3,4) will remain empty, giving us at least three viable directions on the next turn.  \n- Moving UP or DOWN does not collect an apple and would shrink the snake (tail removal), reducing our length advantage without gaining immediate progress toward the many apples clustered to the right (e.g., (5,5), (6,4), (9,4), (9,5)).  \n- The enemy snake is positioned far to the right\u2011top (head at (8,8)) and is unlikely to reach (3,5) this turn, so a head\u2011on collision risk is negligible.  \n\n**Plan for the next few turns**  \n1. Move RIGHT now to eat the apple at (3,5) and grow.  \n2. Keep the head moving RIGHT or UP/RIGHT combinations to approach the dense apple cluster around x\u202f=\u202f5\u20119, y\u202f=\u202f0\u20115.  \n3. Monitor the enemy\u2019s position; if it begins to encroach on our path, shift upward to stay clear while still heading toward remaining apples.  \n4. Avoid getting trapped against the left wall or the growing body; maintain at least one open lateral direction.  \n\nRIGHT",

Monitor enemy movements and avoid creating tight traps. If the enemy approaches the bottom-right area, pivot to safer side corridors.",
