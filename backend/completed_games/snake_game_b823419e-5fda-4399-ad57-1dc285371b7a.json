          "move": "DOWN",
          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current situation. I am snake #1, and my head is at (1, 9). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9). My body is empty, so I have only one segment: my head.\n\nThe enemy snake is snake #0, with its head at (2, 0) and no body. Both snakes have 0 apples collected.\n\nApples are located at: (9, 4), (1, 0), (6, 6), (0, 0), (2, 1), (8, 9), (9, 5), (8, 4), (5, 8), (6, 1), (7, 7), (6, 3), (5, 7), (6, 8), (1, 5).\n\nThe board state is provided visually:\n\n```\n 9 . 1 . . . . . . A .\n 8 . . . . . A A . . .\n 7 . . . . . A . A . .\n 6 . . . . . . A . . .\n 5 . A . . . . . . . A\n 4 . . . . . . . . A A\n 3 . . . . . . A . . .\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . A . . . A . . .\n 0 A A 0 . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nI need to choose my move for this turn (turn 0/150). My last move information is None, so this is the first move of the game.\n\nSince both snakes have no body, the main dangers are moving off the board, moving into my own body (which doesn't exist yet), or moving into the enemy snake's body (which also doesn't exist yet). However, I must consider that the enemy snake will also move this turn, so if I move into the same cell as the enemy snake's head, we would both die. But since the enemy snake is at (2, 0), and I am at (1, 9), it's very unlikely we'll collide on the first move unless we both move directly towards each other, which is not possible in one step.\n\nLet me list the possible moves and evaluate them.\n\nMy current position: (1, 9)\n\nPossible directions:\n\n1. UP: Increasing y. (1, 9) -> (1, 10). y=10 is outside the board (y ranges from 0 to 9). So, moving UP would kill me immediately. Eliminate this move.\n\n2. DOWN: Decreasing y. (1, 9) -> (1, 8). Let's check the board. At (1, 8), from the board state, row 8, column 1: According to the ASCII, row 8 is: \". . . . . A A . . .\" which corresponds to columns 0-9. Column 1 is the second character. Let's list row 8 explicitly from the string:\n\n   Row 8: \". . . . . A A . . .\" -> spaces are for readability? Actually, in the provided text, it's:\n   \" 8 . . . . . A A . . .\"\n   So, column 0: '.'; column 1: '.'; column 2: '.'; column 3: '.'; column 4: '.'; column 5: 'A'; column 6: 'A'; column 7: '.'; column 8: '.'; column 9: '.'\n   So, (1,8) is '.' (empty). Also, no snake bodies are there. Enemy snake is at (2,0), so not there. So, this move seems safe immediately.\n\n3. LEFT: Decreasing x. (1, 9) -> (0, 9). Check (0,9): Row 9, column 0. Row 9: \" 9 . 1 . . . . . . A .\" \n   Column 0: '.' (empty). Column 1: '1' (that's me, but I'm moving, so my head will leave (1,9)). However, when I move, my body will grow? Actually, since I have no body yet, after moving, my new body will be my previous head position. But for collision check, we consider the state before the move or during? The rules say: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So, we check the target cell. (0,9) is empty (no snake body). Also, enemy is not there. So, safe.\n\n4. RIGHT: Increasing x. (1, 9) -> (2, 9). Check (2,9): Row 9, column 2. Row 9: column 2 is '.' (empty). No snake bodies. Safe.\n\nSo, all three directions (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) seem safe from immediate collision. UP is out of bounds, so invalid.\n\nNow, I need to consider future moves and strategy. I should aim to collect apples while avoiding trapping myself or colliding with the enemy. The enemy is at (2,0), which is far from me (at top-left corner vs bottom-right corner). So, collision risk is low initially.\n\nI should move towards apples. The nearest apples to me? From my position (1,9), I see apples at:\n- (8,9) is an apple? Wait, from the list: (8,9) is an apple. But on row 9, column 8 is '.'? Let's check row 9 carefully: \" 9 . 1 . . . . . . A .\" So, column 0: '.', column 1: '1' (me), column 2: '.', column 3: '.', column 4: '.', column 5: '.', column 6: '.', column 7: '.', column 8: '.', column 9: 'A'. Actually, looking at the string: after \" .\" for column 8? Let's index:\n\nThe string: \" 9 . 1 . . . . . . A .\"\n- After \"9 \" there are spaces? Actually, it's formatted with spaces. Let's read it as: characters: '9', '.', '1', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'A', '.'? That would be 11 characters? No, better to count positions.\n\nFrom the visual:\nColumn: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nRow 9:   . 1 . . . . . . . A\n\nYes, row 9: column 0: '.', column 1: '1' (me), column 2: '.', column 3: '.', column 4: '.', column 5: '.', column 6: '.', column 7: '.', column 8: '.', column 9: 'A'.\n\nSo, apple at (9,9) is listed? No, in the apple list, there is (8,9)? Wait, the apple list has (8,9). But in row 9, column 8 is '.' and column 9 is 'A'. So (9,9) is an apple? But in the list, I see (8,9) and (9,9) is not listed? Let's check the apple list again: \nApples at: (9, 4), (1, 0), (6, 6), (0, 0), (2, 1), (8, 9), (9, 5), (8, 4), (5, 8), (6, 1), (7, 7), (6, 3), (5, 7), (6, 8), (1, 5)\n\nSo, (8,9) is an apple. But on the board, row 9 column 8 is '.'? There might be a discrepancy. Let's check the board state for row 9: \" 9 . 1 . . . . . . A .\" \nInterpretation: After \"9 \" there is a space? Actually, the format is: \" 9 . 1 . . . . . . A .\" So, after \"9\" there is a space, then '.' for column 0? Or is the \"9\" the row number? Yes, the first character is the row number. So, for row 9, the string is: \" 9 . 1 . . . . . . A .\" \nSo, the symbols after the row number correspond to columns 0 to 9. Let's list them:\n- Column 0: '.'\n- Column 1: '1' (my head)\n- Column 2: '.'\n- Column 3: '.'\n- Column 4: '.'\n- Column 5: '.'\n- Column 6: '.'\n- Column 7: '.'\n- Column 8: '.'\n- Column 9: 'A'\n\nBut according to the apple list, there is an apple at (8,9). That would be row 9, column 8? But in the board, column 8 is '.' and column 9 is 'A'. So, (8,9) is not an apple? Or maybe (8,9) means x=8, y=9? In coordinates, (x,y) where x is horizontal, y is vertical. In the board display, rows are y, columns are x. So, for (x,y), x is column, y is row. So, (8,9) means column 8, row 9. But on the board, at row 9, column 8, we see '.'. So, perhaps the apple at (8,9) is not shown? Or maybe I misread.\n\nLet's check the apple list: (8,9) is listed. But in the board state, at row 9, column 8, it's '.'. Similarly, (9,9) is not in the list, but at row 9, column 9, it's 'A'. So, there might be an error, or perhaps the apple list is correct and the board display is simplified. I should trust the apple list provided.\n\nFrom the apple list, (8,9) is an apple. But from the board, it seems (9,9) is an apple. To be precise, I'll use the apple list. The board might have omissions or be a snapshot. The game state says \"Apples at: ...\" so that's authoritative.\n\nSo, apples near me: \nFrom (1,9):\n- (1,5) is an apple (from list). That's down 4 units.\n- (8,9) is an apple (from list), but that's to the right, x from 1 to 8, 7 steps away.\n- (9,4) is far.\n- (1,0) is down but on y=0, far.\n- (0,0) is also far.\n\nBut since I have no body yet, I can move freely. I should consider which apple is most reachable and safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake. Enemy is at (2,0). It might move towards apples as well. Which apples are near the enemy? From (2,0), apples at (1,0), (2,1), (0,0) are close. So, the enemy might go for those. I should avoid direct competition if possible.\n\nSince the game is long, I should not rush to distant apples if it means getting trapped. But with 150 turns, I have time.\n\nMy current position (1,9) is at the top edge. Moving DOWN gives me more space. Moving LEFT or RIGHT might keep me near the edge but could limit future moves.\n\nLet's evaluate each move in terms of future options:\n\n- DOWN to (1,8): From (1,8), I can move DOWN to (1,7), LEFT to (0,8), RIGHT to (2,8), UP back to (1,9) but that would be moving into my own body (since after moving to (1,8), my body will be at (1,9)). So, moving UP would be suicide. So, from (1,8), I have three safe directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. I should avoid moving UP because that would hit my own body. So, future options are good.\n\n- LEFT to (0,9): From (0,9), I can move DOWN to (0,8), RIGHT to (1,9) (which is now my body, so suicide), or UP (out of bounds). So, only safe move from (0,9) is DOWN. That means I get trapped with only one move: DOWN. This is bad for future flexibility.\n\n- RIGHT to (2,9): From (2,9), I can move DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9) (suicide), RIGHT to (3,9), or UP (out of bounds? y=9 is top, so UP to y=10 out of bounds). So, from (2,9), safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT. That's two options, better than LEFT but still limited.\n\nSo, in terms of keeping options open, DOWN seems best because from (1,8), I have three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), whereas LEFT gives only one, RIGHT gives two.\n\nAlso, considering apples: From (1,8), I am closer to apples like (1,5) which is down 3 steps, and (6,1) etc. But from (1,9), moving DOWN directly towards (1,5) makes sense.\n\nWhat about the enemy? Enemy is at (2,0). If I move DOWN, I'm moving away from the enemy, so collision risk is low. If I move RIGHT, I might go towards the center, but enemy is far.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might move towards the apples near its position. Since it has no body, it can move freely too.\n\nMy long-term plan: Start by moving towards the apples in the lower left or center. Since I'm at (1,9), moving DOWN towards (1,5) apple seems reasonable. From there, I can go to other apples like (0,0) or (6,1) etc.\n\nBut note: (1,5) is an apple. From (1,9) to (1,5) is 4 moves down. But if I move DOWN now, I'll be at (1,8), then I can continue DOWN.\n\nHowever, I need to avoid getting trapped. Since I have no body yet, I can always turn later.\n\nAlso, from (1,8), I can move LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8), which might lead to other apples. For example, from (0,8), I can go DOWN to (0,7), etc., towards (0,0) apple.\n\nBut (0,0) is an apple, but there is also an apple at (1,0). However, (1,0) is near the enemy at (2,0). So, if I go for (1,0), I might compete with the enemy. That could be dangerous if the enemy is also going for it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is an apple, close to enemy.\n\nI should consider the enemy's likely move. The enemy is at (2,0). From there, it can move UP to (2,1), LEFT to (1,0), RIGHT to (3,0), or DOWN (out of bounds? y=0 is bottom, so DOWN to y=-1 out of bounds). So, safe moves for enemy: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Which one would it choose? Probably towards an apple. Apples near (2,0): (2,1) is directly UP, (1,0) is LEFT, (0,0) is LEFT and DOWN? Actually from (2,0), (0,0) is LEFT twice. So, likely the enemy might go for (2,1) or (1,0). If it goes for (2,1), then after moving, its head will be at (2,1) and it will have eaten an apple? Actually, if it moves to (2,1), which is an apple, it will grow. But in this turn, since we move simultaneously, if I move to (2,1) as well, we collide and both die. So, I should avoid moving to cells that the enemy might move to.\n\nSince the enemy is at (2,0), and I am at (1,9), there is no immediate risk of collision unless I move to (2,0) or (1,0) or something, but that's not in my options.\n\nFrom my options, if I move RIGHT to (2,9), that's far from the enemy. So, no collision risk.\n\nBut if I move DOWN to (1,8), also safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,9), safe.\n\nNow, which move gives me the best chance to eat apples soon? The closest apple to me is (1,5), which is 4 moves down. But there might be other apples closer in terms of Manhattan distance.\n\nLet's list all apples and their distance from (1,9):\n- (9,4): distance |9-1| + |4-9| = 8 + 5 = 13\n- (1,0): |1-1| + |0-9| = 0 + 9 = 9\n- (6,6): |6-1| + |6-9| = 5 + 3 = 8\n- (0,0): |0-1| + |0-9| = 1 + 9 = 10\n- (2,1): |2-1| + |1-9| = 1 + 8 = 9\n- (8,9): |8-1| + |9-9| = 7 + 0 = 7\n- (9,5): |9-1| + |5-9| = 8 + 4 = 12\n- (8,4): |8-1| + |4-9| = 7 + 5 = 12\n- (5,8): |5-1| + |8-9| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- (6,1): |6-1| + |1-9| = 5 + 8 = 13\n- (7,7): |7-1| + |7-9| = 6 + 2 = 8\n- (6,3): |6-1| + |3-9| = 5 + 6 = 11\n- (5,7): |5-1| + |7-9| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- (6,8): |6-1| + |8-9| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- (1,5): |1-1| + |5-9| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,5) with distance 4. Then (5,8) and (5,7) and (6,8) with distance 5 or 6. But (1,5) is directly below me, so moving DOWN is towards it.\n\n(8,9) is distance 7, but that's to the right. However, moving RIGHT to (2,9) doesn't directly head towards (8,9); it heads towards the center.\n\n(5,8) is at distance 5, which might be reachable via a path.\n\nBut since (1,5) is the closest and directly in the line, I should go for it.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that as I move, the body grows, so after eating an apple, I will have a body segment, which might block me later. But since I'm early in the game, it should be fine.\n\nAlso, the enemy might go for apples near it, so competition for (1,5) might be low because it's far from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,0), so (1,5) is 5 units away in y and 1 in x? Manhattan distance |2-1| + |0-5| = 1+5=6, so not too close. The enemy might go for closer apples like (2,1) or (1,0).\n\nSo, going for (1,5) seems safe.\n\nNow, which move to start? To go to (1,5), I need to move DOWN repeatedly. So, moving DOWN now is the first step.\n\nBut what about the immediate board? If I move DOWN to (1,8), is there any apple there? No, (1,8) is empty. From (1,8), I can continue DOWN to (1,7), etc.\n\nI should also check if there are any dangers. From the board state, at (1,8), it's empty. Similarly, (1,7) is empty? Row 7: \" 7 . . . . . A . A . .\" so column 1 is '.' (empty). (1,6): row 6: \" 6 . . . . . . A . . .\" column 1 is '.'. (1,5): row 5: \" 5 . A . . . . . . . A\" so column 1 is 'A' (apple). So, the path down is clear until the apple.\n\nBut wait, the board state shows only current positions and apples. As I move, new apples might appear? No, apples are fixed until eaten. So, the path seems clear.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that after I move, my body will be at (1,9). So, if I continue DOWN, after moving to (1,8), my body is at (1,9). Then if I move DOWN to (1,7), my body will be at (1,8) and (1,9). So, I cannot move UP from (1,7) because that would hit my own body. But that's fine; I can keep going DOWN.\n\nBut from (1,7), if I want to go to (1,5), I need to go DOWN twice more: to (1,6) then (1,5). So, I can do that.\n\nNow, are there any other apples on the way? From (1,7) to (1,5), there is no apple on (1,6) or (1,5) only at (1,5). So, I'll eat the apple when I reach (1,5).\n\nAfter eating the apple, I will grow. That means after moving to (1,5), my body will be: head at (1,5), body at (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). Actually, since I started with no body, after first move to (1,8), my body is just (1,9). After second move to (1,7), body is (1,8), (1,9). After third move to (1,6), body is (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). After fourth move to (1,5), I eat the apple, so I grow: my new body will include the old body plus the previous head? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. The rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\" So, after moving onto the apple, your body extends by one segment. Typically in snake games, after eating, the tail does not move for that turn, so the length increases by one. But here, since we move simultaneously, when I move to (1,5), I eat the apple, so my body will be: head at (1,5), and the previous body segments plus the new segment? Actually, the body segments are the previous positions. Since I have been moving DOWN, my body will be: after eating, the head is (1,5), and the body includes (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). So, length 5 (head + 4 body segments). But that's fine.\n\nNow, after that, I can continue exploring. But since I'm only at turn 0, I need to decide the first move.\n\nConsidering all, moving DOWN seems optimal for future flexibility and heading towards the closest apple.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any risks I missed. What about the enemy moving? If the enemy moves UP to (2,1), which is an apple, it will eat it. That might give it an advantage, but I'm far away, so it doesn't affect me directly.\n\nIf I move DOWN, I'm not competing with the enemy for now.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I might go towards the center where there are apples like (5,8), but that's farther.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I get trapped at the left edge, which is bad.\n\nSo, I think DOWN is the best choice.\n\nTherefore, my move for this turn is DOWN.\n\nFinally, I need to output only the word: DOWNDOWN",

I have 0 apples.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0)**: Head at (0, 0). Body includes (1, 0) and (2, 0). Enemy has 2 apples.\n    *   **Apples**: There are 15 apples on the board. Notably, there are dense clusters. One cluster is at the top right: (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 4). Another is in the upper-middle: (6, 6), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (7, 7), (6, 3). There are also apples at (0, 9) and (1, 5) which are very close to me.\n\n2.  **Immediate Threats & Survival**:\n    *   **Off-board**: My x is 1, y is 9.\n        *   LEFT (x=0): Safe.\n        *   RIGHT (x=2): Safe.\n        *   DOWN (y=8): Safe.\n        *   UP (y=10): **DEAD** (y must be <= 9).\n    *   **Self-Collision**: I have no body. No risk.\n    *   **Enemy Body**: Enemy body is at y=0 (low). I am at y=9 (top). No collision risk.\n    *   **Enemy Head Movement**: Enemy head is at (0, 0). With 2 apples, the enemy is likely growing and moving. If the enemy moves UP to (0, 1), RIGHT to (1, 0), or DOWN (illegal), or LEFT (illegal), they will not reach me this turn. Max distance: 9 grid cells. Enemy moves 1 cell. I am safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\n3.  **Strategic Options & Apple Prioritization**:\n    *   **Cluster 1 (Top Left - Closest)**:\n        *   Target: (0, 9). This is directly LEFT of my head.\n        *   Path: Move LEFT to (0, 9).\n        *   Benefit: Immediate apple consumption (Point 1). This grows my body (adding (1, 9) to my body). Starting the growth early is crucial for survival and reach.\n        *   Future options: From (0, 9), I can access (0, 8) or (1, 9).\n    *   **Cluster 2 (Top Right - Long term)**:\n        *   Targets: (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 4).\n        *   Path: Requires moving RIGHT (increasing x). Distance is ~8-9 turns.\n        *   Risk: The enemy is at (0, 0). The enemy might also pursue the top-right cluster or the central cluster. However, the top-left apple is unclaimed and \"free\".\n    *   **Cluster 3 (Middle - Secondary)**:\n        *   Targets: (1, 5), (2, 1), (6, 3).\n        *   (1, 5) is 4 steps DOWN. (6, 3) is 5 steps RIGHT/DOWN.\n\n4.  **Decision Logic**:\n    *   **Avoiding Conflict**: The enemy has 2 apples and is likely focused on their own survival/growth. They are far away.\n    *   **Growth Priority**: My survival depends on growing my body. The apple at (0, 9) is the closest apple (distance 1).\n    *   **Safety**: Moving LEFT to (0, 9) puts me at the edge. This is slightly restrictive (only 2 exit paths: DOWN or RIGHT), but at turn 2 with a short body, this is negligible. The immediate gain of an apple outweighs the minor pathing restriction.\n    *   **Alternative (RIGHT)**: Moving RIGHT to (2, 9) keeps me in the open but misses the (0, 9) apple. The (0, 9) apple is valuable because it is immediately accessible and securing it denies it from potential future paths.\n    *   **Alternative (DOWN)**: Moving DOWN to (1, 8) moves towards the central cluster, but is slower than grabbing the immediate apple.\n\n5.  **Final Choice**:\n    *   Move **LEFT**.\n    *   Result: Head becomes (0, 9). Eat Apple. Body becomes [(1, 9)].\n    *   This secures the first point and prepares for the next move towards the center or other apples.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note**:\nSecure the immediate apple at (0, 9) to start growing. Once grown, navigate towards the dense central cluster (around 1,5 or 6,3) while keeping an eye on the enemy's position. Avoid the top-right corner initially as it is a potential dead-end if the enemy approaches.\n\nLEFT",

I will check the board state carefully.\n    *   **Apples**: The apple at (0, 9) is gone (eaten by me). The apple at (1, 5) is still there. The apple at (2, 1) is there. The apple at (6, 3) is there. The cluster at the top right is intact.\n\n2.  **Immediate Threats & Survival (From Head (0, 9))**:\n    *   **Off-board**:\n        *   LEFT (x=-1): **DEAD**.\n        *   RIGHT (x=1): Safe.\n        *   UP (y=10): **DEAD**.\n        *   DOWN (y=8): Safe.\n    *   **Self-Collision**: My body is at (1, 9). If I move RIGHT, I hit my own body. **RIGHT is DEATH**.\n    *   **Enemy Body**:\n        *   The enemy body is near (0,0). It is not near (0,9). Safe.\n    *   **Enemy Head**: The enemy is likely moving. If the enemy moves UP to (0, 2) or RIGHT to (1, 1), there is no collision with me at (0, 9).\n\n3.  **Strategic Options (From (0, 9))**:\n    *   **Option 1: DOWN (to 0, 8)**:\n        *   *Safety*: Safe. (0, 8) is empty.\n        *   *Pathing*: Opens up movement to (0, 7), (1, 8), etc.\n        *   *Apple Access*: Moves me closer to the central cluster (1, 5) and (2, 1). Distance to (1, 5) is 4 steps (currently 5 steps).\n        *   *Long-term*: This is the best direction to leave the corner and re-enter the game board. It allows me to loop back to the right or continue down.\n    *   **Option 2: UP (to 0, 10)**:\n        *   *Safety*: **DEAD**.\n    *   **Option 3: LEFT (to -1, 9)**:\n        *   *Safety*: **DEAD**.\n    *   **Option 4: RIGHT (to 1, 9)**:\n        *   *Safety*: **DEAD**. My body is at (1, 9).\n\n4.  **Decision Logic**:\n    *   The only legal move that doesn't result in immediate death is **DOWN**.\n    *   **Risk Assessment**: I am currently in the top-left corner. This is a dangerous position. Moving DOWN to (0, 8) frees me up. I must be careful not to get trapped in the corner later.\n    *   **Strategy**: Move DOWN to escape the corner. From (0, 8), I can look at the apples at (1, 5) or (2, 1). The enemy is far away at the bottom. I need to start navigating towards the center to collect apples and avoid being starved out.\n\n5.  **Final Choice**:\n    *   Move **DOWN**.\n    *   Result: Head becomes (0, 8). Body becomes [(0, 9), (1, 9)]. (The tail at (1, 9) might shift if I don't eat, but actually, since I didn't eat this turn, the tail moves forward. Wait, I ate last turn. My body length is 2. The tail is at (1, 9). Moving to (0, 8) updates the head. The new body list will be [(0, 8), (0, 9)]. The tail (1, 9) is removed).\n    *   This is the only move that allows survival and progression.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note**:\nI am currently in the top-left corner. Moving DOWN is the only option. After reaching (0, 8), I need to navigate out of the corner. The goal is to reach the central apples ((1, 5) or (2, 1)). I must avoid being boxed in. The enemy is at the bottom, so I have some breathing room, but I should not linger in the corner.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

From (1, 1), their options are limited:\n        *   **LEFT (0, 1)**: Dead (collides with own body).\n        *   **RIGHT (2, 1)**: Likely safe and moves toward an apple.\n        *   **DOWN (1, 0)**: Likely safe (seems open).\n        *   **UP (1, 2)**: Safe.\n        *   *Prediction*: Enemy will likely move **RIGHT** to (2, 1) to eat the apple, growing their length to 4. This moves their head away from my immediate path.\n\n3.  **Board Analysis (Head at 0, 8)**:\n    *   **Threats & Obstacles**:\n        *   **My Body**: (0, 9) is directly above. Moving UP returns to (0, 9). While technically valid (it's the tail, which will move if I don't eat), it is a tight squeeze and risks getting stuck in the corner again. It is safer to move away from the body.\n        *   **Board Edges**:\n            *   LEFT (x=-1): **DEAD**.\n            *   UP (y=9): Safe (occupied by my body, but legal).\n            *   RIGHT (x=1): **OCCUPIED**. The cell (1, 8) contains a 'T' in the board state, representing my tail from the previous turn? No, wait. My body is [(0, 9)]. The 'T' at (1, 8) is from the initial board state or a static marker? Let's re-read the board state carefully.\n    *   **Board State Re-evaluation**:\n        *   Row 8: `1 . . A . A A . . .` -> This row contains the apple at (3, 8) and (5, 8). The `1` is my head at (0, 8). The dots indicate empty space.\n        *   Row 9: `T . . . . . . . A .` -> The `T` at (0, 9) represents my tail/body. The dots are empty.\n        *   *Correction*: The 'T' in the board state visualization is just a placeholder for the snake body? No, the text says \"T\" in the grid. In the data, my body is explicitly listed as `[(0, 9)]`.\n        *   Let's look at the specific cell (1, 8). In the board state row 8, the second character is `.` (dot), meaning empty.\n        *   *Wait*, looking at the provided board state again:\n            `9 T . . . . . . . A .`\n            `8 1 . . A A A . . .`\n        *   My head is at (0, 8) marked as '1'.\n        *   The cell (1, 8) is marked as `.` (empty).\n        *   The cell (0, 9) is marked as `T` (my body).\n        *   Therefore, (1, 8) is **OPEN**.\n        *   The cell (0, 7) is marked as `.` (empty).\n        *   The cell (1, 8) is empty. Moving RIGHT is safe from immediate collision.\n    *   **Self-Collision**: Moving UP to (0, 9) hits my body. While legal, it's a bad tactical move.\n    *   **Enemy Body**: The enemy is far away (near (0,0)-(2,1)). No threat here.\n    *   **Enemy Head**: Predicted at (2, 1) or (1, 2). No threat to (0, 8).\n\n4.  **Strategic Options**:\n    *   **UP (0, 9)**: Hits body. Tactically poor. Keeps me in the corner.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 7)**: Safe. Moves deeper into the left column. This is a long corridor. While safe, it restricts movement options to strictly vertical or rightward. It's a \"tunnel\".\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 8)**: Safe. Moves toward the center. Opens up future moves to (2, 8), (1, 9), (1, 7). It connects to the cluster of apples at (3, 8) and (5, 8).\n    *   **LEFT (-1, 8)**: Dead.\n\n5.  **Decision**:\n    *   **RIGHT** is the superior move. It breaks the isolation of the left wall and positions me on the perimeter of the central board. From (1, 8), I can easily target the apple at (3, 8) or navigate to (5, 8).\n    *   Moving **DOWN** into the column (0, 7) is safer in terms of avoiding the enemy (who is at the bottom right), but it limits my ability to collect apples in the top half of the board. The apple at (3, 8) is only 2 steps away via (1, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (3, 8).\n    *   The enemy is far away and currently eating at the bottom. I have time to collect top-left apples.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note**:\nI am breaking out of the corner to the right. Targeting the apple at (3, 8) is the immediate priority. From (1, 8), I can move to (2, 8) next turn. I need to be careful not to trap myself against the right wall later, but for now, expanding my board presence is crucial. I will avoid the vertical column (0, 7) to maintain flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

A .`\n            `8 1 . . A A A . . .` (Wait, I am at (1, 8) now, so row 8 should start with a dot or `1`).\n            *Correction*: The visual grid provided in the prompt might be slightly stylized or I need to trust the text data over the ASCII art if they conflict, but usually the ASCII art is the source of truth for spatial layout.\n            Let's look at the provided text grid again:\n            `9 . . . . . . . .

A .` (Row 9, x=0 is 'T')\n            `8 1 . . A A A . . .` (Row 8, x=0 is '1')\n            `7 . . . . . A . A . .` (Row 7)\n            ...\n            `1 T T 0 . . . A . . .` (Row 1, x=0 is 'T', x=1 is 'T', x=2 is '0')\n            `0 T . . . . . . . . .` (Row 0, x=0 is 'T')\n            \n            **Hypothesis**: The grid is showing the state *before* my move, or there is a translation error.\n            Wait, \"Turn: 5 / 150\" means the move is about to happen. The state provided is the state *after* Turn 4.\n            My last move was RIGHT.\n            If I was at (0, 8) and moved RIGHT, I should be at (1, 8).\n            If the grid shows '1' at (0, 8), then the grid is reflecting my *previous* position or is slightly off.\n            \n            **Let's trust the text description of my coordinates**: `Head: (1, 8)`.\n            If I am at (1, 8), then the cell (0, 8) is my body (the tail segment).\n            The grid shows '1' at (0, 8) and 'T' at (0, 9). This matches my body list: `Body: [(0, 8), (0, 9)]`.\n            So the grid '1' actually represents my *body* or the visualization is just a bit static.\n            **Actually**, looking at the \"Board state\" text block provided in the prompt:\n            `8 1 . . A A A . . .`\n            If my head is at (1, 8), and the grid shows `1` at (0, 8), this is a visual representation quirk where the '1' marks the tail, or the text coordinate is wrong.\n            *Self-Correction*: In the previous turn's rationale, I analyzed the grid `8 1 . . A A A . . .` and correctly identified the dot at (1, 8) as empty.\n            So, the grid `1` is at (0, 8). My head is at (1, 8).\n            This means the grid shows the *tail* as '1' or it's a generic marker.\n            **Crucial**: The prompt says `Head: (1, 8)`. I must trust this. The grid is a visual aid.\n            \n            *Re-evaluating the Board for Safety*:\n            My Head: (1, 8).\n            My Body: (0, 8), (0, 9).\n            \n            **Enemy Analysis**:\n            Enemy Head: (2, 1).\n            Enemy Body: (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0).\n            Apples: (9,4), (6,6)... (1,5).\n            \n            **Available Moves from (1, 8)**:\n            1.  **UP (1, 9)**:\n                *   Coord: (1, 9).\n                *   Grid Row 9: `T . . . . . . . A .` -> (1, 9) is `.` (empty).\n                *   Is it safe? Yes, visually empty.\n                *   Is it safe from body? My body is (0,8) and (0,9). (1,9) is not my body.\n                *   Is it safe from enemy? Yes.\n                *   Does it eat an apple? No.\n                *   Tactical: Moves me to the top edge. Limits upward movement (already at y=9). Next moves would be Left, Right, or Down.\n            \n            2.  **DOWN (1, 7)**:\n                *   Coord: (1, 7).\n                *   Grid Row 7: `. . . . . A . A . .` -> (1, 7) is `.` (empty).\n                *   Is it safe? Yes.\n                *   Tactical: Moves into the open space. Opens up movement towards (5,8) or (3,8) apples.\n            \n            3.  **LEFT (0, 8)**:\n                *   Coord: (0, 8).\n                *   Grid Row 8: `1 . . ...` -> (0, 8) contains `1` (my body).\n                *   **COLLISION**. I die.\n            \n            4.  **RIGHT (2, 8)**:\n                *   Coord: (2, 8).\n                *   Grid Row 8: `1 . . A A A . . .` -> (2, 8) is `.` (empty).\n                *   Is it safe? Yes.\n                *   Tactical: Moves closer to the apple cluster at (3,8), (5,8).\n            \n            **Comparing Safe Moves**:\n            *   **UP (1, 9)**: Safe, but I hit the top wall. This reduces my freedom of movement immediately. I can only go Left, Right, or Down. If I go Left to (0,9), I hit my body. So from (1,9), I can only go Right to (2,9) or Down to (1,8). This is a tight spot.\n            *   **DOWN (1, 7)**: Safe. Opens up the board. From (1,7), I can see the board. (0,7) is empty, (2,7) is empty, (1,6) is empty. This gives me 3 forward options (Left, Right, Down, excluding Up which goes back to (1,8) which is valid but usually bad). Actually, going back is valid as the tail moves. But moving into open space is better.\n            *   **RIGHT (2, 8)**: Safe. Moves towards apples. From (2,8), I see (2,9) is empty, (3,8) is an apple, (2,7) is empty, (1,8) is my tail (valid). This is also good.\n            \n            **Apple Priority**:\n            Target apples: (3,8) is 1 step away via RIGHT (if I move to (2,8), then (3,8)).\n            (5,8) is also nearby.\n            \n            **Decision**:\n            Moving **DOWN** to (1, 7) seems the most flexible. It avoids the top wall immediately and puts me in a position to approach the apples from a lower angle or continue right.\n            However, moving **RIGHT** to (2, 8) puts me directly in line with the apples at (3,8) and (5,8).\n            \n            Let's look at the enemy again. The enemy is at (2, 1). They are far away. No threat.\n            \n            **Risk Assessment**:\n            *   UP: Constricts movement immediately. Bad.\n            *   DOWN: Safe, open space.\n            *   RIGHT: Safe, moves towards apples.\n            \n            If I move RIGHT to (2, 8), I am closer to the apple at (3, 8). If I move DOWN to (1, 7), I have to travel (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (2,8) -> (3,8) to get the apple, or (1,7)->(1,8)->(2,8)->(3,8) (looping).\n            \n            Moving RIGHT directly secures the path to the apple cluster.\n            From (2, 8), I can then move to (3, 8) to eat the apple.\n            \n            **Wait**, let's check the board state for (2, 8) again.\n            Row 8: `1 . . A A A . . .`\n            Columns: 0=1, 1=., 2=., 3=A, 4=A, 5=A...\n            So (2, 8) is empty.\n            \n            Let's check (1, 7).\n            Row 7: `. . . . . A . A . .`\n            (1, 7) is empty.\n            \n            **Why DOWN might be better long term**:\n            Moving DOWN avoids the right wall. The board is 10x10 (0-9). (2,8) is very close to the right wall (x=9) in terms of available space? No, x=2 is left side.\n            Actually, (1,8) -> RIGHT -> (2,8) -> RIGHT -> (3,8) -> ... -> (9,8).\n            Moving DOWN gives me access to the center of the board.\n            \n            **Crucial Logic**:\n            I am at (1, 8). I want to eat apples.\n            Apples at (3,8), (5,8).\n            To reach (3,8), I need to be at (2,8) or (3,7) or (3,9).\n            (2,8) is the most direct route.\n            \n            If I move DOWN to (1,7), I am not moving *towards* the apples, I am moving *parallel* to them.\n            If I move RIGHT to (2,8), I am moving *towards* them.\n            \n            Therefore, **RIGHT** is the aggressive, apple-seeking move.\n            **DOWN** is the conservative, space-seeking move.\n            \n            Given I have plenty of turns (150, currently 5), and the enemy is far away, I should secure the apples. The apples at (3,8) and (5,8) are high density.\n            \n            However, moving RIGHT puts my head at (2, 8).\n            Next turn, I can move to (3, 8) and eat the apple.\n            \n            Let's double check the \"Moving backwards\" rule.\n            \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself.\"\n            My body is [(0, 8), (0, 9)].\n            If I move RIGHT to (2, 8), the tail moves from (0, 9) to (0, 8).\n            Next turn, if I wanted to move LEFT (back to 1,8), that would be safe because the tail would have moved.\n            But if I move RIGHT to (2,8), I am not moving backwards.\n            \n            **Final Decision**:\n            Move **RIGHT** to (2, 8).\n            Reason: Directly approaches the nearest apple cluster ((3,8), (5,8)). It's a step forward in objective completion. The space is open and safe. The top wall is not yet a constraint (I am at y=8, can go to y=9 if needed, but I won't be forced to yet).\n            \n            Wait, looking at the board again.\n            Row 8: `1 . . A A A . . .`\n            If I am at (1,8) (Head), (0,8) is tail.\n            Moving RIGHT to (2,8) is empty.\n            \n            What if the enemy moves up? Enemy is at (2,1). Even if they moved up every turn, it would take them ~7 turns to reach me. I am safe.\n            \n            So, I will move RIGHT.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove RIGHT to (2, 8) to approach the apple cluster at (3, 8) and (5, 8). From there, I will target (3, 8) next turn to grow. I need to ensure I don't trap myself against the top wall or right wall later, but for now, securing points is priority.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

Body is [(1, 8), (0, 8)]. (Note: The body length is consistent with 1 collected apple).\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0)**: Head at (3, 1). Body extends from (2, 1) to (0, 1) and likely (0, 0). They are far away in the bottom left. No immediate threat.\n    *   **Board Geometry**: I am at y=8 (second from top). Top wall is at y=9.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves from (2, 8)**:\n    *   **UP (2, 9)**: Valid coordinates. Check board state: Row 9 at x=2 is `.` (empty). My body is at (1, 8) and (0, 8). Enemy is far away. This move is safe. However, it moves me to the top wall, which can be restrictive in future turns.\n    *   **DOWN (2, 7)**: Valid coordinates. Check board state: Row 7 at x=2 is `.` (empty). This keeps me in the open central area. This is safe and flexible.\n    *   **LEFT (1, 8)**: Valid coordinates. However, (1, 8) is currently occupied by my own body segment (specifically, the segment immediately following my head). Moving here is a collision. **Invalid**.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 8)**: Valid coordinates. Check board state: Row 8 at x=3 is `A` (Apple). This is a target. My body is at (1, 8) and (0, 8), so no collision. Enemy is far away. This move is safe and eats an apple.\n\n3.  **Comparing Safe Moves (UP vs DOWN vs RIGHT)**:\n    *   **UP**: Safe, but limits vertical movement (only one row left). Increases risk of getting trapped against the wall. Low immediate reward.\n    *   **DOWN**: Safe, maximizes freedom of movement (can go Up, Left, Right, or further Down). Good for long-term survival. Low immediate reward.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Safe, leads directly to an apple at (3, 8). Eating the apple increases score (currently 1 vs Enemy 3) and extends body length (helping survive longer). Moving to (3, 8) also positions me to potentially go for the apple at (5, 8) next.\n\n4.  **Strategy**:\n    *   The enemy is not a threat yet.\n    *   Eating apples is crucial to catch up in score (1 vs 3).\n    *   While `DOWN` offers maximum flexibility, `RIGHT` offers a guaranteed point gain and positions me well for the next apple cluster.\n    *   Moving to (3, 8) is safe from walls (can go to x=4,5...) and safe from body (my tail moves to (1, 8) next turn, clearing (2, 8)).\n    *   The \"Top Wall\" danger is manageable from (3, 8) as I can move Down, Left, or Right next turn.\n\n**Decision**: I will move **RIGHT** to eat the apple at (3, 8) and gain a point.\n\n**Long-term Plan**:\nEat the apple at (3, 8). Next turn, evaluate moving to (5, 8) (requires 2 moves: e.g., RIGHT to (4,8) then RIGHT to (5,8)) or securing position. Maintain awareness of the enemy snake's approach.\n\nRIGHT",

My head is now at (3, 8) and I ate the apple there. My body is now [(2, 8), (1, 8)].\n2.  **Enemy Snake #0**: Head is at (4, 1). Body: [(3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)]. They are far away in the bottom-left quadrant. No immediate collision risk.\n3.  **Apple Evaluation**:\n    *   My current position (3, 8) is on the top row (y=8). The wall is at y=9.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 8)**: Empty space. However, it moves me closer to the right wall (x=9) without an immediate apple reward. From (4, 8), I would have to go to (5, 8) to get the apple. That is two moves away.\n    *   **UP (3, 9)**: Wall. Dead end. Extremely dangerous. I would be trapped against the wall at the top-right corner.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 8)**: This is my current body segment (the neck). Moving there is suicide. Invalid.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 7)**: Open space. Row 7 at x=3 is `.` (empty). This move opens up my options significantly. From (3, 7), I can access apples at (5, 8) (via RIGHT+UP or UP+RIGHT) or apples at (6, 6)/ (7, 7). It also keeps me away from the immediate wall danger.\n\n4.  **Strategy & Safety**:\n    *   **Avoid Walls**: Staying at y=8 puts me against the wall. Moving **DOWN** to y=7 creates a buffer and allows vertical maneuvering.\n    *   **Path to Apples**: The apple at (5, 8) is a high-value target. However, going RIGHT directly from (3, 8) commits me to the top row. Going DOWN first to (3, 7) gives me more flexibility to approach (5, 8) or pivot to the cluster at (6, 6).\n    *   **No Immediate Threat**: The enemy is distant, and no other snakes are in range. The move does not place me in a crossfire.\n\n5.  **Decision**:\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (3, 7) is the only move that avoids walls, avoids self-collision, and maximizes future mobility. It positions me to chase the apple at (5, 8) or (6, 6) on the next turn while keeping all options open.\n\n**Long-term Plan**:\nDrop down to y=7 to regain vertical maneuvering room. Next turn, evaluate the best route to the apple at (5, 8) or the cluster at (6, 6). Maintain distance from the enemy snake (ID 0) who is currently in the bottom-left.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

My body occupies (3, 8) (directly above) and (2, 8) (top-left diagonal). I have 2 apples.\n\n2.  **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   **Head:** (5, 1)\n    *   **Body:** [(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)]\n    *   **Position:** They are in the bottom-right of the bottom-left quadrant. They are far away (vertical distance 6, horizontal distance 2). They pose no immediate threat to my head position (3, 7).\n\n3.  **Apples:**\n    *   My head (3, 7) is currently standing on an apple (indicated by the `1` in the board state at row 7, column 3). Wait, looking at the board state provided:\n        `7 . . . 1 . A . A A .`\n        The character at (3, 7) is `1`, which represents my head.\n    *   However, the \"Apples at\" list includes `(6, 1)`, `(5, 8)`, `(6, 5)`, `(6, 6)`, etc.\n    *   Let's re-examine the board state coordinates:\n        *   Row 7 (`y=7`): `. . . 1 . A . A A .`\n        *   Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3 (my head `1`), 4, 5 (`A`), 6, 7 (`A`), 8, 9.\n        *   So, at (5, 7) there is an apple. At (7, 7) there is an apple. At (8, 7) there is an apple.\n    *   Wait, looking at the \"Apples at\" list provided in the prompt:\n        `(5, 8)` - This is to my right/up.\n        `(6, 6)` - This is below and right.\n        `(5, 7)` - This is directly to my right (x=5, y=7).\n    \n    *   **Correction:** The \"Apples at\" list and the ASCII board might have slight visual discrepancies or I need to trust the list. The prompt says \"Apples at: (9, 4)...\" and the board shows `A`s. Let's verify the board's `A`s against the list.\n        *   Board Row 7 (`y=7`): `(5, 7)` is `A`. `(7, 7)` is `A`. `(8, 7)` is `A`.\n        *   List contains `(5, 7)`. List does *not* contain `(7, 7)` or `(8, 7)`.\n        *   **Crucial Check:** The prompt says \"The board state:\" followed by the ASCII. Then \"Apples at: ...\". Usually, the ASCII is a snapshot. The list is the source of truth for available apples. However, the ASCII `A` implies an apple exists there.\n        *   Let's assume the ASCII map is accurate for immediate visual context. The `A` at (5, 7) is definitely an apple.\n        *   The `A` at (6, 5) is listed and visible on the board (Row 5: `. A . . . . A . . A` -> (1,5) and (6,5) are apples).\n        *   The `A` at (6, 6) is listed and visible (Row 6: `. . . . . . A . . .` -> (6,6)).\n\n4.  **Move Evaluation (from Head at 3,7):**\n    *   **UP (3, 8):** This is occupied by my own body (the neck). **DEAD**. (Moving backwards is suicide).\n    *   **DOWN (3, 6):** Check board Row 6 (`y=6`). ` . . . . . . A . . . `.\n        *   (3, 6) is `.` (empty). **SAFE**.\n        *   **Pros:** Moves toward the apple at (6, 6). Moves away from the wall at y=9. Opens up movement to the left or right from y=6.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 7):** Check board Row 7 (`y=7`). ` . . . 1 . A . A A . `\n        *   (2, 7) is `.` (empty). **SAFE**.\n        *   **Pros:** Moves to the left side. Safe.\n        *   **Cons:** Moves away from the apple cluster at (5, 7), (6, 6), (5, 8).\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 7):** Check board Row 7 (`y=7`). ` . . . 1 . A . A A . `\n        *   (4, 7) is `.` (empty). **SAFE**.\n        *   **Pros:** Moves closer to the apple at (5, 7).\n        *   **Cons:** My body is at (3, 8) and (2, 8). Moving to (4, 7) is safe from immediate collision.\n\n5.  **Strategic Consideration:**\n    *   Enemy Snake 0 is at (5, 1). They are very far away. They are unlikely to intercept me in the next 2-3 turns unless they move purely vertically up, and even then, I have a lead.\n    *   My immediate goal is to eat apples safely.\n    *   **Target:** The apple at (5, 7) is adjacent to my current position (via RIGHT).\n    *   **Target:** The apple at (6, 6) is 2 moves away (DOWN then RIGHT).\n    *   **Target:** The apple at (5, 8) is 2 moves away (RIGHT then UP).\n    \n    *   **Safety of (4, 7):**\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (4, 7), I eat nothing immediately (no apple at 4,7). I can then move RIGHT to (5, 7) to eat an apple next turn.\n        *   From (4, 7), my body will be [(3, 7), (3, 8)].\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (5, 7) next, my body becomes [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)]. I eat the apple at (5, 7).\n    \n    *   **Safety of (3, 6):**\n        *   If I move DOWN to (3, 6), I move toward the cluster.\n        *   From (3, 6), I can move RIGHT to (4, 6), then (5, 6) or (6, 6).\n        *   The apple at (6, 6) is a good target.\n    \n    *   **Wall Awareness:**\n        *   I am currently at y=7. y=9 is the wall. y=8 is directly above me (occupied by my body).\n        *   Staying at y=8 or y=9 is dangerous because it limits retreat options. y=7 is a good \"buffer\" row.\n        *   Moving DOWN to y=6 opens up the bottom half of the board (y=0 to y=6).\n    \n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   Moving **DOWN** to (3, 6) seems the most flexible. It avoids the immediate wall trap at the top right. It heads towards (6, 6) which is a central apple.\n        *   Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 7) is also safe, but keeps me pinned near the top (y=7).\n        *   Let's look at the board again. The area around (4, 6) is `.`. The area around (4, 7) is `.`.\n        *   The apple at (6, 6) is surrounded by open space.\n        *   The apple at (5, 7) is closer, but puts me on row 7.\n        \n        *   **Comparison:**\n            *   **RIGHT (4, 7):** Approaches (5, 7). Next turn I can likely eat (5, 7). From there, I can go UP to (5, 8) (if still there) or DOWN to (5, 6).\n            *   **DOWN (3, 6):** Approaches (6, 6). Next turn I can move toward (6, 6). From (3, 6), I have access to the center of the board.\n        \n        *   **Safety Check for DOWN (3, 6):**\n            *   Is (3, 6) empty? Yes, board row 6 shows `.` at index 3.\n            *   Does it move me into a trap? No. (3, 6) is far from walls.\n            \n        *   **Safety Check for RIGHT (4, 7):**\n            *   Is (4, 7) empty? Yes, board row 7 shows `.` at index 4.\n            *   Does it move me into a trap? No. But I am closer to the right wall (x=9) and top wall (y=9).\n            \n        *   **Why DOWN is better:**\n            *   I am currently at y=7. y=8 is blocked by my body. y=9 is a wall. If I move RIGHT to (4, 7) and the enemy or a trap forces me up later, I am stuck.\n            *   Moving DOWN to (3, 6) gives me vertical freedom. I can move up to y=7 or y=8 later if needed, or stay low.\n            *   The apple at (6, 6) is a very safe apple. It is in the open.\n            *   The apple at (5, 7) is also safe, but (3, 6) is a safer *position* than (4, 7) because it's more central and away from the top-right corner dead end.\n            \n            *   Wait, looking at the apples list again: `(6, 6)`, `(5, 8)`, `(5, 7)`.\n            *   If I go DOWN to (3, 6), I am heading towards (6, 6).\n            *   If I go RIGHT to (4, 7), I am heading towards (5, 7).\n            \n            *   **Enemy Check:** Snake 0 is at (5, 1). They are irrelevant for this move.\n            \n            *   **The \"Dead End\" Risk:**\n                *   If I go RIGHT to (4, 7), I am on row 7. My body is at (3, 7) and (3, 8).\n                *   From (4, 7), if I go RIGHT to (5, 7), I eat an apple. My body becomes (4,7), (3,7), (3,8).\n                *   From (5, 7), if I go UP to (5, 8) (assuming apple is there), I eat.\n                *   However, if I go UP to (5, 8), I am at y=8. My body is at (5, 7) and (4, 7).\n                *   If I am at (5, 8), I am at the top row. The only escape is DOWN (into myself eventually) or LEFT (into myself eventually) or RIGHT (towards wall).\n                *   This is a classic Snake trap. Being on the top row is dangerous.\n            \n            *   **If I go DOWN to (3, 6):**\n                *   I am at y=6.\n                *   I can move to (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6).\n                *   I can move down to y=5.\n                *   I have significantly more room to maneuver.\n                \n            *   **Conclusion:** DOWN is the safer strategic choice to maintain board control and avoid the top wall trap.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:** Move DOWN to (3, 6). This positions me to collect the apple at (6, 6) or pivot to (5, 7) while maintaining a safe distance from the walls and my own body.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove down to (3, 6) to open up the lower board. Target the apple at (6, 6) or (5, 7) next. Avoid the top-right corner to prevent getting trapped by the walls. Maintain awareness of Snake #0, though they are currently far away.\n\nDOWN",

(5, 6) is `.` (empty). **SAFE**.\n\n3.  **Apple Strategy & Assessment:**\n    *   **Current Target:** The apple at (6, 6) was the previous target.\n    *   **Proximity:**\n        *   (5, 6) is adjacent to (6, 6).\n        *   (4, 7) is diagonal to (5, 7) and (6, 6).\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** Snake #0 is at (7, 1). It is currently moving away from the apple cluster (Row 6-8). It poses no immediate threat to my head or the apples at (6, 6), (5, 7), etc.\n    *   **Body Risk:** My body is at (3, 6) and (3, 7).\n        *   If I go **UP** to (4, 7), my tail will move from (3, 7) to (3, 6). The cell (4, 6) will become empty.\n        *   If I go **RIGHT** to (5, 6), my tail moves to (3, 6). The cell (3, 6) becomes empty, freeing up that space.\n        *   If I go **DOWN** to (4, 5), my tail moves to (3, 6). The cell (3, 6) becomes empty.\n\n4.  **Decision Logic:**\n    *   **LEFT** is fatal.\n    *   **UP (4, 7):** This is a strong move. It keeps me on Row 7, which is closer to the top wall but has multiple apples (5, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7). It also keeps the option open to move RIGHT to (5, 7) next turn (an apple). It avoids the immediate center cluster where the snake's own body is currently located.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 5):** Moves me to row 5. There is an apple at (5, 5) (Wait, checking map: Row 5 `. A . . . . A . . A`. x=5 is `.`, x=6 is `A`). (5, 5) is empty, but (6, 5) is an apple. (0, 3) is also down there. This is a valid path but moves away from the densest cluster.\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 6):** Moves me closer to the (6, 6) apple. However, this puts my head into the \"middle\" of the board where my own body was just located. While technically safe immediately, it feels slightly more crowded than moving UP to the clearer Row 7.\n\n    *   **Comparison UP vs RIGHT:**\n        *   **UP** moves to a row (Row 7) that currently has an apple at (5, 7) and (8, 7).\n        *   **RIGHT** moves to (5, 6), targeting (6, 6).\n        *   **Flexibility:** From (4, 7), I can go RIGHT to (5, 7) (Apple) or LEFT to (3, 7) (Body? No, body moves to 3,6. (3, 7) becomes empty). From (5, 6), I can go UP to (5, 7) (Apple) or RIGHT to (6, 6) (Apple).\n    *   **Final Choice:** **UP** to (4, 7). This move is safe, avoids the immediate path of my previous body, and positions me perfectly to eat the apple at (5, 7) next turn if I choose. It also keeps me further away from the slow-moving enemy snake just in case.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (4, 7). Next turn, move RIGHT to (5, 7) to eat the apple. After that, evaluate moving to (6, 6) or (6, 7) depending on new threats.\n\nUP",

No, checking the board state: `Row 7: 7 . . . . 1 A . A A A`. My head is at (4, 7) (empty). The apple is at (5, 7).\n    *   **Proximity:**\n        *   (5, 7) is an apple. Moving RIGHT gets it immediately.\n        *   (4, 8) is empty but has apples nearby at (5, 8) and (6, 8).\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** Snake #0 is at (7, 2). It is moving away. It does not threaten the apples at (5, 7) or (4, 8).\n    *   **Body Risk:**\n        *   If I go **RIGHT** to (5, 7), I eat the apple and grow. My tail will stay at (3, 6). The segment (4, 6) will become the new body part.\n        *   If I go **UP** to (4, 8), I do not eat. My tail moves to (4, 6).\n        *   If I go **LEFT** to (3, 7), I do not eat. My tail moves to (4, 6).\n\n4.  **Decision Logic:**\n    *   **DOWN** is fatal.\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 7):** This move grabs the apple immediately. It is a \"free\" point. After eating, my body will be [(4, 7), (4, 6), (3, 6)]. From (5, 7), I can move UP to (5, 8) (Apple), RIGHT to (6, 7) (Apple), or DOWN to (5, 6) (Empty). This offers excellent immediate reward and future options.\n    *   **UP (4, 8):** Moves closer to the cluster at (5, 8) and (6, 8). It is safe, but I leave an apple on the table right next to me.\n    *   **LEFT (3, 7):** Moves away from the dense apple cluster. Generally suboptimal compared to RIGHT or UP.\n\n    *   **Comparison:** Eating the apple at (5, 7) is the highest priority. It provides a score point and growth. Moving UP or LEFT delays this gain. Since RIGHT is safe and leads to an apple, it is the superior move.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 7) to eat the apple. Next turn, consider moving UP to (5, 8) to eat the apple there, or continue clearing the right side of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

Checking the board state, the `0` is at (7, 3), meaning it moved UP from (7, 2).

No, the apple is gone. The board shows `1` for my head).\n    *   **Row 6:** `. . . T T . A . . .` (Body at 4,6 and 3,6).\n    *   **Row 5:** `. A . . . . A . .

It is moving towards apples at (6, 3) and (6, 5). It is currently far from my head at (5, 7). There is no immediate threat of head-on collision (it would need to move 4 squares up and 2 squares right to meet me this turn, which is impossible).\n    *   **Apple Availability:**\n        *   **UP (5, 8):** Apple. This is a high-value target. Eating it gives +1 score and growth. It also positions me at y=8, opening up the top row.\n        *   **RIGHT (6, 7):** Apple. Also a high-value target. Eating it gives +1 score and growth.\n        *   **DOWN (5, 6):** Empty. Moves me toward a potential trap area (lower y-values) and away from the dense apple cluster at the top right.\n    *   **Future Planning:**\n        *   If I move **UP to (5, 8)**:\n            *   I eat the apple.\n            *   Next turn, I can move UP to (5, 9), LEFT to (4, 8), or RIGHT to (6, 8) (another apple).\n            *   This path looks open and leads to the top edge.\n        *   If I move **RIGHT to (6, 7)**:\n            *   I eat the apple.\n            *   Next turn, I can move UP to (6, 8) (apple), RIGHT to (7, 7) (apple), or DOWN to (6, 6) (apple).\n            *   This path is also very rich in apples.\n        *   If I move **DOWN to (5, 6)**:\n            *   I do not eat.\n            *   I move closer to the enemy (which is at y=3). This might be useful to cut it off, but currently, the apples are up.\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   Both UP and RIGHT are safe and lead to apples.\n        *   UP to (5, 8) feels slightly safer because it moves away from the board center and the enemy's current general area (East). It also clears a path to the top boundary.\n        *   However, RIGHT to (6, 7) offers immediate consumption and opens a path to (6, 8) and (7, 7).\n        *   Looking at the density: (5,8), (6,8), (7,7), (8,7) are a tight cluster. (6,7) is the \"entry point\" to this cluster from the East.\n        *   (5,8) is the entry point from the South. Moving to (5,8) allows access to (5,9) and (6,8).\n        *   Let's verify board boundaries. (5,9) is top edge. (6,9) is top edge.\n        *   Let's look at the apple list: (9,4), (6,6), (8,9), (9,5), (8,4), (5,8), (7,7), (6,3), (6,8), (1,5), (6,5), (0,3), (8,7), (9,7), (1,4).\n        *   There is an apple at (8,9) (top right corner).\n        *   There is an apple at (9,7) and (9,5).\n        *   Moving UP to (5,8) seems like a good pivot to the top-left side of the top cluster.\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (6,7) keeps me in the center.\n        *   I will choose **UP**. It is safe, eats an apple, and positions me to access the top row and the (6,8) apple next turn.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (5, 8) to eat the apple. From there, next turn I can target the apple at (6, 8) or (5, 9), keeping me on the top edge away from the enemy in the bottom right.\n\nUP",

My body has grown to: [(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (3, 6)].\n\n**Analysis for Turn 13:**\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at **(5, 8)**.\n2.  **Board State:**\n    *   Row 8: `. . . . . 1 A . . .`\n    *   Row 7: `. . . . T T . A A A`\n    *   Row 9: `9 . . . . . . . . . .` (Top edge is open).\n3.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   **UP to (5, 9):** Valid board coordinate. It is currently empty (no snake bodies or obstacles shown). Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (5, 7):** My own body segment (immediately behind head). **DEADLY**.\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 8):** Valid board coordinate. Check board state: Row 8 shows a dot at index 4. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 8):** Valid board coordinate. Row 8 shows an Apple at index 6. Safe (and eats apple).\n4.  **Enemy Analysis (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head at (6, 3), Body trailing to (5, 1).\n    *   Distance to my head is 5 vertical + 0 horizontal = 5 moves. This is a safe distance for this turn, but the enemy may head towards the upper board if apples move there.\n    *   My primary competitors for the apples in the top right (7,7), (6,8), (8,9) are... only myself. The enemy is far away.\n5.  **Strategy:**\n    *   I am currently at (5, 8).\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 8)** is a strong move because it eats an apple immediately.\n    *   **UP to (5, 9)** moves to the top edge. From there, I can move RIGHT to (6, 9) or (6, 8) next turn.\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 8)** moves away from the apple cluster at (6,8) and (7,7).\n    *   Looking ahead, the dense apple cluster is at (6,8), (7,7), (8,7). Moving RIGHT to (6,8) puts me directly into this cluster.\n    *   From (6, 8), next turn I can move RIGHT to (7, 8) or UP to (6, 9) or DOWN to (6, 7). This keeps options open.\n    *   If I go UP to (5, 9), I am on the top edge, which limits movement to DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. While safe, it delays accessing the apple at (6, 8).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (6, 8) is the optimal move. It secures an apple point immediately and positions my head right in the center of a rich apple patch (neighbors (7,7), (8,7), (5,8) all have apples), maximizing future scoring potential.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (6, 8). From there, I will likely move towards (7, 7) or (8, 7) to continue accumulating points. I must maintain distance from Snake #0, but currently, the top-right sector is mine to dominate.\n\nRIGHT",

My body consists of segments at (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (3, 6). I have 5 apples. Enemy Snake #0 (6 apples) is located at (6, 4) with a body trailing downwards. The board is 10x10.\n2.  **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 is at (6, 4). With a body length of 7 (including head), it currently occupies (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1). This snake has shown vertical movement previously (moving from (6, 2) to (6, 3) or similar, though the last move was reported as RIGHT, it seems to be maneuvering in the lower section). I am at (6, 8). There are no apples directly between us (apple at (6, 5) and (6, 6) are open). Snake #0 is 4 units away vertically. If it moves UP, it moves towards the cluster of apples I am targeting. If it stays put or moves away, I have room. Given its low apple count (6 vs my 5), it is likely foraging. I am \"above\" it. I have the high ground and the apples. I will maintain position but remain alert.\n3.  **Board State & Apples:**\n    *   My immediate vicinity: (6, 8) is my head. The apple at (6, 8) is gone (eaten last turn).\n    *   Adjacent cells:\n        *   **UP (6, 9):** Occupied by Snake #0's body segment (based on the board map `[5, 9]` or the text description of the board state). The board map explicitly shows `T` at (6, 9). **DEADLY.**\n        *   **DOWN (6, 7):** Currently occupied by my own body (segment (5, 8) moved to (6, 8), so (5, 8) is now free? No. My body is [(5, 8), (5, 7)...]. Wait, looking at the board map:\n            *   Row 8: `. . A . . T 1 . . .` (Index 6 is '1', my head).\n            *   Row 7: `. . . . T T . A A A`.\n            *   The map shows `T` (tail/obstacle) at (5, 7) and (5, 6)? Actually, looking at the textual body: `(5, 8), (5, 7)`.\n            *   The board map at (6, 7) is `.` (empty).\n            *   However, my body length is 6. Head (6,8) -> (5,8) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (4,6) -> (3,6).\n            *   If I move DOWN to (6, 7), I need to check if (6, 7) is in my body. My body is at (5,8), (5,7), (4,7), (4,6), (3,6). (6,7) is NOT in my body. It is safe.\n            *   *Correction*: The board map shows `T` at (5, 8) and (5, 7). It shows `.` at (6, 7).\n        *   **LEFT (5, 8):** This is the cell I just vacated. It will be free *unless* I move into it and it is technically a collision with \"moving backwards\"? No, moving backwards is strictly into the cell directly behind the head. If I move LEFT, I go to (5, 8). The cell *behind* the head (relative to the move) would be (7, 8) (which doesn't exist relative to my body). The rule \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\" applies if (5, 8) was the tail immediately connected. It is. If I move LEFT, I move into my own body (the neck). **DEADLY.**\n        *   **RIGHT (7, 8):** Empty (`. ` on map). Safe.\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   **UP (6, 9):** Blocked by Snake #0's body. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **LEFT (5, 8):** My own body (the neck). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **DOWN (6, 7):** Empty. Safe. Leads towards the apple at (7, 7) or (6, 6).\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 8):** Empty. Safe. Leads towards apples at (7, 7) and (8, 7).\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Moving DOWN to (6, 7) aligns with the apple at (7, 7) (requires LEFT next turn). It also brings me closer to (6, 6).\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (7, 8) aligns directly with the apple at (8, 7) (requires DOWN-LEFT or DOWN-DOWN-LEFT). It also aligns with (7, 7) (requires DOWN).\n        *   **Crucial Observation:** Snake #0 is at (6, 4). Its vertical reach is potentially 3-4 moves. The apple at (6, 6) is \"in the middle\" between us. The apple at (7, 7) is to my RIGHT/DOWN.\n        *   By moving RIGHT to (7, 8), I am moving *away* from Snake #0's vertical column (x=6). This gives me space. If I stay at x=6, I risk a direct collision if Snake #0 rushes up. Moving to x=7 creates separation.\n        *   From (7, 8), I can go DOWN to (7, 7) (apple) or LEFT to (6, 8) (empty) or UP to (7, 9) (empty, top edge).\n        *   From (6, 7), I am still on the same x-axis as Snake #0.\n    *   **Safety:** Both (7, 8) and (6, 7) are safe for this turn.\n    *   **Strategy:** Maintain distance from the enemy snake. The enemy is at x=6. Moving to x=7 increases the Manhattan distance between my head and the enemy head. Since the board is small, separating axes is vital.\n    *   **Apple Targeting:** The cluster (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) is to the right. Moving RIGHT positions me to sweep this cluster.\n    *   **Long-term Plan:** From (7, 8), I will target the apple at (7, 7) or (8, 7). I will watch the enemy snake. If it moves UP, I will likely need to keep moving RIGHT/DOWN to outmaneuver it in the corner.\n\n**Decision:** Move **RIGHT** to (7, 8). This maximizes safety by separating from the enemy's x-axis and aligns with the dense apple cluster on the right side of the board.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Based on the board state and the analysis of potential moves, here is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Current State Analysis**:\n    *   My head is at $(7, 8)$.\n    *   My body occupies $(6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6)$.\n    *   Enemy Snake #0 is at $(6, 5)$ with a body stretching downwards.\n    *   Apples are abundant at $(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7)$ and $(8, 9), (9, 9)$.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Moves from $(7, 8)$**:\n    *   **UP to $(7, 9)$**: This is empty (based on the board map) and within bounds. It moves towards the top-right apples. However, from $(7, 9)$, I would be on the top edge, limiting future moves (only Down, Left, Right available next turn).\n    *   **DOWN to $(7, 7)$**: This contains an apple! Moving here eats the apple, grows my body, and scores a point. From $(7, 7)$, I have access to $(8, 7)$ (apple), $(7, 8)$ (empty), $(6, 7)$ (empty), and $(7, 6)$ (empty). This is a central, high-value position.\n    *   **LEFT to $(6, 8)$**: This is my own body segment. **DEADLY**. (Note: Even if the tail moved, the neck is typically occupied or moving backwards is prohibited/fatal. The body list confirms it is occupied).\n    *   **RIGHT to $(8, 8)$**: This is empty. It moves me closer to the cluster. However, it does not eat an apple immediately.\n\n3.  **Comparing Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT)**:\n    *   **DOWN to $(7, 7)$** is the most advantageous because:\n        *   It scores a point immediately (Apple at 7,7).\n        *   It increases my length, which is crucial for survival and blocking the enemy.\n        *   It positions me centrally relative to the high-density apple cluster $(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (8,9), (9,9)$.\n        *   From $(7, 7)$, I can easily transition to $(8, 7)$ or $(7, 6)$ next turn.\n    *   **Enemy Safety**: The enemy is at $(6, 5)$. Even if they move UP to $(6, 6)$, they are far from my destination $(7, 7)$. There is no immediate head-on collision risk.\n    *   **Trapping Risk**: Moving to $(7, 7)$ does not trap me. I have ample open space to the right and up.\n\n4.  **Long-term Strategy**: Secure the apple at $(7, 7)$ to close the score gap (Enemy has 7, I have 5). Then, sweep the cluster at $(8, 7), (9, 7)$ before moving up to $(8, 9), (9, 9)$. This keeps my x-coordinate $> 6$, maintaining separation from the enemy's column.\n\n**Decision**: Move DOWN to $(7, 7)$ to eat the apple and position optimally for the next turn.\n\nDOWN",

Going UP to (6,6) keeps you distant from their current head and prioritizes a quick apple gain next to your position. It also avoids stepping into any area that could become a trap if they shift toward your vicinity.\n\nPlan:\n- Take the apple now to extend your lead while preserving space to maneuver.\n- After this move, monitor the enemy's chosen path. If they head toward high-value apples (e.g., (7,7) or (8,7) or (9,4)), adjust to maintain safe distances and avoid creating potential cross-paths or dead-ends.\n\nUP",

Apples: 8.\n*   **Board:** I am at (7, 7). My body extends to (7, 8) (up), (6, 8) (up-left), (5, 8) (left), (5, 7) (down-left), (4, 7) (left), (4, 6) (down). The immediate cell (7, 8) is occupied by my neck.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n*   **UP to (7, 8):** This is my body segment. **DEADLY.**\n*   **LEFT to (6, 7):** Empty space.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 7):** **Apple.**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 6):** Empty space.\n\n**Risk Assessment (Enemy at 6,6):**\n*   The enemy is at (6, 6), diagonally adjacent to my head at (7, 7).\n*   **Head-on Collision:** If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 6) and I move DOWN to (7, 6), we collide.\n*   **Squeezing:** If I move RIGHT to (8, 7), I narrow the gap between my body (at 7,8) and the enemy. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 6), the cell (7, 7) will be empty, but I will be at (8, 7). The risk of the enemy trapping me later is higher if I don't establish a buffer.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nI have two good options: RIGHT and DOWN.\n1.  **RIGHT (8, 7):** Eats an apple (score 7), grows my body. This moves me away from the enemy at (6, 6), increasing the x-distance. It keeps me in the cluster of apples. From (8, 7), I have access to (9, 7), (8, 8), (8, 6). This is a strong offensive move to secure points.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 6):** Does not eat an apple. Keeps me at distance from the enemy. From (7, 6), I can access (6, 6) if the enemy moves (but risky), (8, 6), (7, 5). This is a safer, conservative move.\n\n**Decision:**\nI need to close the score gap (I have 6, Enemy has 8). Eating the apple at (8, 7) is crucial. Moving RIGHT also maintains a vertical distance from the enemy's head (y=6 vs my y=7). The collision risk (Enemy moving RIGHT to 7,6 while I move to 8,7) is non-existent. The only risk is if the enemy moves UP to (6, 7), which is empty, but that keeps them away. Moving RIGHT is the most valuable move that maintains safety.\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to eat the apple at (8, 7). From there, plan to move to (9, 7) next turn to eat another apple and isolate myself in the top-right corner.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Currently safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 7):** **Apple.** Leads to top-right corner.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 6):** Empty space.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 7):** My own tail. I would die.\n\n**Risk Assessment (Enemy at 6,7):**\n*   The enemy is at (6, 7), one step left of my previous position (7, 7).\n*   **Head-on Collision:**\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (9, 7), I am safe from direct collision as the enemy cannot reach that in one step.\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 7), they move into my tail (which is safe for them, but might shorten my body).\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 7), it's impossible because I am currently there.\n    *   **Critical Risk:** If the enemy moves UP to (6, 8), they might collide with my body. My body goes (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 8) -> (6, 8). If the enemy moves to (6, 8), they hit my body segment at (6, 8) and die. This is highly advantageous.\n    *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 6), they are safe but retreating.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nI need to close the score gap (7 vs 8).\n1.  **RIGHT (9, 7):** Eats an apple (score 8). Moves me to the edge of the board (x=9). From (9, 7), my only forward move will likely be UP to (9, 8) or DOWN to (9, 6). This is a risky \"corner\" move, but the immediate apple is vital. It also moves me further away from the enemy's potential path.\n2.  **UP (8, 8):** Safe, opens up the top row (9, 8).\n3.  **DOWN (8, 6):** Safe, moves closer to the center but keeps options open.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe apple at (9, 7) is right there. Taking it increases my score to 8, tying with the enemy. While moving to the edge limits my future moves, I must take points when available to avoid falling too far behind. If I don't take it, the enemy might eventually get a path to it or simply outscore me. From (9, 7), I will be able to move UP to (9, 8) next turn, which is also an apple. I will be trapping myself in the corner, but with two apples to eat, it's worth the risk to catch up.\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to (9, 7) to eat the apple. Next turn, move UP to (9, 8) to eat the next apple. This will establish a \"holding pattern\" in the top right corner.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",
