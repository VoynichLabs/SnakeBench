I can reach this in one move by going **DOWN**.\n2. **Enemy Snake**: Snake #0 is currently positioned at `(9, 4)`. It's directly next to the apple at `(8, 4)`, which means it might try to go for the same apple. However, the enemy snake is already to the **right** side of the apple, so I have a slight positional advantage to collect this one first by stepping directly **DOWN** before it gets close.\n3. **Future Strategy**: After getting the apple at `(8, 4)`, I need to plan my next moves.

I can reach this in one move by going **DOWN**.\n2. **Enemy Snake**: Snake #0 is currently positioned at `(9, 4)`.

This is an optimal move.\n     - Moving LEFT to `(4, 6)` is **valid and safe**. No immediate obstacles are present to the left. My body or walls are not in this direction.\n   - **DOWN**:\n     - Moving down to `(5, 5)` would collide with my previous body segment and result in instant defeat. Therefore, **DOWN is not safe**.\n   - **RIGHT**:\n     - Moving RIGHT to `(6, 6)` would collide with another segment of my body, so this is also **not safe**.\n   - **UP**:\n     - Moving UP to `(5, 7)` increases the distance to `(4, 3)`. This move works against my current goal. Although it is safe since no obstacles are there, it is counterproductive. Avoid this move.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - The enemy snake (#0) is at `(8, 8)` and has a single body segment. They are far away from both my snake and any apples that I am targeting. For now, I do not expect them to interfere with my pursuit of the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n\n5. **Strategy Overview**:\n   - My priority this turn is to move closer to `(4, 3)` in the most direct and efficient way while avoiding collisions.\n   - Moving LEFT to `(4, 6)` is the best option because:\n     - It reduces the x-coordinate by 1, aligning with the x-coordinate of `(4, 3)`.\n     - It keeps me far away from my body and any potential hazards.\n   - I will plan my next steps based on my updated position after moving LEFT. I anticipate needing to move **DOWN** after reaching `(4, 6)`.\n\n#### Prediction After This Move:\n1. My new head position will be `(4, 6)`.\n2. My body will adjust to `[(5, 6), (6, 6)]`, with the tail being `(6, 6)`.\n3. I will be 3 steps away from `(4, 3)`, and the next strongest move will likely be **DOWN** if the path remains clear.\n\n---\n\n### My Decision: **LEFT**"

Here's the breakdown of the steps to get there:\n     - **X-coordinate Match**: My current x-coordinate is already `4`, which matches the x-coordinate of the apple at `(4, 3)`.

The closest apple is still at `(4, 3)`, so my goal is to continue moving toward it.\n\n#### Goal Analysis:\n1. **Apple Target**: Apple at `(4, 3)`  \n   - My current x-coordinate (`4`) matches the apple's x-coordinate.  \n   - My current y-coordinate (`5`) requires two **DOWN** moves to align with the y-coordinate of the apple at `3`.  \n   - Since I'm already vertically aligned with the apple, I'll continue moving downward safely.\n\n#### Safe Moves Analysis:\n1. **Evaluate Each Direction**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take me to `(4, 6)`, which is literally moving backward into my own body. This would result in death. Avoid this move.  \n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take me to `(3, 5)`, away from the apple and unnecessarily increasing the distance to my goal. While this is \"safe\" in terms of obstacles, it would slow my progress. Avoid this move.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take me to `(5, 5)`, putting me in the incorrect horizontal direction (away from the apple) and also closer to my own tail. This is not helpful to reaching the apple. Avoid this move.  \n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take me to `(4, 4)`, progressing me closer to the apple at `(4, 3)`. There are no obstacles (snake body, walls, or enemy snakes) along this path. This is the most optimal and safe move.  \n\n#### Opponent and Map Analysis:\n1. **Enemy Snakes**:\n   - The enemy snake (#0) is still at `(6, 8)` with a body segment at `(7, 8)`. It remains far away from both me and the apple at `(4, 3)`. The enemy snake does not pose any immediate threat.  \n2. **Hazards and Obstacles**:\n   - There are no hazards or obstacles between me and the apple at `(4, 3)`. My path continuing **DOWN** is clear.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Overview**:\n1. My strategy remains straightforward: continue moving **DOWN** toward the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n2. There will still be one more **DOWN** move required after this turn to collect the apple.  \n\n---\n\n### **Prediction After the Move**:\n1. My new head position will be `(4, 4)`.  \n2. My snake's body will adjust to `[(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]`, with the tail moving to `(4, 6)`.  \n3. After this move, I will be one step away from collecting the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Note for Next Turn**:\nUnless conditions change (e.g., an enemy snake moves closer or another opportunity arises), I will aim to move **DOWN** next turn as well to collect the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n\n---\n\n### **My Decision: DOWN**"

The closest apple remains at `(4, 3)`. Here's the breakdown of the steps to get there:\n     - **X-coordinate Match**: My current x-coordinate is already `4`, which matches the x-coordinate of the apple at `(4, 3)`.

I should consider **RIGHT** to close the gap and align with the target x-coordinate.\n   - **Y-Coordinate Adjustment**: My current y-coordinate (`4`) is 1 greater than the apple's y-coordinate (`3`).

There are five apples on the board, and I need to plan how to eat them efficiently.\n\n#### Key Observations:\n1. **Nearest Apple**: The closest apple to me is at `(8, 4)` (one unit directly down). I can reach this in one move by going **DOWN**.\n2. **Enemy Snake**: Snake #0 is currently positioned at `(9, 4)`. It's directly next to the apple at `(8, 4)`, which means it might try to go for the same apple. However, the enemy snake is already to the **right** side of the apple, so I have a slight positional advantage to collect this one first by stepping directly **DOWN** before it gets close.\n3. **Future Strategy**: After getting the apple at `(8, 4)`, I need to plan my next moves. I should consider my next target apple while avoiding collisions with Snake #0. The apples at `(7, 6)` and `(9, 1)` are good options to pursue after this initial apple.\n\n#### Risk Assessment:\n- Moving **DOWN** is safe since there's no obstacle or snake in the way.\n- Snake #0 is unlikely to interfere immediately because it will likely go for the apples on its side of the map or move away.\n\n#### Decision Plan for Next Turn:\n- My next immediate move will be to go **DOWN** to `(8, 4)` and secure the point.\n- Once I get the apple, I'll assess whether to move toward the apple at `(7, 6)` (next closest) or make a strategic shift to another target.\n\n### My Next Move:\n**DOWN**"

I need three steps **DOWN** to reach the y-coordinate `3`.\n\n3. **Safe Moves**:\n   - Now that my x-coordinate is correct, I don\u2019t need to move LEFT or RIGHT anymore. I can focus solely on moving DOWN to align with the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n   - Let\u2019s evaluate each direction carefully:\n     - **LEFT**:\n       - Moving LEFT would move me to `(3, 6)`, which increases the distance to the apple. While it is safe, it\u2019s unnecessary and counterproductive. Avoid this move.\n     - **DOWN**:\n       - Moving DOWN to `(4, 5)` is a safe move, as there are no obstacles or hazards in my path. It also progresses toward the apple at `(4, 3)`, making this the most optimal direction.\n     - **RIGHT**:\n       - Moving RIGHT to `(5, 6)` would result in a collision with my snake\u2019s own body. This is **not safe**.\n     - **UP**:\n       - Moving UP to `(4, 7)` works against my goal by increasing the distance to the apple. While this move is safe, it\u2019s counterproductive.\n\n4. **Opponent and Map Analysis**:\n   - The enemy snake (#0) is at `(8, 8)` with a body segment at `(8, 8)`. They are far away from both my snake and the apple at `(4, 3)`. They pose no immediate threat to me or my ability to reach my target.\n   - No walls, other snakes, or hazards obstruct the path between my snake and the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Overview:**\n1. My most efficient strategy is to move **DOWN** one step at a time toward the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n2. After this move, my new head position will be `(4, 5)`, and I will adjust my plan to continue moving DOWN until I collect the apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Prediction After the Move**:\n1. My new head position will be `(4, 5)`.\n2. My body will adjust to `[(4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]`, with the tail being `(5, 6)`.\n3. I will be two steps away from the apple at `(4, 3)`, with my expected next move still being **DOWN** unless something changes.\n\n---\n\n### **My Decision: DOWN**"

The closest apple is still at `(4, 3)`, so my goal is to continue moving toward it.\n\n#### Goal Analysis:\n1. **Apple Target**: Apple at `(4, 3)`  \n   - My current x-coordinate (`4`) matches the apple's x-coordinate.  \n   - My current y-coordinate (`5`) requires two **DOWN** moves to align with the y-coordinate of the apple at `3`.  \n   - Since I'm already vertically aligned with the apple, I'll continue moving downward safely.\n\n#### Safe Moves Analysis:\n1. **Evaluate Each Direction**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take me to `(4, 6)`, which is literally moving backward into my own body. This would result in death. Avoid this move.  \n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take me to `(3, 5)`, away from the apple and unnecessarily increasing the distance to my goal. While this is \"safe\" in terms of obstacles, it would slow my progress. Avoid this move.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take me to `(5, 5)`, putting me in the incorrect horizontal direction (away from the apple) and also closer to my own tail. This is not helpful to reaching the apple. Avoid this move.  \n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take me to `(4, 4)`, progressing me closer to the apple at `(4, 3)`. There are no obstacles (snake body, walls, or enemy snakes) along this path. This is the most optimal and safe move.  \n\n#### Opponent and Map Analysis:\n1. **Enemy Snakes**:\n   - The enemy snake (#0) is still at `(6, 8)` with a body segment at `(7, 8)`. It remains far away from both me and the apple at `(4, 3)`. The enemy snake does not pose any immediate threat.  \n2. **Hazards and Obstacles**:\n   - There are no hazards or obstacles between me and the apple at `(4, 3)`. My path continuing **DOWN** is clear.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Overview**:\n1. My strategy remains straightforward: continue moving **DOWN** toward the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n2. There will still be one more **DOWN** move required after this turn to collect the apple.  \n\n---\n\n### **Prediction After the Move**:\n1. My new head position will be `(4, 4)`.  \n2.

I should consider **RIGHT** to close the gap and align with the target x-coordinate.\n   - **Y-Coordinate Adjustment**: My current y-coordinate (`4`) is 1 greater than the apple's y-coordinate (`3`).

The closest apple is still at `(4, 3)`, so my goal is to continue moving toward it.\n\n#### Goal Analysis:\n1. **Apple Target**: Apple at `(4, 3)`  \n   - My current x-coordinate (`4`) matches the apple's x-coordinate.  \n   - My current y-coordinate (`5`) requires two **DOWN** moves to align with the y-coordinate of the apple at `3`.  \n   - Since I'm already vertically aligned with the apple, I'll continue moving downward safely.\n\n#### Safe Moves Analysis:\n1. **Evaluate Each Direction**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take me to `(4, 6)`, which is literally moving backward into my own body. This would result in death. Avoid this move.  \n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take me to `(3, 5)`, away from the apple and unnecessarily increasing the distance to my goal. While this is \"safe\" in terms of obstacles, it would slow my progress. Avoid this move.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take me to `(5, 5)`, putting me in the incorrect horizontal direction (away from the apple) and also closer to my own tail. This is not helpful to reaching the apple. Avoid this move.  \n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take me to `(4, 4)`, progressing me closer to the apple at `(4, 3)`. There are no obstacles (snake body, walls, or enemy snakes) along this path. This is the most optimal and safe move.  \n\n#### Opponent and Map Analysis:\n1. **Enemy Snakes**:\n   - The enemy snake (#0) is still at `(6, 8)` with a body segment at `(7, 8)`. It remains far away from both me and the apple at `(4, 3)`. The enemy snake does not pose any immediate threat.  \n2. **Hazards and Obstacles**:\n   - There are no hazards or obstacles between me and the apple at `(4, 3)`. My path continuing **DOWN** is clear.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Overview**:\n1. My strategy remains straightforward: continue moving **DOWN** toward the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n2. There will still be one more **DOWN** move required after this turn to collect the apple.  \n\n---\n\n### **Prediction After the Move**:\n1. My new head position will be `(4, 4)`.  \n2. My snake's body will adjust to `[(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]`, with the tail moving to `(4, 6)`.  \n3. After this move, I will be one step away from collecting the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Note for Next Turn**:\nUnless conditions change (e.g., an enemy snake moves closer or another opportunity arises), I will aim to move **DOWN** next turn as well to collect the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n\n---\n\n### **My Decision: DOWN**"

I should consider **RIGHT** to close the gap and align with the target x-coordinate.\n   - **Y-Coordinate Adjustment**: My current y-coordinate (`4`) is 1 greater than the apple's y-coordinate (`3`). A **DOWN** move would be required but should be reserved for the following turn, once I am horizontally aligned with the x-coordinate.\n\n2. **Enemy Snakes and Hazards**:  \n   - Analyzing enemy snake #0:\n     * They are far away at `(5, 8)`, and their body segments at `(6, 8)` and `(7, 8)` do not interfere with my path.  \n     * No immediate danger or competition for the closest apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n   - The rest of the board contains no walls, other bodies, or immediate obstacles between me and the apple.  \n\n3. **Direction Analysis**:  \n   - **UP**: Moving UP to `(3, 5)` would cause me to run directly into my own body. This would result in death. Avoid.\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT to `(2, 4)` would move me farther from the target apple at `(4, 3)`. This would unnecessarily delay progress. Avoid.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT to `(4, 4)` aligns me with the x-coordinate of the apple at `(4, 3)`. This is an optimal move.  \n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN to `(3, 3)` would reduce my y-coordinate correctly but leave me misaligned with the target x-coordinate. Also not optimal for the path to the apple.  \n\n---\n\n### **Planned Move and Rationale:**\n1. My optimal move this turn is **RIGHT** to `(4, 4)`.  \n   - This aligns me with the x-coordinate of the apple.\n   - The path remains safe with no obstacles or threats.\n   - Once aligned horizontally, I can move **DOWN** next turn to collect the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n\n#### **Predicted Outcome of Move:**\n- My new head position: `(4, 4)`.  \n- My body positions: `[(4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)]`.  \n- No collisions or danger.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Notes for Next Turn:**\n1. If there are no changes to the board or threats, I will plan to move **DOWN** next turn to collect the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n2. Continue observing enemy snake #0 for potential interaction, though they are far from my current location for now.\n\n---\n\n### **My Decision: RIGHT**"

I should consider **RIGHT** to close the gap and align with the target x-coordinate.\n   - **Y-Coordinate Adjustment**: My current y-coordinate (`4`) is 1 greater than the apple's y-coordinate (`3`).

This would result in death. Avoid.\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT to `(2, 4)` would move me farther from the target apple at `(4, 3)`. This would unnecessarily delay progress. Avoid.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT to `(4, 4)` aligns me with the x-coordinate of the apple at `(4, 3)`.

My optimal move this turn is **RIGHT** to `(4, 4)`.  \n   - This aligns me with the x-coordinate of the apple.\n   - The path remains safe with no obstacles or threats.\n   - Once aligned horizontally, I can move **DOWN** next turn to collect the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n\n#### **Predicted Outcome of Move:**\n- My new head position: `(4, 4)`.  \n- My body positions: `[(4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)]`.  \n- No collisions or danger.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Notes for Next Turn:**\n1.

However, moving toward it will involve decreasing my X-coordinate and navigating through my body. Strategic planning and careful movement will be required.\n\n- **`(8, 0)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 8| + |3 - 0| = 5 + 3 = 8`  \n   - Far, no major obstacles nearby but takes longer to reach.\n\n- **`(2, 6)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 2| + |3 - 6| = 1 + 3 = 4`  \n   - Relatively close. This apple seems like the best target because it\u2019s quick to reach, minimizes risk, and doesn\u2019t require navigating through a tight area around my body.\n\n- **`(5, 7)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 5| + |3 - 7| = 2 + 4 = 6`  \n   - Medium distance, but moving toward this apple requires heading upward and competing with Snake #0, whose body is at `(4, 8)` and `(5, 8)`.\n\n#### **Optimal Apple Target: `(2, 6)`**\nGiven the proximity and lack of immediate threats, targeting the apple at `(2, 6)` is the best choice.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Plan Path Toward `(2, 6)`**\n1. **Current Heading:**  \n   - My snake's head is at `(3, 3)` facing **LEFT** from the last move.\n\n2. **Immediate Move Options:**  \n   - **UP (`(3, 4)`):** Enters my body. Illegal.  \n   - **DOWN (`(3, 2)`):** Clear and legal.  \n   - **LEFT (`(2, 3)`):** Acceptable and moves toward the `(2, 6)` apple.  \n   - **RIGHT (`(4, 3)`):** My own body is there. Illegal.\n\n3. **Safest Option:**  \n   Moving **LEFT to `(2, 3)`** both progresses me toward the target apple `(2, 6)` safely and avoids any potential hazards.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turns**\n1.

It is closer to the apple at `(9, 1)` than any other apples, so I expect it to move toward that apple.\n   - It\u2019s unlikely to contest the apple at `(7, 6)`, nor does it pose a threat for this turn.\n\n4. **Obstacles**:\n   - No walls or other snakes currently blocking the most direct path to `(7, 6)`.\n   - My own body behind me `(8, 4)` means no DOWN moves are available.\n\n---\n\n#### Plan:\n1. The most direct path to the target apple `(7, 6)` is to go **UP**.\n   - This moves me from `(7, 4)` to `(7, 5)` and sets me up for reaching `(7, 6)` on the following turn by moving **UP** again.\n2.

The closest apple is still at `(4, 3)`, so my goal is to continue moving toward it.\n\n#### Goal Analysis:\n1. **Apple Target**: Apple at `(4, 3)`  \n   - My current x-coordinate (`4`) matches the apple's x-coordinate.  \n   - My current y-coordinate (`5`) requires two **DOWN** moves to align with the y-coordinate of the apple at `3`.  \n   - Since I'm already vertically aligned with the apple, I'll continue moving downward safely.\n\n#### Safe Moves Analysis:\n1. **Evaluate Each Direction**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take me to `(4, 6)`, which is literally moving backward into my own body. This would result in death. Avoid this move.  \n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take me to `(3, 5)`, away from the apple and unnecessarily increasing the distance to my goal. While this is \"safe\" in terms of obstacles, it would slow my progress. Avoid this move.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take me to `(5, 5)`, putting me in the incorrect horizontal direction (away from the apple) and also closer to my own tail. This is not helpful to reaching the apple. Avoid this move.  \n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take me to `(4, 4)`, progressing me closer to the apple at `(4, 3)`. There are no obstacles (snake body, walls, or enemy snakes) along this path. This is the most optimal and safe move.  \n\n#### Opponent and Map Analysis:\n1. **Enemy Snakes**:\n   - The enemy snake (#0) is still at `(6, 8)` with a body segment at `(7, 8)`. It remains far away from both me and the apple at `(4, 3)`. The enemy snake does not pose any immediate threat.  \n2. **Hazards and Obstacles**:\n   - There are no hazards or obstacles between me and the apple at `(4, 3)`. My path continuing **DOWN** is clear.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Overview**:\n1. My strategy remains straightforward: continue moving **DOWN** toward the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n2. There will still be one more **DOWN** move required after this turn to collect the apple.  \n\n---\n\n### **Prediction After the Move**:\n1. My new head position will be `(4, 4)`.  \n2. My snake's body will adjust to `[(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]`, with the tail moving to `(4, 6)`.  \n3. After this move, I will be one step away from collecting the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Note for Next Turn**:\nUnless conditions change (e.g., an enemy snake moves closer or another opportunity arises), I will aim to move **DOWN** next turn as well to collect the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n\n---\n\n### **My Decision: DOWN**"

I should consider **RIGHT** to close the gap and align with the target x-coordinate.\n   - **Y-Coordinate Adjustment**: My current y-coordinate (`4`) is 1 greater than the apple's y-coordinate (`3`). A **DOWN** move would be required but should be reserved for the following turn, once I am horizontally aligned with the x-coordinate.\n\n2. **Enemy Snakes and Hazards**:  \n   - Analyzing enemy snake #0:\n     * They are far away at `(5, 8)`, and their body segments at `(6, 8)` and `(7, 8)` do not interfere with my path.  \n     * No immediate danger or competition for the closest apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n   - The rest of the board contains no walls, other bodies, or immediate obstacles between me and the apple.  \n\n3. **Direction Analysis**:  \n   - **UP**: Moving UP to `(3, 5)` would cause me to run directly into my own body. This would result in death. Avoid.\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT to `(2, 4)` would move me farther from the target apple at `(4, 3)`. This would unnecessarily delay progress. Avoid.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT to `(4, 4)` aligns me with the x-coordinate of the apple at `(4, 3)`.

Also not optimal for the path to the apple.  \n\n---\n\n### **Planned Move and Rationale:**\n1. My optimal move this turn is **RIGHT** to `(4, 4)`.  \n   - This aligns me with the x-coordinate of the apple.\n   - The path remains safe with no obstacles or threats.\n   - Once aligned horizontally, I can move **DOWN** next turn to collect the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n\n#### **Predicted Outcome of Move:**\n- My new head position: `(4, 4)`.  \n- My body positions: `[(4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)]`.  \n- No collisions or danger.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Notes for Next Turn:**\n1. If there are no changes to the board or threats, I will plan to move **DOWN** next turn to collect the apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n2.

Let me evaluate the apples:\n\n- **`(9, 1)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 9| + |3 - 1| = 6 + 2 = 8`  \n   - Very far to the right, but path is relatively open. It's not my nearest target.\n\n- **`(0, 5)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 0| + |3 - 5| = 3 + 2 = 5`  \n   - Closest apple. However, moving toward it will involve decreasing my X-coordinate and navigating through my body. Strategic planning and careful movement will be required.\n\n- **`(8, 0)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 8| + |3 - 0| = 5 + 3 = 8`  \n   - Far, no major obstacles nearby but takes longer to reach.\n\n- **`(2, 6)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 2| + |3 - 6| = 1 + 3 = 4`  \n   - Relatively close. This apple seems like the best target because it\u2019s quick to reach, minimizes risk, and doesn\u2019t require navigating through a tight area around my body.\n\n- **`(5, 7)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 5| + |3 - 7| = 2 + 4 = 6`  \n   - Medium distance, but moving toward this apple requires heading upward and competing with Snake #0, whose body is at `(4, 8)` and `(5, 8)`.\n\n#### **Optimal Apple Target: `(2, 6)`**\nGiven the proximity and lack of immediate threats, targeting the apple at `(2, 6)` is the best choice.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Plan Path Toward `(2, 6)`**\n1. **Current Heading:**  \n   - My snake's head is at `(3, 3)` facing **LEFT** from the last move.\n\n2. **Immediate Move Options:**  \n   - **UP (`(3, 4)`):** Enters my body. Illegal.  \n   - **DOWN (`(3, 2)`):** Clear and legal.  \n   - **LEFT (`(2, 3)`):** Acceptable and moves toward the `(2, 6)` apple.  \n   - **RIGHT (`(4, 3)`):** My own body is there.

I can reach this in one move by going **DOWN**.\n2. **Enemy Snake**: Snake #0 is currently positioned at `(9, 4)`. It's directly next to the apple at `(8, 4)`, which means it might try to go for the same apple.

Avoid this move.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - The enemy snake (#0) is at `(8, 8)` and has a single body segment. They are far away from both my snake and any apples that I am targeting. For now, I do not expect them to interfere with my pursuit of the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n\n5. **Strategy Overview**:\n   - My priority this turn is to move closer to `(4, 3)` in the most direct and efficient way while avoiding collisions.\n   - Moving LEFT to `(4, 6)` is the best option because:\n     - It reduces the x-coordinate by 1, aligning with the x-coordinate of `(4, 3)`.\n     - It keeps me far away from my body and any potential hazards.\n   - I will plan my next steps based on my updated position after moving LEFT. I anticipate needing to move **DOWN** after reaching `(4, 6)`.\n\n#### Prediction After This Move:\n1. My new head position will be `(4, 6)`.\n2. My body will adjust to `[(5, 6), (6, 6)]`, with the tail being `(6, 6)`.\n3. I will be 3 steps away from `(4, 3)`, and the next strongest move will likely be **DOWN** if the path remains clear.\n\n---\n\n### My Decision: **LEFT**"

The closest apple remains at `(4, 3)`. Here's the breakdown of the steps to get there:\n     - **X-coordinate Match**: My current x-coordinate is already `4`, which matches the x-coordinate of the apple at `(4, 3)`. No further motion is needed horizontally.\n     - **Y-coordinate Alignment**: My current y-coordinate is `6`. I need three steps **DOWN** to reach the y-coordinate `3`.\n\n3. **Safe Moves**:\n   - Now that my x-coordinate is correct, I don\u2019t need to move LEFT or RIGHT anymore. I can focus solely on moving DOWN to align with the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n   - Let\u2019s evaluate each direction carefully:\n     - **LEFT**:\n       - Moving LEFT would move me to `(3, 6)`, which increases the distance to the apple.

It also progresses toward the apple at `(4, 3)`, making this the most optimal direction.\n     - **RIGHT**:\n       - Moving RIGHT to `(5, 6)` would result in a collision with my snake\u2019s own body. This is **not safe**.\n     - **UP**:\n       - Moving UP to `(4, 7)` works against my goal by increasing the distance to the apple.

Illegal.\n\n3. **Safest Option:**  \n   Moving **LEFT to `(2, 3)`** both progresses me toward the target apple `(2, 6)` safely and avoids any potential hazards.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turns**\n1. Evaluate Snake #0's position if heading toward `(2, 6)` aligns us toward its zone. Be prepared to detour.\n2. Once close to `(2, 6)`, navigate thoughtfully to avoid head-on collisions with Snake #0 while keeping safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Move**: **LEFT**"

I should consider **RIGHT** to close the gap and align with the target x-coordinate.\n   - **Y-Coordinate Adjustment**: My current y-coordinate (`4`) is 1 greater than the apple's y-coordinate (`3`). A **DOWN** move would be required but should be reserved for the following turn, once I am horizontally aligned with the x-coordinate.\n\n2. **Enemy Snakes and Hazards**:  \n   - Analyzing enemy snake #0:\n     * They are far away at `(5, 8)`, and their body segments at `(6, 8)` and `(7, 8)` do not interfere with my path.  \n     * No immediate danger or competition for the closest apple at `(4, 3)`.  \n   - The rest of the board contains no walls, other bodies, or immediate obstacles between me and the apple.  \n\n3. **Direction Analysis**:  \n   - **UP**: Moving UP to `(3, 5)` would cause me to run directly into my own body. This would result in death. Avoid.\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT to `(2, 4)` would move me farther from the target apple at `(4, 3)`. This would unnecessarily delay progress.

Let me evaluate the apples:\n\n- **`(9, 1)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 9| + |3 - 1| = 6 + 2 = 8`  \n   - Very far to the right, but path is relatively open. It's not my nearest target.\n\n- **`(0, 5)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 0| + |3 - 5| = 3 + 2 = 5`  \n   - Closest apple. However, moving toward it will involve decreasing my X-coordinate and navigating through my body. Strategic planning and careful movement will be required.\n\n- **`(8, 0)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 8| + |3 - 0| = 5 + 3 = 8`  \n   - Far, no major obstacles nearby but takes longer to reach.\n\n- **`(2, 6)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 2| + |3 - 6| = 1 + 3 = 4`  \n   - Relatively close. This apple seems like the best target because it\u2019s quick to reach, minimizes risk, and doesn\u2019t require navigating through a tight area around my body.\n\n- **`(5, 7)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 5| + |3 - 7| = 2 + 4 = 6`  \n   - Medium distance, but moving toward this apple requires heading upward and competing with Snake #0, whose body is at `(4, 8)` and `(5, 8)`.\n\n#### **Optimal Apple Target: `(2, 6)`**\nGiven the proximity and lack of immediate threats, targeting the apple at `(2, 6)` is the best choice.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Plan Path Toward `(2, 6)`**\n1. **Current Heading:**  \n   - My snake's head is at `(3, 3)` facing **LEFT** from the last move.\n\n2. **Immediate Move Options:**  \n   - **UP (`(3, 4)`):** Enters my body. Illegal.  \n   - **DOWN (`(3, 2)`):** Clear and legal.  \n   - **LEFT (`(2, 3)`):** Acceptable and moves toward the `(2, 6)` apple.  \n   - **RIGHT (`(4, 3)`):** My own body is there. Illegal.\n\n3. **Safest Option:**  \n   Moving **LEFT to `(2, 3)`** both progresses me toward the target apple `(2, 6)` safely and avoids any potential hazards.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turns**\n1. Evaluate Snake #0's position if heading toward `(2, 6)` aligns us toward its zone. Be prepared to detour.\n2. Once close to `(2, 6)`, navigate thoughtfully to avoid head-on collisions with Snake #0 while keeping safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Move**: **LEFT**"

This is an optimal move.\n     - Moving LEFT to `(4, 6)` is **valid and safe**. No immediate obstacles are present to the left. My body or walls are not in this direction.\n   - **DOWN**:\n     - Moving down to `(5, 5)` would collide with my previous body segment and result in instant defeat. Therefore, **DOWN is not safe**.\n   - **RIGHT**:\n     - Moving RIGHT to `(6, 6)` would collide with another segment of my body, so this is also **not safe**.\n   - **UP**:\n     - Moving UP to `(5, 7)` increases the distance to `(4, 3)`. This move works against my current goal. Although it is safe since no obstacles are there, it is counterproductive. Avoid this move.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - The enemy snake (#0) is at `(8, 8)` and has a single body segment. They are far away from both my snake and any apples that I am targeting. For now, I do not expect them to interfere with my pursuit of the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n\n5. **Strategy Overview**:\n   - My priority this turn is to move closer to `(4, 3)` in the most direct and efficient way while avoiding collisions.\n   - Moving LEFT to `(4, 6)` is the best option because:\n     - It reduces the x-coordinate by 1, aligning with the x-coordinate of `(4, 3)`.\n     - It keeps me far away from my body and any potential hazards.\n   - I will plan my next steps based on my updated position after moving LEFT. I anticipate needing to move **DOWN** after reaching `(4, 6)`.\n\n#### Prediction After This Move:\n1. My new head position will be `(4, 6)`.\n2. My body will adjust to `[(5, 6), (6, 6)]`, with the tail being `(6, 6)`.\n3. I will be 3 steps away from `(4, 3)`, and the next strongest move will likely be **DOWN** if the path remains clear.\n\n---\n\n### My Decision: **LEFT**"

The closest apple remains at `(4, 3)`. Here's the breakdown of the steps to get there:\n     - **X-coordinate Match**: My current x-coordinate is already `4`, which matches the x-coordinate of the apple at `(4, 3)`. No further motion is needed horizontally.\n     - **Y-coordinate Alignment**: My current y-coordinate is `6`.

I can focus solely on moving DOWN to align with the apple at `(4, 3)`.\n   - Let\u2019s evaluate each direction carefully:\n     - **LEFT**:\n       - Moving LEFT would move me to `(3, 6)`, which increases the distance to the apple.

It also progresses toward the apple at `(4, 3)`, making this the most optimal direction.\n     - **RIGHT**:\n       - Moving RIGHT to `(5, 6)` would result in a collision with my snake\u2019s own body. This is **not safe**.\n     - **UP**:\n       - Moving UP to `(4, 7)` works against my goal by increasing the distance to the apple.

I should consider **RIGHT** to close the gap and align with the target x-coordinate.\n   - **Y-Coordinate Adjustment**: My current y-coordinate (`4`) is 1 greater than the apple's y-coordinate (`3`).

Strategic planning and careful movement will be required.\n\n- **`(8, 0)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 8| + |3 - 0| = 5 + 3 = 8`  \n   - Far, no major obstacles nearby but takes longer to reach.\n\n- **`(2, 6)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 2| + |3 - 6| = 1 + 3 = 4`  \n   - Relatively close. This apple seems like the best target because it\u2019s quick to reach, minimizes risk, and doesn\u2019t require navigating through a tight area around my body.\n\n- **`(5, 7)`**  \n   - Distance: `|3 - 5| + |3 - 7| = 2 + 4 = 6`  \n   - Medium distance, but moving toward this apple requires heading upward and competing with Snake #0, whose body is at `(4, 8)` and `(5, 8)`.\n\n#### **Optimal Apple Target: `(2, 6)`**\nGiven the proximity and lack of immediate threats, targeting the apple at `(2, 6)` is the best choice.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Plan Path Toward `(2, 6)`**\n1. **Current Heading:**  \n   - My snake's head is at `(3, 3)` facing **LEFT** from the last move.\n\n2. **Immediate Move Options:**  \n   - **UP (`(3, 4)`):** Enters my body. Illegal.  \n   - **DOWN (`(3, 2)`):** Clear and legal.  \n   - **LEFT (`(2, 3)`):** Acceptable and moves toward the `(2, 6)` apple.  \n   - **RIGHT (`(4, 3)`):** My own body is there. Illegal.\n\n3. **Safest Option:**  \n   Moving **LEFT to `(2, 3)`** both progresses me toward the target apple `(2, 6)` safely and avoids any potential hazards.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turns**\n1. Evaluate Snake #0's position if heading toward `(2, 6)` aligns us toward its zone. Be prepared to detour.\n2. Once close to `(2, 6)`, navigate thoughtfully to avoid head-on collisions with Snake #0 while keeping safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Move**: **LEFT**"

From there, depending on the situation, moving **UP** or **STRAIGHT UP** will lead me closer to the apple safely.\n\n---\n\n### **Immediate Decision**\n\nThe safest, most efficient, and logical move right now is **LEFT** to `(2, 3)`.\n\n### **Move:** **LEFT**"
