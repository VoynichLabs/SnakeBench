I have no body segments.\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 5).\n\nApples are at: (9, 5), (2, 0), (9, 6), (6, 5), (2, 4).\n\nMy current position is the top edge (y=9).\n\n**1. Evaluate potential moves (Safety Check):**\n\nMy head is at $H_0 = (4, 9)$. My body is empty, so no risk of hitting myself immediately, except moving off the board or into the enemy head. The cell behind me is irrelevant since I have no body.\n\n*   **UP:** (4, 10). This is off the board (y > 9). **Dead.**\n*   **DOWN:** (4, 8). This is safe on the board.\n*   **LEFT:** (3, 9). This is safe on the board.\n*   **RIGHT:** (5, 9). This is safe on the board.\n\nSafe moves remaining: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Check for collisions with Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n\nEnemy head $H_1 = (3, 5)$. The enemy body is empty.\n\nWe need to predict where $H_1$ moves. Since I don't know the enemy's strategy, I must evaluate my possible moves against all possible moves of $H_1$.\n\nPossible moves for $H_1$: (3, 6) UP, (3, 4) DOWN, (2, 5) LEFT, (4, 5) RIGHT.\n\n*   **If I move DOWN to (4, 8):**\n    *   Possible $H_1$ destinations: (3, 6), (3, 4), (2, 5), (4, 5). None collide with (4, 8). Safe relative to $H_1$.\n\n*   **If I move LEFT to (3, 9):**\n    *   Possible $H_1$ destinations: (3, 6), (3, 4), (2, 5), (4, 5). None collide with (3, 9). Safe relative to $H_1$.\n\n*   **If I move RIGHT to (5, 9):**\n    *   Possible $H_1$ destinations: (3, 6), (3, 4), (2, 5), (4, 5). None collide with (5, 9). Safe relative to $H_1$.\n\nNo immediate mutual head-on collisions are guaranteed, as my 3 options do not overlap with any of the enemy's 4 potential destinations.\n\n**3. Evaluate Goal (Apple Proximity and Strategy):**\n\nApples: A1(9, 5), A2(2, 0), A3(9, 6), A4(6, 5), A5(2, 4).\n\nMy head is at (4, 9). I need to move down to reach any apples.\n\n*   **Distance Checks (Manhattan distance to apples):**\n    *   To A1(9, 5): |9-4| + |5-9| = 5 + 4 = 9\n    *   To A2(2, 0): |2-4| + |0-9| = 2 + 9 = 11\n    *   To A3(9, 6): |9-4| + |6-9| = 5 + 3 = 8\n    *   To A4(6, 5): |6-4| + |5-9| = 2 + 4 = 6\n    *   To A5(2, 4): |2-4| + |4-9| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nThe closest apple is A4 at (6, 5), distance 6.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (4, 8):** Reduces vertical distance to all apples by 1. Moves me towards the center/bottom relatively fast. Distance to A4 becomes 5. This is generally a good positioning move since I am currently stuck at the top edge.\n*   **Move LEFT to (3, 9):** Moves me closer to A5 (2, 4) (if I can then go down immediately). Distance to A4 becomes 5 horizontally, 4 vertically. Total 9 (Worse than distance 6 if I moved down).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (5, 9):** Moves me closer to A4 (6, 5). Distance to A4 becomes 4 horizontally, 4 vertically. Total 8.\n\nComparing the closest options to A4 (6, 5):\n1. DOWN to (4, 8): Distance to (6, 5) is 2 right, 3 down. Total 5 steps remaining.\n2. RIGHT to (5, 9): Distance to (6, 5) is 1 right, 4 down. Total 5 steps remaining.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT put me 5 steps away from the nearest apple A4(6, 5).\n\nHowever, I am currently at y=9. I *must* move down eventually to get apples. Moving DOWN (4, 8) immediately commits to moving towards the middle/bottom of the board and breaks the top edge constraint. Moving RIGHT (5, 9) keeps me high up, which limits future movement flexibility relative to the board edges later compared to moving down immediately.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 5). If I move RIGHT to (5, 9), the enemy could potentially move towards me (e.g., RIGHT to (4, 5)) or move towards central apples.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 8), I immediately improve my position relative to the entire field of apples. A move towards the center seems strategically superior to shuffling along the top edge when the game is very early (Turn 0).\n\nLet's anticipate the enemy's response to DOWN (4, 8). $H_1$ might target A5(2, 4) or A2(2, 0) or pathfind towards the middle apples A4(6, 5). If $H_1$ moves UP to (3, 6), it is trying to climb. If $H_1$ moves RIGHT to (4, 5), it gets closer to A4.\n\nMoving DOWN seems the most constructive play to escape the boundary and begin closing the distance to the closest apples (starting with A4 at distance 6).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Move towards the closest available apple (6, 5). Since I am currently constrained by the top wall, prioritize moving down at the first safe opportunity.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN.\n\n**4. Final Check:**\nMove DOWN to (4, 8).\n*   Off board? No.\n*   Into own body? No (no body yet).\n*   Into enemy body? No, $H_1$ cannot reach (4, 8) in one move.\n*   Head-on collision? No, as analyzed above, none of $H_1$'s possible next locations is (4, 8).\n\nSafe and strategically sound.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy snake is at (4, 9), the top edge. I must move down to access the apples located lower on the board. The closest apple is (6, 5). Moving DOWN to (4, 8) reduces the distance to the closest apples and breaks the constraint of the top wall, preserving maximum future options compared to moving laterally along the top edge. All moves appear safe from immediate collision.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

Distance to A4 becomes 2 steps closer (4 remaining). This seems like the best directional commitment.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (5, 8):** Moves 1 step closer to the target X coordinate. Distance to A4 becomes 4 remaining (1 left, 3 down). 4 steps remaining. This is slightly better distance-wise than DOWN (4 remaining).\n*   **Move LEFT to (3, 8):** Moves 1 step further from the target X coordinate. Distance to A4 becomes 6 remaining (3 left, 3 down). Poor commitment.\n*   **Move UP to (4, 9):** Moves 1 step further away from the target Y coordinate. Distance to A4 becomes 7 remaining (2 right, 4 down). Poor commitment.\n\nComparing RIGHT (to (5, 8), distance to A4 = 4) vs DOWN (to (4, 7), distance to A4 = 4):\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 8): I am still very high up (y=8). If the enemy moves towards A4 (which is plausible, as H1 is at (3, 5), distance to A4 is 3), they might contest this area quickly. If H1 moves RIGHT to (4, 5), they are very close to A4.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 7): I am descending towards the central apples. $H_1$ is at (3, 5). My new position (4, 7) is slightly above and to the right of $H_1$.\n\nLet's look at $H_1$'s likely response if I go RIGHT to (5, 8).\n$H_1$ options towards A4(6, 5) are RIGHT to (4, 5) or UP to (3, 6).\nIf $H_1$ moves RIGHT to (4, 5), it steals the optimal path towards A4, setting up a sequence like: Me (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 5). Enemy (4, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (6, 5). They are faster if I commit to RIGHT too early.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 7).\n$H_1$ options: (3, 6), (3, 4), (2, 5), (4, 5).\nIf $H_1$ moves DOWN to (3, 4), it starts moving towards A2(2, 0) or A5(2, 4).\nIf $H_1$ moves RIGHT to (4, 5) -- This is the only move where $H_1$ gets closer to A4(6, 5) AND threatens collision with me if I try to go too aggressively DOWN next turn.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT to (5, 8), I have a distance of 4 to A4.\nIf I choose DOWN to (4, 7), I have a distance of 4 to A4.\n\nSince A4 is currently reachable via the shortest path (5 steps), and both RIGHT and DOWN keep me on that minimum path, I should prioritize vertical movement to clear the high board space unless RIGHT offers a clear immediate advantage or better safety margin. Moving DOWN establishes a better downward trajectory toward the cluster of apples A4(6, 5), A1(9, 5), A3(9, 6).\n\nConsider the vertical trajectory:\nIf RIGHT to (5, 8): Next move could be DOWN to (5, 7) (distance 3 to A4).\nIf DOWN to (4, 7): Next move could be RIGHT to (5, 7) (distance 3 to A4), or DOWN to (4, 6) (distance 4 to A4).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 8), I am setting up a future move to (5, 7).\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 7), I am setting up a future move to (4, 6) or (5, 7).\n\nThe state (5, 7) is 1 step closer to A4 than (4, 7) or (5, 8) relative to the X axis.\nMy current location (4, 8) is 2 units left of A4's X coordinate (6). Going RIGHT speeds up closing that X gap.\n\nLet's re-check enemy movements relative to my potential locations.\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 8). $H_1$ might move to (4, 5). We are moving somewhat parallel on different Y levels.\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 7). $H_1$ might move to (4, 5). This creates potential conflict near (4, 5) and (4, 6)/(4, 7).\n\nSince I am aiming for (6, 5), getting to (5, 8) via RIGHT seems slightly more aggressive towards the X component needed, without immediately sacrificing vertical progress. It lands me one grid cell closer to the X target (6) in one move.\n\nLet's stick with the move maximizing progress towards the closest target coordinates. A4=(6, 5). Current=(4, 8). Need +2X, -3Y.\nDOWN gives -1Y. Offset: +2X, -2Y remaining.\nRIGHT gives +1X. Offset: +1X, -3Y remaining.\n\nIf I take RIGHT: (5, 8). Next step, I'd ideally take RIGHT again to (6, 8) or DOWN to (5, 7). If I go RIGHT again to (6, 8), an enemy move to (4, 5) or (3, 6) keeps them away.\n\nIf I take DOWN: (4, 7). Next step, I'd ideally take RIGHT to (5, 7) or DOWN to (4, 6). If I go RIGHT to (5, 7), an enemy move to (4, 5) or (3, 6) or (3, 4).\n\nMoving RIGHT (5, 8) sets up a better intermediate alignment to cut across towards (6, 5) using a rightward drift while descending. This seems marginally superior to just pushing straight down while still being far off horizontally.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue moving towards the closest apple (6, 5) using the path that maximizes horizontal progress while descending. Avoid commitment to the lower left cluster (A2, A5) until the central apples are handled or the enemy focuses there.\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy head is at (4, 8). The closest apple is A4 at (6, 5). To reach it optimally, I need to move +2 in X and -3 in Y. Moving RIGHT to (5, 8) accomplishes +1X, securing horizontal progress that is necessary to approach A4 efficiently, while still maintaining a safe downward trajectory relative to the board center. All moves are safe.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

So $H_1$ options are: (2, 3), (1, 4), (3, 4).\n\nCheck $H_0$ destinations against $H_1$ current state and possible next states:\n\n*   **H0 -> (5, 9) [UP]:**\n    *   Vs $H_1(2, 4)$: Safe.\n    *   Vs $B_1(2, 5)$: Safe.\n    *   Vs $H_1$ future positions ((2, 3), (1, 4), (3, 4)): Safe.\n*   **H0 -> (5, 7) [DOWN]:**\n    *   Vs $H_1(2, 4)$: Safe.\n    *   Vs $B_1(2, 5)$: Safe.\n    *   Vs $H_1$ future positions: Safe.\n*   **H0 -> (6, 8) [RIGHT]:**\n    *   Vs $H_1(2, 4)$: Safe.\n    *   Vs $B_1(2, 5)$: Safe.\n    *   Vs $H_1$ future positions: Safe.\n\nAll three remaining moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe from Snake #1 colliding with us this turn.\n\nNow check if $H_1$ might move into our body segment at (4, 8) or (5, 8).\n$H_0$ next positions: (5, 9), (5, 7), (6, 8).\n$B_0$ next segments: [(5, 8), (4, 8)].\n\n$H_1$ possible moves: (2, 3), (1, 4), (3, 4). None of these hit (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 7), or (6, 8). Snake 1 is far away.\n\n**3. Evaluate Goal (Apple Proximity and Strategy):**\nCurrent Head $H_0 = (5, 8)$. Body $B_0 = [(4, 8)]$.\nApples: A1(9, 5), A2(2, 0), A3(9, 6), A4(6, 5), A5(1, 2).\n\nDistances from (5, 8):\n*   A1(9, 5): |9-5| + |5-8| = 4 + 3 = 7\n*   A2(2, 0): |2-5| + |0-8| = 3 + 8 = 11\n*   A3(9, 6): |9-5| + |6-8| = 4 + 2 = 6\n*   A4(6, 5): |6-5| + |5-8| = 1 + 3 = 4 **(Closest)**\n*   A5(1, 2): |1-5| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nA4(6, 5) is the target. We need +1X, -3Y.\n\n*   **Move UP to (5, 9):** Increases Y distance. Distance to A4 is 5 (1X, 4Y). This moves away from the target Y dimension.\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 7):** Decreases Y distance by 1. Distance to A4 is 3 (1X, 2Y). **Optimal move towards A4.**\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 8):** Decreases X distance by 1. Distance to A4 is 3 (0X, 3Y). This reaches the target X coordinate!\n\nComparing DOWN (5, 7) -> distance 3 vs RIGHT (6, 8) -> distance 3.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (6, 8)**: I have hit the target X coordinate (6). Next move I can focus purely on Y. This is highly aligned with the target A4(6, 5).\nIf I then move DOWN to (6, 7) next turn, distance to A4 is 2 (0X, 2Y).\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (5, 7)**: Next move I would ideally move RIGHT to (6, 7) to align X, bringing distance to A4 to 2 (0X, 2Y).\n\nBoth moves lead to a distance of 2 to A4 in two moves. However, if Snake 1 moves aggressively towards A4, being X-aligned is often safer or more advantageous for claiming territory. Snake 1 is at (2, 4). It is unlikely to reach A4 (6, 5) quickly, especially since it consumed a body segment last turn, meaning it needs 2 moves just to get to (4, 4) if moving aggressively right/down.\n\nSince RIGHT to (6, 8) resolves the X coordinate immediately, I will choose RIGHT, as it positions me well for the final vertical approach to A4.\n\n**Enemy Counterplay Check for RIGHT (6, 8):**\n$H_1$ options: (2, 3), (1, 4), (3, 4).\nIf $H_1$ moves to (3, 4), it is still far. Next turn, if I go DOWN to (6, 7), distance 2. $H_1$ might move to (4, 4) or (3, 3).\n\nThis choice maximizes direct progress towards the closest critical objective (A4).\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE to future self:** Primary goal is tracking A4(6, 5). Continue descending towards it. Avoid collisions with H1, which seems focused on the lower-left quadrant or maneuvering near its current position. Since the body is small (Head (5,8), Body (4,8)), being aggressive towards apples is fine now.\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nThe closest apple is A4(6, 5). My current location (5, 8) requires +1X and -3Y to reach it. Moving RIGHT to (6, 8) immediately satisfies the X requirement (distance to A4 becomes 3, specifically 0X, 3Y deficit). This sets up a clear descent path towards A4 on the next turn, potentially securing the apple fastest. This move is safe from self-collision (cannot move back to (4, 8)) and enemy collision.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Enemy Body $B_1 = [(1, 3), (2, 3)]$.\nSnake 1 is currently at (1, 2). Nearest apples are A0(2, 0) and A2(1, 2) is EATEN (oops, (1, 2) is $H_1$ now, not an apple). The apples are A0(2, 0) and A2(1, 2) is NOT an apple in the current list: (9, 5), (2, 0), (9, 6), (6, 5) [Just eaten], (5, 9).\nThe nearest apple for Snake 1 is A0(2, 0). Snake 1 needs to move DOWN to (2, 1) or (1, 1) if it zigzags.\n\nAnticipating Snake 1's move:\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (1, 1): Still far from (6, 6).\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (0, 2): Still far.\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 2): Still far.\n\nNo risk of immediate collision.\n\n**3. Evaluate Goal (Apple Proximity and Strategy):**\nThe move DOWN leads directly to eating Apple A4 at (6, 5). This is the highest priority action as it consolidates the lead on the nearest resource, immediately increases body size (providing safety buffer), and scores a point.\n\n**Move DOWN.**\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** Eat A4 at (6, 5). Next targets: A0(9, 5) or A3(9, 6). Both require significant eastward travel. After eating (6, 5), the snake will be long enough to perhaps start building walls or safe paths if resources become scarce, but for now, direct pursuit of apples (Eastward) is best.\n\nMove

Evaluate Goal (Apple Proximity and Strategy):**\nWe just ate (6, 5).\nRemaining Apples: A0(9, 5), A2(9, 6), A4(5, 9).\nThe closest remaining apples are Eastward: (9, 5) [Distance 3] and (9, 6) [Distance $\\sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16$].\nOur current position is (6, 5).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 4):** Distance to future targets: (9, 5) becomes distance 4 (3X, 1Y deficit). (9, 6) becomes distance $\\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.6$. This moves away from the east. **Not optimal.**\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 5):** Distance to nearest targets: (9, 5) becomes 4 (4X, 0Y deficit). (9, 6) becomes $\\sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.12$. This moves sideways.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 5):** Distance to nearest targets: (9, 5) becomes 2 (2X, 0Y deficit). (9, 6) becomes $\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$. This is the best move to set up a rapid approach towards apples (9, 5) and (9, 6).\n\nMoving RIGHT sets us up perfectly for two steps Eastward towards the cluster of apples at X=9.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** Move RIGHT towards (9, 5) and (9, 6). Then reassess. We must maintain safety, especially regarding the edges of the board, but for now, aggressive pursuit of the eastern apples after eating (6, 5) is the priority.\n\nThe move RIGHT minimizes Manhattan distance to the closest remaining apples.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Wait, the last rationale stated the *last* move was DOWN, leading to (6, 6) becoming the head *before* calculating Turn 7. I need to use the state *before* calculating the move for the current turn 7.)\n\nRereading the input:\nThe input shows information about **Turn 6**, which just finished.\n**Your last move information:**\nThe move chosen for Turn 6 was **DOWN**.\nThe rationale provided for Turn 6 indicates:\nOld Head (Turn 5): (7, 6). Old Body: none. Apples: 0. (This contradicts the Board State provided for T6 header).\n\nLet's establish the state *entering* Turn 7, based on the *Board State provided at the beginning of the Turn 6 block*, which seems to be the state *before* Turn 6 executed, or perhaps a corrupted intermediate state representation.\n\n**State provided at the very top (Turn 6 / 150):**\nHead: (7, 6). Body: none. Apples: 0.\nApples at: (9, 5), (2, 0), (9, 6), (6, 5), (5, 9)\nSnake #1 Head: (2, 2). Body: [(1, 2), (1, 3)]. Apples: 2.\nBoard visualization confirms Snake 0 (0) at (7, 6) and Snake 1 (1) at (2, 2).\n\n**Movement chosen for Turn 6:** RIGHT (from the last move pick shown for T6).\n*If the initial state was (7, 6):* Move RIGHT -> New Head (8, 6). Body extends, tail stays put (no growth unless apple eaten).\n*If the initial state was (7, 6) and the last move choice was RIGHT:*\nNew Head $H_{T6} = (8, 6)$. Body $B_{T6} = [(7, 6)]$. (If length 1, no body is listed, so the new body is [(7, 6)] if we assume initial length 1).\n\nHowever, the subsequent \"Last Rationale\" block describes a *different* state and move for Turn 6, implying the game state advanced significantly between the initial snapshot and the rationale block provided right before the decision point for the *next* move.\n\n**State implied by the *Last Rationale* block (which leads into the current decision point):**\nTurn preceding current one must have been Turn 6 execution.\nLast Move Chosen (for the completed turn): DOWN.\nHead *after* that move (i.e., Head entering the current state evaluation): (6, 6).\nSnake 0 Body/Length: [(6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8)]. (Length 5, Apples 0). Wait, the rationale says: \"Your snake (ID 0): Head: (6, 7), Body: [(6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8)], Apples collected: 0\".\nThen it says: **\"Your last move information: ... DOWN\"**\nThis means the snake moved DOWN from (6, 7) to (6, 6). And since NO apple was eaten in that move (the rationale implies a path to (6, 5) but lands on (6, 6)), the tail moved.\n$H_{T6} = (6, 6)$.\n$B_{T6} = [(6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8)]$. (Tail (4, 8) has moved out).\n\n**Enemy State entering turn 7 (based on T6 Rationale):**\nSnake #1 Head: (1, 2). Body: [(1, 3), (2, 3)]. Apples: 2. (This seems consistent with the first snapshot).\n\n**Board State reflecting the state *after* Turn 6 execution and *before* Turn 7 decision:**\n(This implies Snake 0 moved from (6, 7) to (6, 6).

A . . . . . . .\nThis map does NOT match the map shown later in the T6 rationale block, which showed 0 at (6, 7) UPON ENTERING T6.\n\n**Crucial Assumption:** I must base my decision for T7 on the final state derived from the last implemented move (DOWN) *as described in the final rationale block*, even if the initial Board State snapshot seems inconsistent with how the game progressed.\n\n**State entering Turn 7 (Head moves from location dictated by $H_{T6}$):**\n1. **Last Move executed:** DOWN, from $H_{T5}$.\n2. **State BEFORE Last Move (T5 End):** Head=(6, 7), Body=[(6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8)].\n3. **State AFTER Last Move (T6 End, entering T7 decision):**\n   New Head $H_0 = (6, 6)$. (Since $Y$ decreased by 1, $7 \\to 6$).\n   Since no apple was eaten at (6, 6) (Apple A4 is at (6, 5)), the tail segment (4, 8) is removed.\n   $B_0 = [(6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8)]$. (Snake length 4).\n\n4. **Apples Remaining for T7:** (9, 5), (2, 0), (9, 6), (5, 9). (Apple A4 at (6, 5) remains).\n5. **Enemy Snake #1:** Head $H_1 = (1, 2)$. Body $B_1 = [(1, 3), (2, 3)]$. Apples: 2.\n\n**GOAL:** Move towards (6, 5) immediately.\n\n**Safety Check (From $H_0 = (6, 6)$):** Body is [(6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8)]. Tail is (5, 8).\n*   **UP (6, 7):** Collision with body segment (6, 7). **DEAD MOVE.**\n*   **DOWN (6, 5):** Eats Apple A4! Snake grows. Safe.\n*   **LEFT (5, 6):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 6):** Safe.\n\n**Evaluation:** Moving DOWN to (6, 5) eats the apple and scores a point, immediately increasing body length and thus safety margin. This is the highest priority action.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 1 at (1, 2)):** Needs 2 steps down to reach (2, 0). If it prioritizes safety or exploration, it might move elsewhere. Given we are far away, we prioritize scoring.\n\n**Strategy:** Eat the nearest apple (6, 5).\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** Eat (6, 5). Then proceed East towards (9, 5) and (9, 6).\n\nThe move must be DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Safe move, increases length. **GOAL MOVE.**\n3. **LEFT to (5, 6):** Safe move.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Safe move.\n\n**Enemy Movement Consideration (Snake 1 from (1, 2)):**\nSnake 1 is far away. It is likely heading toward the apple at (2, 0) or potentially trying to grow. Given its position, it cannot reach me, nor can I reach it in one move.\n\n**Decision:** The move DOWN leads directly to eating the nearest accessible apple, (6, 5). This is the optimal move. If I eat the apple, my new head will be (6, 5), and my new body will be $[(6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8)]$. My tail remains (5, 8) but it will not be removed until the next turn (since I grew).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** After eating (6, 5), my snake will be length 5, positioned at (6, 5). The next closest apples are (9, 5) and (9, 6). I should plan a route navigating towards the upper right corner to collect those two apples sequentially. This requires moving RIGHT or potentially moving UP to (6, 7) only after clearing position (6, 7) of my own body. Since (6, 7) is currently occupied by my body, I cannot move UP next turn unless I eat another apple *this* turn which would push the body segments down. Since I will eat an apple this turn, the body segments shift:\nNew Body if ate: [(6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8)]. My old tail (5, 8) remains, and the snake length increases by one. Old second-to-last segment (6, 8) becomes the new tail segment that *would* have moved out if no apple was eaten. Since an apple was eaten, the new tail is still the old tail (5, 8). Wait, if growing, the old tail segment stays, and the body extends.\nIf current body is $B = [S_1, S_2, ..., S_{L-1}, S_L]$ and head $H$, eating an apple results in $B_{new} = [H_{new}, S_1, S_2, ..., S_L]$.\nOld state: $H=(6, 6)$, $B=[(6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8)]$. Length 4. (Length = Body segments + 1).\nNew Head $H'=(6, 5)$.\nNew Body $B' = [(6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8)]$. New Length 5. This seems correct for growth.\n\nNext move from (6, 5) should be towards $x=9$. RIGHT to (7, 5) seems like a good start, unless (7, 5) is occupied or dangerous. (7, 5) is currently empty.\n\nPlan: Eat (6, 5) -> Move RIGHT to (7, 5), then continue moving RIGHT to collect (9, 5) and (9, 6).\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT to (8, 4): Safe from self.\n\n**Enemy Collision Check (H1 moves from (2, 0) to $H'_1$):**\nIf H1 moves LEFT to (1, 0): No collision with my trajectory or position (7, 4).\nIf H1 moves RIGHT to (3, 0): No collision.\nIf H1 moves UP to (2, 1): Collision with its own body segment. This seems like a suicide move for the AI, but we must consider if the opponent AI plays optimally. Given the opponent AI has 3 apples, it is likely competent. If it moves to (2, 1), it dies. If it dies, I automatically win since I am alive. However, since (2, 1) is part of its body, it must move to a safe square. A safe square for Snake 1 from (2, 0) must be (1, 0) or (3, 0).\n\nLet's assume Snake 1 moves to a safe square, e.g., LEFT to (1, 0), as it is closer to the apple at (0, 4).\n\n**Move Selection:**\nMoving LEFT to (6, 4) positions me optimally towards the cluster of apples (6, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6).\n\nLong-term plan: Move towards the cluster (6, 5). Since I am length 1, I want to eat an apple as soon as possible. The sequence LEFT, then UP, gets me to (6, 5) next turn.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 4):\nNext turn state: H=(6, 4). If I move UP, H=(6, 5), I eat apple 1.\n\nThis is the most aggressive, safe path towards the nearest reachable apple group.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Aim for the apple at (6, 5) by moving LEFT, then UP. After eating, aim for (9, 5) and (9, 6). Keep distance from Snake 1 unless necessary for defense or offense.\n\nLEFT (7, 4) -> (6, 4)\n\nLEFT",

If I was at (7, 4) last turn, LEFT would put me at (6, 4), matching the current state.\n\n**Target Selection:**\nThe nearest apple reachable in two moves is (6, 5).\nPath: (6, 4) -> UP -> (6, 5) [Eat next turn].\n\n**Safety Check from (6, 4):**\n1. **Self-Collision:** Since I am length 1, I cannot collide with my body unless I move directly backward to where I came from (which was (7, 4) if the previous LEFT move was valid).\n   * Previous position (for backtracking avoidance): (7, 4).\n2. **Board Bounds:** (6, 4) is safe.\n3. **Candidate Moves:**\n    * UP to (6, 5): Lands on an Apple A. This is the target move.\n    * DOWN to (6, 3): Safe.\n    * LEFT to (5, 4): Safe.\n    * RIGHT to (7, 4): Returns to previous position. Safe.\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (H1 from (2, 0)):**\nSnake 1 is likely targeting the closest apple, (0, 4), or perhaps moving towards the center cluster. Safe moves for Snake 1 are (1, 0) [LEFT] or (3, 0) [RIGHT].\n* If H1 moves to (1, 0), it approaches (0, 4).\n* If H1 moves to (3, 0), it moves inwards/rightwards.\n\n**Collision Risk with Enemy Head (H1):**\nMy possible next positions: (6, 5), (6, 3), (5, 4), (7, 4).\nSnake 1 possible next positions: (1, 0) or (3, 0).\nThere is **no risk** of head-on collision this turn regardless of their safe move choice.\n\n**Collision Risk with Enemy Body (B1):**\nB1 occupies (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2). My target move (6, 5) is far away. No risk of moving into their body.\n\n**Collision Risk with My Body (if I were longer):**\nNot applicable as I am length 1. Backtracking to (7, 4) is safe as long as Snake 1 doesn't move there, which it won't ((1, 0) or (3, 0)).\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\nMoving UP to (6, 5) means eating the apple on Turn 9. This immediately increases my score and length, improving my defensive posture for subsequent turns. This is the optimal primary goal.\n\nIf I move UP:\nNew Head: (6, 5). Score -> 1.

My last move rationale assumed moving UP to (6, 5) would result in eating the apple **on Turn 9**.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the state based on the provided Turn 10 preamble:\n\n**State at Start of Turn 10:**\nYour Head: (6, 5)\nYour Body: [(6, 4)]\nYour Apples: 1 (This implies the apple at (6, 5) was NOT yet collected, or the score tracking is slightly delayed/inconsistent with the move choice description).\n\n*Looking at the board visual:*\nThe '0' is at (6, 5). This confirms the head is at (6, 5).\nThe 'T' (tail/body part) is at (6, 4).\nIf the head is at (6, 5) and the body is [(6, 4)], the snake is length 2. If score is 1, the previous position must have been (6, 4), and it moved to (6, 5) last turn, eating an apple.\n\nHowever, **the provided state listing implies the move for THIS turn (Turn 10) is about to happen from the listed position.**\n\nYour snake (ID: 0): Head: (6, 5), Body: [(6, 4)] (Length 2). Apples collected: 1.\n*This contradicts the analysis in the 'Last Move Rationale' which stated the head was at (6, 4) before the UP move on Turn 9, aimed at eating (6, 5).*\n\n**Assumption:** I must proceed based on the *current state provided at the top of Turn 10*, regardless of what the rationale for Turn 9 concluded, unless the rationale implies an outcome that determines the starting state.\n\nIf the Rationale moved UP from (6, 4) to (6, 5):\n1. If the move was UP to (6, 5) and it ate the apple A at (6, 5): Score should be 2. Body should be [(6, 4), (6, 5)]. *This contradicts the current state listed.*\n2. If the move was LEFT from (6, 4) to (5, 4) (as listed in the board visual T at (6, 4) shows the snake *just moved* there, but the head is listed at (6, 5)):\n\nLet's trust the visual board state and the provided snake list for Turn 10, as these describe the board *before* the Turn 10 move:\n**Current State (Start of Turn 10):**\nYour Head: (6, 5). Body: [(6, 4)]. Length 2. Score 1.\nBoard shows '0' clearly at (6, 5) and 'T' at (6, 4).\nBoard shows Apple 'A' at (5, 9), (9, 5), (9, 6), (0, 4), (3, 2).\nWAIT: The board visual shows A at (9, 5), but the snake head 0 is at (6, 5). This means the apple I was targeting in the Turn 9 rationale *is now gone* IF my Turn 9 move resulted in eating it.\n\nIf the Head is (6, 5) and Score is 1:\n1. The snake was at (6, 4) before its move in Turn 9.\n2. It moved to (6, 5) in Turn 9, collecting the apple there.\n3. If it collected the apple, Score should be 2 and Length 2 (Head (6, 5), Body [(6, 4)]).\n4. The current listed score is 1. This implies the apple at (6, 5) **was not eaten** OR the score represents apples collected *before* the last turn. Given the scoring convention, Score 1 means 1 apple collected *before* Turn 9, and the Turn 9 move resulted in collecting the second apple, but the state hasn't updated yet, OR the snake moved elsewhere.\n\n**Reconciling with Last Move Rationale:**\nThe rationale for Turn 9 chose UP to move to (6, 5) to eat the apple.\nIf that move was successful, we start Turn 10 at (6, 5), Score 2, Body [(6, 4), (6, 5)] (length 3).\n\n**If we MUST use the provided state for Turn 10 Head (6, 5) and Body [(6, 4)] and Score 1:**\nThis contradicts the rationale's outcome, suggesting the rationale described an *intended* move that perhaps didn't happen, or the system state reflects the position *before* the move, not after. Since the header says \"Turn: 10 / 150\", we are assessing the move for Turn 10.\n\nLet's assume the state listed at the top **is the state at the start of Turn 10, before my move**, and the **rationale described the move that *led* to this state, implying an error in describing the outcome or score tracking**:\nStart Turn 10: Head (6, 5), Body [(6, 4)]. Length 2. Score 1. (This implies the snake was at (6, 4) at T9, moved to (6, 5) T9, but failed to eat the apple OR the apple list is updated).\n\n**Apples for Turn 10:** (9, 5), (9, 6), (5, 9), (0, 4), (3, 2).\nThe apple that was at (6, 5) is **missing** from the T10 apple list. This strongly suggests the move UP on Turn 9 *succeeded* in eating the apple at (6, 5).\n\n**Revised State for Turn 10 (Based on successful T9 move described in Rationale):**\nHead: (6, 5)\nBody: [(6, 4), (6, 5)] (Length 3. Body ordered head to tail, so new segment is right behind head). **No, body is ordered head-to-tail. If H=(6, 5) and it ate, the segment it just left, (6, 4), remains the second segment. The previous head position (6, 4) becomes the new body segment adjacent to the new head (6, 5). The old body segment (if any) shifts back.**\nIf H was (6, 4), Body []. T9 Move UP to (6, 5) eating apple. New H=(6, 5). New Body=[(6, 4)]. Score 2. (Length 2).\nIf H was (6, 4), Body [(7, 4)] (Example). T9 Move UP to (6, 5) eating apple. New H=(6, 5). New Body=[(6, 4), (7, 4)]. Score N+1. (Length L+1).\n\nGiven the starting state: Head (6, 5), Body [(6, 4)]. Length 2. Score 1.\nThis strongly resembles a snake of length 2, where the head moved one step in the previous turn and **did not eat**. If the snake was at (6, 4) and moved UP to (6, 5) without eating, the body would remain [(6, 4)]. Score remains 1.\n\n**I must follow the state listed explicitly at the start of Turn 10:**\nH=(6, 5). B=[(6, 4)]. Score=1. Length 2.\n*Move Backward avoidance check:* If I moved from (6, 4) to (6, 5) last turn, moving DOWN to (6, 4) is backward movement and should be avoided if possible, but it's not strictly illegal unless that spot is occupied by the tail segment (which is (6, 4) itself). Wait, if H=(6, 5) and B=[(6, 4)], moving DOWN to (6, 4) means the head moves into its own body segment, which is an immediate death (Rule: If your head moves into any snake's body, you die).\n\n**Safety Check for T10 based on provided state H=(6, 5), B=[(6, 4)]:**\n1. **DOWN to (6, 4):** Collision with Body segment (6, 4). **FATAL.**\n2. **UP to (6, 6):** Safe location.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 5):** Safe location.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 5):** Safe location.\n\n**Target Analysis (Apples: (9, 5), (9, 6), (5, 9), (0, 4), (3, 2))**\nNearest apple is (9, 5) or (9, 6) (distance ~4 moves) or (5, 9) (distance ~4 moves). (3, 2) is close too (2 moves).\n\n(3, 2) is 3 moves away: (6, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) [Too long].\n(6, 5) to (3, 2): |6-3| + |5-2| = 6 steps minimum.\n(6, 5) to (5, 9): |6-5| + |5-9| = 5 steps minimum if we ignore obstacles.\n\nLet's prioritize moving towards the cluster near the top right: (9, 5), (9, 6). Target (9, 5). Manhattan distance 4+0 = 4 moves via (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5) assuming straight path.\n\n**Enemy Snake 1:** H1=(1, 1), B1=[(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)]. Length 4. Apples 3.\nSnake 1 is near (0, 4). It might aim for (0, 4) or move towards the center/right side.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (T10 Move):**\nSafe moves for H1=(1, 1):\n* UP to (1, 2): Safe.\n* DOWN to (1, 0): Collision with Body segment (1, 0). **Self-collision/Illegal move for Enemy?** No, an enemy can move into its own segment if that segment is NOT the one it just vacated (the implied previous position). Since (1, 0) is explicitly listed in B1, moving there means H1 moves onto B1[0]. *This results in the enemy dying unless rules state enemies ignore self-collision? Standard competitive snake rules imply self-collision kills the snake.*\nLet's assume standard safe rules apply for enemies too, meaning they avoid moving onto their body segments.\nIf H1=(1, 1) and B1=[(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)]:\nNeighbors of (1, 1): (0, 1), (2, 1) [occupied by B1], (1, 0) [occupied by B1], (1, 2) [Empty].\nPossible T10 moves for Snake 1: **(0, 1) or (1, 2)**.\n\nSnake 1 likely targets (0, 4) or stays near its score base.\nIf Snake 1 moves LEFT to (0, 1), it hunts (0, 4).\nIf Snake 1 moves UP to (1, 2), it moves towards the center.\n\n**Safety Check against Snake 1 Moves:**\nMy safe moves: (6, 6), (5, 5), (7, 5).\nSince Snake 1 will be far away from (6, 5), there is no immediate collision risk with H1 or B1 this turn.\n\n**Evaluation of My Safe Moves:**\n1. **RIGHT (7, 5):** Moves towards the right edge/top right apples (9, 5), (9, 6). Manhattan distance to (9, 5) reduces by 1. (5 steps remain).\n2. **LEFT (5, 5):** Moves towards the center/down. Manhattan distance to (3, 2) reduces by 1 in X. (5 steps remain).\n3. **UP (6, 6):** Moves towards the top edge/center. Manhattan distance to (5, 9) reduces by 1 in Y. (4 steps remain).\n\nThe cluster (9, 5), (9, 6) seems like a good short-term goal, especially since Snake 1 is heavily invested in the bottom left (0, 4). Moving RIGHT seems strategically sound to corner these apples before Snake 1 expands too much.\n\nMove RIGHT to (7, 5).\n\n*Long Term Plan:* Secure the (9, 5)/(9, 6) apples cluster. Then pivot towards (5, 9) OR (3, 2) depending on Snake 1's expansion path. Given Snake 1 is currently confined toward the left/bottom, claiming the right side seems favorable.\n\n**Turn 10 Move Selection: RIGHT**\n\nRIGHT",

Body length remains 2. Score remains 1.\nThis perfectly matches the state listed for Turn 11: H=(7, 5), B=[(6, 5)], Score=1.\n*The visual board state provided above seems to be the result from Turn 9, before the Turn 10 evaluation.* I must rely on the explicit lists provided for the start of Turn 11.\n\n**State at Start of Turn 11 (Current):**\nYour Head (H0): (7, 5). Body: [(6, 5)]. Length 2. Score 1.\nEnemy Head (H1): (1, 2). Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)]. Length 4. Score 3.\nApples: (9, 5), (9, 6), (5, 9), (0, 4), (3, 2).\n\n**Safety Check (H0 = (7, 5), B0 = [(6, 5)]):**\n1. UP (7, 6): Safe.\n2. DOWN (7, 4): Safe.\n3. LEFT (6, 5): Collision with Body segment (6, 5). **FATAL.** (Cannot move backwards into the tail segment).\n4. RIGHT (8, 5): Safe.\n\nSafe Moves: (7, 6), (7, 4), (8, 5).\n\n**Enemy Move Prediction (H1 = (1, 2), B1 = [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)]):**\nNeighbors of (1, 2): (0, 2), (2, 2), (1, 1) [Body], (1, 3).\nAs determined in the last rationale, valid moves for Enemy 1 were likely (0, 2) or (1, 3). Snake 1 is probably heading towards (0, 4) or expanding towards the center.\nIf H1 moves LEFT to (0, 2), it is far from H0.\nIf H1 moves UP to (1, 3), it is far from H0.\nNo immediate self-collision danger for H0 from H1's possible moves.\n\n**Collision Check (H0 vs H1):**\nH1 could move to (0, 2), (2, 2), or (1, 3). None of these intersect with H0's safe moves: (7, 6), (7, 4), (8, 5). No head-on required.\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\nGoal: (9, 5) or (9, 6) remains 2 steps via (8, 5). (5, 9) is 3 steps via (7, 6) or 4 steps via (8, 5). (3, 2) is far.\n\nMove (8, 5) gets me closest to the (9, 5) apple in one move (1 step away next turn).\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n1. **RIGHT (8, 5):** Distance to (9, 5) becomes 1. Excellent progress toward the cluster.\n2. **UP (7, 6):** Distance to (5, 9) becomes 2. Also good progress towards a central apple.\n3. **DOWN (7, 4):** Moves away from most apples, towards the enemy base.\n\nPrioritizing the nearest, easiest cluster: (9, 5) and (9, 6). Moving RIGHT sets up a potential apple grab on Turn 12.\n\nLong-Term Plan Summary: Continue pathing towards the right/top right apples cluster ((9, 5), (9, 6)). Monitor Snake 1, which currently lags in scoring but is positioned near the isolated (0, 4) apple. If Snake 1 moves generally upward/rightward, I will maintain control of the right edge. If Snake 1 moves towards me, I need high mobility to avoid confrontation until I can grow larger.\n\n**Decision: RIGHT**\n\nRIGHT",

Re-checking the state transition from Turn 10 to 11 for H1):\n\n*T10 H1: (1, 2), B: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)]* (Wait, this body structure looks like Snake 1 grew on T9 and then moved, resulting in a slightly longer body than shown in the T11 description if it had eaten on T10. Let's stick strictly to the *Start of Turn 12* state provided.)\n\n**Start of Turn 12 H1:** Head: (2, 2), Body: [(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)]. Length 4. (Implies H1 ate an apple on its last move, resulting in H=(2, 2), B=[(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)]). This means the apple at (3, 2) or (0, 4) might have been eaten by Snake 1 recently, or that the body length listed earlier was slightly off relative to the apple count difference (Score 3 vs Score 1).\n\nH1 at (2, 2). Body = [(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)]. Tail is (1, 0).\nPossible moves for H1:\n1. UP (2, 3): Safe from own body.\n2. DOWN (2, 1): Safe from own body.\n3. LEFT (1, 2): Collision with Body segment (1, 2). **FATAL.**\n4. RIGHT (3, 2): Safe from own body. This is an apple!\n\nIf H1 moves RIGHT to (3, 2), H1 eats an apple and grows.\nIf H1 moves UP to (2, 3), H1 moves toward the center top.\n\n**Collision Check (H0 vs H1 potential moves):**\nH0 Safe Moves: (8, 6), (8, 4), (9, 5) [Apple Grab]\nH1 potential moves: (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2) [Apple Grab]\n\nSince H0 is moving to (9, 5) and H1 is clustered near (2, 2), there is no risk of head-on or body collision this turn.\n\n**Decision:** Eating the apple at (9, 5) is the optimal move to increase score and length immediately.\n\nLong-Term Plan for Turn 13: If the move RIGHT succeeds, H0=(9, 5), B=[(8, 5), (7, 5)]. The next apple is (9, 6), which is 1 step UP. H1 will likely continue moving towards the center or exploit its lead. I must secure (9, 6) next turn.\n\nPlan: Move towards the nearest apple (9, 5).

Its move this turn is independent of my move, but since I just ate, the score difference is $3-2=1$. Snake 1 must have eaten on T12 to have 4 apples now, or the initial state description for T13 is showing H1's state *after* its T12 move, which gained it an apple. Let's verify H1's T12 move based on T12 state: H1=(2, 2), B=[(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)]. A possible move to (3, 2) would have eaten the apple currently listed at (3, 6) in the T13 list if it was at (3, 2) during T12. The T13 apple list reflects the board *after* all T12 moves + my T12 apple grab IF there were no H1 apple grabs.

H0 moves to (9, 6), Score becomes 3, Body length becomes 4 (Head: (9, 6), Body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]). This is highly desirable as it maintains forward momentum along the edge and closes the gap in score.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nMove UP to grab (9, 6). This places the snake at (9, 6). The next potential apple is (5, 9) or (1, 4). Moving towards (5, 9) involves moving LEFT then DOWN, or DOWN then LEFT, which is safe now that the snake is long. Snake 1 is still low on the board. Prioritize apple collection.\n\nIf UP succeeds, the next move should evaluate paths towards (5, 9) or (1, 4) while ensuring H1 doesn't corner me. Since H1 is far away, directly maximizing score is still the best strategy.\n\nDecision: Move UP to secure the second edge apple.\n\nUP",

Moving LEFT seems slightly better as it reduces the Y coordinate, aiming the head towards the cluster of lower apples ((3, 6), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 0)) rather than the single high apple (5, 9). Since H1 is currently sitting near the middle (3, 3), getting closer to it is not a primary concern yet, but keeping distance while moving towards accessible nearby apples is key. (3, 6) is currently the most centrally located high-value target among reachable ones.\n\nChoosing LEFT to begin maneuvering toward the center targets.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 6). Continue maneuvering towards the cluster of central/left apples, prioritizing (3, 6) or (1, 4) next, while monitoring Snake #1's movement. Since Snake #1 is still relatively small compared to its score (4 apples, size 5), it might be trying to grow large quickly. Keep clear maneuvering space.\n\nLEFT",

H1 is at (3, 4).\n\nWe chose LEFT last turn to move towards the central apples. Now we are at (8, 6).\nTarget Analysis:\n1. (3, 6): Requires 5 LEFT moves (or a mix of directions). Distance to (3, 6) is $\\sqrt{(8-3)^2 + (6-6)^2} = 5$.\n2. (5, 9): Requires 3 LEFT, 3 UP moves. Distance is $\\sqrt{(8-5)^2 + (6-9)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{18} \\approx 4.24$.\n3. (1, 4): Requires 7 LEFT, 2 DOWN moves. Distance is $\\sqrt{(8-1)^2 + (6-4)^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 4} = \\sqrt{53} \\approx 7.28$.\n\n(5, 9) is numerically the closest apple. However, moving UP to (8, 7) places us closer to the top edge, potentially isolating us from the lower apples which Snake #1 is currently inhabiting/near.\n\nMove (8, 7) - UP: Moves towards (5, 9). Next move options are (7, 7) or (8, 8) or (9, 7) (if available, but (9,6) is body). From (8, 7), we are still relatively central on the Y axis.\n\nMove (7, 6) - LEFT: Moves towards (3, 6) and (5, 9). This continues the horizontal drive established last turn. From (7, 6), the next move could be (6, 6) or (7, 7).\n\nSince the previous move (LEFT) aimed towards central targets (like 3, 6), continuing that trend with LEFT seems strategically prudent to maximize access to the main cluster of remaining apples ((3, 6), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 0)). Apple (5, 9) is high up and might require significant upward travel later.\n\nLet's check the path to (3, 6) via LEFT moves:\nT14 -> (8, 6)\nT15 -> (7, 6) [LEFT]\nT16 -> (6, 6) [LEFT]\nT17 -> (5, 6) [LEFT]\nT18 -> (4, 6) [LEFT]\nT19 -> (3, 6) [LEFT] (Apple grab)\nThis path is efficient if Snake #1 doesn't intercept (4, 6) or (5, 6) unexpectedly. Snake #1 is currently at (3, 4) and seems focused on the lower left quadrant.\n\nIf we go UP to (8, 7):\nT15 -> (8, 7) [UP]\nT16 -> (7, 7) or (8, 8) [LEFT or UP] (Moving towards (5, 9)).\n\nGiven the current position (8, 6) is already aligned with the X-coordinate of the target apple (3, 6) (i.e., y=6), moving horizontally towards the required X coordinate (3) seems the most direct path to the nearest cluster target.\n\nChoosing LEFT.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving primarily LEFT (decreasing X coordinate) to target the apple at (3, 6). Monitor Snake #1's position, ensuring we maintain separation, especially as we approach X=3. If Snake #1 moves significantly upward near (3, 6), we must be ready to pivot towards (5, 9) or the apples at Y=0/1/4, or potentially move around it via Y=7 if necessary. For now, stick to the direct path to (3, 6).\n\nLEFT",

If it collected 4 apples, its length must be 4+1=5 segments + head = 6 cells long including the head, or 5 cells total including head + 4 segments. Given H1 has 4 apples, its length is 5).

H1 moving to (1, 4) to eat the apple is a distinct possibility. If H1 eats (1, 4), it grows to length 6, possibly becoming harder to manage later.\n\nIf H0 chooses LEFT -> (6, 6).

This moves us towards (5, 9), which is currently the nearest apple by Euclidean distance ($\\sqrt{18} \\approx 4.24$), although distance 5 to (3, 6) is very close. Moving UP pulls us away from the cluster H1 is near.\n\nIf H0 chooses DOWN -> (7, 5). This moves us slightly down, potentially positioning us better for lower apples later, but slightly further away from (3, 6).\n\nComparing potential paths:\nPath to (3, 6) via LEFT: (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (3, 6). This is a very direct line along Y=6.\nPath to (5, 9) via UP: (7, 6) -> (7, 7) -> [X or Y] -> ...\n\nSince the path to (3, 6) is so clean and minimizes immediate vertical deviation, and H1 seems preoccupied in the lower-left quadrant (near (1, 4)), continuing the horizontal pursuit of (3, 6) seems optimal.\n\nChosen move: LEFT, moving to (6, 6).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving LEFT on successive turns towards apple (3, 6). Monitor H1 closely. If H1 moves high (towards Y=5/6/7), we may need to adjust to secure (3, 6) or pivot to (5, 9). If H1 moves towards the lower apples (0, 0) or (0, 4), we should attempt to eat (3, 6) before it can block our path or pivot to challenge us for it.\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6)]. Length 4.\nH1: (1, 4). Body: [(2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2)]. Length 6. (Note: The previous rationale assumed H1 moved, but the current board state shows H1 *is* at (1, 4). This implies H1 ate Apple (1, 4) on Turn 16).\n\n**Revisiting Last Move Information/Turn Flow:**\nThe provided \"Last Move Information\" (Turn 16 Rationale) selected LEFT, moving H0 from (7, 6) to (6, 6).\nThe provided current state shows H0 at (6, 6). That's consistent.\nIf H1 was at (2, 4) for Turn 16, and it moved to (1, 4) eating the apple, its body should have grown by 1 segment.\n\nLet's verify the provided state against the state implied by the previous rationale (where H1 was predicted to move to (1, 4) as a possibility):\nT16 H1 potential moves included (1, 4) hitting apple (1, 4). If H1 executed this, its length should be 6 now, which matches the current state (5 body segments + head).\n\n**Safety Check for H0 at (6, 6):**\nPossible Moves (New Head Position):\n1. UP (6, 7): Safe.\n2. DOWN (6, 5): Safe.\n3. LEFT (5, 6): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (7, 6): Collision with Body segment (7, 6). **FATAL.**\n\nSafe Moves: (6, 7), (6, 5), (5, 6).\n\n**Enemy Move Prediction (H1 at (1, 4)):**\nH1 Body: [(2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2)]. Tail is (2, 2).\nPossible moves for H1:\n1. UP (1, 5): Safe.\n2. DOWN (1, 3): Safe.\n3. LEFT (0, 4): Apple (0, 4) is there. Safe if taken.\n4. RIGHT (2, 4): Collision with Body segment (2, 4). **FATAL.**\n\nH1 potential surviving moves: (1, 5), (1, 3), (0, 4).\n\n**Collision Check (H0 vs H1 potential moves):**\nH0 Safe moves: (6, 7), (6, 5), (5, 6). H1 is at (1, 4). No immediate head-to-head collision.\nWe must check if any of H1's safe moves land on H0's body [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6)].\n*   H1 moves to (1, 5), (1, 3), or (0, 4). None of these land on H0's body segments. Safe for H0.\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\nCurrent apples: (5, 9), (3, 6), (0, 4), (0, 0), (4, 9). (Apple (1, 4) was just taken by H1).\nH0 is at (6, 6). H1 is at (1, 4).\n\nThe strategy established last turn was to move LEFT towards (3, 6).\nCurrent position (6, 6). Target (3, 6).\nMove LEFT to (5, 6) continues this path directly. (Distance 3 remaining).\n\nIf H0 moves LEFT to (5, 6):\nH1 might move towards (0, 4) or (0, 0), or might move UP towards (5, 9) / (4, 9) to challenge us for the top apples.\n\nIf H0 moves UP to (6, 7):\nThis puts us on the Y=7 line, moving strongly towards (5, 9) or (4, 9). Distance to (5, 9) is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$.\n\nIf H0 moves DOWN to (6, 5):\nThis puts us further into the middle zone, maybe positioning for (0, 0) or (0, 4) later, but that path seems slower and guarantees H1 gets the higher apples first.\n\n**Comparing Paths:**\n1. Path to (3, 6) via LEFT: 3 more moves required assuming H1 doesn't interfere.\n2. Path to (5, 9) via UP: 3 more moves (e.g., (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 9) if moving carefully, or maybe 2 moves if we reach (5, 8) and then need 1 more move to 5, 9). Wait, distance calculation: (6, 6) to (5, 9) is 1 left, 3 up. Total 4 moves if perfectly linear.\n\nThe apple (3, 6) is currently the closest apple that H1 is unlikely to contest immediately, as H1 is far left and low. Securing (3, 6) next solidifies our position and puts us ahead of H1 in score lead (4 vs 5 is still bad, but we are closing the gap if H1 plateaus).\n\nContinuing the path to (3, 6) via LEFT seems like the most controlled path forward, minimizing risk and maximizing progress toward an immediate, available target.\n\nPlan: Continue moving LEFT towards (3, 6) for the next few turns. Monitor H1's movement towards the upper apples (5, 9) or (4, 9).\n\nLEFT",

The state provided for T18 shows H1 at (0, 4) and having 6 apples. If H1 ate an apple at (0, 4) on T17, its length should be 7 segments (6 body + 1 head).

If H0 takes (3, 6), the score becomes 4 vs 6.\n\nChoosing LEFT to reach (4, 6).\n\nLong-term plan: Secure (3, 6).

Safe moves appear to be UP (0, 5) or DOWN (0, 3). H1 is unlikely to interfere with the central area where H0 is moving.\n\n**Target Selection:**\nApple (3, 6) is 2 moves away via LEFT: (5, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (3, 6).

It is currently near the bottom left. H1 has 6 apples and is longer than H0 (L=7 vs L=6). H1 will likely move towards (0, 0) or up towards the center.\nPossible Moves for H1:\n1. UP (0, 3): Collision with Body segment (0, 3). **FATAL.**\n2. DOWN (0, 1): Safe.\n3. LEFT/RIGHT: Off the board or into unexplored areas if H1 is following gravity/pathfinding towards an apple.\n\nLet's re-examine H1's body: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3)]. Tail is (3, 3).\nIf H1 moves DOWN to (0, 1): Safe.\nIf H1 moves RIGHT to (1, 2): Safe.\n\nIf H1 moves UP to (0, 3), it dies instantly because (0, 3) is occupied by its own body segment. This means H1 *must* move DOWN or RIGHT (or possibly another direction if we miscalculated its prior move, but assuming standard game dynamics where the head can't move into an occupied spot):\nIf H1 moves RIGHT to (1, 2): Safe.\n\nSince H1 appears constrained or forced away from (0, 3), H0 generally doesn't need to worry about an immediate head-on collision unless H0 moves to (1, 2) and H1 moves to (1, 2) OR H0 moves to (0, 1) and H1 moves to (0, 1).\n\n**Strategy:**\nH0 needs to maintain progress upwards towards the cluster of apples at Y=9.\nCurrent position (3, 6).\nMoving UP to (3, 7) seems like the most direct path towards (2, 8) or continuing towards (4, 9)/(5, 9).\nMoving LEFT to (2, 6) moves sideways, potentially bringing H0 closer to H1's current location (0, 2), but H1 looks busy on the left edge.\nMoving DOWN to (3, 5) moves backward, which is unnecessary unless escaping a threat or pursuing a low apple (0, 0). (0, 0) is further away than moving up.\n\nThe safest and most direct route towards the highest value apples (Y=9) appears to be UP (3, 7).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nContinue moving generally UP/Northeast towards the apples at Y=9 ((5, 9), (4, 9)). If (2, 8) is accessible first via (3, 7) -> (3, 8) -> (2, 8) or (4, 8) -> (2, 8), prioritize that.

(Note: The body in the initial prompt seems to list 4 segments + head, length 5. The rationale for T20 suggested H0 moved from (4, 6) to (3, 6) and ate an apple, resulting in length 6: [(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6)]. Let's reconcile the initial board state provided for T21 with the T20 rationale.)\n\n*Initial Board State for T21:*\nH0: (3, 7)\nBody: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)]\nThis configuration implies H0 ate 3 apples (Length 4 body + head = 5 total segments). If H0 has 4 apples, it must have a length of 5 (1 start + 4 eaten). The body list has 4 entries, meaning L=5.\n\n*T20 Rationale Conclusion:*\nT20 move was LEFT, consuming A(3, 6). H0 moved from (4, 6) to (3, 6). Length increased from 5 to 6. New state should be H0=(3, 6), Body=[(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6)].\n\n*T21 Prompt State:*\nH0: (3, 7). Body: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)]. (Length 5, A=4). This is inconsistent with the T20 rationale claiming A=5 and L=6 after eating.\n\n**Assumption Reconciliation:** Since I must base my move on the **currently provided board state for T21**, I will use:\nH0: (3, 7)\nBody: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)] (Length 5, A=4, Tail at (6, 6)).\nMy last move was UP (implied by the prompt structure, which means T20 was UP, contradicting the T20 rationale which described a successful LEFT move).\n\n**Crucial Decision:** I must trust the provided **Current State** for T21 over the conflicting \"Last Move Information\" block, as the current state defines where I begin.\n\n**Current State (T21 Start):**\nH0: (3, 7)\nBody: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)] (Tail is (6, 6))\nA=4.\nApples remaining: (5, 9), (0, 0), (4, 9), (2, 8), (3, 0) (5 apples remain, consistent with 4 eaten + 1 starting segment = L=5).\n\nEnemy S1: H1: (0, 1), L=7, A=6. Body: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)]. (Tail is (3, 4)).\n\n**Safety Check for H0 at (3, 7):**\n1. UP (3, 8): Safe, no walls or bodies.\n2. DOWN (3, 6): Collision with Body segment (3, 6). **FATAL.**\n3. LEFT (2, 7): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (4, 7): Safe.\n\nSafe Moves for H0: (3, 8) [UP], (2, 7) [LEFT], (4, 7) [RIGHT].\n\n**Apple Check:**\nClosest apples are (2, 8) (1 unit away if moving UP/LEFT), and the cluster at Y=9.\n(3, 7) -> UP -> (3, 8) -> UP -> (3, 9) [Apple (5, 9) or (4, 9) reachable soon].\n(3, 7) -> LEFT -> (2, 7) -> UP -> (2, 8) [Reaches A(2, 8) next turn if path is clear].\n\n**Enemy H1 Prediction (H1 at (0, 1)):**\nH1 is at the bottom left corner. It is looking for A(0, 0).\nPossible Moves for H1:\n1. UP (0, 2): Collision with Body segment (0, 2). **FATAL.**\n2. DOWN (-1, 1) / (10, 1): Off board.\n3. LEFT (Off board).\n4. RIGHT (1, 1): Safe.\n\nH1 is severely constrained or forced to move RIGHT to (1, 1) to avoid instant self-collision (moving to (0, 2)). If H1 moves RIGHT, it targets (0, 0) only if it immediately turns back down or utilizes the gap between (0, 0) and (0, 1). If H1 moves to (1, 1), it aims to move towards the center or continue exploring rightward, likely abandoning the (0, 0) apple for a turn or two unless it loops immediately.\n\nGiven H1 is cornered, the immediate threat from H1 is low, especially since H0 is high up at Y=7.\n\n**Strategy Evaluation:**\n1. **UP (3, 8):** Direct progress towards the highest apples ((4, 9), (5, 9)) and close to (2, 8). This feels like the best progress.\n2. **LEFT (2, 7):** Targets A(2, 8) possibly on the next move by going (2, 7) -> (2, 8). This is aggressive apple hunting.\n3. **RIGHT (4, 7):** Moves away from the nearest apple (2, 8) and towards the center mass of the board, maximizing space but not making immediate contact with food.\n\nTargeting (2, 8) via LEFT seems highly efficient:\nTurn 21: LEFT -> (2, 7)\nTurn 22: UP -> (2, 8) [Eat apple, L=6, A=5]\n\nTargeting Y=9 cluster via UP:\nTurn 21: UP -> (3, 8)\nTurn 22: UP -> (3, 9)\nTurn 23: LEFT/RIGHT towards (4, 9) or (5, 9).\n\nSince (2, 8) is guaranteed to be reachable quickly via LEFT, and it's the closest apple according to Manhattan distance, pursuing it seems prudent to increase length/score immediately. If I go UP, (2, 8) might be claimed by H1 next turn if H1 moves away from the corner aggressively, although H1 seems unlikely to reach (2, 8) from (0, 1) quickly.\n\nLet's recalculate proximity:\nDistance to A(2, 8) from (3, 7):\nIf UP: (3, 8) -> (3, 9) or (2, 8) or (4, 8). Requires 2 moves minimum.\nIf LEFT: (2, 7) -> (2, 8). Requires 2 moves minimum.\n\nThe paths are equally efficient in terms of steps for the next apple. However, moving UP keeps H0 more central to the Y=9 apples which constitute the largest cluster remaining.\n\nLet's choose UP to maintain altitude and head towards the top edge where the majority of food is located.\n\nMove: UP (3, 7) -> (3, 8). Safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue ascending towards Y=9 cluster. Use UP as the primary direction unless a collision risk presents itself or an apple is immediately reachable via LEFT/RIGHT that offers a better gain-to-risk ratio. Keep an eye on H1's movement pattern out of the corner.\n\nUP\n**END CRITICAL ANALYSIS FOR TURN 21**\n\nUP",

Note: This body state implies that the move performed in T21 (UP) did *not* land on an apple, thus the length remains 5 segments + head = 6 total, but score remains 4. The prompt data shows H0 (3, 8) and Body [(3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)] for T22 start, which is length 5, A=4. This means the body list provided in the prompt is 4 segments long, not 5. Let's use the prompt's explicit body configuration for T22, which implies a length of 5: Head (3, 8) + 4 body segments = 5 total cells, A=4.)\n\n*Reconciling Length:* If A=4, length should be 5 segments (Head + 4 body cells).\nPrompt T22: H=(3, 8), B=[(3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)]. -> L=5. This IS consistent with A=4.\nThe previous turn (T21) must have been UP from (3, 7) leading to (3, 8) without eating an apple.\n\nH0 Position: (3, 8)\nBody: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)] (Tail at (5, 6))\nA=4.\n\nApples remaining: (5, 9), (4, 9), (2, 8), (3, 0), (1, 0).\n\nEnemy S1: H1: (0, 0) (Predicted move for T21 was assumed to be SAFE, likely RIGHT to (1, 1) as (0, 0) is an apple and (0, 1) is Head in T21 state description, but my T21 analysis predicted H1 at (0, 1) which is inconsistent with the T22 board state that shows H1 at (0, 0).)\n\n**Re-analyzing Enemy State based on T22 Board:**\nSnake #1 - Head: (0, 0), Body: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)], Apples: 7.\nThis means S1 *ate* A(0, 0) in T21 and grew, moving from somewhere else to (0, 0) perhaps, or the board description listed the body *before* eating in T21, and now it lists the body *after* eating in T22.\nIf S1 has A=7, its length should be 8. The body lists 7 segments, so L=8. This matches.\nIf H1 is now at (0, 0) and A(0, 0) is gone, then S1 must have moved from (0, 1) to (0, 0) by moving DOWN and eating the apple.\n\n**Crucial Update:** H1 starts T22 at (0, 0) having just eaten A(0, 0).\n\n**Safety Check for H0 at (3, 8):**\n1. UP (3, 9): Safe.\n2. DOWN (3, 7): Safe (Body segment).\n3. LEFT (2, 8): Collision with Apple A(2, 8). Safe.\n4. RIGHT (4, 8): Safe.\n\nSafe Moves for H0: (3, 9) [UP], (3, 7) [DOWN], (2, 8) [LEFT], (4, 8) [RIGHT].\n\n**Enemy H1 Movement Prediction (H1 at (0, 0), A=7, L=8, Tail at (3, 4)):**\nH1 likely wants to approach the cluster at Y=9 (A(4, 9), A(5, 9)). It is currently at the bottom left corner.\nPossible moves for H1:\n1. UP (0, 1): Collision with Body segment (0, 1). **FATAL.**\n2. DOWN (Off board).\n3. LEFT (Off board).\n4. RIGHT (1, 0): Safe.\n\nH1 is strongly constrained. If H1 moves RIGHT to (1, 0), it heads towards A(1, 0) on the next turn. If H1 has no other safe options, OR if it chooses to die (which it won't unless forced), this matters. Since (0, 1) is occupied by its own tail, H1 MUST move RIGHT to (1, 0) or (1, -1) (off board) or die by hitting itself.\nWait, H1's head is at (0, 0). Body starts at (0, 1). Moving UP hits (0, 1). Moving DOWN/LEFT is off board. H1 must move RIGHT to (1, 0).\n\nIf H1 moves RIGHT to (1, 0):\nH0 must avoid collision with H1's *new* position (1, 0). (3, 8) is nowhere near (1, 0). No head-on collision risk.\n\n**Apple Hunting Strategy:**\nClosest apples relative to H0 (3, 8):\n1. A(2, 8): Distance 1 if moving LEFT. Reachable T22.\n2. A(3, 0), A(1, 0): Distance 8 if moving DOWN 2 steps, then LEFT/RIGHT towards them. Deeply inefficient now.\n3. A(4, 9), A(5, 9): Distance 1 if moving UP to (3, 9), then 1 or 2 more steps.\n\nPath 1: Target A(2, 8) via LEFT.\nT22: LEFT -> (2, 8). Eat Apple. H0 becomes L=6, A=5. Body: [(3, 8) -> (3, 7) -> (3, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> Tail moves to (2, 8)].\nIf H0 moves LEFT to (2, 8), the tail (5, 6) stays put (since it ate).\n\nPath 2: Target A(4, 9) cluster via UP.\nT22: UP -> (3, 9). Safe. T23: RIGHT -> (4, 9). Eat Apple. H0 becomes L=6, A=5.\n\nPath 1 (LEFT to (2, 8)) secures an apple immediately (T22) and increases score/length faster. It also positions H0 such that it can quickly turn towards the Y=9 cluster from a central but lower position, or continue exploring the lower half if needed.\n\nPath 2 (UP to (3, 9)) sets up eating the apple in T23.\n\nSince both paths secure an apple in 1 or 2 turns, securing it in 1 turn (LEFT) is generally preferred if safe.\n\n**Safety Check for LEFT move to (2, 8):**\n1. H0 Head moves to (2, 8).\n2. H1 moves to (1, 0). (No collision).\n3. H0 does not hit self. (3, 7) is not (2, 8), and backwards move would be to (3, 8) which is the cell H0 just left, and H0 does not move backwards inherently unless it's the only option. (3, 8) is occupied by H0's position at T21 start, not its body segment path. H0 moves from (3, 8) to (2, 8). The cell behind H0 relative to the turn direction (UP) was (3, 7). The cell behind H0 relative to the move direction (LEFT) is (3, 8) [old head], which is fine as the head moves away from it. The tail segment (5, 6) stays put. Safe.\n\nChoosing LEFT to immediately consume the closest available apple (2, 8).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure A(2, 8). Then, reassess positioning to target the dense cluster at Y=9, or move towards the far corner apples if the main cluster seems too contested. Keep S1 movement in mind; S1 is currently heading towards A(1, 0).\n\nLEFT\n**END CRITICAL ANALYSIS FOR TURN 22**",

Note: The tail (5, 6) from T22 start is now the second to last segment, and (2, 8) is the new segment adjacent to the head (3, 8) from T22 start, pushing the whole body.)\n\nLet's reconstruct the body transformation from T22:\nT22 Start Body (L=5, A=4): [(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)] (Tail is (5, 6)).\nT22 Move: LEFT to (2, 8), ate apple. New length L=6, A=5.\nThe new head is (2, 8). The old head (3, 8) becomes the next segment.\nNew Body (Head to Tail): [(2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)]. (Tail remains (5, 6)).\n\nH0: Head: (2, 8), Body: [(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 8)] - WAIT, this structure is incorrect based on standard snake mechanics where the old head becomes the new neighbor of the new head, and the tail drops off if no apple is eaten, OR the whole list shifts forward and the new cell is added to the front if an apple is eaten.\n\nSince A=5 now (meaning 1 apple eaten this turn):\nOld Head: (3, 8). Old Body: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)].\nNew Head: (2, 8).\nNew Body Sequence: (New Head) followed by (Old Head) followed by (Old Body excluding tail if growth occurred).\nIf length increased by 1 (A=4 -> A=5):\nNew list starts with (2, 8). Next is the old head (3, 8). Next are the segments (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6). The old tail (5, 6) is retained because growth happened.\nH0: Head: (2, 8), Body: [(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)]. (Length 6).\nLet's verify this matches the prompt's T23 state:\nPrompt T23 State: H: (2, 8), B: [(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)].\nThis structure confirms: Score A=5. Length L=6. The snake grew, and the tail (5, 6) was *retained* instead of dropped, and the old head (3, 8) shifted to position 1. This is the correct structure for a growth move.\n\nH0 Position: (2, 8)\nBody: [(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)] (Tail at (5, 6)).\n\nEnemy S1 State (After T22 move RIGHT to (1, 0)):\nH1 Position: (1, 0)\nBody: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)]. Apples: 7. (No growth assumed in T22 unless the apple at (1, 0) was present and eaten, but (1, 0) is listed as an apple location available now).\n\n**Rechecking T22 Enemy Move:**\nH1 started T22 at (0, 0), A=7. S1 moved RIGHT to (1, 0). (1, 0) was an apple.\nAssumption: S1 ate A(1, 0) in T22.\nIf S1 ate A(1, 0): A=8, Length increases by 1. New Tail is (3, 4).\nH1 Moves to (1, 0). Old body shifts. New body should have 8 segments + head. Current body listed has 8 segments (L=9, A=8?).\nPrompt T23 state for S1: H: (1, 0), B: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)], A=8.\nThis list has 8 segments listed. If A=8, L=9 total cells. This implies the tail segment was dropped because eating A(1, 0) caused growth, pushing the old tail off if the body list only shows 8 segments.\nIf S1 ate A(1, 0), the tail should have been retained, making L=10 (9 segments). The segmentation provided suggests S1 *did not* grow OR the list is truncated/misleading, OR the move to (1, 0) did not consume the apple for some reason (e.g., H0 pathing interfered, though that seems unlikely for S1).\n\nGiven the board state shows A(1, 0) still exists, S1 **did not** eat A(1, 0) in T22, OR the board state update is slightly delayed/incorrect regarding the apple at (1, 0).\nSince the board lists A(1, 0) present for T23, we must assume S1's move to (1, 0) was SAFE but did not consume an apple (perhaps the apple was consumed by another snake prior, or the list is simply wrong for T22 conclusion). Let's trust the list of available apples for T23.\n\nApples remaining for T23: (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 0), (5, 0), (4, 2). (A(2, 8) and A(1, 0) are gone from the available list). This confirms H0 ate A(2, 8) and S1 moved to (1, 0) but didn't get the apple. S1's score is still 8, length L=9 (H+8 body cells). This means S1 *did* grow in T22, likely eating an apple that was NOT A(1, 0) or A(2, 8). Since S1 moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0), and A(1, 0) is still there, this is a massive inconsistency.\n\n*Self-Correction based on Board State:*\nH0: A=5, L=6. Body ends at (5, 6). Safe zone around head is clear.\nS1: A=8, L=9. Head at (1, 0). Body is long, coiled in bottom left.\n\nTarget Apples for H0 (2, 8): (5, 9), (4, 9) [Cluster Y=9], (4, 2) [Close vertically], (3, 0), (5, 0) [Far bottom].\n\nH0 is currently high center-left. The cluster at Y=9 is the natural next target, but it requires moving UP from (2, 8) to (2, 9) then RIGHT.\n\n**Safety Check for H0 at (2, 8):**\n1. UP (2, 9): Safe.\n2. DOWN (2, 7): Safe.\n3. LEFT (1, 8): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (3, 8): Collision with Body segment (3, 8). **FATAL MOVE.**\n\nSafe Moves for H0: (2, 9) [UP], (2, 7) [DOWN], (1, 8) [LEFT].\n\n**Enemy Head Prediction (H1 at (1, 0)):**\nH1 wants the apples at Y=9, (4, 9), (5, 9), or the bottom ones (3, 0), (5, 0). It is far from Y=9 (distance 4-5 steps). It is 2 steps from A(3, 0) and A(0, 2) is blocked by body/wall. It could move UP to follow the center line.\nPossible moves for H1 (1, 0):\n1. UP (1, 1): Safe path towards center.\n2. DOWN (Off board).\n3. LEFT (0, 0): Collision with Body segment (0, 0). **FATAL.**\n4. RIGHT (2, 0): Seems likely.\n\nH1 is highly constrained. (0, 0) is occupied by its body, so it cannot move LEFT. (1, 1) (UP) or (2, 0) (RIGHT) are the primary safe/logical moves.\nIf H1 moves UP to (1, 1), H0 needs to stay clear of its path.\n\n**Strategy:**\nH0 is now at (2, 8). Target Y=9 cluster.\nPath: UP to (2, 9), then RIGHT to (3, 9), then RIGHT to (4, 9). This takes 3 turns.\n\nIf H0 moves UP to (2, 9):\nT23: UP -> (2, 9). Length remains L=6 (no apple).\n\nIf H0 moves DOWN to (2, 7):\nThis retreats from the high apples and moves toward proximity of enemy snake S1's general location, but potentially clears space to maneuver if S1 pushes up the center. Less aggressive.\n\nIf H0 moves LEFT to (1, 8):\nMoves away from vertical center and primary apple cluster. Less optimal.\n\nThe most direct route to the remaining high-value target apples (Y=9) is UP.\n\n**Collision potential:**\nIf H0 moves UP to (2, 9). If H1 moves UP to (1, 1), no immediate collision. If H1 moves RIGHT to (2, 0), no immediate collision. H0 is far away from H1.\n\nUP seems like the best move to maintain proximity to the currently highest-value apple cluster.\n\nLong-term plan: Focus on securing the cluster at Y=9. If S1 contests this area too aggressively, pivot to A(4, 2) or the bottom corner ones. Given S1 is stuck low, H0 has time.\n\n**Chosen Move: UP**\n\nUP",
