We\u2019re also clear that UP (to (6,6)) or DOWN (to (6,4)) are possible, but let\u2019s see which best reduces our distance to the nearest apples.\n\nRecall the apple positions:  \n\u2022 (5,2)  \n\u2022 (2,5)\n\nFrom (6,5):  \n\u2022 The Manhattan distance to (5,2) is |6\u20135| + |5\u20132| = 1 + 3 = 4.  \n\u2022 The Manhattan distance to (2,5) is |6\u20132| + |5\u20135| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nLet\u2019s check our possible moves:\n\n1. If we move LEFT to (5,5):  \n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (5,2) becomes |5\u20135| + |5\u20132| = 0 + 3 = 3.  \n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (2,5) becomes |5\u20132| + |5\u20135| = 3 + 0 = 3.  \nThis move clearly decreases the distance to both targets.\n\n2. If we move DOWN to (6,4):  \n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (5,2) becomes |6\u20135| + |4\u20132| = 1 + 2 = 3.  \n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (2,5) becomes |6\u20132| + |4\u20135| = 4 + 1 = 5.  \nThis move improves our distance to (5,2) but increases the distance to (2,5).\n\n3. If we move UP to (6,6):  \n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (5,2) becomes |6\u20135| + |6\u20132| = 1 + 4 = 5.  \n\u2003\u2013 Distance to (2,5) becomes |6\u20132| + |6\u20135| = 4 + 1 = 5.  \nThis move doesn't bring us closer to either target compared to moving LEFT.\n\nSince moving LEFT to (5,5) equally reduces the distance to both (5,2) and (2,5) by 1 step (decreasing them to 3), and there are no obstacles in that spot, moving LEFT is the optimal choice.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
