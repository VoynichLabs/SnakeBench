Its head is moving away from the snake's current path, so no immediate threat.\n- The enemy's body is not blocking the upward path to (2, 9).\n\n#### **Future Flexibility:**\n- After eating the apple at (2, 9), the snake can then explore left or right to reach other apples.\n- The upward movement aligns with the general direction of the closest apple, maximizing efficiency.\n\n---\n### **Long-Term Plan (Future Self Note):**\n1. **Next move:** Move **UP** to (2, 9) to eat the apple and grow.\n2. **After eating (2, 9):** Assess the next closest apple, likely (3, 2) or (6, 2).
