The apple at (4, 7) is also in the upper region. The apples at (8, 8) and (9, 3) are on the right side where the enemy snake currently is, making them potentially dangerous to pursue early.\n\n**Best move:** \nMoving UP keeps my options open and positions me to move left toward the high-concentration apple cluster at (0, 7)/(1, 9) area. This avoids the right side where my opponent is located.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\nContinue moving toward the upper-left apple cluster (0,7) and (1,9). Build length early by collecting these apples while staying away from the enemy snake on the right side. Once I have a reasonable length advantage, I can be more aggressive about central and right-side apples.\n\nUP",

The apple at (0, 7) is only 4 moves away if I go LEFT then UP multiple times. This seems like the most efficient path early game.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. Move LEFT toward x=0, collecting apples at (0, 7) and (1, 9) in the upper-left\n2. Once I have length advantage, consider the central apple at (4, 7)\n3.

It:\n- Keeps me alive\n- Directly collects an apple (my 2nd)\n- Positions me well for future moves\n- Opens up multiple options next turn\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- After collecting this apple at (1, 9), I should target the cluster of apples on the right: (8, 8), (7, 8)\n- Move RIGHT along row 8/9 to approach them\n- Avoid the enemy snake at (9, 0) - it's far away but monitor its movement\n\nUP",
