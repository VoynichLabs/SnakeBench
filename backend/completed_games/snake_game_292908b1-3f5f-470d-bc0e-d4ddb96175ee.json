          "rationale": "The board is 10x10. My snake (ID 0) is at (7, 6) with no body segments. The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2, 8) with no body segments. Apples are at various coordinates. Turn 0 of 150.\n\nFirst, I need to check for immediate death conditions for each possible move.\n\nCurrent position: (7, 6).\n\n- **UP**: Move to (7, 7). Check coordinates: (7, 7) is within 0-9. Check snake bodies: My body is empty. Enemy body is empty. No conflict. Check if moving into enemy head? Enemy head is at (2, 8). No. Is (7, 7) an apple? Yes, the apples list includes (7, 7). Moving onto an apple is safe and I would grow. So UP is safe.\n\n- **DOWN**: Move to (7, 5). Coordinates (7, 5) are valid. Empty body. No enemy head there. No apple. Safe.\n\n- **LEFT**: Move to (6, 6). Coordinates valid. Empty body. No enemy head. No apple. Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Move to (8, 6). Coordinates valid. Empty body. No enemy head. No apple. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe regarding collision with bodies or walls.\n\nNow, consider strategy. I have 0 apples. Enemy has 0 apples. It's turn 0. I want to eat apples to grow and eventually reach 30. I should prioritize moves that lead to apples while keeping options open.\n\nLooking at apples near me:\n- (7, 7) is directly UP from (7, 6).\n- (6, 3) is far away.\n- (7, 1) is far away.\n- (7, 3) is at (7, 3).\n- (8, 9) is far.\n- (9, 4) is far.\n\nThe closest apple is (7, 7) by moving UP. If I move UP, I eat the apple, grow to length 2 (head at 7,7, tail at 7,6). This gives me a point and positions me well.\n\nConsider enemy snake #1 at (2, 8). Where might it move? It has apples at (0,8), (1,8), (2,3), (3,0), (4,6), (4,8), (5,2), etc. It is at (2,8). Nearby apples: (0,8) is left, (1,8) is left, (4,8) is right, (2,3) is down. It might go for (1,8) or (4,8) or (0,8). It's unlikely to come to my side immediately. However, if I move UP to (7,7), I am in the upper middle. I should consider if moving UP blocks my future moves. After eating, my tail is at (7,6). From (7,7), I can move UP (to 7,8), DOWN (back to 7,6 - but that would be moving into my own tail? Actually, moving into the cell where my tail is currently is dangerous because if I move there, the tail might move away. In standard snake rules, if I move into the cell occupied by my tail, it is usually safe because the tail moves forward in the same turn (unless I grow). But I am growing this turn because I ate an apple. So my tail will not move; it stays at (7,6). Therefore, moving DOWN to (7,6) next turn would mean moving into my own body (the tail segment). That would kill me. So after eating at (7,7), I cannot move DOWN immediately. I must move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move UP to (7,7):\n- Next turn options: UP to (7,8), LEFT to (6,7), RIGHT to (8,7).\n- (7,8) is empty currently (check board: row 8 has A at (0,8), (1,8), (4,8) but (7,8) is dot). (6,7) is dot. (8,7) is dot. So all options are open.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,5):\n- I don't get an apple. Position (7,5). Next turn options: UP (back to 7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5).\n- (7,6) is currently my head, but if I move DOWN, my head moves to (7,5) and my tail stays at (7,6) (since I didn't eat). Wait, actually, if I don't eat, my tail moves forward. My body is currently empty, so I have no tail. Wait, the description says \"Body: none\". So length is 1. If I move without eating, my tail effectively disappears from (7,6) and my new head is at (7,5). So the cell (7,6) becomes empty. So moving UP next turn is safe.\n- So DOWN is safe but doesn't gain an apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,6):\n- No apple. Options: UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6).\n- (7,6) would be empty after the move (since I moved). Safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,6):\n- No apple. Options: UP (8,7), DOWN (8,5), LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6).\n- Safe.\n\nComparing moves: UP gives an immediate apple. This is a significant advantage because it increases my score and length immediately. Longer snakes are harder to kill but also more maneuverable. At turn 0, getting the first point is good.\n\nAre there any risks with moving UP?\n- Enemy snake movement: Enemy is at (2,8). It's far. It might move towards its own apples. It might move to (3,8), (2,9), (1,8), (2,7). It's unlikely to intercept me at (7,7).\n- Head-on collision: If enemy moves to (7,7) same turn, we both die. Is that possible? Enemy starts at (2,8). To reach (7,7) in one move, it would need to move RIGHT (x+1) and DOWN (y-1). Snakes only move orthogonally (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT), not diagonally. So it cannot reach (7,7) in one turn. So no head-on collision.\n- Board boundaries: (7,7) is valid.\n- Own body: My body is empty, so no issue.\n\nThus, UP is the best move. It secures an apple and sets me up for future moves.\n\nI should also consider if there's a better apple nearby. (7,7) is the closest. (8,9) is far. (6,3) is far. So UP is optimal.\n\nMy long-term plan: Grow by eating accessible apples. Avoid tight spaces. Watch enemy movements. Since I am at (7,6) and enemy is at (2,8), I have space. I should aim to collect apples in the upper right quadrant while keeping an escape route. After eating at (7,7), I will be at (7,7) with tail at (7,6). I should then consider moving towards (8,9) or (9,4) depending on safety.\n\nFinal decision: UP.\n\nI must output exactly one word: UP.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the situation carefully. The board is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. We are at turn 2 out of 150. Our snake ID 0 is at head (7,8) and body [(7,7)], so length 2, collected 1 apple. Enemy snake #1 is at head (0,8) and body [(1,8), (2,8)], so length 3, collected 2 apples. Apples are listed: (7,1), (0,0), (9,4), (4,8), (3,0), (6,3), (2,3), (5,2), (8,9), (7,3), (1,4), (4,6), (0,3), (1,6), (8,7). That's 15 apples. The board state visual representation is given. Need to verify the coordinates and ensure we understand positions.\n\nLet's decode the board state grid. Rows 9 to 0, columns 0 to 9.\n\nRow 9: \" . . . . . . . . A .\" Means (0,9) to (9,9) horizontally? Actually the display: \n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . A .\n```\nThe leftmost column is column 0? Usually they print coordinates starting with column 0 at left. So at row 9, column 0 is '.', column 1 '.', column 2 '.', column 3 '.', column 4 '.', column 5 '.', column 6 '.', column 7 '.', column 8 'A', column 9 '.'. So (8,9) is an apple? Wait (8,9) is apple from list? Yes (8,9) is an apple. That matches: 'A' at column 8 row 9. Good.\n\nRow 8: \" 1 T T . A . . 0 . .\"\nRow 8: column 0: '1'? Actually \"1 T T . A . . 0 . .\" means column0: '1', column1: 'T', column2: 'T', column3: '.', column4: 'A', column5: '.', column6: '.', column7: '0', column8: '.', column9: '.'.\nSo (0,8): '1' -> snake #1 head? Actually snake #1 head is (0,8) as given, yes. (1,8): 'T' -> tail of snake #1? The body list says [(1,8), (2,8)] with head (0,8). So (1,8) is the first body segment (connected to head), (2,8) is the tail. In the display, (1,8) is 'T' and (2,8) is 'T'? Actually \"1 T T\" shows (0,8)=1, (1,8)=T, (2,8)=T. That matches. (4,8) is 'A' -> apple at (4,8). (7,8) is '0' -> our head. Yes.\n\nRow 7: \" . . . . . . . T A .\" Actually it says: \" . . . . . . . T A .\" Wait the line: \" . . . . . . . T A .\" That's 10 entries? Let's count: column0 '.',1 '.',2 '.',3 '.',4 '.',5 '.',6 '.',7 'T',8 'A',9 '.'. So (7,7) is 'T'? Actually (7,7) should be our body? Our body is (7,7). So (7,7) is tail of our snake? The display shows at row 7, column 7 is 'T'. That's (7,7) = tail? But our tail is (7,7) indeed. However, note that the display says \"T\" but earlier we had \"T\" used for enemy tail? Actually enemy tails are also 'T'? The board representation uses 'T' for tails? But we have both snakes: snake #0 body tail at (7,7) is shown as 'T'? That seems consistent: both snakes' body segments (except head) are represented as 'T'? But the board also has '0' for our head, '1' for enemy head. So (7,7) = 'T' is our tail. (8,7) is 'A' -> apple at (8,7). Good.\n\nRow 6: \" . A . . A . . . . .\" Actually the line: \" . A . . A . . . . .\" Wait there's 10 entries: column0 '.', column1 'A', column2 '.', column3 '.', column4 'A', column5 '.', column6 '.', column7 '.', column8 '.', column9 '.'. So apples at (1,6) and (4,6). (1,6) is in apple list? Yes (1,6) is an apple. (4,6) is also in apple list. Good.\n\nRow 5: \" . . . . . . . . . .\" No apples? But apple list includes (5,2) etc, not here.\n\nRow 4: \" . A . . . . . . . A\" Actually the line: \" . A . . . . . . . A\" So column0 '.', column1 'A', column2 '.', column3 '.', column4 '.', column5 '.', column6 '.', column7 '.', column8 '.', column9 'A'. So apples at (1,4) and (9,4). (1,4) in list? Yes (1,4) is an apple. (9,4) is an apple? Yes (9,4) is an apple. Good.\n\nRow 3: \" A . A . . . A A . .\" Actually \" A . A . . . A A . .\" That's 10: column0 'A', column1 '.', column2 'A', column3 '.', column4 '.', column5 '.', column6 'A', column7 'A', column8 '.', column9 '.'. So apples at (0,3), (2,3), (6,3), (7,3). (0,3) in list, yes. (2,3) in list, yes. (6,3) in list? Wait apple list includes (6,3)? Yes (6,3) is an apple. (7,3) is also in list. Good.\n\nRow 2: \" . . . . . A . . . .\" Actually \" . . . . . A . . . .\" So column5 'A' at (5,2). That's apple (5,2). Good.\n\nRow 1: \" . . . . . . . A . .\" Actually \" . . . . . . . A . .\" column7 'A' at (7,1). Apple (7,1). Good.\n\nRow 0: \" A . . A . . . . . .\" Actually \" A . . A . . . . . .\" So column0 'A' at (0,0), column3 'A' at (3,0). Apples (0,0) and (3,0). Good.\n\nAll apples match.\n\nNow, our snake: head at (7,8). Body: [(7,7)] (tail). So length 2, so moving one direction will result in tail moving after head? Actually typical snake: head moves, body follows, tail vacates if no growth. Since we have not grown this turn (we didn't just eat), we will move and tail will move forward (from (7,7) to somewhere) unless we eat an apple at new head location, which would keep tail? Actually growth: when head moves onto apple, the snake gains a segment, so the tail does not move; the new segment is added at the new head? Actually standard snake: head moves, body segments follow, tail stays if not grown. So if we eat, the length increases by 1, tail stays. Since we haven't eaten yet this turn, we need to decide.\n\nNow enemy snake #1: head at (0,8), body [(1,8), (2,8)] (tail at (2,8)). So length 3.\n\nNow consider possible moves for our head (7,8). Directions: UP (increase y): (7,9). DOWN: (7,7). LEFT: (6,8). RIGHT: (8,8).\n\nCheck each for immediate death:\n\n1. UP to (7,9):\n   - On board? Yes (7,9) is within 0-9.\n   - Snake body? Check if (7,9) is occupied by any snake body or tail. From board: row 9, column 7? Actually row 9 is top row: columns 0-9. At row 9, column 7? Row 9 representation: \". . . . . . . . A .\" so column7 is '.' (empty). Also apple at (8,9) is 'A', but (7,9) is empty. Snake bodies: our body is at (7,7) (tail) and maybe (7,8) head moving. Enemy body: (1,8), (2,8) at y=8, and head at (0,8). (7,9) is not occupied by enemy. So safe from immediate collision.\n   - Also check moving backwards into own body? Since our body is at (7,7) behind head (y=8). Moving up is forward, not backward, so ok.\n   - Could there be a head-on collision? Enemy may move into same cell (7,9) this turn. We need to predict enemy's move. But we can't know for sure; we can consider possibilities. Enemy is at (0,8). Possible moves: UP (0,9), DOWN (0,7), LEFT (-1,8) out of board? Actually left would be (-1,8) which is off board -> would die. So enemy cannot go left. RIGHT (1,8) but that's occupied by its own body (1,8) is its own body segment? Actually (1,8) is its first body segment (tail). If enemy moves right to (1,8), that would be into its own body, causing death. So that move is fatal. UP to (0,9) is on board and empty (row9 col0 is '.'). DOWN to (0,7) is on board; row7 col0 is '.' (empty). So enemy's safe moves are UP and DOWN. Also RIGHT is death, LEFT death. So enemy likely will move UP or DOWN. Neither leads to (7,9). So head-on collision unlikely.\n   - However, we also need to consider if moving to (7,9) could lead to future trap? Possibly but immediate safety seems fine.\n\n2. DOWN to (7,7):\n   - This is our current tail location. Moving down from head (7,8) to (7,7) would be moving directly into our own body (tail). That is considered moving backwards into your own body and you die. So this move is immediately fatal. Eliminate.\n\n3. LEFT to (6,8):\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - Check collisions: (6,8) is on board. Row 8, column 6? Row 8: \"1 T T . A . . 0 . .\" so column6 is '.'? Let's see: columns: 0:1, 1:T, 2:T, 3:., 4:A, 5:., 6:., 7:0, 8:., 9:.. So column6 is '.' (empty). Not occupied by enemy body? Enemy body at (1,8) and (2,8) only. So empty.\n   - Not our own body (only body at (7,7) and head at (7,8) moving, so (6,8) is new). So safe from immediate collision.\n   - Moving backwards? Our tail is behind at (7,7) but (6,8) is not directly behind? Actually backwards is moving from head to the cell directly behind it (i.e., (7,7)). So moving left is fine.\n   - Enemy collision possibility: Could enemy move into (6,8)? Enemy at (0,8). Possible moves: UP (0,9), DOWN (0,7), RIGHT (1,8) (death), LEFT (-1,8) death. So only UP and DOWN. None of these reach (6,8). So no head-on risk.\n   - Also check if (6,8) might be occupied by apple? Row 8, column6 is '.' as per board. So no apple.\n\n4. RIGHT to (8,8):\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - Check collisions: Row 8, column 8 is '.'? Row 8: column8 is '.' (since after 0 at col7, then col8 '.' and col9 '.'). So empty. Not enemy body. Not our own body (only (7,7) and (7,8)). So safe.\n   - No immediate death.\n   - Enemy collision? Enemy cannot move to (8,8) as discussed.\n   - Also check apple? No apple at (8,8) from list (apples are at (8,9) and (8,7) but not (8,8)).\n\nThus, from immediate safety, all moves except DOWN are safe. So we have UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow consider strategic value: we need to collect apples to grow and potentially outlast enemy. Enemy already has 2 apples vs our 1. We need to catch up.\n\nLet's list apples within reach and consider future moves. Our snake length 2, so after moving, if we eat an apple, we grow to length 3 and get +1 point. If not, length stays 2 (tail moves forward, so new body will be (7,8) if we move? Actually if we move UP to (7,9), head goes to (7,9), tail (7,7) moves to (7,8)? Wait careful: The body follows the head: after moving, the new body list becomes [old head, old body]. Since we have body [(7,7)] and head (7,8). If we move UP to (7,9), the new head is (7,9). The old head (7,8) becomes first body segment, and the old tail (7,7) becomes second body segment? But length is 2, so after moving without eating, the tail moves off (7,7) and becomes (7,8)? Actually with length 2: positions: head H, tail T. After moving, new head H', new tail becomes old H (since the tail moves forward, leaving the cell T empty). So the new body is [old H]. So our body becomes [(7,8)] if we move UP, and tail moves from (7,7) to (7,8)? Wait: Starting: H=(7,8), T=(7,7). After moving UP: H'=(7,9). The body follows: the segment that was at (7,8) moves to (7,9)? No, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the body segment at (7,7) moves to (7,8) (the previous head). So new body becomes [(7,8)] (only one segment). So the tail vacates (7,7). So after move, the snake occupies (7,9) (head) and (7,8) (body). So length remains 2. If we had eaten an apple at (7,9), we would grow by 1 segment, so the tail would not move; the new body would be [old head, old body] = [(7,8), (7,7)], length 3.\n\nSimilarly for LEFT: move to (6,8). New head (6,8), new body [(7,8)], length 2. If we eat apple at (6,8)? There is no apple at (6,8). So no growth.\n\nRIGHT: move to (8,8). No apple there.\n\nUP: move to (7,9). No apple at (7,9) (apple at (8,9) and (8,7) but not (7,9)). So no growth directly.\n\nThus, none of the safe moves immediately give us an apple. However, we might position ourselves to eat apples next turn. Let's evaluate apples near our current position and after moves.\n\nApples list: we have many apples around. The closest apples to (7,8):\n- (8,9) is an apple (top right corner). That's adjacent to (7,9) and (8,8) etc.\n- (8,7) is an apple (east of our body tail? Actually (8,7) is east of (7,7)).\n- (7,3) is an apple but far south.\n- (6,3) and (5,2) etc.\n\nAfter moving UP to (7,9), we will be at (7,9). From there, we can move to adjacent cells: (6,9), (7,8) (which will be our body), (8,9) (apple), (7,10) out of board. So we could eat (8,9) next turn by moving RIGHT, or maybe we could also go to (8,9) directly? Actually from (7,9), moving RIGHT goes to (8,9) which is an apple. That would be a safe move? But we need to consider snake body at that time: after moving to (7,9), our body will be at (7,8). So (8,9) is empty initially (apple). But we must also consider enemy. Could enemy move into (8,9) before we get there? Possibly. But we can plan.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (6,8), from there we can move to (5,8), (6,9), (7,8) (body), (6,7). Apples near: (8,7) is two steps away, (8,9) is three steps away, (7,3) far, (6,3) far. (6,8) is not near any immediate apple. But we could go to (5,8) then (4,8) which has an apple! (4,8) is an apple on row 8 column 4. That's two steps from (6,8): (5,8) then (4,8). However, need to consider that (4,8) might be occupied? Currently row 8 col 4 is 'A' (apple). Also note snake #1 is at (0,8) and its body extends to (2,8). So (4,8) is empty of snakes currently. Could enemy move towards (4,8)? Enemy is at (0,8) and may move up or down. (4,8) is to the east, but enemy's possible moves are limited; they could turn east? No, they can only move one step per turn. To reach (4,8), they'd need multiple turns. So (4,8) is relatively safe in the near term. However, we need to ensure we don't get trapped.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (8,8), from there we can move to (9,8), (8,9) (apple), (8,7) (apple), (7,8) (body). So we are adjacent to two apples: (8,9) north, (8,7) south. That's promising. (9,8) is empty (no apple). (8,9) is an apple, (8,7) is an apple. However, we must consider that after moving to (8,8), our body will be at (7,8). So from (8,8), moving UP to (8,9) would be safe if (8,9) is not occupied by enemy. Similarly moving DOWN to (8,7) might be safe. But we need to consider enemy's potential moves: could enemy reach (8,9) or (8,7) before us? Enemy is far left, at (0,8). It would take many turns to get there, but maybe they could also plan a long path. However, the board is open; they might also head to apples. We need to think about competition. The enemy has 2 apples, we have 1. They might try to eat apples too. We should try to secure apples while avoiding collisions.\n\nAnother factor: we need to avoid getting trapped. Our snake is currently at (7,8) with tail at (7,7). If we move UP, we occupy (7,9) and (7,8). From (7,9), we have only two exits: (6,9) and (8,9) (since (7,8) is body and (7,10) out). (6,9) is empty (row9 col6). (8,9) is apple. So we have two possible next moves. That's okay.\n\nIf we move LEFT, we go to (6,8) with body (7,8). Then from (6,8), exits: (5,8), (6,9), (6,7), (7,8) (body). So four possible, but (7,8) is body, so effectively three. That's good.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we go to (8,8) with body (7,8). From (8,8), exits: (9,8), (8,9), (8,7), (7,8) (body). So three viable.\n\nAll are fairly open.\n\nNow consider enemy's possible moves and potential threats. Enemy at (0,8) with body (1,8) and (2,8). They have apples at (0,0), (3,0), (4,8) (close), (0,3), (1,4), etc. They might move towards (4,8) or maybe go down to get apples like (0,0) or (3,0). Let's think about their optimal strategy. They already have 2 apples, we have 1. They might want to keep leading or grow quickly. Since the board is open, they might try to eat apples that are accessible.\n\nWe need to decide a move that maximizes our chance to eat apples while staying safe from future collisions, including potential head-on with enemy if they choose to move into the same cell we might occupy.\n\nWe also need to consider the possibility of the enemy moving into a cell we plan to occupy later. But since moves are simultaneous, we can't predict with certainty. However, we can consider worst-case: if we move to a cell that the enemy might also target, we could collide. For example, if we move UP to (7,9) and enemy moves RIGHT? But enemy cannot move RIGHT because it's into its own body. So no. If we move LEFT to (6,8), enemy cannot reach (6,8) this turn. If we move RIGHT to (8,8), enemy cannot reach (8,8). So immediate head-on collision is not possible this turn. But next turn, if we both move towards same apple, we could collide.\n\nThus, we need to plan a path to an apple that minimizes risk and also keeps options.\n\nLet's examine apple locations and distances from our current position (7,8) and after moves.\n\nApples within 2-3 steps:\n- (8,9): distance 2 if we go UP then RIGHT? Actually from (7,8) to (8,9) is Manhattan distance 2 (right 1, up 1). But we can only move one step per turn. So after moving to (7,9) we are adjacent to (8,9); after moving to (8,8) we are adjacent to (8,9) as well. So in either case, we can reach (8,9) in one more turn, but we must ensure it's not occupied when we get there.\n- (8,7): distance 2 from (7,8) (right 1, down 1). After moving to (8,8) we are adjacent; after moving to (7,9) we are two steps away? Actually from (7,9) to (8,7) is Manhattan distance 3 (right1, down2). So not as close.\n- (4,8): distance from (7,8) is 3 left (6,8), (5,8), (4,8). So three steps left.\n- (6,3) etc are far.\n\nNow, consider enemy's potential moves. They are at (0,8). They might go towards (4,8) because it's a straight line east with no obstacles? But they have their own body at (1,8) and (2,8). To move east, they would need to go RIGHT into (1,8) which is their own body -> death. So they cannot go east directly. They must first move up or down to get around their body. Their tail is at (2,8). They could move UP to (0,9) or DOWN to (0,7). Let's analyze both options:\n\n- If they move UP to (0,9): new head (0,9), body becomes [(0,8)]? Actually after moving UP, old head (0,8) becomes first body segment, and old body (1,8) and (2,8) shift: (1,8) moves to (0,8)? Wait careful: With length 3, after moving UP to (0,9), the new body becomes [old head (0,8), old first body (1,8)]? Actually snake #1 body: head (0,8), body list [(1,8), (2,8)]. After moving UP, new head (0,9). The body follows: the segment at (1,8) moves to (0,8) (the previous head), and the segment at (2,8) moves to (1,8). So new body becomes [(0,8), (1,8)], tail at (1,8) (since (2,8) is vacated). So they would occupy (0,9), (0,8), (1,8). That means (2,8) becomes empty. This could allow them to eventually go east: from (0,9) they could move RIGHT to (1,9), then maybe later down? But they need to navigate.\n\n- If they move DOWN to (0,7): new head (0,7), body becomes [(0,8), (1,8)], tail (1,8). Then they might move RIGHT later? From (0,7), moving RIGHT to (1,7) is possible, but (1,7) is currently empty (row7 col1 is '.' per board). So they could go down and then east.\n\nThus, enemy might try to reach apples like (4,8) or (0,3) or (0,0). But (4,8) is a good apple because it's on the same row, but they'd need to clear their body blockage. They could also go down to get (0,0) or (3,0). However, (0,0) is at bottom left corner, and (3,0) is also near.\n\nOur goal is to secure an apple quickly, perhaps (8,9) or (8,7) or (4,8). (8,9) is close and also a corner, might be safer from enemy because enemy is far. (8,7) is also close. (4,8) is closer to enemy, they might try to get it first. So perhaps we should aim for (8,9) or (8,7).\n\nNow, which move puts us in best position to get an apple next turn while avoiding future traps? Let's simulate each move one turn ahead, considering enemy's possible moves and apple availability.\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,9).\n- Our new state: head (7,9), body [(7,8)].\n- Apples at (8,9) is adjacent and empty (currently apple). Enemy could potentially move into (8,9) this turn? Let's see: enemy from (0,8) cannot reach (8,9) in one turn; Manhattan distance 10. So safe.\n- Next turn, we could move RIGHT to (8,9) to eat apple. But we must consider if (8,9) might become occupied by enemy by then? Enemy would need two turns to get there, so after we eat, we'd have grown, and enemy not there. However, we also need to consider if we might get trapped after eating. (8,9) is a corner; if we go there, we might be forced to go back or around. From (8,9), possible moves: (7,9) (body), (8,8) (empty), (9,9) (empty). So two open exits. That's okay. Also (9,9) is empty. So not a dead end.\n- Could we instead move to (8,9) this turn? No, we can only move one step per turn. So we need two turns to get apple (7,9 -> 8,9). That's two turns from now. Alternatively, from (7,9) we could also go to (6,9) or (7,8) but (7,8) is body, so only (6,9) or (8,9). (6,9) is empty, then we could go to (5,9) etc, maybe to (4,8) eventually. But that's longer.\n\n- Risk: After moving to (7,9), our body at (7,8). Enemy might move such that they could head towards (7,9) in the future? Possibly if they go up and then east, but that would be many turns. However, we also need to consider that the board may fill with snake bodies; we must keep options open.\n\n- Also note: There is an apple at (8,7) which is two steps away via (7,9) -> (8,9) -> (8,8) -> (8,7) but that's more steps. But we could after eating (8,9) maybe go to (8,8) then (8,7) for another apple.\n\n- However, moving UP might lead to a situation where we are on the top edge, which could limit directions if we get blocked. But currently there is no obstacle.\n\nOption 2: Move LEFT to (6,8).\n- New state: head (6,8), body [(7,8)].\n- Apples nearby: (4,8) is two steps left: (5,8) then (4,8). (8,7) is far, (8,9) far.\n- Next turn, we could move LEFT to (5,8) or UP to (6,9) or DOWN to (6,7) or RIGHT back to (7,8) (but that's body). So we have three directions: (5,8), (6,9), (6,7). (5,8) is empty (no apple). (6,9) is empty, (6,7) is empty. So we can approach (4,8) by moving LEFT twice: (5,8) then (4,8). That's two turns from now (including this move? Actually we already moved to (6,8) this turn; next turn we could move to (5,8); turn after that to (4,8). So 3 total turns to eat (4,8). However, we could also try to go to (6,7) then maybe to (5,6) etc, but less direct.\n- Enemy could also go for (4,8). If they move towards it, we might have a race. But enemy currently at (0,8). They need to clear their body blockage. If they move DOWN to (0,7) this turn, next turn they could move RIGHT to (1,7), then RIGHT to (2,7), then RIGHT to (3,7), then RIGHT to (4,7), then UP to (4,8). That's many turns. If they move UP to (0,9) this turn, then RIGHT to (1,9), then RIGHT to (2,9), then RIGHT to (3,9), then RIGHT to (4,9), then DOWN to (4,8). Also many turns. So we likely can reach (4,8) before them if we go straight left. However, we must also consider that after we eat (4,8), we grow, and we need to avoid getting trapped. (4,8) is not a corner; it's on row 8, column 4. Surrounding cells: (3,8), (5,8), (4,9), (4,7). All are empty currently (row8 col3 is '.'; row8 col5 is '.'; row9 col4 is '.'? Actually row9 col4 is '.'; row7 col4 is '.'? Let's check board: row7 col4 is '.' (row7: \" . . . . . . . T A .\" so col4 is '.'). So plenty of space.\n- However, we also need to consider that our body will be following. After moving to (6,8) this turn, body at (7,8). After moving left to (5,8) next turn, body becomes [(6,8)] and tail moves off (7,8)? Actually length remains 2, so after moving to (5,8), head (5,8), body [(6,8)], tail (7,8) becomes empty. So we will occupy (5,8) and (6,8). Then moving to (4,8) would eat apple and grow, body becomes [(5,8), (6,8)], length 3. Then we can continue.\n\n- Risk: Could enemy collide with us? They are far, unlikely. Could we run into our own body? Not if we keep moving forward.\n\nOption 3: Move RIGHT to (8,8).\n- New state: head (8,8), body [(7,8)].\n- Apples adjacent: (8,9) north, (8,7) south.\n- Next turn, we could move UP to (8,9) to eat apple (1 turn later). Or DOWN to (8,7) to eat apple. Both are safe and we can choose based on situation. That's very attractive because we can eat an apple in the next turn, gaining a point quickly. Also we can then grow and expand.\n- However, we must ensure that those apple cells are not occupied by enemy or another snake by the time we move there. As argued, enemy cannot reach (8,9) or (8,7) in one turn. So if we move RIGHT now, next turn we can eat one of them. That gives us a quick point, closing the gap (2 vs 1). After eating, we grow to length 3, and we'll be at either (8,9) or (8,7). Let's evaluate both sub-options:\n   - If we eat (8,9): head (8,9), body [(8,8), (7,8)] (since we ate, tail doesn't move). From (8,9), possible moves: (7,9), (8,8) (body), (9,9). (7,9) is empty, (9,9) empty. So two open exits. We could then go to (7,9) or (9,9). (9,9) is corner but empty, and from there we can go to (9,8) or (8,9) (body). So still okay.\n   - If we eat (8,7): head (8,7), body [(8,8), (7,8)]. From (8,7), possible moves: (9,7), (8,6), (8,8) (body), (7,7). (7,7) is currently empty? Actually (7,7) was our tail before moving; after moving RIGHT to (8,8), our body becomes [(7,8)], and (7,7) becomes empty. So (7,7) is empty. (9,7) empty, (8,6) empty. So many options.\n\n- After eating, we can plan to go for other apples. For instance, from (8,9) we could go to (7,9) then maybe (6,9) then (6,8) then (5,8) then (4,8) etc. Or from (8,7) we could go down to (8,6) etc.\n\n- Risk: Could there be a head-on collision on the next turn if enemy also moves into the same apple cell? As said, enemy can't reach (8,9) or (8,7) in one turn from (0,8). But what about the turn after that? If we eat (8,9) on turn 3, enemy might be on a path towards (8,9) by turn 4? Possibly if they head east quickly. Let's simulate enemy's fastest path to (8,9). Starting at (0,8). To reach (8,9), they need to go up to y=9, then east 8 steps. Manhattan distance 9. They could go UP to (0,9) this turn, then RIGHT to (1,9) next, RIGHT to (2,9), etc. That's 1 + 8 = 9 moves total? Actually from (0,8) to (0,9) is one move, then 8 moves east to (8,9) = 9 moves. We are at turn 2 now. If we move RIGHT this turn (turn 2), next turn (turn 3) we can eat (8,9). So we eat on turn 3. Enemy would need at least 8 more moves after turn 2 to get there, i.e., turn 10. So no conflict. Similarly for (8,7): enemy would need to go DOWN to (0,7) then east many steps, then maybe down? Actually (8,7) is y=7. Starting (0,8). To get to (8,7), they could go DOWN to (0,7) then RIGHT 8 steps = 9 moves. So same timeline. So we are safe.\n\n- Also consider that after we eat, we might have a longer body, but that's good.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT seems advantageous because it sets us up to eat an apple in the very next turn, which is efficient and helps us catch up.\n\nNow, compare to moving UP: that also sets us up to eat (8,9) in one more turn, but it takes an extra turn to get to (8,9)? Actually from (7,9) to (8,9) is one move, same as from (8,8) to (8,9) is one move. So both allow eating (8,9) on turn 3. However, moving RIGHT also gives the option to eat (8,7) on turn 3, which is equally good. So both UP and RIGHT give similar access to apples. But moving RIGHT puts us at (8,8), which is also adjacent to two apples, giving flexibility: we can choose on turn 3 which apple to eat based on enemy's move and other factors. That flexibility is valuable. Moving UP puts us at (7,9) which is adjacent only to (8,9) (and (6,9) which has no apple). So less choice.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT might keep us more central on the board, not stuck on the top edge. (8,8) is still near the edge but has three exits: up, down, left (since right would be off board? Actually right from (8,8) is (9,8) which is on board, yes (9,8) is within 0-9. So four exits: (9,8), (8,9), (8,7), (7,8). So four exits. (7,9) has three exits: (6,9), (8,9), (7,8). So (8,8) is slightly better.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6,8) gives less immediate apple access; we'd have to go two more steps to get (4,8), and other apples are farther. That might be slower.\n\nGiven the scores (enemy 2, us 1), we need to catch up. Quick apple collection is important. Also, we need to consider that the enemy might try to block or trap us later, but that's far.\n\nThus, I think RIGHT is the best move.\n\nBut we must also consider if moving RIGHT could lead to any immediate danger from enemy? No.\n\nAlso, consider the apple at (8,7) and (8,9) might be contested by the enemy in the future, but we can secure them now.\n\nOne more nuance: when we move to (8,8), our body will be at (7,8). That's fine. However, we must also consider that the enemy might move such that they could collide with our body? They are far, but later they could approach. Not a concern now.\n\nCheck if any other snake or obstacles: The board shows no other snakes. Only two snakes.\n\nThus, RIGHT seems optimal.\n\nNow, we need to output exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nBut we must also include a \"plan\" or rationale before the final move line. The instructions say: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning. You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo we should write our reasoning and plan, then end with the move.\n\nBut note: The final non-empty line must be exactly the move word, with nothing after. So we need to ensure our response ends with \"RIGHT\" on its own line, and no extra text after.\n\nWe can write the reasoning and then \"RIGHT\". But we must not have any other non-empty line after that. So we can structure:\n\n[Explanation and plan]\n\nRIGHT\n\nMake sure there is no extra spaces or punctuation after RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's craft the plan.\n\nI'll write:\n\n\"We need to catch up to the enemy's apple count (2 vs 1). Moving RIGHT to (8,8) positions us adjacent to two apples: (8,9) and (8,7). This gives us the flexibility to eat an apple on the next turn, regardless of which apple we choose. The enemy is too far to threaten those apples in the immediate future. This move also keeps our options open and maintains a safe board position. After eating, we can plan to continue gathering apples while monitoring enemy movements to avoid collisions.\"\n\nThen final line: RIGHT\n\nBut we must ensure that the plan is not too long? It's fine.\n\nAlso, we should consider if there is any risk of moving into a cell that will be occupied by the enemy's body after their move? Already considered: enemy cannot reach (8,8) this turn.\n\nDouble-check enemy's possible moves: Up to (0,9) or Down to (0,7). Neither reaches (8,8). Also, could enemy's tail move to (8,8)? No, tails move only when the snake moves, and they are at most (2,8) and (1,8). So no.\n\nThus, safe.\n\nOne more check: Could moving RIGHT cause a head-on collision if the enemy also moves right? They cannot move right into (1,8) because that's their own body, so they die. So they wouldn't choose that move if they are rational. So they will choose up or down. So no collision.\n\nThus, RIGHT is safe and strategic.\n\nNow, we need to think about the turn order: The move we choose will be executed simultaneously with the enemy's move. So we must be absolutely sure that our move does not put us into a cell that the enemy's head will move into. As we established, enemy cannot move into (8,8) this turn. So fine.\n\nNow, let's also consider that the enemy might move into (7,8) if they go right? No, they are at (0,8), so (7,8) is far.\n\nThus, final decision: RIGHT.\n\nBut wait: The last move information says our last move was UP. That doesn't affect current decision, but just note.\n\nNow, ensure we are not missing any apples that are more valuable or closer. For example, (7,3) is far. (6,3) far. (8,7) and (8,9) are both 2 steps away from current head (7,8). Moving RIGHT puts us adjacent to both, while moving UP puts us adjacent only to (8,9). So RIGHT is strictly better in terms of flexibility.\n\nAlso, (8,8) is not an apple, so no immediate gain, but setting up for next turn is efficient.\n\nThus, answer: RIGHT.\n\nNow, we need to produce the response.We need to catch up to the enemy's apple count (2 vs 1). Moving RIGHT to (8,8) positions us adjacent to two apples: (8,9) and (8,7). This gives us the flexibility to eat an apple on the next turn, regardless of which apple we choose. The enemy is too far to threaten those apples in the immediate future. This move also keeps our options open and maintains a safe board position. After eating, we can plan to continue gathering apples while monitoring enemy movements to avoid collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait the last move information says: \"Your last move information: RIGHT\". That indicates that on turn 2 we moved RIGHT? Actually turn 2 we were at head (8,8) after moving RIGHT? Let's re-read the initial state. At start of turn 3, we have:\n\nHead: (8,8), Body: [(7,8)], Apples collected: 1.\n\nThe last move information says: \"START LAST MOVE PICK RIGHT END LAST MOVE PICK\" and \"START LAST RATIONALE ...\". That is the move we made on turn 2? Actually we need to be careful: The state is given for turn 3, and the last move we made (presumably on turn 2) was RIGHT, which moved us from (7,8) to (8,8). Yes, because at turn 2 we had head (7,8) and body (7,7). After moving RIGHT, head becomes (8,8), body becomes [(7,8)] (since the tail (7,7) moves forward to (7,8)? Actually wait: If we moved from (7,8) to (8,8) on turn 2, our previous body was (7,7). After moving, the head moves to (8,8), the body becomes (7,8) (the previous head) and the tail (7,7) disappears? But we have body list [(7,8)] after the move. That matches: head (8,8), body (7,8). So indeed we moved RIGHT from (7,8) to (8,8) on turn 2. Good.\n\nNow at turn 3, we need to decide a new move. Let's re-evaluate the board and our positions. Apples are as before, but note: Did we eat an apple on the previous move? No, because (8,8) was empty (according to board row 8 col 8 is '.'), and we have only 1 apple total. So no growth.\n\nEnemy snake #1: head at (0,8), body [(1,8), (2,8)]. Apples: 2.\n\nNow we need to think about our next move. Our current head (8,8). Possible moves: UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), LEFT (7,8), RIGHT (9,8).\n\nCheck each for immediate danger:\n\n- UP (8,9): On board? Yes. Check occupancy: Row 9, col 8 is 'A' (apple). That is an apple! So moving UP would eat the apple at (8,9), which is one of the apples we identified as reachable. That would give us +1 apple (total 2) and also cause growth: we would not lose our tail, so our length would become 3. However, we must check if moving UP is safe from collisions. (8,9) is not occupied by any snake body currently: our body is at (7,8) only; enemy body at (1,8),(2,8); enemy head at (0,8). No snake occupies (8,9). So immediate collision safe. But we must consider enemy movement: Could enemy's head move into (8,9) on this turn? Enemy is at (0,8). To reach (8,9) in one move is impossible (distance > 1). So no head-on collision. However, could enemy's body extend into (8,9)? Not in one move; bodies move as the snake moves, but they only occupy new cells after the move. Enemy's head moves, then body follows; the tail may vacate. But (8,9) is far, so impossible. So moving UP is safe and yields an apple.\n\n- DOWN (8,7): On board? Yes. (8,7) is an apple (from board: row7 col8 is 'A'). So also an apple! So moving DOWN would also eat an apple at (8,7). That would give us +1 apple and growth. Check collisions: (8,7) is not currently occupied by any snake body. Enemy body at (1,8),(2,8) far. So safe. Enemy cannot reach (8,7) in one move either (distance 8+?). So safe.\n\n- LEFT (7,8): On board? Yes. (7,8) is currently our body (tail). Moving LEFT would move head into the cell occupied by our own body (7,8). That is moving into your own body, which results in death. So LEFT is fatal. Eliminate.\n\n- RIGHT (9,8): On board? Yes. (9,8) is row8 col9. According to board row8: columns 0-9: 0:1,1:T,2:T,3:.,4:A,5:.,6:.,7:0,8:.,9:.. So (9,8) is '.' (empty). Not an apple. No immediate apple. Check collisions: Not occupied by any snake. Enemy cannot reach (9,8) in one move. So safe but no immediate apple.\n\nThus, we have three safe moves: UP (eats (8,9)), DOWN (eats (8,7)), RIGHT (no apple). Which is best? Both UP and DOWN give an immediate apple, increasing score to 2, matching the enemy's apple count (enemy has 2). Both are safe. Need to consider long-term implications: which apple position offers better future opportunities and safety?\n\nLet's examine the board and apple locations after we eat one of them.\n\nFirst, list all apples again: (7,1), (0,0), (9,4), (4,8), (3,0), (6,3), (2,3), (5,2), (8,9), (7,3), (1,4), (4,6), (0,3), (1,6), (8,7). We are adjacent to two apples: (8,9) and (8,7). Eating either will remove that apple from the board. The remaining apples: many. But note that there is also an apple at (4,8) which is on same y-level (y=8) at x=4. That might be reachable later.\n\nConsider the body after eating. If we eat UP (to (8,9)), our new head will be (8,9), body becomes [(8,8), (7,8)]? Actually after eating, we grow: the tail does not move. So before move: head (8,8), body [(7,8)]. After moving UP and eating apple: new head (8,9). Since we ate, we do not remove tail; we keep all segments. The new body becomes: previous head (8,8) becomes new body segment, and previous body (7,8) remains as the second segment? Actually snake growth: The new head moves to new cell, the previous head becomes the first body segment, and all other body segments shift but tail stays if not grown? Wait typical snake: if you eat, you gain one segment; so the body length increases by 1. The transformation: new head at target, the old head becomes new body segment, and all previous body segments shift forward, but the tail stays. So if length was 2 (head + one body), after eating we have length 3: head, old head, old body (tail). So after eating UP: head (8,9), body = [(8,8), (7,8)] (the first body segment is the previous head, second is previous tail). That means our body will occupy (8,8) and (7,8). Similarly, after eating DOWN (to (8,7)): head (8,7), body = [(8,8), (7,8)]? Wait careful: if we move DOWN from (8,8) to (8,7), that's a movement; we need to compute new body positions. Before move: head (8,8), body [(7,8)]. After moving to (8,7) and eating, the body becomes: previous head (8,8) becomes first body segment, previous body (7,8) becomes second body segment (tail). So same body positions: (8,8) and (7,8). But note: (7,8) is currently our body; after moving DOWN, we will have left (8,8) and (7,8) as body. However, (7,8) was our tail before move; after moving, if we ate, tail stays at (7,8) because we grew, so (7,8) remains as tail. That is fine.\n\nIf we move RIGHT (to (9,8) and no apple), then we do not grow. So new head (9,8), body becomes [(8,8)] (since tail moves forward? Actually if no growth, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains 2? Wait length 2: head and one body. After moving, the head moves, and the tail moves to the previous head? Standard snake: head moves, body follows, tail moves forward. So if we have head (8,8) and body [(7,8)], after moving RIGHT without eating: new head (9,8), new body = [(8,8)] (the old head becomes body, and the old tail (7,8) moves forward to (8,8)? Actually need to be precise: The snake consists of segments: head at (8,8), body at (7,8). When the head moves to a new cell, the body segments shift: the segment that was at (8,8) moves to become the new first body segment? Actually the body segments are ordered from head to tail. The head moves first; the body follows: each segment takes the position of the previous segment. So the previous head becomes the new first body segment; the previous first body segment becomes the second body segment, etc. But here we only have one body segment. After moving without growth, the tail does not stay; it moves forward, so the snake length stays the same. So the new head is (9,8). The old head (8,8) becomes the new first body segment. The old body segment (7,8) becomes the new tail? Actually the old body segment (7,8) moves to the position of the previous segment? Since there is only one body segment, after movement, the body segment that was at (7,8) moves to (8,8)? Wait we need to think stepwise: The snake's segments are linked. The head moves to (9,8). The segment that was at (8,8) (the old head) now becomes the first body segment. The segment that was at (7,8) (the old tail) now moves to (8,8) because it follows the head? Actually the body follows the head's path. The old tail (7,8) will move to the position previously occupied by the head? Not exactly: Each body segment moves to the position of the segment ahead of it. So after head moves to (9,8), the first body segment (which was at (8,8)) moves to (9,8)? No, that would cause collision with the new head? Actually the head moves first; then the body moves into the head's old position. The tail moves into the previous body's position. So typical snake movement without growth: head moves to new cell; the segment that was the head becomes the first body segment; the segment that was the first body segment becomes the second body segment; and the tail moves forward, possibly disappearing if no growth. In a length-2 snake, after moving without growth, the head moves, the body moves to the old head's position, and the tail disappears (since length stays 2). So new snake: head (9,8), body (8,8). The tail (7,8) is vacated. That's correct: because we didn't grow, the length remains 2, so the tail segment moves forward and becomes the new body, and the old tail disappears. Actually need to check: In a snake of length 2 (head + one body), the body is the tail. After moving without eating, the head moves, the body moves into the head's old position, and the tail (which is the body) moves forward, but since there is no segment behind it, the tail vacates its previous position? Wait the body is the tail; when the snake moves, the tail moves to the position of the head? I'm mixing.\n\nBetter to think of the snake as a queue. At start: positions: head = (8,8), body = (7,8) (tail). When moving, we dequeue the tail (remove it) and enqueue a new head at the new position, unless we eat an apple (in which case we skip dequeuing). So without eating: we remove the tail (7,8) and add new head (9,8). So new positions: head (9,8), body = (8,8). So indeed the tail moves away, and (7,8) becomes empty. So after moving RIGHT, our body will be at (8,8), and (7,8) becomes empty.\n\nNow, after eating (UP or DOWN), we do not remove the tail, so we keep (7,8) as a body segment. So both eating options leave (7,8) occupied, while non-eating vacates it.\n\nNow we need to consider future moves and trapping. Also need to consider enemy's potential moves and potential interactions.\n\nWe should also consider that eating an apple now might lead to a situation where we become longer and possibly more constrained. But given the board is relatively open, and we are at the edge (top-right corner), length 2 is small; growing to 3 is not a big issue. However, if we eat UP to (8,9), we are at the top edge (y=9). From there, possible moves next turn: DOWN (back to (8,8) which would be occupied by our body? Actually after eating UP, body is [(8,8), (7,8)]. So (8,8) is now a body segment. So if we are at (8,9), moving DOWN would move head to (8,8) which is our own body -> death. So we would not be able to go DOWN directly. Other moves from (8,9): LEFT (7,9), RIGHT (9,9). UP would go out of board? (8,10) is out of range (y max 9), so UP is invalid. So from (8,9), we have only LEFT and RIGHT as safe moves (provided they are not occupied). Also, we could consider that after eating UP, we might want to go LEFT or RIGHT to continue exploring. But (7,9) is empty? Row9 col7 is '.' (from board row9: col7 is '.'; col8 is 'A' originally but we will eat it; after eating, (8,9) becomes head, and that apple is removed). (9,9) is row9 col9? Row9 col9 is '.' (since row9: columns: 0-7: '.', 8: 'A', 9: '.'). So (9,9) is empty. So both LEFT and RIGHT are possible. However, we must also consider that after eating, we have a body segment at (8,8) and (7,8). So (8,8) is occupied. That might block certain paths later.\n\nNow consider eating DOWN to (8,7). That puts head at (8,7). From there, possible moves: UP (back to (8,8) which is a body segment -> death), DOWN (8,6), LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7). Also note (8,6) is row6 col8? Row6: \". A . . A . . . . .\" so col8 is '.' (empty). (7,7) is row7 col7? Row7: col7 is 'T'? Wait row7: \" . . . . . . . T A .\" Actually row7 has: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 '.', col5 '.', col6 '.', col7 'T', col8 'A', col9 '.'. So (7,7) is 'T' which is the tail of snake #1? No, snake #1 tail is at (2,8) and (1,8). That's not (7,7). The 'T' at (7,7) is actually our own tail? Wait, our own body after eating DOWN: head (8,7), body = [(8,8), (7,8)]? Actually after eating DOWN, our body segments are (8,8) and (7,8). (7,7) is not part of our body. However, the board shows at (7,7) a 'T'. Which snake is that? Let's re-examine the board. Row 7 (y=7) has: \" . . . . . . . T A .\" So at (7,7) there is a 'T'. That is likely the tail of snake #1? But snake #1 body is at (1,8) and (2,8) according to given data. The board also shows 'T' at (1,8) and (2,8) on row8. So row7 col7 'T' is not snake #1. Could it be some other snake? There are only two snakes. Could it be our own tail? At the start of turn 3, our body is only (7,8). (7,7) is not occupied by us. But the board shows 'T' there. That suggests there is another snake tail? Wait maybe there is a third snake? The initial description only mentions \"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game.\" and gives enemy snake #1. But the board might have more than two snakes? Actually the board representation uses 'T' for tails of any snake. We have snake #0 and snake #1. The 'T' at (7,7) must be snake #1's tail? But snake #1's tail is at (2,8) and (1,8) from the data. Let's double-check the enemy snake data: \"Snake #1 - Head: (0, 7), Body: [(0, 8), (1, 8)], Apples: 2\". Wait there's a discrepancy: In the initial description at the start of the problem, enemy snake #1 is listed as head (0,8) and body [(0,8), (1,8)]? Actually let's read carefully: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #1 - Head: (0, 7), Body: [(0, 8), (1, 8)], Apples: 2\". That says head (0,7), body [(0,8), (1,8)]. But earlier in the board analysis, I saw head at (0,8) and body at (1,8),(2,8). That's from the board visualization. Let's re-extract the enemy snake data from the problem statement:\n\nThe initial prompt says:\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head: (0, 7), Body: [(0, 8), (1, 8)], Apples: 2\n\nBut the board state shows row 8: \"1 T T . A . . 0 . .\" which indicates at (0,8) is '1', at (1,8) is 'T', at (2,8) is 'T'. So according to the board, snake #1 head is at (0,8) and body at (1,8) and (2,8). That contradicts the listed enemy snake data. Which is correct? The problem says \"Use only the game state provided.\" The game state includes both the text description of enemy snakes and the board visualization. There's an inconsistency. Let's read the initial description again:\n\n\"Enemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head: (0, 7), Body: [(0, 8), (1, 8)], Apples: 2\"\n\nWait, maybe I mis-copied. Let's look back at the problem text: I'm reading the initial prompt. It says:\n\n\"Your snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (8, 8)\n  - Body: [(7, 8)]\n  - Apples collected: 1\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head: (0, 7), Body: [(0, 8), (1, 8)], Apples: 2\"\n\nYes, that's what it says. But the board visualization shows row 8 (y=8) with \"1 T T ...\" which would place head at (0,8) if column 0 is 1. However, note that the coordinate system: y=8 is the row labeled 8. In the board visualization, the row labels are the y-coordinate. So row 8 corresponds to y=8. So indeed (0,8) is shown as '1'. So the enemy head is at (0,8), not (0,7). This is a discrepancy. Perhaps the enemy data is wrong? Or maybe the board representation uses a different orientation? The board is shown with y decreasing from top to bottom? Actually the board shows rows 9 to 0 from top to bottom. That's consistent: y=9 at top, y=0 at bottom. So row 8 is y=8. So (0,8) is as seen. So the enemy head is at (0,8). But the text says (0,7). Could be a typo? Let's see the body list: Body: [(0,8), (1,8)]. That matches the board: at (0,8) is the head? Wait body list includes (0,8) and (1,8). But if head is at (0,7), then body includes (0,8) and (1,8). That would mean the body segments are at (0,8) and (1,8) and the head at (0,7). But the board shows '1' at (0,8), which is likely the head. Usually they denote head with the snake number. So I think the board is authoritative. So we should trust the board visualization. Possibly the text had a mistake: Head should be (0,8) and body [(1,8), (2,8)]? Actually the board shows at (1,8) 'T' and (2,8) 'T', so body should be (1,8) and (2,8). But the text says body [(0,8), (1,8)] which would put (0,8) as a body segment and head at (0,7). That would conflict with board. So it's likely a typo in the text. Let's examine the board more carefully: Row 8: \"1 T T . A . . 0 . .\" So column0:1 (head), column1:T (body), column2:T (body). That's snake #1. So head (0,8), body (1,8) and (2,8). That seems correct. The text says body [(0,8), (1,8)]; maybe they misordered? Possibly they intended head (0,8) and body [(1,8),(2,8)] but wrote incorrectly. However, the apples count: enemy has 2 apples, we have 1. That's consistent.\n\nGiven the board is the visual representation, we should use that. So we'll assume enemy snake #1 has head (0,8) and body (1,8), (2,8). That matches the board.\n\nNow, back to the 'T' at (7,7) on row7. That is puzzling. Let's list all non-empty cells on the board based on the visualization:\n\nRow 9: (8,9) = A\nRow 8: (0,8)=1, (1,8)=T, (2,8)=T, (4,8)=A, (7,8)=0 (our head)\nRow 7: (7,7)=T, (8,7)=A\nRow 6: (1,6)=A, (4,6)=A\nRow 5: (none)\nRow 4: (1,4)=A, (9,4)=A\nRow 3: (0,3)=A, (2,3)=A, (6,3)=A, (7,3)=A\nRow 2: (5,2)=A\nRow 1: (7,1)=A\nRow 0: (0,0)=A, (3,0)=A\n\nNow, where are the snake tails? Our snake tail is at (7,8) (since body list is [(7,8)]). But the board shows (7,8) as '0'? Wait row 8 column 7 is '0' (our head). So (7,8) is actually our head? No, our head is at (8,8) according to the current state. Wait there's confusion. The current state at turn 3 says head (8,8), body [(7,8)]. But the board shows row 8: ... column 7 is '0'. That would be (7,8) if column 7 is 7? Actually column indices: we need to map the string exactly.\n\nLet's write the row strings with indices:\n\nRow 9: \" . . . . . . . . A .\"\nIndices: 0: . ,1: . ,2: . ,3: . ,4: . ,5: . ,6: . ,7: . ,8: A ,9: . \n\nRow 8: \" 1 T T . A . . 0 . .\"\nIndices: 0:1 ,1:T ,2:T ,3:. ,4:A ,5:. ,6:. ,7:0 ,8:. ,9:.\n\nRow 7: \" . . . . . . . T A .\"\nIndices: 0:. ,1:. ,2:. ,3:. ,4:. ,5:. ,6:. ,7:T ,8:A ,9:.\n\nRow 6: \" . A . . A . . . . .\"\nIndices: 0:. ,1:A ,2:. ,3:. ,4:A ,5:. ,6:. ,7:. ,8:. ,9:.\n\nRow 5: \" . . . . . . . . . .\"\nAll dots.\n\nRow 4: \" . A . . . . . . . A\"\nIndices: 0:. ,1:A ,2:. ,3:. ,4:. ,5:. ,6:. ,7:. ,8:. ,9:A\n\nRow 3: \" A . A . . . A A . .\"\nIndices: 0:A ,1:. ,2:A ,3:. ,4:. ,5:. ,6:A ,7:A ,8:. ,9:.\n\nRow 2: \" . . . . . A . . . .\"\nIndices: 0:. ,1:. ,2:. ,3:. ,4:. ,5:A ,6:. ,7:. ,8:. ,9:.\n\nRow 1: \" . . . . . . . A . .\"\nIndices: 0:. ,1:. ,2:. ,3:. ,4:. ,5:. ,6:. ,7:A ,8:. ,9:.\n\nRow 0: \" A . . A . . . . . .\"\nIndices: 0:A ,1:. ,2:. ,3:A ,4:. ,5:. ,6:. ,7:. ,8:. ,9:.\n\nNow, our current state: head (8,8) and body [(7,8)]. But the board shows at (8,8) row 8 column 8? Row8 column8 is '.' (empty). That's inconsistent. Our head should be at (8,8) but board shows '.' there. And our body at (7,8) would be row8 column7, which is '0' (head). That suggests the board might reflect the state before our move? Let's check: At turn 3, after our move on turn 2 (RIGHT), we moved from (7,8) to (8,8). So after the move, our head is at (8,8) and body at (7,8). However, the board visualization might be the state at the beginning of turn 3? The problem states \"Board state:\" and then the grid. That should be the current board at the start of this turn. But according to our state, our head is at (8,8). Yet the board shows (8,8) as '.' and (7,8) as '0'. That indicates the board is from before our move? Or maybe the board is after all moves on turn 2? Let's think: The turn count is 3 / 150. The last move information says we moved RIGHT. That move was executed on turn 2. The board state provided at turn 3 should reflect the situation after turn 2 (i.e., current). But there is a mismatch.\n\nMaybe the board is using a different coordinate labeling? The board shows row 8 with a '0' at column 7. That could be our head if we are at (7,8). But our state says head (8,8). Which is correct? Let's re-examine the initial state at turn 3: It says \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (8, 8) Body: [(7, 8)]\". That is explicit. The board visualization must be consistent with that, but it's not. Perhaps I misread the board rows: Maybe the rows are printed with y increasing from top to bottom? Usually in these problems, row 9 is top, row 0 is bottom. That's standard. So (8,8) is at row8 column8. Row8 column8 is '.' in the board. So not '0'. So the board does not show our head at (8,8). Therefore, either the board is outdated or my interpretation of column indices is off.\n\nLet's look at the row strings again: Row 8 is \" 1 T T . A . . 0 . .\". There are 10 characters. The last character is '.'? Actually the string ends with a dot? It says \"0 . .\" So after \"0\" there is a space then dot? The formatting might have spaces between characters. The representation: \" 1 T T . A . . 0 . .\" So likely the characters are separated by spaces. So the sequence is: column0: '1', column1: 'T', column2: 'T', column3: '.', column4: 'A', column5: '.', column6: '.', column7: '0', column8: '.', column9: '.'. So indeed (7,8) is '0'. That would be our head if we are at (7,8). But the state says we are at (8,8). So maybe the state is after our move on turn 3? No, turn 3 is the current turn; we haven't moved yet. So our head should be at (8,8) as given. But the board shows (8,8) as '.' and (7,8) as '0'. So the board seems to reflect the state at the beginning of turn 3? But the beginning of turn 3 is after the enemy move on turn 2? Actually the game proceeds: turn 1: initial state. Turn 2: we made a move (RIGHT). The enemy also moved on turn 2. After both moves, the board updates. Then turn 3 starts, and we are presented with the board state after turn 2. So the board should reflect positions after turn 2. Our state after turn 2 should be head (8,8) and body (7,8). But the board shows (8,8) as '.' and (7,8) as '0'. That suggests that maybe the board is from before our move on turn 2? That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the board is printed with the snake heads marked by the snake number, but our head is at (8,8) and we are snake 0. The board shows '0' at (7,8). Could it be that the board is misaligned due to spaces? Maybe the column indices are 0-9 but the printed string might have an extra space at the beginning? Let's look at the original text: \n\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . A .\n 8 T T . . A . . T 0 .\n 7 1 . . . . . . . A .\n 6 . A . . A . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . A . . . . . . . A\n 3 A . A . . . A A . .\n 2 . . . . . A . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . A . .\n 0 A . . A . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nWait, there is a discrepancy in row 8: It says \" 8 T T . . A . . T 0 .\" Actually I think the row 8 string is \" 8 T T . . A . . T 0 .\" but earlier I had \" 8 T T . A . . 0 . .\"? Let's re-copy exactly from the problem statement:\n\n```\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . . A .\n 8 T T . . A . . T 0 .\n 7 1 . . . . . . . A .\n 6 . A . . A . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . A . . . . . . . A\n 3 A . A . . . A A . .\n 2 . . . . . A . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . A . .\n 0 A . . A . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nI see! Row 8: \" 8 T T . . A . . T 0 .\" So there are spaces, and the characters: after \"8\" there is a space? Actually the line starts with \" 8\" then a space then \"T\" then space then \"T\" then space then \".\" then space then \".\" then space then \"A\" then space then \".\" then space then \".\" then space then \"T\" then space then \"0\" then space then \".\". Let's parse:\n\n- Column 0: T? Wait we need to align with the bottom number line \"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\". That suggests the first character after the row label is column 0. So row 8: after the label \"8\", the next character is a space? The string is \" 8 T T . . A . . T 0 .\". Actually it's \" 8 T T . . A . . T 0 .\". So after the label, there is a space, then 'T', then space, then 'T', then space, then '.', then space, then '.', then space, then 'A', then space, then '.', then space, then '.', then space, then 'T', then space, then '0', then space, then '.'. So the sequence of symbols (ignoring spaces) is: T, T, ., ., A, ., ., T, 0, .? That would be 10 symbols? Let's count: 1.T, 2.T, 3., 4., 5.A, 6., 7., 8.T, 9.0, 10.. Yes 10. So the columns 0-9: col0: T, col1: T, col2: ., col3: ., col4: A, col5: ., col6: ., col7: T, col8: 0, col9: . . That is different from my earlier parsing! I had earlier: 1 T T . A . . 0 . . but actually it's T T . . A . . T 0 . . Wait the row starts with \"T\" not \"1\". So (0,8) is 'T', not '1'. But the enemy head is supposed to be snake #1. Where is '1'? Look at row 7: \" 7 1 . . . . . . . A .\" So row 7 has a '1' at column 0. That is (0,7) = '1'. So enemy head is at (0,7)! That matches the enemy data: Head: (0,7). And body: [(0,8), (1,8)]? Let's check: Row 8 has 'T' at col0 and col1. So (0,8) and (1,8) are both 'T'. That could be the body of snake #1. The body list given is [(0,8), (1,8)]. Yes! So snake #1 body includes (0,8) and (1,8). The tail is at (1,8) and the other segment at (0,8) is the one next to head? Actually the head is at (0,7), so the body segments are at (0,8) and (1,8). That makes sense: head (0,7) connects to (0,8) which connects to (1,8) as tail. That matches the board: (0,8) is T, (1,8) is T. Good! So our earlier misreading was due to incorrect parsing. The board is consistent: head of snake #1 at (0,7) (row 7 col 0), body at (0,8) and (1,8) (row 8 col0 and col1). So the board matches the enemy data.\n\nNow, our snake: head (8,8) and body (7,8). On row 8, col8 is '0'? Let's see row 8: after parsing, col8 is '0'? Actually from the row 8 string: after \"T 0 .\", the '0' is at col8? Let's index the symbols properly:\n\nRow 8 symbols (positions 0-9):\n- Symbol at position 0: 'T' (from the first 'T')\n- Position 1: 'T' (second 'T')\n- Position 2: '.' (first dot)\n- Position 3: '.' (second dot)\n- Position 4: 'A'\n- Position 5: '.' (third dot)\n- Position 6: '.' (fourth dot)\n- Position 7: 'T'\n- Position 8: '0'\n- Position 9: '.'\n\nSo (0,8) is 'T' (snake #1 body), (1,8) 'T' (body), (7,8) 'T'? Actually position 7 is 'T', that is (7,8) is 'T'. But that would be a snake body? Our body is supposed to be at (7,8). So (7,8) is 'T'. That matches our body! Because our body is a tail, represented as 'T'. So (7,8) is our tail. And our head is at (8,8) which is '0'. That matches! So the board shows: (7,8) = 'T' (our tail), (8,8) = '0' (our head). Yes! So everything is consistent: our head at (8,8) is '0', our tail at (7,8) is 'T'. Good. So earlier confusion resolved.\n\nNow, we have accurate positions: Our head (8,8), body (7,8). Enemy head (0,7), body (0,8) and (1,8). Good.\n\nNow, back to decision for turn 3. We need to choose a move.\n\nWe identified safe moves: UP (8,9) which is an apple (A at (8,9)), DOWN (8,7) which is an apple (A at (8,7)), RIGHT (9,8) no apple, LEFT (7,8) fatal (into own body). So UP and DOWN are both safe and give an apple. Which is better?\n\nWe must consider enemy movement. Enemy at (0,7) can move: possible directions: UP (0,8) but (0,8) is occupied by its own body (segment at (0,8)). That would be moving into its own body -> death. So UP is fatal for enemy. DOWN (0,6) is on board and likely empty? Row6 col0 is '.' (empty). LEFT (-1,7) out of board -> death. RIGHT (1,7) is on board; row7 col1 is '.'? Row7: \"1 . . . . . . . A .\" so col1 is '.' (empty). So enemy's safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT. Also possibly UP if they consider moving into their own body? No, that's death. So they will likely move either DOWN to (0,6) or RIGHT to (1,7). They might also consider moving up if they are suicidal? No, rational snake will avoid death. So we assume enemy moves to either (0,6) or (1,7). Neither of these threatens us directly. However, we need to also consider that enemy might move into a cell that we also move into? No, they are far away.\n\nThus, both UP and DOWN are safe regarding enemy collision.\n\nNow, long-term strategy: After eating, we need to consider future moves and potential trapping. Let's examine each option.\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (8,9) and eat apple.\n- New head: (8,9). New body: (8,8) and (7,8) (since we grow). So body occupies (8,8) and (7,8). Note that (8,8) is directly below head; (7,8) is left of (8,8).\n- Next turn, from (8,9), possible moves: DOWN would go to (8,8) which is our own body -> death. So DOWN is not allowed. LEFT to (7,9) is possible; RIGHT to (9,9) possible; UP is out of board. So only LEFT or RIGHT. So we have only two safe moves from there, both along the top edge. That's somewhat limiting. Also, note that (7,9) and (9,9) are both empty. But we need to consider apples: after eating (8,9), remaining apples include (8,7) still there, (4,8), (9,4), etc. From (8,9), we cannot reach (8,7) directly because we are blocked by our own body? Actually we could go LEFT to (7,9), then DOWN to (7,8) but (7,8) is our body (tail) and would be occupied; however, by the time we move, the body might shift. But if we move LEFT to (7,9), then the body will shift: head (7,9), body becomes (8,9) and (8,8)? Actually after eating UP, body is (8,8) and (7,8). If we then move LEFT to (7,9) without eating, the head moves to (7,9), and the body shifts: new body = [(8,9), (8,8)]? Wait careful: Starting at (8,9) head, body = [(8,8), (7,8)]. If we move LEFT (no apple), head goes to (7,9). The old head (8,9) becomes first body segment; the first body segment (8,8) becomes second body; the tail (7,8) moves forward? Actually we need to update the queue. The snake length is 3. Without eating, we dequeue the tail (7,8) and enqueue new head (7,9). So new positions: head (7,9), body = [(8,9), (8,8)]. So (7,8) becomes empty. So from (7,9), the cell (7,8) is now empty. So we could then move DOWN to (7,8) (which is empty) if needed. So it's not permanently blocked. But the immediate limitation is only two moves from (8,9). However, (8,9) is a corner; we could move LEFT or RIGHT. If we go LEFT to (7,9), we have more options. But still, the corner might be less flexible.\n\nOption 2: Move DOWN to (8,7) and eat apple.\n- New head: (8,7). New body: (8,8) and (7,8) (same as above). So body occupies (8,8) and (7,8). Note that (8,8) is above head; (7,8) is left of (8,8).\n- From (8,7), possible moves: UP would go to (8,8) which is our own body -> death. So UP is fatal. LEFT to (7,7) is possible? (7,7) is currently occupied by 'T'? From board row7 col7 is 'T'. That's which snake? Row7: \"1 . . . . . . . A .\" so col7 is 'A'? Wait row7 string: \" 7 1 . . . . . . . A .\" Let's re-parse row 7 accurately:\n\nRow 7: \" 7 1 . . . . . . . A .\" Actually the line: \" 7 1 . . . . . . . A .\" But earlier I thought row 7 had \"1 . . . . . . . A .\". Let's copy exactly from problem:\n\n```\n 7 1 . . . . . . . A .\n```\n\nSo symbols: col0: '1' (enemy head), col1: '.', col2: '.', col3: '.', col4: '.', col5: '.', col6: '.', col7: '.', col8: 'A', col9: '.'? Wait there are 10 symbols? Let's count: after \"7\" there is a space, then '1', then space, then '.', then space, then '.', then space, then '.', then space, then '.', then space, then '.', then space, then '.', then space, then '.', then space, then 'A', then space, then '.'? That would be many symbols. Actually we need to parse with the bottom coordinate line. The bottom line shows \"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\". So the first character after the row label is column 0. So for row 7, column 0 is '1'. Column 1 is '.' (since after '1' there is a dot). Column 2 is '.'? Let's reconstruct row 7 string: \" 7 1 . . . . . . . A .\" I see that after \"7\", there is a space, then \"1\", then space, then \".\", then space, then \".\", then space, then \".\", then space, then \".\", then space, then \".\", then space, then \".\", then space, then \"A\", then space, then \".\". That's 10 symbols: positions 0:1, 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:. . So (7,7) is column 7, which is '.' (empty). Good. So (7,7) is empty. So from (8,7), moving LEFT to (7,7) is safe (empty). Also moving DOWN to (8,6) is safe (row6 col8 is '.'), moving RIGHT to (9,7) is safe (row7 col9 is '.'). So from (8,7), we have three safe moves: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. That's more flexible than from (8,9) which had only two moves (LEFT, RIGHT). Also, (8,7) is closer to other apples? (7,3) is south, (8,1) maybe? But we can explore.\n\nAdditionally, note that if we eat DOWN, we will have an apple at (8,7) removed, leaving (8,9) still available. If we eat UP, (8,9) removed, (8,7) still available. Both are similar. However, from (8,7), we might have a more open area: left side (7,7) leads to a region with apple at (7,3) and (6,3) etc. Also, (8,7) is one step away from (7,7) and (8,6). From (8,9), we are at the top edge, which might be more restricted in the long run. Also, moving DOWN puts us closer to the center of the board where more apples are located (like (7,3), (6,3), (5,2), etc). Moving UP takes us to the top corner, farther from other apples.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN seems strategically better for future flexibility and apple collection.\n\nBut we also need to consider the enemy's potential growth. They have 2 apples, we have 1. If we eat now, we tie at 2. That's good. If we don't eat, we stay at 1, they might continue to outpace us. So eating is important.\n\nThus, I think DOWN is the best move.\n\nBut wait, we must also consider that moving DOWN to (8,7) and eating the apple there might be contested by the enemy? Could the enemy move to (8,7) on the same turn? The enemy is at (0,7). To move to (8,7) in one turn is impossible (distance 8). So no risk.\n\nNow, what about the apple at (4,8) and (9,4) and others? We'll plan to collect them later.\n\nThus, our move should be DOWN.\n\nBut before finalizing, double-check safety: (8,7) is an apple, so we will grow. That means our tail will not move, so the cell (7,8) will remain occupied by our tail (since we keep it). However, note that after eating, our body will be (8,8) and (7,8). (7,8) is currently occupied by our tail, which is fine. But is there any risk that the enemy might move into (7,8) on this turn? The enemy is far away, so no. So safe.\n\nAlso, we must ensure that moving DOWN does not cause a head-on collision with the enemy if they also move into (8,7). Impossible. So safe.\n\nThus, DOWN is the optimal move.\n\nNow, we need to output our move. The final non-empty line must be exactly one word: DOWN.\n\nBut we should also consider if there is any other nuance: The last move was RIGHT. That's fine.\n\nWe could also think about a longer-term plan: After eating DOWN to (8,7), we will have head (8,7), body (8,8) and (7,8). Next turn, we can explore leftwards or down to gather more apples while avoiding getting trapped. We should also keep an eye on enemy movements; they are on the left side and may try to cut us off. We need to stay away from them and collect apples efficiently.\n\nI'll write a short plan in the rationale, but the final answer is DOWN.\n\nNow, ensure that the response format includes the plan and then the move. The instructions say: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\" So we need to include our reasoning and plan before the final move. But the final move must be a single word on its own line. We'll produce a response with reasoning and then \"DOWN\".We need to maximize growth while maintaining flexibility. Moving DOWN to (8,7) eats an apple, ties our score with the enemy (2-2), and keeps us closer to the central apples for future collection. From (8,7), we retain three safe exits (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT), whereas moving UP to (8,9) would limit us to only two exits on the top edge. The enemy is far away and cannot interfere this turn. This move also avoids immediate danger.\n\nPlan: After eating, head to (8,7). Next turn, move LEFT to (7,7) or DOWN to (8,6) to head toward the cluster of apples in the southwest (e.g., (7,3), (6,3), (5,2), (4,6)). Avoid edges to stay flexible and watch enemy movements to prevent being cut off.\n\nDOWN",

Suicide -> Enemy dies.\n- DOWN to (1,5): Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT to (0,6): Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (2,6): Empty. Safe.\n\nThe enemy is unlikely to move UP into itself. They will likely move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**My Potential Moves:**\n1.  **UP to (8,7):** My head is currently at (8,6). (8,7) is my current body segment. Moving UP would be moving into my own body (backwards). **Result: I die.**\n2.  **DOWN to (8,5):**\n    - Coordinates (8,5) are empty.\n    - Does this hit my body? No.\n    - Does this hit enemy body? No.\n    - **Result: Survive.**\n    - *Turn 6 implications:* My body moves to (8,6), (8,7). My head is at (8,5). Safe directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP goes back to (8,6) which is now safe but leads to a loop). Being at (8,5) gives good access to apples at (7,3), (6,3), etc.\n3.  **LEFT to (7,6):**\n    - Coordinates (7,6) are empty.\n    - Does this hit my body? No.\n    - Does this hit enemy body? No.\n    - **Result: Survive.**\n    - *Turn 6 implications:* My body moves to (8,6), (8,7). My head is at (7,6). Safe directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT. (RIGHT goes back to (8,6) which is safe). (7,6) is near an apple at (7,3).\n4.  **RIGHT to (9,6):**\n    - Coordinates (9,6) are empty.\n    - Does this hit my body? No.\n    - Does this hit enemy body? No.\n    - **Result: Survive.**\n    - *Turn 6 implications:* My body moves to (8,6), (8,7). My head is at (9,6). Safe directions: LEFT, DOWN. (UP to (9,7) is empty but risks hitting the top edge eventually; RIGHT would be off-board). This move limits future mobility near the right edge.\n\n**Comparing Moves:**\n- **UP** is fatal.\n- **RIGHT** restricts future movement significantly (only 2 safe moves next turn: LEFT and DOWN).\n- **DOWN** and **LEFT** are safer with more future options.\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\nWe are trailing by 1 apple (2 vs 3). We need to eat apples.\nThe apple at (7,3) is a good target. It is reachable from (8,5) or (7,6).\nThe apple at (6,3) is also a good target.\nThe cluster in the southwest (4,6), (5,2) is viable.\n\n**Decision:**\nChoosing **DOWN** to (8,5).\nWhy?\n- (8,5) is safe and keeps us away from the central column where the enemy is.\n- From (8,5), we can move LEFT towards (7,3) or DOWN towards (5,2).\n- It avoids the immediate danger of the enemy potentially moving RIGHT to (2,6) or UP to (1,7) (though suicide, unlikely).\n- (8,5) offers excellent maneuverability: Left to (7,5), Down to (8,4), Right to (9,5). It is not near a wall.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n- Off-board? No.\n- Own Body? No (Body is (8,7), (8,8)).\n- Enemy Body? No (Enemy is at x=1).\n\n**Move Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (8,5).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nHead towards the apple at (7,3). The enemy is on the left side; staying on the right or moving center-left allows us to gather apples without immediate collision risk. Monitor enemy movement to ensure they don't cut us off.\n\n**Final Check:**\nIs there any trap at (8,5)? No.\nIs there any trap at (7,6)? (7,6) is also good, but (8,5) feels slightly more central to the available apples on the bottom half of the board (7,3, 6,3, 5,2). (8,5) is also \"cleaner\" in terms of not being directly adjacent to the enemy's likely path immediately.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nApples at: (7, 1), (0, 0), (9, 4), (4, 8), (3, 0), (6, 3), (2, 3), (5, 2), (8, 9), (7, 3), (1, 4), (4, 6), (0, 3), (2, 0), (6, 9).\nFrom (8,5), I am 2 moves away from (7,3), 3 moves from (6,3), 3 moves from (5,2).\nFrom (7,6), I am 3 moves away from (7,3), 3 from (6,3), 4 from (5,2).\n(8,5) is slightly closer to the (7,3) and (5,2) apples.\n\nLet's re-evaluate (7,6) vs (8,5).\n(7,6) puts me at x=7. (8,5) puts me at x=8, y=5.\n(8,5) is a very safe spot. I will proceed with DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Suicide.\n- DOWN to (1, 4): Empty.\n- LEFT to (0, 5): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (2, 5): Empty.\n\n**My Potential Moves from (8, 5):**\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):**\n    - (8, 6) is currently my body segment (the one directly behind my head).\n    - Moving UP would move into my own body.\n    - **Result: IMMEDIATE DEATH.**\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 4):**\n    - Empty.\n    - Adjacent to Apple (9, 4).\n    - **Result: SURVIVE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):**\n    - Empty.\n    - Moves towards apples (7, 3), (6, 3).\n    - **Result: SURVIVE.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n    - Empty.\n    - **Result: SURVIVE.**\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT vs RIGHT):**\n- **RIGHT (9, 5):** Moves to the very edge of the board. From (9, 5), I can only go UP, DOWN, or LEFT (RIGHT is out of bounds). This limits my immediate options. However, it is adjacent to an apple at (9, 4).\n- **LEFT (7, 5):** Moves inward. From (7, 5), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (back to 8,5). This offers maximum mobility.\n- **DOWN (8, 4):** Moves inward. From (8, 4), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. This is adjacent to apple (9, 4).\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\n1.  **Survival:** Avoid walls and traps.\n2.  **Efficiency:** Move towards apples.\n3.  **Mobility:** Keep options open.\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nThe move UP is fatal.\nThe move RIGHT puts me against the wall. While (9, 4) is an apple, going to the wall reduces maneuverability against an opponent who might flank.\nThe move LEFT (7, 5) is good for mobility.\nThe move DOWN (8, 4) is also good for mobility and sets me up perfectly for the apple at (9, 4). From (8, 4), I can pivot LEFT to (7, 4) or UP to (8, 5).\n\nLet's look at the apple at (9, 4). It is currently empty. If I move DOWN to (8, 4), on Turn 7 I can move RIGHT to (9, 4) to eat the apple.\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 5), I am not immediately positioned for a specific apple, though I am closer to the cluster in the bottom left.\n\nHowever, looking at the board state, the bottom-left quadrant has many apples but also many existing empty spaces. The immediate danger is less about apples and more about maintaining space.\n(8, 4) is safe.\n(7, 5) is safe.\n\nLet's consider the specific value of (8, 4).\nCurrent Head: (8, 5).\nMove DOWN to (8, 4).\nNew Head: (8, 4).\nNew Body: [(8, 5), (8, 6)].\nFrom (8, 4), I can go:\n- Up: Back to (8, 5) (Safe)\n- Down: To (8, 3) (Safe)\n- Left: To (7, 4) (Safe)\n- Right: To (9, 4) (Apple!)\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 5):\nNew Head: (7, 5).\nNew Body: [(8, 5), (8, 6)].\nFrom (7, 5), I can go:\n- Left: (6, 5) (Safe)\n- Right: (8, 5) (Safe)\n- Down: (7, 4) (Safe)\n- Up: (7, 6) (Safe)\n\nComparing the future options, (8, 4) offers a clear path to the apple at (9, 4) without sacrificing safety or mobility. (7, 5) is slightly more central but doesn't have an immediate apple in the next step (the apple at (7, 3) is 2 steps away, requiring a turn at (7, 4)).\nAlso, moving DOWN to (8, 4) shifts my position away from the center where the enemy might eventually migrate, and towards the corner which I can claim.\n\nWait, looking at the board map provided:\nRow 5 (y=5): `. 1 . . . . . . . 0 .` (Enemy at 1,5, Me at 8,5).\nRow 4 (y=4): `. A . . . . . . . . A` (Apple at 1,4 and 9,4).\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 4), I am at x=8, y=4.\nIf I move RIGHT next turn to (9, 4), I eat an apple and grow.\nThis seems like a solid, safe plan.\n\nIs there any reason not to go DOWN?\n- Collision with enemy? Enemy is at x=1. No.\n- Wall? No.\n- Self? No.\n\nIs there any reason not to go LEFT?\n- No, but DOWN seems slightly better because it positions me to eat an apple immediately next turn (Turn 7) by moving RIGHT to (9, 4).\n\nLet's double check the map.\n`9 . . . . . . A . A .`\n`8 . . . . A . . . . .`\n`7 T T . . . . . . T .`\n`6 . T . . A . . . T .`\n`5 . 1 . . . . . . 0 .`\n`4 . A . . . . . . . . A`\n`3 A . A . . . A A . .`\n`2 . . . . . A . . . .`\n`1 . . . . . . . A . .`\n`0 A . A A . . . . . .`\n\nApple at (9, 4) is confirmed in the grid (Row 4 ends with `. A` at indices 8, 9).\nApple at (7, 3) is confirmed (Row 3 has `A . A . . . A A . .` indices 0-9: (0,3) A, (1,3) ., (2,3) A, (3,3) ., (4,3) ., (5,3) ., (6,3) A, (7,3) A, (8,3) ., (9,3) .). Yes, (7,3) is there.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 4), I am closer to (7, 3) AND (9, 4).\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 5), I am closer to (7, 3) but further from (9, 4).\n\nThe plan:\nTurn 6: Move DOWN to (8, 4).\nTurn 7: Move RIGHT to (9, 4) to eat the apple.\n\nThis grows my length and scores a point, putting me closer to the enemy's score.\nThe enemy is far away (x=1) and likely moving LEFT or DOWN (avoiding its own body at (1,6)). They pose no immediate threat to my position at (8,4).\n\n**Final Check:**\nMove DOWN to (8, 4).\nIs (8, 4) empty? Yes (Row 4: `. A . . . . . . . . A`, index 8 is `.`).\nWill I hit myself? No, my body moves with me.\nWill I hit enemy? No.\n\nMove is safe. Move is productive.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

You moved `DOWN` in the previous turn (Turn 6) from `(8, 5)` to `(8, 4)`. Score: 2.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head at `(1, 4)`, Body at `[(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7)]`. Score: 4.\n- **Apples:** `(9, 4)` is adjacent to your head to the right.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP to (8, 5):** This is the cell directly behind your head. Since your body moves forward, this cell will be occupied by your own body segment. Moving here results in immediate death.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 4):** Contains an apple. Empty. Safe. Eating the apple will increase your score to 3 and grow your length to 4.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n- The goal is to maximize score while maintaining safety.\n- The apple at `(9, 4)` is immediately reachable and safe to take.\n- Taking this apple puts you at 3 apples, closing the gap with the enemy (who has 4 apples).\n- Moving `RIGHT` to `(9, 4)` is the most productive move. It prevents the enemy from potentially intercepting the apple in the future and secures immediate points.\n- From `(9, 4)`, your next options will be `UP` to `(9, 5)`, `DOWN` to `(9, 3)`, or `LEFT` back to `(8, 4)`. While `(9, 4)` is on the wall, it is not a trap as you have 3 valid directions to move from there.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMove `RIGHT` to eat the apple at `(9, 4)`.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: `[(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7)]`.\n- **Apples:** The board state shows apples at `(9, 4)` and `(8, 9)` among others. However, I moved into `(9, 4)` on the previous turn (Turn 7). I ate that apple, and my body grew. My current head is `(9, 4)`. The apple at `(9, 4)` should be gone.\n\n**2. Move Safety Evaluation (simultaneous movement consideration):**\n- **UP to (9, 5):**\n  - My body: `(8, 5)` is currently adjacent, but on the next turn, my body shifts. `(9, 5)` is currently empty.\n  - Enemy: Head at `(1, 3)`. It moves to `(1, 2)` (Down), `(1, 4)` (Up), `(2, 3)` (Right), or `(0, 3)` (Left). It cannot reach `(9, 5)`.\n  - Safety: Safe.\n- **DOWN to (9, 3):**\n  - My body: `(8, 3)` is empty. `(8, 4)` will move to `(8, 3)` in the next turn, but I am moving to `(9, 3)`.\n  - Enemy: Safe.\n  - Safety: Safe.\n- **LEFT to (8, 4):**\n  - My body: `(8, 4)` is currently my body segment (the neck). Moving directly backwards into your own body is death.\n  - Safety: **DEATH**.\n- **RIGHT:** Off the board (x=10). **DEATH**.\n\n**3. Strategic Analysis (UP vs DOWN):**\n- **Direction UP (9, 5):** Places me in the top-right corner. From there, I can move Left `(8, 5)`, Up `(9, 6)`, or Down `(9, 4)` (occupied by my tail). This creates a potential corner trap if I am not careful. However, the top-right region has apples at `(6, 9)` and `(8, 9)`.\n- **Direction DOWN (9, 3):** Moves me away from the corner. From `(9, 3)`, I can move Left `(8, 3)`, Up `(9, 4)`, or Down `(9, 2)`. This keeps more options open and moves toward the center of the board. The apple at `(6, 4)` is reachable from this path.\n\n**4. Enemy Monitoring:**\n- Enemy is at `(1, 3)` with 4 apples. They are far away in the bottom-left. They are not an immediate collision threat.\n\n**5. Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** is safer because it keeps me off the wall and maintains flexibility. Moving **UP** risks getting stuck in the corner or forcing a sharp turn later. Although there is an apple at `(8, 9)`, the path via `(9, 3)` allows me to pivot to the central apples `(6, 4)` or `(5, 2)` efficiently without risking entrapment immediately.\n\n**Plan:** Move DOWN to `(9, 3)`. This avoids the corner trap and opens up the route to the central apple at `(6, 4)`.\n\nDOWN",

This places the head back near the top-right corner. The body follows to (9, 3). From (9, 4), the only immediate exits are Left (8, 4) or Down (9, 3).

Moving Down returns me to (9, 3).\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** (8, 9) and (6, 9) are far, requiring a difficult U-turn through the top edge.\n    *   **Verdict:** High risk of getting stuck in the corner or forcing a risky maneuver later.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (9, 2)**\n    *   **Risk:** Low.

(8, 3) is empty. The body follows to (9, 3). From (8, 3), I can move Left (7, 3), Down (8, 2), or Up (8, 4).\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** (7, 3) contains an apple.

From there, I can continue Left to (6, 3) (which has an apple) or move towards the center (6, 4) or (5, 2).\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:** The enemy is at (0, 3).

This returns me to a previous body coordinate (though it will be empty). It positions me in a tight corridor (8, 4) flanked by my body on the right (9, 4) and above (8, 5). From (8, 4), my only forward moves are UP (8, 5), LEFT (7, 4), or DOWN (8, 3). This is not immediately fatal but restricts mobility. It moves me away from the nearby apples at (7, 3) and (6, 3).\n    *   **Verdict:** Suboptimal, reduces mobility.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (8, 2)**\n    *   **Risk:** Low. (8, 2) is empty. From (8, 2), I can move DOWN (8, 1), LEFT (7, 2), or UP (8, 3).

The enemy's body extends to (0, 3), (1, 3), etc. If the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (1, 2), it is safe. However, if the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (1, 3) (which is currently occupied by its own body but will shift), it creates a collision zone. More critically, the enemy could move **RIGHT** to (1, 3) if its tail shifts.\n    *   **The Fatal Flaw:** If I move to (7, 3), I am moving into the apple. However, looking at the board, there is a \"T\" at (6, 3) in the board state provided (Row 3: `T T A . . . A A 0 T`). Wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\n        `3 T T A . . .

My body is (9,3), (9,4), (8,4).\n        If I move LEFT to (7, 3), I eat the apple.\n        *However*, I must check if (7, 3) is safe from the enemy.\n        The enemy is at (0, 2). Their body is at (0, 3), (1, 3)...\n        If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 2), they are safe.\n        If the enemy moves UP to (0, 3), that is currently their own body. Wait, the enemy body list is `[(0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]`.\n        If the enemy moves UP to (0, 3), that is the cell immediately behind their head (0, 2). Since their head is (0, 2), moving UP to (0, 3) is moving into their own body (the segment at (0, 3)). This is illegal for them (suicide). They will not do that.\n        So the enemy will likely move RIGHT to (1, 2) or DOWN to (0, 1) or UP to (0, 3) (suicide).\n        If they move RIGHT to (1, 2), they are safe.\n        *But wait*, looking at the board state `Row 2: 1 . . . . . A . . . .`\n        The enemy head (0, 2) is represented by '1'.\n        If I move to (7, 3), I eat the apple. Is (7, 3) safe from the enemy? The enemy is far away (x=0 vs x=7).\n        **Wait, I missed a critical detail in the Board State provided in the prompt.**\n        Let's re-read the board state carefully.\n        `3 T T A . . . A A 0 T`\n        (0,3)=T, (1,3)=T, (2,3)=A, (6,3)=A, (7,3)=A, (8,3)=0, (9,3)=T.\n        My body is at (9,3), (9,4), (8,4).\n        If I move LEFT to (7, 3), I eat the apple.\n        Is (7, 3) occupied? No.\n        Is it off-board? No.\n        Is it my own body? No.\n        Is it enemy body? No.\n        **So why did I think it was risky?**\n        I need to re-evaluate the \"Strategic Evaluation\" I wrote in my head versus the reality of the board.\n        The board state shows a \"T\" at (9, 3). My body is listed as (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4).\n        If I move LEFT, my tail shifts. (9, 3) becomes empty.\n        The board state shows \"T\" at (9, 4)? No, Row 4 is `4 . T . . . . A . T T`\n        (0,4)=., (1,4)=T, (2,4)=., (3,4)=., (4,4)=., (5,4)=., (6,4)=A, (7,4)=., (8,4)=T, (9,4)=T.\n        My body is (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4).\n        If I move LEFT to (7, 3):\n        New Head: (7, 3).\n        New Body: [(8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4)].\n        Wait, my current body is [(9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4)].\n        If I move LEFT, the new tail is (8, 4).\n        So new body: (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4).\n        Let's check the board state again.\n        Row 3: `3 T T A . . . A A 0 T`\n        (0,3)=T, (1,3)=T, (2,3)=A, (6,3)=A, (7,3)=A, (8,3)=0, (9,3)=T.\n        Row 4: `4 . T . . . . A . T T`\n        (0,4)=., (1,4)=T, (2,4)=., (3,4)=., (4,4)=., (5,4)=., (6,4)=A, (7,4)=., (8,4)=T, (9,4)=T.\n        My current head: (8, 3).\n        My current body: (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4).\n        Enemy Head: (0, 2).\n        Enemy Body: (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6).\n\n        **Check LEFT to (7, 3):**\n        (7, 3) is an apple (A).\n        Is it safe?\n        My current body: (9,3), (9,4), (8,4). (7,3) is not in my body.\n        Enemy body: (0,3), (1,3)... (7,3) is not in enemy body.\n        Is it off-board? No.\n        Is it backwards? (8,3) -> (7,3). My previous head was (8,3). The cell behind my head (9,3) is currently occupied by my body, but will shift. Moving backwards is into the cell (9,3). (7,3) is not backwards.\n        **So (7, 3) is SAFE.**\n\n        **Check DOWN to (8, 2):**\n        (8, 2) is empty (Row 2: `1 . . . . . A . . . .` -> (8,2) is '.').\n        Is it safe?\n        Not my body. Not enemy body. Not off-board.\n        **So (8, 2) is SAFE.**\n\n        **Why did I initially reject LEFT in my internal monologue?**\n        I must have been looking at a potential collision or trap that doesn't exist in the immediate step, or I misread the board.\n        Let's look at Row 3 again: `3 T T A . . . A A 0 T`\n        (6,3)=A, (7,3)=A.\n        If I move to (7, 3), I eat an apple.\n        If I move to (8, 2), I don't.\n\n        **Strategic Re-evaluation:**\n        Eating the apple at (7, 3) is the best immediate gain. It grows my snake, giving me more length and points.\n        Is there any danger in eating it?\n        If I eat (7, 3), my new head is (7, 3).\n        My new body is (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4).\n        The enemy is at (0, 2). They are nowhere near me.\n        The only risk is if the enemy moves in a way that traps me *next* turn, or if I trap myself.\n        From (7, 3), where can I go next?\n        - UP (7, 4): Empty (Row 4: `... . T T` at 8,4 and 9,4).\n        - DOWN (7, 2): Empty.\n        - LEFT (6, 3): Apple.\n        - RIGHT (8, 3): My new body (safe).\n        So from (7, 3), I have 3 forward moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n        From (8, 2), I have moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT(9,2)).\n        \n        **Comparing (7, 3) vs (8, 2):**\n        (7, 3) gives +1 apple.\n        (8, 2) gives +0 apples.\n        \n        **Long term plan:**\n        Eat the apple at (7, 3). Then head towards the cluster at (6, 3) and (6, 4).\n        The enemy is slow and on the left side. I have time.\n        \n        **Wait, re-reading the board state carefully:**\n        `3 T T A . . . A A 0 T`\n        Is that \"T\" at (9, 3) part of my body? Yes.\n        Is the \"A\" at (7, 3) accessible? Yes.\n        \n        **Why did I think LEFT was risky earlier?**\n        Perhaps I confused it with the previous turn's logic where I was at (9,3) and (9,4) was a trap.\n        Currently at (8,3), moving LEFT to (7,3) is opening up the board to the left.\n        \n        **Let's double check the \"BACKWARDS\" rule.**\n        My head is at (8,3).\n        The cell behind my head is (9,3).\n        If I move LEFT to (7,3), I am not moving into (9,3).\n        So it's not backwards suicide.\n        \n        **Decision:**\n        Move LEFT to (7, 3) to eat the apple. This is the highest reward safe move.\n        \n        **Wait, I should check if (6, 3) is an apple.**\n        Board row 3: `... . . . A A 0 T`\n        (6,3) is A.\n        (7,3) is A.\n        If I eat (7,3), I can go to (6,3) next.\n        \n        **Enemy Analysis:**\n        Enemy is at (0,2). They are not a threat.\n        \n        **Final Check on (7, 3):**\n        Is (7, 3) occupied by *anything* right now?\n        Board: `7 A . . . . . . . . .`\n        (0,7)=A.\n        Row 3: `3 T T A . . . A A 0 T`\n        (7,3)=A.\n        It is an apple. It is empty of snakes.\n        \n        **Conclusion:**\n        Move LEFT.\n        \n        **Correction:**\n        I initially wrote \"DOWN\" in my draft rationale due to a misinterpretation of the risk of eating the apple, or perhaps a confusion with the \"T\" notation. However, looking strictly at the board state, (7, 3) is an apple and is empty. It is a safe, high-value move.\n        \n        **Wait, I need to be absolutely sure about the \"T\" at (9,3).**\n        My body is `[(9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4)]`.\n        The board shows `T` at (9,3) and (9,4) and (8,4).\n        If I move LEFT, my tail (8,4) leaves.\n        New body: `(8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4)`.\n        The board shows `0` at (8,3) (current head) and `T` at (9,3) and `T` at (9,4).\n        The board state provided is the *current* state.\n        The move to (7,3) is valid.\n        \n        **Why did I hesitate?**\n        Maybe I thought (7,3) was blocked or risky for future turns?\n        From (7,3), I can go to (6,3) (Apple), (7,4) (Empty), (7,2) (Empty).\n        That's 3 options.\n        From (8,2), I have 4 options.\n        The difference is 1 option vs +1 apple.\n        In Snake, +1 apple is usually worth the slight reduction in future options, especially when the options remaining are still good.\n        \n        **Actually, looking at the board again:**\n        Row 4: `4 . T . . . . A . T T`\n        (6,4) is A.\n        If I go (7,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,4), I get 2 apples.\n        \n        **Let's stick with LEFT.**\n        \n        **Wait, I see \"T\" at (1,4) and (1,3) in the board state.**\n        These match the enemy body.\n        Enemy head (0,2).\n        Enemy body (0,3), (1,3), (1,4)...\n        The enemy is definitely on the left.\n        \n        **Final confirmation:**\n        Move LEFT to (7, 3).\n        It is an apple.\n        It is safe.\n        It progresses the game.\n        \n        **Self-Correction:**\n        I initially drafted \"DOWN\" because I was worried about getting trapped or hitting a \"T\" that I thought might be an obstacle or a body part that doesn't shift correctly.\n        But the \"T\"s on the board are just representations of the current snake bodies.\n        My body is (9,3), (9,4), (8,4).\n        Enemy body is (0,3), (1,3), (1,4)...\n        (7,3) is clear.\n        \n        **One last check:**\n        Is there any apple at (8,2)?\n        Row 2: `1 . . . . . A . . . .`\n        (6,2)=A.\n        (8,2)=.\n        (7,3)=A.\n        (6,3)=A.\n        \n        Moving LEFT is the correct aggressive move.\n        \n        **Wait, looking at the coordinates:**\n        (8,3) -> (7,3).\n        If I move LEFT, I am moving towards the enemy's side of the board (Left).\n        The enemy is at (0,2).\n        This is fine. I am moving into the open board.\n        \n        **Decision:** LEFT.\n        \n        **Strategy for next turn:**\n        Eat apple at (7,3). Then move to (6,3) or (6,4).\n        \n        **Re-reading my previous rationale:**\n        I previously thought (7,3) was risky. Why?\n        \"Option 3: LEFT to (7, 3) ... Risk: High.\"\n        I must have hallucinated a threat there. There is no threat. (7,3) is an apple.\n        \n        **Why did I draft DOWN?**\n        I wrote: \"Moving DOWN is the best option. It keeps me safe...\". This was a mistake in my reasoning process. (7,3) is safe and better.\n        \n        **Correcting to LEFT.**\n        \n        **One final check on the board state:**\n        `3 T T A . . . A A 0 T`\n        Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        (0,3)=T, (1,3)=T, (2,3)=A, (6,3)=A, (7,3)=A, (8,3)=0, (9,3)=T.\n        My head (8,3). My body (9,3)...\n        Moving to (7,3).\n        Is (7,3) blocked by the enemy? No.\n        Is (7,3) blocked by me? No.\n        Is (7,3) off board? No.\n        \n        It is a valid move.\n        \n        **Plan:**\n        1. Move LEFT to (7, 3) to eat the apple.\n        2. Next turn, likely move LEFT to (6, 3) to eat that apple, or UP/DOWN to clear space.\n        \n        **Final check:**\n        The board has many apples. It is safe to eat this one.\n        \n        **Wait, is there an apple at (7,3)?**\n        Yes, the prompt says: \"Apples at: (7, 1), (0, 0), (4, 8), (3, 0), (6, 3), (2, 3), (5, 2), (8, 9), (7, 3), (4, 6), (2, 0), (6, 9), (6, 4), (0, 7), (9, 6)\"\n        Yes, (7, 3) is in the list.\n        \n        **Decision:** LEFT.\n        \n        **Wait, the board state shows `A` at (7,3).**\n        This confirms it.\n        \n        **Why did I hesitate?**\n        I was worried about the \"T\" at (9,3) being a collision if I moved into it, but I am moving to (7,3), not (9,3).\n        \n        **Okay, LEFT is the move.**\n        \n        **Wait, the board state has `0` at (8,3).**\n        That's me.\n        Moving LEFT puts me at (7,3).\n        \n        **Okay, proceeding with LEFT.**\n        \n        **Wait, looking at the board state again:**\n        Row 3: `3 T T A . . .

Wait, looking at the board state: `(0, 1)` is marked as `1` (Enemy) in the board state provided in the prompt. This confirms the enemy moved DOWN and ate the apple at (0, 1).\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (7, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (7, 4):**\n    *   **Is it safe?** (7, 4) is empty in the current board state.

Wait, is (8, 4) occupied?\n            *   My current body is (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4).\n            *   If I move UP, my body shifts: (8, 3) moves to (7, 3), (9, 3) moves to (8, 3), (9, 4) moves to (9, 3).\n            *   Wait, I need to be precise about the shift.\n            *   Current: Head (7, 3).

The cell behind is (8, 3).\n    *   **Rule:** \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n    *   **Result:** **DEATH.**\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   **UP:** Safe, maintains mobility.\n*   **DOWN:** Safe, gives access to apple at (7, 1) next turn.\n*   **LEFT:** Safe, eats apple at (6, 3) immediately. Provides access to another apple at (6, 4) next turn.\n*   **RIGHT:** Death.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am currently tied with the enemy in apples (5-5). The enemy is far away (x=0). Eating an apple now extends my lead. (6, 3) is a safe apple that I can take immediately without cornering myself. From (6, 3), I have 4 safe exits.\n\n**Plan:**\nEat the apple at (6, 3).

My head is at (6, 4).\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (1, 0), Body [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4)]\n    *   *Status:* He is \"scrambling\" near the bottom left corner. He has an apple at (3, 0) and (2, 0). He likely cannot reach the center apples effectively.\n*   **Apples Eaten:** 6-6 Tie.\n*   **Turn Limit:** 13/150 (Very early game).\n\n**Evaluate Moves from (6, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (6, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 5) is empty ('.'). No immediate collision.\n    *   **Future Outlook:** From (6, 5), I can reach (6, 9) (Apple) and (8, 9) (Apple). However, this move takes me up into the vertical strip near x=6. My body currently occupies a horizontal line from x=6 to x=9 at y=3, and a vertical line at x=9. Moving UP is safe but leaves me with a body below that might hinder movement if I need to retreat. However, the tail moves, so space opens up.\n    *   **Risk:** Enemy is at (1, 0). They are far away. No risk of head-on collision here.\n\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 3) is currently my body (specifically the segment immediately behind my head).\n    *   **Rule:** Moving directly backwards into your own body is death.\n    *   **Outcome:** **DEATH.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** (5, 4) is empty ('.'). No immediate collision.\n    *   **Future Outlook:** From (5, 4), I can go DOWN to (5, 3) (Safe), LEFT to (4, 4) (Safe), or UP to (5, 5) (Safe). This opens up the center of the board. There is an apple at (5, 2). Moving LEFT gets me closer to the central apple cluster ((5, 2), (4, 6), (2, 3), (2, 2)).\n    *   **Comparison to UP:** UP moves me towards the top wall (y=9). LEFT moves me towards the center/left area where more apples are clustered. I am currently on the right side (x=6). The apple at (5, 2) is very close.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 4) is empty ('.'). However, I must check the turn 14 implications.\n    *   **Future Outlook:** If I move RIGHT to (7, 4), my body will follow. My head was at (6, 4). My tail was at (8, 4).\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 4), my body becomes: [(6, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4)].\n    *   The tail (8, 4) moves to (9, 4) (which is already occupied by my body? No, wait, the tail is (8, 4). The body is [(6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4)].\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 4), the new body is [(6, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4)].\n    *   **The Trap:** On Turn 14, if I am at (7, 4), the space (6, 4) will be occupied by my body (the neck). (8, 4) will be occupied by my body (the segment from (9, 4) shifting). (7, 3) is my body. The only open moves from (7, 4) might be limited. Specifically, if I move RIGHT again to (8, 4), (8, 4) will be occupied by my body (coming from (9, 4)). If I move UP to (7, 5), that's open. If I move DOWN to (7, 3), that's my body. If I move LEFT to (6, 4), that's my body. So (7, 4) leaves me with only UP as a safe move immediately next turn (assuming standard movement). This is a \"forced move\" scenario which is risky.\n    *   **Apple:** No apple at (7, 4).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\n*   **Avoid RIGHT (7, 4):** This move creates a \"box\" shape with my body (Head (7,4), Neck (6,4), Body (6,3, 7,3, 8,3, 9,3), and Tail (9,4)). From (7, 4), the only exit is UP (7, 5). Moving into a position with only one exit is dangerous. While the enemy is far, limiting my own mobility is poor strategy.\n*   **Avoid DOWN (6, 3):** Immediate death.\n*   **Compare UP (6, 5) vs LEFT (5, 4):**\n    *   **UP (6, 5):** Moves towards the top-right corner. There are apples at (8, 9) and (6, 9). However, I am currently length 7. Getting pinned in the corner is a risk if the enemy enters the center or if I run out of space. Also, the apple at (8, 9) is far (distance 4).\n    *   **LEFT (5, 4):** Moves toward the center. There is an apple at (5, 2) (distance 2) and (4, 6) (distance 2). The center is generally safer and offers more branching paths. My body is currently blocking the way to the immediate left (x=5, y=3 is blocked by body at (6,3) and (7,3)? No, (5,3) is empty).\n    *   From (5, 4), I can safely move to (5, 3) (which will be open as my tail moves from (8, 4) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3)? No, tail is at (8, 4). Wait, let's trace the body.\n    *   Current Body: [(6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4)].\n    *   If I move LEFT to (5, 4):\n        *   Head: (5, 4)\n        *   Body: [(6, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4)]\n        *   Tail: (8, 4) is removed (becomes (9, 4)).\n    *   This is a very clean move. It shifts my body slightly rightward (increasing X) while my head moves leftward. This effectively \"retracts\" the tail into the column x=9, freeing up space at (8, 4).\n    *   From (5, 4), I have 4 safe exits: UP (5, 5), DOWN (5, 3), LEFT (4, 4), RIGHT (6, 4). This is maximal mobility.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLEFT (5, 4) is the superior move. It avoids the potential trap of moving RIGHT, avoids death by moving DOWN, and offers better board control and future flexibility than moving UP towards the wall.

Good connectivity.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 4):** **Unsafe (Self-collision).** My body occupies (6, 4).\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need to choose a move that maximizes safety and opens paths to apples. The enemy is not an immediate threat. Moving to the edge (Right) is generally bad. Moving UP or DOWN moves me towards the walls. Moving LEFT moves me toward the center of the board (x=4), which offers the most future flexibility.\n\nFrom (5, 4), moving LEFT to (4, 4) places my head in a central location. My tail is currently at (9, 4). Moving left shifts my body and eventually allows the tail to move down into (9, 3), opening up the column for potential future movement if I return to the right side.\n\nComparing the targets:\n1.  Target (5, 2): Requires DOWN, DOWN. From (5, 4), going DOWN first moves my head to (5, 3). While safe, (5, 3) is horizontally aligned with my body at (6, 3). This creates a horizontal line of my body segments at y=3, limiting immediate Left/Right movement from (5, 3) in the next turn (Right is blocked by body at (6, 3), Left is open).\n2.  Target (4, 6): Requires UP, LEFT (or LEFT, UP). Moving UP to (5, 5) or LEFT to (4, 4) are both viable first steps. (4, 4) is particularly strong as it is not vertically aligned with my current body, offering maximum movement options (Up, Down, Left) in the subsequent turn.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 4) is the optimal choice for maintaining high mobility and positioning for either the apple at (4, 6) or (5, 2) depending on how the board evolves.\n\nLEFT",

It moves away from the static obstacles at y=3 and the enemy snake's potential future expansion at y=1-3.\n    *   **Body Management:** My tail is currently at (9, 3). Moving UP shifts the body, eventually allowing the tail to move left from (9, 3) to (8, 3) or (9, 2) depending on subsequent moves. This is fine.\n\n    **Decision:** Moving UP is the optimal choice.

I need to close the gap. I am sitting directly under an apple at (4, 8). Taking it is the immediate reward. The path is safe and grows my snake.

LEFT is safe because the cell is currently your tail and will vacate as you move.\n\n- Strategic reasoning:\n  - LEFT takes you to the left edge where two apples are available at (0,7) and (0,8). Reaching them requires a few vertical moves, but the path along x=0 is clear and you won\u2019t immediately collide with your own body.\n  - UP or DOWN would keep you in the central area with fewer immediate apple opportunities and slightly more exposure to potential head-ons with the enemy on the right.\n  - The enemy snake is currently at (4,7) and would need several turns to reach the left-side apples. By committing to the left edge, you reduce the chance of an early head-on collision and maintain a clear route to growing apples.\n\n- Long-term plan note (for self): Move LEFT this turn to start a controlled ascent along the left edge. Then proceed UP to reach apples at (0,7) and (0,8). After securing those, reassess relative enemy position and either push further left or shift upward to chase vertically distributed apples, while avoiding direct head-on trades.\n\nLEFT",

The tail cell (0, 2) is adjacent to the head (0, 3). This means if the enemy moves DOWN to (0, 2), it will be moving into its own tail, which will move away, resulting in no collision. If the enemy moves UP or LEFT, it risks collision or death. The enemy is likely to move DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**Available Apples (Confirmed from list and board):**\n*   **Priority 1 (Adjacent):**\n    *   (5, 8) - Right\n    *   (3, 8) - Left\n    *   (4, 9) - Up\n*   **Priority 2 (Reachable):**\n    *   (3, 9) - Diagonal left-up\n    *   (4, 3) - Straight down (below my body)\n    *   (5, 2) - Further down/right\n    *   (6, 1) - Further down/right\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **UP -> (4, 9):**\n    *   **Collision:** (4, 9) is empty.\n    *   **Apple:** Yes! (4, 9) is an apple.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Grows my snake.\n    *   **Future:** From (4, 9), I can move to (3, 9), (5, 9), or (4, 8) (current head, safe if tail moves). (5, 9) is a wall. (3, 9) is an apple. (4, 8) is my body, but that will move. This is a good position.\n\n2.  **RIGHT -> (5, 8):**\n    *   **Collision:** (5, 8) is empty.\n    *   **Apple:** Yes! (5, 8) is an apple.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Grows my snake.\n    *   **Future:** From (5, 8), I can move to (5, 9) [Wall], (6, 8) [Empty], (4, 8) [Body], (5, 7) [Empty]. While (5, 9) is a wall, (6, 8) and (5, 7) are valid moves. However, (6, 8) is near the right wall which might limit future maneuvering.\n\n3.  **LEFT -> (3, 8):**\n    *   **Collision:** (3, 8) is empty.\n    *   **Apple:** Yes! (3, 8) is an apple (Row 8: `A . . . A . . . . .` -> (3,8) is '.').\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Grows my snake.\n    *   **Future:** From (3, 8), I can move to (3, 9) [Apple], (2, 8) [Empty], (3, 7) [Empty], (4, 8) [Body]. This path seems very open and leads to another apple at (3, 9). (2, 8) and (3, 7) provide good lateral movement options.\n\n4.  **DOWN -> (4, 7):**\n    *   **Collision:** (4, 7) is my current neck. Moving DOWN is moving backwards into myself. **Invalid.**\n\n**Strategic Comparison (Up vs Left vs Right):**\n*   **Right (5, 8):** Leads towards the right wall (x=9). While it gives an apple, the map narrows there. (6, 8) is open, but (5, 9) is a wall.\n*   **Up (4, 9):** Leads to the top wall (y=9). (5, 9) is a wall. (3, 9) is an apple, but I would have to turn left from there. The top-left corner (0,9) is occupied by an enemy tail (from the board `A . . . A . . . . .` at row 9 shows (3,9) and (0,9) are apples, (2,9) is an apple, but (1,9) is empty). Actually looking at the board: Row 9 is `9 . . A A . . A . A .`. (3,9) and (4,9) are apples. (0,9) is empty space? No, (0,9) is '.' on the board. (1,9) is '.'.\n*   **Left (3, 8):** This moves me towards the center-left area. From (3, 8), I can go to (3, 9) (Apple) or (2, 8) or (3, 7). This keeps me flexible. The left side of the board (x=0-2) is dominated by the enemy, but the center-left (x=3-6) is relatively open for me.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will choose **LEFT** to (3, 8).\nReasoning:\n1.  It secures an apple at (3, 8).\n2.  It opens up a path to (3, 9) (another apple) or (2, 8) (open space).\n3.  It keeps me slightly more central than moving Right (towards wall) or Up (towards wall), maintaining escape routes.\n4.  The enemy is at (0, 3), which is far enough away that I don't need to worry about immediate collision on this turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat (3, 8) -> (3, 9). Then move down towards the cluster of apples at (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 6). Keep the enemy snake in the bottom-left corner and avoid getting trapped by the walls. Monitor enemy movement; if they move aggressively towards the center, I may need to defend.\n\nLEFT",

When I move, the tail moves to the position of the second-to-last segment, (6, 4).\n\n**1. Evaluate immediate safety for each direction:**\n- **UP (3, 9):** Empty on the board (though the apple list includes (3, 9)). No wall collision. No body collision. **Safe.**\n- **DOWN (3, 7):** Empty on the board. No body collision. **Safe.**\n- **LEFT (2, 8):** Empty on the board. No wall collision (x=0 is left boundary). No body collision. **Safe.**\n- **RIGHT (4, 8):** This is my current neck (first body segment). Moving right would move my head into my own body. **DEADLY.**\n\n**2. Evaluate strategic viability (apples and future):**\n- **UP (3, 9):** Contains an apple. Moving here grows my snake. From (3, 9), I can go Left (2, 9), Down (3, 8 - my old neck), or Right (4, 9). (2, 9) is an apple (on list). (4, 9) is an apple. However, (3, 9) is on the top wall. I lose the \"Down\" option for subsequent moves, leaving only Left/Right/Up (but Up is wall).\n- **LEFT (2, 8):** Empty. From (2, 8), I can go Left (1, 8), Up (2, 9 - apple), or Down (2, 7). This keeps me central.\n- **DOWN (3, 7):** Empty. From (3, 7), I can go Left (2, 7), Up (3, 8 - old neck), Right (4, 7 - empty), or Down (3, 6 - empty). This is very open.\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis:**\n- Snake #1 is at Head (0, 4), Body [(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), ...].\n- Enemy Head (0, 4) is 3 units away in Manhattan distance (|3-0| + |8-4| = 3+4 = 7).\n- The enemy is likely moving away from me or towards apples (0, 7), (0, 8).\n- My potential move UP (3, 9) puts me on the wall. If the enemy moves right/up aggressively, I might get trapped against the wall or have limited dodging space.\n- My potential move LEFT (2, 8) or DOWN (3, 7) keeps me more central and maintains more maneuverability.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nAlthough UP offers an apple immediately, being on the wall (y=9) limits my long-term survival and dodging capabilities. (3, 8) is also an apple (per the list: (3,0), (5,2), (6,1)... wait, checking the list again: `(7, 1), (3, 0), (5, 2), (8, 9), (6, 9), (0, 7), (9, 6), (9, 0), (7, 0), (3, 9), (0, 8), (6, 1), (4, 3), (6, 6), (2, 9)`).\n\nActually, looking at the list, (3, 8) is NOT an apple. (3, 9) IS an apple. (2, 9) IS an apple.\nWait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\nRow 8: `A . . 0 T . . . . .`\nThis corresponds to (0,8)=A, (1,8)=., (2,8)=., (3,8)=0 (my head), (4,8)=T (my body).\nSo (3,8) is NOT an apple.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the moves based on the apples provided in the list, as the board representation might be simplified or the list is the source of truth for apple locations. The prompt says \"Apples at: [list]\".\n\n- **UP (3, 9):** Apple is in the list. Good.\n- **LEFT (2, 8):** Not in list. Empty space.\n- **DOWN (3, 7):** Not in list. Empty space.\n\nHowever, I must balance eating now vs survival.\nIf I go UP to (3, 9), I eat. But I am on the wall.\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 8), I don't eat, but I open up (2, 9) (Apple) and (1, 8) (Empty).\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 7), I don't eat, but I open up (3, 6) (Empty) and (4, 7) (Empty).\n\nGiven the enemy is in the bottom-left (0,4) and I am at (3,8), moving UP to the wall puts me in a corner-like position (top edge). If the enemy decides to chase or if I get cut off, I have fewer escape routes. Moving LEFT or DOWN keeps me central.\nHowever, eating an apple is crucial for score (I have 8, enemy has 9).\n\nLet's look at the board state carefully.\nRow 9: `9 . . A A . . A . A .`\nCoordinates: (0,9)=., (1,9)=., (2,9)=A, (3,9)=A, (4,9)=A, (5,9)=., (6,9)=., (7,9)=A, (8,9)=., (9,9)=A.\nWait, the prompt lists (8,9) as an apple, but the board row 9 shows (8,9) as '.'.\nThe prompt says \"Apples at: ...\" and then gives a board state.\nUsually, the list is the ground truth.\nList includes: (3,9), (8,9), (6,9), (2,9).\nThe board row 9 shows A at (2,9), (3,9), (4,9) is A? No, row 9 says `9 . . A A . . A . A .`\n(0,9) is '.'.\n(1,9) is '.'.\n(2,9) is 'A'.\n(3,9) is 'A'.\n(4,9) is 'A' (Wait, list has (3,9) and (6,9), not (4,9)? List has (3,9) and (4,3), (6,6), etc. List has (4,3) but NOT (4,9). List has (6,9) but NOT (4,9)).\nOkay, the list says (3,9) is an apple.\nSo UP to (3,9) eats an apple.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe enemy has 9 apples, I have 8. I need to close the gap.\n(3,9) is an apple. Taking it puts me at 9, equalizing the score.\nFrom (3,9), I can go LEFT to (2,9) (which is also an apple per the list and board). Then to (1,9) or (3,8). (1,9) is a wall. (3,8) is my old body (safe to move into after 1 turn).\nActually, from (3,9) -> (2,9) -> (1,9) is a wall.\nPath: (3,9) -> (2,9) -> (2,8) or (1,9) (wall).\nWait, (1,9) is x=1, y=9. That is valid.\nRow 9: `9 . . A A . . A . A .`\n(0,9) is '.' (Empty).\n(1,9) is '.' (Empty).\nSo I can go (3,9) -> (2,9) -> (1,9) -> (0,9).\n(0,9) is an apple? No, (0,9) is empty on board. List has (0,8) and (0,7).\n(0,8) is an apple (List).\nSo I can sweep the top row: (3,9) -> (2,9) -> (1,9) -> (0,9) -> (0,8).\nThis is a strong plan.\n\nIs there a trap?\nMy body is at (4,8), (4,7)... (6,3).\nIf I go UP to (3,9), my body moves to [(3,8), (4,8), (4,7)...].\nIf I go LEFT to (2,8), I am moving away from my body.\n\nLet's compare safety:\n- **UP (3,9):** Wall at y=10. No body. Apple.\n- **LEFT (2,8):** Open. No body. No apple.\n- **DOWN (3,7):** Open. No body. No apple.\n\nThe enemy is at (0,4).\nIf the enemy moves UP towards (0,7) or (0,8), it will take time to reach me.\nIf I take the top row apples (3,9) -> (2,9) -> (1,9) -> (0,9), I am relatively safe from the enemy which is at y=4.\nHowever, the enemy could turn up at (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (0,5) -> (0,6) -> (0,7) -> (0,8).\nI am at (3,9) -> (2,9) -> (1,9) -> (0,9).\nIf I am at (0,9) and enemy is at (0,8), I am safe (Distance 1). If enemy moves to (0,9), I die (Head-on collision or him hitting me).\nBut the enemy is 4 steps away from (0,8) (Distance |0-0| + |4-8| = 4). I am 1 step away from (0,9) via (1,9).\nSo I will reach the top-left corner well before the enemy.\n\nWhat about the wall trap?\nIf I go UP to (3,9), I am on the wall.\nIf I then go LEFT to (2,9), I am still on the wall.\nIf I then go LEFT to (1,9), I am still on the wall.\nIf I then go LEFT to (0,9), I am in the corner.\nFrom (0,9), my only move is DOWN (0,8) or RIGHT (1,9).\n(0,8) is an apple.\n(1,9) is empty.\nThis is a safe exit.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to go UP?\nThe enemy is at (0,4). He is not an immediate threat.\nThe apples at (3,9) and (2,9) are available.\n(4,9) is NOT an apple (per list, but board shows A. List has (3,9), (6,9), (8,9), (4,3). No (4,9)).\nWait, Board Row 9: `9 . . A A . . A . A .`\n(4,9) is 'A' on the board.\nList: `(3, 9)` is in the list. `(4, 3)` is in the list.\nIs (4,9) an apple? The list doesn't explicitly say (4,9), but the board shows A at (4,9).\nThe prompt says \"Apples at: [List]\".\nThe board is a visual representation.\nGiven the list is explicitly provided, I should trust the list.\nHowever, if the board shows A, it's likely an apple.\nAssuming the board is correct, (3,9), (4,9) are apples.\nIf I go UP to (3,9), I eat.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,9), I eat.\nBut (4,9) is on the wall.\nAnd (4,9) is adjacent to my body (4,8).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,9), my body moves to [(4,8), (4,7)...].\nIf I am at (4,9) and body is at (4,8), I can move LEFT (back to 4,8) which is safe (body moves away), or UP/WALL, or RIGHT/WALL, or (5,9) (Wall).\nWait, (5,9) is a wall.\nSo from (4,9) I am effectively trapped on the wall with only one exit (Left).\nFrom (3,9), I have Left (2,9), Down (3,8), Right (4,9).\n(2,9) is an apple (List and Board).\n(3,8) is empty.\n(4,9) is an apple (Board).\nSo (3,9) gives me more options than (4,9).\nTherefore, UP to (3,9) is better than RIGHT to (4,9).\n\nWhat about LEFT or DOWN?\nThese are safe moves but do not eat an apple immediately. I am currently trailing the enemy 8 to 9. I need to eat.\nI should take the guaranteed apple at (3,9).\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nEat (3,9). Next turn, I will likely move LEFT to (2,9) to eat that apple as well, or sweep the top row.\n\n**Move:** UP\n**Reason:** Secures an apple (3,9) to match the enemy's score (9 apples). Maintains a central position relative to the top edge, allowing a sweep of the top-left apples ((2,9), (0,8), (0,7)). Moving LEFT or DOWN delays eating and allows the enemy to extend their lead. Moving RIGHT traps me against the wall immediately with fewer escape routes than UP.\n\nUP",

Moving DOWN takes me to (3,8). This is directly backwards. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **LEFT:** To (2, 9).\n        *   (2, 9) is empty.\n        *   No wall collision.\n        *   No body collision.\n        *   **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** To (4, 9).\n        *   (4, 9) is an Apple (visually confirmed).\n        *   No wall collision.\n        *   No body collision (Body starts at (3, 8)).\n        *   **Safe.**\n\n3.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   I must choose between **LEFT** to (2, 9) or **RIGHT** to (4, 9).\n    *   **Right to (4, 9):**\n        *   Eats an apple (Good for score).\n        *   Positions me at (4, 9). From there, I can go LEFT (back to 3,9), RIGHT (5,9 - Wall), UP (4,10 - Wall), or DOWN (4,8 - Body).\n        *   If I eat at (4, 9), my body length increases. Next turn, my body will fill (4, 8), (3, 8), etc.\n        *   If I am at (4, 9) and my body is at (4, 8), I cannot go DOWN (into body) or UP/WALL or RIGHT/WALL. My *only* safe move next turn would be LEFT to (3, 9). This is a \"trap\" scenario where I am forced into a specific move, limiting my ability to dodge the enemy or reach other apples.\n    *   **Left to (2, 9):**\n        *   Does not eat an apple immediately.\n        *   Positions me at (2, 9).\n        *   From (2, 9), I can go LEFT (1, 9 - Empty), RIGHT (3, 9 - Apple), UP (2, 10 - Wall), or DOWN (2, 8 - Empty).\n        *   This keeps my options open. I can sweep the top row towards the corner (0, 9), which is empty and leads to (0, 8) (Apple).\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:**\n        *   Enemy is at (0, 5). They are moving towards apples at (0, 7) or (0, 8).\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (4, 9), I trap myself against the wall, making it harder to avoid the enemy if they decide to push up the right side (unlikely but possible) or if I just need maneuvering room.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (2, 9), I stay mobile.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    While (4, 9) is an apple, moving there reduces my maneuverability significantly for the next turn. Moving to (2, 9) keeps my future options open (can go to (1,9) -> (0,9) -> (0,8) for apples, or back to (3,9)). Since the enemy is far away (distance 4+ vertical), I have time to collect apples safely. Preserving mobility is safer than taking an apple that leads to a forced move.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (2, 9). From there, continue Left to (1, 9) and (0, 9) to sweep the top edge and access (0, 8) safely. Avoid the trap of the right-hand wall.\n\nLEFT",

Their most probable moves are UP to (0, 7) or (0, 8) (if they eat the apple at 7, they might overshoot to 8 if they are greedy, but likely (0, 7) is the immediate target). If they move UP to (0, 7), their body shifts up, leaving (0, 0) and (1, 0) trailing. If they move RIGHT to (1, 6), they open the top-left area but abandon the apples. Given their position, an UP move is the highest probability.\n\n3.  **Available Moves from Head (2, 9):**\n    *   **UP:** (2, 10) -> Out of bounds. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (2, 8) -> Currently empty (Apple at (2,8) is not listed in the apple list; checking the board row 8: `A . . T T . . . . .`. (2,8) is an Apple!). Wait, let's re-read the apple list carefully.\n        *   Apple List: `(7, 1), (3, 0), (5, 2), (8, 9), (6, 9), (0, 7), (9, 6), (9, 0), (7, 0), (0, 8), (6, 1), (4, 3), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 4)`\n        *   Board Row 8 (`y=8`): `A . . T T . . . . .` -> (0,8) is an Apple (matches list). (2,8) is shown as a dot/empty space.\n        *   My Body: The cell directly behind my head is (3, 9). (2, 8) is diagonal, not directly behind.\n        *   Is (2, 8) occupied by a snake? No. Is it a wall? No.\n        *   **Result:** Safe. (2,8) is empty.\n    *   **LEFT:** (1, 9) -> Empty. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (3, 9) -> This is my neck (the first body segment). Moving here is a collision with myself. **DEADLY.** (Note: My body list starts with (3, 9) after the head moved to (2,9)).\n\n4.  **Strategy & Comparison:**\n    *   **Move DOWN to (2, 8):**\n        *   Position: (2, 8).\n        *   Next Turn Options from (2, 8): LEFT (1, 8), DOWN (2, 7), RIGHT (3, 8 - Enemy Body? No, Enemy is at x=0. 3,8 is my body? My body is at (3,9) etc. 3,8 is an Apple on the board map? Board Row 8 shows `T` at index 3. (3,8) is an obstacle, likely part of my body that hasn't been updated on the map or a wall). Let's look at my body: (3,9), (3,8)... YES, (3,8) is my body. So I cannot go RIGHT.\n        *   However, (2, 8) is very close to the enemy's potential path (0, 6 -> 0, 7 -> 0, 8 -> 1, 8 -> 2, 8). If the enemy goes for the apple at (0, 8) and then moves right, I could get boxed in.\n    *   **Move LEFT to (1, 9):**\n        *   Position: (1, 9).\n        *   Next Turn Options from (1, 9): LEFT (0, 9), DOWN (1, 8), RIGHT (2, 9 - Empty).\n        *   **Analysis:** (0, 9) is empty. (1, 8) is empty (Row 8: `A . .` -> index 1 is empty). (2, 9) is empty.\n        *   **Advantage:** This keeps me on the top edge. The top row (y=9) has apples at (8,9) and (6,9). By moving LEFT to (1,9), I am moving away from the enemy (who is at x=0, y=6) towards the top-right corner, which is safer and has apples. I can then traverse (0,9) -> (0,8) or (1,9) -> (2,9) -> ... towards (6,9).\n        *   **Enemy Interaction:** If the enemy moves UP to (0,7) or (0,8), I am safely on the top row moving away. If they move RIGHT to (1,6), I am still on row 9, safe.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   Moving DOWN to (2, 8) places me directly above the enemy's column (x=0) and below the row where I have body parts (y=9). It restricts my future movement more than staying on the top row.\n    *   Moving LEFT to (1, 9) maximizes my future moves and safety. It allows me to sweep the top edge for apples (8,9) and (6,9) while keeping distance from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move to the top-left corner (0,9) or sweep right along the top edge to collect (8,9) and (6,9). Maintain distance from the enemy at the bottom-left.\n\nLEFT",

I am at (1,8). We don't collide.\n            *   If Enemy is at (0,8), they might move RIGHT to (1,8). This is a collision.\n            *   However, the enemy has apples at (0,8) and (0,9). Staying on the x=0 column is their likely path. Moving RIGHT to (1,8) is risky for them because they would have to turn back or cross my potential path.\n        *   **Strategy:** Moving DOWN to (1,8) allows me to descend towards the center of the board, opening up the right side where apples are located ((4,3), (5,2), (6,1), (7,1), (3,0), etc.). It avoids the immediate trap of the top-left corner.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move DOWN to (1,8) to open up mobility. I need to avoid the enemy in the top-left and work my way around to the apples in the center and bottom-right. Avoid getting cornered on the top edge.\n\nDOWN",

If the enemy stays at (0, 9) (or moves elsewhere), I am safe. If the enemy decides to move DOWN from (0, 9) to (0, 8), we collide and both die.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Eating an apple is always good. It grows my tail, potentially blocking the enemy's path behind them. It puts me adjacent to the enemy, which is risky, but the enemy is trapped in the corner (0, 9) and can only move DOWN (to where I am) or DOWN-LEFT (impossible). If I move LEFT, I occupy their only escape route (0, 8).\n    *   **DOWN:** (1, 7).\n        *   **Check:** (1, 7) appears empty on the board (Row 7: `T . . . T . . . . .`).\n        *   **Safety:** Check enemy body parts. (1, 7) is not in the likely enemy body list.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me deeper into the board. (1, 7) is relatively open, connecting to the central region. It avoids immediate conflict with the enemy.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (2, 8).\n        *   **Check:** (2, 8) is empty.\n        *   **Safety:** No immediate threats.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Opens up the right side of the board.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   **UP** is suicidal (into my own neck).\n    *   **LEFT** (0, 8) is a high-risk, high-reward move. If the enemy stays at (0, 9), I eat the apple safely and block them. If the enemy moves DOWN to (0, 8), we both die. Given the enemy has 11 apples (I have 10), a mutual death is effectively a loss for me (since I am behind). The enemy is likely greedy for apples; they are at (0, 9), which is an apple. They will likely eat it. If they eat (0, 9), they might not move immediately.\n    *   **DOWN** (1, 7) and **RIGHT** (2, 8) are safe moves.\n    *   **Comparison:** (2, 8) is on the edge of the central block. (1, 7) is slightly more central but adjacent to the column of 'T's at x=0? No, x=0 is occupied by enemy. x=1, y=7 is open.\n    *   **Refined Strategy:** The enemy is cornered at (0,9). If I move LEFT, I force a confrontation. If the enemy is smart, they might predict I'll go for the apple and move DOWN to (0,8) to kill me. Since I am trailing in score, trading lives is bad for me.\n    *   Therefore, I should play it safe and maneuver around the central area to find other apples.\n    *   Looking at the board, there are apples at (4,3), (5,2), (7,1), (3,0) in the lower-left/center. (6,6), (7,6), (7,4) in the center-right.\n    *   From (1, 8), moving DOWN to (1, 7) is a solid step towards the center and the apples at (4,3) and (3,0).\n    *   **Moving DOWN to (1, 7)** allows me to descend and potentially loop around. It keeps distance from the cornered enemy at (0,9).\n    *   **Wait, reconsidering (0,8):** The enemy has 11 apples. I have 10. If I die, I lose. If I kill the enemy (by moving into their path while they die), I win immediately. If I move to (0,8) and the enemy moves to (0,8), we both die. If I move to (0,8) and the enemy stays at (0,9) or moves to (1,9), I eat the apple (11 apples) and grow. This narrows the gap.\n    *   However, the enemy is at (0,9). The only move for them that causes a collision with me at (0,8) is DOWN. It's very likely they will move DOWN eventually if they want to live. If I move to (0,8), I am sitting there waiting for them to drop on my head next turn? No, we move simultaneously.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (0,8) *this turn*:\n        *   Enemy moves from (0,9). Options: DOWN to (0,8) -> **COLLISION**. RIGHT to (1,9) -> **COLLISION** (My body is at 1,9). The only safe move for Enemy if I am at (0,8) is... none. They are trapped.\n        *   Wait, if I move to (0,8), my tail (5,4) moves. My body shifts. My old head (1,8) becomes body. My tail (5,4) vacates.\n        *   Enemy at (0,9). If Enemy moves DOWN to (0,8): Collision.\n        *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (1,9): Collision (I am currently at 1,8 moving to 0,8. My body will occupy 1,9? No. My head is 1,8. My body is 1,9... (1,9) is the second segment? No, my body list is [(1,9), (2,9)...].\n            *   Current body: (1,9), (2,9), (3,9)...\n            *   If I move to (0,8): New body: (1,8), (1,9), (2,9)...\n            *   So (1,9) is occupied by my body.\n            *   Enemy moving from (0,9) to (1,9) would collide with my body.\n        *   **Conclusion:** If I move to (0,8), the Enemy at (0,9) has NO safe moves. They are trapped. They will die next turn unless they kill me this turn (which kills them too).\n        *   This is a winning move. I gain an apple. I trap the enemy. Even if they kill me, it's a tie (both dead). But since I gain an apple, if I die immediately after, the score is 11-11, but the game ends with \"all opponents dead\" (if they die on the same turn?) No, if we both die, game over. Score check. I have 10 -> 11. Enemy 11. If we tie, I lose? No, if both die, it's a draw or score check. If both die on the same turn, the one with more apples wins. If tied, draw.\n            *   Wait, if we collide: Both dead. I have 11 apples, Enemy has 11 apples. **DRAW**.\n            *   Is a draw better than a loss? Yes. Is it better than a potential win? No.\n            *   However, if I don't take the apple, Enemy might take it. Enemy 12, Me 10.\n            *   If I take the apple, Enemy is trapped. If they move DOWN to (0,8), we draw. If they move RIGHT to (1,9), we draw.\n            *   Is there any move where I survive?\n            *   If Enemy realizes they are trapped, they might move... wait. If I move to (0,8), Enemy is at (0,9).\n            *   Enemy moves DOWN to (0,8): Collision. Both die.\n            *   Enemy moves RIGHT to (1,9): Collision (my body at 1,9). Both die.\n            *   Enemy is dead no matter what they do.\n            *   What do I do?\n            *   I move to (0,8). I eat the apple. My score becomes 11.\n            *   Enemy dies.\n            *   **Wait, if Enemy dies, I win immediately.**\n            *   Does it matter if I die? \"If all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\"\n            *   If we collide, I am not alive. The game ends. \"If all snakes die on the same turn... game ends immediately... snake with more apples wins.\"\n            *   If we collide, we both die. Score 11-11. Draw.\n            *   Is there a way to avoid collision?\n            *   No. Enemy is at (0,9). I am at (1,8). I move to (0,8).\n            *   Enemy has no safe squares.\n            *   Wait, can the enemy move to (1,9)? Yes.\n            *   Can I avoid (1,9)? My body is at (1,9).\n            *   If Enemy moves to (1,9), they hit my body. They die. I live.\n            *   Do I live? Yes. My head is at (0,8). Enemy head at (1,9). No collision.\n            *   Wait, is (1,9) occupied by my body?\n            *   Yes. My current body is [(1,9), (2,9)...].\n            *   If I move to (0,8), my new body is [(1,8), (1,9), (2,9)...].\n            *   So (1,9) is occupied by my body.\n            *   If Enemy moves to (1,9), they die.\n            *   If Enemy moves to (0,8), they collide with me. We both die.\n            *   If Enemy moves to (0,9) (stays)? No, they can't stay. They must move.\n            *   Enemy has NO safe moves. They are forced to move into a death square.\n            *   If they move to (1,9) (my body), they die. I live.\n            *   If they move to (0,8) (my head), we die. Draw.\n            *   Will the enemy choose a draw or death?\n            *   They will probably choose the move that *might* be safe if my body wasn't there. But my body IS there.\n            *   Unless the enemy thinks my body moved?\n            *   My body moves: Tail (5,4) is removed. Head (1,8) becomes part of body.\n            *   New Body: (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9)...\n            *   (1,9) is definitely occupied.\n            *   So Enemy moving to (1,9) dies.\n            *   Enemy moving to (0,8) dies (collides with me).\n            *   Therefore, if I move to (0,8), the enemy is guaranteed to die.\n            *   The only risk is if they move to (0,8) -> Draw. If they move to (1,9) -> They die, I win.\n            *   Since the enemy wants to win, they might try to force a draw? Or they might misjudge and move to (1,9) thinking it's open?\n            *   Regardless, I am guaranteed to get the apple (11 points). And I am guaranteed to end the opponent's turn (either dead or drawn).\n            *   Actually, if they move to (0,8), we collide. Draw.\n            *   Is there a better move?\n            *   Moving DOWN (1,7) is safe, but leaves the apple for the enemy (if they can reach it). But they are trapped at (0,9). They can't reach (0,8) if I go there? No, they are at (0,9). They can reach (0,8) by moving down.\n            *   If I don't take the apple, enemy takes it. They get 12. I am at 10. Gap widens.\n            *   If I take the apple, I get 11.\n            *   If I take the apple, I block the enemy's exit.\n            *   This looks like the best aggressive play.\n            *   Let's double check the coordinates.\n            *   My head: (1,8). Target: (0,8).\n            *   Enemy head: (0,9).\n            *   Enemy moves: (0,8), (1,9).\n            *   My move to (0,8) guarantees I get the apple.\n            *   Collision possibilities:\n                *   Enemy -> (0,8): Collision. Draw. (11-11).\n                *   Enemy -> (1,9): Enemy hits my body. Enemy dies. I win. (11-11 score? No, I win).\n            *   Wait, if enemy dies, I win immediately. The score doesn't matter (unless we both die).\n            *   So if Enemy moves to (1,9), I win.\n            *   If Enemy moves to (0,8), we tie.\n            *   Is there any scenario where I die and enemy lives?\n            *   No. Enemy is trapped.\n            *   Therefore, moving LEFT is the winning move. It either secures an immediate win or a draw (which is better than losing).\n            *   If I move DOWN or RIGHT, I give up the apple and the strategic advantage.\n            *   **Re-reading rules:** \"If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins\".\n            *   If we collide: I have 11, Enemy has 11. Draw.\n            *   If I force them to hit my body: I win.\n            *   I must take the apple.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating safety of (0,8):**\n        *   Is (0,8) currently occupied? No.\n        *   Is it an apple? Yes.\n        *   Is it a trap? It is a corner-adjacent square.\n        *   However, the enemy is already in the corner. By moving there, *I* trap *them*.\n        *   The only danger is the enemy moving to (0,8) and killing us both.\n        *   But the enemy has a choice: Move to (0,8) (Draw) or Move to (1,9) (Die).\n        *   A rational player will choose the move that keeps them alive. (1,9) kills them. (0,8) kills them (collides with me).\n        *   Wait, if I move to (0,8), and Enemy moves to (1,9), does Enemy die?\n        *   My body occupies (1,9). Yes.\n        *   So Enemy dies.\n        *   So Enemy has NO survival path.\n        *   They will likely try to kill me (move to 0,8) to force a draw rather than a loss.\n        *   If they force a draw, the game continues? No, \"all snakes die... game ends\".\n            *   Wait, if both die, the game ends.\n            *   If the game ends in a draw, we proceed to the next turn? No, the round ends. \"The game ends immediately... if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\" This implies the match is a draw.\n            *   I want to win.\n            *   If I move LEFT, I guarantee I don't lose (Draw or Win).\n            *   If I move DOWN, I guarantee I don't die this turn, but I lose momentum.\n            *   Let's look at the board again.\n            *   There are many apples. Losing 1 point (Draw vs Win) is better than losing 2 points (Enemy 12, Me 10).\n            *   Actually, if I move LEFT and we Draw (both die), it's a draw match. If I move DOWN and play the long game, I might win.\n            *   However, if I move LEFT and the enemy is stupid and moves to (1,9), I win immediately.\n            *   If the enemy is smart, they will move to (0,8) to force a draw.\n            *   Is there a third option? No.\n            *   So, moving LEFT guarantees a Draw or Win. Moving elsewhere guarantees I don't get the apple and the enemy might escape the corner (if I don't block them).\n            *   Wait, if I don't block them, they can escape the corner.\n            *   If I move LEFT, I am blocking their only exit (assuming they can't go through my body).\n            *   If I move LEFT to (0,8), I am effectively ending the game for Snake #1.\n            *   This is a very strong tactical move.\n            *   Let's assume the worst case: Enemy moves to (0,8). Collision. Both die.\n            *   Score: 11-11. Draw.\n            *   Is this acceptable? Yes, because the alternative (not moving left) allows the enemy to score (12-10) and potentially kill me later.\n            *   But \"Draw\" is not a win.\n            *   Is there any way to NOT draw?\n            *   Only if the enemy moves to (1,9) and dies.\n            *   Will they?\n            *   Probably not. They will see the trap and try to draw.\n            *   However, let's look closer at the board state.\n            *   Row 9: `. 0 T T . . . A . A .`\n            *   My body at (1,9) and (2,9).\n            *   Enemy at (0,9).\n            *   If I move to (0,8), I am safe from my own body.\n            *   The enemy is at (0,9).\n            *   If the enemy moves to (1,9), they hit my body.\n            *   If the enemy moves to (0,8), they hit me.\n            *   There is NO safe square for the enemy.\n            *   Therefore, the enemy is dead.\n            *   If the enemy is dead, I win.\n            *   Wait, \"If all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\"\n            *   If we collide, I am not alive.\n            *   If they hit my body, they are dead, I am alive.\n            *   So, I need them to hit my body.\n            *   Why would they do that?\n            *   They wouldn't. They would choose the collision to force a draw.\n            *   So, moving LEFT forces a draw.\n            *   Is there a better move?\n            *   Moving DOWN (1,7).\n            *   Enemy at (0,9) moves to (0,8) (eating apple). Enemy score 12.\n            *   Now Enemy is at (0,8). I am at (1,7).\n            *   Next turn, Enemy can move to (0,7) or (1,8).\n            *   I am safe.\n            *   However, I gave up the apple.\n            *   Let's compare Draw vs Score Loss.\n            *   Draw = Match Draw.\n            *   Score Loss = I am behind 12-10.\n            *   In a Snake game, being behind is bad.\n            *   But a Draw is also bad (I want to Win).\n            *   Is there a move that *guarantees* a win?\n            *   No. Moving LEFT guarantees a Draw (worst case) or Win (best case).\n            *   Moving DOWN guarantees I survive, but cedes advantage.\n            *   Wait, if I move DOWN, the enemy might not be able to reach the apple? No, they are standing on it (0,9) -> (0,8).\n            *   Okay, let's look at the \"Last Move Rationale\" from the prompt.\n            *   My previous move was DOWN.\n            *   My head is (1,8).\n            *   My body is (1,9)... (5,4).\n            *   Enemy is (0,8) or (0,9)?\n            *   Prompt says: \"Enemy likely moved UP to eat the apple at (0,7)\". Wait, the prompt says \"Enemy likely moved UP to eat the apple at (0, 7)\". But the apples list has (0,1), (9,2)... no (0,7) in the provided list.\n            *   Let's check the apples list again.\n            *   Apples: (7, 1), (3, 0), (5, 2), (8, 9), (6, 9), (9, 6), (9, 0), (7, 0), (6, 1), (4, 3), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 4), (0, 1), (9, 2).\n            *   (0, 7) is NOT an apple.\n            *   (0, 8) is NOT an apple.\n            *   (0, 9) is NOT an apple.\n            *   So the enemy is NOT chasing an apple at (0,7).\n            *   The enemy is at (0,8) (my assumption from last turn).\n            *   The apples near the enemy are (0, 1) and (9, 2) (far away).\n            *   The enemy is likely just moving up to the corner (0,9) for safety.\n            *   If the enemy is moving to (0,9), they are not chasing an apple.\n            *   So, if I move LEFT to (0,8), the enemy is at (0,9).\n            *   The enemy is NOT on an apple. They are just in the corner.\n            *   The apple is at (0, 1).\n            *   So the enemy has no immediate apple reward for being at (0,9).\n            *   Why is the enemy at (0,8) or (0,9)?\n            *   If the enemy is at (0,9), they are trapped.\n            *   If I move to (0,8), I trap them further.\n            *   They have no apples to eat there.\n            *   They are just trying to survive.\n            *   If I move to (0,8), I eat... wait, is there an apple at (0,8)?\n            *   Apples list: No.\n            *   Board map: Row 8 shows `. 0 . . . . . . . .`? No, Row 8: `1 0 . T T . . . . . .`\n            *   Index 0 is `1` (Enemy head). Index 1 is `0` (My head).\n            *   Row 9: `. 0 T T . . . A .

(0, 9) is empty.\n            *   There is NO apple at (0, 8) or (0, 9).\n            *   Wait, the prompt said \"Apples at: ...\". I checked. No apples in the top left corner.\n            *   Why did I think there was an apple at (0,8)?\n            *   \"Apples at: ... (0, 1) ...\" No (0,8).\n            *   Okay, so moving LEFT to (0,8) does NOT give me an apple.\n            *   It is just a move into the corner.\n            *   This changes everything.\n            *   If I move LEFT to (0,8), I am moving into a corner, no apple.\n            *   Enemy is likely at (0,9).\n            *   If Enemy stays at (0,9) (or moves), we might collide.\n            *   If I move to (0,8), I am stuck in the corner.\n            *   This is a BAD move. It's a corner trap for ME.\n            *   The previous rationale (in the prompt) was wrong about apples. It assumed an apple at (0,8). There isn't one.\n            *   So, I must NOT move LEFT.\n            *   I am at (1,8).\n            *   My moves:\n            *   UP (1,9): Into my own neck. Dead.\n            *   LEFT (0,8): Corner trap. Dead (eventually or immediately).\n            *   DOWN (1,7): Safe. Open space.\n            *   RIGHT (2,8): Safe.\n            *   The enemy is likely at (0,8) or (0,9).\n            *   If Enemy is at (0,8), they might move UP to (0,9) or RIGHT to (1,8).\n            *   If Enemy is at (0,9), they might move DOWN to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,9).\n            *   If I move DOWN to (1,7), I avoid all these interactions.\n            *   If I move RIGHT to (2,8), I am adjacent to my own body at (2,9)? No, (2,8) is empty.\n            *   Let's look at the board map again.\n            *   Row 8: `1 0 .

Yes, (3,8) is in my body list).\n            *   So if I move to (2,8), I am adjacent to my body at (2,9) and (3,8).\n            *   That is fine, I am not occupying those squares.\n            *   However, looking at the board, there is an apple at (4,3).\n            *   (1,7) -> (2,6) -> (3,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3). (4,4) is blocked by my body? No, my body is at (4,4)? Yes.\n            *   My body: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)...\n            *   So I cannot go to (4,4).\n            *   I need to go around.\n            *   From (1,7), I can go to (2,6).\n            *   From (2,8), I can go to (2,7).\n            *   Let's look at the bottom left area.\n            *   Apples at (3,0), (7,0), (9,0), (0,1), (6,1), (7,1), (5,2).\n            *   These are accessible from the bottom.\n            *   My body is at (4,4) and above. This blocks the path from y=4 to y=3 in the x=4 column.\n            *   I need to get down.\n            *   (1,8) -> (1,7) -> (1,6) -> (1,5) -> (1,4)...\n            *   (1,4) is empty? Row 4: `T . . . T T . A . .`\n            *   (0,4) is T. (4,4) is T. (5,4) is T.\n            *   (1,4) is `.`.\n            *   So I can go down the x=1 column.\n            *   This seems like a solid plan: Descend the x=1 column to reach the lower apples.\n            *   Moving DOWN to (1,7) is the first step of that.\n            *   Moving RIGHT to (2,8) takes me into the \"T\" block at x=3,4?\n            *   No, x=2 is mostly open.\n            *   But descending is generally safer and opens up more space (bottom of board).\n            *   Also, if I move DOWN, I am moving away from the enemy (who is likely at x=0).\n            *   If I move RIGHT, I am moving closer to the center.\n            *   The enemy is at x=0. They are weak. I should secure the bottom/side.\n            *   Also, moving DOWN avoids the immediate \"neck\" check.\n            *   Let's verify (1,7) is safe.\n            *   Is it occupied? Board says `.`.\n            *   Is it an apple? No (Apples list).\n            *   Is it an enemy body? No.\n            *   Is it my body? No.\n            *   Is it safe from enemy head?\n            *   Enemy likely at (0,8) or (0,9).\n            *   From (0,8), enemy can move to (1,8). I am at (1,7). Safe.\n            *   From (0,9), enemy can move to (1,9). I am at (1,7). Safe.\n            *   So (1,7) is safe.\n            *   Moving DOWN seems the most logical step to open up the bottom half of the board.\n\n**Strategy:**\nDescend the x=1 column to reach the abundant apples in the bottom half of the board ((0,1), (6,1), (7,1), (3,0), etc.). Avoid the top-left corner where the enemy is.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "Based on the analysis of the current game state, turn 25/150:\n\n**Board State Analysis:**\n- **Current Position:** My head is at `(1, 7)`.\n- **Board Geography:** The board is divided by a wall of 'T' (territory/obstacle) at columns 0 and 3-4. The left side (x=0-2) is relatively open vertically, while the right side (x=5-9) is more open horizontally.\n- **My Trajectory:** My body occupies the left side (x=1-4). I am currently descending the column at x=1 to reach the bottom apples.\n- **Target Apples:** The closest apples are at `(1, 6)`, `(6, 1)`, `(7, 1)`, `(3, 0)`, and `(0, 1)`.\n- **Enemy Status:** Snake #1 is at `(0, 9)`. They are effectively trapped in the top-left corner. They are far away and pose no immediate threat to my current location.\n\n**Move Evaluation (from `(1, 7)`):**\n1.  **UP to `(1, 8)`:**\n    - **Safety:** This is my previous head position. Since I just moved `DOWN` to `(1, 7)`, the cell `(1, 8)` is now the second segment of my body.\n    - **Outcome:** Moving into my own body is fatal. **Invalid move.**\n\n2.  **LEFT to `(0, 7)`:**\n    - **Safety:** `(0, 7)` is currently empty (Snake #1 moved from there or is elsewhere).\n    - **Strategic Value:** Moving to `x=0` restricts future movement to only Right or Vertical (Up/Down), as `x=-1` is out of bounds. This creates a \"corridor\" scenario.\n    - **Comparison:** Moving into the corner at `x=0` limits options compared to staying at `x=1` or moving to `x=2`.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to `(2, 7)`:**\n    - **Safety:** `(2, 7)` is currently empty.\n    - **Strategic Value:** This position is central. It allows movement to `x=1`, `x=3`, `y=6`, or `y=8`. It is adjacent to the 'T' wall at `(3, 7)`.\n    - **Comparison:** Maintains the option to go right towards the center or down towards the bottom apples.\n\n4.  **DOWN to `(1, 6)`:**\n    - **Safety:** `(1, 6)` is empty. `(1, 5)` and `(1, 4)` are also empty, opening a path down the column.\n    - **Strategic Value:** There is an apple at `(6, 1)` and `(3, 0)` in the bottom area. Descending along `x=1` keeps me in a safe vertical corridor. I can turn right at any point (e.g., at `y=1` or `y=0`) to enter the open bottom area.\n    - **Comparison:** This is the most direct path to the bottom apples while maintaining safety. It avoids the top-left corner where the enemy is trapped.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving `DOWN` to `(1, 6)` is the best choice. It proceeds along the safe vertical corridor `x=1`, avoiding the wall at `x=3-4` and the corner at `x=0`. It moves me closer to the apples in the lower half of the board.\n\nDOWN",
