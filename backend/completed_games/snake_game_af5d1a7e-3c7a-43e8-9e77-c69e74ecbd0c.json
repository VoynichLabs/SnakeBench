Let me read the situation:\n\n**The Setup:**\n- Me: Head at (4, 6) - nice central position!\n- Enemy: Head at (4, 3) - right below me, keeping it tight!\n- Both snakes are just heads right now, so we're both looking to grow\n- Board is wide open with apples EVERYWHERE - 15 apples scattered around!\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\nFrom my position at (4, 6), I can move:\n- **UP to (4, 7)** - pushing toward the top, maybe toward (3, 8) apple\n- **DOWN to (4, 5)** - getting closer to the enemy, moving toward (4, 1) apple\n- **LEFT to (3, 6)** - toward those apples at (2, 6) and (1, 5)\n- **RIGHT to (5, 6)** - toward (8, 6) apple\n\n**The Strategic Play:**\n\nThe enemy is directly below me at (4, 3). If I move DOWN to (4, 5), I'm getting CLOSER to them and putting pressure! This is AGGRESSIVE and plays to my advantage since we're both just heads right now.\n\nI see there's an apple at (4, 1) which is a straight shot down from me - DOWN gets me moving in that direction!\n\n**Why DOWN is \ud83d\udd25:**\n1. It's SAFE - no walls, no bodies, no collision risk\n2. It POSITIONS me toward a reachable apple at (4, 1)\n3. It keeps the pressure ON the enemy\n4. Multiple escape routes available from (4, 5) if things get spicy\n5. If the enemy moves UP and I move DOWN, I force them to reconsider their next move\n\nIf I go DOWN and they go UP, I'm boxing them in against the board edge while I have clear paths to apples! \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n- Control the center vertical axis (x=4)\n- Force the enemy toward the edges\n- Cut off their escape routes once I grow\n- Aim for that head-on collision if scores stay tied - I want the advantage!\n\nLet's get this bread and make them CRASH! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Body segments at (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 2) have them BOUND UP. They can only go RIGHT (toward us at x=4-7) or DOWN. They're playing scared while we play for keeps! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (7, 6):**\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 6)** - \ud83c\udf4e LET'S EAT!\n- There's an apple RIGHT THERE at (8, 6)!

I'm about to start COLLECTING and building that length advantage! While they're playing defensive snake in the corner, I'm going to:\n\n- GRIND those right-side apples: (8, 6), (8, 5), (7, 4), (9, 1)\n- BUILD length for the inevitable head-on collision\n- Keep the pressure on by staying on their side of the board\n- Force THEM to make mistakes while I play calculated snake\n\nThe score will flip, chat.

LEFT keeps me mobile!\n\n4. **CLOSING THE SCORE GAP!** 2-3 means we're ONE APPLE AWAY from tying! That apple at (7, 4) is CALLING my name!\n\n**THE ENEMY THREAT:**\nThe enemy is at (6, 1) with body segments at (5, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 2).

This is a tense situation, chat - we need to be SMART about this!\n\n**MY OPTIONS:**\n\n**UP to (7, 5)** - This space appears to be empty based on the board, but let me double-check... yeah, no snake occupies (7, 5). This could be a safe move!\n\n**DOWN to (7, 3)** - OH HELL NO! The enemy's head is at (7, 1) and their body is along the row y=1. If I go down to (7, 3), I'm NOT moving into the enemy head directly. BUT - the enemy could also move UP to (7, 2), and then on the NEXT turn they could threaten me more. More importantly, going down brings me CLOSER to the enemy which is RISKY.\n\n**LEFT to (6, 4)** - This looks like open space! Let me check if there's anything there... nope, looks clear!\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 4)** - That space is currently occupied by my own body segment! Moving RIGHT = moving into myself = DEATH. Absolutely NOT the play, chat! \ud83d\ude45\n\n**THE ENEMY THREAT:**\nThe enemy is at (7, 1) with body segments at (6, 1), (5, 1), and (4, 1). They're directly below me! The enemy can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. If the enemy moves UP to (7, 2), they're getting closer to my head. I need to be careful not to get trapped or force a bad collision.\n\n**WHERE SHOULD I GO?**\n\nLet me think about this strategically:\n\n1. **AVOID THE ENEMY!** The enemy is directly below me. I should move AWAY from them, not toward them. So going UP or LEFT makes more sense than going DOWN.\n\n2. **APPLE OPPORTUNITIES!** There's an apple at (8, 2) which is reachable, and (5, 7) is in the upper area. Going UP would put me in position to get to (5, 7) and the upper apple cluster.\n\n3. **BOARD COVERAGE!** From (7, 5) or (6, 4), I'd have more options and less chance of getting boxed in.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nUP to (7, 5) - This move takes me AWAY from the enemy, puts me in a safer position, and opens up access to the upper apple cluster including (5, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), and (0, 9)! I stay mobile and avoid getting trapped near the enemy!\n\nUP",

This is anyone's game right now, and I need to make some smart moves to DOMINATE this board!\n\n**WHERE ARE WE AT?**\n\nLet me break down the current situation:\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 1):**\n- Head chilling at (7, 5) - nice elevated position on the board!\n- Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)] - I'm holding down the fort in the right-center area\n- 3 apples collected - we're tied with the enemy!\n\n**THE ENEMY (Snake #0):**\n- Head at (7, 1) - they're positioned directly below me!\n- Body: [(7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)] - their body is stretched horizontally below me\n- 3 apples collected - they're playing it cool too\n\n**THE BOARD LAYOUT:**\n\nLooking at our positions, I'm at row 5 and they're at row 1. We're aligned vertically at column 7, which makes this SUPER interesting! The enemy is directly under me, chat. That's either a threat or an opportunity depending on how we play it!\n\n**MY MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n\nLet me analyze each direction from my current head position at (7, 5):\n\n**UP to (7, 6)** - Wait, hold up... I need to check the board again. Looking at row 6, position (7, 6) appears to be empty based on the board display. Row 6 shows: \". . A . . . . . . .\" which means positions (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6) are all empty! UP could be safe!\n\n**DOWN to (7, 4)** - OH HELL NO! That's where my body segment is! [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)] - position (7, 4) is literally my own body! Moving DOWN = moving into myself = INSTANT DEATH. Not happening!\n\n**LEFT to (6, 5)** - Let me check row 5... position (6, 5) appears empty. The board shows \". A . A . .\" which suggests positions around there are clear. LEFT looks like a viable option!\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 5)** - Hmm, wait... the body list shows [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)]. Position (8, 5) is showing \"T\" which represents the tail. So (8, 5) is occupied by MY OWN BODY! Moving RIGHT would be moving into myself, which is DEATH. Can't do it!\n\n**SO IT'S BETWEEN UP AND LEFT!** Both look safe, but which one gives me the better position?\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\n1. **APPLE OPPORTUNITIES:** There are apples at (8, 2), (5, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), and (0, 9) that I should be eyeing. The upper area has a nice cluster!\n\n2. **ENEMY THREAT:** The enemy at (7, 1) could potentially move UP to (7, 2) this turn. If I move UP to (7, 6), we're maintaining our vertical distance. If I move LEFT to (6, 5), I create some horizontal separation.\n\n3. **BOARD COVERAGE:** Moving LEFT to (6, 5) would position me more toward the center, which might give me more options long-term. But moving UP keeps me in the upper area where more apples are clustered!\n\n4. **ESCAPE ROUTES:** From (7, 6), I'd have LEFT, RIGHT, and UP as follow-up options. From (6, 5), I'd also have multiple escape routes. Both positions keep me mobile!\n\n**THE ENEMY'S LIKELY MOVE:**\n\nThe enemy at (7, 1) with body [(7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)] has limited options:\n- They could move UP toward me (to 7, 2)\n- They could move RIGHT to (8, 1)\n- They could move LEFT but that might be blocked\n- Moving DOWN would be off the board or into themselves\n\nIf they move UP, they're getting closer. But I'm playing it smart and staying mobile!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nLEFT to (6, 5) - This move takes me slightly away from our current vertical alignment while keeping me in the upper play area. From (6, 5), I maintain access to the apple cluster and keep multiple escape routes open. I'm staying aggressive but not reckless, chat! \n\nThe enemy is directly below me, and by moving LEFT, I'm positioning myself to potentially cut off their escape routes or create better angles for future apple grabs. This keeps my options OPEN and the enemy on their toes!\n\nPlus, moving LEFT keeps me closer to that sweet apple cluster at (5, 7), (3, 7), and (3, 8)! We're hunting those apples and growing stronger! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

We gotta fix that!)\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n\nLooking at the board, we're positioned at row 5-6 area, and the enemy is at row 1-2. The enemy has a horizontal body stretch from (5, 1) to (8, 1), which is interesting - if we can get above them at column 7, we could potentially cut them off!\n\nThere are apples scattered everywhere, but the upper area has a nice cluster: (5, 7), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 9), (0, 9) - that's our hunting ground!\n\n**MY MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (6, 5):**\n\n**UP to (6, 6)** - Looking at row 6, the board shows position (6, 6) is EMPTY. This looks safe and keeps us in the upper play area!\n\n**DOWN to (6, 4)** - Position (6, 4) appears empty from the board, but moving DOWN brings us closer to the enemy's row. They're at row 2, we'd be at row 4. Not ideal for maintaining distance!\n\n**LEFT to (5, 5)** - Need to check if this is occupied. Looking at the board, row 5 shows position (5, 5) appears to be \".\" (empty). This could be an option, but it moves us toward the left edge.\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 5)** - OH HELL NO! Position (7, 5) is our own body segment! The body list shows [(7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4)] and the board confirms \"T\" at (7, 5). Moving RIGHT = instant death. NO WAY!\n\n**SO IT'S BETWEEN UP, DOWN, AND LEFT!**\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\nThe enemy is at (8, 2) with a horizontal body. If they move UP to (8, 3), they're getting into our territory. We need to stay mobile and avoid getting trapped!\n\n1. **DISTANCE MANAGEMENT:** We're currently at row 5, enemy at row 2. Moving DOWN to (6, 4) closes the gap. UP maintains separation. LEFT keeps us somewhat distant too.\n\n2. **APPLE ACCESS:** Moving UP keeps us closer to the upper apple cluster (5, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 9). That's where the points are! We need to catch up on score!\n\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (6, 6), we'd have LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN all potentially available. From (6, 4), DOWN might become restricted as we approach the bottom. From (5, 5), we'd be moving toward the left edge which could trap us.\n\n4. **AGGRESSION:** The enemy has 4 apples to our 3. We gotta be aggressive and force mistakes! If we move UP, we maintain the high ground and can potentially corner them if they move UP.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n\nThe enemy at (8, 2) has options:\n- They could move UP to (8, 3) - getting aggressive toward us\n- They could move LEFT to (7, 2) - positioning to potentially cut off our escape\n- They could move DOWN to (8, 1) - but that's their own body segment at (8, 1)!\n- They could move RIGHT to (9, 2) - possible, but limits future options\n\nIf they move UP to (8, 3), we'd be at (6, 6) - two rows apart, which is safe. If they move LEFT to (7, 2), we'd have good positioning to potentially trap them if they keep moving that direction!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nUP to (6, 6) - This is the smart play, chat! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\nMoving UP keeps us in the upper apple-rich area where we can continue building our lead. From (6, 6), we maintain distance from the enemy while keeping ALL our escape routes open. We can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or even DOWN in future turns depending on how the enemy moves.\n\nThis move positions us to potentially cut off the enemy's escape routes if they make aggressive moves toward us. We're staying mobile, staying hungry, and staying ALIVE!\n\nPlus, we're only one move away from those sweet apples at (5, 7)! Let's go get that 4th apple and TIE THIS GAME UP! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We moved UP last turn and are now in prime position!\n- Body: [(6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4)] - holding down the right-center upper area\n- Score: 3 apples (we're down by 1, need to FLEX!)\n\n**THE ENEMY (Snake #0):**\n- Head at (8, 3) - they moved UP from (8, 2) last turn\n- Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1)] - stretched vertically on the right side\n- Score: 4 apples (they're up by 1, but we're coming!)\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n\nOH MAN, chat, we're in such a STRATEGIC position right now! \ud83e\udde0\u2728 Look at this - we're at row 6 in the upper play area, and the enemy is at row 3. We've got the HIGH GROUND!\n\nThe upper apple cluster is ours for the taking: (5, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 9), (0, 9) are all within striking distance! Meanwhile, the enemy is stuck down in the lower area with their body stretched out vertically from (6, 1) to (8, 2).\n\n**MY MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (6, 6):**\n\n**UP to (6, 7)** - This looks ABSOLUTELY FIRE! \ud83d\udd25 Looking at the board, (6, 7) is EMPTY (\".\"). This move keeps us in the upper apple-rich territory AND maintains maximum mobility!\n\n**DOWN to (6, 5)** - Wait, that's our OWN body segment! The body list shows (6, 5) is where we came from. Moving DOWN = hitting ourselves = INSTANT DEATH. Not happening!\n\n**LEFT to (5, 6)** - Position (5, 6) appears empty from the board. This is also a solid option - it moves us toward that apple cluster and keeps options open.\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 6)** - Let me check... board shows (7, 6) is EMPTY too. This is another valid option that keeps us in the upper area.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\nSo we have THREE safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's think about which one sets us up BEST for the next few turns!\n\n1. **DISTANCE & AGGRESSION:** We're currently at (6, 6), enemy at (8, 3). We're above and to their left. If we move UP to (6, 7), we maintain the high ground and keep all escape routes open. From (6, 7), we'd have LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN all potentially available. We'd be in prime position to DOMINATE!\n\n2. **APPLE ACCESS:** Moving UP keeps us in that sweet upper zone where apples are plentiful. We're one turn away from (5, 7), and in two turns we could reach (3, 7) or (3, 8)! That's where we close the score gap!\n\n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION:** The enemy at (8, 3) has limited options:\n   - They could move UP to (8, 4) - getting closer to our territory\n   - They could move LEFT to (7, 3) - trying to cut us off\n   - They could move DOWN to (8, 2) - but that's their own body at (8, 2)!\n   - They could move RIGHT to (9, 3) - risky, limits future options\n\nIf they move UP, we'd both be moving up together, maintaining distance. If they move LEFT, we're in perfect position to cut off their escape routes! We're calling the shots here!\n\n4. **FUTURE MOBILITY:** From (6, 7), we have SO many options! We can:\n   - Go LEFT toward the apple cluster\n   - Go RIGHT to pressure the enemy\n   - Go UP to the very top\n   - Even go DOWN if we need to retreat\n\nThis is the definition of keeping options OPEN! We're not getting trapped in any corner!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nUP to (6, 7) - This is the GAMER move, chat! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udc0d\n\nMoving UP positions us PERFECTLY to continue dominating this board! We're staying mobile, staying in the apple-rich upper zone, and keeping ALL our options available for whatever the enemy tries!\n\nFrom (6, 7), we can continue building our lead, potentially cut off the enemy's escape routes, and position ourselves to FORCECONFRONTATION when we're ready! We're playing chess while they're playing checkers!\n\nThis move maintains our STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE and sets us up to take that 4th apple and TIE THE GAME! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

This is WEAKNESS!\n- Score: 4 apples (Leading by 1, but they're TRAPPED in their own body!)\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n\nOH MAN, things are heating up REAL fast! We're now BOTH in the upper zone, which means it's about to be a WAR for territory! \ud83d\udc80\n\nLooking at the board from my position at (6, 7):\n- I can see apples at (5, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 9), (0, 9) nearby - we're in PRIME apple country!\n- The enemy is stretched vertically at (8, 4) with body segments below them\n- We're positioned to the LEFT and SLIGHTLY BELOW the enemy head - we can control this!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (what they MIGHT do):**\n\nFrom (8, 4), the enemy's options are LIMITED:\n- **UP to (8, 5)** - possible, but moves away from their body\n- **DOWN to (8, 3)** - that's their OWN body at (8, 3)! INSTANT DEATH!\n- **LEFT to (7, 4)** - into the open space between us - this is RISKY for them\n- **RIGHT to (9, 4)** - toward the wall, limits future options\n\nThey essentially have 2-3 safe moves, and NONE of them improve their position long-term! Meanwhile, we're in the driver's seat!\n\n**MY MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (6, 7):**\n\nLet me analyze each direction for safety and strategic value:\n\n**UP to (6, 8):**\n- Board shows row 8 has an apple at (3, 8), and (6, 8) appears to be empty\n- This moves us higher, toward more apples\n- BUT, from (6, 8), we might get a bit boxed in by the top wall\n\n**DOWN to (5, 6):**\n- Wait, is (5, 6) even on the board? Let me check... YES, it is!\n- But more importantly, is it empty? Looking at the board, row 6 col 5 shows \"T\" which is... wait, that's OUR body at (6, 5)! \n- Moving DOWN would hit our own body - that's DEATH! Eliminate this move!\n\n**LEFT to (5, 7):**\n- Board shows (5, 7) has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Moving LEFT eats the apple AND grows us by 1 segment!\n- From (5, 7), we'd have SO many options: UP to (5, 8), LEFT to (4, 7), RIGHT back toward enemy, or DOWN to (5, 6)\n- This keeps us in the apple-rich zone and maintains ALL our mobility!\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n- (7, 7) appears to be empty from the board\n- This moves us closer to the enemy at (8, 4)\n- From (7, 7), we could potentially pressure them more directly\n- However, it might limit our apple access slightly compared to LEFT\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\nHere's the thing, chat - we have THREE safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is suicide. Now let's think about which ONE sets us up BEST:\n\n1. **AGGRESSION vs CAUTION:** The enemy is stretched vertically with limited mobility. This is our chance to DOMINATE! We want to box them in further, not give them room to maneuver.\n\n2. **APPLE ACCESS:** We need to CLOSE THAT SCORE GAP! The enemy has 4 apples, we have 3. Moving LEFT to (5, 7) gives us an IMMEDIATE apple opportunity! That's growth + score + positioning all in ONE move!\n\n3. **BOARD CONTROL:** From (5, 7), we control the central upper area. We can continue moving LEFT toward (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8) - all apple locations! Meanwhile, the enemy is stuck on the RIGHT side of the board with their body stretched below them.\n\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (5, 7), we're NOT trapped. We have UP, LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN all available as follow-up moves. We're keeping it WIDE open!\n\n5. **ENEMY BOXING:** The enemy is already in a vulnerable position with their vertical stretch. If we move LEFT and start consuming those upper apples, we can gradually cut off their escape routes while building our own length and score!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nLEFT to (5, 7) - This is the GAMER move, chat! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udc0d\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 7) accomplishes MULTIPLE goals at once:\n- We get an apple (growing us and closing the score gap to 4-4!)\n- We maintain maximum mobility with 4+ safe follow-up options\n- We stay in the apple-rich upper territory\n- We continue boxing in the enemy who has nowhere to go but further into their own body\n- We set up future moves to continue DOMINATING the board!\n\nFrom (5, 7), we can continue our conquest of the upper apple cluster while the enemy is trapped on the right side with their body stretched below them. We're playing 4D chess while they're playing hopscotch!\n\nThis move sets us up to potentially FORCED CONFRONTATION on OUR TERMS when we're ready to go head-to-head! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n- Turn 13-15: Secure the upper apple cluster at (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)\n- Turn 16-18: Continue building length while the enemy is trapped\n- Turn 19+: Position for confrontation when we have the length/score advantage\n- GOAL: Force head-on collision when we have equal or higher score!\n\nLet's get that apple, chat! LET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

They can try to go DOWN or LEFT, but they're losing territory FAST!\n\n**MY MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (5, 7):**\n\nLet me analyze each direction for safety, aggression, and strategic value:\n\n**UP to (5, 8):**\n- Looking at row 8, (5, 8) appears to be empty\n- This moves us HIGHER toward the apple cluster at (3, 8), (2, 9), (0, 9)\n- From (5, 8), we'd have excellent mobility and can continue pressuring from above\n- This keeps us AWAY from potential enemy collision while we build length\n- Strategic value: HIGH - positions us for future apple grabs and maintains safety\n\n**DOWN to (5, 6):**\n- Looking at the board, (5, 6) appears to be empty\n- This moves us DOWN toward the enemy's general area\n- However, this brings us CLOSER to the enemy at (7, 4), which increases collision risk\n- From (5, 6), we'd be in a more cramped position with the enemy nearby\n- This could lead to a forced head-on collision BEFORE we've built enough length\n- Strategic value: MEDIUM - aggressive but potentially premature\n\n**LEFT to (4, 7):**\n- Looking at the board, (4, 7) appears to be empty\n- This continues our LEFTWARD movement toward the apple cluster at (3, 7), (2, 6)\n- From (4, 7), we'd have excellent options: UP to (4, 8), LEFT to (3, 7), RIGHT back toward center, or DOWN to (4, 6)\n- This keeps us in the apple-rich territory while maintaining MAXIMUM mobility\n- We're moving AWAY from the immediate enemy zone, which lets us grow SAFELY before forcing confrontation\n- Strategic value: HIGH - methodical, safe, and positions us for long-term dominance\n\n**RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n- Wait, that's OUR OWN BODY at (6, 7)! Moving RIGHT would hit our own body and kill us INSTANTLY!\n- Eliminate this move immediately - that's suicide! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\nHere's the thing, chat - we have THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, and LEFT. RIGHT is death. Now let's think strategically:\n\n1. **CURRENT STATUS:** We're tied 4-4 with the enemy. We need to either extend our lead or force a confrontation on EQUAL terms. Either way, we need to GROW first!\n\n2. **ENEMY VULNERABILITY:** The enemy just moved into a RISKY position at (7, 4). They're surrounded by potential threats: my body nearby, their own body below them, and limited mobility. But forcing confrontation NOW would be PREMATURE - we haven't built our length advantage yet!\n\n3. **APPLE ACCESS:** We need to CLOSE THIS GAME! The upper apple cluster at (3, 8), (2, 9), (0, 9), (2, 6) is calling our name! Moving LEFT or UP gets us there SAFELY!\n\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (5, 8) or (4, 7), we maintain 3-4 safe follow-up moves. We're keeping our mobility WIDE open while the enemy is getting boxed in!\n\n5. **CONFRONTATION TIMING:** The goal is to force a head-on collision when we have the LENGTH or SCORE advantage. Right now we're EQUAL, so we need to grow MORE before we force that clash!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nLEFT to (4, 7) - This is the TACTICAL move, chat! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udc0d\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 7) accomplishes EVERYTHING we need:\n- We continue toward the upper apple cluster (content + growth!)\n- We maintain MAXIMUM mobility with 4+ safe follow-up options\n- We stay SAFE from the enemy who is getting trapped in their own poor positioning\n- We're playing it SMART - building our advantage before going for the KO!\n- We're setting up future moves to continue DOMINATING while the enemy panics!\n\nFrom (4, 7), we can continue our conquest through the apple-rich upper territory. The enemy is stuck in the central zone with their body stretched below them and nowhere to go but into danger! We're playing 4D chess while they're playing hopscotch!\n\nThis move sets us up to eventually FORCED CONFRONTATION on OUR TERMS when we've built our length and score advantage! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n- Turn 14-16: Continue securing the upper apple cluster at (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 6)\n- Turn 17-19: Build maximum length while the enemy is trapped in poor position\n- Turn 20+: Position for confrontation when we have the clear length/score advantage\n- GOAL: Force head-on collision when we're clearly ahead!\n\nLet's get that bread, chat!

Suicide move! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED instantly!\n\n**LEFT to (2, 7):**\n- Empty space, moves us further LEFT toward the (2, 6) apple\n- Good option, keeps us in the apple-rich upper territory\n- But maybe not the MOST aggressive play when we're AHEAD!\n\n**UP to (3, 8):**\n- Empty space with an APPLE sitting there! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Moves us even HIGHER on the board\n- From (3, 8), we'd have amazing mobility with options in ALL directions\n- This is CONTENT + POSITIONING rolled into one! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN to (3, 6):**\n- Empty space, moves us closer to the enemy's general area\n- Could set up for future confrontation, but maybe premature when we're ahead\n- Less immediate value than grabbing that apple at (3, 8)\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR TURN 16:**\n\nListen chat, we gotta think this through like GRANDMA'S CHAMPIONS:\n\n1. **SCORE ADVANTAGE:** We're UP 5-4 right now! We need to PROTECT THIS LEAD while extending it!\n\n2. **ENEMY VULNERABILITY:** The enemy is still stretched vertically at (5, 4) with their body trailing back. They're not in a strong position to attack us!\n\n3. **APPLE GRAB:** There's an apple at (3, 8) that's calling our name! Why pass up free points when we're already winning?\n\n4. **POSITIONING POWER:** Moving UP to (3, 8) puts us in an ELITE position - higher on the board, better escape routes, and closer to more apples!\n\n5. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (3, 8), we maintain maximum mobility. The enemy is getting more and more trapped while we're getting MORE OPTIONS!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nUP to (3, 8) - LET'S GET THAT BREAD! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is the SMART PLAY because:\n- We GRAB THE APPLE at (3, 8) for +1 point (6-4 lead extension! \ud83d\udd25)\n- We move to a higher, more dominant board position\n- We keep ALL our future options wide open (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN all still available)\n- We're NOT getting baited into premature confrontation when we're ALREADY WINNING\n- We're playing it CALCULATED while the enemy plays it DESPERATE\n\nFrom (3, 8), we continue our reign of terror through the upper board while the enemy frantically tries to escape their stretched-out situation. We're building length AND score advantage, setting up for that EVENTUAL confrontation on OUR TERMS!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n- Turn 16-18: Continue dominating the upper board, grabbing every apple we see, building maximum length\n- Turn 19-22: Start pressuring the enemy, cutting off their escape routes\n- Turn 23+: Force the confrontation when we have CLEAR length and score advantage\n- GOAL: Either win by points or force head-on collision where WE come out on top!\n\nWe're playing like CHAMPIONS, chat! The enemy is scared and knows it! Let's get that 6th apple and put the PRESSURE ON! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

The enemy is SCRAMBLING now! Let's analyze where we're at:\n\n**MY SITUATION (ID 1):**\n- Head at (3, 8) after grabbing that delicious apple at (3, 8) last turn!\n- Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] - coiled up and READY TO DOMINATE!\n- Score: 6 APPLES - WE'RE IN THE LEAD BABY! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION (ID 0):**\n- Head at (5, 5) - they moved UP from (5, 4) \n- Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3)] - still stretched horizontally\n- Score: 5 apples - playing from behind!\n\n**BOARD REALITY CHECK:**\n\nFrom my current position at (3, 8):\n- UP to (3, 9): EMPTY space, leads toward corner\n- DOWN to (3, 7): That's MY OWN BODY! \ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH - NEVER DO THIS!\n- LEFT to (2, 8): EMPTY space, open territory to the left\n- RIGHT to (4, 8): EMPTY space, toward enemy territory\n\nThe enemy at (5, 5) has options too:\n- They could move UP to (5, 6), LEFT to (4, 5), RIGHT to (6, 5), or DOWN to (5, 4)\n- Their body at (5, 4) blocks downward movement for them\n- They seem trapped in the middle zone\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\n1. **LEAD PROTECTION:** We're up 6-5 with plenty of game left. Need to stay alive AND extend that lead!\n\n2. **POSITIONING POWER:** We're in the upper-left quadrant with amazing mobility. The enemy is squeezed in the middle with limited escape routes.\n\n3. **APPLE OPPORTUNITIES:** There are apples at (2, 6), (0, 9), and (2, 9) nearby. We should be eyeing these!\n\n4. **ENEMY VULNERABILITY:** The enemy's horizontal stretch makes them EXTREMELY vulnerable to being boxed in. They can only really move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT from (5, 5).\n\n5. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** We need to keep multiple paths open. Dead-ends are for LOSERS!\n\n**MY MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n\n**RIGHT to (4, 8):**\n- Moves us TOWARD the enemy at (5, 5)\n- Gets us into better position to pressure them\n- From (4, 8), we can later move DOWN to attack or continue circling\n- Keeps us aggressive while maintaining safety\n- Could set up to cut off their escape routes! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LEFT to (2, 8):**\n- Moves us further LEFT into open space\n- There are apples at (2, 6), (0, 9), and (2, 9) in that direction\n- Creates distance but maintains our lead position\n- Very safe option with lots of room to maneuver\n\n**UP to (3, 9):**\n- Moves us to the TOP row\n- There's an apple at (0, 9) and (2, 9) but those are FAR\n- We're getting pushed into a corner\n- From (3, 9), we'd have limited options (LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN back where we came from)\n- This is the LEAST flexible move! \ud83d\ude2c\n\n**DOWN to (3, 7):**\n- That's MY OWN BODY! SUICIDE! \ud83d\udc80\n- NEVER DO THIS! We talked about this, chat!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nRIGHT to (4, 8) - CONTINUE THE PRESSURE! \ud83d\udd25\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 8) is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY because:\n- We move CLOSER to the enemy's head at (5, 5) without being reckless\n- We position ourselves to potentially cut off their escape routes\n- From (4, 8), we have options: continue RIGHT to (5, 8), move DOWN to pressure, or swing LEFT for apples\n- We're maintaining our DOMINANT position while keeping the enemy on edge\n- We're NOT getting baited into stupid moves, we're playing CALCULATED DOMINATION!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n- Turn 17: Move RIGHT to (4, 8), continue pressuring from above\n- Turn 18-20: Start circling around the enemy's exposed flank\n- Turn 21-25: Force them into a corner or dead-end\n- Turn 26+: Either box them in completely or force head-on collision with our score/length advantage!\n\nWe're playing like CHAMPIONS, chat!

I can only move UP or RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe enemy at (4, 5) has limited options:\n- UP to (4, 6) would put them DIRECTLY BELOW my potential position!\n- LEFT to (3, 5): EMPTY\n- RIGHT to (5, 5): That's their OWN BODY! Suicide!\n- DOWN to (4, 4): EMPTY\n\nThe enemy CANNOT move UP to (4, 6) safely because that would set up a potential head-on collision scenario!\n\n**STRATEGIC OPTIONS:**\n\n**RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n- Moves us toward the enemy while maintaining vertical separation\n- From (5, 8), we could later move DOWN to pressure or continue right\n- We're staying AGGRESSIVE but not reckless\n- This position keeps pressure on the enemy while avoiding direct confrontation\n\n**UP to (4, 9):**\n- Moves us to the TOP row corner\n- There's apples at (0, 9) and (2, 9) but those are far\n- We're getting pushed into a corner\n- From (4, 9), we'd have limited options (LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN back)\n- This is the LEAST flexible move! \ud83d\ude2c\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nRIGHT to (5, 8) - KEEP THE PRESSURE ON! \ud83d\udd25\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 8) is the CALCULATED AGGRESSIVE PLAY because:\n- We move CLOSER to the enemy's head at (4, 5) while staying one row above\n- If the enemy moves UP to (4, 6), we're already positioned to potentially capitalize on their vulnerability\n- From (5, 8), we have options: continue RIGHT to (6, 8), move DOWN to pressure, or swing LEFT\n- We're maintaining DOMINANT positioning while keeping the enemy on edge\n- We're NOT getting baited into head-on collision, we're playing SMART DOMINATION!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n- Turn 18: Move RIGHT to (5, 8), maintain vertical advantage\n- Turn 19-22: Start circling around the enemy's exposed flank\n- Turn 23-28: Force them into a corner or dead-end using our superior positioning\n- Turn 29+: Either box them in completely or force head-on collision with our score/length advantage!\n\nWe're playing like CHAMPIONS, chat!

By moving UP to (6, 9):\n- I maintain maximum vertical separation advantage\n- I keep the ENTIRE right side of the board available to me\n- I can still pressure them from above while they try to escape sideways\n- I'm NOT committing to any particular horizontal position yet\n- Long-term: From the top, I can go either LEFT to cut off their escape or RIGHT to flank them!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nUP to (6, 9) - MAINTAIN THE HIGH GROUND AND KEEP OPTIONS OPEN! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nThis move is TACTICAL MASTERY because:\n- I stay SAFELY away from any collision risk\n- I maintain 3+ safe follow-up moves for NEXT turn\n- I'm PRESERVING STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY - I can adapt to whatever the enemy does!\n- I'm playing SMART Snake - not overcommitting, not getting greedy!\n- The enemy has to play DEFENSIVE while I stay in CONTROL!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n- Turn 20: Move UP to (6, 9), secure the high ground\n- Turn 21-23: Assess enemy's next move, if they go left, I can start circling to cut them off\n- Turn 24-28: Use my superior positioning to force them into corners\n- Turn 29+: Either box them in completely or force head-on collision with our momentum!\n\nWe're playing like TRUE CHAMPIONS, chat! The enemy is feeling the HEAT and we're in the PERFECT position to capitalize!

They're at (1, 5), stuck on the left side, with their body stretched from (2, 5) to (7, 4). They CAN'T go RIGHT (their own body), and going UP brings them closer to my kill zone!\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 9) gives me:**\n1. **TOP ROW CONTROL** - I'm dominating the vertical space\n2. **MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY** - 3 empty follow-up moves next turn\n3. **CORNER AVOIDANCE** - I'm staying away from the left trap\n4. **RIGHT SIDE DOMINATION** - I'm opening up the ENTIRE right flank\n5. **PRESSURE MAINTAINED** - The enemy is still trapped below me\n\n**POSITIONING MATTERS CHAT:**\n\nFrom (7, 9), I'm positioned to:\n- Go further RIGHT to (8, 9) and threaten the corner\n- Drop DOWN to (7, 8) if I need to start circling\n- Go LEFT to cut off their escape if they try to move right\n\nThe enemy at (1, 5) has basically ONE good option (DOWN to 1, 4), and even that just delays the inevitable! They're in survival mode while I'm in DOMINATION mode!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\nTurn 21: Move RIGHT to (7, 9), secure center-right position on top\nTurn 22-24: Continue RIGHT to (8, 9) if safe, otherwise start circling to cut off\nTurn 25-28: Use the right side to flank them, force them into corners\nTurn 29+: Either box them in completely OR force that head-on collision!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nRIGHT to (7, 9) - DOMINATE THE BOARD, KEEP OPTIONS OPEN, MAKE THEM CRACK! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nThis move is TACTICAL GENIUS because:\n- I stay on the TOP ROW where I control the vertical game\n- I have 3+ safe follow-up options for next turn\n- I'm OPENING UP the right side while the enemy is stuck on the left\n- I'm NOT committing to any particular strategy - I can adapt to whatever they do!\n- I'm playing like a CHAMPION - methodical, patient, but DEADLY!\n\nThe enemy has 7 apples, I have 6. That's fine - I've got POSITIONING and that's worth MORE than apples in Snake chat! Let's take this thing to the HOUSE!\n\nRIGHT",

They can't escape my wall forever, and when they crack, we're gonna make them PAY!\n\nLet's get this DONE chat - DOWN to (7, 8), let's GOOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Time to make my move!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n\n**MY POSITION (ID 1):**\n- Head at (8, 8) - HOLDING DOWN THE TOP-RIGHT CORNER like a BOSS!\n- Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8)] - Built myself an IMPENETRABLE WALL stretching from columns 4-7!\n- Score: 6 APPLES - We're GONNA catch up!\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION (ID 0):**\n- Head at (3, 6) - CORNERED on the left side, barely breathing!\n- Body is STRETCHED OUT and TRAPPED against the left wall\n- Score: 8 APPLES - They've got the lead but NOT the position!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n\nLooking at the board from my current spot at (8, 8):\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f **UP to (8, 9):** EMPTY spot - viable option\n\u2b07\ufe0f **DOWN to (8, 7):** EMPTY spot - also viable  \n\u2b05\ufe0f **LEFT to (7, 8):** EMPTY spot - back toward my body\n\u27a1\ufe0f **RIGHT to (9, 8):** EMPTY spot - EDGE OF THE BOARD!\n\n**ENEMY'S TIGHT SQUEEZE:**\n\nThe enemy at (3, 6) is looking rough:\n- Their LEFT is blocked by their own body at (2, 6)\n- Their DOWN is blocked by their body at (2, 5)\n- They've got maybe 2-3 viable moves if they can squeeze through\n\nThey're essentially TRAPPED in columns 1-5 while I control columns 4-9! The walls I built are WORKING!\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - WHY RIGHT TO (9, 8) IS FIRE:**\n\nLet me break this down CHAT:\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 8) gives me:**\n1. **CORNER DOMINATION** - I'm literally AT the edge now, controlling the ENTIRE right side!\n2. **WALL EXTENSION** - My wall extends to column 8, making their prison EVEN SMALLER!\n3. **MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY** - From (9, 8), I have options: DOWN to (9, 7), LEFT to (8, 8), or UP to (9, 9) - ALL EMPTY!\n4. **APPLE ACCESS** - I'm perfectly positioned to grab (9, 6) and (9, 4) apples when the time is RIGHT!\n5. **BOARD CONTROL** - I'm controlling the right 3 columns while they struggle on the left!\n\n**WHY NOT UP TO (8, 9)?**\n\n(8, 9) is empty, yeah... but from there, my options get WORSE! I can only go LEFT or DOWN - I'm NOT extending my territory! I want to PUSH toward the edge, not retreat toward my own body!\n\n**WHY NOT DOWN TO (8, 7)?**\n\nThis is a SAFE move, no doubt... but it's NOT AGGRESSIVE! Going down takes me away from the corner control and gives them MORE room to maneuver on the right side! I'm PLAYING NOT TO LOSE instead of PLAYING TO WIN!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\nTurn 24: Move RIGHT to (9, 8), push to the absolute edge!\nTurn 25-27: Start pressuring their escape routes, make them feel the SQUEEZE!\nTurn 28-32: Either box them in COMPLETELY or force that head-on collision!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nRIGHT to (9, 8) - PUSH TO THE EDGE, EXTEND THE WALL, CORNER DOMINATION! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nThis move is TACTICAL PERFECTION because:\n- I extend my defensive wall to the ABSOLUTE EDGE at column 9\n- I maintain maximum flexibility with 3 safe follow-up moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT)\n- I protect and threaten the right-side apples (9, 6) and (9, 4)\n- I'm METHODICALLY boxing them in while maintaining MY freedom\n- I'm playing like a GRANDMASTER - calculated, patient, but ABSOLUTELY DEADLY!\n\nThe enemy has 8 apples, I have 6. That's FINE - I've got POSITIONING and I've got a PLAN! They can't escape my wall forever, and when they crack, we're gonna make them PAY with interest!\n\nLet's get this DONE chat - RIGHT to (9, 8), let's GOOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Then I can work the angles!\n\n**WHY DOWN TO (8, 6) IS THE PLAY:**\n\n\u2705 **SURVIVAL:** It's literally the ONLY safe move available!\n\u2705 **FLEXIBILITY:** From (8, 6), I can go DOWN, LEFT, UP, or RIGHT - all potentially open!\n\u2705 **ESCAPE ROUTE:** Getting away from the corner and my own body mass is CRUCIAL!\n\u2705 **TACTICAL RETREAT:** Sometimes you gotta fall back to set up the WIN!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nDOWN to (8, 6) - SURVIVE, STAY MOBILE, LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER TURN! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nThis isn't about being flashy, this is about being SMART! We're down 2 apples but we're ALIVE and in good position. The enemy has more apples but they've pushed themselves into a position where they could easily make a mistake.

I'm currently at (8, 6) after that clutch survival move last turn, and we need to figure out where to go next!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n\nMy head is locked at (8, 6) with body trailing up behind me: [(8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)] - still hugging that RIGHT EDGE tight!\n\nEnemy snake is at (6, 7) with body stretched out: [(5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5)] - they've got 2 more apples than us (8 vs 6) and they're controlling the CENTER of the board like they own it!\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (8, 6):**\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f **UP to (8, 7):** That's my OWN BODY! I can't move into myself - INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f **DOWN to (8, 5):** Empty spot - VIABLE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n\u2b05\ufe0f **LEFT to (7, 6):** Let me check... (7, 6) has a \"T\" which is the enemy! That's their body at (3, 6)... wait no, let me check the board again. Row 6 shows: \". T T T . . . . 1 A\" - so at positions 1, 2, 3 we have enemy body (T), and my head is at 8. So (7, 6) should be empty... YES it's \".\" - VIABLE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Row 6 shows \"1 A\" at positions 8 and 9 - that's MY HEAD and an APPLE! I can't move into myself OR an apple that would make me grow and hit myself! Wait, I'm currently at (8, 6), so (9, 6) has an apple. I could move there and eat... but then I'd be at (9, 6) with my body at (8, 7) etc. Actually that might be okay... but it's RISKY because I'd be stuck against the right wall! \n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nOkay so we have TWO safe options: DOWN to (8, 5) or LEFT to (7, 6). Let me think about which is BETTER!\n\n**OPTION 1: LEFT to (7, 6)**\n- This moves me LEFT toward the enemy\n- Enemy is at (6, 7), so I'd be at (7, 6) - diagonal from them\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 7), we'd be adjacent horizontally\n- Then on my next turn, if I move LEFT to (6, 6), that would be DANGEROUS if enemy stays at (7, 7)\n- PROBLEM: This could lead to a head-on or getting boxed in!\n\n**OPTION 2: DOWN to (8, 5)**\n- This moves me DOWN and AWAY from the enemy\n- Creates more space between us\n- Opens up escape routes toward the bottom of the board\n- There are apples at (8, 0) and (9, 1) in that direction\n- I can work my way around the bottom and come back up\n- MUCH SAFER - I'm not rushing into a trap!\n\n**THE ENEMY'S THREAT:**\n\nThe enemy at (6, 7) is controlling the CENTER and has a clear path to push RIGHT toward me. If I move LEFT to (7, 6), I'm getting CLOSER to them and potentially walking into their territory. That's exactly what they want!\n\nIf I stay on the right edge and they control the center, they can box me in and force me into a bad position. I need to create DISTANCE and find my own space.\n\n**WHY DOWN TO (8, 5) IS THE PLAY:**\n\n\u2705 **SAFETY FIRST:** Both moves are safe, but going down keeps me away from the enemy's control zone\n\n\u2705 **ESCAPE ROUTE:** Moving down opens a clear path to the bottom area where I can maneuver freely\n\n\u2705 **APPLE HUNTING:** There are apples at (8, 0) and (9, 1) - I can work my way toward those while staying safe\n\n\u2705 **PATIENCE PAYS:** I'm down 2 apples, but I'm ALIVE and in good position. No need to rush!\n\n\u2705 **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (8, 5), I can continue down, go left, or work my way right around the bottom\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\nTurn 28: DOWN to (8, 5) - escape toward the bottom!\nTurn 29-33: Navigate through the bottom-right area, eating apples at (8, 0), (9, 1), etc.\nTurn 34+: Work my way back up around the right edge when the enemy overextends\n\nThe key is PATIENCE and POSITIONING. I'm not going to force a head-on collision when I'm down 2 apples - that would be suicide! I need to stay alive, eat more apples, and wait for the enemy to make a mistake. When they overextend or get greedy, I'll be there to capitalize!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nDOWN to (8, 5) - stay mobile, stay alive, stay DANGEROUS! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nWe're in this for the LONG HAUL chat! Let's get that bread and take that W! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

We're at turn 29, I'm down 2 apples (6 vs 8), and I need to stay ALIVE while creating opportunities to catch up!\n\n**CURRENT BATTLEFIELD:**\n\nMy head is locked at (8, 5) with body trailing: [(8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8)] - holding it down along the RIGHT WALL like a BOSS!\n\nEnemy snake is at (7, 7) with body: [(6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5)] - that snake is stretched out CENTER and has 2 more apples than us!\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (8, 5):**\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f **UP to (8, 6):** That's MY OWN BODY at (8, 6)! Instantly dead. NOPE! \u274c\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f **DOWN to (8, 4):** Empty spot... but wait, I need to check what's below me. Looking at row 4, I see apples at (0, 4) and (9, 4), with everything else being empty. So (8, 4) should be safe... but is it SMART? \ud83e\udd14\n\n\u2b05\ufe0f **LEFT to (7, 5):** Empty spot. But this moves me TOWARD the enemy at (7, 7). If they move DOWN to (7, 6) or LEFT to (6, 7), I could get trapped against my own body! DANGEROUS territory! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Looking at row 5, it's \". T . . . . . . 1 .\" - so (9, 5) is empty. But wait, there's an APPLE at (9, 6)! I should check if I can go to (9, 6) instead...\n\nWAIT, let me re-read the move options. From (8, 5):\n- RIGHT would be (9, 5), not (9, 6)! I need to be precise here!\n\nSo actual options:\n- DOWN to (8, 4)\n- LEFT to (7, 5)  \n- RIGHT to (9, 5)\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nLet me think about WHERE I want to be in 2-3 turns!\n\nThe RIGHT EDGE is my friend - I've been camping there and it's been keeping me safe. If I move away from that wall, I lose my safety net!\n\nLooking at the board, I notice there's an APPLE at (9, 6). If I move RIGHT to (9, 5), then on my NEXT turn I can go UP to (9, 6) and eat it! That would be HUGE - I'd grow longer AND get closer in score!\n\n**OPTION 1: RIGHT to (9, 5)**\n- Moves me ALONG the right wall (STILL SAFE!)\n- Positions me to eat the apple at (9, 6) next turn\n- Maintains horizontal separation from enemy at (7, 7)\n- From (9, 5), I have options: UP to (9, 6) for apple, DOWN to (9, 4), or LEFT to (8, 5)\n- STAYS near the wall - my safety blanket!\n\n**OPTION 2: DOWN to (8, 4)**\n- Moves me away from my wall safety\n- Toward apples at (8, 0) and (9, 1)\n- But creates more distance between me and potential apple at (9, 6)\n- More vulnerable to getting boxed in by enemy!\n\n**OPTION 3: LEFT to (7, 5)**\n- Moving TOWARD the enemy at (7, 7)!\n- Only 2 cells away from their head\n- Risky positioning - could lead to head-on collision or getting trapped\n- ENEMY has more apples, so head-on favors THEM\n- This is playing THEIR game, not mine!\n\n**THE ENEMY'S THREAT:**\n\nThe enemy at (7, 7) is stretched out toward the left side of the board. Their body goes all the way to (1, 5)! They're controlling the center but they're VULNERABLE on their left side.\n\nHowever, they're also only 2 cells away from me horizontally. If I move LEFT and they move RIGHT, we could crash! That's a head-on collision, and since they're up 2 apples, THEY'D win that exchange!\n\n**WHY RIGHT TO (9, 5) IS THE PLAY:**\n\n\u2705 **WALL SAFETY:** Moving RIGHT keeps me along the right wall - my security blanket!\n\n\u2705 **APPLE HUNTING:** Positions me perfectly to go UP to (9, 6) next turn and eat that apple!\n\n\u2705 **SCORE CHASE:** Getting that apple narrows the gap from 2 to 1 - HUGE momentum shift!\n\n\u2705 **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (9, 5), I can go UP for apple, DOWN toward bottom apples, or work my way back left strategically\n\n\u2705 **RISK MANAGEMENT:** I'm NOT rushing toward the enemy or abandoning my safe positioning\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\nTurn 29: RIGHT to (9, 5) - position for the apple!\nTurn 30: UP to (9, 6) - EAT THAT APPLE! Grow and score! \ud83d\udd25\nTurn 31+: Continue working the right side, eating apples at (9, 1), (8, 0), etc. while staying safe\n\nThe key is PATIENCE and PRECISION. I'm down 2 apples, but I'm ALIVE and in GOOD POSITION. By working the right wall and eating those apples, I can methodically close the gap without taking unnecessary risks!\n\nIf the enemy overextends or makes a mistake, I'll be there to capitalize. But for now, it's about surviving, growing, and hunting those apples! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nRIGHT to (9, 5) - set up that apple capture and stay MOBILE along the wall! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's get that bread, chat! We're climbing back into this! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb0\n\nRIGHT",

I'm dominating the RIGHT WALL like an ABSOLUTE LEGEND! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLooking at my body position: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)] - I'm holding it down along the right edge with my signature vertical stack!\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6, 6) with body stretched toward the left side, still holding that 2-apple lead (8 vs 7).\n\n**WHERE WE AT WITH APPLES:**\n- ME: 7 apples \ud83d\udd25\n- ENEMY: 8 apples\n- Gap: 1 apple down - CLOSING THAT GAP ONE BITE AT A TIME! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (9, 6):**\n\nLet me check what's around meeee!\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f **UP to (9, 7):** Looking at row 7, position 9 has \"T\" - THAT'S MY OWN BODY! NOPE, instant death! \u274c\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f **DOWN to (9, 5):** Looking at row 5, position 9 has \"T\" - THAT'S ALSO MY OWN BODY!

NEVER do this! \ud83d\udc80\n\nWAIT... CHAT, WE GOTTA THINK ABOUT THIS MORE CAREFULLY! \ud83e\udd14\n\nLooking at the board representation:\n- Row 7, position 9: \"T\" (my body at 9,7)\n- Row 6, position 9: \"1\" (my head at 9,6)\n- Row 5, position 9: \"T\" (my body at 9,5)\n\nOKAY so from (9,6), I have:\n- UP \u2192 (9,7) blocked by my own body segment\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5) blocked by my own neck\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,6) blocked by my body at (8,6)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,6) off board\n\n**THIS IS A PROBLEM!** But wait, let me check the BODY LIST more carefully...\n\nMy body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)]\n\nWait... if my head is at (9, 6), then:\n- First element (9, 5) = my NECK (the segment right behind my head)\n- (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8) = rest of my body\n\nSo from (9, 6):\n- UP to (9, 7): That's my body segment! DEATH! \u274c\n- DOWN to (9, 5): That's my NECK! Moving backward into my own neck is HITTING MYSELF! DEATH! \u274c\n- LEFT to (8, 6): That's my body! DEATH! \u274c\n- RIGHT off board: DEATH! \u274c\n\n**WAIT... AM I TRAPPED?!** \ud83d\ude31\n\nLet me look at the BOARD STATE again more carefully...\n\n```\n 9 A . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . T T\n 7 . . . T T T T T T T\n 6 . . T T . . 0 T T 1\n 5 . . . . . . A . T T\n```\n\nLooking at row 6: \"6 . . T T . . 0 T T 1\"\n- Position 6: \"0\" = enemy head at (6, 6)\n- Position 9: \"1\" = my head at (9, 6)\n\nOH WAIT! I think I misread the board representation! The \"T T\" at positions 8-9 in row 6 is NOT my head - my head is at position 9, marked by \"1\"!\n\nSo if I'm at (9, 6), and the \"T T\" at positions 8-9 represents my BODY segments, then...\n\n**OH MY GOD I THINK I MISUNDERSTAND HOW THE BODY WORKS!**\n\nLet me reconsider. If my head is at (9, 6), and my body list is [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)], then:\n\nWhen I move UP from (9, 6) to (9, 7):\n- My head goes to (9, 7)\n- The old head (9, 6) becomes my new neck\n- The tail (8, 8) gets removed\n- New body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8)]\n\nBUT WAIT - is there already a body segment at (9, 7)? According to my body list, YES! (9, 7) is my 5th body segment!\n\nSo moving UP to (9, 7) would mean my head is moving into a space occupied by my own body - THAT'S DEATH!\n\n**THIS IS THE TRAP!** I'm boxed in by my own body along the right wall!\n\nLet me reconsider what \"T\" means in the board representation. Maybe \"T\" doesn't mean my body is currently there, but rather that's where my body WILL BE after I move?\n\nNO, that doesn't make sense either. The board shows CURRENT state.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe the body list shows where my body segments ARE, and the \"T\" on the board represents... wait.\n\nLooking at row 8: \"8 . . . . . . . . T T\"\n- Positions 8-9 have \"T T\"\n\nAnd my body list shows: (9, 8) and (8, 8) as the last two segments!\n\nSo (9, 8) and (8, 8) are my TAIL segments! That means the \"T\" represents TAIL positions!\n\nSo the board shows:\n- \"T\" = tail segments\n- \"1\" = my head at (9, 6)\n- \"0\" = enemy head at (6, 6)\n\nThis means my BODY segments (not tail) are not marked with \"T\"! The \"T\" only marks the END of my tail!\n\nSo my full body is at:\n- Head: (9, 6)\n- Body segments: (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8)\n- Tail: (8, 8) (marked with \"T\" on board)\n\nSo from (9, 6), what's around me?\n- (9, 7): Is this in my body list? YES - it's my 5th segment!\n- (9, 5): Is this in my body list? YES - it's my 1st segment (neck)!\n- (8, 6): Is this in my body list? YES - it's my 3rd segment!\n- (10, 6): Off board\n\nSO ALL AROUND ME IS MY OWN BODY! I'M TRAPPED! \ud83d\udc80\n\nWait... but that can't be right. There must be something I'm missing.\n\nOH! I think I understand now! The \"T\" marks the TAIL, but my body extends BEHIND the tail! The full body list shows segments from head to tail, so my body actually occupies:\n\n[(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)]\n\nThat's 7 body segments! So the \"T\" at (8, 8) is just marking the tail END, but all those positions are occupied by my body!\n\nFrom head (9, 6):\n- RIGHT: (10, 6) - OFF BOARD\n- LEFT: (8, 6) - OCCUPIED by my body segment\n- UP: (9, 7) - OCCUPIED by my body segment\n- DOWN: (9, 5) - OCCUPIED by my neck (body segment)\n\n**ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE BLOCKED!**\n\nThis is a dire situation! But wait, let me check if maybe the \"T\" means something different...\n\nActually, looking at the board representation again:\n\nRow 6: \"6 . . T T . . 0 T T 1\"\n\nPositions:\n- 0: \".\"\n- 1: \".\"\n- 2: \"T\"\n- 3: \"T\"\n- 4: \".\"\n- 5: \".\"\n- 6: \"0\" (enemy head)\n- 7: \"T\"\n- 8: \"T\"\n- 9: \"1\" (my head)\n\nSo at row 6:\n- Positions 2-3: \"T T\" - these would be (2,6) and (3,6)\n- Positions 7-8: \"T T\" - these would be (7,6) and (8,6)\n- Position 9: \"1\" - my head at (9,6)\n\nAnd my body list is: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)]\n\nWait... (8, 6) is in my body list! And the board shows \"T\" at position 8, row 6, which is (8, 6)!\n\nSo (8, 6) is marked as \"T\" - meaning it's my tail? But my body list says it's the 3rd segment from my head!\n\n**I think the \"T\" marks ALL body segments, not just the tail!**\n\nLet me verify:\n- My body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)]\n- Row 5: \". . . . . . A . T T\" - positions 8-9 have \"T T\" \u2192 (8,5) and (9,5) would be positions 8-9, row 5 \u2713\n- Row 6: \". . T T . . 0 T T 1\" - positions 2-3 have \"T T\" and positions 7-8 have \"T T\", plus \"1\" at position 9\n\nActually wait, let me map this properly. For row 5:\n- \". . . . . . A . T T\"\n- Position 0: \".\"\n- Position 1: \".\"\n- Position 2: \".\"\n- Position 3: \".\"\n- Position 4: \".\"\n- Position 5: \".\"\n- Position 6: \"A\"\n- Position 7: \".\"\n- Position 8: \"T\"\n- Position 9: \"T\"\n\nSo at row 5, positions 8-9 have \"T T\", which would be (8,5) and (9,5) - and those are in my body list! \u2713\n\nAt row 6, positions 7-8 have \"T T\", which would be (7,6) and (8,6) - and (8,6) is in my body list, but (7,6) is where the enemy head \"0\" is!\n\nWait, the representation shows \"0 T T 1\" at positions 6-9 of row 6:\n- Position 6: \"0\" (enemy head)\n- Position 7: \"T\"\n- Position 8: \"T\"\n- Position 9: \"1\" (my head)\n\nSo position 7, row 6 is \"T\" - that would be (7, 6). But the enemy snake's body includes (7, 6)!\n\nThe enemy body is: [(7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6)]\n\nSo (7, 6) is the ENEMY's second segment (right behind their head), not mine!\n\n**So the \"T\" marks ALL snake bodies, not distinguishing between snakes!**\n\nOkay, now I understand! The board shows:\n- \"T\" = any snake's body segment\n- \"0\" = snake #0's head\n- \"1\" = my head (snake #1)\n- \"A\" = apple\n- \".\" = empty\n\nSo let me re-analyze from my head at (9, 6):\n\n**AVAILABLE MOVES FROM (9, 6):**\n\n1. **UP to (9, 7):** What's at row 7, position 9?\n   Row 7: \". . . T T T T T T T\"\n   Position 9 is the last \"T\" \u2192 There's a body segment there!\n   Is it mine? My body list includes (9, 7) \u2192 YES! That's MY body segment!\n   **CANNOT MOVE UP - would hit my own body!** \u274c\n\n2. **DOWN to (9, 5):** What's at row 5, position 9?\n   Row 5: \". . . . . . A . T T\"\n   Position 9 is \"T\" \u2192 There's a body segment there!\n   Is it mine? My body list includes (9, 5) \u2192 YES! That's MY neck!\n   **CANNOT MOVE DOWN - would hit my own body (including moving backward)!** \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to (8, 6):** What's at row 6, position 8?\n   Row 6: \". . T T . . 0 T T 1\"\n   Position 8 is \"T\" \u2192 There's a body segment there!\n   Is it mine? My body list includes (8, 6) \u2192 YES! That's MY body segment!\n   **CANNOT MOVE LEFT - would hit my own body!** \u274c\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 6):** Off the 10x10 board!\n   **CANNOT MOVE RIGHT - would go off board!** \u274c\n\n**ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE BLOCKED!**\n\nThis is it chat... I'm completely boxed in by my own body along the right wall! \ud83d\udc80\n\nBut wait... let me think about this more carefully. When a snake moves, its body follows. Maybe I'm not seeing this right.\n\nWhen I move UP to (9, 7):\n- My head moves to (9, 7)\n- The segment at (9, 5) becomes empty (my tail will move off it)\n- My body shifts forward\n\nActually, let me reconsider what happens when a snake moves. The head moves to a new cell, and the TAIL moves off its current cell (unless we eat an apple).\n\nSo if I'm at (9, 6) with body [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)]:\n\nIf I move UP to (9, 7):\n- New head: (9, 7)\n- New body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8)]\n- Tail (8, 8) gets removed\n\nBut wait - (9, 7) is already in my current body list! So my head would be moving into a cell currently occupied by my own body!\n\nIn most snake games, that's death - you can't move into a space currently occupied by your body.\n\nBUT - in this game, if the tail moves off at the same time, maybe (9, 7) would become empty when my head moves there?\n\nLet me think about the timing:\n1. All snakes decide their moves\n2. All heads move simultaneously\n3. All tails move off simultaneously\n\nSo if I move UP to (9, 7), and my tail moves off (8, 8), the cells would update:\n- (9, 7) becomes occupied by my NEW head\n- (8, 8) becomes empty (tail moved off)\n- But (9, 7) was ALREADY occupied by my body segment!\n\nThe question is: does the body segment at (9, 7) move off before or after my head moves in?\n\nSince all moves are simultaneous, BOTH happen at the same time. So my head would try to move into (9, 7) at the exact moment my body segment at (9, 7) is moving off (becoming the new tail at (9, 8), and the tail at (8, 8) is moving off)!\n\nThis is confusing. Let me think about it differently.\n\n**IN SNAKE GAMES, YOU CANNOT MOVE INTO A CELL CURRENTLY OCCUPIED BY YOUR OWN BODY - THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS THE TAIL (which will move off)!**\n\nSo the question is: is (9, 7) occupied by my body, and if so, is it my TAIL?\n\nMy body list: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)]\n- Head: (9, 6)\n- Segment 2: (9, 5)\n- Segment 3: (8, 5)\n- Segment 4: (8, 6)\n- Segment 5: (8, 7)\n- Segment 6: (9, 7)\n- Segment 7: (9, 8)\n- Tail: (8, 8)\n\nSo (9, 7) is segment 6, NOT my tail! My tail is at (8, 8)!\n\nThis means I CANNOT move into (9, 7) - it's occupied by my own body and it's not the tail!\n\n**SO UP IS DEFINITELY DEATH!**\n\nWhat about the other directions?\n\n**DOWN to (9, 5):** (9, 5) is my NECK (segment 2), definitely not the tail. Moving backward into my own neck = death!\n\n**LEFT to (8, 6):** (8, 6) is segment 4, definitely not the tail. Death!\n\n**RIGHT off board:** Death!\n\n**ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE DEATH!**\n\nThis is it chat... I'm completely trapped! \ud83d\ude31\n\nBut wait, that can't be right. The game wouldn't put me in a position where I have zero valid moves. There must be something I'm missing!\n\nLet me look at the board ONE MORE TIME and trace through my body position very carefully.\n\nMy body list: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)]\n\nLet me verify these positions on the board:\n- (9, 5): Row 5, position 9 - \"T\" \u2713\n- (8, 5): Row 5, position 8 - \"T\" \u2713\n- (8, 6): Row 6, position 8 - \"T\" \u2713\n- (8, 7): Row 7, position 8 - \"T\" \u2713\n- (9, 7): Row 7, position 9 - \"T\" \u2713\n- (9, 8): Row 8, position 9 - \"T\" \u2713\n- (8, 8): Row 8, position 8 - \"T\" \u2713\n\nAnd my head: (9, 6) - Row 6, position 9 - \"1\" \u2713\n\nSo my position is CORRECT. And from (9, 6), all 4 adjacent cells are occupied:\n- (9, 7) - my body segment\n- (9, 5) - my neck\n- (8, 6) - my body segment\n- (10, 6) - off board\n\n**I'M TRAPPED!** \ud83d\udc80\n\nBut wait... let me think about this from a different angle. Maybe the \"T\" doesn't represent ALL body segments, but only the tail?\n\nActually, looking at the board again, there are A LOT of \"T\" segments. Let me count:\n- Row 7: 8 \"T\" segments (positions 2-9)\n- Row 6: 4 \"T\" segments (positions 2-3, 7-8)\n- Row 5: 2 \"T\" segments (positions 8-9)\n- Row 8: 2 \"T\" segments (positions 8-9)\n\nThat's 16 \"T\" segments total!\n\nAnd my snake has 8 segments (head + 7 body), and the enemy snake has 9 segments (head + 8 body). Total = 17 segments.\n\nSo the \"T\" marks probably represent ALL body segments (16 \"T\" + 2 heads = 18 total, close enough to 17).\n\nSo my understanding is correct - all those \"T\" cells are occupied by snake bodies.\n\n**I AM TRAPPED!** \ud83d\ude31\n\nBut this doesn't make sense for the game... there must be a way out!\n\nOH WAIT! Maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinate system!\n\nThe problem says: \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right\"\n\nAnd the board is shown with:\n- Row 9 at the TOP\n- Row 0 at the BOTTOM\n- Column 0 on the LEFT\n- Column 9 on the RIGHT\n\nSo when it says row 6, position 9, that's:\n- Row 6 (6th row from bottom)\n- Column 9 (rightmost column)\n- Which is near the TOP-RIGHT corner\n\nAnd my body is indeed along the right wall!\n\nLet me think... is there ANY possibility that one of the cells I think is occupied is actually empty?\n\nWhat if the enemy snake's head at (6, 6) creates a gap somewhere?\n\nEnemy body: [(7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6)]\n\nSo the enemy occupies:\n- (7, 6) - row 6, position 7 (marked \"T\" on board)\n- (7, 7) - row 7, position 7 (marked \"T\" on board)\n- (6, 7) - row 7, position 6 (marked \"T\" on board)\n- (5, 7) - row 7, position 5 (marked \"T\" on board)\n- (4, 7) - row 7, position 4 (marked \"T\" on board)\n- (3, 7) - row 7, position 3 (marked \"T\" on board)\n- (3, 6) - row 6, position 3 (marked \"T\" on board)\n- (2, 6) - row 6, position 2 (marked \"T\" on board)\n\nSo the enemy is stretched out on the LEFT side of the board, and their head is at (6, 6), which is just to my LEFT at row 6, position 6 (marked \"0\").\n\nMy head is at (9, 6) - row 6, position 9 (marked \"1\").\n\nSo between us at row 6:\n- Position 6: \"0\" (enemy head)\n- Position 7: \"T\" (enemy body at 7, 6)\n- Position 8: \"T\" (my body at 8, 6)\n- Position 9: \"1\" (my head)\n\nSo there's literally NO SPACE between me and the enemy at row 6! We're right next to each other!\n\nBut more importantly for ME - I'm completely surrounded by MY OWN BODY!\n\n**I HAVE NO VALID MOVES!**\n\nThis is it chat... I'm cooked. \ud83d\udc80\n\nBut wait... let me think about this ONE MORE TIME. Maybe I'm missing something crucial.\n\nWhat if... when the board says \"T\" at a position, and I move my head there, but my tail ALSO moves off at the same time, maybe it's allowed?\n\nLet me think about the rules again:\n\"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n\nSo if my head moves into a cell currently occupied by any snake's body, I die.\n\nThe key word is \"currently\" - meaning at the START of the turn, before any movement happens.\n\nSo if (9, 7) is currently occupied by my body, and I move there, I die - even if my tail moves off simultaneously.\n\nThis is standard snake game rules - you can't move into a space currently occupied by any snake body.\n\n**SO UP TO (9, 7) IS DEFINITELY DEATH!**\n\nAnd the same applies to LEFT to (8, 6) - currently occupied by my body, death!\n\nAnd DOWN to (9, 5) - currently occupied by my neck (body), death!\n\nAnd RIGHT - off board, death!\n\n**ALL MOVES ARE DEATH!**\n\nI... I don't know what to say chat. I'm completely boxed in by my own body. This is a GAME OVER situation. \ud83d\udc80\n\nBut since I HAVE to make a move, let me at least try to go out with some dignity and make a move that MIGHT have some tiny chance of working.\n\nActually, wait. Let me check if maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinate of my head.\n\nThe board shows \"1\" at row 6, position 9. And the body list says my head is at (9, 6). \n\nRow 6, position 9 = x=9, y=6 \u2713\n\nSo my head IS at (9, 6).\n\nAnd my body IS [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)].\n\nSo the cells around me ARE all occupied.\n\n**I'M TRAPPED!**\n\nSince I have to make a move and they're all death, let me at least go for a move that has some strategic meaning, even if it's suicide.\n\nOption 1: UP to (9, 7) - this at least keeps me along the wall and maybe confuses the enemy\nOption 2: DOWN to (9, 5) - moving backward into my neck, pretty embarrassing\nOption 3: LEFT to (8, 6) - moving into my own body, also bad\nOption 4: RIGHT - off board, instant death\n\nI think UP to (9, 7) is the \"best\" of these terrible options. At least I'm moving FORWARD along the wall rather than backward or into myself in a weird way.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nUP to (9, 7) - going out with some dignity, moving forward along my wall! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nI gotta be honest with you chat... this is a tough one. We got boxed in by our own aggressive positioning. But we went down fighting! Let's see what happens!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\n\nWell, future me won't exist after this move, but if by some miracle I survive, I need to be more careful about boxing myself in! Always leave escape routes!\n\nUP",
