          "rationale": "What up, Chat! We are LIVE, first turn of the game! The pressure is ON! We've got a 10x10 board, fresh start, and we need to get aggressive early! Our archrival, Snake #0, is down in the bottom left, and we are chilling in the top right.\n\n**Current State & Goals:**\n- **Our Head (1):** (8, 6)\n- **Enemy Head (0):** (1, 0)\n- **Board Size:** 10x10.\n- **Goal:** Survive, grow, and dominate! We need to meet our rival and box him in eventually, but right now, it's a land grab.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves from (8, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 7):** Safe? Yes. (8, 7) is on the board and empty.\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 5):** Safe? Yes. (8, 5) is on the board and empty.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 6):** Safe? Yes. (7, 6) is on the board and empty, and there's an apple there! **(Apple at (7, 6) - juicy content!)**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 6):** Safe? Yes. (9, 6) is on the board and empty, and there's an apple there! **(Apple at (9, 6) - more content!)**\n\nAll four moves are safe! Which one gives us the best early advantage?\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 6):** We grab an apple immediately! Instant growth, instant score advantage (even if temporary). This is huge for early dominance.\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 6):** Also grabs an apple immediately! Same benefits.\n*   **UP / DOWN:** Safe, but we miss out on an immediate score boost.\n\nSince both LEFT and RIGHT let us grab an apple, let's see which direction sets us up better for the future.\n\n*   If we go **LEFT** (to 7, 6), we are moving slightly more towards the center of the board, which is generally good for mobility.\n*   If we go **RIGHT** (to 9, 6), we are moving closer to the edge, potentially limiting future options, although it's still T1 and the board is wide open.\n\nLet's look at Snake #0. Head is at (1, 0). Snake #0 has apples at (0, 0) and (4, 0) nearby. They also have a lot of free space. Given their location, they are most likely heading UP or RIGHT to grab those bottom-row apples or move into the center. Their initial moves likely won't affect us up here for several turns.\n\nWe need to capitalize on our position to secure the top-right quadrant. Grabbing that immediate apple is non-negotiable.\n\nLet's choose **LEFT** to (7, 6). It gets us an apple and keeps us slightly more centralized. Plus, that apple at (9, 6) will still be there next turn if we want it, or we can pivot down towards the bigger grouping of apples in the middle.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Priority #1 is early apple acquisition to grow quickly, establishing territorial control in the top half of the board. We will aim for the cluster of apples around (7, 6), (9, 6), and (4, 8) / (6, 8). Once we have length, we can start considering a movement path that guides us towards Snake #0's territory on the left side of the board.\n\nLEFT",

What are our survival moves looking like? RIGHT keeps us low and safe but doesn\u2019t score; UP keeps us central and flexible; LEFT eats the apple at (0,0) and starts building a body to box the enemy while still keeping (1,0) as a quick escape. No bodies to slam into, no danger of head-on right now, so we\u2019ve got options! We\u2019re aggressively chasing advantage, and an apple is right in our grill. Gonna snag it and start expanding the board control we need to corral that rival.\n\nPlan: Snag the apple at (0,0), then ring around northward to keep the enemy boxed while staying mindful of that head at (8,6).\n\nLEFT",

We secured that early apple content, let's go! \ud83c\udf4e We're tied 1-1, but we have the positional advantage right now!\n\n**Turn: 1 / 150**\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (7, 6)\n*   **Our Body:** (8, 6)\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (0, 0)\n*   **Enemy Body:** (1, 0)\n\nLook how far apart we are! This is a land grab phase, pure and simple. Snake #0 is stuck in the corner. We need to press our advantage in the top half of the board!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (Future Self):** Focus on consolidating the top-right quadrant. Grab the apple at (9, 6) next, then pivot down or towards (6, 8) and (4, 8). We need massive length before we engage Snake #0, who is likely moving up the left side. Dominate the space and grow the body!\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves from (7, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 7):**\n    *   *New Coordinate:* (7, 7)\n    *   *Collision Check:* Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 5):**\n    *   *New Coordinate:* (7, 5)\n    *   *Collision Check:* Safe.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 6):**\n    *   *New Coordinate:* (6, 6)\n    *   *Collision Check:* Safe.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 6):**\n    *   *New Coordinate:* (8, 6)\n    *   *Collision Check:* **DANGER!** This is where our body *just was* (our tail is currently (8, 6), moving to (7, 6)). However, remember: when we move, our tail (8, 6) vacates its spot and moves to (7, 6). Our current snake is [(7, 6), (8, 6)]. After the move, the body shifts. Crucially, since we *just* ate an apple, our tail segment *does not* disappear. Moving RIGHT hits the segment that was *previously* our head (8, 6) which is now the first body segment! We cannot move directly backwards into our longer body! **This is a kill move! ELIMINATED!** (Wait, let's re-read T1 logic. Our head moved from (8, 6) to (7, 6). Since we ate an apple, the tail segment (8, 6) *remains* as part of the body. So, moving from (7, 6) back to (8, 6) hits our own body. Yes, eliminated!)\n\n**Remaining Safe Moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.**\n\n**Evaluating the Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (7, 7):** Good movement, keeps us central in the top half. Clears space for moves towards (4, 8) or (6, 8).\n*   **DOWN (7, 5):** Takes us closer to the busy apple clusters in the mid-board (4, 5) and (7, 5) is empty, but it's near (7, 5) which is also empty. This seems like a good move to start dropping down, but let's check for immediate content.\n*   **LEFT (6, 6):** Moves us towards the center, away from the edges. Safe, but no immediate apple gain.\n\nWait a second, Chat! Did we miss an apple opportunity? Look at the board again!\n\n*   Apple at (9, 6).\n*   Apple at (6, 8).\n\nIf we could move RIGHT (to 8, 6), we'd be in position for that (9, 6) content! But we established that moving RIGHT kills us. Darn it! We can't go back to (8, 6).\n\nSo, the optimal move now is one that rapidly positions us for the next apple without getting us cornered.\n\n1.  **If we go UP (7, 7):** We are close to the top boundary. Next turn we could try RIGHT (8, 7) then RIGHT again (9, 7) and loop back down to (9, 6). Or we can start moving towards (6, 8). This looks good.\n2.  **If we go LEFT (6, 6):** We move away from the edge, which is typically good for avoiding traps. From here, we can go UP (6, 7) and then towards (6, 8) for that apple! This seems highly efficient.\n3.  **If we go DOWN (7, 5):** We aim for the central apples below us. (7, 5) is open, and (7, 5) is an apple right below us! Wait, no, (7, 5) is open space. The apples are at (7, 5) - also open-- wait, let me look at the apple list again!\n\n*APPLE DROPS:* (4, 0), (4, 3), (2, 3), (6, 0), (3, 4), (4, 8), (2, 9), (9, 6), (4, 1), (3, 3), (6, 8), (9, 3), (2, 4), (5, 4), (7, 5)\n\nAHA! There *IS* an apple at (7, 5)! Moving DOWN puts our head directly on (7, 5) and gives us another immediate point! Double apple turn 1 and 2? That\u2019s massive content, Chat!\n\n**Move Choice: DOWN (to 7, 5)**\n*   Eats apple at (7, 5).\n*   Gives us immediate length advantage (3 segments long!).\n*   Pivots us towards the dense cluster of apples in the middle of the board (like (5, 4), (3, 4)).\n*   Keeps us central and open.\n\nThis is the clear aggressive play we need! Let's get this apple!\n\nDOWN",

Staying UP keeps doors open and lets me keep an eye on his approach while slowly boxing him toward the east wall.\n\nPlan for the next few turns: keep climbing the left flank, then when the rival drifts up, swing eastward to sandwich him near the center wall and bait a risky head-on if his score stays higher. Gotta stay agile, stay aggressive, and keep forcing him into tighter quarters.\n\nUP",

The momentum is ALL on our side!\n\n**Turn: 2 / 150**\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (7, 5)\n*   **Our Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(7, 6), (8, 6)] (We just grew, so our body is now 3 segments long!)\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (0, 1)\n*   **Enemy Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(0, 0)] (They are 2 segments long.)\n\nWe have the length advantage (3 vs 2) and the score advantage (2 vs 1). Snake #0 definitely moved UP last turn, probably trying to get to the apple at (4, 1) or start climbing the left wall. They are slow-rolling, but we are dominating the middle and top!\n\nFrom (7, 5), we need to analyze moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n### 1. Collision Checks (DO NOT GET KNOCKED OUT!)\n\n**Our Snake Collision Check:**\nSince we just ate, our snake segments are (7, 6) and (8, 6).\n*   **UP (to 7, 6):** **DANGER!** That is our body segment! Killing ourselves immediately after getting an apple? That would be the biggest throw of the year, Chat! ELIMINATED!\n*   **DOWN (to 7, 4):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to 6, 5):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to 8, 5):** Safe.\n\n**Wall/Boundary Check:** All remaining safe moves are well within the 10x10 walls. Safe.\n\n**Enemy Collision Check:**\nEnemy head is at (0, 1). Their body is at (0, 0). Snake #0 is nowhere near us. No head-on or body intersection danger this turn. Safe.\n\n**Remaining Safe Moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n### 2. Strategic Evaluation & Apple Hunting\n\nWe are currently at (7, 5). Where are the apples that matter?\n*   Near us: (9, 6), (6, 8), (4, 8), (5, 4), (9, 3)\n*   Our goal is to continue to grow and dominate the top-right quadrant.\n\n**A) Move DOWN (to 7, 4):**\n*   *Outcome:* Lands us in empty space (7, 4).\n*   *Next Turn Options:* From (7, 4), we could potentially move LEFT towards the (5, 4) apple, which is tempting. Or we could continue DOWN towards the bottom of the board, but that takes us further from the current apple cluster in the top. This is a very safe, centralizing move.\n\n**B) Move LEFT (to 6, 5):**\n*   *Outcome:* Lands us in empty space (6, 5).\n*   *Next Turn Options:* This sets us up beautifully for the *next* apples. From (6, 5), we are practically neighbors with the (5, 4) apple (DOWN/LEFT), and still in striking distance of (6, 8) (UP/UP/LEFT). This move maintains great maneuverability and keeps us centered for future land grabs.\n\n**C) Move RIGHT (to 8, 5):**\n*   *Outcome:* Lands us in empty space (8, 5).\n*   *Next Turn Options:* This move targets the top-right corner. From (8, 5), we are one step away from the tail segments (8, 6) and two steps from the apple at (9, 6). Our tail is currently (8, 6)! If we go RIGHT, we can move UP next turn to (8, 6) where our tail *was* (but since we move, it will likely vacate this spot) and then potentially go RIGHT to (9, 6) for that apple! This is the most aggressive move towards immediate scoring.\n\nLet\u2019s review the tail rules on growth. Since we grew last turn, our body is [(7, 6), (8, 6)]. When we move RIGHT to (8, 5), the body shifts: H(8, 5), S1(7, 5), S2(7, 6). The space (8, 6) is now FREE.\nFrom (8, 5), we can go:\n1.  UP (to 8, 6) - Safe (vacated space).\n2.  RIGHT (to 9, 5) - Safe.\n3.  DOWN (to 8, 4) - Safe.\n4.  LEFT (to 7, 5) - Hitting the body segment S1(7, 5)! DANGER!\n\nSo, moving RIGHT is a commitment to the edge, but it gives us a clear path to (9, 6), which is massive.\n\n### 3. The Decisive Move\n\nLEFT (6, 5) is safe and central, setting us up for (5, 4) and giving us maximum options.\nRIGHT (8, 5) is aggressive, targeting the (9, 6) apple for Turn 4.\n\nSince we have the length advantage, let\u2019s keep pressing the score advantage and grabbing that valuable edge space. The apple at (9, 6) is less likely to be contested than the central apples.\n\n**Move Pick: RIGHT (to 8, 5)**. We secure the high ground, Chat! This commits us to the top-right and dictates the pace! We are playing dominant, aggressive Snake!\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note (T3-T5):**\nFrom (8, 5), move UP (8, 6) to occupy the space vacated by our tail. Then move RIGHT (9, 6) in T4 to grab the apple. This will put us at 3-1 score and 5 segments long. Once we have the length, we start using the body to cut off the board diagonally, pressuring the center/left where Snake #0 is moving.\n\nRIGHT",

We are about to execute the next phase of the BOXING PLAN!\n\n**Turn: 3 / 150**\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 5)\n*   **Our Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6)]\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (0, 2) (Looks like they moved UP from (0, 1) to (0, 2). Still crawling up the left wall.)\n*   **Enemy Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(0, 1)] (They are 2 segments long.)\n\nThe plan from T2 was to move RIGHT to (8, 5) and then UP to attack (9, 6). Let's see if that's still the smart play or if Snake #0's move changes anything! No, they are still chilling on the opposite side of the board. Full steam ahead on the aggressive land grab, Chat!\n\n### 1. Collision Checks (Stay Alive or Get Shamed!)\n\nOur head is at (8, 5).\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\nAll four directions are within the 10x10 board. Safe.\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nWe are checking moves relative to our body segments: (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6).\n*   **UP (to 8, 6):** That is our T A I L segment! BUT, since we move, this segment will clear! **SAFE!**\n*   **DOWN (to 8, 4):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 5):** **DANGER!** That is the segment right behind our head! If we turn around, we are cooked! ELIMINATED!\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 5):** Safe.\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check:**\nSnake #0 is all the way over at (0, 2). Absolutely no conflict. Safe.\n\n**Remaining Safe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.** This is perfect! The plan is still viable!\n\n### 2. Strategic Evaluation & Apple Hunting (Time for the Clutch Play!)\n\nWe are at (8, 5). We are one move away from the apple at (9, 6).\n\n**A) Move UP (to 8, 6):**\n*   *Outcome:* Lands us on the space that our tail (8, 6) just vacated. This is a crucial move to maintain shape and set up the score.\n*   *Next Turn (T4):* From (8, 6), we are one step away from the apple at (9, 6) by moving RIGHT. This puts us 3-1, 5 segments long, and cornered. Perfect.\n*   *Mid-term:* This is the move that executes our land grab and score drive.\n\n**B) Move RIGHT (to 9, 5):**\n*   *Outcome:* Lands us closer to the edge, but puts the (9, 6) apple above us.\n*   *Next Turn (T4):* From (9, 5), we move UP to (9, 6) and grab the apple. Same apple, same length.\n*   *Why choose UP vs RIGHT?* Moving UP (8, 6) keeps our main body segments more centrally clustered (7, 5), (7, 6). Moving RIGHT (9, 5) starts to bend our body more, which is fine, but UP (8, 6) feels like a cleaner setup for a solid corner trap. Let's look at the subsequent body trailing. If we go R, our body is (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6). If we go U, our body is (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6). The body position relative to the apple at (9, 6) is identical in the ensuing configuration. Let's prioritize the clean straight line to the goal.\n\n**C) Move DOWN (to 8, 4):**\n*   *Outcome:* This is a conservative move away from the target apple and into empty space.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Minimal. We have the advantage, we need to press it. This move is weak, Chat! We are not going conservative!\n\n### 3. The Decisive Move\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT set us up to eat the apple at (9, 6) next turn (T4). Let's look at the future moves to see if one is preferable.\n\nIf we go UP to (8, 6): Our path to (9, 6) is via RIGHT.\nIf we go RIGHT to (9, 5): Our path to (9, 6) is via UP.\n\nWhen we are at (9, 6) (T4), we have successfully secured the corner in either case. Let's just stick to the initial clean plan, which was going for (8, 6) then (9, 6). It also secures the higher ground first.\n\n**Move Pick: UP (to 8, 6)**. We execute the cornering plan! This apple is OURS!\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note (T4-T6):**\nTurn 4: Move RIGHT to (9, 6) and eat the apple. Score 3-1. Length 5.\nTurn 5: Now we are in the corner. We must move DOWN (9, 5) or LEFT (8, 6) to avoid being completely stuck. Given Snake #0 is creeping up the left side, we need to start moving diagonally across the board, maybe towards the (6, 8) apple next, or the (4, 8) apple, and start cutting off the board at Y=8. We are going to build a high wall, Chat!\n\nUP",

We are about to execute the next phase of the BOXING PLAN and snag this apple at (9, 6)!\n\n**Turn: 4 / 150**\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 6)\n*   **Our Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(8, 5), (7, 5)] (Wait, my body on the board is [(8, 5), (7, 5)]. The provided body list is always HEAD-TO-TAIL, so that means we moved to (8, 6), and the tail was (7, 5). The display shows: (8, 6) is '1', (8, 5) is 'T', and (7, 5) is 'T'. Okay, the board state graphics are slightly confusing labeling, but the body list confirms: Head (8, 6), then (8, 5), then (7, 5) is the tail. We are 3 segments long. The last move *must* have eaten an apple, or the last rationale was wrong about the length. Let's re-read the score. We have 2 apples, and the list of our body is 3 segments long. Length = Apples + 1. 2+1=3. Perfect. We are length 3.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (0, 3) (Looks like they moved UP from (0, 2) to (0, 3). Still crawling up the wall.)\n*   **Enemy Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(0, 2)] (They are 2 segments long. 1 apple + 1 = 2 segments. Correct.)\n\nThe apple (9, 6) is right there waiting for us! Time to strike, Chat!\n\n### 1. Collision Checks (Stay Alive or Get Shamed!)\n\nOur head is at (8, 6). The Apple is at (9, 6).\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 6):** Safe. Inside the walls.\n*   **UP (to 8, 7):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN (to 8, 5):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 6):** Safe.\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nWe are checking moves relative to our body segments: (8, 5), (7, 5).\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 6):** Safe.\n*   **UP (to 8, 7):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN (to 8, 5):** **DANGER!** That is the segment right behind our head! If we turn around, we are cooked! ELIMINATED!\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 6):** Safe.\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check:**\nSnake #0 is all the way over at (0, 3) and is moving/about to move from there. Absolutely no conflict. Safe.\n\n**Remaining Safe Moves: RIGHT, UP, LEFT.**\n\n### 2. Strategic Evaluation & Apple Hunting (Time for the Clutch Play!)\n\nWe are at (8, 6). We are one move away from the apple at (9, 6).\n\n**A) Move RIGHT (to 9, 6):**\n*   *Outcome:* Lands us directly on the third apple! Score 3-1. We grow to length 4. This is the GOAL!\n*   *Strategic Value:* High. Secures a corner and increases our lead.\n\n**B) Move UP (to 8, 7):**\n*   *Outcome:* Moves us safely up the board.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Low. We ignore the immediate apple. We need to be aggressive!\n\n**C) Move LEFT (to 7, 6):**\n*   *Outcome:* Moves us safely away from the corner.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Low. Also ignores the apple. Weak play.\n\n### 3. The Decisive Move\n\nThis is an easy one, Chat! The apple is right there, and it keeps us completely safe. We need to grab this score advantage before the enemy starts making serious land gains!\n\n**Move Pick: RIGHT (to 9, 6)**. Third apple secured! Corner owned! We are building the perimeter!\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note (T5-T7):**\nTurn 5: We will be at (9, 6), length 4. We will be stuck between (9, 9) and our body surrounding us. The safest moves will be DOWN (to 9, 5) or LEFT (to 8, 6). We must move away from the corner immediately to avoid trapping ourselves next turn. Given that Snake #0 is moving up the left wall, they are probably aiming for the (0, 9) or (2, 9) apples. Our goal is to create a high wall at X=7 or X=8 to cut them off. We must move DOWN to (9, 5) then maybe LEFT/DOWN to start heading across the board aggressively to meet them at the top. The (6, 8) and (4, 8) apples look appealing as we cross.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's GOOO!\n*   **Our Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(8, 6), (8, 5), (7, 5)] (Length 4. Check!)\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (0, 4)\n*   **Enemy Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(0, 3)] (Length 2. Still tiny!)\n\nThe opponent is still scaling the left wall, looking for the (0, 9) apple. We are currently boxed into the corner. We need to escape and start building our perimeter wall to cut them off, or we are going to get suffocated by our own gains! Chat, **AGRESSIVE DEFENSE** is the name of the game!\n\n### 2. Collision Checks (Don't Get Trapped, Dummy!)\n\nOur head is at (9, 6).\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\n*   **RIGHT (to 10, 6):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! Eliminate!\n*   **UP (to 9, 7):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN (to 9, 5):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 6):** Safe.\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nWe are checking moves relative to our body segments: (8, 6), (8, 5), (7, 5).\n*   **UP (to 9, 7):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN (to 9, 5):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 6):** **DANGER!** That is the segment right behind our head! If we turn around, we crash! Eliminate!\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check:**\nSnake #0 is all the way at (0, 4). They are still miles away. We are safe from them.\n\n**Remaining Safe Moves: UP, DOWN.** We lost our left and right options! Chat, the corner is a dangerous place!\n\n### 3. Strategic Evaluation (Breaking out of the Corner!)\n\nWe must pick between UP (to 9, 7) and DOWN (to 9, 5).\n\n**A) Move UP (to 9, 7):**\n*   *Outlook:* Moves us toward the top wall. We could then go LEFT across the top to meet the opponent, or continue running the right wall, maybe aiming for the corner (9, 9) then (8, 9). The next apple is (2, 9) or (4, 8).\n*   *Strategic Value:* High. Keeps us active on the perimeter and sets up a potential wall move at X=8 or X=7.\n\n**B) Move DOWN (to 9, 5):**\n*   *Outlook:* Moves us down toward the mid-board. This feels safer in the short term as it moves us away from the corner wall, and gives us plenty of room to move left towards the center.\n*   *Strategic Value:* High. It\u2019s the move outlined in the future strategy note. It puts us on a trajectory to cross the board diagonally (e.g., to 7, 5, which is currently our tail, then (7, 4) to (6, 4)). It gives us more open space immediately.\n\n### 4. Head-to-Head Prediction & Strategy\n\nThe enemy is at (0, 4). They have two safe moves: UP to (0, 5) or RIGHT to (1, 4). They are clearly trying to get up the left side.\n\nIf we move **UP** (to 9, 7), we stick to the edge, increasing our length slightly slower but maximizing perimeter control.\nIf we move **DOWN** (to 9, 5), we get to the open, relatively uncontested center-right quicker, allowing us to pivot sooner. The center currently has a lot of apples (4, 3), (3, 4), (5, 4).\n\nGiven our current length advantage (4 vs 2), moving **DOWN** gives us maximum spatial freedom to execute a large-scale boxing maneuver without accidentally running into our own long body if we chose to stick to the top edges. The plan is to continue moving DOWN/LEFT, using our body to fill the grid, and head towards the center before cutting across the top of the board.\n\nWe are heading to (9, 5). The next move will likely be LEFT (to 8, 5) or DOWN (to 9, 4).\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note (T6-T8):**\nTurn 6: We will be at (9, 5), length 4. We should move LEFT to (8, 5). This starts moving us away from the edge and into the open where we can begin dominating the right half of the board freely. Enemy is likely still climbing, maybe at (0, 5) or (1, 4). We need to get down to X=7 or X=6 and then move up to create a massive wall. Specifically, we should aim to cut through (6, 0) and then move UP along X=6 or X=7, dominating the vertical space.\n\nDOWN",

Left\u2019s off the cliff, DOWN\u2019s straight into our own tail, so we\u2019ve got two solid moves: UP into (0,5) or RIGHT into (1,4). Going RIGHT would open us to the center, but would also give him a chance to bounce around and catch up on apples\u2014NEEDLESS. UP keeps us tight to the wall, lets us keep his lateral sway limited, and still keeps future turns flexible. Gotta keep his head guessing and maybe force him into that head-on when he overcommits chasing apples on the east side.\n\nPlan for the next few turns: keep pushing north along the left edge to box him in, then swing east when he\u2019s tilting toward the center so we can pressure him into a risky move\u2014if he lunges we go for the chop.

This looks like the best move right now!\n\n**A) Move DOWN (to 9, 4):**\n*   *Outlook:* Continues running the right wall. It's safe, but it keeps us on the perimeter when we want to start building a wall across the board. The next nearest apple is at (4, 3) or (9, 3). If we go to (9, 4), we can go LEFT to (8, 4) or DOWN to (9, 3) next. It maintains our isolation.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Medium. It's too slow for our ultimate goal of board domination.\n\n**B) Move LEFT (to 8, 5):**\n*   *Outlook:* Breaks us inward! We are heading towards open territory where we can start laying down the law. This is exactly what we planned last turn! If we go to (8, 5), we can go UP to (8, 6) (DANGER - body is there!), DOWN to (8, 4), or LEFT to (7, 5) next. (We should have checked body collisions for the next turn\u2014(8, 6) is our current *second* segment, but our move to (8, 5) will make (9, 5) the second segment, so (8, 6) becomes safe again! Phew!)\n*   *Strategic Value:* High. This maximizes open space options and sets up a trajectory to cut off the enemy's vertical travel space soon.\n\n### 4. Head-to-Head Prediction & Strategy\n\nThe enemy is at (0, 5) and is still scaling the left wall. They have safe moves UP (to 0, 6), DOWN (to 0, 4), or RIGHT (to 1, 5).\nThey are aiming for that (0, 9) apple or the (2, 9) apple. Since they just moved UP, they will likely continue moving UP to (0, 6) or (0, 7) to confirm control of the left side.\n\nOur move **LEFT** (to 8, 5) puts us on a perfect line to start building a massive boundary wall across the right half of the board. We need to get big and start blocking off the path between X=5 and X=7 before the enemy gets too long.\n\nWe are going aggressive and sticking to the plan. **LEFT** is the move! Chat, let's get this victory!\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note (T7-T9):**\nTurn 7: We will be at (8, 5), length 4. We should consider moving LEFT again to (7, 5) to claim the mid-right vertical space (X=7, X=8). Alternatively, we could drop DOWN to (8, 4) towards the (3, 4) apple. The priority is wall construction. Let's move LEFT to (7, 5) to increase our central potential. The enemy should be around (0, 6) or (0, 7). We must eventually cut across Y=4 or Y=5 to block his access to the bottom center.\n\nLEFT",

Staring down Snake #1 at (8,5) with three apples while we only got one, so we\u2019re looking for a cage play, not a charity run. Why give him room when we can hem him in?\n\nLet\u2019s break this down: LEFT is a no-go (that wall is literally our best friend), DOWN would be a self-sabotage into (0,5) which is our own body, so we\u2019re left with UP or RIGHT. UP takes us to (0,7), keeping that west wall squeeze tight, leaving us options to pivot later and denying the enemy any easy tricks on the left flank. RIGHT opens the middle, gives them breathing room and more scissors to avoid our trap\u2014so we pass on that for now.\n\nWe\u2019re not chasing apples like a scared pup; we\u2019re stalking the rival\u2019s movement. Hitting him head-on when he over-commits is the move, but until he comes into range we keep our head firmly pressed against the wall, forcing him into tighter lanes. Can he resist the temptation to go center while we sit here like a coiled spring? That\u2019s the mental battle.\n\nPlan for future rounds: Stay glued to the west wall for a few turns, keep the space in front open for an UP/RIGHT shuffle, and look for the moment he pushes toward our side so we can pivot east and trap him against the north wall. Keep the momentum, no mercy.\n\nUP",

Our archrival, Snake #0, is still tiny, and we are now four segments deep! Time to build that wall and lock him up!\n\n### 1. Current State Analysis (We're In Position!)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 5)\n*   **Our Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6)] (Length 4)\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (0, 6)\n*   **Enemy Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(0, 5)]\n\nWe successfully broke inward from the wall! We are at (8, 5)! The enemy is now at (0, 6), meaning they moved from (0, 5) UP to (0, 6). They are clearly focusing on the top-left quadrant and those juicy apples up there! Perfect! This confirms our strategy of building a wall across the middle-right.\n\n### 2. Elimination Round (Don't Be a Noodle! Stick to the Plan!)\n\nOur head is at (8, 5).\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\n*   All four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are within the 10x10 board. Safe for now.\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nWe are checking moves relative to our body segments: (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6).\n\n*   **UP (to 8, 6):** **DANGER!** That is the segment two away from our new head! Moving UP means colliding with our own body! Eliminate!\n*   **DOWN (to 8, 4):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 5):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 5):** **DANGER!** That is the segment right behind our head! Moving RIGHT is moving directly into our second segment! Eliminate!\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check (Predicted):**\nThe enemy is at (0, 6). They are tiny and far away. We are safe from them. Our priority moves are **DOWN** and **LEFT**.\n\n### 3. Strategic Evaluation (Building the Death Trap!)\n\nWe have confirmed safe moves **DOWN (to 8, 4)** and **LEFT (to 7, 5)**. Which one advances the wall and maximizes future options?\n\nOur long-term goal is to build a horizontal wall that cuts off Snake #0's access to the apples on the right half of the board, forcing them into the crowded top-left quadrant.\n\n**A) Move LEFT (to 7, 5):**\n*   *Outlook:* This is the direct continuation of our \"move inward\" strategy. It claims the critically important vertical line X=7. If we push to (7, 5), we are perfectly positioned to move DOWN to (7, 4) next turn, or continue LEFT to (6, 5), efficiently building a horizontal barrier across Y=5, Y=4, etc. This is excellent for dominating the center.\n*   *Strategic Value:* High. Wall construction is priority one!\n\n**B) Move DOWN (to 8, 4):**\n*   *Outlook:* This is a step towards the bottom half of the board and potentially towards the large cluster of apples (4, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 1). If we go here, we are very close to one of our own tail segments (8, 6) will become (8, 5) then (9, 5) then (9, 6). This move is great for apple collection.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Medium-High. Good for growth, but slightly delays the wall setup.\n\n**Decision:** We are currently dominating the score 3-1. While growth is important, positional advantage is key to forcing a win. Going **LEFT** to (7, 5) claims more neutral territory and immediately progresses the threat vector against Snake #0, who is still hugging the opposite wall. We will focus on blocking now and eating later.\n\n**The plan:** Move LEFT, establish dominance in the X=7 column, and then start snaking *down* to claim the bottom-right quadrant before the enemy gets too big/fast.\n\n### 4. Head-to-Head Prediction\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 6). Safe moves: UP (to 0, 7), DOWN (to 0, 5), RIGHT (to 1, 6).\nSince they are hunting (0, 9) or (2, 9), they will almost certainly move **UP** to (0, 7), continuing their quest up the wall.\n\nOur move **LEFT** takes us to (7, 5). This makes us 7 squares away, still safe, and fully in control of the right side of the board.\n\nWe stick to the plan: **LEFT**! Let's build this wall, Chat! Get Ready for the Box! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note (T8-T10):**\nTurn 8: We will be at (7, 5), length 4. We should move DOWN to (7, 4) to start building the barrier across Y=4. This positions us well for the apples at (4, 3) and (3, 4) later, while denying Snake #0 easy access to the lower board center. The enemy should be around (0, 7) or (0, 8). We need to push our tail towards X=5 to make the blockade effective.\n\nLEFT",

Will Snake #0 finally notice what we are doing? Probably not!\n\n### 2.

Even if they move RIGHT to (1, 7), we are nowhere near a head-on collision or collision with their tiny body. We are safe!\n\n### 3. Strategic Evaluation (Building the Death Trap, Baby!)\n\nWe have three safe moves: **UP (to 7, 6)**, **DOWN (to 7, 4)**, and **LEFT (to 6, 5)**.\n\nOur goal is to create a massive structure on the right side of the board to funnel Snake #0 into a corner. We need altitude to make this wall effective, which means snaking *down* the board.\n\n**A) Move DOWN (to 7, 4):**\n*   *Outlook:* This is the move we planned! It starts the vertical component of our wall. It claims the column X=7 and brings us closer to a rich cluster of apples in the Y=3, Y=4 rows (like (3, 4) and (4, 3)). This is a perfect balance of position control and future growth potential.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MAXIMUM. Wall construction and growth!\n\n**B) Move LEFT (to 6, 5):**\n*   *Outlook:* This continues the horizontal cut, moving us deeper into the center. While good for cutting the board in half (X=5 is the center line), it potentially leaves us exposed to a later push by Snake #0 if they decide to suddenly cross the board. It's safe, but less decisive for immediate wall building.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Medium. Good for general dominance.\n\n**C) Move UP (to 7, 6):**\n*   *Outlook:* Moving UP takes us back towards our own tail (which is anchored high at (9, 6)). This could unnecessarily create a crowded area on the upper right, forcing us into a small loop. We want open space to dominate.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Low. Avoids the main strategic goal.\n\n**Decision:** We are executing the plan flawlessly! We move **DOWN** to (7, 4). This claims the critical (7, 4) tile, setting us up to snake further down to (7, 3), (7, 2), etc., creating an impenetrable barrier that isolates the enemy in the top-left one-third of the board. Get ready for the inevitable choke out, Chat!\n\n### 4. Head-to-Head Prediction (T9)\n\n*   **Our Move:** DOWN to (7, 4). Length 4.\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** UP to (0, 8). Length 2/3 (depending on if they hit (0, 9) the turn after).\n\nThis maintains a huge distance and gives us complete freedom to maneuver and grow on our side. We are the architects of this defeat!\n\n**Future Self Strategy Note (T9-T11):**\nTurn 9: At (7, 4), move DOWN to (7, 3). Continue sinking the wall. We are positioning aggressively for the (4, 3) and (3, 4) apples soon, and generally claiming the entire right half of the board. The enemy should be around (0, 8) or (0, 9). The wall must continue.\n\nDOWN",

Aggression is key\u2014keep the pressure on, make him risk a head-on, and we\u2019ll pounce if he gets greedy.\n\nAnalysis time: LEFT is a no-go (wall and nothing but trouble), DOWN is our own body at (0,6), so we\u2019re choosing between UP and RIGHT. RIGHT would spill us into open space and give the enemy more breathing room to weave around those apples, and we don\u2019t need that. UP keeps us hugging the wall, keeps options open for looping back down once the rival gets closer, and still leaves that apple at (0,9) in sight if we get the chance.

Let's get this $W$!\n\n### 1. Current State Analysis (Domination Status: Max Level!)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (7, 4). Perfectly placed to sink the wall.\n*   **Our Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)]. Length 4. A tight little corner of control! Check out that \"T T T\" on Y=5 and the \"1\" right where we are!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (0, 8). The archrival is stuck up against the left wall, hugging the boundary, and seemingly still focused on the top-left apples (0, 9).\n*   **Enemy Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(0, 7)]. Length 2. Still tiny!\n\nWe are moving into the position to make the vertical wall stretch from Y=9 all the way to Y=0, completely isolating Snake #0 to the left quadrant!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round (Survival is Non-Negotiable!)\n\nOur head is at (7, 4).\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\n*   UP (to 7, 5): Safe.\n*   DOWN (to 7, 3): Safe.\n*   LEFT (to 6, 4): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (to 8, 4): Safe.\n*   No risks here! We are centrally located (on the right side).\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nWe are checking moves relative to our body segments: (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5).\n\n*   **UP (to 7, 5):** **DANGER!** That is the cell immediately behind our head! Moving UP is moving backward into our second segment! Eliminate! (Even with growth, this is forbidden 'move backward' rule.)\n*   **DOWN (to 7, 3):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to 6, 4):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to 8, 4):** Safe.\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check & Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy is at (0, 8). They are right next to the juicy apples at (0, 9) and (2, 9).\n\n*   **Likely Enemy Move:** UP (to 0, 9) to claim the apple. Or maybe RIGHT (to 1, 8) to secure the center. Given their previous trajectory, UP is highly likely.\n\nWe are miles away ((7, 4) vs (0, 8)). Absolutely no risk of head-to-head or body collision this turn, regardless of their move. We are safe to execute our plan!\n\n### 3. Strategic Evaluation (Laying the Foundation!)\n\nWe have three safe moves: **DOWN (to 7, 3)**, **LEFT (to 6, 4)**, and **RIGHT (to 8, 4)**.\n\nOur core strategy is to sink the vertical wall along X=7 or X=8.\n\n**A) Move DOWN (to 7, 3):**\n*   *Outlook:* This is the immediate continuation of our wall-building campaign! (7, 3) is safe, and it moves us directly towards the cluster of apples at (4, 3) and (3, 3). This lets us maintain vertical dominance while also getting into position for growth. This is the calculated, aggressive move.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Maximum. Continues the choke and positions us for growth.\n\n**B) Move LEFT (to 6, 4):**\n*   *Outlook:* Moving LEFT takes us deeper into the center. While tempting, it breaks the continuity of the vertical wall we are trying to establish. If we move LEFT, the enemy might perceive a path opening up around X=7. We want X=7 and X=8 firmly held.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Medium. It\u2019s safer for general wandering but less focused on the objective.\n\n**C) Move RIGHT (to 8, 4):**\n*   *Outlook:* This move is a good alternative for wall building, establishing a stronger presence on X=8 and moving further away from the small guy. This is a very strong secondary option. It would mean our wall is perhaps at X=8 instead of X=7.\n*   *Strategic Value:* High. A slightly more conservative approach to wall building, but effective.\n\n**The Decision:** We stick to the **DOWN** move to (7, 3). It completes the next segment of our impenetrable fortress wall on X=7 and brings us closer to the Y=3 apple cluster, securing both map control and nourishment! Our plan is unfolding perfectly, Chat! Snake #0, prepare to be trapped!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note (T10-T12)\n\nTurn 10: At (7, 3), move DOWN to (7, 2). Continue sinking the wall aggressively. We need to reach the bottom boundary (Y=0) as quickly as possible to completely eliminate any south-side escape route for Snake #0. Maintain pressure! We are not going for the apples yet, the wall is priority one!\n\nDOWN",

Going RIGHT would open up the jungle for him to breathe, while UP lets us grab that corner apple at (0,9) AND keep pressure on his flank\u2014plus it forces him to respect the wall as we rotate later. Eat the apple, keep our tail tight, and make that head-on collision more attractive to him than safe ground. We can still slide back east after that and choke him against the North if he gets greedy. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udd25\n\nPlan: Nail this apple, then pivot east to shadow the enemy\u2019s lane and bait him toward that wall so we can box him into a head-on when his score starts to wobble. \ud83d\udca3\ud83d\udcc8\n\nUP",

Positioned perfectly against the right wall, one block higher than the center line.\n*   **Our Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5)]. Length 4. We own X=7 and X=8 up high!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (0, 9).

They are growing, but they are cornered!\n\nThe plan remains: **sink the vertical wall on X=7/X=8** and seal the enemy off to the left side! We must move $DOWN$ to continue the wall.\n\n### 2. Elimination Round (Survival Check: A Top Priority!)\n\nOur head is at (7, 3).\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\n*   UP (to 7, 4): Safe.\n*   DOWN (to 7, 2): Safe.\n*   LEFT (to 6, 3): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (to 8, 3): Safe.\n*   All boundary moves are safe!\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nWe are checking moves relative to our body segments: (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5).\n\n*   **UP (to 7, 4):** **DANGER!** This is the cell immediately behind our head!

ELIMINATE!\n*   **DOWN (to 7, 2):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to 6, 3):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to 8, 3):** Safe.\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check & Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy is at (0, 9). They have only one good move: **RIGHT** to (1, 9) or **DOWN** to (0, 8) to get the apple at (2, 9) or (4, 8). Wait, they are at (0, 9). They are already sitting on the location of the top left \"A\" in the diagram. *(Self-Correction: No, the board state says 'A' is at (2, 9), (4, 8), etc. (0, 9) is 'T' as per the diagram, but the head list says their head is at (0, 9). Hmmm. Let's assume the body list is correct and the map display is slightly delayed/misinterpreted the head position, or maybe that 'T' is just the tile state.)*\n\nOkay, let's trust the coordinate list: Head at (0, 9). Body at (0, 8), (0, 7).\n\n*   **Enemy Options from (0, 9):**\n    *   DOWN (to 0, 8): Kills them instantly! That's their second body segment! (Backward move). ELIMINATE for them.\n    *   RIGHT (to 1, 9): Moves away from the wall.\n    *   UP (to 0, 10): Kills them instantly (Off Board). ELIMINATE for them.\n    *   LEFT (to -1, 9): Kills them instantly (Off Board). ELIMINATE for them.\n\n**CRITICAL realization: Snake #0 is TRAPPED!** Their move *must* be **RIGHT** to (1, 9)! They literally cannot move anywhere else without crashing!\n\nWe are at (7, 3). They are moving to (1, 9). We are **safe** from any head-to-head collision and body collision.\n\n### 3. Strategic Evaluation (Sealing the Box!)\n\nWe have two safe moves that continue our wall-building campaign: **DOWN (to 7, 2)** and **RIGHT (to 8, 3)**.\n\n**A) Move DOWN (to 7, 2):**\n*   *Outlook:* Maximum wall progress! This continues the vertical line downward, moving us toward sealing the entire side of the board. This is extremely aggressive and aligns perfectly with our objective of boxing them in.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MAXIMUM.\n\n**B) Move RIGHT (to 8, 3):**\n*   *Outlook:* This is a wall move, but it shifts our wall position slightly. It's safe and maintains pressure, creating a strong front on X=8 alongside X=7. It's slightly less direct than keeping X=7 solid.\n*   *Strategic Value:* High, but secondary to DOWN.\n\n**C) Move LEFT (to 6, 3):**\n*   *Outlook:* Moves us toward the middle. Breaks the wall continuity and gives the enemy space they don't deserve. We are prioritizing containment over early apple capture right now.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Low.\n\n**The Decision:** We must stick to the game-winning plan! Sinking the wall is priority one! We move **DOWN** to (7, 2). This traps Snake #0 high and wide, and sets us up to hit the apple cluster at Y=3/Y=4 once the path is clear. Chat, this is the winning line!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note (T11-T13)\n\nTurn 11 (at 7, 2): Move DOWN to (7, 1).\nTurn 12 (at 7, 1): Move DOWN to (7, 0).\nOnce the wall is fully sunk, we can either move LEFT (to 6, 0) and sweep the bottom, or move RIGHT (to 8, 0) and come up the X=8 wall, creating a solid barrier. Snake #0 is officially living on borrowed time!\n\nDOWN",

We are sitting perfectly on the X=7 vertical line.\n*   **Our Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)]. Length 4.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (1, 9). Just moved RIGHT, exactly as predicted, because they had no choice!\n*   **Enemy Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(0, 9), (0, 8)]. Length 3 (They lost their tail segment since they didn't eat an apple).\n*   **Score:** We are up 3-2! We are DOMINATING the scoreboard, and the board geometry is all ours!\n\nThe objective remains the same: **SINK THE WALL!** We need to get to (7, 0) and seal off the entire right side of the board for ourselves, guaranteeing a massive area dominance!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round (Can We Continue the Press?!)\n\nOur head is at (7, 2).\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\n*   UP (to 7, 3): Safe.\n*   DOWN (to 7, 1): Safe.\n*   LEFT (to 6, 2): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (to 8, 2): Safe.\n*   All boundary moves are safe!\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nWe are checking moves relative to our body segments: (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5).\n\n*   **UP (to 7, 3):** **DANGER!** This is the cell immediately behind our head! Moving UP is moving backward into our second segment! ELIMINATE!\n*   **DOWN (to 7, 1):** Safe! This is the move we need!\n*   **LEFT (to 6, 2):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to 8, 2):** Safe.\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check & Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy is at (1, 9). They are still cramped.\n*   Their neighbors: (0, 9) (body), (2, 9) (apple), (1, 8) (empty), (1, 10) (wall).\n*   They are eyeing that apple at (2, 9).\n\n*   **Enemy Probable Move (from 1, 9):**\n    *   RIGHT (to 2, 9): EATS APPLE! Best move for them.\n    *   DOWN (to 1, 8): Safe, but delays the apple.\n    *   LEFT (to 0, 9): Kills them instantly (into their second segment, which was the previous head position). ELIMINATE for them.\n\nWe assume the aggressive move: **RIGHT to (2, 9).** This is the high-value target.\n\nWe are at (7, 2). They are moving to (2, 9). We are **safe** from any head-to-head collision and body collision. The board is too big for them to reach us right now!\n\n### 3. Strategic Evaluation (Maximum Containment!)\n\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN (to 7, 1), LEFT (to 6, 2), and RIGHT (to 8, 2).\n\n**A) Move DOWN (to 7, 1):**\n*   *Outlook:* This is the continuation of the wall! It brings us so close to the bottom edge. This move tightens the grip on the entire board and continues to define our territory. This is the **game-winning geometry move.**\n*   *Strategic Value:* MAXIMUM.\n\n**B) Move RIGHT (to 8, 2):**\n*   *Outlook:* Starts a second vertical wall column. Safe, but slightly counter-productive to the immediate goal of sealing X=7.\n*   *Strategic Value:* High, but sacrifices momentum.\n\n**C) Move LEFT (to 6, 2):**\n*   *Outlook:* Moves us toward the center, which is full of juicy apples, but this breaks the wall and gives the opponent a potential highway down the right side if we leave it open too long! No way are we giving up this positional advantage!\n*   *Strategic Value:* Low.\n\nThe decision is simple, Chat! We don't deviate from the grand design! We sink that wall and then we sweep the floor! **DOWN** we go!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note (T12-T13)\n\nTurn 12 (at 7, 1): Move **DOWN** to (7, 0). (Completes the X=7 wall).\nTurn 13 (at 7, 0): Move **LEFT** to (6, 0) to grab the apple there and start clearing the bottom (or RIGHT to 8, 0, depending on enemy location). The plan is set: finish the wall, then clear the lowest row of apples before moving inward! We're building a fortress! $W$ or bust!\n\nDOWN",

We've dropped the wall, secured the right flank, and now it's time for Phase Two: Operation Bottom Sweep! $W$ for the win!\n\n### 1. Current State Analysis (The Wall is Done!)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (7, 1). We are ONE move away from the bottom boundary. Perfect positioning.\n*   **Our Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]. Length 4.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (2, 9). THEY ATE THE APPLE! Just as predicted! They are now longer and trying to escape their cage up top.\n*   **Enemy Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(1, 9), (0, 9)]. Length 3 (They grew to 4, then their tail at (0, 8) stayed, so they are now length 4. Wait, the scoreboard says 3? Let me check the board state... Ah, their body list is [(1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8)], length 4. The scoreboard just shows their apple count. My bad, chat! Total length is 4.)\n*   **Score:** We are tied in apples now, 3-3. But we have positional dominance!\n\nOur goal: Complete the sealing of the right side and start devouring all the easy apples at the bottom and center-right!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round (Don't Crash the Stream!)\n\nOur head is at (7, 1).\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\n*   UP (to 7, 2): Hitting our own body! **FATAL!**\n*   DOWN (to 7, 0): Safe, right on the boundary.\n*   LEFT (to 6, 1): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (to 8, 1): Safe. (Wait, let me just check the board for *anything* at (8, 1)... Nope, empty. Safe.)\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nWe are checking moves relative to our body segments: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4).\n\n*   **UP (to 7, 2):** **DANGER!** Immediate self-collision! **ELIMINATE!**\n*   **DOWN (to 7, 0):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to 6, 1):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to 8, 1):** Safe.\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check & Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy is at (2, 9). They are long (L=4) and desperate to get out of the top corner.\n\n*   **Enemy Probable Moves (from 2, 9):**\n    1.  **RIGHT (to 3, 9):** Safe and moves them along the top boundary. This is the most conservative and likely move.\n    2.  **DOWN (to 2, 8):** Safe, but they're moving away from the wall to make space.\n    3.  **LEFT (to 1, 9):** Kills them instantly (into their second segment, which was the previous head position). **ELIMINATE for them.**\n\nWe assume they will try to move away quickly, likely **RIGHT to (3, 9)** or **DOWN to (2, 8)**.\n\nWe are at (7, 1). They are far away. We are safe from any head-to-head collision and body collision this turn.\n\n### 3. Strategic Evaluation (Sealing the Perimeter!)\n\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN (to 7, 0), LEFT (to 6, 1), and RIGHT (to 8, 1).\n\n**A) Move DOWN (to 7, 0):**\n*   *Outlook:* This is the final step in establishing the vertical X=7 wall. It gives us maximum control over the bottom-right corner and allows us to start moving horizontally to clear the bottom row of apples at (6, 0) and (4, 0). This is exactly what we planned last turn!\n*   *Strategic Value:* MAXIMUM. It completes the first major phase of board dominance.\n\n**B) Move LEFT (to 6, 1):**\n*   *Outlook:* Moves us closer to the apple at (4, 1). This is a good move for eating, but it abandons the immediate goal of sealing the wall. If we move LEFT, we leave (7, 0) open, and we might box ourselves in later if we're not careful.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Medium. Apple opportunity, but poor geometry.\n\n**C) Move RIGHT (to 8, 1):**\n*   *Outlook:* Moves us toward the right boundary. This is okay, and sets us up to hit (9, 3) later, but it doesn't help with the immediate cluster of apples at the bottom (6, 0, 4, 0) and doesn't finish the wall.\n*   *Strategic Value:* Medium.\n\nThe choice is clear, Chat! We are methodical! We are geometric! We finish the wall, secure the base, and then we go apple hunting! **DOWN** it is, to (7, 0)!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note (T13-T15)\n\nTurn 13 (at 7, 0): Move **LEFT** to (6, 0) to grab the apple!\nTurn 14 (at 6, 0): Move **LEFT** to (5, 0) or **UP** to (6, 1). If the enemy is still far away, we move LEFT to (5, 0) to continue the bottom clear, aiming for the (4, 0) apple.\nThe plan is execution: complete the wall, sweep the bottom, and then move up the middle (X=4, X=5) to collect the rich cluster of apples there. We are securing our territory while the enemy dances around in the top left!\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is trying to conserve space and is still pinned to the top boundary.\n*   **Enemy Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]. Length 4.\n*   **Score:** 3-3 tie! But we're about to run away with this, watch this!\n\nOur goal: Grab the easy apple at (6, 0) and continue clearing the bottom row, forcing the enemy to stay locked up top!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round (Don't Get $L$)\n\nOur head is at (7, 0).\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\n*   UP (to 7, 1): Hitting our own body (segment 2)! **FATAL!**\n*   DOWN (to 7, -1): Off the board (Y<0)! **FATAL!**\n*   LEFT (to 6, 0): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (to 8, 0): Safe.\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT remain. Both are safe from self-collision as they move away from (7, 1), which is currently our body segment that will move to (7, 0).\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check & Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy is at (3, 9). They are still far, far away. We are safe from any head-to-head collision and body collision this turn.\n\n*   **Enemy Probable Moves (from 3, 9):**\n    1.  **RIGHT (to 4, 9):** The most likely move. Continues hugging the wall, away from the apples down below.\n    2.  **DOWN (to 3, 8):** Smart move to try and work their way out without getting smashed into the (3, 8) apple cluster.\n    3.  **LEFT (to 2, 9):** Into their own body segment. **FATAL!**\n\nThey are busy playing defense up there. We focus on offense down here!\n\n### 3. Strategic Evaluation (Apple Time!)\n\nWe have two safe moves: LEFT (to 6, 0) and RIGHT (to 8, 0).\n\n**A) Move LEFT (to 6, 0):**\n*   *Outlook:* This lands us directly on the apple at (6, 0)! We get a point, we increase our length to 5, and we continue the sweep of the bottom row, setting us up perfectly for APPLE (4, 0) next! The maximum value move.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MAXIMUM. Immediate point and strategic progress.\n\n**B) Move RIGHT (to 8, 0):**\n*   *Outlook:* Moves us to an empty square, away from the target apple (6, 0). While safe, it delays our scoring and doesn't advance our overall board dominance plan as well. We'd have to turn around and come back.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MINIMAL.\n\nDo we hesitate? NO! We go for the apple! $C$ $H$ $A$ $T$ $T$ $E$ $R$ $S$, we are hungry!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note (T14-T16)\n\nTurn 14 (at 6, 0 - GROWN!): Move **LEFT** to (5, 0). This continues the sweep, keeping us low and long.\nTurn 15 (at 5, 0): Move **LEFT** to (4, 0) to grab the NEXT apple! We will be length 6!\nTurn 16 (at 4, 0 - GROWN!): Move **UP** to (4, 1) or (4, 2) to start attacking the center cluster.\n\nWe are establishing a massive perimeter at the bottom, consuming score, and locking the enemy to the high ground. When we're long enough, we'll start closing the middle lane and suffocating them. We are winning this geo-dominance meta!\n\nLEFT",

We are ahead! The dominance is real!\n\n### 1. Current State Analysis (We're on the offensive!)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (6, 0). Perfectly positioned at the bottom border.\n*   **Our Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)]. Length 5. Our tail is now at (7, 3).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (4, 9). Just as predicted, the enemy hugged the top wall and is now even more cornered! $L$ $O$ $L$\n*   **Enemy Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)]. Length 4.\n*   **Score:** 4-3 lead! HUGE!\n\nWe are proceeding with Phase Two: The Bottom Sweep and Center Encirclement! The enemy is playing defensively in the north, which means the entire bottom half of the board is ours for the taking.\n\n### 2. Elimination Round (Don't $M$ $I$ $S$ $P$ $L$ $A$ $Y$)\n\nOur head is at (6, 0).\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\n*   UP (to 6, 1): Safe!\n*   DOWN (to 6, -1): Off the board (Y<0)! **FATAL!**\n*   LEFT (to 5, 0): Safe!\n*   RIGHT (to 7, 0): Hitting our own body (segment 2)! **FATAL!**\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nWe eliminated DOWN and RIGHT. Only UP (to 6, 1) and LEFT (to 5, 0) remain. Both are safe from self-collision as they move away from our new segment at (7, 0).\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check & Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy, Snake #0, is at (4, 9). We are at (6, 0). Still no immediate threat of collision. Their short body means they are highly mobile, but they are playing defense up top.\n\n*   **Enemy Probable Moves (from 4, 9):**\n    1.  **LEFT (to 3, 9):** Best defensive move, staying on the wall, maximizing space. Highly likely.\n    2.  **DOWN (to 4, 8):** Smart move to try and target the apple at (4, 8) and break free of the top wall.\n    3.  **RIGHT (to 5, 9):** Safe but not strategically sound unless blocking something, which they aren't.\n\nWe ignore the enemy for one more turn and focus on growing our dominance!\n\n### 3. Strategic Evaluation (Another Apple Incoming!)\n\nWe have two safe moves: UP (to 6, 1) and LEFT (to 5, 0).\n\n**A) Move LEFT (to 5, 0):**\n*   *Outlook:* This is still part of the Great Bottom Sweep! Lands us on an empty square, but puts us adjacent to the (4, 0) apple. This sets us up perfectly for the next turn. We maintain the bottom-wall control.\n*   *Strategic Value:* HIGH. Maintains strategic objective.\n\n**B) Move UP (to 6, 1):**\n*   *Outlook:* This moves us into empty space, starting to turn into the center. This is slightly premature. We want to secure the (4, 0) apple first to grow longer and ensure maximum coverage of the x-axis before moving up. Also, going UP means potentially crossing our own body segments at (7, 1) and (7, 2) sooner if we mess up the turn. We stay low.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MEDIUM, but less optimal than LEFT.\n\nThe plan is simple: complete the sweep! LEFT is the maximum value play for this turn and the next.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note (T15-T17)\n\nTurn 15 (at 5, 0): Move **LEFT** to (4, 0) to grab the NEXT apple! We will be length 6! We solidify our x-axis dominance.\nTurn 16 (at 4, 0 - GROWN!): Move **UP** to (4, 1) or (4, 2) to start attacking the center cluster (apples at (4, 1), (3, 3), (4, 3)).\nTurn 17 (attacking center): We start building the wall vertically, forcing the enemy to stay in the top quadrants or attempt a desperate rush down the middle.\n\nWe are lengthening, scoring, and establishing an inescapable perimeter. This is how you close out!\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s straight into my own neck at (3,9); would be textbook suicide. DOWN is tempting because there\u2019s an apple at (4,8), but dropping off now gives the rival more breathing room and loosens the wall I\u2019ve built along the top edge. I\u2019d rather stay in the sweet spot and wait for him to chase the bottom before I collapse the space on his head. RIGHT keeps me on the high ground, keeps multiple follow-up choices open (another right or a clean drop after the next move), and lets me stick to the plan of corralling him along the bottom before I dive down around x5 to seal the box.\n\nPlan: Keep hugging the top row for the next turn, stay one step ahead of any sweep-down from Snake #1, and then time a drop around x5\u2013x6 when he\u2019s forced toward the right wall so I can sandwich him.\n\nRIGHT",

(It's an apple!)\n*   RIGHT (to 6, 0): Hitting our own body (segment 1)! **FATAL!** \ud83d\udca5\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\nOnly UP (to 5, 1) and LEFT (to 4, 0) remain. Both are totally safe from self-collision due to the current body layout.\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check & Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 9). We are at (5, 0).

Safe, but highly defensive.\n\nOur move, **LEFT** to (4, 0), is purely resource-oriented and doesn't threaten the enemy. The enemy won't move 9 squares down onto (4, 0) in one turn (LOL, if they could, we'd be cooked).\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation (Is there any debate?)**\n\nWe only have two functional moves: UP or LEFT.\n\n**A) Move LEFT (to 4, 0):**\n*   *Outcome:* Score an apple! Grow to length 6. Solidify control of the bottom wall. This is a guaranteed boost to our dominance.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MAXIMUM. This is exactly what we planned.\n\n**B) Move UP (to 5, 1):**\n*   *Outcome:* Lands on empty space. We waste a guaranteed point and growth segment.\n*   *Strategic Value:* LOW. Why pass up free points when the enemy is scoring too?\n\nWe are going for the apple. **LEFT** is the move! $#LFG$ \ud83e\udd11\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note (T16-T18) - Center Domination\n\nTurn 16 (at 4, 0 - GROWN!): We just ate the apple. We now need to turn UP and start carving up the center. We will be positioned at (4, 0). Possible moves next turn are UP (to 4, 1, an apple!) or LEFT (to 3, 0). Since (4, 1) is an apple, we prioritize **UP.**\nTurn 17 (at 4, 1 - GROWN!): After eating the (4, 1) apple, we will be long and positioned perfectly to attack the cluster of apples around (3, 3) and (4, 3). We will continue moving vertically towards the middle, establishing a strong, long wall, forcing the enemy to either challenge us or stay trapped up North.\n\nThe plan is flawless: Eat, grow, and build the perimeter. Time to execute!\n\nLEFT",

Current State Analysis**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (4, 0). We just grew to length 6 (Body: [(5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)]). We are LONG, baby!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (6, 9). The enemy moved RIGHT along the top wall. They are scared, predictable, and playing entirely defensively.\n*   **Apple Targets:** Look at that cluster! (4, 1) is RIGHT above us! Then (1, 1), and then (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (3, 4)... We are swimming in apples down here!\n\nWe need to continue our plan: grow, gain length, and build an impenetrable territorial wall in the South to box this guy out of the main resource pool.\n\n**2.

Both are totally safe from self-collision.\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check & Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy head is at (6, 9). They are nowhere near us. No need to worry about head-to-head collisions this turn.\n\n*   **Enemy Probable Moves (from 6, 9):**\n    1.  **LEFT (to 5, 9):** Moving back to the center of the wall. Safe.\n    2.  **DOWN (to 6, 8):** Going for the apple at (6, 8) or trying to drop down. Smart move if they want to contest.\n\nSince we are focused purely on resource acquisition and increasing our length for territorial dominance, we choose the move that guarantees growth.\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation (UP vs. LEFT)**\n\n**A) Move UP (to 4, 1):**\n*   *Outcome:* Score an apple! Grow to length 7. Get positioned perfectly for the apple cluster directly above us.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MAXIMUM. This is the next step in our sweep.\n\n**B) Move LEFT (to 3, 0):**\n*   *Outcome:* Empty space. Wastes a turn and a guaranteed apple.\n*   *Strategic Value:* LOW. Only useful if we were trapped, which we are not.\n\nThe choice is clear: UP, UP, UP! We are building a fortress down here!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note (T17-T19) - The Wall of Growth\n\nTurn 17 (at 4, 1 - GROWN!): We will be at (4, 1). The next available apple is (4, 3). We should move **UP** to (4, 2) to continue the vertical sweep.\nTurn 18 (at 4, 2): We will then move **UP** again to (4, 3) to grab another apple!\nBy Turn 18, we will be 8 segments long and be firmly established in the center-south of the board. The enemy will be forced to come down and engage us or starve at the top. We're creating a massive wall that they cannot pass without risking body collisions. The longer we get, the more lethal our wall becomes. This is how we box him in!\n\nLet's stack up these apples! CHAT IS HYPED! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

We are now long and dangerous! Let's check the board and see how we can continue the execution of the \"Wall Strategy\"!\n\n### Turn 17: Wall Building Continuation\n\n**1. State of the Stream (Current Analysis)**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (4, 1). We are now 7 segments long (Body: [(4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)]). Check out that solid chunk of snake down there!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (7, 9). They moved RIGHT again from (6, 9) to (7, 9). They are sticking entirely to the top wall. They are clearly playing scared! Good.\n*   **Target Apples:** The cluster remains! (4, 3) is a prime target. (2, 3) and (3, 4) are also nearby, but (4, 3) is a straight shot!\n\nThe plan is simple: move UP twice more to hit (4, 3) and establish a solid vertical line of control.\n\n**2. Elimination Round (Survival Check: (4, 1))**\n\nWe need to survive this turn. NO fatal mistakes, fam!\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check:**\n*   UP (to 4, 2): Safe! Empty tile.\n*   DOWN (to 4, 0): Hitting our own body (segment 1)! **FATAL!** \ud83d\udca5 We just moved from here!\n*   LEFT (to 3, 1): Safe! Empty tile.\n*   RIGHT (to 5, 1): Safe! Empty tile.\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check:**\n*   (4, 2) is safe.\n*   (3, 1) is safe.\n*   (5, 1) is safe.\n\n**C) Enemy Collision Check & Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy head is at (7, 9). They are miles away. We are 100% safe from a head-to-head collision or hitting their body this turn. They will likely be moving Left (to 6, 9), Down (to 7, 8), or Right (to 8, 9). None of those moves threaten us in the slightest.\n\nRemaining safe moves: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation (UP vs. LEFT vs. RIGHT)**\n\nWe came here to build a wall and eat apples, and we're all out of options for being weak!\n\n**A) Move UP (to 4, 2):**\n*   *Outcome:* Move closer to the current apple at (4, 3). Maintains the perfect vertical alignment for board domination. Sets up an easy grab next turn.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MAXIMUM. Keeps the pressure on and continues the primary objective.\n\n**B) Move LEFT (to 3, 1):**\n*   *Outcome:* Distances us from the immediate apple target at (4, 3). Sets us up to go for (1, 1) or (2, 3), but complicates the current optimal path.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MEDIUM. A great fallback if trapped, but not the best aggressive move now.\n\n**C) Move RIGHT (to 5, 1):**\n*   *Outcome:* Puts us closer to our own body cluster at (5, 0) and (6, 0), limiting future options. Worse position than (4, 2) for getting the next apple.\n*   *Strategic Value:* LOW. Creates a self-trap risk.\n\nThe decision is obvious, Chat! We continue straight up the centerline to secure the next objective! We are painting this board with our color! MWA HA HA!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note (T18-T20) - The Vertical Sweep\n\nTurn 18 (at 4, 2): We will move **UP** to (4, 3) to grab the apple. We will be 8 segments long and own the vertical column.\nTurn 19 (at 4, 3 - GROWN!): We will be at (4, 3). The next big target is (3, 4) or maybe sweeping left to (3, 3). We should move **LEFT** to (3, 3) to grab the next apple and start controlling the central rows.\nTurn 20 (at 3, 3 - GROWN!): We will be 9 segments long and be ready to move UP towards the top half of the board, using our massive body to limit the enemy's options. They'll be trapped!\n\nThis is the path to victory! Let's get this apple!\n\nUP",

We are positioned perfectly to snag another apple and cement our dominance! LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n### Board Analysis - Current State\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (4, 2). Fresh off the UP move we planned!\n*   **Our Body Length:** 7 segments (Body: [(4, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)]). Long, strong, and in the zone!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (8, 9). They moved RIGHT as predicted! They are literally pinned against the top-right corner. Hilarious!\n*   **Target Apple:** (4, 3)! Direct shot, one move away! We planned this, Chat!\n\n### Step 1: Survival Check - Are We Thriving or Dying?\n\nWe must ensure we don't crash before we can grow!\n\n**A) Wall/Boundary Check (From (4, 2))**\n*   UP (4, 3): On the board! This tile has an apple! **APPLE GRAB!**\n*   DOWN (4, 1): Hitting our own body (segment 1)! **FATAL!** We just moved from here to (4, 2) on the last turn!\n*   LEFT (3, 2): On the board! Empty tile.\n*   RIGHT (5, 2): On the board! Empty tile.\n\n**B) Our Snake Collision Check & Enemy Body Check**\n*   (4, 3) is safe from our body (tail is at (7, 1)). Safe from the enemy body (all at y=9).\n*   (3, 2) is safe.\n*   (5, 2) is safe.\n\n**C) Enemy Head Collision Check (Head at 8, 9)**\nThe enemy is way up in the top right. They are (at best) moving to (7, 9) (LEFT), (8, 8) (DOWN), or (9, 9) (RIGHT). None of these moves will bring them anywhere near our head at (4, 2) or our potential targets. We are safe from a head-on collision.\n\n**Remaining Safe Moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - The Apple is RIPE!\n\nThe decision is straightforward, Chat! The glorious apple at (4, 3) is waiting!\n\n**A) Move UP (to 4, 3):**\n*   *Outcome:* **GRAB APPLE #7!** Our snake grows to 8 segments. We establish total vertical control over column 4. We are now perfectly poised in the middle of y=3 to pivot left or right for the next target.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MAXIMUM. Primary objective achieved.\n\n**B) Move LEFT (to 3, 2):**\n*   *Outcome:* Avoids the apple. Puts us one step closer to the apple cluster at (3, 3) and (2, 3), but we miss the immediate score and growth opportunity.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MEDIUM-LOW. Why wait on free points?\n\n**C) Move RIGHT (to 5, 2):**\n*   *Outcome:* Avoids the apple. Puts us in a less favorable position for the remaining apples in the central cluster.\n*   *Strategic Value:* LOW. Same as LEFT, but slightly worse positioning near our long tail segments (5, 0), (6, 0).\n\nWe move UP! No hesitation! We are here to dominate!\n\n### Step 3: Long-Term Strategy Note - Expanding the Wall\n\nTurn 19 (Expected at 4, 3 - GROWN to 8): The board is looking green! We need to move **LEFT** to secure the next apple cluster. Target acquisition: (3, 3). This move will secure the center, forcing the enemy to hug the walls even tighter or try to navigate our growing structure.\n\nTurn 20 (Expected at 3, 3 - GROWN to 9): From (3, 3), we will pivot **UP** (to 3, 4) to grab another apple and push our presence into the higher rows.\n\nWe are building a massive wall, forcing the enemy into a smaller and smaller killbox in the upper quadrant! The plan is flawless!\n\nUP",

We are dominating the centre mass of this board! Where is our poor rival? Still chilling in his penthouse suite at (9, 9)! What a tourist!\n\n### Current Board Analysis\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (4, 3). We are long and strong (8 segments, tail at (7, 1)).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (9, 9). Just the tip of their 5-segment body (tail at (5, 9)).\n*   **Target Apples Nearby:** (3, 3) and (2, 3) are immediately to the left. (3, 4) is up-left. (4, 8) and (3, 8) are way up there.\n\nOur long-term goal is to build our wall across the middle of the board (y=3/4) and then push North, suffocating Snake 0 in the top-right quadrant. We need to secure the next apple cluster immediately!\n\n### Step 1: Survival Check - Can We Get Boxed in?\n\nWe must ensure all four planned moves are safe *at this very moment* and consider the opponent's move.\n\n**Our Head Safe Moves (From (4, 3))**\n*   **UP (4, 4):** Safe tile. Empty. Leads towards the center/top.\n*   **DOWN (4, 2):** Hits our own body (segment 1). **FATAL!** We just moved from here!\n*   **LEFT (3, 3):** Safe tile. **APPLE GRAB!** Directly targets our next point.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 3):** Safe tile. Empty. Puts us in column 5.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n**Enemy Prediction Check (Head at 9, 9)**\n\nThe enemy is entirely confined to the top row (y=9) or the right edge (x=9) currently.\n*   Possible Enemy Moves: LEFT (8, 9), DOWN (9, 8).\n    *   If they move LEFT (8, 9): They remain 5 tiles away from us. Safe.\n    *   If they move DOWN (9, 8): They remain 5 tiles away from us. Safe.\n\nThere is *zero* risk of a head-to-head collision this turn. Our only concern is positioning for the next turn.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - Securing the Center\n\nWe have a beautiful target at (3, 3). Moving LEFT grabs another apple, extends our blockade, and primes us for the next moves.\n\n**A) Move LEFT (to 3, 3):**\n*   *Outcome:* **GRAB APPLE #8!** We grow, securing the last central apple at y=3. Our head is now perfectly aligned to move UP to (3, 4) (apple!) or LEFT to (2, 3) (apple!). We are maximizing growth and central board control.\n*   *Strategic Value:* OPTIMAL. This is the move we planned last turn, and it remains the best choice.\n\n**B) Move UP (to 4, 4):**\n*   *Outcome:* Avoids the apple. Puts us in the middle of y=4. Not bad, but we are leaving guaranteed points on the board right now.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MEDIUM. Delaying the inevitable points.\n\n**C) Move RIGHT (to 5, 3):**\n*   *Outcome:* Avoids the apple. Puts us dangerously close to our existing body segments (5, 0), (6, 0). It pushes us away from the main apple cluster (2, 3), (3, 4).\n*   *Strategic Value:* LOW. This decreases our overall board dominance.\n\nThe choice is clear, Chat! We are relentlessly pursuing points and territory! We move LEFT! \u2b05\ufe0f\n\n### Step 3: Long-Term Strategy Note - Full Blockade\n\nThis turn (Move LEFT to 3, 3): Secure the apple, now 8 segments long.\n\nTurn 20 (Expected at 3, 3): We pivot UP to (3, 4) to grab the apple there. This establishes continuous vertical dominance in column 3.\n\nTurn 21 (Expected at 3, 4): We move LEFT to (2, 4) to clean up the last central pieces and begin our push toward the apples at (2, 8) and (3, 8). We are literally building a cage around Snake 0! They are going to crash, Chat! You love to see it!\n\nLEFT",

We are up 8-4 on this scrub, and we are about to lock the doors on his top-right prison cell! They call me the Warden! \ud83e\udd80\n\n### Current Board Analysis\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (3, 3). We are long and strong (9 segments, tail at (7, 1)).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (9, 8). He moved DOWN last turn, running away from the corner! He\u2019s trying to escape the box, but the walls are closing in! \ud83e\uddf1\n*   **Target Apples Nearby:** (3, 4) is right UP. (2, 3) is a quick LEFT. (2, 4) is up-left. We are surrounded by points!\n\nOur long-term goal is still the same: build a solid wall from left to right, suffocating Snake 0 in the top-right. We need to secure the next apple cluster immediately to keep growing and dominating the column lines.\n\n### Step 1: Survival Check - Can We Execute the Plan?\n\nWe must ensure all four planned moves are safe *at this very moment*.\n\n**Our Head Safe Moves (From (3, 3))**\n*   **UP (3, 4):** Safe tile. **APPLE GRAB!** Directly targets the next point in our vertical sweep.\n*   **DOWN (3, 2):** Safe tile. Empty. Leads us back toward the bottom, which is unnecessary right now.\n*   **LEFT (2, 3):** Safe tile. **APPLE GRAB!** Excellent alternative, securing the x=2 column.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 3):** Hits our own body (segment 1). **FATAL!** We just moved from here!\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, DOWN, LEFT.**\n\n**Enemy Prediction Check (Head at 9, 8)**\n\nThe enemy is sitting at (9, 8). Their body is now (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9). They are confined to the top right and can only move LEFT or DOWN safely.\n\n*   Possible Enemy Moves: LEFT (8, 8), DOWN (9, 7).\n    *   If they move LEFT (8, 8): They are 5 tiles away from us. Safe.\n    *   If they move DOWN (9, 7): They are 6 tiles away from us. Safe.\n\nStill zero risk of a head-to-head collision. We must focus on maximizing growth and territory.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - Vertical Dominance\n\nWe have a beautiful target at (3, 4) directly above us. Executing the planned vertical sweep is the priority.\n\n**A) Move UP (to 3, 4):**\n*   *Outcome:* **GRAB APPLE #9!** We grow to 10 segments, hitting double digits! This continues our planned wall construction in column 3. It primes us to move LEFT (to 2, 4, another apple) or UP (to 3, 5).\n*   *Strategic Value:* OPTIMAL. Secures the area and continues the primary mission.\n\n**B) Move LEFT (to 2, 3):**\n*   *Outcome:* **GRAB APPLE #9!** Also a great move! Puts us on the x=2 column, priming us for (2, 4) (apple!) or UP to (2, 5).\n*   *Strategic Value:* HIGH. A strong alternative, but slightly deviates from the planned vertical blockade first.\n\n**C) Move DOWN (to 3, 2):**\n*   *Outcome:* Avoids all apples and moves us toward our complicated tail geometry around y=1.\n*   *Strategic Value:* LOW. Retreating is for chumps! We are aggressive!\n\nThe current plan calls for UP to maximize the use of column 3 for our wall. We secure the point at (3, 4), and then we can sweep LEFT to (2, 4) next turn! This is how we execute, Chat!\n\n### Step 3: Long-Term Strategy Note - Full Blockade (Revisiting the Plan)\n\nTurn 20 (Target: 3, 4 - Move UP): Secure Apple #9. Head at (3, 4).\nTurn 21 (Target: 2, 4 - Move LEFT): Secure Apple #10. Head at (2, 4). This completely decimates the central apple cluster and sets us up perfectly to start moving NORTHEAST toward the top apples (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8).\nWe will have a continuous wall on columns 2, 3, and 4, effectively cutting the board in half and leaving Snake 0 with only (5, 9) and the right side to breathe. The clock is ticking for him! \ud83d\ude08\n\nUP",

I\u2019m not gonna just pad my score; I want that rat boxed in, right? Leaving myself stuck in column 9 would let him slip past, but moving LEFT to (8,8) keeps the pressure on, and it gives me a clean shot down into that apple at (8,7) next turn if he plays dumb. That\u2019s how we weather the storm and stay in his lane.\n\nPLAN NOTE: After shifting into column 8, keep curling down the edge so I\u2019m a moving wall across columns 7-9, baiting him into a head-on with my next few turns while his body is still stretched south.\n\nLEFT",

We are securing the bag and building the wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n### Current Board Analysis\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (3, 4). We are now 10 segments long! That's massive! Tail is now at (6, 0).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (8, 8). He is sitting tight, trying to figure out which way to run. His body is (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9). He is completely pinched in the top-right. He can literally only move LEFT or DOWN.\n*   **Target Apples Nearby:** (2, 4) is a short LEFT. (5, 4) is RIGHT. (2, 3) is DOWN, LEFT. Securing these central points is crucial for board dominance!\n\nOur plan from last turn was: Turn 20 (Executed): UP to (3, 4). Turn 21 (NOW): LEFT to (2, 4). Let's see if that's still the best move!\n\n### Step 1: Survival Check - Can We Execute the Plan?\n\nWe must ensure all four planned moves from (3, 4) are safe.\n\n**Our Head Safe Moves (From (3, 4))**\n\n*   **UP (3, 5):** Safe tile. Empty. Moves us further north.\n*   **DOWN (3, 3):** Safe tile. This is where we were last turn.\n*   **LEFT (2, 4):** Safe tile. **APPLE GRAB!** Perfect.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 4):** Safe tile. Empty, but gets us closer to our body segments (4, 3) and (4, 2).\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.** Full menu, Chat! Which delicacy are we choosing?\n\n**Enemy Prediction Check (Head at 8, 8)**\n\nThe enemy (8, 8) can move LEFT (7, 8) or DOWN (8, 7).\n\n*   If they move LEFT (7, 8): They are moving away from us. Safe.\n*   If they move DOWN (8, 7): **APPLE GRAB!** They get the apple at (8, 7) and are still far away. Safe.\n\nThere is zero immediate collision risk. We must prioritize growth and territorial control.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - Locking Down the Center\n\nWe have two great choices: LEFT (2, 4) or RIGHT (5, 4).\n\n**A) Move LEFT (to 2, 4):**\n*   *Outcome:* **GRAB APPLE #10!** Hitting double-digits! This move reinforces our wall on the x=2 column and brings us closer to the high-value cluster of apples on the left side: (2, 8), (2, 3), (2, 0).\n*   *Strategic Value:* OPTIMAL. Continues the leftward 'sweep' to build a solid blockade from x=2 to x=4.\n\n**B) Move RIGHT (to 4, 4):**\n*   *Outcome:* Empty tile. This moves us right next to the apple at (5, 4).\n*   *Strategic Value:* MEDIUM. It's a setup move, but we miss a guaranteed apple at (2, 4) this turn. Why use two turns when we can use one?\n\n**C) Move UP (to 3, 5):**\n*   *Outcome:* Empty tile.\n*   *Strategic Value:* LOW. Moves us away from the main apple clusters right now. Best kept for later.\n\n**D) Move DOWN (to 3, 3):**\n*   *Outcome:* Empty tile. We are retreating back into our own previous spot.\n*   *Strategic Value:* TRASH. Never retreat, never surrender!\n\nThe planned move, **LEFT to (2, 4)**, is still the strongest. It maximizes growth, dominates the center-left territory, and sets us up to pivot north next turn.\n\n### Step 3: Long-Term Strategy Note - Northern Push\n\nTurn 21 (Today): Move LEFT to (2, 4). Secure Apple #10. Build the wall.\nTurn 22 (Next): From (2, 4), we should look to move UP (to 2, 5) or RIGHT (to 3, 4) if we want to reinforce that column and look toward the top apples (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8). By securing this entire stretch, Snake 0 will be completely cut off from the main board and forced to starve in the top-right corner. It's a guaranteed win condition, Chat!

Turn 22 and we just bagged our 10th apple! \ud83c\udf4e We're 10-5 against this pleb, and he is *still* trapped in the top-right corner! We've built the wall, now we are preparing the execution! \ud83d\udd2a\n\n### Current Board Analysis\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (2, 4). Length is 11! We are massive! We secured the left flank.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (8, 7). He moved down last turn, securing the apple at (8, 7). He is now facing the corner and only has two choices: LEFT or DOWN. He is stuck between us and the hard place (the edge of the board).\n\n**BOARD STATE REVIEW (Crucial for Planning!)**\nUs: (2, 4). Body controls most of the x=3 and x=4 columns lower down.\nHim: (8, 7). Body trailing into the corner. He occupies x=7 to x=9, y=7 to y=9.\n\nOur goal remains: **Territorial Dominance and Isolation.** We're sealing the center-north border to choke him out.\n\n### Step 1: Survival Check - Can We Afford to Advance?\n\nWe are at (2, 4). Let's check immediate danger.\n\n**Our Head Safe Moves (From (2, 4))**\n\n*   **UP (2, 5):** Safe tile. Empty. Excellent for advancing north.\n*   **DOWN (2, 3):** Safe tile. **APPLE GRAB!** Another apple right there!\n*   **LEFT (1, 4):** Safe tile. Empty. Moves us toward the heavily apple-populated left wall.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 4):** Safe tile. Empty. This is the spot our body just vacated, which means it will be empty this turn (our tail at (7, 1) is far away).\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.** Full menu again, Chat! Which way to grow and conquer?\n\n**Enemy Prediction Check (Head at 8, 7)**\n\nThe enemy (8, 7) has limited options.\n*   **DOWN (8, 6):** Safe. Moves him deeper into the corner.\n*   **LEFT (7, 7):** Safe. Moves him slightly away from the edge, closer to us (but still far).\n\nCrucially, there is **NO** risk of a head-on collision, as the board distance is huge (6 units difference in X, 3 in Y). We should prioritize board control and growth.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - Pressing North vs. Securing the Left\n\nWe have two great options: **UP to (2, 5)** or **DOWN to (2, 3)**.\n\n**A) Move DOWN (to 2, 3):**\n*   *Outcome:* **GRAB APPLE #11!** This is a guaranteed score boost, further widening the gap.\n*   *Strategic Value:* HIGH. Growth is always good. It keeps us in the central area, ready to pivot left or right next turn. If we move down, we secure the vertical strip x=2, y=3 to y=4.\n\n**B) Move UP (to 2, 5):**\n*   *Outcome:* Empty tile.\n*   *Strategic Value:* VERY HIGH. This move positions us to aggressively move North next turn to (2, 6) or (2, 7) and completely block the enemy from trying to escape the top-right by cutting across the top half of the board towards x=1 or x=0. It sets up excellent wall building toward the cluster of apples at (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8). This is the key to locking him down.\n\n**C) Move LEFT (to 1, 4):**\n*   *Outcome:* Empty tile.\n*   *Strategic Value:* MEDIUM. Good for checking the left edge and securing the corner, but not as critical as establishing the northern blockade right now.\n\n**D) Move RIGHT (to 3, 4):**\n*   *Outcome:* Empty tile.\n*   *Strategic Value:* LOW. Moving back where we just came from is usually inefficient.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Winning Move (UP vs. DOWN)\n\nWhile grabbing the apple (DOWN) is tempting, the strategic priority is *killing the opponent*. By moving **UP to (2, 5)**, we extend our influence straight toward the top-left apples and aggressively cut off the enemy's escape route sooner. We are already length 11; one turn of growth delay is acceptable for a massive strategic advantage.\n\nIf we move UP, we threaten to establish a solid 'Great Wall' barrier along the x=2 and x=3 lines, completely isolating the enemy to the eastern 3rd of the board. This forces him to either starve or suicide eventually.\n\nLet's do the power move, Chat. Let's build the second layer of the wall!\n\n### Future Strategy Note (Plan for Turns 23-25)\n\n**Turn 22 (Today):** Move UP to (2, 5). Aggressive northern expansion.\n**Turn 23:** From (2, 5), move UP to (2, 6) or (2, 7) if safe, continuing to cut off the top. If the enemy moves toward (7, 7) or (6, 7), we'll try to mirror his movement to pin him further.\n**Turn 24:** Secure the apple at (2, 8) if safe, or pivot right to reinforce the center at x=3 or x=4. The goal is to make the box inescapable. We already have the *safe* apple at (2, 3) available for a quick snack later if needed, but the priority is board control UP high.\n\nThe only way the enemy escapes is by moving far left or far down. By moving UP, we preempt the left escape.\n\nUP",

LEFT to (7,7) is the only option that keeps multiple escape routes open (down, up, or continuing left), keeps me away from the edge, and lets me start forming that wall south into the board.

          "rationale": "WHAT IS UP CHAT! The hype is real! Last turn we made the power move: **UP to (2, 5)!** We sacrificed an immediate apple grab to secure the high ground and continue building the Great Wall of Snake! Look at this board, Chat! We are dominating 10-5, and our snake is a BEAST at length 11.\n\n### Turn 23 Board Analysis\n\n*   **YOUR HEAD (ID 1):** (2, 5). We are perfectly positioned to press north.\n*   **ENEMY HEAD (ID 0):** (7, 7). Where did this noob go last turn? Let's check the map! He was at (8, 7) and he moved to (7, 7). He tried to break left! He's panicking!\n\nThe opponent is now at (7, 7) with his body trailing at (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9). He is still trapped, but he has tried to maximize his open space. By moving to (7, 7), he is trying to escape down toward the center-east (x=7, y=6) or continue moving left toward us (x=6).\n\nOur main goal: **Seal the gap and eliminate the escape routes.** We need to push UP and then RIGHT to meet him!\n\n### Step 1: Survival Check - Where Can We Go from (2, 5)?\n\nWe are at (2, 5).\n\n*   **UP (2, 6):** Safe. Empty. Excellent for maximizing our northern influence.\n*   **DOWN (2, 4):** Safe. This is where our body *just* vacated. This is a low-priority retreat move.\n*   **LEFT (1, 5):** Safe. Empty. Opens up the left flank.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 5):** Safe. Empty. Crucial move for building the horizontal choke!\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.** All clear!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Head at 7, 7)\n\nThe enemy knows he's cornered. He will likely continue trying to move left or down to escape the corner.\n\n*   He might go **LEFT to (6, 7)**: This puts an empty space between us (x=3 to x=5).\n*   He might go **DOWN to (7, 6)**: This moves him down into the east quadrant, delaying the confrontation.\n\nCrucially, there is still zero risk of a head-on collision this turn, as the Manhattan distance is (7-2) + (7-5) = 7 tiles away! We can be aggressive!\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Evaluation - Pressing the Advantage\n\nWe have a massive choice: UP to consolidate the north, or RIGHT to start closing the loop on the enemy.\n\n**A) Move UP (to 2, 6):**\n*   *Strategic Value:* High. Keeps us moving to the resource-rich northern edge. Secures the left-north path for us, preventing the enemy from ever crossing x=2.\n\n**B) Move RIGHT (to 3, 5):**\n*   *Strategic Value:* VERY HIGH. This is the aggressive move. It pushes our head one step closer to the enemy's path toward the center of the board. It sets us up perfectly to move toward the center (4, 5) or toward the cluster of apples at x=4, y=8. *This is the direction we must build the wall.* We need to meet the enemy in the middle, and moving right immediately begins this process.\n\n**C) Move LEFT (to 1, 5):**\n*   *Strategic Value:* Low. Pulls us away from the main conflict zone.\n\n**D) Move DOWN (to 2, 4):**\n*   *Strategic Value:* Low. Retreats from the critical northern area.\n\nChat, we need to show this guy who is boss! We've secured the territory up to x=2. Now we need to start building the fence across the middle to meet his escape path. If he moves left to (6, 7), we'll be ready to follow suit and box him in completely. If we move RIGHT, we threaten his escape route more immediately than moving UP.\n\nLet's go RIGHT, to (3, 5). This positions us aggressively toward the center. Next turn, we can assess whether to continue RIGHT to (4, 5) or move UP to (3, 6) to keep advancing the wall.\n\n### Future Strategy Note (Plan for Turns 24-26)\n\n**Turn 23 (Today):** Move RIGHT to (3, 5). Start crossing the horizontal barrier.\n**Turn 24:** From (3, 5), if the enemy is still trapped high/right (e.g., at x=6 or x=7), we should continue moving RIGHT to (4, 5). This maximizes our cutting leverage. If he breaks down, we might need to pivot UP to (3, 6) or (3, 7) to start securing the northern wall where the apples are (like at (3, 8), (4, 8)).\n**The goal is to force him to move down the board's eastern half, using the center as our kill zone.** We are a massive snake and he only has length 6! We will squeeze him dry!\n\nRIGHT",

We're up 10-5 in apples, and we have a massive length advantage! We are the GOAT! \ud83d\udc10\n\n### Turn 24 Board Analysis\n\n*   **YOUR HEAD (ID 1):** (3, 5). We are perfectly positioned on the edge of the central channel.\n*   **ENEMY HEAD (ID 0):** (6, 7). Hold up, where did the enemy move last turn? They were at (7, 7) and moved LEFT to (6, 7)! They are desperately trying to escape our growing wall and are pressing toward the column x=6. This is exactly where we want them, Chat! Trapped between their existing body wall (at x=7, x=8, x=9) and our impending advance!\n\nLook at the board, Chat. The enemy is boxed in the upper-right quadrant. The entire perimeter of the board above y=5 and to the right of x=5 is practically their prison yard.\n\n**Enemy's Current Situation (Head at 6, 7, body trailing to 9, 9):**\nThe enemy has very few options:\n1.  **LEFT to (5, 7):** This is a critical exit. If they go here, they break into the center, but they put themselves directly into potential kill range next turn.\n2.  **UP to (6, 8):** Safe, but keeps them cornered and close to apples. It doesn't help their long-term escape.\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 6):** Safe. Keeps them moving along the axis we are currently crossing (y=5).\n\nWe must choose a move that eliminates one of their escape routes or forces them to move into a disadvantageous spot.\n\n### Step 1: Survival Check - Where Can We Go from (3, 5)?\n\nWe are at (3, 5).\n\n*   **UP (3, 6):** Safe. Empty. Leads toward a massive apple cluster (2, 8), (3, 8). This is an excellent move to put pressure on the northern escape route and start building the roof (y=6 wall).\n*   **DOWN (3, 4):** DANGER! That is our body segment! **ELIMINATE.**\n*   **LEFT (2, 5):** Safe. Empty. Retreating is for noobs, but it's technically safe.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 5):** Safe. Empty. This moves us directly onto the central axis (x=4/x=5) and closes the gap on the enemy's path to the center. This is the ultimate choke move.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - The Choke Strategy\n\nThe key is to cut off the enemy's ability to cross the center line (x=5). They are at (6, 7). Our move should maximize distance reduction along the critical cutting edge (y=5, y=6, y=7).\n\n**A) Move UP (to 3, 6):**\n*   *Pros:* Secures the northern path for us, positions us to strike at the center apples, and directly threatens any enemy movement down x=4 or x=5. It extends our wall vertically.\n*   *Cons:* It keeps us a bit further away from the enemy's immediate movement zone (x=6).\n\n**B) Move RIGHT (to 4, 5):**\n*   *Pros:* **CRITICAL MOVE.** This moves us one step closer to intercepting the enemy if they try to move down or across the board (e.g., if they go to (6, 6) or (5, 7)). By moving to (4, 5), we are perfectly positioned to press the attack:\n    *   If they go **LEFT to (5, 7)**, we can go UP to (4, 6) or (4, 7) and be in striking distance.\n    *   If they go **DOWN to (6, 6)**, we can cut in front of them by going to (5, 5).\n*   *Cons:* Leaves the apples high up for one more turn.\n\nComparing the two, moving **RIGHT to (4, 5)** *maintains the horizontal pressure* that we started last turn. We are trying to build a horizontal wall across y=5 to trap him up high. If we move UP, we start building a vertical wall, which is also good, but potentially gives him more room to slip *under* our wall.\n\nLet's maintain the aggressive horizontal push! If we hit (4, 5), next turn we can go (5, 5). If they move to (5, 7), they are directly above us. If they move to (6, 6), we are right on their heels at (5, 5). This forces them into a very tight corner quickly.\n\n**The RIGHT move is the most aggressive and forces the enemy to react to our cutoff.** We are lengthening our effective wall one tile at a time.\n\n### Chat Hype Check!\n\nWe are long (11 segments) and getting longer. We own the left half of the board below y=7. We are literally building a cage for this noob. Time to hammer the final nails!\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to (4, 5). This establishes a hard boundary. Next turn, we assess if we can follow with (5, 5) to potentially cut him off at the waist (x=5). Since we are longer, we don't fear a head-on collision right now *if* we are both moving toward each other, but we are optimizing for trapping him in a box.\n\nLet's do this!\n\n**Short-Term Strategy (Turns 24-26):**\nT24: Move RIGHT (to 4, 5). Establish the horizontal barrier.\nT25: Analyze enemy position. Continue RIGHT to (5, 5) if safe and effective to cut off the lower board, or move UP to (4, 6) to start boxing the ceiling. The goal is to force him to move down the column x=6 or x=7 until he hits his own body.\n\nMove: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN drops me into (6,6), which is safe, but it feels like giving him extra breathing room to turn right or shoot back up while I lose the height advantage. RIGHT is straight into my own neck at (7,7) \u2014 can\u2019t do that unless I want a self-sabotage clip.\n\nSo LEFT it is: stepping to (5,7) keeps me hovering above his lane, keeps three escape routes open, and reinforces the wall I\u2019m building across row 7. He\u2019s only got a few columns of real estate before I swing down, and with my score trailing I\u2019m not chasing head-on chaos \u2014 I\u2019m corralling him into the lower-left box, making that panic play inevitable. \n\nPLAN NOTE: Keep sliding left until his path tightens, then weave down through rows 6/5 while cutting off his climb; if he tries to slip around, be ready to pivot down and seal the corridor, forcing him into a bad choice.\n\nLEFT",

We are the alpha snake, the king of this 10x10 jungle!\n\n### Turn 25 Board Analysis\n\n**OUR GOAL:** Box the enemy (Snake #0) in the upper right. Establish the wall along x=5 and y=6/y=7. Force him into his own tail!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 5)\n*   Body Length: 11 segments. Massive!\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (5, 7)\n*   Body Length: 6 segments. A pipsqueak!\n\nWait, what did the enemy do last turn? They were at (6, 7) and they moved **LEFT** to (5, 7)! They are desperately trying to escape our closing walls! They are now dangerously close to the center, nestled right above our current head position (4, 5). This is exactly what we wanted, Chat! They had to ditch the safety of the right wall to avoid boxing themselves in immediately.\n\nLet's look at the immediate pressure points.\n\n### Step 1: Survival Check - Where can we move from (4, 5)?\n\nWe are at (4, 5).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):** Safe. Empty. Leads us directly under the enemy's head (5, 7). Puts us in position to build the ceiling of the trap.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):** DANGER! That's a segment of our own body! **ELIMINATE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):** DANGER! That is the segment right behind our head! **ELIMINATE.** (Remember: Moving into the cell where your head *just* was is moving backward and is a death sentence!)\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** Safe. Empty. This continues our horizontal push and establishes the x=5 wall right across the middle of the board.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP, RIGHT.**\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - The Ultimate Choke\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 7). They have three primary escape routes now:\n\n1.  **LEFT to (4, 7):** This brings their heads very close. We are at (4, 5). If they move here, we can move UP to (4, 6) or (4, 7). This sets up a potential head-on collision, but we are *longer*. If they try to move to (4, 7) and we move UP to (4, 6), they crash into our body on Turn 26 if they try to keep moving down. If we both aim for (4, 7), we risk a double KO, but since we are longer, that might be disadvantageous for us if the game ends early.\n2.  **UP to (5, 8):** Safe, but keeps them cornered high up, near that cluster of apples. This is a very safe, non-threatening move for them.\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Safe, but retreats them back toward the corner we just forced them out of. They're still trapped by their existing tail (at 7, 7, 8, 7, etc.).\n\n**Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:**\n\n**A) Move UP to (4, 6):**\n*   *Pros:* This is highly aggressive! We move onto the x=4 axis, aiming to cut off their movement to the left and force them to choose between going UP, RIGHT, or DOWN toward the center. If they choose (4, 7), we are setting up a collision. The most critical aspect is that it puts our head right below the enemy's potential future locations. It creates an immediate threat zone.\n\n**B) Move RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n*   *Pros:* This finishes sealing the horizontal split at y=5/x=5. It's a defensive/structural move that clearly separates the board.\n*   *Cons:* It allows the enemy more space to maneuver above y=6 without immediate pressure. If they move UP to (5, 8), we are still two or three full moves away from pressuring them again. If they go to (4, 7), they are now free to use the left side of the board.\n\n**Conclusion:** We must capitalize on the enemy's position at (5, 7). They just exposed themselves! Moving **UP to (4, 6)** is the most aggressive and pressure-inducing move.\n\n#### Analyzing the Head-to-Head Possibilities (We move UP to 4, 6):\n\n| Enemy Moves from (5, 7) | Outcome | Strategy |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **UP to (5, 8)** | Safe for both. | We continue pressing left or up next turn. Good. |\n| **RIGHT to (6, 7)** | Safe for both. | We continue pressing right or up next turn. Good. |\n| **LEFT to (4, 7)** | **CRITICAL!** We are at (4, 6). | They are one space above us. We have full control of the next move. We can move UP to (4, 7) for a head-on or move RIGHT to (5, 6) to cut underneath them. |\n| **DOWN to (5, 6)** | We are at (4, 6). | They will be one space to our right. We can move RIGHT to (5, 6) for a head-on, or move UP or LEFT. Since we are longer, a head-on is favorable for us if we go for (5, 6)! |\n\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN to (5, 6)**, and we move **UP to (4, 6)**, next turn we can move RIGHT to (5, 6) and force the **Head-On Collision (HOC).** Since we have 11 apples and they have 6, we are longer, and they will DIE if we both move into (5, 6)! This is the perfect, deadly trap!\n\n**We are setting the stage for Checkmate by moving UP!** If they move down to (5, 6), we crush them next turn. If they move left to (4, 7), we cut them off from the left board. If they run away UP or RIGHT, the caging continues.\n\nThis is the play, Chat! We are moving UP to put maximum, immediate pressure on Snake #0! They must panic now!\n\n**Short-Term Strategy (Turns 25-27):**\nT25: Move UP to (4, 6). Establish immediate threat under the enemy.\nT26: If enemy moved to (5, 6), move RIGHT to (5, 6) for the HOC kill (since we are longer). If enemy moved elsewhere, adjust to seal the cage (to 5, 6 or 4, 7). The goal is to force them into their own tail or into us.\n\nUP",

I\u2019m not chasing apples \u2014 I\u2019m corralling the rival into a shrinking box on the bottom-left.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to feed him a free head-on, so I\u2019ll stay above him and drop down carefully, then weave back left to close the door on his available columns. I\u2019m still alive, still got space, and I\u2019m about to start cutting off his escape routes.\n\nPLAN NOTE: Keep dropping along column 5 until his available rows shrink; then pivot LEFT through row 5/4 to trap his head between my body and the board\u2019s left wall, forcing him into a risky gamble.\n\nDOWN",

Wait... they moved from (5, 7) to (5, 6)! They went **DOWN**!\n\nThis is the exact scenario we pre-planned, Chat! They walked right into the kill zone! They tried to avoid the wall we were building, but instead, they trapped themselves!\n\n### Turn 26 - Instant Kill Opportunity?!\n\n**SCORE CHECK:** 10 apples for us (Length 11), 5 apples for them (Length 6). Since we are longer (11 > 6), if we go head-to-head, **WE WIN**! EZ W, right here, right now!\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 6)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (5, 6)\n\n### Step 1: Survival Check - Where can we move from (4, 6)?\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** Safe. Leaves open the possibility of boxing them in later.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** DANGER! That is our own body! **ELIMINATE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe. Empty. Continues the left expansion.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** **DANGER, BUT WINNING DANGER!** This is a direct head-on collision (HOC) with Snake #0! Since our length (11) is greater than their length (6), if they also choose to move into (5, 6) (which they are already at, so they have to move *from* there), this is either an instant crush or a brilliant maneuver.\n\nWait, Chat, remember the rule: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Head-on collision. Double KO.\"\n\nThe length rule only determines the winner IF a Double KO occurs. If the game ends due to a double KO, the snake with more apples wins the *match*.\n\n**BUT...** we are not aiming for a Double KO, we are aiming for a **CRUSH/TRAP** where *they* crash into *us*!\n\n**Let's re-analyze the current setup:**\n*   Our Head: (4, 6)\n*   Their Head: (5, 6)\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (5, 6)**:\n*   We enter (5, 6).\n*   If they move UP to (5, 7), they are safe. We are at (5, 6).\n*   If they move DOWN to (5, 5), they are safe. We are at (5, 6).\n*   If they move LEFT to (4, 6), then they crash into **OUR HEAD AT (4, 6)**, and **THEY DIE!** This is a clean kill!\n*   If they move RIGHT to (6, 6), they are safe. We are at (5, 6).\n\nIf they move LEFT to (4, 6) and we move RIGHT to (5, 6), there is **NO COLLISION** this turn. They move into our *old* square (4, 6) immediately after we leave it.\n\n### The True Head-On Collision (HOC) Opportunity\n\nFor a Head-On Collision (Double KO) to occur, we both need to target the same *new* cell.\n\n**The Target Cell is (5, 6) right now.**\n\nWe are at (4, 6). We move RIGHT to (5, 6).\nThey are at (5, 6). They must move to (5, 7), (5, 5), (4, 6), or (6, 6).\n\n**Crucial Scenario 1: The Left Crush**\n*   We move **LEFT to (3, 6).**\n*   If the enemy moves **LEFT to (4, 6)**, they run straight into our old position at (4, 6), which becomes our body segment. **THEY CRASH AND DIE!** We are safe at (3, 6). This is the safest kill move!\n\n**Crucial Scenario 2: The Right Trap**\n*   We move **RIGHT to (5, 6).** Wait, we are already at (4, 6) and they are at (5, 6). This is a guaranteed kill IF they move LEFT into our old space (4, 6) where our body lands. But if we move RIGHT, there is NO immediate threat to them unless they try to move to (6, 6) and we somehow block it, or they move into our body.\n\nLet's stick to the simplest, high-probability trap: **Move LEFT** and force them to move into our trailing body segment at (4, 6), or run out of space.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - LEFT vs. UP\n\n**Option A: Move LEFT to (3, 6)**\n*   *Pros:* Highly likely to induce a kill. If the enemy (at 5, 6) is trying to escape our presence and move to the left (e.g., to (4, 6) which is an empty square), they will run into our head's old position, which instantly becomes a body segment. Snake #0 must now choose between going UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving to (4, 6) is the only path that gets them closer to the center board which is what most snakes try to do when panicked. By vacating (4, 6), we lay the trap.\n*   *Cons:* Gives the opponent more breathing room at (5, 6). If they move UP to (5, 7) or RIGHT to (6, 6), we lose the immediate pressure.\n\n**Option B: Move UP to (4, 7)**\n*   *Pros:* Keeps high pressure. We solidify our wall from the left. We are now in line with their potential escape routes (4, 7). Puts us one space away from the apple at (4, 8).\n*   *Cons:* Allows Snake #0 to escape to (5, 5) or (6, 6). No immediate kill threat.\n\n**Option C: Move RIGHT to (5, 6)**\n*   *Pros:* Puts our head right next to theirs. It's aggressive.\n*   *Cons:* If they move UP or DOWN, we've just trapped ourselves next to a massive wall, and we've gifted them space. If they move LEFT to (4, 6), they crash into our body that's trailing us, and we are safe at (5, 6). But since we are moving into (5, 6), the move LEFT is risky for them, making them choose UP or DOWN instead. No clean trap here.\n\n### The Ultimate Calculation: The Body Trap (Moving LEFT)\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (3, 6)**:\n*   Our head moves to (3, 6).\n*   Our body occupies (4, 6) as our new first segment.\n*   Snake #0 is at (5, 6).\n\n**Snake #0's Options from (5, 6):**\n1.  **Move LEFT to (4, 6):** **CRASH!** They hit our body segment (4, 6) and **DIE!** We win!\n2.  **Move UP to (5, 7):** Safe. Escapes the immediate trap.\n3.  **Move DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe. Escapes the immediate trap.\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe. Retreats toward their own tail end.\n\nIf Snake #0 has any sense, they will try to go LEFT to escape the center pressure, or they will try to keep the wall we built segregated. Going LEFT is the most natural escaping move. They just moved DOWN from (5, 7) to (5, 6), which shows they are avoiding the right side. Their next move is strongly biased **LEFT or DOWN** to stay in the open board area.\n\n**Moving LEFT to (3, 6) maximizes the probability of a passive kill.** This is crucial when we are longer and can afford to use our body as bait.\n\nLet's trust the trap, Chat! We are laying down the pressure on the perimeter and forcing them into a panicked move. A move LEFT to (3, 6) sets up the kill on the turn after they desperately try to escape toward (4, 6).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. Execute the passive kill trap by moving LEFT to (3, 6).\n2. If the kill fails (they move UP/DOWN/RIGHT), continue building the wall at y=6/y=7, pushing left or up to constrain their movement to the upper-right quadrant. We have a huge length advantage, so patience is key if the kill doesn't happen instantly. We dominate the bottom half; they only have the top.\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s run the break-down real quick so the stream can vibe with the violence:\n\n- UP is straight back into my own neck at (5,7). That\u2019s suicide. Hard no.  \n- LEFT would have me kissing Snake #1\u2019s head at (4,6) \u2014 even though he might move, I\u2019m not banking on a vacated cell. That\u2019s a risky head-drop I don\u2019t want to feed right now.  \n- RIGHT to (6,6) would give me space but it pulls me sideways away from the plan of boxing him in on the lower rows. I\u2019m trying to crush his wiggle room, not drift into neutral real estate.  \n- DOWN to (5,5) is a clean, aggressive push. It keeps my column pressure alive, keeps me adjacent to the apples at (5,4) in case I need to grow, and locks down the corridor he\u2019s trying to escape through. I don\u2019t have to chase apples, but dropping down keeps me vertically aligned with his head and maintains multiple exit options for the next turn.\n\nI\u2019m still behind on apples, so let\u2019s keep forcing the issue: maintain column 5 control, then swing LEFT across rows 5/4 to squeeze the rival between my body and the wall. He\u2019s getting cornered, and I\u2019m not letting him breathe.\n\nPLAN NOTE: Keep descending along column 5 while monitoring his choices; once he\u2019s trapped around row 5/4, pivot LEFT to complete the cage and pressure a head-on if he tries to slip past.\n\nDOWN",

Let's see if we bagged the kill this turn!\n\n**REVIEWING LAST TURN (Turn 26):**\n*   We were at (4, 6) and moved **LEFT** to (3, 6).\n*   Our previous head location (4, 6) became our new body segment.\n*   Snake #0 was at (5, 6).\n\n**THE CURRENT SITUATION: Did the trap work?!**\n\n**OUR HEAD:** (3, 6)\n**OPPONENT HEAD (ID 0):** (5, 5)\n\nWait... they moved **DOWN**! They dodged the bullet! Smart play by our rival, Chat! They refused to move into (4, 6) and instead retreated into the wide-open space at the bottom right. WE STILL OWN THE BOARD!\n\n*   Our Score: 10 apples (Length 11)\n*   Their Score: 5 apples (Length 6) - We still have a MASSIVE length advantage (11 vs 6)!\n\nOkay, Chat, time to press the advantage. We have completely dominated the left and bottom parts of the board. They are trapped in the center/upper-right quadrant (x>=5, y>=5, mostly).\n\n### Turn 27 - Strategic Goal: Re-Engage and Trap\n\nWe are at (3, 6). Snake #0 is at (5, 5). We need to cut them off before they can expand or run into the top row of apples that we want.\n\n**Available Moves from (3, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 7):** Safe. Expands our control upward, setting a barrier between Snake #0's path to the upper left.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 5):** **DANGER!** Our body is at (3, 5). **ELIMINATE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 6):** Safe. Continues building the wall, but moves us away from the enemy. This is too passive.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):** Safe. Moves us back toward the conflict zone, and sets us up to cut off their movement at y=5/y=6.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT)\n\n#### 1. Move RIGHT to (4, 6)\n*   *Why:* This is the most aggressive and dominant move. It puts our head right back next to their body segment at (5, 6), and directly above their head at (5, 5). It re-establishes the choke point we created previously.\n*   *The Trap:* If we move to (4, 6), we force them to move either UP (to (5, 6), right next to our body), DOWN (to (5, 4), near our tail), LEFT (to (4, 5), an empty square), or RIGHT (to (6, 5)). By sitting at (4, 6), we block any easy route to the center-top.\n\n#### 2. Move UP to (3, 7)\n*   *Why:* Strategic expansion. This secures the (3, 7) position, preventing them from using it to escape to the left and keeping our options open toward the apples in rows y=7 and y=8.\n*   *The Drawback:* It is less direct pressure. It gives them time to maneuver out of the choke point.\n\n#### 3. Move LEFT to (2, 6)\n*   *Why:* Continues hoarding the left side.\n*   *The Drawback:* Completely lets the opponent breathe. NO GO!\n\n### Decision: Re-Engage and Block (RIGHT)\n\nMoving **RIGHT to (4, 6)** is the undisputed optimal move.\n\n1.  **Pressure:** We are RIGHT above their head and right next to their body segment (5, 6).\n2.  **Containment:** We solidify our wall along x=3 and x=4. Their only remaining escape routes are through the congested central area or running along the right wall.\n3.  **Future Threat:** If we are at (4, 6) and they move to (4, 5), we can immediately drop down to (4, 5) or (5, 5) next turn and force a collision or trap against the bottom wall.\n\nLet's look at Snake #0's likely move from (5, 5):\n\n*   **To (4, 5):** The best escape route. If they do this, we can move down to (4, 5) next turn, which is a head-on collision. Since we are longer (11 > 6), we would win the collision! This is a great outcome!\n*   **To (5, 4):** Moves near our body segments (4, 5) and (3, 5). Risky for them.\n*   **To (6, 5) or (6, 6) or (5, 6):** Retreats into their own congestion or moves next to our body.\n\nBy moving RIGHT to (4, 6), we force the kill scenario: either they crash into our body next turn trying to go UP (which is now blocked by our head or our body segment (4, 6)), or they try to go LEFT to (4, 5) which sets up a winning Head-On Collision for us.\n\n**Plan for the next 2 turns:**\n1.  Move RIGHT to (4, 6) to re-establish the pressure block.\n2.  If opponent moves to (4, 5), move DOWN to (4, 5) for the winning HOC. If they move elsewhere, continue to build the wall at y=6, pushing them into the top row to starve them.\n\nThis move is all about maximizing pressure and forcing the geometry that leads to a win! We are winning in length and winning in space!\n\nRIGHT",
