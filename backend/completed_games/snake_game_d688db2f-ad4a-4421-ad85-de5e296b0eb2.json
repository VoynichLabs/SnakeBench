I see that snake #1 at (7,5) and I'm at (2,2) - he's closer to some apples but I got this.\n\nLet's break down the board real quick:\n- Apples at: (9,0), (7,8), (9,5), (6,6), (0,5), (5,1), (5,0), (1,5), (3,5), (8,5), (2,5), (1,2), (8,4), (7,0), (4,8)\n- I'm at (2,2) with no body yet\n- Snake #1 at (7,5) also with no body\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\nChecking my possible moves from (2,2):\n1. **UP to (2,3)**: On board? \u2705. Into my own body? \u2705 (none). Into enemy body? \u2705 (he's at 7,5). SAFE.\n2. **DOWN to (2,1)**: On board? \u2705. Into my own body? \u2705. Into enemy body? \u2705. SAFE.\n3. **LEFT to (1,2)**: On board? \u2705. Into my own body? \u2705. Into enemy body? \u2705. BUT WAIT! (1,2) has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e This is the move! I get +1 point and grow!\n4. **RIGHT to (3,2)**: On board? \u2705. Into my own body? \u2705. Into enemy body? \u2705. SAFE.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:** LEFT to (1,2)!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nWhy this is genius:\n- I eat an apple immediately (first blood!)\n- I go from 0 to 1 point, taking the lead\n- I'm moving towards the center apples cluster at (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (0,5)\n- Snake #1 is way over at (7,5) - I'm establishing dominance in MY territory\n- This opens up future moves to either (1,3) UP or (0,5) LEFT or (2,5) RIGHT next turn\n- The enemy is probably going for the apple at (8,5) or (9,5) - let him have those, I'm boxing him out of the left side!\n\nStrategic note to future me: \"Take left side control. Enemy is right-side focused. Cluster at (1,5)-(3,5) is mine. Once I grow, I can start cutting him off from accessing the center.\"\n\n**YEAH BABY, THAT'S THE CONTENT RIGHT THERE!** Let's GOOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Board shows apples sprinkled, but we\u2019re laser-focused on the enemy and on forcing pressure. Here\u2019s the readout:\n\n- SAFE OPTIONS from (7,5): \n  - UP -> (7,6)\n  - DOWN -> (7,4)\n  - LEFT -> (6,5)\n  - RIGHT -> (8,5)  (this one actually eats an apple on the way)\n\n- WHY RIGHT is the best opening play:\n  - It immediate gains a point by eating the apple at (8,5), growing our length to 2 without risk (no opponent body nearby to contest that cell).\n  - It buys time and creates a straight chase along the right flank, which is open space for future re-angles and plans.\n  - It prevents any chance of turning into our own body on a forced backstep on this first move (we\u2019ll have a body behind us after the move, so we can\u2019t backtrack safely anyway).\n\n- FUTURE window after Right to (8,5):\n  - Next turn, we can still go UP (8,6), DOWN (8,4), or RIGHT (9,5). Left would collide with our own body (the cell (7,5) becomes part of our body after the growth), so that\u2019s a dead option post-growth.\n  - Apple at (9,5) is tempting to chain for another growth if it remains safe (it\u2019s on the edge, but doable). This keeps us elongated and gives us more room to pressure the map and the opponent.\n\n- ENEMY considerations:\n  - Opponent is far at (2,2) with no body to collide with yet; we\u2019re not in immediate risk of a head-on, and we\u2019re not boxed in by walls on the right edge yet either.\n  - Our goal remains to dominate space and threaten potential head-on returns if we can build a multi-apple lead later.\n\n- SHORT PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:\n  - Turn 1: Move RIGHT to (8,5) and eat the apple. Grow to length 2, head at (8,5), body at (7,5).\n  - Turn 2: If apple at (9,5) still present and safe, move RIGHT to (9,5) to grab it (length grows again). If that feels risky (due to possible trap lines), instead go UP to (8,6) to keep options open and keep pressure on the top-right corridor.\n  - Turn 3+: Use the extended length to create potential bottlenecks or force safer paths for the enemy, while avoiding a trap-like dead-end. Keep eyes on the distance to the opponent and look for opportunities to threaten or force a head-on only if it benefits the score balance.\n\nDecision: RIGHT\n\nright",

Now I'm at (1,2) with an apple consumed - I'm officially at 2 apples! Snake #1 is still at 1 apple. \n\nBoard assessment:\n- My head: (1,2), body: [(2,2)] (I moved left from (2,2) so my tail stayed at (2,2))\n- Enemy head: (8,5), body: [(7,5)]\n- Apples remaining: (9,0), (7,8), (9,5), (6,6), (0,5), (5,1), (5,0), (1,5), (3,5), (2,5), (8,4), (7,0), (4,8), (9,7), (2,9)\n- Notice (1,2) is no longer an apple (I ate it)\n- (2,2) was never an apple in the list - actually (2,5) and (2,9) are apples\n\nFrom my current position (1,2), possible moves:\n\n1. **UP to (1,3)**: On board? \u2705. Into my own body? Check: My body is [(2,2)] - (1,3) not in body. \u2705. Into enemy body? Enemy body at [(7,5)] - not there. \u2705. SAFE.\n2. **DOWN to (1,1)**: On board? \u2705. Into my own body? (1,1) \u2260 (2,2). \u2705. Into enemy body? No. \u2705. SAFE.\n3. **LEFT to (0,2)**: On board? \u2705. Into my own body? (0,2) \u2260 (2,2). \u2705. Into enemy body? No. \u2705. SAFE.\n4. **RIGHT to (2,2)**: On board? \u2705. Into my own body? (2,2) IS in my body! \u274c This would kill me - moving back into my own tail. DEAD.\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated immediately - that's suicide!\n\nNow considering the other three safe moves:\n- (0,2): Left side, no apple immediate. Opens to (0,1), (0,3) or back to (1,2) but (1,2) will be my body next turn.\n- (1,1): Down, no apple immediate. Near apple at (5,1) but that's far.\n- (1,3): Up, no apple immediate but leads toward the apple cluster at (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (0,5)\n\nMy strategy is to control the left/center. Snake #1 is at (8,5) - they're going for right side apples like (9,5), (8,4), (7,8).\n\nIf I go UP to (1,3):\n- Next turn I can potentially go UP to (1,4) then (1,5) for an apple\n- Or RIGHT to (2,3) towards the (2,5) apple cluster\n- Keeps me central and mobile\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,2):\n- I trap myself near left wall, limiting options\n- Less mobility overall\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,1):\n- Moves away from the apple cluster\n- Gets me closer to (5,1) but that's still far\n\n**THE PLAY:** UP to (1,3)!! \n\nWhy? \n- Moves TOWARDS the center apple cluster ((1,5), (2,5), (3,5))\n- Keeps me flexible with multiple directions next turn\n- Maintains distance from enemy (he's at 8,5, I'm at 1,2 - we're on opposite sides)\n- I have 2 apples vs his 1 - I can afford to play positionally\n\nLong-term plan: Control the left side of center. Once I get to (1,3), I'll have options to reach (1,5) in 2 moves or flank to (2,5)/(3,5). Snake #1 is chasing the right side - let him, I'll dominate the center-left zone.\n\nLet's gooooo!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Turn 1 incoming.\n\nCurrent readout:\n- Head (our snake): (8, 5)\n- Opponent head: (1, 2) with body at (2, 2)\n- Safe options from (8, 5): UP (8,6), DOWN (8,4), RIGHT (9,5). LEFT would crash into our own body.\n- Apple density on the right edge is real: (9,5) is an apple, (9,7) is an apple, etc. So a RIGHT move on Turn 1 grabs a tasty upgrade and drags us into a strong right-side corridor.\n\nWhy RIGHT is the play:\n- Immediate growth: eating the apple at (9,5) boosts our length and seals more control on the right flank.\n- Space to maneuver: we jump onto the edge without risking an early collision with the opponent (he\u2019s far bottom-left). The right edge gives clean up/down options next turns.\n- Head-to-head pressure potential: with a longer body tracing along the row 5/9 corridor, we can threaten tight turns and force the enemy into awkward routes later.\n\nPotential risks:\n- We\u2019ll be edge-bound after this, so we must avoid letting the tail close a dead-end loop around us. The move options after RIGHT will be UP or DOWN; we can pivot based on opponent positioning to avoid corner traps.\n\nLong-term strategy note (for the next few turns):\n- Use the right edge to build a long, straight spine. Move UP after grabbing (9,5) to pressure (9,6) and (9,7) to snag the next apple, further increasing our length and domination on the right side.\n- Keep an eye on the opponent; if he starts drifting toward the bottom area, steer to maintain distance while preserving escape routes. If a favorable head-on setup emerges with the enemy in a narrow corridor, be prepared to force it only when our apple count (and thus your score) makes the risk worth it.\n- Avoid trapping yourself in a tight loop; maintain at least two safe follow-ups after each move.\n\nShort-term plan (Turn-by-turn mindset for the next 3 turns):\n- Turn 1: RIGHT to (9,5) eat the apple, grow to length 3, head at (9,5).\n- Turn 2: If safe, UP to (9,6) to push the right edge corridor vertically; if you see risk, DOWN to (9,4) to hedge.\n- Turn 3: Continue riding the edge toward (9,7) to grab the next apple on the edge and extend your reach; maintain space to dodge the enemy.\n\nBottom line: we\u2019re punishing space on the right, growing our length, and setting up a corridor trap later. We stay aggressive but patient, pressuring him with a long, top-right-to-bottom-right chain.\n\nRIGHT",

They're growing! Their body is now [(6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6)] (assuming they ate at (5,8)).

They're trying to break out to the left side.\n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKTHROUGH:**\nGUYS, I need to CUT OFF their escape routes to the left! The enemy just grew and is trying to break out of their corner. I need to control the left wall and push them into a trap!\n\n**UP to (0,8) is the PLAY because:**\n1. SAFE move - avoids all death zones\n2. Moves me to the top-left corner (0,8)\n3. From (0,8), I can go RIGHT to (1,8) or DOWN to (0,7) next turn\n4. This position helps me control the left edge and potentially block their path to the left side\n5. RIGHT to (1,7) is also safe but puts me in a more open space where enemy could potentially flank\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 9: Go UP to (0,8) - claim the top-left corner\nTurn 10: From (0,8) \u2192 Continue RIGHT to (1,8) to cut off their leftward escape\nTurn 11: Keep pressuring them into the top-right corner until they crash!\nWe need to dominate the left wall and force them into a dead-end!\n\n**THE PLAY:** UP to (0,8) to control the corner and set up the trap! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

No immediate head-on risk this turn, so we press toward the center and set up longer-term traps rather than a reckless chase.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\n- Turn 9: eat (4,8) and grow to length 7, gaining advantage in apples.\n- After that, navigate a two-way pressure line toward (4,9)/(5,9) while maintaining safe exits, inching toward central apples (6,9) and (6,6) to keep growth rate high.\n- Look for clean head-ons only when you have a clear numerical edge or can force him into a cul-de-sac, otherwise keep him boxed by using access points and safe corridors.\n\nLEFT",

It also puts you on the apple-rich top row, pressuring the opponent and narrowing his escape along the upper boundary.\n  - Opponent from (1,7) can go to (2,7) or (1,6); neither is an immediate trap for you if you hold the line on the top row. Your longer length soon will help you box him in the upper-left.\n\n- SHORT-TERM PLAN:\n  - Move LEFT to (2,9) this turn, eat the apple, and extend your lead.\n  - On subsequent turns, use the top corridor to pressure and gradually seal off the enemy path while watching for potential head-on gambits only when you have a clear favorable angle.\n\n- LONG-TERM STRATEGY:\n  - Build a wall along the top row toward the left to restrict enemy movement.\n  - Force a misstep or a corner trap, then trade heads when you have the advantage and the board edges pin him in.\n\nChosen move:\nLEFT\n\nleft",

No apple on (1,9) this turn, but (6,9) and other apples are lurking elsewhere. If we go DOWN, we risk a high-variance head-on with the rival; going LEFT keeps a clean top-row corridor and starts laying a wall toward the left edge, making it harder for him to slip around us. Given the goal to box him in and pressure safely, LEFT is stable and tempo-sensible. We can pivot to a top-wall strategy next turns, and if he coughs up a corner, we can drive for a head-on trade when favorable.\n\nLong-term plan notes:\n- Build a wall along the top row (moving LEFT then potentially LEFT again) to constrain his options toward the left edge.\n- Maintain pressure rather than chase apples aggressively away from the enemy footprint; use the top corridor to limit his mobility.\n- Look for safe head-on opportunities only if they come with a clear apples advantage or guaranteed mutual destruction with you still ahead on apples.\n- Avoid hard dead-ends and keep escape routes open to survive turn after turn.\n\nChosen move:\nLEFT\nLEFT",
