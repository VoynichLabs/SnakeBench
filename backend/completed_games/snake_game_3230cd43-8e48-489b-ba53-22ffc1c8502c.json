The apples are located at (4, 9), (7, 1), (3, 9), (0, 5), and (6, 6). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the positions of the enemy snakes. Snake #1 is at (6, 8), and it doesn't have a body, so it's just a head. I should avoid getting too close to it or moving in a way that could lead to a collision.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one to me is at (0, 5), which is to the left and slightly down. The next closest is at (3, 9), which is to the right and up. The apple at (6, 6) is to the right and slightly down, but it's also close to the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that I don't have a body yet, I have some flexibility in movement. I should aim for the apple that is both close and doesn't put me at risk of colliding with the enemy snake.\n\nMoving towards (0, 5) seems like a good option because it's close and doesn't put me in the path of the enemy snake. To get there, I would need to move left and then down.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves:\n- LEFT: (0, 6)\n- RIGHT: (2, 6)\n- UP: (1, 7)\n- DOWN: (1, 5)\n\nMoving LEFT would take me to (0, 6), which is close to the apple at (0, 5). From there, I could move DOWN to (0, 5) and eat the apple.\n\nMoving DOWN directly would take me to (1, 5), which is not as close to the apple at (0, 5) as moving LEFT first.\n\nMoving RIGHT or UP doesn't seem beneficial right now because it would take me further away from the nearest apple and closer to the enemy snake.\n\nSo, the best move seems to be LEFT to get closer to the apple at (0, 5).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating the apple at (0, 5), I should look for the next closest apple that is safe to reach.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT",
