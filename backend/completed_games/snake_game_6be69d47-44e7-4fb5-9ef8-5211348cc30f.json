Actually, Manhattan distance from (4,1) to (3,3) is |4-3| + |1-3| = 1+2=3, so we can\u2019t meet in one move.  \n\nSo all four moves are safe from head-on.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nClosest apple is at (2, 2) \u2013 Manhattan distance 2 from my head (4,1): |4-2| + |1-2| = 2+1=3? Wait, recalc: |4-2|=2, |1-2|=1, total 3.  \n\nFrom (4,1):  \n- UP to (4,2) \u2192 distance to (2,2) = 2+0=2.  \n- LEFT to (3,1) \u2192 distance to (2,2) = 1+1=2.  \n- DOWN to (4,0) \u2192 distance to (2,2) = 2+2=4.  \n- RIGHT to (5,1) \u2192 distance to (2,2) = 3+1=4.  \n\nSo UP or LEFT reduces distance to nearest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safe moves after each option:**  \n\nIf I go UP to (4,2):  \nNext turn possible moves from (4,2): UP (4,3), DOWN (4,1), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2). All likely safe unless enemy moves into them.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,1):  \nNext turn possible moves from (3,1): UP (3,2), DOWN (3,0), LEFT (2,1), RIGHT (4,1). Also fine.  \n\nBoth keep options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \n\nEnemy at (3,3) might go for apple at (2,2) (distance 2) or (7,3) (distance 4) or (9,3) (distance 6). Closest is (2,2) \u2013 to get there in 2 moves, they could go LEFT to (2,3) then DOWN to (2,2). So maybe they go LEFT this turn.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (2,3), then if I go UP to (4,2) I\u2019m safe. If I go LEFT to (3,1) I\u2019m safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \n\nI want to grow safely. Apple at (2,2) is contested (enemy might aim for it). Maybe I should go for a less contested apple first? Apple at (7,0) is far, (1,8) far, (9,3) far, (7,3) far.  \n\nBut early game, getting first apple gives length advantage. Let\u2019s go for (2,2) but not rush into enemy.  \n\nFrom (4,1), UP to (4,2) puts me closer to (2,2) and also closer to other apples like (7,3) later, while keeping distance from enemy at (3,3).  \n\nLEFT to (3,1) also closer to (2,2) but then next move UP to (3,2) might meet enemy if they go DOWN to (3,2) same turn (head-on). That\u2019s risky next turn.  \n\nSo UP seems better for avoiding possible head-on next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,2), assess if enemy moved toward (2,2). If yes, maybe go for (7,3) or (7,0) instead to avoid collision. Keep growing safely.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\n- Your snake (ID 1) is at (3,3) with no body (just the head). So you are length 1.\n- There is one enemy snake (ID 0) at (4,1) with no body (also length 1).\n- Apples are at (9,3), (1,8), (7,3), (7,0), (2,2).\n\nSince you have no body, the only immediate death risks are:\n1. Moving off the board.\n2. Moving into the enemy snake's head (if it moves into the same cell) or body (but it has no body yet).\n3. Moving into a wall or into the enemy's head? Actually, since both snakes are length 1, there are no body segments to collide with yet.\n\nImportant: The enemy snake is at (4,1). Your head is at (3,3). So you are not adjacent to the enemy.\n\nNow, let's check each direction from (3,3):\n\n- UP: (3,4) - within board? Yes (y=4 is valid). Is there any snake there? No. Safe.\n- DOWN: (3,2) - valid. No snake. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,3) - valid. There is an apple at (2,2) but not at (2,3). No snake. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,3) - valid. No snake. But note: enemy is at (4,1) which is two steps down. So no immediate collision.\n\nAll four moves are safe because:\n- No body segments to hit (yours or enemy's).\n- All are within board.\n\nNow, which direction is best?\nWe want to move towards apples and avoid future traps.\n\nApples:\n- (9,3) is far right.\n- (1,8) is far left and up.\n- (7,3) is right.\n- (7,0) is right and down.\n- (2,2) is left and down.\n\nSo there are apples both left and right.\n\nSince you are at (3,3), the closest apples are:\n- (2,2) is one step down and left (Manhattan distance 2).\n- (7,3) is 4 steps right.\n- (9,3) is 6 steps right.\n- (1,8) is 5 steps left and 5 up.\n- (7,0) is 4 steps right and 3 down.\n\nSo (2,2) is very close. Moving LEFT or DOWN gets you closer to (2,2).\n\nAlso, consider the enemy at (4,1). It might move towards apples too. The closest apple to it is (2,2) as well? Actually (2,2) is at distance |4-2|+|1-2|=2+1=3. Also (7,0) is |4-7|+|1-0|=3+1=4. So it might go left/up or right/down.\n\nBut since you are both length 1, there is no immediate threat.\n\nTo get to (2,2), you need to go LEFT and DOWN. So either LEFT or DOWN is good.\n\nAlso, moving towards the center is generally safe to avoid walls.\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n- UP: (3,4) - moves away from (2,2) but towards (1,8) eventually. But that is far.\n- DOWN: (3,2) - closer to (2,2) (now distance |3-2|+|2-2|=1).\n- LEFT: (2,3) - closer to (2,2) (distance |2-2|+|3-2|=1).\n- RIGHT: (4,3) - moves away from (2,2).\n\nSo DOWN or LEFT are best for the closest apple.\n\nWhich one? Both are equally good in terms of distance. But consider future moves:\n\nIf you go DOWN to (3,2), then next turn you can go LEFT to (2,2) to eat the apple.\nIf you go LEFT to (2,3), then next turn you can go DOWN to (2,2) to eat the apple.\n\nSo both are equivalent.\n\nBut also consider the enemy: it is at (4,1). If it goes UP to (4,2) and then RIGHT to (5,2)? Or LEFT to (3,1)? It might also target (2,2). So we should be cautious.\n\nActually, if you go LEFT to (2,3), and the enemy goes UP to (4,2) and then LEFT to (3,2)? Not directly conflicting.\n\nBut if you go DOWN to (3,2), and the enemy goes LEFT to (3,1) and then UP to (3,2)? That would be a head-on collision next turn? But we are planning only one move.\n\nFor this turn, both are safe.\n\nTo avoid potential conflict, perhaps we should go LEFT first? Because if we go DOWN to (3,2), and the enemy goes LEFT to (3,1) (which is adjacent to (3,2)), then next turn we might both try to go to (2,2) or (3,2) might be risky.\n\nWhereas if we go LEFT to (2,3), we are farther from the enemy.\n\nSo LEFT might be slightly safer.\n\nAlso, going LEFT keeps you near the left edge, which has fewer options, but since we are going for the apple, it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, we could go RIGHT to (4,3) to go for the apples on the right? But they are farther.\n\nGiven that (2,2) is very close, it is better to get it quickly.\n\nSo I think LEFT or DOWN are both good.\n\nI'll choose LEFT to (2,3), which is safe and gets us closer to the apple.\n\nPlan for next turn: from (2,3), we can go DOWN to (2,2) to eat the apple. But we should check if that is safe next turn.\n\nRationale for future: Target the closest apple at (2,2). After eating, we grow to length 2. Then we can move away from the enemy towards other apples.\n\nFinal move: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

No other segments. So no risk of moving into enemy body unless I move into (2, 3) directly, which I can\u2019t from (4, 2) in one move.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \n\nEnemy at (2, 3) can move:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 4)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 2)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 3)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 3)  \n\nMy possible moves:  \n- UP (4, 3) \u2013 enemy could go RIGHT to (3, 3) \u2192 no collision.  \n- DOWN (4, 1) \u2013 enemy could go DOWN to (2, 2) \u2192 no collision.  \n- LEFT (3, 2) \u2013 enemy could go DOWN to (2, 2) \u2192 no collision.  \n- RIGHT (5, 2) \u2013 enemy could go DOWN to (2, 2) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nNo possible head-on this turn because Manhattan distance from (4, 2) to (2, 3) is 3, so we can\u2019t meet in one move.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting and future safety:**  \n\nClosest apple is (2, 2) \u2013 distance from (4, 2) = |4-2| + |2-2| = 2.  \n\nFrom (4, 2):  \n- UP (4, 3) \u2192 distance to (2, 2) = 3.  \n- DOWN (4, 1) \u2192 distance = 3.  \n- LEFT (3, 2) \u2192 distance = 1.  \n- RIGHT (5, 2) \u2192 distance = 3.  \n\nSo LEFT gets me closest to (2, 2).  \n\nBut enemy at (2, 3) is also 1 step away from (2, 2) (DOWN). If I go LEFT to (3, 2), enemy could go DOWN to (2, 2) this turn, eating it before I get there. That\u2019s fine\u2014I don\u2019t die, but I don\u2019t get apple.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (2, 2), then next turn enemy head at (2, 2), body at (2, 3). If I\u2019m at (3, 2), then moving LEFT to (2, 2) would be into enemy head (head-on) if enemy stays still, or if enemy moves away, I could eat apple if it respawns? No, apple disappears when eaten, new apples spawn later maybe. Actually, rules don\u2019t specify apple respawn? It says multi-apple Snake game\u2014likely apples are static until eaten, then new ones spawn. So if enemy eats (2, 2) this turn, it\u2019s gone.  \n\nSo going LEFT doesn\u2019t guarantee apple, but puts me closer to where apple was, maybe not useful.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \n\nEnemy\u2019s closest apple is (2, 2) (distance 1). They will very likely go DOWN to (2, 2) to eat it.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (2, 2), then from (3, 2) (if I go LEFT), next turn I\u2019m adjacent to enemy head. That\u2019s risky for head-on next turn.  \n\nBetter to avoid being adjacent to enemy next turn if possible.  \n\nIf I go UP to (4, 3):  \nEnemy at (2, 2) next turn \u2192 distance from me = 4, safe.  \nAlso, apple at (7, 3) is 3 steps away horizontally, could aim for that.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 2):  \nEnemy at (2, 2) \u2192 distance 3, safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future options:**  \n\nGoing UP (4, 3) gives me access to top apples later (1, 8) and right-side apples (7, 3), (9, 3).  \n\nGoing RIGHT (5, 2) also fine, but maybe less central.  \n\nLEFT (3, 2) risks adjacency to enemy next turn.  \nDOWN (4, 1) moves away from most apples except (7, 0).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nI want to grow safely. Let enemy have (2, 2) for now, avoid early confrontation.  \n\nUP seems safe this turn and keeps distance from enemy next turn, while moving toward other apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 3), check if enemy ate (2, 2) and where they are. Possibly aim for (7, 3) or (9, 3), staying clear of enemy. Keep space to maneuver.  \n\nUP",

Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe.\n\nNow, which is best?\nThe closest apple is at (2,2) directly below you. Moving DOWN will eat it immediately. This gives you +1 apple and grows your length to 2.\n\nBenefits of eating the apple:\n- Gain a point.\n- Grow longer, which provides more body to protect against enemy head collisions (if enemy hits your body, they die).\n- You become longer than the enemy (they are still length 1).\n\nRisks of moving DOWN to (2,2):\n- The enemy might also be targeting (2,2). But as calculated, it is at (4,2). To reach (2,2) in one move, it would need to move LEFT twice? But moves are simultaneous. So this turn, the enemy can only move one step. Possible moves for enemy from (4,2):\n  - UP: (4,3)\n  - DOWN: (4,1)\n  - LEFT: (3,2)\n  - RIGHT: (5,2)\nNone of these is (2,2). So the enemy cannot reach (2,2) this turn. Therefore, moving DOWN is safe and you will get the apple without competition.\n\nOther moves:\n- UP: moves away from the apple.\n- LEFT: moves away from the apple.\n- RIGHT: moves away from the apple.\n\nSo DOWN is clearly the best to get the apple immediately.\n\nAfter eating, you will be at (2,2) with length 2 (head at (2,2), tail at (2,3)). Then next turn, you can move away from the tail to avoid trapping yourself.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (2,2), consider moving towards other apples. The next closest might be (1,8) or (7,3). But since the enemy is at (4,2), you might want to avoid direct confrontation. With length 2, you have an advantage: if the enemy hits your body, they die. So you can be more aggressive.\n\nBut for now, prioritize eating the apple.\n\nFinal move: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

So length 2.\n- Enemy snake (ID 0) is at (4,3) with no body (length 1).\n- Apples at: (9,3), (1,8), (7,3), (7,0), (5,1). Note: the apple at (2,2) was just eaten by you last turn (so it's gone now).\n\nLast turn you moved DOWN from (2,3) to (2,2) and ate the apple. Now your head is at (2,2) and your tail is at (2,3).\n\nCheck each direction from (2,2):\n- UP: (2,3) - within board? Yes. But this is your own tail. Moving into your own body is fatal. So UP is unsafe.\n- DOWN: (2,1) - within board? Yes. No snake there (enemy is at (4,3)). Safe.\n- LEFT: (1,2) - within board? Yes. No snake. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,2) - within board? Yes. No snake. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\nThe closest apples are at (5,1) and (7,3). (5,1) is at distance |5-2|+|1-2|=3+1=4, and (7,3) is |7-2|+|3-2|=5+1=6. So (5,1) is closer.\n\nTo reach (5,1), moving RIGHT (to (3,2)) or DOWN (to (2,1)) are both steps in the right direction. However, moving RIGHT gets you closer to both (5,1) and (7,3) than moving DOWN.\n\nAlso consider the enemy at (4,3). It might be heading towards apples too. From (4,3), it can move to (4,4), (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3). It might target (7,3) or (5,1). We should avoid head-on collisions.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (3,2), the enemy might move DOWN to (4,2) or LEFT to (3,3). There is no direct conflict this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, we should aim for (5,1) or (1,8). Since (1,8) is far, (5,1) is preferable. Also, with length 2, we have a slight advantage over the enemy (length 1). If we collide head-on with the enemy, both die. So we should avoid moving to the same cell as the enemy.\n\nPossible moves:\n- DOWN: (2,1) - moves towards (5,1) but not as directly.\n- LEFT: (1,2) - moves away from the closest apples.\n- RIGHT: (3,2) - moves towards (5,1) and (7,3).\n\nRIGHT seems best to progress towards the apples.\n\nAlso, note that after moving RIGHT, your head will be at (3,2) and tail at (2,2). This leaves your tail behind, so you have more flexibility next turn.\n\nNext turn, from (3,2), you can move UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), RIGHT to (4,2), or LEFT to (2,2) (but that would be backwards into your tail? Actually, your tail will be at (2,2) only if you don't grow. Since you didn't eat an apple this turn, you won't grow, so your tail will move to (2,2) after you move. So next turn, your body will be [(3,2), (2,2)]? Wait, let's clarify:\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,2):\n- Your head moves to (3,2).\n- Since no apple was eaten, your tail moves: the tail (which was at (2,3)) moves to the next segment? Actually, for a snake of length 2, when you move without eating, the tail moves to the previous head position? Actually, the entire body shifts: the head moves to (3,2), and the body segment (which was at (2,3)) moves to the old head position (2,2). So your new snake will be: head at (3,2), body at (2,2).\n\nSo next turn, from (3,2), moving LEFT to (2,2) would be into your own body (which is at (2,2)), so that would be fatal. But other directions are open.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now sets you up with good options.\n\nTherefore, choose RIGHT.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

So length is 2.\n- Enemy snake (ID 0) has head at (5,3) and no body (length 1).\n- Apples at: (9,3), (1,8), (7,3), (7,0), (5,1)\n\nCheck each direction from your head (3,2):\n- UP: (3,3) - within board? Yes. Check for snakes: enemy is at (5,3), which is not (3,3). Your body is at (2,2), so (3,3) is safe. Safe.\n- DOWN: (3,1) - within board? Yes. No snakes there. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,2) - within board? Yes. But this is your own body (current tail). Moving into your own body is fatal. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,2) - within board? Yes. No snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\nThe closest apples are (5,1) and (7,3). (5,1) is at Manhattan distance |5-3| + |1-2| = 2+1=3. (7,3) is |7-3|+|3-2|=4+1=5. So (5,1) is closer.\n\nTo reach (5,1), moving DOWN (to (3,1)) reduces the y-distance (from 2 to 1) and keeps x the same (3). Moving RIGHT (to (4,2)) increases x (closer to 5) but keeps y the same (2). Both are good. UP (to (3,3)) moves away from (5,1) in y-direction.\n\nAlso consider the enemy at (5,3). It might target (5,1) or (7,3). From (5,3), it can move DOWN to (5,2), LEFT to (4,3), RIGHT to (6,3), or UP to (5,4). If it moves DOWN to (5,2), it gets closer to (5,1). We should avoid head-on collisions.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (4,2), we are closer to (5,1) and also to the enemy. The enemy might move DOWN to (5,2), which is adjacent to (4,2). There is no direct collision this turn, but next turn we might both target (5,1) and collide.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (3,1), we are further from the enemy and still progressing towards (5,1). This seems safer.\n\nAlso, note that moving DOWN gives us more options next turn: from (3,1), we can go UP (to (3,2)), but that would be our tail? Actually, after moving without eating, our tail will move to the old head position (3,2)? Wait, let's simulate:\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (3,1):\n- Head moves to (3,1)\n- Since no apple eaten, the tail (which was at (2,2)) moves to the previous head position (3,2). So new body is [(3,1), (3,2)].\nSo next turn, from (3,1), moving UP to (3,2) would be into our own body (which is at (3,2)), so that would be fatal. But other directions (LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (4,1), DOWN to (3,0)) are safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we move RIGHT to (4,2):\n- Head to (4,2), tail to (3,2). New body: [(4,2), (3,2)].\nNext turn, from (4,2), moving LEFT to (3,2) would be fatal (into body). Other directions safe.\n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT have similar future constraints.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (5,3) and might move towards (5,1), moving DOWN to (3,1) keeps us slightly further away and reduces the chance of immediate conflict. Also, (5,1) is at y=1, so moving DOWN gets us to y=1.\n\nTherefore, DOWN seems safer and efficient.\n\nUP is less desirable because it moves away from the closest apple.\n\nSo choose DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan: Aim for (5,1) first, then (7,0) or (7,3). Avoid the enemy (snake 0) as it might become aggressive. With length 2, we have a slight advantage, but head-on collision would kill both. So be cautious.\n\nDOWN",

Moving into your own body is fatal. So UP is unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,0) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy there. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,1) - Within board? Yes. No snakes there. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,1) - Within board? Yes. No snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\nThe closest apple is (5,1) at Manhattan distance |5-3| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2.\nAlso (7,0) is at |7-3|+|0-1|=4+1=5, and (7,3) at |7-3|+|3-1|=4+2=6.\n\nTo reach (5,1), moving RIGHT (to (4,1)) reduces the x-distance (from 3 to 4) and keeps y=1. This is directly towards the apple.\nMoving DOWN (to (3,0)) moves away from (5,1) in y-direction (y=0 vs y=1).\nMoving LEFT (to (2,1)) moves away in x-direction (x=2 vs x=5).\n\nSo RIGHT is clearly the best for reaching (5,1).\n\nConsider the enemy at (6,3). It might target (5,1) or (7,3). From (6,3), it can move DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3) (which is an apple), or UP to (6,4). If it moves LEFT to (5,3), it gets closer to (5,1). But we are at (3,1) and moving to (4,1), which is still safe.\n\nThere is no immediate collision risk: enemy head at (6,3) is not adjacent to (4,1) (Manhattan distance |6-4|+|3-1|=2+2=4). So we are safe.\n\nAlso, after moving RIGHT to (4,1):\n- Head moves to (4,1)\n- Since no apple eaten (yet), the tail moves to the previous head position (3,1). So new body is [(4,1), (3,1)].\nNext turn, from (4,1), we can move RIGHT to (5,1) to eat the apple, or other directions. Moving LEFT to (3,1) would be fatal (into body), but that's normal.\n\nSo RIGHT is optimal.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat (5,1) next turn. Then consider (7,0) or (7,3). Avoid enemy snake #0 as it might grow. With length 2, we have a slight advantage over the enemy (length 1), but head-on collision would kill both. So be cautious when approaching the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy there (enemy at (7,3) and (6,3)). Also not your body (your body is at (3,1)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,0) - Within board? Yes. No snakes there. Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,1) - This is your own body (current tail). Moving into your own body is fatal. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (5,1) - Within board? Yes. There is an apple at (5,1)! So if we move RIGHT, we eat the apple and grow. Also, check for snakes: no enemy there. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\nMoving RIGHT to (5,1) eats the apple. This is highly beneficial: we gain an apple and grow to length 3. Our head moves to (5,1), and we add a new segment at the head (so body becomes [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]). This is clearly the best move.\n\nConsider alternatives:\n- UP (to (4,2)): moves away from the apple at (5,1). Manhattan distance to (5,1) becomes |5-4|+|1-2|=1+1=2 (same as current? Current is |5-4|+|1-1|=1+0=1). Actually moving UP increases distance.\n- DOWN (to (4,0)): also moves away (y=0 vs y=1) so distance to (5,1) becomes |5-4|+|1-0|=1+1=2.\n\nSo RIGHT is directly onto the apple.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7,3) with body at (6,3). It might target the apple at (7,0) or (9,3). From (7,3), it can move DOWN to (7,2) (towards (7,0)), LEFT to (6,3) (its own body, unsafe), RIGHT to (8,3) (safe), or UP to (7,4) (safe). So it is unlikely to come to (5,1) immediately.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), we become length 3. Then we can consider next moves: perhaps towards (7,0) or (7,3) (but enemy is near (7,3)) or (1,8) and (1,9). But with length 3, we have more flexibility.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (5,1), we are at (5,1). Next turn, safe moves might be UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT would be into body at (4,1)). We should avoid the enemy at (7,3) and consider going towards (7,0) or (1,8). But we'll reassess next turn.\n\nRIGHT is optimal.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,1) - This is your own body (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (6,1) - Within board? Yes. No snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\nApples are at (9,3), (1,8), (7,0), (1,9), (1,4). The closest apple is (1,4) at Manhattan distance |5-1|+|1-4|=4+3=7. Also (7,0) is at |5-7|+|1-0|=2+1=3.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,1) gets us closer to (7,0): distance becomes |6-7|+|1-0|=1+1=2.\nMoving DOWN to (5,0) is even closer to (7,0): |5-7|+|0-0|=2+0=2 (same as current? Current is |5-7|+|1-0|=2+1=3). Actually moving DOWN reduces distance to (7,0) from 3 to 2.\nMoving UP to (5,2) increases distance to (7,0) to |5-7|+|2-0|=2+2=4.\n\nAlso consider (1,4): moving LEFT would be best but LEFT is unsafe. So we cannot go directly towards (1,4). Instead, we can go DOWN or RIGHT to eventually loop around.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,3) with body at (7,3). It might target the apple at (9,3) (very close) or (7,0). From (8,3), it can move LEFT to (7,3) (its own body, unsafe), RIGHT to (9,3) (to eat the apple), DOWN to (8,2) (safe), or UP to (8,4) (safe). So it will likely go RIGHT to (9,3) to eat the apple. This means it will grow to length 3 and its head will be at (9,3) next turn.\n\nWe should avoid the enemy if possible. After this turn, if we go RIGHT to (6,1), we are closer to (7,0). The enemy might also go for (7,0) after eating (9,3)? But (7,0) is far from (9,3). Alternatively, we can go DOWN to (5,0) which is also close to (7,0).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are good. However, going DOWN to (5,0) might be slightly better because:\n- It reduces distance to (7,0) to 2 (same as RIGHT to (6,1)).\n- It also opens up future moves: from (5,0), we can go RIGHT to (6,0) (towards (7,0)) or UP to (5,1) (but that is our body next turn? Actually after moving, our body will be [(5,0), (5,1), (4,1)] so (5,1) is occupied). So from (5,0), safe moves would be RIGHT and LEFT? LEFT is (4,0) which is free. So we have two options: RIGHT and LEFT.\nFrom (6,1), safe moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT? (LEFT would be (5,1) which is body). So also two options.\n\nBut DOWN might be safer because it moves away from the enemy at (8,3) which is going to (9,3). Also, (7,0) is an apple that the enemy might not target immediately.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, we should aim for (7,0) and then perhaps (1,4) or (1,8). Avoid the enemy snake which is likely to be near the top right.\n\nI choose DOWN to get closer to (7,0) and avoid the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let's assess the situation.  \n\n**Step 1 \u2013 My current position and safe moves**  \nMy head: (8, 3)  \nMy body: [(7, 3)] (tail at (7, 3) now? Wait, last turn I moved from (7,3) to (8,3), so body is now [(8,3), (7,3)]? No \u2014 check: last turn my head was (7,3), body was [(6,3)]. I moved RIGHT to (8,3). So new body is [(8,3), (7,3)]? Actually, after moving without eating apple, my body becomes [new head, old head, old body\u2026 but length stays same unless apple eaten]. I had length 2 before (head + 1 body segment). After moving, head at (8,3), body segments: old head (7,3) and old body (6,3)? No \u2014 length is 2, so body = [(7,3)] only. Yes: snake length = apples collected + 2. I have 1 apple, so length = 3? Wait, apples collected = 1, so length = 3 (head + 2 body segments). Let\u2019s verify from board: board shows \u201cT 0 A\u201d at row 3, col 7\u20139: (7,3) is my tail (T), (8,3) is my head (0), (9,3) is apple (A). So my body: head (8,3), then (7,3), then (6,3)? But board shows only one T at (7,3). That means my tail is at (7,3), so length = 2? That contradicts apples collected = 1 (should be length 3). Hmm \u2014 maybe board notation \u201cT\u201d means tail, but my tail is at (6,3) actually? Let\u2019s check last turn: my body was [(6,3)], head (7,3). I moved RIGHT to (8,3), didn\u2019t eat apple. So new body = [(7,3), (6,3)]? That\u2019s length 3 total (head + 2 body segments). So tail is at (6,3). But board shows T at (7,3). That means board might show \u201cT\u201d for any body segment except head? Possibly \u201cT\u201d means body segment (not necessarily tail). Yes, that makes sense: board shows \u201cT\u201d at (7,3) because it\u2019s my body, not necessarily tail. So my actual tail is at (6,3) off-screen? Wait, row 3: (6,3) is empty on board. So maybe my tail is at (6,3) but board didn\u2019t show it because it\u2019s off the visible part? No, board is 10x10, (6,3) is within 0\u20139. Let\u2019s check board again:  \n\nRow 3: \". . . . . . . T 0 A\" \u2192 columns 0\u20139: col 6 is \".\", col 7 is \"T\", col 8 is \"0\", col 9 is \"A\". So my body segment at (7,3), head at (8,3). That means my length is 2 (head + 1 body). But I have 1 apple collected, so length should be 3. Contradiction unless apples collected count starts after initial length? Maybe initial length is 2 with 0 apples, so 1 apple \u2192 length 3. But board shows only 2 segments. Possibly the board only shows head and immediate body segment, not tail? But enemy snake #1 shows \"T T 1\" at (3,1),(4,1),(5,1) \u2014 that\u2019s 3 segments. So maybe my tail is at (6,3) but board shows \".\" by mistake? Let\u2019s trust coordinates given: \"Body: [(7,3)]\" from game text. So length = 2 total. That means apples collected = 1 but length didn\u2019t grow yet? Maybe growth happens next turn after eating? No, in Snake you grow after eating, so if I ate apple last turn, I\u2019d be length 3 now. I didn\u2019t eat apple last turn, so length still 2. So apples collected = 1 from earlier turn. Yes, that fits: I ate an apple before last turn, so last turn I was length 3, but after moving without eating, length stays 3. But body list shows only [(7,3)]? That\u2019s wrong unless they only list body segments excluding head and tail? No, they say \"Body: [(7,3)]\" means only one body segment, so total length = head + 1 body = 2. So maybe apples collected = 1 but initial length is 1? That\u2019s weird. Let\u2019s assume game\u2019s given body list is all segments after head: so if body = [(7,3)], total snake = head (8,3) + (7,3) = length 2. So I have 1 apple but length 2 \u2014 means growth is delayed until end of turn after movement? Possibly.  \n\nAnyway, safe moves from (8,3):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,4) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,2) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,3) \u2013 my body, unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,3) \u2013 apple.  \n\nSo safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy snake #1**  \nHead: (5,1), body: [(4,1), (3,1)]  \nFrom (5,1), possible moves:  \nUP (5,2), DOWN (5,0), LEFT (4,1) body, RIGHT (6,1) empty.  \nEnemy might go for apple at (7,0) or (1,4) etc., but not near me.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (9,3), (1,8), (7,0), (1,9), (1,4)  \nClosest to me: (9,3) in RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9,3), enemy can\u2019t reach it this turn (enemy at (5,1)). No other snakes. So safe.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \nRIGHT to (9,3): eat apple, grow to length 3 next turn. Next turn head at (9,3), body will be [(9,3), (8,3), (7,3)]? Actually after eating, new segment adds at tail after move, so body = [(8,3), (7,3)] plus new tail? Wait, growth means next turn my length increases, so from (9,3) my possible moves: UP (9,4), DOWN (9,2), LEFT (8,3) body \u2014 so only 2 safe moves unless I eat another apple. But board edges: at x=9, only LEFT is not edge, UP/DOWN are safe unless blocked.  \n\nUP to (8,4): keeps apple (9,3) nearby for next turn, more options.  \nDOWN to (8,2): moves away from apple.  \n\nBest is RIGHT to eat apple now, gain point, grow.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT gets apple, increases score to 2, still safe this turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,3), avoid moving into own body (LEFT into (8,3)), so only UP/DOWN safe unless growth changes body positions. Actually after eating, tail stays same until next move? In Snake, new segment appears at tail next turn, so immediate next turn body length is old length +1, so (8,3) and (7,3) are body, so LEFT into (8,3) is still body. So from (9,3) only UP/DOWN safe. That\u2019s risky if both UP/DOWN are dangerous next turn (enemy, walls). But enemy far away, so should be fine.  \n\nI\u2019ll go RIGHT.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait, movement without eating: head to (9,4), body becomes old head (9,3) and old first body segment (8,3). So (9,3) will be body next turn. So from (9,4), DOWN to (9,3) is unsafe. So safe moves: UP (9,5), LEFT (8,4). That\u2019s only 2 safe moves, but not a dead end yet.\n\nFrom (9,2) next turn:  \nBody: [(9,2), (9,3), (8,3)] \u2192 so (9,3) is body.  \nFrom (9,2): UP (9,3) unsafe, DOWN (9,1) safe, LEFT (8,2) safe, RIGHT off board.

If I go DOWN to (9,2), I\u2019m still far from (7,0) next turn, so enemy likely gets it.  \n\nBut more important: staying alive. Both moves safe this turn.  \n\nI think UP is slightly better because it keeps me away from enemy\u2019s possible path toward (7,0) and leaves more room to maneuver along top edge later.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,4), likely move LEFT to (8,4) to open more options and avoid top edge trap.

Moving into your own body is fatal. So UP is unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,-1) - This is off the board (y=-1). So DOWN is unsafe.\n- LEFT: (4,0) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy there (enemy at (9,3), (8,3), (7,3)). Not your body (your body is at (5,1) and (4,1)). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,0) - Within board? Yes. No snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\nApples are at (1,8), (7,0), (1,9), (1,4), (2,6). The closest apple is (7,0) at Manhattan distance |5-7|+|0-0|=2+0=2. Also (2,6) is at |5-2|+|0-6|=3+6=9, and (1,4) at |5-1|+|0-4|=4+4=8.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,0) gets us closer to (7,0): distance becomes |6-7|+|0-0|=1+0=1.\nMoving LEFT to (4,0) increases distance to (7,0) to |4-7|+|0-0|=3+0=3.\n\nSo RIGHT is clearly better for reaching (7,0).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (9,3) with body at [(8,3), (7,3)]. It might target the apple at (1,8) or (1,9) or (1,4) but those are far. Alternatively, it might go for (2,6). From (9,3), it can move LEFT to (8,3) (its own body, unsafe), RIGHT (off board), DOWN to (9,2) (safe), or UP to (9,4) (safe). So it will likely go DOWN or UP. It is not a direct threat to us at (5,0).\n\nWe should prioritize eating (7,0) as it is very close. Moving RIGHT to (6,0) puts us one step away. Next turn, we can move RIGHT again to (7,0) to eat the apple (unless the enemy interferes, but it is far).\n\nAlso, from (6,0), we can consider future moves: after eating (7,0), we grow to length 4. Then we can plan to go towards other apples like (1,4) or (2,6). But first, secure the closest apple.\n\nLEFT to (4,0) moves us away from (7,0) and towards the left side where there are apples (1,4) and (1,8), but it is slower. Also, from (4,0), we have options: UP to (4,1) is our body (unsafe), RIGHT to (5,0) is our current head (will be body next turn), DOWN off board. So only LEFT to (3,0) would be safe? That might lead to a dead end. So LEFT is less flexible.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (7,0), we will be at (7,0) with length 4. Then we can consider moving UP to (7,1) or LEFT to (6,0) (but that will be body) or RIGHT to (8,0) (safe) or DOWN off board. So UP or RIGHT. We should then aim for (2,6) or (1,4) by going leftwards.

Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,0) - This is your own body (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,0) - Within board? Yes. There is an apple at (7,0)! Moving here will eat the apple and grow. Check for snakes: no enemy snake body at (7,0) (enemy is at (9,4), (9,3), (8,3)). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0) immediately eats the apple. This is highly beneficial: we grow to length 4 and gain an apple (total 3). This also removes the apple from the board.\n\nMoving UP to (6,1) does not eat an apple immediately. The closest apples are (7,0) (distance |6-7|+|0-0|=1) and (2,6) (|6-2|+|0-6|=4+6=10). After moving UP to (6,1), we are at distance |6-7|+|1-0|=1+1=2 from (7,0) and |6-2|+|1-6|=4+5=9 from (2,6). So we are farther from (7,0) and not closer to others.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (9,4). It might move towards apples on the left (like (1,8), (1,9), (1,4)) or (2,6). From (9,4), it can move LEFT to (8,4) (safe), DOWN to (9,3) (its own body, unsafe), RIGHT (off board), UP to (9,5) (safe). So it will likely go LEFT or UP. It is not a direct threat to us at (6,0).\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to eat the apple at (7,0). This is safe and immediately rewarding.\n\nAfter eating (7,0), we will be at (7,0) with length 4. Our body will be [(6,0), (5,0), (5,1)]. Next turn, from (7,0), we can consider moves: UP to (7,1), LEFT to (6,0) (which will be our body, unsafe), RIGHT to (8,0) (safe), DOWN off board. So only UP and RIGHT are safe. We should plan to go UP to (7,1) to avoid dead-end and then towards other apples like (2,6) or (1,4). Alternatively, RIGHT to (8,0) is safe but might lead to fewer options later.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (7,0), move UP to (7,1) to open more options. Then consider moving leftwards towards the cluster of apples at (1,4), (1,8), (1,9) and (2,6). Avoid the enemy which is in the top right.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\nMoving RIGHT to (8,0) does not eat an apple. The closest apples are (1,2), (1,4), (2,6), (1,8), (1,9). From (8,0), the Manhattan distances: to (1,2)=|8-1|+|0-2|=7+2=9; to (1,4)=7+4=11; to (2,6)=6+6=12; to (1,8)=7+8=15; to (1,9)=7+9=16.\nMoving UP to (7,1) also doesn't eat an apple. Distances: to (1,2)=|7-1|+|1-2|=6+1=7; to (1,4)=6+3=9; to (2,6)=5+5=10; to (1,8)=6+7=13; to (1,9)=6+8=14.\nSo UP is closer to multiple apples (especially (1,2) and (1,4)).\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\n- From (8,0): safe moves would be UP (8,1) and RIGHT (9,0) (if no enemy) and possibly LEFT (7,0) but that might be body? Actually, after moving RIGHT, our body becomes [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1)] so (7,0) is body next turn. So from (8,0), only UP and RIGHT are safe? LEFT to (7,0) is body. So only two moves.\n- From (7,1): safe moves would be UP (7,2), LEFT (6,1), RIGHT (8,1). All three are safe? Check: (6,1) is not body (body is at (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1)), so yes. So UP gives more options.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,4). It might move towards apples on the left. It can move LEFT to (7,4), DOWN to (8,3) (but (8,3) is not its body? Its body is [(9,4), (9,3)] so (8,3) is safe), UP to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,4) (which is its body, unsafe). So likely LEFT, DOWN, or UP. It is not an immediate threat to us at (7,0).\n\nTherefore, UP is better because it opens more options (three moves next turn) and gets us closer to the cluster of apples on the left (especially (1,2) and (1,4)). Moving RIGHT to (8,0) leads to a corner with fewer options.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP to (7,1), next turn we can go LEFT to (6,1) and then continue leftwards towards the apples at (1,2) and (1,4). Avoid moving too far right to prevent getting trapped. The enemy is in the top right, so moving left is safe.\n\nUP",

Our body is [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0)] so (6,0) is body, unsafe). So only UP and LEFT are safe? Actually, check: DOWN (6,0) is body, so unsafe. RIGHT (7,1) is previous head? But after moving LEFT, our body becomes [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)] so (7,1) is body next turn. So from (6,1), safe moves: UP (6,2) and LEFT (5,1). Two options.\n- From (7,2): safe moves would be UP (7,3), LEFT (6,2), RIGHT (8,2). All three should be safe? Check: our body will be [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)] so none of these are body. So three options.\n- From (8,1): safe moves would be UP (8,2), LEFT (7,1) (which becomes body), RIGHT (9,1). So only UP and RIGHT.\n\nSo UP (to (7,2)) gives the most options (three moves next turn), while LEFT (to (6,1)) gives two and RIGHT (to (8,1)) gives two. However, LEFT is more directly towards the apples.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to collect apples on the left. Moving LEFT now gets us closer. But we must avoid getting trapped. From (6,1), we can go LEFT to (5,1) and then continue leftwards. The enemy is at (7,4) and might move left, so we should be cautious. Moving UP to (7,2) is also good as it keeps us flexible and we can then go LEFT to (6,2) next turn.\n\nGiven that we have three safe moves, we should choose the one that progresses towards apples while maintaining safety. LEFT is best for progress, but UP is better for flexibility. Since the enemy is not too close, LEFT is acceptable.\n\nAlso, note that the apple at (1,2) is very close. We can reach it in a few moves: e.g., LEFT to (6,1), then LEFT to (5,1), then LEFT to (4,1), then DOWN to (4,0)? Actually, (1,2) is at y=2, so we need to go up eventually. Alternatively, from (6,1) we can go UP to (6,2) and then left.\n\nI think LEFT is the best choice to start moving towards the apples.\n\nLEFT\n**NEXT TURN PLAN: After moving LEFT to (6,1), next turn we should consider going LEFT to (5,1) or UP to (6,2) to avoid the body at (6,0). Continue moving leftwards towards the apples at (1,2) and (1,4). Be aware of enemy snake #0 which might be moving down/left.**\nLEFT",

Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there (enemy head at (6,4), body at (7,4), (8,4)). Not your body (your body is at (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)).

Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there. But your body is at (7,1) (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow, which is best?\nThe apples are clustered on the left: (1,2), (1,4), (1,8), (1,9) and (2,6). Moving LEFT (to (5,1)) gets us closer to these apples. For example:\n- From (5,1): Manhattan to (1,2)=|5-1|+|1-2|=4+1=5; to (1,4)=4+3=7; to (2,6)=3+5=8.\n- From (6,2): to (1,2)=5+0=5; to (1,4)=5+2=7; to (2,6)=4+4=8.\n\nBoth moves have similar Manhattan distances to the apples. However, moving LEFT (to (5,1)) is more directly towards the left side where most apples are.\n\nNow, consider future moves:\n- From (5,1): safe moves next turn? After moving LEFT, our body becomes [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]. So:\n  - UP: (5,2) - safe? Not body, not enemy (enemy at (6,4) etc.).\n  - DOWN: (5,0) - safe? Not body, not enemy.\n  - LEFT: (4,1) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (6,1) - but (6,1) becomes body next turn? Actually, after moving LEFT, the head is at (5,1) and the body segments are [ (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0) ]. So (6,1) is the first body segment, so moving RIGHT into (6,1) would be fatal. So safe moves from (5,1) would be UP, DOWN, LEFT. Three options.\n- From (6,2): safe moves next turn? Body becomes [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)].\n  - UP: (6,3) - safe.\n  - DOWN: (6,1) - but (6,1) is body, unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (5,2) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (7,2) - safe? Not body, not enemy.\n  So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Three options.\n\nBoth moves give three safe options next turn. However, moving LEFT (to (5,1)) gets us one step closer to the apples and also avoids the enemy snake #0 which is at (6,4). The enemy might move down or left, but we are not in immediate danger.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to collect the apples on the left. Moving LEFT now to (5,1) is beneficial. Then we can continue leftwards to (4,1), (3,1), etc., and then go up to reach (1,2) or (1,4). Alternatively, from (5,1) we can go UP to (5,2) and then left to (4,2), etc.\n\nGiven that both moves are safe and offer similar future options, but LEFT progresses more directly towards the goal, we choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT\n**NEXT TURN PLAN: After moving LEFT to (5,1), next turn we can go LEFT to (4,1), UP to (5,2), or DOWN to (5,0). Prefer LEFT to continue towards the apples at (1,2) and (1,4). Be cautious of enemy snake #0 which might move down.**\nLEFT",

Apples collected: 3.\nApples at: (1,8), (1,9), (1,4), (2,6), (1,2)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (2,4) and body at [(3,4), (4,4)] (length 3).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (2,1):\n- UP: (2,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there (enemy head at (2,4), body at (3,4), (4,4)). Not your body (your body is at (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,0) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there. Not your body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (1,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there. Not your body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there. But your body is at (3,1) (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, which is best?\nThe apples are clustered on the left: (1,2), (1,4), (1,8), (1,9) and (2,6). Moving LEFT (to (1,1)) gets us closer to these apples. For example:\n- From (1,1): Manhattan to (1,2)=0+1=1; to (1,4)=0+3=3; to (2,6)=1+5=6.\n- From (2,2): to (1,2)=1+0=1; to (1,4)=1+2=3; to (2,6)=0+4=4.\n- From (2,0): to (1,2)=1+2=3; to (1,4)=1+4=5; to (2,6)=0+6=6.\n\nLEFT and UP have similar distances to the nearest apples (e.g., (1,2)), but LEFT is directly adjacent to (1,2) and we can eat it next turn if we move LEFT now. Also, moving LEFT continues our progress towards the left side.\n\nConsider future moves:\n- After moving LEFT to (1,1), our body becomes [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)].\n  - From (1,1): safe moves next turn? UP (1,2) (apple!), DOWN (1,0), LEFT (0,1). RIGHT (2,1) is body? (2,1) becomes the first body segment, so unsafe. So three safe moves (including eating the apple at (1,2)).\n- After moving UP to (2,2), body becomes [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)].\n  - From (2,2): UP (2,3), DOWN (2,1) (body, unsafe), LEFT (1,2) (apple), RIGHT (3,2). So three safe moves (including eating the apple at (1,2) via LEFT).\n- After moving DOWN to (2,0), body becomes [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)].\n  - From (2,0): UP (2,1) (body, unsafe), DOWN (2,-1) (off board, unsafe), LEFT (1,0), RIGHT (3,0). Only two safe moves? This is worse.\n\nSo DOWN leads to fewer options next turn. Avoid DOWN.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, both allow eating the apple at (1,2) next turn. However, moving LEFT to (1,1) puts us directly below (1,2), so we can go UP to eat it. Moving UP to (2,2) requires going LEFT to (1,2) to eat it. Both are equivalent in steps to the apple.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT also positions us better for other apples on the left (like (1,4)) and avoids the enemy snake #0 which is at (2,4) above us. Moving UP brings us closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, prefer LEFT.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN: After moving LEFT to (1,1), next turn we can go UP to (1,2) to eat the apple, DOWN to (1,0), or LEFT to (0,1). Prefer UP to eat the apple at (1,2). Monitor enemy snake #0 which is at (2,4) and might move down or left.**\nLEFT",

Moving UP to (1,2) is still safe since the enemy is two steps away. We need to be cautious about the enemy moving down, but that is not immediate.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN: After moving UP to (1,2) and eating the apple, we will have head at (1,2) and body [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)].

Apples collected: 4.\nApples at: (1,8), (1,9), (2,6), (3,3), (4,0)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (1,5) and body at [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)] (length 4).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (1,2):\n- UP: (1,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there (enemy head at (1,5), body at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)). Not your body (your body is at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (1,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there. But your body is at (1,1) (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there. Not your body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there. Not your body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- UP: (1,3) - no apple, but safe.\n- LEFT: (0,2) - no apple, but safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,2) - no apple, but safe.\n\nNo immediate apple to eat. We need to plan for future apples and avoid the enemy.\n\nApples available: (1,8), (1,9) above; (2,6) to the right; (3,3) diagonally; (4,0) below.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (1,5) above us. It might move down, left, or right. We should avoid moving directly towards it to prevent head-on collisions.\n\nConsider future moves:\n- Moving UP to (1,3): from there, we can go UP (1,4) (but enemy is at (1,5) and might move down to (1,4)?), LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3). However, (1,4) might be risky if enemy moves down.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,2): from there, we can go UP (0,3), DOWN (0,1), RIGHT (1,2) (but that's our current head, now body? Actually, after moving LEFT, our body becomes [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)]? Wait, head moves to (0,2), so body is [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) ]? Actually, since we ate an apple last turn, we grew to length 5. So when we move, the tail stays? Actually, the tail moves: the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous segment's position, and if we didn't eat, the tail moves away. But we didn't eat this turn, so we don't grow. So after moving, the head goes to new cell, and each body segment shifts: the first body segment becomes the old head, etc., and the tail is removed? Actually, in Snake, when you don't eat, the entire snake moves: head to new, each segment to the previous, and the tail is cut off. So our length remains 5.\n\nSo after moving LEFT to (0,2), our new body becomes [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) ] (head at (0,2), tail at (3,1)).\nFrom (0,2): safe moves? UP (0,3), DOWN (0,1), RIGHT (1,2) (which is now our body? Yes, (1,2) is the first body segment). So only two safe moves: UP and DOWN.\nSimilarly, moving RIGHT to (2,2): new body [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) ].\nFrom (2,2): safe moves? UP (2,3), DOWN (2,1) (body? (2,1) is in the body), LEFT (1,2) (body), RIGHT (3,2). So only two safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\nMoving UP to (1,3): new body [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) ].\nFrom (1,3): safe moves? UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2) (body), LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3). So three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nSo UP gives the most options (3 moves) next turn.\n\nAlso, we want to go towards apples. The apples at (1,8) and (1,9) are above. Moving UP is in that direction. The enemy is at (1,5), so we need to be cautious. But we are at (1,3), and enemy at (1,5): if we move UP to (1,4) next turn, and enemy moves DOWN to (1,4), we have head-on collision. So we should avoid that.\n\nBut for now, moving UP to (1,3) is safe and gives more flexibility.\n\nLEFT and RIGHT lead to edges with fewer options.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to maintain mobility and move towards the apples above.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN: After moving UP to (1,3), we have head at (1,3) and body [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)]. Safe moves: UP (1,4), LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3). Avoid UP if enemy is likely to move down to (1,4) (enemy head at (1,5) can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT). Prefer LEFT or RIGHT to avoid potential head-on. Apples at (1,8) and (1,9) are long-term goals; also (2,6) to the right. Consider moving RIGHT to (2,3) to eventually reach (2,6).**\nUP",

Yes. Check for snakes: enemy body at (2,4) (last segment of snake #0). Moving into enemy body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (2,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there. Not your body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (1,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there. Not your body. Also, there is an apple at (3,3)! Safe and beneficial.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- DOWN: (2,2) - no apple, but safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - has an apple! Eating it would grow your snake and increase your score to 5.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is clearly advantageous as it directly eats an apple.\n\nAlso, consider enemy snake #0 at head (2,6). It can move UP (2,7), DOWN (2,5), LEFT (1,6), or RIGHT (3,6). Note that (1,6) is its own body (first segment), so LEFT is unsafe. So enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. It might go for the apple at (1,8) or (1,9) by moving UP, or towards (7,2) by moving RIGHT? But (7,2) is far. Alternatively, it might move DOWN to (2,5) which is safe.\n\nAfter we eat the apple at (3,3), our head will be at (3,3) and we grow by one segment. Our body becomes: head (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1). So length 6.\n\nNext turn, from (3,3), we can consider moves. But for now, focus on this turn.\n\nRIGHT is the best move to eat the apple.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN: After moving RIGHT to (3,3) and eating the apple, head at (3,3), body [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]. Safe moves next turn: likely UP (3,4), DOWN (3,2), RIGHT (4,3). Avoid LEFT (2,3) because it's your body. Also, enemy might be nearby. We'll have score 5, leading snake #0 (which has 4). Continue to avoid enemy and aim for other apples like (4,0) or (7,2).**\nRIGHT",

Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there, and not your body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- UP (3,4): No apple, but safe. From here, future moves might include UP to (3,5) or RIGHT to (4,4) (which has an apple) or LEFT to (2,4) (but note enemy snake #0 might be nearby).\n- DOWN (3,2): No apple, safe. Future moves could lead to (4,2) or (3,1) etc.\n- RIGHT (4,3): No apple, safe. Future moves could lead to (4,4) (apple) or (5,3) etc.\n\nConsider the apples: \n- (4,4) is adjacent to RIGHT then UP? Actually from (4,3) we can go UP to (4,4) next turn to eat the apple.\n- (1,8) and (1,9) are far and require going through enemy territory? Enemy snake #0 is at (2,7), so moving towards (1,8) might be risky.\n- (4,0) is far down.\n- (7,2) is far right.\n\nAlso, enemy snake #0 at head (2,7) can move:\n- UP: (2,8) - safe?

No body.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. It might go for the apples at (1,8) or (1,9) by moving UP or LEFT? Or it might move RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nWe should avoid head-on collisions. Our head at (3,3) and enemy at (2,7) are not adjacent, so no immediate collision risk this turn.\n\nBut next turn, if we move RIGHT to (4,3), we are closer to the apple at (4,4). Also, moving RIGHT opens more space and avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (3,4) is safe but doesn't directly progress towards an apple. Similarly DOWN to (3,2) moves away from apples.\n\nSo RIGHT seems best to approach (4,4) apple.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: from (4,3), next turn we can go UP to (4,4) to eat the apple, or RIGHT to (5,3), or DOWN to (4,2). So multiple options.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to set up for the apple at (4,4).\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving RIGHT to (4,3), next turn aim for UP to (4,4) to eat the apple. Then we'll have score 6. Continue to avoid enemy snake #0 which might be moving towards (1,8) or (1,9). Also, consider going for (7,2) later.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples collected: 5.\nApples at: (1,8), (1,9), (4,0), (7,2), (4,4)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (2,8) and body: [(2,7), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] (length 5).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (4,3):\n- UP: (4,4) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there (enemy body is at (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,7)), and not your body. However, there is an apple at (4,4). Moving here would eat the apple and grow.\n- DOWN: (4,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there, and not your body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (5,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there, and not your body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- UP (4,4): Directly eats the apple. This increases your score to 6 and grows your snake. After eating, your head will be at (4,4) and your body will extend (so the tail doesn't move this turn, but next turn you'll have an extra segment). This is highly beneficial.\n- DOWN (4,2): No apple, safe. Future moves could lead to (4,1) or (5,2) etc.\n- RIGHT (5,3): No apple, safe. Future moves could lead to (5,4) or (6,3) etc.\n\nConsider enemy snake #0 at head (2,8). It can move:\n- UP: (2,9) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no body there (enemy body is at (2,7), (2,6), etc.). Safe. Also, there is an apple at (1,9) nearby.\n- DOWN: (2,7) - Its own body (first segment), unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no body there. Safe. Also, there is an apple at (1,8).\n- RIGHT: (3,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no body there. Safe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. It is likely to go for the apples at (1,8) or (1,9) by moving LEFT or UP. This means it is moving away from our area (around (4,4)), so minimal risk.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (4,4) to eat the apple is the best move. It directly gains a point and grows your snake. It also positions you well for future moves: from (4,4), you can go UP to (4,5), DOWN to (4,3) (but note your body will be there next turn), LEFT to (3,4), or RIGHT to (5,4). Multiple options.\n\nNote: After eating the apple, your body will extend. So next turn, your body will be: head at (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) (length 7). The tail remains at (1,1) this turn because you grew.\n\nPlan for next turns: After eating the apple at (4,4), consider moving towards other apples like (7,2) or (4,0). Avoid the enemy snake #0 which is likely in the top-left. Also, note that (1,8) and (1,9) are being targeted by the enemy, so we should avoid that area for now. Focus on the bottom-right apples (7,2) and (4,0). Possibly go DOWN from (4,4) to (4,3) next turn? But (4,3) will be your body next turn, so that would be fatal. So avoid DOWN next turn. Instead, from (4,4), safe moves would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. RIGHT to (5,4) might be good to explore the right side.\n\nBut for now, UP is the best move.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,4) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there, and not your body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- UP (4,5): No apple. Moves away from the bottom apples (4,0) and (6,1), but opens up top-right area.\n- LEFT (3,4): No apple. Moves towards left side, but enemy snake #0 is in top-left (head at (1,8)), so caution needed.\n- RIGHT (5,4): No apple. Moves towards right side, closer to apples at (7,2) and (9,8).\n\nConsider enemy snake #0 at head (1,8). It can move:\n- UP: (1,9) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no body there. Safe. There is an apple at (1,9), so it will likely go there to eat.\n- DOWN: (1,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no body there (its body is at (1,5), (1,6)), but note (1,7) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no body there. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,8) - Its own body (first segment), unsafe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. It is very likely to go UP to (1,9) to eat the apple. This will grow it to length 7. After eating, it will be at (1,9) and its body will extend.\n\nLong-term strategy: We have 6 apples, enemy has 5 (but will likely get the apple at (1,9) this turn, making it 6). We need to collect apples to stay ahead. The closest apples to us are (4,0) and (6,1). (7,2) and (9,8) are also options. We should avoid the top-left where the enemy is active. Moving RIGHT towards (5,4) gets us closer to (6,1) and (7,2). From (5,4), we can go DOWN to (5,3) or RIGHT to (6,4) next turn.\n\nLEFT (3,4) is safe but moves towards the enemy area, which might be risky. UP (4,5) is safe but doesn't lead directly to apples.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to progress towards the apples at (6,1) and (7,2). It also keeps us away from the enemy.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving RIGHT to (5,4), consider going DOWN to (5,3) to approach (6,1) or (4,0), or RIGHT to (6,4) to approach (7,2). Avoid moving back into our body (which will be at (4,4), (4,3), etc.). Also, monitor enemy movement; it will be at (1,9) after this turn, so it is far away.\n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s a dead-end next turn \u2014 very dangerous.  \n\n**LEFT to (0, 8) \u2013 no apple:**  \nBody: [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] (no growth).  \nNext turn from (0, 8):  \nUP (0,9) empty.  \nDOWN (0,7) empty.  \nLEFT (-1,8) out of bounds \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (1,8) body \u2192 unsafe.  \nOnly 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Compare:**  \nUP: gets apple, but next turn only 2 moves (LEFT, RIGHT) and at top edge.  \nDOWN: no apple, next turn only 1 move (LEFT) \u2192 trap.  \nLEFT: no apple, next turn 2 moves (UP, DOWN) along left wall.  \n\nDOWN is clearly worst (trapped next turn). Between UP and LEFT:  \nUP gives immediate apple (tie score with enemy), but reduces options next turn.  \nLEFT gives no apple but keeps options slightly better? Actually LEFT also only 2 moves next turn, but at least not at top edge.  \n\nBut maybe I can eat apple now and deal with limited moves next turn by moving away from wall.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy at (4,4) might go UP toward (4,5) or RIGHT toward (5,4) or LEFT toward (3,4). They are far from me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEating apple now gets me closer in score. Next turn from (1,9) I can go LEFT to (0,9) or RIGHT to (2,9). Both are safe unless enemy moves there, which is unlikely.  \n\nLEFT now avoids apple but leaves me at (0,8) with fewer options next turn and still behind in apples.  \n\nGiven the risk of DOWN, and LEFT not gaining apples, I think UP is best despite limited next moves, because:  \n1. Immediate apple gain (tie score 6\u20136).  \n2. Next turn I can go LEFT to (0,9) or RIGHT to (2,9) \u2014 both open.  \n3. Enemy not near top right now.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,9), check if (0,9) or (2,9) is safer (avoid enemy if they move toward top). Possibly aim for (9,8) apple later by moving right across top.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Apples collected: 6.\nApples at: (4,0), (7,2), (9,8), (6,1), (9,7)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (1,9) (it likely moved UP to eat the apple at (1,9) last turn) and now has length 7 (since it ate an apple). Its body: [(1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] (assuming it grew by adding a segment at the tail).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (5,4):\n- UP: (5,5) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there (enemy body is at (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8)), and not your body. Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there, and not your body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,4) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (6,4) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there, and not your body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- UP (5,5): No apple. Moves away from the bottom apples (4,0) and (6,1), but opens up top area.\n- DOWN (5,3): No apple. Moves towards bottom apples (4,0) and (6,1). From (5,3), next moves could be DOWN to (5,2) or LEFT to (4,3) (but (4,3) is your body) or RIGHT to (6,3).\n- RIGHT (6,4): No apple. Moves towards right side, closer to apples at (7,2) and (9,8)/(9,7).\n\nConsider enemy snake #0 at head (1,9). It just ate an apple and is now length 7. It can move:\n- UP: (1,10) - Off the board, unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,8) - Its own body (first segment), unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,9) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no body there. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,9) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no body there. Safe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. It might move LEFT to (0,9) or RIGHT to (2,9). It is not an immediate threat to us.\n\nLong-term strategy: We have 6 apples, enemy has 6. We need to collect apples to stay ahead. The closest apples to us are (4,0) and (6,1). (7,2) and (9,8)/(9,7) are also options. Moving DOWN to (5,3) gets us closer to (4,0) and (6,1). From (5,3), we can go DOWN to (5,2) (then to (5,1) or (6,2)) to approach (6,1), or RIGHT to (6,3) to approach (7,2). Moving RIGHT to (6,4) is also good for approaching (7,2) and (9,8). UP (5,5) is safe but doesn't lead directly to apples.\n\nDOWN seems best because it moves towards the cluster of apples at (4,0) and (6,1). Also, it avoids moving towards the enemy (which is in top-left). We should be cautious not to trap ourselves in the bottom-left, but we have room.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (5,3), consider going DOWN to (5,2) or RIGHT to (6,3). Avoid moving LEFT to (4,3) (your body). The apple at (6,1) is close: from (5,2) we can go RIGHT to (6,2) then DOWN to (6,1). Or from (5,3) go RIGHT to (6,3) then DOWN to (6,2) and DOWN to (6,1). Also, the apple at (4,0) is below: from (5,2) go LEFT to (4,2) then DOWN to (4,1) and DOWN to (4,0). We have options.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

That means whichever I pick, I must plan to survive the next turn by possibly eating an apple to grow into a new space? But there\u2019s no apple at (3, 9) or (0, 8).  \n\nWait \u2014 I must check if moving RIGHT to (2, 9) then next turn RIGHT to (3, 9) gives more options.

Check for snakes: your own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (6,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there, and not your body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- DOWN (5,2): Moves towards apples at (4,0) and (6,1). From (5,2), next moves could be DOWN to (5,1) (then to (5,0) or (6,1)), LEFT to (4,2) (then towards (4,0)), or RIGHT to (6,2) (then towards (6,1) or (7,2)).\n- RIGHT (6,3): Moves towards apples at (7,2) and (9,8)/(9,7). From (6,3), next moves could be DOWN to (6,2) (then to (6,1) or (7,2)), RIGHT to (7,3) (then towards (7,2)), or UP to (6,4) (but (6,4) is safe? Check: no body there currently).\n\nConsider enemy snake #0 at head (2,9).

This is good for us as it reduces immediate collision risk.\n\nLong-term strategy: We have 6 apples, enemy has 6. We need to collect apples to stay ahead. The closest apples to us are (4,0) and (6,1). (7,2) is also close. Moving DOWN to (5,2) gets us closer to (4,0) and (6,1). From (5,2), we can go DOWN to (5,1) (then RIGHT to (6,1) or LEFT to (4,1)), or RIGHT to (6,2) (then DOWN to (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,2)). This gives us flexibility.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,3) is also good for approaching (7,2), but (6,1) and (4,0) are closer. Given that the enemy is moving towards the top-right apples, we should prioritize the bottom-left apples to avoid competition.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (5,2), consider going DOWN to (5,1) to approach (6,1) or (4,0) via LEFT. Alternatively, RIGHT to (6,2) to approach (6,1) or (7,2). Avoid moving UP back into your body.\n\nDOWN is the best move to target the closest apples and maintain future options.\n\nDOWN",

Moving DOWN opens more space in the middle.  \nGiven enemy is far away in lower half, I can safely go DOWN to open more future moves and possibly circle toward apples later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT continues hugging top wall with limited escape routes later.  \nDOWN gives more flexibility and moves toward center while avoiding immediate danger.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose DOWN.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 8), check enemy position.

Apples collected: 6.\nApples at: (4,0), (7,2), (9,8), (6,1), (9,7)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (3,9) (it moved RIGHT to (3,9) as predicted) and body: [(2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] (length 7).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (5,2):\n- UP: (5,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there (enemy is far away), and not your body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body, not your body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body, not your body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- DOWN (5,1): Moves towards apple at (4,0) and (6,1). From (5,1), next moves could be DOWN to (5,0) (then to (4,0)), LEFT to (4,1) (then to (4,0)), or RIGHT to (6,1) (apple at (6,1)).\n- LEFT (4,2): Moves towards apple at (4,0). From (4,2), next moves could be DOWN to (4,1) (then to (4,0)), LEFT to (3,2) (safe?), or UP to (4,3) (your own body? (4,3) is your body segment - unsafe).\n2 safe follow-ups (DOWN and LEFT) if we go LEFT to (4,2).\n- RIGHT (6,2): Moves towards apples at (6,1) and (7,2). From (6,2), next moves could be DOWN to (6,1) (apple), RIGHT to (7,2) (apple), or UP to (6,3) (safe? but (6,3) is currently free, but note your body is at (5,3) and (5,4) - so (6,3) should be safe).\n\nConsider enemy snake #0 at head (3,9). It can move:\n- UP: (3,10) - Off the board, unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no body there (enemy body is at (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)). Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,9) - Its own body (first segment), unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,9) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no body. Safe.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN to (3,8) and RIGHT to (4,9). It is likely to move towards the apples at (9,8) and (9,7) (e.g., RIGHT or DOWN then RIGHT). It is far from us, so no immediate threat.\n\nLong-term strategy: We have 6 apples, enemy has 6. We need to collect apples to stay ahead. The closest apples are (4,0) and (6,1). (7,2) is also close. Moving DOWN to (5,1) gets us very close to (6,1) and (4,0). From (5,1), we have multiple options (DOWN to (5,0) for (4,0), LEFT to (4,1) for (4,0), or RIGHT to (6,1) for the apple). This gives us flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (4,2) also approaches (4,0), but has fewer safe follow-ups (only DOWN and LEFT, UP is blocked by body). Moving RIGHT to (6,2) is good for (6,1) and (7,2), but (4,0) is slightly farther.\n\nDOWN to (5,1) is the best because it positions us to easily get both (6,1) and (4,0) in the next 1-2 moves. It also avoids getting trapped: we have open space below and to the sides.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (5,1), we can:\n- If we want (6,1): move RIGHT to (6,1) (eat apple, grow).\n- If we want (4,0): move DOWN to (5,0) then LEFT to (4,0) (eat apple), or LEFT to (4,1) then DOWN to (4,0).\nWe should prioritize eating an apple quickly to get ahead.\n\nDOWN\nRIGHT",

Apples collected: 6.\nApples at: (4,0), (7,2), (9,8), (6,1), (9,7)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (3,8) and body: [(3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7)] (length 7).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (6,2):\n- UP: (6,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body there (enemy is at (3,8) etc.), and not your body (your body is at (5,2), (5,3), etc. - (6,3) is free). Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body, not your body. Also, there is an apple at (6,1)! Safe and beneficial.\n- LEFT: (5,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body, not your body. Also, there is an apple at (7,2)! Safe and beneficial.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- DOWN (6,1): Immediately eats the apple at (6,1). This will grow your snake by one segment (new tail added, so body becomes length 8). After eating, your head will be at (6,1) and new body: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)].\n- RIGHT (7,2): Immediately eats the apple at (7,2). This will also grow your snake. After eating, head at (7,2), body: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)].\n- UP (6,3): Does not eat an apple, but moves to a safe space. This doesn't grow you immediately.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT immediately get an apple, increasing your score to 7 and giving you a lead over enemy (which has 6). UP does not.\n\nNow, consider follow-up moves after each:\nAfter DOWN to (6,1) (with apple eaten):\n   From (6,1), safe moves? Check:\n      UP: (6,2) - your body (first segment) - unsafe.\n      DOWN: (6,0) - within board? Yes. Free? Currently free. Safe.\n      LEFT: (5,1) - free? Yes. Safe.\n      RIGHT: (7,1) - free? Yes. Safe.\n   So three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). You can then go to (4,0) apple via LEFT and DOWN, or explore other areas.\n\nAfter RIGHT to (7,2) (with apple eaten):\n   From (7,2), safe moves? Check:\n      UP: (7,3) - free? Yes. Safe.\n      DOWN: (7,1) - free? Yes. Safe.\n      LEFT: (6,2) - your body (first segment) - unsafe.\n      RIGHT: (8,2) - free? Yes. Safe.\n   So three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). You can then go to other apples like (9,7) or (9,8).\n\nAfter UP to (6,3):\n   From (6,3), safe moves? Check:\n      UP: (6,4) - free? Yes. Safe.\n      DOWN: (6,2) - your body - unsafe.\n      LEFT: (5,3) - your body - unsafe.\n      RIGHT: (7,3) - free? Yes. Safe.\n   So only two safe moves (UP and RIGHT). This is more restrictive.\n\nTherefore, UP is worse because it has fewer follow-ups and doesn't get an apple.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT, both are excellent. However, DOWN to (6,1) is slightly better because:\n- It is closer to the apple at (4,0) which we can get soon.\n- After eating (6,1), we have the option to go to (4,0) via (5,1) and (4,1) etc.\n- The enemy snake is far away (head at (3,8)), so no immediate threat.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (3,8) can move:\n   UP: (3,9) - its own body? (3,9) is its body segment (second segment) - unsafe.\n   DOWN: (3,7) - free? Yes. Safe.\n   LEFT: (2,8) - its own body? (2,8) is its body segment - unsafe.\n   RIGHT: (4,8) - free? Yes. Safe.\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN to (3,7) and RIGHT to (4,8). It is moving towards the top-right apples (9,8) and (9,7), so it is not a threat to us.\n\nLong-term: We should aim to get both (6,1) and (4,0) quickly. Then we can consider (7,2) and others. Since DOWN gets (6,1) immediately and sets us up for (4,0), it is optimal.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (6,1) and eating the apple, we will have head at (6,1) and body length 8. Then we can move LEFT to (5,1) (safe) and then DOWN to (5,0) and LEFT to (4,0) to eat that apple. Alternatively, we could go DOWN to (6,0) first and then LEFT to (5,0) and (4,0). This path is safe and efficient.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nTurn 27, your snake (ID 1) has head at (6,1) (after moving DOWN last turn and eating the apple at (6,1)). Body: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)] (length 8). Apples collected: 7.\nApples at: (4,0), (7,2), (9,8), (9,7), (2,0)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (4,8) and body: [(3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8)] (length 7).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (6,1):\n- UP: (6,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,0) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body (enemy is far away), not your body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body, not your body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body, not your body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- DOWN (6,0): Moves to a free space. Does not eat an apple immediately.\n- LEFT (5,1): Moves to a free space. Does not eat an apple immediately.\n- RIGHT (7,1): Moves to a free space. Does not eat an apple immediately.\n\nNone of the safe moves directly eat an apple. However, we have a plan to get the apple at (4,0). From (6,1), moving LEFT to (5,1) is the first step towards (4,0). Then we can go DOWN to (5,0) and LEFT to (4,0) to eat it.\n\nAfter LEFT to (5,1):\n   From (5,1), safe moves? Check:\n      UP: (5,2) - your body (second segment) - unsafe.\n      DOWN: (5,0) - free? Yes. Safe.\n      LEFT: (4,1) - free? Yes. Safe.\n      RIGHT: (6,1) - your body (head just left) - unsafe? Actually, (6,1) is now your tail? Wait, after moving LEFT, your head becomes (5,1) and the body shifts: the tail (3,3) is dropped? Actually, since we didn't eat an apple, the tail moves: the last segment (3,3) is removed. So the new body is [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)]? Wait, let's clarify:\n\nAfter moving without eating, the entire snake shifts: head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous segment's position, and the tail is removed. So:\nCurrent body: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)]\nAfter moving LEFT to (5,1):\n   New head: (5,1)\n   New body: [ (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]  (tail (3,3) is gone)\n\nSo from (5,1), the adjacent cells:\n   UP: (5,2) - now part of your body (third segment) - unsafe.\n   DOWN: (5,0) - free? Yes. Safe.\n   LEFT: (4,1) - free? Yes. Safe.\n   RIGHT: (6,1) - now your body (first segment) - unsafe.\n\nSo only DOWN and LEFT are safe. Then from (5,0), we can go LEFT to (4,0) to eat the apple.\n\nSimilarly, if we move DOWN to (6,0):\n   New head: (6,0)\n   New body: [ (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n   Then safe moves from (6,0):\n        UP: (6,1) - body - unsafe.\n        DOWN: (6,-1) - off board - unsafe.\n        LEFT: (5,0) - free? Yes. Safe.\n        RIGHT: (7,0) - free? Yes. Safe.\n   So LEFT and RIGHT. Then LEFT to (5,0) and then LEFT to (4,0) to eat.\n\nBut moving DOWN to (6,0) has a risk: if we go DOWN, we are at the bottom edge (y=0), so only two moves (LEFT and RIGHT) and then from (5,0) we can go LEFT to (4,0). But it is slightly more constrained.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,1):\n   New head: (7,1)\n   New body: [ (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n   Then safe moves from (7,1):\n        UP: (7,2) - there is an apple! But check: (7,2) is free? Currently yes. But we need to check if enemy might go there? Enemy is at (4,8), far away. So safe.\n        DOWN: (7,0) - free? Yes.\n        LEFT: (6,1) - body - unsafe.\n        RIGHT: (8,1) - free? Yes.\n   So three moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. UP gets the apple at (7,2). But then we are moving away from (4,0).\n\nHowever, our plan was to get (4,0) first. So moving RIGHT delays that plan.\n\nTherefore, LEFT to (5,1) is the best step towards (4,0). It gives us two safe options (DOWN to (5,0) or LEFT to (4,1)), and from (5,0) we can get (4,0) next.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (4,8) can move:\n   UP: (4,9) - free? Yes. Safe.\n   DOWN: (4,7) - free? Yes. Safe.\n   LEFT: (3,8) - its own body (first segment) - unsafe.\n   RIGHT: (5,8) - free? Yes. Safe.\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. It is likely to go towards the apples at (9,8) and (9,7), so no threat to us.\n\nLong-term plan: Get the apple at (4,0) by moving LEFT to (5,1) now, then DOWN to (5,0), then LEFT to (4,0). After that, we can consider going for (7,2) or others.\n\nLEFT",

Apples collected: 7.\nApples at: (4,0), (7,2), (9,8), (9,7), (2,0)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (5,8) and body: [(4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8)] (length 7).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (5,1):\n- UP: (5,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,0) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body (enemy is far away), not your body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body, not your body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, which is best?\n- DOWN (5,0): Moves to a free space. This is one step closer to the apple at (4,0). From (5,0), we can then move LEFT to (4,0) to eat the apple next turn.\n- LEFT (4,1): Moves to a free space. This is also a step towards (4,0), but not as direct. From (4,1), we can move DOWN to (4,0) next turn to eat the apple.\n\nBoth moves lead to the apple at (4,0) in two steps. However, moving DOWN to (5,0) is more direct because it puts us adjacent to (4,0) horizontally. From (4,1), we need to go DOWN to (4,0), which is also adjacent.\n\nBut note: after moving DOWN to (5,0), we are at the bottom edge (y=0). This limits our moves next turn: from (5,0), we can only move UP (to (5,1), which is unsafe because it's our body), LEFT (to (4,0)), or RIGHT (to (6,0)). So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. LEFT leads to the apple.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,1), we are not at an edge. From (4,1), safe moves would be UP (to (4,2)), DOWN (to (4,0)), LEFT (to (3,1)), or RIGHT (to (5,1) - unsafe). So three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. DOWN gets the apple.\n\nSo both moves allow us to get the apple next turn. However, moving DOWN to (5,0) leaves us with fewer options (only two moves) next turn, while moving LEFT to (4,1) leaves us with three moves. Therefore, LEFT is slightly better for maintaining flexibility.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy: snake #0 at (5,8) is far away and moving towards the apples at (9,8) and (9,7). No immediate threat.\n\nLong-term plan: Get the apple at (4,0) next turn. After that, we can consider going for (7,2) or (2,0). (7,2) is closer and might be a good target after (4,0). From (4,0), we can move RIGHT to (5,0) or UP to (4,1), then towards (7,2).\n\nGiven that both DOWN and LEFT are safe and lead to the apple, but LEFT (to (4,1)) gives more options next turn, I choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] (length 9). Apples collected: 8.\nApples at: (7,2), (9,8), (9,7), (2,0), (2,7)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (7,8) and body: [(6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)] (length 7).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (4,0):\n- UP: (4,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (4,-1) - Outside board (y=-1). Dies.\n- LEFT: (3,0) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body (enemy is far away), not your body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,0) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: no enemy body, not your body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- (2,0) is two steps LEFT (LEFT to (3,0), then LEFT to (2,0)).\n- (7,2) is farther: from (4,0), we need to go RIGHT and UP.\n- Other apples are even farther.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7,8) and likely heading towards the apples at (9,8) and (9,7). It is not a direct threat to us.\n\nLEFT moves us closer to (2,0), which is the closest apple. RIGHT moves us away from it.\n\nAlso, check future moves from (3,0) if we go LEFT:\nFrom (3,0), we can go UP (3,1), LEFT (2,0) to eat the apple, or RIGHT (4,0) but that is our current head (so unsafe next turn? Actually, next turn our body will have moved, so (4,0) might be safe? But careful: after we move LEFT to (3,0), our body will shift: new head at (3,0), then (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), ... and tail at (4,4) remains? Actually, since we did not eat an apple this turn (we ate last turn), we do not grow. So the tail moves: the last segment (4,4) is dropped? Wait, no: last turn we ate an apple (at (4,0)), so we grew. Therefore, this turn we are length 9. When we move without eating, the tail moves. So if we move LEFT to (3,0), the new body becomes: head (3,0), then (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) (tail). So (4,4) is gone.\n\nSo from (3,0), next turn:\n- UP: (3,1) - safe? Check: not our body (our body has (4,0), (4,1), ... so (3,1) is free).\n- LEFT: (2,0) - safe? Check: apple at (2,0), and not our body.\n- RIGHT: (4,0) - safe? Check: our body has (4,0) as the second segment? Actually, after moving, the body is [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), ...]. So (4,0) is occupied by our own body. So RIGHT would be unsafe.\nSo from (3,0), only UP and LEFT are safe next turn.\n\nSimilarly, if we go RIGHT to (5,0):\nFrom (5,0), next turn:\n- UP: (5,1) - our body? Yes, (5,1) is the third segment. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,-1) - outside board.\n- LEFT: (4,0) - our body? Yes, second segment.\n- RIGHT: (6,0) - safe? Probably, but not helpful for apples.\n\nSo RIGHT leads to a dead-end: only one safe move next turn (RIGHT to (6,0)), which might not be productive.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is better because it gives two safe moves next turn (UP and LEFT) and moves us directly towards the apple at (2,0).\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (3,0) this turn. Next turn, move LEFT to (2,0) to eat the apple. This will increase our length to 10 and apple count to 9. Then from (2,0), we can consider moving UP towards (2,7) or other apples.\n\nSo choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (second segment is (4,0)). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- (2,0) is directly LEFT. Eating it would grow us to length 10 and give 9 apples.\n- (2,7) is also available, but farther.\n- Other apples are distant.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,8) and likely heading towards the apples at (9,8) and (9,7).

Actually, after growing, the body is [(2,0), (3,0), (4,0), ...]. So (3,0) is occupied. Unsafe.\nSo only UP and LEFT are safe from (2,0) next turn.\n\nIf we go UP to (3,1):\nFrom (3,1), we don't eat an apple. Then our body becomes: head (3,1), then (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3) (tail). So length 9 (no growth).\nFrom (3,1), next turn:\n- UP: (3,2) - safe?

Actually, (2,7) is far. Also, we remain at length 8 apples? Wait, we have 8 apples collected, but length is 9. After moving without eating, length remains 9.\n\nLEFT is clearly better because it gets us an apple and increases our score. Also, it positions us to potentially go towards (2,7) next by moving UP from (2,0).\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (2,0), move UP towards (2,7) or other apples. Avoid getting trapped in the bottom left corner.\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Apples collected: 9.\nApples at: (7,2), (9,7), (2,7), (8,6), (6,5)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (9,8) and body: [(8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9)] (length 8).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (2,0):\n- UP: (2,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (3,0), (4,0), ...; (2,1) is free). Not enemy body (enemy is far). Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,-1) - Outside board (y=-1). Dies.\n- LEFT: (1,0) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body segments are all above or right; (1,0) is free). Not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,0) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (second segment is (3,0)). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- The closest apple is (2,7) which is 7 steps away vertically. Others are (6,5), (7,2), (8,6), (9,7).\n- Going UP from (2,0) to (2,1) moves directly towards (2,7).\n- Going LEFT to (1,0) does not move towards any apple immediately, but might be part of a path.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (9,8) and likely heading towards apples (9,7) or (8,6). It is not a threat to us currently.\n\nFrom (2,0), if we go UP to (2,1):\n- We don't eat an apple, so no growth. New body: head (2,1), then (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3) (tail). Length remains 10.\n- Next turn from (2,1): \n  - UP: (2,2) - safe? Probably free.\n  - DOWN: (2,0) - unsafe (occupied by second segment).\n  - LEFT: (1,1) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (3,1) - safe? Check: (3,1) is not in our body (current body: (2,0), (3,0), ...; (3,1) is free). So safe.\nSo three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFrom (2,0), if we go LEFT to (1,0):\n- We don't eat an apple. New body: head (1,0), then (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3) (tail). Length 10.\n- Next turn from (1,0):\n  - UP: (1,1) - safe.\n  - DOWN: (1,-1) - off board, dies.\n  - LEFT: (0,0) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (2,0) - unsafe (occupied by second segment).\nSo only UP and LEFT are safe.\n\nTherefore, going UP gives more future options (three moves) while going LEFT only gives two. Also, UP moves directly towards the apple at (2,7). We should prioritize moving towards apples and maintaining flexibility.\n\nLong-term plan: Move upwards towards (2,7). After reaching (2,7), consider targeting (6,5) or (7,2). Avoid the enemy snake which is in the top-right. We are longer than the enemy (10 vs 8), so we have an advantage.\n\nChoose UP to move towards the apple and keep more options open.\n\nUP",

Apples collected: 9.\nApples at: (7,2), (2,7), (8,6), (6,5), (6,3)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (9,7) and body: [(9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (3,9)] (length 9? Wait, it had 8 apples last turn, so length should be 9 segments: head + 8 body parts. But the body list has 8 segments? Actually, the body list provided for snake #0 has 8 tuples: [(9,8), ... (3,9)] which is 8 segments, plus the head (9,7) makes 9 segments total. So it has grown to length 9? But apples collected is 8. Actually, the body length should be apples+1. So with 8 apples, it should have 9 segments. The body list given has 8 segments, which is correct (head is separate). So enemy length is 9.\n\nNow, check each direction from your head (2,1):\n- UP: (2,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body: (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3); (2,2) is free). Not enemy body (enemy body is all above y=7 mostly). Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,0) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment of body is (2,0)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has no (1,1)). Not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (3,0) and (4,1), etc.; (3,1) is free). Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- The closest apple is (2,7) at distance |2-2| + |7-1| = 6 steps vertically. Also (6,3) is at |6-2|+|3-1|=4+2=6 steps? Actually, (6,3) is 4 in x and 2 in y, so 6 steps. Similarly (7,2) is 5 in x and 1 in y = 6 steps. So multiple apples are 6 steps away.\n- Going UP to (2,2) moves directly towards (2,7) and also towards (6,3) and (7,2) in the long run.\n- Going RIGHT to (3,1) moves towards (6,3) and (7,2) but away from (2,7).\n- Going LEFT to (1,1) moves away from all apples except possibly (2,7) but indirectly.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (6,3) is very close to your body? Your body has (5,3) and (6,2), so (6,3) is adjacent to your body segments. But it is safe to go there if we plan.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (9,7) and likely heading towards apples (8,6) or (9,7) itself? Actually (9,7) is an apple? Wait, the apples list has (7,2), (2,7), (8,6), (6,5), (6,3). So (9,7) is not an apple? But the board shows 'A' at (7,2), (2,7), (8,6), (6,5), (6,3). So (9,7) is not an apple. The enemy might be going for (8,6) which is close.\n\nWe are longer than the enemy (10 vs 9), so we have a slight advantage.\n\nFuture options from each move:\nFrom (2,1) if we go UP to (2,2):\n- Next turn, head at (2,2). Safe moves? Check:\n  - UP: (2,3) - free.\n  - DOWN: (2,1) - unsafe (occupied by current head? Actually, after move, the body will be [ (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), ... ] so (2,1) is body segment. So unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (1,2) - free.\n  - RIGHT: (3,2) - free.\nSo three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFrom (2,1) if we go LEFT to (1,1):\n- Next turn, head at (1,1). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (1,2) - free.\n  - DOWN: (1,0) - free? Check: (1,0) is not in body? Body will be [ (1,1), (2,0), (3,0), ... ] so (1,0) is free.\n  - LEFT: (0,1) - free.\n  - RIGHT: (2,1) - unsafe (occupied by body).\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nFrom (2,1) if we go RIGHT to (3,1):\n- Next turn, head at (3,1). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (3,2) - free.\n  - DOWN: (3,0) - unsafe (body has (3,0)).\n  - LEFT: (2,1) - unsafe (body).\n  - RIGHT: (4,1) - free? Check: body has (4,0) and (4,1)? Actually, body has (4,0) and (4,1). So (4,1) is occupied. Unsafe.\nSo only UP is safe? Wait, let's list the body after moving RIGHT: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) (tail). So segments: (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2). So (4,1) is indeed a body segment. Therefore, from (3,1):\n  - UP: (3,2) - free.\n  - DOWN: (3,0) - occupied.\n  - LEFT: (2,1) - occupied.\n  - RIGHT: (4,1) - occupied.\nSo only UP is safe. This is very restrictive.\n\nTherefore, going RIGHT leads to a dead-end with only one safe move next turn. We should avoid that.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, both give three safe moves next turn. However, UP moves towards the apple at (2,7) and also towards (6,3) and (7,2). LEFT moves away from most apples.\n\nWe should prioritize moving towards apples. Also, the apple at (6,3) is very close and we can potentially eat it soon.\n\nLong-term plan: Move upwards to (2,2), then continue towards (2,7) or possibly divert to (6,3) if safe. Avoid the enemy which is in the top-right. We are longer, so we can be aggressive but avoid head-on collisions.\n\nChoose UP to move towards apples and maintain flexibility.\n\nUP",

Body: [(2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)] (length 10). Apples collected: 9.\nApples at: (7,2), (2,7), (8,6), (6,5), (6,3)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (8,7) and body: [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)] (length 9).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (2,2):\n- UP: (2,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body: all below y=2 except (5,2) at same y? Actually, (5,2) is at y=2 but x=5, so (2,3) is free). Not enemy body (enemy body is at y>=8). Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,1) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment of body is (2,1)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (3,0) and (5,2), etc.; (3,2) is free). Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- The apple at (2,7) is directly above us. Moving UP gets us closer.\n- The apple at (6,3) is to the right and up. Moving UP or RIGHT gets closer.\n- The apple at (7,2) is to the right and same y? Actually, (7,2) is at x=7,y=2. We are at (2,2), so same y. Moving RIGHT gets closer.\n- The apple at (6,5) is further away.\n- The apple at (8,6) is even further and near the enemy.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,7) and likely heading towards (8,6) or (6,5). We are longer (10 vs 9), so we can be aggressive but avoid head-on collisions.\n\nFuture options from each move:\nFrom (2,2) if we go UP to (2,3):\n- Next turn, head at (2,3). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (2,4) - free.\n  - DOWN: (2,2) - unsafe (occupied by current head? After move, body will be [(2,2), (2,1), ...] so (2,2) is body). Unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (1,3) - free.\n  - RIGHT: (3,3) - free.\nSo three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFrom (2,2) if we go LEFT to (1,2):\n- Next turn, head at (1,2). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (1,3) - free.\n  - DOWN: (1,1) - free? Check: body will be [(1,2), (2,1), (2,0), ...] so (1,1) is free.\n  - LEFT: (0,2) - free.\n  - RIGHT: (2,2) - unsafe (body).\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nFrom (2,2) if we go RIGHT to (3,2):\n- Next turn, head at (3,2). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (3,3) - free.\n  - DOWN: (3,1) - free? Check: body will be [(3,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), ...] so (3,1) is free.\n  - LEFT: (2,2) - unsafe (body).\n  - RIGHT: (4,2) - free? Check: body has (4,0) and (4,1), but (4,2) is free.\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nAll three moves give three safe options next turn. However, moving UP directly towards (2,7) is very efficient. Moving RIGHT also gets us closer to (6,3) and (7,2). Moving LEFT moves away from all apples.\n\nWe should prioritize moving towards apples. UP is the best for (2,7), and RIGHT is good for (6,3) and (7,2). Since (2,7) is closer in terms of vertical distance (only 5 steps up), and we are already at (2,2), going UP is optimal.\n\nAlso, note that the apple at (6,3) is adjacent to our body segments (like (5,2) and (6,2)), but we can safely approach it from above or right.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving upwards to (2,7). After eating (2,7), we can consider moving right towards (6,5) or (8,6). Avoid the enemy in the top-right; since we are longer, we can force it to avoid us.\n\nChoose UP to maximize progress towards the closest apple and maintain flexibility.\n\nUP",

After moving to (7, 6), body: head (7, 6), then (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), tail (3, 8).  \nUP (7, 7) is not in body (body has (8, 7) and (7, 8) but not (7, 7)) \u2192 safe.  \nDOWN (7, 5) empty.  \nLEFT (6, 6) empty.  \nRIGHT (8, 6) body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn too.\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 6):**  \nNext turn from (9, 6):  \nUP (9, 7) body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (9, 5) empty.  \nLEFT (8, 6) body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nOnly 1 safe move (DOWN) \u2192 risky.\n\nSo RIGHT is bad.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term positioning:**  \nEnemy is at (2, 3), might go toward apples (6, 3) or (6, 5). If I go DOWN to (8, 5), I\u2019m closer to (6, 5) but enemy might reach (6, 3) first.  \nLEFT to (7, 6) keeps me central, maybe better to approach (6, 5) from left side next turn.  \n\nBut DOWN (8, 5) also opens path to (7, 2) later if needed.  \n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Plan for next few turns:**  \nFrom (8, 5) next turn, I can go LEFT to (7, 5) then toward (6, 5).  \nFrom (7, 6) next turn, I can go DOWN to (7, 5) then toward (6, 5).  \nActually similar.  \n\nBut DOWN (8, 5) also avoids moving toward top-right corner where my body is bunched. My body is mostly top-right (y=7,8), so moving DOWN opens space.  \n\nLEFT (7, 6) moves parallel to body cluster, still okay but less vertical space opening.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN seems slightly better for opening space and moving toward apples (6, 5) and (6, 3).  \n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:** From (8, 5), consider moving LEFT toward (6, 5) unless enemy is close, else go DOWN toward (7, 2) or (6, 3). Keep central options.\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] (length 10). Apples collected: 9.\nApples at: (7,2), (2,7), (6,5), (6,3), (4,7)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (8,6) and body: [(8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)] (length 9).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (2,3):\n- UP: (2,4) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body is below y=3 except (6,2) at y=2). Not enemy body (enemy body is at y>=8). Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,2) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment of body is (2,2)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- The apple at (2,7) is directly above us. Moving UP gets us closer.\n- The apple at (6,3) is to the right and same y? Actually, (6,3) is at x=6,y=3. We are at (2,3), so same y. Moving RIGHT gets closer.\n- The apple at (7,2) is to the right and down, but we are at y=3, so moving RIGHT then DOWN might be efficient.\n- The apple at (4,7) is up and right.\n- The apple at (6,5) is further right and up.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,6) and likely heading towards (6,5) or (4,7). We are longer (10 vs 9), so we can be aggressive but avoid head-on collisions.\n\nFuture options from each move:\nFrom (2,3) if we go UP to (2,4):\n- Next turn, head at (2,4). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (2,5) - free.\n  - DOWN: (2,3) - unsafe (body).\n  - LEFT: (1,4) - free.\n  - RIGHT: (3,4) - free.\nSo three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFrom (2,3) if we go LEFT to (1,3):\n- Next turn, head at (1,3). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (1,4) - free.\n  - DOWN: (1,2) - free? Check: body will be [(1,3), (2,2), (2,1), ...] so (1,2) is free.\n  - LEFT: (0,3) - free.\n  - RIGHT: (2,3) - unsafe (body).\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nFrom (2,3) if we go RIGHT to (3,3):\n- Next turn, head at (3,3). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (3,4) - free.\n  - DOWN: (3,2) - free? Check: body will be [(3,3), (2,2), (2,1), ...] so (3,2) is free.\n  - LEFT: (2,3) - unsafe (body).\n  - RIGHT: (4,3) - free? Check: body has (4,0), (4,1), but (4,3) is free.\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nAll three moves give three safe options next turn. However, moving UP directly towards (2,7) is very efficient. Moving RIGHT gets us closer to (6,3) and (7,2). Moving LEFT moves away from all apples.\n\nWe should prioritize moving towards apples. UP is the best for (2,7), and RIGHT is good for (6,3) and (7,2). Since (2,7) is closer in terms of vertical distance (only 4 steps up from y=3 to y=7), and we are already at (2,3), going UP is optimal.\n\nAlso, note that the apple at (6,3) is adjacent to our body segments (like (6,2)), but we can safely approach it from above or right. However, moving RIGHT now would put us at (3,3), which is still far from (6,3).\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving upwards to (2,7). After eating (2,7), we can consider moving right towards (4,7) or (6,5). Avoid the enemy in the top-right; since we are longer, we can force it to avoid us.\n\nChoose UP to maximize progress towards the closest apple and maintain flexibility.\n\nUP",

Body: [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1)] (length 10). Apples collected: 9.\nApples at: (7,2), (2,7), (6,5), (6,3), (4,7)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (7,5) and body: [(8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)] (length 9).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (2,5):\n- UP: (2,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body is below y=5). Not enemy body (enemy body is at y>=5? Enemy head is at (7,5), body segments: (8,5) is at same y=5, but we are at (2,6) so no conflict). Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,4) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment of body is (2,4)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,5) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body (enemy body is mostly right and top). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,5) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- The apple at (2,7) is directly above us (2 steps away: (2,6) then (2,7)).\n- The apple at (4,7) is up and right (path: e.g., RIGHT to (3,5), then UP to (3,6), then RIGHT to (4,6), then UP to (4,7) - 4 steps).\n- The apple at (6,5) is to the right (path: e.g., RIGHT to (3,5), then RIGHT to (4,5), then RIGHT to (5,5), then RIGHT to (6,5) - 4 steps).\n- The apple at (6,3) is right and down (but we are at y=5, so moving DOWN is unsafe, so we'd need to go RIGHT then DOWN later).\n- The apple at (7,2) is further right and down.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7,5). It might be heading towards (6,5) or (4,7). Since we are longer (10 vs 9), we can be aggressive but avoid head-on collisions.\n\nFuture options from each move:\nFrom (2,5) if we go UP to (2,6):\n- Next turn, head at (2,6). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (2,7) - free (and apple!).\n  - DOWN: (2,5) - unsafe (body).\n  - LEFT: (1,6) - free.\n  - RIGHT: (3,6) - free.\nSo three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. And UP leads to apple.\n\nFrom (2,5) if we go LEFT to (1,5):\n- Next turn, head at (1,5). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (1,6) - free.\n  - DOWN: (1,4) - free? Check: body will be [(1,5), (2,4), (2,3), ...] so (1,4) is free.\n  - LEFT: (0,5) - free.\n  - RIGHT: (2,5) - unsafe (body).\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. But moves us away from apples.\n\nFrom (2,5) if we go RIGHT to (3,5):\n- Next turn, head at (3,5). Safe moves?\n  - UP: (3,6) - free.\n  - DOWN: (3,4) - free? Check: body will be [(3,5), (2,4), (2,3), ...] so (3,4) is free.\n  - LEFT: (2,5) - unsafe (body).\n  - RIGHT: (4,5) - free? Check: body has (4,0), (4,1), but (4,5) is free.\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Gets closer to (4,7) and (6,5).\n\nThe closest apple is (2,7) at Manhattan distance 2. Moving UP gets us directly closer. Moving RIGHT or LEFT does not help immediately for (2,7). Also, after eating (2,7), we can plan to move right towards other apples.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,5), which is far from (2,7), so no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is optimal to reach the closest apple quickly and safely.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (2,7), we should consider moving right towards (4,7) or (6,5). Be cautious of enemy snake #0 which might be competing for those apples. Since we are longer, we can force it to avoid us. Avoid head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

Apples collected: 9.\nApples at: (7,2), (2,7), (6,3), (4,7), (8,0)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (6,5) and body: [(7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)] (length 10).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (2,6):\n- UP: (2,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body is below y=6). Not enemy body (enemy body is at x>=5 and y>=5). There is an apple at (2,7)! So moving UP will eat the apple and grow.\n- DOWN: (2,5) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment of body is (2,5)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- The apple at (2,7) is directly above us (1 step away). Moving UP will eat it immediately.\n- Other apples: (4,7) is to the right and up, (6,3) is to the right and down, (7,2) is far right and down, (8,0) is far right and down.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (6,5). It might be heading towards (4,7) or (6,3) or (7,2). Since both snakes are now length 10 (we are tied), we should avoid head-on collisions.\n\nIf we move UP to (2,7) and eat the apple, we will grow to length 11. Our tail will not move this turn (because we eat an apple), so next turn our body will be: head at (2,7), body segments: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)] (length 11).\n\nAfter eating (2,7), we can plan to move right towards (4,7) or other apples. From (2,7), safe moves would likely be LEFT (to (1,7)), RIGHT (to (3,7)), or DOWN (to (2,6) but that might be unsafe next turn? Actually, after eating, our body will include (2,6), so DOWN would be unsafe. So only LEFT and RIGHT would be safe from (2,7) next turn? Let's simulate:\n\nAfter moving UP to (2,7) and eating:\nNext turn head at (2,7). Body: [ (2,6), (2,5), ... (4,1) ].\nSafe moves from (2,7):\n- UP: (2,8) - free? Check: not our body, not enemy body (enemy body is at lower y? Actually enemy has segments at y=8: (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8) - all at x>=5). So (2,8) is safe.\n- DOWN: (2,6) - unsafe (our body).\n- LEFT: (1,7) - free.\n- RIGHT: (3,7) - free.\nSo three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nSo we can go UP to (2,8), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7). This gives flexibility.\n\nIf we move LEFT or RIGHT now instead of UP, we miss the immediate apple and might allow enemy to get closer to other apples.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is optimal to eat the apple at (2,7) and become longer than enemy (11 vs 10). This gives us an advantage.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (2,7), consider moving RIGHT towards (4,7) or (6,3). Avoid enemy head at (6,5) - it might move towards (4,7) or (5,5) etc. Since we are longer, we can be cautious but aggressive. From (2,7), moving RIGHT to (3,7) then UP to (3,8) or RIGHT to (4,7) might be good.\n\nUP",

They likely go for apple (4, 7) via RIGHT then UP, or (2, 7) already eaten? Wait, apple (2, 7) was there last turn; if enemy moved UP from (2, 6) to (2, 7) last turn, they ate it. Yes, enemy now has 10 apples, so they ate (2, 7) last turn. Current apples: (7, 2), (6, 3), (4, 7), (8, 0), (5, 3). Enemy may now target (4, 7) or (5, 3).\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nFrom my head (6, 4):  \n- DOWN (6, 3): apple directly.  \n- LEFT (5, 4): moves toward (5, 3) apple.  \n- RIGHT (7, 4): moves toward (7, 2) apple.  \n\nClosest is DOWN to (6, 3) (distance 1).

RIGHT is distance 3 to (7, 2).\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (6, 3):**  \nNext turn from (6, 3):  \nUP (6, 4) \u2013 body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (6, 2) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT (5, 3) \u2013 apple, safe.  \nRIGHT (7, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n3 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n**LEFT to (5, 4):**  \nNext turn from (5, 4):  \nUP (5, 5) \u2013 empty.  \nDOWN (5, 3) \u2013 apple, safe.  \nLEFT (4, 4) \u2013 empty.  \nRIGHT (6, 4) \u2013 body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 4):**  \nNext turn from (7, 4):  \nUP (7, 5) \u2013 body (third segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (7, 3) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT (6, 4) \u2013 body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (8, 4) \u2013 empty.  \nOnly 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT) \u2014 riskier.\n\nSo RIGHT reduces future options.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy at (2, 7) is far (Manhattan distance 7). No immediate collision risk.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Score consideration:**  \nTied at 10 apples each. Eating (6, 3) gives me lead 11\u201310. Also removes apple enemy could go for. LEFT also gets me to (5, 3) soon, but DOWN gets apple immediately.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nTake immediate apple (6, 3) to regain lead. Then consider moving toward (7, 2) or (8, 0) while keeping distance from enemy. Avoid getting trapped in lower-left corner after eating southern apples; loop back toward center via right side.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN gets apple now, keeps good future options, avoids riskier RIGHT move.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nTurn 39, your snake (ID 1) has head at (2,7) (after moving UP last turn). You just ate the apple at (2,7), so you now have 10 apples and your length is 11. Your body: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1)] (tail is (4,1)). Since you ate an apple, your tail did not move this turn.\n\nApples at: (7,2), (6,3), (4,7), (8,0), (5,3)  [Note: (2,7) was eaten, so removed]\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (6,4) (it moved DOWN last turn) and body: [(6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)] (length 10).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (2,7):\n- UP: (2,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body is at y<=7). Not enemy body (enemy body is at x>=5 and y>=4? Actually, enemy has segments at (6,5), (7,5), etc. - (2,8) is safe). Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment is (2,6)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- The closest apples are (4,7) (to the right, same y) and (6,3) (to the right and down). Also (5,3) is near (6,3).\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (6,4). It might be heading towards (4,7) or (6,3) or (5,3). Since it moved DOWN to (6,4), it might be going for (6,3) or (5,3).\n\nWe are longer than enemy (11 vs 10), so we can be aggressive but cautious. We should avoid head-on collisions with enemy head at (6,4). The enemy might move LEFT to (5,4), DOWN to (6,3) (to eat apple?), RIGHT to (7,4), or UP to (6,5) (but that is its own body? Actually, enemy body has (6,5) as first segment, so UP is unsafe for enemy). So enemy safe moves: LEFT (5,4), DOWN (6,3), RIGHT (7,4). It might go for (6,3) since there is an apple.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (3,7), we get closer to (4,7). From (3,7), we can then go RIGHT to (4,7) to eat the apple next turn. Alternatively, we can move UP to (2,8) to avoid immediate conflict and plan a path to other apples later.\n\nLong-term plan: We should aim for (4,7) since it is close. However, enemy might also be heading there. Since we are longer, if we meet head-on at (4,7), we would both die (same head collision). So we need to be careful.\n\nFrom (2,7):\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,7) puts us one step away from (4,7). Next turn, if enemy moves to (5,4) or (6,3), we can safely move to (4,7) and eat it.\n- Moving UP to (2,8) is safe but doesn't get us closer to apples immediately.\n- Moving LEFT to (1,7) moves away from apples.\n\nSo RIGHT seems best to pursue (4,7). However, we must check if enemy might also go to (4,7). Enemy head at (6,4) is 2 steps away from (4,7) (via LEFT twice: (5,4) then (4,4) then (4,5)? Actually, to get to (4,7), enemy would need to go LEFT and UP: e.g., (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (4,6) -> (4,7) in 4 moves. We can get to (4,7) in 2 moves: (3,7) -> (4,7). So we have an advantage.\n\nBut if enemy moves LEFT to (5,4) this turn, and we move RIGHT to (3,7), then next turn enemy might move LEFT to (4,4) and we move RIGHT to (4,7). Then no head collision. So it is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if enemy moves DOWN to (6,3) to eat the apple there, we can take (4,7) without conflict.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is good to get closer to (4,7).\n\nWe could also consider moving UP to (2,8) to have more options, but that delays eating.\n\nSince we are longer, we should be aggressive and eat apples quickly to reach 30.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (3,7), next turn move RIGHT to (4,7) to eat the apple. Then we become length 12. Then from (4,7), we can go UP to (4,8), DOWN to (4,6), LEFT to (3,7), or RIGHT to (5,7). We should avoid enemy head which might be near.\n\nSo for now, move RIGHT to (3,7).\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nTurn 40, your snake (ID 1) has head at (3,7) (after moving RIGHT last turn). Your body: [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)] (length 11). You did not eat an apple last turn (since no apple at (3,7)), so your tail moved (the last segment (4,1) is gone, and now tail is at (4,0)).\n\nApples at: (7,2), (4,7), (8,0), (5,3), (6,7)\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (6,3) (it moved DOWN last turn to eat the apple at (6,3)?) and body: [(6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)] (length 12? It had 11 apples, so length 12 after eating the apple at (6,3)). So enemy now has 12 apples and length 12, same as us (we have 10 apples, length 11? Wait: we have 10 apples, so our length is 11. Enemy had 11 apples, so after eating (6,3), it has 12 apples and length 13? Actually, initial length is number of body segments + head. Enemy had 11 segments (head + 10 body) and 11 apples. After eating, it grows to 12 segments (head + 11 body). So enemy length is 12, same as us (we have head + 10 body = 11 segments, and 10 apples). Correction: we have 10 apples, so our length is 11 (head + 10 body). Enemy has 12 apples, so length is 13 (head + 12 body). So enemy is longer than us now.\n\nCheck each direction from your head (3,7):\n- UP: (3,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body is at x=2,3,4 and y<=7). Not enemy body (enemy body is at x>=6 and y>=3? (3,8) is safe). Safe.\n- DOWN: (3,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (2,6) but not (3,6)). Not enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment is (2,7)). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. There is an apple at (4,7). Also, check for enemy: enemy head is at (6,3), not here. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (4,7) is adjacent to RIGHT. If we move RIGHT, we eat it and grow to length 12 (11 apples).\n- Other apples: (6,7) is close (2 steps right and same y), (5,3) and (7,2) are farther.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (6,3). It might be heading towards (5,3) or (7,2) or (6,7). Since it just ate, it might not be hungry immediately, but we should avoid head-on collisions.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (4,7) to eat the apple, we become length 12 (11 apples). Enemy is length 13 (12 apples). So we are still shorter.\n\nFrom (4,7), we can go UP to (4,8), DOWN to (4,6), LEFT to (3,7), or RIGHT to (5,7). We should avoid moving towards enemy head (6,3).\n\nAlternatively, we can move UP to (3,8) or DOWN to (3,6) to avoid immediate conflict, but that delays eating.\n\nSince (4,7) is right there, we should eat it to catch up in length. Also, eating apples quickly is important to reach 30.\n\nCheck for head-on collision risk: enemy head at (6,3) is 3 steps away from (4,7) (e.g., (5,3)->(4,3)->(4,4)->(4,5)->(4,6)->(4,7) in 5 moves? Actually, Manhattan distance is |6-4| + |3-7| = 2+4=6). So no immediate risk.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (4,7) is safe and gets us an apple.\n\nWe should also consider future moves: after eating at (4,7), we need to avoid enemy. Enemy might come towards us. But we can then move UP to (4,8) or DOWN to (4,6) to escape.\n\nSo for now, move RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nPlan for next turns: After eating at (4,7), we should move UP to (4,8) to get away from enemy head (which is south) and open more options. From (4,8), we can go LEFT to (3,8), RIGHT to (5,8), or UP to (4,9). Avoid DOWN back to (4,7) because enemy might approach.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

You now have 11 apples (so length 12).\n\nApples at: (7,2), (8,0), (6,7), (3,4), (4,6) [Note: (4,7) was eaten last turn, so removed]\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (5,3) and body: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)] (length 13, since it has 12 apples).\n\nNow, check each direction from your head (4,7):\n- UP: (4,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body is at x=2,3,4 and y<=7). Not enemy body (enemy body is at x>=6 and y>=3? (4,8) is safe). Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (2,6) but not (4,6)). There is an apple at (4,6). Also, check for enemy: enemy head is at (5,3), not here. Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment is (3,7)). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (5,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body (enemy body is at lower y). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (4,6) is adjacent DOWN. If we move DOWN, we eat it and grow to length 13 (12 apples).\n- Apple at (6,7) is close (2 steps RIGHT).\n- Other apples: (3,4) is close (3 steps LEFT and DOWN, but we cannot go LEFT now), (7,2) and (8,0) are farther.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (5,3). It might be heading towards (3,4) or (7,2). Since it is longer than us (13 vs 12), we should avoid head-on collisions.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (4,6), we eat the apple immediately and become length 13 (same as enemy). This is good for catching up.\n\nFrom (4,6), we can go UP to (4,7) (but that is our current head, so not backwards), LEFT to (3,6), RIGHT to (5,6), or DOWN to (4,5). We should avoid moving towards enemy head (5,3).\n\nAlternatively, we can move UP to (4,8) to open more options, but that doesn't eat an apple immediately.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5,7) doesn't eat an apple now, but gets us closer to (6,7).\n\nSince eating apples quickly is important, moving DOWN to (4,6) to eat the apple is beneficial. It also moves us away from the enemy head (which is at y=3) and towards the bottom of the board where there are more apples (like (7,2) and (8,0)).\n\nCheck for head-on collision risk: enemy head at (5,3) is 3 steps away from (4,6) (Manhattan distance |5-4| + |3-6| = 1+3=4). So no immediate risk.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (4,6) is safe, gets us an apple, and avoids the enemy.\n\nPlan for next turns: After eating at (4,6), we should consider moving LEFT to (3,6) or RIGHT to (5,6) to avoid staying in place. From there, we can head towards (3,4) or (6,7). We should also monitor enemy movement.\n\nFinal move: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Your body: [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)] (length 13, since you ate an apple last turn). You now have 12 apples (so length 13).\n\nApples at: (7,2), (8,0), (6,7), (3,4), (9,9) [Note: (4,6) was eaten last turn, so removed]\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (5,2) and body: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)] (length 13, since it has 12 apples). Both snakes are now equal in length.\n\nNow, check each direction from your head (4,6):\n- UP: (4,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment is (4,7)). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (4,5) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (2,5) but not (4,5)). Not enemy body (enemy body is at y>=3). Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (3,7) and (2,6), but not (3,6)). Not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Not enemy body (enemy head is at (5,2), body at (5,3) etc.). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (3,4) is close (2 steps LEFT and 2 DOWN).\n- Apple at (6,7) is close (2 steps RIGHT and 1 UP).\n- Apple at (7,2) is farther (3 steps RIGHT and 4 DOWN).\n- Apple at (8,0) is farther (4 steps RIGHT and 6 DOWN).\n- Apple at (9,9) is farthest (5 steps RIGHT and 3 UP).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (5,2). It might be heading towards (3,4) or (7,2). Since it is at (5,2), it could go DOWN to (5,1) or (5,0) for (8,0), LEFT to (4,2) for (3,4), or RIGHT to (6,2) for (7,2). We should avoid head-on collisions.\n\nFrom (4,6), moving LEFT to (3,6) gets us closer to (3,4). Moving RIGHT to (5,6) gets us closer to (6,7). Moving DOWN to (4,5) doesn't directly get us closer to any apple but avoids enemy and opens options.\n\nCheck for head-on collision risk: enemy head at (5,2) is 4 steps away from (4,6) (Manhattan |5-4| + |2-6| = 1+4=5). So no immediate risk.\n\nHowever, we should consider future moves. Moving LEFT to (3,6) might lead to (3,5) and then (3,4) to eat the apple. But note that enemy might also be going for (3,4). Since enemy is at (5,2), it can go LEFT to (4,2) and then (3,2) and then (3,3) and (3,4) in 3 moves. We are at (4,6), so to (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) in 3 moves. So we are equally close. But if we move LEFT, we might risk head-on collision at (3,4) in future.\n\nSimilarly, moving RIGHT to (5,6) gets us to (6,6) and then (6,7) in 2 moves. Enemy is farther from (6,7).\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,5) is safe and gives us more options: from (4,5), we can go LEFT to (3,5) or RIGHT to (5,5) or DOWN to (4,4). This avoids potential conflict with enemy.\n\nGiven that enemy is at (5,2) and might move towards (3,4), it might be safer to avoid that area and go for (6,7) or (7,2). Also, (9,9) is too far.\n\nPlan for next turns: After this move, we should aim for (6,7) or (7,2). Moving RIGHT now sets us on that path. Alternatively, moving DOWN keeps us safe and away from enemy.\n\nSince we are equal in length with enemy, we should avoid risky encounters and focus on eating apples safely.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (5,6) is good to get closer to (6,7). From (5,6), we can go UP to (5,7) or RIGHT to (6,6) next turn.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (4,7) but not (5,7)). Not enemy body (enemy body is at y<=8 and x<=9, but (5,7) is clear). Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,5) - Within board? Yes.

We should avoid head-on collisions.\n\nFrom (5,6), moving RIGHT to (6,6) gets us closer to (6,7) and (7,2). Moving UP to (5,7) also gets us closer to (6,7). Moving DOWN to (5,5) doesn't directly get us closer to any apple but avoids enemy.\n\nCheck for head-on collision risk: enemy head at (6,2) is 4 steps away from (5,6) (Manhattan |6-5| + |2-6| = 1+4=5). So no immediate risk.\n\nHowever, we should consider future moves. Moving RIGHT to (6,6) might lead to (6,7) next turn to eat the apple. But note that enemy is at (6,2) and might move UP to (6,3) or (6,4), which is not directly conflicting with (6,7).\n\nMoving UP to (5,7) also gets us closer to (6,7): from (5,7) we can go RIGHT to (6,7) next turn.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,5) is safe but doesn't progress towards any apple quickly.\n\nGiven that (6,7) is very close and we can potentially eat it next turn, we should prioritize that. Both UP and RIGHT are good for that.\n\nBut note: if we move RIGHT to (6,6), we are adjacent to (6,7). Next turn, we can go UP to (6,7) to eat the apple. However, we must check if enemy might interfere? Enemy is at (6,2) and is unlikely to reach (6,7) in one move.\n\nSimilarly, if we move UP to (5,7), we are also adjacent to (6,7) and can go RIGHT next turn.\n\nWhich one is safer? Check the board after move:\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (6,6): then our head is at (6,6). Our body will be [ (5,6), (4,6), ... ]. The enemy snake #0 is at (6,2) and might move to (6,3) or (7,2) etc. No conflict.\n\nIf we move UP to (5,7): our head at (5,7), body [ (5,6), (4,6), ... ]. Also safe.\n\nBoth are safe. However, moving RIGHT to (6,6) might be slightly better because it opens the possibility to go UP to (6,7) or RIGHT to (7,6) or DOWN to (6,5) next turn. Moving UP to (5,7) might limit our options: from (5,7) we can go RIGHT to (6,7), LEFT to (4,7) (but (4,7) is our body), or DOWN to (5,6) (which is our body). So only RIGHT is safe from (5,7). Therefore, moving RIGHT gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is better.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving to (6,6), we can go UP to (6,7) to eat the apple if it is still there. Then we can continue towards other apples like (7,2) or (9,9). Avoid enemy snake #0 which is in the lower right.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Your body: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)] (length 13, since you have 12 apples). The tail is at (2,0).\n\nApples at: (8,0), (6,7), (3,4), (9,9), (2,8)\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (7,2) and body: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8)] (length 14, since it has 13 apples).\n\nNow, check each direction from your head (6,6):\n- UP: (6,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (4,7) and (3,7) but not (6,7)). Not enemy body (enemy body has (8,7) and (9,7) but not (6,7)). Also, there is an apple at (6,7)! So moving UP would eat the apple.\n- DOWN: (6,5) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (2,5) but not (6,5)). Enemy body: enemy has (6,5) in its body! So moving DOWN would hit enemy snake #0's body and die. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment after head is (5,6)). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Enemy body: enemy has (8,6) but not (7,6). So safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (6,7) is directly UP. We can eat it immediately.\n- Apple at (9,9) is far (3 steps RIGHT and 3 UP).\n- Apple at (8,0) is far (2 steps RIGHT and 6 DOWN, but DOWN is unsafe).\n- Apple at (3,4) is close (3 steps LEFT and 2 DOWN, but LEFT is unsafe).\n- Apple at (2,8) is close (4 steps LEFT and 2 UP, but LEFT is unsafe).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7,2). It might be heading towards (8,0) or (3,4) or (2,8). Since it is at (7,2), it could go DOWN to (7,1) or (7,0) for (8,0), LEFT to (6,2) for (3,4), or UP to (7,3) for (2,8). We should avoid head-on collisions.\n\nFrom (6,6), moving UP to (6,7) eats the apple immediately. This is highly beneficial. Moving RIGHT to (7,6) does not eat an apple but might lead to (7,7) or (8,6) etc.\n\nCheck for head-on collision risk: enemy head at (7,2) is 4 steps away (Manhattan |7-6| + |2-6| = 1+4=5). So no immediate risk.\n\nHowever, note that moving UP to (6,7) eats the apple. This will grow our snake by one segment. The new tail will be the same as before (since we grow), so our body will be [ (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), ... , (2,0) ] (length 14). This is safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,6) is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n\nWhich one is safer? Both are safe. But UP gives immediate apple. Also, after eating the apple at (6,7), we will have more options: from (6,7) we can go LEFT to (5,7) (but (5,7) is our body? Wait, check: our body after move would have (6,6) and (5,6) and (4,7) etc. (5,7) is currently in our body (index 2: (4,7) is third segment? Actually, after eating, the tail doesn't drop, so the body becomes [ (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), ... ]). So (5,7) is still in our body? Actually, (5,7) is not in the new body? The current body has (4,7) but not (5,7). So from (6,7), LEFT to (5,7) would be safe? But wait, we need to check: after moving UP, our body includes (6,6) and (5,6) and (4,6) and (4,7) etc. So (5,7) is not occupied. So from (6,7), we can go LEFT to (5,7), RIGHT to (7,7), or DOWN to (6,6) (but (6,6) is our body). So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe from (6,7) after eating.\n\nSimilarly, moving RIGHT to (7,6) gives more options: from (7,6) we can go UP to (7,7), DOWN to (7,5) (but enemy has (7,5)? Enemy body has (7,5) - unsafe), or LEFT to (6,6) (our body). So only UP is safe from (7,6). Therefore, moving RIGHT leads to a potential trap.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is clearly better: it eats an apple and gives two safe moves next turn (LEFT or RIGHT). Moving RIGHT gives only one safe move (UP) and no apple.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (6,7), we can consider moving towards (9,9) or (2,8). Avoid enemy snake #0 which is in the lower right. Also, note that enemy has 13 apples, we will have 13 after this move, so we are tied. We need to collect more apples to win.\n\nFinal move: UP\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nTurn 45, your snake (ID 1) has head at (6,7) (after moving UP last turn). Your body: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)] (length 14, since you ate the apple at (6,7)). The tail is still at (2,0).\n\nApples at: (8,0), (3,4), (9,9), (2,8), (1,0)  [Note: the apple at (6,7) was eaten, so it's gone]\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (7,1) (it moved from (7,2)? Actually, from last turn: enemy head was at (7,2) and it moved to (7,1) [since its body now starts at (7,1) and then (7,2) etc.]). Enemy body: [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8)] (length 14, same apples as before).\n\nNow, check each direction from your head (6,7):\n- UP: (6,8) - Within board? Yes (y=8). Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (4,7) and (3,7) but not (6,8)). Not enemy body (enemy has (8,7) and (9,7) and (9,8) - (9,8) is enemy tail? Actually, enemy body has (9,8) as last segment, so it is occupied. But (6,8) is clear). So safe.\n- DOWN: (6,6) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment is (6,6)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (4,7) but not (5,7)). Not enemy body (enemy has (8,7) but not (5,7)). So safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Enemy body: enemy has (8,7) but not (7,7). So safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (2,8): from (6,7), it is 4 steps LEFT and 1 UP.\n- Apple at (9,9): 3 steps RIGHT and 2 UP.\n- Apple at (3,4): 3 steps LEFT and 3 DOWN (but DOWN is unsafe).\n- Apple at (8,0): 2 steps RIGHT and 7 DOWN (but DOWN is unsafe).\n- Apple at (1,0): 5 steps LEFT and 7 DOWN (unsafe).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7,1). It might be heading towards (8,0) or (1,0) or (3,4). Since it is at (7,1), it could go DOWN to (7,0) for (8,0), LEFT to (6,1) for (3,4) or (1,0), or UP to (7,2) (but that is its own body). We should avoid head-on collisions.\n\nFrom (6,7), moving UP to (6,8) doesn't eat an apple but opens up more space. Moving LEFT to (5,7) doesn't eat an apple. Moving RIGHT to (7,7) doesn't eat an apple.\n\nHowever, we should consider the next moves. For example:\n- If we go UP to (6,8), next turn we can go LEFT to (5,8), RIGHT to (7,8), or UP to (6,9) (but not DOWN to (6,7) since it will be body? Actually, after moving UP, our body becomes [ (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), ... ] so (6,7) is occupied. So from (6,8), safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT, UP? Check (6,9): not occupied. So three moves.\n- If we go LEFT to (5,7), next turn we can go UP to (5,8), DOWN to (5,6) (but (5,6) is our body), or LEFT to (4,7) (but (4,7) is our body). So only UP is safe from (5,7). This is restrictive.\n- If we go RIGHT to (7,7), next turn we can go UP to (7,8), DOWN to (7,6) (but enemy has (7,5) and (7,6) is free? Actually, enemy has (7,5) and (7,2) but not (7,6). However, (7,6) is adjacent to enemy head? Enemy head at (7,1) is far. So (7,6) is safe? But we must check: from (7,7), DOWN to (7,6) is free. Also RIGHT to (8,7) (enemy has (8,7) - unsafe), LEFT to (6,7) (our body). So only UP and DOWN are safe from (7,7). So two moves.\n\nTherefore, moving UP gives the most options (three) for next turn. Moving LEFT gives only one safe move (UP), and moving RIGHT gives two (UP and DOWN).\n\nAlso, we should consider the direction towards apples. The closest apple is (2,8) (5 steps Manhattan) or (9,9) (5 steps). But (2,8) is to the left, and (9,9) to the right. Since we have more options if we go UP, we can then decide to go left or right.\n\nLong-term plan: We are tied with enemy at 13 apples each. We need to collect apples to win. The apples at (2,8) and (9,9) are the most reachable. Also, note that enemy is at (7,1) and might be going for (8,0) or (1,0). We should avoid the enemy's path. Moving UP now gives us flexibility to go either left or right next turn. From (6,8), we can go LEFT towards (2,8) or RIGHT towards (9,9). We should assess which apple is safer to go for. Also, note that enemy might be heading to (8,0), so (9,9) might be contested. Perhaps (2,8) is safer? But we can decide next turn.\n\nFor now, UP is the best move to maintain options.\n\nFinal move: UP\n\nUP",

Not enemy body (enemy has no (5,8)). So safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body. Enemy body: enemy has (8,7) but not (7,8). So safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (2,8): from (6,8), it is 4 steps LEFT.\n- Apple at (9,9): 3 steps RIGHT and 1 UP.\n- Apple at (3,4): 3 steps LEFT and 4 DOWN (but DOWN is unsafe).\n- Apple at (8,0): 2 steps RIGHT and 8 DOWN (unsafe).\n- Apple at (1,0): 5 steps LEFT and 8 DOWN (unsafe).\n\nThe closest apples are (2,8) and (9,9). (2,8) is directly left, and (9,9) is right and up.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,1). It might be heading towards (8,0) or (1,0). Since it is at (8,1), it could go DOWN to (8,0) to eat the apple, LEFT to (7,1) (but that is its own body), or UP to (8,2) (free). So likely it will go DOWN to (8,0) or UP to (8,2). This means the apple at (9,9) might be uncontested for now, while (2,8) is also free.\n\nFrom (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8) gets us closer to (2,8). Moving RIGHT to (7,8) gets us closer to (9,9). Moving UP to (6,9) doesn't directly help but opens options.\n\nNow, consider next moves:\n- If we go UP to (6,9): next turn, we can go LEFT to (5,9), RIGHT to (7,9), or DOWN to (6,8) (but (6,8) will be body). So safe: LEFT and RIGHT. Also, we are adjacent to (9,9) from (7,9) next turn.\n- If we go LEFT to (5,8): next turn, we can go UP to (5,9), LEFT to (4,8), or DOWN to (5,7) (but (5,7) is free? Check: your body has (4,7) and (3,7) but not (5,7). Enemy has no (5,7). So safe. So three moves: UP, LEFT, DOWN.\n- If we go RIGHT to (7,8): next turn, we can go UP to (7,9), RIGHT to (8,8) (free), or DOWN to (7,7) (free). So three moves.\n\nAll safe moves give good options next turn. However, moving LEFT directly towards (2,8) is efficient. Moving RIGHT towards (9,9) is also good. Moving UP delays the decision.\n\nSince we are tied with the enemy at 13 apples, we should prioritize eating an apple quickly. (2,8) is 4 steps away via LEFT moves, and (9,9) is 3 steps away via RIGHT and UP. But note: (9,9) requires moving RIGHT then UP, which is two moves. Similarly, (2,8) requires four LEFT moves.\n\nActually, from (6,8) to (2,8): Manhattan distance is 4. To (9,9): Manhattan distance is 4 (3 right + 1 up). So equally close.\n\nBut moving RIGHT to (7,8) gets us to Manhattan distance 3 from (9,9) (2 right + 1 up) and moving LEFT to (5,8) gets us to Manhattan distance 3 from (2,8) (3 left). So both are good.\n\nHowever, the enemy is on the right side (head at (8,1)) and might move towards (9,9) later. But currently, it is far and likely going for (8,0). So (9,9) might be safer to go for? Alternatively, (2,8) is on our left where we have a long body, so it might be safer from enemy interference.\n\nGiven that, both are viable. But to be efficient, we should choose a direction that moves us towards one apple.\n\nLet's choose LEFT to go for (2,8), as it is directly left and we can avoid the enemy area.\n\nAlso, note that from (5,8), we have three safe moves next turn, which is good.\n\nSo move LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan: We are going for the apple at (2,8). After eating it, we can consider other apples like (3,4) or (1,0), but avoid the enemy which is likely in the bottom right. We should also be cautious of head-on collisions with the enemy if it comes up.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nTurn 47, your snake (ID 1) has head at (5,8) (after moving LEFT last turn). Your body: [(6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)] (length 14, since you didn't eat an apple last turn). The tail is at (2,2).\n\nApples at: (3,4), (9,9), (2,8), (1,0), (3,9)\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (8,0) and body: [(8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7)] (length 15, since it ate the apple at (8,0) last turn? Because its head was at (8,1) and it moved DOWN to (8,0) to eat the apple. So it grew to 15 segments.)\n\nNow, check each direction from your head (5,8):\n- UP: (5,9) - Within board? Yes (y=9). Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (5,6) but not (5,9)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (5,9)). So safe.\n- DOWN: (5,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (4,7) and (3,7) but not (5,7)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (5,7)). So safe.\n- LEFT: (4,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (4,6) and (4,7) but not (4,8)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (4,8)). So safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment is (6,8)). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (2,8): from (5,8), it is 3 steps LEFT.\n- Apple at (3,9): 2 steps LEFT and 1 UP.\n- Apple at (3,4): 2 steps LEFT and 4 DOWN.\n- Apple at (9,9): 4 steps RIGHT and 1 UP (but RIGHT is unsafe).\n- Apple at (1,0): 4 steps LEFT and 8 DOWN.\n\nThe closest apples are (2,8) and (3,9). (2,8) is directly left, and (3,9) is left and up.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8,0). It might move UP to (8,1) (but that is its body), LEFT to (7,0) (free), or RIGHT to (9,0) (off board? x=9 is valid, y=0). So likely LEFT or RIGHT. It might also consider going UP to (8,1) if it wants to avoid dying, but that is its body so it won't. So safe moves for enemy: LEFT to (7,0) or RIGHT to (9,0). So it will probably go LEFT to (7,0) or RIGHT to (9,0). This means it is not a direct threat to us in the top left.\n\nFrom (5,8), moving LEFT to (4,8) gets us closer to (2,8) and (3,9). Moving DOWN to (5,7) doesn't help much. Moving UP to (5,9) is good for (3,9) but not directly for (2,8).\n\nSo best to move LEFT towards the apples.\n\nNext moves after:\n- If we go LEFT to (4,8): next turn, we can go UP to (4,9), LEFT to (3,8), or DOWN to (4,7). All should be safe (check: (4,7) is your body? Currently (4,7) is your body segment. But next turn, your body will be [(5,8), (6,8), ...] and the tail moves forward? Since we didn't eat an apple, the tail moves. So (4,7) will no longer be body? Actually, your current tail is (2,2). After moving LEFT to (4,8), the head becomes (4,8), and the body becomes [(5,8), (6,8), (6,7), ...] and the tail (2,2) moves to (2,3)? Wait no: when you move without eating, the head moves to new cell, each segment shifts, and the tail is removed. So the new body will be: head (4,8), then (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). So (4,7) is still in the body? Actually, (4,7) is the 8th segment. So it remains. Therefore, DOWN to (4,7) would be unsafe next turn. But LEFT to (3,8) and UP to (4,9) are safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go UP to (5,9): next turn, we can go LEFT to (4,9), RIGHT to (6,9) (but (6,9) might be free? Your new body won't have (6,9)), or DOWN to (5,8) (which will be body). So safe: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,7): next turn, we can go LEFT to (4,7) (unsafe, as it is body), RIGHT to (6,7) (unsafe, body), DOWN to (5,6) (unsafe, body), or UP to (5,8) (body). So no safe moves next turn if we go DOWN. Therefore, DOWN is a dead end and should be avoided.\n\nSo only UP and LEFT are safe and keep options open.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, LEFT is better because it directly moves towards the apples (2,8) and (3,9). Also, from (4,8) we have two safe moves next turn (LEFT and UP), which is good.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving left to eat the apple at (2,8) or (3,9). After that, consider the apple at (3,4) or (1,0), but be cautious of the enemy which is in the bottom right. Avoid moving into areas with no escape.\n\nLEFT",

I ate apple last turn, so I grow by 1, tail stays at (9, 7) this turn. Next turn tail moves to (8, 7) if I move normally. So (6, 1) could be safe next turn if I go LEFT now and then UP later.  \n\nRIGHT (9, 0):  \n- Next turn only (9, 1) safe.  \n- From (9, 1), possible moves: UP (9, 2) empty, LEFT (8, 1) body? (8, 1) will be body next turn? Yes, my body from last head at (8, 0) will be at (8, 1) next turn if I move RIGHT now. So from (9, 1) next turn, UP (9, 2) safe, DOWN (9, 0) body, LEFT (8, 1) body, RIGHT off board. So again only 1 safe move (UP).  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better because after (6, 0) I might have more options (UP to 6,1 or LEFT to 5,0).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy movement**  \nEnemy could go for (2, 8) or (3, 9) apples, far from me. No immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI need to avoid being trapped. My long body blocks top right area. Moving LEFT along bottom row may give more space in bottom-left area later.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 0), go LEFT to (6, 0). Then assess: possibly UP to (6, 1) if safe, to start coiling toward center. Avoid moving into my own body above.  \n\nLEFT",

The tail is at (2,3).\n\nApples at: (3,4), (9,9), (2,8), (1,0), (3,9)\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (7,0) and body: [(8,0), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7)] (length 15).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (4,8):\n- UP: (4,9) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (4,6) and (4,7) but not (4,9)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (4,9)). So safe.\n- DOWN: (4,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (segment at (4,7)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (3,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (3,7) but not (3,8)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (3,8)). So safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment is (5,8)). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (2,8): from (4,8), it is 2 steps LEFT.\n- Apple at (3,9): 1 step LEFT and 1 UP.\n- Apple at (3,4): 1 step LEFT and 4 DOWN (but DOWN is unsafe).\n- Apple at (9,9): 5 steps RIGHT and 1 UP (but RIGHT is unsafe).\n- Apple at (1,0): 3 steps LEFT and 8 DOWN (DOWN unsafe).\n\nThe closest apples are (2,8) and (3,9). Both are best reached by moving LEFT.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7,0). It might move UP to (7,1) (its body), LEFT to (6,0) (free), or RIGHT to (8,0) (its body). So only safe move is LEFT to (6,0). It is far away and not a threat.\n\nNext moves after:\n- If we go LEFT to (3,8): next turn, we can go UP to (3,9) (apple), LEFT to (2,8) (apple), or DOWN to (3,7) (your body). So safe: UP and LEFT.\n- If we go UP to (4,9): next turn, we can go LEFT to (3,9) (apple), RIGHT to (5,9) (free), or DOWN to (4,8) (which will be body). So safe: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nBoth moves are good, but LEFT is better because it directly moves towards two apples and gives us two safe options next turn (including eating an apple at (3,9) or (2,8)).\n\nLong-term plan: Move LEFT to (3,8) this turn. Next turn, if apple at (3,9) is still there, consider UP to eat it. Otherwise, move LEFT to (2,8) to eat that apple. After eating, we will have grown and need to avoid trapping ourselves. The enemy is far away, so focus on collecting apples in the top-left region.\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s check:  \nMy body after moving LEFT:  \nNew head (6, 0), then old head (7, 0) becomes body segment 1, then (8, 0) becomes segment 2, etc. Tail at (8, 7) will move to (8, 6) next turn if no apple eaten.  \n\nSo next turn from (6, 0):  \nUP (6, 1): currently empty, no body there next turn (my body at (6, 2) stays at (6, 2) unless I eat apple \u2014 I won\u2019t eat apple this turn). So (6, 1) will be safe next turn.  \nDOWN off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (5, 0): empty now, will be safe next turn.  \nRIGHT (7, 0): will be my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo next turn from (6, 0), safe moves: UP, LEFT (2 safe moves).

Need to be careful not to trap myself in bottom-left corner.  \nFrom (6, 0), next turn I can go UP to (6, 1) to avoid being stuck on bottom row with only one exit.  \nEnemy is far away, not an immediate threat.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 0), prefer UP to (6, 1) to gain space, then possibly move toward center or left to get apple (1, 0) later. Avoid going LEFT to (5, 0) immediately unless necessary, because that reduces future options.  \n\nLEFT",

Your body: [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)] (length 14, since you didn't eat an apple last turn). The tail is at (2,4).\n\nApples at: (3,4), (9,9), (2,8), (1,0), (3,9)\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (6,0) and body: [(7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6)] (length 15).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (3,8):\n- UP: (3,9) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (3,7) but not (3,9)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (3,9)). Also, there is an apple at (3,9). So safe and leads to apple.\n- DOWN: (3,7) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (segment at (3,7)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (2,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (2,7) and (2,6) but not (2,8)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (2,8)). Also, there is an apple at (2,8). So safe and leads to apple.\n- RIGHT: (4,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment is (4,8)). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT. Both lead to apples.\n\nNow, consider the enemy snake #0 at (6,0). It might move UP to (6,1) (free), DOWN to (6,-1) (off board, unsafe), LEFT to (5,0) (free), or RIGHT to (7,0) (its body). So safe moves: UP and LEFT. It is far away and not a threat.\n\nNext moves after:\n- If we go UP to (3,9): we eat the apple. Then our head is at (3,9) and we grow to length 15. Next turn, from (3,9), we can go LEFT to (2,9) (free), RIGHT to (4,9) (free), or DOWN to (3,8) (which will be body? After eating, our body will be [(3,8), (4,8), ...] so (3,8) is body). So safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n- If we go LEFT to (2,8): we eat the apple. Then our head is at (2,8) and we grow to length 15. Next turn, from (2,8), we can go UP to (2,9) (free), LEFT to (1,8) (free), or DOWN to (2,7) (your body). So safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nBoth moves are excellent because they immediately eat an apple. However, going UP to (3,9) might be slightly better because it leaves us at the top edge, which has more open space (right and left) compared to going LEFT to (2,8) which is near the left edge. Also, after eating at (3,9), we can consider moving RIGHT to (4,9) to explore the top row, which has no obstacles and another apple at (9,9) eventually. Alternatively, we can go LEFT to (2,9) and then down to (2,8) if needed.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (3,9), we should move RIGHT along the top row to collect the apple at (9,9) while avoiding the enemy. The enemy is at the bottom and likely moving up, so we should stay in the top half. Alternatively, we can also go left to (2,9) and then down to (2,8) if the apple is still there (but it might be eaten by us this turn if we choose LEFT). Since both moves are safe and beneficial, but UP gives more options for future movement along the top, I choose UP.\n\nUP",

My body after moving LEFT: head (5, 0), then (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), etc. Tail at (8, 6) moves to (8, 5) if no apple eaten. So (5, 1) safe.  \nDOWN off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (4, 0): empty now, safe next turn.  \nRIGHT (6, 0): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT (2 options).

Actually, no \u2014 because the snake moves forward, each segment moves into the previous segment\u2019s position. Let\u2019s simulate:  \nHead goes from (6,0) to (6,1).  \nSegment 1 (old head at (6,0)) moves to (6,0) \u2014 no, that\u2019s wrong: actually, segment 1 is current (7,0), which moves to (6,0) (old head position). Segment 2 (8,0) moves to (7,0), etc. So (6,2) in the new body list is actually the old (7,2) moving to (7,2)? Wait, let\u2019s list clearly:  \n\nCurrent: H(6,0), B1(7,0), B2(8,0), B3(8,1), B4(7,1), B5(7,2), B6(6,2), B7(5,2), ...  \n\nMove UP:  \nNew head: (6,1)  \nNew B1: old H (6,0)  \nNew B2: old B1 (7,0)  \nNew B3: old B2 (8,0)  \nNew B4: old B3 (8,1)  \nNew B5: old B4 (7,1)  \nNew B6: old B5 (7,2)  \nNew B7: old B6 (6,2)  \nNew B8: old B7 (5,2)  \n\nSo (6,2) is occupied next turn by B7. So UP from (6,1) to (6,2) is unsafe next turn.  \n\nCheck next turn from (6,1):  \nUP (6,2): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (6,0): occupied by my body (B1) \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (5,1): empty now, will be safe next turn.  \nRIGHT (7,1): occupied by my body (B5) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo only LEFT is safe next turn if I go UP now. That\u2019s risky \u2014 only one safe move next turn.\n\nIf I go LEFT now to (5,0), next turn from (5,0) we saw UP and LEFT safe (2 options). So LEFT now gives more options next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI need to avoid getting trapped. Currently, going UP leads to only one safe move next turn (LEFT), which could be dangerous. Going LEFT now gives two safe moves next turn.  \nAlso, enemy is far away, so immediate danger is low.  \nApple (1,0) is far left; moving LEFT gets closer but I should not rush into corner. Next turn from (5,0) I can go UP to (5,1) to avoid bottom-row trap.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT keeps more options open next turn and moves toward closest apple while avoiding a potential trap next turn if I go UP now.\n\nLEFT",

Your body: [(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)] and the new head is at (3,9). The tail is still at (2,4) for now (will grow next turn).\n\nApples at: (3,4), (9,9), (2,8), (1,0), (3,6) [Note: (3,9) was eaten last turn, so it's removed. But (3,6) is now listed? Actually, the apples are given as (3,4), (9,9), (2,8), (1,0), (3,6) - so (3,6) is a new apple? Wait, in the previous turn, apples were (3,4), (9,9), (2,8), (1,0), (3,9). So (3,9) is replaced by (3,6)? Possibly.]\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (5,0) and body: [(6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5)] (length 14? Actually, it has 14 segments? But it collected 14 apples, so length should be 15? Wait, the body list has 14 segments plus head? Typically, the head is separate. The enemy body has 14 segments, so total length is 15 (head + 14 body segments). Similarly, your snake has 14 body segments and head, so length 15.\n\nNow, check each direction from your head (3,9):\n- UP: (3,10) - Off the board (y=10 not allowed). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (3,8) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: your own body (first segment is (3,8)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (2,9) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (2,7), (2,6), etc. but not (2,9)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (2,9)). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,9) - Within board? Yes. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (4,8), (4,7), etc. but not (4,9)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (4,9)). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (2,8) is close: if we go LEFT to (2,9), then next turn we can go DOWN to (2,8) to eat it (if still there).\n- Apple at (9,9) is far: we need to go RIGHT multiple times.\n- Apple at (3,6) is below, but we cannot go down directly.\n- Apple at (3,4) is even lower.\n- Apple at (1,0) is far.\n\nAlso, enemy snake #0 is at (5,0). It might move UP to (5,1), LEFT to (4,0), or RIGHT to (6,0) (which is its body). So safe moves: UP and LEFT. It is moving away from us.\n\nLong-term plan: We are at the top row. We should traverse along the top to collect the apple at (9,9). Going RIGHT directly towards (9,9) is good. Alternatively, going LEFT to (2,9) might allow us to get the apple at (2,8) next, but that might be riskier because we are near the left edge and might get trapped. Also, after going LEFT to (2,9), we can only go DOWN to (2,8) (to eat the apple) or RIGHT to (3,9) (which is body), so only one safe move next turn? Actually, from (2,9), we can also go LEFT to (1,9) if available? But (1,9) is free.\n\nCompare:\n- If we go RIGHT to (4,9): next turn from (4,9), we can go RIGHT to (5,9), LEFT to (3,9) (body), or DOWN to (4,8) (body). So only one safe move: RIGHT. Then we can continue right along the top.\n- If we go LEFT to (2,9): next turn from (2,9), we can go LEFT to (1,9) (free), RIGHT to (3,9) (body), or DOWN to (2,8) (free, and apple). So two safe moves: LEFT and DOWN.\n\nSo going LEFT gives more options next turn (two moves) while going RIGHT gives only one. Also, going LEFT allows us to potentially eat the apple at (2,8) soon.\n\nHowever, the enemy is far away, so both are safe. But to maximize future options, LEFT is better because it gives two choices next turn. Also, we can then go down to (2,8) to eat the apple, and then we have more space to maneuver on the left side.\n\nBut note: the apple at (2,8) might be eaten by the enemy? Unlikely, since the enemy is at the bottom.\n\nI think LEFT is better for now.\n\nPlan: Go LEFT to (2,9). Next turn, if the apple at (2,8) is still there, go DOWN to eat it. Otherwise, go LEFT to (1,9) to explore the top left corner. This will keep us safe and allow growth.\n\nSo choose LEFT.\nLEFT",

Both are far from me.

Tail at (8, 5) moves to (8, 5)? Wait, no apple eaten, so tail moves forward: last segment (8, 5) disappears, new tail is (7, 5). So (4, 1) is safe next turn.  \nLEFT (3, 0): empty now, safe next turn.  \nDOWN off board.  \nRIGHT (5, 0): my body (B1) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT (2 options).  \n\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 1):  \nNext turn from (5, 1):  \nUP (5, 2): my body currently at (5, 2), but after moving UP, body shifts: new body: (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5).  \nSo (5, 2) is occupied next turn (by old (5, 2) moving to (5, 2)? Wait, check:  \nCurrent: H(5,0), B1(6,0), B2(7,0), B3(8,0), B4(8,1), B5(7,1), B6(7,2), B7(6,2), B8(5,2), B9(5,3), B10(6,3), B11(6,4), B12(6,5), B13(7,5), B14(8,5).  \n\nMove UP:  \nNew head: (5,1)  \nNew B1: old H (5,0)  \nNew B2: old B1 (6,0)  \nNew B3: old B2 (7,0)  \nNew B4: old B3 (8,0)  \nNew B5: old B4 (8,1)  \nNew B6: old B5 (7,1)  \nNew B7: old B6 (7,2)  \nNew B8: old B7 (6,2)  \nNew B9: old B8 (5,2)  \nNew B10: old B9 (5,3)  \nNew B11: old B10 (6,3)  \nNew B12: old B11 (6,4)  \nNew B13: old B12 (6,5)  \nNew B14: old B13 (7,5)  \nTail (old B14 (8,5)) gone.  \n\nSo (5,2) is occupied by B9. So UP from (5,1) to (5,2) is unsafe.  \nDOWN (5,0): occupied by B1 \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (4,1): empty now, safe next turn.  \nRIGHT (6,1): empty now, safe next turn.  \n\nSo next turn from (5,1) safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\nActually both LEFT and UP now give 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nGoing UP opens more space vertically, moving away from bottom edge. Going LEFT moves toward apple (1,0) but bottom row is cramped.  \nGiven enemy is far away, I should prioritize keeping space. UP seems better for long-term mobility.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Check immediate apple reach**  \nNo apple is immediately adjacent, so no urgent apple grab.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gives more future flexibility and avoids bottom row trap.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,1), likely choose LEFT or RIGHT to avoid my body, aim toward center or apple (3,4).  \n\nUP",

Your body is [(3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5)] (length 15). The tail is at (2,5).\n\nApples at: (3,4), (9,9), (2,8), (1,0), (3,6)\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (5,1) and body: [(5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5)] (length 15).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (2,9):\n- UP: (2,10) - Off the board (y=10 not allowed). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (2,8) - Within board. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) but not (2,8)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (2,8)). However, there is an apple at (2,8). Safe.\n- LEFT: (1,9) - Within board. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has no (1,9)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (1,9)). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,9) - Within board. Check for snakes: your body has (3,9) as the first segment. Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (2,8) is directly below you. Going DOWN would eat it immediately.\n- Apple at (9,9) is far, but we are at the top row.\n- Apple at (3,6) is below, but we can reach it later.\n- Apple at (3,4) and (1,0) are also options.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (5,1). It might move UP to (5,2) (which is its body? Actually, (5,2) is in its body), DOWN to (5,0) (body), LEFT to (4,1) (free), or RIGHT to (6,1) (free). So it has safe moves LEFT and RIGHT. It is far from us.\n\nLong-term plan:\nWe are at (2,9). If we go DOWN to (2,8), we eat the apple and grow to length 16. Then our head will be at (2,8) and our body will extend by one segment (so the tail stays at (2,5) for now). This is beneficial for scoring.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2,8), we can then consider moving LEFT to (1,8) or RIGHT to (3,8) (but (3,8) is our body) or DOWN to (2,7) (which is our body). So next turn, from (2,8) after growth, the safe moves would be LEFT (to (1,8)) and possibly DOWN? But (2,7) is body, so only LEFT. So we might get trapped? Actually, after moving DOWN to (2,8) and eating, the body becomes: head at (2,8), then (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), ... and tail at (2,5). So from (2,8), the adjacent cells:\n- UP: (2,9) is body (the segment behind head)\n- DOWN: (2,7) is body\n- LEFT: (1,8) is free\n- RIGHT: (3,8) is body\n\nSo only LEFT is safe. That means we must go LEFT to (1,8) next turn. That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if we go LEFT now to (1,9), we avoid eating the apple immediately and keep options open. From (1,9), next turn we can go DOWN to (1,8) (free) or LEFT to (0,9) (free) or RIGHT to (2,9) (which is our current head position, but will be empty? Actually, after we move, the tail moves? Wait, no growth this turn if we don't eat. So if we go LEFT to (1,9), we don't eat, so the tail (2,5) moves to (2,6)? Actually, the entire snake moves: head to (1,9), each segment moves to the next, and the tail segment is removed. So the body becomes: head at (1,9), then (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), ... up to (2,6) (since tail was at (2,5) and moves to (2,6)). So from (1,9), adjacent cells:\n- UP: (1,10) off board\n- DOWN: (1,8) free\n- LEFT: (0,9) free\n- RIGHT: (2,9) which is now the first body segment (so unsafe)\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. That gives two options.\n\nBut if we go LEFT now, we miss the chance to eat the apple at (2,8) immediately. The enemy might eat it? Unlikely, but possible.\n\nHowever, going DOWN to eat the apple is safe and gives us a point. Even though it forces us to go LEFT next turn, that is acceptable. We can then navigate along the left side.\n\nGiven that we are competing with snake #0 (both have 14 apples), we should prioritize eating apples to get ahead. So eating the apple at (2,8) is good.\n\nTherefore, choose DOWN.\n\nPlan for next turns: After eating at (2,8), we must go LEFT to (1,8). Then from (1,8), we can go DOWN to (1,7) or LEFT to (0,8). We should avoid going back into our body. The left side has space. We can also consider going down to collect the apple at (1,0) eventually.\n\nSo, DOWN.\nDOWN",

You just ate the apple at (2,8), so your snake has grown to length 16. Your body is now: head at (2,8), followed by (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), and tail at (2,5). Note: since you ate, the tail did not move (it remains at (2,5) for now).\n\nApples at: (3,4), (9,9), (1,0), (3,6), (7,6)  [Note: (2,8) is gone]\n\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (4,1) and body: [(5,1), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] (length 15).\n\nCheck each direction from your head (2,8):\n- UP: (2,9) - This is your own body (the segment directly behind your head). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (2,7) - This is your own body (part of the chain). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,8) - Within board. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has no (1,8)). Not enemy body (enemy has no (1,8)). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,8) - This is your own body (the third segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe move is LEFT to (1,8).\n\nThis was expected from last turn's rationale. Now, we must go LEFT.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (1,8), the snake will move without eating (no apple at (1,8)), so the tail will advance: the head moves to (1,8), each segment shifts, and the tail (previously at (2,5)) moves to (2,6). The new body will be: head at (1,8), then (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), and tail at (2,6).\n\nFrom (1,8) next turn, we can consider:\n- UP: (1,9) - free? Currently, after move, (1,9) will be free (since we are moving from (2,8) to (1,8), and (1,9) is not occupied). But check: our body will have (2,9) but not (1,9). So safe.\n- DOWN: (1,7) - free? Not in our body or enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,8) - within board, free.\n- RIGHT: (2,8) - will be our first body segment (so unsafe).\n\nSo next turn, from (1,8), we will have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan:\nWe are now at the left edge. We should navigate along the left side to avoid trapping ourselves. There is an apple at (1,0) at the bottom left, which we can aim for. Also, apples at (3,4) and (3,6) are nearby. We need to avoid the enemy snake #0 which is in the lower right area.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,1). It might move UP to (4,2) (free?), DOWN to (4,0) (free? but (4,0) is not in its body? Actually, its body has (5,0), (6,0), etc., but not (4,0)), LEFT to (3,1) (free), or RIGHT to (5,1) (its own body). So it has safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. It is moving away from us.\n\nWe should plan to go DOWN from (1,8) next turn to start descending towards the apple at (1,0). Alternatively, we could go LEFT to (0,8) and then down the left column. But going DOWN immediately is more direct.\n\nFor now, we have no choice: only LEFT is safe.\n\nSo, move LEFT.\nLEFT",

Wait, check: My body after moving: head to (3, 0), body shifts: (3, 1) becomes (4, 1), (4, 1) becomes (5, 1), etc. So (4, 0) is currently (5, 0) in old body, which will shift to (6, 0). So (4, 0) will be empty. Actually, let\u2019s trace:  \nCurrent body: (4,1), (5,1), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)  \nAfter moving DOWN to (3,0):  \nNew head: (3,0)  \nNew body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3)  \nSo (4,0) is empty.  \nThus from (3,0) next turn:  \nUP (3,1): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (3,-1): off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (2,0): empty.  \nRIGHT (4,0): empty.  \nSo safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (2, 1):  \nNext turn from (2, 1):  \nUP (2, 2): empty now.  \nDOWN (2, 0): empty now.  \nLEFT (1, 1): empty now.  \nRIGHT (3, 1): occupied by B1 (4, 1) after move \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nBoth UP and LEFT give 3 future safe moves, DOWN gives 2.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy head at (1, 8) could move DOWN to (1, 7) or LEFT to (0, 8) or UP to (1, 9). No overlap with my possible moves (3,2), (3,0), (2,1). So no immediate collision risk.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple path safety**  \nApple at (3,4): going UP now is direct path, but need to check if (3,3) or (3,4) will be safe next turn. Enemy far away, so main risk is my own body shifting.  \nApple at (1,0): going LEFT now then DOWN later is possible.  \n\nGiven I\u2019m behind in apples (14 vs 15), I should prioritize getting an apple soon.  \n(3,4) is 3 steps away (UP, UP, UP).  \n(1,0) is 3 steps away (LEFT, LEFT, DOWN) or (LEFT, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nUP seems more straightforward and keeps me central with more space.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nFrom (3,2), next turn go UP to (3,3) if safe, then to (3,4) for apple. Watch enemy movement\u2014they are far top-left. Avoid getting trapped in top row after eating apple.  \n\nUP",

Check: not your body, not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,7) - This is your own body (the last segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan:\nWe are at the left edge.

Currently our tail is at (2,7), and after moving DOWN the tail will advance to (2,7) is gone? Actually, since we didn't eat, the tail moves: the new tail will be at (2,7) is removed? Wait, let's simulate: after moving DOWN to (1,6), the new head is (1,6), followed by (1,7), (1,8), ... and the tail (which was at (2,7)) will be removed.

It did not eat an apple last turn (no apple at (3,3)), so its tail advanced.\n\nCheck each direction from your head (1,6):\n- UP: (1,7) - This is your own body (the segment directly behind your head). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,5) - Within board. Check for snakes: not your body (your body has no (1,5)), not enemy body (enemy has no (1,5)). Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,6) - Within board. Check: not your body, not enemy body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,6) - Within board. Check: not your body (your body has (6,6) but not (2,6)), not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo all moves except UP are safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan:\nWe are descending towards the apple at (1,0). From (1,6), going DOWN to (1,5) is directly towards that apple. Going LEFT to (0,6) is also safe but doesn't progress downward as directly. Going RIGHT to (2,6) moves away from the apple.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (3,3). It might move UP to (3,4) (where there is an apple), DOWN to (3,2) (its own body), LEFT to (2,3), or RIGHT to (4,3). So it has safe moves: UP (to eat apple), LEFT, RIGHT. It is not near us, but if it moves UP to (3,4) it will grow and become longer.\n\nWe should prioritize moving DOWN to (1,5) to get closer to (1,0). This is the most direct path. Also, from (1,5) we can continue DOWN to (1,4), or go LEFT to (0,5), or RIGHT to (2,5). All should be safe next turn.\n\nGoing LEFT to (0,6) is safe but less efficient. Going RIGHT to (2,6) moves away from the target apple and might lead to potential conflicts later.\n\nTherefore, choose DOWN.\n\nPlan for next turns: Continue descending towards (1,0) via DOWN moves when safe. Avoid moving right into the center where the enemy is. If DOWN is blocked, consider LEFT to stay near the edge and then descend.\nDOWN",

But in the given state, enemy has 15 apples? Wait, the board state shows enemy head at (3,4) and it has 15 apples. So it did not eat? Actually, the board state shows an apple at (3,6) but not at (3,4). So enemy moved to (3,4) which had an apple? But the score says 15 for enemy.

Enemy at (1, 5) can\u2019t reach (3, 6) in 1 move.  \nDOWN (3, 4): will be my body after move (old head position) \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (2, 5): empty.  \nRIGHT (4, 5): empty.  \nSo next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (2, 4):  \nNext turn from (2, 4):  \nUP (2, 5): empty.  \nDOWN (2, 3): empty (my body shifts, (2, 3) will be empty).  \nLEFT (1, 4): empty.  \nRIGHT (3, 4): my body after move \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (4, 4):  \nNext turn from (4, 4):  \nUP (4, 5): empty.  \nDOWN (4, 3): empty (my body shifts, (4, 3) empty).  \nLEFT (3, 4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (5, 4): empty.  \nSo next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 future safe moves.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nUP gets me closer to apple (3, 6) next turn, but need to check if enemy could intercept. Enemy at (1, 5) could go RIGHT to (2, 5) this turn, then next turn could go UP to (2, 6) or RIGHT to (3, 5) etc. If I go UP to (3, 5) now, enemy could go RIGHT to (2, 5) now, then next turn enemy could move to (3, 5) if I leave it, but I won\u2019t be there. Actually, if enemy goes RIGHT to (2, 5) now, next turn from (2, 5) enemy could go UP to (2, 6) or RIGHT to (3, 5) \u2014 but (3, 5) will be my old position, empty. So no direct conflict.  \n\nBut if I go UP now to (3, 5), next turn I can go UP to (3, 6) to eat apple, but enemy could also move toward (3, 6) from (2, 5) by going RIGHT then UP? Let\u2019s check: enemy at (2, 5) next turn could go RIGHT to (3, 5) or UP to (2, 6). To reach (3, 6) from (2, 5) takes 2 moves. I\u2019ll be at (3, 5) now, then (3, 6) next turn, so I get apple before enemy can.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gives quickest path to an apple while keeping options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP now to (3, 5), next turn go UP to (3, 6) to eat apple unless enemy head is adjacent to (3, 6) then reconsider.  \n\nUP",

Yes, second segment in body list (1, 5). Unsafe.  \n- **DOWN:** (1, 3) \u2014 within board, check bodies: my body has no (1, 3), enemy body list has no (1, 3).

RIGHT to (2, 4) is less safe long-term due to enemy proximity, but not immediately deadly.\n\n**Goal:**  \nTarget apple at (1, 0) is my primary goal (closest apple).  \n**DOWN** moves me closer to it.  \nEnemy seems to be near the middle and another apple at (3, 6); maybe it will go for (3, 6) instead of coming towards me.  \n\n**Long-term planning:**  \nContinue descending towards (1, 0) if possible. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s area (right side).  \nFrom (1, 3), next turn options likely DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.

Try to approach (7, 6) or (7, 5) while keeping distance from enemy head.  \n\nRIGHT",

Unsafe.\n- **DOWN:** (1, 0) \u2014 within board. Check bodies: my body has segments from (1,2) to (6,7) \u2014 no (1,0). Enemy body: no (1,0). However, (1,0) has an apple. Moving here is safe and collects the apple.\n- **LEFT:** (0, 1) \u2014 within board. Not in my body: my body has no (0,1). Enemy body: no (0,1). Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 1) \u2014 within board. Not in my body: my body has no (2,1). Enemy body: no (2,1). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Goal:** The apple at (1,0) is directly below us. Moving DOWN collects it immediately. This brings my apple count to 16 (tying with enemy #0). This is highly desirable.\n\n**Enemy threat:** Enemy head is at (4,5). Manhattan distance to my head (1,1) is |1-4| + |1-5| = 3+4=7. It is far and likely targeting the apples on the right (7,6), (8,6), (7,5). No immediate threat to me.\n\n**Future moves after eating (1,0):**\nAfter moving DOWN to (1,0), I will have grown by 1 segment. The new tail will be the last segment (currently (6,7)), so the body will extend. From (1,0), possible moves:\n- UP: (1,1) \u2014 but this will be occupied by my new body (since I just grew, the tail doesn't move, so the head moves to (1,0) and the body extends: the old head (1,1) becomes the new second segment). So (1,1) becomes body. So UP is unsafe (would hit myself).\n- LEFT: (0,0) \u2014 free (currently no body or enemy).\n- RIGHT: (2,0) \u2014 free (currently no body or enemy).\n\nSo after eating, I can go LEFT or RIGHT. Both are safe exits. I should avoid UP.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n- LEFT (to (0,1)): moves away from the apple and doesn't collect it. Less optimal.\n- RIGHT (to (2,1)): moves away from the apple and doesn't collect it. Less optimal.\n\n**Best move:** DOWN \u2014 collects the apple at (1,0) and is safe. This ties the score (16-16) and sets me up for future moves.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter collecting (1,0), I will be at (1,0) with 16 apples. I must then choose LEFT to (0,0) or RIGHT to (2,0). I should consider which direction gives better access to other apples (like (9,9) or the ones on the right). The enemy is on the right, so moving RIGHT might be risky. LEFT (to (0,0)) is a corner, but from there I can go UP to (0,1) (which should be free) to escape. Alternatively, RIGHT to (2,0) might lead to more open space. I should check the next turn which is safer.\n\nFor now, prioritize collecting the apple.\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- **DOWN:** (1, -1) \u2014 outside board (y=-1 invalid). Dies.\n- **LEFT:** (0, 0) \u2014 within board. Check bodies: my body has segments from (1,1) to (6,7) \u2014 no (0,0). Enemy body: no (0,0). Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 0) \u2014 within board. Not in my body: my body has no (2,0). Enemy body: no (2,0). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Goal:** I just collected the apple at (1,0) last turn (as planned), so now I have 16 apples (tied with enemy). I need to avoid dying and plan to collect more apples.\n\n**Enemy threat:** Enemy head is at (5,5). Manhattan distance to my head (1,0) is |1-5| + |0-5| = 4+5=9. It is far and likely targeting the apples on the right (7,6), (8,6), (7,5). No immediate threat.\n\n**Available apples:** The closest apple is at (0,2) (Manhattan distance |1-0| + |0-2| = 1+2=3). Others are far: (7,6) is 6+6=12, (8,6)=7+6=13, (7,5)=6+5=11, (9,9)=8+9=17.\n\n**Future moves:**\n- If I go LEFT to (0,0), then from there:\n  - UP: (0,1) \u2014 free (not in my body or enemy)\n  - RIGHT: (1,0) \u2014 my current head (will be body next turn? Actually, after I move, my head goes to (0,0), and the body extends: the old head (1,0) becomes the new second segment. So (1,0) becomes body. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n  - DOWN: (0,-1) \u2014 invalid.\n  So only UP is safe from (0,0). This leads to a dead-end? But (0,1) is safe, and from (0,1) I can go UP to (0,2) to get the apple or RIGHT to (1,1) (which is body? But after growth, the body will be [ (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), ... ] so (1,1) is body). So from (0,1), only UP to (0,2) is safe? Actually, check: at (0,1), moves:\n    - UP: (0,2) \u2014 free (apple)\n    - DOWN: (0,0) \u2014 body (since I was at (0,0) previous)\n    - LEFT: (-1,1) invalid\n    - RIGHT: (1,1) \u2014 body (my own)\n  So only UP is safe from (0,1). So going LEFT to (0,0) forces me to go UP to (0,1) next, and then UP to (0,2) to get the apple. This is a clear path to collect (0,2).\n\n- If I go RIGHT to (2,0), then from there:\n  - UP: (2,1) \u2014 free (not in body or enemy)\n  - LEFT: (1,0) \u2014 body (my own)\n  - RIGHT: (3,0) \u2014 free\n  - DOWN: (2,-1) invalid\n  So from (2,0), safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n  This gives more options: I can go UP to (2,1) and then potentially towards the right-side apples (but enemy is there) or go RIGHT to (3,0) to explore bottom.\n\nBut note: the apple at (0,2) is very close and achievable in 2 moves via LEFT path. Also, going RIGHT might lead me into the enemy territory (enemy is at (5,5) and moving around there).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nCollect the apple at (0,2) to get ahead (17 vs 16). Then from (0,2), I can consider escaping to the top-left or moving right cautiously. The enemy has 16 apples and is likely going for the apples at (7,6)/(8,6)/(7,5). So I should avoid direct confrontation.\n\n**Best move:** LEFT to (0,0) to set up the path to (0,2). This is safe and leads directly to the apple in two moves.\n\nLEFT",

But (1,2) is my body? Check: current body has (1,2) as the third segment. After growth, the tail doesn't move, so the body will include (1,2). So RIGHT is unsafe. Similarly, DOWN to (0,1) is body.

Therefore, I must go UP to (0,3) next turn.\n\nTo avoid being trapped in the top-left corner, I should plan to turn right eventually.

Wait, enemy body list: head (0,0), then (1,0) is second segment. So (1,0) is enemy body \u2192 unsafe for enemy.  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP to (0, 1) this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn**  \nMy safe moves: (6, 6), (6, 4), (7, 5).  \nEnemy move: (0, 1).  \nNo overlap.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (9, 9), (7, 6), (8, 6), (7, 5), (0, 2)  \n\nFrom my head (6, 5):  \n- RIGHT (7, 5) is apple.  \n- UP (6, 6) is closer to (7, 6) apple (1 step away from there).  \n- DOWN (6, 4) is away from most apples.  \n\nRIGHT gives immediate apple, which grows me by 1 and scores.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (7, 5) apple:  \nNext turn from (7, 5):  \nUP (7, 6): apple.  \nDOWN (7, 4): empty.  \nLEFT (6, 5): my old head (now body after move) \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (8, 5): empty.  \nSo safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nIf I go **UP** to (6, 6):  \nNext turn from (6, 6):  \nUP (6, 7): empty.  \nDOWN (6, 5): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (5, 6): empty.  \nRIGHT (7, 6): apple.  \nSo safe moves next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (6, 4):  \nNext turn from (6, 4):  \nUP (6, 5): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (6, 3): empty.  \nLEFT (5, 4): empty.  \nRIGHT (7, 4): empty.  \nSo safe moves next turn: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nAll three give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Growth and enemy path**  \nEating apple now (RIGHT) gets me to 17 apples, enemy at 16.  \nEnemy at (0, 0) going to (0, 1) is heading toward apple (0, 2). They\u2019ll get that apple in 2 turns unless I interfere (I can\u2019t from here).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI want to reach 30 apples first. After eating (7, 5), I can consider (7, 6) or (8, 6) next. My body occupies left side, so moving right/up is good.  \n\nRIGHT is immediate apple, no risk of head-on with enemy (far away), and keeps options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 5), if safe, go UP to (7, 6) apple or RIGHT to (8, 5) to avoid trapping myself. Watch enemy progress toward (0, 2).  \n\nRIGHT",

After eating, my head moves to (0,2) and I grow. Check collisions: \n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my own body? Current body: [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), ..., (5,8)]. (0,2) is not in my body (last segment is (5,8)).\n  - Not enemy body? Enemy body: [(6,5), (5,5), ..., (8,1)]. (0,2) not present.\n  - However, enemy head might move here? But enemy is at (7,5), Manhattan distance |0-7|+|2-5|=7+3=10, so unlikely to reach in one move.\n  - Safe to move to (0,2) and eat apple.\n- **DOWN:** (0,0) \u2014 This is my own body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n- **LEFT:** (-1,1) \u2014 Off board (x=-1). Dies.\n- **RIGHT:** (1,1) \u2014 This is my own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo only safe move: UP to (0,2) to collect the apple.\n\n**After collecting (0,2):**\n- I will have 17 apples (tying enemy #0 at 17).\n- My new head will be at (0,2), and my body will extend: the new body becomes [(0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), ..., (5,8)].\n- From (0,2), next turn moves:\n  - UP: (0,3) \u2014 free? Check: not in my extended body (which ends at (5,8)), not enemy body. Safe.\n  - DOWN: (0,1) \u2014 my own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (-1,2) \u2014 off board.

So RIGHT is unsafe.\n  - So only UP is safe next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan after this turn:**\nAfter collecting (0,2) and moving to (0,3) next turn, I need to escape the top-left corner. From (0,3):\n- UP to (0,4) might be safe (if not body).\n- But eventually I need to turn right to avoid being trapped. However, my body blocks right moves at low y-levels.\n- Alternatively, I might go up to (0,9) and then right? But that is risky due to enemy.\n- Enemy has 17 apples and is likely targeting (7,6) or (8,6). They are far away (Manhattan distance from (0,2) to (7,5) is 7+3=10), so no immediate threat.\n\n**This turn:** Only one safe move: UP to (0,2) to collect the apple and tie the score.\n\nUP",

Wait \u2014 my body after moving UP from (8, 6) to (8, 7) will be: head (8, 7), then old head (8, 6) becomes new body segment, then rest of body shifts. So (8, 6) will be my body next turn. So DOWN from (8, 7) is unsafe.  \nLEFT (7, 7): empty.  \nRIGHT (9, 7): empty.  \nSo safe moves next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (8, 5):  \nNext turn from (8, 5):  \nUP (8, 6): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (8, 4): apple.  \nLEFT (7, 5): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (9, 5): empty.  \nSo safe moves next turn: DOWN, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (9, 6):  \nNext turn from (9, 6):  \nUP (9, 7): empty.  \nDOWN (9, 5): empty.  \nLEFT (8, 6): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Growth and enemy path**  \nEnemy is moving to (0, 4), not eating an apple this turn. If I go DOWN to (8, 5), next turn I can eat (8, 4) apple and grow, extending my lead (19 vs 17).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nGoing DOWN now sets me up to eat (8, 4) next turn, then I\u2019ll have to check safety from (8, 4) after growth. My body will be long, but enemy is far away. Need to avoid trapping myself after eating (8, 4) \u2014 from (8, 4) I could go DOWN to (8, 3) or RIGHT to (9, 4) to stay near right side apples (9, 9) and (6, 9).  \n\nUP gives more safe moves next turn but delays apple. Given my lead, safety is key, but apple now is also good. However, DOWN gives apple next turn with only 2 safe moves now \u2014 but one of those safe moves next turn is onto the apple (8, 4), which is safe unless enemy somehow reaches there (impossible in 1 turn).  \n\nActually, check: enemy at (0, 4) after this turn, then next turn enemy could move to (0, 5) apple or elsewhere, but not near (8, 4) in 1 move. So DOWN \u2192 (8, 5) is safe now, and next turn DOWN to (8, 4) apple is safe and grows me.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 5), go DOWN to (8, 4) apple unless something unexpected happens. Then from (8, 4), consider RIGHT to (9, 4) or DOWN to (8, 3) to keep space open.  \n\nDOWN",

However, my body occupies much of the top-left. From (0,6), next turn I can go:\n- UP to (0,7): Currently free? Board shows (0,7) is '.' (row 7 col 0).\n- RIGHT to (1,6): Currently occupied by my body (twelfth segment), but as I move forward, (1,6) might become free? Actually, since I didn't eat an apple this turn, my tail moves forward. My tail is at (3,8) and will move to the next segment? But my body is long, so (1,6) remains occupied for now.\nTherefore, next turn only UP might be safe. I must be cautious to avoid getting trapped. The enemy is far and has a high apple count (20 vs my 18), so I need to catch up. Prioritize moving towards the apple at (0,8) if possible.\n\nUP",

That would grow me by one segment, and my tail won't move, so the path behind me might remain congested. However, after eating, I need to plan an escape from the top-left corner. The apple at (1,9) is also nearby. After (0,8), I can go RIGHT to (1,8) or UP to (0,9). But (0,9) is currently free ('.'), and (1,8) is my body (fifteenth segment). So next turn after UP to (0,8), I should consider UP to (0,9) or RIGHT to (1,8) if it becomes free (but since I ate, my tail doesn't move, so (1,8) remains occupied). Actually, my tail is at (3,9), and when I move without eating, the tail moves forward. But if I eat at (0,8), I grow and the tail stays put. So (1,8) remains occupied. Therefore, from (0,8), only UP to (0,9) might be safe. I need to be cautious and check next turn.\n\nThe enemy has 20 apples (I have 18), so I need to catch up. Prioritize eating the apple at (0,8) safely.\n\nUP",

Therefore, next turn I should go RIGHT to (1,9) to eat the apple. After that, I'll be at (1,9) and grow again. Then I can look for other apples (like (6,9) or (9,9)) or plan an escape route. The enemy is longer (20 apples) and I need to catch up, so eating apples is priority. But I must avoid getting trapped \u2014 after (1,9), I might have options to go DOWN to (1,8) (which might be free by then) or RIGHT to (2,9) (currently my tail, but it will move as I progress). For now, focus on safely moving to (0,9) to set up the apple at (1,9).\n\nUP",

Also leads to eating the apple at (1,9).\n\nSo only safe move: RIGHT to (1,9).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (1,9), I will eat the apple and grow. My head will be at (1,9) and my tail will not move (since I grow). Next turn, from (1,9), I can consider:\n- LEFT to (0,9) \u2014 but that will be my body (second segment) so unsafe.\n- DOWN to (1,8) \u2014 currently my body (eighteenth segment), but it might be safe if my tail moves? Actually, since I grow, my tail stays at (2,8) this turn. So (1,8) is still occupied by my body next turn? Let's see: after moving to (1,9), my body becomes: [head (1,9), then (0,9), (0,8), ... up to (2,8)]. So (1,8) is the third segment? Actually, the current body (before move) has 19 segments. After moving RIGHT to (1,9) and eating, I grow to 20 segments. The new body will be: head (1,9), then (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), ... (0,0), (1,0), ... (1,8), (2,8). So (1,8) is the 20th segment? Wait, let's count: the current body (from head to tail) is 19 segments. After moving, the head goes to (1,9), and we prepend that. Then we remove the tail? But since we eat, we don't remove the tail. So the new body is 20 segments: (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), ... (2,8). So (1,8) is the third segment? Actually, the second segment is (0,9), third is (0,8), ... and (1,8) is the 19th segment? It's messy. But importantly, (1,8) will be occupied by my body next turn. So from (1,9), only RIGHT to (2,9) might be safe? But (2,9) is currently my tail? Actually, current tail is (2,8). After I move, my tail is still (2,8) (since I grow). So (2,9) is free. Also, I could consider UP? (1,10) is off board. So next turn, from (1,9), only RIGHT to (2,9) is safe? But we'll reassess next turn. For now, focus on safely moving to (1,9) to eat the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

UP moves toward (8, 7) (y+1, same x for now). LEFT moves toward (6, 9) and (2, 6) but away from (8, 7).\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\nIf I go **UP** to (7, 2):  \nNext turn from (7, 2):  \nUP (7, 3): empty.  \nDOWN (7, 1): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (6, 2): empty.  \nRIGHT (8, 2): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe moves next turn: UP, LEFT (2 options).\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (7, 0):  \nNext turn from (7, 0):  \nUP (7, 1): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (6, 0): empty.  \nRIGHT (8, 0): empty.  \nSafe moves next turn: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options) but stuck on bottom edge.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (6, 1):  \nNext turn from (6, 1):  \nUP (6, 2): empty.  \nDOWN (6, 0): empty.  \nLEFT (5, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe (tail at (5,1)? Wait, my body ends at (5,1) currently, but after moving, tail moves? Actually, snake grows only if eats apple. No apple eaten this turn, so tail stays at (5,1) for next turn? Let's check: my body length is 20 segments (head + 19 body). Apples collected: 20, so length = 20+1? No, in Snake, length = initial + apples eaten. Starting length unknown, but given apples=20, length likely 21. My listed body has 20 coords including head? Wait, they list \"Head: (7,1)\" then \"Body: [list of 20 coords]\" so total segments = 21. So after moving without eating apple, tail moves off (5,1) to (5,0)? Actually, tail is last body segment (5,1) currently. After move, head goes to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, so tail moves to previous position of segment before it. That means (5,1) will be gone next turn if no apple eaten. So (5,1) will be empty next turn. So LEFT from (6,1) to (5,1) will be safe next turn. Let's check carefully:  \nCurrent body: head (7,1), then (8,1), (8,2), ..., (5,1) as last. After moving to (6,1) without apple, new body: head (6,1), then old head (7,1) becomes first body segment, then (8,1), ..., (4,1) becomes last? Wait, shifting: the last body segment (5,1) is dropped. So (5,1) becomes empty. So from (6,1) next turn:  \nLEFT (5,1): empty (since dropped).  \nDOWN (6,0): empty.  \nUP (6,2): empty.  \nRIGHT (7,1): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options). That\u2019s better.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nUP gives 2 safe moves next turn, moves toward closest apple (8,7).  \nLEFT gives 3 safe moves next turn, moves toward (6,9) and (2,6).  \nDOWN gives 2 safe moves but traps on bottom edge.  \n\nLEFT seems best for future options. Also, enemy is far away (top row), no immediate threat. I should avoid trapping myself. Going LEFT opens more space.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 1), I\u2019ll have UP, DOWN, LEFT safe. I\u2019ll aim to go UP toward (6,9) or continue left toward (2,6), while keeping options open.\n\nLEFT",

Yes, (4, 1) is my last body segment currently, but after moving without apple, tail moves off (4, 1) \u2192 so (4, 1) will be empty next turn. Wait carefully: current body ends at (4, 1).

Also, enemy is far away in top rows, no immediate threat.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 2), I\u2019ll have UP, LEFT, RIGHT safe.

Last turn it was at (6,1), now at (6,2) per current state)\n\n**Safety check for each move from (2,9):**\n- **UP:** (2,10) \u2014 Off board. Dies.\n- **DOWN:** (2,8) \u2014 Check: \n  - My body: [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), ... (1,8)] \u2014 (2,8) is not in my current body? Actually, looking at the board state, (2,8) is '.' (free). But note: after my move, my tail will advance since I didn't eat last turn. So my new body will be: head at (2,9), then (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), ... and the tail (which was (2,8)) is removed. So (2,8) becomes free. However, we must check for enemy collisions this turn.\n  - Enemy body: Snake #0 has body including (8,6), (7,6), etc. (2,8) is not in enemy body.\n  - Enemy head: at (6,2), far away (Manhattan |2-6|+|8-2|=4+6=10). Safe.\n- **LEFT:** (1,9) \u2014 This is my own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n- **RIGHT:** (3,9) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my body: (3,9) is '.' (free).\n  - Not enemy body: (3,9) is not in enemy body.\n  - Enemy head at (6,2) is far (|3-6|+|9-2|=3+7=10). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Which move is better?**\n- DOWN (to (2,8)): This moves me away from the top row apples (9,9) and (6,9). But it might open up more options? From (2,8), I can go LEFT to (1,8) (which will be free? After tail advance, (1,8) is my body? Actually, my new body will include (1,9) as second segment, but (1,8) might be free? Wait: current body has (1,8) as the last segment? Actually, my current body ends at (1,8). After moving without eating, we remove the tail (which is (2,8)), so (1,8) becomes the new tail? So from (2,8), LEFT to (1,8) would be my own tail? But tails move, so it might be safe? However, it's risky: if I move DOWN to (2,8), then next turn LEFT to (1,8) might be safe only if the tail advances further. But it's complicated.\n- RIGHT (to (3,9)): This moves me toward the apples at (6,9) and (9,9). From (3,9), I can continue RIGHT along the top row. Also, there is an apple at (8,7) which I might reach later. This seems more proactive.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (2,6) is below, but I am at the top. Going DOWN might lead to that apple, but it's surrounded by my body? Actually, (2,6) is free? Board shows (2,6) is 'A'. But my body is all along the left and bottom? Actually, my body is mostly on the left and bottom edges. So (2,6) is accessible, but I'd have to navigate through my own body? That might be risky.\n\nGiven that I have 20 apples and need to get to 30, and the enemy also has 20, I should prioritize getting apples quickly. The top row has two apples: (6,9) and (9,9). Moving RIGHT along the top is a clear path.\n\nAlso, enemy is at (6,2), which is far. So I have time to collect the top apples.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the better choice.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,9), next turn I should continue RIGHT toward (6,9) and (9,9). From (3,9), safe moves will likely be RIGHT (to (4,9)) and DOWN (to (3,8)). Avoid UP (off board) and LEFT (back into body). So I should prefer RIGHT to get closer to the apples. Also, note that the apple at (8,7) is below, so after getting (6,9) I might go down to (8,7). But be cautious of enemy movements \u2014 enemy might come up? But currently enemy is low.\n\nRIGHT",

Dies.\n- **DOWN:** (3,8) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my body: (3,8) is '.' (free) \u2014 after tail advance, my body segments are: [(2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), ... (1,7)]; (3,8) is not in this list.\n  - Not enemy body: Snake #0's body includes [(6,2), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]; (3,8) is not present.\n  - Enemy head at (6,3) is far (|3-6|+|8-3|=3+5=8). Safe.\n- **LEFT:** (2,9) \u2014 This is my own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n- **RIGHT:** (4,9) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my body: (4,9) is '.' (free).\n  - Not enemy body: (4,9) is not in enemy body.\n  - Enemy head at (6,3) is far (|4-6|+|9-3|=2+6=8). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Which move is better?**\n- **RIGHT (to (4,9)):** This continues along the top row toward the apples at (6,9) and (9,9). From (4,9), next moves could be RIGHT (to (5,9)) or DOWN (to (4,8)). This path is direct and efficient for collecting apples quickly.\n- **DOWN (to (3,8)):** This moves away from the top apples and into a more congested area with my own body nearby. While it might eventually lead to the apple at (2,6) or (6,4), it is less direct and risks getting trapped in my own body loops.\n\nGiven that both snakes have 20 apples (tied), and the goal is to reach 30 first, I should prioritize the closest apples. The top row apples (6,9) and (9,9) are reachable in 2 and 5 moves respectively via RIGHT. The enemy is at (6,3) and might be heading toward (6,4) apple, but it is far from the top row.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the better choice to continue toward the apples efficiently.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (4,9), next turn continue RIGHT to (5,9) and then (6,9) to eat the apple. Then proceed toward (9,9). Be cautious of enemy movements \u2014 if enemy approaches the top, consider alternatives. Also, note the apple at (8,7) which can be reached after (6,9) by going DOWN. Avoid getting trapped in my own body; the top row is clear for now.\n\nRIGHT",

UP eats it immediately.  \nLEFT (5, 3) or RIGHT (7, 3) move away from it.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\nIf I go **UP** to (6, 4) and eat apple:  \nMy new head at (6, 4), body grows by 1, tail stays (so (3,2) drops).  \nNext turn from (6, 4):  \nUP (6, 5): my body (segment (6,5) currently) \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (6, 3): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (5, 4): empty.  \nRIGHT (7, 4): empty.  \nSo safe moves next turn: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options). Not great but manageable.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (5, 3):  \nNext turn from (5, 3):  \nUP (5, 4): empty.  \nDOWN (5, 2): empty (tail (3,2) drops, (5,2) free).  \nLEFT (4, 3): empty.  \nRIGHT (6, 3): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options). Good flexibility.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (7, 3):  \nNext turn from (7, 3):  \nUP (7, 4): empty.  \nDOWN (7, 2): my body (segment (7,2)? Actually (7,2) is not in my body list now \u2014 check: body has (8,2) but not (7,2). Wait, my body: (6,2) yes, but (7,2) no. So DOWN (7,2) is empty.  \nLEFT (6, 3): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (8, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN (2 options). Better than UP case.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nUP gives immediate apple (score 21 vs enemy 20), but next turn only 2 safe moves and I\u2019m near my body loop.  \nLEFT gives 3 safe moves next turn but delays apple.  \nRIGHT gives 2 safe moves next turn but also delays apple.  \n\nEnemy is far; I can afford to be slightly less greedy if it keeps me safer long-term. However, eating apple now puts me ahead in score and possibly pressures enemy.  \n\nBut check board: after eating apple at (6,4), my body will occupy (6,4)-(6,3)-(6,2)-... and tail at (3,2) drops. That leaves (6,5) still in my body, so UP from (6,4) blocked, DOWN blocked, only LEFT/RIGHT open. That\u2019s a bit tight but not trapped \u2014 I can go left toward open area columns 0\u20135.  \n\nLEFT now to (5,3) keeps more options and I can still get apple (6,4) later if enemy doesn\u2019t take it (enemy is far). But enemy could move toward (6,9) or (2,6), not (6,4) likely.  \n\nGiven scores tied at 20, getting apple first might force enemy to take risks. I\u2019ll take the apple.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nAfter eating apple at (6,4), go LEFT to (5,4) next turn to move toward open left side and possibly target apple (2,6) or (8,7) later. Avoid getting stuck near my own body loop. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible path toward (6,9) or (9,9).  \n\nUP",

It is the shortest path to the closest apple (6,9 is 1 move away after this). This is efficient and keeps me on the top row which is currently clear.\n- **DOWN (to (4,8)):** This moves away from the immediate apples and into a more congested area with my own body below. While it might eventually lead to other apples (like (2,6) or (2,7)), it is less direct and risks getting trapped in my own body loops.\n\nGiven that the enemy has 21 apples (one more than me), I need to catch up quickly. The apple at (6,9) is very close and can be eaten next turn if I go RIGHT. The enemy is at (6,4) and might be heading toward (2,6) or (2,7), but is far from the top row. Therefore, RIGHT is the better choice to secure the apple quickly.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (5,9), next turn move RIGHT to (6,9) to eat the apple. Then consider going DOWN to (6,8) to avoid being trapped at the top edge and to approach the apple at (8,7). Alternatively, continue RIGHT toward (9,9) if safe. Monitor the enemy's movement \u2014 if it approaches the top, be cautious. Avoid moving into my own body which is concentrated on the left side.\n\nRIGHT",

Eating the apple at (6,9) now ties the score and is the fastest way to do so. The enemy is at (5,4) and is unlikely to reach (6,9) this turn (it would need to move UP four times). Therefore, RIGHT is the better choice to secure the apple immediately.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (6,9) and eating the apple, my head will be at (6,9) and I'll have 21 apples. Next turn, consider moving DOWN to (6,8) to avoid being trapped at the top edge and to approach the apple at (8,7). Alternatively, if the enemy is moving up, be cautious. Avoid moving into my own body which is concentrated on the left side. Monitor the enemy's movement \u2014 it might be heading toward (2,6) or (2,7).\n\nRIGHT",

(free).\n  - Not enemy body: Snake #0's body includes [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), ... (3,4)]; (6,8) is not present.\n  - Enemy head at (5,3) is far (|6-5|+|8-3|=1+5=6). Safe.\n- **LEFT:** (5,9) \u2014 This is my own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n- **RIGHT:** (7,9) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my body: (7,9) is '.'

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Which move is better?**\n- **RIGHT (to (7,9)):** This moves toward the apple at (9,9). However, note that my body is long and occupies the left side. Moving right continues along the top edge, which might lead to a dead-end if I get trapped. Also, the enemy is below and might move up to compete for (9,9).\n- **DOWN (to (6,8)):** This moves away from the top edge and into more open space. It avoids immediate danger and gives more flexibility for future moves. From (6,8), I can go left, right, or down next turn. It also positions me to potentially go for the apple at (8,7) or others.\n\nGiven that I just ate an apple last turn (now at 21 apples, tied with enemy), I should prioritize safety and avoid getting trapped. The top row is risky because I have limited escape routes. Moving DOWN opens up more options and reduces the risk of being cornered. The enemy is at (5,3) and is unlikely to threaten me immediately.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (6,8), assess next moves. Consider heading toward (8,7) or other apples. Avoid moving into the left side where my body is concentrated. Monitor enemy movement \u2014 it might be going for (2,6) or (2,7). Since scores are tied, focus on safe apple collection and avoid head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Which move is better?**\n- **RIGHT (to (7,8)):** Moves toward the apple at (8,7) and (9,9). However, the top row is congested with my body, and moving right might lead to a dead-end. Also, enemy might compete for (8,7).\n- **LEFT (to (5,8)):** Moves away from the right side and toward the center. But my body is heavily concentrated on the left, so moving left might reduce future options.\n- **DOWN (to (6,7)):** Moves into more open space. From (6,7), I can go left, right, or down next turn. It avoids the crowded top and left areas. Also, it positions me to potentially go for the apple at (8,7) via a safer route (e.g., right then down) or other apples.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (6,7), assess next moves. Consider heading toward (8,7) by moving RIGHT then DOWN, but avoid getting trapped. The enemy is at (4,3) and might be going for the apples at (2,6) or (2,7). Since scores are tied, prioritize safety and flexible positioning. Avoid head-on collisions and maintain escape routes.\n\nDOWN",

(free).\n  - Not enemy body: (7,7) is not in enemy body.\n  - Enemy head at (3,3) is far (|7-3|+|7-3|=4+4=8). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Which move is better?**\n- **RIGHT (to (7,7)):** Moves directly toward the apple at (8,7). However, this is risky because the enemy might also be heading there. Also, from (7,7), I could be forced into the right wall or into my body if not careful.\n- **LEFT (to (5,7)):** Moves away from the right-side apples but into more open space. However, my body is heavily concentrated on the left, so moving left might reduce future options.\n- **DOWN (to (6,6)):** Moves into open space and avoids immediate congestion. From (6,6), I have multiple options: left to (5,6), right to (7,6), or down to (6,5). This maintains flexibility.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAvoid direct competition for (8,7) since enemy might be approaching. Instead, consider going for the apples on the left (2,6) or (2,7) which are closer and less contested. The enemy is at (3,3) and might be heading toward (2,2) or (2,6/7). Moving DOWN to (6,6) positions me to go left toward (2,6/7) while keeping options open. Alternatively, I can wait and see if enemy takes (8,7) and then plan accordingly.\n\nDOWN",

It is enemy body.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is shown as '.' which is free.\n\nAnd (6,5) is free? Row 5: \"T . . . T T T T T .\" \u2014 so (6,5) is T (my body? Actually, my body includes (0,5) to (0,0) and (1,0) etc., but (6,5) is not listed in my body. However, the board shows (6,5) as T? Let's see: at x=6,y=5, it is the 7th character in row 5: \"T . . . T T T T T .\" \u2014 so positions:\n(0,5): T\n(1,5): .\n(2,5): .\n(3,5): .\n(4,5): T (enemy body)\n(5,5): T (enemy body)\n(6,5): T (enemy body? But wait, enemy body includes (6,5)? Actually, from the list: enemy body has (6,5)? No, it has (7,5) and (5,5), but not (6,5). However, the board shows it as T. So it must be enemy body.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's rely on the provided enemy body list: Snake #0 body includes (6,5)? Actually, the list says: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)] \u2014 wait, the list has 21 segments? But the apples collected is 21, so length should be 22? Actually, the body list does not include the head. So total segments = head + body = 22.\n\nBut in the list, (6,5) is explicitly listed: \" (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), \" so yes, (6,5) is enemy body.\n\nTherefore, from (6,6):\n- UP: (6,7) my body - unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,5) enemy body - unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,6) - check: not in my body, not in enemy body (enemy body has (5,5), (5,3), etc., but not (5,6)). So safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,6) - enemy body (listed as (7,6)) - unsafe.\n\nSo only safe move is LEFT to (5,6).\n\n**Plan:**\nOnly one safe move: LEFT to (5,6). This moves me away from the enemy and toward the left side. From (5,6), I can consider going up to (5,7) (toward apple at (2,7)) or down to (5,5) (but (5,5) is enemy body, so not safe). So next turn, I might have to go up or left/right. This is restrictive, but necessary to survive.\n\nLEFT",

Actually, the turn number is 82, so the enemy has already moved. Their head is at (2,5) as per the current state.)\n\n**Safety check for each move from (5,7):**\n- **UP:** (5,8) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my body: My body segments are [(5,6), (6,6), ... (1,0)]; (5,8) is '.' (free).\n  - Not enemy body: Snake #0's body includes [(2,4), (2,3), ... (5,5)]; (5,8) is not present.\n  - Enemy head at (2,5) is far (|5-2|+|8-5|=3+3=6). Safe.\n- **DOWN:** (5,6) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - But (5,6) is my own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n- **LEFT:** (4,7) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my body: (4,7) is '.' (free).\n  - Not enemy body: (4,7) is not in enemy body list.\n  - Enemy head at (2,5) is safe (|4-2|+|7-5|=2+2=4). Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (6,7) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - But (6,7) is my own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves are UP and LEFT.\n\n**Plan:**\nI need to go for apples while avoiding the enemy. The closest apples are at (2,7) and (2,6). From (5,7), going LEFT (to (4,7)) gets me closer to these apples. Going UP (to (5,8)) moves me away. Also, there is an apple at (8,7) which is to the right, but I cannot go right safely. Another apple at (9,9) is far.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,5) and might be going for the same apples (2,6) and (2,7). They might move up to (2,6) or right to (3,5) etc. I should move left to (4,7) to get closer and be ready to compete. From (4,7), I can go left again to (3,7) or up to (4,8) or down to (4,6) (but (4,6) is enemy body? Actually, enemy body has (5,5) but not (4,6) \u2014 wait, check: enemy body list: (6,5) is there, but (4,6) is free). So LEFT is good and sets me up for future moves toward the apples.\n\nLong-term: I should aim for (2,7) and (2,6). The enemy is also at 21 apples, so this is a race. I need to be efficient and avoid head-on collisions. Since we are both long, maneuvering might be tricky. I should also consider the apple at (2,2) but that is deeper in enemy territory.\n\nLEFT",

So I could get (2,7) before enemy if they go LEFT then UP.  \nDOWN (2, 5): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (1, 6): empty.  \nRIGHT (3, 6): empty.  \nSo next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (1, 5):  \nNext turn from (1, 5):  \nUP (1, 6): empty.  \nDOWN (1, 4): empty.  \nLEFT (0, 5): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (2, 5): my old head \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (3, 5):  \nNext turn from (3, 5):  \nUP (3, 6): empty.  \nDOWN (3, 4): empty.  \nLEFT (2, 5): my old head \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (4, 5): my body at (4,5)? Wait, my body has (5,5) and (4,5) is not listed \u2014 actually (4,5) is not in my body list, so empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nUP gives apple plus 3 future options; RIGHT gives 3 future options but no apple; LEFT gives only 2 options.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision this turn**  \nEnemy safe moves: UP to (5, 8) or LEFT to (4, 7).  \nMy UP to (2, 6) is far from both.  \nNo immediate head-on risk.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEat (2, 6) now, then next turn evaluate if enemy is heading toward (2, 7). If enemy moves UP to (5, 8), they\u2019re going toward (8, 7) apple, leaving (2, 7) for me. If enemy moves LEFT to (4, 7), they\u2019re two steps from (2, 7) via (3,7)\u2192(2,7), while I\u2019d be one step away at (2,6). So I can still get (2,7) first unless they move LEFT and I hesitate.  \nAfter (2,7), consider moving toward (2,2) apple or circling back toward center. Avoid trapping myself in top-left corner.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP gives immediate apple, keeps future options open, and progresses toward another apple while staying safe from enemy this turn.\n\nUP",

Actually, the turn number is 83, so the enemy has already moved. Their head is at (2,6) as per the current state.)\n\n**Safety check for each move from (4,7):**\n- **UP:** (4,8) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my body: My body segments are [(5,7), (5,6), ... (0,0)]; (4,8) is '.' (free).\n  - Not enemy body: Snake #0's body includes [(2,5), (2,4), ... (5,5)]; (4,8) is not present.\n  - Enemy head at (2,6) is safe (|4-2|+|8-6|=2+2=4). Safe.\n- **DOWN:** (4,6) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my body: (4,6) is '.' (free).\n  - Not enemy body: (4,6) is not in enemy body list.\n  - Enemy head at (2,6) is safe (|4-2|+|6-6|=2+0=2). Safe? But note: if enemy moves to (3,6) or (2,7), it might be risky. However, currently safe.\n- **LEFT:** (3,7) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my body: (3,7) is '.' (free).\n  - Not enemy body: (3,7) is not in enemy body list.\n  - Enemy head at (2,6) is safe (|3-2|+|7-6|=1+1=2). Safe? But close. However, enemy might move away or towards.\n- **RIGHT:** (5,7) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - But (5,7) is my own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Plan:**\nI need to go for apples while avoiding the enemy. The closest apples are at (2,7) and (8,7). From (4,7), going LEFT (to (3,7)) gets me closer to (2,7). Going DOWN (to (4,6)) moves me towards (4,1) but that is deeper and enemy is near. Going UP (to (4,8)) moves me away from immediate apples.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2,6) and might be going for (2,7) or (3,6). They are very close to (2,7). If I move LEFT to (3,7), I can then go to (2,7) next turn. However, if the enemy moves to (2,7) this turn, then I cannot go there without head-on collision. So I should avoid moving directly towards the enemy head if it might lead to collision.\n\nAlternatively, I can go DOWN to (4,6) to avoid the enemy and go for (4,1) or (2,2). But (4,1) is close and (2,2) is near enemy territory.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (2,6) and likely to move to (2,7) (since that is an apple), I should not go to (3,7) if I suspect they will be at (2,7). Instead, I should go DOWN to (4,6) to be safe and then plan to go left to (3,6) or down to (4,5) to get to (4,1) or (2,2). This avoids potential collision.\n\nAlso, going DOWN gives me more options: from (4,6), I can go LEFT to (3,6), DOWN to (4,5), or RIGHT to (5,6) (but (5,6) is my body? Actually, (5,6) is my body, so not right). So LEFT and DOWN are safe from there.\n\nLong-term: I have 21 apples, enemy has 22. I need to catch up. The apples at (2,7) and (2,2) are valuable. But (2,7) is risky due to enemy. So I should go for (4,1) first? It is closer and safer.\n\nSo DOWN to (4,6) is a good move to avoid the enemy and head towards (4,1).\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

My tail is long, so I must keep space to maneuver. After eating (2, 7), I could go UP to (2, 8) or RIGHT to (3, 7) to stay flexible.

Moving LEFT to (3,6) gets me closer to (1,5) and (2,2), but also closer to the enemy at (2,7). Moving UP to (4,7) moves me away from the apples and towards the enemy.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (2,7), they might move to (3,7) or (2,8) or (1,7). If I move LEFT to (3,6), I am at risk if they move to (3,7) (adjacent). Similarly, moving UP to (4,7) is adjacent to (3,7) which they might choose. Moving DOWN to (4,5) is safer because it puts distance between me and the enemy.\n\nAlso, (4,1) is a safe apple to target. From (4,5), I can go DOWN to (4,4) and then to (4,3), etc., to reach (4,1). Alternatively, I can go LEFT to (3,5) and then down to (3,4) to avoid the enemy.\n\nLong-term: I have 21 apples, enemy has 23 (they just ate one). I need to catch up. The apple at (4,1) is close and uncontested. The enemy is likely to go for (8,7) or (9,9) next, which are far away. So I should secure (4,1) and then (2,2) or (1,5).\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move to avoid the enemy and head towards (4,1).\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT seems safest for future options.  \nAfter RIGHT, I can go UP toward (8, 7) apple or DOWN toward (4, 1) apple later, while avoiding enemy\u2019s likely path toward (2, 2) or (4, 1).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (3, 7), next turn likely go UP to (3, 8) to keep space, then consider moving toward (8, 7) apple via rightward movement, but watch enemy\u2019s position.

I should target the closer apples: (4,1) and (2,2) and (1,5). Moving DOWN to (4,4) gets me closer to (4,1). Moving LEFT to (3,5) gets me closer to (1,5) and (2,2). Moving RIGHT to (5,5) moves me away from the apples and towards the enemy's territory (which is risky).\n\nAlso, consider future moves: From (4,4), I can go DOWN to (4,3) and then (4,2) and (4,1) to eat the apple. This path is clear and safe. From (3,5), I can go DOWN to (3,4) and then LEFT to (2,4) to approach (2,2) or (1,5), but this brings me closer to the enemy at (3,7). The enemy might move down or left, so I should avoid being too close.\n\nSince the enemy is at (3,7), moving LEFT to (3,5) is only 2 steps away vertically (|5-7|=2), which is safe but risky if they move down. Moving DOWN to (4,4) is safer (|4-3|+|4-7|=1+3=4). Moving RIGHT to (5,5) is also safe but less efficient for apple hunting.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move to safely approach (4,1) and avoid the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

(free).\n  - Not enemy body: Snake #0's body includes [(3,7), (2,7), ...]; (4,3) is not present.\n  - Enemy head at (3,8) is safe (|4-3|+|3-8|=1+5=6). Safe.\n- **LEFT:** (3,4) \u2014 Check:\n  - Not off board.\n  - Not my body: (3,4) is '.'

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Plan:**\nThe enemy is at (3,8) and has 23 apples (close to winning). They are likely to go for the apple at (9,9) or (8,7) next. I should target the closer apples: (4,1) and (2,2) and (1,5). Moving DOWN to (4,3) gets me closer to (4,1). Moving LEFT to (3,4) gets me closer to (2,2) and (1,5). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) moves me away from the apples and towards the enemy's territory.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go DOWN to (4,2) and then (4,1) to eat the apple. This path is clear and safe. From (3,4), I can go DOWN to (3,3) and then LEFT to (2,3) to approach (2,2) or (1,5), but this brings me closer to the enemy at (3,8). The enemy might move down or left, so I should avoid being too close.\n\nSince the enemy is at (3,8), moving LEFT to (3,4) is 4 steps away vertically (|4-8|=4), which is safe but still risky if they move down aggressively. Moving DOWN to (4,3) is safer (|4-3|+|3-8|=1+5=6). Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe but inefficient.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move to safely approach (4,1) and avoid the enemy. I need to collect apples quickly to catch up (21 vs 23).\n\nDOWN",
