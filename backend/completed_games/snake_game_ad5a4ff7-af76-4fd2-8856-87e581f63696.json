Avoid collisions with walls and other snakes.\n2. Eat as many apples as possible to gain points.\n3. Try to block enemy snakes from eating apples.\n\nGiven the current board state, I can see two apples that I can reach without colliding with other snakes or walls: one at (2, 2) and one at (8, 6).\n\nTo reach the apple at (2, 2), I would need to move left, but that would leave me exposed to snake #2, which is currently moving towards me.\n\nTo reach the apple at (8, 6), I would need to move right. This move would not put me in immediate danger from other snakes or walls, and it would also block snake #2 from reaching the apple at (9, 9).\n\nSo, my strategy for this turn is to move right (to (5, 7)) to reach the apple at (8, 6) and potentially block snake #2.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
