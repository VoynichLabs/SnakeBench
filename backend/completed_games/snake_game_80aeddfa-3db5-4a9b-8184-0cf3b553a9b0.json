This might actually give me some breathing room for my movement, but it's essential I keep in mind where snake #1 is in relation to my target apple and how I can navigate around them or reach the closest available apple first.\n\nIn light of these considerations, a viable approach could be to try and go towards the (8, 4) apple without immediately putting myself in a vulnerable position.

I'll try to stay flexible and adjust my plan accordingly based on the new board state.\n\nConsidering the apple positions, I think I should prioritize getting to the apple at (8, 4) over the other apples, as it's relatively close to my current position.\n\nNext turn strategy: I will continue to move up to (5, 7) and then adjust my plan accordingly based on the new board state.\n\nUP.",
