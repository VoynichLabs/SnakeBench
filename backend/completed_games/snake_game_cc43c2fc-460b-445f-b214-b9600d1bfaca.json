Our last move was UP, which aligns with the strategy to collect the apple at (4, 9). However, since we are now at (3, 9), we need to re-evaluate the situation.\n\nThe apples are located at: (0, 2), (4, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (4, 8). The closest apple to us is at (4, 8), which is directly to the right of our head. However, moving right would put us in the path of the enemy snake #1, which is currently at (4, 9) and moving upwards. This could be dangerous as the enemy snake might turn right and collide with us on the next move.\n\nThe next closest apple is at (4, 7), which is two moves away diagonally up and to the right from our current position. To move towards this apple without putting ourselves in immediate danger, we should move UP to (3, 8) on this turn. This will position us to potentially move towards (4, 7) on the next turn, while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake and not running into our own tail.\n\nHere's the current state of the board with our snake's head at (3, 9):\n\n```\n 9 . . . 0 1 T T T . .\n 8 . . . T A . . . . .\n 7 . . . T A . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 A . . . . . A . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . . . A . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nGiven this analysis, the next move should be: UP\n\n Strategy for the next turn: After moving up to (3, 8), we should evaluate the enemy snake's movement. If the enemy snake continues to move up or left, we can safely move to the right towards the apple at (4, 7). If the enemy snake moves right, we should continue moving up towards (3, 7) to avoid a collision and then turn right towards the apple.\n\nNext move: UP",
