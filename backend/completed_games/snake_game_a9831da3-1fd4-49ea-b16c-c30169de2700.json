SNAKE #0 IS ALL THE WAY AT (5, 7). HE'S WAY UP THERE, WE'RE DOWN HERE. WE GOTTA BE SMART!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP: (3, 1) \u27a1\ufe0f EMPTY! \u2705\n- DOWN: (3, -1) \u27a1\ufe0f OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEAD! ELIMINATE!\n- LEFT: (2, 0) \u27a1\ufe0f HAS AN APPLE! BUT IS IT SAFE? CELL IS EMPTY! \u2705\n- RIGHT: (4, 0) \u27a1\ufe0f EMPTY! \u2705\n\nOKAY SO DOWN IS INSTANT DEATH. NOT AN OPTION. WE HAVE UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** He's at (5, 7). He can go anywhere! But he's far away, so zero risk of head-on collision this turn. We're safe from that.\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:** Left has an apple at (2, 0)! FREE GROWTH! But is that the best long-term move? Let's think... Going left grabs an apple instantly, but then my body segment will be at (3, 0). That could block me later. But we need to GROW to get strong! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS:**\n- If I go LEFT to (2, 0): Next turn, I'll have a body behind me. I can go UP to (2,1), LEFT to (1,0) (another apple!), or... DOWN is off-board, RIGHT is back into my new body? Wait, my new body after eating will be at (3,0). So from (2,0), going RIGHT to (3,0) would be suicide! So that's one move eliminated. Hmm.\n- If I go UP to (3, 1): From there, I have UP, LEFT, RIGHT open. Down would go back to (3,0) which is safe for now. More options remain open.\n- If I go RIGHT to (4, 0): Similar to UP, all directions open except LEFT (back to start). Good options.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **LONG-TERM PLAN (For my future self):** Enemy is north. We need to move UP the board to pressure him. Grabbing the apple to our left gives us early size but might trap us in the corner. Maybe better to move to a more open central area first? Let's establish board control. Prioritize moving towards the center to have more maneuvering room against the enemy. We can get apples later.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** The safe play with the most future flexibility is to move UP. We avoid the potential trap of the southwest corner, gain central position, and can assess the enemy's next move. LET'S NOT GET GREEDY ON TURN ONE! We go for positioning!\n\nUP",

Moving away from the enemy and the main apple cluster. Seems weak.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **LONG-TERM PLAN (For my future self):** The enemy is up there getting apples. We need to get BIG and push north to cut him off! That apple to the left is a guaranteed, safe growth. Taking it now gives us a size advantage early. Yeah, it slightly reduces our immediate next-turn options, but it's WORTH IT for the power spike! We can maneuver out of the corner later. AGGRESSION AND GROWTH! Let's DOMINATE!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** Taking the free, safe apple is the aggressive, high-reward play. We start building our lead and put pressure on Snake #0.

He might also go LEFT towards the cluster of apples.\n\n**SHORT-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe need to start cutting off his options! We're shorter right now (2 vs his 2? Wait, both have 1 apple, so both have 2 segments! IT'S A TIE!). Head-on collision right now would be a DOUBLE KO \ud83d\ude35.

The safest path to an apple is UP then LEFT towards the cluster, but that's a long journey. We need to stay safe and start moving towards resources while blocking the enemy's path down.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nMoving RIGHT to (3,2) feels like it pushes us into the open board, but AWAY from the apples. Moving LEFT to (1,2) gets us closer to that left-side apple cluster and starts our journey to cut off the enemy's path down the board. This is the AGGRESSIVE, BOARD-CONTROL move!

He's gonna want those! He's probably moving LEFT towards (5,9) to start his descent.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (For my future self):** We are SMOL but AGILE! We need to GROW to challenge his length advantage. The left-side apples are the prize! We need to move UP and LEFT to get into position to intercept him or steal those apples before he does. We MUST avoid a head-on collision until we are longer! Let's use our agility to cut him off and force him into a bad spot!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nMoving RIGHT to (2,3) feels like we're drifting away from the action and the apple cluster. Moving LEFT to (0,3) pins us against the wall, which is dangerous long-term. Moving UP to (1,4) is the play! It opens up future options (we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP next turn) and starts our aggressive push towards the center-top where the enemy and the apples are! We're playing the board, not just reacting! LET'S GO UP! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

He probably wants to escape the corner, so DOWN (away from the wall) is likely. BUT he might also see the apple at (7,6) and go LEFT then DOWN? We gotta be SMART!\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe have 2 apples, he has 4. We need to FEAST and close the gap! Our left side is a BUFFET! Look at all those A's! Going UP to (1,7) grabs an apple and puts us right next to another one at (1,8). This is MAXIMUM GROWTH! We become length 4, same as him! Then we can push him into the corner. We want to get between him and the rest of the board, cutting off his escape. If we go left or right, we miss this quick power-up. The enemy is distracted \u2013 let's capitalize!\n\n**FUTURE ME, LISTEN UP!** After eating the (1,7) apple, we'll be at (1,7) with body [(1,6),(1,5),(1,4)]. Look to go UP to (1,8) for another apple, or LEFT/RIGHT to start boxing the enemy in. Avoid a direct head-on collision until we have a length advantage!

Body: [(8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)].\nLast turn I predicted he'd go DOWN to (8,6) for the apple... let's check his possible moves NOW:\n- **LEFT:** (8, 7) is his own neck! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n- **RIGHT:** OFF THE BOARD! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n- **UP:** (9, 8) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- **DOWN:** (9, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705\n\nSo he can go UP or DOWN. That apple at (8,4) is a juicy target! My guess? He goes DOWN to **(9,6)**, then next turn to (9,5), then (9,4) to line up that apple! He's trying to extend his lead! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nChat, we are BOXED IN! We only have two moves: LEFT or RIGHT. If we go RIGHT, we eat the apple at (2,8), tie the score at 5-5, and our head moves away from the enemy. But then what? We're in column 2, with our long body blocking us from going back left. We'd be stuck on the left edge! \ud83d\ude28\n\nIf we go LEFT to (0,8), we DON'T get an apple, but we open up SO MANY OPTIONS! From (0,8), next turn we can go DOWN to (0,7) or UP to (0,9) if it's safe. This keeps us flexible! We can travel along the top or left walls to get around our own body and then cut off the enemy's path to the center. The enemy is stuck on the right side for now. We need to use our LEFT move to MANEUVER and trap him! Getting greedy for the apple right now could put us in a dead end! Let's play the long game! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**FUTURE ME, LISTEN UP!** We are playing for position! From (0,8), our goal is to move SOUTH (DOWN) along the left wall to eventually swing around and get between the enemy and the middle of the board. We want to force him into a corner! Patience, chat! We'll get those apples later!\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9)].\nOkay, so he's trapped on the right edge too! His options:\n- **LEFT:** (8, 5) is EMPTY! \u27a1\ufe0f Likely to chase apples at (7,5) or (7,6)! \u2705\n- **RIGHT:** OFF BOARD! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n- **UP:** (9, 6) is HIS NECK! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n- **DOWN:** (9, 4) is EMPTY! \u27a1\ufe0f Could go for the apple at (8,4)? \u2705\n\nHe has two options: LEFT or DOWN. If he goes LEFT, he's moving into the center. If he goes DOWN, he's staying on the edge. We need to cut him off!\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n**FUTURE ME, WE HAVE NO CHOICE NOW!** We are forced to go RIGHT to (1, 9). Our next move will be CRITICAL! From (1,9), our options will be:\n- **DOWN:** (1, 8) is OUR BODY! \u274c NO!\n- **LEFT:** (0, 9) is OUR BODY! \u274c NO!\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 9) is FREE (and has an apple!) \u2705\n- **UP:** OFF BOARD! \u274c\n\nSo next turn, we will only be able to go RIGHT! That apple at (2,9) will make us GROW to length 6! We'll then be at (2,9). We need to plan the turn AFTER that. Once we eat that apple, we must avoid boxing ourselves in. After going RIGHT to (2,9), our safe moves will depend on where our new tail is. We MUST find a way to start moving DOWN the board to cut off the enemy's escape from the right side. He has a longer snake (length 6 vs our soon-to-be 6), but a head-on collision would be a double KO, and we'd lose because he has more apples! So we need to trap him without a direct head-to-head. Let's use the top row to our advantage and then swing down to control the center!\n\nRIGHT",

That would make his score 6, same as ours will be next turn. We cannot let him get a lead! If we meet head-on with equal length, it's a DOUBLE KO and WE LOSE because he has more apples!\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n**FUTURE ME, LISTEN UP!** After this forced move to (2,9), our body will be: [(2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (1,8), (1,7)]\nOur head will be at (2,9).

From (2,8), our ONLY safe move would be DOWN again to (2,7), because LEFT (1,8) is our body, RIGHT (3,8) is empty but then UP (3,9) is free? Wait, let's think: After moving to (2,8), our tail will be at (1,7). Our body: [(2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (1,8)].\nActually, from (2,8):\n- UP to (2,9) is our neck! \u274c\n- DOWN to (2,7) is FREE \u2705\n- LEFT to (1,8) is our body! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (3,8) is FREE \u2705\nSo we'd have DOWN and RIGHT! That's okay! But we need to start descending to cut off the enemy's path up the board!\nOur goal is to move DOWN and LEFT eventually to control the center. The enemy is on the right side. We need to get between him and the rest of the board. If we go RIGHT next turn, we stay on the top edge and get even more trapped. WE MUST GO DOWN NEXT TURN TO START OUR ATTACK RUN!\n\nRIGHT",

Moving DOWN to (3,6) is safe but keeps us vertical. Moving LEFT to (2,7) is safe but takes us AWAY from the action. RIGHT is the AGGRESSIVE play! Let's meet him head-on! We're the same length now, so a head-on collision is a DOUBLE KO, which is a DRAW... but wait, if we have equal apples, a double KO is a draw. We need to get ONE MORE APPLE to win a head-on collision! So let's get in position to grab an apple AND block him! There's an apple at (4,3) and (5,4) down below. Moving RIGHT sets us up to swoop down and grab one while cutting him off! RIGHT IS THE PLAY! LET'S BOX HIM IN!\n\nRIGHT",

He could come LEFT (towards us), UP (towards our tail area), or DOWN (towards apples). We need to PREDICT and COUNTER!\n\n**STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWe just moved RIGHT last turn to cut him off. He moved LEFT as predicted! NOW we're FACE TO FACE! If we go RIGHT to (5,7) for the apple, we'll be adjacent to him if he goes UP to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,6). A head-on collision when scores are tied is a DOUBLE KO! We can't risk that! We need to be LONGER to win a head-on! So grabbing that apple is KEY, but we must do it SAFELY.\n\nLet's think... If we go **DOWN** to (4,6), we put space between us AND position ourselves to cut off his path to the bottom-left apples. He might go for the apple at (5,4) or (4,3). If we go DOWN now, we can get between him and that prize! Going UP to (4,8) feels too passive, taking us to the top where our long body is. We need to control the center and the apple-rich bottom half!\n\n**THE MOVE:** RIGHT is tempting for the instant score tie... but it's AGGRESSIVE and puts us right next to his potential moves. DOWN is the SMART, CONTROLLING play. It keeps us safe, maintains multiple options (we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN next turn), and starts to BOX HIM IN by cutting off his downward escape routes! Let's take the strategic position! WE'LL GET THAT APPLE LATER WHEN WE HAVE A LENGTH ADVANTAGE! DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

Should we dive down for that sweet (5,7) apple or float up to (5,9)? \ud83e\udd14  \n\n\ud83e\udde0 Rationale:  \n- Moving **DOWN** lands us on (5,7) \u2013 an apple right in our path, instantly boosting our score to 9 and length to 10.  \n- This also shoves us closer to Snake\u202f#1\u2019s head at (4,4), setting up a future head\u2011on clash when we have the length advantage.  \n- From (5,7) we keep multiple escape routes: LEFT to (4,7), RIGHT to (6,7) or DOWN to (5,6). No dead\u2011ends, no immediate traps.  \n- Staying **UP** would eat (5,9) but lock us into only left/right moves next turn, losing vertical flexibility.  \n- **LEFT** won\u2019t eat an apple now and leaves us farther from the opponent, letting them breathe.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Long\u2011term note to self:  \n- Eat (5,7) now \u2192 grow \u2192 swing left toward the (4,0) apple cluster while hugging the bottom\u2011left corner.  \n- Use the extra segment to box Snake\u202f#1 from the side, forcing a collision when they try to retreat upward.  \n- Keep the board crowded; the more we stretch, the fewer safe exits they have.  \n\nDOWN",

It's an apple, not a body! So all three moves are safe! LET'S GO!\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION:** Snake #0 head is at **(5, 8)**. He moved LEFT last turn! He's UP and to our right.\n\n**WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?**\nHe has options: UP to (5,9) which is empty, DOWN to (5,7) which is empty, LEFT to (4,8) which is empty, or RIGHT to (6,8) which is HIS BODY! \ud83d\udeab So he can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** We have 7 apples, he has 8. A head-on would KILL US BOTH, and he'd win by having more apples! \ud83d\ude31 We MUST avoid that!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (5,4): Could he move in a way that puts his head there next turn? It's 4 squares away... probably not this turn. But we're moving TOWARDS him. Risky play!\n\nIf we go DOWN to (4,3): That's an apple! And it moves us AWAY from him, towards the bottom-left apple cluster (0,5), (2,0), (1,0)! This is our path to GROWTH and overtaking his score! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3,4): Also moves us away from him, towards the left side. Safe, but misses the immediate apple at (4,3).\n\n**THE VERDICT:** The AGGRESSIVE play for growth is DOWN! We grab that apple at (4,3), tie the score at 8-8, and position ourselves to dominate the bottom-left! \ud83d\udcaa This also keeps us far from his potential path. He's more likely to go UP or towards the center.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** We're tying the score! Next, we need to grab (0,5) and the other bottom apples to take the LEAD. Keep boxing him out on the right side. If we get a lead, THEN we can force a head-on! FOR NOW, GROW SAFELY!\n\nDOWN",

HOLD UP. Let's trace... from (5,4) head, body goes to (5,5), then (5,6)... (7,4) is his tail. So (6,4) is NOT part of his body! It's EMPTY! \u2705)\n\nWAIT WAIT, I LIED! I MISREAD! HIS BODY IS: [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4)]. So (6,4) is NOT in that list! It's safe for him! So his safe moves are DOWN (5,3) and RIGHT (6,4)!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nWe're still DOWN by 1 apple (9 vs 10). A head-on collision now means WE DIE AND HE WINS! We CANNOT let that happen! \ud83d\udea8\n*   If he goes RIGHT to (6,4), he's moving away from us. No risk.\n*   If he goes DOWN to (5,3), he's moving parallel and slightly towards us, but not directly. The risk is LOW.\n*   Our moves: DOWN to (3,0) or LEFT to (2,1) are both AWAY from him. SAFE. RIGHT to (4,1) moves us CLOSER to his possible path. That's a bit riskier, but still not a direct collision course.\n\n**LONG-TERM DOMINANCE & THE PLAN:**\nCHAT, LOOK AT THE BOARD! Our body is creating a WALL on the right! He's trapped against us and the top wall! Meanwhile, that APPLE BUFFET at the bottom is CALLING OUR NAME! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (4,0)! Going DOWN to (3,0) grabs an apple, ties the score at 10-10, and puts us right in the middle of the feast! This is PERFECT! We farm the entire left side while he's stuck!\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\nLEFT and RIGHT are safe, but they don't get us that immediate apple and don't position us as powerfully. DOWN is the AGGRESSIVE, HIGH-REWARD play! We tie the score, grow longer, and establish dominance over the most valuable real estate on the board! This is how we WIN! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** WE'RE FARMING THE BOTTOM! After grabbing (3,0), we can swing left to (2,0) and (1,0). Our long body will act as a barrier, making it hard for him to contest. If he tries to come down, we can use our length to cut him off! ON TO VICTORY! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

LET'S GO!)\n*   **DOWN:** (0, -1) \u27a1\ufe0f **OFF THE BOARD!** \ud83d\udeab (INSTANT DEATH! NO WAY!)\n*   **LEFT:** (-1, 0) \u27a1\ufe0f **OFF THE BOARD!** \ud83d\udeab (INSTANT DEATH! ABSOLUTELY NOT!)\n*   **RIGHT:** (1, 0) \u27a1\ufe0f **OUR BODY!** \ud83d\udeab (That's our neck! SUICIDE! \u274c)\n\nSO OUR **ONLY** SAFE MOVE IS **UP**! OUR PREDICTION FROM LAST TURN WAS SPOT ON! WE'RE EXECUTING THE PLAN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (SNAKE #0 at (6, 1)):**\nHe just moved to (6,1) where there was an apple! So he grew! His safe moves are:\n*   UP (6, 2) \u27a1\ufe0f **HIS BODY!** \ud83d\udeab (That's his old head! DEATH!)\n*   DOWN (6, 0) \u27a1\ufe0f **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\u2705 (ANOTHER FREE MEAL?

HE'S SURROUNDED!)\n\nHe's got THREE safe moves, all good! He's gonna grab an apple for sure. DOWN (6,0) or RIGHT (7,1) are the most lucrative. This will extend his lead to 14 apples! \ud83d\ude21\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nWe're at (0,0). He's at (6,1). No possible head-on this turn. We're SAFE! But we're falling behind on the scoreboard! \ud83d\ude2c\n\n**STRATEGIC DOMINANCE - ADJUSTING THE PLAN!**\nCHAT, WE'RE STUCK WITH ONE MOVE. THAT'S THE RISK OF THE CORNER PLAY! But look at our body! We own the entire left side from top to bottom! Our body is a WALL! \ud83c\udff0\nAfter we eat the apple at (0,1), we'll have more options! We can go RIGHT to (1,1) or UP to (0,2). We NEED to use that flexibility to get AGGRESSIVE! We can't let him farm apples on the right side uncontested! We need to start CUTTING HIM OFF! Our long body is our greatest weapon! We can trap him!\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\nIt's not even a choice! **UP** is our only move! But it's a GOOD move! We get an apple, we tie the score at 13-13, and we set up for a counter-attack! LET'S GO!\n\n**MESSAGE TO FUTURE SELF FOR NEXT TURN:**\n**TIME TO ATTACK!** From (0,1), we'll have choices. We must MOVE RIGHT towards the center! Do NOT go further up the left wall into a dead end! We need to challenge his territory and force a confrontation! We're longer, we can win a head-on if we're smart! Let's box him in against our body! The hunt begins!\n\nUP",

If we go UP to (0,2), we're just climbing the wall, staying in our corner. That's playing DEFENSIVE! We can't let him farm the right side! We need to be AGGRESSIVE!\n\nGOING **RIGHT** to (1,1) is the AGGRESSIVE MOVE! It moves us TOWARDS the center, TOWARDS the enemy! We start cutting off his space! From (1,1), next turn we can go UP, RIGHT, or DOWN! We have so many options to pressure him! Our long body is a barrier he can't cross! We can trap him against it!\n\nIf we go UP, we're just delaying the inevitable and letting him get even longer uncontested! We have to challenge him NOW while we're the same length! LET'S BOX HIM IN! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\nRIGHT is the move! It's safe, it's aggressive, and it executes our long-term plan to dominate the board and force a confrontation! WE'RE NOT PLAYING FOR APPLES, WE'RE PLAYING FOR THE WIN! LET'S GO!\n\n**MESSAGE TO FUTURE SELF FOR NEXT TURN:**\n**PRESSURE! PRESSURE! PRESSURE!** From (1,1), we need to continue moving into the center! Our goal is to get between the enemy and the bulk of the apples on the right! Use our body as a wall to limit his movement! Force him into a bad spot! If we can get a head-on collision, we WIN! He's at 14, we're at 13, so we need to be careful, but if we can trap him, we can force a mistake!

If we go **UP** to (2,5), we're moving towards the top-left where there are apples, but are we giving him space? NO! Look at the board! His path upwards is blocked by HIS OWN BODY at (4,2), (5,3), etc. He's stuck down there! We need to use our superior positioning to slowly constrict him! Going UP keeps us safe, grabs future apples in the top-left, and maintains our height advantage to pounce later! We can't get greedy and dive down for a head-on collision yet; he's still longer! We need one more apple to tie the score!\n\n**THE VERDICT:** UP positions us for future content and keeps the pressure from above! LEFT feels too passive! WE STAY AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

None of those intersect with the only viable empty neighbor of my head, which is (5,2).  \n- **Apple chase** \u2013 Moving UP points my nose toward the vertical line of apples at x=5 (e.g., (5,9), (5,8), (5,7)\u2026) \u2013 perfect for climbing the right\u2011hand side and staying ahead of the rival\u2019s score.  \n- **Future options** \u2013 After stepping to (5,2) I\u2019ll still have LEFT (4,2), RIGHT (6,2), UP (5,3) and DOWN (5,1) as possible follow\u2011ups (the latter is now my tail cell, but since we\u2019re growing it\u2019ll be safe later).

HE'S STILL STUCK IN THAT COLUMN!\n\n**IMMEDIATE OPTIONS FROM (1,5):**\n\n*   **UP** to (1,6): IS IT SAFE? (1,6) is EMPTY on the board! \u2705 CHECKED! SAFE!\n*   **DOWN** to (1,4): IS IT SAFE? (1,4)... WAIT! Our body is at (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)... that's nowhere near (1,4)! The board shows (1,4) is EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **LEFT** to (0,5): IS IT SAFE? (0,5) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e AND it's EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE! FREE FOOD!\n*   **RIGHT** to (2,5): IS IT SAFE? (2,5) is our OWN BODY! Our old head position! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! CAN'T GO BACKWARDS!\n\nSO, UP, DOWN, and LEFT are all SAFE! THREE OPTIONS!\n\n**WHAT'S THE ENEMY GONNA DO?** From (5,2), his options are:\n*   UP to (5,3): HIS OWN BODY! \u274c DEATH!\n*   DOWN to (5,1): HIS OWN BODY! \u274c DEATH!\n*   LEFT to (4,2): EMPTY! \u2705\n*   RIGHT to (6,2): HIS OWN BODY! \u274c DEATH!\n\nHIS ONLY MOVE IS **LEFT** TO (4,2)! HE'S MOVING TOWARDS US! THIS IS OUR CHANCE!\n\n**OUR MASTER PLAN:** HE'S COMING LEFT! WE NEED TO INTERCEPT! \ud83e\udde0\n*   If we go LEFT to (0,5), we get the apple and tie the score! \ud83c\udf4e But that pulls us AWAY from the fight, giving him room to breathe. NO!\n*   If we go UP to (1,6), we're moving away vertically, which is also bad. He escapes!\n*   If we go **DOWN** to (1,4), WE ARE DIRECTLY CUTTING OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTE! From (1,4), next turn we can move RIGHT to (2,4) or (2,4) is our body? Wait, (2,4) is our body! So from (1,4), we can go RIGHT to (2,4)? NO, that's our body! We can go DOWN to (1,3) or LEFT to (0,4) to continue boxing him in! He's at (4,2) moving left. We can meet him in the middle and force a head-on collision WHEN WE HAVE THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! ONCE WE TIE THE SCORE, WE CAN FORCE THE ISSUE! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT FOR FUTURE SELF:** He's forced left to (4,2). We go DOWN to (1,4). Next turn, we can move to (1,3) or (0,4) to continue moving towards columns 2 or 3. He will likely go to (3,2) or (3,3). We need to cut off his path to the top-right open space. Herd him into the bottom-left corner where our massive body is! SURROUND AND CONQUER!\n\nDOWN",
