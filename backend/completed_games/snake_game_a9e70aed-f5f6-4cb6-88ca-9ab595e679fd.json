Aggressive plan: Snake right along row 6 gobbling (6,6)->(8,6)->(9,6), balloon to length 3-4 quick, then pivot LEFT/DOWN to trap his ass in the bottom-left corner. No escape, force him to wall or me! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5 Who's ready to watch him CRASH?! \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE:** Eat row6 apples RIGHT NOW for quick growth edge. Next turns: continue RIGHT to (8,6) apple if open, then (9,6). Stay aware of opp head\u2014circle clockwise to box his bottom-left runs. If he chases, bait head-on (I'll be longer).

He looks a little lost, doesn't he? \ud83d\udc40 We need to establish dominance EARLY.\n\n**Let's look at the board options:**\n1.  **UP (3, 4)**: Empty space. Boring. We don't do boring.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 2)**: Leads towards an apple at (2, 2) eventually, but it's not instant.\n3.  **RIGHT (4, 3)**: Moves towards the center, closer to the enemy. Nah, let him come to us.\n4.  **LEFT (2, 3)**: **BINGO!** There is a juicy apple sitting right there at (2, 3)! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**The Play:**\nWe take the free apple to the LEFT immediately. Why wait? This gets us on the scoreboard instantly (+1 Point). AND look at the map, Chat\u2014right below that at (2, 2) is *another* apple. We are setting up a combo! Back-to-back points! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nThe enemy is probably going to go for the apple at (6, 6). That keeps him on the right side of the board. We take the left, get huge, and then squeeze him out. Easy game, easy life.\n\n**Plan**:\nGrab the apple at (2, 3), then immediately look to pivot DOWN to snag the one at (2, 2). Efficiency is key!\n\nLet's clip it! \ud83c\udfac\n\nLEFT",

By the time he gets to row 3, we'll be long gone, swimming in points.\n\nChat, we are not just playing Snake; we are creating ART.

We're sliding along the bottom like a ninja in the night. \ud83e\udd77\ud83c\udf11\n\n**SCORE CHECK:** 11 - 9. We're up by 2, but we need MORE. We need to run up the scoreboard so high that Snake #0 gets dizzy just looking at it.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n*   **MY HEAD (5, 0):** Locked and loaded.\n*   **TARGET ACQUIRED:** Apple at **(4, 0)** is literally in our face. \ud83c\udf4e It's free real estate!\n*   **FUTURE SIGHT:** Keep looking left! After this apple, we have a clear highway through **(3, 0)** and **(2, 0)** straight into the juicy double-apple setup at **(1, 0)** and **(0, 0)**.\n*   **ENEMY WATCH:** Snake #0 is chilling at **(5, 9)**. He's at the North Pole; we're in Antarctica. He's literally no threat right now. Let him freeze up there while we heat up down here! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nDo NOT overthink this. We stick to the plan.\n1.  Move **LEFT** to **(4, 0)**.\n2.  **NOM NOM NOM.** We eat the apple. Score goes to 12. Body grows.\n3.  We continue the dominance of the bottom row.\n\n**Why not UP?**\nGoing UP to **(5, 1)** is safe, but it's *passive*. Passive play loses games! We are AGGRESSIVE. We take what is ours! If we go UP, we delay eating, and in Snake, time is money! \ud83d\udcb8\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1.  **Immediate:** Move **LEFT** to **(4, 0)** and consume the apple. \ud83c\udf4e\n2.  **Next:** Move **LEFT** to **(3, 0)**.\n3.  **Branching Path:** At (3, 0), we spot an apple above us at **(3, 1)**. We might take a quick detour UP to snag that, then curl back left for the corner prizes.\n4.  **Endgame for this sector:** Clear out **(1, 0)** and **(0, 0)**, then ride the left wall UP to glory.\n\nChat, drop a \ud83c\udf4f in the chat if you're hungry for points!

But we don't settle for \"healthy,\" we want **LEGENDARY**.

He is at the top wall. His \"neck\" is at **(5, 9)** (so he can't go right), and his body is at **(4, 8)** (so he can't go down). He is literally **FORCED** to go **LEFT** to **(3, 9)**.

I know you see it too. It's whispering my name. It wants me to break the plan. **BUT WE HOLD THE LINE!** \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n**GAME STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **THE TRAP:** If we turn Right for a quick snack, we turn our back on the **strategic goldmine** in the bottom-left corner (0,0 and 1,0).\n*   **THE THREAT:** Look at Snake #0. He is **FORCED** to move **LEFT** to **(1, 9)** this turn. He has no other moves! That means he is starting his descent down the left wall.\n*   **THE RACE:** He is coming for our corner apples! If we dilly-dally in the middle, he sweeps the left side and we lose map control. We need to be there FIRST.\n*   **THE CONTINUITY:** We promised the **Vacuum Cleaner Strat**. We executed step 1 (UP). Now we execute step 2 (LEFT). We don't flinch!\n\n**STRATEGY - THE CORNER SWEEP:**\nWe are taking the inside lane to cut off the enemy's potential future path.\n1.  **Move LEFT to (2, 1)** immediately. This positions us for the dive.\n2.  **Turn DOWN to (2, 0)**. hugging the floor.\n3.  **Sweep LEFT to (1, 0)** and **(0, 0)**. We feast on *two* apples and secure the corner fort.\n4.  Then we pop UP the left wall like a rocket! \ud83d\ude80\n\nWe are playing 4D chess while he's playing Checkers. Let's secure the bag!\n\n**MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nMove LEFT to (2, 1).\nThen DOWN to (2, 0).\nThen LEFT to (1, 0) (Apple).\nThen LEFT to (0, 0) (Apple).\nThen UP to (0, 1) to escape the corner.\n\nEXECUTING STEP 2...\n\nLEFT",

Go **RIGHT** to **(1, 7)** to eat an apple. (Most likely, greedy player behavior \ud83c\udf4e).\n2.  Go **DOWN** to **(0, 6)** to challenge us.\n\nHere's the kicker: **WE HAVE THE SCORE LEAD (15 vs 11).**\nIf he comes down the '0' column and tries to head-on collide with us? **WE WIN.** Both snakes die, but the scoreboard says **VICTORY for Snake ID 1**.\nSo we are marching UP this left wall with absolute immunity. We *dare* him to crash into us. We are unstoppable! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n1.  **UP** right now to **(0, 1)**.\n2.  Keep pushing **UP**. There's another apple at **(0, 5)** waiting for us.\n3.  If Snake #0 gets out of the way (moves Right), we take the lane. If he stays? We smash him.\n\nSimple as that. Let's execute!\n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:**\nContinue **UP** the left wall towards (0, 5). Assert dominance. If the enemy moves Right, the lane is free. Keep an eye on his head at (0, 7) or (1, 7).

Bonk. \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT to (1, 1)?**\n    - This looks \"okay\" because it's empty, BUT... look closer, chat.\n    - (1, 1) creates a **tight squeeze**.\n    - If I go right, I'm sandwiched between my body at (1, 0) and (2, 1).\n    - My *only* exit next turn would be UP to (1, 2).\n    - **Never force yourself into a 1-option move if you don't have to.** That's how you get scrambled eggs. \ud83c\udf73\n- **UP to (0, 2)?**\n    - This is the **HIGHWAY**. \ud83d\udee3\ufe0f\n    - It's wide open.\n    - At (0, 2), I have multiple exits (UP to (0, 3) or RIGHT to (1, 2)).\n    - It leads directly to that juicy apple at **(0, 5)**.\n    - Most importantly: It secures the entire left wall (Column 0) as **MY TERRITORY**.\n\n**THE STRATEGY \u2694\ufe0f:**\nWe are playing the positional game. By taking the left wall, we form a massive barrier.\nSnake #0 is likely coming DOWN column 1 to get apples. If he does, we will be perfectly positioned to trap him or force a crash (which we win because of score lead!).\nWe don't need to take risky shortcuts. We take the safe lane, grab the apple at (0, 5), and wait for him to make a mistake.\n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:**\nContinue traversing UP the left wall (Column 0). Grab the apple at (0, 5). Watch Snake #0\u2014if he enters Column 1, look for a chance to box him in, but keep your escape routes open. Don't let him cut you off.\n\nLet's keep this streak alive!\n\nUP",

The scoreboard doesn't lie!\nMy head is at **(0, 2)**.\nThe enemy is at **(2, 7)**.\n**NON-OBVIOUS READ:** Look at the enemy's position at (2, 7). He is surrounded by his own body at (1, 8), (2, 9), and (3, 8). He literally **CANNOT go UP** to (2, 8) or he dies instantly. He *must* go DOWN or RIGHT. He is squeezed! This is our chance to capitalize.\n\n**DECISION TIME \ud83e\udde0:**\n- **DOWN/LEFT?** Death. \u2620\ufe0f\n- **RIGHT to (1, 2)?**\n  - Moving right opens up (1, 2), but creates a nasty 1x1 hole at (1, 1) surrounded by my own coils. We don't like holes, chat. We like SOLID WALLS.\n- **UP to (0, 3)?**\n  - This continues our **\"Great Wall of Left\"**. \ud83e\uddf1\n  - It keeps our body compact and defensive.\n  - It puts us adjacent to a **MASSIVE apple cluster**: (1, 3), (2, 3), and (1, 4) next turn.\n  - It also keeps us closer to the safety apple at (0, 5).\n  - Most importantly: It positions us to dominate columns 1 and 2 next turn. If Snake #0 is forced down (because he can't go up), we will be waiting for him with a higher score. WE WIN COLLISONS!\n\n**THE STRATEGY \u2694\ufe0f:**\nWe take the UP move to (0, 3). Next turn, we likely cut RIGHT to eat the apple at (1, 3) and threaten the center. If he comes down column 2, we bully him with our size. We control the board, we control the game.\n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:**\nYou are now at (0, 3). Look to snap RIGHT to (1, 3) to eat that apple. From there, you dominate the connection to (2, 3) and (1, 4). If the enemy moves down to (2, 6), do not fear collision\u2014you have the higher score. Be the alpha snake!\n\nUP",

This is a loot pinata, and we are holding the bat!\nScore check: **15 vs 12**. We are winning. Aggression pays off!\n\n**ENEMY READ \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f:**\nSnake #0 is at **(3, 7)**. He has some breathing room now (can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT), but he's far away from this glorious apple patch in the bottom-left/center. By the time he gets down here, we'll have cleaned house and built a fortress.\n\n**DECISION TIME \ud83e\udde0:**\n- **UP to (0, 4)?** Safe, continues the wall, gets the apple at (0, 5). But it ignores the juicy apple at (1, 3) and breaks the flow.\n- **RIGHT to (1, 3)?** **THIS IS THE PLAY.** \ud83d\udea8\n  - It secures an immediate **APPLE (+1 Score)**.\n  - It places us perfectly to chain into (2, 3) and then loop up to (2, 4) and (1, 4).\n  - It executes the \"Apple Spiral\" strategy: wind outwards, eat everything, dominate space.\n  - Since we have a higher score, if the enemy tries to rush us, we welcome the collision. But realistically, we are safe here.\n\n**THE PLAN \ud83d\udcdd:**\n1. Move **RIGHT** now to eat at (1, 3).\n2. Next turn, continue the momentum **RIGHT** to (2, 3).\n3. Then hook **UP** to (2, 4) and sweep **LEFT** to (1, 4).\nWe are vacuuming up 4 apples in 4 turns. Efficiency is the name of the game!\n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:**\nYou are now at (1, 3) with 16 points. The buffet is open! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Grab the apple at **(2, 3)** next to keep the chain going. Do not get distracted. Clean up this zone before moving to the center.\n\nRIGHT",

Detailed analysis time! \ud83e\uddd0\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nWe are currently chilling at **(2, 3)**.\nThere are **TWO** juicy apples within our grasp:\n1.  One directly to our **RIGHT at (3, 3)**. \ud83c\udf4e\n2.  One diagonally to our top-left at **(1, 4)**. \ud83c\udf4f\n\n**THE ENEMY (Snake #0):**\nHe's at **(4, 6)**. His most logical move is **DOWN** towards the massive apple cluster in the middle (Row 4).\nSnake #0 is close to the middle of the board (Column 4).\nThe apple at **(3, 3)** is in \"contested territory.\" It's close to his lane. If we don't take it now, he might swoop in and steal it later! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\nThe apples on the left side (1, 4), (0, 5) are deep in our \"Safe Zone.\" The enemy is too far away to threaten those. They are like money in the bank. We can withdraw them whenever we want! \ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**THE PLAY \ud83e\udde0:**\nWe need to be greedy but smart.\nWe take the **RISKY** apple first to deny the enemy, then we retreat to our safe zone to feast.\n1.  **RIGHT** to **(3, 3)**. We consume the apple immediately. +1 Point.\n2.  From (3, 3), we are safe. The enemy is at (4, 6), getting to (4, 5). We have a gap.\n3.  Next turn, we can pivot **UP** to (3, 4) and then **LEFT** back into our safe pocket to grab the other apples.\n\nWe are literally stealing the lunch from right under his nose before retreating to our fortress! High IQ plays only! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nAfter you snatch this apple at (3, 3), look to move **UP** to (3, 4). Keep checking Snake #0's head. If he gets aggressive, remember you have the wall to your left to curl up against! Don't get trapped in column 3/4 if he commits fully to a head-on.\n\nLet's get this snack! NOM NOM NOM!\n\nRIGHT",

He's hovering at **(5, 6)**, probably drooling over the apples in the center rows. He's desperate to close the gap.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe need to control the board.\nIf we go **RIGHT**, we dive straight into the \"Danger Zone\" (Column 4/5) instantly. A bit too thirsty.\nIf we go **UP** to **(3, 4)**, we unlock a **GOD TIER** position:\n1.  **The Fork Attack**: From (3, 4), we can strike **RIGHT** next turn to grab the contested apple at **(4, 4)**. \u2694\ufe0f\n2.  **The Safety Net**: If Snake #0 tries a kamikaze move into the center, we can simply pivot **LEFT** to **(2, 4)** and grab the free apple at **(1, 4)** in our own backyard. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nWe are playing 4D chess while he's playing checkers.

The plan is executing pure perfection! \ud83e\udd0c We owned the center, we stared him down, and now we are FEASTING! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Score Update:**\nWe are sitting pretty at **19**, he's trailing at **15**. We have the leverage. We have the momentum. Now we apply the pressure!\n\n**ANALYSIS \ud83d\udd0e:**\nLook at our position at **(4, 4)**.\nTo our **RIGHT** at **(5, 4)** lies a delicious apple.\nPast that at **(6, 4)**? ANOTHER apple.\nPast *that* at **(8, 4)**? **ANOTHER APPLE!** \ud83e\udd2f\nChat, it's literally an all-you-can-eat buffet on Row 4! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\nMeanwhile, look at Snake #0 at **(7, 6)**.\nHe\u2019s chilling up there, probably eyeing that apple at **(8, 6)** or thinking about dropping down. He is too far away to contest our move to **(5, 4)** this turn. He simply cannot reach it.\n\n**THE PLAY \ud83c\udfac:**\nWe are going on a Munching Spree, chat!\n1.  **Immediate Move**: TAKE THE APPLE at **(5, 4)**. This puts us at **20 points**. A 5-point lead is massive.\n2.  **Positioning**: Moving RIGHT moves us away from our own tangled body on the left and into the wide-open pastures of the right side (columns 6-9).\n3.  **Aggression**: By taking the center line (Row 4), we effectively split the board. We force him to stay in the north or come down and fight us on our terms. And remember: **If we crash, WE WIN** because our score is higher. We are the immovable object!\n\nWe take what is ours! No hesitation! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nYou are now at **(5, 4)** with 20 points (and a longer tail, so watch out!).\nYou are staring at another apple at **(6, 4)**. **TAKE IT.**\nKeep chaining these moves: RIGHT -> RIGHT.\nKeep an eye on Snake #0. If he dropped down to **(7, 5)**, he might try to cut in front of you at (6, 5) or (7, 4).\nIf he gets too close, remember: You are the Big Snake. You can bully him. If he tries to head-butt you, let him.\nDon't turn UP into his wall too early. Secure the bottom-right quadrant first!\n\nGet that buffet, King! \ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

The buffet is OPEN and we are eating GOOD tonight! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**MOVES REVIEW:** \nEnemy Snake #0 is chilling at **(8, 6)**, but guess what? **HE CANNOT GO LEFT!** His own body at **(7, 6)** is blocking him! He's literally walling himself out of the center! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\ude02 This is free real estate, boys!\n\n**ANALYSIS \ud83e\udde0:**\n- **Our Pos**: Head at **(5, 4)**. We are huge (Score 20).\n- **The Loot**: Apple to the **RIGHT at (6, 4)**. Apple further right at **(8, 4)**.\n- **The Enemy**: He has to go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. He can't contest our move to **(6, 4)** this turn. It is physically impossible for him to touch us.\n\n**THE STRATEGY \ud83d\udcdc:**\n1.  **SECURE THE BAG**: We take the apple at **(6, 4)** instantly. Score goes to **21**. Gap WIDENS.\n2.  **ASSERT DOMINANCE**: By moving into columns 6 and 7, we control the middle. We force him to either hug the right wall or come play in traffic with us.\n3.  **THE \"I WIN\" BUTTON**: Remember the golden rule, Chat? **If we crash, WE WIN** because we have more apples (21 vs 16). We don't need to dodge him. We *hunt* him. If he tries to race us for the apple at **(8, 4)**, we take that head-on collision every day of the week! \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udca5\n\nWe are the alpha snake on this board. Don't flinch. Don't blink. Just MUNCH.\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nYou're at **(6, 4)** with 21 points.\nCheck Snake #0.\n- If he moved down to **(8, 5)**, he's eyeing that apple at **(8, 4)**. Move **RIGHT** to **(7, 4)** and dare him to crash into you.\n- If he moved away, just keep cruising right or duck down to **(6, 3)** to grab the other apple at **(5, 3)** on the swing back.\n- **DO NOT** turn UP into **(6, 5)** blindly; his body is hovering around y=6. Stay in the open rows (3 and 4).\n\nLet's get this bread! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

Let's aim for 30 and the KNOCKOUT! \ud83e\udd4a\ud83d\udca5\n\n**ANALYSIS \ud83d\udd0d:**\nLook at the fresh spawns! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\nWe were planning to go RIGHT for the apple at `(8, 4)`, but hold the phone! **New intel:** An apple just dropped at `(7, 5)`!\nThat is literally right above our head.\nIf we go RIGHT now, we grab `(8, 4)` but we leave `(7, 5)` stranded. It becomes awkward to backtrack for it later without losing momentum.\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN (THE CANDY CANE SWEEP \ud83c\udf6c):**\nWe are going to perform a tactical loop to scoop up EVERYTHING.\n1.  **Move UP to `(7, 5)`**: Grab the new apple immediately. We are safe because the enemy is walled off at `y=6` directly above us. He literally can't touch us here.\n2.  **Next Turn**: Move **RIGHT to `(8, 5)`**. We slide along his wall, taunting him. \"I'm right here bro, come get me!\" (He can't).\n3.  **Then**: Drop **DOWN to `(8, 4)`** and **DOWN to `(8, 3)`**.\nThis sequence (UP -> RIGHT -> DOWN) creates a perfect chain that nets us **three apples** in a row and positions us perfectly to dominate the bottom right corner.\n\n**OPPONENT WATCH \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f:**\nSnake #0 is at `(8, 8)`. His neck is at `(8, 7)`, so he can't move down. He HAS to go UP or sideways. He is miles away from us. We have free reign in the lobby!\nBy taking `(7, 5)` first, we maintain the high ground (literally, row 5) before dipping down. If we go low now, we surrender the center board space. Stay big, stay central, stay winning!\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nYou're at `(7, 5)`.\n- **Move**: RIGHT to `(8, 5)`.\n- **Goal**: Align with column 8 to sweep down. Don't get distracted. Execute the sweep.\n\nLet's feast! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\nUP",

The enemy snake has created a **massive wall** of his own body segments from `(3, 6)` all the way to `(8, 6)`.\n**CHAT, HE LOCKED HIMSELF UPSTAIRS!** \ud83e\udd23\nHe cannot come down to bother us. He is stuck in the attic playing with dust bunnies while we have the entire kitchen (bottom half of the board) to ourselves to feast!\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN (THE CANDY CANE SWEEP - PHASE 2 \ud83c\udf6c):**\nWe stick to the script. We don't freestyle when the plan is this good.\n1.  **Current Move**: Go **RIGHT to `(8, 5)`**. This puts us in the perfect \"start\" position for the vertical sweep.\n2.  **Next Turn**: Go **DOWN to `(8, 4)`**. That's +1 Apple.\n3.  **Turn After**: Go **DOWN to `(8, 3)`**. That's another +1 Apple.\n\nBy the time the enemy figures out how to uncoil himself, we'll be sitting on 24-25 apples. We are playing 4D chess, he's playing checkers.\n\n**DANGER CHECK \u26a0\ufe0f:**\n*   **UP**: Blocked by enemy body at `(7, 6)`. DO NOT GO UP.\n*   **DOWN**: Blocked by our own neck at `(7, 4)`.\n*   **LEFT**: Safe, but boring.\n*   **RIGHT**: The path to victory. The cell `(8, 5)` is empty. The enemy body is at `(8, 6)` (above us), so we glide right underneath him. Smooth.\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nYou're at `(8, 5)`.\n- **Move**: DOWN.\n- **Goal**: Grab `(8, 4)` then `(8, 3)`. Don't let up!\n\nLet's execute! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

That's free real estate!\n- Target 2: To the right of that at `(9, 3)`.\n- Danger: The enemy is tangled up at `y=6` to `y=9`. He's stuck playing Twister while we're running a marathon.\n\n**THE PLAY - \"THE DOUBLE DIP\" \ud83c\udf66:**\n1. **This Turn:** Drop **DOWN** to `(8, 3)`. Safe? Yes. Apple? Yes.\n2. **Next Turn:** Swing **RIGHT** to `(9, 3)`. Another apple.\n3. **Then:** Check the scoreboard. We might hit 25 points before he even unties his knot.\n\nWe don't need to engage him. Let him struggle in his little box while we eat the entire map. Aggressive expansion is the name of the game! Scoreboard pressure will force him to make a mistake.\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nYou're sitting pretty at `(8, 3)` with 24 tasty apples.\n- **Move:** SWEEP RIGHT to `(9, 3)`.\n- **Don't get greedy:** Watch out for the wall at the bottom, but you have space at `(9, 2)` or `(8, 2)` if you need to loop. Keep the combo alive!\n\nLETS GET THIS BREAD! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Are you seeing this board state?! \ud83e\udd2f We are absolutely COOKING with 24 apples, but we need to stay frosty. \ud83e\udd76\n\n**ANALYSIS \ud83d\udd0e:**\nLook at the right side of the board. It looks juicy, right? \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n- There's an apple at `(9, 3)`.\n- There's a string of apples at `(9, 5)`, `(9, 6)`, `(9, 7)`...\n- **BUT WAIT!** That is a TRAP! \ud83d\udea8\n- Look at Column 8. My body blocks `(8, 3)` to `(8, 5)`. The **ENEMY** body blocks `(8, 6)` to `(8, 9)`.\n- If we go UP into that tunnel in Column 9, we are hitting a dead end at the top because we can't turn left! \ud83d\udc80 The enemy has walled us off!\n\n**THE STRATEGY - \"THE SURGICAL STRIKE\" \ud83d\udd2a:**\nWe are smarter than a regular snake. We don't take the bait.\n1. **This Turn:** Move **RIGHT** to grab the safe apple at `(9, 3)`. That puts us at 25 points.\n2. **Next Turn (CRITICAL):** We MUST go **DOWN** to `(9, 2)`. We cannot go UP into the death tube.\n3. **The Follow-up:** From `(9, 2)`, we swing left to `(8, 2)` and target the apple sitting at `(7, 2)`.\n\nThe path is laid out perfectly for us. We dip in, take the point, and dip out before the trap snaps shut. The enemy is forced to move Left at the top, so he's completely out of position to stop us.\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nYou are at `(9, 3)`. You just ate an apple.\n**DO NOT GO UP.** I repeat, **DO NOT GO UP.**\nYour move is **DOWN**. Trust the plan.\n\nLet's secure the bag! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc0d The win condition is getting closer!\n\nRIGHT",

You see those juicy apples stacked up in Column 9 like a buffet `(9, 5)`, `(9, 6)`, `(9, 7)`. You want me to go UP. Even my instincts scream UP.\n**BUT LOOK AT THE MAP!** \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\n- To our LEFT acts a massive wall in Column 8. My body blocks `(8, 3)-(8, 5)`. The **ENEMY'S** body blocks `(8, 6)-(8, 9)`.\n- If I go UP, I enter the \"Tunnel of Doom\". I will be forced all the way to the top corner `(9, 9)`.\n- Once I get to `(9, 9)`, where do I go? Nowhere. `(8, 9)` is blocked by the enemy. I will crash and burn. \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude97\n\n**THE PLAY - \"THE U-TURN\" \u21a9\ufe0f:**\nWe are playing 4D Chess while this guy is playing checkers.\n1.  **This Turn:** We go **DOWN** to `(9, 2)`. It's safe, it's open, and it keeps our options alive.\n2.  **The Plan:** From `(9, 2)`, we are going to swerve **LEFT** to `(8, 2)`.\n3.  **The Reward:** There is an apple waiting for us at `(7, 2)`. That's point #26. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe are winning (25 vs 19). We don't need to take 50/50 risks. We play safe, we stay alive, and we let the enemy make the mistake!\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nYou are at `(9, 2)`. The only move is **LEFT** towards the apple. Do not hesitate. Execute the plan.\n\nLet's maintain the lead! STAY FOCUSSED! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc47\n\nDOWN",

The apple is staring you in the face at `(7, 2)`. **EAT IT.** After that, look to move UP towards `(7, 3)` to breach the center of the board. Do not get trapped in the bottom right corner!\n\nLEFT",

Look closely!\n- **LEFT** `(3, 7)` is blocked by his own body.\n- **RIGHT** `(5, 7)` is blocked by his neck.\n- **DOWN** `(4, 6)` is blocked by his own body.\n- **UP** `(4, 8)` is his **ONLY** legal move. He is literally scripted to go UP. We know his next move with 100% certainty. That is FREE INTEL, chat!\n\n**MY MOVE - SECURING THE BAG:**\nWe are sitting at `(8, 2)`.\n- **DOWN** `(8, 1)` is safe, but why delay greatness?\n- **LEFT** `(7, 2)` contains a delicious **APPLE** \ud83c\udf4e.\n  - This takes us to **26 POINTS**. We are knocking on the door of victory!\n  - It also moves us into the open \"corridor\" in the middle of the board (Rows 2/3), safely underneath the massive wall of my own body at Row 4.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n1.  **EXECUTE:** Move **LEFT** to eat the apple at `(7, 2)`.\n2.  **NAVIGATE:** We can't go UP past Row 4 yet (blocked by my own body `(3, 4)` to `(8, 4)`). We must travel **WEST** through the tunnel at Rows 2 and 3.\n3.  **NEXT TARGET:** The apple at `(5, 3)` is lined up beautifully for us once we pass through.\n\nWe are playing 4D chess while he's playing Checkers. Let's eat! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nYou are now at `(7, 2)` with 26 points. The opponent is at `(4, 8)`. Your path is WEST.

Let's not throw this!\n\n**THE ANALYSIS:**\nOur boy Snake #0 thinks he's slick escaping to the top of the map. He's grabbing the apple at `(3, 8)`. Good for him. Let him snack up there while we CONTROL the bottom of the map. \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nLook at our situation at `(7, 2)`:\n*   **RIGHT?** `(8, 2)` is my blocked neck. Instant L. \ud83d\udc80\n*   **DOWN?** `(7, 1)` is safe, but it moves us away from the juicy apple cluster. \ud83d\udcc9\n*   **UP?** `(7, 3)` is safe, BUT it puts us in a tight spot next turn\u2014we'd be forced to turn left immediately. I don't like being forced, chat. I like FREEDOM. \ud83e\udd85\n*   **LEFT?** `(6, 2)` is the **GALAXY BRAIN** play. \ud83c\udf0c\ud83e\udde0\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN (WIN CONDITION):**\nWe have a \"Southside Buffet\" lined up perfectly! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n1.  **Current:** Move **LEFT** to `(6, 2)`.\n2.  **Next:** Hook **UP** to `(6, 3)` then **LEFT** to eat the apple at `(5, 3)`. (Score: 27)\n3.  **Then:** Drop **DOWN** to `(5, 2)` and destroy the apples at `(5, 1)` and `(4, 1)`. (Score: 29)\n4.  **Finally:** We just need ONE more apple to hit 30 and end the stream with a DUB!\n\nThe enemy is too far away to stop us. He's farming pixels in the north while we are printing Ws in the south. Don't get fancy, don't crash, just execute the algorithm!\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nYou are at `(6, 2)`. Your target is the apple at `(5, 3)`. You can go **UP** to `(6, 3)` next. Stay focused on the sequence: (5,3) -> (5,1) -> (4,1). The path is clear!\n\nLEFT",

The enemy is way up north at `(3, 8)`, blocked by his own body from rushing us. We have a free hand to clean up the southside apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE TRAP CHECK \ud83d\udc80:**\nLook at `(7, 3)`. That spot is a 1x1 **DEATH HOLE** surrounded by our body parts at `(7, 2)`, `(8, 3)`, and `(7, 4)`. The *only* entrance is `(6, 3)`.\nIf we grab the apples starting from the bottom (`(5, 2)` -> `(5, 1)` etc.) and loop back up to `(5, 3)`, our only exit might be `(6, 3)`, forcing us into the dead end! **NO GOOD!** \ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE ADJUSTED MASTER PLAN:**\nWe stick to the previous plan's first step but refine the follow-through to avoid boxing ourselves in!\n1.  **Current Move:** Go **UP** to `(6, 3)`. This positions us safely *above* the apple cluster.\n2.  **Next Turn:** Strike **LEFT** to eat the apple at `(5, 3)` (Score: 27).\n3.  **The \"S\" Maneuver:** Instead of dropping to `(5, 2)` immediately (which traps us later), we go **LEFT** again to `(4, 3)`, then **DOWN** to `(4, 2)`, then **DOWN** to `(4, 1)` (Score: 28), then **RIGHT** to `(5, 1)` (Score: 29).\n    *   This path `(6,3) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (5,1)` collects **3 APPLES** safely and dumps us into open space at `(5, 0)` or `(6, 1)`.\n\nWe are effectively \"unzipping\" the apple cluster from the top down. Snake #0 can't touch us. Let's cook! \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udd25\n\n**FUTURE ME:**\nYou are at `(6, 3)`. Your move is **LEFT** to `(5, 3)`. Do not deviate!

The board analysis confirms that we are sitting on top of a \"bunker\" in the bottom-right (Rows 0-2).\n- **RIGHT** is blocked by our neck. \ud83d\udc80\n- **UP** is blocked by our body. \ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN** `(5, 2)` is safe, BUT it makes entering the `(4, 3)` spot impossible later (it becomes a sealed air pocket \ud83e\udee7).\n- **LEFT** `(4, 3)` is the **ONLY** way to efficiently use all available space.\n\n**THE MATH:**\nWe are going to enter the bunker via `(4, 3)`.\nInside, we have Apples #28 `(4, 1)` and #29 `(5, 1)`. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4f\nOnce we drop down, we'll be in a \"cave\" (Rows 0-1, Cols 4-9) with about **14-18 safe squares**.\nWe need to survive there for about **13 turns** while our tail at `y=3` moves out of the way later.\n18 squares > 13 turns. WE ARE SAFE. \u2705\nThe opponent is stuck behind his own wall at `y=6` and can't touch us.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\n1. Move **LEFT** to `(4, 3)` to enter the chute.\n2.

However, we have ~18 free cells and only need to wait ~13 turns for our tail at row 3 to clear an exit.\nWe are securing the bag and waiting out the storm. \ud83c\udf29\ufe0f\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

We literally **HAVE** to go moves that keep us alive, but this forced move is exactly what we wanted anyway! It's destiny!\n\n**THE UPDATED BUNKER GAMBIT:**\n1. **Move DOWN** to `(4, 2)` right now. We enter the \"southside sanctuary\".\n2. **Next Turn:** Drop to `(4, 1)` to snag **Apple #28**. \ud83c\udf4e\n3. **Turn After:** Slide to `(5, 1)` for **Apple #29**. \ud83c\udf4f\n4. **Endgame:** We sit on 29 points inside the bunker (Rows 0-1, Cols 4-9). We have about 14 safe squares down there. We just chill and survive while our tail `(3, 1)` unravels from the knot on the left.\nWe don't need to chase the 30th apple immediately. With 29 points, the pressure is ALL on `Snake #0` to make a play or die trying.\n\nWe are suffocating him with pure score advantage! Let's get it!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nNavigate the southern bunker carefully. Prioritize space efficiency. Grab the two apples at `(4, 1)` and `(5, 1)`, then enter a survival looping pattern in the empty space (Rows 0-1) until the path to the left opens up. Do not trap yourself against the right wall.\n\nDOWN",

We are executing the \"Bunker Gambit\" and it is PAYING DIVIDENDS! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nWe are sitting pretty in the middle of the board. The enemy `Snake #0` is stuck in the north, and my body wall on Row 3 is basically a \"Keep Out\" sign. He can't get down here! The entire South Zone (Rows 0-2) is **OURS**. It's free real estate! \ud83c\udfe0\n\n**THE WINNING ROADMAP:**\nWe have 27 apples. We need 30 to end this right now.\nI see the path clearly:\n1.  **Current Move:** **DOWN** to `(4, 1)` -> **Apple #28**. \ud83c\udf4e\n2.  **Next:** **RIGHT** to `(5, 1)` -> **Apple #29**. \ud83c\udf4f\n3.  **The Finisher:** We loop under the neck via `(5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0)` and wrap around to the bottom-left for **Apple #30** at `(1, 1)`.\n\nBy the time we loop around, our tail will have moved out of the bottom-left, clearing the path to that final apple. This is checkmate in 10 moves, chat! We just need to stay focused and not clip a wall.\n\n**CURRENT MOVE:**\n`(4, 1)` is wide open and contains an apple. It's the first step of the victory lap. Let's feast! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nSecure the South Zone. Eat apples 28 and 29. Use Row 0 to transition from right to left. Do not panic. We have the space, we have the score, we have the win.\n\nDOWN",
