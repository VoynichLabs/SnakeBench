Head at (2,1), no body yet, but we're about to GROW like a BOSS and box this fool in! Enemy at (5,7) \u2013 he's wide open, but we're not rushing for a tie like idiots. Scores tied at zero, hell nah, we don't do head-ons yet! Gotta EAT first, build that length, get the score edge, then SMASH him into a corner! \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLet's survey the battlefield: All directions safe? HELL YEAH! No off-board, no bodies (yet), no self-hits. We're like a blank canvas of dominance! Up to (2,2) \u2013 BAM, immediate apple! \ud83d\udc40 That's (2,2) with that juicy 'A' callin' my name. Eat it, grow by one, body pops at (2,1), snakes become 2 long. Future options from there? Massive! Up, left, right \u2013 I can zig-zag, control the space without gettin' bottlenecked. Why not up? It keeps my escape routes OPEN, avoids tight spots, and straight-up FARM THAT APPLE! Down to (2,0)? Empty spot, no apple nearby, kinda bottom-corner-ish, might trap me later if I play scared. Left to (1,1)? Also empty, near bottom, no grow there. Right to (3,1)? Open, but hungry \u2013 next apple might be (3,3) up a bit, or (3,0) down, but why waste time? UP is aggressive, grows me, positions for board control towards the center where this rat is lurkin'. Enemy might try snakin' down for (5,2) or left for (0,7), but we're cuttin' him off once we're longer! \ud83d\ude08\n\nFuture plan for my ruthless self: Grow fast, aim up or right next to chain apples like (3,3) or (5,2) if possible, build length to 3-4, then pivot aggressively left/up to box enemy towards the edges. Don't let him push you; force him into walls or your trail if you outscore him! Keep multiple exits, stay mobile! \ud83d\udcaa\u265f\ufe0f\n\nUP",

Moving RIGHT also keeps me away from the edges, leaving up, down, left, and even another right open for the following turn, so I stay flexible and avoid getting boxed in.  \n\nLEFT would just drift me away from any immediate growth, while UP and DOWN feel like wasted momentum.  \n\nPlan: grab that apple on the next move, then reassess the board for a push toward the centre while watching the rival\u2019s head.

Aggro gold with endless zigzags\u2014why squander on weak left when RIGHT's the BOARD CRUSHER? \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT'S OUR VENOM\u2014eats nothing, but BUILDS to eat BIG (next apple (2,8) or beyond), keeps tons of pivots (up/right/down flips), charges enemy turf without suicidin', maintains score gap watch (gonna FORCE that collision soon!), dodges likely DOWNS he might pull. Enemy heads: DOWN/lookin' scared, we chase; UP for (8,9) apple? No apple list, but we grow faster anyway! Plan for FUT self: Ate last, now RIGHT to (2,4)\u2014force UP next if RIGHT blocked, steal (2,8) for +1 (score 3!), then right or up to (3,5) apple highway, monitor his RIGHT/DOWN shenanigans, zigzag ever-right/up to sandwich his (7-8,7-8) bodies against edges, grow to 4+ then slaw toward head-on feelers if edge flips! Don't let him loop away\u2014dominate center stacks ((3,3),(5,2),(5,5),(3,5)), box his tail into walls above, MAKE him crash me or smash my web! Crush him, fam\u2014he's history! \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT\n\n(raw strategy note to self: RIGHT taken, focus grow via UP next to (2,5) or RIGHT more\u2014aim (2,8) eat for tiebreaker. Watch enemy RIGHT/DOWN moves; build length to 4, then aggro right/up columns to close his space, force error into bodies or heads. Keep central, avoid Low edges. Win by fattening + collision.) \n\nRIGHT",

Safe, keeps three future safe exits (up, down, left). Also moves us away from our tail and opens a path toward the (9,2) apple after we grow.  \n\u2705 DOWN \u2192 empty cell (5,1). Safe, but only two future safe exits (down to apple at (5,0) or left). Slightly less flexibility.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Rhetorical: Do we want to stay aggressive and chase a head\u2011on when we already lead, or play it smart and keep options wide open? Which move maximizes future routes?\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Long\u2011term plan for future self:  \n- Keep growing until we hit 7+ apples, then aim for the (9,2) apple on the far right.  \n- Use the extra length to box the rival into a corner near (5,3).  \n- Avoid head\u2011on collisions unless we\u2019re certain we have the higher score.\n\nGiven the analysis, the safest and most option\u2011rich move is LEFT.  \nLEFT",
