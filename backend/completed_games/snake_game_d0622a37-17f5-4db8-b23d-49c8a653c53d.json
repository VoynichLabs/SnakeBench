My last move LEFT was successful and I'm now positioned well to pursue the apple at (0, 8).\n\n**Current Position Analysis:**\n- My head is at (2, 9) - near the top-left area\n- My body extends: (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8)\n- I'm 6 segments long total\n\n**Safety Check:**\n- UP: Would go to (2, 10) - OUT OF BOUNDS, DEATH\n- DOWN: Would go to (2, 8) - safe, empty space\n- LEFT: Would go to (1, 9) - safe, empty space  \n- RIGHT: Would go to (3, 9) where my body is - DEATH\n\nSo I have two safe options: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\nAvailable apples: (0, 8), (7, 0), (0, 0), (8, 1), (7, 6)\n\nThe apple at (0, 8) is my closest target:\n- If I go LEFT to (1, 9): Apple would be 1 left + 1 down = 2 moves away\n- If I go DOWN to (2, 8): Apple would be 2 left + 0 moves vertically = 2 moves away\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nGoing LEFT continues my planned path toward the (0, 8) apple. From (1, 9), I could then go LEFT to (0, 9), then DOWN to (0, 8) to grab it. This seems like the most direct route.\n\nGoing DOWN to (2, 8) would require me to go LEFT twice then UP once to reach (0, 8), which might be slightly more complex pathfinding.\n\n**Enemy Snake Check:**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 1) in the lower portion - still far away and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll continue LEFT toward (1, 9) to maintain my direct path to the apple at (0, 8). This keeps me moving efficiently toward my target.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving LEFT to (1, 9), I'll go LEFT again to (0, 9), then DOWN to (0, 8) to collect that apple. After that, I can reassess and potentially target other apples while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nLEFT"
