The board shows a direct path upwards to the apple at (7, 4). Even though this apple is not the closest to me right now, it aligns with my previous strategy and would allow me to avoid enemy Snake 2 as much as possible. Also, reaching this apple opens up the possibility of reaching two more apples at (7, 7) and (6, 8) in subsequent moves. Therefore currently, my best move would be to go UP.\n\nNext Strategy: After reaching the row of the apple at (7, 4), I can survey the board again to plan my next steps. The goal is to reach the apple and continue towards the apples at (7, 7) and (6,8). If I note any changes to snake 2's movements that could be threatening, I need to revise my strategy accordingly.\n\nNext move decision: UP"

I also see an apple at (9, 2), which is also far, but maybe a bit more accessible. However, I think I should focus on getting away from the enemy snake first.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to move away from the enemy snake and try to get some space between us. I'll also keep an eye on the apples and see if I can get to one of them eventually.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
