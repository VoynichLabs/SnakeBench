Since we move simultaneously, I must consider if the enemy might move into the same cell as me, causing a head-on collision.\n     - If I move UP to (2, 1), the enemy could move DOWN to (2, 7), which is not (2, 1), so no head-on collision.\n     - If I move LEFT to (1, 0), the enemy could move RIGHT to (3, 8), not (1, 0), so no head-on collision.\n     - If I move RIGHT to (3, 0), the enemy could move LEFT to (1, 8), not (3, 0), so no head-on collision.\n   - Therefore, no immediate head-on collision risk with the current enemy position.\n\n4) Among the safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), I want to:\n   - Move closer to apples to increase the chance of eating one.\n   - Keep future options open (avoid tight spaces or dead-ends).\n\nApples are at: (6, 7), (7, 8), (5, 4), (6, 2), (9, 4)\n\n- Moving UP to (2, 1) brings me closer to the apple at (6, 2) (Manhattan distance: |6-2| + |2-1| = 5).\n- Moving LEFT to (1, 0) increases distance to all apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 0) brings me closer to (6, 2) (Manhattan distance: |6-3| + |2-0| = 5), same as UP, but RIGHT also brings me closer to (5, 4) (|5-3| + |4-0| = 6 vs |5-2| + |4-0| = 7).\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, RIGHT seems better because it moves me closer to two apples instead of one. LEFT is worse in all cases.\n\n5) Check future options:\n- From (2, 1) (UP), next moves could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is off board).\n- From (3, 0) (RIGHT), next moves could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is off board).\nBoth have similar future flexibility, but RIGHT is better for apple proximity.\n\n6) Long-term plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 0) to start moving toward the apples at (6, 2) and (5, 4).\n- Avoid the enemy snake at (2, 8) by not moving directly toward it; it is far away vertically, so no immediate collision risk.\n- Try to eat apples while maintaining space to maneuver and avoid dead-ends.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT",

So only UP and RIGHT are valid.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:\n- UP moves me toward the (9,1) apple with a Manhattan distance of 2\n- RIGHT also moves me toward (9,1) with a Manhattan distance of 2\n- UP opens more space above me, potentially giving more future options\n- RIGHT keeps me closer to the bottom wall, which might limit future options\n\nLong-term strategy:\n- The enemy snake is still long and occupying the top area\n- I should focus on the apples in the top-right corner (9,1) and (9,2)\n- Moving UP now would:\n  - Keep me safe from the enemy snake\n  - Move me closer to the (9,1) apple\n  - Open more space for future moves\n  - Avoid getting trapped in the bottom-right corner\n- After moving UP, I can continue toward (9,1) or (9,2)\n- This move keeps me away from the enemy while efficiently collecting apples\n\nUP",
