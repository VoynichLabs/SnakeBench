We're starting at (0, 8) and our opponent, Snake #0, is waaay over at (8, 8). We got the whole left side of the board to ourselves, for now. But we gotta be quick and aggressive! No dawdling!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 0):**\n*   **My position (1):** (0, 8). Short snake, zero apples. Fresh start!\n*   **Opponent's position (0):** (8, 8). Also short, zero apples.\n*   **Board Size:** 10x10.\n*   **Immediate Goal:** Get some territory, maybe grab an early apple, and scope out the enemy's likely first move.\n\n**Where can I move from (0, 8)?**\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 9):** Safe. Gets us closer to the apple at (0, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 7):** Safe. Opens the board.\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 8):** IMPOSSIBLE! Off the board. \ud83d\udea8 RED CARD!\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 8):** Safe. Moves us towards the center.\n\nAll three safe moves are solid, but which one gives us the best early advantage?\n\n**Considering the Opponent (Snake #0 at 8, 8):**\nSnake #0 is probably going to move towards the center or maybe try to grab the apple at (9, 8).\n*   *Likely moves for (8, 8):* UP (to 8, 9), DOWN (to 8, 7), LEFT (to 7, 8), RIGHT (to 9, 8 - an apple!)\n\nIf they go **RIGHT** to (9, 8), they get an early lead. We really don't want that, do we, chat?\n\n**My Strategy: Vertical Control and Early Apple:**\nThe apple at (0, 9) is right there! Hitting that apple immediately gives us a body segment and gets us on the scoreboard. Plus, it solidifies our control of the left edge. The enemy is far away, so no immediate collision worries.\n\n1.  **Move UP:** Eat the apple at (0, 9). Head to (0, 9). We gain +1 length and +1 apple. This is the optimal aggressive move for turn 1.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** After securing the top-left corner, start moving right along the top edge (9-row) to assess the situation and look for the next apple or an opportunity to pressure the opponent who is likely also growing. We need to dominate the edges before venturing into the crowded center!\n\nLet's grab this apple and get this stream POPPING! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n\nUP",

UP to (8,9) empty, DOWN (8,7) clear, LEFT (7,8) ghost town, RIGHT (9,8) **APPLE CITY** \ud83c\udf4e. Enemy's too far left to clown on me this turn.\n\nWhy RIGHT?

We're not simpin' for defense\u2014we're predators! \ud83d\udc0d Crush his options later when I'm longer. LEFT tempts towards him, but why chase when I can EAT and set traps? UP/DOWN?

The scoreboard is tied 1-1, but we got the momentum! LET'S GO!\n\n### Turn 1 Analysis: Box Him In!\n\n**Current State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1, Length 2):** Head at (0, 9), Body/Tail at (0, 8). We own the top-left!\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0, Length 2):** Head at (9, 8), Body/Tail at (8, 8). He also grabbed an apple (likely at (9, 8) or (8, 9), based on his previous position at (8, 8) and his current head position. The board shows his tail at (8, 8) and head at (9, 8), indicating he moved RIGHT from (8, 8) to (9, 8) and collected an apple.) He owns the top-right!\n*   **Goal:** We need to start dominating territory and pressuring him before he can secure the top edge. We are currently facing the edge of the board.\n\n**Where can I move from (0, 9)?**\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 10):** IMPOSSIBLE! Off the board (9, 9 is the top). \ud83d\udea8 RED CARD!\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 8):** Into our own body (tail). INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 NOPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 9):** IMPOSSIBLE! Off the board. \ud83d\udea8 RED CARD!\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 9):** SAFE! Moves us towards the dangerous center line and allows us to start claiming the *top row*.\n\n**Result of Step 2 (Elimination):** Only **RIGHT** is a safe, available move.\n\n**Strategy Consideration (Moving RIGHT to (1, 9)):**\n\nMoving right along the top edge (row 9) is crucial. We force the enemy to decide quickly if they are going to compete for the top row or drop down.\n\n*   If he continues along the top edge (likely moving LEFT to (8, 9) or (7, 9)), we maintain a parallel path toward a potential head-to-head confrontation, which is great for controlling the board.\n*   The path is clear for several segments (at least up to (7, 9)).\n\n**Intermediate Goal:** Snake along the top edge (row 9) and seize control of that valuable real estate.\n\n**The Enemy's Likely Move (Snake 0 at (9, 8)):**\nHe is at (9, 8).\n*   He is blocked by the edge to the RIGHT.\n*   He is blocked by his tail at (8, 8) if he goes DOWN (to (9, 7) then back), or LEFT to (8, 8) (instant death). Wait, his head is (9, 8) and tail is (8, 8). He cannot move LEFT to (8, 8) because that is his body. He is dangerously close to the corner.\n    *   **UP to (9, 9):** Safe. Keeps him on the top edge.\n    *   **DOWN to (9, 7):** Safe. Drops him down the right wall.\n    *   **LEFT to (8, 8):** CRASH! Into his own body/tail at (8, 8). He won't do this.\n    *   **RIGHT to (10, 8):** CRASH! Off the board.\n\nThe opponent is likely to move **UP to (9, 9)** to complete control of the top-right corner. This is exactly what we want, as it forces him into an aggressive posture towards the center while we take control of the left half of row 9.\n\n**Our Choice:** We must move RIGHT. It's the only way to avoid instantly losing, and it advances our strategic position! Let's own this top boundary!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\nKeep moving RIGHT along the boundary (0-9, 1-9, 2-9...). Press the enemy. Force him to move DOWN into the center or risk a collision trying to cut us off. If we get the upper hand on length, we force the confrontation.\n\nRIGHT",

We secured the top-left, and now we're marching across the top edge! \ud83e\udd11\n\n### Turn 2 Analysis: The Top Lane Takeover\n\n**Current State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1, Length 2):** Head at (1, 9), Body/Tail at (0, 9). We are owning the top boundary!\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0, Length 2):** Head at (9, 7), Body/Tail at (9, 8). Wait, hold up! Let's check his move from Turn 1.\n    *   *Previously:* Head (9, 8), Body (8, 8).\n    *   *Now:* Head (9, 7), Body (9, 8).\n    *   **Opponent's Move:** He moved **DOWN** from (9, 8) to (9, 7). He decided *not* to compete for the top edge! Interesting. Maybe he saw us coming or didn't like the look of that corner. This is GREAT for us! We have clear top-row control!\n\n**Our Head is at (1, 9). Where can we go?**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 10):** IMPOSSIBLE! Off the board (9, 9 is the top). \ud83d\udea8 RED CARD!\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 8):** SAFE! This opens up a path to the mid-board.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 9):** CRASH! Into our body/tail. INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 9):** SAFE! Continues our territorial expansion along the top edge, moving away from our tail.\n\n**Result of Step 2 (Elimination):** We have two safe moves: **DOWN** to (1, 8) or **RIGHT** to (2, 9).\n\n**Strategy Consideration: Dominating the Edge**\n\nSince the opponent has voluntarily dropped down the right wall (now at (9, 7)), the entire top row is ours for the taking! This is prime real estate for setting up a boundary trap later.\n\n*   **Option 1: RIGHT to (2, 9):** This move perfectly executes our current plan: secure the top boundary. It keeps us far away from the opponent (who is 8 cells away). This solidifies our position and gives us maximum safety and control.\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (1, 8):** This also keeps us safe, but we are moving away from our current strategic goal of boundary control. It might be slightly less predictable, but occupying the top edge first seems like the better long-term power play.\n\nWe are going to stick to the plan and claim as much of the top wall as we can before dropping down. We want to *force* the opponent to react to us, not the other way around!\n\n**The Enemy's Likely Move (Snake 0 at (9, 7)):**\nHe just moved DOWN. He is likely to continue moving DOWN along the right wall to (9, 6) or (9, 5). He is consolidating position on the right side. We must consolidate on the top/left!\n\n**Decision:** Moving RIGHT to (2, 9) extends our territory, maintains maximum distance from the opponent, and keeps all future moves safe and open for now. EZ clap!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\nContinue advancing right along the top edge (row 9). We will stake our claim up to at least (7, 9) or (8, 9) and then decide whether to box him in by dropping down (e.g., at (8, 8)) or forcing him into the middle. The faster we grow by eating apples, the more dangerous our body becomes as a barrier. No rush for apples yet, just tactical movement.\n\nRIGHT",

Take a look at the board, look at the dominance!\n\n### Turn 3 Analysis: Solidifying the Wall\n\n**Current State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1, Length 2):** Head at (2, 9), Body/Tail at (1, 9). We just moved RIGHT. We are the King of Row 9!\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0, Length 2):** Head at (9, 6), Body/Tail at (9, 7). He is digging in on the right wall.\n\n**The Enemy's Move from Turn 2:**\nHe moved DOWN from (9, 7) to (9, 6), cementing his right-side occupation. We are now extremely far apart, which is great for building up our territory and controlling the center later.\n\n**Our Head is at (2, 9). What are our options?**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 10):** IMPOSSIBLE! Off the board. \ud83d\udea8 HARD NO!\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 8):** SAFE! Opens up the interior of the board.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 9):** CRASH! Into our body/tail. INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 WE AIN'T FOOLS!\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** SAFE! Continues our march across the top boundary.\n\n**Result of Step 2 (Elimination):** We have two safe moves: **DOWN** to (2, 8) or **RIGHT** to (3, 9).\n\n**Strategy Consideration: The Box Starts Now!**\n\nOur goal is not just to survive, but to box this guy in. By controlling the boundary (Row 9 and potentially Column 0), we drastically reduce his movement options later when we start dropping down to the center.\n\n*   **Option 1: RIGHT to (3, 9):** This is the logical next step. It continues our aggressive territorial claim. It keeps us in the safest, most open part of the board, far away from the enemy and potential head clashes. This is a power move.\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (2, 8):** This is a retreat from the top edge. Why would we give up the advantage we just fought for? If we drop down now, we are wasting the strategic positioning of the last two turns. We need more board control before we dive.\n\n**What is the Enemy likely doing? (Snake 0 at (9, 6))**\nHe is still on the right wall. He will likely move DOWN again to (9, 5) or maybe grab the apple at (8, 6) by moving LEFT to (8, 6).\n*   If he moves DOWN to (9, 5), he continues the vertical consolidation.\n*   If he moves LEFT to (8, 6), he's making his first play for the interior.\n\nIn either case, our move RIGHT keeps maximum distance. We should finish claiming the top edge first.\n\n**Decision:** We are going RIGHT. We want to secure the entire top edge (Row 9) up to at least (8, 9) before we start dropping down and pushing the enemy towards the bottom or the center. This is called establishing a perimeter, chat! We need space to grow safely and then *pressure* him.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\nContinue moving along Row 9 until we reach (8, 9). Then, we will drop DOWN to (8, 8) or (7, 9) and start building a wall down the middle-right side of the board to separate him from the open center/left (which we currently occupy). Once we have a length of 5 or 6, we'll be ready to force some close encounters. Our safety is paramount, but our territory is next!\n\nRIGHT",

We got one apple, he's got two, but let's look at the board dominance!\n\n### Turn 4 Analysis: Securing the Top Shelf\n\n**Current State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1, Length 2):** Head is locked at **(3, 9)**. Body is [(2, 9)]. We are OWN-ING Row 9!\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0, Length 3):** Head is at **(8, 6)**. Body is [(9, 6), (9, 7)]. Wait, he got longer! He ate an apple! He's growing while we're stuck patrolling the border! That apple at (8, 6) must have been tasty. He moved from (9, 6) to (8, 6) and grew. That means he has **three** segments now. We gotta catch up!\n\n**Our Head is at (3, 9). What are our options?**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 10):** IMPOSSIBLE! Off the board. \ud83d\udea8 HARD NO!\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** SAFE! Starts moving us into the interior.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 9):** CRASH! Into our body. INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 WE'RE NOT THROWING!\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** SAFE! Continues our march across the top boundary.\n\n**Result of Step 2 (Elimination):** Two safe moves: **DOWN** to (3, 8) or **RIGHT** to (4, 9).\n\n**Strategy Consideration: The Race for Position!**\n\nThe enemy (Snake 0) is now at (8, 6) and is longer than us (3 segments vs. our 2). He is well-positioned to dive into the center or continue down the right wall. We need to maintain our control and find an apple ASAP!\n\n*   **Option 1: RIGHT to (4, 9):** This continues our primary objective: securing Row 9. We need to force him to react to us! Moving to (4, 9) extends our massive wall. This is a very safe move, keeping us far from any potential clutter. If we move RIGHT, we are still on the high ground, literally.\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (3, 8):** This drops us down toward the center. This is a good move to start approaching the apples at (4, 4), (4, 3), and maybe (3, 0). However, it immediately exposes our tail at (2, 9) and forces us to make decisions in the crowded center sooner than we might like, especially being shorter than the opponent.\n\n**Refining the Plan:**\nOur goal was to secure Row 9 up to (8, 9). We are currently at (3, 9). Staying on the border (moving RIGHT) remains the safest path to guaranteed growth and territory acquisition. If we can get to (6, 9) or (7, 9) safely, and *then* cut down, we build a much stronger funnel.\n\nLet's look for apples. There are no immediate apples in Row 9. The closest immediate, reachable targets are (3, 0) and (4, 1) and (4, 3). If we move DOWN to (3, 8), we are setting up a path towards those, but it feels too early to abandon the wall.\n\n**What is the Enemy likely doing? (Snake 0 at (8, 6))**\nHe just ate an apple! Good move by him.\nHe has a clear path:\n1.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** Continue down the wall.\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** Move towards the center/top apples like (5, 6).\n3.  **UP to (8, 7):** Risky, but possible.\n\nSince we are still far away, the safest and most strategic move is to finish our perimeter. We need to be long enough to *hold* the territory we claim, and by remaining on Row 9, we are maximizing our survival chances while building length. We are only 2 long\u2014we need to be 3 or 4 before we start getting spicy!\n\nWe commit to the flanking maneuver. We keep going RIGHT. Let's finish this wall!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\nContinue moving RIGHT until we reach (7, 9) or (8, 9). Then, drop DOWN, aiming to create a vertical wall around column 7 or 8, separating the opponent's starting corner from the main playing field, and then hunt the apples in the center lanes (y=4 to y=6).\n\nRIGHT",

The scoreboard is 2 to 1 in his favor, but we are about to make a MAJOR power play! \ud83d\ude08\n\nWe are currently the shorter snake (2 segments vs. his 3 segments), so survival and growth are paramount. But we need to switch from defense to offense!\n\n### Turn 5 Analysis: The Drop!\n\n**Current State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1, Length 2):** Head is at **(4, 9)**. Body is [(3, 9)]. We just finished establishing column 9 dominance up to X=4. Time to pivot!\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0, Length 3):** Head is at **(7, 6)**. Body is [(8, 6), (9, 6)]. He is hanging out in the mid-right quadrant and has a clear path to the center and down the right wall.\n\n**My Head is at (4, 9). What are our options, chat?**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 10):** IMPOSSIBLE! Off the board. \ud83d\udc80 Get out of here!\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 8):** SAFE! This is the pivot! We finally cut into the center.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 9):** CRASH! Into our body. INSTANT DEATH! \u274c We are NOT throwing this lead!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):** SAFE! Continues along the border.\n\n**Result of Step 2 (Elimination):** Two safe moves: **DOWN** to (4, 8) or **RIGHT** to (5, 9).\n\n**Strategy Consideration: The Aggressive Containment!**\n\nWe have completed the most crucial, defensive phase of our strategy which was securing the top wall. Continuing RIGHT to (5, 9) is safe, but it delays our objective of finding apples and entering the main combat zone.\n\nApples are calling our name, notably the juicy one at **(5, 6)** and the one we can use to start building a path to the bottom at **(4, 4)** or **(4, 3)**.\n\n*   **Option 1: RIGHT to (5, 9):** Still safe, still defensive. But we are wasting time and distance. We are not getting closer to the action, and the opponent is getting longer. We need to start building our internal wall.\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (4, 8):** This is the move! This sets us up perfectly to start moving vertically and claiming the center lanes (X=4 and X=5). This is the drop-in maneuver.\n\n**What is the Enemy likely doing? (Snake 0 at (7, 6))**\nHe is long and in control of the right wall. He has options:\n1.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** Targets the apple at **(5, 6)**. This is extremely likely! If he goes here, he gets an apple and is now length 4.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** Starts moving down the column, probably aiming for (7, 4) or an apple at (6, 2).\n3.  **UP to (7, 7):** Less likely, as it moves away from objectives.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 6):** CRASH into his body at (8, 6). Impossible.\n\nFocusing on the most aggressive prediction: He will go LEFT to **(6, 6)** to eat the apple at (5, 6).\n\nIf he moves LEFT, he is now at (6, 6) and turns into length 4. We would be at (4, 8). We are still safe, and we have established a strong positioning in Column 4. Next turn, we could move DOWN again to (4, 7), then (4, 6) to start blocking his horizontal movement, or move RIGHT to (5, 8) to secure even more center territory.\n\nThe move DOWN sets up a confrontation later, while maximizing our survival chances now. It also brings us closer to apples like (4, 4), which is right below us. It's time to become the internal aggressor!\n\nLet's go DOWN! We are dropping into the center to dominate! CHAT! Are you ready for this action?!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n1.  **Turn 5 (This turn):** Move DOWN to (4, 8). Establish Column 4 dominance.\n2.  **Turns 6/7:** Continue moving DOWN Column 4 (to (4, 7), (4, 6)). This cuts off the enemy's access to the left side of the map, forces them to continue down the right side, and clears the path for us to grab the central apples like (4, 4) & (4, 3).\n3.  **Containment:** Get below his head and use our body to create a vertical wall down the center of the board, restricting him to columns 7, 8, and 9.\n\nDOWN",

The score is 2 to 1 in favor of Snake #0, but we are about to start asserting BOARD DOMINATION! \ud83d\ude08\n\n### Turn 6 Analysis: The Internal Wall is Built!\n\n**Current State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1, Length 2):** Head is at **(4, 8)**. Body is [(4, 9)]. We are perfectly positioned in Column 4, looking to drop further.\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0, Length 4 - assumed):** Head is at **(6, 6)**. Body is [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6) - the tail at (9,6) only if there was an apple at (6,6) and the coordinates are correct]. Let's confirm the coordinates from the board state:\n    *   Snake #0 Head: (6, 6), Body: [(7, 6), (8, 6)]. **Length is 3.** Okay, he did *not* eat an apple last turn if his body is only length 3.\n    *   Wait, let's look at the board: `6 . . . . A A 0 T T .` The opponent (0) is at (6, 6). His body segments (T) are at (7, 6) and (8, 6). The board state shows the **end** of his body is near (8, 6), so his body must be (7, 6), (8, 6).\n    *   Let's check the opponent list again: Opponent #0 - Head: (6, 6), Body: [(7, 6), (8, 6)]. **Length 3 confirmed.** He must have moved LEFT from (7, 6) to (6, 6). He did *not* eat the apple at (5, 6) yet (it's still visible).\n\nThis is a MAJOR relief, chat! He is shorter than we thought! This means the apple at **(5, 6)** is still up for grabs, and he is now cornered between apples!\n\n**My Head is at (4, 8). What are our options?**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):** CRASH! Into our body. INSTANT DEATH! \u274c Did you see that move, chat? Almost missed a self-collision!\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** SAFE! Continues our vertical domination of Aisle 4.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** SAFE! Opens up the left flank.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** SAFE! Positions us perfectly to challenge for the center, specifically for the apple at **(5, 6)**.\n\n**Strategy Consideration: The Race for (5, 6)!**\n\nThe apple at (5, 6) is the most valuable target right now because:\nA) It increases our score and length.\nB) It denies Snake #0 growth and cuts off his immediate escape route to the center-left.\n\n**Where is Snake #0 (at (6, 6)) going?**\nHe is almost certainly moving to (5, 6) to eat that apple. He's hungry!\n*   If he moves **LEFT to (5, 6)**, he eats and grows to length 4.\n\nIf he moves there, we need to decide if we want to risk a head-on collision or cut him off after he grows.\n\n### Potential Moves vs. Opponent's Likely Move (LEFT to (5, 6)):\n\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (4, 7):**\n    *   **Me:** (4, 7). Safe.\n    *   **Him:** (5, 6). He is now one cell away from us, making a confrontation likely next turn. He will be length 4. We will be safe at length 3. This maintains our safe path and keeps the pressure on.\n*   **Option 2: RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n    *   **Me:** (5, 8). Safe. We are getting very close to him.\n    *   **Him:** (5, 6). He eats. He is now directly below us, two cells away diagonally. We have positioned ourselves defensively in the corner, but not offensively towards the apple.\n\nIf we want the apple at (5, 6), we must move DOWN, then RIGHT, or RIGHT, then DOWN.\n\nLet's look at the distance.\nFrom (4, 8) to (5, 6) is two moves (Right, Down, Down or Down, Right, Down, etc.).\nFrom (6, 6) to (5, 6) is one move (Left).\n\nHe will get the apple this turn if he goes for it, which is extremely probable. We cannot outrace him for (5, 6).\n\n**New Objective: Cut Him Off!**\n\nSince he is likely to hit (5, 6) and grow, we need to anticipate his *next* move and seal him off. After (5, 6), he is trapped between the board edge (top, right) and us (left, top-left). His main escape route will be DOWN towards (5, 5) or (6, 5), or possibly back RIGHT to (6, 6).\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (4, 7)**, we continue to secure the boundary. Our path is:\nTurn 6: (4, 7)\nTurn 7: (4, 6) (Cutting off access to the left)\nTurn 8: (5, 6) (Maybe grab the tail/if the apple is at (4,6) we grab that and grow)\n\nAlso, there is an apple at **(4, 6)** and **(4, 4)**! Moving down Column 4 gives us immediate access to two apples! **(4, 6)** is a free guaranteed apple in two turns if we stick to the plan.\n\n**Let's calculate the risk of moving RIGHT to (5, 8)?**\nThis move blocks his potential UP path, but he's already too low for that to matter. It commits us to X=5, which is OK, but we lose the efficiency of heading straight down for (4, 6).\n\n**Conclusion:** The safest and most efficient path for us to grow, assert board dominance, and set up a boxing match is to continue DOWN column 4. This guarantees us future apples ((4, 6) is only 2 moves away, safe from him) and isolates the opponent to the right-most columns.\n\nWe are dropping in, chat! We are the internal wall builder!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n1.  **Turn 6 (This turn):** Move DOWN to (4, 7). Secure the approach to the center apples. Opponent likely moves LEFT to (5, 6) and grows.\n2.  **Turn 7:** Move DOWN to (4, 6) to eat the apple. Grow to length 3. This completes the vertical wall down X=4, trapping the opponent to the right (X=5, X=6, X=7, X=8, X=9).\n3.  **Turn 8/9:** Pivot RIGHT to (5, 6) or DOWN to (4, 5) to control the remaining board and force the enemy into the corner. Since our score is lower, growth and safe cutting are key.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! Turn 7 is HERE! We are streaming LIVE, and the tension is palpable! That last move (DOWN to (4, 7)) was pure strategic genius! We avoided certain head-on combat while setting up our next apple score!\n\n### Turn 7 Analysis: The Enemy Has Reached the Apple!\n\nLet's look at the board state!\n\n**My Snake (ID 1, Length 3):**\n*   Head: **(4, 7)**\n*   Body: [(4, 8), (4, 9) - our old body segment at (4, 9) is now our tail at (4, 9) because we grew on Turn 6 by eating that phantom initial body segment.] Wait, no. My body was [(4, 8)] last turn. If I moved DOWN to (4, 7), my new body is [(4, 8), (4, 9)]. **Length 3 confirmed!** (The streamer note says \"Body: [(4, 8)]\" and \"Apples collected: 1\", so length is 2. I was at (4, 8), I moved DOWN to (4, 7). Body segments are at (4, 8) and (4, 9). **Length 3 confirmed!** Let's re-read the input: \"Body: [(4, 8)]\", \"Apples collected: 1\". This means my total length is 2 (Head + Body). If I moved, and didn't eat an apple, my length remains 2. Head (4, 7), Body (4, 8). *The board state provided in the input is for the beginning of Turn 7.* Let's stick to the provided state: Head (4, 7), Body [(4, 8)]. **Length 2 confirmed.** Okay, chat, the growth mechanics are tricky, but we are currently length 2.\n\n**Opponent Snake #0 (Length 4 - Likely):**\n*   Head: **(5, 6)** (He likely ate the apple at (5, 6) *last turn*).\n*   Body: [(6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6)]. **Length 4 confirmed** if he ate the apple at (5, 6), and he definitely did! His score is 3, so he's had prior growth. The crucial detail is that he is now at (5, 6) and is LENGTH 4, making him significantly longer than us.\n\n**Board visualization based on the new positions:**\nOur Head is at (4, 7). His Head is at (5, 6). We are one cell diagonally apart! **This is the MOMENT OF TRUTH!**\n\n### Step 1: Eliminate Deadly Moves\n\n**My Head: (4, 7). Body: [(4, 8)]**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 8):** CRASH! Into my own body! INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 6):** SAFE! We are moving directly onto an apple! (4, 6) is an apple! This is a guaranteed score and growth!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 7):** SAFE! Clear space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):** DANGER! We are moving adjacent to the enemy's head (5, 6).\n\n### Step 2: Opponent's Intentions (Snake #0 at (5, 6))\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 6), length 4. Where can he go?\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** COLLISION RISK! If we move RIGHT to (5, 7) and he moves UP to (5, 7), we both DIE! DOUBLE KO! Given our length disadvantage (2 vs 4), forcing a Draw/KO is not ideal unless guaranteed.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** SAFE! Moves him into open space, continues his descent.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** COLLISION RISK! If we move DOWN to (4, 6) to eat the apple, and he moves LEFT to (4, 6) to snag it, we both DIE! DOUBLE KO!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** CRASH! Into his own body segment at (6, 6)! INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**The Opponent's only safe offensive/expansion moves are DOWN to (5, 5) or LEFT to (4, 6) (to steal our apple/force KO).**\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Decision Time\n\nWe have a clear apple at **(4, 6)**. This is exactly where we were aiming!\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT to (5, 7).**\n*   **If he moves UP to (5, 7):** DOUBLE KO. Bad result for us, since he has a better score (3 vs 1).\n*   **If he moves DOWN to (5, 5):** We are safe at (5, 7). We are now positioned to drop onto (5, 6) next turn, but he has escaped our containment.\n*   **If he moves LEFT to (4, 6):** We are safe at (5, 7). He risks a KO with our move, but since we didn't move to (4, 6), he gets the apple, grows to 5, and we are now severely behind!\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (4, 6) (Eat the Apple).**\n*   **If he moves DOWN to (5, 5):** EZ CLAP! We eat the apple at (4, 6), grow to length 3. We maintain our vertical wall and dominate Column 4. He is now escaping into the lower center. FANTASTIC outcome!\n*   **If he moves LEFT to (4, 6):** HEAD-ON COLLISION! We both DIE! DOUBLE KO! Again, not ideal since he leads 3-1.\n\n**Wait, what if the board state hides his real move?**\nHe is leading 3-1. If he sees we are positioned at (4, 7), and an apple is at (4, 6), he KNOWS we are going for it, because it is our one clean, safe growth move.\n\nDoes he want to sacrifice his lead and risk a KO just to deny us score 2? Possibly. A tie is better than letting us catch up.\n\n**BUT CHAT, look at the potential! If he moves DOWN (5, 5), we get the apple and are only 2 apples behind.**\n\nIf we *yield* the apple and move LEFT to (3, 7):\n*   He moves LEFT to (4, 6) and gets the apple. Score 4-1. We are too far behind.\n*   He moves DOWN to (5, 5). Apple remains. We are now far from the action.\n\n**We MUST contest the apple at (4, 6). Losing ground now means we lose the game.**\n\nThe move DOWN to (4, 6) is the optimal path for board control and growth. We need to be aggressive. He is longer, but he is getting cornered into the bottom right quadrant.\n\n**Pondering the Opponent's Mindset:**\nSnake #0 is at (5, 6). He is trapped between X=5 and the right wall. The most rational move for him is to continue his path into open territory, which is **DOWN to (5, 5)**. Moving LEFT to (4, 6) forces a coin flip KO, which he doesn't need to risk when he's ahead and has plenty of open space below him.\n\n**The Risk Assessment:** We give the opponent a 50% chance to KO us by moving DOWN, but if we don't move DOWN, we 100% surrender board dominance and growth opportunities.\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY IS THE ONLY PLAY!** We go for the apple! We trust that his calculated move is for expansion, not mutual destruction.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note: Boxing Him In\nTurn 7: Move DOWN to (4, 6), eat the apple, grow to length 3. Opponent hopefully moves DOWN to (5, 5).\nTurn 8: Move DOWN to (4, 5). Continue securing Column 4 as a wall. We force him to stay X >= 5.\nTurn 9: Start pivoting RIGHT, possibly to (5, 5) if he moved down, or (5, 6) if the tail is clear, to start harassing his body or forcing him further right/down. We need to grow big enough (length 5+) to effectively trap him.\n\nWe are going for guaranteed growth and board dominance! LETS GO CHAT!\n\nDOWN",
