In subsequent moves (after our tail shifts), we can continue:\n\u2003\u2022 From (8,5), head DOWN to (8,4) (note that row4 is free at (8,4)).\n\u2003\u2022 Then from (8,4), we can continue heading downward to (8,3) and then start moving left gradually: (7,3) \u2192 (6,3) until we reach (5,3) and eat the apple.\n\nThis path avoids the enemy snake\u2019s cluster (which occupies cells around (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), and (6,6)) and steers clear of our own body.

Free.  \n\u2022 DOWN to (6,5)? Free.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN will eventually get us to the apple at (5,4) in three moves, but DOWN is the most direct next step toward that apple via (6,5)\u2192(6,4)\u2192(5,4). So I\u2019ll go DOWN.\n\nNext-turn strategy: continue down into (6,4), grab the apple at (5,4), then reassess whether to swing right to (9,4) or head north toward the cluster at (1,9)/(2,9).\n\nNext move: DOWN"

However, we need to ensure our next step is safe.\n\nFrom our head at (5,1), consider our options:\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb UP: Moving to (5,2). Although (5,2) is currently occupied by our tail, if we make a move that does not immediately eat an apple, the snake\u2019s tail will be removed (as per standard snake movement rules). Thus, moving UP to (5,2) is actually safe.\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb DOWN: Would take us to (5,0), which is occupied by our body.\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb LEFT: Would take us to (4,1), which is currently empty. However, it doesn\u2019t set us on an efficient path toward our target apple.\n\u2003\u2003\u25cb RIGHT: Would take us to (6,1), which is safe but again less direct.\n\nSince heading UP toward (5,4) provides a clear and direct path\u2014and the temporary occupancy at (5,2) is not a concern because that segment will be removed as we advance\u2014it is our best choice.\n\nA quick look around confirms that no enemy snake segments threaten the upward movement (the enemy snake is farther up around (6,6) and higher).\n\nThus, our next move is: UP."
