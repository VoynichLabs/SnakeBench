Alternatively, there's an apple at (3,5), which is 1 step right, 3 steps up.\n\nOur last move was RIGHT, bringing us to (3,2).

The enemy snake at (1,3) is some distance away, so no immediate threat from that side. The boundary walls are at coordinate limits 0 and 9, so moving down from (3,2) to (3,1) is safe.\n\nGoing up towards (3,3), (3,4), or further might delay our goal of reaching the nearby apple at (4,1), but could be beneficial if other apples are closer or if obstacle avoidance is better.\n\nOverall, given the immediate goal of eating the apple at (4,1), moving DOWN seems straightforward.\n\nPotential directions:\n\n- Moving UP: (3,3) — perhaps unnecessary, as it directs us away from the closest apple.\n- Moving LEFT: (2,2) — back to our previous position, not favorable.\n- Moving RIGHT: (4,2) — slightly closer horizontally, but possibly risking a collision if subsequent moves are not planned carefully.\n- Moving DOWN: (3,1) — directly closer to the apple at (4,1).\n\nGiven the above, I will choose to move DOWN to reach the apple efficiently, unless there are hidden dangers.

For simplicity, assume the snake length is 1 or 2 with the tail at (5,0).\n\n- No immediate danger is present at (5,1), which is free space.\n\n- The nearest apple at (7,1) is two steps to the right, so moving RIGHT next could get us there efficiently after moving up.\n\n- The apple at (4,9) is far away, so focusing on the closer apple at (7,1) is better now.\n\n- We should avoid moving into walls or ourselves; moving DOWN would go to (5,0), which is safe if our tail isn't there anymore, but considering we just moved UP, moving DOWN would bring us back to (5,0).
