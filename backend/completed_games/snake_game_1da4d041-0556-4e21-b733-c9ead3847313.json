After securing or expanding immediate apples, proceed **UP** (to (8,7) and safely away from walls and potential enemy traps, ensuring potential links for future apples with minimal risk, and potentially moving towards (4,9).\n\n### Decision for Next Move:\nTo gain points and secure safety, the analysis assists the decision to move **LEFT** in the immediate term and toward (6,4) directly. To subsequently verify safety and potential growth, observe the future move toward **UP** to continue efficient strategies toward fruit acquisition with minimal risk.\n\n---",

This would increase potential points and possibly provide free space for immediate consumption.\n2. **LEFT (6, 6):** This move brings proximity closer to the apple at (6, 4), but poses potential risk of later horizontal alignment with snake #1, which is located at (1, 4).\n3. **RIGHT (6, 8):** Aligns the snake's head further away from most apple positions; risky for potential point loss without immediate gain.\n4. **DOWN (6, 6):** Moving down would likely lead away from apple targets, slowing growth potential.\n\n### Decision for Next Move:\nMoving **LEFT** to (6, 6) aligns the snake closer to potential apples at (6, 4) and (4, 4), while having consideration for positioning safety concern. After picking an apple at (6, 4), I should then move **UP** from (6, 4) to maintain height safety away from walls and the enemy snake.\n\n### Planning:\n- **Move LEFT to (6, 6),** approaching (6, 4) for points.\n- After consumption, assessing the safe onward path (UP to (8, 6)) would be ideal in securing proximity to the second apple and maintaining a safe pathway from walls.\n\nThus, I decide to make a **LEFT** move next. After this move, I'll plan to move **UP** to secure point gain and maintain safety from walls or enemy snakes.\n\n--- \n\n**CHOOSE MOVE LEFT** to (6, 6) to align with the apple and begin approach from this position, ensuring more point acquisition in future strategy. My subsequent move toward (8, 6) should facilitate this point increase further, maintaining upward pathways away from wall or trap risk.",

However, it goes against our initial strategy of staying safe.\n* **Safety and Steady Movement:** Let's continue our steady rightward movement, avoiding the left edge. This keeps us safe from immediate danger from both the left and enemy snake.\n\n**Next Move:**\n\n**Right.** This will bring us further to the right, keeping us safe and potentially allowing us to reach a safer apple (like (6, 4)) without being directly in the enemy's path.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving right, I'll assess the new position and potential apples in the path. If the enemy snake is still on the right side, I'll reassess the need to move left or continue right to gain more time to reach a safer apple.\n\nUP",

Apples at (6, 4) are immediately below my head.\n   - **Enemy Snakes**: My head position (6, 4) does not immediately threaten any enemy snake. Enemy snake #1's head is at (1, 8) and body at (1, 7) and (2, 8).\n\n3. **Target Apple at (6, 4)**: \n   - Move SHOULD: DOWN allowing direct acquisition of the apple. This is safe since my body occupies (6, 5) and no other snake occupies (6, 4). The move will result in growth and point gain for my snake.\n\n***Strategy for North-East km.apple***:\n - Post apple consumption: My body at (6, 5) will move to (6, 4), allowing my snake to control my body positions on the board.\n - Utilize strategic consumption of accessible apples in future moves (like (4, 2) and (7, 2) beside (2, 3)), to avoid collisions and to score points.\n - Ensure safety avoiding potentially dangerous areas like along (1, 8) to (2, 8) where enemy snake bodies are present.\n\n### Next Move Decision\nWith the analysis above, when moving towards the apple at (6, 4), the best and safest direction to take:\n- **DOWN** towards (6, 4).\n\nSo my next move is **DOWN**. This direction is optimal for immediate point gain and safe positioning without collision.",
