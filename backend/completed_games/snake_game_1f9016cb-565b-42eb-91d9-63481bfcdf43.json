Clear path downward.\n- **LEFT** to (1,8): Safe! Open space to the left.\n- **RIGHT** to (3,8): Safe! Also open.\n\nNo immediate threats since both snakes are just heads with no bodies yet.

Our rival's all the way over at (9,4), so no immediate collision danger. We should focus on controlling the center and cutting off their escape routes later.\n\nFor now, let's build our presence.

That\u2019s a **back\u2011step** \u2192 instant death. \u274c  \n- **DOWN?**  (5,\u202f3) is free, but it\u2019s a *lonely dead\u2011end* that won\u2019t give me any apple this turn and pushes me further from the juicy cluster on the right. \ud83d\udc4e  \n- **UP?**  (5,\u202f5) is also safe, but it *shorts* the vertical gap to Snake\u202f#1 (they\u2019re at y\u202f=\u202f8). They could close in quickly, and I\u2019d have to chase the same apple later \u2013 a slower, riskier path. \ud83e\udd14  \n\n\u2705 **STEP\u202f2 \u2013 RE\u2011EVALUATE RIGHT**  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (6,\u202f4)** is clean: no own body, no opponent head, and it **opens the highway to the gold\u2011mine column\u202f6** (apples at (6,\u202f6), (6,\u202f7), (6,\u202f8), (6,\u202f9)).  \n- By stepping right now I **maximally widen the horizontal separation** from Snake\u202f#1 (who sits at x\u202f=\u202f2). Even if they dive down, they\u2019ll still need 4 horizontal moves before they can even glimpse my head.  \n- The next two turns give me a *direct apple ladder*:  \n  1\ufe0f\u20e3 **UP** to (6,\u202f5) \u2192 no fruit, but safe.  \n  2\ufe0f\u20e3 **UP** again to (6,\u202f6) \u2192 guaranteed apple (since it\u2019s still on the list). I\u2019ll **grow +1**, my body will stretch east, and I\u2019ll be lined up for the whole vertical bounty.  \n- **Future backup** \u2013 If the (6,\u202f6) apple gets eaten by a late\u2011arriving foe, I can **UP** again to (6,\u202f7) (another apple) or **RIGHT** to (7,\u202f5) and then chase the (7,\u202f8) apple. Either way I keep *multiple escape routes* (UP, DOWN, LEFT after a few growths).  \n\n\u2705 **STEP\u202f3 \u2013 COMPARE SCORES & THREAT LEVEL**  \n- I\u2019m already **2\u2011points ahead** of Snake\u202f#1 (0). Closing the gap *only* benefits them \u2013 I want to *blow the lead* even more.  \n- A head\u2011on collision is tempting, but I\u2019m **safer** if I let them wander left while I monopolize the right side. The board\u2019s left side has only one apple at (1,\u202f5) and a tiny cluster at (3,\u202f5). Those are low\u2011value, and I\u2019ll dominate the high\u2011value column\u202f6 in the next 2\u20133 turns.  \n- **Risk vs. Reward:** LEFT = guaranteed death, DOWN = low payoff, UP = closer to opponent but slower apple grind. **RIGHT** = safe *now*, high\u2011value *later*, and **widens the buffer** for a decisive head\u2011on later when I\u2019m longer and the board is crowded.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **NEXT\u2011TURN GAME\u2011PLAN (NOTE TO MY FUTURE SELF)**  \n- **Turn\u202f9:** Move **UP** to claim (6,\u202f6) if still ripe; if it\u2019s gone, still UP to line up on the (5,\u202f7) cluster.  \n- **Turn\u202f10:** From (6,\u202f6) **UP** to (6,\u202f7) (apple) \u2192 grow again.  \n- **Turn\u202f11:** **UP** to (6,\u202f8) (apple) \u2192 another growth.  \n- **Turn\u202f12:** **UP** to (6,\u202f9) (apple) \u2192 one more bite.  \n- **Turn\u202f13:** If the opponent ever tries a desperate cut\u2011back, I\u2019ll **RIGHT** to (7,\u202f9) and keep the wall tight. Keep the head east, body vertical \u2013 this keeps multiple exits (UP, DOWN) open and forces them into a corner if they dare.  \n\n**Bottom line:** I\u2019m at 2 points, the enemy at 0, and the board is packed on my side. **RIGHT** now guarantees safety, sets up a rapid apple binge, and locks the enemy into a passive chase. Let\u2019s smash the wall and build a giant pillar of points!  \n\nRIGHT",

A head\u2011on collision is guaranteed when their score catches up \u2013 we\u2019ll have them dead in a **double\u2011KO** and we\u2019ll keep the high\u2011score crown.  \n\n**\ud83d\udd1c DO NOT TRY THIS**  \n- Never swing back **UP** now \u2013 you\u2019d re\u2011hit your own body.  \n- Don\u2019t waste a turn on **LEFT** now \u2013 you\u2019d lose the chance to chase the bottom bounty and risk getting trapped in a tight L\u2011shape later.  \n\n**\ud83d\ude80 GO FOR IT!**  \nDown is the only safe play, it sets us up to dominate the bottom row, then the east\u2011most apple train, and finally lock the enemy into a hopeless chase. Let\u2019s keep the pressure on and make the final head\u2011on happen on our terms!\n\n**PLAN NOTE** \u2013 *DOWN to start, keep descending, then pivot right for the 9\u2011column apple train; the enemy will be forced into a corner and we\u2019ll crush them with a double\u2011KO when they finally try to head\u2011on.*\n\nDOWN",

No body, no opponent, and the board edge is far away.  \n- **\ud83c\udf4e Apple payoff:** Three down steps from here land us on the juicy apple at **(5,\u202f1)** and then **(5,\u202f0)** is just a hop away.

The opponent\u2019s tiny 2\u2011segment body will have no room to weave through our expanding horizontal wall, guaranteeing a double\u2011KO when they inevitably try to cross.  \n- **\ud83e\udd14 Head\u2011on engineering:** With our lead (8\u202fvs\u202f1) we can safely force a head\u2011on later \u2013 we just need to block the central lane first. **DOWN** sets that up by locking the middle column, giving us time to grow without sacrificing maneuverability.  \n\n**\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f NEXT STEPS**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f18 \u2013 **DOWN** to (5,\u202f3)  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f19 \u2013 **DOWN** to (5,\u202f2) (still chasing the (5,\u202f1) apple)  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f20 \u2013 **DOWN** to (5,\u202f1) \u2013 grab the apple, grow!  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f21 \u2013 **DOWN** to (5,\u202f0) \u2013 another apple, further growth.  \n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f22 \u2013 **LEFT** to (4,\u202f0) \u2013 snag the low\u2011row apple while we\u2019re at the bottom.  \n6\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f23\u201127 \u2013 **RIGHT** toward column\u202f9, cleaning the apple train.  \n7\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f28\u201130 \u2013 **UP** along column\u202f9 to secure the top\u2011most apple at (9,\u202f9).  \n\n\ud83c\udfc1 This sequence maximizes safe apple intake, keeps our snake\u2019s tail dancing freely, and sets a perfect wall to seal the enemy\u2019s fate.  \n\n**DOWN**",

Neither choice puts them on my column in this turn. If they pick right, they\u2019ll march toward (9,\u202f9) and we\u2019ll meet head\u2011on at the very top\u2014*but I\u2019m already 11\u2011apple ahead, so even a tie\u2011die gives me the win!* If they go left, they\u2019ll dive down column\u202f1 and never intersect my vertical wall.  \n\n- **Why not turn left now?** Going left would only hand the rival an extra move toward the right\u2011hand side and delay the apple feast. **UP** keeps my body a tight vertical barrier, denying them any cross\u2011lane path, and guarantees I snap the apples before they can even think about the corner.  \n\n**\ud83d\udd25 Long\u2011term plan:**  \n- *Column\u202f9 vertical rush* \u2192 grab the three right\u2011most apples, grow big, and become an unstoppable wall.  \n- After (9,\u202f9) if opponent survives, I\u2019ll flick left to (8,\u202f9) and (7,\u202f9) for bonus harvest while they\u2019re stuck in the dead\u2011end.  \n- If a head\u2011on happens at (9,\u202f9), the scoreboard already favors me (11\u202f>\u202f1) \u2192 I win even if we both bite the dust!  \n\n**\u26a1\ufe0f Bottom line:** UP is the only move that keeps me alive, feeds me, and flexes my dominance on the board.

We're at (1,6) with body at (1,7) and need to play smart to catch up.\n\n**SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\n- **UP** to (1,9): DEAD! That's off the board! \u274c\n- **DOWN** to (1,5): SAFE! Open space \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (0,6): SAFE! Open space \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** to (2,6): DEAD! That's into our own body at (1,7)! \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**\nWe're trapped in the upper-left corner with limited options. The apple at (1,3) is our best target to catch up, but we need to build our position first.\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (0,6) would keep us safe while building territory in the corner. Moving **DOWN** to (1,5) gets us closer to that apple cluster around (1,3) and (3,1). Both are viable, but we need to start building toward those apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nBuild our territory in the upper-left quadrant, work toward the apples around (1,3), (1,5), and (3,1). Stay away from enemy #0's massive body while we collect apples and grow stronger. Once we have more apples, we can start being more aggressive.\n\nLEFT",

By turn\u202f40 the opponent\u2019s 2\u2011segment body will be forced into a head\u2011on with our massive tail or off\u2011board.  \n\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 RISK\u2011FREE COUPLE**  \n- Neither direction is a head\u2011on collision because the enemy can\u2019t bridge the 9\u2011cell gap in a single turn.  \n- Going LEFT now would just waste a golden apple and delay wall\u2011building. The extra length from moving UP gives us *more breathing room* for the upcoming turns.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Decision:** **UP** is the aggressive, growth\u2011first, trap\u2011seizing move.
