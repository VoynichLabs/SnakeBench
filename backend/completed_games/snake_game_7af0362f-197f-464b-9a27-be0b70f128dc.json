This means I should stay clear of column 0. My current position, (7, 8), allows for movement but I need to consider my options carefully.\n\n### Possible Moves from (7, 8)\n1. **UP (7, 9)**: Invalid move (out of bounds).\n2. **DOWN (7, 7)**: Valid move into an empty space.\n3. **LEFT (6, 8)**: Backtracking; I was at this position already.\n4. **RIGHT (8, 8)**: Valid move into an empty space.\n\n### Move Evaluation\n- **UP**: Invalid (out of bounds).\n- **DOWN (7, 7)**: Valid, moving into an empty space but does not head toward the nearest apple.\n- **LEFT (6, 8)**: Backtracking which does not help my strategy.\n- **RIGHT (8, 8)**: Valid move, keeping me on a path that could further position me to reach (8, 6) in subsequent moves.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\nBy moving RIGHT to (8, 8), I would set myself up for the next turn to move DOWN to (8, 7) or directly to (9, 8), which could put me in a prime position to reach the apple at (8, 6) immediately after. Additionally, I would be maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake, as it's located far away in the opposite direction.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, my best option to maximize my progression toward an apple and remain safe from the enemy is to move RIGHT to (8, 8).\n\nDecided next move: **RIGHT**",
