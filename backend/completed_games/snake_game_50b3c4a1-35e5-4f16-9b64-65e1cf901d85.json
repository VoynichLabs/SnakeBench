There are 5 apples at (4, 0), (9, 5), (6, 3), (4, 2), and (1, 5). To maximize points, I should aim to eat as many apples as possible.\n\nCurrently, the closest apples are at (4, 0) and (4, 2). However, moving to (4, 0) would require going through the wall, which is not allowed. So, I'll focus on (4, 2).\n\nTo reach (4, 2), I can move down to (8, 2) and then right to (9, 2), and finally down to (9, 1) to get closer to the apple.\n\nHowever, there's another snake (#1) at (5, 2). To avoid colliding with it, I should move around it. One possible strategy is to move left to (8, 0) and then down to (8, 1), which would put me in a position to move right to (9, 1) and then down to (9, 2) to get closer to the apple.\n\nSo, my strategy for the next turn is to avoid the other snake and move towards the apple.
