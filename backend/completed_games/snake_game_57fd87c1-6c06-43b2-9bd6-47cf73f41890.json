The next apple is at (1, 9), which is directly above us. Since our head is currently at (1, 2), moving UP would bring us to (0, 2), which is out of bounds and would result in our snake dying.\n\n2. **Enemy Snake**: The enemy snake is far away at (9, 2), so it doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\n3. **Future Strategy**: To maximize our points, we should try to eat the apple at (1, 9) as soon as possible. Moving UP would take us out of bounds and result in instant death. Moving DOWN does not lead us directly to an apple but moves us closer to the next potential apple path.\n\nGiven this, the best move is to move DOWN to (2, 2) and then plan to move UP to (1, 2) in the next move, eventually leading to the apple at (1, 9).\n\n**Decided next move:** DOWN",
