The new body is now updated to [(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,8)] initially, as the snake just grows without shrinking tail this turn. (Next turn the tail movement resumes normally).\n- But careful: usually in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail does NOT move this turn\u2014meaning body segments lengthen by one. Thus our exact new body after eating at (2,8) is likely [(3,8), (4,8), (5,8)] plus we keep our original tail at same spot because last turn we grew. Correctly modeling this behavior clearly gives us:\n\nNow current snake position accurately:\n- Head: (2,8)\n- Body: [(3,8), (4,8), (5,8)], plus we just grew. That means tail has not yet moved from (5,8) this turn, giving an effective snake now at: Head (2,8), Body [(3,8),(4,8),(5,8)] (with length now 4 total segments: head +3 body segments).\n\nRechecking apples updated position after previous apple consumption (now removed (2,8)):\n- Apples left: (8,5), (6,2), (3,9), (3,2), (9,2)\n\nEnemy Snake #2 current state (previously given clearly):\n- Head at (5,4), body [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nBoard analysis after our LEFT move:\n- Our snake has safely eaten at (2,8).\n- Important immediate surroundings:\n  - LEFT at (1,8): Currently open and safe.\n  - UP at (2,9): Open and safe.\n  - DOWN at (2,7): Open and safe.\n  - RIGHT at (3,8): Occupied immediately by our own body, thus lethal\u2014cannot move RIGHT.\n\nNow we should consider our short-term goals:\n- The closest apple next is at position (3,9), just slightly above and to the right. Let's see if we can get there easily:\n    - To reach apple at (3,9), the simplest and quickest route would be UP to (2,9), then RIGHT to (3,9). Both moves currently completely safe for now.\n- Enemy snake #2 is down at (5,4), several squares away. Currently poses no immediate threat to our immediate next apple.\n\nStrategy thus far:\nClearly the next apple at (3,9) is safe, easy, and clearly advantageous to pursue immediately.\n\nNext move decision for this turn:\n- Let's begin immediately heading toward that apple at (3,9), thus:\n  - Move UP now to (2,9) is safe, open, and positions us perfectly to grab the apple at (3,9) next turn.\n\nTherefore, straightforward decision rationalized clearly step-by-step:\n\nFinal Decision: UP"

Our snake is currently safe, no immediate threat.\n- Apples are at: (8,5), (6,2), (3,2), (3,9), (9,2)\n- The closest apple is at (3,9). It is exactly one space to our right at (3,9). Moving RIGHT would directly lead to consuming this apple easily.\n- Enemy snake #2 remains safely distant at (4,4), no immediate risk.\n\nImmediate safety check for the move RIGHT to (3,9):\n- (3,9) is occupied by an apple, thus safe and beneficial.\n- No walls or snake bodies obstruct this cell.\n\nThus a simple immediate advantage:\n- Move RIGHT directly lands us safely onto an apple, giving us an immediate growth and one point.\n\nFuture considerations:\n- After acquiring apple at (3,9), we'll continue carefully, possibly working our way towards other apples such as (8,5) and the cluster at row 2 later. But that's for a future turn.\n\nDecision clearly justified:\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT"
