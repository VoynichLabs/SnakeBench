Apples are scattered.\n2.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   **UP (1, 8):** Valid (on board, no body). Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 6):** Valid (on board, no body). Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 7):** Valid (on board, no body). Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 7):** Valid (on board, no body). Safe.\n3.  **Aggression & Positioning:** I need to cut off the board. The enemy is at (8, 0). If I stay low, I risk getting trapped in the bottom-left corner. I need to claim space. Moving UP to (1, 8) positions me near the top apples ((1,9) is an apple!) and keeps me central. It also allows me to move right or down later.\n4.  **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy is at (8, 0). They likely won't rush me immediately. They are far. I have room to maneuver.\n5.  **Long-Term Plan:** Move UP to get closer to the cluster of apples at the top right ((8,8), (2,8), (1,9)). I want to control the top half of the board to box the enemy in the bottom right. I will avoid moving left into the wall unless necessary.\n\nLET'S GOOO! I'm taking the high ground.\n\nUP",

Looking at the board state:\n    *   (1, 8) is my tail (T).\n    *   (2, 8) is an apple (A).\n    *   (0, 8) is empty (dot).\n    *   (1, 7) is empty (dot).\n2.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   **UP (1, 10):** Invalid (off board). Dead.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 8):** Valid? (1, 8) is currently my tail. But remember: moves are simultaneous. My tail will move away (to (1, 7) if I don't eat, or stays if I eat? Wait, I didn't eat an apple this turn. My tail moves forward. So (1, 8) becomes empty. So DOWN is safe *assuming* my tail moves. But if I eat an apple, my tail stays. I'm not eating an apple this turn unless I move onto one. So DOWN is safe.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 9):** Valid (on board, empty).\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 9):** Valid (on board, empty).\n3.  **Aggression & Positioning:**\n    *   I want to get to the apples on the left side: (0,5), (2,1), (4,0), etc. But (2, 8) is RIGHT next to me. That's a free apple.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (2, 9), I'm setting up to grab (2, 8) or (3, 8) next. But (2, 9) is a bit exposed.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (1, 8), I'm stepping onto my current tail position. That's usually safe if the tail moves. But I want to move towards apples.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (0, 9), I head towards the left edge. (0, 5) is down there.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (1, 8), I'm essentially staying in the middle column.\n4.  **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #1 is at (8, 2). There's an apple at (9, 2) right next to them. They will likely go RIGHT to (9, 2) to eat. If they do, they grow. They are far away from me.\n5.  **Long-Term Plan:** I need to sweep the top row and then drop down the left side. (2, 8) is the closest apple. I can grab it next turn by moving RIGHT now to (2, 9), then DOWN to (2, 8). Or I can move DOWN to (1, 8) and then RIGHT to (2, 8). Moving RIGHT to (2, 9) feels more aggressive and claims space.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI'll go **RIGHT** to (2, 9). This positions me perfectly to eat the apple at (2, 8) next turn. It also keeps me away from the left edge for now, giving me more space to maneuver. The enemy is busy eating at (9, 2), so no threat there.\n\n**FANS, LET'S SECURE THE POSITION AND PREP FOR THE NEXT GROW!**\n\nRIGHT",

We're at turn 3 and we're looking SOLID! \ud83d\udcaa Let's break this down like we're analyzing a pro play!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **Board State:** My head is at (2, 9). Body is at (1, 9). That apple at (2, 8) is STILL there waiting for me!\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **UP (2, 10):** OFF BOARD! \ud83d\udc80 Dead on arrival. NOPE!\n    *   **DOWN (2, 8):** This is where I WANT to go! It's an apple. My body is at (1, 9) and (2, 9) - I'm not hitting myself. Is it clear of the enemy? Enemy is at (9, 2), far away. Safe!\n    *   **LEFT (1, 9):** This is my CURRENT tail position. But wait - my tail moves! If I don't eat an apple this turn, my tail will move to (2, 9) (where my head currently is). So moving LEFT back to (1, 9) would be safe? Actually, let's think about the timing. My head moves to (2, 9) in the last turn. My tail was at (1, 8). Now my head is at (2, 9) and body is at (1, 9). If I move LEFT back to (1, 9), that's where my body currently is. I'd be crashing into my own body! \u274c DEAD!\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 9):** Valid spot, empty. Safe.\n\n3.  **Aggression & Strategy:**\n    *   Moving **DOWN to (2, 8)** gives me an apple! That's +1 point and I grow. My score becomes 2, tying with the enemy (currently 2).\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (3, 9) doesn't give me anything. I lose the apple at (2, 8) to... well, nobody, it just stays there.\n    *   Moving LEFT is death.\n    *   Moving UP is death.\n\n4.  **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #1 is at (9, 2). There's an apple at (9, 2) - wait, that's where their head IS! Actually, looking at the board:\n    ```\n    2 . . . . . . . . T 1\n    ```\n    Their head is at (9, 2) and there's a T (tail) at (8, 2) and (8, 1). There's NO apple at (9, 2) in the list! The apple at (9, 0) is different. They might be chasing something else or blocking. Regardless, they're on the opposite side of the board. I have free reign up here.\n\n5.  **Long-Term Plan:** I need to dominate the top-left quadrant first. I'm currently at (2, 9) and (1, 9). I can sweep left across the top row (0,9), then drop down to (0,8), (0,7), etc. There's an apple at (0,5) I can grab on the way. By eating (2, 8) now, I secure growth and position myself to move to (2, 8) as my new head, then I can decide to go LEFT to (1, 8) or DOWN to (2, 7) next turn. The apple at (3, 8) is also nearby for future turns.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI'm going **DOWN** to (2, 8) to eat that apple! This is the smartest play - it's safe, it gives me points, and it positions me well. The enemy is too far to interfere.

My tail will catch up to (2, 8).\n            *   Safe moves from (3, 8) will likely be LEFT (back to 2,8), UP (3,9), DOWN (3,7).\n            *   This keeps me flexible near the top edge.\n\n4.  **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   Snake #1 is at (9, 1). There are apples at (9, 0) and (2, 1) and (8, 8).\n    *   They might chase (9, 0) or (8, 8).\n    *   They are currently very far from me. A head-on collision is impossible this turn regardless of my choice (unless I move straight down into the center and they move straight up, which is unlikely given their position). Even if they moved perfectly diagonally, they couldn't reach me.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   I need to take the lead. 3-2 is better than 2-2.\n    *   Eating the apple at (3, 8) is the safest aggressive play. It secures points and holds the top-right corner of my zone.\n    *   Moving UP is suicide.\n    *   Moving DOWN or LEFT gives up the apple for no immediate gain.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI'm snatching that apple at (3, 8)! Let's get ahead in the score and dominate the top lane.\n\nChat, we're going for the W!\n\nRIGHT",

This is usually a safe boundary to follow. From there, I can chase the apple at (8, 8) or (0, 5) depending on which way I turn next. This opens up the entire top row.\n        *   **DOWN (3, 7):** Moves me toward the center. This brings me closer to apples like (4, 4) and (5, 6), but also potentially closer to the enemy if he decides to climb up. I want to hold the top for now.\n        *   **RIGHT (4, 8):** Moves me horizontally. This is good for chasing (8, 8).\n    *   **Decision:** **UP to (3, 9)** is the play.\n        *   Why? It secures the top edge.\n        *   It gives me a \"wall\" behind me (my body from (2,8) to (1,9) is relatively contained).\n        *   From (3, 9), I have LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN options next turn (UP is out of bounds).\n        *   Moving UP keeps me away from the center conflict zone for now, allowing me to maneuver freely along the top edge.\n\n4.  **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   Enemy is at (8, 1). There is an apple at (8, 8) and (9, 0). He might go UP or LEFT.\n    *   He is still too far to threaten me this turn. I control the top, he can have the bottom for now.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the top edge. Lure the enemy into the center or force him to follow me along the top where I can trap him. Keep the score lead. Avoid head-on collisions until I'm significantly larger (maybe 5+ apples).\n\nChat, I'm taking the high ground! Let's go!\n\nUP",

Turn 7 and we're still on top! \ud83d\udcaa Let's break this down.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **Analyze Current State:**\n    *   **My Position:** Head at **(4, 9)**. Body at **[(3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 8)]**. Note: The board shows an 'A' at (4, 9) on the visual, but the text list says \"A\" is just a placeholder for apples. I need to check if my head is actually on an apple. Looking at the Apple Drops list: (9, 0), (4, 4)... wait, (4, 9) isn't in the apple list. However, the board grid at (4, 9) shows \"0\" (me). The board grid at (4, 8) is blank. Wait, looking closer at the board grid:\n        ```\n         9 . . . T 0 . . . . .\n        ```\n        Actually, looking at the apple list, there is NO apple at (4, 9). The apples are at specific coordinates. The board visual shows \"A\" for apples. At (4, 9) it shows \"0\". So no apple there.\n    *   **Score:** 3 vs 2. I'm winning.\n    *   **Enemy:** Head at (6, 1). Body at (7, 1), (8, 1). Still in the bottom right.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **UP to (4, 10):** Out of bounds. Dead. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 8):** Is this safe?\n        *   My body: (3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 8). (4, 8) is empty of my body.\n        *   Enemy body: Far away.\n        *   **SAFE.** \u2705\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 9):**\n        *   My body: (3, 9) is my first body segment. Moving left puts my head where my neck is. That's a crash. \u274c\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 9):**\n        *   My body: (3, 9), (3, 8)... (5, 9) is empty.\n        *   Enemy body: Far away.\n        *   **SAFE.** \u2705\n\n3.  **Strategy & Aggression:**\n    *   I have two safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n    *   **Moving RIGHT to (5, 9):** Keeps me on the top row. I'm moving away from the center. This feels passive. I want to dominate the board. The center is at (4, 4) and (6, 5). I'm at the top edge.\n    *   **Moving DOWN to (4, 8):** This moves me into the board. From (4, 8), I have options next turn: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT (UP would be back to (4, 9) which might be occupied by my tail if it hasn't moved yet, but generally moving into the open space is better). Moving DOWN opens up the center of the board.\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Enemy is at (6, 1). He's likely to move towards apples or expand. He's nowhere near me.\n    *   **Aggression:** To box him in, I need to control the center. Moving DOWN from (4, 9) to (4, 8) gets me closer to the center apple at (4, 4). It also keeps my path open. If I go RIGHT to (5, 9), I'm stuck on the rim. If I go DOWN to (4, 8), I can pivot Left/Right/Down next turn.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   DOWN is the move that expands my territory and moves towards the center. It gives me more mobility for the next turn.\n    *   Let's GOOO!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (4, 8), I can look to secure the center column. I need to watch the enemy. If he comes up the right side, I'll cut him off. Don't get trapped on the edge. Control the flow.\n\nDOWN",

Let's see the board.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **Current State:**\n    *   **My Head:** (4, 8)\n    *   **My Body:** [(4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)] (Wait, looking at the board: my head was at (4, 8). The body list in the prompt says [(4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]. Wait, the prompt says \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (4, 8), Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]\". Okay, so my tail is at (3, 8). The move last turn was DOWN from (4, 9) to (4, 8). Correct.\n    *   **Enemy:** Head at (6, 2). Body [(6, 1), (7, 1)]. He's still low.\n    *   **Score:** 3 vs 2. I'm winning.\n    *   **Apples:** We have many apples. (4, 4) is central. (6, 5) is nice.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **UP to (4, 9):** My body (4, 9) is there. CRASH. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 7):**\n        *   My body: (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8). (4, 7) is empty.\n        *   Enemy body: Far away.\n        *   **SAFE.** \u2705\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 8):**\n        *   My body: (3, 8) is my tail. Moving LEFT puts my head where my tail *currently* is. Since the tail will move away (assuming I don't grow), this is usually safe *unless* I'm growing. But wait, I'm moving into the cell my tail is currently occupying. In Snake rules, if the tail moves away simultaneously, it's safe. However, if I hit an apple, I grow and the tail stays, causing a crash. There is no apple at (3, 8). So it should be safe. BUT, checking the board visually: `8 . . . T 0 . . . A .` (Row 8). At index 3 is `T` (Tail). At index 4 is `0` (Head). So (3, 8) is indeed my tail. If I move LEFT, I go to (3, 8). The tail moves to (2, 8) (or wherever). So it's a valid move.\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n        *   My body: (4, 8), (4, 9)... (5, 8) is empty.\n        *   Enemy body: Far.\n        *   **SAFE.** \u2705\n\n3.  **Strategy & Aggression:**\n    *   Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    *   **Moving RIGHT to (5, 8):** This moves me towards the right side. There's an apple at (6, 5) nearby. However, the board has an apple at (4, 4) directly below me.\n    *   **Moving DOWN to (4, 7):** This is a strong move. It puts me directly above the apple at (4, 4). I can secure the center column. From (4, 7), I can reach (4, 4) in 3 moves.\n    *   **Moving LEFT to (3, 8):** This moves me away from the center. The apples are mostly to the right/down. (2, 1) is an apple, but that's far and low. (0, 5) is another, but again, moving left isn't aggressive towards the central apples.\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Enemy is at (6, 2). He likely wants the apple at (6, 5) or (5, 6). He's on the right side. If I move DOWN towards the center, I cut off the middle of the board. If I move RIGHT, I engage him more directly. If I move LEFT, I isolate myself.\n    *   **Dominance:** I need to control the center. The apple at (4, 4) is juicy and central. Moving DOWN puts me on the path to eat it and control the vertical column. This splits the board and forces the enemy to the sides.\n    *   **Risk:** If I go DOWN to (4, 7), I'm getting closer to the enemy's potential path, but he's far. It's safer than closing distance on the right side where he is currently.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   DOWN is the best option to control the board and secure the apple at (4, 4).\n    *   I'm winning. I play to control. I play to eat. I play to WIN.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the center column. Move down to (4, 7), then (4, 6), then eat (4, 4). This establishes dominance over the middle of the map. Watch the enemy on the right; if he pushes up, I'll be ready to box him in. Don't let him cross the center line.\n\nDOWN",

CRASH. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 6):**\n        *   My body: (4, 8), (4, 9)... (4, 6) is clear.\n        *   Enemy body: Far away (right side). (4, 6) is clear.\n        *   **SAFE.** \u2705\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 7):**\n        *   My body: (4, 8) etc. (3, 7) is empty.\n        *   Enemy body: Clear.\n        *   **SAFE.** \u2705\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 7):**\n        *   My body: Clear.\n        *   Enemy body: Clear.\n        *   **SAFE.** \u2705\n\n3.  **Strategy & Aggression:**\n    *   **The Apple at (4, 4):** My long-term plan was to secure the center column. From (4, 7), I need to go DOWN to (4, 6), then (4, 5), then I can eat the apple at (4, 4). That's 3 moves. I need to stay on this path to dominate the board.\n    *   **The Enemy:** He's at (5, 2). He's far away. He might be looking at apples at (5, 6) or (6, 5). If I go DOWN to (4, 6), I am setting up a potential confrontation in the center, but I have the vertical advantage.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **RIGHT to (5, 7):** Moves me towards the enemy's side of the board. While there is an apple at (6, 5) or (5, 6), moving right now brings me closer to the enemy's starting area without securing the central axis. It feels reactive.\n        *   **LEFT to (3, 7):** Moves me away from the juicy apples. The apples are mostly on the right side of the board (e.g., (6,5), (8,8), (5,6)). Going left isolates me.\n        *   **DOWN to (4, 6):** This is the power move. It keeps me on the central column. It positions me to eat the apple at (4, 4). It keeps my path open. I want to control the board, and the center is control.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   I need to eat. The fastest path to an apple is DOWN towards (4, 4).\n    *   I want to box the enemy in. By taking the center, I limit his movement options.\n    *   I am winning on board control. Let's stick to the plan.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the center! Move DOWN to (4, 6). Next turn, move DOWN to (4, 5). Then eat the apple at (4, 4). Once I have that, I'll pivot right to hunt the enemy or grab more apples on the right side. Don't let him cross the 5x line.\n\nDOWN",

We need to make a move that secures the apple at (4, 4) and keeps us dominant. Let's break this down!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (4, 5) [I successfully moved DOWN last turn, landing on the apple!]\n    *   **My Body:** [(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (5, 4) [Enemy moved UP from (5, 3)]\n    *   **Enemy Body:** [(5, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2)]\n    *   **Score:** I am now 4 apples to their 3! \ud83d\ude80 WE ARE LEADING!\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **UP to (4, 6):** That's my current body (the neck). CRASH. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 4):**\n        *   **Board Check:** There's an Apple at (4, 4)!\n        *   **My Body:** (4, 6) onwards. (4, 4) is clear.\n        *   **Enemy Body:** They are at x=5, y=3-2. (4, 4) is clear.\n        *   **Enemy Head Prediction:** They are at (5, 4). If they move LEFT, they hit (4, 4). If we both move into (4, 4), it's a head-on collision. Since I have the lead (4 vs 3), a double KO means I WIN.\n        *   **Status:** If they don't move left, I get the apple and grow. If they do move left, we tie? No, I have more apples, so I win. The risk is acceptable, but let's look at other moves first.\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 5):**\n        *   **Board Check:** Empty.\n        *   **My Body:** Clear.\n        *   **Enemy Body:** Clear.\n        *   **Status:** Safe. \u2705\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n        *   **Board Check:** Empty.\n        *   **My Body:** Clear.\n        *   **Enemy Body:** The enemy's head is at (5, 4). If I move RIGHT to (5, 5), and they move UP to (5, 5), we collide head-on. Since I'm winning (4 vs 3), that's a WIN for me.\n        *   **Status:** Safe. \u2705\n\n3.  **Strategy & Aggression:**\n    *   **The Goal:** I have the lead. I want to maintain it and eventually force a win.\n    *   **Option A (DOWN to 4,4):** This is the high-reward move. I get the apple and grow to 5. The enemy is at (5, 4). If they are aggressive and try to cut me off by moving LEFT to (4, 4), we collide. With my higher score, I win. If they play safe and don't move left, I get the apple uncontested.\n    *   **Option B (RIGHT to 5,5):** This is aggressive positioning. It puts me directly above the enemy. If they move UP, we collide and I win (4 > 3). It also cuts off their access to the right side of the board.\n    *   **Option C (LEFT to 3,5):** This is the safe retreat. It avoids the potential collision with the enemy, but it gives up the apple at (4, 4). The enemy would likely eat it next turn, tying us up 4-4 or taking the lead 4-4 (if they eat it now? No, they are at (5,4), they can't eat (4,4) this turn unless they move left. Wait, if I move LEFT, I open up the apple for them. I don't want that.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   DOWN gives me the apple. It forces the enemy to decide: challenge me and lose (because I'm winning), or let me grow.\n        *   RIGHT positions me aggressively but doesn't guarantee an apple immediately (though (5,6) is nearby).\n        *   LEFT plays defensive and gives up board control.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   I am leading 4-3. I want to extend that lead.\n    *   The apple at (4, 4) is ripe for the taking.\n    *   The enemy is at (5, 4). If they try to intercept me at (4, 4), they lose the game instantly because of my score advantage.\n    *   Therefore, moving DOWN is the optimal play. It either guarantees growth or guarantees a win via collision.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTake the apple at (4, 4) to go up 5-3. Once grown, I need to assess the board. The enemy is likely to retreat or try to flank. I will look to cut off their escape routes and funnel them into a collision or trap them against the wall. Don't let them breathe!\n\nDOWN",

Let's break down the board state!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (4, 4) [Ate the apple!]\n    *   **My Body:** [(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (6, 4) [Wait, the board shows 1 at (6, 4)? The text says (6,4) but the visual board shows 1 at (5,4)? Let me check the prompt again. \"Snake #1 - Head: (6, 4)\". Visual Board row 4: `. . . . 0 T 1 . . .`. Visual shows 1 at (6,4). Visual matches the text.]\n    *   **Enemy Body:** [(5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2)] [Visual board shows T at (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). Yes.]\n    *   **Score:** 4 vs 3. I'm winning.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **My potential moves from (4,4):**\n        *   **UP to (4, 5):** That's my current body! CRASH. \u274c\n        *   **DOWN to (4, 3):**\n            *   Board: (4, 3) is an Apple.\n            *   My Body: (4, 5) onwards. (4,3) is clear.\n            *   Enemy Body: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). (4,3) is clear (it's x=4, they are at x=5).\n            *   Enemy Head: (6,4). Distance to (4,3) is 2 squares (x) + 1 (y). He can't reach it this turn.\n            *   Status: SAFE. \u2705\n        *   **LEFT to (3, 4):**\n            *   Board: (3, 4) is empty.\n            *   My Body: Clear.\n            *   Enemy Body: Clear.\n            *   Enemy Head: (6,4). Distance 3. Can't reach.\n            *   Status: SAFE. \u2705\n        *   **RIGHT to (5, 4):**\n            *   Board: (5, 4) is Enemy Body (T). CRASH. \u274c\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT):**\n    *   **Option DOWN to (4,3):**\n        *   Pros: I eat an apple! I grow to 5. I extend my lead to 5-3.\n        *   Cons: I'm moving closer to the wall. My body is at (4,5) and above. (4,3) puts me at y=3. I'm creating a vertical line.\n        *   Enemy position: (6,4). He is to the right.\n    *   **Option LEFT to (3,4):**\n        *   Pros: Moves me away from my body (which is at y=5+). Opens up the left side of the board.\n        *   Cons: I don't get an apple immediately. The apple at (4,3) is still there.\n        *   Enemy position: He is at (6,4). If he moves Left, he goes to (5,4) (his body). If he moves Down, he goes to (6,3). If he moves Up, (6,5).\n\n4.  **Strategic Consideration:**\n    *   The enemy is at (6,4). My body occupies (4,5) to (4,8).\n    *   If I move DOWN to (4,3), I am safe from the enemy (he is at x=6).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (3,4), I am also safe.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** If I move DOWN to (4,3), I eat the apple. The enemy is at (6,4). He has no way to kill me this turn.\n    *   However, looking at the board: `(3, 0), (4, 0)` are apples. `(2, 1)` is an apple. `(0, 5)` is an apple.\n    *   My body is blocking my own path if I go DOWN. I am at (4,4). Down is (4,3). My body is at (4,5).\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am moving towards the wall at y=0. My tail is at (4,8). That's a long way up.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I open up access to `(3,0)` and `(2,1)` and `(0,5)`.\n    *   **Wait, let's look at the board again.**\n        *   Row 4: `. . . . 0 T 1 . . .`\n        *   Row 3: `. . . . A T . . . .`\n        *   The `T` at (5,3) is enemy body.\n    *   **Enemy Move Prediction:**\n        *   Enemy is at (6,4). Body at (5,4), (5,3), (5,2).\n        *   Can he move LEFT? (5,4) is his body. YES, he can move into his own body? No, head cannot move into body.\n        *   Wait, the rules say: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n        *   So Enemy cannot move LEFT to (5,4) because that is his body.\n        *   Can he move DOWN to (6,3)? (6,3) is empty.\n        *   Can he move UP to (6,5)? (6,5) is empty.\n        *   Can he move RIGHT to (7,4)? (7,4) is empty.\n    *   **My Move:**\n        *   If I go DOWN to (4,3) (Apple), I am safe.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (3,4), I am safe.\n    *   **Risk Assessment:**\n        *   If I go DOWN: I eat. I am at (4,3). My body is at (4,4), (4,5)...\n        *   If I go LEFT: I am at (3,4). My body is at (4,4)...\n    *   **Aggression:**\n        *   I have the lead. I want to eat.\n        *   Is (4,3) dangerous? My body is above it. The enemy is far.\n        *   Is there a threat of trapping? I'm on the left side of the board (x=4). The enemy is on the right (x=6).\n        *   Let's look at the apple at (4,3). It's there.\n        *   The apple at (3,0) is also attractive.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   DOWN: Eats apple, grows. Increases lead to 5-3. Moves closer to wall.\n        *   LEFT: Positional play. Keeps me away from the wall. Head is at (3,4). Body at (4,4).\n    *   **The \"Box In\" Strategy:**\n        *   The prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\"\n        *   Enemy is at (6,4).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (4,3), I am solidifying the left side.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (3,4), I am moving horizontally.\n    *   **Safety Check again:**\n        *   Moving DOWN to (4,3):\n            *   Enemy at (6,4).\n            *   My new body: (4,4), (4,5)...\n            *   Enemy cannot reach (4,3) this turn.\n        *   Moving LEFT to (3,4):\n            *   Enemy at (6,4).\n            *   Safe.\n    *   **The Apple Priority:**\n        *   I am winning 4-3. I want to extend.\n        *   (4,3) is an apple.\n        *   (3,0) is an apple.\n        *   Moving DOWN gets me (4,3).\n        *   Moving LEFT sets me up for (3,0) or (2,1).\n    *   **Is (4,3) safer?**\n        *   If I go LEFT to (3,4), I am next to my body at (4,4).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (4,3), I am moving away from my body (which is at (4,4) and above).\n        *   Actually, moving DOWN from (4,4) to (4,3) puts my head below my neck (4,4). That's valid.\n    *   **Let's consider the enemy.**\n        *   He is at (6,4).\n        *   He sees me at (4,4).\n        *   If I move DOWN, I am at (4,3).\n        *   He might move LEFT? No, blocked by his body.\n        *   He might move DOWN to (6,3).\n        *   He might move UP to (6,5).\n        *   He might move RIGHT to (7,4).\n    *   **Long Term:**\n        *   I am at (4,4). My tail is at (4,8).\n        *   If I go DOWN, I have a vertical line at x=4.\n        *   The apples at (3,0), (4,0) are below. (2,1) is below left.\n        *   If I go DOWN, I can access (4,0) easily.\n        *   If I go LEFT, I can access (3,0) and (2,1).\n    *   **The \"Box In\" Plan:**\n        *   Enemy is at x=6.\n        *   I am at x=4.\n        *   If I stay at x=4 or move to x=3, I am controlling the left side.\n        *   The wall is at x=0.\n        *   The enemy is at x=6. The wall is at x=9.\n        *   I am NOT boxing him in yet. He has plenty of space.\n        *   However, I need to secure apples.\n    *   **Comparison of SAFE moves:**\n        1.  DOWN (to 4,3): Eat apple. Grow. Score 5-3.\n        2.  LEFT (to 3,4): No apple. Score 4-3.\n    *   Eating is better. It extends the lead.\n    *   Is (4,3) dangerous?\n        *   My body is at (4,4), (4,5)...\n        *   Enemy is at (6,4).\n        *   I am safe this turn.\n        *   Next turn, I will be at (4,3) (if I move DOWN). My tail will move from (4,8) to (4,7).\n        *   The board is open.\n    *   **Wait, look at the board again.**\n        *   Row 3: `. . . . A T . . . .`\n        *   The `A` is at (4,3).\n        *   The `T` is at (5,3) (Enemy body).\n        *   My move DOWN to (4,3) puts me right next to the enemy's body at (5,3).\n        *   This is fine. Heads are not bodies.\n    *   **What if the enemy moves?**\n        *   Enemy at (6,4).\n        *   If he moves DOWN to (6,3), he is safe.\n        *   If he moves UP to (6,5), he is safe.\n        *   If he moves RIGHT to (7,4), he is safe.\n        *   He cannot move LEFT (blocked by his body at 5,4).\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   I have a clear path to an apple.\n        *   I am winning.\n        *   Extending the lead is the best way to secure victory.\n        *   Moving DOWN is the most direct way to grow.\n        *   Moving LEFT is safer in terms of space, but gives up the apple.\n        *   I should take the apple.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTake the apple at (4,3) to go up 5-3. Once grown, I need to assess the board. The enemy is likely to retreat or try to flank. I will look to cut off their escape routes and funnel them into a collision or trap them against the wall. Don't let them breathe! Next turn, I will look to head towards the cluster of apples at (3,0), (4,0), (2,1).\n\nDOWN",

Let's break down the board and secure this W!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (4, 3) - Just ate the apple!\n    *   **My Body:** [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)] - I'm a vertical line on x=4.\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (6, 5) - Moved UP from (6, 4).\n    *   **Enemy Body:** [(6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2)] - He's growing!\n    *   **Score:** 5 vs 4. I'm winning, but he's catching up.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **My potential moves from (4, 3):**\n        *   **UP to (4, 4):** My body is there! CRASH. \u274c\n        *   **DOWN to (4, 2):**\n            *   Board: (4, 2) is empty.\n            *   My Body: (4, 4) and above. Safe.\n            *   Enemy Body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). (4,2) is clear.\n            *   Enemy Head: (6, 5). Distance to (4,2) is huge. Safe. \u2705\n        *   **LEFT to (3, 3):**\n            *   Board: (3, 3) is empty.\n            *   My Body: Clear.\n            *   Enemy Body: Clear.\n            *   Status: SAFE. \u2705\n        *   **RIGHT to (5, 3):**\n            *   Board: (5, 3) is Enemy Body (T). CRASH. \u274c\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT):**\n    *   **Option DOWN to (4, 2):**\n        *   Pros: I am moving towards the wall and the apple cluster at the bottom (specifically (4,0) and (2,1)). It keeps my vertical structure.\n        *   Cons: I'm heading straight down into a corner (eventually).\n        *   Enemy position: He is at (6, 5). He is moving UP. We are moving away from each other vertically.\n    *   **Option LEFT to (3, 3):**\n        *   Pros: I move off the vertical line. This opens up the left side of the board. I am getting closer to (3, 0) and (2, 1). This is a better \"Box In\" position as I move towards the left wall, potentially cutting off the enemy's access to the left side if he ever wants to go there (though he's currently on the right).\n        *   Cons: I don't get an apple immediately.\n        *   Enemy position: He is at (6, 5). He is on the right side. Moving LEFT puts me in the center-left, maintaining distance.\n\n4.  **Strategic Consideration:**\n    *   **The \"Box In\" Strategy:** The enemy is on the right (x=6). I am on the left (x=4). If I move LEFT to (3,3), I am consolidating my control over the left half of the board. If I go DOWN to (4,2), I am just staying on the line.\n    *   **Future Apples:** The apples at (3,0), (4,0), and (2,1) are all on the bottom left. Moving LEFT to (3,3) puts me directly in the pipeline to grab (3,0) next. Moving DOWN to (4,2) is good for (4,0).\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy just moved UP. He is likely chasing the apple at (6, 7) or (5, 6). He is not a threat to me this turn.\n    *   **Scoring:** I am winning 5-4. I don't *need* to force an apple this exact second. I need to position myself to dominate the rest of the game. A position that opens up more options is better than a move that just goes straight down into a wall.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   LEFT is the superior strategic move. It moves me towards the unclaimed apple cluster at the bottom-left and keeps my options open.\n    *   DOWN is safe but restrictive.\n    *   I will take LEFT to maneuver into the best position to sweep the apples at the bottom of the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (3,3). From there, my next target is (3,0). Once I secure that, I'll clean up (4,0) and (2,1). While I'm doing that, the enemy is likely stuck on the right side or chasing scraps. I will use my body to cut off the center, forcing him into the right wall. Then, we close in for the kill! \ud83d\udc80\n\nLEFT",

CRASH. \u274c\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT):**\n    *   **Option UP to (3, 4):**\n        *   Pros: Opens up the top half of the board.\n        *   Cons: Enemy is at (7, 5), likely moving UP or LEFT. (3, 4) is getting closer to the enemy's horizontal range, but still safe for now. However, the apples are mostly at the bottom (3,0, 4,0, 2,1) and top-right (8,8). Moving UP moves me away from the immediate apple cluster.\n    *   **Option DOWN to (3, 2):**\n        *   Pros: Moves me closer to the apple at (2, 1) and (3, 0). This is the \"aggressive push\" towards the food on the left side.\n        *   Cons: I am heading towards the wall (y=0).\n        *   Enemy position: He is at y=5. Moving down is safe distance.\n    *   **Option LEFT to (2, 3):**\n        *   Pros: Moves me left towards the wall and the apple at (2, 1). It also positions me to potentially cut off the enemy if he decides to cross to the left side (unlikely given his position, but good positioning).\n        *   Cons: I lose vertical coverage.\n        *   Enemy position: He is at x=7. I am moving away from him.\n\n4.  **Strategic Consideration & Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   **Enemy Intent:** The enemy ate an apple at (6, 7) last turn. He is likely heading towards the apple at (5, 6) or (8, 8).\n    *   **My Goal:** I am tied 5-5. I need to eat. The closest apple is (2, 1).\n    *   **The \"Box In\" Strategy:** The enemy is on the far right (x=7). I am on the left (x=3). To box him in, I need to secure the left side and bottom. Moving DOWN or LEFT achieves this.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Moving DOWN to (3, 2) sets up a perfect path to (2, 1) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0). This is a dense apple cluster.\n        *   Moving LEFT to (2, 3) sets up (2, 1) but might be slightly less direct for (3, 0).\n    *   **Risk Assessment:**\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3, 2), the enemy (at 7,5) has no direct path to hit me. We are far apart.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (2, 3), same safety.\n        *   If I go UP to (3, 4), I'm moving toward the center, which is slightly riskier if the enemy moves left aggressively.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   LEFT is safe, but DOWN is better because it immediately progresses me towards the bottom-left apple cluster which is currently uncontested. The enemy is high up and right.\n    *   The apple at (2, 1) is reachable from (3, 2) (Left or Down-Left diagonal effectively next turn).\n    *   I will take **DOWN**. It keeps my path to the food open and maintains distance from the enemy on the right.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to (3, 2). Next turn, I will target the apple at (2, 1) or (3, 0). I'm going to sweep the bottom left corner, denying the enemy any access there. While he chases high apples, I'll secure the low ones and then turn my body into a wall to trap him against the right side!\n\nDOWN",

(4,2) is clear).\n            *   Enemy Body: Clear.\n            *   Status: SAFE. \u2705\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT):**\n    *   **Option DOWN to (3, 1):**\n        *   Pros: Moves me closer to the bottom wall and the apple cluster at (2,0), (3,0), (4,0). Sets up a sweep of the bottom edge.\n        *   Cons: *Does not get me the apple at (2,1).* I miss the immediate point opportunity.\n    *   **Option LEFT to (2, 2):**\n        *   Pros: Moves me *directly* into position to eat the apple at (2, 1) next turn (or even diagonal if rules allowed, but straight line is key). Secures the left side.\n        *   Cons: Slightly tighter space, but manageable.\n    *   **Option RIGHT to (4, 2):**\n        *   Pros: Moves me right, potentially cutting off the enemy if he tries to drop down later.\n        *   Cons: Moves me away from the immediate apple (2,1). I want to eat.\n\n4.  **Strategic Consideration & Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   **Enemy Intent:** He's at (7, 6). He likely wants the apple at (8, 8) or (6, 7) again. He is moving *UP/RIGHT*. He is NOT looking at my apples on the left.\n    *   **My Goal:** **SCORE.** I am losing. I need the apple at (2, 1).\n    *   **The \"Box In\" Strategy:** To box him in, I need to control the left and bottom. The apple at (2, 1) is critical territory.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **LEFT** gets me one step closer to (2, 1). From (2, 2), I can go DOWN to (2, 1) next turn and EAT.\n        *   **DOWN** or **RIGHT** delays the apple grab. The enemy might grab an apple before I do if I hesitate. I can't let him extend his lead.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   I need to be aggressive. I'm down by 1 point. The apple at (2, 1) is begging for me.\n    *   **LEFT** is the move. It positions me to secure that point immediately next turn while keeping my bottom-left flank secure. The enemy is too far right to threaten me here.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove **LEFT** to (2, 2). Next turn, I'm diving DOWN to (2, 1) to grab that apple and tie/take the lead. Once I eat, I'll sweep the bottom row (0, 1, 2) to grow big, then use my body to cut off the right side of the board, trapping the enemy against the wall. He's dead meat. \ud83d\udc80\n\nLEFT",

I see that apple at (2, 1) just waiting for me to eat it and tie the score. Let's break this down!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (2, 2)\n    *   **My Body:** [(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (7, 7)\n    *   **Enemy Body:** [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]\n    *   **Score:** 5 vs 6.

My body is clear. Enemy is clear. **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 2):** Board is empty. My body is clear. Enemy is clear. **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (3, 2):** This is my neck/body! I'd crash into myself. **DEADLY.**\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP to (2, 3):** Moves me up towards the center. It's safe, but it doesn't get me the apple at (2, 1). I lose momentum.\n    *   **DOWN to (2, 1):** **FREE FOOD!** This is the apple I've been eyeing. Eating it ties the score (6-6) and grows my body. Plus, (2, 1) is a solid position\u2014close to the bottom wall and other apples on the left side.\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 2):** Moves me left, away from the apple. I miss the point opportunity. Not ideal when I'm behind.\n\n4.  **Strategic Consideration & Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   **Enemy Intent:** Snake #1 is at (7, 7). Looking at the board, he's likely chasing the apple at (6, 7) or moving toward (8, 8). He is NOT looking at me. He is on the complete opposite side of the map.\n    *   **My Goal:** **SCORE.** I need to close the gap. The apple at (2, 1) is the closest food source and guarantees a point.\n    *   **The \"Box In\" Strategy:** To dominate the board, I need to control the left and bottom. Securing the apple at (2, 1) anchors my territory. From there, I can sweep the bottom row (0, 1, 2) and build a wall.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **DOWN** gets me the apple immediately. Ties the score. Grows my body. Secures the left flank.\n        *   **UP/LEFT** delay the grab. The enemy might grab an apple while I'm hesitating.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   I'm down by 1 point. The apple is literally right there at (2, 1).\n    *   **DOWN** is the move. I eat the apple, tie the score, and prepare to sweep the bottom row. The enemy is too far away to threaten me.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove **DOWN** to (2, 1) to eat the apple. Next turn, I'll likely move LEFT to (1, 1) or DOWN to (2, 0) depending on where the apples are. I'm going to sweep the bottom edge (x=0 to x=4) to grow big, then turn upward and use my massive body to cut off the right side of the board, trapping the enemy against the wall.

Let's break this down.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (2, 1)\n    *   **My Body:** [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)] + *I just ate the apple at (2, 1), so my tail didn't move last turn. I'm effectively 7 segments long now.*\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (6, 7)\n    *   **Enemy Body:** [(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]\n    *   **Score:** 6 vs 7. I need another apple!\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL - DON'T DIE NOW!):**\n    *   **UP to (2, 2):** **DEADLY.** This is my own body (neck)! I would crash into myself.\n    *   **DOWN to (2, 0):** Board shows an apple `(2, 0)`! My body is clear (lowest is (2, 2)). Enemy is clear. **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 1):** Board is empty. My body is clear. Enemy is clear. **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (3, 1):** Board is empty. My body is clear. Enemy is clear. **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **DOWN to (2, 0):** **FREE FOOD!** There is literally an apple waiting for me. Eating this ties the score at 7-7 and grows my body again. Position (2, 0) is on the bottom edge, keeping me safe from the right side chaos.\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 1):** Safe, but moves me away from the apple at (2, 0) and leaves it exposed. I lose momentum.\n    *   **RIGHT to (3, 1):** Safe, but moves me toward the center while ignoring free food. The enemy is at (6, 7), far away, so I can afford to eat.\n\n4.  **Strategic Consideration:**\n    *   **Enemy Intent:** Snake #1 is at (6, 7). He's likely chasing the apple at (8, 8) or (6, 6?) or moving down. He is NOT a threat to me right now.\n    *   **My Goal:** **SCORE.** I'm trailing by 1. Taking the apple at (2, 0) is the safest, most efficient way to tie.\n    *   **Future Planning:** Eating at (2, 0) anchors me to the bottom-left corner. From there, I can sweep the bottom row or move left towards (0, 0) to dominate the lower territory.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   The apple is right there. I need the point.\n    *   **DOWN** is the move. Secure the food, tie the game, and maintain control of the bottom edge.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove **DOWN** to (2, 0) to eat the apple. Next turn, I'll look to sweep the bottom row (moving LEFT to (1, 0) or (0, 0)) or move UP to (1, 0) if needed. I need to keep growing to match the enemy's size. Once I'm big enough, I'll cut him off at the center.\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze the board.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (2, 0)\n    *   **My Body:** [(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (6, 8)\n    *   **Score:** 7 vs 7. Tied up!\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **UP to (2, 1):** **DEADLY.** This is my own body! I just came from there. (2, 1) is the second segment in my list.\n    *   **DOWN to (2, -1):** **DEADLY.** Off the board. I'm at y=0, the bottom edge.\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 0):** Board shows an apple `(1, 0)`! My body is clear (lowest x is 2, but y is 1+). Enemy is clear. **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (3, 0):** Board shows an apple `(3, 0)`! My body is clear. Enemy is clear. **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 0):** **FREE FOOD!** Apple at (1,0). Ties the score? No, I'm already tied. This grows me to 8 apples. I move towards the left edge.\n    *   **RIGHT to (3, 0):** **FREE FOOD!** Apple at (3,0). Grows me to 8 apples. Moves me towards the center/right side.\n\n4.  **Strategic Consideration:**\n    *   **Enemy Intent:** Snake #1 is at (6, 8). He is near the top-right corner. He likely wants the apple at (8, 8) or (9, 9). He is far away.\n    *   **My Goal:** I need to dominate. I am currently anchored on the bottom row at (2, 0).\n    *   **Positioning:**\n        *   If I go **LEFT** to (1, 0), I am hugging the left wall. This traps me in the corner if I'm not careful, but it secures the bottom-left territory.\n        *   If I go **RIGHT** to (3, 0), I move toward the center of the bottom row. This gives me access to more of the board (bottom row apples at 4, 6, 7, 9).\n    *   **Growth:** Both moves eat an apple. I will have 8 apples either way.\n    *   **Future Options:**\n        *   From (1, 0): Only safe moves next turn will likely be UP to (1, 1) or RIGHT to (2, 0) (which will be empty by then). LEFT is blocked.\n        *   From (3, 0): Safe moves next turn could be UP to (3, 1), LEFT to (2, 0), or RIGHT to (4, 0).\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   I want to stay aggressive and central if possible. Going **RIGHT** to (3, 0) keeps me on the main bottom row artery.\n    *   However, looking at the board state: There is an apple at (4, 0) and (6, 0) and (7, 0) and (9, 0).\n    *   If I go **RIGHT** to (3, 0), I eat one apple. Next turn, I can go RIGHT again to (4, 0) to eat another apple immediately? Wait, (4, 0) has an apple. Yes!\n    *   If I go **LEFT** to (1, 0), I eat one apple. Next turn, I might be forced to move UP or RIGHT.\n    *   **Domination:** I want to control the bottom row. The bottom row is rich with apples: (0,0) empty, (1,0) apple, (2,0) empty, (3,0) apple, (4,0) apple, (5,0) empty, (6,0) apple, (7,0) apple, (8,0) empty, (9,0) apple.\n    *   By going **RIGHT**, I position myself to sweep the row. By going LEFT, I go to the edge.\n    *   **Killing potential:** If I go RIGHT, I might eventually cross paths with the enemy if he comes down, but he's at (6,8) right now.\n    *   Let's look at the apple at (3,0). It's there. It's safe.\n    *   Let's look at the apple at (1,0). It's there. It's safe.\n    *   Actually, looking closer at the board:\n        Row 0: `. A 0 A A . A A . A`\n        Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        My head is at index 2.\n        Apple at index 1 (Left) and index 3 (Right).\n    *   If I go Left to (1,0), I eat. Then I can go Left to (0,0) (empty) or Up to (1,1).\n    *   If I go Right to (3,0), I eat. Then I can go Right to (4,0) (apple!) or Up to (3,1).\n    *   **Chain Eating:** Going RIGHT sets up a chain. (3,0) -> (4,0) -> ... is very likely.\n    *   Going LEFT goes to the corner (0,0). While safe, it limits my angles.\n    *   I will choose **RIGHT**. I need to sweep the bottom row and move towards the center to cut off the enemy if he descends.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove **RIGHT** to (3, 0) to eat the apple and set up a sweep of the bottom row. Next turn, I will likely go RIGHT again to (4, 0) for another apple. I need to keep the pressure on and grow faster than the enemy. Once I have a size advantage, I will hunt him down in the center.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's look at the board and plan the attack.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (3, 0)\n    *   **My Body:** [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (7, 8)\n    *   **Score:** 8 vs 7. We are winning!\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **UP to (3, 1):** Board shows an apple `(3, 1)`! My body is clear (lowest y is 0). Enemy is clear. **SAFE.**\n    *   **DOWN to (3, -1):** **DEADLY.** Off the board.\n    *   **LEFT to (2, 0):** **DEADLY.** That's my own body! (The second segment in my list).\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 0):** Board shows an apple `(4, 0)`! My body is clear. Enemy is clear. **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP to (3, 1):** **FREE FOOD!** Apple at (3,1). This grows me to 9 apples. Moves me into the interior, opening up the board.\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 0):** **FREE FOOD!** Apple at (4,0). This grows me to 9 apples. Keeps me on the bottom row.\n\n4.  **Strategic Consideration:**\n    *   **Enemy Intent:** Snake #1 is at (7, 8). He's near the top-right. He likely wants the apple at (8, 8) or is setting up to come down.\n    *   **My Goal:** Dominate the board and cut off the enemy's expansion.\n    *   **Positioning:**\n        *   If I go **RIGHT** to (4, 0), I continue hugging the bottom row. I risk trapping myself if I hit the right wall without a clear path out. However, there are apples at (6,0) and (7,0) I could sweep.\n        *   If I go **UP** to (3, 1), I enter the \"open water\" of the board. I have more freedom to move. From (3,1), I can access (3,2) (empty), (4,1) (empty), (2,1) (empty in one turn), etc. I also eat the apple.\n    *   **Future Options:**\n        *   From (4, 0): Next turn, I can go RIGHT to (5,0) (empty), or UP to (4,1) (empty). LEFT is blocked by my body (3,0) will be occupied by my neck? Wait, if I move Right to (4,0), my body becomes [(3,0), (2,0), ...]. So LEFT back to (3,0) would be hitting my own neck (backwards). So from (4,0), I'd be restricted to RIGHT or UP. That's only 2 options.\n        *   From (3, 1): Next turn, I can go UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0) (empty), LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (4,1). That's **4 options**. This keeps my future moves OPEN.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   The board state shows my body is packed on the bottom left.\n    *   I have an apple at (3,1) right in front of me.\n    *   Taking the apple at (3,1) and moving into the center is strictly better for mobility than staying on the edge.\n    *   I need to avoid getting boxed in. Moving UP opens the vertical axis.\n    *   Also, looking at the board grid:\n        Row 1: `. . T A . . A . . .`\n        (3,1) is indeed an 'A'.\n    *   Moving UP secures the apple and gives me maximum flexibility for the next turn. Moving RIGHT keeps me on the edge, which is dangerous.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove **UP** to (3, 1) to eat the apple and gain board control. From there, I will look to cut across the center (y=2, y=3) to intercept the enemy if he tries to descend from the top right. I need to maintain my score lead and keep my escape routes open.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 21 and we are neck-and-neck in the scoreline! Both at 9 apples. The opponent is camped out at (8, 9) while I'm holding down the fort at (4, 1). I just broke out of my own body trap by moving RIGHT to (4, 1) last turn. Now, looking at the board, I see apples dropping like crazy, but I need to stay focused on the opponent.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (4, 1)\n    *   **My Body:** [(3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)] (The tail at (4, 5) will move forward, freeing up (4, 4) eventually).\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (8, 9)\n    *   **Score:** 9 vs 9. We are tied! Time to play chess, not just checkers.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **UP to (4, 2):** Board shows empty space. My body is nowhere near there. **SAFE.**\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 0):** Board shows `(4, 0)` is an apple! (Check the board: Row 0: `... 4 0 ...` and the apple list includes (4, 0)). **SAFE (and Tasty).**\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 1):** Board shows `(3, 1)` is my neck/body. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 1):** Board shows `(5, 1)` is empty. **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (4, 2):** Moves me into the center, opens up routes to the top. But it's not food.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 0):** This lands me on an apple! Eating allows me to grow, keeping my length up for potential collisions. The bottom row is packed with apples and my own tail/other segments, but (4, 0) is clear.\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 1):** Moves me East. Opens up the right side of the board.\n\n4.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **The Score:** We are tied at 9. I need to eat to maintain pressure. If I don't eat, and he eats, I fall behind.\n    *   **The Opponent:** He's at (8, 9). He is far away, crowding the top-right corner. He has limited mobility up there.\n    *   **Positioning:**\n        *   If I go **DOWN** to (4, 0), I get the apple. I grow. However, the bottom row is getting crowded. I have body parts at (3,0) and (2,0). Moving down keeps me low.\n        *   If I go **UP** to (4, 2), I move into the open center area. This gives me flexibility to chase apples at (5, 6) or (2, 6) later.\n        *   If I go **RIGHT** to (5, 1), I move toward the right side. There is an apple at (6, 1). That is a two-turn setup.\n    *   **The Aggression:** Since we are tied, I need to force him into a mistake. Staying central (UP) or going Right puts me in a better position to intercept him if he tries to cross the board.\n    *   **The Apple Logic:** (4, 0) is right there. It's free real estate. But, looking at the board state, (4, 0) is surrounded by my own body segments at (3,0) and (2,0) and an apple at (5,0). If I eat (4,0), my tail moves, but I might squeeze myself.\n    *   **Alternative - UP:** Moving UP to (4,2) is safer long-term. It unstacks me from the bottom-left corner. The bottom left is becoming a cage. I need to get out.\n    *   **Alternative - RIGHT:** (5,1) is open. There is an apple at (6,1). I could head there. But is that too predictable?\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   I'm going **UP**.\n    *   Why? The bottom-left area is getting too crowded with my own body. I need to escape the corner.\n    *   (4, 2) is currently empty.\n    *   This move opens up the center of the board.\n    *   From (4, 2), I can pivot left or right next turn. It keeps my options the most open.\n    *   Eating the apple at (4, 0) is tempting, but staying mobile is better against a distant enemy. If I go down, I trap myself in the corner against the wall. If I go up, I control the flow of the game.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEscape the bottom-left corner density. The opponent is stalled at (8,9). I will take the center (4,2) to maintain board control and flexibility. Next turn, I'll look at the apple at (5,6) or cut off the opponent's path if he drops down.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am moving **UP** to the center to keep my future options open and avoid getting boxed in by my own tail.\n\nUP",

The opponent is still lurking at (7, 9) in the top right. He's trapped in a corner over there. Meanwhile, I'm free in the center.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (4, 2)\n    *   **My Body:** [(4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (7, 9) - He hasn't moved much. He's scared!\n    *   **Score:** 9 vs 9. It's a race to 10.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **UP to (4, 3):** Board shows `(4, 3)` is my own body (the end of the list). **DEADLY.** I just grew into that spot last turn? Wait, looking at the board, Row 3 shows `... T T . . . A`. Let's check my body list. My head is (4,2). The body is (4,1), (3,1)... (4,3) is indeed in my body list. So UP kills me.\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 1):** This is my neck. **DEADLY.** Backwards is illegal.\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 2):** Board shows `(3, 2)` is occupied by a 'T' (tail/body). Looking at my body list, (3, 2) is present. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 2):** Board shows `(5, 2)` is empty ('.'). **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n    *   Wait, hold on. Let's re-read the board state carefully.\n        *   Row 2: `. . T T 0 . . . . .`\n        *   My head is at (4,2). The '0' is my head.\n        *   The 'T's are at (2,2) and (3,2).\n        *   So (3,2) is indeed a body part.\n        *   My body list is: `[(4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]`.\n        *   Head: (4,2).\n        *   Next: (4,1) - DOWN from head. Correct.\n        *   Next: (3,1) - LEFT from (4,1).\n        *   ...\n        *   (3,2) is in the list.\n        *   (4,3) is in the list.\n    *   So, UP (4,3) is blocked by my body.\n    *   LEFT (3,2) is blocked by my body.\n    *   DOWN (4,1) is blocked by my neck.\n    *   **RIGHT (5,2):** The board shows `.` (empty). My body list does not contain (5,2). **This is the only safe move.**\n\n4.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   I am forced to move RIGHT. That's okay! It keeps me moving.\n    *   Where does RIGHT take me? (5, 2).\n    *   From (5, 2), where am I going? I'm moving towards the right side of the board.\n    *   Is there an apple nearby? Let's look at the board again.\n        *   Row 1: `. . T T T . A . . .` -> Apple at (6,1).\n        *   Row 2: `. . T T 0 . . . . .` -> No apple.\n        *   Row 3: `. . . T T . . . . A` -> Apple at (9,3).\n        *   Row 5: `A . . . . . T T A .` -> Apple at (0,5) and (8,5).\n        *   Row 6: `. . A . . . A . T .` -> Apple at (2,6) and (6,6).\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (5,2) sets me up to potentially grab the apple at (6,1) next turn (if I go DOWN-DOWN) or head towards the center apples like (2,6) or (6,6).\n    *   The opponent is at (7,9). He is stuck in the top right. If I move RIGHT, I am moving closer to the right side of the board. I can cut him off if he tries to drop down.\n    *   However, I am in a slight squeeze. My tail is at (4,3) and (3,3). Wait, my tail is actually the last element of the list: (4,3)? No, the list ends with (4,3)? Wait, let's trace the tail again.\n        *   Head (4,2)\n        *   (4,1)\n        *   (3,1)\n        *   (3,0)\n        *   (2,0)\n        *   (2,1)\n        *   (2,2)\n        *   (3,2)\n        *   (3,3)\n        *   (4,3)\n    *   Actually, looking at the \"YOUR SNAKE\" description in the prompt:\n        *   \"Head: (4, 2)\"\n        *   \"Body: [(4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]\"\n    *   So the tail is (4,3). That is the very last element.\n    *   My body occupies (4,3). That means (4,3) is part of my body.\n    *   So if I move UP to (4,3), I hit my own body. Correct.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (5,2), I leave (4,2) (my old head). My tail (4,3) will move to (4,2) (trailing behind).\n    *   So (4,3) will become (4,2). (4,2) is currently occupied by my head. When I move, my head moves to (5,2), and the body shifts. The cell (4,3) becomes free (my tail moves forward).\n    *   So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   I am forced to move RIGHT to (5, 2).\n    *   This is actually a good thing. It breaks me out of the left side and moves me toward the center-right.\n    *   The opponent is at (7,9). He is locked in a corner.\n    *   I need to secure food. The apple at (6,1) is accessible.\n    *   Next turn, from (5,2), I can go DOWN to (5,1) or (5,0), or LEFT (back to 4,2, which will be empty), or UP (4,3 might be empty? No, (4,3) will move to (4,2)? No, the tail moves forward. (4,3) becomes (4,2). (3,3) becomes (3,2)...\n    *   Let's just focus on the immediate move.\n    *   The only safe move is RIGHT.\n    *   This moves me toward the center.\n    *   The enemy is trapped. I just need to survive and eat. Since I have to go RIGHT, I will go RIGHT.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nForced move RIGHT to (5,2). This is actually good\u2014it pulls me out of the tight left corner and moves me toward the center apples. The opponent is still boxed in top-right. From (5,2), I'll look to snag the apple at (6,1) or (2,6) depending on his movement. I need to eat to keep the pressure on. \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am moving **RIGHT** to (5, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

The opponent is still stuck at (7, 9) in the top right. He's basically a corner snake right now. I need to secure the lead!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (5, 2)\n    *   **My Body:** `[(4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]` (Tail is (4, 3)).\n    *   **Board at Row 2:** `. . T T T 0 . . . .`\n    *   **Apple Check:** I see an apple at **(6, 1)** and **(6, 6)** nearby. The apple at **(8, 5)** is also reachable but further.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **UP to (5, 3):** The board shows Row 3 at col 5 is `.` (empty). My body list doesn't contain (5, 3). **SAFE.**\n    *   **DOWN to (5, 1):** The board shows Row 1 at col 5 is `.` (empty). My body list doesn't contain (5, 1). **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 2):** This is my *previous* head position. My body follows immediately. Moving back into my old neck is illegal (hitting myself). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 2):** The board shows Row 2 at col 6 is `.` (empty). My body list doesn't contain (6, 2). **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (5, 3):** Safe, but takes me away from the apple at (6, 1).\n    *   **DOWN (5, 1):** Safe. This positions me to eat the **apple at (6, 1)** on the very next turn (by moving RIGHT).\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 2):** Safe. This positions me *next to* the apple at (6, 1), but I would have to move DOWN next turn to eat it. However, looking at the board, Row 1 at col 6 is an apple `A`!\n    *   **WAIT!** Let's look closer at the apple list and board.\n        *   Board Row 1: `. . T T T . A . . .` -> Apple at **(6, 1)**.\n        *   Apple List: (6, 1) is indeed listed.\n    *   If I go **RIGHT to (6, 2)**, I am adjacent to the apple at (6, 1). But can I eat it immediately? No, I have to wait for next turn.\n    *   If I go **DOWN to (5, 1)**, I am also adjacent to (6, 1).\n    *   Let's look at the board again.\n        *   Row 2: `. . T T T 0 . . . .`\n        *   Row 1: `. . T T T . A . . .`\n    *   My body is at (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1) on Row 1. The path to (6, 1) is open.\n    *   **Is there an apple DIRECTLY in front of me?**\n        *   UP (5, 3): No apple.\n        *   DOWN (5, 1): No apple (but adjacent to (6,1)).\n        *   RIGHT (6, 2): No apple (but adjacent to (6,1)).\n    *   Wait, let me check the **Apple List** again. `(6, 1)` is in the list. `(9, 3)` is in the list.\n    *   Is there an apple at (5, 2)? No, that's where I am now.\n    *   Is there an apple at (5, 3)? No.\n    *   Is there an apple at (5, 1)? No.\n    *   Is there an apple at (6, 2)? No.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating Coordinates:**\n        *   Row 1: `. . T T T . A . . .`\n        *   The `A` is at column 6. So (6, 1) is an apple.\n        *   I am at (5, 2).\n        *   To eat the apple, I need to be at (6, 1).\n        *   Next turn, from (5, 2), I can go DOWN to (5, 1) and then RIGHT to (6, 1).\n        *   Or I can go RIGHT to (6, 2) and then DOWN to (6, 1).\n    *   **BUT WAIT!** I might be missing something.\n        *   Row 0: `. A T T T . A A . A`\n        *   Row 0 has apples at (1,0), (6,0), (7,0), (9,0).\n        *   If I go DOWN twice (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0), I hit (5, 0). Is there an apple? No.\n    *   **Strategic Play:**\n        *   The opponent is at (7, 9).\n        *   I need to eat.\n        *   **UP (5, 3):** Moves me away from food. Bad.\n        *   **RIGHT (6, 2):** Puts me in a column with an apple below (6, 1). This seems like a good line of approach. From (6, 2), I can go DOWN to (6, 1) and EAT.\n        *   **DOWN (5, 1):** Puts me in row 1. From (5, 1), I can go RIGHT to (6, 1) and EAT.\n\n    *   **Comparing RIGHT (6, 2) vs DOWN (5, 1):**\n        *   (6, 2) is closer to the right side (center) and sets me up for the apple at (6, 1).\n        *   (5, 1) is closer to the left side.\n        *   The opponent is on the right (7, 9). I should probably push right to cut him off or control the center.\n        *   Also, looking at Row 2: `. . T T T 0 . . . .`\n        *   If I go **RIGHT**, I enter column 6.\n        *   If I go **DOWN**, I enter row 1.\n    *   **Wait, let me look at the board again.**\n        *   Row 2: `. . T T T 0 . . . .`\n        *   Row 1: `. . T T T . A . . .`\n        *   Row 3: `. . . T T . . . . A`\n        *   Row 6: `. . A . . . A . T .` (Apple at (2,6) and (6,6)).\n    *   I am at (5, 2). (6, 1) is an apple.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (5, 1) puts me directly next to the apple (6, 1).\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 2) also puts me directly next to the apple (6, 1).\n    *   However, look at the space around me.\n        *   If I go **RIGHT (6, 2)**: I open up space behind me. My tail (currently (4,3)) will move to (4,2), then (4,1)... freeing up the left side.\n        *   The opponent is on the right. I should be aggressive on the right side.\n        *   From (6, 2), I am on the \"Apple Line\" (Row 2/1).\n        *   From (5, 1), I am on Row 1.\n    *   **Let's look at the immediate kill potential.**\n        *   The opponent is at (7, 9). He is trapped. He can move to (6,9), (7,8), (8,9).\n        *   I don't need to rush him. I need to eat.\n        *   The apple at (6, 1) is the closest.\n    *   **Is there an apple at (6, 2)? No.**\n    *   **Is there an apple at (5, 3)? No.**\n    *   **Is there an apple at (5, 1)? No.**\n    *   **Is there an apple at (6, 2)? No.**\n    *   **Wait, looking at Row 0...**\n        *   Row 0: `. A T T T . A A . A`\n        *   There is an apple at **(6, 0)**.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (5, 1) -> DOWN to (5, 0), I miss (6, 0) by 1 tile.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (6, 2) -> DOWN to (6, 1) -> DOWN to (6, 0). I can eat two apples!\n    *   **Wait, let's look at the Apple List again.**\n        *   (6, 0) is in the list? Yes.\n        *   (6, 1) is in the list? Yes.\n    *   So there is a vertical line of apples at (6, 1) and (6, 0) (and (7,0) but that's blocked by my body or reachable later).\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 2) aligns me perfectly with the column 6 apples.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (5, 1) aligns me with row 1.\n    *   From (5, 1), I can go RIGHT to (6, 1) (Eat), then DOWN to (6, 0) (Eat).\n    *   From (6, 2), I can go DOWN to (6, 1) (Eat), then DOWN to (6, 0) (Eat).\n    *   Both paths allow eating (6,1).\n    *   However, if I go **RIGHT**, I am moving towards the right side of the board where the opponent is. This is the \"Aggressive\" play. I cut off his escape route if he tries to drop down from column 7.\n    *   If I stay LEFT (going DOWN to 5,1), I am moving away from the opponent.\n    *   **Strategy:** Dominate the board. Push towards the enemy. Secure the apples in column 6.\n    *   **RIGHT** puts me at (6, 2).\n    *   **DOWN** puts me at (5, 1).\n\n    *   Let's check safety again.\n    *   **UP:** Blocked by body (My body is at (4,3), (3,3)... (5,3) is empty actually? Wait, Row 3: `. . . T T . . . . A`. Col 5 is `.`. So UP is safe but bad for apples.\n    *   **DOWN:** Safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** Blocked by own neck (4,2).\n    *   **RIGHT:** Safe.\n\n    *   **Decision:**\n    *   I want to eat the apple at (6, 1).\n    *   I want to control the center/right.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 2)** is the most aggressive move. It puts me in the column with the food and closer to the enemy's potential path.\n    *   **DOWN (5, 1)** is safe, but puts me one tile further left.\n    *   Let's go **RIGHT**. It sets up a nice line for (6,1) and (6,0).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (6, 2) to align with the vertical apples at (6, 1) and (6, 0). This positions me to eat next turn and cuts off the right side of the board from the enemy. If the enemy drops down from (7,9), I'll be ready to intercept or block. I need these points to break the tie.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am moving **RIGHT** to (6, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

The opponent is still cornered in the top right, but I need to secure food and control the board to force a win.\n\nLet's look at the board state.\nMy Head: (6, 2) (After moving RIGHT last turn).\nMy Body: `[(5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)]`\nWait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt for the *current* turn (Turn 24):\n`2 . . T T T T 0 . . .`\nMy body is represented as `T`s at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2).\nThe head is at (6,2).\n\nLet's check the board for apples.\nRow 1: `. . T T T . A . . .` -> Apple at **(6, 1)**.\nRow 0: `. A T T T . A A . A` -> Apples at (6,0), (7,0).\nRow 6: `. . A . . . A . T .` -> Apples at (2,6), (6,6).\n\nI am at (6, 2).\nPotential moves:\n- **UP to (6, 3):**\n  - Board shows Row 3: `. . . T T . . . . A` -> (6, 3) is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n  - Is there an apple? No.\n  - Does it lead to a trap? Not immediately.\n  - However, the opponent is at (5,9). Moving UP takes me further from the immediate apples at (6,1) and (6,0) and the opponent.\n\n- **DOWN to (6, 1):**\n  - Board shows Row 1: `. . T T T . A . . .` -> (6, 1) is `A` (Apple).\n  - Is it safe? Yes, it's an apple. Eating it is good!\n  - Is it blocked? No, it's an apple.\n  - **Wait, checking rules.** \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment\".\n  - **Is there any risk of collision?**\n    - My body is at (5,2), (4,2)... (6,1) is not in my body.\n    - The opponent is at (5,9).\n    - **Simultaneous Movement:** The opponent moves at the same time.\n    - Where can the opponent go?\n      - (5,9) -> (4,9) [Apple listed there], (5,8) [Body? `[(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6)]` -> (5,8) is empty], (6,9) [Body], (5,10) [Out of bounds].\n    - The opponent will likely go for food. (4,9) is an apple. (5,8) is safe.\n    - If the opponent goes DOWN to (5,8), we are at (6,1). No collision.\n    - If the opponent goes LEFT to (4,9), we are at (6,1). No collision.\n    - **Head-on collision risk?**\n      - If opponent moves to (6,1)? Impossible, he is at (5,9). Manhattan distance is huge.\n      - If opponent moves to (6,2)? Impossible.\n    - **Is (6, 1) safe from other snakes?** Yes.\n    - **Is (6, 1) safe from my own body?** Yes.\n    - **Is (6, 1) out of bounds?** No.\n\n- **LEFT to (5, 2):**\n  - This is my previous position. My body is there (specifically (5,2) is the next segment).\n  - Moving LEFT puts my head into my own body. **DEADLY.** (Backwards move into self).\n  - **ELIMINATED.**\n\n- **RIGHT to (7, 2):**\n  - Board shows Row 2: `. . T T T T 0 . . .` -> (7, 2) is `.` (Empty).\n  - Safe.\n  - However, it moves me away from the apple at (6,1).\n  - It moves me away from the opponent (who is top left relative to me? No, opponent is top right at (5,9)). Actually, (7,2) is roughly \"under\" the opponent's column.\n  - But (6,1) is food. Food is growth. Growth is board control.\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n1.  **LEFT:** Death. Eliminated.\n2.  **UP:** Safe, but moves away from the closest food and the opponent.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Safe, but moves away from the closest food.\n4.  **DOWN:** Safe, leads to eating an apple immediately.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need to eat to grow. The apple at (6,1) is right there.\nEating it puts me at 10 apples.\nFrom (6,1), I can then move to (6,0) (another apple listed in the apple drop list: (6,0)) or (7,0) or (5,0).\nWait, looking at Row 0: `. A T T T . A A . A`\n(6,0) is an apple.\n(7,0) is an apple.\nSo moving DOWN to (6,1) sets me up to eat another apple on the next turn.\n\n**Risk Assessment of DOWN (to 6,1):**\nIs there any scenario where (6,1) becomes unsafe *simultaneously*?\n- Enemy at (5,9).\n- Enemy moves max 1 step.\n- Enemy cannot reach (6,1).\n- Enemy cannot reach (6,2) or (7,1) in one turn to cause a squeeze?\n- If enemy moves to (6,9) or (7,8), it's far away.\n- **Vibe Check:** Eating the apple is the play. It secures the lead (10-9).\n\nWait, I need to be careful.\nIf I go DOWN to (6,1), I eat the apple. I grow. My tail stays longer (or rather, the segment at the end doesn't move this turn because I ate? No, wait.\nRule: \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment\".\nThis means the tail does *not* move forward this turn. The body extends.\nMy current tail is at... looking at the list `[(5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)]`. The last one is (3,2).\nIf I eat, (3,2) stays. A new segment is added at (6,2) (my current head).\nSo my new body is (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (5,2)...\n\nIs there a trap?\nLet's look at the board again.\n`2 . . T T T T 0 . . .`\nI am at (6,2).\nIf I go DOWN to (6,1):\nNext turn, I will be at (6,1).\nI will have apple at (6,1).\nNext move options from (6,1):\n- UP (back to 6,2) - Safe (my body is there but it moved? No, (6,2) is now part of my body).\n- DOWN to (6,0) - Apple there.\n- LEFT to (5,1) - Empty (Row 1 shows `. . T T T . A...` -> col 5 is `.`).\n- RIGHT to (7,1) - Empty (Row 1 col 7 is `.`).\n\nThe path is open. The opponent is trapped in the corner.\nI need to score to win.\n\nLet's double check the opponent's position and threat.\nOpponent Head: (5,9).\nBody: `[(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6)]`.\nHe is squeezed.\nIf he moves LEFT to (4,9), he hits an apple?\nApple List: (4,9) is in the list. Yes.\nSo he will likely eat (4,9).\nIf he eats, he grows. He might try to drop down.\nBut for now, he is no threat to me at (6,1).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDOWN is safe. DOWN gets food. DOWN puts me at 10 apples. 10-9 lead is better than 9-9.\nI will move DOWN.\n\nWait, one last check.\nIs (6,1) empty?\nBoard Row 1: `. . T T T . A . . .`\nColumn 6 is `A`.\nSo (6,1) is an apple.\nIt is NOT a snake body.\nIt is NOT a wall.\nIt is NOT my own head (I'm at 6,2).\nIt is NOT my own body (My body is at 5,2, 4,2...).\nIt is NOT the enemy head.\nIt is NOT the enemy body.\n\nSafe to move.\n\nFinal Plan:\nMove DOWN to (6,1), eat the apple, take the lead 10-9. From there, target (6,0) or (7,0) next turn to keep growing and dominating the board.\n\nDECISION:\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",

My opponent is still boxed in the top right, but I need to secure the lead and stay aggressive. I have the momentum, and I'm not letting up!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at (6, 1). I just ate the apple there last turn. Let's check the board state.\n    *   **UP to (6, 2):** My body is there. DEAD.\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 0):** Board shows Row 0: `. A T T T . A A . A`. (6, 0) is `A` (Apple). Safe. It's food! I should eat.\n    *   **LEFT to (5, 1):** Board shows Row 1: `. . T T T . A . . .`. (5, 1) is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to (7, 1):** Board shows Row 1: `. . T T T . A . . .`. (7, 1) is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n\n2.  **Analysis:**\n    *   **Opponent Threat:** Snake #1 is at (4, 9). His body is `(5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6)`. He is trapped in the corner. He cannot reach me.\n    *   **Food Opportunity:** (6, 0) is an apple. Eating it puts me at 11 apples. That's a +1 lead!\n    *   **Safety:**\n        *   (6, 0) is an apple, not a snake body.\n        *   (6, 0) is within bounds.\n        *   (6, 0) is not the opponent's head (he's at (4,9)).\n    *   **Long-term plan:** If I eat at (6, 0), I can potentially chain to (7, 0) next turn (since (7, 0) is also an apple) or move left to (5, 0) to open up the bottom row. Moving to (5, 1) or (7, 1) keeps me on the same row but misses the immediate point lead.\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   **Goal:** Win. To win, I need more apples than the opponent.\n    *   **Current Score:** 10 vs 10.\n    *   **Move:** Move DOWN to (6, 0). Eat the apple. Score becomes 11 vs 10. I take the lead.\n    *   **Next Turn:** From (6, 0), I can go RIGHT to (7, 0) (Apple) or LEFT to (5, 0) (Apple? No, Row 0 col 5 is `.`). Actually, Row 0 col 5 is `.` (wait, looking at the string ` . A T T T . A A . A`, indices: 0: ., 1: A, 2: T, 3: T, 4: T, 5: ., 6: A, 7: A, 8: ., 9: A). So (5,0) is empty. (6,0) is A. (7,0) is A.\n    *   Eating at (6,0) secures a point and sets me up to eat at (7,0) if I want to keep growing, or I can maneuver around the bottom. The bottom row is wide open!\n\n    *   **Alternative (Left to 5,1):** No food, no point gain. Keeps the score tied. Not optimal for aggression.\n    *   **Alternative (Right to 7,1):** No food, no point gain.\n    *   **Alternative (Up to 6,2):** Death.\n\n    *   **Verdict:** DOWN is the only move that scores points immediately. Since the opponent is blocked and poses no threat, I should greedily take the apple.\n\n**Final Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (6, 0), eat the apple, take the lead 11-10. Then, set my sights on the apple at (7, 0) to extend my lead further. Dominate the board!\n\nDOWN",

The tail is currently at (3, 2).\n- **Opponent Status:** Snake #1 is still boxed in the top right corner (head at (3, 9)). He's essentially a non-threat at this point\u2014surrounded by his own body and the wall.\n- **Apples Nearby:** (7, 0) is an apple right next to me! Also (5, 0) is empty, (8, 0) is empty.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **CHECK SAFETY FIRST:**\n   - **UP to (6, 1):** MY BODY IS THERE! \ud83d\ude35 That's the cell I just came from (since my head moved down from (6, 1) to (6, 0) last turn). **DEAD** - can't go backwards into myself.\n   - **DOWN to (6, -1):** Off the board! **DEAD.**\n   - **LEFT to (5, 0):** Board shows Row 0: `. A T T T . 0 A . A` (I'm at 6). (5, 0) is `.` (empty). **SAFE.**\n   - **RIGHT to (7, 0):** Board shows Row 0: `. A T T T . 0 A . A`. (7, 0) is `A` (apple). **SAFE.**\n\n2. **STRATEGIC CHOICE:**\n   - **Option LEFT (5, 0):** Empty square. No point gain. Keeps the score at 11-10. I could potentially turn up to (5, 1) next turn (which is empty), but that doesn't net me anything immediately.\n   - **Option RIGHT (7, 0):** **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e Eating it gives me my **12th apple**, extending my lead to 12-10. From there, I can go RIGHT to (8, 0) (empty), or UP to (7, 1) (empty), or eventually loop around the bottom.\n\n3. **AGGRESSION & WIN CONDITION:**\n   - **Chat, we're here to DOMINATE!** The opponent is trapped. I have a clear path to another apple.\n   - **Risk Assessment:** Moving RIGHT to (7, 0) is safe. The opponent cannot reach (7, 0) in time. My tail is at (3, 2), so I'm not trapping myself.\n   - **Long-term:** By eating the apple at (7, 0), I open up the bottom row. I can then move along the bottom to collect more apples (like (8, 5), (9, 3), etc.) while the opponent slowly starves in the corner.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nGrab the apple at **(7, 0)**. Extend the lead. Keep the pressure on.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT",

          "rationale": "**TURN 27 ANALYSIS \ud83d\udd25**\n\n**CHAT, WE ROLLIN'!** I'm at 12 apples, opponent at 11. I grabbed that apple at (7, 0) last turn (you saw the clip!). Now I'm at (7, 0), head on the apple spot. My body is following behind from (6, 0) to (3, 2). The opponent is still trapped up top at (2, 9).\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (7, 0) - just ate, grew to length 13.\n- **Board Visualization (Bottom Row):** `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` -> `. A T T T . 0 A . A` (Wait, let's look closer. The board shows: `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A` Actually, looking at the board state provided in the prompt: `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A` is the visual representation. Let's parse it accurately.)\n    - (0,0): `.`\n    - (1,0): `A` (Apple)\n    - (2,0): `T` (My tail? No, wait. My body is at (2,0)? Let's check my body list: `... (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)...` Yes, (2,0) is my body.\n    - (3,0): `T` (My body)\n    - (4,0): `T` (My body? No, my body is `... (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)...` Wait, I moved RIGHT from (6,0) to (7,0). My tail at (3,2) stays. The body list shifts. (4,0) is actually an empty spot `.` according to the prompt board state `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A`. Wait, that text string is confusing.)\n    - Let's rely on the Board State provided by the system:\n      `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A`\n      Indexes: 0: ., 1: A, 2: T, 3: T, 4: T, 5: ., 6: T, 7: 0, 8: ., 9: A.\n      (0,0) = `.`\n      (1,0) = `A`\n      (2,0) = `T` (My body)\n      (3,0) = `T` (My body)\n      (4,0) = `T` (My body? No, my body is at (4,2), (4,1)... (4,0) might be empty. Wait, the prompt says `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A`. That's 10 chars. It seems `T` covers occupied spots.\n      Actually, let's look at my coordinates:\n      Head: (7, 0)\n      Body: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)]\n      So on Row 0: (6,0) is body, (3,0) is body, (2,0) is body.\n      The board says: `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A` at y=0.\n      (0,0): `.`\n      (1,0): `A`\n      (2,0): `T` (Matches my body)\n      (3,0): `T` (Matches my body)\n      (4,0): `T` (Wait, my body isn't at (4,0)? It's at (4,1) and (4,2). Maybe it's an obstacle or a mistake in my reading? No, wait. (5,0) is `.` according to the board. (6,0) is `T` (My body). (7,0) is `0` (Me). (8,0) is `.` (Empty). (9,0) is `A` (Apple).\n      Let's re-verify my body. `(4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)...`\n      Ah, (4,0) is NOT in my body list. It must be empty. But the board string `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A` suggests index 4 is `T`. Is it an opponent body? No, opponent is at top.\n      Is it an old part of my body? No.\n      Wait, look at my body: `(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)...`\n      (5,0) is NOT in my body.\n      (4,0) is NOT in my body.\n      (3,0) IS in my body.\n      (2,0) IS in my body.\n      (1,0) is Apple.\n      (0,0) is Empty.\n      Why does the board say `T` at index 4 (which corresponds to x=4)? Maybe it's a visual artifact or the board state is slightly delayed? Or maybe my previous body included (4,0)? No, I started at (7,0) and moved from (6,0).\n      Let's check the prompt's \"YOUR SNAKE\" list again: `... (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)...`\n      It seems the board visualization might have a `T` at (4,0) due to a bug or a snake I'm not tracking? But I only have one opponent. Let's trust my explicit coordinate list over the ASCII art if there's a conflict, but usually the ASCII is correct.\n      Actually, looking closely at the provided ASCII:\n      `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A`\n      (5,0) is `.` (Correct, empty).\n      (6,0) is `T` (Correct, my body).\n      (4,0) is `T`? Wait, my body is at (4,2) and (4,1). It is NOT at (4,0).\n      Is it possible (4,0) is actually empty? Or is it a \"T\" representing something else?\n      Let's assume the ASCII is accurate. If (4,0) is `T`, it must be my body (since only I am bottom there).\n      Maybe my body list is `(4, 1), (3, 1)...` wait, if I moved `(6,0)->(7,0)`, the old head `(6,0)` becomes body. The old tail `(3,2)` drops off.\n      My body is: `(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)...`\n      Okay, `(4,0)` is NOT in that list. It must be an error in my reading of the ASCII string or the string itself.\n      Let's look at the string again: `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A`\n      Chars: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n      Index 4 is `T`.\n      Index 5 is `.`.\n      If Index 4 is `T` (x=4), and my body is `(4,2), (4,1)`, maybe (4,0) is actually empty? Or maybe I missed a body part?\n      Let's assume the explicit coordinates given in \"YOUR SNAKE\" are the truth. `(4,0)` is NOT in the list.\n      However, the ASCII is the \"Ground Truth\" of the board state *after* my move.\n      If the ASCII says `(4,0)` is `T`, and it's not my body... that's impossible unless I'm missing something.\n      Wait, let's look at the body list again: `... (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)...`\n      Ah! I might have misread the ASCII. `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A`\n      Let's map coordinates:\n      (0,0) = `.`\n      (1,0) = `A`\n      (2,0) = `T`\n      (3,0) = `T`\n      (4,0) = `T`\n      (5,0) = `.`\n      (6,0) = `T`\n      (7,0) = `0`\n      (8,0) = `.`\n      (9,0) = `A`\n      \n      My body at y=0: (2,0), (3,0), (6,0).\n      (4,0) is NOT in my body list provided. But the board says `T`.\n      Is it possible `(4,0)` is occupied by something else? No.\n      Is it possible my body list is `(5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)...` wait, (4,0) is missing.\n      Maybe the ASCII `T` at index 4 is actually empty? Or maybe it's a glitch in the prompt? Or maybe I am misinterpreting `T`?\n      Let's assume the ASCII is correct and I am just blind.\n      Actually, looking at my body: `(4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1)...`\n      (4, 0) is free.\n      But the board says `T` at (4,0).\n      Maybe it's `(4,0)` is `T`? Or maybe the list `(5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1)`... wait, did I drop a tail? Yes, `(3, 2)` dropped.\n      Let's check the ASCII again: `0 . A T T T . T 0 . A`\n      If (4,0) is `T`, it must be my body. Is `(4,0)` in my list? `(4, 1)` is there. `(3, 0)` is there.\n      Maybe the ASCII is slightly wrong or I am miscounting indices.\n      Let's focus on what is definitely safe.\n      \n      **Safety Check:**\n      - (7, 0): My head.\n      - (6, 0): My body (behind me).\n      - (8, 0): `.` (Empty).\n      - (7, 1): `.` (Empty, check row 1: `. . T T T . T . . .` -> (7,1) is `.`).\n      - (7, -1): Off board.\n      \n      **Moves:**\n      1. **RIGHT to (8, 0):** Empty. Safe.\n      2. **UP to (7, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n      3. **LEFT to (6, 0):** My body. **DEAD.**\n      4. **DOWN:** Off board. **DEAD.**\n      \n      **Strategy:**\n      I need to get out of the bottom row eventually. (8, 0) is empty. (9, 0) is an apple but I can't reach it directly from (8,0) without hitting (9,0) which is an apple? No, (9,0) is apple.\n      If I go RIGHT to (8, 0), next turn I can go RIGHT to (9, 0) for an apple.\n      If I go UP to (7, 1), I open up the interior.\n      \n      **Opponent Analysis:**\n      Opponent is at (2, 9). Stuck. I have 12 apples, they have 11.\n      If I eat an apple, I go to 13.\n      (9, 0) is an apple. To get there, I must go to (8, 0) first.\n      \n      **Long Term Plan:**\n      1. Move RIGHT to (8, 0).\n      2. Next turn, move RIGHT to (9, 0) to eat the apple.\n      3. Then move UP to (9, 1) or loop around.\n      (8, 0) is empty. (7, 1) is empty.\n      \n      Is there any trap?\n      If I go RIGHT to (8, 0):\n      My body is at (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0?) No (5,0) is empty.\n      My body: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)...\n      If I go (8,0), next turn I can go (9,0).\n      If I go (9,0), I eat apple.\n      From (9,0), I can go (9,1).\n      (9,1) is empty (Row 1 is `.` at index 9).\n      \n      If I go UP to (7, 1):\n      I don't get an apple immediately.\n      However, going RIGHT leads me to (9,0) apple.\n      (8,0) is safe.\n      (9,0) is safe (Apple).\n      \n      Is (8,0) blocked by anything? No.\n      \n      **Comparison:**\n      - RIGHT: Leads to apple at (9,0). Safe path.\n      - UP: Leads to open space. Slower apple growth.\n      \n      Since I want to maximize apples and domination, going for the guaranteed apple is good. However, I need to make sure (8,0) is truly safe.\n      (8,0) is `.`.\n      \n      Wait, if I go RIGHT to (8,0), my tail moves. (3,2) drops.\n      My body becomes: (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n      (8,0) is free.\n      \n      **Risky play?**\n      Is (9,0) safe next turn?\n      Yes, no one is near it.\n      \n      **Verdict:**\n      Move RIGHT to get into position to eat the apple at (9,0) next turn.\n      Or just eat it now? No, I'm at (7,0). I need to move to (8,0) to get to (9,0).\n      \n      Is there an apple at (8,5). I should eventually move up.\n      But for now, bottom row is clear.\n      \n      **Double check:**\n      Can I go UP?\n      (7, 1) is empty.\n      If I go UP, I might be blocking my own path to (9,0).\n      Going RIGHT secures the bottom lane.\n      \n      **Final Decision:**\n      Go RIGHT.\n      \n      **Plan:**\n      Move RIGHT to (8, 0). Prepare to eat apple at (9, 0) on turn 28.\n\nRIGHT",

Situation Check:**\n- **My Head:** (8, 0)\n- **My Body:** Currently at (7, 0) (right behind me), (6, 0), and snaking up the left side.\n- **Enemy:** Still trapped in the top-right corner at (2, 8).\n- **Apples:** There is an apple at (9, 0) which is immediately to my RIGHT!\n\n**2. Move Elimination:**\n- **LEFT:** Into my own body at (7, 0). **DEAD.**\n- **DOWN:** Off the board (y = -1). **DEAD.**\n- **UP:** To (8, 1). Is it safe?\n  - Looking at the board state: Row 1 at x=8 is `.` (empty).\n  - However, I want that apple at (9, 0) to extend my lead!\n- **RIGHT:** To (9, 0). This is an apple! It's also a safe cell (currently empty).\n\n**3. Strategy & Aggression:**\nThe opponent is stuck way up top. They can't reach me. I have a free apple right in front of me. Taking it extends my body and gives me the score lead (13-12). This is the optimal play. I need to eat to grow and dominate the board.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (9, 0) this turn, my tail will move, opening up space. Next turn, I'll have my head at (9, 0) and I'll look to move UP to (9, 1) to start clearing out the right side of the board or spiral inward.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nGrab the apple. Extend the lead. Keep the momentum.\n\n**MOVE:**\nRIGHT",

Their body is a wall in the top-right corner, but they're slowly backing up the wall. They're trapped in a 2x3 box: (2,7) to (3,7) to (4,7) maybe? Actually, let's scan their body: head (2,7), body (2,8),(2,9),(3,9),(4,9),(5,9),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(8,8),(7,8),(6,8),(6,7). They have a narrow corridor. They're stuck. I need to control the center and right side. Apple at (9,0) is mine. Next, I should move UP to (9,1) to open up the right side and avoid getting boxed in. Check the board: (9,1) is empty ('.' row 1 col 9). Also, moving UP will make my tail (2,2) move? Actually, after eating, my body will be longer. But UP keeps me safe and sets up for spiral. Plan: Move UP to (9,1) next turn, then maybe UP to (9,2) or LEFT to (8,1) to circle. Keep forcing opponent to stay in the corner. If they try to break out, we might meet at (5,6) or (6,7). Be ready to force head-on if I'm ahead. Let's go! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**ANALYSIS FOR TURN 29 \ud83d\udd25**\n\n**1. Situation Check:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 0) (just ate apple, now head is at (9,0))\n- **My Body:** Updated after eating: Head (9,0), body: [(8,0),(7,0),(6,0),(6,1),(6,2),(5,2),(4,2),(4,1),(3,1),(3,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)] (plus the tail moves? Actually, we grow by 1, so tail stays? Wait, we ate apple, so we don't lose tail this turn. Body length increases by 1. So my body is now 14 segments.)\n- **Enemy:** Still at (2,7) with 12 apples. They haven't moved yet this turn; simultaneous move. They might try to move DOWN to (2,6) or RIGHT to (3,7) etc. But they're trapped.\n- **Apples:** We have a new apple list. Apple at (0,5) etc. But we focus on enemy.\n\n**2. Move Elimination:**\n- **LEFT:** To (8,0). That's my own body (since (8,0) is part of my body). DEAD.\n- **DOWN:** Off board (y=-1). DEAD.\n- **UP:** To (9,1). Check safety: (9,1) is empty ('.' row 1 col 9). No enemy body there. Enemy head is at (2,7), not overlapping. Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** Off board (x=10). DEAD.\n\n**3. Strategy & Aggression:**\nOnly safe move is UP. That's good because it keeps me alive and moves me toward the center/right side. I want to dominate the board and avoid getting stuck in the corner. Moving UP opens up future moves: from (9,1) I can go UP to (9,2), LEFT to (8,1), etc. That's multiple options. Meanwhile, opponent is boxed in; they might try to escape down the left wall, but we have time to cut them off. Since I'm ahead (13 vs 12), I should avoid risky head-on collisions and keep growing. If they try to challenge, we can crush them.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving UP to (9,1), next turn I'll consider moving UP again to (9,2) or LEFT to (8,1) to start spiraling inward. I'll keep an eye on their possible moves: they might try to go down to (2,6) or (3,6). I can eventually force them into a dead end. My body is a long wall on the left and bottom; I can use that to trap them. Stay aggressive, but prioritize survival. If they try to cross my path, I can kill them by being in their way (since they'd crash into my body). Let's gooo! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**MOVE:**\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're at turn 30, and it's time to make a move that keeps us alive and keeps the pressure on! Let's break this down.\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 1) \u2014 just moved there last turn.\n- **My Body:** [(9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)] \u2014 that's 13 body segments plus the head = 14 total length. Wait, actually we have 13 apples collected, so we started with length 1, plus 13 growth = 14. Our body list shows 13 segments (plus the head at (9,1) makes 14). All good.\n- **Opponent:** Head at (2, 6), body stretching up to (2,9) and across to (6,7). They're still trapped in that top-right corner. They have 13 apples same as us. They might try to move DOWN to (2,5) or maybe RIGHT to (3,6), but they're still constrained.\n- **Board:** We're at (9,1). Check the board state: Row 1, col 9 is '0' (our head). The space above at (9,2) is '.' (empty). To the left at (8,1) is '.'? Actually row 1, col 8 is '.'? Wait, board row 1: \" . . T T T . T . . 0 \" Let's index columns 0-9: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 'T', col3 'T', col4 'T', col5 '.', col6 'T', col7 '.', col8 '.', col9 '0'. So (8,1) is col8 row1 = '.' \u2014 empty. (9,2) is col9 row2 = 'T'? Row 2: \" . . . . T T T . . . \" col9 is '.'? Actually row2: \" . . . . T T T . . . \" \u2014 columns: 0 '.',1 '.',2 '.',3 '.',4 '.',5 'T',6 'T',7 'T',8 '.',9 '.'. So (9,2) is '.' \u2014 empty. Good.\n- **Apples:** We don't care much, but there's an apple at (8,5), (7,4), etc. Not super relevant for survival.\n\n**MOVE ELIMINATION:**\n- **UP:** To (9,2). Check safety: (9,2) is empty (no body, no enemy body). Enemy head at (2,6) far away. Safe.\n- **DOWN:** To (9,0). That's my own body! (9,0) is my first body segment. That's moving backwards into myself \u2014 DEAD.\n- **LEFT:** To (8,1). Check safety: (8,1) is empty (board shows '.'). No enemy body there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** Off board (x=10) \u2014 DEAD.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nBoth moves are safe. Which gives better future options?\n- UP to (9,2): From there, possible moves next turn: UP to (9,3) (row3 col9 is 'A'? Row3: \" . A . . . . . . . A \" col9 is 'A' \u2014 apple! That's good, but we don't care about apples, but eating grows us. Also LEFT to (8,2) (row2 col8 is '.'), DOWN to (9,1) (my own body segment, but after moving, (9,1) will be empty? Actually, when we move, our tail moves forward, so (9,1) will become body segment? Let's think: if we go UP, our new head is (9,2), old head (9,1) becomes first body segment. So (9,1) will be occupied by my own body. So DOWN from (9,2) would be into my own body \u2014 dangerous! So from (9,2), DOWN is not safe. RIGHT off board. So from (9,2), only UP and LEFT might be safe? Actually, LEFT to (8,2) is empty. So two safe directions: UP and LEFT.\n- LEFT to (8,1): From there, possible moves: UP to (8,2) (empty), LEFT to (7,1) (row1 col7 is '.'), DOWN to (8,0) (my own body? (8,0) is my body segment, but after moving, (8,0) might still be body? Actually, if we go LEFT to (8,1), our old head (9,1) becomes body. Our body currently includes (9,0),(8,0), etc. So (8,0) is already a body segment and will remain so until our tail moves. So DOWN from (8,1) would be into (8,0) \u2014 my own body \u2014 DEAD. RIGHT to (9,1) \u2014 after moving, (9,1) becomes body, so RIGHT would be into my own body? Actually, if we move LEFT to (8,1), then (9,1) is now the first body segment. So from (8,1), RIGHT would be back to (9,1) which is now my own body \u2014 DEAD. So from (8,1), safe moves: UP to (8,2) and LEFT to (7,1). That's two options as well.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT give two future safe options. But UP moves us toward an apple at (9,3) and keeps us near the right edge, while LEFT moves us inward toward the center. Since we want to dominate the board and cut off opponent, moving inward might be better to pressure them. However, staying near the edge could also be a safe spot to spiral later.\n\nBut wait, there's a potential danger: if opponent moves DOWN to (2,5) or something, they might start coming toward us. We have time. But we should also consider that our body is a long wall on the left and bottom. Moving LEFT to (8,1) might help us continue that wall to control the bottom-right area.\n\nActually, looking at the board: our body occupies a path from (2,0) up to (2,1) and then across to (9,0). If we go LEFT to (8,1), we continue that wall. If we go UP to (9,2), we go away from our wall and might create a gap.\n\nBut we need to think about trapping opponent. Opponent is in top-right. If we move UP, we stay on the right edge, potentially cutting off their escape down the right side. If we move LEFT, we move toward the center, which might allow us to intercept them if they try to move down left.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid getting boxed in ourselves. From (9,1), moving UP gives us access to (9,2) and (8,2) and (9,3). Moving LEFT gives access to (8,1) and (7,1) and (8,2). Both are fine.\n\nHowever, there's a subtle point: after moving, our tail will move forward (since we didn't eat an apple this turn). Our tail is currently at (2,2)? Wait, our body list: [(9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1)]. The tail is the last element: (2,1)? Actually the list is head-to-tail, so first is head (9,1) but that's not in the body list? In the description, body list is \"HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\" But in the data, they give: \"Head: (9, 1), Body: [(9, 0), (8, 0), ...]\". So the head is separate, and the body list starts from the segment after head. So tail is the last element of body: (2,1). Wait, but they said last one is tail. So tail is (2,1). But (2,1) is not the end of the snake? Actually, our snake should be continuous. From head (9,1) to body[0] (9,0) is adjacent. Then (9,0) to (8,0) etc. So tail is (2,1). But earlier I thought tail was (2,2)? Let's recalc: our length is 14. Head (9,1) + 13 body segments = 14. The body list has 13 elements. The last element (2,1) is indeed the tail. So when we move, if we don't eat, the tail will move forward to the next segment. That means (2,1) will become empty, and the new tail will be (2,0)? Actually, the tail moves in the direction of the segment before it. The segment before tail is (2,0) (since body list: ... (3,0), (2,0), (2,1)). So tail (2,1) will move to (2,0) if the direction from (2,0) to (2,1) is up? Actually, from (2,0) to (2,1) is UP. So the tail moves UP to (2,1) to (2,0)? Wait, no: when the snake moves, each body segment takes the position of the previous segment. So the tail moves to the position of the segment before it. That means new tail becomes (2,0). So (2,1) becomes empty. That could open up space.\n\nBut that doesn't affect our immediate move decision.\n\nNow, consider opponent's possible moves. They are at (2,6). Their body goes to (2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,9),(4,9),(5,9),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(8,8),(7,8),(6,8),(6,7). So they have a corridor. They might try to move DOWN to (2,5) (currently empty? Row6 col2 is '1'? Actually board row6: \" A . 1 . . A . . . . \" col2 is '1' \u2014 that's the opponent head? Wait, the board shows row6: col0 'A', col1 '.', col2 '1', col3 '.', col4 '.', col5 'A', col6 '.', col7 '.', col8 '.', col9 '.'. So (2,6) is occupied by opponent head '1'. So (2,5) is row5 col2: row5: \" A . . . . . . . A . \" col2 is '.' \u2014 empty. So they can move DOWN to (2,5). That would be safe for them if they don't hit their own body. Their body is behind them: they would be leaving (2,6) empty, and their new head (2,5). Their body would shift, so (2,6) becomes part of body. That seems fine. So they might start moving down the column.\n\nIf they come down, we might meet them in the middle. But we are at (9,1) and they at (2,6). We have many turns before collision.\n\nGiven we are tied in apples (13-13), we want to be aggressive but not reckless. Since we have the whole bottom and right, we should expand our territory.\n\nI think moving LEFT to (8,1) is better because it moves us toward the center, giving us more control. Also, from (8,1), we can then go UP to (8,2) and then LEFT to (7,2) etc., spiraling inward. From (9,2), we are stuck on the edge and might have fewer options later if opponent blocks the right side.\n\nBut we also want to keep the option to eat apples. There's an apple at (9,3) if we go UP. But apples are not the focus; dominating the board is. However, growing gives us more length, which helps in a head-on collision. Since we are tied, we might want to grow a bit more to have a higher score before forcing a collision.\n\nBut we can also get apples later. Right now, survival and positioning are key.\n\nLet's check if moving UP to (9,2) could lead to a trap later. Suppose we go UP, then next turn we go UP to (9,3) and eat apple, growing. Then our body extends further. That might be fine.\n\nBut we have to consider that our body is long. We need to avoid self-collision. Moving UP keeps us near the right edge, where our body is less dense. Our body is mostly on the left and bottom. So UP is safe.\n\nActually, looking at the board, (8,1) is empty, but (8,1) is adjacent to our body at (9,0) and (8,0) and (7,0) etc. If we go to (8,1), we are close to our own body, but that's okay as long as we don't collide.\n\nI think both are fine, but I'll choose LEFT to move toward the center and maintain flexibility. Also, by moving left, we are moving away from the edge where the opponent might eventually try to escape. Actually, opponent is on the right top, so moving left might be toward them? Not really, they are at (2,6), we are at (9,1). Moving left reduces x from 9 to 8, still far.\n\nWait, we want to cut them off. If we go UP, we stay on the right, potentially blocking their escape to the right edge. If we go LEFT, we leave the right edge open, but they are far from the right edge. Actually, the right edge is x=9. Their body is on x=2 to 8? They have a body at (8,9) and (8,8). So they are near the right edge. If we stay on the right edge, we might block them from expanding to x=9. But they are already on x=8, so they might want to go to x=9. By being at (9,1) and moving UP, we are not blocking that high up. Their top is at y=9, x=9 is empty. They could potentially go to (9,9) if they break out. So to block them, we might need to go up and left to cut off that corner.\n\nBut for now, I think moving UP is also good because it's straightforward and keeps us near an apple.\n\nI'll go with UP, as it was my initial safe move and it keeps the momentum upward.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check safety of UP: (9,2) is empty. Also, we must consider simultaneous movement: opponent might move into (9,2) from somewhere? Unlikely, they are at (2,6). No chance. So safe.\n\nThus, I'll move UP.\n\nNow, for the rationale: We need to write a plan for next turn. Since we're moving UP, our next options will be UP or LEFT. We should plan to potentially go UP again to eat the apple at (9,3) or move left to start spiraling.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\n\n**MOVE:** UP\n\nNow, produce the response with rationale and final move.YO CHAT! We're at turn 30 and the pressure is ON! Both snakes are tied at 13 apples, but we're NOT letting that slide. My head is at (9,1) after last turn's UP move. Let's break it down.\n\n**ANALYSIS FOR TURN 30 \ud83d\udd25**\n\n**Situation Check:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 1) \u2014 perfectly positioned on the right edge.\n- **My Body:** Solid wall on the left and bottom, tail at (2,1). Moving UP keeps us away from our own body.\n- **Opponent:** Still boxed in at (2,6) with 13 apples. They're stuck in that corner but might try to break out down the column to (2,5). We need to stay aggressive.\n- **Board State:** (9,2) is empty (row2 col9 is '.'). No enemy bodies nearby. Apple at (9,3) if we want it, but we're focused on enemy control.\n\n**Move Elimination:**\n- **UP:** To (9,2) \u2014 SAFE. No collision, empty space.\n- **LEFT:** To (8,1) \u2014 also safe, but moves toward center.\n- **DOWN:** Into my own body at (9,0) \u2014 DEAD.\n- **RIGHT:** Off board \u2014 DEAD.\n\n**Strategy & Aggression:**\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe, but UP keeps us on the right edge, controlling their potential escape route to (9,9). From (9,2), we'll have options: UP to (9,3) (apple there if we want growth), LEFT to (8,2) (open space), or even DOWN later (but that'll be into our own body after the move, so avoid). Moving UP maintains our vertical dominance and forces the opponent to stay caged. We're already dominating the board with our long body; we just need to keep them trapped and avoid risky head-ons since we're tied in score.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nNext turn, from (9,2), I'll likely go UP to (9,3) to eat the apple and extend our lead, then start spiraling inward to cut off their leftward escape. If they try to challenge, we'll be ready to force a head-on when we have the score advantage. Stay sharp, chat!\n\n**MOVE:**  \nUP",

Apple at (9,3) if we want it, but we're focused on enemy control.\n\n**Move Elimination:**\n- **UP:** To (9,2) \u2014 SAFE. Empty space, no enemy bodies.\n- **LEFT:** To (8,1) \u2014 also safe, but moves toward center.\n- **DOWN:** Into my own body at (9,0) \u2014 DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** Off board \u2014 DEAD. \u274c\n\n**Strategy & Aggression:**\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe. UP keeps us on the right edge, dominating their escape route down the right side. From (9,2), we can go UP to (9,3) next turn (apple there) or LEFT to (8,2). Moving UP forces the opponent to stay caged longer. We're already dominating with our wall; we just need to keep them trapped and avoid reckless head-ons since we're tied. Once we get a lead, we'll force the collision!\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nNext turn from (9,2), likely UP to (9,3) to eat and extend lead, then spiral inward to cut off their leftward escape. If they try to challenge, we'll be ready. Stay aggressive!\n\n**MOVE:**\nUP",

Let's analyze the board state and make a clutch move to box in our archrival! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Turn 32 / 150**\nScore: Tied 14-14\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 3) \u2014 on the right wall, just ate an apple! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **My Body:** A fortress from (2,0) to (9,2), with tail at (2,0)\n- **Opponent:** Head at (2, 4) \u2014 they're trapped between our body and the wall!\n- **Apple Drops:** We're stacked with apples, but enemy control is priority.\n\n**Move Elimination:**\n- **UP (9, 4):** Check board \u2014 empty! Safe.\n- **DOWN (9, 2):** Check board \u2014 \"T\" (our tail)! That's our body \u2014 DEAD. \u274c\n- **LEFT (8, 3):** Check board \u2014 empty! Safe.\n- **RIGHT (9, 4):** That's same as UP \u2014 off board if we try right? No, right would be (10,3) which is off board \u2014 DEAD. \u274c\n\nSo our safe moves are UP to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,3).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- **UP to (9,4):** Extends our domination on the right wall. From (9,4) we can control more vertical space and potentially box the enemy further. The enemy is at (2,4) \u2014 if they move UP to (2,5), they're still caged by our body. We're keeping the pressure!\n- **LEFT to (8,3):** Moves us toward center, but might open up escape routes for the enemy. Right now they're boxed in by our body at (2,0)-(9,2) and the wall. Moving LEFT could weaken our cage.\n\n**The Play:**\nUP is the move! We maintain our wall dominance, keep the enemy trapped, and position for future aggression. If they're forced to move into our body or into a dead end, they crash and we win! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nKeep the wall! From (9,4), next turn either UP to (9,5) to eat that apple at (5,5) is far, but we can spiral leftward to tighten the cage. Force them into a corner, then when we have a lead, go for the head-on collision for the WIN!\n\n**MOVE:**\nUP",

The board is FIRE\u2014let's box him in and CRASH him out!\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 4) \u2014 We just went UP from (9, 3) to grab an apple! Now we're dominating the top-right corner. \ud83d\udcaa\n- **My Body:** Solid fortress stretching from (2, 0) to (9, 3). We control the entire right wall and bottom-left area.\n- **Opponent:** Head at (1, 4) \u2014 They're sandwiched between our body and the wall! Their body trails to (7, 8), mostly blocking their escape. \ud83d\udc0d\n- **Apple Map:** Plenty of apples, but we're ignoring them to focus on trapping the enemy. Enemy is at (1, 4), apples near (0, 5), (1, 3), etc.\u2014they're hungry but trapped!\n\n**Move Elimination:**\n- **UP (9, 5):** Board shows '.' at (9, 5)? Let's check the grid: Row 5 is \"A . T . . . . A .\" Wait, (9,5) is column 9 of row 5. Row 5: \"A . T . . . . A .\" \u2014 spaces count, (9,5) is '.' (empty). Safe from walls, bodies (my tail is at (2,0) etc., enemy bodies at (2,4) and below, (1,4) is head but we aren't moving there yet). No backward into self. SAFE.\n- **DOWN (9, 3):** DEAD! That's our own body (head was there last turn, now part of body after we grew from apple). \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **LEFT (8, 4):** Check board: Row 4: \"A 1 T . . . . A . 0\" \u2014 columns: 0:A,1:1 (enemy head? Wait, enemy head is (1,4)? Actually, row 4 col1 is '1' which is enemy head at (1,4). (8,4) is '.' \u2014 empty. Safe from walls. Check bodies: My body at (8,0) but that's y=0, not (8,4). Enemy body at (2,4) and below. Not moving into any body. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT (10, 4):** Off board (x=10 invalid) \u2014 DEAD. \u274c\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP and LEFT.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- **UP to (9,5):** Moves us further up the right wall, away from the opponent. We stay at the edge, keeping options open to spiral left later. But we're not tightening the cage on the enemy\u2014they're at (1,4), which is left and down from us. We're gaining height, but maybe not the most aggressive play.\n- **LEFT to (8,4):** This is AGGRESSIVE! We're moving toward the center, closing the distance to the opponent. From (8,4), we're just 7 units away horizontally from their head at (1,4). This puts pressure on them\u2014if they move UP to (1,5), we might corner them against our body at (2,5) and the wall. Also, (8,4) is close to apples at (8,5) and (7,4), but we're prioritizing board control. This move keeps our future options OPEN: from (8,4), we can go UP to (8,5) for an apple, LEFT to (7,4) for another, or DOWN to (8,3) to retreat if needed. It forces the enemy to react\u2014we're boxing them in like a pro! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**The Play:**\nLEFT! Let's close the gap and pressure the rival. If they panic and move into our body (e.g., RIGHT to (2,4)? But (2,4) is their own tail! They might crash themselves) or into a wall, we win. We're at 14 apples, equal score\u2014time to force a head-on collision when we pull ahead. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFrom (8,4), next turn if they stay boxed, spiral LEFT to (7,4) or UP to (8,5) to eat an apple and grow. Keep the cage tight\u2014use our body as walls. Watch their moves: if they try to escape UP, we chase! Goal: trap them between our body and walls, force a crash, then collect apples for the win. If we tie again, we survive to the end and outlast them.\n\n**MOVE:**\nLEFT",

We're one apple behind (14 vs 15) but the board is CRACKING\u2014let's turn this into a WAR!\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- **My Head:** (8, 4) \u2014 We're positioned perfectly to pressure the enemy!\n- **My Body:** Solid fortress from (2,0) to (9,4), controlling the right wall and bottom.\n- **Opponent:** Head at (0, 4) \u2014 They're trapped against the LEFT wall! Their body snakes up to (7,8), blocking their escape routes. They're sandwiched between my body and the wall.\n- **Key Insight:** The enemy is at (0,4) \u2014 if they try to move RIGHT to (1,4), they'll hit THEIR OWN BODY at (1,4) (that's part of their tail). If they move UP to (0,5), that's an apple but it's risky. If they move DOWN to (0,3), that's empty but they'll be cornered. They're PANICKING! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Move Elimination:**\n- **UP (8, 5):** Board shows (8,5) is '.' (empty). Check safety: My body at (8,0) \u2014 far away. Enemy body at (8,8) and (8,9) \u2014 not (8,5). Safe from walls. This is a valid move.\n- **DOWN (8, 3):** Board shows (8,3) is 'T' (tail? Actually row 3: \" . A . . . . . . . T\" \u2014 (8,3) is T, which is MY tail! That's (8,3) = T from my body list? Wait, my body has (8,0), (7,0)... but (8,3) is not in my list. Let's check grid: row 3 col8 is T. That's probably my tail from earlier? Actually my tail is at (3,1). But the T might be enemy? Enemy body has (8,8), (7,8) \u2014 not (8,3). Hmm, but the grid shows T at (8,3), which could be an obstacle. Given the board has T there, we should treat it as occupied. DANGER!\n- **LEFT (7, 4):** Board shows (7,4) is 'A' (apple)! Check safety: My body doesn't have (7,4). Enemy body doesn't have (7,4). Safe from walls. This is AGGRESSIVE and we get an apple!\n- **RIGHT (9, 4):** Board shows (9,4) is 'T' (tail? Row 4: \"... A 0 T\" \u2014 (9,4) is T, which is MY TAIL! That's from my body list: (9,4) is my old head position from last turn, now part of body. Moving into own body = DEAD. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP and LEFT.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- **UP to (8,5):** Safe but passive. We move up the wall, gaining space but not pressuring the enemy. From there, we could eat the apple at (8,5) next turn if available, but we're not closing the cage.\n- **LEFT to (7,4):** AGGRESSIVE KING MOVE! We move toward the center AND eat an apple (+1 point, now 15 apples to tie!). This is CRUCIAL: we need to match their score to keep the pressure on. From (7,4), we're positioned to chase the enemy if they move. If they stay at (0,4), we're now 7 cells closer horizontally. Also, (7,4) is near other apples at (7,3?) and (8,5) for future growth. This keeps our options OPEN: we can spiral left or up next.\n\n**The Play:**\nLEFT! Eat that apple, tie the score at 15-15, and close the distance! The enemy is trapped\u2014if they move RIGHT into their own body, they crash. If they move UP/DOWN, we can chase and box them further. We're being RUTHLESS and taking the board! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFrom (7,4), next turn if enemy moves UP to (0,5), we can move LEFT to (6,4) or UP to (7,5) to cut off escape. Use our body as a wall\u2014squeeze them against the left side. If we can force a head-on collision when we're tied or ahead, we win. Focus on apples only to grow and dominate, but prioritize trapping them. If they die first, we win instantly. Let's go CHAT! \ud83d\udc80\n\nMOVE: LEFT",

Let's break this down LIVE!\n\n---\n\n### **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**\n\n**My Snake (ID 0):**\n- **Head:** (7, 4) \u2014 just moved here, eating an apple!\n- **Body:** Long fortress from (8,4) back to (3,1). I'm basically a wall on the right side of the board.\n- **Apples:** 15 \u2014 TIED with the opponent if I can get another apple this turn!\n\n**Opponent Snake #1:**\n- **Head:** (0, 5) \u2014 trapped against the left wall, same as last turn.\n- **Body:** [(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8)]\n  - **CRITICAL OBSERVATION:** Their body starts at (0,4) and goes up the left wall, then across the top, then down the right side. This means if they try to move RIGHT from (0,5) to (1,5), they'll hit THEIR OWN BODY at (1,4)? Wait, (1,5) is empty? Let's check...\n  - From (0,5), they can move DOWN to (0,4) but that's their own tail (will move, but they'd be moving into the cell their tail just left? Actually simultaneous move\u2014need to be careful. If they move DOWN, their tail moves away, but they'd be moving into where their tail was. That's safe as long as it's not occupied after all moves. However, (0,4) is currently occupied by their body, but it's the second segment. Since all snakes move simultaneously, if they move DOWN, the tail moves first? No\u2014simultaneous. The new head position must be safe after all movements. We need to consider that (0,4) will be vacated if their tail moves, but other segments shift. This is tricky. Safer to assume they avoid moving into their own body unless it's the tail.\n\n**Board State (10x10):**\n- I've mapped it out\u2014there are apples at (5,6), (4,0), (8,5), (1,0), (3,8), (1,3), (3,7), (8,7), (0,6), (0,8), (9,7), (5,5), (0,0), (6,6), (3,5). Many are accessible!\n- **Key Locations:**\n  - My head at (7,4)\n  - Opponent head at (0,5)\n  - My body dominates right side: (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)\n  - Opponent body runs along left and top walls: (0,4) to (8,9)\n  - Apples: (8,5) is near me\u2014just above my old position? Actually (8,5) is above (8,4) which was my head last turn. (8,5) is currently '.' per board? Let's verify: Board row 5: \"5 1 . T A . A . . A .\" \u2014 (8,5) is '.'? Wait, row 5: col 0:1 (snake head), col1:., col2:T (enemy body?), col3:A, col4:., col5:A, col6:., col7:., col8:A, col9:.. Actually (8,5) is column 8, row 5? Wait, coordinates: (x,y) with x horizontal, y vertical. Board shows rows from y=9 top to y=0 bottom. So row 5 corresponds to y=5. Columns from x=0 to 9. So (8,5) is at x=8, y=5. Looking at row 5 string: \"1 . T A . A . . A .\" Let's index: x=0: '1' (opp head), x=1: '.', x=2: 'T' (opp body), x=3: 'A', x=4: '.', x=5: 'A', x=6: '.', x=7: '.', x=8: 'A', x=9: '.'. So (8,5) is 'A'! There's an apple at (8,5). But earlier I thought it was empty? Actually my last turn I considered (8,5) as empty because I was at (8,4) and looked at board? Let's check board row 4: \"T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" \u2014 at y=4, x=8 is 'T'? Wait row 4: \"T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" \u2014 that's x=0:T, x=1:T, x=2:T, x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:0, x=9:T. So at turn 34 when I was at (8,4), (8,5) was above and was '.'? Actually board row 5 was \"5 1 . T A . A . . A .\" but that's from turn 35? I'm confused. The board state shown is CURRENT (after my move to (7,4)? Actually the board shows '0' at (7,4)? Let's check row 4: \"T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" \u2014 that's x=8? Wait row 4: positions: x=0:T, x=1:T, x=2:T, x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:0, x=9:T. So my head is at (8,4)? But the description says my head is (7,4). There's a discrepancy. Let's re-read the prompt.\n\nThe prompt says: \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (7, 4)\" and the board shows row 4 has '0' at x=8? That can't be. Actually row 4: \"T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" \u2014 the '0' is at the eighth character? Let's count: T (0), T (1), T (2), . (3), . (4), . (5), . (6), . (7), 0 (8), T (9). So (8,4) is '0'. But the snake description says head is (7,4). This is inconsistent. Perhaps the board representation is different? Maybe the '0' is at (7,4) if we consider the string starting at x=0? Let's assume the board matches the snake head. The snake head is at (7,4), so on the board, (7,4) should be '0'. Looking at row 4: \"T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" \u2014 if we index from 0: x=0:T, x=1:T, x=2:T, x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:0, x=9:T. So (7,4) is '.' and (8,4) is '0'. But the snake head is (7,4). So the board might be from before my move? Wait, the board is given as \"BOARD STATE:\" and it's labeled Turn 35, after my move? The prompt says \"Turn: 35 / 150\" and gives the board. It also says \"YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP):\" and shows I moved LEFT. So the board should reflect the state after my move. But then my head should be at (7,4). So the board must be showing (7,4) as '0'. But the string shows '0' at the 9th character (index 8). Unless the coordinates are reversed? The prompt says \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\" And the board shows rows from top (y=9) to bottom (y=0). So row y=4 is the 6th row from top? Let's list rows:\n\nRow 9: \"9 . . T T T T T T T .\" \u2192 y=9\nRow 8: \"8 A . T A . . . T T .\" \u2192 y=8\nRow 7: \". . T A . . . . A A\" \u2192 y=7\nRow 6: \"6 A . T . . A A . . .\" \u2192 y=6\nRow 5: \"5 1 . T A . A . . A .\" \u2192 y=5\nRow 4: \"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" \u2192 y=4\nRow 3: \"3 . A . . . . . . . T\" \u2192 y=3\nRow 2: \"2 . . . . T T T . . T\" \u2192 y=2\nRow 1: \"1 . . . T T . T . . T\" \u2192 y=1\nRow 0: \"0 A A . . A . T T T T\" \u2192 y=0\n\nSo at y=4, the row is \"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\". This means for x from 0 to 9: x=0:T, x=1:T, x=2:T, x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:0, x=9:T. So (8,4) is '0', (7,4) is '.'. But the snake head is listed as (7,4). There's a conflict. Possibly the snake head is actually at (8,4) but the description says (7,4)? Or maybe the board is from before the move? The last move was LEFT, which from (8,4) to (7,4). So before the move, head was (8,4), after move head is (7,4). The board shows head at (8,4)? That would be before the move. But the turn is 35, and we just moved, so board should be after move. This is confusing.\n\nI need to resolve this. Looking at the opponent: head at (0,5). Board row 5: \"5 1 . T A . A . . A .\" \u2192 x=0:'1', so (0,5) is '1', good. My body: listed as [(8,4), (9,4), (9,3), ...]. So my old head was (8,4), now it's part of body. After moving LEFT, new head is (7,4). So the board should show '0' at (7,4), not (8,4). But the board shows '0' at (8,4). So perhaps the board is not updated? Or the coordinates are different? Maybe the board shows the state at the start of turn 35? That would make sense: at start of turn 35, my head is at (8,4), and I'm about to move. But the prompt says \"Turn: 35 / 150\" and gives the board, and then talks about my last move (which was from turn 34 to turn 35). So the board is likely the state BEFORE my move? But then it says \"YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP):\" and shows LEFT. So if I moved LEFT from (8,4) to (7,4), the board before move had head at (8,4). So the board showing '0' at (8,4) matches that. Therefore, the board is the state at the beginning of turn 35, before my move? But the turn is 35, and we are about to make a move for turn 35? Actually, the game says \"Turn: 35 / 150\" and gives the board and then my last move? Wait, the sequence: they show the board for turn 35, then they show my last move from turn 34 to turn 35? That is confusing.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Turn: 35 / 150\" then \"APPLE DROPS:\" then \"SCOREBOARD:\" then \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):\" with head (7,4) and body including (8,4) as first body segment. So at turn 35, my head is (7,4). The board must reflect that. But the board shows '0' at (8,4). So there's an error in the board representation? Perhaps the board is not showing the head correctly? Or maybe the '0' is at (7,4) but the string is misaligned? Let's look at row 4: \"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\". There are 10 characters after \"4 \"? Actually the string: \"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" - that's 11 characters? Let's count: T, space, T, space, T, space, ., space, ., space, ., space, ., space, ., space, 0, space, T, space, T. That's 20 characters? Actually it's easier: the board is shown with spaces between each cell? No, looking at the board: \"9 . . T T T T T T T .\" that's 10 characters separated by spaces? Actually it's: \"9 . . T T T T T T T .\" That's 11 tokens including the row number. So after the row number, there are 10 tokens for x=0 to 9. So for row 4: tokens are: T, ., T, T, T, ., ., ., ., 0, T, T? That's 12 tokens? I think there's a mistake. Let's copy the row 4 exactly: \"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" \u2013 if we split by spaces: [\"4\", \"T\", \"T\", \"T\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \"0\", \"T\", \"T\"] -> that's 12 elements. So x=0 to 9 should be 10 elements. So maybe there's an extra T at the beginning? Actually from the pattern: row 0: \"0 A A . . A . T T T T\" -> tokens: 0, A, A, ., ., A, ., T, T, T, T -> that's 11 tokens. So row number plus 10 cells. So row 0 has 10 cells: A, A, ., ., A, ., T, T, T, T. So x=0:A, x=1:A, x=2:., x=3:., x=4:A, x=5:., x=6:T, x=7:T, x=8:T, x=9:T. That matches.\n\nRow 4: \"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" -> after \"4\", tokens: T, T, T, ., ., ., ., ., 0, T, T -> that's 11 tokens, so 10 cells? Actually 11 tokens means 10 cells? Wait, if there are 11 tokens including the row number, then there are 10 cells. But here we have 12 tokens? Let's count properly: \n\"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" \nSplitting by spaces: \n1: \"4\"\n2: \"T\"\n3: \"T\"\n4: \"T\"\n5: \".\"\n6: \".\"\n7: \".\"\n8: \".\"\n9: \".\"\n10: \"0\"\n11: \"T\"\n12: \"T\"\nThat's 12 tokens. So it's inconsistent. Possibly there's an extra space or missing cell. Maybe the board is formatted with single spaces, and the row string is \"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" which has 10 cells? Let's list without assuming: \nPosition: after \"4\", first cell is \"T\", second is \"T\", third is \"T\", fourth is \".\", fifth is \".\", sixth is \".\", seventh is \".\", eighth is \".\", ninth is \"0\", tenth is \"T\". Then there's an extra \"T\"? Actually the string ends with \" T T\", so maybe the tenth cell is \"T\" and the ninth is \"0\", and the extra \"T\" is a typo? Or maybe the board has 11 cells per row? Unlikely.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll rely on the snake data: my head is at (7,4) after my last move (LEFT). So for the current turn (turn 35), my head is at (7,4). The opponent's head is at (0,5). The body lists are given. I'll use that.\n\n---\n\n### **MOVE CONSIDERATION FOR TURN 35**\n\nFrom (7,4), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n1. **UP to (7,5):** Check board: row 5 y=5, x=7. Board row 5: \"5 1 . T A . A . . A .\" So at x=7, it's '.'? Let's see: tokens: 1, ., T, A, ., A, ., ., A, . (10 cells). So x=0:1, x=1:., x=2:T, x=3:A, x=4:., x=5:A, x=6:., x=7:., x=8:A, x=9:.. So (7,5) is '.' (empty). Is it safe? Check my body: my body includes (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). So (7,5) is not in my body. Check opponent body: (0,4),(1,4),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,9),(4,9),(5,9),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(8,8),(7,8). So (7,5) is not in opponent body. Also not off board. So UP is safe.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7,3):** Board row 3: \"3 . A . . . . . . . T\" -> cells: x=0:., x=1:A, x=2:., x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:., x=9:T. So (7,3) is '.' (empty). Check my body: not there. Opponent body: not there. Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6,4):** Board row 4: we need to figure row 4 cells. From earlier, row 4 likely: x=0:T, x=1:T, x=2:T, x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:? (maybe 0), x=9:T. But from snake data, my head was at (8,4) before move, and I moved to (7,4), so (6,4) should be empty. Let's check opponent body: (6,4) is not in opponent list (opponent has (6,9), (7,9), etc., but not (6,4)). My body: (6,4) is not in my body list. So likely safe. But need to confirm board: row 4 string \"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" -> if we interpret as cells: T, T, T, ., ., ., ., ., 0, T? That would give x=0:T, x=1:T, x=2:T, x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:0, x=9:T. So (6,4) is '.' (since x=6 is '.'). So safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8,4):** But (8,4) is now part of my body (first body segment after head). Moving into own body = death. Also, from board, (8,4) is likely 'T' or something? Actually if my head moved from (8,4) to (7,4), then (8,4) is now the first body segment. So moving RIGHT would crash into myself. NOT SAFE. Eliminate.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, which move to choose? We want to be aggressive and force a win. We are one apple behind. We need to eat apples to tie or overtake. Also, we want to trap the opponent.\n\n**Consider the apples reachable from (7,4):**\n- (8,5): apple, from (7,4) that's UP-RIGHT, not directly reachable in one move. But if we go UP to (7,5), then next move could go RIGHT to (8,5). \n- (7,3) is empty, but (7,3) is near apples? (6,6) is apple, but that's far. (5,5) is apple, etc.\n- (6,4): from here, we could go to (6,5) or (5,4), etc. There's an apple at (5,5) and (6,6).\n- (7,5): from here, we can go to (7,6) or (8,5) (apple). Also (7,5) is close to opponent's area? Opponent is far left.\n\nBut we also need to think about the opponent's move. The opponent is at (0,5). What can they do?\n- They are trapped against left wall. Possible moves: \n  - UP to (0,6): Check board row 6: \"6 A . T . . A A . . .\" -> (0,6) is 'A' (apple). But is it safe? Their body: (0,4) is part of their body. If they move UP, the tail moves away, so (0,6) might be empty after movement? But we must consider simultaneous moves. (0,6) currently has an apple and is not occupied by any body? Check opponent body: (0,4) is the second segment, not (0,6). My body: not there. So likely safe. \n  - DOWN to (0,4): But (0,4) is currently occupied by their own body (second segment). If they move DOWN, they'd be moving into their own body? Actually (0,4) is occupied by their body at start of turn. If they move DOWN, their tail moves away, but the head would move into (0,4), which is currently occupied by the second segment. Since all segments move simultaneously, the second segment will move to (0,3) if the head moves DOWN? Not necessarily\u2014the entire body shifts. Actually, when a snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment takes the place of the previous one. So if the head moves from (0,5) to (0,4), the body segments shift: the old head becomes the new first body segment at (0,5), the old first body segment (0,4) becomes the second body segment at (0,4)? That would mean the head moves into the cell that is currently occupied by the first body segment, but that segment will move away to (0,5) (the old head). So actually, it's safe to move into (0,4) because that segment will move to the head's old position. However, the rule says: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" But if it's your own body, and that body segment is moving away, is it still considered an occupied cell at the time of movement? The standard Snake game rules usually allow moving into the segment that is about to move away, as long as it's not the tail? Actually, in many implementations, moving into your own body (except the tail) causes death because the body doesn't move instantly. But in simultaneous movement, it's tricky. The prompt says: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" That suggests that if the head moves into a cell that is currently occupied by any body segment (including your own), you die. So if the opponent moves DOWN to (0,4), which is currently occupied by their own body (the first body segment), they would die. Therefore, they likely won't move DOWN. \n  - RIGHT to (1,5): Check board row 5: (1,5) is '.' (empty). But is it safe from their own body? Their body has (1,4) and (2,4), etc. (1,5) is not in their body list. So moving RIGHT might be safe. However, (1,5) is currently empty. But we need to consider if my body is there? No. So RIGHT is a possible move.\n- They might also consider moving to (0,6) which is an apple, so likely they'll go for that to increase score.\n\nIf the opponent goes UP to (0,6) and eats an apple, they'll grow to 17 apples, increasing their lead. We need to eat an apple to tie or overtake.\n\n**Which move gives me an apple immediately?**\n- From (7,4), if I go UP to (7,5), I don't get an apple ( (7,5) is empty).\n- If I go DOWN to (7,3), no apple.\n- If I go LEFT to (6,4), no apple.\n- No move directly gives an apple. So I need to plan to get an apple next turn.\n\nBut there are apples nearby: (8,5) is apple at x=8,y=5. To reach it, I could:\n- Go UP to (7,5) now, then next turn RIGHT to (8,5) to eat.\n- Or go RIGHT to (8,4) but that's suicide (own body).\n- Or go UP-LEFT? Not directly.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (7,3)? No, (7,3) is empty. (6,6) is apple, but that's two moves away: LEFT to (6,4), then UP to (6,5), then UP to (6,6) \u2014 but (6,5) is empty? Check board row 5: (6,5) is '.'? Row 5: x=6 is '.'? From earlier: row 5 tokens: 1, ., T, A, ., A, ., ., A, . so x=6 is '.' (since after x=5:A, x=6:.). So (6,5) is empty. So I could go LEFT to (6,4), then UP to (6,5), then UP to (6,6) to eat apple. But that takes two turns.\n\nAnother apple: (5,5) is apple at x=5,y=5. From (7,4), I could go LEFT to (6,4), then LEFT to (5,4) (empty? row 4 x=5 is '.'), then UP to (5,5). Or from (6,4) directly UP to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5). But (5,5) is apple, so after reaching (5,5) I eat it.\n\nBut we need to think about the opponent. If I don't eat an apple now, they might eat one and extend their lead.\n\n**What about the apple at (8,5)?** That's the closest apple to me. From (7,4), I can't reach it in one move. But if I go UP to (7,5), then next turn I can go RIGHT to (8,5) and eat it. However, is (8,5) still safe? It might be contested. The opponent is far away, so likely safe. But we must consider that the opponent might also move toward that area? Unlikely, they are on the left.\n\n**What about the apple at (6,6)?** From (7,4), I could go LEFT to (6,4), then next turn UP to (6,5), then next turn UP to (6,6). That's two turns to get the apple. Meanwhile, opponent might eat an apple in one turn.\n\n**Apple at (5,5):** Similar, two turns.\n\n**Apple at (7,3)?** Not an apple.\n\n**Apple at (8,7)?** That's far.\n\nSo the fastest apple for me is (8,5) by going UP next, then RIGHT. But I need to secure that path.\n\nNow, what about the opponent's potential moves? If I move UP to (7,5), what might the opponent do? They might go UP to (0,6) to eat that apple, increasing their lead to 17. Then I'm further behind. If I move LEFT to (6,4), they might still go UP to (0,6). So regardless, if they eat an apple, they'll be at 17, and I'll be at 15. Then I need to eat two apples quickly to catch up.\n\nBut maybe I can force a confrontation. If I move LEFT to (6,4), I'm moving toward the center-left, potentially cutting off their escape routes. However, they are far left, so not immediately threatening.\n\nAlternatively, I could move UP to (7,5) to position for the apple at (8,5). From there, I also have options to move LEFT, DOWN, or UP next turn.\n\n**Safety considerations:** \n- Moving UP to (7,5): check if it's safe from opponent's potential head movement? The opponent could theoretically move right and eventually come toward me, but not this turn.\n- Moving DOWN to (7,3): also safe.\n- Moving LEFT to (6,4): also safe.\n\nBut we need to think about future trapping. The opponent is confined to the left wall. If I move LEFT, I'm moving toward them, possibly boxing them in further. If I move UP, I'm moving away from them, giving them more space on the left? Actually, they are already against the wall; moving UP or LEFT doesn't affect their immediate space.\n\n**Long-term strategy:** We want to force a head-on collision when we have a higher score. Currently, we are tied? No, they have 16, we have 15. So we need to tie or overtake. Once we have more apples, we can force a collision to win. But we must be careful not to die.\n\nGiven the board is 10x10 and we are at turn 35/150, we have time. But we need to close the apple gap.\n\n**Best move:** I think moving LEFT to (6,4) is strong because:\n- It moves me toward the center-left area, where there are apples like (5,5), (6,6), and even (3,5), (3,7), etc.\n- It also puts pressure on the opponent if they ever try to move right. From (6,4), I can later move LEFT to (5,4), etc., effectively building a wall that limits their space.\n- From (6,4), next turn I can go UP to (6,5) (empty) and then to (6,6) for an apple, or go LEFT to (5,4) then UP to (5,5) for an apple.\n- Also, (6,4) is safe from immediate collision.\n\nIf I move UP to (7,5), I'm committing to the right side, but there's an apple at (8,5) nearby. However, I might get trapped in the top-right corner if I keep going up. My body is already long along the right wall, so going UP might lead to a dead end later.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,3), I'm moving toward the bottom-left, but there's an apple at (6,6) or (5,5) that requires going up later.\n\n**Check for potential head-on collision this turn:** Since we are at (7,4) and opponent at (0,5), there's no risk of head-on collision this turn unless the opponent moves toward me, which is unlikely.\n\n**Decision:** I'll go LEFT to (6,4) to position for attacking the left side and go for apples in the central area. This also helps in boxing the opponent if they ever move right.\n\n**Long-term plan:** From (6,4), next turn go UP to (6,5) to get closer to apple at (6,6). If the opponent moves UP to (0,6) and eats an apple, we need to eat two apples quickly. We'll prioritize apples at (6,6) and (5,5). Once we tie or overtake, we can force a collision.\n\n**Final move:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

We just moved LEFT to (7,4), and now we're positioned to dominate the board.\n\n### **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**\n\n**My Snake (ID 0):**\n- **Head:** (7,4)\n- **Body:** [(8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)]\n- **Apples:** 15\n\n**Opponent Snake #1:**\n- **Head:** (0,6)\n- **Body:** [(0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8)]\n- **Apples:** 17\n\n**Board State (10x10):**\n- **Apple at (6,6)** \u2014 directly north of us, but we need to path there carefully.\n- **Apple at (5,5)** \u2014 northwest, slightly safer path.\n- **Apple at (5,6)** \u2014 west-northwest, but blocked by my body? Not really.\n- **Apple at (6,5)** \u2014 empty? Actually (6,5) is empty (based on board row 5: \"5 1 . T A . A . . A .\" -> (6,5) is '.').\n- **Apple at (5,5)** \u2014 row 5, col 5: 'A'? Wait, row 5: \"1 . T A . A . . A .\" -> x=0:1, x=1:., x=2:T, x=3:A, x=4:., x=5:A, x=6:., x=7:., x=8:A, x=9:.. So (5,5) is 'A' (apple). Good.\n- **Apple at (6,6)** \u2014 row 6: \"6 A . T . . A A . . .\" -> x=6: 'A'? Actually x=0:A, x=1:., x=2:T, x=3:., x=4:., x=5:A, x=6:A, x=7:., x=8:., x=9:.. So (6,6) is 'A' (apple). Good.\n\n**Potential Moves from (7,4):**\n\n**1. UP to (7,5):**\n- (7,5) is currently '.' (empty). However, from row 5: x=7 is '.'? Actually row 5: \"1 . T A . A . . A .\" -> x=7 is '.'? Wait indexing: x=0:1, x=1:., x=2:T, x=3:A, x=4:., x=5:A, x=6:., x=7:., x=8:A, x=9:.. So (7,5) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- **BUT:** (7,5) is near my body at (7,4)? That's fine. But if I go UP, I might be getting closer to the top wall. My body is along the right wall (x=9). This could lead to a dead end if I keep going up and the opponent cuts off the left side.\n- **Future options:** From (7,5), I could go UP to (7,6) (empty), LEFT to (6,5) (empty), RIGHT to (8,5) (apple! (8,5) is 'A'), or DOWN back to (7,4). So multiple options.\n- **Risk:** The opponent might move RIGHT from (0,6) to (1,6) or UP to (0,7). Not immediate threat.\n\n**2. DOWN to (7,3):**\n- (7,3) is currently '.'? Row 3: \"3 . A . . . . . . . T\" -> x=7 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- **BUT:** Moving down takes us away from the central apples and toward the bottom-right corner. Our body is already along the bottom (y=0). This could trap us if we go too far down.\n- **Future options:** From (7,3), we could go LEFT to (6,3) (empty? row 3: x=6 is '.'), UP back to (7,4), DOWN to (7,2) (empty? row 2: x=7 is '.'), or RIGHT to (8,3) (empty? row 3: x=8 is '.'? row 3: x=8 is '.'? Actually row 3: \"3 . A . . . . . . . T\" -> x=8 is '.'? Let's count: x=0:., x=1:A, x=2:., x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:., x=9:T. So (7,3) is x=7,y=3? Wait row 3 is y=3. So (7,3) is '.' and (8,3) is '.'? Actually x=8 is '.'? The string has '.' at position 8? The string: \". A . . . . . . . T\" \u2014 there are 10 characters: index 0:'.', 1:'A', 2:'.', 3:'.', 4:'.', 5:'.', 6:'.', 7:'.', 8:'.', 9:'T'. So (8,3) is '.'. So right is empty. But (9,3) is 'T' (my body). So RIGHT is safe.\n- However, moving down is not directly toward any apple. Apples are at (6,6), (5,5), etc., which require moving up eventually.\n\n**3. LEFT to (6,4):**\n- (6,4) is currently '.'? Row 4: \"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" -> x=6 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- **Advantage:** Moves us toward the center-left, where apples are abundant. From (6,4), we can go UP to (6,5) (empty), LEFT to (5,4) (empty), or DOWN to (6,3) (empty). RIGHT back to (7,4) is also safe (but that's backtracking).\n- **Apple access:** From (6,4), next turn we can go UP to (6,5) (empty), then UP to (6,6) to eat the apple. Alternatively, LEFT to (5,4) then UP to (5,5) for an apple.\n- **Strategic:** This positions us to cut off the opponent's potential expansion. If they ever try to move right, we can block. Also, we can box them in the left-top corner.\n- **Safety:** (6,4) is not near any immediate threats. Our own body is mostly at x=6+ (right side). So moving left doesn't cause self-collision.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (8,4):**\n- (8,4) is currently occupied by our own body (the first segment). That's a self-collision! **DEAD ON MOVE.** So RIGHT is **ILLEGAL**.\n\n### **ELIMINATE MOVES**\n- **RIGHT:** immediate death (into own body). ELIMINATED.\n- **DOWN:** safe but moves away from apples and into potential dead end. Not optimal for apple collection.\n- **UP:** safe and moves toward apples, but might commit us to the right side where space is limited by our body.\n- **LEFT:** safe, moves toward apples, and keeps options open. Also, we can transition to attack the left side.\n\n### **BEST MOVE**\n**LEFT to (6,4)** is the strongest choice. Why?\n- **Apple proximity:** Leads directly to apple at (6,6) or (5,5). We need apples to tie the score.\n- **Safety:** No immediate threats. The opponent is far left, and our body is not in the way.\n- **Future options:** From (6,4), we have multiple safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT).\n- **Long-term strategy:** We can start building a wall from the right side moving leftward, eventually boxing the opponent in the left corner. With our length, we can control the board.\n\n**Quick head-on collision check:** The opponent is at (0,6). We're at (7,4). If they move RIGHT to (1,6) and we move LEFT to (6,4), no collision. If they move UP to (0,7), no issue. So safe.\n\n### **LONG-TERM PLAN**\nFrom (6,4), next turn we'll go UP to (6,5) to get closer to the apple at (6,6). After eating that apple (turn 37), we'll have 16 apples, tying the opponent. Then we'll aim for (5,5) or another apple to overtake. Once we have more apples, we can force a head-on collision by chasing the opponent into a corner. We'll keep our body long to restrict their movement.\n\n**Final move:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

The opponent is still stuck on the left side, and we're positioned to dominate the board. We moved LEFT last turn to (6,4), and now we have some solid options.\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (6,4). Body: [(7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1)] (length 16). 15 apples.\n- **Opponent Snake #1:** Head at (0,7). Body: [(0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8)] (length 18). 17 apples. They're moving around the top-left corner.\n- **Apples:** Key ones near us: (6,6) directly north (2 steps away), (5,5) northwest (2 steps away), (5,6) west-northwest, (8,5) east (but our body is east, so maybe not). Also (3,5), (4,3), etc., but those are farther.\n\n**POTENTIAL MOVES FROM (6,4):**\n\n**1. UP to (6,5):**\n- (6,5) is currently empty (from board row 5: \"1 . T A . A . . A .\" -> x=6 is '.'). Safe.\n- **BUT:** (6,5) is adjacent to my own body at (6,4) but that's fine. However, if I go UP, I'm moving closer to the opponent's territory. The opponent could potentially move RIGHT to (1,7) or something, but no immediate threat.\n- **Future options:** From (6,5), I can go UP to (6,6) (apple!), LEFT to (5,5) (apple!), RIGHT to (7,5) (empty), DOWN back to (6,4). Multiple safe paths.\n- **Strategic:** This directly advances toward apples. Eating (6,6) or (5,5) would tie us at 16 apples. Excellent for closing the gap.\n\n**2. DOWN to (6,3):**\n- (6,3) is currently empty (row 3: \"3 . A . . . . . . . T\" -> x=6 is '.'). Safe.\n- **BUT:** Moving down takes us away from apples and toward the bottom where our body is dense. This could limit our escape routes. The bottom row (y=0) is packed with our body.\n- **Future options:** From (6,3), I can go UP to (6,4), LEFT to (5,3) (empty? row 3: x=5 is '.'), RIGHT to (7,3) (empty), DOWN to (6,2) (empty? row 2: x=6 is '.'? Actually row 2: \"2 . . . . T T T . . T\" -> x=6 is 'T' (our body)). So DOWN is into our own body (tail end) \u2013 that would be death if we go down from (6,3) to (6,2)? Wait, (6,2) is part of our body? Let's check: My body includes (6,2) earlier in the list. Yes, (6,2) is in our body. So if we go DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2), that's moving into our own body \u2013 immediate death! So DOWN is actually risky because the cell below (6,3) is (6,2), which is occupied by our body. Eliminate DOWN.\n- **Correction:** (6,2) is in our body list, so moving DOWN from (6,4) to (6,3) is safe, but from (6,3), moving DOWN to (6,2) would be bad. But for this turn, moving DOWN to (6,3) is safe because (6,3) is empty. However, it's not optimal.\n\n**3. LEFT to (5,4):**\n- (5,4) is currently empty (row 4: \"4 T T T . . . . . 0 T T\" -> x=5 is '.'). Safe.\n- **Advantage:** Moves us further left, toward apples at (5,5) and (5,6). Also, we can go UP to (5,5) next turn for an apple.\n- **Future options:** From (5,4), I can go UP to (5,5) (apple!), LEFT to (4,4) (empty? row 4: x=4 is '.'), DOWN to (5,3) (empty), RIGHT back to (6,4). Multiple options.\n- **Strategic:** Good for controlling the center-left. The opponent is at x=0, so we're getting closer to their side, which could help in boxing them in later.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (7,4):**\n- (7,4) is occupied by our own body (the first segment after head). That's self-collision! **DEAD ON MOVE.** ILLEGAL.\n\n**ELIMINATE MOVES:**\n- **RIGHT:** immediate death (into own body). ELIMINATED.\n- **DOWN:** safe for this turn (to (6,3)), but it moves us away from apples and toward a crowded area. Not ideal. However, it's not immediately lethal, but we'll prefer UP or LEFT.\n- **UP and LEFT:** Both safe and move toward apples.\n\n**BEST MOVE:**\n**UP to (6,5)** is the top choice. Why?\n- **Apple proximity:** It gets us closer to (6,6) and (5,5). From (6,5), we can eat (6,6) next turn if we go UP, or (5,5) if we go LEFT. Both are reachable.\n- **Safety:** No immediate threats from the opponent (they're at (0,7), far away). Our body isn't in the way. From (6,5), we have multiple escape routes.\n- **Aggression:** We need apples to catch up. This move sets us up for a quick apple grab to tie the score. Once tied, we can start planning head-on collisions with our higher score (since we'll grow faster).\n- **Long-term:** We're building a wall from the right side, and moving UP keeps us in the central area where apples are dropping. The opponent is trapped in the top-left; we can keep expanding our territory.\n\n**Check for head-on collision:** If the opponent moves RIGHT to (1,7) and we move UP to (6,5), no collision. If they move UP to (0,8), still no issue. We're safe.\n\n**Strategy note for future self:** From (6,5), next turn go UP to (6,6) for the apple. That'll tie us at 16 apples. Then, we can chase the opponent down. If they keep running, we'll use our length to cut off their escape routes. Remember, if we have more apples, force a head-on collision in an open area\u2014don't chase into corners where we might trap ourselves. Keep the board controlled.\n\nLet's eat! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**YO WHAT'S UP CHAT!** Turn 38, let's keep this grind going! \ud83d\udd25 We're down 16 to 18 apples, but we're in a strong position to close that gap. The opponent is still chilling on the left side, and we're ready to make moves. We moved UP last turn to (5,5), grabbed that apple, and now we're at (5,5) with a body that's solid. Time to push forward!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (5,5). Body: [(6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)] (length 17). 16 apples (just ate one!).  \n- **Opponent Snake #1:** Head at (0,8). Body: [(0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8)] (length 18). 18 apples. They're still on the left-top, looping around.  \n- **Apples:** Key ones: (6,6) north of us (1 step away), (5,6) northeast (1 step away), (4,5) west? Wait, (4,5) isn't listed, but we have (3,5), (4,3), etc. (8,5) is east but our body blocks that direction. We're in a great spot to grab (6,6) or (5,6) next turn.\n\n**POTENTIAL MOVES FROM (5,5):**\n\n**1. UP to (5,6):**\n- (5,6) is empty (from board row 6: \"T . T A . A A . . .\" -> x=5 is '.'). Safe.\n- **BUT:** Moving UP takes us right next to the apple at (6,6) as well. From (5,6), I can go RIGHT to (6,6) (apple!), DOWN back to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6) (empty? row 6: x=4 is 'A' \u2013 that's an apple! So (4,6) has an apple too? Wait, (4,6) is an apple drop? Let's check apple list: (4,0), (4,3), but (4,6) isn't listed. Actually row 6: \"T . T A . A A . . .\" \u2013 positions: x=3 is 'A', x=5 is '.', x=6 is 'A'. So (4,6) is '.'? Row 6 has apples at (3,6), (5,6)? No, (5,6) is not an apple from the list, but (6,6) is an apple. From (5,6), RIGHT to (6,6) is an apple \u2013 that's a guaranteed eat next turn!\n- **Future options:** From (5,6), multiple moves: UP to (5,7) (empty? row 7: x=5 is '.'), RIGHT to (6,6) (apple!), DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6) (empty). Great escape routes.\n- **Strategic:** We're positioning to eat (6,6) immediately next turn. Also, the opponent is at (0,8), far away \u2013 no head-on threat this turn. We keep expanding our territory toward the top-center, where apples are abundant.\n\n**2. DOWN to (5,4):**\n- (5,4) is empty (row 4: \"T T T . . . . . T T\" -> x=5 is '.'). Safe.\n- **BUT:** Moving DOWN takes us away from apples and toward our own body at (6,4) and below. This limits future options and moves us south where our tail is thick.\n- **Future options:** From (5,4), I can go UP to (5,5), LEFT to (4,4) (empty), RIGHT to (6,4) (occupied by our body \u2013 death if we go there!). So only LEFT or UP are safe. That's a dead-end trap. Avoid.\n- **Strategic:** Not optimal. We need to chase apples, not retreat.\n\n**3. LEFT to (4,5):**\n- (4,5) is empty? Row 5: \"1 . T A . A . . A .\" -> x=4 is '.' (between the '1' at x=0 and 'T' at x=2). Safe.\n- **Advantage:** Moves us left toward apples at (3,5) and (4,3). Also, from (4,5), I can go UP to (4,6) (empty), DOWN to (4,4) (empty), LEFT to (3,5) (apple!).\n- **Future options:** Multiple: UP, DOWN, LEFT (apple!), RIGHT back to (5,5). Good control.\n- **Strategic:** Gets us closer to the opponent's side? They're at x=0, but we're still safe distance. Good for boxing them in later if we keep moving left. However, (6,6) is more immediate and we're already on path to it.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (6,5):**\n- (6,5) is occupied by our own body (the segment after head). That's self-collision! **DEAD ON MOVE.** ILLEGAL.\n\n**ELIMINATE MOVES:**\n- **RIGHT:** immediate death (into own body). ELIMINATED.\n- **DOWN:** safe for this turn, but moves us into a tighter space with limited follow-up moves. ELIMINATED due to trap risk.\n- **UP and LEFT:** Both safe and move toward apples.\n\n**BEST MOVE:**\n**UP to (5,6)** is the top choice. Why?\n- **Apple proximity:** It sets us up perfectly to eat (6,6) next turn by going RIGHT. That would tie our score at 17 apples (we have 16 now, +1 for apple = 17, but wait: we already ate this turn? Actually, we moved UP to (5,5) last turn and ate an apple, so our score is 16. From (5,6), if we go RIGHT to (6,6) next turn, we eat another apple, making it 17. Still trailing by 1, but closing the gap fast.\n- **Safety:** No immediate threats. Opponent is at (0,8), moving away from us. Our body isn't blocking the way. From (5,6), we have multiple escape routes (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT to apple). No head-on collision risk this turn \u2013 opponent likely moves UP or RIGHT, but we're far apart.\n- **Aggression:** We need apples to catch up. This move keeps us in the central area where apples drop frequently. Once we tie or lead, we can start forcing head-on collisions. Remember, if we have more apples, we win collisions \u2013 so let's get that apple!\n- **Long-term:** We're building a wall from the right, but moving UP keeps us flexible. The opponent is trapped in the top-left; we can cut off their escape by controlling the center. Plan: From (5,6), next turn RIGHT to (6,6) for the apple. Then from (6,6), options open to chase opponent if needed.\n\n**Check for head-on collision:** If opponent moves RIGHT to (1,8) and we move UP to (5,6), no collision. If they move UP to (0,9), still no issue. We're safe.\n\n**Strategy note for future self:** From (5,6), go RIGHT to (6,6) next turn. Eat that apple, tie score, then consider LEFT to (5,6) or UP to (5,7) to keep options open. If opponent heads toward us, prep for a head-on in an open spot \u2013 we want to win by points. Stay aggressive, chat! We're live!\n\nLet's eat! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

We just moved UP last turn to (5,6) (oh wait, no\u2014the LAST MOVE was UP to (5,5) in the replay? Actually the replay says we moved UP to (5,5) last turn, but our current head is at (5,6) in the board state! That means we already moved UP this turn? Let me check: The board shows head at (5,6), and the last move in replay was UP from (5,5) to (5,6)? But the turn is 39/150, and the last move shown is for turn 38? Wait, the replay says \"Turn: 38\" and we moved UP to (5,5)?? That seems off. Let's clarify: The current state says we're at (5,6) with head, and we just ate an apple? Actually, the apples collected is 17, so we must have eaten recently. I'll trust the board state: we're at (5,6) now.\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (5,6). Body: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)] (length 17). 17 apples.\n- **Opponent Snake #1:** Head at (0,9). Body: [(0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9)] (length 18). 18 apples. They're at the top-left corner.\n- **Apples:** From (5,6), we have apple at (6,6) (RIGHT), (5,7) maybe? Actually (5,7) isn't listed, but (6,6) is apple. Also (4,6) is empty (row 6: x=4 is '.'), (5,7) is '.' (row 7: x=5 is '.'). We can eat (6,6) next turn if we go RIGHT now? Wait, we're at (5,6), if we go RIGHT to (6,6), we eat apple! That's immediate apple gain, tying us at 18 apples. That's huge for aggression.\n- **Threats:** Opponent is far (distance 9 horizontally, 3 vertically). No immediate head-on collision risk unless they move RIGHT and we move LEFT? But they're at (0,9), we're at (5,6). They might move UP? (0,9) is top edge, UP goes off board! So they can't go UP. They can go RIGHT to (1,9), DOWN to (0,8), or LEFT to (-1,9) invalid. So likely RIGHT or DOWN. We're safe.\n\n**POTENTIAL MOVES FROM (5,6):**\n1. **RIGHT to (6,6):** Apple there! EAT it! Safe? Check: (6,6) is not occupied by any snake body. Our body is at (5,5), (5,4), etc.\u2014none at (6,6). Opponent body is at (6,9) and (7,9), (8,9)\u2014none at (6,6). So safe. Immediate apple gain. After move, head at (6,6), body extends. From there, next options: UP to (6,7), DOWN to (6,5) (empty? row 5: x=6 is 'A'? Actually row 5: \"1 . T A . A . . A .\" -> x=6 is '.'), LEFT to (5,6) (empty), RIGHT to (7,6) (empty? row 6: x=7 is '.'). So 3 safe options. Good.\n2. **UP to (5,7):** (5,7) is empty? Row 7: \"T . T A . . . . A A\" -> x=5 is '.' (between x=3 'T' and x=4 'A'). Safe. But no apple immediate. From there, can go RIGHT to (6,7) (empty), DOWN back to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7) (empty? row 7: x=4 is 'A'? Actually row 7: x=3 'T', x=4 'A', so (4,7) is apple? Wait, (4,7) is not listed in apples? Apple list has (7,8), (4,1), etc.\u2014not (4,7). So empty. UP to (5,8) (empty? row 8: x=5 is '.'? Row 8: \"T . T A . . . A . .\" -> x=5 is '.'). So 3 options. But we miss (6,6) apple for now.\n3. **LEFT to (4,6):** (4,6) is empty? Row 6: x=4 is '.' (between x=3 'A' and x=5 '.'). Safe. No apple immediate. From there, can go UP to (4,7) (empty), DOWN to (4,5) (empty), RIGHT to (5,6), LEFT to (3,6) (apple! (3,6) is listed in apples). So 4 options, including apple at (3,6). Good.\n4. **DOWN to (5,5):** (5,5) is currently our first body segment! That's moving into own body\u2014DEAD. Also, from board state, (5,5) is part of our body. So illegal. ELIMINATED.\n\n**ELIMINATED MOVES:**\n- **DOWN:** immediate death (into own body). No go.\n- **UP and LEFT:** safe but miss the immediate apple. We're trailing by 1 apple\u2014we NEED to eat now to tie! Aggression is key.\n\n**BEST MOVE: RIGHT to (6,6)**\n- **Why?** Eats apple immediately, ties score at 18. We're 1 behind, so this closes the gap and keeps pressure on. If opponent crashes or doesn't eat, we lead.\n- **Safety:** Totally safe. No collisions. After eating, our body grows, but we have escape routes: UP, DOWN, LEFT all open. No trap.\n- **Long-term plan:** From (6,6) after eating, next turn consider UP to (6,7) to chase more apples or position for head-on if we get ahead. We're controlling the center now\u2014opponent is stuck in corner. If they move toward us, we can force collision later when we have equal or more apples. Keep the pressure! We're live! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self:** Eat (6,6) to tie. From there, scout for next apple (maybe (7,8) or (8,7)). If opponent heads right, prep to cut them off. We win by points\u2014stay aggressive.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

We're at (6,7) and we need to make a MOVE that keeps us ALIVE while setting up to DOMINATE the center and force a head-on collision when we pull ahead!\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n\nFrom (6,7), let's check our moves:\n\n- **UP to (6,8):** That's an APPLE at (6,8)? Wait, looking at the board... (6,8) is actually EMPTY based on the board state (row 8: T 1 T A . . . A . .). But (6,8) is within bounds. Is there an apple there? Let me check the apple list... (6,8) isn't listed! The apples are at (4,0), (8,5), (1,0), (3,8), (1,3), (3,7), (8,7), (9,7), (0,0), (6,6), (3,5), (4,3), (3,6), (7,8), (4,1). NO apple at (6,8). But (7,8) is an apple! That's at x=7, y=8. If we go UP to (6,8), we might be setting up to get (7,8) next turn. But is (6,8) safe? The board shows (6,8) as EMPTY (row 8 has T at 0, 1 at 1, T at 2, A at 3, then dots...). Looking at row 8: \"T 1 T A . . . A . .\" So (6,8) is a dot (empty). SAFE. But no immediate apple. However, (7,8) is an apple! So if we go UP to (6,8), next turn we could go RIGHT to (7,8) and eat that apple!\n\n- **DOWN to (6,6):** That's where we just came from (we were at (5,6) and moved RIGHT to (6,6) last turn). Actually wait, we moved RIGHT from (5,6) to (6,6) last turn, so now our head is at (6,7). So DOWN to (6,6) is our previous position. But is it empty? Our body should be at (6,6) from last turn's move... Let's trace: Our body list is [(5,7), (5,6), ...]. So (6,6) is NOT in our body list currently. But wait, we just moved into (6,6) last turn, so (6,6) should be part of our body now... Actually our body list shows (5,7), (5,6), etc. We moved from (5,6) to (6,7) or (6,6)? Last move was RIGHT from (5,6), so we should be at (6,6), not (6,7). \n\nHold on! Let me re-read the board state. Our head is listed as (6,7). So we're at (6,7) NOW. That means our last move must have been UP from (6,6) to (6,7), not RIGHT from (5,6). But the replay says we moved RIGHT... There's inconsistency. Let me trust the CURRENT state: head at (6,7). So DOWN to (6,6) would be where we just came from? But (6,6) has an apple! That's in the apple list. So if we go DOWN to (6,6), we'd eat another apple, growing to 19! But is (6,6) empty? Our body should occupy it if we just came from there... Our body list doesn't show (6,6). It shows (5,7) as the first body segment. So (6,6) might be empty. But wait, we just ate (6,6) last turn according to the replay... This is confusing. Let me trust the board state: (6,6) shows \"A\" in row 6. So it has an apple! And it's not listed as occupied by our body. So DOWN to (6,6) would eat another apple immediately! That would give us 19 apples and the lead!\n\n- **LEFT to (5,7):** That's our body! The first body segment is (5,7). So moving LEFT into our own body = DEATH. \u274c\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,7):** Check board row 7: \"T . T A . T 0 . A A\" So (7,7) is a dot (empty). Is it safe? Our body is elsewhere. (7,7) is empty and within bounds. But no apple there. However, (8,7) is an apple (listed in apple drops) and row 7 shows \"A\" at position 8. So (7,7) is a safe move that sets up to get (8,8) or (8,7) next.\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nDOWN to (6,6) seems to have an apple! If we can eat it, we get 19 apples and lead. But is (6,6) actually empty? Our body list doesn't include (6,6), and board shows \"A\" there. So it should be safe. However, we need to be careful: if we moved to (6,7) last turn from (6,6), then (6,6) is our previous position and might be part of our tail. But our tail is at (6,2). So (6,6) should be empty now. Actually, as we move, our tail moves forward. So (6,6) should be empty after moving forward. Let me think: we were at (6,6) last turn (after eating apple), then we moved UP to (6,7) this turn? But the current state says head is at (6,7). So yes, we moved UP to (6,7). Therefore (6,6) is now empty and still has an apple (if it hadn't been eaten). Wait, but we ate (6,6) last turn! So (6,6) should no longer have an apple. This is very confusing.\n\nLet me re-examine: The apple list includes (6,6). If we ate it last turn, it should be removed. But it's still in the list. So either we didn't eat it, or the list includes all apples ever dropped. Looking at the replay: we moved RIGHT to (6,6) and ate it. So (6,6) should be empty now. But the board state shows (6,6) as \"A\". This suggests the board state reflects current apples, meaning (6,6) still has an apple. That means we didn't eat it? But the replay says we did. There's a contradiction.\n\nLet me trust the board state as given. If (6,6) shows \"A\", then moving DOWN to (6,6) would eat an apple. But we must verify it's not occupied by our body. Our body list: [(5,7), (5,6), ...]. (6,6) is not there. So it should be empty. But wait, if we moved UP to (6,7) this turn, then (6,6) is empty now. So DOWN to (6,6) should be safe and would eat an apple.\n\nHowever, there's risk: Snake #1 is at (1,8) with body stretching down to (6,9). If we go DOWN to (6,6), we might be moving toward their area. But (6,6) is far from them.\n\nActually, let me check the opponent's position more carefully. Snake #1 head is at (1,8), body includes (6,9). So they're in the top-left area. We're at (6,7). Going DOWN to (6,6) moves us away from them. That seems safe.\n\nBut wait, if we eat (6,6), we grow. That means our tail won't move, so (6,6) becomes part of our body immediately. That might block us later. But we're thinking about immediate gain.\n\nGiven we're tied and want to lead, eating an apple is valuable. But we need to make sure (6,6) is actually empty. The board shows \"A\" at (6,6). The apple list includes (6,6). So unless we ate it, it's there. But the replay says we ate it... This is a mess.\n\nLet me look at the board state again:\nRow 6: \"T . T A . T A . . .\"\nSo at x=6, y=6, it's \"A\". That means there IS an apple at (6,6). So we should eat it if we can.\n\nBut is (6,6) safe from our own body? Our head is at (6,7). Our body goes down to (6,2). So (6,6) is occupied by our body! Wait, let's list our body from head to tail:\nHead: (6,7)\nBody: (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo our body does NOT include (6,6). It includes (6,4), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). But (6,6) and (6,5) are empty! So moving DOWN to (6,6) is safe from our own body.\n\nBut wait, there's (6,4) in our body. So (6,5) is between (6,7) and (6,4)? Actually, our body is at (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (6,4). So there's a gap between (6,7) and (6,4). The cells (6,6) and (6,5) are empty. So moving DOWN to (6,6) is safe!\n\nTherefore, DOWN to (6,6) is a great move: we eat an apple, grow to 19 apples, and take the lead!\n\nBut hold on: we need to consider the opponent's potential move. If Snake #1 sees us moving toward the center, they might try to cut us off. But with them at (1,8), they're far away.\n\nActually, let me think about long-term strategy. We want to box them in and force head-on collisions. Moving DOWN to (6,6) puts us in the center-left area. We can then move RIGHT to (7,6) or UP to (6,7) (but we just left (6,7)). \n\nWait, if we move DOWN to (6,6) and eat the apple, our head will be at (6,6) and our body will extend (tail won't move because we grew). That means our body will be: (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), ... So (6,7) becomes body. That's fine.\n\nBut actually, if we eat an apple, our tail stays, so our body becomes: head (6,6), then previous head (6,7) becomes first body segment, then the rest shift. So (6,7) becomes occupied. That means we can't go back UP to (6,7) next turn. But that's okay, we can go other directions.\n\nGiven we're tied and want the lead, and (6,6) appears to have an apple and is safe, I think DOWN is the play!\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the board. Row 6: \"T . T A . T A . . .\"\nPosition 6 is the 7th character (0-indexed: 0:T, 1:., 2:T, 3:A, 4:., 5:T, 6:A, 7:., 8:., 9:.). So (6,6) is indeed \"A\".\n\nAnd our body doesn't occupy (6,6). So DOWN is safe and profitable!\n\nHowever, I should consider: is there any chance Snake #1 can move into (6,6) on the same turn? Their head is at (1,8). To reach (6,6) in one move, they'd need to move RIGHT and DOWN, but they can only move one direction. The Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |6-8| = 5+2=7. They can't reach (6,6) in one turn. So we're safe from head-on collision there.\n\nWhat about them moving into our path? They could move toward us, but they're far.\n\nSo DOWN seems safe and beneficial.\n\nBut wait, what if (6,6) doesn't actually have an apple because we ate it? The board state might be outdated? No, the board state is current for this turn. It shows \"A\" at (6,6). So we should trust that.\n\nActually, let me check if (6,6) is in the apple list: Yes, it's listed as (6,6). So there IS an apple there.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident: DOWN to (6,6) to eat the apple and take the lead!\n\nBut hold on one more thing: The replay says we moved RIGHT to (6,6) last turn. That means we should have eaten (6,6) last turn. So why is there still an apple at (6,6)? This suggests the board state might be showing apples that were already eaten? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLet me re-read the replay: \"RIGHT to (6,6): APPLE! Safe, no bodies there.\" So we ate (6,6) last turn. Therefore, (6,6) should NOT have an apple this turn. But the board state shows \"A\" at (6,6). This is a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the board state includes all apples that were ever dropped, regardless of being eaten? Or maybe the board only updates to show empty cells for apples, and (6,6) should be empty but is shown as \"A\" due to a display error? Or maybe I'm misreading the coordinates.\n\nLet me look at the board again carefully:\nRow 6 (y=6): \"T . T A . T A . . .\"\nThis means:\nx=0: T\nx=1: .\nx=2: T\nx=3: A\nx=4: .\nx=5: T\nx=6: A\nx=7: .\nx=8: .\nx=9: .\n\nSo (6,6) is \"A\". If we ate it last turn, it should be empty. But maybe the board hasn't been updated? Or maybe the \"A\" at (6,6) is a different apple that was dropped later? The apple drops list includes (6,6) as one of the apples. It doesn't specify when it was dropped. So maybe (6,6) was already eaten and there's no apple there, but the board still shows \"A\" for some reason? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board state is accurate and (6,6) still has an apple because we didn't actually eat it? But the replay says we did. This is confusing.\n\nLet me look at our body position. Our head is at (6,7). Our body includes (5,7), (5,6), etc. So we moved from (5,6) to somewhere. If we moved RIGHT from (5,6), we'd be at (6,6). But our head is at (6,7). So we must have moved UP from (6,6) to (6,7). That means we were at (6,6) last turn, ate the apple, then moved UP to (6,7) this turn? But the replay says we moved RIGHT last turn. \n\nI think there's a timing issue. The replay is for turn 40. The current turn is 41. So at turn 40, we were at (5,6) and moved RIGHT to (6,6) and ate the apple. Then turn 41 starts, and we're now at (6,6) with the apple eaten. But the current state shows head at (6,7), which suggests we moved UP to (6,7) already? No, the current state is for the START of turn 41, before we move. So if we moved to (6,6) at turn 40, our head should be at (6,6) at the start of turn 41. But the state says (6,7). \n\nThis indicates that after eating (6,6) at turn 40, we must have moved UP to (6,7) as part of turn 40? But that doesn't make sense - we only move once per turn. \n\nI think I need to trust the current state as given: head at (6,7). That means at the start of turn 41, we're at (6,7). So our last move (turn 40) was from (5,6) to (6,7)? That would be UP-RIGHT, but we can only move one direction. So that's impossible.\n\nActually, from (5,6), UP would be (5,7). RIGHT would be (6,6). So if we're at (6,7), we must have been at (6,6) and moved UP. So the replay must be wrong, or I'm misreading it.\n\nGiven the confusion, I should focus on what's certain:\n- Current head: (6,7)\n- Board state shows (6,6) as \"A\" (has apple)\n- Our body does not include (6,6)\n- Therefore, moving DOWN to (6,6) would take us to a cell with an apple, and it's safe from our own body\n- Snake #1 cannot reach (6,6) in one move\n- Eating the apple would give us 19 apples and the lead\n\nSo I'll go DOWN to eat the apple!\n\nBut wait, let me check if (6,6) is actually accessible. From (6,7), DOWN goes to (6,6). That's valid.\n\nOne more concern: If we eat (6,6), we grow. That means our tail stays where it is (at (6,2)), so our body becomes longer. This could trap us later if we're not careful. But given we're trying to dominate the board and box in the opponent, being bigger is good.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,6), our head will be at (6,6) and our body will include (6,7). So we'll have a vertical segment. That might limit our movement options, but we can still go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT from (6,6). LEFT to (5,6) is our body? Our body includes (5,6), so LEFT would be death. DOWN to (6,5) should be empty. RIGHT to (6,7) is now our body (since we grew), so RIGHT would be death. So from (6,6), our only safe moves would be DOWN to (6,5). That's a problem! We'd be trapped moving DOWN.\n\nOh wait, that's a critical consideration! If we eat the apple at (6,6), then next turn our head at (6,6) will have body at (6,7) (new), (5,7), (5,6), etc. So:\n- UP to (6,7): body - death\n- DOWN to (6,5): empty? (6,5) is not in our body list. Should be empty.\n- LEFT to (5,6): body - death  \n- RIGHT to (6,7): body - death (same as UP)\n\nSo only DOWN would be safe! That's a dead end. We'd be forced to go DOWN to (6,5), and then from (6,5) we might have more options. Let's check (6,5): board row 5 shows \"T . T A . T . . A .\" so (6,5) is the 6th character: position 6 is \"T\"? Wait, let's count row 5: \"T . T A . T . . A .\" \nx=0: T\nx=1: .\nx=2: T\nx=3: A\nx=4: .\nx=5: T\nx=6: .\nx=7: .\nx=8: A\nx=9: .\n\nSo (6,5) is actually \".\" (empty). Good. From (6,5), we could go:\n- UP to (6,6): our body (since we just ate it)\n- DOWN to (6,4): our body! (6,4) is in our body list\n- LEFT to (5,5): our body? (5,5) is in our body list\n- RIGHT to (6,4): same as DOWN, our body\n\nSo from (6,5), ALL directions would be death! That's a trap!\n\nOh no! So eating (6,6) would trap us in a dead end. That's terrible strategy.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go DOWN to (6,6), even though it has an apple. We'd get the apple but die next turn.\n\nSo we must choose another move.\n\nLet's re-evaluate:\n\n**UP to (6,8):** \n- Safe? Board row 8: \"T 1 T A . . . A . .\" so (6,8) is \".\" (empty). No apple there.\n- But (7,8) is an apple! So we could go UP to (6,8) now, then RIGHT to (7,8) next turn to eat that apple.\n- From (6,8), what moves are available?\n  - UP to (6,9): row 9 shows \"T T T T T T T . . .\" so (6,9) is \"T\" (snake body!). That's Snake #1's body (they have (6,9) in their body list). So UP would be death.\n  - DOWN to (6,7): our current position, but after moving UP, (6,7) becomes part of our body. So DOWN would be into our own body - death.\n  - LEFT to (5,8): board row 8 shows \"T 1 T A . . . A . .\" so (5,8) is the 5th character: position 5 is \".\" (empty). Is it safe? Check if (5,8) is in our body: no. So LEFT is safe.\n  - RIGHT to (7,8): that's an apple! And (7,8) is empty? Row 8 shows position 7 is \".\" (empty). Actually, (7,8) should have an apple according to the apple list. But the board shows (7,8) as \"A\"? Let's check row 8: \"T 1 T A . . . A . .\" so positions: 0:T, 1:1, 2:T, 3:A, 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:A, 8:., 9:.\nSo (7,8) is \"A\"! That means if we go UP to (6,8), next turn we can go RIGHT to (7,8) and eat that apple. But from (6,8), RIGHT to (7,8) would be the apple. Is (7,8) safe from bodies? Our body won't be there. Snake #1's body is at (6,9), (5,9), etc. (7,8) is not in their body list. So it should be safe.\n\nSo UP to (6,8) seems promising: no immediate apple, but sets up to get (7,8) next turn, and we have multiple escape routes (LEFT to (5,8) is safe).\n\n**LEFT to (5,7):** This is our body (first body segment). So moving LEFT into our own body = DEATH. Cannot do.\n\n**RIGHT to (7,7):** \n- Board row 7: \"T . T A . T 0 . A A\" so (7,7) is \".\" (empty).\n- (8,7) is an apple (row 7 shows \"A\" at position 8). So we could go RIGHT to (7,7) now, then RIGHT to (8,7) next turn to eat that apple.\n- From (7,7), what moves are available?\n  - UP to (7,8): that's an apple! And (7,8) is \"A\" on row 8. So we could eat (7,8) from there.\n  - DOWN to (7,6): board row 6 shows (7,6) is \".\" (empty).\n  - LEFT to (6,7): our current position, but after moving RIGHT, (6,7) becomes body. So LEFT would be into our own body - death.\n  - RIGHT to (8,7): apple! And (8,7) is \"A\" on row 7.\n\nSo from (7,7), we have UP, DOWN, RIGHT as options. LEFT would be death. So 3 safe moves. That's better than being trapped.\n\nAlso, (7,7) is closer to the opponent? They're at (1,8), so not really.\n\nComparing UP to (6,8) vs RIGHT to (7,7):\n- (6,8): 1 safe move next turn (LEFT to (5,8)), maybe RIGHT to (7,8) but (7,8) is apple so that's safe actually.\nWait, from (6,8):\n  - LEFT to (5,8): safe (empty)\n  - RIGHT to (7,8): apple, safe\n  - DOWN to (6,7): death (own body)\n  - UP to (6,9): death (opponent body)\n\nSo actually 2 safe moves from (6,8): LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nFrom (7,7):\n  - UP to (7,8): apple, safe\n  - DOWN to (7,6): safe (empty)\n  - RIGHT to (8,7): apple, safe\n  - LEFT to (6,7): death (own body)\n\nSo 3 safe moves from (7,7).\n\nTherefore, (7,7) gives more options.\n\nAlso, (7,7) is more central and could help us control the board. (6,8) is closer to the opponent's body at (6,9), which might be risky if they move down.\n\nLet's check the opponent's possible moves. Snake #1 is at (1,8). They might move:\n- UP to (1,9): row 9 shows (1,9) is \"T\" (their own body). So UP would be death for them.\n- DOWN to (1,7): row 7 shows (1,7) is \".\" (empty). That's safe for them.\n- LEFT to (0,8): row 8 shows (0,8) is \"T\" (their own body). Death.\n- RIGHT to (2,8): row 8 shows (2,8) is \"T\" (their own body). Death.\n\nSo actually, Snake #1 can ONLY move DOWN to (1,7)! They're trapped! That's great for us. They have no other safe moves. So they'll definitely move DOWN to (1,7).\n\nThat means they're moving away from us. So we don't need to worry about them for this turn.\n\nNow, back to our move. We want to eat apples and control the board. (7,7) gives us access to two apples: (7,8) and (8,7). (6,8) gives us access to (7,8) as well.\n\nBut (7,7) also gives us DOWN to (7,6), which might lead to more apples. Let's check row 6: (7,6) is empty. (8,6) is empty? Row 6 shows position 8 is \".\" (empty). (9,6) is empty. So there might be a path to the right side.\n\nAlso, we want to dominate and box in the opponent. The opponent is at (1,7) after they move. We're at (6,7) now. If we move RIGHT to (7,7), we get closer to the right edge and can start claiming that territory.\n\nGiven the opponent is forced into a corner at (1,7), we have time to eat apples and grow. We should prioritize moves that give us apples while keeping our options open.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:\n- UP to (6,8): no immediate apple, but sets up for (7,8) next turn. 2 safe moves next turn.\n- RIGHT to (7,7): no immediate apple, but sets up for (7,8) or (8,7) next turn. 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nRIGHT gives more options and moves us toward the right side where there are apples (8,7) and (7,8). Also, (7,7) is a more central position.\n\nI think RIGHT is the better move.\n\nBut wait, what about DOWN? We already determined it's a trap. So discard.\n\nLEFT is death.\n\nSo it's between UP and RIGHT.\n\nLet me think about long-term. We want to force head-on collisions when we're ahead. To do that, we need to control the board and limit the opponent's space. Moving RIGHT expands our control toward the right edge. The opponent is on the left side. We can potentially create a barrier.\n\nAlso, there are apples at (7,8) and (8,7). By moving to (7,7), we're adjacent to both. We can eat one next turn.\n\nIf we go UP to (6,8), we're only adjacent to (7,8). (8,7) is farther.\n\nSo RIGHT seems better for apple access.\n\nMoreover, from (7,7), if we go RIGHT to (8,7) and eat that apple, we grow and can then go UP to (8,8) or DOWN to (8,6) or continue RIGHT. (8,8) is empty (row 8 shows position 8 is \".\"). (8,6) is empty. So good options.\n\nFrom (6,8), if we go RIGHT to (7,8) and eat that apple, we grow and then from (7,8) we can go:\n- LEFT to (6,8): our body (death)\n- RIGHT to (8,8): empty\n- DOWN to (7,7): empty\n- UP to (7,9): row 9 shows (7,9) is \"T\" (opponent body). Death.\n\nSo 2 safe moves from (7,8). Not bad.\n\nBut from (8,7) (if we eat that apple), we can go:\n- LEFT to (7,7): our body (death)\n- RIGHT to (9,7): row 7 shows (9,7) is \"A\" (apple!)\n- DOWN to (8,6): empty\n- UP to (8,8): empty\n\nSo 3 safe moves from (8,7). Better!\n\nTherefore, targeting (8,7) is better than (7,8). And RIGHT to (7,7) sets us up for (8,7) next turn.\n\nSo RIGHT is the optimal move!\n\nOne final check: Is (7,7) truly safe from our own body? Our body is: (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). So (7,7) is not in that list. Safe!\n\nIs it safe from the opponent's body? Their body is: (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9). So (7,7) is not in their body. Safe!\n\nAlso, we need to consider if the opponent's head could move into (7,7) on the same turn. They're at (1,8) and can only move DOWN to (1,7). So no risk of head-on collision.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT to (7,7) is safe and strategic!\n\nLet's go with RIGHT!YO CHAT! Turn 41 and we're TIED at 18-18! The opponent is trapped at (1,8) with only one safe move DOWN to (1,7). Meanwhile, we're at (6,7) with multiple options. \n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (6,8):** Empty, sets up for (7,8) apple next turn. But we'd be closer to their body at (6,9). 2 safe next moves.\n- **DOWN to (6,6):** Has an apple BUT it's a TRAP! After eating, we'd be stuck with only one move (DOWN to (6,5)), then completely trapped. \u274c\n- **LEFT to (5,7):** Our own body - instant death. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (7,7):** Empty, sets up for TWO apples next turn ((7,8) and (8,7)). From here we'll have 3 escape routes and can dominate the right side while opponent is stuck left. \u2705\n\n**STRATEGY:** Move RIGHT to claim the center-right territory. Next turn we eat either (7,8) or (8,7) and keep expanding. We're building a wall to box in Snake #1 while growing our lead. Force that head-on collision when we're ahead! Let's gooo! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 43 and we just ate that apple at (8,7) to TIE IT UP 18-18! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d We're locked in a death match with Snake #1. \n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (8,8):** Apple! \ud83c\udf4e We'd grow to 19 and take the LEAD. But check the board: (8,8) is marked \"A\" in the drops. From there, we'd have DOWN back to (8,7), LEFT to (7,8), and RIGHT to (9,8) which looks empty. Sets up nicely.\n- **DOWN to (8,6):** Empty. From there, we could go DOWN to (8,5) which has an apple, or LEFT to (7,6) which is empty. But this moves us away from the action.\n- **LEFT to (7,7):** That's our body! We just left (7,7) last turn. INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (9,7):** That's also an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Row 7 shows \"A\" at position 9. We'd eat it and grow to 19, taking the lead. From there, we'd have UP to (9,8), DOWN to (9,6), and LEFT back to (8,7) which will be our body.\n\n**STRATEGY:** I'm going RIGHT to (9,7)! Why? Because Snake #1 is still stuck in the top-left corner. They're trapped with only a few escape routes. By eating at (9,7), I grow to 19 apples and maintain board dominance. From (9,7), I can go UP to (9,8) next turn (empty), DOWN to (9,6) (empty), or if needed LEFT back. I'm boxing them in from the right side while they're trapped left. \n\nThe key here is that while they're playing defense in the corner, I'm expanding my territory and eating to secure the lead. If I can keep growing while they're stuck, we'll force them into a bad position for head-on collision when I'm ahead. Let's GOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 44 and the score is RAZOR THIN: 19 vs 18 in our favor! \ud83d\udd25 The enemy Snake #1 is still locked in the top-left, and we just ate at (9,7) to take the lead. Now we gotta keep the pressure on.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (9, 8):** From (9,7), UP takes us to (9,8). Checking the board: row 8 has \"A\" at column 8? Actually looking at the board state: row 8 shows \"T T T A . . . A . .\" \u2013 so (8,8) is an apple, but (9,8) is empty! The apple drops list (8,5) and (7,8), but (9,8) isn't listed. So (9,8) is safe. From (9,8) we'd have UP to (9,9) which is \"T\" (terminal/body), DOWN back to (9,7), LEFT to (8,8) which has an apple.\n- **DOWN to (9, 6):** From (9,7), DOWN to (9,6). Board row 6 shows \"T T T A . T A . . .\" so (9,6) is \"T\" (opponent's body part? Wait, row 6 is \"6 T T T A . T A . . .\" meaning columns 0-3 are T, col 4 is A, col 5 is T, col 6 is A... col 9 is \".\"? Actually let's parse: \"6 T T T A . T A . . .\" \u2013 that's 10 characters: col0=T, col1=T, col2=T, col3=A, col4=., col5=T, col6=A, col7=., col8=., col9=., so (9,6) is empty! But check the body lists: my body includes (9,6)? My body list: (9,7) head, then (8,7)... down to (6,1). No (9,6). So (9,6) is empty. From (9,6) we could go UP back, DOWN to (9,5) which is \"A\" (row5 col9 is A), LEFT to (8,6) which is \"A\"? Row6 col8 is \".\" actually. So options are okay.\n- **LEFT to (8, 7):** That's my body! I just left (8,7) last turn (now part of my body). INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (10, 7):** Off board! DEAD. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY:** UP to (9,8) is the move. Why? It keeps us moving along the top-right edge, safe from our own body (since we're at the edge). From (9,8), we can go LEFT to (8,8) next turn\u2014apple there! \ud83c\udf4e That would grow us to 20 and extend our lead. Meanwhile, Snake #1 is still in the top-left corner with limited space; they might be forced to move into us or get trapped. By advancing along the top, we're boxing them into the left side while we claim the right. If they try to challenge us head-on, we have the lead (19 vs 18) so a collision would favor us (they'd die first if scores tied? Actually rule: if two heads collide, both die. But if we have more apples at game end, we win. However, if they die and we survive, we win immediately. So forcing a collision when we're ahead is risky because both die\u2014it's a draw if scores tied. Better to grow and corner them, let them crash into our body. So let's stay safe, eat, and dominate.\n\nPlan for next few turns: Eat at (8,8) next turn to grow, then consider moving left along row 8 to hunt more apples while keeping distance from enemy. If they come down, we can drop into row 7 or 6 to cut them off. We control the right side\u2014let's keep it that way!\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\n**START MOVE**\nUP\n**END MOVE**",

Moving UP keeps the left wall as a spine and forces #0 to chase us deeper, setting us up to cut across the central apple zone later. \ud83e\udd14 Should we try LEFT or RIGHT? Those would bite our own body right away, so no. \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Strategy note: climb up, then later turn right to sweep the (3,5)/(3,6) apple cluster, then swing for a head\u2011on when we hit 20+ apples.
