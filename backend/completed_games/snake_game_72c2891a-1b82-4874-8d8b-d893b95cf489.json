Both will immediately give me a point.\n\nLet's think about what happens after collecting either apple:\n- If I go LEFT and collect (5, 2), my next move could be LEFT again to start heading toward the apples on the left side\n- If I go DOWN and collect (6, 1), I'll need to go left afterward to reach other apples\n\nI think I'll choose LEFT to collect the apple at (5, 2). This positions me better for accessing the cluster of apples on the left side of the board (at (1, 3), (0, 3), and (0, 0)). This seems more efficient for my long-term apple collection strategy.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (5, 2) and collecting that apple, I'll likely continue moving LEFT to approach the apples at (1, 3) and (0, 3).
