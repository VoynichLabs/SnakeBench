I'll try to move in a direction that will allow me to get closer to the apple while avoiding any potential obstacles.\n\nStrategy: I'll try to move diagonally up and to the right, which will allow me to get closer to the apple while also keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
