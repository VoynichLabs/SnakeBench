          "rationale": "The current turn is 0. My snake (ID 0) is at (2, 8). I have no body segments.\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is at (7, 0).\nAvailable apples are at: (6, 1), (0, 9), (5, 3), (6, 0), (5, 7).\n\nMy goal is to collect apples safely. Since I have no body, self-collision is impossible unless I move off-board or into the enemy head.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves:\n\n**Current position:** (2, 8)\n\n1.  **UP** to (2, 9):\n    *   (2, 9) is on the board.\n    *   It is 1 unit away from apple (0, 9).\n    *   Safe from enemy collision: Enemy (7, 0) is far away.\n    *   This is a good move, getting closer to (0, 9).\n\n2.  **DOWN** to (2, 7):\n    *   (2, 7) is on the board.\n    *   Moves away from the closest apple (0, 9).\n    *   Safe from enemy collision.\n\n3.  **LEFT** to (1, 8):\n    *   (1, 8) is on the board.\n    *   It is 1 unit away from apple (0, 9).\n    *   Safe from enemy collision.\n    *   This is a good move, getting closer to (0, 9).\n\n4.  **RIGHT** to (3, 8):\n    *   (3, 8) is on the board.\n    *   Moves away from the closest apple (0, 9).\n    *   Safe from enemy collision.\n\nThe closest apple is (0, 9).\nMy current position (2, 8) is a Manhattan distance of $|2-0| + |8-9| = 2 + 1 = 3$ away from (0, 9).\n\n*   Moving UP to (2, 9): Distance to (0, 9) is $|2-0| + |9-9| = 2 + 0 = 2$.\n*   Moving LEFT to (1, 8): Distance to (0, 9) is $|1-0| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT reduce the distance to the target apple (0, 9).\n\nLet's check other apples:\n(5, 7) is $3+1 = 4$ away.\n(5, 3) is $3+5 = 8$ away.\n(6, 1) is $4+7 = 11$ away.\n(6, 0) is $4+8 = 12$ away.\n\nFocusing on (0, 9) seems best initially.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 9), my next move can be LEFT to (1, 9) or (1, 8) depending on whether I want to continue hugging the wall or move down. Next, to eat (0, 9), I'd need to go LEFT to (1, 9) then LEFT to (0, 9). Wait, if I go UP to (2, 9), then LEFT to (1, 9), then LEFT to (0, 9) *and the apple is still there*, I eat it on turn 3.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 8), my next move can be UP to (1, 9) or LEFT to (0, 8).\nIf I go LEFT to (1, 8), then UP to (1, 9), then LEFT to (0, 9). This is also 3 turns.\n\nThe path via UP: (2, 8) -> (2, 9) -> (1, 9) -> (0, 9).\nThe path via LEFT: (2, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (1, 9) -> (0, 9).\n\nBoth seem equally viable for reaching (0, 9).\n\nLet's look at the density of apples. (0, 9) is isolated. The cluster of apples is on the right/bottom: (5, 7), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 0). Snake #1 (7, 0) is very close to these right-side apples. It will likely try to grab (6, 0) or (6, 1).\n\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (7, 1), it is 1 move from (6, 1).\nIf Snake #1 moves LEFT to (6, 0), it eats an apple immediately. This is the most likely move for Snake #1.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves LEFT, it eats (6, 0).\nIf Snake #1 moves UP, it is next to (6, 1).\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT/DOWN, it goes off board or away from apples.\n\nGiven Snake #1 is likely targeting the lower right area, I should pursue (0, 9) which is uncontested.\n\nPath UP: (2, 9) is on the wall. This limits options (no UP move after).\nPath LEFT: (1, 8) opens up both UP and DOWN/LEFT movement flexibility if required.\n\nIf I choose LEFT, I'm at (1, 8).\nTurn 1: (1, 8). Options: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (to (2, 8), where my tail will be). All safe.\nIf I choose UP, I'm at (2, 9).\nTurn 1: (2, 9). Options: DOWN (to (2, 8)), LEFT, RIGHT. All safe.\n\nMoving LEFT seems slightly better as it keeps the top wall path open for 2 subsequent moves (UP then LEFT along Y=9) and also keeps the lower path open (DOWN).\n\nLet's commit to moving LEFT towards (0, 9).\n\nLEFT",
