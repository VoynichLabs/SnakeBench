But typically, in snake games, the body length is maintained, so I\u2019ll treat it as a single segment for simplicity.\n\n- The last move was None, so we're stationary at (7,7).\n\n- Apples are at:\n  - (5, 3)\n  - (2, 2)\n  - (2, 1)\n  - (9, 4)\n  - (0, 9)\n\n- Enemies:\n  - Snake #0 at (5, 9)\n\n- Board features:\n  - Walls at coordinates 0..9; positions outside are walls.\n  - Our position: (7,7).\n  - To reach apples:\n    - *Closest* apples in Manhattan distance:\n      - (5,3): distance 4 (abs(7-5)+abs(7-3))\n      - (2,2): distance 5\n      - (2,1): distance 6\n      - (9,4): distance 3\n      - (0,9): distance 9\n\nThe closest apple appears to be at (9,4), which is 3 units away, and the one at (5,3) is 4 away.\n\nConsidering (9,4):\n- From (7,7) going right (x+2), then down (y-3):\n  - Path is clear of obstacles based on current data, as no mention of obstacles blocking the straight route, except that the apple is at (9,4).\n- Moving right toward (9,4) is promising, but I must check:\n  - Moving RIGHT: next position (8,7), then (9,7), then down to (9,6), (9,5), and finally (9,4).\n  - Alternatively, an approach through (8,7), then (9,7), then down.\n\nIs there any immediate obstacle? The only enemy snake present is at (5,9); there are no other snakes or walls near our current position.\n\nTo avoid running into the walls or the enemy, moving RIGHT seems feasible:\n- We are at (7,7), moving RIGHT to (8,7), then to (9,7), and from there down to (9,4) is possible:\n  - Moving right (to (8,7))\n  - moving further to (9,7)\n  - moving down (to (9,6))\n  - down again (to (9,5))\n  - down again (to (9,4)), where the apple is.\n\nBut if I go right now:\n- Next position: (8,7). Is this safe?\n  - Walls are at x=8, y=7 is within boundaries.\n  - No obstacle report at (8,7).\n- Then move RIGHT again to (9,7): in bounds, no obstacle.\n- Next move DOWN to (9,6): in bounds, presumably safe.\n- Next move DOWN to (9,5): safe.\n- Next move DOWN to (9,4): apple position, so I gain a point and grow.\n\nAlternatively, consider the risk:\n- Moving right twice and down thrice may be safe, but it involves multiple moves, potentially exposing us to danger if the enemy or walls appear unexpectedly.\n\nI also consider if moving UP or LEFT can help:\n- Moving UP to (7,8): seems safe, but it doesn\u2019t bring us closer to apples.\n- Moving LEFT to (6,7): no immediate benefit to reach apples faster.\n\nThe most promising plan seems to be moving RIGHT soon to access the apple at (9,4), as the path is clear and direct.\n\nGiven that, I will:\n- First move RIGHT to position (8,7), progressing toward the apple at (9,4).\n\nNext turn, I can proceed further down toward (9,4). Since I want to prevent collisions, I'll go with:\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"
