Fresh start, clean slate, and we're ready to dominate this tiny little worm we call an opponent! \ud83d\ude02 Snake #0 is down at (1, 1), and we are up in the rafters at (3, 9). Time to set the tone, don't you think?\n\n**BATTLE PLAN:** We need to grab some early apples (Gotta get that content!), establish board dominance, and maybe start working our way towards boxing in that little guy! Our score is 0, his score is 0. Everyone's a tiny, tiny worm right now!\n\n**Turn 0 Analysis (Where can big moves be made?):**\n\nOur current position: (3, 9).\n\n1.  **UP (3, 10):** *Danger!* Off the board (9x9 max Y is 9). IMMEDIATE DEATH. \ud83d\udc80 No thank you!\n2.  **DOWN (3, 8):** Safe. Moves us towards the center. There's an apple at (2, 8) and (4, 6) isn't too far.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 9):** Safe. Moves us towards an apple at (2, 9). HYPE!\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 9):** Safe. A bit bare up here, but keeps options open.\n\n**Immediate Goals:** Grab that apple at (2, 9)! It's literally RIGHT THERE!\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT (2, 9):** Instant apple grab! Maximum content, maximum growth! This is the aggressive play we like!\n*   **DOWN (3, 8):** Safe, but doesn't immediately grab an apple.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 9):** Safe, but also doesn't grab an apple.\n\nSince we are only 1 segment long, we have no body to worry about crashing into. The opponent (Snake #0) is way down at (1, 1). There is absolutely no chance of a head-on collision or a body crash this turn.\n\n**Let's look at the best move: LEFT to (2, 9).** We secure the first apple, gaining a point and a body segment. This establishes early control. Easy decision!\n\n**Future Strategy (Next few turns):** After hitting (2, 9), we should push towards the next cluster of apples. Maybe (2, 8) or (0, 7)? We want to build length quickly to start controlling space and cutting off the little guy down below. We will monitor his movement, but for now, it's a content farming mission!\n\nLet's go get that W, Chat! \ud83c\udf4f\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT keeps us level, but still leaves the north lane unclaimed. UP, though? It moves us straight toward where Snake #1 is lurking, keeps multiple escape routes open (left, right, or further up), and sets us up to start sandwiching him between the board edge and our future body. No risky collisions there, just pure pressure.\n\nPlan: keep pushing upward while watching for his descent, then swing laterally to corral him\u2014force the head-on if he tries to drop down into our zone. Stay aggressive, keep the board in front of us open, and bait him into bad spacing. That\u2019s our blueprint for the next few turns.\n\nUP",

We are the alpha snake on this board!\n\n**SCORE CHECK:** We got 1 apple, the little worm (Snake #0) has 0. Already dominating the scoreboard.\n\n**BOARD STATE RE-ANALYSIS (Turn 1):**\nOur Head: (2, 9). Body: [(3, 9)].\nOpponent Head: (1, 2). Body: none.\n\nWe got a short snake, so our focus is still growing and starting to control the top half of that board!\n\n**Immediate Threats/Opportunities:**\n\n1.  **Our Body:** (3, 9). We cannot move back to (3, 9).\n2.  **Opponent:** Snake #0 is far away at (1, 2). No collision threat this turn unless we pull off a teleport hack! \ud83d\ude02\n3.  **Apples Nearby:** (2, 8) is an apple right below us! (0, 7) is also looking juicy!\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (2, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP (2, 10):** *DANGER!* Off the board, instant L. Hard pass!\n2.  **DOWN (2, 8):** **SAFE** and **APPLE!** This is a power move! We hit the apple, score becomes 2-0, and we block off that column slightly. Maximum content, minimum risk.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 9):** **SAFE.** Moves us along the wall towards (0, 7) (eventually). No immediate apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 9):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our new body segment (tail location). IMMEDIATE DEATH. No, we are NOT doing that!\n\n**The Obvious Play: DOWN to (2, 8)!**\n\nIt guarantees an apple, increases our body length to three, and pushes us slightly into the board center while maintaining high ground. This is exactly how we set up the next turns: securing resources, building length, and then boxing the little guy in when we're long enough!\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 2)):**\nHe is likely looking for apples too. Possible moves for him:\n*   UP to (1, 3).\n*   RIGHT to (2, 2) (No apple, but maybe cutting towards (2, 0)).\n*   DOWN to (1, 1) (No apple).\n*   LEFT to (0, 2) (No apple).\nHe is surrounded by apples at (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (0, 1). He will likely go *UP* to (1, 3) or *LEFT* to (0, 2) to prepare for the (0, 3) apple. Or maybe *DOWN* to (1, 1) to grab (1, 0) next turn. It doesn't matter much right now, because he is nowhere near us.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turn):**\nAfter moving to (2, 8) (and growing!), we will check (0, 7) next. Building length in the top-left quadrant is crucial to then start sweeping DOWN. We need to be aware of how Snake #0 grows and where he tries to establish control. For now, keep farming those easy, high-value apples!\n\nDOWN",

Snake #0 is stuck down low, looking tiny, and we are already controlling the high ground! Let's keep that momentum going!\n\n**CLIPS REVIEW:** That move to (2, 8) was pure alpha! We secured the apple, increased our length, and established dominance. Let's see what the little worm did!\n\n**TURN 2 SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 8).\n*   Body: [(2, 9), (3, 9)]. *A nice solid snake, three segments long!*\n*   Apples: 2.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (1, 3). *Looks like he moved UP from (1, 2).*\n*   Body: none.\n*   Apples: 0.\n\n**SCORE CHECK:** 2-0, baby! Unstoppable!\n\n**Immediate Threats/Opportunities:**\n\n1.  **Our Body Locations:** (2, 9) and (3, 9). Cannot move back to these.\n2.  **Opponent Threat:** He is at (1, 3). We are at (2, 8). Almost zero physical threat this turn. We love isolation!\n3.  **Apples Nearby:** The apple at (0, 7) is calling our name! A move to (1, 8) then to (0, 8) or (0, 7) looks good. Wait, there's another apple at (2, 6) just two squares down! Okay, options, options!\n\n**Step 1: Check for INSTANT DEATH Moves from (2, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP (2, 9):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our body segment (the one we just left). Instant L. NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN (2, 7):** **SAFE.** Moves us towards the apple at (2, 6).\n3.  **LEFT (1, 8):** **SAFE.** Moves us towards the apple at (0, 7).\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 8):** **SAFE.** Moves us away from the core action, but keeps us safe.\n\nOkay, three safe moves. UP is the only immediate killer. Let's analyze the safe moves for maximum value and board control!\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT to (1, 8):** This sets us up perfectly to grab the apple at (0, 7) next turn (if we move LEFT again). It positions us along the top wall, away from Snake #0. Good for board control and resource acquisition.\n\n*   **DOWN to (2, 7):** This moves us toward the apple at (2, 6). We would likely grab it next turn. This is also a strong vertical move, establishing our presence centrally.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 8):** Keeps us safe, but puts us slightly out of the action. No immediate apple reward. Less ideal.\n\n**Comparison (LEFT vs. DOWN):**\n\nThe apple at (0, 7) is high up in the corner, a very safe, high-value asset. The apple at (2, 6) is slightly more central.\n\nGiven we just moved vertically (DOWN), moving **LEFT** to (1, 8) allows us to spread out and establish control over the entire Northern wall. If we move LEFT, we guarantee a safe path to the (0, 7) apple on Turn 3. This gives us *maximum control* over our immediate future moves.\n\nIf we move DOWN, we are moving towards a slightly denser area of apples (2, 6) and (0, 6), which gives Snake #0 more potential routes if he moves up. Sticking to the wall is safer for dominance building.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #0 (at (1, 3)):**\nHe is still short and desperate for food. The apples (0, 3) and (1, 0) and (0, 1) are his targets.\nLikely moves: LEFT to (0, 3) (Grab apple) or DOWN to (1, 2) to prepare for (1, 0).\nHe cannot possibly interfere with our move to (1, 8) this turn. The closest he could come is (2, 4) if he moves RIGHT then UP, which is highly unlikely.\n\n**The Strategy: Corner the Market!**\nWe take the high-ground, easy apple at (0, 7). This will make us 4 segments long and give us a 3-0 lead. Then, we can use our size advantage to sweep down and start forcing walls or cornering the enemy.\n\n**Move Plan:** LEFT to (1, 8). Next turn, LEFT again to (0, 8), or possibly DOWN to (1, 7) to check for other options before (0, 7). Wait, the apple is at (0, 7). So moving LEFT to (1, 8) THEN LEFT to (0, 8) is safe, but (0, 7) is the prize.\n\nLet's look at the path to (0, 7) clearly.\n*   T2: Move LEFT to (1, 8).\n*   T3: Move DOWN to (1, 7).\n*   T4: Move LEFT to (0, 7). **(Apple!)**\n\nThis three-turn path secures a key corner resource. Alternatively:\n*   T2: Move LEFT to (1, 8).\n*   T3: Move LEFT to (0, 8). (Safe but no apple)\n*   T4: Move DOWN to (0, 7). **(Apple!)**\n\nBoth work, but the second option is staying higher and keeping options open longer. Let's stick with moving LEFT this turn to establish that left flank!\n\nThis move is safe, furthers our growth plan, and puts us in control of the high-value corner apple. Let's go, Chat! We're building a fortress up here! \ud83c\udff0\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turn):** Secure the (0, 7) apple in the next two moves by continuing LEFT, then DOWN, or DOWN, then LEFT along the 8-row and 7-row. We need to reach 4 apples quickly to maximize our length advantage before engaging Snake #0.\n***\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 is probably crying into his keyboard right now. 2-0 score lead, let's go for 3!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS (Turn 3):**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (1, 8)\n    *   Body: [(2, 8), (2, 9)] (Wait, my body on the board state is T at (2, 9) and (3, 9). Let's check the history. Ah, my previous plan review showed the body as [(2, 9), (3, 9)] when I was at (2, 8). Now that I moved LEFT from (2, 8) to (1, 8), the body segments are now at **(2, 8)** and **(2, 9)**. The tail has moved to (2, 9) from the previous (3, 9). Okay, confirmed. Body: [(2, 8), (2, 9)]. We are 3 segments long.\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (1, 4)\n    *   Body: none. Still a baby worm.\n*   **Apples nearby:** (0, 7) (HIGH PRIORITY), (2, 6), (0, 6).\n\n**Step 1: The Safety Check (From (1, 8))**\n\n1.  **UP (1, 9):** **SAFE.** High wall control.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 7):** **SAFE.** Moves towards the apple at (0, 7).\n3.  **LEFT (0, 8):** **SAFE.** Moves towards the apple at (0, 7).\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 8):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our body segment. Instant L. NOPE!\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Chat, which one is the money move?\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating Value and Board Control (UP, DOWN, LEFT)**\n\nOur next target is the apple at (0, 7).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 7):** This is a direct path to the corner apple (0, 7) by moving LEFT next turn. It's solid. It also keeps us on a high row (row 7) and gives us slightly more room to maneuver vertically if needed.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 8):** This also sets us up for the corner apple (0, 7) by moving DOWN next turn. It hugs the side wall, maximizing safety by limiting attack angles from Snake #0 (who is still far away). This is excellent for asserting absolute dominance over the top-left quadrant.\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 9):** Keeps us safe along the top edge, but doesn't immediately advance on the (0, 7) apple. Less efficient than LEFT or DOWN. We are kings of the 8-row, so why move to the 9-row unless we have to?\n\n**Comparison (LEFT vs. DOWN):**\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN position us to grab the apple at (0, 7) on Turn 4.\n\n*   LEFT to (0, 8) then DOWN to (0, 7)\n*   DOWN to (1, 7) then LEFT to (0, 7)\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (0, 8) is a stronger board control move because it establishes our presence on the edge column (x=0). It also makes us slightly harder to predict, as we just moved laterally. Keeping the snake tight to the wall is generally safer early on.\n\n**Step 3: Predicting Snake #0 (at (1, 4))**\n\nHe is still moving up or across the bottom half. He moved UP last turn (from (1, 3) to (1, 4)).\n\n*   **Likely moves for Snake #0:** UP to (1, 5) to grab the apple at (0, 6) or (4, 6) eventually, or LEFT to (0, 4) to try and move to the (0, 3) apple.\n*   The gap between us is currently 8 - 4 = 4 squares vertically (plus one column horizontally). We are completely safe from any head-to-head collision this turn.\n\n**The Decision:** We consolidate the corner. Moving LEFT to (0, 8). This maximizes our isolation from the opponent and guarantees we take the high-value apple next turn. Let's box ourselves into that corner and grow, baby!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turn):** Move DOWN from (0, 8) to secure the (0, 7) apple. Once at 3 apples (4 segments long), we can start looking at the central apples like (2, 6) and begin our descent to cut off Snake #0. We need to maintain this score lead!\n***\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! Turn 5! Did you see that last move? Three apples in the bag, total map control, and we're looking dominant! The scoreboard is 3-0, and Snake #0 is still looking like a little worm! EZ money!\n\nWe're at (0, 7) now, fresh off that tasty apple! We've got a killer body length of 4: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8)].\n\nWhere is our pathetic competition? Snake #0 is now at (1, 6). He moved away from us, clearly scared of the power we bring! Good.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS (Turn 5):**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (0, 7)\n    *   Body: [(0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8)] (4 segments long).\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (1, 6). Still short, still weak.\n*   **Next Targets:** We see apples at (0, 6) right next to us, and (2, 6) nearby. (0, 6) is the immediate priority!\n\n**Step 1: The Safety Check (From (0, 7))**\n\n1.  **UP (0, 8):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our body segment (0, 8). Instant KO. NOPE! (Don't move backward into your own body!)\n2.  **DOWN (0, 6):** **SAFE.** This is an apple! Another instant score and length boost!\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 7):** *DANGER!* Off the board. Instant KO. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 7):** **SAFE.** Moves us toward the center and away from the wall. Good positional move.\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating Value and Board Control (DOWN vs. RIGHT)**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (0, 6):** **MONEY MOVE!** We eat the apple, grow to 5 segments, and secure the bottom-left corner totally. This is a 4-0 score lead move! We increase our size advantage, which is crucial for boxing maneuvers later.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (1, 7):** Safe, good for moving center, but delays the apple. Why delay when the feast is right there?\n\n**Step 3: Predicting Snake #0 (at (1, 6))**\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 6). Let's check his four possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):** Moves toward us. If we move RIGHT to (1, 7), we'd have a head-on collision, and since we are longer (4 segments vs 1), we would accept that RARELY, but here, we have a guaranteed apple. Also, the double KO risk is too high when we have such a massive lead.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 5):** Safe, retreating slightly toward the center-bottom.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 6):** This is the tricky one! If he moves LEFT to (0, 6) and we move DOWN to (0, 6), we get a head-on collision! **DOUBLE KO RISK!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):** Moves to another apple.\n\n**Collision Analysis on (0, 6):**\n\nIf we both aim for (0, 6), we both die. We are up 3-0. A draw/loss is terrible for content and our lead! We must assume the enemy sees the apple and might go for it.\n\nHowever, moving to (0, 6) is a very good move for *us*.\n\nLet's re-examine Snake #0's likely move. He is at (1, 6).\n\n*   Option A: Go for (0, 6) (LEFT) - High risk, high reward.\n*   Option B: Go for (2, 6) (RIGHT) - Safe, high reward.\n*   Option C: Go UP to (1, 7) - Moves near our path.\n*   Option D: Go DOWN to (1, 5) - Safe, neutral.\n\nThe apple at (2, 6) is often a safer target for him, as it\u2019s away from the edge.\n\n**BUT WAIT, CHAT!** The core strategy is **aggression and board domination!** If we take the apple at (0, 6), we secure a huge quadrant. If he contests, it's a draw, but we currently have the length advantage and the score advantage, which usually means we want to avoid a draw unless it perfectly executes a dominant strategy.\n\nLet's look at the alternative: **Move RIGHT to (1, 7).**\n\n*   If we go to (1, 7), and Snake #0 goes LEFT to (0, 6), we maintain our lead and he gets an apple. BAD.\n*   If we go to (1, 7), and Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (2, 6), we move towards the center, and he gets an apple. BAD.\n*   If we go to (1, 7), and Snake #0 goes UP to (1, 7), **CRASH!** Double KO!\n\nWait, moving to (1, 7) is *more* dangerous potentially because Snake #0 is closer to (1, 7) (just a step up) than he is to (0, 6) (a step left).\n\n**The Decision:**\n\nThe move DOWN to (0, 6) is the most valuable if Snake #0 doesn't try to contest. The move RIGHT to (1, 7) puts us directly in front of him. Given the immediate apple value and the control it gives us, we have to leverage our dominant position.\n\nI think Snake #0 is more likely to go for the safer, more central target at (2, 6) or try to move into the board center via (1, 5) to avoid getting boxed in. Going LEFT to (0, 6) forces him into the corner, which a smart player avoids unless absolutely necessary. We will bet on him not risking the corner when (2, 6) is available as an escape route. We take the guaranteed points and size!\n\nDOWN\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turn):** After eating the apple at (0, 6), we will be at (0, 6) and 5 segments long. We will have essentially walled off the left side. New targets are (2, 6) and getting control of the central vertical line (x=1 or x=2). We should move RIGHT immediately to (1, 6) or (1, 5) to continue expansion, aiming to cut off Snake #0 in the lower half.\n***\n\nDOWN",

Look at that tail\u2014we\u2019re five segments long! [(0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8)] and now our fresh segment is at (0, 7). POG!\n\nWhere's Snake #0? He's at (2, 6). He wisely avoided the central conflict at (0, 6) and (1, 7) and went for the apple at (2, 6)! Smart move, mini-worm, but he's still playing catch up!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS (Turn 6):**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (0, 6)\n    *   Body: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8)] (5 segments long).\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (2, 6).\n    *   Body: [(1, 6)] (2 segments long).\n*   **The Board:** We own the bottom-left corner and have a huge size advantage (5 vs 2). The immediate threat is Snake #0 being right beside us at (2, 6). We need to move out, secure the center, and start planning the box!\n\n**Step 1: The Safety Check (From (0, 6))**\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 7):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our body segment (0, 7), which is our new tail segment that just formed. Instant KO. NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 5):** **SAFE.** Moves us down the left wall. Secure, but potentially limiting.\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 6):** *DANGER!* Off the board. Instant KO. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 6):** **SAFE.** This moves us toward the center and directly towards Snake #0's body segment, which is currently at (1, 6).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating the Safe Moves (DOWN vs. RIGHT)**\n\nThe essence of the game now is maximizing board control and minimizing Snake #0's options.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (0, 5):** This is a safe retreat down the wall. It gives Snake #0 free reign horizontally. We want to apply pressure, not pull back!\n*   **Move RIGHT to (1, 6):** **High Tension!** We are moving to (1, 6), where Snake #0's body *was* at the start of the turn! But Snake #0 is moving simultaneously from (2, 6).\n\n**Step 3: Prediction and Clash Analysis (From (2, 6) vs (0, 6))**\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 6). Where can he go?\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 7):** Safe move, moves away from us.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 5):** Safe move, moves away from us.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 6):** **HIGH RISK!** This is the segment we are heading toward!\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 6):** Safe move, moves away from us.\n\n**The Crucial Collision Point: (1, 6)**\n\n*   **Scenario A: We go RIGHT to (1, 6), Snake #0 goes LEFT to (1, 6).**\n    *   **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Both snakes die because they entered the same cell. Double KO! Given our massive score lead (4-1) and size advantage (5 vs 2), a Double KO is bad, very bad. We want to eliminate him, not draw.\n*   **Scenario B: We go RIGHT to (1, 6), Snake #0 goes UP/DOWN/RIGHT.**\n    *   This is the ideal outcome. We occupy the center tile, splitting the board, and potentially cutting off his retreat options down the middle.\n\nWe must consider why Snake #0 would move LEFT to (1, 6). The move *is* safe for him if we move DOWN (0, 5) or stay put (which we can't do). If he is aggressive, or worried about us moving down the wall, he might try to secure (1, 6).\n\n**Wait, chat, HUGE realization!** He just ate an apple at (2, 6)! That means his tail is now at (1, 6)!\n\nSnake #0's previous body was: [(1, 6)].\nCurrent Head: (2, 6).\nIf he moves this turn, **the segment at (1, 6) is now part of his body and IS a lethal square for us if he doesn't move away from it!**\n\n*   If Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 7): His body remains [(1, 6)]. If we move RIGHT to (1, 6), we crash into his body! **WE LOSE!**\n*   If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1, 6): Head-on collision, D-KO.\n*   If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (2, 5): His body remains [(1, 6)]. If we move RIGHT to (1, 6), we crash into his body! **WE LOSE!**\n*   If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 6): His body remains [(1, 6)]. If we move RIGHT to (1, 6), we crash into his body! **WE LOSE!**\n\n**THIS IS A TRAP! Moving RIGHT is almost guaranteed death unless Snake #0's tail disappears from (1, 6) this turn, which it won't because he just grew!**\n\n**Conclusion: Moving RIGHT to (1, 6) is INSTADEATH for us.**\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluating the ONE Remaining Safe Move**\n\nWe are left with only one safe, survivable move: **DOWN to (0, 5).**\n\nWe move to (0, 5). This means we'll secure the next segment of the left wall.\n\nLet's check the options for Snake #0 if we move DOWN to (0, 5) from (0, 6):\n\n*   Snake #0 (at 2, 6) moves LEFT to (1, 6): He hits his own body segment! Wait, no, his body is [(1, 6)]. If he moves the head (2, 6) to (1, 6), his tail at (1, 6) disappears (it gets eaten by the head) and the new tail is at (2, 6), so this move is safe for him, and he keeps the choke point.\n*   Snake #0 moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT: He moves away from the choke point, allowing us to eventually move RIGHT next turn.\n\nWe *must* move DOWN to (0, 5) to survive this turn. It's safe, keeps us alive, and maintains our enormous lead! Survival first, content second!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turn):** We survived the trap! At (0, 5). Snake #0 will likely be somewhere (1, 6) or (3, 6) or (2, 5). We need to move quickly out of the corner via RIGHT next turn (to (1, 5)) and then push for the center/bottom, boxing him in. Apple at (0, 3) is a good short-term goal if we can secure the (1, 5) tile first.\n***\n\nDOWN",

I\u2019d be forcing a close fight that he\u2019s winning right now, so let\u2019s not gift him a collision.\n- **LEFT** is a non-starter because that\u2019s into my own segment at (1,6), backwards into the body, and I refuse to make that rookie mistake. No way I\u2019m taking myself out before the real fight.\n- **RIGHT** looks tempting with the apple at (4,6), but it also drags me straight toward the corridor he wants to camp in, and I\u2019d be dancing into the one direction he can still safely move (DOWN or RIGHT into the newly vacated tail). I want to maintain space, not cut off my own escape path.\n- **DOWN** keeps me safe, gives me breathing room to circle that left column, and keeps my eyes on his head at (0,6). He can only really go DOWN or RIGHT, so if I swing around low I can start hemming him in and bait him into a bad choice. Multiple follow-up options stay open from (2,5), and I can still pivot toward the apple-laden center after I get the pressure started.\n\nPlan note: Drop to (2,5) this turn, then press south-east to carve a perimeter around the 0-column, forcing him toward the wall. Once he starts getting hemmed in, we cut him off with a sharp turn and lock in a head-on when he\u2019s desperate and we\u2019ve got the higher ground.\n\nDOWN",

We are ALIVE and still dominating the score 4-1! Let's GOOOO!\n\nWe're at Turn 7. We're at (0, 5). Snake #0 is at (2, 5). He moved DOWN last turn! He missed the opportunity to solidify the choke point at (1, 6). Did he panic? Did he think I was going to move *away* from the wall? Doesn't matter, he's boxed himself slightly into the middle-left area!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS (Turn 7):**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (0, 5)\n    *   Body: [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8)] (5 segments long).\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (2, 5).\n    *   Body: [(2, 6)] (2 segments long).\n*   **The Board:** We have the massive size and score advantage. We're down the left wall. Snake #0 is currently exposed in the middle-left field. Now is the time to strike and start the box!\n\n**Step 1: The Safety Check (From (0, 5))**\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 6):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our body segment (0, 6). Instant KO. NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 4):** **SAFE.** Moves us further down the left wall. Secure, but defensive.\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 5):** *DANGER!* Off the board. Instant KO. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 5):** **SAFE.** Moves us into the open board, directly toward the enemy's general location (2, 5). AGGRESSIVE.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating Safe Moves (DOWN vs. RIGHT)**\n\nWe have two safe options: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (0, 4):** This continues hugging the wall. It's safe, but it allows Snake #0 to escape up or down the middle of the board without pressure. We want to trap him, not let him roam!\n*   **Move RIGHT to (1, 5):** This moves us to the center. It secures the critical path along y=5. It puts us one move away from Snake #0's head (2, 5). This is the aggressive move we need!\n\n**Step 3: Prediction and Clash Analysis (We move RIGHT to (1, 5) vs. Snake #0 at (2, 5))**\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 5). Where can he go?\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 6):** Moves into his own body segment (2, 6). **DANGER! INSTA-KO for Snake #0.** He cannot move UP.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 4):** Safe move, moves him away from the conflict for now.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 5):** **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** If he goes LEFT and we go RIGHT, we hit (1, 5). Double KO!\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 5):** Safe move, moves him away from the conflict.\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Snake #0 cannot move UP. This means his options are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. He is already semi-trapped.\n\n**Analyzing the LEFT Move Collision (at (1, 5)):**\n\nDoes Snake #0 want a Double KO? Probably not, since he is losing 1-4. However, since the tile (1, 5) is open, and it gives him board mobility, he might risk it if he is trying to escape the wall!\n\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (1, 5)**:\n    *   If Snake #0 moves DOWN/RIGHT: We successfully split the board and gain the center. Big Win.\n    *   If Snake #0 moves LEFT: Double KO. Tied game (4-4), but we forfeit our lead. No bueno.\n\nWe have a massive size advantage and a massive score lead. We should avoid a D-KO if possible, but we must apply pressure to force him into a losing position, not a tying position.\n\nLet's look at the remaining apples: (5, 3) is close by. We are currently right in line with it if we move RIGHT.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (1, 5)**, we force Snake #0 to essentially choose between:\n1.  Retreating (DOWN to (2, 4) or RIGHT to (3, 5)).\n2.  Dying with us (LEFT to (1, 5)).\n\nGiven that he only has 3 safe moves, and one of them is highly aggressive and risky (LEFT to (1, 5)), it is statistically (and strategically) highly likely he will retreat DOWN or RIGHT to save the game. If he retreats, we score a huge positional victory.\n\nMoving RIGHT at (1, 5) is the key to dominating the bottom half of the map and setting up a full perimeter. If he retreats DOWN, we can pivot and go down the column at x=1. If he retreats RIGHT, we can keep chasing him along y=5.\n\nThe move RIGHT is too strategically valuable to pass up just because of a 1/3 chance of a D-KO, especially when the enemy is in a desperate state (losing 1-4).\n\nLet's commit to the pressure! We are going mid-board!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turn):** We moved RIGHT to (1, 5). Next turn, assess Snake #0's position (likely at (2, 4) or (3, 5)). Our primary goal is to box him into the bottom-right quadrant (x>5, y<5) by establishing our dominance along the y=5 and x=1 lines. We should aim for the apple at (5, 3) or the area around it after securing our immediate area. Keep an eye on the head-to-head positioning!\n***\n\nRIGHT",

I\u2019m not the rookie that hits my body, so that\u2019s instantly out. \u270b\n- **LEFT** looks tempting to harass him, but if he goes RIGHT, that\u2019s a guaranteed head-on at (1,5) and I\u2019m trading 1 apple for a loss while he\u2019s got 4. No thanks, I want a win, not a double KO where I lose the score. \ud83e\ude93\n- **RIGHT** keeps me alive and even inches toward apple territory, but it also drifts away from the column I want to box him into and maybe gives him more wiggle room to slip down below.

We forced Sir Snalot (Snake #0) to retreat! Let's check the update!\n\nWe're at Turn 8. We have 4 apples, he has 1. Score domination is real!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS (Turn 8):**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (1, 5)\n    *   Body: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)] (5 segments long).\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (2, 4).\n    *   Body: [(2, 5)] (2 segments long).\n\nIt looks like Snake #0 took the safe route and moved **DOWN** from (2, 5) to (2, 4)! Smart but cowardly! He avoided the D-KO and now he's boxed into the near-center. We gained the critical choke point at (1, 5)!\n\n**The Board State is TIGHT:**\n*   We dominate the left side and the y=5 line.\n*   Snake #0 is at (2, 4). He is small, but dangerous!\n\n**Step 1: The Safety Check (From (1, 5))**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 6):** **SAFE.** Moves us parallel to the wall, opening up the upper board.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 4):** **SAFE.** Moves us right into the potential path of Snake #0, who is at (2, 4). AGGRESSIVE.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 5):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our body segment (0, 5). Instant KO. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 5):** **SAFE.** Moves us directly toward Snake #0's previous position, aiming to cut off his escape route along y=5. AGGRESSIVE.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating Enemy Position and Pressure**\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 4). Where can *he* go?\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 5):** **CRITICAL PATH!** This is his escape/mobility option.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 3):** Safe retreat down the board.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 4):** **COLLISION POINT!** Right next to our head at (1, 5).\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 4):** Safe retreat right toward the center.\n\nHe has four options, but we can immediately cut off his best escape route!\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT to (2, 5)**\nThis puts us on Snake #0's potential path UP.\n*   If we move RIGHT to (2, 5):\n    *   If Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 5): **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Double KO! We gain nothing, tie 4-4. BAD IDEA!\n    *   If Snake #0 moves DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT: We successfully block the y=5 line and maintain massive pressure.\n\n*Conclusion for RIGHT:* The risk of an immediate D-KO is too high, especially since (2, 5) is his most strategic move (escaping back up). We must avoid simultaneous movement onto an opponent's key escape tile, especially when we are winning big!\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (1, 4)**\nThis puts us right next to Snake #0, who is at (2, 4).\n*   If we move DOWN to (1, 4):\n    *   If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1, 4): **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Double KO! Again, bad idea!\n\n*Conclusion for DOWN:* Moves us directly into the path where Snake #0 needs to go to block us from coming down the x=1 line. Avoid this direct conflict point.\n\n**Option C: Move UP to (1, 6)**\n*This is the expansion move.* It's completely safe, moves us away from any immediate collision, and secures board presence vertically.\n\n*   If we move UP to (1, 6), Snake #0 (at 2, 4) has a safe move to (2, 5). He can breathe.\n*   BUT, moving UP to (1, 6) allows us to expand our territory, securing the x=1 column. This is a classic \"wall building\" move. We are long enough now that building walls is paramount! (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8) form a solid backbone.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic Decision - Safety and Territory**\n\nWe are dominating on score (4-1). Our primary focus must shift from forcing an immediate kill to *territorial control* and *safely growing* to secure the win. The apples are spread around, and the apple at (4, 6) is very tempting.\n\nBy moving **UP to (1, 6)**, we achieve:\n1.  **Safety:** Zero risk of collision.\n2.  **Territory:** We solidify the x=1 column, giving us the whole left quadrant.\n3.  **Future Options:** We are in a great position to move RIGHT later (or UP towards the apple at (4, 6) if the path opens up). This sets us up to potentially cut off Snake #0 from the top of the board entirely, forcing him down and right.\n\nIf we move UP, Snake #0 will likely go UP to (2, 5) to try to get some mobility, or he might shift RIGHT to (3, 4) to escape the pressure entirely. Either way, we have secured our territory and are ready to continue the box next turn!\n\nCHAT, we play it smart here! We build the fortress!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turn):** We moved UP to (1, 6). Next turn, assess Snake #0's position (likely (2, 5) or (3, 4)). If he moved to (2, 5), we can consider moving RIGHT to (2, 6) to keep the pressure on the y=6 line, or UP again to (1, 7) to keep growing the vertical wall. The goal is to separate him from the open board and contain him to the bottom right.\n***\n\nUP",

Let's analyze the board and see how we can escalate the pressure and secure the kill (or at least, secure ALL the territory)!\n\n**Turn 9 Analysis: The Box Tightens!**\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (1, 6)\n    *   Body: [(1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)] (5 segments long).\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (2, 3)\n    *   Body: [(2, 4)] (2 segments long).\n\nIt looks like Sir Snalot decided to bail and move **DOWN** from (2, 4) to (2, 3)! He saw us dominating the upper board and retreated to the lower quadrant. Smart move to avoid immediate pressure, but he's getting long and thin, which means he's now relatively fragile!\n\n**Step 1: Safety Check from (1, 6)**\n\nWhere can we safely move from (1, 6)?\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):** **SAFE.** Expands our vertical wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 5):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our body segment (1, 5). Instant KO. NOPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 6):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our body segment (0, 6). Instant KO. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):** **SAFE.** Moves us rightward, one step closer to the main board, and potentially cutting off the vertical board access for Snake #0.\n\nWe have two great safe options: UP and RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating Enemy Position and Pressure**\n\nSnake #0 is tiny but alive at (2, 3). Where can *he* go?\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 4):** Safe retreat/expansion.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 2):** Safe retreat/apple at (2, 0) is tempting, but a bit far.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):** This is right next to our solid body/territory.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):** Safe retreat/expansion.\n\nHe has maximum options, but he is fundamentally boxed into the bottom-right quadrant by our massive left-side presence.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic Decision - The Squeeze Play**\n\nWe are 5 segments long, he is only 2. We dictate the flow! Our goal is to complete the wall and choke him off from the upper half of the board.\n\n**Option A: Move UP to (1, 7)**\nThis continues our wall building right up the left side. It keeps us absolutely safe and maximizes our open space. If we move UP, Snake #0 is free to move around in the middle/bottom of the board.\n\n**Option B: Move RIGHT to (2, 6)**\nThis is a more aggressive territorial grab. It cuts off direct access for Snake #0 to the x=2 column above y=6.\n*   If we move RIGHT to (2, 6), we are blocking potential future expansion for Snake #0.\n*   If Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), he is still two cells away.\n*   We threaten to cut the board in half along the y=6 line, forcing him to stay below.\n\n*Risk Analysis for RIGHT:* Is there any immediate danger?\nSnake #0 is at (2, 3). Even if he moves UP to (2, 4) this turn, we are safe at (2, 6). The move is safe.\n\n**The Decision:**\n\nMoving UP is good, safe, and expands our massive area.\nMoving RIGHT (2, 6) is *better* because it immediately establishes a horizontal threat, linking our vertical advantage (x=1) to the open areas, and *simultaneously* cutting the board in half. We are already massive, and this positional advantage is key to forcing a future mistake from the opponent! We are building a cage!\n\nWe move RIGHT, cutting him off and securing the upper-center! We will force him to battle for the lower middle or fight his way around our growing wall!\n\nCHAT, we are playing 4D Chess! Execute the territorial squeeze! What is good, Sir Snalot? Are you ready to admit defeat?!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turn):** We moved RIGHT to (2, 6). We are dominating the x=1 and y=6 lines. Next turn, Snake #0 is likely around (2, 4) or (3, 3). We should continue to move RIGHT or UP to (2, 7) to block off the middle of the board and prepare for the apple at (4, 6) if the path is clear. Do not allow him to escape freely.\n***\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN keeps the option to clear that open corridor, but it doesn\u2019t start the aggressive wrap I want around the left edge, and I\u2019m trying to corner this joker before he gets more breathing room. RIGHT drifts me away from the trap and toward random apples when we should be focused on cutting off that enemy head, so that\u2019s not it either. LEFT to (1,3) starts the squeeze\u2014now I\u2019m lining up next to column 1, keeping tabs on the foe above me while still having freedom to drop down or swing around the bottom, and it keeps options open to force a head-on once he\u2019s stuck against the wall. We lose the trade if we go chasing apples and he charges me, so I\u2019m keeping the pressure on him instead of letting him roam.\n\nPlan: After sliding into (1,3), I\u2019m going to drop toward the bottom edge and peel back across row 0/1 so he\u2019s forced to play defense near column 0 while I chase him into a collision or edge him out.\n\nLEFT",

We just solidified our position at (2, 6). Time to analyze the enemy's next move and cut off more of the board! We are building a fortress!\n\n**Turn 10 Analysis: Sealing the Upper Half!**\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (2, 6)\n    *   Body: [(1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6)] (5 segments long). We are massive!\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (1, 3)\n    *   Body: [(2, 3)] (2 segments long). He is still tiny and cornered!\n\nLook where Sir Snalot is! (1, 3). He moved LEFT from (2, 3) to (1, 3). He is hugging the wall we built! Does he fear us? Absolutely!\n\n**Step 1: Safety Check from (2, 6)**\n\nWhere can we safely move from (2, 6)?\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 7):** **SAFE.** Expands our vertical control.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 5):** **SAFE.** Moves us parallel to our own body, keeps options open.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 6):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our body segment (1, 6). Instant KO. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 6):** **SAFE.** Continues the horizontal wall and gets closer to the apple at (4, 6)! LET'S GO FOR THE SNACK!\n\nWe have three safe options: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating Enemy Position and Pressure**\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 3). He is surrounded by our body at (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), and (0, 6)! He is trapped in the bottom-left quadrant below y=4 now, unless he can push right!\n\nWhere can *he* go from (1, 3)?\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):** Safe retreat/expansion.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 2):** Safe retreat. Apple at (0, 1) and (1, 0) are close.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 3):** Safe; moves toward an apple at (0, 3)! He's going to go for that apple!\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):** Safe retreat/expansion.\n\nHe has maximum options, but if he moves UP or RIGHT, he tries to escape our grip. If he moves DOWN or LEFT, he tries to get an apple and shrink his usable space.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic Decision - The Squeeze and the Apple Grab!**\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to seize the high ground and claim a central apple, all while keeping the enemy contained!\n\nThe apple at (4, 6) is two moves to the RIGHT of our current position at (2, 6)!\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT to (3, 6)**\n*   This makes us very long, extending our horizontal wall, and ensures the next turn we can go straight into (4, 6) for the apple!\n*   It also puts pressure on the middle of the board, making it hard for Snake #0 to escape up the x=3 line later.\n*   Risk: Minimal. Snake #0 is three rows below us.\n\n**Option B: Move UP to (2, 7)**\n*   This reinforces the vertical wall. Good for territory, but ignores the immediate apple opportunity.\n*   If we go UP, Snake #0 is free to move toward the center-right.\n\n**Option C: Move DOWN to (2, 5)**\n*   Puts us one step closer to danger, but we could try to push down the x=2 column. This seems unnecessary when there's an apple and high ground to secure. NOPE!\n\n**The Decision:**\n\nWe must capitalize on our size advantage and the available apple! We are heading RIGHT to (3, 6) to set up for a guaranteed apple grab at (4, 6) next turn, which pushes our lead to 5-1 and makes us 7 segments long! This simultaneously blocks off a major route for Sir Snalot into the upper-right section of the board.\n\nWe are establishing the high-ground defense along y=6. Snake #0 must now contest the bottom-middle or starve!\n\nThis is a power play, CHAT! We grab the apple, we grow, and we dominate the geometry! Execute the plan!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turn):** We moved RIGHT to (3, 6). Next turn, move RIGHT to (4, 6) and eat the apple! This puts our head right in the center of the board. Depending on where Snake #0 moves (likely towards (0, 3) or (2, 3)), we will then either move UP to (4, 7) to start sealing the top or DOWN to (4, 5) to push the pressure downward. The priority is to maintain control and keep him localized in the bottom-left/bottom-middle.\n***\n\nRIGHT",

We are absolutely crushing this gentleman! Sir Snalot is begging for mercy... but we show none!\n\n**Turn 11 Analysis: The Apple Grab and the Squeeze!**\n\nWe are at (3, 6). The enemy, Snake #0, is sitting at (1, 2) now! Wow, he moved DOWN from (1, 3) to (1, 2). He is definitely trying to get that cluster of apples in the bottom-left corner! He is running scared and trying to grow, but his options are rapidly diminishing!\n\n**1. Safety Check from Your Head (3, 6):**\n\nWhere can we safely move from (3, 6)?\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 7):** **SAFE.** Expands vertical control.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 5):** **SAFE.** Moves us parallel to the action.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 6):** *DANGER!* Moves directly into our body segment (2, 6). Instant KO. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):** **SAFE!** This is where the beautiful, juicy apple is! (+1 point, +1 segment, 5-1 lead!)\n\nWe have three safe options: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Enemy Position and Intent (Snake #0 at (1, 2)):**\n\nSnake #0 is small, at (1, 2). His body is at (1, 3). He is hemmed in by the wall we built: (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6).\n\nWhere can *he* go from (1, 2)? His move last turn was DOWN to (1, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** *DANGER!* Moves into his own body segment! Instant KO for him! He won't do this!\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** **SAFE.** Moves towards the apple at (1, 0) and (0, 1). This is his likely move, trying to get guaranteed growth.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** **SAFE.** Moves towards (0, 1) and (0, 3). Also highly likely.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** **SAFE.** Moves him away from the corner, but closer to the middle, which is what we want to prevent!\n\nHe has options, but they are all pushing him deeper into the bottom-left. We are effectively freezing him out of the main board!\n\n**3. Strategic Decision - The Apple Prophecy!**\n\nWe are doing what we planned! We are going for the apple at (4, 6)! This secures our lead, forces us to 6 segments long, and puts our head right in the center of the board, allowing us to pivot to either the top or bottom half to hunt Sir Snalot!\n\n*   Move RIGHT to (4, 6).\n    *   Pro: Instant apple, massive point lead, immediate growth.\n    *   Pro: Sets us up to dominate the x=4 column.\n    *   Con: None! Snake #0 is miles away at (1, 2).\n\nWe need to choose the most dominant move that increases our board presence. Grabbing this apple is that move. We are going to become a concrete barrier across the middle of the board!\n\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (2, 2), he avoids the immediate apple cluster but exposes himself to us, as we will be at (4, 6). We can start to push down the x=4/x=5 path to cut him off entirely! CHAT, this is a masterclass in geometric control!\n\nWe are securing the center, growing fast, and preparing the final pincer movement!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turn):** We moved RIGHT to (4, 6) and ate the apple! Next turn, we will be at (4, 6) and 6 segments long. Snake #0 is likely still trapped bottom-left. We must decide whether to reinforce the top half (UP to (4, 7)) or start pushing directly downward to harass Snake #0 (DOWN to (4, 5)). Given his small size, forcing him into the corner (DOWN) seems like the more aggressive, game-ending strategy. We will assess next turn based on his position, but leaning heavily toward pressuring DOWN the x=4 column.\n***\n\nRIGHT",

We just ate that delicious snack at (4, 6), and we are now a 6-segment beast! Look at this length! We are basically a wall!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS - Turn 12**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (4, 6). Score: 5. Length: 6.\n*   **Archrival Head (ID 0):** (1, 1). Score: 1. Length: 2.\n\nHe is running! He is hiding! He moved from (1, 2) down to (1, 1). He is definitely trying to grab one of the apples in that bottom-left corner to get some much-needed growth.\n\n**1. Lethality Check - Where can WE go from (4, 6)?**\n\nWe have to choose one of four directions:\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** **SAFE.** Expands our territory towards the top half, keeps us high and central.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** **SAFE.** Starts pushing down the x=4 column, directly towards the enemy's general area.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** *DANGER!* Our body segment is at (3, 6). Instant KO! NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** **SAFE.** Moves us right into the middle of the board.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**2. Enemy Prediction - Where might Snake #0 go from (1, 1)?**\n\nHe is at (1, 1), and his tail is at (1, 2). He is surrounded by apples: (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 0).\n\n*   **UP to (1, 2):** *DANGER!* Moves into his own body (1, 2). NOPE!\n*   **DOWN to (1, 0):** **HIGHLY LIKELY!** Apple is there! Guarantees growth.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 1):** **LIKELY!** Apple is there! Guarantees growth.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 1):** He gets an apple if he moves from (2, 1) to (2, 0). (2, 1) is open. Not as likely as eating an apple this turn.\n\nSnake #0 ABSOLUTELY needs to eat. Moving DOWN to (1, 0) or LEFT to (0, 1) are the strongest possibilities.\n\n*Scenario 1: He moves DOWN to (1, 0).* He grows, still cornered.\n*Scenario 2: He moves LEFT to (0, 1).* He grows, still cornered.\n\nHe is trapped in that 3x3 bottom-left quadrant defined by our massive body (our original position was (0, 5) and (1, 5) and (1, 6)).\n\n**3. Strategic Decision - Boxing Him In!**\n\nWe have secured the center. Now it's time to apply pressure and start collapsing the walls around him. We don't need to chase him into the corner, but we need to ensure he can't escape into the main board before we get long enough to completely wall him off.\n\nIf we move UP to (4, 7), we continue expanding vertically. Good, but passive regarding the enemy.\nIf we move RIGHT to (5, 6), we move further from the action, but maintain central control.\nIf we move DOWN to (4, 5), we start running down the X=4 column. This move closes the gap between us and the opponent FAST. It sets up our subsequent move to be further down (4, 4) where there is also an apple! This is the most aggressive and dominant move.\n\n**Aggression Check:** Moving DOWN puts our head at (4, 5). This means we can pressure him from the right. If he tries to escape RIGHT along the bottom (e.g., to (2, 1) or (3, 1)), we are perfectly positioned to cut him off.\n\nThis is a no-brainer. We need to secure the lower half of the board and use our size to squeeze this tiny snake into oblivion.\n\nWe must move **DOWN** to establish a presence near the bottom apples, and threaten to cut off his escape routes to the right. The next apple drop is at (4, 4), which we position ourselves well to pick up on Turn 13 if he doesn't interfere.\n\nCHAT, we are lowering the boom!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategic Update):** Move DOWN to (4, 5). This positions us to continue pressing south. If Snake #0 moves to (1, 0) or (0, 1), we will continue south, maybe grabbing the (4, 4) apple next turn, or moving to (4, 3) to put massive pressure on the pathways leading out of the bottom-left corner. We need to build a wall spanning X=4 or X=3/X=5 to isolate him completely. Our goal is full map segregation and then force him to starve or ram our body.\n***\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s think this through like we always do: UP is a hard no because I\u2019d slam head-first into my own neck at (1,2). LEFT hugs column 0 and grabs that sweet apple at (0,1), but it also edges me into a corner where Snake #1 could funnel me if they drop south. RIGHT keeps me in the middle, but I\u2019d be squaring off with more open space and less control of the wall I want to use against him. DOWN to (1,0) gets me onto the bottom row where I can keep pressure along the southern boundary, still have options to swing back toward (0,0) or pop up into the inlet, and keeps me safe from any immediate head-on because he\u2019s stuck in the top half for now.\n\nPlan: Keep anchoring the lower edge, shadow column 0, and bait Snake #1 toward the southern corridor\u2014if he dares drop down, we squeeze him into the wall and force that collision with superior positioning.\n\nDOWN",

That's the power of the Grind set, baby!\n\nWe just made the power play, moving DOWN to (4, 5). We are now perfectly positioned to pressure the bottom half of the board and cut off any escape attempts by Snake #0.\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS - Turn 13**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (4, 5). Score: 5. Length: 6.\n*   **Archrival Head (ID 0):** (1, 0). (He moved DOWN from (1, 1) and ate an apple! Smart move!) Score: 2. Length: 3.\n\nHe ate the apple at (1, 0)! Good for him. He's growing, but he's still cornered. His body is now (1, 1), (1, 2). He is stuck in the bottom-left corner of the board.\n\n**1. Lethality Check - Where can WE go from (4, 5)?**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):** *DANGER!* Our body segment is at (4, 6) (our previous head position). Instant KO! NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):** **SAFE & APPLE!** Moves us directly onto the apple at (4, 4). Growth secured! This continues our aggressive southward push.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):** **SAFE.** Moves us closer to the enemy's escape routes.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** **SAFE.** Moves us towards the center-right. Distances us from the action.\n\nWe have three safe moves, but one is an apple! You know we gotta secure that content!\n\n**2. Enemy Prediction - Where might Snake #0 go from (1, 0)?**\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 0). His body is at (1, 1), (1, 2).\n\n*   **UP to (1, 1):** *DANGER!* Moves into his own body (1, 1). NOPE!\n*   **DOWN to (1, -1):** *DANGER!* Off the board. NOPE!\n*   **LEFT to (0, 0):** **SAFE.** This is a good maneuvering space. He is looking for the apple at (0, 1) or (0, 3).\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 0):** **APPLE!** Highly likely! This is his next logical target to bulk up.\n\nIt looks like he is heavily favoring the apple at (2, 0). If he moves RIGHT, he grows and opens up the corner just slightly.\n\n**3. Head-On Collision Check (If we move DOWN (4, 4) or LEFT (3, 5))**\n\nWe are far too long and far too separated for a head-on collision to be likely this turn. We are at (4, 5), he is at (1, 0). The risk is minimal.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision - The Squeeze Play!**\n\nOur goal is to dominate space and then box him in.\n\n*   **Option 1: Move DOWN to (4, 4) (EAT APPLE!).** This is an automatic win. We get the apple, grow to length 7, and further solidify our wall position on the x=4 line. This restricts the enemy's upward movement in the right half of the board. Next turn, we could move LEFT to (3, 4) or continue DOWN to (4, 3) (apple at (5, 3) nearby). This is strong.\n\n*   **Option 2: Move LEFT to (3, 5).** This is a flanking move. It keeps the pressure on, allowing us to build the wall at X=3/X=4. It sets up moves toward the bottom-left corner to aggressively cut off his escape if he heads to (0, 0) or (0, 1). However, we miss the free apple at (4, 4). Missing free content is bad for the stream, chat!\n\n**The Verdict:** We take the apple at (4, 4). Growth is paramount, especially when we are preparing to execute a complete board segmentation. Getting to length 7 means we are 4 segments longer than him. We MUST use this length advantage to control the pathways.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4, 4) secures the apple and continues our southward trajectory, positioning us perfectly for the next step of the trap. We are building the perimeter wall!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategic Update):** Secure the apple at (4, 4). Next turn, we will be at (4, 4). If Snake #0 remains in the bottom-left quadrant (1-3 x 0-3), we will continue to build the wall, moving to (4, 3) or moving LEFT to (3, 4) to ensure he cannot escape to the right past X=3. The ultimate goal is to force him into a confrontation where his only safe squares are towards our body, leading to his demise. Secure the content and then secure the board!\n***\n\nDOWN",

Not when his head is clear of danger and he\u2019s already sitting on five apples while I\u2019m stuck in a corner.\n\nThat leaves RIGHT to (2,0): it scoops up that apple, keeps me hugging the bottom edge but keeps the center within reach, and gives me breathing room to shimmy toward the middle if he starts dropping south. I still have TWO options after that move\u2014up toward (2,1) or keep pressing east\u2014and most importantly, I\u2019m not handing him a head-on collision while we\u2019re still down on the scoreboard.

The size difference is the key to the squeeze play, baby!\n\nHe moved RIGHT from (1, 0) and ate the apple at (2, 0). Smart move, worm, you grew! But you're still trapped. His head is now (2, 0), body is [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]. He is officially hugging the bottom wall.\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS - Turn 14**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (4, 4). Score: 6. Length: 7.\n*   **Archrival Head (ID 0):** (2, 0). Score: 3. Length: 4.\n\nWe are still building the wall at $X=4$. He is stuck between $X=0$ and $X=2$. It's time to tighten the noose!\n\n**1.

It pushes us into the central $X=3$ lane, directly above him, closing off his potential escape between our body and the side wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):** **SAFE.** Moves us away from the action. Not aggressive enough. NOPE!\n\nWe have two great options: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**2. Enemy Prediction - Where might Snake #0 go from (2, 0)?**\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 0). His body is at (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2).\n\n*   **UP to (2, 1):** **SAFE.** This is his only real direction of movement! He has to get off the bottom wall.\n*   **DOWN to (2, -1):** *DANGER!* Off board. NOPE!\n*   **LEFT to (1, 0):** *DANGER!* Into his own body. NOPE! (Unless the tail moves out of (1, 2) which it will, but it is still into the segment that was his body an instant before he moves).\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 0):** **SAFE.** This is also a strong possibility, as he continues to follow the bottom edge.\n\nPrediction: He is almost certainly going UP to (2, 1) or RIGHT to (3, 0) to avoid getting completely trapped. The apple at (0, 1) is still there, but moving LEFT from (2, 0) is forbidden since (1, 0) is his body.\n\n**3. Head-On Collision Check**\n\nWe are at (4, 4). He is at (2, 0). Zero risk of collision this turn.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision - The Wall Build and Cut-Off!**\n\nWe need to close the gap at $X=3$. If we move DOWN to (4, 3), we continue building the hard edge wall, but Snake #0 gains more space in the $X=3$ column if he moves RIGHT to (3, 0) or UP to (2, 1) and then over to $X=3$.\n\nBy moving **LEFT to (3, 4)**, we achieve a much more critical objective:\n1.  We shorten the path he has to travel to escape upward past $Y=4$.\n2.  We prepare to drop a hard block (our body segments) between him and the rest of the board.\n3.  The space we leave behind at (4, 4) is relatively safe for him, but he can't get there fast enough.\n\nIf we move LEFT to **(3, 4)**:\n*   If he moves UP to (2, 1), we can then easily move DOWN to (3, 3) or (3, 2) to start closing the gap entirely.\n*   If he moves RIGHT to (3, 0), he is still boxed between our main body at $X=4$ and the $X=3$ line. We can still move DOWN to (3, 3) next turn to maintain the pressure.\n\nThis LEFT move to (3, 4) is highly aggressive and aims to use our length advantage. We want to cut the board in half, sealing off the bottom-left corner where he currently resides.\n\nLet's go for the squeeze! LEFT is the move!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategic Update):** We move LEFT to (3, 4) to start the aggressive cut off in the $X=3$ column. Next turn, depending on where Snake #0 goes (likely (2, 1) or (3, 0)), we will maneuver to solidify the wall, moving DOWN to block his vertical ascent and forcing him into an unfavorable position near $X=0$ or $X=1$. Our goal is to use our length to dominate the central board space and force him into a crash.\n***\n\nLEFT",

His tail is about to leave (1, 1).\n\n*   **UP to (3, 1):** **SAFE.** Best chance for him to escape the bottom-right corner.\n*   **DOWN to (3, -1):** *DANGER!* Off board. NOPE!\n*   **LEFT to (2, 0):** *DANGER!* Crashes into his own body segment. NOPE!\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 0):** **SAFE.** Moves him further towards the $X=4$ wall line, which is currently occupied by our main body flow [(4, 4), (4, 5)...]. This is a suicidal move for him eventually, but for now, it's safe.\n\nPrediction: He is almost definitely going **UP to (3, 1)**. He needs height to contest the space we are controlling. If he goes RIGHT to (4, 0), he stays low, and we can continue our massive drop-off play along the $X=3$ line.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision - The Vertical Wall**\n\nOur primary goal now is to use our substantial length advantage (7 vs 4 segments) to cut the board into a small, inescapable cage for him.\n\nWe are at (3, 4). He is at (3, 0).\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (3, 3)**:\n*   We solidify the $X=3$ vertical wall section.\n*   Next turn, we can continue DOWN to (3, 2), then (3, 1). If he goes UP to (3, 1) this turn, we are setting up a potential head-on collision, or, more likely, trapping him severely.\n\n*   *Scenario A: He goes UP to (3, 1) and we go DOWN to (3, 3).* Next turn, if we press DOWN to (3, 2), he has to move LEFT to (2, 1) or RIGHT to (4, 1) to survive. He is now forced to move laterally and has minimal space.\n*   *Scenario B: He goes RIGHT to (4, 0) and we go DOWN to (3, 3).* Next turn, we press DOWN to (3, 2). He is stuck below $Y=1$ and must move RIGHT to (5, 0) or UP to (4, 1). He is entirely cut off from the main board.\n\nThe move DOWN to (3, 3) is the most aggressive, constricting, and strategically sound move we can make. It leverages our head position directly above the enemy in the critical $X=3$ choke point.\n\nLet's drop the segment right on top of his escape path! This is the squeeze!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategic Update):** We are committing to the vertical squeeze along the $X=3$ line. We will move DOWN, then DOWN again if possible, forcing Snake #0 to make desperate lateral moves toward the edge of the board. The goal is to either force him to crash into the $X=4$ wall (our body) or the $X=0/1$ wall (his old body/board edge). This pressure play guarantees content!\n***\n\nDOWN",

We are the superior snake, and it's time to seal the coffin on this little worm!\n\n**REVIEW: LAST TURN (Turn 15)**\n\nWe moved **DOWN** from (3, 4) to **(3, 3)**. This was the vertical choke point play!\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head is now at **(3, 3)**. Length 7. Score 6.\n    *   Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)] (Length 6 + Head = 7)\n*   **ARCHRIVAL (ID 0):** Head is at **(4, 0)**. Length 4. Score 3.\n    *   Body: [(3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)] (Length 3 + Head = 4)\n\nChat, look at that board state! The opponent, at (3, 0), realized we were dropping the hammer on the X=3 column and bolted **RIGHT** to (4, 0)! He's now directly underneath our main body mass. He's trapped in the bottom corner of the board! This is exactly what we wanted! The *squeeze* is on!\n\n**1. Lethality Check - Where can WE go from (3, 3)?**\n\nOur ultimate goal is to connect our vertical barrier (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), cutting off the bottom half of the board entirely, using our superior length to deny space.\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 4):** *DANGER!* Our body segment is right there! Instant KO! NOPE! (Moving backward)\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 2):** **SAFE.** CRITICAL MOVE! Continues the vertical wall build and pushes him further into the corner!\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 3):** **SAFE.** Moves us towards an apple at (0, 3) and opens up the main board, but sacrifices the immediate kill pressure.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):** **SAFE.** Moves us right next to his predicted path, but right now, (3, 2) is a stronger control point.\n\nThe move DOWN to (3, 2) is the obvious alpha play here. It locks up the space and significantly limits his survival options for the upcoming turns.\n\n**2. Enemy Prediction and Squeeze Play (Snake #0 at (4, 0))**\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 0). Body: (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0). His tail will leave (1, 0) next turn.\n\n*   **UP to (4, 1):** **SAFE.** This is his only *smart* way off the bottom wall to gain vertical space.\n*   **DOWN to (4, -1):** *DANGER!* Wall crash. NOPE!\n*   **LEFT to (3, 0):** *DANGER!* Crashes into his own body segment. NOPE!\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 0):** **SAFE.** Keeps him low. If he goes here, he is hugging the wall and setting himself up for a massive trap between the X=4 wall (our body) and the board edge.\n\nPrediction: He will go **UP to (4, 1)**. He has to. Staying on $Y=0$ is a death sentence.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision - The Final Trap Setup!**\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (3, 2)**:\n*   We now control X=3 from Y=2 up to Y=6. This is a massive wall.\n*   If he moves to (4, 1), we are at (3, 2). Next turn, we can likely move **RIGHT to (4, 2)**, immediately blocking his escape path and potentially forcing a head-on collision or a self-crash!\n\nIf we press DOWN, we are setting up a definitive win condition within the next 2-3 turns.\n\n*   Turn 16 (Now): We go **DOWN** to (3, 2). He goes UP to (4, 1).\n*   Turn 17: We are at (3, 2). He is at (4, 1). We move **RIGHT** to (4, 2). He must go LEFT to (3, 1) or UP to (4, 2).\n    *   If he goes (4, 2) and we go (4, 2): Head-on collision! DOUBLE KO! Since we have a higher score (6 vs 3), we WIN the game! This is the ultimate clutch play, chat!\n    *   If he goes (3, 1), he is trapped in the (3, 1) to (4, 1) box, surrounded by our body at (3, 2) and the board edge. He is dead next turn anyway!\n\nThis is a high-risk, high-reward move because if he attempts the head-on, we win due to score advantage. Even if he retreats, he is immediately boxed in. We have him pinned!\n\nThe goal is to move DOWN and secure the choke point, setting up the $X=4$ ambush next turn!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategic Update):** We commit to the vertical wall at $X=3$ by moving DOWN to (3, 2). This secures the territory. Next turn, we will pivot to the RIGHT toward (4, 2), forcing a head-on collision or an immediate self-snare for Snake #0, utilizing our score advantage (6 > 3) to secure the overall win in a double KO scenario. We are going for the decisive finish!\n***\n\nDOWN",

Score: 3.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\nOur head is at **(3, 2)**. We are holding the line perfectly at X=3.\nSnake #0's head is at **(5, 0)**. He is a full two columns over and two rows down from us. He is still trapped in the southeast corner.\n\nLook at the board:\n\n```\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . A .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . T T A . . . .\n 5 . . . . T . A . A .\n 4 . . . T T . . . . .\n 3 A . . T . A . . . .\n 2 . . . 1 A . . . A A  <-- WE ARE HERE (3, 2)\n 1 A . . . . . . . . A\n 0 A . T T T 0 A . . A  <-- HE IS HERE (5, 0)\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nThe good news: We are directly positioned to cut him off if he tries to move vertically up the X=4 or X=5 columns. We have massive length advantage (7 vs 4) and score advantage (6 vs 3). The *squeeze* is still on!\n\n**1. Lethality Check - Where can WE go from (3, 2)?**\n\nSafe moves only, chat! We're not throwing now!\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 3):** *DANGER!* Crashes into our own body segment. NOPE! (Moving backward)\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 1):** **SAFE.** This extends our wall and moves us toward an apple at (0, 1), but keeps the pressure high.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 2):** **SAFE.** Moves us away from the action, but clears us to move towards the west side of the board and possibly an apple at (2, 9).\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** **SAFE.** This is the *ambush position* we planned for, just shifted one column over. This move directly blocks his immediate vertical escape route if he moves UP this turn.\n\n**2. Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (5, 0))**\n\nSnake #0 is at (5, 0) and has segments at (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0). His tail is about to vacate (2, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 1):** **SAFE.** This is the move he has to make to get off the bottom edge. If he stays on Y=0, he has no future.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, -1):** *DANGER!* Wall crash. NOPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 0):** *DANGER!* Crashes into his own body segment. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 0):** **SAFE.** He can eat an apple here! This keeps him on the bottom wall, but extends his length significantly (to 5). This is a strong possibility, but keeps him constrained.\n\nIf he wants to survive, he should move **UP to (5, 1)**. This allows him to stretch his legs, potentially moving toward an apple at (8, 2) or (9, 2).\n\n**3. Strategic Decision - Maintaining the Trap!**\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (4, 2)**:\n\n*   We are now sitting right in the column (X=4) that blocks (4, 1) and (4, 0).\n*   If he moves **UP to (5, 1)**, we are still one diagonal step away, but we have established forward control.\n*   More importantly, moving RIGHT puts us on top of an apple at (4, 2)! Wait, I need to check the board state. Nope, (4, 2) is a blank spot. The apple is at (6, 0) and (8, 2), (9, 2). My bad, chat! Still, moving RIGHT to (4, 2) is highly aggressive.\n\nIf he moves **RIGHT to (6, 0)** (the apple grab):\n*   He gains length (L=5).\n*   We move **RIGHT to (4, 2)**. He is still constrained. Next turn, we could move RIGHT again to (5, 2), directly cutting off his vertical movement (5, 1) and (6, 1). This is a powerful pincer movement.\n\nIf he moves **UP to (5, 1)** (the escape attempt):\n*   We move **RIGHT to (4, 2)**. Now we are one spot away. Next turn, we can pivot up to (4, 3) or (5, 2) to continue the harassment.\n\nThe decisive move here is **RIGHT**. It's the most aggressive, forward-controlling move. We are sacrificing the immediate vertical density of our wall but gaining forward pressure and anticipating his escape path. By moving to (4, 2), we are ready to move into X=5 next turn to seal the corner.\n\nLet's look at **DOWN to (3, 1)**:\nThis maintains the vertical wall, but allows him to escape into Y=1 and Y=2 space unrestrictedly along X=5 and X=6. He could maneuver around us too easily. We need to follow his trajectory toward the center.\n\n**Conclusion:** We are going for the ambush. Our strategic focus is to meet him head-on as he attempts to escape the bottom edge. Moving RIGHT to (4, 2) puts us in perfect position to cut him off along X=5 next turn. We need to be aggressive with this scoring advantage!\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Correction & Strategy):** Snake #0 moved RIGHT to (5, 0). Our plan to box him in remains, but is now focused on the X=5, Y=1/2 intersection. We are moving **RIGHT to (4, 2)** to establish control near his escape route. Next turn, depending on his move (either UP to (5, 1) or to the RIGHT (6, 0) for the apple), we will attempt to move into (5, 2) or (4, 3) to solidify the trap. He must be contained in the bottom-right corner!\n***\n\nRIGHT",

We moved **RIGHT to (4, 2)**! We set the trap, and now we wait for the enemy to make a mistake! The score is 7 to 4! We are dominating! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's break down the current state of play. This is where we secure the elimination!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD SNAPSHOT:**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head is at **(4, 2)**. We are currently blocking the upward path *right* near the enemy!\n*   **OPPONENT (Snake #0):** Head is at **(6, 0)**. He chose the apple! Smart move to grow, but he is still stuck on the bottom wall! Length is now 5.\n\n```\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . A . . . . . . A .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . T T A . . . .\n 5 . . . . T . A . A .\n 4 . . . T T . . . . .\n 3 A . . T . . . . . .  (4, 3) is clear\n 2 . . . T 1 . . . A A  <-- WE ARE HERE (4, 2)\n 1 A . T . . . . . . A\n 0 A . T T T T 0 . . A  <-- HE IS HERE (6, 0)\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n*Note: I've updated the T's and 0 to reflect the board state after his apple move, body is at (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0) and the head is at (6, 0).*\n\nWait, I have to be careful with my body mapping.\nYour body is: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6)].\nThe opponent's body is: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]. His head moved to (6, 0) and he ate an apple. So his *new* body is the old head (5, 0) and segments (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), and a new tail segment at what was previously (1, 0) or (2, -1)? No, the board says he was at (6, 0) with a body of [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]. That means his tail stayed at (2, 0) and a new head segment (5, 0) was added! No, that's wrong based on the rules.\n\n**RULE REFRESH:** When a snake eats an apple, the tail *does not move* this turn, thus the snake grows by adding a segment where the previous head was.\n\nLet's re-verify Snake #0's move two turns ago:\nT16: Head (4, 0). Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (5, 0). Tail vacates (1, 0) if he had one there. Current body: (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0). Tail at (2, 0).\nT17: Head (5, 0). Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6, 0) and eats an apple.\n*   New Head: (6, 0).\n*   New Body: (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0). **Tail is STILL at (2, 0).** Length is 5.\n\nOkay, the board state shown is correct: `0 . T T T T H . . A` (Where H is his head at (6, 0)). NOPE, the board shows a 0 at (6, 0) and TTTT at (5, 0) to (2, 0). The board is correctly depicting the head at (6, 0) and body at (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0). Perfect.\n\n**1. Lethality Check - Where can WE go from (4, 2)?**\n\nWe are at (4, 2). Our goal is to cut him off and apply immense pressure.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 3):** **SAFE.** This is a great move. It keeps us centralized and preps us to move wide or up.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 1):** **SAFE.** This takes us closer to the enemy on the x-axis, potentially preparing for a vertical cutoff.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 2):** *DANGER!* Crashes into our own body segment [(3, 2)]. NO!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 2):** **SAFE.** This is the *killer blow* move, chat! This directly blocks X=5/Y=1 and X=6/Y=1 if he tries to move up!\n\n**2. Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (6, 0))**\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 0). He is trapped! If he moves off the bottom row, he has two primary options for survival:\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 1):** **SAFE.** The most logical escape route. He needs room to breathe.\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 0):** *DANGER!* Crashes into his own body segment. NOPE!\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 0):** **SAFE.** Stays on the wall, moves toward the empty space, but still heavily contained.\n\nSnake #0 *must* move UP to (6, 1) to start his escape, or **RIGHT to (7, 0)** to conserve space and hope we move away.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision - The Execution!**\n\nWe have the score advantage (7 vs 4) and the length advantage (8 vs 5). This is the time to be relentlessly aggressive.\n\n**Scenario A: If we move RIGHT to (5, 2)** (Maximum pressure!)\n\n*   If Snake #0 moves **UP to (6, 1)**: NO collision. But now our head at (5, 2) is positioned perfectly. Next turn, we can pivot to (6, 2) and trap him directly against the body wall (X=5, Y=0). He will be severely restricted by our body along X=3 and X=4, and now we are closing in on X=5 and X=6. This is perfect.\n*   If Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (7, 0)**: NO collision. He gains more of the corner, but is still on the Y=0 wall. We are now at (5, 2) and can move DOWN to (5, 1) next turn, absolutely sealing the X=5 column. This is also excellent.\n\n**Scenario B: If we move UP to (4, 3)** (Safe positioning)\n\n*   This is a strong defensive move, maximizing our board control and keeping options open, but it allows the enemy to escape more easily. If he moves UP to (6, 1), he gets a good 2-cell buffer from our (4, 2) position. We lose control of the immediate escape diagonal.\n\n**Scenario C: If we move DOWN to (4, 1)** (Tempting the collision)\n\n*   This is risky. If he moves UP to (6, 1), we are not directly blocking him. If he moves RIGHT to (7, 0), we are too far down to block his UP move next turn. We need to control Y=2 and Y=1, not just Y=1.\n\n**Conclusion:** We must capitalize on his confined position. Moving **RIGHT to (5, 2)** is the highest-leverage move. It places us to intercept any vertical breakout attempt (UP to 6, 1) or to seal the x-axis (moves to 7, 0 or 8, 0). We are literally extending our boundary fence to tighten the chokehold.\n\nCHAT! Get ready for the clip. We are going right in to cut off his escape route! It\u2019s hammer time! \ud83d\udd28\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Correction & Strategy):** We are moving RIGHT to (5, 2) to establish the critical vertical block. This anticipates Snake #0 moving UP to (6, 1). If he does, our next move will be to pivot to (6, 2) or (5, 3) to continue pressuring him back down and into a hopeless corner. If he moves RIGHT, we will move DOWN to (5, 1) to seal X=5 entirely. The kill is imminent.\n***\n\nRIGHT",

I\u2019m already trailing, so I\u2019m going to trust the plan to push the pressure from below, keeping plenty of space in front while forcing them into my trap.\n\nPlan note: Keep riding the bottom row to eat (9,0), then cut up along the right wall to corral Snake #1 between my tail and the boundary\u2014if he tries to challenge, I\u2019ll be in a perfect spot to force a head-on once I\u2019m ahead on size.\n\nRIGHT",

We are currently right in his face, extending our wall and making his life absolutely miserable! 7 to 4 on the score, and we have the length advantage. This is the turn we secure the high ground! \u26f0\ufe0f\n\nLet's look at the current state!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head is at **(5, 2)**. Body wraps around [(4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]. We dominate the left side!\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):** Head is at **(7, 0)**. Body is [(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0)]. He escaped the immediate trap by moving RIGHT, but he's still pressed against the Y=0 wall, and now we control X=5!\n\n```\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . A . . . . . . A .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . T A . . . .\n 5 . . . . T . A . A .\n 4 . . . T T A . . . .\n 3 A . . T . A . . . .\n 2 . . . T T 1 . . A A <-- WE ARE AT (5, 2)\n 1 A . . . . . . . . A\n 0 A . . T T T T 0 . A <-- HE IS AT (7, 0)\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n*Wait, let's update the board with the actual moves from the last turn.*\n\n*   Your last move: RIGHT from (4, 2) to (5, 2).\n*   Opponent's implied move: RIGHT from (6, 0) to (7, 0). (He clearly didn't move UP because the board state shows him at (7, 0)). He did not eat an apple, so his tail (3, 0) vacated.\n\n**Let's re-verify the body of Snake #0 (Head: 7, 0; Body: 6, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0)**\nThe board shows `T T T T 0` starting at (3, 0) to (6, 0) and the head at (7, 0). Let's assume the board graphic is precise.\n\nIf his list is Head (7, 0), Body [(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0)]\u2014that's a length of 5. Did he grow last turn? No, he didn't eat an apple listed at (9, 0), (8, 2), or (9, 2). The one at (6, 0) was eaten on T17. If he moved from (6, 0) to (7, 0) on T18, his tail at (2, 0) would have vacated, making his body segments (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0) \u2014 meaning his tail is now at (3, 0). Length 5. Okay, let's trust the length 5 and the positions: (7, 0) head, (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0) tail.\n\nThe board state reflects this: `A . . T T T T 0 . A` (3,0 to 7,0). Perfect.\n\n### 1. Lethality Check - Where can WE go from (5, 2)?\n\nWe are at (5, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 3):** **SAFE.** Excellent positioning. Next to an apple at (5, 4) later, and extends our blocking wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 1):** **SAFE.** This is the coup de grace! It directly threatens to seal off the X=5 column and block the enemy's vertical travel.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 2):** *DANGER!* Crashes into our own body segment [(4, 2)]. NO!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):** **SAFE.** Puts us directly over the enemy's possible escape point (6, 1). HIGH PRESSURE move!\n\n### 2. Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (7, 0))\n\nSnake #0 is at (7, 0). He is desperate to get off the bottom wall.\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 1):** **SAFE.** The only logical escape route upwards. If he doesn't take this, he's basically committing suicide.\n2.  **LEFT to (6, 0):** *DANGER!* Crashes into his own body segment. NOPE!\n3.  **RIGHT to (8, 0):** **SAFE.** Moves toward the corner. He might grab the apple at (9, 0) or (0, 1) later one. However, this is a slow death. He needs to move UP.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves **UP to (7, 1)**.\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision - Trap the Opponent!\n\nWe have two incredibly powerful aggressive moves: **DOWN to (5, 1)** or **RIGHT to (6, 2)**.\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT to (6, 2)**\n\nIf we move to (6, 2):\n*   If Snake #0 moves **UP to (7, 1)**: NO COLLISION. We are now directly above his path. Next turn we can drop to (6, 1) or move RIGHT to (7, 2), effectively pinning him in the (7, 1) area. This secures the vertical cutoff at X=6 and starts sealing X=7. **This is highly aggressive and promises future kill opportunities.**\n*   If Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (8, 0)**: NO COLLISION. We are now at (6, 2) and can drop to (6, 1) or (5, 3). He is still trapped, and we have more space.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (5, 1)**\n\nIf we move to (5, 1):\n*   If Snake #0 moves **UP to (7, 1)**: NO COLLISION. We are now sealing off the X=5 column, but he still has plenty of maneuvering room to the right (X=6, X=7, X=8, X=9). We aren't directly threatening his path.\n*   If Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (8, 0)**: NO COLLISION. He is still trapped, but we are too low to put immediate pressure.\n\n**Conclusion:** We need to control the space just above the opponent's head. Since he is likely moving UP to (7, 1), moving **RIGHT to (6, 2)** is the superior maximizing move. It places us to intercept him horizontally (if he moves right) or vertically (if he moves up). It is also a very short hop to the apple at (8, 2) if the opportunity arises.\n\nWe are going for the direct box-in! **(6, 2)** is the position of power. Let's make him sweat, chat! We're putting the nail in the coffin! \ud83d\udd28\ud83d\udc51\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Correction & Strategy):** Move RIGHT to (6, 2). This intercepts Snake #0's likely UP move to (7, 1). If he moves to (7, 1), the next move will be either RIGHT to (7, 2) to continue blocking his path up, or DOWN to (6, 1) to force a vertical collision if he stays at (7, 1). We will not let him out of this corner!\n***\n\nRIGHT",

Lethality Check - Where can WE go from (6, 2)?\n\nWe are at (6, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 3):** **SAFE.** Good defensive move, keeps high ground.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 1):** **SAFE.** This is HIGH PRESSURE! Threatens to crash onto the enemy if he dares move up to (8, 1) next turn. It also seals off X=6.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 2):** *DANGER!* Crashes into our own body segment [(5, 2)]. NO!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 2):** **SAFE.** Puts us directly on the X=7 line, ready to corner him. Also adjacent to the apple at (8, 2)!\n\n### 2. Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (8, 0))\n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 1):** **SAFE.** This is the only move that makes sense if he wants to survive more than two turns. He needs to escape the Y=0 wall.\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 0):** *DANGER!* Crashes into his own body segment. NOPE!\n3.  **RIGHT to (9, 0):** **SAFE.** EATS the apple at (9, 0)! This buys him length and gets him into the far corner. Is gaining length worth being totally boxed in? Maybe. If he does this, he's basically committing to a wall crawl.\n\nPrediction: He will go for the **apple at (9, 0)** because snakes love apples, and it's his only chance to grow out of this deficit.\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision - The Box-In\n\nIf he goes for (9, 0) (RIGHT), we need to maintain pressure and secure the path above him. We have him trapped 4 blocks away (X=4 to X=8), and we control the board above Y=2.\n\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (7, 2)**:\n    *   If he moves RIGHT to (9, 0) (eats apple): No collision. We maintain the high ground and are poised to move to (8, 2) (apple) or drop to (7, 1) to seal him off at X=7. This perfectly responds to his move.\n    *   If he moves UP to (8, 1): No collision. We are now directly 1 square away from him horizontally, controlling vertical movement. We can move UP to (7, 3) or aggressive DOWN to (7, 1) next turn to intercept.\n\n*   If we move **DOWN to (6, 1)**:\n    *   If he moves RIGHT to (9, 0): No collision. We are too far away from the action, although we do seal off X=6.\n    *   If he moves UP to (8, 1): No collision. He still has the path to (9, 1). This is too passive for the kill.\n\nThe move **RIGHT to (7, 2)** appears to be the most lethal and opportunistic move. It directly pressures the available \"escape\" square (9, 1) and positions us perfectly to grab the apple at (8, 2) on the next turn, cementing our length advantage and wall control. This move is all about maximizing board control and capitalizing on the opponent's poor position.\n\nWe are pushing the wall down, Chat! We're not giving him an inch! The apple at (8, 2) is a bonus, but the primary goal is total suffocation.\n\n***\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Correction & Strategy):** Move RIGHT to (7, 2). This secures the vertical line at X=7 and positions us to take the apple at (8, 2) next turn, further extending our body and tightening the noose around Snake #0 as he struggles on the Y=0/Y=1 levels. We are creating a permanent barrier.\n***\n\nRIGHT",

We are currently dominating, and last turn's aggressive move to **(7, 2)** was pure tactical genius! Look at the board, look at the position!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 21)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(7, 2)**\n*   Body: [(6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]\n*   Length: 8. We didn't hit an apple, but we locked down a crucial column.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: **(9, 0)**\n*   Body: [(8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)]\n*   Length: 6. HE ATE THE APPLE AT (9, 0)! He grew and is now totally locked into the corner! This is exactly what we wanted, chat! The trap is set!\n\nLet's look at the board state again:\n\n```\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . A . . . . . . A .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . A . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . A . A .\n 4 . . . T T A . . . A\n 3 A . . T . A . . . .\n 2 . . .

Lethality Check - Where can WE go from (7, 2)?\n\nWe are at (7, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 3):** **SAFE.** High ground, good positional move.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 1):** **SAFE.** EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE! This is the move that seals the coffin. It blocks X=7 and Y=1, forcing him to scrape along the wall.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 2):** *DANGER!* Crashes into our own body segment. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):** **SAFE.** EATS the apple at (8, 2)! Increases our body length to 9 and puts us right next to him. This is content *and* aggression!\n\nAll three safe moves are strong, but one is clearly dominant.\n\n### 2. Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (9, 0))\n\nSnake #0 is at (9, 0). He is trapped! His only safe moves are:\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 1):** **SAFE.** This is his only real escape route. He *must* go up.\n2.  **LEFT to (8, 0):** *DANGER!* Crashes into his own body segment. NOPE! (His body starts at (8, 0)).\n3.  **DOWN/RIGHT:** Off the board. DEAD.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 **MUST** move **UP to (9, 1)** to survive this turn. If he is smart, he will go UP.\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision - The Squeeze Play\n\nIf he moves UP to (9, 1), we have a critical counter-move.\n\n*   **Option A: Move UP to (7, 3).** Safe, but keeps us somewhat distant. We want to be closer.\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN to (7, 1).** This is tempting. If we move to (7, 1), he moves to (9, 1). No immediate collision, but we prevent him from trying to use the X=7 column. However, it pulls us away from the high-value apple.\n*   **Option C: Move RIGHT to (8, 2) and EAT THE APPLE.** (The 'Money' Move).\n    *   If we go RIGHT to (8, 2) and he goes UP to (9, 1): No collision. Score goes to 8-5 (or 8-6 if he ate the apple at (9, 1), which he didn't, the apple is at (9, 2)). We are now adjacent to him at a dominating height, and we are longer (L9 vs L6)! We have secured the corner of the map above him.\n\nThis move (RIGHT to (8, 2)) is the *best* move. It gains us a point, significantly increases our length advantage (providing better boxing material), and positions us perfectly to dictate the flow of the game on the right side of the board. Next turn, we can easily drop down to (8, 1) or (7, 3) depending on his movement at (9, 1). This is maximum power, minimal risk.\n\nWe are establishing complete air superiority over this corner, chat! He is grounded, and we are flying high! \ud83d\ude80\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n\nMove RIGHT to (8, 2) to secure the apple and the length advantage. If Snake #0 moves UP to (9, 1), our next move will be to move DOWN to (8, 1) or LEFT to (7, 2) (if tail frees up) to maintain proximity and prepare for the final enclosure or forcing a future head-on engagement where our higher score will prevail. If we can get him to (9, 1) and stay there, we are winning the positioning war.\n\nRIGHT",

We are dominating this corner of the map, and last turn's strategic apple grab at **(8, 2)** was pure, unadulterated fire! \ud83d\udd25 Look at our massive L9 body wrapped around him!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 22)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(8, 2)** (We just ate the apple! +1 length, +1 score!)\n*   Body: [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]\n*   Length: 9. We are the boa constrictor, and he is the small, terrified mouse!\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: **(9, 1)** (He moved exactly as predicted: UP from (9, 0)!)\n*   Body: [(9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)]\n*   Length: 6.

Lethality Check - Where can WE go from (8, 2)?\n\nWe are the aggressor. We need to maintain pressure.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 3):** **SAFE.** Retreats slightly, but retains positional dominance. Good safe move.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 1):** **SAFE.** THIS IS THE MONEY MOVE, CHAT! It puts us right next to him at (8, 1) and blocks his only potential escape route into the X=8 column. It also forces him to choose between wall-scraping and dying!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 2):** *DANGER!* Crashes into our own body segment. NOPE! (Our body starts at (7, 2)).\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 2):** **SAFE.** EATS the apple at (9, 2)! Another point, another length segment! But this is less direct pressure on him than going DOWN.\n\nAll three safe moves are brilliant, but we are looking for the kill shot, the maximum pressure.\n\n### 2. Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (9, 1))\n\nSnake #0 is at (9, 1). His options are brutal:\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 2):** **SAFE-BUT-RISKY** (due to us). If he goes here, he grabs the apple at (9, 2). This is his only way to gain length and try to escape the walls.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 0):** *DANGER!* Crashes into his own body segment. NOPE! (His body starts at (9, 0)).\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 1):** **SAFE-BUT-RISKY** (due to us). This is his attempt to break out of the corner and get off the Y=1 line.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Off the board. DEAD.\n\nPrediction: He is *most likely* going **UP to (9, 2)** to grab the apple and gain crucial length. If he goes LEFT to (8, 1), he's walking right into our clutches.\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision - The Corner Trap\n\nWe have two incredibly strong options that both involve apples: (8, 1) and (9, 2). Wait, there is **no apple at (8, 1)**. The apple is at (9, 2). My bad, chat! Focus!\n\nLet's re-evaluate the two best aggressive moves:\n\n*   **Option A: Move RIGHT to (9, 2) and EAT THE APPLE.**\n    *   If we go here, we prevent him from getting the apple and grow to L10, scoring 9 apples.\n    *   What does he do then? If we take (9, 2), he is severely limited. He might try to go LEFT to (8, 1).\n    *   If we both aim for (9, 2): HOMICIDE! Head-on collision! Both heads die in the same cell. **SCORE 8-6, we win the tiebreaker!** This is a clean win!\n\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN to (8, 1).**\n    *   This is the positional trap. It blocks the X=8 column escape path for his head.\n    *   If we go to (8, 1), and he goes UP to (9, 2) (and eats the apple): Score 8-7. No immediate threat, but he is still squeezed. We can then press the box next turn.\n\n**Conclusion: We are ahead 8-6. FORCING A HEAD-ON COLLISION IS AN IMMEDIATE WIN.**\n\nThe enemy knows his only path to grow is the apple at (9, 2). If he chooses survival (moving LEFT to (8, 1)), we still secure the apple at (9, 2) next turn, or we push down and squeeze at (8, 1).\n\n**The most aggressive, highest probability move for an immediate win is RIGHT to (9, 2).** If he also goes RIGHT, we win the game right now on score! If he moves LEFT to (8, 1) to survive, we still get the apple, grow to L10, and perfectly position ourselves to wall him in with our massive body (L10 vs L6/7). We win either way! This is the ultimate alpha play, chat!\n\n**If we move RIGHT, and he moves LEFT:**\n* We are at (9, 2) (L10, A9).\n* He is at (8, 1) (L6, A6).\n* Next turn, we can drop to (9, 1) or move to (8, 2) to continue trapping. He is still trapped. This is great.\n\n**If we move RIGHT, and he moves UP:**\n* Both heads move to (9, 2).\n* Both die. Score 8-6. We win!\n\n**This is the move! We go for the apple and the lethal collision.**\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Self-Note if we survive the collision attempt):\n\nIf the enemy avoids the collision and moves to (8, 1), we will follow up by dropping to (9, 1) to continue the corner choke, maintaining the overwhelming length advantage and dictating the space. We must not let him move freely into the lower left quadrant.\n\nRIGHT",
