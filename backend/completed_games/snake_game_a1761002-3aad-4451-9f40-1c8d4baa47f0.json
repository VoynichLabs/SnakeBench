DOWN to (3,8)**\n- New head position: (3,8).\n- Check for apples: No apple at (3,8).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - No other snake is at (3,8) (enemy is at (3,4)).\n  - No self-collision (no body yet).\n- Future options:\n  - From (3,8), you could move LEFT to (2,8), RIGHT to (4,8), or UP to (3,9) (back to original position).\n  - This keeps flexibility but doesn\u2019t immediately approach any apples.\n\n#### **2. LEFT to (2,9)**\n- New head position: (2,9).\n- Check for apples: No apple at (2,9).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - No other snake is at (2,9).\n  - No self-collision.\n- Future options:\n  - From (2,9), you could move DOWN to (2,8), UP is invalid (off the board), RIGHT to (3,9) (back to original), or LEFT to (1,9).\n  - This is a good position to explore the top row or move downward.\n\n#### **3. RIGHT to (4,9)**\n- New head position: (4,9).\n- Check for apples: No apple at (4,9).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - No other snake is at (4,9).\n  - No self-collision.\n- Future options:\n  - From (4,9), you could move DOWN to (4,8), LEFT to (3,9) (back to original), or RIGHT to (5,9).\n  - This is the farthest right on the top row, which might be useful for avoiding the enemy or reaching apples on the right side.\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Proximity and Strategy**\n- Closest apples to your head (3,9):\n  - (4,1): Distance = sqrt((4-3)^2 + (1-9)^2) = sqrt(1 + 64) = ~8.06 (far).\n  - (7,0): Distance = sqrt((7-3)^2 + (0-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = ~9.43 (far).\n  - (2,5): Distance = sqrt((2-3)^2 + (5-9)^2) = sqrt(1 + 16) = ~4.12 (closer).\n  - (5,6): Distance = sqrt((5-3)^2 + (6-9)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9) = ~3.61 (closest).\n  - (5,4): Distance = sqrt((5-3)^2 + (4-9)^2) = sqrt(4 + 25) = ~5.48.\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,6), which is 3.61 units away. To reach it, you\u2019d need to move downward and rightward.\n\n#### **Path to (5,6):**\n- From (3,9), moving RIGHT to (4,9) is a step toward the x-coordinate of the apple (5).\n- From (4,9), you could move DOWN to (4,8), then (4,7), etc., until you reach (5,6).\n\n#### **Alternative Paths:**\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9) is not directly helpful for reaching (5,6).\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8) is also not directly helpful for reaching (5,6).\n\nThus, **RIGHT to (4,9)** is the best first move to start heading toward the closest apple at (5,6).\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Movement Considerations**\n- Enemy snake (ID 0) is at (3,4).\n- The enemy\u2019s possible moves are:\n  - UP: (3,5).\n  - DOWN: (3,3).\n  - LEFT: (2,4).\n  - RIGHT: (4,4).\n- None of these overlap with your current or potential next positions (you\u2019re at (3,9), moving to (4,9)).\n- No immediate threat of collision.\n\n---\n\n### **Future Plan (Next Few Turns)**\n1. **Turn 0**: Move RIGHT to (4,9) to start heading toward (5,6).\n2. **Turn 1**: From (4,9), move DOWN to (4,8) to approach the apple\u2019s y-coordinate.\n3. **Turn 2**: From (4,8), move DOWN to (4,7).\n4. **Turn 3**: From (4,7), move RIGHT to (5,7) (just before the apple at (5,6)).\n5. **Turn 4**: From (5,7), move DOWN to (5,6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis path is efficient and avoids unnecessary detours.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe best move is **RIGHT**, as it starts the snake on a direct path to the closest apple at (5,6) while keeping future options open.\n\n**RIGHT**",

This seems like the best immediate option.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the enemy's potential moves. The enemy is at (3,9) and could move down toward me. If I move RIGHT to (4,4), and enemy moves DOWN to (3,8), we're not on a collision course yet.\n\nLooking at the board, moving RIGHT gives me good positioning for multiple apples (both at x=5) while keeping options open. The space to the right is more open than to the left.\n\nStrategy note for future turns: Focus on the cluster of apples around x=5 (at y=4 and y=6) as they're close together.

DOWN (5,3):\n   - Not off board\n   - Not into my own body\n   - Not into enemy body\n   - Safe\n\n3. LEFT (4,4):\n   - This would move into my own body (backwards move)\n   - Unsafe (would kill me)\n\n4. RIGHT (6,4):\n   - Not off board\n   - Not into my own body\n   - Not into enemy body\n   - Safe\n\nNow let's evaluate the safe moves:\n\n- UP (5,5): Moves toward apple at (5,6)\n- DOWN (5,3): Moves toward apple at (4,1)\n- RIGHT (6,4): Moves away from most apples but opens up space\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,6), which is directly above. Moving UP would position me to collect this apple next turn. The apple at (5,6) is only 1 cell away vertically.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,9) and could potentially move down toward me, but they're currently 4 cells away vertically. If I move UP to (5,5), and the enemy moves DOWN, we'd still be 3 cells apart next turn.\n\nLooking at the board, moving UP gives me immediate progress toward the closest apple and keeps me in a good position for future moves. The space above is open and I can continue moving toward (5,6) next turn.\n\nStrategy note for future turns: After moving UP, focus on collecting the apple at (5,6) next turn. Be cautious of enemy movement from above, but maintain progress toward apples.\n\nUP",
