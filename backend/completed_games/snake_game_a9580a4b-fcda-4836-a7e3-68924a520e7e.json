Wait, this is confusing - the enemy snake head is shown at the same position as the apple? Let me check the board representation again.\n\nLooking at the board, position (0, 9) shows \"1\" which indicates enemy snake #1's head is there. But the apple list still shows an apple at (0, 9). This seems like the enemy snake is already at the apple position.\n\nActually, let me re-read this carefully. The enemy snake positions show Snake #1 at (0, 9) with body at [(1, 9), (2, 9)]. Looking at the board, I see:\n- Row 9: \"1 T T . . . . . . .\" \n- This means enemy snake head \"1\" is at (0, 9), and body segments \"T\" are at (1, 9) and (2, 9)\n\nIf the enemy snake is already at (0, 9), then I cannot move there as it would mean running into another snake. That would be death.\n\nSo my only safe option is:\n- RIGHT: Move to (1, 8) which appears empty\n\nThis is disappointing as I was so close to the apple, but the enemy snake beat me to it (or is about to take it).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (1, 8), I should pivot to target other apples.

However, in many snake games all snakes move simultaneously; it is possible that enemy snake 0 will leave (0,8) on its turn (for example, if it moves in some other direction).

I'm one move away from the apple at (0, 9)!\n\nLooking at my options from (0, 8):\n- LEFT: Would hit the wall at x=-1 - DEATH\n- RIGHT: Would move to (1, 8) which is empty\n- DOWN: Would move to (0, 7) where my body segment is - DEATH\n- UP: Would move to (0, 9) where the apple is - GROWTH!\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at position (0, 9) with body at [(1, 9), (2, 9)]. Wait, this is confusing - the enemy snake head is shown at the same position as the apple? Let me check the board representation again.\n\nLooking at the board, position (0, 9) shows \"1\" which indicates enemy snake #1's head is there. But the apple list still shows an apple at (0, 9). This seems like the enemy snake is already at the apple position.\n\nActually, let me re-read this carefully. The enemy snake positions show Snake #1 at (0, 9) with body at [(1, 9), (2, 9)]. Looking at the board, I see:\n- Row 9: \"1 T T . . . . . . .\" \n- This means enemy snake head \"1\" is at (0, 9), and body segments \"T\" are at (1, 9) and (2, 9)\n\nIf the enemy snake is already at (0, 9), then I cannot move there as it would mean running into another snake. That would be death.\n\nSo my only safe option is:\n- RIGHT: Move to (1, 8) which appears empty\n\nThis is disappointing as I was so close to the apple, but the enemy snake beat me to it (or is about to take it).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (1, 8), I should pivot to target other apples. The closest ones would be (5, 2) and (7, 2) in the lower portion of the board, or (6, 7) which is relatively close, or (0, 3) on the left side.\n\nRIGHT"

(Remember we grew when our previous LEFT move collected the apple at (0,9).) Looking at the neighbors of our head at (0,9):\n\n\u2022 UP: (0,10) is off the board.\n\u2022 LEFT: (\u20131,9) is off the board.\n\u2022 RIGHT: (1,9) is already part of our body (and is not our tail\u2014our tail is (2,9)\u2014so even though that tail would be removed if we didn\u2019t eat, (1,9) certainly isn\u2019t coming free).\n\u2022 DOWN: (0,8) is currently occupied by the enemy snake\u2019s head (snake 0). \n\nUnder normal circumstances, running into another snake (or into our own body) is fatal. However, in many snake games all snakes move simultaneously; it is possible that enemy snake 0 will leave (0,8) on its turn (for example, if it moves in some other direction). Although there is risk in moving DOWN into a square that right now has an enemy head, the other three moves are immediately fatal because they go off the board or into our own body.\n\nSo, in an unfortunate situation where no move is instantly completely \u201csafe\u201d by static board appearance, my best (and only) chance is to gamble and move DOWN. I\u2019ll hope that enemy snake 0 isn\u2019t also moving into (0,8) or that its timing makes it vacate that square. (On future turns I\u2019ll target one of the remaining apples to build my score further, but now the choice is forced.)\n\nThus, the next move is: DOWN."
