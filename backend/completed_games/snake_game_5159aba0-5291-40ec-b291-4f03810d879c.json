This will give me a better chance of scoring points and growing my snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll try to move to the right and see if I can reach the apple at (4, 1).

There's also an enemy snake at position (6, 1), but it doesn't seem to be a threat at the moment.\n\nOur goal is to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding the enemy snake and the walls. Since the closest apple is to the left, our best move would be to move in that direction.\n\nHowever, we should also keep an eye on the enemy snake and be prepared to change our direction if necessary. For now, let's focus on collecting the apple at (4, 1).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on the enemy snake and be prepared to change direction if it moves towards us.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
