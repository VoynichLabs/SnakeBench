Apple at (8, 1): Distance from (8, 3) = 2 moves down. This is the closest apple!\n2. Apple at (6, 4): Distance from (8, 3) = 2 left + 1 up = 3 moves\n3. Apple at (3, 5): Distance from (8, 3) = 5 left + 2 up = 7 moves\n4. Apple at (1, 4): Distance from (8, 3) = 7 left + 1 up = 8 moves\n5. Apple at (0, 5): Distance from (8, 3) = 8 left + 2 up = 10 moves\n\nThe enemy snake at (0, 9) is closest to the apples on the left side (0, 5) and (1, 4) and (3, 5).\n\nMy best strategy is to grab the apple at (8, 1) which is only 2 moves away (going down twice), then potentially go for (6, 4).\n\nSo I should move DOWN to get closer to the apple at (8, 1).\n\nLet me verify:\n- Current position: (8, 3)\n- Moving DOWN: (8, 2) - safe\n- Then DOWN again: (8, 1) - apple! I'll grow and gain a point.\n\nAfter that, I could target (6, 4) which would be at distance 2 left + 3 up from (8, 1).\n\nStrategy note for future:\n1. Go down to (8, 1) to get the first apple (2 moves)\n2. Then head towards (6, 4)\n3. Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements\n\nMy move: DOWN\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\nMy head is at (8, 3) with no body segments. The enemy snake is at (0, 9), far away in the opposite corner.\n\nLet me evaluate my options:\n- UP (8, 4): Safe, empty space\n- DOWN (8, 2): Safe, moves toward apple at (8, 1)\n- LEFT (7, 3): Safe, empty space\n- RIGHT (9, 3): Safe, but moves toward edge\n\nAll moves are safe since I have no body and the enemy is distant.\n\nApple analysis:\n- Apple at (8, 1): Only 2 moves down - closest apple!\n- Apple at (6, 4): 3 moves away (2 left, 1 up)\n- Other apples are on the left side closer to the enemy\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\n1. Move DOWN twice to collect the apple at (8, 1) - this is my quickest score\n2. After collecting (8, 1), head toward (6, 4) which will be 3 moves away\n3. The enemy at (0, 9) will likely go for the apples at (0, 5) or (3, 5), so I should focus on the right side apples first\n\nThe apple at (8, 1) is essentially mine for the taking with no competition. Going down now puts me one step closer.\n\nDOWN",
