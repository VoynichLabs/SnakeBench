Avoiding downward or lateral moves preserves flexibility and avoids potential future traps.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAfter securing the apple at (2,4), prioritize moving toward cluster of apples at higher x/y coordinates (e.g., (5,8), (7,9), (8,8)). Keep an eye on enemy snake at (3,6); avoid head-on collisions by anticipating its movement. Maintain a path to open board edges to prevent entrapment.\n\nUP",

However, I should focus on the apples that are more accessible to me.\n\nThe nearest apple to me is at (2, 4), but the enemy is very close to it. The next closest apple is at (5, 8), which is 2 columns right and 2 rows up from my current position. Moving RIGHT gets me closer to multiple apples in the right side of the board.\n\n**Strategy Note**: I should move towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board (at positions (5, 8), (7, 9), and (8, 8)). The apple at (2, 4) is too close to the enemy snake and may be contested. Moving right positions me to potentially reach (5, 8) in a few moves while keeping options open for the apples at (7, 9) and (8, 8).\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (8, 4) is directly below me, and the apple at (0, 7) is on the left side. Moving down will get me closer to the apple at (8, 4), and moving right will also get me closer to the apple at (8, 4). Moving down gives me better positioning and opens up more options on the right side. I should move DOWN to get closer to the apple at (8, 4).\n\nDOWN",
