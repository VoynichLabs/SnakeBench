Moving DOWN would get me to an apple at (1, 4), which is optimal. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would be safe but wouldn't get me closer to any apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (1, 4) and collecting the apple, I'll grow to length 2. From there, I should consider moving RIGHT toward the apple at (2, 3), which would be the next closest apple.\n\nDOWN"
