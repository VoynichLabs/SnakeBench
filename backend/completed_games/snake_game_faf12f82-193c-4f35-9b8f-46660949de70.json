Enemy Snake:**\n- Snake #0 is currently at `(8, 4)`, with an empty body (single segment).

Moving upward and left toward it should be my primary goal since it aligns with my last move rationale.\n- **Apple at (3, 9):** This apple is also in the upper-left corner, within reasonable reach once I get closer to `(2, 7)`.\n- **Apple at (8, 5):** This is closest to Snake #0, making it very risky and unlikely to reach in time. I will deprioritize it.\n- **Apple at (9, 3):** This apple is similarly near Snake #0, so it is also risky and not worth targeting immediately.\n- **Apple at (2, 2):** This is closer to me than the others in the lower-left quadrant. However, its positioning doesn't fit with my current path toward `(2, 7)`.\n\n#### 3. **Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head is at `(9, 5)` with a body at `(9, 4)`.\n- The enemy snake is in the middle-right of the board, nearer to `(8, 5)` and `(9, 3)`. It\u2019s highly likely that it will target one or both of those apples.\n- For now, Snake #0 does not pose an immediate threat to me given the distance between us and our differing goals.\n\n#### 4. **Immediate Threats:**\n- Doubling back on my body is an immediate concern since my snake is at two segments.\n- Walls are not currently an issue since I'm in the middle of the board.\n- Safe movement options include staying consistent with my planned trajectory left and up toward `(2, 7)`.\n\n---\n\n### Planned Strategy:\n- **Primary Goal:** In this turn, I will aim to continue moving toward the safest apple at `(2, 7)`. I\u2019ll progress in a controlled, safe manner toward the upper-left corner.\n- **Future Pathing:** Once `(2, 7)` is collected, I will consider `(3, 9)` as a follow-up target since it\u2019s in the same general area and away from Snake #0.\n- **Defensive Play:** Avoid competition with Snake #0 and monitor its next moves to ensure no sudden changes in trajectory toward the upper-left quadrant.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating Movement Options:\n- **UP (3, 5):** This positions me slightly closer to `(2, 7)` while maintaining a safe distance from walls and my body. It\u2019s a strong candidate since it keeps my trajectory consistent and prepares me for efficient upward movement around the `(2, 6)` area.\n- **DOWN (3, 3):** This moves me away from safe apple targets. Additionally, it\u2019s not strategic since it forces me downward into an area that can potentially get cramped (near `(2, 2)`).\n- **LEFT (2, 4):** This would progress me sideways and nearer to `(2, 7)` in the short term. However, given I\u2019m already aligned horizontally with `(2, 7)`, this move delays my upward trajectory and doesn\u2019t make meaningful progress toward my main apple target.\n- **RIGHT (4, 4):** This would result in doubling back onto my body and would kill me instantly.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Moving **UP** to `(3, 5)` is the best move as it positions me closer to `(2, 7)` and sets up efficient navigation toward the upper-left corner of the board.\n\n---\n\n### Decision:\n**Next Move: UP**"

Doubling back onto the body would result in instant death.\n\n#### 2. **Apple Analysis:**\n- **Apple at (2, 7):**\n  - This remains the safest and most strategically valuable apple. It's in an open area with no current threat from Snake #0.\n  - Moving upward aligns my position to eventually move closer to `(2, 7)`.\n- **Apple at (3, 9):**\n  - This is in the same quadrant as `(2, 7)` but requires further vertical movement. Once I collect `(2, 7)`, this will make a good follow-up target.\n- **Apple at (9, 3):**\n  - This remains risky because Snake #0 is in the vicinity and moving in this direction could get me trapped.\n- **Apple at (2, 2):**\n  - This apple is closer than some others, but would require doubling back downward instead of continuing my current trajectory. While reachable, it is not worth prioritizing given my existing strategy.\n- **Apple at (7, 1):**\n  - This is very far away and not worth considering at this time since I'm closer to more easily accessible apples.\n\n#### 3. **Enemy Snake #0:**\n- **Position:** Head at `(8, 5)`, body at `[(9, 5), (9, 4)]`.\n- Snake #0 is still far away, but its head is in the middle-left quadrant, likely positioning itself to target either `(8, 5)` or `(9, 3)`. Its proximity to the right side of the board eliminates immediate competition for apples in the upper-left quadrant `(2, 7)` and `(3, 9)`.\n\n#### 4. **Immediate Threats:**\n- **Doubling back onto myself:** Moving **RIGHT** back to `(3, 4)` would kill me instantly.\n- **The walls:** Not a current concern since I\u2019m safely in the center of the board.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** No immediate threat, but keeping an eye on its path is essential in case it shifts direction.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating Movement Options:\n#### **UP to (3, 6):**\n- Brings me closer to the apple at `(2, 7)` while maintaining safety.\n- Prepares me for smooth navigation toward the upper-left apple, allowing easy movement options on future turns.\n- Aligns with my last move's intended trajectory up the board.\n\n#### **DOWN to (3, 4):**\n- Retraces my path and moves toward my own body, making this move pointless and regressive. Additionally, it provides no progress toward any apple and places me in unnecessary danger if I decide to turn back.\n\n#### **LEFT to (2, 5):**\n- Moves me closer to `(2, 7)` horizontally but sacrifices the vertical positioning required for direct access to the apple. It disrupts my trajectory and introduces inefficiency.\n\n#### **RIGHT to (4, 5):**\n- Moves me away from all apple targets and results in killing myself by doubling back onto my body.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for This Turn:\n- Moving **UP** is the best course of action. It keeps me safe, aligns with my previous path, and positions me optimally for the apple at `(2, 7)`.\n- Monitor Snake #0\u2019s future positioning. If it makes an unexpected push toward the left side, I may need to re-evaluate my course to avoid conflict.\n\n---\n\n### Next Turn Strategy:\n1. If I move **UP** to `(3, 6)` and Snake #0 stays on its current path, I will continue moving toward `(2, 7)` by going **LEFT** to `(2, 6)`.\n2. After capturing `(2, 7)`, I'll prioritize the apple at `(3, 9)` to strengthen my current standing and grow my snake.\n\n---\n\n### Decision:\n**Next Move: UP**"

My body is below my head, so the only move that kills me here is going backward to **DOWN**.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Apple Assessment:**\n- **Apple at (2, 7):**\n  - This apple remains the closest and safest option. It is currently two moves away (`LEFT` to `(2, 6)` and then `UP` to `(2, 7)`).\n- **Apple at (3, 9):**\n  - This is the apple I can prioritize after collecting `(2, 7)`. It\u2019s positioned further vertically up and requires minimal adjustments.\n- **Apple at (9, 3):**\n  - Still unsafe. It\u2019s on the opposite side of the board where Snake #0 is lurking near `(8, 4)` and `(8, 5)`.

Based on its last known position, it\u2019s likely to continue hovering in that area near `(9, 3)` and the vertical path between `(8, 3)` to `(8, 6)`. It poses no immediate threat to my movement in the left half of the board.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Movement Options and Evaluation:**\n\n1. **UP to (3, 7):**\n   - This move positions me directly adjacent to the apple at `(2, 7)`, preparing me to collect it on the following turn by moving left. \n   - It is safe, with no obstacles or threats in the vicinity.\n   - It keeps my trajectory efficient and aligned with my current goal of reaching `(2, 7)`.\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 5):**\n   - This would be disastrous, as it would involve me doubling back onto my own body and resulting in immediate death.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 6):**\n   - While this brings me horizontally closer to the apple at `(2, 7)`, it is less efficient than moving upward first. Collecting `(2, 7)` after moving left would require an additional upward move, making this a less optimal sequence.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 6):**\n   - This direction moves me away from the closest apple and disrupts my current upward trajectory. It makes no strategic sense and delays progress toward collecting any apple.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn:\n- If I move **UP** to `(3, 7)` this turn:\n  1. I will proceed **LEFT** to `(2, 7)` to collect the apple.\n  2. After collecting the apple, I will reassess the board.

It is still concentrated on the far-right side of the board and poses no immediate threat to my current trajectory.\n- The left quadrant of the board (where I\u2019m operating) remains safe, with no incoming head-to-head snake collisions or body-blocking hazards thus far.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Evaluation of Movement Options from `(2, 7)`:**\n\n1. **UP to `(2, 8):**\n   - **Safe and optimal.** This move positions me closer to the apple at `(3, 9)`. From here, I can easily switch to the **RIGHT** or continue upward, depending on Snake #0\u2019s future behavior.\n\n2. **DOWN to `(2, 6):**\n   - Unsafe and unnecessary. Moving downward moves me farther away from my desired goal and risks encircling myself with my own body, limiting future movement options.\n\n3. **LEFT to `(1, 7):**\n   - Unhelpful trajectory. Moving left doesn\u2019t progress toward any apple and instead takes me farther from useful targets.\n\n4. **RIGHT to `(3, 7):**\n   - Safe. However, it doesn\u2019t effectively position me to reach the apple at `(3, 9)`. Moving to the **RIGHT** would be inefficient and might lead to unnecessary complications with movement planning.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Strategy:\n- My immediate goal this turn is to **move UP** to `(2, 8)` to position myself closer to the apple at `(3, 9)`. This sets up a clean and simple path toward that target.\n- After collecting the apple at `(3, 9)`, the next best target will most likely be `(7, 7)`, depending on the enemy snake\u2019s movement. I\u2019ll reassess the situation after growing and will continue to monitor Snake #0 to adjust my decisions accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Move Decision:\nTo safely and effectively progress toward the apple at `(3, 9)`, my next move is: **UP**."

Both are lower-priority targets.\n   - The apple at `(7, 3)` is closer to Snake #0; going after it could bring me close to the enemy snake\u2019s path, so it\u2019s not worth pursuing right now.\n\n2. **Board Control and Avoidance**:\n   - Maintaining control of the central or top-middle portion of the board ensures that I have good flexibility and maneuverability.\n   - Avoid the bottom area of the board, where Snake #0 is lingering and where the apple `(7, 3)` is located.\n\n---\n\n#### Best Next Move Decision:\n- I am currently at `(3, 8)` and have several options:\n  - **UP (to `(3, 9)`)**:\n    - This move would be moving backward onto my body segment, resulting in **death**. It\u2019s invalid.\n  - **DOWN (to `(3, 7)`)**:\n    - This moves me closer to `(2, 2)`, but it takes me away from the central board area and the key apples `(7, 7)` and `(6, 6)`. Not the best move at this point.\n  - **LEFT (to `(2, 8)`)**:\n    - This would be stepping into my snake\u2019s body, which also results in **death**. Invalid.\n  - **RIGHT (to `(4, 8)`)**:\n    - This is the best move! Moving right keeps me in the top-mid area of the board, positions me closer to the apple clusters `(7, 7)` and `(6, 6)`, and maintains a safe path forward that avoids walls, obstacles, and the enemy snake.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward:\n1. After moving to `(4, 8)`, I will progressively move toward `(6, 6)` and `(7, 7)` depending on the enemy\u2019s movements and my proximity to the apples.\n2. I will carefully avoid the bottom half of the board for now, as Snake #0 and the apple `(7, 3)` make it a potential danger zone.\n3. Lastly, staying near the center of the board will allow me to adapt dynamically to new apple respawns if they occur after I collect more apples.\n\n---\n\n### Decided Move: **RIGHT**  \nThis move progresses toward my next target apples `(7, 7)` and `(6, 6)`, keeps me safe, and positions me for board control."

Very far and inefficient to chase right now.\n   - `(7, 7)` and `(6, 6)`: Positioned near the top right. These apples are close to each other, making them the most efficient targets moving forward.\n   - `(7, 3)`: Positioned near the middle-right but lies in Snake #0's potential path, so it is not safe.\n   - `(0, 7)`: Positioned far to the left. It has low priority since my focus is on the apples near `(7, 7)` and `(6, 6)`.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake (#0)'s Position**:\n   - Snake #0's head is at `(8, 1)`. Its body is in the bottom-right section of the board. Snake #0 currently does not pose any immediate threat because it is focused near the lower quadrant.\n\n4. **Board Objectives**:\n   - Focus on the critical apples `(7, 7)` and `(6, 6)` near the top-right of the board.\n   - Continue to maintain control of the central area of the board for flexibility.\n   - Avoid heading into Snake #0's potential path near `(7, 3)` and the bottom-right quadrant.\n\n---\n\n#### **Evaluating Move Options**\n\nFrom `(4, 8)`, my possible moves are:\n\n1. **UP `(4, 9)`**:\n   - Valid move.\n   - Brings me to the very top row of the board but does not immediately progress toward my targets `(7, 7)` and `(6, 6)`.\n   - Could potentially box me in later if I cannot escape downward or to the sides. Not ideal.\n\n2. **DOWN `(4, 7)`**:\n   - Valid move.\n   - Moves me closer to `(7, 3)`, but chasing this apple increases the likelihood of running into Snake #0. Not safe.\n   - Also moves me farther away from the optimal targets `(7, 7)` and `(6, 6)`. Not a strong choice.\n\n3. **LEFT `(3, 8)`**:\n   - Invalid move. Leads to collision with my body. **Death.**\n\n4. **RIGHT `(5, 8)`**:\n   - Valid move.\n   - This move keeps me in the upper-middle portion of the board, in safe regions.\n   - Moves me closer to `(6, 6)` and `(7, 7)`. This aligns perfectly with my current strategy.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategic Plan**\n- Move **RIGHT** to `(5, 8)` this turn, continuing my trajectory toward apples `(7, 7)` and `(6, 6)` while remaining in optimal control of the central board.\n- Plan a path to navigate safely toward the cluster of `(7, 7)` and `(6, 6)` in the coming turns.

Grabbing this apple will extend my snake\u2019s body by 1 unit and grant me a point.\n   - **(7, 7)**: Still fairly nearby, but secondary in priority since (6, 6) is directly accessible.\n   - **(7, 3)**, **(2, 2)**, **(0, 7)**: Not relevant right now due to distance and the risk associated with Snake #0 in nearby zones.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake #0**:\n   - **Position**: Head at `(9, 3)`, body trailing lower-right in the board.\n   - Currently not a direct threat due to its distant location. However, its proximity to `(7, 3)` makes pursuing that apple risky in the near future.\n\n4. **Safety Evaluation**:\n   - Moving downward to `(6, 6)` is safe. There are no immediate threats or conflicts in this area.\n   - My snake\u2019s body is moving forward as usual and presents no obstacles for the planned move.\n\n---\n\n#### **Evaluating Move Options** (from `(6, 7)`):\n\n1. **UP `(6, 8)`**:\n   - Invalid. Moving backward into my own body results in immediate death. **No-go.**\n\n2. **DOWN `(6, 6)`**:\n   - **Best move**.\n   - Directly secures the apple at `(6, 6)`, increasing my score and growing my snake.\n   - Safest move, as both `(6, 6)` and the surrounding tiles are unoccupied.\n   - After consuming this apple, I can adjust my plan to either focus on `(7, 7)` or assess the relative dangers of Snake #0 before deciding on further moves.\n\n3. **LEFT `(5, 7)`**:\n   - Valid move.\n   - However, this would take me away from the apple at `(6, 6)` and delay progress toward scoring.\n   - Additionally, it introduces minor risk as it could restrict future flexibility by moving closer to my own body. **Not ideal.**\n\n4. **RIGHT `(7, 7)`**:\n   - Valid move.\n   - Moves closer to the apple `(7, 7)`, but sacrifices the opportunity to immediately capture the apple `(6, 6)`, which is more efficient.\n   - While this keeps tactical flexibility open, it lacks the immediate benefit of eating the readily available apple at `(6, 6)`. **Suboptimal at this juncture.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategic Plan**\n1. **Immediate Move**:\n   - Move **DOWN** to `(6, 6)` to secure the apple and gain a point.\n   - Once the apple is consumed, my new snake head will be at `(6, 6)` and I must analyze board conditions again to decide the best next target (likely `(7, 7)`).\n\n2. **Secondary Plan for the Next Turn**:\n   - If Snake #0 stays far away in the lower-right quadrant, consider heading toward `(7, 7)` since it remains an accessible second target.\n   - Avoid moving toward `(7, 3)` for now due to Snake #0\u2019s trailing body in the area.\n   - Monitor for any changes in enemy movement patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Decided Next Move: **DOWN**"

It is only one tile away, making it both accessible and low-risk.\n\n2. **Apple Locations**:  \n   - **(7, 7)**: Highest priority apple. Directly reachable in 1 move.  \n   - **(0, 7)**: Far away and less urgent as it is on the opposite side of the board. However, it is completely safe from enemy interference should I decide to pursue it later.  \n   - **(6, 3)**: Proximity to **Snake #0's** head `(7, 3)` makes it riskier at the moment.  \n   - **(2, 2)**: Very distant, no tactical incentive to consider it now.  \n   - **(0, 0)**: Similarly distant and hard to evaluate as a viable goal this turn.  \n\n3. **Snake #0 (Enemy)**:  \n   - **Head**: `(7, 3)`  \n   - **Body**: `[(8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1)]`  \n   - The enemy remains contained in the lower-right quadrant of the board. Its current trajectory and body structure do not impact my immediate path toward the apple `(7, 7)`.  \n   - However, **Snake #0** may shift its focus to `(6, 3)` since that apple becomes directly accessible to it. I must remain vigilant in case the snake decides to move toward the center of the board.\n\n4. **Safety Evaluation**:  \n   - Moving directly to **`(7, 7)`** is safe. There are no immediate threats from Snake #0 or my own body.  \n   - The apple at `(7, 7)` is also tactically advantageous, as it will keep my snake in a relatively central position with flexibility to pivot toward other apples or react to the enemy snake\u2019s movements.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Move Options (from `(7, 6)`)**:\n\n1. **UP `(7, 7)`**:  \n   - **Best move**. This grants me the apple at `(7, 7)`, extends my body by one segment, and earns a point.  \n   - Moving upward also positions my snake toward the top-center of the board, giving me space to prepare for future apples such as `(0, 7)` or potentially `(6, 3)` (depending on enemy movements).  \n\n2. **DOWN `(7, 5)`**:  \n   - Suboptimal. This takes me farther away from all apple targets and wastes valuable positional advantage.  \n\n3. **LEFT `(6, 6)`**:  \n   - Invalid. This move leads directly back into my trailing body\u2019s head segment, resulting in instant death. **No-go.**  \n\n4. **RIGHT `(8, 6)`**:  \n   - Valid but suboptimal. While safe, this ignores the immediate apple and unnecessarily bypasses the primary objective.  \n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n1. **Immediate Plan**: After consuming **`(7, 7)`**, reassess the board state.  \n   - I will see whether to move toward `(0, 7)` (a guaranteed safe apple but far away) or toward `(6, 3)` (closer but may involve Snake #0 competition).  \n   - My decision will depend on the enemy snake\u2019s movements.  \n\n2. **Priority Considerations**: Avoid getting trapped in tighter spaces, especially as my body continues to grow. Keep enough room to maneuver near the center of the board.  \n\n3. **Awareness of Snake #0**: Monitor its path carefully, especially if it begins moving toward the central-left side of the board.  \n\n---\n\n### Decided Next Move: **UP**"

Enemy **Snake #0**:  \n   - **Head**: `(6, 3)`  \n   - **Body**: `[(7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1)]`  \n   - Snake #0 is still far from me and cannot interfere with my move to `(7, 7)`. However, its proximity to the apple **`(6, 3)`** is worth monitoring.  \n\n3. **Board Layout and Apples**:  \n   - Apples at `(7, 7), (0, 7), (0, 0), (6, 3), (5, 5)`.  \n   - **(7, 7)** is the nearest apple and can be obtained immediately.  \n   - Other apples are either far away or in risky zones (e.g., **`(6, 3)`**, due to Snake #0\u2019s position).  \n\n4. **Safety**:  \n   - Moving **UP** to `(7, 7)` is fully safe and secures an apple, creating more space for me by elongating my snake.  \n   - Other moves (LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN) would either put me in an awkward position or waste a critical opportunity.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Analysis of Next Move Options**\n1. **UP** to `(7, 7)`:  \n   - **Best move**. Consumes the apple, grows my snake\u2019s length, and prepares me for further strategic moves.  \n   - Earns **1 more point.**  \n   - Keeps me centralized toward the board\u2019s top-middle area.  \n\n2. **DOWN** to `(7, 5)`:  \n   - Suboptimal. Moves away from the immediate goal and wastes a turn.  \n\n3. **LEFT** to `(6, 6)`:  \n   - Invalid. Collides with the body, causing death.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** to `(8, 6)`:  \n   - Suboptimal. This bypasses the apple `(7, 7)` and accomplishes nothing tactically useful.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Plan After Eating `(7, 7)`**\nAfter eating the apple on this move, the following options should be considered based on the updated board state:  \n1. **(6, 3)** will likely be a contested apple with Snake #0. I should monitor Snake #0\u2019s behavior and decide whether to risk pursuing it.  \n2. **(5, 5)** becomes a potential next goal, as it will be closer than the far-away apples at `(0, 7)` or `(0, 0)`.  \n3. **(0, 7)** can remain a backup plan. It is distant but safe if no better opportunities arise.  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Move: UP**"
