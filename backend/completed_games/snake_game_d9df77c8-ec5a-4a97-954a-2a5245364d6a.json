This is a safe move but doesn't immediately lead to an apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moves to (1, 5). This is also safe and closer to the apple at (4, 6).\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (2, 4). This is safe but doesn't immediately lead to an apple either.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- The snake is currently isolated and needs to grow to be a threat to the enemy. Moving down to (1, 5) will keep it in a position to potentially reach the apple at (4, 6) in the next few turns.\n- The enemy is at (6, 8), which is far from the snake's current position, so immediate threats are minimal.\n\n### Next Move:\nGiven the immediate proximity to the apple at (4, 6), moving downwards is the most strategic choice to keep the snake in a position to reach apples efficiently.\n\n**DOWN**",

UP: (6, 9) - This is within bounds and not occupied by any snake body\n2. DOWN: (6, 7) - Within bounds and empty\n3. LEFT: (5, 8) - Within bounds and empty\n4. RIGHT: (7, 8) - Within bounds and empty\n\n**Safety Check:**\nAll four moves are safe as:\n- No body segments to collide with (both snakes have no body)\n- All positions are within the 10x10 grid\n- No immediate collision with enemy head (enemy is at (1,4), far away)\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- (7,9) is closest (1 unit right and 1 unit up)\n- (7,5) is also relatively close (3 units down)\n- Other apples are farther away\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. Moving UP to (6,9) would position me near the top edge, which might limit future upward movement\n2. Moving RIGHT to (7,8) would get me closer to two apples: (7,9) and (7,5)\n3. Moving DOWN or LEFT would take me away from the nearest apples\n\n**Best Move:**\nRIGHT to (7,8) is the most strategic because:\n- It moves me closer to two apples (7,9 and 7,5)\n- It keeps me in a central position with good mobility\n- It doesn't box me into a corner\n- It maintains distance from the enemy snake\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFor the next few turns, I should:\n1. Continue moving toward the cluster of apples in the upper-right quadrant\n2. Be prepared to adjust if the enemy snake moves toward the same apples\n3. Avoid getting too close to the enemy snake to prevent head-on collisions\n4. Prioritize apples that are isolated to minimize competition\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate threats (no enemy bodies, no walls, no self-collision).\n- **Down (1,5)** is slightly better because:\n  - It keeps the snake aligned vertically toward the apple at **(4,6)** (a 3-unit vertical drop).\n  - The enemy is at **(6,8)**, far away, so no immediate collision risk.\n  - Moving right (2,4) or up (1,3) would leave the snake in a more horizontal/isolated position, making future apple access harder.\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (Next 3 Turns):**\n1. **Turn 1 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to **(1,5)**. This positions the snake to reach **(4,6)** in 3 turns (vertical drop).\n2. **Turn 2:** From **(1,5)**, move **DOWN** to **(1,6)**. Now the snake is at **(1,6)**, one cell below the apple at **(4,6)**. The enemy is still far away.\n3. **Turn 3:** Move **DOWN** to **(1,7)**. Now the snake is at **(1,7)**, and the apple at **(4,6)** is within reach if the snake grows (e.g., by eating another apple or expanding horizontally).\n   - If the snake doesn\u2019t eat the apple yet, prioritize **RIGHT** to **(2,7)** to create a longer tail and avoid being trapped vertically.\n\n**Key Risks Mitigated:**\n- The snake avoids horizontal expansion too early, which could trap it if the enemy moves aggressively.\n- The vertical path to **(4,6)** is clear and predictable.\n\n---\n**Final Move:**\nDOWN",

This positions the snake to reach **(4, 6)** in 3 turns.\n2. **Turn 2:** From **(1, 5)**, move **DOWN** to **(1, 6)**. The snake is now closer to the apple.\n3. **Turn 3:** Move **DOWN** to **(1, 7)**. If the apple hasn\u2019t been eaten yet, prioritize **RIGHT** to **(2, 7)** to expand horizontally and avoid future vertical traps.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- The snake must avoid horizontal expansion too early, as it could lead to future collisions.\n- The vertical path to **(4, 6)** remains the safest route, but we must ensure the snake doesn\u2019t get stuck.\n\n---\n**Final Move:**\nDOWN",

This positions the snake to reach **(4,6)** in 2 turns.\n2. **Turn 2:** From **(1,6)**, move **DOWN** to **(1,7)**. If the apple hasn\u2019t been eaten yet, prioritize **RIGHT** to **(2,7)** to expand horizontally and avoid future vertical traps.\n3. **Turn 3:** If the apple at **(4,6)** is still present, move **DOWN** to **(1,8)** and then **RIGHT** to **(2,8)** to explore new areas.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- The snake must prioritize the apple at **(4,6)** while avoiding the enemy\u2019s path.\n- Expanding horizontally after reaching the apple reduces the risk of getting trapped vertically.\n\n---\n**Final Move:**\nDOWN",
