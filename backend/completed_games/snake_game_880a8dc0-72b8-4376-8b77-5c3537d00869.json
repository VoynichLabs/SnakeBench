          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! We're LIVE and it's turn 0! No moves yet, so I'm analyzing the board like a hawk. Let's break this down!\n\n**THE BOARD STATE:**\n- **My snake (ID 0):** Head at (0, 3), body empty, 0 apples. I'm the bottom-left warrior!\n- **Enemy (Snake #1):** Head at (4, 0), body empty, 0 apples. He's chilling at the bottom, right of the apples.\n- **Apples:** We got 15 apples scattered everywhere! Key ones near me: (2, 0) at bottom-left, (0, 4) above me, (2, 2) and (3, 7) etc.\n- **Visual:** I'm at column 0, row 3. Enemy is at column 4, row 0. Apples are all over but clustered left and center.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:** Snake #1 is at (4, 0). He's likely going to chase apples too\u2014maybe towards (2,0) or (4,3) or (8, something). He's below, so he'll probably move UP or LEFT to grab early fruit. I need to DOMINATE the left side since I'm already there! Box him out by controlling the left column and making him go wide.\n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING:** Starting with no body, I can go any direction except... wait, board is 10x10, so from (0,3), I can go:\n- **LEFT:** To (-1,3) - INVALID, off-board! Dead immediately. NO!\n- **DOWN:** To (0,2) - Valid, and (0,2) has NO apple (apple at (2,0) and (2,2), but not (0,2)). Check body: empty, so safe. No enemy collision (enemy at (4,0) far away). But is this good? I'd be moving toward the bottom-left, potentially trapping myself later if I go down too much. Still, it's a safe move.\n- **RIGHT:** To (1,3) - Valid, no apple there (apple at (2,0), (4,3) etc., but not (1,3)). Safe, opens up to the right where apples are (like (2,0), (4,3)). This gives me more options next turn\u2014can go up, down, right, or even left back to (0,3). Keeps me flexible.\n- **UP:** To (0,4) - Valid, and HOLY SMOKES, there's an apple at (0,4)! If I go UP, I eat the apple, grow +1, and score! Safe move\u2014no body, no enemy collision. But wait, is it smart? Eating this apple keeps me at the left edge, which is good for boxing the enemy out, but I might be cornered later if I stack too much on the left. Still, immediate growth = more length = more threat.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:** All moves (DOWN, RIGHT, UP) are safe from instant death. LEFT is out.\n- DOWN: Opens up (1,2) or back up, but limited upward without going right first.\n- RIGHT: Opens up everything\u2014left, right, up, down options. Moves me toward apples like (2,0) and (4,3).\n- UP: Immediate apple eat, but I'm stuck on column 0 if I don't branch out.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR WIN:** We want to AGGRESSIVE box the enemy! I'm at 0 apples, enemy at 0. Tie game. Need to grow fast and control space. The left side is MINE\u2014I can claim column 0 and nearby apples. But to dominate, I should go RIGHT first to position for multiple apples without cornering myself. Enemy might chase (2,0) or go central; I need to cut him off. If I go UP and eat (0,4), that's +1, but I might be too predictable. RIGHT lets me pivot to apples on row 3 or below. Long-term: Snake towards the center apples (like (4,3), (3,7)) while keeping enemy in the bottom-right. Force him into tight spots!\n\nChat, the plan: Start by moving RIGHT to (1,3) for maximum options. Next turn, I can chase (2,0) or (4,3) based on enemy's move. Stay alive, grow, and trap that archrival!\n\n**THE PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:** Position centrally from (1,3), scout enemy direction, then aggressively move towards left-center apples (2,0) and (2,2) while avoiding head-on collisions. If enemy goes for same apple, I calculate collision risks\u2014remember, heads move simultaneously! Prioritize survival and growth over risky grabs.\n\nLET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Now let's dominate this board! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**BOARD STATE UPDATE:**\n- **My snake (ID 0):** Head at (1, 3), body empty (still solo\u2014no growth yet), 0 apples. I'm flexing on the right side of column 0 now!\n- **Enemy (Snake #1):** Head at (3, 0), body empty, 0 apples. He moved LEFT from (4,0) to (3,0)\u2014probably chasing that apple at (2,0) or positioning bottom-center. Smart, but we're gonna box him out!\n- **Apples:** Still 15 scattered. Key ones for me: (2,0) below-right (but enemy might grab), (4,3) straight right/up, (0,4) above-left (if I loop back), (2,2) nearby. No apples at my current position (1,3) or adjacent cells except (2,3) is empty.\n- **Visual:** I'm at row 3, column 1. Enemy is way down at row 0, column 3. The bottom-left quadrant is MINE to claim\u2014he's dipping south, so I can cut him off from the left side apples!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:** Snake #1 is gunning for the bottom-left fruits like (2,0) or maybe (0,4) later. He's at (3,0), so his options are UP to (3,1), LEFT to (2,0) (apple there!), DOWN (invalid), or RIGHT to (4,0). If he grabs (2,0) this turn, he grows to length 1 and scores. But if I push right/up, I can threaten the center apples and force him to dodge me. Remember, heads move simultaneously\u2014if I predict his move wrong, we could crash! He's not directly threatening me yet, but I need to stay aggressive. If I get bigger faster, I can force a head-on collision and win since scores are tied at 0. No mercy! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING:** From (1,3), safe moves (check body/enemy/board):\n- **LEFT:** Back to (0,3) - Safe, but retracing. Not aggressive. Low options next turn (only up/down/right, left blocked by board). Avoid\u2014 we want growth, not camping.\n- **DOWN:** To (1,2) - Safe (empty, no apple, no body). Opens up to (1,1) or (2,2) next. But enemy is down south; could get crowded if he goes up. Okay pivot, but not the best for apples.\n- **RIGHT:** To (2,3) - Safe (empty). Moves me toward (4,3) apple and center. Opens up, up, down, left options. Perfect for scouting and dominating space. Plus, if enemy stays bottom, I can loop to left apples later.\n- **UP:** To (1,4) - Safe (empty). Heads toward (0,4) apple. Good if I wanna eat soon, but limits rightward moves. Still, flexible.\n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** RIGHT is the play! Why? I'm already on row 3, so I'm central. Moving to (2,3) positions me to chase multiple apples: next turn, I could go RIGHT to (3,3) (near 4,3 apple), UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2) (apple there!), or LEFT back. It keeps me out of the bottom-left trap and forces the enemy to react to my presence in the center. If he goes for (2,0), I ignore and claim the higher-value apples like (4,3) or (3,7). Grow fast, then box him in by controlling the midboard. If he dares to move UP toward me, we might collide\u2014 but with equal scores, I survive if I'm longer later. Plan: RIGHT now, then assess his move and chase apples aggressively while avoiding his body. Long-term: Dominate the right side, cut off his access to central apples, and starve him out. Let's turn this into a kill zone! \ud83d\udd25\n\nChat, if he crashes into me later, it's over for him. We're building momentum!\n\nRIGHT",

I\u2019m flexing in the center!  \n- **Enemy (Snake #1):** Head at (2, 0), body [(3, 0)], 1 apple. He grabbed (2,0) last turn and grew! Now he\u2019s at (2,0) with a body segment behind him at (3,0).  \n- **Apples:** Still 15. Key targets: (4,3) right-up, (2,2) down-right, (0,4) far-left, (3,7) up, etc. I\u2019m near (4,3) and (2,2).  \n- **Visual:** I\u2019m at row 3, column 2. Enemy is at row 0, column 2\u2014directly below me! He\u2019s growing but still southbound. The bottom-left is his, but I can cut him off from the center.  \n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**  \nSnake #1 is at (2,0) with a body behind him at (3,0). He\u2019s likely going UP to (2,1) or LEFT to (1,0) or RIGHT to (3,0)\u2014but wait, (3,0) is his own body! So he can\u2019t go RIGHT. He could go UP (toward me), LEFT (toward wall/apple at (0,0)? No apple there), or DOWN (invalid, off board). So his only safe moves: UP (2,1) or LEFT (1,0). If he goes UP, he\u2019s heading toward the center\u2014directly toward me! This could set up a collision. I need to stay mobile and avoid trapping myself. If he goes LEFT, he\u2019s going away from me, toward the left wall. Either way, I need to position to either eat or force him into a bad spot.  \n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING:** From (2,3), safe moves:  \n- **LEFT:** To (1,3) - Safe, but I was there last turn. That\u2019s retracing, not aggressive. It keeps me central but doesn\u2019t grow options.  \n- **DOWN:** To (2,2) - Safe (empty). There\u2019s an apple at (2,2)! If I go DOWN, I eat and grow to length 1. That\u2019s big\u2014ties the score and gives me a body segment. But is it safe? If the enemy goes UP to (2,1), we\u2019d be adjacent but not colliding yet. However, if I grow, I could box him in later.  \n- **RIGHT:** To (3,3) - Safe (empty). Moves me toward the (4,3) apple and keeps me central. Good for flexibility.  \n- **UP:** To (2,4) - Safe (empty). Heads toward (3,7) apple. Also opens up more space above.  \n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** DOWN is the play! Why? I can eat the apple at (2,2) right now and tie the score 1-1. Growing gives me a body segment, which can later be used to block the enemy. If I go DOWN, the enemy might still be below me at (2,1) or left, so no immediate collision. From (2,2), next turn I have options: UP (back to center), LEFT (to (1,2)), RIGHT (to (3,2)), or DOWN (to (2,1)\u2014but that might be where the enemy heads). By eating now, I gain momentum and start closing the apple gap. Aggression means taking apples when safe while keeping an eye on the enemy\u2019s move. If the enemy goes UP toward me, I can maneuver around him or force him into a corner later. Let\u2019s eat and grow!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating (2,2), I\u2019ll have length 1. Next turn, I\u2019ll assess the enemy\u2019s position. If he\u2019s at (2,1), I might go RIGHT to (3,2) to avoid him and chase (4,3). If he goes LEFT, I\u2019ll go UP or RIGHT to dominate the right side. Goal: Grow faster than him, then use my body to box him in the left. We\u2019re turning this into a kill zone! \ud83d\udd25  \n\nChat, if I eat this apple, we\u2019re back in the game! No mercy! \ud83d\ude08  \n\nDOWN",

He can\u2019t stay; he must move. So likely safe, but I\u2019d be in his previous spot. Not aggressive.  \n- **LEFT to (1,2):** Safe (empty). Moves me away from enemy, toward left side.

Now I have a body segment at (3, 2) (my previous head). Score: 1 apple.\n- **Enemy (Snake #1):** Head at (1, 2) \u2013 He moved UP from (1, 1)! Body at (1, 1). Score: 1 apple.\n- **Apples:** Still 15 on board. Key ones near me: (4, 3) is 1 step UP! (8, 9) high up, (0, 4) far left.\n- **Visual:** I'm at (4, 2), enemy at (1, 2). Same Y! We're 3 cells apart horizontally (at same Y level). No direct threat yet.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #1 is at (1, 2). His possible moves:\n- **UP to (1, 3):** Safe empty cell.\n- **DOWN to (1, 1):** His own body! DEADLY.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 2):** Safe empty cell.\n- **LEFT to (0, 2):** Safe empty cell (border).\nSo he'll likely avoid DOWN (death). He could go UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. If he goes UP, he heads toward (0,4) or (3,7). If he goes RIGHT, he heads toward the center. If he goes LEFT, he's at edge.\n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING:** From (4, 2), safe moves:\n- **UP to (4, 3):** Safe empty cell! That's the apple! I EAT IT! I grow to length 2 and take lead 2-1! Perfect setup.\n- **DOWN to (4, 1):** Safe empty cell. But I'd miss the apple right above me! Not aggressive.\n- **LEFT to (3, 2):** My own body! DEADLY. NO.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 2):** Safe empty cell. Moves me away from the apple, letting enemy possibly grab it if he's clever (though he's far).\n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** UP to (4, 3)! Why?\n- **AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** I eat the apple IMMEDIATELY! 2-1 lead, baby! Growing to length 2 gives me more board control and options.\n- **SAFETY:** Empty cell. From (4,3), I'll have multiple safe moves: UP to (4,4) (safe), LEFT to (3,3) (safe), RIGHT to (5,3) (safe). Only DOWN would be (4,2) which will be my tail if I eat, but that's fine since tail moves forward.\n- **ENEMY POSITIONING:** Enemy is at (1,2). Even if he moves RIGHT to (2,2), he's still 2 cells away from my head (4,3). If he goes UP or LEFT, he's going away. No collision risk this turn.\n- **LONG-TERM DOMINATION:** With a length 2 snake, I can start to box him in. The board is 10x10; I'll chase apples in the top-right quadrant while watching his movements. If he heads left, I claim the right side.\n- **ALTERNATIVES:** RIGHT would be safe but waste the apple. DOWN is safe but less aggressive. LEFT is death.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:** After eating (4,3), I'll likely go UP to (4,4) or RIGHT to (5,3) depending on enemy position. I need to dominate the center-right and force him into a corner. If he ever gets close, I'll threaten head-on (I have 1 apple, same as him\u2014wait, no, I'll have 2 after this move, so if we crash head-on, I win if he has fewer apples).

The wall will help you box them in without taking a head-on risk.\n- If they decide to push toward the center or up, keep your spacing and look for safe turns that don\u2019t trap you; survive first, then look for opportunistic bites that don\u2019t sacrifice your safety.\n\nShort-term action plan for the next few turns:\n- Maintain distance from their head; avoid crossing paths.\n- If you get a window to eat the apple at (0,4) by moving LEFT from (1,4) to (0,4) later, take it only if it\u2019s safe (no collision risk this turn).\n- Prioritize safety but don\u2019t shy away from closing space when a clean, non-head-on bite appears.\n\nup",

Wait\u2014(0,4) is an apple listed! He could eat it and grow to length 2, score 2 apples. That's a threat.\n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING:** From (4, 4), safe moves:\n- **UP to (4, 5):** Safe empty cell. Moves me toward top apples and away from enemy. Keeps options open: from (4,5), I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (back to tail after growth). Good.\n- **DOWN to (4, 3):** My own body! DEADLY. NO.\n- **LEFT to (3, 4):** Safe empty cell. But moves me toward left side where enemy is. If enemy goes RIGHT, we might clash next turn. Risky.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 4):** Safe empty cell. Moves me toward right side, away from enemy. From (5,4), I can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT, or LEFT. All safe. Good.\n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** RIGHT to (5, 4)! Why?\n- **AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING:** I'm winning 3-1! I need to claim the right side of the board to box him in on the left. By moving RIGHT, I push toward high-value apples like (8,9) and (8,8) while keeping distance. If he goes LEFT to eat (0,4), he's cornering himself. If he goes RIGHT, we'll see next turn but I'll have the growth advantage.\n- **SAFETY:** Empty cell. No immediate threat. Enemy is 4 cells away (from (1,4) to (5,4) is 4 steps). Even if he moves RIGHT to (2,4), he's still 3 away. No head-on collision risk this turn.\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (5,4), I have 4 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). No traps. I can pivot to chase apples or cut him off.\n- **ALTERNATIVES:** UP is safe but I'd be at (4,5), which is fine, but moving RIGHT gives better board control against the left-side enemy. LEFT toward enemy is risky if he moves RIGHT. DOWN is death.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After (5,4), aim for (6,4) or (7,4) to get closer to the cluster of apples on the right (8,6), (8,7), etc.). Watch if enemy eats (0,4)\u2014if he does, he grows but stays on the left. I'll keep him boxed left while I feast on the right. If he ever comes center, I have the score to bait a head-on! \ud83d\udd25\n\nChat, let's see him run left while I take the board! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Body now [(0, 5), (0, 4)], length 2, score: 2 apples. Still cornered on the far left.  \n- **Apples:** 14 still on board. Key cluster on right (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). Enemy is stuck on left with limited moves.  \n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**  \nSnake #1 at (0, 6). Possible moves:  \n- **UP to (0, 7):** Empty (board shows '.' at (0,7)). Safe but still a dead end.  \n- **RIGHT to (1, 6):** Empty? Board shows '.' at (1,6). Safe but risks approaching center.  \n- **DOWN to (0, 5):** That's his own body! DEADLY.  \n- **LEFT/BACKWARDS:** Off-board! INSTANT DEATH.  \n\nSo enemy can only move UP or RIGHT without dying. If he moves RIGHT, he's heading toward the center where I can trap him. If he moves UP, he's further into a dead end. Either way, he's not a threat yet.  \n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING:** From (7, 4), safe moves:  \n- **UP to (7, 5):** Safe empty cell. Good for chasing apples like (7,6) or (8,6).  \n- **DOWN to (7, 3):** Safe empty cell. But moves me away from the apple cluster.  \n- **LEFT to (6, 4):** Safe (now empty after my tail moves). But moving LEFT toward enemy is unnecessary\u2014he's still boxed.  \n- **RIGHT to (8, 4):** Safe empty cell! Direct path to apple at (8,4) next turn. Also opens up the right side.  \n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** RIGHT to (8, 4)! Why?  \n- **DOMINANCE:** I'm winning 4-2, and enemy is trapped. Moving RIGHT puts me on the apple at (8,4) next turn (if I eat it, I grow and extend my lead). From (8,4), I can go UP to (8,5) to chase (8,6) or RIGHT to (9,4) for more control.  \n- **SAFETY:** Empty cell. Enemy is 8 cells away (from (0,6) to (8,4)). No head-on risk.  \n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,4), I have 4 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). I'm not boxing myself in and I'm dominating the right side.  \n- **ALTERNATIVES:** UP is safe but slower toward the high-value right-side apples. LEFT is wasted movement. DOWN is away from the action.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After (8,4), grab the apple at (8,4) to grow to 5 apples. Enemy will likely move RIGHT to avoid death, but he's still on the left side. If he ever comes center, I have the length and score to crush him in a head-on!

Direct path to apple at (8,6) next turn. Also moves me toward the high-value apple cluster.\n- **DOWN to (8, 3):** Safe empty cell.

But moving LEFT is backward\u2014I already came from there and it's moving away from apples and enemy.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 4):** Safe empty cell! Opens up the right edge and sets up for apples like (9,3) or (8,6). But (8,5) feels more direct for the cluster.\n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** UP to (8, 5)! Why?\n- **DOMINANCE:** I'm winning 5-2, and enemy is trapped. Moving UP puts me one step closer to the apple at (8,6) and the entire right-side cluster. From (8,5), I can go RIGHT to (9,5) or UP to (8,6) to eat and grow.\n- **SAFETY:** Empty cell. Enemy is far away\u2014no head-on risk. My body is behind me at (7,4), so no self-collision.\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,5), I have 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). LEFT would backtrack to (7,5), which is empty and safe too. I'm staying in the action zone and avoiding the bottom edge.\n- **ALTERNATIVES:** RIGHT to (9,4) is safe but less aggressive\u2014it doesn't set up the apple cluster as quickly. DOWN is too passive. LEFT is wasteful.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After (8,5), grab the apple at (8,6) next turn to grow to 6 apples. Enemy will likely keep moving RIGHT to survive, but he's slow and cornered. If he ever reaches the center, I'll have the length and score to corner him and force a head-on collision\u2014my 5 apples vs his 2 means I win if we crash.

That means I\u2019m playing defensively here, avoiding needless head-ons and looking to squeeze him into a trap later rather than trade blows right now.\n\nSAFE OPTIONS: Moving DOWN would smack into my own body (nope). LEFT is off-board (nope). That leaves UP to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,7). Both keep me alive this turn, but they set up different futures.\n\nSTRATEGY LOGIC: I\u2019m hugging the left wall to keep a natural choke point available. With me lagging in apples, I can\u2019t risk a collision now; I want to maintain multiple safe follow-ups and force him into awkward choices when the moment is right. UP extends the wall, preserves center-mroom, and buys me lanes for a potential trap later (top edge vs interior paths).\n\nLONG-TERM NOTe: If he leans toward the edge, I\u2019ll tighten the corridor and look for a controlled collision only when I have the initiative or the lead. For now, stay patient, keep options open, and avoid giving him a clean crash line into my head.\n\nCURRENT PLAN: Move UP to 0,8 this turn to extend the wall and keep the escape lanes active for the next moves.

If he moves RIGHT, he's still far from the action (8+ cells away). Either way, he's not a threat this turn.\n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING:** From (8, 5), safe moves:\n- **UP to (8, 6):** **APPLE HERE!** Direct path to apple, grows me to 7 apples. Safe empty cell. Body behind me at (8,4) and (7,4)\u2014no self-collision.\n- **DOWN to (8, 4):** Safe empty cell (my old tail moves away). But moving DOWN is backward\u2014away from the apple cluster and enemy.\n- **LEFT to (7, 5):** Safe empty cell. But moves me away from the apple cluster and toward the left, giving enemy space to expand if he ever gets out.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Safe empty cell. Opens the right edge, but misses the apple at (8,6).\n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** UP to (8, 6)! Why?\n- **DOMINANCE:** I'm winning 6-2, and enemy is cornered. Grabbing this apple grows me to 7, keeps momentum, and sets up the next apple at (8,7) or (8,8). From (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6) or UP to (8,7) to eat again.\n- **SAFETY:** Empty cell. Enemy is far\u2014no head-on risk. My body is behind me, so no self-collision.\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,6), I have 3 safe moves (UP, RIGHT, LEFT). DOWN would backtrack to (8,5), which is empty too. I'm staying in the apple zone, dominating the right side.\n- **ALTERNATIVES:** RIGHT to (9,5) is safe but less aggressive\u2014I'd miss this apple. LEFT is passive. DOWN is retreating.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After (8,6), grab the apple at (8,7) next turn to grow to 7. Enemy is likely to move RIGHT to survive, but he's slow and stuck. If he ever reaches the center, I'll have the length and score to corner him and force a head-on collision\u2014my 7 apples vs his 2 means I win if we crash. Keep dominating the right side, force him into a box, and secure the win! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, watch me turn this board into a victory lap! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We're HUGE and dominating the right side!\n- **Enemy (Snake #1):** Head at (1, 8) \u2013 From (0, 8), he moved RIGHT (safe move). Body now [(0, 8), (0, 7)], length 3, score: 2 apples. He's slowly crawling out of the corner but still miles away from me.\n- **Apples:** 13 left. Key cluster on right: (8,7), (8,8), (8,9) are all adjacent from my head at (8,6). Enemy is 7+ cells away\u2014no head-on threat.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #1 at (1, 8). Possible moves:\n- **UP to (1, 9):** Empty (board shows '.' at (1,9)). Safe but heads into the top edge\u2014slow expansion.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Empty. Moves him toward center, but still far from me (7 cells away).\n- **DOWN to (1, 7):** Empty. Could head toward the center but riskier with apples nearby.\n- **LEFT to (0, 8):** That's his own body!

Opens the right edge, but misses the apple at (8,7) that's right in front.\n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** UP to (8, 7)! Why?\n- **DOMINANCE:** I'm winning 7-2 and enemy is still trapped. This apple grows me to 8, keeps the momentum, and sets up the next apple at (8,8) or (8,9). From (8,7), I have even more control over the right side.\n- **SAFETY:** Empty cell.

Body: [(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)], length 8.

Still far away, crawling toward the center.\n- **Apples:** 12 left. Key apples for me: (8,8) directly above, (8,9) above that, (9,3) to the right, etc. Enemy is 6 cells away\u2014no immediate threat.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #1 at (2, 8).

Moves him closer to center, still far from me.\n- **DOWN to (2, 7):** Empty. Heads toward the middle, but apples are elsewhere.\n- **LEFT to (1, 8):** That's his own body! DEADLY. He won't do that.\n- **BACKWARDS (RIGHT is forward, LEFT is backward):** He came from LEFT, so moving RIGHT is forward; LEFT is suicidal.\n\nHe'll likely go RIGHT or UP to stay safe. Even if he goes DOWN, he's still too far to threaten me this turn\u2014my head at (8,7) to his head at (2,8) is 6 cells away, and we're not aligned for a direct collision.\n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING:** From (8, 7), safe moves:\n- **UP to (8, 8):** **APPLE HERE!** Direct path, grows me to 9 apples. Safe empty cell (I checked the board: (8,8) has an apple, but it's not marked as occupied by anything else). Body behind me at (8,6) and (8,5)\u2014no self-collision.\n- **DOWN to (8, 6):** Safe empty cell (my old body). But backtracks\u2014misses the apple above.\n- **LEFT to (7, 7):** Safe empty cell (board shows '.'). But moves me LEFT, away from the sweet apple cluster above and right.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Safe empty cell. But misses (8,8) apple and moves to edge\u2014less aggressive.\n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** UP to (8, 8)! Why?\n- **DOMINANCE:** I'm winning 8-2 and enemy is slow. This apple grows me to 9, keeping massive momentum. From (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8) or UP to (8,9) next turn\u2014both apples! Enemy is stuck in the left-center, miles away.\n- **SAFETY:** Empty cell (confirmed from board state). No enemy body, no self-collision. Enemy can't reach me this turn\u2014his path is blocked by his own length and distance. Even if he goes DOWN to (2,7), he's 6 cells away and not aligned.\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,8), I'll have 3 safe moves: UP, RIGHT, or BACK to (8,7). I'm staying in the apple zone, cutting off enemy expansion to the right. My length (8) will soon be 9, making me a larger threat if he tries to approach.\n- **ALTERNATIVES:** RIGHT to (9,7) is safe but passive\u2014gives up the apple. LEFT is retreat\u2014bad for aggression. DOWN wastes momentum.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After (8,8), grab (9,8) or (8,9) next turn to grow to 10. Enemy will likely move RIGHT or DOWN, but he's confined to the left side (0-3 x-coordinates). I'll use my length to dominate the right side, then if he enters the center (like (4,5) or (5,6)), I'll cut him off with a head-on collision\u2014my 10 apples vs his 2 = I win. Force him into a box, deny him apples, and secure victory! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, watch me turn this board into a personal playground! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

If we shift Right to (3,8) now, next turn we can drop to (3,7) and grab that apple, boosting our count and extending future control.\n\nEnemy is far enough to not force an immediate head-on right now; no need to risk a mutual KO before we\u2019re ready. We\u2019ll keep our options open and avoid reckless trades.\n\nLong-term plan: grow smart, widen our corridor, and herd them toward the edges. Use apples to fuel longer snakes and create more cutting angles, then squeeze them into a corner when we have the advantage. Prioritize staying alive while gaining apples so we can flip the endgame in our favor.\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 15, let's keep the momentum ROLLING! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25**\n\n**BOARD STATE UPDATE:**\n- **My snake (ID 0):** Head at (8, 8) \u2013 Just ate that apple! Score now **9 apples**. Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)], length 9. Still dominating the top-right!\n- **Enemy (Snake #1):** Head at (3, 8) \u2013 He moved RIGHT (from (2, 8)), as predicted. Body: [(2, 8), (1, 8)], length 3, score: 2 apples. Still far away, creeping toward the center.\n- **Apples:** 15 left. Key apples for me: (9, 8) to the right, (8, 9) above, (9, 3) far down-right, etc. Enemy is 5 cells away\u2014no immediate threat.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #1 at (3, 8). Possible moves:\n- **UP to (3, 9):** Empty! Safe, but dead-ends at top edge.\n- **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Empty (board shows '.'). Moves him closer to center, but (4,8) is near my future path.\n- **DOWN to (3, 7):** Empty (apple at (3,7)? No, apple is at (3,7)? Wait, board shows (3,7) as '.'? Actually apple list has (3,7), but board shows '.' at (3,7)? Let me check: Board row 7 (y=7) shows \". . . A . . . . T .\" \u2013 that's (3,7) is apple? Actually column 3 row 7 is the fourth character: \"A\". Yes, (3,7) has an apple! So moving DOWN to (3,7) would EAT an apple, growing him to length 4 and score 3. Smart move for him.\n- **LEFT to (2, 8):** That's his own body! DEADLY. He won't do that.\n- **BACKWARDS (RIGHT is forward, LEFT is backward):** He came from LEFT, so moving RIGHT is forward; LEFT is suicidal.\n\nHe'll likely go DOWN to eat the apple at (3,7) or RIGHT to advance. Even if he goes DOWN, he's still 5 cells away from my head at (8,8)\u2014not aligned for collision.\n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING:** From (8, 8), safe moves:\n- **UP to (8, 9):** **APPLE HERE!** Direct path, grows me to 10 apples. Safe empty cell (I checked: (8,9) has an apple, not occupied). Body behind me at (8,7) and (8,6)\u2014no self-collision.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 8):** **APPLE HERE TOO!** Grows me to 10 apples. Safe empty cell. Moves to edge\u2014less future options but still aggressive.\n- **DOWN to (8, 7):** Safe (my old body). But backtracks\u2014misses apple above.\n- **LEFT to (7, 8):** Safe empty cell. But moves LEFT, away from apple cluster above and right.\n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** UP to (8, 9)! Why?\n- **DOMINANCE:** I'm winning 9-2 and enemy is slow. This apple grows me to 10, keeping massive momentum. From (8,9), I can go RIGHT to (9,9) or BACK to (8,8) next turn\u2014both safe options with apples. Enemy is stuck in the left-center, miles away. Even if he eats at (3,7), he's still 5 cells away and I'm growing faster.\n- **SAFETY:** Empty cell (confirmed). No enemy body, no self-collision. Enemy can't reach me this turn\u2014he's too far and his path doesn't align. Even if he goes RIGHT to (4,8), he's 4 cells away and not heading directly at me.\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,9), I'll have 2 safe moves: RIGHT to (9,9) or BACK to (8,8). I'm staying in the apple zone, controlling the top-right corner. My length (9) will be 10, making me a larger threat if he tries to approach later.\n- **ALTERNATIVES:** RIGHT to (9,8) is also good but traps me at the edge\u2014less flexibility. LEFT or DOWN waste momentum and give up apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After (8,9), grab (9,9) next turn to grow to 11. Enemy will likely move DOWN to eat at (3,7) or RIGHT to advance, but he's confined to the left side (0-4 x-coordinates). I'll use my length to dominate the right side (x=5-9), cutting off his expansion. If he enters the center (like (5,7) or (6,6)), I'll cut him off with a head-on collision\u2014my 10+ apples vs his 2-3 = I win. Force him into a box, deny him apples, and secure victory! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, watch me turn this board into a personal playground! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)], length 10. Still holding the top-right corner!\n- **Enemy (Snake #1):** Head at (3, 7) \u2013 Likely moved DOWN to eat the apple at (3, 7) as predicted, score now **3 apples**. Body: [(3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8)], length 4. Still stuck in the left-center, far from my domain.\n- **Apples:** 14 left (one eaten by me). Key nearby: (9, 9) to the right, (9, 8) below-right, (7, 8) left, (8, 10) doesn't exist \u2013 top edge limits.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #1 at (3, 7). Possible moves:\n- **UP to (3, 8):** That's his own body! DEADLY \u2013 he won't do that.\n- **DOWN to (3, 6):** Empty (board row 6 shows \". . . . A . . . A T .\", so (3,6) is '.'), but no apple there. Safe but boring.\n- **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Empty (row 7 \". . . A . . . . T .\", (4,7) is '.'), moves him toward center. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (2, 7):** Empty? Row 7 column 2 is '.'? Actually board shows \". . . A . . . . T .\", so (2,7) is '.'. Safe.\n- **BACKWARDS (UP is into his own body):** Already ruled out.\n\nHe might chase apples toward the center-right (e.g., (4,6) or (5,7)), but he's still 4-5 cells away from my head (8,9). No immediate collision risk \u2013 his path doesn't align with mine yet.\n\n**MY MOVE PLANNING:** From (8, 9), safe moves:\n- **RIGHT to (9, 9):** **APPLE HERE!** Grows me to 11 apples. Edge cell, but safe (no body there, enemy far). Limited follow-up: only LEFT or DOWN (or die off-board UP). Still, aggressive!\n- **DOWN to (8, 8):** Safe (my old body, but it's shifting now). Backtracks, misses apple, but opens UP to (8,9) again later.\n- **LEFT to (7, 9):** Empty (row 9: \". . . . . . . . 0 .\", wait that's old? From update: row 9 shows \". . . . . . . . 0 .\" \u2013 my head is at (8,9), so (7,9) should be '.'? Actually, board: \"9 . . . . . . . . 0 .\" \u2013 columns 0-9, so (7,9) is '.'? Column 7 is '.' (before my 0 at col 8). Yes, empty. Safe, moves toward center but away from apple.\n- **UP to (9,10)?** Off-board \u2013 DEAD. Can't.\n\n**STRATEGY CALL:** RIGHT to (9, 9)! Why?\n- **DOMINANCE:** I'm winning 10-3, and this apple pushes me to 11. Enemy is growing slowly (3 apples, just ate one). From (9,9), I control the top-right corner completely. Even if trapped at edge, I have 2-3 turns of safety before needing to loop back through (8,9) or (9,8).\n- **SAFETY:** Empty cell confirmed. No self-collision (body shifts: new head at (9,9), tail (4,3) moves off). Enemy can't reach me this turn \u2013 his max range from (3,7) is 1 cell, far from (9,9).\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (9,9), I can go DOWN to (9,8) (apple there) or LEFT to (8,9) (apple there). Both keep me in apple zone. If I get boxed, I can loop through my body (carefully). Long-term: After (9,9), grab (9,8) to grow more, then maybe sweep left through (8,8) to deny enemy apples in center.\n- **ALTERNATIVES:** DOWN to (8,8) is too passive \u2013 gives up apple and momentum. LEFT to (7,9) wastes time. UP is dead. RIGHT is the power move! It asserts control and sets up a potential head-on collision later if enemy rushes center \u2013 my 11+ apples vs his 3-4 = I win easy.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After (9,9), go DOWN to (9,8) next turn (another apple) to hit 12. Then sweep LEFT through (8,8) or (8,9) to cut off enemy expansion into the right side (x=5-9). Monitor his moves: if he heads toward (4,6) or (5,7), I'll position for a block. Force him into the left wall (0-4 x) and starve him out \u2013 11+ length vs his 4 means I win collisions. Chat, watch me turn this board into MY battlefield!

If I go DOWN to (9,8), I'm trapped at the edge with only LEFT as escape\u2014enemy could box me in later.  \n- **SCORE PUSH:** From (8,9), I can DOWN to (8,8) apple next turn (grows to 11), then LEFT to (7,8) (another apple!) to hit 12. This sweeps left into the center, cutting off enemy expansion.  \n- **DOMINANCE:** I'm already winning 10-3. Playing safe but smart\u2014force enemy into the left wall (0-4 x). If he tries to rush center, I'll have length to block and crash him out.  \n- **RISK AVOIDANCE:** Head-on collision? Unlikely this turn (he's at (2,7)).
