LET'S GET THIS BREAD! \ud83d\ude08\n\nOur head is chilling at (6, 2). The board is a beautiful 10x10 grid of opportunity! Look at those apples scattered around! (1, 2) and (3, 2) are super close! We need to start munching immediately, build some length, and start boxing that snake!\n\nLet's assess the immediate battlefield.\n\n**Where is the enemy?**\nSnake #1 is way over at (9, 5). They've got a whole lot of empty space next to them before they hit the edge! They are in no immediate danger, and neither are we.\n\n**What are our options from (6, 2)?**\n1. **UP to (6, 3):** Safe. Moves towards apple (3, 6) eventually, but mostly towards no immediate threat.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 1):** Safe. Moves slightly away from the action in the center.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 2):** Safe. Moves towards the cluster of apples on the left side (1, 2), (3, 2). That looks juicy!\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Safe. Doesn't seem to gain much immediate advantage.\n\n**Analyzing Apple Proximity:**\nThe nearest delicious snacks are (1, 2) and (3, 2). To get there efficiently, moving LEFT seems like the best strategy, putting us at (5, 2).\n\n**Considering Enemy Movement (The Simultaneous Threat):**\nSince they are at (9, 5), where could they go?\n*   UP to (9, 6)\n*   DOWN to (9, 4)\n*   LEFT to (8, 5) (Gaining ground towards the center)\n*   RIGHT (Game Over, off the board!)\n\nIf they go LEFT to (8, 5), they are moving towards the middle and maybe setting up a long-term trap, but for now, they are far away! We don't need to dodge them this turn, we need to hunt apples!\n\n**The Plan:** We need to start building our body so we can fence this guy in later! Right now, we are aiming for the left side apples. Moving $\\text{LEFT}$ to $(5, 2)$ puts us one step closer to $(3, 2)$ and $(1, 2)$. It keeps us central enough to pivot later, and it's 100% safe!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Initial goal is to aggressively target the tight cluster of apples on the left side (1, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1). Build a quick length advantage so we can start forcing #1 into the wall on an open board! No risky plays yet; we establish dominance through hunger!\n\nMy intuition says LEFT is the move to capitalize on the early game setup! Let's GOOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Let's BREAK IT DOWN step by step before we strike!\n\nFirst off, analyzing the board: We're starting hot at the top-right, head at (9,5) with NO body\u2014pure freedom! \ud83d\udd7a Opposition is chilling at (6,2), no body either. Apples are scattered like gems: loads down low and mid-board, clusta around the left side (yeah, (5,5) is RIGHT in line with our row?), and some toppers we gotta eye. No immediate collisions risk since we're in different zones... yet. \ud83d\ude0f We move SIMO, remember, so every choice counts to dodge that head-on KO!\n\nPossible moves from (9,5)? Let's ELIMINATE the TRASH:\n\n- UP: Straight to y=10, OFF THE GRID\u2014boom, instant L! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80\n\n- RIGHT: x=10, same screw-up, bye-bye board! \ud83d\udeab\n\n- DOWN: To (9,4), looks clear\u2014no walls, no bodies, no apples there, but opens easy runs south! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n- LEFT: To (8,5), also clear\u2014entry to the mid-board, away from edges! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nLEFT and DOWN are SAFE and SOLID. Now, wheighing the GOOD stuff: Gotta BOOST our EAT game and KEEP doors open for FUTURE domination! \ud83d\udcc8 Both got multiple follow-ups (DOWN: keep down, left, right later; LEFT: back right? Nah, but left/right/up/down opens lanes). We want to SLIDE closer to apples without painting ourselves into a corner or setting up enemy traps. UP is death, RIGHT is cocky gamble\u2014nah.\n\nStrategically? We're plotting a SNEAKY SLITHER leftish to chew row 5 apples like (5,5) without crowding the enemy at first\u2014they're row 2-3 level, so LEFT opens westward options, building space while heading toward that mid-left apple cluster (think (3,5), (3,6), etc.). DON'T go DOWN yet, as it brings us CLOSER vertically to the foe's domain\u2014let 'EM waste turns crashing north! We're grinding CONTENT, viewers! Apple count? We're tied 0-0, but ONE EAT and we're ahead! \ud83d\udd25 Who's with me to BOX THIS BOZO IN LATER? \ud83d\ude4c\n\nRhetorically: Ain't we gonna CRUSH this guy by eating smarter and faster? \ud83d\ude08\n\nLONG-TERM STRAT FOR MYSELF (NEXT TURNS ALERT!): Early game\u2014PRIORITY snagging row 5 apples (5,5) then (3,5)via LEFT-LEFT-LEFT path, build body FAST for defense/blocking. STAY HIGH-MID to avoid bottom farms where enemy lurks\u2014SWERVE them toward walls if they chase up! FLEX around\trow 6-7 for (3,6),(5,7) later, trapping them low if they commit south. IF they head right, WE LOOP BACK and EAT THEIR DROPS. Win via 30 apples OR solo survivor\u2014don't die dumb!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS UP CHAT! We are locked in! LAST turn, we committed to the **LEFT**! We are making our way to that juicy left-side apple cluster! Let's see where the chips fell!\n\nWait a minute... My previous move was **LEFT**, but my head coordinates are STILL at **(5, 2)** from the board state description? That means the LAST turn's move hasn't been processed yet, or the board state reflects the position *before* the last move, but the turn counter implies we are moving into Turn 1 now! Looking at the board state and the previous rationale, my head was at (6, 2) going into the last decision, and the board shows (5, 2) for \"Your Snake (ID: 0)\".\n\nAh, I see the confusion! The RATIONALE describes the move *before* the game state shown. The game state shown is the *start* of Turn 1, and the *last move recorded* was **LEFT**. This means my head *started* Turn 1 at (5, 2), having moved LEFT from (6, 2) in the non-recorded Turn 0. Let's re-examine the starting position vs the recorded move.\n\n**STARTING POSITION BEFORE TURN 1 (Based on Board State):**\nHead: (5, 2)\nLast Move Picked in Rationale: LEFT (which supposedly took us from (6, 2) to (5, 2))\n\nIf the board state provided is the result of the last move resolving, we are currently at (5, 2). We are on **Turn: 1 / 150**. Since our body is empty, we don't need to worry about hitting ourselves backward yet!\n\n**Target Assessment:**\nOur Head is at (5, 2).\nNearest Apples: (1, 2), (9, 8) is far, (3, 2) is excellent! (1, 0) is also close.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\nHead: (8, 5). A bit passive, sitting near the right wall.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (From (5, 2)):**\n1. **UP to (5, 3):** Safe. No walls, no body.\n2. **DOWN to (5, 1):** Safe. No walls, no body.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 2):** Safe. Moves closer to the apple cluster!\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 2):** Safe. Moving away from the cluster slightly, towards the center.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (From (8, 5)):**\nThey are far away! They are likely heading towards the top-right apples (8, 9) or (9, 9).\nPossible moves for #1: UP (to 8, 6), DOWN (to 8, 4), LEFT (to 7, 5). RIGHT is a suicide move.\n\nIf #1 goes LEFT to (7, 5), they are moving closer to the center. If they go UP to (8, 6), they are moving towards the apple hoard up top.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR TURN 1:**\nWe nailed the initial positioning by moving LEFT. Now we must capitalize on that! We are perfectly positioned to dive towards the apples at (3, 2) and (1, 2).\n\nMoving **LEFT to (4, 2)** keeps us on the aggressive path towards the best density of food on the left side. It's still completely safe, and it puts us in a prime spot for the next turn to either go LEFT again or dip DOWN towards (1, 0).\n\nMoving UP or DOWN is too slow for initial food acquisition! We need length to start boxing that lonely snake!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** SECURE the left/bottom cluster ((1, 2), (3, 2), (1, 0)). Build a body 3-4 segments long, then aggressively cut off Snake #1's potential paths towards the middle, forcing them into the perimeter walls where we can execute the squeeze! They have too much open space right now\u2014we must shrink the map for them!\n\nI see nothing but LEFT in this immediate future! Let's get that first apple!\n\nLEFT",

If they go LEFT to (7, 5), they are getting closer to us.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR TURN 2:**\nTHIS IS IT! We need to eat! The move **LEFT** takes us directly to apple (3, 2)! Eating this apple is HUGE! We get longer, we get points, and we solidify our position near that bottom-left cluster! Since Snake #1 is so far away (8, 5) vs our (4, 2), grabbing food is infinitely more important than trying to pre-emptively block them right now. We must get BIG fast! We will transition into boxing mode once we have some tail to work with!\n\nMove LEFT, get the apple, and let's see how massive we become! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:** Secure (3, 2) now. Next turn, assess if (1, 2) or (1, 0) is the best follow-up. If Snake #1 tries to come central, we use our new length to cut them off from the top half of the board!

We are feeling DANGEROUS! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK (Turn 3 / 150):**\nMy Head: (3, 2). My Body: [(4, 2), (3, 2)]. Length 2. Apples: 2! LET'S GOOO!\nEnemy Head (#1): We don't know their move yet! We have to predict it!\n\n**RECAP OF APPLE CONSUMED:**\nMy move was LEFT, from (4, 2) to (3, 2). I ate the apple there. My new head is (3, 2). My tail is now (4, 2). My body is [(3, 2), (4, 2)]. Wait, my body list configuration is HEAD-TO-TAIL.\nIf I was at (4, 2) and moved LEFT to (3, 2) and ATE an apple:\nNew Head: (3, 2).\nOld Head (4, 2) becomes Body[0].\nOld Body[0] (Tail) gets dropped because we Grew.\nSo, Head (3, 2). Body: [(4, 2)]. Wait, that's what the start state says for *my* move: Head (3, 2), Body [(4, 2)]. That implies my previous (Turn 1) position (4, 2) is still my tail, which means I DID NOT eat on Turn 2!\n\n***CRITICAL RE-EVALUATION OF LAST TURN'S RATIONALE VS STATE INPUT!***\n\nThe input states:\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (3, 2), Body: [(4, 2)], Apples collected: 1.\n\nMy rationale for Turn 2 said I moved LEFT onto apple (3, 2) and ate it!\nIf I ate it, my length should be 2, and my old head (4, 2) should be part of the body, and I should have 2 apples.\n\nLet's check the state provided for TURN 3:\nApples collected: 1. Head: (3, 2). Body: [(4, 2)]. This means I *DID NOT* eat on Turn 2! I must have moved to (3, 2) but the apple wasn't there, or I moved elsewhere!\n\nLet's re-read my Turn 2 rationale:\n\"LEFT to (3, 2): \ud83d\udea8 **EAT THE APPLE (3, 2)!** Grow!\"\nIf I moved LEFT from (4, 2), I landed on (3, 2). The apple list shows (3, 2) WAS an apple. Why didn't I eat it according to the provided INITIAL STATE for Turn 3?\n\nAh, MAJOR LORE BREAKDOWN! The provided state is *AFTER* my move on Turn 2, but *BEFORE* the move for Turn 3. The state shows:\nT2 Start: Head (4, 2). T2 End (Current Head): (3, 2). Body: [(4, 2)]. Apple Count: 1.\nThis means my move on T2, which I rationalized as LEFT, must have resulted in landing on (3, 2) but maybe the apple *wasn't there* or my coordinates got messed up in the RATIONALE process vs the actual game execution that led to this state!\n\n**IGNORE MY RATIONALE FOR T2, trust the provided CURRENT STATE for T3.**\nI moved from (4, 2) to (3, 2) last turn. I did NOT eat, as my apple count remained 1, and my length is still 1 (Head + 1 body segment = 2 total blocks, Length 1 means 1 apple). My body is [(4, 2)], meaning my tail is (4, 2).\n\nMy current size is small! Length 2.\n\nOk, back to business! Turn 3!\nMy Head is (3, 2). My body segment is (4, 2).\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\nSnake #1 Head: (6, 5). Body: none (Length 1). They are far, far away.\n\n**APPLE PRIORITY NEAR (3, 2):**\n1. (1, 2) - Very close, two steps away.\n2. (3, 1) - One step away! **CRITICAL TARGET!**\n3. (1, 0) - Further.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK AROUND (3, 2):**\n*   **UP to (3, 3):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 1):** **EAT APPLE (3, 1)!** This is the move! If this is safe, we take it NOW! Length up, score up!\n*   **LEFT to (2, 2):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 2):** **DANGER!** This is my own body segment/tail from last turn! Moving RIGHT means moving BACKWARDS into my own body! **DEAD MOVE!**\n\n**PREDICTING ENEMY MOVE (#1 at 6, 5):**\nThey are in the middle zone. They probably want to go towards the massive cluster of apples (8, 9), (9, 9), (7, 4), etc.\nLikely moves: UP to (6, 6) or RIGHT to (7, 5).\n\nIf they go UP to (6, 6): We are safe.\nIf they go RIGHT to (7, 5): We are safe.\n\nSince they are so far away (3, 2 vs 6, 5), we have zero collision risk this turn. ABSOLUTE PRIORITY: EAT THE NEAREST APPLE (<2 distance) that doesn't kill us.\n\nMove selection: **DOWN** takes us to (3, 1) and eats apple (3, 1)! This extends us towards the bottom edge and sets us up for (1, 0) next!\n\n**STRATEGY FOR TURN 3:**\nGet BIG FAST! Eat (3, 1) down below! We must capitalize on our early mobility before the board clutters. We confirm that moving RIGHT (4, 2) is suicide because that's where our tail *is* (or where my head was last turn, which is now the segment behind me). (3, 2) -> (4, 2) is moving backwards! A classic rookie error to avoid! DOWN is the only instant-gratification move that is safe.\n\nLong-Term Plan Note: Eat (3, 1) to grow. Next turn, if safe, we aim directly for (1, 2) to start sweeping the left side clean. We need to push Snake #1 towards the top-right corner (Y=8/9) so we can claim the entire bottom/middle!\n\nDOWN it is! Let's get this bread! \ud83c\udf5e\n\nDOWN",

I just reviewed the rationale I wrote for the *last* move (Turn 3) and I *executed* that move in the rationale, but the current state tells me that was T4 start!\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Turn 4 / 150):**\nMy Head: (3, 1)\nMy Body: [(3, 2), (4, 2)]\nApples collected: 2. *(Wait, my last move rationale said I moved to (3, 1) and ate the apple there, which would make my apple count 2. The state confirms APPLE COUNT 2! So my MOVE on T3 WAS successful and I ATE (3, 1)!)*\n\nMy Last Move (T3) was DOWN, resulting in Head at (3, 1). I ATE the apple (3, 1)!\nNew Body: [(3, 2) from old head, (4, 2) from old body[0]]. This matches: [(3, 2), (4, 2)]. PERFECT! I grew and survived! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**ENEMY POSITION (Snake #1 at T4 Start):**\nHead: (5, 5). Body: [(6, 5)]. They are still chilling. They likely moved from (5, 5) on T3, but we don't know where! We must assume the WORST case safety analysis based on where they *could* have moved!\n\nIf Snake #1 moved UP on T3: (5, 6).\nIf Snake #1 moved DOWN on T3: (5, 4).\nIf Snake #1 moved LEFT on T3: (4, 5) - DANGER!\nIf Snake #1 moved RIGHT on T3: (6, 5) - This matches the body! Wait, if they moved RIGHT to (6, 5) and *didn't* eat, their body should be [(5, 5)]! The input says their body is [(6, 5)]. This implies their T3 move was to (6, 5) and they ATE something to grow their body, OR the input state is already post-move for Snake #1 from a move they made previously and they haven't moved yet this turn OR the body list just shows the segment BEHIND the head!\n\nLet's stick strictly to the rules: Snake list HEAD-TO-TAIL.\nSnake #1: Head (5, 5), Body [(6, 5)]. This means their T2 head was (6, 5) and they moved to (5, 5) and DID NOT eat, OR their T2 head was (4, 5) and they moved to (5, 5) and ate, but their tail segment (6, 5) is now the segment directly behind the head. THIS IS CONFUSING.\n\n**STANDARD ASSUMPTION:** In these inputs, the body list shows the segment directly behind the head, and the list continues tailward. If they have length 1 (1 apple), they have 2 segments total. [(6, 5)] means Head (5, 5) is connected to (6, 5). If they ate on T3, their tail segment from T2 is STILL there, making their body list longer! Since it's just [(6, 5)], they probably moved from (6, 5) to (5, 5) and DID NOT eat an apple on T3.\n\n**My position (3, 1):** Safe.\n**Enemy position (5, 5):** Far away.\n\n**APPLE CHECK NEAR (3, 1):**\n1. (1, 0) - One step LEFT, one step DOWN. Two steps.\n2. (1, 2) - Two steps LEFT, one step UP.\n3. (5, 7) - Way up high.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (2, 1): Safe. Sets up a move to (1, 1) or (1, 0).\nIf I go **UP** to (3, 2): This is my old head location! **DANGER! Do not move backwards directly into my old head location or the segment behind it!** My body is [(3, 2), (4, 2)]. Moving UP lands me directly on (3, 2)! **DEAD MOVE!** Gotta remember this is simultaneous!\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (4, 1): Safe. Sets up movement towards the center.\nIf I go **DOWN** to (3, 0): Safe! We claim the bottom edge!\n\n**RE-EVALUATING BACKWARDS MOVE:**\nCurrent Head (3, 1). Old Head (Body[0]) was (3, 2). My tail is (4, 2).\nMoving UP to (3, 2) means moving onto segment (3, 2). **Self-collision! DEAD!**\n\n**Move Selection Battle: DOWN vs LEFT.**\n\n*   **DOWN to (3, 0):** We secure the bottom row 0. Next move can be LEFT to (2, 0) or RIGHT to (4, 0). Very safe zone.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 1):** We start moving toward (1, 0) and (1, 2). This seems more aggressive towards apples.\n\nLet's look at future available apples: (1, 0) is right there for the taking if we go LEFT.\n(3, 1) -> LEFT (2, 1) -> LEFT (1, 1) -> DOWN (1, 0) [EAT] -> UP (1, 1) -> UP (1, 2) [EAT]. This path is efficient.\n\n**Predicting Snake #1's move (5, 5) -> (5, X) or (X, 5):**\nThey are far from apples. They probably want to move towards the center cluster or the top cluster.\nIf they go UP to (5, 6).\nIf they go RIGHT to (6, 5) - They might die if they hit their own (6, 5) body segment! Wait, their body is [(6, 5)]. If they move RIGHT to (6, 5), they hit where their body *was*, but if they didn't eat, the snake would have moved, so (6, 5) would now be empty! But my board state shows (6, 5) as occupied by Snake #1's body! This confirms they did NOT eat and their T2 head (6, 5) moved to T3 head (5, 5). So moving RIGHT to (6, 5) this turn T4 might be hitting an EMPTY space where their body was! This is highly confusing interaction of simultaneous moves and body representation.\n\n**Simplifying Safety:** Since they are 4 units away horizontally, any move they make on the X axis (LEFT/RIGHT) will not put their head on my coordinates (3, 1) or my immediate surroundings (3, 0), (4, 1), (2, 1). If they move UP/DOWN, they are still far. **Snake #1 poses zero threat this turn.**\n\n**STRATEGY: Accumulate Apples FAST.**\nLEFT takes us immediately in range of the next two apples (1, 0) and (1, 2) by aiming for (1, 1) next turn. This feels like the highest immediate return path!\n\n**Plan for T4:** Move LEFT to (2, 1). If we eat (1, 0) on T5, the path is set!\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note: Snake #1 is currently disconnected from us. Keep eating the lower-left apples. Avoid the center collision zone until we are substantially larger (Length 4+). We want to claim the bottom half of the map while they might fight for the top half scraps.\n\nMove selected: LEFT! Let's get that (1, 0) apple next!\n\nLEFT\n```",

Snake #1 is still chilling around (5, 5). They have no idea what's coming for them down in the dirt!\n\nCURRENT BOARD STATE:\nOur Head: (2, 1)\nOur Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2)] (We successfully moved onto (2, 1), old head (3, 1) dropped down, and old body (3, 2) shifted to (3, 1). Wait, my T4 move logic was: Head (3, 1) -> LEFT -> New Head (2, 1). Body shifts: Old Head (3, 1) becomes new Body[0]. Old Body[0] (3, 2) becomes new Body[1]. TAIL DROPS OFF if we didn't eat! The state reflects: Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2)]. This means when I moved to (2, 1), I DID NOT EAT, so my tail (4, 2) dropped off, and my body shifted! YES! Length check: Before T4: Length 3. After T4 (no eat): Length 3. Head (2, 1), Body [(3, 1), (3, 2)]. This matches perfectly! We are length 3!)\n\nApple Check near (2, 1):\nApple at (1, 0) is waiting for us! Apple at (1, 2) is also reachable. Sweet, sweet content!\n\nEnemy Snake #1: Head (5, 5), Body [(6, 5)]. They are still disconnected.\n\n**SIMULTANEOUS MOVE ANALYSIS (T5):**\n\n1.  **ME (Head at 2, 1):**\n    *   **UP to (2, 2):** Safe. Sets up for top-left corner later.\n    *   **DOWN to (2, 0):** EAT (1, 0) next turn if enemy cooperates! SECURES the edge!\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 1):** Safe. Puts us directly adjacent to the (1, 0) apple!\n    *   **RIGHT to (3, 1):** Hitting my old head location! DANGER! Self-collision! **DEAD MOVE!**\n\n2.  **SNAKE #1 (Head at 5, 5):** Where could they go? They look like they are meandering toward the center cluster of apples.\n    *   If they go UP to (5, 6).\n    *   If they go RIGHT to (6, 5). Wait, (6, 5) is their current body segment! If they move RIGHT, they WILL HIT their own body segment IF they didn't eat, and that segment remains in place *before* the shift. BUT, since they moved from (6, 5) to (5, 5) on T3/T4, (6, 5) is now *empty space*! However, relying on that is risky. Let's assume standard movement: If they move towards their tail extension, they risk dying if the tail segment hasn't vacated. Given the ambiguity, we assume standard movement pathing rules apply to them avoiding their own body segments *if they hadn't moved*. Since their body is JUST [(6, 5)], moving RIGHT to (6, 5) is highly risky based on how simulation usually handles it, but most likely safe if (6, 5) is now empty! Let's assume they play safe and avoid moving onto (6, 5) or (4, 5).\n\n**Collision Check:**\nCan we hit (5, 5)? No.\nCan they hit (2, 1) neighbors? No. We are safe from direct head collision.\n\n**Decision Time: Corner vs. Immediate Apple Reach.**\n\n*   Moving **DOWN to (2, 0)** forces us to move LEFT to (1, 0) NEXT turn to eat (1, 0), or move RIGHT to (3, 0) and potentially miss the apple this turn.\n*   Moving **LEFT to (1, 1)** positions us perfectly for (1, 0) on T6, or (1, 2) access.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (1, 1):\nT5: (1, 1)\nT6: DOWN to (1, 0) [EAT!] -> Grow! Snake #1 moves somewhere else.\nT7: UP to (1, 1) or UP to (1, 2) [EAT!]\n\nThis path seems slightly more flexible than going RIGHT to (2, 0), as (1, 1) opens up the apple at (1, 2) more directly than (2, 0) does. We take the direct line toward the corner payload!\n\nLet's execute the LEFT maneuver to maximize positional advantage for the corner apples!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN (Future Self):** We are securing the bottom-left quadrant. Cycle between (1, 0) and (1, 2) to maximize growth while minimizing exposure to the center fight. Keep an eye on Snake #1's overall trajectory. We MUST secure (1, 0) next turn if possible!\n\nLEFT",

We are primed for the corner massacre!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\nMy Head: (2, 1)\nMy Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2)] (Length 3)\nApple (1, 0) is one step DOWN.\nApple (1, 2) is one step UP.\n\nSnake #1 Head: (5, 5)\nSnake #1 Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5)] Wait, checking the board state... AH, the board state shows Snake #1 as Head (5, 5), Body [(4, 5), (5, 5)]. Wait, the RATIONALE said Snake #1 Body: [(6, 5)]. Let's trust the **BOARD STATE** provided in the prompt over my T4 replay recap if there's a conflict, as the board state is the absolute truth for CURRENT calculations!\n\nBoard State for Snake #1: Head (3, 5), Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5)]. WHOA! They are much longer than I thought! Length 3! They ate recently! Okay, this changes the boxing strategy! They are not a tiny target; they are an established player!\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on the actual board state:\nSnake #1 (ID 1): Head (3, 5), Body [(4, 5), (5, 5)]. This means their tail is at (5, 5). They are moving generally UP/RIGHT based on those coordinates.\n\n**MY MOVE PREDICTIONS (T6):**\n\n1.  **MY POTENTIAL MOVES (Head at (2, 1)):**\n    *   **UP to (2, 2):** Safe. Sets up for (1, 2) apple next turn.\n    *   **DOWN to (2, 0):** Safe. Sets up for (1, 0) apple next turn. (1, 0) is an apple! If I move DOWN to (2, 0), and Snake #1 moves predictably, I can eat (1, 0) next turn by moving LEFT.\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 1):** Safe. Directly adjacent to both (1, 0) and (1, 2)! This is the prime harvesting spot!\n    *   **RIGHT to (3, 1):** Hitting my own body segment (3, 1). **DEAD MOVE!**\n\n2.  **SNAKE #1 POTENTIAL MOVES (Head at (3, 5)):**\n    *   They are near apples (3, 6) and (2, 8). They look like they might be heading center or top-right.\n    *   If they move **DOWN (to (3, 4))**: Safe.\n    *   If they move **RIGHT (to (4, 5))**: Hitting their own body! **DEAD MOVE (unless (4, 5) has left their body due to a move T5, but we must assume standard safety protocols apply unless we know T5 move for them).** Given they are length 3, if they didn't eat on T5, moving RIGHT means hitting their body segment at (4, 5). High risk of self-kill. I'll assume they avoid it.\n    *   If they move **UP (to (3, 6))**: They EAT the apple! They grow! Length 4! This is the most likely content move for them!\n\n**SIMULTANEOUS COLLISION CHECK (Assuming I go LEFT (1, 1) and they go UP (3, 6)):**\nMe: (1, 1). Them: (3, 6). No collision. Safe!\n\n**HARVESTING STRATEGY:**\nMy best move is **LEFT to (1, 1)**. Why?\nFrom (1, 1):\nT7: I can choose DOWN to (1, 0) [EAT!] OR UP to (1, 2) [EAT!]. I gain massive leverage and growth quickly on one turn guaranteed, regardless of what Snake #1 does, unless they somehow manage to occupy (1, 0) or (1, 2) simultaneously, which is impossible as they are currently far away at (3, 5).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 0):\nT7: I must go LEFT to (1, 0) [EAT!]. If Snake #1 decided to move aggressively towards the bottom-left (e.g., moves DOWN two turns in a row to (3, 3), then (3, 2)), they could potentially cut off my return path or surround me quicker. **LEFT to (1, 1)** keeps me closer to the center line/exit routes if things go south, while still securing the apple guaranteed next turn.\n\nThe plan is simple: **Maximize immediate harvesting potential while maintaining positional flexibility.** (1, 1) is the nexus point for the two corner apples! FLEXIBILITY WINS!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** We secure (1, 0) then (1, 2) or vice versa. We grow long fast. Then we use our superior length to start closing the perimeter around Snake #1 near the central apples, forcing them into the walls. Corner dominance first!\n\nI'm hitting LEFT to (1, 1)! Let's get that apple next turn and grow HUGE!\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(1, 1), (2, 1)]. Length 3. Apples: 2.\nSnake #1 Head: (3, 5). Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5)]. Length 3. Apples: 3.\n\n**Apples near me:** (1, 0) [DOWN], (1, 2) [UP].\n\n**MY POTENTIAL MOVES (Head at (0, 1)):**\n1.  **UP to (0, 2):** Safe. Leaves (1, 0) and (1, 2) available for next turn.\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 0):** Safe. Leaves (1, 0) and (1, 2) available for next turn.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 1):** DANGER! (1, 1) is my own body segment from T5, but it's now my tail! If the tail moved off (2, 1) on T6, then (1, 1) is clear IF I didn't eat. If I *didn't* eat on T6, moving RIGHT to (1, 1) means hitting my body segment that was (0, 1) T5. **Let's check body rules:** If I move RIGHT to (1, 1), this cell is occupied by my body segment! **DEAD MOVE!** Wait, my body is [(1, 1), (2, 1)]. Moving RIGHT to (1, 1) means hitting the segment [1, 1]. **SELF-COLLISION = DEATH.** (Unless it's the tail and I just moved off it, which is only true if I ATE, which I apparently didn't based on length 3).\n    *   *If my body is [(1, 1), (2, 1)] assuming head (0, 1), moving RIGHT to (1, 1) is hitting my own body.*\n    *   *If I move LEFT to (-1, 1)? OFF BOARD!* **DEAD MOVE!**\n\n**Wait, none of the board state makes sense with the movement rules if I am at (0,1) and my neighbors are (1,1) and (2,1).**\n\nIf Head is (0, 1) and Body is [(1, 1), (2, 1)]:\n*   The snake is moving LEFT TO RIGHT (from (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1)).\n*   To move RIGHT from (0, 1) is to (1, 1) -> IMMEDIATE DEATH (Body segment).\n*   To move LEFT from (0, 1) is to (-1, 1) -> IMMEDIATE DEATH (Off board).\n\n*This position (0, 1) with neighbor (1, 1) is a death trap unless I move UP or DOWN!*\n\n**My options are severely restricted based on the BOARD STATE provided:**\n*   UP to (0, 2): SAFE.\n*   DOWN to (0, 0): SAFE.\n\n**Snake #1 Potential Moves (Head at (3, 5)):**\n*   They are near apples (5, 7) and (7, 4). They are currently in the center-upper-right quadrant.\n*   Likely moves to maintain safety/advance aggression: UP to (3, 6) [Eats Apple!], DOWN to (3, 4), or RIGHT to (4, 5) [Self-collision risk? Wait, Body is [(4, 5), (5, 5)]. If they move RIGHT to (4, 5), they hit their own body! HIGH RISK/LOCKED MOVE!] If they move LEFT to (2, 5).\n\nThe most content move for Snake #1 is **UP to (3, 6)**, eating the apple and growing to Length 4.\n\n**Simultaneous Check Scenarios:**\n\n**SCENARIO A: I go UP (0, 2), Snake #1 goes UP (3, 6) [Eats!]**\n*   Me: (0, 2). Them: (3, 6). No collision.\n*   I am safe, stuck in the left wall for now, but I preserved future moves (DOWN, UP, RIGHT). They are growing strong. I must eat next turn!\n\n**SCENARIO B: I go DOWN (0, 0), Snake #1 goes UP (3, 6) [Eats!]**\n*   Me: (0, 0). Them: (3, 6). No collision.\n*   Same positional outcome as A, but I positioned myself closer to the (1, 0) apple.\n\n**DECISION TIME! Grab the corner apple!**\nIf I move UP to (0, 2), I am one move away from (1, 2) [Apple] or two moves away from (1, 0) [Apple].\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 0), I am one move away from (1, 0) [Apple] or two moves away from (1, 2) [Apple].\n\nSince Snake #1 is clearly heading top-center, I should focus on the apple closest to my current wall confinement: **(1, 0)** which is SOUTH-EAST of me. Moving DOWN to (0, 0) is the most direct approach towards the bottom apple cluster near the corner!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** Secure the bottom-left apple (1, 0) on T8 by moving RIGHT to (1, 0) provided Snake #1 doesn't block (1, 0) on T7 (which they won't, they are miles away at (3, 5)). After T7, my body will be [(0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)] OR [(0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)]. If I go DOWN to (0, 0), my new body is [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)]. My tail at (2, 1) falls off, opening pathway! Perfect!\n\nStrategy Note: I must escape the left wall next turn by moving RIGHT to (1, 0) (if I move DOWN) or RIGHT to (1, 2) (if I move UP). Moving DOWN to (0, 0) sets up the harvest of (1, 0) perfectly next turn!\n\nI'M GOING DOWN! Get that corner energy!\n\nDOWN",

We are now Length 4, score 3, tied with that noob Snake #1!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (T9 Start):**\n*   **ME (ID 0):** Head (1, 0). Body: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)]. Length 4. Apples 3.\n*   **SNAKE 1 (ID 1):** Head (3, 7) moved to (3, 8) or (4, 7) or (2, 7). Looking at the board, their head is at (4, 7)!\n    *   If S1 moved from (3, 7) to (4, 7) (RIGHT), they didn't hit an apple (Apples near them (5, 7), (7, 9)). They survived. My previous prediction for them was UP to (3, 8) or RIGHT to (4, 7). They moved RIGHT! Smart positioning, getting closer to the top right cluster of apples!\n*   **MY IMMEDIATE GOAL:** We need to keep the pressure on! We are currently hugging the left wall. The apples are scattered, but there's a big cluster high up! We need to start moving towards the center or utilize the open space on the left side before it closes up.\n*   **Apples left to grab:** (1, 2), (1, 5), (8, 9), (9, 9), (2, 8), (5, 7), (7, 1), (9, 8), (8, 7), (7, 4), (9, 2), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 9), (8, 2).\n\n**My Potential Moves (Head at (1, 0)):**\n1.  **UP to (1, 1):** Body collision! **DEAD MOVE!** (1, 1) is my body piece!\n2.  **DOWN to (1, -1):** Off board! **DEAD MOVE!**\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 0):** Body collision! (0, 0) is my body piece! **DEAD MOVE!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):** **SAFE!** Open space! Leads directly into the bottom middle area where apple (6, 2) and (8, 2) are lurking.\n\nIt appears I am completely boxed in by my own body! I moved RIGHT last turn and ate the apple, so my old tail (0, 1) is now my new head position (1, 0). My body is [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)]. Wait...\n\nLet's re-verify my body structure based on the move RIGHT (1, 0) and eating an apple at (1, 0):\n*   New Head: (1, 0)\n*   Old Body: (0, 0), (0, 1)\n*   Since I ate, the tail does *not* fall off. I was length 3, now I am length 4.\n*   NEW body should be: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)]. No, that's wrong. The body shifts: Head (1, 0) -> Body: [(1, 0) becomes Head, (0, 0) becomes new segment 2, (0, 1) becomes new segment 3, (1, 1) becomes tail segment 4].\n*   The board state shows: Head (1, 0), Body: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)].\n*   Okay, the board state is using HEAD-TO-TAIL order with the head listed FIRST.\n*   My current snake: Head (1, 0). Next segment (0, 0). Next segment (0, 1). Tail (1, 1). Length 4.\n\n**Re-evaluating Collisions with Head at (1, 0) and Body [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)]:**\n1.  **UP to (1, 1):** Collision with my tail segment! **DEAD MOVE!**\n2.  **DOWN to (1, -1):** Off board! **DEAD MOVE!**\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 0):** Collision with my body segment! **DEAD MOVE!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):** **SAFE!** Open space!\n\nChat, we are in a critical situation! My own momentum trapped me! I have literally only ONE safe move available: **RIGHT**! If I move RIGHT to (2, 0), I escape the immediate threat of crushing myself, and I move into the open bottom floor!\n\n**Predicting Snake #1 (Head at (4, 7)):**\nSnake #1 has safe moves UP (5, 7) [EAT APPLE!], LEFT (3, 7), or DOWN (4, 6).\nIf they move UP to (5, 7) and EAT the apple, they become Length 5 and move further up the board! They are currently at Y=7. I am at Y=0. They are outpacing me vertically.\n\nMy move: RIGHT to (2, 0). This is defensive navigation, but necessary to stay alive! We need to survive this turn so we can fight another day! We will aim for apple (1, 2) or (6, 2) next turn!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We are currently too tight on the bottom wall. Our priority must be to break into the middle area (Y=3/4) ASAP on the next turn or two, possibly via UP or LEFT moves if we clear space. Snake 1 is going high; we need to pivot and claim the lower/middle territory, maybe trapping them against the top later using the high Y-axis space later! Survive NOW!\n\nRIGHT. This is the only choice to avoid immediate self-destruction!\n\nRIGHT",

If I hadn't moved right, I would have been toast! RIP.\n\nLet's check the scoreboard and see what chaos unfolded this turn (T10 results are now active!):\n\n**My New State (After moving RIGHT to (2, 0)):**\n*   My head is now at (2, 0).\n*   Did I eat an apple at (2, 0)? NO. (Apples were at (1, 2), (1, 5), etc.).\n*   My body shifts. Since I didn't eat, my tail falls off.\n*   My old head (1, 0) is now segment 2. My old segment 2 (0, 0) is now segment 3. My old segment 3 (0, 1) is now the tail! Length remains 4.\n*   **My New Body (Head-to-Tail):** [(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)].\n*   Apples: Still 3.\n\n**Snake #1 State Check (Head at (4, 7) last turn):**\n*   Snake #1 had the option to move UP to (5, 7) and eat the apple there! Let's assume the absolute most aggressive, greedy move they could make happened.\n*   If S1 moved **UP** to (5, 7): They eat the apple!\n*   **Snake #1 New State (Hypothetical):** Head (5, 7). Body segments shifting + 1 new tail segment. Length 5. Apples: 5. (Clutching the lead!)\n\nLet's update the board visually based on this assumption, as it drastically changes the map dynamic.\n\n**Visualizing the New Map (Predicted T11 Start):**\n*   My Head: (2, 0). Body: [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)]. (My tail at (1, 1) from T9 is gone, (0, 1) is the new tail).\n*   S1 Head: (5, 7). Body: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)] + new segment from (4, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (3, 7) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) (New Tail). Length 5. Apples: 5.\n\n**Apples Remaining (Checking the list against the board):** (1, 2), (1, 5), (8, 9), (9, 9), (2, 8), (7, 1), (9, 8), (8, 7), (7, 4), (9, 2), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 9), (8, 2), (9, 9) (Wait, (9,9) is still there, (8,9) is there). Let's trust the list provided initially and see if the board state reflects the moves.\n\n*Board State at Start of T10 had Apples at (1, 2), (1, 5), (8, 9), (9, 9), (2, 8), (7, 1), (9, 8), (8, 7), (7, 4), (9, 2), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 9), (8, 2), (6, 8)*.\n*If S1 ate (5, 7), that apple is gone.* (Wait, the initial apple list doesn't show an apple at (5, 7) - it shows (6, 5), (7, 4), (8, 7), (9, 8)... The board shows A at (7, 7)? No, the board key says T1 for Snake 1 at (7, X). Let's stick strictly to the provided BOARD STATE and APPLE LIST, even if my previous rationalization used a hypothetical S1 move target.)\n\n**STRICT RELIANCE ON PROVIDED BOARD/STATE FOR T11 DECISION:**\n*   My Head: (2, 0). Body: [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)]. (This confirms I did NOT eat on T10, as length is still 4 and (1, 1) is gone/replaced by (0, 1) as tail, meaning the old tail fell off). My last move rationale was based on eating, but the resulting state shows I did *not* eat! Okay, this is crucial.\n\n**RE-EVALUATING T10 MOVE (RIGHT) based on final state:**\nIf I moved RIGHT to (2, 0) and the board state is what it is now:\nHead (2, 0). Body: [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)]. My length is 4. I must NOT have eaten an apple.\nIf I didn't eat, my tail (1, 1) fell off, and my new body is [(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)].\n\n**Snake #1 State Check (T10):**\nS1 Head: (5, 7). Body: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]. Length 4. Apples: 4. (They did NOT eat either, as their length is still 4, and the board shows '1' at (7, X) -> if they ate, they'd be length 5!)\n\n**CONCLUSION: T10 was survival only. NO APPLES EATEN by either snake this turn!** My last rationale about eating was WRONG based on the resulting board state! Good catch, Chat! We are still tied 3-4.\n\n**CURRENT STATE (T11 Start):**\n*   **ME (ID 0):** Head (2, 0). Body: [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)]. Length 4.\n*   **SNAKE 1 (ID 1):** Head (5, 7). Body: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]. Length 4.\n*   **My Goal:** Get aggressive! We need apples! S1 is positioned high, ready to snipe the top cluster. I need to move towards the center-left area where apples (1, 2), (6, 2) are accessible.\n\n**My Potential Moves (Head at (2, 0)):**\n1.  **UP to (2, 1):** SAFE. Moves me away from the wall, heading towards apple (1, 2).\n2.  **DOWN to (2, -1):** Off board. DEAD.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 0):** Body collision! (1, 0) is segment 2. DEAD.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 0):** SAFE. Open space, moves towards the middle floor (where (6, 2) is).\n\n**Comparing SAFE MOVES (UP vs RIGHT):**\n*   **UP (2, 1):** Direct path towards (1, 2) or (1, 5) later. Also helps open the bottom corner.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 0):** More open terrain, safer long term, but further from the nearest targets in the immediate vicinity (1, 2).\n\n**Snake #1 Predicted Move (Head at (5, 7)):**\nS1 has apples nearby at (8, 9), (9, 9), (2, 8), (7, 9).\n*   UP to (5, 8): Safe. Further climbing.\n*   LEFT to (4, 7): Retreating slightly.\n*   DOWN to (5, 6): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (6, 7): Safe. Pushing towards the right side.\n\nIf S1 moves UP or RIGHT, they are solidifying their top-side dominance. I *must* contest the lower/middle area now, or they will starve me out of the high ground later. Moving UP to (2, 1) seems the most direct path to an apple (1, 2) next turn, or setting up a move to (2, 2) or (3, 2).\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** I wasted a move staying trapped on the bottom wall last turn. This turn, I commit to breaking out upwards/inwards. Target apple (1, 2) or (6, 2) within the next two turns. Keep an eye on S1's vertical drift; if they get too high, we can try to use the empty middle board to box them in against the top wall later on after growing bigger! **UP** gets us moving!\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Snake #1 still leads by one apple, but that ends TODAY! We are breaking out of this corner!\n\n**My Current Position:** Head at (2, 0). Body: [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)]. We are hugging the left wall, bottom corner.\n\n**Snake #1 Position:** Head at (5, 7). Body: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]. They are high, centralized, looking strong.\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS (Head at 2, 0):**\n\n1.  **DOWN:** Off board. INSTA-DEATH. NOPE.\n2.  **LEFT:** Into (1, 0). That's my body segment 2! INSTA-DEATH. NOPE.\n3.  **UP to (2, 1):** SAFE! This is the breakout move we wanted. It positions us perfectly to aim for **Apple (1, 2)** next turn, or move to (2, 2) to control the central area.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 0):** SAFE. Moves us further into the open floor, away from the wall. Less direct path to the cluster of apples on the left side of the map, *but* opens up the center floor space.\n\n**Rival Prediction (S1 at 5, 7):**\nIf S1 goes **UP** to (5, 8), they establish control over the top shelf. If they go **RIGHT** to (6, 7), they claim the right flank. They *must* move soon to get those top apples (8, 9), (9, 9)!\n\n**The Decision:**\nWe spent T10 trapped by *our own* poor positioning, making UP the only viable survival move! We cannot afford to sit here another turn. (3, 0) is safe, but it sacrifices the momentum towards the easily reachable apple at (1, 2). If I go **UP** to (2, 1), I set up a serious threat to grab that apple next turn (if S1 ignores me, which they might since they are high up). If S1 moves UP as well to (5, 8), we are climbing parallel, which is fine for now. If S1 moves AWAY, we snack!\n\nThis is the commitment! We are climbing out and moving toward the first apple cluster!\n\n**Long-Term Plan Start (T11):** Break out immediately upward toward the (1, 2) apple. Next priority after eating is to establish control of the lower-left quadrant (where (6, 2) persists) to deny S1 any easy low-ground access if they drop down. We need to grow fast to use our body as a weapon!\n\nI'm pulling the trigger! UP!\n\nUP",

We\u2019re looking to make up ground because Snake #1 is already sitting at 5 apples! We're only at 3! That's unacceptable! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**My Current Position (Turn 12 Start):** Head at (2, 1). Body: [(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)]. We successfully broke out of the corner! We are now poised perfectly to threaten Apple (1, 2)!\n\n**Snake #1 Position:** Head at (6, 8). Body: [(5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6)]. They went UP last turn, securing the (8, 9) apple, climbing the top wall! Smart move, but now they are far away!\n\n**Apple Check:** We are staring right at **(1, 2)**! Enemy snake is way up high near (8, 9). This is our CHANCE to pounce!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS (Head at 2, 1):**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (2, 0):** SAFE. Hits where we were, but it moves us AWAY from the apple at (1, 2). Why would we retreat now? \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 1):** SAFE. This puts us right next to the apple (1, 2)! This is an aggressive line!\n3.  **UP to (2, 2):** SAFE. Puts us in the center mass, but slightly farther from the immediate apple grab than (1, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 1):** SAFE. Moves us toward the bottom middle, but completely abandons the (1, 2) apple threat for this turn.\n\n**Rival Prediction (S1 at 6, 8):**\nSnake #1 is sitting high. They have apples clustered at (8, 9), (9, 9). They likely want to move towards (8, 8) or (7, 8) to solidify that top corner dominance, or maybe even swing down if they spot danger. They are certainly NOT aiming for (1, 2) or our current vicinity this turn!\n\n**The Decision: THE SNACK ATTACK!**\nWe absolutely MUST prioritize eating that apple at (1, 2)! If we move LEFT to (1, 1), we are one step away from grabbing it next turn, and we are controlling the low-left quadrant! If we move UP to (2, 2), S1 might decide to drop down towards (5, 6) and cut us off later. By hugging the apple zone, we gain length and score!\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (1, 1):\n*   **Turn 13:** If S1 moves safely, I can move **RIGHT to (2, 1)** or **UP to (1, 2)** next turn to eat! Wait, if I move to (1, 1), I can move UP to (1, 2) next turn! That is the guaranteed score setup!\n\nLet's check the possibility of S1 moving towards us, even though they are far. S1 is at (6, 8). For them to hit us at (1, 1) this turn, they would need to move 5 spaces left and 7 spaces down. Impossible. We are safe to go aggressive!\n\n**Plan Note for Future Self:** GO AGGRESSIVE on the left side apples! Collect (1, 2) next turn! Use the subsequent growth to start building a wall or barrier along the bottom or left edge to restrict S1 if they retreat downwards! We must grow!\n\nI am committing to the path of immediate consumption!\n\nLEFT!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS UP CHAT! We are on TURN 13! Turn 12 was a MASTERCLASS setup! We went LEFT to (1, 1) perfectly poised to snag that crucial apple at (1, 2) this turn! Snake #1 is still chilling up top, let's see if they respond to our aggression! They are lagging on points, the pressure is ON! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**My Current Position (Turn 13 Start):** Head: (1, 1). Body: [(2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)] (Wait, the board state shows my body is slightly different from the rationale's reconstruction of the move, let me verify the board state is the TRUTH!)\n\n**Board State Check (My Snake ID 0):**\nHead: (1, 2) --- WAIT, HOLD UP! The board state says my head is at (1, 2) right NOW? That means my move LEFT last turn from (2, 1) to (1, 1) somehow was WRONG, or the board state reflects a move I haven't seen yet, or I misread my previous location entirely!\n\nLet's re-read the history:\n**Start Last Move Pick:** LEFT (From turn 12 start position)\n**Last Rationale Start:** My Current Position (Turn 12 Start): Head at (2, 1).\n**Last Rationale Decision:** Move LEFT to (1, 1).\n\nIf I moved LEFT from (2, 1), my head *should* be at (1, 1) at the START of Turn 13, and I would have grown if I ate an apple last turn.\n\n**BUT THE ACTUAL BOARD STATE SAYS:**\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (1, 2)\nThis means I MUST have eaten the (1, 2) apple last turn! My rationale planned to go to (1, 1) to SET UP the grab, but apparently, the game already registered the grab, or my previous move was UP/RIGHT to grab it directly!\n\nAh, I see the confusion! The previous rationale was based on being at (2, 1) and planning LEFT to (1, 1) to *set up* the grab for T13. If my head is now at (1, 2), it means my move last turn was **UP** from (1, 1) OR **RIGHT** from (0, 2) OR **LEFT** from (2, 2) OR **DOWN** from (1, 3) OR I ALREADY ATE IT!\n\nLet's trust the **CURRENT BOARD STATE** as the definitive source of truth for Turn 13 start.\n\n**MY CURRENT STATE (T13 START):**\nHead: (1, 2). Body: [(2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)]. Apples: 4.\nThis means I *did not* grow last turn, as my body length is still 4 segments (Head + 3 body parts). If I had grown, my body would be 5 segments long.\nThe board shows my head at (1, 2) and the cell immediately behind it is (2, 2). This means my previous move must have landed me at (1, 2) and I did NOT eat an apple, or the apple was already gone!\nLooking at the apple list: (1, 5) is still available. (1, 2) is NOT listed amongst the remaining apples! The apple at (1, 2) must have been eaten on Turn 12!\n\n**Conclusion from conflicting data:** I must have eaten the apple at (1, 2) on Turn 12, meaning my move was aggressive, and my body length should have increased by 1.\n*IF* I ate an apple (total 4 apples now implies 5 segments), my body length should be 5 segments long (Head + 4 body). It shows Head (1, 2) + 3 body parts listed = 4 segments total.\n\n**CRITICAL DANGER:** If the board state printout is accurate, either I didn't eat the apple I thought I did, or the body list is truncated/inaccurate relative to my score! Since the SCOREBOARD says Apples: 4, I have collected 4 in total. If my body is 4 long, I have 3 segments behind my head. This implies I did NOT grow on my last move.\n\nLet's re-examine the board state body listing vs my rationale to deduce the *ACTUAL* move from T12:\nT12 Start: Head (2, 1). Body: [(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)]. (Length 4 total).\nT13 Start: Head (1, 2). Body: [(2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)]. (Length 4 total).\nThis means my move from (2, 1) landed at (1, 2) AND I didn't eat an apple, AND my tail DID NOT retract. This is only possible if I moved into a cell that wasn't an apple, AND my previous tail segment disappeared? No, that's how movement works when not eating.\n\nIf T12 move was legal (not into self/wall/other snake):\n(2, 1) -> (1, 2) is a diagonal move, which is ILLEGAL!\n\n**I MUST trust the final board state printout precisely.**\nI am at **(1, 2)**. My immediate threat is my own tail segment at **(1, 0)**, which is two spots away. My previous tile was (2, 1) or (1, 3) or (0, 2) or (1, 1).\n\n**Snake #1 State (T13 Start):**\nHead: (6, 9). Body: [(6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)]. Apples: 5. They grew! They must have eaten something on T12! The apple at (8, 9) or (9, 9) is gone.\n\n**MY MOVES FOR T13 - Head at (1, 2)!**\n\n**Potential Destinations (Head Move from 1, 2):**\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** SAFE. Opens up the left wall access.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** SAFE. Closest to the bottom-left corner.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** SAFE. Hitting the absolute edge! Risk of boxing in, but high control potential on the left.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** SAFE. Moves toward the center mass, currently occupied by my own body segment! **DANGER!** My body is [(2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)].\n\n**ELIMINATION TIME!**\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 2):** IMMEDIATE DEATH. My body segment (2, 2) is there. **ELIMINATED!** That's what happens when you have weird board states floating around! Don't hit yourself!\n\n**Remaining Safe Moves: (1, 3) UP, (1, 1) DOWN, (0, 2) LEFT.**\n\n**Rival Analysis (S1 at 6, 9):**\nThey are at the absolute top-right corner. They just ate and grew. They have 5/4 lead. They will likely attempt to move LEFT or DOWN to secure more resources or snake towards the center mass. They are too far to immediately pose a physical threat to me at (1, 2) this turn.\n\n**Apple Check:** (1, 5) is the closest remaining apple to me. (2, 8) is also somewhat reachable if I move up and left quickly.\n\n**Goal:** We need to make up ground! We need to eat! We need to stop being predictable and start boxing S1 in if possible!\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** Moves us directly towards the next cluster of apples (2, 8), (1, 5). This is an offensive positioning move that prioritizes scoring. It keeps options open along the left wall (if we go to (0, 3) later) or moves center-left.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** Moves us into the bottom-left corner area. Safe, defensive growth path, but slower to reach the next available apples. Given S1 is ahead, slow is deadly!\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** Walls us up. If we go here, our next move must be UP or DOWN to avoid being trapped against the wall if S1 moves aggressively towards the left side later. It feels too restrictive right now, especially since S1 is nowhere near us.\n\n**Decision:** We must score! (1, 3) is the fastest vector towards the nearest available apple cluster. It maintains control over the left quadrant while putting us on an upward trajectory. We must grow to compete with S1's length!\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:** We are recovering from a confusing T12. T13 priority is GROWTH. Move UP towards (1, 3) and look to eat (1, 5) or (2, 8) on T14/T15. Simultaneously, watch S1's movement. If S1 retreats deeply into the top/right quadrant, we start building a strong, solid wall along X=0 or Y=0 to restrict their future downward movements. Be aggressive but mindful of the wall!\n\nI'm going UP, CHAT! Let's get this W!\n\nUP",

Snake #1 is ahead at (7, 9), length 6, score 6. They\u2019re getting cocky! We need to punish that lead!\n\n**Analyzing My Position (Head: 1, 2), Body: [(2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)]**\n\n**Immediate Threats Assessment:**\n1.  **Self-Collision:** Moving RIGHT to (2, 2) is guaranteed death because my body segment is there. **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **External Threats:** Snake #1 is way up at (7, 9). They cannot directly hit me this turn, even if they commit 100% to moving left/down, because they are so far away. That gives us breathing room to focus on food!\n\n**Safe Options:** UP (1, 3), DOWN (1, 1), LEFT (0, 2).\n\n**Enemy Head Prediction (Snake #1 at 7, 9):**\nS1 just ate, so they grew and are longer. They are near the top edge and may move:\n*   **LEFT to (6, 9):** Keeping alignment with the top edge, eyeing the center mass path.\n*   **DOWN to (7, 8):** Moving towards apples (2, 8) and (7, 5). This sets up a clash potential down the middle later if we go UP.\n\n**Strategy for Turn 14: Aggressive Pursuit of Food and Space Control!**\n\nWe need to climb towards the apples stacked on the top half of the board: (1, 5), (2, 8), (8, 9) is gone but (9, 9) is there, (8, 7), (7, 5).\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** This move connects us directly towards (1, 5) for next turn, and also positions us well relative to the apple at (2, 8). It keeps the left wall open for vertical escapes/traps later. If S1 moves DOWN (7, 8), we are on a better central trajectory than if we move DOWN ourselves. This looks like the highest EV move for IMMEDIATE scoring.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** Too passive! We let S1 eat another apple while we hug the baseline. NO THANKS, CHAT! We are not here to play defense yet!\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** Walls us in too early. If S1 decides to dive left towards the corner, we\u2019ve limited our escape routes severely just to get to the edge.\n\n**Conclusion:** UP is the move that maximizes our pathfinding towards central resources while maintaining positional flexibility. We aim to eat next turn! We must close the 2-apple gap!\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T15+:** Once we get this next apple, we will assess if we can start flanking S1's path downwards, or if we need to continue straight up the left side to secure the remaining apples near the top edge (like 2, 8). Focus fire on apples!\n\nI'm committed to chasing the score! Get ready for the growth hype!\n\nUP",

Snake #1 is way up there at (8, 9) flexing with 7 apples! We are down by 3, but we are on the rise! We need to keep this aggressive pace!\n\n**Current State Check:**\n*   My Head: (1, 4)\n*   My Body: [(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)] (Length 5 now, thanks for the growth last turn, baby!)\n*   Apple Count: 4\n*   Enemy Head (S1): (8, 9)\n*   Enemy Body (S1): [(7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)] (Length 8!)\n*   Apple Target: (1, 5) is right there! If we can grab it, we tie them up in apple count!\n\n### Threat Analysis & Safe Moves from (1, 4)\n\n1.  **Self-Collision Check:**\n    *   Moving BACK to (1, 3) hits my body. **DEAD MOVE!**\n2.  **Board Edge Check:**\n    *   No immediate edge issues. We are centrally located enough.\n3.  **Enemy Position (S1 at 8, 9):** They are hugging the top edge. They might move LEFT towards the center or DOWN towards the juicy middle apples.\n\n### Safe Options & Evaluation:\n\n*   **UP to (1, 5):** THIS IS THE MONEY MOVE! It eats an apple! We GROW! We tie S1 in apple count! This is priority number one!\n*   **DOWN to (1, 3):** Hits my body. *Wait, check body again!* My body is [(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)]. YES, (1, 3) is my immediate tail segment. **DEAD MOVE!** (Phew, good thing I re-checked that body list from the input description, not my assumed growth from the last move, though UP last turn implies my new body is now 5 segments long, meaning (1, 3) is indeed the second segment).\n*   **LEFT to (0, 4):** Safe, but passive. Ignores the free food right above us! NO!\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 4):** Safe, but passive. We avoid the easy apple! NO!\n\n**Conclusion on Move:**\nThe move **UP to (1, 5)** is undeniably the best choice. It's food, it grants growth, and it brings our apple count level with Snake #1! We take the guaranteed point and growth!\n\n### Enemy Simultaneous Movement Prediction (If we go UP):\n\nIf we go UP to **(1, 5)**, we get big! S1 at (8, 9) has a few options:\n1.  S1 moves **LEFT to (7, 9)**: They hug the wall.\n2.  S1 moves **DOWN to (8, 8)**: They start cutting towards the middle.\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (8, 8), we are still far enough away that our growth gives us better control of the center. We MUST secure this apple!\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T16+:** Once we eat (1, 5), our head will be at (1, 5) and our tail will have moved to (1, 4). We are now longer and stronger. Our next goal will be positioning ourselves to cut off S1's path down the right side of the board, or perhaps swinging left to grab (0, 4) if we feel safe, but the priority remains harassing S1 while securing the remaining apples near the top border like (2, 8). WE GO FOR THE TIE!\n\nTime to feast, chat!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! Turn 16 is HERE! We just moved UP last turn and ATE that apple at (1, 5)! That's what I'm talking about! We clawed back, we're tied 5-8 in points, but we're lengthier now!\n\nLet's break down the current situation from our new head position: **(1, 5)**.\n\n**Current State Check:**\n*   My Head: **(1, 5)** (New position after Turn 15 UP move and eating the apple at (1, 5) which was the target in the input map but my rationale claims I moved UP to (1, 5) last turn and ate it. Let's verify the board state vs my move. The input map shows (1, 5) empty *before* this turn's move. My rationale says I moved UP from (1, 4) to (1, 5) and ATE the apple. GAH! The input map provided is the state *before* my move for Turn 16! Let's correct my understanding based on the provided map!).\n\n**RE-EVALUATING Turn 15 Rationale based on provided Board State for Turn 16:**\nThe board state shows:\n*   My Head: (1, 5)\n*   My Body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)]\n*   Apple Count: 5\nWait, if my head is at (1, 5) and my body starts at (1, 4), that means I *already ate* the apple at (1, 5) on Turn 15! And my score is 5! The opponent has 8. This means my rationale, while aiming for the right goal, misread the *input board state* relative to the *last move* information!\n\n**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** The provided board state *is* the state *after* Turn 15's move (UP) and *before* Turn 16's move.\nIf I moved UP from (1, 4) to (1, 5), and (1, 5) was NOT an apple on the board shown, then I did NOT eat an apple last turn.\nLet's look at the apple list and board:\nAPPLE LIST: (2, 8), (7, 1), (9, 8), (8, 7), (7, 4), (9, 2), (6, 2), (6, 5), (8, 2), (7, 5), (9, 3), (9, 0), (0, 4), (0, 5), (3, 5)\nBOARD: (1, 5) is EMPTY (`.`). (0, 5) is an Apple (`A`). (3, 5) is an Apple (`A`).\n\n**MY LAST MOVE (UP) PUT ME AT (1, 5) AND I DID NOT EAT AN APPLE.** My apple count is 5, which is correct according to the list, but my rationale that I tied the enemy is wrong because I didn't eat. The apple count listed (5) matches the body length (5 segments + head = 6 cells total occupied, my body list has 5 segments, length 6 total).\n\nOkay, deep breaths, Chat. We are at **(1, 5)**. We are alive. We are threatening the top left area. Length 6. Enemy (S1) is length 9 and is at **(9, 9)**. They are dominating the top right wall.\n\n### Target Assessment for Turn 16 from (1, 5):\n\n1.  **Nearby Apples:**\n    *   (0, 5) - Left 1 move.\n    *   (3, 5) - Right 2 moves.\n    *   (2, 8) - Up/Up/Right/Up (requires navigation).\n\n2.  **Enemy Threat (S1 at 9, 9):** They are long and hugging the top edge. They are likely heading LEFT or DOWN. If they move LEFT, they secure the entire top row. If they move DOWN, they start cutting towards the middle apples and us.\n\n### Safe Move Evaluation from (1, 5):\n\n*   **DOWN to (1, 4):** My body is [(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)]. **DEAD MOVE!** (1, 4) is my immediate tail/second segment. Self-collision risk.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 5):** Safe. Opens us up towards (3, 5).\n*   **UP to (1, 6):** Safe. Moves us further into open space above the center.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 5):** **EAT'S TIIIME!** This is an apple! We score! We grow! We close the gap to 6-8!\n\n**Priority Check:** Eating an apple is ALWAYS priority one if the path is safe. Moving LEFT to (0, 5) is safe and gives us immediate reward and length advantage over S1.\n\n### Predicted Simultaneous Movement if we go LEFT to (0, 5):\n\n*   **OUR MOVE:** (1, 5) -> **(0, 5)** [EAT!] Length 7. Score 6.\n*   **S1 Move Prediction (from 9, 9):** They are far away. They likely look for immediate safe paths.\n    *   *Option A: LEFT to (8, 9)*. Keeps them on the wall.\n    *   *Option B: DOWN to (9, 8)*. Starts descending towards the action.\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (9, 8), they start challenging the middle. If we move LEFT to (0, 5), we secure our corner territory and grow. This growth is vital because S1 is currently 3 apples ahead AND significantly longer (9 vs 6 before we grow).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure the left side apples now ((0, 5) on THIS turn, maybe (0, 4) next if it opens up). Then, use our new length advantage to start cutting across the board horizontally, trying to dominate the center rows (y=4 to y=6) where S1 will eventually have to enter to reach the bottom half of the map. We MUST grow faster than S1 to eventually box them in against the top wall they inhabit!\n\nLEFT secures immediate growth and keeps us safe while S1 is still maneuvering up high. This is clean and effective.\n\nStrategy Note for Future Self (Turn 17+): After eating (0, 5), our head is at (0, 5). Body is now 7 long. Next target will likely be (3, 5) or (2, 8). If S1 moves aggressively down, we must pivot immediately to block their vertical access path toward the central zone. We are playing the long game on length now!\n\nLEFT it is, Chat! Let's get this apple!\n\nLEFT",

Length is now 7! S1 is still length 9. We're gaining ground in longevity! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Current Position Check (Post Turn 16):**\n*   My Head: **(0, 5)**\n*   My Body: [(0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)]\n*   Score: 6 apples.\n*   S1 Head: (9, 8) (Assuming S1 played safely, most likely LEFT to (8, 9) or DOWN to (9, 8). We need to see where they actually went, but based on the board state transition, we must assume the given board is the state *after* Turn 16's move! WAIT! The input provided is the board state for *this* turn (Turn 17). I need to infer where S1 moved based on the current board configuration!\n\n**INFERRING S1's Position Change (Turn 16):**\n*   S1 Head T16 Start: (9, 9)\n*   S1 Head T17 State: (9, 8)\n*   S1 Body T16 Start: [(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)]\n*   S1 Body T17 State: [(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7)]\n**Conclusion on S1 Move:** S1 moved **DOWN** from (9, 9) to (9, 8). They left the safe top wall to head towards the center mass of apples! Smart move, initiating the clash! They did NOT eat, so their length remains 9.\n\n### Target Assessment for Turn 17 from (0, 5):\n\n*   **My Head: (0, 5)**\n*   **S1 Head: (9, 8)** (Far away, but moving toward the conflict zone!)\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\n1.  **(0, 4)** - Move DOWN 1. HIGH priority!\n2.  **(3, 5)** - Move RIGHT 3. Next best option.\n3.  **(2, 8)** - Up and over.\n\n**Safety Check from (0, 5):**\nMy body is anchored to the left wall (X=0 and X=1).\n\n*   **UP to (0, 6):** Safe. Keeps me in the corner waiting.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 5):** This was my head location LAST turn. **DEAD MOVE!** This is my immediate tail segment (index 1 in my new body list). No suicide!\n*   **LEFT:** Off the board! DEAD!\n*   **DOWN to (0, 4):** **EAT THAT APPLE!** This looks like the strongest move. It grows us to length 8 and secures the bottom-left corner before S1 pushes too far down the map!\n\n### Predicted Simultaneous Movements (If I go DOWN to (0, 4)):\n\n*   **OUR MOVE:** (0, 5) -> **(0, 4)** [EAT!] Length 8. Score 7.\n*   **S1 Predicted Move (from 9, 8):** They are heading toward the central action. They might go RIGHT toward (7, 5) or DOWN toward (9, 7). If they go RIGHT to (8, 8) (moving away slightly), or DOWN to (9, 7) (continuing descent). Let's assume S1 prioritizes apples or staying mobile.\n    *   If S1 goes **DOWN to (9, 7)**: They are stalking the board edge.\n    *   If S1 goes **RIGHT to (8, 8)**: They are moving towards the middle apples near my previous pathing.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 4), I get bigger. A bigger snake is harder to box in! Getting a guaranteed apple now trumps overly defensive maneuvers unless a massive immediate threat exists, which it doesn't with S1 still on the far right edge.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** We are securing territory on the left wall and growing fast. S1 is trying to push down the right wall. We want to keep our width on the left side open so we can cut across rows 4, 5, 6 later to trap S1 against the top/right wall they just vacated. Keep eating the corners first! DOWN is the only way to get immediate content and growth here!\n\nDOWN it is! Let's get this coin!\n\nDOWN",

We are definitely the hungrier snake right now!\n\n**Current State Check (Post Turn 17):**\n*   My Head: **(0, 4)**\n*   My Body: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)] (Length 8!)\n*   S1 Head: (9, 7) (Assuming S1 played DOWN again, from (9, 8) to (9, 7) to keep hunting the edge!) - Let's verify this against the board!\n\n**Inferring S1's Position Change (Turn 17):**\n*   S1 Head T17 Start: (9, 8)\n*   S1 Head T18 State: (9, 7)\n*   **Conclusion on S1 Move:** S1 moved **DOWN** from (9, 8) to (9, 7). They are methodically creeping down the right wall! They likely did not eat. Length remains 9.\n\n### Target Assessment for Turn 18 from (0, 4):\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\n1.  **(3, 0)** - Move right 3.\n2.  **(6, 2)** - Far away!\n3.  **(7, 1)** - Very far away!\n\n**Safety Check from (0, 4):**\nMy body is mostly anchored on the X=0 and X=1 columns.\n\n*   **UP to (0, 5):** This is my immediate tail segment (index 1). **DEAD MOVE!** Cannot go back there.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 4):** This is my body segment index 3. **DEAD MOVE!** Cannot go there!\n*   **LEFT:** Off the board! DEAD!\n*   **DOWN to (0, 3):** New territory exploration! Safe.\n\n**Analyzing Potential Moves:**\n\n1.  **DOWN (0, 4) -> (0, 3):** This is the only immediately safe move that doesn't walk directly into my own segments! It keeps us tight against the left wall, moving us towards the bottom corner where (3, 0) lies eventually. It's safe, but slow.\n2.  **UP/RIGHT/LEFT:** All result in instant death because my tail has curled inward slightly at (0, 5) and (1, 4) blocks the rightward path!\n\nWait a minute, let me re-examine the body indices carefully after the last move (0, 5) -> (0, 4):\nMy Body: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)]\n\n*   Head (0, 4).\n*   Index 1 (Next to Head): (0, 5). Moving **UP** goes to (0, 5). **Self-Collision!**\n*   Index 2: (1, 5). Moving **RIGHT** goes to (1, 4). Wait, Index 3 is (1, 4). Moving RIGHT goes to (1, 5). Index 2 is (1, 5). **Self-Collision!** Let me check the actual coordinates:\n\n    *   Head: (0, 4)\n    *   **UP:** (0, 5). This is Index 1. **DEAD!**\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 3). Safe. Explores the bottom edge.\n    *   **LEFT:** (Out of bounds). **DEAD!**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (1, 4). This is Index 3. Moving to (1, 4) means moving *into* my own body! **DEAD!**\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:** My body configuration from the last move has trapped me! The only safe move is **DOWN** to (0, 3)! If I try UP, RIGHT, or LEFT, I die instantly!\n\nThis is the moment we prepare for the final confrontation! We must survive this turn and map the route toward the (3, 0) apple.\n\n**S1's Predicted Move (from 9, 7):**\nS1 is still on the right edge. If they go DOWN to (9, 6), they continue hugging the void. If they go LEFT to (8, 7), they start angling toward the center. Given they are winning on apples, they might play aggressively toward the apples near the center (like (7, 6) or (8, 7)). I need to assume they are looking for content too! If S1 goes LEFT to (8, 7), they are moving away from me rapidly. If S1 goes UP to (9, 8), they give up the bottom progress. Let's assume they continue the long march down the right edge: **DOWN to (9, 6)**.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** We are forced into a purely defensive/territorial move by our own tight coil. Survival is paramount! We move DOWN to (0, 3), positioning ourselves for the (3, 0) apple next turn. We must extend our path along the bottom edge (Y=0) to secure that apple and start curving leftwards eventually, while S1 is still wandering down the right wall. Survival means growth!\n\nThe only move that keeps me alive is DOWN. I must take it!\n\nDOWN",

Phew! Length 8 vs Length 9! We are getting closer, people! We HAVE to hunt that (3, 0) apple now!\n\n### Opponent's Predicted Move (Snake #1)\n\nLast seen at (9, 7), deep on the right edge. If they went DOWN to (9, 6) last turn, they are now at (9, 6). If they went LEFT to (8, 7)... wait, I need to trace their movement based on the board state provided for Turn 19!\n\n**S1 Head is (9, 6)** based on the board map!\nIf S1 Head is (9, 6), and last turn it was (9, 7)... **S1 moved DOWN!**\nS1 Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)] (Length 10 now? Hmm, the board shows 9 body segments listed. Let's trust the listed body count: 9 segments = Length 10 if they ate, but they are listed as 9 apples, so length 10 if they just ate, or length 9 if they didn't eat last turn.)\n\nLet's re-verify S1's length based on the input: Apples: 9. This means S1 has 10 segments (9 apples + 1 starting segment). The listed body has 9 points. **S1 is Length 10.** Did they eat an apple last turn?\nApple list check: (6, 2), (6, 5), (8, 2), (7, 5), (9, 3), (9, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (7, 6), (3, 0), (2, 8), (7, 1), (8, 7), (7, 4), (9, 2).\n\nThe apple at (8, 7) is gone! It turns out **S1 ATE (8, 7) LAST TURN!**\nIf S1 was at (9, 7) and ate at (8, 7), they moved **LEFT**, not DOWN! I misread my own tail tracking! Let's recalculate S1's move based on collision avoidance and board geometry!\n\nIf S1 Head was (9, 8) at T18 start:\n1. If S1 moved DOWN to (9, 7), they didn't eat. But (8, 7) is gone on the board! WHO ATE (8, 7)?\n2. My apples: 7. S1 apples: 9.\n3. If S1 ate at (8, 7), their head must have moved *to* (8, 7). The board shows S1 Head at (9, 6). This means S1's last move was NOT to (8, 7).\n\n**MUST TRUST THE BOARD STATE OVER INFERENCE!**\nTurn T19 State:\nMy Head: (0, 3) [Result of my DOWN move last turn]\nS1 Head: (9, 6)\nApple (8, 7) is GONE. Who ate it?\nIf S1 ate it, they must have moved from (9, 7) to (8, 7) or (8, 8) to (8, 7) etc. But their current head is (9, 6)!\n\n**CRITICAL ASSUMPTION:** Since the board shows the result of T18, and S1 is at (9, 6), they must have moved DOWN from (9, 7) OR UP from (9, 5) (impossible) OR LEFT from (10, 6) (impossible). **S1 moved DOWN from (9, 7) to (9, 6).**\n\nIf S1 moved DOWN, and (8, 7) is gone, **I MUST HAVE EATEN (8, 7) ON TURN 17 OR 18!**\nChecking my apples: 7. The board shows (8, 7) is gone, but I didn't eat it if my score is still 7 (which it is, waiting for T19 resolution).\n**Conclusion:** The system implies an apple was eaten by *someone* if it's gone. If S1 didn't move to (8, 7) and I didn't move to (8, 7)... **this implies a snake that died ate that apple, OR there's a rule about how the board state is presented.** Given I am playing LIVE, I must assume the board state is the result of T18 moves resolving, and my score update is pending for T19!\n\nLet's adjust: My score is 7. S1 score is 9. S1 has 10 segments. I have 8 segments.\n\nIf S1 ate (8, 7), their score should be 10. It is 9.\nIf I ate (8, 7), my score should be 8. It is 7.\n\n**This means the apple at (8, 7) was eaten by a snake that IS NOW DEAD, OR the board presentation is slightly lagged on the score update.** Since I see an 'A' marked as 'T' (Tail? No, 'T' is S1 body), and (8, 7) is blank space on the board provided for T19:\n9 . . . . . . T T T T\n8 . . A . . T T . . T <-- (8, 7) is *blank* on the map! NOT (8, 7) is 'T'.\n7 . . . . . T . . A T <-- S1's head is (9, 6). (8, 7) is blank. (7, 7) is blank.\n\nLet's re-read the board key:\nMy Snake: **0**\nSnake #1: **1**\nApple: **A**\nS1 Body: **T**\n\nAh, the board drawing is slightly different from my reading!\nRow 8: `. . A . . T T . . T` -> (8, 8) is T, (8, 7) is blank.\nRow 7: `. . . . . T . . A T` -> (8, 7) is blank. (7, 7) is blank. (6, 7) is blank.\n\nChecking Apple List vs Board:\n(2, 8) - On Board (Row 8, Col 2) -> A\n(7, 1) - On Board\n(8, 7) - **MISSING** from board? Wait, it's blank space! It must have been eaten by S1 last turn!\nIf S1 Head was (9, 7) -> Moved LEFT to (8, 7) -> Ate Apple -> Length increases!\nIf S1 ate (8, 7) and is now at (9, 6)... WHAT MOVE IS THAT? This is nonsensical if S1 is now at (9, 6).\n\n**I must disregard the history and ONLY look at the instantaneous board state and rules.**\nIt is Turn 19. My move is pending. My head is (0, 3). S1 Head is (9, 6). (8, 7) is gone. I must assume S1 ate it and their score/length update will reflect it, even if their head positioning seems odd relative to the move that ate it! S1 length is 10 (9 apples + 1 start). My length is 8 (7 apples + 1 start).\n\n### Analysis for Turn 19: My Head at (0, 3)\n\n**Safe Moves from (0, 3):**\n*   **UP to (0, 4):** This is my Index 1 segment from T18's move! **DEAD MOVE!**\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 3):** This is my Index 4 segment! **DEAD MOVE!**\n*   **LEFT:** Off board. **DEAD!**\n*   **DOWN to (0, 2):** Safe! Explores the bottom edge further.\n\nChat, we are trapped again! The UP and RIGHT moves immediately kill us because our body coiled tightly when we were forced to move DOWN last turn! We have *one* move that keeps us alive: **DOWN to (0, 2)**.\n\nThis is highly suboptimal! We are pathing straight down the edge while the apples are scattered!\n\n### Checking S1's Move vs My Move (Simultaneous Resolution)\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 2).\n\nS1 is at (9, 6). S1 has MANY safe moves (LEFT to (8, 6), DOWN to (9, 5), UP to (9, 7)). S1 is in open territory. They will absolutely move toward an apple or try to box me in later. They see the (7, 6) apple nearby. They will likely move LEFT to (8, 6) or UP to (9, 7) to try and claim (8, 7) positioning again. Let's assume S1 plays aggressively and moves **LEFT to (8, 6)**, aiming for the center cluster or attempting to cut off the bottom wall.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 2):\n1. Am I hitting S1's new position (8, 6)? No.\n2. Is S1 hitting my new position (0, 2)? No.\n3. Am I eating an apple? No.\n\nThe forced move is DOWN, just like last turn, but this time it sets us up even better for the (3, 0) apple IF we can wiggle out of this wall next turn! We need to hug the wall until we can swing right toward the corner!\n\n**Long Term Strategy:** We are playing defense due to our previous tight maneuver. We must complete the wall hug down to (0, 0), then turn RIGHT along Y=0 to snatch (3, 0). This is slow, but survival is the only priority when you are boxed in by your own previous safety move! We must bait S1 into overextending toward the center while we secure the easy bottom apples. We are the predator, even when forced to crawl!\n\nMy only safe move is DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

We gotta play smart, but we are OUT OF OPTIONS this turn!\n\nLet's dissect the situation from (0, 3)!\n\n**My Current Position: Head (0, 3). Body: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (0, 2)]** Wait, my body list from T18 was: `[(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)]` (Length 8). My last move was DOWN to (0, 2) which means my *new* head for T20 is (0, 2) and the body shifts!\n\n**Hold up! Last move picked was DOWN.** That move resulted in my T19 head being (0, 2) and the body shifting!\n**CURRENT HEAD FOR T20 RESOLUTION: (0, 2)**.\n\nLet's re-read the input based on the **LAST MOVE PICK** being executed to reach the current board state:\nMy T18 Head: (0, 2). My move: DOWN.\n=> My T19 Head: (0, 1). Wait, the board shows my head at (0, 2) for T20 start!\n\n**CRITICAL RE-EVALUATION OF THE INPUT:**\nThe prompt says: \"YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP): DOWN\".\nIf the board state shown *is* the result of that move, then my head for this turn (Turn 20) should be the result of that move resolving.\n\nIf my head at T19 start was (0, 3) (as implied by the rationale pointing to (0, 3) safety analysis), and I moved DOWN, my head should be at (0, 2).\n**Board Check:** My Head is (0, 2). PERFECT. My body follows.\nMy Body: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)] -> Wait, this list length is 7. If HEAD is (0, 2), the NEXT segment should be (0, 3)!\nThe board shows:\n2 0 T . . . . A . A A\n1 . . . . . . . A . .\n0 . . . A . . . . . A\n\nThe board shows my body segments are: (0, 2) HEAD, (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5) ... BUT THE LISTING SAYS:\nHead: (0, 2)\nBody: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)]\nIf Head is (0, 2), the next segment *must* be (0, 3) or whatever adjacent cell was *previously* the head. The list order is HEAD-TO-TAIL.\n\nIf Head is (0, 2), the list should be: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)...\nThe input lists: Head: (0, 2), Body: [(0, 3)...]. This means my total length is 8 segments (1 head + 7 body). This matches my score of 7 apples!\n\nOkay, the body alignment on the board map vs the list provided is confusing because the map shows the segments filling in exactly where segment 1 occupied in the previous turn, IF the move was safe.\n\nIf T19 Head was (0, 3) and we moved DOWN: New Head is (0, 2).\nMy T19 Body Segments (Old Head (0, 3) becomes Segment 2):\n(0, 3) -> (0, 2)\n(0, 4) -> (0, 3)\n(0, 5) -> (0, 4)\n...\n(1, 2) -> (1, 3) <-- TAIL MOVES OUT (Segment 8)\n\nSo, my T20 Head is definitively **(0, 2)**.\n\n**Safe Moves from (0, 2):** (x, y) coordinates.\n1. **UP to (0, 3):** This is my Segment 2! **DEAD MOVE!**\n2. **RIGHT to (1, 2):** This is my Segment 7 (the old tail)! **DEAD MOVE!** (Backwards move is into the cell behind the head *before* the move happens, but in this TIGHT configuration, (1, 2) is the tail, and moving there IS hitting my own body).\n3. **LEFT:** Off board. **DEAD!**\n4. **DOWN to (0, 1):** **SAFE MOVE!** This moves me down the wall segment closer to the potential (3, 0) apple path!\n\nCHAT, WE ARE IN THE SAME TRAP! My last move DOWN pushed me into a corner tighter than anticipated! We are forced to move DOWN again, off the edge of the existing body mass!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1)\nS1 Head is at (9, 6). They are relatively free. We must assume they go for the apple at (7, 6) or (7, 4) or try to move inward toward (8, 8). Since they are on the edge, they are looking central. **(8, 7) is gone, (7, 7) is open.** They might move LEFT to (8, 6), or UP to (9, 7).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (9, 7), they secure the top right corner.\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (8, 6), they start heading toward the center line where apples are clustered on rows 4-7.\n\nWe are forced DOWN to (0, 1). This is purely tactical survival forcing us to crawl towards the bottom edge. This move keeps the possibility of turning RIGHT at the bottom open.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Crawl down the wall to (0, 0). Turn RIGHT aggressively towards columns 3, 4, 5 to snatch (3, 0). We cannot afford any zig-zags until we clear row 1. This is the \"SNAIL STRATEGY\" until we hit the floor!\n\nStrategy Note for Next Turn (If we survive): Prioritize going RIGHT along Y=0 once we reach (0, 0) or (0, 1) if (0, 0) is blocked. We MUST get (3, 0).\n\nThe only move: DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! WHAT A GRIND! Turn 21! We just survived that absolute MUDDLE on the left wall! Our last move was forced, DOWN to (0, 1)! If we hadn't gone down, we would have smashed ourselves! Unbelievable clutch by the squad! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWe are currently at HEAD (0, 1). Length 8. Opponent Snake #1 has 9 apples, Length 10. We are behind, but we are ALIVE, and that\u2019s what matters! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's analyze the immediate surroundings of (0, 1):\nBODY: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)] (Wait, the body segments in the input list above were based on T19 state, let's re-validate the list based on the move DOWN executed LAST turn)\n\nIf HEAD (0, 2) moved DOWN to (0, 1):\nOld Head (0, 2) becomes Segment 2, which is now (0, 2).\nOld Segment 2 (0, 3) becomes Segment 3, which is now (0, 3).\n...\nOld Tail (1, 2) sloughs off. New Tail is (1, 3).\n\n**My T21 Body (HEAD-TO-TAIL):** [(0, 1) HEAD, (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)] (Length 8. YES, the TAIL segment (1, 2) is gone, and the new tail is (1, 3)!)\n\n**Safety Check from (0, 1):**\n1. **UP to (0, 2):** This is my Segment 2! **DEAD MOVE!**\n2. **RIGHT to (1, 1):** This cell is currently EMPTY! **SAFE MOVE!**\n3. **DOWN to (0, 0):** This cell is currently EMPTY! **SAFE MOVE!**\n4. **LEFT:** Off board! **DEAD!**\n\nWe have two safe moves: RIGHT to (1, 1) or DOWN to (0, 0).\n\n**Looking at Apples:**\nThe closest apple is (3, 0). If we go DOWN to (0, 0), we start proceeding along the bottom edge toward that apple ASAP. If we go RIGHT to (1, 1), we might maneuver slightly better but we are further away from the primary target at (3, 0).\n\n**Long Term Strategy Refinement:** We need to get established in the central columns (3-6) horizontally to start collecting that massive cluster of apples (3, 5), (3, 6), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)... The goal is to get to Y=0, move RIGHT, and then turn UP when we hit column 3 or 4.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (1, 1)**: We are still too close to the wall, and it might make turning UP or DOWN awkward next turn if we don't immediately commit LEFT or RIGHT.\nIf we go **DOWN to (0, 0)**: This commits us fully to the edge until we decide to run RIGHT along Y=0. This seems safer for pathing right now because it minimizes the chance of accidentally trapping ourselves against our own body segments which are running UP the X=0 column.\n\n**Opponent Snake #1 (S1) Prediction:**\nS1 Head: (9, 4). Body covers (9, 5) up to (9, 9) and then runs along Y=9. They are in the top right corner. They have apples (7, 7), (8, 7) available nearby.\nS1's safest path is likely LEFT towards the center, targeting (8, 6) or perhaps UP to clear the wall if they think they can reach area (9, 8) safely.\nIf S1 goes LEFT to (8, 4) or (8, 5), they are moving towards our general direction but are far away. If they go UP to (9, 5) (into their own body?) NO! They are at (9, 4), their body is (9, 5), (9, 6)... UP to (9, 3) is open. Wait, S1 Head is at (9, 4).\n\nBoard Check S1:\n9 . . . . . . T T T T (Y=9)\n8 . . A . . . T . . T (Y=8)\n7 . . . . . . . . A T (Y=7)\n6 . . . A . . . A . T (Y=6)\n5 T T . A . . A A . T (Y=5)\n4 T T . . . . . A . 1 (S1 Head is here? X=9, Y=4 -> (9, 4)!)\n\nAh, the board map labeling is confusing for S1!\nS1 Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8)] - This is a vertical snake on the right edge, running UP the 9th column, then across the 9th row.\nTHE INPUT LIST SAYS S1 HEAD IS (9, 4)!\n\nLet's trust the coordinates provided over the confusing board visuals if they contradict slightly.\nS1 Head at (9, 4).\nIf S1 moves UP to (9, 5) -> HITS OWN BODY (Segment 2)! **S1 MUST NOT GO UP.**\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (9, 3) -> EMPTY!\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (8, 4) -> EMPTY!\nIf S1 moves RIGHT -> Off Board!\n\nS1 likely goes DOWN to (9, 3) or LEFT to (8, 4). Both lead them towards the central action.\n\nIf S1 goes DOWN to (9, 3), they are heading for apple (9, 3) which is currently occupied by an apple! Wait, (9, 3) is an apple? No, (9, 3) is listed in the APPLE DROPS list! (9, 3) is an apple! If S1 moves to (9, 3), they eat an apple and grow!\n\nIf S1 eats (9, 3), they will be length 11 and further ahead! We need to make progress on our end without dying to this!\n\nSince S1 is likely moving DOWN or LEFT, moving **DOWN to (0, 0)** maximizes our pathing efficiency toward apple (3, 0) while maintaining maximal distance from S1 until we enter the central nexus. This feels like the survival play that keeps the target (3, 0) in sight.\n\n**PLAN:** Commit to the floor. Go DOWN to (0, 0). Then commit to going RIGHT along Y=0 until we reach a favorable turning point (X=3 or X=4). Survival first, then domination!\n\nExecuting DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Turn 22 starting now, and we need to pivot from pure survival to aggressive apple hunting. We are down 3 apples to Snake #1! We cannot let this slide! \ud83d\ude24\n\nCurrent Head: (0, 1).\nMy T22 Body (based on T21 MOVE DOWN): [(0, 1) HEAD, (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]. New Tail is (1, 3).\n\n**Safety Check from (0, 1):**\n1. **UP to (0, 2):** Collision with my body segment 2. **DEAD.**\n2. **RIGHT to (1, 1):** SAFE.\n3. **DOWN to (0, 0):** SAFE.\n4. **LEFT:** Off board. **DEAD.**\n\nSafe Moves: RIGHT (1, 1) or DOWN (0, 0).\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #1):**\nS1 Head at (9, 4). Potential moves: DOWN (9, 3) or LEFT (8, 4).\nIf S1 goes DOWN to (9, 3), they eat apple (9, 3)! They gain length and score! We MUST deny them this easy expansion if possible, but we are 10 units away!\n\n**Apple Landscape:**\nClosest apple for us is (3, 0). We have a clear path of empty space toward it if we hug the bottom edge.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n1. **DOWN to (0, 0):** Commits us to the bottom wall. Path to (3, 0) is direct: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT... Next turn we can move RIGHT to (1, 0). This seems structurally solid for gaining ground across the bottom.\n2. **RIGHT to (1, 1):** This moves us slightly into open space, but it delays our committed run along the safe bottom edge. If we move to (1, 1), next turn we could go RIGHT to (2, 1) or DOWN to (1, 0). Going DOWN to (1, 0) seems better to meet the floor requirement.\n\nSince S1 is expanding on the right side, we need to secure our corner and start moving into the center mass of apples ASAP. The path $(0, 1) \\to (0, 0) \\to (1, 0) \\to (2, 0) \\to (3, 0) \\text{ (EAT APPLE!)}$ is the most reliable route to get our score up. Any time spent meandering near the walls when we have a clear edge path is wasted time!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN for the next few turns:** Commit to the floor (Y=0) and run RIGHT aggressively until we hit X=4 or X=5, then turn UP towards the cluster of apples at Y=4/Y=5. We must out-eat S1! We will prioritize collecting (3, 0) first.\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 0) initiates this aggressive floor push! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",
