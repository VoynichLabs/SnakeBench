This means our head is at (9, 7).\n- Our last move was UP, so the head should be at (9, 6), but based on the description, the current position is (9, 7). It seems there's a slight inconsistency, but since the \"last move\" was UP, we will assume the current head is now at (9, 6).\n\n- The apple at (9, 6) is directly above our current head (assuming at (9, 6)), which means moving UP now would result in eating that apple \u2014 this aligns with the previous rationale to go UP.\n\n- Moving UP from (9, 6) to (9, 7) would hit the body segment at (9, 6), causing a collision. But the snake's body segments are at [(9, 6), (9, 5)]. Since the head was at (9, 5) before moving UP, moving UP would go to (9, 6), which is occupied by the body segment (assuming the snake grows after eating).\n\n- Wait, earlier, we assumed our head was at (9, 7). But if the body is at [(9, 6), (9, 5)] and the head is at (9, 7), that doesn't make sense because that would mean the snake is two segments long, with head at (9, 7), body at (9, 6), and tail at (9, 5). The initial positioning states the snake is at (9, 7) with body at [(9, 6), (9, 5)], so the head is at (9, 7), and the body is tightly behind at (9, 6) and (9, 5). If the last move was UP, then the head shifted from (9, 6) to (9, 7).\n\n- Therefore, the current position of the head: (9, 7). The body is at [(9, 6), (9, 5)].\n\n- The apple at (9, 6) is directly below the head at (9, 7), so moving DOWN would be the move to eat it.\n\n- Moving UP again would take us away from the apple and possibly into empty space, but moving DOWN would get us onto the apple at (9, 6).\n\n- The previous decision was to move UP for the purpose of reaching the apple at (9, 6), but given this clarification, it's better to go DOWN to eat that apple immediately.\n\n- Now, considering safety:\n\n  - Moving DOWN to (9, 6): Is that safe? The cell (9, 6) is occupied by the body segment, so moving onto it would cause collision \u2014 not good.\n\n  - Moving UP to (9, 8): Is that safe? (9, 8) is empty and not blocked by any snake or obstacle.\n\n  - Moving RIGHT to (10, 7): outside the board \u2014 invalid.\n\n  - Moving LEFT to (8, 7): not directly towards any apple and not optimal now.\n\n- The apple at (9, 6) is just below us, so to eat it, we need to move DOWN, but that leads to collision with our body. So that's not a safe move.\n\n- Moving UP to (9, 8): safe, but doesn't bring us closer to an apple.\n\n- Alternatively, heading towards other apples:\n\n  - Apple at (8, 0): requires moving left and down multiple steps \u2014 not immediate.\n\n  - Apple at (7, 7): far away, not immediate.\n\n  - Apple at (4, 9): far far away.\n\n  - Apple at (6, 8): closer than others, but still require multiple steps.\n\nGiven that, the immediate, safe move to progress and avoid collisions is to move UP, heading to (9, 8), which is free.\n\n**Next, strategy:**\n\n- Prioritize safety; avoid collisions.\n\n- Plan to reach other apples in subsequent moves.\n\n- Since the apple at (9, 6) is unreachable (occupied by our body), we should pursue a safe, nearby apple or safe space.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Move UP to (9, 8), which is safe and potentially leads us closer to the apple at (9, 9) if we get there, or to explore other pathways.\n\n**Final decision:** UP"
