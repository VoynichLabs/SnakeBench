From there:\n- I could move UP to (8, 3) next turn to grab the apple there\n- This is a direct path to a nearby apple\n- Keeps options open (I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT from (8, 2))\n\nDOWN takes me to (9, 1):\n- Moves me further from all apples\n- Takes me to the edge\n- Limits future options\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT is strategically better because:\n1. It's safe\n2. It positions me to collect the apple at (8, 3) next turn\n3. It keeps me away from the board edge\n4. It maintains flexibility for future moves\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n- Turn 1: Move LEFT to (8, 2)\n- Turn 2: Move UP to (8, 3) to collect apple\n- Turn 3+: Continue working toward other apples, likely heading left to the (3, 4), (3, 6) cluster\n\nLEFT",
