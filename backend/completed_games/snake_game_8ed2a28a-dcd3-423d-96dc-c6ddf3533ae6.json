Moving **LEFT** would slam it into its own tail, instant suicide. So we\u2019ve got a *closed* door, but the other three directions are wide open.  \n\nWhat about **UP**? \ud83d\ude80  \n- Heading to (3,\u202f9) gives us instant wall\u2011top status. Cool, we can later swing left across the roof and box the rival. But think about *future* options: we\u2019re stuck at the ceiling. If the enemy sneaks up, we can\u2019t drop down to intercept \u2013 we\u2019re forced into a one\u2011way street. Also, we\u2019re not on any apple now, and the nearest apple at (0,\u202f9) is still a stretch away. *Is a top\u2011row sprint worth losing maneuverability?* Not sure.\n\n**DOWN**?  \n- Pushes us to (3,\u202f7), which feels safe and might eventually let us snake toward the low\u2011row apples (5,\u202f0) and (5,\u202f1). But the enemy can also go **DOWN** (to 5,\u202f6) and stay parallel, squeezing the vertical gap. If we keep dropping, the board tightens and we risk running into a *dead\u2011end* on the left or right. *Are we willing to gamble on a vertical chase when the left side still offers a clear path to a corner?* Hmm.\n\n**LEFT**?  \n- Slides us to (2,\u202f8). That keeps the head one cell above the enemy\u2019s head (5,\u202f7) and also preserves the classic \u201cwiggle\u2011room\u201d combo: after this move, we can still go **UP**, **DOWN**, or **LEFT** next turn (but **RIGHT** would be a back\u2011into\u2011our\u2011own\u2011body blunder \u2013 love that moment of self\u2011awareness!). \ud83c\udfaf  \n\nWhy is left the *sweet spot*?  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Immediate kill\u2011potential** \u2013 If Snake\u202f#1 decides to go **DOWN**, its head will land at (5,\u202f6). Our tail after the left move will be at (3,\u202f8). That\u2019s still safe, but here\u2019s the real trick: if they try to *mimic* us and go **LEFT** later (which they can\u2019t right now), they\u2019ll be forced into a collision. More importantly, by staying one row above them we *force* them to either:  \n   - **UP** (moving farther away),  \n   - **DOWN** (getting closer to us vertically), or  \n   - **RIGHT** (moving sideways, which gives us time to tighten the left\u2011wall trap).  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Future corner\u2011domination** \u2013 Continuing left will march us toward column\u202f0. Once we hit x\u202f=\u202f0, we lock that wall. Then a quick **UP** to (0,\u202f9) grabs the apple there and creates an *impenetrable* barrier on the left side. Snake\u202f#1 can\u2019t slip left any longer; any attempt to go north will slam into our head\u2011on wall, and if they try to go south they\u2019ll either crash into our body or be forced into a head\u2011on collision when we finally swing **DOWN** after a brief **UP**. \ud83c\udf89  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Apple proximity** \u2013 The apple at (0,\u202f9) sits right at the corner we\u2019re chasing. After we claim it, we\u2019ll have *three* extra segments, turning us into a veritable *mountain* of threat. Meanwhile, the enemy is still at y\u202f\u2248\u202f7, so we\u2019ll have a massive *head\u2011start* in segment count. *Can we afford to ignore the immediate apple and chase the enemy?* Absolutely \u2013 a higher\u2011segment snake *must* be the long\u2011term win.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Self\u2011collision safety** \u2013 Moving left means our next head position can\u2019t be (3,\u202f8) (our own body) unless we go **RIGHT**, which we\u2019re not allowed to do right now. So we stay safe and *don\u2019t* commit the classic \u201cI\u2019m about to bite my own tail\u201d mistake.  \n\n**Long\u2011term plan (think\u2011backwards):**  \n- Turn\u202f4: **LEFT** \u2192 head (2,\u202f8).  \n- Turns\u202f5\u2011? Continue **LEFT** until we hit x\u202f=\u202f0 (head at (0,\u202f8), body fills columns 1\u20119).  \n- Once the left wall is locked, **UP** to (0,\u202f9) for the apple. This *creates* a vertical wall that cuts the board in half.  \n- Next, a quick **DOWN** (or **RIGHT**) can force Snake\u202f#1 into a head\u2011on dash into our body or into the top\u2011left corner where we already dominate.  \n- If they try to slip left, they\u2019re dead; if they try to go up, they\u2019ll smash into our head at (0,\u202f9) and we win *instantly*.  \n\nRemember, the enemy\u2019s only safe direction after we left\u2011wall them is **RIGHT** (toward the middle) \u2013 that gives us the perfect chance to *cut them off* with a **DOWN** swing.  \n\n**So what\u2019s the verdict?**  \n\n- **UP** limits us.  \n- **DOWN** risks vertical boxing.  \n- **LEFT** unlocks a *strategic corner* that will turn us into an unstoppable force.  \n\n**Final move:**  \n\n```\nLEFT\n```",

That\u2019s a no\u2011go. \ud83d\udc0d  \n\n\ud83d\udd2e **What if we go UP?**  \n- Head would land on (2,9). Safe right now, but we\u2019d be stuck on the ceiling. Next turn the enemy could zip left twice and bounce straight into our head\u2011on line, leaving us with only one escape lane (down). Not the safest long\u2011term tightrope. \ud83e\udd14  \n\n\ud83d\udcc9 **What if we go DOWN?**  \n- We\u2019d slide to (2,7), pulling us away from the prime left\u2011wall real estate. While safe, we\u2019d lose momentum on our march to column\u202f0, giving the rival time to snake around and set up a vertical chase. \ud83d\udc22  \n\n\u2705 **What if we go LEFT?**  \n- Head would become (1,8). This is a clean, non\u2011collision move and continues our march toward the left edge. \ud83c\udfaf  \n- If we keep crawling left, two more turns and we\u2019ll lock column\u202f0 at row\u202f8 (head at (0,8), tail at (1,8)). At that point the apple at (0,9) is begging to be claimed \u2013 a sweet +1 segment that turns our little 2\u2011segment snake into a 3\u2011segment power\u2011wall! \ud83d\udca5  \n- After snagging the corner apple, we can slam DOWN to plant a vertical wall from top to bottom, squeezing the rival out. The enemy can\u2019t slip left once we own the entire column; any head\u2011on attempt will be a double\u2011KO (we\u2019ll win). \ud83d\udd25  \n\n\u2694\ufe0f **Enemy\u2019s playbook?**  \n- Snake\u202f#1\u2019s safe options: UP \u2192 (5,9), LEFT \u2192 (4,8), RIGHT \u2192 (6,8). None of those threaten us if we keep moving left. If they go LEFT, they\u2019ll be forced to a parallel path that we can later cut off with a DOWN\u2011swing. If they go UP, they\u2019ll end up on row\u202f9 while we head for column\u202f0, creating a clear north\u2011south chase. If they go RIGHT, they\u2019ll drift farther away, giving us more breathing room. \ud83c\udfaf  \n\n\ud83e\udde0 **LONG\u2011TERM GAME PLAN (think\u2011backwards):**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f6: **LEFT** \u2192 head (1,8), tail (2,8).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f7: **LEFT** \u2192 head (0,8), tail (1,8).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f8: **UP** \u2192 grab apple at (0,9) \u2192 +1 segment, lock the top\u2011left corner.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f9\u201112: **DOWN** repeatedly, building a vertical wall on column\u202f0 (tail trails down, head stays at (0,8) \u2192 (0,7) \u2192 \u2026).  \n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Once the wall is full, any attempt by the rival to move left will kill them instantly. If they try to go up they\u2019ll collide head\u2011on with our head at (0,9) and we win double\u2011KO. \ud83c\udfc1  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Bottom line:** Continuing LEFT is the move that both secures our survival and sets the stage for a dominant wall that forces a decisive head\u2011on showdown.

Not ideal for dominating the board.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,8) \u2013 gets us on the left border instantly, priming the top\u2011left apple (0,9) next turn, but we\u2019d waste a turn before reaching that prize.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 illegal \u2013 our own tail (2,8) blocks the path. \ud83d\udc4e\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Why UP wins?**  \n- It\u2019s the only move that *right now* delivers **content** \u2013 we eat the apple at (1,9) and extend our body, giving us a bigger shield for the later wall.  \n- After the bite we can **LEFT** to (0,9) (the top\u2011left apple) and then **DOWN** repeatedly, building a full column\u202f0 wall that traps the enemy.  \n- The opponent\u2019s best safe reply (LEFT or UP) won\u2019t threaten us this round, so we stay alive and set the stage for a decisive head\u2011on later.  \n\n\ud83e\udde0 **NEXT\u2011TURN PLAYBOOK**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **UP** \u2013 claim the apple at (1,9) and become 2\u2011segment longer.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **LEFT** \u2013 lock the corner apple at (0,9) and peg the top row.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **DOWN** \u2013 hammer down column\u202f0, forging an unbreakable wall that forces any left\u2011ward move from the rival into instant death.  \n\n\ud83e\uddee **Score edge:** we\u2019ll be ahead 2\u20111 after the first bite, giving us the confidence to push the enemy into a forced head\u2011on collision.  \n\nUP",

Staying in this narrow corridor keeps the board tightly controlled.  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Grab the apple @ (0,6)** \u2013 Moving **DOWN** lands on an apple, grows me to length\u202f4, and boosts my lead 3\u21924 apples.

Its only safe directions are LEFT (to 1,8), RIGHT (to 3,8) or DOWN (to 2,7).
