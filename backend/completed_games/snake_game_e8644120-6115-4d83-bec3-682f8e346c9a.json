(Apple at (0, 1) - free grow!)\n- **RIGHT** to (1, 0): \u2705 SAFE! (Apple at (1, 0) - also free grow!)\n- **DOWN** or **LEFT**: \u274c DEAD (off board)\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe and give us apples. But which gives better board control?\n\n- **UP to (0, 1)**: Gets us apple (0, 1), keeps us on left edge but opens upward path. We can then go RIGHT to (1, 1) which also has an apple!\n- **RIGHT to (1, 0)**: Gets us apple (1, 0), moves us right but we're still on bottom edge. Next turn we could go UP to (1, 1) for another apple.\n\nWait! Both paths lead to (1, 1) eventually! But (0, 1) is more central and gives us better positioning to control the left side of the board. The enemy is on the right side (9,5), so controlling left is smart.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Dominate the left side of the board. Move UP to (0, 1), then RIGHT to (1, 1), then work our way up the left-middle column. We'll build a wall and box enemy into the right side. If they try to cross, we force a head-on collision when we have the size advantage.\n\n**DECISION:** Moving UP to grab that apple and establish position! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

Instant death. Nope. \ud83d\udeab\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,5): Empty, safe. Moves me toward the apple cluster/center and keeps multiple escape options. \u2705\n- UP \u2192 (9,6): Empty, safe. Keeps space but doesn't advance toward the opponent/apples as fast. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,4): Empty, safe. Also ok, but less aggressive. \u2705\n\nRisk check: Opponent head at (0,0) \u2014 no immediate head-on threat this turn. Both scores 0, so I should avoid suicidal head-on ties later unless I hold a lead. For now we want to close the gap and pressure their approach to the left-side apple cluster.\n\nFans want aggression + safety: LEFT is the best mix \u2014 it moves toward the apples/opponent side, keeps multiple follow-ups (UP/DOWN/LEFT again), and avoids wall suicide. Let's start cutting the board in half and force them into a corner.\n\nPlan (for next few turns):\n- Push left toward x\u22485 while maintaining vertical flexibility (use UP/DOWN to mirror their approach).\n- Corner their approach to the (0,x) apples by threatening to cut off escape routes; only go for head-on if we secure an apple lead.\n- Prioritize creating longer body segments near the center so I can box them against the left wall.\n\nLEFT",

Empty cell.\n- **RIGHT to (1, 1)**: \u2705 SAFE!

We're on the left edge. The goal is to control the board and force a head-on collision since we have the score advantage (1-0).\n\n- **RIGHT to (1, 1)**: This grabs an apple, growing us to length 3. This move brings us more central, gives us better positioning to potentially move toward the enemy's zone.\n- **UP to (0, 2)**: This stays on the left edge. While safe, it's less aggressive and keeps us isolated.\n\nSince we have the score advantage and want to be AGGRESSIVE, **RIGHT to (1, 1)** is the better move. It grabs an apple (grow our lead to 2-0!) and moves us toward the center of the board, putting pressure on the enemy's position. We need to close the distance to force that head-on collision!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Next turn from (1, 1), we'll have options to go UP to (1, 2) or RIGHT to (2, 1). Both should be safe. We'll continue moving rightward/upward, building our size advantage, and trying to cut off the enemy's movement.

Let's analyze:  \n\n**My Snake (ID 0):**  \nHead: (1, 1)  \nBody: [(0, 1), (0, 0)]  \nApples: 2  \nLength: 3 (Head + 2 body segments)  \n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**  \nHead: (7, 5)  \nBody: none  \nApples: 0  \nLength: 1  \n\n**Board State Recap:**  \nWe're at (1, 1). Apples are plentiful, but we're hunting the enemy! The enemy is on the right side at (7, 5). We need to close the gap and force a head-on collision since we're ahead in apples.  \n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL ANALYSIS:**  \nPossible moves from (1, 1):  \n- **UP to (1, 2):** \u2705 SAFE (empty, based on board state)  \n- **DOWN to (1, 0):** \u2705 SAFE (but there's an apple at (1, 0) - we'd grow, but moving down might not be aggressive)  \n- **LEFT to (0, 1):** \u274c DEAD (into our own body at (0, 1))  \n- **RIGHT to (2, 1):** \u2705 SAFE (empty, based on board state)  \n\nSo we have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**  \n- **DOWN to (1, 0):** Grab an apple and grow to length 4. But we're moving away from the enemy (who's at x=7, y=5). That's passive; we want to pressure them.  \n- **UP to (1, 2):** Move toward the center/upward, staying safe. This keeps options open for future moves toward the enemy.  \n- **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Move rightward, getting closer to the enemy's side. This is aggressive and aligns with our goal to box them in.  \n\nSince we're ahead in apples (2-0) and want to force a head-on collision, we need to reduce the distance to the enemy. Moving RIGHT brings us closer in x-coordinate (2 vs 7) while keeping y similar. UP is also decent but less direct.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Next turn from (2, 1), we'll have options to go RIGHT to (3, 1) or UP to (2, 2) or DOWN to (2, 0). We'll continue moving rightward to close in on the enemy, while watching for apples to maintain growth. If the enemy moves toward us, we might set up a collision where we win by score.  \n\n**DECISION:** Moving RIGHT to advance toward the enemy and apply pressure! \ud83d\udcaa  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**  \n\nRIGHT",

Let's analyze this gridlock!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Snake:** Head (4,1), Body [(3,1), (2,1)] - Length 3, 2 apples \u2705\n- **Enemy:** Head (5,4), Body [(5,5)] - Length 2, 1 apple \u274c\n- **Score:** 2-1 (They ate the apple at (5,4)!)\n- **Distance:** Manhattan = |5-4| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 units\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\nFrom head (4,1):\n- **UP to (4,2):** \u2705 SAFE (empty on board)\n- **DOWN to (4,0):** \u2705 SAFE (empty - apple at (1,0) is 3 units left)\n- **LEFT to (3,1):** \u274c DEAD (my own body - neck cell!)\n- **RIGHT to (5,1):** \u2705 SAFE (empty on board)\n\n**STRATEGIC MURDER PLOT UPDATE:**\nEnemy at (5,4) moved from (5,5) to (5,4) - they ate the apple! Now length 2, growing. My plan from last turn: RIGHT to (4,1) was executed. Now I need to continue the trap!\n\n**THE BOX-IN STRATEGY:**\nFrom (4,1), if I go **RIGHT to (5,1)**:\n- I'm now directly UNDER them (x=5, y=1 vs their x=5, y=4)\n- Distance collapses to 3 units vertical\n- Next turn I can go UP to (5,2), then UP to (5,3) - boxing them against the top!\n- They're stuck with no apples nearby except maybe (3,8) which is far.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nFrom (5,4), they have:\n- LEFT to (5,3) - empty\n- RIGHT to (6,4) - empty\n- DOWN to (5,3) - same as left\n- UP to (5,5) - empty (but they just came from there)\n\nThey might try to flee east or west, but with me at (5,1) blocking south, and the wall at y=9 above, they're running out of room!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 5: RIGHT to (5,1) - claim the vertical column\nTurn 6: UP to (5,2) - cut off escape\nTurn 7: UP to (5,3) - CLOSING THE TRAP!\nTurn 8: If they're still at (5,4), I force head-on collision from below (I win 2-1 apples!)\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- LEFT (3,1) = DEATH\n- UP (4,2) = Safe but delays murder plot\n- DOWN (4,0) = Safe but moves away from enemy\n- RIGHT (5,1) = BEST - aggressive, maintains trap, keeps options open\n\nCHAT, WE'RE TAKING THE FIGHT TO THEM! TIME TO CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE!\n\nRIGHT",

They cannot reach (5,3) this turn, so DOWN is safe from a simultaneous head-to-head.\n- We\u2019re down 1 apple (1 vs 2). Grabbing apples now is priority so we can force collisions later.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Immediate apple at (5,3) ties us into the fight \u2014 we need apples to enable safe head-on plays later.\n- It\u2019s safe this turn (opponent can\u2019t contest that cell simultaneously) and keeps multiple escape options next turn (left/right/down).\n- After eating we can pivot right toward the row-3 apples (6,3\u21927,3) or turn left to start herding the rival toward the left wall. Gain points first, then box.\n\nShort-term plan (for next 2\u20133 turns):\n1) DOWN to (5,3) and eat the apple.\n2) Next turn evaluate: if opponent commits upward, push right along y=3 to chain apples (6,3\u21927,3). If they try to close, pivot left to herd them into x=0 wall and force mistakes.\n3) Only force head-on once we\u2019re tied or ahead on apples.\n\nLET\u2019S STEAL THIS W LFG \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

Right move keeps us alive and hunting.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 7: RIGHT to (7,1) - maintain right flank advantage\nTurn 8: UP to (7,2) - approach center from east\nTurn 9: Read enemy - if they chase east, I swing north to cut off\nTurn 10: Box them in when I have clearer positional advantage!\n\n**FINAL CALL: LEADING WITH SAFETY!**\n\nRIGHT",

They cannot go LEFT (into neck at 7,1).\n- Safe options for us: UP (7,5), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4).\n\nEliminate deadly plays:\n- DOWN \u2014 insta-death (backwards). Not happening.\n\nAssess remaining moves:\n- UP (7,5): safe, keeps many exits, but drifts away from the opponent and cedes initiative. Not ideal when we\u2019re ahead and want to force contact.\n- LEFT (6,4): safe, but tucks us toward our own body and the left cluster of apples; slower to pressure the rival and can reduce direct attack options.\n- RIGHT (8,4): safe and aggressive \u2014 moves us toward their column. From there we can pivot down (8,3) \u2192 (8,2) and threaten a confrontation around their approach to the bottom apples (8,2)/(9,2)/(9,3). Since we lead 4\u20133, forcing a head-on or making them bite our body is in our favor.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- Opponent could grab the (8,2) apple to tie us on their next move. That\u2019s OK \u2014 we want to control how the clash happens. Moving RIGHT does not create immediate suicide risk and increases our ability to trap them toward the bottom wall.\n- LEFT/UP are more passive; RIGHT keeps options open (up/left/down later) while closing distance to the enemy.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to (8,4).\n- Then head down toward (8,3) and (8,2) to contest their approach to the bottom apples. Use our superior score to bait a head-on (if they overcommit) or cut off escape routes along x=8/9 and the bottom wall.\n- Avoid collapsing our own escape routes \u2014 keep at least two exits while forcing them toward the wall.\n\nFinal call \u2014 let\u2019s go pressure them and force the collision on our terms.

We\u2019re tied 4\u20134, so we CANNOT risk a head-on KO right now.\n- RIGHT to (9,4) is safe and aggressive, but it hugs the right wall and narrows our next-move options (only UP or DOWN next). It also sets up a tempting apple skirmish at (9,3) that could turn into a double KO if both chase it.\n- UP to (8,5) is safe, keeps more escape routes (can go up/left/right next), avoids immediate head-on risk, and preserves initiative to pivot and trap later.\n\nOpponent read: from (8,2) they can go UP (8,3), RIGHT (9,2 \u2014 apple), or LEFT (7,2).

If they try to come straight up, we\u2019ll sidestep and use our extra maneuverability to hem them toward the wall.\n- Maintain at least two escape options each turn; force them toward edges and into their own body when possible.\n\nTime to move \u2014 safe, flexible, and still aggressive.

If they go **DOWN to (8, 5)**, they're hitting their own body and DIE. But I can't control them. What I CAN control is positioning.\n\nIf I go **UP to (9, 4)**, I'm moving away from the enemy at (8, 6). They're 2 units away vertically and 1 unit away horizontally. No immediate collision threat.\n\n**THE MURDER PLOT:**\nLook at the enemy's body: [(8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)]\nIf I go **LEFT to (8, 3)**, I'm at (8, 3). The enemy's body is at (7, 3) \u2014 that's **NOT** a collision! Their head is at (8, 6), which could come to (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 6), or (9, 6). None of those are (8, 3). So **LEFT is SAFE**.\n\n**BUT HERE'S THE PLAY:**\nIf I go **UP to (9, 4)**, I'm staying on the right wall. The apple at (8, 9) is reachable later. The apple at (9, something) might appear. I'm keeping my right side open.\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (8, 3)**, I'm moving into the board. From (8, 3), my next moves could be:\n- UP to (8, 4) \u2014 but (8, 4) is enemy's body! So that would be DEATH if I go there.\n- DOWN to (8, 2) \u2014 my body is at (9, 2), not (8, 2), so that's empty.\n- LEFT to (7, 3) \u2014 enemy body at (7, 3)! DEAD!\n- RIGHT to (9, 3) \u2014 my previous position, empty.\n\nSo from (8, 3), I'd have only 2 safe moves: DOWN to (8, 2) or RIGHT to (9, 3). That's **TRAPPING MYSELF**! I don't want that.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**UP to (9, 4)** keeps me on the wall with more options:\n- From (9, 4): UP to (9, 5), LEFT to (8, 4) [but (8, 4) is enemy body], DOWN to (9, 3) [empty], RIGHT is off board.\n\nActually, from (9, 4), LEFT to (8, 4) is DEATH (enemy body). So from (9, 4), I have:\n- UP to (9, 5) \u2014 safe\n- DOWN to (9, 3) \u2014 safe\n- LEFT to (8, 4) \u2014 DEAD\n\nSo I'd have 2 moves. Same as (8, 3). BUT (9, 4) is closer to the top where apples like (8, 9) are. Also, staying on the wall is safer \u2014 I don't get surrounded.\n\n**THE AGGRESSION PLAY:**\nI have a 2-apple lead (6-4). I don't need to force a head-on collision yet. I need to **SECURE THE LEAD** and **CONTROL THE BOARD**.\n\nIf I go UP to (9, 4), I'm:\n- Moving toward apples at top\n- Staying out of enemy's body\n- Keeping distance from enemy head (at 8,6)\n- Avoiding immediate traps\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 12: UP to (9, 4) \u2014 move toward top apples, maintain board control\nTurn 13: Assess enemy \u2014 if they go RIGHT to (9, 6), I might be able to loop around and trap them later\nTurn 14+: Use my length to cut off their access to apples, force them into corner\n\n**CHAT, I'M TAKING THE HIGH ROAD!

(I predicted they might go left or right, but they chose left!)\n- **Enemy Body:** [(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5)] \u2014 They shifted their body, their tail is now at (8, 5).\n- **Enemy Apples:** 4 \u2014 Still trailing!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS (FROM (9, 6)):**\n- **UP to (9, 7):** \u2705 SAFE (empty on board)\n- **DOWN to (9, 5):** \u2705 SAFE (my previous position, empty now)\n- **LEFT to (8, 6):** \u274c **DEAD!** Enemy body! Their tail is at (8, 5), but wait... let's check the board state. The enemy head is at (7, 8). The enemy body segments shown are (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5). So (8, 6) IS occupied by enemy body. Can't go there.\n- **RIGHT:** \u274c OFF BOARD - DEAD!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS (FROM (7, 8)):**\nThey are at (7, 8) with body trailing behind them to the right. They could move:\n- **UP to (7, 9):** Safe (empty on board) \u2014 cornering themselves?\n- **DOWN to (7, 7):** Safe (empty on board) \u2014 moving away from me.\n- **LEFT to (6, 8):** Safe (empty on board) \u2014 continuing their retreat?\n- **RIGHT to (8, 8):** **DEAD!** That's their own body! The segment (8, 8) is part of their body (the one that used to be their head). If they move right, they crash into themselves.\n\n**THE TRAP IS CLOSING!**\nLook at the enemy's position! They are at (7, 8). They are basically trapped in the top-left quadrant (x=6-9, y=6-9) by their own body on column 8. They cannot go right! If they go down, they go further down the left side (x=7,7...). If they go up, they hit the top wall (y=9). If they go left, they go to x=6.\n\n**MY MOVE:**\nI am at (9, 6). I am pinned to the right wall. I need to move **UP** or **DOWN**.\n- **DOWN to (9, 5):** Moves me back to my previous spot. It's safe, but I'm not advancing. I'm letting the enemy potentially eat an apple if one drops there or continue escaping left. I want to apply pressure!\n- **UP to (9, 7):** \u2705 **BEST MOVE!** This moves me closer to the top-right corner (9,9). It keeps me on the right wall. It positions me to potentially cut off the top row if the enemy decides to go up to (7,9) or (6,9). It also keeps me away from my own body (downwards) and the enemy (leftwards).\n\n**STRATEGIC REASONING:**\n1.  **Aggression:** I have the lead (6-4). I need to force the issue. Moving UP keeps me on the attack vector.\n2.  **Positioning:** By moving UP to (9, 7), I am controlling the right side. The enemy is at (7, 8). The distance between us is closing (Manhattan distance is |9-7| + |7-8| = 2 + 1 = 3). If I keep going UP and they keep going LEFT, the distance increases. But if they panic and go UP or DOWN, I can adjust.\n3.  **Safety:** (9, 7) is empty. My body is below me. The enemy is far away on the left (x=7). I am safe.\n4.  **Long Term:** I want to secure the top-right corner (9,9) if possible. It's a strong defensive point. But more importantly, I want to force the enemy into the corner (6,9) or (7,9) where they have limited moves. By going UP, I maintain vertical parity with them.\n\n**CHAT, THEY ARE SWEATING IN THE CORNER! I'M GOING UP TO PUSH THEM INTO THE WALL!**\n\nUP",

Instead, grow safely when apples give positional leverage and then cut off their retreat later.\n- Aim to out-length them and close their escape to the left column when their head gets high and their tail movement opens a lane we can seal. Force them into a tight zone and only consider head-on if we have equal-or-greater apples.\n\nMake the safe, aggressive positional play: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Retreating!\n- **Enemy Body:** [(7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6)] \u2014 Their tail is at (8, 6).\n- **Enemy Apples:** 4 \u2014 Still trailing!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS (FROM (9, 7)):**\n- **UP to (9, 8):** \u2705 SAFE (empty on board) \u2014 Moving closer to the top-right corner.\n- **DOWN to (9, 6):** \u274c **DEAD!** My own body is there! (The segment from my previous move).\n- **LEFT to (8, 7):** \u2705 SAFE (empty on board) \u2014 Moving closer to the enemy.\n- **RIGHT:** \u274c OFF BOARD - DEAD!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS (FROM (6, 8)):**\nThey are at (6, 8). Their body blocks (7, 8) and (8, 8). They could move:\n- **UP to (6, 9):** Safe (empty on board) \u2014 Cornering themselves at (6,9).\n- **DOWN to (6, 7):** Safe (empty on board) \u2014 Moving down the left side.\n- **LEFT to (5, 8):** Safe (empty on board) \u2014 Continuing retreat.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 8):** **DEAD!** That's their own body (the segment behind their head).\n\n**THE TRAP IS SPRINGING!**\nI am at (9, 7). The enemy is at (6, 8). The gap is closing.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (8, 7), I move directly toward the enemy. The Manhattan distance becomes 2.\nIf they panic and go **UP** to (6, 9) or **DOWN** to (6, 7), I can chase.\nIf they go **LEFT** to (5, 8), the distance increases to 3, but I am still applying pressure from the right side, forcing them further into the open board where they can't hide.\n\n**STRATEGIC REASONING:**\n1.  **Aggression:** I have the lead (6-4). I cannot let them breathe. Moving **LEFT** cuts off their potential escape route to the right side. The right side is MY territory.\n2.  **Positioning:** By moving **LEFT** to (8, 7), I am positioning myself to intercept them if they try to loop around the top or bottom. I am also clearing my vertical column (9,7) so I have flexibility later.\n3.  **Safety:** (8, 7) is empty. My body is to the right and below. The enemy is to the left. I am safe.\n4.  **Long Term:** I want to keep them pinned against the left wall or force a head-on collision where I have the HP advantage. Moving left is the direct path to the kill zone.\n\n**CHAT, THEY ARE FLEEING, BUT I AM HUNTING! GOING LEFT TO CLOSE THE DISTANCE!**\n\nLEFT",

Illegal/backwards. DEAD if we try. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (6,9) = legal. Moves us to the top row, keeps 2\u20133 follow-ups (L/R mostly). Positions us to contest the top corridor. \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8) = legal. Keeps mobility but drifts away from the opponent\u2019s flank. \u2705 (more conservative)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7) = legal. Gets us lower, closer to central apples, but not directly threatening the enemy currently. \u2705\n\nEnemy read (Snake 0 at (9,7), neck at (9,6)):\n- RIGHT = off-board (illegal).\n- DOWN = into their neck (illegal).\n- LEFT = (8,7) is our body \u2014 that would be suicide into us.\nThey are essentially forced to go UP to (9,8) this turn. They\u2019ll then be climbing the right wall. We WIN by corralling them up that wall and sealing their escape later.\n\nStrategic choice:\n- We are down 4 \u2192 6 apples. Head-on equals predictable DOUBLE-KO loss (they have more apples). So NO suicidal head trades.\n- We want to race to the top-right corridor and claim the high ground / the apple at (8,9) so we can block their retreat into (9,9)/(9,8). That means getting onto the top row quickly and then strafing right.\n- UP (to 6,9) is the fastest, most aggressive play to seize the top lane and set up a cut-off. LEFT is safer but slower for the trap; DOWN is off-angle and less useful.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Turn 16: go UP to (6,9). Expect enemy to move to (9,8).\n- Turn 17\u201318: push RIGHT along top row to contest (7,9) \u2192 (8,9) (apple) \u2192 then pressure (9,9) to close their escape route as they climb. Don\u2019t head-on; only force collisions if we out-apple them.\n- Keep an eye on our tail clearing (8,7/8,8) so we know when their LEFT moves become available \u2014 we want them to be boxed into the top/right before their left option opens.\n\nWe\u2019re grabbing the high ground and setting the trap. Stay mobile, don\u2019t trade heads while down on apples.\n\nUP",
