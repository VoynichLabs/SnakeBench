Go LEFT toward the apple at (3, 2) - I can reach it in 3 moves\n\nSince the enemy moved away from (5, 3), going UP seems like the better choice.

          "move": "LEFT",
          "rationale": "Looking at the current board state:\n\nMy snake (ID 0) is at position (3, 3) with body at [(4, 3), (5, 3)]. I successfully moved LEFT from my previous position and I'm now just 1 move away from the apple at (2, 3)!\n\nEnemy snake (ID 1) is at position (5, 9) with no body segments, so they're still far from me and not an immediate threat.\n\nCurrent apples remaining: (3, 2), (4, 7), (0, 9), (2, 3), (2, 8)\n\nLet me analyze my possible moves from (3, 3):\n- UP: Would move me to (3, 4) - safe, empty space\n- DOWN: Would move me to (3, 2) - this has an apple! That's also a good option\n- LEFT: Would move me to (2, 3) - this has an apple! This was my original target\n- RIGHT: Would move me to (4, 3) - this would hit my own body segment - DEATH\n\nSo RIGHT is definitely out.\n\nI have two great options - I can get an apple by going either LEFT to (2, 3) or DOWN to (3, 2). Both are equally close and both give me a point.\n\nLet me think strategically:\n- If I go LEFT to (2, 3), after eating that apple I'll be at (2, 3) and the apple at (3, 2) will still be very close (just 1 move DOWN and 1 move RIGHT).\n- If I go DOWN to (3, 2), after eating that apple I'll be at (3, 2) and the apple at (2, 3) will still be close (just 1 move LEFT).\n\nBoth seem equally good, but I'll stick with my original plan since LEFT to (2, 3) was my target. This also positions me well for potentially going after the apple at (0, 9) later if needed, though that's quite far.\n\nThe enemy snake is still very far away at (5, 9), so I'm not worried about competition for these nearby apples yet.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating the apple at (2, 3), I should immediately go for the apple at (3, 2) since it will be very close. Then I can assess whether to go for (4, 7) or other remaining apples based on where the enemy snake moves.\n\nLEFT"
