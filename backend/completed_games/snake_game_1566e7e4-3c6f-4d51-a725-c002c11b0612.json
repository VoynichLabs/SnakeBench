I see that there are apples at (8, 7), (7, 4), (2, 0), (1, 3), and (5, 2). \n\nMy first priority is to get closer to the apples. I see that the closest apple to me is at (2, 0), but it's a bit far. I also see that there's an apple at (1, 3), but it's also a bit far. However, I notice that there's an apple at (5, 2) which is relatively close to me.\n\nI also need to be aware of the enemy snake #2, which is at position (1, 9). I don't see its body, so I'm not sure how long it is, but I'll need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the apple at (5, 2) and try to get closer to it. I'll also keep an eye on the enemy snake and try to avoid it.\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (5, 2), I need to move up and to the right. Since I'm currently at (0, 9), I can move up to (0, 8) and then move right to (1, 8), but that would put me in the same column as the enemy snake. So, I'll move up to (0, 8) and then move right to (1, 8) is not the best option. \n\nA better option is to move up to (0, 8) and then move right to (1, 8) is not the best option. A better option is to move right to (1, 9) is not an option because it's the enemy snake's position. A better option is to move right to (1, 8) is not the best option.
