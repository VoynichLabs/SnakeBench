Let's analyze this situation!\n\n**Current Board Analysis:**\n- I'm at (1,1) with my head, and Snake #0 is at (1,3)\n- We're separated by one space vertically - I could move UP to (1,2) and be right next to his head\n- The board is pretty open, lots of space to maneuver\n- Apples are scattered but we're not here for the apples right now - we're here to BOX HIM IN!\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\nWe're in a perfect position to start pressuring him! He's at (1,3) and I'm at (1,1). If I move UP to (1,2), I'll be right next to his head. From there, I can start cutting off his escape routes.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n- UP: Move to (1,2) - this puts me right next to his head at (1,3). Perfect positioning to start boxing him in!\n- DOWN: Move to (1,0) - backing away, losing pressure\n- LEFT: Move to (0,1) - opens up space but loses direct pressure\n- RIGHT: Move to (2,1) - opens up space but loses direct pressure\n\nUP gives me the best position to start applying pressure and force him into a bad move. I want to get aggressive and start cutting off his options!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're setting up to box him in from the side. Once we're at (1,2), we can start moving laterally to cut off his escape routes. Watch where he moves - if he goes LEFT or RIGHT, we follow and keep the pressure. If he goes DOWN, we might have a head-on collision opportunity if we have more apples!\n\nUP",

Let me break this down!\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n- I'm at (2,3) with 0 apples, Snake #0 is at (2,6) with 2 apples - he's ahead, gotta be careful about head-on collisions!\n- My head is at (2,3), and there's an apple at (2,7) - that's 4 spaces UP!

Once we're at (1,4) or (1,5), we can decide whether to go RIGHT toward the apple or continue building our own vertical path.
