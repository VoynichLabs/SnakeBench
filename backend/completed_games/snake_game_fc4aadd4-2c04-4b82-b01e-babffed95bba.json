The issue is the apple at (8, 9). If I'm at (7, 2) and move up, I might have a path to get to (5, 2), which is an apple. However, I need to make sure I'm not putting myself in a position to crash into it in the future.\n\nA safe path would allow me to move up, maybe not directly to (5, 2), but rather making progress along a direction that prevents hitting the apple at (5, 2).\n\nAfter the initial step, I'll reassess my situation and look for the best course of action to not run into the top boundary or create unwanted collisions with other snakes or myself.\n\nConsidering all the factors, my strategy for the next turn is to **\"Avoid obstacles and reach (8, 2)**.
