The board is 8x8.\n\nApples are abundant.\nClosest apples to my snake (1, 6):\n(0, 6) - Left, distance 1\n(1, 7) - Up, distance 1\n\nOther nearby apples:\n(0, 7) - Left, Up, distance 2\n(2, 7) - Right, Up, distance 2\n(1, 5) - Down, distance 1 (Note: This is also near Snake 0)\n\nClosest apples to Snake 0 (1, 4):\n(1, 5) - Up, distance 1\n(0, 4) - Left, distance 1 (There is no apple at (0, 4) according to the list.

UP to (1, 7): Hits apple. Safe.\n2. DOWN to (1, 5): Hits apple. Safe. This tile (1, 5) is also 1 move away from Snake 0's head (1, 4). If both snakes go to (1, 5), it's a head-on collision.\n3. LEFT to (0, 6): Hits apple. Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (2, 6): Empty. Safe.\n\nEvaluating enemy moves for Snake 0 (1, 4):\n1. UP to (1, 5): Hits apple. This is dangerous for me if I choose DOWN.\n2. DOWN to (1, 3): Empty. Safe.\n3. LEFT to (0, 4): Empty. Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (2, 4): Empty. Safe.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 7), I get an apple and move away from Snake 0.\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 6), I get an apple and move away from Snake 0.\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 5), I get an apple, but Snake 0 might move UP to (1, 5). If Snake 0 moves UP and I move DOWN, we collide and both die. Given it's an immediate apple for Snake 0, it's highly likely they will try to move UP. So DOWN is risky and should be avoided.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, both secure an apple safely on Turn 1.\n\n*   If I go UP to (1, 7): I secure (1, 7). Snake 0 is still far. My next available apples are (0, 7) (1 move) or (4, 7) (3 moves).\n    *   If Snake 0 goes UP to (1, 5), they secure (1, 5).\n*   If I go LEFT to (0, 6): I secure (0, 6). Snake 0 is still far. My next available apples are (0, 7) (1 move) or (0, 0) (6 moves).\n    *   If Snake 0 goes UP to (1, 5), they secure (1, 5).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT seem equally good in terms of immediate gain and safety.\n\nLet's look at long-term positioning.\nMoving UP puts me on the top edge. I have (0, 7) one move away (LEFT), and (4, 7) relatively far (3 moves RIGHT).\nMoving LEFT puts me on the left edge. I have (0, 7) one move away (UP), and (0, 0) relatively far (6 moves DOWN).\n\nThe abundance of apples suggests aggressive apple collection is paramount, and avoiding the enemy is secondary only to staying alive. Since both UP and LEFT are safe and grant an apple, I'll pick one that keeps me exploring new territory easily.\n\nIf I choose UP (1, 7):\nNext apples: (0, 7) LEFT, (4, 7) RIGHT.\n\nIf I choose LEFT (0, 6):\nNext apples: (0, 7) UP, (0, 0) DOWN.\n\nMoving UP seems slightly better as it positions me to potentially intercept the (4, 7) apple if Snake 0 ignores the upper right quadrant. It also gives me easy access to (0, 7).\n\nI will choose UP.\n\n**Revisiting risk of collision:** The only theoretical immediate danger is if I move DOWN. Since I am choosing UP, I am moving away from Snake 0, who is at (1, 4). There is no risk of collision on this turn.\n\nUP\nIf I take (1, 7), I'll have 1 apple.\nIf Snake 0 takes (1, 5), they'll have 1 apple.\n\nPlan for next turn (if successful UP move): From (1, 7), look to move LEFT to (0, 7) for another apple, or potentially RIGHT to (2, 7) or further towards (4, 7). Keeping options open along the top boundary.\n\nUP",

It keeps multiple escape options (up, down, right next turn) and avoids contesting the immediate apple where a head-on is possible.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- From (2,4) prioritise the apple at (3,4) then branch toward the cluster around (4,3)/(4,5)/(5,5).\n- Avoid moving into cells that could be contested by the enemy head when they are adjacent; prefer routes that maintain at least two exit choices.\n- If the enemy goes for top apples, take bottom/center cluster and try to collect several safely.\n\nRIGHT",

I seem to have made a mistake in the previous rationale analysis regarding the initial (1, 7) apple location, but regardless, the current state shows 1 at (1, 7) and T at (1, 6).) Wait, the game state provided shows: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (1, 7), Body: [(1, 6)], Apples collected: 1\". This means the move UP was successful, the (1, 7) cell was eaten, and the snake grew. The list of Apples provided above IS the list of *remaining* apples.\n\nApples bordering (1, 7) (My Head):\n1. UP (1, 8) - OUT OF BOUNDS.\n2. DOWN (1, 6) - My body/tail (T). Moving here is moving backwards into the body (lethal if the body segment is the one immediately behind the head). Since the body is only 1 segment long at (1, 6), I cannot move DOWN.\n\n3.

Puts distance between me and Snake 0's predicted path (Right side of board).\nCon: Corner restricts movement. If I move to (0, 7), my next move must be DOWN to (0, 6) to avoid wall (0, 8) and body (1, 7 - this cell will be empty or a body segment depending on growth).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 7):\nPro: Keeps me on the top edge, positioned towards (4, 7) (2 moves away: R, R). Also 1 move away from (3, 6) (Down 1, Right 1 - 2 moves total).\nCon: Moves towards the center/right side of the board where Snake 0 is establishing control (if they take (3, 4)).\n\nLet's evaluate reaching apples next turn (Turn 2):\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT (0, 7).\nTurn 2 from (0, 7):\n1. DOWN to (0, 6) (Apple) - Safe and gets an apple.\n2. UP (0, 8) - Wall (Death).\n3. LEFT (-1, 7) - Wall (Death).\n4. RIGHT to (1, 7) - Previously my head, now empty/body segment. Since I grew on Turn 0, my body at (1, 6) remains stationary for Turn 1. The cell (1, 7) becomes empty. Safe, but doesn't get apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I secure an apple on T+1 (Turn 2). This is good.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT (2, 7).\nTurn 2 from (2, 7):\n1. UP (2, 8) - Wall (Death).\n2. DOWN to (2, 6) - Empty.\n3. LEFT to (1, 7) - Empty.\n4. RIGHT to (3, 7) - Empty.\nI would need two more moves to reach (4, 7) or one move and then another to reach (3, 6).\n* (4, 7): R -> (3, 7) -> R -> (4, 7) [Apple] (T+2 is (3, 7), T+3 is (4, 7)).\n* (3, 6): D -> (2, 6) -> R -> (3, 6) [Apple] (T+2 is (2, 6), T+3 is (3, 6)).\n\nMoving LEFT guarantees an apple sooner (T+1) and moves me away from the enemy's likely expansion zone. Although it corners me momentarily, the apple (0, 6) keeps my options open after consumption, as my tail (1, 6) will free up.\n\nLet's confirm no immediate danger from Enemy 0 (2, 4).\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (3, 4), they are far down and right. No collision possible.\n\nIf I choose LEFT:\nMy next position: (0, 7). My body shortens / shifts to [(1, 7)]. Wait, I collected an apple on Turn 0, so I grew.\nT0 Head: (1, 6). Body: none.\nT0 Move: UP.\nT1 Head: (1, 7). Body sequence: [(1, 6)]. Previous tail segment is (1, 6).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 7) (T1):\nNew Head: (0, 7). New Body sequence: [(1, 7), (1, 6)]. Length remains 2 since no apple was eaten this turn, the body shifts. The old tail (1, 6) becomes empty.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 6) (T2):\nNew Head: (0, 6) [Apple eaten, Length 3]. New Body sequence: [(0, 7), (1, 7)]. The old tail (1, 6) remains empty.\n\nThis seems like the best strategy: secure the next closest apple safely.\n\nStrategic Choice: LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan: Clear the perimeter apples (0, 6), (0, 0) and then move towards the center/right side.\n\nFinal check for safety:\nHead (1, 7). Moving LEFT to (0, 7).\n1. Wall collision? No, (0, 7) is on board.\n2. Self-collision? No, (0, 7) is not (1, 6) (tail) or (1, 7) (head).\n3. Enemy collision? Snake 0 is at (2, 4). Moving to (0, 7) is extremely far from Snake 0's possible moves (2, 5), (2, 3), (1, 4), (3, 4). No collision risk.\n\nLEFT",

If Head is (0, 7) and Body is [(1, 7)], then (1, 7) is the segment directly behind the head. The previous tail was (1, 6). Since I moved LEFT from (1, 7) to (0, 7) and did NOT eat an apple, my body shifts: (1, 7) is now the body segment, and (1, 6) is now empty. The visualization shows T at (1, 7), which is correct for the immediate segment behind the head in a length 2 snake that has just moved without eating.\n\nLet's re-verify Snake 0 state: Head (3, 4), Body [(2, 4)], Apples: 1. This means Snake 0 started at (2, 4) (length 1), moved to (3, 4) (an apple), and grew. Its new body length is 2. The visualization shows 0 at (3, 4) and T at (2, 4).

Moving here is moving backwards into the body (lethal). DEATH.\n\nWait, if my body is only one segment long at (1, 7), moving RIGHT (backwards) is lethal.\nRule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n(1, 7) is the cell directly behind my head (0, 7). Moving RIGHT is moving to (1, 7). This is self-collision.\n\nOnly one safe move remains: DOWN to (0, 6).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 6):\nPros: I eat an apple, increase my length to 3, increase my score 1 point. I break out of the immediate corner entrapment (as my body will now be (0, 7) -> (1, 7), and the cell (1, 6) will be irrelevant but free).\nCons: None, it's the only safe move!\n\nLet's predict what Snake 0 might do:\nHead (3, 4). Closest apples:\n(3, 6): Distance 2 (Up 2).\n(4, 5): Distance 2 (Right 1, Up 1).\n(4, 3): Distance 2 (Right 1, Down 1).\n(3, 2): Distance 2 (Down 2).\n(2, 2): Distance 2 (Left 1, Down 2).\n(1, 5): Distance 2 (Left 2, Up 1).\n\nSafe moves for Snake 0 from (3, 4). Body segment T at (2, 4). Cannot move LEFT.\n1. UP (3, 5): Empty.\n2. DOWN (3, 3): Empty.\n3. RIGHT (4, 4): Empty.\n\nSnake 0 is likely aiming for a nearby apple. (3, 6) or (4, 5) or (4, 3) or (3, 2).\nIf aiming for (3, 6) it would move UP to (3, 5), then UP to (3, 6) (Apple).\nIf aiming for (4, 5) it could move UP to (3, 5), then RIGHT to (4, 5) (Apple).\nIf aiming for (4, 3) it could move RIGHT to (4, 4), then DOWN to (4, 3) (Apple).\n\nSnake 0 doesn't have an immediate apple capture. They will likely move UP to (3, 5) to progress towards the upper set of apples, or RIGHT to (4, 4) to progress towards the center set.\nWhether they move UP or RIGHT, they are far away and pose no threat this turn.\n\nConclusion: My only safe move is DOWN, and it results in gaining an apple.\n\nDOWN",

HIGH PRIORITY.\n\nSnake 0 has two immediate apple captures: (3, 2) [D] and (4, 3) [R].\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (3, 2), they pick up the apple and their body becomes (3, 3) -> (3, 4).\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (4, 3), they pick up the apple and their body becomes (3, 3) -> (3, 4).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves, they will likely choose one of these two moves.\nIf 0 moves RIGHT to (4, 3), they move towards the center/right.\nIf 0 moves DOWN to (3, 2), they move towards the bottom center.\n\nNeither of these moves interferes with my decision to move RIGHT or DOWN, as I am far up in the (0, X) columns.\n\nStrategy: Since (1, 5) is the closest available apple, I should prioritize setting up for that capture on Turn 4, and moving RIGHT to (1, 6) provides better spatial freedom than moving DOWN to (0, 5), which keeps me boxed along the wall.\n\nMove RIGHT to (1, 6). Next turn, I will move DOWN to (1, 5) and eat an apple.\n\nRIGHT",

(I moved RIGHT from (0, 6) to (1, 6)).\nEnemy snake (ID 0) Head: (4, 3). Body: [(3, 3), (3, 4)]. Length: 3. (Snake 0 moved from (3, 3) to (4, 3) and ate an apple at (4, 3). Since its length is 3 now, its body must have retained the tail position).\n\nLet's confirm Snake 0's move and length.\nTurn 3 state: Head (3, 3), Body [(3, 4)]. Length 2. Score 2.\nTurn 4 state: Head (4, 3), Body [(3, 3), (3, 4)]. Length 3. Score 3.\nThe APPLE list for Turn 3 included (4, 3). So Snake 0 moved from (3, 3) to (4, 3), ate an apple, and grew. This is consistent with the provided data. Score 0 is now 3. My score is 2. (Wait, the data says Score 0 apples: 2, but based on the length 3 and previous position (3, 3), it must have eaten (4, 3) and grown. I will stick to the provided length and coordinates.)\n\n*Correction on Scores:* The provided scores show my apples: 2, Snake #0 apples: 2.\nIf Snake 0's current body is [(3, 3), (3, 4)] and its head is (4, 3), its length is 3. If it had length 2 (Head (3, 3), Body (3, 4)) on Turn 3, and is now length 3, it *must* have eaten an apple this turn. This means the overall score count *must* be 3 for Snake 0. I will proceed assuming the coordinate/length information is correct, even if the static score list above is lagging or based on Turn 3's end. For decision-making, I use the current spatial state: Snake 0 is length 3.\n\nApples available: (4, 7), (2, 2), (5, 5), (2, 0), (5, 0), (5, 3), (0, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (3, 6), (7, 2), (0, 2), (2, 5).\n\nBoard visualization:\n 7 T . . .

(Note: (3, 4) is not visible on the board state visualization which has 'T' at (3, 4) from the previous turn, but the current state is 0 at (4, 3), T at (3, 3) and the tail segment (3, 4) is now free IF it didn't eat. Since length is 3, (3, 4) must still be occupied by the tail.)\n\nLet's re-examine the cell occupations based on current state:\nSnake 1: (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7)\nSnake 0: (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)\n\nOccupied cells by snakes:\n(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4).\n\nMy Head (1, 6).\nAvailable safe moves from (1, 6):\n1. UP (1, 7): Empty cell. Safe.\n2. DOWN (1, 5): APPLE (1, 5). HIGH PRIORITY.\n3. LEFT (0, 6): My body segment. DEATH (moving backwards into my own segment).\n4. RIGHT (2, 6): Empty cell. Safe.\n\nI have three safe moves.\n\n**Option 1: DOWN to (1, 5) (Apple)**\nThis is an immediate apple capture.\nNew head: (1, 5). Length becomes 4.\nThis is the optimal move unless it leads to immediate future danger.\n- Pros: Gain an apple, increase length, maintain distance from enemy.\n- Cons: None immediately apparent.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (2, 6)**\nMoves towards apple (3, 6).\nDistance to (3, 6) is R 1. If I move R, I can move R again next turn to eat (3, 6).\nIf I move down and eat (1, 5), I am closer to (2, 5) (apple, D 0, R 1).\n\n**Option 3: UP to (1, 7)**\nMoves further into the upper boundary. Not ideal compared to apple opportunities.\n\nComparing Option 1 (DOWN) and Option 2 (RIGHT):\nMoving DOWN to (1, 5) secures an apple immediately.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 6), I delay eating the apple at (1, 5) and allow some other snake (if there were more, but there is only one other snake far away) to potentially get it, or I might get distracted.\n\nLet's check Snake 0: Head (4, 3). Body [(3, 3), (3, 4)].\nPossible safe moves for Snake 0:\n1. UP (4, 4): Empty. Safe.\n2. DOWN (4, 2): Empty. Safe.\n3. LEFT (3, 3): Body segment. DEATH.\n4. RIGHT (5, 3): APPLE (5, 3). HIGH PRIORITY.\n\nSnake 0 will almost certainly move RIGHT to (5, 3) to claim another apple. This does not pose any collision risk for my move DOWN to (1, 5). Snake 0 is operating in the lower-right quadrant, I am in the upper-left.\n\nMy plan remains simple: maximize apple acquisition safely. Moving DOWN to (1, 5) is the best choice.\n\nFuture planning (Turn 5 onwards):\nAfter moving DOWN to (1, 5), my body is (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7). Length 4.\nFrom (1, 5), I have several options:\n1. UP (1, 6): Body segment. DEATH.\n2. DOWN (1, 4): Empty.\n3. LEFT (0, 5): Empty.\n4. RIGHT (2, 5): APPLE (2, 5). Distance 1.\n\nIf I survive this move (which seems highly likely), my next move will be RIGHT to (2, 5) to grab another apple. This moves me towards the densely packed apples in the (2, X) column (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0) and (3, 6) is also reachable eventually.\n\nConfirming non-lethal move:\n(1, 6) -> DOWN -> (1, 5).\n(1, 5) is an apple cell, not occupied by any snake body or head, and not off-board. Safe.\n\nDOWN",

Length 5.\nFrom (2, 5), my immediate targets are:\n1. (3, 6) - Up/Right movement.\n2. (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0) - Down movement.\n3. (3, 2) - Down/Right movement.\n\nI should prioritize consolidating the apple cluster below me. From (2, 5):\n- UP (2, 6): Empty.\n- DOWN (2, 4): Empty. Next move to (2, 3), then (2, 2) (Apple).\n- LEFT (1, 5): Body. DEATH.\n- RIGHT (3, 5): Apple at (4, 5) is nearby.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 4), I position myself for (2, 2) and the other apples in column 2. This looks like the best path toward quick resource gain.\n\nThe current move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT (1, 5): My body segment. DEATH. (Directly backwards)\n4. RIGHT (3, 5): Empty cell. Safe. Towards (4, 5) apple or (3, 6) apple.\n\nAll moves except LEFT are immediately safe.

Best achieved by moving DOWN.\n* (3, 6) is 2 units away (UP, RIGHT or RIGHT, UP)\n* (4, 5) is 2 units away (RIGHT, RIGHT)\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n**Option 1: DOWN to (2, 4)**\n* Pros: Places me directly in the path of the dense column 2 apples (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0).\n* Cons: Moves me slightly away from Snake 0, but Snake 0 is far away and currently aiming for the middle/top right section. No immediate collision risk. This path might limit horizontal movement later if I go too far down into the corner (2, 0), but for now, it's open.\n\n**Option 2: UP to (2, 6)**\n* Pros: Positions me for apple (3, 6).\n* Cons: Moving away from the dense cluster below.\n\n**Option 3: RIGHT to (3, 5)**\n* Pros: Positions me for apple (4, 5) or (3, 6). This is a good intermediate position.\n* Cons: (4, 5) is relatively close to Snake 0 (Head at (5, 4)). If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (4, 4) and then UP/RIGHT, we could approach each other.\n\n**Enemy Snake 0 position and projected movement from (5, 4):**\nSnake 0 Head: (5, 4). Body segments: (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3).\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n1. UP (5, 5): Apple! High priority target.\n2. DOWN (5, 3): Body segment. DEATH.\n3. LEFT (4, 4): Empty. Towards apple (4, 5).\n4. RIGHT (6, 4): Empty. Towards apple (7, 2).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (5, 5) (most likely), it eats an apple. New Head: (5, 5). Length 5.\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (4, 4), it positions for (4, 5).\n\nSince I am focused on the left half of the board (Column 2 cluster), and Snake 0 is focused on column 5/6, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (2, 4) enables the quickest path to multiple apples (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0). This allows for rapid growth and resource accumulation where the enemy snake is not currently competing.\n\nIf I move DOWN: New Head (2, 4). My body remains long, extending up to (0, 7).\n\nLet's confirm the safety of DOWN: (2, 4) is empty.\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 7 onwards):**\nIf I move DOWN (2, 4):\nNext turn, I will likely target (2, 3) (empty) and then (2, 2) (Apple).\nFrom (2, 4), safe moves are: UP (body), DOWN (empty), LEFT (empty to (1, 4)), RIGHT (empty to (3, 4)). Good mobility.\n\nThis is the strongest move to secure my leading position by capitalizing on a local apple cluster.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT (3, 3): Enemy Snake 0's tail segment.\n\nLet's analyze RIGHT (3, 3): (3, 3) is the current tail position of Snake 0. Since Snake 0 is 6 units long, if Snake 0 moves without eating, (3, 3) becomes empty. If Snake 0 eats, (3, 3) remains occupied.\nThe position (3, 3) is marked 'T' (tail) in the provided board state snippet, confirming it is Snake 0's tail:\n```\n 3 . . 1 T T T A .\n```\nMy head is at (2, 3). Moving RIGHT to (3, 3) is risky because if Snake 0 does not move away from (3, 3) (i.e., if Snake 0 eats an apple), I would hit the tail and die. Since I have a superb move (DOWN to (2, 2) for an apple), I must not risk a move toward Snake 0's tail unless absolutely necessary.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n**Option 1: DOWN to (2, 2) (Apple)**\n* Pros: Eat an apple, score 5-5 tie, grow to length 6. Next available apples in the column are (2, 1) and (2, 0). Excellent progress.\n* Cons: None.\n\n**Option 2: LEFT to (1, 3)**\n* Pros: Safe. Could target (0, 4) or (0, 2).\n* Cons: Moves away from the immediate apple (2, 2). Losing momentum on clearing the cluster.\n\nDOWN is the clear best move.\n\n**Enemy Snake 0 position and projected movement from (4, 5):**\nSnake 0 must decide whether to move:\n1. UP (4, 6): Empty. Towards (3, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7).\n2. DOWN (4, 4): Empty. Towards center/lower area.\n3. LEFT (3, 5): Empty. Towards (3, 6) or (0, 5).\n4. RIGHT (5, 5): Body segment. DEATH.\n\nSnake 0 is well-positioned for several apples: (3, 6) is 2 moves away (e.g., UP, LEFT or LEFT, UP). (4, 7) is 2 moves away (UP, UP). (5, 7) is 3 moves away.\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (4, 6), (3, 3) becomes empty.\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (4, 4), (3, 3) becomes empty.\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (3, 5), (3, 3) becomes empty.\n\nWhatever Snake 0 does, it doesn't directly interfere with my move DOWN to (2, 2). The collision risk is minimal because I am focused entirely on the empty apple cell.\n\n**Decision:**\nI move DOWN to eat the apple at (2, 2).\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 9 onwards):**\nIf I move DOWN (2, 2) and eat: New head (2, 2), Length 6.\nTurn 9: Move DOWN to (2, 1) (Apple).\nTurn 10: Move DOWN to (2, 0) (Apple).\nThis secures 3 apples in a row quickly and keeps my score ahead or tied with Snake 0.\n\nDOWN",

My goal is to secure the remaining apples in column 2: (2, 1) and (2, 0). (2, 1) is an apple and 1 move away.**\n\nPossible moves from (2, 2):\n1. UP (2, 3): My body segment. DEATH. (This was my previous head location).\n2. DOWN (2, 1): Apple! This is a high-priority move.\n3. LEFT (1, 2): Empty cell. Safe.\n4. RIGHT (3, 2): Apple! This is also 1 move away.\n\nLet's evaluate the options. I have two immediate apples.\n\n**Option 1: DOWN to (2, 1) (Apple)**\n* Pros: Eat an apple, score 6-5 lead, grow to length 7. Continues clearing the column 2 vertical path, leading easily to (2, 0).\n* Cons: None regarding safety.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (3, 2) (Apple)**\n* Pros: Eat an apple, score 6-5 lead, grow to length 7.\n* Cons: Breaks the vertical path clearing. (3, 2) leads towards a relatively open area but might disrupt my plan to quickly grab (2, 0).\n\nBoth moves are excellent and safe. I must choose which sequence is better.\n\nIf I go DOWN, my expected path is: (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 0) (3 apples total).\nIf I go RIGHT, my expected path is: (2, 2) -> (3, 2). Then I would likely try to get (2, 1) and (2, 0), but it would take 2 moves (LEFT, DOWN) to get to (2, 1) instead of 1.\n\nThe vertical approach (DOWN) is more efficient for clustering apples and keeps my head away from the centralized action of Snake 0.\n\n**Snake 0 Movement Analysis:**\nSnake 0 Head is at (4, 6). Snake 0 is long (6 segments).\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n1. UP (4, 7): Apple! High likelihood.\n2. DOWN (4, 5): Snake 0's body segment. DEATH.\n3. LEFT (3, 6): Apple! High likelihood.\n4. RIGHT (5, 6): Empty cell. Safe.\n\nIf Snake 0 goes UP to (4, 7), it eats an apple (6-5 score lead).\nIf Snake 0 goes LEFT to (3, 6), it eats an apple (6-5 score lead).\n\nSince Snake 0 has two immediate apples, it is very likely to score 1 point this turn, regardless of my movement. If Snake 0 eats, scores will remain tied 6-6 if I also eat.\n\nMy move: DOWN to (2, 1) is secure, targets the most efficient cluster of apples, and ensures I am maximizing my scoring regardless of Snake 0's action.\n\n**Considering collisions:**\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 1), the nearest potential collision point is with Snake 0's future position. Snake 0 is far away (4 units distance) and moving away/laterally in the higher end of the board. No collision risk.\n\nIf I moved RIGHT to (3, 2), I would be closer to potential interaction, but Snake 0 is still far.\n\nI stick to the most efficient apple collection path.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Turn 10 onwards):**\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 1) and eat: New head (2, 1), Length 7. Score 6.\nTurn 10: Move DOWN to (2, 0) (Apple). Score 7.\nAfter (2, 0), I will target the cluster of apples in column 0: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), etc.\n\nThis secures 3 apples in 3 turns (2, 2 -> 2, 1 -> 2, 0) and maintains offensive momentum in the lower left quadrant.\n\nDOWN",

Snake 0 moved from (4, 6) to (3, 6).

My immediate goal is the apple at (2, 0) and then clearing column 0.**\n\nPossible moves from (2, 1):\n1. UP (2, 2): My body segment. DEATH. (Directly behind the head).\n2. DOWN (2, 0): Apple! Excellent move, continuing the planned sequence.\n3. LEFT (1, 1): Empty cell. Safe.\n4. RIGHT (3, 1): Empty cell. Safe.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n**Option 1: DOWN to (2, 0) (Apple)**\n* Pros: Eat an apple, score 7-6 lead, grow to length 8. Highly efficient and part of the cluster clearing strategy.\n* Cons: None. Safest and highest reward.\n\n**Option 2: LEFT to (1, 1) (Empty)**\n* Pros: Safe, potentially positioning for apples in column 0: (0, 0), (0, 1).\n* Cons: Misses an immediate apple. Gives snake 0 a turn to catch up or take another apple.\n\n**Option 3: RIGHT to (3, 1) (Empty)**\n* Pros: Safe.\n* Cons: Moves away from the planned apple cluster (2, 0) and (0, *).\n\nThe optimal move is clearly DOWN to (2, 0).\n\n**Enemy Snake 0 Analysis:**\nSnake 0 Head is at (3, 6).\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (avoiding (4, 6) which is its body):\n1. UP (3, 7): Empty space. Safe.\n2. DOWN (3, 5): Empty space. Safe.\n3. LEFT (2, 6): Empty space. Safe. (Leads toward my snake's territory but far).\n4. RIGHT (4, 6): Body segment. DEATH.\n\nImmediate apples for Snake 0 (1 move away):\n* (4, 7) - Requires 2 moves (UP, RIGHT or RIGHT, UP)\n* (5, 7) - Requires 2 moves\n* (5, 6) - Requires 2 moves\n\nSnake 0 seems to be blocked from immediate apples and might focus on moving towards (4, 7) or (5, 7).\nIf S0 goes UP to (3, 7), it positions itself well for (4, 7).\nIf S0 goes DOWN to (3, 5), it is moving away from the top apples.\nIf S0 goes LEFT to (2, 6), it is moving towards my tail/body (1, 6) and (2, 5).\n\nSince Snake 0 is not guaranteed to eat this turn, moving DOWN to (2, 0) ensures I take the lead 7-6.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nMy move: (2, 1) -> (2, 0).\nSnake 0 is far away at (3, 6). No risk of collision.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Turn 11 onwards):**\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 0) and eat: New head (2, 0), Length 8. Score 7.\nNext turn (Turn 11), my head is at (2, 0). I will move LEFT to (1, 0) or UP to (0, 0) if I can safely reach the column 0 apples: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5).\n\nFrom (2, 0), I have options:\n1. UP (2, 1): My body segment. DEATH.\n2. DOWN (2, -1): Off board. DEATH.\n3. LEFT (1, 0): Empty. Safe.\n4. RIGHT (3, 0): Apple (5, 0) is nearby, but (3, 0) is empty. Not optimal.\n\nMy strategy will be to move LEFT to (1, 0), then LEFT again to (0, 0) (Apple). Or, potentially move towards (0, 1) and (0, 2) first. (0, 0) is a crucial apple. Reaching (0, 0) (Apple) from (2, 0) takes 2 moves (LEFT to 1, 0; LEFT to 0, 0).\n\nThe current move is unequivocally DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

If A are apples, this diagram is misleading or confusing.)\n    Let's rely strictly on the provided coordinates of apples, snakes, and the head position.\n\nSnake locations:\nS1 (Me): (2, 0) H, (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6) T.\nS0 (Enemy): (3, 7) H, (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3) T.\n\n**Apple locations near me (2, 0):**\n* (0, 0): 2 moves (LEFT, LEFT)\n* (5, 0): 3 moves (RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT or RIGHT, UP, RIGHT)\n* (0, 1): 2 moves (LEFT, UP or UP, LEFT)\n\nMy current focus is clustering apples in column 0: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5).\n\n**Possible moves from (2, 0):**\n1. UP (2, 1): My body segment. DEATH.\n2. DOWN (2, -1): Off board. DEATH.\n3. LEFT (1, 0): Empty cell. Safe. Leads towards (0, 0).\n4. RIGHT (3, 0): Empty cell. Safe. Leads away from column 0 cluster, but possibly towards (5, 0).\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n**Option 1: LEFT to (1, 0)**\n* Pros: Directly positions me for the apple at (0, 0) next turn (if safe). Continues the strategy of clearing the bottom-left corner.\n* Cons: None apparent.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (3, 0)**\n* Cons: Moves away from the primary apple cluster. It might lead to (5, 0) in 2 moves, but securing the column 0 cluster first is strategically better due to the density of apples.\n\n**Enemy Snake 0 Analysis:**\nS0 Head is at (3, 7). S0's tail is at (5, 3).\nImmediate apples for S0: (4, 7) is 1 move away if S0 moves RIGHT. (5, 7) is 2 moves away.\nS0's safe moves from (3, 7):\n1. UP (3, 8): Off board. DEATH.\n2. DOWN (3, 6): Body segment. DEATH. (S0 moved UP last turn, (3,6) is now the new segment behind the head)\n3. LEFT (2, 7): Empty. Safe.\n4. RIGHT (4, 7): Apple! Excellent move for S0.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (4, 7) and eats, its length becomes 8.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nMy move LEFT to (1, 0) is far away from S0 (3, 7). No collision risk.\n\n**Choosing the Best Move:**\nMoving LEFT to (1, 0) perfectly sets up the capture of the apple at (0, 0) on Turn 12. This is the continuation of my highly successful corner-clearing strategy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nT11: Move LEFT to (1, 0).\nT12: Move LEFT to (0, 0) (Apple). Score 8.\nT13: From (0, 0), evaluate moving UP to (0, 1) (Apple) or RIGHT to (1, 0) to swing back. Likely UP.\n\nI should prioritize securing the remaining column 0 apples before S0 gets access to the lower half of the board.\n\nLEFT",

(S0 moved RIGHT from (3, 7) to (4, 7) and ate the apple at (4, 7). This explains why the coordinates changed and S0 grew.)\nBody: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3)] T. (Wait, S0 grew, so the length should be 8. The provided state shows a body of length 7, making total length 8. Let's list the provided body: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3)]. This is 7 segments. Head (4, 7) + Body (7 segments) = Length 8. This is consistent with S0 eating an apple last turn.)\nApples collected: 7.\n\nScores: Me 7, Enemy 7. Tied lead.\n\nBoard size: 8x8 (0-7).\n\nApples available (15 total, a new one must have spawned if my last move statement was correct about 14, and now there are 15):\n(5, 0), (0, 0), (3, 2), (7, 2), (0, 2), (0, 4), (5, 7), (6, 3), (6, 0), (0, 5), (0, 1), (5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 1), (1, 1).\n\n**Snake Locations (Visualization):**\nS1 (Me, Head @ (1, 0)):\n(1, 0) H\n(2, 0)\n(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)\n(1, 5) T\n\nS0 (Enemy, Head @ (4, 7)):\n(4, 7) H\n(3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3) T\n\n**Apples near me (1, 0):**\n* (0, 0): 1 move LEFT (Apple!)\n* (1, 1): 1 move UP (Apple!)\n* (0, 1): 2 moves (LEFT, UP) or (UP, LEFT)\n* (5, 0): 4 moves RIGHT\n\nThe strategy of clearing column 0 is still primary. I have two immediate apple targets: (0, 0) and (1, 1).\n\n**Possible moves from (1, 0):**\n1. UP (1, 1): Apple! Safe. (Leads towards (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5) cluster)\n2. DOWN (1, -1): Off board. DEATH.\n3. LEFT (0, 0): Apple! Safe. (Leads towards (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5) cluster)\n4. RIGHT (2, 0): My body segment. DEATH.\n\nI have two excellent, safe moves that both involve eating an apple: LEFT to (0, 0) or UP to (1, 1).\n\n**Evaluation of Apple Choices:**\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 0) (Apple):\n* New Head: (0, 0).\n* Next targets: (0, 1) or (1, 1). Both 1 move away.\n* This is excellent for maintaining my position in column 0.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 1) (Apple):\n* New Head: (1, 1).\n* Next targets: (0, 1) (1 move LEFT) or (1, 2) (1 move UP). Both are apples.\n* This leaves (0, 0) exposed but allows me to clear the column from the bottom up, which can be logistically easier.\n\nBoth moves secure me an apple and increase my score to 8, taking the lead. Both moves keep me safe and open up multiple apple targets immediately afterward.\n\n**Analyzing the Enemy (S0 Head at (4, 7)):**\nS0 is far away and currently focused on the top right.\nApples near S0: (5, 7) (1 move RIGHT), (6, 3) (4 moves), (5, 6) (2 moves DOWN, LEFT or LEFT, DOWN).\nS0's safe moves from (4, 7):\n1. UP (4, 8): Death (off board).\n2. DOWN (4, 6): Body segment (3rd segment). DEATH.\n3. LEFT (3, 7): Body segment (2nd segment). DEATH.\n4. RIGHT (5, 7): Apple! This is the obvious best move for S0.\n\n*Prediction*: S0 moves RIGHT to (5, 7) and eats an apple, maintaining the tie at 8 apples each.\n\n**Tiebreaker consideration for my move:**\nWhere do I want to be for Turn 13?\n\nCase A: Move LEFT to (0, 0).\nTurn 13 targets: (0, 1) [Apple, UP] or (1, 0) [Empty, RIGHT] or (1, 1) [Apple, Up *and* Right].\nIf I move UP to (0, 1) next turn, I can keep going up the 0 column.\n\nCase B: Move UP to (1, 1).\nTurn 13 targets: (1, 2) [Apple, UP] or (0, 1) [Apple, LEFT] or (2, 1) [Body, no].\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 1) next turn, I am back in column 0.\n\nBoth sequences (0, 0) -> (0, 1) or (1, 1) -> (0, 1) are highly efficient for clearing the core cluster (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5).\n\nGoing LEFT to (0, 0) gives me the best possible position to secure the entire column 0 in rapid succession, minimizing backtracking.\n\nT12: (1, 0) -> (0, 0) [Apple]\nT13: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) [Apple]\nT14: (0, 1) -> (0, 2) [Apple]\nT15: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) [Empty]\nT16: (0, 3) -> (0, 4) [Apple]\nT17: (0, 4) -> (0, 5) [Apple]\n\nThis sequence yields 5 apples in 6 moves, effectively cleaning up the main cluster and greatly extending my snake towards the bottom-left corner, making it harder for S0 to interrupt.\n\nIf I go UP to (1, 1) first, then I must choose between (1, 2) and (0, 1) on T13. If I go (0, 1), then (0, 0) is left exposed and I have to swing back DOWN and LEFT. Sticking hard to column 0 first by moving LEFT seems slightly more efficient.\n\nI choose LEFT to (0, 0).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Secure the cluster of apples in column 0: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5). Then clear the remaining lower apples like (1, 1), (1, 2). This puts pressure on S0 who is currently constrained in the upper right.\n\nLEFT",

The board state still shows 15 apples, meaning two new apples spawned. Let's verify the new list against the old list.\nOld apples (T12): (5, 0), (0, 0), (3, 2), (7, 2), (0, 2), (0, 4), (5, 7), (6, 3), (6, 0), (0, 5), (0, 1), (5, 6), (1, 2), (6, 1), (1, 1).

(15 apples)\n\nApples removed: (0, 0) and (5, 7).\nApples added: (1, 6) and (3, 5). (Yes, 8+1-2+2=9 body segments for both snakes implies 2 apples were eaten and 2 apples spawned). This is consistent.\n\n**Snake Locations (Visualization):**\nID 1 (Me, Head @ (0, 0)): Column 0 is my target.\nID 0 (Enemy, Head @ (5, 7)): Still near the top right, potentially aiming for (5, 6) or (1, 6).\n\n**Apples near me (0, 0):**\n* (0, 1): 1 move UP (Apple!)\n* (1, 1): 2 moves (UP, RIGHT) or (RIGHT, UP) (Apple!)\n* (1, 0): My body segment.\n\nThe strategy of clearing column 0 is still paramount.\n\n**Possible moves from (0, 0):**\n1.

So DOWN forces a constrained but safe next move.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,7) preserves more immediate freedom (can then go DOWN or RIGHT), but forgoes the apple and gives the opponent time to collect apples.\n\nDecision and short-term plan:\n- Take the apple at (5,6) now (DOWN). This increases my apple count and keeps pressure on the opponent.\n- Next turn plan (if still safe): move RIGHT to (6,6) (the only safe follow-up after eating).

Two new apples spawned. Let's assume they spawned at (7, 6) and (1, 3) (checking the provided apple list for T14).\nT14 Apples: (5, 0), (3, 2), (7, 2), (0, 2), (0, 4), (6, 3), (6, 0), (0, 5), (1, 2), (6, 1), (1, 1), (1, 6), (3, 5), (7, 6), (1, 3).

Then I could move UP to (1, 2) (apple) or LEFT to (0, 1) (my own body path).\n\nSince (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5) are clustered apples that form a clear pathway UP, it's safer and less congested to continue UP. (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3) form another cluster, but it's often best to secure the densest current path first.\n\n**Target analysis for UP (0, 2):**\n* New Head: (0, 2).

Length: 10 (likely moved right from (5, 6) to (6, 6) and did not eat an apple).\nBody: [(5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)].\nApples collected: 9.\n\nScores: Me 10, Enemy 9.

The path is safe and dense with apples.\nID 0 (Enemy, Head @ (6, 6)): Near the top right, trying to secure the high-value apples there ((7, 6), (6, 3), etc.)\n\n**Current Goal:** Secure the next available apples in column 0: (0, 4) and (0, 5).\n\n**Possible moves from my current position (0, 2):**\n1. UP (0, 3): Empty space. Safe. Leads directly to apple at (0, 4).\n2. DOWN (0, 1): My body segment (2nd segment). DEATH.\n3. LEFT (-1, 2): Off board. DEATH.\n4. RIGHT (1, 2): Apple at (1, 2). Safe.\n\n**Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:**\nIf I go UP to (0, 3): I maintain the column 0 path, aiming for (0, 4) next, and then (0, 5). This keeps me in a safe, known, and less congested zone. The tail (1, 5) will move to (2, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 2): I eat an apple immediately. Then I might be slightly less optimally positioned for the next move, possibly leading to congestion with the (1, 1) and (1, 3) apples.\n\nSince I have a clear, three-apple path going up (0, 3)->(0, 4)->(0, 5), moving towards (0, 3) (empty space) is strategic now to position myself for the next two apples. If I go RIGHT, I get one apple now, but break the established path. Given the lead and the density of apples UP, positioning for the future seems better.\n\n**Checking the threat posed by S0 (Head at 6, 6):**\nS0 is far away and preoccupied with the right side apples. They are currently not a factor for the left side of the board.\n\nPotential moves for S0 from (6, 6):\n1. UP (6, 7): Empty. Towards T zone wall.\n2. DOWN (6, 5): Empty. Towards (6, 3) or (6, 1).\n3. LEFT (5, 6): Body segment (2nd segment). DEATH.\n4. RIGHT (7, 6): Apple! High probability move.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 6), they secure an apple and grow. This is the optimal move for them.\n\n**Move chosen: UP (0, 2) -> (0, 3)**\nThis move is safe (empty cell). It sets me up perfectly to grab the apple at (0, 4) next turn.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nContinue pursuing the column 0 apples (0, 4), (0, 5). After that, look to sweep inwards to column 1 apples ((1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1)). This keeps a high apple acquisition rate while minimizing interaction with Snake 0 on the crowded right side.\n\nUP",

Length: 11 (Did not eat an apple last turn).\nBody: [(0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)].\nApples collected: 10.\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0) Head is at (7, 6). Length: 10 (Did not eat an apple last turn, their last known location from the last turn's state was (6, 6) and they are now at (7, 6), which is an apple location). Wait, let's re-examine the provided state.\n\n*Enemy State from current turn:*\nSnake #0 - Head: (7, 6), Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)], Apples: 10.\n*Apples list from current turn:* (7, 2) is an apple, (7, 6) is NOT listed as an apple. (1, 6) is an apple.\nIf the enemy moved to (7, 6) from (6, 6) and ate an apple, their score would be 10, which it is. Let's check the apples list from *before* the move, Turn 15: The apple list shown for Turn 15 *included* (7, 6).\nSo, Snake 0 did move from (6, 6) to (7, 6) and ate that apple, increasing their apple count from 9 to 10 and their length from 10 to 11.\n\nScores: Me 10, Enemy 10. We are tied.\n\nBoard size: 8x8 (0-7).\n\nApples available (15 total, after (7, 6) was eaten):\n(5, 0), (3, 2), (7, 2), (0, 4), (6, 3), (6, 0), (0, 5), (1, 2), (6, 1), (1, 1), (1, 6), (3, 5), (1, 3), (3, 3), (6, 2)\n\n**Snake Locations (Visualization/Threat Assessment):**\nID 1 (Me, Head @ (0, 3), aiming up Column 0): Safe, clear path ahead.\nID 0 (Enemy, Head @ (7, 6), top right corner): Just ate an apple. S0 is long (L=11). They are currently surrounded by empty space (7, 7), (6, 6) is their body, (7, 5) is empty. They are far away from the left side.\n\n**Current Goal:** Continue the column 0 sweep to capture (0, 4) and (0, 5) to regain the lead.\n\n**Possible moves from my current position (0, 3):**\n1. UP (0, 4): Apple! Safe. High priority move.\n2. DOWN (0, 2): My body segment (2nd segment). DEATH.\n3. LEFT (-1, 3): Off board. DEATH.\n4. RIGHT (1, 3): Apple! Safe. Good option, but breaks the vertical sweep.\n\n**Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:**\nIf I go UP to (0, 4): I eat an apple, regain the lead (11-10), and position myself for (0, 5) next turn. This is the continuation of the safest and most profitable path. My tail (2, 5) moves to (2, 4).\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 3): I eat an apple, regain the lead (11-10). The next logical apples are (1, 2) and possibly (1, 6), (1, 1). This is fine, but it leaves (0, 5) open for the enemy if they somehow manage to navigate there, although that seems very unlikely. It also brings me adjacent to a dense body of my own snake.\n\nSince (0, 4) and (0, 5) are immediate, sequential, and safe, `UP` is the optimal move to maximize points and maintain safety/flow.\n\n**Checking the threat posed by S0 (Head at 7, 6):**\nS0's possible moves from (7, 6):\n1. UP (7, 7): Empty.\n2. DOWN (7, 5): Empty. Towards (7, 2) apple.\n3. LEFT (6, 6): Body segment. DEATH.\n4. RIGHT (8, 6): Off board. DEATH.\n\nS0 will likely go DOWN to (7, 5) to aim for the (7, 2) apple, or UP to (7, 7) to explore. They pose no immediate threat.\n\n**Move chosen: UP (0, 3) -> (0, 4)**\nThis move is safe, secures an apple, and positions me for the next apple one square away.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\n1. Eat apple at (0, 4) [This turn].\n2. Eat apple at (0, 5) [Next turn].\n3. Look for follow-up apples: (1, 6) is close, or sweep down column 1 (e.g., (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1)). The area between columns 0 and 1 is heavily contested by my snake's own existing body, so moving carefully, perhaps aiming high first (1, 6), then using the vacated tail space, is prudent.\n\nUP",

I am ahead by 1 apple.\n\nBoard size: 8x8 (0-7).\n\nApples available (14 total):\n(5, 0), (3, 2), (7, 2), (6, 3), (6, 0), (0, 5), (1, 2), (6, 1), (1, 1), (1, 6), (3, 5), (1, 3), (3, 3), (6, 2), (0, 7) (Wait, the provided apple list at the top says 15 apples, let me check the list carefully against the board map)\n\nApples list: (5, 0), (3, 2), (7, 2), (6, 3), (6, 0), (0, 5), (1, 2), (6, 1), (1, 1), (1, 6), (3, 5), (1, 3), (3, 3), (6, 2), (0, 7).\nTotal 15 apples. (The board map shows 'A' at these locations.)\n\nBoard Map check:\n(0, 7) = A (Apple)\n(0, 5) = A (Apple)\n(1, 6) = A (Apple)\n(3, 5) = A (Apple)\n(6, 3) = A (Apple)\n(6, 2) = A (Apple)\n(7, 2) = A (Apple)\n(1, 3) = A (Apple)\n(3, 3) = A (Apple)\n(1, 2) = A (Apple)\n(3, 2) = A (Apple)\n(1, 1) = A (Apple)\n(6, 1) = A (Apple)\n(5, 0) = A (Apple)\n(6, 0) = A (Apple)\nConfirmed 15 visible apples. My previous move ate (0, 4).\n\n**Snake Locations (Visualization/Threat Assessment):**\nID 1 (Me, Head @ (0, 4), aiming up Column 0).\nID 0 (Enemy, Head @ (7, 5), near top right, moving down/left). They are currently far away.\n\n**Current Goal:** Continue the column 0 sweep to capture (0, 5) and (0, 7).\n\n**Possible moves from my current position (0, 4):**\n1. UP (0, 5): Apple! Safe. High priority move.\n2. DOWN (0, 3): My body segment (2nd segment). DEATH.\n3. LEFT (-1, 4): Off board. DEATH.\n4. RIGHT (1, 4): Empty. Safe. Could lead to (1, 3) apple or (1, 6) apple later, but less direct than UP.\n\n**Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:**\nIf I go UP to (0, 5): I eat an apple, extend my lead (12-10), and position myself for (0, 7) next, after clearing the body segment (0, 6). This is the safest and most efficient path for immediate points. My tail (2, 5) moves to (2, 4).\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 4): I maintain my position, don't eat an apple, and open up the path for the enemy to potentially grab (0, 5). This is suboptimal.\n\nUP is clearly the best choice.\n\n**Checking the threat posed by S0 (Head at 7, 5):**\nS0's possible targets: (7, 2) apple.\nS0's possible moves from (7, 5):\n1. UP (7, 6): Body segment. DEATH.\n2. DOWN (7, 4): Empty. Good setup for (7, 2).\n3. LEFT (6, 5): Empty.\n4. RIGHT (8, 5): Off board. DEATH.\n\nS0 will likely go DOWN to (7, 4) to approach the (7, 2) apple. They are still of no immediate concern to my scoring strategy on the left side.\n\n**Move chosen: UP (0, 4) -> (0, 5)**\nThis move is safe, secures an apple, and maintains an excellent path for future scoring (heading toward (0, 7) and then column 1 apples).\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\n1. Eat apple at (0, 5) [This turn].\n2. Next turn, move UP towards (0, 6). (0, 6) is currently empty space. Then move UP to (0, 7) for the final apple in this column.\n3. After (0, 7), my snake head will be at the top left corner. The next cluster of apples is in column 1 (1, 6) or I can sweep right (e.g., towards (3, 5)). Given that (1, 6) is very close and accessible, that seems like the next priority. We must be mindful of our long body when moving back down/right.\n\nUP",

Length: 13 (I ate an apple at (0, 5) last turn, increasing length from 12 to 13).\nBody: [(0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)].\nApples collected: 13.\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0) Head is at (7, 4). Length: 11 (They moved from (7, 5) to (7, 4), did not eat an apple).\nBody: [(7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)].\nApples collected: 10.\n\nScores: Me 13, Enemy 10. I am ahead by 3 apples.\n\nBoard size: 8x8 (0-7).\n\nApples available (14 total, since (0, 5) was eaten):\n(5, 0), (3, 2), (7, 2), (6, 3), (6, 0), (1, 2), (6, 1), (1, 1), (1, 6), (3, 5), (1, 3), (3, 3), (6, 2), (0, 7), (5, 3). (Wait, the original list was 15 apples. Let me re-check the list provided for this turn.)\n\nApples at: (5, 0), (3, 2), (7, 2), (6, 3), (6, 0), (1, 2), (6, 1), (1, 1), (1, 6), (3, 5), (1, 3), (3, 3), (6, 2), (0, 7), (5, 3).\n(0, 5) is no longer an apple, it's my head (H1).\nTotal 15 apples remaining is correct if one of the original 15 apples at (0, 5) was eaten and the list provided for T=18 *is* the list of current apples. Let's assume the list provided 15 current apples is accurate, or if one apple was implicitly removed (5, 3) was added in the apple list provided for T=18 compared to T=17. Since the map shows 'A' at (0, 7), that is the next apple target.\n\nLet's check the board map provided for Turn 18:\n 7 A . . T T T . .\n 6 . A . T T T T T\n 5 1 . T A T . . T\n 4 T . T . . . . 0\n 3 T A T A . A A .\n 2 T A T A . . A A\n 1 T A T . . . A .\n 0 T T T . . A A .\nThe A at (0, 5) is indeed replaced by '1' (My head). The 'A' at (0, 7) is my next target.\n\n**Snake Locations (Visualization/Threat Assessment):**\nID 1 (Me, Head @ (0, 5)). Continuing up column 0.\nID 0 (Enemy, Head @ (7, 4)). Approaching apples on the right side, maybe (7, 2) or (6, 3).\n\n**Current Goal:** Continue the column 0 sweep to capture (0, 7).\n\n**Possible moves from my current position (0, 5):**\n1. UP (0, 6): Empty cell. Safe. Positions for apple at (0, 7).\n2. DOWN (0, 4): My body segment. DEATH.\n3. LEFT (-1, 5): Off board. DEATH.\n4. RIGHT (1, 5): Empty cell (T). Safe. Moves me off the vertical path.\n\n**Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:**\n\nIf I go UP to (0, 6):\n- Safe move.\n- Positions me optimally to grab the apple at (0, 7) next turn.\n- My tail segment (2, 5) will move to (2, 4), freeing up (2, 5).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 5) (Tile 'T' - Enemy Body at (1, 5) is not true, board says (1, 5) is empty, but (2, 5) is my tail segment). Wait, let's re-examine the body list: `Body: [(0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]`. The body list confirms my tail is at (2, 5).\n\nCheck board state visualization:\nRow 5: `1 . T A T . . T`\n(0, 5) = 1 (My Head)\n(1, 5) = . (Empty) **Correction: The board shows 'T' at (2, 5), (4, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5).**\nLet's check my body segments for conflicts:\n(0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)\n(1, 0)\n(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5) - Tail is at (2, 5).\n\nSo, if I move RIGHT to (1, 5):\n- (1, 5) is an empty cell ('.'). Safe.\n- This immediately changes my goal away from the very close (0, 7) apple. If I go right, I would typically aim to sweep across the top area, perhaps toward (1, 6).\n\nThe path UP to (0, 6) then (0, 7) is a guaranteed apple sequence in the next two turns and is fundamentally safe. It's the highest priority move.\n\n**Move chosen: UP (0, 5) -> (0, 6)**\nThis maintains momentum towards the next apple (0, 7).\n\n**Checking Enemy (0) movement:**\nHead at (7, 4).\nPossible moves:\n1. UP (7, 5): Body segment. DEATH.\n2. DOWN (7, 3): Empty.\n3. LEFT (6, 4): Empty.\n4. RIGHT (8, 4): Off board. DEATH.\n\nS0 will likely move LEFT to (6, 4) or DOWN to (7, 3) to approach the central/right apples. They are still not a threat to my immediate path.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\n1. Move UP to (0, 6) [This turn].\n2. Move UP to (0, 7) in the next turn (Apple!).\n3. From (0, 7), move right to (1, 7) or down/right to (1, 6) (Apple). (1, 6) seems like the immediate target since it's an apple, but going to (1, 7) first might be safer if my body creates a wall. (0, 7) is an apple, so my length will be 14.\n4. If I go (0, 7) -> (1, 7) -> (2, 7) ... this is the top empty row. Then I can turn down toward the core apples.\n5. If I go (0, 7) -> (1, 7), then I can turn DOWN to (1, 6) which is an apple. This seems like a good route.\n\nUP",

From (7,3) I\u2019d have two forward apple options (7,2) or 6,3.\n- LEFT to (6,4) moves me directly into the apple cluster around x=5\u20136.

Neither LEFT nor DOWN steps onto an apple this turn (so my tail will advance), which makes keeping options open important.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move into the x=6 column to grab nearby apples (6,3 then sweep 6,2/6,1/6,0 and 5,3/5,0), while avoiding tight turns that trap me against my own body at x=3..5.\n- Keep exits toward the right (columns 6\u20137) and downwards open so I can retreat if needed.\n\nDecision:\nLEFT",

Also a good move.\n\n**Comparing UP vs. RIGHT (Apple vs. Apple):**\n\n1. UP to (0, 7):\n   - Eats an apple immediately.\n   - Puts me on the top edge of the board.\n   - Next likely move is RIGHT to (1, 7) (empty) or (1, 6) (already eaten or next apple).\n\n2. RIGHT to (1, 6):\n   - Eats an apple immediately.\n   - Puts me next to another apple at (1, 7) (if new apple spawns) or (0, 7) (which would suddenly be behind me). Wait, the apple at (1, 6) is the one I see.\n   - Next likely move is UP to (1, 7) or DOWN to (1, 5).\n\nSince I am already perfectly aligned in column 0, moving UP to (0, 7) maintains the straight line momentum and clears the corner efficiently.

(Two apples in three turns).\n\nBoth options guarantee an apple this turn. UP is slightly more straightforward as it follows the wall and opens up the full top row traverse. My path has been mostly vertical, so continuing to clear the wall is consistent.\n\n**Enemy Snake (0) Consideration:**\nHead at (6, 4).
