A . . . . . .\nRow 0: 0 1 . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\n### Immediate Observations:\n1. **Safe Moves**: The snake is at (0, 0), so it can move **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT**, or **RIGHT**.\n   - **UP**: (0, 1) - Valid, no immediate collision.\n   - **DOWN**: (1, 0) - Valid, no immediate collision.\n   - **LEFT**: (-1, 0) - Invalid (off the board).\n   - **RIGHT**: (1, 1) - Valid, no immediate collision.\n\n   So, **LEFT** is invalid, so we can eliminate it.\n\n2. **Eating Apples**:\n   - The closest apple is at (0, 2). Moving **UP** to (0, 1) is not an apple.\n   - Moving **DOWN** to (1, 0) is not an apple.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 1) is not an apple.\n   - However, if we move **UP** to (0, 1), we can then move **UP** again to (0, 2) and eat the apple. But since we can only move one direction per turn, we need to consider the next turn.\n\n### Enemy Movement:\n- The enemy snake is at (0, 9). It can move **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT**, or **RIGHT**.\n  - **UP**: (0, 8) - Valid.\n  - **DOWN**: (1, 9) - Valid.\n  - **LEFT**: (-1, 9) - Invalid.\n  - **RIGHT**: (0, 10) - Invalid.\n\n  So, the enemy can move **UP** or **DOWN**.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\n- The snake is at the bottom-left corner. Moving **UP** or **RIGHT** will allow us to explore the board and reach apples.\n- Moving **UP** to (0, 1) is safer because it keeps the snake moving upwards, which is away from the enemy's potential movement.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 1) might lead to a collision with the enemy if the enemy moves **DOWN** to (1, 9) and then we might be in a tight space.\n\n### Next Turn Plan:\n- Move **UP** to (0, 1) to keep the snake moving upwards and avoid potential collisions.\n- This will allow us to explore the board and reach the apple at (0, 2) in the next turn.\n\n### Final Decision:\n**UP**",

(3,1) is closest to the enemy\u2019s path if it moves **DOWN**.\n5. **Avoid Traps:** Never move directly backward (e.g., from (0,1) to (0,0)) or into the enemy\u2019s body.
