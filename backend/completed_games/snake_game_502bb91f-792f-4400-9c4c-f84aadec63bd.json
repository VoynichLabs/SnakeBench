However, if we move right immediately, we will be aligned with the enemy snake (ID: 0), which could be risky if it moves in our direction in the next turn.\n\nA safer approach would be to first move up to (7, 9), which is an empty space, and then plan to move right towards the apple at (8, 4) on the next turn. This way, we avoid any immediate conflict with the enemy snake and position ourselves for a clear path to the apple.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP.\n\nFor the next turn strategy, I plan to move RIGHT to collect the apple at (8, 4), and then continue moving down to collect the apple at (8, 0).

We should focus on moving towards apples while avoiding collisions.\n2. **Apple Proximity:**\n   - The closest apple is at (4, 2). Distance from (3, 6) to (4, 2) is:\n     - Horizontal distance: |4 - 3| = 1\n     - Vertical distance: |2 - 6| = 4\n     - Total steps: 1 (right) + 4 (down) = 5 steps.\n   - Other apples are further away or not in a straight path.\n3. **Enemy Snake:**\n   - Enemy snake is at (7, 8), which is far from our current position. No immediate threat.\n4. **Wall Avoidance:**\n   - All possible moves are within bounds, so no immediate wall collision risk.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nSince none of the adjacent cells have apples, we should choose a direction that starts us towards the closest apple at (4, 2). The first step towards this apple would be to move **DOWN** (decrease y-coordinate from 6 to 5), as this reduces the vertical distance to the apple.\n\nHowever, let's check if moving **RIGHT** (to (4, 6)) is better:\n- Moving right brings us closer to the apple's x-coordinate (from 3 to 4), but the y-coordinate remains the same. The apple is at y=2, so moving down is more effective in reducing the distance.\n\nAlternatively, moving **LEFT** (to (2, 6)) moves us away from the apple's x-coordinate (from 3 to 2), which is not ideal.\n\nMoving **UP** (to (3, 7)) moves us further away from the apple's y-coordinate (from 6 to 7), which is not ideal.\n\nThus, the best immediate move is **DOWN** to (3, 5), as it starts us on the path towards the apple at (4, 2).\n\n### Verification:\nAfter moving down to (3, 5):\n- Next step towards (4, 2) would be to move right to (4, 5), then down to (4, 4), etc. This is a valid path.\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- No immediate collision risks with the enemy snake or walls.\n- No risk of running into our own body since our body is empty.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is **DOWN** to (3, 5), starting the path towards the closest apple at (4, 2).\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**",

          "rationale": "### Current Board State Analysis:\n- **Our Snake (ID: 0):**\n  - Head at (3, 2) (after moving LEFT to eat the apple at (4, 2) in the previous move)\n  - Body: [(4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)] (length = 4, since we grew after eating the apple at (4, 2))\n- **Enemy Snake (ID: 1):**\n  - Head at (6, 5)\n  - Body: [(6, 4)] (length = 2)\n- **Apples:**\n  - (8, 0), (7, 8), (5, 6), (8, 7) (no apples have been eaten since the last move)\n\n### Possible Moves from (3, 2):\n1. **UP (increase y-coordinate):** (3, 3)\n   - Valid move, no collision, and (3, 3) is our own body segment (the next segment after the head). This would cause a collision and kill us. Invalid move.\n   - Wait, no: after moving to (3, 2), the body segments shift forward. The new body will be [(3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. The tail (3, 3) is removed after the move is executed, so the body becomes [(3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)]. Now, moving UP to (3, 3) would collide with the tail (3, 3) before it is removed. However, the tail is removed after the move is executed, so moving UP to (3, 3) would collide with the tail (3, 3) before it is removed. This is invalid.\n\n   Correction: After moving to (3, 2), the body is [(3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. The tail (3, 3) is removed after the move is executed, so the body becomes [(3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)]. Now, moving UP to (3, 3) would collide with the tail (3, 3) before it is removed. This is invalid.\n\n2. **DOWN (decrease y-coordinate):** (3, 1)\n   - Valid move, no collision, no apple. This would move us further down, but there are no apples in this direction in the immediate vicinity.\n\n3. **LEFT (decrease x-coordinate):** (2, 2)\n   - Valid move, no collision, no apple. This is a safe move, but doesn't lead to an apple immediately.\n\n4. **RIGHT (increase x-coordinate):** (4, 2)\n   - Valid move, no collision, no apple. This is also a safe move, but doesn't lead to an apple immediately.\n\n### Strategy:\n- After moving to (3, 2), we need to move away from our own body to avoid collision. The only valid moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- The closest apples are at (5, 6) (Manhattan distance = 5) and (8, 0) (Manhattan distance = 12). None are immediately reachable in one move.\n- The enemy snake is at (6, 5) and (6, 4), which is not immediately threatening. We should avoid moving closer to it unless necessary.\n- The safest immediate move is to move RIGHT to (4, 2) or LEFT to (2, 2). Moving DOWN to (3, 1) is also safe but less strategic since there are no apples in that direction.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 2) is slightly better because it opens up more options to move toward the apple at (5, 6) in the future.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best move is **RIGHT** to (4, 2). This avoids collision with our own body and keeps us in a position to potentially move toward future apples.\n\n### Next Strategy:\nAfter moving to (4, 2), we should reassess the board. Possible next steps could include:\n1. Moving UP to (4, 3) to start moving toward the apple at (5, 6).\n2. Moving RIGHT to (5, 2) to head toward the apple at (5, 6).\n3. Moving DOWN to (4, 1) to explore other parts of the board.\n\nHowever, the immediate next move after moving to (4, 2) should be **UP** to (4, 3) to start moving toward the apple at (5, 6).\n\n### Final Move:\n**RIGHT**",
