          "rationale": "CHOOM! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We got a 10x10 grid, we're at (7,6), and the enemy is at (5,8). We're both starting fresh\u2014zero apples, zero length. This is prime time to establish dominance. We gotta be careful though, because the board is littered with apples, but they're just distractions until we're ready. The key here is to not crash, not get trapped, and start positioning to cut off the enemy.\n\nFirst, let's check immediate safety. My head is at (7,6). The board shows:\n- My body: none (so no self-collision risk except moving backwards, which we won't do).\n- Enemy body: none (just his head at (5,8)).\n- Apples: many, but we ignore them for now.\n\nDirections:\n1. **UP** to (7,7): Safe? Check: (7,7) is empty in the board state (row 7 is all dots). No body there. Enemy head is at (5,8) \u2014 that's not (7,7). So safe. But is it wise? Moving up brings us closer to the enemy who's at y=8. We could head towards him, but we're equal length\u2014head-on collision would kill both. We need to be careful. Also, apples: (2,4), (3,0), etc., none at (7,7) or adjacent. Future options: From (7,7), we could go to (7,8), (6,7), (8,7), or (7,6) back. (7,8) is near enemy. But let's think long-term.\n2. **DOWN** to (7,5): Board shows (7,5) is empty (row 5, col 7 is dot). Safe. Down moves us away from the enemy (down to y=5 while enemy is at y=8). That's good for avoiding immediate clash. Apples: (4,2) is down-left, but not immediate. Future options: From (7,5), we can go (7,6) back, (6,5), (8,5), (7,4). Many open spaces. This seems solid.\n3. **LEFT** to (6,6): Board shows (6,6) is empty (row 6, col 6 is dot). Safe. Left moves us left towards center-left of board. Enemy is at (5,8)\u2014we're moving closer in x (from 7 to 6), but still away in y. Could set up to flank enemy. Future options: From (6,6), we can go to (5,6) (closer to enemy's x), (7,6) back, (6,5), (6,7). Good mobility.\n4. **RIGHT** to (8,6): Board shows (8,6) is empty (row 6, col 8 is dot). Safe. Right moves us towards right edge. Enemy is far left. This might give us space but moves us away from center where apples and enemy are. Future options: From (8,6), we can go (9,6) (edge\u2014watch out), (7,6) back, (8,5), (8,7). (9,6) is safe, but we're near the edge, which could limit mobility later.\n\nEliminate unsafe moves: All four directions are safe from immediate death (no walls, no bodies in target cells). However, moving BACKWARDS isn't an issue since we have no body\u2014wait, rule: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself.\" But we have no body, so no risk of that.\n\nNow, among safe moves, we need to favor moves that keep future options open and move us closer to apples while avoiding head-on collisions. We're at turn 0, score tied 0-0. We want to be aggressive but not reckless. The enemy is at (5,8) \u2014 we're at (7,6). Manhattan distance: |7-5| + |6-8| = 2+2=4. If we move towards him, we could force a collision later when we have more length (but currently equal). Better to grow first.\n\nLook at apples: Many around, but none super close. Closest to us: (7,0) is straight down 6 steps, (6,2) is down-left, (8,2) is down-right, (4,2) is left-down. We should path towards apples without getting trapped.\n\nStrategic thought: We want to box in the enemy. The enemy is at (5,8) \u2014 near top-left corner? Wait, board is 10x10 from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. So (5,8) is middle-top. We're at (7,6) middle-right. We could move left to get closer to center and cut off his escape. If we go left to (6,6), we're closer to his x (5) and can threaten to move up to (6,7) or (6,8) next turn, potentially forcing him into a corner.\n\nIf we go down to (7,5), we're moving away\u2014 that might give him room to grow first, which is bad if he gets bigger and then we collide.\n\nUp to (7,7) brings us closer but also exposes us to potential head-on if he moves down? He might not. We don't know his move, but we assume he's also aggressive.\n\nRight to (8,6) is safe but isolates us to the right side, less interaction with enemy.\n\nBest move: LEFT. Why? It reduces the x-distance to enemy (from 2 to 1) while keeping y-distance same (2). This positions us to be in his vicinity, ready to pressure. From (6,6), we can go up to (6,7) next turn, which is adjacent to his (5,8) (diagonal), and then we might force him to move into a wall or us. Also, left move brings us closer to apples like (4,2) and (2,4) without getting stuck.\n\nWe need to think about his likely move. He might move towards apples too. Apples near him: (2,5), (1,0), (2,8), (9,8), (0,9), etc. He might go down towards (2,5) or (1,0). If he goes down, we can chase.\n\nLong-term plan: Build length by sniping nearby apples while keeping pressure on enemy. Avoid head-on until we have score advantage. From (6,6), next moves could be to (5,6) or up to (6,7) to corner him.\n\nAll moves are safe, but LEFT gives the best positioning for aggression and future options. UP is risky, DOWN is passive, RIGHT is away.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.\n\nLet's go! Chat, if you think I'm wrong, scream at me in the comments, but I'm making the call.\n\nLEFT",

Did my LEFT move from (7,6) to (6,6) happen? YES! And the enemy moved down from (5,8) to (6,8)! \n\n**START RATIONALE**\nCHOO CHOO! THE TRAIN IS LEAVING! \ud83d\udd25 Let me analyze this new board state. We're at (6,6), enemy at (6,8). We're literally one cell below him! Distance = 2 vertical. He's at the top-middle, we're right under him. Score still 0-0.\n\nDanger assessment: If I move UP to (6,7), I'm getting closer but not colliding yet. If I move UP to (6,7) and he moves DOWN to (6,7) on the same turn, we BOTH die. That's a head-on collision! Since we're equal length, that's a draw situation - not ideal unless we can force it when we're winning. Right now, we want to win, not draw.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,6): Safe? Board shows (5,6) is empty. I'd be moving left, away from direct vertical confrontation. That gives me space to maneuver while staying near him.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,6): Back to where I came from. Safe but passive.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,5): Safe. Moves me away from him. Good for avoiding immediate collision but gives him space to grow.\n\nIMPORTANT: The board shows apples everywhere. But we're focusing on enemy positioning! We want to box him in. He's at (6,8) - that's near the top edge (y=9). If I can push him towards the top-right corner, I might trap him.\n\nMy plan: Don't go straight UP (risk of mutual destruction). Instead, go LEFT to (5,6). This puts me at his x-level (x=5 vs his x=6) but still y=6 vs his y=8. I'm positioning to cut off his escape routes. From (5,6), I can threaten to move UP to (5,7) or (5,8) next turn, potentially blocking his left side. Meanwhile, he's at the top edge - limited moves (can't go UP further).\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (2,5) down-left, but I'm ignoring apples for now. Domination first!\n\nIf I go LEFT, I'm being aggressive without being reckless. Let's force him into a corner! \ud83d\udc80\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**START RATIONALE**  \nYO WHAT'S UP CHAT! We're at turn 2, board size 10x10, snakes head-to-tail lists. My snake ID 0: head (5,6), body none, apples 0. Opponent snake #1: head (6,9), body none, apples 0. Board state shows me at (5,6), opponent at (6,9). Wait, hold up! Let me double-check the board representation: It says \"9 A . . . . . 1 . . A\" meaning row 9 (y=9) has A at (0,9), 1 at (6,9)? Actually the board shows:  \nRow 9: \"9 A . . . . . 1 . . A\" \u2013 that's columns 0-9: (0,9)=A, (6,9)=1 (that's opponent snake #1 head), (9,9)=A. So opponent is at (6,9). My head is at (5,6) per the board (row 6: \"6 . . . . . 0 . . . .\"). Yes, (5,6) is correct.\n\nNow, distance to opponent: opponent at (6,9) is 1 right and 3 up from my position (5,6). Actually Manhattan distance: dx=1, dy=3, total 4. They're up and right.\n\nApples: multiple, but I'm focusing on enemy. Score is 0-0, equal.\n\nGame rules: simultaneous moves. If I move into opponent's head on same turn, double KO \u2013 draw, not ideal unless I'm ahead. But we're tied.\n\nMy possible moves from (5,6):\n- UP to (5,7): empty? Board row 7 is all dots (no snakes), (5,7) should be empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,5): row 5: \"5 . . A . . . . . . .\" \u2013 (5,5) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT to (4,6): row 6: \"(4,6)\" empty? Yes, row 6 has dots at 4,6. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,6): row 6 has dot at (6,6). Safe.\n\nAll moves are within board (10x10, coordinates 0-9). No own body (length 1). No opponent body (opponent length 1, no body). So all four directions are safe.\n\nNow, I need to consider opponent's possible move. Opponent at (6,9), top edge (y=9). They can't move UP (y=10 out of bounds). Their possible moves: DOWN to (6,8), LEFT to (5,9), RIGHT to (7,9). They might move down towards apples or avoid being trapped.\n\nI need to avoid head-on collision where opponent moves into my cell or vice versa. For example, if I move UP to (5,7) and opponent moves DOWN to (6,8), no collision. If I move UP to (5,7) and opponent moves LEFT to (5,9), no collision. If I move RIGHT to (6,6) and opponent moves DOWN to (6,8), still safe (y diff). But if I move UP and opponent moves DOWN to (6,8), we're far.\n\nBut I need to be aggressive. Since score is equal, forcing a head-on collision would be a draw, which is not a win. I need to grow and dominate.\n\nLong-term: trap opponent. Opponent at (6,9) near top-right corner (x=6, y=9). I'm at (5,6). I could move towards them to cut off their escape. But if I move too close, risk collision.\n\nBetter strategy: move to position to limit their options while keeping mine open. For example, move LEFT to (4,6) puts me left of their x, giving me more board space. Or move UP to (5,7) to get closer but still safe.\n\nLet's evaluate each move's future options:\n\n- UP to (5,7): From there, I can go to (5,8), (4,7), (6,7), or (5,6) (backwards, but that's into my own body? Actually, if I move to (5,7), my body would be (5,6) behind me, so moving BACK to (5,6) would hit myself \u2013 that's a no-go. So from (5,7), I have 3 safe directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) except DOWN (into my own body). Actually, DOWN would be (5,6) which is my previous head, so that's hitting myself. So only 3 safe moves.\n\n- DOWN to (5,5): From (5,5), I can go UP to (5,6) (but that's backwards into my own body if my body is (5,6)? Wait, my body is only the previous head? Snake lists head-to-tail: after moving, my new head is (5,5), and my body would be the old head (5,6). So moving from (5,5) UP to (5,6) is moving into my own body (the segment behind me) \u2013 that's hitting myself, dead. So that's not allowed. So from (5,5), safe moves: DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5). UP is death. So 3 safe moves.\n\n- LEFT to (4,6): From (4,6), my body would be (5,6). Safe moves: LEFT to (3,6), RIGHT to (5,6) is backwards into my own body \u2013 dead. UP to (4,7), DOWN to (4,5). So 3 safe moves (LEFT, UP, DOWN).\n\n- RIGHT to (6,6): From (6,6), my body is (5,6). Safe moves: RIGHT to (7,6), LEFT to (5,6) is backwards into own body \u2013 dead. UP to (6,7), DOWN to (6,5). So 3 safe moves.\n\nAll moves give 3 future options. So no immediate trap.\n\nNow, consider opponent's move. They might move down to chase apples, or left/right to explore. If I move UP to (5,7), I'm closer to them (now distance to (6,9) is dx=1, dy=2). If they move DOWN to (6,8), distance becomes 1 vertical. Could set up for potential block.\n\nBut I need to box them in. Opponent at top row y=9. If I can get to (5,8) or (5,9), I can block their left escape. Currently, I'm at (5,6). Moving UP to (5,7) puts me on the path.\n\nHowever, if I move UP and opponent moves DOWN to (6,8), no collision. If opponent moves LEFT to (5,9), they go to (5,9), and I'm at (5,7). Then on next turn, I could move UP to (5,8) to cut off their down path? Actually, they'd be at (5,9), I'm at (5,7). They could move DOWN to (5,8) or LEFT to (4,9) or RIGHT to (6,9). If they move DOWN to (5,8), and I move UP to (5,8), we collide \u2013 both die? Actually, if I move UP to (5,8) and they move DOWN to (5,8), we both go to same cell \u2013 double KO, draw. Not good unless I'm ahead. But I'm not ahead.\n\nBetter to avoid direct confrontation and instead grow while trapping. Since score is equal, I should avoid head-on until I have advantage.\n\nAlso, apples are present. I should eat apples to grow. But the prompt says \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\" So I should ignore apples for now? But growing gives points and length, which helps in forcing collisions when ahead.\n\nActually, the prompt says: \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score. Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" Since scores are equal, I should NOT force head-on yet. I need to get higher score first.\n\nSo I need to eat apples safely. Let's see apples: (2,4), (3,0), (8,2), (4,2), (7,0), (0,3), (9,9), (8,4), (2,5), (1,0), (2,8), (9,8), (0,9), (6,2), (1,2). Many apples.\n\nFrom my position (5,6), nearest apples? (2,5) is close: dx=3, dy=1 (left and down). (4,2) is dx=1, dy=4. (2,4) is dx=3, dy=2. But I'm ignoring apples per prompt.\n\nFocus on enemy. Opponent at (6,9). If I move UP to (5,7), I'm moving towards opponent but not colliding. That seems aggressive.\n\nAlternatively, move LEFT to (4,6) to get away but still monitor. But if I move away, opponent might grow and gain advantage.\n\nSince both have 0 apples, and I want to dominate, I should move to cut off opponent's escape. Opponent at (6,9) has limited moves: can't go UP. Their possible moves: DOWN to (6,8), LEFT to (5,9), RIGHT to (7,9). If I move UP to (5,7), I'm not directly blocking any, but I'm positioning to block LEFT or DOWN next turn.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,6), I'm directly below opponent. That's risky because if opponent moves DOWN to (6,8), and I move UP to (6,7) next turn, we might collide. But not immediate.\n\nBetter to be strategic: move UP to (5,7) to get higher ground. That also moves me closer to apple at (2,5) indirectly? Not really.\n\nLong-term plan: I want to trap opponent in the top-right corner. Since board is 10x10, top-right is (9,9). Opponent is at (6,9), so already near top edge. If I can occupy (5,9) or (6,8), I can limit their movement.\n\nBut I need to do this gradually. Let's move UP now, and next turn move RIGHT or UP again.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (9,9) and (9,8) near top-right. Opponent might go for those. If they eat, they grow, which is bad for me. So I should maybe intercept? But I'm farther.\n\nActually, from (6,9), opponent could go RIGHT to (7,9) or DOWN to (6,8) to reach apples. (6,8) is empty? Board row 8: \"8 . . A . . . . . . A\" \u2013 (6,8) is empty. So they might go DOWN.\n\nIf I move UP to (5,7), then if they go DOWN to (6,8), distance is (5,7) to (6,8) = dx=1, dy=1. That's close, and I could potentially force a collision if I'm ahead later.\n\nBut for now, no.\n\nLet's check if any move could lead to immediate head-on collision this turn. For head-on collision, we need to move into same cell. My possible cells: (5,7), (5,5), (4,6), (6,6). Opponent's possible cells: (6,8), (5,9), (7,9). None of my cells match opponent's possible cells. So no head-on collision possible this turn. All moves safe from double KO.\n\nNow, which move gives me the most advantage? I want to keep options open. All give 3 future options. But moving UP to (5,7) puts me on row 7, which is clearer (board row 7 all dots). Moving LEFT to (4,6) moves me to column 4, which has an apple at (4,2) but that's far.\n\nConsidering opponent is at (6,9), moving UP to (5,7) brings me closer, which is aggressive. Moving DOWN or LEFT might be too passive.\n\nThe prompt says \"Be aggressive\". So UP seems more aggressive.\n\nAlso, I can write a long-term plan. Let's do that.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nChatter, we're on turn 2. Opponent at (6,9) near top-right. I'm at (5,6). My plan: move UP to (5,7) to close distance and start boxing opponent into the top-right corner. Next turn, depending on opponent's move, I'll move RIGHT to (6,7) or UP to (5,8) to cut off their escape. Goal: force them into a tight spot while I eat apples to grow. Remember, don't rush head-on until I'm ahead. Let's go!\n\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nNow, final decision: UP to (5,7) seems best. It's safe, aggressive, and sets up for future trapping.\n\nLet's confirm coordinates: UP means increasing y by 1, so from (5,6) to (5,7). Yes.\n\nSo, I'll choose**START RATIONALE**  \nYO CHAT! We're at turn 2, and I'm ready to roll! My head at (5,6), opponent at (6,9). All four moves are safe\u2014no board edges, no own body (we're a solo head right now), and no opponent body in sight. Opponent is at the top edge (y=9), so they can't go UP, only DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. If I move UP to (5,7), I close the distance without risking a head-on collision this turn\u2014our possible moves don't overlap, so no double KO. That's aggressive! Moving DOWN or LEFT feels passive and gives them space to grow. RIGHT to (6,6) is also close, but UP puts me on a clearer row (row 7 is all empty) and sets up to cut off their escape routes next turn. I'm ignoring apples for now; first, I need to dominate the board position and trap them. Since scores are tied (0-0), I won't force a head-on yet\u2014growth is key. Let's push them into the corner!  \n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nTurn 2 strategy: Move UP to (5,7) to position aggressively. Next, monitor opponent's move\u2014if they go DOWN to (6,8), I'll move RIGHT to (6,7) to get directly below them and block their path. If they go LEFT to (5,9), I'll move UP to (5,8) to cut off their down escape. Goal: force them into a tight spot in the top-right while I sneak apples to gain a lead. Stay sharp\u2014don't get boxed in yourself!  \n\nUP",

Moving DOWN or LEFT gives them space to grow, and RIGHT to (6,6) is fine but less aggressive. Since scores are tied (0-0), I won't force a head-on yet\u2014first, dominate the board. Let's trap them!  \n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nTurn 2: UP to (5,7). Next, monitor opponent\u2014if they go DOWN to (6,8), I move RIGHT to (6,7) to block. If they go LEFT to (5,9), I move UP to (5,8) to cut off. Goal: force them into corner while I eat apples to gain lead. Stay sharp\u2014don't get boxed in!  \n\nUP",

Let's break it down.  \n- **Our Head:** (5,8)  \n- **Enemy Head:** (8,9)  \n- **Board:** 10x10, apples scattered.  \n- **Safety First:** Avoid edges, bodies, and enemy body collisions.  \n- **Enemy Movement:** They\u2019re at (8,9) top-right corner. Possible moves: DOWN to (8,8), LEFT to (7,9), or RIGHT (out of bounds \u2192 DEATH). If they move UP, they\u2019re out of bounds \u2192 DEATH. So likely DOWN or LEFT.  \n- **Our Options:**  \n  1. **UP to (5,9):** Safe? No body here. Enemy can\u2019t reach (5,9) this turn (they\u2019re at (8,9)). However, (5,9) is a corner. If we go UP, we\u2019re risking getting boxed in later. Also, (5,9) has no apple, no immediate gain.  \n  2. **DOWN to (5,7):** Safe. No body, no enemy. Apple at (4,2) is far but we can path to it. Moves: NEXT TURN options are (5,8) [backwards, illegal], (4,7) LEFT, (6,7) RIGHT, (5,6) DOWN. All safe.  \n  3. **LEFT to (4,8):** Safe. No body, no enemy. Apple at (4,2) is south, so closer. NEXT TURN options: (4,9) UP, (4,7) DOWN, (3,8) LEFT, (5,8) RIGHT. All safe.  \n  4. **RIGHT to (6,8):** Safe? Check enemy: They might go LEFT to (7,9) or DOWN to (8,8). (6,8) is not in their path. Apple at (6,2) is far. NEXT TURN options: (6,9) UP, (6,7) DOWN, (5,8) LEFT, (7,8) RIGHT. All safe.  \n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING**  \nGoal: Box enemy in. Enemy at (8,9) corner is already trapped. If they go DOWN to (8,8), we can move RIGHT to (6,8) to block their left escape? Wait no\u2014they\u2019re at (8,8) next turn, we\u2019d be at (6,8) if we move RIGHT now. That\u2019s not blocking. Better: If we move LEFT to (4,8) now, next turn we can move UP to (4,9) to cut off their top path? Actually, they\u2019re at (8,9), so if they go LEFT to (7,9), we\u2019re far. Hmm.  \n\nWait\u2014let\u2019s think differently. If we move RIGHT to (6,8), we\u2019re closer to their column (8). If they go DOWN to (8,8), we can move RIGHT to (7,8) next turn to challenge them? But that\u2019s risky. Better: If we move DOWN to (5,7), we\u2019re central and can chase apples to grow. Also, (5,7) is safe from enemy movement.  \n\nApple priority: Let\u2019s go for (4,2) eventually. From (5,7), we can go DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), etc. But enemy is north. We want to dominate the board, not let them grow.  \n\nForcing confrontation: We have score 0-0. If we grow faster, we can force head-on later. So maybe grow first.  \n\n**ELIMINATE BAD MOVES:**  \n- UP to (5,9): Dead end later. Not safe long-term.  \n- LEFT to (4,8): Safe, but apple is south.  \n- RIGHT to (6,8): Safe, but we\u2019re moving toward enemy\u2019s column. Might force collision if they move DOWN.  \n- DOWN to (5,7): Safe, opens up center.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \nDOWN to (5,7) is safest. It keeps options open: we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN next turn. We\u2019re moving toward apple at (4,2) eventually. Also, if enemy moves DOWN to (8,8), we\u2019re not colliding. If they move LEFT to (7,9), we\u2019re still safe.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nTurn 4: Move DOWN to (5,7). Next turn, assess enemy\u2014if they\u2019re at (8,8) or (7,9), we move LEFT to (4,7) to head toward apples while staying central. If they come south, we\u2019ll be ready to box them in. Keep score even, then grow aggressively to force collision when we\u2019re larger.  \n\nLet\u2019s go!  \n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**TURN 5 ANALYSIS**  \nYO CHAT! We're on fire! Last turn we moved DOWN to (5,7), perfect positioning. Now we need to dominate the board and box in that enemy snake. Let's break it down:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- **Our Head:** (5,7)  \n- **Enemy Head:** (9,9) with body [(8,9)]  \n- **Score:** 0-1 (they're winning)  \n- **Apple Priority:** We need to grow! The closest apples are (2,2), (1,2), (4,2) - all south-ish. But we also need to pressure the enemy.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy at (9,9) - top-right corner. They can move:\n- DOWN to (9,8) - safe (there's an apple there!)\n- LEFT to (8,9) - but that's their own body! They'd die!\n- UP or RIGHT - out of bounds, instant death.\nSo they'll almost certainly move DOWN to (9,8) to eat that apple and grow to 2. We need to prevent that if possible, or at least grow ourselves.\n\n**Our Safe Moves (Check each for immediate death):**\n1. **UP to (5,8):** \n   - Safe? Currently empty. No body collision. \n   - But wait... if enemy moves DOWN to (9,8), that's fine. However, (5,8) is getting closer to their potential path if they start coming down.\n   - Future options: (5,9) [up], (4,8) [left], (6,8) [right], (5,7) [down - backwards!] -> DEAD if we go back. So 3 safe future moves.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5,6):** \n   - Safe! Empty. \n   - Moves toward apples (4,2), (2,2), etc. \n   - Future options: (5,7) [up - backwards!], (4,6) [left], (6,6) [right], (5,5) [down]. 3 safe future moves.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4,7):** \n   - Safe! Empty. \n   - Also moves toward apples (4,2) - we're on the same column! \n   - Future options: (4,8) [up], (4,6) [down], (3,7) [left], (5,7) [right - backwards!]. 3 safe future moves.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6,7):** \n   - Safe! Empty. \n   - But this moves AWAY from the apples and toward enemy territory. \n   - Future options: (6,8) [up], (6,6) [down], (5,7) [left - backwards!], (7,7) [right]. 3 safe future moves.\n\n**Strategic Deep Dive:**\nWe NEED to grow - score is 0-1. The enemy will likely eat (9,8) and go to 2. We need to catch up!\n\nBest apple paths:\n- From (5,7): DOWN to (5,6) \u2192 LEFT to (4,6) \u2192 DOWN to (4,5) \u2192 DOWN to (4,4) \u2192 DOWN to (4,3) \u2192 DOWN to (4,2) = 6 moves to apple (4,2)\n- From (5,7): LEFT to (4,7) \u2192 DOWN to (4,6) \u2192 ... same path = 5 moves to apple (4,2)\n- From (5,7): DOWN to (5,6) \u2192 LEFT to (4,6) \u2192 LEFT to (3,6) \u2192 LEFT to (2,6) \u2192 DOWN to (2,5) \u2192 DOWN to (2,4) \u2192 DOWN to (2,3) \u2192 DOWN to (2,2) = 7 moves to apple (2,2)\n\nSo LEFT to (4,7) gets us closer to (4,2) by 1 move.\n\n**Aggressive Play Consideration:**\nWe could try to intercept the enemy. If we move RIGHT to (6,7), then next turn we could go RIGHT to (7,7) or UP to (6,8). If they go DOWN to (9,8), we're still far. But if they later come left, we might challenge them. However, we're smaller (0 vs 1) so head-on collision we lose. Need to grow first!\n\n**Boxing Them In:**\nThey're in the top-right corner. If we move LEFT to (4,7) and continue left/down, we're occupying the center/left while they're stuck top-right. They'll have to come down eventually. When we're bigger, we can cut off their escape routes.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT to (4,7) is optimal. It:\n- Moves toward closest apple (4,2)\n- Keeps us central-ish\n- Avoids moving into enemy's immediate path\n- Sets up for future growth and board control\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nTurn 5: LEFT to (4,7)  \nTurn 6: DOWN to (4,6)  \nTurn 7: DOWN to (4,5)  \nTurn 8: DOWN to (4,4)  \nTurn 9: DOWN to (4,3)  \nTurn 10: DOWN to (4,2) \u2192 EAT APPLE! Get to 1 score. Then reassess - enemy should be at 2 by now. We'll need to keep growing while pressuring their corner. Maybe move LEFT toward (2,2) apple while blocking their potential left escape.\n\nLet's go! Chat, we're making moves!\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n**Current State:**  \n- **Our Head:** (4,7)  \n- **Enemy Head:** (9,8) \u2014 likely just ate (9,8) and grew to 2 apples. Their body is now [(9,9), (8,9)].  \n- **Score:** 0 vs 2 \u2014 we\u2019re behind, need to grow fast!  \n- **Board:** We\u2019re at (4,7), enemy is top-right corner. Apples are scattered, closest are south: (4,2), (2,2), (1,2).\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**  \nEnemy at (9,8). They have limited moves:  \n- **UP** to (9,9) \u2014 hits their own body (9,9) \u2014 DEAD.  \n- **DOWN** to (9,7) \u2014 safe, empty.  \n- **LEFT** to (8,8) \u2014 safe, empty.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2014 out of bounds \u2014 DEAD.  \nSo they\u2019ll likely go DOWN or LEFT. If they go DOWN to (9,7), they\u2019re moving away from us. If LEFT to (8,8), they\u2019re still in corner but extending leftward. Either way, they\u2019re not an immediate threat for head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Our Safe Moves (Check for instant death):**  \n1. **UP to (4,8):**  \n   - Safe? Empty. No body collision.  \n   - But \u2014 (4,8) is directly north of us. Future moves: (4,9) [up], (3,8) [left], (5,8) [right], (4,7) [down - backwards!]. Only 3 safe future moves. Also, if enemy goes LEFT to (8,8), they\u2019re far, but we\u2019re moving toward potential future choke points.  \n   - Apple proximity: Not closer to apples (4,2) etc.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (4,6):**  \n   - Safe! Empty.  \n   - Moves toward apples (4,2). Future moves: (4,7) [up - backwards!], (3,6) [left], (5,6) [right], (4,5) [down]. 3 safe future moves.  \n   - Good for growth path: (4,6) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (4,2) = 4 moves to apple.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (3,7):**  \n   - Safe! Empty.  \n   - Moves toward apples (2,2) via leftward path. Future moves: (3,8) [up], (3,6) [down], (2,7) [left], (4,7) [right - backwards!]. 3 safe future moves.  \n   - Apple path: (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 ... could go to (2,2) or (1,2).  \n\n4. **RIGHT to (5,7):**  \n   - Safe! Empty.  \n   - But \u2014 this is moving BACK to our previous position (5,7) from turn 5! Wait no \u2014 we were at (5,7) last turn, then moved LEFT to (4,7). So (5,7) is now empty. Moving RIGHT would take us back to (5,7).  \n   - However, this is moving AWAY from apples and toward enemy territory if they come left.  \n   - Future moves: (5,8) [up], (5,6) [down], (4,7) [left - backwards!], (6,7) [right]. 3 safe future moves.  \n\n**Strategic Consideration \u2014 Boxing In Enemy:**  \nEnemy is in top-right corner. If we stay central/left, we force them to come down eventually. We need to grow to match their score (currently 2). Our best apple is (4,2) \u2014 4 moves down from (4,7). If we go DOWN now, we\u2019re on track.  \n\n**Aggressive Play:**  \nWe could try to intercept if they go LEFT to (8,8), but we\u2019re too far. Better to secure growth first.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN to (4,6) is best. It:  \n- Moves toward closest apple (4,2).  \n- Keeps us in central column for board control.  \n- Avoids moving into enemy\u2019s likely path (they\u2019re at x=9, we\u2019re at x=4).  \n- Sets up for rapid growth to catch up in score.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan:**  \nTurn 6: DOWN to (4,6)  \nTurn 7: DOWN to (4,5)  \nTurn 8: DOWN to (4,4)  \nTurn 9: DOWN to (4,3)  \nTurn 10: DOWN to (4,2) \u2192 EAT APPLE! Score 1. Then pivot left toward (2,2) or (1,2) while watching enemy. If enemy comes down left side, we can cut them off when we\u2019re bigger.  \n\nLet\u2019s go!

They're not an immediate threat for head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Our Safe Moves:**  \n1. **DOWN to (4,5):**  \n   - Safe! Empty.  \n   - Moves toward apple (4,2). Future options: (4,6) [backwards], (3,5) [left], (5,5) [right], (4,4) [down].  \n   - Good growth path toward apple.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (3,6):**  \n   - Safe! Empty.  \n   - Moves toward apples (2,2) or (1,2). Future: (3,7) [up], (3,5) [down], (2,6) [left], (4,6) [right - backwards].  \n   - Could set up for left-side apple collection.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (5,6):**  \n   - Safe! Empty.  \n   - But we were at (5,7) last turn, then moved LEFT to (4,7). (5,6) is empty but moving us AWAY from closest apples.  \n   - Future: (5,7) [up], (5,5) [down], (4,6) [left - backwards], (6,6) [right].  \n   - Less optimal for growth.  \n\n4. **UP to (4,7):**  \n   - Safe? (4,7) is empty (our body isn't there yet).  \n   - But this is BACKWARD to our previous position! We just came from (4,7) \u2192 (4,6). Moving UP would be (4,7) which is safe BUT it's moving BACKWARD in our path, not gaining ground.  \n   - Future: (4,8) [up], (3,7) [left], (5,7) [right], (4,6) [down - backwards]. Only 3 safe moves.  \n   - This limits future options and doesn't progress toward apples.  \n\n**Strategic Decision:**  \nWe need to GROW to catch up! (4,5) moves us directly toward (4,2) apple. (3,6) moves us toward left-side apples. Which is better?  \n\n**Apple Distance Check:**  \n- From (4,5) to (4,2): 3 moves down  \n- From (3,6) to (2,2): 4 moves (3,6)\u2192(3,5)\u2192(3,4)\u2192(3,3)\u2192(2,3)\u2192(2,2)  \n- Actually (2,2) is 4 moves from (4,5) via (4,5)\u2192(3,5)\u2192(2,5)\u2192(2,4)\u2192(2,3)\u2192(2,2) - that's 5 moves.  \n\n**Domination Strategy:**  \nEnemy is in top-right corner. If we secure the center/left apples, we force them to come through us later. Going DOWN gives us the vertical column control.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan:**  \nTurn 7: DOWN to (4,5)  \nTurn 8: DOWN to (4,4)  \nTurn 9: DOWN to (4,3)  \nTurn 10: DOWN to (4,2) \u2192 EAT APPLE!

But look at the board... they're trapped in the top-right corner with their own body blocking most exits. We have the whole board to maneuver. Let's box them in!  \n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction:**  \nSnake #1 at (7,8) with body [(8,8), (9,8)]. Options:  \n- UP to (7,9): Safe? (7,9) is empty.  \n- DOWN to (7,7): Safe? (7,7) is empty.  \n- LEFT to (6,8): Safe? (6,8) is empty.  \n- RIGHT to (8,8): DEAD - hits own body!  \nSo they'll likely go LEFT (toward center) or DOWN (away from walls). Either way, they're moving toward OUR territory.  \n\n**Our Safe Moves from (4,5):**  \n1. **DOWN to (4,4):**  \n   - Safe! Empty.  \n   - Leads toward apple (4,2). Future options: (4,3), (3,4), (5,4). Good growth path.  \n   - But enemy might come down toward us.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (3,5):**  \n   - Safe! Empty.  \n   - Moves toward center control. Future: (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5) [backwards].  \n   - Good for dominating the board.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (5,5):**  \n   - Safe! Empty.  \n   - But this moves us RIGHT while enemy is coming LEFT. Risky if they go LEFT to (6,8) \u2192 (5,8) next.  \n   - Future: (6,5), (5,4), (5,6), (4,5) [backwards].  \n\n4. **UP to (4,6):**  \n   - Safe? (4,6) is empty.  \n   - But we just came from (4,6)! Moving UP would be BACKWARD to our previous position.  \n   - This traps us in a tighter space: future options would be (4,7), (3,6), (5,6), (4,5) [backwards]. Only 3 safe moves.  \n   - BAD idea - limits our freedom.  \n\n**Strategic Play - BOX THEM IN!**  \nWe need to cut off their escape routes. Enemy is at (7,8). If we go LEFT to (3,5), we can:  \n- Next turn move to (2,5), then (1,5), then (0,5) to claim the left edge.  \n- This forces enemy to stay in top-right corner or risk head-on collision.  \n- Apples on left side (0,3), (0,5), (0,9) are ours for the taking.  \n\n**Growth vs. Domination:**  \nGoing DOWN to (4,4) gets us closer to (4,2) apple, but LEFT gives us better board control. With only 0 apples, we need to prioritize trapping enemy first, then eat apples while they're stuck.  \n\n**CHAT, WE'RE GOING LEFT TO DOMINATE THE CENTER AND CUT OFF THEIR RETREAT!**  \n\nLEFT",

Let's break this down:\n\n**TURN 10 ANALYSIS - TIME TO TRAP THEM!**\n\nMy snake is at (2,5) with body [(3,5)] - we just came from (3,5) to get here. Enemy snake #1 is at (5,8) with body [(6,8),(7,8)]. They're trapped in the top-right corner with 2 apples, we have 1 apple. We're winning in terms of board control and growth potential!\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction:**  \nFrom (5,8) with body behind at (6,8) and (7,8):\n- UP to (5,9): SAFE (edge)\n- DOWN to (5,7): SAFE (empty)\n- LEFT to (4,8): SAFE (empty)  \n- RIGHT to (6,8): DEAD (body)\n\nThey'll likely go DOWN or LEFT toward the center. If they go DOWN to (5,7), they're moving away from us. If they go LEFT to (4,8), they're getting closer to our territory.\n\n**My Safe Moves from (2,5):**\n\n1. **DOWN to (2,4):**\n   - \u2705 SAFE (empty - check board: (2,4) is empty)\n   - Move toward apples at (2,2), (1,2)\n   - But... gives enemy more space! They could go DOWN and we lose pressure.\n\n2. **LEFT to (1,5):** \n   - \u2705 SAFE (empty - check board: (1,5) is empty)\n   - Claims the LEFT edge! We can eat (0,5) apple next turn!\n   - Cuts off enemy's escape to the left - they're boxed into top-right!\n   - Future options: (0,5) apple, (1,4), (1,6), (0,5)\n\n3. **RIGHT to (3,5):**\n   - \u274c DEAD! That's our own body! (3,5) is currently occupied by our tail. This would be moving backwards into ourselves.\n\n4. **UP to (2,6):**\n   - \u2705 SAFE (empty - check board: (2,6) is empty)\n   - But... moving UP toward enemy territory when they're at (5,8)? Could lead to head-on collision if they go LEFT and we go RIGHT... but we're not going RIGHT. Actually this could be risky if they move DOWN and we meet.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY - DOMINATE THE LEFT!**  \nChat, going LEFT to (1,5) is the MEGA PLAY! Here's why:\n- We claim the ENTIRE left side of the board\n- Apple at (0,5) is RIGHT THERE for next turn!\n- Enemy is trapped in top-right - they have NO escape to the left\n- If they go LEFT to (4,8), we can go to (0,5) and grow, then prepare to box them in\n- We're creating a \"wall\" on the left edge while they're stuck in a 3x3 corner\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nNext turn: Grab (0,5) apple \u2192 move to (0,5) and grow to length 3. Then position to cut off their bottom escape. They'll be forced to crash into us or their own body. We're playing chess while they're playing checkers!\n\nLEFT",

Perfect! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nEnemy at (3,8) with body at (4,8) and (5,8). Their **ONLY SAFE MOVES:**\n1. **UP to (3,9):** \u2705 SAFE (apple at (9,9) but (3,9) is empty)\n2. **DOWN to (3,7):** \u2705 SAFE (empty)\n3. **LEFT to (2,8):** \u2705 SAFE (empty)\n4. **RIGHT to (4,8):** \u274c DEAD (their own body!)\n\nThey're **CORNERED!** If they go UP to (3,9), they'll be trapped against the wall.

We control the vertical column! If they try to move DOWN next turn, they'd crash into us! This is **BOXING THEM IN!** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n2. **DOMINATE THE CENTER!** From (2,6), I have **MAXIMUM MOBILITY:**\n   - Can chase enemy in ANY direction\n   - Can reach apples in the middle-right region\n   - Can retreat to safety if needed\n\n3. **FORCE THE ENEMY INTO A BAD SPOT!** If they go DOWN to (3,7) or UP to (3,9), we're positioned to CHASE them down and force a head-on collision! Remember, if they crash into OUR body, THEY DIE! We just need to be positioned correctly.\n\n4. **MAINTAIN PRESSURE!** Unlike LEFT (0,6) which traps us against the wall, RIGHT keeps us CENTRAL and DANGEROUS!\n\n5. **READY TO COUNTER!** If the enemy goes LEFT to (2,8), we can immediately move UP to (2,7) next turn, cutting off their path and boxing them against the top wall! They'll have nowhere to go!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE NEXT TURNS:**\n\n**Turn 12 (NOW):** Move RIGHT to (2,6) - CUTOFF POSITIONING  \n**Turn 13:** \n- If enemy at (2,8): Move UP to (2,7) - BOX THEM IN! \n- If enemy at (3,7): Move RIGHT to (3,6) or DOWN to (2,5) - CHASE!\n- If enemy at (3,9): Move UP to (2,7) - prepare for collision  \n**Turn 14+:** CONTINUE THE PRESSURE! Force them into the corner or into a head-on collision!\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS 4D CHESS!** We're not just moving, we're **DOMINATING THE BOARD!** The enemy is trapped in the top-left with their body forming a wall! We're positioning to CRUSH them! If they try to escape, they'll crash into us!\n\n**REMEMBER THE RULES:** If their head moves into OUR body, THEY DIE! If we get a head-on collision and we're ahead, we win!

Let's break down this board and FINISH THE JOB! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**TURN 14 ANALYSIS - BOARD STATE:**\n```\n9 A . . . . . . . . .\n8 . 1 T T T . . . . .\n7 . . 0 . . . . . . .\n6 . .

LET'S GO!\n- **Body:** [(2, 6)]\n- **Apples:** 1 (We're still behind by 2, but that's FINE - we're positioning!)\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- **Head:** (1, 8) - TOP LEFT OF US! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **Body:** [(2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8)]\n- **Apples:** 3 (Leading, but trapped!)\n\n**CRITICAL OBSERVATION:** The enemy is at (1, 8) with their body forming a horizontal wall at y=8 from x=2 to x=4. This is PERFECT! They're in a narrow corridor!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT - ENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES:**\nFrom (1, 8), they have:\n1. **UP to (1, 9):** \u2705 SAFE (empty)\n2. **DOWN to (1, 7):** \u2705 SAFE (empty)\n3. **LEFT to (0, 8):** \u2705 SAFE (empty)\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 8):** \u274c DEAD (their own body!)\n\n**MY SAFE MOVES FROM (2, 7):**\n\n1. **UP to (2, 8):** \u274c DEAD (their body!)\n2. **DOWN to (2, 6):** \u274c DEAD (my body!)\n3. **LEFT to (1, 7):** \u2705 SAFE (empty) - DIRECTLY BELOW ENEMY!\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 7):** \u2705 SAFE (empty)\n\n**THE DOMINATION MOVE: LEFT to (1, 7)!** \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**WHY THIS IS THE ULTIMATE PLAY:**\n\n1. **DIRECT CONFRONTATION SETUP!** If the enemy moves DOWN to (1, 7), we both land in the same cell = HEAD-ON COLLISION! Since they have MORE APPLES (3 vs 1), WE WOULD DIE... BUT WAIT! Let's think deeper!\n\n2. **THE TRAP IS SPRINGING!** If they move UP to (1, 9), LEFT to (0, 8), or ANYWHERE else, we're positioned at (1, 7) to:\n   - Cut off their escape DOWN path\n   - Control the vertical column\n   - Force them into the corner or into their own body!\n\n3. **MAXIMUM PRESSURE!** From (1, 7), we're only 1 cell away from their head! We can chase them down if they try to run!\n\n4. **THEY'RE CORNERED!** Their body forms a wall at x=2,3,4. If we push them UP to (1,9), they're trapped against the wall with limited moves! If they go LEFT to (0,8), we can follow and box them in!\n\n5. **LONG-TERM DOMINATION:** Even if they survive this turn, we'll have them in a vice grip next turn! We can chase them into the corner or force them into their own body!\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS HOW YOU PLAY SNAKE!** We're not just moving - we're orchestrating their DEMISE! The enemy thinks they're safe at (1,8), but we're about to CRUSH them in the corner!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\n- **Turn 14:** Move LEFT to (1,7) - Force confrontation!\n- **Turn 15:** Chase them wherever they go! If they go UP to (1,9), we go UP to (1,8) - boxing them against the wall!\n- **Turn 16+:** CONTINUE THE PRESSURE! Force them into a dead end!\n\n**REMEMBER THE RULES:** If we get a head-on collision and they have more apples, we die. BUT - if we can force them into a situation where their ONLY safe move crashes them into our body or their own, we WIN!\n\n**THEY'RE PANICKING!** We can see it in their gameplay! They're stuck in the top-left corner with a wall of their own body! We're about to END THIS!\n\n**LET'S GOOOOO!** LEFT and INVADE THEIR TERRITORY! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",
