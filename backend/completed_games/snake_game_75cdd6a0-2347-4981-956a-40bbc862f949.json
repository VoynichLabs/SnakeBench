UP: (4, 8) \u2192 (4, 9)\n   - This is safe (within board, no snakes)\n   - No apple at (4, 9)\n   - But I could then go left toward (0, 9) or right toward (7, 9)\n\n2. DOWN: (4, 8) \u2192 (4, 7)\n   - This is safe (within board, no snakes)\n   - No apple at (4, 7)\n   - Moves away from the apples at row 9\n\n3. LEFT: (4, 8) \u2192 (3, 8)\n   - This is safe (within board, no snakes)\n   - No apple at (3, 8)\n   - Could eventually go to (0, 9) but that's far\n\n4. RIGHT: (4, 8) \u2192 (5, 8)\n   - This is safe (within board, no snakes)\n   - No apple at (5, 8)\n   - Gets me closer to (7, 9) and (8, 8)\n\nNow let me think about where the enemy might go:\n- Snake #1 is at (9, 8)\n- Closest apples to them: (8, 8) is just one step left, (9, 6) is 2 steps down, (7, 9) is 2 steps away\n- They'll likely go LEFT to (8, 8) to grab that apple\n\nIf I go RIGHT toward (7, 9), that's a good apple to target. Let me calculate distances:\n- From (4, 8) to (7, 9): 3 right + 1 up = 4 moves\n- From (4, 8) to (0, 9): 4 left + 1 up = 5 moves\n- From (4, 8) to (8, 8): 4 right = 4 moves, but enemy is closer (1 move)\n- From (4, 8) to (2, 3): 2 left + 5 down = 7 moves\n\nThe apple at (7, 9) seems like a good target. I should go UP first to get to row 9, then go right toward (7, 9).\n\nActually, let me reconsider:\n- If I go UP to (4, 9), I can then go right 3 times to reach (7, 9)\n- If I go RIGHT first to (5, 8), then UP to (5, 9), then right twice to (7, 9) - same distance\n\nBoth paths are 4 moves to (7, 9).\n\nThe enemy at (9, 8) will likely go LEFT to grab (8, 8). After that, they might go UP to (8, 9) then LEFT to (7, 9). That would take them 3 moves to reach (7, 9) if they don't eat the apple at (8, 8) first... wait, they will eat it, so they'd be at (8, 8) after turn 1, then could go to (8, 9) on turn 2, then (7, 9) on turn 3.\n\nSo if I go UP now (turn 0\u21921), I'm at (4, 9)\nTurn 1\u21922: RIGHT to (5, 9)\nTurn 2\u21923: RIGHT to (6, 9)\nTurn 3\u21924: RIGHT to (7, 9) - I get the apple on turn 3\n\nEnemy:\nTurn 0\u21921: LEFT to (8, 8) - gets apple\nTurn 1\u21922: UP to (8, 9)\nTurn 2\u21923: LEFT to (7, 9) - would get apple on turn 2\n\nWait, that means enemy could reach (7, 9) on turn 2 (0-indexed: after 3 moves), and I'd reach it on turn 3 (after 4 moves). So enemy would get there first.\n\nActually let me recount. From (9, 8):\n- Move 1: LEFT to (8, 8) - gets apple\n- Move 2: UP to (8, 9)\n- Move 3: LEFT to (7, 9)\n\nFrom (4, 8):\n- Move 1: UP to (4, 9)\n- Move 2: RIGHT to (5, 9)\n- Move 3: RIGHT to (6, 9)\n- Move 4: RIGHT to (7, 9)\n\nYes, enemy would reach (7, 9) one turn before me if they go that route. But they might also go for (9, 6) after (8, 8).\n\nActually, the apple at (0, 9) might be a better target since the enemy is on the right side of the board. Let me think about that path:\n\nFrom (4, 8) to (0, 9):\n- Move 1: UP to (4, 9)\n- Move 2: LEFT to (3, 9)\n- Move 3: LEFT to (2, 9)\n- Move 4: LEFT to (1, 9)\n- Move 5: LEFT to (0, 9) - get apple\n\nThat's 5 moves, but the enemy is far from (0, 9).\n\nHmm, maybe I should go UP to get to row 9 and then decide based on what the enemy does. Going UP keeps both (0, 9) and (7, 9) accessible.\n\nLet me go UP to (4, 9) this turn. This positions me well to either go left toward (0, 9) or right toward (7, 9) depending on what the enemy does.\n\nStrategy note: After going UP, assess enemy movement. If enemy goes for (8, 8) then (7, 9), pivot to (0, 9). Otherwise, contest (7, 9).\n\nUP\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\nMy head is at (4, 8). Let me evaluate each move:\n\n**Safety check:**\n- UP (4, 9): Safe - empty cell\n- DOWN (4, 7): Safe - empty cell\n- LEFT (3, 8): Safe - empty cell\n- RIGHT (5, 8): Safe - empty cell\n\nAll four moves are safe this turn.\n\n**Apple analysis:**\nApples are at: (7, 9), (0, 9), (8, 8), (2, 3), (9, 6)\n\nThe enemy snake at (9, 8) is just 1 step from the apple at (8, 8) - they'll likely grab it immediately.\n\nFrom my position (4, 8):\n- (7, 9): 4 moves away (3 right, 1 up)\n- (0, 9): 5 moves away (4 left, 1 up)\n- (8, 8): 4 moves away, but enemy gets it first\n- (2, 3): 7 moves away\n\n**Strategic thinking:**\nGoing UP to (4, 9) puts me on the top row with good options - I can then decide to go LEFT toward (0, 9) which is uncontested, or RIGHT toward (7, 9). The enemy will likely grab (8, 8) then potentially go for (7, 9), making (0, 9) a safer target for me.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Go UP now to row 9, then evaluate. If enemy heads toward (7, 9), commit to (0, 9). The top-left apple is isolated from the enemy's likely path.\n\nUP",
