If I move DOWN now, I\u2019m one step closer to chomping it on the next turn and snowballing my apple count.  \n- LEFT (to (8,5)) doesn\u2019t hit an apple immediately and keeps me stuck a bit farther from the low\u2011hanging fruit on the right side.  \n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy proximity check**  \n- Snake\u202f#0 is way over on the left at (1,1). Its next move will probably stay near the left edge, so (9,4) and (8,5) are both safe from a head\u2011on collision.  \n\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 Future options**  \n- After a DOWN move I can still choose LEFT, DOWN again (to snag (9,3)), or even RIGHT later if I clear a path.  \n- After a LEFT move I\u2019m limited to UP (illegal), DOWN, or further LEFT \u2013 but UP is still deadly because (9,6) is my own body. So DOWN opens more branches.  \n\n**Bottom line:** Going DOWN not only keeps me alive, it pushes me toward an immediate apple bite and leaves the board wide open for future growth while staying far from the rival\u2019s path.  \n\nDOWN",

After a LEFT, I\u2019m stuck at (8,3) with no immediate apple and a narrower path upward.  \n\n**5\ufe0f\u20e3 Aggressive vibe** \u2013 I want to dominate the board, not wander aimlessly. Snatching that low\u2011hanging apple now gives me momentum and keeps the rival far from my trail.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Plan for the next few turns:**  \n- Grab (9,2) apple NOW with DOWN.  \n- Then aim for (8,2) or (9,1) to keep the growth spurt rolling.  \n- Stay on the right side, avoid the left wall, and watch the enemy slide past us.  \n\nDOWN",
