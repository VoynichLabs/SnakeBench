Moving right would be to (7, 0).\n   - Check if (7, 0) is safe:\n     - Valid board position\n     - Not on enemy body\n     - Not on own body\n     - Moving backwards (since tail is none, moving right would be backwards)\n   - **Not safe** (would hit own body).\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Let's clarify directions:\n\n- **UP**: Increase y-coordinate (from 0 to 1)\n- **DOWN**: Decrease y-coordinate (from 0 to -1, which is invalid)\n- **LEFT**: Decrease x-coordinate (from 6 to 5)\n- **RIGHT**: Increase x-coordinate (from 6 to 7)\n\nSo:\n\n- **UP**: (6, 0) -> (6, 1)\n  - Valid, safe, no immediate danger.\n\n- **DOWN**: (6, 0) -> (5, 0)\n  - Valid, safe, no immediate danger.\n\n- **LEFT**: (6, 0) -> (5, 0)\n  - Wait, no, LEFT is decreasing x-coordinate, so (6, 0) -> (5, 0)\n  - Same as DOWN, which is invalid because moving left from (6,0) is backwards.\n\nWait, no, moving LEFT from (6,0) is to (5,0), which is not backwards. Backwards would be moving in the same direction as the previous move, but since there's no previous move, it's ambiguous. However, the rule states \"moving directly backwards into your own body,\" which is ambiguous for a single segment snake. But logically, moving left from (6,0) is safe.\n\nWait, let's clarify the rule: \"moving directly backwards into your own body\" means if you move in the opposite direction of the previous move. Since there is no previous move, we assume no backward movement is dangerous. So LEFT is safe.\n\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 0) -> (7, 0)\n  - Valid, safe, no immediate danger.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves:\n\n1. **UP**: (6, 1)\n   - Check if (6,1) is safe:\n     - Valid board position\n     - No enemy body\n     - No own body\n     - Safe.\n   - Next turn, snake will be at (6,1) with no body. Next move options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n   - Apples nearby: (7,9) is far, (4,7) is far, (1,9) is far, (0,4) is far, (8,4) is far.\n   - No immediate apple nearby, but moving up opens more space.\n\n2. **LEFT**: (5, 0)\n   - Check if (5,0) is safe:\n     - Valid board position\n     - No enemy body\n     - No own body\n     - Safe.\n   - Next turn, snake will be at (5,0) with no body.\n   - Apples nearby: (0,4) is far, (8,4) is far, (7,9) is far, (4,7) is far, (1,9) is far.\n   - Moving left opens more space to the left.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: (7, 0)\n   - Check if (7,0) is safe:\n     - Valid board position\n     - No enemy body\n     - No own body\n     - Safe.\n   - Next turn, snake will be at (7,0) with no body.\n   - Apples nearby: (8,4) is close, but not directly adjacent.\n\n### Enemy Movement:\nEnemy snake is at (2,9). Next turn, it can move to any adjacent cell: (1,9), (2,8), (3,9), (2,10) invalid, (3,9) invalid, etc.\nPossible next positions: (1,9), (2,8), (3,9) invalid, (2,0) invalid.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\nThe closest apple to our current head is (8,4), which is far away. The next closest is (0,4), (4,7), etc.\n\n### Strategy:\n- We should avoid immediate collisions with the enemy snake.\n- Moving UP or LEFT seems safer and opens more space.\n- Moving RIGHT is slightly closer to an apple but less safe in the long run.\n\n### Long-term Plan:\n- Move UP to (6,1) to open up the board and avoid immediate danger.\n- Next turn, consider moving LEFT to (5,1) to explore the left side.\n- Keep an eye on enemy movement and avoid direct paths.\n\n### Final Decision:\n**UP**\n\n(Reasoning: Moving UP opens the board and avoids immediate danger while keeping options open for future moves.)",

A . . . (Apple at (7,9))\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 7: . . . . A . . . . . (Apple at (4,7))\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . A (Apple at (0,4))\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 4: A . . . . . . .

(Enemy head at (1,8), body at (1,9))\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n*(Note: (0,4) is at row 6, column 4, but the board numbering is inverted in the printed grid. Clarifying: (0,4) is row 6, column 4, but the grid shows it as row 6, column 4, which is correct. The grid is printed with y=9 at the top, y=0 at the bottom, so (0,4) is row 6, column 4.)*\n\n---\n\n### **Safe Moves and Risks**\nYour current head is at (6,1). The four possible moves are:\n\n1. **LEFT to (5,1)**\n   - Valid: No enemy or own body in this cell.\n   - Rationale: Expands horizontally leftward, reducing collision risk with the enemy (who is at (1,8) and may move toward the bottom-left). Avoids tight spaces near (6,2) and opens a path toward the (0,4) apple if pivoted later.\n\n2. **UP to (6,2)**\n   - Valid: No immediate danger (enemy is far, and no own body).\n   - Risk: The enemy\u2019s head at (1,8) could move toward the bottom-left in future turns, potentially threatening (6,2) if we\u2019re not careful. Also, the snake\u2019s body is empty, but long-term risk exists if the enemy corners us.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (7,1)**\n   - Valid: No immediate danger.\n   - Rationale: Neutral but doesn\u2019t advance toward apples or reduce enemy threat. The enemy is far to the top-left, so this move doesn\u2019t immediately help.\n\n4. **DOWN to (7,0)**\n   - Invalid: Off the board (y=0 is the bottom row, and moving down from (6,1) would go to (7,0), which is outside the 0-9 range). This move is deadly.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan for Next 3 Turns**\n**Turn 3 (Head at (5,1)):**\n- Prioritize **LEFT to (4,1)** to push further left and reduce enemy threat. If no immediate threats, consider **UP to (4,2)** to explore upward while keeping the snake\u2019s reach wide.\n\n**Turn 4:**\n- If the (0,4) apple is reachable in 2 moves (e.g., (4,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,4)), prioritize that path. Otherwise, keep expanding leftward or pivoting upward cautiously.\n\n**Key Strategy:**\n- Avoid tight spaces near the enemy\u2019s potential path (e.g., (6,2) is risky if the enemy moves aggressively).\n- Prioritize moves that keep the snake\u2019s body spread out and reduce collision risk with the enemy.\n- If an apple is reachable in 2-3 moves, chase it aggressively but avoid getting trapped.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move: UP**\n*(Note: The previous rationale suggested LEFT, but UP is now chosen because it opens a safer upward path toward the (4,7) apple while keeping the snake\u2019s body in a more open configuration. The enemy\u2019s threat is mitigated by spreading out.)*\n\n**Word:** UP",

The apple at (0, 4) is at row 6, column 4.)*\n\n---\n\n### **Safe Moves and Risks**\nYour current head is at **(5, 2)**. Possible moves:\n\n1. **LEFT to (4, 2)**\n   - Valid: No enemy or own body in this cell.\n   - Rationale: Expands leftward, reducing collision risk with the enemy (who is at (1, 8) and may move toward the bottom-left). Opens a path toward the **(0, 4) apple** if pivoted later. Avoids tight spaces near (5, 1) and (5, 3).\n\n2. **UP to (5, 3)**\n   - Valid: No immediate danger.\n   - Risk: The enemy\u2019s head at (1, 8) could move toward the bottom-left in future turns, potentially threatening (5, 3) if we\u2019re not careful. Also, the snake\u2019s body is empty, but long-term risk exists if the enemy corners us.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (6, 2)**\n   - Valid: No immediate danger.\n   - Rationale: Neutral but doesn\u2019t advance toward apples or reduce enemy threat. The enemy is far to the top-left, so this move doesn\u2019t immediately help.\n\n4. **DOWN to (6, 1)**\n   - Valid: No immediate danger.\n   - Rationale: Moves toward the bottom, which could be useful for reaching the **(0, 4) apple** if pivoted correctly. However, the enemy\u2019s body at (1, 9) could interfere if we don\u2019t plan carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan for Next 3 Turns**\n**Turn 4 (Head at (4, 2) or (5, 3)):**\n- **Prioritize LEFT to (4, 2)** to push further left and reduce enemy threat. If no immediate threats, consider **UP to (4, 3)** to explore upward while keeping the snake\u2019s reach wide.\n- **Goal:** Reach the **(0, 4) apple** in 2-3 moves by moving left/down toward the bottom-left.\n\n**Turn 5:**\n- If the snake reaches **(3, 2)**, pivot **LEFT to (2, 2)** or **DOWN to (3, 1)** to continue toward **(0, 4)**.\n- If the enemy moves aggressively, pivot **UP to (4, 3)** to avoid collision.\n\n**Key Strategy:**\n- Avoid tight spaces near the enemy\u2019s potential path (e.g., (5, 1) is risky if the enemy moves toward the bottom-left).\n- Prioritize moves that keep the snake\u2019s body spread out and reduce collision risk with the enemy.\n- If an apple is reachable in 2-3 moves, chase it aggressively but avoid getting trapped.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move: LEFT**\n*(Prioritizing leftward expansion to reduce enemy threat and open a path toward the **(0, 4) apple**.)*\n\n**LEFT**",

The enemy (`Snake #0`) is at `(4, 6)` with a body extending to `(4, 7)` and `(3, 7)`. The apples are at `(7,9)`, `(0,4)`, `(8,4)`, `(9,6)`, and `(4,7)` (though `(4,7)` is occupied by Snake #0\u2019s body).\n\n#### **Safety First**\n- **Immediate threats:**\n  - Snake #0\u2019s head is at `(4,6)`, body at `(4,7)` and `(3,7)`. If it moves **UP** to `(4,5)` or **LEFT** to `(3,6)`, it could collide with your head if you move **UP** or **LEFT** in the same turn.\n  - If you move **UP** to `(3,1)`, Snake #0\u2019s head at `(4,6)` could move **UP** to `(4,5)` and then **LEFT** to `(3,5)` in the next turn, eventually cornering you.\n  - Moving **DOWN** to `(4,0)` is safe because Snake #0 is not moving vertically (its body is at `(4,7)` and `(3,7)`), and it won\u2019t block your path.\n  - Moving **LEFT** to `(2,0)` is risky because Snake #0\u2019s head at `(4,6)` could move **LEFT** to `(3,6)` in the next turn, blocking your path if you pivot later.\n\n#### **Apple Proximity**\n- The closest apples are `(0,4)` (~4 moves away) and `(8,4)` (~4 moves away). Moving **DOWN** expands your reach toward `(0,4)` while keeping options open.\n\n#### **Enemy Behavior**\n- Snake #0\u2019s body is aligned vertically (`(4,7)` and `(3,7)`), suggesting it may move **UP** or **LEFT** next. Avoiding **UP** or **LEFT** now prevents future collisions.\n\n#### **Follow-Up Moves**\n- If you move **DOWN**, your next move could be **LEFT** to `(2,0)` or **RIGHT** to `(5,0)` to explore the board. This keeps flexibility.\n\n### **Final Move: DOWN**\n*(Your snake will move to `(4,0)`.)*",
