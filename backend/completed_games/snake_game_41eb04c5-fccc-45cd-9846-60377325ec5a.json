My noggin is perched at (9,5) with a body that climbs up to (9,8) and then stretches left to (8,8).  \n\n- **UP** would slam straight into my own neck (9,6) \u2013 instant KO, so NOPE.  \n- **RIGHT** rockets me off the board (10,5) \u2013 RIP.  \n- **DOWN** drops me to (9,4) \u2013 that\u2019s an apple waiting for me, hello +1 length and +1 point! \ud83c\udf4e  \n- **LEFT** shuffles me to (8,5) \u2013 safe but no immediate apple in sight.  \n\n\ud83e\udd14 Which move fuels growth *and* keeps my options wide open?  \n\nThe enemy\u2019s head is at (6,4) and can only venture RIGHT, UP or DOWN. None of those steps land on (9,4) or (8,5), so no direct head\u2011on collision risk. Still, I should stay wary of them slithering into my new head spot after they move.  \n\nIf I **DOWN** now:  \n- I eat the (9,4) apple \u2192 grow longer and boost my score.  \n- My new tail will be at (9,5), leaving me with safe exits **DOWN** to (9,3) and **LEFT** to (8,4) next turn \u2013 still multiple safe pathways, no box\u2011in risk.  \n\nIf I **LEFT** now:  \n- No apple now, just a shuffle to (8,5).  \n- I keep my length but miss a quick content bite, and I\u2019m a step farther from the big apples up top.  \n\nSo the clear win\u2011win is to **DOWN**, snatch that apple, grow, and keep the pressure on Snake\u202f#1.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f PLAN:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Move DOWN to (9,4) \u2192 eat apple, +1 length.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn, swing LEFT toward (8,4) while staying ready to dip DOWN again for (7,0) or climb up to (9,9).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep the enemy pinned on the left edge, forcing them into my expanding body.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Stay aggressive, avoid the top wall, and chase high\u2011value apples.  \n\nDOWN",
