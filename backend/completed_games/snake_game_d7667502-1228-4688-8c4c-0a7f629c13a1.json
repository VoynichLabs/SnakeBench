Their legal moves this turn are likely **UP (6,\u202f6)**, **DOWN (6,\u202f4)** or **LEFT (5,\u202f5)** (which also contains an apple). None of those intersect my immediate options, so a head\u2011on collision this turn is impossible.\n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Why UP is the killer move**\n\n1. **Apple chain** \u2013 (2,\u202f8) and (2,\u202f9) sit right above me. Snag both in two turns, grow by\u202f2, and push my score to\u202f10 while the rival lags at\u202f4.  \n2. **Space creation** \u2013 climbing the left wall keeps me on a narrow corridor that the opponent can\u2019t cut off from the right side. After the double\u2011apple boost I\u2019ll swing left\u2011ward, wall\u2011hug the opponent and force him into a dead\u2011end.  \n3. **Safety** \u2013 UP is completely free of bodies, walls, and opponent heads. It leaves LEFT and RIGHT still open for future wiggle\u2011room, so I won\u2019t trap myself.  \n4. **Aggression** \u2013 By ballooning my length early I can later use my own tail as a moving wall, making any head\u2011on attempt from the rival suicidal for him.\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Short\u2011term plan (next few turns)**  \n1. **Turn\u202f24** \u2013 **UP** to (2,\u202f8) \u2192 eat apple, grow.  \n2. **Turn\u202f25** \u2013 **UP** again to (2,\u202f9) \u2192 eat second apple, grow.  \n3. **Turn\u202f26** \u2013 **LEFT** to (1,\u202f9) and start hugging the top\u2011left corner, cutting off any path the opponent might take toward the upper board.  \n4. Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s left\u2011ward push; once his head gets close to column\u202f5 I\u2019ll swing down\u2011right to trap him against the wall.\n\nNo matter what the rival does, moving **UP** right now maximizes apple gain, preserves escape routes, and sets me up to dominate the board.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Execution**\n\nUP",

Their legal moves this turn are **UP (4,\u202f6)**, **DOWN (4,\u202f4)** (apple), or **LEFT (3,\u202f5)**. None target my two safe squares, so a head\u2011on collision is impossible right now.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Why moving RIGHT is the sweet spot**\n\n1. **Stay alive** \u2013 both LEFT and RIGHT are safe; I pick the one that maximizes future mobility.  \n2. **Open the board** \u2013 heading RIGHT puts me deeper into the central column (x\u202f=\u202f3) where a bunch of apples sit (`(4,4)`, `(5,3)`, `(5,1)`, \u2026). I\u2019ll have a clear path to chase them and keep my lead growing.  \n3. **Pressure the rival** \u2013 the opponent is sandwiched between its own tail on the right wall and my future corridor from the top. By moving RIGHT I can snake down the middle and cut off any escape route he might try toward the left side.  \n4. **Avoid dead\u2011ends** \u2013 staying on the extreme left edge would quickly turn into a narrow tunnel. RIGHT keeps my options wide (down, left later, or even another right swing) and reduces the risk of self\u2011trapping.  \n\n**\ud83d\udccb Short\u2011term plan (next few turns)**  \n\n1. **Turn\u202f26** \u2013 **RIGHT** to (3,\u202f9).  \n2. **Turn\u202f27** \u2013 likely **DOWN** into (3,\u202f8) to start descending toward the apple cluster at y\u202f\u2248\u202f4\u20115.  \n3. Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s move to (4,\u202f4) (apple) \u2013 I\u2019ll be ready to block his path or force a head\u2011on when my score is higher.  \n\n**\u2705 Bottom line** \u2013 the safest, most aggressive, and space\u2011preserving move is **RIGHT**.  \n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s two points in three turns, extending our lead to 14\u201112.  \n3. **Space control** \u2013 holding column\u202f8 lets us later slide right onto (9,\u202f8) if we wish, or swing left to close the opponent into the lower\u2011left maze.  \n4. **Opponent distraction** \u2013 the rival\u2019s head at (8,\u202f1) is far away and will likely chase the apple at (9,\u202f1). They can\u2019t contest our column\u20118 run.\n\n**\ud83d\udccb Short\u2011term plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f34**: **DOWN** to (8,\u202f8).  \n- **Turn\u202f35**: **DOWN** to (8,\u202f7) \u2192 eat apple, grow.  \n- **Turn\u202f36**: **DOWN** to (8,\u202f6) \u2192 eat another apple, grow.  \n- From there we can decide to swing right to (9,\u202f6) or keep descending, keeping the opponent trapped in the lower\u2011left quadrant.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the momentum and lock down those apples!  \n\nDOWN",

They can only sprint **UP** to (9,3) or **LEFT** to (8,2). Neither of those squares is (8,6), so a head\u2011on collision is impossible this turn.\n\n**Future safety** \u2013 after we drop down onto the apple, we\u2019ll have:\n- **Up** = our old head (now body) \u2013 blocked, but that\u2019s fine.  \n- **Down** = (8,5) empty.  \n- **Left** = (7,6) empty.  \n- **Right** = (9,6) empty.  \n\nThree fresh, safe directions keep us flexible and let us start shaping a trap for the rival later on.\n\n**Bottom line:** Grab the apple, stay alive, keep options open, and keep the pressure on the enemy.

By snaking left we\u2019ll be able to drop down to (6,7) on the next turn, eat the apple, grow, and then solidify a barrier that the opponent can\u2019t slip through without crashing into our body.\n\n**Opponent\u2019s options** from head **(9,4)**:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (9,5) (empty)  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,4) (empty)\n\nNeither of those squares collides with our planned move, so we stay alive.  \nIf the rival goes **LEFT** into (8,4) we\u2019ll already be in position to block the column\u20118 corridor on the next couple of turns, forcing him toward the dead\u2011end at the bottom\u2011right corner (9,0\u20112).  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan** after this move:\n1. On the next turn head up to **(6,7)** and grab the apple (grow +1).  \n2. Continue hugging column\u202f8 and then snake down the left side of it, sealing the opponent in the right\u2011most strip.  \n3. When the opponent is forced into the corner, look for a head\u2011on clash \u2013 we have the higher score (15\u202fvs\u202f13) so a direct collision would win us the round.\n\n**Decision:** go left, take the apple route, and start boxing the rival.  \n\n**Move:**  \nLEFT",
