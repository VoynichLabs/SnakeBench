I need to find the best apple to go for, considering the proximity of Snake #0.\n\nThe apple at (0, 1) is very close to my current position. Going there could be risky because Snake #0 is at (8, 4), potentially creating a collision if I move horizontally.  The apple at (1, 6) is also relatively close but further away in the y direction than the apple at (0,1). The apple at (2,1) is also close to my current x coordinate. The apple at (5, 8) requires a significant move upwards and right. The apple at (0, 7) also is a bit further away.\n\nGiven Snake #0's position, I'll prioritize moving towards (0, 1). I will move up to the apple at (1,6) instead of directly to (0,1) because it will allow me to have space from Snake #0.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue to prioritize apples that are not directly in Snake #0's path.\n\nNext move: UP",
