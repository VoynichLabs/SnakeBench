The apples are at:\n\n- (5,5)\n- (0,5)\n- (2,5)\n- (6,7)\n- (9,1)\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7,6) with body at (7,5).\n\nAnalyzing the board and your location:\n\n- Your head is at (3,9).\n- Your body is at (4,9), so moving right (back to 4,9) would be moving onto your body—this is forbidden.\n- Moving left to (2,9) is in bounds and not occupied.\n- Moving up would be to (3,10), which is off the board.\n- Moving down to (3,8) is free and on the board.\n\nThere is no apple at (3,9) (the last note mentions moving left to (3,9) to eat an apple, but the apple positions given don't show one at (3,9)). So no apple directly here.\n\nGiven your last move was LEFT, and you are currently at (3,9), your current goal was to move left towards an apple at (3,9) previously, but no apple is located there; apples are at (2,5), (0,5), (5,5), (6,7), and (9,1).\n\nSo perhaps there was a misunderstanding: you thought there was an apple at (3,9), but there is none.\n\nImportant to adjust the plan: the closest apples now are on row 5: (0,5), (2,5), and (5,5).\n\nYour snake is currently on row 9; y=9.\n\nTo reach the apples, you'd want to go down from 9 to 5, then left or right to the apple.\n\nAlso, (6,7) is closer in y coordinate to you (at y=7), and you could consider grabbing that apple too.\n\nLet's check possible moves from (3,9):\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,9)\n- Move RIGHT to (4,9) (your body is here; forbidden)\n- Move UP to (3,10) (off board)\n- Move DOWN to (3,8)\n\nMoving left to (2,9) is legal, and moves you closer to x=2 where apple (2,5) is located.\n\nMoving down to (3,8) moves you closer in y to the apples at y=5.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nA strategy could be:\n\n- Move DOWN toward row 5, then go left to (2,5) or (0,5), or right to (5,5).\n\nRegarding dangers:\n\n- Enemy snake is at (7,6) with body at (7,5), near the (6,7) apple. That's contested; better to avoid that for now.\n\n- Your body at (4,9) means no danger to left or down moves.\n\nSo planning:\n\nIf you move DOWN to (3,8), then next moves can continue down to row 5, then go left and get apples at (2,5) or (0,5).\n\nIf you move LEFT to (2,9), you get closer horizontally, but remain on y=9, and need to move down later anyway.\n\nI think moving DOWN to get closer vertically to the apples on row 5 makes sense as a next step.\n\nAlso, moving left leads you away from your own body, but positioned at (2,9), you will need to move DOWN anyway to get to apples.\n\nHence, I will choose DOWN as next move to approach the apples generally.\n\n---\n\n**Next strategy:** Keep moving down to y=5, then move left to (2,5) or (0,5), then clear other apples.\n\n---\n\n**Decided move:** DOWN",
