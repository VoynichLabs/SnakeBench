However, that's also where the enemy snake is located (but wait, I see '1' there - that seems to be an enemy snake head, not an apple).\n\nWait, let me re-read more carefully:\nLooking at board row 1: \"A . . . . . . . . 0\" - so (0,1) has 'A', meaning an apple, and (9,1) has '0', meaning my head.\n\nThe apple positions are:\n- (3, 4) - Apple\n- (0, 1) - Apple  \n- (4, 0) - Apple\n- (3, 7) - Apple\n- (4, 9) - Apple\n\nMy position: (9, 1) \nEnemy position: (1, 3)\n\nMy main considerations:\n1. I can move LEFT to reach (8, 1) - no immediate danger, but not collecting an apple\n2. I can move DOWN to reach (9, 0) - there's an apple there at (4, 0) but that's not immediately helpful\n3. I can move LEFT to (8, 1) - safe and could set up future moves\n4. I can move DOWN to (9, 0), but then I'm vulnerable since I'll be in the lower portion and there's still an apple far away.\n\nActually, looking again at the (0,1) position, that has an apple. To reach it, I must move LEFT. That would take me from (9,1) to (8,1). This doesn't put me adjacent to the enemy snake.\n\nI have a couple of good options:\n1. Moving LEFT to (8,1) - this puts me near some open space\n2. Moving DOWN to (9,0) - gets me closer to (4,0) apple\n\nI should try to collect a nearby apple rather than going for very distant ones. The apple at (0,1) is directly to my left, though I'd move past it if I go LEFT to (8,1). I need to go LEFT and land on (0,1) to get that apple.\n\nLet me recalculate my current valid moves from (9,1):\n\n- LEFT: to (8,1) - safe, but doesn't get me apple (0,1) unless I continue after eating it\n- DOWN: to (9,0) - safe\n- UP: to (9,2) - safe  \n- RIGHT: to (10,1) - OUT OF BOUNDS\n\nSo RIGHT is immediately fatal.\n\nFrom current position (9,1), LEFT leads to (8,1), UP to (9,2), DOWN to (9,0).\n\nLooking toward apples:\n- Apple at (0,1) requires moving LEFT 9 times (which would be 9 steps through empty space)  \n- Apple at (3,4) - requires moving left, then up\n- Apple at (4,0) - requires moving left, then down\n- Apple at (3,7) - requires moving left then up\n- Apple at (4,9) - requires moving left, then up\n\nLet me consider what apple is most beneficial:\n1. (0,1) is close but requires very precise movement\n2. The closest strategic apple would be (3,4) (in terms of getting more distance from snake) but that's further\n3. Actually, I see (4,0) apple which is within reasonable range \n\nLooking at the layout carefully:\n(9,1) is positioned almost at the right edge with clear path to (8,1).\nThe apple at (0,1) is only reachable by going left all the way to (0,1). But we also see that we can move to (8,1), (9,0), or (9,2) safely.\n\nActually, let's step back. The apple at (0,1) is directly west of us! We have:\n\n(0,1) | (1,1) | (2,1) | (3,1) | ... | (8,1) | (9,1) \nA     | .     | .     | .     | ... | .     | 0 <- my head\n\nSo I could move LEFT 9 spaces to reach apple (0,1). \nThis means I could move LEFT nine times. \nBut each move takes one step.\n\nIf I move LEFT once: (9,1) -> (8,1)\nThen I can potentially get an apple at (0,1) eventually...\n\nWait, wait, let me reread more carefully the board.\n\nThe apples are at coordinates given: (3, 4), (0, 1), (4, 0), (3, 7), (4, 9)\n\nAnd I am at (9,1)\n\nLooking at positions, and reading from the board:\nRow 9: \"A . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 8: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 7: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 6: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 5: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 4: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 3: \" . 1 . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 2: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 1: \" A . . . . . . . . 0 \" \nRow 0: \" . . . . A . . . . . \"\n\nRow 1: A(0,1) [Apple] . . . . . . . . 0(9,1) - This shows that my head is at (9,1) and apple is at (0,1)\n\nSo to get the apple at (0,1), I need to move left many steps.\n\nActually, just moving LEFT 8 spaces takes me from (9,1) to (1,1). \n\nSo:\n- Move LEFT 8 times to get to (1,1)\n- Then move down from (1,1) to (1,0) \n- Then move LEFT to reach (0,0) \n\nThat isn't efficient. I can move LEFT once to (8,1) and then decide.\n\nLet's focus first on being safe. If I move LEFT to (8,1) and then look at paths, that places me in a good spot.\n\nAlso, if I can simply go LEFT once, I get to (8,1). From there, my options are:\n- Left to (7,1)\n- Up to (8,2) \n- Down to (8,0)\n\nNone look promising for immediate apple collection. There is an apple at (0,1), but we are trying to avoid going straight into the enemy snake location. Let's make sure:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,1), then the snake at (1,3) is now at a safer distance, and my position is open.\n\nThe most logical immediate safe move is to go LEFT to (8,1) because:\n- It is safe\n- It avoids touching enemy\n- Sets up possibilities for further navigation\n\nStrategy: Go LEFT to (8,1)\n\nActually let me check what happens if instead we move UP. I'd be at (9,2) - that's okay.\n\nHowever, let's check if there is anything that forces me to prioritize any specific route.\n\nWhat I really do want to do - get an apple without being too risky.\n\nGoing to (0,1) with a long left move... That\u2019s fine if it yields an apple.\n\nLet\u2019s say my goal is to approach the nearest apples efficiently. The apple at (0,1) is only reachable via 9 steps left, but that might be worth it if no immediate food. Let's say I move LEFT to (8,1). Then I can evaluate subsequent moves in the next turn. This seems like it keeps me alive AND gives an opening to explore.\n\nOr I can move UP. Then to (9,2).\n\nSo either (LEFT) or (UP).\n\nI think better to go LEFT once, to (8,1). This allows me to move away from potentially dangerous area (enemy at (1,3)) AND positions me well.\n\nMoving LEFT\n\nLEFT",

However, that's also where the enemy snake is located (but wait, I see '1' there - that seems to be an enemy snake head, not an apple).\n\nWait, let me re-read more carefully:\nLooking at board row 1: \"A . . . . . . . . 0\" - so (0,1) has 'A', meaning an apple, and (9,1) has '0', meaning my head.\n\nThe apple positions are:\n- (3, 4) - Apple\n- (0, 1) - Apple  \n- (4, 0) - Apple\n- (3, 7) - Apple\n- (4, 9) - Apple\n\nMy position: (9, 1) \nEnemy position: (1, 3)\n\nMy main considerations:\n1. I can move LEFT to reach (8, 1) - no immediate danger, but not collecting an apple\n2. I can move DOWN to reach (9, 0) - there's an apple there at (4, 0) but that's not immediately helpful\n3. I can move LEFT to (8, 1) - safe and could set up future moves\n4. I can move DOWN to (9, 0), but then I'm vulnerable since I'll be in the lower portion and there's still an apple far away.\n\nActually, looking again at the (0,1) position, that has an apple. To reach it, I must move LEFT. That would take me from (9,1) to (8,1). This doesn't put me adjacent to the enemy snake.\n\nI have a couple of good options:\n1. Moving LEFT to (8,1) - this puts me near some open space\n2. Moving DOWN to (9,0) - gets me closer to (4,0) apple\n\nI should try to collect a nearby apple rather than going for very distant ones. The apple at (0,1) is directly to my left, though I'd move past it if I go LEFT to (8,1). I need to go LEFT and land on (0,1) to get that apple.\n\nLet me recalculate my current valid moves from (9,1):\n\n- LEFT: to (8,1) - safe, but doesn't get me apple (0,1) unless I continue after eating it\n- DOWN: to (9,0) - safe\n- UP: to (9,2) - safe  \n- RIGHT: to (10,1) - OUT OF BOUNDS\n\nSo RIGHT is immediately fatal.\n\nFrom current position (9,1), LEFT leads to (8,1), UP to (9,2), DOWN to (9,0).\n\nLooking toward apples:\n- Apple at (0,1) requires moving LEFT 9 times (which would be 9 steps through empty space)  \n- Apple at (3,4) - requires moving left, then up\n- Apple at (4,0) - requires moving left, then down\n- Apple at (3,7) - requires moving left then up\n- Apple at (4,9) - requires moving left, then up\n\nLet me consider what apple is most beneficial:\n1. (0,1) is close but requires very precise movement\n2. The closest strategic apple would be (3,4) (in terms of getting more distance from snake) but that's further\n3. Actually, I see (4,0) apple which is within reasonable range \n\nLooking at the layout carefully:\n(9,1) is positioned almost at the right edge with clear path to (8,1).\nThe apple at (0,1) is only reachable by going left all the way to (0,1). But we also see that we can move to (8,1), (9,0), or (9,2) safely.\n\nActually, let's step back. The apple at (0,1) is directly west of us! We have:\n\n(0,1) | (1,1) | (2,1) | (3,1) | ... | (8,1) | (9,1) \nA     | .     | .     | .     | ... | .     | 0 <- my head\n\nSo I could move LEFT 9 spaces to reach apple (0,1). \nThis means I could move LEFT nine times. \nBut each move takes one step.\n\nIf I move LEFT once: (9,1) -> (8,1)\nThen I can potentially get an apple at (0,1) eventually...\n\nWait, wait, let me reread more carefully the board.\n\nThe apples are at coordinates given: (3, 4), (0, 1), (4, 0), (3, 7), (4, 9)\n\nAnd I am at (9,1)\n\nLooking at positions, and reading from the board:\nRow 9: \"A . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 8: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 7: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 6: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 5: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 4: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 3: \" . 1 . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 2: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 1: \" A . . . . . . . . 0 \" \nRow 0: \" . . . . A . . . . . \"\n\nRow 1: A(0,1) [Apple] . . . . . . . . 0(9,1) - This shows that my head is at (9,1) and apple is at (0,1)\n\nSo to get the apple at (0,1), I need to move left many steps.\n\nActually, just moving LEFT 8 spaces takes me from (9,1) to (1,1). \n\nSo:\n- Move LEFT 8 times to get to (1,1)\n- Then move down from (1,1) to (1,0) \n- Then move LEFT to reach (0,0) \n\nThat isn't efficient. I can move LEFT once to (8,1) and then decide.\n\nLet's focus first on being safe. If I move LEFT to (8,1) and then look at paths, that places me in a good spot.\n\nAlso, if I can simply go LEFT once, I get to (8,1). From there, my options are:\n- Left to (7,1)\n- Up to (8,2) \n- Down to (8,0)\n\nNone look promising for immediate apple collection. There is an apple at (0,1), but we are trying to avoid going straight into the enemy snake location. Let's make sure:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,1), then the snake at (1,3) is now at a safer distance, and my position is open.\n\nThe most logical immediate safe move is to go LEFT to (8,1) because:\n- It is safe\n- It avoids touching enemy\n- Sets up possibilities for further navigation\n\nStrategy: Go LEFT to (8,1)\n\nActually let me check what happens if instead we move UP. I'd be at (9,2) - that's okay.\n\nHowever, let's check if there is anything that forces me to prioritize any specific route.\n\nWhat I really do want to do - get an apple without being too risky.\n\nGoing to (0,1) with a long left move... That\u2019s fine if it yields an apple.\n\nLet\u2019s say my goal is to approach the nearest apples efficiently. The apple at (0,1) is only reachable via 9 steps left, but that might be worth it if no immediate food. Let's say I move LEFT to (8,1). Then I can evaluate subsequent moves in the next turn. This seems like it keeps me alive AND gives an opening to explore.\n\nOr I can move UP. Then to (9,2).\n\nSo either (LEFT) or (UP).\n\nI think better to go LEFT once, to (8,1). This allows me to move away from potentially dangerous area (enemy at (1,3)) AND positions me well.\n\nMoving LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Safety - avoiding immediate collision with the enemy\n2. Path to apples - maintaining flexibility to reach viable apples\n\nI noticed the enemy is at (3, 3), and my current spot (7, 1) puts me far from that position, so we're not immediately adjacent.\n\nGoing UP to (7, 2) seems like the most promising direction to expand my territory and set up for a better approach to higher-value apples.\n\nUP\n\nWait, let me reconsider the initial move because the game description says \"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game\" and shows the board as if you're moving from (7,1) already, so I am currently at (7,1) from the last frame.\n\nFrom this current position, let me see what would happen with the actual positions given.\n\nWait I need to be careful and read exactly what my snake head is at and what move was made.\n\nLooking at instruction block:\n\"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game...\"\n\nThen it shows boards with coordinates...\n\nThe last move log says:\nCurrent position: My snake head: (8, 1) \nbut now showing position:\nMy snake head: (7, 1)\n\nSo the system shows me:\n\"Your snake head:\" followed by \"(7, 1)\" \nThen says \"Current Board State...\"\n\nSo that means before making the move the head must have been at (8, 1), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nTherefore:\nAt the start of this turn: head at (7, 1)\n\nIf I go:\nUP -> (7, 2) - No apple, but keeps me in open area.\nDOWN -> (7, 0) - Gets to apple (4, 0) but that requires several moves.\nLEFT -> (6, 1) - Safe; might be necessary to avoid enemy later or for maneuver.\nRIGHT -> (8, 1) - returns to previous position with no gains.\n\nLooking at the apples relative to current position:\n- Apple (3, 4): that\u2019s up and left\n- Apple (0, 1): to the immediate left \n- Apple (4, 0): down and right  \n- Apple (3, 7): up and left  \n- Apple (4, 9): up and right  \n\nFor immediate tactical benefit from (7,1):\n\nSince my previous rationale said I moved LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1) \u2014 so I started at (8,1) and ended at (7,1).\n\nFrom (7,1):\n\nA smart next move would aim to avoid trapping myself while keeping access to several apple areas. \nOptionally, going toward the apple nearest to my position but still strategic in terms of future movement.\n\nFrom (7, 1):\n\nRIGHT leads to (8,1) - that\u2019s just returning to the last spot  \nLEFT leads to (6,1) - safe move that expands the horizontal space around me  \nUP leads to (7,2) - maintains vertical position to look for apple or room to grow\nDOWN leads to (7,0) - goes towards apple at (4,0), but not very direct \n\nThe safest and most flexible approach is probably:\nLEFT to (6,1)\n\nLEFT\n\nWait... \nThis is the game state: \"Your snake head: (7, 1)\" \n\nThat indicates we are ALREADY at (7, 1).\nThe statement **START LAST MOVE PICK** had a prior move that resulted in us ending at (7,1). \n\nIf the previous state had the head at (8,1) and we moved LEFT to get to (7,1), then we were at (8,1) previously and moved LEFT (decreasing x).\n\nNow considering the board again, from (7,1), there are four possible directions:\n- UP: (7,2)\n- DOWN: (7,0)\n- LEFT: (6,1) \n- RIGHT: (8,1)\n\nWe could consider:\n- Going UP (7,2) would be safer long term than DOWN toward (7,0) where apple (4,0) sits. \n- Going RIGHT (8,1) brings no gain vs staying at (7,1)\n- Going DOWN (7,0) gets to apple (4,0) but is a longer path\n- Going LEFT (6,1) opens up left-side area\n\nLooking ahead, if the snake continues to grow, moving LEFT gives me more horizontal space in case I need to move later without crossing my own body.\n\nBut there's an enemy at (3,3). If I go LEFT to (6,1) and then move UP or DOWN I am not in imminent contact.\n\nLet me evaluate apple proximity.  \nCurrent: At (7,1).\nNext apple in line closest is (0,1), directly left at distance of 7 squares. That requires 7 consecutive left moves before eating it!\n\nBut it's actually a better idea to move in such a way as to avoid being too constrained.\n\nThe strategic option is to go towards one of the more open paths or the apples with greater accessibility without locking oneself in.\n\nGoing LEFT to (6,1) seems to be giving me the most freedom, especially since I don't yet know where exactly the enemy will move and I don\u2019t want to go into restricted territory.\n\nLEFT",

I need to go LEFT and land on (0,1) to get that apple.\n\nLet me recalculate my current valid moves from (9,1):\n\n- LEFT: to (8,1) - safe, but doesn't get me apple (0,1) unless I continue after eating it\n- DOWN: to (9,0) - safe\n- UP: to (9,2) - safe  \n- RIGHT: to (10,1) - OUT OF BOUNDS\n\nSo RIGHT is immediately fatal.\n\nFrom current position (9,1), LEFT leads to (8,1), UP to (9,2), DOWN to (9,0).\n\nLooking toward apples:\n- Apple at (0,1) requires moving LEFT 9 times (which would be 9 steps through empty space)  \n- Apple at (3,4) - requires moving left, then up\n- Apple at (4,0) - requires moving left, then down\n- Apple at (3,7) - requires moving left then up\n- Apple at (4,9) - requires moving left, then up\n\nLet me consider what apple is most beneficial:\n1. (0,1) is close but requires very precise movement\n2. The closest strategic apple would be (3,4) (in terms of getting more distance from snake) but that's further\n3. Actually, I see (4,0) apple which is within reasonable range \n\nLooking at the layout carefully:\n(9,1) is positioned almost at the right edge with clear path to (8,1).\nThe apple at (0,1) is only reachable by going left all the way to (0,1). But we also see that we can move to (8,1), (9,0), or (9,2) safely.\n\nActually, let's step back. The apple at (0,1) is directly west of us! We have:\n\n(0,1) | (1,1) | (2,1) | (3,1) | ... | (8,1) | (9,1) \nA     | .     | .     | .     | ... | .     | 0 <- my head\n\nSo I could move LEFT 9 spaces to reach apple (0,1). \nThis means I could move LEFT nine times. \nBut each move takes one step.\n\nIf I move LEFT once: (9,1) -> (8,1)\nThen I can potentially get an apple at (0,1) eventually...\n\nWait, wait, let me reread more carefully the board.\n\nThe apples are at coordinates given: (3, 4), (0, 1), (4, 0), (3, 7), (4, 9)\n\nAnd I am at (9,1)\n\nLooking at positions, and reading from the board:\nRow 9: \"A . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 8: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 7: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 6: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 5: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 4: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 3: \" . 1 . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 2: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 1: \" A . . . . . . . . 0 \" \nRow 0: \" . . . . A . . . . . \"\n\nRow 1: A(0,1) [Apple] . . . . . . . . 0(9,1) - This shows that my head is at (9,1) and apple is at (0,1)\n\nSo to get the apple at (0,1), I need to move left many steps.\n\nActually, just moving LEFT 8 spaces takes me from (9,1) to (1,1). \n\nSo:\n- Move LEFT 8 times to get to (1,1)\n- Then move down from (1,1) to (1,0) \n- Then move LEFT to reach (0,0) \n\nThat isn't efficient. I can move LEFT once to (8,1) and then decide.\n\nLet's focus first on being safe. If I move LEFT to (8,1) and then look at paths, that places me in a good spot.\n\nAlso, if I can simply go LEFT once, I get to (8,1). From there, my options are:\n- Left to (7,1)\n- Up to (8,2) \n- Down to (8,0)\n\nNone look promising for immediate apple collection. There is an apple at (0,1), but we are trying to avoid going straight into the enemy snake location. Let's make sure:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,1), then the snake at (1,3) is now at a safer distance, and my position is open.\n\nThe most logical immediate safe move is to go LEFT to (8,1) because:\n- It is safe\n- It avoids touching enemy\n- Sets up possibilities for further navigation\n\nStrategy: Go LEFT to (8,1)\n\nActually let me check what happens if instead we move UP. I'd be at (9,2) - that's okay.\n\nHowever, let's check if there is anything that forces me to prioritize any specific route.\n\nWhat I really do want to do - get an apple without being too risky.\n\nGoing to (0,1) with a long left move... That\u2019s fine if it yields an apple.\n\nLet\u2019s say my goal is to approach the nearest apples efficiently. The apple at (0,1) is only reachable via 9 steps left, but that might be worth it if no immediate food. Let's say I move LEFT to (8,1). Then I can evaluate subsequent moves in the next turn. This seems like it keeps me alive AND gives an opening to explore.\n\nOr I can move UP. Then to (9,2).\n\nSo either (LEFT) or (UP).\n\nI think better to go LEFT once, to (8,1). This allows me to move away from potentially dangerous area (enemy at (1,3)) AND positions me well.\n\nMoving LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Safety - avoiding immediate collision with the enemy\n2. Path to apples - maintaining flexibility to reach viable apples\n\nI noticed the enemy is at (3, 3), and my current spot (7, 1) puts me far from that position, so we're not immediately adjacent.\n\nGoing UP to (7, 2) seems like the most promising direction to expand my territory and set up for a better approach to higher-value apples.\n\nUP\n\nWait, let me reconsider the initial move because the game description says \"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game\" and shows the board as if you're moving from (7,1) already, so I am currently at (7,1) from the last frame.\n\nFrom this current position, let me see what would happen with the actual positions given.\n\nWait I need to be careful and read exactly what my snake head is at and what move was made.\n\nLooking at instruction block:\n\"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game...\"\n\nThen it shows boards with coordinates...\n\nThe last move log says:\nCurrent position: My snake head: (8, 1) \nbut now showing position:\nMy snake head: (7, 1)\n\nSo the system shows me:\n\"Your snake head:\" followed by \"(7, 1)\" \nThen says \"Current Board State...\"\n\nSo that means before making the move the head must have been at (8, 1), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nTherefore:\nAt the start of this turn: head at (7, 1)\n\nIf I go:\nUP -> (7, 2) - No apple, but keeps me in open area.\nDOWN -> (7, 0) - Gets to apple (4, 0) but that requires several moves.\nLEFT -> (6, 1) - Safe; might be necessary to avoid enemy later or for maneuver.\nRIGHT -> (8, 1) - returns to previous position with no gains.\n\nLooking at the apples relative to current position:\n- Apple (3, 4): that\u2019s up and left\n- Apple (0, 1): to the immediate left \n- Apple (4, 0): down and right  \n- Apple (3, 7): up and left  \n- Apple (4, 9): up and right  \n\nFor immediate tactical benefit from (7,1):\n\nSince my previous rationale said I moved LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1) \u2014 so I started at (8,1) and ended at (7,1).\n\nFrom (7,1):\n\nA smart next move would aim to avoid trapping myself while keeping access to several apple areas. \nOptionally, going toward the apple nearest to my position but still strategic in terms of future movement.\n\nFrom (7, 1):\n\nRIGHT leads to (8,1) - that\u2019s just returning to the last spot  \nLEFT leads to (6,1) - safe move that expands the horizontal space around me  \nUP leads to (7,2) - maintains vertical position to look for apple or room to grow\nDOWN leads to (7,0) - goes towards apple at (4,0), but not very direct \n\nThe safest and most flexible approach is probably:\nLEFT to (6,1)\n\nLEFT\n\nWait... \nThis is the game state: \"Your snake head: (7, 1)\" \n\nThat indicates we are ALREADY at (7, 1).\nThe statement **START LAST MOVE PICK** had a prior move that resulted in us ending at (7,1). \n\nIf the previous state had the head at (8,1) and we moved LEFT to get to (7,1), then we were at (8,1) previously and moved LEFT (decreasing x).\n\nNow considering the board again, from (7,1), there are four possible directions:\n- UP: (7,2)\n- DOWN: (7,0)\n- LEFT: (6,1) \n- RIGHT: (8,1)\n\nWe could consider:\n- Going UP (7,2) would be safer long term than DOWN toward (7,0) where apple (4,0) sits. \n- Going RIGHT (8,1) brings no gain vs staying at (7,1)\n- Going DOWN (7,0) gets to apple (4,0) but is a longer path\n- Going LEFT (6,1) opens up left-side area\n\nLooking ahead, if the snake continues to grow, moving LEFT gives me more horizontal space in case I need to move later without crossing my own body.\n\nBut there's an enemy at (3,3). If I go LEFT to (6,1) and then move UP or DOWN I am not in imminent contact.\n\nLet me evaluate apple proximity.  \nCurrent: At (7,1).\nNext apple in line closest is (0,1), directly left at distance of 7 squares. That requires 7 consecutive left moves before eating it!\n\nBut it's actually a better idea to move in such a way as to avoid being too constrained.\n\nThe strategic option is to go towards one of the more open paths or the apples with greater accessibility without locking oneself in.\n\nGoing LEFT to (6,1) seems to be giving me the most freedom, especially since I don't yet know where exactly the enemy will move and I don\u2019t want to go into restricted territory.\n\nLEFT",

However, that's also where the enemy snake is located (but wait, I see '1' there - that seems to be an enemy snake head, not an apple).\n\nWait, let me re-read more carefully:\nLooking at board row 1: \"A . . . . . . . . 0\" - so (0,1) has 'A', meaning an apple, and (9,1) has '0', meaning my head.\n\nThe apple positions are:\n- (3, 4) - Apple\n- (0, 1) - Apple  \n- (4, 0) - Apple\n- (3, 7) - Apple\n- (4, 9) - Apple\n\nMy position: (9, 1) \nEnemy position: (1, 3)\n\nMy main considerations:\n1.

I need to go LEFT and land on (0,1) to get that apple.\n\nLet me recalculate my current valid moves from (9,1):\n\n- LEFT: to (8,1) - safe, but doesn't get me apple (0,1) unless I continue after eating it\n- DOWN: to (9,0) - safe\n- UP: to (9,2) - safe  \n- RIGHT: to (10,1) - OUT OF BOUNDS\n\nSo RIGHT is immediately fatal.\n\nFrom current position (9,1), LEFT leads to (8,1), UP to (9,2), DOWN to (9,0).\n\nLooking toward apples:\n- Apple at (0,1) requires moving LEFT 9 times (which would be 9 steps through empty space)  \n- Apple at (3,4) - requires moving left, then up\n- Apple at (4,0) - requires moving left, then down\n- Apple at (3,7) - requires moving left then up\n- Apple at (4,9) - requires moving left, then up\n\nLet me consider what apple is most beneficial:\n1. (0,1) is close but requires very precise movement\n2. The closest strategic apple would be (3,4) (in terms of getting more distance from snake) but that's further\n3. Actually, I see (4,0) apple which is within reasonable range \n\nLooking at the layout carefully:\n(9,1) is positioned almost at the right edge with clear path to (8,1).\nThe apple at (0,1) is only reachable by going left all the way to (0,1). But we also see that we can move to (8,1), (9,0), or (9,2) safely.\n\nActually, let's step back. The apple at (0,1) is directly west of us! We have:\n\n(0,1) | (1,1) | (2,1) | (3,1) | ... | (8,1) | (9,1) \nA     | .     | .     | .     | ... | .     | 0 <- my head\n\nSo I could move LEFT 9 spaces to reach apple (0,1). \nThis means I could move LEFT nine times. \nBut each move takes one step.\n\nIf I move LEFT once: (9,1) -> (8,1)\nThen I can potentially get an apple at (0,1) eventually...\n\nWait, wait, let me reread more carefully the board.\n\nThe apples are at coordinates given: (3, 4), (0, 1), (4, 0), (3, 7), (4, 9)\n\nAnd I am at (9,1)\n\nLooking at positions, and reading from the board:\nRow 9: \"A . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 8: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 7: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 6: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 5: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 4: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 3: \" . 1 . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 2: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 1: \" A . . . . . . . . 0 \" \nRow 0: \" . . . . A . . . . . \"\n\nRow 1: A(0,1) [Apple] . . . . . . . . 0(9,1) - This shows that my head is at (9,1) and apple is at (0,1)\n\nSo to get the apple at (0,1), I need to move left many steps.\n\nActually, just moving LEFT 8 spaces takes me from (9,1) to (1,1). \n\nSo:\n- Move LEFT 8 times to get to (1,1)\n- Then move down from (1,1) to (1,0) \n- Then move LEFT to reach (0,0) \n\nThat isn't efficient. I can move LEFT once to (8,1) and then decide.\n\nLet's focus first on being safe. If I move LEFT to (8,1) and then look at paths, that places me in a good spot.\n\nAlso, if I can simply go LEFT once, I get to (8,1). From there, my options are:\n- Left to (7,1)\n- Up to (8,2) \n- Down to (8,0)\n\nNone look promising for immediate apple collection. There is an apple at (0,1), but we are trying to avoid going straight into the enemy snake location. Let's make sure:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,1), then the snake at (1,3) is now at a safer distance, and my position is open.\n\nThe most logical immediate safe move is to go LEFT to (8,1) because:\n- It is safe\n- It avoids touching enemy\n- Sets up possibilities for further navigation\n\nStrategy: Go LEFT to (8,1)\n\nActually let me check what happens if instead we move UP. I'd be at (9,2) - that's okay.\n\nHowever, let's check if there is anything that forces me to prioritize any specific route.\n\nWhat I really do want to do - get an apple without being too risky.\n\nGoing to (0,1) with a long left move... That\u2019s fine if it yields an apple.\n\nLet\u2019s say my goal is to approach the nearest apples efficiently. The apple at (0,1) is only reachable via 9 steps left, but that might be worth it if no immediate food. Let's say I move LEFT to (8,1). Then I can evaluate subsequent moves in the next turn. This seems like it keeps me alive AND gives an opening to explore.\n\nOr I can move UP. Then to (9,2).\n\nSo either (LEFT) or (UP).\n\nI think better to go LEFT once, to (8,1). This allows me to move away from potentially dangerous area (enemy at (1,3)) AND positions me well.\n\nMoving LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Safety - avoiding immediate collision with the enemy\n2. Path to apples - maintaining flexibility to reach viable apples\n\nI noticed the enemy is at (3, 3), and my current spot (7, 1) puts me far from that position, so we're not immediately adjacent.\n\nGoing UP to (7, 2) seems like the most promising direction to expand my territory and set up for a better approach to higher-value apples.\n\nUP\n\nWait, let me reconsider the initial move because the game description says \"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game\" and shows the board as if you're moving from (7,1) already, so I am currently at (7,1) from the last frame.\n\nFrom this current position, let me see what would happen with the actual positions given.\n\nWait I need to be careful and read exactly what my snake head is at and what move was made.\n\nLooking at instruction block:\n\"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game...\"\n\nThen it shows boards with coordinates...\n\nThe last move log says:\nCurrent position: My snake head: (8, 1) \nbut now showing position:\nMy snake head: (7, 1)\n\nSo the system shows me:\n\"Your snake head:\" followed by \"(7, 1)\" \nThen says \"Current Board State...\"\n\nSo that means before making the move the head must have been at (8, 1), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nTherefore:\nAt the start of this turn: head at (7, 1)\n\nIf I go:\nUP -> (7, 2) - No apple, but keeps me in open area.\nDOWN -> (7, 0) - Gets to apple (4, 0) but that requires several moves.\nLEFT -> (6, 1) - Safe; might be necessary to avoid enemy later or for maneuver.\nRIGHT -> (8, 1) - returns to previous position with no gains.\n\nLooking at the apples relative to current position:\n- Apple (3, 4): that\u2019s up and left\n- Apple (0, 1): to the immediate left \n- Apple (4, 0): down and right  \n- Apple (3, 7): up and left  \n- Apple (4, 9): up and right  \n\nFor immediate tactical benefit from (7,1):\n\nSince my previous rationale said I moved LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1) \u2014 so I started at (8,1) and ended at (7,1).\n\nFrom (7,1):\n\nA smart next move would aim to avoid trapping myself while keeping access to several apple areas. \nOptionally, going toward the apple nearest to my position but still strategic in terms of future movement.\n\nFrom (7, 1):\n\nRIGHT leads to (8,1) - that\u2019s just returning to the last spot  \nLEFT leads to (6,1) - safe move that expands the horizontal space around me  \nUP leads to (7,2) - maintains vertical position to look for apple or room to grow\nDOWN leads to (7,0) - goes towards apple at (4,0), but not very direct \n\nThe safest and most flexible approach is probably:\nLEFT to (6,1)\n\nLEFT\n\nWait... \nThis is the game state: \"Your snake head: (7, 1)\" \n\nThat indicates we are ALREADY at (7, 1).\nThe statement **START LAST MOVE PICK** had a prior move that resulted in us ending at (7,1). \n\nIf the previous state had the head at (8,1) and we moved LEFT to get to (7,1), then we were at (8,1) previously and moved LEFT (decreasing x).\n\nNow considering the board again, from (7,1), there are four possible directions:\n- UP: (7,2)\n- DOWN: (7,0)\n- LEFT: (6,1) \n- RIGHT: (8,1)\n\nWe could consider:\n- Going UP (7,2) would be safer long term than DOWN toward (7,0) where apple (4,0) sits. \n- Going RIGHT (8,1) brings no gain vs staying at (7,1)\n- Going DOWN (7,0) gets to apple (4,0) but is a longer path\n- Going LEFT (6,1) opens up left-side area\n\nLooking ahead, if the snake continues to grow, moving LEFT gives me more horizontal space in case I need to move later without crossing my own body.\n\nBut there's an enemy at (3,3). If I go LEFT to (6,1) and then move UP or DOWN I am not in imminent contact.\n\nLet me evaluate apple proximity.  \nCurrent: At (7,1).\nNext apple in line closest is (0,1), directly left at distance of 7 squares. That requires 7 consecutive left moves before eating it!\n\nBut it's actually a better idea to move in such a way as to avoid being too constrained.\n\nThe strategic option is to go towards one of the more open paths or the apples with greater accessibility without locking oneself in.\n\nGoing LEFT to (6,1) seems to be giving me the most freedom, especially since I don't yet know where exactly the enemy will move and I don\u2019t want to go into restricted territory.\n\nLEFT",

But the apple at (8, 2) is attractive because I'd be going in that direction.\n\nHowever, looking at the last move rationale I wrote earlier was actually wrong about my current position. The board states \"My snake head is at (5, 1)\" and the board clearly shows my head at (5, 1), not (7, 1) as I incorrectly stated. \n\nFrom (5, 1), moving RIGHT to (6, 1) seems logical to begin expanding towards the apple at (8, 2) to get a point quickly.\n\nBut wait, let me check if going RIGHT to (6, 1) will block my later options too much or if one of the other directions is better strategically. \n\nActually, since I'm on the left side of the board initially, moving RIGHT will move me more into the middle/right area. But the apple that is close is (8, 2) which is quite far horizontally. The other nearby apple is at (4, 0).\n\nLet me consider:\n- RIGHT to (6, 1) - positions me further to the right, potentially blocking some paths\n- UP to (5, 2) - positions better vertically, and I could eventually aim for (3, 7)\n- DOWN to (5, 0) - toward (4, 0) - this is a reasonable near apple\n- LEFT to (4, 1) - moves me toward (0, 1) or back towards center\n\nGoing to (4, 0) would take me toward the apple there.

However, that's also where the enemy snake is located (but wait, I see '1' there - that seems to be an enemy snake head, not an apple).\n\nWait, let me re-read more carefully:\nLooking at board row 1: \"A . . . . . . . . 0\" - so (0,1) has 'A', meaning an apple, and (9,1) has '0', meaning my head.\n\nThe apple positions are:\n- (3, 4) - Apple\n- (0, 1) - Apple  \n- (4, 0) - Apple\n- (3, 7) - Apple\n- (4, 9) - Apple\n\nMy position: (9, 1) \nEnemy position: (1, 3)\n\nMy main considerations:\n1. I can move LEFT to reach (8, 1) - no immediate danger, but not collecting an apple\n2. I can move DOWN to reach (9, 0) - there's an apple there at (4, 0) but that's not immediately helpful\n3. I can move LEFT to (8, 1) - safe and could set up future moves\n4. I can move DOWN to (9, 0), but then I'm vulnerable since I'll be in the lower portion and there's still an apple far away.\n\nActually, looking again at the (0,1) position, that has an apple. To reach it, I must move LEFT. That would take me from (9,1) to (8,1). This doesn't put me adjacent to the enemy snake.\n\nI have a couple of good options:\n1. Moving LEFT to (8,1) - this puts me near some open space\n2. Moving DOWN to (9,0) - gets me closer to (4,0) apple\n\nI should try to collect a nearby apple rather than going for very distant ones. The apple at (0,1) is directly to my left, though I'd move past it if I go LEFT to (8,1). I need to go LEFT and land on (0,1) to get that apple.\n\nLet me recalculate my current valid moves from (9,1):\n\n- LEFT: to (8,1) - safe, but doesn't get me apple (0,1) unless I continue after eating it\n- DOWN: to (9,0) - safe\n- UP: to (9,2) - safe  \n- RIGHT: to (10,1) - OUT OF BOUNDS\n\nSo RIGHT is immediately fatal.\n\nFrom current position (9,1), LEFT leads to (8,1), UP to (9,2), DOWN to (9,0).\n\nLooking toward apples:\n- Apple at (0,1) requires moving LEFT 9 times (which would be 9 steps through empty space)  \n- Apple at (3,4) - requires moving left, then up\n- Apple at (4,0) - requires moving left, then down\n- Apple at (3,7) - requires moving left then up\n- Apple at (4,9) - requires moving left, then up\n\nLet me consider what apple is most beneficial:\n1. (0,1) is close but requires very precise movement\n2. The closest strategic apple would be (3,4) (in terms of getting more distance from snake) but that's further\n3. Actually, I see (4,0) apple which is within reasonable range \n\nLooking at the layout carefully:\n(9,1) is positioned almost at the right edge with clear path to (8,1).\nThe apple at (0,1) is only reachable by going left all the way to (0,1). But we also see that we can move to (8,1), (9,0), or (9,2) safely.\n\nActually, let's step back. The apple at (0,1) is directly west of us! We have:\n\n(0,1) | (1,1) | (2,1) | (3,1) | ... | (8,1) | (9,1) \nA     | .     | .     | .     | ... | .     | 0 <- my head\n\nSo I could move LEFT 9 spaces to reach apple (0,1). \nThis means I could move LEFT nine times. \nBut each move takes one step.\n\nIf I move LEFT once: (9,1) -> (8,1)\nThen I can potentially get an apple at (0,1) eventually...\n\nWait, wait, let me reread more carefully the board.\n\nThe apples are at coordinates given: (3, 4), (0, 1), (4, 0), (3, 7), (4, 9)\n\nAnd I am at (9,1)\n\nLooking at positions, and reading from the board:\nRow 9: \"A . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 8: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 7: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 6: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 5: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 4: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 3: \" . 1 . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 2: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 1: \" A . . . . . . . . 0 \" \nRow 0: \" . . . . A . . . . . \"\n\nRow 1: A(0,1) [Apple] . . . . . . . . 0(9,1) - This shows that my head is at (9,1) and apple is at (0,1)\n\nSo to get the apple at (0,1), I need to move left many steps.\n\nActually, just moving LEFT 8 spaces takes me from (9,1) to (1,1). \n\nSo:\n- Move LEFT 8 times to get to (1,1)\n- Then move down from (1,1) to (1,0) \n- Then move LEFT to reach (0,0) \n\nThat isn't efficient. I can move LEFT once to (8,1) and then decide.\n\nLet's focus first on being safe. If I move LEFT to (8,1) and then look at paths, that places me in a good spot.\n\nAlso, if I can simply go LEFT once, I get to (8,1). From there, my options are:\n- Left to (7,1)\n- Up to (8,2) \n- Down to (8,0)\n\nNone look promising for immediate apple collection. There is an apple at (0,1), but we are trying to avoid going straight into the enemy snake location. Let's make sure:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,1), then the snake at (1,3) is now at a safer distance, and my position is open.\n\nThe most logical immediate safe move is to go LEFT to (8,1) because:\n- It is safe\n- It avoids touching enemy\n- Sets up possibilities for further navigation\n\nStrategy: Go LEFT to (8,1)\n\nActually let me check what happens if instead we move UP. I'd be at (9,2) - that's okay.\n\nHowever, let's check if there is anything that forces me to prioritize any specific route.\n\nWhat I really do want to do - get an apple without being too risky.\n\nGoing to (0,1) with a long left move... That\u2019s fine if it yields an apple.\n\nLet\u2019s say my goal is to approach the nearest apples efficiently. The apple at (0,1) is only reachable via 9 steps left, but that might be worth it if no immediate food. Let's say I move LEFT to (8,1). Then I can evaluate subsequent moves in the next turn. This seems like it keeps me alive AND gives an opening to explore.\n\nOr I can move UP. Then to (9,2).\n\nSo either (LEFT) or (UP).\n\nI think better to go LEFT once, to (8,1). This allows me to move away from potentially dangerous area (enemy at (1,3)) AND positions me well.\n\nMoving LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Safety - avoiding immediate collision with the enemy\n2. Path to apples - maintaining flexibility to reach viable apples\n\nI noticed the enemy is at (3, 3), and my current spot (7, 1) puts me far from that position, so we're not immediately adjacent.\n\nGoing UP to (7, 2) seems like the most promising direction to expand my territory and set up for a better approach to higher-value apples.\n\nUP\n\nWait, let me reconsider the initial move because the game description says \"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game\" and shows the board as if you're moving from (7,1) already, so I am currently at (7,1) from the last frame.\n\nFrom this current position, let me see what would happen with the actual positions given.\n\nWait I need to be careful and read exactly what my snake head is at and what move was made.\n\nLooking at instruction block:\n\"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game...\"\n\nThen it shows boards with coordinates...\n\nThe last move log says:\nCurrent position: My snake head: (8, 1) \nbut now showing position:\nMy snake head: (7, 1)\n\nSo the system shows me:\n\"Your snake head:\" followed by \"(7, 1)\" \nThen says \"Current Board State...\"\n\nSo that means before making the move the head must have been at (8, 1), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nTherefore:\nAt the start of this turn: head at (7, 1)\n\nIf I go:\nUP -> (7, 2) - No apple, but keeps me in open area.\nDOWN -> (7, 0) - Gets to apple (4, 0) but that requires several moves.\nLEFT -> (6, 1) - Safe; might be necessary to avoid enemy later or for maneuver.\nRIGHT -> (8, 1) - returns to previous position with no gains.\n\nLooking at the apples relative to current position:\n- Apple (3, 4): that\u2019s up and left\n- Apple (0, 1): to the immediate left \n- Apple (4, 0): down and right  \n- Apple (3, 7): up and left  \n- Apple (4, 9): up and right  \n\nFor immediate tactical benefit from (7,1):\n\nSince my previous rationale said I moved LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1) \u2014 so I started at (8,1) and ended at (7,1).\n\nFrom (7,1):\n\nA smart next move would aim to avoid trapping myself while keeping access to several apple areas. \nOptionally, going toward the apple nearest to my position but still strategic in terms of future movement.\n\nFrom (7, 1):\n\nRIGHT leads to (8,1) - that\u2019s just returning to the last spot  \nLEFT leads to (6,1) - safe move that expands the horizontal space around me  \nUP leads to (7,2) - maintains vertical position to look for apple or room to grow\nDOWN leads to (7,0) - goes towards apple at (4,0), but not very direct \n\nThe safest and most flexible approach is probably:\nLEFT to (6,1)\n\nLEFT\n\nWait... \nThis is the game state: \"Your snake head: (7, 1)\" \n\nThat indicates we are ALREADY at (7, 1).\nThe statement **START LAST MOVE PICK** had a prior move that resulted in us ending at (7,1). \n\nIf the previous state had the head at (8,1) and we moved LEFT to get to (7,1), then we were at (8,1) previously and moved LEFT (decreasing x).\n\nNow considering the board again, from (7,1), there are four possible directions:\n- UP: (7,2)\n- DOWN: (7,0)\n- LEFT: (6,1) \n- RIGHT: (8,1)\n\nWe could consider:\n- Going UP (7,2) would be safer long term than DOWN toward (7,0) where apple (4,0) sits. \n- Going RIGHT (8,1) brings no gain vs staying at (7,1)\n- Going DOWN (7,0) gets to apple (4,0) but is a longer path\n- Going LEFT (6,1) opens up left-side area\n\nLooking ahead, if the snake continues to grow, moving LEFT gives me more horizontal space in case I need to move later without crossing my own body.\n\nBut there's an enemy at (3,3). If I go LEFT to (6,1) and then move UP or DOWN I am not in imminent contact.\n\nLet me evaluate apple proximity.  \nCurrent: At (7,1).\nNext apple in line closest is (0,1), directly left at distance of 7 squares. That requires 7 consecutive left moves before eating it!\n\nBut it's actually a better idea to move in such a way as to avoid being too constrained.\n\nThe strategic option is to go towards one of the more open paths or the apples with greater accessibility without locking oneself in.\n\nGoing LEFT to (6,1) seems to be giving me the most freedom, especially since I don't yet know where exactly the enemy will move and I don\u2019t want to go into restricted territory.\n\nLEFT",

Looking at the board again:\n\nMy snake (ID: 0) head is at (5, 1)\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (3, 5) with body at (3, 4)\n\nThe board shows:\n- My head at (5, 1) - marked as '0'\n- Enemy head at (3, 5) - marked as '1' \n- Enemy body at (3, 4) - marked as 'T'\n\nAvailable moves from (5, 1):\n1. UP to (5, 2) - Safe, no obstacles\n2. DOWN to (5, 0) - Safe, no obstacles  \n3. LEFT to (4, 1) - Safe, no obstacles\n4. RIGHT to (6, 1) - Safe, no obstacles\n\nNow I should look for apples to collect. Apples are at:\n- (0, 1) - directly to the left but that's where I came from\n- (4, 0) - down and left \n- (3, 7) - up and left\n- (4, 9) - up and left (far)\n- (8, 2) - right and up\n\nThe strategic thinking:\n1. Apple at (8, 2) is closest to my current position (5, 1) - 3 spaces right and 1 space up\n2. Apple at (4, 0) is 1 space down and 1 space left  \n3. Apple at (3, 7) is 2 spaces up and 2 spaces left\n\nI'm currently at (5, 1). Going RIGHT to (6, 1) would be a good start to expand horizontally. But the apple at (8, 2) is attractive because I'd be going in that direction.\n\nHowever, looking at the last move rationale I wrote earlier was actually wrong about my current position. The board states \"My snake head is at (5, 1)\" and the board clearly shows my head at (5, 1), not (7, 1) as I incorrectly stated. \n\nFrom (5, 1), moving RIGHT to (6, 1) seems logical to begin expanding towards the apple at (8, 2) to get a point quickly.\n\nBut wait, let me check if going RIGHT to (6, 1) will block my later options too much or if one of the other directions is better strategically. \n\nActually, since I'm on the left side of the board initially, moving RIGHT will move me more into the middle/right area. But the apple that is close is (8, 2) which is quite far horizontally. The other nearby apple is at (4, 0).\n\nLet me consider:\n- RIGHT to (6, 1) - positions me further to the right, potentially blocking some paths\n- UP to (5, 2) - positions better vertically, and I could eventually aim for (3, 7)\n- DOWN to (5, 0) - toward (4, 0) - this is a reasonable near apple\n- LEFT to (4, 1) - moves me toward (0, 1) or back towards center\n\nGoing to (4, 0) would take me toward the apple there. That seems like a safe bet. \n\nHowever, let me re-check where I am and evaluate more carefully...\n\nRight now, I am at (5, 1). \n\nApple locations: (0, 1), (4, 0), (3, 7), (4, 9), (8, 2)\n\nFrom (5, 1), going LEFT would take me to (4, 1). \nIf I go that way, I'll be heading in direction of (4, 0) apple which is a direct route down.\n(4, 1) to (4, 0) is a valid move.\n\nSo, let's pick DOWN to (5, 0) to get the (4, 0) apple quickly. This seems safer than other choices because:\n1. It gets me a point quickly\n2. It keeps me moving toward a lower part of the board with potentially more space\n3. It avoids any immediate dangers from enemy snake which is at (3, 5) and far away\n\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",

However, that's also where the enemy snake is located (but wait, I see '1' there - that seems to be an enemy snake head, not an apple).\n\nWait, let me re-read more carefully:\nLooking at board row 1: \"A . . . . . . . . 0\" - so (0,1) has 'A', meaning an apple, and (9,1) has '0', meaning my head.\n\nThe apple positions are:\n- (3, 4) - Apple\n- (0, 1) - Apple  \n- (4, 0) - Apple\n- (3, 7) - Apple\n- (4, 9) - Apple\n\nMy position: (9, 1) \nEnemy position: (1, 3)\n\nMy main considerations:\n1. I can move LEFT to reach (8, 1) - no immediate danger, but not collecting an apple\n2. I can move DOWN to reach (9, 0) - there's an apple there at (4, 0) but that's not immediately helpful\n3. I can move LEFT to (8, 1) - safe and could set up future moves\n4. I can move DOWN to (9, 0), but then I'm vulnerable since I'll be in the lower portion and there's still an apple far away.\n\nActually, looking again at the (0,1) position, that has an apple. To reach it, I must move LEFT. That would take me from (9,1) to (8,1). This doesn't put me adjacent to the enemy snake.\n\nI have a couple of good options:\n1. Moving LEFT to (8,1) - this puts me near some open space\n2. Moving DOWN to (9,0) - gets me closer to (4,0) apple\n\nI should try to collect a nearby apple rather than going for very distant ones. The apple at (0,1) is directly to my left, though I'd move past it if I go LEFT to (8,1). I need to go LEFT and land on (0,1) to get that apple.\n\nLet me recalculate my current valid moves from (9,1):\n\n- LEFT: to (8,1) - safe, but doesn't get me apple (0,1) unless I continue after eating it\n- DOWN: to (9,0) - safe\n- UP: to (9,2) - safe  \n- RIGHT: to (10,1) - OUT OF BOUNDS\n\nSo RIGHT is immediately fatal.\n\nFrom current position (9,1), LEFT leads to (8,1), UP to (9,2), DOWN to (9,0).\n\nLooking toward apples:\n- Apple at (0,1) requires moving LEFT 9 times (which would be 9 steps through empty space)  \n- Apple at (3,4) - requires moving left, then up\n- Apple at (4,0) - requires moving left, then down\n- Apple at (3,7) - requires moving left then up\n- Apple at (4,9) - requires moving left, then up\n\nLet me consider what apple is most beneficial:\n1. (0,1) is close but requires very precise movement\n2. The closest strategic apple would be (3,4) (in terms of getting more distance from snake) but that's further\n3. Actually, I see (4,0) apple which is within reasonable range \n\nLooking at the layout carefully:\n(9,1) is positioned almost at the right edge with clear path to (8,1).\nThe apple at (0,1) is only reachable by going left all the way to (0,1). But we also see that we can move to (8,1), (9,0), or (9,2) safely.\n\nActually, let's step back. The apple at (0,1) is directly west of us! We have:\n\n(0,1) | (1,1) | (2,1) | (3,1) | ... | (8,1) | (9,1) \nA     | .     | .     | .     | ... | .     | 0 <- my head\n\nSo I could move LEFT 9 spaces to reach apple (0,1). \nThis means I could move LEFT nine times. \nBut each move takes one step.\n\nIf I move LEFT once: (9,1) -> (8,1)\nThen I can potentially get an apple at (0,1) eventually...\n\nWait, wait, let me reread more carefully the board.\n\nThe apples are at coordinates given: (3, 4), (0, 1), (4, 0), (3, 7), (4, 9)\n\nAnd I am at (9,1)\n\nLooking at positions, and reading from the board:\nRow 9: \"A . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 8: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 7: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 6: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 5: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 4: \" . . . A . . . . . . \"\nRow 3: \" . 1 . . . . . . . . \"  \nRow 2: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 1: \" A . . . . . . . . 0 \" \nRow 0: \" . . . . A . . . . . \"\n\nRow 1: A(0,1) [Apple] . . . . . . . . 0(9,1) - This shows that my head is at (9,1) and apple is at (0,1)\n\nSo to get the apple at (0,1), I need to move left many steps.\n\nActually, just moving LEFT 8 spaces takes me from (9,1) to (1,1). \n\nSo:\n- Move LEFT 8 times to get to (1,1)\n- Then move down from (1,1) to (1,0) \n- Then move LEFT to reach (0,0) \n\nThat isn't efficient. I can move LEFT once to (8,1) and then decide.\n\nLet's focus first on being safe. If I move LEFT to (8,1) and then look at paths, that places me in a good spot.\n\nAlso, if I can simply go LEFT once, I get to (8,1). From there, my options are:\n- Left to (7,1)\n- Up to (8,2) \n- Down to (8,0)\n\nNone look promising for immediate apple collection. There is an apple at (0,1), but we are trying to avoid going straight into the enemy snake location. Let's make sure:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,1), then the snake at (1,3) is now at a safer distance, and my position is open.\n\nThe most logical immediate safe move is to go LEFT to (8,1) because:\n- It is safe\n- It avoids touching enemy\n- Sets up possibilities for further navigation\n\nStrategy: Go LEFT to (8,1)\n\nActually let me check what happens if instead we move UP. I'd be at (9,2) - that's okay.\n\nHowever, let's check if there is anything that forces me to prioritize any specific route.\n\nWhat I really do want to do - get an apple without being too risky.\n\nGoing to (0,1) with a long left move... That\u2019s fine if it yields an apple.\n\nLet\u2019s say my goal is to approach the nearest apples efficiently. The apple at (0,1) is only reachable via 9 steps left, but that might be worth it if no immediate food. Let's say I move LEFT to (8,1). Then I can evaluate subsequent moves in the next turn. This seems like it keeps me alive AND gives an opening to explore.\n\nOr I can move UP. Then to (9,2).\n\nSo either (LEFT) or (UP).\n\nI think better to go LEFT once, to (8,1). This allows me to move away from potentially dangerous area (enemy at (1,3)) AND positions me well.\n\nMoving LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Path to apples - maintaining flexibility to reach viable apples\n\nI noticed the enemy is at (3, 3), and my current spot (7, 1) puts me far from that position, so we're not immediately adjacent.\n\nGoing UP to (7, 2) seems like the most promising direction to expand my territory and set up for a better approach to higher-value apples.\n\nUP\n\nWait, let me reconsider the initial move because the game description says \"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game\" and shows the board as if you're moving from (7,1) already, so I am currently at (7,1) from the last frame.\n\nFrom this current position, let me see what would happen with the actual positions given.\n\nWait I need to be careful and read exactly what my snake head is at and what move was made.\n\nLooking at instruction block:\n\"You are controlling a snake in a multi-apple Snake game...\"\n\nThen it shows boards with coordinates...\n\nThe last move log says:\nCurrent position: My snake head: (8, 1) \nbut now showing position:\nMy snake head: (7, 1)\n\nSo the system shows me:\n\"Your snake head:\" followed by \"(7, 1)\" \nThen says \"Current Board State...\"\n\nSo that means before making the move the head must have been at (8, 1), and the last move was LEFT.\n\nTherefore:\nAt the start of this turn: head at (7, 1)\n\nIf I go:\nUP -> (7, 2) - No apple, but keeps me in open area.\nDOWN -> (7, 0) - Gets to apple (4, 0) but that requires several moves.\nLEFT -> (6, 1) - Safe; might be necessary to avoid enemy later or for maneuver.\nRIGHT -> (8, 1) - returns to previous position with no gains.\n\nLooking at the apples relative to current position:\n- Apple (3, 4): that\u2019s up and left\n- Apple (0, 1): to the immediate left \n- Apple (4, 0): down and right  \n- Apple (3, 7): up and left  \n- Apple (4, 9): up and right  \n\nFor immediate tactical benefit from (7,1):\n\nSince my previous rationale said I moved LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1) \u2014 so I started at (8,1) and ended at (7,1).\n\nFrom (7,1):\n\nA smart next move would aim to avoid trapping myself while keeping access to several apple areas. \nOptionally, going toward the apple nearest to my position but still strategic in terms of future movement.\n\nFrom (7, 1):\n\nRIGHT leads to (8,1) - that\u2019s just returning to the last spot  \nLEFT leads to (6,1) - safe move that expands the horizontal space around me  \nUP leads to (7,2) - maintains vertical position to look for apple or room to grow\nDOWN leads to (7,0) - goes towards apple at (4,0), but not very direct \n\nThe safest and most flexible approach is probably:\nLEFT to (6,1)\n\nLEFT\n\nWait... \nThis is the game state: \"Your snake head: (7, 1)\" \n\nThat indicates we are ALREADY at (7, 1).\nThe statement **START LAST MOVE PICK** had a prior move that resulted in us ending at (7,1). \n\nIf the previous state had the head at (8,1) and we moved LEFT to get to (7,1), then we were at (8,1) previously and moved LEFT (decreasing x).\n\nNow considering the board again, from (7,1), there are four possible directions:\n- UP: (7,2)\n- DOWN: (7,0)\n- LEFT: (6,1) \n- RIGHT: (8,1)\n\nWe could consider:\n- Going UP (7,2) would be safer long term than DOWN toward (7,0) where apple (4,0) sits. \n- Going RIGHT (8,1) brings no gain vs staying at (7,1)\n- Going DOWN (7,0) gets to apple (4,0) but is a longer path\n- Going LEFT (6,1) opens up left-side area\n\nLooking ahead, if the snake continues to grow, moving LEFT gives me more horizontal space in case I need to move later without crossing my own body.\n\nBut there's an enemy at (3,3). If I go LEFT to (6,1) and then move UP or DOWN I am not in imminent contact.\n\nLet me evaluate apple proximity.  \nCurrent: At (7,1).\nNext apple in line closest is (0,1), directly left at distance of 7 squares. That requires 7 consecutive left moves before eating it!\n\nBut it's actually a better idea to move in such a way as to avoid being too constrained.\n\nThe strategic option is to go towards one of the more open paths or the apples with greater accessibility without locking oneself in.\n\nGoing LEFT to (6,1) seems to be giving me the most freedom, especially since I don't yet know where exactly the enemy will move and I don\u2019t want to go into restricted territory.\n\nLEFT",

My main objective should be positioning for future apple collection.\n\nLooking at apple distances:\n- (0, 1): 7 spaces left (would require 7 left moves)\n- (4, 0): 3 spaces down, 3 spaces left (a bit complex but reachable)\n- (3, 7): 4 spaces up, 4 spaces left (good distance)\n- (4, 9): 5 spaces up, 3 spaces left (far)\n- (8, 2): 1 space right, 1 space up (very close)\n\nThe apple at (8, 2) is very close and would give me a quick point with minimal movement.

Looking at the board again:\n\nMy snake (ID: 0) head is at (5, 1)\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (3, 5) with body at (3, 4)\n\nThe board shows:\n- My head at (5, 1) - marked as '0'\n- Enemy head at (3, 5) - marked as '1' \n- Enemy body at (3, 4) - marked as 'T'\n\nAvailable moves from (5, 1):\n1. UP to (5, 2) - Safe, no obstacles\n2. DOWN to (5, 0) - Safe, no obstacles  \n3. LEFT to (4, 1) - Safe, no obstacles\n4. RIGHT to (6, 1) - Safe, no obstacles\n\nNow I should look for apples to collect. Apples are at:\n- (0, 1) - directly to the left but that's where I came from\n- (4, 0) - down and left \n- (3, 7) - up and left\n- (4, 9) - up and left (far)\n- (8, 2) - right and up\n\nThe strategic thinking:\n1. Apple at (8, 2) is closest to my current position (5, 1) - 3 spaces right and 1 space up\n2. Apple at (4, 0) is 1 space down and 1 space left  \n3. Apple at (3, 7) is 2 spaces up and 2 spaces left\n\nI'm currently at (5, 1). Going RIGHT to (6, 1) would be a good start to expand horizontally. But the apple at (8, 2) is attractive because I'd be going in that direction.\n\nHowever, looking at the last move rationale I wrote earlier was actually wrong about my current position. The board states \"My snake head is at (5, 1)\" and the board clearly shows my head at (5, 1), not (7, 1) as I incorrectly stated. \n\nFrom (5, 1), moving RIGHT to (6, 1) seems logical to begin expanding towards the apple at (8, 2) to get a point quickly.\n\nBut wait, let me check if going RIGHT to (6, 1) will block my later options too much or if one of the other directions is better strategically. \n\nActually, since I'm on the left side of the board initially, moving RIGHT will move me more into the middle/right area. But the apple that is close is (8, 2) which is quite far horizontally. The other nearby apple is at (4, 0).\n\nLet me consider:\n- RIGHT to (6, 1) - positions me further to the right, potentially blocking some paths\n- UP to (5, 2) - positions better vertically, and I could eventually aim for (3, 7)\n- DOWN to (5, 0) - toward (4, 0) - this is a reasonable near apple\n- LEFT to (4, 1) - moves me toward (0, 1) or back towards center\n\nGoing to (4, 0) would take me toward the apple there. That seems like a safe bet. \n\nHowever, let me re-check where I am and evaluate more carefully...\n\nRight now, I am at (5, 1). \n\nApple locations: (0, 1), (4, 0), (3, 7), (4, 9), (8, 2)\n\nFrom (5, 1), going LEFT would take me to (4, 1). \nIf I go that way, I'll be heading in direction of (4, 0) apple which is a direct route down.\n(4, 1) to (4, 0) is a valid move.\n\nSo, let's pick DOWN to (5, 0) to get the (4, 0) apple quickly. This seems safer than other choices because:\n1. It gets me a point quickly\n2. It keeps me moving toward a lower part of the board with potentially more space\n3.
