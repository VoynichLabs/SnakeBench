Our snake's body is at [(7, 9)], so next, we want to continue moving to maximize growth and safety.\n\nNext move considerations:\n\n- If we move LEFT to (7, 9), it's safe and keeps us on the same row, away from walls.\n- Moving UP or DOWN is safe but might be unnecessary unless we're planning to chase other apples.\n- Moving RIGHT is out of bounds; can't do that.\n- Moving DOWN to (8, 8) is safe, but not necessary now.\n\nOur priority is to ensure continued safety and prepare for subsequent apples.\n\nNext, I prefer moving LEFT to keep the snake's direction consistent and stay away from the wall, and to position ourselves favorably for the next apples.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (8, 9) to (7, 9) seems safe.\n\nTherefore, the next move: LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

Moving UP takes me closer to potential enemy action and away from my planned direction towards the apples. Moving DOWN is not allowed. Therefore, moving RIGHT to (7, 7) seems to be the only viable option left. While it doesn't directly pursue apples, it maintains visibility and keeps me out of the range of immediate danger from the enemy.\n\nIn future turns, the goal will be to make a pathway back to the left towards the apples at (2, 5) and (2, 6). \n\n### Conclusion:\nI will move **RIGHT** to (7, 7). \n\nNext Move: RIGHT",
