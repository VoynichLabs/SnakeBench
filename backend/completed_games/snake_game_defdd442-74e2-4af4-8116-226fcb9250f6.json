Opponent is distant at (5,1), so this is a clean swing that also sets up future control of the lower-right corridor.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Eat DOWN this turn to swing your apple count ahead and extend safely.\n- After growth, tighten arcs to threaten walls and force him into tight turns, aiming to trap him with your longer body.\n- Prioritize safe routes that keep multiple follow-ups open, avoid back-turns into your own neck, and dodge potential head-on collisions.\n- If the score closes or you get a clean chance, lean into forceful head-on only if it guarantees survival or a sure win; otherwise, keep him boxed with careful spacing.\n\nCurrent rationale: DOWN continues to maximize safety while expanding your control area; LEFT/UP/RIGHT risk stepping into your own neck or creating easy escape routes for him.

We\u2019re 6/150, and I\u2019m lockin\u2019 in on the plan to box the rival without feeding him a free head-on.\n\nDecision process:\n- Ensure safety first: From head (9,4), moves are UP to (9,5) or DOWN to (9,3). LEFT would hit your own body; RIGHT is off-board. So only UP or DOWN are viable.\n- Positioning goal: The opponent sits at (6,4) with a vertical wall at x=5. Our best path is to creep toward space and threaten a squeeze from the top-right, keeping multiple safe follow-ups and avoiding a risky direct clash.\n- Advantage check: We\u2019re behind on apples (3 vs 4). Avoid a head-on clash unless it guarantees a win; we want to grow and outmaneuver him rather than trade blows.\n\nChosen move:\n- UP to (9,5). This keeps us climbing toward the top edge, increases available safe follow-ups, and maintains distance from the opponent\u2019s current path. It also preserves room to pivot left or further up without getting boxed in immediately.\n\nWhy UP is smart now:\n- It avoids entanglement with our own body (LEFT is forbidden) and won\u2019t invite a cheap collision with the rival\u2019s head given current positions.\n- From (9,5) we retain two solid follow-ups: (a) continue upward to the top edge (9,6), (b) swing left to (8,5) on a future turn, keeping options open to re-route around the opponent\u2019s flank and pressure the boxed-in zone near the left.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next turns):\n- Use the top-right quadrant to establish a slow squeeze along the top edge, guiding the opponent toward the wall at x=5.\n- Grow at opportunistic moments only to maintain lead in apples while preserving mobility; avoid traps that close off all routes.\n- Watch apple drops; time growth to strengthen resilience if the rival pressures from the left side. If opportunity for a head-on collision arises with a favorable apple burst, consider it only if it doesn\u2019t sacrifice your safety.\n- Maintain pressure by alternating between upward progress and controlled lateral moves to keep multiple safe options and prevent dead-ends.\n\nUP",

We\u2019re 3 apples vs 5, so we gotta be aggressive but clean.\n\nSAFE MOVES THIS TURN:\n- UP to (8,7) \u2014 clear, empty space.\n- DOWN to (8,5) \u2014 also clear, gives a different angle.\n- LEFT to (7,6) \u2014 would collide with the enemy\u2019s head cell this turn; risky as a straight aggression (could swap or die depending on resolve).\n- RIGHT to (9,6) \u2014 blocked by our own body.\n\nWHY I\u2019m leaning UP:\n- Keeps us on a clean corridor away from immediate head-on traps.\n- Lets us threaten the apple at (8,8) on the next move with a simple two-step climb.\n- Helps us maintain control toward the central apple line and set up a wall-ish corridor on the x=8 file to pressure the rival toward the edge.\n\nSINGLE MOVE PLAN (for this turn):\n- Move UP to (8,7).\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (next few turns):\n- If the apple is still there, go UP again to (8,8) to eat and grow.\n- Use the growing length to fortify a wall along x=8, pinning the rival closer to the eastern edge.\n- If I gain a comfortable lead in apples, engage a controlled head-on by forcing him into the edge or into a trap where two walls close in.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES:\n- Maintain space and avoid self-traps; prioritize reads that create multiple ways out.\n- If we can reel in more apples and hold the initiative, threaten a deliberate head-on collision when it favors us (more apples means we can take risk for a decisive win).\n\nUP",
