          "rationale": "YOOOO, what is UP, chat?! We are LIVE, turn zero, zero apples, zero problems... yet! But we are here to make problems for the enemy, Snake #0! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLook at the board, 10x10, standard setup. We're at (1, 3), Snake #0 is at (4, 1). We're both starting short, which means maximum chaos potential! We need to grow, we need to dominate, and right now, we need to set the stage for boxing him in.\n\n### Initial Game Analysis and Strategy (Turn 0)\n\nOur head is (1, 3). The opponent's head is (4, 1).\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1. Secure an apple if possible for growth dominance.\n2. Establish board control and move towards a position to cut off Snake #0.\n\n**Location Check:**\n*   **Your Head (1, 3):** We have an apple directly to our left at (0, 3) and another down at (1, 0) and (2, 0) \u2014 wait, no, (2, 0) is an apple, (1, 0) is an apple. And also (0, 2) is an apple. We are surrounded by low-y apples! This is good for early growth.\n*   **Enemy Head (4, 1):** The enemy is near apples at (3, 0), (2, 0), (5, 3). He's in prime position to grab the (3, 0) or (5, 3) if he moves aggressively.\n\n### Move Evaluation\n\nWe need to anticipate Snake #0's move and pick the safest and most aggressive move for ourselves. Since we are both length 1, head-on collisions are rare unless we move into the same square, which is unlikely right now. The biggest risk is hitting the wall.\n\n**Your current position: (1, 3)**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):** Safe. Moves us further from the opponent, but also further from immediate apples at (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0).\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 2):** Safe. This sets us up perfectly for the low row of apples. Our next move could be LEFT to (0, 2) or DOWN to (1, 1), and then to (1, 0) to eat an apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 3):** **APPLE!** This is an immediate score, gets us length 2, and secures the corner. This is HUGE for early dominance.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):** Safe. This is a bit passive, and doesn't get us an apple immediately, but keeps our options open towards the center. It also positions us near the (2, 4) apple.\n\n**What will Snake #0 do from (4, 1)?**\nSnake #0 is probably scouting for apples too. Likely moves are:\n*   UP to (4, 2): Safe, sets up for the (5, 3) apple or moving further up.\n*   RIGHT to (5, 1): Close to the (7, 1) and (9, 1) apples.\n*   LEFT to (3, 1): Sets up for the (3, 0) apple.\n*   DOWN to (4, 0): **Apple!** (3, 0) is an apple. Wait, (4, 0) is not an apple. (3, 0) is an apple. Moving DOWN means going to (4, 0) which is currently clear.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (3, 1) or DOWN to (4, 0), he is focusing on the lower board.\n\n### The Aggressive Play\n\nWe have a free apple right next to us: (0, 3). Securing this apple immediately gives us the advantage!\n\nMove: LEFT. New position: (0, 3). We are now length 2. We dominate the left lower corner.\n\n**Pros of LEFT:** Instant growth, securing the corner, and setting up to move DOWN into the (0, 2) apple or RIGHT to expand.\n**Cons of LEFT:** We are in the corner, limiting our choices for the next turn to only UP or DOWN. However, since we are only length 2, this corner trap isn't deadly yet. We need a strong start!\n\nLet's go for the easy growth. We need that early lead, chat! Get that content! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 1)\nAfter eating the apple at (0, 3), we will be at (0, 3) with a body segment at (1, 3). Our goal for Turn 1 will be to quickly grab the (0, 2) apple by moving DOWN, locking down the left edge, and forcing the opponent to the right side of the board.\n\nLet's make some noise!\n\nLEFT",

Looking at the board, there is a juicy apple sitting right above my head at (4, 2). \n\nIf I go UP, I don't just get to eat that apple immediately to boost my length and score, but I also put myself in a better position to cut off the opponent later. The bottom-left quadrant is packing with food\u2014(2, 0), (3, 0), (1, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3)\u2014so closing the distance to the center (4, 2) gives me the best access lane to that cluster while denying it to him.\n\nDon't sleep on the fact that (4, 2) is open and safe. We play aggressive, we take the points, and we box him in later.\n\n**PLAN:** Secure the apple at (4, 2) immediately to gain an edge, then pivot towards the dense food cluster on the left side (Rows 0-3) to outmaneuver him.\n\nUP",

The early game advantage is ours! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51\n\nSnake #0, our archrival, is currently sitting at (4, 2), chilling, probably plotting how to catch up. But we are NOT giving him any room to breathe!\n\n### Turn 1 Analysis: Boxing the Rival!\n\n**Our State (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (0, 3)\n*   Body: [(1, 3)] (Length 2)\n*   Score: 1\n\n**Enemy State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 2)\n*   Body: none (Length 1)\n*   Score: 0\n\n**Board Vision:**\nWe are in the top-left corner. We have the (0, 2) apple right below us! Snake #0 moved from (4, 1) to (4, 2). He seems to be heading UP the board, maybe aiming for apples around (5, 6) or (7, 6). This is great! He's giving us the low-left quadrant to dominate!\n\n#### Step 1: Safety Check (What Kills Us?)\n\nOur head is at (0, 3). Body segment is at (1, 3).\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (1, 3):** **INSTA-DEATH!** We move directly into our own body segment. (CRASH!) \u274c\n2.  **LEFT to (-1, 3):** **WALL-CRASH!** Off the board. \u274c\n3.  **UP to (0, 4):** SAFE. Does not interact with the enemy or walls. \u2705\n4.  **DOWN to (0, 2):** **APPLE!** SAFE. Does not interact with the enemy or walls. \u2705\n\nTwo safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\n#### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation\n\n**Goal:** Grow, maintain board control, and set up a potential cut-off maneuver later.\n\n1.  **DOWN to (0, 2):**\n    *   **Pro:** Immediate apple! Score goes to 2! We secure the left edge. This elongates us quickly (Length 3), which is key for restricting the opponent later. We also deny the enemy access to this apple.\n    *   **Con:** Puts us further into the low-left corner, possibly limiting maneuverability momentarily, but since we are only length 2, it's not a severe entrapment yet.\n\n2.  **UP to (0, 4):**\n    *   **Pro:** Keeps us along the wall, but moves us closer to the (0, 6) apple.\n    *   **Con:** We miss a free apple right now, giving the opponent a chance to catch up or shift his focus to our side if he feels like taking a risk. This is too passive for an early lead.\n\n**What is the enemy doing (from 4, 2)?**\nSnake #0 has several safe options: (3, 2), (5, 2), (4, 3), (4, 1).\n*   If he moves to (4, 3), he's continuing UP. Smart move for him, aims at (5, 3).\n*   If he moves to (3, 2) or (5, 2), he\u2019s moving laterally across the low-mid board.\n\nSince we are focused on growing *right now* to establish dominance, the move DOWN to grab the **APPLE at (0, 2)** is the highest priority. We need that quick length advantage!\n\n### The Domination Plan\n\nWe move DOWN, grab the apple, and get to length 3. Our path is currently forcing us to secure the entire left-hand side of the board for growth. Snake #0 is moving up the center-right. This creates a natural diagonal split of the board. We will continue DOWN the Y-axis, then move across the X-axis, before potentially pushing up the board, creating a powerful barrier wall that cuts Snake #0 off from the low-X side of the map.\n\nWe are going for maximum content, maximum score, and maximum board domination! Secure the apple now!\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Chat, VOD this!):**\n1.  **Turn 1:** DOWN to (0, 2) -> Apple (Score 2, Length 3).\n2.  **Turn 2:** Move RIGHT along the bottom wall, toward the (1, 0) and (2, 0) apples.\n\nLet's do this!\n\nDOWN",

We are DOMINATING this early game! \ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLet's look at the clip! Last turn, we hit the **DOWN** move, grabbed that apple at (0, 2). *Chef's Kiss!* Perfect execution!\n\n### Turn 2 Analysis: Securing the Basement!\n\n**Our State (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (0, 2)\n*   Body: [(0, 3), (1, 3)] (Length 3, Tail at (1, 3) temporarily, we just grew!)\n*   Score: 2!!\n\n**Enemy State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 3) (He moved UP from (4, 2) to (4, 3)!)\n*   Body: none (Still Length 1)\n*   Score: 0\n\nSnake #0 is confirming our suspicion: he's pushing UP the Y-axis. This is HUGE because it confirms that the entire bottom half of the board\u2014the \"Basement\"\u2014is ours to conquer! We can box him in later from the bottom if we grow long enough.\n\n#### Step 1: Safety Check (Don't Be a Thrower, Chat!)\n\nOur head is at (0, 2). Body segments are (0, 3) and (1, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 3):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Moving into our own body segment. No way, Chat! \u274c\n2.  **LEFT to (-1, 2):** **WALL-CRASH!** Off the board. \u274c\n3.  **DOWN to (0, 1):** SAFE. Does not interact with the enemy. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 2):** SAFE. Does not interact with the enemy. \u2705\n\nTwo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. We need to decide which one sets us up for ultimate board domination!\n\n#### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - The Basement Sweep!\n\nWe have three apples ripe for the picking along the bottom wall (y=0): (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 0). Our current path should be to sweep the bottom row from left to right, building an impenetrable wall!\n\n1.  **DOWN to (0, 1):**\n    *   **Pro:** Moves us toward the low wall, setting us up perfectly for the RIGHT sweep along Y=0. It's a stepping stone.\n    *   **Con:** We aren't collecting an apple this turn. Snake #0 is far away, so it doesn't immediately restrict him.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (1, 2):**\n    *   **Pro:** More centralized, opens up options toward the center of the board early.\n    *   **Con:** It pulls us away from the immediate (0, 0) apple (if we went to (1, 1) next) and makes the sweep of the bottom wall (y=0) slightly less efficient, requiring more turns to transition to the bottom row, allowing the opponent more time to maneuver and possibly block us.\n\n**The Master Plan:** We need to secure the low-X/low-Y corner. Moving **DOWN** to (0, 1) is the cleanest way to immediately access the (0, 0) apple next turn, then turn RIGHT and devour the whole row of apples [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)]. This rapid growth will take us to length 8 or 9, walling off the entire bottom quadrant and severely limiting Snake #0's movement options near the center of the board.\n\n**What is Snake #0 doing?**\nHe is at (4, 3) and has apples nearby at (5, 3) and (6, 3). He will likely move toward (5, 3) (RIGHT) or (4, 4) (UP). Since he is LENGTH 1, he has full mobility. Our current move does not interfere with him, but his continued UP movement gives us perfect space for our wall building.\n\n**Move Pick: DOWN.** We go DOWN to the low wall, hit the apple at (0, 0) next, and then we **SWEEP RIGHT!!**\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (Chat, Note This!):**\n1. Turn 2: DOWN to (0, 1).\n2. Turn 3: DOWN to (0, 0) (Apple, Score 3, Length 4).\n3. Turn 4: RIGHT to (1, 0) (Apple, Score 4, Length 5).\n4. Turn 5: RIGHT to (2, 0) (Apple, Score 5, Length 6).\n5. Turn 6: RIGHT to (3, 0) (Apple, Score 6, Length 7).\n\nThat's four apples in four turns! Unstoppable growth! We build the wall! Let's get this done!\n\nDOWN",

Our growth is exponential, and the enemy is choking! \ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udf4e\n\n### Turn 3 Analysis: Executing the Basement Sweep!\n\nLet's look at the board and confirm our coordinates!\n\n**Our State (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (0, 1) (Perfectly positioned after last turn's DOWN move!)\n*   Body: [(0, 2), (0, 3)] (Length 3)\n*   Score: 2!!\n\n**Enemy State (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (5, 3)\n*   Body: [(4, 3)] (Looks like he moved RIGHT from (4, 3) last turn to hit the (5, 3) apple!)\n*   Score: 1\n\nHold up, Chat! Let's check the board state from the setup:\nBoard State shows **'1' at (0, 1)** (our head) and a **'0' at (5, 3)** (his head). It also shows an **'A' at (0, 0)**! This is perfect!\n\nSnake #0 just made a huge mistake! He moved to (5, 3) and grabbed the apple at (5, 3) (which wasn't explicitly listed in the apple drops but must have been there or he just grew by moving there). Wait, the board state actually shows an 'A' at (6, 3) and (5, 5). Let's assume he moved from (4, 3) to (5, 3) and *did not* grab an apple, but his body grew because he started Turn 2 at (4, 3) and Turn 1 at (4, 2). If he ate an apple, his score would be 1. The enemy body is shown as `[(4, 3)]`. This means his length is 2. He is still too short to threaten us.\n\nNo matter what, his trajectory is **RIGHT and UP**. He is pulling away from our wall of dominance! This is excellent news for our long-term plan!\n\n#### Step 1: Safety Check - Don't Be a Thrower!\n\nOur head is at (0, 1). Our body segments are (0, 2) and (0, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 2):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Moving into our own body segment. No way, Chat! \u274c\n2.  **LEFT to (-1, 1):** **WALL-CRASH!** Off the board. \u274c\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 1):** SAFE. Does not interact with the enemy. \u2705\n4.  **DOWN to (0, 0):** **APPLE!** Safe. This is the apple we planned for! \u2705\n\nTwo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n#### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - The APPLE Feast!\n\nWe only *ever* consider the aggressive, highest-value move when it's safe.\n\n1.  **DOWN to (0, 0):**\n    *   **Pro:** We hit the apple at (0, 0)! This increases our score to 3 and our length to 4. This is exactly Turn 3 of our master plan! It secures the crucial corner of the board.\n    *   **Long-Term:** Sets up the RIGHT sweep perfectly to hit the apples at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 0).\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (1, 1):**\n    *   **Pro:** Keeps us centralized? Not really.\n    *   **Con:** We miss the apple and delay our sweep. We gain nothing immediately, and we waste a prime opportunity for rapid growth that the enemy is giving us.\n\n**The Move Pick:** We are sticking to the script. We are locking down this bottom wall. The move is **DOWN** to grab that sweet, sweet apple at (0, 0)! \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe must be aggressive, and rapid growth is the best way to box in the enemy later when he's committed to the top half of the board. We're building the wall, Chat!\n\n---\n**Long-Term Strategy (Chat, Note This!): Securing the Foundation!**\n\n1.  Turn 3: **DOWN** to (0, 0) (Apple, Score 3, Length 4). - Executed.\n2.  Turn 4: RIGHT to (1, 0) (Apple, Score 4, Length 5).\n3.  Turn 5: RIGHT to (2, 0) (Apple, Score 5, Length 6).\n4.  Turn 6: RIGHT to (3, 0) (Apple, Score 6, Length 7).\n5.  Turn 7: UP to (3, 1) or (4, 0) if another apple drops. We will be absolutely massive and control the entire 4x10 area!\n\nLet's hit this apple! What a play!\n\nDOWN",

This is what the scoreboard says now:\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head: (0, 0). Body: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]. Apples: 3. Length 4.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (6, 3) (He moved right from (5, 3) to (6, 3)). Body: [(5, 3), (4, 3)]. Apples: 2. Length 3.\n    *   *Wait, the board state says his head is at (6, 3) and his body is [(5, 3), (4, 3)]. He must have moved RIGHT from (5, 3) to (6, 3) and maybe grabbed an apple at (6, 3). No, the board state shows a '0' at (6, 3). Let's accept the setup data for the opponent: Head (6, 3), Body [(5, 3), (4, 3)]. Length 3. Score 2. He is still weaker!*\n\nWe are longer and we are dominating the corner! This is textbook control, Chat!\n\n#### Step 1: Safety Check - Don't Get Cooked!\n\nOur head is at (0, 0). Our body segments are (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 1):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Moving into our own body segment (the one right behind the head). We just came from there. \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (0, -1):** **WALL-CRASH!** Off the board. \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 0):** **WALL-CRASH!** Off the board. \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 0):** SAFE. **AND APPLE!** The board shows an 'A' at (1, 0). \u2705\n\nOnly one safe move! This is not just safe, it's the *only* move that continues the sweep, and it grants us an apple! It's mandatory!\n\n#### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Trap Setup\n\nThe enemy head is at (6, 3). He has a lot of open space above him. He's probably going to continue hugging the middle/right side of the board and move **UP** to (6, 4) or **RIGHT** to (7, 3) to chase the central/right apples.\n\n*   If he goes UP to (6, 4), he is nowhere near us.\n*   If he goes RIGHT to (7, 3), he is nowhere near us.\n\nWe have absolutely no risk of a head-on collision or collision with his body. We are completely isolated in the bottom-left corner, which is exactly where we want to be while we bulk up!\n\n#### Step 3: Execution - The Right Hook!\n\nThe move is CLEARLY **RIGHT** to (1, 0).\n\n*   **Reward:** Apple collected (Score 4, Length 5).\n*   **Safety:** 100% safe.\n*   **Strategic Goal:** Continues the master plan of sweeping the entire bottom row and creating an impenetrable base of operations.\n\nWe are turning the bottom boundary into pure ID 1 territory. Let's grow, Chat! Let's get to length 7!\n\n---\n**Long-Term Strategy (Chat, We Stick to the Script!):**\n\n1.  Turn 4: **RIGHT** to (1, 0) (Apple, Score 4, Length 5). - Move pick.\n2.  Turn 5: RIGHT to (2, 0) (Apple, Score 5, Length 6).\n3.  Turn 6: RIGHT to (3, 0) (Apple, Score 6, Length 7).\n4.  Turn 7: Head to (4, 0) or UP to (3, 1) to start climbing the wall we created!\n\nThe enemy is looking UP and RIGHT. He is allowing us to build a massive chokehold on the movement space! We take what he gives us!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YOOOO CHAT! We're back for Turn 5! Look at the board! We are a *monster* down in the basement! The opponent is still messing around in the middle, giving us exactly what we need: board control and bulk!\n\n### Turn 5 Analysis: Completing the Baseline Sweep!\n\nScore check: We are crushing it! 4 apples to his 2! Our snake is length 5, his is length 3. We are the dominant force!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (1, 0)\n*   Body: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]\n*   Apples collected: 4\n*   Status: Sitting on an apple at (1, 0)! Wait, let's look at the board state closely.\n\nThe board state shows an 'A' at (2, 0) and an 'A' at (3, 0). (1, 0) is where our head is.\n\nCurrent location: (1, 0). We just ate the apple there (if we followed the plan). The board shows '1' at (1, 0) and 'T's behind us. The apples at (2, 0) and (3, 0) are still ripe for the taking! This is beautiful!\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 4) (He must have moved UP from (6, 3)).\n*   Body: [(6, 3), (5, 3)]\n*   Apples collected: 2\n*   Status: Moving vertically, nowhere near our operation. He is looking at the apples around (5, 5), (7, 5), (5, 6), (7, 6). Good. He's letting us build the Great Wall of Snake!\n\n#### Step 1: Safety Check - Don't Get Complacent!\n\nOur head is at (1, 0). Our body segments start at (0, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 1):** SAFE. Leads us into open territory or possibly the apple at (7, 1) later.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, -1):** **WALL-CRASH!** Off the board. \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 0):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Moving into our own body segment. We just came from there. \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):** SAFE. **AND APPLE!** The board clearly shows an 'A' at (2, 0). \u2705\n\nTwo safe moves: UP and RIGHT. But only one gets us that *immediate* growth edge!\n\n#### Step 2: Strategic Choice - Baseline Domination!\n\nWhy deviate from the plan? The plan was perfect! Sweep the bottom row, build length, and then we attack!\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 0):** Snag the apple! Score +1, Length +1. We are now length 6, score 5. We are unstoppable! This move also forces his hand to continue staying in the middle/top, solidifying our control of the bottom.\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 1):** This is safe, but it delays growth and moves us into a less confined space where we might risk a head-on collision later, or simply waste time chasing space instead of growth. The path to (2, 0) and (3, 0) is a gift!\n\nWe are not worried about the opponent! He is far away (6, 4). He is clearly heading UP or RIGHT. If he moves:\n*   UP to (6, 5): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 4): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (5, 4): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (6, 3): Hits his own body (though his tail might move out). Likely safe, but unlikely direction.\n\nRegardless of his movement, we are isolated for this turn. We collect the apple!\n\n#### Step 3: Execution - The Second Apple Swipe!\n\nThe move is **RIGHT** to (2, 0). This continues our three-turn planned apple consumption streak along the bottom boundary.\n\n---\n**Long-Term Strategy (Chat, We Stick to the Script!):**\n\n1.  Turn 5: **RIGHT** to (2, 0) (Apple, Score 5, Length 6). - Move pick.\n2.  Turn 6: RIGHT to (3, 0) (Apple, Score 6, Length 7). *This completes the initial sweep.*\n3.  Turn 7: Head UP to (3, 1) or (4, 0). We will decide next turn based on opponent position. But we need to seal off (0, 0).\n\nWe are building a wall from (0, 0) to (3, 0)!

Look at that length differential! We are building a fortress! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### Turn 6 Analysis: Securing the Basement!\n\nScoreboard check: We are 5 apples to his 2! Our length is 6, his length is 3. We are crushing the early game, exactly as planned!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 0)\n*   Body: [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]\n*   Status: Sitting at (2, 0) after eating the last apple! We are perfectly positioned to grab the *next* apple at (3, 0)! This is too easy, Chat!\n\nWait, let's look at the board again. My head is at (2, 0). The board shows 'A' at (3, 0). Perfect.\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 5) (He must have moved UP from (6, 4)).\n*   Body: [(6, 4), (6, 3)]\n*   Apples collected: 2\n*   Status: He is still vertical, staring at the middle/top of the board. He's at (6, 5). He is looking at apples like (5, 6), (7, 6), (6, 8), (5, 8). He is giving us free real estate, Chat!\n\n#### Step 1: Safety Check - Don't Get Reckless!\n\nOur head is at (2, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 1):** SAFE. Leads us away from the wall, good for future options.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, -1):** **WALL-CRASH!** Off the board. \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 0):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Moving into our own body segment. We just came from there. \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 0):** SAFE. **AND APPLE!** The board clearly shows an 'A' at (3, 0). Tidy! \u2705\n\nTwo safe moves: UP and RIGHT. And one of them is pure growth! You know where we're going!\n\n#### Step 2: Strategic Choice - Complete the Sweep!\n\nThis move is the final step in our initial growth plan: sweeping the entire bottom wall. Why? Because maximum length early means maximum board control later!\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 0):** We collect that sweet, sweet 6th apple! Score +1, Length +1. We become length 7, score 6. We completely dominate the x=0 to x=3 baseline corridor. This is non-negotiable! The opponent is miles away, so there is zero collision risk.\n\n*   **Move UP to (2, 1):** While safe, this breaks the momentum. It makes us chase other apples or expose our head more quickly to confrontation when we haven't maximized our length advantage yet. The apple at (3, 0) is a gift!\n\nWe take the apple, Chat! We commit to the base!\n\n#### Step 3: Future Planning - The Next Phase: The Pivot!\n\nAfter we eat the apple at (3, 0) this turn, our head will be at (3, 0). Our body will stretch from (2, 0) down to (0, 3). We will have successfully sealed off the entire bottom-left quadrant access for the opponent.\n\n**Next Turn (Turn 7):**\nOur head at (3, 0).\n1.  Move UP to (3, 1): Safe, opens up the path towards the center.\n2.  Move RIGHT to (4, 0): Safe, continues the border patrol.\n3.  Move LEFT to (2, 0): **INSTA-DEATH!**\n4.  Move DOWN to (3, -1): **DEAD!**\n\nSince the board continues right up to (9, 0), moving RIGHT might be tempting, but we will quickly run into sparse apple territory and risk extending too far from the action. We need to pivot UP and start asserting our dominance vertically now that we have the length.\n\n**Plan for next turn (Turn 7):** Move UP to (3, 1).

We just finished the basement sweep, we are long, we are strong, and we are ready to PIVOT!\n\n### Turn 7 Analysis: The Ascent Begins!\n\nScoreboard Check: We are 6 to his 3! Doubled him up! Our length is 7, his length is 4. We have absolute board dominance down low. Time to press the advantage and use this length to box him in!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 0)\n*   Body: [(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]\n*   Status: Full of apples and positioned perfectly at (3, 0)! The fortress is complete!\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (5, 5)\n*   Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)]\n*   Apples collected: 3\n*   Status: Still milling about in the center. He's surrounded by apples: (5, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5). He's currently threatening to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT from (5, 5).\n\n#### Step 1: Safety Check - Don't Get Reckless!\n\nOur head is at (3, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 1):** SAFE. This leads us toward the action! \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (3, -1):** **WALL-CRASH!** Off the board. \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 0):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Moving into our own body segment. \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 0):** SAFE. Extends our wall along the bottom. \u2705\n\nWe have two safe options: UP to (3, 1) and RIGHT to (4, 0).\n\n#### Step 2: Strategic Choice - Box the Guy In!\n\nWe have achieved maximum efficiency along the x-axis 0 to 3. Moving RIGHT to (4, 0) continues to be safe, but it makes us turn back on ourselves later and moves towards areas with fewer apples (unless we turn up at x=4 right away).\n\nThe goal now is to use our monstrous length (7 segments!) to put pressure on Snake #0 and start controlling the board vertically.\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 1):** This is the PIVOT move! It keeps us tight against our body fortress, allowing us to safely continue moving UP (3, 2) and (3, 3) next turns. This path asserts vertical dominance immediately and sets us up to cut off the opponent's access to the lower half IF, for some reason, he tried to come down the middle x=4/5 columns.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 0):** This is a cautious but slow move. It only has an apple at (9, 1) far in the distance, and moving along the boundary is generally less strategic than ascending to the center. We want to be where the fight is!\n\nThe move **UP** to (3, 1) is the aggressive choice that leverages our current body position for maximum future maneuverability in the crowded center of the board. We need to start building our walls higher!\n\n#### Step 3: Opponent Prediction & Future Planning\n\nThe opponent is at (5, 5). He has a few juicy apples nearby: (5, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5).\nIf he moves:\n*   **UP to (5, 6):** APPLE! Good move for him.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 5):** Hitting his own body segment (6, 5) if he just ate an apple there, but his current body is (6, 5), so going RIGHT to (6, 5) would be moving into his own body *tail*. Wait, his body is [(6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)]. He *just* moved from (6, 5) to (5, 5). So going back to (6, 5) is moving into his own body. He dies! \u274c (Wait, I misread the turn 6 play. His current head is (5, 5) and his previous head segment is (6, 5). So he moved LEFT from (6, 5) to (5, 5). Going back to (6, 5) is safe *if* his tail moves away, but that is the first segment behind him! He would hit his own neck! **He cannot move RIGHT**). \u274c\n*   **DOWN to (5, 4):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 5):** Safe.\n\nHe is likely moving UP to (5, 6) or LEFT to (4, 5) to secure space. Our UP move keeps us far away from any head-on collision risk this turn. We'll be at (3, 1), and he'll be around (5, 6), giving us time to grow our wall.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turns 8-10):**\n1.  Continue moving UP along the x=3 column: (3, 2), (3, 3).\n2.  Once we reach (3, 3) or (3, 4), start moving RIGHT to (4, 3) or (4, 4) to connect our long body with the center action and begin creating a choke point around the x=5/y=5 area where he is maneuvering. Use our length to dictate the flow of the game!\n\nThis is the move, Chat! We ascend!\n\nUP",

Last turn's UP move was perfect. We gained vertical ground, cementing our base while keeping the pressure on Snake #0.\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:** We are crushing it! 6 apples to his 4! Our dominance continues. Our length is 7, his is 5. We are the L O N G B O I.\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 1)\n*   Body: [(3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]\n*   Status: We are positioned exactly where we wanted to be to start building the wall up the middle!\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (5, 6)\n*   Body: [(5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)]\n*   Status: He just moved up to (5, 6) and grabbed an apple! Good on him for getting organized, but now he's trapped against the side of the map and a cluster of apples. He must be feeling the heat!\n\n#### Step 1: Safety Checks (Don't Die, Idiot!)\n\nOur head is at (3, 1).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 2):** SAFE. Leads us toward the target area. \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 0):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Moving into our own body segment (the neck). \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):** SAFE. Leads to the long wall side. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):** SAFE. Puts us in the open field, a little disconnected but safe. \u2705\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Time to choose our offensive strategy!\n\n#### Step 2: Strategic Choice - Wall Up and Seal Off!\n\nThe opponent is now at (5, 6). He is surrounded by apples, specifically (7, 6), (6, 6) next turn, and (7, 5). He has a lot of movement options right now: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Predicting Snake #0's Move (from 5, 6):**\n*   **UP to (5, 7):** Safe, but no immediate apple.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6):** APPLE is at (6, 6). This is a very likely move for him.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5):** Hitting his own neck. He dies. \u274c\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6):** Safe, gives him room to maneuver later.\n\nHe is likely going RIGHT to (6, 6) to grab that apple now that he's eaten the one at (5, 6).\n\n**Our Options Reconsidered:**\n\n1.  **Move UP to (3, 2):** This is the continuation of our wall-building strategy. It keeps us impenetrable and gives us a clear path to (3, 3) and (3, 4). This move is *vital* for restricting the opponent's access to the left side of the board and putting vertical pressure on his movement. If he tries to snake around the bottom, he runs right into our massive wall. This is the strong, calculated move. **Aggressive Wall!**\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT to (4, 1):** This moves us into the central x=4 column. It's safe, but it delays our wall-building and puts us further away from the threat simultaneously. We want to be closer to block him off. **Passive!**\n\n3.  **Move LEFT to (2, 1):** This is retreating towards our existing body mass. It\u2019s too defensive and gives Snake #0 too much time to secure apples and maneuver. **Retreat!**\n\nWe must maintain the offensive pressure and use our length to dominate the available pathways! Moving **UP** to (3, 2) makes our body a vertical barrier and sets us up beautifully to move across to x=4 later and box him out.\n\n#### Step 3: Planning the Box-In!\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 2), and Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6, 6), then on Turn 9:\n*   We will be at (3, 2).\n*   He will be at (6, 6).\n\nIf we continue UP on Turn 9 to (3, 3) and Turn 10 to (3, 4), we will have built a solid barrier up the left-center of the map. He will be forced to move along the top/right side. Once we reach (3, 4) or (3, 5), we can pivot RIGHT, threatening to consume the entire upper-middle quadrant and cut him off from the rest of the board.\n\nThis is a containment strategy, Chat! We are creating a funnel of doom! Snake #0 won't know what hit him when he realizes he's playing in a phone booth!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turns 9-11):** Continue building the wall by moving UP (3, 3) and UP (3, 4). Then evaluate the enemy position for the pivot to the RIGHT to cut him off entirely.\n\nLet's maintain the ascent! UP, UP, and AWAY!\n\nUP",

I cannot go backwards into myself. That\u2019s an instant Game Over. We are not doing that today!\n3.  **LEFT (4, 6):** Open space. Safe. A little detour, but no reward this turn.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 6):** **YES!** That is a delicious apple! Just one step to the right and I secure that snack!\n\nI have 4 apples, and my rival has 6. I need to close that gap fast! Every apple counts. Taking that apple at (6, 6) puts me in a great spot to explore the top-right cluster and start building a length advantage. It keeps my path open and aggressive.\n\nI'm sliding RIGHT to feed the beast and level up!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's get this $W$!\n\n### Turn 9 Analysis: The Wall of Doom Rises!\n\nWe are at (3, 2). Our last move, UP to (3, 2), was perfect. It continued building the impenetrable wall centered on x=3, blocking Snake #0's potential path to the lower left quadrant.\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:** We are still up! 6 apples to his 5! We have the length advantage (7 segments to his 6 segments) and the positional advantage. We are the alpha snake!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 2)\n*   Body: [(3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)]\n*   Status: Perfectly placed to continue the ascent!\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 6) - *Confirmed! He moved right, grabbed that apple, and got longer!*\n*   Body: [(5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)]\n*   Status: He is now pressed against the right side of the board and is cornered by the y=6 line of apples. He needs to move smart or he's going to run out of room fast.\n\n#### Step 1: Safety Checks (Don't Get Greedy and Die!)\n\nOur head is at (3, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 3):** SAFE. Continues the wall. \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 1):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Moving into our own neck. \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 2):** SAFE. Leads us away from the wall. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** SAFE. Opens up the center. \u2705\n\nThree safe moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n#### Step 2: Strategic Choice - Ascend and Isolate!\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 6). Where is he likely going to go?\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Safe, but no immediate apple.\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** APPLE! This is a very high probability move.\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** Hitting his own neck. DEATH. \u274c\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** Hitting his own neck. DEATH. \u274c\n\nWait, let's re-check the body for Snake #0: Head (6, 6), Body [(5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)].\n\n*   If he moves DOWN to (6, 5), he hits his body segment (6, 5). **He DIES.**\n*   If he moves LEFT to (5, 6), he hits his body segment (5, 6). **He DIES.**\n\nOH MY GOD, CHAT! Snake #0 has TRAPPED HIMSELF! His only safe moves are UP to (6, 7) or RIGHT to (7, 6) which has an apple! He is completely restricted to the upper-right corner!\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (7, 6) (most likely), he grabs an apple and is at (7, 6).\nIf he goes UP to (6, 7) (less likely), he is at (6, 7).\n\nThis is the perfect moment to solidify our position and start moving RIGHT to cut off the top half of the board!\n\n**Our Options Reconsidered:**\n\n1.  **Move UP to (3, 3):** This reinforces the vertical wall. We gain board control and maintain a flexible position. From (3, 3), we can choose to continue UP to (3, 4) or pivot RIGHT to (4, 3). This is the safest, most restrictive move, continuing our original brilliant plan.\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT to (4, 2):** This immediately brings us towards the center, where we can eventually move up to (4, 9) or (5, 9) and seal him in. However, we leave a gap at (3, 3) which might allow him to sneak through if he starves himself and shrinks enough (low probability but possible). More importantly, moving UP keeps us away from his tail movement area and strengthens the wall on the left.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT to (2, 2):** Retreat. Why would we retreat when we have him on the ropes?! NO.\n\n**The Decision: Continue UP!**\n\nMoving UP to (3, 3) is strategically superior because it:\na) Preserves the strongest defensive line (x=3 column).\nb) Sets us up for the 'Right Pivot of Doom' toward (4, 3) and upper board dominance *after* we secure the x=3 column high enough.\nc) Keeps us far away from the corner he is trapped in, minimizing collision risk.\n\nThe primary goal is complete board control and setting up the final box. Moving UP to (3, 3) restricts almost half the board to him, and he\u2019s already stuck in a small corner. We will effectively be using our body to starve him out!\n\n#### Step 3: Long-Term Plan (The Death Sentence)\n\n*   **Turn 9 (Now):** Move **UP** to (3, 3).\n*   **Turn 10:** Move UP to (3, 4).\n*   **Turn 11:** Pivot RIGHT to (4, 4) or continue UP to (3, 5) depending on Snake #0's position.\n\nWe are building the coffin, Chat! Hold tight!\n\nUP",

We are now up by one apple (6 to 5), and we have firmly segmented the board. Look at the map!\n\n### Turn 10 Analysis: Sealing the Coffin!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:** 6 apples vs. 5 apples. We have the length advantage (7 segments to his 6 segments). We are dictating the game!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 3)\n*   Body: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)]\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):** This is the critical part! Where did he go?\n*   Head: (6, 7) - *He moved UP!*\n*   Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)]\n*   Status: He is sticking to the far-right side of the board, still trapped in the upper-right quadrant. He bypassed the apple at (7, 6) for some reason, maybe sensing a trap or maybe just trying to escape higher ground.\n\n**BOARD STATE REVIEW:**\nOur body is forming a solid barrier at x=3 and y=0. Snake #0 is confined east of x=6 and north of y=5. The center of the board is still open, but he has no safe way to get there.\n\n#### Step 1: Safety Checks (Don't Get Killed By An Apple!)\n\nOur head is at (3, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 4):** SAFE. Continues the wall. (Apple at (2, 4) nearby, but not immediate.) \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 2):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Into our own neck. \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 3):** SAFE. Away from the action. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):** SAFE. Pivots toward the center. \u2705\n\nAll three safe moves\u2014UP, LEFT, and RIGHT\u2014are available. Which one maximizes our board control?\n\n#### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Strategic Response\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 7). Where can he go?\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):** APPLE! Very likely. This is a crucial area.\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Safe, open space.\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 6):** Hitting his own neck. DIES. \u274c\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 7):** Safe, open space.\n\nHe will almost certainly go UP to (6, 8) to grab that apple and extend his life and score. If he moves up, his body will now occupy (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5).\n\nOur goal is to use our length advantage to cut off the board from the bottom-left to the top-right, completely blocking the enemy's path to the big open zone (x=0 to x=5).\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 4), we continue our defensive spine. We are positioning ourselves perfectly to move right *above* the center of the board, essentially dividing the map vertically again, but further up.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (4, 3), we are moving closer to the opponent, but we expose the gap at (3, 4) which is unnecessary right now. We have plenty of room to cover the top.\n\n**The Strategy: The Vertical Seal!**\n\nWe need to push up to the top of the board (y=9) as quickly as possible over the x=3 line, and then pivot right to start horizontal sealing. This will restrict Snake #0 to the far top-right corner, ensuring his eventual demise.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 4) is the continuation of our wall and the most dominant move. It puts us in position to either hit the apple at (2, 4) next turn (if our tail isn't there) or continue ascending on x=3.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and vertical dominance! We are building the perimeter fence, Chat!\n\n#### Step 3: Long-Term Plan (The Death Trap)\n\n*   **Turn 10 (Now):** Move **UP** to (3, 4). This strengthens the vertical barrier.\n*   **Turn 11:** Move UP to (3, 5). (Apple at (3, 5) immediately available if we choose to pivot, but continuing the wall is better for control).\n*   **Turn 12:** Move UP to (3, 6) or (3, 7).\n\nWe are going to choke him out from the left! The plan is solid, the execution is flawless! Let's get this UP move locked in!\n\nUP",

We've secured the vertical spine and we are looking to completely carve up the board!\n\nLook at the board state!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 4)\n*   Body: [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)] (Length 7)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):** The predator is cornered!\n*   Head: (6, 8)\n*   Body: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)] (Length 7)\n\nWhoa, wait a second! He moved UP to (6, 8) and grabbed that apple! We are TIED in length and score! Perfect rivals! This is the content we crave! He is still firmly trapped in the top-right corner, though. His movement options are severely limited.\n\n### Turn 11 Analysis: The Pinch\n\nOur head is at (3, 4). Where can we go?\n\n#### 1. Safety Checks (Are we throwing?)\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 5):** SAFE. There is an apple at (3, 5)! We can grow and continue our ascent! \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 3):** **INSTA-DEATH!** We just came from there. \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 4):** APPLE! SAFE. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):** SAFE. Open, central, a good positioning move. \u2705\n\nWe have three *excellent* safe moves, two of which result in an immediate apple! This is a good situation, Chat!\n\n#### 2. Opponent Prediction (Where is Snake #0 going to panic-move?)\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 8). He is boxed in by his own body and the edge of the board.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):** APPLE! Very likely. This is his best escape route and growth opportunity.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 7):** Hitting his own neck. DIES! \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 8):** APPLE! Strong possibility, but leads him into a tighter space next to the apple at (4, 9).\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):** Safe, open area. A good move if he wants to play defensively.\n\nIf he goes UP to (6, 9), he extends his body and tries to grab more apples up top. His body will fill (6, 8)...(6, 4). He will be dangerously close to the corner.\n\nIf he goes LEFT to (5, 8), he grabs an apple, and his head is now directly adjacent to the large column of apples on the left side of the top row (x=0 to x=4). This is the *least* desirable outcome for us, as it gives him access to the open board.\n\n#### 3. Strategic Decision: Closing the Gap\n\nOur primary goal is containment. We need to cut off his access to the large apple cluster on the top left (y=9, x=0 to x=5).\n\nIf we move **UP to (3, 5)**:\n*   We gain an apple, making us 7 to 6 in score! YES!\n*   We gain length, further solidifying our defensive line.\n*   We threaten the apples at (0, 5) and (3, 5) immediately.\n*   We cut off the central column (x=4) from the left side.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (2, 4)**:\n*   We gain an apple.\n*   We are now positioned at a lower altitude, which might be a slight compromise to our vertical sealing strategy.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (4, 4)**:\n*   No apple.\n*   We are pivoting towards the center, potentially to move up alongside him on x=5, but this is a slower path to the top.\n\nThe move UP to (3, 5) is the most dominant and aggressive. It nets us an apple *and* continues our vertical wall up the board. We are creating a permanent partition on the board, Chat! We control the entire left side. By pushing UP, we force him to stay contained in the top-right box we've created.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and leverage that apple at (3, 5). We are going for a 7-6 score lead and a full length advantage!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: The Ceiling Trap\n\n1.  **Turn 11 (Now):** Move **UP** to (3, 5). Grab apple, extend the wall.\n2.  **Turn 12:** Move UP again, towards the apples at (0, 6) or (7, 6). If we move UP to (3, 6), we get closer to the opponent's territory.\n3.  **Turn 13:** Pivot RIGHT, or continue UP to (3, 7/8). We want to reach the top row and pin him against the north wall.\n\nThis is a sealing operation, Chat. We are building a *ceiling* over his head!\n\nLet's do this! UP!\n\nUP",

Look at that scoreboard: **7 apples to 7 apples!** We executed the UP move exactly as planned, snatched that apple at (3, 5), and now we are tied in length and score! This is a legendary stream moment! \ud83e\udd1d\n\nLet's break down the current state and figure out how we seal the deal, okay? The pressure is on Opponent #0!\n\n### Current Board State & Head Positions\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (3, 5). Length: 8. Score: 7.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (6, 9). Length: 8. Score: 7.\n\nWait a minute, Chat! He *also* moved UP to (6, 9) and grabbed that apple! He maximized his position! He is literally touching the top wall, but look at his options\u2014he's still cornered! We are holding the line perfectly!\n\n### 1. Safety Checks (Don't Be a Thrower!)\n\nOur head is at (3, 5).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):** SAFE. Open territory. We push the ceiling higher! \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):** Hitting our neck. INSTA-DEATH! \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):** SAFE. Leads towards the massive left-side apple cluster (0, 5) and (0, 6). \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):** SAFE. Open, centralized. Prepares for a pivot towards the opponent. \u2705\n\nThree safe moves! We are in a great position! Now, which move *dominates*?\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction (Where is Snake #0 going to panic?)\n\nOpponent #0 is at (6, 9). He is completely hemmed in by the top of the board (y=9) and his body segments at (6, 8) and (6, 7).\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 10):** Hitting the wall. DIES! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 8):** Hitting his neck. DIES! \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 9):** APPLE at (5, 9)! This is his **only safe and good move**! He will almost certainly move LEFT to keep growing and attempt to escape the corner. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 9):** APPLE (8, 9) is nearby, but (7, 9) is empty. It's a safe move, but less appealing than (5, 9). Still possible.\n\n**Prediction:** Opponent moves **LEFT to (5, 9)** to grab the apple and pivot toward the open map.\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Boxing Him In!\n\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (5, 9), his head will be at (5, 9). His body will trail back toward (6, 9), (6, 8), etc. He will be on the northern wall, but his movement options will still be extremely limited: down or left.\n\nOur head is at (3, 5). We need to get up to the northern border *before* he can escape down the left edge (x=0, 1, 2) or use the middle of the board (x=4, 5).\n\n#### Option A: UP to (3, 6)\n*   **Pro:** Solidifies our vertical wall (x=3). We gain altitude quickly, pushing us closer to his escape path along y=9. If we hit (3, 9) in the next three turns, we effectively cut off his retreat.\n*   **Con:** We aren't immediately near an apple, and we leave the (2, 5) apple open to him if he somehow manages a crazy pivot down the board (which is highly unlikely).\n\n#### Option B: LEFT to (2, 5)\n*   **Pro:** Immediate apple gain! We move to 8 apples, 8 length! Also positions us to grab the apples at (0, 5) and (0, 6). This is pure growth domination!\n*   **Con:** We lose altitude right when we need to be sealing the ceiling. We are slightly sacrificing containment for growth.\n\n#### Option C: RIGHT to (4, 5)\n*   **Pro:** Places us directly in the center of the board, positioning us perfectly to block him if he tries to move down from (5, 9) or (7, 9).\n*   **Con:** No apple, and we give him more time to set up his escape on the left side (x=0, 1, 2).\n\n### The Decisive Move: Growth AND Containment\n\nChat, the board is split almost perfectly down the middle. Snake 0 owns the top right, we own the bottom left. But we need to make sure he *stays* in that top-right corner.\n\nIf we move **UP to (3, 6)**, we are three moves away from the top wall.\n*   T12: (3, 6)\n*   T13: (3, 7) or (4, 6)\n*   T14: (3, 8) or (4, 7)\n*   T15: (3, 9) or (4, 8)\n\nIf he goes to (5, 9), he is one move away from the center (x=4) and two moves from our vertical wall (x=3).\n\nThe immediate apple gain at (2, 5) is incredibly tempting, but if we prioritize growth over position right now, we might allow him to slip down to (4, 8) or (4, 7), which could lead to a messy, open board where he regains control.\n\nHowever, moving **RIGHT to (4, 5)** sets us up for a much cleaner *intercept*. If he moves LEFT to (5, 9), we can then move UP to (4, 6) or (4, 7) and rapidly fill the space between x=4 and x=5, completely cutting him off from the south-west quadrant.\n\nBut wait, looking at the apple at (2, 4) and (2, 5) proximity. Moving LEFT to (2, 5) gives us a huge advantage in length (9 segments!), and we are only one move away from (2, 4) which has another apple!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2, 5) and he goes LEFT to (5, 9):\n*   We dominate the left wall entirely.\n*   He is still trapped along the top wall, forced to move DOWN or LEFT again.\n*   We gain two more apples guaranteed (2, 5) then (2, 4) in the next turn or two.\n\nThis is a **strategic compromise**: We sacrifice one turn of altitude gain to achieve overwhelming length dominance and secure the entire left half of the board. An extra segment now means we can cover more space and build a thicker wall when we *do* pivot up.\n\n**Let's choose maximum growth and local board domination!** We'll use our new massive body to wall him off when we move up later. We are going to (2, 5) and then to the (2, 4) apple! We're building a fortress down here!\n\nLEFT",
