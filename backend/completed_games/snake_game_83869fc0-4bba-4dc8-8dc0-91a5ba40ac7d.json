I could potentially overtake Snake #1 by doing a risky but strategic move, especially since Snake #1's head is only one position below and to the left of my current position. It could give me an opportunity to build a path for retreating if needed, avoiding immediate danger from Snake #1. My head position, if I move right (to be at (9,7)), then down (to (9,8)), will allow me to get the apple without directly confronting Snake #1 nor risking an immediate death by collision. After consuming the apple, I could potentially set up a flanking maneuver along the right edge of the board after a couple of turns, which could give me access to more apples and keep me away from the main conflict area.\n\nHowever, I should also be aware that if Snake #1 moves aggressively after I start the attack, it may block my access or trap me in a corner. I cannot predict the enemy's moves accurately at this moment. The burgeoning apple might be too tempting, but gaining it could entail significant risks. Moreover, my current body length doesn't provide any defense against such an approach, which I should avoid until I'm ready to outflank or have a more substantial head start to retreat.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best immediate move seems cautious yet forward-looking. I'll move RIGHT to (9,7), and if the situation becomes unfavorable, I'll divert to a different strategy. Should I end up in a compromising position after attempting to take the apple, my primary objective would be to retreat promptly, ensuring my survival for the subsequent turns.\n\n**Next MOVE: RIGHT**",

I could potentially overtake Snake #1 by doing a risky but strategic move, especially since Snake #1's head is only one position below and to the left of my current position. It could give me an opportunity to build a path for retreating if needed, avoiding immediate danger from Snake #1. My head position, if I move right (to be at (9,7)), then down (to (9,8)), will allow me to get the apple without directly confronting Snake #1 nor risking an immediate death by collision. After consuming the apple, I could potentially set up a flanking maneuver along the right edge of the board after a couple of turns, which could give me access to more apples and keep me away from the main conflict area.\n\nHowever, I should also be aware that if Snake #1 moves aggressively after I start the attack, it may block my access or trap me in a corner. I cannot predict the enemy's moves accurately at this moment. The burgeoning apple might be too tempting, but gaining it could entail significant risks. Moreover, my current body length doesn't provide any defense against such an approach, which I should avoid until I'm ready to outflank or have a more substantial head start to retreat.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best immediate move seems cautious yet forward-looking. I'll move RIGHT to (9,7), and if the situation becomes unfavorable, I'll divert to a different strategy. Should I end up in a compromising position after attempting to take the apple, my primary objective would be to retreat promptly, ensuring my survival for the subsequent turns.\n\n**Next MOVE: RIGHT**",

I could potentially overtake Snake #1 by doing a risky but strategic move, especially since Snake #1's head is only one position below and to the left of my current position. It could give me an opportunity to build a path for retreating if needed, avoiding immediate danger from Snake #1. My head position, if I move right (to be at (9,7)), then down (to (9,8)), will allow me to get the apple without directly confronting Snake #1 nor risking an immediate death by collision. After consuming the apple, I could potentially set up a flanking maneuver along the right edge of the board after a couple of turns, which could give me access to more apples and keep me away from the main conflict area.\n\nHowever, I should also be aware that if Snake #1 moves aggressively after I start the attack, it may block my access or trap me in a corner. I cannot predict the enemy's moves accurately at this moment. The burgeoning apple might be too tempting, but gaining it could entail significant risks. Moreover, my current body length doesn't provide any defense against such an approach, which I should avoid until I'm ready to outflank or have a more substantial head start to retreat.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best immediate move seems cautious yet forward-looking. I'll move RIGHT to (9,7), and if the situation becomes unfavorable, I'll divert to a different strategy. Should I end up in a compromising position after attempting to take the apple, my primary objective would be to retreat promptly, ensuring my survival for the subsequent turns.\n\n**Next MOVE: RIGHT**",

I could potentially overtake Snake #1 by doing a risky but strategic move, especially since Snake #1's head is only one position below and to the left of my current position. It could give me an opportunity to build a path for retreating if needed, avoiding immediate danger from Snake #1. My head position, if I move right (to be at (9,7)), then down (to (9,8)), will allow me to get the apple without directly confronting Snake #1 nor risking an immediate death by collision. After consuming the apple, I could potentially set up a flanking maneuver along the right edge of the board after a couple of turns, which could give me access to more apples and keep me away from the main conflict area.\n\nHowever, I should also be aware that if Snake #1 moves aggressively after I start the attack, it may block my access or trap me in a corner. I cannot predict the enemy's moves accurately at this moment. The burgeoning apple might be too tempting, but gaining it could entail significant risks. Moreover, my current body length doesn't provide any defense against such an approach, which I should avoid until I'm ready to outflank or have a more substantial head start to retreat.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best immediate move seems cautious yet forward-looking. I'll move RIGHT to (9,7), and if the situation becomes unfavorable, I'll divert to a different strategy. Should I end up in a compromising position after attempting to take the apple, my primary objective would be to retreat promptly, ensuring my survival for the subsequent turns.\n\n**Next MOVE: RIGHT**",

I could potentially overtake Snake #1 by doing a risky but strategic move, especially since Snake #1's head is only one position below and to the left of my current position. It could give me an opportunity to build a path for retreating if needed, avoiding immediate danger from Snake #1. My head position, if I move right (to be at (9,7)), then down (to (9,8)), will allow me to get the apple without directly confronting Snake #1 nor risking an immediate death by collision. After consuming the apple, I could potentially set up a flanking maneuver along the right edge of the board after a couple of turns, which could give me access to more apples and keep me away from the main conflict area.\n\nHowever, I should also be aware that if Snake #1 moves aggressively after I start the attack, it may block my access or trap me in a corner. I cannot predict the enemy's moves accurately at this moment. The burgeoning apple might be too tempting, but gaining it could entail significant risks. Moreover, my current body length doesn't provide any defense against such an approach, which I should avoid until I'm ready to outflank or have a more substantial head start to retreat.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best immediate move seems cautious yet forward-looking. I'll move RIGHT to (9,7), and if the situation becomes unfavorable, I'll divert to a different strategy.

Now, with my snake's head next to my body at (9, 9), I must ensure I maintain a safe distance from the rest of the body piece I possess and remain vigilant for any signs of Snake #1's movements.\n\nMy planned strategy should be as follows:\n- First, make the move up to (9, 9), which will bring my snake right next to the apple.\n- Then, carefully move up to pick up the apple at (7, 9) while monitoring Snake #1's potential trajectory.

I could potentially overtake Snake #1 by doing a risky but strategic move, especially since Snake #1's head is only one position below and to the left of my current position. It could give me an opportunity to build a path for retreating if needed, avoiding immediate danger from Snake #1. My head position, if I move right (to be at (9,7)), then down (to (9,8)), will allow me to get the apple without directly confronting Snake #1 nor risking an immediate death by collision. After consuming the apple, I could potentially set up a flanking maneuver along the right edge of the board after a couple of turns, which could give me access to more apples and keep me away from the main conflict area.\n\nHowever, I should also be aware that if Snake #1 moves aggressively after I start the attack, it may block my access or trap me in a corner. I cannot predict the enemy's moves accurately at this moment. The burgeoning apple might be too tempting, but gaining it could entail significant risks. Moreover, my current body length doesn't provide any defense against such an approach, which I should avoid until I'm ready to outflank or have a more substantial head start to retreat.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best immediate move seems cautious yet forward-looking. I'll move RIGHT to (9,7), and if the situation becomes unfavorable, I'll divert to a different strategy. Should I end up in a compromising position after attempting to take the apple, my primary objective would be to retreat promptly, ensuring my survival for the subsequent turns.\n\n**Next MOVE: RIGHT**",
