This is on the board and safe. No body to collide with, no enemy threat.\n\n3. **LEFT**: From (0, 9), moving LEFT would take me to (-1, 9) - this is OFF THE BOARD (min x is 0). **DIES - ELIMINATE**\n\n4. **RIGHT**: From (0, 9), moving RIGHT would take me to (1, 9). This is on the board and safe. No body to collide with, no enemy threat.\n\n**Remaining Safe Moves: DOWN, RIGHT**\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nLooking at the apple positions and the board:\n- Apple at (1, 8) is very close to my starting position - just one square away\n- Apple at (2, 6) is accessible by moving right and then down\n- The enemy at (9, 9) is far away on the opposite side\n\n**DOWN move**: Takes me to (0, 8). From there, I can easily move RIGHT to (1, 8) and grab the apple at (1, 8).\n\n**RIGHT move**: Takes me to (1, 9). From there, I can move DOWN to (1, 8) and grab the apple at (1, 8).\n\nBoth moves lead to the same apple, but RIGHT keeps me in the middle area and maintains flexibility. DOWN also works well. Let me consider which is better for future positioning:\n\n- If I go DOWN to (0, 8), I'm on the left edge which limits future options (can't go further left)\n- If I go RIGHT to (1, 9), I'm one step inward with more flexibility\n\n**Long-term strategy:** My best immediate target is the apple at (1, 8). Moving RIGHT positions me better to grab it next turn while keeping more options open. After collecting apples on the left side of the board, I can work my way toward other apples while maintaining distance from the enemy snake.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving DOWN gets me an immediate apple and grows my snake to 2 segments. This is excellent for early game progression.\n\nAlternative options (LEFT or RIGHT) don't get apples immediately, and moving toward the center/right would take me further from the concentrated apple cluster on the left side of the board (apples at (1, 8), (2, 6)).\n\nThe enemy snake at (9, 8) is far away on the right side - no collision risk this turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nPriority is to collect the cluster of apples on the left side of the board: (1, 8) and (2, 6). After grabbing these, I can work toward (6, 3), (7, 6) while avoiding the enemy snake which seems to be starting on the opposite side.
