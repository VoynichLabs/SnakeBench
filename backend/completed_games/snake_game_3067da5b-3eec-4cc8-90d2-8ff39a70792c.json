No point in moving further down without securing this one first.\n2. **Enemy Positioning:** The enemy snake (Snake #1) is focused on the bottom row, which opens up an opportunity to grab an apple without immediate danger.\n3. **Strategy:** Once the apple at (2, 0) is secured, switch to moving to (5, 2). This ensures we gather two apples efficiently before thinking about more risky maneuvers.\n\nLet's prioritize the apple at (2, 0) by moving **DOWN**.\n\nDecided next move: **DOWN**.",
