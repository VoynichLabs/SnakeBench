Quick, loud brain dump so the chat can roast him in real time:\n\nStep 1 \u2014 check all 4 directions from our head at (6,9):\n- UP -> would go to (6,10) \u2014 off the board. Instant death. NOPE. \u274c\n- DOWN -> goes to (6,8). On-board, not into any body. \u2705\n- LEFT -> goes to (5,9). On-board, safe for now. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> goes to (7,9). On-board, safe for now. \u2705\n\nStep 2 \u2014 avoid immediate collisions with the enemy (enemy head at (8,6), can move to (8,7),(8,5),(7,6),(9,6)):\n- None of our candidate moves equals any of those enemy target cells this turn, so no immediate head-on if we pick DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT.\n- But remember: scores are tied (0-0). We should NOT force a head-to-head (would likely be a draw if both die). We want to stay alive and be aggressive later.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 prefer moves that keep options open and let us approach the enemy to box him:\n- DOWN -> moves us off the top edge, opens 4 follow-up moves from (6,8): UP (back to 6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8). Best mobility and moves us toward the opponent (closer to center).\n- LEFT -> from (5,9) UP would be off-board, so fewer options (3 real moves). More edgey, easier to get cornered.\n- RIGHT -> from (7,9) also fewer options (top edge), but brings us toward the apple at (9,9). Apples aren\u2019t priority \u2014 domination is.\n\nRisk assessment & aggression:\n- I want to be the predator, not the prey. Moving DOWN gets us closer to the opponent and gives max escape routes \u2014 perfect to set up a box-in next 2\u20134 turns.\n- We\u2019re not forcing a head-on because scores tied; we\u2019ll instead pressure his space, cut off escape lanes, and only trigger a head-on if we hold a lead.\n\nShort-term plan for next moves (for future-me / chat replay):\n- Move DOWN now to (6,8). Next turn, continue to press downward/left to approach (8,6) while watching his moves.\n- Try to drive him toward the right or bottom edge and trap him against the wall or corner. Grab apples opportunistically if they help cut his escape.\n- Keep mobility high; avoid hugging the top edge. If he tries to approach for a head-on, let him come \u2014 we\u2019ll only accept if we have a points advantage.\n\nAlright chat, let's make him tilt. Time to close the net \u2014 moving DOWN.

If he moves up, step right then down to corral him.

Neck/tail behind head at (3,7) \u2014 so RIGHT is directly backwards and illegal. \u274c\n- Opponent head: (1,5) with body at (2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,5). They\u2019re up 4 apples to our 1. We do NOT want a risky head-on while we\u2019re down. Stay smart, stay hungry.\n\nMove legality and quick evaluation:\n- RIGHT -> (3,7): illegal (backwards into our body).

If they try to climb up to (1,6) for an apple, we can pivot to shrink vertical space next turn. If they hug the wall left, we chase and form a trapping wall.\n- We\u2019re behind on apples, so NO reckless head-on. LEFT is an aggressive, controlling play that keeps multiple follow-ups (DOWN to pressure or UP to keep options) while not forcing an immediate mutual kill.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (1,7) to claim their x-column and start compressing their maneuver area. \ud83e\udded\n- If they go UP to (1,6), pivot DOWN next turn to fold the pocket and threaten to box them between the wall and our body. If they go LEFT to (0,5) toward the wall, chase and form a wall behind them to reduce escape squares.\n- Avoid mutually moving into the same cell until we close the apple gap.
