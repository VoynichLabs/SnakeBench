The apples are scattered, but I'm not chasing food right now\u2014I'm hunting the enemy! \n\nCheck this:\n- If I go RIGHT to (2,7), I stay on track to dominate the center while keeping an eye on snake #0's position\n- If I go UP to (1,8), I might run into apple (1,8) but then I'd be closer to the top edge with fewer escape routes\n- DOWN to (1,6) puts me near apple (2,6) but I lose vertical positioning\n- LEFT to (0,7) would corner me against the wall with limited future moves\n\nThe enemy's at bottom-right corner. I need to control the center and upper-left area to eventually force him into a trap. RIGHT to (2,7) gives me maximum board control and keeps multiple options open for next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Establish dominance in the central upper-left quadrant, then slowly push snake #0 toward the bottom-right wall. Force them to make risky moves while I maintain safe escape routes. Once I get an apple lead, I'll go for the head-on collision to seal the win!\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 is at the bottom-right with 1 apple, but we're coming for that crown! \n\nLet's break down the moves:\n\n**Check the board state:**\n- I'm at (2, 7) after my last RIGHT move\n- Snake #0 is at (9, 0) with body at (8, 0)\n- No immediate threats - I'm free to move!\n\n**All four directions analysis:**\n\n**UP \u2192 (2, 8):** \n- \u2705 Safe! (2, 8) is empty on the board\n- Opens up access to apple (3, 7) and (2, 6) nearby\n- Moves me toward the upper-left quadrant where I can control space\n- Keeps my options open - I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN from there\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2, 6):** \n- \u2705 Safe! (2, 6) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Would give me my first point and grow my body\n- BUT... (2, 6) is right next to apple (3, 7) and (1, 4) isn't too far\n- However, going DOWN moves me toward the center where snake #0 might approach\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (1, 7):** \n- \u2705 Safe! (1, 7) is empty\n- Moves me back toward the left wall\n- Limits future movement (only 3 directions from there: UP, DOWN, RIGHT)\n- Not ideal for board control\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3, 7):** \n- \u2705 Safe! (3, 7) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Would give me my first point AND grow my body\n- Moves me further right toward center\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI want to DOMINATE and trap snake #0, but I also need to start scoring! Both DOWN and RIGHT give me apples. \n\nHowever, RIGHT to (3, 7) is slightly better because:\n1. It positions me more centrally to control the board\n2. The apple at (3, 7) is reachable and safe\n3. From (3, 7) I can still access multiple areas\n4. Snake #0 is at bottom-right - I don't want to drift down toward his territory yet\n\n**Final call:** RIGHT to grab that apple and start building my lead! \ud83d\udc0d\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLet's get that first point and show snake #0 who's running this game!\n\nRIGHT",

(2, 8) is empty on the board\n- Opens up access to apple (3, 7) and (2, 6) nearby\n- Moves me toward the upper-left quadrant where I can control space\n- Keeps my options open - I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN from there\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2, 6):** \n- \u2705 Safe! (2, 6) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Would give me my first point and grow my body\n- BUT...

The board shows body at (7,8) as 'T', but in the scoreboard body list it shows [(7,8), (6,8), (5,8)]. That means my body occupies (7,8), (6,8), (5,8). My head is currently at (7,7) after last turn's DOWN move.\n- **Enemy head:** (7, 5) \u2014 just moved UP from (7,4) based on the board state (ID 0 at (7,5) now).\n- **Enemy body:** (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1) \u2014 Wait, the board shows '0' at (7,5), 'T' at (8,5). The body list says [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)]. So enemy head at (7,5), body at (8,5) to (8,2).\n\n**MOVES FROM (7,7):**\n- **UP \u2192 (7,8):** \u274c DEAD! That's my own body (first segment of tail, right above head). I die instantly. NOPE!\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,6):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty (board shows '.' at (7,6)). This keeps me in center.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,7):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty (board shows '.' at (6,7)).\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,7):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty (board shows '.' at (8,7)).\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy is at (7,5). Where can they go?\n- **UP \u2192 (7,6):** Possible. That's empty on board.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,4):** Possible. Empty.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,5):** Possible. Empty.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,5):** \u274c DEAD! That's their own body (first tail segment). They can't go right.\n\nSo enemy has 3 safe moves. If they go UP to (7,6), and I go DOWN to (7,6) simultaneously, we collide heads \u2014 both die. If I go DOWN and they go DOWN or LEFT, I'm safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC MINDSET:**\nI'm 3 apples vs their 4. I'm smaller (4 segments vs 5). I need to grow but more importantly, force a mistake or cut off their space.\n\n**BOXING IN STRAT:**\nEnemy is moving up into column 7. If I stay in column 7, we might risk head-on collision. But if I move LEFT to (6,7), I open up the left side and stay flexible. If I go DOWN to (7,6), I move toward potential apple (6,6) or (7,6) area.\n\nLet's check the apples nearby: (6,6) is an apple. (7,6) is empty. (6,7) is empty. (8,7) is empty.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,7):\n- Next turn from (6,7) I can go UP (6,8) \u2014 but (6,8) is my own body! Can't go up.\n- DOWN (6,6) \u2014 that's an apple! Growth opportunity.\n- LEFT (5,7) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT (7,7) \u2014 where I am now, empty.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,6):\n- Next turn from (7,6) I can go UP (7,7) \u2014 safe\n- DOWN (7,5) \u2014 occupied by enemy head! Dangerous\n- LEFT (6,6) \u2014 apple\n- RIGHT (8,6) \u2014 empty\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,7):\n- Next turn from (8,7) I can go UP (8,8) \u2014 empty\n- DOWN (8,6) \u2014 empty\n- LEFT (7,7) \u2014 safe\n- RIGHT (9,7) \u2014 apple? No, (9,6) is apple, (9,7) is empty\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nI want to maximize flexibility AND set up a trap. The enemy is at (7,5). If I go DOWN to (7,6), I'm moving directly into their potential path UP. If they go UP, we collide and both die. That's a double KO \u2014 not ideal since they have more apples. If they go DOWN or LEFT, I'm safe and closer to apple (6,6).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,7), I'm giving up column 7 entirely. The enemy might take it, grow, and dominate. But I open up the left side.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** The chat wants a CRUSH. I need to grow while maintaining position to cut them off. The apple at (6,6) is close and accessible from (7,6) or (6,7).\n\nLet's check if (6,6) is reachable and safe:\n- From (6,6), next moves: UP (6,7) \u2014 I could go there\n- DOWN (6,5) \u2014 enemy near here\n- LEFT (5,6) \u2014 empty\n- RIGHT (7,6) \u2014 my head\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,6) and enemy goes DOWN to (7,4) or LEFT to (6,5), I'm safe. If enemy goes UP to (7,6), double KO \u2014 bad for me (they have more apples). But wait, if both die, game ends immediately. Who wins? Rule: \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins. If tied? Draw.\"\n\nEnemy has 4 apples, I have 3. So double KO means THEY win. Not good.\n\nTherefore, I MUST avoid head-on collision with them at (7,6) this turn.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,6), and enemy goes UP to (7,6) simultaneously, we both die \u2014 they win. So that's a bad risk.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,7):\n- Enemy goes UP to (7,6) \u2014 safe for me\n- Enemy goes DOWN to (7,4) \u2014 safe for me\n- Enemy goes LEFT to (6,5) \u2014 safe for me\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,7):\n- Similar safety profile.\n\n**BEST MOVE:**\nAvoid the dangerous DOWN path to (7,6) since enemy might go UP there and kill me (or both die). LEFT or RIGHT are safer.\n\nBut which one sets up better future? LEFT to (6,7) opens up apple (6,6) DOWN next turn. RIGHT to (8,7) opens up (8,8) UP, (8,6) DOWN, etc.\n\nEnemy is in column 7 moving up. If I go LEFT to (6,7), I'm one step left of them. Next turn I could potentially trap them if they continue up.\n\nLet's think: if I go LEFT to (6,7) now, next turn:\n- Enemy at (7,5) might go UP to (7,6).\n- Then I'm at (6,7). I can go DOWN to (6,6) (apple) or RIGHT to (7,7).\n- If I go DOWN to (6,6) and they go UP to (7,6), we're not colliding. Good.\n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (6,5) from (7,5):\n- They move toward me. I'm at (6,7). They might go UP later.\n\nI think LEFT gives me more control. I can chase that apple (6,6) while staying flexible.\n\n**FINAL CALL:**\nAvoid DOWN to prevent potential double KO loss. Go LEFT to (6,7) to position for apple (6,6) and maintain board control. Stay aggressive but smart!\n\nLEFT",

TURN 9/150 - WE'RE LIVE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**STRATEGIC OVERVIEW:**\n- My snake: Head at (6,7), body [(7,7), (7,8), (6,8)] - I'm a solid 4-segment contender!\n- Enemy: Head at (7,6), body [(7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)] - 5 segments, 4 apples to my 3\n- Key insight: Enemy just moved UP to (7,6)! That's exactly where I was considering going last turn. Good thing I didn't go DOWN or we'd have collided! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- Enemy is now directly below my head at (7,6)\n- My body blocks: UP to (6,8) - my own body! Can't go there\n- Safe moves from (6,7):\n  * UP \u2192 (6,8): \u274c DEAD! My own body segment\n  * DOWN \u2192 (6,6): \u2705 SAFE! Contains an apple! (6,6) is listed in apple drops!\n  * LEFT \u2192 (5,7): \u2705 SAFE! Empty\n  * RIGHT \u2192 (7,7): \u2705 SAFE! That's my current position, now empty\n\n**ENEMY'S SITUATION:**\nEnemy at (7,6). Where can they go?\n- UP \u2192 (7,7): \u2705 SAFE! Empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5): \u274c DEAD! Their own body (first tail segment)\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6): \u2705 SAFE! That's the apple location!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,6): \u2705 SAFE! Empty\n\n**THE TRAP SETUP:**\nIf I go DOWN to (6,6) to eat the apple:\n- I grow to 5 segments (matching enemy)\n- If enemy goes LEFT to (6,6) simultaneously \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die \u2192 enemy wins (they have more apples 4-3)\n- If enemy goes UP to (7,7) or RIGHT to (8,6) \u2192 I'm safe and growing!\n\n**CALCULATED RISK:**\nThe enemy is more likely to go UP to (7,7) or RIGHT to (8,6) because:\n1. They want to avoid head-on collision (they don't know my move)\n2. Going LEFT to (6,6) risks collision and they're already ahead in apples\n3. UP moves them toward the top where there are more apples (0,8), (1,8), (0,9)\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:**\nI'm going for the apple at (6,6)! This:\n- Grows me to match their segment count\n- Keeps me close to enemy to pressure them\n- Opens up multiple escape routes from (6,6): LEFT(5,6), RIGHT(7,6), DOWN(6,5), UP(6,7)\n- If they avoid collision, I gain a point and close the score gap to 4-4!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nAfter eating at (6,6), I'll have 4 apples. Next turn from (6,6), I can:\n- Go LEFT to (5,6) \u2192 toward apple (5,2) or (3,3)\n- Go RIGHT to (7,6) \u2192 back toward enemy\n- Go DOWN to (6,5) \u2192 enemy territory\n- Go UP to (6,7) \u2192 retreat path\n\nI'm betting they play it safe and go UP to (7,7). If they do, I'm clear to eat and grow!\n\n**FINAL CALL:** DOWN to (6,6) - taking the apple and closing the score gap! LET'S GOOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",
