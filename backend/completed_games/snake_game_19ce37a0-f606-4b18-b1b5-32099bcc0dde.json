Let me check my position and the board state.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm at (5,1) with no body segments\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (6,0) with no body segments\n- Apples are at: (0,6), (1,9), (9,9), (3,6), (4,2)\n- The closest apple to me is (4,2) - just 1 space LEFT and 1 space UP from my current position\n\n**Available moves from (5,1):**\n- UP: (5,1) \u2192 (5,2) - Safe, moves toward apple at (4,2)\n- DOWN: (5,1) \u2192 (5,0) - This would cause a head-on collision with enemy snake at (6,0)? Wait, let me check... Enemy at (6,0) can move UP to (6,1), RIGHT to (7,0), or LEFT to (5,0). So if I move DOWN to (5,0) and enemy moves LEFT to (5,0), we'd collide. This is dangerous.\n- LEFT: (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) - Safe, moves toward apple at (4,2)\n- RIGHT: (5,1) \u2192 (6,1) - Safe, but moves away from apples\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\n- Enemy at (6,0) can move: UP to (6,1), RIGHT to (7,0), or LEFT to (5,0)\n- If I move DOWN to (5,0) and enemy moves LEFT to (5,0), we collide - both die. This is too risky.\n\n**Safe moves:**\n- UP to (5,2): Safe, moves toward apple\n- LEFT to (4,1): Safe, moves toward apple  \n- RIGHT to (6,1): Safe, but moves away from apple (worst option)\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, both move me closer to the apple at (4,2). LEFT brings me to (4,1) which is directly below the apple at (4,2), while UP brings me to (5,2). From (4,1), I can eat the apple on my next move. From (5,2), I'd be farther away.\n\n**Decision: LEFT** is the best move - it positions me directly below the apple at (4,2), allowing me to eat it on the next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (4,2), I should aim for the apple at (3,6) which will be relatively close. I need to be careful about the enemy snake's movements and avoid head-on collisions while maintaining mobility. The apples at (0,6) and (1,9) are also in the left side of the board, so staying on the left side seems like a good strategy for now.\n\nLEFT",
