It seems after last move (UP), the head moved from (3,5) to (3,4). But the previous position of the head was at (3,5), which was the apple location. Since the last move was UP, moving onto (3,5) would eat the apple there, and the snake would grow, so the tail would extend or remain the same if just one segment).\n\nActually, the last move was UP, bringing the head from (3,5) to (3,4). But according to the map, the snake's current position is at (3,4), and the body is at [(3,5)]. So perhaps the previous position was at (3,5), moved UP to (3,4), which is consistent.\n\nGiven that, the snake just ate the apple at (3,5), and now the head is at (3,4). (Wait, the apple was at (3,5). Moving UP from (3,4) would bring us onto (3,5). But the position info suggests the snake is now at (3,4), with body at [(3,5)]. That indicates our snake just moved UP onto (3,5), consuming the apple, and 'body' contains the previous position, which is (3,5). So, the snake just grew by consuming that apple.\n\nSummarizing:\n- Our head has just moved onto (3,5) (the apple).\n- Our body was previously at (3,5), now the head is at (3,5). This likely means we just ate the apple, and our snake grew longer.\n- The next position after this move will be at (3,5).\n\nLooking at the map:\n- Our snake positioned at (3,5 + 1) before last move: at (3,5). Previous position was at (3,4).\n\nAfter eating:\n- Our snake now is longer.\n- The previous body was at (3,5). Now, since we've just eaten, our head is at (3,5), and the body continues at previous segments (not fully shown), but for planning, the key is that the snake is now at (3,5).\n\nGoals:\n- Next, we want to move towards the next apple. The closest one seems to be at (1,4) or (6,6). Let's check options.\n\nFocus on safety:\n- Moving LEFT to (2,5) (if I considered previous position), but from current position (3,5), moving LEFT would go to (2,5), which is free.\n- Moving UP from (3,5) would go to (3,6), which is free but has an apple at (3,5), which we just ate. Next apple is at (6,6) or (8,7).\n\nSince samedirection is \"UP\" in last move, perhaps to continue towards apples in that direction:\n\n- Trying to reach (3,6): moving UP to (3,6) is safe.\n- Alternatively, to get closer to other apples, a better plan might be to move right or left.\n\nBut given the current map:\n- Moving UP: from (3,5) to (3,6). Cell (3,6) is empty or not occupied? The map shows no snake or apple positions there; it's clear.\n- Moving RIGHT from (3,5): (4,5) is empty.\n- Moving LEFT: (2,5) is empty.\n- Moving DOWN: (3,4), which is behind the snake, so moving DOWN is risky (going backward).\n\nBetween options:\n- Moving UP to (3,6): safe, proceeds toward the top row.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,5): safe, steps toward right.\n- Moving LEFT to (2,5): less favorable unless aiming to approach left-side apples.\n- Moving DOWN: not safe, as that would go back over previously occupied space.\n\nThe most promising immediate move:\n- Continue moving UP to get closer to the apple at (3,5), which we've just consumed, and then plan to move toward other apples.\n\nAlternatively, since the apple at (3,5) was just eaten, perhaps better to move towards the apple at (6,6):\n\n- To reach (6,6), we need to move right and up, but that might be longer. Given the current position at (3,5), moving RIGHT and then UP could be safe.\n\nConsidering safety and goals:\n- Moving UP to (3,6): safe.\n- From there, we can navigate further.\n\nSince no immediate dangers are present, and moving UP will continue towards the top of the play area, where other apples reside, I will decide to move UP.\n\n**Next move: UP**",
