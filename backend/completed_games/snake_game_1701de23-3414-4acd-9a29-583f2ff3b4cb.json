We're LIVE and ready to dominate this snake battle! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Let's break down the board and plan our attack.\n\n**ANALYSIS TIME:**\n- **My Position:** (6, 8) - Head is at row 8, column 6\n- **Enemy Position:** (5, 9) - Head is at row 9, column 5 (directly above me, separated by one row)\n- **Apple Locations:** We have a TON of apples scattered, but the closest ones to me are:\n  - (7, 7) - ONE cell RIGHT and DOWN from me\n  - (6, 6) - Wait, is there an apple at (6,6)? Looking at the board...\n  - Actually looking at the board state: Row 6 has apples at (0,6) and (1,6) and (7,6) and (8,2)\n  - Row 7 has apples at (7,7) and (1,7)\n  - The apple at (7,7) is adjacent to me!\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION:**\n1. **UP to (6,9):** That's the edge of the board! Moving up would put me at the top wall. Also, the enemy is at (5,9) - if they move RIGHT, they'd be at (6,9) and we'd collide! This is risky. Plus, being against the wall limits my future moves. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (6,7):** This looks SAFE! (6,7) is empty. This moves me toward the apple at (7,7) and gives me more board space. This seems solid. \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (5,8):** This is SAFE - it's empty. Moves me toward the apple at (7,7) indirectly. But wait, the enemy is at (5,9) above. If they move DOWN, they'd be at (5,8) - same cell! That's a head-on collision. Since both our heads would end up in the same cell, we'd BOTH die. That's a risk, but I have 0 apples vs 0 apples, so tied score. In a tie, it's a draw. But I want to WIN, not draw. So let's avoid this. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (7,8):** This is SAFE - (7,8) is empty. But wait! If I move RIGHT to (7,8), I'm moving directly toward the enemy's potential path. And there's an apple at (7,7) which would be one more move away. Also, this puts me closer to the right edge. Hmm. \u2705 but not ideal.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI'm choosing **DOWN** to (6,7). Here's why:\n- It's completely safe - no immediate collision risk\n- It positions me perfectly to grab the apple at (7,7) on my NEXT move (I'd be at (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7))\n- It keeps me away from the enemy's immediate area (they're at (5,9))\n- It gives me more breathing room and future options in the center of the board\n- I avoid the wall and potential traps\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab that apple at (7,7) next turn, then start circling the board to control territory. The enemy is at the top - I'll use my position to cut off their access to lower apples and force them into a corner. We're playing the long game, chat!\n\nLet's move!\n\nDOWN",

Immediate death. Nope. \u274c\n- DOWN -> (5,8): empty now, BUT opponent at (6,8) can go LEFT -> (5,8) this turn and cause a head-on collision (double KO). We\u2019re tied 0-0 \u2014 don\u2019t trade lives for nothing. Risky. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT -> (6,9): empty, but opponent can go UP -> (6,9) and force a head-on. Also risky. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT -> (4,9): there\u2019s an apple there. Safe \u2014 opponent CANNOT reach (4,9) this turn from (6,8). We eat, grow, and immediately gain a scoring/positional edge. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n\n2) Eliminate suicidal moves: UP is illegal, DOWN and RIGHT are avoidable risks since they allow a one-move head-on from the enemy. We prefer to AVOID a potential double KO when scores are tied.\n\n3) Best move: LEFT \u2014 eat the apple at (4,9). We get +1, grow (which gives us a body segment occupying (5,9) next turn), and increase our ability to force or threaten collisions from a position of advantage.\n\nShort-term plan for next few turns (for the \"last rationale\" next turn):\n- After LEFT (apple), use the extra segment to control the top row and pressure the opponent downwards. Don\u2019t head straight into risky head-on trades \u2014 force them into tighter space and only commit to collisions when we have the higher score.\n- Use the top row and left-side apples to grow while keeping an escape route open (don\u2019t get boxed on the left edge). If enemy chases, pivot down and circle to cut off their exits. Be aggressive, punish greed. \ud83d\ude08\n\nLET\u2019S GO \u2014 LEFT",

Moving up puts me at row 8, column 6. Wait, looking at the board state, row 8 shows all dots (empty). The enemy is at (4,9) - if they move DOWN, they'd be at (4,8). No immediate collision. But being against the wall (row 8 is one below the top wall at row 9) limits my future moves. Not ideal. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (6, 6):** This looks SAFE! (6, 6) is empty on the board. This moves me DOWN toward the apple at (7,7) indirectly, and keeps me in the center. Gives me more board space. \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (5, 7):** This is SAFE - it's empty. Moves me toward the enemy's area but also toward apples. The enemy is at (4,9), so if they move DOWN, they'd be at (4,8) - not a collision. If they move RIGHT, they'd be at (5,9) - still safe. This keeps me central. \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 7):** BOOM! There's an apple RIGHT HERE! (7, 7) is an apple drop. If I move RIGHT, I eat the apple and grow! This is SAFE - no body collision. The enemy is far enough that they can't reach this cell this turn (they're at (4,9), would need to move 3 cells right AND down). This gives me my first point and grows my snake! \ud83d\udd25 \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI'm choosing **RIGHT** to (7, 7). Here's why:\n- IMMEDIATE APPLE! I get +1 point and grow by 1 segment\n- It's completely safe - no collision risk\n- The enemy is at (4,9) - they're NOT close enough to threaten this cell this turn\n- This gives me momentum and confidence\n- After eating, I'll have a longer body (currently I'm just a head, so after eating I'll be head at (7,7) and body at (6,7))\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter grabbing this apple, I'll be at (7,7) with a body segment at (6,7). The enemy has 1 apple already, so I need to catch up. I'll start positioning myself to control the right side of the board and cut off the enemy's access to the apples in the top-right region.

Illegal \u2014 instant self-death. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (3,9): safe, holds the top row and keeps pressure, but it\u2019s a bit passive and limits immediate approach options.\n- DOWN -> (4,8): safe, moves us closer to the enemy, keeps multiple follow-up options (L/R/D), and lets us start squeezing them while we have the score advantage.\n\nEnemy read: Opp at (6,7). Their easiest grab is RIGHT -> (7,7) (apple). If we sit back and do nothing, they can snag apples and catch up. We want to be aggressive but smart \u2014 we have 1 apple; head-on trades favor us. So we should move to threaten and limit their safe apple grabs while keeping multiple escape routes.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN to (4,8) now to start closing vertical distance while retaining lateral options.\n- Next turns: push to (4,7) to threaten the lane around (5,7).

We just ate an apple at (7,7) last turn, so now our head is at (7,7) with body at (6,7). Enemy snake #1 is at (4,8) with body at (4,9). Both snakes have 1 apple each - we're tied.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** Head at (7,7), Body at (6,7) - so I can't move back to (6,7) directly (that's backwards into my own body)\n- **Enemy Position:** Head at (4,8), Body at (4,9) \n- **Board State:** Apple at (7,6) is DOWN from me, apple at (9,5) is RIGHT and DOWN, apple at (8,2) is far RIGHT and DOWN\n- **Enemy Path:** Enemy is at (4,8), could move DOWN to (4,7), RIGHT to (5,8), UP to (4,9) is into their own body, or LEFT to (3,8)\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION:**\n1. **UP to (7,8):** This would be toward the top wall. Looking at board state, row 8 shows dots (empty). But if enemy moves RIGHT to (5,8), they'd be at (5,8) - not immediate collision. However, I'd be getting closer to their path. Safe but limits mobility. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (7,6):** BOOM! There's an apple at (7,6)! This is DOWN from me. Check safety: (7,6) is empty on board. My body is at (6,7) so no self-collision. Enemy at (4,8) can't reach (7,6) this turn (needs to move 3 right + 2 down). This gives me another apple and grows me! \ud83d\udd25 \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (6,7):** This is where my body is - I'd be moving into my own body! That's a death sentence. INSTANT NO. \u274c DEAD\n4. **RIGHT to (8,7):** This is empty on board. But this moves me away from the apple at (7,6) and toward no immediate apple. While safe, it's not optimal for scoring. The enemy is at (4,8) - they can't reach me this turn. But why move away from food? \u274c\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI'm choosing **DOWN** to (7,6). Here's why:\n- IMMEDIATE APPLE! Another +1 point and growth\n- Completely safe - no collision risk  \n- Enemy is far away at (4,8) - can't threaten this cell\n- I'm now at 2 apples vs enemy's 1 - taking the lead!\n- After eating, my body will be [(7,7), (6,7)] - growing strategically\n- This keeps me in the central-right area for future apple hunting\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter grabbing this apple, I'll be at (7,6) with body [(7,7), (6,7)]. I need to watch enemy's movement - if they go DOWN toward (4,7), I might want to cut them off from apples in the bottom-right. Next turn, I'll look toward apples at (9,5) or (8,2) while keeping enemy boxed in the top-left corner. Time to extend my lead!\n\nDOWN",

Their plausible moves: UP (7,8), RIGHT (8,7), or DOWN (7,6) to grab that apple. They won\u2019t be forcing a head-on into us this turn unless we stupidly step into a spot they can also reach (not happening right now). We\u2019re tied 1\u20131, so we don\u2019t want a risky mutual KO.\n\n3) Tactical choice:\n- LEFT is too passive \u2014 sidelines us and reduces pressure.\n- RIGHT keeps central space and flexibility, but it\u2019s a little sideways; we\u2019d need another turn to threaten them.\n- DOWN immediately puts us on the same row (y=7) as the enemy, enabling a fast push to (5,7) next turn to start corralling their movement and cutting off apple lanes. It\u2019s the most aggressive, keeps multiple exit routes, and sets up baiting a head-on later only if the score favors us.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns): drop to (4,7) now, then probe right to (5,7) to begin boxing their left flank. If they drop for the apple at (7,6), we close from the left and deny space; if they try to run right/up, we mirror and compress. Avoid any direct face-to-face unless we lead on apples.\n\nTime to pressure \u2014 let\u2019s close the gap and make them sweat. DOWN",

But my body is at (6,7) - if I go LEFT to (6,6), I'm not moving into my body. Wait, body is at (7,7) and (6,7) - so (6,6) is safe from self-collision. Enemy can't reach. But this moves me away from the apple cluster at (9,5), (9,2), (8,3) etc. Safe but not optimal. \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (8,6):** Empty on board! No self-collision. Enemy can't reach.

Enemy is stuck at (4,7) with only (4,6) or (5,7) as safe moves (up goes into wall, left is edge). I'm going to keep them boxed in the top-left while I feast on the right-side apples.

No mutual suicide plays. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nTactical reasoning & short plan:\n- We want pressure and more board control while keeping escape routes. RIGHT to (5,7) pushes us toward their flank, keeps multiple follow-ups (up/right/down), and starts compressing their space without risking a head-on this turn. LEFT is passive; DOWN is OK but slower to press. We avoid any move that could become a forced head-on while they can increase their lead by eating.\n- Short-term plan: Move RIGHT now to (5,7), then probe to (6,7) only if we can guarantee that cell will be free (i.e., opponent didn\u2019t eat). If they go for the apple and grow, instead pivot down/up to choke exits and box them later. Play aggressive but don\u2019t trade lives when we\u2019re behind on apples. \ud83c\udfaf\n\nFinal move \u2014 keep it tight, keep options open, force them to make the risky play.\n\nRIGHT",

Top wall is y=9, so from (8,7) I can go UP to (8,8) eventually. Not a trap yet.\n- **DOWN to (8,5):** Directly toward apple at (8,3) and (9,5). This is aggressive! From (8,5), I can go DOWN to (8,4), then to (8,3) for an apple. Also, from (8,5) I can go RIGHT to (9,5) to eat that apple. This position keeps options open.\n- **RIGHT to (9,6):** Directly toward apple at (9,5) (just one down). But from (9,6), I'm on the far right edge\u2014future options limited (can't go RIGHT). Might get boxed in if enemy somehow encroaches (unlikely). But it's close to apple (9,5).\n\n**Compare options:**\n- **UP (8,7):** Safe, but moves me away from immediate apple threats? Not really\u2014I can still chase later. But it's moving UP into the top area, which might be empty but could limit mobility if I go too high.\n- **DOWN (8,5):** Moves me TOWARD apples: (8,3) is 2 DOWN, (9,5) is 1 RIGHT then 1 DOWN. Keeps me central-right. Good for future moves.\n- **RIGHT (9,6):** Closest to apple (9,5) (just DOWN next turn). But limits rightward escape.\n\n**AGGRESSION MODE:** I'm leading, so I should push for more apples to extend lead. Enemy is stuck, so I can safely go for (9,5) apple. From current (8,6), **DOWN to (8,5)** puts me in a position where I can either go RIGHT to (9,5) next turn or continue DOWN to chase (8,3). This keeps multiple paths open and advances toward the apple cluster.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (8,5), I'll be positioned to either go RIGHT to (9,5) to eat that apple (grow my lead to 3-1) or continue DOWN to (8,4) to go for (8,3). Meanwhile, enemy at (5,7) has limited moves\u2014likely will be forced to move RIGHT or DOWN, keeping them boxed in the top-left quadrant. I'll maintain pressure and trap them against walls.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**  \nUP is safe but slower. RIGHT limits future moves. LEFT kills me. **DOWN to (8,5)** is optimal: aggressive, positions me for apple consumption, and keeps my options wide open. Let's eat!\n\nDOWN",

Quick, sharp read and then we commit.\n\n1) All 4 directions from head (5,7):\n- UP -> (5,8): legal, empty. Keeps lots of options (can go top or swing right/left later). Safe. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (5,6): legal, empty. Moves toward the center \u2014 fine for pressure. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (4,7): ILLEGAL \u2014 that\u2019s our neck (backwards). \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (6,7): legal, empty. Directly pressures enemy flank and sets up a box. \u2705\n\n2) Opponent read (head at 8,6; neck at 7,6):\n- They cannot move LEFT (backwards into 7,6). Their realistic moves: UP (8,7), RIGHT (9,6), DOWN (8,5). None of those collide with any of our three legal next-head cells this turn, so no immediate head-on threat. Good \u2014 we can be aggressive without risking mutual KO. \ud83d\ude08\n\n3) Tactical pick rationale:\n- We\u2019re down 1 apple (1 vs 2) \u2014 so don\u2019t force a head-on unless we lead. But be aggressive on space control.\n- UP is safe and roomy, DOWN is fine but slower to flank. RIGHT (to 6,7) is the aggressive play: it pressures the enemy\u2019s near side, threatens to take (7,7) on the following turn once their tail vacates, and lets us pivot into (6,6) or (6,8) to cut exits. It still leaves multiple follow-ups so we\u2019re not boxed in immediately. That\u2019s perfect for setting up a trap. \ud83c\udfaf\n\nShort-term plan (for replay next turn):\n- Move RIGHT to (6,7) now. If their tail at (7,7) vacates (they won\u2019t eat this turn), threaten to move into (7,7) to compress their space. If they try to escape right/up, pivot down towards (6,6)/(5,6) to seal off exits. NEVER accept a head-on unless we flip the apple count advantage. Keep our body small but positional \u2014 grow only when it helps box them.\n\nLET\u2019S PRESS \u2014 make them sweat.

We\u2019re down 1 apple (1 vs 2) \u2014 avoid suicidal head-ons.\n\nTactical takeaway: UP is the safest for options, DOWN and RIGHT press toward the apple cluster. I want to be aggressive and compress space without risking a head-on. RIGHT to (7,7) puts pressure on their left flank and threatens to cut off their escape corridor above them next turn, while still leaving multiple exits for us.

Let's break down this board state and secure the bag.\n\n**CURRENT STATE SNAPSHOT:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 4) - I'm on the right edge, baby!\n- **My Body:** [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)] - Check the board: row 5 shows \"A . . . . . . . . 0\" - Wait, hold up. Let me read this board correctly. The \"T\" markings seem to be my body, and \"0\" is my head. Let me trace:\n  - Row 9: \". . . . . . . . A .\" - (8,9) is apple.\n  - Row 8: \". . . . . . . . . .\"\n  - Row 7: \". A . . . . . T 1 .\" - (7,7) is enemy head \"1\", (8,7) is my body \"T\".\n  - Row 6: \"A A . A . . . T T .\" - (8,6) and (9,6) are my body \"T\".\n  - Row 5: \". . . A . . . A T T\" - (8,5) and (9,5) are my body \"T\". BUT WAIT, my head is at (9,4) according to the stats. Let me check row 4.\n  - Row 4: \". . . . . . . . . 0\" - (9,4) is my head \"0\".\n  - Row 3: \". . . . . . A . A A\"\n  - Row 2: \". . . . . . . . A A\"\n  - Row 1: \"A . . . . . . . . A\"\n  - Row 0: \". . . . . A . . . .\"\n\nSo my body is at: (9,5), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6). Tail at (7,6). Enemy head at (8,7), body at (7,7). Apples: (8,9), (7,7) is enemy but also apple? No, (7,7) is enemy head. (7,5) is apple. (3,5) apple. (8,2) apple. (0,1) apple. (9,3) apple. (9,2) apple. (8,3) apple. (5,0) apple. (6,3) apple. (9,1) apple. (1,7) apple. (0,6) apple. (1,6) apple. (9,1) apple. (3,6) apple. (8,9) apple. Wait, the list is: (7,5), (9,2), (3,5), (1,6), (0,6), (8,2), (5,0), (8,3), (0,1), (1,7), (9,1), (6,3), (9,3), (3,6), (8,9). \n\nFrom (9,4), apples at (9,3), (9,2), (9,1) are below me. Also (8,3) is left-down.\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**\nFrom head (9,4):\n- **UP to (9,5):** My own body segment. DEAD.\n- **DOWN to (9,3):** Empty? Check board: row 3, col 9 is \"A\". Yes! Apple at (9,3). SAFE and EATS.\n- **LEFT to (8,4):** Empty. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT to (10,4):** Off board. DEAD.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\nI have 4 apples, enemy has 1. I'm dominating. I need to keep the pressure on and secure more apples while not trapping myself.\n\n- **LEFT to (8,4):** Moves me into the center-left of the board. From there, I can access (8,3) apple, (7,5) apple, (9,2) is far. But... I risk getting closer to the enemy at (8,7). The enemy is at (8,7) and (7,7). If I go left to (8,4), I'm on the same column as the enemy. The enemy could move down to (8,6) or (8,5), which might collide with my body. But wait, my body is at (9,5), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6). If enemy moves to (8,6), it's my body! So enemy dies. If enemy moves to (8,5), it's also my body. So actually, moving LEFT might be dangerous for the enemy. However, I need to consider where the enemy *will* move. The enemy is at (8,7). Options for enemy: UP (8,8), DOWN (8,6) -> my body, LEFT (7,7) -> its own body, RIGHT (9,7). If enemy goes RIGHT to (9,7), that's open. If enemy goes UP, that's open. If enemy goes DOWN, it dies on my body. If enemy goes LEFT, it dies on its own body. So enemy is likely to go UP or RIGHT to survive. \n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,4), I put myself in a position where if the enemy goes RIGHT to (9,7), we are not colliding. If enemy goes UP to (8,8), no collision. However, if I stay on the right edge, I'm safer from the enemy. The enemy is in the top-left quadrant. My body blocks a lot of space.\n\n- **DOWN to (9,3):** This is an apple. It grows me. It keeps me on the right edge, which is a safe corridor. From (9,3), I can continue down to (9,2) (apple), then (9,1) (apple). This is a clear path of three apples. This is excellent resource generation and keeps me away from the enemy.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\nLEFT gives me access to scattered apples (8,3, 7,5, etc.) but brings me closer to the enemy's potential movement path (vertical corridor at x=8). \nDOWN gives me a guaranteed apple NOW and a straight line of 2 more apples immediately following. It keeps me on the edge, reducing collision points with the enemy.\n\n**AGGRESSION & BOARD DOMINATION:**\nI have a 4-1 lead. I don't need to chase the enemy down immediately. I need to grow and secure my territory. The right edge is MINE. Chaining eats down the right edge maximizes my score safely. Once I have a massive lead (like 7-1), I can consider closing in on the enemy to force a head-on collision or trap them.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (9,3) -> (9,2) -> (9,1). That's +3 apples. I'll be at 7 apples. My body will extend down the right edge. I need to be careful not to trap myself at the bottom-left corner eventually, but for now, this is the safest highest-value path. After eating (9,1), I'll likely need to turn left into the center to avoid the wall at (9,0), but that's 3 turns away. Plenty of time to plan.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN to (9,3) is the move. It's safe, it's an apple, and it sets up a chain eat.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT!** Watch me eat this apple and turn into a massive snake! The enemy is watching from the corner, scared! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

From (8,3), I can see apples at (7,5), (6,3), (5,0), (8,2), (9,2), etc. However, moving left brings me closer to the enemy's vertical column (x=8). The enemy is at (8,8).

So if the enemy moves down, they hit my body and die. That's actually good for me! But if they move left or right, we don't collide.\n- **DOWN (9,2):** Moves me down the right edge. I eat an apple. From (9,2), I see apples at (9,1) and (9,0) (if it were an apple, but row 0 has an apple at (5,0)). Actually, looking at row 2, col 9 is \"A\". Row 1, col 9 is \"A\". Row 0, col 9 is \".\".\n- **The Plan:** The right edge is a highway. Moving DOWN keeps me on the edge, which is the safest place to be. It avoids crossing the enemy's potential path immediately.\n- **Comparison:**\n  - Left (8,3): Gains apple. Exposes me slightly more to the center.\n  - Down (9,2): Gains apple. Keeps me on the safe edge.\n- **Aggression:** I'm winning 5-1. I don't need to rush into a collision. I need to secure points. The right edge has a chain of apples: (9,3), (9,2), (9,1). I should take them.\n- **Enemy Movement:** Enemy is at (8,8). Their options are UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), LEFT (7,8), RIGHT (9,8).\n  - (8,9) is an apple.\n  - (8,7) is currently empty.\n  - (7,8) is empty.\n  - (9,8) is empty.\n  - They are likely to go for the apple at (8,9) or just move around. They aren't threatening me immediately.\n\n**Decision:**\nI am at (9,3). The apple is actually at (9,3)? No, wait.\nBoard row 3: `. . . . . . A . A A`\nMy head is at (9,3).\nThe cell (9,3) contains an apple (\"A\").\nWait, if my head is at (9,3) and it's an apple, I have already eaten it this turn?\nThe prompt says \"Turn: 8\".\nThe state shown is the *start* of Turn 8.\nMy head is at (9,3).\nThe board shows (9,3) is an Apple.\nSo I am currently *on* an apple.\nIf I move, I leave the apple.\nDid I eat it?\nUsually, you eat an apple by moving *onto* it.\nThe prompt says \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL... Head: (9,3)\".\nIf I am at (9,3) and it's an apple, I must have just eaten it to get there, or the apple is there and I'm about to eat it?\nLet's look at my score. I have 5 apples.\nLet's look at the apple list. (9,3) is in the list.\nIf I am standing on it, did I eat it?\nIf I didn't eat it, and I move, I lose the opportunity?\nActually, if I am standing on (9,3), and (9,3) is an apple, I should have eaten it when I moved there.\nLet's assume I am currently *on* the apple and it provides the benefit.\nIf I am *on* the apple, I don't need to stay there.\nI need to move to the next cell.\nThe apples listed are available on the board.\n(9,3) is an apple.\n(9,2) is an apple.\n(9,1) is an apple.\n(8,3) is an apple.\n\nIf I am at (9,3), and I want to eat another apple, I should go to (9,2) or (8,3).\nIf I go DOWN to (9,2), I eat the apple there.\nIf I go LEFT to (8,3), I eat the apple there.\n\nLet's look at the \"Last Move\" rationale.\nLast turn (Turn 7), I was at (9,4).\nI moved DOWN.\nThat landed me at (9,3).\nThe rationale said: \"DOWN to (9,3): This is an apple.\"\nSo yes, moving to (9,3) was the move for Turn 7.\nNow it is Turn 8.\nI am at (9,3).\nThe apple at (9,3) is presumably eaten.\nNow I look at my options.\n\n**Re-evaluating Moves from (9,3):**\n\n1. **UP to (9,4):**\n   - My body is at (9,4). **DEAD.**\n\n2. **RIGHT to (10,3):**\n   - Off board. **DEAD.**\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,3):**\n   - Cell (8,3) contains an apple (\"A\").\n   - Cell (8,3) is empty of snakes.\n   - **Safe. Eat Apple.** +1 Score.\n\n4. **DOWN to (9,2):**\n   - Cell (9,2) contains an apple (\"A\").\n   - Cell (9,2) is empty of snakes.\n   - **Safe. Eat Apple.** +1 Score.\n\n**Strategy Comparison:**\n- **LEFT to (8,3):** Moves into column 8. Enemy is in column 8 (at 8,8). My body occupies (8,5) and (8,6). If Enemy moves down to (8,7) or (8,6), they die. This is good. However, moving LEFT puts me in the middle of the board. From (8,3), I am open to more directions, but also more dangerous spots.\n- **DOWN to (9,2):** Stays on the edge. The right edge is a \"safe zone\" because only one direction (LEFT) is open, reducing collision vectors. From (9,2), I can continue to (9,1) next turn.\n- **Enemy Status:** Enemy has 1 apple. I have 5. I am dominating. I want to secure the \"easy\" apples on the right edge.\n- **The Chain:** (9,3) -> (9,2) -> (9,1) are apples.\n- **Risk Assessment:**\n  - If I go LEFT, I am at (8,3). From there, I might be forced into a tighter spot or have to cross back.\n  - If I go DOWN, I am at (9,2). I still have (9,1) available next. This is a clear path.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will go **DOWN** to (9,2).\nWhy? Because it secures the apple at (9,2) and keeps me on the right edge, which is the safest corridor. The left move is tempting, but putting my head in column 8 where the enemy is and where my body is anchored (8,5/8,6) is slightly more complex. Staying on the edge simplifies the game and guarantees a point.\n\n**Plan:**\nTurn 8: Move DOWN to (9,2), eat apple.\nTurn 9: Move DOWN to (9,1), eat apple.\nThen I'll have to figure out where to go after (9,1), as (9,0) is empty.\n\nLet's verify the board one last time to ensure (9,2) is an apple.\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . A A`\nCol 9, Row 2 is \"A\". Yes.\nRow 1, Col 9 is \"A\".\nRow 0, Col 9 is \".\".\n\nSo the path is clear.\nEnemy is at (8,8).\nEnemy options: (8,9), (7,8), (9,8), (8,7).\n(8,9) is an apple.\nIf enemy goes to (8,9), they eat.\nIf enemy goes to (8,7), they are next to my body at (8,6) and (8,5).\nActually, my body is at (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6).\nWait, the \"Body\" list in the prompt is `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)]`.\nSo (8,6) is a body segment.\nIf enemy moves to (8,7), they are safe.\nIf enemy moves to (8,6), they hit my body and die.\nEnemy is likely to go for the apple at (8,9) or (7,8) (if it were an apple, but it's empty).\nActually, looking at the apple list, (8,9) is an apple.\n(7,8) is empty.\n(9,8) is empty.\n(8,7) is empty.\n(7,7) is empty (but the board shows \"1\" there, which is the enemy head).\nWait, the board shows Row 7: `. A . . . . . T 1 .`\n(7,7) is \"T\" (My body).\n(8,7) is \"1\" (Enemy Head).\nWait, the board representation in the prompt:\n`7 . A . . . . . T 1 .`\nCols: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(7,7) is T? No, (8,7) is T? No.\nLet's look at the coordinates.\nRow 7. Cols 0-9.\nThe string is: `. A . . . . .

A . . . . . T 1 .`\nLet's count the dots.\n`. A . . . . . T 1 .`\n1. .\n2. A\n3. .\n4. .\n5. .\n6. .\n7. .\n8. T\n9. 1\n10. .\nThis is 10 characters.\n(0,7) to (9,7).\n(7,7) corresponds to the 8th character (index 7).\nThat character is `T`.\nSo the board *claims* (7,7) is a body segment.\nIf my body list says (7,6), then (7,6) is a body segment.\n(7,6) is Row 6.\nRow 6: `A A . A . . . T T .`\nIndices: 0:A, 1:A, 2:., 3:A, 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:T, 8:T, 9:.\nSo (7,6) is `T` (Index 7).\n(8,6) is `T` (Index 8).\n(9,6) is `.` (Index 9).\nWait, the body list has (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6).\nLet's check Row 5: `. . . A . . . A T T`\nIndices: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:A, 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:A, 8:T, 9:T.\n(8,5) is `T`. (9,5) is `T`. Matches.\nRow 4: `. . . . . . . . . 0`\n(9,4) is `0`. Matches.\nRow 6: `A A . A . . . T T .`\n(7,6) is `T`. (8,6) is `T`. (9,6) is `.`.\nMy body list has (7,6) and (8,6). It does NOT have (9,6).\nWait, the body list is `(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)`.\nThat is 5 segments.\nThe visual T's:\nRow 5: (8,5), (9,5)\nRow 6: (7,6), (8,6)\nRow 4: (9,4) (Head)\nTotal 5.\nThe visual (7,7) T is suspicious.\nIf (7,7) is T, that's a 6th segment?\nOr maybe (7,7) is just an artifact of the text rendering?\n`7 . A . . . . . T 1 .`\nMaybe the `T` is at (8,7)? No, index 8 is `1`.\nIndex 7 is `T`.\nSo (7,7) is `T`.\nBut the list doesn't include (7,7).\nPerhaps the board visual is slightly shifted or incorrect?\nHowever, I must rely on the data provided.\nThe text lists my body explicitly.\nThe visual is a representation.\nI will trust the text list for collision purposes.\nIf the text list says (7,6), then (7,6) is occupied.\n(7,7) is *not* in the list, so I assume it's empty in the simulation logic, despite the visual artifact.\n\n**Back to the decision:**\nI am at (9,3).\nOption A: Left to (8,3).\nOption B: Down to (9,2).\n\nIf I go Left to (8,3):\nI am in column 8.\nEnemy is at (8,8).\nMy body is at (8,5) and (8,6).\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (8,7), they are safe.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (8,6), they die.\nIf I am at (8,3), I am far from the enemy.\nHowever, (8,3) is an apple.\nFrom (8,3), I can go to (7,3), (8,2), (8,4), (9,3).\n(8,2) is an apple.\n(9,3) is empty (since I left it).\n(7,3) is empty.\n(8,4) is empty.\n\nIf I go Down to (9,2):\nI am in column 9.\nFrom (9,2), I can go to (9,1), (9,3), (8,2).\n(9,1) is an apple.\n(9,3) is empty.\n(8,2) is an apple.\n\nThe right edge seems safer because I am on the wall.\nThe left option (8,3) puts me in the middle of the board (well, column 8 is near the wall, but not the wall).\nActually, column 9 is the right wall.\nColumn 0 is the left wall.\nColumn 8 is one step away from the wall.\nThe visual shows column 9 is mostly empty except for my tail.\nStaying on the wall (Column 9) is generally safer because you can't be approached from the right.\n\nLet's look at the apple list again.\nApples: (7, 5), (9, 2), (3, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6), (8, 2), (5, 0), (8, 3), (0, 1), (1, 7), (9, 1), (6, 3), (3, 6), (8, 9), (7, 4).\n(9,2) is an apple.\n(9,1) is an apple.\n(8,3) is an apple.\n(8,2) is an apple.\n\nThe \"Down\" path gives me (9,2) -> (9,1).\nThe \"Left\" path gives me (8,3) -> (8,2).\nBoth paths give 2 apples.\nBut the \"Down\" path keeps me on the wall.\nThe \"Left\" path moves me to column 8.\nIf I go to column 8, I am exposed to the center.\nIf I stay on column 9, I am safe from the right.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy.\nEnemy at (8,8).\nIf I go to (8,3), I am in the same column.\nIf the enemy moves down, they might block my path or force a collision later.\nIf I stay on (9,2), I am separated by the wall and my own body (mostly).\nActually, my body blocks (8,5) and (8,6).\nIf I go to (8,3), I am below my own body wall.\nFrom (8,3), I can go to (8,4). But (8,4) is empty.\nWait, (8,4) is empty.\n(8,5) is body.\nSo if I go to (8,3), I can go to (8,4) next.\nThen I am adjacent to my body at (8,5).\nThat's a safe spot (entering the body tunnel).\nBUT, the enemy is at (8,8).\nIf the enemy moves down to (8,7), then to (8,6)...\nWait, (8,6) is my body. So enemy dies if they go to (8,6).\n(8,7) is empty.\nIf I am at (8,4), and enemy is at (8,7), there is a gap.\nIf I go to (8,3), I am eating an apple.\nIf I go to (9,2), I am eating an apple.\n\nLet's look at the score. 5 vs 1.\nI am winning.\nI want to secure points without risk.\nThe right edge seems lower risk.\nThe left move (8,3) is slightly higher risk because it involves moving into column 8, where the enemy has a presence.\n\nWait, I should check the board again for (9,2).\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . A A`\n(8,2) is A.\n(9,2) is A.\nIf I go to (9,2), I am at (9,2).\nNext turn I can go to (9,1) (Apple) or (8,2) (Apple).\nIf I go to (8,2), I am moving left into column 8.\nIf I go to (9,1), I stay on the wall.\n\nLet's decide.\nI will move **DOWN** to (9,2).\nReason: Staying on the right wall minimizes threats. The apple is there. It's a simple, efficient move.\n\nOne check: Is (9,2) safe from enemy heads?\nEnemy head is at (8,8).\nDistance is 6 squares.\nEnemy cannot reach (9,2) in one turn.\nSo it is safe.\n\nIs (8,3) safe from enemy heads?\nEnemy at (8,8). Distance is 5 squares vertically. Safe.\n\nIs (8,3) safe from my body?\nMy body is at (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6).\n(8,3) is clear.\n\nIs (9,2) safe from my body?\nYes.\n\nSo both are safe.\nI prefer the wall.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n1. Move DOWN to (9,2).\n2. Eat apple.\n3. Prepare to move to (9,1) or (8,2) next.\n\nLet's write theYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 8, let's keep the momentum going! We're sitting pretty at 5-1, but we need to secure more territory.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 3)\n- **Board Analysis:**\n  - **UP (9,4):** My own body. **DEAD.**\n  - **LEFT (8,3):** Apple present. Safe.\n  - **DOWN (9,2):** Apple present. Safe.\n  - **RIGHT (Off Board):** **DEAD.**\n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\nWe have two juicy apples waiting for us: (8,3) and (9,2).\n- **LEFT to (8,3):** Moves me into the center column. While it's an apple, it brings me closer to the enemy's vertical corridor at x=8. The enemy is at (8,8). If I go to (8,3), I'm sharing a column with them. While my body at (8,5) and (8,6) acts as a wall, it's riskier to engage the center too early.\n- **DOWN to (9,2):** Keeps me glued to the right wall. This is the **safest play**. The right edge is my territory. From (9,2), I have a clear path to (9,1) next turn, and then (9,0) or (8,2) after that. It guarantees another point without exposing my flank to the enemy.\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\nI'm winning 5-1. I don't need to rush into the middle of the board where the enemy is lurking. I need to hoard apples and grow my length. The right wall is a highway of points. Let's take the apple at (9,2), stay on the edge, and force the enemy to come to us if they want a fight.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 8: Eat (9,2).\nTurn 9: Eat (9,1).\nTurn 10: Assess the board from the bottom-right corner. Plan to sweep left across the bottom row to clear out the apples at (5,0), (0,1), etc., while keeping my body as a wall separating the enemy from the right side.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

No drama. \u2716\n- Opponent head at (9,2) \u2014 they\u2019re down in the bottom-right picking apples (8,2) or (9,1). They\u2019re not an immediate head-on threat this turn, but they\u2019ve got more apples (6 vs 1) so we must AVOID forcing mutual head-on. We want space and options to box them later.\n\nMove-by-move thinking (fast & loud for the stream):\n- UP -> (7,9): eats no apple now, but pins us to the top row. Only 2 non-backwards exits next turn. Tempting if we want the (8,9) apple, but it reduces mobility. Risky. \ud83e\uddf1\n- RIGHT -> (8,8): ILLEGAL (neck). Suicide. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u2716\n- DOWN -> (7,7): opens a route toward their body cluster and the apple at (8,7) next turn, but (7,6) is currently occupied by their body \u2014 potential choke later. Riskier gamble. \ud83c\udfaf vs \ud83d\udd25\n- LEFT -> (6,8): most flexible. Gives 3 escape directions next turn (up, down, left), keeps us centralized, avoids walls and immediate conflict. Best for baiting them into tight spaces. \u2705\n\nTactical decision: We CANNOT trade heads \u2014 they\u2019re ahead on apples. We want mobility and the ability to pivot to trap them later, not to gamble on grabbing a tempting apple that reduces our escape routes.

We need to control the board and force our rival into a trap!  \n\n**CURRENT STATE:**  \n- **My Head:** (9, 1) after moving DOWN last turn.  \n- **Board Analysis:**  \n  - **UP (9, 2):** Where my body is now. Moving UP would crash into myself. **DEAD.**  \n  - **RIGHT (Off Board):** Not an option. **DEAD.**  \n  - **DOWN (9, 0):** Empty. Safe, but it's the bottom-right corner. Moving there traps me with only one escape route (LEFT to 8,0).  \n  - **LEFT (8, 1):** Empty! This opens up the bottom row and keeps me mobile. From here, I can sweep LEFT toward (5,0) or UP to (8,2) for more apples.  \n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**  \n- Going DOWN to (9,0) feels like a corner-painting move, but I'm already winning. I don't need to squeeze myself into a dead end\u2014yet. Instead, I want to dominate the bottom edge while staying agile.  \n- Moving LEFT to (8,1) gives me flexibility: I can target the apple at (5,0) or pivot toward the center if the enemy makes a move.  \n- The enemy is still at (6,8), far away. They're not an immediate threat, but if they drop down, I need to be ready to block or outmaneuver.  \n- My long wall (from (9,2) to (7,6)) acts as a barrier. Moving LEFT keeps me on the edge of that structure, denying space to the enemy.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nTurn 10: Move LEFT to (8,1) to start sweeping the bottom row.  \nTurn 11: Continue LEFT to (7,1) or UP to (8,2), depending on apple spawns and enemy movement.  \nGoal: Clear the bottom-left apples ((5,0) is a prime target) while keeping the enemy boxed in the upper-left.

Wait, tail is at (8,6) after last move? Let's see: Body was [(9,1),(9,2),(9,3),(9,4),(9,5),(8,5),(8,6)] before last move. Last move LEFT from (9,1) to (8,1) means my tail (old last segment) moves forward along the body. New body: [(8,1),(9,1),(9,2),(9,3),(9,4),(9,5),(8,5)]? Wait, actually, the tail (8,6) should move forward, but in snake mechanics, when you move, the entire body shifts: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous one's spot, and the tail disappears. So after moving LEFT to (8,1), my new body should be: [(8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)]? Wait, let's recalc: Original body: head (8,1), then (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6). After moving LEFT from (8,1) to (8,1)? No, last turn I was at (9,1) and moved LEFT to (8,1). So new head is (8,1). Body shifts: (9,1) becomes first body segment, (9,2) becomes second, etc., and (8,6) is gone (tail moved). So current body: [(9,1),(9,2),(9,3),(9,4),(9,5),(8,5)]? Wait, the list given is HEAD-TO-TAIL: head (8,1), then body (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)? But the user message says \"Body: [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6)]\" \u2013 that's for head (8,1)? Actually, check the user message: \"Head: (8,1), Body: [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6)]\". That seems inconsistent because if head is at (8,1), the next segment should connect to it, but (9,1) is adjacent? (8,1) and (9,1) are adjacent (right/left), so yes, body starts at (9,1) which is to the right of head. So the body list includes all segments after head. So total segments = 1 head + 7 body = 8 segments (since 7 apples collected). So after last move, head moved to (8,1), and the tail (8,6) might still be there if no apple eaten? But I didn't eat an apple this turn, so tail should move forward. Actually, in standard Snake, when you move without eating, the tail disappears from its old spot. So the body list should update: new body = old body with tail removed, and head added? Wait, the given body list for next turn is fixed; I need to trust the current state as provided: Head (8,1), Body [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6)]. That's 7 body segments, so total length 8. That means after moving LEFT from (9,1) to (8,1), the tail (8,6) remains for now? Actually, in snake rules, when you move, the entire snake shifts: new head at new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and the tail moves to the position of the second-to-last segment. So if old body was [old head (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6)], after moving LEFT to (8,1), new head (8,1), new body: [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6)]? But (8,6) is still there? That would mean the tail didn't move, which only happens if you ate an apple. But I didn't eat last turn (apple at (9,1) was eaten on turn 10? Wait, last turn I was at (9,1) and ate the apple there? The user said \"we just ate that apple at (9,1)\" in last rationale. So on turn 10, I moved to (9,1) and ate an apple, so I grew. That means after turn 10, my tail did NOT move forward (since I grew). So the body list remains: head (8,1) after moving LEFT from (9,1)? No, let's clarify: On turn 10, my head was at (8,1) before moving? Wait, the last move was LEFT from (9,1) to (8,1) on turn 10? Actually, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale said \"Moving LEFT to (8,1)\". So on turn 10, I moved from (9,1) to (8,1). But was there an apple at (9,1)? Yes, and I ate it. So when I ate the apple, my snake grew. That means after moving to (8,1), my new body includes the old body plus an extra segment? Actually, in snake, when you eat, the tail stays where it is (doesn't move forward), so the snake gets longer. So the body list provided is after eating: head (8,1), body [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6)]. That means (8,6) is still the tail, and (9,1) is now the first body segment (the old head). So total length 8. Good.\n\nNow, for move options from (8,1):\n- **UP (8,2):** Check if (8,2) is occupied. From board state: Row 2 (y=2) is \". . . . . . . . A T\" for x=0..9, so (8,2) is 'A' (apple at (8,2)? Wait, apple list includes (8,2). Yes! So moving UP to (8,2) would eat an apple, growing to 8 apples. But is it safe? (8,2) is not occupied by my body or enemy. My body is at (9,1), (9,2), etc. (9,2) is a body segment, but (8,2) is adjacent and not part of my body. So safe. However, I need to consider the enemy's move. Enemy is at (5,8). If enemy moves DOWN, they might not reach me. But also, after eating, my snake grows, so tail stays at (8,6). That's good for score (8 vs 1). But moving UP might trap me? Let's see: After moving UP to (8,2), my new body: head (8,2), body [(8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6)]. That's a bit coiled, but still mobile. Possible next moves: from (8,2), I could go UP to (8,3) (apple at (8,3) listed), LEFT to (7,2), RIGHT to (9,2) (but (9,2) is my body, so death), DOWN to (8,1) (but (8,1) is my body now, so death unless I'm just arriving? Actually, moving back to immediate previous cell is hitting myself? The rules say: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" So from (8,2), moving DOWN to (8,1) would be moving into the body segment that was just my old head? But since I just left (8,1), and the body shifted, (8,1) is now part of my body. So yes, moving DOWN into (8,1) would crash into myself. So from (8,2), safe moves: UP, LEFT, possibly RIGHT? (9,2) is body, so no. So only UP and LEFT? UP to (8,3) (apple), LEFT to (7,2) (empty). That's two options. Not great, but acceptable.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,0):**\n   - Pro: Moves to bottom edge, near apple at (5,0) and (0,1). Might be easier to sweep bottom row.\n   - Con: (8,0) is empty (no apple there). Also, after moving DOWN, my body shifts: head (8,0), body [(8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6)]. From (8,0), possible next moves: UP to (8,1) (body, death), LEFT to (7,0) (empty), RIGHT to (9,0) (empty). So three options? UP is death, so LEFT and RIGHT are safe. Also DOWN is off-board? y=0 is bottom, so DOWN would be (8,-1) \u2013 death. So from (8,0), only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. That's two options. Not much mobility, but moving to bottom row might trap me less? Actually, from (8,0), I can go LEFT along the bottom to (5,0) or (0,0), but I'm limited to y=0. If I go LEFT to (7,0), then from there I can only go LEFT or RIGHT (UP to (7,1) might be safe if empty). (7,1) is empty currently. So more options there. However, (8,0) is a corner-ish spot\u2014only two safe directions. But I can plan to move along the bottom.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7,1):**\n   - Pro: Empty (no apple). Moves toward bottom-left apples like (5,0). Keeps me on the bottom edge but not in a corner. From (7,1), I can go DOWN to (7,0) (empty), LEFT to (6,1) (empty), or UP to (7,2) (empty). So three safe options. That's better mobility. Also, the apple at (5,0) is reachable in a few moves: LEFT, LEFT, DOWN.\n   - Con: No immediate apple. But I'm already winning 7-1, so I don't need to rush; I can play positioning.\n\n**COMPARING OPTIONS:**\n- **UP to (8,2):** Eats an apple (+1 point), grows to 8. But limits future moves to two directions (UP, LEFT) because RIGHT and DOWN are deadly. Could trap me if enemy pressures from above. Also, I'm moving toward the center where enemy might come down.\n- **DOWN to (8,0):** No apple, but gets me to bottom edge. Only two safe directions (LEFT, RIGHT) after move. Not great.\n- **LEFT to (7,1):** No apple, but highest mobility (three safe directions). Sets me up to sweep bottom row toward (5,0). Keeps me flexible.\n\n**ENEMY CONSIDERATION:**\n- Snake #1 has only 1 apple. They might move toward apples like (6,8) or (7,7)? Actually, (7,7) is empty. (6,8) is their body? Wait, body is [(6,8)], so (6,8) is body, head at (5,8). They could move LEFT to (4,8) or UP to (5,9) or DOWN to (5,7) or RIGHT to (6,8) (but that's their own body, so death). So they likely move DOWN or LEFT to find food. They're far from me, so no immediate head-on collision risk this turn. But if I go UP, I'm closer to them; if they come down, we might clash later. If I stay low, I can avoid them and let them crash into walls or their own body (they're on the edge).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI'm dominating the bottom edge. My current body forms a wall from (9,2) to (8,5) to (8,6) and (9,1) etc. Moving LEFT to (7,1) extends my reach toward the left side. Goal: \n- Turn 11: LEFT to (7,1). \n- Turn 12: LEFT to (6,1) or DOWN to (7,0) to target (5,0) apple. \n- Meanwhile, monitor enemy. If they move down, I might box them in by controlling the bottom. Force them to crash into my tail or a wall. I'm at 7 apples, so I need 23 more to win, but game ends if someone reaches 30. I can outgrow them slowly while trapping them. No need for risky head-on yet\u2014my score is high, so if we collide, I win only if I survive. Actually, if we head-on, both die, and I win because I have more apples. So if I can force a collision when I'm ahead, I win. But I should avoid it unless forced, because I want to survive to score more.\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP gives an apple but reduces mobility. DOWN gives no apple and low mobility. LEFT gives best mobility for future plays. Since I'm already winning, I'll prioritize positioning over immediate apple. Also, (8,2) apple might be taken by enemy later, but I can circle back. \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT\n\nCHALLENGE ACCEPTED! LEFT",

They might move DOWN or LEFT to find food.\n- **Body Collision Check from (7,1):**\n  - **UP (7,2):** EMPTY (board shows '.'). Safe.\n  - **DOWN (7,0):** EMPTY (board shows '.'). Safe.\n  - **LEFT (6,1):** EMPTY (board shows '.'). Safe.\n  - **RIGHT (8,1):** MY BODY (segment (8,1) is part of my body). **DEAD if I move RIGHT.**\n\n**ELIMINATING DEAD MOVES:**\n- RIGHT is death. Out.\n\n**REMAINING SAFE MOVES:** UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n1. **UP to (7,2):**\n   - Pro: Moves toward center. Apple at (7,4) is nearby. Could set up for middle control.\n   - Con: (7,2) is empty, but after moving UP, my body will shift. From (7,2), I can go UP to (7,3), LEFT to (6,2), or RIGHT to (8,2) (which has an apple!). DOWN would be back to (7,1) (body, death). So three options. \n   - Risk: Moving UP brings me closer to enemy territory (enemy at (4,8)). If enemy moves DOWN aggressively, we might converge later. Not ideal while I'm already ahead.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7,0):**\n   - Pro: Bottom row! This gets me closer to apple at (5,0). From (7,0), I can go LEFT to (6,0) or RIGHT to (8,0) (both empty). UP would be back to (7,1) (body, death). So only two safe directions. \n   - Con: Lower mobility, but it's a strategic retreat to dominate the bottom. The apple at (5,0) is reachable in two moves: LEFT to (6,0), then LEFT to (5,0). \n   - Long-term: Holding the bottom edge traps the enemy above if they push down. They only have 1 apple, so they're desperate for food and might make a mistake.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6,1):**\n   - Pro: Continued leftward movement, targeting (5,0) apple. From (6,1), I can go DOWN to (6,0) (empty), LEFT to (5,1) (empty), or UP to (6,2) (empty). DOWN to (6,0) then LEFT to (5,0) grabs the apple. So three safe options. \n   - Con: No immediate apple, but sets up for bottom-row sweep. \n   - Mobility: Excellent. Keeps options open.\n\n**ENEMY CONSIDERATION:**\nSnake #1 is at (4,8) with body at (5,8). They need food desperately (only 1 apple). They might move DOWN to (4,7) or LEFT to (3,8) to chase apples at (3,6) or (1,6). They're far from my bottom-left plan. If I stay low, I avoid head-on collisions and let them exhaust themselves against the upper edges.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**\nFocus on bottom-row domination. Move LEFT or DOWN to reach (5,0) apple. Use my body to form a barrier. If enemy heads down, I can maneuver to box them against my tail or the wall. Save apples for growth, but prioritize positioning. Force them to crash into me or the board when they panic.\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP gives good mobility but risks closing in on enemy. DOWN gives low mobility but secures bottom row. LEFT gives the best balance\u2014good mobility toward (5,0) and keeps me flexible. Since I'm winning, I'll prioritize safe expansion and apple access. LEFT is the play!\n\nCHALLENGE ACCEPTED! LEFT",

No, let's check: last turn my head was at (7,1), I moved LEFT, so new head is (6,1). But the board shows head at (6,1), body starts at (7,1) \u2013 yes, correct. However, the board state says head is (6,1) and body includes (7,1), (8,1), etc. So from (6,1), my body is to the RIGHT at (7,1), and behind me (to the LEFT) is (5,1) which should be empty.\n- **Enemy Head:** (4,7), body (4,8). They might move DOWN to (4,6) to chase apples, or UP to (4,8) but that's their own body? No, moving UP would be into (4,8) which is their body \u2013 that would be death for them. Or LEFT to (3,7), etc. We'll consider possibilities.\n- **Danger Check from Head (6,1):**\n  - **UP (6,2):** Empty (board shows '.'). Safe.\n  - **DOWN (6,0):** Empty (board shows '.'). Safe.\n  - **LEFT (5,1):** Empty (board shows '.'). Safe.\n  - **RIGHT (7,1):** MY BODY (segment (7,1)). **DEAD if move RIGHT.** So RIGHT is out.\n\n**REMAINING SAFE MOVES:** UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n1. **UP to (6,2):**\n   - Pro: Closer to mid-board, opens paths to apples like (5,0) indirectly via left then down, or (8,2) via right. From (6,2), I could go UP to (6,3) (has apple!), LEFT to (5,2), RIGHT to (7,2), DOWN back to (6,1) (body, death). So three good options.\n   - Con: Slightly moves me toward enemy territory (enemy at (4,7)), but they're far. Risk of convergence if they come down aggressively.\n   - Immediate: No apple at (6,2), but sets up for growth.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6,0):**\n   - Pro: Hits bottom row, closest to apple at (5,0) \u2013 just one LEFT move away after. From (6,0), I can go LEFT to (5,0) (apple!), RIGHT to (7,0) (empty), or UP back to (6,1) (body, death). So two safe moves, one leads to apple and growth.\n   - Con: Lower mobility (only two directions), but dominates bottom edge. Traps enemy above if they push down. I'm already ahead in apples (7 vs 1), so securing easy food while controlling perimeter is smart.\n   - Long-term: Holding bottom makes it hard for enemy to invade without crashing into my tail or the wall. They're desperate for food, so they might make risky moves.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5,1):**\n   - Pro: Closer to apple at (5,0) (just DOWN next turn). From (5,1), I can go DOWN to (5,0) (apple!), LEFT to (4,1) (empty), UP to (5,2) (empty), or RIGHT back to (6,1) (body, death). So three options, including immediate apple access.\n   - Con: Slightly moves me left, away from center, but that's fine since bottom is focus.\n   - Mobility: Excellent, keeps multiple paths open.\n\n**ENEMY CONSIDERATION:**\nSnake #1 at (4,7) with body (4,8) and only 1 apple. They're likely chasing nearby apples like (3,6) or (1,6). If they move DOWN to (4,6), they might be heading toward me, but they're slow. By staying low and claiming bottom, I force them to stay high or risk coming down into my growing body. No head-on collision threat this turn since we're far apart.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDominate bottom row. After DOWN to (6,0), next turn LEFT to (5,0) for apple. Then sweep left along bottom (toward (0,1) or (0,6) apples) or up to block enemy if they come down. Use my length (8 segments) to form a barrier. Grow to solidify lead and punish any enemy aggression. If they crash into me, instant win. Keep mobile to avoid traps.\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP gives good options but moves toward potential enemy paths. LEFT is great but DOWN gives the quickest apple (5,0) while anchoring the bottom. Since I'm winning, let's secure the edge and control the board. DOWN for the easy growth and strategic positioning!\n\nCHALLENGE ACCEPTED! \ud83d\udc0d DOWN",

We should prioritize growth and central lane control so we can later hem them in from above/left when they\u2019re pressured against the wall.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Grab the apple at (4,6) now to increase apples and length. More length = more zoning power.  \n- After eating, rotate to control the central columns (x=2..6), aim to cut off the right side once we have a leash of body segments.  \n- Avoid head-on confrontations until our apple count is competitive. Force them to commit to the right wall and then seal exits while keeping our tail safe.\n\nLocking it in \u2014 we take the apple and grow.

If I move, the tail will move forward (shedding the last segment), so (9,4) will become empty after my move.\n- **Enemy Head:** (4,6), body: [(4,7), (4,8)], apples: 2. They moved DOWN from (4,7) to (4,6). That's aggressive \u2013 they're coming down toward me! Their body is at (4,7) and (4,8), so moving DOWN into (4,6) was safe for them. Now they're only 2 cells away from my body vertically (from (4,6) to (6,0) is not direct, but they could chase). They're still far, but closing in.\n- **Danger Check from Head (6,0):**\n  - **UP (6,1):** MY BODY (segment (6,1)). **DEAD if move UP.** That's moving backwards into my own body. OUT.\n  - **DOWN (6,-1):** Off the board! DEAD. OUT.\n  - **LEFT (5,0):** EMPTY (board shows '.'). Safe. Also, there's an apple at (5,0) \u2013 eating it would grow me to 8 apples! But remember: we move simultaneously, and apples are collected if the head lands on them after the move. So if I move LEFT to (5,0), I'll eat the apple and GROW. BUT: enemy could also move into (5,0) if they choose LEFT from (4,6)? They'd be at (4,6) moving LEFT to (3,6) \u2013 that's an apple spot (3,6) but not (5,0). So no conflict. \n  - **RIGHT (7,0):** EMPTY (board shows '.'). Safe. No immediate apple, but opens paths.\n\n**REMAINING SAFE MOVES:** LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n1. **LEFT to (5,0):**\n   - Pro: EATS THE APPLE AT (5,0)! +1 point, growth to 8 apples. I'm already ahead (7 vs 2), so extending the lead is key. From (5,0), I can go LEFT to (4,0) (empty), UP to (5,1) (empty \u2013 note (5,1) is empty now since my body is at (6,1) and beyond), or RIGHT back to (6,0) (body, death). So two safe moves after, plus the apple growth.\n   - Pro: Anchors bottom left, dominates the bottom row. Keeps me low, forcing enemy to come down into my territory if they want to fight. Enemy is at (4,6), so they might move DOWN to (4,5) or LEFT to (3,6) (apple there). If they go DOWN, they're getting closer but still far.\n   - Con: Slightly reduces right-side mobility, but that's fine \u2013 I have the whole bottom to sweep.\n   - Immediate Win: GROW and extend lead. Aggressive play \u2013 I'm hunting apples while keeping body intact.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (7,0):**\n   - Pro: Opens rightward path. From (7,0), I can go RIGHT to (8,0) (empty), LEFT back to (6,0) (body, death), or UP to (7,1) (body, death). Wait, UP to (7,1) is MY BODY \u2013 that's also death. So only one safe move: RIGHT to (8,0). That's a trap! Dead end after one move.\n   - Con: If I go RIGHT, I might get stuck at the right wall with limited options. No apple immediately, and I'd be forced to keep moving right until I hit the wall, then die. Also, enemy at (4,6) could potentially cut me off if they move aggressively, but more importantly, I lose the easy apple at (5,0).\n   - Risk: Low mobility \u2013 only one direction (RIGHT) to avoid death. That's getting boxed in, which is exactly what the rules warn against.\n\n**ENEMY CONSIDERATION:**\nSnake #1 is at (4,6) after moving DOWN. They're hungry for apples (only 2). Likely targets: (3,6) (apple directly left), (5,6) (empty but might chase), or even DOWN to (4,5) to get closer to me. If they go LEFT to (3,6), they'll grow to 3 apples \u2013 still far behind me. If they go DOWN to (4,5), they're approaching my space. But by going LEFT to (5,0), I'm securing growth while staying out of immediate collision range. If they come down, my growing body can form a barrier. No head-on threat this turn: they'd have to move RIGHT to (5,6) or DOWN to (4,5) to get close, but not directly into my path.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (5,0) to grow to 8 apples and extend my lead. From (5,0), I'll sweep left along the bottom row next turn (e.g., LEFT to (4,0), then (3,0), etc.) to claim more apples like (0,1) or (0,6) eventually. Meanwhile, monitor enemy: if they push down into the bottom half, I can use my length to trap them against the wall or my body. Goal: force them to crash into me or the board edges. Stay aggressive \u2013 I'm winning, so don't give them breathing room. If they try to head-on later, I have the size advantage (8 segments vs their 3). Growth is domination!\n\n**DECISION:**\nRIGHT is a trap with only one safe path and no immediate gain. LEFT lets me eat the apple, grow, and keep multiple options open while controlling the bottom. Easy choice \u2013 I'm grabbing that apple and strengthening my position! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nCHALLENGE ACCEPTED! LEFT",

ATE THE APPLE AT (5, 0)! \ud83c\udf89 I'm now at 8 apples, leading 8 vs 3. Growth confirmed \u2013 my body should now include (5,0) as the new head, shifting the previous head (6,0) to the new neck. Wait, let's clarify: before the move, my head was at (6,0) and body was [(6,1), (7,1), ...]. After moving LEFT to (5,0) and eating the apple, I grow \u2013 so the new body list becomes: [(6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)]. (5,0) is the new head, and I have an extra segment at (6,0) (the old head). Perfect \u2013 I'm longer and dominating.\n- **Enemy Head:** (3, 6) after moving LEFT last turn? (From (4,6) to (3,6)). (3,6) was an apple drop \u2013 they ate it, growing to 3 apples. Their body is now [(4,6), (4,7), (4,8)]. They're still at y=6, far from me at y=0, but getting closer to bottom. No immediate collision threat this turn.\n- **My Current Head (5,0):**\n  - **UP (5,1):** EMPTY (board shows '.' there; my body starts at (6,0) and beyond). SAFE.\n  - **DOWN (5,-1):** Off the board! DEAD. OUT.\n  - **LEFT (4,0):** EMPTY (board '.'). SAFE. Apple at (3,0) one step away.\n  - **RIGHT (6,0):** MY BODY \u2013 the segment (6,0) is now part of my body (old head). Moving into your own body = DEAD. OUT.\n  - **SAFETY:** LEFT and UP are safe. RIGHT is self-collision. DOWN is off-board. Only two options, but UP keeps me more central.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n1. **LEFT to (4,0):**\n   - Pro: Moves me toward the apple at (3,0) \u2013 could eat it next turn if I keep left. From (4,0), I can go LEFT to (3,0) (empty, but there's an apple), UP to (4,1) (empty), or RIGHT back to (5,0) (body \u2013 but wait, (5,0) will be my body after this move? Yes, since I'll shed the tail). So from (4,0), I'll have LEFT, UP, and possibly DOWN (off-board) but DOWN is death. Actually, from (4,0), RIGHT to (5,0) would be my body (old head), so that's death. So safe moves from (4,0): LEFT (to apple), UP (to empty), and maybe continue left. Good mobility.\n   - Pro: Confirms control of bottom row. From here, I can sweep left to (3,0), (2,0), etc., claiming (3,0) apple and eventually (0,1) or (0,6) apples. Keeps me low, forcing enemy to chase down into my territory.\n   - Con: Enemy is at (3,6) \u2013 if they move DOWN to (3,5) (empty), they're getting closer to me but still distant. No direct threat.\n   - Aggression: Secures another apple quickly, extending my lead to 9. I'm already winning \u2013 why risk center?\n\n2. **UP to (5,1):**\n   - Pro: Moves me off the bottom row, potentially safer if enemy rushes down. From (5,1), I can go UP to (5,2) (empty), DOWN back to (5,0) (body \u2013 death), LEFT to (4,1) (empty), or RIGHT to (6,1) (body \u2013 death). So only UP and LEFT are safe. That's two directions, but LEFT is better to avoid getting pinned at top if enemy walls me in.\n   - Con: Moves me away from the (3,0) apple, which I could have reached in two turns by going left. Also, I'm entering the middle where enemy is active \u2013 they might move DOWN to (3,5) or even (2,5) and start cutting off my paths. If they get aggressive, I could get trapped between their body and walls. No apple immediately \u2013 no growth.\n   - Risk: Reduces my bottom dominance. If I go UP, I might have to loop around later to get the low apples, wasting turns.\n\n**ENEMY CONSIDERATION:**\nSnake #1 at (3,6) ate an apple, growing to 3. They're likely targeting the cluster at (1,6), (0,6), (1,7) or coming down toward me. If they move DOWN to (3,5) (empty), they're approaching the center. If they go LEFT to (2,6) (empty but near apples), they might go for (1,6). By going LEFT to (4,0), I'm staying out of their way while claiming territory. If they ever chase me down, my length (now 9 segments?) will be a wall they can't penetrate without dying. No head-on collision this turn \u2013 they're too far to reach (5,0) or (4,0) in one move.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the bottom-left corner to starve the enemy of space. From (4,0), next turn go LEFT to (3,0) (eat apple), then LEFT to (2,0), LEFT to (1,0) (empty, but (0,1) apple nearby via UP), eventually claiming (0,1) and (0,6). Build a wall along the left and bottom. Monitor enemy: if they push south, use my body to box them in against the wall or force a head-on where I win (8 > 3 apples). Stay hungry \u2013 growth is power!\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP keeps me central but abandons the easy apple at (3,0). LEFT grabs territory, progresses toward more apples, and maintains my bottom control \u2013 exactly what I need to dominate and force the enemy into a crash. I'm aggressive and winning; let's keep the pressure on! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nCHALLENGE ACCEPTED! LEFT",

Opponent is down on the bottom-right \u2014 not an immediate head-on threat. We need growth and space control.\n\nEvaluate all 4 moves:\n- UP -> (3,7): Legal. Empty.

Safe though. \ud83e\udd14\n- DOWN -> (3,5): Legal AND there\u2019s an apple at (3,5). Eat now, GROW, +1 apple. That immediately improves our score and increases zoning power. \ud83c\udf4e\u26a1\n- LEFT -> (2,6): Legal. No apple immediately but directly heads toward the apple chain at (1,6) and (0,6).

All candidate moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are safe from instant death.\n\nDecision and reasoning: We WANT to grow now to close the gap (3 -> 4 apples) and increase our board control. Eating (3,5) does that immediately and keeps multiple escape/continuation options afterward (we can swing left into the 1,6/0,6 chain or peel around up/left). Aggressive, but smart \u2014 get content and length first, then box later when we\u2019re beefed up. LET\u2019S EAT.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Eat (3,5) this turn to go to 4 apples.\n- Then pivot left toward (1,6) and (0,6) apples to keep chaining and expand left-side territory.\n- Once longer, start hemming the opponent from above/left if they drift toward the bottom-right; avoid head-on trades until we\u2019re closer in apples.\n\nDOWN",

My body starts at (5, 0) and beyond. SAFE.\n  - **DOWN (4, -1):** Off the board! DEAD. OUT.\n  - **LEFT (3, 0):** EMPTY (board '.'). SAFE.

So LEFT and UP are safe, maintaining mobility. I can sweep left to (2, 0), (1, 0), then UP to (0, 1) for the next apple. Perfect for dominating the bottom-left.\n   - Pro: Stays low, forcing the enemy to chase down into my territory. If they try to rush south, my growing body will be a wall they can't pass without dying.\n   - Con: None \u2013 this is pure aggression.

From (4, 1), I can go UP to (4, 2), LEFT to (3, 1), DOWN back to (4, 0) (body \u2013 death). So UP and LEFT are safe.\n   - Con: Doesn't eat an apple immediately. I miss out on the guaranteed growth at (3, 0). Enemy is at (3, 5) \u2013 if they move DOWN to (3, 4) or LEFT to (2, 5), they're still not an immediate threat, but by going UP, I'm entering the middle where they could cut off my paths later.\n   - Risk: Less aggressive \u2013 I'm giving up easy growth and potentially letting the enemy close the gap. Why risk it when I can eat and extend my lead?\n\n**ENEMY CONSIDERATION:**\nSnake #1 is at (3, 5) with 4 apples. They're likely targeting the apple cluster at (1, 6), (0, 6), (1, 7) or pushing down toward me. If they move DOWN to (3, 4) (empty), they're closer but still far.

Now at (3, 0), body follows: [(4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)]. Score: 9 apples.\n- **Enemy Head:** (4, 5) \u2013 they moved UP from (3, 5) to (4, 5) (board shows '1' at (4, 5)). They have 5 apples now (scoreboard says 5 apples \u2013 maybe they ate an apple I missed? Board at (4, 5) was empty before, but they grew? Wait, scoreboard shows 5 apples, up from 4, so they must have eaten an apple last turn. They're at (4, 5), body: [(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)]. Still not an immediate threat \u2013 5 vs 9, and they're 5 squares away in y (0 vs 5).\n- **Current Head (3, 0):**\n  - **UP (3, 1):** EMPTY (board '.'). Safe. My body starts at (4, 0) and beyond \u2013 (3, 1) is clear.\n  - **DOWN (3, -1):** Off the board! DEAD. OUT.\n  - **LEFT (2, 0):** EMPTY (board '.'). Safe. Apple at (2, 0)? No, apple at (1, 0) is further left, (0, 1) is up-left. But (2, 0) is empty.\n  - **RIGHT (4, 0):** MY BODY \u2013 the segment (4, 0) is now part of my body (old head). Moving into your own body = DEAD. OUT.\n  - **SAFETY:** LEFT and UP are safe. DOWN death, RIGHT death. Two options.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n1. **LEFT to (2, 0):**\n   - Pro: Moves me closer to the left edge and potential apples. From (2, 0), I can go LEFT to (1, 0), UP to (2, 1), or RIGHT back to (3, 0) (body \u2013 death). So LEFT and UP are safe. This keeps me on the bottom row, expanding my territory leftward.\n   - Pro: I'm controlling the bottom row, forcing the enemy to come down into my domain. They're at (4, 5) \u2013 if they move DOWN to (4, 4) or (3, 4), they're still far. My body (from (3,0) to (9,3)) acts as a wall along the bottom-right.\n   - Pro: Safe, maintains aggression without overextending into the middle. I can eat the apple at (1, 0) next if I go LEFT again.\n   - Con: Doesn't eat an apple immediately, but that's fine \u2013 I'm already ahead. Better to position for the next apple.\n\n2. **UP to (3, 1):**\n   - Pro: Moves me into the middle-lower area. From (3, 1), I can go UP to (3, 2), LEFT to (2, 1), DOWN back to (3, 0) (body \u2013 death). So UP and LEFT are safe. This opens paths toward apples at (6, 3), (7, 4), etc.\n   - Con: Entering the central zone where the enemy might move. If they go LEFT to (3, 5) or DOWN to (4, 4), they're closer to the center. Riskier for potential head-on later, but no immediate danger.\n   - Risk: Less focused on dominating the bottom-left. I'm winning; I should prioritize controlling low-y areas to trap the enemy against the edge.\n\n**ENEMY CONSIDERATION:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 5) with 5 apples. They're likely targeting the apple cluster at (6, 3), (7, 4), or (8, 2), (8, 3). If they move DOWN to (4, 4) or LEFT to (3, 5), they're pushing toward the bottom but still far from me. By going LEFT to (2, 0), I'm securing the left side and growing my body wall. If they ever try to head-on south, I have 9 apples vs 5 \u2013 I win the collision. No head-on risk this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nClaim the entire bottom row and left column! Next turns: LEFT to (2, 0), LEFT to (1, 0), UP to (0, 1) (eat apple), then snake up the left wall to (0, 6) and (1, 7). Use my body to create a fence along x=0 and y=0. Monitor enemy: if they push south, I'll wall them off against the bottom edge. Stay hungry and aggressive \u2013 30 apples or bust! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT is the move \u2013 it keeps me on the aggressive path, expands my territory, and avoids overextending into the middle where the enemy might lurk. UP is riskier with less immediate payoff. Time to box him in from the left! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

Neck: (3,5) \u2192 LEFT is a backward move (illegal).\n- Our body occupies (3,5),(3,6),(4,6),(4,7),(4,8) \u2192 UP -> (4,6) would crash into our own body (insta-death).

They\u2019re far away this turn \u2014 no immediate head-on danger. They\u2019ll likely move UP/LEFT to escape their own body constraints, not into us.\n\nMove comparison (short and spicy)\n- DOWN (4,4): Safe, keeps options open (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN next turn), moves toward the center. Good mobility.\n- RIGHT (5,5): Safe, more aggressive \u2014 moves us toward the nearby apple cluster (5,3) / (6,3) and closer to the apple at (7,5). From (5,5) we\u2019ll have 3 escape follow-ups (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) next turn, so we won\u2019t be boxed immediately.\n\nDecision (be aggressive \u2014 we\u2019re behind on apples)\n- Take RIGHT. It pushes us toward the clustered apples near the opponent so we can start chaining growth and then look to hem them in. No immediate head-on risk; lots of follow-up options from (5,5).\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns)\n- RIGHT now to (5,5).\n- Then go DOWN \u2192 (5,4) and DOWN \u2192 (5,3) to eat that apple chain (5,3) then (6,3).\n- Grow quickly to create the length needed to force a head-on later if they try to escape into us.

Score: 9 apples.\n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 5) \u2013 they moved DOWN from (4, 5) to (5, 5) (board shows '1' at (5, 5)). They have 5 apples. They're at (5, 5), body: [(4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)]. Still far away (y-difference 5), but they're now closer to the apple cluster at (6, 3), (7, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3). If they push DOWN further, they might head toward my domain, but not yet an immediate threat.\n\n- **Current Head (2, 0):**\n  - **UP (2, 1):** EMPTY (board '.'). Safe.

No, apple at (0, 1) is up-left, (1, 6) is far. But (1, 0) is empty and connects to my body safely.\n  - **RIGHT (3, 0):** MY BODY \u2013 the segment (3, 0) is now part of my body (old head). Moving into your own body = DEAD. OUT.\n  - **SAFETY:** LEFT and UP are safe. DOWN death, RIGHT death. Two options.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n1. **LEFT to (1, 0):**\n   - Pro: Moves me further left, closer to the apple at (0, 1). From (1, 0), I can go LEFT to (0, 0) (safe), UP to (1, 1), or RIGHT back to (2, 0) (body \u2013 death). So LEFT and UP are safe. This continues my aggressive expansion along the bottom-left edge, boxing the enemy against the right wall.\n   - Pro: Dominates the bottom row, creating a body wall that the enemy cannot cross without crashing. I'm already at 9 apples vs their 5 \u2013 if they ever try a head-on collision south, I win easily. I can eat the apple at (0, 1) next if I go UP after LEFT.\n   - Pro: Keeps multiple options open; from (1, 0), I can snake up the left wall to (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6) apples, and then pivot to the top-left. This plan aligns with trapping the enemy in the right half.\n   - Con: Doesn't eat an apple immediately, but that's fine \u2013 positioning is king when leading.\n\n2. **UP to (2, 1):**\n   - Pro: Moves me into the central zone, closer to apples at (6, 3), (7, 4), etc. From (2, 1), I can go UP to (2, 2), LEFT to (1, 1), or DOWN back to (2, 0) (body \u2013 death). So UP and LEFT are safe.\n   - Con: Entering the middle where the enemy is at (5, 5) \u2013 if they go LEFT to (4, 5) or DOWN to (5, 4), they're pushing into my path. Riskier for potential head-on, and I lose focus on the bottom-left control I've built. Less aggressive against the enemy's position.\n\n**ENEMY CONSIDERATION:**\nSnake #1 at (5, 5) is likely chasing the apple cluster south (6, 3), (7, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3). They might move DOWN to (5, 4) or LEFT to (4, 5). By going LEFT to (1, 0), I'm securing the left side and building my body wall. If they ever try to head-on north or west, I have the score advantage (9>5) \u2013 head-on wins for me. No collision risk this turn; they're too far.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nClaim the entire bottom row and left column! Next turns: LEFT to (1, 0), UP to (0, 1) (eat apple), then UP to (0, 2), UP to (0, 3), RIGHT to (1, 3)? No, snake up the left wall to (0, 4), (0, 6), and (1, 7) apples.

Body now: [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1)]. Wait, hold up \u2013 the board shows 'T' at (2, 0), meaning my tail is there now? Actually, my body list shows (2, 0) as the first body segment after the head (1, 0). I'm at (1, 0), body starts at (2, 0) to (9, 1). All good, no self-collision.\n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 4) \u2013 From the board, they moved DOWN from (5, 5) to (5, 4). Body: [(5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6)]. They're now at y=4, x=5. Still not immediate danger, but they're creeping closer to the apple cluster at (6, 3), (7, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3). If they go DOWN again to (5, 3), they might head toward my planned path, but distance is still decent.\n- **Current Head (1, 0):**\n  - **UP (1, 1):** EMPTY (board '.'). Safe. My body starts at (2, 0) \u2013 (1, 1) is clear. No apple, but opens up to the left wall.\n  - **DOWN (1, -1):** Off the board! DEAD. OUT.\n  - **LEFT (0, 0):** EMPTY (board '.'). Safe. Apple at (0, 1) is just above \u2013 I can eat it next if I go UP after this.\n  - **RIGHT (2, 0):** MY BODY \u2013 segment (2, 0) is part of my body. Moving into it = DEAD. OUT.\n  - **SAFETY:** UP and LEFT are safe. DOWN death, RIGHT death. Two options again.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n1. **LEFT to (0, 0):**\n   - Pro: Secures the absolute bottom-left corner! I own the corner, which is a fortress. From (0, 0), I can only go UP to (0, 1) (apple \u2013 GROW!), or RIGHT back to (1, 0) (body \u2013 death, avoid). So UP is the natural next move to grab the apple at (0, 1).\n   - Pro: My body already snakes along the bottom row from (2, 0) to (9, 1). Adding (0, 0) and (0, 1) creates an impenetrable wall on the left edge. The enemy at (5, 4) will be trapped on the right \u2013 if they try to go west, they hit my body or the edge. I'm at 9 apples vs their 5; head-on collision favors me massively.\n   - Pro: This is aggressive territory control. I'll snake up the left wall to collect apples at (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), dominating the left side. Meanwhile, the enemy is stuck chasing apples on the right like (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 7), (8, 9) \u2013 isolated corners.\n   - Con: From (0, 0), I'm slightly more boxed in long-term (only one exit up), but with 9 apples, I can afford to be bold. If the enemy surprises me from the north, I can still retreat along my body wall.\n\n2. **UP to (1, 1):**\n   - Pro: Moves me into the open space, closer to the apple at (1, 6) and the central apples. From (1, 1), I can go UP to (1, 2), LEFT to (0, 1) (apple), or DOWN back to (1, 0) (body \u2013 death). So UP and LEFT are safe.\n   - Pro: More flexibility \u2013 I can chase the apple at (1, 6) quickly or pivot to the left wall later. Keeps options open for reaching the top-left apples (6, 9), (7, 9? No, (6, 9) is there).\n   - Con: Less aggressive for boxing the enemy. I'm not fully claiming the corner yet, and the enemy might cut me off from the left wall if they move smart. They're at (5, 4); if they go LEFT to (4, 4), they're getting closer to my potential path. UP feels passive when I need to be ruthless with my lead.\n\n**ENEMY CONSIDERATION:**\nSnake #1 at (5, 4) is probably eyeing the apple at (6, 3) or (5, 3) \u2013 they might move DOWN to (5, 3) or RIGHT to (6, 4). By going LEFT to (0, 0), I'm not engaging them directly but building a fortress that will force them into a dead end on the right. If they push south aggressively, my body wall at the bottom will trap them against y=0. Head-on? I win with 9>5 \u2013 let them try! No collision risk this turn; we're far apart.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nClaim the corner and snake up the left wall! Next turns: LEFT to (0, 0), UP to (0, 1) (eat apple, grow to 10!), then UP to (0, 2), UP to (0, 3), UP to (0, 4) (apple), UP to (0, 5), UP to (0, 6) (apple), then maybe RIGHT to (1, 6) or UP to (0, 7)? The apple at (1, 7) is also reachable. Use my body to form a solid fence from (0,0) to (9,1), making the right half a death trap for the enemy. Monitor their moves: if they go DOWN or LEFT aggressively, I'll wall them off. Stay ahead on apples \u2013 30 or bust! They're at 5; I'm at 9. Domination mode: ON. \ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT to (0, 0) \u2013 it locks in my territory advantage, sets up an immediate apple grab next turn, and keeps the enemy contained. UP is safer short-term but less commanding for the endgame. Time to own the corner and watch him panic! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

They\u2019re ahead on apples (9 vs 5), so we need to get length FAST to start boxing.\n- DOWN gets us an apple now and sets up the immediate follow-up RIGHT to (6,3) for another apple. That both closes the apple gap and gives us more room to pressure later.\n- LEFT/RIGHT keep options open, but they\u2019re slower for catching up. No head-on risk this turn anyway.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- This turn: take the apple at (5,3) (DOWN).\n- Next turn: RIGHT to (6,3) and grab that apple.\n- After that: use extra length to cut lanes, force the enemy into tighter spaces, and only go for a head-on if we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\nLet\u2019s eat and start the box \u2014 GO TIME.  \n\nDOWN",

Don\u2019t bite the neck. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,3) is safe but drifts away from immediate apples and pushes us toward our own body/cluster \u2014 tighter options next turns. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,2) is safe but no apple; slower apple gain, gives opponent more time to stay ahead. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,3) is safe AND has an apple. Opponent at (0,0) is nowhere near for a head-on. This eats now, grows us, and gives multiple follow-ups (UP to 6,4, DOWN to 6,2, RIGHT to 7,3). \u2705\n\nRationale:\n- We\u2019re down on apples (9 vs 6). We MUST close the gap fast. Eating (6,3) now reduces that deficit and gives us extra length to start cutting lanes.\n- No simultaneous head-on risk this turn \u2014 enemy can\u2019t reach (6,3).\n- Growth will make our tail not move this turn, but we still retain multiple escape options from (6,3). This keeps future moves open and lets us be aggressive next turns.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Grab (6,3) now (RIGHT). Then pressure toward the cluster at x=7,y=4/5 to control the middle-right quadrant and start boxing lanes. Grow fast, then try to corral opponents toward edges for a head-on if we're leading apples.\n\nLet\u2019s eat and start the box \u2014 GO TIME.  \n\nRIGHT",

My body now: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, (0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1)]. Tail at (8, 1). From (0, 1), let's check my options:\n  - **UP (0, 2):** Empty. SAFE. My body starts at (0, 0) \u2013 no collision.\n  - **DOWN (0, 0):** My own tail? No, (0, 0) is my second segment, but the tail is (8, 1). Wait, body list: head is (0,1), then (0,0), (1,0)... so moving DOWN to (0,0) would be moving into my own body (the second segment). That's immediate death \u2013 I'd hit myself. DEAD.\n  - **LEFT (-1, 1):** Off board! DEAD.\n  - **RIGHT (1, 1):** Empty. SAFE. My body is at (0,0) and (1,0) \u2013 (1,1) is clear.\n  - **SAFETY:** Only UP and RIGHT are safe. No forced move this turn \u2013 good, I have a choice!\n- **Enemy Head:** (6, 3) \u2013 They moved LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3) last turn? Wait, the board shows snake #1 head at (6,3) in the current state? Let me double-check: The board state shows \"1\" at (6,3) with body trailing. Actually, looking at the board grid: At (6,3) there's a \"1\", and it's listed as head in the opponent section. Their body is [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]. So head is (6,3), body includes (5,3). From (6,3), they could go UP (6,4), DOWN (6,2), LEFT (5,3) (into their own body \u2013 death), or RIGHT (7,3) (apple \u2013 might eat). They're at x=6,y=3, I'm at (0,1). Still far, but they're in the lower middle-right. Distance: 6 cells away horizontally. Not an immediate head-on threat.\n- **Apple Position:** (0,4) is an apple directly above me \u2013 reachable in 3 turns if I go UP. (0,6) is also an apple. (1,4), (1,6), (1,7) are nearby. My current body forms a wall from (0,0) to (8,1), blocking the bottom. The enemy is to the right.\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n- **UP to (0, 2):** Moves me toward (0,4) apple \u2013 good position for growth. From (0,2), I'll have options: UP to (0,3) (empty), DOWN back to (0,1) (safe but no apple), RIGHT to (1,2) (empty). No immediate dead end. This extends my vertical control on the left wall, boxing the enemy into the right half. They might chase (8,2), (8,3), etc., but my body is a barrier.\n- **RIGHT to (1, 1):** Also safe, and moves me toward (1,4), (1,6) apples. From (1,1), options: UP (1,2), DOWN (1,0) (empty \u2013 safe), LEFT (0,1) (my own tail? Wait, tail is (8,1), so (0,1) is body \u2013 moving LEFT would hit my body? No, head at (1,1), LEFT to (0,1) which is body segment (second from head). That's death! So from (1,1), LEFT is a trap. RIGHT to (2,1) also safe. But RIGHT puts me closer to enemy territory \u2013 they're at x=6, so still safe, but I'm moving right when I could dominate left. Plus, my current wall from x=0 to x=8 at y=0-1 is strong; moving RIGHT might weaken that block if the enemy tries to slip under.\n- **Head-On Collision Risk:** My score 10 vs their 7 \u2013 if we clash, I win! But forcing it now is risky; they might not move into me. Better to grow and corner them. Avoid moving into their predicted path \u2013 they might go for (7,3) apple or up/down. If I go UP, I'm farther from them. If I go RIGHT, I'm closer but still not colliding.\n- **Long-Term Plan:** Keep snaking up the left wall: UP to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) (eat apple), (0,5), (0,6) (another apple!). Then curve right along the top (y=9) to grab (4,9), (5,9), etc., while my tail blocks the bottom. Enemy is trapped on the right; force them into a dead end. If they try to head-on, I crush them with 10>7. Stay aggressive, eat everything, no mercy!\n\n**DECISION:** UP \u2013 grows my position toward the next apple, maintains left dominance, and keeps multiple future paths open. RIGHT is tempting but riskier for trapping myself later. Chat, this is the setup for the knockout! Let's box him in! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s get this W live! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nQuick 4-way check (thinking loud for the fans \u2014 we\u2019re ruthless but smart):\n\n- UP \u2192 to (6,4): legal and safe. Keeps space open, but doesn\u2019t close the apple gap fast. Good fallback if we need room. \ud83e\udd14\n- DOWN \u2192 to (6,2): legal and safe. Slower apple tempo, drifts away from the right-side cluster we can control. Meh for aggression. \ud83d\udc22\n- LEFT \u2192 to (5,3): ILLEGAL \u2014 that\u2019s the neck (backwards). Don\u2019t self-delete. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 to (7,3): legal, safe, AND there\u2019s an apple. Immediate growth, shortens the apple deficit and lets us start cutting mid-right lanes. Aggressive and smart given opponent is stuck on the far left bottom. \ud83d\udfe9\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nOpponent check: their head is at (0,1). They can\u2019t threaten us this turn (they\u2019ll move right/up along the bottom), and they lead apples (10 vs our 7) \u2014 so we absolutely avoid forcing a mutual head-on. We want them to crash into our body, not trade heads. Got it? Good. \ud83d\ude08\n\nDecision rationale: We need apples and board control. RIGHT gives immediate growth, opens up chaining to (8,3) or (7,4) next turn, and starts boxing the middle-right quadrant while the rival crawls along the left edge. It preserves multiple follow-ups (UP or DOWN after the eat, or another RIGHT onto the apple cluster), while not risking a head-to-head with a higher-scoring foe.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Eat (7,3) now (grow).\n- Immediately threaten the cluster (8,3) and (7,4) to chain apples and extend length.\n- Use increased length to control the x=7\u20138 corridor, pushing the opponent\u2019s movement options left/down so we can attempt to corral him into his own body or the wall \u2014 but never force a simultaneous-head collision (he\u2019s ahead on apples).\n- Always keep an escape: if the left side of the board starts to close, peel back and hug open space; priority = stay alive.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT AND START THE CORRAL \u2014 CONTENT & CONTROL.  \n\nRIGHT",

My body: [(0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1)], tail at (7, 1). From (0, 2):  \n  - **UP (0, 3):** Empty. SAFE. My body starts at (0, 1) \u2013 no collision.  \n  - **DOWN (0, 1):** My own body segment \u2013 immediate death! \u274c  \n  - **LEFT (-1, 2):** Off board \u2013 dead! \u274c  \n  - **RIGHT (1, 2):** Empty. SAFE.  \n  **SAFETY:** Only UP and RIGHT are viable. No forced move, but I must choose wisely.  \n\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 3) \u2013 They're still at (7, 3) per the board state. Their body trails down to (4, 6). From (7, 3), they could go UP (7, 4) (apple!), DOWN (7, 2) (empty), LEFT (6, 3) (their own body? Wait, their body includes (6, 3)? Actually, their body list: [(6, 3), (5, 3), ...]. So LEFT (6, 3) is their own tail \u2013 death! RIGHT (8, 3) (apple!). They're likely to eat (8, 3) or (7, 4). Distance to me: Still ~7 cells away \u2013 no immediate head-on threat.  \n\n- **Apple Position:** (0, 4) is directly above me \u2013 eatable in 2 moves if I go UP UP. (0, 6) is further up. (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7) are nearby to the right. The board is cluttered with apples, but I'm ignoring them for now; my focus is boxing the enemy.  \n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**  \n- **UP to (0, 3):** Moves me directly toward (0, 4) apple \u2013 growth opportunity. From (0, 3), I'll have options: UP to (0, 4) (apple \u2013 eat and grow), DOWN to (0, 2) (safe), RIGHT to (1, 3) (empty). This extends my vertical wall on the left, further trapping the enemy in the right half. My body already blocks the bottom; climbing up keeps me in control. Perfect for aggressive domination.  \n- **RIGHT to (1, 2):** Also safe, and moves me toward (1, 4) apple. From (1, 2), options: UP (1, 3), DOWN (1, 1) (empty? Wait, my body is at (0,1) and (0,0), so (1,1) is empty \u2013 safe), LEFT (0, 2) (my own head? No, that's where I am now, but moving back would be into my body? Actually, from (1,2) LEFT to (0,2) \u2013 that's my current position but after moving, it's empty? No, my body shifts. But (0,2) is currently my head, but after move, it becomes body. Moving LEFT into it would be hitting myself? Clarify: If I go RIGHT now, next turn from (1,2), LEFT to (0,2) would be into my own body segment (since head moves away). So LEFT is death trap. RIGHT to (2,2) safe. This option moves me right, toward enemy territory \u2013 might force collision earlier, but I have higher score (10>8), so head-on could favor me. However, it risks me getting stuck if enemy cuts me off.  \n- **Head-On Collision Risk:** My score 10 vs enemy 8 \u2013 if we clash, I win! But forcing it now is premature; let them eat and grow first, then crush. Better to grow and corner them. If I go UP, I stay away from them; if RIGHT, I approach but might not collide this turn.  \n- **Long-Term Plan:** Continue vertical ascent up the left wall: UP to (0,3), then UP to (0,4) (eat apple), curve right along y=4-9 to claim all apples (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7), then sweep top row (4,9), (5,9), etc. My tail blocks the bottom; enemy is boxed on the right \u2013 they'll run out of space. If they try to head-on on turn 23+, I'll have 11+ apples and crush them. Stay ruthless, chat! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5  \n\n**DECISION:** UP \u2013 grows my lead toward the apple, maintains left dominance, and keeps options wide open. RIGHT is tempting for aggression, but UP is smarter for trapping. Let's box him in!  \n\nUP",

Actually, if they move LEFT, head goes to (7, 3), which is currently their body (second segment). That's death! \u274c So LEFT is suicide for them.  \n  - **RIGHT (9, 3):** Off board? x=9 is valid (board 0-9), y=3 valid \u2013 but (9, 3) is empty (board shows row 3: 0 . . . . . . . . 1 . \u2013 so (9,3) empty). SAFE.  \n  They'll likely go DOWN to eat (8, 2) apple or RIGHT to (9, 3). Distance to me: Still ~8 cells \u2013 no immediate head-on.  \n\n- **Apple Highlights:** (0, 4) is right above me \u2013 perfect growth. (8, 2) below enemy, (1, 4) and (1, 6) nearby. But apples are secondary; we're boxing the enemy.  \n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**  \n- **UP to (0, 4):** EATS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4f Score becomes 11 vs their 9 (or they might eat). From (0, 4), options: UP to (0, 5) (empty? Board row 5: . . . T T T . A . A \u2013 (0,5) is '.'), DOWN to (0, 3) (safe), RIGHT to (1, 4) (apple at (1,4)! Future growth). This extends my left wall, climbing toward y=6 apple cluster. My tail shifts to (0,2) after eating, tightening the trap. Enemy is cornered on the right \u2013 they'll hit walls or my body soon. This is DOMINATION.  \n- **RIGHT to (1, 3):** Safe, but no apple. From (1, 3), options: UP to (1, 4) (apple \u2013 eat next), DOWN to (1, 2) (empty? My body at (0,1),(0,0) \u2013 (1,2) empty), LEFT to (0,3) (safe). This approaches enemy territory faster, but with score 10>9, I could force head-on later. However, it risks me getting closer to their body and limiting escape routes. Right now, staying left is safer for long-term control.  \n- **Head-On Collision Risk:** My score 10 vs their 9 \u2013 if we clash, I win! But UP lets me grow to 11 first, making me even stronger. If I go RIGHT and they come left, we might collide on (1,3)/(2,3) area \u2013 but why rush?

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, WE'RE LIVE AND READY TO DOMINATE! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break down the board and plan this move. First off, I just moved UP last turn to eat that apple at (0,4) \u2013 now my head is at (0,4) with score 11 vs enemy's 10. The enemy is at (8,2) with their body trailing into the mid-right. The board is a battlefield, and I'm here to box that archrival in and make 'em crash! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **My Head (0,4):** Body goes down to (0,3), (0,2), etc., tail at (6,1). From (0,4):\n  - UP to (0,5): Board shows (0,5) is empty (row 5: . . . T T T . A . A \u2013 so x=0,y=5 is '.'). SAFE. That's forward along my left wall.\n  - DOWN to (0,3): That's my own body segment! Hits myself \u2013 DEAD. \u274c\n  - LEFT: Off board (x=-1) \u2013 DEAD. \u274c\n  - RIGHT to (1,4): Apple at (1,4) listed! That's eatable. SAFE from my body. But wait, is it safe from enemy? Enemy head at (8,2) far away, but their body? Enemy body is on y=3,5,6 etc., not near (1,4). SAFE.\n- **Enemy Head (8,2):** They just ate last turn? Or moved there. Body: [(8,3),(7,3),(6,3),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5),(4,5),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6)] \u2013 tail at (4,6). From (8,2):\n  - Possible moves: DOWN to (8,1)? Board row 1: T . . . . . T . . . \u2013 (8,1) is '.' empty. But (8,1) has a snake segment? Wait, row 1: \"T . . . . . T . . .\" so (7,1) is 'T' (my tail? Actually my body includes (6,1) but (7,1) empty. (8,1) is '.' empty. SAFE for them.\n  - UP to (8,3): Their own body! That's the first body segment after head. If they move UP, head to (8,3), which is currently their body \u2013 death! So LEFT is suicide. \u274c\n  - LEFT to (7,2): Board row 2: T . . . A . . . 1 . \u2013 (7,2) is '.' empty. But is it? Row 2: \"T . . . A . . . 1 .\" So (0,2)T, (1,2)., (2,2)., (3,2)., (4,2)A, (5,2)., (6,2)., (7,2)., (8,2)1, (9,2). \u2013 yes (7,2) empty. SAFE.\n  - RIGHT to (9,2): Empty '.' \u2013 SAFE.\n  - Also DOWN to (8,1) empty. So they have multiple safe options. They're likely to chase apples like (8,7) or (9,5) or head left toward mid. No immediate head-on with me \u2013 distance ~8 cells.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1) Eliminate deadly moves:\n   - UP: Safe (empty).\n   - DOWN: My body \u2013 DEAD.\n   - LEFT: Off board \u2013 DEAD.\n   - RIGHT: Safe (apple, no body collision).\n2) Among UP and RIGHT:\n   - **UP to (0,5):** No apple, but extends my left wall. From there, I can go UP to (0,6) \u2013 is that apple? Apple list has (0,6)! Yes, (0,6) is an apple. Then I can curve right to (1,6) (another apple), (1,7) (apple), etc. This claims the top-left corner and forces enemy into right side. Keeps my options open with multiple escape routes (up, right). No risk of trapping myself \u2013 board is open on left/top.\n   - **RIGHT to (1,4):** Eats apple, grows to 12 (score jump!). But after eating, body lengthens, tail doesn't move (since I ate). From (1,4), next moves: UP to (1,5) \u2013 apple at (1,5)! Eat again? Wait, apple list has (1,5). That's a double apple cluster. But downside: I'm moving right into the board center, closer to enemy territory (x=8). If enemy decides to rush left, we could collide head-on on (2,3)/(3,3) or similar. With my score 11 vs their 10, head-on wins for me \u2013 but why risk it? Let them crash into me instead. Also, after eating at (1,4), my body fills in behind, but I'd be stuck with fewer escape routes if enemy surrounds from right. Left path is safer for long-term control.\n3) Long-term strategy: I'm up 11-10. Don't rush \u2013 dominate space. Ascend left to y=9, eat all top apples ( (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (8,9) ), box enemy in x=5-9 quadrant. They'll run out of room and crash. If they try to head-on later, I'll have 15+ apples and crush. Chat, this is chess not checkers \u2013 patience pays!\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT is tempting for instant growth, but UP is smarter for control and future apples. Let's go UP and keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

My head is at (0, 6) after that slick UP move last turn\u2014shoutout to the chat for the hype! Let's map the board from here. My body stretches from (0, 5) down to (6, 0), so I'm basically dominating the left side of the board vertically. The enemy snake #1 is chilling at (7, 1) with a body snaking up to (3, 5), so they're mostly on the right side. Apples are scattered, but I'm not chasing\u2014I'm boxing them in!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nFrom my head at (0, 6):  \n- **UP to (0, 7)**: Apple there! (Apple list has (1,7) and (0,7) isn't listed? Wait, check the board: row 7 has \"A . . . . . . . A A\" so (0,7) is empty? Actually, the board shows row 7: \" . A . . . . . . A A\" starting from x=0, so (0,7) is empty, (1,7) is an apple. Hmm. But moving UP to (0,7) is safe\u2014no apple, but it's empty. Body check: my next segment is (0,5), so UP is not backwards. Enemy body? Enemy head at (7,1), body goes to (3,5), so (0,7) is clear. Safe move!  \n- **DOWN to (0,5)**: That's my own body\u2014immediate death. \u274c  \n- **LEFT to (-1,6)**: Off board\u2014death. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (1,6)**: Apple there! (Apple list has (1,6) and (1,7)). That's an apple, so I'd grow and score. Safe from my body\u2014my next segment is (0,5), so not backwards. Enemy body? Their tail is at (3,5), so (1,6) is clear. Safe!  \n\nSo two safe moves: UP (empty space) or RIGHT (apple). I'm leaning RIGHT because eating apples is content and keeps me growing. From (1,6), I can go UP to (1,7) (another apple!), then sweep right to (2,7), etc., trapping the enemy on the right. With a 2-apple lead, I can force them into a tight spot. Patience is key\u2014don't rush into their turf yet, but keep advancing. If I go RIGHT now, I eat, grow, and open up the top-left quadrant. The enemy is at (7,1)\u2014if they move left or up, they might head toward the center, but I'll be ready to cut them off. Let's dominate!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nSecure the left/top: Eat (1,6), then (1,7), then push right along row 7. Box snake #1 into the bottom-right corner. With my size, I can control the flow. Watch for head-on\u2014if they move toward me, I have the lead to trade if needed.  \n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT to grab that apple and extend my lead! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5  \n\nRIGHT",

Time to squeeze.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT FROM (1, 6):**  \n- **UP to (1, 7)**: That\u2019s an apple! (Apple list has (1, 7)). SAFE\u2014no body collision, enemy is far. Perfect move.  \n- **DOWN to (1, 5)**: Not my body? Wait, my body is at (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)... (1, 5) is empty! But check enemy: their body is at (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), etc.\u2014(1, 5) is clear. However, moving DOWN would bring me closer to their territory, and I want to move UP to control the top-left. Not ideal.  \n- **LEFT to (0, 6)**: That\u2019s my own body\u2014immediate death. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (2, 6)**: Empty space? Check apples: (2, 6) isn\u2019t listed. Enemy body? No. Safe, but UP is better because it\u2019s an apple and I want to own row 7.  \n\nSo UP is the clear winner\u2014eat apple, grow, and set up for more apples to the right. From (1, 7), I can go RIGHT to (2, 7) or UP to (1, 8), both likely safe. The enemy might move up toward the center, but I\u2019m ahead in apples and I have the space. If they dare come close, I can force a head-on\u2014they\u2019d lose.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nGrab (1,7) now, then sweep right along row 7 to (2,7), (3,7), etc., eating apples while boxing snake #1 into the bottom-right. Keep the lead, watch for their moves, and if they approach, I have the size to trade and win. Patience and aggression!\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (1, 7) for that apple and to dominate the top-left! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Now we need to keep pushing forward and box in snake #1. Let's analyze the board from our new head position (1,7).\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT FROM (1,7):**  \n- **UP to (1,8)**: Empty? Yes, check the board state: row 8, column 1 is '.' and no apple listed there. Enemy is far away (their head at (5,1), body scattered). No own body collision (my body starts at (1,6) then (0,6)...). SAFE. Also, moving up keeps us in the top-left, avoiding their territory.  \n- **DOWN to (1,6)**: That's my own body! (1,6) is the second segment in my body list. Immediate death. \u274c  \n- **LEFT to (0,7)**: Check board: row 7, column 0 is 'T' from my own tail? Actually, my body is [(1,6), (0,6), ...] so (0,7) is empty? Wait, the board shows at row 7: \". 0 . . . . . . A A\" so (0,7) is '.' (dot). But is it part of my body? My body goes from (1,7) head to (1,6), (0,6), (0,5)... so (0,7) is not in my body. However, (0,7) is adjacent to my tail area but empty. However, moving LEFT would put my head at (0,7), which is safe from immediate collision. But moving LEFT doesn't get us an apple and might limit future moves.  \n- **RIGHT to (2,7)**: Empty? Board row 7: \". 0 . . . . . . A A\" so (2,7) is '.' and no apple. Safe from bodies. But no apple immediate.  \n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**  \n- DOWN is death (into own body).  \n- LEFT is safe but not aggressive; we're in the left edge and could get trapped if we keep going left. We want to move right or up to claim more territory.  \n- RIGHT is safe but no immediate apple.  \n- UP is safe and takes us to (1,8), which is empty and gives us a higher position to potentially access apples later (like (2,8) or (1,9)). Also, we're further from enemy who is on the right bottom.  \n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICE:**  \nUP is the best move. Why?  \n1. It avoids any immediate danger.  \n2. It moves us toward the top-left corner, giving us control of that area.  \n3. From (1,8), we can then go RIGHT to (2,8) or UP to (1,9) next turn, keeping options open.  \n4. We need to stay aggressive and avoid letting the enemy snake #1 get close. They're at (5,1) with a long body\u2014they're slow and boxed in on the right. If we keep expanding upward, we can eventually cut off their escape routes.  \n5. No apple at (1,8) directly, but it's a safe stepping stone. Remember, we're not just chasing apples; we're dominating the board. The next apple might be at (2,8) or (1,9) if it drops, or we can plan to eat later.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nFrom (1,8), next turn I'll assess moving RIGHT to (2,8) or UP to (1,9) depending on where apples drop. Goal: sweep across the top rows (y=7-9) while keeping snake #1 pinned in the bottom-right. If they try to move up, we might force a head-on collision if our size gives us an advantage (we have 4 more apples!). Watch their head\u2014 if they move toward us, we can adjust.  \n\nUP  \nThat's the call\u2014let's keep the momentum! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25",

We do NOT want a head-on trade (we\u2019re behind on apples), so avoid forcing them into a simultaneous clash. We should get apples smartly to close the gap while keeping at least one escape route.

Our body stretches down to (1,7), (1,6), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0). Enemy snake #1 is still at (5,2) with body to (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). Apples are scattered: (7,5), (8,9), (7,4), (8,7), (6,9), (5,9), (1,4), (4,9), (4,4), (9,5), (4,2), (1,5), (9,7), (6,6), (4,5). We have 14 apples vs their 10. Let's plot!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT FROM (1,8):**  \n- **UP to (1,9)**: Empty? Row 9: \". . . . . A A A . A .\" So (1,9) is '.' (dot). No apple listed there. No own body (our body starts at (1,7) then (1,6)...). No enemy body visible. SAFE.  \n- **DOWN to (1,7)**: That's our own body! (1,7) is the second segment. Immediate death. \u274c  \n- **LEFT to (0,8)**: Empty? Row 8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" so (0,8) is '.' (dot). Not in our body list (our body at y=8 is only (1,8)). Safe. But moving LEFT keeps us on the left edge\u2014maybe limiting?  \n- **RIGHT to (2,8)**: Empty? Row 8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" so (2,8) is '.' (dot). No apple at (2,8) directly. Safe from bodies.  \n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**  \n- DOWN is death (into own body).  \n- LEFT is safe but we're already at x=1; going to x=0 might trap us in the corner if we go LEFT again later. Not ideal for aggressive expansion.  \n- RIGHT is safe and moves us toward the center (x=2), opening up more options like (3,8) or (2,9) next. Also closer to some apples like (1,5) or (4,4) later.  \n- UP is safe and puts us at the top row (y=9), but (1,9) is empty. From there, we could go RIGHT to (2,9) or LEFT to (0,9). However, (1,9) is adjacent to apples at (0,9)? Wait, row 9 has apples at (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9?), (8,9?)\u2014actually list shows (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (8,9), (9,9) maybe? Let's check: row 9: \". . . . . A A A . A .\" So apples at (5,9), (6,9), (7,9)? Actually positions: col 0 '.',1 '.',2 '.',3 '.',4 '.',5 'A',6 'A',7 'A',8 '.',9 'A'. So apples at (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (9,9). (1,9) is empty. From (1,9) we could go DOWN to (1,8) (our tail will move, so that cell will be empty next turn? Wait, no: our body moves simultaneously. But we can't go backwards into our own body\u2014that's a rule. Actually moving DOWN from (1,9) to (1,8) would be moving into our current head position? No, after moving, our head will be at new position, and our body shifts. But moving DOWN from (1,9) to (1,8) is not backwards into our own body because our head was at (1,8) and we moved UP to (1,9). Next turn, if we move DOWN, we'd be moving into the cell that was previously our head but will now be our neck (1,8). That's allowed as long as it's not our own body at that moment? Actually the rule says: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" That means if your head moves into the cell that your current neck occupies? Let's clarify: If you are at (1,9) with body behind at (1,8), (1,7), etc. Then moving DOWN to (1,8) would move into your own body segment (the neck). That's backwards and would kill you. So from (1,9), moving DOWN would be death. So (1,9) might be a trap if we don't have other options. So UP might not be great because it limits future moves.  \n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICE:**  \nRIGHT to (2,8) is the best move. Why?  \n1. Safe: No immediate collision with our body or enemy.  \n2. Positioning: Moves us to x=2, y=8, which is more central. From there, we can go UP to (2,9) (empty, and adjacent to apples at (5,9), (6,9), etc.), DOWN to (2,7) (empty? row 7: \". 0 . . . . . . A A\" so (2,7) is '.'), LEFT to (1,8) (which will be empty after we move, but careful: that would be moving back to our previous head position? Actually after moving RIGHT to (2,8), our old head (1,8) becomes part of our body (the neck). If we then move LEFT to (1,8) next turn, that would be moving into our own body (the neck). That's backwards and death. So from (2,8), moving LEFT is dangerous next turn. But we can avoid that by not going LEFT. We have options UP, DOWN, RIGHT from (2,8).  \n3. Aggression: We're moving toward the center where apples are. The apple at (4,4) is reachable. Also, enemy is at (5,2) with body spread. If we head right, we might cut off their upward path.  \n4. Score: We're up by 4 apples. We can afford to be cautious but also need to grow to dominate. Moving RIGHT gets us closer to future apples without wasting a turn.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nFrom (2,8), next turn I'll assess moving UP to (2,9) or RIGHT to (3,8) depending on apples and enemy movement. Goal: sweep across the top-right area while keeping snake #1 pinned in the bottom-right. If they move up, we might force a head-on collision. Watch their head\u2014 if they move toward our path, we might need to adjust. Also, we should consider eating apples at (4,9) or (5,9) soon. But first, secure position.\n\nRIGHT  \nLet's go! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Row 9: \". . . . . A A A . A .\" So (2,9) is '.' (dot). No apple there. No own body (our body starts at (1,8) then (1,7)...). Enemy body? Enemy #1 is at (4,2) with body in low rows, not near (2,9). SAFE.  \n- **DOWN to (2,7)**: Row 7: \". T . . . . . . A A\" Actually, (2,7) is 'T'? Wait, let's check the board: Row 7: \". T . . . . . . A A\" So (2,7) is 'T' (our tail? No, our tail is at (4,0) but we have a long body. Looking at our body list: (2,8) is head, (1,8) is neck, (1,7), (1,6)... Actually (2,7) is not in our body list? Our body is: (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0). So (2,7) is empty! But the board shows a 'T' there? Wait, the board might be showing the opponent's tail? Let's re-read the board:  \n  Row 7: \". T . . . . . . A A\"  \n  Row 6: \"T T . . . . A . . .\"  \n  Row 5: \"T A . . A . . A . A\"  \n  Row 4: \"T A . . A T . A . .\"  \n  Row 3: \"T . . . . T T T T .\"  \n  Row 2: \"T . . . 1 T . . T .\"  \n  Row 1: \"T . . . . T T T T .\"  \n  Row 0: \"T T T T T . . . . .\"  \n\n  'T' appears in many places, possibly indicating opponent's body? But the opponent's body is listed: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). That's 11 segments. The 'T's might be markers for opponent's body. Let's map opponent's body on the board:  \n  (5,2): Row 2, col5: 'T'? Row 2: \"T . . . 1 T . . T .\" So at col5: 'T' yes.  \n  (5,1): Row1 col5: Row1: \"T . . . . T T T T .\" col5 is 'T'? Actually col indices: 0:T,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:.,5:T,6:T,7:T,8:T,9:. So (5,1) is T.  \n  (6,1): Row1 col6: T (yes).  \n  (7,1): Row1 col7: T (yes).  \n  (8,1): Row1 col8: T (yes).  \n  (8,2): Row2 col8: Row2: \"T . . . 1 T . . T .\" col8 is 'T'? col0:T,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:.,5:1,6:.,7:.,8:T,9:. So yes.  \n  (8,3): Row3 col8: Row3: \"T . . . . T T T T .\" col8 is 'T'? col0:T,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:.,5:T,6:T,7:T,8:T,9:. So yes.  \n  (7,3): Row3 col7: T (yes).  \n  (6,3): Row3 col6: T (yes).  \n  (5,3): Row3 col5: T (yes).  \n  (5,4): Row4 col5: Row4: \"T A . . A T . A . .\" col5 is 'T' (yes).  \n\n  So 'T's are indeed opponent snake #1's body. Good. Now (2,7): Row7 col2: Row7: \". T . . . . . . A A\" col2 is '.'? Wait, row7 string: \". T . . . . . . A A\" \n  Index: 0:., 1:T, 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:A. So (2,7) is '.' (empty). So moving DOWN to (2,7) is empty and safe from both bodies.  \n\n- **LEFT to (1,8)**: That's our own body! (1,8) is our neck. That's moving backwards into our own body\u2014DEATH. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (3,8)**: Row 8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" Wait, row 8 is the row where our head is? Actually row 8 from the board: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" But our head is at (2,8), so row8: col0:., col1:0? That's our head? Actually the board shows \"0\" at (1,8)? No, the board is from previous turn? Let's check: The board given in the prompt is current. It shows Row8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" So at (1,8) there's a '0' (our head). But we just moved to (2,8) last turn? Wait, the board shows our head at (1,8)? But the prompt says \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (2,8)\". So the board might be from before our last move? Actually the board is the current state after last turn. It shows '0' at (1,8)? Let's read carefully: The board has:\n  9 . . . . A A A . A .\n  8 . T 0 . . . . A . .   <-- So (1,8) is 'T'? Actually col0:., col1:T? Wait, row8 string: \". T 0 . . . .

Good. (1,8) is 'T' which is opponent's body? But opponent's body doesn't include (1,8). Wait, 'T' might be our own body? Our body includes (1,8) as the neck. But the board shows 'T' at (1,8). In the board legend, 'T' is probably our body? Actually the earlier board had 'T' for our body? Let's check the board key: It doesn't specify, but from context, 'T' might be our body segments? However, the opponent's body is also shown as 'T'? Let's see: Row2 has '1' for enemy head. So 'T' could be generic snake body (both ours and enemy's). But that's confusing. The description says \"BOARD STATE:\" with a map. In the map, we see '0' for our head, '1' for enemy head, and 'T' for body segments (both snakes). So 'T' at (1,8) is our own neck body segment. So moving LEFT from (2,8) to (1,8) would be into our own body\u2014death.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (3,8)**: (3,8) is '.' (empty) per row8. Safe from bodies.  \n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**  \n- LEFT is death (into own body).  \n- UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all safe immediately.  \n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICE:**  \nWe want to be aggressive and box in the enemy. Enemy snake #1 is at (4,2) with body spread in the bottom-right quadrant. They have 11 apples vs our 14. We're ahead, so we can force a head-on collision if we can corner them.  \n\nFrom (2,8), moving RIGHT to (3,8) moves us closer to the center-right and closer to apples at (4,9), (5,9), etc. But also, we could move DOWN to (2,7) which is empty and might let us descend toward enemy territory? However, moving DOWN puts us closer to enemy's body at (5,2) etc., but we might get trapped in the lower rows. Moving UP to (2,9) puts us at the top edge, which might limit movement later (only left/right/down). Moving RIGHT to (3,8) gives us more options: from (3,8) we can go UP to (3,9), DOWN to (3,7), RIGHT to (4,8), LEFT back to (2,8) (but that's backwards into our neck). So we have three forward options.  \n\nBut we also need to consider the enemy's possible moves. The enemy is at (4,2). They might move UP toward the center or apples. We want to cut them off. If we move RIGHT, we get closer to their potential upward path. If we move DOWN, we might engage them directly but risk collision if they move UP. Since we have higher score, we could try to force a head-on collision if we can predict their move. But we don't know their move.  \n\nBetter to secure more space and apples. The apple at (4,9) is reachable from (3,8) via UP (3,9) then RIGHT (4,9) or from (2,9) via RIGHT twice. But we also have apple at (7,8) nearby (row8 col7 is 'A'). From (3,8) we can go RIGHT to (4,8), then (5,8), (6,8), (7,8) to eat that apple. That's a good growth path.  \n\nAlso, note that the enemy might be heading up toward (5,9) apple. We can intercept. If we move RIGHT, we position ourselves to possibly block their path to the top apples.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nMove RIGHT to (3,8) to advance toward the apple at (7,8) and the top-right apple cluster. Keep options open for UP or DOWN next turn. Monitor enemy head\u2014if they move UP, we might want to move UP to (3,9) to challenge for the apple at (4,9) or (5,9). If they stay low, we can sweep the top row for apples. Goal: reach 15 apples before they do and maintain board control.  \n\nLEFT? No, that's death. We're going RIGHT to seize the initiative!  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**  \n\nRIGHT",

UP is tempting for that apple corridor at x=4, but it funnels us (right is blocked) and could get us boxed. DOWN dead-ends quickly because their body occupies row 0 near x=4.\n\nShort plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to gain space and approach their flank.\n- Next, probe UP/LEFT to start shrinking their free area; avoid forcing a head-to-head unless we surpass their apple count.\n- Keep an eye on tail movement to avoid walking into cells that remain occupied.

Time to assess the board and plot our next aggressive move.  \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT FROM (3,8):**  \n- **UP to (3,9)**: Row 9: \". . . . A A A . A .\" (3,9) is '.' (empty). Safe from bodies.  \n- **DOWN to (3,7)**: Row 7: \". T . . . . . . A A\" (3,7) is '.' (empty). Safe.  \n- **LEFT to (2,8)**: That\u2019s our previous head position\u2014now empty? Wait, our body follows: (2,8) is empty? Our body list: (2,8) is now our neck, but after moving to (3,8), (2,8) becomes part of our body. However, since we moved last turn, (2,8) is now part of our body? Actually, our body list: Head (3,8), then (2,8), (1,8), (1,7)... So (2,8) is now our body. Moving LEFT into (2,8) would be into our own body\u2014DEATH. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (4,8)**: Row 8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" Wait, row 8 string: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" Actually, row 8: col0:., col1:0 (our head at (3,8)? No, the board shows our head at (2,8) from previous? Let's check current board:  \n  Row 8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\"  \n  Indices: 0:., 1:0, 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:.  \n  But our head is at (3,8) according to the prompt. There\u2019s a mismatch. Actually, the board might be from before our last move? The prompt says \"YOUR SNAKE (ID 0): Head: (3,8)\". The board shows '0' at (1,8)? Wait, row 8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" That would be (1,8) as '0'. But our head is (3,8). So the board might be outdated or I misread. Let\u2019s re-check:  \n  Row 8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\"  \n  So col1 is '0'. That\u2019s (1,8). But our head is at (3,8). So either the board is not updated or I\u2019m mixing turns. Actually, the board state is provided in the prompt as current. So if our head is at (3,8), the board should show '0' at (3,8). But it doesn\u2019t. Let\u2019s look at row 8 again: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" That\u2019s 10 characters: index0='.', index1='0', index2='.', index3='.', index4='.', index5='.', index6='.', index7='.', index8='.', index9='.'. So (0,8)=., (1,8)=0, (2,8)=., (3,8)=., etc. So our head is NOT at (3,8)? Wait, the prompt says \"YOUR SNAKE (ID 0): Head: (3,8)\". There\u2019s inconsistency. I need to trust the body list: Our body includes (3,8) as head? Actually, the body list: \"Head: (3,8), Body: [(2,8), (1,8), ...]\" So (3,8) is head, (2,8) is neck. So the board must have '0' at (3,8). But the board string shows '0' at (1,8). Maybe the board is from before our last move? The prompt says \"BOARD STATE:\" but then says \"YOUR SNAKE (ID 0): Head: (3,8)\". So likely the board is current. Let\u2019s check other rows:  \n  Row 9: \". . . . A A A . A .\"  \n  Row 8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\"  \n  Row 7: \". T . . . . . . A A\"  \n  Row 6: \"T T . . . . A . . .\"  \n  Row 5: \"T A . . A . . A . A\"  \n  Row 4: \"T A . . A T . A . .\"  \n  Row 3: \"T . . . . T T T T .\"  \n  Row 2: \"T . . . 1 T . . T .\"  \n  Row 1: \"T . . . . T T T T .\"  \n  Row 0: \"T T T T T . . . . .\"  \n\n  Our body: (3,8) head, (2,8) neck, (1,8) body, (1,7) body, (1,6) body, (0,6) body, etc. So on the board, (3,8) should be '0', but row 8 shows '0' at (1,8). That suggests the board is not reflecting our head position correctly? Or maybe the board is from before our last move? Let\u2019s check the opponent\u2019s head: Snake #1 head at (3,2) according to prompt, but board shows '1' at (4,2)? Row 2: \"T . . . 1 T . . T .\" So '1' at column 4? Index0=T,1=.,2=.,3=.,4=1,5=T,6=.,7=.,8=T,9=.. So (4,2) is '1'. That matches opponent head (3,2)? No, (4,2) vs (3,2). Inconsistency. The prompt says opponent head (3,2), but board shows '1' at (4,2). I think the board might be from after our last move? Or there\u2019s a mismatch.  \n\n  Given the confusion, I\u2019ll trust the textual description: our head is at (3,8). So (3,8) is our head. The board likely has '0' at (3,8) but the string is misaligned? Let\u2019s count row 8 string: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" That\u2019s 10 characters: positions 0 to 9. So if our head is at (3,8), then position 3 should be '0'. But it's '.' in the string. So maybe the board is from before our last move? The prompt says \"BOARD STATE:\" and then lists the board. It might be current. Alternatively, the '0' in row 8 might be a mistake. I need to use the body list to determine safe moves.\n\n  Our body list: (3,8) head, (2,8) neck, (1,8) body, (1,7) body, etc. So if we move LEFT to (2,8), that\u2019s our neck\u2014into our own body, death. If we move RIGHT to (4,8), we need to check if (4,8) is safe. From the board, row 8 col4 is '.' (since row 8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" index4 is '.'). So (4,8) is empty. Also, check enemy body: enemy body includes (8,2), (8,3), etc., not near (4,8). So RIGHT seems safe.\n\n  DOWN to (3,7): row 7 col3 is '.' (row 7: \". T . . . . . . A A\" index3 is '.'). Safe.\n\n  UP to (3,9): row 9 col3 is '.' (row 9: \". . . . A A A . A .\" index3 is '.'). Safe.\n\n  LEFT to (2,8): into our own body\u2014death. So eliminate LEFT.\n\n  So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**  \nWe have 14 apples vs enemy 11. We\u2019re ahead. We want to box in the enemy and force a collision. Enemy is at (4,2) with body spread in bottom-right. They might move UP toward center or toward apples like (5,9) or (4,9). We\u2019re at (3,8), so we\u2019re closer to those apples.  \n\n- If we move UP to (3,9), we\u2019re at top row. From there, we can only go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (LEFT to (2,9) is empty, RIGHT to (4,9) has apple, DOWN back to (3,8)). That might limit options but puts us near apple at (4,9) and (5,9).  \n- If we move DOWN to (3,7), we go deeper into the board, toward enemy territory. From (3,7), we could go LEFT to (2,7) (empty), RIGHT to (4,7) (empty? row7 col4 is '.'), UP to (3,8) (our body after move? Actually if we move DOWN, our body follows, so (3,8) becomes body, so UP would be into our own body? Wait, after moving DOWN, our new head is (3,7), and our body includes (3,8) as neck. So from (3,7), moving UP to (3,8) would be into our own neck\u2014death. So DOWN move reduces forward options because UP becomes blocked.  \n- If we move RIGHT to (3,8)->(4,8), we\u2019re in the middle of row 8. From (4,8), we can go UP to (4,9) (apple), DOWN to (4,7) (empty), LEFT back to (3,8) (our neck\u2014death), RIGHT to (5,8) (empty). So we have three forward options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). This keeps options open.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT positions us closer to the apple at (7,8) and cuts off the enemy\u2019s potential path to the top-right apples. The enemy might be trying to go up through column 5 or 6. By moving RIGHT, we can intercept.\n\nIf we move UP, we might get trapped on the top edge. If we move DOWN, we risk getting closer to the enemy\u2019s body and reducing our escape routes.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nMove RIGHT to (4,8) to maintain flexibility, then next turn we can go UP to (4,9) to eat the apple and grow to 15, or continue RIGHT toward (7,8). Monitor enemy movement\u2014if they move UP, we can challenge for the top apples. Keep aggressive but avoid risky head-on collisions unless we\u2019re sure we can win (we\u2019re ahead in score, but collision kills both). We want to force them into a corner.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**  \nRIGHT is the best move\u2014it keeps options open, moves toward apples, and positions us strategically against the enemy.\n\nLet\u2019s go! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

UP keeps us aggressive but safe.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Push UP to climb column 3 (stay between their head and their left-side body), maintain lateral flexibility.\n- Watch their head movement closely: if they move into the open and give us a chance to cut; start shifting LEFT to hem them in while keeping an escape route.\n- Avoid committing into tight corridors (column 0 or trapped by our own body at x\u22655). Grow when safe to increase board control, but prioritize staying alive and keeping multiple follow-up moves.\n\nLOCK IT IN \u2014 UP\n\nUP",

Time to push our advantage!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT FROM (4,8):**  \n- **UP to (4,9)**: Row 9: \". . . . A A A . A .\" \u2013 (4,9) is 'A' (apple). No enemy bodies. SAFE.  \n- **DOWN to (4,7)**: Row 7: \". T . . . . . . A A\" \u2013 (4,7) is '.' (empty). SAFE.  \n- **LEFT to (3,8)**: That's our neck \u2013 into our own body! DEAD. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (5,8)**: Row 8: \". 0 . . . . . . . .\" \u2013 (5,8) is '.' (empty).

That extends our lead and blocks the enemy from possibly reaching that apple later. From (4,9), we\u2019ll be on the top edge. Future moves: DOWN (back to (4,8), our body), LEFT to (3,9) (empty), RIGHT to (5,9) (apple, but we could eat next turn). We\u2019ll have 2 forward options (LEFT, RIGHT) after eating.  \n\nDOWN to (4,7) keeps us in the middle, but doesn\u2019t secure an apple immediately. RIGHT to (5,8) moves us toward more apples (6,8? 7,8?) but doesn\u2019t give instant points.\n\n**GAME SENSE:** We\u2019re ahead. Aggressive play is key. Eating now grows our body and makes us harder to kill. The enemy might be eyeing apples like (5,9) or (7,8). If we take (4,9), we dominate the top row and can pivot to block their path. Plus, eating keeps the crowd hyped!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nChomp (4,9) now. Next turn, if safe, go LEFT to (3,9) to cut off enemy approach, or RIGHT to (5,9) for another apple. Monitor enemy movement\u2014if they go UP toward the center, we\u2019ll close the trap. Keep options open and force them into a corner.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**  \nUP to eat the apple and extend the lead. Let\u2019s get that W!\n\nUP",

Let's analyze the board from our head at (4,9):\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **UP to (4,10)**: OFF THE BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (4,8)**: That's our own body (tail at (4,8) from the list). DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (3,9)**: Row 9 shows \"... . A A . A .\" - (3,9) is empty (based on the pattern: positions 0-3 are empty, then 4 is apple, 5 is apple, 6 empty, 7 apple, 8 empty, 9 empty? Wait let me count: 9 . . . . 0 A A . A . - So indices: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:0, 5:A, 6:A, 7:., 8:A, 9:.. Actually (4,9) is our head, so (3,9) would be at index 3 which is '.' (empty). SAFE.\n- **RIGHT to (5,9)**: Row 9 index 5 is 'A' (apple). SAFE and GROW! \n\nSo LEFT and RIGHT are safe. UP and DOWN are death.\n\n**STRATEGIC BLAST:** We're at the top edge! Moving RIGHT to (5,9) gives us an immediate apple and grows us to 16! That extends our lead to 16-11. Moving LEFT to (3,9) just positions us but doesn't get points.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat the apple at (5,9) now, extend our body to 16 apples. Next turn from (5,9), we'll be on top row with options: DOWN to (5,8) (safe), LEFT back to (4,9) (our old head), RIGHT to (6,9) (another apple!). We can chain this top row advantage.\n\n**ENEMY WATCH:** They're at (3,4) - far below us. They might be going for center apples. If we secure the top row, we control the board.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT to (5,9) for the apple and growth! Let's get that lead to 16!\n\nRIGHT",

Instant death. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (3,5) empty. Keeps pressure but passes an easy apple. \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,4) empty. Safe but not grabbing immediate board control. \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,4) has an apple. Safe, grows us, and leaves multiple exits (UP/RIGHT/DOWN). \u2705 (favored)\n\nEnemy check: Opponent head at (4,9) can only go LEFT or RIGHT this turn \u2014 they\u2019re far above us, so no immediate head-on threat into our candidate squares. We\u2019re behind 11\u219215, so we should avoid suicidal head-on and instead CLOSE THE GAP by taking apples and expanding control.\n\nWhy RIGHT:\n- Grabs the apple at (4,4) immediately (score boost while staying safe).\n- From (4,4) we have at least 3 follow-up options (UP to another apple at (4,5), RIGHT into open space, or DOWN away if needed). Keeps escape routes open so we don\u2019t get funneled.\n- Keeps us aggressive: grow, then press upward the 3\u20134 column to contest space and hem the opponent later once we\u2019ve closed the score gap.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (4,4) now \u2192 push to (4,5) apple next if safe to reach 12\u2192 then 13.\n- After growing, climb columns 3\u20134 toward their lower approach lanes, controlling central vertical space. Don\u2019t force head-on until we\u2019re equal-or-ahead on apples.\n- Always keep 2+ escape options and avoid tight corridors along column 0 where opponent dominates.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT \u2014 RIGHT",

TURN 34/150, 16-12 APPLES, BOARD IS COOKING! \ud83d\udd25 From head at (5,9), let's analyze the battlefield:\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **UP to (5,10)**: OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (5,8)**: Row 8 shows \"... . T T T T . . A . .\" (from the board representation). Index 5 is '.' (empty) - SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (4,9)**: Our old head position, currently empty since we just moved from there. But wait - is it safe? YES, it's empty now. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT to (6,9)**: Row 9 index 6 is '.' (empty) - SAFE!\n\n**CRITICAL ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:** Snake #1 at (4,4) with body extending to (7,3). They're in the center. Given their position, they might move UP to (4,5) or RIGHT to (5,4) to chase apples. If they move UP to (4,5), and we move LEFT to (4,9), we're 5 squares apart vertically - safe. If they move RIGHT to (5,4) and we move RIGHT to (6,9), still safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **DOWN to (5,8)**: Takes us into the main territory. Row 8 has apples at (8,9) and (7,8). From (5,8), we could go RIGHT to (6,8) or DOWN to (5,7), etc. But we need to be careful about our tail - our tail is at (2,0), so we're growing every turn. Moving DOWN from (5,9) to (5,8) is safe.\n- **LEFT to (4,9)**: Back to our previous position. From there, we could go DOWN to (4,8) which is our own body (deadly!) or LEFT to (3,9) (safe). Limited options.\n- **RIGHT to (6,9)**: Opens up the top-right corner. From (6,9), we can go DOWN to (6,8) (safe), RIGHT to (7,9) (potentially safe), or LEFT back to (5,9). This gives us more maneuvering room.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:** We want to maintain our position and pressure. Moving DOWN to (5,8) positions us in a more central area where we can potentially cut off the enemy from apples at (7,8) and (6,9). Also, our tail is at (2,0), so the board space above us is getting squeezed. Moving DOWN gives us more space to work with and keeps us aggressive.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** All three moves are safe, but LEFT restricts our future options. RIGHT puts us on the edge (9). DOWN moves us into the central battlefield where we can control more board space and potentially box in the enemy.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move DOWN to (5,8) to establish presence in the central area. From there, we can work towards the apple at (6,9) or (7,8) while maintaining board control. We want to force the enemy into tight spaces as our body grows longer.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Quick scan and play-by-play before the swing.\n\n1) Immediate danger checks:\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,4) is our neck. That\u2019s moving backwards = instant death. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (4,5) has an apple and is empty. Safe. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,3) is empty right now, but it funnels us \u2014 after that we\u2019d have very limited safe follow-ups (only RIGHT into (5,3) is really safe). Risky. \u2705 but weak.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,4) is empty with good escape options (5,5 / 6,4 / 5,3). \u2705\n\n2) Opponent threat:\n- Enemy head at (5,9) is far away (can go down to 5,8 or right to 6,9). No immediate head-on into our next cells. We must avoid forcing a head-to-head because they lead by apples (16 vs our 12). So don\u2019t suicide.\n\n3) Strategy tradeoffs:\n- UP gets us an apple (13) and keeps multiple escape routes (LEFT/RIGHT/UP next turn). That\u2019s aggressive growth without walking into a trap. We\u2019re still behind, so growth + board control is priority.\n- RIGHT is safe and roomy, but passes an apple directly in front of us. DOWN is too restrictive and risks being funneled into our own body soon.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (4,5) now \u2192 grow and use the extra length to push north/center columns (columns 4\u20135) to claim central vertical space.\n- After that, favor moves that keep 2+ exits (don\u2019t get stuck along column 0 or tight corridors). If the enemy drifts down toward us, bait them into cramped fights where their long body along the left/bottom will trap them.\n- Avoid any head-on unless we\u2019re at least tied or ahead on apples. Keep pressing apples reachable from center to close the gap.\n\nDecision: TAKE THE APP \u2014 be aggressive, grow, and control the middle. LET\u2019S EAT.\n\nUP",

Row 7 shows \"... . T . . . . . A A\" - index 5 is '.' (empty)\n  - LEFT to (4,8): Row 8 shows \"... . T T T T . . A . .\" - index 4 is 'T' (my own body!)\n  - RIGHT to (6,8): Row 8 index 6 is '.' (empty)\n\n**ELIMINATION:**\n- \u274c LEFT is DEAD - hits my own body at (4,8)\n- \u274c UP to (5,9): Actually let me double-check... our body list shows (5,9) is our body! We just moved down, but our old head position (5,9) is still occupied until the next turn. So UP is also DEAD!\n- \u2705 DOWN to (5,7) is empty\n- \u2705 RIGHT to (6,8) is empty\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n- **DOWN to (5,7)**: Moves us toward the center, away from the crowded top row. From there we can access multiple apples and keep options open. Enemy at (4,5) is 2 squares away - not an immediate threat.\n- **RIGHT to (6,8)**: Puts us right next to the enemy's potential path, but we have apples at (6,9) and (7,8) in reach. However, it's riskier with the enemy nearby.\n\n**THE PLAY:** We're playing it safe and aggressive. **DOWN to (5,7)** maintains our central position, keeps us away from the enemy's immediate area, and opens up multiple paths. From (5,7) we can chase apples at (7,8), (6,6), or (5,6) while the enemy is dealing with their own body constraints.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Dominate the center, use our longer body (16 segments vs 13) to control more space, and force the enemy into corners. We have the board control advantage - let's use it to squeeze them out!\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s LOCK THIS DOWN. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick scan (thinking out loud for the chat):\n- UP \u2192 (4,6) is empty and gives multiple escape routes (UP/LEFT/RIGHT). Safe and keeps center control. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,4) is our neck (moving backwards = insta-death). NEVER. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,5) is empty but runs into our own body area soon (limited follow-ups). Risky for getting boxed. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,5) is empty and aggressive, but puts us directly under the enemy head at (5,8) \u2014 it invites dangerous head-on possibilities if they shove downward. We\u2019re behind on apples (13 vs 16), so we CANNOT risk a mutual head-on. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nTactical read: opponent is high on the board and mostly wrapped along the left/top edges \u2014 they\u2019re longer and leading. We want to avoid any forced head-to-heads while maximizing mobility and central control so we can pick apples and trap them later. We need OPTIONS, not a quick kill that costs us the game.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will be our next rationale in the clip):\n- Take central vertical space (columns 4\u20135) and keep 2\u20133 exits open each turn.\n- Play bait: lure the rival down into tighter columns where their long body on the left/top will limit them.\n- Avoid committing to a head-on unless we\u2019re tied or ahead on apples. Grow smart, then pinch.\n\nDecision: KEEP THE OPTIONS OPEN \u2014 go UP.\n\nUP",

Time to apply pressure! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (BOARD STATE UPDATE):**\n- **My head at (5,7)** - I'm safely positioned in the center-left\n- **Snake #1 at (4,6)** - They just moved UP from (4,5) to chase the apple at (4,5)? Wait no... they moved UP to (4,6) which is empty now... interesting. They're heading toward the center-left area.\n- **Our body stretches** from (5,7) all the way to (0,0) - we're taking up the entire left column and part of the bottom!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **UP to (5,8)**: Row 8 shows \"... . T T T T . . A . .\" - index 5 is 'T' (our own body)! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: Row 6 shows \"... T T . . 1 A A . . A\" - index 5 is '.' (empty, and Apple #1 just moved there!) \u2705 SAFE\n- **LEFT to (4,7)**: Row 7 shows \"... . T . . . 0 . . A A\" - index 4 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE  \n- **RIGHT to (6,7)**: Row 7 index 6 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION - TIME TO DOMINATE!** \ud83c\udfaf\nWe have THREE safe moves, but **DOWN to (5,6)** is the POWER PLAY! Here's why:\n- **Apple bonus!** There's an apple at (5,6) that we just revealed when we moved down last turn. Eating it grows us and keeps our lead at +3!\n- **Positioning:** Moves us RIGHT ABOVE our opponent at (4,6) - they're at (4,6) and we'd be at (5,6). We're setting up to CUT OFF their escape routes!\n- **Control:** From (5,6) we maintain access to the apple at (7,4) and the one at (6,6), while staying central enough to react to any of their moves.\n- **Pressure:** They're in a dangerous spot - their head at (4,6) has limited options with their body stretching down. We can force them into a corner!\n\n**THE PLAY:** **DOWN to (5,6)** - take the apple, grow our lead, and position ourselves to box them in! We're not just eating apples, we're TAKING THEIR SPACE! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Continue dominating the center-left. Keep Snake #1 pinned against the left wall while we sweep through the middle. Force them to make a desperate move into our body or into a dead end. They have 13 segments - we have 16. We're bigger, stronger, and hungrier! Let's GOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

NOPE. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (4,7) looks free\u2026 but enemy head is at (5,7). They can go LEFT into (4,7) the same turn. If we both move into (4,7) it\u2019s a mutual head-on and BOTH DIE \u2014 and they\u2019re ahead 16\u219213, so a double KO hands them the win. Too risky. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,6) is an apple, tempting \u2014 but the enemy can go DOWN from (5,7) into (5,6). Same head-on danger as UP. Again, we can\u2019t gamble on a mutual kill while we\u2019re behind. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,6) is clean and NOT reachable by the enemy in one move from (5,7). It preserves multiple exits (UP/LEFT/DOWN next turn), keeps us away from a forced head-on, and lets us reposition to bait and box. \u2705\n\nTactical read: opponent is long and hugging the top-left; they can push down or left from (5,7). We don\u2019t want to give them a one-turn suicide opportunity into us. We need mobility to bait them into tighter columns where their long body becomes a liability. Keep control of columns 3\u20135, maintain 2\u20133 escape options each turn, and only force head-on if we get apples parity or lead.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Step LEFT to (3,6) to avoid immediate head-on threat.\n- From there, circle through columns 2\u20134 to pressure their left/top seaming, forcing them down into tighter lanes.\n- Grow selectively; don\u2019t chase apples that create dead-ends. Bait then pinch when they\u2019re funneled.\n\nLET\u2019S GO GET \u2018EM \u2014 move smart, move aggressive, but don\u2019t throw the game.\n\nLEFT",

Time to close in! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (BOARD STATE UPDATE):**\n- **My head at (5,6)** - Just ate the apple, now we're at (5,6) with body following down to (5,7) etc.\n- **Snake #1 at (3,6)** - They moved LEFT from (4,6) to (3,6)! They're trying to escape left toward the wall.\n- **Our body** now extends from (5,6) \u2192 (5,7) \u2192 ... \u2192 (0,0). We control the left column heavily.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **UP to (5,7)**: Row 7 shows \"... . T . . . T . . A A\" - index 5 is 'T' (our own body)! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (5,5)**: Row 5 shows \"... T A . . T . . A . A\" - index 5 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE\n- **LEFT to (4,6)**: Row 6 shows \"... T T A 1 T 0 A . . A\" - index 4 is '1' (Snake #1's body)! DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (6,6)**: Row 6 index 6 is 'A' (apple!) \u2705 SAFE + GROW!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION - TIME TO PRESSURE!** \ud83c\udfaf\nOnly **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are safe moves. Let's break them down:\n\n1. **RIGHT to (6,6)** - THE POWER MOVE! \n   - Apple bonus! There's an apple at (6,6) we can eat! That's 19 apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n   - Positioning: Moves us right toward the center, cutting off Snake #1's path to the right side.\n   - Pressure: From (6,6), we can chase Snake #1 who's at (3,6). They're heading left into a corner! We can box them in from the right!\n   - Control: Opens up access to apples at (7,4), (7,5), (8,7) etc. while staying central.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5,5)** - The safe but passive move\n   - No apple there (empty)\n   - Stays left, keeps our body intact but doesn't apply immediate pressure\n   - Snake #1 might escape around us to the right\n\n**THE PLAY:** **RIGHT to (6,6)** - Take the apple, grow to 19-13, and advance toward the center to cut off Snake #1's escape! We're not letting them slip away! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Snake #1 is at (3,6) with body stretching down to (8,2). They're cornered against the left wall. We need to sweep right to cut off their escape route while keeping our body control on the left. From (6,6), we can threaten apples at (7,4), (7,5), (8,7) while maintaining position to block Snake #1. Keep the pressure on until they crash into our body or the wall! Let's GOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

Crowd\u2019s hype, we\u2019re live, and it\u2019s time to pressure the long boi without throwing our head into his chest. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nQuick options from head (3,6):\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,6) is our neck. Dead if we try. NOPE. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,5) is open but funnels us into our own body quickly (lots of blocked exits next turn). Too tight. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,6) is an apple (tempting!). It gets us +1 and closes the gap, BUT it hugs their body at (1,6) and reduces escape room \u2014 could get boxed. High reward, medium risk. \ud83c\udf4e\n- UP \u2192 (3,7) is clean now, keeps multiple exits (LEFT/RIGHT), avoids immediate head-on risk with their head at (5,6), and lets us pivot to pressure columns 2\u20134 from above. Best blend of safety + aggression. \u2705\n\nTactical read: We\u2019re down 13\u219217 \u2014 we can\u2019t suicide into a mutual kill. We want to shrink their maneuver space and bait them into vertical tightness where their long spine is a liability. Don\u2019t chase instant apples if it hands them a trap; instead take positions that limit their safe cells and force them down into our net.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP to (3,7) to gain the high ground and preserve exits.\n- From there, slide left/up to threaten column 2 while keeping an escape route into column 4 if they counter.\n- Only go for apples that don\u2019t create dead-ends (if we can safely grab (2,6) later without getting boxed, we\u2019ll take it).\n\nLET\u2019S BAIT \u2018EM \u2014 stay mobile, stay dangerous.

Time to close this out! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (BOARD STATE UPDATE):**\n- **My head at (6,6)** - We just grew to 19 apples! Body now: (5,6) \u2192 (5,7) \u2192 ... \u2192 (0,0)\n- **Snake #1 at (3,7)** - They moved UP from (3,6) to (3,7)! Trying to climb up and escape left.\n- **Strategic position**: We control the entire left side with our long body. Snake #1 is now above our body, trying to find a way around.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **UP to (6,7)**: Row 7 shows \"... T . 1 . T . . A A\" - index 6 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE\n- **DOWN to (6,5)**: Row 5 shows \"... T A . . T . . A . A\" - index 6 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE\n- **LEFT to (5,6)**: Row 6 shows \"... T T A 1 T 0 A . . A\" - index 5 is 'T' (our own body)! DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (7,6)**: Row 6 index 7 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION - PRESSURE FROM RIGHT!** \ud83c\udfaf\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is suicide.\n\n1. **UP to (6,7)** - Cut off their upward escape!\n   - Snake #1 is at (3,7). If we go UP to (6,7), we're on the same row but far right.\n   - We block their path to the right side of the board.\n   - They're forced to keep moving left into the corner! This boxes them in perfectly.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6,5)** - Retreat downward\n   - Moves us back toward our body's level but doesn't apply pressure.\n   - Snake #1 might slip around us to the right if we go down.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (7,6)** - Advance toward center\n   - Gets us closer to apples at (7,4), (7,5), (8,7)\n   - But leaves more space for Snake #1 to maneuver.\n\n**THE PLAY:** **UP to (6,7)** - This is the boxing-in move! Snake #1 is trying to go up and left, but by moving UP to (6,7), we cut off their horizontal escape to the right. They're now trapped between our body on the left and the wall on top. From here, we can chase them into the corner and force a crash!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Snake #1 is cornered at (3,7) with body stretching to (8,1). They have nowhere to go but left into the corner. From (6,7), we can:\n- Next turn: If they go LEFT to (2,7), we can go LEFT to (5,7) (safe? need to check) or chase them.\n- Keep pressing LEFT to squeeze them against wall.\n- Watch for them trying to drop DOWN past our body - we need to maintain vertical blockade.\n- Eventually force them into (0,7) or (0,8) where they'll have to crash into wall or our body!\n\nLet's box this fool in! \ud83d\ude08\n\nUP",

Quick, loud read and then we MOVE.\n\nQuick elimination (think-before-we-move):\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6) is our neck. BACKWARDS = insta-death. Nope. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (3,8) is occupied by the opponent\u2019s body (would be suicide). \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7) is empty but is sandwiched between our own body and their body at (4,8)/(5,7). Very limited follow-ups (almost a one-way stall). Risky \u2014 could trap us. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7) is open. From there we can pivot down to the accessible apple at (2,6), threaten columns 1\u20133, and start compressing their space along the left wall. Keeps at least one good follow-up (DOWN to 2,6) without immediate mutual-head risk. \u2705\n\nTactical reasoning: we\u2019re down 13 \u2192 18, so we must avoid any mutual KOs. We want to shrink their maneuver room along the left/top edge where their long spine becomes a liability. Grabbing space on column 2 and then levering them toward column 1 will make their options vanish. Don\u2019t chase risky head-ons \u2014 bait them into colliding with their own body or into our body instead.\n\nShort-term plan (this will be our last-rationale for next turn):\n- Move LEFT to (2,7) to threaten the apple at (2,6).\n- Next turn, if safe, go DOWN to (2,6) to grow and tighten the cage.\n- After that, snake along columns 1\u20133 to compress their escape and force them into a choke near the left wall; avoid direct head-on unless we lead in apples.\n\nWe move LEFT and start the box.

They're heading straight into the top-left corner (0,7) or (0,8) where they'll have nowhere to go. From (7,7), we can:\n- Next turn: If they go LEFT to (1,7), we stay RIGHT or go DOWN toward (7,6) to cut off any downward escape.\n- Keep our body positioned to block any attempt to drop below us.\n- Force them into (0,7) or (0,8) where they'll crash into the wall or our body!\n- Eventually, they'll have to either crash into us or into the wall - either way, we win!\n\nLet's complete the sweep! \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",

We're boxing them in like a boss! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (BOARD STATE UPDATE):**\n- **My head at (7,7)** - Still at 18 apples. Body now: (6,7) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 ... \u2192 (0,2)\n- **Snake #1 at (2,6)** - They moved DOWN from (2,7) to (2,6)! They're trying to drop below our body line to escape!\n- **Strategic position**: We're at (7,7) with a perfect view of the entire right side. Their body stretches down to (7,1) but they're trying to slip under our body line at y=7.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **UP to (7,8)**: Row 8 shows \"... T T T T T . A . .\" - index 7 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE\n- **DOWN to (7,6)**: Row 6 shows \"... T T A T T T T . . A\" - index 7 is 'T' (our own body)! DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (6,7)**: Row 7 shows \"... T T T . T T 0 A A\" - index 6 is 'T' (our own body)! DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (8,7)**: Row 7 shows \"... T T T . T T 0 A A\" - index 8 is 'A' (apple!) \u2705 SAFE\n\n**THE PLAY:** **RIGHT to (8,7)** - This is the ONLY safe move! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**WHY THIS IS PERFECT:**\n1. **We're eating an apple!** (8,7) is an apple - we grow to 19 apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **We're maintaining our blocking position!** From (8,7), we're still cutting off any escape to the right side. Snake #1 at (2,6) is trying to drop down, but our body at (6,6) and below is blocking their downward escape.\n3. **We control the entire right quadrant!** From (8,7), we can chase them down if needed. They're trapped between our body on the left and the right wall.\n4. **Apple access!** We're positioned near apples at (8,9), (9,7), (9,5), etc. - perfect for future growth.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Snake #1 is panicking! They're at (2,6) trying to find space, but they're running out of room. Our body forms a wall from (6,6) down to (0,2), blocking their downward escape. They'll have to go LEFT to (1,6) or RIGHT to (3,6), but RIGHT is risky because it brings them closer to our body line. Eventually, they'll be forced into the top-left corner where they'll crash. Meanwhile, we keep growing and controlling the board. Let's close this out! \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",

Let's analyze the board.\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (BOARD STATE UPDATE):**\n- **My head at (9,7)** - At the RIGHT boundary! Body stretches left to (8,7) then down and left to (0,2). We're locked in on the right side.\n- **Snake #1 at (1,5)** - They're still at (1,5) from last turn? Wait, their body shows (2,5) as the first after head... Actually from board state: \"5 T 1 T . T . . A A A\" - that's row 5. At index 1 (x=1) we see '1' which is their head! So they're at (1,5) indeed.\n- **Strategic position**: We're at (9,7) - the absolute right edge. From here, only LEFT, UP, or DOWN are viable. RIGHT would be off-board and kill us.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **UP to (9,8)**: Row 8 shows \" . T T T T T . A . .\" - index 9 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE\n- **DOWN to (9,6)**: Row 6 shows \"T T T T T T T . . A\" - index 9 is 'A' (apple!) \u2705 SAFE  \n- **LEFT to (8,7)**: Row 7 shows \". T T T A T T T 0 A\" - index 8 is 'T' (our own body)! DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (10,7)**: Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**THE PLAY:** We have TWO safe moves: UP to (9,8) or DOWN to (9,6). \n\n**WHICH TO CHOOSE?**\n- **DOWN to (9,6)**: This is an APPLE! We'd grow to 21 apples, extending our lead to 21-15. However... looking at row 6: \"T T T T T T T . . A\" - there's an apple at (9,6) but the cells to our left (8,6) and (7,6) are empty ('.'). But wait, our body is at (8,7) above and (8,6) is actually empty? Let me check board state carefully...\n\nActually looking at board state for row 7: \" . T T T A T T T 0 A\" - this shows position 8 is 'T' (our body) and position 9 is 'A'. But our head is at (9,7), so (8,7) is our body. For row 6: \"T T T T T T T . . A\" - positions 0-6 are 'T', 7-8 are '.', 9 is 'A'. So (9,6) is apple, (8,6) is empty, (7,6) is empty.\n\nBut if we go DOWN to (9,6), we'd be eating an apple but moving our head to (9,6). Our body would shift: current head (9,7) becomes part of body, old body shifts. But we need to check if moving to (9,6) would cause any collision in the future...\n\nActually, let's think about the ENEMY. Snake #1 is at (1,5). They might move RIGHT to (2,5), UP to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4), or LEFT to (0,5). They're trying to survive and get apples. They're not an immediate threat to us.\n\nBut we need to think about BOARD CONTROL. If we go DOWN to (9,6), we're at the bottom-right corner area. If we go UP to (9,8), we're moving toward the top-right corner. \n\nLooking at available apples: (9,6) is RIGHT THERE - we can eat it immediately. (9,8) is empty but there's an apple at (8,9) and (7,8) etc. \n\nThe RISK with DOWN: If we eat (9,6), we grow, but then our body will extend. We need to see if we can continue moving DOWN or LEFT afterward. From (9,6), possible next moves: UP back to (9,7) (but that will be our body by then), LEFT to (8,6) (empty), DOWN to (9,5) (but row 5 shows \"... T . . A A A\" - at x=9, row 5 is 'A'? Let's check row 5: \"5 T 1 T . T . . A A A\" - positions: 0:T, 1:1, 2:T, 3:., 4:T, 5:., 6:., 7:A, 8:A, 9:A. So (9,5) is 'A' - apple! So from (9,6) we could go DOWN to (9,5) for another apple!\n\nThe RISK with UP: From (9,8), we can go UP to (9,9) which is... row 9: \"9 . . . . T T A . A .\" - at x=9, it's '.' (empty). Or LEFT to (8,8) which is 'T' (our body? wait no, row 8: \"8 . T T T T T . A . .\" - at x=8 it's 'T'? Actually positions: 0:., 1:T, 2:T, 3:T, 4:T, 5:T, 6:., 7:A, 8:., 9:. So (8,8) is '.' (empty). So (9,8) to (8,8) is safe.\n\nBut we want to DOMINATE. Eating apples is key. We have 20, they have 15. We need 10 more to win. The apple at (9,6) is RIGHT THERE. Let's take it and extend our lead!\n\n**DECISION:** Go DOWN to (9,6) to eat the apple and grow to 21 apples. Then from there, we can continue moving DOWN to (9,5) for another apple, or LEFT to explore. This keeps us on the right edge where we're safe from the enemy.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Chain apple-eating on the right edge! Move DOWN to (9,6) \u2192 (9,5) \u2192 possibly (9,4) etc., growing our lead while the enemy scrambles in the left side. Keep the body forming a wall. Once we hit 30 apples, we win. Let's go!\n\nDOWN",

Do NOT head-on them unless we have a clear apples advantage; right now they lead 20\u219215, so we should keep chipping and boxing.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns (so we can reference this as our last rationale next clip):\n- Take (1,4) now (DOWN), then move toward (1,2) apple, hugging column 1 to limit their lateral space.\n- Keep options open: after securing those apples, spiral back up if they approach, forcing them into tighter lanes.

Let's analyze this new board state.\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\n- **My head at (9,6)** - We just moved DOWN from (9,7) to eat the apple! Now at the bottom-right corner. Body stretches all the way left to (0,2).\n- **Snake #1 at (1,4)** - They moved DOWN from (1,5) to (1,4)! Interesting - they're going deeper into the left side.\n- **Strategic position**: We're at (9,6) - corner position. Only LEFT and UP are viable. RIGHT is off-board, DOWN would be (9,5) which shows \"A\" (apple!) but wait, we need to check if it's actually safe first.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **UP to (9,7)**: Row 7 shows \" . T T T A T T T T T\" - index 9 is 'T' (our own body)! DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (8,6)**: Row 6 shows \"T T T T T T T . . A\" - index 8 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE\n- **RIGHT to (10,6)**: Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (9,5)**: Row 5 shows \"T T T . T . . A A A\" - index 9 is 'A' (apple!) \u2705 SAFE\n\n**WAIT!** UP is actually DEAD because (9,7) is now our body! So we have TWO safe moves: LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5) with an apple!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nDOWN to (9,5) gets us ANOTHER APPLE! That would be our 22nd apple, extending our lead to 22-16! The board shows (9,5) is 'A' in row 5. From (9,5), we could continue DOWN to (9,4) which is 'T' (enemy body? Let's check row 4: \"4 T 1 . T T A . A . .\" - index 9 is '.'). Actually (9,4) is empty! So we could chain more moves DOWN.\n\nBut wait, if we go DOWN to (9,5) and eat that apple, we grow. The enemy is at (1,4) moving around. They're not an immediate threat on the right side.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- DOWN to (9,5): Apple! Safe. Future moves: LEFT to (8,5) (empty), DOWN to (9,4) (empty), UP to (9,6) (our body after moving).\n- LEFT to (8,6): Empty. Future moves: LEFT to (7,6) (empty), UP to (8,7) (our body), DOWN to (8,5) (empty), RIGHT to (9,6) (our body after moving).\n\nBOTH keep options open, but DOWN gets us immediate CONTENT and points! We're 21-16, need to extend lead. The apple is RIGHT THERE. Let's take it!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Chain DOWN moves along the right edge: (9,6) \u2192 (9,5) \u2192 (9,4) \u2192 (9,3) etc. Check each turn for safety. This will grow our body as a wall on the right while enemy is stuck on left. Once we hit 30, game over.\n\nDOWN",

Very tight. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3) = empty and safe. From (1,3) we keep TWO good follow-ups (DOWN to apple at 1,2 or RIGHT to 2,3). Keeps options open and stays in column 1 to compress the enemy. \u2705\n\nTactical read:\n- Opponent (#0) is long, up/right at (9,6) with lots of body on the top/left \u2014 they lead 21\u219216. We do NOT want a head-on unless we have the apple lead. So we should avoid risky single-option moves that could get us boxed or force a collision.\n- Going RIGHT narrows our escape routes and risks getting trapped by their long body or our own body. Going DOWN keeps us alive, gives immediate access to (1,2) apple next turn, and helps us hug column 1 to squeeze them later.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 this will be our next rationale):\n- Move DOWN now to (1,3). Next turn push DOWN to take (1,2) apple if safe; if opponent approaches from above, pivot RIGHT into open row 3 to stay mobile. Keep hugging column 1\u20132 to limit their lateral space and force them into their own tail or the wall. Only force head-on if we can close the apple gap.\n\nMake the safe, aggressive play \u2014 keep options open and box them in.\n\nDOWN",

DEAD! \u274c  \n  - **RIGHT to (10,5)**: Off board! DEAD! \u274c  \n  - **DOWN to (9,4)**: Row 4 shows \"T 1 . T T A . A . .\" - index 9 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE  \n  - **LEFT to (8,5)**: Row 5 shows \"T T T . T . . A A\" - index 8 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE  \n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**  \nDOWN to (9,4) is safe. LEFT to (8,5) is safe. UP and RIGHT are death.  \n\n**STRATEGIC\u8003\u91cf:**  \n- **DOWN to (9,4)**: Continue along the right edge, staying near corner. From there, possible future moves: DOWN to (9,3) (row 3 index 9 is 'A' - apple!), LEFT to (8,4) (row 4 index 8 is '.'). This keeps us moving toward apples on the right side.  \n- **LEFT to (8,5)**: Moves us toward the center. Future options: DOWN to (8,4) (empty), LEFT to (7,5) (row 5 index 7 is 'A' - apple!). But we'd be moving closer to enemy territory on the left.  \n\n**AGGRESSION & BOARD DOMINATION:**  \nWe're leading 22-16. Enemy is on the left. We want to claim the right side as our domain. Continuing DOWN along the right edge creates a wall that boxes them in. They're at (1,3) - far away. No immediate collision risk.  \n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITY:**  \nCheck apple list: (9,3) is an apple! If we go DOWN to (9,4), next turn we could go DOWN again to (9,3) and eat! That would be our 23rd apple, extending lead to 23-16.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- DOWN keeps us in corner, safe from enemy.  \n- LEFT moves us to (8,5) - open space but might expose us later.  \n\n**VERDICT:**  \nTake DOWN to (9,4) \u2192 set up for eating apple at (9,3) next turn. This chains right-edge movement, grows our wall, and keeps enemy confined to left side. We're playing the long game!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nChain right-edge moves: (9,4) \u2192 (9,3) [apple!] \u2192 (9,2) \u2192 etc. Keep building our fortress while enemy wanders left. Once we hit 30, we win.  \n\nDOWN  \n**END RATIONALE**",

High risk of getting funneled. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,2) = apple \u2014 safe, immediate growth, keeps options open (can follow to 2,2 or swing back into row 3 later). \u2705\n\nTactical read:\n- Opponent (#0) is far on the right/top and leads on apples (22\u219216). We should NOT seek a head-on; we need apples and mobility to box them, not a suicide duel.\n- Grabbing the apple at (1,2) grows us to 17 and tightens our control of columns 1\u20132 so we can start compressing their space later. This preserves multiple follow-ups and avoids forcing a head-on.\n\nShort-term plan (for your next rationale / next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Take (1,2) now. Then go for (2,2) if safe to keep growing and expand along row 2.\n- After that, pivot to slowly fence the opponent by hugging columns 1\u20133 and cutting access to the left wall \u2014 trap their tail and force them into their own body or a risky head-on when we have apples > them.\n- Avoid any single-option moves that let them pick a safe escape; keep 2+ exits when possible.\n\nLet\u2019s cash this apple and keep the pressure.

Now we're at the bottom-right corner, ready to keep the pressure on!\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **My head at (9,3)** - Just moved DOWN from (9,4). Body stretches from (9,4) down to (0,2).\n- **Snake #1 at (2,2)** - Still near the left side, probably moving around trying to catch up.\n- **Board state**: We're at (9,3) - bottom-right corner! Let's check moves:\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **UP to (9,4)**: Our own body! DEAD! \u274c (just came from there)\n- **RIGHT to (10,3)**: Off board! DEAD! \u274c  \n- **DOWN to (9,2)**: Row 2 shows \". T 1 T T T . . . .\" - index 9 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE\n- **LEFT to (8,3)**: Row 3 shows \"T T . T A . . . . A\" - index 8 is '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are safe! But which is better? \n\n**DOWN to (9,2)**:\n- Keeps us on the right edge, boxing in Snake #1 to the left\n- From (9,2), we can go LEFT to (8,2) (empty), or BACK UP to (9,3) (safe after we move)\n- Good positioning to control the right side\n\n**LEFT to (8,3)**:\n- Moves us inward slightly, giving more breathing room\n- From (8,3), we have multiple options: UP (8,4), DOWN (8,2), LEFT (7,3)\n- But we're leaving the edge and giving Snake #1 more space to maneuver\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm going **DOWN to (9,2)**! Why? Because:\n1. **Edge dominance**: Staying on the right edge keeps Snake #1 confined to the left side. The longer we maintain this, the more we box them in.\n2. **No immediate risk**: Enemy is far away at (2,2) - no collision threat.\n3. **Future flexibility**: From (9,2) we can still maneuver leftwards if needed, but we keep our territorial advantage.\n4. **Psychological edge**: Staying on the edge looks clean and calculated - we're in control!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nContinue edge-hugging strategy! From (9,2) \u2192 (9,1) \u2192 (8,1) \u2192 etc. Keep Snake #1 trapped on the left side while we collect apples on the right. When we hit 30+ apples, victory is ours! We're playing the long game - patience and positioning!\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Risk of getting boxed. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,1): apple right now (instant +1), plus after eating we\u2019ll have multiple follow-up exits (left/right/down) and won\u2019t be stuck. Best mix of scoring and mobility. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n\n3) Tactical read:\n- We\u2019re down 5 apples (23 vs 18). We need growth and territory control \u2014 apples are the fastest way to close the gap.\n- Opponent #0 is clustered on the right/top; they can\u2019t threaten our immediate apple chain this turn. No head-on risk this move.\n- Taking (2,1) gives immediate points and preserves options to pivot into columns 1\u20133 to start boxing toward the center while avoiding their heavy right-side presence.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20135 turns):\n- Grab (2,1) now to start chaining apples and trim the score deficit.\n- Use the added length to pressure columns 1\u20133, corral space, and only force a head-on if we\u2019ve overtaken them on apples.\n- Stay out of the thin corridor above (2,3)/(2,4) unless it becomes a guaranteed safe apple chain \u2014 don\u2019t get funneled into a trap.\n\nWe take the apple, keep options open, and stay aggressive.

Nice!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **UP to (9,3)**: Our own body! (We just left there) \u274c DEAD\n- **RIGHT to (10,2)**: Off board! \u274c DEAD\n- **DOWN to (9,1)**: Row 1 shows \". . 1 A .

Why?\n1. **EDGE DOMINANCE**: Keep that right edge locked down! Snake #1 is stuck on the left - we're controlling half the board!\n2. **FUTURE MOVES**: From (9,1) we can still move LEFT (8,1) if needed, or loop around\n3. **NO RISKS**: Enemy is at (2,1) - they're moving left, away from us. No head-on collision threat!\n4. **PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE**: We look unshakable on that edge - the chat LOVES this!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MYSELF):**\nContinue the edge-hug! (9,1) \u2192 (8,1) \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 etc. Keep Snake #1 trapped in the left quadrant while we methodically sweep. When we hit 30 apples, it's GG! We're playing chess, not checkers!\n\nDOWN",

After eating, we can pivot to (4,0) or (2,0) and then climb back into midboard to contest apples while avoiding the opponent\u2019s wall.\n- DOWN keeps multiple follow-ups open and avoids getting funneled by their long body on the right. Aggro + safety = growth first, then squeeze.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20135 turns):\n1) Take (3,0) now (DOWN) \u2014 instant apple, grow, +1 score.\n2) From there, push along y=0 (\u2192 or \u2190) to free space, then fold up into cols 3\u20135 to pressure interior apples while staying out of their U-shaped trap on the top-right.\n3) If we out-apple them later, start forcing head-on attempts; until then, avoid simultaneous head collisions.\n\nTime to snatch the apple and swing momentum.

Time to keep the pressure ON and box that snake in! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n- **My head at (9,0)** - We just moved DOWN from (9,1) and GRABBED THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Snake #1 at (3,0)** - They moved DOWN to (3,0) from (3,1) - They're now at the bottom-left corner! \ud83d\udc40\n- **Apple at (8,0)** is right next to us - we can grab it next turn if we survive!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK (THIS TURN):**\n- **UP to (9,1)**: Row 1 shows \". . T 1 . T . . . 0\" - index 9 is '0' (our own body)! \u274c DEAD (backwards into self)\n- **RIGHT to (10,0)**: Off board! \u274c DEAD\n- **DOWN to (9,-1)**: Off board! \u274c DEAD\n- **LEFT to (8,0)**: Row 0 shows \"A . . 1 . . . .

This is actually PERFECT for us! \n\n**THE PLAY: I'm going LEFT to (8,0)!** Why?\n1. **STILL GRABBING APPLES NEXT TURN**: From (8,0), we can grab the apple at (8,0) next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **CORNER DOMINATION**: We're sweeping the bottom edge LEFT\u2192RIGHT! Snake #1 is stuck at (3,0) in the bottom-left corner - we OWN the bottom-right!\n3. **ENEMY THREAT**: They're at (3,0) - they have NO moves but UP to (3,1) or RIGHT to (4,0). Either way, they're moving AWAY from us!\n4. **NO TRAPS**: From (8,0), we can go LEFT to (7,0) or UP to (8,1) next turn - we're keeping options OPEN!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MYSELF):**\nFrom (8,0) \u2192 LEFT to (7,0) \u2192 LEFT to (6,0) \u2192 etc. Keep sweeping the bottom edge while Snake #1 panics in the left side.

Illegal. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,-1) = off-board.

More apples faster = we close the 3-apple gap.\n- Keeps multiple follow-ups open (continue east for bottom apples, or fold up into midboard around x=4\u20136). Avoids getting boxed into the left column.\n- No head-on risk this turn \u2014 opponent is too far to contest our immediate destination.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20135 turns):\n1) Take (4,0) now to open the bottom corridor.\n2) Sprint to (6,0) to nab a quick apple and grow \u2014 score-pressure play.\n3) After grabbing bottom apples, pivot into the midboard (x\u22484\u20136) to contest nearby apples while avoiding direct head-on fights until we have the lead. If we get ahead, start forcing head collisions.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure, grab apples, and choke their options. We\u2019re coming for that lead.

If we go LEFT, we're moving TOWARD them to corner them in! \ud83c\udfaf\n2. **APPLE CONTROL**: There's an apple at (7,5), (7,4), (7,8) - from (7,0) we have better access to those vertical apples while keeping the bottom edge controlled!\n3. **TRAPPING STRATEGY**: By going LEFT to (7,0), we're setting up a box formation! Their escape routes are getting limited! They're in a 3x3 box at (0-3, 0-2) while we control the RIGHT side!\n4. **FUTURE MOVES**: From (7,0), we can still go LEFT to (6,0) or UP to (8,1) - keeping options OPEN!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're sweeping the bottom edge LEFT\u2192RIGHT while Snake #1 panics in the left corner.

Dead. \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,0) = our neck. Backwards. Dead. \u274c  \n- UP \u2192 (4,1) = empty now, but note (4,2) and (3,1) are our body \u2014 that leaves only one good follow-up (5,1) if we go up. Risk: funnels us into a single escape route. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,0) = empty, legal, and keeps two safe follow-ups next turn (RIGHT\u2192(6,0) apple OR UP\u2192(5,1)). More breathing room. \u2705\n\nTactical read \u2014 be smart, be ruthless:\n- Opponent head is at (8,0). They can go LEFT toward the bottom apples, so there\u2019s a two-way race for (6,0). We CANNOT gamble on a head-on clash \u2014 they\u2019re up 25\u219221. If both go into (6,0) same turn we both die and they win. NOPE.  \n- That said, moving RIGHT to (5,0) gives us flexibility: if the opponent commits toward (6,0) and sets up a collision, we can pivot UP to (5,1) next turn to avoid the double KO. If they don\u2019t contest, we can sprint to (6,0) safely when it\u2019s clear. Smart, adaptable aggression. \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20135 turns):\n1) Move RIGHT to (5,0) now to open the bottom corridor and keep options.  \n2) On the next turn, if opponent clearly commits left into (6,0) simultaneously, dodge UP to (5,1). Otherwise take (6,0) yourself.  \n3) After securing bottom apples safely, fold into midboard (x\u22484\u20136) to contest apples and avoid getting boxed on the left. Only force head-on if we actually have the lead. \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe keep options open, avoid a risky head-to-head while trailing, and pressure for quick growth. You ready?

They're trying to close the gap! We need to GAIN HEIGHT to avoid a head-on collision! \ud83d\udea8\n2. **AVOID TRAP**: Going RIGHT to (8,0) puts us back where we just were - no progress! We need to move FORWARD in the plan!\n3. **APPLE ACCESS**: From (7,1), we can access apples at (7,5), (7,4), (7,8) - we're in a perfect column to sweep UP!\n4. **TRAPPING STRATEGY**: By going UP, we're moving parallel to the enemy who's stuck on the bottom row! We maintain control of the right side while they're stuck below!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're going UP along column 7, sweeping the right side!

Good move, staying alive.\n- **Snake #1 at (5,1)** - They moved UP from (5,0) to match us! We're now ALIGNED! Same y-coordinate, just 2 cells apart! This could be a trap or an opportunity... \ud83d\udea8\n- **Our score: 25 vs 21** - We're ahead by 4! But the win condition is 30 apples OR the end of 150 turns. We need 5 more apples to reach 30!\n- **Board control:** We're in column 7, they're in column 5. We still own the right side!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK (THIS TURN):**\n\n**UP to (7,2):**\n- Look at the board: Row 2 shows \". T T T . . . . . T\" - Index 7 is '.' (empty)! \u2705 SAFE\n- Is it a trap? Let's see... Enemy head at (5,1) could potentially move UP to (5,2) or RIGHT to (6,1)...\n\n**DOWN to (7,0):**\n- Row 0 shows \"A . . T T T A T T T\" - Index 7 is 'T' (our own tail)! \u274c DEAD (would hit our own body)\n- Also, we just came from there! Moving back is dangerous.\n\n**LEFT to (6,1):**\n- Row 1 shows \". . T T . 1 . 0 . T\" - Index 6 is '0' (wait, that's our head at index 7, so index 6 is '.' actually! Let me check...\n- Actually, the board shows: index 6 is '.' (empty), but Snake #1's body is at (6,0) and (5,0), etc. However, we're moving into (6,1) which is currently empty... BUT wait, Snake #1's head is at (5,1). If they move RIGHT to (6,1) AND we move LEFT to (6,1), we'd have a HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both snakes die! That's a double KO!\n\n**RIGHT to (8,1):**\n- Row 1: Index 8 is 'T' (our own body)! Wait, let me check our body list... We have (9,1) in our body, but (8,1) should be empty based on the board? Actually, looking at the board: \". . T T . 1 . 0 . T\" - index 8 is '.'! \u2705 SAFE\n- Our body: (7,1) current head, (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1)... so (8,1) is NOT in our body! It's clear!\n\n**ANALYSIS OF LEFT MOVE (6,1):**\nThis is the DANGER ZONE. Snake #1's head is at (5,1). If they move RIGHT to (6,1) and we move LEFT to (6,1), it's a DOUBLE KO. Even though we'd win on score (25 vs 21) if we both die, but the game could end with both of us dead. However, if Snake #1 is smart, they might avoid this collision since we have the higher score and they'd lose. But if they're desperate... \n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nI have THREE safe moves: UP, RIGHT, and LEFT (with collision risk). DOWN kills me.\n\n**THE PLAY: I'm going RIGHT to (8,1)!**\n\nWhy RIGHT over UP?\n1. **AVOID THE COLLISION ZONE:** Going LEFT to (6,1) is too risky with Snake #1 right next door. If they move RIGHT, we both die! Not worth it when we're ahead!\n2. **AVOID THE TRAP:** Going UP to (7,2) is also risky because Snake #1 at (5,1) could move RIGHT to (6,1) and then on the next turn, they could trap us! The board shows there's an apple at (8,4) in our column, but we need to think long-term!\n3. **EXTEND OUR REACH:** Going RIGHT to (8,1) gives us access to the rightmost column! We can move DOWN to (8,0) (empty), RIGHT to (9,1) (empty), or UP to (8,2) (need to check). This opens more options!\n4. **MAINTAIN DISTANCE:** Keeping distance from Snake #1 is key! We're already ahead on score. If we can survive and keep them trapped, we win by default or by reaching 30!\n5. **APPLE ACCESS:** From (8,1), we're closer to the apple at (8,4) and (8,5)! We can sweep that column!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\n- We're going RIGHT to claim the rightmost column!\n- From there, we can move UP along column 8-9, sweeping apples while Snake #1 is stuck in the left-center!\n- We have 25 apples, they have 21. We need 5 more. We can do this!\n- Keep distance, avoid head-on collisions, and force them into a corner!\n\n**LET'S GOOOO CHAT! RIGHT!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Good move, claiming the edge.\n- **Snake #1 at (5,2)** - They moved UP from (5,1) to (5,2)! Still in the left-center.\n- **Our score: 25 vs 21** - We're ahead by 4! We need 5 more apples to reach 30!\n- **Board control:** We're in column 8, they're in column 5. We still own the right side!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK (THIS TURN):**\n\n**UP to (8,2):**\n- Looking at the board: Row 2 shows \". T T . . 1 . . . T\" - Index 8 is '.' (empty)! \u2705 SAFE\n- Check for enemy heads: Snake #1 at (5,2) is far away. No immediate collision risk.\n\n**DOWN to (8,0):**\n- Row 0 shows \"A . . T T T A T T T\" - Index 8 is 'T' (our own body)! \u274c DEAD (would hit our own body)\n- Actually wait, let's check our body list... Our body is: [(7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7)]\n- Yes, (8,0) IS in our body! Moving DOWN would kill us!\n\n**LEFT to (7,1):**\n- Row 1 shows \". . T T . T . T 0 T\" - Index 7 is 'T' (our own body)! \u274c DEAD\n- Also, we just came from (7,1) - that's our previous head position. Moving BACKWARDS into our own body is illegal!\n\n**RIGHT to (9,1):**\n- Row 1: Index 9 is 'T' (our own body)! Wait, let me check... Our body includes (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), etc. Yes, (9,1) IS in our body! \u274c DEAD\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nWait, hold up! Let me double-check the board state...\n\nLooking at the board again:\n```\n9 A . . . T T A . A .\n8 . T T T T T A A . .\n7 . T T T A T T T T T\n6 . . T T T T T . . T\n5 . T T . T . . A A T\n4 .

T T T A T T T\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head is at (8,1) - that's the '0' in row 1, column 8.\nMy body should be marked as 'T'.\n\nLet me trace my body from the list:\n(8,1) - HEAD\n(7,1) - T\n(7,0) - T\n(8,0) - T\n(9,0) - T\n(9,1) - T\n(9,2) - T\n(9,3) - T\n(9,4) - T\n(9,5) - T\n(9,6) - T\n(9,7) - T\n(8,7) - T\n(7,7) - T\n(6,7) - T\n(6,6) - T\n(5,6) - T\n(5,7) - T\n(5,8) - T\n(5,9) - T\n(4,9) - T\n(4,8) - T\n(3,8) - T\n(2,8) - T\n(1,8) - T\n(1,7) - T\n\nSo checking the possible moves from (8,1):\n\n**UP (8,2):** The board shows row 2, column 8 is '.' (empty). Is (8,2) in my body? No! \u2705 SAFE\n\n**DOWN (8,0):** The board shows row 0, column 8 is 'T'. And (8,0) IS in my body! \u274c DEAD\n\n**LEFT (7,1):** The board shows row 1, column 7 is 'T'. And (7,1) IS in my body (first after head)! \u274c DEAD\n\n**RIGHT (9,1):** The board shows row 1, column 9 is 'T'. And (9,1) IS in my body! \u274c DEAD\n\n**WAIT A MINUTE!** Only UP is safe?! That can't be right...\n\nLet me re-examine... Actually, looking at the board more carefully:\n\nRow 1: \". . T T . T . T 0 T\"\nIndex: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\n\nSo:\n- (7,1): Index 7 = 'T' - that's my body\n- (8,1): Index 8 = '0' - that's my HEAD\n- (9,1): Index 9 = 'T' - that's my body\n\nSo indeed:\n- DOWN to (8,0): Row 0, index 8 = 'T' - my body\n- LEFT to (7,1): Row 1, index 7 = 'T' - my body  \n- RIGHT to (9,1): Row 1, index 9 = 'T' - my body\n- UP to (8,2): Row 2, index 8 = '.' - EMPTY!\n\n**THIS IS A TRAP!** I'm boxed in! The only safe move is UP!\n\n**DECISION:**\nI have NO CHOICE but to go UP to (8,2). It's literally the only move that won't kill me immediately. \n\n**BUT WAIT!** Let me think about what Snake #1 might do...\n\nSnake #1 is at (5,2) with body: [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n- UP to (5,3): Row 3 shows \". T . T A . . . . T\" - Index 5 is 'T' (their own body)! Actually wait, row 3: \". T . T A . . . . T\" - index 5 is '.' (empty). But is (5,3) in their body? Let me check... Their body includes (5,1), (5,0)... no (5,3). So UP is possible for them.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Row 1 shows \". . T T . T . T 0 T\" - Index 5 is 'T' (their own body)! Yes, (5,1) is in their body. So DOWN would kill them.\n- LEFT to (4,2): Row 2 shows \". T T . . 1 . . . T\" - Index 4 is '.' (empty). Is (4,2) in their body? No. So LEFT is possible.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): Row 2, index 6 is '.' (empty). Is (6,2) in their body? No. So RIGHT is possible.\n\nSo Snake #1 has three safe moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nIf I go UP to (8,2):\n- If Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (6,2): No collision, we're fine.\n- If Snake #1 goes UP to (5,3): No collision, we're fine.\n- If Snake #1 goes LEFT to (4,2): No collision, we're fine.\n\nThe only danger is if Snake #1 somehow moves to (8,2) simultaneously, but that's impossible since they're at (5,2) - they'd need to move RIGHT 3 cells, which isn't possible.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nI'm cornered! After going UP to (8,2), where can I go next?\n- From (8,2), I could potentially go UP to (8,3), LEFT to (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,2)\n- Let me check (8,3): Row 3, index 8 = '.' (empty) - could be safe\n- (7,2): Row 2, index 7 = '.' (empty) - could be safe\n- (9,2): Row 2, index 9 = 'T' (my body) - would kill me\n\n**THIS IS DANGEROUS!** I need to plan my escape from this corner!\n\n**IMMEDIATE PLAN:**\n1. **GO UP to (8,2)** - it's the ONLY safe move this turn\n2. From there, I need to assess if I can break out of this corner\n3. I'm trapped on the right edge with my body blocking my escape routes\n\n**WAIT!** Let me look at the apples on the board:\n- (7,5) - row 5, col 7\n- (8,9) - row 9, col 8\n- (7,4) - row 4, col 7\n- (6,9) - row 9, col 6\n- (7,8) - row 8, col 7\n- (8,5) - row 5, col 8\n- (4,7) - row 7, col 4\n- (5,4) - row 4, col 5\n- (4,3) - row 3, col 4\n- (2,4) - row 4, col 2\n- (8,4) - row 4, col 8\n- (0,0) - row 0, col 0\n- (6,8) - row 8, col 6\n- (6,0) - row 0, col 6\n- (0,9) - row 9, col 0\n\nI see an apple at (8,4)! That's only 2 cells UP from my current position (8,1) if I go to (8,2) then (8,3) then (8,4). But wait, is (8,3) safe?\n\nLooking at row 3: \". T . T A . . . . T\" - index 8 is '.' (empty). So (8,3) is empty! And (8,4) has an apple marked as 'A' in row 4, index 8.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nGo UP to (8,2) now, then next turn go UP to (8,3), then UP to (8,4) to eat the apple! That would give me my 26th apple, getting me closer to 30!\n\nBut I need to make sure (8,2) is truly safe... Let me double-check if (8,2) is in my body. My body list doesn't include (8,2). The board shows (8,2) is '.' - empty. Yes, it's safe!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nI have no choice - UP is the only move that keeps me alive. Even though it puts me in a slightly more confined position, it's better than dying immediately. From (8,2), I can potentially move toward that apple at (8,4) or find another way out.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO CHAT! UP!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Also, the opponent\u2019s only legal move this tick is UP (to 8,2), so we don\u2019t need to lean into them right now. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- UP \u2192 (5,3) is empty, gives multiple follow-ups (UP into open space or left/right to apples), preserves wiggle room, and avoids risky confrontation this tick. \u2705\n\nWhy UP? Keep it simple: we can\u2019t win if we\u2019re dead.

We need 5 more to hit 30!\n- **Enemy is getting closer** - They're at column 5, we're at column 8. Still have space!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n\n**UP to (8, 3):**\n- Row 3: \". T . T A . . . . T\" - Index 8 is '.' (empty)! \u2705 SAFE\n- Enemy at (5, 3) - no collision risk. They might move away!\n\n**DOWN to (8, 1):**\n- That's where we just came from! That's moving BACKWARDS into our own body! \u274c DEAD\n\n**LEFT to (7, 2):**\n- Row 2: \". T T . . 1 . . . T\" - Index 7 is '.' (empty)! \u2705 SAFE\n- Is (7, 2) in my body? Let me check... No! \u2705 SAFE\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n- Row 2: Index 9 is 'T' - that's our body! \u274c DEAD\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n**UP to (8, 3):**\n- Moves us CLOSER to apple at (8, 4) - only 1 cell away!\n- Keeps us on the right edge where we control space\n- From (8, 3), we could potentially move RIGHT to (9, 3) or LEFT to (7, 3) next turn\n- **BUT WAIT!** Looking at row 3, index 9 is 'T' (our body), so RIGHT is blocked!\n- From (8, 3), we could go UP to (8, 4) for the apple, or LEFT to (7, 3)\n- (7, 3): Row 3, index 7 is '.' (empty) - could be safe!\n\n**LEFT to (7, 2):**\n- Moves us AWAY from the apple at (8, 4)\n- Gets us off the edge and into more open space\n- From (7, 2), we could go UP to (7, 3), LEFT to (6, 2), or DOWN to (7, 1) [but (7, 1) is our body!]\n- (6, 2): Row 2, index 6 is '.' (empty) - safe!\n- (7, 3): Row 3, index 7 is '.' (empty) - safe!\n\n**THE DECISION:**\n\nI have TWO safe moves: UP or LEFT. Which is better?\n\n**Going UP to (8, 3)** puts us 1 cell away from an apple at (8, 4), but we might get trapped if we can't move LEFT or RIGHT from there. However, we DO have LEFT option to (7, 3) if needed.\n\n**Going LEFT to (7, 2)** gives us MORE escape options and gets us off the tight edge, but we lose immediate access to the apple at (8, 4).\n\n**BUT HERE'S THE KEY:** Snake #1 is at (5, 3) now. If they move UP to (5, 4), they'd be at (5, 4) which is RIGHT next to the apple at (4, 7)... but wait, that's not immediate danger.\n\nActually, looking at the bigger picture: **I need to eat apples to win!** The apple at (8, 4) is SO CLOSE and I can probably reach it next turn if I go UP now.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nIf I go UP to (8, 3):\n- Next turn I can go UP to (8, 4) and eat the apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From (8, 4), I could potentially move LEFT to (7, 4) (which has an apple too!) or UP to (8, 5)\n- This sets up a potential double-apple play!\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 2):\n- I'm playing it safe but losing immediate apple access\n- Snake #1 might take that apple instead!\n\n**THE PLAY:** GO UP! Take the space, chase the apple, get that bread! Even if it's slightly riskier, we need points to close this out!\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT! UP AND GET THE APPLE!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

Instant death. NOPE. \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,3) is an apple and open, but it hugs our body on the left and only leaves ~2 safe follow-ups. Risky for trapping ourselves. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- UP \u2192 (5,4) is open and safe, with 2 follow-ups (UP, RIGHT). Solid for space control but a bit passive. \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,3) is open and gives the most wiggle room (UP, RIGHT, DOWN available next). It pushes pressure toward the rival while keeping escape routes. \u2705\u2705\n\nWhy I pick RIGHT: we\u2019re down on apples (21 vs 25), so we absolutely DO NOT want to force a head-on. We need mobility and options to bait them into tight turns near the right wall. RIGHT moves us toward the fight without cornering ourselves \u2014 maximum follow-up choices, puts us in a position to pressure their flank, and lets us pivot out if they try to run or bait a collision.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n1) Keep approaching their left flank while avoiding committing to simultaneous head moves.  \n2) Use our mobility to steer them toward the congested right wall and their own body.  \n3) Only lock into a head-on if we have an apple advantage or a guaranteed double-die that favors us; otherwise keep the squeeze and grow safely.  \n4) Watch their next move for whether they go UP or LEFT; adjust to cut off escape lanes without sacrificing our own exits.\n\nRIGHT",

We need 5 more to hit 30!\n- **DANGER ALERT:** Snake #1 is now at (6, 3) - that's only 2 cells to our LEFT at (8, 3)!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n\n**UP to (8, 4):**\n- Row 4: \". T A . T A . A A T\" - Index 8 is 'A' - an apple! \u2705 SAFE\n- Enemy at (6, 3) - not moving into our body! \u2705 SAFE\n- **BUT WAIT!** Could Snake #1 move RIGHT to (7, 3) and then to (8, 3) next turn? No, they'd need TWO moves. But if THEY move UP to (6, 4) now... \n- (6, 4): Row 4, index 6 is '.' (empty) - they could safely go there!\n\n**DOWN to (8, 2):**\n- That's where we just came from! Backwards into our own body! \u274c DEAD\n\n**LEFT to (7, 3):**\n- Row 3: \". T . T A . . . . T\" - Index 7 is '.' (empty)! \u2705 SAFE\n- **CRITICAL:** If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (7, 3) at the SAME TIME as we move LEFT to (7, 3), **WE BOTH DIE!** HEAD-ON COLLISION!\n- (7, 3) is empty NOW, but Snake #1 could choose RIGHT. Risky!\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n- Row 3: Index 9 is 'T' - that's our body! \u274c DEAD\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n**UP to (8, 4):**\n- **GOAL MET:** Moves onto apple at (8, 4)! +1 point, +1 length! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From there, I'd have options: LEFT to (7, 4) [which also has an apple!], UP to (8, 5), or RIGHT to (9, 4) [but (9, 4) is our body!]\n- **DANGER:** If Snake #1 moves UP to (6, 4) and I move UP to (8, 4), we're safe! BUT if they move RIGHT to (7, 3) and I'm at (8, 4), no collision!\n\n**LEFT to (7, 3):**\n- **AVOID COLLISION RISK:** This is the MAJOR concern! Snake #1 at (6, 3) could easily move RIGHT to (7, 3) this turn. If we BOTH go there, **GAME OVER!** \ud83e\udd15\n- From (7, 3), I could go UP to (7, 4) [apple!], LEFT to (6, 3) [but that's where Snake #1 IS - if they move away, it's safe!], or DOWN to (7, 2)\n- **RISK VS REWARD:** Is it worth the potential head-on collision to get to (7, 3)? NO!\n\n**THE DECISION:**\n\nSnake #1 is RIGHT NEXT to us at (6, 3). They're close enough to threaten a head-on collision if we move LEFT. They could easily choose RIGHT this turn.\n\n**UP is SAFER!** Why?\n1. Moving UP gets us onto an apple - we GROW and score! +1 to our lead!\n2. From (8, 4), we can still move LEFT to (7, 4) next turn (another apple!)\n3. The apple at (8, 4) is GUARANTEED if we move there now - Snake #1 can't reach it this turn\n4. LEFT is too risky with the enemy RIGHT NEXT TO US at (6, 3)!\n\n**ALSO STRATEGIC:** By eating the apple at (8, 4), we move from 25 to 26 apples - we're now only 4 away from winning! Snake #1 would need 9 more to catch up!\n\n**THE PLAY:** GO UP! Eat the apple, extend our lead, and stay away from that enemy head!\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT! UP AND GET THAT BREAD!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

Backwards = instant death. NOPE. \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,3) is open but DANGEROUS: opponent at (8,3) can only go UP or LEFT. If they go LEFT at the same time, we BOTH collide and both die \u2014 they\u2019re up on apples (25 vs 21), so a double KO loses us the match. Too risky. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,2) is legal, but left from there is our body at (5,2) so our follow-up options shrink (only (6,1) and (7,2)). That\u2019s cramped and easier to get boxed. \ud83e\udea4  \n- UP \u2192 (6,4) is legal and gives multiple clean follow-ups ((6,5),(5,4),(7,4)). More wiggle room, more control, fewer head-on temptations. \u2705\u2705\n\nPlaystyle reminder: we are down on apples \u2192 avoid head-ons. We need to BEND the enemy into their own wall/body, not throw ourselves into a mutual death.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Move UP to gain space and approach the opponent from above rather than charging their face.  \n- Use the extra wiggle room to cut off their upward escape if they tries to flee, nudging them into the congested right column and their own body.  \n- Stay flexible \u2014 don\u2019t commit to a head-on unless we close the apple gap and can guarantee the advantage. Grow opportunistically but prioritize survival and trap-building.\n\nLet\u2019s play safe, smart, and savage. UP",

NO WAY. \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4) is an apple but DANGEROUS: opponent head is at (8,4). If they go LEFT and we go RIGHT, we both move into (7,4) \u2192 double KO. They\u2019re ahead on apples (26 \u2192 21). We cannot risk a mutual death. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,4) is legal and safe this turn, gives a couple of follow-ups but tighter space.  \n- UP \u2192 (6,5) is legal, gives the most wiggle room (multiple good follow-ups: (6,6),(5,5),(7,5)), and keeps us out of immediate head-on range.\n\nWhy UP? We\u2019re down on apples \u2014 avoid head-ons unless we can force them. UP increases options and lets us pressure from above, nudging them toward the congested right wall and their own body. It also keeps us flexible to either cut them off later or chase an apple when it\u2019s safe.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Take UP to gain vertical space and avoid a risky RIGHT head-on.  \n- Watch opponent reaction: if they lunge left into (7,4) for the apple, don\u2019t meet them there \u2014 instead continue to box from above or pivot left later when we have advantage.  \n- Prioritize keeping multiple escape routes open; grow only when it helps us corral them, not to bait a double KO.\n\nLet\u2019s stay alive and set up the trap.

But (7,5) is right there...\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Enemy at (6,5) is in a similar situation - they're also trapped on the left side!\n- Their body goes through (6,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6)\n- They're also boxed in on the left!\n\n**THIS IS A STANDOFF!** Neither of us can move freely!\n\n**DECISION:**\nWe're at (8,5). The apple at (7,5) is **RIGHT THERE**. If we don't take it, we might not get another chance. If we take it and die, we lose.\n\nBut we have a **6 apple lead**. If we die to a head-on collision, we tie at 27-21? No wait - if we both die, the one with more apples wins. We have 27, they have 21. We win by 6 apples even if we both die!\n\n**WAIT!** That's not right. Let me check the rules again...\n\n\"If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins. If tied? It's a draw.\"\n\n**YES!** If we both die, we win! We have 27 apples vs their 21!\n\n**BUT HOLD ON...** What if only ONE of us dies? If I die and they live, I lose even with a lead.\n\n**THE BRAIN PLAY:**\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,5):\n- If they go RIGHT to (7,5): **BOTH DIE** \u2192 I win (27 > 21) \u2705\n- If they go UP to (6,6): **I LIVE, get apple, grow to 28** \u2705\n- If they go DOWN to (6,4): **I LIVE, get apple, grow to 28** \u2705\n- If they go LEFT to (5,5): **I LIVE, get apple, grow to 28** \u2705\n\n**ODDS:** 3/4 chance I live AND get apple. 1/4 chance we both die \u2192 I STILL WIN!\n\nIf I go UP to (8,6):\n- I live this turn, but no apple\n- Next turn I'm more trapped\n- They might get the (7,5) apple later!\n\n**THE MATH SAYS: GO FOR THE APPLE!**\n\n**PLUS!** This is CONTENT! Chat wants to see us go for the win, not run scared!\n\n**THE PLAY:** LEFT to (7,5)! Take the apple! Let's see what they do!\n\n**CHAT, ARE YOU READY?!** This is either epic win or epic fail! LET'S GO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

The enemy head is at (5,5), not (6,5). Let me check again...\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:** Head: (5, 5), Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), ...]\n\nSo enemy head is at (5,5), and their body includes (6,5).\n\nFrom MY current position (7,5):\n- **LEFT to (6, 5):** That's enemy BODY (6,5), not head!

A T A T T\"\n- Index 7: T (but that's my body at (7,5) before I move, so after I move, (7,5) becomes empty)\n\n**THE REALITY:** After I move FROM (7,5), I leave that cell empty.

So DOWN to (7,4) would go to an apple!\n\n**BUT:** Is (7,4) occupied by my body? My body list includes (7,5) as head, and the body continues... let me check if (7,4) is in my body.\n\nMy body: [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8)]\n\n(7,4) is NOT in my body! So DOWN to (7,4) is safe AND there's an apple!\n\n**SIMILARLY:** Row 6, index 7 is '.' - empty! So UP is safe too.\n\n**LET ME CHECK ALL FOUR AGAIN:**\n\n1. **UP to (7,6):** Row 6: index 7 = '.' \u2192 EMPTY \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (7,4):** Row 4: index 7 = 'A' \u2192 Apple! \u2705 (not in my body)\n3. **LEFT to (6,5):** Row 5: index 6 = '1' \u2192 ENEMY BODY! \u274c DEAD\n4. **RIGHT to (8,5):** Row 5: index 8 = 'T' \u2192 Is this my body? (8,5) is in my body list \u2192 \u274c DEAD\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP and DOWN!\n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICE:**\n\n**UP to (7,6):** \n- No apple, just positioning\n- But what's up there? Row 6 is \" . . T T . T T . . T\" - open spaces\n- From (7,6), I could go LEFT to (6,6) [T - body], RIGHT to (8,6) [T - body], UP to (7,7) [T - body], DOWN back to (7,5) [empty]\n- This seems like another trap!\n\n**DOWN to (7,4):**\n- **APPLE!** I grow to 29 apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy at (5,5) is 2 cells away\n- From (7,4), what are my options?\n  - UP to (7,5) [empty after I leave]\n  - DOWN to (7,3): Row 3: index 7 = '.' (row 3: \" . T . . A T T . T T\") \u2192 EMPTY\n  - LEFT to (6,4): Row 4: index 6 = 'T' (enemy body at (6,4)) \u2192 DEAD\n  - RIGHT to (8,4): Row 4: index 8 = 'T' (my body at (8,4)) \u2192 DEAD\n\n**WAIT!** (7,4) DOWN to (7,3) is '.' - empty! So I'd have a path!\n\n**THE MATH:** \n- Current score: 28 vs 21\n- If I eat apple at (7,4): I go to 29 apples\n- Need 1 more apple to reach 30 and WIN!\n- Enemy needs 9 more apples to catch up!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- Go DOWN to (7,4) - eat apple \u2192 29 apples\n- From (7,4), next turn go DOWN to (7,3) - no apple but positioning\n- From (7,3), I'm at y=3, can move toward center/apples\n- Meanwhile, enemy is at (5,5) with 21 apples, trapped on left side\n\n**THE WIN CONDITION:** I just need ONE MORE APPLE. There are apples everywhere: (4,7), (5,4), (4,3), (2,4), etc.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** Take the guaranteed apple NOW, extend my body, get closer to victory!\n\n**CHAT, ARE YOU READY?!** This is the winning move! I'm going DOWN to grab that apple and get to 29! Then ONE MORE and we VICTORY! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

Tight, dangerous. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- LEFT -> (4,5) = apple and gives multiple follow-ups (4,6 / 3,5 / 4,4). Keeps options open and lets us pressure from the left side without forcing a head-on. \u2705\n\nStrategic thought: opponent leads on apples \u2014 we should NOT force a head-on. We want to corral them toward their heavy body cluster on the right wall, not trade our life for a tie. Taking LEFT gets an apple, preserves multiple escapes, and keeps pressure. If they swing toward us, we can pivot up/left to hem them in. Stay aggressive but avoid collision risks.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Grab (4,5) and maintain lateral pressure on their head at (7,5).  \n- Avoid moving into (5,4) \u2014 it\u2019s a choke unless we know their head is committed elsewhere.  \n- Force them toward their own long body/right wall, grow only when it helps close exits, and never give up an easy double KO.\n\nLEFT",

Our target is clear: get to (6,2) to eat that apple and hit 30 apples to WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**CURRENT PATH:** \n(7,3) \u2192 DOWN to (7,2) \u2192 LEFT to (6,2) = APPLE! \u2192 30 APPLES! VICTORY!\n\n**ANALYZING THE BOARD FROM (7,3):**\n- **UP to (7,4):** That's where I just came from. Is it safe? From the board state, row 4: \" . T A . . A T A T T\" - Index 4 is '.' - EMPTY! But wait, that's the cell I just left. Since I moved from (7,4) to (7,3), (7,4) should be empty now. \u2705\n- **DOWN to (7,3):** Row 3: \" . T . . A T T . T T\" - Index 7 is '.' - EMPTY! That's my destination! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (6,3):** Row 3: index 6 is 'T' - That's enemy body! Snake #1's body at (6,3) \u274c DEAD\n- **RIGHT to (8,3):** Row 3: index 8 is 'T' - My own body! \u274c DEAD\n\n**ONLY SAFE MOVE:** DOWN to (7,3) is where I'm going, but wait...\n\n**HOLD ON CHAT!** I'm ALREADY at (7,3)! My head is currently at (7,3). I need to move FROM (7,3) to the NEXT cell!\n\n**FROM CURRENT HEAD (7,3):**\n- **UP to (7,4):** Just left it, should be empty. But is there an apple there? No, apple was at (7,3) but I just moved into it? Wait, no apple at (7,3) in the list... Let me check apples again!\n- **DOWN to (7,2):** Row 2: \" . T T A . T A . T T\" - Index 7 is '.' - EMPTY! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (6,3):** Enemy body! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (8,3):** My body! \u274c\n\n**WAIT!** I need to check if (7,3) has an apple! Looking at apple drops: (7,8), (4,7), (5,4), (4,3), (2,4), (0,0), (6,8), (6,0), (0,9), (1,1), (4,1), (6,2), (3,2)... NO APPLE AT (7,3)!\n\nSo I'm just moving into an empty cell at (7,3). Now I need to choose my next move FROM (7,3).\n\n**DECISION:**\n- UP to (7,4): Safe? Possibly, but I just came from there and it's going backward\n- DOWN to (7,2): Leads directly to (6,2) apple next turn! \u2705 BEST OPTION\n- LEFT/RIGHT: DEAD\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nTurn 60: Move DOWN to (7,2) \nTurn 61: Move LEFT to (6,2) - EAT APPLE \u2192 30 APPLES \u2192 VICTORY!\n\n**LET'S DO THIS CHAT!** No hesitation! DOWN to (7,2) sets up the winning shot!\n\nDOWN",

Quick sweep and then we push.\n\nQuick legality and danger check from our head (4,4):\n- UP -> (4,5) = our neck. BACKWARDS = insta-death. NO. \u274c  \n- RIGHT -> (5,4) is an apple, tempting \u2014 but hold up: EVERY adjacent cell around (5,4) is currently occupied by our own body. If we eat that apple we GROW (tail doesn\u2019t move) and we\u2019d be stuck with zero exits next turn. That\u2019s a suicide trap. NO. \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udf4e  \n- LEFT -> (3,4) is legal and open. Keeps mobility, can head toward the apple at (2,4) later. Safe option. \u2705  \n- DOWN -> (4,3) is legal and has an apple too, with multiple free follow-ups (3,3 and 4,2). We get growth and still have escape routes. \u2705\n\nOpponent head (7,3) analysis: neck at (7,4) so UP is backwards/illegal; RIGHT/UP are into their own body; LEFT is into our body at (6,3) = death for them. So they\u2019re almost certainly forced DOWN to (7,2). No immediate head-on threat this turn \u2014 we should NOT seek head-on (they lead apples 29 \u2192 22). Play smart, not reckless.\n\nDecision logic: LEFT keeps options but skips an apple. RIGHT is a literal trap. DOWN grabs an apple safely and leaves multiple exits \u2014 best blend of content and survival. We\u2019ll take the apple at (4,3) but not overcommit into dead-ends. Grow when it preserves mobility.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Move DOWN to grab (4,3). Keep exits open (3,3 and 4,2).  \n- Force them further right by occupying central lanes; avoid head-on until we close the apple gap.  \n- Look for opportunities to shepherd them into their own long body/wall \u2014 collapse exits on their right flank and cut off escapes. Be aggressive but don\u2019t walk into a trap.\n\nWe go DOWN. DOWN",

They\u2019re basically handed +1 apple this turn and will hit 30 if they take it. We can\u2019t reach (6,2) to contest it this turn. Brutal, but facts are facts.\n\nDecision \u2014 do we chase a futile block or preserve space and options? We CANNOT stop their apple this turn, so don\u2019t walk into a tighter trap. LEFT to (3,3) keeps more escape routes (up/left/down available next turn), lets us pivot toward apples at (2,4)/(3,2) after they finish their bite, and keeps pressure on their flank for future collapse plays.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (3,3). Maintain mobility and avoid hugging walls.\n- Pivot toward (2,4) or loop down to (3,2)/(4,1) depending on how their body grows after the apple \u2014 look for a choke point on their right flank.\n- If they overcommit rightward after eating, collapse from the left and force them into their own long body/walls. Be ready to trade space for apples when the opportunity to KO arises.\n\nLET\u2019S GO \u2014 LEFT\n\nLEFT",
