There is an enemy snake at position (3, 8) with a body segment at (3, 9).\n\nThere are 5 apples on the board, located at (3, 6), (7, 0), (8, 3), (6, 1), and (5, 9).\n\nBased on the current position of my snake, the closest apple appears to be the one at (3, 6). The best strategy would be to move my snake towards that apple to gain the next point.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT would put my snake in close proximity to the enemy snake, which could be risky. Instead, I think I'll move LEFT to avoid the enemy and get closer to the apple at (3, 6).\n\nLEFT\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to continue moving towards the apple at (3, 6) to gain the next point. If I successfully eat the apple, I will then assess the board again to determine the best direction to move towards the next closest apple."

          "rationale": "Let me analyze my current situation:\n\nI'm at position (3, 8) with my body at [(3, 9)]. Looking at the board, I can see the current state clearly.\n\nAvailable moves from (3, 8):\n- UP: Would move to (3, 9) - NO! That's where my body is, I'd hit myself\n- DOWN: Would move to (3, 7) - empty space, safe\n- LEFT: Would move to (2, 8) - empty space, safe  \n- RIGHT: Would move to (4, 8) - empty space, safe\n\nCurrent apples remaining:\n- (3, 6) - directly below me, 2 moves down\n- (7, 0) - bottom right corner\n- (8, 3) - middle right\n- (6, 1) - bottom middle-right\n- (5, 9) - top row, to my right\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3, 1) with body at [(2, 1)] - they're in the bottom area but not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy analysis:\nThe apple at (3, 6) is very appealing since it's directly below me - I could reach it in 2 moves by going DOWN twice. This would be efficient and give me a quick point.\n\nThe apple at (5, 9) is also relatively close, but I'd need to move RIGHT then UP, or find another path around my body.\n\nI think the best move is to go DOWN toward the apple at (3, 6). This keeps me in a straight line toward a guaranteed apple, and the path is clear with no obstacles.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving DOWN to (3, 7), then DOWN again to (3, 6) to collect the apple. After that, assess the board for the next closest apple.\n\nDOWN"
