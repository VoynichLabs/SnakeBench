If I move RIGHT to (5,7), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5,7), we would have a head-on collision and both die. However, RIGHT is not safe anyway because it would move me into my own body.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,6) is safe and moves me closer to the apple at (4,2). This apple is closer to me than the apple at (7,6) is to the enemy snake. The apple at (4,2) is at the same x-coordinate as my current position, so moving down is a direct path to it.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,7) is safe but doesn't move me closer to any apple.\n\nMoving UP to (4,8) is safe but moves me away from all apples.\n\nThe best move is DOWN to (4,6) because:\n- It's safe\n- It moves me closer to the apple at (4,2)\n- It's a direct path to an apple that's closer to me than the enemy's closest apple\n- It keeps me on a vertical path which is safer than horizontal paths when the enemy is to my right\n\nDOWN",
