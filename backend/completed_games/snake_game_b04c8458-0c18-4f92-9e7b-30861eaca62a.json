Since enemy #2 could potentially move RIGHT to (2,4) on its turn, that increases the collision risk.\n\nBetween RIGHT and DOWN, moving RIGHT to (3,5) offers a safer approach while still making progress toward apple (4,3).\n\nStrategy note for upcoming turns:\n\u2022 From (3,5), we can continue steering toward (4,3) by planning moves that avoid enemy snake #2\u2019s zone.\n\u2022 We\u2019ll monitor the enemy\u2019s possible moves and adjust if necessary to keep a safe distance.\n\nTherefore, our chosen move for the next turn is: RIGHT."
