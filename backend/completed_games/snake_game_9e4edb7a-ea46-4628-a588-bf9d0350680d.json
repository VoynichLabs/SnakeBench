That's (8,9). Also safe! No body segments there.\n\nSo we've got TWO safe moves: DOWN or LEFT. Let's think this through...\n\nWe need to get aggressive! Snake #0 is way over at (1,7) - we gotta close that distance. If we go DOWN to (9,8), we're moving away from them. If we go LEFT to (8,9), we're still at the top edge but getting closer horizontally.\n\nBut here's the play - we want to control the board and box them in! From (9,9), going LEFT puts us on the same y-coordinate as the top row, letting us start pushing inward. Going DOWN just drops us one row without changing our horizontal position.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS:** We need to start pushing toward the center and cut off Snake #0's escape routes. Get to the middle, then start creating walls they can't pass. Remember - if we have more apples and force a head-on collision, WE win!\n\nLEFT!",

We're at (1,7), prime spot to start scheming. No apples munched yet, but we're growing to DOMINATE this 10x10 battlefield. Fans, you ready for me to box this fool in? Let's think this through LIVE!\n\nFirst, scouting ALL directions like a pro\u2014can't yeet myself off the edge or into nonsense on turn one:\n\n- **UP** to (1,8): Empty dot up there, keeps me high on the board, options wide open. Enemy's way up-right, this inches toward center control. Safe? 100%. \ud83d\ude80\n\n- **DOWN** to (1,6): Empty below, heads toward that apple cluster around y=5-6. Solid for early growth without trapping myself. Safe AF. \ud83d\udcc9\n\n- **LEFT** to (0,7): Wall on the left edge, but empty\u2014limits my wiggle room a bit, enemy far away, not aggressive enough yet. Still safe, though. \ud83d\udd76\ufe0f\n\n- **RIGHT** to (2,7): Empty to the east, pushes me toward the middle where apples lurk (like (3,5) nearby). Opens paths to chase or cut off the rival. Safe and ballsy! \ud83d\udca5\n\nAll moves keep me alive\u2014no bodies to smash into, board edges respected. No death traps here, chat! Now, ruthless mode: We're tied, so no forcing collisions yet, but I wanna position to grow FASTER than him. UP keeps vertical flex, DOWN grabs apple potential quick (that (1,5) is TWO moves away), LEFT hugs the wall (boring, nah), RIGHT advances toward his side of the board\u2014aggressive cut-off vibes! Prioritizing open futures and apple proximity without head-on risks (he'll move too, but he's cornered already). Let's build length to trap him early\u2014grow or go home!\n\nShort-term plan: Next 3 turns, prioritize RIGHT/UP path to center apples like (3,5) or (5,8) while eyeing his moves\u2014force him left/down into my expanding zone. If he heads south, cut him off at x=5-6. Dominate the mid-board!\n\nRIGHT",

Solid survival, but aggression demands growth over chill positioning\u2014pass when we can balloon now! \ud83e\udd10\n\n- **RIGHT** to (6,8): Open east nudge (row8 col6 ., clear shot), pressures his col8 flank without risk.

Solid backup, but aggression demands the spear thrust! \u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nOnly DOWN/RIGHT safe (no deaths, no head-ons\u2014his shorty can't touch us), both keep options poppin' (multiple empties ahead), but DOWN rockets closer to apples like (5,2)/(6,3) AND his position for collision force (our length wins ties), walls col6 as a barrier, avoids tight spots\u2014RIGHT just chills top while he scurries.

From (6,6), going UP puts us one row closer to the top where they are, letting us start pushing inward from a better position. Going LEFT also moves us toward the center. Going RIGHT just keeps us in the middle.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- Get to the top and start creating walls they can't pass\n- Force them into tight spaces where they'll crash\n- If we have more apples and force a head-on collision, WE WIN!\n\nUP!
