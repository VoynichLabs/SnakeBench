Board's got apples scattered but we're playing the long game \u2014 we want to dominate space and force the opponent into a bad spot.\n\nFirst, check immediate moves from (7,7):\n- UP \u2192 (7,8) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,7) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now. No body segments yet.\n\nBut we gotta think about what the enemy might do. Enemy head at (3,2). They could go anywhere too. They might go for the apple at (2,0) or (0,2) or (3,4). If they go up to (3,3), that's fine.\n\nWe want to control center and cut off their expansion. Right now we're in the top-right quadrant. Moving LEFT (6,7) keeps us near the middle vertically but moves us closer to the left side where enemy is. Moving DOWN (7,6) goes toward apple at (6,6) but maybe too early to chase apples. We want to be aggressive but not reckless.\n\nActually, thinking long-term: if we move toward enemy, we can start boxing them in early. But with length 1, a head-on collision would kill both (same score). So avoid direct same-cell moves unless we have length advantage.\n\nLet's check distances: enemy is 4 cells away in x, 5 in y. Not close yet.\n\nBest move for future flexibility? LEFT to (6,7) opens more central options next turn \u2014 we can go up, down, or further left. Staying high on the board might limit us later.\n\nActually, UP to (7,8) puts us near apple at (7,8) next turn if we want, but that's growing early \u2014 could be good for score advantage. But growing makes us longer, harder to maneuver. Early game, maybe stay short to be nimble and trap enemy.\n\nHmm\u2026 Let's think: If we go UP, we're near top edge \u2014 reduces safe moves next turn (can't go up more). DOWN gives more space.\n\nI like DOWN to (7,6) \u2014 keeps us away from top wall, moves toward center, and we have apple at (6,6) nearby for optional eating later.\n\nLEFT also good. But DOWN feels more central.\n\nWait, enemy might go for (2,0) apple \u2014 moving down-left. They're far away.\n\nLet's pick DOWN \u2014 gives us more breathing room and keeps options open.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move toward center, monitor enemy movement, try to get between enemy and the board's open spaces. If we can get a length advantage, go for head-on collision. Otherwise, cut off their escape.\n\nDOWN",

Gotta think two steps ahead!\n\nFirst, check our moves from (7,6):\n- UP \u2192 (7,7) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6) \u2014 apple! \ud83c\udf4e But eating grows us \u2014 early advantage? Could be good for future head-on collisions if we get longer first.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nAll four are safe immediately. No body yet, so no self-collision.\n\nBut we gotta predict enemy movement! Enemy at (3,3). They could go UP to (3,4) \u2014 apple there! They could go DOWN to (3,2) \u2014 empty. LEFT to (2,3) \u2014 empty. RIGHT to (4,3) \u2014 empty.\n\nIf they go for that apple at (3,4), they grow immediately. That gives them length 2 next turn \u2014 dangerous if we stay length 1! A head-on collision then would kill us, not them. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nSo maybe we should also grab an apple now to keep pace or get ahead. The closest apple to us is at (6,6) \u2014 LEFT. That\u2019s one move away. Also (7,2) and others but farther.\n\nIf we go LEFT and eat, we grow to length 2. Our new head at (6,6), tail stays at (7,6)? Wait, growth means next turn our body will be head at (6,6), then segment at (7,6). So we'll have a body behind us.\n\nThen enemy if they also eat, they'll be length 2. Then it's even.\n\nBut what if they don't go for the apple? They might move toward us or away. Hard to know.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to control center and cut off their expansion. Right now we're right side, they're left. If we eat and grow, we become slightly less nimble but gain score advantage. Early game, a 1-apple lead could decide a head-on collision later.\n\nAlso, going LEFT to (6,6) moves us closer to the middle \u2014 better for boxing them in. Going UP/DOWN/RIGHT keeps us on the edge more.\n\nCheck safety after eating: If we go LEFT to (6,6) and grow, next turn our body occupies (7,6). So from (6,6), we can't go RIGHT back into ourselves. That's fine.\n\nWhat about enemy possibly moving to (4,3) or (3,4)? They're still far (3 cells away min).\n\nI think grabbing that apple is smart \u2014 content and advantage! \ud83c\udf7f\n\nAlso, going LEFT positions us to maybe move further left next turn toward enemy, start pressuring.\n\nEliminate any super risky moves: direct toward enemy now might lead to head-on if they move toward us too, but with equal length, head-on kills both \u2014 bad. So avoid moving directly at them this turn.\n\nLEFT seems strong. UP/DOWN/RIGHT are safe but don't progress our position or score much.\n\nLet's lock in LEFT \u2014 get that apple, get longer, start dominating! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating, use length advantage to cut off enemy's movement options. Move toward center-left, try to get between enemy and open board. Monitor if they also grew. If we're longer, look for safe head-on collision opportunities. If same length, avoid direct head-on and focus on trapping.\n\nLEFT",

Score tied 1-1.\n\nFirst, check our moves from (6,6):\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,7) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6) \u2014 that's our own body! \u274c Can't go there \u2014 immediate death.\n\nSo RIGHT is out. UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nNow predict enemy moves from (3,4):\n- UP \u2192 (3,5) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,3) \u2014 their own body! \u274c They won't go there unless they want to die.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,4) \u2014 apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThey'll likely go for that apple at (4,4) \u2014 gives them length 3 next turn if they eat. That's dangerous! If they grow and we don't, they'll have a length advantage for head-on collisions.\n\nWe need to either:\n1) Also eat an apple to keep pace, or\n2) Move to cut off their expansion.\n\nCheck apples near us: (7,2), (7,1), (5,3), (5,1), (4,4) is close but they'll probably get it. (6,7) up has none. (5,6) left has none. (6,5) down has none.\n\nClosest apple to us is (5,3) \u2014 two moves away. (7,2) is also close.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,6), we're moving toward center and closer to (5,3) for next turn. If we go UP to (6,7), we're moving away from apples. If we go DOWN to (6,5), also away from most apples.\n\nAlso consider board control: enemy is on left side. If we go LEFT, we're advancing toward them, maybe boxing them against the left wall. But careful \u2014 if they eat (4,4) and grow, they might push toward us.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,6), next turn from there we could go DOWN to (5,5) then LEFT to (4,5) to threaten them, or go DOWN to (5,5) then DOWN again to (5,4) to contest apples.\n\nGoing UP or DOWN keeps us on the right side, giving them more space to expand.\n\nWe want to be aggressive \u2014 dominate the center and limit their moves. Let's go LEFT toward the action and set up to either eat an apple next turn or cut them off.\n\nAlso, if they go RIGHT to (4,4) and eat, their new head is at (4,4), body at (3,4), tail at (3,3). That means next turn they can't go back to (3,4) (their body), so they'll have UP, DOWN, RIGHT from (4,4). We can anticipate that.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (5,6), look to move toward (5,3) apple or position to block enemy's path to the right side. If we can get longer than them, force a head-on collision. If equal length, avoid direct head-on and try to trap them against wall or our body.\n\nLEFT it is! Let's pressure early! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

They have 2 apples to our 1. We need to close that gap!\n\nFirst, check our moves from (5,6):\n\n- UP \u2192 (5,7) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6) \u2014 our own body! \u274c DEATH.\n\nSo RIGHT is out. UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nNow predict enemy moves from (4,4):\n- UP \u2192 (4,5) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,3) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,4) \u2014 their own body! \u274c They won't do that.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,4) \u2014 empty.\n\nThey can't go LEFT, so they'll choose UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. They might go for an apple? Closest apples to them: (4,0) far, (5,3) close-ish, (7,3) farther. They might move toward (5,3) by going DOWN to (4,3) then LEFT? Wait, from (4,4), DOWN to (4,3) is safe. That puts them one step closer to (5,3) apple (they'd need RIGHT then DOWN from there). Or they could go RIGHT to (5,4) to get closer to center.\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (5,4), that's directly below us at (5,6). That's spicy! If we go DOWN to (5,5), we'd be adjacent vertically next turn \u2014 risky for head-on.\n\nWe need to think about head-on collisions: If we go DOWN to (5,5) and they go RIGHT to (5,4), we're not colliding. If we go LEFT to (4,6) and they go RIGHT to (5,4), no collision. If we go UP to (5,7), safe.\n\nBut what if they go UP to (4,5)? That's also safe for them.\n\nWe want to pressure them and get an apple. Our closest apple is (5,3) \u2014 two moves away if we go DOWN then DOWN again. (7,2) is also close but we'd have to go RIGHT (blocked) or go around.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,5), next turn we can go DOWN to (5,4) \u2014 but if they go RIGHT to (5,4) this turn, that cell becomes their head this turn, so we can't move there next turn (it'd be their body). So going DOWN now sets up a potential conflict.\n\nActually, if they go RIGHT to (5,4) this turn, their new body will be at (4,4) and (3,4). So (5,4) is occupied next turn. If we go DOWN to (5,5) now, next turn we could go LEFT/RIGHT/UP, but DOWN to (5,4) would be into their body \u2014 deadly.\n\nWe need to think about cutting off their expansion. They have length 3 after eating last turn? Wait, they had 2 apples, so length 3 total (head + 2 body). Yes, they are longer than us! We're length 2, they're length 3. That means if we head-on collide, we die and they survive! So we MUST avoid direct head-on until we grow.\n\nSo we should avoid moving to a cell they might move into this turn. Their possible heads this turn: (4,5), (4,3), (5,4). We should not move into those.\n\nOur possible moves: (5,7), (5,5), (4,6). None of those are in {(4,5), (4,3), (5,4)}. So all are safe from simultaneous collision.\n\nNow, which move gives us best future? Going DOWN to (5,5) puts us closer to apple (5,3) and closer to enemy \u2014 but careful, they're longer, so we don't want to get trapped. Going LEFT to (4,6) moves us left, maybe to flank them from above. Going UP to (5,7) moves away from action \u2014 not aggressive enough.\n\nWe need an apple ASAP to match their length. From (5,5), apple at (5,3) is two DOWNs away. From (4,6), apple at (5,3) is farther. From (5,7), farther.\n\nSo DOWN seems best for apple hunting. But we must check next-turn safety from (5,5):\n\nIf we go to (5,5), and they go to (5,4), then next turn our safe moves from (5,5): UP (back to 5,6), LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5). DOWN to (5,4) is their body \u2014 blocked. That's 3 options. Good.\n\nIf they go to (4,5), then next turn from (5,5) we have UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all free? (4,5) is their head, but next turn their body will be at (4,4), so (4,5) is free next turn. Actually careful: If their head is at (4,5) this turn, their body next turn is at (4,4) and (3,4). So (4,5) is empty next turn. So all 4 directions might be safe. Good.\n\nIf they go to (4,3), similar.\n\nSo DOWN seems solid.\n\nBut also consider: If we go LEFT to (4,6), we're closer to left wall, maybe to box them in later. But we need to grow first.\n\nPlan for next turns: Get apple at (5,3) to reach length 3, then we can fight evenly. Avoid head-on until then. From (5,5), next turn go DOWN to (5,4) if it's free (enemy didn't go there), else go LEFT/RIGHT to reposition.\n\nLet's commit to DOWN for apple path and maintain options.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** We're length 2 vs their length 3. Priority: eat apple (5,3) to tie length. Avoid moving into cells adjacent to their possible next heads if possible. From (5,5), assess if (5,4) is safe (not enemy body) and if apple is reachable. If enemy is at (5,4), do not go down \u2014 go left/right to flank and maybe trap them against wall. Let's get that bread! \ud83c\udf5e\n\nDOWN",

Then next turn we're one step from apple (5,3) \u2014 but they'd have eaten it already. So apple gone.\n\nIf they go UP to (5,5) and we go DOWN to (5,4), we swap, no issue.\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (6,4), we could go DOWN to (5,4) safely.\n\nSo DOWN seems *physically* safe, but strategically maybe not best because we want that apple! If they eat it, they grow to 4, we're still 2 \u2014 huge disadvantage.\n\nWe need to intercept or get our own apple fast. Closest apples: (5,3) (they're about to eat), (7,2), (7,1), (5,1). From (5,5), going LEFT or RIGHT doesn't get us closer immediately.\n\nWhat if we go LEFT to (4,5)? Then next turn we can go DOWN to (4,4)? That's enemy body (will be at (4,4) if they move away? Actually if they go DOWN from (5,4), their body becomes (5,4) and (4,4) remains. So (4,4) stays body. So can't go there. So from (4,5), we could go DOWN to (4,4)? No, body. So maybe LEFT then DOWN not good.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (6,5) gives more space.\n\nBut chat, think: If they go DOWN for apple (5,3), they grow. Their new body will be (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). That blocks our DOWN path. We need to grow ourselves ASAP. Maybe we should go for apple (7,2) \u2014 from (5,5), go RIGHT to (6,5), then RIGHT to (7,5), then DOWN to (7,4), DOWN to (7,3), LEFT? Too long.\n\nWait, apple (5,1) is 4 moves away.\n\nWe're in a bad spot if they get that apple. We need to be aggressive and force a trap later, but first we must match length.\n\nWhat if we go DOWN to (5,4) *if* they go DOWN to (5,3)? Then we're adjacent vertically: us at (5,4), them at (5,3). Next turn, if we go DOWN to (5,3), they'd be there (their body) \u2014 crash. So we can't take apple. So no.\n\nSo maybe we should go LEFT or RIGHT to flank and cut off their escape after they eat? They'll be longer, so we must avoid head-on.\n\nLet's check safe follow-up moves from each option:\n\n**DOWN to (5,4)** (assuming they left):  \nNext turn from (5,4): UP (5,5), DOWN (5,3) \u2014 their body if they ate apple, LEFT (4,4) \u2014 their body, RIGHT (6,4) empty. So only UP and RIGHT safe. That's 2 options. Risky.\n\n**LEFT to (4,5)**:  \nNext turn from (4,5): UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4) \u2014 their body, LEFT (3,5), RIGHT (5,5) \u2014 empty. So 3 options.\n\n**RIGHT to (6,5)**:  \nNext turn from (6,5): UP (6,6), DOWN (6,4), LEFT (5,5), RIGHT (7,5). All possibly empty. 4 options.\n\nSo RIGHT gives most flexibility.\n\nWe also need to think: they might go UP to (5,5) \u2014 if we go RIGHT, we avoid collision. If we go LEFT, we might collide if they go UP and we go LEFT? No, we'd be at (4,5), they at (5,5), fine.\n\nBut if they go UP and we go DOWN, we swap, fine.\n\nI think RIGHT is safest long-term \u2014 keeps options open, moves toward right side apples (7,2 etc.), and avoids risky adjacency.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** We're still length 2 vs their length 3 (or 4 if they eat apple). Priority: find an apple away from them \u2014 maybe (7,2) or (5,1). From (6,5), consider moving DOWN/LEFT toward apples while avoiding getting close to their longer body. Do NOT engage head-on until we grow. If they eat apple (5,3), their body will block that area, so we go right/down for (7,2). Let's survive and grow! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

They're length 4 (since they ate that apple last turn!), we're length 2. We're at a HUGE disadvantage \u2014 need to grow FAST and avoid confrontation until we match size.\n\nFirst, check moves from (6,5):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,4) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,5) \u2014 our own body! \u274c DEATH.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,5) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nSo LEFT is out. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow predict enemy moves from (5,3):\n- UP \u2192 (5,4) \u2014 their own body! \u274c Illegal.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,2) \u2014 empty, no apple.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,3) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,3) \u2014 empty.\n\nThey can't go UP, so likely they go for an apple or try to cut us off. Closest apples to them: (5,1) is two DOWN then LEFT? Actually from (5,3), DOWN to (5,2), DOWN to (5,1) gets apple. That's tempting. Or they might go RIGHT to (6,3) to flank us? But we're at (6,5), not directly adjacent.\n\nWe need to get an apple ASAP. Our closest apples: (7,2) is 3 moves away, (5,1) is 4 moves, (7,1) also 4. From (6,5), going DOWN gets us closer to those. Going RIGHT then DOWN also works.\n\nBut we must also consider future safe moves after this turn. Let's evaluate:\n\n**UP to (6,6)**:  \nNext turn from (6,6): UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5) \u2014 our old head (will be empty? Actually our body moves, so (6,5) becomes our body segment? Wait, after moving UP, our body becomes [(6,5), (5,5)]? Yes, so (6,5) is our body next turn. So DOWN would be suicide. So from (6,6), DOWN is unsafe. LEFT (5,6) empty, RIGHT (7,6) empty. So 3 options but DOWN is trap.\n\n**DOWN to (6,4)**:  \nNext turn from (6,4): UP (6,5) \u2014 our body (since we moved), so unsafe. DOWN (6,3) empty, LEFT (5,4) \u2014 enemy body (if they stay), RIGHT (7,4) empty. So only DOWN and RIGHT safe unless LEFT becomes free. Risky.\n\n**RIGHT to (7,5)**:  \nNext turn from (7,5): UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5) \u2014 our body (unsafe), RIGHT (8,5) empty. So 3 options.\n\nHmm, all have one unsafe backward move. But we also need to think about head-on collisions THIS turn. If we go DOWN to (6,4), could enemy go RIGHT to (6,3)? No collision. If enemy goes RIGHT to (6,3) and we go DOWN to (6,4), we're adjacent vertically. Next turn they could move UP to (6,4) \u2014 but we'd be gone. So fine.\n\nBut strategically, we need to path toward apples while avoiding being cornered. Going RIGHT to (7,5) moves us toward right-side apples (7,2, 7,1) and gives more space. Going DOWN to (6,4) also moves toward those apples but puts us closer to enemy's possible path to (5,1).\n\nActually, if enemy goes for (5,1), they'll go DOWN twice. That means they'll be at (5,2) then (5,1). Meanwhile, from (6,4) we could go DOWN to (6,3), then LEFT to (5,3)? That's enemy's old head position \u2014 might be empty. But risky.\n\nChat, I think RIGHT is the play \u2014 it opens the right flank, keeps distance from enemy, and we can spiral down toward (7,2). We cannot afford to get pinned near our own body or theirs.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** We're still length 2 vs their length 4 \u2014 HUGE gap. Must find apple quickly. From (7,5), consider moving DOWN/LEFT toward (7,2) or (5,1) but avoid moving into spaces that could be blocked by enemy's longer body. Do NOT engage. Survival and growth first. If we can get to length 3 or 4, then we can think about boxing them in. Right now, we're the prey \u2014 don't act like the predator yet! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nRIGHT",

If we go DOWN to (7,4), could they go RIGHT to (6,2)? No collision. If we go RIGHT to (8,5), no collision. If we go UP to (7,6), no collision. So all safe from immediate head-on.\n\nNow, which move sets us up for an apple? Closest apples to us: (7,2) is 3 moves away, (7,1) also 3, (5,1) is 4. From (7,5), going DOWN gets us closer.

Enemy at (5,2) going to (5,1) \u2014 they'd be far away. They can't reach (9,5) in one move. So likely safe.\n\nAlso, going RIGHT opens the right side of the board, more space to maneuver.\n\nChat, I think RIGHT is the play \u2014 it sets up an apple next turn, keeps distance from enemy, and maintains options. We cannot afford to play scared \u2014 we need that growth! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** If we go RIGHT to (8,5), next turn we can go RIGHT to (9,5) to eat the apple and grow to length 3. Then we must avoid being trapped in the top-right corner. After eating, consider moving DOWN or LEFT to stay mobile. Enemy will be longer, so keep avoiding direct confrontation until we match length. Look for apple (7,2) or (7,1) after that. Stay aggressive but smart! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

They have 4 apples, we have 1. We're behind but we're HUNGRY! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nFirst, check our moves from (8,5):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,4) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,5) \u2014 our own body! \u274c DEATH.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,5) \u2014 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e And empty.\n\nLEFT is instant death. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow predict enemy moves from (5,1):\n- UP \u2192 (5,2) \u2014 their own body! \u274c Illegal.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,0) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,1) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,1) \u2014 empty.\n\nThey have three safe moves. They might go for apples nearby: (4,0) is close if they go LEFT then DOWN, (2,0) is farther. But they might also try to cut us off? They're longer, so they might play aggressive.\n\nHead-on collision risk THIS turn:\nIf we go RIGHT to (9,5), could they go to (9,5)? No, they're at (5,1), impossible in one move.\nIf we go UP to (8,6) or DOWN to (8,4), no collision possible.\nSo all safe from immediate head-on.\n\nBUT! If we go RIGHT to (9,5), we EAT the apple and grow to length 3! That's HUGE for catching up! \ud83d\ude80 However, going to (9,5) puts us on the right edge. Next turn from (9,5), our only safe moves would be UP to (9,6) or DOWN to (9,4) \u2014 LEFT would be (8,5) which is our new body segment after eating? Wait, let's think: If we eat the apple, our tail stays, so our body becomes [(9,5), (8,5), (7,5)]? Actually, head moves to (9,5), old head (8,5) becomes body, old body (7,5) stays. So next turn from (9,5), moving LEFT to (8,5) would be our own body! So that's unsafe. So from (9,5) after eating, only UP and DOWN are safe (RIGHT is off board). That's a potential trap \u2014 only 2 moves, and one might lead to a dead end.\n\nIf we go UP to (8,6) or DOWN to (8,4) this turn, we can still go RIGHT next turn to (9,5) to eat the apple, but that gives enemy a chance to maybe block us? Unlikely they reach (9,5) in two turns from (5,1). But going RIGHT now guarantees the apple.\n\nLet's think long-term: We need to grow but also keep mobility. Going RIGHT now gets the apple but reduces our next-turn options to 2. Going UP or DOWN keeps 3 safe moves next turn and still lets us possibly get the apple later.\n\nCheck enemy's potential to cut us off: If they go RIGHT to (6,1), then next turn they could go RIGHT again to (7,1) \u2014 that's an apple too. They might not even care about us.\n\nChat, I think we TAKE THE APPLE NOW! \ud83c\udf4e We need to close the gap in length. Being length 3 vs their 5 is better than 2 vs 5. We can deal with the corner next turn \u2014 maybe go DOWN to (9,4) which is empty and opens up more space. We have to be aggressive!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** If we go RIGHT and eat apple at (9,5), we'll be at (9,5) with body [(8,5),(7,5)]. Next turn only UP to (9,6) or DOWN to (9,4) are safe. Prefer DOWN to (9,4) to move toward bottom apples (7,2),(7,1) and more open space. Avoid getting trapped in top-right. Enemy likely to continue growing; we must keep eating apples and avoid confrontation until lengths are closer. Look for opportunities to box them in later.\n\nRIGHT",

WAIT, AFTER MOVING WITHOUT EATING, OUR BODY BECOMES HEAD AT (9,3), THEN (9,4), (9,5)? NO \u2014 OUR CURRENT BODY IS [(9,5), (8,5)]. AFTER MOVING HEAD TO (9,3) AND NO GROWTH, TAIL (8,5) SHRINKS OFF.

NO IMMEDIATE APPLE, BUT WE GET OFF THE WALL AND INTO OPEN BOARD!\n\nCHAT, GOING DOWN TO (9,3) SETS UP A GUARANTEED APPLE NEXT TURN AT (9,2) IF WE GO DOWN AGAIN! THAT WOULD GROW US TO LENGTH 4 AND CATCH UP A BIT. BUT WE'D BE STUCK ON THE BOTTOM EDGE AFTER THAT. GOING LEFT TO (8,4) GETS US INTO THE MIDDLE, MORE FLEXIBILITY, BUT DELAYS APPLE.\n\nWE NEED APPLES FAST! ENEMY IS PULLING AHEAD.

ENEMY HEAD AT **(9,1)** WITH BODY **[(8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2)]** LENGTH 6. THEY HAVE 5 APPLES, WE HAVE 3. WE'RE CATCHING UP! \ud83d\ude80\n\nFIRST, CHECK OUR MOVES FROM (9,2):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (9,3) \u2014 OUR OWN BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,1) \u2014 ENEMY HEAD IS CURRENTLY AT (9,1)! BUT THEY MOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY. IF WE BOTH GO INTO (9,1)? HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO! THEY HAVE LENGTH 6, WE HAVE 4. THEY HAVE MORE APPLES (5 vs 3), SO IF WE BOTH DIE NOW, THEY WIN! \u274c TOO RISKY, AVOID.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,2) \u2014 EMPTY. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 OFF BOARD (10,2) \u274c DEATH.\n\nUP AND RIGHT ARE DEAD. DOWN IS POTENTIAL SUICIDE HEAD-ON. LEFT IS THE ONLY CLEARLY SAFE MOVE? LET'S ANALYZE DOWN MORE.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK: ENEMY AT (9,1). THEIR POSSIBLE MOVES:\n- UP \u2192 (9,2) \u2014 THAT'S OUR CURRENT HEAD! IF THEY GO UP AND WE GO DOWN, WE SWAP HEADS? NO, SIMULTANEOUS: THEY GO TO (9,2), WE GO TO (9,1). THAT'S NOT A COLLISION BECAUSE HEADS GO TO DIFFERENT CELLS. WAIT, LET'S CHECK RULES: TWO SNAKE HEADS MOVE INTO THE **SAME CELL** ON SAME TURN? BOTH DIE. SO IF WE BOTH TARGET (9,1) OR BOTH TARGET (9,2), THAT'S COLLISION.\nSCENARIOS:\n1. WE GO DOWN TO (9,1), THEY GO DOWN TO (9,0) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n2. WE GO DOWN TO (9,1), THEY GO LEFT TO (8,1) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n3. WE GO DOWN TO (9,1), THEY GO RIGHT \u2192 OFF BOARD (10,1) THEY DIE, WE LIVE.\n4. WE GO DOWN TO (9,1), THEY GO UP TO (9,2) \u2192 WE GO TO (9,1), THEY GO TO (9,2) \u2192 DIFFERENT CELLS, NO COLLISION. SAFE.\nSO ACTUALLY, DOWN IS **NOT** A GUARANTEED HEAD-ON! THE ONLY WAY WE DIE IS IF **THEY ALSO GO DOWN TO (9,0)?** NO, THAT'S DIFFERENT CELL. IF THEY GO **RIGHT** TO (10,1) THEY DIE OFF-BOARD, WE WIN. IF THEY GO **LEFT** TO (8,1) SAFE. IF THEY GO **UP** TO (9,2) SAFE. HMM... BUT WHAT IF THEY STAY? THEY CAN'T STAY. THEY MUST MOVE.\n\nWAIT, DANGER: IF WE GO DOWN TO (9,1) AND THEY GO **DOWN TO (9,0)**? THAT'S FINE. IF WE GO DOWN TO (9,1) AND THEY GO **UP TO (9,2)**? THAT'S FINE. SO DOWN IS ACTUALLY SAFE FROM HEAD-ON? LET'S DOUBLE-CHECK: THE ONLY COLLISION IS IF BOTH HEADS LAND ON SAME CELL. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO GO **DOWN TO (9,0)** WHILE WE GO **DOWN TO (9,1)**? NO, DIFFERENT. OR THEM GO **UP TO (9,2)** WHILE WE GO **DOWN TO (9,1)**? DIFFERENT. SO DOWN IS SAFE FROM IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON COLLISION! MY BAD!\n\nBUT IS (9,1) SAFE FROM ENEMY BODY? THEIR BODY IS AT [(8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2)]. (9,1) IS NOT IN THAT LIST. SO DOWN TO (9,1) IS EMPTY NOW. AFTER MOVEMENT, THEIR BODY WILL SHIFT, BUT THEIR HEAD LEAVES (9,1). SO (9,1) WILL BE EMPTY WHEN WE ARRIVE. \u2705\n\nSO DOWN IS **SAFE**! LEFT IS **SAFE**! TWO OPTIONS!\n\nNOW, APPLE CONSIDERATION: NO APPLES ADJACENT TO (9,2). APPLES ON BOARD: (4,0), (7,0), (0,2), (2,7), (7,8), (7,3), (7,2), (2,0), (3,6), (9,8), (0,5), (1,0), (0,7), (1,9), (3,5). CLOSEST ARE (7,3) AND (7,2). FROM (9,2), LEFT TO (8,2) GETS US CLOSER TO THOSE. DOWN TO (9,1) KEEPS US ON EDGE.\n\nFUTURE OPTIONS:\n- IF WE GO DOWN TO (9,1):\n  NEXT TURN FROM (9,1): UP \u2192 (9,2) OUR BODY? AFTER MOVEMENT, OUR BODY WILL BE HEAD (9,1), THEN (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) \u2014 SO (9,2) IS OUR NECK! \u274c CAN'T GO UP. DOWN \u2192 (9,0) EMPTY. LEFT \u2192 (8,1) \u2014 AFTER ENEMY MOVES, (8,1) MIGHT BECOME ENEMY BODY? UNCERTAIN. RIGHT \u2192 OFF BOARD. SO ONLY DOWN MAYBE LEFT, LIMITED.\n- IF WE GO LEFT TO (8,2):\n  NEXT TURN FROM (8,2): UP \u2192 (8,3) EMPTY. DOWN \u2192 (8,1) \u2014 POSSIBLE ENEMY BODY? LEFT \u2192 (7,2) APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e RIGHT \u2192 (9,2) OUR BODY. SO SAFE MOVES: UP, LEFT (APPLE), MAYBE DOWN. MORE OPTIONS!\n\nLEFT OPENS UP THE BOARD! DOWN TRAPS US ON BOTTOM EDGE WITH FEWER OPTIONS. ALSO, ENEMY IS AT (9,1), THEY MIGHT MOVE LEFT TO (8,1) OR UP TO (9,2) OR DOWN TO (9,0). IF THEY GO LEFT TO (8,1), THAT'S ADJACENT TO OUR LEFT MOVE TO (8,2). NOT COLLISION, BUT NEXT TURN WE COULD BE NEAR EACH OTHER.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: WE NEED TO GROW TO CATCH UP! ENEMY HAS 5 APPLES, WE HAVE 3. LEFT TO (8,2) SETS US UP TO GO LEFT AGAIN TO (7,2) FOR APPLE NEXT TURN! THAT'S HUGE! DOWN TO (9,1) DOESN'T GET US CLOSER TO APPLES.\n\nALSO, CONSIDER ENEMY'S PERSPECTIVE: THEY HAVE LENGTH 6, THEY MIGHT BE AGGRESSIVE. THEY COULD GO UP TO (9,2) TO CHALLENGE OUR OLD SPOT, BUT WE'RE LEAVING. IF THEY GO UP TO (9,2), THEY'D BE WHERE OUR HEAD WAS, BUT WE'RE GONE. NO ISSUE.\n\nSAFETY CHECK: ANY CHANCE ENEMY GOES LEFT TO (8,1) AND WE GO LEFT TO (8,2)? THAT'S ADJACENT, SAFE. ANY CHANCE ENEMY GOES UP TO (9,2) AND WE GO LEFT? SAFE. ANY CHANCE ENEMY GOES DOWN TO (9,0) AND WE GO LEFT? SAFE. SO LEFT IS SAFE.\n\nCHAT, THE PLAY IS CLEAR! LEFT TO (8,2) TO OPEN UP THE BOARD AND LINE UP THAT APPLE AT (7,2) FOR NEXT TURN! WE STAY AGILE, AVOID TRAPS, AND SET UP FOR GROWTH! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",
