Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,0) \u2013 inside board, no body there, not enemy body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,1) \u2013 inside board, safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 off board (10,1) \u2192 **DEATH**. Eliminate RIGHT.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and head-on collision risk:**  \n\nEnemy at (7,0) could move UP to (7,1), DOWN off board (7,-1) \u2192 death for them, so they won't choose DOWN unless they're suicidal (but they might be controlled by another AI, so assume they avoid death).  \nLEFT from (7,0) \u2192 (6,0), RIGHT \u2192 (8,0).  \n\nPossible enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nWhere could we collide head-on?  \nIf I go LEFT to (8,1) and enemy goes UP to (7,1) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I go DOWN to (9,0) and enemy goes RIGHT to (8,0) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I go UP to (9,2) and enemy moves anywhere \u2192 no collision.  \n\nActually, no possible head-on collision this turn because we are not adjacent in any direction.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nClosest apple to me (9,1):  \n- (7,4) is 3 units in x, 3 in y \u2192 Manhattan distance 6.  \n- (5,6) distance 9.  \n- (0,7) distance 15.  \n- (4,4) distance 10.  \n- (1,9) distance 17.  \n\nActually, (7,4) is closest.  \n\nFrom (9,1):  \n- UP to (9,2) \u2192 distance to (7,4) becomes 4 (Manhattan).  \n- LEFT to (8,1) \u2192 distance to (7,4) becomes 5.  \n- DOWN to (9,0) \u2192 distance to (7,4) becomes 10.  \n\nSo UP and LEFT both reduce distance to nearest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after move:**  \n\nCheck each safe move\u2019s next-turn options:  \n\n**UP to (9,2):**  \nNext turn from (9,2): UP (9,3), DOWN (9,1), LEFT (8,2), RIGHT off board \u2192 3 safe moves likely.  \n\n**LEFT to (8,1):**  \nNext turn from (8,1): UP (8,2), DOWN (8,0), LEFT (7,1), RIGHT (9,1) \u2192 all 4 moves safe unless enemy occupies.  \n\n**DOWN to (9,0):**  \nNext turn from (9,0): UP (9,1), DOWN off board, LEFT (8,0), RIGHT off board \u2192 only 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT). Worse.  \n\nSo DOWN is worse for future options.  \n\nBetween UP and LEFT:  \nLEFT gives 4 options next turn, UP gives 3. But UP moves me closer to apple (7,4) slightly more than LEFT does.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy position consideration:**  \n\nEnemy at (7,0) might move UP to (7,1). If I go LEFT to (8,1), I'm adjacent horizontally to (7,1) \u2014 not a problem now but next turn could risk head-on if we both move toward each other.  \n\nGoing UP to (9,2) keeps me farther from enemy initially.  \n\nGiven early game, it's good to avoid being too close to enemy head unless necessary.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nI'll choose **UP** because:  \n1. Safe.  \n2. Reduces distance to nearest apple (7,4).  \n3. Avoids adjacency with enemy\u2019s likely moves.  \n4. Still leaves 3 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (7,4) while keeping distance from enemy head to avoid collisions. Try to collect first apple to grow and gain advantage.  \n\nUP",

Safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,4): inside board, but that\u2019s my body segment \u2192 unsafe (death).  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy at (4,2) can move UP (4,3), DOWN (4,1), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2).  \nMy possible moves:  \n- UP (7,5) \u2013 far.  \n- DOWN (7,3) \u2013 far.  \n- LEFT (6,4) \u2013 far.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (4,4) distance 3 from (7,4).  \n- UP (7,5) \u2192 distance to (4,4) = 3.  \n- DOWN (7,3) \u2192 distance to (4,4) = 4.  \n- LEFT (6,4) \u2192 distance to (4,4) = 2.  \n\nLEFT gets me closest to (4,4).  \nOther apples: (5,6) distance 2 from (7,4) via UP then RIGHT, but (5,6) is closer in Manhattan distance from (7,4) = 2 (UP + LEFT).  \nActually: (5,6) is at x=5,y=6. From (7,4): |7-5|+|4-6| = 2+2 = 4.  \nFrom (7,4) to (5,6) is 4 steps.  \nFrom (7,4) to (4,4) is 3 steps.  \nSo (4,4) is closest.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \nFrom (6,4) after LEFT: safe moves UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4) \u2014 but (7,4) is empty now (tail moved? Wait, body is at (8,4) only, so (7,4) is empty after I move). Actually: current body: [(7,4), (8,4)]? No, body list is [(8,4)] only, head is (7,4). So after moving LEFT to (6,4), body becomes [(7,4), (8,4)]? Wait, I ate apple last turn, so I grew. Yes: I ate apple last turn, so my length increased by 1. That means this turn my body is [(8,4)] only? Let\u2019s check: Last turn head was (8,4), body none, ate apple at (7,4). So new head (7,4), new body segment added at old head position (8,4). So body = [(8,4)]. Correct.  \n\nSo after moving LEFT to (6,4), body becomes [(7,4), (8,4)]? No, snake movement: head moves to (6,4), each body segment moves to previous position of segment ahead. So segment 1 (currently at (8,4)) moves to old head position (7,4). So new body = [(7,4)].  \n\nThus from (6,4), safe moves:  \nUP (6,5): empty.  \nDOWN (6,3): empty.  \nLEFT (5,4): empty.  \nRIGHT (7,4): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves from (6,4).  \n\nFrom (7,5) after UP: body becomes [(7,4)].  \nSafe moves from (7,5): UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4) body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (7,3) after DOWN: body becomes [(7,4)].  \nSafe moves from (7,3): UP (7,4) body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Strategic choice:**  \nLEFT gets me closer to apple (4,4) and also toward center, keeps options open. Enemy at (4,2) might also go for (4,4) (UP to (4,3) then (4,4)). If we both aim for it, risk head-on collision in 2 turns. But currently safe.  \n\nI should maybe go UP toward (5,6) instead? Let\u2019s check distances:  \nFrom (7,4) to (5,6): Manhattan 4.  \nFrom (7,4) to (4,4): Manhattan 3.  \nBut (5,6) is less contested \u2014 enemy is at (4,2), far from (5,6).  \nGoing UP to (7,5) next turn can go LEFT toward (5,6) safely.  \n\nGiven enemy might go for (4,4), I could let them have it and aim for (5,6) to avoid early conflict while I\u2019m still short.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo UP now to (7,5), then next turn go LEFT to (6,5) or UP to (7,6) to approach (5,6). Avoid (4,4) until enemy passes it or I\u2019m longer. Keep distance from enemy head.  \n\nUP",

The head-on collision rule only applies if both heads move into the same cell simultaneously. If they're already at (5, 6) and I move there next turn, they would die (their head would hit my body) and I would survive.\n\n**Best path forward:**\nMoving UP to (5, 5) is the optimal choice because:\n1.

Safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5): enemy head currently there \u2192 possible head-on collision if enemy stays or moves into me. But enemy could also move away. Let's check:  \n  If I go DOWN to (5,5) and enemy also moves into (5,5) from its current (5,5), that means enemy stayed still? Wait, enemy can't stay still \u2014 must move one cell. So enemy at (5,5) now will move to one of its adjacent cells. If enemy moves UP to (5,6) \u2014 that's my current head, but I'm moving away to (5,5) \u2014 that would be a head-on collision? Let's analyze carefully:  \n  Both move simultaneously. If I go DOWN to (5,5) and enemy goes UP to (5,6), we swap positions \u2014 no collision because we occupy each other's previous cells.  \n  If I go DOWN to (5,5) and enemy goes DOWN to (5,4) (its own body), enemy dies.  \n  If I go DOWN to (5,5) and enemy goes LEFT to (4,5) or RIGHT to (6,5), no collision.  \n  However, if enemy goes UP to (5,6) and I go DOWN to (5,5), no direct collision.  \n  But if enemy goes DOWN to (5,4) (its body), enemy dies, so that's safe for me.  \n  The dangerous case is if enemy goes LEFT to (4,5) or RIGHT to (6,5) \u2014 still no collision with me at (5,5).  \n  Actually, the only way for a head-on collision at (5,5) is if enemy stays at (5,5), which is impossible. So DOWN is *potentially* safe in terms of immediate collision? Wait \u2014 but (5,5) currently contains enemy head. Moving into a cell occupied by another snake's head *on the same turn* is a head-on collision only if both heads move into the same cell. Here, enemy is already at (5,5) at start of turn. If I move into (5,5) and enemy moves out of (5,5), no collision. If enemy stays in (5,5) (illegal, must move), then collision. Since enemy must move, DOWN is safe from head-on collision? Let's check rules: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" That's for both moving into an empty cell. What about moving into a cell currently occupied by another snake's head? That would mean both heads in same cell after moves \u2014 so if enemy stays in (5,5) and I go to (5,5), we both end in (5,5) \u2192 collision. But enemy can't stay. So DOWN is safe from that.  \n  However, there's also rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" At start of turn, (5,5) is enemy head, not body. After movement, enemy's body will be at (5,5) only if enemy moved away and left its body there? No \u2014 enemy's body segments follow its head. So after movement, enemy's body will be at (5,4) (its previous head position) and maybe (5,3) if it grew. So (5,5) will be empty or have my head if I go there. So not hitting a body.  \n  So DOWN is not immediately fatal. But it's risky because if enemy moves UP to (5,6) (my current head), and I go DOWN to (5,5), we swap \u2014 no collision. So DOWN is *theoretically* safe.  \n\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6): inside board, empty. Safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6): my body segment \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo immediately safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy at (5,5) can move: UP (5,6) \u2014 my current head, but I'll move; DOWN (5,4) \u2014 its own body \u2192 unsafe for enemy; LEFT (4,5); RIGHT (6,5).  \n\nIf I go UP to (5,7), enemy could go UP to (5,6) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go LEFT to (4,6), enemy could go UP to (5,6) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go DOWN to (5,5) and enemy goes UP to (5,6) \u2014 swap, no collision.  \nIf I go DOWN to (5,5) and enemy goes LEFT to (4,5) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go DOWN to (5,5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (6,5) \u2014 no collision.  \nSo no direct head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApple (2,6) is 3 steps left and 0 steps vertically from (5,6).  \nApple (6,9) is 1 step right (but blocked by my body) and 3 steps up.  \nApple (0,7) is far.  \nApple (1,9) is far.  \nApple (2,0) is far.  \n\nClosest is (2,6) \u2014 need to go LEFT.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- UP to (5,7): body becomes [(6,6),(7,6)], safe moves from (5,7): UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6) body, LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- LEFT to (4,6): body same, safe moves from (4,6): UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6) body \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- DOWN to (5,5): body same, safe moves from (5,5): UP (5,6) body, DOWN (5,4) enemy body? Wait, enemy body after move will be at (5,4) if enemy moved away. So (5,4) will be enemy body \u2192 hitting it kills me. So DOWN (5,4) unsafe. LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5), UP (5,6) body. So only 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT) from (5,5) next turn if enemy body at (5,4). That\u2019s worse.  \n\nSo DOWN reduces future options.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Strategic choice:**  \nLEFT moves toward apple (2,6) and keeps good mobility.  \nUP also keeps good mobility but away from nearest apple.  \nDOWN is riskier (next turn fewer safe moves).  \n\nEnemy is at (5,5) now \u2014 if I go LEFT to (4,6), I put distance between us. If I go UP to (5,7), also distance. If I go DOWN to (5,5), we might end close.  \n\nGiven I have 2 apples vs enemy\u2019s 1, I should play safe and collect apples while avoiding risky adjacency.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove LEFT toward (2,6) apple. Next turn from (4,6), assess if enemy is approaching. Keep moving left toward apple unless blocked.  \n\nLEFT",

Safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,6): my own body segment \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo immediately safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy at (4,5) can move: UP (4,6) \u2014 my current head; DOWN (4,4); LEFT (3,5); RIGHT (5,5).  \n\nIf I go UP to (4,7), enemy could go UP to (4,6) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go LEFT to (3,6), enemy could go UP to (4,6) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go DOWN to (4,5) and enemy goes UP to (4,6) \u2014 swap, no collision.  \nIf I go DOWN to (4,5) and enemy goes LEFT to (3,5) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go DOWN to (4,5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (5,5) \u2014 no collision.  \nSo no direct head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApple (2,6) is 1 step left from (3,6) if I go LEFT now, then next turn I can eat it.  \nApple (6,9) is far.  \nApple (0,7) is far.  \nApple (1,9) is far.  \nApple (2,0) is far.  \n\nClosest apple is (2,6), reachable in two moves if I go LEFT now.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- UP to (4,7): body becomes [(5,6),(6,6)], safe moves from (4,7): UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6) body, LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- LEFT to (3,6): body same, safe moves from (3,6): UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5), LEFT (2,6) apple, RIGHT (4,6) body \u2192 3 safe moves, and next turn I can eat apple at (2,6) if safe.  \n- DOWN to (4,5): body same, safe moves from (4,5): UP (4,6) body, DOWN (4,4), LEFT (3,5), RIGHT (5,5) enemy body? After enemy moves, its body will be at (5,5) if it moved away, so (5,5) is enemy body \u2192 hitting it kills me. So RIGHT (5,5) unsafe. So safe moves: DOWN (4,4), LEFT (3,5) \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, and enemy is adjacent.  \n\nDOWN reduces future options and keeps me close to enemy.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Strategic choice:**  \nLEFT moves toward apple (2,6) and keeps good mobility.  \nUP moves away from nearest apple but keeps mobility.  \nDOWN is riskier (fewer safe moves next turn, adjacency to enemy).  \n\nGiven I have 2 apples vs enemy\u2019s 1, I should play safe and collect apples while avoiding risky adjacency.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove LEFT toward (2,6) apple. Next turn from (3,6), assess if enemy is approaching. If safe, move LEFT to (2,6) to eat apple. Keep distance from enemy.  \n\nLEFT",

If the enemy moves away, I'll take their position safely. If they stay still, I die.\n- **DOWN**: (3, 4) - Safe move, away from enemy\n- **LEFT**: (2, 5) - Safe move, could head toward the apple at (2, 6)\n- **RIGHT**: (4, 5) - This would move me into my own body at (4, 5). DEATH.\n\n**Enemy snake's possible moves:**\n- UP: (3, 7) - Safe, moves toward apples at higher y-coordinates\n- DOWN: (3, 5) - Critical! This would move into my current head position. If I stay still or move UP, we could collide.\n- LEFT: (2, 6) - Safe, toward apple at (2, 6)\n- RIGHT: (4, 6) - Moves to their own body at (4, 6). DEATH for them.\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nMoving to (3, 6) could be dangerous if the enemy moves down to (3, 5), but this is actually beneficial for me:\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (3, 5) and I move UP to (3, 6), they die because they moved into my body (my tail was at (4, 5), but I'll have moved away).\n- If enemy stays at (3, 6) and I move UP, we both die.\n- If enemy moves UP/LEFT and I move UP, I take their position safely.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the enemy moves more carefully. If they move DOWN to (3, 5), that space is currently unoccupied and safe for them. My tail was at (4, 5), so if they move to (3, 5) and I move UP to (3, 6), we both survive.\n\n**My recommended move - LEFT to (2, 5):**\nThis move:\n1. Keeps me alive and safe\n2. Positions me to potentially go after the apple at (2, 6) next turn\n3. Avoids the dangerous confrontation with the enemy snake\n4. Maintains good mobility options\n5. Creates distance between me and the enemy\n\n**Alternative safe moves:**\n- DOWN to (3, 4): Also safe but moves me further from most apples\n- UP to (3, 6): Too risky given the close enemy proximity\n\nLEFT",

Safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,5): enemy head currently there \u2192 moving into a cell occupied by enemy head at start of turn is risky. If enemy moves out, I occupy (3,5) and enemy\u2019s body will be at (4,5) (its previous head), so no collision with body. But if enemy stays (illegal) or moves into (3,5) from elsewhere? Enemy at (3,5) can move UP to (3,6) \u2014 my current head, but I\u2019ll move; DOWN to (3,4); LEFT to (2,5); RIGHT to (4,5). If enemy moves UP to (3,6) and I move DOWN to (3,5), we swap \u2014 no collision. However, if enemy moves RIGHT to (4,5) and I move DOWN to (3,5), no collision.

Wait: after eating apple, I grow by 1 at the end of the turn, so new body will be: head at (2,6), then old head (3,6), then old body segments (4,6),(5,6) plus new segment at (5,6) (tail duplicates for one turn before moving). Actually: growth means tail doesn\u2019t move this turn, so body after move: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)] length 4. Next turn from (2,6), safe moves: UP (2,7), DOWN (2,5), LEFT (1,6), RIGHT (3,6) body \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- DOWN to (3,5): body becomes [(4,6),(5,6)], safe moves from (3,5): UP (3,6) body, DOWN (3,4), LEFT (2,5), RIGHT (4,5) enemy body? After enemy moves, its body will be at (4,5) if it moved away, so (4,5) is enemy body \u2192 hitting it kills me. So RIGHT (4,5) unsafe. So safe moves: DOWN (3,4), LEFT (2,5) \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, and enemy is adjacent.  \n\nDOWN reduces future options and keeps me close to enemy.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Strategic choice:**  \nLEFT eats apple (2,6), grows to length 4, keeps good mobility.  \nUP avoids risk but misses closest apple.  \nDOWN is riskier (fewer safe moves next turn, adjacency to enemy).  \n\nGiven I have 2 apples vs enemy\u2019s 1, eating apple extends my lead safely.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nEat apple at (2,6) now.

Survival - avoiding collisions with enemy and myself\n2. Apple collection - positioning toward available apples\n3. Future mobility - keeping multiple safe options open\n\n**Move evaluation:**\n- LEFT (0, 5): Good positioning toward (0, 7) apple, keeps options open\n- DOWN (1, 4): Takes me toward (4, 1) apple but away from the cluster at top-left\n- UP (1, 6): Excellent - directly positions me for (0, 7) apple next turn, and potentially (1, 9) after that\n\nUP gives me the best path toward multiple apples while maintaining good future mobility. With my current short length (2 segments), I have good maneuverability in the left-side corridors.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue focusing on the left-side apple cluster ((0, 7), (1, 9)) to close the apple gap. Avoid direct confrontation with the longer enemy snake. Prioritize survival while collecting apples efficiently.\n\nUP",

If I go to (1,6) and enemy stays there or moves into it, possible head-on collision or I hit its body? Let's check: enemy body is [(1,5)], so (1,6) is currently enemy head, not body. If I move to (1,6) and enemy moves away, it's safe. But if enemy stays there (chooses not to move), both heads occupy same cell \u2192 both die. That's risky.
