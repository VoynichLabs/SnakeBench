Also, moving LEFT first gives me more flexibility - I can then choose to go UP when I'm closer to the left edge.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving toward the apple at (0, 9).

Perfect move to collect my first point\n- **DOWN**: Goes to (0, 7) - That's where my body is! Would kill me\n- **LEFT**: Goes to (-1, 8) - Outside the board! Would kill me\n- **RIGHT**: Goes to (1, 8) - Safe but moves away from the apple unnecessarily\n\nExcellent! My strategy has worked perfectly. I can now collect the apple at (0, 9) by moving UP. This will give me my first point and grow my snake.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After collecting this apple at (0, 9), I'll need to plan my next move carefully since I'll be in the top-left corner. I should look to move toward another apple - likely the one at (4, 2) since it's centrally located, or potentially work my way along the top edge. I'll need to avoid getting trapped in the corner and plan a safe path to the next apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\n**Current plan:**\n1. Move UP to (0, 9) to collect the apple and gain 1 point\n2. Next turn, assess the safest path to the next apple while avoiding corner entrapment\n\nUP",

I'm now just one move away from the apple at (4, 2)\n\n**Available moves:**\n- **UP**: Goes to (4, 4) - That's where my body is! Would kill me\n- **DOWN**: Goes to (4, 2) - That's the apple! Perfect move to collect it\n- **LEFT**: Goes to (3, 3) - Safe empty space but moves away from apple\n- **RIGHT**: Goes to (5, 3) - Safe empty space but moves away from apple\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nThis is exactly what I planned! I'm positioned perfectly to collect the apple at (4, 2) with a simple DOWN move. This will:\n1. Give me 1 point\n2. Make my snake grow longer\n3. Put me in a good central position to target the next apple\n\n**Enemy snake check:**\nSnake #1 is at (8, 5) with body at [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. They're still far away and not threatening my path to this apple.\n\n**Next turn strategy after collecting apple:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (4, 2), I'll be at the bottom center of the board. From there, I should evaluate:\n- Apple at (9, 2) - 5 moves to the right\n- Apple at (8, 4) - 4 moves right and 2 up\n- Apple at (9, 0) - 5 moves right and 2 down\n\nThe apple at (8, 4) looks most strategically positioned since it's closest and gives good board control.\n\n**Optimal move:**\nDOWN to (4, 2) to collect the apple!\n\nDOWN",

Would kill me\n- **DOWN**: Goes to (8, 0) - There's an apple here! This will give me a point and make me grow\n- **LEFT**: Goes to (7, 1) - Safe empty space, but no immediate benefit\n- **RIGHT**: Goes to (9, 1) - That's where Snake #1's body is! Would kill me\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nThis is a perfect setup from my last move. I'm positioned directly above an apple at (8, 0). Moving DOWN will:\n1. Give me 1 point\n2. Make my snake grow by 1 segment\n3. Put me in the bottom corner where I have good positioning\n\n**Next turn planning:**\nAfter grabbing the apple at (8, 0), I'll be in the bottom-left corner of the right side. The enemy snake's head is at (9, 0) so I need to be careful about that apple. I should probably move LEFT along the bottom row to avoid conflict and look for other opportunities, or assess if I can safely challenge for the (9, 0) apple.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\nMoving DOWN is completely safe and guarantees me a point. No collision risks.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After grabbing this apple, assess whether I can safely go for the apple at (9, 0) or if I should retreat LEFT to avoid the enemy snake and pursue other apples.\n\nDOWN",
