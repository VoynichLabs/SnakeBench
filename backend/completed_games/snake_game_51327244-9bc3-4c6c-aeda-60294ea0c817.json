Eat the nearest available apple to gain points.\n2. Avoid reversing direction which could lead to a collision.\n3. Watch out for Snake #0 in case it moves closer.\n\nThe apple at (4, 6) is right diagonal northwest \u2014 if I move UP\u2014it will hit a wall (y decreases and moves above 0), so UP is invalid.

So, after proper evaluation, **LEFT to (6,5)** appears the safest to initiate path exploration while avoiding wall collision and preparing for proximity to the apple.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT** (to (6,5)) next turn.",
