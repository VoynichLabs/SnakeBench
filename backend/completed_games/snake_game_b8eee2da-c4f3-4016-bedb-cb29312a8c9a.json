This could be efficient.\n\n3. **DOWN to (7, 5)**: Takes me away from the y=7 apples but could be useful for positioning.\n\nThe apples at (0, 7) and (1, 7) are at y-coordinate 7, and I'm currently at y-coordinate 6. Moving UP to (7, 7) would put me at the same y-level as these apples, making it easier to reach them by then moving left.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is the optimal choice. Moving to (7, 7) puts me at the same y-coordinate as the apples at (0, 7) and (1, 7), allowing me to move directly left toward them in subsequent turns. This is more efficient than continuing left at y=6 and then having to adjust vertically later.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving UP, continue moving LEFT along y=7 to reach the apples at (1, 7) and (0, 7). This gives me a clear path to two apples while maintaining good board position.\n\nUP",

From (3, 7), I'll be just 2 moves away from the apple at (1, 7).\n\n2. **UP to (4, 8)**: Takes me off the efficient y=7 path, which would be wasteful after positioning myself so well.\n\n3. **DOWN to (4, 6)**: Also takes me off the y=7 path and doesn't serve my apple collection strategy.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT is clearly the best choice.

This would give me 2 points total and continue executing my efficient apple collection strategy.\n\n**Evaluating my options:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (0, 7)**: EXCELLENT! This gets me the second apple in my planned sequence, grows my snake again, and gives me another point. After this, I'll have collected 2 apples in 2 moves - very efficient!\n\n2. **UP to (1, 8)**: This would abandon the apple that's right in front of me, which would be wasteful.\n\n3. **DOWN to (1, 6)**: Also abandons the immediate apple opportunity.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT is the clear choice. I'm about to collect my second apple and continue my successful strategy.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** \nAfter collecting the apple at (0, 7), I'll be in the top-left corner. I'll need to move either DOWN or RIGHT to avoid hitting the wall. I should head toward the cluster of apples at (2, 4) and (3, 4) next, as they're relatively close and the enemy snake is still focused on the lower area of the board.

This is concerning because we're in the same x-coordinate (x=2). If I move UP to (2, 9), I'd be staying in this same column, which could lead to a dangerous head-to-head collision if the enemy snake moves up toward me.\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 8) seems much safer because:\n1.

It positions me better to eventually approach the apple cluster at (2, 4) and (3, 4) from a safer angle\n4.

My strategy from last turn worked exactly as planned. I'm now at (3, 9) and the apple at (0, 9) is just 3 moves away to the left. The enemy snake is still far away in the lower area, so this apple is essentially free for me to take.\n\n**Plan to get the apple:**\n- This turn: LEFT to (2, 9)\n- Next turn: LEFT to (1, 9) \n- Turn after: LEFT to (0, 9) to collect the apple\n\nThis is a clear, safe path with no obstacles. The enemy snake can't possibly interfere since they're at (3, 4) and would need many moves to reach this area.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving LEFT toward (1, 9), then (0, 9) to collect the apple. After getting the apple, reassess the board and look for the next safest apple opportunity, likely one of the apples in the lower area once I understand the enemy snake's movement pattern better.\n\nLEFT",

The apple at (6, 3) is also relatively close, requiring me to move right and then down. The apple at (3, 0) is directly below me, requiring 4 steps down.\n\nMoving RIGHT brings me closer to two apples (the one at (8, 4) and the one at (6, 3)), which is more efficient than just going for one apple. This gives me flexibility in my next moves and opens up more of the board for me.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is far away in the top section of the board, I don't need to worry about competition for these apples.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving RIGHT, I should continue moving right to reach the apple at (8, 4), or consider moving down toward (6, 3) if that seems more advantageous based on the updated board state.\n\nRIGHT",

I'm trapped in the corner. Let me double-check the board state...\n\nActually, looking at the board again, I need to be more careful. After eating the apple, my snake should have grown, meaning my tail shouldn't have moved from its previous position. Let me recalculate...\n\nIf I ate the apple at (0, 9), my new body configuration should be:\n- Head: (0, 9) \n- Body: [(1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8)] - the tail stays because I grew\n\nThis means all four directions are blocked! This is a critical error in my planning - I got tunnel vision focusing on the apple without considering the escape route.\n\nHowever, looking at the board state provided, it shows I'm still alive, so let me trust the current position and analyze what's actually possible:\n\n**Re-examining available moves:**\n- UP: (0, 10) - Outside board boundaries\n- LEFT: (-1, 9) - Outside board boundaries  \n- RIGHT: (1, 9) - My body segment\n- DOWN: (0, 8) - My body segment\n\nThis appears to be a losing position.

Now my head is at (3, 1) and I need to decide my next move.\n\n**Current position analysis:**\n- My head is at (3, 1)\n- There's an apple directly below me at (3, 0) - just one move away!\n- My body now includes the previous head position at (3, 2) since I grew from eating the apple\n\n**Available moves from (3, 1):**\n- UP: (3, 2) - This would hit my own body (my first body segment is now at (3, 2))\n- DOWN: (3, 0) - This has another apple! Perfect continuation of my strategy\n- LEFT: (2, 1) - This appears empty but there's an apple at (2, 1) according to the apple list\n- RIGHT: (4, 1) - This appears empty but moves away from apples\n\nWait, let me double-check the apple positions: (8, 0), (3, 0), (4, 5), (7, 2), (2, 1)\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the board and apple list:\n- There's an apple at (3, 0) - one move DOWN\n- There's an apple at (2, 1) - one move LEFT\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. The apple at (3, 0) is easily accessible with a DOWN move\n2. The apple at (2, 1) is accessible with a LEFT move\n3. After getting the apple at (3, 0), I'd be at the bottom edge and would need to turn\n4. The enemy snake is far away at the top of the board, so no immediate threat\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- UP: FATAL - Would hit my own body\n- DOWN: EXCELLENT - Gets me another apple at (3, 0)\n- LEFT: GOOD - Gets me the apple at (2, 1) \n- RIGHT: Safe but no immediate benefit\n\nI think continuing DOWN to collect the apple at (3, 0) is the best move. This gives me another point and continues my successful apple-collecting streak along this column.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After collecting the apple at (3, 0), I'll be at the bottom edge of the board. I should then move LEFT or RIGHT to continue hunting for apples, likely heading toward the apple at (2, 1) or potentially working my way toward the other apples while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nDOWN",

It keeps me in open space with more maneuvering room\n2. It positions me better to potentially go after the apple at (7, 2) \n3. It doesn't box me into a corner like moving left might\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving to (2, 2), I should evaluate whether to continue toward the apple at (7, 2) or pivot toward one of the other apples.

Let me evaluate each:\n\n- UP (4, 9): Takes me to the top edge, limiting future options.\n- DOWN (4, 7): Moves me directly toward the apple at (4, 5), which is a good target.\n- LEFT (3, 8): Moves away from my body, giving me more room to maneuver.\n\nThe apple at (4, 5) is a clear priority as it's directly aligned with me and relatively close. Moving DOWN would set me on a direct path to this apple.\n\nLooking at the board layout, I see that moving DOWN provides a clear path toward the apple at (4, 5), and after collecting it, I could potentially navigate toward either the apple at (0, 5) or the apples on the right side of the board.\n\nThe enemy snake is far away at the bottom left, so there's no immediate threat of collision.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nI'll move DOWN to (4, 7) to approach the apple at (4, 5). On future turns, I'll continue down to collect this apple and then reassess the board to determine which apple to target next.

It keeps me away from the wall edge, giving me more future options\n2. It positions me to potentially access the apple at (4, 0)\n3. It avoids boxing myself against the left wall\n4.

The apple at (0, 5) might be a good target as it would take me away from my own body which is currently concentrated on the right side.

Looking at the board, I need to determine the best move to collect apples without hitting any obstacles.\n\nThe apples are at:\n- (8, 0): Far bottom right\n- (7, 2): Bottom right area\n- (0, 5): Far left, at y=5\n- (4, 0): Bottom, aligned with my current x-position\n- (5, 4): Immediately to my right\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (0, 1) with its body occupying several positions in the bottom left area.\n\n# Possible Moves Evaluation\n1. UP: Would move to (4, 5), which is part of my body - INVALID\n2. DOWN: Would move to (4, 3), which appears to be empty - SAFE\n3. LEFT: Would move to (3, 4), which appears to be empty - SAFE\n4. RIGHT: Would move to (5, 4), which contains an apple - SAFE and BENEFICIAL\n\n# Decision Making\nLooking at my options, RIGHT is clearly the best choice because:\n1. It leads directly to an apple at (5, 4)\n2. It's a safe move with no obstacles\n3. Growing my snake gives me more points and flexibility\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll need to plan my path carefully. I notice there's an apple at (4, 0) that's aligned with my current x-position, so heading downward after collecting the apple at (5, 4) might be a good strategy.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving RIGHT to (5, 4) and collecting that apple, I'll consider moving DOWN to begin approaching the apple at (4, 0). However, I'll need to be careful about navigating around my own body, which will be longer after collecting the apple. The bottom of the board has several apples, so developing a path to navigate there safely will be important.\n\nRIGHT",

This is exactly what I planned for.\n- DOWN: (0, 3) - This is where my body is, NOT safe (would be suicide)\n- LEFT: (-1, 4) - This would be outside the board (wall), NOT safe\n- RIGHT: (1, 4) - This is empty space, but why would I move away from a guaranteed apple?\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nUP to (0, 5) is the obvious best move because:\n1. It's safe (no obstacles there)\n2. I'll collect the apple and grow, gaining 1 point\n3. This was my planned target from the beginning\n4. I'm still staying along the safe left wall\n\n**After collecting this apple:**\nOnce I grab the apple at (0, 5), I'll need to plan my next move.

RIGHT: Would move to (7, 3) - This appears to be an empty space - SAFE\n\n# Decision Making\nI have three safe options: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n- DOWN would move me to (6, 2), positioning me closer to the apple at (7, 2)\n- RIGHT would move me to (7, 3), also getting me closer to the same apple but from a different angle\n- UP would move me to (6, 4), but this doesn't get me closer to any immediate apple\n\nThe apple at (7, 2) is the closest and most accessible to me right now. Moving DOWN to (6, 2) seems optimal as it puts me in a direct path to this apple, which I could reach in just two more moves (DOWN, then RIGHT).\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving DOWN to (6, 2), I'll plan to move RIGHT next turn to reach the apple at (7, 2).

If I move UP to (0, 7), I'll be at the same y-coordinate as that apple, and then I could move RIGHT twice to collect it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 6), I'd be one step closer horizontally but would still need to go up one level to reach the apple.\n\n**Enemy snake check:**\nSnake #1 has its head at (7, 2) and body concentrated in the middle-right area. It's not threatening either of my potential moves.\n\n**Apple priority:**\n- (2, 7) - Very close and accessible, excellent target\n- (8, 4) and (8, 8) - Further away near enemy territory\n- (4, 0) and (8, 0) - Bottom row, would require significant maneuvering\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll move UP to (0, 7) to get to the same y-coordinate as the apple at (2, 7).

My snake has grown after eating the apple, so I now have a longer body to avoid.\n\nLet me check each direction:\n- UP to (2, 8): Looking at the board, this appears to be empty space. Safe move.\n- DOWN to (2, 6): This appears to be empty space as well. Safe move.\n- LEFT to (1, 7): This is where my body segment is now (my previous head position). NOT safe.\n- RIGHT to (3, 7): This appears to be empty space. Safe move.\n\nNow I need to think strategically about which apple to target next. The available apples are at:\n- (8, 0) - Far away, bottom right\n- (4, 0) - Closer, bottom middle  \n- (8, 8) - Far away, top right\n- (4, 3) - Middle of board\n- (2, 9) - Close, directly above me\n\nThe apple at (2, 9) is very appealing since it's just 2 moves away if I go UP twice. However, I need to be careful about boxing myself in near the top wall.\n\nThe apple at (4, 3) is also interesting as it's in a more central location with better escape routes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 has its head at (8, 4) and seems to be occupying the right side of the board, so I should probably stay toward the left/center for now.\n\nI think moving UP toward (2, 8) is the best choice because:\n1. It's safe\n2. It moves me toward the apple at (2, 9) \n3. It keeps me away from the enemy snake\n4. It gives me flexibility for my next move\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving UP to (2, 8) to grab the apple at (2, 9), but be ready to change direction if I need to avoid boxing myself against the top wall. After getting that apple, consider moving toward (4, 3) for the next target.\n\nUP",

Safe move.\n- RIGHT to (4, 6): This is where enemy snake #1's body is. NOT safe.\n\nSo I have two safe options: DOWN to (3, 5) or LEFT to (2, 6).\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nMy primary target remains the apple at (4, 3). From my current position at (3, 6):\n- If I go DOWN to (3, 5), I'll be at distance 3 from the apple (need to go down 2 more, then right 1)\n- If I go LEFT to (2, 6), I'll be at distance 4 from the apple (need to go down 3, then right 2)\n\nGoing DOWN keeps me closer to my target apple and maintains a more direct path. From (3, 5), I should be able to continue down toward (3, 4) and then (3, 3), getting me very close to the apple at (4, 3).\n\nThe enemy snake #1 at (8, 8) still controls much of the eastern portion of the board with its long body, so staying in this central western corridor continues to be my best strategy for safe movement.\n\n**Looking ahead:** After moving to (3, 5), I should continue DOWN toward (3, 4) and then (3, 3) to position myself for a RIGHT move to capture the apple at (4, 3). I need to keep monitoring if enemy snake #1 moves toward this apple as well.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving DOWN toward the apple at (4, 3). From (3, 5), evaluate moving to (3, 4) to get even closer to the target apple.\n\nDOWN",

UP: Would move to (8, 9) - This appears to be empty space - SAFE\n2. DOWN: Would move to (8, 7) - This is part of my body - INVALID (would die)\n3.

The apple at (4, 3) is just one move away if I continue with my strategy:\n\n- If I go DOWN to (3, 3), I'll be at distance 1 from the apple at (4, 3) - I can capture it next turn by going RIGHT!\n- If I go LEFT to (2, 4), I'll be at distance 3 from the apple\n\nThis is exactly what I planned last turn. Going DOWN to (3, 3) sets me up perfectly to capture the apple at (4, 3) on my next move.\n\n**Checking the path:**\n- (3, 3) is clearly empty on the board\n- The apple at (4, 3) is still there and available\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (6, 8) - very far from this apple, so no immediate competition\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving to (3, 3), move RIGHT to (4, 3) to capture the apple and gain a point!\n\nDOWN",

I wanted to head towards the apple at (4, 0), and moving DOWN to (4, 2) puts me on the direct path. From (4, 2), I can continue DOWN to (4, 1) and then (4, 0) to capture that apple, assuming the path remains clear.\n\n**Checking the path ahead:**\n- (4, 2): Empty on the board\n- (4, 1): Empty on the board  \n- (4, 0): Has an apple marked with 'A'\n\nThis looks like a clear path to another apple!\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (4, 0).

This will give me 2 points total and keep me growing while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\n**Current situation assessment:**\nThe enemy snake is concentrated in the upper portion of the board and along the right side.

UP - Would move to (4, 9) - This appears to be empty - SAFE\n2. DOWN - Would move to (4, 7) - This appears to be empty - SAFE\n3. LEFT - Would move to (3, 8) - There's a 'T' here which is part of the enemy snake - INVALID (would die)\n4. RIGHT - Would move to (5, 8) - This is part of my own body - INVALID (would die)\n\n# Decision Making\nI can only move UP or DOWN safely. Looking at my objectives:\n\nThe apple at (1, 8) is still closest horizontally, but I can't move directly left because the enemy snake's body is at (3, 8).\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 9), I can potentially try to navigate around the top to reach the apple at (1, 8), but this is a longer path.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 7), I could:\n1. Eventually try to reach the apple at (1, 8) by going down and around\n2. Head toward the bottom apples at (4, 0) or (8, 0)\n3. Consider the apple at (7, 5) which is closer than the bottom apples\n\nLooking at the board state, moving DOWN seems more strategic. It gives me more open space and flexibility in my next moves, whereas moving UP might lead to more confined spaces with both snakes' bodies.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving DOWN to (4, 7), I'll have multiple options. I could continue downward to eventually reach the apple at (4, 0), or I could try to navigate toward the apple at (7, 5) by moving right and down. I'll need to be careful of my own body parts and ensure I don't trap myself.\n\nDOWN",

This is the most direct path to guaranteed points.\n2. **LEFT to (3, 2)**: This moves me away from the apple and toward a more congested area where my own body is located.\n3. **RIGHT to (5, 2)**: This also moves me away from the apple and closer to where the enemy snake has body segments.\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nThe enemy snake (Snake #1) is currently at (4, 7) and heavily concentrated in the upper portion of the board. By continuing DOWN, I'm moving further away from potential conflicts while securing an apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (4, 1) is clearly the optimal choice. It:\n- Keeps me on track to capture the apple at (4, 0) next turn\n- Maintains safe distance from the enemy snake\n- Follows the successful strategy I established\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving to (4, 1), continue DOWN to (4, 0) to capture the apple. This will give me my second point. After that, I should reassess the board and consider either going for the apple at (8, 0) or (9, 1), depending on enemy snake movement and safety.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT - Would move to (6, 7) - This appears to be empty - VALID\n\n# Decision Making\nI have two valid moves: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nLet's think about which is better strategically:\n- If I move RIGHT to (6, 7), I'd be moving toward the right side of the board where I have a lot of my body already.\n- If I move DOWN to (5, 6), I'd be opening up more space in the middle of the board.\n\nLooking at nearby apples, the apple at (7, 5) is most accessible. Moving DOWN would actually help me get closer to this apple by creating a path downward.\n\nThe DOWN move gives me a clearer path toward the apple at (7, 5) and avoids getting trapped against my own body segments that are more concentrated on the right side.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving DOWN to (5, 6), I plan to evaluate if I can safely continue moving down and then right toward the apple at (7, 5). I'll need to be careful about planning my route to avoid trapping myself against my own body.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT - Would move to (6, 5) - This appears to be empty - VALID\n\n# Decision Making\nI have two valid options: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nThe closest apple is at (7, 5) which is 2 steps away if I move RIGHT. The other nearby apple is at (5, 2) which is 3 steps down.\n\nIf I move RIGHT:\n- I can then move RIGHT again to reach the apple at (7, 5)\n- This keeps me in the middle of the board with more options\n\nIf I move DOWN:\n- I continue my path toward the apple at (5, 2)\n- But I would need to be careful of getting trapped as I'd be heading toward a corner with parts of my body above me\n\nThe RIGHT move seems more advantageous as it:\n1. Leads to the closest apple\n2. Keeps me in an open area of the board\n3. Gives me more flexibility for future moves\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving RIGHT to (6, 5), I plan to move RIGHT again to reach the apple at (7, 5). After collecting this apple, I'll need to be careful not to trap myself against my body parts in the upper-right area of the board. I should plan a path that allows me to move toward other apples like the one at (5, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

Safe move.\n- DOWN to (6, -1): This would be outside the board boundary at y=-1. NOT safe - would hit wall.\n- LEFT to (5, 0): This is where my body segment is (my previous head position). NOT safe - would hit myself.\n- RIGHT to (7, 0): Looking at the board, this appears empty. Safe move.\n\nSo I have two safe options: UP or RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 0):** This continues my direct path toward the apple at (8, 0). From (7, 0), I would need just 1 more move to reach the apple and score a point. The path looks completely clear.\n\n**UP to (6, 1):** This would take me away from my current apple target at (8, 0). While it's safe, it's not strategically optimal since I'm so close to securing the point.\n\n**Enemy snake consideration:**\nSnake #1 is at (6, 5) in the middle area, moving around that region. They're not threatening my path along the bottom row to the apple at (8, 0).\n\n**Apple priority:**\n- Apple at (8, 0): Just 1 move away if I continue RIGHT - this should be my immediate priority\n- Apple at (9, 1): Could be my next target after collecting (8, 0)\n- Other apples are much further away\n\n**Decision:**\nContinuing RIGHT is clearly the optimal choice. I'm executing a successful plan to collect the apple at (8, 0), and I'm almost there. No reason to abandon this winning strategy when I'm one move away from scoring.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (7, 0), continue RIGHT to (8, 0) to collect the apple. Then consider going UP to (8, 1) and RIGHT to (9, 1) for the next apple, while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position.\n\nRIGHT",

This creates a more direct path to my target.\n\n# Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving LEFT to (5, 4), I'll plan to move DOWN on the next turn to get to (5, 3), then continue to (5, 2) to collect the apple. I need to be careful not to trap myself against my own body while navigating.\n\nLEFT",

NOT safe - would hit the wall  \n- LEFT to (8, 0): Looking at the board, this shows 'T' which represents my body. NOT safe - would hit myself\n\nWait, let me re-examine this more carefully. Looking at the board state:\n```\n 0 . . . . T T T T T 0\n```\n\nAt y=0, I see my snake body occupies positions (4,0) through (8,0), and I'm the head at (9,0). So moving LEFT to (8,0) would indeed hit my own body.\n\nThis is a critical situation - I appear to be completely boxed in! All four directions seem blocked:\n- UP: Into my body at (9,1)\n- DOWN: Into wall \n- RIGHT: Into wall\n- LEFT: Into my body at (8,0)\n\nWait, let me double-check the body positions from the given data:\nMy body is at: [(9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)]\n\nSo (8, 0) is indeed occupied by my body, and (9, 1) is also occupied by my body.\n\nThis appears to be a losing position where I've trapped myself in the corner. However, I must make a move, so I need to choose the least harmful option.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - sometimes the visual board and the coordinate system can be confusing.

NOT safe - would hit myself\n- DOWN: Would go to (9, -1) which is outside the board. NOT safe - would hit the wall\n- RIGHT: Would go to (10, 0) which is outside the board. NOT safe - would hit the wall  \n- LEFT to (8, 0): Looking at the board, this shows 'T' which represents my body. NOT safe - would hit myself\n\nWait, let me re-examine this more carefully. Looking at the board state:\n```\n 0 . . . . T T T T T 0\n```\n\nAt y=0, I see my snake body occupies positions (4,0) through (8,0), and I'm the head at (9,0). So moving LEFT to (8,0) would indeed hit my own body.\n\nThis is a critical situation - I appear to be completely boxed in! All four directions seem blocked:\n- UP: Into my body at (9,1)\n- DOWN: Into wall \n- RIGHT: Into wall\n- LEFT: Into my body at (8,0)\n\nWait, let me double-check the body positions from the given data:\nMy body is at: [(9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)]\n\nSo (8, 0) is indeed occupied by my body, and (9, 1) is also occupied by my body.\n\nThis appears to be a losing position where I've trapped myself in the corner. However, I must make a move, so I need to choose the least harmful option.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - sometimes the visual board and the coordinate system can be confusing. Let me trust the coordinate data more than my interpretation of the visual.\n\nGiven that I must move and all options seem blocked, I'll choose UP as it's the direction that would typically give me the most space to work with if I'm misreading the situation.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** If I survive this move, I need to be much more careful about not boxing myself into corners and always maintain escape routes.\n\nUP",
