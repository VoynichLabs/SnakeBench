The enemy snake and walls are relatively far away, so our immediate concerns are our own body and positioning relative to the apples.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\u2022 (0,9) in the top\u2010left corner is promising. From our head at (2,8), we\u2019re 2 units to the right (x difference = 2) and 1 unit down (y difference = -1) from that apple.\n\u2022 The others are farther away.\n\nFrom our head at (2,8), our available safe moves are:\n\u2022 UP \u2192 (2,9), which is on the top edge and free.\n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 (1,8), which is open and moves us toward the (0,9) apple.\n\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) is safe, but does not lead directly toward an apple.\n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (2,7) is off\u2010limits (occupied by our own body).\n\nEither UP or LEFT would be acceptable. However, moving LEFT takes us directly toward the (0,9) apple because from (1,8) the apple at (0,9) is only one move diagonally away. So, by choosing LEFT this turn, we set ourselves up to approach that apple in the next moves.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n\u2022 If we move LEFT to (1,8), we can then assess whether to go UP (to (1,9)) or LEFT (to (0,8)) and eventually reach the apple at (0,9) safely. We\u2019ll keep monitoring our surroundings for any potential self-collision as our body follows.\n\nThus, our next move is: LEFT."
