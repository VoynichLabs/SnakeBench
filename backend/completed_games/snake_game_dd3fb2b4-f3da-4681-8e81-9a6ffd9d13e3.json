If I move left, I'll be at (3, 5), which is a good starting point to move down towards the apple.\n\nHowever, now that I think about it, moving left won't actually get me closer to the apple. It'll just put me in a slightly safer position. I need to think about my next move in terms of getting closer to the apple.\n\nHmmm... I could try moving down instead. That would at least get me closer to the apple. But I need to make sure I'm not moving into the enemy snake's territory.\n\nWait a minute... I have a body part at (5, 5) and the enemy snake is at (5, 8). If I move down, I won't be going towards the enemy snake. I'll actually be moving away from it.\n\nAlright, I've got a clear path down. I'll move down and see how that goes. Maybe next turn I can try to move left to get closer to the apple.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN.",
