No collisions with board edges or enemy snake.\n2. **DOWN**: (4, 4) - Safe. No collisions with board edges or enemy snake.\n3. **LEFT**: (3, 5) - Safe. No collisions with board edges or enemy snake.\n4. **RIGHT**: (5, 5) - This is an apple! Safe move that gains me 1 point.\n\nAll four moves are safe since I'm a single segment with no body to collide with.\n\n**Apple Proximity Analysis:**\n\nClosest apples to my current position (4, 5):\n- (5, 5) - Distance 1 (directly RIGHT) \u2713 Has an apple!\n- (4, 1) - Distance 4 (directly DOWN)\n- (0, 6) - Distance ~4.5 away\n- (6, 0) - Distance ~6.3 away\n- (1, 0) - Distance ~6.4 away\n\n**Strategic Reasoning:**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 5) is an obvious choice because:\n1. I immediately collect an apple, gaining my first point\n2. It's a free apple with no risk\n3. Growing to 2 segments opens up more strategic options\n4. The enemy snake at (6, 3) is not a threat this turn\n5. After eating this apple, I'll be positioned well to pursue the apple at (4, 1) below me\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (5, 5), continue targeting the apple at (4, 1) by moving downward. This area has multiple apples clustered (4, 1), (6, 0), and (1, 0), so growing early gives me flexibility to collect them.

I should focus on collecting apples and maintaining my lead.\n\n**Optimal Choice:**\nDOWN continues my direct path toward (4, 1) and maintains flexibility. This is the most direct approach to the closest apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Turns:**\n1. Continue pursuing (4, 1): DOWN this turn, then LEFT, then DOWN to collect\n2. After collecting (4, 1), reassess board state and pursue next closest apple\n3. Watch enemy snake - it's currently constrained near the bottom-left corner\n4. Prioritize apple collection to extend my lead while maintaining safety\n\nDOWN",

This keeps me ahead in the score race and positions me well for the next few moves.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue moving left to collect apples at (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0). Maintain distance from enemy. Currently winning 2-1, so focus on safe apple collection while monitoring enemy position to avoid collisions.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy successfully moved LEFT to (1, 0) as predicted and collected an apple there.\n\n**Safety Analysis - All Directions:**\n\n1. **UP (2, 2)**: Empty cell. Safe. \u2713\n2. **DOWN (2, 0)**: Enemy body occupies this (they moved from (2,0) so it's now empty after their movement, but let me reconsider - the body at (2,0) was from the previous turn. After enemy moves LEFT, they are now at (1,0) with body [(2,0), (3,0)] still extending. So (2,0) is occupied by enemy body). DIES. \u274c\n3. **LEFT (1, 1)**: Apple here! And no collision with enemy who is at (1, 0). Safe. \u2713\n4. **RIGHT (3, 1)**: My own body. DIES. \u274c\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nGoing LEFT to (1, 1):\n- Collects an apple immediately! This breaks the tie.\n- The enemy is at (1, 0), directly below. No collision risk.\n- After eating this apple, I'll have 3 apples vs enemy's 2.\n- Strong positioning to continue collecting the cluster: (0, 0), (0, 6), etc.\n- Maintains offensive momentum.\n\nGoing UP to (2, 2):\n- Safe but doesn't collect any apple.\n- Moves away from the nearby apple at (1, 1).\n- Puts me at a disadvantage as the score is tied.\n- Less strategic.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nEnemy is at (1, 0) with body extending to (3, 0). They likely will:\n- Move UP to (1, 1)? But that apple is where I'm going... we'd have a head-on collision.\n- Move LEFT to (0, 0)? Another apple there.\n- Move RIGHT back? Possible but seems inefficient.\n\nActually, wait. If both the enemy and I move to (1, 1) simultaneously, we'd have a head-on collision and both die. But that would be bad for me since the enemy is tied in score. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, with a head-on collision at (1, 1) when scores are tied 2-2, both would die simultaneously and it's a draw. However, I'm ahead in potential if I can safely eat that apple. The enemy might move differently - they could go LEFT to (0, 0) or UP to (1, 1). \n\nGoing LEFT to (1, 1) is still my best move because:\n1. It's an apple\n2. Even if enemy moves there too (head-on collision), we're tied, but I'm betting they might go a different direction\n3. It's a calculated risk with good upside\n\n**Long-term plan:** Collect the apple cluster on the left side: (1, 1) \u2192 (0, 0) \u2192 eventually work toward other apples. Maintain distance from enemy and watch for opportunities to separate. Currently tied, so aggressive apple collection is warranted to get ahead.\n\nLEFT",

That's bad.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nGoing **LEFT to (0, 6)** with apple:\n- High collision risk if enemy moves UP (both die, currently tied at 3 apples each)\n- Not worth the risk - head-on collision would end the game in a draw or worse\n\nGoing **UP to (1, 7)**:\n- Safe from collision (enemy will be at (0, 6) if they move UP)\n- Good position\n- Moves toward (2, 7) apple\n- Keeps distance from enemy\n- Multiple safe follow-up moves available\n\nGoing **RIGHT to (2, 6)**:\n- Also safe\n- Moves toward upper-right apple cluster\n- More direct path to (8, 6) and (8, 7)\n\n**Analysis:**\nDespite the tempting apple at (0, 6), the collision risk with the enemy is too high. Moving UP is the safer choice that keeps me alive and maintains strategic positioning. I should focus on the right side of the board where there are multiple apples and less direct competition.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Continue moving UP and RIGHT to position myself toward (2, 7), (8, 6), (8, 7)\n- Avoid the left side where the enemy is concentrated\n- Build a scoring lead through the right-side apple cluster\n- Stay at least 2 moves ahead of the enemy to avoid traps\n\nUP",

Less efficient than UP.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUP is clearly the best move. I collect an apple immediately, take the lead in scoring, and maintain good positioning for future apple collection. The enemy is far away on the left side, so there's no collision risk.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\nAfter eating the apple at (3, 8), I should continue upward toward (4, 9) if the path is clear, or pivot right to pursue other apples.

Safe move. Positions me closer to (4, 9) and (5, 9) apples.\n2. **DOWN (3, 7)**: My own body! DIES. \u274c\n3. **LEFT (2, 8)**: Empty cell. Safe. But moves away from nearby apples.\n4. **RIGHT (4, 8)**: Empty cell. Safe move. Moves closer to the (4, 9) apple.\n\n**Elimination:** DOWN is eliminated (self-collision).\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n- **UP (3, 9)**: Moves to the top row. Gets me closer to the (4, 9) and (5, 9) apples on the next turn. This is a strong position as I can grab either apple next turn by moving right.\n\n- **RIGHT (4, 8)**: Also moves closer to (4, 9). This move gets me directly below (4, 9), positioning me to eat it next turn by moving UP.\n\n- **LEFT (2, 8)**: Moves away from high-value apples. Not strategic.\n\n**Comparing UP vs RIGHT:**\n- RIGHT gets me to (4, 8), directly below the (4, 9) apple\n- UP gets me to (3, 9), on the top row but not directly below either apple\n- RIGHT is slightly more efficient for targeting (4, 9) next turn\n\nHowever, UP gives me more flexibility - from (3, 9) I could move RIGHT to either (4, 9) or (5, 9) depending on board state.\n\nLooking at enemy position: Enemy head is at (1, 8). The enemy is still on the left side. Moving RIGHT or UP keeps maximum distance from the enemy.\n\n**Best Move: RIGHT**\nThis positions me directly below the (4, 9) apple, allowing me to grab it next turn with an UP move. This maintains my scoring lead and keeps me moving toward high-value apples while staying safe.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\nFrom (4, 8), move UP to grab (4, 9). Then reassess whether to continue right toward (5, 9) or angle toward the (8, 6)/(8, 7) cluster. Enemy is still left-side confined, so I have freedom to explore the right side of the board. Continue building lead before turn 150.\n\nRIGHT",

While moving RIGHT gets us closer to the apples at column\u202f8, the collision risk makes it less favorable compared to the safer upward move, which also positions us to head toward the top row and then proceed rightward without immediate danger.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP  \n\nUP",

It:\n- Keeps me alive\n- Moves me toward the valuable apple cluster (8, 6) and (8, 7)\n- Maintains safe distance from the enemy\n- Positions me well for the next several moves\n\nFrom (6, 9), I can continue RIGHT to (7, 9), then target (8, 7) or (8, 6).
