So, **RIGHT is invalid**.\n\n### Safe Moves:\n- UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Closer to Apples**: The closest apple is (7,6) or (5,3).\n  - From (8,7), moving **DOWN** to (8,6) is one step closer to (7,6).\n  - Moving **LEFT** to (7,7) is not directly closer to any apple.\n  - Moving **UP** to (8,8) is away from apples.\n\n- **Avoiding Traps**: Moving **DOWN** to (8,6) is a straightforward move that keeps options open and reduces distance to the nearest apple.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Turn 1**: Move DOWN to (8,6) to eat apple at (7,6) if it exists (it does).\n- **Turn 2**: After eating, the snake will have a body at (8,7). Now, prioritize moving toward (5,3) or (4,1) while avoiding the enemy.\n- **Turn 3**: Consider moving diagonally or in a zigzag to avoid the enemy's potential moves.\n\n### Final Decision:\nDOWN\n\n---\n**Final move:** DOWN",

I'm at the bottom edge (y=0), so DOWN would kill me (off the board).\n2. My head is at (7,0), so moving LEFT would take me to (6,0), RIGHT to (8,0), and UP to (7,1).\n3. There are no bodies to worry about yet (both snakes have no body segments).\n4.

The apples at (4,1) and (5,1) are the closest. Moving RIGHT toward (8,0) would take me away from these.\n2. Moving UP to (7,1) would position me better to eventually reach the apples at (4,1) or (5,1).\n3. Moving LEFT to (6,0) would also be toward the apples but keeps me on the bottom edge which might limit future options.\n\n**Enemy Considerations:**\n- Enemy is at (8,7) - far away and not an immediate threat.\n- No risk of head-on collision this turn since we're far apart.\n\n**Best Move:**\nUP to (7,1) is the best choice because:\n1. It moves me toward the general area of the closest apples\n2. It gets me off the bottom edge, giving me more movement options\n3. It doesn't commit me to any particular direction too early\n4. It maintains maximum flexibility for future moves\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFor the next few turns, I should continue moving upward while positioning myself to reach the apples at (4,1) or (5,1).

Less immediate reward but safer if enemy moves UP.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moves away from apples.

This is a mistake in the analysis\u2014**neither UP nor LEFT moves the head**. The head is at (8,6), so:\n   - **UP**: (7,6) \u2192 Valid (no overlap).\n   - **LEFT**: (7,6) \u2192 Valid (no overlap).\n   - **DOWN/Right are invalid** (off-board).\n   - **No move changes the head position**\u2014this is impossible.

This is a **dead-end**\u2014the snake would die by moving backward into its own body.\n\n#### **Correction:**\nThe head is at **(8,6)**. The tail is at **(7,6)**. Moving **UP** or **LEFT** would place the head at **(7,6)**, which is the tail\u2019s position. This is a **backward move**, which kills the snake. The only valid moves are **DOWN** and **RIGHT**, but both are off-board. **No valid moves exist**\u2014this is a **deadlock**.\n\n#### **Re-evaluation:**\nThe snake is stuck.

Alternatively, the snake can **turn 90 degrees** to avoid immediate death, but the only valid moves are **UP** or **LEFT**, which are invalid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The snake is **trapped** and will die unless it eats an apple. The only way to survive is to **move toward (8,2)** by **DOWN**, but that is off-board. The snake must **grow by eating (8,2)** by moving **DOWN** to (9,6) and then **LEFT** to (8,6), but this is impossible in one move.\n\n**Final Decision:** The snake is **doomed** unless the apple is eaten. The only valid move is to **move toward (8,2)** by **DOWN**, but this is invalid. The snake must **choose a move that avoids immediate death**\u2014but none exist. The snake must **eat (8,2)** by moving **DOWN** to (9,6) and then **LEFT** to (8,6), but this is impossible.\n\n**Long-term strategy note to future self:**\n- **Do not let the snake get trapped**\u2014always leave at least two safe moves.\n- **If stuck, prioritize eating the closest apple**\u2014even if it requires a risky move.\n- **Monitor enemy direction**\u2014if enemy expands, secure apples faster.\n- **Never ignore an apple** if it is reachable in one move.\n\n**Final move:** **DOWN** (forced to attempt eating (8,2) despite off-board risk).\n\n---\n**UP**",

Moving **UP** or **LEFT** would place the head at **(7,6)**, which is the tail\u2019s position\u2014**immediate death** (backward move).\n- **DOWN**: **(9,6)** \u2192 **Invalid** (off-board).\n- **RIGHT**: **(9,6)** \u2192 **Invalid** (off-board).\n- **No valid moves exist**\u2014the snake is **trapped**.\n\n#### **Apple Proximity:**\n- **(8,2)** is **2 steps down** from the head. To reach it, the snake must move **DOWN** to **(9,6)**, but that is off-board. The only way to eat it is to **grow** by moving toward it, but the head cannot move there safely.\n- **(2,5)** is farther but also unreachable without risking death.\n\n#### **Enemy Threat:**\n- Snake #0 is expanding toward **(2,1)** and **(3,1)**. If it moves **UP** or **LEFT**, it may block **(2,5)** or **(3,1)**.\n\n#### **Move Evaluation:**\n- **No safe moves exist**\u2014the snake is **doomed** unless it eats an apple. The only way to survive is to **move toward (8,2)** by **DOWN**, but that is invalid. The snake must **grow by eating (8,2)** via a risky path, but no valid single-move path exists.\n\n#### **Conclusion:**\nThe snake is **trapped and will die** unless it finds a way to eat an apple. The only possible move is to **attempt eating (8,2)** by moving **DOWN**, but this is invalid. The snake must **choose a move that avoids immediate death**, but none exist. The snake must **prioritize survival** by moving **UP** (even though it risks death), as it is the only move that does not immediately kill it (though it may still die later).\n\n---\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note:**\n- **Never let the snake get trapped**\u2014always leave at least two safe moves.\n- **If stuck, prioritize eating the closest apple**\u2014even if it requires a risky move.\n- **Monitor enemy direction**\u2014if expanding, secure apples faster.\n- **Avoid moving backward**\u2014it is the fastest way to die.\n- **If no safe moves exist, choose the least dangerous one** (even if it risks death).\n\n---\n**Final move:** **DOWN** *(forced to attempt eating (8,2) despite off-board risk, but no valid alternative exists.)*",

Next move could be **UP to (0, 3)** (off-board, invalid) or **RIGHT to (2, 4)** (collision with tail) or **DOWN to (2, 2)** or **LEFT to (1, 2)**.\n\n   **Key threat:** If Snake #0 moves **LEFT to (1, 2)**, it will be adjacent to your head (7, 9) or body (7, 8). No immediate collision risk yet, but we must avoid expanding into its path.\n\n3. **Safe Moves:**\n   - **UP:** (7, 8) \u2192 Valid (no collision, no off-board).\n   - **DOWN:** (7, 10) \u2192 Off-board \u2192 **INVALID**.\n   - **LEFT:** (6, 9) \u2192 Valid.\n   - **RIGHT:** (8, 9) \u2192 Valid.\n\n4. **Apple Proximity & Enemy Threat:**\n   - Closest apple: (2, 5) (distance = 5 steps, but Snake #0 is expanding toward it).\n   - Snake #0\u2019s next move is uncertain, but prioritize moves that avoid its expansion.\n   - If Snake #0 moves **LEFT to (1, 2)**, avoid moving toward (1, 9) or (1, 2) proximity.\n\n5. **Move Evaluation:**\n   - **UP:** Moves head to (7, 8). Keeps body safe and avoids Snake #0\u2019s potential expansion. Safe and neutral.\n   - **LEFT:** Moves head to (6, 9). Further from (2, 5) but still safe. Less optimal than UP.\n   - **RIGHT:** Moves head to (8, 9). Safe but no immediate benefit.\n\n   **Best move:** **UP** to (7, 8). This keeps the snake oriented toward the board\u2019s edge and avoids Snake #0\u2019s potential expansion.\n\n---\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:**\n- **Turn 14:** If Snake #0 hasn\u2019t blocked (2, 5), move toward it (e.g., UP to (6, 8) or LEFT to (6, 9)). Prioritize safety and avoid Snake #0\u2019s path.\n- **Turn 15:** If (2, 5) is safe, move aggressively toward it. Otherwise, focus on (5, 3) or (1, 9).\n- **General:** Always leave at least two safe follow-up moves. Avoid moving into Snake #0\u2019s likely path.\n\n---\n**UP**",
