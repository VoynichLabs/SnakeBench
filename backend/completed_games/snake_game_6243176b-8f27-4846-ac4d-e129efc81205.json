            "rationale": "It seems there is a discrepancy in the board state and the last move information. The last move information states the head is at (5, 5), but the current board state shows the head at (5, 4). Additionally, the apple at (5, 2) is already consumed, as it is not listed in the current apples.\n\n### Current Analysis:\n- **Head Position**: (5, 4)\n- **Body**: None (initial state)\n- **Apples**: (0, 6), (7, 9), (6, 1), (4, 4)\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Head at (5, 3), Body at [(4, 3)]\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Avoid Collision**: Ensure the next move does not lead to a collision with the wall, enemy snake, or myself.\n2. **Target Closest Apple**: Identify the closest apple to the current position and plan a path to reach it.\n3. **Avoid Enemy Snake**: Be cautious of the enemy snake's position and potential movements.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n- **UP**: Move to (5, 5). This is a valid move and does not lead to any immediate collision.\n- **DOWN**: Move to (5, 3). This is invalid as it would collide with the enemy snake's head at (5, 3).\n- **LEFT**: Move to (4, 4). This is a valid move and leads directly to the apple at (4, 4).\n- **RIGHT**: Move to (6, 4). This is a valid move but does not lead directly to any apple.\n\n### Decision:\nThe most efficient move is to go LEFT to reach the closest apple at (4, 4).\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**",
