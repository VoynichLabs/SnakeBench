Here's my rationale for the next move:\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\n\n- **Apples:** (4, 7), (1, 2), (2, 9), (3, 8), (1, 1).\n- **Snake #0:** Head at (2, 8), body extending down and right.\n- **My position:** (6, 2).\n\nWith my head now at (6, 2), I'm closer to the apple at (2, 9), which I can reach in one move. The apple at (3, 8) is also a viable option next turn. However, I need to avoid Snake #0\u2019s territory, especially since their body might block access to some areas.\n\n### Next Move Strategy:\n\n1. **If I go UP:**\n\t- I could collect the apple at (3, 8) and position myself closer to a safe zone, avoiding Snake #0 for a bit.\n\t- Risks: Moving further into contested territory.\n2. **If I go RIGHT:**\n\t- I can grab the apple at (2, 9), securing another point before deciding whether to retreat or push forward.\n\t- This move also opens options to explore the top half of the board or loop back toward (4, 7).\n3. **If I go LEFT:**\n\t- This moves me away from Snake #0 but risks losing momentum toward the central apples.\n4. **If I go DOWN:**\n\t- This puts me at risk of direct confrontation with Snake #0 and doesn\u2019t align with my long-term strategy of advancing upward.\n\n### Decision:\n\nI\u2019ll move **RIGHT** to (7, 2) to collect the apple at (2, 9).\n\nNext turn, I\u2019ll assess the board again, considering whether to climb toward the safer (3, 8) apple or reposition further up to avoid Snake #0. I\u2019ll also watch for opportunities to cut off Snake #0\u2019s growth or force them into a confrontation.\n\n**END NEXT MOVE INFORMATION**\nDecided next move: RIGHT.",

This could be useful if the enemy snake moves in an unexpected way.\n- **LEFT**: Moving left could potentially allow you to catch up with another apple if it's to your left, but it doesn't directly address the apple at (1, 2).\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right might be useful if there's another apple to your right, but it's not the closest one.\n\n**Think-Aloud:**\n\nOkay, I need to reach the apple at (1, 2) and grow my snake.

Accessing this apple requires immediate action.\n- The apple at (1, 1) is still highly valuable but risky due to its proximity to Snake #0.

If Snake #0 moves up, this apple becomes practically mine. However, if they move elsewhere, it could become a contested spot.\n- The apple at (4, 7) is slightly riskier but still achievable this turn, especially if Snake #0 moves southward. This would make it a solid choice if (1, 1) is contested.\n- The apple at (2, 9) is technically reachable but would be a stretch given the short time and potential risks. I'll deem this a backup option.\n- The apple at (5, 6) is currently too far out of reach, so I\u2019ll table it for now.\n- Snake #0's body starting at (3, 4) is pointed downward, suggesting they might move south. If they do, this opens up opportunities for (1, 1) and (4, 7).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nUnless Snake #0's move alters the dynamics significantly, I\u2019ll focus on the lower-risk, higher-reward options:\n\n- If Snake #0 moves up, I\u2019ll grab (1, 1).\n- If Snake #0 moves elsewhere, I\u2019ll aim for (4, 7).\n- As a fallback, I\u2019ll consider (2, 9) if the above options are blocked.\n\n**END THINKING OUT LOUD**\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n\n**UP** to (9, 7).\nThis keeps me flexible and ready to adapt to Snake #0's moves while prioritizing the apple at (1, 1) as my main target.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Snake #0 is at (3, 3) with their body starting at (3, 4). They haven't moved yet this turn, so their next direction could influence my decision significantly.\n- Apples are temptingly scattered: (4, 7), (1, 2), (2, 9), (1, 1), (5, 6). I'll prioritize based on accessibility and risk.\n\n**Accessibility and Risk Assessment:**\n\n- The apple at (1, 1) is very accessible, requiring very little movement. If Snake #0 moves up, this apple becomes practically mine. However, if they move elsewhere, it could become a contested spot.\n- The apple at (4, 7) is slightly riskier but still achievable this turn, especially if Snake #0 moves southward. This would make it a solid choice if (1, 1) is contested.\n- The apple at (2, 9) is technically reachable but would be a stretch given the short time and potential risks. I'll deem this a backup option.\n- The apple at (5, 6) is currently too far out of reach, so I\u2019ll table it for now.\n- Snake #0's body starting at (3, 4) is pointed downward, suggesting they might move south. If they do, this opens up opportunities for (1, 1) and (4, 7).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nUnless Snake #0's move alters the dynamics significantly, I\u2019ll focus on the lower-risk, higher-reward options:\n\n- If Snake #0 moves up, I\u2019ll grab (1, 1).\n- If Snake #0 moves elsewhere, I\u2019ll aim for (4, 7).\n- As a fallback, I\u2019ll consider (2, 9) if the above options are blocked.\n\n**END THINKING OUT LOUD**\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n\n**UP** to (9, 7).\nThis keeps me flexible and ready to adapt to Snake #0's moves while prioritizing the apple at (1, 1) as my main target.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Snake #0 is at (3, 3) with their body starting at (3, 4). They haven't moved yet this turn, so their next direction could influence my decision significantly.\n- Apples are temptingly scattered: (4, 7), (1, 2), (2, 9), (1, 1), (5, 6). I'll prioritize based on accessibility and risk.\n\n**Accessibility and Risk Assessment:**\n\n- The apple at (1, 1) is very accessible, requiring very little movement. If Snake #0 moves up, this apple becomes practically mine. However, if they move elsewhere, it could become a contested spot.\n- The apple at (4, 7) is slightly riskier but still achievable this turn, especially if Snake #0 moves southward. This would make it a solid choice if (1, 1) is contested.\n- The apple at (2, 9) is technically reachable but would be a stretch given the short time and potential risks. I'll deem this a backup option.\n- The apple at (5, 6) is currently too far out of reach, so I\u2019ll table it for now.\n- Snake #0's body starting at (3, 4) is pointed downward, suggesting they might move south. If they do, this opens up opportunities for (1, 1) and (4, 7).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nUnless Snake #0's move alters the dynamics significantly, I\u2019ll focus on the lower-risk, higher-reward options:\n\n- If Snake #0 moves up, I\u2019ll grab (1, 1).\n- If Snake #0 moves elsewhere, I\u2019ll aim for (4, 7).\n- As a fallback, I\u2019ll consider (2, 9) if the above options are blocked.\n\n**END THINKING OUT LOUD**\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n\n**UP** to (9, 7).\nThis keeps me flexible and ready to adapt to Snake #0's moves while prioritizing the apple at (1, 1) as my main target.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

If they move elsewhere, this apple might be contested.\n- The apple at (4, 7) is still in play but depends on Snake #0's actions.

If they move elsewhere, I'll aim for (4, 7).\n2. **Risk vs. Reward**: Prioritize lower-risk options that maximize growth.\n3. **Avoid dangerous zones**: Stay out of Snake #0's immediate reach.\n\n**Next Move:** I'll move **UP** to (9, 7) to remain flexible for grabbing (1, 1) while monitoring Snake #0's movements.\n\n**END THINKING OUT LOUD**\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n\n**UP** to (9, 7).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Snake #0 is at (3, 3) with their body starting at (3, 4). They haven't moved yet this turn, so their next direction could influence my decision significantly.\n- Apples are temptingly scattered: (4, 7), (1, 2), (2, 9), (1, 1), (5, 6). I'll prioritize based on accessibility and risk.\n\n**Accessibility and Risk Assessment:**\n\n- The apple at (1, 1) is very accessible, requiring very little movement. If Snake #0 moves up, this apple becomes practically mine. However, if they move elsewhere, it could become a contested spot.\n- The apple at (4, 7) is slightly riskier but still achievable this turn, especially if Snake #0 moves southward. This would make it a solid choice if (1, 1) is contested.\n- The apple at (2, 9) is technically reachable but would be a stretch given the short time and potential risks. I'll deem this a backup option.\n- The apple at (5, 6) is currently too far out of reach, so I\u2019ll table it for now.\n- Snake #0's body starting at (3, 4) is pointed downward, suggesting they might move south. If they do, this opens up opportunities for (1, 1) and (4, 7).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nUnless Snake #0's move alters the dynamics significantly, I\u2019ll focus on the lower-risk, higher-reward options:\n\n- If Snake #0 moves up, I\u2019ll grab (1, 1).\n- If Snake #0 moves elsewhere, I\u2019ll aim for (4, 7).\n- As a fallback, I\u2019ll consider (2, 9) if the above options are blocked.\n\n**END THINKING OUT LOUD**\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n\n**UP** to (9, 7).\nThis keeps me flexible and ready to adapt to Snake #0's moves while prioritizing the apple at (1, 1) as my main target.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
