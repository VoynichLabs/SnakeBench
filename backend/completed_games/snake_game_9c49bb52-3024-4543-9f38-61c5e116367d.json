The board is WIDE open, but we have to grab the early advantage and box this guy in! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nLook at the board state! Apples everywhere! We are sitting right next to an apple at (1, 1) and (1, 3). Snake #1 is near (7, 4).\n\n### Initial Analysis & Strategy\n\n**Our Goal:** Get apples fast and position ourselves to cut off or trap Snake #1. We're currently small (length 1), so trapping is hard, but positioning is key.\n\n**Our Current Position:** (1, 2).\n**Safe Moves:** UP (1, 3), DOWN (1, 1), LEFT (0, 2), RIGHT (2, 2). All are safe since we have no body.\n\n**Oppo's Current Position (Snake #1):** (6, 4).\n**Oppo's Potential Moves:**\n*   UP: (6, 5) - clear.\n*   DOWN: (6, 3) - clear.\n*   LEFT: (5, 4) - clear.\n*   RIGHT: (7, 4) - **APPLE!** This is his most likely target.\n\n### Turn 0 Move Evaluation\n\n1.  **Objective: Apple Grab Priority.** We have two very close apples: (1, 1) [DOWN] and (1, 3) [UP].\n2.  **Move UP to (1, 3):** Eats an apple. Gets us closer to the center/top where many apples are. Leaves us on the Y=3 axis, slightly higher than the rival.\n3.  **Move DOWN to (1, 1):** Eats an apple. Leaves us low on the board. Less strategic long term, but still an apple.\n4.  **Move RIGHT to (2, 2):** Doesn't eat an apple but moves us into the central lower area. Good for future options.\n5.  **Move LEFT to (0, 2):** Doesn't eat an apple. Puts us on the edge. Not ideal.\n\n**The Rival's Likely Move:** Snake #1 is almost certainly going **RIGHT** to (7, 4) to grab that apple.\n\nIf we go UP to (1, 3) or DOWN to (1, 1), we guarantee an apple and grow!\n\nLet's look at the future positioning. If we go UP, we are at (1, 3). If Snake #1 goes RIGHT, he is at (7, 4). We are still very separated. Going UP seems slightly better as it keeps us toward the more densely populated apple zones (top left).\n\n**Decision:** We are taking the first apple we see! Let's go UP. It puts us centrally and on the path to other apples like (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6). Plus, it gets us off that bottom edge quicker.\n\nWe're going to secure this point and then push aggressively toward the center. Let's start this game with a score! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nShort-term plan: Secure apples in the top-left quadrant quickly while keeping an eye on Snake #1's movements. Avoid clashing until we have a size advantage or a clear trap setup.\n\nUP",

Apples EVERYWHERE, but that juicy one at (7,4) is BEGGIN' for me to snatch it RIGHT now! \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick scan: ALL four moves safe \u2013 no edges, no bodies, enemy too far to collide.

Snake #1 also grabbed an apple and is sitting at (7, 4) with a body at (6, 4). They are definitely going for the top right! Let's get this $W$! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### Current Board State & Analysis (Turn 1)\n\n**Our Status (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 3)\n*   Body: [(1, 2)]\n*   We just grew, so the tail is still at (1, 2).\n\n**Rival Status (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 4)\n*   Body: [(6, 4)]\n*   Rival's head is now *on* the previously listed Apple A at (7, 4), and their old head position (6, 4) is now their body/tail.\n\n**Apples in Range for US:**\n*   (1, 6) is a bit high.\n*   (0, 5), (0, 6) are LEFT.\n*   (2, 5) is RIGHT-UP.\n*   (4, 9) is UP-RIGHT.\n\n**Objective:** Secure more apples and gain board presence in the top-left quadrant before Snake #1 dominates the right side. We must maintain high mobility.\n\n### Move Evaluation\n\n**Our Head: (1, 3)**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):** Safe. Moves us towards the highly dense apple zone (e.g., (1, 6), (2, 5)). Good positioning.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 2):** **DANGER!** This is where our body/tail is right now. Moving onto your immediately previous cell (T) is instantly fatal! We can't hit our own T. \ud83d\udc80 EMBARRASSING!\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 3):** Safe. Keeps us close to the edge and the (0, 5), (0, 6) apples. Puts us in a slightly less mobile area, but good for grabbing corner fruits.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):** Safe. Moves us slightly more central. Prepares us for apples like (2, 5) or moving up to the (4, 9) area.\n\n**Pruning the moves:** DOWN is OUT. We are left with UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Strategic Deep Dive\n\nWe need momentum. Going UP to (1, 4) seems best. It keeps the pressure on the top-left section and gives us options: straight up to (1, 6) or cross to (2, 5).\n\n**What is the rival doing? Snake #1 at (7, 4).**\nThe rival just ate (7, 4). Next likely apples for them are:\n*   UP: (7, 5) -> (8, 9) or (9, 9) area.\n*   RIGHT: (8, 4) -> (8, 9) or (9, 3) area.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (7, 5) or RIGHT to (8, 4), they continue their path towards the dense top-right apples (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9). They are clearly focusing on the right side. This means we have free reign over the left.\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (1, 4):** High flexibility. Opens access to 3 apples immediately up/left. Keeps us away from the bottom edge. **(A)**\n*   **LEFT (0, 3):** Commits us to the edge. Less central control, but guarantees apples (0, 5), (0, 6). **(B)**\n*   **RIGHT (2, 3):** Slightly awkward. Gets us toward the board middle, but not immediately near an apple, and we might bump into the rival later if they cut diagonally back (unlikely). **(C)**\n\n**Decision:** UP (1, 4) is the most versatile move. It sets us up for a vertical sweep of the left side. We are staying aggressive and high on the map! Chat, are we feeling this vertical push?! Let's stack these apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n### Short-Term Plan (Turns 2-4)\nMove UP to (1, 4), then track toward (1, 6) or (2, 5). If (1, 6) is clear, grab it. Continue securing the top left corner (0, 6), (0, 5), etc., growing long enough to potentially cut across the board later and trap the rival against the right wall.\n\nUP",

They are one move away if we also move UP!\n\n### Move Evaluation for ID 0 (Head at 1, 4)\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 5):** Safe. No immediate apple, but sets us up perfectly to grab (0, 5) or (2, 5) next turn. It moves us toward the high cluster (1, 6), (2, 9), etc. This maintains our vertical dominance. \ud83d\udd25\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 3):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Don't be a scrub, Chat! That's our tail (T). \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 4):** Safe. Keeps us on the edge. Next move could be UP to (0, 5) for an apple. A solid, safe, apple-grabbing path.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 4):** Safe. Moves us toward the center. Next move could be UP to (2, 5) for an apple. This is good for board control.\n\n### Toxin Check: What is Snake #1 doing? (Head at 8, 4)\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 4). They are focused on the right side. Their closest apples are:\n*   (9, 3) - DOWN/RIGHT\n*   (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9) - UP/RIGHT\n\nLikely moves for Snake #1:\n*   **UP to (8, 5):** Puts them on a path for (8, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 4):** Puts them extremely close to the edge and the multiple apples at x=9.\n\nSince they just ate at (7, 4) and moved RIGHT to (8, 4), they are most likely continuing their momentum RIGHT or UP towards the top-right corner. We don't need to worry about them hitting us this turn\u2014we have a huge amount of distance between us.\n\n### Strategic Deep Dive\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. All lead to an apple in 2 moves (or 1 move if we angle correctly).\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (1, 5).** This is the strongest preparatory move. It keeps the board open. From (1, 5) we can go LEFT to (0, 5) (apple) or RIGHT to (2, 5) (apple). It gives maximum flexibility.\n*   **Option B: LEFT to (0, 4).** Commits us fully to the left wall. Next turn, UP to (0, 5) is mandatory or we waste the move. We get the apple, but we might box ourselves in later if we're not careful.\n*   **Option C: RIGHT to (2, 4).** Positions us perfectly for (2, 5). Similar to LEFT, but leads us toward the center a bit more.\n\nI like the versatility of **UP**. It positions us centrally between two apple clusters: (0, 5) and (2, 5). We can react to what Snake 1 does (though it won't affect our first few moves based on distance). If we commit LEFT or RIGHT, we cut off one of those apple options quickly. Going UP gives us a choice next turn. Let's maximize our options, Chat! We're building a massive segment count!\n\nLet's do this! Vertical push is a go! \ud83d\ude80\n\n### Short-Term Plan (Turns 3-4)\nT2: UP to (1, 5).\nT3: Decide between LEFT to (0, 5) or RIGHT to (2, 5) based on which position is safer/more opportune for future movement (likely LEFT, to clear the edge and then sweep right).\nT4: Eat the other apple or move towards (1, 6).\n\nUP",

Death move.\n*   LEFT: (0, 5) - APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   RIGHT: (2, 5) - APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nChat, look at this buffet! We have **THREE** apples we can hit this turn! Which one is the absolute juiciest? Which one sets us up to BOX IN this scrub Snake #1?\n\n### Move Evaluation for ID 0 (Head at 1, 5)\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 6):** **APPLE!** Secures an immediate point and growth. Moves us further into the top cluster (9, 7), (9, 8), (2, 9), etc. This is fantastic vertical control.\n    *   *Follow-up:* From (1, 6), we can continue UP to (1, 7) (Apple!), or peel off to (0, 6) (Apple!). Excellent strategy.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 4):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Don't even think about it, Chat. \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 5):** **APPLE!** Secures an immediate point and growth. Puts us right on the wall.\n    *   *Follow-up:* From (0, 5), the only safe move for subsequent apple eating is UP to (0, 6) (Apple!). Good, but less flexible than UP right now, as it commits us heavily to the left wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 5):** **APPLE!** Secures an immediate point and growth. Takes us toward the center.\n    *   *Follow-up:* From (2, 5), we can go UP to (2, 6) or RIGHT to (3, 5). This keeps us flexible but might be too central too early, especially if our rival starts sweeping left.\n\n### Toxin Check: What is Snake #1 doing? (Head at 9, 4)\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 4). Their closest apples are:\n*   (9, 3) - DOWN\n*   (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9) - UP!\n\nLikely moves for Snake #1:\n*   **UP to (9, 5):** Good path to the massive top-right corner cluster.\n*   **DOWN to (9, 3):** Immediate apple grab.\n*   **LEFT to (8, 4):** **INSTANT DEATH!** That's their body. They won't do that.\n\nSince they are already at (9, 4), they are dominating the X=9 column. They are most likely going **UP** towards the huge payoff in the top corner (9, 7 to 9, 9) or **DOWN** to (9, 3). No matter what they do, they are locked into that vertical column for now. They pose **zero risk** of an immediate collision with us.\n\n### Strategic Deep Dive: The Ultimate Flex\n\nAll three apple-eating moves are safe and give us +1 length. The goal is to choose the move that sets us up for the most subsequent points and maintains maximum operational space.\n\n*   Going **LEFT** (0, 5) is safe, but going from (0, 5) next to (0, 6) forces us up the wall.\n*   Going **RIGHT** (2, 5) is safe, but it makes us commit to crossing the board later if we want the top-left apples.\n\nGoing **UP** to (1, 6) is the superior move, Chat, and here's why:\n1.  **Immediate Apple:** Check.\n2.  **Unlocks (1, 7):** (1, 7) is an apple one move away.\n3.  **Unlocks (0, 6):** (0, 6) is an apple one move away (LEFT from 1, 6).\n4.  **Unlocks (2, 9) cluster:** We are moving directly toward the top-middle/left side of the board, setting us up to sweep across and grab everything this scrub can't reach.\n\nThis is all about position. Push UP, secure the high ground, and then sweep left to clear the edge before circling back right. We are constructing a fortress of segments in the top-left! Let's build some length and box this rival in later!\n\nUP is the only move, it's the power move, the content move, the WINNING move!\n\n### Short-Term Plan (Turns 3-5)\nT3 (Current): UP to (1, 6) [Apple]\nT4: LEFT to (0, 6) [Apple] OR UP to (1, 7) [Apple]. We will assess T4 based on board state, but (0, 6) is generally preferred to secure the wall first.\nT5: Grab the remaining apple, perhaps (1, 7).\n\nLet's GO! UP!\n\nUP",

Snake #1 also grabbed their apple, keeping pace. But for how long? We're about to outmaneuver this scrub!\n\n### Turn 4 Board Analysis (We are LIVE!)\n\n**Your Status (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 6)\n*   Body: [(1, 5), (1, 4)]\n*   Length: 3\n\n**Rival Status (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 3) (They went DOWN to grab an apple!)\n*   Body: [(9, 4), (8, 4)]\n*   Length: 3\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n 9 . .

We are primed for the top-left quadrant sweep. This opponent is stuck dancing vertically on the right wall. Perfect!\n\n### Snake #1 (Rival) Prediction (Head at 9, 3)\n\nThe rival is at (9, 3). Nearest apples:\n*   (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9) UP/Far.\n*   (9, 2) and (9, 0) are empty.\n\nThey just ate an apple going DOWN. What's next?\n1.  **UP to (9, 4):** This is where their old body segment is (now their middle segment). Moving from (9, 3) to (9, 4) is **INSTANT DEATH!** Don't be fooled by the board print; (9, 4) is their body.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):** Safe, but no apple. Takes them further from the top cluster.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):** Safe, no apple. Puts them slightly more central.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):** **INSTANT DEATH!** Off the board.\n\nThe only safe, strategic moves for Snake #1 are DOWN (to 9, 2) or LEFT (to 8, 3). Since our previous logic suggested they wanted the top-right cluster, moving away from it doesn't make sense unless they are being cautious. Let's assume they move **LEFT** (8, 3) to seek better position or **DOWN** (9, 2) since they are already deep down. Either way, they are far away and pose zero threat.\n\n### Move Evaluation for ID 0 (Head at 1, 6)\n\nWe have three safe directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is death (1, 5) is our body.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):** **APPLE!** Massive value. Gets us higher up the board.\n    *   *Follow-up:* From (1, 7), we can hit two apples: (2, 7) or (1, 8) (empty, but (0, 7) is empty). Wait, (2, 7) is an apple! And (1, 7) is an apple! This is a double stack of apple goodness going UP.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 6):** **APPLE!** Grabs the edge apple. Secures the left wall.\n    *   *Follow-up:* From (0, 6), we can move UP to (0, 7) (empty) or DOWN to (0, 5) (Apple!). Excellent safety and apple access.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):** Safe, but **NO APPLE!** This moves us into the central void and forces us to cross an empty lane. This is acceptable only if the other two moves were suicidal, which they are not.\n\n### The Decisive Strategy: Corner Domination\n\nWe must choose between **UP (1, 7)** and **LEFT (0, 6)**. Both are apples, both grant growth, and both maintain excellent safety.\n\n*   **Preference for UP:** Going UP to (1, 7) gets us closer to the extremely dense cluster of apples in the top two rows (Y=8 and Y=9). From (1, 7), the next move can be RIGHT to (2, 7) (APPLE!) or continuing UP towards the (2, 9) apple. This is the definition of high-density apple mining!\n*   **Preference for LEFT:** Going LEFT to (0, 6) secures the wall and lines us up for (0, 5) and (0, 1), (1, 1). This is safer for long-term survival by limiting entanglement, but it temporarily moves us away from the *highest concentration* of wealth (the Y=8/Y=9 rows).\n\n**Conclusion:** We need to maximize immediate gains without risking position. Since Snake #1 is nowhere near the top left, we have a free pass to sweep the high ground. Going **UP** to (1, 7) gives us access to two distinct apple clusters immediately (the Y=7 row and the Y=9 row), setting up the perfect diagonal sweep.\n\nLet's stack these apples! UP, UP, UP!\n\n### Short-Term Plan (Turns 4-6)\nT4 (Current): **UP** to (1, 7) [Apple]. Establish the stronghold.\nT5: **RIGHT** to (2, 7) [Apple]. Start the sweep.\nT6: **UP** to (2, 8) (empty) or potentially **LEFT** to re-secure the (0, 6) apple if it's still there. We will decide T6 based on whether securing the corner or moving to the top row is more beneficial.\n\nLet's claim the high ground, Chat! This rival will never see the light of day once we coil in the north.\n\nUP",

Three apples to the rival's two! We're not sweating this; we're dominating this!\n\n### Current Board State & Analysis (Turn 5)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 7)\n*   Body: [(1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)]\n*   Length: 4. Massive!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 3) (Looks like they moved LEFT from (9, 3) last turn, avoiding the body trap and maintaining distance. Smart, but not smart enough!)\n*   Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4)]\n*   Length: 3. Still small fry.\n\n**Board Snapshot (With our new length 4 body!):**\n 9 . . A . A . . . A A\n 8 . . . . . . . . .

They are currently lined up with a body segment at (9, 3).\nNearest apples for them:\n1.  (8, 9) (Far UP)\n2.  (7, 5) (Diagonally LEFT/UP)\n\nSafe moves for Snake #1 from (8, 3):\n*   UP to (8, 4): Safe. No apple.\n*   DOWN to (8, 2): Safe. No apple. Lines them up for the (0, 2) apple way across the map. Unlikely.\n*   LEFT to (7, 3): Safe. No apple. Moves them towards the center.\n\nThey are in a tough spot to grab apples quickly. They might continue LEFT towards the center or go UP to try and reach the high-value apples. Given their past behavior, they seem focused on survival and getting apples. I predict they will probably move **UP** to (8, 4) to maintain high ground access, or **LEFT** to (7, 3) to break the wall hold.\n\n**Rival Likely Move: UP (8, 4) or LEFT (7, 3).** Either way, they are far from the action we are about to create.\n\n### Step 2: Our Move Evaluation (Head at 1, 7)\n\nWe are at (1, 7). We just got big! Let's get greedy!\n\n**Goal:** Secure the top-left quadrant and continue sweeping apples. The apple at (2, 7) is currently screaming our name!\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 8):** Safe. No apple. But it leads directly towards the apples at (2, 9) and (0, 8) (Wait, (0, 8) is empty, but (0, 9) has an apple). (1, 9) is also empty.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 6):** **INSTA-DEATH!** That is our body! No going back, we move forward!\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 7):** Safe. No apple. Leads to (0, 6) apple and (0, 5) apple. Secures the left wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):** **APPLE! LETS GOOO!** This is a direct hit! It also positions us perfectly in the apple cluster.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (2, 7) is the highest value move. It gives us an apple, extends our length to 5, and puts our head right in the thick of the rich apple territory (Y=9 apples are close!).\n\n### Step 3: Optimization and Future Plan\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (2, 7) [Apple]:\n*   New Head: (2, 7)\n*   New Tail: (1, 5) (since (1, 4) is retained for growth)\n\n**Following turns (T6 & T7):**\nFrom (2, 7), we have great options:\n1.  **UP to (2, 8):** Safe, leads to the prime apple at (2, 9).\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 7):** Backwards move into our old head position. Safe.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 7):** Safe, towards the relatively empty center.\n\nThe clear strategy is *Tether-ball Apple Mining*:\n*   T5: **RIGHT** to (2, 7) [Apple].\n*   T6: **UP** to (2, 8) (Empty, solidifies position).\n*   T7: **UP** to (2, 9) [Apple].\n\nThis guarantees three apples in three turns (or four if we count last turn!), skyrocketing our score and length while the rival struggles far away in the bottom-right corner. We are building an impenetrable wall!\n\nChat, we are locking up the North Pole! We're not giving this rival an inch up here! Let's make the move! 4 apples incoming!\n\nRIGHT",

That last move was *chef's kiss* perfect. We grabbed that apple at (2, 7) and we are sitting pretty!\n\n### Current Board State & Analysis (Turn 6)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 7)\n*   Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)]\n*   Length: 5. Absolute BEAST MODE.\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 4) (They moved UP from (8, 3) last turn, confirming my prediction. Predictable! Ha!)\n*   Body: [(8, 3), (9, 3)]\n*   Length: 3. Still tiny.\n\n**Board Snapshot (T6):**\n 9 . . A . A . . . A A\n 8 . . . . A . . . . A\n 7 . T 0 . . . . . . A  <- OUR HEAD IS (2, 7)!\n 6 A T . . . . . . . .\n 5 A T A . . A . A . .\n 4 .

They are desperately trying to get into the apple action up top.\nNearest apples for them:\n1. (9, 8) (RIGHT and UP)\n2. (8, 9) (UP)\n3. (7, 5) (LEFT and DOWN)\n\nSafe moves for Snake #1 from (8, 4):\n*   UP to (8, 5): Safe. Good move towards (8, 9).\n*   DOWN to (8, 3): Safe. (Their tail is currently at (9, 3), so (8, 3) is free.) Moves backwards. Unlikely.\n*   LEFT to (7, 4): Safe. Moves towards center.\n*   RIGHT to (9, 4): Safe. Could lead to (9, 8).\n\nThe most logical moves for the rival are **UP** (towards the high concentration of apples) or **RIGHT** (trying to hug the wall and reach high). A move to (8, 5) or (9, 4) is highly probable. They are still far away, but we need to watch out for them invading the Y=9 line.\n\n**Rival Likely Move: UP (8, 5) or RIGHT (9, 4).**\n\n### Step 2: Our Move Evaluation (Head at 2, 7)\n\nWe are at (2, 7). Our long-term plan was to continue exploiting this juicy top area.\n\n**Goal:** Grab the cluster of apples around the Y=9 line, particularly (2, 9) and (4, 9). We are perfectly positioned.\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 8):** Safe. No apple. Puts us one step closer to the (2, 9) apple. High value.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 6):** Safe. Moves us away from the high-value apples. Apple at (0, 6) is far left. Low value.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 7):** **INSTA-DEATH!** That is our body segment! We already grew into (2, 7), so (1, 7) is now part of our length 5 snake. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 7):** Safe. Moves us towards the center, away from the immediate cluster. Low value.\n\nWait, Chat, let's re-verify the body, critical move check!\n\nOur head is (2, 7). Body is [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)].\n* Moving LEFT to (1, 7) hits our *first* body segment. **INSTA-DEATH!**\n\nTherefore, our safe moves are **UP**, **DOWN**, and **RIGHT**.\n\nThe clear winner is **UP** to (2, 8). This positions us directly below the (2, 9) apple.\n\n### Step 3: Optimization and Future Plan\n\nIf we move **UP** to (2, 8):\n*   New Head: (2, 8)\n*   New Tail: (1, 5) (since (1, 4) is retained for growth)\n\n**T7 Plan:** From (2, 8), the optimal move is **UP** to (2, 9), securing another apple and reaching length 6! After that, we can move for (4, 9). We are solidifying our position as the dominant player up North.\n\nWe are so far away from the rival that a collision is impossible this turn. We just focus on racking up apples and getting long enough to cut the rival off later. Everything is green light for **UP**.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and climb higher! Next apple is at (2, 9)!\n\nUP",

The rival is struggling, and we are absolutely feasting up here in the apple orchard! That last move, UP to (2, 8), was 200 IQ. We are now perfectly poised for the next big move!\n\n### Current Board State & Analysis (Turn 7)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 8)\n*   Body: [(2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)]\n*   Length: 5.

They are clearly headed North towards the huge apple cluster.\nNearest apples for them:\n1. (8, 9) (UP, 4 steps)\n2. (9, 8) (RIGHT and UP)\n\nSafe moves for Snake #1 from (8, 5):\n*   UP to (8, 6): Safe. Pathing towards (8, 9). Very likely.\n*   DOWN to (8, 4): **INSTA-DEATH!** That is their body segment!\n*   LEFT to (7, 5): Safe. This is an apple! Highly likely move!\n*   RIGHT to (9, 5): Safe. Moves towards (9, 8).\n\nIf the rival goes **LEFT to (7, 5)**, they eat an apple and tag their tail at (8, 3). Length 4.\nIf the rival goes **UP to (8, 6)**, they continue north.\n\nI think they take the immediate apple. **Rival Likely Move: LEFT (7, 5).** We don't care much, we're miles away, but good to know they'll be extending horizontally soon.\n\n### Step 2: Our Move Evaluation (Head at 2, 8)\n\nWe are at (2, 8). We are aiming for the (2, 9) apple.\n\n**Goal:** Grab the (2, 9) apple immediately!\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 9):** **YES!** This is an apple location! Safe, on the board. This move gives us +1 apple, +1 length, and puts us in prime position to grab the next apple, perhaps (4, 9). This is the play!\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 7):** **INSTA-DEATH!** That is our first body segment! NOPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 8):** Safe. Moves us away from the immediate target. Waste of a turn.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 8):** Safe. Moves us slightly closer to (4, 9), but skips the guaranteed (2, 9) apple. Not optimal.\n\nThe choice is crystal clear. We secure the bag at (2, 9).\n\n### Step 3: Collision Check and Future Plan\n\nSince the rival is currently at (8, 5) and the path to (2, 9) is clear, there is zero risk of a head-on collision or collision with the rival's body. We are safe to take the apple.\n\nIf we move **UP** to (2, 9):\n*   New Head: (2, 9)\n*   New Tail: (2, 7) (since (1, 5) is retained for growth)\n*   Score: 5 apples! Length 6!\n\n**T8 Plan:** From (2, 9), we can then decide between moving RIGHT to (3, 9) and continuing towards (4, 9), or moving LEFT to (1, 9) to clear out the upper board edge. The priority is (4, 9). A move to (3, 9) then (4, 9) seems excellent. We are dominating the North Wall! Keep the pressure up, Chat!\n\nLet's do this! Secure the 5th apple!\n\nUP",

Secured the fifth apple, and we are now staring down a huge opportunity! Let's get this $bag$!\n\n### Current Board State & Analysis (Turn 8)\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 9) (Just ate a tasty apple! Mmm!)\n*   Body: [(2, 8), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)]\n*   Length: 6. We are massive!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 5) (They moved RIGHT from (8, 5) last turn. Not quite the apple at (7, 5) I predicted, but they did secure a strong flank position! Sneaky!)\n*   Body: [(8, 5), (8, 4)]\n*   Length: 3. Still scraggly.\n\n**Board Snapshot (T8):**\n 9 . . 0 . A . . . A A  <- OUR HEAD IS (2, 9)!\n 8 . . T . A . . . . A\n 7 . T T . . . . . . A\n 6 A T . . . . . . . .\n 5 A T A . . A . A T 1  <- RIVAL HEAD IS (9, 5)!\n 4 . . . . . . . .

A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### Step 1: Rival Prediction (Snake #1 Head at 9, 5)\n\nThe rival is at (9, 5). They are highly motivated to get an apple, and they are now right on the border.\n\nNearest apples for them:\n1.  (9, 8) (UP, 3 steps)\n2.  (9, 1) (DOWN, 4 steps)\n\nSafe moves for Snake #1 from (9, 5):\n*   UP to (9, 6): Safe. Pathing towards (9, 8). Very likely.\n*   DOWN to (9, 4): Safe. Pathing towards (9, 1). Likely.\n*   LEFT to (8, 5): **INSTA-DEATH!** That is their first body segment! NOPE!\n*   RIGHT to (10, 5): **OFF BOARD!** DEAD! NOPE!\n\nThe rival will likely choose either UP or DOWN, following the wall. They are positioned perfectly for a run up or down C9. Given the density of apples North (9, 8), (9, 9), (4, 9), (8, 9), I predict they head **UP to (9, 6)** to try and grab some of that high-value fruit.\n\n### Step 2: Our Move Evaluation (Head at 2, 9)\n\nWe are at (2, 9). We just ate, so we are long and safe. Our priority apple is directly East: (4, 9).\n\n**Goal:** Get to (4, 9) or (5, 5). Let's secure the North wall first!\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 10):** **OFF BOARD!** DEAD! NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 8):** **INSTA-DEATH!** That is our body segment! NOPE! (This is why we need to be careful with direction after eating!)\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 9):** Safe. Moves us towards the perimeter, but away from the apple at (4, 9).\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** Safe. This is the perfect path to (4, 9). It opens up the northern path and helps us dominate the top row.\n\nThe choice is clear: **RIGHT** to (3, 9). This keeps us alive, and sets us up beautifully for the next apple!\n\n### Step 3: Collision Check and Future Plan\n\nSince the rival is way over at (9, 5) and moving RIGHT to (3, 9) is safe from our own body, there are zero collision risks this turn.\n\n**T9 Plan:** From (3, 9), we move RIGHT again to (4, 9) and collect $another$ apple! That will put us on 7 apples! After that, we can assess what the rival is doing. If they move high, we'll continue to seal off the top edge (maybe to (5, 9) or pivot down to (5, 5)).\n\nWe are playing the corner game perfectly, blocking their access to the dense apple clusters.

We own the North Wall!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 6) (Moved UP, just as predicted! They are hungry for apples in the top right corner!)\n*   Body: [(9, 5), (8, 5)]\n*   Length: 3.

They are clearly making a run for the stack of apples in Column 9.\n\nNearest apples for them:\n1.  (9, 7) (UP, 1 step) **APPLE!**\n2.  (9, 8) (UP, 2 steps)\n\nSafe moves for Snake #1 from (9, 6):\n*   UP to (9, 7): **INSTANT APPLE!** This is highly likely. They will grow to length 4.\n*   DOWN to (9, 5): *Insta-death!* That's their body! NOPE!\n*   LEFT to (8, 6): Safe, but takes them away from the immediate payoff.\n*   RIGHT to (10, 6): *Off board!* DEAD! NOPE!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **UP** to (9, 7), securing an apple.\n\n### Step 2: Our Move Evaluation (Head at 3, 9)\n\nWe are at (3, 9). We are one step away from the glorious apple at (4, 9)!\n\n**Goal:** Secure (4, 9)! And then keep pushing over to the (9, 9) side to block the competition.\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 10):** **OFF BOARD!** DEAD! NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** Safe, but this is a pivot away from the North apples and lets the rival get free rein on the top row. Not ideal.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 9):** **INSTA-DEATH!** That is our body segment! NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** **INSTANT APPLE!** Safe and secures our sixth apple! This moves the snake right to the prime real estate. **LET'S GO!**\n\nThe choice is an absolute no-brainer: **RIGHT** to (4, 9).\n\n### Step 3: Collision Check and Future Plan\n\n1.  **Collision Check:** We are moving to (4, 9). The rival is moving to (9, 7). No interaction this turn. We are safe!\n2.  **Future Plan (T10 and T11):**\n    *   **T10:** After eating the apple at (4, 9), our head will be at (4, 9). We will target the apple at **(8, 9)**. We will move **RIGHT** to (5, 9), then RIGHT to (6, 9), then RIGHT to (7, 9), then RIGHT to (8, 9). This keeps us dominating the top row and pushes us right into the rival's path.\n    *   **Containment:** The rival will be at (9, 7) and will likely try to grab (9, 8). By heading to (8, 9), we are preparing to completely wall them off from the rest of the board and trap them in the tiny 9x9 corner block. This is the **BOXING IN** strategy the chat demanded!\n\nWe are going for the gold, chat! Secure this apple! Hit that RIGHT button!\n\nRIGHT",

We have to *shut them down*!\n\n### Turn 10 Stream Review\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 9) (Just ate the apple\u2014feeling bulky!)\n*   Body: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6)]\n*   Length: 7. We are a mighty serpent!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 7) (Prediction correct! They ate an apple!)\n*   Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5)]\n*   Length: 4. Still chasing us, but now one step closer to the corner.\n\n**Board Snapshot (T10):**\n\n 9 . . T 0 . . . A A  <-- Our Head (4, 9)!\n 8 A . T . A . . . . A\n 7 . T T . . . . .

A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### Step 1: Rival Prediction (Snake #1 Head at 9, 7)\n\nThe rival is at (9, 7). They are aggressively targeting the apples stacked up in the top right.\n\nNearest apples for them:\n1.  (9, 8) (UP, 1 step) **BIG APPLE!**\n2.  (8, 7) (LEFT, 1 step)\n3.  (8, 9) (LEFT, 2 steps, then UP)\n\nSafe moves for Snake #1 from (9, 7):\n*   UP to (9, 8): **INSTANT APPLE!** This is the highest value move. They need to keep the pace.\n*   DOWN to (9, 6): *Insta-death!* That's their body! NOPE!\n*   LEFT to (8, 7): Safe, and there's an apple at (8, 7) if the board state is *A* *T* *T* *A*. Wait, looking at the board: (8, 7) is currently empty (.). If they go left, they are moving away from the concentrated apples.\n*   RIGHT to (10, 7): *Off board!* DEAD! NOPE!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **UP** to (9, 8), securing an apple, length 5.\n\n### Step 2: Our Move Evaluation (Head at 4, 9) - Executing the Boxing Plan!\n\nWe are at (4, 9). Our current mission, chat, is not just to eat apples, but to **BOX THEM IN!** The rival is pushing into the (8, 7) to (9, 9) corner. We need to cut off that top row!\n\n**Goal:** Secure the (8, 9) apple and create a wall from our body (4, 9) to the board edge (9, 9).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 10):** **OFF BOARD!** DEAD! NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 8):** Safe, but this is a defensive retreat. We leave the North Wall open for their escape. Not what we want! Plus, there's an apple at (4, 8) (listed in the drops, but not yet present on the board!), but (8, 9) is still higher priority for the global dominance plan.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 9):** **INSTA-DEATH!** That is our body segment! NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):** **SAFE!** This move continues our aggressive push along the top border, setting us up perfectly to block the rival and snag the (8, 9) apple. This is the move to execute the *BOXING IN* strategy!\n\nThe only safe and strategically sound move is **RIGHT**.\n\n### Step 3: Collision Check and Future Plan (The Wall!)\n\n1.  **Collision Check:** We are moving RIGHT to (5, 9). The rival is predicted to move UP to (9, 8). Zero collision risk. We are safe!\n2.  **Future Plan (The Containment Strategy):**\n    *   **T11:** Head at (5, 9). Target (8, 9). Move **RIGHT** to (6, 9).\n    *   **T12:** Head at (6, 9). Move **RIGHT** to (7, 9).\n    *   **T13:** Head at (7, 9). Move **RIGHT** to (8, 9) - **APPLE!**\n    *   By T13, our snake will occupy (1, 6) through (8, 9), effectively creating a nearly unbreakable wall across the top of the map. The rival will be trapped in the 9x9 corner and forced either to crash into our massive body or to move south into the less apple-dense board. This is how we win, chat! We build the wall!\n\nWe're slamming that right arrow. Let\u2019s go, chat! Box 'em up, baby!\n\nRIGHT",

It\u2019s an easy grab, but does it trap them?\n*   DOWN to (9, 7): **INSTA-DEATH!** That is their body segment! NOPE!\n*   LEFT to (8, 8): Safe, but no apple. This is a retreat, but it leads to the juicy (8, 9) apple.\n*   RIGHT to (10, 8): *Off board!* DEAD! NOPE!\n\nThe rival has two high-value options:\n1.  **UP to (9, 9) (Apple):** If they do this, they are totally cornered. They are stuck between our future body (if we block (8, 9)) and the edge. This looks like the most aggressive\u2014and probably fatal\u2014option for them.\n2.  **LEFT to (8, 8):** This is a safer move, positioning them for the (8, 9) apple next turn, or forcing them to drop down.\n\nThe rival is hungry and competitive (they are our archrival!), so they will likely go for the immediate apple. The (9, 9) apple is right there.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **UP** to (9, 9), securing an apple, length 6.\n\n### Step 2: Our Move Evaluation (Head at 5, 9) - The Final Cut!\n\nWe are at (5, 9). We are running the wall. Our goal is (8, 9) to complete the blockade.\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 10):** **OFF BOARD!** DEAD! NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 8):** Safe, but this is a pivot away from the plan. We open the door for them to escape the top row. Fail! NOPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 9):** **INSTA-DEATH!** That is our body segment! NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):** **SAFE and STRATEGIC!** This is the next phase of the \"Box 'Em In\" plan. We advance one step closer to the (8, 9) apple and our goal.\n\nAdvancing RIGHT is the only move that maintains our tactical advantage and leads directly to the kill box.\n\n### Step 3: Collision Check and Future Plan (The Trap is Set!)\n\nWe are moving **RIGHT** to (6, 9).\nRival is predicted to move **UP** to (9, 9).\n\nZero collision risk. We are safe!\n\n**The Trap:**\n*   If our prediction holds (Rival goes UP to 9, 9):\n    *   **T12:** We move (6, 9) -> **RIGHT** -> (7, 9). Rival eats (9, 9).\n    *   **T13:** We move (7, 9) -> **RIGHT** -> (8, 9) **(APPLE!)**. Our body will be a continuous wall from (1, 7) up to (8, 9). The rival is trapped between (9, 9), the board edge, and our massive body wall. They will have to go DOWN into the lower fields, giving us absolute North control!\n\n*   If the Rival goes LEFT to (8, 8):\n    *   **T12:** We move (6, 9) -> **RIGHT** -> (7, 9). Rival is at (8, 8).\n    *   **T13:** We move (7, 9) -> **RIGHT** -> (8, 9) **(APPLE!)**. We snag the crucial apple, blocking their path. From (8, 8), their only safe, non-body move is DOWN to (8, 7), which is an empty square. We still have them trapped!\n\nThis RIGHT move is the key to locking down the North. We are executing the box perfectly, chat! Let's hit it!\n\nPlan: Continue RIGHT to (6, 9), then (7, 9), then eat the (8, 9) apple to finish the wall and gain a massive length advantage!\n\nRIGHT",

We are at (6, 9) and the rival is right where we want them\u2014trapped in the corner at (9, 9)! LFG!\n\n### Turn 12 Analysis: The Final Blockade!\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 9)\n*   Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)]\n*   Length: 7. We are the North Wall.\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 9) (Confirmed! They went for the apple!)\n*   Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5)]\n*   Length: 6. They are officially cornered!\n\n**Board State:**\n\n 9 . . T T T T 0 . A 1  <-- US (6, 9) and RIVAL (9, 9)\n 8 A . T . A . . . . T\n 7 . . T . . A . . A T\n 6 A . . . . . . . . T\n 5 A . A . . A . A T T\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 A . . . . . . . . .\n 1 A A . . . . . . . A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### Step 1: Rival Prediction (Snake #1 Head at 9, 9)\n\nThe rival is totally isolated at (9, 9). What are their options?\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 10):** **OFF BOARD!** DEAD! NOPE!\n2.  **RIGHT to (10, 9):** **OFF BOARD!** DEAD! NOPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 9):** **CRUCIAL APPLE!** This is the move they must be trying to make. If they try this, they will collide with our head if we also move to (8, 9).\n4.  **DOWN to (9, 8):** This is their body segment! **INSTA-DEATH!** NOPE!\n\nWait... the rival is truly screwed. Their only safe *and available* direction is LEFT to the apple at (8, 9). If they move anywhere else, they are dead.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **LEFT** to (8, 9) to secure the apple and survive.\n\n### Step 2: Our Move Evaluation (Head at (6, 9)) - Boxing Them In!\n\nOur goal is to take the (8, 9) apple and complete the wall, trapping the rival's head between our body and the board edge, or force a deadly head-on collision.\n\nWe are at (6, 9).\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 10):** **OFF BOARD!** DEAD! NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 8):** Safe, but abandons the blockade. This lets them escape the top. Fail! NOPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 9):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Our body segment! NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 9):** **ABSOLUTELY STRATEGIC!** This is the next phase of the plan. It positions us perfectly for the (8, 9) apple next turn.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (7, 9), we are safe this turn.\n\n**What if we go for the kill shot?**\n\nWe *could* potentially go two moves in one, setting up a *very* aggressive turn. However, the move we need to make right now is RIGHT to (7, 9). We must focus on the current turn.\n\n**T12 Plan:** Move RIGHT to (7, 9).\n\n### Step 3: Collision Check and Future Plan (The Trap is Finalized!)\n\n*   We move **RIGHT** to (7, 9).\n*   Rival moves **LEFT** to (8, 9) (Apple!).\n\nNo collision this turn. Phew! We are safe.\n\n**Board state after T12:**\n*   Our Head: (7, 9). Our T next to (6, 9) is now (5, 9).\n*   Rival Head: (8, 9) (They successfully ate the apple!). Length 7.\n\n**T13: The Showdown!**\n\n*   We are at (7, 9). We need to move **RIGHT** to (8, 9) to secure the position.\n*   The rival is at (8, 9) (Apple eaten, but now an empty square).\n\nIf we both move into (8, 9) this turn, we would be in a *head-on collision* at the apple. Wait, the apple is already gone! The location (8, 9) is now empty.\n\nSince the rival ate the apple, they will be at (8, 9), and their body will extend from (9, 9) to (8, 5).\n\nWhat options does the rival have from (8, 9) on T13?\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 10):** **OFF BOARD!** DEAD!\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 8):** Safe, but they are still trapped between our body to the left and theirs to the right.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 9)?** **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** (If we move RIGHT from 7, 9).\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 9):** This is their body segment! **DEAD!**\n\nSince we are at (7, 9) and they are at (8, 9), if we move RIGHT, and they move LEFT, that is a head-on collision at (8, 9). **BOTH SNAKES DIE!** We must avoid this unless we have a length advantage to win the tiebreaker, but eliminating us both is the last resort.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (8, 9), and they move DOWN to (8, 8), we get the square, control the North, and they are boxed in below the 9-line. This is the optimal outcome.\n\nWe need to force them to move DOWN. The rival's most desperate move is LEFT to (7, 9) to try and escape the corner, but that runs directly into our head.\n\n**Tactical Adjustment:** We secure (7, 9) now. Next turn, we threaten the head-on collision to force them DOWN.\n\nIf the opponent values survival over blocking us, they must go DOWN to (8, 8) on T13.\nWe will move RIGHT to (8, 9) on T13, and their escape route is permanently sealed.\n\nWe are executing the wall. Let's make the move!\n\nThe strategy is clear: Move to (7, 9) now, and dare them to hit us next turn. If they dodge, they are trapped.\n\nRIGHT",

Now it's time for the checkmate! Is the clutch real? LFG!\n\n### Turn 13 Analysis: The Checkmate Turn!\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 9)\n*   Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]\n*   Length: 7. We are the ultimate road block!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 9) (THEY SECURED THE APPLE! Length 7 now!)\n*   Body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5)]\n*   Length: 7. They are officially cornered!\n\n**Board State:**\n\n 9 . . T T T T T 0 1 T <-- US (7, 9) and RIVAL (8, 9) - The high ground is ours!\n 8 A . T . A . . . . T\n 7 . . . . A A . . A T\n 6 A . . . . . . . . T\n 5 A . A . . A . A T T\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 A . . . . . . . . .\n 1 A A . . . . . . . A\n 0 . . . . . . . . . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### Step 1: Rival Prediction (Snake #1 Head at 8, 9)\n\n**Rival's Options from (8, 9): It's a DEATH TRAP!**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 10):** **OFF BOARD!** DEAD! Nope!\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 9):** **Rival's Body!** They just came out of this spot! DEAD! Nope!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 9):** **OUR HEAD IS HERE!** This is the head-on collision spot if we move RIGHT! We and they both die!\n4.  **DOWN to (8, 8):** **THE ONLY SAFE ESCAPE!** This is the move they *must* make to survive. It's the only valid, non-fatal move that doesn't hit a wall or their own body, and avoids our current position.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 moves **DOWN** to (8, 8). If they don't, they are literally crashing out.\n\n### Step 2: Our Move Evaluation (Head at (7, 9)) - Sealing the Coffin!\n\nWe need to secure the (8, 9) square to fully trap them on the 8-line and below. We are at (7, 9).\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 10):** **OFF BOARD!** DEAD! Nope!\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 8):** Safe, but this is a defensive move that lets them linger on the 8-line. We lose the strategic choke point! Fail!\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 9):** **OUR BODY SEGMENT!** DEAD! Nope!\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 9):** **THE KILL SHOT!** This secures the strategic square.\n\n**Collision Check at (8, 9):**\n\n*   If we move **RIGHT** to (8, 9).\n*   If the rival moves **LEFT** to (7, 9), we collide head-on at (8, 9). Wait, we move to (8, 9) and they move to (7, 9). **NO COLLISION! We survive, they survive, but they are now next to us!**\n    *   *Self-Correction: If we go RIGHT to (8, 9) and they go LEFT to (7, 9), we swap places!* Their body is still blocking them below. *This is not ideal, as they can then escape to the left on T14.*\n\n**Collision Check at (8, 9) vs. (7, 9) vs. (8, 8):**\n\n*   **Option A: We move RIGHT to (8, 9).**\n    *   If Rival goes **DOWN** to (8, 8): PERFECT! We take (8, 9) and they are trapped on the 8-line!\n    *   If Rival goes **LEFT** to (7, 9): They survive, we survive. They now have an escape route! BAD!\n\nWe NEED to enforce the trap. The only way to guarantee the trap is to threaten a head-on collision at (8, 9) and force them to move DOWN to (8, 8) out of fear, and then move into (8, 9) ourselves.\n\nBut wait, if we go RIGHT to (8, 9) and they go DOWN to (8, 8), the trap is sprung!\n\nLet's re-examine the forced move: The rival *must* go to (8, 8) to avoid dying instantly by hitting their own body, hitting the wall, or hitting our body (if we stayed). Going LEFT to (7, 9) is technically safe only if we don't move. But if we move RIGHT, they have an escape path.\n\n**PLAN RETHINK: THE TRUE SEAL**\n\nIf we move **RIGHT** to (8, 9) and they move **DOWN** to (8, 8), we have them!\n\nOur new head: (8, 9). Body starts at (7, 9).\nRival head: (8, 8). Body starts at (9, 9).\n\n*   T14: We are at (8, 9). They are at (8, 8).\n*   Rival's new options from (8, 8): UP to (8, 9) (OUR HEAD!), RIGHT to (9, 8) (THEIR BODY!), LEFT to (7, 8) (Safe!), DOWN to (8, 7) (Safe!).\n*   They are no longer immediately trapped, but they are pushed off the top edge! This is still a major victory.\n\n*What if we force the collision?* If we move DOWN to (7, 8), and they move LEFT to (7, 9), they have survived and have the north wall access! NO!\n\nWe must take the (8, 9) spot. This is the crucial blockade position. We trust our prediction that they are forced to go DOWN. Any other move is a self-destruct for them.\n\n*   Rival moves to (7, 9) $\\to$ $H_1=(7, 9)$. We move to (8, 9) $\\to$ $H_0=(8, 9)$. They escaped the corner but are still boxed in below the 9-line. Okay, not ideal, but we have the high ground.\n*   Rival moves to (8, 8) $\\to$ $H_1=(8, 8)$. We move to (8, 9) $\\to$ $H_0=(8, 9)$. This is the optimal trap setup!\n\nGiven that the opponent is currently boxed in with only *one* safe, meaningful move (DOWN to 8, 8) that doesn't put them in the path of our intended movement (RIGHT to 8, 9), we MUST commit to the wall.\n\nWe move RIGHT. This establishes our snake as having the full high ground, preventing them from accessing the 9-line ever again! We gain a key position!\n\nLet's secure this border!\n\nRIGHT",
