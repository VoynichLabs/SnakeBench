Move UP to (0, 8) (Safe, but no apple)\n2. Move DOWN to (0, 6) (Safe, but no apple)\n3. Move LEFT to (-1, 7) (Hits wall, not valid)\n4. Move RIGHT to (1, 7) (Safe, but no apple)\n\nNone of these moves allow me to collect an apple immediately, but I should also consider future moves to reach reachable apples.\n\nHowever, while moving UP or RIGHT are safe options (DOWN is also safe but leads further down away from the apples), moving to the right (1, 7) opens up options towards (2, 7) and further angles to reach apples. The apple at (5, 8) is reachable after making lateral movements. \n\nWhile it would seem strategic to move toward apples as much as possible, I cannot reach any in my immediate next move. It is important to consider future directions that could allow movement toward apples on future turns.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Focus on lateral movement to eventually reach apples while avoiding paths toward the walls or towards the enemy snake.\n\nBased on this evaluation, my best move is to go **RIGHT to (1, 7)** to set up future opportunities.\n\nNext move: RIGHT.",

There are several apples available, with the closest ones being at (5, 8) and (8, 4).\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position at (0, 7), it is quite far away and not an immediate threat. However, the goal is to have the most points, so it's important to focus on collecting the apples.\n\nGiven the snake's current position, the best move would be to go LEFT to collect the apple at (8, 4). This will allow the snake to grow and gain a point.\n\nAfter that, the snake can potentially move UP to collect the apple at (5, 8), further increasing its score.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: LEFT.\n\nAnd my strategy for the next turn is to move UP to collect the apple at (5, 8).",
