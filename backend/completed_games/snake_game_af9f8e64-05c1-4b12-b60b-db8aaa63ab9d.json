We are at (1, 5) and Snake #1 is right below us at (1, 4). He's literally breathing down our neck! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nCan we talk about how aggressive this start is?! We've both got 0 apples, so a head-on collision right now is a total DRAW. We don't want a draw; we want the WIN! We want that crown! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's look at our options:\n- **UP**: Moves us to (1, 6). Safe, keeps us away from his current spot, and puts us closer to the apples at (0, 8) and (1, 9).\n- **DOWN**: This is a direct head-on collision if he moves UP, or we land on his current head if he stays/moves elsewhere. Too risky for Turn 1! We don't want to throw the game in the first ten seconds!\n- **LEFT**: Moves us to (0, 5). There is an APPLE right there! \ud83c\udf4e CONTENT! If we take (0, 5), we grow to size 2. However, he could move to (0, 4) or (1, 5) and try to cut us off against the wall.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves us to (2, 5). Opens up the center of the board.\n\nChat, we need to establish dominance EARLY. If we go LEFT, we grab that apple at (0, 5) immediately. But check this out: if he moves LEFT to (0, 4) at the same time, we've basically pinned him against the left wall while we have the height advantage. \n\nWait, looking at the apple drops, there's a juicy one at (1, 3) too. He's likely going to dive for that or the one at (0, 2). If I go LEFT, I secure a point and growth immediately. If I go UP, I play it safe but let him dictate the bottom half. \n\nRUTHLESS MOVE: We're going for the apple at (0, 5). It gives us the length advantage. In Snake, length is POWER. If we are bigger, he has to fear the head-on! Let's grab that snack and start building the cage!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Grab the apple at (0, 5) to get to size 2. After that, look to loop around or head toward (1, 3) to contest his growth. Keep him pinned in the corner!\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s a juicy head\u2011to\u2011head stand\u2011off, but we\u2019re both at 0 apples so a head\u2011on would just be a draw\u2014no thanks! I see an apple literally one step below us at (1,3). That\u2019s a free point and a growth spurt if we move DOWN. Down also puts us out of immediate head\u2011on danger, and if the opponent foolishly moves down onto (1,4) next turn, they\u2019ll crash into our freshly grown body and we\u2019ll be up a snake \ud83d\udc80.\n\nOther options? LEFT to (0,4) or RIGHT to (2,4) are safe, but they don\u2019t give us an apple right now and they leave us closer to the enemy\u2019s potential moves. UP is a head\u2011on collision\u2014both die, not the play when we\u2019re tied.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns:**  \n1) Grab that apple at (1,3) now.  \n2) After growing, look for the next nearest apple\u2014maybe (3,4) or (5,4)\u2014while keeping an eye on the enemy\u2019s head.  \n3) If they try to cut us off, we can use our longer body to block their path or force them into a dead\u2011end.\n\nLet\u2019s get that first apple and make them regret spawning next to us! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

Look at the scoreboard: tied at 1-1, but we have the positional advantage! \n\nOur rival (Snake #1) is sitting at (1, 3). He's currently heading SOUTH or EAST because we just took his north. Let's look at the board:\n- **Our position**: Head (0, 5), Body [(1, 5)]. \n- **Enemy position**: Head (1, 3), Body [(1, 4)].\n\nWait, do you see what I see?! He's stuck between us and the wall! He's at (1, 3). If he tries to go UP, he hits his own body at (1, 4). He's forced to go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n**LETS CALCULATE THE PLAYS:**\n- **UP**: Moves us to (0, 6). Safe! It takes us away from him and keeps us along the wall, heading toward those juicy apples at (0, 8) and (1, 9).\n- **DOWN**: Moves us to (0, 4). CHAT, THIS IS THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY! If he moves LEFT to (0, 3) and we move DOWN to (0, 4), we are literally one square away from his head. We are shadowing him!\n- **LEFT**: Instant death! We'd fly off the board at (-1, 5). We don't do that here! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT**: Moves us to (1, 5). THAT'S BACKWARDS! Our body is there. That\u2019s a self-frag, and we aren't noobs!\n\nSo it's UP or DOWN. If we go UP, we play the long game. If we go DOWN, we start the **BOX-IN MANEUVER**. \n\nLook at the apple at (0, 2). He wants it. He's going to go DOWN to (1, 2) or LEFT to (0, 3) to get it. If we move DOWN to (0, 4), we are cutting off his escape route to the north and pinning him against the bottom-left corner. We have the length to block him! \n\nWait, check the apple drops... (3, 4) and (5, 4) are in the middle. We want to control the left side of the board and force him to crash into the wall or our tail. Let's go DOWN and squeeze the life out of his options! Stay on him like glue!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Moving DOWN to (0, 4) puts pressure on his head at (1, 3). We are bigger/equal, so we don't fear the head-on if it comes to it later, but right now we want to wrap around him. Next turn we likely continue DOWN to (0, 3) to keep him trapped in that (1,2) area.\n\nDOWN",

We are literally breathing down Snake #1's neck! He's at (0, 3) now (Wait\u2014did he move left? My sensors say his head is at (0, 3) and his tail is at (1, 3)). \n\n**HUGE DISCOVERY:** He moved LEFT! He's now pinned against the wall at (0, 3). Check the board:\n- **Our Head**: (0, 4)\n- **His Head**: (0, 3)\n- **Board Edge**: x=0 is the left wall.\n\nHE IS DIRECTLY BELOW US! \ud83d\udea8 Since we move simultaneously, if I move DOWN to (0, 3) and he stays still (impossible) or moves, we might collide! If he moves RIGHT to (1, 3), he hits his own tail (RIP him!). If he moves DOWN to (0, 2), he's safe for a second. If he moves UP... **BAM!** Head-on collision at (0, 4) or (0, 3)!\n\nSince we are tied in score (1-1), a head-on collision is a DRAW. We don't play for draws, we play for the DUB! \ud83c\udfc6 \n\n**LET'S EVALUATE:**\n- **UP**: Moves us to (0, 5). Safe, but we already were there. It gives him room to breathe. We don't want that!\n- **DOWN**: Moves us to (0, 3). This is the \"Aggressive Alpha\" play, but it's a 50/50. if he moves UP, we both die. If he moves DOWN, we follow him.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves us to (1, 4). CHAT! This is the high-IQ play! \ud83e\udde0 If we move to (1, 4), we are flanking him. We cut off his escape to the right. He's trapped in column 0!\n- **LEFT**: Off the board. We aren't throwing!\n\n**STRATEGY:** If I go RIGHT to (1, 4), I position myself to completely box him into the bottom-left corner. He's at (0, 3). If he goes DOWN to (0, 2), and I'm at (1, 4), I can then move DOWN to (1, 3) or (1, 2) and he's totally surrounded by the wall and my body! \n\nHe's desperate for that apple at (0, 2). Let's let him think he's getting it while we build the coffin! By moving RIGHT, we avoid the head-on collision risk at (0, 3) and maintain board control. \n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:** Move Right, then shadow him from the (1, y) column. Keep him pinned against the x=0 wall. Once he hits (0, 0), he's got nowhere to go but into us! Let's get this bread! \ud83e\udd56\n\nRIGHT",

Even if they slide away, our head would still be entering a cell that becomes their body \u2013 that\u2019s a self\u2011inflicted crash for us. Not worth the risk when the scores are tied!  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 free cell, contains an apple, grows us to length\u202f3, and if the enemy dares move DOWN they\u2019ll hit our freshly\u2011grown body and get eliminated. If they run RIGHT they escape, but we\u2019re still bigger and can start chasing them across the board.  \n\n**Conclusion:** DOWN is the only safe, aggressive, and apple\u2011grabbing move. It sets up a potential instant knockout while keeping our options wide open for the next turns.  \n\n**Plan for the next few turns:**  \n1. **This turn:** DOWN \u2192 eat the apple at (0,2) and grow to 3 segments.  \n2. **Next turn:** Move RIGHT to (1,2) to start heading toward the central apple cluster (2,2, 3,4, 5,4, etc.). While we do that, keep an eye on the opponent \u2013 if they try to sneak down they\u2019ll crash into our body; if they go right we\u2019ll be right behind them, ready to cut them off.  \n3. Continue to dominate the right side of the board, collect more apples, and force a head\u2011on only when we have the length advantage.  \n\nAlright chat, let\u2019s make that snake S\u2011L\u2011I\u2011T\u2011H\u2011E\u2011R and show \u2019em who\u2019s boss!  \n\n**DOWN**",

But check the scoreboard\u2014Snake #1 just ate another apple! He\u2019s at 2 apples, and we\u2019re at 1. We can't let him get too comfortable with that lead! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**CURRENT TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **Our Head**: (1, 4)\n- **Our Body**: [(0, 4)]\n- **Opponent Snake #1**: Head at (0, 2), Body at (0, 3) and (1, 3). \n\nWait, CHAT, look at him! He\u2019s tangled himself up! His head is at (0, 2), but his body is at (1, 3) and (0, 3). He\u2019s literally hugging the wall and his own tail. If he tries to go UP, he hits himself at (0, 3). If he tries to go RIGHT, he hits himself at (1, 3) or (1, 2) once it moves! He's in a TIGHT spot! \ud83e\udd0f\n\n**WHERE DO WE GO?**\n- **LEFT**: Moves us to (0, 4). WAIT! That\u2019s where our own tail is! We\u2019d be hitting ourselves. Absolute THROW. \ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN**: Moves us to (1, 3). NO! His body is currently at (1, 3). Even though it moves, he's currently occupying that space. Too risky, and we'd be right next to his head at (0, 2). \ud83d\udcc9\n- **UP**: Moves us to (1, 5). This is safe! It keeps us in the mix and lets us look at those apples at (3, 4) or (5, 4) or even the ones way up high! \ud83c\udf88\n- **RIGHT**: Moves us to (2, 4). This is also safe! It puts us closer to the center of the board and near that (3, 4) apple. \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE ALPHA PLAY:**\nSnake #1 is currently trapped at (0, 2). His only safe moves are DOWN to (0, 1) or RIGHT to (1, 2) (if his tail clears). He is low on the board. If we go **RIGHT** to (2, 4), we are positioning ourselves to cut off the entire middle of the board. \n\nWe need to stay mobile. If we go UP, we\u2019re just running away. If we go RIGHT, we are asserting dominance! We can then pivot DOWN to (2, 3) or (2, 2) to wall him into that bottom left corner forever! \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Let him struggle in the basement while we take over the Penthouse! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (2, 4). Then, depending on where he squirms, we either head DOWN to (2, 3) to keep him boxed in or go for the apple at (3, 4) to even up the score! We need that 2nd apple to stay competitive!

Let\u2019s scan the situation real quick:\n\n**Our snake (ID\u202f1)**  \n- Head at **(0,\u202f2)** \u2013 we just munched that apple last turn!  \n- Body segments: **(0,\u202f3)** and **(1,\u202f3)** (tail).  \n- Score\u202f=\u202f2 apples (we\u2019re in the lead!).\n\n**Enemy snake (ID\u202f0)**  \n- Head at **(1,\u202f4)** \u2013 they\u2019re short and twitchy.  \n- Tail at **(0,\u202f4)**.  \n- Score\u202f=\u202f1 apple.\n\n**Apples on the board** \u2013 a bunch are scattered, but the juicy one we care about right now is at **(2,\u202f2)** (just two steps to our right). There\u2019s also a cluster near the center: (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (5,3) \u2013 prime real estate for us to dominate later.\n\n**What are our options this turn?**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 moves to **(0,\u202f3)**, which is our own body \u2013 instant death \ud83d\udc80.  \n2. **DOWN** \u2192 lands on **(0,\u202f1)** (empty, no apple). It\u2019s safe, but it puts us in a narrow corridor with only two safe follow\u2011up moves (down again or right). That\u2019s a bit cramped and doesn\u2019t bring us closer to the nearby apple.  \n3. **LEFT** \u2192 off the board \u2013 RIP.  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 slides to **(1,\u202f2)** (empty). This keeps three safe exits next turn (up, down, right), moves us straight toward the apple at **(2,\u202f2)**, and starts our push into the center of the board where we can cut off the enemy later.\n\n**Enemy\u2019s probable moves** \u2013 they can\u2019t go DOWN (they\u2019d hit our tail) and they can\u2019t go LEFT (their own tail). So they\u2019ll either go **UP** to (1,5) or **RIGHT** to (2,4). Both escape routes keep them alive, but they\u2019re moving away from the center apples. If they go RIGHT, they\u2019ll eye the apple at (3,4). We can beat them to the punch by securing the right side first.\n\n**Why RIGHT is the play**  \n- Keeps us alive and opens up the most options.  \n- Sets up a clean path to eat the apple at (2,2) next turn, growing our length to 4 and giving us an even bigger score lead.  \n- Positions us to chase the opponent from behind and possibly force a head\u2011on collision (we win ties on score) or block their access to the central apple cluster.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns**  \n1. **This turn:** RIGHT \u2192 (1,2).  \n2. **Next turn:** RIGHT again \u2192 (2,2), munch that apple and grow to 4 segments.  \n3. **After that:** Keep pushing right/up toward the center apples (3,4, 5,4, etc.) while watching the enemy. If they try to sneak back left, we\u2019ll be ready to cut them off or force a swap\u2011death with our longer body.\n\nAlright chat, let\u2019s make that snake S\u2011L\u2011I\u2011T\u2011H\u2011E\u2011R and show \u2019em who\u2019s boss!  \n\n**RIGHT**",

He's currently a tiny 3-segment snake huddled in the corner while we are primed to take over the board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**CURRENT TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **Our Head**: (2, 4)\n- **Our Body**: [(1, 4)]\n- **Opponent Snake #1**: Head at (1, 2), Body at (0, 2), (0, 3).\n- **Apple Watch**: There is a juicy apple right next to us at (3, 4)! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**WHERE DO WE SLIDE?**\n- **LEFT**: Moves us to (1, 4). That is our own body! We aren't throwing the game on Turn 4! \ud83d\udeab\n- **UP**: Moves us to (2, 5). Safe, but we move away from the immediate pressure and the apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moves us to (2, 3). This is the **AGGRESSIVE** play! \ud83e\udd4a If he tries to move RIGHT to (2, 2), we are staring him right in the face one square away.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves us to (3, 4). **BINGO!** \ud83c\udfaf This lands us directly on an apple, bringing our score to 2 and increasing our length. \n\n**THE ALPHA STRATEGY:**\nSnake #1 is low. If we take (3, 4), we tie the score at 2-2. More importantly, we become 3 segments long. Since he is currently length 3, if we eat this apple, we reach length 3 as well. \n\nWait, let's look at his options! He is at (1, 2).\n- His UP (1, 3) is clear (his body moved from there).\n- His RIGHT (2, 2) is clear.\n- His DOWN (1, 1) is clear.\nIf we go RIGHT to (3, 4), we are two steps away from him. If we go DOWN to (2, 4), we are closer, but (3, 4) gives us the growth we need to dominate.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (3, 4) this turn. That levels the score! After that, we look at the apple at (5, 4) or (4, 3). We want to stay above him, effectively \"ceilinging\" him into the bottom of the map. If he tries to climb up, we cut him off and force him to crash into our side! We are building a wall and he's going to pay for it in points! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s scan the situation real quick:\n\n**Our snake (ID\u202f1)**\n- Head at **(1,\u202f2)** \u2013 we\u2019re low\u2011left but we\u2019ve got 2 apples already, leading the score!\n- Body: **[(0,\u202f2), (0,\u202f3)]** \u2013 tail hanging at (0,\u202f3).\n- Score\u202f=\u202f2 apples.\n\n**Enemy snake (ID\u202f0)**\n- Head at **(2,\u202f4)** \u2013 they\u2019re short and twitchy.\n- Body: **[(1,\u202f4)]** \u2013 tail at (1,\u202f4).\n- Score\u202f=\u202f1 apple.\n\n**Apples on the board** \u2013 a bunch are scattered, but the one we care about right now is at **(2,\u202f2)** (just a step to our right!). There\u2019s also a juicy cluster near the center: (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (5,3) \u2013 prime real estate we wanna dominate later.\n\n**What are our options this turn?**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (1,\u202f3) \u2013 safe, but no apple and leaves us in a tight corner.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (1,\u202f1) \u2013 safe, but same issue: no apple and cramped.\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (0,\u202f2) \u2013 that\u2019s our own body, instant death \ud83d\udc80. NOPE.\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,\u202f2) \u2013 empty, grabs the apple, grows us to length\u202f4, and pushes us toward the center.\n\n**Enemy\u2019s probable moves** \u2013 they can\u2019t go LEFT (they\u2019d hit their own tail) and they can\u2019t go DOWN (they\u2019d hit our tail at (0,\u202f3)). So they\u2019ll either go **UP** to (2,\u202f5), **DOWN** to (2,\u202f3), or **RIGHT** to (3,\u202f4) (where an apple awaits them). All three are safe for us if we choose RIGHT.\n\n**Checking collisions for RIGHT:**\n- Our new head (2,\u202f2) isn\u2019t on any of their future body parts.\n- Their future heads (2,\u202f5), (2,\u202f3), (3,\u202f4) don\u2019t intersect our new body [(2,\u202f2), (1,\u202f2), (0,\u202f2), (0,\u202f3)].\n- No head\u2011on crash. We survive, they survive (for now). But we\u2019re bigger and scoring more.\n\n**Why RIGHT is the play:**\n- Keeps us alive and opens up the most options.\n- Instantly eats the apple at (2,\u202f2), raising our score to **3 apples** and our length to **4**.\n- Positions us to chase the opponent from behind and maybe block their escape to the central apples.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns (write this down for my future self):**\n1. **This turn:** RIGHT \u2192 (2,\u202f2), munch that apple, grow to 4 segments.\n2. **Next turn:** Assess enemy\u2019s move. If they go RIGHT to (3,\u202f4), we\u2019ll move **UP** to (2,\u202f3) to close the gap and start cutting off their path to the cluster. If they go UP/DOWN, we can **RIGHT** again to (3,\u202f2) or **UP** to (2,\u202f3) to keep pressuring them.\n3. **Goal:** Dominate the center apples (3,4, 5,4, 4,3, 5,3) while using our longer body as a wall. If we can force a head\u2011on collision later, we win on score.\n\nAlright chat, let\u2019s make that snake S\u2011L\u2011I\u2011T\u2011H\u2011E\u2011R and show \u2019em who\u2019s boss!  \n\n**RIGHT**",

But look at the scoreboard\u2014Snake #1 is at 3 apples too! He's trying to keep pace, but he's currently length 4 while we are length 3. WE NEED TO EQUALIZE OR EXTERMINATE! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **Our Head**: (3, 4)\n- **Our Body**: [(2, 4), (1, 4)] \u2014 We are a sleek horizontal line.\n- **Enemy Snake #1**: Head at (2, 2). Body: [(1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3)].\n- **Apple Alert**: There\u2019s a juicy apple at (4, 3) and another at (5, 4). \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**TACTICAL ANALYSIS:**\nThe enemy is at (2, 2). If we move **DOWN** to (3, 3), we are directly adjacent to him. If he moves **RIGHT** to (3, 2) or **UP** to (2, 3), we are in a high-tension standoff!\n- **UP (3, 5)**: Completely safe, keeps us in the open, but lets him breathe. We don't want him to breathe!\n- **DOWN (3, 3)**: This is the GIGA-CHAD move. We move closer to the (4, 3) apple and put ourselves in a position to cut him off if he tries to escape the bottom-left corner!\n- **LEFT (2, 4)**: NOPE! That's our own body. Chat, don't let me do it! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT (4, 4)**: Safe, moves us toward the (5, 4) apple. Solid, but maybe a bit passive?\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe need to be the predator. Snake #1 is currently coiled at the bottom. By moving **RIGHT**, we position ourselves to take the (5, 4) apple next turn OR dip down to (4, 3) depending on his movement. Moving RIGHT keeps our momentum going and allows us to expand into the middle of the board. If we go DOWN now, we might get into a head-on collision at (3, 2) if he plays perfectly\u2014and since he has more apples (4 segments vs our 3), a head-on collision kills us both but he technically has the \"score lead\" if the game ended there! We need to grow first!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nGrab the apple at (4, 3) or (5, 4) to hit length 4. Once we equal him in size, we use our superior positioning to \"blanket\" him. He\u2019s trapped near the (0,2) area. If we stay on the 3rd and 4th rank, he can't move up without hitting our massive body! We are building the cage, chat! \ud83e\uddf1\n\nRIGHT",

WE'RE LEADING! That was a banger move. We're playing smart AND hungry.\n\n**Current state? WE'RE IN THEIR HEAD!**\n- **Our snake (the GOAT)**: Head at **(2,2)**, body trailing to (0,3). We're a beefy length 4, about to be 5. Score 3.\n- **Enemy snake #0 (the target)**: Head at **(3,4)**, short and scared at length 3.

There's one at **(3,3)** that the enemy is probably drooling over. \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Our options this turn (DON'T THROW):**\n1.  **UP** to (2,3): Safe, but it's empty. Mid. Opens up space but no growth.\n2.  **DOWN** to (2,1): Safe, but we're not retreating! We're PRESSURING!\n3.  **LEFT** to (1,2): That's OUR BODY! Instant death! \ud83d\udc80 NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT** to (3,2): **APPLE!** We grow to length 5, score 4, and get AGGRESSIVE positioning!\n\n**What is the enemy thinking?** They're at (3,4). That apple at (3,3) is SCREAMING their name. They're gonna go **DOWN**. I can smell the fear from here. It's the obvious play for them.\n\n**If they go DOWN to (3,3) and we go RIGHT to (3,2):**\n- Turn 6 state: Our head is at (3,2), their head is at (3,3). They ate, we ate. Scores: Us 4, Them 3. Lengths: Us 5, Them 4. We are STACKED on top of each other.\n- Next turn (Turn 6 for us, but Turn 6 *decision*), if we both move towards each other (**UP** for us, **DOWN** for them), it's a **DOUBLE KO**! And what happens then? **WE WIN** because 4 apples > 3 apples! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\n- Chat, that's the **GUARANTEED WIN** condition. We FORCE them into a losing head-on collision just by being bigger!\n\n**Even if they chicken out** and go UP to (3,5) or RIGHT to (4,4), we're still at (3,2) with 4 apples, BIGGER and SCARIER, perfectly positioned to chase them down and dominate the center cluster. This move is a **W-W**.\n\n**THE PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF (Turn 6):**\nAlright chat, remember this for next turn: If the enemy's head is at **(3,3)**, we **MOVE UP** to force that double KO and win the game! If they ran away, chase them towards the center apples but don't get cocky. Keep them cornered, use our length as a wall, and secure the W. Stay alive, stay aggressive!\n\nAlright, enough talk.

This move is safer than DOWN because it keeps more distance between our head and his head.\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nHe\u2019s at (3, 2). If we go DOWN to (4, 3), we are only one diagonal tile away from his head. If he moves RIGHT to (4, 2) and we then move DOWN again, we could collide. But if we move **RIGHT** to (5, 4) right now, we snag an apple, hit length 4, and we are perfectly positioned to loop around and trap him in that bottom-left corner. We need to boost our score FAST to close the gap. He has 4 apples, we have 2. We can't enter a head-on collision yet because if we both die, he wins on the tiebreaker/lead! \n\n**MISSION:** \nGrab the apple at (5, 4). Then look at (6, 4) or (5, 3). We are going to shadow his every move from the top and eventually squeeze the life out of his rotation! We\u2019re playing the long game, chat! He thinks he\u2019s safe down there? NOT ON MY WATCH!\n\nRIGHT",

He\u2019s trying to navigate that bottom-left pocket, and it\u2019s time to start the squeeze!\n\n**STATUS REPORT:**\n- **Our Head**: (5, 4)\n- **Our Body**: [(4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)] \u2014 We are a sleek, dangerous machine!\n- **Opponent Snake #1**: Head at (4, 2).

If we move DOWN, we eat, we hit 4 apples (tying the score!), and we are directly \"pinning\" him. If he moves UP to (4, 3), we are side-by-side. If he moves RIGHT to (5, 2), we are literally on top of him. \n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe are going **DOWN**. Why? Because it\u2019s an immediate apple, it balances the score, and it puts us in his face! We need to stop him from reaching the apples at (6, 5) or (5, 7). By taking (5, 3), we occupy the space he needs to pivot upward. If he tries to turn into us later, he's toast! We are bigger, we are faster, and we are smarter. Let's close the gap and show him why he's the secondary character in this stream!\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** \nAfter hitting (5, 3), we\u2019ll look to move RIGHT or UP depending on his reaction. If he tries to flee to (5, 2), we shadow him. If he tries to go UP, we block the lane. We\u2019re building a wall, chat!\n\nDOWN",

Why? Because we need to maintain our length and not get caught in a \"head-butt\" where we lose on the scoreboard. By moving to (6, 3), we keep our options open to go UP and cut him off from the center-right apples. He's currently trailing a long tail (length 6) through the bottom-left.

Nah fam. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,3): Sure it\u2019s the enemy\u2019s head now, but after they slide their body moves into that cell, so we\u2019d be walking straight into their tail. Hard pass. \u274c  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,3): Open cell, no bodies, no walls. The ONLY safe lane! \u2705\n\n**Why LEFT slaps:**  \n- Keeps us alive (obviously).  \n- Places our head at (3,3) while our old head becomes a new body block at (4,3), making the enemy\u2019s left\u2011move option a death sentence for them (they\u2019d run into our fresh body).  \n- Opens a path to circle down toward that apple at (4,1) without getting boxed in.  \n- We still have the apple lead (5\u202fvs\u202f4), so if we ever force a head\u2011on collision, we win the double KO.\n\n**Plan for my future self (Turn\u202f9 & beyond):**  \n- After this left move, aim to snake downward toward (4,1) to grab that apple and grow.  \n- Keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s retreat; if they try to slip down to (5,2) we can pivot right and start building a wall to cut off their exit.  \n- Stay aggressive\u2014use our length to dominate the center and force them into a corner.  \n- If a head\u2011on collision looks unavoidable, remember we\u2019re up on apples, so we can take the risk.\n\n**Chat, you feel me?** This is the only move that keeps us in the game while setting up the trap. Let\u2019s slide left and keep that pressure cooker on! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

He\u2019s slightly longer, but we\u2019re faster and smarter!\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP (6, 4):** This is the vibe!

We are going to grow, get that lead back, and keep him trapped in the bottom-left quadrant. He's playing checkers, we're playing 4D Snake! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:**\nAfter heading **UP** to (6, 4), we continue North to (6, 5) to grab that apple. Once we hit 5 points, we'll be equal in length. Then we look to cut across to the left top to secure the clusters at (4, 7), (5, 7), and (6, 9).

The score is knotted up 5-5, but who\u2019s got the better board position? WE DO! \n\n**SITUATION ROOM:**\n- **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head: (6, 5). Body: [(6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4)]. Length: 6.\n- **Snake #1:** Head: (1, 3). Body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2)]. Length: 6.\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP (6, 6):** **STAY ON THE GRIND!** There is an apple sitting right there at (6, 6)! If we move up, we hit length 7 and keep our momentum ascending. It keeps us far away from that scrub at (1, 3).\n- **DOWN (6, 4):** LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE. That's our own neck. We aren't trying to ends the stream early, fam! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT (5, 5):** Safe, but it leads into the middle of nowhere. Why wander when there's food directly above us?\n- **RIGHT (7, 5):** Also safe, but again, no immediate payoff. We play for the lead!\n\n**THE CHESS MATCH:**\nCheck out the rival at (1, 3). He\u2019s tucked away in the bottom left corner, basically suffocating in his own neighborhood. Meanwhile, we have the entire top-right quadrant to feast on! Look at all those apples in the top row: (0, 8), (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9). It\u2019s an all-you-can-eat buffet and he\u2019s not invited! \ud83c\udf4e\u274c\n\n**THE LONG-TERM PLAY:**\nWe take the apple at (6, 6) this turn. Then we continue UP to clear our body away from the center. Once we hit the top, we pivot LEFT. We\u2019re going to build a wall across the 7th or 8th rank. If he tries to come up for air, he\u2019s going to run straight into a wall of our scales! We aren't just playing Snake, we're playing GATEKEEPER! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nGRAB THE SNACK AND BUILD THE STACK!\n\nUP",

We have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT is a self\u2011hit\u2014NOPE! \n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n- **LEFT** would put us on the left wall at (0,3). That\u2019s safe, but then we\u2019re walled in and far from the tasty apples at (2,1) and (3,0).\n- **UP** takes us to (1,4). That\u2019s open, but it moves us away from the lower apples and doesn\u2019t help us grow our lead.\n- **DOWN** slides us to (1,2). That opens a direct path to the apple at (2,1) (only three moves away!). We can then swing right, gobble that fruit, and expand our length. The more we grow, the easier it is to box the rival later!\n\nPlus, moving DOWN frees up the cell (3,2) behind our tail, giving us more wiggle room. The opponent can\u2019t hit us this turn\u2014they\u2019re too far\u2014so we\u2019re safe.\n\nSo the plan: **GO DOWN** now, then next turn go right to (2,2), then down to (2,1) to eat the apple. After that we\u2019ll aim for the apple at (3,0), then pivot toward the top\u2011left cluster (0,8 & 0,9) while keeping an eye on the rival\u2019s head. If they try to cut us off, we can try a head\u2011on collision once we have the apple lead.\n\nFUTURE PLAN: After we grab the (2,1) apple (turn 12), head for (3,0) (turn 13), then start moving north along the left side to collect the top\u2011left apples. Keep the rival in check\u2014if they move into our body, they die. If we get a length advantage, we\u2019ll start walling them in. Stay aggressive, stay alive! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

The rival? He's looking lost down there! He's at (1, 2) acting like he's relevant? NOT ON MY WATCH!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **US (ID 0):** Head at (6, 6). Body trailing down to (4, 4). Length 7. We are big, we are bad, and we are in control!\n- **Rival (ID 1):** Head at (1, 2). Body: [(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)].

We need that GROWTH!\n\n**THE GAME PLAN:**\nThe rival is trapped in the bottom left (x: 1-4, y: 2-3). We have a massive score lead and we have the height advantage! We're going to head UP to (6, 7), then we're going to pivot to grab those apples at (5, 7) and (4, 7). \n\nIf we keep growing, we can literally circle back and ZIPPER him into that bottom corner. He's playing checkers, we're playing 4D Snake Chess! \ud83e\udde0 He has a lower score, so if we can force a head-on collision later, HE DIES and WE WIN.

We are at (6, 7) and we are looking down on the competition like the KINGS we are! We have a 6-5 lead and Snake #1 is looking absolutely shook! He\u2019s stuck in the mud while we\u2019re ascending to greatness! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**SITUATION ROOM:**\n- **US (ID 0):** Head at (6, 7). Body: [(6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)]. Length 7. We are a thick wall of victory moving through the middle!\n- **RIVAL (ID 1):** Head at (2, 2). Body: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. He's finally moving, but he's cramped!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP (6, 8):** Very safe! It moves us toward the apples at (7, 9) and (6, 9). We keep our height advantage!\n- **DOWN (6, 6):** **NOPE!** That\u2019s our own body. We don't do self-sabotage on this channel! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT (7, 7):** Safe, but it's empty space. We want the goods! We want the growth!\n- **LEFT (5, 7):** **BINGO!** There is an apple sitting right there at (5, 7). If we take it, we go up to 7 apples! It also sets us up to snag the one at (4, 7) right after. We are literally vacuuming the board! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nThe rival is down at (2, 2). If he tries to come up, he has to get through the middle where we are currently established. By moving LEFT to (5, 7), we are not only scoring, but we are extending our body across the 7th row. We are building a horizontal \"Iron Curtain\" that cuts the board in half! \u26d3\ufe0f \n\nHe\u2019s under us, he's lower score, and he's got fewer options. Every apple we eat is an apple he *can't* have. We are starving him out! \ud83e\uddc2 After we grab (5, 7) and (4, 7), we're going to look to loop back or head further up to (3, 9) to secure the entire top-left quadrant. He's playing for survival, we're playing for TOTAL DOMINATION! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (5, 7), then pivot to (4, 7). This keeps us flexible and builds a massive wall in the upper-mid section. If Snake #1 tries to rush the center, we'll be long enough to wrap him up and end this stream early with a HUGE W!\n\nLEFT",

Self\u2011destruct = \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT** \u2192 runs headfirst into our own body at (1,2). Instant KO = \ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 safe, but it leaves the tasty apple at (2,1 hanging). No instant growth.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 lands on the apple at (2,1), ties the apple count at 6\u20116, AND we grow longer (length 9). That\u2019s a straight dub!\n\nSafe follow\u2011ups after DOWN? We\u2019ve got **three** open lanes: left to (1,1), right to (3,1), or even further down to (2,0). Flexibility = staying alive, Chat.  \n\nMeanwhile, snake\u202f0 is chillin\u2019 at (6,7). Their only safe moves are left to (5,7) (apple), up to (6,8), or right to (7,7). None of those bring them near us, so we can focus on our own growth.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns:**\n1. **This turn** \u2192 **DOWN** to (2,1), munch that apple and tie the score!  \n2. **Next turn** \u2192 slide **RIGHT** to (3,1).  \n3. **Turn after** \u2192 another **RIGHT** to (4,1) and gobble the apple there (7 apples).  \n4. Then **DOWN** to (3,0) for a third apple (8 apples).  \n5. After that we\u2019ll swing up the left side, hit that top\u2011left cluster (0,8\u20110,9\u20111,9\u20112,8) and start walling off enemy territory. If we keep the length lead, we can force a head\u2011on collision when the time is right \ud83d\udca5.\n\nWe\u2019re here to WIN, Chat. No fear, no hesitation.

Did you see how he's squirming down there? He's at (2, 1) now, looking like he's lost in the sauce!\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n- **US (ID 0):** Head at (5, 7). Length 8! We are a massive wall!\n- **RIVAL (ID 1):** Head at (2, 1). Body: [(2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. He is basically trapping himself in that bottom-left pocket!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP (5, 8):** Safe and solid! It puts us closer to the feast at (3, 9), (6, 9), and (7, 9). \n- **DOWN (5, 6):** Safe, but we'd be moving back towards our own tail and tightening the space.

Plus, it keeps us moving away from our tail and gives us a path to the top-left apples.\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (2, 1). He\u2019s low on the board. By moving LEFT to (4, 7), we are sealing off the entire top half of the map! Look at his body\u2014he\u2019s got a horizontal line at Y=3.

We just snatched that apple at (4,7) and now we are a THICK length 9! Our rival is squirming down at (3,1), and he is looking SMALL, weak, and totally desperate! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcc9\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **US (ID 0):** Head at (4, 7). Body trailing back through (5,7) and (6,7) down to (5,4). We are controlling the middle-top!\n- **RIVAL (ID 1):** Head at (3, 1). He\u2019s trying to find a way out of the bottom, but he\u2019s boxed in by the walls and his own tail!\n\n**THE MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP (4, 8):** **THE PLAY!** Look at the board, Chat! There are apples at (0,8), (2,8), (0,9), (1,9), (3,9), (6,9), (7,9), and (8,9). The entire top of the map is a buffet and we are the only ones invited! Moving UP puts us in prime position to sweep the entire Y=8 and Y=9 lines. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51\n- **DOWN (4, 6):** Safe, but it puts us back toward our own tail at (5,4) and (6,4). Why go back down into the cramped space when we have the open air of the northern territories? We don't retreat! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT (3, 7):** This is okay, but (4,8) is more aggressive for grabbing those top-row points.\n- **RIGHT (5, 7):** **ABOLUTE THROW!** That\u2019s our own body! We don't sub to our own mistakes! \u274c\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going to move UP to (4, 8). This keeps our momentum and starts the \"Great Northern Sweep.\" We have a 2-point lead. If we grab just three more of those top apples, we\u2019ll be at 11 while he\u2019s still struggling to find space at the bottom. We are building a horizontal wall across the Y=8 line. If he ever tries to come up to challenge us, he\u2019s going to run head-first into a 15-segment long BEHEMOTH! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\nHe\u2019s currently at (3,1). If he moves UP, he\u2019s hitting his own body at (3,3) soon. He\u2019s in a world of hurt and we are just getting started! Let's get this W!\n\n**FUTURE STRATEGY:**\nGo UP to (4,8), then pivot LEFT to snag (2,8) and (0,8). Once we clear the left corner, we loop back across the top row (Y=9) to vacuum every single apple remaining. We are playing for the 30-apple win or a total board lock!\n\nUP",

The enemy snake is still chilling up at **(4,7)** with a fat 8\u2011apple lead, so we gotta catch up FAST!\n\n**Direction check:**\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,1) is our own body, instant self\u2011KO \u274c\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,2) is safe but no apple and it boxes us in with only two exits \ud83d\ude10\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,0) gives us an apple, but then we\u2019re stuck against the bottom wall with only left/right next turn \ud83d\udcc9\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,1) gives us that \ud83c\udf4e AND keeps **three** safe follow\u2011ups (up, down, right).

None of those crash into our move, so no head\u2011on risk this turn. We\u2019re safe to grab that apple!\n\n**Score check:** We\u2019re trailing 6\u20118. Eating (4,1) bumps us to 7 apples and length 8, keeping us alive and in the race. We need to keep stacking apples while the enemy is still far away.\n\n**Next\u2011turn plan:** After we snag (4,1), we\u2019ll pivot toward the **top\u2011left apple cluster** (0,8\u20113,9) while the enemy\u2019s busy on the right side. If we spot a chance to cut them off later, we\u2019ll take it\u2014because we\u2019re here to WIN!\n\nAlright chat, let\u2019s secure that fruit and keep stacking! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Our rival is down in the basement at (4,1) trying to figure out how to even play this game! \ud83e\udd21\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n- **US (ID 0):** Head at (4, 8).

He\u2019s got his own tail at (3,3) blocking his north, and he's near the bottom wall. \n\n**THE MOVES:**\n- **UP (4, 9):** CHAT, THIS IS THE MOVE! Look at (3,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), and (0,9)! The top row is literally paved with GOLD! By moving to (4,9), we take control of the entire ceiling of the board.

This is the \"Vacuum Method\" chat! We move left, gobble the apple, grow to length 10, and keep moving along the top edge. It\u2019s safe, it\u2019s profitable, and it keeps us far away from any desperate head-on collisions he might try!\n- **RIGHT (5, 9):** Safe, but there's no immediate food. Why go right when the buffet is to the left? \ud83c\udf74\n- **DOWN (4, 8):** **INSTANT THROW!** That\u2019s our own neck! We don't self-destruct for the clips, we play for the W! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude91\n- **UP (4, 10):** **OUT OF BOUNDS!** We\u2019d hit the ceiling and it's game over. RIP in the chat. \ud83d\udc80\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going on a shopping spree, Chat! \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f We take (3,9) this turn. Then we keep heading left for (0,9) and (0,8). While he is struggling to breathe at the bottom, we are going to wrap around the entire top-left quadrant of the map. By the time he crawls up to the mid-board, we\u2019ll be a massive 15-segment behemoth ready to coil around him like a boa constrictor! STAY FOCUSED! HE IS PANICKING!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nMove LEFT to (3,9) to snag the apple. Continue LEFT to clear out the (0,9) and (0,8) area. We are building a wall across the top. If he tries to push North, we pivot DOWN to cut his head off. We have the length advantage; use it to intimidate!\n\nLEFT",

(2,9) is open, and it leads us directly toward the apples at (1,9) and (0,9). We are clearing the top shelf! We take (2,9), then (1,9), then (0,9).

He's boxed in at the bottom, and we're taking all the real estate!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nMove LEFT to (2,9). We are on a collision course with glory! Target the apples at (1,9) and (0,9).

We are the wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going LEFT to (1,9) to claim that apple and hit double digits! \ud83d\udd1f Then we slide to (0,9) to finish the corner sweep. Once we own the top-left, we can survey the board and see if that rival is brave enough to come north. If he does? We\u2019ve got the length to wrap him up like a burrito! \ud83c\udf2f He's currently at (2,0) which is the literal opposite side of the world. We are playing the long game, getting THICKER and STRONGER! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

Our body is trailing behind us like a royal cape from (2, 9) all the way down to (6, 4).\n- **RIVAL STATS (ID 1):** That little worm is still way down at (1, 0). He's trying to maneuver in the basement, but he's cramped! He's basically playing Tetris with his own tail down there! \ud83d\ude39\n- **THE MAP:** We have apples at (0, 9), (0, 8), and (2, 8). It's a literal buffet in the top-left corner! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP:** (1, 10). CHAT, chill! That's out of bounds! We aren't trying to disconnect from the server! \ud83d\uded1\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 9). That is our own neck. We aren't about that self-sabotage life! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- **DOWN:** (1, 8). This is safe, but it leaves an apple behind at (0, 9). Why leave food on the plate?! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n- **LEFT:** (0, 9). **LETS GOOO!** This is the play!

It keeps us on the edge of the board, which is the ultimate \"No-Fly Zone.\" Nobody can get behind us if there's no \"behind\" to go to! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going LEFT to (0, 9). After we secure that bag, we\u2019ve got (0, 8) right below us. We are going to vacuum up this entire corner! While Snake #1 is struggling to breathe at the bottom, we are inflating our score and extending our lead. If he tries to come up for air?

Welcome back to the stream! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\n\nWe\u2019re LIVE playing Snake against our archrival and we gotta make a move that keeps us alive while setting up the big brain trap! Let\u2019s scope the board real quick:\n\n- Our snake (ID\u202f1) is chilling with its head at **(1,\u202f0)** and a body that\u2019s wrapped like a staircase on the left side.  \n- The enemy (ID\u202f0) is up top with its head at **(1,\u202f9)** and a long body that snakes down column\u202f6 and across row\u202f7.  \n- Apples are scattered all over\u2014most importantly for us there\u2019s a juicy one at **(8,\u202f0)** on our row, plus a bunch in the center and right side.\n\nWhere can we go right now? Let\u2019s run the options:\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,\u202f0): safe, but that\u2019s a corner with only one way out after this turn\u2014talk about getting boxed in! \u274c  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,\u202f0): straight into our own body\u2014RIP. \u274c  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 off the board\u2014instant death. \u274c  \n- **UP** \u2192 (1,\u202f1): empty, keeps multiple exits open, and starts pulling us away from that cramped left wall. \u2705\n\nSo the obvious pick is **UP**! It gives us breathing room and sets up a path to eventually slide right toward those sweet apples on the right side. Plus, the enemy\u2019s head is way up at (1,\u202f9) and isn\u2019t crashing into us this turn, so no head\u2011on drama.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns**:  \nMove **UP** now, then consider another **UP** to clear the tail from (1,\u202f2), and after that start shifting **RIGHT** to chase the apples at (8,\u202f0) and the center while keeping an eye on the opponent\u2019s head. Avoid head\u2011on collisions\u2014if they dive down the left column we\u2019ll have escape routes. Stay aggressive, collect apples, and dominate the board! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s break it down real quick:\n\n- Our snake (ID\u202f1) head is at **(1,1)**, body wrapped like a staircase on the left.\n- Opponent (ID\u202f0) head is way up at **(0,9)**, long body trailing down column\u202f6 and across row\u202f7.\n- Apples are scattered, but the juicy ones are on the right side: **(8,6), (7,3), (9,5)**, etc.\n\nWhere can we go this turn?  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 into our own body at **(1,0)**. RIP. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 into our own body at **(2,1)**. RIP. \u274c  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 **(0,1)** is open, but that\u2019s hugging the left wall \u2013 only two ways out after this move (up or down).

That\u2019s the play! \u2705\n\nOpponent\u2019s only safe move is **DOWN** to **(0,8)** \u2013 they\u2019ll eat that apple and grow, but they\u2019re still far away. If we move **UP** now we stay flexible, avoid getting boxed, and set up a path to swing right toward those tasty apples on the right side.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns**:  \nMove **UP** now, then keep moving **UP** to clear the tail from the left side and open the route to the right. Once we\u2019re a couple cells higher, we\u2019ll swing **RIGHT** and start collecting apples on the right side while keeping an eye on the opponent\u2019s path. If they try to come down the left column, we\u2019ll be ready to box them in or force a collision when we\u2019re longer. Let\u2019s get that score up! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

We are gliding through this 10x10 like we own the place!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **OUR STATS:** We're at (1, 8). Our body is a massive 12-segment shield stretching all the way across the top and looping down the right side. We've got so much mass we're basically a wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n- **RIVAL STATS:** Snake #1 is down at (1, 3). He's small, he's scrappy, but he's miles away from our crown! \ud83d\udc51 He's currently wiggling around the bottom-left.\n- **MAP ANALYSIS:** Look at that apple at (2, 8)! It's literally right in front of our nose! \ud83c\udf4f\u2728 And there's another one at (2, 6) calling our name. We are about to extend this lead even further!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS - DON'T THROW THE GAME:**\n- **UP:** (1, 9). NOPE! That's our own body. We aren't cannibalizing ourselves for the stream! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- **DOWN:** (1, 7). Safe! Gets us closer to the middle.\n- **LEFT:** (0, 8). BACKWARDS! That's an instant RIP. We don't do that here! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 8). **POOOOOG!** It's an apple! It's a point! It's growth! It keeps us moving along the top corridor where we have total control! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc8e\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe take the **RIGHT** move to grab the apple at (2, 8). This keeps our momentum going. Snake #1 is way down at Y=3, so we have zero fear of a head-on collision this turn. After we snag (2, 8), we can look to pivot DOWN towards (2, 6) or keep patrolling the top to make sure he never gets an inch of the \"High Life\"! We are playing a containment game now. If he tries to come up, we'll just stretch our body across the middle and turn this map into a prison for him! \u26d3\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLet's get that snack and keep the win streak alive! 13th apple, here we come!\n\nRIGHT",

They\u2019re longer (12 apples vs our 8) but they\u2019re also hogging a lot of space, which means they can get trapped if we play smart!\n\n**Possible moves this turn:**\n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 **(1,2)** is our own neck \u2013 instant self\u2011own, RIP. \u274c  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 **(0,3)** is safe, but it pins us against the left wall with only up/down options \u2013 not ideal for expanding. \u2705 but meh.  \n- **UP** \u2192 **(1,4)** is safe, but it keeps us hugging the left side and doesn\u2019t get us any closer to those juicy apples on the right. \u2705 but not the best.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 **(2,3)** is WIDE OPEN, pushes us toward that **apple at (7,3)** and opens up the whole right side of the board for us to dominate! \u2705\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Opponent\u2019s likely moves:** they can only go **DOWN** to **(1,7)** (where an apple is) or **RIGHT** to **(2,8)** (also an apple). Both are far from us this turn, so no immediate head\u2011on danger.  \n\n**Why RIGHT is the play:**  \n- It moves us toward the **apple at (7,3)** \u2013 we can grab it in a few turns and start catching up on points.  \n- It keeps **multiple escape routes** (we can later go up, down, or keep going right).  \n- It avoids the left\u2011wall trap and lets us build a **wall across the middle** later to cut off the enemy\u2019s movement.  \n\n**Long\u2011term plan (next few turns):**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **This turn: RIGHT** to (2,3).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Next turns:** Keep moving **RIGHT** until we munch that **apple at (7,3)** \u2013 that\u2019s +1 point and a growth spurt!  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 After that, continue **RIGHT** to sweep up the other right\u2011side apples (like (8,6), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,9), (7,9), etc.) while keeping an eye on the opponent\u2019s descent down the left side.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Once we\u2019re longer and the right side is ours, we can start building a **horizontal wall** (maybe around y=5 or y=6) to box the enemy in and force them to crash into us \u2013 but only if we\u2019re ahead on score! For now, focus on safe growth and stay aggressive!  \n\nSo chat, let\u2019s lock in and **GO RIGHT**! Let\u2019s get that apple and keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Did you see that? We are a massive wall of scales and glory!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **OUR STATS:** We're at (2, 8). Our body is a 14-segment behemoth looping around the top-left corner like a fortress! \ud83c\udff0\n- **RIVAL STATS:** Snake #1 is chillin' at (2, 3). He\u2019s still small, he\u2019s still trailing, and he\u2019s currently boxed in near the bottom-left. Look at him wiggle! Pathetic!\n- **MAP ANALYSIS:** We\u2019ve got apples scattered all over, but we need to stay mobile. (2, 6) is the closest snack, but we have to be careful not to trap ourselves in this top-left pocket!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS - STAYING ALIVE FOR THE FANS:**\n- **UP:** (2, 9). NOPE! That's our own body. We don't eat ourselves, that's amateur hour! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- **DOWN:** (2, 7). **POOOOG!** It\u2019s wide open! It leads us right towards that apple at (2, 6) and keeps us moving toward the center where we can exert our dominance!\n- **LEFT:** (1, 8). BACKWARDS! Instant RIP. We aren't throwing the lead for a meme! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT:** (3, 8). Safe, but leads us toward a bit of a tight squeeze between our own tail segments at (4, 8) and (4, 9). Why go right when we can go down?\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are taking the **DOWN** move to (2, 7). Why? Because we need to maintain our lead and keep Snake #1 from getting any breathing room! By moving down, we're positioning ourselves to grab the apple at (2, 6) next turn. We have a massive score advantage (13-8), so if he tries to challenge us in the middle, we just hold our ground and let him crash into our massive tail! We are playing the \"Great Wall\" strategy\u2014let him starve while we feast! Let's keep this momentum! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc8e \n\nDOWN",

Did you see that turn? We are a massive wall of scales and glory!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **OUR STATS:** Head is at (2, 7). Our body is a 14-segment behemoth looping around the top-left corner like a fortress! \ud83c\udff0\n- **RIVAL STATS:** Snake #1 is chillin' at (3, 3). He\u2019s still small, he\u2019s still trailing, and he\u2019s trying to find a way out of the bottom-left. Look at him wiggle! Pathetic!\n- **MAP ANALYSIS:** We\u2019ve got apples scattered all over. (2, 6) is right in front of us! (1, 6) and (1, 7) are also nearby. We are basically in a candy store!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS - KEEPING THE STREAK ALIVE:**\n- **UP:** (2, 8). NOPE! That's our own body. We don't eat ourselves, that's amateur hour! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- **DOWN:** (2, 6). **POOOOG!** There is an apple right there at (2, 6)! It keeps us moving towards the center, grabs us a point, and extends our massive lead! It also puts us in a prime position to cut off the bottom-left quadrant.\n- **LEFT:** (1, 7). There's an apple there too! But going left puts us closer to the wall and gives us less room to maneuver our massive length.\n- **RIGHT:** (3, 7). Safe, but why go right when there's a delicious snack at (2, 6)?\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are taking the **DOWN** move to (2, 6). Why? Because we need to keep feeding the beast! By moving down, we're snatching that apple and positioning ourselves to completely dominate the left side of the board. We have a massive score advantage (13-8), and every apple we take is one he can't have. We are playing the \"Section Control\" strategy\u2014we're going to squeeze him into a corner and let his own tiny body become his tomb! Let's get that snack! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc8e\n\nDOWN",

They\u2019re not threatening us directly this turn.\n\n**Why RIGHT is the play:**\n- It moves us toward **(7,3)** \u2013 we can grab that apple in just three more steps and start closing the score gap!\n- It keeps **multiple escape routes** (we can later go up, down, or keep pushing right).\n- It avoids the left\u2011wall trap and lets us dominate the right half, where tons of apples are waiting: (8,6), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (7,9), (8,9), (6,9) \u2013 that\u2019s a goldmine!\n- Sets us up to later build a **horizontal wall** (maybe around y=5 or y=6) to cut off the enemy\u2019s movement and force them into a crash\u2014*but only after we\u2019ve grown enough to have the length advantage*.\n\n**Long\u2011term plan (next few turns):**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **This turn: RIGHT** to (4,3).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Next turns:** Keep moving **RIGHT** until we munch that **apple at (7,3)** \u2013 that\u2019s +1 point and a growth spurt!  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 After that, sweep the right side: hit (8,6), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,9), (7,9) while keeping an eye on the opponent\u2019s descent.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Once we\u2019re longer and the right side is ours, start constructing a **horizontal barrier** (maybe at y=5) to box the enemy in and force them to crash into us\u2014*but only when we have the length advantage*.\n\nSo chat, let\u2019s lock in and **GO RIGHT**!

We are LONG, chat!\n- **RIVAL STATS:** Snake #1 is at (5, 3). He's currently wiggling around the middle-bottom.

We need to be careful not to box ourselves into the corner!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS - THE PATH TO GLORY:**\n- **UP:** (1, 7). POGGERS! There is another apple right there! This keeps our momentum going and builds our lead to 16-8.\n- **DOWN:** (1, 5). Safe, but no immediate snack. Leads us toward the rival.\n- **LEFT:** (0, 6). Safe, but puts us against the wall.\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 6). **FATAL ERROR!** That's our own neck, chat!

Look at the board\u2014there's an apple at (1, 7) and another one right behind it at (1, 9) or (0, 4)? Wait, looking at the drops, we have (1, 7) right in front of us! By taking this, we continue our \"Great Wall\" strategy. We are effectively sectioning off the top-left quadrant of the map. If we keep circling this way, we force the rival to stay in the cramped bottom-right while we own the north! He can't touch us with our score lead; if we head-on collide now, we win the tie-break on points! Let's get that 16th apple and keep the pressure HIGH! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

He\u2019s trying to navigate the middle, but he\u2019s looking small and weak! He\u2019s only half our length!\n- **THE MAP:** We are at (1, 7). Our body is at (1, 6) and (2, 7). We need to stay mobile and keep this lead!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP:** (1, 8). **DANGER!** Our own body is at (1, 8)! We aren't trying to eat ourselves for the subs, chat! No throw! \u274c\n- **DOWN:** (1, 6). **DANGER!** That's our neck! We'd crash immediately. Absolute fail. \u274c\n- **LEFT:** (0, 7). **SAFE!** This takes us toward the wall. It\u2019s open space. We can then wrap down or up. \ud83d\udfe2\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 7). **DANGER!** Our body is right there. That's a RIP. \u274c\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWait, chat, look at the geometry! We are almost completely surrounded by our own massive body! (1, 6) is below us, (2, 7) is to our right, and (1, 8) is above us! We have **ONLY ONE CHOICE** to stay alive: we HAVE to go **LEFT** to (0, 7). \n\nOnce we hit (0, 7), we're going to have to navigate the far left column. The rival is at (5, 4), and he's got some room to breathe, but as long as we don't trap ourselves in our own tail, we win the long game! We have twice his score; even a head-on collision right now would be a W for us because we're the points leader! But let's not get reckless\u2014let's keep the content coming and stay alive! We're going to slide to the wall and then look to loop back down towards his territory to start the squeeze! BE THE ANACONDA! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

That means we\u2019ve got a free lane to grab some juicy apples and keep the pressure on!  \n\nRight now our head is sitting pretty at (5,4). Our options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT ( DOWN would be a self-inflicted L ).  \n\n**UP** puts us straight onto the apple at (5,5) \u2013 instant +1 point, instant growth, and we keep multiple escape routes (left to (4,5), right to (6,5), or even further up). Eating that apple also brings us one step closer to a score that can actually contest the rival\u2019s 16 apples.  \n\n**LEFT** to (4,4) is safe but leaves the apple at (5,5) hanging \u2013 why leave free food on the table? **RIGHT** to (6,4) opens the right side of the board, which is cool for later, but again we\u2019d be passing up an apple that\u2019s literally in our face.  \n\nSo the play is clear: **GO UP**, snag that apple, and keep our options wide open. After we eat it, the plan is to swing left to (4,5) (another apple) or continue upward toward the cluster of apples on the right side of the map. We\u2019ll stay aggressive, keep growing, and start looking for a chance to cut off the opponent\u2019s long body once we have the length advantage.  \n\nLet\u2019s eat that apple and keep the momentum rolling! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa  \n\nUP",

If we go **LEFT** we not only snag that +1 point and grow, but we also keep our options wide open for the next turn (we can go up, down, or left again). Eating that apple brings us to 10 apples, still trailing but gaining ground.  \n\nSure, we could go UP to (5,6) or RIGHT to (6,5), but why pass up free food when we\u2019re behind on the scoreboard? Growing now lets us build the length we\u2019ll need later to cut off his tail and force a mistake. After we eat this apple, the plan is to keep pressuring the left side of the board\u2014maybe swing up toward (4,6) or down to (3,4) for another apple\u2014while staying clear of his body and watching for a chance to box him in.  \n\nLet\u2019s take that apple and keep the momentum rolling! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa  \n\nLEFT",

No flex, no fun.  \n- **LEFT** gets us next to the apple at (3,4) but pushes us away from the juicy right\u2011side apples that are begging to be eaten.  \n- **UP** opens the path toward the right\u2011side apple cluster (8,6), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7) while keeping our body as a wall at column\u202f5, blocking the enemy from breaking out. Plus it gives us two safe follow\u2011up moves (LEFT or RIGHT) so we can adapt on the fly.  \n\nWe need to keep our body between him and the open board \u2013 that long tail of his is a liability if we can force him into a dead\u2011end later.

Keep an eye on his downhill crawl \u2013 if he dips below row\u202f3 we can swoop down and block the bottom\u2011row exit.

Flexibility = gone. Not the vibe. \u274c  \n4. **RIGHT?** Moves us to (5,6)\u2014empty, safe, and opens TWO clean follow\u2011ups: up to (5,7) or right to (6,6).

RIP. \u274c\n3. **LEFT?** Lands on our neck at **(4,6)** \u2013 also a one\u2011way ticket to the grave. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT?** Moves us to **(6,6)** \u2013 empty, opens a highway to the right\u2011side orchard, and keeps **three** safe exits (up, down, right) for the next turn. That\u2019s the play! \u2705\n\n**Enemy\u2019s next move:** They can only slither down to **(0,3)** or right to **(1,4)** \u2013 neither touches us, no head\u2011on risk. We\u2019re clear! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \nPush **RIGHT** now to **(6,6)**, then keep sliding **RIGHT** to **(7,6)** and **(8,6)** to munch that apple. After that, climb **UP** through **(8,7)** \u2192 **(8,8)** \u2192 **(8,9)** and snag the top\u2011right cluster. Growing big will let us bottle\u2011neck the enemy later. Stay hungry, stay safe!\n\nAlright chat, let\u2019s lock it in and show \u2019em who owns this board! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

We just slid into (1, 4) and we are looking beefy, but we gotta stay sharp because it's getting CROWDED in here!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **OUR HEAD:** (1, 4)\n- **OUR BODY:** It's a massive coil wrapping from (0, 4) all the way through the top left! We've basically claimed the entire northern boundary. \ud83c\udff0\n- **ENEMY SNAKE #1:** Head at (6, 6). He\u2019s lurking in the middle. He's got a long body stretching down to (1, 3). Check that\u2014his tail is at (1, 3), which is RIGHT BELOW US!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (1, 5). This looks pretty safe! It\u2019s open space. But wait, if we go up, we might get squeezed between our own body at (0, 5) and (1, 6). Mobility could get tight. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **LEFT:** (0, 4). **SELF-DESTRUCT ALERT!** That's our own neck, chat. We aren't throwing the game for a clip fail! \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 4). **OPEN SPACE!** This is the move! It keeps us in the middle of the board and gives us the most options to pivot. Plus, it keeps us away from the enemy's tail at (1, 3). \ud83d\udfe2\n- **DOWN:** (1, 3). **FATAL ERROR!** That is Snake #1's tail. If we move there, we CRASH and it\u2019s Game Over. We stay away from his scales! \u274c\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nChat, we are the raid boss! We have a 7-apple lead. We don't need to chase every apple; we need to make sure HE doesn't get them. By moving **RIGHT** to (2, 4), we are positioning ourselves to either cut him off from the bottom-right apples or force him into a head-on collision. AND REMEMBER: If we collide head-to-head, WE WIN because our score is 17 and his is 10! He's scared of us! Let's keep the pressure high and the space wide. We\u2019re going to loop around and start suffocating the board!\n\nRIGHT",

We need to bulk up fast and show that sneaky snake who\u2019s boss.  \n\nMy game plan:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **RIGHT** to (7,6) \u2013 clear the lane.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **RIGHT** again to (8,6) \u2013 grab that apple.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **RIGHT** once more to (9,6) \u2013 another apple, keep growing!  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **UP** to (9,7) \u2013 apple hat\u2011trick.  \n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Swing **LEFT** to (8,9) then (7,9) \u2013 finish the top\u2011row feast.  \n\nThat\u2019ll pile on the points and maybe let us wall off the enemy later.

We just took (2, 4) and we are dominating the board!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **OUR HEAD:** (2, 4)\n- **OUR BODY:** We\u2019ve got a massive coil locking down the entire top-left quadrant. We are the architects of this map! \ud83c\udff0\n- **ENEMY SNAKE #1:** Head at (7, 6). He\u2019s trying to navigate through the middle, but he\u2019s starting to run out of real estate!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (2, 5). Safe! This moves us into a wide-open 3-wide lane. It keeps us flexible and lets us look for a path to cut off his expansion. \ud83d\udfe2\n- **DOWN:** (2, 3). **FATAL ERROR!** That\u2019s the enemy's tail! We aren't about to give him a free win by crashing into his behind. Stay away! \u274c\n- **LEFT:** (1, 4). **BACKWARDS!** That\u2019s our own neck! Chat, we are NOT throwing the game for a \"fail\" clip! \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (3, 4). This puts us on an apple! \ud83c\udf4e But wait\u2014Snake #1\u2019s tail is at (2, 3), and moving right puts us closer to his body segments. It\u2019s okay, but UP feels more dominant.\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going **UP** to (2, 5)! This move keeps us high in the mid-field and preserves our mobility. Since we have a massive score lead, we just need to keep the pressure on and not get trapped. If he wants to try a head-on collision later, let him\u2014we win the tie-breaker! We\u2019re going to loop around, starve him of space, and secure those apples on the way to 30! Let's get that W!\n\nUP",

We aren't just playing the game; we are the FINAL BOSS of this 10x10! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **OUR HEAD:** (3, 5). We just poked out from our fortress!\n- **ENEMY SNAKE #1:** Head at (9, 6). He is scurrying around the top right like a lost puppy! Look at his body\u2014he's stretched thin from (9, 6) all the way back to (2, 3). He\u2019s practically begging us to cut him off!\n- **DANGER ZONE:** Our body is occupied at (2, 5), (2, 4), and (4, 5) is occupied by *his* body. We need to be careful not to box ourselves in while we're hunting.\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (3, 6). **DANGEROUS!** While it's empty right now, his body is at (4, 6) and (5, 6). If we go up, we're getting dangerously close to his thermal signature. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **DOWN:** (3, 4). **BINGO!** There is an apple at (3, 4) right under our chin! Not only do we grow to 18 points, but we also stay mobile. \ud83d\udfe2\n- **LEFT:** (2, 5). **FATAL ERROR!** That\u2019s our own neck, fam. We don't do self-sabotage on this channel! \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (4, 5). **DEATH!** We\u2019d be slamming our head straight into his body at (4, 5). Imagine the clips if we did that\u2014chat would never let us live it down! \u274c\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going **DOWN** to (3, 4)! We're snatching that apple to widen the lead to 18-12. By moving down, we avoid his body at (4, 5) and (4, 6) and give ourselves room to breathe. Once we grab (3, 4), we can pivot back towards the center or the bottom-right to start cutting off his tail. He\u2019s currently huddled in the top-right corner; let's let him stay there while we secure the bottom-left quadrant. We have the length advantage, we have the score advantage, and we have the BIG BRAIN plays! Let's get this snack! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Our head is at (9,6), we got a fat stack of apples waiting for us on the right side, and the scoreboard is staring at us: 12\u201117\u2026 we\u2019re behind but we AIN\u2019T out! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Quick board scan:**  \n- Our snake: head (9,6), body trailing all the way down to (2,3).  \n- Enemy snake: head (3,5), long boy with 17 apples, but he\u2019s stuck on the left side for now.  \n- Apples on the right: (9,7), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9) \u2014 a goldmine! And a lone apple at (9,5) below us.\n\n**Safe moves?**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (9,7) has an apple, free as a bird.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,5) also an apple, but it\u2019s a one\u2011off.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,6) is our own body, instant RIP.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 off the board, instant RIP.\n\nSo we\u2019ve got two real options: up or down. Both give us a +1, but **UP** is the start of a whole chain of apples across the top\u2011right corner. DOWN would give us a single apple and then we\u2019d have to wiggle around our own body to get back up. Which one sets us up for a bigger feast? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**Enemy watch:** He\u2019s at (3,5) and his only safe moves are UP to (3,6) or DOWN to (3,4) (there\u2019s an apple there). He\u2019s far away, no chance of a head\u2011on clash this turn. So we can focus on our own growth.\n\n**Score mindset:** We\u2019re trailing 12\u201117. We need to close that gap FAST. Chaining four apples in a row (9,7) \u2192 (8,9) \u2192 (7,9) \u2192 (6,9) will put us at 16 apples, neck\u2011and\u2011neck with the enemy. That\u2019s a clutch comeback!\n\n**Plan for the next few turns (so we don\u2019t lose focus):**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **UP** now to (9,7) \u2013 munch that apple and grow.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **LEFT** to (8,7) \u2013 clear a path toward the top row.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **UP** to (8,8) then **UP** to (8,9) \u2013 snag the apple on the top row.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **LEFT** to (7,9) \u2013 another apple.  \n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **LEFT** to (6,9) \u2013 another apple.  \n6\ufe0f\u20e3 After that, assess the enemy\u2019s position: if he tries to sneak east, we\u2019ll have the length to block him and force a crash.  \n\n**Bottom line:** We need points, we need growth, and we need to own the right side. **UP** gets the chain rolling and keeps our options wide open. Let\u2019s eat! \ud83c\udf4e\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",
