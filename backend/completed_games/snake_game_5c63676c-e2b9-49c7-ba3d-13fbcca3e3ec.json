Goal:**\n- My primary goal remains to maximize my score by safely reaching apples and avoiding all hazards like walls, enemy snakes, and self-collision.\n- The target apple at **(0, 6)** is still directly above me and only one move away. Eating this apple will increase my length, so I need to be cautious as my growing body will become a factor moving forward.\n\n#### **2. Current Situation:**\n- **Position:** I am at **(0, 5)**, about to grow after eating the apple at **(0, 6)**. My body is currently nonexistent but will begin forming after this move.\n- **Path to Next Apple:** There is no obstruction or imminent danger in moving **UP** to reach the apple at **(0, 6)**.\n\n#### **3. Threats:**\n- **Walls:** There is no immediate risk of running into any walls. The apple I am targeting is safely within the bounds of the board.\n- **Enemy Snake (#0):** After eating the apple, depending on the movements of Snake #0, there might be a potential threat if I decide to move toward the apple at **(3, 4)**. However, Snake #0 is currently in the lower-left portion of the board, far from my upcoming position.\n- **Self-Collision:** After eating the apple, my body will begin to grow. I need to carefully plan my moves and avoid doubling back on myself in future turns.\n\n#### **4. Apple Prioritization After Eating:**\n- Once I eat the apple at **(0, 6)**, the next closest apple is **(2, 7)**. However, the enemy snake is positioned such that it could potentially limit my accessibility to the board's center region (depending on its movements). \n  - The **(2, 7)** apple is reasonably safe because it does not put me directly in the path of Snake #0 and provides some buffer space to maneuver.\n  - However, I will also monitor Snake #0's movements, as it may target the **(3, 4)** or **(6, 7)** apples.\n\n#### **5. Near-Term Strategy:**\n- **Immediate Move:** Move **UP** to eat the apple at **(0, 6)**.\n- **Next Move Planning:** I anticipate targeting **(2, 7)** as my next apple because it is reasonably close, does not force me into a confined corner, and provides a safe path. After eating the apple, I will re-evaluate my position and the snake's movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Move:**  \nMove **UP** to **(0, 6).**"

I successfully ate another apple and my snake has grown again.\n\nEnemy snake (ID 1) is at position (0, 5) with no body segments - it moved up one space from last turn.\n\nRemaining apples:\n- (8, 5) - 5 steps right, 1 step up\n- (6, 0) - 3 steps right, 4 steps down\n- (0, 6) - 3 steps left, 2 steps up\n- (6, 7) - 3 steps right, 3 steps up\n- (2, 7) - 1 step left, 3 steps up\n\nLet me evaluate my options:\n\nUP to (3, 5): Safe move, no obstacles. This would put me closer to the apple at (6, 7) and (2, 7).\n\nDOWN to (3, 3): This would hit my own body segment - DEATH!

It positions me well to go for the apple at (2, 7), which is one of the closer apples. From (2, 4), I could then move UP three times to reach (2, 7).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving toward the apple at (2, 7). After moving LEFT to (2, 4), I should move UP to (2, 5) to get closer to that apple, unless the enemy snake creates a threat.\n\nLEFT"

My body has now grown onto **[(0, 5)]**, and I now need to decide on my next move.\n- I gained 1 point, and my total score is updated. My snake's length is now 2 and will continue to grow as I gain more points. This impacts my future maneuvering.\n- Snake #0 is still in the lower-left quadrant of the board at **(2, 4)**, with part of its body trailing behind. It is far enough away not to pose an immediate threat. However, since Snake #0 is closest to the center apple at **(3, 4)**, it is likely to target that apple next.\n- The walls on the board edges are clear for now. I have space to move freely at the top-left region of the board.\n\n#### **2. Apple Prioritization & Movement Decision:**\n- The remaining apples are at:\n  1. **(8, 5)** \u2014 far-right center.\n  2. **(6, 0)** \u2014 bottom-center right.\n  3. **(6, 7)** \u2014 above the center-right.\n  4. **(2, 7)** \u2014 top-left-center.\n  5. **(9, 3)** \u2014 far-right bottom.\n\n- The **closest apple is at (2, 7)**. Moving toward this apple is the safest and most logical next step. It allows me to stay relatively far away from Snake #0 while not risking getting caught in a corner.\n  - Note: Once I eat this apple, my body will grow longer, so I\u2019ll need to start considering paths that avoid self-collisions. I also need an \"escape route\" to the next apple after eating this one.\n- There is no immediate threat in moving **RIGHT** toward **(2, 7)**. Since I am located at **(0, 6)**, I plan to move **RIGHT** to **(1, 6)** and then continue heading toward the apple.\n  \n#### **3. Threat Assessment:**\n- **Enemy Snake (#0):** Snake #0 could potentially head toward **(2, 7)** or the apple at **(3, 4)**. If Snake #0 decides to cut me off by heading north, I still have enough room to adjust my movement or switch directions.\n- **Body Collision:** My growing body is a low risk for now, so long as I avoid backtracking into my tail.\n- **Walls:** Minimal wall danger due to the open path toward the **(2, 7)** apple.\n\n#### **4. Near-Term Strategy:**\n1. Start moving **RIGHT** toward the **(2, 7)** apple.\n2. Carefully evaluate Snake #0\u2019s movements in the upcoming turns. If Snake #0 cuts me off, I can consider targeting apples farther away, such as **(6, 7)** or **(8, 5)**, to stay safe while maximizing points.\n3. Prioritize straights and open paths so I don\u2019t trap myself in confined spaces, especially as my body grows.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Move:**  \nMove **RIGHT** to **(1, 6).**"

Snake #0 is at **(2, 5)** and its body is still trailing further south, posing no immediate danger to my movement toward **(2, 7)**.\n- There are no walls in my vicinity, and I still have plenty of safe pathways toward my target apple at **(2, 7)**.\n\n#### **2. Apple Prioritization**\n- The **closest apple remains (2, 7)**. I am currently making progress toward it.\n  - Logical next move is **UP** to get closer to that apple. This move keeps me heading toward my goal with no risk of collision and keeps control of the space I am entering.\n  - My position after this move will be **(1, 7)**, opening up a clear path to **(2, 7)** on the next turn.\n- After eating the apple at **(2, 7)**, I\u2019ll pivot to a new apple target. Likely contenders will be:\n  1. **(6, 7):** Relatively close and safe. This depends on the positioning/direction of Snake #0 after my target apple is consumed.  \n  2. **(8, 5):** A longer but straightforward route eastward, though it brings me into Snake #0's potential path.\n\n#### **3. Enemy and Threat Assessment**\n- **Enemy Snake (#0):**\n  - Snake #0 is closest to the apple at **(3, 4)**, so I predict it may continue south and then possibly eastward rather than directly contesting me for **(2, 7)**. Its current trajectory should leave the apple at **(2, 7)** uncontested.\n  - However, it\u2019s important to monitor Snake #0\u2019s behavior to avoid getting trapped or blocked if its path deviates.\n- **Self-Collision:**\n  - Moving **UP** is safe as my tail is trailing down at **(0, 6)**, far behind where I\u2019m headed.\n- **Walls:**\n  - There are no immediate risks of running into walls. My current position is centralized, allowing ample maneuverability.\n\n#### **4. Near-Term Strategy**\n1. Move **UP** to **(1, 7)**, inching closer to **(2, 7)**.\n2. Continue monitoring Snake #0\u2019s movement. If it starts heading north and posing a threat, I may pivot toward the **(6, 7)** apple instead.\n3.

          "rationale": "### **Thought Process:**\n\n#### **1. Current Position and Status**\n- My snake's head is currently at **(1, 7)**, and the body is trailing behind at **[(1, 6)]**. I have a length of 2.\n- There is an apple very close at **(2, 7)**, just one step to the right. Moving toward this apple will both grow my body and score a point.\n- This is a safe move since:\n  - There are no walls or obstacles in the **RIGHT** direction.\n  - No enemy snakes are directly in my current path or near the target apple.\n\n#### **2. Apple Prioritization**\n- **(2, 7)** is the closest apple, and I can eat it this turn.\n- My **next priorities** after consuming this apple will likely be:\n  1. **(6, 7):** This apple is both relatively close and has a clear path.\n  2. **(8, 5):** Further away than **(6, 7)** and may require passing through Snake #0's zone. \n  3. **(6, 0):** This apple is far south and unlikely to be immediately targeted unless no other apples remain.\n  4. **(9, 3):** This is the furthest apple and can be deprioritized unless other options are unavailable.\n\n#### **3. Enemy and Threat Assessment**\n- **Snake #0:**\n  - Snake #0 starts at **(2, 6)**, with its body trailing further south at **[(2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4)]**.\n  - It\u2019s moving southward and is highly unlikely to contest **(2, 7)**, which leaves my path completely open.\n  - There is no imminent danger from Snake #0.\n\n- **Self-Collision:**\n  - Moving **RIGHT** to **(2, 7)** is perfectly safe. My body will trail further behind me at **[(1, 7), (1, 6)],** leaving ample space.\n\n- **Walls:**\n  - The walls are far from my current position. No risk here.\n\n#### **4. Move Evaluation**\n- The best move is to proceed **RIGHT** to grab the apple at **(2, 7)**. This:\n  - Adds 1 point to my score.\n  - Increases my snake\u2019s length by 1 (new body: **[(1, 7), (1, 6)]**).\n  - Keeps me in a central, safe position for targeting a new apple next turn.\n  \n- **Future Strategy:**\n  1. After eating the apple at **(2, 7)**, assess the next closest apple. Likely target will be **(6, 7)** unless Snake #0 begins moving northward threatening this path.\n  2. Avoid moving into Snake #0\u2019s region unnecessarily. Note its body at **[(2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4)]** and avoid areas near its head.\n  3. Ensure that my growing body does not box me in. I\u2019ll need to maintain open pathways as I grow.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Move:**\nMove **RIGHT** to **(2, 7).**"
