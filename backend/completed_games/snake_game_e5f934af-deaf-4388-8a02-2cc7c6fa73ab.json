This is off the board (y > 9). **FATAL**.\n2.  **DOWN**: Moves to (0, 8). Safe.\n3.  **LEFT**: Moves to (-1, 9). This is off the board (x < 0). **FATAL**.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moves to (1, 9). Safe. Note: (4, 9) is an apple, but (1, 9) is not.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Analysis of safe moves:**\n\n*   **DOWN (0, 8)**: This moves me away from the apple at (4, 9) but closer to the apples in the (x, 8) row, specifically (1, 8).\n*   **RIGHT (1, 9)**: This moves me directly along the top row towards the apple at (4, 9).\n\nThe closest apple is (4, 9), distance based on Manhattan: $4 - 0 + 9 - 9 = 4$.\nThe next closest is (1, 8), distance: $1 - 0 + 9 - 8 = 2$.\nWait, Manhattan distance calculation:\n(4, 9): $|4-0| + |9-9| = 4$.\n(1, 8): $|1-0| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe apple at (1, 8) is the closest.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (0, 8): The next turn I can move RIGHT to (1, 8) and eat the apple. This is an efficient two-turn plan.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (1, 9): I am one step further from (1, 8) (distance 2), and three steps from (4, 9) (distance 3). This is inefficient if targeting (1, 8).\n\nSnake 0 is far away at (8, 5) and poses no immediate threat.\n\nI will prioritize the closest apple, (1, 8).\n\n**Plan:**\nTurn 0: Move DOWN to (0, 8).\nTurn 1: Move RIGHT to (1, 8) and eat the apple.\n\nThis seems optimal.\n\nI will choose DOWN.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nThe closest apple is (1, 8) with a Manhattan distance of 2. Moving DOWN to (0, 8) sets me up for eating this apple on the next turn by moving RIGHT to (1, 8). This is the most efficient path to the nearest apple.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Score 0.\nApples are at: (2, 2), (5, 2), (7, 8), (4, 9), (2, 1).\n\nMy previous move (RIGHT) successfully led me to eat an apple at (1, 8).\n\n**Goal:** Find the next closest/most achievable apple and move towards it safely. The two geometrically closest visible apples are (7, 8) and (4, 9).\nManhattan distance from (1, 8):\n1. (4, 9): $|4-1| + |9-8| = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n2. (7, 8): $|7-1| + |8-8| = 6 + 0 = 6$.\n3. (2, 2): $|2-1| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7$.\n4. (5, 2): $|5-1| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10$.\n5. (2, 1): $|2-1| + |1-8| = 1 + 7 = 8$.\n\nThe apple at (4, 9) is the closest. I will aim for it.\n\n**My Movement Options from (1, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP (1, 9)**: Safe. Moves me towards (4, 9).\n2.  **DOWN (1, 7)**: Safe. Moves me away from (4, 9).\n3.  **LEFT (0, 8)**: Moves onto my body segment. **FATAL (Self-collision)**.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 8)**: Safe. Moves me towards (4, 9).\n\n**Safety Check (Self-collision):**\nI must avoid (0, 8) (my tail). Thus, LEFT is fatal. UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe concerning my body.\n\n**Safety Check (Off-board):**\nAll 4 points (1, 9), (1, 7), (0, 8), (2, 8) are on the board, but (0, 8) is a body collision.\n\n**Safety Check (Enemy #0):**\nSnake #0 is at (7, 6).\n*   If I move to (1, 9), (1, 7), or (2, 8), I am far from (7, 6).\n*   Snake 0's possible moves are (7, 7), (7, 5), (6, 6), (8, 6). None of these threaten my position immediately.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\n*   **UP (1, 9):** Decreases distance to (4, 9) by 1. Keep options open.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 8):** Decreases distance to (4, 9) by 1. Also good.\n*   **DOWN (1, 7):** Increases distance to (4, 9) by 1. Less desirable.\n\nBoth UP (1, 9) and RIGHT (2, 8) are good approaches. Moving RIGHT seems slightly more direct since I need to increase my X coordinate (1 -> 4).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 8), my next turn options include: (2, 9), (2, 7), (3, 8). (2, 9) is adjacent to the apple (4, 9).\nIf I move UP to (1, 9), my next turn options include: (0, 9), (2, 9), (1, 8) (backwards, but tail moves, so safe, though redundant). (2, 9) or (1, 10 - off board). Wait, if I move UP, I'm at (1, 9). (1, 10) is off board. I can go (0, 9), (2, 9), (1, 8). (2, 9) is still 2 steps from (4, 9).\n\nLet's prioritize increasing X coordinate since 4 > 1.\n\nI choose **RIGHT** (2, 8). This positions me below the apple and on the same Y level as the (7, 8) apple, and sets me up for a smooth route towards (4, 9).\n\n**Long-term thought (for Turn 3):**\nI will be at (2, 8), body at (1, 8). Apple (4, 9) is 3 away.\nFrom (2, 8), I should take UP (2, 9) to continue towards (4, 9) in Turn 3.\nThe primary threat remains Snake 0 moving towards (7, 8). I want to reach the north side of the board before they get into contention for (4, 9) or (7, 8).\n\nRIGHT",

UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Safety Check (Off-board):**\nAll three safe options (2, 9), (2, 7), (3, 8) are on the board (10x10).\n\n**Safety Check (Enemy #0):**\nSnake #0 is at (6, 6).\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (S0): (6, 7), (6, 5), (5, 6), (7, 6).\nNone of my safe moves (2, 9), (2, 7), (3, 8) result in a collision threat with S0. The closest S0 can get to me is 3 movement units (e.g., S0 moves to (7, 6), I move to (3, 8)).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\n*   **UP (2, 9):** Distance to (4, 9) decreases from 3 to 2.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 8):** Distance to (4, 9) decreases from 3 to 2.\n*   **DOWN (2, 7):** Distance to (4, 9) increases from 3 to 4. (Reject)\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are good.\n\nIf I move **UP (2, 9)**:\nNext turn, I am 1 move away from the apple's Y coordinate (9) and 2 moves away from its X coordinate (4). Safe options: (1, 9), (3, 9). (2, 8) is now safe because the tail has moved to (2, 8). If I move to (3, 9), I am only 1 unit away from the apple (4, 9).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT (3, 8)**:\nNext turn, I am 0 moves away from the apple's Y coordinate (8) and 1 move away from its Y coordinate (9). Safe options: (4, 8), (3, 9). If I move to (3, 9), I am 1 unit away from the apple (4, 9).\n\nBoth moves lead to a position where I can reach (4, 9) in 2 turns unless I hit it on Turn 4 (e.g., by moving to (4, 9) via (3, 9) or (4, 8) followed by (4, 9)).\n\nLet's look more closely at the position relative to (4, 9):\nThe apple is at (4, 9).\n\n1. Move UP to (2, 9). Then move RIGHT to (3, 9). Then move RIGHT to (4, 9). (3 turns total)\n2. Move RIGHT to (3, 8). Then move UP to (3, 9). Then move RIGHT to (4, 9). (3 turns total)\n3. Move RIGHT to (3, 8). Then move RIGHT to (4, 8). Then move UP to (4, 9). (3 turns total)\n4. Move UP to (2, 9). Then move RIGHT to (3, 9). I can't reach (4, 9) the next turn, must be 1 more RIGHT. (3 turns total)\n\nSince both paths take the same minimum number of steps to reach (4, 9), I'll choose the move that keeps me furthest from S0's potential path to the other high-score apple (7, 8). S0 is at (6, 6). S0 is closer to (7, 8) (distance 3) than I am (distance 5).\n\nMoving UP to (2, 9) keeps me higher on the board, maintaining my corner advantage and slightly widening the gap between me and the central area where S0 is. Moving RIGHT to (3, 8) slightly exposes me to the center. (2, 9) maintains the strong vertical approach.\n\nI prefer **UP (2, 9)**.\n\n**Long-term plan (for Turn 4):**\nI will be at (2, 9), body (2, 8). The apple (4, 9) is 2 distance units away. I should move RIGHT to (3, 9) or, if 0 moves to (4, 9) is available (which it won't be), I would take it. (3, 9) is the best choice to set up for Turn 5 apple collection.\n\nUP",

Moving DOWN to (2, 8) is a direct backward move and is typically fatal under competitive snake rules. *Self-Correction: In some rule sets, the tail moves first. Given the strict rule interpretation provided: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die,\" I must treat DOWN (2, 8) as fatal, even though (2, 8) becomes the new tail (1, 8) if I survive.* Let's assume the strictest interpretation: **FATAL (Backwards)**.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 9)**: Safe.

Moves me 1 step closer to (7, 8) in the x-direction. New distance via (5, 9): $|7-5| + |8-9| = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n\nBoth DOWN (4, 8) and RIGHT (5, 9) reduce the Manhattan distance to the target (7, 8) from 4 to 3.\n\n**Tie-breaking between DOWN and RIGHT:**\n*   **If I move DOWN to (4, 8):** I am well-positioned to continue moving RIGHT or DOWN towards (7, 8). (4, 8) is safe and opens up the large body of the board.\n*   **If I move RIGHT to (5, 9):** I stay along the top boundary. The next optimal move would be DOWN to (5, 8). Since I am in the (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9) line, remaining high up keeps me in a less congested area.\n\nLet's check the enemy Snake #0 at (9, 6).\nEnemy safe moves: UP (9, 7), DOWN (9, 5), LEFT (8, 6).\n\n*   If I move to (4, 8) and Enemy moves to (8, 6): We are safely distant (Manhattan distance 4).\n*   If I move to (5, 9) and Enemy moves to (9, 7): We are still safely distant (Manhattan distance: $|9-5| + |7-9| = 4 + 2 = 6$).\n\nBoth moves are equally good in terms of distance reduction to the apple (7, 8) and immediate safety.\n\nChoosing DOWN (4, 8): This allows for a more immediate path toward the center of the board and provides flexibility. From (4, 8), I can move RIGHT to (5, 8) or DOWN to (4, 7). Both (5, 8) and (4, 7) are closer to (7, 8).\n\nLet's confirm the path to (7, 8) through (4, 8) vs (5, 9):\nPath A (DOWN): (4, 9) -> (4, 8) [D=3] -> (5, 8) [D=2] (R) or (4, 7) [D=4] (D). (5, 8) is better.\nPath B (RIGHT): (4, 9) -> (5, 9) [D=3] -> (5, 8) [D=2]. (D).\n\nPath A: D, R, R, D or D, R, D, R etc.\nPath B: R, D, R, D or R, D, D, R etc.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4, 8) seems slightly more direct for heading into the main playing area rather than hugging the top wall.\n\n**Final Decision:** Move DOWN to (4, 8).\n\n**Long-term Plan (for Turn 7 and beyond):**\nTarget remains (7, 8).\nAfter moving to (4, 8), the next move should be RIGHT (to 5, 8) which reduces distance to 2, or DOWN (to 4, 7) which increases distance to 4. Therefore, RIGHT to (5, 8) is better. The general movement will be navigating down and right along the top half of the board before potentially moving towards the lower apples.\n\nDOWN",
