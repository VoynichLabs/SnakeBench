The only immediate danger is moving off the board or into the enemy's head (which is at (8,2)).\n\nPossible moves from (8,8):\n1. **UP**: (8,9) - Valid (within board).\n2. **DOWN**: (8,7) - Valid.\n3. **LEFT**: (7,8) - Valid.\n4. **RIGHT**: (9,8) - Valid.\n\nNo immediate collisions with the enemy's head (which is at (8,2)), so all moves are safe in terms of not hitting the enemy or yourself.\n\n### Apple Proximity and Strategy\nThe closest apples to your head (8,8) are:\n- (5,9): Distance = sqrt((8-5)^2 + (9-9)^2) = 3 (right and up).\n- (1,9): Distance = sqrt((8-1)^2 + (9-9)^2) = 7 (left and up).\n- (9,2): Distance = sqrt((8-9)^2 + (8-2)^2) = sqrt(1 + 36) = ~6.08 (left and down).\n- (4,1): Distance = sqrt((8-4)^2 + (8-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 49) = ~7.81 (left and down).\n- (1,2): Distance = sqrt((8-1)^2 + (8-2)^2) = sqrt(49 + 36) = ~8.54 (left and down).\n\nThe closest apple is at (5,9), which is 3 units to the right and up. This is the most promising target for the first move.\n\n### Enemy Movement Considerations\nThe enemy is at (8,2). Its possible moves are:\n- UP: (8,3)\n- DOWN: (8,1) - Off the board (invalid).\n- LEFT: (7,2)\n- RIGHT: (9,2)\n\nThe enemy could move to (8,3), (7,2), or (9,2). None of these directly threaten your head at (8,8) unless it moves into a position where it can block your path later. For now, no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Optimal First Move\nSince this is the first move, the goal is to position yourself to reach the closest apple (5,9) efficiently. Moving **UP** to (8,9) is a good start because:\n- It moves you closer to the apple at (5,9) (now only 3 units right).\n- It doesn't block any potential future paths.\n- It keeps you away from the enemy's current position.\n\nOther options:\n- **DOWN** to (8,7): Moves you away from the apple at (5,9).\n- **LEFT** to (7,8): Moves you away from the apple at (5,9).\n- **RIGHT** to (9,8): Moves you closer to the apple at (9,2), but this is farther away than (5,9).\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Self Note)\n1. First move: **UP** to (8,9) to start moving toward (5,9).\n2. Next moves: Continue moving right and up to reach (5,9). Avoid getting trapped by the enemy.\n3. If the enemy starts moving toward the same apple, adjust path to avoid collision.\n4. Keep an eye on other apples for backup plans if the primary path is blocked.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe best first move is **UP**.\n\nUP",

No immediate threat to me, but monitor their path.\n3. **Safety**: Avoid moving into my own body (none yet) or enemy bodies. No risk of collision with enemy #1 on this turn.\n\n**Next 3 Moves Strategy:**\n- **Turn 3**: Move **LEFT** to (6,9) to get closer to (5,9).\n- **Turn 4**: Move **LEFT** to (5,9) to eat the apple. Grow to length 2, gain 1 point.\n- **Turn 5**: After eating, assess new apple positions and enemy movements. Likely candidates: (1,9) or (9,0). Prioritize (1,9) if enemy doesn\u2019t block.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- If enemy #1 starts moving toward (5,9) or (1,9), adjust path to avoid overlap. Their current position suggests they\u2019re unlikely to interfere with my path to (5,9) soon.\n- Watch for other snakes (none visible yet) or apples appearing near my path.\n\n**Long-Term:**\n- After securing (5,9), plan a path to (1,9) or (4,1) while avoiding enemy snakes.

Next closest is (1,9) (distance 5 left). Focus on (5,9) first.\n2. **Enemy Tracking**: Enemy #1 is at (9,2) with body at (8,2). Their only safe move is UP to (9,3). No immediate threat to me, but monitor their path.\n3. **Safety**: Avoid moving into my own body (none yet) or enemy bodies. No risk of collision with enemy #1 on this turn.\n\n**Next 3 Moves Strategy:**\n- **Turn 3**: Move **LEFT** to (5,9) to eat the apple. Grow to length 2, gain 1 point.\n- **Turn 4**: After eating, assess new apple positions and enemy movements. Likely candidates: (1,9) or (4,1). Prioritize (1,9) if enemy doesn\u2019t block.\n- **Turn 5**: Plan a path to (1,9) while avoiding enemy snakes. If enemy #1 starts moving toward (1,9), adjust path to avoid overlap.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- If enemy #1 starts moving toward (5,9) or (1,9), adjust path to avoid overlap. Their current position suggests they\u2019re unlikely to interfere with my path to (5,9) soon.\n- Watch for other snakes or apples appearing near my path.\n\n**Long-Term:**\n- After securing (5,9), plan a path to (1,9) or (4,1) while avoiding enemy snakes.

This keeps me away from the enemy's likely path to (1,2).\n- **Turn 13**: Plan a path to (1,2) while avoiding enemy snakes. If enemy #1 starts moving toward (1,2), adjust path to avoid overlap.\n- **Turn 14**: If enemy #1 grows, their movement will become more constrained, giving me opportunities to corner them. Focus on securing more apples while keeping a safe distance.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- If enemy #1 starts moving toward (1,2), adjust path to avoid overlap. Their current position suggests they\u2019re unlikely to interfere with my path to (1,2) soon.\n- Watch for other snakes or apples appearing near my path.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 12):\n\n**Board Layout:**\n- Apples: (1,2), (4,1), (8,4), (0,2).\n- My snake: Head at (1,5), body [(1,6), (1,7)] (length 3).\n- Enemy #1: Head at (5,3), body [(9,1), (9,2), (5,3)].\n\n**Possible Moves from (1,5):**\n1. **UP**: (1,6) \u2192 Collides with my body (1,6) \u2192 **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: (1,4) \u2192 Valid.\n3. **LEFT**: (0,5) \u2192 Valid.\n4. **RIGHT**: (2,5) \u2192 Valid.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n- No collision with my own body (only (1,6) and (1,7) are occupied).\n- Enemy #1\u2019s body is at (9,1), (9,2), (5,3). No overlap with (1,5).\n- No immediate collision risk.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- The closest apple to (1,5) is (1,2) (distance 3 diagonal). Moving **LEFT** to (0,5) is a safe repositioning move that allows me to move towards (0,2) or (1,2) in the next turn.\n- The apple at (0,2) is also close (distance 2 diagonal), and moving LEFT to (0,5) is a good step towards it.\n\n**Enemy Movement:**\n- Enemy #1\u2019s head is at (5,3). Their possible moves are:\n  - UP to (5,4)\n  - DOWN to (5,2)\n  - LEFT to (4,3)\n  - RIGHT to (6,3)\n\n**Optimal Move:**\n- **LEFT** to (0,5) is a safe move:\n  - Avoids immediate collision with my own body.\n  - Keeps me away from enemy #1\u2019s potential path.\n  - Allows me to reposition closer to the apple at (0,2) or (1,2).\n\n- **DOWN** to (1,4) is safe but doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples quickly.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (2,5) is safe but doesn\u2019t help in reaching any apples quickly.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\nLEFT",
