No move causes an immediate loss.\n\nShort plan:\n- Continue UP to reach y=5 and take the apple at (4,5).\n- After getting (4,5), pivot to (5,5) then contest the eastern cluster if safe, while avoiding close head-on confrontations.\n- Keep moves that preserve escape options (avoid hugging walls unnecessarily).\n\nUP",
