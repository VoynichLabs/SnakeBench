This also moves away from (8,\u202f8) and limits future options.  \n- **RIGHT** moves to (7,\u202f8). This cell is empty, not part of any snake\u2019s body, and brings the head one step closer to the apple at (8,\u202f8) (distance drops from 2 to 1). From (7,\u202f8) the next turn still leaves three viable directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) and keeps us clear of the enemy head at (8,\u202f6).  \n\nTherefore the safest move that both progresses toward an apple and preserves multiple future options is **RIGHT**.  \n\nPlan: Continue moving rightward toward the (8,\u202f8) apple while monitoring enemy positions; keep options open by staying away from the left edge and avoiding back\u2011tracking into our own body.  \nRIGHT",
