DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are all safe.\n\nLEFT to (5, 1) is the optimal move - it immediately collects an apple, grows my snake, and gains me a point. This brings me from 3 apples to 4 apples, closing the gap with snake #1 (7 apples).\n\nThis is a clear choice: LEFT gives me an immediate apple, while the other safe moves just reposition without scoring.\n\nLEFT",

This would be disastrous since I'm behind 6-7 in apples.\n\nLet me analyze the enemy's likely moves:\n- The enemy probably wants the apple at (3, 3) too\n- From (2, 3), RIGHT to (3, 3) gets them the apple\n- They might also consider other directions, but the apple is very tempting\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nWhile moving LEFT gets me the apple, the risk of head-on collision is too high. I should play it safe and avoid moving into (3, 3) this turn.\n\nBetween UP to (4, 4) and RIGHT to (5, 3):\n- UP moves me away from the immediate conflict zone\n- RIGHT keeps me in the general area but avoids the collision risk\n\nI'll go with RIGHT to stay alive and maintain flexibility. This keeps me safe and positions me to potentially get apples at (5, 7), (6, 6), or (7, 8) in future turns.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (5, 3), I should continue toward the cluster of apples in the upper-right area. I'll let the enemy take the (3, 3) apple rather than risk a fatal collision. With a longer snake and more strategic positioning, I can target the multiple apples at (6, 6), (7, 8), and (5, 7).\n\nRIGHT",

I have only one safe move: DOWN to (9, 8).

I need to maintain mobility and avoid getting stuck in corners or against my own body. Working my way down the right side or moving leftward through the top/middle of the board might be good strategies.\n\nDOWN",

Moving RIGHT corners me against the wall and reduces options; moving LEFT brings me closer to the enemy\u2019s blocked corridor near x=6. UP keeps the most flexibility and advances toward the top-right apple if it\u2019s contestable.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue north/right as long as space remains to contest (9,7). If opponent commits to that apple and boxes me, fall back to circle the right side and then target lower apples like (6,2) or the cluster at x=1.\n- Avoid entering the x=6 corridor where opponent body blocks escape routes; prefer routes with at least 2\u20133 follow-up moves.\n\nUP",

From (9, 6), I'd have limited options.\n\nLEFT is the better strategic move - it gets me away from the edge and into more open space where I'll have better mobility and can plan a route toward the apples on the left side of the board.\n\n**Future strategy:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (8, 7), I should continue working my way leftward toward the cluster of apples at (6, 2) and (3, 2), but carefully to avoid getting trapped again.\n\nLEFT",

No other snake bodies occupy (2,2).\n- Eating the apple at (2,2) now allows an immediate follow-up to (3,2) for another apple, rapidly closing the gap on Snake #0 (they have 13 vs my 11).\n- Moving RIGHT keeps multiple escape options (after taking apples I can retreat down or left if an opponent appears, and my long body along the top-right doesn\u2019t block access to the apple corridor).\n- Avoiding LEFT/DOWN delays the apple chain and gives the opponent time to collect or reposition.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Take (2,2) this turn, then take (3,2) next turn. After securing that cluster, reassess: either continue to (6,2) if safe, or start a safe route toward open board space to avoid being cornered by Snake #0.\n\nRIGHT",

Limited future options and moves away from the enemy who is at (1, 2).\n- RIGHT (1, 7): Moves me toward the center, gives me more space, and positions me above the enemy. From (1, 7) I could then go DOWN to (1, 6) or continue RIGHT.\n\n**Critical danger assessment:**\nThe enemy snake is right next to me at (1, 2). If I go RIGHT to (1, 7), I need to consider what the enemy might do. The enemy's safe moves from (1, 2) are:\n- UP to (1, 3) - their own body\n- DOWN to (1, 1) - safe\n- LEFT to (0, 2) - safe\n- RIGHT to (2, 2) - has an apple\n\nThe enemy will likely go RIGHT to (2, 2) to eat the apple there, or possibly DOWN/LEFT. This means RIGHT to (1, 7) is safe - the enemy won't collide with me.\n\n**Apple accessibility:**\nGoing RIGHT positions me better to reach the apples at (3, 2), (6, 2), and (7, 0). DOWN would also work but keeps me pinned to the left edge.\n\nRIGHT is the better choice. It gives me more mobility and moves me toward the center where I have better access to multiple apples.\n\n**Strategic note for future turns:** I've successfully descended to (0, 7). Now I should move toward the center to access the apples at y=2 level. The enemy is at (1, 2) and will likely eat the apple at (2, 2) or (3, 2) soon. I should try to reach (6, 2) or (7, 0) which are further from the enemy. After going RIGHT to (1, 7), my next move should be DOWN to (1, 6) to continue toward the apple cluster, unless the enemy poses an immediate threat.\n\nRIGHT",
