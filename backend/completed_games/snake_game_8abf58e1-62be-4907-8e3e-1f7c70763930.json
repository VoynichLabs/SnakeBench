Prefer a move that keeps options open and moves toward reachable apples while increasing separation from the opponent.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Head RIGHT now to approach (6,5). From there, favor paths that keep me in open space (avoid getting boxed near the enemy) and pick apples at (6,5) or (8,4)/(7,5). Stay aware of enemy movements and avoid shrinking my available space or moving directly toward the enemy head.\n\nRIGHT",

        "1": {
          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "First, I need to evaluate my current situation. I'm snake #1 with a length of 1 (only my head at (2, 5)). The enemy snake #0 is at (4, 4) with length 1. There are many apples on the board. I need to avoid the enemy and collect apples. Since the game is turn-based and both snakes move simultaneously, I must predict the enemy's likely move. The enemy is at (4, 4), which is to my right and down a bit. I'm at (2, 5).\n\nLet's list my possible moves and check for immediate death.\n\nMy head: (2, 5).\n\nPotential moves:\n- UP: (2, 6)\n- DOWN: (2, 4)\n- LEFT: (1, 5)\n- RIGHT: (3, 5)\n\nCheck each:\n\n1. UP to (2, 6): Is this on the board? Yes, y=6 within 0-9. Is it occupied by any snake body? My body is empty. Enemy body is empty. So no collision. Also, not moving backwards because I have no body. So UP seems safe.\n\n2. DOWN to (2, 4): On board, no body collision. Safe.\n\n3. LEFT to (1, 5): On board, no body collision. Safe.\n\n4. RIGHT to (3, 5): On board, no body collision. However, note that the enemy is at (4, 4). If I move RIGHT, I go to (3, 5). The enemy might move. Could the enemy move to (3, 5) or cause a head-on collision? If the enemy moves UP to (4, 5) or RIGHT to (5, 4) etc., but if the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 4), that's not (3, 5). The only way for the enemy to land on (3, 5) is if they move LEFT and UP? Actually from (4, 4), moving UP goes to (4, 5), moving LEFT goes to (3, 4), moving RIGHT goes to (5, 4), moving DOWN goes to (4, 3). So (3, 5) is not reachable in one move from (4, 4). So no head-on collision risk. However, consider if the enemy moves into my body? My body is currently empty, so no. So RIGHT is also safe from immediate death.\n\nAll four moves seem immediately safe in terms of not dying this turn. But we must consider future safety and apple opportunities.\n\nNow, I need to think about the apples. The apples are listed: (9,6), (7,5), (7,1), (8,4), (1,7), (0,7), (9,9), (0,9), (6,0), (0,2), (9,1), (6,5), (3,7), (3,6), (7,6). That's 15 apples.\n\nI should try to collect apples while avoiding the enemy. The enemy is at (4,4). I am at (2,5). The nearest apples? Let's compute distances from (2,5):\n\n- (1,7): dx=1, dy=2, Manhattan distance=3\n- (0,7): dx=2, dy=2, distance=4\n- (3,7): dx=1, dy=2, distance=3\n- (3,6): dx=1, dy=1, distance=2\n- (6,5): dx=4, dy=0, distance=4\n- (7,5): dx=5, dy=0, distance=5\n- (3,7) already considered.\n- (0,2): dx=2, dy=-3, distance=5\n- (6,0): dx=4, dy=-5, distance=9\n- (7,1): dx=5, dy=-4, distance=9\n- (8,4): dx=6, dy=-1, distance=7\n- (9,1): dx=7, dy=-4, distance=11\n- (9,6): dx=7, dy=1, distance=8\n- (9,9): dx=7, dy=4, distance=11\n- (0,9): dx=2, dy=4, distance=6\n\nSo the closest apples are (3,6) distance 2, then (1,7) and (3,7) distance 3. (3,6) is at x=3, y=6. That's one step up from my current position? My current (2,5): to reach (3,6), I could go RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT. So I could get there in two moves if I go RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT. But note that the enemy is nearby.\n\nThe enemy at (4,4) might also target apples. Let's see apples near the enemy: (4,4) itself has no apple. Nearby: (3,6) distance 3, (6,5) distance 3, (7,5) distance 4, (4,4) is between them. Actually, (3,6) is relatively close to both of us. (3,6) is also an apple. I should consider whether the enemy might go for (3,6). From (4,4), to get to (3,6) in one move is impossible because Manhattan distance is |3-4|+|6-4|=1+2=3. So the enemy cannot reach (3,6) in one turn. In two turns, the enemy could potentially go for it. But I could get there in two turns if I move appropriately.\n\nBut also, I need to consider the board geometry and potential traps. Since I'm small (length 1), I have mobility. However, the board has many obstacles? Actually, the only obstacles are snakes and walls. But we must avoid running into our own body as we grow. Since we're length 1, we don't have a body yet, so no self-collision issue for now. However, after eating an apple, we will grow by 1 segment. That means our tail will stay where it was, and we will have a body. That could become a trap later if we're not careful.\n\nSo strategy: Try to collect apples safely, avoid the enemy, and not get trapped.\n\nNow, let's consider each move option and think about future moves.\n\nOption 1: UP to (2,6). This moves me closer to (3,6) and (3,7) and (1,7). From (2,6), I could go RIGHT to (3,6) to eat the apple. That would be a good move. But also, from (2,6), I could go LEFT to (1,6) which is not an apple, but might be safe. However, we must consider the enemy's potential move. The enemy might move towards apples. Where might the enemy go? The enemy is at (4,4). Some apples near: (3,6), (6,5), (7,5). The enemy could go UP to (4,5) to get closer to (3,6) or (6,5). Or RIGHT to (5,4) to go towards (6,5) or (7,5). Or LEFT to (3,4) to go towards (3,6). Or DOWN to (4,3) which seems less fruitful. The enemy might also go for apples not in my immediate vicinity. Since the enemy has no body, it's also safe to move anywhere.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,6), then on the next turn, I could go RIGHT to (3,6) to eat the apple. But I must consider if the enemy could get to (3,6) before me. The enemy would need two moves to reach (3,6) from (4,4). For example: move UP to (4,5) then LEFT to (3,5) then? Actually (3,6) is not reachable in two moves? From (4,4) to (3,6): first move could be UP to (4,5), second move could be LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) or RIGHT to (5,5) etc. To reach (3,6), after two moves, the enemy could be at (3,5) or (4,6). Not (3,6). So in two moves, the enemy cannot get to (3,6). In three moves, yes. So if I go UP now, then RIGHT next turn, I'll eat the apple on my second move (turn 2). That seems safe from enemy competition.\n\nBut there is also an apple at (3,7) which is also close. From (2,6), I could go UP to (2,7) then RIGHT to (3,7). But that's two moves as well. However, (3,6) is closer in Manhattan distance from my current position if I go RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT. Both are two moves.\n\nOption 2: RIGHT to (3,5). This puts me at (3,5). From there, I could go UP to (3,6) to eat the apple in one move. That seems even better: if I go RIGHT now, then next turn I can go UP and eat (3,6). However, we must consider if that is safe. From (3,5) after moving RIGHT, the enemy might move and potentially cause a head-on collision or trap me. The enemy at (4,4) could move LEFT to (3,4) which is not (3,5). Or UP to (4,5), etc. So no immediate head-on collision. However, after I move to (3,5), on the next turn, if I go UP to (3,6), the enemy could also move. Could the enemy go to (3,6) in the same turn? From (4,4), as discussed, cannot reach (3,6) in one move. So no collision. But what about the turn after? If the enemy moves towards (3,6), it might get there on the same turn as I do if I delay? But if I go RIGHT now and UP next turn, I'll eat on turn 2. The enemy would need at least 3 moves to get to (3,6). So I would secure the apple.\n\nBut there is a risk: after I eat the apple, my body will grow. At the moment I eat (3,6), my tail will remain at my previous position. If I go from (3,5) to (3,6), my tail was at (2,5) (since I moved from (2,5) to (3,5) on turn 1). So after eating on turn 2, my body will be: head (3,6), body (3,5), tail (2,5). That might be a bit crowded. But since the board is open, it might be okay.\n\nOption 3: LEFT to (1,5). This moves me away from the nearest apples (3,6) and towards (1,7). (1,7) is an apple. From (1,5), I could go UP to (1,6) then UP to (1,7) to eat. That's two moves. But there is also (0,7) nearby. However, the enemy might be less interested in that side. But the apple at (3,6) is closer and seems more accessible. Also, moving LEFT might lead me towards the left edge where there are apples: (0,2), (0,7), (0,9). But (0,2) is far down. However, moving left might be safe, but I'm moving away from the central cluster of apples.\n\nOption 4: DOWN to (2,4). This moves me down. There is an apple at (3,7) but that's up. Downwards, there is (6,0) far away, (0,2) somewhat closer. But from (2,4), to reach (0,2) I need to go LEFT twice and DOWN twice. That's 4 moves. Not as efficient as going for (3,6). Also, moving down might bring me closer to the enemy? The enemy is at (4,4), so (2,4) is two cells left. The enemy could move LEFT to (3,4) which is adjacent to (2,4). That could be risky if the enemy then moves into my path. But not immediately.\n\nConsidering all, I think moving RIGHT to (3,5) is the best because it sets up to eat the apple (3,6) next turn. Also, (3,5) is a good position: it's central, and from there I have multiple options: up to (3,6) for apple, left to (2,5) (but that's my previous spot, which will be my tail after I move, so moving left would be into my own tail? Actually after moving to (3,5), my tail will be at (2,5) if I don't eat an apple. But if I don't eat, moving left to (2,5) would be moving into my own body (since my tail is there) and that would kill me. So I must avoid moving back into my tail. So after moving RIGHT, I should not move LEFT on the next turn. That's fine because I plan to go UP.\n\nBut wait, the rules: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Since my body is only one segment (the tail), and the tail is directly behind my head if I move straight and then reverse? Actually, after moving RIGHT, my head is at (3,5), my tail is at (2,5). The direction from head to tail is left. So if I move LEFT, I would be moving into my own tail, which is directly behind the head. That is forbidden and would cause death. So indeed, after moving RIGHT, I cannot move LEFT. That's okay as long as I have other safe moves.\n\nNow, consider the enemy's potential move. The enemy might also be targeting apples. Which apples are near the enemy? (3,6), (6,5), (7,5), (4,4) itself has no apple. The enemy might move towards (6,5) or (3,6). If the enemy moves UP to (4,5) or LEFT to (3,4), those are safe. But if the enemy moves UP, it gets closer to (3,6). However, as argued, the enemy cannot reach (3,6) before me if I go RIGHT then UP.\n\nBut there is also an apple at (6,5) which is four steps away from the enemy. The enemy might go for that. That's fine; it's away from me.\n\nAnother consideration: board boundaries. I'm at (2,5). If I go RIGHT to (3,5), I'm still central. If I go UP to (2,6), I'm also central. Both seem fine.\n\nBut there is a subtlety: after I eat an apple, I grow. That might affect my movement options later. But since I'm currently length 1, I have flexibility.\n\nNow, I should also consider the possibility of the enemy moving into my path. For example, if I go RIGHT to (3,5), and the enemy goes LEFT to (3,4), that's fine. If the enemy goes UP to (4,5), that's fine. But what if the enemy goes RIGHT to (5,4)? That's away. So no collision.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,6), the enemy might go LEFT to (3,4) or UP to (4,5). Again, no collision.\n\nBut there is also the possibility of the enemy moving to a cell that I might move into on the next turn. Since we move simultaneously, we don't know the enemy's move until after we both move. So I need to anticipate the enemy's likely move. The enemy is rational and will try to survive and collect apples. Which move is best for the enemy? The enemy might see apples like (3,6) and (6,5). (3,6) is closer in terms of steps? Actually from (4,4) to (3,6) is 3 steps, to (6,5) is 3 steps as well. Both are equidistant. But (3,6) is also an apple that I am targeting. The enemy might want to compete. However, since the enemy is at (4,4), moving LEFT to (3,4) would be a step towards (3,6). Moving UP to (4,5) would also be towards (3,6) (since from (4,5) to (3,6) is one step left and one step up? Actually Manhattan distance from (4,5) to (3,6) is 2). So both are plausible.\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (3,4), that is adjacent to my potential position (3,5). That's okay, but on the next turn, if I go UP to (3,6) and the enemy goes UP to (3,5) or something? Let's simulate: Suppose I move RIGHT to (3,5). Enemy moves LEFT to (3,4). Then on turn 2, I plan to go UP to (3,6). The enemy might go UP to (3,5) or UP to (3,5) from (3,4) would be moving into (3,5), which is my head position at that moment? But we move simultaneously, so on turn 2, if I go UP from (3,5) to (3,6), and the enemy goes UP from (3,4) to (3,5), we would not collide because I am leaving (3,5) and the enemy is entering (3,5) at the same time. Is that allowed? The rules: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" In this case, my head moves from (3,5) to (3,6), and enemy head moves from (3,4) to (3,5). They are moving into different cells. No collision. However, if the enemy moves into my body? At the start of turn 2, my body is: head (3,5), tail (2,5). The enemy moving to (3,5) would be moving into my head, but since my head is also moving away, does that count? Actually, the collision check is based on the destination cells after movement. My head ends at (3,6), enemy head ends at (3,5). So no head-on collision. But also, the enemy head moving into my body? My body includes (3,5) at the start of the turn, but (3,5) is my head, not body? Actually, at the start of turn 2, my body consists of my head (3,5) and my tail (2,5). The rules say: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" And \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\" So if the enemy head moves into (3,5), which is my head? Actually, my head is at (3,5). That is part of my body? The snake's body includes the head. Typically, the head is part of the body. So if the enemy head moves into (3,5), that would be moving into my body (since my head occupies (3,5) at the start of the turn). However, the rules might consider that the head is part of the body. So the enemy would die if it moves into my head. But simultaneously, my head is moving away. The rule: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies.\" This likely includes your head. So if the enemy moves into (3,5) while my head is there, the enemy dies. That could be good for me. But we need to be careful: if the enemy moves into my head, they die, and I survive (since my head moves out). However, there is also a possibility of head-on collision if both heads move into the same cell. That's not the case here.\n\nSo if the enemy moves into my current head position while I am moving away, the enemy dies. That could be a strategy, but it's risky because if the enemy doesn't move there, I might be putting myself in danger.\n\nBut in this scenario, if I go RIGHT to (3,5), and the enemy goes LEFT to (3,4), then on turn 2, if I go UP to (3,6), and the enemy goes UP to (3,5), the enemy would die because it moves into my head (since my head is still at (3,5) at the start of turn 2). That would eliminate the enemy, which is great for me. However, is that likely? The enemy might not choose that move if it sees that (3,5) is occupied by my head. The enemy will consider its own safety. From (3,4), moving UP to (3,5) would be moving into my head, which would cause the enemy to die. The enemy would avoid that if possible. So the enemy would likely choose another move, such as going RIGHT to (4,4) or DOWN to (3,3) or UP to (3,5) if it doesn't see the danger? But the enemy knows the board state? The problem says we are controlling one snake, but the enemy is also playing. The enemy's decision is not under our control; we must assume the enemy will play optimally to win. So the enemy will avoid moving into our body if it leads to death. So the enemy would not move into (3,5) if it knows my head is there. Therefore, the scenario of the enemy dying by moving into my head is unlikely if the enemy is rational.\n\nThus, we should not rely on that. We should focus on safe apple collection.\n\nAnother consideration: If I go RIGHT to (3,5), and the enemy goes UP to (4,5), then on turn 2, I go UP to (3,6) and eat the apple. The enemy might go LEFT to (3,5) from (4,5)? That would be moving into (3,5) which is my tail? Actually after I eat, my body will be: head (3,6), body (3,5), tail (2,5). So (3,5) is my body. If the enemy moves into (3,5), they would die. That could be another way to eliminate the enemy, but again, the enemy would likely avoid that.\n\nSo overall, moving RIGHT seems good.\n\nWhat about moving UP? If I go UP to (2,6), then I can go RIGHT to (3,6) next turn to eat the apple. That also works. But from (2,6), I have to go RIGHT, which is towards (3,6). That's similar. However, from (2,6), moving RIGHT to (3,6) would eat the apple. But note: from (2,6), if I go RIGHT, I go to (3,6). That's one move away. Actually, from (2,6) to (3,6) is one step right, so I could eat on turn 2 as well. So both paths lead to eating (3,6) on turn 2.\n\nWhich path is safer? Let's compare the intermediate positions.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5): intermediate position (3,5). This is closer to the enemy? The enemy is at (4,4). (3,5) is adjacent diagonally? Actually, (3,5) is adjacent to (4,4) (difference of (1,1)). So it's close. The enemy could move to (3,5) in one move? From (4,4) to (3,5) is moving LEFT and UP? But moves are only one step in cardinal directions. So the enemy cannot move to (3,5) in one move because it would require both left and up. So the enemy cannot land on (3,5) in one turn. That's safe.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,6): intermediate position (2,6). This is farther from the enemy: distance from (4,4) to (2,6) is |2-4|+|6-4|=2+2=4. So safer from enemy.\n\nBut also, from (2,6), I am one step closer to the left side apples, but that's not a priority.\n\nAnother apple: (3,7) is also close. From (3,6) after eating, I could go UP to (3,7) to eat another apple. That's possible. But from (2,6) as intermediate, I could also go UP to (2,7) then RIGHT to (3,7). That takes two moves after.\n\nConsidering all, I think moving RIGHT is slightly more aggressive but efficient. However, moving UP might be safer because it keeps distance from the enemy. But the enemy might also move UP towards (4,5) etc. Actually, if I go UP to (2,6), the enemy might move LEFT to (3,4) or UP to (4,5). Neither is particularly threatening.\n\nI should also consider the board edges. My current position (2,5) is not near edges. Moving UP or RIGHT keeps me away from edges.\n\nAnother factor: after eating the apple, my tail will be at (2,5) if I go RIGHT then UP? Let's simulate:\n\nOption RIGHT then UP:\nTurn 1: Move RIGHT from (2,5) to (3,5). No apple. Body: tail at (2,5).\nTurn 2: Move UP from (3,5) to (3,6). Eat apple. Grow: new segment added at the tail's old position? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow by 1 segment, meaning your body length increases by 1. The tail does not move that turn. So after eating, my body will be: head (3,6), body (3,5), tail (2,5). So length 3.\n\nOption UP then RIGHT:\nTurn 1: Move UP to (2,6). Body: tail (2,5).\nTurn 2: Move RIGHT to (3,6). Eat apple. Body: head (3,6), body (2,6), tail (2,5). Length 3.\n\nIn both cases, the tail ends at (2,5). The difference is the body segment position: in first case, body is at (3,5); in second case, body is at (2,6). Which is better? (3,5) is more central, (2,6) is more towards the left-top. (2,6) might be less obstructive for future moves.\n\nAlso, consider that after eating, I have a body. I need to avoid moving into my own body. From (3,6) with body at (3,5) and tail (2,5), if I go UP to (3,7), that's fine. If I go LEFT to (2,6), that's free (since body is at (3,5) and tail (2,5)). Actually, (2,6) is empty, so that's okay. If I go DOWN to (3,5), that would be into my body (the segment at (3,5)), so that would kill me. So I must avoid going DOWN from (3,6). Similarly, from (2,6) with body at (2,5) and tail (2,5)? Wait, tail is at (2,5) and body is at (2,6)? Actually after eating at (3,6) via UP then RIGHT, my head is (3,6), body is (2,6), tail is (2,5). So from (3,6), moving LEFT to (2,6) would be into my body (segment at (2,6)), so that would kill me. So in both cases, I have to be careful not to move back into my body. But that's manageable.\n\nNow, considering the enemy's potential growth. The enemy might also collect apples. Which apples are accessible to the enemy? The enemy could go for (3,6) as well, but as we argued, I can get there first if I move optimally. However, if I delay, the enemy might get it. So I should try to secure (3,6) quickly.\n\nAlso, note that there are apples at (3,7) and (1,7) and (0,7). These are in the upper-left area. I could potentially collect a chain of apples after eating (3,6). For example, after eating (3,6), I could go to (3,7) then (2,7) or (1,7) etc. That could be a good plan.\n\nBut also, there is an apple at (6,5) which is to the right. The enemy might go for that. That's fine; it's away from me.\n\nNow, what about the other apples? There are apples at (0,2), (6,0), (7,1), (8,4), (9,1), (9,6), (9,9), (0,9). These are scattered.\n\nGiven the board is 10x10, there is plenty of space.\n\nI should also consider the rule that the game lasts 150 turns, so long-term survival is important. I should avoid getting trapped. Since I'm moving towards the upper-left corner, I might eventually get trapped against the wall if I'm not careful. But currently, I have many options.\n\nLet's evaluate the safety of each move in terms of future mobility.\n\n- Move RIGHT to (3,5): This moves me towards the center-right. From there, I have access to the right side apples like (6,5) and (7,5) etc. But also, I can go up to (3,6) and then to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (0,7). So it's flexible.\n\n- Move UP to (2,6): This moves me towards the top-left. From there, I can go to (2,7), (1,7), (0,7), (3,6) etc. Also, I can go right to (3,6) or up to (2,7). That's also flexible.\n\n- Move LEFT to (1,5): This moves me towards the left edge. From there, I can go up to (1,6), (1,7) or left to (0,5), etc. But (0,5) is not an apple. The apples on left are (0,2), (0,7), (0,9). So (0,7) is accessible. However, going left might limit my options to the right side apples. But the right side has many apples too. It might be better to stay central.\n\n- Move DOWN to (2,4): This moves me down. Downwards, there are fewer apples. The nearest apple down is (0,2) or (6,0) far away. So this seems less fruitful.\n\nThus, LEFT and DOWN are less attractive.\n\nBetween RIGHT and UP, which is better? Let's consider the enemy's likely moves. The enemy is at (4,4). If I go RIGHT to (3,5), I'm getting closer to the enemy. If I go UP to (2,6), I'm moving away. From a safety perspective, moving away from the enemy might be better because I reduce the risk of future head-on collisions. However, the enemy might also move away or towards me. Since the enemy is rational, it might also try to avoid me. But if I move towards the enemy, there's a higher chance of interaction later.\n\nBut also, by moving towards the enemy, I might be able to cut off the enemy from some apples. However, at this stage, it's early, and the enemy might not be interested in the same apples.\n\nLet's look at the apple distribution: (3,6) is the closest to both of us. It's a contested apple. If I go for it, I should secure it. If I go UP, I can still get to (3,6) in one more move. If I go RIGHT, I can get to (3,6) in one more move. Both achieve that. But which gives me a better position after securing the apple? After securing (3,6), I will have a body. The position after eating might affect my ability to collect further apples.\n\nIf I go RIGHT then UP: after eating, I'm at (3,6) with body at (3,5) and tail at (2,5). From (3,6), I can go UP to (3,7) (apple), LEFT to (2,6) (empty), or RIGHT to (4,6) (empty). I cannot go DOWN (into body). So I have three options. Good.\n\nIf I go UP then RIGHT: after eating, I'm at (3,6) with body at (2,6) and tail at (2,5). From (3,6), I can go UP to (3,7), RIGHT to (4,6), or DOWN to (3,5) (empty? Actually (3,5) is empty in this scenario because my body is at (2,6) and tail at (2,5). So (3,5) is empty. So I can go DOWN as well. But going LEFT to (2,6) would be into my body, so that's not allowed. So I have three options: UP, RIGHT, DOWN. That's also three options.\n\nBoth give similar flexibility.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (3,7). From (3,6), I can go UP to get it. That's one move away. So after eating (3,6), I could immediately go for (3,7) next turn. That would be a quick double apple. However, I need to consider that after eating (3,6), my tail will be at (2,5). If I go UP to (3,7), my body will grow by one segment (since I ate an apple, I already grew, but I haven't moved yet? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow immediately that turn. So after turn 2, I have length 3. On turn 3, if I move UP to (3,7) and there is an apple, I will eat another apple and grow again. So I could chain apples.\n\nBut is (3,7) safe? The enemy might also go for (3,7). From (4,4), to reach (3,7) in two moves? Let's see: from (4,4) to (3,7): Manhattan distance 1+3=4. So enemy would need at least 4 moves to get there. So likely safe.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (1,7) and (0,7). I could potentially collect those later.\n\nNow, what about the enemy's potential move this turn? The enemy might move towards (3,6) or (6,5). If the enemy moves LEFT to (3,4), that's closer to me if I go RIGHT. If I go UP, the enemy moving LEFT to (3,4) is still away. But if I go RIGHT, and the enemy moves LEFT to (3,4), then the enemy is at (3,4) and I am at (3,5). That's adjacent vertically? Actually, (3,4) is below (3,5). The enemy could then move UP into (3,5) on the next turn, which would be moving into my body if I am still at (3,5)? But I will be moving to (3,6) on turn 2. So if the enemy moves UP to (3,5) on turn 2, they would be moving into my tail? Let's simulate: Turn 1: I move RIGHT to (3,5). Enemy moves LEFT to (3,4). Turn 2: I move UP to (3,6). Enemy moves UP to (3,5). At the start of turn 2, my body is: head (3,5), tail (2,5). So (3,5) is my head. If the enemy moves UP to (3,5), they are moving into my head, which would cause them to die (since they move into my body). So the enemy would likely avoid that. Therefore, if the enemy is at (3,4) after turn 1, on turn 2 they might choose a different move, such as moving RIGHT to (4,4) or DOWN to (3,3), to avoid death. So that's fine.\n\nIf the enemy moves UP to (4,5) on turn 1, then from (4,5) they could move LEFT to (3,5) on turn 2, which again would be moving into my body (if I am at (3,5) at start of turn 2). So same issue. So the enemy will likely avoid moving into my path.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT might actually deter the enemy from approaching, which could be beneficial.\n\nOn the other hand, if I go UP, the enemy might be less deterred and might move towards (3,6) as well. For example, if I go UP to (2,6), and the enemy goes LEFT to (3,4), then on turn 2, I go RIGHT to (3,6), and the enemy could go UP to (3,5) or RIGHT to (4,4) etc. The enemy could also go UP to (3,5) from (3,4). That would put the enemy at (3,5) on turn 2. At that time, my head is at (3,6) (after moving), so the enemy is not colliding with my head. However, the enemy is at (3,5), which is adjacent to my head. That's okay. But on the next turn, I might go to (3,7) or elsewhere. The enemy could then potentially go to (3,6) while I am there, causing a head-on collision if we both move into (3,6). But that's later.\n\nSo both moves have risks.\n\nGiven that my primary objective is to survive and collect apples, and I have no immediate threats, I think either RIGHT or UP is reasonable. However, I need to choose one.\n\nI recall that in Snake games, it's often good to avoid the center early on to reduce collision risks, but here the center has many apples. Also, the enemy is in the center. So maybe moving towards the edge (LEFT or UP) is safer. But UP is towards the top edge, which might eventually become a trap if I go too far up. However, there are apples up there, so it's okay.\n\nLet's look at the board state again. I'll redraw a portion:\n\nTop rows:\n9: A . . . . . . . . A\n8: . . . . . . . . . .\n7: A A . A . . . . . .\n\nSo at y=9, there are apples at (0,9) and (9,9). At y=8, no apples. At y=7, apples at (0,7), (1,7), (3,7). So the upper-left has a cluster of apples.\n\nMy current y=5. Moving UP to y=6, then to y=7, I can collect those apples. That seems promising.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to x=3, y=5. Then I can go UP to y=6, then to y=7 at x=3, but there is an apple at (3,7). That's fine. But to get to (1,7) or (0,7), I would need to go LEFT from (3,7) or (2,7). That's possible.\n\nBut moving UP first brings me closer to the apple cluster at y=7, x=0-3. So that might be more efficient for collecting multiple apples in a row.\n\nAlso, note that there is an apple at (3,6) which is directly above me if I move UP? Actually from (2,5), UP goes to (2,6), not (3,6). (3,6) is to the right and up. So I need to move RIGHT or UP-right.\n\nBut if I go UP to (2,6), I can then go RIGHT to (3,6) to eat that apple, then UP to (3,7) to eat another apple, then LEFT to (2,7) or (1,7) etc. That's a nice sequence.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5), I can go UP to (3,6) then UP to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7) etc. Similar.\n\nBut from (2,6), I could also go UP to (2,7) which is empty, then LEFT to (1,7) to eat an apple, then DOWN to (1,6) or something. So there are options.\n\nGiven that the apple cluster at (0,7), (1,7), (3,7) is a nice chain, I might want to position myself to collect them efficiently. Starting from (2,5), going UP to (2,6) seems to align well with that cluster.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy's potential interest in those apples. The enemy is at (4,4), which is farther from that cluster. The enemy might go for the apples on the right side, like (6,5), (7,5), (8,4), etc. So I might be able to claim the left cluster without much competition.\n\nTherefore, I think moving UP is the better choice for now.\n\nLet's check safety of UP move in more detail. I'll also consider if the enemy might move to block me or something.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,6), the enemy might move LEFT to (3,4) or UP to (4,5). If the enemy moves UP to (4,5), that's not blocking me. If the enemy moves LEFT to (3,4), that's also not blocking. However, if the enemy moves UP to (4,5), then on the next turn, I go RIGHT to (3,6), and the enemy could go LEFT to (3,5). But as before, moving into (3,5) would be moving into my body if I am at (3,6)? At the start of turn 2, I am at (2,6). My body is at (2,5). So (3,5) is empty. So the enemy could move to (3,5) without immediate death. But that would put the enemy adjacent to my head. That's not ideal, but not fatal. Then on turn 3, I might go to (3,7) or (2,7). The enemy might go to (3,6) while I am there? That could cause a head-on collision if we both move into (3,6) at the same time. But I would be at (3,6) on turn 2 after moving, so on turn 3, I might move to (3,7). If the enemy moves to (3,6) on turn 3, they would be moving into a cell that I am leaving, so no collision. However, if the enemy moves to (3,6) on turn 2? They cannot because from (4,4) to (3,6) in one move is impossible. So no immediate concern.\n\nOverall, moving UP seems safe and sets up for a nice apple chain.\n\nNow, what about LEFT? LEFT to (1,5) would also bring me towards the left cluster, but it's more direct? From (1,5), I could go UP to (1,6) then UP to (1,7) to eat an apple. That's two moves to get an apple, same as UP then RIGHT to (3,6). But (1,7) is an apple, and (0,7) is also an apple. So LEFT might be good too. However, from (1,5), I'm closer to the left edge, which might reduce mobility later. Also, I'm moving away from the central apple (3,6) which is closer to my current position. (3,6) is only 2 Manhattan moves away, while (1,7) is 3 moves away. So (3,6) is the nearest apple. So I should prioritize the nearest apple unless there's a reason not to.\n\nThus, I think UP is the best move because it gets me closer to (3,6) and also towards the left cluster. Actually, from (2,5), UP to (2,6) changes Manhattan distance to (3,6) from 2 to 1? Actually, from (2,5) to (3,6) is 2 moves. From (2,6) to (3,6) is 1 move. So yes, it reduces the distance to 1. Similarly, RIGHT to (3,5) also reduces distance to (3,6) to 1 (since from (3,5) to (3,6) is 1). Both reduce to 1.\n\nSo both are equal in terms of proximity to (3,6). But UP brings me closer to other apples at y=7.\n\nLet's compute distances to other apples from (2,6) vs (3,5).\n\nFrom (2,6):\n- (3,6): 1\n- (3,7): 2 (up and right? Actually from (2,6) to (3,7) is dx=1, dy=1, so 2)\n- (1,7): dx=1, dy=1, so 2\n- (0,7): dx=2, dy=1, so 3\n- (1,6): empty, not an apple\n- (2,7): empty, not an apple\n\nFrom (3,5):\n- (3,6): 1\n- (3,7): 2 (up)\n- (1,7): dx=2, dy=2, so 4\n- (0,7): dx=3, dy=2, so 5\n- (6,5): dx=3, dy=0, so 3\n- (7,5): dx=4, dy=0, so 4\n\nSo (2,6) is better for the left cluster, (3,5) is better for the right cluster. Since the left cluster has multiple apples close together, I think (2,6) is better.\n\nAlso, note that there is an apple at (3,6) itself, which both positions can reach in one move. But after eating (3,6), I'll be at (3,6). From there, the left cluster apples (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (0,7) are all accessible. From (3,6), to get to (1,7), I could go LEFT to (2,6) then UP to (2,7) then LEFT to (1,7) or go LEFT to (2,6) then LEFT to (1,6) then UP to (1,7). So it's fine.\n\nBut from (2,6) as an intermediate, I could also go directly to (1,7) in two moves (UP to (2,7)? Actually from (2,6) to (1,7) is LEFT and UP, which is two moves (LEFT then UP or UP then LEFT). So still possible.\n\nI think moving UP is a solid choice.\n\nNow, I should also consider if there is any apple that is threatened by the enemy immediately. The enemy might move towards (6,5) or (7,5). Those are far from me. So no issue.\n\nOne more thing: the board has many apples, but some are in corners. I should avoid getting trapped in a corner. Moving UP to (2,6) is not a corner. Moving RIGHT to (3,5) is also safe.\n\nGiven the analysis, I'll choose UP.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\" My body is empty, enemy body empty. So no immediate concerns.\n\nAlso, \"Be constantly aware of the enemy snake and be making plans to outwit him and outlast him.\" So I should try to outmaneuver the enemy. Moving UP might allow me to collect the left cluster while the enemy goes for the right cluster, effectively dividing the board. That could be a good strategy to avoid conflict.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I might compete for the central apples, leading to potential conflicts. So UP seems more strategic for avoiding head-on collisions.\n\nThus, I'll go with UP.\n\nNow, for the final output, I need to provide a short rationale before the move. The rationale should be a plan for the next few turns. Then the final line must be exactly one word: UP.\n\nSo I'll write a rationale.\n\nRationale: I will move UP to (2,6) to get closer to the apple at (3,6) and the cluster at y=7. Next turn, I plan to move RIGHT to eat (3,6). Then I will aim for (3,7) or (1,7) depending on the enemy's position. This avoids immediate conflict with the enemy and secures early apples.\n\nThen final line: UP\n\nI should not mention future directions after the final word, so I'll stop there.I will move UP to (2,6) to position myself near the apple at (3,6) and the cluster of apples at y=7. This keeps me away from the enemy and opens paths to collect multiple apples safely. Next turn, I plan to move RIGHT to eat (3,6), then proceed to (3,7) or (1,7) based on the enemy's movement.\n\nUP",

          "move": "LEFT",
          "rationale": "Considering the board state, my current head at (2,7), and the enemy snake at (6,4), I need to make a move that ensures survival while positioning for apples. Let's evaluate the four directions:\n\n1. **UP (to (2,8))**: This is within the board (x=2, y=8). There are no obstacles at (2,8) according to the board state. It moves me away from the enemy (distance increases from ~4.47 to ~6.32). It also keeps me relatively close to the apple at (1,7) and (0,7) if I need to backtrack. This seems safe and maintains options.\n2. **DOWN (to (2,6))**: This is within the board. There is no obstacle at (2,6). However, moving down puts me slightly closer to the enemy. More importantly, if I move down now, I am moving away from the upper cluster of apples ((1,7), (0,7), (0,9), (9,9)). While there is an apple at (3,6) nearby, I am already adjacent to (3,7) which is also an apple. Moving UP keeps the upper cluster more accessible.\n3. **LEFT (to (1,7))**: This cell contains an apple (confirmed by board and apples list). Eating an apple is good, but I must consider the enemy's potential move. The enemy is at (6,4). If the enemy moves UP (to (6,5)) or LEFT (to (5,4)), it stays away from me. If the enemy moves RIGHT (to (7,4)), it stays away. If the enemy moves DOWN (to (6,3)), it stays away. The distance is large enough that a head-on collision is highly unlikely unless the enemy makes a very specific path towards me, which it hasn't shown signs of. However, I am currently at (2,7). If I eat (1,7), my body will extend behind me. Since I have no body currently, moving LEFT is safe from self-collision. The move is safe and gains a point immediately.\n4. **RIGHT (to (3,7))**: This cell also contains an apple. Similar to LEFT, this gains a point. The enemy is far away.\n\nComparing LEFT and RIGHT: Both give an immediate apple. LEFT (1,7) is slightly closer to the safe zone on the left side (0,7), (0,9) and the side wall. RIGHT (3,7) puts me closer to the center and the apple at (3,6) and (7,5). However, the enemy is at (6,4). If I go RIGHT, I am moving closer to the center where the enemy might roam. If I go LEFT, I am moving towards the corner/wall which is generally safer for survival.\n\nHowever, let's look at the board again.\nRow 7: `A A 1 A . . . . . .`\nMy head is at `1` (2,7).\n(1,7) is `A`.\n(3,7) is `A`.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,7), I eat an apple. My new head is (1,7). My body (currently empty) will extend from the old head (2,7). Next turn, I can move to (0,7) or (1,8) or (1,6) or back to (2,7). (0,7) is an apple. This looks like a very safe sequence: (2,7) -> (1,7) -> (0,7).\n\nIf I move UP to (2,8), I do not eat an apple. I position myself between the two apple clusters. I can then move to (1,8) -> (1,7) or (0,8) -> (0,7). This is slightly slower.\n\nSince the game is turn-based and I want to maximize points while staying safe, eating an apple now is preferable if it doesn't trap me. Moving LEFT to (1,7) seems the safest immediate play that also scores. It puts me adjacent to the wall (0,7) which acts as a natural barrier.\n\nLet's double check safety.\nEnemy is at (6,4). Distance is > 5 tiles. No immediate threat of head-on collision.\nBoard boundaries: (1,7) is inside.\nSelf collision: I have no body.\nObstacles: (1,7) is Apple.\n\nIs there any reason not to take the apple?\nIf I don't take the apple, I might lose it to the enemy if the enemy somehow navigates there (unlikely given the distance and obstacles) or I might just waste a turn.\nTaking the apple increases my score and length (though length doesn't matter much for survival yet since the board is empty).\n\nComparison with UP:\nUP to (2,8) is safe but passive. It leaves (1,7) and (0,7) for later. However, if I go UP, I am exposed to the center. If I go LEFT, I am hugging the left wall.\nHugging the wall is a classic Snake strategy for survival.\n\nLet's check the immediate follow-up options for LEFT (1,7):\n- (0,7): Apple.\n- (1,8): Empty.\n- (1,6): Empty.\n- (2,7): My previous body part (will be there if I don't eat, but since I eat, I grow. Wait, if I eat, I add a segment. The tail doesn't move forward immediately on the *same* turn I eat? No, in standard snake rules, if you eat, you grow. The tail stays for one turn. But in this specific game description: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\". This implies the body length increases.\n  *Important Check*: The description says \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail... the last tuple is the tail.\"\n  If I move to (1,7) and eat:\n  New Head: (1,7)\n  Old Head: (2,7) becomes part of the body.\n  Old Body: None.\n  New Body: (2,7).\n  Tail: (2,7)? No, usually the tail stays the same unless moving.\n  Let's re-read: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\n  Standard logic:\n  1. Head moves to new cell.\n  2. If food is eaten, tail does NOT pop off.\n  3. If no food, tail pops off.\n  So if I eat (1,7), my snake becomes Head:(1,7), Body:[(2,7)], Tail:(2,7)? No, the list is (Head, ..., Tail).\n  If I have 1 segment (Head + Tail connected), moving to food results in 2 segments.\n  Actually, I am currently just a Head (no body). If I eat, I become a 2-segment snake: Head (1,7), Body/Tail (2,7).\n  If I don't eat, I remain a 1-segment snake: Head (1,7), and the previous head (2,7) vanishes.\n  \n  Let's verify the current state: \"Head: (2, 7), Body: none, Apples: 0\".\n  If I move to (1,7) and eat:\n  New Head: (1,7).\n  The old head (2,7) becomes the new body/tail.\n  So the snake becomes: Head (1,7), Body (2,7).\n  Is (2,7) dangerous next turn?\n  If I am at (1,7) with body at (2,7), I cannot move back to (2,7) directly.\n  From (1,7), valid moves are (0,7), (1,8), (1,6). (2,7) is blocked by my own body.\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  If I move UP to (2,8) and do not eat:\n  New Head: (2,8).\n  No body.\n  This is also acceptable.\n\n  Which is better?\n  (1,7) gives a point immediately. (2,8) does not.\n  The distance to the nearest apples:\n  From (1,7): (0,7) is 1 step. (1,6) is 1 step. (1,8) is 1 step.\n  From (2,8): (1,7) is 2 steps (diagonal). (0,7) is 3 steps.\n  \n  The enemy is at (6,4). The enemy might target (7,5), (6,5), (7,6), etc. The enemy is far from my decision zone.\n  \n  Let's consider the \"trap\" potential.\n  If I go LEFT to (1,7), I am close to the wall.\n  Next turn, if I go to (0,7), I am at the wall. My tail will be at (2,7) or (1,7)? If I eat (1,7), then move to (0,7), I grow again. My body will be (1,7), (2,7).\n  If I am at (0,7) with body at (1,7) and (2,7), I can only go UP to (0,8) or DOWN to (0,6).\n  (0,6) is empty? Board row 6: `. . . A . . . A . A`. (0,6) is empty.\n  (0,8) is empty? Board row 8: `. . . . . . . . . .`. (0,8) is empty.\n  So I am not trapped.\n\n  What if I go UP to (2,8) first?\n  From (2,8), I can go to (1,8), (2,9), (3,8).\n  (2,9) is A (Row 9: `9 A . . . . . . . . A` -> (2,9) is `.` wait. Row 9 is y=9. (2,9) is x=2, y=9. The string is \"9 A . . . . . . . . A\".\n  Indices: 0:9, 1:A, 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:A.\n  So (0,9) is 9 (obstacle?), (1,9) is A, (2,9) is ., (9,9) is A.\n  Wait, looking at the board representation:\n  `9 A . . . . . . . . A`\n  This row corresponds to y=9. The first column (x=0) has value '9'.\n  Is '9' an obstacle or just a coordinate label?\n  The prompt says: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n  Usually, these ASCII boards label the axes.\n  Let's look at the leftmost column (x=0).\n  Row 9 (y=9): '9' at x=0? No, usually the number at the start of the row indicates the Y coordinate.\n  Example:\n  9 A . . . . . . . . A\n  8 . . . . . . . . . .\n  ...\n  So the '9' at the start of the line is just the Y-coordinate label. The board cells start at the space after the digit.\n  Let's align this.\n  Row 9: `9 A . . . . . . . . A`\n  Row 8: `8 . . . . . . . . . .`\n  \n  If the digit is the label, then the cells are:\n  Row 9 (y=9): A at (1,9), . at (2,9)... A at (9,9).\n  Row 8 (y=8): . at (0,8)... . at (9,8).\n  \n  So (2,9) is Empty. (1,9) is Apple.\n  If I go UP to (2,8), I am adjacent to (1,9) (Apple) and (2,9) (Empty) and (1,8) (Empty).\n  \n  If I go LEFT to (1,7), I am adjacent to (0,7) (Apple), (1,6) (Empty), (1,8) (Empty).\n  \n  Both are good.\n  \n  However, there is a dense cluster of apples on the left side:\n  (0,7), (1,7), (0,9), (0,2), (1,9).\n  On the right side:\n  (9,6), (9,9), (9,1).\n  In the middle:\n  (7,5), (7,1), (8,4), (6,0), (6,5), (3,7), (3,6), (7,6).\n  \n  My position (2,7) is very close to the left-side cluster. It makes sense to secure those first.\n  (1,7) is an apple. (0,7) is an apple.\n  If I take (1,7) now, next turn I can take (0,7).\n  That's 2 apples secured in 2 turns.\n  \n  If I go UP to (2,8), the nearest apples are (1,7) and (1,9).\n  To get (1,7), I have to backtrack or move left/down.\n  To get (1,9), I need to go (2,8)->(1,8)->(1,9) or (2,8)->(2,9)->(1,9).\n  That's 2 or 3 turns for 1 apple, vs 2 turns for 2 apples on the left.\n  \n  The left side is clearly more valuable and efficient for me right now.\n  \n  Is there any danger in going LEFT?\n  The enemy is at (6,4).\n  The enemy might move to (5,4) or (7,4) or (6,5) or (6,3).\n  None of these moves bring the enemy close to (1,7) in one turn.\n  Even if the enemy moves UP repeatedly, it will take many turns to reach my zone.\n  I am safe to forage on the left.\n  \n  Let's check the board for obstacles between me and the left wall.\n  Row 7: `A A 1 A ...`\n  My head is at (2,7).\n  (1,7) is Apple.\n  (0,7) is Apple.\n  Row 6: `. . . A ...` -> (0,6), (1,6), (2,6) are Empty.\n  Row 8: `. . . ...` -> (0,8), (1,8) are Empty.\n  \n  The path is clear.\n  \n  Let's consider the enemy's potential moves this turn.\n  Enemy at (6,4).\n  Apples near enemy: (7,5), (6,5), (7,6), (3,6), (3,7), (8,4), (6,0).\n  The enemy is likely to go for (7,5) (UP/RIGHT) or (6,5) (UP) or (3,6) (LEFT/UP).\n  If the enemy goes LEFT towards (3,6), it moves further away from me.\n  If the enemy goes UP/RIGHT towards (7,5), it moves slightly closer but still far away (~6 tiles distance).\n  \n  I am confident that moving LEFT is safe and optimal.\n  \n  One final check on \"Moving directly backwards\".\n  I am at (2,7). I have no body. So I cannot hit myself.\n  \n  Decision: Move LEFT to (1,7) to eat the apple.\n\nMy plan for the next turn is to move to (0,7) to eat the next apple, continuing to secure the left side of the board.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "I will analyze the current board state to determine the optimal move.\n\n**1. Analyze Immediate Threats and Safety:**\n*   **My Position:** (1, 7) (Head), Body: [(2, 7)] (from previous turn's move).\n*   **Enemy Position:** (6, 5) (Head), Body: [(6, 4)].\n*   **Board Boundaries:** (1, 7) is valid.\n*   **Self Collision:** I must check if moving back to (2, 7) is possible. Since I just moved from (2, 7) to (1, 7), and (2, 7) is currently my body, moving back would result in death. Therefore, **LEFT is forbidden**.\n*   **Enemy Collision:**\n    *   Current distance to enemy head: $\\sqrt{(6-1)^2 + (5-7)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 4} \\approx 5.38$.\n    *   If I move UP to (1, 8): Distance $\\approx \\sqrt{25 + 9} \\approx 5.8$.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (1, 6): Distance $\\approx \\sqrt{25 + 1} \\approx 5.1$.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (2, 7): Distance $\\approx \\sqrt{16 + 4} \\approx 4.47$.\n    *   The enemy is likely moving towards apples (7, 6), (8, 4), or (7, 5). While moving RIGHT brings me closer to the enemy's zone, it is not immediately fatal, but it is less safe than moving away.\n    *   **Visual Check:** The board shows (1, 7) is an apple. I am currently eating it. The cell (0, 7) is also an apple. Moving LEFT is unavailable. Moving UP to (1, 8) keeps me safe from the enemy and sets up (0, 7) and (1, 9). Moving DOWN to (1, 6) moves me away from the (0, 7) apple but towards (1, 5) and (1, 4).\n\n**2. Evaluate Move Options:**\n*   **LEFT (1, 7) -> (0, 7):** Blocked by my own body (2, 7 is currently body, and the path 1,7 -> 0,7 is adjacent, but the rule \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\" usually applies to the cell immediately behind the head. In this specific game state, (2, 7) is directly behind (1, 7). So moving LEFT is death. **REJECTED**.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 7) -> (2, 7):** This is moving back into the body. **REJECTED**.\n*   **UP (1, 7) -> (1, 8):** Valid. Empty. Moves towards (0, 7) and (1, 9). Increases distance from enemy. Safe.\n*   **DOWN (1, 7) -> (1, 6):** Valid. Empty. Moves away from (0, 7). Safe.\n\n**3. Strategy Selection:**\nI am at (1, 7). I have just eaten the apple at (1, 7). My body is at (2, 7). I want to collect the apple at (0, 7).\nTo reach (0, 7), I cannot go directly left because of my body.\nI must go around.\nOption A: UP -> (1, 8) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 7). (3 moves to apple).\nOption B: DOWN -> (1, 6) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 7). (3 moves to apple).\nOption C: UP -> (1, 8) -> (1, 9) -> (0, 9). (There is an apple at (0, 9) and (1, 9)? No, (1, 9) is empty, (0, 9) is apple).\nActually, looking at the board representation:\nRow 9: `A . . . . . . . . A` (Wait, the labels are there).\nRow 9: `9 A . . . . . . . . A` -> (0,9) is 9 (coordinate), (1,9) is A.\nRow 8: `8 . . . . . . . . . .` -> (0,8) is 8, (1,8) is .\nRow 7: `7 A A . . . . . . . .` -> (0,7) is 7, (1,7) is A, (2,7) is A.\nWait, my previous move was LEFT to (1, 7). The apple at (1, 7) is now eaten (I am there).\nThe apple at (0, 7) is still there.\n\nLet's look at the apples list:\n(0, 7) is an apple.\n(0, 9) is an apple.\n(1, 7) is an apple (currently being eaten).\n\nIf I go UP to (1, 8):\nI am at (1, 8).\nNext turn, I can move to (0, 8) or (1, 9) or (2, 8).\n(0, 8) leads to (0, 7).\n(1, 9) leads to (0, 9).\n(2, 8) leads to... nowhere good immediately.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 6):\nI am at (1, 6).\nNext turn, I can move to (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 6).\n(0, 6) leads to (0, 7).\n(1, 5) leads to... (1, 4) maybe?\n(0, 6) is empty.\n\n**Comparison of UP vs DOWN:**\n*   **UP to (1, 8):**\n    *   Targets: (0, 7) and (0, 9).\n    *   Safety: (1, 8) is empty. (1, 9) is empty. (0, 9) is apple.\n    *   Enemy: Enemy is at (6, 5). Moving UP moves me away from the enemy (distance increases).\n*   **DOWN to (1, 6):**\n    *   Targets: (0, 7).\n    *   Safety: (1, 6) is empty. (0, 6) is empty.\n    *   Enemy: Moving DOWN keeps distance roughly the same or decreases slightly (vertical distance decreases from 2 to 1).\n\n**Decision:**\nGoing UP is strictly better.\n1.  It moves me further away from the enemy (y-distance increases from 2 to 3).\n2.  It offers access to *two* apples ((0, 7) and (0, 9)) in a safe corridor on the left edge.\n3.  Going DOWN funnels me into a narrower space (y=0 is bottom) with fewer immediate high-value targets.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (1, 8). From there, navigate to (0, 9) via (1, 9) or (0, 8). Secure the left wall apples. Avoid the center where the enemy is active.\n\n**Final Move Selection:**\nUP is the safe move that keeps the left wall cluster accessible and maximizes distance from the enemy.\n\nUP",

I previously moved UP from (1, 7).\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head: (7, 5), Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4)].\n*   **Apples:** Many apples exist, but I am focusing on the cluster at (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 9), and (1, 1) if I survive long enough.\n*   **Immediate Environment (1, 8):**\n    *   UP: (1, 9) - Empty.\n    *   DOWN: (1, 7) - My body (Death).\n    *   LEFT: (0, 8) - Empty.\n    *   RIGHT: (2, 8) - Empty.\n\n**2. Evaluate Move Options (Safety & Strategy):**\n*   **DOWN:** Moving back to (1, 7) hits my own body. **Forbidden**.\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (2, 8). While technically safe, it moves me closer to the enemy (currently at x=7) and away from the dense apple cluster on the left edge (x=0). This seems counter-productive to long-term survival and scoring.\n*   **LEFT:** Moves to (0, 8). This positions me on the left wall.\n    *   *Pros:* Moves towards apples at (0, 7) and (0, 9). Increases distance from the enemy.\n    *   *Cons:* (0, 8) is a specific spot. From (0, 8), I could go UP to (0, 9) (Apple) or DOWN to (0, 7) (Apple). However, entering the corner (0, 9) restricts future movement to only (0, 8) or (1, 9).\n*   **UP:** Moves to (1, 9).\n    *   *Pros:* (1, 9) is empty. It is directly adjacent to the apple at (0, 9) and the apple at (1, 9) is not listed (wait, looking at the board: `9 A . . . . . . . . A`. (1, 9) is the space immediately to the right of (0, 9). So (1, 9) is empty. (0, 9) is an apple. (0, 7) is an apple.\n    *   From (1, 9), I can move LEFT to (0, 9) to eat the apple.\n    *   *Safety:* The enemy is at (7, 5). The distance is significant. Vertical movement away (UP) is good.\n\n**3. Decision Logic (UP vs LEFT):**\n*   **LEFT to (0, 8):** This is a solid move. It puts me on the wall. However, looking at the board geometry, (0, 8) is a \"transit\" cell. If I go LEFT, I commit to the wall.\n*   **UP to (1, 9):** This keeps me slightly more flexible. I am not yet pinned to the wall. I can choose next turn to either take the apple at (0, 9) (by going LEFT) or turn around and head for (0, 7) if the enemy approaches the top.\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   If I go UP to (1, 9): Next turn I can go LEFT to (0, 9) (Apple) or DOWN to (1, 8) (safe).\n    *   If I go LEFT to (0, 8): Next turn I can go UP to (0, 9) (Apple) or DOWN to (0, 7) (Apple).\n    *   Both are good.\n    *   However, (1, 9) is \"one step further\" from the enemy than (0, 8) is? No, distance is similar.\n    *   **Crucial Observation:** The enemy is at (7, 5). They are on the right side. I am on the left. Moving UP keeps me moving away from them vertically.\n    *   **Flexibility:** Being at (1, 9) feels slightly more flexible than (0, 8) because (0, 8) is a bottleneck (only two directions). (1, 9) is a corner cell (two directions), but it leads to a 2x2 open space (1,9)-(2,9)-(1,8)-(2,8).\n    *   **Apple Access:** (1, 9) is adjacent to (0, 9). (0, 8) is adjacent to (0, 9) and (0, 7).\n    *   Given the enemy is on the right, moving UP to (1, 9) maximizes distance. It also sets up the capture of the top-left apple (0, 9) next turn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI will move UP to (1, 9). This maximizes distance from the enemy and prepares to eat the apple at (0, 9) on the next turn. It is safe and offers good future options.\n\nUP",
