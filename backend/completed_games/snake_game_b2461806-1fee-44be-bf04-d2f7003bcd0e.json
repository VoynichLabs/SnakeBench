Eating it will increase our points and grow the snake.\n- Moving LEFT to (6, 9) is safe but doesn't immediately help with any other goal.\n- Moving DOWN to (7, 8) is safe but less advantageous now since we already have a clear immediate opportunity at (8, 9).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2, 4) with body parts at (2, 5) and (2, 6), far from our current position. No threat from it in the immediate vicinity.\n\nWe should proceed to eat the apple at (8, 9). Moving RIGHT is the optimal move, as it aligns with our goal of collecting the nearby apple and growing.\n\nConfirmed, moving RIGHT will collect the apple at (8, 9), is safe from obstacles, and positions us well for future moves.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Looking at our options:\n\n\u2022 UP \u2192 (2,5) is occupied by our own body.\n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (2,3) is free. From there the Manhattan distance to (3,3) becomes 1.\n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 (1,4) is free, but from there the distance to (3,3) would be 3.\n\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 (3,4) is free as well, and the Manhattan distance to (3,3) would be 1.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT, both yield an equally short distance (1) to the target apple. However, moving RIGHT offers a clear, direct path because it positions us directly in line horizontally with (3,3) so we can easily move DOWN on our next turn. It also avoids any potential risk associated with the snake\u2019s own body above us.\n\nThus, my strategy is to steer the snake toward the apple at (3,3) while staying safe from self-collision. I\u2019ll move RIGHT now, setting up to move DOWN on the following turn if needed.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
