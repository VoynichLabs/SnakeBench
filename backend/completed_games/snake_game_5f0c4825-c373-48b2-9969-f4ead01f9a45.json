That suggests we came from above, so moving down again will carry us closer to the apple.\n- The board is clear of immediate obstacles in this direction:\n  - No walls at y=1 or y=0 within reach.\n  - Enemy snake is at (4, 1), which is well away from this path.\n  - No risk of colliding with ourselves (our body at (6, 1) and our head at (6, 2)) if we go down; moving into (6, 1) would cause collision, but moving down from (6, 2) moves into (6, 1). Since our current position is (6, 2), and the body is at (6, 1), going down would cause us to run into ourselves, which is forbidden.\n\nWait, that indicates a mistake: moving DOWN from (6, 2) to (6, 1) would be colliding with our own body, which is at (6, 1). That would kill us.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN is **not** a safe move at this moment.\n\nInstead, let's consider other options:\n\n- **Up:** Moving back to (6, 3). Not optimal; doesn't bring us closer to the apple.\n- **Left:** To (5, 2): No apple in that direction; also, check if this is safe:\n  - (5, 2) is free; no obstacle. Moving left may lengthen the route.\n- **Right:** To (7, 2): also free, but not closer to any apple.\n\nSince the apple is at (6, 0), and moving down would cause a collision with our own body, the best move is to go **Left** to (5, 2).\n\nNext, from (5, 2), we can move down again to (5, 1) then down to (5, 0) to reach the apple.\n\nLet's confirm the safety:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 2): no obstacle.\n- Our path toward the apple is now accessible by moving downwards at subsequent steps.\n\n**Strategy next turn:** Move LEFT to position (5, 2).\n\n**Final decision:** LEFT"

          "rationale": "I\u2019ll think out loud:\n\nOur snake\u2019s head is now at (4,0) after moving DOWN last turn. Our current apple positions are at (5,6), (4,9), (4,8), (3,9), and (9,3). (Recall that the \u201capple\u201d mentioned at (6,0) in the previous move was in fact an enemy snake head.) We want to head toward the apple that minimizes our Manhattan distance; from (4,0) the distances are:\n\n\u2022 (5,6): |5\u20134| + |6\u20130| = 1 + 6 = 7  \n\u2022 (9,3): |9\u20134| + |3\u20130| = 5 + 3 = 8  \n\u2022 (4,9): 0 + 9 = 9  \n\u2022 (4,8): 0 + 8 = 8  \n\u2022 (3,9): 1 + 9 = 10\n\nSo the apple at (5,6) is closest.\n\nNow, from our head at (4,0) our possible moves are:\n\n\u2022 UP goes to (4,1), but that cell is still occupied by our own body (our snake occupies (4,1) and (4,2) as its segments right now).  \n\u2022 DOWN is off-board (would go to (4,-1)).  \n\u2022 LEFT leads to (3,0); however, the Manhattan distance to (5,6) from (3,0) becomes |5\u20133| + |6\u20130| = 2 + 6 = 8, which is worse.  \n\u2022 RIGHT goes to (5,0); from there the Manhattan distance becomes |5\u20135| + |6\u20130| = 0 + 6 = 6, making progress toward our target.\n\nThere are no immediate hazards on the (5,0) cell, and it doesn\u2019t put us in conflict with the enemy snake whose head is at (6,0) (which we\u2019ll avoid since it remains dangerous).\n\nThus, to move closer to the apple at (5,6) while keeping a safe distance from enemy threats, I decide to move RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
