Let's quickly reassess the available apples and see which one is closest now:\n\nRemaining apples listed:\n- (2,4), (5,3), (4,6), (3,9), (6,8)\n\nThe nearest apple from my current position (0,2) appears to be (2,4). This makes sense to target next, since it is reasonably close and directly up-and-right diagonally from my position. Let's plan a safe, obstacle-free route toward that apple.\n\nPotential immediate moves:\n- UP to (0,3): clear, no obstacle.\n- RIGHT to (1,2): clear, no obstacle.\n\nMy best strategy is thus to move upwards first, since going UP puts me closer vertically to the apple, and gives me flexibility for the next turn to move rightward towards the (2,4) apple.\n\nAlso, enemy snake #2 remains far away at position (9,6), currently posing no immediate threat.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\nContinue evaluating surroundings carefully, notably maintaining awareness of snake #2's future movements. Closely track apple locations and prioritize nearest apples safely.\n\nNext move: UP"
