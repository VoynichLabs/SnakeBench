Going UP moves directly toward it.\n\n**Enemy snake #0 at (3,8):**\nIt is also close to (1,8) (distance 2: left 2, same row). However, it might also go for that apple. But note:\n- If I go UP to (1,7), I am one step away from (1,8).\n- Enemy could move LEFT to (2,8) or DOWN to (3,7) etc., but it has multiple options. If it moves LEFT twice (to (2,8) then (1,8)), it would take 2 turns to reach (1,8). I can reach (1,8) in 2 turns (UP now to (1,7), then UP again to (1,8)).\n\nBut we must consider simultaneous movement: if both try to go to (1,8) on the same turn, we might collide head-on. However, that is not this turn.\n\nThis turn: I am at (1,6), enemy at (3,8). No immediate collision risk.\n\nNext turn: if I go UP to (1,7), enemy might move to (2,8) or (3,7) etc. Then I can go UP again to (1,8) and get the apple. Enemy might also go to (1,8) from (2,8) if it moves LEFT, but that would be a head-on collision if we both go to (1,8) at the same time. So we need to be cautious next turn.\n\nBut for this turn, going UP is best to get closer to the apple.\n\nOther apples are farther, so not as attractive.\n\nAlso, going UP keeps me in the game for the (1,8) apple. Going other directions would move me away.\n\nSo UP is the best.\n\n**Short-term plan:**\nGo UP to (1,7) this turn. Next turn, if enemy is not too close to (1,8), go UP to (1,8) to get the apple. If enemy is heading to (1,8) (e.g., it moves LEFT to (2,8)), I might consider waiting or avoiding head-on collision. But for now, UP.\n\nAll other moves are safe but less efficient.\n\nFinal choice:\nUP",

I can still get the apple later if the enemy doesn't take it.\n\n**Safe alternatives:**\n- DOWN: (1,6) - moves away from enemy and apple, but safe.\n- LEFT: (0,7) - safe, but not toward any apple.\n- RIGHT: (2,7) - safe, and moves toward the center where more apples are.

Let's check:  \nManhattan distance = |3-5| + |6-8| = 2+2=4? Wait my math is wrong: |3-5|=2, |6-8|=2, 2+2=4. So 4 cells apart \u2014 impossible to collide this turn (need distance \u2264 2 for collision possible in 1 move). So head-on collision impossible.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nClosest apple to me: (4, 3) \u2014 distance |3-4| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4.  \nOther apples: (1, 8) \u2014 distance 8, (8, 3) \u2014 distance 8, (8, 8) \u2014 distance 9, (9, 7) \u2014 distance 9.  \n(4, 3) is clearly the best target \u2014 plus it's away from enemy at (5,8).\n\nTo get to (4, 3):\n- Fastest path: x=3\u21924 eventually, y=6\u21923.\n- This turn: moving RIGHT (4,6) gets x aligned and closer in x.  \n- Moving DOWN (3,5) gets y closer.  \nWhich is better?

RIGHT keeps me more central.\n\n**Enemy threat:**\nEnemy might go for (1,8) or (8,8) or (9,7), but they're closer to those than I am. Getting (4,3) seems uncontested.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT keeps me safer, progresses toward (4,3), and maintains central flexibility.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nMove toward (4,3) while watching enemy. From (4,6) next turn, likely go DOWN unless enemy interferes. Avoid moving toward top apples while enemy is up there.\n\nPlanning to go RIGHT this turn.\n\nRIGHT",

Next turn I can go DOWN (3,3) or LEFT (3,3) etc., keeping options open.  \n\nOther apples: (8,3) is at same y=3 but far east. After eating (4,3), maybe head toward (8,3) but avoid enemy path. Enemy is near (8,8) and (9,7), so (8,3) might be safe to target soon.  \n\n**Plan for next turns**:  \nAfter eating apple (4,3), assess enemy movement. Possibly move left or down next to avoid boxing myself in top-right corner later.  \n\n**Best move now**: DOWN to eat apple.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, board state:\n  Row 8: . A . . . . . . 0 .\nSo (1,8) is apple, (8,8) is enemy head. So enemy is on (8,8) which is not an apple?

Also, enemy is far and likely going for northern apples first.\n\nCheck for immediate dangers: if I go RIGHT to (6,3), no enemy can reach there this turn (enemy at (8,8) max move to (9,8) or (8,9) or (7,8), all far).\n\nSo RIGHT is safe and progress.\n\nWhat about UP? (5,4) is also safe and moves toward (6,7). But (6,7) is farther than (8,3)? Actually, Manhattan: from (5,3) to (6,7) is |1| + |4| = 5, to (8,3) is |3| + |0| = 3.

They are 5 steps away vertically. They cannot reach (7,3) in one move. So it's safe.\n\nUP to (6,4) moves toward (6,7) apple, which is 3 steps away (Manhattan: |0| + |3| = 3).

So I have a clear path to these apples without immediate competition.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT to (7,3) leaves me with good options: next turn I can go RIGHT to (8,3) to eat the apple, or UP/DOWN if needed.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue east to secure (8,3) and (9,3) apples. After that, consider moving north toward (6,7) if enemy hasn't taken it, or other apples. Monitor enemy movement; they are likely staying north for (6,7) or (9,7).\n\nRationale: LEFT is backwards and deadly. UP risks competition with enemy for (6,7) since enemy is closer. DOWN retreats.

So they cannot go UP.\n- DOWN to (7,6) - empty.\n- LEFT to (6,7) - there is an apple! So they can move LEFT to eat (6,7) if they want.\n- RIGHT to (8,7) - empty.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. They are likely to go LEFT to (6,7) for the apple.\n\nBetween me and enemy: I am at (7,3) and enemy at (7,7). There is no direct collision risk this turn because I am moving to (8,3) and enemy might move to (6,7) or other. The paths don't cross.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move: it secures an apple and grows my snake. This also positions me well for the next apple at (9,3) or to move north toward (9,7) later.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (8,3), next turn consider moving RIGHT to (9,3) for another apple, or UP to (8,4) to start moving toward the north apples. Monitor enemy; they may have taken (6,7) and might be heading south or east. Avoid head-on collisions in the future.\n\nRationale: RIGHT gets an apple and is safe. UP and DOWN are safe but less productive. LEFT is deadly.\n\nRIGHT",

That gives me 3 apples and grows length to 4.  \nBut check consequences: after RIGHT, my head will be at (9, 3), body: [(8,3), (7,3), (6,3)].  \nNext turn options from (9, 3): likely only UP to (9, 4) or DOWN to (9, 2) since RIGHT off board, LEFT back into my body (8, 3). So only 1\u20132 moves possible next turn \u2014 risk of dead end at east edge.  \n\nUP: (8, 4) \u2014 no apple, but from there I can go UP again to (8, 5) approaching (7, 5) apple, or LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN \u2014 more options.  \n\nEnemy #0: From (6, 7), they likely ate (6, 7) apple last turn (since it's gone now per board state; comparing apple list: earlier had (6,7)? Actually apple list doesn't show (6,7) now, so enemy might have eaten it before?). They now have body [(7,7), (7,8)] so their tail is at (7,8) \u2014 possibly tail moved after eating? Wait, let's reconstruct enemy movement:  \nLast turn: enemy head (6,7) \u2192 might have moved to adjacent apple (6,7)? But starting apple list last turn had (6,7)?? Actually last turn apples given: (1,8), (8,3), (9,7), (9,3), (6,7). Now (6,7) apple missing, so enemy ate it. So enemy length now 3 \u2014 head (6,7)? No, current enemy head is (6,7) in this turn's board (from current board visual: \"Snake #0 - Head: (6, 7), Body: [(7, 7), (7, 8)]\"), so their head moved to (6,7) apple last turn \u2014 so their tail stayed? Actually if they ate apple, they grow \u2014 so they should have 3 segments total now: [(6,7), (old head at 7,7), (7,8)]. Yes, so enemy body is [(7,7), (7,8)] and head at (6,7), so total segments = 3 correct.  \n\nRisk: Enemy next moves from (6,7): safe moves? Their body at (7,7) and (7,8). They can go LEFT to (5,7), DOWN to (6,6), UP to (6,8), but not RIGHT into (7,7). Possible they move toward apples at (1,8) or (7,5)? Not immediate collision risk with me.  \n\nRIGHT gets apple but corners me. UP keeps options open, also gets me closer to (7,5) apple directly: after UP to (8,4), next turn UP to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5) eats apple.  \n\nRIGHT yields immediate gain but limits options. UP yields less immediate reward but better maneuverability. Given turn 13 / 150 \u2014 no need to gamble on trapping myself yet.  \n\nBetter path: go UP, then plan route for (7,5) apple while keeping space to escape.  \n\n**Final decision:** UP for safety and flexibility.  \n\nUP",

Wait: body is [(8,5), (8,4)] \u2014 (8,5) is directly behind head, so moving LEFT into (8,5) would hit my own body \u2192 deadly.\n- RIGHT \u2192 off board (x=10) \u2192 deadly.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n- DOWN to (9,4) gets an apple immediately. This grows me to length 4.\n- UP to (9,6) is safe but no immediate reward.\n\n**Enemy snake #0 at (7,7): possible moves:**\n- UP: (7,8) \u2014 empty\n- DOWN: (7,6) \u2014 its own body (deadly)\n- LEFT: (6,7) \u2014 empty\n- RIGHT: (8,7) \u2014 empty\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Risks:**\n- Enemy might move RIGHT to (8,7), which is not adjacent to my head (I\u2019m at (9,5)), so no direct collision threat this turn.\n- After I move, next turn my head will be either at (9,6) or (9,4).\n- If I go DOWN to (9,4) and eat apple, my body becomes [(9,5), (8,5), (8,4)] \u2014 tail still at (8,4) for now.\n\n**Future considerations:**\n- Going DOWN to (9,4) gives an apple and positions me near other apples: (9,3) below and (7,5) to the left (but blocked by my body initially).\n- Going UP to (9,6) is safe but less rewarding; might set up for (9,7) apple later.\n\nSince DOWN is safe and gets an apple, it is highly favorable. It also avoids any risk of head-on collision this turn (enemy cannot reach my cell).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating apple at (9,4), head at (9,4) with body [(9,5), (8,5), (8,4)]. Next turn, safe moves from (9,4): UP (back to (9,5) \u2014 now body segment? Wait: after growth, body is [(9,5), (8,5), (8,4)] \u2014 so (9,5) is body, so UP to (9,5) is deadly. Other moves: DOWN to (9,3) (apple), LEFT to (8,4) (body segment? (8,4) is tail \u2014 but since we just ate, tail doesn\u2019t move this turn? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow at the end of the turn, so the tail stays in place for that turn. Then next turn, when you move, the tail moves unless you eat again. So after moving to (9,4) and eating, the body becomes: head (9,4), then (9,5), (8,5), (8,4). So next turn from (9,4):\n- UP: (9,5) is body \u2192 deadly\n- DOWN: (9,3) is free (and apple)\n- LEFT: (8,4) is body (tail) \u2192 but if we don\u2019t eat, tail moves? Actually, if we don\u2019t eat next turn, the tail will move forward, so (8,4) becomes free? Wait no: the body list is fixed until next move. So at the start of next turn, body is [(9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,4)] if we grow. Then when we move without eating, the tail (last segment) is removed. So if we move from (9,4) without eating, the new body becomes [new head, (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)] and tail (8,4) is gone. So LEFT to (8,4) is safe only if we eat? Actually, no: at the moment of move, (8,4) is still part of the body until after movement. So it is deadly to move into it. So next turn from (9,4), only DOWN to (9,3) is safe (and gets apple). So going DOWN now sets up a potential chain to get (9,3) next turn.\n\nThis is a good opportunity to collect consecutive apples.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Actually, last turn I moved from (9,3) to (8,3) via LEFT. But I did not eat an apple at (8,3), so I should not have grown. Let's verify:\n\nLast turn, my head was at (8,3) and I moved LEFT to (8,3)? Wait, no: last turn my head was at (9,3) and I moved LEFT to (8,3). There was no apple at (8,3), so I should not have grown. Therefore, my tail should have moved. So my current body should be: head at (8,3), then (9,3) [which was the old head], (9,4), (9,5), and the tail (8,5) should have been left behind? Actually, when you don't eat, the tail moves. So the new body is: head (8,3), then (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). The tail (8,5) is gone. So length is 4.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\nMy snake: Head: (8,3), Body: [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)] \u2014 this is inconsistent with the rules. If I moved from (9,3) to (8,3) and didn't eat, my body should be [(8,3) head, (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)] and the tail (8,5) should be removed. But the board shows (8,5) still in the body. Perhaps there was an apple at (8,3)? The apples are at (1,8), (7,5), (6,7), (0,2), (2,6). No apple at (8,3). So it seems the board state provided might have an error? Or I miscounted.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n  3 . . . . . . . . 1 T\nThe \"1\" is my head at (8,3). The \"T\" at (9,3) is my body? Actually, the board has:\n 3 . . . . . . . . 1 T\nSo (8,3) is head, (9,3) is body. Then (9,4) and (9,5) are also body. And (8,5) is tail? But (8,5) is not adjacent to (9,5). So it might be that the body is not contiguous? That is not possible. There is a disconnect: from (9,5) to (8,5) is a jump. This suggests that the board state might be misrepresented or I am misreading.\n\nGiven the provided board state, I must work with what is given. So my body is [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (8,5)] with head at (8,3). Even though it doesn't make sense (since (8,5) is not adjacent to (9,5)), I'll assume it is correct for this turn.\n\nSo from head (8,3):\n- UP: (8,4) \u2014 empty? Board shows (8,4) is empty (no symbol).\n- DOWN: (8,2) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT: (7,3) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT: (9,3) \u2014 my own body (deadly).\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Enemy snake #0 at (9,8): body [(9,7), (8,7), (7,7)]**\nIts possible moves:\n- UP: (9,9) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN: (9,7) \u2014 its own body (deadly).\n- LEFT: (8,8) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT: off board (deadly).\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk: my moves are to (8,4), (8,2), (7,3); enemy to (9,9) or (8,8).\n\n**Future considerations:**\nI should move toward apples. Closest apples: (7,5) and (6,7) are near. Also (0,2) and (2,6) are farther.\n\nFrom (8,3):\n- UP to (8,4): then I can go to (8,5) (which is currently my tail? But if I move, my tail might change) or (7,4) or (9,4) (body). Actually, careful: if I move to (8,4), my new body becomes [(8,4) head, (8,3), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)] and the tail (8,5) is gone? But wait, the current body has (8,5) as tail. When I move without eating, the tail should move. So the new body should be head (8,4), then (8,3), (9,3), (9,4), and the last segment (9,5) becomes the new tail? Actually, the tail moves one step: the segment at (8,5) is removed. So the new body is [(8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4)]. So from (8,4), safe moves would be UP (8,5) free, DOWN (8,3) body, LEFT (7,4) free, RIGHT (9,4) body. So two safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nSimilarly, DOWN to (8,2): new body: head (8,2), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4). Tail (9,5) is gone. From (8,2): UP (8,3) body, DOWN (8,1) free, LEFT (7,2) free, RIGHT (9,2) free. So three safe moves.\n\nLEFT to (7,3): new body: head (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4). Tail (9,5) gone. From (7,3): UP (7,4) free, DOWN (7,2) free, LEFT (6,3) free, RIGHT (8,3) body. So three safe moves.\n\nSo DOWN and LEFT both give 3 future options, UP gives only 2.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n(7,5) is at (7,5). From (8,3), going UP to (8,4) gets closer to (7,5) than DOWN or LEFT? Actually, (7,5) is north-west. UP moves north, LEFT moves west. So both are good. But UP has fewer future moves.\n\nDOWN moves away from (7,5) and (6,7).\n\nSo prefer UP or LEFT.\n\nBut UP has only 2 future moves, while LEFT has 3. So LEFT is better.\n\nAlso, LEFT moves toward the center and away from the crowded right edge.\n\nEnemy is at (9,8) and might go to (8,8) or (9,9). It is not a direct threat.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (7,3). Then next turn, consider moving UP to (7,4) or LEFT to (6,3) to approach (7,5) or (6,7).\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT is safe, gives good future options, and moves toward apples.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

My new tail is the last segment of the previous body, (9,4).\n\n**Safe moves from (7,5):**\n- **UP**: (7,6) \u2013 Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: (7,4) \u2013 This is my own body segment (the first segment behind my head). Deadly. Eliminated.\n- **LEFT**: (6,5) \u2013 Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (8,5) \u2013 Empty. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves are: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Apple and Enemy Analysis:**\n- Apples at: (1,8), (6,7), (0,2), (2,6), (4,4)\n- The closest apple is at (6,7), which is UP-LEFT from my head.\n- Snake #0's head is at (6,8). It is very close to the apple at (6,7). It can move DOWN to (6,7) to eat it, LEFT to (5,8), UP to (6,9), or RIGHT to (7,8) (its own body). So it is highly likely to move DOWN to (6,7) this turn.\n\n**Risk of Head-on Collision:**\n- If I move LEFT to (6,5), I am safe.\n- If I move UP to (7,6), I am safe.\n- If I move RIGHT to (8,5), I am safe.\n- There is no direct collision risk with Snake #0 this turn, as it is at (6,8) and its possible moves are (6,7), (5,8), (6,9), (7,8). None of these are my target cells.\n\n**Future Mobility and Strategy:**\n- Moving UP to (7,6) puts me in a good position to potentially go towards (6,7) next, but note that Snake #0 is likely to eat (6,7) this turn. After that, the next closest apple is at (2,6) or (4,4).\n- Moving LEFT to (6,5) brings me closer to the center and the apple at (4,4), and also avoids the immediate area where Snake #0 is operating.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,5) moves me towards the edge, which has less flexibility.\n\nGiven that Snake #0 is about to eat the apple at (6,7), it is better to avoid that area to prevent a potential conflict next turn. Instead, I should move towards the center and the apple at (4,4).\n\n**Best Move: LEFT to (6,5)**\nThis move is safe, improves my central position, and sets me up to go towards (4,4) or (2,6) in future turns. It avoids the risky zone near Snake #0.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (6,5), consider moving DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5) to approach the apple at (4,4). Monitor Snake #0's position\u2014it will be at (6,7) after eating, so it may move towards the center or other apples.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Eliminated.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Apple and Enemy Analysis:**\n- Closest apples: (4,4) and (5,1) are relatively close.\n- Snake #0 is at (6,7). It likely ate the apple at (6,7) last turn (since it was adjacent and we predicted it would move down). Now it has grown, so its body is longer. Its head is at (6,7), and it can move to (6,6), (5,7), (6,8) (its own body), or (7,7). It will probably avoid (6,8) (body) and (7,7) (off-board? Actually (7,7) is valid). But note: (6,6) is a potential conflict point if I move UP.\n\n**Risk of Head-on Collision:**\n- If I move UP to (6,6), Snake #0 might also move to (6,6) (if it chooses DOWN). This would cause a head-on collision and both die. Since Snake #0 has fewer apples (4 vs my 5), this would be bad for me (I lose because I die, and opponent might win if I die and it survives? Actually, both die so game ends and I have more apples so I win? But wait: rules say if all snakes die, the one with more apples wins. So if both die, I win because 5 > 4. However, if Snake #0 moves to (6,6) and I do, we both die and I win. But if Snake #0 moves elsewhere and I move to (6,6), I am safe.\n- However, I cannot predict Snake #0's move exactly. It might avoid (6,6) because it sees my head at (6,5) and doesn't want to risk collision? Or it might go for (5,7) or (7,7). So moving UP is risky but not certainly fatal.\n\n**Better to avoid risk:**\n- Moving DOWN to (6,4) is safe and moves me towards the apple at (4,4) or (5,1).\n- Moving LEFT to (5,5) is safe and also moves me towards (4,4).\n\n**Future Mobility:**\n- (6,4) has neighbors: (6,3), (6,5), (5,4), (7,4). (7,4) is my body, so only three safe options initially.\n- (5,5) has neighbors: (5,4), (5,6), (4,5), (6,5). All currently empty.\n- (6,6) has neighbors: (6,5), (6,7), (5,6), (7,6). (6,7) is Snake #0 head, so potentially dangerous next turn.\n\nSo DOWN and LEFT offer good mobility and avoid immediate danger.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI should prioritize getting the apple at (4,4). Moving LEFT to (5,5) is a direct step towards it. Moving DOWN to (6,4) is also good but slightly less direct.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (5,1) is below, but (4,4) is more valuable in the short term.\n\n**Best Move: LEFT to (5,5)**\nThis minimizes risk of collision with Snake #0, moves directly towards the apple at (4,4), and maintains good mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (5,5), consider moving DOWN to (5,4) or LEFT to (4,5) to approach (4,4). Avoid moving UP to (5,6) if Snake #0 is still nearby. Monitor Snake #0's position\u2014it may be moving towards other apples like (2,6) or (1,8).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

It sets me up to have good options next turn (LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or DOWN to (4,3)).\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating the apple, assess the board. Consider heading DOWN towards (5,1) or LEFT towards (2,6). Avoid moving UP into my own body. Monitor Snake #0's position to avoid head-on collisions.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Both DOWN and RIGHT lead towards it. However, moving DOWN (to (4,2)) is better because:\n- From (4,2), I can go RIGHT to (5,2) and then DOWN to (5,1). This path is direct and safe.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,3) would require going DOWN to (5,2) next, which is the same number of moves but leaves me with slightly fewer options (e.g., if I need to avoid something).\n- Moving LEFT towards (2,4) or (2,6) is riskier due to Snake #0 being in that area and possibly competing for the same apples.\n\n**Best Move: DOWN to (4,2)**\nThis is the safest and most efficient step towards the apple at (5,1). It avoids any potential conflict with Snake #0 and maintains good future mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (4,2), move RIGHT to (5,2) to get directly above the apple at (5,1).

All three are currently empty. Excellent mobility.\n*   **DOWN (to (4,1)):** From here, potential moves are LEFT (3,1), RIGHT (5,1). UP (4,2) will be my current head position, which will be my new body segment next turn, making it deadly. So only 2 safe moves next turn. Less mobile.\n*   **LEFT (to (3,2)):** From here, potential moves are UP (3,3), LEFT (2,2), DOWN (3,1). All three are currently empty. Good mobility, but direction is less optimal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRIGHT to (5,2) is the best move. It directly positions me above the apple at (5,1), maximizes my future options (3 safe moves next turn), and avoids moving towards the enemy.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5,2), move DOWN to (5,1) to eat the apple, unless the enemy snake moves into a threatening position. Monitor Snake #0's movement towards the apple at (2,4) or (2,6).\n\nRIGHT",

Consider Enemy Snake #0's possible moves from (2,5):**\nIts possible head positions next turn are (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), (3,5).\n*   (2,6) is its own body, so deadly for it.\n*   (2,4) is an apple.\n*   (1,5) and (3,5) are empty.\nThe enemy is likely to target the apple at (2,4) (DOWN from its current position). This does not directly threaten my safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n\n**3. Path to Apples and Strategy:**\nThe apple at (5,1) is directly below me. Eating it is the primary objective.\n*   **DOWN** is the direct move to get the apple.\n*   After eating, my head will be at (5,1), and my tail will still be at (6,5), giving me plenty of room to maneuver.\n\n**4. Future Mobility and Safety:**\n*   **DOWN (to (5,1)):** Eating the apple. After eating, the board changes. My new head is at (5,1), my new body is [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]. From (5,1), potential moves next turn are UP (back to (5,2) - which will be my body, so deadly), LEFT (4,1), RIGHT (6,1). I will have 2 safe moves. Slightly less mobile, but this is the cost of eating an apple and growing.\n*   **UP (to (5,3)):** From here, potential moves are UP (5,4), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3). All three are currently empty. Good mobility, but it moves me away from the immediate apple.\n*   **RIGHT (to (6,2)):** From here, potential moves are UP (6,3), DOWN (6,1), RIGHT (7,2). All three are currently empty. Good mobility, but also moves me away from the immediate apple.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move is **DOWN**. It secures an apple, increases my score to 7 (vs enemy's 5), and is safe. While it reduces my immediate mobility next turn, the gain of an apple and the lead in the game is worth it. The enemy is occupied with its own apple at (2,4), so this is a safe time to collect the one near me.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5,1), my only safe moves will likely be LEFT (4,1) and RIGHT (6,1). I should choose the one that positions me better for the apples at (0,2) or (9,2), preferably moving away from the enemy's likely new position near (2,4).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n*   **RIGHT:** (6, 1) - Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Enemy Snake #0's position and threat:**\nEnemy head is at (2,4), which is an apple. It likely just ate that apple, so it will grow. Its new head position is (2,4) and its tail segment will remain, making it 7 segments long. Its body now blocks many cells around it.\nFrom (2,4), its possible next moves are UP (2,5 - its own body, deadly), DOWN (2,3), LEFT (1,4), RIGHT (3,4). It is essentially trapped on its next turn with only 2 safe moves (DOWN and LEFT), unless it can move RIGHT into (3,4).\nThe enemy is currently far away from me and poses no immediate threat this turn.\n\n**3. Path to Apples and Strategy:**\nThe immediate goal is to survive the growth phase and position myself for the remaining apples at (1,8), (0,2), (9,2), (9,0), (2,8).\n*   **LEFT (to (4,1)):** Moves me towards the apple cluster at (0,2). It gives me a clear path up the left side.\n*   **RIGHT (to (6,1)):** Moves me towards the right-side apples at (9,2) and (9,0).\n*   **DOWN (to (5,0)):** Moves me to the bottom edge. This is safer from the enemy but moves me away from the apples, which are mostly at the top (y=8) and middle-top (y=2).\n\n**4. Future Mobility:**\n*   **LEFT (to (4,1)):** From here, next moves could be DOWN (4,0), LEFT (3,1), UP (4,2) - but (4,2) is my body. So 2 safe moves.\n*   **RIGHT (to (6,1)):** From here, next moves could be DOWN (6,0), RIGHT (7,1), UP (6,2). All three seem empty. Excellent mobility (3 safe moves).\n*   **DOWN (to (5,0)):** From here, next moves could be LEFT (4,0), RIGHT (6,0). UP (5,1) is the tail, but next turn the tail will move? After moving, my tail end is at (6,5). The tail only moves forward if I *don't* eat an apple. Since I just ate an apple last turn, my tail *stays* this turn. This means (5,1) will remain occupied by my body next turn. So from (5,0), UP is deadly. This leaves only LEFT and RIGHT. Poor mobility (2 safe moves, and trapped on the bottom edge).\n\n**Conclusion and Plan:**\n**RIGHT** is the strongest move. It provides the best immediate mobility for the next turn, steering me clear of my own long body, and starts moving me towards the apples on the right side of the board (9,2) and (9,0). The enemy is currently contained on the left side, so heading right is a good strategic choice to avoid conflict and collect apples safely.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (6,1), I will have open paths. I should continue moving right or up to approach (9,2), while carefully monitoring the enemy's movement from its constrained position at (2,4).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

My body: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] (8 segments).\nApples: (1,8), (0,2), (9,2), (9,0), (2,8).\nEnemy Snake #0: Head at (1,4), Body: [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7)].\nThe enemy just ate the apple at (1,4)? The board shows '0' at (1,4) and an apple at (0,2). The enemy head is now at (1,4) and it has grown to 7 segments. Its body blocks the area.\n\n**1. Check Immediate Dangers for each move from (6,1):**\n*   **UP:** (6,2) - Empty. Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (6,0) - Empty. Safe.\n*   **LEFT:** (5,1) - This is my own body (second segment). **DEADLY.**\n*   **RIGHT:** (7,1) - Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Enemy Snake #0's position and threat:**\nEnemy head is at (1,4). Its possible moves are UP (1,5), DOWN (1,3), LEFT (0,4), RIGHT (2,4 - its own body). So it has 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. It is not an immediate threat to my position at (6,1). It is more likely to move towards the apples on the left side (0,2) or (1,8).\n\n**3. Path to Apples and Strategy:**\nApples are at (1,8), (0,2), (9,2), (9,0), (2,8). Moving RIGHT or UP positions me better for the right-side apples (9,2) and (9,0). Moving DOWN leads to the bottom edge, which has an apple at (9,0) but is a longer path. Moving UP is the most direct path towards the top apples (1,8) and (2,8), but this also brings me closer to the enemy's territory.\n\n**4. Future Mobility:**\n*   **UP (to (6,2)):** From here, next moves could be UP (6,3), RIGHT (7,2), LEFT (5,2) - but (5,2) is my body. So 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT). Good.\n*   **RIGHT (to (7,1)):** From here, next moves could be UP (7,2), RIGHT (8,1), DOWN (7,0). All three seem empty. Excellent mobility (3 safe moves).\n*   **DOWN (to (6,0)):** From here, next moves could be LEFT (5,0), RIGHT (7,0). UP (6,1) will be my body next turn? After moving, my tail end is at (5,5). The tail only moves if I don't eat an apple. Since I didn't eat an apple this turn, my tail *will* move next turn, freeing up (5,5). However, (5,1) is my body and will remain. So (6,1) is still occupied. Therefore, from (6,0), UP is deadly. This leaves only LEFT and RIGHT. Poor mobility (2 safe moves, trapped on the bottom edge).\n\n**Conclusion and Plan:**\n**RIGHT** is the strongest move. It provides the best immediate mobility for the next turn, steering me clear of my own body and the bottom edge trap. It continues the strategic path towards the right-side apples (9,2) and (9,0), which are currently uncontested by the enemy. The enemy is likely to move left/up, so heading right avoids conflict.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (7,1), I will have excellent options to go UP, RIGHT, or DOWN. I should continue moving right (to (8,1)) or up (to (7,2)) to approach the apple at (9,2) efficiently.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Its possible moves are UP (0,3), DOWN (0,1), RIGHT (1,2 - its own body). It has 2 safe moves: UP and DOWN. It is not an immediate threat to my position on the right side of the board.\n\n**3. Path to Apples and Strategy:**\nThe apple at (9,2) is directly adjacent to my head. Moving **RIGHT** to (9,2) is the optimal move to claim it immediately. This will extend my length and score a point, tying the enemy at 8 apples each. The other apples are distant and not a priority over this immediate gain.\n\n**4. Future Mobility after each move:**\n*   **RIGHT (to (9,2)):** Eating the apple. My new head will be at (9,2). From there, next moves could be DOWN (9,1), LEFT (8,2 - my new body), UP (9,3). This leaves 2 safe moves (DOWN, UP). Good mobility.\n*   **UP (to (8,3)):** This moves away from the closest apple. From (8,3), next moves could be UP (8,4), RIGHT (9,3), LEFT (7,3). All seem empty. Excellent mobility (3 options) but delays eating.\n*   **LEFT (to (7,2)):** This also moves away from the apples. From (7,2), next moves could be UP (7,3), DOWN (7,1 - my body), LEFT (6,2). This leaves 2 safe moves. Decent mobility but poor strategic choice.\n\n**Conclusion and Plan:**\n**RIGHT** is the best move. It secures an apple, ties the score, and maintains good future mobility. The enemy is occupied on the left and poses no threat this turn. The plan is to eat the apple at (9,2) and then reassess. Options next turn will likely be UP or DOWN to continue collecting the remaining apples on the right side (9,0) and to avoid boxing myself into the corner.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

It is moving away from me on the far left side of the board and is not an immediate threat.\n\n**3. Path to Apples and Strategy:**\nI am now in the top-right corner (9,2). The only safe moves are UP and DOWN. My short-term goal is to exit this corner safely and target the nearest apples: (9,0) is below me, and (4,7) and (2,8) are to the left and up.\n*   **DOWN (to (9,1)):** Puts me one step closer to the apple at (9,0). This is a productive move toward a clear objective.\n*   **UP (to (9,3)):** Moves me further into the top row, away from the closest apple and deeper into the corner. From (9,3), my only safe moves would be LEFT or DOWN (DOWN would go to (9,2), which will be my new body next turn). This is a risky choice that severely limits my future options.\n\n**4. Future Mobility:**\n*   **DOWN (to (9,1)):** From here, I can move DOWN again to (9,0) to get the apple, or LEFT to (8,1) (which is my body *next* turn, so it will be safe to move into the space my tail just left) to start exiting the right side. This keeps 2-3 safe moves open next turn (DOWN to apple, LEFT to escape).\n*   **UP (to (9,3)):** From (9,3), the board is open to the left, but DOWN will lead back to (9,2) which will be my body. This essentially traps me with only LEFT as a viable escape route next turn, making my position very precarious.\n\n**Conclusion and Plan:**\n**DOWN** is the best move. It directly progresses toward the apple at (9,0) and provides better future mobility options to escape the corner afterwards. Moving UP is a trap that will likely lead to being boxed in. The plan is to go DOWN to (9,1), then next turn decide: if safe, go DOWN again to (9,0) to collect the apple, or if that looks risky for any reason, go LEFT to (8,1) to begin maneuvering toward the center and the other apples.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n*   **UP (6,1):** This is the cell my tail currently occupies. The tail will move away from this cell on the next turn, making it permanently safe. This move turns me upwards, which is the direction I need to go to eventually reach the apples. From (6,1), my next moves could be UP (6,2), LEFT (5,1), or RIGHT (7,1). (5,1) is currently my 9th segment, but it will also move forward. This path opens up the board and gives me more options.\n*   **LEFT (5,0):** This continues moving left along the bottom edge. While safe, it keeps me trapped on the very edge of the board with limited future options. From (5,0), my only safe move next turn would likely be UP (5,1), as DOWN is off-board and LEFT (4,0) might be risky depending on enemy movement. This path is less flexible and delays my progress towards the center and the apples.\n\n**3. Enemy Snake #0's position and threat:**\nEnemy head is at (2,4).

Its only safe moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. It is likely moving towards the apples in the top-left quadrant.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan and Strategy:**\nMy priority is to escape the bottom edge and navigate towards the apples. Moving **UP** is the strategically superior choice. It immediately begins the ascent and provides better future mobility. Continuing left keeps me confined and offers no advantage. The apple at (8,9) is a long-term goal, but the ones at (1,8), (2,8), and (1,6) are more relevant for the enemy. My immediate goal is to safely maneuver my long body into a more open area of the board.\n\n**Chosen Move:** UP\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

It doesn't significantly advance me towards any apples.\n*   **RIGHT (7,1):** This moves me right. Similar to LEFT, it keeps me low. My own body occupies much of the right side (columns 7-9), so moving right risks boxing myself in against my own body in future turns. It is less strategic than moving up.\n\n**3.

Long-term Plan and Strategy:**\nMy primary goal is to navigate my long body safely into the open upper half of the board. The apple at (4,7) is a viable medium-term target. Moving **UP** is the most direct and effective way to achieve this. I should continue moving upwards for the next few turns to establish a stronger position away from the edges and my own coiled body. I must remain aware of the enemy's path to the apples at (1,6) and (1,8) to avoid potential conflicts, but we are currently far apart.\n\n**Chosen Move:** UP\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Enemy Snake #0's position and threat:**\nEnemy head is at (1,8). It is likely on the apple at (2,8) or (1,8) itself. Its possible moves from (1,8) are UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7 - its own body), LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8 - apple). Its safe moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. It poses no immediate threat to me at (6,5). We are far apart.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan and Strategy:**\nMy plan is working. I am successfully moving my long body into the open upper half of the board. The apples at (6,9) and (4,7) are my primary targets. I should continue prioritizing upward movement to secure these apples. Avoiding the right side (columns 7-9) is crucial to prevent getting trapped by my own coils. The enemy is focused on the top-left apples, so the path to my targets is clear. My next move should continue this upward push.\n\n**Chosen Move:** UP\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n*   **UP (6,9):** This captures the apple, gains a point, and grows my snake. This is the optimal move as it directly achieves a primary objective.\n*   **LEFT (5,8):** This moves me towards the apple at (4,7) but is one step further away from it than the move from my previous head position.\n*   **RIGHT (7,8):** This moves me towards the right side. While safe this turn, it is a detour from the apples and moves me closer to my own body which is on the west and south edges, increasing the long-term risk of getting trapped.\n\n**3. Enemy Snake #0's position and threat:**\nEnemy head is at (3,7). Its possible moves are UP (3,8 - empty), DOWN (3,6 - empty), LEFT (2,7 - its own body), RIGHT (4,7 - contains an apple). It will likely not move into its own body (LEFT). It could move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT towards the apple at (4,7). It is at least 2-3 moves away from my current position and poses no immediate threat to my head.\n\n**4. Plan and Strategy:**\nThe plan is successful. Capturing the apple at (6,9) is the highest priority and most efficient action this turn. My tail is at (7,0), so my body will soon start to shift, providing more room for maneuver on the right side of the board. After this apple, the next priority is (4,7).\n\n**Chosen Move:** UP\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

The cell (8,7) is safe to enter.\n*   **LEFT (7,8):** This move does not eat an apple. It moves me away from the immediate food source and towards the center of the board. While safe, it is less advantageous than the move that directly secures a point.\n\n**3. Strategic considerations and plan:**\n*   The primary goal is to collect apples to catch up to and surpass the enemy's score. The apple at (8,7) is directly reachable and should be prioritized.\n*   Moving DOWN to eat the apple is the clear best choice. It immediately improves my position in the score race.\n*   After eating the apple at (8,7), my head will be at (8,7). Next turn, my options from there will need to be evaluated, but they will likely include LEFT (7,7), DOWN (8,6), and possibly RIGHT (9,7) (off-board, so deadly). The area to the left and down appears open. My long body along x=6 is a constraint, so moving west/south is the logical path to avoid self-collision and explore for more apples (e.g., (5,2) and (3,1) are south-west).\n*   The enemy snake is distant and not an immediate threat. Its head is at (4,4), and it is moving in a pattern that seems confined to the left side of the board. We are not on a collision course.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **DOWN** (to (8,7)) to eat the apple.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Immediate dangers for each move from (8,7):**\n*   **UP (8,8):** Own body (second segment) \u2192 **DEADLY**\n*   **DOWN (8,6):** Empty \u2192 **SAFE**\n*   **LEFT (7,7):** Empty \u2192 **SAFE**\n*   **RIGHT (9,7):** Off the board \u2192 **DEADLY**\n\n**Conclusion:** **DOWN** and **LEFT** are safe.\n\n**2. Evaluation of safe moves:**\n*   **DOWN (8,6):** This move moves me south, away from the top edge and towards the center of the board. This area is relatively open and leads towards apples at (5,2) and (3,1). It provides good future options (e.g., LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT).\n*   **LEFT (7,7):** This move moves me west. This is also a safe move, but it brings me closer to my own long body which runs along x=6 from y=1 to y=9. This could potentially limit my future maneuverability. The apple at (3,9) is far and requires navigating around my own body.\n\n**3. Strategic considerations and plan:**\n*   The primary goal is to collect apples safely. The enemy snake (head at (4,3)) is also 12 apples, so the race is tied. I need to secure the next apple to gain an advantage.\n*   The closest apples are (5,2) and (3,1). Moving DOWN is the most direct path towards these apples. Moving LEFT is less direct and risks getting constrained by my own body.\n*   My long body is a significant obstacle. Moving south (DOWN) creates more space between my head and my body, reducing the risk of self-collision in future moves.\n*   The enemy snake is on the left side of the board and does not pose an immediate threat. Its path seems to be circling, but it is not currently heading towards the apples I am targeting.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **DOWN** (to (8,6)). This is the safest and most strategic move, opening a clear path towards the southern apples and avoiding potential traps near my own body.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Evaluation of safe moves:**\n*   **DOWN (8,4):** This move continues south. It moves me further away from my long body on the right side and towards the apple at (3,1). This direction opens up a large, safe area of the board (y<5). The enemy snake is also in this general area (head at (5,2)), so I must be cautious of potential head-on collisions or being cut off. However, the immediate path is clear.\n*   **LEFT (7,5):** This move moves me west. It brings me closer to my own body which occupies the x=6 column. This significantly limits my future options and risks boxing me in. The apples in this direction ((3,9), (2,9)) are far and would require navigating a tight space near my body and the enemy's body. This move feels constricting.\n\n**3. Strategic considerations and plan:**\n*   The enemy now has 13 apples (I have 12). Securing an apple is my top priority to regain the lead. The apple at (3,1) is the closest and most reachable target.\n*   Moving DOWN is the most direct path towards (3,1). It keeps me in open space, maximizing my future maneuverability and escape routes.\n*   I must anticipate the enemy's move from (5,2). They are likely to also move towards the (3,1) apple or the (0,6) apple. Their possible moves from (5,2) are UP (5,3 - their own body), DOWN (5,1 - empty), LEFT (4,2 - their own body), RIGHT (6,2 - empty). So they can likely only move DOWN or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT (6,2) would put them directly between me and the (3,1) apple, potentially blocking me. Moving DOWN (5,1) would also aim for the apple. My move DOWN (8,4) is a strong, safe step in this race.\n*   My long body is a liability. Staying in the southern, emptier part of the board is the best strategy to avoid it.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **DOWN** (to (8,4)). This is the safest and most strategic move, directly progressing towards the southern apple at (3,1) while keeping my options open and maintaining a safe distance from my own body.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Evaluation of safe moves:**\n*   **DOWN (8,2):** This continues my aggressive southward push toward the apple at (3,1). This is the most direct route. The enemy's head is at (4,1), so we are converging. Their possible moves from (4,1) are UP (4,2 - their own body), DOWN (4,0 - empty), LEFT (3,1 - apple cell), RIGHT (5,1 - their own body). They have two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. If they go LEFT, they will eat the apple (3,1) this turn. Moving DOWN keeps me on a path to potentially intercept or contest the area if they don't take it.\n*   **LEFT (7,3):** This move moves me west, away from the board edge. However, it moves me closer to my own long body which occupies the x=6 column. This significantly limits my future options and risks boxing me in. The apple at (3,1) is now to the south-west, making LEFT a less direct path. This move feels constricting and reactive.\n\n**3. Strategic considerations and plan:**\n*   The enemy is poised to take the (3,1) apple this turn if they choose LEFT. My priority must shift to securing an alternative apple if that happens. The apples at (0,6) and (0,9) are now more relevant. A long-term plan to loop around the bottom and left edges of the board is forming.\n*   However, moving DOWN is still the correct aggressive play. If the enemy does NOT take the apple (perhaps they go DOWN to (4,0)), then I am in a strong position to claim it soon. Moving DOWN also keeps me in the open, southern area, which is safer given my long body.\n*   Moving LEFT feels like conceding the race and entering a more dangerous, cluttered part of the board.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **DOWN** (to (8,2)). I am committing to the southern strategy. If the apple at (3,1) is taken this turn, my new target will be (0,6), requiring a subsequent leftward movement. Moving DOWN maintains my options and keeps me in the safest available space.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Evaluation of safe moves:**\n*   **DOWN (8,1):** Continues my southward movement. This is a safe, open space. It moves me further from the apples on the top row (y=9) but keeps me in a position to potentially target the apple at (0,6) or loop around the bottom of the board. The enemy is currently far away in the northwest quadrant.\n*   **LEFT (7,2):** Moves me west. This is also a safe move. It brings me slightly closer to the apple at (0,6) and the cluster of apples at (0,9), (2,9), (3,9). However, it also moves me closer to my own body which occupies the x=6 column, potentially limiting future movement options.\n\n**3. Strategic considerations and plan:**\nThe enemy snake (#0) has just eaten the apple at (3,1) (their head was on it last turn, and their body length increased by 1). Their new head position confirms this. My previous target is gone.\n\n**New Primary Target:** The apple at (0,6). It is the closest and most accessible apple now. The apples at (0,9), (2,9), (3,9) are also valuable but require navigating the crowded top row where my own body and the enemy's body are present. (5,8) is also an option but is closer to the enemy's territory.\n\n**Path to (0,6):** The most efficient path is to move west along the bottom of the board. Moving **DOWN** to (8,1) is a good first step to get to the southern edge (y=0 or y=1). From there, I can turn LEFT and move horizontally with minimal risk of self-collision. Moving LEFT now would put me at (7,2), which is not as direct a route to the southern corridor.\n\n**Future Safety:** Moving DOWN keeps me in the wide-open southern area, maximizing my future move options. Moving LEFT brings me into a slightly more constrained space near my own body.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **DOWN** (to (8,1)). This is the best move to initiate a long-term path toward the apple at (0,6) while maintaining the highest degree of safety and flexibility for subsequent moves.

It continues my southern strategy, opening up future moves LEFT or RIGHT along the bottom row. The apple at (0,6) is still my primary target, and this move gets me closer to the y-axis from which I can approach it.\n*   **LEFT (7,1):** Moves me west. This is also safe. It brings me slightly closer to the enemy snake's head at (2,1). While a collision isn't imminent, it reduces our buffer zone. It also moves me into a column (x=7) that is adjacent to my own body segments, potentially limiting future movement options more than moving to the open bottom row.\n\n**3. Strategic considerations and plan:**\nMy long-term plan remains to secure the apple at (0,6). The safest and most efficient path is to continue moving south to the bottom row (y=0) and then travel west along it. This path is wide open and minimizes the risk of self-collision or conflict with the enemy, who is currently positioned further north.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (8,0) is the optimal choice to execute this plan. It maximizes my future options\u2014from (8,0), I can go LEFT to (7,0) or RIGHT to (9,0) (but RIGHT is off-board, so only LEFT is viable, which is fine as it's the direction I need to go). Moving LEFT now to (7,1) is less direct for this plan and brings me marginally closer to the enemy for no significant benefit.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **DOWN** (to (8,0)). This solidifies my position on the southern edge, providing maximum safety and aligning perfectly with my strategy to loop around the bottom of the board toward the apple at (0,6).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

This move is safe but less efficient.\n\n**3. Strategic considerations and long-term plan:**\nMy long-term goal is to efficiently collect the apple at (0,6). Moving LEFT is the optimal choice for this. The enemy snake is far away in the top-left quadrant and poses no immediate threat to this plan. The enemy has a 2-apple lead (14 vs my 12), so I must be decisive and efficient in my pathing. Moving LEFT gets me closer to my target with minimal risk. Moving UP offers no significant advantage and would delay my progress.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving LEFT along the bottom edge (y=0) toward (0,6). This is the safest and most direct route. Once I reach the left side, I can move up to secure the apple. I should remain aware of the enemy's position but it is currently distant.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **LEFT** (to (5,0)). This is the safest and most strategic move, directly advancing me toward my goal.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Once I reach the left wall, I will need to move UP to get the apple at (0,6). I must remain vigilant for any changes in the enemy's position, but it is currently distant and not an immediate threat to this plan. The enemy's 2-apple lead (14 vs my 12) means I must be efficient.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving LEFT to (4,0), then (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), and finally (0,0).

Strategic considerations and long-term plan:**\nMy plan remains unchanged: continue moving LEFT along the bottom edge (y=0) to reach (0,0). The enemy's body forms a wall from (2,1) to (5,1), effectively blocking access to the lower rows from the north. This makes my current path along the very bottom the most secure. Once I reach the left wall, I will need to move UP to get the apple at (0,6). I must remain vigilant for any changes in the enemy's position, but it is currently distant and not an immediate threat to this plan. The enemy's 3-apple lead (15 vs my 12) means I must be efficient.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving LEFT to (1,0), and finally (0,0). From (0,0), I will move UP to (0,1) and continue north to reach the apple at (0,6). This is the safest and most direct route available.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **LEFT** (to (1,0)). This is the only safe move and aligns perfectly with my strategic objective.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

It is currently blocking the apple at (0,9) and is near (1,8) and (2,9). Moving UP brings me closer to this confrontation zone. Moving RIGHT to (1,1) is also safe but deviates from my efficient path toward the apples at the top. The enemy has a 4-apple lead (16 vs my 12), so I must prioritize reaching apples quickly. The path along x=0 is clear from y=2 to y=5, providing a safe corridor. Moving RIGHT would put me in a more open area but also closer to the enemy's body segments (e.g., at (2,1), (3,1)), increasing future risk without a clear short-term apple gain. The apple at (1,3) is below and would require moving DOWN later, which is less efficient. Therefore, continuing UP is the stronger strategic choice to maintain my course toward the high-value apples at the top-left.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving UP along the left wall (x=0) toward the apples. Be prepared for a potential encounter with the enemy snake near y=8 or y=9. Avoid moving right into the center unless the left path becomes blocked or a safer opportunity arises.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **UP** (to (0,2)). This maintains my strategic course and is the most direct route to the apples.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Strategic considerations:**\nMy plan to ascend the left wall is progressing. Moving UP to (0,4) continues this direct path toward the cluster of apples at the top (y=8 and y=9). The enemy snake's head is at (2,9), near apples (3,9) and (1,8). It has a 5-apple lead (17 vs my 12), so I must prioritize efficient apple collection. Moving RIGHT to (1,3) would immediately collect the apple there, gaining a point and growing. However, this move deviates from my efficient vertical path and places me at (1,3), which is adjacent to the enemy's body segments at (2,3) and (2,2). This increases future risk and could lead to a dead-end. The path along x=0 from y=4 to y=5 is clear and safe, providing a corridor to higher-value apples. The immediate gain from the apple at (1,3) is tempting, but the long-term strategic advantage lies in staying on the less contested left edge to reach the multiple apples at the top. The enemy is large and may be constrained by its own body, reducing its mobility near the top-left corner.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving UP along the left wall (x=0). The next moves would be to (0,4), (0,5), etc. This path is predictable but currently the safest and most direct route to the high-value targets. Be prepared to potentially turn right toward the apples at y=8 or y=9 once I am higher up the board, assessing the enemy's position at that time.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **UP** (to (0,4)). This maintains my strategic course, avoids moving into more contested territory prematurely, and is the most direct route to the apples.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Moving RIGHT to (1,4) deviates from this plan. While it doesn't immediately put me in danger, it places me closer to the enemy's extensive body network on the right (e.g., (2,3), (2,4)), potentially limiting my future options and increasing the risk of an encounter. The enemy has a significant lead (18 vs my 12), so I must prioritize efficient, safe collection. The apple at (1,3) is still available, but it is now behind me and guarded by enemy body segments. Continuing my vertical ascent is the most predictable and lowest-risk strategy to close the gap. Once I reach a higher y-coordinate (y=7 or y=8), I can reassess and potentially turn right to target the apples if the enemy has moved away.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving UP along the left wall to (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). This is the safest corridor. Monitor the enemy's head position at (3,9) to anticipate if it will move away from the top-left apples, creating an opportunity for me to claim them.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **UP** (to (0,5)).

Strategic considerations:**\nMy previous plan to ascend the left wall is now blocked by the enemy's body at (0,6). Moving RIGHT to (1,5) is my only viable option. This move opens up several future possibilities:\n- I can potentially turn UP to (1,6) to pursue the apple at (1,8), but I must be cautious as the enemy's head is at (4,9) and could move into that area.\n- I can turn RIGHT again to (2,5) to approach the center of the board, but note the enemy's body segment is at (2,5), so that cell will be dangerous next turn unless the enemy moves it.\n- I can turn DOWN to (1,4) to potentially target the apple at (1,3), which is still available.\n\nMy immediate priority is to survive this turn. The enemy has a significant lead (18 vs my 12), so I must play cautiously and look for opportunities to collect apples while avoiding conflict. The enemy's long body creates a complex obstacle course, but it also limits its own mobility. I should look for paths that lead to open areas and available apples, like (1,3) or (9,5)/(9,9), while carefully monitoring the enemy's head position to avoid a head-on collision.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** From (1,5), assess the safety of moving UP to (1,6) or DOWN to (1,4). The enemy body at (2,5) is a key danger to watch; if the enemy moves its head, that segment might vacate. Prioritize reaching the apple at (1,3) if the path is clear, as it is the closest and least contested target.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **RIGHT** (to (1,5)). This is the only safe move that keeps me alive.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

My primary goal should be to navigate the bottom-left quadrant safely and look for openings to reach other apples like (9,5) or (5,8) in the future.\n\nThis conservative approach minimizes risk and guarantees at least one apple in the immediate future.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **DOWN** (to (1,4)).

I must be cautious of the enemy's extensive body wall, but my immediate priority is to survive and collect the apple in front of me.\n\nThis conservative approach continues to minimize risk while guaranteeing an apple collection this turn.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **DOWN** (to (1,3)).

It keeps more open space for subsequent moves (the cell (2,8) will become reachable next turn).  \n  3.

Strategic considerations:**\nMy only safe move is DOWN to (1,1). This does not collect an apple. My tail has moved to (4,0), so my body will remain 14 segments long next turn.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\nMy head will be at (1,1). From there, I must assess my options:\n*   **DOWN (1,0):** This is my own body segment (1,0). However, my tail is at (4,0) and will move forward to (3,0) next turn. Therefore, the cell (1,0) will become empty and safe to move into *after* the next simultaneous move. **It is NOT safe to move into (1,0) on the *current* turn.** Moving DOWN to (1,0) now would be fatal.\n*   **RIGHT (2,1):** This cell is adjacent to the enemy body at (3,1) and (2,2). It is currently empty and could be a potential escape route if the enemy doesn't block it. However, I must be cautious of the enemy's next move.\n\nGiven that DOWN to (1,0) is fatal *this turn*, my only viable move next turn will likely be RIGHT to (2,1), provided it remains empty. My long-term goal is to navigate carefully towards the bottom-left area, potentially aiming for the apple at (6,0) by moving right along the bottom edge. I must avoid the enemy's massive body wall that dominates the left and center of the board. Survival is paramount; I will wait for the enemy to potentially make a mistake or create an opening.\n\n**Chosen Move:** **DOWN** (to (1,1)). This is the only safe move.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

This is a critical situation.\n\n**2. Re-evaluating the board state:**\nMy head is completely surrounded. However, I must consider the simultaneous movement of the enemy snake. The enemy head is at (2,8). If it moves away from (2,1), that cell might become free *after* the move. But according to the rules, I must check for collisions based on the state *before* the move. The cell (2,1) is currently occupied by the enemy's body, so moving RIGHT is fatal. The same applies to the other directions: they are all occupied by my own body.\n\n**3. Is there any hope?**\nThe only possibility for survival is if the enemy head moves into my body, causing it to die. Specifically, if the enemy moves LEFT from (2,8) to (1,8), it would hit my body segment at (1,8) (which is part of its own body wall, but wait\u2014let's check the board state). The board shows 'T' at (1,8), which is my tail from a previous state? Actually, looking at the provided board ASCII:\nRow 8: \"8 T A 0 T T T . . . .\"\nThis means (1,8) is an apple 'A', not a snake segment. So (1,8) is empty. Therefore, the enemy can safely move LEFT to (1,8).\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves DOWN to (2,7), it would be safe. So it is unlikely that the enemy will kill itself this turn.\n\nGiven that all four moves from my head are into occupied cells, I have no safe move. This means I am doomed to die this turn regardless of my choice.\n\n**4. Choosing a move:**\nSince all moves lead to death, I will choose DOWN to (1,0) to at least die moving towards the bottom-left, which was my previous plan.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",
