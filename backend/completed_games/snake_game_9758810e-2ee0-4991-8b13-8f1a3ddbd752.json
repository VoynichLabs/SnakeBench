Let's map this out.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (10x10):**\n- **Apple Drops:** (0,2), (7,2), (3,0), (2,8), (0,3), (0,9), (9,0), (1,7), (8,1), (3,9), (6,5), (9,3), (5,0), (9,2), (8,2)\n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (4,8), Body: none. Score: 0.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (2,4), Body: none. Score: 0.\n\n**STRATEGY:** My main rival is at (2,4). I'm at (4,8). I have a clear vertical advantage, but I need to close the distance. The apple at (2,8) is directly above the enemy! That's a trap or a target. If I go UP to (4,9), I'm at the top border but not close to apples. If I go DOWN to (4,7), I move toward the center and line up with the apple at (6,5). If I go LEFT to (3,8), I head directly toward the apple cluster near (2,8) and (3,9). If I go RIGHT to (5,8), I head toward (6,5) but move away from the enemy.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** The enemy is at (2,4). They see apples at (2,8) (straight up), (3,9) (up-right), (1,7) (up-left), and (3,0) (down-right). They will likely chase the closest apples. If they go UP to (2,5), they are safe. If they go RIGHT to (3,4), they head toward (3,0) and (6,5). I need to anticipate their move. Since they are score 0, they will be aggressive for growth.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP: (4,9) - Valid (on board). No body collision.\n- DOWN: (4,7) - Valid. No body collision.\n- LEFT: (3,8) - Valid. No body collision.\n- RIGHT: (5,8) - Valid. No body collision.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing UP to (4,9) puts me on the top edge. That limits my future moves (can't go up again). Going LEFT to (3,8) moves me toward the high-value apple cluster at (2,8) and (3,9). This positions me to intercept the enemy if they chase the (2,8) apple. It also keeps me centered and away from the bottom wall. I want to control the board. The apple at (2,8) is suspiciously close to the enemy, but if I claim it, I grow and potentially block his path. I will choose LEFT.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move LEFT to (3,8) to position for the apples at (2,8) or (3,9). Watch the enemy at (2,4). If they move UP, I'm ready to pounce. If they move RIGHT, I'll adjust next turn. We are playing to dominate, not just survive.\n\nLEFT",

The board is loaded with apples, but I'm not gonna let those distract me\u2014I need to focus on boxing this archrival in!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My position:** (3,8) with no body. Safe.\n- **Enemy position:** (1,4) with no body. Safe.\n- **Danger zones:** The enemy is 4 cells away vertically and 2 cells away horizontally. We're not in immediate collision range.\n- **Apple trap:** There's an apple at (2,8) right above me. But if I go UP to (3,9), I'm on the top wall\u2014boxing myself in. If I go LEFT to (2,8), I eat that apple but move closer to the enemy's vertical path.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP: (3,9) - Valid, but top border limits future moves. No body collision.\n- DOWN: (3,7) - Valid, opens up the board. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,8) - Valid, moves toward enemy's vertical zone. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,8) - Valid, but moves away from the action. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:** I need to trap this snake! Going LEFT to (2,8) puts me on the same vertical line as the enemy (x=2) but way up high. If I eat that apple, I grow to size 1 and score 1 point. Then next turn, I can descend while the enemy might be climbing up\u2014potential head-on collision if I have the size advantage! But wait... if I go LEFT now, I'm at (2,8). The enemy at (1,4) could go UP to (1,5) or RIGHT to (2,4). If they go RIGHT to (2,4), we're on the same column but far apart. I could chase them down.\n\nAlternatively, DOWN to (3,7) gives me more maneuvering room and keeps me centered. But I want to be aggressive! Let's claim that apple and set up a blockade.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Go LEFT to eat (2,8), grow to size 1, then descend next turn to pressure the enemy's vertical space.

Back to where I was, but my tail (3,8) will move after this turn (since I grew last turn from eating apple at (2,8) - wait, no! I ate (2,8) on turn 1, so my body is now [(3,8)] and tail is (3,8). So RIGHT would be into my own body - DEAD! \u274c\n\n2. **Apple Situation:** I already ate (2,8) last turn! So my score is 1. Now at (2,8) with body [(3,8)]. The board has apples but I'm ignoring them - focus on the enemy at (0,4)!\n\n3. **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 at (0,4) with no body. They're on the left edge. They could go UP (0,5), DOWN (0,3), or RIGHT (1,4). They're trapped if I can push them up against the wall!\n\n4. **Strategy:** I want to trap the enemy. If I go LEFT to (1,8), I'm getting closer to their vertical column (x=0). Then I can descend and cut off their escape routes. The enemy is at y=4, I'm at y=8 - if I go DOWN next turn, I can block their access to the bottom!\n\n5. **Future Options:**\n   - LEFT to (1,8): Then I can go DOWN (1,7) \u2192 LEFT (0,7) \u2192 DOWN (0,6) \u2192 DOWN (0,5) \u2192 DOWN (0,4) to challenge them!\n   - DOWN to (2,7): Good central position, but slower to approach enemy.\n   - UP to (2,9): Dead end on top edge - avoid!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Go LEFT to (1,8), then descend while keeping an eye on enemy's vertical movement. If they go UP, I chase. If they go RIGHT, I can intercept. Force them into a corner! They're at (0,4) with no body - I can box them in on the left edge.\n\n**SAFETY:** LEFT is safe - no wall, no body collision (my tail moves after), enemy isn't there. Let's get aggressive! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

Apples are lurking all over, but we\u2019re laser-focused on the enemy and edge control. Let\u2019s box him in with smart growth.\n\nSafe moves right now from (0,4):\n- UP -> (0,5): safe, open, but not grabbing an apple this turn.\n- RIGHT -> (1,4): safe, stays mid-left and keeps options open.\n- DOWN -> (0,3): safe and, crucially, eats the apple at (0,3) to grow.\n- LEFT -> off-board (not allowed).\n\nWhy DOWN is the best play now:\n- It eats the apple on this turn, giving immediate content and longer survival.\n- It keeps us hugging the left edge, which is perfect for future cornering and setting traps.\n- It avoids any near-term head-on risk with the far-away opponent and doesn\u2019t trap us in a bottleneck.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN to (0,3) to grab that apple and grow.\n- From there, establish a left-edge corridor and threaten to constrict space toward the center, increasing chances for forced head-ons later when we have more apples and length.\n\nLonger-term strategy note:\n- Build a controlled edge blockade: snake along x=0 and y ranges that let us pivot into center only when the opponent is boxed or forced into a mistake.\n- Prioritize apples to outrun the opponent on length, then leverage head-on opportunities only when we have a superior length and can fork him into a trap.\n\nNext-turn behavior (quick mental map):\n- If we\u2019re at (0,3) after the move, assess whether to continue DOWN/UP along the edge or pivot along the left column to funnel him toward our future trap. Always keep a safe buffer from his head so a collision isn\u2019t accidental.\n\nDOWN",

If they go RIGHT into my path, I win the head-on collision since scores are equal (both 2). If they go UP, I chase. If they go DOWN, I corner them against the bottom wall.\n\n5. **Safety:** LEFT is safe - no wall, no my body, no enemy there yet. RIGHT is safest but puts me away from enemy. DOWN is good but LEFT gets me on their column faster. UP is IMPOSSIBLE (into myself!).\n\n**STRATEGY:** Go LEFT to (0,7) to get on the enemy's column! Then descend down to intercept.

The enemy is at (0,1) - still on the left wall! \ud83d\ude08 Let's analyze the battlefield!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1. **Safety Check - My possible moves from (0,7):**\n   - **UP:** (0,8) - **INVALID!** My own body is there! (Body: [(1,7), (1,8), (2,8)])\n   - **DOWN:** (0,6) - Valid! Moving down toward the enemy.\n   - **LEFT:** (-1,7) - **DEAD!** Off the board! Left wall at x=0.\n   - **RIGHT:** (1,7) - **INVALID!** My own body is there! (Body starts with (1,7))\n\n   **ONLY SAFE MOVE: DOWN to (0,6).**\n\n2. **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 is at (0,1) with body [(0,2), (0,3)]. They're stuck on the left wall! If they go DOWN, they hit (0,0) - dead end. If they go RIGHT, they head into the open. If they go UP, they climb toward me. I'm moving DOWN to (0,6) - I'm descending their column! They have nowhere to go but into my path!\n\n3. **Apple Strategy:** Ignoring apples (7,2), (3,0), etc. - I have 3 apples, they have 2. I'm ahead! Domination is key. The apple at (0,9) is above me but blocked by my own body.\n\n4. **Trap Plan:** I'm boxing them in against the left wall! From (0,6), I can continue DOWN to (0,5), (0,4), (0,3)... If they go RIGHT into (1,1) or (1,2), I'm setting up to cut them off. They're cornered! If they go UP into (0,2) or (0,3), I'll be descending to meet them. Head-on collision favors ME since I have more apples (3 vs 2)! If we collide, they die, I survive with my current length.\n\n5. **Safety:** DOWN is the ONLY legal move. It's safe - no wall, no my body, no enemy there yet. I'm forced into this move, but it's exactly what I want - to pressure them against the wall!\n\n**STRATEGY:** I'm forced DOWN to (0,6), but this is perfect! I'm descending their column, cutting off their escape. They're trapped between me, their own body, and the bottom wall. They have no good moves. Let's close the trap! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**SAFETY CHECK PASSED:** DOWN is the only move, and it's safe.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is at (1,1) with body [(0,1), (0,2)]. I'm 3 apples to their 2 - I'm winning! Let's plot the takedown. \ud83d\udc80\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **SAFETY CHECK from (0,6):**\n   - **UP:** (0,7) - **INVALID!** My own body (0,7) is there! Dead.\n   - **DOWN:** (0,5) - Valid? Check: Is (0,5) occupied? The board shows at y=5: row 5 is \" . . . . . . A . . .\" - (0,5) is empty! No body, no enemy. Safe!\n   - **LEFT:** (-1,6) - **DEAD!** Off board (x=0 is left wall).\n   - **RIGHT:** (1,6) - Valid? Board at (1,6) shows \".\" (empty). My body: (0,6) head, (0,7), (1,7), (1,8) - none at (1,6). Enemy body at (0,1),(0,2). So (1,6) is empty. Safe!\n\n   **SAFE MOVES: DOWN or RIGHT.**\n\n2. **ENEMY ANALYSIS:** Snake #0 at (1,1). They're still on the left wall area. Their possible moves: \n   - UP: (1,2) - empty? Board row 2: \"T . . . . . . A A A\" - (1,2) is empty (it's \"T\" at (2,2)? Wait no, row 2 columns: 0=T, 1=., 2=., 3=., 4=., 5=., 6=., 7=A, 8=A, 9=A. So (1,2) is empty. \n   - DOWN: (1,0) - board row 0: \" . . A A . A . . . A\" - (1,0) is empty (space between).\n   - LEFT: (0,1) - that's their own body! They'd die moving left into their own body at (0,1).\n   - RIGHT: (2,1) - board row 1: \"T 0 . . . . . . A .\" Wait, row 1 columns: 0=T, 1=0 (head at (1,1)), 2=., 3=., 4=., 5=., 6=., 7=., 8=A, 9=. So (2,1) is empty.\n\n   Enemy likely moves UP or RIGHT or DOWN. If they move UP to (1,2), they're getting closer to me (I'm at (0,6)). If they move RIGHT, they're going into center. If they move DOWN to (1,0), they're at bottom.\n\n   **CRITICAL:** If I go RIGHT to (1,6), and enemy goes UP to (1,2) or RIGHT to (2,1), no collision. But if I go DOWN to (0,5), enemy might go UP (1,2) - we're separating.\n\n3. **TRAP PLAN - FORCE HEAD-ON COLLISION:** I have 3 apples vs their 2. If we collide, I win! I need to chase them into a corner. They're at (1,1). If I go RIGHT to (1,6), I'm moving right into the board, potentially cutting them off from the right side. But they might go LEFT into (0,1) and die (into their own body). That's even better - they die without me doing anything!\n\n   Actually, wait: if they go LEFT into (0,1), that's their own body (first body segment after head). They die. So why chase? Let's see: if I stay on left column by going DOWN, I'm still in their column. They might go RIGHT to avoid dying, but if they go LEFT they die. So if I go DOWN, I'm pressuring them to move right. If I go RIGHT, I'm moving away, giving them room.\n\n   **DOMINATION STRATEGY:** I should go RIGHT to (1,6). Why? Because I'm already on the left wall (x=0). Going DOWN keeps me trapped on left edge with limited future moves (eventually dead end at bottom). Going RIGHT opens up the board, gives me more options to maneuver and eventually corner them from the right side. I have 3 apples - I'm winning! I can afford to be aggressive and spread out.\n\n   From (1,6), my next moves could be RIGHT, UP, DOWN - all open. From (0,5), only RIGHT is open (UP is my body, LEFT is wall, DOWN might be open but eventually wall). So RIGHT gives me more mobility to hunt them down.\n\n   Also, if I go RIGHT to (1,6), and they go RIGHT to (2,1), I'm setting up to potentially meet them in the center later. If they go UP to (1,2), I'm still in a good position to chase.\n\n   **SAFETY:** Both DOWN and RIGHT are safe. But RIGHT is strategically better for long-term hunting. I need to escape the left wall trap!\n\n4. **APPLE IGNORE:** Apples are all over, but I'm not rushing to them. My focus is enemy. However, if I go RIGHT to (1,6), I'm moving closer to apples at (8,6) and (7,4) later? Not directly, but it opens paths.\n\n5. **FINAL VERDICT:** Going RIGHT is the power move. It escapes the left wall trap, gives me more future options, and keeps me in position to chase the enemy. I have the apple lead - I can play aggressive! Let's dominate the center!\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:** From (1,6), I'll assess enemy position. If they're still near left, I can try to cut them off by moving toward their y-level (y=1) while staying right (x>0). Goal: force them into a corner or into a head-on collision where I win due to apple lead.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK PASSED:** Both moves safe, but RIGHT is the strategic play for domination.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's keep the pressure on!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**SAFETY CHECK from (1,6):**\n- **UP:** (1,7) - **DEAD!** My own body is there at (1,7) - it's my third segment.

Enemy body: (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) - none at (1,5). Safe!\n- **LEFT:** (0,6) - **DEAD!** My own body is there at (0,6) - second segment. Moving backwards into myself = death.\n- **RIGHT:** (2,6) - Valid? Board row 6: \"T 1 . . . . . . A .\" - (2,6) is empty (the \"1\" is me at (1,6), so column 2 is empty). My body: none at (2,6). Enemy body: none at (2,6). Safe!\n\n**SAFE MOVES: DOWN or RIGHT.**\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #0 at (2,1) with body [(1,1), (0,1)]. Their possible moves:\n- UP: (2,2) - board row 2: \"T . . . . . . A A A\" - (2,2) is empty (it's \"T\" at (0,2)? Wait, row 2 col 0 = T, col 1 = ., col 2 = ., etc. So (2,2) is empty).\n- DOWN: (2,0) - board row 0: \" . . A A . A . . . A\" - (2,0) is empty (column 2 has \"A\" but that's at (2,0)? Actually row 0: col 0=., col 1=., col 2=A, col 3=A, etc. So (2,0) has an APPLE! They might go for it.\n- LEFT: (1,1) - **THEIR OWN BODY!** They'd die moving into (1,1) - their first body segment. They won't do that unless forced.\n- RIGHT: (3,1) - board row 1: \"T 0 . . . . . . A .\" - (3,1) is empty.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**\nI have 3 apples vs their 2. If we collide, I win! But I need to be smart. I'm at (1,6), they're at (2,1). The board is 10x10 with apples scattered. I need to force them into a corner or create a head-on collision.\n\n**OPTION 1: GO RIGHT to (2,6)**\n- Why? This moves me into the center-right area, giving me more mobility. From (2,6), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all potentially open depending on body). I'm expanding my territory and cutting off the right side. The enemy is on the left side - I can chase them from the right!\n- Long-term: I can try to move toward y=1 (their level) while staying at x>=2, potentially forcing them left into their own body or into a wall.\n- Apple proximity: I'm moving closer to apples at (3,0), (5,0), (6,5), (7,4), (8,6) - all on the right side. Good for growth.\n\n**OPTION 2: GO DOWN to (1,5)**\n- This keeps me on the left side, but I'm already near the left wall. From (1,5), my options are more limited: UP blocked by my body, LEFT blocked by wall, DOWN open, RIGHT open. Eventually I'll be trapped in the bottom-left corner.\n- Not ideal for chasing the enemy who is also on the left side. We might just get stuck in a loop.\n\n**DOMINATION STRATEGY:**\nI have the apple lead - I should be aggressive! Going RIGHT to (2,6) is the power move. It gives me more space to maneuver and sets up a pincer movement on the enemy. From the center-right, I can chase them toward the left wall or corner. If they go for the apple at (2,0), I can potentially cut them off later.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nBoth moves are safe. If I go RIGHT and they go RIGHT to (3,1), no collision. If they go UP to (2,2), no collision. If they go DOWN to (2,0) for the apple, they're at (2,0) - I'm at (2,6) - we're far apart. If I go DOWN to (1,5), we're both on the left side but separated vertically.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (2,6), I'll try to move toward y=1-2 while staying at x>=2. My goal is to cut off their escape route to the right. If they're forced left into x=0 or x=1, they might crash into their own body or the wall. With 3 apples vs 2, a head-on collision is MY WIN.\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS THE PLAY!** Let's escape the left wall and take control of the center-right!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break this down LIVE! \ud83d\udca5\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- **My snake #1:** Head at (2,6), body [(1,6), (0,6), (0,7)]. 3 apples - TIED with enemy at 3 apples! \n- **Snake #0:** Head at (2,0), body [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)]. 3 apples - TIED!\n- **Board:** 10x10, enemy is LOW on the left side (y=0-1), I'm MID-HIGH (y=6-7). I have room to maneuver! \n\n**SAFETY CHECK from (2,6):**\nBoard row 6: \"T T 1 . . . . . A .\" - my head is at (2,6) looking at:  \n- **UP:** (2,7) - Board row 7: \"T . . . . . . . . .\" - (2,7) is EMPTY! (The \"T\" is at (0,7)). My body: none there. Enemy body: none there. SAFE!\n- **DOWN:** (2,5) - Board row 5: \" . . . . . . A . . .\" - (2,5) is EMPTY! SAFE!\n- **LEFT:** (1,6) - **DEAD!** My own body segment is there (head was at (1,6) last turn). Moving backwards into myself = instant death. \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (3,6) - Board row 6 col 3: \" . \" - EMPTY! SAFE!\n\n**SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.** LEFT is suicide. \n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #0 at (2,0) with body [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1)]. Their possible moves:\n- **UP:** (2,1) - **THEIR OWN BODY!** They'd die instantly. Unless they're braindead, they won't do this.\n- **DOWN:** (2,-1) - **OFF BOARD!** y=-1 doesn't exist. Death move. \n- **LEFT:** (1,0) - Board row 0: \" . . A A . A . . . A\" - (1,0) is EMPTY! Safe move.\n- **RIGHT:** (3,0) - Board row 0 col 3: \"A\" - An apple! They might go for it to grow (3 apples \u2192 4).\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY - TIE GAME!** \nWe're DEAD EVEN at 3 apples each. If we collide heads now, it's a DOUBLE KILL \u2192 DRAW (both dead, equal apples). I need to AVOID head-on collision unless I can force it when I have MORE apples!\n\n**MY OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (2,7):** \n   - Pros: Moves me toward the top edge, opens up y=7-9 territory. Gets me closer to apples at (9,3), (8,6), (7,4). I can potentially circle back down to chase enemy later.\n   - Cons: Enemy is LOW, so this distances me from them for now. But that's okay - I don't want to collide while tied!\n\n2. **DOWN to (2,5):**\n   - Pros: Brings me closer to the enemy (y=5 vs y=6). More central position. Gets me closer to apples at (6,5), (5,2), (7,4).\n   - Cons: I'll be at y=5, enemy at y=0-1. Still separated by 4-5 rows, no immediate collision risk.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (3,6):**\n   - Pros: Moves me toward the RIGHT side where more apples are ((8,6), (7,4), (9,3)). Expands my territory away from enemy's left-side domain. Good for long-term growth.\n   - Cons: Keeps me at y=6, still far from enemy.\n\n**DECISION - GO RIGHT!** \n\n**WHY RIGHT?** \n- **Territory Domination:** The enemy is clustered on the LEFT (x=0-3, y=0-1). Going RIGHT (x=3+) lets me claim the RIGHT side of the board. This is a classic boxing strategy - force them into a corner on the left while I control the right.\n- **Apple Access:** There are MULTIPLE apples on the right side: (8,6), (7,4), (9,3), (9,0). I'll be in position to grab these and GROW my lead!\n- **Avoid Collision:** While tied at 3 apples, ANY head-on collision = draw. I need to create space to safely grow to 4+ apples FIRST, THEN hunt them down.\n- **Future Mobility:** From (3,6), I have open moves: UP to (3,7), DOWN to (3,5), RIGHT to (4,6). Great options! LEFT is also open but would bring me back.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \n1. **Turn 8:** RIGHT to (3,6) - claim center-right territory.\n2. **Turn 9-10:** Move toward y=4-5 area, pick up an apple (maybe (7,4) or (6,5)) to reach 4 apples.\n3. **Once I'm at 4 apples:** Enemy likely at 3 or 4. If I have LEAD, I can aggressively chase them left into their own body or a wall. If still tied, keep growing safely.\n4. **Endgame:** Once I have apple lead, force a head-on collision when they have NO escape route on the left edge. That's a WIN!\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS THE PLAY!** We're going RIGHT to take over the right side of the map while the enemy is stuck on the left! Let's build that lead! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** \n- If enemy goes RIGHT to (3,0) for the apple: They're at (3,0), I'm at (3,6) - no collision.\n- If enemy goes LEFT to (1,0): They're moving away from me. Good!\n- If enemy somehow goes UP (suicide): They die, I win instantly. \n- My move is SAFE and positions me for growth. \n\n**CHAT, READY?** Let's move RIGHT and take control! \ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

Opens up top territory.\n   - Cons: Enemy is LOW, so this distances me. I might fall further behind on apple growth.\n\n2. **DOWN to (3,5):**\n   - Pros: Brings me CLOSER to the enemy (y=5 vs y=0). Gets me closer to apples at (6,5), (5,2), (7,4). More central position.\n   - Cons: Still 5 rows away from enemy, no immediate collision risk.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (4,6):**\n   - Pros: Expands RIGHT territory, gets me closer to apples at (8,6), (7,4), (9,3). Good for future growth.\n   - Cons: Keeps me at y=6, still far from enemy. Might delay apple collection.\n\n**DECISION - GO DOWN!**\n\n**WHY DOWN?**\n- **APPLE HUNTING:** I'm BEHIND 3-4!

From (3,6), going DOWN to (3,5) puts me in position to CHASE that apple!\n- **CLOSE THE GAP:** Enemy is at y=0-1, I'm at y=6. Going DOWN reduces the vertical separation, bringing me into the same \"neighborhood\" for potential future confrontation (when I have the lead!).\n- **CENTRAL POSITION:** (3,5) is more CENTRAL on the board. From there I have access to BOTH left and right sides, giving me flexibility to react to enemy movements.\n- **SAFETY:** DOWN is SAFE - no enemy bodies, no my body, on board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. **Turn 9:** DOWN to (3,5) - get central, chase apple at (6,5).\n2. **Turn 10-11:** Move RIGHT toward (6,5) apple. EAT IT to reach 4 apples!\n3. **Once I'm at 4 apples:** Tied! Then I can start applying PRESSURE - move toward enemy's left-side territory.\n4. **Once I have LEAD (5+ apples):** AGGRESSIVE HUNT! Box them into left edge, force head-on collision when they have NO escape.\n5. **ENDGAME:** When I have apple lead, force collision on MY TERMS. That's a WIN!\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS THE PLAY!** I'm falling behind, so I need to be AGGRESSIVE about apple collection! Going DOWN to position for the apple at (6,5). We're not just surviving, we're HUNTING! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc80\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- If enemy goes UP to (3,1): They're moving UP, I'm going DOWN - no collision, gap remains.\n- If enemy goes RIGHT to (4,0): They're on the left edge, I'm central - no issue.\n- My move is SAFE and positions me to CATCH UP on apples!\n\n**CHAT, LET'S GO!** We need that apple to tie it up! \ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We need to CATCH UP!\n- **Board:** Enemy is LOW (y=0-1), I'm MIDDLE (y=5). I need apples FAST to TIE and then TAKE THE LEAD!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK from (3,5):**\nBoard row 5: \" . . . 1 . . A . . .\" - my head at (3,5) looking at:\n- **UP:** (3,6) - Board row 6: \" . T T T . . . . A .\" - (3,6) is MY OWN BODY!

SAFE!\n- **RIGHT:** (4,5) - Board row 5 col 4: \" . \" - EMPTY! SAFE!\n\n**SAFE MOVES: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.** UP is suicide (backwards into my own body).\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #0 at (3,1) with body [(3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (1,1)]. Their possible moves:\n- **UP:** (3,2) - Board row 2: \" . . . . . A . A A A\" - (3,2) is EMPTY! Safe move.\n- **DOWN:** (3,0) - **THEIR OWN BODY!** They'd die instantly. \u274c\n- **LEFT:** (2,1) - **THEIR OWN BODY!** They'd die instantly. \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (4,1) - Board row 1: \" . . . T T . . . A .\" - (4,1) is EMPTY! Safe move.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY - CATCH UP TIME!**\nI'm DOWN 3-4 on apples. I need to eat an apple THIS TURN if possible! Looking at apples:\n- (6,5) is 3 moves away via RIGHT\u2192RIGHT\u2192RIGHT\n- (5,2) is 3 moves away via DOWN\u2192DOWN\u2192RIGHT  \n- (5,0) is 5 moves away\n- (9,4) is far\n\nBut wait! There's an apple at (8,6) - that's just 3 moves RIGHT\u2192RIGHT\u2192RIGHT from (3,5)! Actually let's check: (3,5)\u2192(4,5)\u2192(5,5)\u2192(6,5) but (6,5) is apple! So RIGHT to (4,5) gets me closer to (6,5) apple which is 2 moves away after that.\n\n**MY OPTIONS:**\n1. **DOWN to (3,4):** Gets me closer to bottom apples (5,0), (5,2), (9,0). But bottom is enemy territory - risky!\n2. **LEFT to (2,5):** Moves me away from main apple clusters. Left side is empty. Not ideal.\n3. **RIGHT to (4,5):** **BEST OPTION!** Moves me DIRECTLY toward apple at (6,5) - just 2 moves away! Also gets me closer to (8,6) and (7,4) apples. This is my apple highway!\n\n**DECISION - GO RIGHT!**\n\n**WHY RIGHT?**\n- **APPLE HUNTING:** The apple at (6,5) is ONLY 2 moves away via (4,5)\u2192(5,5)\u2192(6,5)! Going RIGHT puts me on the FAST TRACK to eat and tie at 4 apples!\n- **TERRITORY CONTROL:** RIGHT keeps me in the CENTER-RIGHT where most apples are clustered! I'll have access to (6,5), (8,6), (7,4), (9,3) - the JUICY ones!\n- **ENEMY AVOIDANCE:** Enemy is on the LEFT edge. Going RIGHT moves me AWAY from them, giving me space to grow without collision risk.\n- **FUTURE MOVES:** From (4,5), I'll have SAFE options to (5,5), (4,4), (4,6) - nice flexibility!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. **Turn 10:** RIGHT to (4,5) - position for apple at (6,5).\n2. **Turn 11:** RIGHT to (5,5) - getting CLOSER.\n3. **Turn 12:** RIGHT to (6,5) - EAT APPLE! TIE at 4 apples!\n4. **Once tied:** AGGRESSIVE PRESSURE! Move toward enemy's left territory while maintaining apple lead.\n5. **Once I have lead (5+ apples):** HUNT MODE! Box enemy into corner, force head-on collision when they have NO escape.\n6. **ENDGAME:** When leading, force collision on MY TERMS. VICTORY!\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS THE PLAY!** I need that apple to TIE IT UP! Going RIGHT to set up the perfect apple grab! We're not just playing - we're HUNTING! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc80\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- If enemy goes UP to (3,2): They're moving UP-left, I'm going RIGHT - no collision!\n- If enemy goes RIGHT to (4,1): They're on bottom-left, I'm on middle-right - perfect separation!\n- My move is SAFE and positions me to CATCH UP on apples THIS TURN!\n\n**CHAT, LET'S GO!** We need that apple to tie it up! RIGHT is the play! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Current safe options: UP to (3,2) or RIGHT to (4,1). DOWN and LEFT are immediate self-collisions.\n\nDECISION SUMMARY\n- Safe moves: UP (3,2) or RIGHT (4,1). Both keep us alive this turn.\n- Not safe: DOWN (3,0) would hit our own body; LEFT (2,1) would hit our body.\n- Plan: Choose UP to start stacking a vertical corridor on x = 3 and keep bottom escape lanes open for future pressure.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (Turn 10\u201312)\n- Establish a vertical grip along x = 3 by stepping UP to (3,2).\n- Maintain space to pivot and dodge if the opponent shifts toward our corridor.\n- Push for a controlled head-on later when it benefits our current apples lead (4 vs 3).\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY\n- Box him in with the vertical line while keeping mobility on the bottom edge. If he commits downward along x = 3, we\u2019ll have the center/low lanes to pivot and threaten a collision without getting trapped.\n\nDECISION PROCESS\n- Evaluate all four directions for safety.\n- Eliminate obvious suicides (board edge, self-collision, or running into enemy body).\n- Favor moves that preserve multiple safe follow-ups and draw the enemy into favorable positions.\n\nFINAL MOVE (TURN 10)\nUP",

We are behind 3-5 in apples, but we have the **positional advantage** and a **clear path to victory**.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS (Visual from the map):**\n*   **My Snake (1):** Head (5,5). Body at (4,5), (3,5), (3,6). Tail at (3,6).\n*   **Enemy Snake (0):** Head (3,3). Body at (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0). Tail at (2,0).\n*   **Apple at (6,5):** This is the immediate target. It's a juicy +1.\n*   **Enemy Position:** They are currently at (3,3). They have a long vertical body running from x=3 down to y=0.\n    *   If they move **UP** to (3,4): Safe. But they aren't close to me.\n    *   If they move **DOWN** to (3,2): They hit their own body! Instant death.\n    *   If they move **LEFT** to (2,3): Safe.\n    *   If they move **RIGHT** to (4,3): Safe, moves them into the center.\n\n**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK FOR MY MOVE:**\nI am currently at (5,5).\n*   **UP (5,6):** Board shows `(3,6)` is my tail. `(5,6)` is empty (row 6: `. . . T T . . . . A .`). Safe.\n*   **DOWN (5,4):** Board row 4 is empty in the middle. Safe.\n*   **LEFT (4,5):** **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** That is my own body segment. \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (6,5):** **THE GOAL!** This is the apple at (6,5).\n\n**STRATEGIC EXECUTION:**\nI need to close the score gap. I am currently at 3 apples, Enemy at 5.\nMoving **RIGHT** to (6,5) guarantees I eat the apple this turn, moving me to 4 apples.\nI am still behind, but I am closing the gap.\n\n**PREDICTING THE ENEMY:**\nThe enemy is at (3,3).\nIf they move **RIGHT** to (4,3), they move into the center.\nIf they move **UP** to (3,4), they move vertically.\nIf they move **LEFT** to (2,3), they stay on the left edge.\n*Crucially*, none of these moves bring them immediately to my head at (6,5) or the apple at (6,5). The distance is safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**\n1.  **Turn 12:** Move **RIGHT** to (6,5). Eat the apple. Score: 4. Position: (6,5).\n2.  **Turn 13:** Assess the board. I will likely need to move UP to (6,6) or (7,6) to avoid getting boxed in by the growing length of the enemy or my own tail. The apple at (8,6) is a potential next target if I can secure the path.\n3.  **Turn 14-15:** Continue hunting apples to tie and surpass the score.\n4.  **Win Condition:** Once I lead in score, I will use my length to cut off the enemy's access to apples and force a collision on my terms.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am moving **RIGHT** to secure the apple at (6,5). It is the only move that increases my score this turn while keeping me safe from the enemy's current position.\n\nRIGHT",

Distance is large. I am safe from immediate collision this turn.\n\n**MOVES:**\n1.  **UP to (6,6):** Check map. Row 6, x=6 is `.` (Empty). This is safe. It moves me toward the apple at (8,6).\n2.  **DOWN to (6,4):** Check map. Row 4: `4 . . . . . . . A A A`\n    - x=6 is `.` (Empty). This is safe. But moving down moves me away from the apple at (8,6) and away from the enemy (who is at y=3). It's safe, but not advancing my agenda.\n3.  **LEFT to (5,5):** Check map. Row 5, x=5 is `T` (My own body). **DEATH.** \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (7,5):** Check map. Row 5, x=7 is `.` (Empty). This is safe. It keeps me on the same row, moving horizontally.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to catch up to the enemy's score (4 vs 5).\nThe nearest apple is at **(8,6)**.\nTo get there, I need to increase my Y (Up) and increase my X (Right).\n- Moving **UP** to (6,6) gets me closer to (8,6).\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (7,5) also gets me closer, but I'll have to turn up later.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI want to secure the apple at (8,6). It's on row 6.\nMy current Y is 5.\nIf I move **UP** to (6,6), I am on the same row as the apple (y=6), and my X is 6. I am 2 steps away (6,6) -> (7,6) -> (8,6).\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (7,5), I am still on y=5. To get to (8,6), I'd need to move RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n\nLet's look at the board state for (6,6). It's empty.\nLet's look at the board state for (7,5). It's empty.\n\nIs there a reason to go DOWN? No, that stalls.\nIs there a reason to go LEFT? No, death.\nIs there a reason to go RIGHT? It's safe, but puts me further from the apple on row 6.\n\nLet's go **UP**. It's the most direct route to the apple at (8,6). The enemy is at (4,3), far away. I need to grow.\n\n**PLAN:**\nTurn 13: Move UP to (6,6).\nTurn 14: Move RIGHT to (7,6).\nTurn 15: Move RIGHT to (8,6) - EAT APPLE.\n\nLet's go!\n\nUP",

I'm at (6,6) after eating that apple last turn, and my score is now 4. The enemy is at 5 apples, so I'm still trailing. I need to make a move that keeps me alive, aggressive, and ready to dominate.\n\n**CHECKING THE BOARD STATE:**\nI'm at (6,6). My body is behind me at (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5).\nThe enemy is at (5,3) - wait, looking at the board map for Turn 14, the '0' is actually at (5,3)? Let me read the map again.\n\nRow 3: `. . . T T 0 . . . A`\nThat's x=0-2 empty, x=3 T, x=4 T, x=5 0. Yes, Snake #0 is at **(5,3)**.\nBody: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0)].\nDistance from my head (6,6) to enemy head (5,3) is large. No immediate collision threat this turn.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (6,6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6,7):** Check map. Row 7 is empty (`7 . . . . . . . . . .`). Safe. Increases distance from enemy (who is at y=3). Moves me toward the top, but away from the nearest apple at (8,6). Keeps options open.\n2.  **DOWN to (6,5):** Check map. Row 5, x=5 is `T` (My own body part (5,5)). **DEATH.** \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (5,6):** Check map. Row 6, x=5 is `.` (Empty). Safe. Moves me toward the apple at (8,6) (decreasing X distance? No, 5->6 is closer to 8? 8-5=3, 8-6=2. Yes, closer). Also moves me closer to the enemy horizontally, but y-distance is large. \n4.  **RIGHT to (7,6):** Check map. Row 6, x=7 is `.` (Empty). Safe. Moves me toward the apple at (8,6). X distance becomes 1.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI need to eat apples to catch up. The nearest apple is at (8,6). I am currently at (6,6).\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (7,6) puts me right next to the apple at (8,6). Next turn, I can eat it. This is the most direct route.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (5,6) also moves me closer (distance 3 -> 2), but it's slightly slower than RIGHT.\n- Moving **UP** to (6,7) is safe, but moves me away from the apple. The enemy is far away, so I don't need to flee vertically yet. I need to be aggressive and eat.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am playing catch-up (4 vs 5 apples). I cannot afford to stall. I must secure the apple at (8,6).\nThe path (6,6) -> (7,6) -> (8,6) is clear.\nMy tail will move from (3,5) to (4,5) after I move, so no self-collision on (7,6) or (8,6) next turn.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **RIGHT** to (7,6). This positions me perfectly to eat the apple at (8,6) on the next turn (Turn 15). This is the fastest way to score and tie up the game.\n\nLet's make it happen!\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- Enemy at (6, 4).\n- They can move UP to (6, 5), DOWN to (6, 3) (their tail, but tail moves away), LEFT to (5, 4), or RIGHT to (7, 4).\n- If I stay at (8, 6), I am far enough away. We are not in immediate head-on collision range for this turn.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **ELIMINATE DEATH:**\n    - **LEFT** is blocked by my own body. \u274c\n2.  **ANALYZE SURVIVAL MOVES:**\n    - **UP (8, 7):** Moves me deeper into the top right quadrant. Safe. Opens up future moves towards (9, 7), (8, 8), etc.\n    - **DOWN (8, 5):** Moves me closer to the center. Safe. However, (8, 5) is right above the apple at (8, 4). Moving DOWN puts me directly above the next target.\n    - **RIGHT (9, 6):** Moves me to the far edge. Safe. But limits my future movement to only LEFT or UP/DOWN. The right wall is a trap eventually.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am tied 5-5. I need to secure the next apple to gain the lead. There is an apple at **(8, 4)**. If I go **DOWN** to (8, 5), I am adjacent to that apple. If I go UP, I am moving away from the center of action.\n\nHowever, looking at the board, there is an apple at (9, 4) and (8, 4). Going **DOWN** to (8, 5) positions me perfectly to eat (8, 4) next turn or chase (9, 4).\n\nWait, looking closer at the board grid:\nRow 4: `. . . . . . 0 A A A` (Indices 0-9). So (8, 4) and (9, 4) are apples.\nRow 5: `. . . . T T T . . .` (Indices 0-9). (6,5) is my body. (5,5) is my body.\nRow 6: `. . . . . . T T 1 .` (Indices 0-9). (8,6) is my head.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (8, 5), I am moving into an empty space (since my body is at 7,6 and 6,6).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (9, 6), I am at the wall. If the enemy comes up, I have limited retreat.\nIf I go **UP** to (8, 7), I am safe but moving away from the apple at (8,4).\n\n**Aggressive Play:** The apple at (8, 4) is prime real estate. I want it.\n**Path:** (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4) [Eat].\n**Risk:** If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 4), they are far. If they move UP to (6, 5), they are close to my previous tail but I am at (8, 5). We don't collide.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **UP:** Safe, but stalls.\n- **RIGHT:** Safe, but cornered.\n- **DOWN:** Safe, positions for apple (8, 4) or (9, 4). **BEST AGGRESSIVE OPTION.**\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to (8, 5) to position directly above the apple at (8, 4). Next turn, secure the apple to take the lead 6-5. Keep the enemy confined to the left side of the board.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am moving **DOWN** to chase the apple at (8, 4).\n\nDOWN",

So we\u2019ve got two clean options: LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nSHORT TAKE:\n- RIGHT grabs the apple at (7,4) and grows us, boosting score and midboard presence, but could invite a riskier chase and potential head-on if they clash over (7,4).\n- LEFT keeps the current wall vibe, preserves more controlled space, and avoids a tempting but risky apple snag this turn.\n\nDECISION:\nI\u2019ll go with LEFT to maintain safer control and keep the box-building pressure without inviting a reckless head-on this turn.\n\nPLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:\n- Use the new head position at (5,4) to extend the central barrier (along with the existing body line on y=3) and steer the opponent toward tighter confines.\n- Wait for a clean moment to pivot upward or rightward to squeeze toward the top-right corner, forcing a panic retreat or collision.\n- Keep an eye on apple drops to opportunistically grow when it still supports the box strategy rather than breaking the enclosure.\n\nMOVE PLAN: LEFT\nEND PLAN\n\nLEFT",

Let's break this down.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **MY CURRENT POSITION:** Head at (8, 5) after moving DOWN last turn. Body follows: (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5).\n2.  **CHECK SURVIVAL MOVES:**\n    *   **UP (8, 6):** My body is at (8, 6). That's immediate death. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN (8, 4):** This is the apple! If I move here, I eat and grow. Is it safe? Let's check the board.\n        *   Board state shows row 4: `. . . . . . 0 A A A`.\n        *   Coordinate (8, 4) is marked as an apple.\n        *   Enemy Snake #0 is at (5, 4) (Head).\n        *   Enemy body is at (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3).\n        *   (8, 4) is currently empty of enemy bodies. It's a valid apple spot. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (7, 5):** Let's check board state.\n        *   Row 5: `. . . . T T T . . .` (Indices 0-9).\n        *   (7, 5) is a `T`. Wait, looking at my body: I am at (8, 5). My body behind me is (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5).\n        *   (7, 5) is NOT in my body list. It's a `T` on the board? Let me look closer at the visual grid.\n        *   Row 5 (y=5): `. . . . T T T . . .`\n        *   Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n        *   (4,5) is `T`.\n        *   (5,5) is `T` (My tail).\n        *   (6,5) is `T` (My body).\n        *   (7,5) is `T` (My body? No, wait).\n        *   Let's look at my body list again: (8, 5) HEAD, (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5).\n        *   (7, 5) is NOT in that list.\n        *   However, (7, 6) is my body. If I move LEFT to (7, 5), I am not hitting my body directly.\n        *   BUT, looking at the enemy: They are at (5, 4). They could move RIGHT to (6, 4), UP to (5, 5), or DOWN to (5, 3).\n        *   (5, 5) is MY tail.\n        *   If I move LEFT to (7, 5), I am safe from immediate collision.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 5):**\n        *   Row 5: `. . . . T T T . . .` (Indices 0-9).\n        *   (9, 5) is empty (looks like a `.` at the end of row 5). Safe.\n\n3.  **ANALYZING THE OPTIONS:**\n    *   **UP:** Death. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN:** Moves to (8, 4). This is the apple. It's highly aggressive. I secure the lead (6-5). I grow.\n    *   **LEFT:** Moves to (7, 5). Safe. But I am moving AWAY from the apple (8, 4). I am moving closer to the center where the enemy is.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Moves to (9, 5). Safe. But I am moving away from the apple (8, 4).\n\n4.  **STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\n    *   We are tied 5-5. We need the lead.\n    *   The apple at (8, 4) is right there. I am currently at (8, 5). One move DOWN gets it.\n    *   If I don't take it, the enemy might path towards it or block it.\n    *   Is there a risk of head-on collision if I go DOWN?\n        *   Enemy is at (5, 4).\n        *   Enemy moves:\n            *   RIGHT to (6, 4) (Body is there, so valid).\n            *   UP to (5, 5) (My tail is there).\n            *   DOWN to (5, 3) (Body is there).\n            *   LEFT to (4, 4).\n        *   None of these moves land them on (8, 4).\n        *   What about the turn *after*? If I eat (8, 4), I grow. My tail stays at (5, 5) (assuming I didn't eat last turn, wait, I did eat last turn? No, I moved DOWN to (8,5) this turn. I didn't eat.\n        *   Wait, look at the prompt: \"Turn: 17 / 150\". \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): ... Apples collected: 5\". \"OPPONENTS: ... Apples: 5\".\n        *   Last turn (16), I moved DOWN to (8, 5). I did NOT eat an apple.\n        *   So my body length is constant for this move.\n        *   If I move DOWN to (8, 4) [Apple], I eat. I grow. My tail (5, 5) stays.\n        *   Enemy potential moves. If enemy moves UP to (5, 5), and I grow, my tail (5, 5) stays because I ate at (8, 4).\n        *   Wait, simultaneous movement.\n        *   I move (8, 5) -> (8, 4). I eat.\n        *   Enemy moves (5, 4) -> (5, 5).\n        *   (5, 5) is currently my tail.\n        *   If I eat, I GROW. My tail (5, 5) does NOT move this turn.\n        *   If the enemy moves into (5, 5), they hit my tail. They die.\n        *   **REVENGE SCENARIO:** If I go DOWN to eat the apple, and the enemy moves UP to (5, 5), the enemy dies.\n        *   This is a massive win condition. I get the apple AND kill the enemy.\n\n5.  **COMPARISON:**\n    *   **DOWN:** Gain apple (6-5 lead). Potential to kill enemy if they move to (5, 5).\n    *   **LEFT/RIGHT:** No apple. No kill. Just positioning.\n\n    **CONCLUSION:** The risk of moving DOWN is low. The reward is high. The apple is at (8, 4). The enemy is at (5, 4). The distance is 3 squares. If the enemy rushes me, I eat and expand.\n\n    Let's check board state for (8, 4) again.\n    Row 4: `. . . . . . 0 A A A`\n    Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    (6, 4) is '0' (Enemy body).\n    (7, 4) is 'A' (Apple).\n    (8, 4) is 'A' (Apple).\n    (9, 4) is 'A' (Apple).\n\n    Wait, looking at the board grid provided in the prompt:\n    Row 4: `. . . . . . 0 A A A`\n    (7, 4) is an apple.\n    (8, 4) is an apple.\n    (9, 4) is an apple.\n\n    My head is at (8, 5).\n    If I go DOWN to (8, 4), I am on top of the apple.\n    If I go DOWN, I am eating.\n\n    Let's look at the enemy body list again: (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3).\n    The board grid shows `0` at (6, 4). Correct.\n    The board grid shows `0` at (5, 4)? No, the grid says (5, 4) is `.`? No, wait.\n    Row 4: `. . . . . . 0 A A A`\n    Indices 0-5 are dots.\n    Index 6 is '0'.\n    Index 7 is 'A'.\n    Index 8 is 'A'.\n    Index 9 is 'A'.\n\n    BUT, the prompt says: \"OPPONENTS: Snake #0 - Head: (5, 4)\".\n    There is a discrepancy between the visual grid and the text data.\n    **Rule 1:** Trust the text data coordinates for logic.\n    **Rule 2:** The visual grid is an approximation.\n\n    Text Data: Enemy Head (5, 4). Enemy Body: (6, 4)...\n    So (5, 4) is the head. (6, 4) is the body.\n    The visual grid shows '0' at index 6 (x=6).\n    The visual grid shows '.' at index 5 (x=5).\n    The visual grid shows '0' at index 6.\n    This implies the visual grid might be shifted or the text data is absolute truth.\n\n    **I must trust the coordinates provided in the text list.**\n    Enemy Head: (5, 4).\n    Enemy Body: [(6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)].\n\n    If I move DOWN to (8, 4):\n    Destination: (8, 4).\n    Is (8, 4) an apple? Yes, visual grid says so. Text list of apples says so.\n    Is (8, 4) occupied by enemy body? No.\n    Is (8, 4) occupied by enemy head?\n        Enemy head is at (5, 4). They can move:\n        - Right to (6, 4) (Body is there).\n        - Left to (4, 4).\n        - Up to (5, 5).\n        - Down to (5, 3) (Body is there).\n        They cannot reach (8, 4) in one turn.\n\n    So (8, 4) is safe to move to.\n    Is it a good move?\n    I get an apple. I go 6-5.\n    I grow. My tail (5, 5) stays.\n    If enemy moves UP to (5, 5), they die.\n    If enemy moves LEFT/RIGHT, they survive but I have the lead.\n\n    This looks like the winning play.\n\n    Let's double check the visual grid for row 4 at index 8.\n    Row 4: `. . . . . . 0 A A A`\n    Index 8 is the 9th character (0-indexed). It is 'A'.\n    Yes.\n\n    So the plan is:\n    1. Move DOWN to (8, 4).\n    2. Eat apple.\n    3. Lead 6-5.\n    4. Hope enemy moves UP into my tail for a kill.\n\n    What if I don't eat?\n    If I go LEFT to (7, 5):\n    I am safe. No apple.\n    If I go RIGHT to (9, 5):\n    I am safe. No apple.\n\n    I must take the apple.\n\n    **PLAN:**\n    Move DOWN to eat the apple at (8, 4). This secures the lead. If the enemy attempts to move UP to my tail at (5, 5), they crash and die. This is the optimal aggressive play.\n\n    Check for traps:\n    (8, 4) is an edge case? No, it's x=8, y=4. Board is 10x10 (0-9).\n    (8, 4) is safe.\n\n    One final check: Is there an apple at (8, 4)?\n    \"APPLE DROPS: (7, 2), (0, 9), (9, 0), (8, 1), (3, 9), (9, 3), (5, 0), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 4), (5, 2), (9, 4), (8, 9), (8, 4), (2, 9)\"\n    Yes! (8, 4) is in the apple list.\n\n    This is it.\n\n    **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n    Eat the apple at (8, 4) to take the lead 6-5. Position myself to cut off the enemy's access to the right side. If the enemy moves UP into my tail, I win instantly. Next turn, look to secure the apple at (9, 4) or trap the enemy in the bottom-left.\n\nDOWN",

We are currently winning 6-5 after that last clutch apple eat! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 But hold up, let's check the board state carefully.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CHECK CURRENT STATE:**\n    *   My Head: (8, 4). I am currently sitting on the apple I just ate.\n    *   My Body: (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5).\n    *   Enemy Head: (5, 4).\n    *   Enemy Body: (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3).\n\n2.  **EVALUATE MOVES (Simultaneous Movement):**\n    *   **UP (8, 5):** Currently occupied by my own body. If I go UP, I die. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN (8, 3):** Let's check the board.\n        *   Row 3 visual: `. . . . T T T . . A`\n        *   (8, 3) appears to be empty (represented by a dot visually, or a potential apple?).\n        *   Check Apple List: `(8, 3)` is NOT in the apple list.\n        *   Check Enemy: Enemy is at (5, 4). They can't reach (8, 3) in one turn.\n        *   **Verdict:** Safe move. But does it help me? It moves me down towards the bottom right.\n    *   **LEFT (7, 4):**\n        *   Check Apple List: `(7, 4)` is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n        *   Visual Check: Row 4: `. . . . . . 0 A A A`. Index 7 is 'A'.\n        *   Is it safe?\n            *   My body: (8, 5)... (7, 4) is not in my body.\n            *   Enemy: Enemy at (5, 4). They are 2 squares away. They cannot reach (7, 4) in one turn (max speed is 1).\n            *   **Verdict:** SAFE and EATS AN APPLE. This increases lead to 7-5.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 4):**\n        *   Check Apple List: `(9, 4)` is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n        *   Visual Check: Row 4: Index 9 is 'A'.\n        *   Is it safe?\n            *   My body: Safe.\n            *   Enemy: Safe (too far).\n            *   **Verdict:** SAFE and EATS AN APPLE.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY - BOXING HIM IN:**\n    *   We have two apple options: LEFT to (7, 4) or RIGHT to (9, 4).\n    *   **LEFT (7, 4)** moves me closer to the enemy (distance 2).\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 4)** moves me to the far right edge.\n\n    *   **The Trap:**\n        *   If I go **LEFT to (7, 4)**, I eat the apple. I grow.\n        *   Enemy is at (5, 4). Their only safe moves are likely UP (to my old tail (5, 5)?) or LEFT (to (4, 4)).\n        *   If I go LEFT, I am physically placing my body between the enemy and the right-side apples (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), etc.\n        *   My body will span from (7, 4) to (5, 5).\n        *   The enemy is currently at (5, 4). If they move UP to (5, 5), they die (crash into my tail).\n        *   If they move LEFT to (4, 4), they are safe but I have cut off the right side.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (9, 4), I leave the left side wide open for the enemy to rush apples at (8, 4), (7, 4), etc.\n\n    *   **Aggression:**\n        *   We are 6-5. We want to keep the pressure on.\n        *   Moving LEFT puts us in the center of the board, closer to the enemy, and actively blocks their path to the apple cluster on the right.\n        *   Moving RIGHT runs away to the edge, which is safer in the short term but gives the enemy map control.\n\n    *   **Why LEFT is the winning move:**\n        *   It grabs an apple (7, 4).\n        *   It positions my head at (7, 4).\n        *   My body forms a wall from (8, 5) back to (5, 5).\n        *   Enemy at (5, 4) is essentially trapped against my body or forced to retreat left.\n        *   If enemy moves UP to (5, 5), they die into my tail.\n        *   If enemy moves LEFT to (4, 4), I am in a dominant center position with a lead of 7-5.\n\n    *   **Why RIGHT is risky:**\n        *   It grabs (9, 4), but then I am on the edge. My turn after that will be limited.\n        *   Enemy can take the apples at (7, 4) or (8, 4) and catch up.\n\n    *   **Final Check:**\n        *   Move LEFT to (7, 4).\n        *   (7, 4) is an apple.\n        *   (7, 4) is not my body.\n        *   Enemy cannot reach (7, 4).\n        *   Enemy cannot reach my head (8, 4) next turn? No, they are at (5, 4).\n        *   This is the high-aggro play that dominates the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7, 4) to extend the lead to 7-5. Position my body to cut off the enemy's access to the right side of the board. If the enemy attempts to move UP into my tail (5, 5), they will crash and lose instantly. Maintain center control.\n\nLEFT",

The plan is to extend the central barrier and push him toward the top-right where he\u2019s more cramped and easier to corral.\n- LEFT from (4,4) to (3,4) adds a new wall segment directly adjacent to our current chain (4,4)-(5,4)-(6,4). That creates a solid line along y=4 from x=3 to x=6 after the move, making the row a trap for him as he tries to sweep left.\n\nWhy LEFT now\n- It\u2019s safe: (3,4) is empty; it doesn\u2019t collide with enemy or your neck, and you\u2019re not stepping into a tail that might still be moving (the standard pull-your-tail scenario works in your favor here).\n- It builds a wall, closes options, and keeps the door shut on a fast pass-through to the left without giving him a clean head-on.\n- It preserves future escape routes only when needed, but mostly aims to pin him toward the top-right corner where he has fewer safe lanes.\n\nShort-term plan\n- Turn 18: place head at (3,4) to begin the leftward wall.\n- Turn 19\u201321+: continue extending the wall leftward as safe apples appear, forcing him upward/right into tighter space area and away from easy loops.\n- Avoid chasing apples that would break the wall; priority is lockdown and containment.\n\nDecision: LEFT",

The apple is gone from (7, 4).\n\nThis means I am currently sitting on the apple I just ate, or the apple list provided is the future list, or I missed the apple. Actually, in the last turn I chose LEFT to (7, 4). The apple at (7, 4) was there. I should have eaten it.\n\nLet's re-read my last move rationale. I analyzed (7, 4) as an apple. I moved LEFT.\n\nSo why is the board showing `T` at (7, 4)? Because the board is the *current* state after the move.\nMy body *includes* (7, 4) now.

But we have distinct IDs.\nRow 4: `. . . . . . 0 T T A`\nIndex 6 is `0` (Enemy Head). Index 7 is `T`. Index 8 is `T`.\nMy body list: `[(8, 4), ...]`.\nSo (8, 4) is my body. (7, 4) is my head? No, (7, 4) is the head listed in the prompt.\nWait, the prompt says: `Head: (7, 4)`.\nSo (7, 4) is MY head.\nBut the visual board shows `T` at index 7.\nThis implies the visual board might be slightly outdated or using `T` for *all* static body segments regardless of ID, or the `0` at index 6 is the enemy head.\n\nLet's trust the text coordinates explicitly provided in the prompt over the ASCII art if they conflict, but usually they align.\nPrompt My Head: (7, 4)\nPrompt My Body: `[(8, 4), ...]`\nSo at (7, 4) I am the head.\nAt (8, 4) I am body.\n\nVisual Row 4: `. . . . . . 0 T T A`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n(6, 4) -> `0` (Enemy Head)\n(7, 4) -> `T` (This should be MY Head, but visual says `T`.

The prompt this turn says `(3, 4)`.\nIf the enemy is at `(3, 4)`, they are far away.\nIf the enemy is at `(6, 4)` (visual), they are right next to my body at `(8, 4)` and head at `(7, 4)`.\n\n**Which one is correct?**\nIn the last turn, the prompt said: `Enemy Head: (5, 4)`.\nThis turn, the prompt says: `Head: (3, 4)`.\nThe enemy moved. From (5, 4) to (3, 4)? That's 2 squares left? Snakes move 1 square per turn.\nMaybe the turn counter is 19, and the enemy moved.\nWait, if they were at (5, 4) and moved Left to (4, 4), they would be at (4, 4).\nIf they moved Left again, they'd be at (3, 4).\nThis implies the enemy might have moved twice? Or the prompt data is just the current state and I should trust the coordinates provided in the text block over the ASCII art if they conflict, but usually the ASCII art is the ground truth.\n\nLet's look closely at the ASCII art again.\nRow 4: `. . . . . . 0 T T A`\nLet's index columns 0-9.\n0: `.`\n1: `.`\n2: `.`\n3: `.`\n4: `.`\n5: `.`\n6: `0` (Enemy Head)\n7: `T` (My Body or Head? Prompt says My Head is (7,4))\n8: `T` (My Body)\n9: `A` (Apple)\n\nIf Prompt says My Head is (7, 4), and Visual shows `T` at (7, 4), it's consistent that it's my snake.\nIf Prompt says Enemy Head is (3, 4), and Visual shows `0` at (6, 4), this is a **major conflict**.\n\nLet's assume the **Visual Board** is the physical reality of the game state.\nThe `0` is at (6, 4).\nThe Enemy Body listed is `(4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)`.\nIf the Enemy Head is at (6, 4), and his body is at (5, 4) and (4, 4), that means he is *moving* or the prompt text has a typo in the coordinates.\n\nLet's look at the visual board again.\nRow 4: `. . . . . . 0 T T A`\nRow 5: `. . . . . T T . T .`\nRow 6: `. . . A . . T T T .`\n\nIf the Enemy Head is at (6, 4) (where the `0` is), then he is RIGHT BESIDE my body at (8, 4)? No, distance is 2.\nWait, my body is at (8, 4) and (7, 4) is my head.\nDistance from Enemy Head (6, 4) to My Head (7, 4) is 1 square.\n**THIS IS A HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK.**\n\nIf the Enemy Head is actually at (3, 4) as the text says, he is far away.\nBut the Visual says `0` at (6, 4).\nLet's check the enemy body list provided: `[(4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3)]`.\nIf the head is at (3, 4), then the body (4, 4) connects to it.\nIf the head is at (6, 4), then the body is (5, 4) and (4, 4).\nThe visual `0` at (6, 4) strongly suggests the head is there.\n\n**HYPOTHESIS:** The visual board is correct. The text `(3, 4)` might be a typo for `(6, 4)` or I am misinterpreting the text.\nHowever, usually in these prompts, the visual board is the source of truth for positions.\nLet's look at the enemy body in the visual:\nRow 4: `. . . . . . 0 T T A` -> `(6, 4)` is Enemy Head. `(4, 4)` and `(5, 4)` are empty in visual? No, wait.\nRow 4: indices 4 and 5 are dots `.`.\nBut the prompt body list says `(4, 4)` and `(5, 4)`.\nIf `(4, 4)` and `(5, 4)` are body parts, they should show up as `T` or similar.\nThe visual only shows `0` at `(6, 4)`.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully.\n`OPPONENTS: * Snake #0 - Head: (3, 4), Body: [(4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3)], Apples: 5`\n\nThis is extremely specific. Head (3, 4).\nIf Head is (3, 4), then the snake stretches to (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 4).\nThis means the tail is at (6, 4).\nThe visual `0` at (6, 4) would then represent the TAIL, not the head.\nBut `0` usually represents the Head in Snake games.\nHowever, the prompt explicitly says \"Snake #0 - Head: (3, 4)\".\n\n**DECISION: Trust the explicit text data over the ASCII art representation of specific IDs if there is a conflict, BUT be aware of physical proximity.**\n\nIf Head is at (3, 4):\nDistance to my head (7, 4) is 4 squares. Safe.\n\n**My Moves from (7, 4):**\nMy Body: `(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5)`.\nNote: My body includes (8, 4) (directly to my right).\n\n1.  **RIGHT (8, 4):** Occupied by my own body. **DEADLY.**\n2.  **UP (7, 5):**\n    *   Is it free? Visual Row 5: `. . . . . T T . T .`\n    *   (7, 5) is `.` (empty).\n    *   Is it in my body? My body list doesn't include (7, 5).\n    *   Is it in enemy body? Enemy body is (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). (7, 5) is clear.\n    *   **Safe.**\n3.  **DOWN (7, 3):**\n    *   Visual Row 3: `. . . . . T T . . A` (Indices 0-9)\n    *   (7, 3) is `.` (empty).\n    *   Check body: No.\n    *   Check enemy: No.\n    *   **Safe.**\n4.  **LEFT (7, 3)? No, LEFT is (6, 4).**\n    *   **LEFT (6, 4):**\n    *   Visual Row 4: `. . . . . . 0 T T A`\n    *   (6, 4) is `0`. If this is Enemy Head (per text), then I crash into enemy head -> **Double Death** (Head-on collision).\n    *   If this is Enemy Tail (per text interpretation where head is 3,4), it's still Enemy Body. **I die.**\n    *   **NOT SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI have apples available.\nApple list: `(7, 2), (0, 9), (9, 0), (8, 1), (3, 9), (9, 3), (5, 0), (9, 2), (8, 2), (5, 2), (9, 4), (8, 9), (2, 9), (4, 8), (3, 6)`\n\nMy position: (7, 4).\nClosest apples?\n(9, 4) is on the board (Visual Row 4, index 9 is 'A').\n(9, 3) is listed.\n(8, 2) is listed.\n(7, 2) is listed.\n(5, 2) is listed.\n(3, 6) is listed.\n\n**Available Safe Moves: UP, DOWN.**\nLEFT is blocked by enemy/body (6, 4).\nRIGHT is blocked by my body (8, 4).\n\n**Option A: UP (7, 5)**\n*   Leads towards (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 5) -> (5, 5).

No.\n                *   So (7, 4) becomes **EMPTY** next turn.\n                *   So (7, 5) has an exit: DOWN to (7, 4).\n    *   Okay, (7, 5) is safe for next turn. (7, 4) becomes the new tail tip (technically the cell just vacated).\n    *   However, (7, 5) is surrounded by body on 3 other sides (Left, Right, Up).\n    *   This is a \"dead end\" or \"cul-de-sac\".

Very far.\n\n*   **Comparison (UP vs DOWN):**\n    *   **UP (7, 5):** Leads to a tight spot where I can only retreat. No immediate apple. Blocks my own movement.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 3):** Moves towards apples (7, 2), (8, 2), (5, 2). Opens up the bottom right quadrant. More space.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy is at (3, 4). Body is (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3).\nApple at (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4) are available on the right.\nApple at (5, 0), (5, 2) are available.\nApple at (7, 2) is available.\nApple at (3, 6) is available near enemy.\n\nEnemy is closer to (3, 6) and (4, 8) and (2, 9).\nI am closer to (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4).\n\n**Decision:**\nI should go **DOWN**.\nWhy?\n1.  It moves me towards the apple cluster at (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3).\n2.  It avoids boxing myself in at (7, 5).\n3.  It keeps my left flank protected (enemy is far left).\n4.  It gives me access to the bottom edge and bottom-right corner.\n\nWait, let's double check (6, 3) danger.\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 3), and Enemy moves UP from (3, 4) to (3, 5) or something, he's still far.\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT towards me?\nHe is at (3, 4). To reach me at (7, 3), he needs 4 moves. Impossible in 1 turn.\n\nIs there any other threat?\nMy own body?\nGoing DOWN to (7, 3) -> (7, 2) next turn?\nFrom (7, 2), neighbors are (6, 2), (8, 2), (7, 1).\n(6, 2) is empty (Visual check: Row 2 index 6 is `.`\n(8, 2) is apple.\n(7, 1) is empty.\n(7, 2) is safe.\n\nLet's check (9, 3) or (9, 4).\nTo get there, I need to go DOWN first to clear space?\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 3), next turn I can go DOWN to (7, 2) (eat apple), then RIGHT to (8, 2) (eat apple), then RIGHT to (9, 2) (eat apple).\nThis is a clear path to the right side apples.\n\nIf I go UP to (7, 5), I am stuck in the loop (7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 5)...\nI lose access to the right side apples.\n\n**Final Verification:**\nMove DOWN to (7, 3).\nIs (7, 3) on the board? Yes.\nIs (7, 3) occupied by my body? No.\nIs (7, 3) occupied by enemy body?\nEnemy body: (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3).\n(7, 3) is NOT in this list.\nIs (7, 3) occupied by enemy head?\nEnemy head is (3, 4).\nSo (7, 3) is SAFE.\n\nI will output DOWN.\n\nRationale for Chat:\nYo Chat! We're in a tight spot. Going UP traps us in our own loop. Going DOWN opens up the bottom right where all the apples are spawning. (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2) are all there. We need to dominate that area. Enemy is stuck on the left side. Let's secure the food and box him out!\n\nPlan: Go DOWN to (7, 3). Next turn, go DOWN to (7, 2) to eat the apple. Then sweep right to (8, 2) and (9, 2). Keep the pressure on!\n\nOne word: DOWN.\n\nWait, I need to check the \"Apple Drops\" list again.\n`(7, 2)` is in the list.\n`(8, 2)` is in the list.\n`(9, 2)` is in the list.\n`(9, 3)` is in the list.\n`(9, 4)` is in the list.\n`(5, 2)` is in the list.\n\nThe right side is LOADED. I must go there.\n\nComparison with UP:\nUP (7, 5) -> Leads to (7, 6) which is my body. From (7, 5), I can only go DOWN (back to 7,4) or LEFT (6,5) which is body, or RIGHT (8,5) body. Wait, if I go UP to (7, 5), the tail moves to (6, 5).\nDoes (6, 5) block my path?\nCurrent body: `(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5)`.\nIf I move UP to (7, 5):\nNew Head: (7, 5).\nOld Head (7, 4) becomes body.\nTail (5, 5) moves to (6, 5).\nNew Body: `(7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5)`.\nMy body now forms a \"C\" shape?\n(8, 4) to (8, 6) is a vertical line on the right.\n(7, 6) to (6, 6) is a horizontal line on top.\n(6, 5) is the tail on the left.\n(7, 5) is the head inside the curve?\nWait, (7, 5) is at x=7, y=5.\nNeighbors:\nUp (7, 6) -> Body.\nDown (7, 4) -> Empty (vacated by head).\nLeft (6, 5) -> Body (Tail).\nRight (8, 5) -> Body.\nSo I can ONLY go DOWN. This is a trap.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the only move that gives me future options.\n\nOne word: DOWN.YO CHAT! We're sitting pretty at 7-5, but we gotta make a move! I'm at (7, 4). Let's look at the board.\n\nIf I go **UP** to (7, 5), I'm walking straight into a trap! My body forms a wall around me there\u2014I can only go back down. That's a dead end, and we don't do dead ends here! \u274c\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (6, 4), I'm either crashing into the enemy head or his body. The visual board shows a `0` there, and the text confirms enemy body is at (6, 4). That's a death sentence. \u274c\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (8, 4), I'm eating my own tail! That's an instant game over. \u274c\n\nSo, the only way to keep the flow alive is **DOWN** to (7, 3)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 This opens up the entire bottom-right side of the board where the apples are raining down\u2014(7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), and more. The enemy is stuck on the left side, and we're about to secure that entire territory. We're not just playing for survival; we're playing for DOMINATION!\n\nDOWN",

We're deep in the trenches here, Turn 20, and the board is looking *spicy*. \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f Let's break down the math because we need to play smart and aggressive. We're up 7 apples to 5, but the enemy is right there in our space.\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nMy head is at **(7, 4)**. My body is blocking the path to the right at (8, 4). The enemy is at **(3, 4)**, but looking at the ASCII board, there's a `0` at **(6, 4)**. Wait, that doesn't match the text coordinates... but in the heat of the game, the visual board is law! If that `0` is at (6, 4), it's either the enemy's position or his tail. Since the text says the enemy is at (3, 4), that `0` at (6, 4) must be his tail or a visual representation of his body extension. Either way, **(6, 4)** is occupied territory. We cannot go there.\n\n**ANALYZING THE MOVES:**\n1.  **UP (7, 5):**\n    *   Is it safe? Let's check the board. (7, 5) shows a `.` (empty).\n    *   Is it in my body? No.\n    *   Is it in the enemy body? The enemy is at (3, 4) with body at (4,4)... (7, 5) is clear.\n    *   **Future Traps:** If I go UP to (7, 5), what's next? My body at (6, 6) and (7, 6) blocks up. My body at (8, 5) blocks right. My body at (6, 5) blocks left. I would be trapped in a box!\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe for 1 turn, but a **DEAD END**. \u274c\n\n2.  **LEFT (6, 4):**\n    *   Visual board shows `0` or `T` there.\n    *   Text says Enemy Body is at (4,4), (5,4), (6,4).\n    *   **Verdict:** CRASH. DEATH. \u274c\n\n3.  **RIGHT (8, 4):**\n    *   My own body is sitting right there.\n    *   **Verdict:** INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n\n4.  **DOWN (7, 3):**\n    *   Visual board shows (7, 3) as `.` (empty).\n    *   Enemy is far away at (3, 4).\n    *   **Future Potential:** This opens up the bottom row!\n        *   (7, 3) -> (7, 2) has an **APPLE**! \ud83c\udf4e\n        *   (7, 2) -> (8, 2) has an **APPLE**!\n        *   (8, 2) -> (9, 2) has an **APPLE**!\n        *   (9, 2) -> (9, 3) has an **APPLE**!\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, and leads to a highway of apples. \u2705\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe are going **DOWN** to (7, 3). This avoids the trap at (7, 5) and the collision at (6, 4). This position gives us access to the massive apple cluster on the right side of the board ((7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)). We need to secure that territory to build a lead that the enemy can't overcome. We're playing the long game here\u2014grow fast, box him out, and force a win.\n\nDOWN",

This maximizes growth and board control.\n\nThe enemy is blocked. If he moves right, he hits his own tail. If he moves down, he's on the bottom edge. If he moves up, he hits the top wall.

My head is (8,2). (7,2) is my neck/body.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**. Hitting my own body. \ud83d\udc80\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** (9, 2) is `A` (Apple).\n    *   **Safety:** It's on the edge, but empty.\n    *   **Comparison:** UP takes (8,3) which is also an apple. (9,2) is *on the edge* (x=9), which limits future right-side movement (dead end if blocked). (8,3) is one step inside from the edge, slightly better flexibility, though both are good.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE + GROWTH. \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe are winning 9-5. We want to maximize growth to hit 30 and end this.\n*   **UP (8,3)** gets us an apple immediately and keeps us slightly more central than (9,2).\n*   **RIGHT (9,2)** gets us an apple immediately but puts us on the absolute edge.\n*   **LEFT (7,2)** is suicide.\n\nWe are basically deciding between two apples: (8,3) or (9,2). (8,3) is vertically aligned with our current position and connects to the apple at (9,3) nicely. (9,2) connects to (9,3) but puts us on the edge.\n\nLet's go **UP** to (8,3). It's an apple, and from there we can look at (9,3) or (8,4) next. (8,4) is currently occupied by my body though, so from (8,3) we'd be forced to go RIGHT or DOWN. Wait, (8,4) is part of my body (from the list: (8,4)). So if I go UP to (8,3), my tail will likely move, opening up (8,2) or (7,3).\n\nActually, looking at the board state again:\nRow 2: `. . . . . A . . 1 A` (My head at 8,2).\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . T . A`\nMy body at (8,4). So moving UP to (8,3) puts me directly below my body at (8,4).\nIf I move UP to (8,3) next turn, I can't go UP again immediately because (8,4) is occupied (unless my tail moves from there). But for *this* turn, (8,3) is empty (it's an apple).\n\nOkay, let's commit. I need points. I'm dominating. I'll take the apple at (8,3).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (8,3). The enemy is trapped in the top-left corner of the bottom left quadrant (1,5). He cannot reach the right side in time to contest. We will continue to sweep the right side apples ((9,3) is next). Once we clear the right side, we will pivot back to the center or top depending on the enemy's position. We must avoid boxing ourselves in against the right wall.\n\nUP\nUP",

Let's break down the survival and the strategy.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (TURN 23):**\nMy head is at **(8, 3)**. My body extends down to (8,2), then left to (7,2), etc. The enemy is still chilling at (1,6), completely irrelevant to us right now. The real danger is the board geometry and our own tail.\n\nLet's check the moves:\n1.  **UP to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** My own body! I can see in the ASCII art row 4: `. T T T T . . T T A` and my body list confirms (8,4) is occupied.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**. \ud83d\udc80 Can't run into myself.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 2):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** My previous head position (from last turn). This counts as my body *after* the move, but currently it's safe? Wait, rules say \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n    *   **Reality Check:** My body list is `[(8, 2), (7, 2), ...]`. (8,2) is currently my neck. If I move DOWN, my head goes to (8,2). That spot is currently occupied by my neck. That is a collision with my own body.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**. \ud83d\udc80\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Looking at row 3: `. . . . . . . T . A`. (9,3) is an Apple (`A`).\n    *   **Safety:** Is it blocked by my body? No. Enemy? No. Wall? x=9 is the edge, but we are *on* the edge. Moving RIGHT would go off-board (x=10).\n    *   **Wait, coordinate check:** My head is (8,3). Right is (9,3). The board goes to (9,9). (9,3) is valid.\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE + GROWTH**. \ud83c\udf4e\n\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 3):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Row 3 shows `. . . . . . . T . A`. (7,3) is marked `T` (Tail/Body). My body list confirms (7,3) is part of my body.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**. \ud83d\udc80\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nThis is a CRUNCH turn. I am boxed in by my own massive body! \n*   Up is blocked by my body at (8,4).\n*   Down is blocked by my neck at (8,2).\n*   Left is blocked by my body at (7,3).\n*   **RIGHT (9,3)** is the ONLY open move. It's an apple, which is a bonus, but the priority is survival. If I don't go Right, I die.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nEat the apple at (9,3). From (9,3), I will be on the edge. My tail will likely move from (7,6) or wherever the end is, opening up space behind me. I need to loop back around carefully. The enemy is no threat, but the board is getting tight.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nIt's survival mode. I have to go **RIGHT**.\n\nRIGHT",

Body [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)]. Apples: 5\n- Opponent Snake #1: Head (8,3). Body [(8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6)]. Apples: 9\n- Apple drops in range, but we ignore for now and focus on the enemy.\n- The left wall is tight under us, and we\u2019ve effectively boxed a corridor so far. We want to keep that pressure.\n\nYOUR MOVE ANALYSIS:\n- Current head at (1,6). Legal moves: UP to (1,7), LEFT to (0,6), RIGHT to (2,6). DOWN is illegal (would hit our own neck at (1,5)).\n- Risk check:\n  - UP (1,7): Safe now, not colliding with any body. Keeps us advancing the warded corridor and prevents the opponent from slipping behind us.\n  - LEFT (0,6): Safe, but at the edge it could trap us if the corridor collapses or limit future options.\n  - RIGHT (2,6): Safe and opens toward (3,6) which has an apple now, but it also nudges us toward the opponent\u2019s side\u2014could invite a chase or a head-on risk.\n- Strategy fit: We stay with containment, not chasing. Going UP keeps the barrier dense beneath and extends our control without giving him an easy out toward the left or the far right.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next few turns):\n- Maintain a vertical containment line by continuing UP from (1,6) to (1,9) as long as safe, slowly sealing off the left column and funneling him toward the right side.\n- Avoid head-on risk unless we have a clear safety margin or apples that won\u2019t pull us into a trap. Our objective is to survive while incrementally increasing our reach and leveraging the wall to block his escape.\n- If he starts threading toward our wall, mirror cautiously to keep the barrier intact, and only branch out when we can do so without exposing a tunnel to be exploited.\n- If a super safe apple is presented within the contained corridor and it won\u2019t open a crash surface, grab it; otherwise, stay tight and pressure him.\n\nDECISION:\n- Move UP to continue the containment front and keep the barrier dense.\n\nUP",

(9,2) is not in my current body list.\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE + GROWTH**. \ud83c\udf4e Also a solid move.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** This was my previous position (the apple I just ate).\n    *   **Safety:** Wait, after I move, my tail moves. (8,3) is currently the \"neck\" and technically occupied, but usually, moving back is safe if the tail moves... NO.\n    *   **Reality Check:** My body list is `[(8, 3), (8, 2), ...]`. If I move LEFT, my head goes to (8,3). That is currently occupied by my neck (which will become body part #2). That is a collision with my own body.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**. \ud83d\udc80 Hitting myself.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Wall.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**. \ud83d\udc80 Off board.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe are trapped in a \"hallway\" on the right edge. If I go **UP** to (9,4), I will be at the top right corner, essentially boxed in. If I go **DOWN** to (9,2), I will be at the bottom right, boxed in.\nHowever, looking at the board, there is a massive open space in the center. To reach it, I need to get off the right wall.\nIf I go **DOWN** to (9,2), I can potentially move LEFT to (8,2) on the next turn (since my tail will move from (7,6), opening up space).\nIf I go **UP** to (9,4), I am closer to the top (y=9) but further from the open center (y=5/y=6).\nActually, wait. If I go **UP** to (9,4), I am stuck in the corner. If I go **DOWN** to (9,2), I have a better angle to cut back left towards the center.\nLet's look at the board again. The center is clear. The right side is full of apples.\nIf I go DOWN, I eat an apple, grow, and then can turn left into the board.\nIf I go UP, I eat an apple, grow, but then I am at the top corner with limited options.\n**DOWN** seems like the move to get back into the flow of the board. (8,2) will be free after my tail moves.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (9,2), turn LEFT on the next move, and snake back into the center of the board to dominate the open space. Keep the score gap widening.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nI'm going for the apple that gives me better board position.\n\nDOWN",

We\u2019re in containment mode and we stay alive first, dominance second.\n\nCurrent facts quick:\n- Your head (1,7); your body occupies (1,6),(1,5),(1,4),(2,4),(3,4).\n- Opponent head (9,3); their body sprawled across the right side.\n- DOWN would crash into your own neck (1,6) \u2014 illegal. LEFT (0,7) is safe but along a thin wall, RIGHT (2,7) is safe but drifts toward them. UP (1,8) is safe and keeps the barrier tight.\n\nSAFE MOVE OPTIONS:\n- UP to (1,8): keeps vertical containment intact, no immediate collision, avoids opening a chase path around your left wall.\n- LEFT to (0,7): at the edge; still safe but risks getting boxed in if the corridor shifts.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): opens toward more space toward the enemy, could invite a chase; not ideal while you\u2019re trying to box him in.\n\nREASONING SUMMARY:\n- UP maintains the dense left-wall corridor, reinforcing containment and limiting the enemy\u2019s easy exit routes.\n- DOWN is dead, so no. LEFT is borderline risky long-term. RIGHT invites more risk without clear immediate payoff.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\n- Push UP along the left wall to y=9 if safe to further seal the corridor.\n- If the opponent starts squeezing toward the wall, mirror cautiously to keep the barrier intact and avoid a head-on trap.\n- Ignore non-critical apples unless they sit in a safe, non-exploitative spot within the contained zone; prioritize survival and box pressure over chasing.\n- If a clean, safe head-on trade appears (and you have angle/space), only take it with a margin of safety.\n\nDECISION:\n- Move UP\n\nUP",

Let's analyze the board.\n\n**MY CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **Head:** (9, 2)\n*   **Body:** `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), ...]` (Length 12)\n*   **Score:** 11 Apples\n\n**ENEMY STATE:**\n*   **Head:** (1, 8)\n*   **Body:** `[(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4)]`\n*   **Score:** 5 Apples\n\n**MOVES:**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 3):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** This is my current neck (the first body segment). My body list starts with `[(9, 3), ...]`.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**. \ud83d\udc80 Hitting myself.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (10, 2):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Wall.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**. \ud83d\udc80 Off board.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (9, 1):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Board state shows `.` at (9, 1). No enemy body there (Enemy is at x=1).\n    *   **Safety:** My body? (9,1) is not in the list.\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE**. This keeps me on the edge.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (8, 2):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Board state shows `.` at (8, 2). No enemy body there.\n    *   **Safety:** My body list shows `(8, 2)` is currently occupied by my 4th body segment. However, look at the turn order. My tail is currently at `(6, 6)`. When I move, my tail moves to `(7, 6)`.\n    *   **Reality Check:** The segment at `(8, 2)` will move to `(8, 3)` (connecting to the neck). So the space at `(8, 2)` will be vacated just in time for my head to arrive? **WAIT. NO.**\n    *   **Crucial Detail:** My body is `Head(9,2) -> (9,3) -> (8,3) -> (8,2)...`\n    *   If I go **LEFT** to `(8,2)`, I am moving into the cell currently occupied by my **4th body segment**. The tail moves, but the body segments shift. `(8,2)` is NOT the tail. It is a fixed body part that will shift forward. Moving into it is suicide.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**. \ud83d\udc80 Hitting myself.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nOkay, chat, this is a tricky spot. I'm pinned against the right wall at `(9,2)`. The only safe move is **DOWN**.\nWhy? Because **LEFT** is blocked by my own body (the segment at `(8,2)` won't move out of the way in time). **UP** is blocked by my neck `(9,3)`. **RIGHT** is a wall.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(9,1)`, I survive. I will be at `(9,1)`.\nFrom `(9,1)`, my options next turn will be:\n*   **LEFT to (8,1):** Currently `.` (Safe).\n*   **DOWN to (9,0):** Currently `A` (Apple! Safe).\n*   **UP to (9,2):** Will be empty (my tail moves).\n\nGoing **DOWN** keeps me on the edge but allows me to loop back around towards the bottom-left where the enemy is.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSurvive the edge. Move DOWN to `(9,1)`, then likely LEFT into the board at `(8,1)` or eat the apple at `(9,0)`. We need to get off the wall and start closing the distance on Snake #0.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nWe have no choice. We must go DOWN to survive and reposition.\n\nDOWN",

The tail moves away.\n    *   **Crucial Detail:** My current head is (9, 1). My current neck is (9, 2). Moving UP returns to (9, 2), which is the neck.\n    *   **Rule Check:** \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**. Hitting myself / Backwards move.\n\n2.  ** DOWN to (9, 0):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Board shows `A` (Apple). Enemy body is at x=1.\n    *   **Safety:** No walls, no enemy, no self.\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE & GROW**. High value.\n\n3.  ** LEFT to (8, 1):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Board shows `.` (Empty). Enemy is at x=1.\n    *   **Safety:** My body list does not contain (8, 1).\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE**.\n\n4.  ** RIGHT to (10, 1):**\n    *   **Obstacle:** Wall.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH**.\n\n** STRATEGIC EVALUATION: **\n*   ** Goal:** Win. Since I am leading 11-5, I do NOT want a head-on collision. I want to extend the lead and ensure survival.\n*   ** Option A (DOWN):** Moves me to (9, 0). I eat an apple, increasing my score to 12-5. This is a guaranteed growth. From (9, 0), I am pinned at the bottom-right corner. Next turn, I would likely have to go LEFT to (8, 0) or UP to (9, 1).\n*   ** Option B (LEFT):** Moves me to (8, 1). I do not eat an apple. From (8, 1), I have more freedom. I can go DOWN to (8, 0), LEFT to (7, 1), or UP to (8, 2).\n\n** DECISION:**\nGiven the 6-apple lead, securing a guaranteed apple is the safest play to build an insurmountable lead. It forces the enemy to play catch-up. While (9, 0) is a slightly more constrained position (corner), having an extra point is worth it. Furthermore, the enemy is currently at (1, 9) and moving towards the bottom-left apples. Moving to (9, 0) keeps me far away from immediate collision risks.\n\nI will take the apple at (9, 0).\n\nDOWN",

UP is off-board, DOWN would crash into your own neck.\n\nWHY LEFT: it grabs the apple at (0,9), grows you to 6, and starts a clean left-edge corridor play. RIGHT keeps you near the top open area but offers less confinement and less control over the ladder of escapes.\n\nOPPONENT DYNAMICS: enemy head is way across on the right (9,1); no immediate head-on collision risk this turn. A left-side push won\u2019t invite a sudden cross-path that traps you now.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: slide along the left wall to knit a corridor, force the enemy into forced choices later, and keep gaining apples to close the gap in score without sacrificing survival. The corner play buys you time while you chip away at their lead.\n\nON THIS TURN: I\u2019m taking LEFT to claim the left-edge apple and begin the corridor-box strategy.\n\nLEFT",

Can't go down from y=0.\n   - **DEAD** \ud83d\udc80\n\n3. **LEFT to (8, 0):**\n   - (8, 0) is EMPTY on the board (shows '.')\n   - Check my body: Does (8, 0) appear? My body segments: (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6)\n   - No (8, 0) in my body! \u2713\n   - Check enemy: Enemy is at x=1 on the left side, nowhere near (8, 0)\n   - **SAFE** \u2705\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 0):**\n   - Off the board! x=10 doesn't exist (max x=9)\n   - **DEAD** \ud83d\udc80\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nI literally only have ONE survivable move: LEFT to (8, 0). The board shows an apple at (5, 0) but I'm not heading for it directly - I'm just trying to survive and position myself strategically.\n\nMoving left keeps me on the bottom edge and opens up future moves to explore the bottom-left area where there's an apple at (5, 0). The enemy is currently in the top-left corner at (0,9), so they're far away from me. I have a 6-apple lead, so I should play it safe and keep my options open.\n\nLet me think ahead: From (8, 0), I'll be able to move DOWN? No, already at y=0. LEFT to (7, 0)? RIGHT back to (9, 0)? Or UP to (8, 1)? I'll have options, which is good.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Play conservatively to maintain my lead. Work my way toward the apple at (5, 0) on the bottom row. The enemy is distracted in the top-left, so I have breathing room. Focus on survival and incremental growth.\n\nLEFT",

If I go right, my tail will vacate (9,0) and I'll move into it - this is LEGAL! \ud83c\udf89\n   - **SAFE** \u2705 This is actually my NECK from last turn, but it's moving away!\n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\nI have TWO excellent options here: UP to (8, 1) or RIGHT to (9, 0). LEFT is also safe but less strategic.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9, 0):** This brings me back to where I just was! Not exciting, but it's safe and keeps me on the bottom row where there's an apple at (5, 0).\n- **UP to (8, 1):** This moves me UP into the board, opening access to the interior! I can see apples at (8, 1) is empty but (8, 2) has my body, (8, 3) has my body... actually this might get me trapped in my own coils!\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Looking at my body, I've created a vertical wall along x=9 and x=8 at y=1-6. If I go UP to (8, 1), I'm stepping into a space that's surrounded by my own body! (8, 2) and (9, 1) are both my body segments. This could trap me!\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:** RIGHT to (9, 0) is actually the smart play! Here's why:\n- It keeps me on the bottom edge (safe boundary)\n- I can work my way LEFT toward the apple at (5, 0)\n- I avoid getting boxed in by my own body\n- I maintain my position while the enemy is stuck in the top-left corner\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (9, 0) to stay safe, then work my way LEFT along the bottom row toward apple (5, 0). Keep the enemy pinned in the top-left while I maintain my 6-apple lead. Survive and grow!\n\nRIGHT",

UP would run straight into our neck, LEFT is off-board, RIGHT is into our own body. DOWN to (0,7) is the only safe move.\n\nReasoning: hugging the left edge buys space, avoids a risky head-on with the foe, and keeps flexible escape routes for future turns.\n\nLong-term plan: stay on the left wall this turn or two, bait the opponent into risky lines, chase apples only when it doesn\u2019t threaten survival, and look for a trap setup once we have smoother space to maneuver.\n\nMove decision: DOWN\n\nDOWN",
