Let's look at distances to apples from (2, 5) if I move UP:\n- Apple at (9, 8): |2-9| + |5-8| = 7 + 3 = 10 moves\n- Apple at (6, 7): |2-6| + |5-7| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves\n- Apple at (1, 5): |2-1| + |5-5| = 1 + 0 = 1 move\n- Apple at (6, 8): |2-6| + |5-8| = 4 + 3 = 7 moves\n- Apple at (7, 7): |2-7| + |5-7| = 5 + 2 = 7 moves\n\nThe apple at (1, 5) is very close - just one move away after I go UP. This is clearly my best option, especially since the enemy snake doesn't seem to be in a position to reach it before me.\n\n# Strategy\nI will move UP to position (2, 5). From there, I can move LEFT to collect the apple at (1, 5) on my next turn. After that, I'll plan my route to the apple cluster at (6, 7), (6, 8), and (7, 7).\n\nUP"
