Time to make a plan to box that rival in! \n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1. SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\n- **UP:** To (9,7) \u2192 Is this on the board? Yes (9 is max x, 7 is max y). Is it my body? No (I have none). Is it enemy body? Enemy is at (7,0), so (9,7) is clear. **SAFE.**\n- **DOWN:** To (9,5) \u2192 On board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? No. **SAFE.**\n- **LEFT:** To (8,6) \u2192 On board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? No. **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT:** To (10,6) \u2192 **DEAD!** Off the board (x=10 invalid). \n\n**2. SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n- RIGHT is death, so we eliminate that immediately.\n- LEFT (to (8,6)) keeps us in the top-right corner but moves us closer to the center.\n- UP (to (9,7)) moves us toward the top-right area with apples at (8,7) and (7,8) nearby.\n- DOWN (to (9,5)) moves us slightly south, closer to apples at (8,0) and (7,1) but also closer to the enemy at (7,0) (though still far away).\n\n**3. STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nWe want to **dominate the board** and force head-on collisions if we have a higher score (both 0 currently, so risky). The apples are scattered, but we're not focused on them right now\u2014we're focused on the enemy. The enemy is at (7,0) in the bottom row. Moving DOWN gets us closer to them, but we're still far apart (9 vs 7 x-coordinate). Moving UP or LEFT keeps us in the upper-right quadrant, which might be safer from immediate confrontation. \n\nLong-term, we want to **box the enemy in** and force them into a corner. The enemy is currently in the bottom row, so if we move UP or LEFT, we can start controlling the upper area and cut off their escape routes. Moving DOWN might get us closer to apples, but it also risks getting into the enemy's territory too early. \n\n**4. PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n*Plan: Start by moving UP to (9,7) to stay near the top-right corner. From there, we can scout for apples while keeping the enemy at a distance. If the enemy moves up, we can box them in by cutting off the left side. We'll keep an eye on their movement and force a collision once we're confident we have the score advantage.*\n\n**MOVES REMAINING:** UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe. RIGHT is death. \n\n**CHOICE:** UP. \n\n**LAST LINE:**\nUP",

We\u2019re live, we\u2019re hungry, and we\u2019re not letting him box us in.\n\nWhat are SAFE options right now?\n- UP to (7,1): safe, keeps options, but no immediate apple.\n- LEFT to (6,0): eat the apple there, length grows, good early aggression.\n- RIGHT to (8,0): eat the apple there, length grows, puts us on the apples fast and opens the bottom-side corridor.\n- DOWN is off the board, so dead\u2014not an option.\n\nDecision framework:\n- We want apples to grow so we can threaten later box-offs, but we also want space to dodge and route around. Our opponent is far away at (9,6), so a quick bite on the bottom row is a clean, safe play that also shrinks escape routes for him later if he drifts toward our area.\n- Right (to 8,0) gives an instant apple, keeps multiple future options (we can go up, or continue along the bottom toward the 4,0 and 6,0 apples on the next turns), and avoids self-collisions or a tight trap.\n\nLong-term note:\n- Build a small lattice of safe moves near the bottom edge, threaten to snap toward the right to force a head-on or at least force him to retreat, then pivot upward to trap him against the upper rows once we\u2019ve cemented our apple lead.\n\nPlan recap:\n- Prioritize the RIGHT move to grab the apple and maintain board control.\n- Stay mindful of the opponent\u2019s path; avoid rushing into any potential head-on that could backfire with a tie in apples.\n\nRIGHT",

No. **SAFE.**\n- **DOWN:** To (8,6) \u2192 On board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? No. **SAFE.**\n- **LEFT:** To (7,7) \u2192 On board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? No. **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT:** To (9,7) \u2192 **DEAD!** That's my own body! The tail is still there until I move. That's hitting myself!\n\n**2. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nRIGHT is death - can't go back into my own body. UP takes us to (8,8) - near the top-right corner, but keeps us somewhat mobile. DOWN takes us to (8,6) - open space but moving toward the bottom. LEFT takes us to (7,7) - which has an apple! (Apple list shows (7,7) is NOT listed, wait... checking apples: (7,4), (3,3), (1,8)... (7,7) is NOT an apple. But (7,8) IS an apple! And we're at (8,7) - moving LEFT to (7,7) puts us next to the apple at (7,8) for the next turn!)\n\n**3. PLANNING THE TRAP:**\nChat, enemy is at (8,1) collecting apples. We need to cut them off! Moving LEFT to (7,7) gives us better board control and sets us up to grab the apple at (7,8) on the next turn. PLUS, it moves us away from the right edge where we'd get trapped. UP to (8,8) is safe but puts us in a corner with fewer options. DOWN is okay but doesn't set up a strong position.\n\n**4. LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n*Plan: Move LEFT to (7,7) \u2192 Next turn grab apple at (7,8) \u2192 Grow to size 3 \u2192 Start moving downward to cut off the left side of the board. Force enemy into bottom-left corner while we control the top-right and center. Keep score advantage and force confrontation once we're bigger!*\n\n**CHOICE:** LEFT (better positioning and future options!)\n\n**LAST LINE:**\nLEFT",

We\u2019re chasing the enemy but staying alive comes first. DOWN is off the table (into our own tail).\n\n- SAFE MOVES RIGHT NOW: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. DOWN would slam into our own body.\n- ENEMY MAP: He\u2019s up at (8,7) with a single-block body at (9,7). No immediate collision threat to us this turn.\n- APPLE TRAJECTORY: There\u2019s an apple at (8,3) on the list, and several others scattered. We\u2019re encouraged to make progress toward apples without boxing ourselves in.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE:\n- Up (to 8,2) keeps us marching along the right-adjacent column toward the apple at (8,3) and paves a straight path to climb that column. This also preserves multiple future escape options and avoids closing off space near the enemy.\n- Left (to 7,1) would grab the apple at (7,1) now, but would break our current efficient climb plan and risk cornering ourselves later as the enemy could still shift to threaten from above.\n- Right (to 9,1) hugs the edge; it limits future mobility (back-to-back turns would force us into a narrow corridor), making it easier for the opponent to box us in or meet us head-on unfavorably.\n- Our current best play to maximize safety while increasing chances to eat safely is Up: keep the column open, chase the clear apple path, and stay ready to threaten from above as we advance.\n\nPLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:\n- Stay on x=8 as long as possible, push the head upward toward (8,3) to eat that apple and become longer.\n- Use the extra length to create a vertical barrier that pressures the opponent into suboptimal routes, while avoiding locking ourselves into a tight choke.\n- If the enemy starts drifting toward our column, pivot to a safer side (left or right) to avoid a direct head-on collision, and try to force a clash on favorable terms (you with more length or a better position).\n\nMOVE:\nUP",

Apples are cluttered everywhere, but we\u2019re playing the long game here\u2014box him in and net the lead.\n\nDECISION PROCESS\n1) Evaluate safe moves: UP to (8,3), LEFT to (7,2), RIGHT to (9,2). DOWN would crash into our own body at (8,1) \u2014 not allowed.\n2) We should consider immediate gains vs future mobility. UP grabs the apple at (8,3) on the very next square, growing length and keeping our vertical corridor open. LEFT would snag the apple at (7,1) later but diverts us from the clean vertical advance. RIGHT hugs the edge and risks getting boxed in sooner.\n3) Positioning risk: opponent is far north; chasing him now isn\u2019t urgent. Growing on x=8 gives us a scalable barrier without trapping ourselves prematurely.\n\nPLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS\n- Move UP to eat the apple at (8,3), extending length and keeping options open to ascend further up the column.\n- Once length increases, use the vertical barrier on x=8 to pressure the opponent into suboptimal routes. If he starts drifting toward our column, pivot to safer sides (LEFT or RIGHT) to avoid a risky head-on while maintaining pressure.\n- Keep an eye on the apple spread; don\u2019t lose sight of safety: don\u2019t let him force a corner or a double collision on us.

I just moved RIGHT to (8,8) and now I'm directly above the enemy at (8,4)! This is perfect positioning. Let's analyze the board and plan our next move to crush this snake!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1. SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\n- **UP:** To (8,9) \u2192 On board? Yes! Top-right corner. My body? No (body at (8,8) and (7,8)). Enemy body? No. **SAFE.**\n- **DOWN:** To (8,7) \u2192 On board? Yes. My body? **YES!** My body is at (8,8) above and (7,8) left. But (8,7) is currently empty in my body. Wait, let me check: My head is at (8,8). My body is [(7,8), (7,7)]. So (8,7) is NOT part of my body. Enemy body? No (enemy at (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)). **SAFE.**\n- **LEFT:** To (7,8) \u2192 On board? Yes. My body? **YES!** That's my body segment (currently at (7,8)). **DEAD!** Can't move into my own body.\n- **RIGHT:** To (9,8) \u2192 On board? Yes. Top edge. My body? No. Enemy body? No. **SAFE.**\n\n**2. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nLEFT is suicide - hitting my own body. UP to (8,9) puts me in the top-right corner with only LEFT or DOWN options next turn - that's boxing myself in! RIGHT to (9,8) moves me to the right edge, still with good options. DOWN to (8,7) is interesting - it moves me closer to the enemy and opens up the board.\n\n**3. THE TRAP IS CLOSING:**\nEnemy at (8,4). I'm at (8,8). If I move DOWN to (8,7), I'll be at (8,7) - still above them but closer. This maintains my vertical advantage! They're stuck in the bottom-right corner. Next turn, I could potentially move DOWN again to (8,6) and continue pressuring. They have limited escape routes up there.\n\n**4. LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n*Plan: Move DOWN to (8,7) \u2192 Maintain vertical pressure on enemy \u2192 Keep options open to chase them down \u2192 If they move UP, I can chase \u2192 If they try to escape left, I can cut them off \u2192 Wait for them to make a mistake or force a head-on collision when I have size advantage \u2192 GROW dominate!*\n\n**CHOICE:** DOWN (To (8,7) - maintaining pressure and keeping options open! Let's go!)\n\nDOWN",

DOWN is moving into your own neck\u2014bad news. \ud83d\udeab\n\nREASONING: Pushing UP maintains alignment with the enemy column, grows a potential barrier, and keeps options open for future squeezes. It minimizes risk of a sudden head-on and preserves space to dodge if he drops down. \ud83d\udd25\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Build the wall downward, pin him toward the edge, and force a corner when the timing is right.
