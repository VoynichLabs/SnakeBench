Good to explore.\n\n- DOWN to (5,7): No snake, no apple.\n\n- LEFT to (4,8): Our body used to be at (4,8), is it safe now? The body's last segment was at (4,8) just before last move, but since we moved right, and didn't grow, the tail moves forward, so (4,8) is now free. So (4,8) is unoccupied (safe).\n\n- RIGHT to (6,8): Our own body is at (6,8). Moving there would be a collision with ourselves. Not safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- The cluster of apples on the right: (8,8), (8,6), (8,4) — generally up and right.\n\n- There's an apple at (7,9), which is up-right from us.\n\n- Moving UP to (5,9) gives the possibility to move right again toward (7,9) and (8,8).\n\n- Moving DOWN takes us away from those apples, not optimal.\n\n- Moving LEFT is a fallback move, but conflicts with the plan since it brings us back towards previous positions.\n\nPlan:\n\n- Move UP to (5,9), opening access toward (7,9) apple.\n\n- Next turn after moving UP, consider moving RIGHT again toward (7,9) then (8,8).\n\nPotential danger:\n\n- Enemy snake is at (3,5) and (3,4), well removed from our path, so no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, move UP.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving UP, re-assess situation and move RIGHT toward apples at (7,9) and (8,8).\n\nNext move: UP",

Although safe, it doesn’t create a clear path to an apple quickly.\n\n• RIGHT would move our head into (3,5). This choice is appealing because, on our next moves, we’ll have an opportunity to head down (especially once our tail moves) toward the apple at (3,1). After moving RIGHT, our snake’s body will update by shifting the older parts as the tail recedes, likely freeing up (3,4) so we can safely maneuver downward later.\n\nWith safety, board position, and apple pursuit in mind, my decision is to steer closer toward the nearest apple by moving RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT.",

Moving there would mean collision with ourselves, unsafe.\n\n- RIGHT to (8,9):\n\n  - Checking the board:\n\n    - (8,9) is empty (no mark), safe.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\nBut (8,8) is the apple, and to get there, possible path is:\n\n- Move RIGHT to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8), or\n\n- Move DOWN to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8).\n\nBetween these two, moving DOWN first is safer because the enemy is on the left side and won't interfere, and the path DOWN then RIGHT avoids any edge or risk.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT to (8,9) is safe, but from there, next move DOWN to (8,8) may be better or worse depending on surroundings (we'll check below).\n\nLet's check the positions around (8,9):\n\n- UP (8,10): off board.\n\n- DOWN (8,8): apple present, ideal.\n\n- LEFT (7,9): our current head position, would be backward and collide with body; can't go backwards.\n\n- RIGHT (9,9): marked as '.' safe.\n\nSo moving RIGHT first and then DOWN to get the apple at (8,8) is a good plan.\n\nAlternative is DOWN first to (7,8):\n\n- (7,8) is clear.\n\n- From (7,8), next moves:\n\n  - UP to (7,9): just came from there, body is still there, so not safe.\n\n  - DOWN to (7,7): is it free? It appears free.\n\n  - LEFT to (6,8): body currently occupies (6,8).\n\n  - RIGHT to (8,8): apple.\n\nFrom (7,8), moving RIGHT to (8,8) would get the apple quickly.\n\nSo:\n\n- Move DOWN to (7,8)\n\n- Then RIGHT to (8,8)\n\nThat path gets us the apple quicker potentially without risk.\n\nWe need to avoid going backward onto our own body.\n\nTesting if going DOWN to (7,8) is safe: yes, no body there.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate move is DOWN to (7,8).\n\nStrategy after that is to move RIGHT to (8,8) to get the apple.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Move DOWN to (7,8)\n\n- Then RIGHT to (8,8)\n\nThis also opens the possibility to continue to the other apples around (8,6) and (8,4).\n\n**Decided move: DOWN**",

That move doesn’t contribute to our goal and drifts away from the apple.\n\n• Moving RIGHT would reverse our last move (going from (4,2) to (5,2)), which is not permitted as that cell is still part of our body and would result in self-collision.\n\nThus, continuing in the leftward direction not only avoids danger but positions us on a path toward the accessible apple at (0,2).\n\nMy next move is: LEFT.",

Let's verify:\n\nOriginal apples:\n\n- (0,7)\n- (3,8)\n- (9,8)\n- (4,8)\n- (1,9)\n\nAfter our last move UP to (5,8), you haven't eaten an apple because there's none at (5,8). Are any apples eaten? If so, which?\n\nApples left listed last turn: (0,7), (3,8), (0,2), (9,8), (4,8)\n\nWait, in the apple list from last turn there's an extra apple at (0,2) that was not mentioned in the initial list.

No apple there. So it's open.\n\n- DOWN to (5,7) → your body is at (5,7); going backward kills you, so no.\n\n- LEFT to (4,8) → There is an apple at (4,8).

DOWN to (2,7):\n   - Within board.\n   - No obstacles.\n   - Could work as an alternative path toward (0,7) apple.\n\nEvaluating these moves:\n\n- Cannot go RIGHT (would be backward into body).\n- Between LEFT, UP, and DOWN, LEFT gets us closer to the (0,7) apple which is directly left and down-left diagonal.\n- However, moving LEFT to (1,8), then potentially DOWN to (1,7), then LEFT to (0,7) is a straightforward route to apple at (0,7).\n- The apple at (1,9) lies above, so UP to (2,9) would bring us closer but farther from (0,7).\n- Since (0,7) is a low-hanging apple and closer, it makes sense to continue focusing on it first.\n\nIs moving LEFT to (1,8) safe?\n\n- No enemies occupy (1,8).\n- Our body is at: [(2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3)] — so (1,8) is not part of the body.\n- Board bounds are respected.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is a good move to approach the (0,7) apple.\n\n**Next move strategy**: Continue toward (0,7) apple by moving LEFT and DOWN as needed, then after eating it, head UP toward (1,9) apple. Keep scanning for enemy movement to avoid potential blocking.\n\nMy next move: LEFT",

Move DOWN to (1,8):\n   - Our own body occupied this last turn at (1,8).\n   - However, since snake grows at head, tail should move forward unless eaten apple.\n\n   We can confirm if (1,8) is now free. Since we just grew at (1,9), the tail will not move this turn.\n\n   The snake body at (1,8) might still be occupied, so moving DOWN is illegal onto ourselves.\n\n3.

Move UP to (1,10):\n   - Out of board: invalid.\n\nSo the feasible safe moves are LEFT to (0,9) or RIGHT to (2,9).\n\nBetween LEFT and RIGHT:\n\n- LEFT (0,9) edges us closer to apple at (0,7) and enemy snake #1.\n- Enemy snake is at (0,7) with body segments down to (1,2).\n- Our risk of collision with enemy head at (0,7) if they move toward apple at (0,7) is high.\n\n- RIGHT (2,9) takes us further away from enemy snake and closer to center. Also, can later approach apples at (4,6), (6,6), and eventually to (9,8).\n\nGiven this, safer and better strategy is to move RIGHT to (2,9) to avoid confrontation and open path to other apples.\n\nNext turn strategy:\n\n- From (2,9), move down gradually to (4,6) apple.\n- Avoid enemy snake near (0,7).\n\nTherefore, move RIGHT.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**",

That corridor looks too narrow and risky.  \n\n• RIGHT from (0,7) brings us to (1,7), which is completely open. From (1,7) we have additional lateral and downward options that can help us maneuver around the enemy barrier on row 8 while keeping an eye on the available apples at (9,8), (6,6), (4,6), (9,2), and (8,0).  \n\n• DOWN would result in moving onto our own body (at (0,6)) and LEFT is off the board.\n\nGiven this analysis, moving RIGHT to (1,7) gives us better flexibility to dodge enemy segments and eventually make our way toward an apple (likely through a more central route).\n\nTherefore, our next move is: RIGHT.",

Let's see body parts.\n  \nOur recent body, after moving right to (2,9), would be:\n\n- Head: (2,9)\n- Body: [(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nSo the snake moved its head to (2,9), tail moved forward unless we ate an apple last turn.\n\nSince no apple was at (2,9), the tail probably moved, freeing up previous tail's position. The tail was at (5,5) last time, which will move forward. This means (3,9) might be free now.\n\nIs (3,9) free?\n\nYes, (3,9) was head before we moved to (2,9), so the tail must have shifted forward, meaning positions like (3,8) and so are still occupied, but (3,9) should be free.\n\nIs (3,9) occupied by the body? We see (3,8) is body but not (3,9). The enemy and board don’t have anything at (3,9).\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (3,9) seems safe.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- UP: invalid\n- LEFT: collision with body\n- DOWN: collision with body\n- RIGHT: safe, open\n\nMoving RIGHT is best to stay alive and move towards apples at (4,6) and (6,6).\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (3,9), move DOWN gradually towards apples at (4,6) or (6,6).\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT",

(Note that though the enemy snake’s body appears on row 6 at (5,6), that is to its right of the apple, so we’d be safely away from it if we approach from the left.)\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (1,5) is safe, but that would take us further from the apple(s) we want—especially the particularly tempting apple at (4,6). It would be less efficient for our game plan.\n\nSince our goal is to get points by grabbing apples and the RIGHT move directly supports that strategy while offering clear space, our decision is to move RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT.",

So that apple is occupied at the moment.\n\nYour body now is this, including the new head position: [(6,8), (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8)] — actually, the exact body segments depend on the tail's movement, but assuming you didn't eat an apple last turn, the tail moved forward, so your body preserved length.\n\nLet's check the surrounding squares from (6,8):\n\n- UP: (6,9), this was your previous head position before moving down, so moving UP would be moving backward, which is invalid.\n- DOWN: (6,7)\n- LEFT: (5,8)\n- RIGHT: (7,8), which was your previous position too, so potentially backward? Wait, your last head was (6,8), the previous turn head was (6,9). You just moved DOWN from (6,9) to (6,8).\n\nTherefore, from (6,8):\n\n- Moving UP to (6,9) is moving backward, invalid.\n- LEFT to (5,8): (5,8) is your body, so invalid.\n- RIGHT to (7,8): (7,8) is the position you were at previously, but is it your body now? Given that you moved down, and your tail moved forward, positions might have changed. But let's be cautious: Because your body includes (7,8), so right is probably blocked.\n- DOWN to (6,7): Is this free?\n\nCheck if (6,7) is occupied by either your body or enemy:\n\nEnemy snake occupies (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), etc., but not (6,7).\n\nYour body does not include (6,7).\n\nSo moving DOWN to (6,7) is free and is closer to apple at (6,6) (one step down).\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN again towards the apple at (6,6) seems best.\n\nStrategy:\n\n- Continue moving DOWN towards (6,6) to try and contest or eat the apple there.\n- After reaching or missing that apple, move towards the cluster at the top right (9,8), (9,9).\n- Avoid moving backward or into your own body.\n\nDecided move: DOWN",
