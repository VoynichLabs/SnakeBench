The optimal strategy to grab the closest apples involves moving up. By moving UP from (7,2), we will reach (7,3) and capture the apple positioned there. The next logical move afterward would be to move RIGHT to (8,3) to gather the next apple, considering there are no other snakes or body blocks nearby threatening that path.\n\nCurrent move strategy rationale:\n- Moving UP first allows us to grab the apple at (7,3) safely without any encounters.\n- After this move, next planning would involve capturing the next apple at (8,3).\n\nTherefore, the decided move this turn will be: UP."

Moving LEFT towards (6, 4) decreases the distance to this apple but approaches the position of enemy Snake #1, which could be risky if that snake decides to also reach for the same apple.\n   - Moving UP has no imminent apple rewards but provides a safer path and more flexibility for future moves towards the apples at (3, 8).\n\n4. **Enemy Snake Considerations**:\n   - Snake #1's presence near (6, 2) requires cautious navigation around the lower central part of the board to avoid potential traps or confrontation.\n\n5. **Strategic Considerations**:\n   - Considering the longevity and increasing body length, maintaining an option-rich position is important. Moving UP gives the snake the option to later move either left or right more safely, possibly allowing access to more space and subsequently to more apples.\n   - Avoiding a dense concentration of snake bodies, especially our own, will be crucial in shedding the dual risks of self-collision and enemy entrapment.\n\n**Next Move Decision**:\nGiven the need for safety, flexibility, and longer-term strategic positioning for apple acquisition, moving UP would be the most advantageous move.

A clear, though long, path involving strategic left direction moves could prove beneficial in chasing these apples.\n\n**Enemy Snake Proximity:**\n- Snake #1 is located at (5, 1). It poses little immediate threat provided we decide against extensive downwards or leftward movement.\n\n**Preferred Strategy Going Forward:**\n- Positioning ourself in the upper regions away from the enemy snake while simultaneously angling toward the left side of the board loaded with apples is strategic. This will necessitate evolving our direction from rigidity to a more adaptive pattern depending on enemy movements and apple renewals.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, moving **UP** to (7, 7) seems to be the safest immediate action, allowing for further assessment next turn while avoiding danger and conserving space for future strategic decisions.\n\n**Decided next move: UP**"

The vertical center of the board offers a balanced approach to reach further apples at (4, 6), (5, 3), and (5, 0).\n- I must maintain flexibility in my movement and not get cornered by the boundaries or enemy snake.\n\n**Decided next move:** **LEFT** to secure the apple at (3, 8) and strengthen position on the board."

LEFT to (1, 0): Safe move, moving toward the left side of the board\n2. RIGHT to (3, 0): Safe move, moving toward the apple at (5, 0)\n3. UP to (2, 1): UNSAFE - this would hit my own body segment\n4.
