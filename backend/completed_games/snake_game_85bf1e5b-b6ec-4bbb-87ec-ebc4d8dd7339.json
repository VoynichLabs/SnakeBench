DOWN \u2192 (8, 6)\n- My own body/segment \u2014\u00a0since I just ate an apple, the tail did **not** move, so (8, 6) is still occupied. Unsafe. Don't go DOWN.\n\n#### 3. LEFT \u2192 (7, 7)\n- Open.\n- No apple, but gives me more central control.\n- Potentially safer; moving toward open board, not against a wall.\n\n#### 4. RIGHT \u2192 (9, 7)\n- Open.\n- Next to rightmost wall \u2014\u00a0only way out would be DOWN or UP after, but doesn't box me in immediately.\n- No apple.\n\n### Next Closest Apple?\n\n- **(9, 2):** Down and right \u2014 quite far.\n- **(6, 0):** Far left bottom \u2014\u00a0distant.\n- **(4, 6):** Left and down a bit \u2014\u00a0possibly on the way.\n- All apples are not a quick reach; need to start migrating toward the next one instead of boxing in on the edge.\n\n#### What About \"RIGHT\" or \"UP\"?\n\nMoving UP to (8, 8) or RIGHT to (9, 7) keeps me close to the wall \u2014 but there\u2019s no immediate apple or threat, so either is \"safe\", but start to limit options. LEFT is probably best for mobility and planning ahead.\n\n#### What About \"LEFT\"?\n\nMoving to (7, 7) gives maximum board to maneuver and opens paths toward the apple at (4, 6) or just keeping fully mobile.\n\n### Path Toward Next Apple\n\n- If I go LEFT to (7, 7), I can then continue LEFT/ DOWN toward (4, 6), or migrate toward the left/lower board.\n- I want to avoid the top right corner because the next apple isn't there.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Best move is LEFT to (7, 7)** \u2014\u00a0most mobility, heads toward next apple, avoids boxing myself in on the right, and keeps my options open.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy note for myself:**  \nStart heading toward the apple at (4, 6) or get closer to board center. Watch out for my own tail, since after this move, my full body trail is:  \nHead (7, 7), body: (8, 7), (8, 6)  \n(so avoid moving back into (8, 7), unless tail vacates).\n\n---\n\n**My move:**  \n**LEFT**"

Better to start converging toward a target.\n\n## Deciding\n\nBetween LEFT and DOWN, both are equivalently safe, but DOWN puts me on the same row as the apple at (4, 6), so I can sneak toward it next turn using LEFTs, which gives me flexibility: if an enemy approaches from the left, I can drop down toward (6, 0) and stay away from danger. Also, being off the top edge is better for future maneuvering.\n\n## Final answer\n\n**Move: DOWN**\n\n---\n\n### Strategy Note\n\n**Start sliding left across row 6 toward the apple at (4, 6).

No immediate apple, but safe, moves me lower.\n- **LEFT = (6, 6):** Open. This is toward apple at (4, 6). **This is the direct path to the apple!**\n- **RIGHT = (8, 6):** Occupied by own body \u2014 NOT SAFE.\n\nSo, only DOWN and LEFT are available.\n\n---\n\n## Evaluating the Options\n\n### LEFT (to 6, 6)\n- **Advantages:**\n    - Puts me one step closer to the nearest apple at (4, 6).\n    - It's a clear shot: from (6, 6) I can go to (5, 6) and then (4, 6) to reach the apple in two more moves.\n    - My own body can't get in the way, because I'm not circling back this way.\n    - Many options still available afterward: UP to (6, 7) (safe); DOWN to (6, 5) (open); LEFT again.\n- **Risks:** None seen; enemy is far away; not near a wall.\n\n### DOWN (to 7, 5)\n- **Advantages:**\n    - Still safe, not near a wall.\n    - Keeps options open in the central rows.\n- **Disadvantages:**\n    - Doesn't get me closer to any apple quickly.\n    - Wastes a move, and since snake is long-ish, I want to avoid getting too close-packed.\n\n---\n\n## What's Best?\n\nMy **top strategic objective** is to get to apples as quickly and safely as possible. Since (4, 6) is closest \u2014 and LEFT is open \u2014 and no snake (including myself) is blocking, I should move LEFT now, then continue left to the apple.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- Enemy is not a threat anywhere near.\n- LEFT is open and fastest to apple.\n- Risk of self-collision is zero.\n- Strategy: Continue toward (4, 6), then see about lower apples once that one is consumed.\n\n---\n\n**Move: LEFT**\n\n---\n\n### Strategy Reminder to Self\n\nOn next turn, continue LEFT unless something changes. My escape options (DOWN, UP) remain open, and apple is just 2 moves away.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \n**LEFT**"

So, I just spawned here or just ate.)\n- Apples: (8, 6), (9, 2), (8, 7), (4, 6), (7, 3)\n- Enemy Snake: \n    - Head at (6, 2) with body at [(6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0)]\n- The enemy is in the lower middle; not near me.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Legal Moves**\n\nCurrent position: **(5, 7)**\n- **UP:** (5, 8) -- inside board and unoccupied\n- **DOWN:** (5, 6) -- inside board and unoccupied\n- **LEFT:** (4, 7) -- inside board and unoccupied\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 7) -- inside board and unoccupied\n\nNo risk of hitting myself (I have no body yet) or any snake (enemy is far away).\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Which move gets me closest to an apple?**\n\nLet's look for the nearest apples:\n\n### Distances from (5, 7):\n\n- (8, 6): |8-5| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = **4**\n- (9, 2): |9-5| + |2-7| = 4 + 5 = **9**\n- (8, 7): |8-5| + |7-7| = 3 + 0 = **3**\n- (4, 6): |4-5| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = **2** (**Closest!**)\n- (7, 3): |7-5| + |3-7| = 2 + 4 = **6**\n\n**(4, 6)** is nearest (distance 2); also **(8, 7)** is quite close (distance 3) and **(8, 6)** as well (distance 4).\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Path to nearest apple (4, 6)**\n\n- From (5, 7): \n    - LEFT to (4, 7), then DOWN to (4, 6) = reach apple in 2\n    - Or DOWN to (5, 6), then LEFT to (4, 6) = same\n\nSo, both LEFT and DOWN move me 1 closer to (4, 6) and are equally good.\n\nAlternately, to get to (8, 7) in 3 moves: \n- RIGHT-RIGHT-RIGHT, all open.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Should I pick (4, 6) or (8, 7)?**\n\n**Pros for (4, 6):**\n- Closer\n- No competition (enemy snake can't get there at all soon \u2014 too far south)\n- Safe\n\n**Pros for (8, 7):**\n- May beat me there if apple cluster at east gets busy later, but right now, nearest snake is only me.\n\n**If I go LEFT to (4, 7):**\n- Can reach (4, 6) next turn; in great shape to eat it.\n\n**If I go RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n- Sets up for (8, 7), possibly a longer run with more potential apples in east. But why skip the 2-move, uncontested (4, 6)?\n\n---\n\n## 6. **What are my risk levels?**\n\n- No threats nearby\n- No walls on any side (I'm in center-top)\n- No way to be trapped by enemy soon\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Which direction this turn?**\n\n**LEFT** or **DOWN** both advance me 1 closer to (4, 6).\n\nWhich to pick? Let's check after moving:\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4, 7):  \n- Next turn, apple at (4, 6) is DOWN, and also puts me on left edge, not in a tight corner, and above apple.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5, 6):  \n- Next turn, apple at (4, 6) is LEFT, and it\u2019s still good.\n\nAre there any differences in future options?  \nAt (4, 7), after picking up (4, 6), I\u2019ll be at (4, 6) with body at [(4, 7)] next. After eating apple, both (5, 6) (RIGHT), (4, 5) (DOWN), (3, 6) (LEFT) will be free.\n\nOK, both are good, but **LEFT** feels slightly better to avoid clustering directly above the apple in case something shifts. Being two columns in from the edge gives slightly more escape options.\n\n**Alternatively**, maybe **DOWN** is better because then my path east stays more open (if I want to go for (8, 6) or (8, 7)), since the path to LEFT often has more walls.\n\nBut with all options open, and as the contest for (4, 6) is zero, I\u2019ll stick with **LEFT** \u2014 go to (4, 7), then DOWN to apple.\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Strategy for next turn**\n\n- If the apple at (4, 6) is still there, take it.\n- If someone grabs it, switch target to (8, 7) by moving RIGHT.\n- Keep an eye on enemy position, but currently they are not a threat.\n- Plan path so I don\u2019t get boxed in after a few apple pickups; try to snake back toward the eastern apples.\n\n---\n\n**My move:**  \n**LEFT** (to (4, 7))\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nIf apple at (4, 6) is still there, go DOWN. If apple is gone, go toward (8, 7) or (8, 6), favoring open safe paths.\n\n---\n\n**Final direction:**  \n**LEFT**"

(8, 6) is 4 steps, (8, 7) is 5, so **(8, 6) is best.**\n\n## 5. **Safety Check**\n\n- Enemy is at (7, 3), so no immediate threat on the rightward path.\n- All spaces between (4, 6) and (8, 6) are open except perhaps at (4, 7) (our tail, which will move away next turn).\n\n## 6. **Evaluate Each Move**\n\n- LEFT or DOWN: No apples, farther from targets.\n- UP: Could theoretically loop, but not towards an apple, and unnecessary right now.\n- RIGHT: Advances me towards (8, 6), the closest apple.\n\n## 7. **Consider Future Contests**\n\n- After moving RIGHT to (5, 6), still 3 steps from (8, 6).\n- Enemy is nowhere near; no contest for this apple.\n- Next turn, reassess in case enemy heads north, but at the moment, right is open.\n\n## 8. **Strategic Note for Myself Next Turn**\n\n- If enemy starts moving up, re-check path for conflicts.\n- Continue moving toward (8, 6) unless enemy or wall blocks path.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nMove **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n**Move:**  \nRIGHT\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:**  \nContinue progressing towards (8, 6), but watch for enemy position in case of contest.

Enemy can only threaten me if it comes north, but for now, no immediate danger\u2014they\u2019re several spaces away.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Apple Proximity Check**\n\nAvailable apples:\n- (8, 6)\n- (9, 2)\n- (8, 7)\n- (1, 8)\n- (5, 1)\n\n**Distances from (6,6):**\n- (8,6): 2 (RIGHT, RIGHT)\n- (8,7): 2 (UP, RIGHT, RIGHT)\n- (9,2): (3 right, 4 down) \u2014 far\n- (1,8): far\n- (5,1): far\n\nThe two closest are **(8,6)** and **(8,7)**.\n\n#### Which Direction is Best?\n- If I go **RIGHT**, I line up for (8,6) in 2 moves; can continue up to (8,7) after.\n- If I go **UP**, I go (6,7), then (7,7), then (8,7) for that apple\u2014but (8,6) will still be available unless enemy approaches it.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Are There Threats On The Way?**\n\n- **RIGHT:** (7,6) is open, (8,6) is apple. Enemy is two rows down and 2+ columns to the left, so cannot block.\n- **UP:** (6,7), (7,7), (8,7): all unoccupied.\n- **LEFT:** (5,6) \u2014 my own tail; but unless I just grew, should be safe.\n- **DOWN:** (6,5) \u2014 open.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Is There Reason to Deviate?**\n\n- Going RIGHT twice will get me (almost certainly) the apple at (8,6), unless enemy somehow races upwards much faster\u2014but they are at (8,2), can't reach in time.\n- Going UP sets up for the apple at (8,7), but it\u2019s farther (3 steps: UP, RIGHT, RIGHT vs RIGHT, RIGHT for (8,6)).\n- If I go UP, I'm still only one step away from returning to my RIGHT path if needed.\n- Only reason to go UP now is if I want to avoid potential congestion with the enemy, but the closest enemy is in the lower right quadrant.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Strategic Note**\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,6), I\u2019ll have more length and can safely go UP to (8,7) for the next apple. This is a nice \u201cchain\u201d of apples in the northeast. Always keep checking if the enemy might cut me off as I get closer to the northern/western walls.\n\n---\n\n## **Decision:**\n\n- **RIGHT** is the optimal choice: gets me one step closer to (8,6) quickly and safely.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** If I eat the apple at (8,6), consider heading UP immediately to (8,7) apple. Keep scanning for enemy snake movement up the right edge.\n\n---\n\n**MOVE:**  \n**RIGHT**"

(Just moved from here) \u2014 **Unsafe! Moving left would crash**\n\n- **Enemy #0:**\n    - Head at (8,4)\n    - Body at [(8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3)]\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Apple Analysis**\n\n- Apples remaining: (9,2), (8,7), (1,8), (5,1), **(3,2)**\n- (8,7) is directly UP from my current head (8,6). This is a great opportunity for another apple!\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Threat/Enemy Review**\n\n- Enemy is below, at (8,4), no immediate collision risk; needs at least 2 turns to get to my row.\n- All moves except LEFT are safe vis-a-vis my body and the snake.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Best Move Analysis**\n\n- **UP (to 8,7):**\n    - Land directly on another apple and GROW again.\n    - Puts me at (8,7), which is not a wall (since range is up to 9).\n    - Still safe from enemies.\n\n- **RIGHT (to 9,6):**\n    - Empty, no apple, progressing towards wall DOUBLES up on right side, may limit future moves.\n    - After that, can only go UP or DOWN before hitting the wall.\n\n- **DOWN (to 8,5):**\n    - Empty; but moving away from apples.\n    - No strategic gain.\n\n- **LEFT:**\n    - Into own body, would crash. ILLEGAL.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Short-term Strategy After This Move**\n\n- After eating the second apple at (8,7), I'll need to assess nearby opportunities:\n    - **LEFT (7,7)**: available and open\n    - **RIGHT (9,7)**: towards the edge, but possible if safe\n    - **UP (8,8)**: possible, approaching the top but no apple ahead, so maybe not optimal\n\n- **No immediate threats nearby**, but if I go UP, I\u2019ll want to avoid cornering myself on the right edge.\n- Primary apples remaining left on the right side: (9,2), a possible longer-term goal after (8,7), if the path is open.\n\n---\n\n## **CONCLUSION**\n\n- **Move UP (to 8,7),** eat second apple, grow again, no threat of attack or collision.\n- Afterward: Decide between moving left (7,7), right (9,7), or up (8,8) based on how the enemy moves and apple locations.\n\n---\n\n**MOVE:** UP\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nAfter (8,7), consider avoiding being squeezed against the right wall. Evaluate board to see if shifting left provides more flexibility and approach additional apples while monitoring enemy movement below.\n\n---\n\n**MOVE:** UP"

No expansion in options.\n- **RIGHT (9,8)**: Pushes into the corner, away from apples, with future path-walls risks.\n- **LEFT (7,8)**: Keeps all doors open, pursues (1,8), allows me to stay central and flexible for next apples.\n\n**LEFT is optimal.**\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Next Turn Strategy**\n\n- After moving LEFT to (7,8), continue left to (6,8), etc., toward (1,8).\n- Reassess if enemy starts moving up or blocks (9,2), in which case prioritize safety over apples.\n- Keep my future path open: don't hug the edges unless collecting an apple there.\n\n---\n\n## **CONCLUSION**\n\n**MOVE:** LEFT\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nContinue toward (1,8) for the apple, but always check enemy and my own path safety.
