We are BACK in the arena and it is time to establish dominance! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Look at the board\u2014the enemy (Snake #1) is way up at (4, 9) while we are chilling at (9, 1). He\u2019s got the high ground? Please! He\u2019s isolated up there and we\u2019ve got plenty of room to operate!\n\n**THE INTEL:**\n- **Current Position:** (9, 1). We are right near the bottom-right corner.\n- **Enemy Position:** (4, 9). He\u2019s way across the map. No immediate threat of a head-on collision, but we need to start claiming space!\n- **The Plan:** We need to get big, and we need to get big FAST! There's an apple at (9, 6) and several in the (5, 0) to (8, 2) range. \n\n**CHECK THE SQUARES:**\n- **UP:** Moves us to (9, 2). Gets us closer to that apple at (9, 6). Safe!\n- **DOWN:** Moves us to (9, 0). Hugging the wall. Safe.\n- **LEFT:** Moves us to (8, 1). Moves us toward the cluster of apples at (8, 2) and (7, 0). Safe!\n- **RIGHT:** (10, 1)? NOPE! That\u2019s off the board! We aren't throwing the game on Turn 1, chat! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RATIONALE:** \nI want to move toward the center-bottom to snag those apples at (8, 2), (7, 3), and (7, 0). If we get thick, we can start cutting off his rotations to the bottom half of the board. I'm going UP first to keep my options open along the right wall before pivoting left! Let's bait him into thinking we're just going for the corner apple while we actually eye the center stage! \n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** \nTargeting (8, 2) and (9, 6) to build length. Once we have a body, we're going to create a \"no-go zone\" on the right side. Stay alert!\n\nUP",

Which sets us up best?  \n\nEnemy is far away bottom right. We want to control center, maybe push toward apples while cutting off his expansion.  \n\nDOWN to (4,8): puts us closer to several apples (2,8) and (4,7) but also closer to middle \u2014 good positioning.  \nLEFT to (3,9): edge of board, limits options next turn unless we go down/right after.  \nRIGHT to (5,9): similar to left but slightly more central.  \n\nI think DOWN gives us more flexibility \u2014 we stay near top but can go left/right/down next turn. Also gets us toward apples faster for early growth.  \n\nLong-term plan:  \n- Grow to 3-4 length quickly by grabbing nearby apples.  \n- Watch enemy movement pattern \u2014 if he moves up toward center, we can try to cut him off from top half.  \n- Use our body to shrink his safe space over time.  \n\nLet's go DOWN!  \n\nDOWN",

Our rival is at (4, 8) and you know he's eyeing these apples just as hard as we are! Who does he think he is?!\n\n**STAKING OUR CLAIM:**\nWe are currently at (9, 2). Let's look at the options to keep this momentum going:\n- **UP:** Moves us to (9, 3). This puts us closer to that juicy apple at (9, 6). It\u2019s safe and keeps us hugging the wall while we survey the land. \n- **DOWN:** Moves us to (9, 1). We just came from there! Why go backward? We aren't here to retreat, we're here to conquer! \ud83d\ude24\n- **LEFT:** Moves us to (8, 2). YO! There is an APPLE right there at (8, 2)! If we take this, we get our first point, we grow, and we start building that wall to box him out of the bottom-right corner!\n- **RIGHT:** (10, 2)? NO! Chasing ghosts off the board is a one-way ticket to a \"L\" in the chat. We stay on the grid!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nSnake #1 is way up at (4, 8). He might try to dive for the apple at (4, 7) or (2, 8). He's playing his game, let him. We are going to snag (8, 2) and then pivot to either (7, 3) or move up the 8-line. Getting that first apple is huge for the tie-breaker and gives us that extra segment to start posing a threat! We\u2019re going to be so long he won't even be able to breathe in this arena! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nSnag the apple at (8, 2) this turn! Then, we look to either head for (7, 3) or push up towards (9, 6). We need to maximize our size early so when we meet in the middle, we have the body length to trap him against the walls!

Apples everywhere but we're playing for control, not just snacks.\n\nLet's check moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (4,9): empty, safe \u2705  \nDOWN \u2192 (4,7): empty, safe \u2705  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,8): empty, safe \u2705  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,8): empty, safe \u2705  \n\nAll four moves safe! But which sets up pressure?\n\nEnemy is far bottom-right. If he moves UP toward (9,3), he's near apples at (8,2) and (7,3). We want to cut off his expansion toward the center.\n\nUP to (4,9): top edge, limits future moves unless we go down/left/right next turn. Not great for controlling space.  \nDOWN to (4,7): closer to apple at (4,7) \u2014 instant growth to length 2! That's content! But also puts us closer to middle, more options.  \nLEFT to (3,8): edge of board, fewer options.  \nRIGHT to (5,8): still top row, but more central than left.\n\nI think DOWN is strong \u2014 grab that apple, grow early, dominate center. But wait... if we grow, our tail stays at (4,8) for now, so our body blocks that space next turn. That could limit enemy movement later.\n\nBut also, enemy might move UP toward (9,3). If we go DOWN to (4,7), we're moving away from him \u2014 but that's fine, we're building length to outscore him for a future head-on clash.\n\nLong-term plan:  \n- Grow to length 2 now with apple at (4,7).  \n- Next turn, we'll have head at (4,7), tail at (4,8). From there, we can push left/right/down to control middle rows.  \n- Watch enemy: if he moves up, we can try to wall off top-right quadrant with our body over time.  \n- Force him toward edges where he'll trap himself.\n\nChat, what do you think?

Our rival snagged one too, so we are neck-and-neck at 1-1. But look at him, he's way up at (4, 7). He thinks he's safe? HE'S NOT READY FOR THE PRESSURE!\n\n**THE HUDDLE:**\nOur head is at (8, 2) and our tail is at (9, 2). Let's look at the map:\n- **UP:** Moves us to (8, 3). This is a POWER move! Look at the board\u2014the apple at (7, 3) is right there for the taking! It also puts us in a position to cut off the middle of the board.\n- **DOWN:** Moves us to (8, 1). There is an apple at (7, 0) and (5, 0), but going down pins us against the bottom wall early. We want to stay mobile!\n- **LEFT:** Moves us to (7, 2). This is safe, and (7, 3) is still close, but it's less aggressive than moving into the open space.\n- **RIGHT:** (9, 2)? THAT'S OUR OWN BODY, CHAT! We aren't trying to eat ourselves for the \"L\"! NO WAY!\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 7). He\u2019s likely going for (5, 6) or (4, 2). If we move UP to (8, 3), we are perfectly positioned to snatch the (7, 3) apple next turn. We need to grow FAST. The bigger we are, the more space we take away from him. If we can get to 4 or 5 segments while he's still small, we can start the BOX-IN strategy and force him to crash out! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udeab\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nWe are heading UP to (8, 3) to setup for the apple at (7, 3). From there, we can swing toward the center apples at (6, 3) or (5, 4). We need to maintain a presence in the middle-right of the board to prevent him from expanding into our territory. Let's keep the pressure high and the mistakes low! WE WANT THAT CROWN! \ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Both length 2 now.\n\nLet's check our moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (4,8): That's our own tail! But wait \u2014 tail moves after we move, so is it safe? YES! Because if we move UP, our head goes to (4,8), which is currently our tail, but the tail will move forward to (4,7) after we grow? Actually, we didn't eat an apple this turn, so we don't grow \u2014 tail stays at (4,8) until next turn. So moving UP into (4,8) is moving into our own body segment \u2014 that's DEAD. \u274c\n\nDOWN \u2192 (4,6): Empty, safe \u2705  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,7): Empty, safe \u2705  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,7): Empty, safe \u2705  \n\nSo UP is out. Three safe moves.\n\nNow think about enemy moves. He's at (8,2). Possible moves:  \nUP to (8,3) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nDOWN to (8,1) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nLEFT to (7,2) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nRIGHT to (9,2) \u2014 that's his own tail! Same logic \u2014 tail stays, so that's suicide \u274c  \n\nSo enemy likely avoids RIGHT. He might go UP toward apples at (7,3) or (6,3), or LEFT toward center.\n\nOur long-term plan: Box him in the bottom-right corner. We need to expand toward him while keeping escape routes for ourselves.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (4,6): moves us toward bottom, away from him \u2014 not aggressive.  \nLEFT to (3,7): moves us left, away from him \u2014 not putting pressure.  \nRIGHT to (5,7): moves us closer to center and slightly toward his side. From (5,7) we can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT next turn to cut off his northward expansion.\n\nAlso, apple at (5,6) is near (5,7) \u2014 next turn we could grab it if we go RIGHT then DOWN.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about head-on collision risk? If he goes LEFT to (7,2) and we go RIGHT to (5,7), no collision. If he goes UP to (8,3), still far. Low risk.\n\nRIGHT seems best \u2014 it advances our position toward the middle-right, sets up potential apple grabs, and starts cutting the board.\n\nChat, are we thinking too small? Should we be more aggressive and try to intercept his path? Let's lock in RIGHT \u2014 control the center, grow the snake, dominate the board! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

Let's look at our options for this turn:\n- **UP:** Moves us to (8, 4). There\u2019s an apple at (8, 7) way up there, but that\u2019s a long trek.\n- **DOWN:** (8, 2)? NOOOO! That\u2019s our own tail, Chat! We aren\u2019t trying to be a Ouroboros today. That's an instant L.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves us to (9, 3). This puts us right against the east wall. While it's safe, it limits our movement options for the next turn. We want to stay in the fight, not hug the fence!\n- **LEFT:** Moves us to (7, 3). **BINGO!** Look at the board, fam! There is an APPLE sitting right there at (7, 3)! If we take this, we grow to size 3 immediately. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**WHY LEFT IS THE PRO PLAY:**\nBy moving LEFT to (7, 3), we snag that apple. But look at the bigger picture\u2014the board is littered with apples in the (6, 3), (7, 4), and (5, 4) area. If we move left, we are moving directly into the \"Gold Mine\" zone. Our rival at (5, 7) is likely looking at the apples at (5, 6) or (6, 6). If we get big enough, we can start sweeping across the middle and cut his head off before he even knows what hit him! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nSnatch (7, 3) this turn. Then, we look at (7, 4) or (6, 3) depending on where Snake #1 lunges. We need to maintain a higher score so that if we ever choose to go head-to-head, we win the tie-break or provide more body for him to crash into. WE ARE PLAYING FOR KEEPS! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

That's DEAD \u274c  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6,7): Empty \u2705  \n\nSo LEFT is suicide.

Tail stays unless he eats apple \u2014 but no apple there, so that's suicide \u274c  \nLEFT to (7,3) \u2014 apple at (7,3)!

That puts us closer to bottom, near apples (6,6), (7,4), etc. But moving away from enemy? Not aggressive.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (6,7): Moves us right, closer to enemy side.

If we have longer snake, we can force head-on collisions later. Being longer means if we meet head-on, we win.\n\nAlso, apple at (5,6) is safe \u2014 enemy can't reach it this turn.\n\nSo DOWN gives us growth + score lead. Then next turn from (5,6) we can go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN to continue pressure.\n\nLong-term plan: Grow to gain length advantage, then push enemy toward edge. With length 3 vs his 2, we can be more aggressive in cutting off his moves.\n\nChat, let's take the apple, get bigger, and dominate! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

He might go for apples at (7,4) or (6,3).\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (6,6): We eat apple, grow to length 4, head at (6,6). That gives us a length advantage (4 vs 2). But we move closer to enemy? He's at (7,3), we'd be at (6,6) \u2014 not directly adjacent.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,5): Moves us away from apples, but keeps options open.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,6): Moves us left, near apple at (4,2) eventually.\n\nWe want to be aggressive \u2014 with length 3 vs 2, we can force head-on collisions and win. But we need to be smart about positioning.\n\nRIGHT to (6,6) eats apple, grows, and puts us in a strong central position. From (6,6) next turn we can go DOWN/LEFT/UP to pressure enemy.\n\nEnemy might go for (7,4) or (6,3). If he goes to (7,4), we're at (6,6) \u2014 not colliding this turn. If he goes to (6,3), we're at (6,6) \u2014 still safe.\n\nTaking the apple grows our lead. Longer snake = more board control. Let's secure that growth and then push him toward the edge!\n\nPlan for next turns: After eating apple at (6,6), aim to cut off his escape routes. He's in bottom-right area \u2014 we can slowly box him in by controlling center and left side.\n\nChat, let's take the apple, get bigger, and dominate! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2)]. \nRival Head: (6, 6). Body: [(5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7)].\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (7, 5). Safe! This moves us closer to the top-right apple at (9, 6) and keeps us parallel to the rival.\n- **DOWN:** (7, 3). **WATCH OUT!** That\u2019s our own body, Chat! We don't self-destruct for the clips! REJECTED! \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (8, 4). Safe! But it puts us closer to the wall. We want to keep the center open so we can maneuver.\n- **LEFT:** (6, 4). **BIG BRAIN ENERGY!** Look at the map! There\u2019s an apple at (5, 4) and (6, 3). Moving LEFT to (6, 4) puts us directly in his path. If he moves DOWN to (6, 5), we are staring him right in the soul! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**THE \"BOX-IN\" STRATEGY:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (6, 6). If we move **LEFT** to (6, 4), we are taking control of the x=6 column. We have the same score (3-3), so a head-on collision is a draw\u2014but we aren't here for draws, we're here for the DUB! By moving LEFT, we are cutting off his path to the bottom-center apples. We are building a wall and making HIM pay for it! He's cramped near the top-left; we need to keep him squeezed while we feast!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are going to pivot LEFT to (6, 4), then target the apple at (5, 4). This puts us right in the middle of the board, allowing us to react to any move he makes. If he tries to go for the apple at (3, 6), we\u2019ll be positioned to cut his tail off.

Score tied but we're longer (4 vs 3). That's an advantage! Enemy head at (7,4), body [(7,3), (8,3), (8,2)].\n\nCheck our moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (6,7): Empty \u2705  \nDOWN \u2192 (6,5): Empty \u2705  \nLEFT \u2192 (5,6): That's our own neck \u2014 moving backwards? That's DEAD \u274c  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7,6): Empty \u2705  \n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe. LEFT is suicide.\n\nNow predict enemy moves from (7,4):  \nUP to (7,5): Empty \u2705  \nDOWN to (7,3): His own neck \u2014 suicide \u274c  \nLEFT to (6,4): Empty \u2705  \nRIGHT to (8,4): Empty \u2705  \n\nHe can't go DOWN. He might go for apples? Closest apple to him is (9,5) up-right, (9,3) down-right, (8,7) far up. He might move toward those.\n\nWe want to be aggressive! With length 4 vs 3, we can force head-on collisions and win. But we must avoid giving him a free apple or letting him box us.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,6): Puts us closer to him horizontally, but not adjacent. From there we could threaten to cut off his upward movement.\n\nIf we go UP to (6,7): Moves us toward top-left, away from him \u2014 maybe too passive.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (6,5): Puts us near apple at (6,3)? Actually (6,3) is apple, but that's two steps down. Could be a future move.\n\nBut chat, think long-term! We want to dominate the center and push him toward the edge. He's in the right side. If we go RIGHT to (7,6), next turn we could go DOWN to (7,5) or RIGHT to (8,6) to pressure him. He might go UP to (7,5) \u2014 that could set up a potential head-on next turn if we both go to (7,5)? Wait, simultaneous moves \u2014 if we both target same cell, we both die. But we have longer body, so head-on collision means we win if scores tied? Actually head-on collision kills both regardless of length. But if we die simultaneously, winner is higher apples \u2014 tied right now. So avoid head-on unless we have apple lead.\n\nWe don't have lead yet. So avoid risky head-on.\n\nMaybe go DOWN to (6,5) to grab apple at (6,3) next turn? That grows our lead. But enemy might also go for (6,3) from (7,4) via LEFT then DOWN? He's two steps away.\n\nActually, apple at (6,3) is closer to us if we go DOWN now, then DOWN again to (6,4)? Wait, from (6,5) to (6,4) to (6,3) \u2014 two moves. He could go LEFT to (6,4) then DOWN to (6,3) \u2014 also two moves. Race!\n\nBut we have a more urgent goal: control the board. Let's go RIGHT to (7,6) to apply pressure, stay central, and keep options open. From (7,6) we can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT next turn.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving to (7,6), watch enemy's move. If he goes UP toward (7,5), we might go DOWN to (7,5) same time? Risky. Better to flank. Maybe next turn go DOWN to (7,5) only if he's not targeting it. We'll assess then.\n\nChat, we're playing to win, not just survive! Let's press the advantage! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

It's a dead heat, but we have better board positioning!\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP (6, 5):** **SENSATIONAL!** If we move UP to (6, 5), we are literally one square away from his head. If he moves LEFT to (6, 6) [wait, his body is at (6,6), so he can't!], or if he moves DOWN to (7, 5), we are practically breathing on him! \ud83d\ude24\n- **DOWN (6, 3):** This hits an apple! But wait\u2014if we go DOWN, we might get boxed into the bottom right corner by our own tail later. We want to be the one doing the boxing! \ud83e\udd4a\n- **LEFT (5, 4):** This also hits an apple! High value! (5, 4) is a great spot.\n- **RIGHT (7, 4):** **NO!** That's our own body. We don't do self-inflicted wounds on this channel!

His tail is at (5, 7), and his head is at (7, 6). If we move UP to (6, 5) and then LEFT/UP again, we can potentially circle around him.\n\nBut wait, look at the apple at (5, 4). If we go **LEFT** to (5, 4), we eat, we grow to size 5, and we stay flexible. If we go UP to (6, 5), we don't grow this turn. Snake #1 is at (7, 6).

If he moves DOWN to (7, 5), and we move UP to (6, 5), we are side-by-side.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're going **LEFT** to (5, 4). Why? Because it\u2019s an immediate power-up! We get the apple, we hit size 5, and we are still perfectly positioned to cut him off if he tries to escape the top-right quadrant. We are baiting him to come down into the mid-field where we have more room to maneuver. Once we're bigger, we'll use that length to wrap around his escape routes.

So he'll likely go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nWe need to be aggressive \u2014 but careful. Head-on collision kills both, and we're tied apples, so we'd both die and maybe draw. Not ideal.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (7,5): That puts us adjacent to his possible UP move to (6,5) \u2014 diagonal, not same cell.

But if we go LEFT is illegal... so maybe RIGHT is better to stay central and flexible.\n\nActually, let's think about his incentives: He might go for apple at (6,3) because it's closest. If he does, his tail will move, and his body will extend. We could use that to trap him later.\n\nBut we also have apple at (6,1) and others. We need to grow too!\n\nPlan: Go DOWN to (7,5). Why?  \n- It keeps us close to center.  \n- Next turn from (7,5), we can go DOWN to (7,4) \u2014 but that's his current body segment (7,4) \u2014 but he'll move, so maybe it'll be free.  \n- Or from (7,5) we can go LEFT to (6,5) to potentially block his upward movement if he goes UP.  \n- It also avoids moving into his possible path this turn (no head-on risk).\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,6), we're moving toward right wall \u2014 limits future options.\n\nUP to (7,7) is safe but away from action.\n\nSo DOWN seems smart \u2014 maintains pressure, stays near apples, and keeps options open.\n\nChat, we're playing the long game \u2014 we want to control the board and force him into a mistake! Let's go DOWN and stay aggressive but safe! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

He's sitting at 3 apples, looking real small and real scared in that corner! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc8e\n\n**THE SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS:**\n- **Your Snake (ID 0):** Head: (5, 4). Body: [(6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3)]. Size: 5.\n- **Snake #1:** Head: (7, 5). Body: [(7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. Size: 4.\n- **The Matchup:** We have the weight advantage! If we collide heads, HE DIES and WE WIN the tie-break because we have more apples! (Score 4 vs 3). But we play smart!\n\n**THE TACTICAL GRID:**\n- **UP (5, 5):** This moves us closer to his tail and the center. Very safe!\n- **DOWN (5, 3):** Moves us toward apples at (5, 2) and (6, 3). Strong positioning.\n- **LEFT (4, 4):** Moves us away from the enemy. We don't run from fights on this channel! \ud83d\ude24\n- **RIGHT (6, 4):** **DEAD!** That's our own body. Don't be a clip for a \"Fail Comp\"! \u274c\n\n**THE \"BOX-IN\" STRATEGY:**\nLook at Snake #1 at (7, 5). He is literally sandwiched! His body is above him at (7, 6). If he tries to go LEFT to (6, 5), he's entering our territory. If he goes RIGHT to (8, 5) or DOWN to (7, 4), he's hitting OUR body or the wall soon. \n\nWait, look at (6, 4)\u2014that's where our neck is. If he moves DOWN to (7, 4), he HITS our body and dies! He's restricted. We want to move **UP** to (5, 5). \n\n**WHY UP?**\nIf we move UP to (5, 5), we are mirroring his position. We stay in his face. If he tries to move towards the center (6, 5), we are right there at (5, 5) to cut him off or force a head-on collision that we win! We're playing high-pressure defense. He's trapped against the right wall and his own tail. Let's squeeze the life out of his options! \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe move UP to (5, 5) to maintain the height advantage and stay near his head. Next turn, we look to pivot LEFT or UP depending on his panic move. We are controlling the middle of the board while he is stuck in a 3x3 pocket. Keep the pressure high, keep the score higher, and wait for him to \"crash out\"! \n\nUP",

That changes everything.\n\nFirst, check our safe moves from (7,5):\n\nUP \u2192 (7,6): That's our own body segment! \u274c Suicide.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7,4): That's enemy body (snake #0's segment at (7,4))? Wait, check board \u2014 at turn 7, his body is [(6,4), (7,4), (7,3), (8,3)]. Yes, (7,4) is his body! Moving there would kill us. \u274c  \nLEFT \u2192 (6,5): Empty \u2705  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8,5): Empty \u2705  \n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are safe.

So he can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nWe need to avoid head-on collision \u2014 if we move into same cell he moves into, we both die. Since he has more apples, we lose in a tie-break! So we must avoid that.\n\nCheck possible overlaps:\n\nIf we go LEFT to (6,5):  \n- Could he go to (6,5)? No, he can't go RIGHT to (6,4) then (6,5) in one move. He's at (5,4). His possible moves: (5,5), (5,3), (4,4). No overlap. \u2705\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,5):  \n- Could he go to (8,5)? No, too far. \u2705\n\nSo both moves avoid immediate head-on.\n\nBut long-term: He's longer, so in a future head-on, we die. We need to grow ASAP. Look at apples:  \n- (6,3) is close to him \u2014 he might go DOWN to (5,3) then next turn to (6,3)?  \n- (6,1) is below.  \n- (7,0) is far.  \n- (5,0) far.  \n- (5,2) is near us? Actually (5,2) is apple \u2014 from (7,5), going LEFT to (6,5) then DOWN to (6,4)? Wait (6,4) is his body currently, but he'll move.\n\nBetter plan: Go LEFT to (6,5). Why?  \n- Puts us closer to center and apples like (5,2), (6,3), (6,1).  \n- From (6,5), next turn we could go DOWN to (6,4) if he vacates it, or LEFT to (5,5), or UP to (6,6) \u2014 but (6,6) is our body currently.  \n- Also, if he goes UP to (5,5), we'd be adjacent at (6,5) \u2014 not same cell, safe.  \n- If he goes DOWN to (5,3), we're not blocking.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (8,5) pushes us to right edge \u2014 fewer options, away from apples.\n\nWe need to grow to match his length! So let's target apples aggressively but safely.\n\nLEFT seems better for growth potential.\n\nAlso, think about boxing him: He's at (5,4), we go to (6,5) \u2014 not directly boxing but maybe next turn we can move to (5,5) or (6,4) to limit his moves.\n\nChat, we're behind in length \u2014 we need to catch up!

If we move **RIGHT** and he moves **LEFT**, we COLLIDE heads at (6, 5.5) effectively! Since we have the higher score, if we both die in a head-on collision, **WE STILL WIN THE GAME!** \ud83c\udfc6 We have the tie-breaker advantage!\n\n**THE TACTICAL GRID:**\n- **UP (5, 6):** **DANGER!** That's Snake #1's tail at (6, 6) and (5, 6). If we move UP and he moves his tail moves, it's okay, but if we move into his body, we're cooked! \n- **DOWN (5, 4):** **DEAD!** That's our own neck. We aren't throwing for the highlights today! \u274c\n- **LEFT (4, 5):** Safe, but it's a retreat. We don't back down when we're winning!\n- **RIGHT (6, 5):** **THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY.** This is his current head position. \n\n**THE ULTIMATE TRAP:**\nChat, look at Snake #1's options. He is at (6, 5). \n- If he moves UP (6, 6), he hits his own body.\n- If he moves RIGHT (7, 5), he hits his own body.\n- If he moves DOWN (6, 4), he hits **OUR** body and dies!\n- His **ONLY** safe move is LEFT (5, 5).\n\nWait, if his only move is LEFT to (5, 5) and we are at (5, 5), we are on a collision course! If we stay still, we die, but we both move at once! If we move **UP**, we dodge his head and leave him gasping for air. If we move **LEFT**, we create space. \n\nBut check the \"Box-In\" strategy: If we move **UP to (5, 6)**, we are occupying the space his tail just left. We are wrapping around him like a boa constrictor! He is trapped in a 2x2 square of death! (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6). He has NO WHERE TO GO but into us!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe move **UP** to (5, 6). This puts us directly above him. He is forced to try and escape through the bottom or the left, but our body at (5,4) and (6,4) blocks his southward escape. We are suffocating his movement.

We need to close that gap and pressure him.\n\nFirst, check our safe moves from (6,5):\n\nUP \u2192 (6,6): That's our own body! \u274c Suicide.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6,4): That's enemy body? Wait, check board \u2014 snake #0's body includes (6,4)? Yes, at turn 8 his body is [(5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (7,3)]. So (6,4) is his body segment! Moving there = death. \u274c  \nLEFT \u2192 (5,5): That's enemy HEAD right now! But he's moving this turn too. If we move LEFT and he stays still (unlikely), we'd collide with his head at (5,5) after movement? Actually, simultaneous move \u2014 if we both go into same cell, head-on collision. If he moves out of (5,5) and we move into it, it's empty. Risky? Let's analyze.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7,5): That's our own body segment (our neck from last turn)! \u274c  \n\nSo only LEFT is possibly safe? Wait, we must eliminate moves that would kill us *regardless of enemy move* \u2014 moving into our own body or off-board is instant death. Moving into enemy body is instant death. Moving LEFT into (5,5) is only deadly if enemy stays there. But we can't know his move. So LEFT is *potentially* safe if he moves away.\n\nBut we must also consider: if he moves LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5), and we move LEFT to (5,5), we'd be fine \u2014 he vacates it. If he moves UP to (5,6) or DOWN to (5,4), we'd be fine. If he moves RIGHT to (6,5) \u2014 that's our current head, but we're leaving it, so no collision. Actually, if he moves RIGHT to (6,5) and we move LEFT to (5,5), no head-on. The only dangerous case is if he stays STILL (chooses no move? not possible) or if he moves in a way that puts him back into (5,5) \u2014 impossible in one move from (5,5). So LEFT is actually safe from immediate collision! \u2705\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about moving into his *future* body after his move? No, because his body follows his head; only his tail might vanish if he doesn't eat. He didn't eat last turn (no apple at (5,4)), so his tail (7,3) will vanish this turn. So (6,4) stays as his body? Actually his body segments shift: new head position, then old head becomes neck, etc. So (6,4) will remain his body this turn. So DOWN is still unsafe.\n\nSo only LEFT is viable? Let's double-check RIGHT: (7,5) is our own body \u2014 yes, our body is [(7,5), (7,6), (6,6)] \u2014 so (7,5) is our second segment. Can't go there. \u274c\n\nSo only LEFT is safe? That means we're forced LEFT! Unless... can we go UP? (6,6) is our third segment \u2014 yes, our body from turn 7: head was (7,5), body (7,6), (6,6), (6,5)? Wait, our current body: head (6,5), body: [(7,5), (7,6), (6,6)]. So (6,6) is our tail. That's our own body! So UP is suicide. \u274c\n\nSo only LEFT is safe. Let's verify:  \nLEFT to (5,5): currently enemy head, but he will move. Possible head-on if he moves into (5,5) from elsewhere? He can't be elsewhere and move into (5,5) in one move except from (5,4), (5,6), (4,5), (6,5). He's at (5,5) now, so he'll leave it. The only way he ends at (5,5) is if he moves in a loop in one move \u2014 impossible. So safe.\n\nNow, predict his moves from (5,5):  \nUP \u2192 (5,6): empty \u2705  \nDOWN \u2192 (5,4): his own body? Wait, his body after moving: his current body is [(5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (7,3)]. If he moves DOWN to (5,4), that's moving into his own neck! That's suicide for him. Would he do that? Possibly if he's dumb, but assume rational. So DOWN for him is likely unsafe. \u274c for him.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4,5): empty \u2705  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6,5): empty (we're leaving it) \u2705  \n\nSo he can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWe go LEFT to (5,5). If he goes UP to (5,6), fine. If he goes LEFT to (4,5), fine. If he goes RIGHT to (6,5), fine \u2014 no collision.\n\nNow long-term: We're forced LEFT, so let's make it aggressive! This puts us at (5,5), right where he was. Apples nearby: (5,2) is close! From (5,5), next turn we can go DOWN to (5,4) \u2014 but will that be safe? His old body at (5,4) will be gone after this turn if he doesn't eat? Wait, if he doesn't eat this turn, his tail (7,3) disappears, so (5,4) becomes his second segment if he moves? Actually, let's track: his current body: [(5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (7,3)]. If he moves to (5,6), new body: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) \u2014 tail (7,3) gone. So (5,4) remains his body. So (5,4) will be occupied next turn. So we can't go DOWN to (5,4) next turn unless he eats and grows.\n\nBetter to target apple at (5,2): from (5,5), go DOWN to (5,4) if vacated later, or go LEFT to (4,5) then DOWN to (4,4), etc.\n\nWe need to grow! Also, think about boxing him: He's at (5,5) now, moving somewhere. If he goes UP to (5,6), we're at (5,5) \u2014 we're adjacent vertically. Could set up a trap.\n\nChat, we're forced LEFT this turn \u2014 but that's okay! Let's use it to take center control and hunt apples. Next turn, we'll have more options from (5,5).\n\nPlan for next turn: From (5,5), check safe moves, likely DOWN may be blocked by his body, so maybe LEFT or UP to chase apples (3,6) or (4,2). We'll adapt.\n\nLEFT",
