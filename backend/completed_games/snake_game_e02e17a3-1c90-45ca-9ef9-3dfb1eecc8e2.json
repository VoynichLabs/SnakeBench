The enemy snake is at (3, 5) with a body at (3, 4).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distances to each apple from my current position:\n- To (5, 2): |7-5| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- To (6, 8): |7-6| + |6-8| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (8, 9): |7-8| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- To (2, 5): |7-2| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (3, 0): |7-3| + |6-0| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 8) with a distance of 3.

From the current position (8, 8), the closest apple is at (8, 9) with a Manhattan distance of 1. The path to this apple would involve moving UP (from (8, 8) to (8, 9)).\n\n**Potential Threats:**\n1. Enemy snake #1 is at (3, 8). It is not immediately threatening since it's far from the apple at (8, 9).\n2. I must avoid hitting walls or the enemy snake. Since my snake has a body segment at (7, 8), I need to ensure I don't move back to (7, 8) or hit any walls.\n\n**Next Move:**\nFrom (8, 8), the first step towards the apple at (8, 9) is to move UP to (8, 9).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving to (8, 9), I will have eaten the apple and grown. I will then need to choose the next closest apple and move towards it. I will prioritize moving towards the nearest apple while avoiding any potential collisions. I will also keep an eye on the enemy snake's position to anticipate any potential threats.\n\nDecided next move: UP",

Instead, moving up could delay that decision momentarily. It gives me a chance to see snake #0's move. This move does not only keep me out of danger but also opens up possibilities to quickly adjust my course without backing into my own body should I decide to then slide left for the apple at (5, 2) or right if snake #0 doesn't block that path closely. Also, moving up edges me closer to the apple at (2, 5) if necessary.\n\nNext move strategy: Keep an eye on snake #0's move. If it does not hinder me, I will pivot towards (5, 2) to snag the apple, else consider if (8, 9) becomes feasibly outflankable depending on its positioning next turn.\n\nNext move: UP",
