Let's map this out.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **My snake (ID 1):** Head at (5, 0). Body empty. I'm the lone wolf down there. \n- **Enemy snake (ID 0):** Head at (0, 1). Body empty. He's chilling in the corner.\n- **Apples:** Lots of apples on the board. Key ones near me: (7, 0) is RIGHT there on the bottom row! That's an immediate +1 if I can get it. But I need to check safety first.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 is at (0, 1). He's likely going to move RIGHT towards (1, 1) or maybe UP to (0, 2). He's not an immediate threat to me right now. I need to watch where he goes.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n1. **UP:** From (5, 0) to (5, 1). Safe? Board is 10x10, so y=1 is valid. No body there. Enemy is far left. But I'd be moving AWAY from the bottom apple at (7, 0). Also, going UP from the bottom row limits my downward escape later.\n2. **DOWN:** From (5, 0) to (5, -1). **DEAD.** Off the board. Eliminated immediately.\n3. **LEFT:** From (5, 0) to (4, 0). Safe? y=0 is bottom row. x=4 is valid. But is there an apple? No. (7, 0) is to my RIGHT. This moves me away from food. I'd be wasting a turn not securing a point.\n4. **RIGHT:** From (5, 0) to (6, 0). **WAIT.** Looking at the board:\n   - Row 0: `. . . . . . 1 . A . .`\n   - My head is at 5. (6, 0) is empty.\n   - (7, 0) is an Apple.\n   - If I move RIGHT to (6, 0), I'm setting up to grab (7, 0) next turn.\n   - Is (6, 0) safe? Yes. No bodies.\n   - Is moving RIGHT into the apple? No, but it's positioning.\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:**\nWait, the board says: Row 0 is `. . . . . . 1 . A . .` (Indices 0-9).\nMy head is at index 5 (x=5).\nApple is at index 7 (x=7).\nTo get the apple at (7, 0), I need to move RIGHT twice.\nTurn 1: Move to (6, 0).\nTurn 2: Move to (7, 0) -> **EAT APPLE, GROW.**\n\n**ALTERNATIVE CHECK:**\nCan I move UP and then circle back? Maybe, but that wastes time. The apple at (7, 0) is FREE real estate. It's on my row. No obstacles between me and it except empty space.\nSnake #0 is at (0, 1). He can't reach (7, 0) in one turn. He can't even reach me.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nSecure the bag immediately. Get the first point on the board. Domination starts now.\nIf I move RIGHT, I claim the space (6, 0).\nIf I move UP, I leave the apple open for... well, no one can get it this turn, but I lose position.\nI need to think about the future. I'm at the bottom edge. Moving RIGHT keeps me on the edge but moves toward food. Moving UP puts me in the open but away from this food.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nGrab the apple at (7, 0) next turn. Then assess the board. We need to box in Snake #0. He's at (0,1). He's cornered on the left. I am on the right. I need to move towards the center after eating.\n\n**FINAL CHECK:**\nIs moving to (6, 0) safe?\n- Board boundaries: Yes.\n- Own body: Empty.\n- Enemy body: Empty.\n- Enemy head: At (0,1). He can't hit me.\n- Collision risk: None.\n\nLet's go!\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Still in the bottom-left corner, but he moved UP last turn (from (1,1) looking at the board... wait, last turn he was at (1,1) in the replay? Actually looking at the \"board state\" in the prompt for Turn 1, it shows him at (1,1). In my last turn's board state (Turn 0), he was at (0,1). So he moved RIGHT to (1,1) while I moved RIGHT to (6,0). Good.\n- **Apples:** There's an apple at (7, 0) just to my right. That's the immediate target.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n1.  **LEFT (to (5, 0)):** I was there last turn. It's empty now because I moved off it. Safe, but moves me away from the apple at (7, 0).\n2.  **RIGHT (to (7, 0)):** That's an apple! I eat it, grow to size 1, and score a point. Is it safe? The cell is empty. The only risk is Snake #0 moving into that cell at the same time. He is at (1,1). Manhattan distance from (1,1) to (7,0) is |7-1| + |0-1| = 6 + 1 = 7. He cannot reach (7,0) in one turn. So it's safe.\n3.  **UP (to (6, 1)):** Safe cell. But I miss the apple. The apple is right there! I need to secure the point to start dominating.\n4.  **DOWN (to (6, -1)):** Off the board. Dead. Can't do that.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGrab the apple at (7, 0). It's free real estate. Snake #0 is busy in the bottom left. I need to build my score and size to start boxing him in. If I take this apple, I'll be at (7, 0) with length 1.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7,0) this turn. Next turn, I'll be at (7,0) with length 1 (tail at (6,0)). I should look to move towards the center or pick up other nearby apples. Snake #0 is on the left side. I need to eventually move up and cut him off from the right side of the board.

Snake #0 is still lurking in the bottom left, but we need to secure our territory.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n*   **My snake (ID 1):** Head at (7, 0), Body at (6, 0). Just ate the apple at (7,0). Tail is at (6,0).\n*   **Enemy snake (ID 0):** Head at (1, 2), Body empty. He moved UP from (1,1). Still far away.\n*   **Apples:** Lots of them! (7,9) is way up top. (5,6), (8,7), (6,9), etc. We need to start moving towards the center to dominate the board and cut off Snake #0.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n1.  **LEFT (to (6, 0)):** My tail is currently there. Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail won't move until I make a move. Moving into my own tail is generally safe because the tail moves forward as I move into it. However, this keeps me on the bottom row. I want to start moving UP and RIGHT to claim the top-right quadrant.\n2.  **RIGHT (to (8, 0)):** This is valid. Bottom row, moving further right. But I'm already at the right side of the bottom row. I need to go UP to get to the apples in the middle/top.\n3.  **DOWN (to (7, -1)):** Off the board. Dead. **ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **UP (to (7, 1)):** This moves me off the bottom row and into the second row. It's empty. It opens up paths to the apples at (6,5), (5,6), etc. This is the move that gets me towards the action.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm choosing **UP**. \nWhy? Because staying on the bottom row (LEFT or RIGHT) limits my movement. Moving UP into (7, 1) is safe (empty) and positions me to start navigating the center of the board. Snake #0 is at (1, 2) on the left. By moving UP, I start claiming the center and top-right area, effectively boxing him into the left side.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nHead towards the cluster of apples in the center (around (5,6), (6,5)). Use my length to create a barrier. If Snake #0 comes up, we force a head-on collision. I have 1 apple, he has 0. I win ties.\n\nUP",

It's a tie on the scoreboard, but I'm visually dominant on the right side of the board. Time to expand my territory.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** Head at (7, 3), Body at (7, 2). I just moved UP from (7, 2). My tail is now at (7, 1) and will vanish *after* my next move.\n- **Enemy Position:** Head at (2, 4), Body at (2, 3). He's in the bottom left quadrant.\n- **The Trap Setup:** I want to cut off the top-right corner. From (7, 3), I have access to the vertical line x=7. However, I need to prepare to sweep left across the top to block the enemy from reaching the high-value apples like (6,9) and (7,9).\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS (ELIMINATING THE DEADLY):**\n- **DOWN (to (7, 2)):** CRASH! My body is currently at (7, 2). I die instantly. \u274c\n- **UP (to (7, 4)):** Currently empty. Moves me toward the top. Good for vertical control, but doesn't set up the horizontal blockade yet.\n- **LEFT (to (6, 3)):** Currently empty. This is the pivot point. It moves me toward the center and prepares me to sweep LEFT across the upper rows on subsequent turns. It keeps the path to the top apples open while positioning me to intercept the enemy if he tries to come right.\n- **RIGHT (to (8, 3)):** Currently empty. Safe, but limits my future movement and doesn't help me control the center/top.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm choosing **LEFT** to **(6, 3)**.\n\n**THE STRATEGY (FORMING THE WALL):**\n1.  **Dominance:** Moving LEFT puts me in the center column (x=6), right under the apple cluster at (6, 5) and (6, 6).\n2.  **Aggression:** From (6, 3), on the next turn, I can continue LEFT to (5, 3) or UP to (6, 4). I want to sweep up along the x=5 or x=6 column.\n3.  **Boxing Him In:** Snake #0 is at (2, 4). If I sweep LEFT across the top, I create a barrier. If he tries to cross my path, it's a head-on collision. Since we are tied on apples, a head-on collision is a draw (both die), but if I eat an apple *before* colliding (getting to 2 apples), I win the tie-breaker.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSweep LEFT to (5, 3) or (5, 4) next to secure the center-right. Then, rush UP to Y=5 or Y=6 to establish the blockade line. We're going for the apples at (6,5) and (5,3) to get the score lead, then we box him out.\n\nLEFT",

Let's clarify.\n    *   **Last Move:** I moved LEFT from (6, 3) to (5, 3).\n    *   **Current State:** My Head is (5, 3). My Body is [(6, 3), (7, 3)].\n    *   **New Move:** I need to move from (5, 3).\n- **Enemy Action Prediction:** He's at (3, 5). He sees apples at (7, 5) and (7, 6) or maybe (4, 5). He is likely to move UP towards (3, 6) or RIGHT towards (4, 5). (4, 5) is an apple! He probably wants that. If he goes RIGHT to (4, 5), he gets close to me.\n\n**THREATS:**\n- If I go DOWN to (5, 2): Safe, but I lose the \"Box In\" strategy. I'm in the open.\n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 3): Safe. I'm moving back towards the center/right.\n- If I go LEFT to (4, 3): Safe, but moving closer to the edge. Less options.\n- If I go UP to (5, 4): **RISKY.** Why? Because if the enemy moves RIGHT from (3, 5) to (4, 5), he is now at (4, 5).\n    *   If I go UP to (5, 4), I am adjacent to him at (4, 5).\n    *   If he moves UP again next turn to (4, 6), and I am at (5, 4) or (5, 5), we might head-on collision.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need to close the trap. The enemy is at (3, 5). The apple at (4, 5) is the bait. If I move **UP** to (5, 4), I am perfectly positioned to cut off his path to the right side.\nIf he takes the apple at (4, 5), he might die if I crash into him? No, I can only kill him if I move into his head or he moves into my body.\nIf I go UP to (5, 4), and he goes RIGHT to (4, 5):\n- He eats the apple.\n- He grows into (3, 5).\n- I am at (5, 4).\n- Next turn, if I move LEFT to (4, 4), I cut off his tail? No, his tail is at (2, 4).\n- Actually, if I go UP to (5, 4), I control the column above him.\n- Wait, checking coordinates: Enemy at (3, 5). Apple at (4, 5).\n- If I go UP to (5, 4), I am two squares away from his potential position (4, 5).\n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 3), I'm safer but letting him expand.\n- If I go LEFT to (4, 3), I'm moving away from the action.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\n```\n 7 . . . A . A . . A A\n 6 . A . . . A A A . .\n 5 . . . 0 A . A A . .\n```\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 4):\n- I threaten (5, 5).\n- I flank the enemy who is likely moving to (4, 5).\n- I force him to either retreat down or risk a collision.\n- If he moves RIGHT to (4, 5) and I am at (5, 4), I am close.\n- If he moves UP to (3, 6), I can chase him up the y-axis.\n\nIs there a better move?\n- **RIGHT (6, 3):** My body is (7, 3). This is safe. It moves me away from the enemy.\n- **DOWN (5, 2):** Safe.\n- **LEFT (4, 3):** Safe.\n\nBut we want to **BOX HIM IN**.\nIf I go UP to (5, 4), I am in a strong central position.\nLet's check the \"Box In\" logic.\nMy body is at (6, 3) and (7, 3). This is a vertical line on the right.\nMy head at (5, 4) creates a barrier.\nThe enemy is at (3, 5). To get to the apples on the right (7, 5, 7, 6), he has to pass through x=5 or x=6.\nI am occupying x=5.\nIf I go UP to (5, 4), I effectively block the horizontal path for him (unless he goes up and over).\nHe is at y=5. If I go UP to (5, 4), I am at y=4.\nIf he goes RIGHT to (4, 5), he is at (4, 5).\nIf I go UP to (5, 4), and he goes RIGHT to (4, 5), we are adjacent.\nIf I then go LEFT to (4, 4), I am behind him (if he grew into (3, 5)). Or I crash into him?\nIf he is at (4, 5) and I am at (5, 4), and I move LEFT to (4, 4) and he moves UP to (4, 6), no collision.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 4) and he moves LEFT to (3, 5), no collision.\nIf I move UP to (5, 4) and he moves RIGHT to (4, 5), he eats the apple.\nNext turn: I can move LEFT to (4, 4). He is at (4, 5) (head) and his body is at (3, 5).\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 4), I am safe.\nWait, if I am at (5, 4) and he is at (4, 5).\nIf I move UP to (5, 5), I am safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 4), I am safe.\nIf I move UP to (5, 4) now, I am placing myself directly between him and the right side apples.\nThis is the play. I need to push him left into the wall.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** Push him into the bottom-left corner. My body at (7, 3) and (6, 3) creates a vertical wall on the right. By moving UP to (5, 4), I start forming a horizontal wall at y=4 or y=5. If he moves RIGHT, I am ready to block. If he moves UP, I chase.\n\n**MOVE:** UP\n\n```text\nUP\n```",

We're going aggressive.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (5, 4). Body at [(5, 3), (6, 3)]. Apples: 2.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (4, 5). Body at [(3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. Apples: 3.\n*   **The Grid:**\n    *   **Right Wall:** My body is currently acting as a vertical wall at x=6 and x=7 (y=3).\n    *   **Enemy Location:** He is at (4, 5). He just moved RIGHT from (3, 5) to eat the apple at (4, 5).\n    *   **Top-Right Apples:** There are apples at (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 6), (8, 7), etc. These are on the right side.\n    *   **Top-Left Apples:** (7, 9) is top right, but (9, 4) is bottom right, (9, 7) is right edge. (1, 6) is left.\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nIf I go UP to (5, 5):\n*   I am at (5, 5).\n*   The enemy is at (4, 5).\n*   We are adjacent side-by-side.\n\n**WHAT DOES THE ENEMY DO?**\nHe just ate an apple at (4, 5). He grew into (3, 5). His head is now (4, 5).\nWhere is he likely to go?\n1.  **UP:** To (4, 6). There is an apple at (3, 7) and (1, 6). This leads him towards the top left.\n2.  **RIGHT:** To (5, 5). There is an apple at (5, 6). This moves him toward the center-right.\n3.  **DOWN:** To (4, 4). There's nothing there. He just came from (3, 5). Unlikely.\n4.  **LEFT:** To (3, 5). That's his own body! He cannot go there.\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS (FROM 5, 4):**\n1.  **UP (5, 5):** Moves me into the path of the enemy if he goes RIGHT. If he goes RIGHT to (5, 5) and I go UP to (5, 5), **DOUBLE KILL**. I lose because he has more apples (3 vs 2). This is a bad risk.\n2.  **LEFT (4, 4):** Moves me into the space behind where he just was. If he goes UP to (4, 6), I am safe at (4, 4). If he goes RIGHT to (5, 5), I am safe at (4, 4). This puts me directly below his potential path.\n3.  **RIGHT (6, 4):** Moves me next to my own body at (6, 3). It's safe, but I'm moving parallel to him. It keeps me on the right side.\n4.  **DOWN (5, 3):** Moves me into my own body! (My body is at (5, 3)). **DEATH.**\n\n**STRATEGY: \"THE BOX IN\"**\nThe enemy is at (4, 5). I am at (5, 4).\nIf I move **LEFT** to (4, 4):\n*   I position myself directly under him (assuming he stays at y=5).\n*   If he moves UP to (4, 6) or RIGHT to (5, 5), I am NOT in his way, but I am cutting off his return path down if I stay there.\n*   **CRITICAL:** If he moves RIGHT to (5, 5), I am at (4, 4). He is at (5, 5). We are diagonal. Next turn, I can move UP to (4, 5) to claim the spot he just left, or RIGHT to (5, 4) to chase him.\n*   If he moves UP to (4, 6), I am at (4, 4). I can chase him up the column.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (4, 4) is the most versatile move. It doesn't put me in immediate head-on collision range (unlike UP which puts us side-by-side). It allows me to react to his move.\nIf he goes RIGHT (to 5,5), I can follow RIGHT or UP next.\nIf he goes UP (to 4,6), I can go UP (to 4,5) or LEFT.\nIf he goes DOWN (to 4,4), he dies on my body? No, if I move LEFT to (4,4) and he moves DOWN to (4,4), we collide. He has more apples, I die. But he is unlikely to move down.\n\nWait, let's look at the coordinates again.\nEnemy is at (4, 5).\nI am at (5, 4).\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4, 4):\n*   Enemy at (4, 5).\n*   Me at (4, 4).\n*   We are in the same column, stacked vertically.\n*   If he goes UP to (4, 6), I am safe.\n*   If he goes RIGHT to (5, 5), I am safe.\n*   If he goes DOWN to (4, 4), we collide. He dies (head hits my body). I survive. **FREE KILL.**\n*   If he goes LEFT to (3, 5), he dies (hits his own body).\n\nSo **LEFT** is actually a trap! If he tries to retreat or mess up, he dies on my body.\nIf he plays safe and goes UP or RIGHT, I am perfectly positioned to chase him.\nIf I go UP to (5, 5), I risk a double KO on the next turn if he decides to go RIGHT (which is a natural move for him to get apples).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 4), I'm moving away from him, letting him control the center.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **LEFT**. This puts me in a column under him. It pressures him. If he moves down, he dies. If he moves up, I chase. If he moves right, I flank him.\n\nLet's secure the board control. I need to force him into a corner.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nIf he moves UP, I chase UP. If he moves RIGHT, I cut him off. I want to trap him in the top-left or bottom-left.\n\n```text\nLEFT\n```",

(4, 3) is currently empty on the map. Yes.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (3, 4), is it safe? (3, 4) is occupied by the enemy's tail! The map shows (3, 4) as 'T'. If I move there, I hit his body. Since he has 3 apples and I have 2, if I hit him, **I DIE**.\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy has a choice:\n1.  **UP (5, 6):** Moves towards the center. He might eat the apple at (5, 6).\n2.  **LEFT (4, 5):** Moves into his own body! He dies. (Wait, looking at his body: [(4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)]. If he moves LEFT to (4, 5), he hits his own segment. **HE DIES.**)\n3.  **RIGHT (6, 5):** Moves towards the right wall.

However, if he gets another apple, the pressure mounts. We need to play aggressively but smart. Remember the core rule: If I have the score advantage, I force a head-on collision. I DO NOT have the advantage. I need to close the gap.\n\n**ANALYZING THE BOARD:**\n\n**My Position (Snake 1):**\n*   **Head:** (5, 3)\n*   **Body:** [(4, 3), (4, 4)]\n*   **Length:** 3 (Head + 2 Body)\n*   **Last Move:** RIGHT (from 4,3 to 5,3)\n\n**Enemy Position (Snake 0):**\n*   **Head:** (6, 6)\n*   **Body:** [(5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)]\n*   **Length:** 6 (Head + 5 Body)\n*   **Apples:** 5\n\n**The Layout (Visual Check):**\n*   (5, 3) is my head. I have (4, 3) and (4, 4) as body.\n*   Enemy head is at (6, 6).\n*   Enemy body snakes down to (5, 6) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4).\n*   **Crucial:** The enemy body creates a wall blocking the left side (x=3,4,5 at y=4,5,6).\n*   Apples are scattered. Closest apples to me: (6, 5) is very close. (7, 5) is also close. (6, 8) is close to the enemy.\n\n**EVALUATING MY OPTIONS (From 5, 3):**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (4, 3):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** My body is at (4, 3). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Verdict:** INVALID.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 2):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** Empty (based on the board map provided).\n    *   **Board Limits:** Valid (y=2 is within 0-9).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe for now.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** There are no apples listed at y=2. I would be moving away from the action (center/top).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Low. I need to eat to catch up. Going down isolates me from the enemy and the apples at (6,5), (7,5), etc.\n\n3.  **UP to (5, 4):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** Looking at the board map, at (5,4) is a 'T' (Tail of Snake 0). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Verdict:** INVALID.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** Empty.\n    *   **Board Limits:** Valid.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** It puts me adjacent to the apple at (6, 5) (1 step away). It also keeps me in the central column (x=6).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** High. It maintains pressure on the center. From (6, 3), I have moves to (7, 3), (6, 2), or (5, 3) (tail moves). I am not boxed in.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nThe board is a maze. The enemy is bulky (length 6) and I am small (length 3). I cannot go LEFT (hit self). I cannot go UP (hit enemy tail). I cannot go DOWN (it's safe, but it's a retreat).\n\nI must go **RIGHT**. Why?\n1.  **Momentum:** I am currently on a path toward the apples at (6,5) and (7,5).\n2.  **Positioning:** From (6, 3), I am positioned to strike. If the enemy moves Left or Down, I can potentially cut him off or eat the apple at (6,5) before he does.\n3.  **Survival:** It is the only safe move that doesn't trap me in a corner or walk me into a wall of my own making. The enemy is at (6,6). If he moves DOWN to (6,5) and I move RIGHT to (6,3) (and then potentially UP next turn), we might collide. **But** if he moves DOWN to (6,5) and I eat the apple there this turn, I grow. If we collide next turn, I might have the size advantage if I eat now. I need that apple.\n\nI need to close the score gap. (6,5) is the target. Moving Right is the only path to it.\n\n**LONG-TERM NOTE:**\nWatch the enemy head at (6,6). If he moves Down, he eats (6,5). If he moves Left, he eats (6,5) potentially next turn. I need to move. I am choosing RIGHT to put (6,5) in my immediate reach for the next turn. This is a calculated risk to chase points.\n\n**CHAT! LET'S HUNT!**\n\n```text\nRIGHT\n```",

My head is at (7,3) and the board is getting spicy. Let's break down the moves.\n\nFirst, checking **RIGHT** to (8,3): Is it safe? My body is at (7,3) -> (6,3) -> (5,3), so (8,3) is clear. Is the enemy there? Their head is at (7,5), and they move simultaneously. If they go DOWN, they hit (7,4). If they go RIGHT, they hit (8,5). Neither hits (8,3). Their body is at (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). (8,3) is clear of that too. Is (8,3) on the board? Yes. This move is safe and buys me distance.\n\nNow, checking **LEFT** to (6,3): Is it safe? My body is at (6,3)! That's a crash. I would die instantly. **ELIMINATED.**\n\nChecking **UP** to (7,4): Is it safe? My body is below. The enemy head is at (7,5). If they move DOWN, they crash into (7,4). That would be a DOUBLE KILL. I don't want to die even if they do. Plus, the apple at (7,4) isn't listed as a drop (the closest apples are (7,9), (8,7), etc.), but even if there was, trading my life for theirs when I'm down 2-7 is a bad play. I need to survive to outlast them. **RISKY / ELIMINATED.**\n\nChecking **DOWN** to (7,2): Is it safe? My body is at (7,3) -> (6,3) -> (5,3). (7,2) is clear. Is the enemy there? Their head is at (7,5), body starts at (7,6). They can't reach (7,2) in one turn. On the board? Yes. (7,2) is currently an empty space on the grid (Row 3 is \". A . . . . T T 1 . .\" so (7,2) is the '.' before the '1'). This is also a safe move.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n- **RIGHT (8,3)**: Moves me away from the enemy. Opens up the right side of the board. Good for future maneuvering.\n- **DOWN (7,2)**: Moves me down into the bottom row. Limits my vertical movement next turn (can't go DOWN off board).\n\n**STRATEGY:** I need to box him in. He's at (7,5) looking up. I should move to the side to avoid a head-on collision and give myself space. Moving RIGHT gives me more open board space to the east. Moving DOWN traps me in the corner.\n\n**DECISION:** Moving RIGHT is the play. It keeps me alive, avoids the double-kill risk of UP, and maintains board control.\n\n```text\nRIGHT\n```",

He\u2019s stuck chasing apples on the left, and I\u2019m ready to sweep the right side and cut him off.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at (8, 3). Body: [(7, 3), (6, 3)]. I am safe.\n2.  **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 head at (6,5). His body stretches from (7,5) all the way to (3,4). He is long, sluggish, and most importantly, **he cannot touch me right now**. If he moves DOWN, he hits (6,4). If he moves RIGHT, he hits (7,5) (his own body). If he moves LEFT, he goes to (5,5). If he moves UP, (6,6).\n3.  **My Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT to (7,3):** CRASH. Dead. \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **DOWN to (8,2):** Safe. But I want to dominate the board, not sink to the bottom. The bottom is a dead end if I get trapped.

This positions me directly to the right of the enemy's tail and opens up the top-right quadrant.\n    *   **RIGHT to (9,3):** SAFE. But this hugs the wall. Limiting my future moves. We don't want to get boxed in by the wall.\n4.  **The Play:** I need to cut off his expansion. The apples are at the top: (7,9), (8,7), (6,9), (9,7), (7,8), (6,8). By moving **UP**, I am positioning myself to race him to the top-right corner. I am creating a wall to his east. If he tries to go for the apples on the right, he has to deal with me.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Use the right side as my territory. Move UP to (8,4), then potentially RIGHT to (9,4) or UP to (8,5) (checking safety next turn). I need to start eating apples to close the 6-point gap. Ignoring apples is a loss; I need them to grow and block him. I will box him in on the left while I feast on the right. \ud83d\ude08\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n*   (8,4) is within bounds.\n*   (8,4) is not part of my body (current body is at y=3).\n*   (8,4) is not part of enemy body (enemy body is mostly at y=5,6,7).\n*   Enemy head cannot reach (8,4) this turn (distance is 2 units).\n\nI am going UP to claim the high ground and set up the flank!\n\nUP",

Let's analyze the new state and the new enemy position. We are looking to cut him off and force a crash.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at (8, 4). Body: [(8, 3), (7, 3)].\n2.  **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 head is at (6, 4). Body: [(6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5)].\n    *   **CRITICAL INFO:** The enemy is directly to my LEFT at (6, 4). We are on the same Y-level (y=4).\n    *   **Enemy's Possible Moves:**\n        *   **UP:** To (6, 5). That's currently occupied by his own body (the segment connects to the head). If he moves UP, he crashes into himself! \ud83d\udc80\n        *   **DOWN:** To (6, 3). Is that safe? Let me check my body. My body is at (8,3) and (7,3). (6,3) is currently empty. If he goes DOWN, he's safe (for now).\n        *   **LEFT:** To (5, 4). Empty? Yes. Safe move.\n        *   **RIGHT:** To (7, 4). Wait, I'm at (8,4). (7,4) is empty. Safe move.\n    *   **My Analysis:** He is likely to move DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT to survive. If he moves UP, he dies instantly. I cannot force him to move UP. I must assume he will survive this turn.\n    *   **Head-on Collision Risk:** If I move LEFT to (7, 4), and he moves RIGHT to (7, 4), we crash. Both die. If I have 2 apples and he has 8, I lose the tie-breaker (he has more). I cannot risk a tie. I need to win. **I must avoid (7,4).**\n    *   **Strategic Threat:** If I move LEFT, I am stepping into his potential path. If he moves DOWN, he stays alive. If he moves RIGHT, he hits me. He might avoid moving RIGHT to survive, but he could also move RIGHT to kill me if he thinks I'll move left? No, he wants to survive. He's at 8 apples, I'm at 2. He wants to drag this out or win. But he's trapped in a corner.\n\n3.  **My Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT to (7,4):** As analyzed, high risk of head-on collision. If we crash, I lose (2 vs 8 apples). I can't take a 50/50 if I lose the draw.\n    *   **DOWN to (8,3):** CRASH into my own body. Dead instantly. \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **RIGHT to (9,4):** SAFE. I move to the wall.\n    *   **UP to (8,5):** Let's check. (8,5) is currently empty. No enemy body there (enemy is at y=4,5,6... wait, enemy body is at (6,5). (8,5) is not (6,5). It's safe.\n\n4.  **Choosing the Move:**\n    *   I am currently at (8,4).\n    *   I want to box him in. He is at (6,4).\n    *   If I move **UP to (8,5)**, I move away from him, securing my flank. I open up the top row (y=5,6...).\n    *   If I move **RIGHT to (9,4)**, I hug the wall. This limits my future moves. I prefer mobility.\n    *   **UP** seems safest. It avoids the collision risk at (7,4) and keeps me away from his body at (6,5).\n    *   **The Trap Plan:** I am currently creating a barrier on his East side. By moving UP, I align myself with his body segment at (6,5) (if I am at (8,5), I am still East of him). Actually, looking at the board:\n        Enemy Head: (6,4)\n        Enemy Body: (6,5), (7,5)...\n        My Head: (8,4)\n        If I go UP to (8,5), I am directly to the East of his body segment at (7,5)? No, (7,5) is West of (8,5).\n        Actually, if I go UP to (8,5), and he goes UP to (6,5), he dies (crash into his own body at (6,5)? Wait, his body is at (6,5). So he CAN'T go UP.\n        So he must go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n        If he goes RIGHT to (7,4), and I go UP to (8,5), we miss. Good.\n        If he goes DOWN to (6,3), we diverge.\n        If he goes LEFT to (5,4), we diverge.\n        **UP** is the move that creates the most distance while maintaining board control.\n\n5.  **Long Term Strategy:**\n    *   He is stuck in the bottom-left quadrant (roughly x=3-7, y=4-6). I am in the bottom-right (x=8-9).\n    *   I need to sweep up and cut off the apples at the top. (9,7) is an apple. (7,9) is an apple.\n    *   By going UP, I am heading towards the top-right cluster.\n    *   I need to grow. I have 2 apples, he has 8. I need to eat. The apple at (9,7) is reachable if I go UP then RIGHT.\n    *   However, I must watch out for him. If I go UP, I leave the line y=4 open. If he goes DOWN, he goes to y=3. I am at y=5. We are separating.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n*   (8,5) is within bounds.\n*   (8,5) is not part of my body (My body is at y=3).\n*   (8,5) is not part of enemy body. Enemy body is at (6,5), (7,5). (8,5) is empty.\n*   Enemy cannot reach (8,5) this turn (he is at x=6).\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nI choose **UP** to (8,5). This avoids the collision zone at (7,4) and sets me up to dominate the right side. I am ignoring the immediate apple at (7,8) for now to secure position. I need to grow, but survival is priority #1. If he moves RIGHT (to 7,4) and I move UP (to 8,5), we live. If he moves DOWN (to 6,3), we live. If he moves LEFT (to 5,4), we live. If he moves UP (to 6,5), he dies. That's his problem.\n\nUP",

We're down 2-8, but the snake isn't dead yet!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Status:** Head at (8, 5). Body is currently at (8, 4) and (8, 3).\n    *   *Wait a second...* I need to check the board state carefully.\n    *   Board Row 5: `. . . . T T T T 1 .`\n    *   This shows my head is actually at **(8, 5)**? No, looking at the ASCII map:\n        Row 5: Index 8 is `1`.\n        So my head is at **(8, 5)**.\n        The board shows `T` (tail segments) at (5,5), (6,5), (7,5).\n        The enemy snake #0 head is at (7, 4).\n        My body in the ASCII map: (8, 4) and (8, 3).\n    *   *Self-Correction from Last Turn:* My last move was UP. I moved from (8,4) to (8,5). So my body *now* occupies (8,4) and (8,3). Correct.\n\n2.  **Enemy Analysis (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (7, 4)\n    *   Body: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5)]\n    *   He is directly to my **LEFT** at (7, 4).\n    *   We are on the same Y-level (y=4? No, I am at y=5. He is at y=4). I am one row above him.\n\n3.  **Possible Moves & Threats:**\n    *   **LEFT to (7, 5):**\n        *   Is it safe? (7, 5) is occupied by the **enemy's body**. If I move LEFT, I die immediately. \ud83d\udeab\n        *   *Wait*, checking the board: Row 5 shows `T T T T 1 .`. The `T`s are enemy tails. So (7, 5) is an enemy body segment.\n        *   **Conclusion: LEFT is DEATH.**\n    *   **DOWN to (8, 4):**\n        *   Is it safe? (8, 4) is my *previous* body position. The rules say moving into my own body (including backwards) is death.\n        *   My current body is [(8,4), (8,3)]. Moving down to (8,4) is hitting myself.\n        *   **Conclusion: DOWN is DEATH.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n        *   Is it safe? (9, 5) is within bounds. It is not in my body. Is it in the enemy body? Enemy is at x=4-7 mostly. (9, 5) is empty.\n        *   **Conclusion: RIGHT is SAFE.**\n    *   **UP to (8, 6):**\n        *   Is it safe? (8, 6) is within bounds. My body is at y=3 and 4. Enemy body is at (7,6), (6,6). (8,6) is empty.\n        *   **Conclusion: UP is SAFE.**\n\n4.  **Strategic Choice:**\n    *   I am in a tight spot. My only two safe moves are **RIGHT** (hitting the wall) and **UP** (into the open).\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (9, 5), I trap myself against the wall. I only have 2 options next turn (UP or DOWN). This is bad for mobility.\n    *   If I move **UP** to (8, 6), I stay on the right side but open up more board space. I can potentially loop around or go left later.\n    *   **The Enemy's Move:** He is at (7, 4). He likely wants to survive. He can't go UP (into his body at 7,5). He can't go LEFT (into 6,4? No, 6,4 is his body, but he is head at 7,4. Wait, body list is [(6,4)...]. So (6,4) is a body segment. If he goes LEFT to (6,4), he dies.\n    *   Enemy options: (7,3) DOWN, or (8,4) RIGHT.\n    *   If he goes RIGHT to (8,4), and I go UP to (8,6), no collision. We are far apart.\n    *   If he goes RIGHT to (8,4), and I go RIGHT to (9,5), no collision.\n    *   However, if he goes RIGHT to (8,4), he is moving into the space I just vacated.\n    *   **Wait!** If I move UP to (8,6), I leave the column x=8 open below me (except for my tail).\n    *   But the most important factor is survival. I cannot go LEFT or DOWN. I must go UP or RIGHT.\n    *   Going **UP** gives me more flexibility than being stuck on the wall at (9,5).\n    *   Also, there is an apple at (8,7). Moving UP puts me one step closer to that apple (and the apple at (7,8)).\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   **LEFT** = Death (into enemy body).\n    *   **DOWN** = Death (into self).\n    *   **RIGHT** = Safe, but limits mobility (wall).\n    *   **UP** = Safe, maintains options, moves toward apples (8,7).\n    *   **UP** is the winning move. It keeps me alive and in the game.\n\n**STRATEGIC NOTE:**\nPlan A: Get to the top row (y=9). The apple at (7,9) and (6,9) are juicy. I need to grow fast. I have to outmaneuver him. He is stuck in the bottom-left quadrant. I own the top-right.\n\nUP",

(+1 Score).\n    *   **RIGHT** leads to empty air.\n\n5.  **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   Enemy at (7,3). He can't go DOWN (off board). He can't go RIGHT (8,3) - is that open? Yes.\n    *   He will likely move UP to (7,4) or RIGHT to (8,3).\n    *   If I go UP to (8,7), we are far apart. No collision risk.\n\n6.  **Decision:** I need points. I need to close the 2-8 gap. **UP** gives me an apple and keeps me mobile in the top-right quadrant where I can dominate. Staying on the wall is bad. Hitting the wall is bad. UP is the play.\n\n**STRATEGIC NOTE:**\nEat the apple at (8,7) to grow. Once I grow, my tail stays at (8,4) for a moment. I'll need to plan a route to the top row (y=9) to get the apples at (7,9) and (6,9). I need to start circling or boxing the enemy in from the top. Don't get cornered on the right edge.\n\nUP",

We need to secure that apple at (7, 8) and set up a trap for the enemy.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the immediate threats:**\n    *   **My Body:** My tail is currently at (8, 4) because I grew last turn. The cell (8, 6) (my head) connects to (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3).\n    *   **Enemy:** Head at (8, 3). Body from (7, 3) down to (5, 6).\n    *   **Crucial Observation:** The enemy head is at (8, 3), directly below my tail at (8, 4). If I move DOWN to (8, 6), I die (into self). If I move LEFT to (7, 7), that's open air. If I move UP to (8, 8), that's empty space. If I move RIGHT to (9, 7), that's an apple.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 7):** There is an apple here. However, moving to the extreme right edge (9, 7) is dangerous. I will be pinned against the wall with limited mobility. I can't afford to get boxed in.\n    *   **UP (8, 8):** Safe. Opens up movement. Brings me closer to the top row apples.\n    *   **LEFT (7, 7):** Safe. But (7, 7) is empty. However, this sets me up perfectly.\n    *   **DOWN (8, 6):** **DEATH.** I crash into my own body. \ud83d\udeab\n\n3.  **Strategic Play & Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   **The Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (8, 3). They are likely to move UP to (8, 4). Wait! (8, 4) is currently my tail.\n    *   **The Trap:** If I move **LEFT** to (7, 7), my body shifts. My tail remains at (8, 4) for this turn. The enemy at (8, 3) looking up sees my tail at (8, 4).\n    *   **The Kill:** If the enemy moves UP into (8, 4), they crash into my body and die immediately. This is a free kill opportunity.\n    *   **Scoring:** Even if they don't move up, (7, 7) is a safe move that keeps me in the central area, away from the wall, and prepares me to grab the apple at (7, 8) or (7, 9) next turn.\n    *   **Comparison:** Moving RIGHT to (9, 7) grabs an apple but traps me. Moving LEFT gives me board control and a chance to eliminate the competition.\n\n4.  **Final Call:** I'm playing for the win, not just points. Eliminating the 8-apple snake is the priority. I will move **LEFT** to (7, 7). If Snake #0 blindly pushes forward, they are toast.\n\n**STRATEGIC NOTE:**\nHold the center. If the enemy moves up into my tail, I win instantly. If they retreat or move sideways, I have a clean line to the apple at (7, 8) or (6, 8) next turn. Don't get baited into the corner.\n\nLEFT",

Moving **UP** is the only move that guarantees growth.\n    *   **Safety Check:** If I move UP to (7, 8), where can the enemy go?\n        *   If Enemy moves UP to (9, 4): We are far apart.\n        *   If Enemy moves UP to (8, 4): They might be setting up for the (9, 4) apple next turn.\n        *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (8, 3): That's their own body (based on the list: [(8, 3)...]).\n    *   **The Risk:** Moving UP to (7, 8) puts my head in a line with the enemy's potential path. However, the enemy is currently at (9, 3). The Manhattan distance is large. They cannot reach (7, 8) in one turn.\n    *   **The Trap:** If the enemy moves UP to (9, 4), I am at (7, 8). Next turn, I can threaten them. If they stay low, I secure the top-left corner.\n\n4.  **Final Call:** I need points. I am 5 apples behind. Playing passively guarantees a loss. I must eat. The apple at (7, 8) is there for the taking. It is safe from immediate collision because the enemy is too far away to reach my head position. I will move **UP**.\n\n**STRATEGIC NOTE:**\nEat the apple at (7, 8) to close the gap to 4 apples. The enemy is stuck on the right side. Once I grow, I can pivot LEFT to (6, 8) or UP to (7, 9) to secure the cluster. Don't let them breathe. Apply pressure.\n\nUP",

We need to be AGGRESSIVE and cut off the enemy!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    *   **My Position:** Head at (7, 8). Body at [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5)]. Tail at (8, 5).\n    *   **Enemy Position:** Head at (9, 4). Body snakes across the bottom right and up to (7, 6). They are effectively \"boxed\" on the right edge.\n    *   **The Plan:** Last turn I moved UP to (7, 8) to eat the apple. Now I am positioned above the enemy's cluster. I need to move LEFT to cut off their escape route and dominate the center.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves:**\n    *   **UP (7, 9):** Safe. Opens up the top row. No immediate threat. But I can do better to pressure the enemy.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 7):** **DEATH.** My body is currently at (7, 7). Hitting myself instantly ends the stream. \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 8):** Safe. But this moves me back toward the right edge where the enemy is. I want to push them into the corner, not join them.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 8):** **PERFECT.** This is the power move.\n        *   **Safety:** It's clear. My body is at (7, 7) and (8, 7), etc. (6, 8) is empty.\n        *   **Strategy:** This moves me to (6, 8), putting me directly in the path between the enemy at (9, 4) and the apples at (2, 7), (3, 7), and (3, 9). I am stealing their food source!\n        *   **The Trap:** By moving LEFT, I force the enemy to stay on the right side. If they try to cross to the left, they have to navigate around my growing body. If they stay right, they are trapped in a smaller and smaller area.\n\n3.  **Long-Term Plan:**\n    *   Secure the center (x=6).\n    *   Prepare to move UP to (6, 9) or LEFT to (5, 8) next turn to further block the enemy's access to the top-left apples.\n    *   Keep the pressure on.

          "rationale": "**WHAT'S GOOD CHAT!** Turn 21 and we are LIVE! We're down 5 to 9 apples, but the board is opening up. The enemy snake is still chilling on the right side, but I'm positioned in the center to cut him off. Last turn I moved LEFT to (6, 8), placing myself as a wall between the enemy and the apples on the left. Now I need to keep the pressure on and secure more territory.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    *   **My Position:** Head at (6, 8). Body is at (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5). Tail is at (8, 5).\n    *   **Enemy Position:** Head at (9, 5). Body stretches back to (7, 6). They are still confined to the right side of the board (columns 7-9).\n    *   **The Plan:** I need to block the enemy's vertical movement on the right side and prepare to snatch the apple at (5, 7) or move upwards to cut off the top right corner.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves:**\n    *   **UP (6, 9):** **POTENTIAL WINNER.** This moves me to the top row.\n        *   **Safety:** The cell (6, 9) is currently empty on the board view (looks like an 'A' or empty in the text description, let's check the map). Looking at the map row 9: `9 . . . A . . A A . .`. Wait, the text says `APPLE DROPS: (7, 9), (6, 9)...`. If I move UP, I will eat the apple at (6, 9). I grow. My tail (8, 5) will not move until I eat.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** This places me directly above the enemy's cluster. I cut off the top right completely. I also secure an apple to narrow the score gap (6 vs 9).\n        *   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy is at (9, 5). Their best move is probably LEFT or UP/Down to chase food. They cannot reach (6, 9). No head-on collision risk here.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 7):**\n        *   **Safety:** Cell (6, 7) is currently empty (Map shows row 7: `7 . A A A . A . T T A` - it's a dot). Safe to move.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me closer to the apple at (5, 7). However, (6, 7) is effectively \"inside\" my own perimeter. It's safe but less dominant than UP. It keeps me on the same horizontal plane as the enemy.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 8):**\n        *   **Safety:** Cell (5, 8) is empty.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me further into the center. Good for chasing the apple at (3, 7) or (2, 7) eventually, but it gives up the top row to the enemy if they choose to go UP. I prefer to hold the high ground.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 8):**\n        *   **Safety:** **DEATH.** My body is currently at (7, 8) from the previous turn. I would be moving directly into myself. Game over. \ud83d\udeab\n\n3.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   Moving **UP** is the only move that secures a point immediately (apple at 6,9) while simultaneously blocking the enemy's access to the top right corner. It expands my territory and keeps me safe from the enemy's current position.\n    *   I need those points to catch up. 6 apples vs 9 is manageable if I dominate the board space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the top right corner (row 9). Once the apple at (6,9) is eaten, look to move LEFT to (5,9) or (5,8) to block the enemy's path to the top-left apples. Force the enemy down into the bottom right trap zone.\n\n**LETS GOOO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**WHAT'S GOOD CHAT!** Turn 22 and we are LIVE! I'm currently sitting at 6 apples versus the enemy's 9, so we have some catching up to do. My head is at (6, 9) after a solid move UP last turn. I managed to secure that apple, which is great. Now, looking at the board state, the enemy snake is still largely confined to the right side, but I need to maintain my position at the top to block their access. I'm currently at the top-left corner of their potential territory, so I need to pivot carefully to cut off their escape routes.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    *   **My Position:** Head at (6, 9). Body is at [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5)].\n    *   **Enemy Position:** Head at (9, 6). Body stretches back to (7, 5). They are trying to navigate the right side of the board.\n    *   **Available Moves:** UP is out of bounds. RIGHT would lead into my own body at (7, 9). LEFT leads to (5, 9). DOWN leads to (6, 8).\n\n2.  **Evaluating Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** Impossible. Top of the board. Dead.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 9):** My body is currently at (7, 8), (8, 7), etc. The cell (7, 9) is empty according to the map, but wait, looking closely at the map: `9 . . . A . . 1 A . .` (this was the previous state). In the new state, I'm at (6, 9). My body is at (7, 8). So (7, 9) is actually free. **BUT**, moving RIGHT takes me away from the enemy. The enemy is at (9, 6). If I move RIGHT to (7, 9), I am moving parallel to the enemy's potential path but not blocking them effectively.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 9):** This is interesting. It moves me further left along the top wall. The cell (5, 9) is empty. This keeps me on the top row, cutting off the top right corner. It also moves me closer to the apple at (3, 9) eventually.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 8):** This is the move I made last turn to get here. My body is currently occupying (6, 8). Moving DOWN would be moving into my own body. That is a collision. **DEATH.**\n\n3.  **Refining the Analysis (Self-Correction):**\n    *   Let's look at the map again.\n    *   `9 . . . A . . 1 A . .` (Wait, I need to visualize the current board based on the update).\n    *   **Map:**\n        ```\n         9 . . . A . . 1 A . .\n         8 . . . . . . T T . .\n         7 . A A A .

A . . . . . . .\n           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        ```\n    *   My head is at (6, 9).\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 9):** The map shows an 'A' at (7, 9) in the `APPLE DROPS` list. If I move RIGHT, I eat that apple. I grow. My tail (8, 5) stays. The cell (7, 9) is an apple, not a body part. Is it safe? Yes, no other snake is there.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 9):** The map shows (5, 9) as '.' (empty). No apple there.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 8):** As established, (6, 8) is my body. Dead.\n    *   **UP:** Out of bounds. Dead.\n\n    *   **Wait, re-reading the prompt rules:** \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins.\" This is a dangerous scenario.\n    *   **Head-on Collision Check:** The enemy is at (9, 6). If I move RIGHT to (7, 9), the enemy might move UP to (9, 7). No collision. If the enemy moves LEFT to (8, 6), no collision. If the enemy moves UP to (9, 7) or (8, 7), no collision.\n    *   **Wait, let's look at the apple list again.** `(7, 9)` is an apple. `(9, 7)` is an apple.\n    *   The enemy is at (9, 6). Their potential moves:\n        *   UP: (9, 7) -> **Apple!** They grow.\n        *   LEFT: (8, 6) -> My body is at (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)... (8, 6) is my body! If the enemy moves LEFT to (8, 6), they hit my body and DIE.\n        *   DOWN: (9, 5) -> My body is at (8, 5). (9, 5) is empty.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 9) and eat the apple, I grow.\n    *   If the enemy moves LEFT to (8, 6), they die.\n    *   If the enemy moves UP to (9, 7), they eat an apple and live.\n    *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (9, 5), they live.\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT (Out of bounds), they die.\n\n    *   **Strategy:** I am currently blocking the top row. If I stay at (6, 9), I am a wall. But I have an apple at (7, 9). Eating it gives me a point (7 apples vs 9). It also extends my body. My tail is at (8, 5). If I move RIGHT, my body will shift. My head becomes (7, 9). My body becomes (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8)...\n    *   Let's check safety of (7, 9). It's an apple. It's empty.\n    *   Is (7, 9) safe from the enemy *next* turn? If I go to (7, 9), I can move DOWN to (7, 8) or LEFT to (6, 9) or UP/RIGHT (blocked).\n    *   If I stay at (6, 9) without moving, I can't. I must move.\n    *   **UP/RIGHT/DOWN/LEFT.**\n    *   UP: Dead.\n    *   DOWN: Dead (into body).\n    *   LEFT: Safe. (5, 9). No apple.\n    *   RIGHT: Safe. (7, 9). **Apple.**\n\n    *   Eating the apple is crucial to close the gap (6 vs 9). However, I must ensure I don't trap myself.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 9):\n        *   My body becomes: Head (7, 9), then (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8)...\n        *   The path forward is blocked by the wall at (8, 9) and (9, 9).\n        *   My only safe moves next turn would be LEFT (back to 6,9) or DOWN (to 7,8).\n        *   Down (7, 8) is currently my body. Wait, if I move to (7, 9), my old head (6, 9) becomes the new neck. The old neck (6, 8) becomes the body.\n        *   So next turn, (7, 8) will be the 3rd segment of my body. (6, 9) will be the 2nd segment (neck).\n        *   If I move DOWN from (7, 9) to (7, 8), I will be moving into my own body (which will be there at the start of next turn). So DOWN is death next turn.\n        *   If I move LEFT from (7, 9) to (6, 9), I will be moving into my neck. That is also death (hitting yourself).\n        *   **Wait.** If I move to (7, 9), I am effectively cornering myself at the top right corner. I would be forced to move DOWN into my own body (since LEFT is neck, RIGHT/UP are walls).\n        *   **CORRECTION:** If I am at (7, 9):\n            *   Next turn options:\n                *   LEFT (6, 9): My neck will be there. **DEATH**.\n                *   DOWN (7, 8): My body will be there. **DEATH**.\n                *   UP (7, 10): **DEATH** (Bounds).\n                *   RIGHT (8, 9): **DEATH** (Bounds? No, bounds are 0-9. (8, 9) is valid. Wait, is it a wall?)\n            *   Looking at the map: `9 . . .

Can the enemy get to (7, 9)?\n        *   Enemy path: (9, 6) -> (9, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 9).\n        *   My body occupies (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5).

I can only go DOWN to (9, 8).\n        *   (9, 8) is currently empty.\n        *   This is a very tight corridor. It is risky.\n        *   However, the prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" My score is 6, enemy is 9. I do NOT have a higher score.\n        *   So I should NOT force a head-on collision. I should play safe.\n\n    *   **Comparing (5, 9) vs (7, 9):**\n        *   (5, 9): Safer, more room to move. No apple.\n        *   (7, 9): Apple, but cornered.\n        *   Given my lower score, I need to survive. If I die, I lose.\n        *   If I go to (7, 9) and get stuck, the enemy might cut off my escape.\n        *   Let's check (5, 9) again.\n        *   From (5, 9), I can go DOWN to (5, 8).\n        *   (5, 8) is empty.\n        *   From (5, 8), I can go DOWN to (5, 7) (Apple!), LEFT to (4, 8), or UP to (5, 9) (Death).\n        *   This looks like a good route. I can go (5, 9) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 7) -> Eat Apple.\n        *   The apple at (5, 7) is available.\n\n    *   **Wait, look at the board state again.**\n        *   `7 . A A A . A . T T A`\n        *   (5, 7) is an apple (the dot is (4, 7)? No, the map is slightly confusing textually.\n        *   `APPLE DROPS: ... (5, 7)...`\n        *   Yes, (5, 7) is an apple.\n        *   My plan: Move LEFT to (5, 9). Next turn DOWN to (5, 8). Next turn DOWN to (5, 7) and eat the apple.\n        *   This seems like a solid plan. It avoids the immediate trap at the top right.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating the \"Box In\" strategy.**\n        *   The prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in\".\n        *   I am at (6, 9). The enemy is at (9, 6).\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 9), I am closer to the enemy.\n        *   If I move LEFT to (5, 9), I am moving away.\n        *   However, boxing him in requires me to control the space *around* him.\n        *   The top right corner (9,9) is a trap for *me*. If I go there, I die.\n        *   I should use my body to block his path, not my head.\n        *   My body is currently blocking (7, 8), (8, 7), etc.\n        *   If I move LEFT, my body shifts. (6, 9) becomes a body part.\n        *   (6, 9) is a wall.\n        *   The enemy is at (9, 6). He wants to go to the apples at (7, 9) or (9, 7).\n        *   If I go to (5, 9), I leave (7, 9) open.\n        *   BUT, (7, 9) is an apple. If the enemy takes it, he grows.\n        *   However, (7, 9) is a dead end.\n        *   If the enemy goes to (7, 9), he traps himself.\n        *   **Let the enemy trap himself.**\n        *   I should take the safe path (5, 9) and secure the (5, 7) apple safely.\n\n    *   **Final check on (7, 9).**\n        *   Head (7, 9). Neck (6, 9). Body (6, 8)...\n        *   Next turn from (7, 9):\n        *   I can go LEFT (6, 9) -> Death (Neck).\n        *   I can go DOWN (7, 8) -> Death (Body).\n        *   I can go RIGHT (8, 9) -> Safe.\n        *   I can go UP -> Death.\n        *   So I *must* go RIGHT to (8, 9).\n        *   From (8, 9):\n        *   I can go LEFT (7, 9) -> Death (Old Head).\n        *   I can go DOWN (8, 8) -> Safe? (8, 8) is currently empty.\n        *   I can go RIGHT (9, 9) -> Safe.\n        *   I can go UP -> Death.\n        *   From (9, 9):\n        *   I can go LEFT (8, 9) -> Death.\n        *   I can go DOWN (9, 8) -> Safe.\n        *   I can go RIGHT -> Death.\n        *   I can go UP -> Death.\n        *   This path is extremely dangerous. It's a linear tunnel. If the enemy cuts me off at (9, 8) or (8, 8), I'm dead.\n        *   My score is lower (6 vs 9). I cannot afford risky plays that lead to death traps. I need points, but I need to live.\n\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   Move **LEFT** to (5, 9).\n        *   This is the safest move. It keeps my options open.\n        *   It avoids immediate death (unlike DOWN or UP).\n        *   It avoids the corner trap (unlike RIGHT).\n        *   It sets up a safe path to the apple at (5, 7).\n\n    *   **Long Term Plan:**\n        *   Move LEFT to (5, 9).\n        *   Next turn: DOWN to (5, 8).\n        *   Next turn: DOWN to (5, 7) -> Eat Apple.\n        *   Keep the enemy blocked on the right side using my body length.\n        *   Wait for the enemy to make a mistake or get trapped.\n\n    *   **Wait, check the board map one more time.**\n    *   `9 . . . A . . 1 A . .`\n    *   (6, 9) is my head.\n    *   (5, 9) is '.'.\n    *   (7, 9) is 'A'.\n    *   The apple at (7, 9) is tempting, but the geometry of the board (top right corner) makes it a death trap.\n    *   The prompt emphasizes: \"avoid getting trapped in tight spaces\".\n    *   Therefore, LEFT is the superior choice.\n\n    *   **Head-on collision check:**\n        *   Enemy at (9, 6).\n        *   If I move LEFT to (5, 9).\n        *   Enemy moves?\n        *   If Enemy moves UP to (9, 7). Safe.\n        *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (8, 6). Safe? (8, 6) is currently my body (specifically, my body is at (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)... wait, let's check my body).\n        *   My body: `[(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5)]`\n        *   Yes, (8, 6) is my body.\n        *   If the enemy moves LEFT to (8, 6), they die by hitting my body.\n        *   This is good for me.\n        *   If the enemy moves UP to (9, 7), they eat an apple.\n        *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (9, 5), they are safe.\n        *   If I move LEFT, I am not colliding with the enemy this turn.\n\n    *   **Confidence check.**\n        *   LEFT is safe.\n        *   LEFT sets up future points.\n        *   LEFT avoids traps.\n        *   LEFT is the play.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the center-left territory. Move to (5, 9) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 7) to eat the apple there. Use my body length to wall off the right side of the board, forcing the enemy into tight corners. Prioritize survival over risky apple grabs. Let the enemy make the first mistake.\n\nLEFT",

But I move away from the apple at (5, 7).\n    *   **DOWN (5, 8):** Safe. Moves me closer to the apple at (5, 7).\n\n4.  **The Play:**\n    *   I need apples to catch up. The apple at (5, 7) is right there.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (5, 8) positions me perfectly to eat that apple next turn.\n    *   Is it risky? Let's check the enemy. Enemy is at (9, 6). They are far away. They can't hit me this turn.\n    *   Will I trap myself? If I go DOWN to (5, 8), next turn I can go DOWN to (5, 7) (Eat apple), or LEFT to (4, 8), or RIGHT to (6, 8).\n    *   (6, 8) is currently my body, but by the time I'm at (5, 8), my old tail will have moved, so (6, 8) might be free... wait, let's check.\n        *   Current Body: (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8)...\n        *   If I move DOWN to (5, 8):\n            *   New Head: (5, 8)\n            *   Old Head becomes Neck: (5, 9)\n            *   Old Neck becomes Body: (6, 9)\n            *   Old Body moves: (6, 8) stays? No, the tail moves from (8, 5).\n            *   So (6, 8) will still be part of my body in the next turn.\n    *   Therefore, if I go DOWN to (5, 8), I cannot go RIGHT to (6, 8) next turn (into self).\n    *   However, I can go DOWN to (5, 7) (Apple!) or LEFT to (4, 8).\n    *   This is good. I have options.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing **DOWN** is the aggressive move. It grabs territory and sets up an apple eat. Staying at (5, 9) or going LEFT delays the apple and lets the enemy grow. We need those points. Let's feast. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 8) -> DOWN to (5, 7) to eat the apple. Keep using my body to wall off the top row. Force the enemy into the tight bottom-right corner.\n\nDOWN",

Let's break this down.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n\n1.  **Current State:**\n    *   **My Head:** (5, 8)\n    *   **My Body:** [(5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (9, 8)\n    *   **Enemy Body:** [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]\n    *   **Apples:** (5, 7) is right below me! I need this to catch up (6 vs 10 apples).\n\n2.  **Safety Check (Where can I go?):**\n    *   **UP to (5, 9):** DEAD. That's my neck/body. Moving backwards is suicide.\n    *   **DOWN to (5, 7):** SAFE (for now). It's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 8):** SAFE.\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 8):** DEAD. That's part of my body. I'm threading through myself here.\n\n3.  **The Critical Move (DOWN to 5, 7):**\n    *   I'm moving into the apple at (5, 7).\n    *   **Growth:** I grow by 1. My tail (8, 7) won't move this turn. This effectively adds a barrier at (8, 7).\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy is at (9, 8). Where are they going?\n        *   If they go **LEFT to (8, 8)**, they hit my body (current (6, 8) becomes part of the path, but more importantly, I'm growing at (5, 7) and my neck is at (5, 9). They are far enough they probably won't hit me immediately, but (8, 8) is a dangerous spot for them.\n        *   If they go **UP to (9, 9)**, they are safe.\n        *   If they go **DOWN to (9, 7)**, they are safe (it's their own body, but the tail moves).\n    *   **Future Options:** If I eat the apple at (5, 7):\n        *   My new head is (5, 7).\n        *   My body is now: (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7).\n        *   Next turn options from (5, 7):\n            *   DOWN to (5, 6): SAFE.\n            *   LEFT to (4, 7): SAFE.\n            *   RIGHT to (6, 7): SAFE? Let's check. (6, 7) is currently empty on the board (it's '.' in the list). My body is at (6, 8) and (7, 8). So (6, 7) is free!\n            *   UP to (5, 8): DEAD (into my new neck).\n    *   **Trapping Myself?** No. By eating the apple, I actually gain length, but more importantly, I secure the point and stay in the center/left side. The enemy is hard-pressed on the right.\n\n4.  **The Strategy:**\n    *   We are behind 6 to 10. We MUST eat apples.\n    *   The apple at (5, 7) is the safest, most immediate gain.\n    *   Moving DOWN forces the enemy to react. If I stay at (5, 8) or move LEFT, I'm wasting time. The enemy might snake around and block that apple.\n    *   **Aggression:** Taking the apple right now is the best way to close the gap. Once I eat, I'll be 7-10. Still behind, but momentum is shifting.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **DOWN** to (5, 7). Eat the apple. Grow. Assert dominance. The enemy is on the far right; let's secure the center and the apple before they can even think about it.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat apple at (5, 7) -> Analyze enemy movement -> Prepare to sweep the bottom rows or flank the right side. We need to start cutting off their space.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 25! We just ate the apple at (5, 7) and grew. Let's analyze the board and secure the W.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My New Head:** (5, 7)\n*   **My New Body:** [(5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (9, 9) (He likely went UP to avoid hitting his own tail or me).\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]\n*   **Score:** 7 vs 10. Still behind, but we're growing.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (Where can I go?):**\n1.  **UP to (5, 8):** DEAD. That's my neck/body. Moving backwards is suicide.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 6):** SAFE. It's an open space (Board shows a '.' there).\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 7):** SAFE. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):** SAFE. Open space.\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\nI have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n*   **LEFT (4, 7):** This moves me away from the enemy (who is at 9,9) and deeper into the left side. This is safer but isolates me from the apple at (3, 9) and the dense apple cluster on the right side where the enemy is.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 7):** This moves me closer to the right side and the enemy. It's an open space, but it might bring me closer to a confrontation.\n*   **DOWN (5, 6):** This is the move. Why?\n    *   It opens up the bottom row for me. Looking at the board, row 0 has an apple at (2, 0). Row 1 has an apple at (1, 1). Row 2 has an apple at (9, 2).\n    *   Moving DOWN positions me to sweep the bottom rows, which seem relatively untouched compared to the chaotic right side.\n    *   The enemy is at the very top right (9, 9). They are forced to deal with their own tail length (11 segments). By going DOWN, I avoid the immediate collision zone and give myself space to breathe and plan a flank.\n    *   From (5, 6), I can go LEFT to (4, 6), DOWN to (5, 5), or RIGHT to (6, 6). All are open. I maintain maximum flexibility.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the bottom-left area. The enemy is bloated and trapped in the top-right corner. I will grow by eating the apples on the bottom rows (specifically targeting (2, 0) and (1, 1)), then loop back up to cut off the center. I need to dominate the board, not just chase apples. Force the enemy into a tight space where they eventually crash.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **DOWN** to (5, 6). We take the space, we stay safe, we set up the sweep.\n\nDOWN",
