Right now, NONE of these four would instantly kill me, but LEFT would snap into my tail if not careful; still it\u2019s legal because the tail moves away.\n- 3) Among the safe options, pick ones that keep future options open and aim toward aggressive growth while avoiding a head-on collision unless I have the advantage.\n- 4) Prioritize moves that set up a stronger top-side position to pressure the opponent while I chase apples to close the apples-gap.\n\nSafe moves (from (8,8)):\n- UP -> to (8,9) (eats apple there, grows)\n- DOWN -> to (8,7) (no apple)\n- LEFT -> to (7,8) (into tail; still safe with tail movement)\n- RIGHT -> to (9,8) (no apple)\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP this turn to (8,9) to grab the top-right apple and grow to length 3. This also stacks options for next turns and keeps me near more apples on the top edge.

He has three safe choices: Up to (1,2), Down to (1,0), or Left to (0,1). Nothing immediate that constrains us right now, but we want to keep options open and avoid giving him a direct path to crash into us.\n- Score reality: you\u2019re at 3 apples, him at 4.

We\u2019ll stay smart and keep multiple escape routes.\n\nLong-term plan for the next few turns:\n- Stay in the upper-middle area but not pinned to the wall. Maintain at least two safe continuations after each move (don\u2019t zig into your own body or a corner).\n- Push toward central lanes to siphon potential escapes around him while avoiding a trap that could corner you against the edge or against your own body.\n- If an opportunity presents to force a controlled head-on collision without losing more apples than he does, we\u2019ll take it\u2014but not while we\u2019re behind on score.\n- Keep an eye on growth opportunities that don\u2019t trap us: we\u2019re prioritizing movement space over aggressive apple shagging right now.\n\nImmediate move choice (turn 8):\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "\ud83e\udd14 I\u2019m reviewing turn\u202f13 after eating that juicy apple at (2,3) \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5.  \nI need to keep my options open while hunting the dense apple cluster around y\u202f=\u202f5\u20117 \ud83c\udf1f.  \nUp leads to (2,4) which is empty but sets up a straight climb to the cluster \ud83d\ude80.  \nRight would keep us on the same x\u2011axis but also lands on (3,3) which has no apple but stays clear of my tail and the opponent\u2019s head \ud83d\udea7.  \nDown is tempting because my tail currently occupies (1,1) and (1,2) but moving down would place my head on (2,2) which is part of my own body? Wait my tail includes (1,2) and (0,2) etc. Actually (2,2) is not part of my body; it\u2019s empty, so down is safe but may trap me later \ud83e\udd14.  \nLeft would head back toward my own body segment at (0,3) which is an immediate collision \ud83d\udc80. So left is out, no doubt! \u2705  \nI also must avoid driving into the opponent\u2019s predicted path; his head is at (8,5) moving mostly horizontally, so I can ignore him for now \ud83d\udc40.  \nGrowing to length\u202f7 will give me a safety buffer for the next few turns when I dive into the apple field \ud83c\udf08.  \nIf I go up now, I\u2019ll be at (2,4) and still have three safe exits: up, right, down, keeping the board open \ud83d\udd04.  \nIf I go right, I\u2019ll be at (3,3) and still have up, right, down as well, but I\u2019ll be closer to the apple at (3,5) and (4,6) \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd0d.  \nDo I want to waste a turn moving sideways when a vertical line of apples awaits? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  \nI think climbing upward maximizes apple proximity and keeps my growth trajectory straight \ud83d\udcc8.  \nHowever, going right also positions me to block the enemy\u2019s potential descent into the central corridor later on, which could set up a trap \ud83c\udfaf.  \nMy future\u2011plan note: I\u2019ll aim to reach (2,5) by turn\u202f14, then (2,6) by turn\u202f15, capturing apples at (2,5) and (2,6) while staying out of the opponent\u2019s line of fire \ud83d\udd25.  \nI\u2019ll keep an eye on his head movement; if he heads toward (2,5) I can pivot and bite him head\u2011on when our lengths differ by >1 \ud83d\udcaa.  \nSo I\u2019ll choose the move that preserves the most exits and heads toward the nearest apple cluster \ud83c\udf4f.  \nRight now the safest and most rewarding move is **UP** to (2,4) \ud83c\udf1f.  \nUP",

RIGHT would nail you into your own neck (8,2) \u2013 not safe.\n\nANALYSIS:\n- RIGHT is dead, so ruled out.\n- UP (7,3) keeps you in the clear and keeps the center open for future lanes.\n- DOWN (7,1) heads toward the bottom apple cluster (easier grab potential with (5,1) and (0,0) later), but risks getting pinched near the tail if the board tightens around you.\n- LEFT (6,2) shifts you toward the apple at (6,4) as a short-term target (two moves away: (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (6,4)). It also distances you from the rival and keeps multiple escape routes open.\n\nSTRATEGY RATIONALE:\n- We\u2019re ahead by 1 apple; we should press to expand our control and grab nearby apples while staying flexible. LEFT lines you up to snag (6,4) soon and maintains a safe corridor on the right side of the board, making a future trap more plausible without risking immediate head-on with Snake 0.\n- The enemy is parked at (3,6) with a left-side cluster; boxing him in this turn isn\u2019t instantly feasible, so a cautious but aggressive shift toward apples and open lanes is best. UP would be neutral; DOWN dives toward a different apple pool but could invite a chase or corner risk. LEFT keeps the pressure while keeping escape options.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to position (6,2). Then aim for (6,3) on turn after next, reaching (6,4) to claim the apple there.\n- Maintain the right-hand corridor as a safety valve; avoid zig-zagging into the left-hand cluster where Snake 0 is; stay multi-directional so you can pivot to avoid potential head-ons.\n- If Snake 0 makes a mistake or heads into your path, exploit it with calculated cuts rather than chasing blindly; still prioritize apples to widen the lead.\n\nFinal move: \nFinal move: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

There\u2019s an apple at (4,8) and (5,8) waiting to be grabbed.\n- Opponent is parked on the left/top; no immediate head-on risk this turn, so we don\u2019t gamble the safety for nothing.\n\nShort-term plan if we go UP now:\n- Turn 24: head to (4,7).\n- Turn 25: push to (4,8) to eat the apple there, growing and extending our leash.\n- After that, weave through the central/top corridor to threaten more apples around (5,8), (7,8), etc., always watching the opponent\u2019s lane so you don\u2019t get boxed in.\n\nLonger-term vibe:\n- Use center control to threaten Apple-rich zones while keeping clear of the left edge.\n- If an opening appears for a tempting head-on, weigh it\u2014our current score deficit is small, but play to survive and grow first, then lock in the fight.\n\nFINAL NOTE: Stay aggressive, stay safe, farm apples, and keep that central corridor alive.
