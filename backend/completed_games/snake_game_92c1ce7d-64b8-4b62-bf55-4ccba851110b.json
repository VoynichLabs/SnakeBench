Possible moves for enemy:\n- UP: (2, 9)\n- DOWN: (2, 7)\n- LEFT: (1, 8)\n- RIGHT: (3, 8)\n\nPotential collisions:\n- If I move UP to (1, 8) and enemy moves LEFT to (1, 8), we collide and both die\n- If I move RIGHT to (2, 7) and enemy moves DOWN to (2, 7), we collide and both die\n\nLet me think about apple targets:\n- (2, 5): Distance from me = |1-2| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- (5, 7): Distance from me = |1-5| + |7-7| = 4 + 0 = 4\n- (6, 0): Far away\n- (7, 5): Distance = 6 + 2 = 8\n- (7, 6): Distance = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nThe closest apple to me is (2, 5). To get there, I need to go RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's likely move:\n- The enemy at (2, 8) might go for apple at (2, 5) as well, which would require going DOWN\n- Or they might go for (5, 7), which is also nearby\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 6), I'm safe from collision and moving toward apple (2, 5).\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 7), I'm safe but moving away from apples.\nIf I move UP to (1, 8), there's a risk of collision if enemy moves LEFT.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 7), there's a risk of collision if enemy moves DOWN.\n\nThe safest moves that also make progress toward apples are:\n1. DOWN to (1, 6) - safe, moves toward (2, 5)\n2. RIGHT to (2, 7) - risky if enemy moves DOWN, but gets closer to (5, 7)\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The enemy at (2, 8) is directly above the apple at (2, 5). They might want to go DOWN to get to that apple. That makes RIGHT risky for me.\n\nThe apple at (5, 7) is on the same row as me. If I go RIGHT, I'm heading toward it, but there's collision risk with enemy.\n\nI think DOWN is the safest play here. It avoids collision risk and moves me toward the apple at (2, 5).\n\nWait, let me double-check the positions:\n- My head: (1, 7)\n- Enemy head: (2, 8)\n\nIf I go UP: (1, 8) - enemy could go to (1, 8) by moving LEFT\nIf I go DOWN: (1, 6) - safe\nIf I go LEFT: (0, 7) - safe\nIf I go RIGHT: (2, 7) - enemy could go to (2, 7) by moving DOWN\n\nActually, I should think about what the enemy might do rationally:\n- The enemy at (2, 8) is close to apple (2, 5). To get there, they'd go DOWN.\n- They're also relatively close to apple (5, 7). To get there from (2, 8), they'd go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nGiven this, I think DOWN is the safest move for me. It avoids the two collision scenarios (enemy moving LEFT to (1,8) or DOWN to (2,7)).\n\nPlan for next few turns:\n- Move DOWN toward (2, 5) apple\n- Then RIGHT to collect it\n- After that, consider the apples at (7, 5), (7, 6), or (5, 7)\n\nLet me go with DOWN.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\nMy head is at (1, 7) and the enemy snake head is at (2, 8).\n\nLet me analyze each possible move:\n- **UP to (1, 8)**: Risky - enemy could move LEFT to (1, 8), causing a head-on collision\n- **DOWN to (1, 6)**: Safe - no collision risk, moves me toward apple at (2, 5)\n- **LEFT to (0, 7)**: Safe but moves away from all apples\n- **RIGHT to (2, 7)**: Risky - enemy could move DOWN to (2, 7), causing a head-on collision\n\nClosest apples to me:\n- (2, 5) is 3 moves away (1 right, 2 down)\n- (5, 7) is 4 moves away (4 right)\n\nThe enemy at (2, 8) is positioned above the apple at (2, 5) and might want to go DOWN toward it. This makes both UP and RIGHT risky due to potential collision.\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\n1. Move DOWN toward the apple at (2, 5)\n2. Then move RIGHT to collect it\n3. After securing that apple, head toward the cluster at (7, 5) and (7, 6)\n\nThe safest move that also makes progress toward an apple is DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

A . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head is at (1, 6). Let me check possible moves:\n- UP: (1, 7) - safe, no obstacles\n- DOWN: (1, 5) - safe, no obstacles\n- LEFT: (0, 6) - safe, no obstacles\n- RIGHT: (2, 6) - safe, no obstacles\n\nSince I have no body, none of these moves would hit my own body.\n\nEnemy snake head is at (2, 9). Possible moves for enemy:\n- UP: (2, 10) - out of bounds, death\n- DOWN: (2, 8) - safe\n- LEFT: (1, 9) - safe\n- RIGHT: (3, 9) - safe\n\nSo the enemy will likely go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. They won't go UP as that's death.\n\nLet me think about collision risks:\n- If I move UP to (1, 7), the enemy would need to be at (1, 7) too. Enemy can't reach (1, 7) in one move from (2, 9).\n- If I move DOWN to (1, 5), enemy can't reach (1, 5) in one move.\n- If I move LEFT to (0, 6), enemy can't reach (0, 6) in one move.\n- If I move RIGHT to (2, 6), enemy can't reach (2, 6) in one move.\n\nSo all moves are safe from head-on collision this turn.\n\nNow let me think about apple targets:\n- (2, 5): Distance from me = |1-2| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2 - Very close!\n- (5, 7): Distance from me = |1-5| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- (7, 5): Distance = |1-7| + |6-5| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- (7, 6): Distance = |1-7| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6\n- (6, 0): Far away\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 5). I'm at (1, 6). To get there:\n- Move RIGHT to (2, 6), then DOWN to (2, 5) - 2 moves\n- Move DOWN to (1, 5), then RIGHT to (2, 5) - 2 moves\n\nBoth paths are equally efficient.\n\nThe enemy at (2, 9) is far from this apple. Distance from enemy to (2, 5) = |2-2| + |9-5| = 0 + 4 = 4 moves. So I can probably get there first.\n\nLet me consider my strategy:\n1. Go for the apple at (2, 5) first - it's the closest\n2. After that, consider the apples at (5, 7), (7, 5), (7, 6) which are in a cluster\n\nFor this turn, either RIGHT or DOWN would be good moves toward (2, 5).\n\nLet me think about which is better:\n- RIGHT to (2, 6): Then next turn I can go DOWN to (2, 5) and get the apple\n- DOWN to (1, 5): Then next turn I can go RIGHT to (2, 5) and get the apple\n\nBoth are equally good for getting the apple. Let me think about what happens after...\n\nIf I go RIGHT then DOWN:\n- After collecting apple at (2, 5), I'll be at (2, 5) with body at (2, 6)\n- From there, I can go toward (5, 7) or the (7, 5)/(7, 6) cluster\n\nIf I go DOWN then RIGHT:\n- After collecting apple at (2, 5), I'll be at (2, 5) with body at (1, 5)\n- From there, I can go toward the same targets\n\nHmm, let me think about the enemy's likely strategy. The enemy at (2, 9) might go for:\n- (5, 7) - distance = |2-5| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- (2, 5) - distance = 4\n\nThe enemy might also try to cut me off or go for other apples.\n\nI think DOWN is a good move. It moves me toward the apple at (2, 5) and keeps me away from the enemy.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The apple at (2, 5) is at position (2, 5). If I go DOWN now to (1, 5), I'll be on the same row as the apple. Then RIGHT to (2, 5) collects it.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 6), I'll be directly above the apple. Then DOWN to (2, 5) collects it.\n\nEither way works. Let me think about which gives better positioning afterward...\n\nAfter getting (2, 5):\n- If I approached via DOWN then RIGHT, my body will be at (1, 5) when my head is at (2, 5)\n- If I approached via RIGHT then DOWN, my body will be at (2, 6) when my head is at (2, 5)\n\nFrom (2, 5), to get to the next closest apples:\n- (5, 7) is at distance 3+2=5\n- (7, 5) is at distance 5+0=5\n- (7, 6) is at distance 5+1=6\n\nIf my body is at (2, 6), I can't go UP immediately after getting the apple. I'd have to go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\nIf my body is at (1, 5), I can't go LEFT immediately after getting the apple. I'd have to go UP, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nTo head toward the cluster at (7, 5)/(7, 6), I'd want to go RIGHT. Both body positions allow going RIGHT.\n\nI think I'll go with DOWN this turn, as it continues my previous strategy and the enemy is far enough that I don't need to worry about collision.\n\nActually wait, let me re-read the board state. The board shows:\n```\n 9 . . 0 . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . A . . . .\n 6 . 1 . . . . . A . .\n 5 . . A . . . . A . .\n```\n\nSo my head \"1\" is at position (1, 6). The apple \"A\" at row 5, column 2 is at (2, 5). That's correct.\n\nMy possible moves:\n- UP to (1, 7): Moves toward apple at (5, 7)\n- DOWN to (1, 5): Moves toward apple at (2, 5)\n- LEFT to (0, 6): Moves away from apples\n- RIGHT to (2, 6): Moves toward apple at (2, 5) and (7, 6)\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT make sense. Let me go with DOWN since it follows my previous plan.\n\nWait, I should double-check: if I go DOWN to (1, 5), the next turn I need to go RIGHT to (2, 5) to collect the apple. That's 2 moves total.\n\nActually, hold on. Let me think about this more carefully. The apple at (2, 5) - from my current position (1, 6):\n- Going DOWN puts me at (1, 5) - same row as apple, one column to the left\n- Going RIGHT puts me at (2, 6) - same column as apple, one row above\n\nBoth are equidistant. I'll go with DOWN to stay with my previous strategy.\n\nActually, I realize I should think about the enemy more. The enemy is at (2, 9). If the enemy goes DOWN repeatedly, they'd be at:\n- Turn 2: (2, 8)\n- Turn 3: (2, 7)\n- Turn 4: (2, 6)\n- Turn 5: (2, 5)\n\nSo if the enemy heads straight for (2, 5), they'd get there in 4 moves. I can get there in 2 moves, so I'll definitely beat them.\n\nBut wait, the enemy might go for (5, 7) which is closer to them. From (2, 9):\n- (5, 7): distance 3+2=5 moves\n- (2, 5): distance 4 moves\n\nSo (2, 5) is actually closer to the enemy. But I can still beat them since I'm only 2 moves away.\n\nLet me go with DOWN. This puts me at (1, 5), and next turn I'll go RIGHT to (2, 5) to collect the apple.\n\nStrategy notes for next turn:\n- After collecting (2, 5), head toward the cluster at (7, 5)/(7, 6) or (5, 7)\n- Watch out for the enemy's movements\n\nDOWN\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\nMy head is at (1, 6) and the enemy snake head is at (2, 9).\n\nLet me analyze each possible move:\n- **UP to (1, 7)**: Safe - moves toward apple at (5, 7)\n- **DOWN to (1, 5)**: Safe - moves toward the closest apple at (2, 5)\n- **LEFT to (0, 6)**: Safe but moves away from apples\n- **RIGHT to (2, 6)**: Safe - also moves toward apple at (2, 5)\n\nThe enemy at (2, 9) can't reach any of my possible positions this turn (they're at distance 3+ from all of them), so no collision risk.\n\nThe closest apple to me is at (2, 5):\n- From (1, 6), it's only 2 moves away (1 right + 1 down, or 1 down + 1 right)\n- The enemy would need 4 moves to reach it from (2, 9)\n\nI can definitely beat the enemy to this apple!\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. Move DOWN now to (1, 5) - continuing my previous strategy\n2. Next turn move RIGHT to (2, 5) to collect the apple\n3. After securing that apple, head toward the cluster at (7, 5)/(7, 6) or (5, 7)\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are equally good for reaching (2, 5), but I'll stick with DOWN to continue my stated plan from last turn.\n\nDOWN",

A . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head is at (1, 5). Let me check possible moves:\n- UP: (1, 6) - safe, no obstacles\n- DOWN: (1, 4) - safe, no obstacles\n- LEFT: (0, 5) - safe, no obstacles\n- RIGHT: (2, 5) - safe, and there's an APPLE here!\n\nSince I have no body, none of these moves would hit my own body.\n\nEnemy snake head is at (1, 9). Possible moves for enemy:\n- UP: (1, 10) - out of bounds, death\n- DOWN: (1, 8) - safe\n- LEFT: (0, 9) - safe\n- RIGHT: (2, 9) - safe\n\nThe enemy is at (1, 9), which is directly above me at y=9 (I'm at y=5). They can't reach my possible positions this turn.\n\nCollision risk analysis:\n- If I move RIGHT to (2, 5), can the enemy reach (2, 5)? From (1, 9), the enemy can move to (0, 9), (1, 8), or (2, 9). None of these are (2, 5), so no collision.\n\nThe apple at (2, 5) is RIGHT NEXT TO ME! I should definitely go RIGHT to collect it!\n\nLet me verify:\n- My head is at (1, 5)\n- Apple is at (2, 5)\n- Moving RIGHT takes me from (1, 5) to (2, 5)\n- That's exactly where the apple is!\n\nThis is the optimal move - I'll collect an apple immediately!\n\nAfter collecting this apple:\n- My head will be at (2, 5)\n- My body will have one segment at (1, 5) (where my head was)\n- I'll have 1 apple\n\nStrategy for next turns:\nAfter collecting (2, 5), I should head toward the cluster at (7, 5)/(7, 6) or (5, 7). From (2, 5):\n- (5, 7): distance = |2-5| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n- (7, 5): distance = |2-7| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5 moves\n- (7, 6): distance = |2-7| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves\n\nThe enemy at (1, 9) might go for (5, 7). From (1, 9):\n- (5, 7): distance = |1-5| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves\n\nSo I can potentially beat the enemy to (5, 7) or (7, 5).\n\nActually, from (2, 5), going RIGHT toward (7, 5) makes sense since it's on the same row (y=5). I can go RIGHT repeatedly: (2,5) \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 (7,5). That's 5 moves in a straight line.\n\nBut I need to be careful about my body. After eating the apple at (2, 5), my tail will be at (1, 5). On the next turn, if I move RIGHT again to (3, 5), my body will be at (2, 5) and my tail at (1, 5) will disappear (since I only have 1 segment after eating 1 apple).\n\nWait, let me think about snake growth mechanics:\n- Before eating apple: head only, length 1\n- After eating apple at (2, 5): head at (2, 5), body at (1, 5), length 2\n\nSo next turn, my snake is: head at (2, 5), body segment at (1, 5).\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 5):\n- New head at (3, 5)\n- Previous head position (2, 5) becomes body\n- Tail at (1, 5) moves forward, so body is just at (2, 5)\n- Result: head at (3, 5), body at (2, 5), length 2\n\nYes, that makes sense. The snake length stays at 2 until I eat another apple.\n\nPlan:\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (2, 5) - collect apple\n2. Next turns: Continue RIGHT toward (7, 5) or adjust based on enemy movement\n3. Try to collect (7, 5) and (7, 6) which are close together\n\nRIGHT is clearly the best move this turn!\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\nMy head is at (1, 5) and there's an apple RIGHT NEXT TO ME at (2, 5)! This is perfect - I followed my plan from last turn and now I'm in position to collect the apple.\n\nLet me verify my moves are safe:\n- **UP to (1, 6)**: Safe, but misses the apple\n- **DOWN to (1, 4)**: Safe, but moves away from apple\n- **LEFT to (0, 5)**: Safe, but moves away from apple\n- **RIGHT to (2, 5)**: Safe AND collects the apple!\n\nThe enemy is at (1, 9) - they can only move to (0, 9), (1, 8), or (2, 9) this turn. None of these positions would collide with my move to (2, 5).\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (2, 5) - collect the apple! (Score: 0 \u2192 1)\n2. After collecting, head RIGHT toward the cluster at (7, 5)/(7, 6)\n3. From (2, 5), I can reach (7, 5) in 5 moves going mostly RIGHT\n4. The apple at (5, 7) is also reachable as an alternative\n5. Watch enemy movements - they might go for (5, 7) from their position\n\nThis is an easy decision - collect the apple right next to me!\n\nRIGHT",

This is where my body/tail is. Moving into my own body = death!\n- RIGHT: (3, 5) - safe, empty space\n\nSo LEFT is immediately eliminated as it would kill me.\n\nNow let's think about which of UP, DOWN, or RIGHT is best:\n\nApples:\n- (6, 0) - distance from (2, 5): |2-6| + |5-0| = 4 + 5 = 9 moves\n- (5, 7) - distance from (2, 5): |2-5| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n- (7, 5) - distance from (2, 5): |2-7| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5 moves (same row!)\n- (7, 6) - distance from (2, 5): |2-7| + |5-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves\n- (2, 2) - distance from (2, 5): |2-2| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3 moves (same column!)\n\nThe apple at (2, 2) is closest at 3 moves, and it's directly below me (same x-coordinate). If I go DOWN three times, I'll reach it.\n\nThe apple at (7, 5) is on the same row (y=5), so I could go RIGHT 5 times to reach it.\n\nThe apple at (5, 7) is 5 moves away.\n\nEnemy snake at (2, 9):\nThe enemy is at (2, 9) with no body. Possible enemy moves:\n- UP: (2, 10) - out of bounds, death\n- DOWN: (2, 8) - safe\n- LEFT: (1, 9) - safe\n- RIGHT: (3, 9) - safe\n\nThe enemy probably won't move UP (death). They might go for the apple at (5, 7) which is distance |2-5| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves.\n\nCollision analysis:\nIf I move UP to (2, 6), and the enemy moves DOWN to (2, 8), we're not colliding.\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 4), and the enemy moves DOWN to (2, 8), we're not colliding.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 5), and the enemy moves any direction, we're not colliding.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nStrategy:\n1. The apple at (2, 2) is closest and directly below me. Going DOWN three times gets me there.\n2. The cluster at (7, 5)/(7, 6) is also attractive - two apples close together.\n3. The apple at (5, 7) - the enemy might be going for this one.\n\nFrom my current position (2, 5), I think the best strategy is to:\n- Option A: Go DOWN toward (2, 2), collect it, then decide next target\n- Option B: Go RIGHT toward (7, 5)/(7, 6) cluster\n- Option C: Go UP toward (5, 7)\n\nLet's think about space and safety:\n- DOWN: Opens up the lower part of the board, apple at (2, 2) is 3 moves away\n- RIGHT: Opens up the right side with apples at (7, 5) and (7, 6)\n- UP: Moves toward (5, 7) but also gets closer to the enemy at (2, 9)\n\nI'm leaning toward going DOWN to collect (2, 2) first since it's the closest apple. After that, I can go for the cluster at (7, 5)/(7, 6).\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The cluster at (7, 5)/(7, 6) has TWO apples close together. If I go RIGHT and collect those two, I'd have 3 apples. The apple at (2, 2) is just one apple.\n\nBut the apple at (2, 2) is closer (3 moves vs 5 moves).\n\nLet me think about future paths:\n- If I go DOWN now, I'm at (2, 4). Next DOWN to (2, 3), then DOWN to (2, 2) - apple! Then I need to avoid my own body.\n- If I go RIGHT now, I'm at (3, 5). Continue RIGHT: (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5) - apple! Then UP to (7, 6) - another apple!\n\nThe enemy is in the upper part of the board. Going DOWN keeps me away from them. Going RIGHT puts me on a collision course potentially if they decide to come down.\n\nI'll go with DOWN to pursue the closest apple at (2, 2). It's safer as it keeps distance from the enemy.\n\nWait, I should also check: if I go DOWN to (2, 4), what are my options next turn?\n- From (2, 4): UP to (2, 5) - but my body will be there! Actually no, after I move, my tail moves forward. Let me think...\n\nCurrent: Head at (2, 5), body/tail at (1, 5). Length = 2.\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 4):\n- New head at (2, 4)\n- Previous head (2, 5) becomes body\n- Tail at (1, 5) disappears (moves forward)\n- Result: Head at (2, 4), body at (2, 5), length = 2\n\nNext turn from (2, 4):\n- UP to (2, 5) - but my body is at (2, 5)! This would be death.\n- DOWN to (2, 3) - safe\n- LEFT to (1, 4) - safe\n- RIGHT to (3, 4) - safe\n\nSo if I go DOWN, I can continue DOWN toward the apple, or go LEFT/RIGHT. I just can't go UP immediately.\n\nIf I go DOWN toward (2, 2):\nTurn 3: (2, 5) \u2192 (2, 4) [body at (2, 5)]\nTurn 4: (2, 4) \u2192 (2, 3) [body at (2, 4)]\nTurn 5: (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 2) - APPLE! [body at (2, 3), grows to include (2, 4)]\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (2, 2):\n- Head at (2, 2)\n- Body at (2, 3) and (2, 4) [length = 3]\n\nThen I can go RIGHT toward the (7, 5)/(7, 6) cluster.\n\nAlternative: If I go RIGHT toward (7, 5):\nTurn 3: (2, 5) \u2192 (3, 5) [body at (2, 5)]\nTurn 4: (3, 5) \u2192 (4, 5) [body at (3, 5)]\nTurn 5: (4, 5) \u2192 (5, 5) [body at (4, 5)]\nTurn 6: (5, 5) \u2192 (6, 5) [body at (5, 5)]\nTurn 7: (6, 5) \u2192 (7, 5) - APPLE! [body at (6, 5)]\n\nThat's 5 turns vs 3 turns for the closer apple.\n\nI'll go DOWN toward (2, 2). It's the closest apple and keeps me away from the enemy.\n\nActually, let me also consider UP:\nIf I go UP to (2, 6):\n- From (2, 6), I could head toward (5, 7) which is |2-5| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4 moves away.\n- But the enemy at (2, 9) might also be heading toward (5, 7).\n\nDistance from enemy (2, 9) to (5, 7): |2-5| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves.\nDistance from me (2, 5) to (5, 7) via UP: after moving UP to (2, 6), distance = |2-5| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4 moves.\n\nSo if I go UP, I can reach (5, 7) in 1+4 = 5 moves total from my current position.\nThe enemy can reach (5, 7) in 5 moves.\n\nWe'd both get there at the same time potentially - that's dangerous!\n\nGoing DOWN to (2, 2) is safer. I'll go DOWN.\n\nPlan for next few turns:\n1. Turn 3 (now): DOWN to (2, 4)\n2. Turn 4: DOWN to (2, 3)\n3. Turn 5: DOWN to (2, 2) - collect apple!\n4. Turn 6+: Go RIGHT toward (7, 5)/(7, 6) cluster\n\nActually wait, I should double-check the apple positions. Looking at the board again:\n\n```\n 9 . . 0 . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . A . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . A . .\n 5 . T 1 . . . .

Going DOWN is correct.\n\nFinal decision: DOWN\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n\nMy snake: Head at (2, 5), body at (1, 5), 1 apple collected.\nEnemy snake: Head at (2, 9), no body, 0 apples.\n\nLet me evaluate my options:\n- **UP to (2, 6)**: Safe, moves toward apple at (5, 7)\n- **DOWN to (2, 4)**: Safe, moves toward apple at (2, 2)\n- **LEFT to (1, 5)**: DEATH! My body/tail is there!\n- **RIGHT to (3, 5)**: Safe, moves toward cluster at (7, 5)/(7, 6)\n\nLEFT is eliminated immediately.\n\nNow comparing the safe moves:\n\n**Apple distances from my current position:**\n- (2, 2): 3 moves - directly below me, same column!\n- (7, 5): 5 moves - same row, just go right\n- (7, 6): 6 moves\n- (5, 7): 5 moves\n- (6, 0): 9 moves\n\nThe apple at (2, 2) is closest at just 3 moves. Going DOWN puts me on a direct path to collect it.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\n- Enemy at (2, 9) is in the upper portion of the board\n- They might go for (5, 7) - they're 5 moves away from it\n- If I race them to (5, 7), we might collide\n- Going DOWN keeps me safely away from the enemy\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: DOWN to (2, 4)\n2. Turn 4: DOWN to (2, 3)\n3. Turn 5: DOWN to (2, 2) - collect apple! (Score: 1 \u2192 2)\n4. After that: Head RIGHT toward (7, 5)/(7, 6) cluster for two more apples\n\nDOWN",
