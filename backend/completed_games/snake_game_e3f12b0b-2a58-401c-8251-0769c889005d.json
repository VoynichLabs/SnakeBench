This doesn't affect our current move options.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After eating the apple at (5, 2), our next targets should be the apple at (6, 0) or (9, 3).\n- We should avoid getting too close to Snake #1's growing body, especially near (2, 6) and (2, 7).\n- Maintain flexibility to move in multiple directions to avoid being trapped.\n- Keep an eye on the apple at (6, 0) as it's relatively isolated and could be a safe target.\n\nRIGHT is the clear best move here as it gives us an immediate point and growth while keeping us safe.\n\nRIGHT",

This is a better long-term move as it keeps me closer to the apple at (6, 9) and away from Snake #1's body.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 possible moves from (9, 4):**\n- UP: (9, 5) - Currently empty.\n- DOWN: (9, 3) - Its own body, death.\n- LEFT: (8, 4) - Currently empty.\n- RIGHT: (10, 4) - Off the board, death.\n\nSnake #1 is likely to move UP to (9, 5) or LEFT to (8, 4) to avoid death. Moving DOWN or RIGHT is not viable.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Prioritize moving toward the apple at (6, 9) while avoiding Snake #1's likely path.\n- Avoid moving too close to Snake #1's head or body, especially near its likely next positions.\n- Keep options open to pivot toward other apples if Snake #1's path changes.\n- The apple at (6, 9) is a good target, as it is far from Snake #1's current position and likely path.\n\n**Decision:**\n- RIGHT to (2, 9) is the best move. It moves me toward the apple at (6, 9), keeps future options open, and avoids Snake #1's likely path.\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (5, 8) is now 1 move away (DOWN).\n- Snake #1 is stretched horizontally along the bottom of the board, with its head at (6, 2). Its body is dense along y=1 and y=2, making the bottom rows risky.\n- The apple at (5, 8) is the closest and safest to reach. The apple at (3, 5) is also reachable but closer to Snake #1\u2019s potential path.\n- Snake #1\u2019s head is at (6, 2), and its viable moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. It may move toward the apple at (5, 2) or (3, 4).\n\n**Possible moves from (6, 9):**\n1. UP: (6, 10) - Off the board, death.\n2. DOWN: (6, 8) - Currently empty. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (5, 9) - My own body, death (directly backwards).\n4. RIGHT: (7, 9) - Currently empty. Safe.\n\nEliminate UP and LEFT as they cause immediate death.\n\n**Analysis of remaining options:**\n- DOWN to (6, 8): Moves me closer to the apple at (5, 8). This is safe and keeps me away from Snake #1\u2019s current position. The path to (5, 8) is clear next turn.\n- RIGHT to (7, 9): Moves me away from the apple at (5, 8) and toward the top-right corner, which is a dead-end.

LEFT would collect the apple at (5, 2), while UP would move it toward the apple at (3, 4). Either way, Snake #1 is likely to stay in the bottom half of the board, so DOWN to (6, 8) is safe.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Collect the apple at (5, 8) next turn by moving DOWN to (6, 8) now, then LEFT to (5, 8) next turn.\n- After collecting, reassess the board for the next closest apple. The apple at (3, 5) is reachable but may be contested by Snake #1.\n- Avoid moving into tight spaces or dead-ends. Keep options open to pivot toward (3, 5) or (3, 4) if Snake #1\u2019s path changes.\n- Prioritize apples that are isolated from Snake #1\u2019s likely path.\n\n**Decision:**\n- DOWN to (6, 8) is the safest and most rewarding move.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT: (6, 8) - My own body, death (directly into body).\n\nEliminate UP and RIGHT as they cause immediate death.\n\n**Analysis of remaining options:**\n- DOWN to (5, 7): Moves toward the apple at (6, 7). This is safe and keeps options open for future moves toward (8, 9) or (3, 5). The path to (6, 7) is clear next turn.\n- LEFT to (4, 8): Moves toward the left side of the board, which is less crowded but also less rewarding. The apple at (3, 5) is reachable but may be contested by Snake #1.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 possible moves from (4, 2):**\n- UP: (4, 3) - Currently empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (4, 1) - Its own body, death.\n- LEFT: (3, 2) - Currently empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5, 2) - Its own body, death.\n\nSnake #1\u2019s viable moves are UP to (4, 3) or LEFT to (3, 2). UP would move it toward the apples at (3, 4) or (3, 5), while LEFT would move it toward the left side. Either way, Snake #1 is unlikely to interfere with my move to (5, 7).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Move DOWN to (5, 7) this turn to position myself closer to the apple at (6, 7).\n- Next turn, move RIGHT to (6, 7) to collect the apple.\n- After collecting, reassess the board for the next closest apple. The apple at (8, 9) is reachable but may require careful pathing to avoid being cornered. The apple at (3, 5) is also reachable but may be contested by Snake #1.\n- Avoid moving into tight spaces or dead-ends. Keep options open to pivot toward (8, 9) or (3, 5) if Snake #1\u2019s path changes.\n- Prioritize apples that are isolated from Snake #1\u2019s likely path.\n\n**Decision:**\n- DOWN to (5, 7) is the safest and most rewarding move.\n\nDOWN",

It is unlikely to contest the apple at (8, 9) in the near future.\n- The apple at (8, 9) is isolated and not threatened by Snake #1. Other apples are either too far or too risky to pursue.\n- My snake's body is extended vertically along x=3 to x=8, which could limit mobility if not managed carefully.\n\n**Possible moves from (8, 8):**\n1.

This is the most rewarding move, as it collects the apple and grows my snake. The next turn, I will need to plan a safe path away from the wall.\n- DOWN to (8, 7): Moves away from the apple at (8, 9) and toward the center. Less ideal for immediate reward but keeps options open. However, this delays collecting the apple and may allow Snake #1 to gain more apples.\n- RIGHT to (9, 8): Moves away from the apple at (8, 9) and toward the edge. Not ideal for long-term strategy.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 possible moves from (2, 5):**\n- UP: (2, 6) - Currently empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (2, 4) - Its own body (part of its tail).

This is the safest and most rewarding move.\n- After collecting the apple, plan a safe path away from the wall. The next move could be LEFT to (7, 9) or DOWN to (8, 8), but LEFT to (7, 9) is safer to avoid getting trapped.\n- Avoid moving into tight spaces or dead-ends. Keep options open to pivot if Snake #1 changes its path.\n- Monitor Snake #1\u2019s movements to ensure it does not threaten my path to other apples.\n\n**Decision:**\n- UP to (8, 9) is the safest and most rewarding move, as it collects the apple and grows my snake.\n\nUP",

The body is coiled vertically along x=7 and x=8, with the tail at (4, 9).\n- Snake #1's head is at (1, 4), and its body is densely packed along the bottom rows (y=2 to y=4), extending to the right edge. It is longer and has more apples, so it is a significant threat.\n- The closest apple to my head is at (5, 3), but it is still distant. The other apples are even farther away.\n- My snake's body is long and coiled, so I must be cautious about trapping myself in tight spaces or dead-ends.\n- Snake #1's head is at (1, 4), and its body blocks much of the lower half of the board. It is unlikely to threaten my snake immediately unless I move into its path.\n\n**Possible moves from (7, 9):**\n1. UP: (7, 10) - Off the board. Death.\n2. DOWN: (7, 8) - My own body (third segment). Death.\n3. LEFT: (6, 9) - Currently empty. Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (8, 9) - My own body (first segment). Death.\n\nEliminate UP, DOWN, and RIGHT as they cause immediate death.\n\n**Analysis of remaining option:**\n- LEFT to (6, 9): Moves away from the wall and into open space. This is the only safe move available. After moving LEFT, I will be at (6, 9), which is adjacent to my body at (6, 8) and (5, 9). This move keeps me along the top edge but opens up more options for future turns.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 possible moves from (1, 4):**\n- UP: (1, 5) - Currently empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (1, 3) - Currently empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (0, 4) - Apple. Safe and likely to be chosen.\n- RIGHT: (2, 4) - Its own body (first segment). Death.\n\nSnake #1\u2019s most likely moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. LEFT to (0, 4) is particularly likely because it moves toward an apple. This could extend its body further left, but it is not an immediate threat to my snake.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Move LEFT to (6, 9) to avoid getting trapped in the corner. This keeps me along the top edge but opens up more options for future moves.\n- After moving LEFT, assess the board for the closest apples. The apple at (5, 3) is the most reachable, but I need to plan a safe path toward it while avoiding Snake #1\u2019s body.\n- Avoid moving into tight spaces or dead-ends. Keep options open to pivot if Snake #1 changes its path.\n- Monitor Snake #1\u2019s movements to ensure it does not threaten my path to other apples. If possible, try to cut off its path or force it into a position with fewer safe moves.\n- If Snake #1 moves toward the apple at (0, 4), it may extend its body further left, which could create opportunities for me to maneuver around it.\n\n**Decision:**\n- LEFT to (6, 9) is the only safe move available. It avoids immediate death and keeps future options open.\n\nLEFT",
