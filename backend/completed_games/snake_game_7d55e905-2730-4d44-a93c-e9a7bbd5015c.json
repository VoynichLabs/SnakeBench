That would be a head-on collision, killing both snakes and resulting in a draw (scores tied 10\u201310). Too risky when we have a safe, strong alternative.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,8)**: contains an apple, no body there, and the enemy cannot reach (5,8) this turn from (4,6). We gain 1 apple and lengthen, and after the move we will still have at least one clearly safe direction (RIGHT to (6,8)) even if the enemy moves aggressively.\n\nSo the only non-suicidal and non-contested move that improves our position is **RIGHT** onto the apple at (5,8).\n\n**Strategy note to future self (next few turns):**\n- After eating at (5,8), favor **RIGHT to (6,8)** rather than going DOWN into contested cells near the enemy (like (5,7)), to avoid head-on risks.\n- Then start turning down the right side toward the open lower-right area and the apple at (9,0), letting our long tail clear space behind. Avoid re-entering the crowded top row until the board opens up again.\n\nRIGHT",
