Next apple is at (6,9), which is directly above me and reachable in one step.\n\nEnemy snake is positioned at (8,9) with a body extending down the last column (9th x), so enemy occupies (8,9), and (9,9),(9,8),(9,7),(9,6).\n\nThe apple at (6,9) is adjacent and accessible next move.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Moving UP to (6,9) will eat that apple, gain 1 point, and grow.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5,8) or RIGHT to (7,8) or DOWN to (6,7) are less optimal because the apple just above is close and safe.\n\nNo collision threat by moving UP.\n\nIs there any danger of moving UP?\n\nWe don't occupy (6,9) now, only the apple. The enemy is occupied at (8,9), not (6,9).\n\nTherefore, moving UP is safe.\n\nAfter eating (6,9), strategy should be to target another apple, perhaps (4,8) which is near by (just two spaces left horizontally on the same row), or consider the enemy's head at (8,9).\n\nBut for now, let's just grab that apple.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
